 jaevgas yaa byogas vah gas mishran he jo oxygen kii anupasthiti main jaivik saamagree ke vighatan se utpann hoti he
 It is a renewable energy source just like solar and wind power
 byogas sthaneey uplabdh kachche padaarthon evam kachra se paidaa kii ja sakati he
 It is eco-friendly and co2-neutral
 byogas jeevashm eendhan se banaaya ja saktaa he yaa mrit jaivsaamagree se
 Biogas is mostly preferred over fossil fuels
 kam maatra main carbon vaataavaran ke liye swasth hota he, lekin adhik hone par yah takalifdeh ban jaataa he
 Carbon has been present in fossil fuels for so long that it is no longer part of the carbon cycle
 jeevashm eendhan ke jalane par carbon kaa str badhata he
 Biogas is made from recent dead organisms, so it does not disturb the carbon level in the atmosphere
 byogas jeevashm eendhan ke bajaay isliye bhi behatar he kyonki yah sasta or naveekrut urja he
 It is beneficial for developing countries because it can be made in small plants, but some say that the fuel derived from crops will cause food shortages and will lead to forest erosion, water and soil pollution, or oil
 Producing countries will be negatively affected
 byogas plant main pashuon ke vyarth padaarth yaa energy crops ke upyog se byogas banaai jaati he
 Energy crops are grown for biofuels rather than food
 biophul biomas kahe jane vaale mrit organic tatwon se banaaya jaataa he or yah taral, gasiy yaa thos rup main ho saktaa he
 a biogas plant has a digester and a gas holder to manufacture fuel
 plant kaa digester airtite hota he jisamen vyarth padaarth daalaa jaataa he or gas holder main gas kaa sangrahan hota he
 The construction of a biogas plant depends on the gas requirement and the availability of waste material
 saath hi digester ke batch feeding yaa lagaataar feeding par bhi
 The biogas plant is built on or below the ground surface and both models have their advantages and disadvantages
 sataha par bana plant rakh-rakhaav main aasaan hota he or use suraj kii garmi se bhi laabh hota he, lekin iske nirmaan main adhik dhyaan dena hota he kyonki vahaan digester ke andruni dabaav par dhyaan dena hota he
 In contrast, plants below the surface are easy to construct but difficult to maintain
 bharat main maweshiyon kii sankhya vishwa main sarvaadhik he isliye byogas ke vikaas kii prachur sambhaavna he
 Biogas is obtained by producing microbes by driving the excretory substances of cattle into the digester at low temperatures
 jaev gas main 75 pratishat methen gas hoti he jo bina dhunaa utpann kiye jalati he
 Unlike wood, charcoal and coal, it does not leave any residue like ash after burning
 gramin ilaakon main bhojan pakaane tathaa eendhan ke rup main prakaash kii vyavastha karne main iskaa upyog ho rahaa he
 Two types of family or domestic and community plants are established under the National Biogas Development Program
 isse svachh va sasti urja aapurti tathaa gramin paryaavaran kii safai ke saath hi ucch koti kii carbonic khaad bhi prapti hoti he kyonki jaev gas ke liye prayukt gobar tathaa jal ke kardam main nitrogen va phosphorus prachur maatra main hote hai
 Caution should only be taken that there is no drinking water source within a 15 meter radius of the biogas plant
 bharat ke tarai evam maidani kshetron main gobar ko upalon ke rup main sukha kar eendhan ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 This kills most of the nutritional elements present in dung
 upala banane main pratidin kareeb 1-2 ghante samay bhi lagata he
 Therefore, instead of using cow dung for cooking, making bio gas from cow dung, using bio gas as fuel does not harm the nutrients because all the nutrients available to the plants are available in the bio gas slurry obtained from bio gas
 While living, there is no smoke in cooking, which does not have any adverse effect on the eyes of the housewife
 baio gas slori ko sidhe yaa chaaya main sukhaakar yaa varmi compost banaakar khaad ke rup main kheton main prayog karnaa chahie
 Nowadays diesel pump sets can also be run with bio gas, which saves diesel and other energy
 byogas sanyantr main gobar kii pachan kriya ke baad 25% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar gas ke rup main hota he or 75% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar khaad ke rup main hota he
 In a 2 cubic meter gas plant, in which about 50 kg of cow dung or 18-25 tons of dung is added in a year, about 10 tons of biogas slurry containing 80% moisture is obtained from that cow dung
 yah kheti ke liye ati uttam khaad hota he isamen nitrogen 1
5 se 2% phosphorus 1
0% evam potash 1
0% tak hota he
 When the fertilizer comes out in the form of slurry from the biogas plant, the nitrogen is present in the slurry as much nitrogen is also present in the slurry, but during the digestion in the plant, there is evidence of carbon conversion in the gas due to reduced carbon nitrogen
 The ratio decreases and the evidence of nitrogen appears to be increased
 byogas sanyantra se nikali patali slori main 20% nitrogen amo
 nikal nitrogen ke rup main hota he atah yadi iskaa turant upyog khet main naaliyaan banaakar athwa sinchai ke pani main milakar khet main chhod diya jaae to iskaa laabh rasinic khaad kii tarah se fasal par turant hota he or utpaadan main 10 se 20 In the biogas plant, after digestion of cow dung, 25% solids are converted into gas and 75% solids are converted to manure
 2 ghan meter ke gas sanyantr main jisamen kareeb 50 kilo gobar roj yaa 18-25 ton gobar ek varsh main daalaa jaataa he, us gobar se 80% namiyukt kareeb 10 ton byogas slori kaa khaad praapt hota he
 It is a very good manure for farming, it contains nitrogen 1
5 to 2% phosphorus 1
0% and potash 1
0%
 byogas sanyantra se jab slori ke rup main khaad baahar aata he tab jitna nitrogen gobar main hota he utana hi nitrogen slori main bhi hota he, parantu sanyantra main pachan kriya ke dauraan carbon kaa roopaantar gas main hone se carbon kaa pramaan kam hone se carbon nitrogen anupaat kam ho jaataa he va isse nitrogen kaa pramaan badha hua prathit hota he
 20% nitrogen amo in thin slurry produced from biogas plant
 Nickel is in the form of nitrogen, so if it is used immediately by making drains in the field or mixed with irrigation water and left in the field, then its benefits like chemical fertilizers are immediately on the crop and increase in production by 10 to 20%
 Can
 slori khaad ko sukhaane ke baad usamen nitrogen kaa kuch bhaag hawa main ud jaataa he
 This fertilizer is applied in non-irrigated farming in evidence of about 5 tonnes per hectare and in irrigated farming 10 tonnes per hectare
 byogas slori ke khaad main mukhya tatwon ke atirikt sookshm poshak tatv evam humas bhi hota he jisase mitti kaa pot sudharta he, jaldharan kshamta badhati he or sookshm jeevanu badhate he
 With the use of this manure, like other organic manure, nutrients are gradually available to the crops for 3 years
 yadi gobar gas sanyantr ghar ke paas va khet se dur he tab patali slori ko sangrahan karne ke liye bahut jagah lagati he va patali slori kaa sthaanantaran bhi kathin hota he aisi avasthaa main slori ko sookhaana aavashyak he
 For this, the method of Gramopayogi filtration tank has been developed
 isamen byogas ke nikaas kaksh se jodakar 2 ghanmeter ke sanyantra ke liye 1
65 meter × 0
6 meter × 0
5 meter ke do cement ke tanks banaaye jate hai isaki duusari taraf chana hua pani ekatra karne hetu ek pakkaa gaddha banaaya jaataa he
 15 cm below in the filtration tank
 Thick garbage, dry waste, green waste, etc
 are added
 is par nikaas kaksh se jab drav rup kii slori girti he tab slori kaa pani kachare ke thar se chhan kar neeche gaddhe main ekatra ho jaataa he
 In this way, 2 / 3 of the water that is put into the biogas plant at the time of cow dung is collected and re-collected in the pits, mixing it with cow dung and re-pumping it to the plant increases gas production
 iske alaava isamen sabhi poshak tatv ghulansheel avasthaa main hote he atah paudhon par chhidkaav karne se paudhon kaa vikaas acha hota he, evam fal main vruddhi hoti he
 In about 15-20 days, the first tank is filled, then the tank is covered and the slurry is opened in the second tank, it can be stored separately in pits or it is easy to fill the bullock cart and reach the field
 filtreshan tanks kii madad se kam jagah main adhik byogas kii slori kaa sangrahan kiya ja saktaa he va filtard pani ke baahar nikalne va uskaa sanyantra main punah upyog karne se pani kii bhi bachat hoti he
 In this way, the biogas plant solves the problem of biogas fuel, as well as the best manure in the form of slurry is also obtained for agriculture

 There was also a lack of democratic governance and individual freedoms
 roosi buddhijivi or madhyamvarg inke liye icchhuk tha par jaarshahi damanniti ke kaaran inaki prapti kaa sanvaidhanik maarg avaruddhapraay tha

 The name "khap Panchayat" must have been heard by almost everyone now! For the last few days, this has been very much discussed and the reason for this being in the discussion is the unique decrees issued by them, which have been dubbed by the people as Tughlaqi decrees! khap panchayato kaa itihaas bahut purana he or ye mahabharat kaal se lekar ramayana kaal or uske baad mogul shashan kaa safar karte hue ab is ikisvi sadi ke samaaj main apane vajood ke saath aaj bhi kaayam he ! It is said that "when Lord Shiva was insulted by not calling Lord Daksha in the yajna, Parvati ji could not bear this insult and he gave up his life by jumping into the fire of the sacrificial fire of the yagna, when Shiva knew this If felt, he was very angry and then he ordered Virabhadra to go with his gun army and destroy King Daksha's sacrifice and cut off his head ”! Khap Panchayato that this is considered to be the oldest event! ramayana kaal main bhi in khap panchayato kaa ullekh miltaa he, kaha jaataa he ki hanuman ji ki vanar sena vastav main ek sarv khap panchayat hi thi jisame bhil, kol, vanar, rich, jataayu, raghuvanshi aadi vibhinn jatiyon tathaa khapo ke log sammilit the lekin kyoki isamen vanar adhik the isliye inhen vanar sena kaha gaya ! is sena ke adhyakshata maharaja sugriv ne ki thi or inke salaahkaar the vir jamavant ! Era changed with the cycle of time, but these khap panchayats continued to be seen in every era
 No one could shake the existence of these khap panchayats from the Satyuga to the Mughal rule and then to the British rule! In the Mughal period, these panchayats were resorted to in order to give a healthy environment to the society, because at that time the Raja could not solve the problem by meeting every person privately, so these khap panchayats became necessary! This then began to work as a kind of administration system and the Panchayats started making small and big decisions of the villages and provinces, instead they got high rank and other gifts from the kings! Every decision taken by him was necessary to obey all the villages and provinces under his rule! lekin bharat ki azaadi ke baad se in khap panchayato ki takaton ko desh ke raajnneetigyon ne bhalee bhaanti bhaap liya ! or tab ye raajnneetijna is baat ko acchhee tarah se samaj chuke the ki pancho dwaara liya gaya koi bhi faisla gaanv ke har vyakti ke liye kisi pathar kii lakeer ke samaan hi tha or us lakeer ko mitaane kii himmat kisi main bhi naa thi or yahi vajah rahi kii raajnneetigyon dwaara in khap panchayato kaa istemaal apane vot bank ko badhaane ke liye kiya jane laga or yahi se ye khap panchayate siyaasi rup lene lagi jinka laabh rajanetao ne jam kar uthaaya ! or aaj isaki baangi hame inke tughluqi farmaanon ke rup main dekhne ko mil rahi he ! Today, this khap panchayat is demanding an amendment in the Hindu Marriage Act, demanding that the government "make the marriages in one tribe illegal" because they believe that all boys and girls of a gotra are brothers and sisters
 Then no matter how many generations have passed! Due to this same thinking, he collected ten rupees from every house to save the culprits of Manoj and Babli murder because Manoj and Babli belonged to the same gotra and hence according to them, the killers were not guilty but Manoj and Babli were guilty
 Who married in the same gotra! But if their demand for not getting married in a gotra is accepted, then as many people who are in support of it today may be against it as Dakshid in India is not only in a gotra but a sister for her own son Also accepts the brother's daughter as a bride and there is no opposition to it! lekin aaj ye khap panchayate rajanetao ke liye apane vot jutaney main bahut madadgaar sabit ho rahi he jaisaa kii maine pehle bhi bataaya kii in panchayato dwaara liya gaya koi bhi faisla inke adheen aane vaale sabhi gaanvo ke liye maanya hota he to usee kaa phayda ye rajaneta uthaa rahe he kyoki in pancho kaa ek faisla bhi takhta palat karne kii himmat rakhata he zyada din nahin hue jab 84 gaanvo vaali baaliyaan khap ke pramukh mahendra singh ticket ne kisaan aandolan chalaa kar us vaqt puri satta ko hilaa kar rakh diya tha or yahi wo mul vajah he jisaki vajah se aaj ye panchayate aaj ke is yug main ye apana aadhipaty sthapit kiye hue he ! aaj ye panchayate apana samaajik daayitv bhul kar siyaasi rang main rang chuki he or inako rokna matlab apni satta ko khone jaisaa he kyoki inaki virodh main jo bhi satta kadam uthaaegi wo shaayad dobaaraa desh main shashan nahin kar paayegi ! So should today's society keep these Tughlaqi decrees silently xxrep 4 ? Because as long as these leaders continue to consider them as their vote bank, then no change can be seen in the decisions of these panchayats! doshi ko ek nayaa jivan dene kaa prayaas karti he
 On the basis of long experience, our ancestors have given birth to this social justice system which has many levels
 jab gotra or gavahand kii panchayatein bhi kisi samasya kaa nidaan nahin kar paati to ek bade kshetra ke logon ko ikaitha karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he jisamen anek gavahandi kshetra, anek gotreey kshetra or kareeb-kareeb sabhi hindu jatiyon ke sanghathan shaamil hote hai
 This wide area is called Khap
 kahin-kahin ise paal ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Area of wakandi is 5-7 km
 Is limited to a few or a few selected villages
 jabaki paal yaa khap kaa kshetra aseemit hota he
 The villages of every khap are fixed, such as 12 villages of Barwasani Barh, 17 villages of Karala Seventeen, 5 villages of Chauhan Khap, 84 villages of Tomar Khap, 40 villages of Dahiya Chalisa, 365 villages of Palam Khap, 24 villages of Mitrol Khap e

 23 april 1857 ko meerut chhavnee main sainik vidroh hua or 10 may 1857 ko sarvakhap panchayat ke veeron ne angrejon ko goli se uda diya
 On 11 May 1857, 5000 Mall warriors of the Panchayati Army led by Chaudhary Shahmal village Bijrol of Chaurasi Khap Tomar invaded Delhi
 shamali ke mohar singh ne aas-paas ke kshetron par kabiz angrejon ko khatm kar diya
 The Sarvakhap Panchayat appealed to the public to assist Chaudhary Shahmal and Mohar Singh
 is jan samarthan se mohar singh ne shamali, thana bhawan, padasauli ko angrejon se mukt kara liya gaya
 In the forests of Banat, there was a fierce battle between the Panchayati Army and the weaponized English army in which Mohar Singh Veer gained momentum but the British did not survive
 chouhanon, panvaron or tomaron ne ramala chhavnee kaa namonishaan mitaa diya
 The Malla warriors of the Sarvakhap Panchayat finally ended the British rule from Delhi and put Bahadur Shah on the throne of Delhi
 30 or 31 may 1857 ko maare gaye kuch angrej sipaahiyon or adhikariyon kii kabren gajiabad jile main meerut maarg par hindon nadi ke tat par dekhi ja sakati hai
 In July 1857, the British Army was determined to capture the revolutionary leader Shahmal, but about 7 thousand soldiers armed peasants and zamindars fought fiercely
 shahamal ke bhattije bhagat ke hamale se bal-bal bachakar sena kaa netritv kar rahaa anges afasar danlap bhaag khadaa hua or bhagat ne use badot tak khadeda
 At this time, there were 2000 powerful farmers with Shahmal
 gorilla yuddh pranali main vishesh maharath hasil karne vaale shahamal or unke anuyaayiyon kaa badot ke dakshin ke ek baag main khaaki risaala se aamane saamne ghamaasan yuddh hua
 Dunlop narrowly escaped from the hands of Shahmal's nephew Bhagata
 But Shahmal, who was fighting with an organ guard on his horse, was surrounded by the Firangi
 usne apni talwaar ke wo kartab dikhaae ki firangi dang rah gaye
 When the sword fell, Shahmal continued to attack the enemies with his spear
 is daur main uski pagadi khul gai or ghode ke pairon main funs gai
 Taking advantage of this, a foreigner rider dropped him from the horse
 angrej afasar parkar, jo shahamal ko pahachaanata tha, ne shahamal ke sharir ke tukde-tukde karvaa die or uskaa sar kaat kar ek bhaale ke upar tangava diya
 Later, the British again came to power and they went through a heavy repression cycle
 sarvakhap panchayat phir se niskriy ho gai
 The Sarvakhap Panchayat saw many ups and downs during the Muslim period, but the British were great drivers and they attacked the roots of the Sarvakhap Panchayat
 vishaal haryana ko uttar pradesh, punjab, rajasthan or madhya pradesh aadi praanton main vibhajit kar diya
 In the British government, Lord Macaulay banned Sarvakhap Panchayat
 falswaroop 1947 tak khule rup main panchayat kaa aayojan nahin ho sakaa
 In the year 1924, Baisakhi Amavasya was the Panchayat of Sarvakhap in Soram village, in which Chaudhary Kabul Singh of Soram was unanimously appointed as the General Secretary of Sarvakhap Panchayat
 ve is sanghathan ke 28 wein mahaamantri bataaye jate hai
 They have complete records of Sarvakhap Panchayat from Emperor Harsh Vardhan to independent India, which is the responsibility of the Panchayati guards
 is ricard ko bachaae rakhane ke liye panchayat sena ne bada khun bahaya he
 The Sarvakhap Panchayat was organized in village Soram on 8, 9 March 1950 in Azad India under the preponderance of Pandit Jagdev Singh Siddhanti headmistress Gurukul Maha Vidyalaya Kirthal
 isamen 6 xxrep 4 0 panchon ne bhaag liya tha
 After that former judge Shri Mahavir Singh was made the head of Haryana Sarvakhap
 12 june 1983 or 5 march 1988 ko swami karmpal ji kii adhyakshata main do baar haryana sarvakhap kii panchayatein huin jinamein jat jati ke utthan par vichaar kar samaaj ko disha nirdesh jari kiye gaye
 After independence, the Panchayati Raj system came into force, this reduced the importance of the Sarvakhap system
 ab vot kii raajnneeti hone se jatiyon ne alag-alag panchayatein banaali hai
 The importance of ethnic panchayats, gotra panchayats, Palas and Khapas has increased
 aajkal log nyaayalaon main prakarnon kaa niraakaran chaahate hai isamen samay or dhan donon kii hi barbaadi hoti he or anishchit lambe samay tak vivaadon kaa niraakaran bhi nahin ho paata he
 Today All India Jat Mahasabha is the highest institution of Jats
 iske adheen pradeshon main pradeshik jat maha sabhaayen kaam kar rahi hai
 Analyzing the word Khap, we see that Khap is made up of two words
 ye shabd hai 'kha' or 'aap'
 kha kaa arth he akaash or aap kaa arth he jal arthath aisa sanghathan jo akaash kii tarah sarvopari ho or pani kii tarah svachh, nirmal or sab ke liye uplabdh arthath nyaayakari ho
 Now Khap is considered an organization that includes some villages, people from many gotras or people from the same gotra
 inkaa ek hi kshetra main hona jaruri nahin he
 The villages of a khap can also be far away
 badi khaapon se nikal kar kai choti khaapon ne bhi janm liya he
 The villages of Khap are free to move from one Khap to another Khap
 isi kaaran samay ke saath khap kaa swarup badalata rahaa he
 Today about 3500 khap of Jats are in existence
 pichley kuch samay se ‘khap’ panchayatein charchaa main hai
 She has been in the discussion before, due to the issuance of death decree to love-couples, but this time the issue of discussion is a bit serious
 is baar unhone jis prakaar se sagotra vivaah ke khilaaf apana talibani jhandaa buland kiya he or jis prakaar chautaala se lekar gadakari tak apni chhudra raajnneeti ke kaaran unke sur main sur mila rahe hai, usase maamla zyada gambheer ho gaya he
 Khap panchayats are actually a conservative part of ancient society, which is unable to reconcile with modern society and changing ideology
 iskaa saakshaat pramaan panchayaton ke vartmaan swaroop main dekha ja saktaa he, jisamen mahilaon or yuvaaon kaa pratinidhitiv na ke baraabar he
 If we study the attitude and social structure of these panchayats, the figures come out, they are quite worrisome
 jaise ki sampoorn khap panchayaton ke aria main mahila-purush kaa ling anupaat sabase kharaab he, jabaki in ilaakon main kanya bhrun hatya kaa ausat rashtriya ausat se kaaphi adhik he
 This clearly shows that the basic character of Khap Panchayats is anti-women
 yahi kaaran he ki pard-likh kar aatmanirbhar hoti mahilaayein or unki manmarjee se hone vaali shaadiyaan hameshaa se inaki aankh kaa kaanta rahi hai
 Khap panchayats say that all the people born in a gotra are children of the same primitive man, hence consensual marriage is considered taboo in Hinduism
 lekin agar gaharaai se dekhen, to khap panchayaton ke is daawey main dam nahin he
 The proof of this has been given by the Bombay High Court in 1950
 us dauraan ucch nyaayalay main shri harilaal kaniya or shri gajendragadakar kii do sadasyeey peeth ne apane charchit faisle main kaha tha ki sagotra hindu vivaah vaid he
 In their judgment, the judges said that there is so much contradiction in the Puranas, Smriti and Sutras related to gotra that it is impossible to draw a definite conclusion from them
 is sambandh main jajon kii do sadasyeey peeth ne hindu dharamshastra ke prashchaat vidwaan pi0ve0 kane or bhartiya samskruti ke marmajna maxmooler ke saath manu or yajyavlky ke granthon kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 It is clear from this that the demand for declaring marriage as illegal in the same gotra of Khap Panchayats has no merit
 pehle to khap panchayaton ne apni maang ke samarthan main pracheen parampara kii duhai detii rahi hai, lekin jabase unka vaada kamjor pad gaya he, ab ve is sambandh main vaigyanik kaarnon ko ginane lagi hai
 He says that there is a possibility of many genetic diseases by marrying in a gotra
 anuvaanshik vigyaan ke anusaar inbreading yaa ek samooh main shaadi karne se hanikaarak jeenon ke viksit hone kii sambhaavnaayen zyada hoti he, jisase aane vaali santanon main kai prakaar ke rog punap sakate hai
 But if this opinion is given a more broad form, then there are chances of getting married even in a caste or sub-caste
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jis prakaar hindu samaaj main ek gotra ke log ek pita ke vanshaj bataae gayi hai, thik usee prakaar ek jati athwa upjati ke log bhi ek adipurush kii santan maane gayi hai
 According to this, inter-caste marriages and inter-religious marriages are more appropriate
 lekin khap panchayatein atarjaatiy vivaah or antardharmik vivaah kii bhi ghor virdohi hai
 Thus it is clear that Khap Panchayats have no reason to argue that concurrent marriage should be banned
 unki yah maang puraatanapanthi maansikta kii parichaayak he, jo nariwadi utthan or apane aseemit adhikaron ko milane vaali chunautiyon se pareshaan he
 That is why she is introducing such medieval mentality
 jaahir si baat he ki is tarah kii maansikta ko jaij tehraana kisi bhi drushtikon se uchit nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Abhimanyu Singh Tomar This is the next Jat to fight against the Khap Panchayat who does not know with whom his sister or daughter will run away
 This is a battle of the races
 khap System prevailing in Jats only and this is the reason why our “nasal” is best in the world
 angrejo ne jat regiment kyon banaai thi kyon nahin unhone chamaar or chuda regiment banaai kya vaje he jab kargil main har regiment fail ho gayi thi to phir jat regiment ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 And the Jats had spread the country's flag on Kargil
 aaj yahi puraa desh or media hamaari jati ke khilaaf dushparchaar kar rahe he kyon? yah gotra system hamaari parampara he or iskaa ek scientific reason he
 Our Jat breed is still the best Nasal in the world
 khap panchayat pehali baar maharaja harshavardhan ke kal main 643 isvi main astitv main ai
 In ancient times, the person of Muzaffar Nagar district of western Uttar Pradesh used to be the general secretary of this panchayat
 gulaami ke samay main bhi sabase bady khap panchayat mujffarnagar kii hi hua karti thi
 Sarvakhap originated with the Khap Panchayats of Western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana
 khap panchayaton ne desh main kai bady panchayatein kii hai or samaaj tathaa desh ke hit main mahatvapurn nirnay liye hai
 These panchayats issued decrees like taking dowry and giving givers out of the fraternity and bringing small processions and also decided social interests like abolition of jewelry and purdah
 yuddh ke samay main bhi khap panchayaton ne deshbhakti kii misaal kaayam kii he or pracheen kaal main yuddh ke dauraan raajaaon or baadshahon kii madad kii he
 By the way, in the country, there is an old tradition of killing in the name of family honor
 haryana
 punjab
 rajasthan or pashchimi uttar pradesh inamen sabase aage hai
 Boys in most cases of honor killing
 The same tribe of girls
 Marriage in India has been a reason
 antarjaateey prem vivaah is aparaadh kii duusari vajah rahi
 From a scientific point of view, there is a possibility of the birth of an offspring marred in a gotra, but this does not give the panchayats the right to force the lover couple so much that they are forced to commit suicide or The society kills them in the name of honor
 samvedansheel saamaajik mudda hone ke kaaran sarkaar in maamalon main hastkshep karne se kataraati rahi he
 But now Khap Panchayats also feel the need of law in this context
 isiilie ve raajnneetik dalon par dabaav banaakar sarkaar se guzarish kar rahi hai ki vah is sandarbh main kanoon main badlaav laae
 However, there is a need with the law that society should change its mindset and prevent crimes like feticide, one of the reasons responsible for honor killing
 Due to which the sex ratio is decreasing in these areas
 sarv paal khap main 22 gaanv hai
 It is a large organization extending from Faridabad, Ballabgarh to Umbrella, Kosi in Mathura district
 isamen kareeb 1000 gaanv hai
 This khape includes Dinde Pal of Kosi, Gathauna Pal of Bathain, Beniwal Pal of Kamar, Saurot Pal of Hodal, Mundar Pal of Dhatir Allika, Teotia Pal of Januli, Rawat Pal of Paigaon etc
 yah paal dahez nivaaran main sabase aage he
 Khap or Sarvakhap is a system of social administration that has been practiced in the North Western regions of India, such as Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh since time immemorial
 iske anuroop anya prachlit sansthaaen hai paal, gana, gansangh, sabha, samiti, janapad athwa ganatantr
 In order to maintain social order in the society, those who work arbitrarily or those who do anti-social work need to be controlled, if they do not do this then the established beliefs, beliefs, traditions and dignities will end and the forest rule is established
 will go
 manu ne samaaj par niyantran ke liye ek vyavastha di
 In this system, the head of the family has been accepted as the supreme judge
 jisaki sahaayta se prabud vyaktiyon kii ek panchayat hoti thi
 This justice system is still in practice in Jat society
 isi adhaar par baad main gram panchayat kaa janm hua
 When many villages come together to form a relationship of mutual transaction and begin to associate with each other in happiness and sorrow, then these villages come together to form a new community called Jatand in Jatu language
 yadi koi masalaa gaanv-samaaj se na sulajhe tab sthaneey choudhary athwa prabud vyakti gavahand ko ikaitha kar unke saamne us masale ko rakhaa jaataa he
 In the prevailing language it is called the Wakandand Panchayat
 gavahand panchayat main sabhi sambandhit logon se puch tachh kar gahan vichaar vimarsh ke pashchaat samasya kaa hal sunaaya jaataa he jise sarvasammati se maan liya jaataa he
 When a problem is born, the first concerned family tries to solve it
 yadi parivaar ke mukhiya kaa faisla nahin mana jaataa he to is samasya ko samudaay or gram samaaj kii panchayat main laayaa jaataa he
 If the guilty person does not accept the decision of the panchayat, the gram panchayat directs him to stop the hookah, water, village society, transaction etc
 yadi samasya gotra se judy ho to gotra panchayat hoti he jiske madhyam se doshi ko gheraa jaataa he
 The social justice system attempts to give the guilty a new life
 lambe anubhav ke aadhaar par hamaare purvajon ne is saamaajik nyaay vyavastha ko janm diya he jiske anek str hai
 When the panchayats of Gotra and Wakandand also cannot solve any problem, an attempt is made to mobilize people from a large area which includes many Wakandandi areas, several tribal areas and almost all Hindu caste organizations
 is vistrut kshetra ko khap kaa naam diy jaataa he
 Sometimes it is also known as Pal
 gavahandi kaa kshetra 5-7 kii
 m Is limited to a few or a few selected villages
 jabaki paal yaa khap kaa kshetra aseemit hota he
 The villages of every khap are fixed, such as 12 villages of Barwasani Barh, 17 villages of Karala Seventeen, 5 villages of Chauhan Khap, 84 villages of Tomar Khap, 40 villages of Dahiya Chalisa, 365 villages of Palam Khap, 24 villages of Mitrol Khap e

 khap shabd kaa vishleshan karen to ham dekhte hai ki khap do shabdon se milakar bana he
 These words are 'b' and 'you'
 b means the sky and you mean water, an organization that is paramount like the sky and clean, serene like water and available to all, ie justified
 ab khap ek aisa sanghathan mana jaataa he jisamen kuch gaanv shaamil hon, kai gotra ke log shaamil hon yaa ek hi gotra ke log shaamil hon
 They do not have to be in the same area
 ek khap ke gaanv dur-dur bhi ho sakate hai
 Out of the big khapas, many small khapas have also taken birth
 khap ke gaanv ek khap se duusari khap main jane ko swatantra hote hai
 That is why the appearance of Khap has changed over time
 aaj jaaton kii kareeb 3500 khap astitv main hai
 There are 22 villages in Sarva Pal Khap
 yah faridabad, ballabhagarh se lekar mathura jile ke chaataa, kosi tak failaa ek vishaal sanghathan he
 It has about 1000 villages
 is khap main kosi kii dinde paal, bathain kii gathuna paal, kaamar kii beniwal paal, hodal kii sourot paal, datir allika kii munder paal, janauli kii tevatiya paal, paigaanv kii ravat paal aadi sammilit hai
 This pal is at the forefront of dowry prevention
 sarvakhap main ve sabhi khap aati hai jo astitv main hai
 In the face of great crisis on society, country and caste, intellectuals of various Khapas call for Sarvakhap Panchayat
 nihsandesh paal or khap main antar karnaa kaaphi kathin he
 In simple terms, it can be said that a sail is a small organization whereas a khap can consist of many small sails
 khap or paal paryaay vaachi maane jaaen to adhik tarksangat hoga
 The organization of a single gotra can be a pal, while the khap consists of several gotra organizations and several castes
 aisa bhi dekhne main aayaa he ki kuch gotra or gaanv kai khap main shaamil hote hai
 Jat organizations are completely independent, and they come and go as they wish
 chunki ye sanghathan nyaay praapt karne or anyaay ke viruddh sangharsh karne ke liye logon ko ekajute karte hai atah jahaan jis gotra, gaanv, paal ko adhik vishwaas hota he ve vahin sammilit ho sakate hai

 sarvakhap panchayat jat jati kii sarvocch panchayat vyavastha he
 All the known Pal, Khap participate in it
 jab jati, samaaj, raashtra athwa jatigat sanskaron, paramparaon kaa astitv khatre main pad jaataa he athwa kisi samasya kaa samaadhaan kisi anya sanghathan dwaara nahin hota tab sarvakhap panchayat kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he jiske faislon kaa maananaa or disha nirdeshaanusaar kaary karnaa jaruri hota he
 The Sarvakhap system is as old as the Jat caste itself
 samay-samay par iskaa aakar, kaaryastylee or aayojan paristhitiyaan to avashya badalati rahi hai parantu is vyavastha ko attai muslim, angrej or loktantrik pranali bhi samaapt nahin kar saki
 The governing system of the ancient republics was based on the Sarvakhap method
 shivaji ke aavan par kii panchayat sena ne raja daksh kaa sar kaat daalaa tha
 Maharaja Shiva's capital was in Kankhal
 ek baar daksh ne yajna kiya tha jisamen shiv ko chhodkar sabhi raajaaon ko bulaayaa tha
 Parvati reached there without being called
 Shiva was insulted there
 yah apmaan parvati se sahan nahin hua or vah havankund main kud kar sati ho gai
 When Shiva came to know, he was very angry
 shiv ne virbhadra ko bulaayaa or kaha ki meri gana sena kaa netritv karo or daksh kaa yajna nasht kar do
 Virabhadra went with Shiva's ganas and cut off Daksha's head by destroying the yajna
 sarv khap panchayat or uske ganon kii yah sabase puraani ghatana he
 In the Ramayana period, the historian called the Vanar Sena was the panchayat army of Sarvakhap headed by Veer Hanuman and whose chief advisor was a Veer named Jamwant
 ram or lakshman kii vyathaa sunakar hanuman or sugriv ne sarv khap panchayat bulaai thi jisamen lanka par chadhai karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Various castes and Khapas took part in that Sarva Khap, the then Bhil, Kol, Kirat, Vanar, Reich, Bal, Raghuvanshi, Sen, Jatayu etc
 vaanron kii bahutayat ke kaaran yah vanar sena kahalaai
 This panchayat was presided over by Maharaja Sugriva
 mahabharat kaal main sarvakhap panchayat ne dharm kaa saath diya tha
 In the Mahabharata period, the then Maharaja Shri Krishna was the head of the then panchayat or head of the ganas
 shrikrishna ne kai baar panchayatein kii
 To stop the war, sent Sanjay to the Kauravas from Sarva Khap Panchayat, himself went to Hastinapur Kauravas to convince them to give only 5 villages as per the panchayat decision
 shakuni, karn or duryodhana ne panchayat ke faisle ko taak par rakh kar elaan kiya ki sui kii nonk ke baraabar bhi jagah nahin di jaayegi
 This ended in the Mahabharata war
 The Mahabharata had terrible results
 saamaajik saranchana chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Kshatriyas did not remain to rule
 mahabharat kaal main bharat main araajaktaa kaa vyapak prabhaav tha
 He has crossed the ultimate limit
 uttari bharat main samrajyavaadee shaskaon ne praja ko asay vipadaa main daal rakhaa tha
 Seeing this situation, Krishna, with the help of Agaraj Balarama, appointed Kamsa, who was the ruler of Mathura, to cut off Kamsa
 krishna ne samrajyavaadee shaskaon se sangharsh karne hetu ek sangh kaa nirmaan kiya
 At that time there were many clans of Yadavas, but first of all they formed the union of the blind, the feast and the Vrishni clans
 sangh ke sadsy aapas main sambandhi hote the isi kaaran us sangh kaa naam ‘gyaati-sangh’ rakhaa gaya
 This Sangh was not a head man

 He was known only as Gyati
 pracheen grantho ke adhyayan se yah baat saaf ho jaati he ki paristhiti or bhashaa ke badalte rup ke kaaran ‘gyaat’ shabd ne ‘jat’ shabd kaa rup dhaaran kar liya
 Thakur Deshraj writes that in the Mahabharata period Gana has been used as a union

 Chapter 108 of the Shanti Parva of Mahabharata in relation to the ganas is given in detail
 isamen yudhisthir poochhate hai bhishma se ki ganon ke sambandh main aap mujhe yah bataane kii krupa karen ki ve kis tarah vardhit hote hai, kis prakaar shatru kii bhed-niti se bachate hai, shatruon par kis tarah vijay praapt karte hai, kis tarah mitra banaate hai, kis tarah gupt mantron ko chhupate hai
 This makes it clear that the Gana and Sangha of the Mahabharata period were actually the forms of the current khap and sarvakhap

 jab jati, samaaj, raashtra athwa jatigat sanskaron, paramparaon kaa astitv khatre main pad jaataa he athwa kisi samasya kaa samaadhaan kisi anya sanghathan dwaara nahin hota tab sarvakhap panchayat kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he jiske faislon kaa maananaa or disha nirdeshaanusaar kaary karnaa jaruri hota he
 The Sarvakhap system is as old as the Jat caste itself
 samay-samay par iskaa aakaar, kaaryastylee or aayojan paristhitiyaan to avashya badalati rahi hai parantu is vyavastha ko attai muslim, angrej or loktantrik pranali bhi samaapt nahin kar saki
 The governing system of the ancient republics was based on the Sarvakhap method
 shivaji ke aavan par hi panchayat sena ne raja daksh kaa sar kaat daalaa tha
 Maharaja Shiva's capital was in Kankhal
 ek baar daksh ne yajna kiya tha jisamen shiv ko chhodkar sabhi raajaaon ko bulaayaa tha
 Sati reached there without being called
 Shiva was insulted there
 yah apmaan sati se sahan nahin hua or swayan ko yogagni main bhasma kar diya tha
 
 When Shiva came to know, he was very angry
 shiv ne virbhadra ko bulaayaa or kaha ki meri gana sena kaa netritv karo or daksh kaa yajna nasht kar do
 Virabhadra went with Shiva's ganas and cut off Daksha's head by destroying the yajna
 sarv khap panchayat or uske ganon kii yah sabase puraani ghatana he
 In the Ramayana period, the historian called the Vanar Sena was the panchayat army of Sarvakhap headed by Hanuman, whose chief advisor was a hero named Jamwant
 ram or lakshman kii vyathaa sunakar hanuman or sugriv ne sarv khap panchayat bulaai thi jisamen lanka par chadhai karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Various castes and Khapas took part in that Sarva Khap, the then Bhil, Kol, Kirat, Vanar, Reich, Bal, Raghuvanshi, Sen, Jatayu etc
 vaanron kii bahutayat ke kaaran yah vanar sena kahalaai
 This panchayat was presided over by Maharaja Sugriva
 mahabharat kaal main sarvakhap panchayat ne dharm kaa saath diya tha
 In the Mahabharata period, the then Maharaja Shri Krishna was the head of the then panchayat or head of the ganas
 shrikrishna ne kai baar panchayatein kii
 Sarva Khap panchayat to stop the war and sent Sanjay to the Kauravas, himself went to Hastinapur Kauravas to convince them to give only 5 villages as per the panchayat decision
 shakuni, karn or duryodhana ne panchayat ke faisle ko taak par rakh kar elaan kiya ki sui kii nonk ke baraabar bhi jagah nahin di jaayegi
 This ended in the Mahabharata war
 The Mahabharata had terrible results
 saamaajik saranchana chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Kshatriyas did not remain to rule
 mahabharat kaal main bharat main araajaktaa kaa vyapak prabhaav tha
 He has crossed the ultimate limit
 uttari bharat main samrajyavaadee shaskaon ne praja ko asay vipadaa main daal rakhaa tha
 Seeing this situation, Krishna ended Kamsa with the help of Agraj Balarama and appointed Ugrasena as the ruler of Mathura
 krishna ne samrajyavaadee shaskaon se sangharsh karne hetu ek sangh kaa nirmaan kiya
 At that time there were many clans of Yadavas, but first of all they formed the union of the blind, the feast and the Vrishni clans
 sangh ke sadsy aapas main sambandhi hote the isi kaaran us sangh kaa naam 'gyaati-sangh' rakhaa gaya
 
 This Sangh was not a head man
 isamen shaamil hote hi kisi rajkul kaa purv naam aadi sab samaapt ho jate the
 He was known only as Gyati
 pracheen grantho ke adhyayan se yah baat saaf ho jaati he ki paristhiti or bhashaa ke badalte rup ke kaaran 'gyaat' shabd ne 'jat' shabd kaa rup dhaaran kar liya
 Thakur Deshraj writes that in the Mahabharata period Gana has been used as a union
 buddha ke samay bharatvarsh main 116 prajatantr the
 Chapter 108 of the Shanti Parva of Mahabharata in relation to the ganas is given in detail
 isamen yudhisthir poochhate hai bhishma se ki ganon ke sambandh main aap mujhe yah bataane kii krupa karen ki ve kis tarah vardhit hote hai, kis prakaar shatru kii bhed-niti se bachate hai, shatruon par kis tarah vijay praapt karte hai, kis tarah mitra banaate hai, kis tarah gupt mantron ko chhupate hai
 This makes it clear that the Gana and Sangha of the Mahabharata period were actually the forms of the current khap and sarvakhap
 ‘dharana-prakaran’, ‘vedapal-’hatyakand’, ‘balhamba-hatyakand’, ‘sivaana hatyakand’ aadi ek ke baad ek kanoon kii dhajjiyaan udaane vaali ghatnaon ne haryana kii khap panchayaton ke vibhats hote swaroop, swarthpurna raajnneetikon kii ‘votniti’ or bebas kanoonee sipaahiyon ke bandhe haathon ne 21veen sadi ke prabud samaaj or 63waan swatantraaa diwas manaane vaale vi’va ke sabase bade loktantric desh ko gahan chintan karne ke liye vivash kar diya he
 This is the result of mutual ideological and ideological confrontations of the dictatorship of the Khap Panchayats of the society, which are considered paramount by the modern youth generation and law and justice system, breaking the taboo
 sarvakhap panchayaton kii lalaphitaashahee or use khooni, asabhy va gaiyr-kanoonee ‘tughluqi farmaanon’ evam ‘fatvon’ ko dekhte hue yah kadaapi nahin kaha ja saktaa ki hamane swatantraaa ke chah dashak paar kar liye hai or ham 21veen sadi ke loktantric desh va susabhy samaaj ke naagarik hai
 It is not easily believed that an innocent and innocent person succumbs to the narrow, frenzied and barbaric thinking of some self-styled contractors
 kisi kii jaghanya hatya kar di jaati he or kisi ko uske moulik adhikaron se vanchit karke khanaabadosh jindagi jeene ke liye vivash kar diya jaataa he or hamaara prajatantric kanoon mook-darshak va asahaay khadaa najar aata he
 For centuries, Jagran campaigns have been going on in our country to eradicate all the discrimination like caste, caste, religion, untouchability, high and low
 in sab saamaajik vikrutiyon se to ham nijaat hasil nahin kar paae, lekin ‘gotra-vivaad’ naamak ek or samasya ke shikaar ho gaye
 a clear demand has emerged from the Sarvakhap Panchayats that they consider the girl from the village and the Gutra of Guhand as their daughter, hence cannot accept her as a daughter-in-law
 kuch buddhijivi log apni is hajaaron varsh puraani parampara, reeti-rivaaj evam sanskaar ko jivant banaae rakhane evam kanoonee manyata praapt karne ke liye sanvaidhanik niyamon ke tahat ‘hindu vivaah adhinium’ main sanshodhan karwaane kii raah par aage badhane ke liye ekajute ho rahe hai, joki swaagat yogya he
 To follow the constitutional path would be a commendable step, and to unconstitutionally display your bravado and sarcasm illegally, to pronounce base-foot verdicts is absolutely wrong, absurd and a mere Tughlaq decrees or fatwa
 kuch unmaadi log media jagat ko ‘nausikhie’ or ‘bevakoof’ bataakar apane gaal bajaate hai, kya unhone kabhi aatm-manthan kiya he? kya unhe ‘khap’ athwa ‘sarvakhap’ kii vaastavik paribhaasha, siddhanton, mulyon evam dhyeyon kaa bhi gyaan he? ‘sarvakhap’ kii paribhaasha ke anusaar ‘aisa saamaajik sanghathan jo akaash kii tarah sarvopari ho or pani kii tarah svachh, nirmal evam sabake liye uplabdh arthath nyaayakari ho
 'have the frenzied contractors of society ever thought that they have gone so far away from the basic principles of' Sarvakhap 'in the name of Chaudhar's arrogance and the question of nose and mustaches? The subject of the biggest surprise is that most of the people who do not have any importance in their home are sitting outside as Panchayati
 haalanki khap panchayaton main chand bujurg evam vidwaan log aise bache hue hai, jinka samaaj main puraa maan-sammaan he, lekin unki aajkal koi ahmiyat hi nahin maan rahaa he
 They have to meet yes under the pressure of crazy and antisocial elements
 isi ke parinaswaroop aaj khap panchayaton par gaharaa pra’nachinh uth khadaa hua he
 Today, the day-to-day difference in functioning and functioning of panchayats, gotra panchayats, khap panchayats and sarvakhap panchayats has come
 pehle panchayatein jodne kaa kaam karti thim, aaj panchayatein todane kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 Earlier all efforts were made to settle the people, today desolation is done
 pehle vyakti kii jaan, maal, sampatti, sammaan aadi har tarah kii suraksha kii jaati thi, lekin aaj kisi tarah kii koi parvaah hi nahin kii jaati
 Earlier khap panchayats used to take historical decisions against social problems and evils and helped the law by resolving every dispute objectively and universally on its own
 lekin aaj ye sab khap panchayatein vivaah-shaadiyon ke ‘gotra’ sambamdhi maamalon main ulajhakar kendrit si ho gai hai or kanoon ko thenga dikhaane va use apane haath main lene ke ke liye gaiyr-kanoonee va tughluqi farmaan sunaane ko aatur hui dikhaai detii hai
 Earlier, in Khap Panchayats, elders used to give fair judgment with great peace, patience, restraint and amity, today those same Panchayats are judged on the lines of 'whose lathi is his buffalo' and Panchayati Numinde Basir on the emphasis of insane and anti-social elements
 - Decides on foot
 aaj jab bhi koi prabud vyakti in tathakthith samaaj sudhaarak khap panchayaton ko vaastavik aainaa dikhaane kii koshish bhar karata he athwa loktantric desh main kanoon ke sammaan ke liye kalam chalaata he to samast khap panchayaton kii bhauhen tan jaati hai
 The alleged representatives of the khap-panchayats start abusing the intellectuals, journalists and Kalamkars who have learned the law from the public forums and start doing unrestrained abuses
 isi durbhaavna ke chalate hi loktantr ke chauthe stambh par kisi na kisi rup main hamale kiye jate hai or apni bhadaas nikaali jaati he
 Only on the historical forums decorated by the Sarvakhapas, the evil of public morality, justice, principles, values, culture and rituals is badly flushed and the law and administration remains silent spectators and can do nothing except shed tears of helplessness

 Every extreme has an end
 sarvakhap panchayaton ke vibhats hote swaroop ko dekhakar lagata he ki sambhavat: hajaaron varsh puraani khap parampara apane charam par pahunch chuki he
 Today's new generation has adopted a rebellious attitude against its own old generation

 Law and enlightened class have also come out in favor of this initiative of modern youth generation

 If all the representatives of the Supreme Council are 'self-churning' in their discretion, converged, fair, humane, constitutional and democratic, then they will automatically come to know that certainly the Khap Panchayats symbolize our social unity, harmony, brotherhood and cultural values
 Somewhere have failed to retain and due to which fingers are lifting on them
 khap panchayaton main unmaadi, ahamkaari, na’di, alpbuddhi, sankeern evam hinsak pravriti vaale vyaktiyon kii adhik sankhya main ghusepaith ho gai or bujurg evam buddhijivi logon kii nirantar kami hoti chali gai
 Due to this, the Khap panchayats were heard one after another by illegitimate, double-handed, blood-footed, terror-ridden verdicts and fatwas and the Sarvakhap panchayats became infamous
 kul milakar khap panchayaton ko is samay gahan aatm-manthan karne va samay kii maang ko sahaj va saharsha sweekaar karte hue sanvaidhanik dagar par chalane kii kadi aavashyaktaa he
 For Sarvakhap Panchayats to take timely historical decisions, to reveal their liberal and social image, to repose faith in democracy and law, unrestrained babbling of khap-panchayats in future, banning Tughlaq Fatwas and decisions, frenzied and anti-social elements By establishing strong restrictions, establishing the latest values of social harmony to prove their selfishness under the guise of Khap Panchayats , Declaring to run a social campaign against social evils and stereotypes and establishing human values, to find an easy and universally resolved solution to future gotra-disputes and killings in the name of 'honor', lifelong village deportations and other non - Urgent need to take important initiatives to agree on issues like taking strong steps to curb illegal activities etc

 If Khap panchayats could not succeed in doing this, it would be a matter of great misfortune for them
 kyonki ab wo samay aa gaya he, jab khap panchayaton ko bhi har haalat main samyanuroop badalanaa hi padegaa
 If it does not change by itself, then surely the time cycle of 'time' will change them by itself

 In 1696, the Panchayati Army once again faced the imperial army

 Maharaja Harshavardhana organized a huge conference in Kannauj city to unite the Jat Kshatriyas in 643, it was the Sarvakhap Panchayat which was named as 'haryana Sarvakhap Panchayat', because in those days the vast Haryana reached the Sutlej River in the north, Dehradun in the east, It was spread as far as Bareilly, Mainpuri and Terai areas, Chambal river in the south and Ganganagar in the west

 In a fierce battle, Mohna Jat attacked Abdullah on the ground and beat him to the ground

 isamen jat veeron ne apane paramparaagat hathiyaaron yatha lathi, ballam, kulhadi, gandasi, bhaalaa, barchhi, jeli, kataar aadi se antim dam tak shahi sainikon ko katl kiya
 The war went on for several days and most of the Mall warriors including Jatwan were martyred
 Aibak won but says he cried in a roar after seeing the bodies of half his army and crying, he said that i would have known that Jats are so many fighters, they would not have fought with them even after forgetting them, by taking the warriors like Jatwan with them i could win the whole earth

 It is clear that in the 13th century, the Sarvakhap panchayats were in such a situation that they would get the government to agree
 The panchayat army was also so powerful that it defeated the imperial army several times

 Sarvakhap Panchayat assisted on the condition that on sitting on the throne, he would accept all the demands of Sarvakhap
 Humayun defeated Sikandarshah Suri, the successor of Sher Shah Suri, with the help of the Khap Panchayat in the battle of Sirhind, and regained Delhi and died some time later
