 faujee kanoon kaa arth ek ore to shasnadhikariyon kii yah sweekaarokti hoti he ki desh yaa kshetravishesh main aisi sthiti utpann ho gai he jab takat kaa saamana takat se karnaa aavashyak he, at: unke haath main aise asaamaanya adhikaar hone chahie jinka upyog sankat kaal kii avadhi tak desh ke aantarik anchal main kiya ja sake, is sthit main nyaayalayon kii prakriya ke sthaan par karypalika athwa sainik prashaasak ke adeshon ko hi sarvaadhik manyata praapt ho jaati he
 On the other hand, military law is the idea of a legal suffix, whereby the civil courts have tried to control the extraordinary rights which are acquired by the executive to apply to the citizens of the state
 is prakaar faujee kanoon, sainik kanoon se, jo sashastr saindal ke niyantran kaa vishesh kanoon hota he, bhinn he
 When the armed forces are used for the exercise of civil rights, then the army does its work under the control of civil authorities and the criminals are considered in ordinary courts

 In England, the emperor does not have the right to declare a crisis, but at the time of war, the executive has the right to disseminate several arrangements and orders under parliamentary legislation and corresponding acts

 In American law, to what extent the President has the right to declare military law, independent of congressional action, and how much control can be exercised by the legislature and the courts in that situation, it is still a matter of dispute and the legal situation in this case is now Is also unclear
 bharat main bhi spasht sanvaidhanik nirdesh ke abhaav main yah vivaadaaspad he ki faujee kanoon kii ghoshnaa kaa adhikari koun he
 The reference to military law is only in the 34th section, which provides for the Compensation Act after the military law is lifted in a particular area
 kintu faujee kanoon se miltaa julata hi dhara 359 ke antargat raashtrapati kaa vah adhikaar hota he jisase vah dhara 21 or 22 ke antargat adhikaron kaa nyaayik nishpaadan sthagit kar de saktaa he
 It is understood that this is basically a form of military law, but it appears that the Supreme Court has left it for dispute, whatever may be adopted in this regard, under Section 352 of the Constitution of the crisis
 The effect of the Declaration on Fundamental Rights is at the same level as that of military law
 is prakaar dhara 358 ke antargat jab tak sankatkalin sthiti kaayam rahati he, karypalika ko dhara 19 kii vyavasthaaon ke ulanghan kaa adhikaar rahata he
 Other fundamental rights may also be suspended by the President for a period of crisis under Section 359 or for the period mentioned in the order
 raashtrapati ke adhikaar par keval itnaa hi niyantran hota he ki sankatkaal kii ghoshnaa sweekruti ke liye sansad ke samaksh prastut kii jaani chahie
 There is no fixed period for presenting this declaration before the Parliament and there is no provision for any penalty if it is not presented, but it ends automatically after two months of the declaration being aired
 ek ghoshnaa ke samaapt hone par phir duusari ghoshnaa jari karne main raashtrapati par koi pratibandh nahin he
 The President's order issued under section 359 should be presented to the Parliament at the earliest
 is prastutikaran ke samay kaa nirnay karnaa karypalika par chhod diya gaya he kyonki yadi raashtrapati kaa aadesh sansad ke samaksh prastut nahin kiya jaataa to bhi iskaa prabhaav kam nahin hota or na hi prastut karne ke abhaav main koi vaidhanik karrwai kii vyavastha he
 During the 1962 Chinese invasion, the President declared a crisis situation by postponing the execution of sections 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution
 halaat bahut kuch saamaanya ho jane ke baad bhi ghoshnaa ko radd karne main atyadhik vilamb kiye jane par saarvajanik rup se badi aalochana hui thi
 This fact has necessitated the imposition of some further protection in relation to the rights of the crisis, because if it is not so, any unwary officer can abolish the constitution for his convenience and make the military law permanent

 is patent kaa prachaar dhwani mail ke liye agrani patent ke rup main kiya gaya tha
 Shortly after the development of the first voicemail systems, companies such as Wang Laboratories, ROLM, Opcom, Octel, Centigram, Genesis, and many others arose to develop their own systems
 Under the leadership of Dr
 Larry Bergeron, Wang Laboratories developed a voicemail system based on the IBM system
 vaing ne apni pranali ko diviex kaa naam diya
 It also could not answer calls from outside, but was smaller and less expensive than the IBM system
 maitheus ne apane patent kaa kaaphi chaturaai se prayog kiya
 It tried to claim its patents with IBM, AT&T and then Wang, but all three companies were reportedly able to invalidate Matthews' patents based on prior art
 maitheus ne chaturaai se ek samjhauta hasil kiya jisase uskaa patent adaalat main chunauti ke bina barkaraar rahaa or ibiem, vaing or anti and tii ne sabhi viemex patenton ke roylty-mukt license praapt kar liye
 vaing, jo aisa license arjeet karne vaali antim badi company thi, ne anivaary rup se 2 xxrep 4 0 dollar kaa bhugtan kiya or kuch patent aavednon ko cross-license kar liya
 IBM and AT&T also cross-licensed many patents to VMX, most of which were obsolete or out of date
 viemex ko yah daawa karne kaa mauka mil gaya ki kai badi companiyon ne uske patent kaa license liya tha, lekin usne kuch na lene kii baat nahin bataai
 patent ko adaalat main kabhi chunauti nahin di gai or viemex ne is baat kaa daawa karnaa jari rakhaa ki usne dhwani mail kaa avishkaar kiya tha or maitheus dhwani mail kaa pita tha
 After the agreement with Wang, VMX entered into an agreement with Octel
 ek chote bhugtan or ocktail dwaara yah sahmati diye jane ki vah viemex ke kisi patent ke liye mukadmaa nahin karegaa, ke badale main ocktail ko sabhi vartmaan or bhavishya ke viemex patenton ke liye ek pehle se bhugtan kiya hua roylty-mukt license mil gaya
 ROLM was the first company to offer integrated voicemail through a product called its phonemail, which is a registered trademark
 phonmel ne apane digital sandeshon kii prabhaavshaalee recording gunvattta kii peshkash kii
 aroelem kaa digital pibiex pehla pibiex tha jo is baat kaa sanket de saktaa tha ki dhwani mail pranali ko koun sa ekstansion bheja ja rahaa he
 However, the signaling function was proprietary and was intended only for use by its voicemail product, phonemail
 aroelem kaa sibiex bhi aroelem ke electranik phonon or baad main pratiksha kar rahe sandesh kii battiyon se las maanak phonon par, pratiksha kar rahe sandesh kii batti ko jalaane ke liye phonmel ko sakasham karne hetu sanketan kriya kii suvidha detaa tha 
 phonmel aroelem ke sibikson ke sabhi to nahin, lekin adhikansh maadlon or pibiexon ke anya brandon jaise nortel ke opshan meridian ke saath kaam karata tha or aroelem dwaara vyapak rup se prachaarit tha
 phonemail is still a commercial success
 cemens abhi bhi phonmel or uske ekikrut sandeshwahi uttaradhikari, exprations 470 ko vibhinn vinyason / aakaaron main prastut karata he; vah bhi usee aakarshak nari swar ke saath jise aroelem ke takaneekagyon ne pyaar se “silicon saili” kaa upnaam diya he
 Opcom, another company started by David Ladd, was another manufacturer of voicemail that built and patented the automated attendant facility
 Automatic attendant is not technically voicemail, but all features are already part of a voicemail system to enable automatic attendant, making it a natural feature to add to it
 opcom patenton ke baavjood, swachaalit parichar suvidhaon ko 1985 se pehle ek vanijyik terradine utpaada main lagu kiya gaya tha
 Opcom has developed a voicemail system primarily for marketing to small enterprises
 swachaalit parichar ekal ank kunjee kaa upyog karke use sidhe kol karne ke liye sakasham banaata he
 For example, "if you're making a domestic reservation, press '1'; press '2' for international reservations; press '3' for information on frequent fliers, etc
"
 Opcom was an innovative company and also invented the concept of Unified Messaging
 Opcom's voicemail product was a commercial success with smaller companies and some larger companies
 Around 1991, VMX was on the verge of bankruptcy and was acquired by Opcom
 chuki opcom nijee or viemex saarvajanik sampada the, isaliye lenden ek ulte vilay ke rup main kiya gaya tha or shesh bachi company kaa naam viemex rakhaa gaya
 Only a small part of the original VMX company remained
 octel sanchaar nigam kii sthapana 1982 main silicon vaili main bob kohn or peter olsan dwaara kii gai
 Octel's voicemail system occupied a large share of the market fairly quickly
 jabaki octel ko dusron kii mehnat or prayogon se laabh hua, vah pehali swatantra dhwani mail company thi jisane is mahatvapurn bazaar par vijay paane ke liye ek majboot vyapaar or ranneeti kaa nirmaan kiya
 In addition, Octel invented quite innovative technologies that contributed heavily to its success
 Octel's differentiated hardware and software architecture makes its systems smaller in size, faster, more reliable, and significantly lower cost than other vendors in production
 These features, many of which were patented, gave Octel market leadership: octel kii ranneeti ne pramukh khaaton kii un jaruraton ko puraa kiya jo anya vikritaon ke dhyaan main bahut samay baad bhi nahin ain: unnat prashikshan, graahak seva, bikri or bazaar shiksha
 octel kii pranali uski ore aane vaali kaalon ke ekstansion numberon or adhikansh pibiexon kii sandesh-pratiksha battiyon ko pradipt kar sakati thi
 This was possible because Octel's engineers had engineered major brands of pbxs in the reverse direction and discovered new ways of communicating by pbxs that PBX manufacturers could not
 antatah pibiex ke adhikansh nirmaataaon ne octel ke saath mil kar kaam karne kaa faisla kiya
 Octel integrates with around 100 brands of PBX worldwide
 octel ke vishwavyaapee netritv ke parinamswaroop, uskaa upyogkarta interfes sari duniya main sarvaadhik vikhyath ho gaya
 In the late 1990s, Octel introduced the concept of visual mailboxes and unified messaging
 Visual mailboxes gave users the ability to manage their voice mailboxes through their personal computers, although messages were still stored on the Octel system
 ekikrut sandeshprakriya ne dhwani mail ko microsoft dwaara banaai gai korporate email pranali, microsoft exange ke saath ekikrut kar diya
 The unified messaging was actually invented by Roberta Cohen, Kenneth Huber and Deborah Mill at AT&T Bell Labs
 ekikrut sandeshpranali ke liye patent june 1989 main jari kiya gaya tha
 Unified Messaging: Through Unified Messaging, users could receive voice and email messages on their personal computer using either the graphical user interface, or the telephone user interface with any telephone in the world
 nijee computer par, upyogkarta apane email inbox main dhwanimelon or imelon ko ek saath mishrit rup main dekh sakate the
 Voicemail consisted of a small telephone symbol and a small envelope sign next to the email
 For voicemail, they saw "header information"
 Users could double-click the voicemail from their email inbox and listen to the message through their personal computer or the phone next to their desk
 duniya main kisi bhi phone kaa upyog karke, upyogkarta dhwani sandeshon ko saamaanya tareeke se sun sakate the or saath hi unke imelon ko padhwa sakate the
 Voice messages could be sent using email or phone-related schemes, and data networking infrastructure was used to send messages between locations rather than public telephone switched networks
 ekikrut sandeshprakriya un dinon vyavsaayik rup se safal nahin ho saki thi, kyonki 1990 ke dashak ke uttarardh tak email ko bazaar kaa bada bhaag nahin mila tha
 Email servers were not particularly reliable, Internet connections were slow, and most personal computers did not have speakers or microphones
 1988 tak, telephone companiyon or navgathit cellular phone companiyon ko kanuunan apane graahakon ko dhwani mail kii peshkash karne kii manaahi thi
 This was done by the FCC to protect telephone answering businesses across the country
 yah nishedh 1984 main us aadesh ke saath jari rahaa, jisane anti and tii ko vichchhedit kar diya tha
 The prohibition was lifted following a decision by Harold H
 Green on 7 March 1988
 phone companiyon ko ek seva ke rup main dhwani mail kii peshkash karne kii anumati de di gai, lekin unhen seva pradaan karne vaali mashiinon ko dizin karne yaa unhen banane se varjit kar diya gaya
 The huge VMX system was being used by only a few carriers, but due to serious reliability and cost issues, VMX faced obstacles in expanding the carrier market
 Octel already had very high capacity systems for corporate use, and by 1988 all seven regional Bell operating companies were using Octel for internal use
 octel ne vaahakon ke liye pehle apni sabase badi pranali ko anukulit kiya, jisase unhen apane graahakon ko vishwasaneey dhwani mail pradaan karne kii kshamta praapt ho gai
 Within a year, Octel introduced to the market a new generation of its larger systems, carriers that followed the "NEBS standards", a standard required by phone companies for any device located in their central offices
 Was specially designed for kuch anya nirmaataaon, jinamein unisis, boston praudyogiki or comvars praudyogiki shaamil the, ne vaahakon ke liye dhwani mail bazaar main pravesh kiya
 These vendors did not offer voicemail to corporations, instead focusing on a potentially large and lucrative carrier market
 unisis ne packbel kii awasaiya dhwani mail sevaayen pradaan karne kaa adhikaar praapt kar liya or bel atlantic kii awasaiya dhwani mail kii peshkash kaa mukhya aadhaar boston praadyogiki tha
 None of the other corporate voicemail manufacturers had significant success in the carrier market, as their systems had little capacity and the devices were not sufficiently reliable
 corporate bazaar ko vikray karne kii tulana main vaahakon ko vikray karne ke liye bikri or vipanan ke bhinn tareekon kii aavashyaktaa thi or keval octel hi donon main safal rahaa
 The first carrier to successfully offer voicemail to its customers in North America was probably Bell Cellular, the Canadian carrier serving Ontario and Quebec
 Bell Cellular's success with voicemail gained momentum and cellular voicemail spread throughout Canada and then to the US and overseas
 kuch hi varshon main, canada kii shat-pratishat cellular companiyaan antatah octel dhwani mail kaa prayog karne lageen, jiske baad lagbhag sabhi pramukh america wirelas vaahak or duniya bhar main jiesem vaahakon ke ek bade pratishat ne iskaa prayog shuru kar diya
 comvars praudyogiki america ke baahar jiesem bazaar main bahut safal rahaa
 The Octel user interface became the most common with most carriers worldwide, but each carrier made minor changes to the interface

 Virtual telephony developed by Octel used voicemail to rapidly provide wireless telephone service in emerging countries
 isse ubharate deshon main adhik telephone na hone kii samasya hal ho gai
 Wiring for telephones was very expensive and many poor citizens did not have homes to get wired
 telephone ke liye taron bahut mahangaa he or garib tha kai nagarikon taar karne ke liye gharon main he nahin tha
 The economies of emerging countries were not developing partly because people could not communicate outside the confines of the region where they could only walk or cycle
 unhen phone pradaan karnaa apni arthvyavasthaaon ko sudhaarney kaa ek rasta tha, lekin vahaan yah tarika vyaavhaarik nahin tha
 In some countries, a phone had to wait for many years and it cost up to several thousand dollars
 us samay cellular phone upyukt vikalp nahin the kyonki ve bahut mahange the cell kii citon kii sthapana ke liye aavashyak buniyadi dhaancha bhi mahangaa tha
 With virtual telephony, each person could be given a phone number and a voice mailbox
 naagarik ko ek pager bhi diya saktaa tha
 When someone called at that phone number, his bell would never ring on an actual phone, but was immediately taken to a central voicemail system
 dhwani mail pranali us phone kaa jawaab detii thi or phone karne vaala ek lanbaa, vistrut sandesh chhod saktaa tha
 As soon as the message was received, the voicemail system activated the citizen's pager
 soochna praapt hone par, naagarik kisi bhugtan- phone kii khoj karata tha or sandesh praapt karne ke liye phone karata tha
 This concept was successfully used in South America and South Africa

 IBM and Wang were out of the voicemail market by the late 1990s, as they could not get enough traction
 ROLM was purchased by IBM in the mid-1980s and then sold half of its stake to German company Siemens

 The remaining company was renamed VMX, but VMX was completely wiped out by Opcom, leaving behind its name and patent portfolio
 1994 main, octel ne viemex ko kharid liya
 In the early 90s, AT&T / Lucent created its own version of voicemail for the corporate market, but could only work on AT&T / Lucent's pbxs
 nortel ne meridian mail kaa vikaas kiya or anti and tii ke samaan hi ranneeti kaa paalan kiya jiske anusaar meridian mail keval uttari telecom pibiexon ke saath hi kaam karata tha
 As a result, no company could get any special market share of large national or multinational accounts
 AT&T changed its equipment business to a company called Lucent Technologies, and Northern Telecom changed its name to Nortel

 By 1997, Octel's biggest competitors were Audix produced by Lucent and Meridian Mail manufactured by Nortel
 july 1997 main, octel ko lucent technology dwaara kharid liya gaya
 Lucent's Audix division was merged into Octel to form the Octel Messaging Division

 Within a few years, Comverse became the largest supplier of carriers and Lucent maintained its leadership in the corporate market and stood second with carriers
 By 2000, some estimate that there were over 150,000,000 active users of corporate and carrier voicemail created by the Octel messaging department

 telephone par jawaab dena or dhwani sandesh bhejnaa dhwani mail ke kaam karne ke do mukhya bhaag hai
 The answering part on the telephone answers the incoming call from outside and takes a message from any outside caller
 Voice messaging enables a customer to send messages directly to mailboxes of any or many other customers without calling them first

 One of the benefits of a PBX is its ability to forward calls
 yadi koi vyakti apane phone kaa upyog kar rahaa he, yaa uskaa jawaab nahin detaa he, to uske ekstansion ko ja rahi kaale pibiex dwaara swachaalit rup se kisi bhi anya ekstansion, shaayad aise kisi vyakti ke paas, jo us kol ko jawaab de saktaa he yaa sandesh le saktaa he, aage bhej di jaati hai
 By installing a voicemail system, the PBX is programmed to forward busy or unanswered extensions to a machine-voicemail system
 maan len ki ek bahari collar, vilma, kisi company main kisi fred ko kol karti he
 If Fred's phone rings as "no answer" or "busy", the PBX will forward that call to the voicemail system
 The PBX has to somehow tell the voicemail system that the call is being forwarded to Fred's phone so that the voicemail system can respond with Fred's personal greeting
 Without this information, the voicemail system would have no idea whose phone she was answering
 ek baar ek sandesh chhod dene par, dhwani mail pranali fred ke phone par pratiksha kar rahe sandesh kii batti ko uddipt kar detii he
 She does this by sending a signal to the PBX to let her know which light she wants to light
 jab fred apni mej par lautataa he or dhwani mail pranali ko phone karata he to use keval uske nijee melbox main aae sandesh hi prastut kiye jate hai, bhale hi anya logon se sambandhit hajaaron sandesh usee pranali par sangrahit kyon na hue hon
 sandesh ko ek baar sunaane ke baad, dhwani mail pranali pibiex ko fred ke phone par jal rahi pratiksha kar rahe sandesh kii batti ko band karne kaa sanket detii he
 Early voicemail systems could not respond to external calls - that is, they could not automatically respond to calls sent to an extension of a PBX when they were busy or unanswered
 baad kii dhwani mail pranaaliyon ke vikaas ke saath, pranaaliyon dwaara baahar se aane vaali kaalon kaa jawaab diya janaa sambhav ho gaya he
 However, most pbxs did not indicate to the voicemail system which extensions they were forwarding, nor did they assist by burning the message light waiting on telephones
 yah sanketak kriya bhi baad main uplabdh ho gai, lekin aisa sambhav hone ke pehle kai varshon tak dhwani mail pranaaliyon ke liye yah ek pramukh chunauti thi
 Voice messages are not always required to be sent between individuals located on the same voicemail system
 Messages can be transferred using AMIS or VOIP technologies
 ye donon takneekein ek computer pranali par sandeshon kaa lakshya pranali kii ore agreshit karne detii hai
 Like email, this method of delivering voice messages can be the subject of abuse such as spam or vishing

 This section describes how the original-style, stand-alone voicemail system works with a corporate PBX system
 iskaa siddhanth kendriya karyaalay swichon yaa mobile telephone swichan karyaalay ke jaisaa hi he
 Most modern voicemail systems work on this principle, but parts of it can be shared with other systems, such as email systems
 dhwani mail pranaaliyon main neeche diye gaye chitra main dikhaae gaye kai tatv hote hai: 600px neeche diye gaye chitra main dikhaaya gaya he ki dhwani mail pranali pibiex ke saath kaise antarkriya karti he
 Imagine an external caller calling Fred's extension 2345
 aane vaali kol saarvajanik network se aati he or pibiex main pahunchati he
 The call is sent to Fred's extension, but Fred does not respond
 ghantiyon kii ek nishchit sankhya ke baad, pibiex fred ke ekstansion par ghanti bajaanaa band kar detaa he or kol ko dhwani mail pranali se jude ek ekstansion kii ore agreshit kar detaa he
 It does this because pbxs are usually programmed to forward busy or unanswered calls to another extension
 iske saath hi pibiex dhwani mail pranali ko bataata he ki uske dwaara dhwani mail ko agreshit kii ja rahi kol ekstansion 2345 par fred ke liye he
 In this way, the voicemail system can answer the phone with Fred's greeting
 pranali bhar main kai microprocesar hote hai, kyonki pranali ko badi maatra main jaankaree kii saar- sambhaal kerani hoti he or isamen kisi bhi tarah kaa pratiksha samay asweekaarya he
 
 jab fred kaa ekstansion dhwani mail pranali kii ore agreshit hota he, to telephone interfes ko ghanti ke bajane kaa pataa lag jaataa he
 He signals to the central processor that a call is coming
 iske saath hi sipiu ko pibiex-dhwani mail data link se sanket miltaa he ki ekstansion 2345 ko ghanti bajane par jawaab nahin milane ke kaaran ab baj rahe vishisht ekstansion kii ore agreshit kiya ja rahaa he
 The CPU instructs the telephone interface to answer the call
 sipiu ke kaarykram ko jab yah gyaat hota he ki yah kol fred ke liye he, to vah turant fred kii shubhakamana kii khoj karata he or discs niyantrak ko collar ke liye use bajaane kaa nirdesh detaa he
 He also narrates some instructions of the system by which the caller is given an indication of the subsequent developments
 
 phone karne vaale se sari "baatcheet" dhwani mail pranali main sangrahit kaarykram ke anusaar sipiu dwaara chune gaye prampton ke madhyam se kii jaati he
 The CPU selects the prompts as a response to the buttons pressed by the caller
 collar ke sandesh ko telephone interfes pranali dwaara digitikrut karke sandesh discon par bhandaaran ke liye discs niyantrak ke paas pareshit kar diya jaataa he
 Some voicemail systems flatten the message for greater security
 phir sipiu fred ke melbox nirdeshika pravesh ke bheetar pranali discs main us sandesh ke sthaan kaa bhandaaran kar letaa he
 After the caller turns off the phone and stores the message, it sends a signal to the PBX via a link to the CPU instructing the PBX to turn on the message waiting light on Fred's phone
 jab fred apni mej par waapas aata he or apane phone par batti jalte dekhtaa he, vah dhwani mail pranali ke liye namankit ek ekstansion number par phone karata he
 The telephone interface then alerts the CPU that a call is coming on a particular line, but this time the pbx-voicemail data link indicates that Fred is making the call directly, not being forwarded
 sipiu telephone antarfalak ko phone kaa jawaab dene kaa nirdesh detaa he
 Since the CPU "knows" it is Fred, it searches Fred's information, especially his password, on the system's disk
 sipiu phir discs niyantrak ko upyogkarta ke liye ek log-on prampt bajaane ke liye nirdesh detaa he: "kripaya apana password pravisht karen"
 ek baar password pravisht karne par, sipiu iskaa milan sahi password se karata he or, sahi dhang se pravesh kiya hone par, fred ko jari rakhane kii anumati detaa he
 The CPU then determines that a new message has been received for Fred
 phir sipiu fred ke saamne uske vikalp prastut karata he
 To hear your new message, press 1, press 2 to record the message, etc
) Options are offered by the CPU instructing the disk controller to play the prompt and the CPU listens to Fred's touchdowns
 prampton ko bajaane or sparsh-tone se jawaab dene kii yah antarkriya fred ko dhwani mail pranali se antarkriya karne main sahaayta karti he
 If Fred presses 1 to listen to his message, the CPU looks for the status of the new message in Fred's mailbox directory and instructs the disk controller to play that message
 discs niyantrak sandesh discs par sandesh kii khoj karata he or telephone interphes ke paas sidhe data stream bhejtaa he
 The telephone interface then converts the data stream into sound, and Fred plays the message through the line interface card through which it is connected
 punarchalan niyantran sparsh tone ke madhyam se kiye gaye sabhi input sipiu dwaara "padhein" jate hai or pranali main sangrahit kaarykram ke aadhaar par uchit karrwai kii jaati he
 For example, if Fred wants to stop the playback of the message, he can press 2
 chunki sipiu fred se aa rahe sparsh-tonon ko lagaataar sunata rahata he, uskaa aadesh milane par vah discs niyantrak ko sandesh ko bajaanaa band karne kaa nirdesh detaa he
 Most sophisticated voicemail systems offer a variety of playback controls and options so that users can control the playback of messages, archive messages, send messages in groups, change their preferences, etc

 is mat ke upaask lingayat kehalaate hai
 The word is derived from the Kannada word lingwant
 ye log mukhyatah mahatma basavanna kii shikshaaon ke anugami hai
 The literal meaning of 'veerashaiva' is - 'one who is a supreme devotee of Shiva'
 kintu samay bitne ke saath virshaiv kaa tatvagyan darshan, sadhana, karmkand, saamaajik sanghatan, acharnium aadi anya sampradaayon se bhinn hote gaye
 Although Veerashaiva is also found in other parts of the country - Maharashtra, Andhra, Tamil region, etc
, Karnataka has the largest number of them
 shaiva log apane dharmik vishwaason or darshan kaa udgam vedon tathaa 28 shaivagamon se maanate hai
 Veerashaiva also does not show disbelief in the Vedas but in his philosophy, rituals and social reforms, such specialties have developed which are mainly derived from Shaivagams and such insight yogis who are known as 'vaadikars'
 12veen se 16 veen shatee ke bich lagbhag teen shatabdiyon main koi 300 vachanakaar hue hai jinamein se 30 striyaan rahi hai
 The most famous of these is Basava, who was the Prime Minister of the Jain king of Kalyan, Vizjal
 vah yogi mahatma hi na tha balki karmath sanghatankarta bhi tha jisane virshaiv sampradaay kii sthapana kii
 The goal of Vasava was to create a spiritual society in which caste, religion or women were not discriminated against
 vah karmkand sambandhi aadambar kaa virdohi tha or maansik pavitrataa evam bhakthi kii sachaai par bal detaa tha
 He was a supporter of the worship of only one God and tried to simplify the method of worship and meditation
 jati bhed kii samaapti tathaa striyon ke utthan ke kaaran samaaj main adbhut kranti utpann ho gai

 Veerashaiva is sometimes called 'sharan' or Shiva Sharan of Mahatmas, ie people who have given themselves to Shiva's refuge
 unki sadhana shivayog kehalaati he
 Veerashaivism is basically monotheistic philosophy but is essentially beyond divine action and meditation and the existence of the world in our real experience cannot be explained without desire and action, hence Shiva's Shakti Siddhanta was conceived
 ishwar se ekta sthapit karne ke liye aadhyatmik aakankshi apni ek yaa teenon shaktiyon kaa prayog karata he
 The name of the use of love power is bhakti yoga, the knowledge of the use of thinking power and the name of the use of karma power is karma yoga
 inhen ke jariye parameshwar ke saath antim rup se ekta sthapit hoti he
 There is no doubt that the Veerashaivas also have temples, shrines, etc
 as in other sects, the difference being only between the deities who are worshiped
 jahaan tak virashaivon kaa sabandh he, devalayon yaa sadhana ke anya prakaaron kaa utana mahatv nahin he jitna isht ling kaa jisaki pratimaa sharir par dhaaran kii jaati he
 The spiritual master offers a favored penis to each Veerashaiva and bursts the sacred conspirator mantra 'om Nam Nam Shivaay' in his ear
 prayek virshaiv snanadi kar haath kii gadeli par isht ling kii pratimaa rakhkar chintan or dhyaan dwaara aradhana karata he
 Needless to say that every Veerashaiva is expected to possess high moral qualities like truthfulness, non-violence, fraternity
 vah niraamish bhoji hota he or sharaab aadi maadak vastuon se parhez karata he
 The summary of the directions issued by Basava in this regard is this - Do not steal, do not kill nor lie, do not praise or condemn others, treat all women other than your wife as mother
 veda, upanishad or shaivagam to sab sanskrit main he at: virshaiv vachanakaron ne unka saar or shaashvat satvon kaa sthoolansh kannada bhashaa evam sahitya main samavisht kar uski sambruddhi kii

 Metaphor is a type of semantic rhetoric in literature that is described only as a theorem or subhuman by accusing the unprepared in presenting on the basis of too much equilibrium, ie accusative of the subcomponent or sublimation of subhuman and lacking both distinctions
 iske sang roopak, abhed rupak, tadrup roopak, nune roopak, paramparit roopak aadi anek bhed hai
 Example- Charan Kamal Bandoon Harirai vyutpatti : jiskaa koi rup ho
 Containing form
 rupi
 The analogy and metaphysics of the metaphor have more seriousness and closeness than the psychological point of view
 apni baat kehane ke liye, apana abhipret purnat: sampreshit karne ke liye, kavi-maanas main kisi duusare padaarth kaa 'aropan hota he
 As soon as the beauty of the mouth is meditated, the poet-consciousness exerts the ultimate paradigm of beauty and in what form it does, it is its various utterances or gestures
 roopak main ek padaarth main duusare kaa aropan, abhed-sthaapan hota he yaa ek rupata kii sthapana hoti he
 The meaning of imperviousness is' identification of identity, even while making or amending Upma, in the poet-mind, it will first be 'identity belief' and complete impulse-setting is basically a tendency to metaphor, not to Upma
 isliye kaha ja saktaa he ki kavi kii rachana-prakriya main prathmat: roopak kaa hi prasphuton hota he
 That is why the metaphor has been considered as' analogous impregnated, accusative ornamentation
 isse bhi aage badhkar yah alankaar maatr nahin apitu kavy-chetana kaa nitant aavashyak upadan lagata he
 The best poetry can be composed without ornamentation, but without metaphor-consciousness, the best poet-deeds are not possible
 upama par vichaar karte hue, acharya ruyyak ne teen prakaar ke samya kaa ullekh kiya he- bhedpradhan, abhedpradhan tathaa bhedabhedpradhan - Acharya Mammatt etc
 has also accepted 'extreme equanimity' in the metaphorical analogy
 isi ko or spasht karte hue aage vritti main kaha gaya he- This tendency of metaphor's' extreme equilibrium leads to the conclusion that any analogy in the poet-consciousness first arises in the mindset of the metaphor, the analogy of the metaphor appears later as a conflation of the statement
 isiilie upama ke saadrishy ko 'bhedabhedpradhan rup main sweekaara gaya he
 The analogy legislation done with the help of Upman is mostly morphological and sometimes based on properties
 kintu phir bhi vah itnaa prabhavi nahin ho paata, jitna roopak ke dwaara rachitbimb
 The metaphor expresses the underlying equilibrium in two unequal and independent units
 ek prakaar kii gadyatmak yaa neeras samanta, tulana se aage badhkar roopak ek aisa tadatmya upasthit karata he, jisase do bhinn padaarthon yaa kaary-vyapaaron main ek samekan upasthit hokar ek nayi chhavi ubhartee he, jisamen donon hi padaarthon yaa kaary-vyapaaron kii vishistataaen samahit hoti hai
 This comparison between the two is irrational, in which the questions raised by intellect will end its beauty
 vah to ek sundar bimb srujit kar kavi kaa abhipret pathak / shrota tak pahunchaata he
 In this way, the metaphor generates a circle of light around it, in whose light the poet's mind becomes completely devoted
 yah uski deepakdharmee pravriti he
 Hence the 'metaphorical poet' can be called the base of karma
 yah kavi kii 'roopak chetana hi he, jo abhivyakti ke vibhinn roopon main, vibhinn alankaaron ke dwaara, prakashit ho uthati he
 Even an ordinary poet can use Upma on the basis of Upmaan selection, but only a master poet can make beautiful and effective use of metaphor
 tulsidas kii lokapriyata or mahanata kaa bahut bada rahasy unki abhivyakti main isi shreshth roopak-chetana kaa he
 Existing with communion and resemblance, 'extreme communism' originates in the metaphorical form of the poet-mind, but by the style of expression it takes the form of various figures
 isliye roopak, sanrupak, upama, utpreksha, drushtaant, nidarshana, udhaaharan, prateep, vyatirek, apahnuti, andeh, bhrantimaan aadi alankaar kavi kii roopak-chetana se hi udbhoot hote hai
 The basic thing is based on the metaphor itself, the mere manipulation of words, the presentation of a statement, establishes it as another form of speech
 kalidas kii upamaaon par vichaar karte hue dow shashibhushan das gupt kehete hai - In the context of Tulsi, it can be said that his metaphor-consciousness in the form of metaphor, sangarupak, simile, catalysis, parable, pratip, vyritarek, etc
, overwhelms the heart by manifesting in the form of the primordial and original form
 isliye is mahakavi kii roopak-chetana ke shreshth se parichit hone ke liye unke kavy main prayukt in alankaaron ke moulik, maarmik evam prabhavi rup se parichit hona aavashyak he

 Among the metals used for this work, zinc and vang are the main ones

 There are four methods of zinc plating on steel: 1-ushn nimajjan prakriya ; 2-electrolytic turbidity; 3-sherardikaran 4- Hot metal spray

 The basis of all electrodynamic solutions is zincsulfate
 is vidhi main lep kii janevaali vastu ko dhaatu ke drum yaa baks main jastachurna se gher kar, jisamen dhatvik jasta rahata he, garam karte hai
 This method is especially suitable for items on which very thin coating is required for preservation and where the carving, pattern and design of the characters are to be kept as they are
 isamen yahi dosha he ki choti moti vastuon par hi isse jasta chadhaaya ja saktaa he
 In this method, a light spray of melted zinc on a pre-cleaned hot steel is done with a special type of metal atomizer
 bade bade paatro par jasta chadhaane ke liye yah sugam vidhi he
 This coating does not make alloys with steel
 saadhaaran jasti lep vayumandaleey tathaa drav sanksharan ke prati khule rahete hai or mitti ke sanksharan ke prati kam maatra main khule rahete hai
 Their atmospheric corrosion resistance is dependent on contamination against airborne acid substances, such as sulfur dioxide at industrial locations, sodium chloride near saline water lakes or the oceans
 is tarah gramin kshetron main audyogic kshetron kii apeksha jasti lep kii aayu 4 se lekar 10 guna tak adhik hoti he
 The amount of corrosion of the galvanized sheets in the fluid, or by the fluid, depends on the concentration of hydrogen ion of the corrosive medium
 piech 6 or 12 ke bich sangrakshi film sthaayee hota he
 The sheets quickly degrade as the ph increases to 4 and 12
5
 prabal khanij amlon ke kuch lakshanon, visheshat: chloride or nitrate vaale lavenon ke vilyan main jasta shighrata se ghul jaataa he
 Chemical, magnetic, microscopic and physics tests of galvanized sheets are carried out
 apalepan pareekshan rasinic he or yah jasti lep ke jaste ke bhaar ke antar par aadhaarit he, jo pareekshan ke samay villin ho jane se hota he
 The thickness of the coating is determined by magnetic testing without destroying the object
 jaste kaa lep achumbakeey hone ke kaaran chadar ke sanghnitr paripath kii chadar ke lep kii motaai ke anusaar prerana main parivartan ho jaataa he
 This change is measured and the thickness is calculated from it
 thik thik nikshaarit aadi kaat ke sookshmdarshi dwaara adhyayan se lep kii motaai or banaavat prakat hoti he
 Physical methods determine the deformations that normally occur by folding, folding, pressing the edge and pulling the sheet without removing the coating
 baar-baar saamne aanevaale dosha main mukhya dosha fafola padana he
 These blisters can range in size from a very fine size to a very large size, and occupy a narrow space on the surface of the sheet
 ispaat kii sataha ke asatatya ke kaaran hydrogen ekatra hota he or usase fafole banate hai
 The second drawback is the grayness of the coating
 isamen kshetra dhoosar rag kaa ho jaataa he, jisamen manibh yaa to bilkul hote nahin, athwa saamaanya vistaar se chote hote hai
 The definite reasons for this defect are: lohe main adhatu padaarthon kaa rah janaa or When the zinc comes out of the heat, the sheet is very fast frosting
