 Some symptoms of strep throat are similar to other diseases
 is kaaran se, gale kaa culture yaa twarit strape pareekshan kiye bina yah jaananaa kathin ho saktaa he ki kya vyakti ko strape throt kii samasya he
 If a person has fever or has a sore throat and sore throat with which it is coughing, runny, diarrhea, itching with redness in the eyes, then it is more likely that he has a problem of throat pain caused by virus

 These drugs also reduce the spread of the disease
 dawaaen mukhya rup se durlabh jatiltaaon jaise amvaat bukhaar, laal chaktton, yasankraman ko kam karne ke liye upyog kii jaati hai
 The good effects of antibiotics should be balanced by the possible side effects
 pratijaivik upachaar un swasth vayaskon ke liye thik nahin ho saktaa he jinako dawaaon kii vipareet pratikriyaayein hoti hon
 Antibiotics are often used more often than expected for strep throat, even when it is not as severe or less likely to spread
 dawa arithromicine unhi logon par istemaal kii jaani chaiye jinako allergy ho, wo bhi penniciline se
sephalosporin un logo par upyog kii ja sakati he jinako kam allergy hoti he
 Streptococcal infections can cause inflammation in the kidneys
 Antibiotics do not reduce the likelihood of this condition
 strape throt ke lakshan dawaaon ke madhyam se yaa unke bina bhi, lagbhag teen se paanch dinon main sudharne lagate hai
 Antibiotics reduce the risk of disease worsening through treatment
 ye beemaari ke failane ko bhi kathin kar dete hai
 Children can start going to school again 24 hours after taking the first antibiotic dose
 strape throt ke kaaran, nimnlikhit behad kharaab samasyaayein paidaa ho sakati hai: Strep throat is included in such a wide range that includes sore throat and painful throat problems or pharyngitis
 america main har saal lagbhag 11 million log karaash va dard vaale gale kii samasya se peedit hote hai
 Most cases of sore and painful throat problems are caused by viruses

 This resembles real number algebra, but is replaced by the corresponding logical operations of combining x + y and negation x with numerical operations of xy addition, x x, y, x x, y x and y निषेध x
 There are Boolean operations and all other operations such as these can be made from these, x ∧
 These turn out to be {0,1} sets that take only finitely many arguments to coincide with the set of all operations, there are 22N such operations when there are n arguments

 Computer users have a curiosity about whether they really need to adopt Windows Vista, the new operating system released by Microsoft
 kya microsoft ke pichley oparating system windos ekspe windos 2003 or windos 2000 kii tulana main isamen aise fitures hai jinaki andekhi karnaa sambhav na ho
 Microsoft claims that Vista is more capable, simpler, faster, smooth and secure than previous Windows

 Start up and shutdown processes are completed in five to ten seconds
 haalaanki isamen vista ke apekshaakrit behatar hardware kaa bhi yogadan he lekin khud oparating system ke code main bhi iske liye vishesh prayaas kiya gaya he
 Vista's boom is also due to its new memory management technology that keeps the most used applications ready for loading in advance
 ise 'memri fech' kaha jaataa he
 The Ready Boost feature in Vista has also contributed to its speed
 ab tak windos main memri sambandhi atirikt aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye virtual memri ke rup main pejafilon kaa istemaal hota tha
 These were placed on the computer's hard disk
 lekin vista main iske liye yuasabi drive kaa istemaal karne kaa praavdhaan he jo hard discs kii tulana main bahut tej gati se kaary karti he

 microsoft ne vista main is baat par khaas dhyaan diya he
 Although Vista's original 'kernel' is not rewritten, its security has been strengthened this time

 And it would be very difficult to get administrator level privileges, especially in offices

 It is also not that you as a normal user cannot install the software in your computer
 aisa karne ke liye unhen asthaayee taur par jaruri adhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Microsoft has created two categories of computers for installing Vista operating system - Vista Capable PC and Vista Premium Ready
 aise sabhi computer windos vista sakasham hai jinamein kam se kam 800 megahatrj kaa procesar or 512 embi system memri uplabdh ho
 Such processors are rare now because hardly anyone is buying less than 2 ghz processor in the market

 It may be a matter of system memory that your traditional computer may have 128 MB or 256 MB memory

 There are no clear criteria to express the continent
 alag-alag sabhyataaon or vaigyanikon nen mahadweep kii alag paribhaasha di he
 But the general opinion is that a continent is a very large area of the earth whose boundaries can be clearly identified
 prithvi par kitne mahadweep he is baat par puri sahmati nahin he
 Some people accept four or five continents, but most people choose to have six, or seven continents
 bhuvaigyanikon me mukhya rup se do matbhed he
 The first is whether to consider Europe and Asia as separate continents or to combine these two as one continent Eurasia
 Secondly, should North America and South America be considered as separate continents or together they should be considered as a continent of America
 Some geography scientists have also suggested that Europe, Asia and Africa should be considered as Eurasia

 Such wars were considered crusades in India

 In the later Vedic period, pre-existing practices were reformed by making new rules regarding them

 The wars of Rama Ravana, Bali Sugriva and Duryodhana and Bhima are examples of this
 parvarti kaal main bhi in yudhon kaa yathesht prachlan tha
 This method was adopted to decide the things which could not be resolved among the Kshatriyas in other ways
 bahudhaa aisa hota tha ki yuddh ke liye sena lekar do raajaaon ke aamane saamne khadey hone par, raktapaat bachaane ke liye yah nishchay kiya jaataa tha ki virdohi senaaon main se ek ek, yaa nishchit baraabar sankhyaon main, yoddha aapas main dharmayuddh se laden or jis paksh kaa yoddha jite usee kii jeet maani jaae
 Sometimes by fighting the soldiers, one king or general commanding the other to battle and the victory of the couple's victory would settle the feud of the states
 yah reeti dakshin bharat ke hindu raajaaon main kuch sau varsh purv tak prachlit thi
 The duel in other countries was also practiced because of the belief that it was a method of divine justice, but it was not universally accepted in some form from Japan to Aryland and from the Mediterranean to the northern latitudes
 europe ke pracheen panditon ke anusaar bible main varnit david or goliath kaa nyayuddh ishwaranumodith tha
 On this basis, the rationale of duel was accepted in the medieval period
 atipracheen kaal se aadisht dwandvayuddh ke europe main pranrabh kaa thik pataa nahin chalata, kintu elliod main varnit menelmos or paris is prasiddh yuddh ke aarambh main sampadit vistrut vidhiyon se is granth ke lekhak unani kavi homer ke samay prachlit is sambandh ke shishtachar kii prathaon or pracheen ritiyon kaa pataa chalata he
 Evidence of the practice of dueling is found in the inhabitants of the territory of Ambria in ancient Italy and also among the Slavic castes
 kintu rome rajya main isaki pratha na thi, varan romavaasi ise asabhy logon kaa chalan samajhate the
 But even in this period, the famous Roman commander, Sipio Afracanus, found it prevalent in Spain in 203 BC
 pracheen german jatiyon main bhi iskaa prachlan tha
 Due to the strategic traditions that led to the era of feudalism and the brave warriors in Europe, after the fall of the Roman Empire, the duel also took over all of Europe in the kingdom of Louis debonaire, who established the empire from 814 to 840
 The judge would have ordered a duel if the accused had been convicted and the defendant disapproved of it
 isamen andeh nahin ki dwandvayudhon kii bhaavana ke mul main saahas par aadhaarit nijee pratishtha or sammaan kaa bhav bhi tha
 If a defiant person did not accept to fight, he was considered cowardly and inferior
 europe main 16veen sadi ke madhya tak dwandvayuddh se nyaay kii pratha saadhaarant: vidhisammat thi
 These wars were fought by standing in confined areas and bound by fixed laws and strict rules
 ek sarvaprachlit niyam ke anusaar, jis manushya ko lalakaara jaataa tha usee ko hathiyaaron ke chunane kaa adhikaar hota tha
 According to another rule, any kind of witchcraft, or any kind of help from friends and audience, was forbidden
 is prakaar ke yuddh main yadhyapi dwandv shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, tathaapi bharat ke sadrush europe main bhi kabhi kabhi yuddhrat prayek paksh main anek manushya hote the
 Thus a battle took place in 1396 in the Royal and Scottish castes of King Robert III

 In France, Henry II ended the judicial duel in 1547 in front of a king or tribunal

 Along with those who fought in such wars, two or more friends also lived to see that no irregularity or injustice should occur

 Due to its political background, the friendly inspectors who came from both sides came to a halt in each other

 is ghatana ne nirikshakon ke bhi dwandvayuddh main bhaag lene kii pratha ko, jo aage lagbhag 75 varshon tak chaalu rahi, europe bhar main janm diya
 In the 16th and 17th centuries, a number of laws were enacted in most of the countries of Europe to oppose the duel, but when defying war, it was considered cowardice, such wars were rampant in the society and the central power was limited
 in kaarnon se ye roke na ja sake
 But in 1643, the situation changed when Louis the 14th ascended to the throne of France, as he set the death penalty for those who took part in such wars
 tab prakaashya rup se is prakaar ke yuddh band ho gaye, par ve duusare rup main chalate rahe
 Those desirous of a duel would fight alone in a secluded place without expressing any of the short swords prevailing at the time and if one of them was killed, the other would have saved his life by saying that the act was done in self-defense to avoid the law
 
 par jab is pratha kii aad main hatyaayein hone lageen to nirjan sthaan main dwandvayuddh hona band ho gaya or nirikshakon kii pratha phir chal padi, par ye swayan nahin ladate the
 Sword fighting was the practice until the 19th century
 tab tak in yudhon main niyamon kaa kadai se paalan karnaa aavashyak kar diya gaya tha tathaa france main jyon hi raktapaat hua, yuddh band kar diya jaataa tha
 Thus there was no possibility of special loss in these wars
 is samay tathaa baad main bhi germany ke vidhyaarthiyon main ek vishesh prakaar kii talwaar se dwandv yuddh kaa chalan tha, par isamen shariraraksha ke sadhano, jaise kavach ityadi, kaa upyog hota tha or ghaav lage bhi to vah saadhaarant: uparisht hota tha
 The use of pistols in these wars began from the mid-18th century
 prarambh se yah pratha thi ki talwaar tathaa khanjar se susajjit ghudsavaar pratidwandvi, haathon main bhari hui pistaul liye, ek duusare par jhapat padate the tathaa paas se guzarate samay ek duusare par pistaul chalaate the
 If both the warriors survived, they would return and fight with swords and daggers
 san 1780 tak bhoomi par khadey hokar pistaul se dwandv yuddh ladanaa bhalee bhanti prachlit ho gaya tha or is kaary ke liye vishesh prakaar ke pistaul banaae jane lage the
 This type of warfare was most prevalent in England during the reign of George IV, when the Duke of Wellington, Lord Vinchilsey, the Marquis of Londonderry and the famous banquet soldier, Bo Brammel, also landed in the arena of the duel
 is prakaar ke yudhon main hataahaton kii sankhya kaa anumaan san 1836 main likhe ek lekh se lagata he, jiske lekhak ke anusaar pistaul ke do sau se upar panjikrut dwandvayudhon main prayek chah manushyon main se ek ghayal paaya gaya tathaa prati 13 manushyon main se ek kii mrityu hui
 The misuse and ill effects of these types of wars were becoming evident from the long standing before the sensible people
 europe ke vibhinn deshon main inako rokane ke liye niyam banaaya gaya ki dwandvayuddh ke aparaadhiyon ko padchyut kar diya jaae
 The effect of this was that it stopped the practice of both military and civilian citizens of England
 san 1850 ke lagbhag anya sab deshon se bhi yah pratha uth gai

 Before the 20th century, the names of Dhumketu were named on the basis of year, such as 'great Dhumketu of 1580', 'great Dhumketu of September 1882'
 a scientist named Edmund Haley proved that the comet seen in 1531, 1607 and 1582 was the same and predicted to reappear in 1957
 In fact, in 1959, this comet reappeared in the sky, when it was named Haley Dhumketu
 Similarly, the names of the recurring dhumkets were named after the person who computed his tour class
 Since then, recurring dhumkets have been named after the one who searched for them, but only once visible dhumkhetoos are named after the year in which they appear even today

 In 1994 the International Astronomical Union approved the new naming system
 The names of comets are now represented by the year they are searched, by the indication of the fortnight they have been discovered, and by the serial number of the search for the same year
 Such a system is already being used for asteroids
 Thus in the second fortnight of February 2006, Dhumketu, which is the fourth comet discovered in that year, will be named 2006 D4
 The prefix is also added to indicate the nature of the comet

 Is Similarly, the name of Haley Comet which was first identified as a recurring comet is 1P / 1682 Q1

 Some people called it a falling star
 Aristotle discussed comets in his first book Mitrology
 Many earlier intellectuals recognized it as the planets of the solar system
 But Aristotle rejected this notion because the planets appear in a fixed constellation in the sky while comets can be seen anywhere in the sky
 According to Aristotle, comets were born in the outer atmosphere of the Earth
 Like comets, Aristotle had the same belief for meteors, auroras, boreolias and galaxies
 Many erstwhile intellectuals disagreed with this view of Aristotle
 Seneca disagreed on this view in the Natural Question
 According to him, comets have no effect on the external environment or wind
 Human beings then had little knowledge about space
