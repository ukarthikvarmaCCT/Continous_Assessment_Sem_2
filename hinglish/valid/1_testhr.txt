 All scientific subjects come under this in a small amount
 vigyaan kii anya shakhayein yaa to sidhe hi bhautik par aadhaarit hai, athwa inke tathyon ko iske mul siddhanton se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 The importance of physics is also more because being the birthplace of engineering and crafts science, it is the basic motivator of all social and economic development of this era
 bahut pehle isko darshan shaastra kaa ang maanakar natural philosophy yaa prakritik darshanashastra kehete the, kintu 1870 isvi ke lagbhag isko vartmaan naam bhautikee yaa physics dwaara sambodhit karne lage
 Gradually this science kept progressing and at this time seeing the rapid pace of its development, even the leading physicists are surprised

 Physics can be broadly divided into two parts
 1900 isvi se purv jo bhautik gyaan arjeet kiya gaya tha or tatsambandhi jo niyam tathaa siddhant pratipaadit kiye gaye the, unka samavesh chirsmmat bhautikee main kiya gaya
 The inspirations of the ideology of that time were Galileo and Newton
 chirsmmat bhautikee ko mukhyat: yantriki, dhvaniki, ooshmaa, vidyutchumbakatv or prakaashiki main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 These branches are the cornerstone of engineering and craft science and elementary education in physics is started from them only
 1900 isvi ke pashchaat anek krantikari tathy gyaat hue, jinako chirasmmati bhautikee ke dhaanche main baithaana kathin he
 The branch of physics that originated in studying these new facts and solving their clues is called modern physics
 aadhunik bhautikee kaa dravyasanrachana se sidhaa sambandh he
 Atomic elements, nuclei and basic particles are their main subjects
 bhautikee kii is naveen shakha ne vaigyanik vichaardhaara ko naveen or krantikari mode diya he tathaa isse samaajik vigyaan or darshanashastra bhi mahatvapurn rup se prabhavit hue hai
 'currently solid state physics is known as modern physics where we reads about construction and energy of material
 There are some other branches but Electronics is the latest

 The weight of walls, pillars and pillars of buildings and bridges is distributed on the earth by their foundation or foundation
 at: nirmaan kaary main buniyaad, bahut mahatvapurn ang he
 If the foundation is weak, the load carrying power of the entire building or bridge is greatly reduced
 agar buniyaad ek baar kamjor rah gai, to baad main use sudhaarna praaia: asambhav sa hi ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the design of the foundation should be made very efficiently
 neenv kaa vishesh prayojan yah he ki vah upar se bhaar kaa baraabar se bhoomi par is prakaar vitarit kare ki vahaan kii mitti par uski bhardhari kshamta se adhik boj na pade, nahin to mitti ke baithne se bhawan ityadi main daraar padane kaa bhay rahata he
 Knowledge of the load carrying capacity of different types of soil or rocks is essential for the design of the foundation
 nimnlikhit sarini main bhinn bhinn prakaar kii mittiyon kii bhardhari kshamta di gai he - Comment- prithvi kii sataha se gaharaai jitani badhegi saadhaarant: mitti kii bhardhari kshamta bhi gaharaai ke hisaab se badhati jaaegi
 In general, water moisture reduces the load carrying capacity of the soil
 isiilie adhiktar bhawanon kii neenv jameen se kam se kam teen chaar foot gahari rakhi jaati hai, jisase varsha main nami kaa asar is gaharaai par bahut kam ho jaataa he
 For a land where water is full, the carrying capacity should be taken slightly below average
 bade bhawan tathaa pul ityadi ke liye mitti kii puri jaanch mitti jaanchnewali kisi prayogshaala dwaara kara leni chahie
 The most essential in foundation design is its width, by which it spreads the total burden on the foundation in such a way that the load on the ground does not exceed its endurance
 agar jameen kii bhardhari kshamta "sa" he tathaa kul bhaar neenv kii prati foot lambaai par "bha" he, to neenv kii chaudaai "c" nimnlikhit sameekaran se nikaali ja sakati hai : This can be derived from Rankin's following equation: isamen sa = jameen kii bhardhari kshamta, a = eent athwa pathar yaa kancreet kaa, jisase neenv banegi, prati varg foot bhaar tathaa q = vah kone, jisamen mitti apane aap prakritik dhang se ho jaati he 
 Usually, the depth of the foundation that will be given by the above formula in building construction will be very small
 saadhaaran mitti main neenv adhiktar teen, chaar foot gahari rakhi jaati he
 Typically, building construction consists of lime or cement concrete in the floor and brick canopy over it to spread the foundation, leaving every 2
25-inch poppy of brick chosen

 net ran rate cricket ke khel main prayog kii jane vaali ek sankhyikee he
 It is a common system for dividing a team into one-day league competition, similar to the "goal difference" in football as it is used in cricket
 ek ekal khel main net ran rate, prati over kaa vah ran rate he jo us match main team dwaara arjeet kiya jaataa he or usamen se unke khilaaf banaae gaye prati over ran rate ko gata diya jaataa he
 a team's run rate is divided by their total runs over the overs they have played
 ek over main chah gende hoti he, net ran rate hisaab ke prayojan ke liye prayek gend kii ek over main 1 / 6 gend ke rup main gananaa kii jaati he, haalanki cricket sanketan main aam taur par ek over ke ek gend ke liye 
1 ke rup main vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 So if a team scores 250 runs in 50 overs, then their run rate will be 250 50 = 5 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {250} {50}} = 5}
 If they score the same in 47
5 overs, their run rate will be 250 47 5 6 ≈ 5
226 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {250} {47 { \ frac {5} {6 xxrep 4 } \ approx 5
226}
 net ran rate kii avadharana main team ke ran rate se pratidwandi ke antim ran rate ko nikaal dena shaamil he
 The only problem is that if a team is dismissed and it does not divide the scores they have made from the balls faced; The entire quota of overs is used instead
 aamtaur par, lig talika main tiimon kii tulana karne ke liye sampoorn sizan main ran or phenke gaye overon kii gananaa kii jaati he, jaise nimnlikhit sutara pradarshit karte hai- net run rate = total runs scored total overs faced - total runs conceded total overs bowled { \ displaystyle { \ mbox {net run rate}} = { \ frac { \ mbox {total runs scored}} { \ mbox {total overs faced} }} - { \ frac { \ mbox {total runs conceded}} { \ mbox {total overs bowled xxrep 4 } sabhi paridrishy ko prayek paksh kii team ke 50 over ke saath antarrashtriya ek divasiy niyam ko liya jaataa he

 According to this theory, the position and momentum of a moving particle cannot be measured exactly simultaneously
 yadi ek raashi adhik shuddhta se maapi jaaegi to duusari ke maapan main utani hi ashuddhta bad jaaegi, chaahe ise maapne main kitni hi kushalta kyon na barti jaae
 The product of the impurities of these quantities cannot be less than the Planck constant
 yadi kisi gatiman kan ke sthiti nirdashank x ke maapan main δ x { \ displaystyle \ Delta x}, kii truti or x-aksh kii disha main uske samveg p ke maapne main δ p { \ displaystyle \ Delta p}, kii truti ho to is siddhant ke anusaar - Where, ħ = h / 2 π { \ displaystyle \ hbar = h / 2 \ pi}, h is the Planck constant
 isse prakat hota he ki kisi kan kaa koi nirdashank or uske samveg kaa tatsangan sanghatak donon ek saath yatharthatapurvak nahin jane ja sakate or yadi in donon sanyugmi raashiyon main se ek kii anischitata bahut kam ho to duusari kii bahut adhik hoti he
 The relationship of uncertainty on the one hand is the inevitable result of the laws of probability of establishing the consistency of a wave's position with the particle, and on the other the broader rules of probability interpretation
 hisenberg or mohar ne naapane kii prakriya kaa sookshm or gahan vishleshan karke yah siddh kar diya ki kisi bhi maap ke parinaam anischitata siddhant ke pratikul nahin nikal sakate
 If we measure the position of a particle accurately, then the uncertainty of its position will be equal to zero
 tab us kan ke samveg kii anischitata ganit ke niyamon ke anusaar: That means it will become infinite
 at: ham is saral nishkarsh par pahunchne ke liye baadhya ho jate hai ki jis kshankaal par ham kan kii sthiti kii yatharth maap praapt karte hai us kaal par uskaa veg anirnit ho jaataa he
 If the velocity of the particle at any given moment is measured with absolute precision, then we have no option to find out what the position of the particle was at that moment
 aisi avasthaa main sthiti or samveg donon kii maap kuch anischitataaon ke bheetar hi sambhav he
 In this way, Heisenberg proved that in the world of microscopic particles the usefulness of measuring instruments is limited
 ye upkaran kanon kii gati ko yatharth rup main maapne main aksham hote hai
 In many fields of science and technology, the scale of measuring microscopic measurements is quite high and there is a steady progress in this direction, but the uncertainty principle sets a certain limit for the accuracy of the measurements
 upkaran kii shuddhta is seemaa se adhik nahin sakati
 Today, almost all physicists accept the impossibility of inventing a measuring instrument that can violate the limits contained in this theory

 According to another view, the first letter of the Himalayas, "hi" and the last letter "indu" of Indu, these two letters formed the word "hindu" and this land was called Hindusthan
 hindu shabd us samay dharm ke bajaay rashtriyata ke rup main prayukt hota tha
 Since at that time there were only people who believed in Vedic religion in India, but no other religion had emerged till then, so the word "hindu" was used for all Indians

 manushya hi aisa praani he jo is lok main paap or punya, dono karm bhoga saktaa he or moksh praapt kar saktaa he
 There are four main sects in Hinduism: Vaishnavism, Shaiva, Shakta and Smarta

 jinhen madhyakaal ke santon ne samanvit karne kii safal koshish kii or sabhi sampradaayon ko paraspar ashrith bataaya
 In short, the main elements of Hinduism are the following: Hinduism - Hinduism - who? - Goshu Bhaktibhavedyasya Pranave ch steadha matih

 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world

 Players cannot do any such trick that makes their king under attack
 yadi khilaadi ke paas koi vaid chaal nahin bachi he, to khel khatm ho gaya he; yah yaa to ek maat he - yadi raja hamale main he - yaa ek gatirodh yaa shah - yadi raja hamale main nahin he

 Castling involves the king being raised two squares towards the rook and placing the rook on the other side of the king just next to it
 caseling keval tabhi kiya ja saktaa he jab nimnlikhit sharten puri hon: If player A's pawn moves two squares forward and player B's pawn is in the 5th horizontal row in the corresponding vertical row, then B's pawn can cut A's pawn, if only one square of it moves
 kaatane kii yah kriya keval iske thik baad vaali chaal main kii ja sakati he
 In this example, if the white pawn comes from A2 to A4, then the black pawn on B4 will cut it to A3 by cutting it by Ampasan method

 Chess is one of the earliest games, which evolved into a four-player war game called Chaturanga and is the Sanskrit name for a battle sequence mentioned in the Indian epic Mahabharata
