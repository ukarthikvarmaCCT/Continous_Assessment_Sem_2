 According to the Quran, the word means voluntary offering, whose wealth is at the will of the "giver"
 arabi shabdaawalee ke anusaar, jad sa da qa se praapt shabd "dharmikata or sachai ke vichaaron ke saath jude kai arth" ko cover karte hai

 Some experts therefore conclude that the word Sadaka is a word derived from another language

 The Quran states that Sadaka should not be in any physical form and may be a "voluntary effort" or a type of word

 "from the Quranic point of view, good words with" insult "and" mercy "are better than Sadaka, and to offer" intelligence "to charity rather than to do it in public to be accepted by the Quran
 He also criticizes donating for the purpose of compromising the value of the benevolent or the benevolent by "demonizing public behavior", "just charitable work in general, purely voluntary
" While doing
 " quran kaa suzav he ki sadaaka kaa matlab keval garibon kaa samarthan karne ke liye nahin he, balki un logon ko bhi daan kiya ja saktaa he jo "jarurat nahin dikh rahe the" or jinke jivan ko badhaane ke liye unhen sahaayta kii zarurat thi yaa jinhen nai naukariyon kii disha main nirdeshit kiya janaa chahie or "aarthik avasar "
 According to some hadiths, "a kind of word and a smile" can be considered as everlasting and its best form is "passing on knowledge"
 " iske alaava, mohammad ne haddees main kaha tha ki sadaaka buraai ke sattar daravaaje ko hataa detaa he
 On some occasions the term is used with zakat and nafaka, however, while zakat is mandatory, sadaqada usually refers to voluntary donations

 He presented a theory related to the development of higher cognitive functions in children
 apane kariar ke aarmabhik kaal main unka tark tha ki tark-shakti kaa vikaas chihnon evam pratikon ke madhyam se hota he
 Vygotsky's social outlook presents a progressive analysis of cognitive development
 vastut: vaigotsaki ne balak ke sangyanatmak vikaas main samaaj evam uske saanskrithik sambandhon ke bich samvaad ko ek mahatvapurn aayam ghoshit kiya
 Like onions, Vygotsky also believed that children build knowledge

 According to Vygotsky, a developmental approach is needed to understand the cognitive development of the child that can test it from the beginning and recognize the changes in various forms properly
 is prakaar ek vishisht maansik kaary jaise- aatm-bhashaa ko vikasaatmak prakriyaaon ke rup main moolyankit kiya jaae, na ki ekaaki rup se
 According to Vygotsky, to understand cognitive development, testing of tools that mediate and give shape to cognitive development is essential
 isi ke aadhaar par ve yah bhi maanate hai ki bhashaa sangyanatmak vikaas kaa mahatvapurn aujaar he
 According to them, during early childhood, the child starts using language as a tool in planning and problem solving
 vaayagaski ne san 1924-34 main institute of psycholaji main adhyayan kiya
 Here he did special work on cognitive development, especially on the relation of language and thinking
 unke adhyayan main sangyaan ke vikaas ke aitihaasik, saanskrithik or saamaajik karkon ke prabhaav kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 According to Waigaski, language is the major symbolic tool given by the society which is particularly important in the development of the child
 jis prakaar ham jal ke anu kaa adhyayan uske bhaagon ke dwaara nahin kar sakate, usee prakaar vyakti kaa adhyayan bhi uske vaataavaran se pruthak hokar nahi kiya ja saktaa

 According to Onge, development and learning are two distinct conceptions in which cognition affects language development as a natural process

 Thus according to the theory of onion, development is the precursor to learning and not the result

 According to the onus, it is necessary to first reach a certain development level for learning
 vaayagaski ke anusaar adhigam or vikaas kii parsparik prakriya main balak kii sakriy bhagidaari hoti he jisamen bhashaa kaa sangyaan par sidhaa prabhaav hota he

 According to him, the cognitive development of a child depends on the interrelationship with other people
 vaayagaski ne apane siddhanth main sangyaan or saamaajik vaataavaran kaa sammishran kiya
 Children come in contact with older and knowledgeable people than themselves and learn cultural ways of thinking and behavior
 saamaajik-saanskrithik siddhanth ke kai pramukh tatv he
 The first important element is personal language
 isamen balak apane vyavhaar ko niyantrit or nirdeshit karne ke liye swayan se baatcheet karte he
 The second important element of socio-cultural theory is the area of nearest development

 jab kisi material ko 0°k tak thanda kiya jaataa he to uskaa pratirodh purnatah shunya pratirohakata pradarshit karte hai
 This property of them is called superconductivity
 shunya pratirohakata ke alaava atichaalakata kii dasha main padaarth ke bheetar chumbakeey kshetra bhi shunya ho jaataa he jise mesanar prabhaav ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It is well known that the resistivity of metallic drivers decreases with their heat loss
 kintu saamaanya chaalkon jaise tanba or chaandi aadi main, ashuddhiyon or duusare apurnataaon ke kaaran ek seemaa ke baad pratirohakata main kami nahin hoti
 Even copper exhibits nonzero resistivity at absolute zero temperatures
 iske vipareet, atichaalak padaarth kaa taap krantik taap se neeche le jane par, isaki pratirohakata teji se shunya ho jaati he
 The electric current of a closed circuit made of superconducting wire can remain constant without any power source
 atichaalakata ek pramaatra-yantric drugvishay he
 Superconducting materials also exhibit the effect of magnetic reflection
 in sabakaa taap-vaidyut-bal shunya hota he or tamson-gunank baraabar hota he
 Their specific heat also undergoes a sudden change in transition heat
 yah vishesh ullekhneey he ki jin parmaanuon main bahya electronon kii sankhya 5 athwa 7 he unamem sankraman taap ucchtam hota he or atichaalakata kaa gun bhi utkrisht hota he
 1) Superconducting wires are used to make magnets with very high magnetic field intensity
 inhen atichaalak chumbak kehete hai
 They are used in particle accelerators
 2) bhavishya main inkaa upyog chote evam adhik kaarydaksh transafarmar, motor, vidyut janitr, aadi banane main kiya ja saktaa he
 3) Superconductors squid can be used for storing energy because once the current is set up in a superconducting loop and left it will continue to run for eternity
 5) iskaa upyog magnetic lavitesan main kiya ja sakegaa
 6) In addition to this, superconductivity is also being used in superconducting transmission lines, electromagnets, radio-frequency cavities, superconducting transistors, superconducting electron-beam lenses, superconducting bearings, bolometers, etc
 jab koi dhaatu kisi upyukt aakaar main, jaise belan athwa taar ke rup main lee jaati he, tab vah vidyut ke pravaah main kuch na kuch pratirodh avashya utpann karti he
 But first in 1911, the Kemerling Ones made a sensational discovery that if the mercury was cooled to below 4 degrees, its electrical resistance would suddenly collapse and become a good conductor
 lagbhag 20 dhaatuon main, jinamein ronga, paara, sisa ityadi pramukh hai, yah gun paaya jaataa he
 The temperature under which this condition is attained is called transition heat and the conductivity of this condition is superconductivity
 sankraman taap na keval bhinn-bhinn dhaatuon ke liye pruthak-pruthak hote hai, apitu ek hi dhaatu ke vibhinn samasthanikon ke liye bhi vibhinn hote hai
 Superconductivity properties are also found in many alloys such as palladium antimony
 parmaanu main electron andakaar path main parikrama karte hai or is drushti se ve chumbak jaisaa kaary karte hai
 The torque of these magnets is reduced by the external magnetic field
 duusare shabdon main, parmaanu visham chumbakeey prabhaav dikhaate hai
 If a material is placed in a suitable magnetic field, then the internal magnetic field of that conductor is destroyed, that is, it starts acting like a heterogeneous magnetic substance
 talaprishth par bahane vaali vidyut dhaaraon ke kaaran aantarik kshetra kaa maan shunya hi rahata he
 This is called the effect of mysnar
 yadi atichaalak padaarth ko dhire-dhire badhane vaale chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa jaae to kshetra ke ek vishesh maan par, jise dehali maan kehete hai, iskaa pratirodh punah apane purv maan ke baraabar ho jaataa he
 Several suggestions have been made to explain the theory of superconductivity
 kintu inamen se adhikansh ko keval aanshik safalataa hi praapt hui he
 In the present tense, the theory given by Bardeen, Cooper and Shreefer is sufficiently satisfactory
 iskaa sankshipt naam ve
si

 Accordingly, the conductivity is produced by the coupling of conductor electrons
 yah yugman electronon ke bich aakarshak bal utpann ho jane se paidaa hota he
 The main reason for the attractive force generated is the virtual exchange of phonons or lattice cups

 He was the chief commander in Akbar's army

 The great historian Colonel James Tod has written- "mansingh, the heir of Bhagwan Das, was given the best position in the court of Akbar
 

maansingh ne urisa or assam ko jeet kar unako badshaah akbar ke adheen bana diya
 raja maansingh se bhaybheet ho kar kabul ko bhi akbar kii adheenta sweekaar kerani paddy thi
 As a result of these actions, Mansingh was appointed as the ruler of Bengal, Bihar, South and Kabul
 " When Akbar's general Man Singh Solapur was returning after conquering Maharashtra, Mansingh thought of meeting Pratap

 Maharana Pratap had to manage his welcome on the sails of Udaisagar in Udaipur after passing his kingdom within Mewar
 After the reception and mutual interaction, it was time for lunch
 maharaja maansingh bhojan ke liye aaye kintu maharana ko na dekh kar aashcharya main pad gayi
 When he asked Maharana's son Amarsingh for this reason, he told that 'maharana saheb has a headache, so he is unable to support you on food
 ' According to some historians, this incident also became the reason for the battle of Haldi valley
 akbar ko rana pratap ke is vyavhaar ke kaaran mewar par akraman karne kaa ek or mauka mil gaya
 In 1576 AD, he was set on a campaign to punish Maharana Pratapsingh

 It also had Akbar's tremendous artillery with Mughal, Rajput and Pathan warriors

 Rana Pratap fought that huge Mughal army with a handful of soldiers
 haldi ghati kii pili bhoomi raktranjit ho uthi
 On June 21, 1576 AD, seventeen thousand soldiers were killed in this fierce battle of one day between Pratap and the Mughal army in the Haldi valley near Gogunda
 yaheen rana pratap or maansingh kaa aamanaa-saamana hone par donon ke bich vikat yuddh hua - chetak kii peeth par savaar pratap ne akbar ke senapati maansingh ke hathi ke mastak par kaale-nile rang ke, arabi nasl ke ashv chetak ke paanv jamaa die or apane bhaale se sidhaa raja maansingh par ek pralayankari waar kiya, par tatkaal apane hathi ke majboot haude main chipak kar neeche baith jane se is yuddh main unki jaan batch gayi- houdah pratap ke durgharsh waar se buree tarah mud gaya
 Later, when Rana Pratap went away from the battleground of Haldighati on serious injuries, King Mansingh reached his palace and sent one of Pratap's famous elephant elephant Ramprasad to agra-darbar with other loot
 parantu maansingh ne chittorgarh ke nagar ko luutane kii ajna nahin di thi, yah jaan kar badshaah akbar in par kaaphi kupit hua or kuch vaqt ke liye darbar main inke aane par pratibandh tak laga diya
 In the words of James Todd- "in the days when Akbar was horribly ill and feared to die, Mansingh Khusro had laid a web of conspiracies to place him on the Mughal throne
 

uski yah cheshtaa darbar main sab ko gyaat ho gayi or vah bengal kaa shaasha bana kar bhej diya gaya
 After he left Khusro was imprisoned and kept in prison
 maansingh chatur or doordarshee tha
 He secretly supported Khusro
 Mansingh had an army of twenty thousand Rajputs under his control

 kuch itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he- "akbar ne das karod rupee de kar maansingh ko apane anukool bana liya tha
 " akbar shashan main jab raja bhagwantdas punjab ke soobedaar niyat hue, tab sindh ke paar seemaant praant kaa shashan unke kunwar maansingh ko diya gaya
 When Akbar's half-brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim died in his 30th year, Mansingh swiftly arrived in Kabul and got the residents there to get rid of the looting that followed the demise of the ruler and his sons Mirza Afrasiyab and Mirza Kankuvad of the kingdom
 He came to the court with other warlords

 raja bhagavaandas kii mrityu ho jane par raja maansingh jaipur ke singhaasana par baitha
 karnal james tod ne likhaa he- "maansingh ke shasankaal main amer rajya ne badi unnati kii
 mogul darbar main sammanit ho kar maansingh ne apane rajya kaa vistaar kiya usne anek rajyon par akraman kar ke jo aparimit sampatti luti thi, uske dwaara amer rajya ko shaktishaalee bana diya
 dhaularai ke baad amer, jo ek maamuli rajya samajha jaataa tha, maansingh ke samay vahi ek shaktishaalee or vistrut rajya ho gaya tha
 In the history of India, the Kachhwahs were not considered as knights, but during the time of King Bhagwan Das and Mansingh, the Kachwaha people showed their strength, might and glory from Khutan to the sea
 maansingh yon akbar kii adheenta main zarur tha, par uske saath kaam karne vaali rajput sena, badshaah kii sena se kahin adhik shaktishaalee samajhi jaati thi"
 Some other historians do not agree with this about Colonel James Tod
 His statement is that Mansingh was not the adopted son of Bhagwan Das, but he was the son of Bhagwant Das
 bhagavaandas or bhagwant das donon bhai the
 Mughal-history books reveal that on the orders of Akbar, his experienced officers Maharaja Mansingh, local subedar Qutubuddin Khan and Raja Bhagwant Das of Amer made a lot of research to capture Maharana Pratap in the forests of Gogunda and Mewar but eventually failed Akbar became very angry - even in the year 1577, both of them were 'locked up' diyodhi! " "muslim itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he hijri 1024 san 1615 isvi main maansingh kii bengal main mrityu hui, parantu duusare itihaaskaaron ke vivaran se pataa chalata he ki maansingh uttar kii taraf khilji badshaah se yuddh karne gaya tha jahaan vah san 1617 isvi main maaraa gaya
 


 After Mansingh's death, his son Bhavsingh ascended the throne

 Management includes organizing, organization-building, staffing, leadership, and controlling the organization or initiative
 sanghathan bhale hi bada ho yaa chota, laabh ke liye ho athwa gaiyr-laabh vaala, seva pradaan karata ho athwa vinirmaankarta, prabandh sabhi keliye aavashyak he
 Management is necessary so that individuals can make their best contribution towards the accomplishment of collective objectives
 prabandh main parsparik rup se sambandhit vah kaary sammilit hai jinhen sabhi prabandhak karte hai
 Managers spend different time on different tasks
 sanghathan ke ucchstar par baithe prabandhak niyojan evam sanghathan par neeche str ke prabandhakon kii tulana main adhik samay lagaate hai
 Many authors have given the definition of management
 prabandh shabd ek bahuprachlit shabd he jise sabhi prakaar kii kriyaaon ke liye vyapak rup se prayukt kiya gaya he
 By the way, it is mainly used for various activities of any enterprise
 uparokt udhaaharan evam vastusthiti ke adhyayan se yah spasht ho gaya hoga ki prabandh vah kriya he jo har us sanghathan main aavashyak he jisamen log samooh ke rup main kaary kar rahe hai
 People do different types of tasks in the organization but they still work to achieve the same purpose
 prabandh logon ke prayatnon evam samaan uddeshy ko praapt karne main disha pradaan karata he
 In this way, the management sees that the tasks are completed and the targets are achieved, at least at the least cost and minimum cost
 atah prabandh ko paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he ki yah uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se praapt karne ke uddeshy se kaaryon ko puraa karaane kii prakriya he
 We need to analyze this definition
 kuch shabd aise hai jinka vistaar se varnan karnaa aavashyak he
 These words are- paribhaasha main prayukt prakriya se abhipraay he praathmik kaary athwa kriyaayein jinhen prabandh kaaryon ko puraa karaane ke liye karata he
 These tasks are - planning, organization, appointment, direction and control which will be discussed further in this chapter and in the book
 prabhavi athwa kaary ko prabhavi dhang se karne kaa vastav main abhipraayah die gaye kaary ko sampann karnaa he
 Effective management is about doing the right thing, completing actions and achieving objectives
 duusare shabdon main, iskaa kaary antim parinaam praapt karnaa he
 But just completing the work is not enough, there is another aspect of it and that is efficiency ie doing the work efficiently
 kushalta kaa arth he kaary ko sahi dhang se nunatam laagat par karnaa
 There is a kind of cost-benefit analysis and the relation between input and output
 yadi kam sadhano kaa upyog kar adhik laabh praapt karte hai to ham kahenge ki kshamta main vruddhi hui he
 Efficiency will be increased if less resources are used for the same benefit or output and less cost is incurred
 aagat saadhan ve hai jo kisi kaary vishesh ko karne ke liye aavashyak dhan, maal upkaran evam maanav sansaadhan hon
 Naturally, management is related to the efficient use of these resources because they reduce costs and in the end they increase profits
 yah donon shabd alag-alag hote hue bhi ek duusare se sambandhit hai
 It is important to have both effective and efficient management
 prabhaavapurntaa evam kaushal donon ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 But balance between these two sides is necessary and sometimes management has to compromise efficiency
 udhaaharan ke liye prabhaavapurn hona evam kushalta kii andekhi karnaa saral he jiskaa arth he kaary ko puraa karnaa lekin unchi laagat par
 For example, suppose a company aims to produce 8,000 units in a year
 is lakshya ko paane ke liye adhikansh samay bijli na milane par prabandhak prabhavotpadak to tha lekin kshamtawan nahin tha kyonki, usee nirgat ke liye adhik aagat kaa upyog kiya gaya
 Sometimes business focuses more on the production of goods with less resources, ie reduced the cost but failed to produce the scheduled production
 parinamswaroop maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya isliye isaki maang kam ho gai tathaa iskaa sthaan pratiyogiyon ne le liya
 This is a situation of lack of efficiency but effectiveness as the goods did not reach the market
 isliye nunatam laagat par prabandhak liye lakshyon ko praapt karnaa adhik mahatvapurn he
 For this, balance has to be made in effectiveness and efficiency
 saadharantaya ucch kaary kushalta ke saath ucch prabhaavapurntaa hoti he jo ki sabhi prabandhakon kaa lakshya hota he
 But unduly emphasizing high work efficiency without effectiveness is also undesirable
 kamjor prabandhan prabhaavapurntaa evam kaarykushal dona kii kami ke kaaran hota he
 After studying some definitions, we get to know some elements which we call the basic features of management
 prabandh kuch uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye kaary karata he
 Objectives are the expected results of any action
 inhen vyavsaay ke mul prayojan se praapt kiya janaa chahie
 Any organization has different objectives and management has to achieve all these objectives effectively and efficiently
 uddeshyon ko sanghathanaatmak uddeshy, saamaajik uddeshy evam vyaktigat uddeshyon main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The management is responsible for determining and accomplishing the objectives for the organization
 ise sabhi kshetren ke anek prakaar ke uddeshyon ko praapt karnaa hota he tathaa sabhi hitarthiyon jaise-anshadhari, karmchaaree, graahak, sarkaar aadi ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhana hota he
 The main objective of any organization should be to utilize human and material resources for maximum possible benefit
 jiskaa taatpary he vyavsaay ke aarthik uddeshyon ko puraa karnaa
 These objectives are - to keep oneself alive, to earn profit and to grow
 kisi bhi vyavsaay kaa aadharbhoot uddeshy apane astitv ko banaae rakhana hota he
 Management should strive towards the survival of the organization
 iske liye sanghathan ko paryaapt dhan kamanaa chahie jisase ki laagton ko puraa kiya ja sake
 It is not enough for business to survive
 prabandh ko yah sunishchit karnaa hota he ki sanghathan laabh kamaaye
 Profit serves as an important impetus for the continued successful operation of the enterprise
 laabh vyavsaay kii laagat evam jokhimon ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak hota he
 Increasing your prospects in the long term is very important for the business
 iske liye vyavsaay kaa badhanaa bahut mahatva rakhata he
 Management should take full advantage of the potential of organization development to remain in the industry
 vyavsaay ke vikaas ko vikray aavart, karmchaariyon kii sankhya main vruddhi yaa phir utpaadon kii sankhya yaa poonji ke nivesh main vruddhi aadi ke rup main mapa ja saktaa he
 Creating benefits for society
 sanghathan chaahe vyavsaayik he athwa gaiyr vyavsaayik, samaaj ke ang hone ke kaaran use kuch saamaajik dayitvon ko puraa karnaa hota he
 This means creating favorable economic values for different parts of society
 isamen sammilit hai- utpaadan ke paryaavaran bhinn paddati apnaanaa, samaaj ke logon se vanchit virgon ko rojgaar ke avasar pradaan karnaa evam karmchaariyon ke liye vidhyalay, shishugrih jaisi suvidhaayen pradaan karnaa
 The box further gives an example of an organization fulfilling a corporate social responsibility
 sanghathan un logon se milakar banataa he jinase unka vyaktitv, prishthbhumi, anubhav evam uddeshy alag-alag hote hai
 All these become part of the organization to satisfy their diverse needs
 yah pratiyogi vetan evam anya laabh jaisi vittiya aavashyaktaaon se lekar saathiyon dwaara manyata jaisi saamaajik aavashyaktaaon evam vyaktigat badhotaree evam vikaas jaisi ucch stareey aavashyaktaaon ke rup main alag-alag hoti hai
 Management has to match individual objectives with organizational objectives to align with the organization
 prabandh ek saarvbhaumik kriya he jo kisi bhi sanghathan kaa abhinn ang he
 Now we will study some of the reasons why management has become so important- prabandh itnaa hi purana he jitani kii sabhyataa
 Although the origin of modern organization is new, but organized work has been taking place since ancient times of civilization
 vastav main sanghathan ko vishisht lakshan mana ja saktaa he jo sabhy samaaj ko asabhy samaaj se alag karata he
 The early practices of management were the rules and laws that emerged from the experience of government and commercial activities
 vyapaar evam vaanijya ke vikaas se kramshah prabandh ke siddhant evam vyavhaaron kaa vikaas hua
 The word 'prabandha' is used today in many meanings which highlight various aspects of its nature
 prabandh ke adhyayan kaa vikaas beete samay main aadhunik sanghathanon ke saath-saath hua he
 It has been based on both the experience and behavior of managers and the associated set of principles
 beete samay main iskaa ek gatisheel vishay ke rup main vikaas hua he
 Which has its own special characteristics
 lekin prabandh kii prakruti se sambandhit ek prashn kaa uttar dena aavashyak he ki prabandh vigyaan he yaa kala he yaa phir donon he? iskaa uttar dene ke liye aaie vigyaan evam kala donon kii visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen tathaa dekhen ki prabandh kahan tak inaki purti karata he
 What is art Art is the personal and efficient use of current knowledge to achieve desired results
 ise adhyayan, avlokan evam anubhav se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Now, because art is concerned with personal use of knowledge, a kind of originality and creativity is required to put into practice the fundamental principles studied
 kala ke aadharbhoot lakshan is prakaar hai- Art assumes that there is some theoretical knowledge already
 visheshgyon ne apane-apane kshetron main kuch moolbhoot siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he jo ek vishesh prakaar kii kala main prayukt hota he
 For example, literature on dance, public address / speech, art or music is acceptable
 is moolbhoot gyaan kaa upyog vyakti, vyakti ke anusaar alag-alag hota he
 Art is, therefore, a very personal concept
 udhaaharan ke liye do nartak, do vaktaa, do kalakaar athwa do lekhakon kii apni kala ke pradarshan main bhinnata hogi
 All art is practical
 kala vartmaan siddhanton ko gyaan kaa rachanaatmak upyog he
 We know that music is based on seven notes
 lekin kisi sangeetkaar kii sangeet rachana vishisht athwa bhinn hoti he yah is baat par nirbhar karti he ki in suron kaa kis prakaar se sangeet srijan main prayog kiya gaya he, jo ki uski apni vyakhya hoti he
 Management is an art because, it fulfills the following characteristics- prabandhak ek krambaddh gyaan-samooh he kinhin saamaanya satya athwa saamaanya siddhanton ko spasht karata he vigyaan kii moolbhoot visheshtaayen nimna hai- Science is a hierarchical set of knowledge
 iske siddhant kaaran evam parinaam ke bich main sambandh aadhaarit hai
 For example, the occurrence of the apple falling from the tree to Earth gives rise to the principle of gravity
 vaigyanik siddhanton ko pehle avlokan ke madhyam se viksit kiya jaataa he or phir niyantrit paristhitiyon main baar-baar pareekshan kar uski jaanch kii jaati he
 Scientific theories are universal for validity and application
 uparyukt visheshtaon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai prabandh vigyaan ke rup main kuch visheshtaon ko dhaaran karata he- It is necessary to manage all types of organization processes
 aapane yah bhi avlokan kiya hoga ki sanghathanon ko unka prabandh karne ke liye kuch vishisht yogyataon evam anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 You may have also noticed that on the one hand there has been an increase in the corporate form and on the other hand more emphasis is being placed on managing the business
 kya iskaa arth yah hua ki prabandh ek pesha he? is prashn kaa uttar jaanane ke liye aaie peshey kii pramukh visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen evam dekhen ki kya prabandh inako puraa karata he
 The following are the characteristics of the profession sabhi peshey bhalee-bhanti paribhaashit gyaan ke samooh par aadhaarit hote hai jise shiksha se arjeet kiya ja saktaa he
 Admission to the profession is limited by examination or educational qualification
 udhaaharan ke liye bharat main yadi kisi ko chartered accountint bananaa he to use bhartiya chartered accountint santhaan dwaara yojit kii jane vaali ek vishesh pariksha ko paas karnaa hoga
 All professions are associated with one or the other councils, which regulate their entry, issue certificates to work and prepare and implement the Aadhaar Code
 bharat main vakaalat karne ke liye vakeelon ko baar council kaa sadsy bananaa hota he jo unke kaaryon kaa niyaman evam niyantran karata he
 All professions are bound by a code of conduct that gives direction to the behavior of their members
 udhaaharan ke liye jab doctor apane peshey main pravesh karte hai to vah apane kaary naitikta kii shapath lete hai
 The basic purpose of the profession is loyalty and commitment and the interests of its customers
 ek vakil yah sunishchit karata he ki uske muvakkil ko nyaay mili
 Management does not fully meet the principles of the profession
 vaise isamen kuch visheshtaayen hoti hai jo nimna hai- Management is a universal term used in a group of relationships in an enterprise by people connected to each other to perform certain tasks
 prayek-vyakti kaa sambandhon kii is shrunkhlaa main kisi na kisi kaary vishesh ko puraa karne kaa uttardaayitv hota he
 In order to fulfill this responsibility, he is given some rights ie decision making authority
 adhikaar evam uttardaayitv kaa yah sambandh vyaktiyon ko adhikari evam adhinsth ke rup main ek duusare ko bandhate hai
 This creates different levels in the organization
 kisi sanghathan ke adhikaar shrunkhlaa main teen str hote hai- High Level Management - These are the senior most executive officers of the organization who are called by many names
 yah saamanytah chairman, mukhya kaaryakari adhikari, mukhya prachaalan adhikari, pradhan, uppradhan aadi ke naam se jane jate hai
 High management is a team of managers of different functional levels
 unka mul kaary sanghathan ke kul uddeshyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vibhinn tatwon main ekta evam vibhinn vibhaagon ke kaaryon main saamanjasy sthapit karnaa he
 These high level managers are responsible for the welfare and continuity of the organization
 form ke jivan ke liye ye vyavsaay ke paryaavaran evam uske prabhaav kaa vishleshan karte hai
 They formulate the goals and armaments of the new organization for their achievement
 vyavsaay ke sabhi kaaryon evam unke samaaj par prabhaav ke liye ye hi uttaradaayi hote hai
 The task of higher management is complex and stressful
 isamen lanbaa samay lagata he to sanghathan ke prati purnapatibaddhta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Middle level management- These are the link between upper managers and lower level, they are subordinate to upper managers and heads of first linear managers
 inhen saamanytah vibhaag pramukh, parichaalan prabandhak athwa sanyantr adheekshak kehete hai
 Middle level managers are responsible for the implementation of control plans and armaments developed by higher management
 iske saath-saath ye pratham rekhiy prabandhakon ke sabhi kaaryon ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 Their main task is to complete the plans prepared by the higher level managers
 iske liye Supervisory or Operations Manager - Foremen and supervisors come at the lower level in the authority line of the organization
 paryvekshak kaarybal ke kaaryon kaa pratyaksh rup se avlokan karte hai
 Their rights and duties are determined by schemes made by higher managers
 paryvekshan, prabandhakon kii sanghathan main mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he kyonki yah sidhe vaastavik kaary bal se samvaad karte hai evam madhya stareey prabandhakon ke dishanirdeshon ko karmchaariyon tak pahunchaate hai
 By these efforts, the quality of the product is maintained, the loss of goods is kept to a minimum and the level of safety is maintained
 kaarigari kii gunvattta, evam utpaadan kii maatr karmchaariyon ke parishram, anushaasan evam swamibhakti par nirbhar karti he
 Management is considered as the process of planning, organization, direction and control of tasks from members to the organization and the use of resources of the organization for achieving the set objectives
 yah pehle se hi yah nirdhaarit karne kaa kaary he ki kya karnaa he, kis prakaar tathaa kisko karnaa he
 This means setting objectives in advance and setting a path to achieve them efficiently and effectively
 suhasini ke sanghathan kaa uddeshy he paramparaagat bhartiya hathkargha evam hastshilp kii vastuon ko kharidkar unhen bechnaa
 He sells woven garments, decoration items, garments and household articles made from traditional Indian clothes
 suhasini inaki maatr, inke vibhinn prakaar, rang evam banaavat ke sambandh main nirnay leti he phir vibhinn aapurtikartaaon se unke kray athwa unke ghar main taiyaar karaane par sansadhano kaa aavanton karti he
 No one can prevent planning problems from occurring, but they can be anticipated and they can form contingency plans whenever they arise
 yah nirdhaarit yojana ke kriyanvayan ke liye kaary saunpane, kaaryon ko samoohon main baantne, adhikaar nishchit karne evam sansadhano ke aavanton ke kaary kaa prabandhan karata he
 Once a specific plan is prepared to meet the objectives of the organization, then the organization will examine the actions and resources necessary for the implementation of the plan
 yah aavashyak kaaryon evam sansadhano kaa nirdhaaran karegaa
 It decides who will do what work, where it will be done and when
 sanghathan main aavashyak kaaryon ko prabandh ke yogya vibhaag evam kaary ikaiyon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he evam sanghathan kii adhikaar shrunkhlaa main adhikaar evam vivaran dene ke sambandhon kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Appropriate techniques of organization help in completion of work and promotion of operational efficiency and effectiveness completion of results
 vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon ko kaary kii prakruti ke anusaar bhinn-bhinn dhaanchon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 You will read more about this in further chapters
 saral shabdon main iskaa arth he sahi kaary ke liye uchit vyakti ko foondnaa
 An important aspect of management is to ensure that the right people with the right qualifications are available at the right place and time to achieve the objectives of the organization
 ise maanav sansaadhan kaary bhi kehete hai tathaa isamen karmchaariyon kii bhartee, chayan, kaary par niyukti evam prashikshan sammilit hai
 Infosys Technology, which develops software, requires system analysts and programmers, while Labmart requires a team of designers and craftspeople
 nideshan kaa kaary karmchaariyon ko netritv pradaan karnaa, prabhavit karnaa evam abhiprerit karnaa he jisase ki vah supurd kaary ko puraa kar saken
 This requires creating an environment that inspires employees to function optimally
 abhiprerana evam netritv-nirdesan ke do mul tatv hai
 Motivating employees simply means creating an environment that motivates them to work
 netritv kaa arth he dusron ko is prakaar se prabhavit karnaa, ki vah apane netaa ke icchit kaary sampann karen
 a good manager, with the help of praise and criticism, directs in such a way that employees can contribute their best
 suhasini ke dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii chaadaron ke liye silk par bhadkile rangon ke chaape viksit kiye
 Although it looked very attractive, but due to the use of silk, it was very expensive for the common man
 unke kaary kii prashansa karte hue suhasini ne unhen suzav diya ki in silk kii chaadaron ko vah deepawali, christmas jaise vishesh avasaron ke liye sahej kar rakhen tathaa unhen niyamit rup se sooti vastren par chhaapen
 Control is defined as the act of managing in which it directs the execution of organization work to achieve the goals of the organization
 niyantran kaary main nishpaadan ke str nirdhaarit kiye jate hai, vartmaan nishpaadan ko mapa jaataa he
 It is matched to predefined levels and corrective steps are taken in the event of deviation
 iske liye prabandhakon ko yah nirdhaarit karnaa hoga ki safalataa ke liye kya kaary evam utpaadan mahatvapurn hai, uskaa kaise or kahan maapan kiya ja saktaa he tathaa sudharatmak kadam uthaane ke liye koun adhikrut he
 When Suhasini found that his team of designers made a bed sheet that was more expensive than the fixed price for his sale, he changed the cloth for the sheet to control costs
 prabandhak ke vibhinn kaaryon par saadharantaya uparokt kram main hi charchaa kii jaati he jiske anusaar ek prabandhak pehle yojana taiyaar karata he; phir sanghathan banaata he; tatpashchaat nirdesan karata he; or ant main niyantran karata he
 In fact the manager rarely performs these tasks one by one
 prabandhak ke kaary ek duusare se jude hai tathaa yah nishchit karnaa kathin ho jaataa he koun-sa kaary kahan samaapt hua tathaa koun-sa kaary kahan se prarambh hua
 In the process of managing an organization, a manager has to perform five tasks related to each other
 sanghathan ek aisi paddati he jo ek duusare se jude evam ek duusare par aadhaarit upapaddatiyon se bani he
 The manager has to connect these different groups to achieve the same objectives
 vibhinn vibhaagon kii gatividhiyon kii ekaatmakataa kii prakriya ko samanvay kehete hai
 Coordination is the power that binds all other functions of management to each other
 yah aisa dhaagaa he jo sanghathan ke kaary main nirantarata banaae rakhane ke liye kray, utpaadan, vikray evam vitt jaise sabhi kaaryon ko piroe rakhata he
 Coordination is sometimes considered a separate function of management
 lekin yah prabandh kaa saar he kyonki yah samuhik lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kiye gaye vyaktigat prayatnon main ekta laata he
 Each managerial task is an activity that contributes to the coordination in itself
 samanvay kisi bhi sanghathan ke sabhi kaaryon main lakshith evam anternihit hai
 The process of coordinating the actions of the organization starts with planning
 ucch prabandh puure sanghathan ke liye yojana banaata he
 According to these plans organization structures are developed and employees are appointed
 yojanaon kaa kriyanvayan yojana ke anusaar hi yah sunishchit karne ke liye nirdesan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If there is any difference between the actual actions and their achievements, it is resolved at the time of control
 samanvay kii kriya ke madhyam se prabandh kaa samaan uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon main ekta ko sunishchit karne ke liye vyaktigat evam samuhik prayatnon kii sahi vyavastha karata he, samanvay sanghathan kii vibhinn ikaayiyon ke bhinn-bhinn kaaryon evam prayatnon main ekta sthapit karata he
 It provides the required amount of effort, quantity, time and serialization that ensures the minimum attainment of planned objectives
 uparokt paribhaashaon se samanvay kii nimna visheshtaayen spasht hoti hai- Co-ordination brings togetherness in collective work - Coordination brings interests that are not related to each other or different from each other, unity in objective work activity
 yah samooh ke kaaryon ko ek kendra bindu pradaan karata he jo yah sunishchit karata he ki nishpaadan yojana evam nirdhaarit kaarykram ke anusaar ho
 Coordination brings unity in action - The objective of coordination is to bring unity in action to achieve the same objectives
 yah vibhinn vibhaagon ko jodne kii shakti kaa kaary karata he tathaa yah sunishchit karata he ki sabhi kriyaayein sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kii jaaen
 You found that the production and sales departments of Labmart have to coordinate their work so that production can be done as per the market demand
 samanvay nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he- samanvay koi ek baar kaa kaary nahin he balki ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 It starts with planning and runs till control
 suhasini thand ke samay ke liye vastren ke sambandh main june ke maheene main hi yojana bana leti he
 She then arranges for an adequate workforce
 utpaadan yojana ke anusaar hi iske liye lagaataar nigaraanee rakhti he use apane vipanan vibhaag ko samay rahete bataanaa hoga ki vah vikray pravartan evam vigyaapan ke prachaar ke liye taiyaar karen
 Coordination is a universal task - the actions of different departments depend on each other by nature, hence coordination is required at all levels of management
 yah vibhinn vibhaagon evam vibhinn staron ke kaaryon main ekta sthapit karata he
 Suhasini has to coordinate the works of the purchasing, production and sales departments in order to achieve opposition to the organization's purpose
 kray vibhaag kaa kaary kapadaa khareednaa he
 This becomes the basis for the activities of the production department and finally the sale becomes possible
 yadi kapadaa ghatiya gunvattta vaala he yaa phir utpaadan vibhaag dwaara nirdhaarit vishistataaen liye hue nahin he to isse aage kii bikri kam ho jaaegi
 If there is no coordination, there will be repetition and chaos in place of unity and integration in actions
 samanvay sabhi prabandhakon kaa uttardaayitv he- kisi bhi sanghathan main samanvay prayek prabandhak kaa kaary he ucch str ke prabandhak yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki sanghathan kii nitiyon kaa kriyanvayan ho, apane adhinsthon ke saath samanvay karte hai
 Middle-level managers coordinate with both upper-level managers and first-line managers
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki kaary yojanaon ke anusaar kiya jaae, prachaalan str ke prabandhak apane karmchaariyon ke kaaryon main samanvay karte hai
 Coordination is a thought-provoking task - a manager has to coordinate the actions of different people carefully and thoughtfully
 kisi vibhaag main sadsy swechha se ek duusare se sahyog karte hue kaary karte hai, samanvay is sahyog kii bhaavana ko dishanirdesh detaa he
 In the absence of coordination, cooperation will also prove fruitless and coordination without cooperation will lead to dissatisfaction among the employees
 isliye ham kah sakate hai ki samanvay, prabandh kaa pruthak se ek kaary nahin he balki yah uskaa saar he
 If an organization wants to achieve its objectives effectively and efficiently, it will require coordination
 maala main dhaage ke samaan hi samanvay prabandh ke sabhi kaaryon kaa abhinn ang he
 Integrating various managerial functions ensures adequate coordination among individuals and departments
 jaise samanvay kii samasya ke paidaa hone ke kaaran bade paimaane ke sanghathan main antarnihit nirantar parivartan kamjor athwa niskriy netritv evam jatiltaayen hai
 Coordinating these kinds of complexities in large organizations requires special efforts
 sanghathan kaa aakaar-bade sanghathanon main lage badi sankhya main log samanvay kii samasya ko jatil bana dete hai
 Each person is unique in itself
 tathaa apni evam sanghathan kii aavashyaktaaon ko mahasoos karata he
 Each has his / her own working habits, his / her background, proposals / ways of dealing with situations and relationships with others
 vaise ek akelaa vyakti sadaa budhimaani se kaary nahin karata he
 His behavior is neither always well understood nor fully predictable
 isliye sanghathan kii kaary kushalta ke liye yah anivaary he ki vyakti evam samooh ke uddeshyon ko samanvay dwaara ekikrut kar diya jaae
 Functional Differentiation - The functions of the organization are repeatedly divided into departments, divisions, sections etc
 samanvay kii samasya isliye paidaa hoti he kyonki adhikaar kshetren kaa drudhikaran ho jaataa he or unke bich ke avarohak or bhi adhik majboot ho jate hai
 Many times this is because the classification of tasks is not tactical or the managers do not follow a logical path, but take the path of experience
 aise maamalon main sanghathan main prabhavi dhang se kaary karne ke liye samanvay aavashyak he
 Specialization - There is a high degree of specialization in modern organizations
 vishishtikaran kaa janm aadhunik takneekon kii jatiltaaon tathaa kaaryon evam inhen karne waalon kii vividhta ke kaaran hota he
 Experts think that they are capable of testing each other on the basis of profession but other people may not have any adequate basis for such a decision
 yadi visheshgyon ko bina samanvay ek bhumandaleey prabandhak ke saamne chunauti ke kaary karne kii anumati de di jaae to parinaam kaaphi manhage honge
 That is why a composition mechanism is needed to coordinate the work of various experts engaged in the organization
 samanvay prabandh kaa saar he
 This is not something a manager may order
 balki yah to vah cheez he jise ek prabandhak niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nirdesan niyantran kaaryon ko karte hue praapt karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Hence each task is a practice of coordination
 sanghathan evam inke prabandh main parivartan aa rahaa he
 As the boundaries of different cultures and countries are getting blurred and new technologies of communication can be considered as a global village
 antarrashtriya evam antar samskruti sambandh bhi teji se bad rahe hai
 Today's organization is a global organization that is managed in the global scenario
 saransh main kah sakate hai ki ek vaishvik prabandhak vah he jiske paas ‘hard’ evam ‘soft’ donon prakaar kaa kaushal hai
 Managers who have knowledge of analyzing, analyzing, engineering and technology are still needed today, but how teams work in individuals, how organizations work and how they can motivate people for worldwide success
 It is very important to have understanding of everyone
 udhaaharan ke liye jo prabandhak vibhinn samskritiyon main paith rakhata he vah pashchimi europe, gaiyr angreji bolne vaale desh main kaary kar saktaa he phir malaysia athwa kenya jaise vikasshil deshon main ja saktaa he or phir use neuyark, you- es- e- ke karyaalay main hastantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 He will be able to work effectively at these three places immediately
 vaishvik prabandhak kii bhoomika kaa vikaas usee prakaar se hua he jis prakaar se vaishvik udyog evam arthvyavastha kaa vikaas hua he
 It has transformed from a one-dimensional role to a multi-faceted role in the context of a defined occupation which requires a combination of technical skills, soft management and skills and learning and learning of different cultures
