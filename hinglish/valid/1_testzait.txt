pracheen unani sabhyataa se lekar beesvin sadi tak is vichaar kii ruparekha main kai baar jabardast parivartan ho chuke hai
 Many thinkers have contributed to its development and changes in it, including Aristotle, Hobbes, Rousseau, Marx and Tocveil
 samanta kisi had tak aadhunik avadharana he
 Today, human society has not always felt the need for equality between man and man
 pashchimi duniya main raajaaon ko raaj karne kaa daivi adhikaar praapt mana jaataa tha or aisa hi apane-apane kshetron kii had tak samant shrimanton ke sambandh main bhi samajha jaataa tha
 On the other hand, the clergy believed that no one else could be the same as they are omniscient
 unani kaal main samanta sthapit karne kii simit or bahut kamjor koshish hi kii gai
 Eventually, in the seventeenth century, the demand for rights and freedom began to arise in Europe and equality was demanded in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
 aarambh main yah maang vyapaariyon tathaa vyavsaayiyon main se nav-dhanadhyon ne yaa burjua ne kii, jinka kahana tha ki jab samant shrimanton or raajaaon ke saath-saath unke paas bhi sampatti or aarthik rutva he tab unka kanoonee darja unki barabari kaa kyon nahin he
 For example, in Twain's words, the situation in England was of the following manner: ‘chunki asamantaaon main sabase khaas aarthik nahin balki kanoonee asamantaayein thim isliye sampatti kii asamanta nahin balki kanoonee visheshadhikaar par sabase pehle prahaar kiya gaya
 


 The primary goal of the reformers was to achieve legal equality, as it was thought that economic equality would be established automatically to the desired extent after it was achieved
 ’ Similarly, the issue in France was not legal equality, but legal rights, and the struggle for equality distinguished the 'new elite based on property at the level of the old elite based on land
 ’ The eighteenth century primarily voiced legal and political equality, and finally the rise of the new working class in the nineteenth century resulted in a more vigorous demand for social equality
 unnisvin sadi main nirbandh poonjeewaad ke badhate kadam ne ek ore to kuch pariwaron ke liye dhan kaa ambara laga diya lekin saath hi duusari ore baari garibi or aarthik asamanta ko janm diya
 Hence the demand for economic equality arose and this was done by humanists, idealistic socialists and positive liberals
 aarthik samanta kii yah maang nakaaratmak raajnneetik or kanoonee samanta ke liye nahin, balki sakaaratmak samanta ke liye thi or isamen nijee sampatti par ankush, amiron dwaara garibon ke shoshan par roak kaa samavesh tha or iskaa arth tha samaaj kii samgr aarthik vyavastha ke sandarbh main rajya kii sakaaratmak bhoomika
 a very important milestone in the struggle for equality was that of women suffragists in the first half of the twentieth century, whose efforts resulted in the suffrage of women
 usee sadi main britain jaisi samrajyavaadee shaktiyon se mukti praapt karne ke liye bharat jaise upniveshon ke swatantraaa andolan faleebhoot hue, jisase samanta kii yatra ko or bhi gati mili
 The voice of each citizen was considered to be of equal value in the work of royalty in the Greek city-states, such as Athens and Sparta
 arestu ke athenian constitution main un samtamulak sudhaaron ke kai hawaale milte hai jinke aadhaar par loktantric adarsh kii aazamaaish kii ja saki
 The aim of these reforms was to reduce the inequalities in various spheres of social life so that the clans and feudal lords could be loosened on land ownership, power and social pride
 kanoon ke aadhaar par samanta kaa vyavhaar hi vah kasuti tha jiske aadhaar par loktantr ksaa ja saktaa tha
 But in ancient Athens, women, slaves and foreigners were also kept separate from this egalitarian realm
 arestu kii rachana politics main is bahirveshan kaa zikr bhi kiya he or use jaays bhi tehraaya he
 Equality for him meant equality of members of the class who were called citizens
 ve nyaay ko keval un logon ke liye uplabdh maanate the jo unki samanta ke daayre main aate the
 For those who were outside it, the situation of asymmetry was justified
 arestu kii buniyadi manyata thi ki prakruti ne logon ko shaasha or shasit main baant kar banaaya he
 To be in the category of ruler, it is essential for a person to be intelligent, reflective and possessing good news
 ve yah bhi maanate the ki yahi gun shaasha ko shasit se alag karte hai
 Criticizing Aristotle's notion of equality, Hobbes conceptualized the Prakrit state in his treatise Leviathan as equating every person under it
 bhale hi koi vyakti shaareerik shakti main yaa koi dimaagi tezi main duusare se kuch behatar ho, par kul mila kar manushyon ke bich aisa koi fark nahin hota jiske aadhaar par ve kisi vishesh laabh kii maang kar saken
 Hobbes argued that one who is weak in terms of body can plan and kill the powerful, and through experience at the level of the brain, each person is endowed with the ability to achieve the same sense of conscience
 isi ke saath manushya main satta hasil karne kii samaan aakanksha bhi hoti he jisase unke bich hode kaa janm hota he or prakritik samanta jokhimagrast ho jaati he
 Hobbes believed that by leaving a part of his power to political authority, only a person can lead a decent and equitable life
 arthath ek nishchit praadhikaar kaa prabhutv hi use puri suraksha kaa aashwaasan de saktaa he
 Hobbes believed that only through the liberation of all types of non-political authorities, including religion, can a person get his natural equality
 ruso bhi apane hisaab se ek prakrut-avasthaa kalpit karte hai
 He has divided it into natural and unnatural, considering heterogeneity rather than equality in his other discourse
 prakritik vishmata keval shaareerik shakti ke kshetra main hoti he
 However, lawmaking and property ownership have given rise to unnatural forms of asymmetry
 darasal, yah vishmata kaa pehla str he jisase garib or amir ke bich kaa fark paidaa hua he
 The second level is the institutional right to punish, leading to inequality of the powerful and the weak
 vishmata kaa aakiri str vaid satta ko svaichhik satta main badalane se paidaa hua he jisase ghulaam or maalik kii shreniyan paidaa hui hai
 Owners of property accumulate power and become owners, and the poor become weak and fall into slavery
 ruso ke mutabik is vishmata kii bhi ek seemaa he
 When an increase in inequality is no longer possible, new revolutions either destroy the rulers or they have to come close to the legitimate institutions of power
 marks ne apana samanta sambandhi vichaar udaarataavaadi samanta kii aalochana ke rup main viksit kiya
 They believed that the capitalist class uses the idea of equality in their own interest
 jis tarah ruso kehete the ki amiron ke jhuthe aashwaasano ke pher main fas kar garib unki satta kaa vaidhikaran karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai, usee tarah marks kehete hai ki shaasha varg apni vichaardhaara paidaa karata he taaki aarthik shoshan kii vyavastha jari rakhi ja sake
 There is a kind of division of work within the capitalist class
 ek hissaa poonji kaa swaamitv grahan karata he or doosraa vichaardhaaratmak auzaaron kaa istemaal karte hue samanta or swadhinata ke vichaaron ke zariye bhram kaa maahaul banaaye rakhata he
 According to Marx, in the feudal system, the place of ideas like pride and loyalty was the same place in capitalism, equality and freedom
 in amoort vichaaron kii prabhavakaarita itani adhik he ki kuch samaajawaadee bhi unke changul main fas jate hai
 However, these ideas are hollow and immaterial until they contain a communist vision
 marks ke anusaar shoshankari varg-sambandhon kii samaapti ke bina sthapit nahin kii ja sakati
 For this, he conceptualizes the first socialist phase, which will be based on giving each one according to his labor
 doosraa charan samyavaadee hoga jisamen har ek se uski kshamta ke anusaar or har ek ko uski kshamta ke anusaar dene kaa aadhaar grahan kiya jayega
 Investigating the American democratic revolution, talk of talk equality is a major trend in modern history
 america udhaaharan ke zariye ve samajhnaa chaahate the ki pashchimi samaaj ne samantvaad se loktantr kii taraf kis tarah sankraman kiya he
 They find the answer to the question why is the triumph of equality inevitable in the process? Why will social equality continue to develop? Talkweel says that the feudal system goes on to form a long chain from farmer to king
 par loktantr use tod kar shrunkhlaa kii har kadi ko mukt kar detaa he
 The desire to get out of the clutches of slavery and dependency increases the interest of the people in the idea of equality and thus creates the possibility of a democratic life
 tokvil ke anusaar loktantron main vyakti samanta ko azaadi ke upar bhi praathamikta dete hue uske jhande ko dridhtaa se thame rakhata he
 After these conclusions of the idea of equality, it is necessary to consider the question, what is the difference between equality and equality
 pariksha main baithne vaale har chaatr ko samaan ank nahin diye ja sakate
 Irrespective of family size, each one cannot be allotted same house
 pratibha or kshamta ko darkinar karte hue har vyakti kii aamadani samaan nahin kii ja sakati
 Therefore the appropriate criterion of equality should be something more than symmetry
 lekin, duusari taraf samarupata kaa mahatva nyaaypurna prakriyaaon ke liye ubharta he
 Procedures for bringing equality can be justified only when they are equal for all, such as equality of opportunities, equality of all in the eyes of law, etc
 samanta kii paribhaasha karnaa jaraa kathin he
 It is much more priceless than the idol
 zyaadaatar log ise achetan rup se un bhaavon se jodate hai jo ‘vahi’, ‘ek-jaisaa’, ‘nyyochit’ aadi shabdon se sampreshit hote hai

 Laski says, 'in the whole field of political science, no idea is more difficult than' equality '
 ’ Rousseau distinguished between natural and traditional inequalities
 prakruti-pradutt asamantaayein paaramparik asamantaayein hai
 Socialists and Marxists say that traditional inequalities, especially traditional economic inequalities, have so much power that they cover all natural inequalities
 marks kehete hai: The most influential positive thinker Laski described the following conditions as essential for equality: haal main bryan varnan ne samanta kii ek vyapak avadharana prastut karte hue sujhaayaa he ki samanta main nimnlikhit ghatak avadharanaon kaa samavesh hona chahieh Legal equality means equality before the law and equal protection of the law for all
 avadharana yah he ki sabhi manushya janm se samaan hote hai, isliye kanoon ke saamne samaan haisiyat ke paatr hai
 The law is blind and therefore no one will deal with the person he is dealing with
 vah budhimaan ho yaa murkh, tejasvi ko yaa budhu, nata ho yaa kaddavar, garib ho yaa amir, uske saath kanoon vaisaa hi vyavhaar karegaa jaisaa auron ke saath karegaa
 But there are also remedies
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi balak yaa balika ke saath kisi vayask purush yaa stri jaisaa vyavhaar nahin kiya jayega or balak yaa balika ke saath murauvat kiya jayega
 Political independence basically means universal suffrage and representative government
 saarvajaneen matadhikaar kaa matlab yah he ki sabhi vayaskon ko mat dene kaa adhikaar he or ek vyakti kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representative government means that everyone has the right to compete in elections without discrimination and stands for election to public service
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki sabhi ko mat dene ke liye vivash kiya ja saktaa he or prayek ko apni pasand jaahir kerani he yaa yadi kuch logon ko galat prabhaav daalkar matdaan karne se vimukh kar diya jaataa he yaa chaahe jise mat dene ke liye raji kar liya jaataa he to uske sambandh main rajya kuch khaas nahin kar saktaa or agar zyaadaatar log yaa kaaphi badi sankhya main log matdaan nahin karte or is prakaar sarkaar ke pratinidhik swaroop ko kamjor karte hai to raajnneetik samanta kii shuddh udaaravaadi samaj ke anusaar kisi prakaar kii raajnneetik asamanta kaa aarope bhi nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Merely technical or constitutionally guaranteed political equality also does not mean true political equality, as money power plays a major role in major liberal democracies
 jin logon, samoohon yaa virgon ke paas yah takat hoti he ve agar iskaa istemaal karne ko tatpar rahete hai to unhen apane raajnneetik hiton ko aage badhaane main isse itani zyada madad milti he ki uski kaat karnaa kathin hota he
 Thus the power of money alone usually plays a very important role in controlling the results of elections
 keval ummidavaaron or partiyon dwaara kharch kiya gaya paisa hi nahin balki paise ke sambandh kaa puraa tantra isamen madadgaar hota he
 Publicity media play a big role in today's liberal democracies, and especially in such democracies where a very large middle class exists, and although these mediums are considered independent, they cannot in fact be independent, because they For financial survival and prosperity, companies mainly rely on advertisements and for them business growth It is important to be sensitive to political sensibilities and interests and the agenda of companies
 jis had tak prachaar madhyam logon ko prabhavit karte hai us had tak ye kaary-suchiyaan un tak sampreshit ho jaati hai, chaahe yah kaam ve kisi sochi-samajhi yojana ke adheen karte hon yaa yon hi, yaa iske peeche unki majaburi ho yaa na ho
 Thus, the end result of this dissolves the level of level of political equality that would otherwise be practiced
 upar kahi gai baton ke alaava bharat jaise loktantr main shaktishaalee kaaryakari naukarshahiyaan or nyaayik sevaaon ke sadsy hote hai, jinhen raajnneetigyon kii tarah janata nahin chunati or agar log unase tang aa chuke hai to unka koi chunaav nahin hota ki ve unhen nikaal baahar karen
 Due to their educational and family background, members of these groups often come from the upper economic classes and classes and continue to influence policy making relentlessly and strongly
 jaahir he ki ye samooh anyon kii apeksha adhik raajnneetik samanta kaa upbhog karte hai
 For example, when a judge of the Supreme Court prohibits any policy legislation of the government and declares it unlawful, although the composition of that legislation is made by the elected representatives in free and fair elections, whether as illiterate as they are or To be educationally qualified, that is
 vah nyaayadhish kanoonee taur par to nahin lekin vishuddh raajnneetik drushtikon he spashtatah apane anya sah-nagarikon kii apeksha adhik shreshth samanta kii sthiti kaa upbhog kar rahaa hota he
 The notion of economic and social equality means different things to different people
 aarthik samanta se praarambhik udaarvaadiyon kaa taatpary keval yah tha ki har vyakti ko, uski paariwarik yaa aarthik sthiti chaahe jo ho, apana dhandha or pesha chunane kaa adhikaar he or prayek vyakti ko anubandh karne kii swatantraaa he, taaki jahaan tak anubandhatmak dayitvon kaa sambandh he, desh ke har vyakti ke saath samaan vyavhaar ho sake
 Gradually, the situation started to change in the direction of the notion that everyone should have equal opportunity to live as a full human being
 dhire-dhire yah samajha or sweekaar kiya jane laga ki samanta kaa matlab yah hona chahie ki samaaj main koi bhi itnaa garib na ho ki uske paas buniyadi aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke saadhan na hon or maansik tathaa shaareerik vikaas ke liye use praathmik avasar sulabh na hon
 In Rousseau's words, "by equality we should not mean that every person should have equal power and wealth, but it should mean that no citizen should be rich enough to buy others and someone Even a citizen should not be so poor that he is forced to sell

 Laski refined the positive liberal conception of economic equality, and the meaning of equality provided all things without which life is meaningless
 unhone kaha ki buniyadi aavashyaktaa kii vastuen to pariman or kism ke kisi bhed ke bina sabhi ke liye sulabh honi chahie

 sach to yah he ki ruso or kence jaise gaiyr-marxvaadi udaaravaadi chintakon ne bhi samanta or sampatti ke bich ke sambandh kaa nirdesh kiya he
 For example, Kense states: 'it is not easy for societies such as nomads and hunting tribes that have no use of private property to be egalitarian but societies that allow individuals to collect private property are not easy for them
 Happen
 ’ marxvaadi vishleshan main samanta keval virgon yaa varg-vibhajit samaaj ko mitaa kar hi praapt kii ja sakati he or uski purna prapti nijee sampatti ke unmoolan se hi sambhav he
 The Marxist idea is to establish a society in which there will be no private property or economic classes and each will be given what he has to pay according to the principle of 'work according to the qualifications and price as per requirement'
 vitaran kaa kaam rajya kaa he
 Lenin and other Marxists attack the positive liberal notion that economic inequalities can be eradicated by state intervention and that access to the basic necessities of life can be ensured for all, as they believe if private property If not eradicated, exploitation and inequalities will return slowly due to the power of money from the upper classes

 On the other hand, neo-liberal thinking - especially Milton Friedman and F
A
 The neo-liberal thought propounded by Heck - a very different rant about equality
 vah maanata he ki samanta or swatantraaa multah ek-duusare ke viruddh hai or isliye swatantraaa ke haq main asamanta ko sahan karnaa chahie or aaj duniya bhar main niti-nirdhaaran main - khaastaur se antarrashtriya mudra kosh or vishwa bank ke niti-nirdhaaran main is vichaar kaa jabardast bolbalaa he
 Neo-liberals also believe that tolerating inequality will ultimately prove to be of maximum benefit to the entire economy, as a result of which private economic activity will increase

 Swamiji practiced this in the early days of the twentieth century
 swamiji ke kathan ke anusaar ve sutara, jin par ‘vaidic ganit’ naamak unki kriti aadhaarit he, atharvaveda ke parishisht main aate hai
 But scholars have said that these sutras are not found in any appendix of the yet known Atharvaveda

 In fact today, Swamiji's work called 'vedic Mathematics' has become a new Vedic appendix in itself

 Experts of psychology and alphabets are of the opinion that the name has a profound effect on a person's macro-subtle personality
 naam soch-samajhakar to rakhaa hi jaay, uske saath naam roshan karne vaale gunon ke vikaas ke prati jaagruk rahaa jaay, yah jaruri he
 In Hinduism, naming rituals contain the best formulas to explain this purpose
 namakaran shishu janm ke baad pehla sanskaar kaha ja saktaa he
 Thus, immediately after birth, the ritual of ritualism is the law, but in the present circumstances it does not appear in practice
 apni paddati main uske tatva ko bhi namakaran ke saath samahit kar liya gaya he
 Through this sacrament, the soul, incarnated in the form of an infant, is tried to reach the benefit of a welfare sacrificial environment
 jeev ke purv sanchit sanskaron main jo hin hon, unase mukt karana, jo shreshth hon, unka aabhaar maananaa-abhisht hota he
 At the time of naming ceremony, considering the basic welfare tendencies, placement of aspirations, sources of awakening inside the infant, an environment should be tailored to them
 shishu kanya he yaa putr, iske bhedbhaav ko sthaan nahin dena chahie
 There is no such distinction anywhere in Indian culture
 shilvati kanya ko das putron ke baraabar kaha gaya he
 ‘das putra-sama Kanya Yasya Shilavati Suta
 ' iske vipareet putr bhi kul dharm ko nasht karne vaala ho saktaa he
 ‘jimi Kaput’s products are total Siddharm Nasahin
 ' isliye putr yaa kanya jo bhi ho, uske bheetar ke avaanchhneeya sanskaron kaa nivaaran karke shreshthatam kii disha main pravaah paidaa karne kii drushti se namakaran sanskaar karaayaa janaa chahie
 While performing this rite, in addition to giving birth to the child's parents and the people present in the mind, there is a sense of the importance of making them a great personality
 bhav bhare vaataavaran main praapt sutron ko kriyanvit karne kaa utsaah jaagta he
 Usually this rite is performed on the tenth day after birth
 us din janm sutaika kaa nivaaran-shuddhikaran bhi kiya jaataa he
 If this maternity work is done at home, then the room should be cleaned by washing and washing
 shishu tathaa mata ko bhi snaan karake naye svachh vastra pahanaaye jate hai
 At the same time, the order of yajna and sanskar fulfills the intended purpose by dissolving divinity in the environment
 yadi dasven din kisi kaaran namakaran sanskaar na kiya ja sake
 So on some other day, it should also be done later
 ghar par, pragna sansthaanon athwa yajna sthalon par bhi yah sanskaar karaayaa janaa uchit he
 In addition to the usual arrangements for worshiping the yajna, special attention should be paid to these arrangements for the naming ceremony
 balak to anek yoniyon main bhraman karata hua maanav sharir main aayaa he, isliye uske man par pashavik sanskaron kii chaaya rahani swaabhaavik he
 It must be removed
 yadi pashu pravriti bani rahi, to manushya sharir kii visheshta hi kya rahi he
 Those who have loyalty, feelings towards human ideals, can only be called human beings in the true sense
 indiray-parayanata, swarthparata, niruddeshyata, bhavishya ke bare main sochna, asanyam jaise dosha ko pashuvritti kehete hai
 Those who have abundance of it are male animals
 apana navjaat shishu nar-pashu nahin rahanaa chahie, uske chir sanchit kusanskaron ko dur kiya hi janaa chahie
 For this refinement, the child is first anointed as soon as he enters the sacrament hall
 sinchan ke liye taiyaar kalash main mukhya kalash kaa thodaa-sa jal yaa gangaajal milaayen
 Children should be sprinkled with the mantra on the crematorium and equipment
 bhaavana karen ki jo jeevatma shishu ke rup main ishwar pradutt suavasar kaa laabh lene avatarit hui he, uskaa abhinandan kiya ja rahaa he
 In order to inculcate the ability of the child to fulfill his responsibilities in accordance with the divine plan, grants are being received from him from the source of the best sanskars and satta shakti
 upasthit sabhi parijan apni bhaavnaatmak sangati se us prakriya ko adhik pranavan bana rahe hai
 Mekhala prepared for the ceremony is tied in the baby's waist
 ise kahin-kahin kaundhni, karadhani, chuta aadi bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is a symbol of staying committed
 faujee jawan, police ke sipaahi qamar main peti baandhakar apni duty puri karte hai
 It may also be unusable in terms of body comfort; But the belt tied at the waist in terms of emotion, represents agility, promptness, pessimism, elation, preparation and readiness for duty-keeping
 yah gun manushya kaa praarambhik gun he
 If there is deficiency in it, then it will have to live underdeveloped, poor and underdeveloped life
 aalsee, pramaadi vyakti apni pratibha evam kshamta ko yon hi barbaad karte rahete hai
 The loose nature does not allow a man to live anywhere, all his works are incomplete and chaotic, as a result of which no promising result can be found
 is dosha ko bijankur bachche main jamane na paae, isaki saavdhaanee rakhane ke liye jaagrukta evam tatparta kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke uddeshy se namakaran sanskaar ke avasar par qamar main mekhala band di jaati he
 Whenever the parents see this mekhala, then remember that they have to try with life to keep the child from the blame of laziness
 jaise-jaise baccha samajhadaar hota chale, vaise-vaise uske swabhaav main mustaidi, shramshilataa evam kaam main manoyogpurvak jutane kaa gun badhaate chalanaa chahie
 The losses and gains that can be made in this regard, should also be explained and taught from time to time
 mantra ke saath shishu ke pita uski qamar main mekhala baandhen
 Feel that with this sanskriti sutra, the virtues like readiness, awareness, restraint are being established in the child

 ganit main, augustin louis kaushi ke naam se namakaran kiya gaya sammishra vishleshan kaushi samakal prameya, [[samishra sankhya|sammishra samtal main holomarfic falan ke liye rekha samakal ke bare main ek mahatvapurn kathan he
 In fact, according to this statement, if two different paths connect two points and that is the holomorphic function between these two paths, then the two paths of this function will be identical
 yah prameya praayah nimnanusaar vivruth pathon ke liye sutarabaddh he : mana U, c kaa ek vivruth samucchy he jo ekashah sambaddh he, mana f : u → c ek holomarfic falan or mana γ { \ displaystyle \ ! \ , \ gamma }, u main ek chaapakalaneey path he jiskaa prarambh bindu or antya bindu samaan hai
 Then jaisaa gursa ne pradarshit kiya ki main kaushi samakal prameya ko keval yah maanakar siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki u main f ' kaa sammishra avakal sarvatra vidyaman he
 This is meaningful because the Kaushi Samakal Sutra can be proved by these functions and this results that this function is indeed infinitely differentiable
 yah shart ki u ekashah sambaddh he kaa matlab yah he ki u main koi vivar nahin nahin he athwa samastheyata vyanjak main, u kaa moolbhoot samooh trivial he; prayek vivruth chakti u = { z : | z − z 0 | < r } { \ displaystyle U= \ {z:|z-z_{0}|<r \ }} iskaa ek udhaaharan he
 It is important; agreed jo ek ikai vrut ko nirdisht karata he or tab path samakal Is zero; The Cauchy integral theorem is not applicable here since f = 1 / z { \ displaystyle f = 1 / z} is not defined at z = 0 { \ displaystyle z = 0}
 is prameya kaa ek mahatvapurn parinaam yah he ki ekashah sambaddh praant par holomarfic falan ke path samakalan kii gananaa vaastavik kalan ke moolbhoot prameya se kii ja sakati he : mana U, sammishra sankhyaon ke samucchy c kaa ek ekashah sambaddh vivruth upasamucchy he, mana f : u → c ek holomarfic falan he or mana γ, u main khandashah avkalaneey path he jiskaa armbh bindu a he or antya bindu b he
 If the complex of f is f kaushi samakalan prameya upar pradarshit udhaaharan se thodi prabal vaid hogi
 Suppose u is a loosely connected subset of c and f is a function that is holomorphic on u and continuous on u ̄ { \ displaystyle \ textstyle { \ overline {U}}}
 mana γ { \ displaystyle \ gamma }, u ̄ { \ displaystyle \ textstyle { \ overline {U}}} main ek valay he jo simit lambaai ke saath u main chaapakalaneey valay ke γ k { \ displaystyle \ gamma _{k}} kii samroop seemaa kaa parinaam he or nimna seemaa kaa paalan karata he See for example for more information
 kaushi samakalan prameya kaushi samakalan sutara or avshesh prameya kaa parinaam he
 If the partial differential of the holomorphic function is continuous, the Cauchy integral theorem can be proved as a direct result of the Green theorem and the effect of the real and imaginary part of f = u + iv { \ displaystyle f = u + iv} is The region bounded by γ { \ displaystyle \ gamma} must satisfy the Kaushi – Reiman equation and in addition to the area of the entrained entropy of U
 kaushi ne ise siddh bhi kiya lekin yah baad main gursa ne sadish kalan athwa aanshik avkalan kii santyatata paddati rahit uplabddh karavaaya
 We can divide the integral f { \ displaystyle f} and similar derivatives dz { \ displaystyle dz} into their real and imaginary components: is avasthaa main hamen nimna praapt hota he According to Green's theorem, comparing real and imaginary parts tathaapi kshetra d { \ displaystyle D} ke vaastavik or kaalpanik bhaag vishleshi falan honge, atah u { \ displaystyle u} or v { \ displaystyle v} ke liye bhi kaushi-riman sameekaran santusht honi chahie : Hence we get that their integers are zero

 amvaat fever yaa rumeti hridrog ek aisi avasthaa he, jisamen hriday ke valve ek beemaari kii prakriya se kshatigrast ho jate hai
 This process starts with a throat infection caused by streptococcal bacteria
 yadi iskaa ilaaj nahin kiya jaye, gale kaa yah sankraman rumetic bukhaar main badal jaataa he
 Rheumatic heart disease develops due to recurrent rheumatic fever
 rumetic bukhaar ek soojanevaali beemaari he, jo sharir ke, khaas kar hriday, jodon, mastishk yaa twachaa ko jodanevaale utakon ko prabhavit karti he
 When rheumatic fever permanently damages the heart, that condition is called rheumatic heart disease
 har umr ke log gambhir rumetic bukhaar se peedit ho sakate hai, lekin saamanyataur par yah paanch se 15 varsh tak kii umr ke bacchon main hota he
 a damaged heart valve either does not close completely or does not open completely
 pehali sthiti ko chikitsakeey bhashaa main insphisiency or duusari sthiti ko stenosis kehete hai
 The blood in the heart valve, which is not completely closed, goes back to the same chamber of the heart from which it is pumped
 ise rigargitation yaa licage kehete hai
 With the next heartbeat, this blood crosses the valve and mixes with the normally flowing blood
 hriday se guzaranevaali khun kii yah atirikt maatra hriday kii mansapeshiyon par atirikt boj daalati he
 When the heart valve does not open completely, then the heart has to pump more than normal amount of blood, so that enough blood goes into the body in a narrow way

 Chest X-rays and Isoji are two common tests that indicate whether the heart has been affected or not
 chikitsak iskaa upachaar marij ke saamaanya swasthya, chikitsakeey itihaas or beemaari kii gambhirtha ke aadhaar par tay karte hai
 Since rheumatic fever is the cause of heart disease, its best treatment is to prevent recurrent rheumatic fever

 The six decades of 1960 to 2010 can be said to be important for the modern art of Rajasthan for two reasons
 ek to yah ki is interval main bahuterey ullekhneey chitrakaaron kaa kaam saamne aayaa or duusare yah ki yahan ke kuch chitrakaaron ne rashtriya str par apni pahchaan banane ke liye nihaayat moulik, apni nijee chitrabhasha bhi ijad kii
 It was during these years that teaching and teaching of arts at the university level also started
 kala ke kshetra main shodh or anusandhan bhi isi avadhi main zyada saamne aa paae
 Today, there are probably more than three hundred painters of small and big 'modern' style in Rajasthan, but it is possible to mention briefly those artists whose works have their own charitic-privacy if not in 'kathaya', notation
 i definitely do
 bharat main aise chitrakaaron kii sankhya bahut adhik nahin, jinhone apane praayah puure kala-jivan main keval jyamithik roopakaron ko lekar hi kaam kiya ho, par nihsandeh mohan sharma kii jagah aise hi logon main thi
 Born in Nathdwara, a town in Chittor, the works of Mohan Sharma continue to depict a 'utopian' urban system that is illuminated by the divine light of fantasy
 1966 se laga kar apni antim kriti tak mohan sharma ne jin jyamithik roopakaron ko srijan kaa aadhaar banaaya, ve roopakar mahanagar ke paardarshee sannaaton ko pratidhwanit karne main kaamyaab hue, jinka nilvarni swapnil maahaul mohan sharma ke achetan main bahut gahare paith gaya maaloom hota tha
 Constantly conscious of the basic truths of painting, length, breadth, depth, distance, light and shadow, Mohan Sharma's creations continued to create illustrative geometric figures - which we can see by standing with a cheat
 yadi inke kaam ko koi ‘sthool‘ pahchaan dena chahen, to ham kah sakate hai ki antatah ye kritiyaan ‘ghanavaad‘ kaa hi naveen roopaantaran hai
 From the beginning of 1970 and after that Mohan Sharma painted the series titled 'cosmic-crystals', we have seen a world of imagination and artistry in which today's metropolis-sense has emerged sharply
 ye keval deevaaron, chauraahon or galiyon kii saamaanya yaa chaltau abhivyakti nahin he, apitu aakaaron se thasathas bhari kisi mahanagareey jindagi ke jivant aks hai
 There are signs of highways, flyovers, and bridges, where there is a strange andravelous flicker of lights and darkness
 kahin khidakiyon kii aankhon se jhaankati roshni kaa dhundhala sa sira hamaare haath lagata he or achaanak dub jaataa he, yah sab jaise ek mayalok hissaa he, jahaan rangon kii rahasyavadita ke daine, nagar-aakaaron ko apane agosh main band lenaa chaahate hai
 Mohan Sharma was present as a ready-made craftman by 'fusing' the acrylic colors, securing their brilliance and 'divinity' and spreading them on the face of a colorful halo
 mohan sharma kii chitra duniya itani ekaantik or stabdh he ki maanviya spandan kaa koi sutara kalpanasheel soundarya se bhari is sristi main vichaarte hue hamaare haath nahin lagata
 After a period, the flattering, inertia and the beautiful solitude of his paintings shatters us from within because there is no character in his well-crafted theater
 is arth main mohan sharma goonjte akelepan ke vaastushilpi the
 The sense of civility in the paintings of Mohan Sharma emerged as brilliantly - perhaps not in the works of any Rajasthan painter
 vah apni choti, kintu sarthak jindagi main jyamiti kii ungali tham kar hamen mahanagar kii uchaat aatma tak le jane kii koshish karte rahe
 Mohan believed that now in the village world, when it is not possible near us to return to its sacred past, then why can't the images of present-life and the symbol of modern civilization remain the inspiration for creation? When the geometrical world of man-made architecture is an indispensable reality for contemporary societies, is it not a kind of mental exodus to move art towards the 'imaginary' village? yah bhi ek ajeeb baat hi kahi jaaegi ki manushya kii bhautik nirmitiyon ke prati mohan sharma jitne samvedansheel or ashanvit the, utani hi berukhi or aruchi unhen kala main-manushya kii upasthiti se thi
 He considered the world of civilization created by man as a fine example of his creative abilities, but he never found the presence of man in canvas to be suitable
 mohan maanate the ki aadhunik aadmi bheetar se nitant swaarthee, krur or badsoorat he
 The best side of it is still its creation — a replica of which can be seen in the dams created by holding vast watersheds, the infinite sprawl of cement-concrete, and the diverse forms of urban progress that touch the sky
 ‘‘aisa nahin ki meri dilchaspee ‘aadmi’ main nahin, par main apni swayan kii image, niraashaa or asantosh se itnaa ukta gaya hoon ki mujhe dar he ki chitron main aise aadmi kii upasthiti unhen badsoorat na kar de xxrep 4 
 ’’ mohan sharma ne apane ek catalog main likhaa bhi tha
 Apart from city experiences in his paintings, there is also a pleasant presence of 'real-life' - tea tables, vases, cups, kettles, fruits and other things with the help of windows, which he also used to keep the image in his canvas
 aisa lagata he jaise ‘thos’ yahan kuch he hi nahin, sab kuch kaanch sa paardarshee or ghulaa-mila he, jiske bheetar prakaash or chaaya kii manohar aavritiyaan hai
 In this sense, his abstraction is not 'formless', because he wanted to keep us attached to some eye-reality
 suza ne likhaa he, mohan sharma main -‘‘ghanvaadee sanrachanaon kii ullekhneey samaj he
 "for the first time, seeing his portrait, Hemant Shesha remembered the works of Lionel Finder, but Souza believes that" instead of 20th-century German cubism, the work of Mohan Sharma is rooted in the temple of the sixteenth century Chamunda Devi Basoli
 Are more closely related to the artifacts
 ’’ The 'craftsmanship' that has been praised everywhere in Mohan Sharma's creations is due to the well-worn shades of colors and the sharpness of the geometric shapes
 1976 or baad kii inaki kritiyon main parivartan ke kuch ek spasht chinh dekhe ja sakate hai
 The biggest is that their designs are not as dense and chunky as they used to be in the previous art-era
 1976 ke baad kii inaki rachanaaon kaa shilp apekshaakrit saral hua
 For this reason, some new experiences of depth and perspective entered
 rangon ke fusion kii takanic yahan bhi he, parantu baad ke daur kii kritiyon main mohan sharma ek vishisht tarah ke sarleekaran kii ore badhate dikh padate the
 Did this thing finally come in his painting and not only indicate deep maturity? duusari pramukh baat yah he ki 1976 ke baad unke kathanak bhi kinchit badale hue hai
 Moving away from mere repetition of walls and buildings, they made choices — walks or scenes of the natural world, most prominent of them — the sea and the desert
 kalakaar kii aankh se dekhen to samudr or registan main koi antar he hi nahin
 They are synonymous for art purposes
 donon main ek anant bhav he
 They both bind us with the pleasure of being seen
 yahan registan yaa sagar kaa vistaar kshitij tak failaa hua he or kai baar to aisa lagata he jaise vah nissim he yaa drushti-path se aage bhi vah sajiv he
 There are signs of walks and ships in the works of this period of Mohan Sharma
 prasangvash yahan yah bhi likhnaa sangat hoga ki chitravkash ko lekar bhi ek sajag-bhav inke man main tha
 An attempt has also been made to use its texture of canvas here
 ‘‘main kala ko maansik shanti or santulan kii abhivyakti kaa jariya maanata hoon xxrep 4 
 ‘‘ mohan kaha karte the
 In fact, among our mature artists, his compositions provide an opportunity to see some persistence and nafees regarding the subject and its subsistence
 rangaton kaa shaleen istemaal or sateek brashawork mohan sharma kii nijee khubiyaan thim- jiske sahare unhone apana ek alag muhaavara viksit kiya
 Perhaps that is why Suja saw Mohan Sharma as 'a sequel' to the art-consciousness of 'pag' in India and appreciated it again and again
 yah samakaleen chitrakala ke liye durbhagyapurna tha ki mohan sharma achaanak hamaare bich se chale gaye
 He was hopeful for life till his last breath while fighting a deadly disease like cancer and more than that he would be able to recover and draw again
 par aisa hona bada na tha
 Even though Mohan Sharma is not there today, what he has left in memory for his fans and acquaintances - those are some of the works that hypnosis may be less than the best work of prospective newcomers, completely finished
 It cannot happen
 vidyasagar upaadhyaay kaa naam bhartiya aadhunik kala ke maidan main janaa pahachaanaa he
 He is known for his dark-white intangible creations
 shailigat vishishtita ke kaaran bhi vidyasagar un rachanakaaron main rahe hai, jinhone apni kala ke liye rajya se baahar bhi ek kala-sangraahak or prekshak-varg taiyaar kiya he
 Vidyasagar started drawing with pencil drawings and from 1968 to 1976, he continued drawing only in pencil due to constant means and sense
 is kaarykaal main unki priy pencil thi-3-bi, jiskaa saghan prayog karte hue inhone apane madhyam kii komal samvedansheeltaa se rishta kaayam kiya
 Here, the spread of black-white shapes on the paper is produced by successive strokes of the pencil, in which the nuances and bulk of the lead are made at some places
 haalaanki keval pencil kii rangaton kaa pradarshan hi inkaa ekmaatr abhisht nahin, parantu chalate-chalaate kai dfa ham aisa ahsaas paa jate hai jaise vah pencil kii ‘kamaniyata’ or iske jaldi-jaldi badal jane vaale mizaaj ko hi apni kritiyon main giraftaar karnaa chaah rahe hon
 Vidyasagar's pencil is also proven to create a dark atmosphere
 vah bakhubi jaanati he ki lagaataar ghisaai kaagaj par kitna prabhaavshaalee kaalaapan rach sakati he
 Whatever the metaphor Vidyasagar has produced on paper in his pencil illustrations created in large numbers are abstract - nowhere near the real-world effects of the world, but like the tangible sensations of darkness, of the complex world of the unconscious Image
 andhkaar or lagaataar bana rahane vaala koi rahasy hi in rekhaankanon kaa mul bhav he
 Vidyasagar creates darkness through black designs and also attempts to take us into a strange kind of lyricalness, mysticism and deep sensory resolution
 unke aarmabhik kaam main tantra-chitron kii samvednaa mukhar he
 Somewhere in such works, we sit with sexual symbols or genitals and sometimes reach them with the help of buried symbolism
 prakaash inaki rachanaaon main unmukt bhav se nahin upja, lekin jahaan bhi vah upasthit he, lagaataar apane astitv kaa bhaan karwaata chalata he
 In the midst of the magical mystery of darkness, even the flame of dim to dim light creates a fascination for itself — similarly the lightness of the empty white space evokes a distinct sensation in their underlines
 kabhi apane ‘compojishan’ ke saanche main sakaaran istemaal karne, kabhi prekshak ko aashcharyamishrit prafullata main daalane ke liye inhone texchar ko kaagaj kii peeth se ubhaara he
 Hence, there are many reasons for his interest in taxpayers - from the intrinsic demand of 'subject' to only skill and complacency
 par ullekhneey yah he inke chitron ke bhitari anushaasan ko bigaadane main texcharon ne kabhi bhi apni simaaon kaa atikaraman nahin kiya
 Wherever they are, they are polite and courteous and despite their 'being' are not so 'verbose' as to damage the internal strength of the pictures
 pencil rekhaankanon kii shrinkhalaaon main upaadhyaay ne udaipur ke bahut se kalakaaron kii tarah hi, apane liye jyamithik-sanrachana kii raah pasand kii thi or inaki aarmabhik kritiyaan zyaadaatar ‘cantral-compozishan’ main hi banaai gai hai
 After 1976, Vidyasagar moved away from pencils and resorted to a new color medium acrylic and even today he is working in it
 unka madhyam main badlaav yah soochna to detaa he ki ‘madhyam’ ke rudh ho jane kaa ahsaas unke achetan main tha, kintu lagbhag vahi kathy, ve hi roopakar or vahi kendriya-sangyojan hamen inke chitron main kaagaj kii bajaae canvas par aarambh ke kuch varshon main utraa miltaa he
 In this sense, Vidyasagar's medium change until 1978 was not a 'creative' change
 yah mahaj kala-saamagree kaa badlaav hi tha
 1978 and after this Vidyasagar appeared before us with a new composition
 apane roodhiyon or kathanak se hat kar vah jo nai cheez laae, vah thi-prakruti
 Whether they are images of mountains, clouds, rivers, and rocks, or other scenes, he has renounced the content and geometry of the former to underline the hilly and rocky typology — between which they have lived for a long time
 ‘‘mere liye yah aavashyak nahin ki koi anubhav thik usee shakl surat main kala main aae yaa prayukt ho
 One experience connects and transforms with another experience or many experiences
 koun si cheez rachana-karm main kab or kis tarah kaam aati he-bahut pechida baat he
 i have said the same thing many times
 jaise ‘pebles’ ko apni bahut si rachanaaon main chitrit kiya or man bhar kah lene ke baad phir kisi duusare anubhav ko uthaa liya
 Impressions of fish, ship movements, 'flying birds' or 'flying rocks' have also come in my paintings
 ’’ vidyasagar batalaate hai
 From these free and free works, where their old theme monotony has dissolved, these black-white illustrations and oil paintings take us - to the mountainous experiences that fascinate them because of their unevenness and independent existence
 pencil ke alaava acrilik rangon ke inke chitron main ham drishyon ke najadik jate hai-is anubhuti ke sahare ki ye pahaad or chattaane amoort, andhkarpurn hote hue bhi hamen baandh sakane kaa bhav apane main sanjoe hai
 Here we also see nature, which has been his latest subject - has happened in a sensible space-combination
 kaagaj yaa canvas kii safed sataha ko apane avkaash ke liye baratane or chhodane kaa kaushal bhi yahan he
 Some times he seems to be immersed in the desire to express his lyrical or biotic-looking motifs through a certain type of grouping
 nadi kinare ke gol-gol pattharon, akaash ke dhabbon or patharon ke sudur bimbon ko pakadati inaki kritiyaan hamen asal-kathy se itar bhi prakruti kii prishthbhumi ke alok yaa dhundhalkon kaa parichay detii hai
 Therefore, as the role of the things which have come to the forefront, Vidyasagar is also interested in marking his background and in fact this is the secret of the entirety of these visualizations
 upaadhyaay ke chitron kii ek or visheshta kaa ullekh karnaa yahan aprasangik na hoga
 That specialty is the study of colors
 kaale-safed kii ekresata ke swaad ko, canvas ke eksepan ko jo cheez bhang karti he, ve hai-rangaten
 There are many types of shades - liquid, medium, dark and dense
 rangaton kii vajah se hi ham chitron main ek khaas tarah ke anubhav kii vividhta se judate hai
 He evokes perspective in scenes and the relative distances between things
 vidyasagar upaadhyaay ke rekhaankanon par suparichit kathakaar or sameekshak ashok aatreya kii yah tippanee bhi mahatvapurn he-‘‘ xxrep 5 
 unke bachapan ke sanskaron main bhi aravali-shrinkhalaaon kaa sthaan kam mahatvapurn nahin rahaa
 The new paintings of Vidyasagar, it seems, present seductive scenes of intimate interviews of the mountains
 unamem sammohan jagaane vaali kushalta he
 Thus, these pictures do not give any 'graphic' experience of the mountains at any level, but at the level of extreme privacy, their privacy seems to open the layers of secrets
 kahin-kahin par lagata he jaise ve kisi vishaal kaali raatri ke dainon ke samaan akritiyaan kaat kar banaae gaye hai
 He makes full use of his medium and wears it on paper until he achieves the deep satisfaction expected from him
 vah apni style main ek shramik kii nishtha rakh kar vah sammohan jagaa dete hai ki prakruti apni baari-bharkam mudra banane ke baavjood ek sahajata, ek rahasy liye khadi rahati he

 In Vidyasagar, where there is a heavy mind like a mountain, it also provides that sky-like rest to its observer and it seems that he has left alone in a journey where he has the conditions to find the 'stop'
 pencil ke vishaal belanaakaar, gol, ticone, tikhe, ghumaavdaar, sidhe or oonche-neeche aise kai padaavon kii ore vidyasagar apane shilp ke madhyam se sanket karte hai, ki yatra thakaane yaa ubaane vaali prathit hoti

 ek baar poochne par ki keval syah-safed main hi chitra kyon banaate rahe hai, vidyasagar upaghyay ne kaha tha- ‘‘ meraa maananaa he ki keval rangon se hi kalakaar kaa vyaktitv nahin banataa
 i do not use colors as artists usually do, but i see and use black-white tones as the colors of nature
 pencil ko shuru main ek tarah kii rachanaatmak majaburi main thama tha, par dhire-dhire kaala safed hi meri abhivyakti kaa abhinn ang ban gaya
 Even today the mind is not full of it, so i am continuing to work in it xxrep 4 
 '' kintu baad main rangon ke sammohan ne vidyasagar jaise chitrakaar ko bhi apni taraf khinch hi liya, jo sirf kaale or safed ko hi apni pehali abhivyakti maanate rahe the
 Although Vidyasagar did not enter the discipline of colors all of a sudden, moving from black to white has been a major revolutionary change for him
 udhaaharan ke liye ham in rangamay canvaason main prakruti kii vibhinn mudraon ko ek puraane sammohan kii hi tarah, chitra falak par utraa hua dekh sakate hai
 In these paintings, Vidyasagar has transformed trees, mountains, rocks, clouds and rocks
 yahan bhure, pile, kaale or duusare halke rangon kii rangaten hai
 Taking the shelter of their liquid sensations, these colors lead an observer to the vast nature of nature and its constantly changing synthetic shapes
 rangon ke chayan ko vidyasagar apni is nai chitra-shrunkhlaa ke liye kaaphi urjaadaayak maanate hai
 His idea is also that "in these colors i can find such a liquid, transparent and sensitive creation, which would probably be relatively difficult to express in any other medium
" vah in chitron main apni puraani kathavstu ko naye dhang se kehane ke pakshdhar hai
 One of the specialties of these paintings is that Vidyasagar Upadhyay's familiar portrait-posture, especially the black and white investigations, do not end here
 ve apane parichit chakshush-soundarya ko barkaraar rakhte hue atyant taral or halke rangon or unki rangaton ko kholte hai
 a special urge in his mind towards painting and natural forms is about its vastness, he expresses it by choosing large size canvas
 yaho bahut sara avkaash he-ek nirvaat jaisaa, jisamen prakruti ke roopakar rangon ke bich ubhar rahe hai
 They have long-sighted scenes and figures of differential images
 prakruti ke vishaal swaroop ko yahan saghanikrut kiya gaya he
 Depth of perspective, plot texture and texture humidity can be seen in them
 is rangeen kritiyon main vidyasagar paryaapt kaavyatmak or samvedanpurn bane rah sake hai
 These canvasses have a structure in them - a geometric rhythm and motion, which is like a pre-notice of the great changes in the shapes
 layaatmakataa ke prati unki lagan or prakruti ko lekar chaaya rahane vaala anuraag vidyasagar ke man main kai varshon se he
 In his new paintings he seems to be approaching this attachment
 baarik tantuon or kaali rekhaon kii sakriy upasthiti se vah hamaare saamne roopakaron ke bheetar upasthit rahane vaali choti, kintu maheen or sakriy samvednaaon ko bhi kholte hai
 Now their designs are no longer formal, they seem to be far-fetched in the smooth dynamics of nature and its inner emotions
 is prakaar ke mukt aakaaron main jahaan prakruti kii abhivyakti ke liye nae dharaatal upje hai, vahiin kai baar inke jarurat se zyada ‘angadh‘ ho jane ke khatre bhi saamne aae hai, kintu ek banate hue chitra-sansar main ye sab baaten adhik mahatv kii nahin hai
 Vidyasagar Upadhyay deserves our praise as a distinguished artist among the painters who work continuously
 or ham, unki kritiyon main har nae rachana-padaav ke prati ashanvit
 Suresh Sharma's oil paintings are examples of colors of the same color and very carefully designed geometry
 vah canvas ke vishaal spes main khud apana arth talashti rangaton ke chitrakaar hai, jinke yahan ‘niraakaar‘ ke prati teevr vyamoh yaa poorvarag baraabar upasthit rahata aayaa he
 The geometric insistence on the very liquid hidden in the colors of the same one or a few colors produced by spraying pure colors and shades gives a different personality to Suresh Sharma's paintings
 yah shubh he ki bhale kuch suprasiddh videshi chitrakaaron se unke chitra-samya ko chhod den, unka kaam rajasthan main rah rahe aadhunik chitrakaaron main bhinn bhi he or ‘saahasik‘ bhi
 In addition to oil paintings, Suresh Sharma has also made sculptural and graphic raids and his experience of working in these three mediums in the development of his art journey is so connected that it is difficult to see it separately
 haalaanki vigat kuch varshon se vah keval tailchitr hi bana rahe hai
 But the work he has done in graphic in the early years is a reflection of his interest and tendency to explore something new in this medium
 suresh sharma kii kala rajasthan main rah rahe duusare bahut saare samakaleen kalakaaron se apane arth or prabhaav main bhinn he
 His creative autonomy is his most notable capital — though he is often accused of being 'unsophisticated' —and that is because of his creations, we should see the new American art stream Ed Ranhard and Joseph Elbers There is a sudden memory of the works of such artists
 yah prabhaav shaayad isliye bhi itnaa paardarshee or spsht he ki vah kuch samay ke liye america main rahe hai
 It is evident that the impression of art-trends there is deep on them
 unke chitron kii yaad rakhane laayak baat yah he ki unka amurtan aakaaron yaa virupan kaa amurtan nahin he- balki vah ‘niraakaar‘ rach kar bhi avaantar se ek duusare bhav-bodh kaa darwaja hamaare liye kholte hai
 There are two characteristics of its paintings
 ek to yah ki apekshaakrit ek vishaal chitra-avkaash inke yahan he duusari yah ki vah keval ‘rangaton‘ par hi kaam karte hai
 The style of 'using' colors is also different in these acrylic paintings
 inhen visheshtaon ko lekar hi unke canvaason ke lakshya anyon se kuch alag hai
 His paintings have sensitive colors, which are all over the face of the spray of colors, like the fog in December
 ve kisi bhi rang kii ho sakati hai- nile, kaale, bangnee yaa kisi or gahare rang kii, par ve saare canvas par ecchhatra samrajya sthapit kiye rahati hai
 Within them there is a sense of twisting and churning
 aisa lagata he jaise dekhte hi dekhte badal apni akritiyaan badal lete hai- shaayad canvas kii ye rangaten bhi usee prakriya main he
 It has a constant vibrancy and vibration
 ve kabhi-kabhi to dhunen kii taral chadar kii tarah puure falak par ‘chaa janaa‘ chaahati hai
 Suresh Sharma wants to save us from the monotony of colors by putting geometric patterns on the canvas only when we see something very lightly and carefully, but these geometrical chambers are so sparse and symbolic that the fluid sensation of the picture is' Do not become a burden
 inke kaam main prishthbhumi or mukhyabhumi jaisi koi avadharana he hi nahin
 Whatever is the background, the same is also present in front of us on the board
 usamen aisa koi bhed nahin ki koun aage he koun si peeche
 This is because it is not the abstraction of any 'shape'
 suresh sharma hamen rangon ke arthpurna prabhaavon ke sahare jaise ek darshanik shunya se saakshaatkaar karwaanaa chaahate hai
 So, standing in front of its canvas, we often expect that maybe a 'bold' color phenomenon will happen on it or we will get to see something 'solid' on the colors - but it never happens
 unke saare chitra hamen duusare tarah ke maun main le jate hai
 It is a silence made from gradations of colors, on which no color phenomenon emerges, just colors flying like mist continue on the canvas
 suresh sharma kii sabase badi uplabdhi yaa ‘saahasikta‘ yahi he ki inhone keval rangon ko hi roopakar ke rup main kaam main liya he
 It would probably be too much with him to say that he has suddenly 'jumped' at his current art-idiom
 unke is niraakaar ke peeche rahi hai kuch yatraayen-graphic or acrilik main, jahaan shuru main duusare kalakaaron hi kii tarah hamen vah ek ‘akruti pradhan‘ amurtan hi main le jane kii koshish main tallin dikh padate the
 This pose was perhaps more pronounced in his graphic impressions
 kintu kramshah unke canvaason se aam taur par najar aane vaali rang-yojanaayen, aakaar or unki samvednaayen lupt hone lageen- or unki jagah le lee- sirf rangon or rangaton ne, rangaten jinako samooche canvas par chhitaka kar vah unke jariye ek sookshmatar ‘bodh‘ hamaare bheetar jagaane kii baat shaayad sochate hon
 May be many of us find this world of Suresh Sharma simplified to a great extent, but in my own view this simplification is a special kind of immortalization
 ek aisa amurtan jo pehali martabaa main itnaa grahya or saamaanya nahin ki chalate-chalaate yaa ‘kejual aproch‘ rakhte hue use ham saraah saken
 To do this, we have to flow with his picture-vision, sometimes parallel, sometimes beyond and beyond
 apni sari rachana-prakriya main astitvvaadi vichaarkon kii tarah hi vah bhi duusare kii upasthiti ko katai jaruri nahin maanate
 This makes it clear why all their art is completely personal and subjective? Why, like most painters, is he not insistent on a shapeless abstraction? jahaan tak suresh sharma ke kaam main jyamithik sanketon kii maujuudagi kaa sawaal he, jaisaa hamane pehle kaha, uskaa asal abhipraay yahi he ki ek to ye varg, chaukhaane yaa samanaantar rekhaayen canvas kii rang ekresata kaa khandan karti hai or doosraa yah bhi ki ve painting ke prati kalakaar ke ek sachet sambandh kaa suchak hai
 The creation of art is no longer an accidental event, rather it becomes an attempt to make the creation-instinct effortlessly into art-object
 ye rekhaaen, varg or jyamithik sanket itane spasht or moortmaan nahin ki ekaek puri rachana par ubhar aaen, balki inkaa dhundhalapan or sanketikta bahudhaa ek alag swaad kaa sammohan hamamen jagaati he
 As much as we try to break away from their presence, this sparse, transparent geometry grows as elusive as it is within us, so it is difficult to appreciate this picture in a straightforward way because of its visualism, especially the macro designs
 There is no solicitation for anything and as we have said, his conscious paranoia towards 'formless' makes him an artist of his own kind of idiom
 unka kaam dekh kar hamen yahi lagata he ki kala main aadhunik hone kaa ek maayna shaayad yah bhi he ki chaalu raterik se alag ham rangon kii vyakaranvihin virat duniya main pravesh kar jaaen or rangaton va rangon ke niraakaar ko hi apana khud ek arth talashne den
 Shabbir Hasan Qazi's work has yet become a stereotype - not because he is currently in the process of identifying his picture-world
 lagaataar kaam karne vaale aise chitrakaaron main unki ginati he jo apane liye gambhirthapurvak koi spasht maarg talash karne kii rachanaatmak uhapoh se guzar rahe hai
 It is his effort that inspires us to discuss his art
 vah 1969 se kaam kar rahe hai or ab tak mul rup se unki dilchaspee kaa vishay rahi he- tantra yaa jyamiti kii kalpanaayen
 Darker colors are more pleasing to them
 vah ek vakt main laal, kaale or hare ko khul kar canvas par lagane vaale chitrakaar the
 In the paintings of the seventies, he had only the intensive use of green
 saare ke saare falak par haraapan mandit hua karata tha, jis par safed kaale or duusare gahare varnon se kuch ‘cycadalic‘ si milti julati kaali-pattiyon or laharon vaale swatantra roopakar the
 Shabbir's early work had a 'commercial' style of abstraction appealing to most eyes, which was very close to the danger of becoming a 'design' at some places
 vah apni kritiyon main aakaaron ke prati itane saavdhaan the ki jyamithik akritiyon kaa canvas par aayojan ek hichak bhare istemaal ke saath karte dikh padate the
 Many of his early works had a particular sense of suspense, confusion and hesitation, and at times seemed to be concerned with his anxiety, reduced to the inner creation of the picture and fulfilling it with attractive color combinations, to 'liberate' him from his obligation
 'it is more to get
 par tip banate chitrankan or jyamiti yaa tantra jaise puraane vishyon ke dohare khatre se khelte hue shabbir ne ekadam nayaa or moulik na sahi par pranjal or aakarshak lag sakane vaala kaam kar kala main pravesh kiya tha
 Like many young painters of Udaipur-school, Shabbir also initially wanted to take his stand on geometry
 jyamiti ke aakarshan ne haalaanki inhen ab bhi apane main baandh rakhaa he- par idhar ke kaam main jyamiti ke sandarbh puraane nahin hai- ve kadaachit parivartit or parvardhit hai
 Her inertia is breaking and now she seems to be part of the world of paintings
 shabbir kii 1975 or aasapaas ke varshon kii rachanaaon main kaam or aadhyatm ke kuch ati parichit pratik hai- camel, stri-yoni, chandra, netra, andhkaar vagairah jinako jyamiti ke anushaasan main piroyaa gaya he
 In these paintings, Shabbir has used sex-symbols to create or change his composition of the picture
 kabhi-kabhi inhen dekh kar gulam rasul santosh ke chitron ke puraane tantra kii smriti taaja ho aati thi
 But all these things usually happen with a becoming painter
 shabbir hasan kaaji ke tantric-pratikon ko le kar banaae in chitron main ek craftsman kaa kaushal sarvatra he
 There is a plan and a devotion among them
 vah mehnat se rang lagane ke pakshdhar hai
 The designs in his paintings are more solid and rectangular than before
 ve jyamithik sanrachanaon main tej rangon ke bich sthapit hai
 There is a role of Prakash and Ujas somewhere between them
 inhen dekh kar aisa lagata he jaise koi thos cheez dhoosar or taral ho rahi ho
 In Shabbir's work of this time, it would be too much to find any clear cosmic images, but imagine the figures of birds or flying airplanes can be identified
 ‘hard-aij‘ ke ye saaf suthere hisse kahin-kahin bahut kaavyatmak hai
 They have a poignant fluidity despite the presence of warm colors
 rangon ke fusion yaa rangaten banane main shabbir hasan, mohan sharma jaise kalakaaron se peeche jarur hai- par vah bhi is baat kii koshish main tallin najar aate hai ki gahare yaa mul rangon se khub acchhee tarah bhare canvas kii sthirataa yaa jadta main thodi si ‘halchal‘ paidaa karne ke liye halki, kintu samvedansheel gulabi yaa pili rangaten ‘ugi hui‘ najar aaen
 These shades can be a sign of light for us taking some shape, which despite being less able to attract our attention
 hare or laal ke alaava kaale or bangnee main bhi shabbir ne bahut sa kaam kiya he
 In his early work, perspective-consciousness is not so vocal, but in later times he also starts giving the feeling of being aware of this art reality
 shuru ke lok-alankaran kii si sapaat anvitiyon yaa kaale safed chaukhaanon or pattiyon ke cycadalic istemaal ke baad unhone chitron ne ek alag karavat lee or vah kaale ke madhyam se koi rahasy, vishaad yaa andhkaar khadaa chaahate hai
 'blackness' is also very much in a painter like Vidyasagar, but the darkness of Shabbir's paintings is very romantic and colorful
 unke chitron ko dekh kar aisa lagata he jaise andhere kamare main koi mehataab jala rahaa ho
 Similar sensations exist in his picture series 'shamaan'
 canvas ke avkaash main inke yahan roopakar jis style main rache gaye the vah dekhnaa bhi rochak he
 Previously, they were connected to each other by images of strips or floors - they remained independent and separate from each other in the middle art phase, now they are combined with calligraphy or script signs
 inaki nai rachanaaon main do vishesh pravritiyaan hai- ek to yah ki yahan farsi kii kellingraphy pravisht ho rahi he or duusari yah ki ab rangon kaa mizaaj bahut kuch badla hua he
 The color is not as bold and straight, but there is a mixture of dense melancholy in them
 yah prakriya kuch-kuch aisi hi he, jaise manch kii tej roshni ko badalane ke liye natyagrih main arcllamp ke saamne jilatin kaagaj laga diya jaataa he
 We can see this change in Shabbir in the continuity of the mood of his paintings
 parivartan, kalakaar main ek khaas muhaavarey main kaam karne or uski sambhaawanaaon ko uker lene ke baad aana sahaj or swaabhaavik he
 Even here, though the change is slow and gradual and there is a journey of pictures behind it, it is also easy to understand it easily
 khaas taur par unke liye jo kabhi shabbir ko chatkh jyamiti or ‘optical ilugen‘ paidaa karne vaale ek kalakaar ke rup main dekhte or jaanate aae hai

 This calligraphy of Persian did not come only in pictures like calligraphy, but some of my other experiences behind it are also related
 maine pichley saalon main aadhyatm kii duniya ko pahchaanane kii koshish kii he
 Like a 'bande', i am excited to get a closer look at the life-philosophy and personality of Sufi Peers' 


 says Shabbir
 ‘‘pataa nahin achaanak jane kaise mujhe dharm or aadhyatm main gahari ruchi paidaa hui or isi junun main main is arase main sufiyon ke saannnidhya main rahaa bhi hoon xxrep 5 
 sufiwaad kii sari ‘feeling‘ hi amoort he‘‘ xxrep 5 
 shabbir hasan kaa vichaar he
 In some of his paintings he seems to be moving closer to this 'realization'
 haraa rang to pehle se hi inaki rachanaaon main islamic dharmik samvednaa ke rup main upasthit rahaa he, parantu apni ek chitra shrinkhalaa main bhi vah hare or kaale ko vah apni puri damak or moulikta main prayukt karte the, ab rangon kii chamak ko dhire-dhire kam karke vah apane kathanak kii gaharaai ke najadik le ja rahe hai
 Darkness, according to them, signifies creation or 'ignorance' in the pictures, in which the divine light is hidden
 ‘‘meri rachanaaon kaa kaala rang negative nahin he, balki usamen bhi jivan he
 "shabbir believes that even in pure geometry, he did not enjoy the pleasure that was in the new paintings taken with the Ananda religious or 'sufi' conception
" jyamiti kii simaaon se parichit hone ke baad ab shabbir main use us puraane arth main prayukt karne kaa utsaah nahin he or vah kaaphi mukt roopakaron ko apane canvaason par laa rahe hai
 As the next step of such paintings, now Shabbir has started painting trees, flowers and similar shapes, perhaps once again expressing his interest in nature
 yadi in chitron kaa vishay prakruti he, to inaki abhivyakti ke liye yahan vah jyamithik or swatantra roopakaron ke sangyojan kii koshish karte hai
 Like his earlier spiritual disciplines created earlier, although his initial urges towards geometry are weak, he was not completely free from geometry
 prakruti ko lekar taiyaar is canvaason main aadhaar-rangon ke saath jyamithik akritiyaan bhi badastoor dikhalaai padati hai
 These geometric shapes in the canvas are just a foundation for the main amphitheater, it is not their intention to discover the beauty of geometry
 yahan rangon kaa gaharaa aalep he, kintu ek kaushal ke saath
 In these pictures of Shabbir Hasan, we see black, green, red, blue and some similar warm colors, which is important in terms of creating a perfect background and then giving a suitable place to his plot on it
 aisa lagata he ki vah nirantar mul rangon se hi kaam lenaa chaahate hai
 In these paintings the marking of the figure is planned and employed
 shabbir ke banaae phool yaa vriksh jis rang-lok kaa hissaa hai, vah sambhavtah pratyaksh main dikhalaai nahin de sakate
 It may seem that we are seeing these flowers in a dark dream or a half-asleep
 yah ek ullekhneey parivartan he or inke canvaason main ab ek nae padaav kii anugunj sunai pad rahi he
 Fragmented images of human figures have come up in his recent work
 aakarshak rang-prayog or takanic main siddhi inaki ullekhneey visheshtaayen hai, jiske sahare ham shabbir hasan kaaji jaise chitrakaaron se or gahari aashaaen rakh sakate hai
 Like literature, regionalism is also a major inspiration for art
 shaayad isliye ki lok jivan main hi apana sudurtam ateet dhundh sakate hai
 The primitive roots of our city-consciousness tree are finally in the villages, so in the pictures and illustrations of Bhavnishankar Sharma, we have to roam around and interview the rural-world scenes in some way, so it is not an unnatural phenomenon
 vah hamaare liye adal-badal kar rajasthan ke gaanv kii drushyavali ke bimb laate hai
 These can be images: peacocks, huts, their ornate doors, fences and rags, niches, windows and trees
 pichley kuch varshon se bhavanishankar ‘gaanv‘ ke prati ek rachanashil samveg se jude hue hai- uskaa chitratmak sarleekaran karte hue vah hamen kam se kam rangon main aanchalik drishyon kii sarvavyaapaktaa main le jane kaa aagrah karte hai
 He draws directly on the canvas with black ink
 apekshaakrit bade aakaar main pent kiye safed canvas kii spes ko vah syaahi ke sakriy rekhankan se bharte hai
 The presence of vegetation or entangled vines and trees, which are part of the construction of the scene, is also the artisan's gesture to the huts and hot plots: a fluid expression of rural scenery, something that can be identified
 Is made up of well-known symbols
 graamy-sristi ko hi le kar chitrankan karne vaale duusare parichit varisht kalakaar udaipur ke pi
en
choyal se bhavani shankar ke chitra-abhipraay bahut kuch alag hai
 In the zonal world of PN Choyal, huts, old rainy, sweaty walls, trees and doors are intertwined with each other, stagnating in a strange colored haze
 ve kahin tehre hue bhi, pighalate or behate hue dikh padate hai
 They have a noticeable humidity, but Bhavani Shankar is not as symbolic and misty
 vah bahut kam rekhaon main sidhe-sidhe hamen aanchalik-jivan kaa bodh karana chaahate hai
 Bhawanishankar has also produced graphic raids, mostly studies of peacocks
 1970 or aasapaas ke saalon main nirmit in chhaapon main ham chizon ko bilkul vaisaa nahin dekhte jaisi ve hai, balki unki vyaktigat rachana-drushti ke madhyam se baahar aate-aate ve hamen kinchit badali si najar aati hai
 But not even to the extent that they make us seem innocent or strangers
 simit virupan ke saath in chhaapon main moron or murgon kii akritiyaan, unki gati or vibhinn mudraayen hai
 There are many peacocks in Vanasthali, where he lived and worked
 mor, vanasthali viapeeth kii ashram samskruti kaa ang rahe hai
 In the illustrations, Bhavani Shankar tries to catch each 'ada' of peacocks
 vah naachte, thirakate, prem karte, ladate or chalate hue moron kii mudraaen ankit karte hai
 His study of peacocks is somewhat different from his father-painter Devkinandan Sharma
 in rachanaaon main vah gaiyr-paramparaagat andaaj main apane kala-guru or pita se bhinn, moron ke chaak-chauband, udaan ke liye tatpar yaa kute ke hamale se aahat swaroop ko yathasambhav kam or arthjanak rekhaon main vyakt karte hai
 These compositions have abstractly depicted the moving motif of peacock in etching, offsets, lithographs or woodcut techniques
 rekhaon main teji or takanic kii saadagi in chhaapon kii visheshtaayen kahi ja sakati hai
 a remarkable change can be seen in the works of Bhawanishankar in 1975 and beyond
 vah yah ki unki dilchaspee main na keval kuch or vishay daakhil hue hai, apitu is daur main graphic ke alaava bhi vah telarangon ko bhi apni chitrabhivyakti kaa madhyam banaate hai
 Although the presence of peacocks in his compositions of this period is occasionally intact, but he also brings the color and energy of Rajasthan's public life, fairs and regional world colors
 unke is daur ke chitron kii ek gauratlab khaasiyat he-chitravkash kaa upyog
 Bhawanishankar does not create clouds on the entire board
 vah uske ek bhaag ko prekshak kii kalpana ke liye adhuraa sa bhi chhodte hai
 This emptiness of the canvas is not an emptiness, but within it also exists an invisible composition, which is the spread or expansion of the visible tangible
 ham khaali jagah ke bheetar bhi chhipe hue drushyon ko anubhoot kar sakate hai
 For example, in the pictures related to the fairs of Rajasthan, humanities for them are really just color perception
 vahaan meley main jamaa bheed thode se laal nile pile or kaale rang-dhabbon ke jariye upjaai gai he
 Standing at the back of a fair on a river bank, like a cinematographer looking at the whole scene from the 'wide angle', he wants to compose inflated images of the fairs of Rajasthan indicating 'distances' 
 aise kuch chitron main canvas kaa puraa hissaa upyog main nahin laayaa gaya, kintu ’nirvaat’ main bhi kuch ’hone’ kaa bhav sannihit he
 This is a creative capital of his paintings
 vigat arase main bhavanishankar sharma ne ek or shrunkhlaa par kaam aarambh kiya tha, jisamen vah aaj bhi rachanaayen kar rahe hai
 Here he presents a combination of two opposite sensations
 prakruti, jaisaa hamane pehle kaha, aadhunik chitrakaaron ke nikat ek bahut arthpurna sarokaar he
 Bhawanishankar also derives from his structures of vegetation or nature
 jaise jangal kii belon or mukt tahaniyon ko vishaal or kathor shilakhand aage badhane se nahin roak pate, vaise hi ‘hard aij‘ kii thos jadta ko bheetar se tod kar baahar jaati hui gatiman vanaspati chitron main apni upasthiti lagaataar darj karti he
 The black concrete geometric blocks symbolize 'mater' or physical matter in them, through which the vegetation is automatically taking a shape, symbolizing indomitable life from the cracks
 vanaspati is jagah chetana yaa ‘konshasanas‘ ko hi bimbit karti he
 a dynamic consciousness whose continuity and strength is embedded in it so that it can maintain its life, despite all the obstacles! The pictures in this series are mixed-medium, with a mixed use of ink and oil colors on canvas
 canvas ke ek bhaag main, vah jahaan sadhe kaushal se adhiktar syaahi rekhankan ke sahare vanaspati kii bunaavat kaa ankan karte hai, vahiin sidhe brush se us par angadh or gahare rang aghat lagaate hai
 This breaks the traditional Romanticism of composition, while it is also an attempt to put two different poles of composition together
 in rachanaaon main bhavanishankar maanav-akritiyon ke prati utane aagrahashil nahin, kintu prayaas karne par prekshak unke roopakaron main chaaron ore se ghire hue aadmi kii chhaviyaan pakshi jaisi akritiyaan or vrikshon ke bimb khoj saktaa he
 Like the work done in miniatures, he often draws with black ink on canvas
 saghan or uljhi hui amarbelein jaise ek duusare main guthim samooche vriksh kii satta par chaa janaa chaahati hai, vaise hi inke chitron main lataayen or vrikshon kii daaliyaan gatiman ho kar agrasar hoti si jaan padati hai
 He is mostly engrossed in promoting his designs
 isliye unki is series kaa sheershak agar ‘flowering of form‘ he to yah asangat nahin
 i begin my talk with the metaphors found in nature
 rachana kii andaruni jarurat ke anusaar roopakar badalte hai
 i too simplify or dematerialize them according to the picture-resolution

 1964 main vah rajasthan main snatkottar str par kala kaa adhyaapan shuru hone ke baad dayanand college, ajmer main praadhyaapak pad par aa gaye or tab inhone yahaan aa kar mausamon, vrikshavliyon, sthaneey pahaado, gharon, jaanwaron, bazaaron, galiyon or rosemara ke drishyon kaa vaash-style main chithran kiya
 Not only did he paint Indian deities in colors, but he also made imaginative paintings based on some poems of Jaishankar 'prasad'
 apane vyaktichitron ko lekar inhen kala-jagat main khaas jagah or pahchaan mili
 Jaiswal in Ajmer created many walks and portraits, touching on the nuances of watercolor depictions, but the influence of the traditional Bengal and Lucknow gharanas on the talent of Ram Jaiswal was more pronounced
 vah hameshaa se ek sundar falak darshak ko uplabdh karaane ke liye sachet rahe hai, bhale hi kathith aadhuniktaa ke naam par unhone ‘street singrs‘ yaa ‘nitijna‘ jaise kuch ek chitra bhi banaae hon
 The transformation of the tradition into new contexts and ways is a notable feature of the current art-trends here
 is khubi ko shail choyal ke chitron main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 If we want to do the classical classification, we get to see a creative transformation of the Mewar style in his works
 vah paramparaagat kalam ke bhawan-shilpon, vanaspati evam unki aantarikta ko apane yahan utaar lenaa chaahate rahe hai
 From the very beginning, he has done such an eye-pleasing work, developing a permanent affection for the prevailing and visualization of miniatures, which we can see in other painters as a 'use' of the tradition
 inke kaam main jo aakarshak rang-yojana evam sangyojan-kshamta he, uskaa sabab yah he ki shail ne parampara ko ek seedhi kii tarah istemaal kiya he
 Both the specialty and weakness of Shail Choyal's paintings is that he, like the miniature styles of traditional art, wants to move us around by a 'gross' visual pleasure
 chaahe vah paramparaagat chitrankan main vyavsaayik taur par utane nirat kalakaar na bhi hon, shail choyal laghuchitron kii si kamaniyata, andrik aakarshan or vishaybaddhata ke aadhaar par hamen adhiktar apane nav-vyavsaayik takaajon tak le jate hai
 As we said earlier, the essential condition of his paintings is visualization
 ve chaahe nayak-nayika ke abhisar-kshan hon yaa unke shayan-kaksh kii antarangataayen; shail choyal apane chitron main aksar ek prashast, par kathanak bhare ekant kii sarjana karne vaale kalakaar ke rup main saamne aate hai
 This self Sannata or Prabha Shah's medieval palaces were not the solitude of the medieval palaces of painters such as Mohan Sharma, but rather the intermittent silence of Shail Choyal, the lack of mewari windows and vents, the transience of palaces and the dense vegetation , Which we have also seen in miniature tradition
 vah apane tailchitron evam graphic chhaapon main jharokhon, sidhiyon, munderon or farshon kii darshneeyata ko surakshit rakhte hue hamen aksar ek rang-birangi ‘nav-saamanti‘ duniya saunp dena chaahate hai
 By looking at his creations, it often seems as if he wants to search for us by hiding scenes within scenes from a swapping perspective
 paribhaasha ke arth main vah keval sairon yaa drushyankanon ke hi chitrakaar nahin hai, par canvas par parvaton, vrikshon or vanaspatiyon kii kamaniyata prakat karte hue shail choyal paramparaagat mewari bhawanon, rajput chhatriyon or alankrita dwaar-paaton kaa prachurtaa se ankan karte hai
 Around this theme Prabha brings the oil paintings of Shah to the observer - images of dignified domes, chhatris and Nafis palaces! The imaginative use of geometry is in Prabha Shah
 ek yaa do rangon kii rangaton kaa adhikadhik prayog karte hue vah rachati hai- rajasthan, jo apane shilp, thethpan or sthapaty ke lihaaj se apratim he
 Udaipur is hidden somewhere in their unconscious
 vah keval telarangon main, rajasthan kii paramparaagat chhatriyon, mehalon or bhawanon ke bimb ubharti hai
 The paintings of Prabha Shah include the lost palaces and buildings in Rangat, Prashant and stunned
 idhar kuch saalon se unka koi kaam pradarshan main nahin dikhaa he
 Udaipur has inspired many painters to paint as a city of Chitropam
 kiran murdia bhi parmanand choyal, chhotulaal, prabhaa shah, shail choyal, abha murdia, charan sharma, hemanth chitrakaar or kai anyon kii tarah hi apane paitruk-shahar udaipur ke 'bhawan-bhugol' se prabhavit hai, par ullekhneey baat yah he ki inamen se har chitrakaar kaa ankan-najariya ek-duusare se bhinn he
 To say Kiran Murdia's paintings also have the presence of Mewadi ranges, paths, trees and palaces, but Kiran's sensation is not as 'simple'
 chitron main kiran murdia bahut kuch anaupchaarik, rachaavpurn evam deshaj hai
 In the depiction of the mountains and the cliffs and the dwellings, the intertwined trees and scenery, they are dense, chic, modern and embellished with Chhotulal, Shail Choyal or Prabha Shah and others
 isi tarah udaipur ko lekar shail choyal jitne safgo to nahin, par haan, puraani peedi ke bahut kalatmak or samvedansheel chitrakaaron main hai, inke kalakaar pita pi

 Unlike the commercial decoration in Shail Choyal's paintings, his painter father PN In Choyle's compositions of the 1970s and beyond, the effort to tarnish shapes with color-fluidity

 'P
 Mansaram is also one of the most talented and well-known painters born and brought up in Rajasthan, who have been referred to a lot in contemporary art
 kolaj, jyamiti, murtishilp, chhayankan or rachanaatmak lekhan, kai kshetron main pi
 mansaram ne vishisht kaam kar apni jagah nirmit kii he
 Not only did Manasaram take satisfaction with the use of colors on canvas, he gave his painter the opportunity to delve deeper into other mediums as well
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp he ki unhone kuch baras pehle apane janmasthan-mount abu main ek sthai suvidhasampann kaaryshaala chitrakaar-awaas ke taur par shuru kii he
 Panchal Mansaram exhibited the finest creations in India and abroad with the combined use of colors, photography, graphic, computer and photocopy machine
 mount abu ke aravali pahaado, mumbai kii bheedbhad, banaras kii ganga aadi ke alaava hindustan kii aam chhaviyon ko unhone behad kaushal or kalpana se saakaar kiya he
 Mansaram, with the help of his artisan wife Tarunika, has painted his home 'mount' at Mount Abu in an observable place from far away, by painting it with various colors on the huge rocks of Aravali
 har saal vah apane vatan aate hai or apane aap ko samakaleen bhartiya kala kii naveenatam gatividhiyon se jude rakhane ke liye lambi-lambi yatraaen karte hai
 Narayan Acharya has done graphic raids and others have created oil paintings, while P
 Mansaram's art creation is relatively comprehensive
 narayan acharya kaa yogadan graphic madhyam ko apni abhivyakti ke liye chaynit karne ke liye mahatvapurn kaha ja saktaa he, kyonki jab unhone is madhyam ko grahan kiya tha, tab yah utana ‘lokapriy‘ nahin tha
 Charan Sharma used ink and other mixed media in his early works, but in his later art-period he is seen to be present with many interesting memories of the craft of Rajasthan, combined in very large size acrylic colors
 charan sharma ko ham unke naveenatam kaam main apane shahar kii bhawan-smritiyon se nirantar judaa hua kuch us tarah nahin dekhte jis tarah yah baat prabhaa shah or shail choyal kii rachanaaon main he
 Charan's Ardhangini Nimisha Sharma is a very capable modern artist
 charan sharma ke tamaam praarambhik rekhaakannon or tailchitron main bhi sankethik taur par nathdwara upasthit tha
 The surrounding world should be an unbroken part of the painter's senses - it is simple and natural and from this we can see the mewari-bawdis, Kunds and chock-like houses in the early work of Charan Sharma
 thik vaise hi jaise bhavanishankar ke chitron main rajasthani meley-thele yaa vanasthali ke mor
 There are many memories of Rajasthan in Charan Sharma's early work
 charan sharma prarambh main rekhankan or jalarangon main kaary karte the, baad main vah telarangon or acrelic madhyam main utre
 In his later work, Charan embodies the ascetic images of Gautama Buddha in a remarkable depth
 rajasthan mul kii apni chitrakaar patni nimisha sharma ke saath vah kai dashakon se mumbai main rah kar ab vishaal aakaar ke canvas bana rahe hai, jo photography ke unke anubhavon kaa rachanashil roopantaran bhi hai or vishay ke taur par, rajasthan kii duniya ke sthool yatharth se aage jane kii unki pratigya bhi
 Chintan Upadhyay's work and name are well-known among the young painters of the state living in Mumbai

 In 1299, Khilji's forces made a big attack on Gujarat
 In this attack, the Vaghela Rajput king Karna Vaghela of Gujarat was badly defeated, in which Karna lost his empire and possessions as well as his wife
 The Gujarat conquest of the Turks brought an end to the Vaghela dynasty and added a new chapter in the history of Gujarat
 Alauddin Khilji was married to Kamala Devi, the wife of Karna
 Famous historian of Gujarat, Makarand Mehta, says, "there is evidence of Khilji marrying Kamala Devi
" Makarand Mehta says, "padmanabha wrote Kanhanade Prabandha in 1455-1456 which was based on historical facts
 In this also Rajput king The story of Karna is narrated
 "mehta says," Padmanabha has made reference to the sources of Rajasthan and his writings have historical recognition
 In this book Alaud on Gujarat DIN describe in detail the attack Khilji

 raman prakirnan yaa raman prabhaav photone kanon ke lacheele vitaran ke bare main he
 It was discovered by the famous Indian scientist Mr
 CV Raman
 raman prabhaav ke anusaar, jab koi ekvarni prakaash dravon or thoson se hokar gujarata he to usamen aaptit prakaash ke saath atyalp tivrata kaa kuch anya varnon kaa prakaash dekhne main aata he
 In 1930, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Chandrasekhar Venkataraman for his discovery
 raman kii puri shiksha-diksha bharat main hi hui
 Rs 200 itself By designing a spectrometer, we could make such an important discovery only on the strength of diligence, diligence and exclusive research
 shuru main raman ne surya ke prakaash ko bangnee filter se guzaar kar praapt bangnee prakaash kiran punj ko drav se guzaara
 The output beam was mainly of purple color, but after passing through the green filter, the presence of green rays in it was also seen in very small quantity
 raman prabhaav rasinic yogicon kii aantarik sanrachana samajhane ke liye bhi mahatvapurn he
 This effect is quite an important discovery for scientists
 rashtriya vigyaan diwas ke din bharat ke vibhinn kshetron main vigyaan ke gatividhiyon kon badhaava dene vaale kaarykamo kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 After repeating the experiment on more than 60 different liquids, it was ensured that all the fluids represented the Raman spectrum
 drav badalane se keval usase prakirnit spectrumi rekha kaa rang badalata he
 In the experiments so far, the effect was being confirmed by just looking
 kintu raman jaanate the ki jab tak raman-rekhaon kii tarangadairdhyon or unki aapekshik tivrata kaa maapan nahin kiya jayega tab tak na to prabhaav kii santoshjanak vyakhya kii ja sakegi or na hi vaigyanik jagat main manyata praapt hogi
 For this he used a quartz spectrograph, the quantitative results of which were published in the Indian Journal of Physics on March 31, 1928
 yah ek adbhut prabhaav he, isaki khoj ke ek dashak baad hi 2000 rasinic yogicon kii aantarik sanrachana nishchit kii gai thi
 After this, the internal structure of the crystal was also explored
 raman prabhaav ke anusaar prakaash kii prakruti or swabhaav main tab parivartan hota he jab vah kisi paardarshee madhyam se nikalataa he
 This medium can be anything solid, fluid and gaseous
 yah ghatana tab ghatati he, jab madhyam ke anu prakaash urja ke kanon ko prakirnit kar dete hai
 This happens in the same way as the striker splashes the pieces on the carrom board
 photone kii urja yaa prakaash kii prakruti main hone vaale atisookshm parivartanon se madhyam kii aantarik anu sanrachana kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Raman was a very enthusiastic, hard working, and brilliant man
 19 varsh kii aayu main unhone pratham shrenee main pratham rahete hue bhautikee main em
e
 kiya or vitt sevaaon kii pratiyogi pariksha main safal hokar kalakatta main upmahaalekh adhikri ban gaye
 The desire to pass some taxes and interest in science linked him to the Indian Association for Cultivation of Sciences, a science research institute established by Mahendra Lal Sarkar
 ve din bhar apane daayitv kaa nirvaah karne main vyast rahete or shaam se der raat tak prayogshaala main
 His early work was related to the exploration of science associated with the working of musical instruments
 raman kaa vigyaan ke prati samarpan itnaa teevr tha ki 1917 main jab unhen kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee ke palit professor banaae jane kaa prastaav mila to apni sarkari naukari chhodkar lagbhag aadhi tankhaah par unhone is pad ko sweekaar kar liya
 Raman's entire education took place in India and till now his contact with other scientists of the world was through books and articles printed in international research papers
 1921 main pehali baar ek adhyayan yatra par unhen videsh jane kaa avasar mila
 The blue-blue waters of the ocean caught their attention while traveling by ship
 lard raile ne akaash ke nile rang kii safal vyakhya vayukanon se prakaash-vikirnan ke aadhaar par kii thi kintu sagar jal kaa nila rang unhone akaash kaa jal main pratibimb maan liya tha
 This interpretation was not acceptable to Raman
 unako lagata tha ki jo siddhant vaayu ke nile rang ke liye uttaradaayi tha vahi jal ke nile rang ke liye bhi hona chahie, isliye, apni vaapasi yatra main unhone ek jebi spectrummapi apane saath rakhaa
 Ss During the voyage on a vessel called Narkunda, he did some experiments of scattering with glaciers and water with the help of this device
 bharat pahunchate-pahunchate unhen vishwaas ho gaya ki unka vichaar sahi tha
 He sent 'a short article to Nature in this regard and got absorbed in his experiments with light scattering with his team of young scientists
 7 varsh ke athak parishram or saikadon dravon evam thoson se prakaash-prakirnan kaa adhyayan karne ke baad aakhir 28 farvari, 1928 ko unhone raman prabhaav kii ghoshnaa kii
 Since 1987, this day has been celebrated in India as National Science Day
 raman prabhaav kii upyukt vyakhya keval kwantum siddhant ke aadhaar par kii ja sakati he, jahaan ekvarni prakaash punj ko urja yukt kanon ke pravaah ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 When these photons collide with the particles of the medium, they either have elastic collisions that emit waves of essentially the same frequency or unpredictable collisions that can also provide spectral lines of longer wavelengths than incident radiation and shorter wavelengths
 Also spectral lines of
 apratyasth sanghatt se praapt vikiranon kaa prakram raman prakirnan kehalaata he or iske parinamswaroop praapt spectrumi rekhaaen 'raman rekhaaen' kehalaati hai
 An effective tool for physicists Early Raman effect was used in research studies by physicists
 pehle 7 varshon main is prabhaav ko aadhaar bana kar 700 se adhik vaigyanik shodh patr prastut kiye gaye
 On the one hand, in terms of theoretical physics, this effect provided a strong basis for quantum physics, while on the other hand it gave experimental physicists a highly efficient, simple technique for studying the structures of crystals and molecules
 phir dhire-dhire bhautikavidon kii is nai takanic main ruchi kam hone lagi
 But by then this technique was becoming popular among chemists as an analytical tool
 rasayanagyon ke aujaar ke rup main prayek padaarth kaa apana vishisht spectrum hota he
 Therefore, mixtures could also be chemically analyzed without destroying the substance and the material could be organic or inorganic by its signature in the Raman spectrum
 saath hi spectrumi rekhaon kii tivrata kii tulana se unke saapeksh pariman kii upasthiti kaa akalan bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 It was a widespread technique and could also be used for gases and solids in addition to liquids
 kintu dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad sugrahi sansuchakon or electronic main hue vikaas ke kaaran vaigyanikon ko avarakt spectrummiti raman spectrummiti se saral lagane lagi or raman prabhaav ke anuprayogon kii ore rujhaan kuch kam hua
 But the Raman effect again became popular among scientific inventors from the 1960s after the discovery of Lessor
 raman prabhaav ke sansuchan main sabase kathin samasya yah thi ki raman rekhaaen bahut ksheen hoti thim isliye unke sansuchan ke liye atyant teevr prakaash strot kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The laser not only provided such a very intense light source, but introduced new effects in the scattering light that added new dimensions to Raman spectrometry
 parinamswaroop raman spectroscopy ke anek parivartt viksit hue
 The basic concepts used in these include paginated Raman for sensitivity enhancement, Raman microscopy for improving spatial resolution, and resonance Raman for highly specific information acquisition
 in sankalpanaaon ke samakalan se anek bhinn-bhinn raman spectrum takneekein viksit kii gai hai
 Commercial Raman spectrometers became available from the late 1980s after the application of computers to furrier conversion techniques and data management, and no field is now untouched by applications of the Raman effect
 jahaan bhi sample ko bina kshati pahunchaae, drutagati se padaarth vishesh ke kuch kan pahchaan kar nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hon, vahaan raman prabhaav sabase adhik prabhavi takanic pradaan karata he
