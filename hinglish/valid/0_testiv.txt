 The demographic effects of famine are acute

 a consistent demographic fact is that the male mortality rate is higher than the female in all recorded famines, even in populations where the male normally enjoys longevity

 The experience of famine relief organizations around the world in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major activities: the "livelihood approach" and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis
 Stressful conditions of food will be tackled by limiting the supply of consumption by individuals and groups, which may be an alternative means of supplemental income, etc
 before trying dismal measures such as selling plots of arable land

 madi yah bhi jaan jaataa he ki rina ko nahin pataa ki rajeev kaisaa dikhataa he or rajeev agle hafte usase milane ke liye aa rahaa he
 Maddy is now in love with Reena and is disappointed at the idea of losing her love
 apane doston or vishesh rup se apane pita dwaara protsaahit kiye jane par madi rajeev hone kaa naatak karne kaa faisla karata he
 When the time is right, he will tell her his true identity
 madi rina ko apana pyaar dikhaata he or ve un paanch dinon main ek saath acha samay bitaate hai
 Reena had previously liked him only as a friend, but now she also falls in love with him

 Here, Maddy goes into depression and starts drinking
 rina bhi uske bina koi behatar nahin he, kyonki use bhoolanaa uske liye bahut mushkil ho rahaa he
 Although the animosity between Sam and Maddy is renewed, Sam notices that Reena is marrying him because he is very angry with Maddy
 aakhirkaar, rajeev ne rina se poocha ki kya vah usase yaa madi se pyaar karti he
 Meanwhile, Maddy decides to accept her current employer's offer to move to San Francisco, California, which she initially declined
 jab rajeev ko pataa chalata he ki rina abhi bhi madi se pyaar karti he, to vah use hawaii adde par le jaataa he
 Maddy thinks that Rajiv has come to punish her once again
 rajeev ne rina ko madi ko saunp diya, jis par donon ek-duusare ke liye apni bhaawanaaon ko sweekaar karte hai

 The group terms of "monosyllabic" or "anaxaksharas", like Sanskrit, are divided into four parts - Namay, Eminent, Prefix and Nipat
 sinhal main hindi kii hi tarah do vachan hote hai - "ekvachan" tathaa "bahuvachan"
 There is no additional "dualism" like Sanskrit
 is "ekvachan" tathaa "bahuvachan" ke bhed ko sankhya bhed kehete hai
 Just as "hindi" and "sinhala" are equated with "vow", similarly we can say that Hindi and pure Sinhala are also synonymous with "gender"
 purush teen hi hai - pratham purush, madhyam purush tathaa uttam purush
 There are eight factors of pronouns used in all three men, which have their own distinctions
 "karm" ke baad praaia: "karan" kaarak kii ginati hoti he, kintu sinhal ke aath karkon main "karm" tathaa "karan" ke bich main "kartri" kaarak kii ginati kii jaati he
 The number of factors remains at eight, despite the "dominant" factor not being the "address" factor
 vaakya kaa mukhyansh "kriya" ko hi maanate hai, kyonki kriya ke abhaav main koi bhi kathan banataa hi nahin he
 Thus Sinhala grammar is mostly a copy of Sanskrit
 to bhi usamen na to sanskrit kii tarah "parasmapad" tathaa "aatmanepad" hote hai or na lat lot aadi das lakaar
 These eight types of verbs are considered in Sinhala - sinhal bhashaa bolne-chaalane ke samay hamaari bhojpuri aadi boliyon kii tarah pratyayon kii drushti se bahut hi aasaan he, kintu likhane-padhane main utani hi duruh
 In speech and speech, i go through the verb only, xxwrep 5 go, etc
 i will not go, go, go etc
 becomes the work of all verbs
 lingabhed hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye tedi kheer mana jaataa he
 Sinhala language is very simple from this point of view
 vahaan "acha" shabd ke samanaarthi "hond" shabd kaa prayog aap "ladkaa" tathaa "ladki" donon ke liye kar sakate hai
 The idioms of each language are its own
 duusari bhashaaon main unke thik-thik paryaay khojna bekaar he
 Nevertheless, due to experience equivalence, similar sayings are available in two different languages spoken by two different castes
 sinhal tathaa hindi ke kuch muhaavaron tathaa kahawaton main paryaapt ekarupata he
 The Sinhala language, which is similar to more than one language of North India, has developed from the language of those inscriptions which BC
 Available continuously since the second third century
 bhagwaan buddha ke parinirvana ke do sau varsh baad ashokaputra mahendra sinhal dweep pahunche, to "mahavansh" ke anusaar unhone sinhal dweep ke logon ko dweep bhashaa main hi upadesh diya tha
 The tradition that Mahamati Mahendra brought with him was "oral"
 vah parampara yaa to buddha ke samay kii "magadhi" rahi hogi, yaa unke do sau varsh baad kii koi aisi "praakrit" jise mahendra sthavir swayan bolte rahe honge
 Sinhala history holds that Mahendra Sthavir brought with him not only the tradition of Tripitaka, but also the traditions of his languages or his stories
 un atthakathaon kaa baad main sinhal anuwaad hua

 vaatil jal athwa carbonated jal, yaa 'fenil peya' vastut: madhrahit peya hote hai, jinhen vibhinn daab par carbonic gas yaa carbon dioxide se kritrim rup main santrupt kiya jaataa he
 Generally, beverages are made by mixing salts, sugars and certain quantities of flavoring and aromatic substances
 fenil peya kaa prayog aushadhon evam saamaanya peya padaarthon donon ke rup main hota he
 The phenyl drink is divided into two classes: a class of phenyl drink is called a normal phenyl drink
 isamen saamanyat: carbonic amla gasayukt jal tathaa alp maatra main namak evam anya khanij lavenon kaa sanmishran hota he
 The taste of ordinary phenyl drinks is saline due to salt
 is varg ke fenil peya ko saamaanya bhashaa main soda jal, yaa khaaraa pani, kaha jaataa he
 Due to the taste and characteristics of salts, there is an analogy between these and natural mineral water
 vastut: saamaanya fenil peya kaa nirmaan prakritik khanij jal ko kritrim rup main utpann karne ke prayaason ke karan sambhav ho sakaa he
 The second class of phenyl is commonly called Lemonade Water, or Sweet Water, or Mridupay
 isamen carbonated jal ke atirikt sugandhsar evam swadasar karkon kaa vishesh rup main prayog hota he tathaa alp maatra main sharkara athwa sacreen ghulaa hota he
 Apart from this, the juices or essence of fruits, flowers, tubers, roots and leaves are used to produce a natural taste in the frothy drinks of this class
 aadhunik kaal main kritrim swadasar karkon kaa upyog adhikadhik hone laga he
 100 to 120 pounds of pressure is used at the time the phenyl beverage is sealed in bottles, producing 45 to 55 pounds of pressure inside the bottle
 is prakaar ke fenil peya kii botalon ke kholane par gas kii daab ke kaaran budbudaan prarambh ho jaataa he or peya se carbon dioxide gas kii adhikansh maatra nikal jaati he
 This action does not take long
 at: aise peya padaarthon kii maang bad gai he jinase budbudan kii yah kriya adhik samay tak hoti rahe or fenil peya ke upree tal par phenyukt dasha adhik samay tak bani rahe
 a botanical product called saponin is used to produce this condition
 yah padaarth vanaspati evam ped paudhon kii chaal ke nishkarsh se praapt hota he tathaa isaki alp maatra fenil peya main mishrit karne se peya ke upree tal par fenil dasha adhik samay tak bani rahati he
 Due to the glucoside content of saponin, its use can cause harmful effects
 at: inkaa upyog simit maatra main hi hota he
 Carbon dioxide is compressed with the help of force pumps in the filled water in the usual manner of carbonization of phenyl drinks
 is reeti kaa prayog sarvapratham 1790 i
 main paul naamak vaigyanik ne fenil peya ke nirmaan kii is reeti ko genevaprakram bhi kaha jaataa he
 This method of construction could not be more successful due to its dense process and soon scientists developed the continuous process
 vyapaarik aadhaar par satat prakram dwaara fenil peya ke nirmaan kii reeti ko khoj nikaalane kaa shrey hamiltan naamak vaigyanik ko he
 Special improvement was made in the continuous process of a scientist named Brahma
 kam laagat tathaa chote aadhaar par fenil peya ke vyapaarik nirmaan main abhi bhi ghaan prakram kaa prayog hota he, parantu bade paimaane par satat prakram kaa hi prayog hota he
 The establishment of a continuous process greatly reduces the cost of construction
 fenil peya ke nirmaan main carbondioxide kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This gas is available in cylinders of special steel, or other metals
 kuch utpaadan kendron main carbon dioxide ke silinder ke sthaan par carbon dioxide gas jenerator kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this, carbon dioxide is formed by the action of sulfuric or other acids on carbonate or bicarbonate
 dhan prakram dwaara fenil peya ke nirmaan main tin dhaatu ke astr yukt taanbe ke paatr, athwa silinder kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It is often best to use two characters or two cylinders simultaneously, because when one character is empty, the other character is available for compression by filling the second time
 is prakram main prayukt honevaale paatr main drav tathaa gas ko kshubdh avasthaa main banaae rakhane ke liye vishesh prakaar ke kshubdhak lage rahete hai
 In this manner carbon dioxide is used in the fluid
 satat prakram main drav carbon dioxide silinder main drav ke rup main uplabdh hota he
 Nowadays large scale production of phenyl drinks is used by automatic machines
 is prakaar kii bottle bharan mashin se hajaaron kii sankhya main botalon main band fenil peya prati ghanta praapt hota rahata he
 There is an amazing increase in the manufacture and consumption of phenyl drinks nowadays
 greeshm ritu main jal ke sthaan par fenil peya ke upyog main uttarottar vruddhi hoti ja rahi he tathaa saamaajik samarohon main iskaa adhikadhik upyog hone laga he
 Perhaps the reason for this is that the manufacturers of phenyl drinks have increased its sales through advertisements
 at: mridupeya kaa vyavsaay uttarottar bad rahaa he
 In the United States, mildew usage is widespread
 bharat main bhi iske upyeg main baraabar vruddhi ho rahi he
 The history of development of phenyl beverage industries is entertaining
 pracheen kaal se hi anek vaigyanikon kaa prayaas rahaa he ki prakritik sroton se praapt swasthyavardhak budbud jal kaa nirmaan kritrim rup main kiya jaae
 In these springs, bubbling was given more importance
 phon helmouet ne pehle pahal pataa lagaaya ki aise jal main carbon dioxide gas rahati he
 This water was given the name of aerated water by Graviel Kennel
 joseph blike naamak rasinic chikitsak ne sarvapratham prakritik sote ke gas ansh ke liye sthiravaayu shabd kaa prayog kiya
 As a result of this, artificial construction of water with special properties of natural springs started
 fenil peya ke udyog kaa prarambh yaheen se hota he
 In 1772, the English scientist Priestley published an article called the action of receiving water by steady air, on the basis of which he was awarded by the Royal Society of London by the Caupli Medal
 sweden ke vaigyanik shile tathaa france ke vaigyanik lavaazye ke satat prayatnon dwaara yah gyaat ho gaya ki pristle kii sthir vaayu carbon evam oxigen sanyojit gas he
 As soon as this was known, an English scientist named John Merwin Knuth succeeded in preparing a special device for the manufacture of small quantities of phenyl drinks in 1775 AD
 is upkaran main zeen hayasinth da magelan ke prayaason ke kaaran 1777i
 main vishesh sudhaar sambhav ho sakaa
 Between 1781-83, Henry Nose, the British scientist, outlined the plan of a machine for the production of phenyl drinks on a commercial basis
 phir europe tathaa england ke anek nagaron main 1789 i
 se 1821 i
 ke bich vyapaarik str par utpaadan prarambh ho gaya
 First in 1807, a phenyl beverage bottle filling factory started in New Haven, Connecticut
 is prakaar kaa ek anya kaarkaana hakins dwaara philadelphia main 1809 i
 main prarambh kiya gaya
 After this, large factories of phenyl drinks were established in many countries of the world
 bhautik vigyaan main krishnika padaarth kii ek adarshikrut avasthaa he, jo apane upar padane vaale sabhi vidyut chumbakeey vikiran avashoshit kar letaa he
 The black body absorbs radiation in a special and continuous spectrum and is re-emitted when heated
 kyonki koi bhi prakaash parilakshith yaa sancharit nahin hota he or vastu jab thandi hoti he, to kaali dikhaai detii he
 However, a black body emits a temperature dependent light spectrum
 krishnika se nikle is saura vikiran ko krishnika vikiran kaha jaataa he
 The shorter the length of the wave in the spectrum of the black body, the higher the frequency and the higher the frequency is related to the higher temperature
 is prakaar, ek garm vastu kaa rang varnakram ke nile ant ke kareeb hota he or ek thandi vastu kaa rang laal ke kareeb hota he
 At room temperature, the black body emits mostly infrared wavelengths, but when the temperature rises a few hundred degrees Celsius, the black body emits visible wavelengths, which look red, orange, yellow, bright, blue as the temperature rises
 vastu ke safed hone tak vah paryaapt maatra main parabangnee vikiran utsarjit karti he
 The term "krishnika" was introduced in 1860 by Gustav Kirchhoff
 jab iskaa yogic visheshan ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he, to yah shabd aam taur par "krishnika vikiran" yaa " blakebody radiation" ke rup main ek shabd main sanyukt ho jaataa he
 The black body emission provides insight into the solar equilibrium state of a continuous field
 shastreey bhautikee main saura santulan main prayek alag-alag foorier mod main samaan urja honi chahie
 This approach led to a paradox, known as the ultraviolet disaster, and containing an enormous amount of energy in the field of sustainable living
 krishnika saura santulan ke gunon kaa pareekshan kar sakate hai, kyonki ve jo surya kii kirnon dwaara vitarit kiye jane vaale vikiran utsarjit karte hai
 Historically, the concept of quantum mechanics came from studying the laws of the black body
 krishnika kaa vikiran ek khaas taapmaana main krishnika ke saath saura santulan or prakaash vikiran kaa prakaash hota he
 This refers to the thermodynamics equilibrium state of light
 prayogtmak rup se yah krishnika yukt ek kathor-deevaaron vaali guha main sthir sthiti santulan vikiran ke rup main sthapit ho chukaa he
 There are no strongly true black bodies in nature but graphite is a good analogy and a closed box with graphite walls at steady state is a good approximation of the ideal radiation of a black body
 ek guha, jisamen koi krishnika nahin he, vah santulan kii sthiti main krishnika vikiran barkaraar rakhane main sakasham nahin he, yah tathy kirchaaf dwaara prayogtmak rup se paaya gaya he, lekin iskaa bhautik mahatv na to kirchaaf ne samajha or na hi plank ne
 Since light is a oscillating form of a constant electromagnetic field, radiation-studies of the black body reveal how temperatures occur in continuous fields, contradicting classical physics
 kyonki kwantum yantriki ke aagaman se pehle prakaash kii saura sthiti itani bhramit karne vaali thi ki 19 veen sadi ke in tarkon ko kaaphi saavdhaanee se pesh kiya gaya ki prakaash kii ek saura santulan sthiti hoti he
 At fixed temperatures, a substance in t can be seen glowing like an oven
 jis bindu par sabhi thos padaarth ek mand laal chamak paidaa karte hai, us bindu ko draper bindu naam diya gaya
 An oven at 1000 k looks red and at 6000 k it looks white
 jab tak oven kaaphi chamakdaar nahin hota tab tak isse koi antar nahin padataa he ki bhatthi kaa nirmaan kaise kiya gaya he, prakaash kaa rang keval taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 Since color is a directly visible measure of wavelength, this means that light at different temperatures distributes different energies between different wavelengths
 tii taapmaana par λ tarangadairghy main prati unit volum i urja kii maatra ko krishnika ghumaav kii avasthaa kaha jaataa he
 Detailed experiments have shown that the state of rotation of the black body depends only on the temperature and not on the emitted material
 This suggests that light, like any other object, actually comes from solar equilibrium and thus the concept of light at t temperature is understandable
 samaan taapmaana par do chijen santulan main rah sakati hai, jaise tii taapmaana par prakaash ke badal se ghira padaarth tii taapmaana par ausat rup se badal main utana prakaash vikirit kar saktaa he, jitna vah sokh le, yah privost ke vinimay siddhant par aadhaarit he, jo vikaranshil santulan ko sandarbhit karata he
 The principle of broad equilibrium states that there is no peculiar correlation between the process of emission and absorption, that the process of emission is not affected by absorption but only by the solar state of the emitting material
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki tii taapmaana par padaarth dwaara utsarjit kul prakaash, chaahe vah krishna padaarth ho yaa nahi, hameshaa us kul prakaash ke baraabar hota he, jise padaarth avashoshit karata he, jo tii taapmaana par prakaash se ghira ho
 The amount of light absorbed for a black body is as much as it falls on the surface
 kisi bhi tarangadairghy λ ke prati ikai samay main avashoshit prakaash urja anivaary rup se krishnika ke karv ke anupaat main hoti he
 This means that the rotation of the black body is as much as the light energy emitted by the black body, which justifies its name
 yah saura vikiran kaa kirchof niyam he: krishnika kaa utsarjan ghumaav prakaash kii saura visheshta he, jo keval guha kii deevaaron kewapamanaper hi nirbhar karata he, basharte yah sthiti honi aavashyak he ki guha main kuch puri tarah se kaali saamagree ho or yah vikaranshil santulan main ho
 Absorption is modified when the black body is so small that its size can be compared to the wavelength of light, because a small object cannot be an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength, but the principle of rigorous equality of emission and absorption Are always justified
 prayogshaala main, krishnika ke vikiran kii maatra kaa anumaan ek badi guha ke praveshdwar par ek chote chhed, ekahohalerum, jisamen krishnika hota he or jise santulan tak pahunchaaya jaataa he or barkaraar rakhaa jaataa he, ke jariye lagaaya jaataa he
 
 The light entering the hole has to be reflected several times on the walls of the cavity before being released , in which process it is almost certain to be absorbed 
 yah pravesh kar rahe vikiran ke tarangadairghy se matlab rakhe bina bhi ho saktaa he 
 tab yah chhed ek saidhantik krishnika ke kareebi sanniktan ke rup main hoga or yadi guha ko garm kiya jaye to chhed ke vikiran kaa varnakram satat hoga, haalanki yah bhi puri sunishchit karnaa hoga ki guha main lagbhag puri tarah se kaali kuch saamagree rakhi gai ho or yah bhi ki santulan kaayam kiya gaya he or ise barkaraar rakhaa gaya he, lekin in praavdhaanon ke saath, yah aage guha kii anya samagriyon par ashrith nahin rahati he
 
 19 veen sadi ke uttararddh ke dauraan saidhantik bhautikee main krishnika ke ghumaav kii gananaa ek pramukh chunauti thi
 The problem was finally solved in 1901 by Max Planck's Planck law of black-body radiation
 thermodynemics or electromangnetismo se talmail rakhte hue unhone vaayen ke vikiran niyam main badlaav kiye or ek santoshjanak tareeke se prayogtmak data ke upyukt ek ganitiya sutara paaya
 To get a physical explanation of his formula, Planck then assumed that the energy of oscillation in the cavity was balanced
 oinstin ne is vichaar ko aage badhaayaa or 1905 main hi photo electric prabhaav kii vyakhya karne ke liye prastaavit vidyut chumbakeey vikiran ke parimanikaran kaa prastaav diya
 These theoretical advances eventually resulted in the elimination of classical electromagnetism by quantum electrodynamics
 aaj, in quanta ko photonkaha jaataa hai or sochaa ja saktaa he ki krishnika kii guha main photons kii gas ho sakati hai
 Furthermore, it guided the development of quantum probability distributions, called fermi-direc statics and bose-einstein statics, and each of these particles applied to different classes, which were used in quantum mechanics instead of classical distributions
 
 pheramion or boson bhi dekhen 
 The wavelength at which radiation is strongest is called the Vaughan displacement law and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the Stefan Boltzmann law
 atah jaise-jaise taapmaana badhata he, chamak kaa rang laal se pile or phir safed se nile main parivartit hota he
 Even as the peak wavelength enters the ultraviolet, enough radiation continues to be emitted at the blue wavelength, causing the substance to appear blue
 yah kabhi bhi adrishy nahin hoga- vastav main, drishy prakaash kaa vikiran taapmaana ke saath ek gati se badhata rahata he
 Brightness or supervised intensity is not a function of direction
 isliye ek krishnika ek paripurna lambartian radiator hota he
 Real objects never behave like absolute ideal dark matter, and instead radiation emitted at a fixed frequency is a fraction of the ideal emission possible
 ek saamagree kaa utsarjan bataata he ki ek vaastavik padaarth ek krishnika kii tulana main kitni acchhee tarah urja kaa vikiran karata he
 This {0} emission { / 0} depends on many factors, such as temperature, direction of emission, and wavelength
 haalanki, ejineering main yah maan vishisht he ki ek sataha kaa varnakrameey utsarjan or avasorana tarangadairghy par nirbhar nahin karte hai, isliye utsarjan ek nirantar prakriya he
 This is known as gray body prediction

 This is closer to the Kircharf law: emission is equal to absorption, so an object that does not absorb all the light falling will emit less radiation than an ideal black body
 khagol vigyaan main taron jaise pindon ko aksar krishnika mana jaataa he, haalanki yah ek kamjor sanniktan he
 a nearly complete black-body radiation spectrum is represented by cosmic microwave background radiation

 Although Planck's formula predicts that a black body will radiate energy at all frequencies, this formula will only apply if multiple photons are being measured
 udhaaharan ke liye, kamare ke taapmaana par ek vargametre ke sataha kshetra main ek krishnika prayek 41 second par ek photone kii ausat dar par drishy range par ek photone utsarjit karegaa, iskaa matlab yah hua ki zyaadaatar vyaavhaarik prayojanon main ek aisa krishnika drishy paraas main utsarjan nahin karegaa
 Although a black body is a theoretical object, the general application of a source to infrared radiation is defined as a black body when the object reaches an emission of 1

 The temperature of a planet depends on some factors: aantarik grahon ke liye, ghatana or utsarjit vikiran kaa taapmaana par sabase zyada mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 This derivation is mainly related to it
 stephen-boltzman niyam surya dwaara utsarjit kul urja detaa he
 where surya sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se urja utsarjit karata he
 Because of this, the Earth is warmed by only a small fraction of it
 surya kii jo urja prithvi par padati he vah he: so ucch taapmaana ke kaaran, suraj baari maatra main parabangnee or drishy aavriti range par utsarjan karata he
 In this frequency range, the Earth reflects a fraction of this energy 1- α { \ displaystyle \ alpha}, where α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} is the Earth's albedo and reflection in the uv-vis range
 duusare shabdon main, prithvi surya ke prakaash kaa ek ansh 1 − α { \ displaystyle 1- \ alpha } avashoshit karti he or baaki ko paravartit kar detii he
 The energy absorbed by the Earth and its atmosphere is expressed as: yahaan tak ki prithvi ek golakaar kshetra π r 2 { \ displaystyle \ pi R^{2}} ke rup main hi avashoshit karti he, yah kshetra kii sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se utsarjan karti he
 If the Earth were a perfect black body, it would emit according to the Stephan – Boltzmann method
 jahaan T_{E} prithvi kaa taapmaana hota he
 The Earth, since it has a much lower temperature than the Sun, emits only the infrared part of most of the spectrum
 is aavriti range main, yah us vikiran ko utsarjit ε ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ overline { \ epsilon }}} karti he, jo ek krishnika dwaara ε ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ overline { \ epsilon }}} iaar range main utsarjit ausat utsarjaktaa he
 So the energy emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere is as follows: yah maanate hue ki prithvi ushn santulan main he, avashoshit urja avashya hi utsarjit urja ke baraabar honi aavashyak he : Substituting the power of solar and earth in equations 1-6 and in simple form it can be called: duusare shabdon main, manyataon ke mutabik, prithvi kaa taapmaana keval surya, surya kii trigya, prithvi or surya ke bich duuri, albido or prithvi ke iaar utsarjan ke taapmaana par hi nirbhar karata he
 If we substitute the measured values for the Sun and Earth: agar ham unity kaa ausat utsarjan tay karen, ham gananaa kar sakate hai ki prithvi kaa "prabhavi taapmaana" aisa hoga : This is what the Earth would be if it radiated into a perfect black body in the infrared, ignoring the greenhouse effect and in the event of an irreversible albedo
 vastav main prithvi avarakt main lagbhag ek purna krishnika ke rup vikirn hoti he, jo anumaanit taapmaana ko prabhavi taapmaana se kuch hi degree zyada adhik badhaayegaa

 dopalar prabhaav ek acchhee tarah gyaat tathy he, jo yah varnit karata he ki prakaash kii aavritiyaan tab kis tarah "sthanantarit" ho jaati hai, jab ek prakaash strot paryvekshak ke saapeksh gum rahaa hota he
 If f is the emitted frequency of a monochromatic light source, it will appear at the f frequency when it is moving relative to the observer
 jahaan v paryvekshak ke rest frem main veg kaa strot he, to θ veg sadish or paryvekshak strot disha ke bich kaa kone he or si prakaash kii gati he
 This is a completely relativistic formula and can be simplified in special cases of objects that are moving in a straight direction or away from the observer and have a much lower speed than C

 However, simply scaling each frequency like this is not enough
 hamen dikh rahe vivar ke parimit aakaar kaa hisaab rakhana hota he, kyonki prakaash praapt kar rahaa thos kone bhi lorentj ke badlaav se prabhavit hota he
 When this effect is included, it is found that the black body at temperature t is decreasing with the v velocity, which seems to have the same spectrum as the black body stationary at t temperature
 jaise In a case in which the source is moving directly towards or away from the observer, it is reduced yahan v >0 sanket karata he ki yah kam ho rahaa strot he or v <0 nikat aa rahe strot kii ore sanket karata he
 This is an important influence in astronomy, where the velocity of stars and galaxies can reach significant degrees of c

 It is believed that this is evident from the idea that the native people of the indo-germanic language and their descendants established a specific caste or large white race

 In his various short stories, novels, short novels, Paul Anderson, an anti-racist libertarian eunuch of Scandinavian descent, has repeatedly used the term Aryan as a synonym for the indo-european people
 unhone aryan ko ek aisi shikari chidiya kaha he jo inhen duusare grahon par ja kar vaahan apana kabja karne ko prerit karti he or anya grah pranali main upnivesh nivasaneey grah or nae upniveshwaad grah ke daur main unhen agrani udhmi ke taur par pesh karne ke liye protsaahit karti he
 The term Aryan is commonly used for Indians and Europeans or, to a lesser extent, Indians and Iranians, although many scholars today find this definition useless and politically incorrect in content-based older scholarship, but it is often mentioned in older books
 Such as the Scientific American by author Colin Renfrieu in 1989, in which the use of the term "aryan" was a traditional indo-eur Bilateral done for people
 19veen shatabdi main maanav-jati ke vigyaan ko kuch vidwaanon dwaara vaigyanik naslvaadi pravriti ke pratik ke taur par dikhalaayaa jaataa he, "arya vanshiyon" ko bhaaropee jati ke up-samooh ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo mul rup se hind europee bhashaa bhashaa ke bolne vaale the, jinke vanshaj portugali, hind europee the, jo europe, asian rus, anglo-america, dakshini dakshin america, dakshini africa, australia mahadweep, newjiland, armenia, greater iran or uttari bharat, or dakshini asia ke nepal, srilanka or maldweep main rahete the
 In the early 19th and 20th centuries the term Aryan referred to "portuguese-indian Germans and their descendants"
 Max Muller was often recognized as the first writer to use the term Aryan "caste" in English
 1861 main die gaye apane lectures on da science of language main usne aryan shabd kaa istemaal "res of pipul" ke rup main kiya, yani logon kii jati ke taur par kiya
 At that time, the term caste was used for clan or homogeneous group
 jab mular ke kathan ke anusaar aryan logon ko maanav-jati kaa ek vishesh samooh kaha jane laga to usne ye saafe kiya kii uskaa arth vanshaj se he na kii vishesh nasl se, usne kaha ki bhashaa-shaastra or maanav-vigyaan kaa mishran ek khatarnaak siddhant he
 He said that "linguistics and anthropology cannot be very different 


 but i must repeat what i have said many times before that it is wrong to call Aryan blood with a long head
 " usne apane virodh ko 1888 main likhe apane lekh biography of vards and da home of da aaryaas main bhi doharaaya
 Muller's response to this development of ethnic anthropology was, in fact, for the economer de Gobiniou, who believed that the indo-europeans represent the best race
 baad ke kai lekhak jaise francisi lekhak Vacher de Lapouge, ne apni kitaab l'aryen, main ye tark detaa he ki is visisth jati ko shirishya suchi kaa prayog kar or anya sanketakon se unke shaareerik banaavat se bhi pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 He argued that long-headed Europeans were found in northern Europe, which generally ruled people with "brachiocephalic"
 
 The division of white-born Aryans is purely a linguistic endeavor and not the starting point of anthropology, the focal point of the actual or natural division of anthropology, Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean, whereas linguistic etymology was the group whose relationship was Asian and African
 Was from the speakers
 haalanki baad main kuch maanav vigyanio or puraatatv mahiron ne "aryan" ke is bhashaayi vargeekaran ko chhetriyata se sambhddha kar diya, vishesh rup se uttari europe se
 In the 19th century, this idea gained considerable popularity
 19ve shatabdi ke madhya main kaha jane laga ki aaryon ki utpatti dakshin-pashchimi bhaag, jise aaj rus ke naam se janaa jaataa he, main hui
 But by the end of the 19th century, the logic of Aryan origins began to challenge the part, in which the idea of aryan origin was of ancient Germany or Scandinavia, the new argument began to prove the relation of Aryans to Germany or in the countries where aryan-kul The remains are found
 aaryon ke german mul ko, puratatvvetta gustaaf kojina ne pramukhataa se badhaava diya or daawa kiya ki proto-indo-european log niolithik germany ke corded ware samskruti ke samaan the
 In the 20th century, the intelligentsia propagated this argument fiercely, the concept of "choroid-noreadics"

 Germany's Rudolf Verchow theorized the study of dry skulls, he strongly contradicted the mystery of the Aryans' relation to the Nordic, northern Europe, in 1885 at the Congress of Archaeologists at Carlsruhe, in which the virtuoso's assistant, Joseph Coleman, said that Europeans, whether in England Be it German or French or Spanish, all are from mixed castes, in addition, he announced that the skull - According to science, no caste is better than anyone

 Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who was convinced of the superiority of the Aryans, responded in great detail to the arguments of Joseph Kollmann

 The model of indo-aryan migration refers to the prehistoric migration of the early indo-aryan settlements to their historic sites that were in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent and from there to the rest of the northern regions of India
 Much of the evidence of indo-aryan migration and de-conversion is linguistic, but tracing its migration with a set of original data from genetics, as well as Vedic religion, customs, poetry, social organizations, and some charioteer technicalities

 The issue of Dravidian caste is still very much disputed in India, from time to time it has sparked political and religious debate
 kuch dravid or dalit andolan ke samarthak, jo aam taur par tamil hai, kaa vishwaas he ki shiv ki puja karnaa sindhu sabhyataa se hi vishuddh dravidiya parampara he, jo aaryon ke hindu brahmanwad se bilkul bhinn he
 On the contrary, people associated with the Indian National Hinduism movement believe that the Aryans neither invaded or emigrated to any country, they insist that the Vedic ideology emanating from the Indus Valley Civilization, which was of indo-aryan Indicates arrival in India, it was in fact portuguese-dravidian culture
 british raaj ke dauraan kuch bhartiya bhi is bahes ke prabhaav main the
 Nationalist leader VD Savarkar believed that the "aryan race" migrated to India, but in the interpretation of racism he did not see any issue like "aryan race"
 Some nationalist leaders also supported the English side in this regard, because of this, their descendants began to meet the British

 While this is not the case with people of the lower caste, in 2009 the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology conducted a survey
 It tested about 132 people belonging to different groups of 25 castes in 13 states of India

 At the end of the nineteenth century Helena Blavatsky and Henry Olcott founded the Theosophy Creed, an attempt to understand the debate of occultism under this ideology
 ye vichaardhaara bhartiya samskruti se prabhavit he, shaayad hindu sudhaarwadi andolan arya samaaj se isane prerana lee, jisaki buniyaad swami dayanand ne daali thi
 Blavatsky calls the descendants of humanity a series of "root races", according to him, the fifth number in this series comes from Aryan
 uskaa maananaa he ki aryan atlantis se aaye the, iskaa zikr wo is tarah karti he: Blavatsky uses one of the technical terms "root race" to describe human evolution for the greater time of his world science
 haalanki, usne daawa kiya ki kuch log aise the jo aryan kii tulana main tuchh the
 She consistently distinguishes "aryan" from "semitic" culture, stating that Semitics are a sub-branch of Aryan, with "a lack of spirituality and a multiplicity of materiality
" " uskaa kahana he ki kuch jatiyaan jaanwaron ke samaan hai
 In them, she mentions "people from parts of the Tasmania state of Australia and the mountainous regions of China
" " iske alaava lemuro-atlantic logon kaa kaaphi mishran bhi he jaise borneo ke junglee log, silon ke vedhas, jinhen pro flower ne arya kaha
 Despite all this, Blavatsky's supporters do not consider her thinking to be hangman or racist, believing that she speaks of Vishwa Bandhutva and that "the core of spirituality and biology is one", "the root of all humans and its essence is one" 
 In The Secret Doctrine Blavatsky writes that everyone's blood is the same, but their essence is not the same
 blavatski apane puure lekhan main aadhyatmik vishshataaon ke saath shaareerik vansh ko jodatii he: According to Blavatsky, "MONADS of the lowest specimens of humanity" has no karma for work when he was first born, because his brothers had more intelligence on the side
 " He also predicted the destruction of the castes as "the failure of nature" in the future to elevate the "upper caste": yah dhyaan dena kaaphi dilachasp he ki paanchavi yaa aryan mul jati kaa dwitiya up-shakha, arbian ko brahmavidyavadiyon dwaara aryan kii upashakha ke rup main mana gaya he
 It is believed by theologians that Arabs, although traditional theologians assert the authority of the Aryan dynasty and adopted the Semitic languages of those who came from Atlantis in the past)
 Theologians asserted that Jews were born as Arabian subcontinent who are now Yemen in 30,000 BC
 sabase pehle ve somalia gaye or baad main misr jahaan ve musa ke samay tak rahe
 Thus, according to the teachings of theology, the Jewish people are part of the Aryan dynasty

 Guido von List later took some of Blavatsky's ideas and combined his ideas with the ideas of nationalist and fascist; This type of idea became known as Arisophy
 arisophi main yah mana jaataa tha ki tutanic anya sabhi logon main shreshthatar the kyonki brahmavidya ke anusaar tutonic yaa nordic aryan mul jati ke viksit jati kii sabase haal kii upjati he
 Such an idea is shown in the development of Nazi ideology
 da aryan path jaise theosophical prakashnon main naji ke prayog kaa joardaar virodh kiya gaya he or yah jatvaad par prahaar karata he
 The idea of the northern origins of the Aryans is particularly influenced in Germany
 yah vyapak rup se mana jaataa tha ki "vaidic aryaayi" jaateey aadhaar par goth, vandal or volkarwanderang ke pracheen germany ke log ke samroop hote hai
 This idea was often intertwined with the anti-semitic idea
 aryaayi or sami logon ke bich purvokt bhashaai or jaateey itihaas ke aadhaar par bhed he

e
,a hundred and twenty five per cent hero' Some other sources state that the title of 'sawai' was not given by Aurangzeb but by Emperor Farrukh Sayar
 par yah baat adhikansh granthon main aurangzeb ke saath judy milti he
 Jaisingh II was born Margashirsha Vadi on 7 November 1745, on 3 November 1688 from Raja Vishnusingh's Rathore Queen, Indrakanwar, daughter of Thakur Keshari Singh of Kharwa in Ajmer

 The news of Bishan Singh's death in Kabul reached the royal camp of Maharashtra on 18 February 1700, usually one and a half months after his death, then two days later, the emperor Aurangzeb changed the name of his eldest son from Vijay Singh to Jai Singh, Accepted the heir to the throne of Amer
 badshaah ne jaisingh ke chote bhai cheema ji kaa naam vijaisingh rakhaa
 According to Yadunath Sarkar "


 Jai Singh remained in Amer since his return from the south in July 1698, when the emperor also sent a number of 'strict calls' to attend him
 From his father's time, the delhi-emperor
 They wanted to call them in the south to take their military service
 parantu raja vishnusingh apane putr ko dakshin main nahin bhejnaa chaahate the
 But in 1698, he went to Maharashtra on the pressure of the emperor
 aath maheene mogul shivi main rah kar ye vaapis apni rajdhani amer laut aaye
 Immediately after sitting on the throne, as noted above, he was called in November 1700 to fight with his army in the south as an army of Mughal emperors, but somehow Jaising continued to evade
 vah jab kai shahi-adeshon kii avhelnaa kar chuke, to antat inhen 'jabaran' le aane ko badshaah ne kuch harkare amer tak bhi bheje| inaki anupasthiti se naaraaz badshaah aurangzeb ne in se amer raja kaa khitaab to nahin chhina, par 13 sitambar 1701 ko inhen 'padaavnat' karte hue maatr 500 jaat, 100 savaar kaa maamuli manasabadaar bana diya
 He was appointed as his military aide for the protection of Panhala near Aurangzeb's grandson Shah Bidarbakht when he reached the south in October 1701, battling difficult routes and rain-blocked routes
 aurangzeb ke pote shah bidarbakht ke netritv main baadashahi sena ne 11 may i0 1702 ko khilanaa ke kile par baari hamalaa kiya
 In this Amer and Mughal combined forces suffered a lot of casualties, but by breaking its walls, the first Kachwaha army of Jai Singh entered the Blossom-fort
 uski burj par amer kaa 'pancharanga jhanda' fahraaya gaya
 
 khilanaa-yuddh main inkaa vir or bharosemand dewan buddhasingh maaraa gaya
 On this blossom-conquest, King Aurangzeb raised his mansab to 2000, first after the request of Shah Bidarbakht
 badshaah kii chah saal kii 'kathin seva' kaa mahaz yah pratidaan jaisingh ko mila! iske baad jab shahjada bidarbakht malwe kaa soobedaar hua, tab usne jaisingh kii sevaaon kaa sammaan karte un ko vahaan kaa naayab soobedaar bana diya, jise aurangzeb ne tatkaal hi 'naamanzoor' kar diya tathaa ek farmaan likhaa ki ainda kisi hindu bhi ko maamuli faujadaar tak bhi nahin banaaya jaae
 ' vidmbana haratangez he ki jis aurangzeb ne kabhi inhen 'savai' kah kar sammaan diya vahi baad main vastutah inase is kadar naaraaz or purvaagrahagrast tha ki usne ye apmanjanak ajna jari kii- "jaisingh ko masanad par asana na de kar, neeche zamin par bichhi 'sujani' par baithne ko kaha jaay!" Meanwhile, in AD 1704, two Badshahi Faujdars took local help and snatched the fief from Thakur Kushal Singh Rajawat to the Jhilaiya hideout located in Sawai Madhopur on 13 November 1704
 duusare saal i0 1705 main shah bidarbakht ne apni taraf se inke paksh main phir se koshish karke jaisingh ko malwa kaa bhi naayab soobedaar banavaa diya
 But as long as Aurangzeb survived, his influence in the Mughal camp remained mild
 i0 1707 main 21 farvari ko aurangzeb ke dehanth ke baad mogul-gaddi ke liye uske beton main vikat-sangharsh shuru ho gaya
 Shah Azam invaded Agra and Delhi
 us samay tak usne inkaa mansab 5000 jaat 500 savaar kaa kar diya tha
 On June 18, 1707, the battle of Jaju took place 20 miles south of Agra between the armies of Maujam and Azam

 , jaisingh ke chote bhai vijaisingh, badshaah ko khush karne ke liye apni bahan kaa vivaah badshaah bahadurshah se karwaanaa chaahate the
 He sent the news of this to Delhi and stopped Buddha Singh Hada on his way on leave and got him married in Samode

 In January 1708, he reached Amer and took it to Khalsa
 jaisingh se amer kii jaagir jabt karke badshaah bahadurshah dwaara 10 janvari 1708 ko unke chote bhai vijaisingh ko anekanek mahange uphaaron sahit de di gayi
 Sawai Jaisingh's political stature was reduced to a modest 'mansabdar'
 badshaah iske baad ajmer hokar dakshin ke liye apane bhai kambaksh se muqabla karne ko badha
 Both the kings of Amber and Jodhpur went with him to the area of mandleshwar
 jab unhen yah aashaa nahin rahi ki badshaah unke ilaake unhen waapas lautaaega to unhone durgadas rathod kii raay se, jab badshaah narbada nadi paar karne ko ravaanaa hua, 20 april 1708 baishakh sudi 13 ko baadashahi-shivi chhod diya or ve raajapootaana kii ore waapas ravaanaa hokar mewar udaipur pahunche

 Two armies were sent from Joghpur to take control of the Amer ruled by Vijay Singh

 In the Second Army, Maharaja Jai singh's Diwan Ram Chandra and Shyam Singh had 20,000 cavalry
 inkaa ratanpura ke paas amer ke faujadaar hossain khan se yuddh hua, jisamen unhone use parrast karke amer par apana adhikaar kar liya

 The nerds attacked him suddenly with guns and arrows
 usamen sab mogul faujadaar maare gayi tathaa mughalon kii jiti hui baaji haath se nikal gai
 Then Jai Singh wrote a letter against the emperor to Durgadas that "speak to Udaipur Maharana 


 Rajputs should do what the pride of 'hindustan' should do against the Mughals, including the Marathas
 " When Emperor Bahadur Shah returned from the south, he considered it necessary to somehow compromise both the Jodhpur and Amer kings
 inhen laane ke liye usne budhsingh haada raja bundi ko bheja, jinke marfat 21 june i0 1710 ko ye ajmer ke paas badshaah ke saamne hajir hue
 The emperor returned the seized states to them and also gave the mansab of 4000 and 4000 riders to these two
 us samay tak bhi rajputon kaa mughalon par bilkul vishwaas nahin tha, isliye jab savai jaisingh ajmer main badshaah ke shivi main gayi tab ajmer ke tamaam pahaad tathaa ghaatiyaan rajput-sainikon se bhari hui thim
 He never had full faith in Bahadur Shah's intention even after Mansab grew and returned to the area
 jaisingh ke bhai vijaisingh ke saath bhi kuch aisa hua ki niraash hokar ant main mughal darbar chhod kar hindun aa gaye
 Jai Singh was still an armed rebellion threat from brother Vijay Singh
 inhone 1713 i0 main vijaisingh se samjhauta karne or 'rajmata se bhent' karne ke naam par apane sashastr sainikon evam saradaaron samet sanganer ja kar dhokhe se unako kaid karvaa diya or jaigarh kile main bhej diya
 Shyam Singh Khangarot was a special assistant in this 'assassination' of Vijay Singh
 bahadur shah kii mrityu ke baad uske uttaradhikari jahandarshah ne amer or marwar donon raajaaon ko phir apane paksh main karnaa chaha
 He also gave the mansab of 7000 castes and 7000 riders to both, but this time they decided to stay away from Aurangzeb's sons in the mutual struggle between the Mughal heirs
 farrukh sier ke mogul badshaah banane ke baad hossain ali saiyad ne shyamsingh khangarot ko bulawaaya tathaa unase baat karke jaisingh ko badshaah se 5000 jaat 4500 savaar kaa mansab dilvaaya
 When At Singh differed with the emperor, the emperor sent Syed Hussain Ali with his army to Ajmer, where Attingh was captured
 us samay jaisingh bhi hossain ali saiyad ke saath the
 In the end there was a treaty with At Singh
 oktober 1713 i0 main inhen badshaah farrukh sier ne malwa kii soobedaari pradaan kii
 He suppressed many rebellions there and also suppressed the nuisance of the marines
 marahathon kii ek badi sena jab malwe main ghusi tab inhone palsood ke paas use badi karaari haar di
 Marathi army men fled and stayed in Palsud
 jaisingh ne raat main hi un par hamalaa kar diya
 Seeing his army, he escaped and crossed the Nervada River
 unki lut kaa sab maal vahiin rah gaya
 Chhatrasal Bundela was also with him in Malwa
 1715 i0 main inako dilli bula liya gaya
 Then in his absence, he put his Dhabhai Ruparam there as a hero
 1717 tak ye malwa ke soobedaar rahe
 Emperor Farrukh Sier gave the princely state of Bundi to Bhimsingh Hada king Kota and he also captured Bundi
 jaisingh ne prayaas karke badshaah se bundi waapas raja budhsingh hada ko dilvaayi
 The emperor from Delhi ordered them to climb Chudaman Jat of Bharatpur, which had caused a great disturbance in the area of agra from looting
 inke saath bundi ke buddhasingh, kota ke bhimsingh, narvar ke gajsingh, durgadas rathod va kai anya manasabadaar bhi niyukt kiye gayi
 On 15 September 1716, he took his army and left for Mathura
 navambar main chudaaman ke prasiddh kile thun kaa gheraa shuru kiya
 Var Abdullah Khan was against Syed, Jaysingh and was helping Chudaman
 isse inhen is abhiyaan main safalataa nahin mil pai
 Var Abdullah Khan Syed finally took up the circle of Thun after falling in between
 may 1718 main jaisingh kii vaapasi dilli hui
 Despite this failure in the area of chudaman, he was respected by the emperor
 saiyadon or baadshahon ke bich talavaarein khinch chuki thi
 Jaisingh persuaded Emperor Farrukh Sayar that he should be cleaned forever after fighting the Syed
 us samay unke paas 20 hajaar rajput savaar dilli main maujuud the tathaa bundi ke buddhasingh hada bhi unheen ke saath the
 But the king did not dare to take this military action
 vah saiyadon ko kisi tarah khush karne main laga rahaa
 Finally, the Sayyids asked the emperor Jaisingh to leave Delhi
 jaisingh ne badshaah ko sachet kiya ki unke jane se badshaah kii jaan ko khatra ho jayega lekin yah salaah badshaah kii samaj main nahin ai
 Jaisingh left Delhi on 13 February 1719 AD
 uske kuch hi ghanton baad bheenmasingh kota raja ne budhsingh bundi par akraman kar diya
 His loyal devotee Sardar Jait Singh with great valor stopped the army of Kota and removed Budh Singh from there safely
 ve bhaag kar savai jaisingh ke paas pahunche
 On April 17- 18, Syed brothers, At Singh Jodhpur and Bhimsingh Kota together killed the emperor Farrukhsiyar in Delhi
 jaisingh ne elahabaad ke soobedaar chhabila ram or nizaam se saiyadon ke viruddh bhi patr-vyavhaar kiya
 They wanted everyone to oust the Sayyids together
 inhone chhatrasaal bundela ko bhi yuddh ke liye bulaayaa
 The Sayyids sent several armies to surround them from many sides
 On 5 July, Var Abdullah Khan, along with the nominal Emperor Rafiudullah, marched on Jai Singh and reached Agra via Mathura, where rebellion against the Sayyids was taking place
 jaisingh ne bhi saiyadon se puure taur se muqabla karne kii taiyaari kar lee thi par yuddh main ravaanaa hone ke pehle unhone brahmanon ko bulaakar amer rajya daan main de diya or kesaria bana dhaaran karke ve saiyadon se ladaai ke liye ravaanaa hue
 They had reached Toda Raisingh from Amer
 par nizaam or chhabilaram donon hi vaayade ke anusaar inke paksh main kaayam nahin rahe
 Jaisingh felt disappointed
 ant main atsingh jaisingh ko apane saath jodhpur le gayi jahaan unhone apni putree kaa jaisingh se vivaah kiya
 The Syed gave Rs 20 lakh to Jaisingh, so that they could buy Amber back from the Brahmins
 us samay bhi jaisingh ko atsingh jodhpur par vishwaas nahin tha isliye ve apane vivaah main bhi jirahabakhtar pahan kar gayi the
 When the two Sayyid forces were defeated by the Nizam in the south, Hussain Ali Khan Syed, accompanied by Emperor Mohammad Shah, proceeded to suppress the Nizam with a large army
 sitambar 8, 1720 i0 ko todabhim main usne hossain ali ko dhokhe se maar daalaa
 Now the emperor prepared and mounted Syed Abdullah Khan who was in Delhi
 is yuddh ke liye maharana ne jaisingh se poocha ki 'use kya karnaa chahie?' jaisingh ne udapur ke maharana ko badshaah kii madad karne ke liye patr likhaa tathaa saath main hi maharana ke alaava bikaner, kota or raav indrasingh nagaur ko bhi badshaah kii madad karne ke liye patr bheje
 Sawai Jaisingh himself sent a good army with Rao Jagram to help the emperor Mohammad Shah
 is sena main savai ram, gadhi gajsingh, naruka jaavali, jaswantsingh, sawairam ke putr, pratapsingh kalyanot, buddhasingh kalyanot, gulab singh kalyanot, chhitarsingh kalyanot, amarsingh rajaavat, bahadur singh khangoraat or sardarsingh naruka aadi sardaar the
 On 3 and 4 November 1720, there was a war in which Syed Abdullah Khan was captured
 vijay ke baad badshaah ne jaipur ke saradaaron ko apane haath se khichhaten deen
 Mohammad Shah, on reaching Delhi, sent Jaisingh an order to come to Delhi, in which he wrote that he has to take advice on many important problems
 usne dilli pahunchane par badshaah ne apane naye var mohammad amin khan ko unke dere par lene bheja
 On coming to the court, the emperor gave him a big welcome and gave many gifts
 unke mansab main 4000 savaar or badha die gaye
 On this occasion, he gave them two crores of rupees in reward / money which he humbly refused to take
 par badshaah ne savai jaisingh or raja giradhar bahadur ke anurodh par hiduon par lagaaya jane vaala kathin jajia kar maaf kar diya
 Maharana Mewar sent a written congratulation to Sawai Jaisingh on his success to give Jaziya Hatwa
 saiyadon ke patan ke baad jaisingh kaa rajnatik mahatv tezi se badhane laga
 The kings of Rajasthan, Malwa and Bundelkhand wanted help and advice from them in every trouble
 in ilaakon main inaki raay ke bagaiyr kuch bhi nahin hota tha
 After 1735 AD, the Marathas also started taking their advice and respecting them
 inhen savai ke alaava mogul baadshahon ne jo anya oopaadhiyaan samay samay par deen ve thim - saramde –raja-e- hind' / 'rajrajeshwar' / 'shrirajadhiraj aadi
 In September 1722, Jaisingh was sent as the Subedar of Agra to suppress the Jats
 inke saath 50 hajaar sainikon kii badi fouj thi tathaa anek manasabadaar bhi inke saath the
 The royal artillery was also with him
 chudaaman jat kaa putr mohakamsingh is samay jaaton kaa netaa tha
 But Chudaman's nephew Badansingh, who was angry with him, met Jai Singh
 inhone uskaa bada swaagat-satkar kiya
 Once again, they besieged the fort of Thun
 atsingh joghpur ne ek sena mohakamsingh kii madad ke liye bheji, parantu vah jobaner se aage nahin badi
 Like Vibhishan, the victory of the fort of Thun looked certain with the advice of Badansingh
 tab mohakamsingh niraash hokar gupt maarg se kila chhod kar atar singh ke paas jodhpur pahunchaa
 But Sawai Jai Singh had the right over the Jat fort at Thun
 inhone surajmal ke pita badansingh ko bharatpur kii jaagir di tathaa raja ke rup main unke pagadi baandhi
 On June 19, 1723, Thakur Badansingh Jat signed a handwriting to this effect by 'serving the Jaipur Darbar' and accepting an annual offer of Rs 83 thousand
 badansingh jaipur ke dashahra darbar main har saal aayaa karte the
 In Jaipur, where the king of Deeg, including the Jat army, used to stay, the place is still called Bas Badanpura

 According to the orders of the Maharaja, the map of the new city was made by Diwan Vidyadhar, who was a very talented Bengali Brahmin and was a naib-auditor in the service of his accounting department
 san 1733 i0 main yah nagar, jiskaa naam savai jaisingh ne ' savai jayanagar' rakhaa ban kar taiyaar hua
 Jaisingh was made the Subedar of Malwa again by the Mughal emperor
 ve 23 oktober 1729 i0 ko ujjain ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Jaisingh wanted to compromise the rebellious marines for the protection of his kingdom
 inke is samjhauta-prastaav ko badshaah ne bhi sweekaar kar liya tha
 On this victory, he had read and written with Sahu
 sahu iske liye taiyaar ho gaya tha, kintu peshwa log is samjhaute ke zyada paksh main nahin tha
 He sent Deep Singh Kumbhani to Sahura near Sahu
 lautate samay deepasingh nizaam se bhi mila, parantu sitambar 1730 i0 main inke malwa kii soobedaari se hat jane se vah samjhauta nahin ho sakaa
 The relationship of Jai Singh became very bad with Bundi King Buddha Singh when Buddha Singh Bundi and his Kachwahi queen created serious differences among themselves
 ant main sambandh itane bigade ki jaisingh ne badshaah ko kah kar buddhasingh ke sthaan par karwaad ke saalim singh hada ke putr dalelsinh ko bundi kaa raja banavaa diya or baad main apni putree bhi use byaah di
 This led to a long and painful struggle between Jaipur and Bundi in Rajasthan
 is aapasi manmutav se marahathon ko phir rajasthan main hastkshep karne kaa avasar mil gaya
 Jai Singh got information in Malwa in 1730 that Buddha Singh was going to take control of Bundi again
 inhone ek sena dalelsinh kii madad ko bheji| 6 april 1730 ko kushattal pancholas main budhsingh se jaipur sena kaa yuddh hua jisamen jaipur ke paanch rajaavat sardaar fatahsingh sarsope khojuram, saanvaldas, achalsinh or ghasiram achare maare gaye
 
 is yuddh main buddhasingh ko vijay nahin mili
 On his return from Malwa, Maharaja Sawai Jaisingh Kushtal went to Pancholas
 unhone vahaan maare gayi saradaaron kii maatami karke unke putron ko siropav aadi diye
 Jaisingh went to Ujjain for the third time in December 1732 as Subedar of Malwa province
 is baar malwa main bhi marahathon kaa utpaat itnaa bad gaya tha ki malwa se marahathon ko nikaalane ke inke tamaam prayaas vifal rahe
 In 1734, Khandaura came forward against Marathon in Malwa via Rajputana with a large army
 jaisingh, abhayasingh aadi anek raja unke saath the
 When this huge army reached Rampura, he got marhtas
 par ve chhutput ladaaiyon ke baad inhen chaka kar peeche se rajasthan main ghus gayi
 There was no one to stop them and they went on to plunder the Marathas for a long time in the state of Jaipur
 1735 i0 main peshwa bajirao kii maan uttar main tirth karne ai
 Maharaja Jai singh gave him great respect and got him also treated by Maharana
 agra main inke naayab soobedaar ne apane dewan aayamal ke bhai narayandas ko uskaa swaagat karne va puna tak saath jane kii ajna bheji
 On January 1737, Peshwa came to North India, along with him were Holkar, Sindhia, Panwar etc
 udaipur se aate samay peshwa se 25 farvari ko maharaja jaisingh malpura kshetra ke jhadli gaanv main mili
 He gave them many things
 bajirao dilli tak jaakar waapas laut gaya
 Maharaja Jai singh felt very sad due to the death of Bajirao Peshwa
 nayaa peshwa balarao bana
 In 1741, Jai Singh was the Subedar of Agra when the new Maratha Peshwa Bala Rao ascended to the north
 inaki or naye peshwa bala raav kii dhaulpur main bhent hui
 With his efforts, the emperor gave the Peshwa the suburb of Malwa
 jab nadirshah bharat main aayaa tab sabhi ko badi shankaa khadi ho gai
 The Peshwa, Maharana, along with other kings and Bundelas, wanted to organize an organized fight with Jaysingh, Nadirshah
 haalanki 24 farvari 1739 ko karnal main vah mogul sena ko buree tarah parajeet kar chukaa tha
 It was also rumored that Nadir Shah would go to Ajmer via Jaipur
 yah jaisingh ke liye bhi bada khatra tha
 All were alert, but in the end he returned home from Mathura
 "nadirshah ne jab bharat par hamalaa kiya tab dilli kii sahaytarth jaisingh nahin gaye
 The reason for this was - the Nizam and Qamruddin were in high positions in the empire at that time and they could be suspected to be responsible for Nadirshah's attack, but the Emperor kept believing in them and kept giving them necessary advice
 " In the court of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, many original compositions were made in the fields of Sanskrit and Brajbhasha literature, architecture, theology, astrology, astronomy, history-writing, etc
 and this academic contribution of the entire Indian Manisha was greatly enhanced
