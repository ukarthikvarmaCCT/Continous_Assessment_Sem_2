 Actually Aamir Khan and his 'pani Foundation' have shown the tax which the government and administration have not been able to do
 bina ek rupaya kharchaa kiye aamir khan or unki sanstha ne 116 gaanv main jal sangrakshan ke bahut bade paimaane par kaam kar dikhaaya he, jinaki sarkari keemat 272 karod he, or ye kaha he khud maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ne
 This is how the 'pani Foundation' NGO was founded, Amir Khan said that due to his schoolmate's childhood friend Satya, his inclination towards social work increased from films
 satyamev jayate ke baad hamen samaj aayaa ki bharat badalanaa chahta he
 After three seasons, decided to work on water and start from Maharashtra
 iske baad pani sanstha kii sthapana kii gai
 Water conservation in 116 villages of Maharashtra state through this social organization 'water Foundation'
 bina paise kharch kiye jal sangrakshan kaa kaamravivaar ke din pune main rajyabar se aae bhartiya jain sanghatana ke kaaryakartaaon ko maargdarshan dete hueamir khanbhole ki unki ye swayan sanstha sirf logon ke bich ke sanchaarak (communicators ) he
 People have done the rest
 aamir ne bataaya ki main daraa bhi tha, man duvidha main tha ki agar isamen safalataa nahin mili to, lekin dedh saal ke bheetar 116 gaanv main ye jal sangrakshan kaa pehla kaam puraa hua he
 Has worked in three tehsils
 ab teen se tees tahseelon main hamen janaa he
 Round two requires ten times more resources

 aamir or unki team maanati he ke baandh samaadhaan nahin hai, kyonki desh ke bade 40 % baandh rajya main hone ke baavjood rajya ke 18% ilaake main hi isse sinchai hui he
 Decentralization of water is the only solution and hence the work that Aamir Khan's water body is doing is helping to pour water right into the ground
 ye second round bahut jaruri he, kyonki 30 se 300 gaanvon tak pahunchnaa yani scale baraabar hona chahie
 Water conservation training will be taught by Aamir Khan's water body experts
 or phir se spardhaa lee jaaengi
 The Chief Minister of Maharashtra believed that the government's plan would fail, and if the plan of the public would succeed
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ko jab aamir khan ne unke man kii baat bataai to mukhyamantri ne jhat se aamir ke saamne rajya ke jalayukt shivaar yojana kaa brands ambesder banane kaa prastaav rakhaa, lekin aamir khan ne brands ambesder banane ke bajaay khud jalasancharan kaa kaam karnaa chunaa or karke bhi dikhaaya

 ) If there is a fire in the narrow and narrow streets of Varanasi, what will happen is that this question may come in your mind
 lekin ab isse nipatane ke liye varanasi kaa fire brigade taiyaar he, kyonki uske daste main in sankari galiyon main jane ke liye motor cycle fire brigade dasta jo shaamil ho gaya he
 Not only this, fire squad is also ready in jeep instead of big vehicles, which will work to control the fire in narrow streets
 syran bajaati motor cycle fire brigade kaa dasta banaras kii sankari galiyon main aag lag jane kii soochna aate hi fouran use kaabo paane ke liye nikal padataa he
 Traffic jam is also a big problem in Banaras, but this jam does not trap people who are on bicycle or motor cycle and they have knowledge of the streets of Benaras
 ye fire brigade dasta motor cycle par hai or inhen ek duusare se judi galiyon kaa gyaan bhi he, lihaaja ye log chand minuton main hi in sankari galiyon main pahunch jate hai or apane peeche lage pani or chemical se bhare container ko lekar makaan ke jis bhi hisse aag main lagi hoti he us par foran kaabo paa lete hai
 It is very similar to a common motorcycle
 isamen khaas baat he, isamen lage hue do silendar, hooter syran, lite or aag par kaabo paane ke liye 9 litre pani ke saath fom chemical
 If the fire is small, it is controlled only by this much, if it is not able to come, then by filling it, use it
 yah dasta iske alaava apane saath alag se chemical liye rahete hai
 In the last few months, about 15 times the cylinders and other small fires have been extinguished before becoming larger
 gauratlab he ki banaras sankari galiyon kaa shahar he, jahaan ek badi aabaadi basati he
 The roads connecting these narrow lanes are not so wide as to allow a large fire brigade to go in, so there is a water mist for it as well as a presser jeep
 isamen 200 litre pani ke tanks ke saath 50 litre chemical fom kaa tanks hai or isame 30 meter lanbaa paip he, jise jod kar 90 meter kiya ja saktaa he
 He serves as the backup behind these motorcycle squads
 itnaa hi nahin banaras ab pradhanmantri kaa sansadeey kshetra bhi he
 The fire brigade here is fully prepared to fight the fire
 italy se taqariban saadhe chaar karod kii laagat vaale 42 meter lambey hydrolink platform vaale fire brigade kii gaadi bhi ai he, jo abhi puure pradesh main banaras ke baad sirf lakhanu main hi he
 With this brigade, the changing picture of Banaras will help in the fire of large building, resuscitation of people
 haalanki aag se nipatane kii chunauti har vakt badi rahi he or yahi vajah he ki nai nai takanic izaad hoti ja rahi he
 In the city of Benares, this challenge gets bigger, but the arrival of this fire brigade squad is giving some relief
 bas zaroorat he or motor cycle daste kii jisase banaras kii galiyon main aag se nipatane kii mukkammal vyavastha ho sake

 For the people of Delhi, Metro is not only a ride of pride, but also an easy and better means of travel
 isliye to dilli metro main bheed lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 But the biggest problem facing the passengers of Metro is the last mile connectivity
 matlab ghar se metro stesan yaa metro stesan se daftar tak pahunchnaa sabase badi dikkat hoti he
 Keeping this in mind, now Delhi Metro has launched new e-rickshaws for last mile connectivity, which are different from the common e-rickshaws
 ek saal main chalenge 610 i-rikhshaye dizine i rickshaw payalat project ke taur par abhi ek stesan par hi chalaaya jayega
 Currently, five e-rickshaws have been requisitioned for Vaishalimetro station, which will provide feeder service to the passengers in the range of three to four kilometers
 dilli metro rail korporation (dmarsi) ke emdi mongu singh ke mutabik dilli metro kaa lakshya ek saal ke bheetar isi tarah ke 610 i-rickshaw chalaane kaa he
 Rickshaws are being run as an experiment at Vaishali Metro station, soon e-rickshaws will also be started at Noida and Gurugram stations
 i-rickshaw main laga hoga sisitivi camera or jeepiesadelli metro kii feader seva ke taur par chalaae ja rahe in rickshaw main sisitivi camera or jeepies bhi laga hoga
 So that they can be monitored and made safe for women travelers in the night or in deserted areas
 philhal dmarsi 42 rooton par 291 feader basen chalaa rahi he, lekin ye musafiron ko last mil connactivity dene ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 So now dmrc's plan is to give bicycle on rent and to run e-rickshaws for narrow streets

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi today hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused the NDA government of having 'dictatorial' tendencies

 Amidst the party's fight over the issue of curbing the declining mass base of the Congress and the debacle that began in the Lok Sabha elections, Sonia Gandhi asked senior party leaders to suggest ways and measures to reach the public in the meeting
 said
 yah baithak bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh or kisaanon se jude duusare muddon ko lekar deshvyapee andolan shuru karne kii yojanaon par charchaa karne ke liye hui thi
 On the issue of ordinance, Sonia said that the democratic institutions of the country are being ignored
 bhaajapa sarkaar ne apane saat maheene ke kaarykaal ke dauraan das adhyadesh jari karwaae hai
 He also questioned whether there is a hidden motive behind this haste (bringing ordinance) 
 party mukhyalay main kareeb chaar ghante chali congress kaarysmiti kii baithak main sanghathan par nae sire se vichaar karne kii baat hui he
 It was thought that in the coming days, the tenure of the Speaker should be done from five years to three years

 In the Congress Working Committee meeting, the expectation of a big announcement regarding Rahul Gandhi also proved to be wrong
 congress ke varisht mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne baithak ke baad saaf shabdon main kaha ki is mudde par koi charchaa nahin hui
 However, the Congress is looking at several changes within the organization as well
 iske liye vah apane samvidhan main bhi sanshodhan karegi
 The tenure of the Chairman, General Secretary and other organizational positions can be reduced from five years to three years
 lekin yah saafe he ki na sanghathan ke str par congress sonia- rahul kii pakad se dur ja rahi he or na vichaar ke str par wo koi nai baat soch paa rahi he
 The working committee decided that the party would oppose the Land Acquisition Ordinance, demand 50% reservation for tribals, Dalits and backward, undertake massive public relations campaigns and eliminate the need for separate membership for the party's separate wing

 Rajam Kapoor's granddaughter, a show full of passion, full of passion, has established a distinct identity in the world of Hindi films
 madhur bhandarkar kii film 'heroin' ke set par unhoncenusha subramanyanase baat kii
 Here are the major excerpts from the conversation with him: Do you feel any pressure on yourself due to the success achieved in recent days? Have people started expecting more from you? The pressure is naturally because everyone expects that every film of mine is worth 100 crores
 se zyada kii kamai kare
 But honestly, not every film can do this
 '3 idiyats'kaa bajet 25 karod ru
 Was and it did such a great business that no one had expected such a thing in the beginning
 'raa
 One 'and' Bodyguard 'were big budget films
 unhen is tarah se banaaya or prachaarit kiya gaya jisase box offis par badi kamai karnaa tay tha
 This does not mean that i am going to put pressure on my producers and directors that i have such a possibility, then sit and plan the film in such a way that we earn hugely from it
 main sirf vahi filmein karnaa chaahati hum jinhen karne main mujhe majaa aae
 After such a big success, did it happen that you got a lot of offers of advertisements? There are no two opinions
 bahut saare brands ne mujhase sampark saadhaa
 But i choose them carefully
 main sirf unheen chizon kaa vigyaapan karti hum, jinamein meraa yakeen he
 i advertise the same brands that suit my personality
 main jaanati hum, mujhe kya chahie or maine apni jindagi ko apni marji ke mutabik hi jiya he
 And this is completely different from the life of a star
 brands ke vigyaapan ke maamle main main abhi tak kaaphi khushkismat rahi hum kyonki ve companiyaan mere prati puri tarah se patibaddh rahi hai
 Tell us about a brand that has been in perfect harmony with your personality? Take Sony's Vaio laptop as an example
 soni vyo ne mere liye bhi kaaphi kuch kiya he
 i can say that i am the only actress to endorse the brand like Sony internationally
 soni vyo ke sies jiro ke vigyaapan main mujhe dekhne ke baad yah laptop desh bhar main charchaa kaa vishay ban chukaa he
 Even today mps know that what size is zero? All these things have helped me to a great extent along with the brand
 kisi bhi brands kaa vigyaapan karne se pehle aap kin teen chizon kaa khaas taur par khyaal rakhti hai?vah aisa koi saamaan ho, jiskaa vigyaapan maine pehle nahin kiya he
 This should match my personality
 or haa, paisa to acha milanaa hi chahie
 But i do not advertise alcohol nor any non-vegetarian food because i am a vegetarian
 aap kis tarah kii filmein dekhnaa pasand karti hai?main adhiktar angreji filmein dekhati hum
 i love Meryl Streep's films, especially her 'the Bridges of Madison County'
 'da godfadar' to khayr pasand he hi
 How do you see your career at this point? i feel that i am in that phase of career where i have the best brands and the best movies
 yah sab is vajah se hua he kyonki maine khud ko usee tarah se dhaal liya he
 It also cannot be ignored that whatever i do, i do with Dilozan
 kangana beshak soshal media par nahin hai, lekin unki bahan rangoli unki taraf se har baat kaa jawaab dene ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahati hai

 She tweets what she feels is right
 'rithik kaa bachaav karne vaali singer ko kangana kii bahan ne diya javabaapako bataa den ki beete kuch dinon se kangana or rithik ke relationships ko lekar soshal media par kaaphi bahes chal rahi he
 Kangana made several revelations about Hrithik and his relationship during an interview
 is par kuch phens ne jahaan unhen bold, bindaas or aatmavishvasi bataaya, vahiin kuch ne unki aalochana kii
 Some people had said that Kangana is gaining publicity by talking about it

 bharat ke purv captain rahul dravid ne champiens trophy main shandaar jeet ke liye mahendra singh dhoni kii team kii tarif karte hue kaha ki bhartiya team santulit he or shandaar fielding kii bhoomika khitaab dilaane main ahm rahi
 Dravid said, India was the best team
 ve nirnaayak sthiti main dabaav main nahin aae
 India's batting, the partnership between Kohli and Jadeja and bowling in the last over was superb
 bhartiya team final main behatar thi
 He said, India's greatest quality is its balance
 england ke halaat se ham hairaan hai
 How much spin the ball got and that helped India get down with seven batsmen as Jadeja came down at number seven
 pehle aisa nahin tha
 Dravid also praised India's fielding
 unhone kaha, bharat ne shandaar fielding kii
 No tournament always has the chance to say that India's fielding was the best
 bharatiyon kii maidan par urja kaabile tarif thi
 He said, the credit goes to the selectors
 kai baar ham unhen bhul jate hai, lekin unhone apane kaam ko bakhubi anjaam diya
 Many may have felt that this team lacked experience, but the players proved the selectors right
 champiens trophy main khitaabi jeet se bharat kaa 2015 vishwacap ke liye aatmavishvaas badhegaa, lekin dravid itnaa aage nahin sochna chaahate
 Dravid said, it is dangerous to think ahead
 bharat ke 2011 vishwacap jeetne ke baad kisne sochaa tha ki do saal baad hamaari team main unamem se sirf teen khilaadi honge
 This is a whole new team, so it is dangerous to think ahead
 team main ek tej gendbaaj harfanmaulaa kii jarurat par jor dete hue unhone ummid jataai ki irfan pathan agle do saal main yah jagah le sakate hai
 The comments unhone kaha, bharat ko ek tej gendbaaj harfanmaulaa kii jarurat he
 Since Kapil Dev and to a lesser extent Manoj Prabhakar, we have not got a fast bowler allrounder
 irfan aisa gendbaaj he, jo ek dedh saal main apni lay hasil karke yah kami puri kar saktaa he
 Dravid said visiting South Africa in November would be a tough challenge for India
 unhone kaha, yah alag tarah kii pariksha hogi
 We are number one in the ODI rankings, but are ranked fourth or fifth in Tests
 ham dakshin africa se peeche hai, lihaaja yah kathin chunauti hogi
 Especially if Dale Steyn, Morni Morkel and Vernon Philander fit
 dravid ne kaha, bharat sarvshereshth team thi
 They did not come under pressure in a decisive position
 bharat kii ballebaaji, kohli or jadeja ke bich saajhedaari or aakhri overon main gendbaaji shandaar thi
 The Indian team was better in the final
 unhone kaha, bharat kii sabase badi khubi uskaa santulan he
 We are surprised by the situation in England
 gend ko kitni spin mili or isse bharat saat ballebaajon ke saath utar sakaa chunki jadeja ne saatven number par utar rahe the
 This was not the case earlier
 dravid ne bharat kii fielding kii bhi tarif kii
 He said, India did a great fielding
 kisi toornament main hameshaa yah kehane kaa mauka nahin miltaa ki bharat kii fielding sarvshereshth thi
 The energy on the field of the Indians was commendable
 unhone kaha, iskaa shrey chayankartaaon ko jaataa he
 Many times we forget him, but he did his work well
 kai logon ko laga hoga ki is team main anubhav kii kami he, lekin khilaadiyon ne chayankartaaon ko sahi sabit kar diya
 a title win in the Champions Trophy will boost India's confidence for the 2015 World Cup, but Dravid does not want to think that far ahead
 dravid ne kaha, bahut aage kii sochna khatarnaak he
 After India won the 2011 World Cup, who thought that after two years our team will have only three of them
 yah puri nai team he, lihaaja bahut aage kii sochna khatarnaak he
 Emphasizing the need for a fast bowler all-rounder in the team, he hoped that Irfan Pathan could take this place in the next two years
 tippaniyan "india needs a fast bowler all-rounder," he said
 kapil dev or kuch had tak manoj prabhakar ke baad se hamen tej gendbaaj harfanmaulaa nahin mila
 Irfan is a bowler who can complete this shortfall by regaining his rhythm in one and a half years
 dravid ne kaha ki november main dakshin africa kaa daura bharat ke liye kathin chunauti hoga
 He said, it will be a different type of examination
 ranking main ham van-de main number van hai, lekin test main chauthe yaa paanchaven number par hai
 We are behind South Africa, so it will be a tough challenge
 khaskar agar del sten, morni morkal or vernon philander feet hue to

 The Congress has resigned from its current ministers and the last dice to save Kumaraswamy government has gone by making rebel party mlas ministers

 The beginning and end of Ramchella Paswan's day in Laxmanpur Bathe was seen by looking at the martyr's memorial in front of the door of the house
 us smarak par paswan ke saat parijanon ke bhi naam ankit hai
 On December 1, 1997, he somehow escaped becoming a victim of genocide
 unhen ummid thi ki unke parivaar ke hatyaron ko ek din sajaa jarur milegi
 But when he went to heaven five years ago for justice, his son Vinod Paswan did not give up hope
 ve insaaf ke liye police or court ke lagaataar chakkar laga rahe the
 Vinod was an eyewitness to the murder of his family
 unki jaan isliye batch pai ki unki bahan ne unhen kothi (anaaj rakhane kaa mitti kaa bartan) ke ek kone main soup se dhak diya tha
 His mother Rajrani Devi, four younger brothers and two sisters were killed by the killers
 ek disambar 1997 ko oonchi jatiyon kii pratibandhit ranvir sena ke logon ne unke gaanv main ghuskar 58 daliton kii hatya kar di thi, jisamen vinod ke parijan bhi the
 But on October 9 last week, the Patna High Court acquitted all 26 accused in the case
 is faisle ke baad se unki ummiden bhi dam todgaye lagi hai
 However, 35-year-old Vinod says that he will knock the door to the Supreme Court and the President for justice
 ve doshiyon ko bari hone ke liye rajya sarkaar ko jimmedaar maanate hai
 He says, "nitish Kumar's intention is not good
 unki sarkaar ne pehle kaarykaal main amir das ayog ko bhang kar diya, jise is jansanhaar main shaamil logon khaskar netaaon kaa haath hone ko jaahir karne ke liye gathit kiya gaya tha
 In the second term, the government completely ignored and we were also denied justice
 ''vinod akele aise shaks nahin hai jinhen sarkaar se sakht naaraazgi he
 Such is the suffering of 14 families in Laxmanpur Bathe of Kaler block of Arwal district, who lost their families in this massacre
 ab ye log insaaf na milane se hataash or pareshaan hai
 In this scandal, 60-year-old Lakshman Rajavanshi, who lost his wife, daughter and daughter-in-law, explodes, "such a life is like a corpse
" bharosa tha ki nyaay milegaa lekin aisa nahin hua
 The villagers are finding the police, administration, government and system all meaningless
 garibchand choudhary ke parivaar main nau logon kii maut ho gai thi
 With this decision, this family is in such a way that their son Dugnath Chaudhary does not think it is appropriate to react
 vidambnaa to yah he ki is ghatana ke aaropee bhi lakshmanpur bathe, kamta or chanda gaanv ke log hi hai
 In Laxmanpur Bathe village, situated on the banks of Son River, firecrackers are being released on one side and sweets are being distributed on one side, on the other hand people are in shock
 unka 15 saal purana jakhm phir se haraa ho gaya he
 The victims hold the government responsible for this

 Justice v of Patna High Court
 en
 Sinha and A
 ke
 Lal's bench has acquitted the accused for lack of sufficient evidence against them
 adaalat ne tippanee main kaha he ki court main kaaphi kamjor sakshya prastut kiye gaye
 No one can be hanged or imprisoned on the basis of these
 adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki isamen nishpaksh or twarit gati se sakshya nahin jutaaye gaye
 Earlier on April 7, 2010, the Additional District Judge of the Patna Civil Court, Vijay Prakash Mishra, termed the incident as Rare of the Rare and sentenced 16 accused to death and 10 were sentenced to life imprisonment
 jaj ne kaha tha ki yah ghatana dardanaak he
 The accused did not spare even the young children
 asahaay or garib varg ke logon kii hatya kii gai
 The accused did not have anything called Daya
 sajaa is tarah kii honi chahie ki bhavishya main is tarah kaa aparaadh karne se log daren
 But the reality is that the functioning of the police in the Bathe massacre case was very relaxed
 praathmiki ke mutabik ranvir sena ke kareeb 200 logon ne ise anjaam diya tha
 The police had filed a charge sheet against 46 people 11 years after the massacre
 inamen se 19 ko sakshya ke abhaav main nichali adaalat ne bari kar diya tha
 It also took a long time to hear the case
 adaalat main abhiyojan ke 117 gavaah jabaki bachaav paksh ke 152 gavaahon kii gavaahi hui
 On the order of Patna High Court, the case was transferred from Jehanabad to Patna Civil Court for trial in 1999
 bihar ke itihaas main yah sabase krur jansanhaar tha
 The dead included 27 women and 10 innocent children
 loksabhaa main tatkaaleen vipaksh ke netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi ne bhi peedit pariwaron se milakar unhen santvanaa di thi, vahiin tatkaaleen raashtrapati ke
 R
 narayanan ne ise rashtriya shame kii sangya di thi
 The then State Government formed the Amir Das Commission to investigate the incident
 lekin samay bitne ke saath hi sab kuch hawa ho gaya
 Oddly enough, this is not the first massacre for Bihar in which the accused are acquitted for lack of evidence
 iske pehle 11 july, 1996 ko bhojpur jile ke sahaar thana ke bathani tolaa, 11 november 1998 ko nagari narsanhaar or 16 june, 2000 ko miyampur narsanhaar main logon ko maut ke ghat utaarne vaale kathith taur par ranvir sena ke aropiyon ko sakshya ke abhaav main bari kiya ja chukaa he
 The government also showed no activism
 haalanki ab anusuchit jati / janajati kalyaan mantri jithan ram maanjhi kehete hai, ''sarkaar faisle ke khilaaf supreme court jaaegi
 The state's Additional Advocate General Lalit Kishore has also said that the Chief Minister has given consent to go to the Supreme Court
 is faisle ke khilaaf virodh pradarshnon kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya he
 CPI Male took out an angry march against the state government
 party ke rashtriya mahasachiv dipankar bhattacharya ne kaha, ''2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main nitish sarkaar ne jansanhaariyon ko sajaa dilaane or garibon ko nyaay dene ke naam par vot maanga tha
 Before the elections, the culprits were made to be punished by the lower court
 ab hycourt ne ek-ek kar sabhi aaropee bari kar die hai
 This is the destruction of justice
 '' unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke charitra kaa pardaafash usee vakt ho gaya tha jab usne amirdaas ayog ko bhang kiya tha
 He was about to submit his report
 baharhaal sawaal yahi he ki jab sabhi aaropee bari ho gaye to 58 daliton ko aakhir kisne maaraa? sarkaar or prashasan kii karypranali aisi hi bani rahi to unhen nyaay kahaan se milegaa jo garib, asahaay or asurakshit hai
