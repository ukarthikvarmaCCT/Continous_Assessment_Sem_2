 This scene also throws away the current status of women in patriarchal society and her thinking about society
 hindi film kaa yah nirnaayak mode he
 With the changing society, not only the thinking is changing but everything has changed, from the words of films to the background and whereabouts of the stories
 badalte daur kii kahaniyaan aam aadmi se judi hai
 Now, heroines in films are not just an object of glamor
 shahari mahilaon kaa majboot aks cinemai parade par pukhta dhang se dikhne laga he
 More than budget, stories have started getting stories and stories have become more important than film actors
 misaal ke taur par 2015 kii filmon ko liya ja saktaa he jab saal kii sabase zyada kamai karne vaali 10 filmon main se saat filmein (tanu vaids manu riterns, pyaar kaa panchnaama-2, kis kisko pyaar karun, dam laga ke haisha, piku, het story-3, badlapur, enech-10) apekshaakrit kam bajet kii thim
 According to the KPMG-FICCI Indian Media and Entertainment Industry Report-2016, "A few years ago, big films with big stars performed well at the box office, but due to the weak storyline, the big stars of 2015 were seen licking the dust
 hollywood or riginal cinema se behtareen saamagree aane kii vajah se darshakon ke paas vikalp bad rahe hai or unki pasand or pukhta ho rahi he
 "but three decades ago there was no such situation
 1986 main anil kapur, sanjay dutt or mithun chakravarti jaise yuva sitaron the to rajesh khanna, amitabh bachchan, dharmendra, jitendra or vinod khanna jaise senior actor bhi maidan main jame the
 Films like Karma, Nagina, Naam, Jambaz and Aakhri Rasta were also being released
 us samay tak single screen cinemagharon kaa daur tha or film dekhnaa kisi utsav se kam nahin tha
 Till now, films had not caught the air of marketism
 art se lekar vyavsaayik filmein ban rahi thim
 There was also a big gap between the two types of films
 lekin pichley teen dashak main yah khai ab mit chuki he
 When Shyam Benegal, who made realistic or art films like Mandi (1983) and Trikala (1985), changed his angle slightly, he made commercial films like Zubaida (2001), Welcome to Sajjanpur (2008) and Well Done Abba (2010)
 aisa hi kuch nasiruddin shah ke bare main bhi he, unhone samanaantar cinema ke alaava tridev (1989) or dedh ishkia (2014) tak lanbaa safar tay kar liya he
 He has done various characters ranging from villain to hero and colorful mood lover
 yani badlaav kii bayaar se koi achoota nahin he
 Changed the face of the industry If we look at the top 10 films of 1986, then all of them were Hero Oriented
 haalanki unamem ikkaa-dukka majboot mahila paatr maa ke role main najar aa jate the
 Nutan played a tremendous role in Karma and Naam
 nagina main shridevi badla leti najar ain
 But four of the top 10 films in 2015 were based on women
 tanu vaids manu riterns kii bebaak kangana ranot ho yaa dam laga ke haisha kii overvet bhoomi pednekar yaa apane pita ko behad pyaar karne vaali piku kii deepika padukon yaa phir enech-10 main purushavaadi soch rakhane waalon kii khabar lene vaali anoushka sharma
 The story of a girl going on a lonely honeymoon was seen in Queen, Vidya Balan screened the life of Silk Smita in Dirty Picture
 bollywood main camere ke aage or peeche mahilaon kii badhati maujuudagi ne sunishchit kiya ki behtareen kahaniyaan saamne aaen
 For example, English Vinglish can be taken
 angreji bhashaa ko lekar ek aurat kii jindagi main aane vaali samasyaon par aadhaarit is film diarector gauri scindia kaa kahana he, ''bollywood ko samaaj kaa aainaa kaha jaataa he
 But the arrival of films on women and their success does not mean that our society is becoming fully sensitive towards women
 abhi auraton ke prati samvedansheeltaa dikhaane ke liye hamaare samaaj ko kaaphi aage janaa hoga
 Whatever is going on now is just the beginning
 filmein bhi isamen apana yogadan dene kii koshish kar rahi hai
 "gauri is also right to say, but there are changes
 ek dashak pehle tak bollywood main aparnaa sen (36 chaiyrangi len), sai paranjape (chashmebaddur), tanuja chandra (tamanna, dushman or sangharsh), kalpana laazmi (rudaali), deepa mehta (fire or arth) or mira nair (salaam bombai, kamasutra or monsoon wedding) naam hi dhyaan main aate the
 But by 2016, it increased tremendously
 rima kagti (talash), joya akhtar (jindagi naa milegi dobaaraa), farh khan (om shanti om), leena yadav (pachrd), kiran raav (dhobi ghat), anushaa rizvi (pipli live), nandita das (firaaq) or ashvini ayyar tiwari (nil bate sannata) jaise naamon kii lambii qatari he
 Not only this, there are names like Juhi Chaturvedi (vicky Donor and Piku), Shagufta Rafiq (jannat-2) and Urmi Juvekar (shanghai) in the writing which are presenting the stories of modern women on screen while Munir Kausar (lyricist) and Sneha There is Khanwalkar (musician) who holds his coinage in an area dominated by men
 asal jindagi kaa badhata dakhal1980-90 kaa dashak engri yangamain or romantic kahaniyon kaa rahaa
 The hero of the film used to be larger than life
 nai sadi ko chuumate hi kahaniyaan asal jindagi kii ore teji se kadam badhaane lageen
 The number of real life characters increased
 khalanaayak kii avadharana hi badal gai
 By 2016, the face of the films had changed
 filmon se gaayab hua aam aadmi lautaa
 Villages were transformed into towns
 ardhashahari jivan cinema ke parade tak pahunch gaya
 2010 was decisive in small-town films
 dabang se shuruyaat hui or ishkia, udaan, pipli live, funs gaye re obama ne is rujhaan ko aage badhaayaa
 Then to pursue this same spirit, Tanu Weds Manu (kanpur), Ranjhana (banaras), Dum Laga Ke Haisha (haridwar), Manjhi: The Mountain Man (bihar), Gangs of Wasseypur-1
2 (wasseypur), Sultan (haryana) ) And films like Aligarh
 mjedaar yah ki chote shahar kii ye filmein bade taam-jhaam se dur thim
 The low budget of these films gave them a new formula of success
 gangs of vasepur ke riter-actor jishaan kadri maanate hai, ''har koi apni kahani dekhnaa chahta he
 Then people are fond of watching real life events
 aap kisi chote shahar yaa kasbe ko dekhen to vahaan aapako hairaan kar dene vaali kahaniyaan milengi
 "his point has also been proved
 asal jindagi kii kahaniyaan hongi to ve asal logon se judi hongi
 Till two decades ago, films talking about the common man used to come to art cinema, or films were made only on big leaders or celebrities
 jaise sardaar patel, bhagat singh or mahatma gandhi
 But now instead of the greats, the life of people filled with weaknesses also started coming on screen
 2007 main dhirubhai ambani kii jindagi par guru ai to shahrukh khan ne chak de! india main hockey khilaadi miraranjan negi ko silver screen par jinda kiya
 From here, the process of making a film on the life of special people related to sports, film and life started
 da darty pikchar (silk smita kii byopic), paan singh tomars (athlete se daaku bane paan singh), bhaag milkha bhaag (athlete milkha singh), mairi com (mahila boxr) or sarbajit (pakistan main band bhartiya shaks) jaisi filmein ain jinhone bollywood ko paripati se hatakar kuch nayaa karne ke liye prerit kiya
 The success of these films also proved that when we can take real stories from real life, why do we need a remake of Hollywood, regional cinema? Not only this, the involvement of young directors in films has also increased
 ali abbaas jafar (sultan), niraj ghevon (masaan), punit malhotra (aai het lav stories), vikramaditya motwane (udaan), abhishek sharma (tere bin laden), ayaan mukherjee (vek ap cid), mohit suri (ek villen), joya akhtar, vikaas bahal (queen) or shonali bose (maargrita vid straw) jaise nai peedi ke diarector bhi hai jinaki kahaniyaan ekadam alag hai or maujuuda samay main ekadam makul bhi
 Changed language: In the total population of India, the number of youth aged 15-24 years is 35%
 is tarah yuvaaon kii dhamak ko filmon ke har pahalu main dekha ja saktaa he
 This is seen in cinema too
 metro culture or technology ke dakhal kii vajah se yuva zyada jaagruk ho gaye hai
 Bollywood and its people have also understood this
 multiplex youth oriented approach rakhte hai to bollywood kii bhashaa ne bhi yuvaaon ke mutabik angadaai lee
 Hinglish went down to the veins in films
 1980-90 ke dashak main jahaan hindustani ke bharpoor istemaal kaa chalan tha, vah 2010 ke baad hinglish main tabdeel ho gaya
 About 50 percent of the titles of Bollywood films are in English or Hinglish, the songs are also full of English words
 gulzaar maanate hai ki cinema kii jubaan samay ke mutabik rahati he
 He says, "the kind of society is, and the way stories are the same language
" " vaise bhi bhashaa hameshaa samaaj or samay kesath badalati jaati he
 Not only this, language boundaries are now being broken
 marathi se lekar kisi bhi kshetreey bhashaa kaa cinema hamen prabhavit kar rahaa he
 In this race of modernism, cinema is connecting and defining us in a new way
 is baat ke saaf sanket de rahaa he ki ab sab kuch yuva or taaja he

 The situation is further complicated by not having the same picture in all exit polls
 kuch agsit pole main congress ko to kuch main bijepi ko aage dikhaaya gaya he
 As far as the Congress is concerned, it is not only talking about forming a government in Karnataka, but is also claiming to win 127 seats citing its internal survey
 vaise congress ne har sthiti ke liye khud ko taiyaar bhi rakhaa hua he
 The Congress wants to retain the fort of Karnataka in its entirety
 party ne iske liye teen plan taiyaar kiye hai or agar teenon main naakaam rahi to jedies ke mukhyamantri ko samarthan dene ke bajaay vipaksh main baithna pasand karegi
 Karnataka does not want to repeat the mistake of Goa and Meghalaya this time
 congress kaa plan 'a'party kaa pehla plan to bada sidhaa he ki congress ko agar bahumat miltaa he to siddharmaiya siem bane
 In this case, Siddaramaiah's statement that there is no need, he will retreat himself to make a Dalit CM from the party
 aakhir congress or party adhyaksh rahul gandhi, donon kii siem ke liye pehali pasand siddharmaiya hi hai
 Also, the party has already projected him as the face of CM
 congress kaa plan 'b'congress agar bahumat se dur rahete hue 105 ke aasapaas siton par rahati he to siddharmaiya ne aisi surat main bhi party ko bharosa diya hua he
 According to Siddaramaiah, for this, they will combine independents, non BJP and non JDS mlas
 congress kaa plan 'c'congress agar bahumat se zyada dur rahati he to har keemat par uski koshish bijepi ko satta se dur rakhane kii hogi
 The third plan is the most important for the Congress
 yani agar congress bahumat se zyaada dur rahati he to jedies se milakar sarkaar bana sakati he
 In such a case, the party will try to bring the JDS together
 lekin ye tay he ki congress mukhyamantri kii kursi jedies ko katai nahin degi
 On the other hand, the possibility of the JDS agreeing for the Chief Minister in the name of Siddaramaiah would be slim
 jedies bhuuli nahin he ki kis tarah siddharmaiya ne jedies ko todakar ateet main congress kaa haath thama tha
 In such a situation, the Congress will introduce Siddaramaiah as the CM of any party's Dalit face
 loksabhaa main rahul karenge aguwai?aisa hota he to karnataka congress adhyaksh ji
 Parmeshwar or the leader of the party in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge may be the CM candidate
 vaise party main charchaa is baat kii bhi he ki, agar badale halaat main khadge ko siem banaakar bhejnaa padaa, to rahul khud loksabhaa main party kaa netaa pad sambhaal sakate hai
 But all these are in the balance of the future
 ranneeti ke lihaaj se party ke prabharee mahasachiv ke si venugopal or prabharee sachiv madhu goud yakshi ko party ne rajya main tainaat rakhaa he
 Apart from these, the Congress high command has sent the leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and the party's general secretary Ashok Gehlot to Delhi to do the math of statistics and statistics
 party ko ashanka he ki goa or meghalaya jaisaa ghatnakram karnataka main dohraane naa paae
 In Goa and Meghalaya, the bjp's post-election management was heavily contested by the Congress and was successful in forming the government
 plan ‘C’ ke maamle par congress ke netaa khulkar kuch nahin bol rahe, lekin jedies se talmail ke sawaal par party netaa arpyen singh ne kaha ki, karnataka main hamaari sarkaar ban rahi he, phir bhi agar jedies dharmanirpeksh ekajutata ke naam par hamaare saath aati he to uskaa swaagat he
 According to sources, the Congress will try its best to stop the JDS from going with the BJP
 sutara bataate hai ki congress jedies ko ye bhi samajhaayegi ki bijepi endie main apane sahyogiyon ke saath kis tarah kaa vyavhaar karti he
 For this, the party can cite Telugu Desam of Shiv Sena and Chandrababu Naidu
 yahaan tak ki nitish kumaar kii misaal bhi congress de sakati he
 According to sources, the Congress will also tell the JDS that the BJP may break its MLA in the coming tomorrow
 duusari taraf congress 2019 ke liye bada secular dalon kaa gathjod banaayegi hi, jisame haath milaane kii surat main jedies ke liye bhi jagah hogi
 But in case of going with the BJP, the JDS will have to remain disenchanted with the BJP and its voters, because then the minority and secular votes will get away from the JDS

 In an exclusive interview with Aaj Tak, Akhilesh Yadav said that the first priority of both parties is to defeat the Narendra Modi-led BJP
 mukhyamantri awaas se ek kilometre dur lakhanu ke vikramaditya maarg sthit apane nivas sthaan par baithe akhilesh ne yogi adityanath par bhi tanj ksaa, jinhone mukhyamantri kii kursi par akhilesh kii jagah lee thi
 He said, 'the people of UP did not vote for him
 logon ne narendra modi ke naam par vot diya tha
 The Prime Minister should have given the state a good Chief Minister
 upi main kahin nyaay nahin ho rahaa
 Yogiji is mostly seen in religious activities
 ve ek achche sadhu ho sakate hai, lekin achche mukhyamantri nahin hai
 'akhilesh told how the by-election took place' alliance 'the Samajwadi Party president for the first time told the story behind the manipulation behind the alliance with the BSP in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections, saying that the party leaders wanted the alliance, as well The cadre and the voter were also in favor of a coalition of both parties
 unhone kaha, 'pehle baat back channel ke jariye hi shuru hui or phir maine mayawatiji se phone par baat kii
 Then we had dinner together at the same table during a meeting in Delhi at the invitation of the Congress, where a lot of things happened, which need not be told
 kyonki bijepi bahut hi hoshiyaar party he
 On the question of forgetting his previous bitterness with the BSP, Akhilesh said that the Samajwadi Party was founded by Mulayam Singh Yadav, but now it is a new party
 gathbandhan kii majbootee ke liye hamen apana pichhlaa itihaas bhoolanaa hoga
 Let us tell you that after the infamous guest house scandal of June 2, 1995, the relationship between SP and BSP has never been comfortable
 1993 main babari masjid vidhwans cond ke baad bijepi ko rokane ke liye kanshiram or mulaayam singh ke bich gathbandhan hua tha or donon partiyon ne upi kii satta par kabja jamaaya tha
 'BSP-SP alliance broken by Mulayam's manipulation' Although the alliance of the two parties was not smooth, Mulayam tried to weaken his ally by breaking BSP mlas
 yahaan bijepi ne hastkshep kiya or mayawati ko mukhyamantri kii kursi par bithaane main madad kii
 Since then, SP and BSP have been staunch opponents of each other in Indian politics
 haalanki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main maat khaane ke baad donon partiyon ne 2018 main gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav ke liye saath aane kaa faisla kiya
 In the by-elections, the BSP did not field any candidate and supported the SP candidate
 nateeja sapa ke paksh main rahaa or donon partiyon ne milakar bijepi ko sharmasaar kar diya
 Akhilesh himself went to thank Mayawati for the support, after the by-election results, Akhilesh himself went to Mayawati's residence to thank her, where the two leaders had an hour-long conversation
 akhilesh ne kaha, 'us baithak main hamane bhavishya kii ranneeti ke bare main charchaa kii thi
 i cannot say too much, but we discussed the need to contest elections together
 'akhilesh ne ye bhi kaha ki aane vaale vidhaan parishad ke chunaav main bhi sapa, basapa ke ummidavaar kaa samarthan karegi
 Earlier the SP had supported the BSP candidate in the Rajya Sabha elections, but the BJP candidate was successful in winning
 upachunaav kii do siton par saath chunaav ladane ke mukaable loksabhaa chunaav main aapasi sahmati zyada mushkil hogi or ise 2022 ke vidhansabha chunaav main amalijama pehanaane zyada mushkil hoga, kyonki donon netaa tab mukhyamantri kii kursi ke lard rahe honge
 In response to this question, Akhilesh said that the assembly election is still far away
 hamaari pehali praathamikta abhi loksabhaa chunaav he
 Akhilesh also said that Netaji Mulayam Singh Yadav has given his blessings to the alliance of SP and BSP
 'congress ke saath dosti, gathbandhan par faisla baad main'congress ke saath upi main bijepi ke khilaaf sabhi partiyon ko saath lene ke sawaal par akhilesh ne kaha ki congress ke saath hamaari dosti jari rahegi, lekin gathbandhan par aage chalakar baat hogi
 He said that Congress has no support in both the seats of Lok Sabha by-elections, but they fielded candidates in both seats without any discussion
 gujarat or ab karnataka main rahul gandhi ke mandir daure par akhilesh ne kaha ki mere ghar main mandir he
 My wife worships everyday
 chunaavon se pehle koi kahin bhi ja saktaa he
 But nothing should be done at the time of elections which leads to deviation of people from political issues
 2019 main congress kii bhoomika ke bare main sanket dete hue akhilesh ne kaha ki tiemasi or tidipi jaisi partiyaan jis samjhaute ke liye koshish kar rahi hai, use hamaara samarthan he
 But for an effective alliance it is necessary that in states where regional parties are strong, other parties (eg Congress) should support them
 'unnav cese main kadi karrwai karen mukhyamantri'unnav rape cese par pratikriya dete hue akhilesh ne kaha ki yah ek dukhad ghatana he
 The victim is accusing the MLA and the government and police are trying to protect her
 mukhyamantri ko is par kadaa ection lenaa chahie, lekin jis tarah kii sahanubhuti vidhayak ke prati dijipi kii ore se dikhaai gai he, wo peedita ke saath hue anyaay kaa sanket detaa he

 'bigg Boss' is synonymous with controversies
 lekin beshak chaahe ladaai jitani bhi rahe or jitna bhi ho-hallaa hota rahe, ghar main hinsa ko bardaasht nahin kiya jaataa he
 This fact is evident from the fact that Ejaz Khan, who came as a challenger in 'bigg Boss Halla Bol', has been thrown out due to violence with Ali Quli Mirza
 aaj ali or ejajake bich main majaak main shuru hui baatcheet hinsa kaa rup akhriyaar kar legi

 'pundir says that the registration form is being given free of cost to the unemployed
 yah form ek lipaphe ke aakaar kaa he
 According to the points given on the envelope, the unemployed fill their information and then submit a certified copy of their educational certificates in the envelope
 in praaanpatron ke hisaab se berozegaron ko unki yogyata ke hisaab se vargeekrut kar liya jaataa he or iske anusaar inhen uplabdh naukari kii jaankaree muhaiyaa kara di jaati he
 After the election, if the government asks for information about the unemployed, it will also be provided

 But this time in February, more than 1,25,000 registrations have been done
 azamgarh, mau or baliya jile main bhi sevaayojan karyaalay ke adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ke paas saans lene kii fursat nahin he

 The story of 'bharat' is from Salman Khan
 film kii kahani desh ke vibhaajan se shuru hoti he
 India gets separated from her father
 lekin use jimmedaari milti he apane parivaar kii dekh-rekh kii
 In which he completes at all costs
 bharat apane parivaar kii khatir sarkas main jokhim uthaata he, vahaan use disha pataani bhi milti he lekin apni jimmedaariyon ke chalate vah vahaan se aage bad jaataa he
 Then moves on in life and works in an oil exploration company
 phir uski mulaakaat katrina caff se hoti he, lekin bharat yahaan bhi parivaar ko variyata detaa he or jindagi main aage badhata jaataa he
 But Katrina lives with him
 is saare safar main uskaa dost sunil grover uske saath rahata he
 While the first half of the film is associated with the struggles and light moments of India, the second part becomes quite emotional
 yahaan film thodi khinchi hui lagati he
 But the film's collage is too big, so the director can get into this kind of trouble
 lekin gane tang karte hai or editing main kasaavat thodi or hoti to majaa aa jaataa
 On the acting front, in 'bharat', where Salman Khan laughs and tickles, he also does emotional
 phir bhaijan ke phans ko salmaan khan umr ke kai padaav main najar aaenge, lekin unke sharir kii kasaavat kahin kam hone vaali nahin
 The special thing about 'bharat' is that Salman Khan accumulates even more when he is old
 is tarah kaa shandaar budhapa koun nahin chahega
 Katrina Kaif has definitely surprised with her acting in the film
 katrina caff kaa kirdaar dil main utar jaataa he or vah is role main bahut hi behtareen bhi lagi hai
 Sunil Grover is a good actor with a comedian, and he has proved this well in India
 film ke baaki sabhi actor thik-thaak hai
 The 'slow motion' song of Salman Khan's 'bharat' (bharat) is remembered
 film dekhne ke baad salmaan khan disha pataani kii is song main chemistry kaaphi der tak jehan main chai rahati he
 The rest of the film's songs are a bit cramped and stunt the flow of the film
 ali abbaas jafar salmaan khan ke saath rang jamaa jate hai
 There is no doubt this time also
 kahani or editing main gunjaaish rah jaati he
 But Bhaijaan's film Thahari, then one of his dialogues must be kept in mind while watching his film, 'I come to heart, i don't understand

 bollywood abhinayta sani deol apane bete karan deol ko bollywood main launch karne kii taiyaari main hai
 For Karan's acting debut, Sunny is looking for a good story and a good director
 khabaron ke anusaar, sani bollywood ke kai nami nirdeshkon se baatcheet bhi kar rahe hai
 The idea of launching Sunny's son Karan into Bollywood was around 2010
 iske liye karan ko acting kii shiksha di gai tathaa unhen assistant diarection main bhi kaam karne ko kaha gaya
 Karan is still working with his father Sunny Deol as Assistant Director in the sequel 'ghayal Returns' of the film 'ghayal'
 bich main khabaren ai thim ki film 'gadar' ke nirdeshak anil sharma ke nirdesan main karan deol ko launch kiya jayega magar koi acchhee kahani na milane kii vajah se deol parivaar se anil sharma ko ab tak ijazat nahin mili
 So Sunny himself went out in search of a director
 khabaron ke mutabik, sani ne nirdeshak rakesh om prakaash mehara se mulaakaat kii thi, magar rakesh abhi anil kapur ke bete harshavardhan kapur kii pehali film banane main vyast hai
 After the success of the film 'queen', its director Vikas Bahl is also in the headlines, so Sunny also approached Vikas
 vikaas bhi apni aane vaali do filmon main vyast hai isliye sani ko vikaas se bhi abhi samay nahin mila he
 It is also reported that Sunny has also talked to Imtiaz Ali to launch her son Karan, who was given the first opportunity as a director by Dharmendra in the film 'socha Na Tha' and from this film Sunny's cousin Abhay Deol Had made her acting debut

 ’’media main ai khabaron ke mutabik kumaraswami ne party vidhayakon kii haalia baithak main unase kaha tha ki vah dabaav main kaam kar rahe hai

 Employees are continuing their efforts to revive Jet Airways on the verge of closure
 darasal, airline ke karmchaariyon ne aane vaale dinon main 7,000 karod rupee kaa fund jutaney kaa daawa kiya he
 The group of employees wrote to SBI (state Bank of India) seeking permission to bid for the management control of the company to the union of employees and external investors
 bataa den ki vartmaan main jet airways kaa control esbiai kii aguwai main bainkon ke samooh ke paas he
 The Society for Welfare of Indian Pilots (SWIP) and Jet Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Welfare Association (JAMEVA), representing the airline's pilots-engineers, has written to SBI Chairman Rajneesh Kumar proposing to take over the airline's operations
 in unionon kaa kahana he ki ve airline ke parichaalan ke liye 7,000 karod rupee kaa prabandh kar sakati hai
 SWIP has a membership of 800, while JAMEVA has a membership of 500
 yah pehla mauka he jab karmchaaree 25 saal puraani airline kaa parichaalan karne kaa prastaav lekar aae hai
 But the question is how will the employees arrange Rs 7 thousand crore
 is par patr main union ne bataaya he ki hamaare shuruaati anumaan ke anusaar paanch saal ke karmchaaree share swaamitv kaarykram (isop) se aamadani 4,000 karod rupee rahegi
 Apart from this, investment of around Rs 3,000 crore can also be raised from outside investors
 8500 karod kaa karjabata den ki jet airways ke karjadaataaon dwaara immergency fund uplabdh karaaye jane ko lekar haath khadey karne ke baad airline ne 17 april se asthaayee taur par sevaaon ko band kar diya tha
 Currently the airline is in debt of over Rs 8,500 crore
 is vajah se jet airways ke payalton sahit anya karmchaariyon ko kai maheenon se selary nahin rahi he
 The company has about 22,000 employees
 inamen kareeb 16,000 karmchaaree company ke perol par hai or 6 hajaar anubandh par hai
 However for Jet Airways employees kai aise couples hote hai jo kehete hai ki shaadi ke baad se unka rishta bighad gaya varanaa pehle to unke bich khub pyaar or acchhee anderstanding thi
 But those who say so may have tried to find out the reason for it
 kai baar aisa hota he ki aapasi anban kii vajah bahut choti hoti he lekin us par dhyaan nahin diya jaataa or vah badi hoti jaati he

 guuruuvaar ko bijepi netaa ram madhav ne kaha ki pradhanmantri nawaz sharif to hijbul mujahiddeen ke supreme commander kii tarah baat kar rahe hai
 Pakistan PM was in the worst incarnation in the United Nations, he was talking like the Supreme Commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, not like the head of Pakistan
 
 He was openly supportive of a terrorist commander, Burhan Wani
 jammu kashmir main bijepi kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale ram madhav ne kaha ki puraa desh sharif ke bhaashan se naaraaz he jisamen unhone kashmir main haalia hue pradarshnon ke masale ko bhi uchhaala
 Meanwhile, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said that 'nawaz Sharif is going to disappoint
 vah shaks jisane piem kaa apane janmdin par swaagat kiya tha, ab vah burhan vaani kii tarif kar rahaa he
 'tharoor said that this proves that we should not spend time talking to these Mahashiya (pak PM)
 hamen pakistan ke prati anya pahaluon par gaur farmana chahie
 The comments vahiin bharat ke videsh rajyamantri emje akbar ne kaha ki vah 'uri hamale main pakistan kii bhoomika' ko puri tarah se nakaarne main tule hai or aatanki burhan vaani kaa mahimamandan aatankwaad se pakistan ke judaav ko darshata he
 It is shameful to call Burhan Wani a leader and India is shocked by the praise of the terrorist
 akbar ne kaha 'hamane ek aatankwaadi kaa mahimamandan suna
 Wani was the declared commander of the Hizbul, known as a terrorist group
 yah hairaan karne vaali baat he ki ek raashtra kaa netaa swa prachaarit aatankwaadi kaa is tarah ke manch par mahimamandan kar saktaa he
 This is a self accusation by the Pakistani Prime Minister
 ' At the same time, on the claim of Nawaz Sharif of continuous efforts for talks by taking additional steps by Pakistan, Akbar said, "we have not only shown the first step, then where is the question of additional step?" He also said that Pakistan wants to hold talks 'with a gun in one hand'
 vaarta or hinsa donon saath-saath nahin chal sakate

 At the same time, India's Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar said that he is completely denying the 'role of Pakistan in the Uri attack' and the glorification of terrorist Burhan Wani reflects Pakistan's involvement with terrorism
 burhan vaani ko netaa bataanaa sharmnaak he or aatanki kii tarif se bharat hairaan he
 Akbar said, 'we heard the glorification of a terrorist
 vaani hijbul kaa ghoshit commander tha, jise aatanki samooh ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 It is surprising that the leader of a nation can glorify a self-propagating terrorist on such a platform
 yah pakistani pradhanmantri dwaara aatm doshaaropan he
 ' vahiin pakistan dwaara atirikt kadam uthaate hue baatcheet ke liye lagaataar koshishon ke navaj sharif ke daawey par akbar ne kaha, 'hamen pehla kadam hi nahin dikhaa, phir atirikt kadam kaa sawaal kahaan aata he?' unhone saath hi kaha ki pakistan 'apane ek haath main bandook thamkar' baatcheet karnaa chahta he
 Both dialogue and violence cannot go hand in hand
