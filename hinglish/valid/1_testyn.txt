 The movie of the past is a sketch by Mahadevi Varma
 isamen lekhika hamaara parichay rama, bhabhi, binda, sabia, bitto, balika maan, ghisa, abhaagi stri, alopi, bablu tathaa alopa in gyaarah charitron se karwaati hai
 He has taken all the sketches from his life itself, which is why the various incidents of his own life and various aspects of the character have been implanted spontaneously
 unhone anubhoot satyon ko jas-kaa-tas ankit kiya he
 It is also a feature of Mahadevi's sketches that the element of characterization has been prominent in them and the story is only a part of it
 inamen gambhir lok darshan kaa udghaatan hota chalata he, jo hamaare jivan kii saanskrithik dhara kii ore ingit karata he
 The 'chal-chitra of the past' includes the lavish service of the servant 'rama', the patroness and tolerance of the dissident 'sabia', the unabashed devotion to 'ghisa', the simple personality of the blind 'alopi' who sells greens, the potter 'badlu' The simple romantic love of 'radhia' and the unmatched love of Mahadevi for 'lachhama', the mountain's delight, all of these episodes show the great potential of depicting Mahadevi

 Sharon, also known as Kairn, is the largest satellite of the dwarf planet Yama
 isaki khoj 1978 main hui thi
 In 2015, the US government plans to send an unmanned spacecraft named "new Horazenz" to study Pluto and Sharon
 shairan golakaar he or uskaa vyas 1,207 kimi he, jo pluto ke vyas ke aadhe se thodaa adhik he
 Its total surface area is about 45
8 lakh square kilometers
 jahaan pluto kii sataha par nitrogen or methane kii jami gui barf he vahaan shairan par uski bajaae pani kii barf he
 Pluto has a thin atmosphere but the study of Sharon has indicated that it has no atmosphere and only a space of open space above its surface
 shairan par pluto kii tulana main pathar kam hai or barf adhik he
 Sharon is spelled "charon" in English
 khagolashastriyon main aapas main matbhed he ke shairan ke andar barf or pathar kii alag tahen hai yaa puure upgrah main ek jaisaa barf or pathar kaa mishran he
 The density of Pluto and Sharon is estimated by seeing that 70% of the mass of Pluto is stone while only 50–55% of Sharon is stone
 is se kuch vaigyanikon kii soch he ke pluto par kisi anya vastu ke jabardast takaraav se uskaa upar kaa malba udakar ek upgrah ke rup main ikaitha ho gaya
 Therefore Plato has more snow in the upper surface of Sharon and less stones inside Pluto
 lekin is vichaar main ek shankaa paidaa hoti he - agar vastav main aisa hua hota to shairan kaa or bhi bada pratishat hissaa barf kaa bana hona chahie or pluto kaa or bhi bada pratishat hissaa pathar kaa
 Therefore some other scientists believe that Sharon and Pluto were separate objects from the beginning which collided, but then separated and started to revolve around each other
 pluto or shairan kaa mail saura mandal main anokhaa he
 Sharon has more than half the diameter of Pluto and 11
6% of its mass - the largest of any satellite-planet pair in the solar system
 tulana ke liye prithvi ke chandramaa kaa vyas prithvi kaa lagbhag ek-chauthai or dravyaman prithvi kaa keval 1
2% he
 For this reason, the mixed mass center point of Pluto and Sharon lies not in the open space between Pluto but both Pluto and Sharon revolve around this point
 agar khagolashastra kii paribhaashaayen sakhti se lagaai jaaen to aisi sthiti main do khagoleey vastuon ko grah-upgrah na kahkar judwaan grah kaha jaataa he
 Yet Sharon is generally considered to be the satellite of Pluto

 They reached the mountains near the Himalayas in 1830, but Nepal was reluctant to let the British enter the country because Nepal feared political and possible invasion

 The British were forced to continue observation from the Terai, an area south of Nepal that is parallel to the Himalayas

 Nevertheless, in 1847, the British were compelled and began to observe in detail the Himalayan peaks from the observation station to 240 km
 mausam ne saal ke ant main kaam ko teen mahine tak roke rakhaa
 In November 1847, the British Surveyor General Andrew Waugh of India made a number of observations from the Sawaipur station which is situated at the eastern end of the Himalayas
 us samay kanchanajangha ko vishwa ki sabase unchi chotii maani gai or usne ruchipurvak note kiya ki, is ke peeche bhi lagbhag 230 kimi dur ek chotii he

 vaug ne baad main likhaa ki avlokan darshata he ki chotii ‘bi’ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha, lekin avlokan bahut dur se hua tha, satyaapan ke liye najadik se avlokan karnaa jaruri he
 In the coming year, Vogue sent a survey officer to observe peak 'B' in the Terai from the viewpoint, but the clouds stopped all efforts

 Nicholson produced two observations from Girol 190 km away

 The number was clearly shown, although that peak was higher than 'B' Kanchenjunga
 yadhyapi, nicholson ko malaria ho gaya or use ghar laut jane ke liye vivash kiya gaya, hisaab-kitaab khatm nahin ho paaya
 Michael Hennessy, a subsidiary of Vogue, began assigning peaks based on Roman numbers, gave Kanchenjunga the IX name, and Choti 'B' the name XV

 Vogue started work on Nicholas' data in 1854 and worked with his staff for nearly two years at vast distances over the years of calculations, transactions of light refraction, air pressure, observation
 san 1856 ke march main usne patr ke madhyam se kalakatta main apane pratinidhi ko apni khoj kaa puri tarah se udghosh kar diya
 The height of Kanchenjunga was clearly stated to be 28,156 feet, while the height of XV was stated

 They die all over the world every day
 shaareerik maut mrityu ek baar kii sthiti: prakriya ab prativarti main dekha jaataa he
 Where a dividing line in the process of death and life is drawn, the normal clinical death depends on the absence of significant symptoms between death and is not sufficient for a necessary legal determination
 dil or fefdon kii ek marij ke saath kaam karne ke liye ghatanevaala mrityu nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he mrit mastishk ke bina kanoonee taur par mrit ghoshit hota he sateek paribhaasha kii maut chikitsa, duusare shabdon main or adhik vidambnaa agrim ke rup main vaigyanik gyaan or dawaai
samasyagrast ho jaati he
 Signs of death or strong signs that a person is still alive: maut kii avadharana kii kunjee ghatana he vahaan kii avadharana ke liye kai vaigyanik tareeke hai
 For example, brain death, in medical practice as science, defines death as a point in time during which brain activity remains
 This is a distinction from a life of defining challenges in a death
 samay main ek bindu ke rup main, mrityu ke kshan, jis par jivan samaapt hota he kaa ullekh karne ke prathit hota he
 However, when determining death has occurred, precise drawing of conceptual boundaries between life and death is required
 is samasyagrast he kyonki vahaan kaise jivan ko paribhaashit karne se adhik chote aam sahmati he
 It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness
 When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died
 One of the notable flaws in this approach, however, is that there are many organisms that are alive but perhaps not conscious for example, the single-celled organism is another problem with this approach to consciousness, which many different modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers have The definition given by is used in defining
 maut ko paribhaashit karne kii yah aam samasya chikitsa ke sandarbh main paribhaashit kii maut khaas chunauti dene ke liye lagu hota he
 Other definitions for death focus on the character of some disturbance
 In this context, "death" is simply the state where something is left, eg, life describes
 is prakaar, "jivan kii paribhaasha ek saath maut paribhaashit karata he
 Historically, attempts to define the moment of death of a human have been problematic
 or giraftaar ek baar paribhaashit ke rup main band ke dil hriday haraaya he, lekin seepiaar kaa vikaas or sheeghra defibrillation aparyaapt paribhaasha he pradaan kii he ki kyonki shwaas or dil kii dhadkan ko punah aarambh kiya ja saktaa he kabhi kabhi

 yah mana jaataa he ki vidyut gatividhi kaa ek ant chetana ant kaa sanket bhi he
 However, the suspension of consciousness should be permanent and not transient, as something happens during sleep stages and especially coma
 In case of gold, Anda can easily tell the difference haalanki, shrenee "mastishk mrityu" kuch vidwaanon dwaara dekha jaataa he ke liye samasyagrast ho

 However, at present, the conservative definition of most deaths in places of electrically irreversible termination in whole brain activity as opposed to the neo-cortex has been adopted in the Uniform United States Act for example
 , Terri Schiavo case brought to the question the american politics of livelihood and artificial brain death puure dimag maapdand, mastishk mrityu kaa sankalp dwaara bhi jatil ho saktaa he
 The Eagles base could detect simulated impulses, while some drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or hypothermia can prevent or temporarily suppress brain activity by suppressing the brain's brain
 Because of this, hospital defined conditions include widely varying intervals
 Eigs is the protocol for determining death

 The right to resume brain activity is the ability of brain activity, or, 0} required in the United States

 Once Parvati ji asked Lord Shiva Shankar, 'what is the best and simple fast-worship, from which the beings of the dead land get your grace easily?' In reply, Shivji told this story by telling Parvati to observe the fast of 'shivratri' - 'once there was a hunter named Chitrabhanu
 pashuon kii hatya karke vah apane kutumb ko paalataa tha
 He was indebted to a moneylender, but could not repay his loan on time

 You will kill two creatures simultaneously, which is not right
 main bachche ko janm dekar sheeghra hi tumhaare samaksh prastut ho jaaoongi, tab maar lenaa
 The hunter loosened the cross and the deer disappeared into the wild bushes

 The hunter was over the moon

 Seeing him, the deer politely pleaded, 'O Pardhi! i retired from the season a while ago

 i am wandering in search of my beloved main apane pati se milakar sheeghra hi tumhaare paas aa jaaoongi
 ' The hunter let him go as well
 do baar shikaar ko khokar uskaa maathaa thanka
 He was in all sort of thoughts
 raatri kaa aakhri pahar biit rahaa tha
 Then another antelope escaped with her children
 shikari ke liye yah svarnim avasar tha
 He did not take long to shoot arrows at the bow
 vah tir chhodane hi vaala tha ki mrigi boli, 'he pardhi!' main in bacchon ko inke pita ke hawaale karke laut aauungi
 Do not kill me this time
 shikari hansaa or bolaa, saamne aae shikaar ko chhod duun, main aisa murkh nahin
 i have lost my prey twice before
 mere bachche bhukh-pyaas se tadap rahe honge
 In response, the deer again said, as you are maltreating your children, just like me too
 isliye sirf bacchon ke naam par main thodi der ke liye jeevandaan maang rahi hum
 Hey Pardhi! Trust me, i promise to leave them to their father and return immediately
 mrigi kaa deen swar sunakar shikari ko us par dayaa aa gai
 He let that chicken escape too
 shikaar ke abhaav main bel-vrikshapar baitha shikari belptr tod-todakar neeche phenkata ja rahaa tha
 When the dawn broke, a strong deer came on the same path
 shikari ne soch liya ki iskaa shikaar vah avashya karegaa
 Seeing the trunk of the hunter, he said in a loud voice, o brother! If you have killed three antelopes and small children coming before me, do not delay in killing me, so that i do not have to suffer even a single moment in their disconnection
 main un mrigiyon kaa pati hum
 If you have given them life, please give me some life too
 main unase milakar tumhaare samaksh upasthit ho jaaoongaa
 As soon as he heard the deer, the whole night cycle happened in front of the hunter, he narrated the whole story to the deer
 tab mrug ne kaha, 'meri teenon patniyaan jis prakaar pratigyabaddh hokar gai hai, meri mrityu se apane dharm kaa paalan nahin kar paaengi
 So, just as you have left him as a confidant, let me also go
 main un sabake saath tumhaare saamne sheeghra hi upasthit hota hum
 'fasting, night-awakening and climbing the bell leaf on the Shivling, the violent heart of the hunter was purged
 usamen bhagavad shakti kaa vaas ho gaya tha
 The bow and arrow were easily left from his hand
 bhagwaan shiv kii anukanpa se uskaa hinsak hriday kaarunik bhaavon se bhar gaya
 He started burning in the flame of repentance remembering his past deeds
