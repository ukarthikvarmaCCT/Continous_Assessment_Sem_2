 veena bharat ke lokapriy vaadyayantra main se ek he jiskaa prayog praaia: shastreey sangeet main kiya jaataa he
 Veena Sur is the oldest instrument used in Indian music for sounds
 samay ke saath iske kai prakaar viksit hue hai 
 But its oldest form is the one-sided veena
 kuch log kehete hai madhyakaal main janaab amir khusro dahalavi ne sitar kii rachana veena or banjo ko milakar kiya, kuch ise guitar kaa bhi rup bataate hai
 There are many opinions about its history, but in his book Indian musical instrument, famous bizarre Veena player Dr
 Lalmani Mishra proved it to be an evolved form of the ancient Tritantri Veena
 sitar purna bhartiya vaadya he kyonki isamen bhartiya vaadyon kii teenon visheshtaayen hai
 Veena is actually the structural name of stringed instruments
 tantri yaa taron ke alaava isamen ghudch, tarab ke taar tathaa sarikas hoti hai
 Generally, it consists of four wires and there is no division of the length of the wires
 is kaaran veena pracheen sangeet ke liye zyada upyukt he
 The vibrations of the strings in the veena are faster than a spherical pitcher and the "harmonic" sound is produced by the mixing of several frequency sounds
 suravaadya hone ke liye aisi dhvaniyaan aavashyak hai
 Influenced by the strange veena, many artists have tried to reduce its size, but it also changes the gravity of the sound

 thorium eendhan chakra ek nabhikeey eendhan chakra he jo thorium ke samasthanik Th-232 kaa upyog urvar padaarth ke rup main karata he
 In the reactor, Th-232 is converted to uranium-233, a nuclear fuel
 thorium bhigi hui lakdi ke samaan he
 In order to burn wet wood first one has to dry in the furnace, similarly thorium has to be converted into fissile uranium
 " In the thorium cycle, fuel is formed when mold: simplenuclide2 captures a neutron to become mold: simplenuclide2
 This normally emits an electron and an anti-neutrino by β− decay to become mold: simplenuclide2
 This then emits another electron and anti-neutrino by a second β− decay to become mold: simplenuclide2, the fuel: Nuclear fission produces radioactive fission products which can have half-lives from days to greater than 200,000 years
 According to some toxicity studies, the thorium cycle can fully recycle actinide wastes and only emit fission product wastes, and after a few hundred years, the waste from a thorium reactor can be less toxic than the uranium ore that would have been used to produce low enriched uranium fuel for a light water reactor of the same power
other studies assume some actinide losses and find that actinide wastes dominate thorium cycle waste radioactivity at some future periods
 In a reactor, when a neutron hits a fissile atom, it either splits the nucleus or is captured and transmutes the atom
 In the case of mold: simplenuclide2, the transmutations tend to produce useful nuclear fuels rather than transuranic wastes
 When mold: simplenuclide2 absorbs a neutron, it either fissions or becomes mold: simplenuclide2
 The chance of fissioning on absorption of a thermal neutron is about 92%; the capture-to-fission ratio of template: simplenuclide2, therefore, is about 1:12 - which is better than the corresponding capture vs
 fission ratios of mold: simplenuclide2, or mold: simplenuclide2 or mold: simplenuclide2
 The result is less transuranic waste than in a reactor using the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle
 neutrons, is not fissile, but neutron capture produces fissile template: simplenuclide2
 If the fissile isotope fails to fission on neutron capture, it produces mold: simplenuclide2, template: simplenuclide2, and eventually fissile mold: simplenuclide2 and heavier isotopes of plutonium
 and transmuted to plutonium, where more of it fissions, while the remainder becomes mold: simplenuclide2, then americium and curium, which in turn can be removed as waste or returned to reactors for further transmutation and fission
 However, the saanchaa:simplenuclide2 formed via reactions with saanchaa:simplenuclide2, while not a transuranic waste, is a major contributor to the long-term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel
 Uranium-232 is also formed in this process, via reactions between fast neutrons and mold: simplenuclide2, mold: simplenuclide2, and mold: simplenuclide2: Uranium-232 has a relatively short half-life, and some decay products emit high energy gamma radiation, such as saanchaa:simplenuclide2, saanchaa:simplenuclide2 and particularly saanchaa:simplenuclide2
 The full decay chain, along with half-lives and relevant gamma energies, is: Template: simplenuclide2 decays to Template: simplenuclide2 where it joins the] Thorium-cycle fuels produce hard gamma emissions, which damage electronics, limiting their use in military bomb triggers
 saanchaa:simplenuclide2 cannot be chemically separated from saanchaa:simplenuclide2 from used nuclear fuel; however, chemical separation of thorium from uranium removes the decay product saanchaa:simplenuclide2 and the radiation from the rest of the decay chain, which gradually build up as saanchaa:simplenuclide2 reaccumulates
 The hard gamma emissions also create a radiological hazard which requires remote handling during reprocessing

 govardhan puja ke sambandh main ek lokgatha prachlit he
 The story is that Devraj Indra was proud
 indra kaa abhimaan chur karne hetu bhagwaan shri krishna jo swayan liladhari shri hari vishnu ke avatar hai ne ek lila rachi
 It was like this in the Lord's Leela that one day he saw that all the Brijwasis are making excellent dishes and preparing for some worship
 shri krishna ne bade bholepan se maiya yashoda se prashn kiya " maiya ye aap log kinaki puja kii taiyaari kar rahe hai" krishna kii baaten sunakar maiyaa boli lallaa ham devraj indra kii puja ke liye annakut kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 On the saying of Maiya, Shri Krishna said, "why do we worship Indra?" Maia said that he rains, which produces food, our cows get fodder from them
 bhagwaan shri krishna bole hamen to gorvadhan parvat kii puja kerani chahie kyonki hamaari gaaye vahiin charati hai, is drushti se gorvadhan parvat hi poojaneey he or indra to kabhi darshan bhi nahin dete va puja na karne par krodhit bhi hote hai at: aise ahamkaari kii puja nahin kerani chahie
 All of Leeladhari's Leela and Maya worshiped Govarnaghan mountain instead of Indra
 devraj indra ne ise apana apmaan samajha or musaladhar varsha shuru kar di
 Seeing the rains like the holocaust, all the Brajwasis started cursing Lord Krishna, saying that all of them have done it
 tab muralidhar ne murali qamar main daali or apni kanishtha ungali par puraa goverghan parvat uthaa liya or sabhi brijvaasiyon ko usamen apane gaay or bachhde samet sharan lene ke liye bulaayaa
 Seeing this Leela of Indra Krishna and became angry, the rain became more intense
 indra kaa maan mardan ke liye tab shri krishna ne sudarshan chakra se kaha ki aap parvat ke upar rahakar varsha kii gati ko niyatrit karen or sheshnag se kaha aap med banaakar pani ko parvat kii ore aane se roke
 Indra kept torrential rains for seven consecutive days when he realized that there could be no ordinary person to compete with him, so he reached Brahma Ji and narrated all the accounts
 brahma ji ne indra se kaha ki aap jis krishna kii baat kar rahe hai vah bhagwaan vishnu ke saakshaat ansh hai or purna purushottam narayan hai
 Hearing this from the mouth of Brahma, Indra was extremely ashamed and said to Shri Krishna that Lord i could not recognize you, so i sat erratically
 aap dayaalu hai or krupaalu bhi isliye meri bhul kshamaa karen
 After this, Devraj Indra worshiped Muralidhar and offered it to him
 is puranic ghatana ke baad se hi goverghan puja kii jane lagi
 Brijwasis worship Govarghan mountain on this day

 leonardo da vinci italivasi, mahaan chitrakaar, murtikar, vaastushilpi, sangitajna, kushal yantric, ejeeniyar tathaa vaigyanik tha
 Leonardo da Vinci was born in a village called Vinci in Florence, Italy

 Leonardo began pursuing diverse subjects from an early age, but music, painting and sculpture were predominant among them

 While living here, he completed two great works of art, an equestrian statue of Ludovico's father and a portrait titled "last Vyalu"
 ludovico ke patan ke pashchaat, san 1499 main, leanardo milin chhodkar florence waapas aa gaye, jahaan inhone anya kritiyon ke sivaay mona lisa sheershak chitra taiyaar kiya
 This picture and the picture called "last Vayalu" are considered his greatest creations

 After his stay in Rome from 1513 to 1516, the French king, Francis I, took him to his country and arranged for him to stay in the coat of Ambaz
 yaheen inaki mrityu hui
 The difference between Leonardo and other European Renaissance artists is that Vinci did not spend time primarily copying artifacts of ancient times
 ve swabhaavat: prakruti ke anany adhyeta the
 In his paintings of life, along with the subtle reality of expressive representations, such a combination of live motion and flow of lines is found as is not found in any earlier painter
 ye pehle chitrakaar the, jinhone is baat kaa anubhav kiya ki sansar ke drishyon main prakaash or chaaya kaa vilaas hi sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee tathaa sundar hota he
 So they gave it proper importance along with color and lines

 They were engaged in the exploration of esoteric rules and causes

 It is not possible to estimate the value of his current paintings in money

 There is a similar view in relation to some other idols, but certainly nothing can be said

 Many scholars believe that this script originated from the ancient Saraswati script, so it was already in use in India in the previous form
 saraswati lipi ke prachlan se hat jane ke baad praakrit bhashaa likhane ke liye brahmi lipi prachlan me ai
 There is not much written in Sanskrit in Brahmi script that can withstand the times
 praakrit / paali bhashaa me likhe gayi maury samraat ashok ke buddha upadesh aaj bhi surakshit he
 That is why the confusion perhaps developed by the Mauryans
 yah lipi usee prakaar baani ore se dahini ore ko likhi jaati thi jaise, unase nikali hui aajkal kii lipiyaan
 The names of scripts have been named in Lalitavistar, 'brahmalipi' has also got its name

 In the ancient Buddhist text 'lalitavistar', the names of the 64 scripts that were taught to the Buddha are not named 'nagari script', 'brahmi script'

 The oldest script found in India is that of Ashoka, except in the territories across the Sindh river, it is found in India in the same form everywhere
 jis lipi main ashok ke lekh hai vah pracheen aaryo yaa brahmanon kii nikaali hui brahmi lipi he
 It is written in the 'prajnapanasutra' of the Jains that the script in which the language 'ardhamagadhi' is published is Brahmi script '
 ardhamagadhi bhashaa mathura or patliputra ke bich ke pradesh kii bhashaa he jisase hindi nikali he
 Therefore, the Brahmi script is the script of Middle Aryavarta, which progressively developed the script which was called 'nagari' behind

 Some blast furnaces use a "double bell" system where two "bells" are used to control the entry of raw materials into the blast furnace
 in donon belon kaa uddeshy blast fernes main garm gaison ke nuksaan ko kam karnaa he
 The raw material is first emptied into the upper or smaller bell
 uske baad adhik sahi dhang se charge kaa vitaran karne ke liye bel ko ek purv nirdhaarit pariman main ghumaya jaataa he
 The smaller bell is then opened to empty the charge in the larger bell
 uske baad blast fernes ko band karne ke liye chote bel ko band kar diya jaataa he jabaki bada bel blast fernes main charge ko vitarit karata he
 a more recent design uses a "bellless" system

 Although the efficiency of blast furnaces is continuously developing, but still there is no change in the chemical process inside the blast furnace
 american aayran and steel institute ke anusaar: "sahasrabdi tak blast bhattiyon kaa vajood rahegaa kyonki badi or kaarykushal bhattiyon main anya louh nirmaan praudyogikiyon kii tulana main kam kharch par garm dhaatu kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 "one of the biggest drawbacks of blast furnaces is that they essentially produce carbon dioxide because carbon is converted to iron to obtain iron and there is no economical alternative - in the steelmaking world Carbon dioxide is one of the inevitable industrial contributors to emissions
 blast bhatti ke greenhouse gas utsarjan dwaara sthapit chunauti ko uelsioes ek chaalu europea kaaryam main sambodhit kiya ja rahaa he
 Several new process routes have been proposed and closely examined to cut specific emissions by at least 50%

 In the Geetgovind poetry, Jayadev mentions Jagdish as Jagannath, Dashavatari, Hari, Murari, Madhuripu, Keshav, Madhav, Krishna, etc
 yah 24 prabandh tathaa 72 shlokon yukt paripurna granth he jisamen radha-krishna ke milan-virah tathaa punarmilan ko komal tathaa laalityapurna padon dwaara bandha gaya he
 But the 13th canto of Geetgovind is also available in the 'handwritten Sanskrit Text List, part-i' published by Nagari Pracharini Sabha
 parantu yah maatrakaa arvachin prathit hoti he
 Geetgovind is highly revered in the Vaishnava sect
 atah 13veen shatabdi ke madhya se hi shri jagannatha mandir main ise nity seva ke rup main angikaar kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In every arrangement of this lyrical sense, the poet has also introduced its religious and philosophical poetry by using the words pleasant, famous, virtuous, salvation, etc
 shringaar ras varnan main jayadev kalidas kii parampara main aate hai
 The description of Geetgovind is comparable to the description of Srimad Bhagwat; And in the Akrur eulogy in Srimad 10, chapter 40 of Srimad Bhagwat, which describes Dashavatara, it corresponds to the praise description of the first canto of Geetgovind
 aage chalakar gitgovind ke anek ‘anukriti’ kavy rache gayi
 Therefore Jayadeva himself wrote in the 12th canto - kumbhkarna pranit ‘rasikapriya’ tikaa aadi main isaki pushti kii gayi he
 Due to the popularity and beauty of Geetgovind, it has been translated into prose and verse in every language of India and in English, Latin, French, German, Arabic, Persian etc
 languages
 iske alaava sanskrit bhashaa main iske jo anuwaad, bhashya, tikaa or tippanee likhe gayi hai, vaisaa kisi anya bhashaa main milanaa asambhav he
 Some commentators have described it as a beautiful poetry, while some have given importance to the Bhakti community and considered it as devotional poetry; So, by giving priority to music, it has given it the form of music and some commentators have interpreted the word etymologically with respect to the melody and beauty
 isliye nihsandeh gitgovind ek sarvatantra swatantra granth he
 Udayanacharya, the first commentator of Geetgovind, has written 'bhavavibhavini' commentary
 jagannatha puri ke atyant nikat praachi ke kinare rahanevaale udaynacharya jadyadev ke priy mitra tathaa prashansak the
 Between 1170 and 1198, 'bhavavibhavini' commentary was written, which contains 100 verses
 isaki teen maatrikas udaipur or nagpur main uplabdh hai
 There are twelve cantos in the 'geetgovind' poetry, which is divided into twenty-four arrangements
 in prabandhon kaa upavibhaajan padon athwa geeton main hua he
 Each verse or song has eight verses
 geeton ke vaktaa krishna, radha athwa radha kii sakhi hai
 All other forms of Indian love - elation, jealousy, anticipation, despair, anger, honor, reunion, and joy, etc
 - are described with great tenacity and skill, except with extreme despair and nihvadhi-disconnection
 prem ke in sabhi roopon kaa varnan atyant rochak, saras or sajiv hone ke atirikt itnaa sundar he ki aisa prathit hota he, maano kavi shaastra, arthath chintan ko bhaavana kaa rup athwa amoort ko moort rup dekar use kavita main parinit kar rahaa he
 Samodamodar akleshkeshav Enchanted madhusudan snigdh madhusudan Sankaksha Pundriksha kunthabaikuntha Nagarnarayan bilakshyalakshmipathi Mandmakund chatur chaturbhuj Sanand damodar supritipitambar Geetgovind is such a poetic work written in the 12th century that tells us about the love of Lord Krishna and Radharani
 isame kul 12 adhyay he
 This poem is the work of Jayadeva, a Brahmin living in a village named Bhubaneswar and Puri in the central state of Odisha state, in the central Kendubilva or Kenduli regime
 jayadev ne unki patni padmavati ke sahayata se is ko aisi rupaantar kiya ki tatkalin utkal ke raja irsha karne lage
 Then, when the principal Jagannathji of Geetagovind told the king in a dream, the devasis of the temple started offering the Odissi dance form in front of Lord Jagannath in the solitary service of the night and in the morning service
 pahele vidwano k maananaa tha ki jayadev bengal ke raja ke sabhakavi he
 But the inscriptions and ancient temples which are present in Odisha proved that Jayadev was a devotee of Jagannath and a resident of Utkal kingdom
 aaj bhi orishi nrity ke madhyam se gitgovind sarvajneen priy ho rahaa he
 The Odissi dance itself indicates Jaydev to be the Odisha province
 unki gitgovind kavy ki prachaar padoshi andhra, tamilnadu tathaa karnataka main hua
 Then it took place in North India, especially in Rajasthan by Mirabai
 gurugranth sahib main bhi bhagat jayadev kaa naam likh he jo gitgovind ke rachayita hai
 The composition and skill of 'geetgovind' poetry is so new and so fundamental that it is difficult to decide its poetry
 kuch paashchaatya vidvan ise ‘graamy-roopak’ kehete hai, to anya sameekshak ise ‘geetinataka’ kehete hai, to kach anyon ke mat main yah kavy ‘parishkrut yatra’ he
 Pichel accepts this poem as a 'musical metaphor'
 levi ise geet or roopak kaa madhyavarti athwa samanvit rup maanate hai, parantu jayadev ne apni is kriti kaa sargon main vibhaajan karke ise naatak ke sthaan par kavy maanane kii apni dharna kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 It is worth mentioning here that in this poetry there is nothing like drama, preface etc
 kuch vidvan ise ‘shringaar mahakavy’ kii sangya bhi dete hai
 Krishnaswamy Iyengar, in his book 'A History of Indian Opera', has considered 'gitagovind' poetry as a complete form of music and its development and excellent acceptance in the sixteenth-century Sri Tirthanarayana Swamy's work 'krishnilila Tarangini'
 is sambandh main acharya baldev upaadhyaay kaa anumaan par aadhrut kathan he ki ‘gitgovind’ ke padon ke saath raagon or taalon ke diye gayi naamon se is tathy kaa anumaan hota he ki kavi kii drushti kadachit un dinon bengal main prachlit yatra mahotsavon kii ore rahi ho, jisamen nrity or sangeet ke saath geeton kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 On this basis, this poem can also be considered as 'musical form'
 maanviya soundarya ke chithran main prakruti ko bada hi mahatvapurn sthaan praapt he
 In this context, in the 'geetgovind' poetry, a beautiful description of Rituraj Vasant, chandra-jyotsna, Surbhit Samir and the seductive keys of the Yamuna coast is seen
 yahaan tak ki is kavy main pakshi tak prem kii shakti or mahima kaa gaan karte hue drushtigochar hote hai
 Jayadeva has used the Vaidarbhi ritual — a style of melodious expressive characters — in this poem
 kavy main kahin-kahin deergh samaason kaa prayog avashya hua he, parantu phir bhi durbodhata athwa clishtataa nahin aane paayi
 In fact, the poet had composed songs only for the songs of the common people on special festivals
 atah unhen subodh rakhana aavashyak hi tha
 The songs not only have exceptional naturalness, but they also have unique melody
 ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana-style kii prashansa main mcdonal kaa kathan he—‘‘soundarya main, sangitamay vachanopanyas main or rachana ke saushthav main sampoorn sanskrit sahitya main ‘gitgovind’ kavy style kii upama nahin milti
 It is clear from the study of poetry that the poet has an amazing ability to make a tremendous impact on his readers and listeners, by the fast stream of short posts, and sometimes by the rhythmic movement of long compositions composed with tact
 kavi naanaa chhandon ke prayog main hi siddhhast nahin, apitu charnon ke madhya or ant main tukatmakataa laane main bhi adwitiya he
 '' ‘gitgovind’ kavy main jayadev ne paramparaagat rachana-pranali kaa anusaran na karke sarvatha naveen or moulik style ko apanaaya he
 The unique use of poetry and melody has been created through the mixed use of verses, prose and song
 kavi ne katha-sutara ke nirvaah ke liye apekshit drishyayojna athwa avasthaa vishesh ke chithran jaise varnanaatmak prasangon main shlokon kaa prayog kiya he
 Prose has been used in interactive contexts that inform the mood of the characters and expressions of emotion have been expressed in verses
 is prakaar ‘gitgovind’ main apanaayi gayi abhinav rachana-pranali main varna, samvaad or geet paraspar is prakaar gunth gayi hai ki unase ek vilakshan anand kii anubhuti hoti he
 Jaidev, the inventor of this unique composition-style, is his own superior
 radha-krishna kii keli-kathaon tathaa unki abhisar-lilaon kaa rasmay chithran ‘gitgovind’ ko aadhyatmik shringaar kaa manoram granth bana detaa he
 This poetic portrayal of radha-krishna's love of life in various poems of love — hope, despair, excitement, jealousy, anger, honor, resentment, ecstasy, message-sending and union, etc
 — is in this poem
 One does not find anywhere even when searching elsewhere
 shrikrishna ke gopiyon ke saath raas-vilaas ko radha na pasand karti he or na hi sahan kar paati hai
 Radha sends her resentment to Shri Krishna through her sakhi, but that unique praniyani is not satisfied with this much, her loving dependence-heart makes her personally reveal her deep affection towards her beloved
 
 radha ke aane par shrikrishna braj-sundariyon kaa sang chhodkar uski ore unmukh hote hai
 Radha's sakhi is a poignant description of the intense affection of Shri Krishna to Radha and Radha to Sri Krishna with each other and the transcendental pain experienced when they are away from each other
 vah apane komal evam kamaneey vachanon dwaara donon ko ek-duusare se milane ke liye prerit karti he
 Radha, impatient with the pangs of anguish when it is moonlight, is unable to control her incestuous affection and is forced into her expression
 shrikrishna ke aane par ati maan karti hui radha upalambh se bhare vachanon ke dwaara unke prati apana rosh-aakrosh prakat karti he
 Here, Radha's friend requests Radha to leave Maan, while Sri Krishna himself tries to persuade and make him friendly, while praising Radha's beauty and beauty
 antatah radha kaa maan dur ho jaataa he or vah apane kaant se milane ke liye kadamb-kunj main jaati he
 While praying to Shri Krishna Radha there, plead with him to give up shame and inhibition and to cooperate in the rituals
 donon prasann man se rati krida main pravrutt hote hai or iske uparant radha pranaysikt vachanon se apane priyatam shrikrishna se apana shringaar karne ko kahati he
 Giving glory to his pranapriya's request, Shri Krishna gladly adorns Radha with his own hands
 aaj ke kuch aalochak jayadev par bhakthi ke aalamban radha-krishna ko shringaar kaa aalamban banane kaa doshaaropan karte hai, parantu maadhurya bhav ke upaask kavi par yah laanchhan anyaaypurna hi nahin, apitu swayan unke apane avivek kaa dyotak he
 In fact, the expression of extreme elitism of solitude or immersion available in married couples, and the expression of clairvoyance of the imagination of the impenetrable in distinction, creates a sense of melody in the field of devotion
 madhur bhav se bhajan karne vaale bhakton ke liye bhagwaan kii shringarik cheshtaaen, vilaas-lilaayen tathaa prem-gaathaayen hi gey evam kirtaneey hai
 It is worth mentioning here that scholars have accepted all this poetry as an 'unprepared praise', an attempt to express the satire hidden in the talk
 unke mat ke anusaar shrikrishna ‘jeevon kii aatma’ ke pratik hai
 The game of gopis is that type of prapancha, in which the souls of humans trapped in ignorance are wandering
 radha brahmanand kaa pratik he, jise praapt karne par hi jeevatma ko charam sukh kii prapti hoti he
 According to some scholars, Jayadev was not a worshiper of Radha but was a worshiper of Shri Krishna
 atah shrikrishna manushyon kii aatma ke pratik na hokar paramatma ke pratik hai
 Acclaiming this fact, Acharya Baldev Upadhyaya writes - "shringar-shiromani Sri Krishna is the representative of Bhagavat-tattva and his beloved gopikas are the symbol of the creature
 radha-krishna kaa milan jeev-brahm kaa milan he
 In this way, the mystery of many facts of cultivation path is solved here
 ’’ 'gitagovind' is indeed a unique and wonderful book, in which the stream of mysterious melody is flowing in the end of boisterous beauty
 samgr sanskrit sahitya main is koti kii madhur rachana duusari koi nahi
 If you want to observe the culmination of beauty and melody of Sanskrit Bharati, then 'geetagovind' should be followed
 iske shabdachitron se soundarya maano chhalakta he
 The elegance of its songs communicates supernatural melody
 iske chhandon kaa naad-soundarya apurv anand pradaan karata he
 The harmony of words and meanings is so enchanting that even a person unfamiliar with Sanskrit cannot live without being influenced by it
 isaki-si komalkant padaavalee sansar kii kisi bhi bhashaa ke kavy main durlabh he
 Even in long spells used in this poetry, there is unique prasadikta and melody
 anupras ke prayog main to kavi adwitiya he
 The use of alliteration in his songs continues not only at the end of the posts but also in the middle
 lalit chhandon or komalkant padaavalee kaa aisa mani-kanchan sanyog hua he ki geeton ke uccharan maatr se sahrudayon ke hriday main tadnurup ras kaa aavirbhaav evam sanchaar hone lagata he
 This unique style has proved very meaningful for the euphemism of dressing
 ‘gitgovind’ ko badi hi prasiddhi or lokapriyata mili
 The village in which Jaidev lived and composed 'geetgovind', the name of that village became Jaidevpur
 kavi ke samakaleen urisa ke shaasha raja pratap rudradev ne apane rajya ke gayakon, sangitagnon or nartakon ke liye ‘gitgovind’ ke padon ko gane kaa aadesh jari kar diya
 Maharaj honored Jayadev with the title of 'kaviraj Raja' for this poetic composition
 ‘gitgovind’ jayadev ke jivan kaal main hi paryaapt rup se prachlit evam lokapriy ho gaya tha—iske anek pramaan milte hai
 In the south, it became so popular that its verses were carved in the Dravin script on the stairs of the temple of Tirupati Balaji
 shreevallabh sampradaay main to shrimadbhagwat puraana ke samaan isaki pratishtha he
 There is a belief among Vaishnavas that where 'geetagovind' is sung, there is a presence of God
 isi se is sampradaay main ise ayogy sthaan par na gaaye jane kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he, jiskaa kathorta se paalan kiya jaataa he
 In the Vaishnava community, the poet Jayadeva is considered to be the chief noble of the medieval state of this community
 sampradaay main prachlit nimnokt padya ke anusaar jis vaishnav sampradaay ke pravartan vishnu swami ne kiya or jiskaa sanvardhan mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ne kiya, us sampradaay ko in donon mahanubhavon ke madhya main bhakt kavi jayadev ne sangrakshan diya
 In this way Jayadeva is also worshipable as a Guru in the Vaishnava sect
 jayadev ne ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana karke sanskrit main ek naveen rachana-pranali kaa avishkaar kiya
 Many songs such as 'abhinav Geetagovind', 'geetraghava', 'geetagadhar' and 'krishnagit' were composed in Sanskrit on the emulation of 'gitagovind', but no poet was able to bring excellence like 'geetgovind' in his poetry
 idhar hindi main bharatendu harishchandr ne brajabhasha main iske anuwaad kaa prayaas kiya, parantu ‘sachhee kavita’ kaa anuwaad to ho hi nahin saktaa—yah ukti ‘gitgovind’ ke sambandh main aksharshah satya siddh hui he
 The translation of the essence of the original composition in translation is difficult, if not impossible
 sar wiliam jones dwaara angl bhashaa main kiye gayi ‘gitgovind’ kavy ke anuwaad par german kavi gete kii tippanee badi hi sateek he
 'A Real Poetry is that, which cannot be translated
' That is, the basis of identification of excellent poetry is that it cannot be translated into another language
 ‘gitgovind’ ke marm ko samajhane tathaa sahrudayon tak uske soundarya ko sampreshya banane ke liye pantis vidwaanon ke prayaas uplabdh hai, parantu yah kavy to vah agaadh sagar he ki isamen jo jitani gahari dubkee lagaataa he
 Equally rare and precious gems come in his hand
 katipay kaviyon dwaara is kavy ke anukaran par kavy-rachana karnaa jayadev kii kirti-kaumudi kii ujjvalata tathaa utkrushtataa kii sweekruti kaa hi parichaayak he
 The 'geetagovind' poem of devotion, adornment and poetry has another significant significance in krishna-bhakti literature
 yah sarvajan vidit tathy he ki is kavy se purv shrikrishna kii preyasi athwa patni ke rup main rukmini tathaa satyabhama aadi kaa naam hi liya jaataa tha
 There was no existence of a woman named Radha
 shrimadbhagwat puraana main ‘anairadhito nunam’ shrikrishna kii aradhana karne vaali kisi ek gopi kaa ullekh avashya hua he, parantu krishna-kavy main krishna ke saath judane vaali krishna ke hi samakaksh mahatva praapt karne vaali shrikrishna kii premika-patni radha kaa ullekh kahin nahin hua
 'geetagovindakar' Jaidev has the credit for making Radha distinguished at this high place — the exclusive companion of Shri Krishna and integral to him and his eternal strength
 is granth main chitrit radha-krishna ke nity-vilaas ke aadhaar par hi brahmavaivart puraana main radha-krishna kii shringaar-cheshtaaon tathaa kaam-kridaaon kaa varnan hua he, parantu yah ek kathor satya he ki puranakar na to ‘gitgovind’ kavy ke varnan jaisi maryaada or shaleenta kaa nirvaah kar sakaa he or na hi varnan ko vaisaa saras, rochak evam hridaygrahya bana sakaa he
 In this area too, Jaidev is his superior

 The Kepler telescope has discovered a cyclic binary asterisk
 iske antargat do taare ek duusare kaa chakkar laga rahe hai or ek upgrah in donon ke chaaron ore chakkar laga rahaa he
 The solar system is named Kepler-16b and the names of both stars are 34b and 35b respectively
 kepler 22 bi ek saura mandal ke baahar kaa grah he
 It has been discovered by the Kepler space telescope
 yah grah awasaiya kshetra main paaya gaya he
 It is the first planet under the Kepler mission to have been found in its Sun's habitable zone
 kepler 22 bi grah kii kuch pramukh visheshtaayen is prakaar hai- Amoeba is a lineage in the biological classification and members of this lineage are also often called amoeba

 Some related species are important parasites and pathogens

 In structure, it resembles a small pile of mace, whose shape changes slowly
 koshikaras baahar kii ore atyant sookshm koshakala ke aavaran se surakshit rahata he
 Two clear levels of kosharas can be identified by themselves - the clean, granular, glassy, thick outer juice on the outside and the more liquid, gray, particulate portion inside it called the inner juice
 aantar ras main hi ek bada cendrak bhi hota he
 The entire internal juice is filled with many small large food grains and one or two shrinking juices
 prayek annadhaani main bhojanapadaarth tathaa kuch taral padaarth hota he
 Digestion takes place within them
 sankochirasdhani main keval taral padaarth hota he
 It is formed in the form of a small granule, but gradually it grows and eventually bursts and its liquid comes out
 amoeba kii chalankriya badi rochak he
 There are some temporary amplifications of its body which is called Kootapada
 pehle chalan kii disha main ek kutapaad nikalataa he, phir usee kutapaad main dhire-dhire sabhi kosharas bahakar samaa jaataa he
 Only then, or together, does the new codpile begin to form
 himan, mast aadi ke anusaar kutapadon kaa nirmaan kosharas main kuch bhautik parivartanon ke kaaran hota he
 In the previous part of the body, kosharas change from liquid state to liquid position and vice versa from liquid position to gel position in the next part
 adhik gadha hone ke kaaran aage bananevaala jail koshikaras ko apni ore khinchataa he
 The amoeba accepts its food like living beings
 vah har prakaar ke carbonic kanon-jivit athwa nirjeev-kaa bhakshan karata he
 He surrounds these foods with many crypts; Then the mites of food get into the kosharas in the form of food grains with some liquid
 kosharas se annadhaani main pehle aml, phir kshareey pachak yushon kaa srav hota he, jisase protein to nishchay hi pach jate hai
 According to some people, digestion of starch and fat are also in some castes hota he
 After digestion the digested food gets exploited and the indigestible part reaches the back part of the body respectively between the movements and then it is abandoned
 parityag ke liye koi vishesh ang nahin hota
 Respiration and excretion activities occur in almost all places on the external floor of the amoeba
 inke liye vishesh angon kii aavyakataa isliye nahin hoti ki sharir bahut sookshm or pani se ghira hota he
 As the coagulation pressure of cellulose is higher than that of outside water, the water crosses Koshala and accumulates in Kosharas
 iske falswaroop sharir phulakar ant main fat ja saktaa he
 Therefore, this excess of water is collected in one or two small grains
 yah dhaani dhire-dhire badhati jaati he tathaa ek seemaa tak bad jane par fat jaati he or sara jal nikal jaataa he
 That is why it is called demise rich
 is prakaar amoeba main rasakarshan niyatrann hota he
 The amoeba becomes spherical before reproduction, its nucleus is divided into two nuclei, and then the genus is also pulled from the middle

 The entire process is completed in less than an hour

 The amoeba inside the cyst remains alive even when the water is dry
 haan, is bich uski sabhi jeevankriyaayein lagbhag nahin ke baraabar rahati hai
 This condition is often called Pranikram
 ubalata pani daalane par bhi puti ke bheetar kaa amoeba marataa nahin
 Often, the cysts and nucleus divide during the favorable season within the cyst, and when the cyst is destroyed, two or four small amoebae emerge from it
 manushya kii antadi main chah prakaar ke amibe rah sakate hai
 One of them produces a duct called amoebic flow

 In this way, wounds occur in the intestine
