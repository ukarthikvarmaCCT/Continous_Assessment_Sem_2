 Proponents of democratic globalization are sometimes called pro-globalism
 They believe that the first phase of globalization was market-oriented, constructive world-class political institutions that represent the wishes of global citizens should be followed
 The difference of other globalists is that they do not define this ideology as modern, but they will leave it for free election of these citizens through a democratic process

 Currently, critics of economic globalization see two aspects of this, one is the unforeseen damage seen in the biosphere and the other the perceived human costs, such as poverty, inequality, adulteration of races, increase in injustice, erosion of traditional culture
 According to critics, all these are the result of economic distortion related to globalization

 Nuclear acid is a polymeric macromolecule, which is made up of chains of unicellular nucleotides
 jaivaraciniki ke pariprekshya main, ye anu anuvaanshik soochna pahunchaane kaa kaam karte hai, saath hi ye koshikaon kaa dhaanchaa bhi banaate hai
 Commonly used nuclear acids are DNA or deoxy ribo nuclear acid and RNA or ribo nuclear acid

 Before giving a brief introduction to all those law-codes, it is probably appropriate that we also understand the modern meaning of the code of law so that we can also understand the modern meaning of the code of law, so that the statutes and legislatures passed on various subjects "statutes The difference of "should also become clear

 In the modern sense there has been an interdependent relationship between the development of legalism and national sentiment: for example in France the national spirit emanating from the French Revolution was the driving force behind the creation of Code Napoleon

 On the other hand, after the creation of legalism, the same legalism is helpful in developing and spreading the national spirit in that society as proven by the history of Italy

 ise electron nalee, tapayanic volve yaa keval 'tub' yaa 'volve' bhi kehete hai
 In these, the electrons emanating from a heated filament accelerate in vacuum to reach the anode which is placed at higher voltages than the cathode
 nirvaat naliyon ke pradurbhaav ne electronic ke janm or vikaas main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 The first thermogenic tube was built by Fleming in 1904, which is called bipolar
 jaisaa pehle hi likhaa ja chukaa he, dwidhruvi main do dhruv hote hai
 One pole discharges the electron and the other is placed at the money potential instead of the first pole, then the electric current flows
 parantu yah dhara ekadish hoti he
 If the plaque is placed at the money potential rather than the minus, then as mentioned above, the electron current flows
 parantu yadi vibhav ko duusari disha main lagaaya jaae, arthath yadi pattica runagra kii apeksha rin vibhav par ho, to electron dhara ekadam nahin pravaahit hogi, kyonki bina pattica ko garam kiye pattica se electron nahin niklenge
 For this reason the electron current in the tube can only flow in one direction
 yadi prayavarti dhara ke strot ko ek dwidhruvi ore vidyutiya bhaar ke, jaise kisi pratirohak ke, shreneesmbandh ke aar paar lagaaya jaay to dhara keval ek hi dish main bahegi or prayavarti ke aadhe chakra main koi dhara nahin pravaahit hogi
 In these directions, the hose allows the current to run in only one direction under load instead of alternating current
 pehle pattic dhara dhire-dhire badhati he, phir kuch shighrata se or ant main sthir ho jaati he, jise santrupt dhara kehete hai
 This saturation occurs due to the transfer charge, which is revealed near the minuscule due to stray electrons
 dwidhruvi main pattic dhara nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara pradarshit kii ja sakati he: Ip = plaque current in bipolar; k = vah niyatank jo nalee kii jyamiti par nirbhar rahata he; v = plaque voltage of bipolar jaisaa upar bataaya ja chukaa he, dwidhruvi main vidyuddhara keval ek hi disha main pravaahit hoti he
 For this reason this tube is used in alternation of alternating current
 isamen prayavarti dhara disht dhara main parivartit ho jaati he
 This is called 'half wave desorption'
 un dwidhruviyon ko, jo ucch vibhavapratyavarti dhara ke rujukaran main prayukt hote hai, kenatron kehete hai
 a gassed bipolar is used for powerful current compensation, for example the tanger resistor is a gassed resistor for induction of accumulator batteries

 He placed an additional pole between the two poles of the bipolar and found that this type of tube, called the tripolar, is very beneficial
 is tritiy dhruv kii anupasthiti main, jaisaa pehle bataaya ja chukaa he, nalee main tapayanic dhara tabhi pravaahit hoti he jab dhanagar runagra kii apeksha dhan vibhav par hota he
 This is called plaque current
 yah pattic voltata ke saath saath tab tak badhati he jab tak antaran aavesh prakat nahin hota
 It becomes stable when it appears, that is, the filler current does not increase with the increase of the band voltage
 jab tisare dhruv ko nalee ke do dhruvon ke bich main laga diya jaataa he to vah is antaran aavesh kaa niyantran karne lag jaataa he
 For this reason, the grid can be called transfer-charge-controller
 yadi grid vibhav runagra vibhav se kam rahata he to grid electranon ko peeche kii ore phenk detii he or pattic dhara kam ho jaati he
 If the grid potential is greater than the negative potential then the filler current increases
 phir, pattic dhara main grid dhara athwa grid voltata ke saath kaa parivartan ek anya laabhakaari gun he
 a slight change in grid current or grid voltage can bring substantial changes in the band current
 is yukti kaa upyog pravardhakon main karte hai
 The platonic current depends on three independent variables
 ve hai pattic voltata, grid voltata tathaa runagra ko garam karne ke liye prayukt voltata
 When the heat voltage is increased so much that enough emissions begin to occur, the current is controlled only by the transfer charge
 tab pattic voltata keval do swatantra charon kaa falan rah jaati he
 They are plate voltage and grid voltage
 is falan ko ek samtal main kisi vakr se pradarshit nahin kar sakate
 It can be displayed only in a tri-dimensional surface
 yadhyapi isprakaar kii vakr rekha se vishesh soochna praapt kii ja sakati he, to bhi isko pradarshit karne main bahut asuvidha he
 For this reason, it is represented by three types of curved lines, called static symbols
 k) hai
 As mentioned, the main use of trident is in amplifiers
 iskaa prayog dolak, rujukari, parichaayak tathaa murchak ke roopon main bhi kiya jaataa he
 The use of a tri-dipole in high frequency-amplification-action results in the loss of both circuits due to the dipole capacitor between the fillet and the grid
 is kaaran ucch aavriti par tridhruvi kaa kaary asthir ho jaataa he
 This coupling causes the valve to oscillate, causing dissonant sound
 is vighnkaaree ansh ko chaturdhruvi main dhanagar or grid ke bich main ek or grid lagaakar dur kiya jaataa he
 We put this grid on the money potential
 yah vibhav pattic ke vibhav se kam hota he
 In the presence of this grid, the positive circuit and grid circuit are not coupled and oscillations do not occur
 is grid ko aavaran grid kehete hai
 The presence of a casing grid has another advantage
 tridhruvi kii apeksha dhanagar electron bahaav ke niyatrann main kam suchetan hota he, kyonki aavaran grid dhanagar kii apeksha runagra ke adhik paas hone ke kaaran adhik prabhaavshaalee hota he
 This increases amplification
 chaturdhruvi main tridhuvi ke samaan hi niyantran grid or runagra sthapit hote hai
 Therefore, grid-plaque conductivity in both tubes is usually the same but in quadrupolar plaque resistance is sufficiently higher than that of triploid
 iskaa kaaran, jaisaa upar likhaa ja chukaa he, pattic voltata par pattic dhara kaa nunatam prabhaav he
 There is a drawback in the use of quadriplegia
 yah he pattic kaa gaun utsarjan
 When very fast thermogenic electrons collide with the band, secondary emission occurs from the band
 pattic se gaun electranon ke utsarjan dwaara or unke aavaran kii ore aakarshith ho jane ke kaaran dhanagar lakshanik main ek anthan aa jaati he
 This spasm leads to distortion and instability in the tube
 isko dur karne ke liye ek tritiy grid, aavaran grid tathaa dhanagar ke bich main, laga dete hai
 This grid is called the oppressive grid and this tube, which consists of five poles, is called Panchdhruvi
 damankaaree grid runagra se praaia: ant:sambandhit rahata he
 Its function is to suppress secondary emission electrons
 mukhya electron dhara par damankaaree grid kii upasthiti kaa koi vishesh prabhaav nahin padataa
 It only blocks secondary emissions
 panchadhruvi kaa upyog adhiktar ucch aavriti par vikrutirahit pravardhan main hota he
 This tube has often displaced the use of quadruplets in radio-frequency-voltage-amplifiers
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki panchadhruvi ke upyog se madhyam-pattic-vibhav par ucch vibhavapravardhan hota he
 In panchipolar and quadrupolar sometimes controllers do not make the grid the same with a specific intent
 donon siron par grid taron ke antaraal ko kam kar dete hai
 This type of tube acts as a parallel group of many tubes and these tubes have different amplification factors
 jaise hi grid voltata ko rinatmak kar dete hai, vaise hi grid ke ucch pravardhangunan-khand ke bhaag cat jate hai or unamem electron dhara nahin wahit hoti, kintu anya bhaagon par koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 If the grid is negative, the electric current can also flow from this part
 isliye electron dhara praaia: sthir rahati he or pravardhan gunan khand main parivartan hota rahata he
 This type of tube is called variable-tube
 iskaa upyog adhiktar swat: chaalit udghoshtaniyantrak ke paripathon main hota he
 After making quadruple and panchipolar, it was realized that the transfer charge between the casing grid and the band can be used as a secondary emission resistor
 pujanshakti nalee main antaran aavesh kaa upyog isiilie karte hai
 The stars of the helical controller grid and the cover grid are kept the same and their wires are arranged such that the electrons are assembled into a cylindrical surface between the fillet and the cover grid
 is kaaran yah belanaakaar sataha runagra ke vibhav par hoti he or pattic se utsarjit electranon ko peeche kii ore phenk detii he
 Thus it succeeds in preventing secondary emissions
 kabhi kabhi kuch vishesh punjashkti naliyon main ek ore damankaaree grid laga dete hai, parantu atanran aavesh dwaara banaai gai belanaakaar sataha gaun utsarjan ko rokane main vishesh prabhaavshaalee hoti he
 The filament of the masseter tube is characteristic in that it turns more sharply
 is kaaran punjashkti nalee ek panchadhruvi se uttam he
 The curve of the curvature is very sharp and after that it is often straight
 vakrarekha kaa kshaitij bhaag pattic voltata ke parivartan ke yathesht bhaag ke saath he
 For this reason, using this hose provides more power
 taron ko is vishesh prakaar se lagane ke kaaran punjashkti naliyon main panchadhruvi kii apeksha aavaran-grid-dhara pattic dhara se kam hoti he
 Different combinations of bipolar, triploid, quadruplic and pentipolar when they are made in the same chamber are called multi-unit tube
 is prakaar kii bahudhruvi athwa bahuikai-naliyon ke lakshanik un lakshanikon se bahut bhinn nahin hai jinka adhyayan abhi kiya gaya he
 However, there are also multipolar tubes with only one minus and only one positive, but grids are more than three
 aisi naliyon main do niyantrak grid hote hai or pattic dhara kaa niyantran donon hi voltata ke mail se hota he
 The work of other grids is either that of the casing or to suppress secondary emission from the pellet, as in quadruplex and quaternary
 kabhi kabhi ek grid kaa kaary, jo dhan vibhav par rahata he, sahaayak pattic ke rup main hota he
 The current of this plate depends on the voltage of one of the controller grids
 yadi is prakaar kii nalee main do niyantrak grid hon or donon kii hi voltataayen badalati hon to pattic dhara kaa parivartan donon gridon kii voltata ke parivartan ke ubhaynishth gunankhand ke samaanupaat main hota he
 This multiplication has made such tubes useful in circuits where special types of tillers are required
 bahudhruvi electron naliyon kaa mukhya upyog aavritiparivartan main hota he, arthath ek aavriti kii voltata ko duusari aavriti kii voltata main parivartan karne main
 An example of this is a Panchgrid mixer
 iske atirikt bahudhruvi naliyon kaa upyog visheshtya swat: chaalit udghoshtaniyantran tathaa uddaghoshtaprasarak main kiya ja rahaa he jisamen ek niyantrak grid main lagaai voltata kaa niyantran duusare niyantrak grid main lagaai gai voltata ke dwaara hota he

 Buddhist philosophy refers to the philosophy that was developed by various sects of Buddhism after Lord Buddha's nirvana and later spread throughout Asia
 'dukh se mukti' buddha dharm kaa sadaa se mukhya dhyey rahaa he
 Karma, meditation and wisdom have been its means

 The notion of functional truth is a fundamental feature of Buddhism
 upanishdon kaa brahm achal or aparivartansheel he
 According to Buddha, change is the truth
 pashchimi darshan main hairaclitis or bergasaan ne bhi parivartan ko satya mana
 There is also no irreversible basis for this change
 bahya or aantarik jagat main koi dhruv satya nahin he
 External substances are the effects of "observations"

 buddha darshan apane praarambhik kaal main jain darshan kii hi bhanti achaarshastra ke rup main hi tha
 Later on the basis of the teachings of the Buddha, various scholars gave it a spiritual form and created a strong philosophical philosophy
 buddha dwaara sarvapratham sarnath main diye gayi upadeshon main se chaar aryasaty is prakaar hai :- ‘dukhsamudayaniropmargtvararyabuddhasyabhimatani tattwani
 'means - buddhabhimat in chaaron tattvon main se dukhsamudaay ke antargat dwadashanidaan tathaa dukhanirodh ke upayon main ashtangmarg kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Apart from this, the Panchsheel and Dwadash volumes from which one should work properly are also important in terms of ethics
 vastutah chaar arya satyon kaa vishad vivechan hi buddha darshan he
 The primary category of Buddhist philosophy was the Department, with the important question of power, which is known as the four departures
 ye arth ko gyaan se yukt arthath pratyakshgamya maanate hai
 They consider externalism permissible
 yadhyapi bahyajagat kii satta donon sweekaar karte hai, kintu drushti ke bhed se ek ke liye chitt nirpeksh tathaa duusare ke liye chitt saapeksh arthath anumey satta he
 The state of power in Sautrantikism is introverted from the outside
 inke anusaar buddhi hi aakaar ke saath he arthath buddhi main hi bahyarth chale aate hai
 Eternal sciences continue to arise in the mind, ie in science
 kshanbhangini chitt santati kii satta se sabhi vastuon kaa gyaan hota he
 In fact, they completely eliminate external power
 inke yahan madhyamik mat ke samaan satta do prakaar kii maani gai he- In practical terms, the two forms of design and change are acceptable
 yahan chitt kii hi pravriti tathaa nivritti hoti he
 All things are a substitute for the mind
 ise hi aalayavigyaan kehete hai
 This is the progeny of epistemology
 yahan bahya evam antah donon sattaaon kaa shunya main vilyan hua he, jo ki anirvachaneey he
 They consider knowledge only in themselves and accept two types of truth - baudhon ke in chaaron sampradaayon main se pratham do kaa sambandh hinayan se tathaa antim donon kaa sambandh mahayan se he
 The Hinayani sect is realistic and totalitarian, whereas among the Mahayani sects, Yogachary accepts the idea as the ultimate essence and ultimate form
 madhyamik darshan ek nishedhaatmak evam vivechanaatmak paddati he
 This is why secondary nihilism is also known as 'totalitarianism'
 hinayan tathaa mahayan kii anyaanya anek shakhaayen hai, jo ki prakhyat nahin hai- According to Buddhists, the object changes continuously and no substance remains more than a moment
 koi bhi manushya kisi bhi do kshanon main ek sa nahin rah saktaa, isiliye aatma bhi kshanik he or yah siddhanth kshanikwaad kehalaata he 
 For this, Buddhist Matanuayi often give the analogy of Deepshikha
 jab tak deepak jalataa he, tab tak uski lau ek hi shikha prathit hoti he, jabaki yah shikha anekon shikhaon kii ek shrinkhalaa he
 The crest arising from one drop is different from the crest arising from the second drop; But the continuous flow of crest brings about the feeling of unity

 Thus, this theory is the middle path between 'nihilism' and 'scarcity'
 ‘prathithyasamutpaada’ se taatpary ek vastu ke praapt hone par duusari vastu kii utpatti athwa ek kaaran ke aadhaar par ek kaary kii utpatti se he
 The actual counterpart is both relative and absolute
 saapeksh drushti se vah sansar he or nirpeksh drushti se nirvana
 It is the path between eternalism and abolitionism as in ephemeralism; That is why it is called Madhyam Marg and it is considered secondary

 According to Hindu scriptures, "ahimsa" means always and always zeeshan lack of malice with all beings

 The magnitude of the non-violence of the listener is much less than that of the sage

 Jain non-violence was extraordinary in comparison to all religions

 Because both Sanskrit and Avastai are sisters of the indo-iranian language family, its homogeneous word in Sanskrit would have been 'pravartin', which means 'one who leads'
 lekin yah shabd sanskrit main is rup main nahin miltaa or isaki bajaae sanskrit kaa sahi shabd 'pravartak' he, jiskaa arth he 'vah jo aage badaye'

 Despite being the source of Farvara's sign, it is not known that Iranian scholars who started using this sign in Zoroastrianism
 ve is chihn ke saath kya matlab jodate the
 It is important that in Iran it was first seen in royal inscriptions, so it may have been a symbol of 'khwarnah'
 'khvarnah ' shabd kaa matlab parsi dharm-granthon main 'samraat kii divya mahanata' nikalataa he, yani vah divya mahanata jo kisi shaasha yaa samraat ke saath judakar uski sahaayta kare
 It is possible that Faravahar is showing the Emperor's Froshi in these inscriptions
