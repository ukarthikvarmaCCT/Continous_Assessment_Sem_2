 His father's name is said to be Santokh Das and mother's name is Kalsa Devi
 raidas ne sadhu-santon kii sangati se paryaapt vyaavhaarik gyaan praapt kiya tha
 His ancestral business was shoe-making, and he happily embraced it
 ve apana kaam puri lagan tathaa parishram se karte the or samay se kaam ko puraa karne par bahut dhyaan dete the

 His plays in Prayag not only appeared in 'chand', 'rupabh' magazines, but he participated in plays like 'veer Abhimanyu', etc
 'bhor kaa tara' main sangrahit sari rachanaayen prayag main hi likhi gayi
 The name is symbolically the 'star of the dawn' of Mathur's creative personality both in terms of craft and compassion
 iske baad kii rachanaaon main samakaleenta or parampara ke prati gaharaai kramshah badhati gai he
 Individuals, events, and experiences from various historical sites of the country have played an important role in the creation

 Mathur ji's plays have curiosity and wayward loveliness
 'bhor kaa tara' main kavi shekhar kii bhavukta paryaavaran main ghatit karne yaa rachane kaa moh bhi prarambh se miltaa he
 But 'konark' is the proof of the creative possibility of the urge to prove the authenticity through contemporary culture by realizing the contemporary as an experience
 parampara ko madhyam or sandarbh ke rup main prayog karne kii kala main maathur siddahast hai
 But this does not mean that this is what they all have, but they also wrote backbones, etc
, which are related to the changing relationships and human relations within the society
 'sharadiya' ke saare naatakon main samasya ko vyapak pariprekshya main rakhkar dekhne kaa abhas avashya he, parantu samasya maatr kaa parivritt itnaa chota he ki vah kisi vyapak satya kaa aadhaar nahin ban paati
 Mathur is in fact the creator of the shadowy sensation
 yah samvednaa 'bhor kaa tara' se lekar 'pehla raja' tak main kamobesh milti he
 It is a must that this chauvinism has been deeply cremated in 'konark' and 'pehla Raja' due to the legislative rites of the play and its deep association to reality
 'konark' uttam naatak he
 History, culture and contemporaneity together confirm the notion of the Tribal and the belief in human truth
 ghatana kii tathyata or naatakeeyata ke baavjood mahashilpi vishu kii chintaa or dharmapad kaa sahaspurn prayog, vyavastha kii adhinayakawadi pravriti se ladane or jujhne kii prakriya evam uski parinti kaa sanket naatak ko mahatvapurn rachana bana detaa he
 The creative power of imagination and contemporary experience of culture is the reason for Konark's successful theatrical work
 konark ke ant or ghatnatmak tivrata tathaa parisamapti par vivaad sambhav he, parantu uske sampreshnatmak prabhaav par prashn chinh sambhav nahin he
 Using the composition and atmosphere of the play 'first King' as a medium and 'reference', the author has tried to explain the human relationship between the system and the Prajhit

 The importance of tradition in the contemporary context and the possibility of its use in the context of plays and their utility related to Ramlila, Raslila etc
 is also discussed

 Lari is also another word for truck
 bhuprushthiya parivartanon ke adhyayan ko bahudhaa gatikeey bhuvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 It is clear that this name refers to the dynamic state of the dorsal environment, but nowadays this name is not particularly popular and physical geology is more prevalent in its place
 is vigyaan ke teen mukhya ang hote hai, jo is prakaar hai : Transportation of surface rocks by decay, erosion and denudation and sedimentation, etc
 avsaad kaa sanchayan tathaa Addition and consolidation of accumulated depression jo prakritik kaarak prishthiya padaarth ko prabhavit karte hai, ve apane kreedakshetra kii paristhiti ke anusaar do vargon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai : Surface and aantbhom Among them, the functional energies of the surface factors mainly and dynamically originate from the Sun
 is varg main vayumandal ke vibhinn avyav, varsha ityadi, aantbhom jal or sote, nadi tathaa himandi, samudr tathaa jhil vishesh ullekhneey hai
 Their playground is mainly the land area of the geosphere, which will also include the coastline
 samudr ke nital par inkaa kuch prabhaav nahin padataa or prishth ke gahare bhaagon main bhi inaki praveshyata apekshaakrit ati sookshm hoti hai
 The main source of the energy of visceral factors is the internal heat of the earth
 is varg main patalvirupan jwalamukhi krida, ushn or bukamp ityadi aate hai
 It is clear that their original playing area is below the surface and the effects generated from them are sometimes above the ground and never come
 vayumandal main chaar aise mukhya avyav hai jo bhuprishth ke prati kaaryshil rahete hai: varsha, taap parivartan, tushaar or vaayu
 Rainfall is a very common, but extremely powerful factor
 iske kaary kii vidhi kuch rasinic or kuch balkrit hoti he
 Absolutely pure water often lacks the ability to carry out chemical reactions
 yadhyapi varshajal prithvi par pahunchne se purv adhikansh shuddh hota he, phir bhi akaashmaarg se aate samay usamen vayumandaleey oxigen or carbon dioxide donon hi paryaapt maatra main villin ho jate hai
 By the reaction of oxidized and carbonized rainwater, many minerals of dorsal rocks are converted into oxides and carbonates according to their nature
 kuch khanij, athwa anke anu, jal ke saath rasinic yogic hydrate bhi bana lete hai
 In this way, the rocks are decomposed by the chemical activity of the Salalaya
 nae bane hue padaarthon main kuch viley hote hai or kuch aviley
 With the formation of solute fragments, they dissolve in water and insoluble fragments are left there
 aviley bhaag main mitti ke anu or baaluu ityadi hote hai, jo kalantar main sanchit hokar vividh bhanti kii mitti ke str banaate hai
 Sometimes the insoluble material does not get an opportunity to accumulate, but the rain water flows on the ground completely or partially, carrying it with you
 jab tak jal main padaarth ko baha le jane kii shakti rahati he, tab tak vah bahata chalaa jaataa he or shakti ke ksheen hone par vah jahaan tahaan baith jaataa he
 In this way, it is called the matter that is shed by rainwater
 isaki maatra dharaatal kii dhaal or varsha kii gati par nirbhar hoti he
 Both the slope gradient and the intensity of rainfall increase the power of rainwater to flow
 varsha kii kriya ke parinaamon par sthaneey jalwaayu kaa bhi bahut prabhaav padataa he, yadi do pradeshon main vaarshik varsha kii maatra praaia: samaan ho, kintu ek main halake halake chhinte baar baar padate hon or duusare main kabhi kabhi kintu bahut teevr varsha hoti ho, to in donon pradeshon main varsha kaa prabhaav bhinn bhinn hoga
 In the same way, the effect of rainfall is completely different even in the alternating regions of dry and rainy seasons
 taap kii vibhinnata kaa bhi varsha kii kriyasheeltaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In tropical countries, the power to decompose rain water is much higher than in cold countries
 baari baari se garmi or sardi ke prabhaav main padakar chattaane shanai: shanai: chhin bhinn hokar mote yaa maheen chure ke rup main parivartit ho jaati hai
 It is a common quality of matter that it spreads under the influence of heat and shrinks when it gets cold
 failane evam sikudne kii maatra dravyavishesh par nirbhar hoti he, arthath koi dravya adhik failata he or koi kam
 Many rocks are made of two, three or more minerals
 at: din kii garmi main ye sab khanij apane apane gunon ke anusaar failte hai or raatri main thande hote hue sikudte hai
 The algal mineral is less dispersed, the more the algal
 jo khanij adhik failata he, vah dusron par ek prakaar kaa dabaav daalata he jisase kan chhin bhinn hone lagate hai
 Day by day due to this process, the effect increases and over time the upper layers of rocks become powdery
 pratyaksh he ki din or raat ke taap main jitna hi adhik antar hoga, utane hi adhik veg se shilaayein chhin bhinn hongi
 In this process the chemical composition of minerals does not change at all, only the mutual bonds of the minerals become so loose that they separate from each other
 isi se is kriya ko vighatan kehete hai
 By the combined action of both precipitation and temperature change, which are often in nature, shilaon ke apghaton or vighatan donon ko protsaahan miltaa he
 The action of frost is also only strengthened
 is kaarak kii shakti kaa strot yah saamaanya vrutt he ki 4 degree sein0 par jal kaa aapekshik ghanatv adhiktam hota he
 This causes the density to decrease when it becomes more frosty, that is to say, in other words, the volume of water increases
 0 degree sein0 par jab jal barf main roopantarit hota he, tab uskaa aaytan praaia: dashamang bad jaataa he
 Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to keep in mind that during the installation of ice by artificial method, there should be a blank space in the vessel for increased volume of snow
 is sthaan ke abhaav main failati hui barf ke dabaav se paatr ke foot jane kii ashanka haati he
 According to this circle, when rocks in cold countries come under the influence of frost, their limbs become disjointed
 shilaon ke chhidron or vidaron main jal ghus jaataa he or vah prati din sardi paane par jamata he or garmi paane par pighalta he
 This makes the elements of the upper layers of the rocks weak and often unrelated in some time
 baad main varsha tathaa vaayu aadi ke aghat se ve sahaj hi chur chur ha jate hai
 Often this effect of blight is explosive
 sheetapradhan dashon ke un bhaagon main jahaan vanaspati kam ho, khuli, anaachhadit chattane is prakaar toote hue shail khandon se dhaki rahati hai evam pahadiyon ke talon main is prakaar se bane khandon kii badi rashiyaan ekatrit ho jaati hai, jise shailamalaba kehete hai
 These segments have no fixed shape and their corners are often pointed and sharp
 shail vighatan ke liye tushaar bahut hi shaktishaalee kaarak he, kintu iskaa kaaryakshetra keval sheetapradhan pradesh hi he
 Typical playground areas of the air are deserts and high altitude regions, where it flows most often
 anukool paristhitiyon main isamen balkrit apradan karne kii apurv kshamta hoti he
 The main secret of its power lies in the fact that it blows away countless small sand and soil particles at great speed
 prachand vaat main behate hue ye kan barambar ek duusare se takaraate hai, jisase apgharshan hota he or shanai: shanai: kan laghutar hote jate hai
 Also, the mountains, rocks and stone blocks that come in the path of the storm, on top of them, they also blow like sand, due to which all of them are defiled
 saadharantaya baaluu dharaatal se adhik oonchaai tak nahin uth paati
 For this reason, the height of the erosion-action area of the air is also limited by the same ratio
 falat: bahudhaa registani pradeshon main pahadiyon or chattaanon ke nichle bhaag to apgharshit ho patale evam sankeern ho jate hai, kintu upar kaa dhad aprabhavit chhot jaataa he
 This type of adornment makes some unique shapes like mushrooms etc
 registani pradeshon main vaayu kii disha praaia: bahut samay tak samaan bani rahati he, jisase inaki apgharshan or apradan kii disha bhi bahut samay tak aparivartit rahati he
 For this reason, the airborne spheres in the desert are angular and flakey, rather than chubby
 vastut: inke liye golashm shabd anupyukt he or uske sthaan par german shabd dricanter kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Air has the unique power of transport along with erosion
 maheen baaluu or dhul ke kanon ko bade vishaal pariman main vaayu varsh prati varsh registani pradeshon se udaakar le jaati he or aise sthanon main nickshepit kar detii he jahaan uskaa veg kam ho jaataa he or ghaas evam jhaadiyaan uske maarg main rukaawat daalati hai
 In this way, the deposits of the transported substance are called aerated sand and aerated clay
 uttari china main is prakaar se bani vaiudh mrittika kaa ek bada vishaal nikshep hai, jisaki motaai 300 se 450 meter tak he or jise vaayu madhya asia ke registaanon se uda kar yahan le ai he
 Some part of the water brought by rain goes back into the atmosphere by evaporation, some flows into the sea by the way of flowing rivers and some gets absorbed into the earth
 jo bhaag dharaatal par bah jaataa he, use apvaah kehete hai or jo prishth main ant:sravit hota he, use bhumigat athwa aantbhaum jal kehete hai
 The reciprocal ratio of these three parts depends on the local climate, topography and geology
 adrr jalwaayu ke pradeshon main vashpikaran kii maatra prabal hoti he
 In areas of similar climate, the amount of runoff water increases with the heterogeneity of the topography
 bhoumiki kaa vrutt bhi atyant mahatvapurn hota he, kyonki kuch shilaayein bahut randhri to hoti hai, par saath hi unki praveshya bahut alp hoti he, jese shail or mrittika
 Apart from these, a third category of rocks is neither random nor pervious, like granite
 at: ant:sravit jal kii maatra sthanvishesh ke shailon ke bhautik lakshanon par nirbhar hoti hai
 Upon reaching some depth in the ground, the land and rock are saturated with water
 santrupti kii sataha ko bhunmalaj str kehete hai
 Depth of this level is dependent on the amount of annual rainfall of the particular area, the topography and the local geological structure
 saadharantaya bhumjalantar sookhe pradeshon kii apeksha adrr kshetron main dhartal ke sameep hota he
 Even in the adjoining parts of the sea, lake, lake and big rivers, this level is relatively close to the surface
 sookhaa pad jane se yah gaharaai main chalaa jaataa he or ati vrishti hone par upar aa jaataa he
 The depth to which the visceral water can penetrate the surface is also dependent on the composition of local rocks
 jal shailakanon ke bich ke randhri sthanon or vivaron main samaa jaataa he, at: jitani gaharaai tak shailon main randhra, athwa vidar honge, utani hi dur tak aantbhaum shailon ke dabaav ke kaaran adhikansh vidar main sandhital band ho jate hai
 Stagnation can also be short
 aisi sthiti main aantbhaum jal adhik gaharaai main na jaakar pashrv kii ore agrasar hone lagata he
 Ultimately, its target is the sea
 kabhi to yah bhumigat margo se hi vahaan pahunch jaataa he or kabhi use aise maarg mil jate hai, jinase vah pun: dharaatal par soton ke rup main pahunch jaataa he
 In addition to open and wide walls and resources, the flow of visceral water elsewhere is very slow
 isi kaaran usamen kisi prakaar kii balkrit kriya karne kii shakti nahin hoti, kintu anukool paristhitiyon main yah rasinic kriya avashya kar saktaa he
 Moving transverse to the fissure and backbone, it, like rainwater, oxidizes, carbonizes, or hydrates the minerals of the walls of the walls, thus decomposing the shell
 jis bhubhag main chuunaapatthar ke shail hon, vahaan aantbhaum jal ko kaary karne kaa bahut bada kshetra mil jaataa he
 Limestone dissolves in carbonized water
 at: chuunaapatthar ke sttaron main se bahata hua jal uske anekanek bhaagon ko villin kar guphaayen bana daalata he
 Sometimes the size of this type of caves is large, up to several hundred meters long and 4-5 meters deep and the flowing water from these forms the gut river
 kahin kahin carbonatoyukt jal gupha kii chat se tapakane lagata he
 Some part of the dripping water evaporates and evaporates and the solute calcium carbonate precipitates at the dripping site
 ek hi sthaan par boondon ke barambar tapakane ore usee sthaan par calcium carbonate ke nirantar avakshepan se ek stambhakar raashi ban jaati he, jise stellectite kehete hai
 Similar action is also caused by evaporation of the dripping water on the floor of the cave and from that the precipitated carbonate forms a columnar shape that rises from the floor to the ceiling
 in akritiyon kii stalegmite kehete he
 Sometimes stalagmites move towards each other to form a continuous column from the roof of the cave to the floor
 kabhi is prakaar avakshepit carbonate kii raashi kaa koi vishisht rup nahin hota
 In this case it is called calc nisad, tufa or travertine
 kinhin kinhin gufaaon main is prakaar avakshepit carbonate kii maatra itani vishaal ho jaati he ki aise carbonate se vyavsaay chal saktaa he
 It has been mentioned above that sometimes the gut water returns to the ground again as springs
 yah ghatana sthaneey shailon ke vishisht vinyas ke upar nirbhar karti he
 If a sandstone rock, su, is configured in such a way that its top and bottom are completely or often inaccessible rocks, clay, shale or other rocks of the same quality, then the intrusive water is leaking into the stomatal rock, the impermeable rock
 After reaching the upper contact level, the gradient of the levels will begin to increase in the lateral direction
 usee disha main jahaan kahin vah shail kisi prakritik kaat main anaachhadit ho pragat hoga, to us sthaan par aantbhaum jal soton ke rup main bahane lagegaa
 Often the fauna present in rocks also helps in the formation of springs
 yadi kisi bhransh ke kaaran kaai apargamya shail visthapit hokar randhri or pargamya shail ke saannnidhya main avasthit ho jaay to us sthaan par jahaan bhranshatal kisi prakritik kaat ke anuprastha anaachhadit hoga, vahaan sote footne lagenge
 The mineral water always contains a small amount of mineral matter
 jab inaki maatra bhaar ke anusaar 1 prati shat se adhik ho, tab use khanij sota kehete hai
 But in normal practice, any spring, which has some specific taste due to the mineral content dissolved in the water, is called mineral spring
 par sarsaadhaaran vyavhaar main kisi bhi aise sote ko, jiske pani main villin khanij padaarth ke kaaran kuch vishisht swaad ho, khanij sota kehete hai; kintu calcium carbonate jaise khanij bahut prachur maatra main hone par bhi kuch swaad nahin dete or magnesium ke lavan ati alp maatra main bhi swaad dene lagate hai
 The water of the springs is often subject to pressure
 pani ke baahar aate hi dabaav main kami ho jaati he or uske saath pani kii vileyata main bhi hraas ho jaataa he
 Therefore, mineral material is often precipitated at the point of origin of springs
 is padaarth kaa sanghatan praaia: churnik athwa silicy hota he or ye nikshep sanghatan ke anusaar, calk nisaad, athwa silicy nisaad kehalaate hai
 Sometimes iron carbonate, or other salts, or sulfur also precipitate
 kisi kisi sote kaa pani bahut garam hota he or kabhi kabhi pani radioective bhi hota he
 Rajgiri hot water fountain is very famous in the state of Bihar
 in soton kaa pani praayay: prishth ke bahut gahare bhaagon se aata he
 The water of some springs is not only of visceral origin but also of magmatic origin, that is, water in a remote womb containing the vapor emitted from the magmatic substance
 aise sote ko megmiy sota kehete hai
 Somewhere the water is present in such a special situation that by making a well at that place, the water automatically rises up and at some places the water rises like a fountain bouncing up to several meters above the ground
 inhen utsrut coop kehete hai
 The compulsory entry restrictions for these formation are: Intermittent water is stored inside a porous and inaccessible rock with impermeable rocks on both the top and bottom, blocking the flow of water in the direction of the level prone and water
 The original source of the water should be at such a height from the place of making the well that desirable liquid static pressure is produced, due to which the water will rise to the surface automatically when the well is formed
 Su get up madras praant ke dakshin arket jile main naiveli sthaan par, jahaan peet ke vishaal nikshep mili hai, bahut hi ullekhneey utsrut sthiti pai gai he
 The pressure and volume of the water released there are so high that peat excavation has been very difficult, and special means have to be used to control the water
 prakritik karkon main nadi bahut hi prabhavi tathaa kaaryshil he
 It performs erosion, transportation and deposition, all three types of work in great quantity
 yadhyapi varshajal ke kaary kaa mahatv kuch kam nahin he, phir bhi nadi kii kriya lambii evam apekshaakrit sankeern ghaatiyon main sankendrit hone ke kaaran, iskaa prabhaav va fal adhik spasht prathit hota he
 Like rainwater, the river water can also decompose the rocks of the bottom and sides of its valley by chemical action
 is prakaar utpann apaghatit padaarth kaa viley ansh nadi ke jal main ghul jaataa he or aviley bhaag bhi dhar ke saath bah jaataa he
 The river performs this action smoothly in the path of its mountainous region, because the ghar is so heavy there that the levels of new, unadulterated rocks are always uncovered, so that they come under the influence of spontaneous action
 kintu maidani pradesh main dhar kaa veg kam ho jane par, ghati kaa tal mrittika or baaluu ke aavaran se aachhadit ho jaataa he
 As a result, contact with undigested rocks also decreases
 jin pradeshon main chuunaapatthar ke shail adhik hon, vahaan rasinic kriya bahut prachur pariman main hoti rahati he, kyonki carbonati jal main chuunaapatthar sahaj hi villin ho jaataa he
 The force of chemical erosion is much greater than that required in a river
 saadharantaya shuddh jal shailon ko apgharshit nahin kar saktaa, kintu jab usamen baaluu or bajri mili ho to sthiti badal jaati he, kyonki ve donon ek duusare ko sambalit karte hai
 The water of the river imparts strength and the sand and gravels are abrasive, due to which the folds and the sides become smaller
 saath hi ve swayan bhi tah ke shailon ko apgharshit karne main bhaag lete hai
 The river's abrasive power is dependent on the intensity of the ghara and the intensity of the torrent is based on the topography
 dhaal jitani hi pravan hoti he, dhar bhi usee ke anusaar teevr hoti he
 Also, the amount of water also affects the speed of the torrent
 jal kii maatra ke saath dhar kii gati uske ghanmul ke anupaat se badhati he, arthath yadi jal kii maatra aathguni ho jaay, to dhar kii teji duguni ho jaati he
 As a result, in countries where the dry and rainy seasons are different, the erosion power of rivers increases greatly during the rainy days
 aarambh main, visheshkar kathor chattaanon ke pradesh main, nadi ke tat praaia: ekadam khadey or prapaati hote hai
 But due to atmospheric factors, the upper parts of the edges start degenerating
 isse utpann apaghatit or khandit padaarth nadi baha le jaati he
 As a result, the passage of the river valley becomes shaped over time, that is, both its sides become sloping towards the bottom
 nadi unche sthaan se bahakar samudr kii ore jaati he, at: uskaa praytn sadaiv yahi hota he ki vah thal bhaag ko katkar itnaa nicha kar de ki vah samudratal ke baraabar ho jaay
 In this way, the slope of the longitudinal passage from the top of the river to the confluence is highest towards the top and lowest near the confluence
 duusare shabdon main, nadi kaa udhrvadhar kataav ghati ke upree bhaagon main sabase adhik hota he or samudr kii ore badhane par kam hota jaataa he
 When the valley of the rivers reaches such a position that the vertical erosion stops and its valley floor becomes like the sea level, it reaches the peak level of erosion
 vah ghati, jisamen udhrvadhar kataav tivrata se pragatisheel ho, tarun kehalaati he, jo charamastar par pahunch chuki ho use vruddh evam inaki antasth avasthaa ko praudh kehete hai
 All three phases may exist in different parts of the same valley
 yadi kisi vruddh sarita kii ghati ke pradesh main vivenic shaktiyon ke prabhaav se sthalakritik parivartan ho jaae tathaa sthal vaishamy pun: utpann ho jaae to nadi kaa punaryukt ho jaataa he or vah ek baar phir udhrvadhar kataai aarambh kar detii he
 Generally, the slope of the river valley is gradual, though the slope may vary from place to place
 kintu kabhi kabhi pravannta akramik bhi ho jaati he or jal prapaat ban jate hai
 This situation especially occurs in regions where hard and soft rocks are interchanged
 mridu jal sugamawa se aparadit hokar bah jaataa he, jisase vahaan ghati ke utkeernan adhik maatra main ho jaataa he
 The rigid level is obstructive and remains where it stands
 pani uske upar se bahata hua ghati ke mridu staravaale adhik utkeern bhaag main girane lagata he
 In this way, the slope of the valley becomes obsolete and waterfalls are formed
 bahudhaa kalantar main in prapaton kaa sthaan bhi kramash: nadi ke sheersh kii ore hatataa jaataa he
 It happens that due to the fall of water from the height of the falls, the river's edge accelerates, which increases its erosion power
 prapaat ke thik neeche ek prakaar kaa dah ban jaataa he, jisamen bhanvar padane lagate hai tathaa unamem tivrata se ghumta hua pani prapaat kii diwaar ko kaatane lagata he
 In this way, the lower soil level is cut more rapidly and a type of amputation starts, causing the stern layer to come out without any delay
 kalantar main talochhedan ke or bad jane par, kathor str kaa sabase agrim bhaag ablamb ke abhaav main tuutakar gir padataa he or prapaat kaa sthaan gire hue shail kii naap ke baraabar peeche hat jaataa he
 This action keeps on happening again and again and again the position of the falls falls back and forth
 is prakaar ke apradan ke kaaran kadi chattan ke tuutane se, prapaat ke praarambhik sthaan se peeche kii ore ek gahari dhati banati chali jaati he
 The valley engraved in the shale of the confluence of the Narmada River at Jabalpur and the waterfall of Bhedaghat is a beautiful example of this incident
 vishwavikhyath nyagara nadi kaa prapaat isi prakaar bana he
 From the measurements made there, it is known that the falls often retreat one and a half meters from their place every year
 anumaanath: isi gati se praaia: 11 kilometre lambii nyagara kii ghati ko banane main 20 se 35 hajaar varsh tak lage honge
 In many other situations, waterfalls can be formed, but at every stage it is necessary to vary the speed of erosion of different components of the valley
 ye jalprapaat ghati kii tarun avasthaa ke uplakshak hote hai
 Upon reaching the peak level of erosion, the power of the river is used to cut its back
 jab ghati ekadam sidhi ho, to donon pashrv ek se katate hai, kintu thodi bhi vakrata aa jane se asamanta utpann ho jaati he
 Towards the concave side of the valley there is a greater intensity in the edge and hence there is a greater amount of erosion
 isliye vipareet uttal pashrv kii ore dhar kaa veg kam ho jane se, na keval kataav band ho jaataa he balki nadi dwaara vishmata or bad jaati he or nadi kaa maarg adhikadhik vakr hota jaataa he
 This is how the twisty bend originates
 bahudhaa in modon kaa aayam atyadhik bad jaataa he or mode bhi bahut jatil ho jate hai
 Sometimes two turns are so close to each other that the distance between them is less than the tithe or even less the distance of the river's transverse route
 aisi avasthaa main kabhi kabhi do modon ke bich sankeern greeva ko katkar, sidhe maarg se bahane lagati he or ek yaa adhik visarpi mode parityakt ho jate hai, jinhen chhaadan kehete hai
 The transport function of the river is often more effective than all the natural factors
 nijee apradan se utpann jo shail churna, bajri, baaluu or mitti utpann hoti he, vah sab nadi bahaakar samudr kii ore le jaati he, saath hi vayumandaleey karkon, vishesh kar varsha jal dwaara utpann shail churna tathaa khand bhi, kalantar main kisi na kisi maarg se nadi kii ghati main pahunch jate hai or uski dhar main pakadakar ve sab samudr kii ore dhire dhire aage badhate jate hai
 The larger blocks, which are unable to lift the river, move in transverse folding of the fold and the small particles move suspended suspended
 parivahan kii shakti dhar kii gati par nirbhar he
 If the amount of increase in speed is more, then the transport power will become 6 more
 arthath yadi gati badhkar dugani ho jaay, to parivahan shakti 64 guni ho jaaegi
 It is clear from this that during the rainy floods the transport power of the rivers as well as the amount of destruction power becomes very terrible
 ganga, brahaputra ityadi badi nadiyon ke tatavarti nivasee is vinaashkari shakti se bhali bhaanti parichit hai
 Apart from suspended sand and soil, many rivers dissolve in their water and lead them from the continental parts to the sea
 jaisaa varsha jal or aantbhom jal ke prakarnon main bataaya ja chukaa hen, unki rasinic kriya prachur pariman main hoti hai, jisase viley padaarth bhi usee anupaat main banataa hai
 All these substances eventually reach the rivers
 nadiyaan swayan bhi apni kriya se kuch viley padaarth utpann karti hai or yah sab kramash: samudr main pahunch jaataa hai
 By calculation, it is estimated that the Ganges and the Brahmaputra often transport 1100 n 106 cubic meters of soil and sand per year to the Bay of Bengal through its combined route, the amount of material transported by the Mississippi River of America per year is 200 n 106 cubic meters
 china kii hwangaho nadi itane vishaal pariman main mitti le jaati hai ki uske muhane ke paas kaa samudr milon dur tak pilaa bana rahata hai or isi se vah pit sagar kehalaata hai
 In South America, the delta which has become a land of land in the sea floor in front of the mouth of Baha'i soil and sand by the Amazon river is about 200 kilometers long
 anumaanath:, vishwa kii samast nadiyon dwaara prati varsh parivahit padaarth kii maatra 16 ghan kilometre aanki gai hai
 As mentioned in the preceding section, the transport power of a river depends on the speed of its torrent
 at: jyonhi uski dhar kii gati main hs hota he, uski lad kaa kuch ansh turant nickshepit hone lagata he
 The first important deposition center in the path of the river is at the place at the bottom of the mountain where it leaves the Parvatya region and enters the plain
 kaaphi bade bade golashyam or choti badi batiyaan, jo ghati main parvaty bhaag main sugamawa se ludhakti hui chali aati he, nadi ke maidan main pravesh karte hi tal main baith jaati hai
 In this way a deposit is formed at the bottom of the mountains, which is called alluvial cone, or fan
 doosraa mahatvapurn gati parivartan kaa sthaan nadi ke sangam ke sameep hota he
 One, the slope of the valley gets very low as it reaches there, the other sea and lake water also stops the flow
 bahudhaa dhar kaa veg itnaa kam ho jaataa he ki jowar kaa veg nadi ke veg se adhik hota he, jise jowar ke samay nadi kii dhar ulti bahane lagati hai
 The result of this is that the river near the confluence begins to deposit sediments and sediments with great intensity and fill its own valley
 avsaad ke jamaa hone se nadi kaa bahna or bhi kathin ho jaataa he or nadi cat katkar kai choti dhaaraon main vibhakt ho jaati he
 In the course of this deposited depression, a flat plain is formed, out of which many small streams flow at a very slow speed towards the sea
 yah maidan tribhujaakar hota he, jiskaa ek sheersh nadi kii ghati ke us sthaan par hota he jahaan se dhara kaa vibhaajan armbh hota he or uske saamne vaali aadhaar rekha samudr ke tat ke anuprastha hoti he
 This type of region is called delta
 nadi ke sangam par gati ke avaruddha hone se bahudhaa baaluu dirdhakaar raashiyon main nickshepit ho jaataa he, jise balukabhithti, athwa rodhika kehete hai
 The river in the area between the alluvial cone and the delta is often affected by seasonal floods and fluctuations
 baadh ke samay nadi main itnaa pani aa jaataa he jo uski ghati main nahin samaa saktaa
 As a result, it spreads far beyond the two sides
 jo pradesh is prakaar baadh ke prabhaav main aa jaataa he, use baadh maidan kehete hai
 In that part the speed of the river edge is much less than the main stream, due to which there is abundant soil and sand deposits
 iske vipareet baadh ke samay mukhya dhar kii gati saadhaaran samay kii gati se bahut adhik hoti he, isaliye vahaan apradan bad jaataa he or nadi pehle jamaa kii hui baaluu or mitti ko katkar le jaati he
 As mentioned earlier, the effort of the river is to deepen its valley, to reach the peak of erosion
 ghati kii gaharaai bad jane par bahudhaa aisi sthiti aa jaati he ki barh ke samay bhi pehle vaali baadh ke maidan tak na pahunchne paae
 In such a situation, the river creates a new floodplain
 puranavala baadh-maidan nadi vedika kehalaata he
 Often in the valleys of the river, such altars are visible on both sides, or on the same side, well above the innovative level
 kahin kahin to 2-3 yaa or bhi adhik vedicen kramash: ek duusari ke upar vibhinn talon par milti hai
 The history of the development of the river valley can be known from his studies
 unche parvatiy bhaagon or sheetapradhan deshon main thande mausam main jal ke badale him varsha hoti he
 Areas where snow-rainfall is more than the amount of snow melt during summer time are always snowed
 jis oonchaai par aisa hota he, use him rekha kehete he
 This elevation varies in different latitudes and regions, such as in the Himalayas, it usually ranges from 4,500 to 5,500 meters, the Alps Mountains 2,400 meters, and Norway only 1,500 meters
 dhruvon ke paas, vishesh kar dakshini dhruv par to samudr kaa bahut bada bhaag sadaiv himachhadit rahata he
 When coming from the sky, snow is as soft as cotton wool's cheeks
 vastut: usamen prachur maatra main vaayu mili hoti he
 When a large amount is collected, the pressure from the upper levels escapes into the lower levels and the snowflakes converge to form hard ice
 bahut vishaal pariman main ekatrit hone par gurutvakarshan ke prabhaav se, anukool sthalakritti pradeshon main barf kii raashi dhire dhire neeche kii ore khisakane lagati he or is prakaar ek nadi si ban jaati he, jise himandi kehete hai
 Later, like a river, she also builds a valley for herself
 jise vah shanai: shanai: adhikadhik gaharaa karti jaati he
 Being engraved with solid ice, glacial valleys have certain characteristics, three of which are prominent: unka nital chaudaa or kinare prapaati hote hai, jisase unka udhrv pariched chha aakaar kaa hota he, Their valleys do not spiral but go very straight for a long time and mukhya himandi or sahaayak himandi ke sangam ke sthaan par donon ghaatiyon kaa tal kramik na hokar prapaati hota he
 Due to this the valley of tributaries is called Nilambi valley
 thos hone kaaran himandi kii gati bahut kam hoti he
 At some places, only 30 centimeters move throughout the day
 kabhi kabhi veg apekshaakrit adhik bhi hota he
 Some glaciers in Alaska often rise two and a half meters in a day
 yah gati, nadi kii gati ke samaan hi, barf kii maatra or pradeshik dhaal kii pravanta par nirbhar hoti he
 On reaching the bottom of the ice line, the ice begins to melt and takes the form of an ordinary river
 himalay se aane vaali praaia: samast nadiyon ke jal kaa mul strot yah pighalati hui himandiyaan hi hai
 In regions where the snow line is often equal to the sea level, glaciers themselves fall into the sea
 aise sangamon par bahudhaa barf kii badi badi rashiyaan peeche se aanevaali barf ke dabaav se mul nadi se tuutakar pruthak ho samudr main pravaahit ho jaati he or behate behate kaaphi dur nikal jaati hai
 These zodiac signs are called the Plowy iceberg
 plavi himshail anya kaarnon se bhi ban sakate hai
 In very cold regions, sometimes it happens that glaciers retain their form even when they are near the sea, and by carving the sea level near the coast, they continue to advance their valley far and wide
 norway or sweden main is prakaar se bani ghaatiyon ke bahut udhaaharan hai evam unhen fiard kehete hai
 Like the river, the glacier also transports rocks undamaged and broken from them
 kintu donon kii kriya vidhi main bahut antar he
 Where many small and big obstacles move at the bottom of the river by rolling at the speed of the edge, there is no opportunity for them to roll in the glacier
 jo tukdaa jis dasha main barf main fas jaataa he usee avasthaa main aage badhata he
 Many pieces of rock fall here and fall on the glacier
 jyon jyon himdhar aage badhati he, ye khand bhi jyon ke tyon pade hue aage badhate hai
 As a result of this variation, where the stones transported by the river become chubby form after some time rolling and colliding with each other, the sections carried by the snowfall remain angular and pointed until the end
 iske atirikt dhar kii sahaayta se nadi apane parivahit padaarth ko aakaar or ghanatv ke aadhaar par pruthak pruthak bhaagon main vibhakt kar detii he, yatha tej dhar kii jagahon par keval moti bajri, usase kam tej dhar main moti baaluu evam gati ke kramash: or kam hone par maheen baaluu or mitti baari baari se ghati kii tah main jamaa hoti he
 In contrast, glacial material cannot be sorted in this way, but its loading consists of large ballasts, fine sand and clay, blocks of different sizes, all moving together in unison
 or jahaan himandi kaa pighalanaa armbh hota he uskaa sabakaa sab bina kisi vibhaajan ke ek saath nickshepit ho jaataa he
 The power of transport of matter in the glacier is unlimited
 shilaon ke bade khandon ko bhi himdhar usee sugamawa se parivahit kar sakati he jisase ki chote kanon ko
 Thus, where a large amount of water separated by mere rock in a river valley cannot go further apart without broken into small blocks, they continue to move in the glacial valley
 himandi kaa jahaan ant hota he or barf pighalati he, vahiin ye bade bade khand gir padate hai
 They have no maternal connection to the local territorial rocks, hence they are called displaced blocks
 himandi se dharaatal par girte samay jis pahal par bhi ye tik jaayan, usee par tike hue anek kaal tak khadey rah jate hai
 Sometimes they fall on only a small corner and stand on the same
 aisi sthiti main inkaa santulan bada sthir sa dikhaai padataa he or inhen du:sthit khand kehete hai
 The snow-clad sections near the base of the valley scratch the folding stones from their pointed corners
 barf ke dabaav or shilaon kii kathorta ke anusaar, ye kharonchen kam yaa adhik gahari hoti hai
 Sometimes many small small blocks pass close by
 un sabaki ragad se ek hi shila main anek kharonchen ban jaati hai
 The rubbing of these blocks takes place in the direction of glacial flow, so all the scratches are parallel to each other
 is prakaar kharonchi hui shilaon ko rekhanvit kehate hai
 In contrast to this, it is sometimes the case that a rock, trapped near the glacier in the glacier, moves forward by rubbing through the hard rocks of the valley folds, so that its top edge is smooth and fruitful and the other end is angular
 And fangs are left
 is prakaar himandiranjit pahaldaar khand banate hai
 Sometimes the mounds of rocks located in the glacial valley become very smooth due to the abrasion of snow and their western corner falls
 adhikansh chikanahat tile ke us bhaag main hoti he jo dhar kii vipareet disha main hota hai, kyonki barf aage kii ore ragad detii hui badhati hai
 In the case of Bhagaparvsh, it is left as it is, retail and edgy
 is prakaar ke tilo ko raash muhane kehete hen
 Mostly, the glacial rocks carry sections of the rock on their top floor
 ghati ke kagaaron kii chattaanon tushaar aadi ke prabhaavavash samay par tuutati rahati hai, jisase shailakhand evam churna himandi ke upar uske kinaaron ke paas girte rahete hai or is tarah himandi ke donon kinaaron par parivahit padaarth ko pashrv moren kehete hai
 Initially over the central part of the glacier, rocks are usually not present at all, because that part is away from the edges of the valley
 par do him-nadiyon kaa sangam hone par ek ke dahni ore tathaa duusari ke bai ore ke more na paraspar mil jate hai or sangam ke aage se madhya moren ban jaataa he
 Finally, where glaciers cease and water is formed by the melting of ice, all the material brought to and between the ice surface collapses
 ise agrantasth moren kehete hai
 There is an absolute lack of stratification
 yadi jalwaayu main parivartan, yaa kisi or kaaran se himandi apni pehali seemaa se agragami hone lage, to barf pehle bane hue agrantasth moren kii samast raashi ko aage dhakelti hui chalegi
 Conversely, if the glacier moves towards the top, one layer of the frontal moraine will be formed backwards
 dharaatal ke teen chauthai bhaag par aadhipatty hote hue bhi samudr apana vistaar badhaane ke liye nirantar prayatnsheel rahata he
 Apparently his field of work is the neutral region, where he tries to make the continent flattened equal to its surface, dislodging the rocks by its strong waves, destroying the bumpy roughness of the land
 yon to shant mausam main bhi lehren baar baar chattaanon se takaraakar unhen aghat pahunchaati hai, par tufaan ke samay to unki shakti sahastron guna adhik ho jaati he
 The waves of large storms often rise 14–15 m high
 unke dwaara phenkaa hua phen, bajri or chote rode 40-50 meter unche uchhalte hue dekhe gaye hai
 Each wave strikes the coast with the weight of all its water, and it seems as if nature is beating the neutral region with a very large cube
 lehren paroksh dhang se bhi apni apardi kriya main sahaayta leti hen
 All rocks have fine cracks and small holes
 jab lehren jor se aakar achaanak chattaanon se takaraati hai, tab in daraaron or chhidron main bhari hui hawa ko baahar nikalne kaa avasar nahin mil paata or vah jahaan kii tahaan dabakar sankuchit ho jaati he
 At the time of the return of the waves, the air expands again when the water pressure is removed
 yah kriya itani shidhrata se hoti he ki achaanak faili hui hawa ko baahar nikalne kaa maarg bhi nahin mil paata or vah ek prakaar se visphotak shakti kaa kaary karti he
 By repeating the action repeatedly, the cracks around the crevices and holes start to break and the holes become larger respectively
 kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki daraaren samudr or mahadesh donon kii ore khuli hoti hai
 In such a state, when the pressure is exerted by the waves, the crack air escapes rapidly towards the ground and upon return of the waves, it enters the crack again as fast
 baar baar aisa hone se maheen chhidr bade hote jate hai or kramash: surangen ban jaati hai, jinhen fadhamichhidraf kehete hai
 In this way, the neutral rocks gradually begin to rise at the height of the waves, which makes the longitudinal rock of the upper rocks also weakened and they also collapse
 gurutvakarshan bhi is kriya main bahut kuch bhaag letaa he
 Where there are many types of rocks, some weak and some hard, there are more facilities for the waves, virtually any natural agent to do its work; Because when the weakened rock is cut, the base of the hard rock in contact with it also becomes weak and its personal hardness decreases
 laharon ke prabhaavavash chattaanon ke tuutane se vividh aakaar ke tukdon ko to lehren teji se ludhakaakar chattaanon par de maarthi hai, jisase ve swayan bhi tuutakar chote tathaa golmatol ho jate hai
 This increases the power to hit the sea even more
 kalantar main tukade bajri main parivartit ho jate hai
 After that, the waves do not let them rest for a moment, constantly moving back and forth with them
 falat: kuch samay baad bajri ke tukade bahut maheen or ekadam golakaar ho jate hai, kabhi kabhi itane chote ki tah main baith bhi nahin pate or pani main latake rah jate hai
 In this way the force of the particles to be small and galloping is far greater than that of the river, because the speed of rubbing in the bottom of the river is only in one direction, towards the flow of the river, the other is in the lower part of the river valley
 When the edge is reduced, large particles remain as they are, and thus their action of progressively smaller stops
 jowarbhata or anya prakaar se utpann hui samudri dharaayen bhi laharon ke kaam main sahyog detii hai
 They have a particularly notable effect in the narrow valleys of rivers near the confluence, where strong currents arise due to tides, which attempt to decay the sandy ridges and submerged rocks in the water
 ye dharaayen mitti or baaluu ko nadi ke muhane tathaa samast samudratat ke paas se bich samudr kii ore bahut dur tak baha le jaati hai
 The impact of the impact of waves is not limited to the land above the surface of the water, but also to the bottom of the shallow parts of the sea
 anubhav se maaloom hota he ki praaia: 30 meter kii gaharaai tak unki kshay karne kii shakti kaaryshil rahati he
 The work of waves below the surface is often the same as that of cutting out the growing grass, that is to say, the waves try to create a flat spot by removing the disparity in the height of the rocks submerged in the sea by their shock
 
 sthaan sthaan par samudr kii gaharaai naapane se maaloom hota he ki samast bhubhag ke chaaron ore praaia: 30 meter kii gaharaai par ek chauras maidan sa he
 This plain is called the sea cover
 samudr or jhiilon ke prakritik gunon main keval aakaar kaa hi antar he
 The sea is a very small reservoir, where there is a very large and bottomless reservoir
 isi se jhil main uthi tarangon kaa veg evam jowarbhate kaa pariman samudr kii apeksha ati laghu hota he
 As a result, the erosive action of the lake towards the earth is often similar to that of the sea, only its quantity becomes smaller according to the size of the lake
 uparyukt vivaran main vibhinn prakritik karkon kii apardi or anaachhadi kriya evam usase utpann avsaad ityadi ke parivahan kaa vrut bataaya gaya he
 It is worth noting here that the scope of each factor is unique

 For example, the decomposed material produced by the action of rainwater reaches the river through small streams and drains and then the river carries it to the sea or lake
 is prakaar tushaar dwaara utpann shailakhand gurutvakarshan ke prabhaav se pahari ke tal main pahonchte hai or phir jab tak vah kisi anya kaarak ke prabhaav main na aa jaayan, vahiin sanchit pade rahete hai
 The glacier carries the depression created by its action to its melting point
 vahaan uskaa prabhavakshetra samaapt ho jaataa he or phir vah avsaad nadi ke prabhaav main aa jaataa he
 The lowest place of Bhuprishta is the sea
 at: shailon ke apradan or apghaton se utpann avsaad kaa antim thikaana samudr hi he
 Due to the state of matter, it may be that this substance stops moving for some time at some place on the road; Nevertheless, late in the morning, sometimes at a slow pace, sometimes at a fast pace, he keeps traveling towards the sea
 avsaad ko samudr tak pahunchne kaa sabase adhik bhaar nadi ke upar he
 It has been mentioned earlier that the river has the power to classify its transported material into gravel, sand, soil etc
 on the basis of its size
 at: adhikansh avsaad motaa, madhyam or maheen teen virgon main vibhakt ho jaataa he, jo kramash: tat se adhikadhik duuri par jaakar nickshepit hote hai, arthath ek hi str ke tat ke nikatwale bhaag main kan bade or duuravaale bhaag main maheen or chote honge
 At any one place as the depression accumulates in greater quantity, the water there will also be relatively shallow and consequently the velocity of the torrent will also increase slightly
 at: samast avsaad pehle kii apeksha kuch duuri par jaakar avakshepit hoga or prayek sthaan par sanchit avsaad kuch motaa ho jayega, yatha chote kankadon tathaa bajri ke upar moti baaluu, moti ke upar maheen baaluu or maheen baaluu ke upar mitti jamaa hogi
 After some time, due to accumulation of more depression, the entire area will become more shallow again and then the deposition of depression will again reach one step further
 yadi kisi kaaran uparyukt nickshepan centre main samudr kii tah dhire dhire khiskkar nichi hone lage or khisakane kii gati avsaad ke sanchit hone kii gati ke baraabar ho to adhikadhik avsaad ke sanchit hone ke baad bhi samudr kii antat: gaharaai jyon kii tyon bani rahegi or prayek sthaan par ek hi aakaar ke kanon kaa nickshepan chirkaal tak aviraam hota rahegaa
 Another condition can also occur when the speed of sliding of the bottom of the sea exceeds the speed of accumulation of depression
 us avasthaa main prabhaav ulta hoga or avsaad ke sanchit hone par bhi samudr adhikadhik gaharaa hota jayega
 As a result, the location of deposition of particles of different sizes will progressively move towards each step
 uparyukt pehali or teesri sthitiyon main vibhinn aakaar kii raashiyon kaa ekantaran hota he or duusari sthiti main samaan aakaar kaa avsaad moti moti raashiyon main sanchit ho jaataa he
 The amount of sedimentation brought by most rivers is very low in rainfall seasons
 at: varshakaal main avsaad bahut prachur maatra main samudr main nickshepit hota he
 Often the amount of depression accumulated in the period between two successive rainfall seasons is negligible
 aisi sthiti main avsaad sanchayan ruuk rukkar hota he or ek varsha ritu main aae hue avsaad ko duusari ritu ke avsaad ke aane ke purv kuch kadaa hone tathaa dab jane kaa avasar mil jaataa he
 Overloading water helps suppress depression
 falat: uttarottar varsha rituon main aae hue avsaad pehle aae hue avsaadon se ekadam mishrit nahin hote, apitu pruthak pruthak starikaon main sanchit hote hai
 This action is called leveling
 pratyek starika kii motaai ek varsha ritu main aae hue avsaad kii maatra par nirbhar hogi
 On average it ranges from 2 to 4 millimeters
 yadi avsaad kaa nickshepan kai varshon tak satat hota rahe, to spashtatya patali patali starikaon main sthaan par kuch mote staron main avsaad sanchit hoga or in staron kii motaai avsaad aane kii gati evam us avadhi par nirbhar hogi jisamen avsaad kaa nickshepan aviraam hota rahe
 levels 
 maheen mitti or maheen baaluu ke kan jal main bahut der tak nilambit rahete hai or bahut hi shanai: shanai: tah main baithte hai
 Their deposition also occurs in relatively deep water, where the edge is completely relaxed
 aisi avasthaa main kanon ke sanchit hone kii vyavastha nirantar ek si bani rahati he or str suvyavasthti or niyamit banate hai
 The particles get enough time to freeze and the levels continue to be parallel to the sea
 iske vipareet moti baaluu or bajri ityadi ke sanchit hone kaa sthaan apekshaakrit chhichhlaa hota he
 In such places the speed of the torrent is often variable, sometimes slow and sometimes rapid
 mand avasthaa main sanchit avsaad kaa upree bhaag, teevr gati kii avasthaa main aparidit hokar bahane lagata he or jahaan dhar mand ho vahaan pun: nickshepan ho jaataa he
 Thus the deposited material is not parallel to the first layer
 iske atirikt chhichley pani main, jahaan in mote kanon kaa nickshepan hota he, bahudhaa dhar kii disha bhi badalati rahati he
 This change happens due to tides and strong wind etc
 at: dhar kii disha ke saath saath avsaadeey staron kii disha bhi sthaniyat: badalati rahati he
 Thus the levels of sedimentary rocks accumulated in shallow water are often not parallel to each other, whose angles may vary from place to place
 is ghatana ko abhaasi sanstaran kehete hai
 Sometimes there is a situation in depression areas that the imprint of water waves also gets printed in the depressive levels
 chhichley pradeshon main, vishashakar jowarbhatantar katibandh main, tarangon kaa veg itnaa adhik haata he ki vahaan nickshepit baaluu or mitti unke sanketon par naachati phirti hai or bahudhaa unhen bhi tarang rup de detii hai
 Before the arrival of new depression, if this ripple sand gets an opportunity to dry up and get some strength, then this wave form remains safe
 bhaate kii avasthaa main avsaad ko sookhne evam ddadh ho jane kaa avasar bahudhaa mil jaataa he
 Similarly, the footprints of crabs, insects, and other animals can also be protected in the depression accumulated in the tidal zone
 kabhi kabhi varshajal kii boondon se bane aghatchinh bhi in avsaadon main surakshit ho jate hai
 After the death of various types of flaky animals living in the sea, their scales start accumulating in the sea
 tarangon ke pravaah se bahudhaa ye shalk idhar udhar ludhakte rahete hai, jisase kalantar main ve tuutakar chur ho jate hai or nadi dwaara laai hui baaluu or mitti main mil jate hai
 Most of the flakes are made of calcium carbonate and thus calcium solids, sand and clay are formed
 shuddh mitti, athwa baaluu, ke str keval unheen sthanon main sanchit ho pate hai jahaan shalkadhari jeev praaia: anupasthit hon
 Sometimes the flakes are buried in depression before they break down and in that state they become safe as they are
 is prakaar surakshit shalkon ko jeevashm kehete hai
 In the deepest parts of the sea, where the sand and mud depressions brought by the river do not reach, a pure depression of the powder of shields is deposited, the amount of which can become very abundant over time
 is prakaar baaluu ke str chhichley pani main, mitti ke str apekshaakrit kuch gahare pani main or chooneydaar avsaad ke shail adhik gahare samudri bhaagon main sanchit hote hai
 In arid and temperate countries, watering occurs in abundance

 Generally, some salts dissolve in the water and rainwater of the rivers
 at: jhil main nadiyon dwaara nity prati nayaa lavan padaarth aata rahata he
 The water evaporates due to the heat, but the salt is left behind
 at: jhil kaa pani uttarottar adhik lavniya athwa khaaraa hota jaataa he
 Over time, the salt may accumulate in such a large amount that the lake water becomes saturated with it
 isse adhik vaashpan se lavan avakshipt hone lagegaa, jisase avsaad lavniya ho jayega
 If the amount of sediment brought by rivers at the time of precipitation of salt is very low, pure salt levels can usually precipitate
 tibet kii anekon jhilein is kriya kii udhaaharan hai
 There is very little rainfall, due to which the lakes are getting progressively drier and the saline levels are precipitating in their layers
 pakistan ke sault ranj parvat main, khevda ke pradesh main sandha namak tathaa jipsom ke nikshep isi prakaar kisi pracheen sagar kii shakha ke sookhne se bane honge
 Similarly, due to the action of various natural agents, the erosion and erosion of the geomorphic rocks is being sustained and the depression arising from it is finally accumulating in the trough of the sea
 jyon jyon avsaad ke staron main vruddhi hoti he, nichevale staron ke upar nae aae hue padaarth kii daab badhati jaati he
 Often the pressure of sedimentary levels of 300 m thick is 80 kg per square centimeter
 at: keval 60 meter mute staron ke sanchit hone par, sabase neeche ke staron par praaia: 13 kilogram prati varg centimetre kii daab padane lagegi
 The water pressure of the reservoir is also not reduced
 prati ek meter pani kii daab 100 gram prati varg centimetre hoti he
 Due to the effect of all these pressures, the properties of depression come close together and intertwine with each other
 inke bich kaa pani nikal jaataa he or ve shushkpraay ho jate hai
 Thin, thin membranes of water can still stick to the particles and their stress helps to keep the particles interconnected
 jalaashyon athwa aantarbhom jal main saadharantaya kuch na kuch lavan villin hote hai1 jab yah jal risataa hua avsaad main se bahata he, to kuch vibhinn kaarnon se isamen kaa kuch lavan avsaad ke kanon ke bich main avakshepit hokar, uske mukt kanon ko aapas main ddadh rup se sanyojit kar detaa he or avsaad kathor, subaddh pashaan main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Calcium carbonate, iron oxide, and silica are particularly notable among the salts used in combination
 inamen se silica kaa bandhan sabase suddadh hota he
 The type of stone formed in this way will depend on the substance of depression
 yatha baaluu ke avsaad se bana shail athwa shell, batiyon ke samooh ke sangyojan se sangutikashm ityadi banenge
 If there is a little sand in the soil, sandy rocks etc
 will form
 samudr vaa anya jalaashyon main avsaad staron athwa pararto main shanai: shanai: sanchit hota he
 The particles of depression are compressed due to their compression due to pressure and with the help of some salts and other bases
 is kriya main bhi avsaad kaa starabhav bana rahata he
 Due to depression, they are also called sedimentary rocks
 avsaadeey shail padaarth samudr athwa anya jalaashyon kii tah main bahut kaal tak sanchit hota rahata he
 In due course of time, due to the effect of a circle etc
, it can rise from the bottom of the ocean, take the form of a mountain and become part of the continent
 yah ek pralayakari parivartan hota he
 This causes the sedimentary material to form the backdrop of the action of the natural agents and, under their influence, decaying again gives rise to new depressions, which begin to deposit at the bottom of the then ocean

 At the end of each cycle, the ocean and continents are reestablished and new land and water bodies are formed in them

 Samoa, ie the tribal Bhil, officially the independent Samoa state, IPA: / səˈmoʊə / was formerly known as Western Samoa and German Samoa, a governed country in the western part of the island of Samoa in the southern Pacific Ocean
 yah newjiland se 1962 main swatantra hua
 The two main islands of Samoa are Upolu and Sawai'i, one of the largest islands in Polynesia
 rajdhani shahar epia or falaolo antarrashtriya hawaii adda upolu ke dweep par sthit hai
 On 15 December 1976, Samoa was incorporated into the United Nations

 2500 and 1500 BC Samoans originated from Austronesian ancestors during the period of Lapita expansion from southeastern and Melanesia to the east

 Intimate socio-cultural and genetic linkages existed between the eastern Lapita settlements and archaeological records support oral tradition and native genealogies, indicating inter-island seafaring and intermarriage between prehistoric Samoans, Fijians, and Tongans
 18veen sadi ke aarambh main europiyon ke saath sampark shuru hua
 Jakob Roggeveen, a Hollander, was the first known European to see the Samoan islands in 1722

 Mission work in Samoa began in the late 1830s by John Williams of the London Missionary Society, who came to Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti
 By that time, the image of the Samoans had become barbaric and warlike, as there were violent clashes between local residents and French, British, German and American forces
 By the end of the nineteenth century these forces considered Samoa a refueling station for coal-fired ships and suitable for whale hunting
 vishesh rup se german ne samoai dwipon par badi vyavsaayik dilchaspee dikhaani shuru kii, khaskar upolu dweep par jahaan german companiyon ne kopra or cocao fali ke prasanskaran par ekadhikaar jamaa rakhaa tha; sanyukt rajya america ne apane daawey pesh kiye or bahut hi spasht rup se tutuila or manu'aa dwipon ke sthaneey deshi saradaaron ke saath ek gathbandhan bana liya
 Britain also sent forces to protect British trade enterprises, port rights and the consulate office
 After this there was a civil war for eight years, in which each of the three powers supplied arms, training and in some cases even combat troops to the warring Samoan parties
 The trio sent warships to the port of Appia and a large-scale war seemed inevitable, but a heavy storm damaged or destroyed the warships, ending the military conflict
 beesvin sadi ke aarambh main, tripaksheeya sammelan ne samoai dwipon ko do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya: purvi dweep samooh sanyukt rajya america kaa ek kshetra ban gaya or ab ise america samoa ke rup main janaa jaataa he; jab britain ne samoa se apane saare daawey waapas le liye or tonga tathaa solomon dwipon ke kuch kshetron or pashchim africa se german adhikaron kii samaapti ko sweekaar kar liya gaya tab jameen kaa kahin bada hissaa pashchimi dweep samooh german samoa ke naam se janaa jane laga
 The first German governor was Wilhelm Solf, who later went on to become secretary for the colonies of Imperial Germany

 In 1912, a change occurred that the German administration apparently achieved its long-term goal of aligning with traditional powers in Samoa politics by upholding the uniformity of local participation in government
 tupu yaa yahaan tak ki alli sili naamak padavi nahin rahi, balki unke sthaan par do fautua niyukt kiye gayi
 Tumua and Pulay were silent for a time; All decisions on matters affecting land and title were under the control of the Governor
 prakriya ko puraa karne ke liye, saare samoa ke liye pha'alupega ko sanshodhit kiya gaya tha
 From the end of the 19th century at least, Fa'alupéga which was accepted at the national level was as follows: "tulouna e tumua maa pule, tulouna e itu'au maa alaatua, tulouna e aiga-i-le-tai, maa le vaa'aa-o-phonoti, tulouna e tamaa maa e latou aiga po'o aiga maa e tamaa latou "
 This Fa'alupega first validates the authority and identity of the principal districts of Samua through its spokesmen - Tumua Ma Pulay, Itu'u Ma Alatau, aiga-i-lay, Ma le wa'a-o-fonoti And the highest titles that were conferred by these groups
 samoa ke mahaan adhiktam vansh samoohon or unke "beton", jinhen sarvocch oopaadhi ke liye chunaa gaya, kii pahchaan ke saath yah samaapt hua
 The new Fa'alupega of German Samoa clearly required the oaths to Malietoa Tanunafili and Tupua Tamasse, and thus the new Fa'alupega, which replaced the historical Fa'alupega of Samoa, is the following: "tulouna e laana maiesitete le kaisaa o le tupu maamlu o lo tatou maalo kasialika aoaao 
 tulouna e laana afioga le kowana kasialika o le sui o le kaisaa i samoa nei

 From the end of World War i to 1962, New Zealand controlled Samoa as a Category c mandate under trusteeship through the League of Nations

 The second major event began with a peaceful protest by Mau initially, a non-violent popular movement that began in the early 1900s on Sawai'i and was led by Lauki Namululu Mamou, a speaker who was overthrown by Solf

 Following the non-violent philosophy of Mau, the newly elected leader, the superior chief Tupua Tamasese Leelofi, led his followers in a peaceful demonstration of the uniformed Mau on 28 December 1929 in the city of Appia
 newjiland police ne pradarshan ke netaaon main se ek ko giraftaar karne kaa prayaas kiya
 When it was opposed, a struggle started between the police and Mau
 The officers began indiscriminate firing on the crowd and a Lewis machine gun designed for this demonstration was used to disperse the crowd

 According to Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School, one possible solution to net neutrality concerns could be municipal broadband
 15 may 2014 ko, effsisi ne internet sevaaon ke sambandh main do vikalpon par vichaar karne kaa nirnay liya: pehla, tej or dhimi gati se broadband len permit, jisase shuddh tatasthta se samjhauta kiya ja sake; or doosraa, ek doorsanchaar seva ke rup main broadband ko doharaaya jaataa he, jisase net tatasthta ko surakshit rakhata he
 On 10 November 2014, President Barack Obama recommended that the FCC redesign broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service to preserve net neutrality

 Class is a template used in programming languages using which new variables of this type are created
 inke nae charon ko programing sandarbhon main aksar object kehete hai
 a class can have many variables and functions
 ye char privet, protected yaa public ho sakate hai
 Another class can also be created from the mold of one class which can contain more details than the first class
 class vastutah kai variable or function kaa sangrah he
 By using the same class template, many similar variables and functions can be created
 chunki class ke prayog se isi prakaar ke object barambar banaae ja sakate hai, is programing dharna kaa prayog aisi jagahon par barbar kiya jaataa he jahaan ek saath kai variable ko define karnaa padataa he
 For example, it is convenient to use three int to represent a date - day, month and year
 atah inako ek class ke tahat paribhaashit karne se baar-baar ek hi prakaar kii paribhaasha se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Class Date {int day, month, year); Date d1, d2, d3



 isi prakaar class ke andar aisi vidhiyon ko rakhana suvidhajanak hota he jo usee class ke aankadon ke upar kaam kare
 For example, determining the day of a date, ie whether the date is Monday or Tuesday, etc
, may be an appropriate method for the above class to be defined within the class

 upar die udhaaharan main class ke andar kii paribhaasha nahin dikhaai gai he
 As an example, the definition can be as follows: uparokt code main class ke andar do int char, ek float char or ek function he jo int prakaar ke apane do charon kaa antar detaa he
 The use of class has facilitated programming written by large and multi-programmers in different parts
 isaki mukhya visheshta iskaa band-swaroop, bahurupi or vanshaantaran he - The purpose of deriving one class from another class is to further enrich the first class - and to refrain from re-doing everything in the second class that has been done in the first class
 udhaaharan-swaroop agar Date class main ek or char, saptaah kaa din jodna ho te sirf itnaa likhnaa hoga - This did not require variable define for the day, month and year in the Date2 class, as it already exists in the Date class
 iske baad Date2 class ke variable banaae or prayog kiye ja sakate hai : In programming terms, it is called polymorphism
 koi class apane dwaara banaae duusare class main ek alag rup main rah saktaa he
 In the above example, a new Class b can be created from Class a which defines subtract as follows

 audyogikaran se or vyapaar kii niyamit vruddhi se desh sona-chaandi praapt kar samrudh or shaktishaalee hoga
 This is the basic principle of commercialism
 vaanijyawad main vyapaaree varg, vyavasthit, sunishchit or niyamit vaanijya-vyapaar or sone-chaandi kii prapti or sanghathan par adhik bal diya gaya
 "get more gold and be more powerful" was the slogan of commercialism
 adhik dhan sangrah se desh kii aarthik shakti or sampannataa badhati he
 By this, political goals can be easily achieved
 aantarik shaanti or bahya akramanon se suraksha praapt ho sakati he, isliye shaasha, raajnneetijna, vichaarak, arthshaastri, prashaasak or vyapaaree varg ne vaanijyawad kaa samarthan kiya
 Accumulation of Gold and Silver - Trade-commerce will increase wealth and this wealth should be collected in the form of gold, silver, diamonds, gems and precious gems
 ye sab na to nashwan hai or na parivartansheel
 They remain abundant wealth at all times and on every occasion
 swarna, chaandi or ratnon ke bhandar rajshakti ke pratik hai
 With this increasing wealth, internal peace and external security can be obtained in the country by obtaining war material
 is prakaar vaanijyawad surakshatmak he
 International trade - International trade is the basis of commercialism
 desh main audyogikaran kar desh ke badhate hue utpaadan kii vastuon kaa anya deshon ko niryaat karnaa
 If necessary, some specific industries of the state should be protected and foreign trade should be encouraged
 antarrajjiy vyapaar se dhan prapti yudhon main vijay kaa aadhaar he
 Favorable and balanced trade - To get enough money in trade, sell a large amount of merchandise to foreign countries, but get minimum quantity of goods from abroad to your country
 iskaa arth yah he ki desh nunatam aayaat karen or adhiktam niryaat kare
 With this, the country will get precious metals - gold and silver - to export, and with minimal imports, very little money will have to be sent out to foreign countries
 is siddhant ko anukool or santulit vyapaar kehete hai
 The prices of imported goods and commodities should not exceed the prices of exported goods and goods
 aayaat or niryaat main anukool santulan hona chahie
 By adopting this system, there will be more production in the country, more money will be in circulation, capitalism will be encouraged and the country will be economically strong
 audyogic pratibandh or vyapaarik niyantran - desh main udyog-vyavsaayon ko rajkeey protsaahan dekar unamem adhikadhik vruddhi karne se kahin atyaadhik utpaadan nahin ho jaae
 Excessive production leads to many losses, such as increase in unemployment, lack of lifting of goods, falling prices, disturbances of the economy
 isliye utpaadan ko rajya kanoonon se niyantrit karnaa padataa he
 The state has to give special incentives to boost exports
 isi prakaar aayaat par kar ke rup main niyantran lagaana padate hai, jisase ki maal atyaadhik aayaat nahin ho jaae
 Import facilities are provided only to certain companies
 ise audyogic pratibandh or vyapaarik niyantran kehete hai
 New trading markets and colonies - To obtain trade markets abroad for consumption of finished goods sent out of the country and from there to obtain raw materials for the industry and businesses of the country
 aisi vyapaarik mandiyaan praapt karne ke liye shaktishaalee rajyon ne videshon main apane upnivesh basaaye jahaan rajya main bani hui vastuon ko saralata se laabhprad daron par bechaa ja saktaa tha
 Raw materials from the markets of these colonies could also be easily bought at cheaper prices and imported into the country
 saste daamon par kaccha maal uplabdh ho jane se desh ke kal-kaarkaanon or udyogon main kam laagat par adhik utpaadan hoga
 This will benefit the country more financially
 is prakaar vaanijyawad ne upniveshwaad or samrajyavad kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Sea Trips and Geographical Discoveries - Daring sailors such as Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Amerigo, Magellan, Jan Kebat made many risky sea voyages to discover new countries
 vahaan dhire-dhire nai vastiyaan basaai gayin
 Western countries of Europe especially Spain, Portugal, Holland, France and England established their colonies and trading cities in newly discovered countries
 in upniveshon se chamada, loha, rui oon aadi kaccha maal praapt kar apane desh main inase naveen vastuen nirmit kar upniveshon ko niryaat ke rup main bheji or badale main vahaan se prachur maatra main swarna or chaandi praapt kii
 This led to accumulation of capital, increased import-export and made the country prosperous
 punarjagran kaa prabhaav - punarjagran ne europe main naveen vaigyanik drushtikon ke saath-saath maanavjivan ke prati adhik abhiruchi or aakankshaayen utpann kii
 The tendency to make human life more interesting and prosperous was encouraged
 isse bhautikwaad kii vruddhi hui
 The demand for sufficient funds for the fulfillment of material comforts increased and this increasing money could be obtained only from commerce and trade
 isse vaanijyawad ko protsaahan mila
 Money circulation and banking system - With the increase of various businesses, industries and trade, there were modifications, reforms and changes in business and business systems
 vaigyanik anveshanon ke aadhaaron par udyog-dhandhon main adhikadhik utpaadan or vyapaar main vastuon kaa adhikadhik kray-vikray hone laga
 This increased currency circulation and led to the beginning and development of the modern banking system
 bainkon ne apane jamaa dhan ko anya vyapaariyon, vyavsaayiyon or udyogpatiyon ko uski saakh par udhaar diya or unke vyapaarik vastuon ke kray-vikray sambandhi bhugtan ko saralata se kiya
 This gave greater encouragement to commercialism
 dhire-dhire adhikadhik poonji ko vyapaariyon ko uplabdh karaane hetu joint stock companiyaan sthapit kii gayin or unka vikaas kiya gaya
 The savings of many people were accumulating in these giant stock companies and banks
 is dhan ko bade-bade udyogon or videshi vyapaar main lagaaya gaya
 Large factories were established and developed on a large scale
 isse vishaal paimaane par vastuon kaa utpaadan badha, badi maatra main vastuon kaa vitaran or kray-vikray hone legaa
 This marked the beginning of a new era of domestic and foreign trade and commercialism
 navdith rashtra rajyon dwaara protsaahan or sangrakshan - europe main pandrahavin or solahavin sadi main rashtriya rajyon kaa udai or vikaas hua
 These powerful national kings established internal peace in the country and provided protection to the country from external invasions
 suraksha or shanti ke vaataavaran main udyog-dhandhe or deshi-videshi vyapaar badha or rashtriya raajaaon ne sone-chaandi ke aayaat ko protsaahit kiya
 In the meantime, having received enough money in the form of taxes from the merchants, the national kings fought and expanded the boundaries of their kingdom and established new colonies in other continents
 unhone udyogpatiyon or vyapaariyon ko protsaahit kiya ki ve upniveshon se vyapaar karke apni dhan-sampatti badhaawein
 As a result, the increasing trade and economic prosperity of the country became the power of the national state
 in paristhitiyon main vaanijyawad or poonjeewaad khub fale-foole
 The ideology of commercialism dominated Europe for nearly 250 years
 vaanijyawad kii vichaardhaara ne europe ke rashtron kii aarthik niti ko dhaala
 International trade in Europe begins with commercialism
 aarthik laabh ke liye vibhinn rashtron ne santulit aayaat-niryaat kii niti apanaayi
 Due to commercialism, gold and silver and money were obtained on a large scale from abroad by exporting goods of new industries more and more
 is siddhant ko apanaaya gaya ki vastuon kaa adhikadhik niryaat karnaa or aayaat kam karnaa, jisase desh adhik samrudh ho jaae
 Procurement and import of foreign goods were discouraged
 swadeshi udyogon ko protsaahit karne hetu utpaadan main adhikadhik vruddhi kii gai
 New colonies were established for obtaining raw materials and for the sale and consumption of finished goods
 isse aupniveshik samrajya bane
 The adoption of policies and principles of commercialism led to the formation of great powerful states in England, France and Germany
 sheeghra hi inkaa samrajya europe ke baahar mahadwipon main fail gaya
 Capitalism - Commercialism gave rise to capitalism by the spread of industries
 is poonjeewaad se europea samaaj main do virgon kaa udai hua- pratham poonjipatiyon or udyogpatiyon kaa varg jisane utpaadan ke sadhano par apana ekadhikaar sthapit kar liya, or dwitiya sarvhaara varg jiske paas swayan ke swaamitv ke utpaadan ke saadhan nahin hone se apane shram ko sast daamon par bechnaa padataa tha
 This led to a fierce struggle between the capitalist and the proletariat over the years, which led to revolts and revolutions and the economic system was shaken
 sankeern rashtriyata - vaanijyawad ne ek raashtra ko mahatv dekar uski samruddhi ke liye duusare anya rashtron ke shoshan kaa maarg prashast kiya
 One nation became more empowered and thriving and other small countries became poorer by being exploited
 is prakaar sankeern rashtriyata kaa maarg prashast hua
 International trade and colonial competition - Commercialism replaced international friendly and colonial competition in place of sweet friendly international relations in different countries, leading to subversive wars
 sone-chaandi ke sanchay kii nirarthakta - vaanijyawad ne sona-chaandi praapt kar uske sanchay par adhik mahatv diya
 As a result, the class with which gold and silver were accumulated became immoral, luxurious and corrupt on the basis of immense wealth
 samaaj main naitik mulya samaapt ho gaye
 On the development of industrial businesses, it was revealed that iron, steel, coal, mineral oil etc
 are more valuable than gold and silver reserves in a country
 inke samuchit dohan se raashtra adhik samrudh or shaktishaalee hoga
 This theory made the gold-silver reserves redundant
 krishi kii upeksha - vaanijyawad ke samarthakon ne udyog-dhandhon or vyavsaayon ke adhiktam vikaas par bal diya
 This left the agricultural sector underdeveloped and backward
 kisi bhi desh kii aarthik samruddhi ke liye krishi or udyog-dhandhon kaa santulit vikaas hona chahie
 Lack of public welfare - Commercialism gave more importance to the state and ruler in the political field and business and trade in the economic field
 sarvhaara varg yaa daridr janata yaa aarthik rup se pichde varg ke hit main, lok kalyaan main koi abhiruchi nahin lee, iske liye koi yojana yaa siddhant nahin the
 The poor, craftsmen, workers were exploited in commercialism
 rajasatta or rajbhakti main vruddhi - vaanijyawad ke samarthakon, vyapaariyon or udyogpatiyon ne shaktishaalee rajya kaa samarthan kiya kyonki unke hit sanvardhan ke liye shashakt raja hi aantarik shanti or bahya suraksha pradaan kar saktaa tha
 Later, with the abundance of wealth and prosperity in the country, the mighty king became autocratic arbitrary ruler
 raajaaon or shaskaon ne apni shaktiyon adhikaron kaa durupyog kiya
 Later, there were rebellions against his autocracy
 uparokt kaarnon se vaanijyawad ke viruddh teevr ansatosh failane laga or 19veen sadi main parivartit paristhitiyon main iske siddhanton kaa virodh hua
 It was for these reasons that commercialism declined
