 In his first report about this journey, Time had expressed his deep doubts on reaching the destination of the Salt Yatra
 usne daawa kiya ki duusare din paidal chalane ke baad gandhi ji jameen par pasar gaye the
 The magazine did not believe that there was any strength left to go further in the body of this saintly monk

 Time wrote that the huge public support that this journey is receiving has made the British rulers restless
 ab ve bhi gandhi ji ko aisa sadhu or jananetaa kah kar salaami dene lage hai jo isai dhirmaavalambiyon ke khilaaf isai tareekon kaa hi hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal kar rahaa he
 The salt trip was notable for at least three reasons
 pehla, yahi vah ghatana thi jiske chalate mahatma gandhi duniya kii najar main aae
 The trip was given extensive coverage by the European and American press
 duusare, yah pehali rashtravaadi gatividhi thi jisamen auraton ne bhi bad-chadh kar hissaa liya
 Socialist activist Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay explained to Gandhiji that he should not confine his movements to men
 kamaladevi khud un asankhya auraton main se ek thim jinhone namak yaa sharaab kanoonon kaa ulanghan karte hue samuhik girafatari di thi
 The third and perhaps most important reason was that it was due to the Salt Yatra that the British realized that now their rule would not last long and they would have to share power in the Indians

 Brent Fraser "billy" Boden is an international cricket umpire from New Zealand

 He is particularly known for his dramatic notation style that includes the "crooked finger of doom" for the sign of the out
 march 1995 main boden ne newjiland or srilanka ke bich hamiltan main pehla ek divasiy antarrashtriya match aupchaarik rup se nibhaayaa
 In March 2000, he was appointed as his first Test match umpire at a ground and in 2002 he was included in the Emirates panel of International Umpires
 ek saal baad unhen dakshin africa main cricket vishwa cap ke ampire ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya or bharat evam australia ke bich khele jane vaale final match main chauthe ampire ke rup main chunaa gaya
 Shortly thereafter, he was duly promoted as a member of the ICC Umpire's Emirates Elite Panel, of which he is still a member
 vishwa cap cricket 2007 ke final main chauthe ampire ke rup main unhone apni bhoomika doharaai or galat nirnay ke kaaran match anishchayta ke andhere main samaapt hua
 Boden was embroiled in an incident in the Brisbane Ashes Test in 2006 when a ball from Geraint Jones, standing at the square leg fielding spot, fell to the ground
 In January 2007, Boden became the youngest umpire in the 100th ODI, formalizing the match played between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Hamilton, which was in line with his first ODI in 1995
 kuch dinon ke baad simon toffel kaa record isse behatar ho gaya
 Because of his arthritis, it was very painful for Boden to signal a batsman out of the traditional fashion by lifting the index finger in a straight line with the head, and this led to the use of the "crooked finger of doom"

 Martin Crowe has named him as the clown bozo and at least one commentator has said that he should remember that it is for the cricketers and not the umpire
 However, a suggestion has also been made for them that they need to adopt their own signaling style because of the rheumatism, as they must maintain their body fluids

 Conspiracy theory is a term originally used to refer to a neutral descriptor of a civil, criminal or political conspiracy claim
 haalanki, yah baad main kaaphi apmanjanak ho gaya or puri tarah sirf haashiye par sthit us siddhant ke liye prayukt hone laga, jo kisi aitihaasik yaa vartmaan ghatana ko lagbhag atimanviya shakti praapt or chaalaak shadyantrkariyon kii gupt sajeesh ke parinaam ke rup main vyakhyayit karata he
 Conspiracy theories are viewed with skepticism by scholars, as they are rarely supported by conclusive evidence and contrary to institutional analysis, which focuses on the collective behavior of people in publicly known entities and which is historically And scholarly materials to explain current events and on facts recorded in mainstream media reports Held there, not the motives and speculative actions of secretive coalitions of individuals
 isliye yah shabd aksar halke rup se ek vishwaas ko chitrit karne ke prayaas ke rup main prayukt hota he, jo vicitra tarah kaa jhooth ho or sanakee ke rup main chihnit kiye hue yaa unmaadi prakruti ke logon vaale samooh dwaara vyakt kiya gaya ho
 is tarah kaa chithran apane sambhavit anauchity or anupyuktata ke kaaran aksar vivaad kaa vishay hota he
 According to political scientist Michael Barkun, conspiracy theories were once marginalized or limited to a small number of people, but have now become common to public media
 ve tark dete hai ki isane shadyantrwaad kii avadharana paidaa hone main yogadan diya, jo 20 veen sadi ke aakhir or 21 veen sadi ke prarambh main sanyukt rajya america main saanskrithik ghatana ke rup main ubhara or janata ke man main raajnneetik karrwai ke prabhavi pratimaan ke rup main loktantr ke sambhavit pratisthaapan ke rup main sajeesh ko mana gaya
 According to anthropologists Todd Sanders and Harry G
 West "the evidence suggests that today a broad class of Americans xxrep 5 
 accepts at least some of the theories of conspiracy as true
 " isliye shadyantr ke siddhanton main vishwaas samajashastriyon, manovaigyanikon or lokkathaon ke visheshgyon kii ruchi kaa ek vishay ho gaya he
 The term "conspiracy theory" can be a neutral modifier for any legitimate or illegal claim of civil, criminal or political conspiracy
 shadyantr karne kaa matlab he, "kisi avaidh yaa galat kaary ko puraa karne ke liye ek gupt samjhauta karnaa yaa kisi vaid makasad ko hasil karne ke liye aise tareekon kaa upyog karnaa
" haalanki, shadyantr ke siddhant kaa prayog ek varnanaatmak vidha kii ore ingit karne ke liye bhi hota he, jisamen bade shadyantron ke astitv ke liye vyapak tarkon kaa ek gada chayan shaamil ho
 In this sense the term "theory" is sometimes considered more informal as "speculation" or "preconception" rather than mainstream scientific theory
 iske alaava sajeesh shabd aam taur par shaktishaalee chehron, aksar un pratishthanon ke liye prayukt hota he, jinpar ek badi jansankhya ko dhokhaa dene kaa vishwaas kiya jaataa he, jaise raajnneetik bhrashtachar
 haalanki kuch shadyantr vastav main siddhant nahin hote, lekin ve aksar aam janata dwaara is rup main chihnit kar diye jate hai
 The first recorded use of the phrase "conspiracy theories" dates from 1909
 multah yah ek tatasth shabd tha, lekin 1960 ke dashak main hui raajnneetik uthapatak ke baad isane apane vartmaan apmanjanak arth ko dhaaran kiya
 It joined the Oxford English Dictionary as a supplement in late 1997
 "shadyantr siddhant" shabd vidwaanon or lokapriy samskritiyon dwaara "logon" se takat, paisa yaa aazaadee kaa "haran karne" ke makasad se kii gayi gupt sainya, banking, yaa raajnneetik karravaayiyon kii pahchaan ke liye baar baar prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In a less prevalent sense, it is used as folklore and urban historiography and a variety of interpretive narratives, which are associated with mythology
 yah shabd in daavon ko swat: khaarij karne ke apmanjanak arth main bhi istemaal hota he, jo haasyaaspad, nasamajhipurn, paagalpan bharaa, niraadhaar, vicitra yaa ataarkik ho
 udhaaharan ke liye "waterget shadyantr siddhant" shabd aam taur par sweekrut arth ke liye nahin hota he, jisamen vastav main kai pratibhaagiyon ko shadyantr ke chalate doshi tehraaya gaya or dusron ko aarope darj karne se pehle hi maaf kar diya gaya, balki iskaa vaikalpik or atirikt siddhanton vaale arth ke liye kiya jaataa he jaise ye daawey ki "deep throt" kaha jane vaala soochna strot gadha hua tha
 In his opening article titled "adapted from a Study Prepared for the CIA", Daniel Pipes attempted to define it, believing in distinguishing the 'mindset conspiracy' from more traditional patterns of thought
 unhone ise is rup main paribhaashit kiya: jo dikhataa he, vah dhokhaa he; shadyantr itihaas ko sanchalit karata he; kuch bhi avyavasthit nahin he, dushman hameshaa takat, shoharat, paisa or sex hasil karata he
 According to West and Sanders, when conspiracies were being talked about in the Vietnam era, Pipes incorporated the marginalized elements into thinking that conspiracies played a major role in major political scandals and murders, which in the Vietnam era Shook American politics
 "he sees a frenzied style in any significant historical or socio-scientific analysis of oppression
 " Political scientist Michael Barkun has classified conspiracy theories in ascending order of width, which are as follows: ek vaishvik vichaar shadyantr ke siddhanton ko kendrit rup main itihaas main kabhi-kabhi "shadyantrwaad" ke rup main darj karata he
 Historian Richard Hofstadter in an essay titled The Paranoid Style of American Politics, published in 1964, discusses the role of paranoia and conspiracyism throughout American history
 barnard belin kii shastreey pustak da idological origins of american revolushan main kaha gaya he ki is tarah kii avadharana america kranti ke dauraan paayi ja sakati he
 Conspiracyism then marks the attitudes of the people as well as those types of conspiracy theories which are more global and historical in proportion
 shadyantrwaad shabd 1980 ke dashak main shikshavid frank pi
 mintj dwaara lokapriy kiya gaya
 In relation to conspiracy theories and conspiracyism, a wide range of calibrations can be introduced as a basis for the study of the genre from academic work
 shadyantrwaad ke agrani vidwaanon main shaamil hai: hophstadter, karl poper, maaikel barkun, robert alan goldvarg, dainiel pips, mark fenster, mintj, karl sagon, jorge johnson or gerald posnar
 According to Mintz, conspiracyism is an indicator: "belief in the primacy of conspiracies in open history
": "shadyantrwaad america or anya jagahon main vibhinn raajnneetik or saamaajik samoohon kii jarurat ko puraa karata he
 It identifies the elite class, blames them for economic and social catastrophe and believes that once they were removed from positions of power through popular action, things could have been better
 jaise, shadyantr ke siddhant ek khaas yugkaal yaa vichaardhaara ke prakaar nahin bataate
" Throughout human history, political and economic leaders have been the cause of literally large numbers of deaths and disasters, and they have sometimes been involved in promoting conspiracy theories about their goals at the same time
 hitler or stallin sabase pramukh udaahranon main se hai ; anya saare udhaaharan bhi hai
 In some cases, the claims were dismissed as conspiracy theories, but they later proved to be true
 The idea that history itself is controlled by long-term conspiracies was refuted by historian Bruce Cummings: "lekin agar shadyantr maujuud hai, ve shaayad hi kabhi itihaas ko badalte hai; ve samay-samay par seemaant par fark laa sakate hai, lekin unke rachanakaaron ke niyantran ke baahar ek tark ke apratyaashit parinaamon ke saath: or yahi 'shadyantr siddhant' ke saath galat baat he
 History is changed by large forces and extensive structures of human groups
 " The use of the term Conspiracyism Michael Kelly, Chip Burlett and Matthew N
 Is written in Lyons
 berlett or liyons ke anusaar, "shadyantrwaad bali kaa bakra banane kaa ek khaas vrutantaatmak rup he, jo pashachik dushmano ko ek aam taur par bhale kaary ke khilaaf badi aantarik sajeesh main fansaata he, jabaki yah bali ke us bakre ko khatre kii ghanti bajaane vaale vaale nayak ke rup main aankata he
 " shadyantr ke siddhant shikshavidon, rajanetaaon or prachaar madhyamon dwaara vyapak aalochana kaa vishay he
 Perhaps the most controversial aspect of a conspiracy theory is the problem of exposing the truth of a particular theory, so that both the creator and the opposer can satisfy it
 Certain conspiracy charges may vary greatly, but may apply some of the common standards applied in each case to assess their potential truthfulness
 sanyukt rajya america ke pratishthan ke shaikshik aalochak nom chomuski shadyantr ke siddhant ko kam yaa adhik sansthagat vishleshan ke vipareet rakhaa he, jo vyaktiyon ke gupt sathganth ke badale mukhyat: janata, saarvajanik rup se gyaat sansthaaon ke dderghaavadhi vyavhaar va mukhyadhara kii media rapaton par zyada kendrit hoti he
 Controversy The general discussion of conspiracy theory is a matter of some public consensus apart from disputes arising out of the merits of certain conspiracy claims
 vibhinan paryvekshakon dwaara "shadyantr siddhant" shabd ko ek shadyantrpurn daawey kaa nishpaksh varnan qaraar kiya gaya he, jo ek apmanjanak shabd he, jiskaa prayog is tarah ke daawey ko bina pariksha ke khaarij karne ke liye kiya jaataa he or is tarah ke daawey ko badhaava dene waalon dwaara sakaaratmak samarthan dene kaa sanket karne ke liye bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term may be used by some people for an argument they do not fully believe in, but consider it transformative and exciting
 is shabd kaa sabase vyapak rup se sweekrut arth vah he, jo lokapriy samskruti or shaikshanik upyog ke chalan main he or nishchit rup se iskaa vaktaa kii sambhavit satyavadita par nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 Conspiracy theories on the Internet are often dismissed as "marginalized" groups, but evidence suggests that a large proportion of Americans today, regardless of ethnic, gender, education, occupation, and other groups - At least some conspiracy theories are considered credible
 is shabd ke lokapriy arth ko dekhte hue bhi inkaa vastav main thos or puure sabooton vaale aaropon ko khaarij karne ke saadhan ke rup main avaidh rup se or anupyukt prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore the validity of each such use will be the subject of some controversy
 In his 1996 essay "the JKF Assassination 2: Conspiracophobia on the Left" written by Michael Paranti, examining the progressive media role in the use of the term, vaastuvaadi or sansthagat vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki is shabd kaa tab durupyog kiya jaataa he, jab vah un sansthaaon par lagu hota he, jo apane sweekrut lakshyon ke anusaar kaary kar rahe hai, jaise munaafe main vruddhi ke liye jab nigamon kaa ek samooh ke mulya ko sthir karne main sanlagn hota he
 Complications can occur for concepts such as ufos, which literally means "unidentified flying object", but it also has an associated meaning with an alien spacecraft, which is associated with certain theories of concept conspiracy, and thus something special It is also associated with social stigma
 maaikel parenti is shabd ke prayog kaa ek udhaaharan dete hai, jo iske khud ke prayog main paraspar virdohi dikhataa he
 they write, "shadyantr siddhant" shabd khud shadyantr siddhant kaa ek prakaar kaa vishay he, jo yah tark detaa he ki shabd kaa prayog charchaa ke vishay ke prati darshakon ke upeksha bhav main jod-tod karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, yaa to sach ko chupaane ke jaanboojhkar kiye gayi prayaas ke rup main yaa jaanboojhkar kii gai sajeesh ke chalaave ke rup main
 When conspiracy theories are presented as official claims, they are not generally considered conspiracy theories
 For example, some of the decided activities of the House un-american Activities Committee may be called an official attempt to promote conspiracy theory, although its claims are rarely referred to as such
 aage is shabd ke siddhant kii aspashtataa se kathinaaiyaan paidaa hoti hai
 In popular usage, the term is often referred to as speculation based on unfounded or weak facts, leading to the idea that "if it is indeed true then it is not a conspiracy theory
" " In 1936, American commentator H
L
 Menken wrote: kam se kam 1960 ke dashak ke baad se shadyantr ke siddhanton main vishwaas samajashastriyon, manovaigyanikon or lokkathaon ke visheshgyon ke liye ruchi kaa ek vishay ban gaya, jab america raashtrapati jon epa kennedy kii hatya ke baad antat warren ayog kii report main darj tathyon ke aadhaar par maamle ke sarkari sanskaran ke khilaaf janata kii ek abhootpurv pratikriya ai
 According to some psychologists, if one person believes in one theory of conspiracy then others will also believe in it; a person who does not believe in one theory of conspiracy, will not believe in another either
 This may also be due to differences between the information on which the parties believe in formulating their conclusions
 manovaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki shadyantrwaad or shadyantr ke siddhant ke vikaas main arth kii talash aam baat he or yah akele itnaa shaktishaalee ho saktaa he, jo sabase pehle ek vichaar kaa nirmaan kar sake
 ek baar sangyaan hone par pushti kaa purvaagrah or sangyanatmak viswarata kaa parihaar vishwaas ko sudrudh kar saktaa he
 In a context, where a conspiracy theory has become popular in a social group, then communal reinforcement may equally be part of a role
 britain ke kent vishvavidhyalay main kiye gayi kuch shodh se pataa chalata he ki log yah jane bina shadyantr ke siddhanton se prabhavit ho sakate hai ki unka nazirya badal gaya he
 After studying some popular conspiracy theories about the death of Princess Diana of Walls, its participants accurately deduced how much their peers' attitudes had changed, but significantly underestimated them
 How much his attitude has changed in favor of conspiracy theories
 lekhakon ne nishkarsh nikaala ki shadyantr ke siddhanton main 'ek chhipi hui shakti' hoti he, jo logon ko prabhavit karti hai
 Humanist psychologists argue that even though a secret party behind the conspiracy has always had a hostile stance, there is an element of reassurance to conspiracy theorists, as it provides comfort to think that human affairs matters Complications and disturbances are at least borne by humans, not by factors outside human control
 Such a secret party is a tool to reassure itself that some events are not random, but are ordered by human intelligence
 yah pradarshit karata he ki is tarah kii ghatnaein subodh or sambhavit rup se niyantran karne yogya hoti hai
 If the adventures of a clandestine party can be indulged in a sequence of events, there is always little, but hope, but to weaken the strength of a small clandestine group — or to join it and that power itself To use
 Finally a belief in the strength of a small clandestine group is the undisputed assertion of human dignity — even if subconsciously, but necessarily a declaration that the man is not at all helpless, but that he is responsible, at least in some cases, for his own fate

 According to logic, this projection appears as an undesirable attribution of self-characteristics to the conspirators

 It is difficult to counteract the conclusion that this enemy is in many respects the antithesis of self-projection, attributed to both ideal and self-denying aspects

 For some individuals, there may be an obsessive compulsion to believe, prove, or re-state a theory of conspiracy, and is an indication that one or more fully understood psychological conditions and other hypothetical situations: Paranoia, denial, schizophrenia can be Mean World Syndrome

 siddhant ko graahak ke liye ek bhaavnaatmak rup se pareshaan kar ghatana yaa vyaktiyon kaa ek spasht rup se kalpana samooh kii sthiti ke liye naitik jimmedaari pradaan karne main sakasham he
 The important thing is that the group does not include theists
 The believer may feel free from any moral or political obligation to diagnose, even if an institutional or social flaw may be the real source of differences
 jahaan jimmedaar saamaajik vyavhaar saamaajik sthitiyon dwaara roka jaataa he yaa saadhaarant: ek vyakti kii kshamta se pare hota he, to shadyantr kaa siddhant bhaavnaatmak mukti yaa band kii prakriya ko aasaan banaata he, jahaan aisi bhaavnaatmak chunautiyon kii jarurat hoti he
 Conspiracy theories, like moral panic, emerge again and again in communities that experience social isolation and political disempowerment

 Media commentators routinely note the news media and popular culture's tendency to perceive events through the spectacles of individual agents as opposed to the more complex structural aspect

 a second, perhaps related, figurative language of media attempts to determine personal responsibility for negative events
 media main ek pravriti he ki agar ek ghatana hoti he to vah aparaadhiyon kii talash shuru karata he or itnaa mahatvapurn hota he ki yah kuch dinon ke bheetar apni khabar ke agenda se ise nahin hataata

 Hollywood cinema and TV shows continue to perpetuate and expand belief in conspiracy as the standard functioning of corporations and governments
 ianimi of da state and shooters jaisi feechar filmein un bahut sari filmon main se hai, jo shadyantr ko ek saamaanya kaamkaaj ke rup main aage badhaati he or ye shadyantron par sawaal uthaane kii pravriti ko bhi tyaag detii hai, jo kareeb 1970 se pehle ke film yug main ek khaasiyat thi
 In the context of jfk's assassination, the shooter works with the same system, "as conspiracies work"
 It is interesting that movies and TV shows act like news media in relation to humanization and dramatization of issues, which are easy to incorporate into a conspiracy theory
 ghar aana vietnam yuddh ke ghayal sainik ke lautne ko ek badi samasya main badal detaa he, kyonki ek mauka dikhataa he ki ghayal sainik prem jaal main funs jaayegaa or jab vah aisa karata he to iskaa ek majboot nishkarsh yah nikalataa he ki ek badi samasya kaa hal ho gaya
 This aspect is a natural result of the development of Hollywood scripts, which give more importance to one or two lead characters, who are acted by big stars and thus establish a good way of marketing the film, but after testing Chakravyuh of illegal people is exposed

 Nowadays "news" is almost always dramatized in the concept of fictional journalism, at least "one side" is offered against the other, the concept that all stories must include "both sides" or There should be more intense theatrical developments like feature films
 Through this explicit dramatization, the media reinforces the idea that all things are intentionally for the benefit of someone, which may be another definition, at least, of political conspiracy theories

 Daniel Pipes wrote an article in the Jerusalem Post in 2004 titled Fusion Paranoria: The politically disaffected: Blacks, the hard Right, and other alienated elements 
 Their theories imply a political agenda, but lack much of a following
 The culturally suspicious: These include "kennedy assassinologists," "ufologists," and those who believe a reptilian race runs the earth and alien installations exist under the earth's surface
 Such themes enjoy enormous popularity, but carry no political agenda
 The major new development, reports Barkun, professor of political science in the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, is not just an erosion in the divisions between these two groups, but their joining forces with occultists, persons bored by rationalism
 Occultists are drawn to what Barkun calls the "cultural dumping ground of the heretical, the scandalous, the unfashionable, and the dangerous" – such as spiritualism, Theosophy, alternative medicine, alchemy, and astrology
 Thus, the author who worries about the Secret Service taking orders from the Bavarian Illuminati is old school; the one who worries about a "joint reptilian-bavarian Illuminati" takeover is at the cutting edge of the new synthesis
 These bizarre notions constitute what Michael Kelly termed "fusion paranoia," a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever
 Conspiracy theories exist in the realm of myth, where imaginations run wild, fears trump facts, and evidence is ignored
 As a superpower, the United States is often cast as a villain in these dramas

 Popper argued that totalitarianism was built on "conspiracy theories" that led to fictional schemes driven by paranoid scenarios on tribalism, dominationism or racism

" " He reiterated that "there are conspiracies that must be accepted
 But the recordable facts, which in spite of their fallacy, prove the conspiracy theory to be false, are that some of these conspiracies were ultimately successful

 Umberto Eco's novel Foucault Pendulum is a befitting satire on conspiracyism, in which the character attempts to form a conspiracy theory backed by all, and in which the military theologians and Bavarian theologians, the Rosicrucian groups studying logic, the Hallow Earth Enthusiast, the Catharsis, and the Roman Catholic priests

 Other novels, such as Dan Brown's 2000 controversial book "angeles and Demons", also popularized conspiracy theories
 The book revolves around the search for Robert Langdon, a fictional symbolist at Harvard University who is intent on unraveling the mysteries of a secret society called Illuminati

 Political scientist Michael Barkun, who specializes in the study of conspiracyism in American culture, writes that the 1997 film Conspiracy Theory exposed a large audience to the belief that the US government was controlled by a secret team sitting in black helicopters — though This idea was once confined to right-wing extremists

 jis samaaj main soochna kaa srijan, vitaran, upyog, ekikaran aadi ek mahatvapurn aarthik, rajnatik evam saanskrithik kriyalap ban chukaa ho vah soochna-samaaj kehalaata he
 This notion of an organized society around the production, exchange and consumption of information was articulated in the nineties
 sattar ke dashak ke madhya main danniel bel ke uttar-audyogic samaaj sambandhi lekhan main soochna-samaaj kii aahaten suni ja sakati thim, par nabbe ke dashak main internet jaisi global information praudyogikiyon ke visfot ke baad hi yah vichaar puri tarah viksit ho paaya
 The relationship of information and information society is more or less the same as that between industries and industrial age
 mashiinon, kaarakaanon or ujrati shram kaa astitv audyogic yug se pehle bhi tha, lekin unnisvin sadi main unki kendriyata kuch is tarah se badi ki logon kii zindagi or unke drushtikon main buniyadi tabdili ho gayi
 Information, which was always present and important, has become the regulator of human society during the last three decades due to a certain technological state
 iske kaaran saamaajik sanghathan kaa ek vishisht rup paidaa ho gaya he jisamen utpaadakta or satta kaa buniyadi strot soochnaaon ke utpaadan, sansaadhan or prasaaran main nihit he
 Information has taken the form of the most valuable and necessary commodity
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki kaarkaanaa- utpaadan or seva-aadhaarit arthvyavastha kaa mahatva khatm ho gaya he
 These sectors of the economy are playing their role, but the concepts of industrial society or post-industrial society are no longer the main driving force of change
 kuch vidwaanon kaa aagrah he ki soochna-samaaj kii parighatna soochna-aadhaarit bazaaron ke chautarfa udai kii roshni main paribhaashit kii jaani chahie
 Information-based capital can generate far more wealth than manual labor
 soochna-aadhaarit utpaadon kii sankhya bahut tezi se badi or badhati hi ja rahi he
 In 1945, more than all the computer-power was present on the entire earth, only one who heard music is opened in a greeting card as soon as it opens
 subah kaagaz par chapa akhbaar kholte hi ham pathak ke saath-saath shrota bhi ho jate hai
 Our eyes are not only on the information entered in the advertisements, but also on the sound of a small instrument engaged in some advertisement, while promoting the product
 kisi jamaane main car kii zyaadaatar keemat usamen lage ispaat ke aadhaar par tay hoti thi, par aaj nayi toyota car kaa 70 fisadi se zyaada mulya uske informatics sambandhi ghatak se nikaala jaataa he
 Based on the information received on the basis of market research, the character and tendencies of the consumer are identified, which has a decisive effect on production decisions
 jaivik soochnaaon kii decoding ke madhyam se vigyaan kii sambhaawanaaon main lagaataar vruddhi kii ja rahi he
 This has resulted in the Human Genome Project
 chloning or soochna kii pratikruti bananaa ek-duusare ke paryaay hi hai
 Information technologies have become the medium of mobility and spread of markets and cultures
 raashtra-rajya bhu-kshetron par kabze or niyantran ke liye aaj bhi sangharsh karte hai
 Imperialist and neo-colonial campaigns are still carried out to exploit the resources of raw materials and cheap labor
 lekin soochnaaon par kaabiz hone ke liye kiya jane vaala sangharsh aaj kahin zyaada bada ho chukaa he
 Information is a paradigm through which new trends in social development can be explained
 soochna-aadhaarit vikaas-kram ke kaaran media, aushadhi or nigaraanee se sambandhit praudyogiki se sambandhit naitik sarokaaron kaa janm hua he
 Questions related to the definition of information distribution, authority and authorship are becoming increasingly controversial
 ye nayi pravritiyaan keval sakaaratmak hi nahin hai
 Meditation is also going on due to the problems arising due to the interruption of information among thinkers
 soochna-samaaj main gyaan kii sanrachanaon kii sthiti ko lekar bhi samaajavaigyanikon main kaafii chintaa dekhi gayi he
 The debate on the information society has become polarized
 ek paksh kii manyata he ki samaaj ke is rup ne unhen azaadi ke naye ayaamon se parichit karaayaa he
 In such a society, people will be better able to express themselves as being more informed
 nayi praudyogikiyon ke madhyam se unhen raajnneetik or saanskrithik daayaron main behatar sahabhaagita kaa mauka mil paayegaa
 This side does not see any kind of risk in the dominance of technology
 iske vipareet doosraa paksh soochna-bahulya or soochna-pradhanta ke kaaran kai tarah kii duschintaaon kii taraf ishaara kar rahaa he
 Power structures are increasingly monitoring the activities of the individual and society by resorting to information technologies, which has brought privacy and privacy closer to the end
 nayi technolji ke zariye lagaataar nazar rakhana or record karnaa sambhav ho gaya he
 Apart from this, if our information related to buying and selling is also being collected, then on the basis of them, we can be pushed unknowingly towards a predetermined type of conduct
 yah paksh maanata he ki soochna-samaaj swatantra nahin he
 It is being controlled through a variety of decentralized networks
 pehle bentham ne or phuko ne jis panopticon ke vichaar kaa pratipaadan kiya he, vah soochna-samaaj kii paristhitiyon par puri tarah se lagu hota he
 The most well-known theorist of the information society is Manuel Cassells, whose work The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture has introduced this suffix
 kacells ke vimarsh se is prashn kaa santoshjanak uttar nahin miltaa ki soochna-samaaj main gyaan kii sanrachanaon kii kya sthiti hogi
 The thinking on which he defined information and knowledge came to light between 1962 and 1977
 marshall macluhan kaa media se sambandhit siddhant bhi saath ke dashak main prakashit hua tha
 According to the definitions given by this scripture, knowledge is created on the basis of information and information cannot be understood by disconnecting it from the technology that produces and transmits it
 natijatan praudyogikeey sthiti gyaan kii sanrachana ko gaharaai se prabhavit karti he
 If this discussion is correct, then the question arises that any sudden change in information technology will also change the knowledge in the information society
 jean-fraswan Lytor, in his postmodern conduction published in 1979, made the staggering observation that in the era of computerized capitalism, knowledge cannot exist without change
 lyotar ne usee samay dekh liya tha ki gyaan ‘suchanaatmak panya’ banataa ja rahaa he
 Digitization has transformed knowledge into pieces of information and those bits can be processed and transmitted to machines at faster speeds
 is tarah lyotar kii nigaah main soochna gyaan kaa vah rup ban jaati he jise channel ke marfat prasaarit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he taaki vah kargar yaa oparational ho sake
 In this sense, this form of knowledge is demonstrative and consequential rather than contemplative
 macluhan isi baat ko is tarah kehete hai ki soochna ek gair- vimarshi code yaa data he jise tivi ke chote-chote sound bits kii tarah utpaadit kiya jaataa he or manushya jiskaa mashiinon kii tarah upbhog karte chale jate hai
 In considering such a worrying state of knowledge in the information society, Scott Lash has distinguished narrative-based knowledge and technological information-based knowledge in his work Critique of Information
 lash ke anusaar aakhyaan aadhaarit gyaan dhiraj ke saath chintan or manan kii maang karata he, jabaki gyaan kaa yah nayaa rup jitani tezi se prakat hota he utani hi tezi se lupt bhi ho jaataa he
 In this sense, lashes consider information as representational rather than representational
 soochna ek ‘angadh tathyaatmakataa’ kaa naam he
 Its nature presents difficulty for theorists of society and culture
 unke paas soochna-samaaj ke daayaron se baahar rah kar unki aalochana viksit karne kaa koi mauka hi nahin he
 That is why they first have to rethink the basic assumptions that define culture and society
 ye dharanaayen aakhyanatmak gyaan kii upaj hone ke kaaran soochna-samaaj ke bheetar kargar sabit nahin hotin
