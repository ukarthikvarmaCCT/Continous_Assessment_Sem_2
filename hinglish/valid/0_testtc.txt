 When the thyroid gland begins to produce hormones in large quantities, the body begins to use more energy than the quantity
 ise hyper thyrodism kehete hai
 When the thyroid gland does not make enough amount of hormones, the body starts reducing energy usage by volume
 is avasthaa ko hypothyradism kehete hai
 These abnormal conditions can occur in a person of any age, however the disease occurs in five to eight times more women than men

 Macdonald sutaradhar naatak ke sabhi sutara apane haathon main dhaaran karata he
 He starts the play and ends the same
 kabhi kabhi naatak ke bich main bhi uski upasthiti hoti he
 Sometimes he conducts the play from the backstage ie backstage
 bhartiya rangaparampara main sutaradhar ko apane naam ke anuroop mahatv praapt he
 In Indian society, the world is called theater, life is theatrical, man or creature is called actor and God is the narrator
 yah mana jaataa he ki ishwar hi vah sutaradhar he, jiske haath main saare sutara hote hai or vah manushya yaa jeev rupi abhinayta ko sansar ke rangamanch par jivan ke natya main sanchalit karata he
 This regulatory role of the narrator is evident in our color conventions
 vah ek shaktishaalee rangarudhi ke rup main sanskrit rangamanch par uplabdh rahaa he
 The contribution of the narrator can also be underlined in the creation and development of traditional theatrical forms
 aadhunik rangakarm ke liye sutaradhar anek rangayuktiyon ko rachane main sakasham he, jiske kaaran rangamanch ke nae aayam saamne aa sakate hai
 This is such a conservative character, which has been tried to be invented again and again and is still capable of creating new colors
 vah abhinayta, darshak or naatak ke bich sutara banaae rakhane kaa mahatvapurn kaam karata he
 The sutra of sutradhara is deeply associated with Sanskrit color tradition
 vahaan ise sampurna arth kaa prakaashak, naandi ke pashchaat manch par sancharan karne vaala paatr tathaa shilpi kaha gaya he
 The narrator has also been recognized as an indicator and seer
 sutarabhrit, sutri or sutarakrut aadi naamon se bhi yah sambodhit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 It has also got the address of 'bhava'
 amarkosh 'bhav' ko vidwaan kaa paryaay maanata he
 Natyacharya has also been used as a synonym for sutradhara
 paryaay ke rup main prayukt hone vaale sutaradhar ke vividh naamon ke bheetar chhipe gunon ke aadhaar par lakshangranthon or shastron main sutaradhar kii vivechna hoti rahi he
 In the Natyasastra, Bharata Muni considers the sutradhar as the master of emotional songs, instrumental and textual formulas and is also called Upadesha
 natyacharya kii oopaadhi use upadeshta hone ke kaaran praapt hui
 The ancient Acharyas, while discussing the characteristics of the sutradhara, have also considered it as 'music is all'
 nrity, natya or katha ke sutron ko aapas main goonthne ke kaaran bhi use sutaradhar kii sangya di gai
 He informs the object, leader and rasa in the form of the poetic being presented
 nayak or kavi tathaa vastu ke vaishishty ko bhi sutarabaddh karata he
 He is proficient in toiletries
 roopak kii prastaavna ko upasthaapit karne vaala yah charitra sabhi abhinaytaon kaa pradhan mana gaya he
 Analyzing the nature of the sutradhar, the master of the Natyasastra, Matrugupta, is a master of four types of light, a master of many languages, a master of various kinds of speeches, ethics vaita, a knowledgeable of the costumes, a society's exponent, a speeder, a rasabha vishraad, a drama Proficient in experimentation and various craft arts, penetrating verses of verses, pundits of scriptures, knowledge of rhythm for songs and Su is considered adept at educating others
 pracheen acharya shantkarni sutaradhar ke lakshanon ko pratipaadit karte hue anushthan ko prayog kaa sutara or use dhaaran karne vaale ko sutaradhar maanate hai
 However, while narrowing the role of the narrator, Shantakarni admits that he does not play any role in the play, so he is an outsider
 acharya kohol yah maang karte hai ki sutaradhar ko naandi sambodhit kiya janaa chahie kyonki vah naandi paath karata he
 Bhasa considers it to be the regulator of the preamble, presentation and finale

 The secret of this peculiar nomenclature is that its Latin format required that investigative proceedings be certified by the "queens Bench Division" before being presented to the Empress
 utpreshnadesh tabhi jari kiye jate hai jab ki nyaayaadhikaran, athwa kalp nyaayadhikaaran ke aadesh unki shaktiseema kaa atikaraman karte hon, prakritik nyaay ke siddhanton kii avhelnaa karte hon athwa vidhaan ke kisi aise bhram se dooshit hon jo unamem spasht dikhaai padate hon 
 No such dilution test method has been invented by which we can draw a dividing line between the previous judicial proceedings and the administrative proceedings
 keval kalp nyaayik kaarywahiyon se utpann adeshon ke viruddh hi utpreshnadesh jari kiya ja saktaa he, isiilie vibhaajan kii aavashyaktaa upasthit hui he
 On the ground, it can be said that when the persons of a particular class are given the legitimate power to decide the rights of the individual by performing judicial duties, in that case their action will be hypothetical
 iske vipareet yadi kisi adhikari ke nirnay kaa moolyankan uski niti ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he, us dasha main vah kaarywahi saamanyat: prashasnic kahi jaaegi kintu sambandhit adhikari yadi sakshi dwaara sanwalit prajnpti tathaa aapatti ke hi aadhaar par kisi nirnay par pahunchataa he us dasha main yah aavashyak he ki adhikari nyaayik paddati kaa avlamban kare
 This type of proceeding will be partly imaginary, even if the final decision is called administrative
 koi kaarywahi kalp-nyaayik he yaa nahin, iskaa nirnay antatogatva teen baton par nirbhar hota he- An inducement order is issued to dismantle an order given by an officer if the officer subsequently has a personal interest in the subject, or if there is a prejudice in the mind of the subject or opposition to the subject
 keval nyaay kaa hona hi paryaapt nahin he apitu aavashyak he ki yah pratyaksh drushtigochar ho ki nyaay kiya gaya
 When an order is passed by an officer without giving the other party an opportunity of being heard, the impugned order is also issued
 utpreshan pradesh us nirnay ko dhwast karne ke liye bhi jari kiya jaataa he jiskaa dosha usamen pratyaksh drushtigochar hota he
 No definite explanation of "being directly visible" is possible, but it is certain that in the guise of this statement, the Court will not conduct the Court of Appeal
 jo nirnay sakshi dwaara sambalit nahin he, ve bhi is aadesh dwaara dhwast kiye ja sakate hai
 The court may also investigate the presence of sub-judicial facts, where a judicial or criminal officer makes a decision by forcibly encroaching its limits on the subject and any defective presumption
 anya saadhaaran dashaon main nyaayalay sakshi dwaara sambalit nishkarshon main hastkshep nahin karegaa
 The court will approve the Witnesses mentioned hereafter in the same condition when it is proved that the collapsed judgment was obtained by fraud or in so doing the violation of the jurisdiction

 Lattice – Boltzmann method is a class of computational fluid dynamics for fluid simulations
 nevier-stolls sameekaran hal karne ke bajaay, discreet boltzman sameekaran ko hal kiya jaataa he

 For this, it discretizes the space into a lattice and velocity space into the velocity sets vi { \ displaystyle v_ {i}}
 tab boltzman sameekaran, jo ab latis boltzman sameekaran ban chukaa he, ban jaataa he: The collision operator is often approximated by a BGK collision operator: where f i 0 { \ displaystyle f_{i}^{0}} is the local equilibrium distribution
 The moments of the fi { \ displaystyle f_ {i}} give the local conserved quantities
 The density is given by and the local momentum is given by For the popular isothermal lattice Boltzmann methods these are the only conserved quantities
 Thermal models also conserve energy and therefore have an additional conserved quantity: The collision operator has to respect the conservation laws
 Therefore the equilibirum distribution f i 0 { \ displaystyle f_{i}^{0}} must have the same conserved moments as the f i { \ displaystyle f_{i}}

 The early companies were purely economic ventures; But later it was realized that the main advantage of holding joint stock was that the stock of the company could not be seized in lieu of a person's debt
 The development of company law in Europe was interrupted in the 17th century by two notorious "bubbles", which led to the development of companies in two major jurisdictions, which remained popular for a century

 The final progression of the company's history was the decision of the 'house of Lord' in the case of 'salomon v

 Although a separate legitimate personality makes corporate groups flexible in the sense of tax planning, it also enables multinationals to manage the responsibility of their operations operating abroad

 Often this was a business objective and perceived as the objective of the company and the scope of the objectives is seen as the capability of the companies

 In the sense of exclusivity, the company's components were articulated with various corporate powers
 yadi uddeshy aisi chizein thi jise company karne main sakasham thi, tab shakti kaa arth vah tha jiske dwaara vah unhen sampann kar saktaa tha
 Often the expression of powers was limited to the method of raising capital, though the difference between purpose and powers has troubled lawyers since early times

 And many jurisdictions still allow the transaction to be challenged in lieu of the lack of "corporate profit", where the related transaction has no potential for commercial benefit to the company or its shareholders
 kritrim vyakti ke rup main, companiyaan keval maanav agenton ke jariye hi kaam kar sakati hai
 The Board of Directors is the main agent handling the management and business of the company, but in many jurisdictions other officers may also be appointed
 nideshak mandal kaa chayan saamanytah sadasyon dwaara tathaa anya adhikariyon kii niyukti mandal dwaara kii jaati he

 Third parties will rely on the authority of the agents hired by the company to act on its behalf
 Common law cases lead to 'royal British Bank v Tarkand', a passage of the general rule, where common law established that third parties were authorized to assume that the company's internal management was being handled properly And in most countries that rule has now been crooked

 The main difference between the different countries in the internal form of the company is to have two categories and one category board
 Most countries in the United Kingdom, the United States and the Commonwealth have a single unified board of directors
 germany main, companiyon main do shreniyan hoti hai, taaki shairdharak ek “paryvekshi mandal” kaa chayan kar sake or tab nigaraanee mandal “prabandhan mandal” ko chun sake
 There is a perception of the use of two categories in France and new European companies

 During post-war arguments based on the attainment of effective "corporate democracy" for shareholders or other stakeholders, many scholars began to discuss the law in the context of principal-agent problems
 is dharna ke aadhaar par corporate kanoon kaa mul mudda he ki jab koi "pradhan" paksh apni sampattiyon ko kisi "agent" ke niyantran main saunpta he tab ek sambhaavna rahati he ki pramukh kii ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kii bajaae agent apane hit main kaary karegaa or ‘avasarwaadi’ ho jayega

 The rules of corporations originate from two sources
 ye desh ke kanoon ); euke main company act 2006 ; germany main 'ekatingeseta' tathaa 'geseta betreffend daai gesselsshafaten mit besharanctor halftang ' hai
 The law determines which rules are mandatory and which rules can be devalued from it
 avamulyan nahin kiye ja sakane vaale mahatvapurn niyamon ke udaahranon main praayah nideshak mandalon ko naukari se barkhaast karnaa, company ke prati nideshkon ke kartavya, yaa diwaliyapan ke kagaar par pahunchane par company ko bhang karnaa aadi shaamil shaamil hote hai
 Such rules, which allow the company to change and select members, can be included, what are the methods to be followed in the processes of general meeting, when to pay dividends, how many members will make the constitution together
 Normally, the law will decide the ideal clauses, if it remains silent on any particular process, it will adopt the constitution of the corporation
 america tathaa kuch anya saamaanya niyam vaale deshon ne corporate samvidhan ko do pruthak dastauez main vibhajit kiya he
 a Memorandum of Association or 'articles of Incorporation' is the primary document and often regulates the activities of the company with the outside world
 It states the purpose to be followed by the company and the authorized share capital of the company
 ‘articals of association’ dwitiya dastauez hota he or saamanytah company ke aantarik maamalon tathaa prabandhan kaa niyaman karata he, jaise mandal kii baithak kii prakriya, labhaansh kaa nipataara ityadi
 aniyamitata kii sthiti main gyaapan-patr prabhavi rahata he tathaa america main keval gyaapan-patr hi saarvajanik kiya jaataa he
 In civil code jurisdictions, the company's constitution is usually concentrated in a single document, often called a charter
 company ke sadasyon kaa atirikt vyavastha ke saath corporate samvidhan kaa poorak hona kaafii aam he, jaise shairdharakon kaa samjhauta-patr, jahaan ve ek khaas tareeke se apane sadsyta adhikaar ko lagu karne ke liye sahamat hote hai
 The shareholders' agreement as a concept performs many similar functions as the corporate constitution but because it is a contract, it will not normally add a new member of the company unless they agree to it in some way Do not be
 One advantage of the shareholders 'agreement is that they are often confidential, as most jurisdictions do not have to publicly file a shareholders' agreement
 Another common method of compliance with the corporate constitution is voting trust, although this is relatively uncommon outside the US and some offshore jurisdictions

 The most important laws of corporate governance are those relating to the balance of power between members of the board of directors and members of the company
 niveshkon ke nivesh ko safal banane hetu board ko company ke sanchaalan ke liye praadhikaar saunpe jate hai
 The right to take certain decisions is reserved for shareholders where their interests may be fundamentally affected

 In most jurisdictions, directors have the duty to gain the trust of shareholders, care about the safety of the interests of the company and all its members, and make themselves efficient for this

 Directors have a duty to be efficient, care about the interests of the company and be diligent
 This right entitles the company to compensation from its director if it is proved that the company has suffered due to lack of adequate efficiency or care in the director
 nideshkon kaa kartavya yah bhi he ki company ke sarvottam hit main kaary karne ke liye ve apane hiton athwa kartavyon kaa takaraav na karen
 This rule is so strictly enforced that even if the conflict of interests or duties is wholly speculative, the directors may be compelled to return the personal benefits derived from it

 This principle is so strictly followed that no truth or falsity can be questioned in the contract concerned
 

” However, under many jurisdictions, members of the company are allowed to confirm such transactions which otherwise do not stand on this principle
 It is also widely accepted in many jurisdictions that this principle should be removed from the company's constitution

 As far as the exercise of their rights is concerned, minority shareholders usually have to accept that they cannot interfere with the overall control of the company due to the limited voting rights and will have to accept the majority decision
 However a majority decision can be unjust especially when a shareholder is the deciding judge

 Companies usually raise capital for their business by debt or equity

 share dhaaran karne se vyakti sambandhit company kaa sadsy ban jaataa he or use company ke samvidhan ke anusaar company evam uske anya sadasyon ke sandarbh main adhikaar praapt hota he
 The share has a face value which indicates the extent of shareholder's liability in repayment of the company's debts in the event of the company's bankruptcy
 share aamtaur par apane dharak ko kuch adhikaar pradaan karata he
 These rights often include the following: bahut si companiyon main vibhinn varg ke share hote hai jo shairdharakon ko alag-alag prakaar ke adhikaar pradaan karte hai
 For example, a company may issue ordinary and preference shares on which voting rights and / or economic rights may be different
 udhaaharan ke liye company aisa praavdhaan kar sakati he ki adhimaan sheyaron ke dharak ko prativarsh ek nishchit raashi kaa sanchayit adhimat labhaansh praapt hoga, jabaki saadhaaran shairdharakon ke liye aisa nahin hoga

 Likewise, most jurisdictions regulate the maintenance of capital and prohibit companies from returning money by distributing it to shareholders in the event that the company is likely to be financially decayed

 However, in some jurisdictions, the regulators have the power to apply for liquidation of the company on the basis of public interest ie where the company is considered to be indulging in illegal conduct or conduct which is harmful to the people as a whole
 svaichhik tarleekaran tab hota he jab company ke sadsy svaichhik rup se company ke kaam-kaaj ko band karnaa chaahate hai
 The reason for this happening may be that they are confident that the company is going to go bankrupt soon or it may have some economic basis if they feel that the purpose for which the company was created was fulfilled
 Or that the company is not getting enough profit on the assets and hence it should be dissolved and sold
 kuch nyaayadhikaron main is baat kii bhi anumati hoti he ki sahi or uchit aadhaaron par companiyon ko bhang kiya ja saktaa he
 Ordinarily, an application for dissolution of companies on the correct and proper grounds should be made by a member of the company who alleges that the business of the company is being conducted in a prejudicial manner and that it is required by the court to terminate the company's existence Request for For obvious reasons, courts in many countries have been reluctant to dissolve companies based on the disappointment of only one member, no matter how good the grounds of the complaint of the member
 Similarly, several jurisdictions that allow dissolution of a company on right and proper basis also allow the court to impose other remedies, such as purchase of shares of depressed minority shareholders by the majority shareholder / shareholders at fair value
