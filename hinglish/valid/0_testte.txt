 Sant Tukaram, also known as Tukaram was a great saint poet of the seventeenth century who was a major pillar of the long-standing devotional movement in India
 tukaraam kaa janm pune jile ke antargat dehu naamak gram main shake 1520; san 1598 main hua
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding his date of birth, and considering it from all angles, birth in 1520 seems to be valid
 purv ke aathven purush vishwambhar baba se inke kul main vitthal kii upasna baraabar chali aa rahi thi
 All the people of his family used to visit Pandharpur regularly
 dehu gaanv ke mahajan hone ke kaaran vahaan inkaa kutumb pratishthit mana jaataa tha
 His childhood was spent under the supervision of mother Kanakai and father Baheba, but when he was 18 years old, his parents died and at the same time due to the famine in the country due to the hunger of their first wife and small child
 Died in agony
 vipattiyon kii ye baaten jhuti hai sant tukaraam us jamaane main bahut bade jamidaar or saavkaar the ye jhute batehai ye likhaawate juthi he jwaalaon main jhulase hue tukaraam kaa man prapanch se ub gaya
 His second wife, brother-in-law, was in great shock
 ye sansaarik sukhon se virakt ho gaye
 With the idea of peace of mind, Tukaram would go to a hill called Bhavnath near Dehu village every day and spend days in remembrance of Lord Vitthal
 prapachaparaduukh ho tanmayata se parameshwar prapti ke liye uthkanthit tukaraam ko baba ji chaitanya naamak sadhu ne magh shuddh 10 shake 1541 main 'ramakrishna hari' mantra kaa swapn main upadesh diya
 After this, he spent 17 years preaching the world equally
 sachche vairaygy tathaa kshamashil ant:karan ke kaaran inaki ninda karanevaale nandak bhi paschataap karte huue inke bhakt ban gaye
 Thus, while teaching everyone of Bhagavata religion and highlighting the path of charity, Tukaram, who denied the iniquity, worshiped Falgun Badi Dwadashi, Ske 1571
 tukaraam ke mukh se samay samay par sahaj rup se parisphutit honevaali 'abhang' vaani ke atirikt inaki anya koi vishesh saahitiyik kriti nahin he
 Nearly 4000 abhagas sung by him in the latter part of his life and written by his disciples are available today
 sant gyaneshwar dwaara likhi gai 'gyaneshravari' tathaa shri ekanath dwaara likhit 'ekanathi bhagwat' ke barkari sampradaywaalon ke pramukh dharmagranth hai
 The impression of this Vandmay is reflected on Tukaram's violations
 tukaraam ne apni sadhak avasthaa main in purvakaleen santon ke granthon kaa gaharaai tathaa shraddha se adhyayan kiya
 The same spiritual thread is threaded in the literature of these three saint-poets, and the intimacy of the transcendental ideas of the three is also consistent
 gyandev kii sumdhur vaani kaavyalankar se mandit he, ekanath kii bhashaa vistrut or rasplavit he par tukaraam kii vaani sutarabaddh, alpakshar, romantic tathaa marmbhedak hai
 Tukaram's abhang vadmaya, being extremely self-possessed, has a complete vision of his charitable life
 kautumbik aapattiyon se trast ek saamaanya vyakti kis prakaar aatmasaakshatkaari sant ban sakaa, iskaa spasht rup unke abhangon main dikhalaai padataa he
 In them, three stages are seen in the form of realization of their spiritual character
 pratham sadhak avasthaa main tukaraam man main kiye kisi nishchayanusaar sansar se nivruth tathaa parmarth kii ore pravruth dikhalaai padate hai
 In the second stage, Tukaram started living in a state of extreme despair after seeing the efforts of God interview failed
 unke dwaara anubhoot is chanam nairashya kaa jo savistaar chithran anbhang vaani main hua hai uski hridayavedhakta marathi bhashaa main sarvatha adwitiya he
 In the darkness of Kinkartavyamudha, the fierce Tamswini, who was tormenting Tukaram Ji's soul, came to an end soon and Tukaram, enlightened by the sun of self-realization, entered into Brahmananda
 unke aadhyatmik jeevanpath kii yah antim evam chirvaanchit safalataa kii avasthaa thi
 In this way, after the completion of the cultivation of Ishvapriya, the sermon that appeared from Tukaram's mouth is very important and meaningful
 swabhaavat: spashtvaadi hone ke kaaran inaki vaani main jo kathorta dikhalaai padati he, uske peeche inkaa pramukh uddeshy samaaj se dushton kaa nirdalan kar dharm kaa sangrakshan karnaa hi tha
 He always followed the truth and continued the work of hypocrisy as well as hypocrisy while not paying attention to anyone's happiness and unhappiness
 dabhik sant, anubhavshoonya potheepandit, duraachaari dharmaguru ityadi samaajakantkon kii unhone atyant teevr aalochana kii he
 Tukaram was a fatalist from the heart, so the picture of the human world depicted by him is crawling with despair, failure and impulse, however he never gave such a sermon to 'renounce the world' for the worldly
 inke upadesh kaa yahi saar he ki sansar ke kshanik sukh kii apeksha parmarth ke shaashvat sukh kii prapti ke liye maanav kaa praytn hona chahie
 Poetically fortunate, so the picture of the human world depicted by him is depressed, failure and impassioned, yet he never gave such a sermon to 'renounce the world' for the worldly
 inke upadesh kaa yahi saar he ki sansar ke kshanik sukh kii apeksha parmarth ke shaashvat sukh kii prapti ke liye maanav kaa praytn hona chahie
 Most of Tukaram's poetry is in the Kabal Abhang verses, however he has also written allegorical works
 sabhi roopak kavy kii drushti se utkrisht hai
 His voice has the wonderful ability to catch the listener's heart as soon as it falls
 inke kaavyon main alankaaron kaa yaa shabdachamatkaar kaa prachurya nahin he
 Their unbroken form are formed
 thode shabdon main mahan arthon ko vyakt karne kaa inkaa kaushal marathi sahitya main adwitiya he
 Tukaram's soulful disguise is also dear to the masses
 iskaa pramukh kaaran he ki saamaanya maanav ke hriday main udbhoot honevaale sukh, du:kha, aashaa, niraashaa, raag, lobh aadi kaa prakatikaran isamen dikhalaai padataa he
 Tukaram's Vadmany has attained the pole position in Janaka's heart
 gyaneshwar, namdev aadi santon ne bhagwat dharm kii pattaaka ko apane kandhon par hi liya tha kintu tukaraam ne use apane jeevankaal hi main adhik unche sthaan par fahraa diya
 He made spiritual science accessible and, while playing the sting of devotion, made such a path of devotion easily accessible to the elderly
 sant tukaraam ne is baat par bal diya he ki sabhi manushya parampita ishwar kii santan hai or is kaaran samaan hai
 The 'maharashtra Dharma' was propagated by Sant Tukaram whose principles were influenced by the Bhakti movement
 maharashtra dharm kaa tatkaaleen saamaajik vichaardhaara par bahut gaharaa prabhaav pana
 Although it did not succeed in fudging caste and varna system, it cannot be denied that its proponents did succeed in making the varna system flexible by rendering the principle of equality
 maharashtra dharm kaa upyog shivaji ne ucchwargeey maraathon tathaa kunbiyon bahujan shudra ko ekasutra main baandhane ke liye kiya

 Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' was born on the Magh Shukla 11, Samvat 1955, 21 February 1899 accordingly, in the Mahishadal princely state of Bengal

 Nirala was educated up to high school

 In the beginning, Nirala got acquainted with the inconveniences and humiliation of his father's small job
 unhone dalit-shoshit kisaan ke saath hamadardi kaa sanskaar apane abodh man se hi arjeet kiya
 The mother died at the age of three and by the age of twenty, the father died

 All his life after this was spent in financial struggle
 niraala ke jivan kii sabase vishesh baat yah he ki kathin se kathin paristhitiyon main bhi unhone siddhant tyagkar samjhaute kaa rasta nahin apanaaya, sangharsh kaa saahas nahin ganvaaya
 The latter part of life was spent in Allahabad
 vahiin daraganj muhalle main sthit raysahab kii vishaal kothi ke thik peeche bane ek kamare main 15 oktober 1961 ko unhone apni igalila samaapt kii
 The first appointment of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' took place in the Mahishadal state itself
 unhone 1918 se 1922 tak yah naukari kii
 He then moved to editing, independent writing and translation work
 1922 se 1923 ke dauraan kolkata se prakashit 'samanvay' kaa sampadan kiya, 1923 ke agast se matvaala ke sampadak mandal main kaary kiya
 He was then appointed to the Ganga Book Mala office in Lucknow, where he remained associated with the institution's monthly magazine Sudha till mid-1935
 1935 se 1940 tak kaa kuch samay unhone lakhanu main bhi bitaayaa
 After this, he lived in Allahabad till 1942 and did independent writing and translation work
 unki pehali kavita janmabhumi prabhaa naamak masik patr main june 1920 main, pehla kavita sangrah 1923 main anamika naam se, tathaa pehla niabandh bang bhashaa kaa uccharan oktober 1920 main masik patrika saraswati main prakashit hua
 Unlike other poets of his contemporary, he has taken little recourse to imagination in poetry and has portrayed reality prominently
 ve hindi main muktchand ke pravartak bhi maane jate hai
 In the role of his poetry collection Parimal published in 1930, he writes - niraala ne 1920 i0 ke aasapaas se lekhan kaary aarambh kiya
 His first composition was a song written on 'janmabhoomi'
 lambey samay tak niraala kii pratham rachana ke rup main prasiddh 'juhi kii kali' sheershak kavita, jiskaa rachanakaal niraala ne swayan 1916 i0 batalaaya tha, vastutah 1921 i0 ke aasapaas likhi gayi thi tathaa 1922 i0 main pehali baar prakashit hui thi
 Apart from poetry, Nirala has written in a tremendous amount in other genres of narrative and prose
 niraala rachanawali naam se 8 khandon main purv prakashit evam aprakashit sampoorn rachanaaon kaa suniyojit prakaashan The greatest feature of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' poetry is the skill of illustration
 aantarik bhav ho yaa bahya jagat ke drishy-rup, sangitatmak dhvaniyaan ho yaa rang or gandh, sajiv charitra hon yaa prakritik drishy, sabhi alag-alag laganevaale tattvon ko ghulaa-milakar niraala aisa jeevant chitra upasthit karte hai ki padhane vaala un chitron ke madhyam se hi niraala ke marm tak pahunch saktaa he
 Nirala's paintings not only contain her emotion, but also her thinking
 isliye unki bahut-si kavitaaon main darshanik gaharaai utpann ho jaati he
 Due to this new illustration skill and philosophical depth, often Nirala's poems become somewhat complicated, which the thinkers accuse them of rigor etc
 as they do not understand
 unke kisaan-bodh ne hi unhen chhayavaad kii bhoomi se aage badhkar yatharthwaad kii nai bhoomi nirmit karne kii prerana di
 Seeing special situations, characters and scenes, recognizing their heart and making those specific objects the subject of illustration is a notable feature of Nirala's realism
 niraala par aadhyatmavaad or rahasyavaad jaisi jivan-vimukh pravritiyon kaa bhi asar he
 Due to this effect, they often dream of conquering miracles and ending conflicts
 niraala kii shakti yah he ki ve chamatkaar ke bharose akarmanya nahin baith jate or sangharsh kii vaastavik chunauti se ankhen nahin churaate
 In some cases, mysticism goes against the unique real life experiences
 har ore prakaash failaa he, jivan alokamay mahaasaagar main dub gaya he, ityadi aisi hi baaten hai
 But this mysticism is not permanent in the sense of the infrequent, it proves to be fleeting
 anek baar niraala shabdon, dhvaniyon aadi ko lekar khilwaad karte hai
 It is difficult to call these players art
 lekin saamanyat: ve in khilvaadon ke madhyam se bade chamatkaarpurn kalatmak prayog karte hai
 The specialty of these experiments is that they are helpful in expressing the subject or emotion more effectively
 niraala ke prayogon main ek vishesh prakaar ke saahas or sajagata ke darshan hote hai
 It is this courage and awareness that makes Nirala different and special among poets of his era

 His father's name was Flight Lieutenant Taralok Singh Sekhon

 He was serving in the Indian Air Force's "the Flying Bullet" 18th Squadron during the 1971 indo-pakistan War

 There was a lot of fog in the airfield

 Nirmal Singh and Ghumman immediately indicated their flight and decided to fly north without waiting ten seconds
 thik 8 bajkar 4 minute par donon vaayu sena adhikari dushman kaa saamana karne ke liye aasmaan main the
 At that time the enemy's first F-86 Saber jet was preparing to dive on the airfield
 air field se pehle ghumman ke jahaaj ne ran ve choda tha
 After that as soon as Nirmaljit Singh's net blew up, a bomb fell just behind him on Runway
 ghumman us samay khud ek sebar jet kaa peechha kar rahe the
 Sekhon faced two Saber jets shaped into the air, one of which was the one that dropped the bomb on the airfield
 bam girane ke baad air field se combat air petrol kaa sampark sekhon tathaa ghumman se tut gaya tha
 The entire airfield was filled with smoke and dust, which was the result of that bombing

 At that time, Flight Commander Squadron Leader Pathania noticed that two airplanes were in an encounter
 ghumman ne bhi is baat kii koshish kii, ki vah nirmalajit singh kii madad ke liye vahaan pahunch saken lekin yah sambhav nahin ho sakaa
 Then the voice of Nirmaljit Singh was heard from the radio communication system


 "main do sebar jet jahaajon ke peeche hoon


main unhen jane nahin doongaa


" a few moments after that, the sound of attack from the net was echoed in Asapan and a Saber jet was seen burning in the fire
 tabhi nirmalajit singh sekhon ne apana sandesh prasaarit kiya


 "i'm on competition and I'm having fun
 mere ird-gird dushman ke do sebar jet hai

 Madhavrao Sapre is one of the earliest Hindi storytellers, a well-known translator and a prominent figure among the earliest editors of Hindi
 ve hindi ke pratham kahani lekhak ke rup main jane jate hai
 Madhavrao Sapre was born in 1871 in Patharia village of Damoh district
 bilaspur main middle tak kii padhai ke baad metric shaskeey vidhyalay raipur se uteern kiya
 After getting his BA from Calcutta University in 1899, he got a government job as Tehsildar, but Sapre ji also showed patriotism and did not care about British government job
 san 1900 main jab samooche chhattisgarh main printing press nahi tha tab inhone bilaspur jile ke ek chote se gaanv pendra se “chhattisgarh mitra” naamak masik patrika nikaali
 However, this magazine only ran for three years
 sapre ji ne lokmaanya tilak ke marathi kesari ko yahan hindi kesari ke rup main chhapana prarambh kiya tathaa saath hi hindi sahityakaron va lekhakon ko ek sutara main pirone ke liye nagpur se hindi granthmala bhi prakashit kii
 He also played a major role in the publication of Karmaveer
 sapre ji kii kahani ek tokari bhar mitti ko hindi kii pehali kahani hone kaa shrey praapt he
 In addition to original writings by Sapreji, Dutt Bhargava, Sri Rama Charitra, in addition to texts like mahabharata-mimamsa composed by the famous saint Samarth Ramdas, originally composed in Marathi, 'dasbodh', Lokmanya Tilak's 'geetarahsya' and Chintamani Vinayak Vaidya
 Translation of Marathi texts, books into Hindi like Eknath Charitra and Atma Vidya was also done well

 And later gradually this art started being used in Hyderabad city of Andhra Pradesh also

 After the Bidri product is made, a layer of oil is applied on it, which deepens its color, which gives a glow to that product and that product looks black and bright

 kavyashastra kavy or sahitya kaa darshan tathaa vigyaan he
 It is a knowledge of theories emerging from time to time based on the analysis of poems
 uganuroop paristhitiyon ke anusaar kavy or sahitya kaa kathy or shilp badalata rahata he; falat: kavyashastreey siddhanton main bhi nirantar parivartan hota rahaa he
 This is illustrated by the historical practice of theories ranging from the principles of Bharata in India to today, and from Socrates and his disciples Plato in the West to the latest "navalochana"
 bharat main kavy naatakadi kritiyon ko 'lakshya granth' tathaa saidhantik granthon ko 'lakshan granth' kaha jaataa he
 These characteristic texts are always retrospective and following the target texts and great poets are seen challenging their rut
 kavyashastra ke liye puraane naam 'sahityashastra' tathaa 'alankarishastra' hai or sahitya ke vyapak rachanaatmak vaaiumay ko sametane par ise 'samikshashastra' bhi kaha jane laga
 Originally poetic thinking is seen to stabilize the theory in relation to the lexicon and the voyeur
 arestu ke "poytics" main kamedi, tragedy, tathaa apik kii samikshatmak kasuti kaa akalan he or bharat kaa naatyashaastra keval roopak yaa drishykavy kii hi samiksha ke siddhant prastut karata he
 This thinking in India and the west BC It is only in the third fourth century that it begins to meet in an adult form, which indicates that discussions about poetry had started many centuries ago
 kavyakruti mulat: tihare aayam se judi he – kavy, kavyakarta, kavyanushilak
 As far as theatrical poetry is concerned, the Natya user Natadi is also included in it along with the poet
 kavyashastreey chintakon kaa dhyaan in sabhi pakshon kii ore sadaa jaataa rahaa he
 The first question that arises in relation to the poet is, what is unique about the poet or artist from other human, preacher, philosopher, scientist, political thinker and why only persons of a particular nature are able to become poets or artists? In other words, what is for poetic power
 sucraat or plato kavitvsakti ko daivi aavesh kii dein maanate hai, adhyayan or abhyaas kaa pratifal nahin
 Poetologists of India consider genius to be predominant in poetry, and do not give any less importance to etymology and practice
 paramparawaadi aalochak keval pratibha ko kavyashakti kaa hetu nahin maanate
 On the other hand, the Romantic thinkers of the West consider the original inspiration of artwork as the only talent
 phir bhi is baat main sabhi chintak ekamat hai ki kavi vishisht pratibhashil vyakti he jo apni pratibha ke madhyam se kavy ke rup main nai sristi kii udbhaavna karata he
 The second important question is, what is the purpose of the poem? Why does a poet of poetry do poetry? There are two groups of thinkers in this regard - the traditionalist thinkers consider the goal or purpose of poetry to be the prestige of moral preaching
 kavy dwaara kavi kinhi mulyon kii sthapana karnaa chahta he, thik usee tarah jaise dharmik upadeshak
 But the difference is that his work becomes distinctive from the scriptures or ethics due to its stylistic delight and delight
 svachhndathawadi chintak ise nahin sweekaarta
 He does not consider the poet a preacher
 uske anusaar kavi sarjak he, srishtikarta he, jo brahma se bhi vishisht he
 He sets before us through his creation, his artwork
 vastut: vah apni anubhutiyon ko kavy ke dwaara vaani dena chahta he
 Poetry is nothing else, the essence of all its sensations and the flow of the swirling emotions in its inner being
 purv or pashchim ke praaia: sabhi matamtantar in do khevon main maje se samete ja sakate hai
 The most important aspect of poetry is the work which, before us, becomes the medium of visual, auditory and intellectual contrivance and through this it affects our mind or nature
 at: kavyashastreey chintan main yah vah pradhan paksh he jiske anek pahaluon ko lekar purv or pashchim ke vichaarak pichley adhaai hajaar varsho se uhapoh karte aa rahe hai
 The first question that arises about the poetry of poetry is how far the events described in the poem match the scientific truth
 yah praaia: sabhi sameekshak sweekaar karte hai ki kavy main tathy-kathan-pranali kaa aashray nahin liya jaataa
 The truth in which it is inaugurated is a probable truth rather than a real truth
 isi aadhaar par kavyavirohi kavi kii kalpana ko bhramit yaa satya se bahut dur ghoshit karte hai
 Plato has proved it to be far from the truth
 bharat ke vichaarkon ne kavyakruti ko bhranti nahin mana hai, yadhyapi ek sthaan par bhatta lollat ne rasasutra kii vyakhya karte hue naatak ke abhinay main ram aadi kaa anukaran karte naton main ram aadi ke bhrantigyaan kaa sanket kiya he
 In the West, in the context of the development of psychology, poetic thinking has strengthened this illusory side
 kaha jaataa he, kala maatr bhranti he 
 Similar to this is another opinion
 kala kuch nahin mahaj sammohan he 
 Here, on the basis of the study of the science of dance, the hypnotic power of poetry is being emphasized and it has emerged that poetry or art has magical effects like the chants of the exorcists of the old primitive society
 yaheen yah sawaal uthta he ki aakhir yah bhranti, sammohan yaa jaadui asar, agar ham puraane vidwaanon ke shabd ko udhaar lenaa chahen to kavy kaa "chamatkaar', kin tatwon ke kaaran paidaa hota he? kavy mulat: bhashaa main nibaddh hota he
 Language is a composite form of word and meaning
 at: pehla sawaal yah uthegaa ki kavy keval shabdamay he yaa shabdarthmay
 Both these views are prevalent with us
 bhamah, kuntak, mammat jaise chintak shabd or arth ke sammilit tatv ko kavy maanate hai, keval shabd ko yaa keval arth ko nahin, kyonki kavy main donon ko ek duusare se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to this view, in order to make poetry wonderful or compelling, the poet will have to give equal emphasis on the elegance of both words and meanings
 doosraa mat kavy kii prabhavanviti main shabd par, arthath uske bauddhik paksh kii apeksha shravan paksh par, adhik jor detaa he
 This is the view of the famous Sanskrit poet Panditraj Jagannath
 yah mat un logon kaa jaan padataa he jo kavy kii lay, shabdachayan, chand or shravan bimbavatta par adhik jor dete hai
 The Romanticist critics of the West, especially the emblematic poets and critics of France, clearly state that poeticism is not made of meaning or thought but by words
 agar is mat kii tulana ham ojhaaon ke nirarthak shabarjaal mantron se karen to pataa chalegaa ki yahan bhi arth kaa koi mahatv nahin, apitu shabdon kii lay, jhaad phunk karanevaale ojha ke mantrocchar kaa lahaza hi rogi ko prabhavit kar manashchikitsa karata kaha jaataa he
 This method is also for psychoanalytic treatment
 kavy ke prabhaav ko paidaa karne main shabd or arth kaa vishesh mahatv mana gaya he, isliye kavyashastreey chintan main shabd or arth ke paraspar sambandh par vichaar karnaa laazmi ho jaataa he
 The word has its intended relation to its traditional meaning
 is sambandh ko hamaare yahan abhidha vyapaar kaha gaya hai
 But in addition to this trade in the language, other trade is also seen to be working, where the word can leave its fixed meaning and also believe in any other meaning related to it, which is known as symptom trade
 arestu ne bhi bhashaa ke in donon vyapaaron kaa vivechan apane prasiddh granth "retorics' main kiya he
 In poetic language, in reality the words are symbolic rather than censorious
 is baat par idhar pashchim main adhikadhik jor diya jane laga he or isaki shuruuaat svachhndathawadi kavi or vichaarak cholorij ne kii thi
 According to him, all poetic language is symbolic
 yah mat ai
e
richards, ampson aadi anya aadhunik kawychintakon ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 According to this opinion, the images, metaphors, symbols and myths in poetry are all the literary processes of the language and not only that, the purpose of poetry verses, rhythm and vocabulary is also purely symbolic
 is mat se miltaa julata mat hamaare yahan dhvanivaadee kavyashastri kaa he jo kavyarthpratiti main lakshana se bhi ek kadam aage badhkar vyanjana kii pariklpana karte hai or kavy ke samast avyavon ko anubhuti yaa rasaroop vyangy kaa vyanjak maanate hai
 On the other hand, the curvilinear Kuntaka also considers the trade of the word and meaning in poetry not as simple designation, as vichitramidha or curvature and specifies the appropriation of this curvature in the verse like verse, verse, sentence, semantics, management
 kuntak ke is vibhaajan kii mul niv vastut: vaaman ke ritivaadee siddhant par tiki he
 By analyzing the composition or structure of poetry, it combines the compelling elements of the organs that affect the listener or reader
 yah vishleshan ek ore vyakaran or bhashashastra se or duusari or kalashastreey chintan se judaa hua he
 Here, the new poetic review of structuralist method which has taken place in America, took the same approach, which has been initiated by Vamana, Anandvardhan and Kuntak in our own way in relation to the discussion of Sanskrit poetry
 niabandh kii seemaa dekhte hue yahan kavy ke vibhinn angon par samay-samay par hue sabhi vichaaron kaa vivechan karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Poetry has basically two sides
 ek he kathyapaksh, jise ham vishaywastu ke vishesh prakaar ke abhidhaan main or usase abhivyakt kalatmak anubhuti yaa rasadi kii aantarik samvednaa main pate hai
 The second is the stylistic aspect of poetry in which the plan of rhythm, verses, vocabulary, qualities and ornamentation is discussed
 in tatwon par purv or pashchim ke vichaarkon ne vistaar se chintan kiya he
 But it has to be understood here that the effect of poetry is overall
 ye sabhi avyav apane apane dhang se us samgr prabhavanviti main yogadan karte dekhe jate hai
 The rhetorical and orthodox critics here do not accept this overall dominant opinion
 ve kavy kaa saundarya yaa chamatkaar shabd arth ke alankaar main yaa vishisht padrachana main maanate hai
 But from the point of view of curvilinear and soundist influences, they carry the totality of poetry, even if they also analyze the metaphysics of it
 pashchim main paramparawaadi sameekshak isi tarah kavy kii samagrata ko prabhaav kii drushti se nahin aankate or kavy main alankaar, uktivaichitrya, durarudh kalpana ko mahatv dete dekhe jate hai
 There has also been a thinker in the second century of Christ who established the principle of this totality of poetry
 longinus ke udaatt sambandhi siddhant kaa mul bhav yahi he
 The Romantic poets and critics of the West also consider the miracle of poetry in its totality and some of the same conceptions of Hindi's chauvinist and post-chauvinist critics
 hamaare yahan alankaar, reeti, vakrokti, ras, dhwani, auchity, chamatkaar jaise vividh kavyasiddhant jo chal pade the, ve sab mulat: kavy kaa saundarya kis ansh main he, isi aadhaar par hai
 Their special discussion will be unnecessary here
 kavi or kavy ke baad teesraa tatv kavy kaa shrota yaa pathak or naatak kaa darshak he jise dhvanivaadee ke shabdon main sahruday kaha jaataa he
 Sahridaya means a person with the same heart, who becomes engaged in it at the time of poetry, becomes a heart like a poet
 uski yah samanhridayata kavy main varnit vishisht patraadi yaa naikadi se bhi hoti he
 To establish this symmetry, Bhatnayak envisioned a simplification trade that Abhinavagupta has accepted
 bharat ke in rasvaadiyon ke anusaar kavyanushilak ke maanas main raag dweshadi rup raj or tam gunon kaa tirbhaav ho jaataa he tathaa satya ke udrek se man ko vishranti kaa anubhav hota he
 Abhinavagupta considers this situation to be similar to the tomb of the yogis
 pashchim main kavy kii aatma ko ras jaise tatv ke rup main maananevaala koi siddhant udit nahin hua he kintu vahaan pichhali sadi main svachhndathawad ke udai ke kaaran yah siddhant viksit hua he ki kavy kaa shrota yaa pathak kavi yaa kavivarnit paatr ke saath samanubhuti yaa sahanubhuti kaa anubhav karata he, jaisi hamen shakespeare ke hamelet yaa makebeth ke saath tathaa style ke promithus ke saath hoti he
 In our own way, psychological analysis of how we reach the logistics is found with Abhinavgupta
 par vah dhaanchaa maatr he
 More recent psychoanalytic research has thrown more light on this aspect
 manovigyaan kii ek vishesh shakha, jisamen sharirkriya ke aadhaar par hamaare snayucentre ke samuttejan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he or shravan, chakshush, sparshan, ghranaj tathaa rasanaj bimbon kaa athwa unki kalpana maatr kaa hamaare mastishk par kaise prabhaav padataa he or usase hamaara maanas kaise andolit hota he, isapar khojein hui hai or hoti ja rahi hai jo kavy or kalakriti kaa kavyanushilak par kaisaa, kyon or kaise prabhaav padataa he, iske vivechan main vyast hai
 It will be clear from the above discussion how wide the field of poetic thinking has become today
 vah ek ore vyakaran, bhashashastra, kalashaastra, darshan or chhandashastra ke chhoron ko choota he, to duusari ore manovigyaan or sharirkriya vigyaan se bhi ja judaa he
 Not only this, when we also start to pay attention to the historical, social motivations of poetry, then the scope of poetry increases further and it also connects with sociology, history and political thought
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj ke kavyashastreey chintan main kai drushtibhangimaayen milengi
 There are some that are steeped in traditionalist Eastern or Western molds, some are associated with the Romantic, Artistic, Dadaist, Futurist or Existentialist theories of the West and some are associated with either Freud's psychoanalytic or Marx's social realist philosophy

 Within a brief kingship during the reign of Babur's son Humayun, he saw the rise of the Afghan Suri dynasty under Sher Shah Suri, an able and skilled ruler in his own right
 haalaanki, sher shah kii asamyik mrityu or unke uttaradhikariyon kii sainya aakshamata ne 1555 main humayun ko apni gaddi hasil karne ke liye sakasham kiya
 However, Humayun died a few months later and his 13-year-old son Akbar succeeded him

 In the 18th century, this empire endured the plunder of raiders such as Nadir Shah of Persia and Ahmed Shah Abdali of Afghanistan, who repeatedly plundered the Mughal capital Delhi
 bharat main is samrajya ke kshetron ke adhikansh bhaag ko british ko milane se pehle marathaon ko parajeet kiya gaya tha
 In 1803, the blind and powerless Shah Alam II formally accepted the patronage of the British East India Company

 Nevertheless, after a few decades, the BEIC continued to rule in the territories under its control as nominal servants of the emperor and in his name, in 1827 this courtesy was also over

 is samrajya ne kalatmak pratibha ke vikaas ke liye ek surakshit dhaancha pradaan kiya or is upmahadweep ke itihaas main adwitiya dhan or sansadhano ko badhaava diya
 The Mughal rulers themselves were exceptional patrons of art, whose intellectual ability and cultural outlook were expressed in the most sophisticated tastes

 The most prominent fruit of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms is the three-dimensional isomerism
 samaavyavi ve yogic hai jinka anusutra ek samaan hota he, par kuch bhautik tathaa rasinic gunon main ve bhinn hote hai
 This variation is due to the variation of the arrangement of atoms within their molecules
 ethil alkohaul or diemethil ether donon kaa anusutra ek hi C2H6O he, par anuon main parmaanuon kaa vinyas bhinn bhinn he
 There are two types of configurational isomerism: one is optical isomerism and the other is geometric isomerism
 prakaashiya samavyawata asamamit hone ke kaaran prakaashat: sakriy hote hai tathaa bahut se rasinic or bhautik gunon main samaan hote hai
 Their most prominent difference is the action with polarized light, because the rotation of these isomers can be equal and counterclockwise
 jyamitiya samaavyaviyon ke rasinic tathaa bhautik gunon main bhinnata hoti he
 The actual study of the early history of the Vinayasarasayana begins with the discovery of some phenomena of light
 1908 i
 main malus ne ghurnan dwaara prakaash ke dhruvan kii khoj kii or teen varsh baad arago ne sphatik ke prakaash-sakriy hone kaa pataa lagaaya
 In 1815, Vio discovered that solids as well as liquids and gases are photosynthetic in a solution
 vishisht ghurnan - kisi prakaashat: sakriy padaarth kaa vishisht ghurnan sameekaran ke dwaara darshaya jaataa he, jise vishisht ghurnan, prakaash kii tarang lambaai l tathaa t degree taap ke liye he or a prakaash ke ghurnan kaa ansh he, jo 1 centi meter lambii nalee se hokar prakaash ke jane se praapt hua tathaa d nalee main bhari hui prakashaskriy vastu kii prati ghan senmi
 sandratha he
 Rightward rotation is called positive and leftward rotation is called negative
 vishisht ghurnan prakaash tarang, lambaai, taap, vilaayak tathaa sandran par nirbhar he
 Sometimes the direction of rotation becomes opposite due to their change
 shele ne 1768 i
 main tarterik amla angooron ke tarter se praapt kiya tathaa 1819 i
 main cestner ne usee sanghatan kaa ek amla upjaat ke rup main paaya or iskaa naam racemic amla rakhaa
 In 1838, Biao discovered that tartaric acid is optically active, and racemic acid is lightly inactive
 dhruvit prakaash tathaa prakaashat: sakriyata kii khoj ke uparaant vinyasarsayan ke siddhanton main ullekhneey pragati paister ke dwaara hui
 Paster discovered that the composition of tartaric and racemic acids and their structure is HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH, but their physical properties differ
 racemic amla, tarterik amla kii apeksha pani main kam viley he tathaa tarterik amla or uske lavan prakaashat: sakriy hai, par racemic amla or uske lavan prakaashat: niskriy hai
 Paster's most famous discovery was on sodium and ammonium salts of racemic acid
 yah lavan jab jal se 22 degree par crystalikrut hota he, to iske cristan duusare recemet se bhinn hote hai or inaki ardhafalakeey falikaay hoti hai
 Two types of crystals are obtained, one is southward like sodium ammonium tartrate and the other is crystals whose opposite properties are opposite
 is duusare prakaar ke crystal ko darpan pratibimb kii sangya di gai
 When they were separated from the mixture, its aqueous solution was counterclockwise
 isse praapt amla kaa crystal bhi tarterik amla ke crystal ke darpan pratibimb ke rup main tha or vilyan bhi vamavart tha
 Therefore, this acid was considered as another form of tartaric acid
 inke crystal asamamit hote hai : It was found that only those crystals and molecules, whose mirror images are not imputed, are lightly activated
 aisi sanrachana ko asamamit kehete hai
 Many substances are lightly activated only in solid state, such as crystalline, sodium chlorate, etc
 sarvapratham gyaat, prakaashat: sakriy padaarth sphatik hi he, jiske crystal do prakaar ke, ek dakshinvart or doosraa vamavart, hote hai
 These two crystals are mirror reflections of each other and do not impose
 crystal ke aise jodon ko pratibimb rup kehete hai
 Its activation disappears when the crystal is smelted
 isliye sphatik kii prakaashat: sakriyata uske asamamit crystal sanrachana ke kaaran hoti he
 Substances of this class remain lightly active only as long as they are in solid form and their activity is destroyed by melting, evaporation and in solution
 bahut se yogic thos, galan, gasiy yaa vilyan avasthaa main bhi prakaashat: sakriy hote hai, jaise glucose, tarterik amla aadi
 Their activation is due to the unmatched molecular structure of the compound
 is anu or uske darpan pratibimb ko pratibimb rup, prakaashiya prativinyasi yaa prakaashiya samaavyavi kehete hai
 Except for only two things, these forms result from one of the physical properties
 ek hi dhruvit prakaash ke saath baraabar or vipareet ghurnan dete hai or duusare dakshinavart tathaa vamavart vrittiya dhruvit prakaash ke saath inkaa avasorana gunank bhinn hota he
 The chemical properties of reflection forms are the same, but there is often a difference in the reaction with another optically active substance
 sharirkriyaatmak sakriyata main bhi antar ho saktaa he, jaise histydin meetha hota he or histydin swadaheen; nicotine nicotine se adhik vishaiylla hota he
 In 1874, Vant Hoff and Le Bal resolved the existence of the apparently isomerism of organic compounds
 waant half ne vichaar kiya ki carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaa kisi samachatushfalak ke chaaron siron kii taraf nirdeshit he or carbon parmaanu us chatushfalak ke madhya main sthit he
 According to this theory, the four hydrogen atoms of methane will be the same, which has also been proved by physical and chemical reactions
 iske purv 1858 i
 main yah samajha jaataa tha ki carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaayen ek samtal main hai or carbon parmaanu is varg ke centre par he
 The four valencies of carbon in the CX4 molecule are the same and it is conceivable that they have a symmetric configuration in the stereoscope
 is prakaar teen vyavastha sambhav ho sakati he - taleey, piramidia or chatushfalkeey
 If the molecule is unilateral, three forms of the compound c abde may be possible
 yadi anu piramidy he, to is yogic ke chah rup sambhav ho sakate hai
 If the molecule is tetrahedral, only two forms of compound c abde will be possible and both will be mirror reflections of each other
 vastav main yogic c a b d e ek jode pratibimb rup main hi praapt hote hai, jo chatushfalkeey anusanrachana kii pushti karte hai
 When all four groups in carbon are different, then such carbon is called asymmetric carbon
 prakaashat: sakriy carbonic yogicon main ek, athwa ek se adhik, asamamit carbon parmaanu avashya rahete hai
 When both the c abde forms of the asymmetric carbon compound change to Ca2 bd, only one optically inactive substance is obtained, such that both the lactic acid clockwise and counterclockwise give the same propionic acid
 isse chatushfalkeey carbon kii pushti hoti he
 Crystalline analysis of the Runtgen ray, dipole base, absorption spectrum and electron diffraction studies also confirm the tetrahedral nature of carbon
 ganitiya gananaa ke dwaara carbon kii kisi do sanyojaktaa ke bich kaa kone 109 degree 28minute nikaala gaya
 It was previously thought that this valence angle is constant, but it is now known that valence may deviate from its location and this angle can also change
 jab carbon parmaanu se sanyojit sabhi chaaron parmaanu yaa samooh ek se hote hai, to yah kone nishchay hi 109 degree 28 minute hota he, jaisaa methen, CH4, yaa carbon tetracloride, ccl4, main he
 But in methylene chloride CH2 Cl2, the angle is found to be 112 degrees, because greater dispersion in the valence angle is possible due to the repulsive force of large atoms of chlorine
 ek asamamit carbon parmanuwale samaavyaviyon main mukhya antar unki prakaashiya sakriyata main he
 The only difference is in the sign of rotation of both reflection forms
 isliye inhen prakaashat: prativinyasi bhi kehete hai
 The molecule of lactic acid, CH3
CHOH
COOH, has only two optically active isomers, which are mirror mirrors of each other
 inhen dectro - or livo - lactic amla kehete hai
 In equal proportions, the mixture of the two forms is lightly inert, because the rotation of the two reflection forms is the same and the direction is opposite
 aise anu anupaati mishran, jo bahyat: pratikaarit tathaa prakaashat: niskriy hote hai, racemic roopaantar kehalaate hai
 Such racemic compounds are directed by r or dl-prefixes
 is prakaar ek asamamit carbon parmaanu vaala yogic teen roopon main praapt ho saktaa he
 The probability of these isomers is dependent on the asymmetric carbon atom
 carbon kii asamamitati nasht hone par prakaashiya sakriyata tathaa samavyawata donon lupt ho jaati hai
 Decomposition of both forms of activated malic acid gives inactive succinic acid, HOOC
CH2
CH2
COOH
 yogicon main jyon-jyon asamamit carbon parmaanuon kii sankhya badhati jaati he tyon-tyon adhik samaavyavi roopon kii sambhaavna badhati jaati he
 In the normal case of an asymmetric compound consisting of the number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the number of optically active isomers can be 2n and 2n-1 will be pairs of reflection forms f, ie 2n racemic forms
 ve yogic, jinamein do bhinn asamamit carbon parmaanu hon 2 x 2 arthath chaar roopon kii kshamta rakhte hai
 These will have two pairs and each pair will have the same and opposite sign rotations
 donon jodon se do racemic rup bhi praapt honge
 Examples of this type are the cinematic acid dibromide, C6H5
 CH Br
 chbr
 COOH is obtainable in four optically active forms and two racemic forms
 yogic, jinamein donon samaan asamamit carbon parmaanu hon, teen vinyason main paae jate hai, jinamein do prakaashat: sakriy pratibimb rup hote hai or teesraa ant:pratikaarit niskriy hota he or inkaa vibhedan prakaashat: sakriy roopon main nahin ho saktaa
 Apart from these, a racemic form also arises from both active forms
 sankhya 3
 dwaara nideshit padaarth prakaashat: niskriy hota he
 Although it has two active carbons, they neutralize each other, as their rotation is the same and opposite
 is ant:pratikaarit anu ko i athwa meso rup kehete hai
 Inactive and undifferentiated forms are not possible in compounds that have the same asymmetric carbon atom
 yah racemic roopon se bhinn hota he, jinka vibhedan unke prakaashat: sakriy roopon main kiya ja saktaa he
 The best example of this type is dihydroxycinic acid, which has two identical asymmetric carbons and which historically has great value
 siddhant ke anusaar yah dakshinvart, vamavart or meso-tartirik amla roopon ke samaan mishran se praapt hota he
 The southward and counterclockwise are optically transient and the meso and racemic are passive
 inke sanrachanasutra nimna rup se darshaae ja sakate hai : An equivalent mixture of a pair of models is called a racemic form
 yah rup nimna kaarnon se praapt ho saktaa he : By mixing both models in equal amounts
 asamamit yogicon ke sanshleshan main racemic rup praapt hota he
 The process of converting a lightly active compound into a racemic form is called respiration
 praaia: yogicon ke + or - roopon kaa rapeemikaran taap, prakaash or rasinic abhikarmakon ke prabhaav se ho saktaa he
 The action of transformation depends on the compound and the reagents
 kuch yogicon kaa rapeemikaran itani saralata or shighrata se hota he ki unako prakaashat: sakriy rup main nahin praapt kiya ja saktaa
 There are some compounds that are not mixed
 vibhedan yah kriya he jisase racemic roopantaran se uske donon pratibimb rup alag kiye jate hai
 In fact, their quantitative separation is very rare and in some there is only one model
 vibhedan kii kuch vidhiyaan is prakaar hai : Mechanical separation - Paster discovered the method by which the crystals of both models are different and can be separated by hand
 paister ne sodium ammonium tarteret ko 28 degree sein
 par crystalikrut kar, donon prakaar ke crystalon ko chimate se alag alag kiya tha
 The use of this method is very limited
 niveshan dwaara varnatmak crystalan - racemic mishran ke atisantrupt vilyan main jab ek pratibimb rup kaa ek crystal daalaa jaataa he, to pehle usee pratibimb rup kaa crystal hota he or is prakaar us rup kaa pruthakkaran ho saktaa he
 Biochemical resolution - When some bacteria or mold grow on a dilute solution of a racemic, they destroy one image form more quickly than the other
 is prakaar kisi nirdisht samay ke uparaant ek pratibimb rup kii prapti ho sakati he
 Penicillium glaucum, when grown on a solution of racemic ammonium tartrate, destroys the first dextro form and the levo survives
 rasinic vibhedan - yah vidhi sabase uttam he
 In this, the reflection forms of the racemic compound are treated with a lightly active compound, so that they combine together to form compounds that can be easily separated
 racemic amlon ko prakaashat: sakriy ksharak ke saath upachaarit karne se jo lavan banenge, unamem kuch lavan +amla tathaa +ksharak ke honge or kuch lavan - amla tathaa +ksharak ke honge
 Their properties may vary, from which they can be separated by crystallization
 varanatmak avasorana - prakaashat: sakriy padaarthon kaa varanatmak avasorana kisi vishesh prakaashat: sakriy avasorak dwaara ho saktaa he
 Many chemists have done the differentiation by this
 pehle dakshinavart or vamavart pratibimb roopon ko kramash: dactro or livo upsargon se nirdeshit kiya jaataa tha
 Similarly, it was called factory tartaric and levo tartaric acid
 waantahof ne + or - chinhon kaa prayog asamamit carbon ke vinyas ko darshane ke liye kiya he
 Fisher later proposed that the prefixes d and l be used for their configuration position and not to be used for the direction of rotation
 kisi prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke ghurnan kaa chinh praaia: praayogic dasha main parivartan se vipareet ho saktaa he or isi bhaanti unke sanjaton kaa, jinka vinyas usee prakaar he, chinh bhi ghurnan kii disha se vipareet ho saktaa he, jaise vamavart lactic amla ke lavan or aster dakshinavart hote hai or dakshinavart lactic amla ke vamavart
 For all these reasons, it was considered that for lightly active matter such a mark should be used which directly indicates the position of the configuration and this mark is independent of its mark of rotation direction
 glissraldihide, jisamen ek asamamit carbon parmaanu he, do pratibimb roopon main prapya he or ek swaichh nishchay ke anusaar dakshinavart rup ko aise darshaate hai ki hydraxil, -OH, samooh kaa carbon daahine or hydrogen parmaanu vaain taraf hota he
 According to the arrangement of tetrahedral carbon, the hydrogen and hydroxyl groups are above the surface of the surface and the -CHO and -CH2OH groups are below the surface of the surface
 glissraldihide ke is vinyas ko d kehete hai
 According to popular practice, the group connected by a horizontal line is above the surface of the page
 is bhanti iske pratibimb kii dasha kaa sanket hai
 The configurations related to the authentic configuration of this D-glyceraldehyde fall under the D-class, ie compounds that can be derived from D-glyceraldehyde, or can be converted to D-glyceraldehyde by chemical reaction, into the D-range
 Come
 is tarah glissraldihide kaa puraa naam d glissraldihide or l glissraldihide hota he
 And indicate its rotation direction
 inke eldihide samooh ko agle sajaateey - CHOH - CHO main badla ja saktaa he or jaise ki isamen ek asamamit carbon he vaise hi har glissraldyhide do rup denge
 In carbon compounds, when one group is replaced by another group, it is understood that the substituent replaces the removed group
 yadi ek prakaashat: sakriy yogic a saadhaaran pratisthaapan abhikriya se ba yogic main parivartit hota he, to inke vinyas ek se hote hai
 This is true, but sometimes the configuration changes as well as replacement
 is vinyas parivartan ko prakashkeey pratilomon, yaa avishkaarak wolden ke naam se walden pratilomon kehete hai
 a simple example of this is the substitution of chlorine in chloroxynic acid from the hydroxyl group, malic acid is obtained and southward acid is obtained using potassium hydroxide
