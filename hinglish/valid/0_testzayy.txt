 No matter what the nature of communication, each communication system has three essential elements - the sender, the medium / channel and the receiver
 kisi sanchaar vyavastha main preshitr kisi ek sthaan par avasthit hota he
 The receiver is located somewhere else and the channel is a physical medium that connects them to each other

 jab koi preshit signal channel ke anudish sanchaarit hota he to yah channel main apurnataa ke kaaran viroopit ho saktaa he
 Additionally, the transmitted signal receives noise, consequently the receiver receives a distorted form of the transmitted signal
 abhigrahi kaa kaary praapt signal ko prachaalit karnaa hota he
 It reconstructs this information-signal and makes it recognizable to the original message-signal so that the message can be delivered to the recipient
 sanchaar ke do mul dhang he: bindu se bindu tak sanchaar, tathaa prasaaran
 In point-to-point communication, communication takes place through a combination between a single sender and a receiver

 In contrast, the broadcast method has many recipients corresponding to a single sender

 If we become familiar with the following basic terminology, then it will be easy to understand any communication system
 koi yukti jo urja ke ek rup ko kisi duusare rup main parivartit kar detii he use transdusar kehete hain
 In electronic communication systems, we often have to deal with such devices which are either in the form of input or output
 kisi vidyutiya transdusar ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya jaataa he- aisi yukti jo kuch bhautik charon ko apane nirgat par tadnurupi vidyutiya signal ke charon main roopantarit kar dete hain
 Transformed information into an electrical form suitable for transmission is called a signal

 yahan ke nivaasiyon ne 1857 ke viplav main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Chief revolutionaries among them were - Chaudhary tremendous Khan and Chaudhary Ulfat Khan
 britaniyon ke viruddh kranti main sanlagn hone ke kaaran choudhary jabardast khan evam choudhary ulfat khan ko unke samarthakon ke saath mrityudand diya gaya
 But the residents of Hapur still remember their martyrdom
 hapur main 1857 main shahid hone vaale krantikariyon kii yaad main 1975 i
 se prativarsh shahid meley kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 Which starts from May 10 and lasts for a month
 sampoorn desh main 1857 se sambaddh is prakaar ke meley kaa aayojan anyatra kahin nahi kiya jaataa
 Chaudhary Jatir Khan's family was originally from the village of Asauda, who, due to their zamindari, later resided in Hapur's Muhalla Bhanda Patti
 choudhary jabardast khan, samast khan, ulfat khan, amjad khan, duulhe khan sahit saat bhai the, ek bahin bhi thi
 There was a friendly relationship between Nawab Walidad Khan of Malagarh and Chaudhary Zahit Khan
 "nawab validaad khan ke putr kii shaadi nawab mujffarnagar kii iklauti putree ke saath hui thi
 The procession left from Malagarh for Muzaffarnagar
 hapur raste main hone ke kaaran baraat yahan se hokar jaani thi
 On coming here, Nawab Walidad Khan sent Chaudhary tremendous Khan as the head of the procession and returned himself
 is ghatana se donon ke madhya dostana sambandhon kii pushti hoti hai
 The Nawab Muzaffarnagar gave a grand welcome to the procession and Chaudhary Jatri Khan
 baraat do maah se adhik samay tak nawab mujffarnagar ke yahan ruki rahi, jo vyakti baraat kii soochna praapt karne jate unhen bhi vaapis nahin aane diya jaataa, is kaaran baratiyon kii sankhya kaaphi adhik ho gayi
 In place of Nawab Validad, Chaudhary tremendous Khan performed the responsibility of the groom's father
 nawab mujffarnagar kii putree iklauti thi isliye nawab ne apni sampoorn jaaydaad apni ladki evam damaad ke superd kar di
 " hamaara anumaan he ki validaad khan kisi gupt evam ati mahatv ke kaary main lage hone ke kaaran putr kii shaadi main na ja sake honge or yah bhi ki yah kaam pehle se nirdhaarit nahin rahaa hoga balki achaanak lag gaya hoga
 If this particular work had been foreseen, the Nawab could have withdrawn the date of Validad Shah
 saath hi kaary itane adhik mahatv kaa hoga ki shaadi ke ain vakt par ve na to shaadi taal sakate the or na hi kaam ko wilimbit kar sakate the
 Finally, the question arises what exactly was this work? We believe that this work, and nothing else, must have been related to its plan or its planners before the revolution of 1857
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon main sakshya samooh isi anumaan ko bal pradaan karata he ki shaadi kaa samay 1857 kii basant ritu ke aas-paas hoga
 By considering this one can easily guess
 itihaaskaar is par ekamat hai ki 10 may 1857 ko meerut se achaanak kranti prasphutit hui thi
 Therefore, it would not be evidenced that its eruption has a prior perception to Validad Khan
 atah saralata se is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ja saktaa he ki shaadi kii tithi 10 may se kuch purv nahokar hi kaaphi pehle rahi hogi
 On assuming this, father Validad Khan, instead of wasting precious time in his son's wedding, would have thought it appropriate to contact the planners and discharge their role in the revolution
 nawab validaad khan ek doordarshee vyakti the
 Contemporary historical sources confirm this
 1857 ke samay nawab validaad khan kaa malagarh riyasat main shashan tha tathaa mughal darbar main unhen vishesh sthaan praapt tha
 At the time of revolution, Emperor Bahadur Shah also handed over to him the responsibilities of Bulandshahr, Aligarh and adjoining areas
 1857 main mughal badshaah dwaara krantikariyon kaa saath dene ke kaaran validaad khan ne bhi unka saath diya tathaa angrejon ke viruddh apane kshetra kaa netritv kiya
 Chaudhary Zahir Khan, having close ties with Nawab Walidad Khan, fully supported the rebellion and led the revolutionary villagers of Hapur on a regional basis
 hapur tehsil main kai maah tak markat machi rahi
 The revolutionaries cut all the telephone wires between Hapur and Bulandshah
 validaad khan or jabardast khan ne hapur main britaniyon par akraman karne kii yojana banaayi lekin britaniyon ke samarthakon ev bulandashahar jile main bhatona gaanv ke jaaton ke kaaran yah yojana kriyanvit na ho saki
 Williams was eventually accompanied by a powerful British contingent to halt the increasing activities of revolutionaries in Hapur
 usne hapur ke angrej adhikari wilson kii sahaayta se choudhary jabarast khan tathaa unke bhai ulfat khan ko anek samarthako sahit giraftaar kar liya
 Many revolutionaries went away from Hapur
 angrej adhikariyon ne choudhary jabardast khan tathaa choudhary ulfat khan sahit unke anek samarthakon ko vidrohi ghoshit karte hue mrityudand kaa aadesh diya
 All the people, who were hanged near the old tehsil in Hapur, were cut in time
 usee vriksh ke sthaan par aaj hapur kaa telephone axenge bana hua he
 Its wall is adjacent to the Tehsil wall
 yah hapur main bulandashahar road par sthit he
 At that time, the silk cord was hanged
 aisa mana jaataa he ki choudhary jabardast khan ko teen baar phaansi lagaayi gayi parantu teenon baar hi phaansi kaa fanda tut gaya
 Seeing this, the British officer Wilson expressed surprise and made up his mind to leave the overwhelming Khan alive
 choudhary jabardast khan ko phaansi ke takhte se utaar liya gaya or unke pani maangane par pani pilwane kaa aadesh bhi diya
 But the opponents of overwhelming Khan did not want him to be left alive
 unhone british adhikari se prarthana kii, ki agar choudhary jabardast khan ko jivit chhod diya gaya to vah hamen jinda nahin chhodega
 Because he had helped the Britishers against the Chaudhary Tremendous Khan during the revolution, Wilson accepted his request
 jab jabardast khan pani pi rahe the tab unhone uski canapati par goli maar di
 Chaudhary became a martyr for the tremendous Khan country
 unki sampoorn jaaydaad jabt karne tathaa parivaar ke anya sadasyon ko mrityudand kaa aadesh bhi british adhikari ne diya
 Abdullah Khan and Wadulla Khan, who are said to be the sons of Chaudhary tremendous Khan, took away one of their loyal servants away from Hapur and after several years they returned when Hapur was peaceful
