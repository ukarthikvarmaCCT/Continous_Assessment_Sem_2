 BMW is proposed to produce 49 models with the EU5 / 6 pollution emission standard and around 20 models emitting less than 140 g / km of CO2, which will be the lowest tax group and therefore in some European states as its future owners
 For this it will be like an eco-bonus

 In the US, experts are of the opinion that the Beemer should only be used for BMW motorcycles and the Bimmer is used only to refer to BMW cars; This should be done in such a way that "true imitators" appear and avoid looking "identical"

 When the larger 'X' Harf was added to the series number, it was known as the BMW Sports Activity Vehicles featuring the BMW xdrive
 'Z' ko do siton vaale vaahan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In the 'M' version of 'Z' models, 'M' is added as a suffix or prefix, depending on which country it is to be sold
 
 In previous x and z vehicles, the engine displacement number is followed by 'i' or 'si'
 BMW is now setting standards for globally defined terminology for its x and z vehicles, followed by two numbers followed by 'sdrive' or 'xdrive', which represent the vehicles' engines

 This type of reproduction is called parthenogenesis
 kuch jatiyon main yah ek anuthi or kabhi kabhi honevaali ghatana hoti he, tathaa kuch shalbhon main asansechit andon se nar or maadaa donon hi utpann hoti hai
 In social bees, parthenogenesis is most frequent, but only males are produced from undigested eggs
 kuchhek stick kiton main asansechit andon se adhiktar maadaa hi utpann hoti hai or nar bahut hi kam
 Males may not have originated in safilis, hence it cannot be impregnated
 falat: keval anishekajanan hota he
 In Drumayuca there is cyclic parthenogenesis, that is, the production of undigested and coagulated eggs is done according to the rules
 kuchhek jatiyon main apapikv keet bhi janan karte hai
 This phenomenon is called pedogenesis
 miester keet ke dimbh anya dimbhon kaa utpaadan karte hai or is prakaar kai peedi tak utpaadan hota rahata he
 After this, some of these ovules become enlarged to become adult males and females, which produce ovum after intercourse
 in dimbhon se pehle kii bhaanti phir utpaadan aarambh ho jaataa he
 Meaning of multiplicity
 ek andey se ek se adhik kiton kaa utpann hona
 This type of production is found in parasitic art forms
 platigastor himelis ke kuch andon main se do dimbh utpann hote hai, kintu kisi kisi parashrayi calcid ke prayek andey se lagbhag ek sahasr tak dimbh utpann ho jate hai
 In some insects, copulation occurs only once
 tatpashchaat mrityu ho jaati he, jaisaa affimeroptera gana ke kiton main
 Although the queen of the bee lives for many years, intercourse occurs only once, and at one time sufficient quantities of sperm are reached to impregnate its eggs throughout life
 maithun ke pashchaat nar kii sheeghra hi mrityu ho jaati he
 Many insect males copulate with isolated females multiple times in their lives, and both male and female copulate repeatedly with many castes
 andey saadharantaya bahut chote hote hai
 Nevertheless, it is often possible to tell the egg which kind of insect will emerge from the egg
 bahudhaa yah baat bahut mahatv rakhti he, kyonki isse hanikaarak kiton kii hanikaarak dasha ke vishay main bhavishyavaanee kii ja sakati he

 It can lay one egg per second and lays 10,00,000 eggs in its six to twelve years of life
 andey ke sansechan ke pashchaat parivardhan aarambh ho jaataa he
 Initially a two-legged root band or germ band is formed, which is divided into twenty eggs by transverse lines
 agle chah khand sir, parvarti teen khand vaksh or shesh khand telson ke saath milakar udar banaate hai
 In addition to the first segment and the telson, a paired embryonic component develops in each segment
 avyavon ke pratham yugma kaa sambandh dwitiya khand se rahata he or inase shringikas banati hai
 The second pair is very short and transient
 teesri, chauthi or paanchavi jodi ke avyav viksit hokar mandible, mexila or labium ban jate hai
 The three pair of components behind them are somewhat large and clear
 ye taangon ke agravarti he
 The last pair of abdominal components become sarsai, but all the remaining pairs are usually destroyed before they reach the ovum
 andey se baccha nikalnaa-bhrun jab purna reeti se viksit ho jaataa he or andey se baahar nikalne ko taiyaar hota he, tab shukti main pehle se bani hui topi ko apane anda phodne vaale kaanton se hataakar baahar nikal aata he
 Initially in some insects, the fetus swallows air and increases its expansion so much that the secretion is broken
 bachche ko baahar nikalne main uski peshiyaan sahaayta karti hai
 Growth begins only after hatching
 janm se praudhata tak keet ke aakaar main jo vruddhi hoti he vah atyadhik aashcharya janak he
 The adult insect weighs between 1,000 and 70,000 times the birth weight
 itani adhik vruddhi aise khol ke bheetar, jiskaa vistaar bad nahin saktaa, nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, breaking of the shell is very important
 yah kentul ke patan se hi sambhav he
 Chronic externality is called snakeskin
 jeern bahyatvak ke fatne se purv hi iske bhitaravaale adhicharm kii koshikaaye naveen bahyatvak kaa utsarjan kar detii hai
 Then some of these special types of cells, which are called snake glands, produce a fluid substance

 At such a time, the insect grows
 kentul patan ke pashchaat keet kii akruti ko instar kehete hai
 When the insect comes out of the egg, the first instar occurs, after the first snake fall the insect is the second instar, the last instar is called the complete insect or adult insect
 adhiktar kiton main andey se jo dimbh nikalataa he uski akruti or rup vayask keet se bahut bhinn hota he
 Many insects undergo many changes until they become mature in shape and form

 Parasites are pests that subsist on other organisms, but receive food from them without killing them and often depend on the same nutrient
 ye apane andey praaia: apane poshak ke sharir par dete hai
 There are two types of parasitic insects - one that survives on vertebrates and the other on insects and their relatives
 pratham varg ke keet anoplura, mellophayga or cyphonaptera ganon tathaa hippobosidi vansh ke antargat aate hai
 These parasites are very small compared to their nutrient
 poshak main inako sahane karne kii shakti viksit ho jaati he or is kaaran inkaa prabhaav prananashak nahin hota
 Most of these are excellent parasites and live on the body of the nutrient
 cyphonaptera ke atirikt anya kaa sharir upar neeche se chauras hota he or ye poshak ke sharir se chipke rahete hai
 They have hooks to hold the nutrient on their feet and the eyes become weak or fading
 pakshon kaa bhi praaia: abhaav rahata he or yadi ve hote bhi he to bahut chote hote hai
 There are only a few parasites of insects
 strepsyptus gana ke atirikt madhumakhi kii juun, breula hi keval inkaa anya udhaaharan he
 The behavior of semi-parasites is similar to that between parasitic and parasitic
 aarambh main yah paraseete kii tarah rahata he, arthath poshak kii ati aavashyak indriyon ko nasht nahin karata, kintu baad main iskaa vyavhaar apahari jaisaa ho jaataa he or yah apane poshak kaa bhakshan kar jaataa he
 It usually lays its eggs above or inside the body of the nutrient
 iske dimbh poshak se sthaayee rup se chipke rahete he or apana bhojan poshak ke sharir ke bheetar yaa baahar se praapt karte hai
 Mostly these insects are found only in the Tachinidis of the bipedal lineage and in the Parasitica class of the genus Aap
 inke praudh kriyasheel hote hai or parashrayi nahin hote
 The size of a semi-parasite is larger than the size of a nutrient and by its behavior it always destroys the nutrient
 poshak adhiktar anya keet hi hote hai, jinke andon yaa anya apraudh avasthaaon par ardhparasite kaa akraman hota he
 Adult pests are never attacked
 texnidi vansh ke keet poshak ke bheetar rahete hai, kintu andey poshak ke upar, yaa poshak se dur, rakhte hai
 Many parasites are like external parasites, but most are internal parasites and lay their eggs within the skin of the nutrient

 Social insects of different classes have different traits, but the most important feature of each of their congregations is that there is only one family, consisting of a male, a female and their offspring, or a mating female and its offspring
 , Ie, at least two generations live together in one place
 vaastavik saamaajik jivan bara, madhumakhiyon, chitiyon or dimakon main paaya jaataa he
 
 ek anya prakaar kaa sahjivan he jisamen ek keet duusare keet ke sharir par chipka rahata he
 The insects that stick on the body are usually large, but small insects do not eat them, that is, they do not cause any harm
 miloidi vansh ke triangulin dimbh ko saamaajik kalapaksh apane sharir par apane ghonslen main le jate hai
 These eggs eat their offspring there
 silionidi vansh ke kuch paraseete, maadaa tiddon kii peeth par, baith jate hai
 The grasshoppers lay on their backs until they lay eggs

 Insects have incomparable distribution power, which is not found in other terrestrial organisms

 Oil pests, rice truncated insects, pulses pests etc
 are famous among insects found in the houses of humans all over the world
 inke atirikt aajkal chane kaa shalab, aalu k shalab, shakarkand kaa suundwala keet or bandgobhi kaa shalab, bhi saare sansar main paae jate hai
 Similarly, there are many such pests that are found only in a particular state or country
 aisa vitaran bahut si paristhitiyon par nirbhar rahata he
 Feeding and natural conditions are undoubtedly very effective conditions
 jalawaasi keet vahaan nahin rah sakate jahaan jal nahin he
 Insects living in the bark of trees cannot be found in places where there is no tree

 The insect called Spring Tail is found in New Zealand and Chile
 isse yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi kaal main in donon deshon ke bich atactic mahadweep failaa hua tha, kyonki yah keet itnaa komal or pakshaheen he ki iskaa anya kisi prakaar se vitaran ho hi nahin saktaa
 Spring tail has the most extensive distribution compared to other insects and due to this it has adapted itself to these different conditions

 The Bear, in 1954-55, stated that the eggs of Miriapoda who can breed in the embryo should be considered as ancestors of insects
 yah siddh karne ke liye kiton ke praudh or kuch miriapoda ke dimbhon kii, udaahranarth, aiulas kii, jo ek milipid he, tulana karne main mahatpurna hai
 When the egg of the ileus emerges from the egg, its head appears to be composed of as many segments as the head of the insect
 sharir ke shesh bhaag main lagbhag 12 khand hote hai, jinamein se pratham teen khandon main prayek par ek jodi taange hoti hai
 Fourth and the sections behind them are also without legs
 kintu inke parivardhan main rukaawat aa jaati he or ye bahut hi chote rah jate hai
 In this way, the ovum of this six-legged ileus becomes a long adult at the end, which has many segments and many legs in the body
 yadi is dimbh kii pratham teen jodi ke pashchaatwali taangon ke parivardhan main adhik rukaawat ho or dimbh ke sharir ke lagbhag 12 khand praudhavastha main drudh rahen to yah jeev keet ke aakaar kaa hoga, jisamen pratham teen jodi taangon ke pechhevali taange yaa to itani ksheen hongi ki keval unke avshesh hi honge yaa ve sarvatha lupt hongi
 It is very interesting that in fact there are pests in which even the remains of the legs are present on the abdomen, such as Campodia, Japix and Matilis
 in kiton ke paksh nahin hote or inamen ve rachanaaen vartmaan rahati hai jo anya kiton main lupt ho gai hai, jaise janangranthiyon kaa khandibhavan
 Therefore, in the development of insects, these insects should understand the mid stage condition of the eggs and other insects born in the brain of Miriapoda
 anya anek tarkon se bhi yah anumodith hota he ki miriapoda kii tarah kii akritiyon se hi kiton kii utpatti hui he
 It is highly likely that myriapoda are the ancestors of insects in all those long-bodied and tangled organisms, because they contain many of the same creations, for example, malpigian tubules and tracheal tubules
 kintu iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki kiton kii utpatti praudh miriapoda se nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki inamen bahut si visheshtaayen or vilakshantaayen hai
 The Aperigota subclass is a group of mostly diverse insects and only the Thysanurae ganas of that subclass are probably close to the main category of growth of Terrigote insects
 aisa tark dwaara siddh kiya gaya he ki aptarigota ke shesh teen ganon ko keet maananaa hi nahin chahie
 However, there does not seem to be any satisfactory reason to separate these three ganas from this subclass, although there is no doubt that they exhibit unique compositions, for example the pests of Collenbola gana have only nine segments
 protura gana ke kiton main enamorphosis hota he, diplura, gana ke kiton main alakshanik trekial tantra paaya jaataa he, diplura or colembala kii shringikaaon ke kashabh main peshiyaan hoti hai
 The subclass Terrigota is divided into two parts - exopterigota and endopterigota
 exopterigota ganon ke affimeroptera or odoneta main paraspar nikat sambandh he, kyonki ye donon hi peliapteron, gana hai
 Blatteria, Mantodia, Isoptera, Joreptra, Gyloblatodia, Rhe Jupaj, Phaseamidea, Plicoptera, Dermaptera and Ambioptera r Jupaxica orthopteraid belong to the community, if considered from the body theory of modern insects
 nimnlikhit lakshanon ke kaaran ye sab gun ek samudaay banaate hai-aparivartit mukhbhaag, pashchapaksh main vishaal anelle lob udar ke pasch sire par ek jodi sarasai, aganit mailipagian nalikaayeor pratiprishth tantric tantu main kai ek pruthak-pruthak gucchhikaayen
 Of these Ganas, Blatteria and Mantodia have a very close relationship, placing them both together under Dictyoptera
 exopterigota ke shesh gana, jinke naam hai socoptera, mellophayga, simonculeta, matkunagan or jhallaripaksh, matkunaganik samudaay ke antargat aate hai
 The characteristics of the Mtkunganik community are as follows: special types of mandibulate or sucking mouth, anel lobes not found in the posterior side, lack of sarsai
 malepigian nalikaaon kii sankhya bahut thodi hoti he or pratiprishth tantriktantu kii gucchhikaaye lagbhag ekatribhoot ho jaati he
 There are no clear distinctions between the rheumatic and the mitochondrial communities, as the side veins in the Joraptera are somewhat weakened, the number of mallepigian tubules is even smaller, and the neoplasms are also slightly dilated
 socoptera or mellophayga main spasht sambandh prathit hota he, kyonki donon main vilakshan prakaar kaa hypofarics hota he
 Probably Cyphonculata is closely related to Malophaga
 inase ve keval anek bahya or aantarik rachanaaon tathaa prakruti main hi saadrishy nahin rakhte, apitu shwasaradhran kii rachana or andey se bachche nikalne kii vidhi main bhi saadrishy he
 Now the question arises as to why both lice of lice are not considered under the same gana
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki donon ganon ke mukhbhaagon main itnaa adhik antar hota he
 That it is often considered appropriate to keep them separately in different ganas
 indopterigot kiton ke vishay main dhyaan de to kalapaksh, strepciptera or kanchukpaksh ko anya ganon ke saath rakhane main atyadhik kathinata upasthit hoti he, at: inke atirikt shesh sab gana panorapid samudaay ke antargat rakhe gaye hai
 The panorepid community is centralized on the mykaptera with the laminae neuroptera and forms a few distinct microbial branches
 aisa adhik sambhav he ki micoptera ke nimnasth sadasyon se ek ore dwipaksh or duusari ore shalki paksh or lomapaksh kii utpatti hui ho
 The adults of Siphonaptera are very different in composition, but its ovum is not different from some of the ovules of the bipedal Nematosera, and if Siphonaptera did not originate from the primordial bipedes, it would have at least been from the Panorapid community
 kalapaksh, kanchukpaksh or strepciptera ke vishay main bhi kuch kathinata prathit hoti he
 The subalpine of the acupuncture is conspicuous in the ovum of the symphyta and the ovum of the panorepid insects, as well as the origin of the vein on the sides of the symphyta appears to be from the megalopteran pattern, without difficulty
 in do kaarnon se aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki kalapaksh ke purvaj tathaa jaalpaksh or anya panorapid ganon ke purvaj ek hi the
 There is a view of the Kunchuk side that they originated differently from other Indopterigot
 kintu kuch lekhakon kaa aisa anumaan he ki kanchukpaksh kii utpatti jaalpaksheeya akritiwale purvajon se hui
 Strepsiptera are often thought to be related to the sciatica, but some authors determine their relationship to the genitive

 If truth be told, Palika cannot be written schematically

 We can also call Palika as a short poem
