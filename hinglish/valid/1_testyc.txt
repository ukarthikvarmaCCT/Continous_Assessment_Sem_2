or unke uttar die jate hai
 This is called the 'question Hour'
 iske atirikt, khoji or anupoorak prashn poochne se mantriyon kaa bhi pareekshan hota he ki ve apane vibhaagon ke kaarykaran ko kitna samajhate hai
 The Question Hour is the most interesting part of the proceedings of Parliament
 logon ke liye samachar patron ke liye or swayan sadasyon ke liye koi anya kaary itani dilchaspee paidaa nahin karata jitani ki prashnkaal paidaa karata he
 The atmosphere of the house during this period is uncertain
 kabhi achaanak tanaav kaa bavandar uth khadaa hota he to kabhi kahkahe lagane lagate hai
 Occasionally a question arises from a bitter argument
 aisi haalat sadasyon yaa mantriyon kii hajir-javaabi or vinodpriyata se dur ho jaati he
 This is the reason that during the Question Hour not only the House Room but also the audience and press galleries are almost always full
 kuch prashnon kaa maukhik uttar diya jaataa he
 These are called starred questions
 atarankit prashnon kaa likhit uttar diya jaataa he
 It can be said with certainty that members have been showing great interest in exercising their right to ask questions
 chunki prashnon kii prakriya apekshtah saral or aasaan he
 Therefore, it is becoming more and more beloved among Members of Parliament than other measures of parliamentary procedure
 sansad ke donon sadanon main prashnkaal ke thik baad kaa samay aamtaur par ‘shoonyakaal’ athwa jiro aavar ke naam se janaa jane laga he
 It is zero in more than one sense
 12 baje dopaher kaa samay na to madhyahn purv kaa samay hota he or na hi madhyahn pashchaat kaa samay
 'zero Hour' is also known as 'hour' due to its commencement at 12 o'clock because earlier 'zero Hour' used to run for a full hour, that is, until the house was recessed for dinner at 1 o'clock in the day
 yah koi nahin kah saktaa ki is kaal ke dauraan koun-sa maamla uth khadaa ho yaa sarkaar par kis tarah kaa akraman kar diya jaae
 There is no mention of 'zero time' anywhere in the rules
 prashnkaal ke samaapt hote hi sadsygan aise maamle uthaane ke liye khadey ho jate hai jinke bare main ve mahasoos karte hai ki kaarywahi karne main deree nahin kii ja sakati
 However, there is no provision in the rules for raising the case thus
 aisa prathit hota he ki is pratha ke peeche yahi vichaar rahaa he ki aise niyam jo rashtriya mahatv ke maamle yaa logon kii gambhir shikayaton sambandhi maamle sadan main turant uthaae jane main sadasyon ke liye baadhak hote hai, ve nirarthak hai
 In terms of rules, the so-called 'zero time' is an irregularity
 maamle chunki bina anumati ke yaa bina purv soochna ke uthaae jate hai atah isse sadan kaa bahumoolya samay vyarth jaataa he
 This leads to encroachment of legislative, financial and other routine work of the House
 ab to shoonyakaal main uthaaye jane vaale kuch maamalon kii pehle se di gai soochna ke aadhaar par, adhyaksh kii anumati se, ek suchi bhi banane lagi he
 The rules of both the Houses of Parliament provide for raising matters of public importance without delay and in many ways
 jo vibhinn prakriyaayein prayek sadsy ko uplabdh rahati hai ve is prakaar hai: By this, the matter of immediate importance can be discussed by stopping the regular work of the Lok Sabha
 iske dwaara koi bhi sadsy sarkaar kaa dhyaan tatkaal mahatv ke maamle kii or dilaa saktaa he
 The minister has to give a statement in that case
 dhyanakarshan karne vaale prayek sadsy ko ek prashn poochne kaa adhikaar hota he
 They can discuss questions of immediate importance for one hour
 haalaanki is par matdaan nahin hota
 How our elected representatives try to raise matters which have no relation to the interpretation of rules and regulations
 lekin ye maamle us samay unhen or unke nirvachan kshetra ke logon ko uttejit kar rahe hote hai
 The matters which are not questions of the system or which cannot be raised under the rules related to questions, short notice questions, call attention proposals, etc
, are raised under it
 sadan lok mahatv ke vibhinn maamalon par anek faisle karata he or apni raay vyakt karata he
 Any member can put a suggestion before the House in the form of a resolution
 jisamen uski raay yaa ichha di gai ho
 If the House accepts it then it becomes the opinion or wish of the entire House
 ant: mote taur par ‘prastaav’ sadan kaa faisla jaanane ke liye sadan ke saamne laayaa jaataa he
 The proposals are actually the basis of parliamentary proceedings
 lok mahatv kaa koi bhi maamla kisi prastaav kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 Proposals may be offered by different members for different purposes
 prastaav mantriyon dwaara pesh kiye ja sakate hai or gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon dwaara bhi
 The purpose of the proposals presented by non-government members is usually to know the opinion or views of the government on a matter
 sankalp bhi ek prakriyaagat upaay he yah aam logon ke hit ke kisi maamle par sadan main charchaa uthaane ke liye sadasyon or mantriyon ko uplabdh he
 Resolutions can be in the form of a declaration of opinion, or recommendation, similar to resolutions of the general form
 yaa kisi aise anya rup main ho saktaa he jaisaa ki adhyaksh uchit samajhe
 The Council of Ministers remains in office till it has the confidence of the Lok Sabha
 lok sabha dwaara mantriparishad main avishvaas vyakt karte hi sarkaar ko sanvaidhanik rup se pad chhodana hota he
 The rules provide for a motion to this effect called a motion of no confidence
 rajyasabha ko avishvaas prastaav par vichaar karne kii shakti praapt nahin he
 The motion of censure differs from the motion of no-confidence
 avishvaas ke prastaav main un kaarnon kaa ullekh nahin hota jin par vah aadhaarit ho
 But it is necessary to mention such reasons or allegations in the motion of condemnation
 yah prastaav katipay nitiyon or kaaryon ke liye sarkaar kii ninda karne ke iraade se pesh kiya jaataa he
 The censure motion is moved against the Council of Ministers or against any one minister or against some ministers
 usamen kisi mantri yaa mantriyon kii vifaltaa par sadan dwaara khed, rosh yaa aashcharya prakat kiya jaataa he
 Government has to do many tasks of governance, security and public welfare
 in sabake liye bahut saadhan chahie
 Where should he come from? The government collects taxes from the public
 jarurat padane par karje bhi leti he
 Because we live in a parliamentary system, it is necessary for the government to get the approval of Parliament before imposing any tax or incurring any expenditure
 is manjuuri ko lene ke liye hi har varsh sarkaar ek bajet yani puure saal kii aamadani or kharche kaa lekha jokha sansad main pesh karti he
 Rail budget and general budget are presented separately
 saamaanya bajet praayah farvari ke antim kaary diwas par laayaa jaataa he
 The railway budget comes a few days before that
 vittiya varsh is samay prayek saal kii pehali april se aarambh hota he
 It is proposed in the budget that how much money is to be spent on the item during the coming year
 usamen kitna dhan kis tareeke se aayega yaa kahan se jutaya jayega
 Grants are given for the coming year of the budget
 sarkaar ko apni vittiya or aarthik nitiyon tathaa kaaryakramon or unki vyakhya karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 At the same time, Parliament also gets an opportunity to consider and criticize them
 bajet paas karne kii prakriya main sansad ke donon sadanon main gambhir evam purna charchaa hoti he
 This happens a few days after the budget is presented
 charchaa saamaanya vaad vivaad se aarambh hoti he
 It lasts for three or four days in both houses of Parliament
 pratha yah he ki is avasthaa main sadsy sarkaar kii rajkoshiya or aarthik nitiyon ke saamaanya pahaluon par hi vichaar karte hai
 Do not go into tax and expenditure details
 is prakaar saamaanya vaad vivaad se prayek sadan ko apane vichaar vyakt karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 The government also realizes what will be the reaction to a particular proposal in later stages
 yah dhyaan dene kii baat he ki rajyasabha ko saamaanya charchaa ke alaava bajet se koi sarokaar nahin hota
 Voting on demands takes place only in the Lok Sabha
 duusari avasthaa anudaanon kii maangon par charchaa or matdaan kii he
 Normally, separate demands are placed for the proposed grants for each ministry
 in ‘maango’ kaa sambandh bajet ke vyay vaale bhaag se hota he
 Their form is that of the request made by the Executive to the Lok Sabha to be given the right to spend the amount demanded
 maango par charchaa ruchipurna hoti he
 During the discussions, the policies and activities of the Ministry are closely scrutinized
 anudaanon kii maangon ke mul prastaav ke sahaayak prastaav pesh karke sadsy aisa kar sakate hai
 These subsidiary proposals are called 'cut motions' in parliamentary language
 bajet paas karne kii prakriya bajet pesh kiye jane se is par charchaa karne or anudaanon kii maange sweekrut karne or viniyog tathaa vitt vidheyakon ke paas hone tak saamanytah chaalu vittiya varsh ke aarambh hone ke baad tak chalati rahati he
 Till Parliament approves the demands, it is necessary that the government has sufficient funds available to run the administration of the country
 isliye ‘lekhanudaan’ ke liye vishesh upbandh kiya gaya he
 By which the Lok Sabha has been given the power to grant advance grants for a part of a financial year till the completion of the budget process
 kanoon bananaa sansad kaa pramukh kaam mana jaataa he
 The initiative for this is mostly done by the executive
 sarkaar vidhaayi prastaav pesh karti he
 After discussion and debate on it, Parliament imposes its seal of approval on it
 sabhi kanoonee prastaav vidheyak ke rup main sansad main pesh kiye jate hai
 a bill is a draft legislative proposal
 vidheyak sansad ke kisi ek sadan main sarkaar dwaara yaa kisi gaiyr-sarkari sadsy dwaara pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus broadly, there are two types of Bills: Government Bills and Private Members' Bills
 vidhi kaa rup lene vaale adhikansh vidheyak sarkari vidheyak hote hai
 By the way, very few bills of non-government members take the form of law
 phir bhi unke dwaara yah baat sarkaar or logon ke dhyaan main laai jaati he ki maujuuda kanoon main sanshodhan karne yaa koi aavashyak vidhaan banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The draft of the Bill is prepared with the help of the Ministry of Law in the Ministry of Government related to that subject
 mantrimandal ke anumodan ke baad ise sansad ke saamne laayaa jaataa he
 It can be introduced in either of the two houses of Parliament by the Minister concerned
 keval dhan vidheyak ke maamle main yah pabandi he ki vah rajyasabha main pesh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Bill has to go through various stages in Parliament before it takes the form of an Act
 prayek vidheyak ke prayek sadan main teen vachan hote hai
 That is, first reading, second reading and third reading
 vidheyak ‘pesh karnaa,’ vidheyak kaa pehla vaachan he
 According to custom, this stage is not discussed
 vidheyak kaa doosraa vaachan sabase adhik vistrut evam mahatvapurn avasthaa he kyonki isi avasthaa main isaki vistrut evam baariki se jaanch kii jaati he
 When the House considers and approves all sections of the Bill and the schedules, if any
 tab mantri yah prastaav kar saktaa he ki vidheyak ko paas kiya jaae
 This is called the third reading
 jis sadan main vidheyak pesh kiya gaya ho usamen paas kiye jane ke baad use sahmati ke liye duusare sadan main bheja jaataa he
 There the bill then passes through all three stages
 kisi vidheyak par donon ke bich asahmati ke kaaran gatirodh hone par ek asaadhaaran sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 Which is resolved in the joint sitting of the two houses
 jab donon sadanon dwaara koi vidheyak alag alag yaa sanyukt baithak main paas kar diya jaataa he to use raashtrapati ke paas bheja jaataa he
 If the President grants permission, the Bill becomes an Act from the date of the assent
 sanshodhan ke dwaara samvidhan ke kisi bhi anuchhed main badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 But according to the decision of the Supreme Court, no change which can destroy or reduce the basic structure or fundamental elements of the Constitution can be made
 sansadeey visheshadhikaar ve vishisht adhikaar hai jo sansad ke donon sadanon ko, uske sadasyon ko or samitiyon ko praapt he
 Privileges are given with the view that both the Houses of Parliament, its committees and members can function independently
 unki garima bani rahe, parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki kanoon kii najaron main saadhaaran nagarikon ke mukaable main visheshadhikaar praapt sadasyon kii sthiti bhinn he
 As far as the enforcement of the statutes is concerned, the members are representatives of the people as well as ordinary citizens
 mul vidhi yah he ki sansad sadasyon sahit sabhi naagarik kanoon kii najaron main baraabar maane jane chahie
 The responsibilities which belong to other citizens also belong to them and perhaps there are some more as members
 sansadon kaa sabase mahatvapurn visheshadhikaar he sadan or uski samitiyon main puri swatantraaa ke saath apane vichaar rakhane kii chhot
 No action can be taken in any court against any matter said or given by a member of Parliament
 sansadeey visheshadhikaron kii suchiyaan taiyaar kii ja sakati hai
 In fact, they have also been prepared, but no such list is complete
 thode main kah sakate hai ki koi bhi vah kaam jo sadan ke, uski samitiyon ke yaa uske sadasyon ke kaam main kisi prakaar kii baadha daale vah sansadeey visheshadhikaar kaa hanan karata he
 For example, a member cannot be arrested not only when the House of which he is a member is in session or while the Parliamentary Committee of which he is a member is in the meeting, or both
 The joint sitting of the Houses is going on, or while the joint sitting of the two Houses is going on
 sansad ke adhiveshan ke prarambh se 40 din pehle or uski samaapti se 40 din baad yaa jabaki vah sadan ko aa rahaa ho yaa sadan ke baahar ja rahaa ho, tab bhi use giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Within the premises of Parliament, no legal or criminal 'summons' can be given without the permission of the Speaker / Chairman
 adhyaksh / sabhapati kii anumati ke bina sansad bhawan ke andar kisi ko bhi giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Because in the premises of Parliament only the orders of the House of Parliament or the Speaker / Chairman are followed
 yahan anya kisi sarkari praadhikari ke yaa sthaneey prashasan ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin hota
 Each House of Parliament is its own defender of privilege
 visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa sadan kii avmaananaa karne vaale ko bhartsana karke yaa taadna karke yaa nirdhaarit avadhi ke liye karawas dwaara dandit kar saktaa he
 In the case of its own members, the House can impose the other two types of punishment, that is, suspend and remove from service of the House, a member may be suspended from serving the House for a specified period
 kisi ati gambhir maamle main sadan se nikaala ja saktaa he
 The House may punish the offenders with imprisonment for a term which does not ordinarily exceed the duration of the session of the House
 jaise hi sadan kaa satravsaan hota he, bandi ko mukt kar diya jaataa he
 Due to the contempt of the House by the audience shouting slogans in the gallery and / or throwing advertisements, both houses have, from time to time, punished the offenders with imprisonment till the House adjourns on that day
 sadan kaa dandic kshetra apane sadanon tak or unke saamne kiye gaye aparaadhon tak hi simit na hokar sadan kii sabhi avmaananaaon par lagu hota he
 Whether contempt is committed by members or by persons who are not members
 isse bhi koi antar nahin padataa ki aparaadh sadan ke bheetar kiya gaya he yaa uske parisar se baahar
 This power of the House to punish persons for breach or contempt of privilege of the House is the foundation of parliamentary privilege
 sadan kii aisi panrapara bhi rahi he ki sadan kaa visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa sadan kii avmaananaa karne ke doshi vyaktiyon dwaara spasht rup se or bina kisi shart ke dil se vyakt kiya gaya khed sadan dwaara sweekaar kar liya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the House generally decides not to take further action on such matters in view of its dignity
 donon sadanon ke sadsy aise vetan or bhatte, jinhen sansad samay samay par, vidhi dwaara tay kare, paane ke hakdaar he
 The Parliament has approved the pension of Members under the Members of Parliament Act
 chaar varsh ke sevakaal vaale prayek sadsy to ek hajaar chaar sau rupaye prati maas kii pension di jaati he
 In addition, 250 rupees are given for each year of service after five years
 prayek sadsy 1500 rupaye pratimaas kaa vetan tathaa aise sthaan par, jahaan sansad ke kisi sadan kaa adhiveshan yaa samiti kii baithak ho, duty par nivas ke dauraan 200 rupaye pratidin kaa bhatta praapt karne kaa hakdaar he
 In addition to the monthly salary and daily allowance, each member is entitled to a constituency allowance of Rs 3000 per month and office expenses at the rate of Rs 1000 per month
 yatra sambandhi suvidhaayen : prayek sadsy nimnlikhit yatra –bhatte paane kaa hakdaar he: For Travel by Rail: An amount equal to one first class and one second class fare vimaan dwaara yatra ke liye: prayek aisi yatra ke liye vimaan kiraye ke sava guna ke baraabar rakam For travel by road: Rupees five per kilometer and 3 / 5 part of the fare in addition to the highest class fare for traveling by steamer
 iske alaava, prayek sadsy ko prativarsh desh ke andar kahin bhi apni patni / apane pati yaa sahchar ke saath 28 ek tarafa vimaan yatraaen karne kii chhot hoti he
 Each member gets a railway pass for himself and companion for traveling in air-conditioned category, any number of times anywhere within the country
 patni / pati ke liye ek alag se paas bhi mil saktaa he
 Telephone: Every member is entitled to free telephone - one in Delhi and the other at his place of residence
 iske alaava, use prativarsh nishulk 50,000 sthaneey kaal karne kii chhot hoti he

 katipay simaaon main bijli tathaa pani nickshulk hote hai
 Each member is given an advance amount to purchase a vehicle during his tenure

 The Parliament complex also has a well-equipped first aid hospital for its members
 sansad kii imaaraton main sansad bhawan, sansadeey saudh, swaagat karyaalay or nirmaanadhin sansadeey gyanpith athwa sansad granthalay sammilit he
 Together, they are called the Parliament Complex
 It consists of wide lanes, reservoirs, fountains and roads

 martin luther king yaa 'martin luther king junior' alag vyakti hai
 Martin Luther is noted for running a corrective movement in Christianity called Protestism
 ve german bhikshu, dharamshastri, vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak, padri evam carch-sudhaarak the jinke vichaaron ke dwaara protestism sudharandolan armbh hua jisane pashchimi europe ke vikaas kii disha badal di
 Luther was born in a city called Iceleven, Germany
 unke pita hens luther khan ke majdoor the, jinke parivaar main kul milakar aath bachche the or martin uski duusari santan the
 At the age of eighteen, Martin Luther joined Erfurt's new university and in 1505 he received his MA
 Got the title of iske baad vah apane pita ke icchaanusaar vidhi kaa adhyayan kane lage kintu ek bhayankar tufaan main apane jivan ko jokhim main samajhakar unhone sanyas lene kii mannath kii
 As a result, he became a member of the Sangh Dharma xxwrep 4 Sanghya in 1505 and in 1507 AD he was given the consecration of the priest
 luther ke adhikari ne unako apane sangh kaa adhyaksh banaan ke uddeshy se unhen vittenberg vishvavidhyalay bheja jahaan luther ko san 1512 i
 main dharmavigyaan main doctorat kii oopaadhi mili
 At the same university he became a professor of Bible and was also appointed to the rank of Provincial Officer of his Union
 luther sheeghra hi apane vyakhyanon main nijee aadhyatmik anubhavon ke aadhaar par bible kii vyakhya karne lage
 At that time there was deep disturbance in his conscience
 ishwar dwaara tehraae hue niyamon ko sahaj rup se puraa karne main apane ko asamarth paakar vah sikhalaane lage ki adipaap ke kaaran manushya kaa swabhaav purna rup se vikrut ho gaya tha 
 The traditional teaching of the Church was that by baptism man is freed from adoration, but Luther believed that after baptism the person remains a sinner and does not earn any virtue through religious works, so he trusts Jesus should keep
 isa ke prati bharosapurna aatmasamarpan ke falswaroop paapi manushya, paapi rahete hue bhi, ishwar kaa kripapaatr banataa he
 These ideas were not compatible with the teaching of the Church, but by 1517 AD Luther revolted against the open-minded Church
 san 1517 kii ghatnaon ko samajhane ke liye "dandamochan" vishyak dharmasiddhant samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The traditional teaching of the church is as follows - The sin of sin is forgiven by true sinners
 kintu paap ke sabhi parinaam nasht nahin hote
 To overcome its consequences, a person has to do penance or suffer punishment
 paap ke un parinaamon ko dur karne ke liye carch paapi kii sahaayta kar saktaa he
 He can pray for her and offer Isa and a portion of his stock of virtuous fruits to the sinner
 carch kii us sahaayta ko indulgens athwa dandamochan kehete hai
 a "sinner" can be found guilty only after he has confessed the sin of sin after confessing and has completed the work of virtue ordained by the church for that punishment
 san 1517 i
 main rome ke sant peter mahamandir ke nirmaan kii aarthik sahaayta karanevaalon ke paksh main ek vishesh dandamochan kii ghoshnaa hui
 Some preachers proclaiming that redemption were less focused on the need to repent for sin and were more focused on collecting money
 usee dandamochan ko lekar luther ne vidroh kiya
 Not only did he condemn the misuse of punishments, he also opposed the doctrine of redemption, and he began to openly teach that the Church or the Pope could not only get rid of the consequences of sin, but only Jesus
 isa manushya ke kisi punya kaary ke kaaran nahin balik apni dayaa se hi paapon se ghrinaa karanevaale logon ko dandamochan pradaan karte hai
 On behalf of Rome, Luther was requested to withdraw his teaching about the execution, but Luther refused to do so and clarified his assumptions in three new compositions
 unhone rome ke adhikaar kaa tathaa purohiton ke avivaahit rahane kii pratha kaa virodh kiya, bible ko chhodkar isai dharm ne koi or aadhaar nahin mana tathaa keval teen sanskaron kaa arthath baptism, papasvikaar tathaa ukharist ko sweekaar kiya
 In the north, Rome announced the exclusion of Luther from the Catholic Church in 1520 AD
 us samay se luther apane nae sampradaay kaa netritv karne lage
 In 1524, he married Catherine Bora
 unka andolan german rashtriyata kii bhaavana se mukt nahin tha or unhen adhikansh german shaskaon kaa samarthan praapt hua
 Probably for this reason, he left the organization of his sect to the rulers excessively
 jab katholic samrat chalrs pancham ne lutheran shaskaon se nivedan kiya ki ve apane-apane kshetron ke katholic isaayiyon ko saarvajanik puja karne kii anumati den tab lutheran shaskaon na us prastaav ke virodh main samrat ke paas ek teevr pratwaad bhej diya or samrat ko jhukna padaa
 Because of this protest, that new religion was named Protestat
 paashchaatya isai dharm ke itihaas main luther kaa sthaan atyant mahatvapurn he
 As a result of his rebellion against the Roman Catholic Church, although the unity of the Western Christian denomination had been dissipated for centuries and remains so till date, it cannot be denied that Luther was an extraordinary genius who was inspired by true religious sentiments
 Was voiced
 bhashaa ke kshetra main bhi luther kaa mahatv adwitiya he
 He composed a number of soulful hymns in the German language and also presented a German translation of the Bible which has Luther's indelible mark on the modern German language
 katholic carch se alag ho jane ke baad luther ne apana adhikansh jivan vittanvarg main bitaa diya jahaan vah vishvavidhyalay main apane vyaakhyaan dete rahe or dharmavigyaan tathaa bible ke vishay main apni bahusankhyak rachanaaon kii sristi karte rahe
 In 1546 AD, he went to Mansfeld for the purpose of resolving a dispute and returning from there, he settled in his birthplace of Isleban
 unke dehanth ke samay westephelia, rinlad or bavaria ko chhodkar samast germany lutheran shaskaon ke haath main thi
 In addition, Lutheranism also spread to nearby countries of Germany and all Christians in Scandinavia became Lutherans

 The main center of Lutheranism is Germany, where fifty-two percent of the people are Lutherans

 Libertarianism wants to severely limit the role of the state in the life of man and society
 isaki do pramukh shakhaayen hai
 One branch is of anarchists who believe that the government is not a legitimate institution in itself
 duusari shakha nyanutamavaadiyon kii he jo maanati he ki sarkaar ko nunatam kaam karne kaa adhikaar he jinamein police-suraksha, anubandhon kaa karyanvayan karwaanaa, naagarik or faujadaari adaalat kaayam karnaa shaamil he
 But most minimalists also believe that their list does not include the right to collect taxes
 yahan tak ki upar varnit kaam puure karne ke liye bhi sarkaar ko logon se tex nahin lenaa chahie
 Anarchists think that this state of cricket's nightwatchman type is too broad
 ve maanate hai ki nunetamavaadiyon ne sarkaar ko jo kaam diye hai, ve bhi nijee agenciyon dwaara kiye jane chahie
 Some anarchists do not want the government to consume any kind of power even for the safety of the individual
 swatantraaavaadi vyakti ke aatm-swaamitv yaa ‘self onorship’ ke vichaar par bal dete hai
 The idea of self-ownership is a form of the formula that Kant considers people to be self-evident
 iskaa arth yah he ki har vyakti khud apana maalik he
 Therefore, no one needs to interfere in his life in a way that violates his self-ownership
 is aadhaar par bhi swatantraavaad do dhaaraon main bant jaataa he : pehla, dakshinpanthi swatantraavaad or doosraa vampanthi swatantraavaad
 The right-wing libertarian advocates the concept of a minimum state
 uskaa maananaa he ki vyakti ko aseem sampatti kaa adhikaar he
 If the state imposes any kind of tax on the person, it will be a violation of the principle of self-ownership
 lock ke vichaaron main iske sutara paye ja sakate hai
 Hayek and Freedman have also supported this idea in the 12th century

 rothbird kaa naam bhi pramukh he
 Rothbird rejected the state by linking the doctrine of a non-intervening state with the infinite version of human rights
 samakaleen vidwaanon main robert nozic is ke sabase bade samarthak hai
 On the other hand, left-libertarianism also has a long tradition
 vam-swatantraaavaadi attharahavin or unnisvin sadi vichaarkon, jaise thomas pen, henry jorge or peter walrus, ke vichaaron se prerana grahan karte hai
 Nowadays it is supported by thinkers such as Halel Steiner and Peter Valentin
 vam-swatantraavaad bhi aatm-swaamitv par jor detaa he
 He believes that in order to give the right to self-ownership to the propertyless people, either resources should be nationalized, or they should be made accessible to all people
 filhal swatantraavaad ke naam par keval dakshinpanthi-swatantraavaad kaa hi bolbalaa he
 Following the publication of philosopher Robert Nozick's work 'anarchy, State and Utopia' in 1974, the movement received considerable academic attention
 yah pustak jon rolls kii a thiyari of justise ke 1971 ke prakaashan main kuch saamne aayi thi
 In his book, Nozick argues that the state should do only security and justice, under this principle of justice it is believed that property and income should be distributed in a particular way keeping in mind the characteristics of the people
 nozic ne vikhyath basketbaal khilaadi wilt chemberlen ke udhaaharan se dikhaaya he ki kis tarah choti-choti gatividhiyaan vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa ulanghan karti hai
 Nozick says that if everyone gives a quarter of a dollar to an egalitarian society to show Chamberlain a game of basketball, he will accumulate a lot of wealth
 nozic pattern aadhaarit nyaay kii samasyaon se bachane ke liye isaki jagah aitihaasik siddhant apanaate hai
 He made Locke's description the basis of his historical theory
 unke anusaar yah zaruri nahin he ki vyakti naitik rup se apni sampatti ke laayak ho
 Instead, a person can only be entitled to property
 ek vyakti sampatti kaa tabhi hakdaar ho saktaa he jab usne kisi laavaaris padi vastu kaa nyaaypurna adhigrahan kiya ho; yaa phir usne kisi aise vyakti se sampatti lee ho jiskaa us par nyaaypurna shuruaati adhigrahan ho
 Also, Nozick also arranges for the rectification of the injustices of the past
 arthath yadi upar-varnt prakriya ke anusaar sampatti hasil nahin kii gayi he to vyakti iske liye parishodhan kaa daawa kar saktaa he
 In his book, Nazick also tries to show that a libertarian society meets the most coherent definition of the utopian social system
 iske alaava, david gauthier jaise vidwaanon ne parsparik laabh ke aadhaar par swatantraavaad kii tarafadaari kii he
 On the other hand, many scholars have advocated libertarianism on the basis of logic to increase freedom as much as possible
 swatantraavaad ke dakshinpanthi sanskaran kaa aadharbhoot tark behad kamazor he
 It simply accepts the inequality of property and resources in the society
 nozic ke siddhant main is sawaal kaa jawaab dene kii koshish nahin kii gayi he ki kya vartmaan daur main bade-bade poonjipatiyon ne apni sampatti nyaaypurna adhigrahan ke siddhant ke anusaar hasil kii thi
 Similarly, it is not clear whether all the people were given the same resources initially
 If this is not done then why should not the wealthless and resourceless people demand redistribution of resources? Although left-libertarianism raises such issues, the influence of right-libertarianism has steadily increased
 iskaa mukhya kaaran lokopkaaree rajya kii naakaami he

 For a physical object, especially an electronic device with an electrical resistance R, the definition of electrical conductivity g would be: g = 1 r = i v , { \ displaystyle G={ \ frac {1}{R}}={ \ frac {I}{V}},} Where i is the electric current passing through the object and simons ikai g chaalakata ke liye, hogi: Note that the final unit is in SI derived unit, where a is the symbol of ampere, which is the unit of current, kg is the sign of kilogram, unit of weight, m is the sign of meter in length
 s samay kii ikai sellind he, c vidyut aavesh kii ikai culumb he; v vibhavantar kii ikai volt he; ω vidyut pratirodh kii vyutpann ikai ohm kaa chinh he
 So any device whose conductance is a Simmons, the difference is one volt; The current will be an ampere
 For each of its additional volts, the current will increase by one ampere

 God only knows what is going on me

 jinna antarrashtriya hawaii adde ke At the time when there were new ideas about the religion of Lord Mahavira and Buddha in India, a reformer was born in China, named Confucius
 us samay china main jhou rajvansh kaa basant or sharad kaal chal rahaa tha
 Over time, the power of the Zhou dynasty had become weak, many states were established in China, which always fought among themselves, which came to be called the era of quarreling states
 atah china kii praja bahut hi ksht jhel rahi thi
 At such a time, Mahatma Confucius emerged to teach morality lessons to the people of China
 inkaa janm isa messiah ke janm se kareeb 550 varsh pehle china ke shandong pradesh main hua tha
 His father died in childhood
 unke gyaan kii aakanksha aseem thi
 They had to acquire knowledge by suffering a lot
 17 varsh kii umr main unhen ek sarkari naukari mili
 After a few years, he left the government job and started teaching
 ghar main hi ek vidhyalay kholkar unhone vidhyaarthiyon ko shiksha dena prarambh kiya
 He used to teach students history, poetry and ethics orally
 unhone kavy, itihaas, sangeet or nitishastra par kai pustakon kii rachana kii
 He was the ruler of a city in Lu State at the age of 53 and later he was appointed as a minister
 mantri hone ke naate inhone dand ke badale manushya ke charitra sudhaar par bal diya
 Confucius gave the message of truth, love and justice to his disciples
 ve sadachaar par adhik bal dete the
 He used to inspire people to become humble, benevolent, virtuous and characterful
 They used to ask elders and ancestors to respect them
 He used to say don't treat others like you don't want to do with yourself
 kanceyucious ek sudhaarak the, dharm prachaarak nahin
 He did not give any teachings about God, but still later people started considering him as a religious teacher
 inaki mrityu 480 i
 pus
 main ho gai thi
 Confucian social reformers preached a stability in Chinese society
 kanceyucious kaa darshan shaastra aaj bhi chini shiksha ke liye path pradarshak bana hua he
 The Confucians never thought it necessary to give their ideas in writing
 uskaa mat tha ki vah vichaaron kaa vaahak ho saktaa he, unka srashta nahin
 He was a worshiper of archeology, because he thought that only through this can real knowledge be gained
 uskaa kahana tha ki manushya ko uske samast kaaryakalapon ke liye niyam apane andar hi praapt ho sakate hai
 Not only for the individual, but the rules and patterns of improvement and correct development of the whole society can be found in the words and work of the ancient Mahatmas
 kanfushas ne koi aisa lekh nahin choda jisamen uske dwaara pratipaadit naitik evam saamaajik vyavastha ke siddhanton kaa nirupan ho
 But all the information related to it is found in books called 'the Principle of Average' written by his grandson Tje Sje and 'mahan Shiksha' written by his disciple Tsong Sin
 'basant or patjhad' naamak ek granth, jise lu kaa itivrutt bhi kehete hai, kanfushas kaa likhaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 This entire work is well received and although very small, it is considered ideal for brief histories of China
 kanfushas ke shishyon kii sankhya sab milakar praaia: 3,000 tak pahunch gai thi, kintu unamem se 75 ke lagbhag hi ucch koti ke pratibhashali vidvan the
 His dear disciples used to stay near him
 ve uske aasapaas shraddhapurvak uthte-baithte the or uske aacharan kii sookshm visheshtaon par dhyaan diya karte the tathaa uske mukh se nikali vaani ke prayek shabd ko hridyangam kar lete or usapar manan karte the
 He used to study ancient history, poetry and social practices of the country from him
 kanfushas kaa kahana tha ki kisi desh main acha shashan or shanti tabhi sthapit ho sakati he jab shaasha, mantri tathaa janata kaa prayek vyakti apane sthaan par uchit kartavyon kaa paalan karata rahe
 The ruler should be the ruler in the true sense, the minister should be the minister in the true sense
 kanfushas se ek baar poocha gaya ki yadi use kisi pradesh ke shashansutra ke sanchaalan kaa bhaar saunpa jaae to vah sabase pehla koun sa mahatvapurn kaary karegaa
 His answer for this was - 'improvement of Names'
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo jis naam ke pad par pratishthit ho use us pad se sanlagn sabhi kartavyon kaa vidhiwat paalan karnaa chahie jisase uskaa vah naam sarthak ho
 He had full faith in the power of example and ideal
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki adarsh vyakti apane sadacharan se jo udhaaharan prastut karte hai, aam janata unke saamne nishchay hi jhuk jaati he
 If the ruler of a country is made well aware of what he should do and how to do governance, then surely he can improve his conduct and make his state happy by presenting his example, Can make it rich and prosperous
 isi vishwaas ke bal par kanfushas ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadi koi shaasha 12 maheene ke liye use apana mukhya paramarshdaata bana le to vah bahut kuch karke dikhaa saktaa he or yadi use teen varsh kaa samay diya jaae to vah apane aadarsho or aashaaon ko moort rup pradaan kar saktaa he
 Confucius never claimed that he received any divine power or divine messages
 vah keval is baat kaa chintan karata tha ki vyakti kya he or samaaj main uske kartavya kya hai
 He never mentioned power performance, extraordinary and non-human powers, rebellious tendencies and deities
 uskaa kathan tha ki budhimatta kii baat yahi he ki prayek vyakti purna uttardayitv or eemaandaaree se apane kartavya kaa paalan kare or devi devataaon kaa aadar karte hue bhi unase alag rahe
 He was of the opinion that the person who cannot serve human beings will serve the Gods and Goddesses
 use apane or dusron ke sabhi kartavyon kaa purna dhyaan tha, isiilie usne kaha tha ki bura aadmi kabhi bhi shashan karne ke yogya nahin ho saktaa, bhale hi vah kitna bhi shaktisampann ho
 The ruler punishes those who violate the rules, but he should never forget that there is no power other than the power to present his ideal of good conduct
 kanfushas ke darshanik, saamaajik tathaa raajnneetik vichaaron par aadhaarit mat ko kanfooshivaad yaa kungaphutsiwad naam diya jaataa he
 According to Confucian, goodness is a natural quality of man
 manushya ko yah swaabhaavik gun ishwar se praapt hua he
 Therefore, to act according to this nature is to respect God's will and to not act accordingly is to disobey God
