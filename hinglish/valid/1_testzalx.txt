in rashtriya bhashaaon main se kisi ek bhashaa kaa upyog kiya gaya to jis deshki yah mul bhashaa he, us desh ko atyant raajnneetik or saanskrithik laabh or shreshthata praapt hogi
 For this reason, this measure is not accepted by other members, however, in the Universal Postal Union, French is still used as the main language
 is samasyaka hal isi main he kii koi ek tatasth or yojit asperanto yaa ido jaisi bhashaa kaa upyog kiya jaae
 This language will not be used in lieu of ethnic languages, but will be used to bridge the gap between people, who are unable to address in any other way
 is tarah se ham bich raste main mil sakate hai or kisi ek paksh ko anya logon se zyaada laabh nahi hoga
 The language chosen should not be too artificial
 uskaa shabd sangrah prachlit bhashaaon par aadhaarit hona chahie 
 Its grammar should be as simple as possible without any exceptions or idioms, which create obstacles in the way of national language learners
 isi vichaarne anek logon ko prerit kiya, inamen se padri shlair, volapu bhashaa ke avishkaarak or doctor zamenhof, jinaki bhashaa esparanto pichhali ek shatabdi se ajtak duniya main sabase zyaada jaani hui yojit bhashaa he
 After a few years of experimentation several proposals were made to improve this language
 esparantoka ek niyam aisa he ki visheshan or jin shabdon ko vah parimit karte hai, unke antim akshar samaan hone chahie
 There is no need for such complexity as the languages of English and Hungarian appear in which the grammar adjectives are unchanged
 or zamenhof bhi is bhav se anukool the, parantu kai kaarnon se asperantoke vyakaran niyamon main badal nahi hua
 On the basis of these reform suggestions, some scientists and philanthropists together developed the Edo language
 is samiti main bhashaa praveen professor oto jesprasan or francisi ganitagya or darshanik professor lui quturat sammilit the
 He chose the best features from the built languages such as Esperanto and Idiom Neutral and by improving it expanded a language that would be the simplest and most modern language in the world
 doctor zamenhof kii drushti main ek or bahut taarkik or suvidhajanak anumati thi
 In Esperanto, the noun of a person or animal is mostly masculine
 agar in shabdon kaa ling streeling main badalanaa ho to uname vibhakti lagaai jaati he
 In its place, Zamenhof thought of not having gender differences in nouns, but this did not change
 ido bhashaa main yah sudharnaayen apanaayi gayi magar esparanto main nahin
 Most of those who have practiced these two organized languages prefer Edo
 donon bhashaaon main anek chizein ubhaynishth he, inamen sammilit he shlair or zamenhof kii prerana
 Due to the unquestionable enthusiasm and anxiety of the aspirants of Esperanto's progress, the idea of spreading the international subsidiary language has become very well known
 esparanto bhi kaaphi jaani hui or saral bhashaa he, magar uske anokhe or asaadhaaran uccharan chinh or anaavashyak jatilta ke kaaran kai log use pasand nahi karte
 Where there are deficiencies in Esperanto, Edo moves ahead by improving them
 jinako ido kaa anubhav he unhe pataa he kitna aasaan he sochna kii hamen kya kahana he, naa kii hamen kaise kahana chahie
 But all these things related to theory, how is Edo in ordinary practice? Edo speakers have held several conferences in many countries
 isse yah sabit hota he kii is bhashaa kaa upyog safal he
 Books, word lists and books about grammar about Edo are published in many national languages
 is bhashaa main kaaphi kavita bhi likhi hui hai or ek vir vishyak hasyaprad kahani bhi 
 a new world sees their way, whoever makes a little effort to learn this admirable language
 is bhashaa kaa upyog shauk ke taurase bhi kiya ja saktaa he or iske atirikt duniya ke bare main adhik jaankaree praapt karne kaa saadhan bhi ho saktaa he
 At this time there are no books or other means in Hindi to learn Edo
 hindi bolne vaale kisi or bhashaa ke dwaara hi ido sikh sakate hai
 There are many places in the internet where Edo can be learned through English or some other European language

 All the stories and stories related to this have been on the tongue of the people for the last several decades

 This is the reason why every village and town in this area has many stories to narrate
 bundelkhand kii do khubasurat or dilachasp jagahen hai orchha or kundhaar
 Even though there is a distance of a few kilometers in both places, these two places are very strongly linked with the threads of history

 Its history dates back to the 8th century, when Gurjara Pratihara was founded by Emperor Mihir Bhoja
 is jagah kii pehali or sabase rochak kahani ek mandir kii he
 Actually, this temple was built for the idol of Lord Rama, but it did not move from its place when the idol was installed
 is murti ko madhukar shah ke rajyakaal ke dauraan unki rani ganesh kuvar ayodhya se laai thim
 It was installed in the palace for some time before the Chaturbhuj Temple was built
 lekin mandir banane ke baad koi bhi murti ko uske sthaan se hilaa nahin paaya
 Believing it to be a miracle of God, the palace itself was given the shape of a temple and was named Ram Raja Mandir
 aaj is mahal ke chaaron ore shahar basaa he or ram navami par yahaan hajaaron shraddhalu ikattha hote hai
 By the way, Lord Rama is considered to be Lord here and is also considered the king here, because the face of that idol is not towards the temple but towards the palace

 However, there is no strong evidence about this

 These temples are crossed by a decades-old bridge, on the outskirts of the city is the 'royal Enclave'

 kaha jaataa he ki badshaah akbar ne abul fazal ko shahjade saleem ko kaabo karne ke liye bheja tha, lekin saleem ne bir singh kii madad se uskaa katl karvaa diya
 Pleased with this, Salim handed over the command of Orchha to Bir Singh
 vaise, ye mahal bundelaon kii vaastushilp ke pramaan hai
 All the Bundela architectural features like open corridors, stone latticework, animal sculptures, balloons can be seen here
 ab behad shant dikhne vaale ye mahal apane jamaane main aise nahin the
 Stories stemming from the new movements happening here everyday are still on people's tongues
 inhen main se ek he hardaul kii kahani, jo jujhar singh ke rajya kaal kii he
 In fact, due to the conspiracy stories of Mughal spies, this king suspected that his queen had relations with his brother Hardaul
 lihaaja usne rani se hardaul ko zehar dene ko kaha
 To prove himself innocent when the queen could not do so, Hardaul himself drank poison and set a new example of sacrifice
 bundelaon kaa raajkaal 1783 main khatm hone ke saath hi orchha bhi gumnami ke ghaney jangalon main kho gaya or phir yah swatantraaa sangram ke samay surkhiyon main aayaa
 Actually, freedom fighter Chandrashekhar Azad came and hid in a village here

 bhagwaan shriram kaa orchha main 400 varsh purv rajbhishek hua tha or uske baad se aaj tak yahaan bhagwaan shriram ko raja ke rup main puja jaataa he
 It is the only temple in the entire world where Lord Rama is worshiped as a king
 ramraaja ke ayodhya se orchha aane kii ek manohari katha he
 One day Orchha King Madhukarshah asked his wife Ganeshkunwari to walk to Vrindavan with the intention of worshiping Krishna
 lekin rani ram bhakt thim
 He refused to go to Vrindavan
 krodh main aakar raja ne unase yah kaha ki tum itani ram bhakt ho to jaakar apneraam ko orchha le aao
 The queen reached Ayodhya and started her cultivation near the Lakshman fort on the banks of Saryu river
 inhen dinon sant shiromani tulsidas bhi ayodhya main sadhana rat the
 The queen's worship continued to be steadily stronger with blessings from the saint
 lekin rani ko kai maheenon tak ramraaja ke darshan nahin hue
 Ultimately, he got frustrated and jumped into the lair of Sarayu to give up his life
 yaheen jal kii atal gaharaaiyon main unhen ramraaja ke darshan hue
 The queen told him her wish
 ramraaja ne orchha chalanaa sweekaar kiya kintu unhone teen shatar rakhin- pehali, yah yatra paidal hogi, duusari- yatra keval pushp nakshatra main hogi, teesri- ramraaja kii murti jis jagah rakhi jaaegi vahaan se pun: nahin uthegi
 The queen sent a message to the king that she was coming to Orchha with Ramraja
 raja madhukarshah ne ramraaja ke vigrah ko sthapit karne ke liye karodon kii laagat se chaturbhuj mandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 When the queen reached Orchha, she kept this idol in her palace
 yah nishchit hua ki shubh murut main murti ko chaturbhuj mandir main rakhkar isaki praan pratishtha kii jaaegi
 But this Deity of Rama refused to go to the quadrilateral
 kehete hai ki ram yahaan bal rup main aae or apni maa kaa mahal chhodkar wo mandir main kaise ja sakate the
 Rama still sits in this palace and the quadrangular temple built for him is deserted even today
 yah mandir aaj bhi murti viheen he
 It is also a coincidence that the writing of Ramcharit Manas was also completed on the same day in 1631, when Ramaraja arrived in Orchha
 jo murti orchha main vidyaman he uske bare main bataaya jaataa he ki jab ram vanvaas ja rahe the to unhone apni ek bal murti maa kaushalya ko di thi
 Mother Kaushalya used to offer her child enjoyment
 jab ram ayodhya laute to kaushalya ne yah murti sarayu nadi main visarjeet kar di
 The same idol was found in Ganeshkunwari in the lair of Saryu

 If we convert the words "boy will go" and "girl will go" into Kannauji and Brajbhasha, we will give the following form: kannauji main - larika jaihai
 Daughter is brajabhasha main - chhora jaigau
 Will be left
 uparyukt udaahranon se spasht he ki brajabhasha ke saamaanya bhavishyat kaal rup main kriya karta ke ling ke anusaar parivartit hoti he, jab ki kannauji main ek rup rahati he
 Apart from this, Kannauji also has a tendency to discolour like Awadhi, which is lacking in Braj Bhasha
 kannauji ke sangya, sarvnaam aadi vaakyapadon main sandhirahitya praaia: miltaa he, kintu brajabhasha main ve pad sandhigat avasthaa main milte hai

 When his films were failing, critics started saying that Madhubala did not have talent and some of his films were hits because of his beauty, not his acting
 lekin aisa nahin tha
 The reason for his film being flopped was the inability to choose the right films
 madhubala ke pita hi unke manager the or vahi filmon kaa chunaav karte the
 Madhubala was the only member of the family whose income depended on this large family
 atah inke pita parivaar ke paalan-poshan ke liye kisi bhi tarah ke film kaa chunaav kar lete the
 Regardless of whether or not Madhubala gets a chance to show her talent in that film, that is what caused some of her films to fail

 It is also said that Dilip Kumar was ready, but Madhubala's greedy relatives did not allow this marriage
 1958 me ayatollah khan ne court me dilip kumaar ke khilaaf ek cese daayar kar ke dono ko paraspar prem khatm karne par baadhya bhi kiya
 Madhubala received proposals from three different people for marriage
 vah suzav ke liye apni mitra nargis ke paas gayi
 Nargis suggested marrying Bharat Bhushan, who was a widower
 nargis ke anusaar bharat bhushan, pradeep kumaar evam kishor kumaar se behatar the
 But Madhubala chose Kishore Kumar out of his own will
 kishor kumaar ek talakshuda vyakti the
 Madhubala's father told Kishore Kumar that she was going to London for surgery and they could marry only after she returned
 madhubala mrityu se pehle vivaah karnaa chaahati thim ye baat kishor kumaar ko pataa tha
 They married in 1960
 parantu kishor kumaar ke mata-pita ne kabhi bhi madhubala ko sweekaar nahi kiya
 He thought Madhubala was the reason for her son's first marriage to break up
 kishor kumaar ne mata-pita ko khush karne ke liye hindu reeti-rivaaj se punah shaadi kii, lekin ve unhe manaa na sake
 His performance in mughal-e-azam is particularly notable
 is film me sirf unka abhinay hi nahi balki 'kala ke prati samarpan' bhi dekhne ko miltaa he
 The role of 'anarkali' was the most important role in his life
 unka lagaataar girtaa hua swasthya unhen abhinay karne se roak rahaa tha lekin wo nahin rukin
 He had determined to complete the film
 film ke nirdeshak ke
 aashif film me vaastaviktaa laana chaahate the
 He was also unaware of Madhubala's disease
 unhone shooting ke liye asli janziron kaa prayog kiya
 Despite acting poorly with Madhubala, he starred alongside Jhanjiro
 in janziron se unke haath kii twachaa chhil gayi lekin fir bhi unhone abhinay jari rakhaa
 Madhubala had not only physical but mental troubles at that time
 dilip kumaar se vivaah na ho paane kii vajah se vah avsaad se peedit ho gayin thim
 Despite so much suffering, so much dedication is seen in very few artists
 5 agast 1960 ko jab mughale-e-aazam pradarshit huyi to film samikshakon tathaa darshakon ko bhi ye mehnat or lagan saafe-saafe dikhaai padi
 In fact, it was Madhubala's hard work that made this film reach the climax of success
 is film ke liye unhe film fair award ke liye namit kiya gaya tha
 However, he did not get this award
 kuch log sandeh vyakt karte he kii madhubala ko yah puraskaar isaliye nahi mil paaya kyonki vah ghoose dene ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 It was because of the popularity of this film that the film was again screened all over the world in 2004
 madhubala, hriday rog se peedit thim jiskaa pataa 1950 me niyamit hone vaale swasthya pareekshan me chal chukaa tha
 But this fact was kept hidden from the film industry
 lekin jab halaat badtar ho gayi to ye chup naa sakaa
 Sometimes, his health deteriorated badly on the sets of films
 chikitsa ke liye jab vah landan gayi to doctoron ne unki surgery karne se manaa kar diya kyonki unhe dar tha ki wo surgery ke dauraan hi mar jaayengin

 Many other plants use the term "bay leaf", but not in the context of bay laurel leaves
 These include: be laurel vriksh ko likhit itihaas kii shuruyaat se ugaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Cassia originated in Asia Minor and spread to the Mediterranean and other countries with suitable climates
 tej patta uttari kshetron main nahin ugaaya jaataa he, kyonki ye paudhe thandi jalwaayu main nahin panpate hai

 When dried, its fragrance is herb-like, slightly floral and somewhat like oregano and Jalanim
 micreen, jo kai sugandhit telon kaa ghatak he jinka istemaal parafum banane main kiya jaataa he, use tej pattey se nikaala ja saktaa he

 Bay leaves can be crushed or ground before cooking

 Grounded leaves can be used in place of standing leaves and do not need to be removed, but are relatively strong due to the increased surface area and the texture may not be desirable in some dishes
 tej patton ko pentry main khaadya keet, mackhiyon or tilchatton ko dur bhagane ke liye bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 It is also true that Romanians keep a dry bay leaf under their pillow on St

 While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their similarity with bay leaves has reinforced the notion that bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous
 yah sach nahin he - tej pattiyon ko vishakt prabhaav ke bina khaaya ja saktaa he
 However, they remain very stiff even after complete cooking and if swallowed whole or in large pieces can pose a risk of scratching or suffocation in the digestive system

 Three horoscopes are considered important in any horoscope
 raashi, jisamen jataka kaa surya sthit ho, vah surya-raashi ke rup main, jisamen jataka kaa chandra sthit ho, vah chandra-raashi ke rup main tathaa jis raashi kaa udai jataka ke janm ke samay purvi kshitij main ho rahaa ho, vah lagn-raashi ke rup main mahatvapurn maani jaati he
 Now-a-days in the market, there is a discussion of the zodiac-fruit in almost all the patrika, some magazines mention the horoscope as the sun-sign and some as the moon-sign, but they are completely unscientific and in vain
 Millions of people are trapped in isaki jagah lagn-raashi fal nikaalane se pathakon ko atyadhik laabh pahunch saktaa he, kyonki janmasamay main lagbhag do ghante kaa bhi antar ho to do vyakti ke lagn main parivartan ho jaataa he, jabaki chandrarashi ke antargat dhai din ke andar tathaa surya raashi ke antargat ek mahine ke andar janmalenevaale sabhi vyakti ek hi raashi main aa jate hai
 But since the readers are not aware of their ascendant, astrologers remove the zodiac sign in place of the ascendant and make it well-known to the general public, but this puts a question mark on the science of astrology
 kisi prakaar kii samayik bhavishyavaanee kisi vyakti ke lagn ke aadhaar par sateek rup main kii ja sakati he, kintu isaki tivrata main vibhinn vyakti ke liye antar ho saktaa he
 The ascendant written in a particular month will give the same result for crores of people in that ascendant, even if it has some difference with respect to level, environment, situation and its natal planets
 jaise kisi vishesh samay main kisi lagn ke liye laabh ek majdoor ko 25-50 rupye kaa or ek vyavsaayee ko lakhon kaa laabh de saktaa he
 This type of prediction can be made on the basis of 'dynamic transiting system'

 Pangea, Pangea or Pangea, was a vast unified continent that existed during the Paleozoic and Mizozoic eras around 250 million years ago; The present continent has come out of this in its present form
 yah naam alfred vegener ke mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant kii vaigyanik charchaa main gadha gaya tha
 In his book, "the Origin of Continents and Oceans", he considered that all continents were part of a vast continent at one time, which he called "the continent", before subsequently disintegrating and flowing to their present places

 The exact configuration and geodynamics history of Rodinia is not as well understood as that of Panotia and Pangea
 When the fragmentation of Rodinia occurred, it was divided into three pieces: the vast continent of proto-lauresia, the vast continent of proto-gondwana, and relatively Small Congo Cretan
 proto-lauresia and proto-gondwanaland were separated by the proto-tethys Ocean
 proto-loresia ke swayan vibhajit hokar alag-alag hone ke turant baad laurenshia, siberia or baltic mahadwipon kaa nirmaan hua
 Its rift also created two new oceans, the Iapetus Ocean and the Paleocean Ocean
 baltic laurenshia ke purv main or siberia laurenshia ke uttar-purv main sthit tha
 Around 600 ma, most of these oceans came back together to form Panotia, a relatively short giant continent consisting of a large amount of land near the poles and just a relatively small strip connecting the polar oceans near the equator
 isaki utpatti ke keval 60 million varsh ke baad, lagbhag 540 eme, cambrian yug kii shuruyaat ke kareeb panotia phir se vikhandit ho gaya jisase laurenshia, baltic or gondvanaa ke dakshini vishaal mahadweep kaa janm hua
 In the Cambrian period, the independent continent of Laurentia, which became North America, became located on the equator with delimited oceans bounded on three sides: the Panthalassic Ocean to the north and west, the Ipitus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east
 Around 480 MA in the oldest Ordovician, the small continent of Avalonia, a part of land that formed the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia, and England, was liberated from Gondwana and began its journey towards Laurentia
 baltic, laurenshia or evalonia sabhi ordovisian kaal ke ant tak ek saath mil gaye or is tarah ipitas mahaasaagar ke nikat ek chote mahadweep kaa nirmaan hua jise uramerica yaa loresia kaha gaya
 The North Appalachians also originated as a result of the collision
 Siberia is located near Euramerica with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents
 jab ye sabhi ghatnaayen ho rahi thim, gondvanaa dhire-dhire dakshini dhruv kii ore khisak gaya
 This was the first phase of Pangea's origin

 Avalonia had not yet collided with Laurentia, and a remnant of the Ipitus Ocean, a sea route between them, was still shrinking as Avalonia slowly slid towards Laurentia
 is bich dakshini europe gondvanaa se khandit ho gaya or navgathit rek mahaasaagar ke paar uramerica kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or devonian main dakshini baltic se takaraa gaya, haalanki yah chota mahadweep pani ke neeche kii ek pattee ke rup main tha
 The Khanty Ocean, a branch of the Ipitus Ocean, was also shrinking from Siberia as an island island that collided with the eastern Baltic
 is dweepiya vrutt ke peeche ek nayaa sagar, ural mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Towards the end of the Silurian period North and South China moved away from Gondwana and began to move northward across the shrinking proto-tethys Ocean, with the new paleo-tethys Ocean opening at its southern tip
 devonian kaal main gondvanaa swayan uramerica kii ore badhane laga tha jiske kaaran rek mahaasaagar sikud rahaa tha
 In the early Carboniferous era, northwest Africa touched the southeastern coast of Euramerica, starting to form the Appalachian Mountains and the southern parts of the Meseta Mountains

 North China and Southern China were located on independent continents
 chota mahadweep kazakhstania madhya carbonipheras yug main siberia se takaraa gaya tha
 Western Kazakhstania collided with the Baltic at the end of the Carboniferous Era, causing them to cease contact with the Ural Ocean and causing them to originate in the western proto-tethys Ural mountains and the vast continent Lauresia
 This was the last stage of Pangea's origin
 is bich dakshini america dakshini laurenshia se takaraa gaya tha jisase rek mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya tha or epalachiyans evam auchita parvaton ke sabase dakshini hisse kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 By this time Gondwana was located near the South Pole and glaciers were formed in Antarctica, India, Australia, South Africa, and South America
 uttari china kaa hissaa carbonipheras yug ke ant tak siberia se takaraa gaya tha or is tarah proto-tethis mahaasaagar puri tarah se band ho gaya tha
 At the beginning of the Permian era, the Cimmerian Plate split off from Gondwana and began to move towards Lauresia, creating a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean at its southern tip, and closing the path to the plato-tethys Ocean
 zyaadaatar bhu-bhaag abhi bhi ekikrut hi tha
 In the Triassic period, Pangea moved slightly in the southwest direction
 cimerian plate ab bhi sikudte peleo-tethis ke paar ja rahi thi jo jurassic kaal ke madhya tak jari rahaa
 peleo-tethis pashchim se purv tak band ho gaya tha or is tarah cimerian orogeni kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Pangea looked like the letter "C" in English, which contained an ocean, the new Tethys Ocean, inside the Sea

 Fossil-evidence of Pangea includes the presence of similar and integral species found on continents that have now gone far

 Additional evidence of Pangea is found in the geology of the adjacent continents, including the matching of geological trends between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa
 carbonipheras kaal ke dhruviya barf kii parat ne panzia ke dakshini chor ko dhank liya tha

 Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; When rocks are formed, they absorb the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles are present relative to the rock

 Samples of sedimentary rocks and intrusive igneous rocks have a magnetic tilt which is usually an average of these 'similar shifts' in magnetic northward tilt as their magnetic fields do not immediately form as in the frosting lava

 Pangea had three major phases of fragmentation
 pehla charan praarambhik-madhya jurassic kaal main shuru hua tha jab panzia purv main tethis mahaasaagar se or pashchim main prashanth mahaasaagar se alag hona shuru hua, jisase antat vishaal mahadwipon loresia or gondvanaa kaa vikaas hua
 The rift that began to form between North America and Africa gave rise to many failed cracks
 a rift resulted in the creation of a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean
 atlantic mahaasaagar ek samaan rup se nahin khulaa tha; uttar-madhya atlantic main daraar bananaa shuru hua tha
 The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous
 loresia ne dakshinavart main ghoomana shuru kar diya tha, yah uttar main uttar america evam dakshin main uresia kii ore bad gaya
 The path of the Tethys Ocean was also closed due to the rise of Lauresia in a clockwise direction
 isi bich africa ke duusari taraf purvi africa, antarctic or madagascar ke nikatavarti hashiyon ke saath ek nayaa daraar bhi bananaa shuru ho gaya tha jisase dakshin-pashchimi hind mahaasaagar kii utpatti hui, yah bhi criteshas main khul rahaa tha
 The second important phase of the fragmentation of Pangea began in the early Cretaceous period, when the small giant continent Gondwana split into several continents

 Fluorostatics, fluid statics or hydrostatics is the science of the steady state of liquids and a subdivision of fluid mechanics
 is vigyaan main yah adhyayan kiya jaataa he ke kin halaat main koi taral padaarth yantric santulan main hone kii vajah se shant hota he
 Conversely, fluid dynamics is the branch of science in which moving, turbulent or discontinuous fluids are studied
 jab dore se bandhe batkhare aadi kisi baari pind ko pani main dubokar dore ko pakade rahete hai, tab dekha jaataa he ki itnaa bal nahin lagaana padataa, jitna bal us pind ko pani se baahar khinch lene par lagata he
 The reason why this happens is first discovered by the mathematician Archimedes and theorized that the fluid exerts a vertical exerting force on a body immersed in a fluid, which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body
 utkshep kaa nidaan karte samay taral daab kii sankalpana saamne aati he, arthath ek aise bal kii jo taral apane se sampark main aae hue pind ke prayek prishth alpaansh par lagaataa he
 The existence of such pressure gives us the impression that force is required to stop the water coming out of the hole
 archimedies ke niyam kii vyakhya is pariklpana ke aadhaar par di ja sakati he ki taral daab taral ke samparkwaale pind ke prishth-alpaansh par lambat: kriya karata he
 To bring clarity to the concept of pressure, the pressure intensity is defined by saying that it is the limit of the ratio of the force exerted by the liquid to the area of the surface, when the area moves towards zero
 prachandta kii sakanlpana kaa ek mahatvapurn laabh yah he ki taral ke prayek bindu par iskaa maan gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be proved that at a point of liquid the pressure of pressure in all directions is equal and it is called the hydrostatic daw at that point
 sanketakshar p dwaara ise prakat karte hai
 The amplitude of this pressure is the force per unit area
 yah bhi siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki yadi drav kaa ghanatv achar he, to daab gaharaai kaa samaanupati he or kshaitij tal main samaan rahata he
 According to this principle only - 'khojahi Dadak Sada Nija Level'
 jalprabandh main is gun kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or utsrut coop bhi isi kaaran chal pate hai
 Based on this, Leonardo de Vinci posited a law of transmittance of fluid pressure that if at any point in the fluid without increasing the geometric limits, the pressure is automatically increased at each point of the fluid
 bal kaa pariman daab or kshetrafal ke gunanfal ke baraabar hone ke kaaran chote kshetrafal par thodaa bal lagane kaa parinaam vahi hota he, jo bade kshetrafalke piston par bade bal ke lagane kaa
 Hydraulic claim, brake etc
 are based on this rule

 In SI method of liquid pressure, the unit is new / m / which is also called Pascal! And it is shown by PA! Its dimensional formula is ML-1T-2

 If a flushed body is given different positions in which the fluid displaced by it is equal to the weight, then the point of the buoyancy center is called the buoyant plane and the position of the body in equilibrium is the position in which between the buoyancy center and the center of gravity of the body
 The distance is maximum or minimum
