 samaas kaa taatpary he ‘sankshipteekaran’
 a new and meaningful word consisting of two or more words is called compound
 jaise - ‘rasoi ke liye ghar’ ise ham ‘rasoighar’ bhi kah sakate hai
 Samas is used extensively in Sanskrit and other Indian languages
 german aadi bhashaaon main bhi samaas kaa bahut adhik prayog hota he
 The word formed from the rules of compound is called composite word
 ise samastapad bhi kehete hai
 After compounding, the signs of fractions disappear
 jaise-raajputr
 Explaining the relationship between composite words is called homology
 vigrah ke pashchaat samasik shabdon kaa lop ho jataahe jaise-raaj+putr-raja kaa putr
 There are two terms in compound
 pehle pad ko purvpad or duusare pad ko utaarpad kehete hai
 Like Ganges water
 isamen ganga purvpad or jal utaarpad he
 In Sanskrit, samasas are used a lot
 anya bhartiya bhashaaon main bhi samaas upyog hota he
 a phrase in Sanskrit about Samas is famous: samaas ke chah bhed hai: The compound whose first term is predominant and it is avayam is called avayavibhava samas
 jaise - ythamati, aamaran inamen yatha or aa avyay hai
 Where there is a repeated frequency of the same word, avayabhavam is compounded like - day, day, overnight, house to house, hands and hands etc
 kuch anya udhaaharan - Recognition of impersonal compound - In this, all the stanza becomes avayya, that is, after applying the compound, its form never changes
 iske saath vibhakti chihn bhi nahin lagata
 Like - is all the words above
 parak Tattpurush Samas - The community which is headed by Uttar Pradesh and the former is secondary, it is called Tatpurush Samas
 jaise - tulsidaskrut = tulsidas dwaara krit Kshatavya - The factor that appears in the Deity is a compound with the same factor
 vibhaktiyon ke naam ke anusaar tatpurush samaas ke chah bhed hai- The compound in which the first term is prohibitive is called nay tatpurush samas
 jaise - The compound which is the head of the Uttar Pradesh and the relation of the adjective-adjective or upman-upmayya in the predecessor and the north-east is called Karmadharya Samas
 jaise - The compound whose predicate is a numerical adjective is called Dwigas
 isse samooh athwa samaahaar kaa bodh hota he
 like - jis samaas ke donon pad pradhan hote hai tathaa vigrah karne par ‘or’, athwa, ‘yaa’, evam yojak chinh lagate hai, vah dwandv samaas kehalaata he
 Such as parents, siblings, kings and queens, sorrows, jis samaas ke donon pad apradhan hon or samastapad ke arth ke atirikt koi sankethik arth pradhan ho use bahuvrihi samaas kehete hai
 like - karmdharay main samast-pad kaa ek pad duusare kaa visheshan hota he
 It has a semantic head
 jaise - nilkanth = nila kanth
 In polygamy, the adjective-adjective is not related to both the terms of all the posts, but that whole verse is the adjective of any other cognate
 iske saath hi shabdaarth gaun hota he or koi bhinnarth hi pradhan ho jaataa he
 Like - Neel + Kantha = Blue is Kantha whose Shiva
 
 Pact is in varnas
 isamen vibhakti yaa shabd kaa lop nahin hota he
 Such as - Dev + Alaya = Devalaya
 samaas do padon main hota he
 On concatenation, inflection or words are also omitted
 jaise - mata or pita = mata-pita

 The business background of the Ruia family dates back to the early nineteenth century as members of the powerful Marwari merchant community that gave birth to Indian financial dynasties such as the Birla and Mittal families
 haalanki aadhunik essar samooh ke vikaas kaa armbh 1950 ke dashak main hua jab nand kishor ruia ne tamilnadu kshetra ke chennai main apana kaarobaar sthapit karne ke liye rajasthan se ravaanaa hue

 At the twentieth of their age, the two Ruia brothers took the lead in expanding the family business and developing it into one of India's most successful and most diversified collective companies
 In the late 1960s, the two brothers had already targeted the shipping market and launched Essar-bulk cargo carriers in 1969

 And Panvel Creek, a one km long ethylene pipeline crossing to Bombay for Polyolefins Industries Limited which was completed in 1990

 1999 main group surkiyon main tha jab yah eurobond rin main lagbhag 250 million dollar kaa bhugtan na kar paane ke liye majaboor ho gaya
 Renewed development in the 21st century Part of the troubles of the Essar Group was related to its rapid diversification
 jaisaa ki ravi ruia ne 1994 main patrakaron ko company kii ranneeti ke bare main bataaya tha ki "ham kisi bhi nae vyavsaay main pravesh kar sakate hai jisase hamen adhik dhan praapt ho

html # ixzz1c2okkn9h Template: Essar Group kisi sanghathan main kisi karmchaaree kaa pad badalakar use usase upar vaala pad dena padonnati kehalaata he
 The efficiency of the personnel working in any organization is also affected by their level of satisfaction and morale
 padonnati arthath 'pad kii unnati' aadhunik carmik prashasan kaa mahatvapurn aayam he
 Promotion is related to increasing the rank, level of respect or to proceed on merit
 padonnati ko 'aantarik bhartee' yaa 'apratyaksh bhartee' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Promotion has the following characteristics or characteristics - padonnati to vartmaan pad se ucch pad ke praapt hone se sambaddh he
 On attaining a higher position, the pay scale, liability and new designation are payable to the promoted personnel and this increases the level of both the prestige and satisfaction of the employee
 padonnati prakriya kii upyogita nirvivaad rup se mahatvapurn he
 Due to promotion, on one hand the sustenance of the organization is maintained, on the other hand the ambitions of the employees are also fulfilled
 sankshep main, padonnati ke nimna mahatv hai – Nowadays 'anonymous interview' is becoming popular to know the qualification of the candidate accurately
 isamen ummidavaar ko yah pataa nahin rahata he ki uski pariksha lee ja rahi he
 It happens that when the post is vacant, the recruiter keeps an eye on the potential candidates and when some such people come to his attention, he organizes a special speech
 yahan sambhavit ummidavaaron ko bhaashan dene ke liye aamantrit kiya jaataa he
 This method makes it easy to evaluate the overall side of the personality of the candidate
 bharat main padonnati do prakaar kii hoti he – Two major principles of promotion are in vogue - varishthata par aadhaarit padonnati ek paramparaagat evam saral pranali he
 Accordingly, the first promotion will be given to the person whose service period will be longer than others
 varishthata ke aadhaar par padonnati kii shuruuaat east india company ke shasankaal main hi ho chuki thi
 This principle believes in awarding experienced personnel
 is prakaar kii padonnati main nishpakshta, carmik uplabdhta, swachaalan, manobal nirmaan, nyaay–sthapana, ahan takaraav se bachaav aadi laabh yaa gun hai to duusari ore dosha bhi bahut hai
 Qualified personnel in the organization prefer to go out due to promotion due to seniority
 bahut se karmchaaree kaary main ruchi bhi nahin lete hai kyonki padonnati to niyat samay par mil hi jaati he
 Fisher, the naval chief of Britain, once said - The British Empire will be destroyed, because it follows the principle of seniority
 vastut : varishthata kaa siddhanth pratyaksht: yogyata kaa shaman bhi hoga hi
 The First Pay Commission had suggested that there should be prudent coordination between direct recruitment and promotion in public services
 ayog kaa maananaa tha ki ucch padon ke sandarbh main padonnati ke liye varishthata ke sthaan par yogyata ko praathamikta di jaani chahie
 The merit-based promotion system is now gaining recognition
 vartmaan pratispardhaatmak pravritiyon se yukt samaaj main yogyata ko manyata milanaa swaabhaavik he
 Based on the merit in promotion, ambitious, dedicated and enthusiastic personnel are motivated, administrative work efficiency is increased and innovation or change processes can be implemented in administration, but due to this principle when less junior person rises to higher position So senior personnel are ego hurt as well as non-cooperation and conflict prone They wear the trunk
 pro vilobi ne padonnati ke liye paatrata ke do aadhaaron kaa varnan kiya he – At the time of post classification, the functions, responsibilities and qualifications of each post are determined
 in yogyataon main gyaan, kushalta, anubhav, shaikshanik yogyata, ling, nivas, takneekee kushalta aadi pramukh hoti he
 All the necessary qualifications for the post for which it is promoted must be in the respective candidate
 inke bina padonnati ke liye kisi karmchaaree ke naam ke sambandh main vichaar hi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 When these necessary qualifications are determined, then it is decided whether the field of candidates for promotion will be wide or narrow
 vyaktigat yogyataon kii bhaanti padonnati kii paatrata kaa ek anya aadhaar pratyaashiyon kii seva kaa str he
 Under this, it is determined from where the potential candidates for promotion will be obtained
 praaia: seva ke niyamon main hi nirdhaarit kar diya jaataa he ki kisi vishesh pad ke rikt sthaan kii purti ke liye padonnati usee pad ke turant neeche vaale pad se kii jaaegi yaa sanghathan ke kisi bhi karmchaaree se kii jaaegi yaa us beuro ke kisi karmchaaree se kii jaaegi jiskaa vah sanghathan ang maatr he yaa sambandhit vibhaag ke kisi bhi karmchaaree se yaa sampoorn sarkari seva ke kisi karmchaaree se kii jaaegi
 The lines of promotion become clear once these options are fixed
 padonnati kii paatrata ke kshetra par praaia: ek sanghathanaatmak pratibandh lagaaya jaataa he or padonnatiyaan saadhaarant: ek hi vibhaag athwa beuro ke antargat kii jaati he, antar-vibhageeya padonnatiyon kaa samarthan nahin kiya jaataa he
 The disadvantage of this system is that as a result of this, the opportunities for promotion of employees are reduced, as well as the possible field of qualified candidates is also reduced
 ukt laabhon tathaa haniyon kaa saapekshik prabhaav is baat par nirbhar karata he ki seva athwa sanghathanaatmak ikai kaa kshetra kitna vyapak he
 Prof
 Willoughby believes that there is a huge difference in the conditions of service of various employees, so it would be fatal if they tried to establish a uniform system for all of them
 is drushti se kuch saamaanya siddhanth nirdhaarit kiye ja sakate hai, ye nimnlikhit hai – The failure of the promotion system is often due to social, economic and political reasons
 kabhi–kabhi yah isliye bhi ho jaati he ki sevi varg prabandh upyukt padonnati vyavastha kii moolbhoot visheshtaon se parichit nahin hota he
 Prof
 Willoughby briefly mentioned these characteristics as follows - ukt visheshtaon ko apnaane ke baad yah bahut kuch nishchit ho jaataa he ki karmchaariyon kii padonnati ek vaigyanik aadhaar par ho sakegi or vibhinn ucch padon par na keval yogya vyaktiyon ko niyukt kiya ja sakenge varan sambandhit tathaa sambhavit karmchaariyon ke man main isaki nishpakshta ke prati santosh kii bhaavana bhi jaagrath kii ja sakegi
 Every officer will have an effective motivation to do the best work with this relationship, because he will not only complete the tasks of the current post but will also be ready for the future post
 adarsh padonnati vyavastha ke do pahalu he – Keeping both these things in mind, Stall has mainly presented the following suggestions which can be implemented by adopting the model promotion system - yah upwas saptaah ke duusare diwas mangalvaar ko rakhaa jaataa he
 a childless Brahmin couple were very sad
 brahman van main puja karne gaya or hanuman ji se putr kii kaamana karne laga
 His wife also used to fast on Tuesday to get a son at home
 mangalvaar ke din vrath ke ant main hanuman ji ko bhoga lagaakar bhojan karti thi
 Once, on the day of fasting, the Brahmin could neither cook nor offer food
 tab usne pran kiya ki agle mangal ko hi bhoga lagaakar ann grahan karegi
 She became unconscious by the time of a thirsty six days of hungry thirst
 hanuman ji uski nishtha or lagan ko dekhakar prasann ho gayi
 Visiting him said that they are happy with him and will give him a child, who will serve him
 iske baad hanuman ji use balak dekar antardhan ho gayi
 The Brahmin became very happy with it and named the child Mangal
 kuch samay uparaant jab brahman ghar aayaa, to balak ko dekh poocha ki vah koun he
 The wife told the whole story
 patni kii baton ko chal purna jaan brahman ne sochaa ki uski patni vyabhichaarini he
 One day, seeing the opportunity, the Brahmin dropped Balam into a well and the Brahmin panicked when the wife asked him at home
 peeche se mangal muskura kar aa gaya
 The Brahmin was surprised
 raat ko hanumanji ne use sapane main sab katha bataayi, to brahman ati harsith hua
 Then the couple started living a life of happiness by fasting on Mars
 is katha kaa mangalvaar ke din upwas rakhkar hi kiya jaataa he jo adbhut mangal kaari he ye katha bhaguan shri krishna ne abhimanyu se kahi thi

 har manushya main jeenon kaa diene gun sutron main hota he or mata or pita donon se mili hue diene kaa mishran hota he
 But the DNA of man's two places is not mixed
 pehla, stri or purushon donon main mitocandria kaa diene keval unki mata se aata he
 Second, only the DNA of his quality formula among men comes from his father
 mitocandria or waahe gun sutara ke diene main dasiyon hazaron saal tak koi bada parivartan nahin hota or puri manushya jaati kaa mitocandria or waahe gun sutara ke diene ke aadhaar par pitruvansh samoohon main or matruvansh samoohon main vargeekaran kiya ja saktaa he
 If two people have the same maternal lineage group, then it can be said that the mothers of these two are the offspring of the same woman living thousands of years ago
 agar kisi do purushon kaa ek hi pitruvansh samooh he to kaha ja saktaa he ke in donon ke pita hazaron saal purv jivit kisi ek hi pita kii santati hai
 Women do not have any relation with any ancestral group because women do not have the virtue formula
 aam taur par pita se putr tak waahe gun sutara kaa diene bina kisi mahatvapurn badlaav ke jaataa he
 But sometimes in a thousand years a mutation occurs in this DNA of a male, which brings out easily recognizable signs in it
 aisa lagbhag naammumkin he ki do purushon main ek jaisaa utparivartan ho 
 In future generations, every male who has this sign can be said that he is a descendant of the same first mutated man
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki is purush ne apana nayaa pitruvansh samooh sthapit kar liya he
 It is also seen that after thousands of years in the lineage of a mutated male, another new mutation may occur in a descendant male so that his own subfamilies can be easily identified
 ab is dusre purush ke aage chalakar jo vanshaj honge unamem pehle purush ke utparivartan ke bhi chinh honge or dusre purush ke utparivartan ke bhi
 It can also be seen that the members of the second ancestral group are the first descendants of the ancestral group

 anuvaanshiki or itihaas ke mili-jule adhyayan se yah pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he ke koun-sa utparivartan kis sthaan par or kis yug main hua
 Therefore, by looking at the DNA॰ of the virtue formula of any male, it can be told that his male ancestors settled in Africa and settled where and when
 udahaaran ke liye agar kisi bhartiya purush kaa pitruvansh samooh je2 he to kaha ja saktaa he ke bharat se pehle uske purush purvaj madhya purv or turki ke kshetra main rahete the, kyonki pitruvansh samooh je2 swayan pitruvansh samooh je kii shakha he jo madhya purv or turki main utpann hui
 The ancestral group j is a branch of self and ancestral groups that originated from the ancestral group F
 pitruvansh samooh fif ke bare main anumaan he ke yah bharat main armbh hua, lekin iske purvaj peeche chalakar africa se aaye the
 This process reveals the history of the male ancestors of this Indian man from the ancestral group J2 - they started in Africa a million years ago, then came to India, then turned west and settled near Turkey and then Returned to India
 dekha gaya he ke turki or iran main aaj bhi pitruvansh samooh je2 ke bahut purush hai
 So it can be said with the claim that about 20,000 years ago this Indian man and father of all these Turks, Iranians and Arab men were the same
 thik isi tarah matruvansh samoohon kaa bhi vriksh hota he or kisi bhi purush yaa mahila ko unka mitocandria kaa diene jaanchakar bataaya ja saktaa he ke unki purvaj matayen kaunse yugon main kaunse bhinn sthanon par basii hui thim

 Nirvana literally means 'extinguished'
 kintu buddha, jain dharm or vaidic dharm main iske vishesh arth hai
 The Shramana ideology has a state of freedom from suffering or grief
 paali main "nibbaan" kaa arth he "mukti paanaa"- yani, laalach, ghrinaa or bhram kii agni se mukti
 This is the ultimate truth of Buddhism and the main principle of Jainism
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa Although the use of the word nirvana in the sense of 'liberation' is found in the new and old texts of the Gita, Bhagavata, Raghuvansh, Shariak Bhashya, etc
, the term is the definition of Buddhists
 sankhya, nyaay, vaisheshik, yoga, mimasaa or vedant main kramshah moksh, apvarg, nickshreyas, mukti yaa swargaprapti tathaa kaivalya shabdon kaa vyavhaar hua he par buddha darshan main baraabar nirvana shabd hi aayaa he or uski vishesh rup se vyakhya kii gai he
 There are two main branches of Buddhism - Hinayana and Mahayana
 inamen se hinayan shakha ke sab granth paali bhashaa main hai or buddha dharm ke mul rup kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 The Mahayana branch is somewhat behind and all its texts are written in Sanskrit
 mahayan shakha main hi anek aacharyon dwaara buddha siddhanton kaa nirupan gudh tarkpranali dwaara darshanik drushti se hua he
 In ancient times, the Buddhist masters of Vedic Acharyas with whom they spoke were often from the Mahayana branch
 atah nirvana shabd se kya abhipraay he iskaa nirnay unheen ke vachanon dwaara ho saktaa he
 The Bodhisattva Nagarjuna has written in the Madhyamika Sutra that 'the eradication of bhavasantati is nirvana', that is, by our rites, we fall into the bondage of birth again and again, this eradication can destroy destruction
 ratnakutasutra main buddha kaa yah vachan haih raag, dwesh or moh ke kshay se nirvana hota he
 In the Bajrakshaika, the Buddha has said that nirvana is imperishable, there is no sacrament in it
 madhyamik sutarakaar chandrakirti ne nirvana ke sambandh main kaha he ki sarvaprapanchanivartak shoonyata ko hi nirvana kehete hai
 What is this emptiness or nirvana! Neither can it be called emotion, nor lack
 kyonki bhav or abhaav donon ke gyaan ke kshap kaa hi naam to nirvana he, jo asti or naasti donon bhaavon ke pare or anirvachaneey he
 Madhvacharya has also stated the same meaning of emptiness in his Sarvadarshanasangraha - 'asti, Nasti, Umbhaya and Anubhimaya are nothingness from this quadrant
 madhyamik sutara main nagarjun ne kaha he ki astitv or naastitiv kaa anubhav alpbuddhi hi karte hai
 Wise people get the welfare of both of them
 upyukt vaakyon se spasht he ki nirvana shabd jis shoonyata kaa bodhak he usase chitt kaa grahyagraahakasambandh hi nahin he
 i am false, the world is also false
 ek baat dhyaan dene kii he ki buddha darshanik jeev yaa aatma kii bhi prakrut satta nahin maanate
 They consider nothing more than a non-zero
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa The Buddha described nirvana as that ultimate peace of mind that goes beyond craving, anger and other agonizing states of mind
 aisa praani jisane jivan main shanti ko paa liya he, jiske man main sabhi ke liye dayaa ho or jisane sabhi ichchhaaon or bandhanon kaa tyaag kar diya ho
 yah shanti tabhi praapt hoti he jab sabhi vartmaan ichchhaaon ke kaaran samaapt ho jaaen or bhavishya main paidaa ho sakane vaali ichchhaaon kaa jad se naash ho jaae
 nirvana main trishna or dwesh ke kaaran jad se samaapt ho jate hai, jisase manushya sabhi prakaar ke kashton yaa sansar main punarjanm ke chakra se chhot jaataa he
 There are also other approaches to nirvana in Pali principles; According to one, it is the same as finding vacancies in any fact
 At the same time it is also shown as a whole rearrangement of consciousness and opening of layers of conscious
 vidwaan harbart gintar kaa kahana he ki nirvana se "adarsh vyaktitv, sachcha insaan" vaastaviktaa ban jaataa he
 In the Dhammapada, the Buddha says that nirvana is the "ultimate bliss"
 yah anand chirsthai or sarvopari hoti he jo gyanoday yaa bodhi se praapt hone vaali shanti kaa ek abhinn ang he
 This pleasure is completely different from the happiness of mortal things
 nirvana se judaa hua gyaan bodhi shabd ke madhyam se vyakt hota he
 The Buddha interpreted Nirvana as a "spontaneous" mind
 aisa man jo ichchhaaon ke ant ke kaaran purna spashtataa or subodhgamyata kii sthiti main pahunch gaya he
 Buddha described it as "deathlessness") and ultimate spiritual enlightenment, which is the natural result that one gets when leading a virtuous life and walking on the perfect eight-point ideal path
 aise jivan se karm or wan kii sandhi se bana he
 Nir means "separation, away or without" and Vana means "liberation" such as "flowing air" and "sniffing, etc
"
 abhidharm-mahavibhasha-shaastra, jo ek sarvastvaadi vichaar he, main is shabd ke sanskrit se utpann sabhi sambhavit arthon kaa varnan he: Nirvana has never been considered as a place in the sutras, rather it is considered a paradox of the world, which is actually synonymous with ignorance
 
 kaha gaya he: The exact meaning of nirvana is the attainment of knowledge - which eliminates the identity of the mind and creates an attachment to the basic fact
 saidhantik taur par nibbaan ek aise man ko kaha jaataa he jo "na aa rahaa he or na ja rahaa he " or usne shashvatata kii sthiti ko praapt kar liya he, jisase "mukti" milti he
 Stability, coolness and peace also have its meanings
 nirvana kii prapti kii tulana avidya ke ant se kii jaati he
 Which awakens the desire for that state of mind which frees the life cycle
 sansar mulat: trishna or agyanta kii upaj he 
 vyakti bina mrityu ke bhi nirvana kii prapti kar saktaa he
 When a person who has attained nirvana dies, that death is called moksha], because he is completely missed by the last connection of life and death and rebirth and is not born again
 Buddhism considers the end of worldly existence the ultimate goal and this is the attainment of nirvana; What happens after the death of such a person cannot be explained by parinirvāṇa, because this experience is beyond the limits of human understanding
 kai prashnon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se shariputt ne ek bhikshu se manvaaya ki tathagat ko apane vartmaan jivan main bhi satya yaa vaastaviktaa nahin mana ja saktaa, aise main arhant kii mrityu ke pashchaat kii sthiti par atakalein lagaana sahi nahin hoga
 dekhen tathagat # inascrooteble After attaining a level of knowledge, one experiences nirvana like mental consciousness
 kuch dharanaon ke anusaar agar nibbaan ke raste par chalaa jaae to ye arhant ko gyaan prapti or samadhi kii ore le jaataa he
 If the yogi realizes that this situation is artificial and therefore mortal, when reaching this state by the development of the inner being, then all the bonds end, the person becomes arahant and attainment of Nibbana
 man jaagruk he; yah chetan he
 Nirvana opens consciousness and the mind becomes free from all the shackles of this uneasy world and becomes aware
 buddha ne is baat kaa kai tarah se varnan kiya he
 One of these is as follows: chetana niraakaar he, iskaa koi ant nahin he or ye sabhi taraf se tejasvi he
 Ajan Pasanno and Ajan Amaro write that the term science is seen in terms of the quality of Chetan
 unke mutabik "vinyaan" ko uske shabdic arth se kahin adhik samajha janaa chahie: "buddha ne apane samakaksh kai darshanikon kii tarah vidya ke aadambar or paakhand ke bajaay ek bade daayre main aam logon kii samaj main aane vaali bhashaa kaa prayog kiya, jisase unka sandesh adhik se adhik samajha ja sake
 isliye 'vinyaan' ko yahaan par 'jaanane' ke arth main liya ja saktaa he, lekin aanshik tutaa-phuta, bhedbhaavparak jaananaa nahin, jo aamtaur par iskaa arth lagaaya jaataa he
 Rather it should mean preliminary and excellent knowledge, otherwise the contradiction will appear in the context in which it is being spoken
 "he then explained what could have been the reason behind the selection of these words
 This" latent consciousness "six senses Is different from the consciousness of others, the rest of the consciousnesses have a "surface", which causes a reaction
 peter harvey ke anusaar pracheen granthon main is mudde par do raay he ki "chetan" shabd sateek he yaa nahin
 ek mukt vyakti iskaa sahaj rup se anubhav karata he
 According to one interpretation, "prakaswan Chetan" is similar to Nirvana
 duusare isse sahamat nahin he, unke anusaar ye nirvana nahin he, balki ye ek prakaar kii chetana he jo keval arhantko hi praapt hoti he
 In the Majjhima Nikaya it is described as a blank space
 mukt vyaktiyon ke liye nibbaan se judi hui prakashwan sahaj chetana, maansik chetana ke dhyaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or ye maansik chetana ke sabhi bhaagon se utkrisht hoti he
 This is completely different from the concept of enlightenment of the former Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, which speak of awakening the inner consciousness of a person, while it does not emphasize this aspect and is not confused with "self" in any way
 needed
 Furthermore, according to the sixth meditation of the Buddha, it excels in the field of unlimited consciousness, which itself does not end on the pretense of "I"
 nagarjun ne bhi dignikaay main chetana ke str par do sthanon par sanket die hai
 He wrote: sadhu ne ghoshnaa kii ki prithvi, jal, agni or vaayu, lanbaa, chota, maheen or kadaa, acha ityadi sabhi chetana main bujh jate hai
 

 Here long and short, fine and hard, good and bad, all these names and forms cease
 isi se judaa vichaar, jise paali siddhant or samakaleen therwaad main samarthan mila he, jabaki therwaad bhashya or abhidhamm main iskaa ullekh nahin dikhataa, ye kahata he ki arhant kaa man hi nibbaan he
 In Mahayana Buddhism, both nirvana and samsara are seen as the ultimate nature of dharmakayi, both of them are not separate
 ek vyakti buddha path se nirvana kii prapti kar saktaa he
 It would not have been possible if these two were completely different
 That is, the dualism of nirvana and samsara is traditionally accurate
 is nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa ek or rasta yah vishleshan he ki sabhi tathy ek aavashyak pahchaan se rikt hote hai, isliye pidaa kisi bhi paristhiti main janmajaat nahin hoti
 isliye du:kha or uske kaarnon se mukti koi abhautik prakriya nahin he
 For further explanation of this idea, see Dualism
 theravadamat sansar or nibbaan ke bich paraspar virodhabhas ko darshata he, jahaan se mukti kii khoj shuru hoti he
 At the same time, this contradiction also leads to the ultimate goal, which is to truly excel in the world and attain salvation through Nibbana
 theravadakai myanon main mahayan mat se bhinn he, jo khud bhi sansar or nirvana ke dwaitvaad se shuru hota he, is dhruvikaran ko yah sirf ek aarambhik paath ke taur par nahin dikhaata he, balki aage jaakar ye advaitvaad ke vrihad anubhav kii ore le jaataa he
 From the point of view of the Pali Sutra, the sufferings and stagnation of Buddha and Arhant, i
e
 samsara and nibbana are different
 donon hi mat is baat par sahamat he ki shakya muni buddha isi sansar main rahete hue nirvana ko praapt hue, kyonki unhen sabhi ne sansar se mukt hote hue dekha tha
 Vishuddhimarg Ch
 I, v
 6, Buddhaghosha has shown several options in the Pali doctrine for the path of Nirvana, including: kisi ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par, ye sabhi vikalp buddha ke bataae gunon, maansik vikaas or gyaan ke teen sutreey shiksha ko hi nae sire se dikhalaataa he
 The idea of showing Nirvana as a pure, non-dualistic 'transcendent mind' is also found in Mahayana / Tantric texts
 samput, udhaaharan ke liye, yah varnan karata he: Empty from lust and emotional defect, on which there are no clouds of dualistic outlook, such an excellent mind is indeed the ultimate nirvana
 ' According to some Mahayana traditions, Buddha is seen in the Marichika, in which the visible person is shown as rising above the state of nirvana
 professor atian lamote ke anusaar, buddha hameshaa or har samay nirvana main rahete hai or unka bhautik sharir or dharti par rup vastav main chhadam he
 Lamote writes of the Buddha: 'he was born, he attained enlightenment, he pursued the cycle of dharma and attained nirvana
 However, this is all an illusion: Buddha's precept is the omission of the stages of coming, staying and going; His nirvana indicates that he is always and at all times in a state of nirvana
 ' Some Mahayana sutras try to explain the characteristics of the nature of Nirvana going forward
 mahayan mahaparinirvana sutara, ke mukhya vishyon main mulat: nirvana kii seemaa yaa dhaatu hi he, isamen buddha chaar aavashyak ghatakon kii charchaa karte hai jisase nirvana kaa nirmaan hota he
 One of which is 'self', which is analyzed as Buddha's permanent self
 mahayan ke aadhaar par nirvana ko samajhaate hue wiliam edward soothilaur lui hods kehete hai: 'nirvana Sutras claim that ancient ideas like stability, ecstasy, personality, purity lead to excellent nirvana
 mahayan ye ghoshnaa karata he ki hinayan, ye nakaarte hue ki utkrisht kshetra main koi vyaktitv hi nahin hota, darasal buddha ke astitv ko hi nakaarte hai
 In Mahayana, the ultimate nirvana is transcendent and is labeled the ultimate
 ' When this scripture was written, many positive things had already been said about Nirvana and Buddha
 buddha dharm ke shuruaati vichaar ke anusaar, nirvana ko sthayitv, harsh or shuddhta se darshaya gaya he
 It is shown to be in retaliation for the "I am" posture and is beyond all possibilities of self-development
 mahaparinirvana sutara, jo mahayan kaa lanbaa or vrihad shaastra he, buddha ko gaiyr-buddha logon par vijay ke liye "swayan" kaa prayog karte hue dikhaaya he
 From this it is further stated: "buddha's nature is not his own
 samvedansheel praaniyon ke maargdarshan ke liye swayan kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 " isi se judaa shaastra ratnagotra vibhaag, kahata he ki tathagatagarbha kii shikshaayen samvedansheel praaniyon ko jeetne kii drushti se or "swayan se judaav" ko samaapt karne ke liye he - gaiyr buddha shiksha kii paanch main se ek kami
 lankavatar sutara main yoru vaing ne bhi aisi hi bhashaa kaa prayog paaya he, phir likhte hai: "ye dekhte hue ki ye sandarbh aavashyak he
 This will prevent us from coming to the conclusion that from the idea of tathagatagarbha it was just a supernatural fantasy
 " haalanki, kuch logon ne mahaparinirvana sutara se jude is nishkarsh par aapatti kii he or daawa kiya he ki buddha ne in panktiyon main swayan kii vaastaviktaa par bal dete hue ghoshnaa kii he ki wo hi swayan hai: 'due to many reasons and circumstances, i also taught that myself is beyond myself
 jabaki vastav main swayan he, maine ye sikhaaya ki koi swayan nahin he lekin isamen kuch galat bhi nahin he
 Buddha-metal is self-contained
 jab tathagat ye shiksha dete hai ki koi swayan nahin he, to wo aisa anadi ke kaaran karte hai
 The Tathagata are themselves and they teach not to be themselves because they have attained sovereignty
 ' The Buddha in the Nirvana Sutra states that he will now teach the principles kept secret so far and his earlier teaching on non-self was based on justification
 dow kosho yamamoto likhte hai: 'he says that the non-self he taught earlier is nothing but justification in that context
 

unhone ye bhi bataaya ki ab wo gopneey gyaan ke bare main baat karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 The person also follows contrary thoughts
 to ab vah nirvana ke sakaaratmak gunon kii baat karenge, jo kuch or nahin balki shaashvat, harsh or shuddh hi hai
 ' kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar, tathagatagarbha prakruti ke sutron main jis bhashaa kaa prayog kiya gaya he unamem sakaaratmak bhashaa main ashrith utpatti se buddha shiksha par jor dikhataa he jisase log buddha dharm se dur na hone lag jaaen or is shiksha ko nihilism ke samaan na samaj baithen
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch sutron main gaiyr-swayan ke purna gyaan ko hi sachcha swayan kaha gaya he; is path ke param lakshya ko phir kaaphi sakaaratmak bhashaa se samajhaayaa gaya he jo bharat ke darshan shaastra main upyog kii jaati rahi he, lekin ab ise nai buddha shabdaawalee kaa hissaa bana liya gaya jisase us vyakti ke bare main samajhaayaa ja sake jisane buddha path ko safaltaapurvak purna kar liya ho
 Dr
 Yamamoto explains that the 'positive' depiction of nirvana is in fact associated with a higher degree of nirvana - called 'mahanirvana'
 nirvana sutara ke 'bodhisattva mahaan paramatma raja' paath ke bare main baat karte hue yamamoto khud hi dharmagranth kaa sahaara lete hai: 'nirvana kya he? 


ye kuch isi prakaar he ki bhukhe vyakti ko wo shanti or harsh mil jaae jaise uske pet main kuch bhojan chalaa gaya ho
' yamamoto uddhran jari rakhte hai, saath hi apni tippanee bhi jodate hai: "but, such nirvana cannot be called" Mahanirvana "
 And he also contemplates "maha Swayam", "maha Harsha" and "maha Purity" which are the four qualities of Maha Nirvana like all Sanatana
 ' According to some scholars, the interpretation of "self" here and in related formulas does not in fact represent enough self
 darasal, yah ek sakaaratmak bhashaa main riktata kii abhivyakti he or buddha prathaon ke madhyam se buddhatv kii prapti kaa suchak he
 In this view the aim of 'tathagata Garbha' / Buddha's teaching is liberation-scriptural and not theoretical
 baharhaal, ye vyakhya vivaadaaspad he
 Not all scholars have this opinion
 nirvana sutara or sambandhit shastron main tathagatagarbha siddhant ke vividh gyaan par likhte hue, dow jemi habird kehete hai ki kis tarah kuch viddhan tathagatagarbha main param tatvvaad or advaitvaad kii prakruti kii taraf jhukaav pate hai 
 dow habird kii tippaniyan: 'matsumoto said that there are many similarities in the very positive language and motivational way of knowledge in the Tathagata Garbha
 saath hi unhen atman / brahman parampara main paryaapt advaitvaad dikhaa
 jaahir he, matsumoto ne hi sirf is samanta kaa ullekh kiya he, aisa nahin he
 For example, Takasaki Jikido, who is considered a scholar of the Tathagatagarbha tradition, saw Advaitaism in the doctrines of the Tathagatagarbha and Mahayana 


 Obermiller in his translation linked the notion of the Advaita supreme principle to the Tathagatagarbha tradition and commented on the Ratnagotra
 , Which he aptly named as "the Manual of Buddhist Monotheism"
 

lamote or frowalnar ne tathagatagarbha siddhant ko madhyamika se thik ulat bataaya or unhone use atman / brahman ke advaitvaad se judaa hua bataaya, jabaki nagaao, sefort royag or jonston jaise kuch logon ne sirf apane andeh jaahir kiye or kaha ki ye vedon ke samay ke baad ke advaitvaad se mail khaataa he
 Another view, represented by Yamaguchi Susumu and his student Ogawa Ichijo, succeeded in understanding Tathagatagarbha without Vedic ideas and found it only in the Buddhist tradition of emptiness and causality that outrightly rejects any monotheism
 
 jaahir he, tathagatagarbha or buddha parampara kii advaitvaad yaa shaashvat prakruti se jude prashn jatil hai
 Dr
 Hubbard summarizes his research on the principles of Tathagatagarbha with these words: 'tathagatagarbha kaa gyaan hameshaa se hi bahes kaa mudda he, kyonki vah satya or gyaan ke liye behad moulik sakaaratmak drushtikon rakhata he, vaastaviktaa kaa varnan nakaaratmak sandarbh main nahin yani jo usamen kami he yaa riktata he uske sandarbh main nahin, balki sakaaratmak varnan jaisaa ' According to Paul Williams, congruence can be explained in monotheism of Atman / Brahmin thought
 jab nirvana sutara gaiyr buddha saadhuon ko jeetne ke liye apni shiksha saamne rakhe: At this time there is something interesting about the Hindu influence on Buddhism
 lekin sirf prabhaavon kii baat karnaa behad aasaan he
 

 Saying this, the Mahaparinirvana Sutra itself assumes a kind of Hindu influence, when it speaks of the Buddha using 'himself' to conquer non-buddhist monks
 phir bhi, ye sochna galat hoga ki advait vedant ke utkrisht swayan brahman is samay buddha dharm ko prabhavit karte hai
 It is not clear anywhere that the self which means in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra can be compared to the Advaita Brahman anywhere and this Tathagatagarbha Sutra is older than the Gaud verse, which is called the founder of Hindu Advaitaism
 sutara ye bhi kahata he ki buddha kii prakruti vastav main swarahit he, lekin baatcheet ke aadhaar par ye swayan kehalaati he
 In the second section of the same sutra, it is stated that there are three ways by which a person can "get" something; Achieve in the past, achieve in the present and achieve in the future
 It states that "all have the nature of Buddha" means that all will become Buddha in future 

 However, Dozen has clearly stated that the nature of Buddha is present in some contexts even in the present -also in Buddhism: Actually comparing reality with the present, it was linked to Buddha nature, which included grass, trees, mind and body all
 dojan ke liye kisi bhi vastu ko dekhnaa athwa buddha kii prakruti ko dekhnaa he
 Whereas Chinul believes that it exists in the body like the ability to smell and see
 mahatvapurn lankavatar sutara main kaha gaya he ki sabhi kaary buddha kii prakruti ke kaaran hai, har karm kii niyati yahi kaaran or jad he
 As suggested above, the Japanese Zen Guru Dozen has a completely different interpretation of Buddha nature, in which the 'whole form' is seen as Buddha nature and nothing is different from it
 The nature of Buddha is not just about 'ability to be Buddha', but it is the nature of everything in the world
 sabhi vasteen apane asthayitv main buddha prakruti kii tarah dekhi gai hai or wo kisi buddha prakruti ke liye 'kshamta' kaa pramaan nahin he
 Dr
 Masao Abe writes on this understanding: '


 dojan kii samaj main, buddha prakruti kisi kshamta kaa pramaan nahin, wo koi beej nahin he jo har samvedansheel vyakti ke paas ho
 balki har samvedansheel vyakti, yaa kahen har vastu, jivit yaa mrit asal main buddha prakruti hi he
 This is not an ability which will show form in future, this is the basic nature of everything
 dojan ne is tarah buddha prakruti or 'samvedansheel vyaktiyon' ke vichaar ke daayre ko badhaate hue, lagbhag sari chizon ko samet liya, wo sari chijen jo jivit hai, jinamein buddhi he or jo buddha prakruti hi hai
 Dr
 Masao Abeis explains: '


 dojan ne na sirf buddha prakruti ke arth kaa dayera badhaayaa he, balki samvedansheel vyaktiyon ko bhi vrihadata pradaan kii he
 In "busho", "the whole personality is the nature of the Buddha
" " ye kehane ke fouran baad wo kehete hai, "main sampurna vyakti kii 'samvedansheel praaniyon' kii ikai ko avibhajya maanata hum"


 yani dojan ne shujo kaa dayera badha diya he, jo paaramparik rup se keval jivit yaa samvedshansheel vyaktiyon ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa tha, ab isamen mrit or asamvedansheel vasteen bhi shaamil hai
 In other words, he has spoken of giving life in dead objects, giving feelings in insensitive things and finally giving Buddha and Buddha nature in all
 '
 In Jainism this means opening the last bond of karma
 When an enlightened human being such as an Arihant or Tirthankara destroys his remaining abrasive deeds / Ahagatya Karma thus ending his earthly existence, then this stage is called Nirvana
 takneekee taur par, ek arihant ke sharir ko tyaag dene ko athwa unke sharir kii mrityu ko nirvana kaha jaataa he, kyonki unhone sansar main apane astitv ko samaapt karke mukti ko paa liya he
 Moksha means liberation after liberation
 nirvana kii prapti ke baad ek arihant siddh ban jate hai, ek mukt vyakti
 Nirvana in Jainism means: jain dharm ko maanane vaale diwaali ko 24wein tirthankar mahavir bhagwaan ke nirvana kalyanak diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Nirvana Day is described as 'nirvana Kalyanak Divas' in Jainagam
 shwetambar manyata anusaar kalpasutra main mahavir ke nirvana par vistrut jaankaree he
 According to Shwetambara belief, it has been told in the Uttaradhana Sutra that how Gautama explained the meaning of Nirvana to KC, who was a disciple of the latter

 The Nadiadhikrit is a Sanskrit epic composed by Sriharsha
 yah vrihattrayee naam se prasiddh teen mahakvyon main se ek he
 The Nalopakhyana of Mahabharata is the root of this epic
 is granth ke do bhaag hai- purv or uttar
 There are 11-11 cantos in both
 At the end of this book it is not specified that 'the book is finished' - this is why the text is incomplete
 yah kavy kathin he kyonki kaha gaya he- naishadhan vidwadaushadham The poems created by the orgy poets of ornate poetry style dominated by ornamentation, the influx of narrative imagery inspired by the adult imagination, and the tendency of scholarly enlightenment, over-combining etc
 us ruchi kaa purna utkarsh sriharsh ke naishadheey charit main dekha ja saktaa he
 The great poet of this great epic of Brihattrayi, was a great scholar of justice, mimamsa, yogasastra etc
 and was the great Advaita Vedanti of logical method
 naishadh main shastreey vaidushya or kalpana kii atyucch udaan, aadyant dekhne ko milti hai
 The basic premise of this epic is the "nalopakhyana" of "mahabharata"
 mul katha ke mul rup main yathaavashyak parivartan bhi yatra-tatra kiya gaya he
 It seems that the popularity of this mythology has made it a folklore since ancient times
 is kaaran kavi ne vahaan se bhi kuch tatv liye
 This epic is Adyanta Shringari

 Shringarparikar's paintings have also added to that expansion
 apni kalpana kii udaan ke bal se pandit kavi dwaara ek hi chitra ko nai nai aprastut yojanaon dwaara anek roopon main vistaar ke saath rakhaa gaya he
 It seems that the poet's wisdom does not get tired of assessing a presentation one after another by the unprepared

 More than the Magh poet, Shri Harsha has greatly increased it with the addition of poetic performance of poetry, which has greatly increased the poetry of the short story
 shringaari vilaason or mukhyat: sanyog keliyon ke kushalshilpi or rasik nagaron kii vilasavritiyon ke ankan main aasanjansheel hokar bhi kavi ke darshanik vaidushya ke kaaran kavy main sthaan sthaan par rukshata bad gai
 Many defects like repetition, disunity, etc
 can also be found here

 It has adult classicalism and Kalpannamohar grandeur

 Both the expansion of the speech and the meaning of the speech are incompatible, the restrained and abstract speech is eloquence

 Anarchism can be understood in a very simple way from the story of one elephant and five blinds
 paanch andhe ek hathi ko choote hai or uske baad apane-apane anubhav ko bataate hai
 When a blind catches the elephant's tail, he feels that it is something like a rope, similarly the other blind person catches the elephant's trunk, he thinks it is a snake
 isi tarah tisare ne hathi kaa paanv pakadaa or kaha ki yah khambhe jaisi koi cheez he, kisi ne hathi ke kaan pakade to usne kaha ki yah koi soup jaisi cheez he, sabaki apni apni vyakhyaayein

 The second main branch of Christianity is called the Protestant and its followers do not accept the religious leadership of the Pope
 catholicon or protestanton kii dharmik manyataon main or bhi bade antar hai
 The Roman Catholic Church Jesus established a church for the teaching initiation of his future followers and appointed Saint Peter as its president
 sant peter kaa dehanth rome main hua tha jisase prarambh hi se rome ke bishap ko carch kaa paramadhyaksh mana jane laga
 The unity of this church could not remain intact due to many reasons
 pehle praachya carch rome se alag ho gaye
 Later Protestant religion emerged which resulted in the denial of the authority of the Bishop of Rome by a significant portion of the Western Church
