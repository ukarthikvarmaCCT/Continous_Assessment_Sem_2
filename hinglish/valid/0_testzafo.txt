 Also, in the seventh issue of the above drama, it is mentioned that Lachhiram made this drama and showed the ascetic Kavindra Saraswati
 kavindra saraswati ne 'yogavashthisar' kii rachana 1657 i

 Hence, the period of Karunabharan drama can be considered to be around 1657 AD

 Devidas and Devadatta Gurus can be names of the same person
 ye lachhiraam ke guru rahe honge or unheen ke kehane se naatak ko sukhaant banane ke liye saatven ank kii rachana kii gai hogi
 Although the Karunabharan drama is poetic and critics do not consider Brajbhasha poetic plays written on the style of management, even if the play was staged, evidence can be found

 Supported by: san 1905 main roosi samrajya ke ek vishaal bhaag main raajnneeti evam saamaajik janandolan hue jinhen 1905 kii roosi kranti kehete hai
 This revolution was against the government to some extent and directionless to some extent
 shramikon ne hadtaal kiye, kisaan aandolit ho uthe, sena main vidroh hua
 As a result, several constitutional reforms were carried out, the main ones being the establishment of the Duma of the Russian Empire, the multi-party political system, the Russian Constitution of 1906
 rus kii 1905 kii kranti ke kaaran uski raajnneetik, saamaajik paristhitiyon main nihit the
 The Japanese War served only as a catalyst
 yuddh main paraajay ke kaaran rus kii janata kaa asantosh itnaa bad gaya tha ki usne rajya ke viruddh vidroh kar diya
 Due to this revolution, the government had to stop the war with Japan and make a peace treaty
 is kranti ke kaaran nimnlikhit the - The war against Japan in Russia did not have public support
 rus kii janata yah nahin jaanati thi ki yuddh kis uddeshy se ladaa ja rahaa he
 The war was not managed efficiently
 bhrashtachar is seemaa tak bad gaya tha ki janata ne jo uphaar sainikon ke liye diye the, ve nagaron main khule aam beche ja rahe the
 Public disappointment was increasing with the defeat
 27 disambar ko samrat kii duusari ghoshan prakashit hui
 There were many restrictions placed on the reform program as if the freedom of the meetings could not be given
 isse rus kii janata ko maaloom ho gaya ki sarkaar apni shakti nirankush rakhana chaahati thi or sudhaar karne ke liye uski ichha nahin thi
 The reformists were not satisfied with Jar's declarations
 ab is andolan main shramik varg bhi sammilit ho gaya
 In January 1905 there were strikes in the capital St

 Under his leadership, workers of the capital made a strike with several demands
 vaarta asafal hone ke baad gepan ne jaar ke samaksh yachika prastut karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On Sunday, January 22, 1905, a procession of thousands of workers led by him was peaceful, but soldiers opened fire in front of the palace, killing hundreds of protesters
 is ghatana se kranti anrabh ho gayi
 The reformist movement had now clearly become a revolutionary movement

 The government paid no attention to it but published a declaration on its behalf on 6 August which stated the establishment of the Duma

 This was an unfinished effort of the government
 anudaarvaadiyon ko chhodkar kisi dal ne is yojana ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 The 1905 revolution had failed, but the reformists still had hope from the Duma
 sheeghra hi yah spasht ho gaya ki sarkaar apni ruchi kii duma chaahati thi
 The first duma was dissolved two months later
 iske sadasyon ne desh se sarkaar ke prati asahyog kii apil kii lekin desh andolanon se thak chukaa tha, atah iskaa prabhaav nahin padaa
 The government mercilessly crushed the Chhuput rebellion
 duusari duma main bhi sarkaar virdohi sadasyon kaa bahumat tha
 It was also dissolved
 iske baad sarkaar ne matadhikaar simit karke chunaav karaaye
 This gave the government supporters in the Third Duma a majority
 yadhyapi duma bani rahi lekin vah sarkaar se sahyog karti rahi or sarkaar kii ichha ke anusaar chaalati rahi
 The reasons for the failure of the revolution were as follows - 1905 kii kranti asafal hone ke baad rus main swechhachari shashan purna rup se sthapit ho gaya tha
 The policy of the regime was reactionary and repressive, but the survival of the Duma was quasi-constitutional in nature
 1912 i

 She also continued to cooperate with the government
 uske samay main pratham vishwayuddh main rus shaamil hua or 1917 main kranti hui
 The failures of the war created an atmosphere of mistrust

 Dardi or Dardic languages are a subdivision of indo-aryan languages, whose most well-known language is Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaayen uttari pakistan, uttar-purvi afghanistan or bharat ke jammu-kashmir rajya main boli jaatin hai
 Among all the Dardi languages, the status of Kashmiri is the highest because it has its own popular literature and also has the honor of being an official language of India
 pakistan ke chitral zile kii khovaar bhashaa, uttari kashmir main boli jane vaali shina bhashaa or afghanistan ke purvi nuristaan, nangarhaar or kunar rajyon main boli jane vaali pashai bhashaa anya mashhoor dardi bhashaayen hai
 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'drisha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"

 Some of the major organizations in affiliate organizations are - ye varg bauddhik or shaareerik rup se swayamsevakon ko sangh kii jaankaree to dete hi hai saath-saath samaaj, raashtra or dharm kii shiksha bhi dete hai
 They are of the following types: "pratham" or "dwitiya varg" 20-20 din ke hote hai, jabaki "tritiy varg" 25 dinon kaa hota he
 The district is usually organized by the "primary class", the "first union education class" is normally organized by the province, the "second union education class" is usually organized by the region
 parantu "tritiy sangh shiksha varg" har saal nagpur main hi hota he

 The Sangh believes that historically Hindus have always been neglected and oppressed in the country and it only talks about the legitimate rights of Hindus, on the contrary, its critics allege that the promotion of such ideas is India's secular The foundation is weak
 sangh kii is bare main manyata he ki hindutv ek jivan paddati kaa naam he, kisi vishesh puja paddati ko maanane waalon ko hindu kehete hon aisa nahin he
 Every person who considers India as his birth-land, mother-land and father-land, and considers it as a virtuous land; Is a Hindu sangh kii yah bhi manyata he ki bharat yadi dharmanirpeksh he to iskaa kaaran bhi keval yah he ki yahaan hindu bahumat main hai

 Surya Bharti Publications, 2596, New Road, Delhi-110006 leth mashin yaa kharad ek masini aujaar he jo aksh ke samamit rachana vaale saamaan banane ke kaam aati he
 In this, the body of metal keeps rotating on an axis and the tools for cutting, piercing and other activities are applied on it and it is given proper shape
 kharad ek aisa yantra he jis par gol anshon ko taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Nothing can be brought into the desired round shape with a hand device
 isliye isko kharad main bandha jaataa he, jo is cheez ko ghumata rahata he
 Then the tool is worked on
 jis mashin se yah sab kaam liya jaataa he usee ko kharad kehete hai
 a simple lathe is shown in the picture
 kharad ke bain ore iskaa shirodand he, jo taiyaar honevaale ang ko pakadaney or ghumaane kaa kaam karata he
 The meridian has a hollow spindle that rotates on two torches
 donon dharukon ke bich main takale par ek pad ghirani hoti he, jisapar praaia: teen pad hote hai, inhen padon se shirodand kii isha kii gati ko badhaayaa or ghataya ja saktaa he
 a similar pulley is also on the axis with which this lathe is driven by the motor
 ghirani ke upar ke patte ko ghirani ke ek pad se sarkaakar duusare pad par laane se kharad kii gati badali jaati he
 On the left edge of the spindle, there are chakras with teeth, which are called teeth
 inke dwaara kharad kii netrubhrami chalaai jaati he
 To cut bangles on a limb, it is necessary to use lead
 or isi se upkaran stambh apane aap chalata he
 The type of bangle to be cut will be used, but the number of bangles per inch will be arranged by denticles
 takale ke daahine kinare par kharad kaa chak hota he
 With this, we catch the thing on which to work
 chak praaia: do prakaar ke hote hai: The posterior instrument is the pillar
 yah stambh upkarnon ko pakadaney or unako thik sthiti main rakhane ke kaam aata he
 It consists of two chakras, which are operated by hand
 ek chakra se stambh ko kharad kii lambaai main chalaaya jaataa he or duusare chakra se upkaran ko kharad kii chaudaai main aage peeche kiya jaataa he
 Therefore the speed of cutting of the tool from the larger wheel and the depth of the cut from the smaller cycle are stabilized
 at: upkaran stambh kaa kaam kisi vastu par thik prakaar kii kaat lagaana he
 On the right side of the lathe there is an appendage, whose job is to aid the corpse; For example, if you have to work on a long object and it is caught only in the wheel, then the object will be bent when it is forced
 isliye aisi vastu ke duusare kinare ke bich chhed banaakar puchhdand ke centre se jamaa dete hai, tab yah vastu is centre par bhi gumti rahati he
 Due to this there is no fear of bending it
 kisi kharad kaa aakaar usapar kaam karanevaale angon ke naam se mana jaataa he
 If we say that the size of the lathe is 12 x 60 inches, it means that the largest function can be tied on this lathe with a diameter of 12 inches and a length of 60 inches
 is prakaar kii kharad ko falki kharad kaha jaataa he
 If more space is left in the lathe under the chuck of the corpus, due to which a work larger than the size of the lathe can be tied on it, it will be called an interval lathe
 kharad par kisi vastu ko baandhane kii teen reetiyaan hai: Binding the object to the centers of the chuck and the trunk is tightened by making holes between the diameters of the two sides of the object, mounting it at the centers of both punches
 yah kasaav puchhdand ke chakra ko ghumaane se hota he
 The tail can be folded back and forth according to the length of work
 kaam ko chak main bandhna or Tie the work on the mouthpiece
 jaisaa kaam hota he, waisi hi reeti kaa upyog hota he
 Due to the spindle hollow, it is convenient to hold long rods
 puchhdand kaa kaam keval kaam ko sanbhale rakhana hi nahin, balki chhed karnaa or bheetar ke vyas ko bada karnaa bhi he
 Many types of work are done on a lathe
 kisi vastu ko gol karnaa or usko ek vishesh vyas kaa bananaa, chuudi kaatna, kisi vastu par dhalaav bananaa, chote chhedon ko bada karnaa, bheetar ke vyas ko badhanaa tathaa isi prakaar ke anya duusare kaam kiye jate hai
 By first cutting deep on the object, it is kept just a little more than the size
 iske pashchaat kam kaat lekar kaam ko uske thik naap par laayaa jaataa he
 There are different tools for each type of chop
 jis prakaar kaa kaam karnaa ho usee prakaar ke upkaran ko kharid main lagaana padataa he
 The tool for cutting bangles is made of the same form as the bangles
 kharaadein kai prakaar kii hoti hai jinako yahan batalaana kathin he, parantu har kharad ke kaam karne kaa niyam vahi he jo upar batalaaya gaya he
 It is very important to keep some things in mind before working on a lathe
 kharad ko chalaane se pehle usko saaf karnaa or uske sab angon ko tel dena laabhadaayak tathaa aavashyak he
 Every part of the lathe works well by giving oil
 jis vastu par kaam ho rahaa he vah kaat lagane se garam ho jaati he
 If it is not frosted, the appliance will also become hot and its edge will be destroyed
 isse dhaatu ko kaatane main kathinaayee hogi or dhaatu bhi thik nahin cat paaegi
 Therefore, along with cutting the metal, oil is also given to it
 ek to yah tel upkaran ke kaam main suvidha karata he or duusare dhaatu ko thandha rakhata he
 This oil is specially made for this purpose
 is kaary ke liye sabun ko pani main gholkar bhi kam main laayaa jaataa he
 It has also been observed that some of the cloth of the worker working on the lathe got stuck in some moving part of the lathe and due to this an accident occurred
 isliye deele kapade pahanakar kharad par kaam karnaa thik nahin he
 It is also necessary to put a restriction on all the parts of the lathe
 dhaatu kaatanevaale sab upkarnon ko tej karte rahane se acha kaam hota he
 By taking fewer deep and short cuts, the metaphor of the work is good
 kuch kaarkaanon main kharaadon ko chalaane ke liye upar kii ore ek dhuree lagaai jaati thi, jisko ingine se chalaaya jaataa tha
 Many pulleys were placed on this axis and a lathe was run from each pulley
 is pranali ke upyog se kai kathinaaiyaan hoti thim, ek to yah ki yadi ek yaa do kharaadein chalaanaa ho to bhi usee shakti kaa ingine chalaanaa padataa tha jo sab kharaadon ko ek saath chalaane ke liye prayukt hota
 This cost more to run the lathes
 duusare, yadi ingine main koi kharabi aa gai to sab kharaadon kaa kaam ruk jaataa tha
 Thirdly, it also led to more accidents
 isliye aajkal is pranali kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa
 Now with each lathe comes its own motor, which is driven whenever necessary
 is prakaar har kharad kii shakti uske saath alag rahati he

 prashasnic sudhaar ayog ek samiti he jo bharat ke lok prashasan ko or adhik kargar banane ke liye suzav dene hetu bharat sarkaar dwaara niyukt kii gayi he
 The first Administrative Reforms Commission was appointed on 5 January 1966
 doosraa prashasnic sudhaar ayog 31 agast 2005 ko banaaya gaya tha
 Its president was Veerappa Moily
 aaj kaa rajya prashasnic rajya he
 Today administration deals with every aspect of human life
 naagarik prashasan ko ek aise naitik agent ke rup main dekhtaa he jo uski aavashyaktaaon kii purti karne ke liye he evam uski aakankshaon or lakshyon tak pahunchne main uski sahaayta karata he
 But the needs of the people are constantly changing and the administration cannot remain fixed
 ise aavashyak rup se parivesh ke anusaar badalanaa hi he
 Administration can either be self-contained or artificially modified
 kritrim rup se laae gaye parivartanon ko praayah 'prashasnic sudhaar' kehete hai
 Harald E
 Cowden - Administrative reform is the artificial motivation of administrative change against resistance
 arni epa
 limons- prashasnic sudhaar yatharthata or vaanchhneeyata ke bich ke antar ko paatane ke prayaas main sarkari tantra main kiya gaya abhiprerit parivartan he
 Based on the above definitions, we can identify the following interrelated qualities of administrative reform
 caden ke anusaar nimnlikhit kaarnon se prashasnic sudhaar aavashyak he- Due to this conservative trend, organizations turn their eyes towards the changes in the environment
 sanghathan spasht chetavanee sanketon kii tab tak upeksha karte hai jab tak ki samasya nidaan ke pare na chali jaae
 Due to this conservative trend, administrative reform becomes necessary
 upyukt teenon siddhant shaayad hi kabhi galat hote hon or lok prashasan ke adhyayan evam vyavhaar main prashasnic sudhaaron kaa sthaan ban gaya he
 Administrative reforms are constantly institutionalized as this need is realized
 prayek lok prashasan ko apana sudhaarak swayan hone ke liye prashikshit or protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he
 Every government organization is expected to have knowledge of state-of-the-art technology, promote innovative change and adopt commercially approved recommendations
 sankshep main, prashasnic sudhaaron kii sukalpana kaa aagaman ho chukaa he
 Administrative reforms can be of different types, considering its breadth and depth
 sudhaaron ko vargeekrut karne kaa ek tarika uski vishay vastu par dhyaan dena he
 In general, the following types of administrative reforms can be identified
 sanrachanaatmak sudhaar prayek prashasnic sanghathan kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn avyav sanrachana he, arthath ek aisi yukti jo sanghathan main kaary-vibhaajan, pratyaayojan evam vikendrikaran kii vyavastha karti he
 Structural reforms refer to such reform proposals that seek to bring about changes in the structure with the aim of increasing its effectiveness and efficiency
 prakriyaatmak sudhaar kisi bhi sanghathan main samay bitne ke saath prakriyaayein saansthanikrut ho jaati he jaise vittiya niyam, carmik nitiyaan, natthikaran paddatiyaan aadi
 Organizations want to stick to outdated processes
 prakriyaatmak sudhaar lalaphitaashahee ko dur karne ke prayaas main prakriyaaon main parivartan laana chaahate hai
 Example: The Staff Inspection Unit in India focuses on improving
 vyavahaarparak sudhaar sabhi bade sanghathan ek adhikari tantric sanrachana viksit karnaa chaahate hai
 In any official system, its impersonal character and individuals lack sufficient importance
 vyaktiyon ke amanavikaran ke kaaran adhikaritantra ke sadasyon main abhiprerana kaa abhaav utpann hota he jo logon ko unke dwaara di ja rahi sevtch kii gunvattta par pratyaksh prabhaav daalata he
 Behavioral reforms seek to reestablish the importance and dignity of the individual so that an atmosphere of unity and group harmony develops
 is prakaar ye sudhaar karmchaariyon ke abhiprerana staron par pratyaksh prabhaav daalate hai
 The different types of reforms described above may be considered separately or jointly
 yah kahana aavashyak nahin he ki yadi kisi ko sudhaaron se puraa-puraa laabh uthaanaa ho to sabhi sudhaaron par ek saath hi vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 On January 5, 1966, a highly empowered Administrative Reforms Commission was set up to make recommendations regarding reforms and reorganization in the administration of the country and administration as required
