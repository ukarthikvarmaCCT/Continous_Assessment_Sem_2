 In order to deal with these dire circumstances, Lenin adopted a new economic policy in 1921, called the 'new economic policy'
 yah aarthik niti marxvaadi siddhanton se samjhauta thi kyonki isamen puunjipatiyon kaa bhi sthaan surakshit rakhaa gaya

 acholkon ne ise poonjivadi ke aage bolshevik sarkaar kaa samarpan mana
 It is true that the new economic policy was different from the policy of warring communism as it accepted the capitalist system in part
 kintu lenin ise poonjeevaad ke samaksh bolshevik sarkaar kaa aatmasamarpan nahin maanata tha

 is sambandh main david thamsan ne likhaa ki is niti ke sarvaadhik naatakeey evam doorgaami prabhaavon main mahatvapurn yah tha ki aarthik niti ke parinamswaroop rus kaa punarnirmaan sambhav hua
 What Lenin said in the context of economic policy proved to be correct, that when Russia becomes economically competent, the communist system will be established in a completely powerful way
 bolshevik party ne lenin kii mrityu ke pashchaat 1925 ke baad iskaa parityag kar diya or kathor samyavaadee nitiyaan lagu kii
 Overall, the new economic policy helped the economy to improve with the chaos arising from the First World War and the destruction caused by the Revolution and the Civil War

 vastav main likene do purnataya bhinn vanaspatiyon se bana ek dwaidh padap hota he
 One of these flora is algae and the other is fungus, but both of them have such close association that the lichen made from them appears to be a single plant
 is saahchary main adhikanshat: kavak hi hota he, jo shaivalwale ang ke upar ek thile kii bhanti aavaran hota he tathaa thelas ke aakaar ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 The mixed growth of both flora gives lichen a special shape and internal structure, dividing lichen into several clans and species
 inke lagbhag 400 vansh or 15,000 spishiz gyaat hai
 The main part of lichen is made of fungal fibers, which are made of a mesh of fibers
 yah jaali praaia: ascomicitis varg ke kavak kaa vanaspatik bhaag hoti he
 Some of the fungi also belong to the genus Basidiomycetes
 likene ke upree str main in kavak tantuon se mishrit hare rang kii jo chlorophisi, yaa nile hare rang kii vanaspati, hoti he, vah mixofisi varg kii hoti he
 This blue, or green vegetation is unicellular and multicellular fibrous
 in vanaspatiyon main krookocas, cytonema athwa nostock aadi hote hai
 Lichen can be divided into two classes according to the part and appearance of the fungus
 ascolaikenez - isamen kavak bhaag ascomicitis varg kaa ekak hota he
 Bassidioalkenes - The fungal part of this is a unit of the class Basidiomycetes
 ascolikene ko usee falkaay kii banaavat par phir do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: palidhakaay, jisamen falkaay perithisium tathaa vivrutkaay,, jisamen falit bhaag vivrutkaay apothesium hota he
 The internal structure of most of the phenyl lichen is divided into the following four tissues: valkut, jo praaia: udagr kavach sutron se nirmit hoti he, jinke bich bich main, yaa to rikt sthaan nahin hote or yadi hote hai to ve shleshi saamagree se bhare hote hai
 The algae layer is just below the culvert
 isamen shaiwal kii hari koshikaaye uljhe hue kavak sutron main mili rahati hai
 This level is also called Kanistar

 Sub-vulva is made from dense fungal formulas and is the lowest layer
 ad: valkut ke nichle dharaatal se mulabhas nikle hote hai
 They work to connect the thallus to the base and carry mineral salts and water
 parptimay likene main ad: valkut nahin hota or kshupil likene ke thelas main adhikanshat: ek valkut baahar kii ore hota he, jiske neeche shaiwal str tathaa uske neeche ek madhyak aksh hota he
 The algae contained within the lichen are mostly integral to the algae growing outside
 inaki koshikaon main haraa rang nihit hota he, jisaki sahaayta se ye bhojan nirmaan karte hai, kintu jab tak shaiwal likene ke ang hai, tab tak ye prajannaang nahin banaate
 The growth rate in fungal cells is also reduced
 ye kavak swatantra jeevanyaapan ke ayogy ho jate hai
 Lichen are spread around the world

 They are found at higher than sea level in tropical regions, Dhruv regions, deserts and water places
 virale hi likene pani ke bheetar milte hai, jinamein hydrothyria venosa naamak shaiwal sabase vicitra he
 In colder climates, lichen become rockers, meaning they spend their lives on rocks, or rocks
 kintu bumadhyarekhik kshetron main ye valkarohi hi rahete hai, arthath vahaan inkaa aadhaar vriksh ke tane tathaa shakhaon kii chhaalen hoti hai
 Some lichen are in situ and some also occur at sea

 kintu ye bade shaharon ke paas kabhi nahin ug pate, kyonki nagaron ke aas paas ke kaarkaanon kaa dhunaa tathaa anya gas aadi inke liye ghaatak hai
 They depend exclusively on air hygiene

 Although light is necessary for lichen to grow, some species can grow even in places where there is complete darkness, such as Fisia obscura
 thelas kaa rang prakaash kii kirnon kii tivrata par nirbhar hota he
 The green color of algae cells is obscured by the fungal formulas when the lichen thallus dries
 ardra likene kaa rang haraa hota he, kyonki iske andar sthit tantuon dwaara prakaash kaa pareshan hota he, jisase shaiwal bhaag kaa haraa rang spasht ho jaataa he
 The color of many licenses is particularly attractive
 ye rang vibhinn carbonic amlon ke kaaran hote hai, jo laikenon kaa langalan karne main sahaayta to dete hai parantu saath hi khaane ke liye aruchikar banaate hai
 The presence of these algae cells was an enigma when the texture and structure of lichen was first discovered, as they were very different from the rest of the thallus
 likene ke kuch vidhyaarthiyon ne in hari vastuon ko likene padap kaa abhinn bhaag maanakar yah vichaar prakat kiya he ki inaki utpatti rang rahit kavak tantuon se hi hui he
 Some experts have considered them as part of reproduction and some have accepted them as organs for making food
 sarvapratham shwedenor ne yah pramaan upasthit kiya tha ki yah hari vanaspati shaiwal he jo kavak tantuon dwaara tehrai gai he or paraseete kii gai he
 This theory was tested for the synthesis of lichen by mixing the appropriate algae and fungi
 yadi likene ke donon ang alag alag kar die jaaen to shaiwal ang swatantra jeevanyaapan kar saktaa he, kintu anashrith hone par kavak ang jivit nahin rah saktaa
 When it was fully proved that the body of lichen is made up of two flora, which are algae and fungi respectively, the lichen's attention was drawn to the relation of these two parts for which scholars gave different names and descriptions
 is
 kuch log likene kii tulana ek sankaay se karte hai, jisamen ek shaiwal ek kavak se sambandhit hota he
 Both of these get mutual benefit from this type of relationship and this type of life is called Sahajiyanan
 isamen prayek bhaag kuch aise bhautik kaaryon kaa sampadan karata he, jinase duusare ko laabh ho sake
 The algae organ performs the entire task of preparing food with the presence of its green substances
 is kaary ke liye kavak purnataya asamarth hota he or shaiwal ang dwaara bana bhojya padaarth kavak ko bhi praapt hota he
 On the other hand the fungi of the fungus are responsible for the percolation, mineral salts and water flow and the fungi also protect the algae part from excess dryness, moisture, cold and heat
 kuch vanaspatigyon ke vichaaron ke anusaar yah paraspar laabh kaa sambandh hote hue bhi ek ke liye hanikaarak he
 According to some scholars, this is an example of parasitism, in which the algae part is infested by fungi
 likene kaa koi bhi pruthak hua bhaag uchit vaataavaran main svantraapurvak bad saktaa he
 Some lichen make a special type of organ for reproduction, called soridia
 ye thelas ke chote chote bhaag hote hai, jinamein ek yaa do shaiwal koshikaaye kavak tantuon dwaara aawarit hoti hai
 After breaking down from the ancestral bags, they make new plants by reaching the proper environment by air, rain or animals
 inke likene ke donon sanghatak shaiwal tathaa kavak kii santulit vruddhi hoti he
 Some lichens have growth growth like branches, which contain both algae and fungi
 ye udvardh aasaani se pruthak ho jate hai or uchit vaataavaran main nae paudhon ko janm dete hai
 Apart from the promotion of lichen, the constituent fungi and algae also secrete spontaneously
 bahut se laikenon main kavak niyamit rup se ascocarp tathaa dhaani banaate hai, jinka rup perithisium, apothesium, yaa anya prakaar kaa hota he

 In the analog state, the spores germinate, giving rise to a formula and if this formula comes close to any algae cells to which it was related to lichen, a new lichen sac is synthesized

 For this reason, it is doubtful whether granules play an important function in the promotion of lichen

 Orsin is obtained by purifying the color obtained from these licenses and is used in the coloring of microscopic constructions
 litum rang bhi likene se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Some lichens contain tannin, which is used to cook raw skins of animals

 Tyagaraja was a devotional poet and a great musician of Carnatic music
 unhone samaaj evam sahitya ke saath-saath kala ko bhi samrudh kiya
 He was rich in versatility
 unhone sainkadon bhakthi geeton kii rachana kii jo bhagwaan ram kii stuti main the or unke sarvshereshth geet panchratra kriti aksar dharmik aayojanon main gaae jate hai
 Born on May 4, 1767 at Tiruvarur in Thanjavur district, Tyagaraja's mother's name was Sitamma and father's Rambrahmam
 vah apni ek kriti main kehete hai - "sitamma mayamma shri ramudu maa tandri" 
 Perhaps he wants to say two things through his song
 ek ore vaastavik mata-pita ke bare me bataate hai duusari ore prabhu ram ke prati apni aasthaa pradarshit karte hai
 Born and raised in a well-cultured family, Tyagraj was a scholar and poet
 vah sanskrit jyotish tathaa apni maatrubhaasha telegu ke gyaata the
 For Thyagaraja, music was the way to interview God and his music showed a particularly revealing sense of devotion
 sangeet ke prati unka lagaav bachapan se hi tha
 At an early age he became a disciple of Venkataramanaiya and in his teens he composed the first song 'namo Namo Raghav'
 dakshin bhartiya shastreey sangeet ke vikaas main prabhavi yogadan karne vaale tyagaraj kii rachanaaen aaj bhi kaaphi lokapriy hai or dharmik aayojanon tathaa tyagaraj ke sammaan main yojit kaaryakramon main unka khub gayan hota he
 Tyagaraja, along with Muttuswamy Dixit and Shyamasastri, gave a new direction to Carnatic music and, given his contribution, he was named as Trimurti
 unki sangeet pratibha se thanjavur naresh kaaphi prabhavit the or unhen darbar main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit bhi kiya tha
 But Tyagaraja, immersed in the worship of the Lord, declined his attractive offer
 unhone raja ke prastaav ko asweekaar kar prasiddh kriti 'nidhi chal sukham yani kya dhan se sukh kii prapti ho sakati he' kii rachana kii thi
 It is said that Tyagaraja's brother threw that idol of Lord Rama in the nearby Kaveri river, which he used to offer
 tyagaraj apane isht se algaav ko bardaasht nahin kar sake or ghar se nikal pade
 In this sequence, he visited almost all the major temples of South India and composed songs in praise of the gods of those temples
 tyagaraj ne kareeb 600 kritiyon kii rachana karne ke alaava telegu main do naatak prahlaad bhakthi vijay or nauka charitam bhi likhaa
 While Prahlad Bhakti Vijay is a drama of 45 works in five scenes, the boat is Charitam Ekanki and has 21 works
 tyagaraj kii vidwata unki har kriti main jhalkati he haalanki panchratra kriti ko unki sarvshereshth rachana kaha jaataa he
 Apart from hundreds of songs, he composed compositions of the festival sect Kirtanam and Divya Nama Kirtanam
 unhone sanskrit main bhi geeton kii rachana kii haalanki unke adhiktar geet telegu main hai
 It is said about the compositions of Tyagaraja that everything in them is in its best form
 usamen koi bhi hissaa anaavashyak nahin he chaahe sangeet ho yaa bol
 Apart from this, there is also a flow in it that draws the music lovers towards themselves
 aadhyatmik rup se vah un logon main the jinhone bhakthi ke saamne kisi baat kii parvaah nahin kii
 He loved only music and devotion and both of them were synonymous for him
 unke jivan kaa koi bhi pal ram se juda nahin tha
 In his works, he describes Lord Rama as a friend, owner, father, assistant
 apni bhakthi ke bich hi unhone chah janvari 1847 ko samadhi le lee
 The meaning of saints literature in this article is that literature which is composed by devotees
 yah aavashyak nahin ki sant use hi kaha jaae jo nirgun brahm kaa upaask ho
 Under this, all the sattpurushis of Lokmangalvadhyayi come, but modern writers have given the title of "saint" to the devotees of Nirguniyya and now the word has started in the same category
 "sant" shabd sanskrit "sat" ke prathama kaa bahuvachananth rup he, jiskaa arth hota he sajjan or dharmik vyakti
 The word for sage men in Hindi came into practice
 kabir, surdaas, goswami tulsidas aadi puraane kaviyon ne is shabd kaa vyavhaar sadhu or paropkaaree, purush ke arth main bahulansh: kiya he or uske lakshan bhi die hai
 It is not necessary for a philanthropist saint to be a scholar and linguist
 uskaa lokahitkar kaary hi uske santatv kaa maandand hota he
 In Hindi litterateurs, who were "nirguniye saints", most of the illiterate Kinnas were under-educated
 shastreey gyaan kaa aadhaar na hone ke kaaran aise log apane anubhav kii hi baaten kehane ko baadhya the
 Therefore, in their limited experience there may be many such things, which will be contrary to the scriptures
 alpashikshit hone ke kaaran in santon ne vishay ko hi mahatv diya he, bhashaa ko nahin
 Their language is often rough and panchrangi
 kavy main bhaavon kii pradhanta ko yadi mahatv diya jaae to sachhee or khari anubhutiyon kii sahaj evam saadharanokrut abhivyakti ke kaaran in santon main kaiyon kii bahuveri rachanaayen uttam koti ke kavy main sthaan paane kii adhikarini maani ja sakati he
 They do not blindly support every charity donated by tradition
 inke chintan kaa aakaar sarvamanavvaad he
 These humans do not believe in any kind of difference between humans
 inkaa kahana he ki koi bhi vyakti apane kulvishesh ke kaaran kisi prakaar vaishishty liye hue utpann nahin hota
 In their eyes, the specialty should be taken with two things: obedient benevolence or public service and godliness
 is prakaar swatantra chintan ke kshetra main in santon ne ek prakaar kii vaicharik kranti ko janm diya
 From the point of view of human welfare, the kind of religious thoughts and feelings published by the Nirguniyya saints, ideas and experiences had started getting place in old Hindi from long ago
 vikram kii naveen shatabdi main buddha sidhon ne jo rachanaayen prastut kin unamem vajrayan tathaa sahajayan sambandhi sampradayik vichaaron evam saadhnaaon ke upanysan ke saath-saath anya sampradaay ke vichaaron kaa pratyaakhyaan baraabar miltaa he
 The same sentiment seems to work in the statements of Nathpanthi yogis and Jain sages who are found in it
 baudhon main paramatma yaa ishwar ko sthaan praapt na tha, nathpanthiyon ne apane vachanon main ishwartv kii pratishtha kii
 Policy has a prominent place in all these compositions
 ye jagah-jagah lok ko upadesh dete hue dikhaai padate hai
 When Hindi developed after Old Hindi, then the influence of earlier literature inevitably had an impact on it
 isiilie hindi ke adikaal main dohon main jo rachanaayen milti hai unamem se adhikansh upadeshparak evam nitiparak hai
 There are also some in those couplets in which the soul of poetry is seen as glaring
 kintu itane se hi use kavy nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The emergence of saint tradition must be considered since the late fifteenth century Vikrami
 in santon kii baniyon main vichaarswatantry kaa swar pramukh rahaa vaishnav dharm ke pradhan acharya ramanuj, ninvark tathaa madhv vikram kii barahavin evam terahavin shatee main hue
 Through them, a ferocious stream of devotion emerged
 in aacharyon ne prasthaantrayee par jo bhashya prastut kiye, bhakthi ke vikaas main unka pramukh yoga he
 Some hindrance to the path of devotion was definitely present due to the promotion of the miracle-oriented yoga route from Gorakhnath, to which Goswami Tulsidas has also indicated: tathaapi vah uttarottar viksit hoti gai
 The same resulted in the birth of Sant Jayadeva in Utkal, the famous saint of the Varkari sect in Maharashtra [[namdev and Gyanadeva, saint Sadhana and Beni in the west and Sant Laldev in Kashmir
 in santon ke baad prasiddh sant ramanand kaa pradurbhaav hua, jinaki shikshaaon kaa jansamaj par vyapak prabhaav padaa
 It is a historically true that when the flow of a developed ideology is blocked and supported by another ideology, then along with the rational refutation of its principles, some popular and popular features of its ideology are also made subjective
 jagadguru shankar, raghavanand, ramanuj, ramanand aadi sabaki drushti yahi rahi he
 Nathpanth had an influence on the community, he had become a liberal
 vyapak lokdarshan ke falswaroop swami ramanand kii drushti or bhi udaar ho gai thi
 That is why the inclusion of Julahe, Raidas, Nai, Dom, etc
 is seen in his direct or indirect disciples
 is kaal main jo satyabhiniveshi bhakt yaa sadhu hue unhone sat ke grahapurvak asat par nirgam prahaar bhi kiye
 Due to the lack of realization of the emblem-oriented method of religion of ancient times, the satirical eloquence of saints like Kabir appeared attractive
 in santon main bahuton ne apane satkartavya kii itishree apane naam se ek nayaa "panth" nikaalane main samajhi
 Their collective humanist vision was plagued by parochialism
 is prakaar solahavin shatabdi se unnisvin shatabdi tak naanaa panth ek ke baad ek astitv main aate gaye
 The Sikh era Adi Nanakdev gave birth to Nanakpanth, Dadu Dayal Dadupanth, Kabirdas gave Kabirpanth, Bawri Bawarist, Haridas gave rise to Niranjani sect and Malukdas gave birth to Malukpant
 aage chalakar babalalji sampradaay, dhaani sampradaay, saath sampradaay, dharanishwari sampradaay, dariyaadasi sampradaay, dariyapanth, shivnarayani sampradaay, garibpanth, ramasanehi sampradaay aadi naanaa prakaar ke panthon evam sampradaayon ke nirmaan kaa shrey un santon ko he jinhone satyadarshan evam lokopkaar kaa vrath le rakhaa tha or baad main sankeernata ko gale lagaaya
 The saints who preached the worship of Nirguna Brahman were adamant to see Rama, Krishna etc
 as ordinary human beings, they themselves started worshiping themselves like Rama and Krishna
 sampradyposhakon ne apane aadi guru ko ishwar yaa paramatma siddh karne ke liye naanaa prakaar kii kalpit aakhyayikaaye garh daaleen
 This is the reason that the circles of all those Nirguniyya saints remained closed in the box of their creed or sect
 idhar sahitya main jab se shodhakarya ne bal paaya he tab se sahityagranthon ke katipay prishthon main unki charchaa ho jaati he, jansamanya se unka koi sampark nahin rah gaya he
 Two sects were also seen in these sects, who in their life gave priority to devotion but to karma
 sattnami sampradaywaalon ne mughal samrat aurangzeb ke viruddh vidroh kaa jhanda upar laharaaya tha 
 The ninth Guru of Nanakpanth, Shri Govind Singh, ended his sect as an army
 isi santaparampara main aage chalakar radhaswami sampradaay astitv main aayaa
 This saint tradition has lasted till Rammohan Roy, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Ramatirtha
 mahatma gandhi ko is parampara kii antim kadi kaha ja saktaa he
 As has been said earlier, the majority of these sects and creeds were uneducated
 at: ve maukhik rup main apane vichaaron or bhaavon ko prakat kiya karte the
 The disciple used to remember him
 aage chalakar unheen upadeshaatmak kathanon ko shishyon dwaara lipibaddh kar liya gaya or vahi unka dharmagranth ho gaya
 Somewhere in the collection of these statements and words, the idea of good and common poetry is also found
 at: in padyakaar santon main katipay aise sant bhi hai jo mukhyat: sant hote hue bhi gaunat: kavi bhi isamen kaiyon ne apni shastreey shiksha ke abhaav ko bahushrutata dwaara dur karne kaa prayaas avashya kiya he, yah bhi darshan ke kshetra main, sahitya ke kshetra main nahin
 Many of them did not even get to know the nature of literature, but the intensity of their experience attracts the mind of any emotional person
 aise santon main kabir kaa sthaan pramukh he
 Without considering the religious traditions and orthodox beliefs of both Hindus and Muslims, with foresight, the sarcastic attack they made and proclaimed themselves to be monastic and truthful to all sages, the lower class of society could not remain unaffected and modern foreign civilization Dixit and some people who are proud of Indian civilization and culture, in it true humanity Security had to hear the message
 rabindranath thakur ne brahmasamaji vichaaron se mail khaane ke kaaran kabir kii baniyon kaa angreji anuwaad prastut kiya or usase aaajeevan prabhavit bhi rahe
 Kabir is composed mainly in sakhis and curtains
 inamen unki swanubhootiyaan teevr rup main saamaane ai hai
 The first saint of Hindi in saint tradition is Jayadeva
 ye gitgovindkar jayadev se bhinn hai
 Sadhana, Trilochan, Namdev, Sen Bhai, Raidas, Pippa, Dhanna, Nanakdev, Amardas, Dharmadas, Dadudayal, Bashna ji, Bawri Sahiba, Garibdas, Sundardas, Dariyadas, Dariya Saheb, Sahajo Bai etc
 are the major saints of this tradition
