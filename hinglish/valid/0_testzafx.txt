 Feroz Shah Tughlaq ruled for 37 years
 usne apane rajya main khaadya padaarth kii aapurti ke liye va akalon ko rokane ke liye yamuna nadi se ek sinchai hetu nahar banavaai
 As an educated sultan, he wrote a memoir of his own
 is sansmaran main usne likhaa ki usne apane purvavartiyon ke ulat, apane raaj main yatnaa dena band kar diya he
 Torture such as amputation, taking out the eyes, ripping a person's body, breaking the spinal cord, pouring molten lead into the throat, burning a person, etc
 is sunni sultan yah bhi likhaa he ki vah sunni samudaay kaa dharmantaran ko sahan nahin karata tha, na hi use vah prayaas sahan the jisame hindu apane dhwast mandiron ko punah banaaye
 He wrote that as punishment, he sentenced many Shia, Mahdi and Hindus to death
 apane sansmaran main, usne apni uplabdhi ke rup main likhaa he ki usne bahut se hinduon ko sunni islam dharm main dikshit kiya or unhen jajia kar va anya karon se mukti pradaan kii, jinhone islam sweekaar kiya unka usne bhavy swaagat kiya
 At the same time, he increased the taxes and jizya at all three levels and stayed the decision of his predecessors who had liberated the Hindu Brahmins from jizya tax
 usne vyapak str par apane amiron va gulaamon kii bhartee kii
 Feroz Shah's rule was seen as a reduction in torture and an end to partisanship with certain sections of society, but also increased intolerance and oppression towards certain sections of society
 firoz shah ke mrityu ne araajaktaa or vighatan ko janm diya
 This kingdom had two last rulers, both declared their sultans and ruled from 1394–1397
 jiname se ek mahmud tughlaq tha jo ki firoz shah tughlaq kaa bada putr tha, usne dilli se shashan kiya
 The second was Nusrat Shah, a relative of Feroz Shah Tughlaq, who ruled Firozabad
 donon sambandhiyon ke bich yuddh tab tak chalata rahaa jab tak taimur langs kaa 1398 main bharat par akraman nahin hua
 Timur, also known as Timburlen in Western literature, was an Ottoman emperor of Samarkand
 use dilli main sultaanon ke bich chal rahi jang ke bare main jaankaree thi
 So he traveled to Delhi in a planned way
 uske kooch ke dauraan 1 lakh se 2 lakh ke bich hindu maare gaye
 Timur did not aim to rule India
 usne dilli ko jamkar lutaa or puure shahar ko main aag ke hawaale kar diya
 For five days, his army committed horrific massacres
 is dauraan usne baari maatra main sampati, gulam va auraton ko ekatrit kiya or samarkand waapas laut gaya
 Anarchy and epidemic spread throughout the Delhi Sultanate
 sultan mahmud tughlaq taimur ke akraman ke samay gujarat bhaag gaya
 He returned again after the invasion, becoming the last ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty and remained a puppet in the hands of several factions
 shashan kaal 1414 se 1451 tak The Syed dynasty was an Ottoman dynasty that ruled the Delhi Sultanate from 1415 to 1451
 tamurud par akraman or luutane dilli sultanate ko badmaashon main chhod diya tha, or saiyad vansh ke shashan ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree he
 Ennimari Shimmel notes the first ruler of the dynasty as Khazar Khan, who assumed power by claiming to represent Timur
 People near Delhi also questioned his authority
 He was succeeded by Mubarak Khan, who himself Named as Mubarak Shah and tried to recapture the lost states of Punjab, unsuccessfully
 said vansh kii shakti ke saath, bhartiya upmahadweep par islam ke itihaas main gaharaa parivartan hua, shamimal ke anusaar
 The first major Sunni sect of Islam was thin, alternative Muslim sects such as the Shia rose, and new competition centers of Islamic culture took roots beyond Delhi
 saiyad vansh ko 1451 main lodi rajvansh dwaara visthapit kiya gaya tha
 From 1451 to 1526 lodi vansh afgaan lodi janajati kaa tha
 Bahlul Khan Lodi started the Lodi dynasty and was the first Pashtun to rule the Delhi Sultanate
 bahulal lodi ne apana shashan shuru kiya ki dilli sultanate ke prabhaav kaa vistaar karne ke liye muslim jonpur sultanate par hamalaa karke, or ek sandhi ke dwaara aanshik rup se safal hue
 Subsequently, the region from Delhi to Varanasi was back under the influence of the Delhi Sultanate
 bahalul lodi kii mrityu ke baad, unke bete nizaam khan ne satta sanbhali, khud ko sikandar lodi ke rup main punah namit kiya or 14 9 8 se 1517 tak shashan kiya
 One of the better known rulers of the dynasty, Sikandar Lodi expelled his brother Barbak Shah from Jaunpur, installed his son Jalal Khan as the ruler, then went on to claim Bihar in the east
 bihar ke muslim governors ne shradhanjali or karon kaa bhugtan karne par sahmati vyakt kii, lekin dilli sultanate se swatantra sanchalit
 Sikandar Lodhi campaigned to destroy the temples, especially around Mathura
 unhone apni rajdhani or adaalat ko dilli se agra tak le jaaya, ek pracheen hindu shahar jise lupt or dilli sultanate kaal kii shuruyaat ke dauraan hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 Thus Alexander established buildings with indo-islamic architecture in Agra during his rule, and after the end of the Delhi Sultanate, the development of Agra continued during the Mughal Empire
 sikandar lodi kii mrityu 1517 main ek prakritik maut hui, or unke duusare putr ibrahim lodi ne satta grahan kii
 Ibrahim did not have the support of Afghan and Persian eminent or regional chiefs
 ibrahim ne apane bade bhai jalaal khan par hamalaa kiya or unki hatya kar di, jinhen unke pita ne jonpur ke governor ke rup main sthapit kiya tha or amiron or pramukhon kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Ibrahim Lodi was unable to consolidate his power, and after Jalal Khan's death, the governor of Punjab, Daulat Khan Lodi, reached Mughal Babur and invited him to attack the Delhi Sultanate
 1526 main babar ne panipat kii ladaai main ibrahim lodi ko haraaya or maar daalaa
 Ibrahim Lodi's death ended the Delhi Sultanate and was replaced by the Mughal Empire

 Mr
 Gopal Krishna Gokhale, the leader of the Liberals, went to England to meet him to present his views to the "minister of India" Lord John Morley
 shri gokhale ne morle ko yah bharosa dilaayaa kii bharat main sanvaidhanik sudhaaron kii taatkaalik aavashyaktaa he
 Lord Morley agreed with the views of Mr
 Gokhale and Lord Minto, who was then Viceroy of India, was also in favor of bringing constitutional reforms
 The Indian Council Act, 1909, commonly known as the morley-minto Reforms, was introduced as an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to provide for limited participation of Indians in the rule of British India
 Was

 He was clear that it was necessary to satisfy the loyal elite class of India and the prosperous westernized class of society by taking a dramatic step
 is tarah unhone bhartiya parishad adhinium, 1909 ko prastut kiya 
 bhartiya rashtri congress ki mukhya maang thi "swashaasi british coloniyon kii bhaanti sarkaar kii vyavastha" lekin is maang ko maanane ki is adhinium main koi ichha nahin dikhaai gayi
 The Act was important for the following reasons: bekal utsaahi kaa vaastavik naam shafi khan lodi tha

 Baba Kinaram was a famous saint of the North Indian saint tradition, whose fame spread throughout India in later times
 varanasi ke paas chandauli jile ke gram ramgarh main ek kuleen raghuvanshi kshatriya parivaar main san 1601 i
 main inkaa janm hua tha
 From childhood, spiritual rites were very strong in them
 tatkaaleen reeti ke anusaar baarah varshon ke alp aayu main, inaki ghor anichhaa rahete hue bhi, vivaah kar diya gaya kintu do teen varshon baad dwiragaman kii purv sandhya ko inhone hathpurvak maan se mangekar doodh-bhaat khaaya
 It is important to note that in Sanatan Dharma, milk and rice is a ritual after the deceased's rites
 baba ke doodh-bhaat khaane ke agle din sabere hi vadhoo ke dehanth kaa samachar aa gaya
 Everyone wondered how they foresaw the death of their wife
 aghor panth ke jwalanth sant ke bare main ack kathanak prasiddh he,ki ack baar kaashi naresh apane hathi par savaar hokar shivala sthit ashram se ja rahe the,unhonen baba kinaaraam ke taraf talkhi najaron se dekha,tatkaal baba kinaaraam ne aadesh diya divaal chal aage,itnaa kahana ki divaal chal diya or kaashi naresh kii hathi ke aage - aage chalane laga
 Then the King of Kashi realized his pride and immediately fell at Baba Kinaram's feet
 yah virakt to rahete hi the, ghar se bhi nikal pade or ghoomte-phirte gajipur jile ke kaaron gram ke paas kameshwar dham main ramanuji sampradaay ke sant shivaraam kii seva main pahunche
 After some time, before giving initiation, Mahatma Ji asked him to walk on the Ganges with the goods of bath meditation for examination
 yah shivaraam ji kii poojanadi kii saamagree lekar gangatat se kuch dur pahunch kar ruk gaye tathaa gangaji ko jhukkar pranaam karne lage
 When he raised his head, he saw that the water of Bhagirathi has reached its feet
 inhone is ghatana ko guru kii mahima maani
 Shivram Ji was watching all this from a distance
 unhone kishor kinaaraam ko asaamaanya siddh mana tathaa mantra diksha di
 According to public opinion, Baba Kinaram used to walk by car in the Kameshwar Dham on foot at midnight every day to reach the Kaiharani Bhawani temple in Karimuddinpur and reach the car before dawn
 baba kinaaraam ko mata kshtaharni ne apane haathon se prasad dekar siddhi pradaan kii thi
 After Shivaram ji remarried after his wife's death, Kinaram ji left him
 ghoomte-ghamate naidih gaanv pahunche
 There was an old woman crying a lot
 poochne par usne bataaya ki uske ekmaatr putr ko bakaayaa lagaan ke badale jameendaar ke sipaahi pakad le gaye hai
 Kinaram ji with old age went to the zamindar's door and saw that the boy was sitting in the sun
 jameendaar se use mukt karne kaa aagrah vyarth gaya tab kinaaraam ne jameendaar se kaha-jahaan ladkaa baitha he vahaan kii dharti khudva le or jitna tera rupaya ho, vahaan se le le
 On digging two hands deep, everyone was stunned to see the balance lying there
 ladkaa to turant bandhanmukt kar hi diya gaya, jameendaar ne bahut bahut kshamaa maangi
 The old lady handed the boy to Kinaram Ji
 bijaram uskaa naam tha or sambhavat: kinaaraam ji ke sharir tyaag pashchaat varanasi ke unke math kii gaddi par vahi adhishthit hua
 At Girnar, the recognized site of the Aughdras, Kinaram ji had himself seen by Dattatreya, who is considered the second founder of Oughdapan after Rudra
 aisi manyata he ki param siddh aughadon ko bhagwaan dattatreya ke darshan girnaar par aaj bhi hote he vartmaan kaal main, kinaaraami aughadpanthi paramsidhon kii barahavin peedi main, varanasisth aghoreshwar bhagwaan ram ko bhi girnaar parvat par hi dattatreya ji kaa pratyaksh darshan hua tha
 After Girnar Kinaram ji reached Junagadh with Bijaram
 vahaan bhiksha maangane ke aparaadh main us samay ke nawab ke aadamiyon ne bijaram ko jail main band kar diya tathaa vahaan rakhi 981 chakkiyon main se, jinamein se adhiktar pehle se hi bandi sadhu sant chalaa rahe the, ek chakki inako bhi chalaane ko de diya
 Kinaram ji learned this from Siddhibal and started asking for alms in the city himself the next day
 vah bhi karagaar pahunchaae gaye or unhen bhi chalaane ke liye chakki di gai
 Baba asked to walk from the mill without putting his hand but it was his pastime, the mill did not work
 tab unhone paas hi padi ek lakdi uthaakar chakki par maari
 Surprised that all the 981 wheels started running on their own
 samachar paakar nawab ne bahut kshamaa maangi or baba ke aadeshaanusaar yah vachan diya ki us din se jo bhi sadhu mahatma junagarh aayenge unhen baba ke naam par dhai pav aataa roj diya jayega
 The Nawab's lineage tradition also continued with Baba's blessings
 uttarakhand himalay main bahut varshon tak kathor tapasya karne ke baad kinaaraam ji varanasi ke harishchandra ghat ke shmashaan par rahanevaale aughad baba kaluram ke paas pahunche
 Kaluram ji used to feed the scattered skulls of dead corpses with great love
 kinaaraam ko yah vyarth kaa khilwaad laga or unhone apni siddhi shakti se khopadiyon kaa chalanaa band kar diya
 Kaluram meditated and understood that this power is only in Kinaram
 inhen dekhakar kaluram ne kaha-bhukh lagi he
 Feed the fish kinaaraam ne ganga tat kii ore mukh kar kaha-gangiya, laa ek machhlee de ja
 a large fish came out of the water automatically
 thodi der baad kaluram ne ganga main bahe ja rahe ek shav ko kinaaraam ko dikhaaya
 Kinaram called the corpse from there, he started coming to the flowing shore and got up and stood up
 baba kinaaraam ne use ghar vaapis bhej diya par uski maan ne use baba kii charanseva ke liye hi chhod diya
 After all, it is said that Kaluram ji appeared in his form and took Kinaram along with him to Krekund where he told him to consider this place as Girnar
 samast tirthon kaa fal yahan mil jayega
 Since then Kinaram started living mainly in the same place
 apane pratham guru vaishnav shivaraam ji ke naap par unhone chaar math sthapit kiye tathaa duusare guru, aughad baba kaluram kii smriti main krinkund, ramgarh, deval tathaa hariharpur main chaar aughad gaddiyaan kaayam kin
 Apart from these major places, there are many pillows
 sahaj hi prashn uthta he ki aughad koun hai ? aughad shakti kaa sadhak hota he
 Chandi, Tara, Kali are all forms of strength, names
 yajurveda ke rudradhyay main rudra kii kalyankaari murti ko shivi kii sangya di gai he, shiva ko hi aghora kaha gaya he
 The Tantra texts related to Shiva and Shakti propose that in reality both are not separate but an integral element
 rudra aghora shakti se sanyukt hone ke kaaran hi shiv hai
 In short it is enough for us to know this much
 baba kinaaraam ne isi aghora shakti kii sadhana kii thi
 The miraculous divine accomplishments are achieved spontaneously as a result of such practice, nothing is impossible for such a seeker
 vah paramhans pad praapt hota he
 No one shows miracles for such a proven performance, it should be aimed at public welfare
 aughad sadhak kii bhed buddhi kaa naash ho jaataa he
 He does not abide by prevailing worldly beliefs
 sab kuch kaa avadhunan kar, upeksha kar upar uth janaa hi avadhoot pad praapt karnaa he

 kanoon main, grahanadhikaar yaa lian kisi sampatti ke evaj main die gaye rin shodhan yaa kisi anya daayitv ke nirvaah ke badale main bhugtan ko surakshit karne ke liye hit suraksha kii manjuuri kaa ek prakaar he
 The owner of the property, who grants the lien or lien, is called the liener and the person who gets the benefit of the lien
 anglo-french lian, loyen "bond", "ristrent", latin ligamen se, ligare se "tu bind" shabd vyutpatti kaa mul he
 In the United States, the term lien usually denotes a wide range of fee weights and includes other types of mortgages or fees
 sanyukt rajya america main, lian vilakshan rup se gaiyr-swaamitvkaari suraksha hiton yaa byaaj pratibhutiyon ke liye sanderbhit he 
 In other similar law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of interest securities; Under it, a passive right of retention on the property is obtained until it is free from debt or other liability
 anya deshon main vishuddh rup se pratibhuti byaaj kaa swatv sambandhi rup kehalaata he; iske vipareet USA main is shabd kaa upyog nishchit taur par us samay hota he, jab sampatti par dakhal nahin rahata or tab lian arthath grahanadhikaar nirmukt hota he
 However, in countries with similar laws, it is also identified as a slightly inconsistent type of securities interest, called an "equitable lien", which occurs in some rare cases
 shabdaawalee or iske amal main antaron ke baavjood, USA or saamaan kanoon vaale deshon ke vibhinn grahanadhikaron ke bich anek prakaar kii samanthaayen hai
 Lien may be consensual or non-consensual; Consensual lien is imposed by a contract between the lender and the debtor: asahmatijnya grahanadhikaar khaas taur par adhinium dwaara yaa saamaan kanoon kii kaarywahi se saamne aate hai
 Those laws give the lender the right to impose a lien on an item of real property or movable property by maintaining the relationship between the lender and the debtor
 un grahanadhikaron main shaamil hai Liens are also "flawless" or "defective"
 Flawless liens are those liens for which a lender establishes a priority right over the encumbered property, respecting third-party lenders
 saadharantaya tisare paksh ko lian kii notice bhejkar kanoon dwaara apekshit kadam uthaakar purnataa pramanit hoti he
 The fact is that if a part or part of the property is in the hands of the lender, then perfection is usually established
 jab sampatti rini ke hi haathon main rahati he, tab upyukt karyaalay main byaaj pratibhuti kii notice kii recording jaisi kuch karrwai kar lee jaani chahie
 The perfection of a lien is an important part of the job of securing the lender's interest in the property
 sampatti ke asli khariddaar ke liye doshahin lian vaid he, or yahaan tak ki diwalia hue nyaasi ke maamle main bhi, jabaki doshapurn lian nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 An equitable lien in the United States is a right that applies only to equity and that satisfies the demand for a particular or a particular asset without capturing the fund or property
 U
S
 kanoon main, aise grahanadhikaar chaar paristhitiyon main vishesh rup se saamne aate hai: Outside the USA, a common law lien is defined in general terms as a passive right to hold movable property conferred by law
 aadhunik paristhitiyon main lagu karne ke liye bagaiyr kisi vaastavik prayaas ke jab koi maamla aitihaasik taur par sthapit ho, tab aadhunik kanoon aamtaur par kanoonee grahanadhikaar ko chhod detaa he
 Tappenden v
 Artus 2 QB 185 Diplock LJ refers to the lien of a "self-service" remedy, such as "other earlier measures such as termination of nuisance, self-protection, or taking out trespassers from the ground"
 Equitable liens are an unusual type of property right, commonly considered sui generis
 vishesh grahanadhikaar or saamaanya grahanadhikaar main vibhajit hai ek samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar
 ek vishesh grahanadhikaar, jo bahut hi saamaanya prakaar kaa hota he, ko sampatti or pradaan kii jane vaali seva ke bich ek ghanishtha sambandh kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Only a special lien or lien can be exercised in connection with fees related to the instant transaction; Also, leni or debtor cannot use the property withheld as security of old debts
 a general lien affects all of the property of the debtor that is in the possession of the lender and guarantees the security of all debts owed by the lender to the debtor
 ek vishesh grahanadhikaar ko anubandh dwaara aam grahanadhikaar main vistaarit kiya ja saktaa he or yah aam taur par kariers ke maamle main kiya jaataa he
 a common law lien gives only a passive right of retention; The same law does not give the right to sell, although some statutes also provide additional rights to sell, and it is possible to confer a separate right through contract
 samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar ghanishtha rup se tathakthith "kaaman collings" ke saath sanrekhit hote hai, lekin ve aapas main sah-vistari nahin hote hai
 a common law lien is a very limited type of securities interest
 is sach ke baavjood ki yah kabje kaa sirf niskriy adhikaar detaa he, ek grahanadhikaar hastantarit nahin kiya ja saktaa he; kisi tisare paksh dwaara is par adhikaar nahin jataayaa ja saktaa, jiske kabje main maal he un sevaaon ke liye jise mul paksh dwaara kiya janaa chahie;; or agar chal-sampatti rindaata ko adhyarpit kar di jaati he to lian kii hakdaari hardam ke liye samaapt ho jaati he 
 koi rini jo avaidh rup se chal-sampatti ko bechata he, vah roopantaran kaa jimmedaar ho saktaa he, saath hi lian ke samarpan kaa bhi
 Equitable lien or equitable liens in countries with similar laws have increased unique and difficult issues
 ek nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar kanoon kii kaarywahi dwaara pradutt ek gaiyr-swaamitv vaala suraksha adhikaar he, jo prabhaav main ek samyik prabhaar ke samaan he
 It differs from any charge when it is non-consensual
 yah bahut hi simit paristhitiyon main pradutt hota he, inamen sabase aam he bhoomi kii bikri ke sambandh main; ek abhukt vikreta kaa kharid keemat ke liye bhoomi par ek nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar hota he, baavjood iske ki kreta kaa sampatti par kabja ho chukaa ho
 ise equitable niyam par ek pratibhaar ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jo kharidgi ke anubandhon ke vinimay ke baad khariddaar ko bhoomi par ek laabhakaari hit pradaan karata he
 It is a matter of speculation as to how much of the equitable lien can be extended outside the impregnated seller's lien
 kriyasheel chizon ke shaamil rahe anek maamalon main nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar ko roak rakhaa gaya he, lekin chal-sampatti ke sambandh main ab tak nahin
 australian adaalatein vyaktigat sampatti se sambandhit nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar ke maamalon main sabase adhik grahanshil hai 57 ALJR 211 dekhen), lekin ek nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar kis par lagaaya jaay isse sambandhit siddhanton kii spashtataa kii kami maamalon kii samiksha main dekhi gayi
 But overall, there is still a lack of central synergy
 haalanki charchaa kiye gaye grahanadhikaar ke rup main tark saadhy na bhi ho, lekin rin bhaar ke do anya roopon kaa bhi kabhi-kabhi grahanadhikaar ke rup main ullekh hota he
 Some statutes provide a passive right to retain property against its owner as a security for obligations
 udhaaharan ke liye, united kingdom ke civil aviation act 1982 kii dhara 88 hawaii adde ko abhukt hawaii adda shulk or vimaanan eendhan ke liye kisi vimaan ko rokane kii anumati pradaan karti he
 Although this right is treated as a lien under UK insolvency law, it is argued that such statutory rights are not actually liens, but these rights are in line with the lien; However some people may say that this is a distinction without any difference
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki ek samjhaute ke dwaara kiya gaya anubandh grahanadhikaar nahin he, jisamen ek paksh duusare paksh ke maal ko tab tak roke rakh saktaa he jab tak ki bhugtan nahin ho jaae, kyonki ek samaan kanoon ke tahat grahanadhikaar gaiyr-sahmatijnya grahanadhikaar nahin ho saktaa
 haalanki, aisa prathit hota he ki diwalia kanoon ke tahat, aise adhikaron ko grahanadhikaar kii tarah hi liya jaayegaa, bhale hi vah grahanadhikaar kii tarah nahin vyakt kiye jaaen
 Maritime lien is a lien that is awarded on a vessel to ensure the claim of a lender who provides maritime services on the vessel or is injured in using the vessel
 The maritime lien is also sometimes referred to as an informed sight mortgage
 samudri grahanadhikaar anya grahanadhikaron ke kanoonon ke tahat zyaadaatar adhikaar kshetron main ek jaise hai
 The maritime lien is known as "one of the peculiarities of very unique naval law"
 ek samudri grahanadhikaar jahaajon par is prakruti ke pratibhuti byaaj kaa nirmaan karata he jo ek samaan kanoon yaa equity ke liye agyaat he
 This arises purely from the proceeding of the law and exists as a claim on the property concerned, both secret and invisible, which is often preferred over other forms of interest protection registered by the statute
 haalanki ye visheshtaayen vibhinn deshon ke kanoonon ke tahat alag-alag hai, jinhen is tarah varnit kiya ja saktaa he: Around the world, there are a large number of different types of liens and many subdivisions of it
 nimnlikhit sabhi prakaar ke liens sabhi vaidhanik pranali main maujuud nahin hote hai jisase grahanadhikaar kii avadharana ko pahachaanaa jaae
 neeche jo vivaran die ja rahe hai jaruri nahin ki ve paraspar anany hon
 grahanadhikaar ke prakaaron main shaamil hai Data is a supplement to store space which is given space in the CPU or memory of computer or mobile
 jisame yah rakshit rahata he
 And data is used as a medium to speed up and suspend the start of a program
 data shabd kaa pehla upyog 1940 me angraji me kiya gaya tha
 The term "data" was first used in 1946 in "transmissible and Stable Computer Information"
 data shabd ke kai matlab he jaise soochna, gyaan yah shabd data se sambandit he lekin har shabd kaa apana alag hi mahatv he
 Data is not just computer related words, we can also call any information as data
 computer ke avishkaar na hon se pehle bhi log data ekatrit karte the jo kitabo me rakhaa jaataa tha aaj bhi rakhaa jaataa he
 Many devices were invented in the modern era, which led to the use of the term data

 Failure by an organism to recognize its own parts as its own is called autoimmunity or autoimmunity, resulting in an immune response to its own cells and tissues
 aisi padbhramit pratirakshi pratikriya ke kaadan hone vaale kisi bhi rog ko swapratirakshi rog kehete hai
 Autoimmunity is often caused by a lack of development of lifespan in the target body and thus the immune response acts against its own cells and tissues
 Notable examples include celiac disease, diabetes type 1), systemic lupus erythematosus), Jögren's syndrome, churg-strauss's pathology, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Grave's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and gouty arthritis)
 See, list of autoimmune diseases
 yah galatfahami nai nahin he ki vyakti kaa pratirakshak tantra apni swayan kii pratijanon ko pahchaanane main sampurna rup se aksham hota he
 In the early twentieth century Paul Ehrlich introduced the theory of horror autotoxicus, according to which the 'normal' body does not initiate an immune response against its own tissues
 is tarah kisi bhi swapratirakshi pratikriya ko asaamaanya mana jaataa tha or maanav rog se sambandhit samajha jaataa tha
 It is now accepted that autoimmune responses are an inexhaustible part of vertebrate immune systems, which are usually prevented by the action of immune tolerance to auto-antigens from causing disease
 swapratiraksha ko kabhi bhinn-pratirakshakta nahin samajhnaa chaiye
 While high levels of autoimmunity are unhealthy, low levels of this can actually be beneficial
 sarvapratham, kam-stareey swapratiraksha sidi8+ tii koshikaon dwaara navtpadit koshikaon kii pahchaan karne main sahaayta karti he or is tarah cancer kii ghatnaon ko kam karti he
 Second, autoimmunity may have a role in allowing a rapid immune response in early stages of infection, at which time the achievement of foreign antigens limits the response
 Stephanova and others, in their study, injected mice with a per-mhc class II antibody expressing a single type of MHC class II molecule to temporarily inhibit CD4 + t cell – MHC interaction
 a decrease in the antigen pigeon's response to the cytochrome c peptide was observed in naive CD4 + t cells derived from these mice at 36 hours after giving per-mhc, which was determined by ZAP-70 phosphorylation, proliferation, and production of interleukin-2
 is tarah steffanova or anya videshi pratijanon kii anupasthiti main sidi4+ tii koshikaon kii pratikriyaatmakataa banaae rakhata he
 This idea of self-defense is theoretically a game of fighting

 The pioneering work done by Noyle Rose and Witebski in New York and by Royat and Doniak at University College London provide clear evidence that at least the extent of antibody-producing b lymphocytes is associated with lack of immune tolerance, as well as vascular and thyroid poisoning , Which is the ability of a person to reject the 'self' in response to 'non-self'
 is tut-foot ke kaaran pratirakshi tantra dwaara swanirnaayakon ke viruddh ek prabhaavshaalee or vishisht pratirakshi pratikriya prarambh hoti he
 The exact origin of immune tolerance is not yet known, but several theories have been presented since the mid-twentieth century to describe its origin
 pratirakshivaigyanikon kaa dhyaan teen pariklpanaaon ne vyapak rup se khinchaa he: Apart from these, in-depth study of two other theories is going on: sahishnutaa ko, uparlikhit jaanch kii vidhiyon ke kendriya lasikabh avyavon yaa paridhik lasikabh avyavon main kaary karne yaa na karne ke aadhaar par ‘kendriya’ or ‘paridhik’ sahishnutaaon main vibhajit bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 It should be emphasized that these theories are not mutually exclusive, and there are increasingly indications that all these processes may actively participate in vertebrate immune tolerance
 svaichhik maanav swapratirakshakta main sahishnutaa kaa lop ho janaa ek ulajhanbhara vishesh gun he, jo lagbhag puri tarah se bi lasikakoshikaon dwaara utpann swapratipind pratikriyaaon tak hi simit hota he
 The omission of tolerance in t cells is extremely difficult to demonstrate and wherever evidence of abnormal t cell responses is available, it is generally not against antigens identified by autoantibodies
 is tarah, gathiyaroop vaat main aijiji epasi ke prati swapratipind paae jate hai, lekin usase sambandhit tii koshika pratikriya hoti prathit nahin hoti
 pranalik lupas main diene ke prati swapratipind hote hai, jo tii koshika pratikriya utpann nahin kar sakate or tii koshikaon kii pratikriyaaon kaa simit saboot newcleoprotein pratijanon ko doshi paata he
 In celiac disease, tissues are autoantibodies to transglutaminase, but the t cell response is to the foreign antigen, gliadin
 is asamanta ke kaaran yah vichaar aayaa he ki maanav swapratirakshi rog adhikansh maamalon main bi koshika sahishnutaa ke lop hone par aadhaarit he, jo videshi pratijanon ke viruddh saamaanya tii koshika pratikriyaaon kaa prayog vividh prakaar ke pathbhrasht tareekon se karte hai
 Some people have genetically hypersensitivity to autoimmune diseases
 yah atisamvedansheeltaa kai jeenon or anya jokham karkon se sambandh rakhti he
 Autoimmune diseases do not always develop in genetically sensitive people
 kai swapratirakshi rogon main jeenon ke teen mukhya set hone kaa andeh he
 These genes are related to: pehle do, jo pratijanon kii pahchaan main bhaag lete hai, sahaj rup se parivartansheel or punarsangyojan ke prati samvedansheel hote hai
 These changes provide the immune system with the ability to react to a wide variety of aggressors, but can also produce lymphocytes with the ability to self-react

 The sex of any person also has some role in the development of autoimmunity, according to which most autoimmune diseases are classified as sex-related diseases
 swapratirakshi rogon se grast 23
5 million se adhik amarikiyon kaa 75 pratishat striyaan hai, haalanki yah kam logon ko pataa he ki lakhon purush bhi in rogon se grast hai
 According to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, autoimmune diseases in men are more acute
 aise kuch swapratirakshi rogon, jinke purushon main hone kii striyon ke baraabar yaa adhik sambhaavna hoti he, main shaamil hai –achaltakaarak kasherukashoth, prakaar 1 madhumeh, vegener kii grenulometosis, kron kaa rog or apras
 The reasons for gender's role in autoimmunity are unclear
 striyon main saamanyatya pratirakshi tantron ke protsaahit hone par purushon kii apeksha adhik badi shothajanak pratikriyaayein utpann hoti prathit hoti hai
 Indications of sex steroids are indicated in many autoimmune diseases with fluctuations in hormone changes, such as during pregnancy, menstrual cycle, or using oral contraceptives
 The history of conception also seems to leave an ever greater risk of autoimmune disease
 yah suzav diya gaya he ki garbhavastha main maataaon or unke bacchon ke bich jaraa sa bhi koshikaon kaa vinimay swapratirakshakta utpann kar saktaa he
 This leads to gender balance in the direction of the female

 The skewed theory of X-inactivity presented by Princeton University's Jeff Stewart has recently been confirmed experimentally in scleroderma and autoimmune thyroiditis
 anya jatil eks-sambandhit jananik samvedansheeltaa prakriyaayein prastut kii gai hai or adhyayanadhin hai
 An interesting inverse relationship exists between infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases
 jin kshetron main anek sankramak rog sthanik hote hai, vahaan swapratirakshi rog kaaphi kam hote hai
 To some extent the reverse also seems to be true
 shubhratha pariklpana main in sambandhon ko rogaanuon dwaara pratirakshakta ko parivartit karne kii yudhnitiyon se joda gaya he
 Although the idea has been dubbed false and ineffective, some studies have found the activity of autoimmune diseases with parasitic infections to be low
 prakhyat prakriya ke anusaar paraseete apni raksha karne ke liye mejabaan kii pratirakshi pratikriya ko kam kar detaa he
 By this, the host suffering from autoimmune disease can be fortunate
 paraseete pratirakshi pratikriya ke parivartan ke vivaran abhi tak gyaat nahin hai, lekin inamen shothavirohi karkon kaa srav yaa mejabaan ke pratirakshi sanketan shaamil ho sakate hai
 a contradictory review has observed a powerful association of certain microorganisms with autoimmune diseases
 udhaaharan ke liye, clebsiyela nimoniye or kakssekivirus bi kaa shaktishaalee sambandh kramshah achaltakaarak kasherukashoth or madhumeh prakaar 1 ke saath paaya gaya he
 This is explained by the tendency of infectious bacteria to produce anti-antigens that have the ability to cause multicellular activation of B-lymphocytes and to produce large amounts of antibodies of different characteristics, some of which may be self-reactive
 Huh 
 kuch rasaynic kaarak or aushadhiyaan bhi swapratirakshi rogon, yaa swapratirakshi rogon ke samaan dikhne vaale rogon kii utpatti se sambandhit ho sakati hai
 The most notable of these is the drug-induced lupus erythematosus
 Generally, the patient's symptoms are reduced by stopping the aggressive drug
 dhumrapaan ab gathiyaroop sandhishoth kii ghatana or tivrata ke mukhya jokham kaarak ke rup main sthapit ho chukaa he
 This may be related to abnormal citrullination of proteins, as the effects of smoking have been associated with the presence of antibodies to citrullinated peptides
 swapratirakshi rogon ke rogajananvigyaan main, jananik samvedansheeltaa or paryaavarniya parivartan kii prishthbhumi main kai prakriyaaon ke kaary karne kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 Writing about each of these processes is beyond the scope of this article, but some important procedures are summarized here: visheshgy pratirakshaniamak koshika prakaaron, jaise niamak tii koshikaon, enketi koshikaon, gammadelta tii koshikaon kii swapratirakshi rog main bhoomikaayen adhyayanadhin hai
 Autoimmune diseases can be broadly divided into systemic and organ-specific or endemic autoimmune disorders based on the main clinically-pathogenic special properties of each disease
 parmparik "avyav vishisht" or "gaiyr-avyav vishisht" vargeekaran yojana kaa prayog karke, anek rogon ko swapratirakshi rog chhatrachhaaya ke adheen ekatrit kar diya gaya he
 However, in many chronic inflammatory human disorders, a clear correlation between b and t cell-driven immunogenicity is not found
 In the last decade, it has been well established that tissue "self-inflammation" does not necessarily depend on abnormal t and b cell responses
 isse is baat kaa prastaav haal main saamne aayaa he ki swapratirakshakta ke varna-pat ko pratirakshakta rog continuam ke saath dekha janaa chaiye, jisamen adarsh swapratirakshi rog ek sire par or aantarik pratirakshi tantra dwaara sanchalit rog duusare sire par hote hai
 In this scheme, the full spectrum of autoimmunity can be included
 is nai yojana kaa prayog karke kai aam maanav swapratirakshi rogon main kaaphi aantarik pratiraksha dwaara madhyasth kii gai pratiraksharogajanyata dekhi ja sakati he
 This new classification scheme can be used in understanding disease processes and developing treatments
 
 Diagnosis of autoimmune disorders depends on accurate history and physical examination of the patient, and a high indicator of suspicion against the background of certain abnormalities in routine laboratory tests
 kai pranalik vikaron main, vishisht swapratipindon ko pahchaanane vaale sirovaigyanik pareekshanon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Endemic disorders can best be diagnosed by immunofluorescence of biopsy specimens
 swapratipindon kaa prayog kai swapratirakshi rogon ke nidaan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The levels of autoantibodies are measured to determine the development of the disease
 swapratirakshi rog ke upachaar parmparik rup se pratirakshashamak, shothavirohi, yaa santvnaatmak rahe hai
 Non-immune therapies, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or hormone displacement in type 1 diabetes, treat the outcome of an autoaggressive reaction, so these are comforting treatments
 aahaar kaa parivartan celia rog kii tivrata ko simit karata he
 Steroid or NSAID treatment limits the inflammatory symptoms of many diseases
 iviaiji kaa prayog siaidipi or jibies ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Specific immunosuppressive therapies such as anti-tnf alpha, rituximab, a b cell depleting factor, IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab, and the anti-inflammatory inhibitor abetacept have been shown to be useful for the treatment of RA
 inamen se kuch pratirakshiupachaaron kaa sambandh dushprabhavon ke bade hue jokham ke saath ho saktaa he, jaise sankraman kii sambhaavna

 1877 ke baad se yah pratiyogita vimbledon ke landan upnagar main ol england club main yojit kii jaati rahi he
 It is one of four Grand Slam tennis tournaments and is the only competition, which is still played on the original surface of the game, grass, which gave lawn tennis its name
 yah pratiyogita june ke ant main or july ke prarambh main do saptahon se adhik samay ke liye kheli jaati he, jisamen mahilaon or purushon ke singles final kaa aayojan kramshah duusare shanivaar or ravivaar ko kiya jaataa he
 Every year, five major competitions and four junior competitions and four promotional competitions are held, hard court australian open or clay court french open calendar varsh main vimbledon kii purvavarti pratiyogitaayen hai
 This is followed by the Hard Court US Open
 purushon ke liye, grass court agon championshipss kaa aayojan landan main or grey webar open kaa aayojan haale, germany main kiya jaataa he, ye donon aayojan mahatvapurn protsaahak pratiyogitaaon ke rup main kaam karte hai
 For women, the Aegon Classic and 2 joint competitions are held in Birmingham, the UNICEF Open in s-hertogenbosch, The Netherlands
 in pratiyogitaaon ke saath-saath agon international eastborn vimbledon ke liye protsaahak aayojanon kaa kaam karata he
 a mandatory dress code for contestants is a part of Wimbledon's traditions, as well as the inclusion of strawberries and cream in food and royal patronage
 2009 main, vimbledon ke centre court ko aisi sameti ja sakane vaali chat se dhakaa gaya, jisase khel pratiyogita ke dauraan centre court main khele jane vaale maichon main varsha ke kaaran aane vaali baadha ko dur kiya ja sake or isse hone vaali deree se bachaa ja sake
 The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club, originally founded in 1868 as 'the All England Croquet Club'
 iskaa pehla maidan vorpal road, vimbledon par sthit nahin tha
 Major Walter Clopton Wingfield designed lawn tennis as a sport, originally called 'sphyrystike', about a year later in 1875 when it was added to the club's activities
 1877 ke vasant main, club kaa naam badal kar 'da ol england croquet and lon tennis club' kar diya gaya or isane apane naam parivartan kaa sanket pehali lon tennis pratiyogita ke aayojan ke dwaara diya
 a new code of rules for this event was governed by) prepared

 The only competition held in 1877 was the men's singles, won by Spencer Gore, an older Herovian racket player, from the 22K field
 iske final ko dekhne ke liye lagbhag 200 darshakon main se prayek ne 1 shilling kaa bhugtan kiya tha
 The lawn in the grounds was arranged in such a way that the main court was situated exactly in the middle and the rest courts were around it; Therefore when the club was moved to the present site of Church Road in 1922, the title 'central Court' was retained, although it was not an actual description of its position
 haalanki, 1980 main maidan ke uttari bhaag main chaar nae court banaaye gaye, ab centre court ko adhik sahi dhang se paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The opening of the new first number court in 1997 bolstered this statement
 wimbledon ko vyapak rup se vishwa main pramukh tennis toornament mana jaataa he
 The All England Lawn Tennis Club, which hosts these sports competitions, is giving priority to maintaining its leadership in the 21st century

 puure do sookt indra ke janm se hi sambandhit hai
 a cow named 'nishtigri' or 'shavasi' has been described as her mother
 uske pita ‘dyuh’ yaa ‘twashta’ hai
 At one place he is said to have originated from 'som'
 uske janm ke samay dyava-prithvi kaanp uthi thi
 The birth of Indra can be considered as a symbol of the cloud of electricity
 indra ke sage-sambandhiyon kaa sankshipt vivaran is prakaar he
 Agni and Pushan are his brothers
 isi prakaar indrani uski patni he
 Possibly the name 'indrani' is from the traditional form of the feminine name of the man, the original name could be something else
 marudgan uske mitra tathaa sahaayak hai
 He is also conceived in conjunction with Varuna, Vayu, Soma, Jupiter, Pushan and Vishnu
 He is the image of the Sun in the three four suktas

 vah vikat rup se somras kaa paan karata he
 That gives him a boost
 vrutra ke saath yudhke avasar par puure teen sarovaron ko usne pikar som-rahit kar diya tha
 In the 119th Sukta of the tenth circle, Indra can be seen by eloquently describing his heroic deeds and power in the form of a welcome speech made by drinking soma
 som ke prati vishesh aagrah ke kaaran hi use som kaa abhishav karne vaale athwa use pakaane vaale yajmaan kaa rakshak batalaaya gaya he
 The famous ordnance of Indra is 'vajra', which can be considered integral with the electric strike

 The chariot carved by the two green varna horsemen was constructed by the dev-shilpi Ribhus
 indrakrut vrutra-vadh rugveda main bahudhaa or bahushah varnit or ullikhit he

 ukt daityon kaa awaas-sthal ‘parvat’ meghon ke atirikt kuch nahin he, jinka bhedan vah jal-vimochan hetu karata he
 Similarly, stone rocks that block cows are also water-proof clouds
 megh hi ve prasaad bhi hai jinamein purvokt daitya nivas karte hai
 The number of these prasadas has been stated somewhere 90, somewhere 99 and some 100, which, after demolition, Indra holds the 'purbhid'
 vrutra yaa ahi ke vadhapurvak jal-vimochan ke saath-saath prakaash ke anavaruddh bana diye jane kii baat bhi bahudhaa varnit he
 By killing that vritra or ahi, Indra makes the Sun visible to everyone
 yahan par ukt vrutra yaa ahi se abhipraay yaa to surya prakaash ke avarohak megh se he, yaa phir nishakalik andhkaar se
 The cows which are mentioned along with the Sun and the Ushas are the replicas of the rays of the early morning sun, which come out of their Krishna abode
 is prakaar indra kaa gopapatitv bhi suprakat ho jaataa he
 Apart from the slaughter of Vritra and Ahi, many other anecdotes are also available in relation to Indra
 ‘sarama’ kii sahaayta se usne ‘pani’ naamak daityon dwaara bandi banaai gai gaayon ko chin liya tha
 The demolition of 'ushas' chariot, the theft of a circle of the chariot of the Sun, mon-vijay etc
 anecdotes are also available
 indra ne compymaan bhootal or chalyman parvaton ko sthir banaaya he
 Like leather, he has spread the earth's earth
 jis prakaar ek dhuree se donon pahiye nikaal diye jaayan, usee prakaar usne dhuloak or prithvi ko pruthak kar diya he
 Indra is very aggressive
 swarg kii shaanti ko bhang karne vaala vahi ekmaatr devtaa he
 He fought with many gods
 ushas ke rath ko usne bhang kiya, surya ke rath kaa ek chakra usne churaayaa, apane anuyaayi maruton ko usne maar daalane kii dhamkee di
 He killed his father 'twashtha'
 anek daityon ko bhi usne parajeet or vinasht kiya, jisamen se vrutra, ahi, shambar, rohin ke atirikt uran vishwaroop, arbud, bal, vyansh or namuchi pramukh hai
 He also defeated hostile slaves or dasyus of Aryans in wars
 kam se kam 5 xxrep 4 0 anaryon kaa vinaash uske dwaara kiya gaya
 Indra has always been a protector, assistant and friend of his worshipers
 vah dasyuon ko bandi bana kar unki bhoomi aadi apane bhakton main vibhakt kar detaa he
 He makes the provider of the sacrifice with wealth
 uski is daansheeltaa ke kaaran hi uski oopaadhi ‘maghavan’ kii sarthakata he
 Indra's association with many historical men is also mentioned
 uski hi sahaayta se divodas ne apane das-shatru tathaa kulitar ke putr ‘shambar’ ko parajeet kiya
 Both 'turvash' and 'yadu' transported Indra across the rivers
 das nripatiyon ke viruddh yuddh main raja sudas kii usne sahaayta kii
 Thus Indra is the supreme deity of the Rigveda, whom Maxmular is the covenant of the sun, the god of Roth clouds and lightning, Benfe the symbol of the rainy sky, Grossman the symbol of the bright sky, the symbol of Hapkins lightning and Macdonal and Keith etc
 from the western to Acharya Baldev Upadhyaya
 Indian scholars consider the god of rain
 indra vrihadaakaar he
 Gods and humans do not reach the limits of his power
 vah sundar mukh vaala he
 His armament is Vajra or Sharu
 uski bhujaayen bhi vajravat pusht evam kathor hai
 He is the seventh numbered ancestral and is the ultimate record
 ‘nrimanasya mahna sa janaas indrah’ kah kar swayan gritsamad rishi ne uske balavikram kaa udghosh kar diya he
 The mountains tremble with him
 dyava-pruthivi arthath vahaan ke log bhi indra ke bal se bhay-bhit rahete hai
 He accomplishes his goal by conquering the wealth of enemies, in the same way that a hunter with the help of Kukkurs, slaughter a mrigadik, accomplishes his goal or the conquered gambler in the same way as the conquered stake money
 It becomes autonomous by incorporating itnaa hi nahin vah shatruon kii poshak samruddhi ko nasht-vinasht bhi kar daalata he
 He is a formidable warrior and performs violence similar to Vrkha in battle
 sabase badi baat to yah he ki vah ‘manaswan’ he
 Indra is the protector, assistant and friend of his devotees
 kaha bhi he ki--‘yo brahmano nadhamanasy kireh xxrep 13 
 avita’
 Vijayalabha is impossible without his help
 is liye yoddha-gana vijay ke liye or apni raksha ke liye uskaa aavahan karte hai
 This thing becomes even more clear with the following mantra: - Ya ya krantasi santhi vihwete parevar bhayaaya amitra
 samaann chidrathmasthivansaa naanaa havete sa janaas indrah
 
 ’ Indra helps the Aryans in the war against the non-aryans and makes them victorious
 etdarth vah vastuon kaa hanan evam apane apujakon va virodhiyon kaa vadh karata he
 He who delighted in him, enriched and unhappy on him, makes him a cult
 uske tattad gunon ke prabhaav se ashv, go, gram evam rathadi uske vash main rahete hai
 Thus he is representative of Nikhil world
 devtaa tak uski krupa ke paatr hai
 Indra has given stability to the unstable Earth
 idhar-udhar udate-phirte parvaton ke pankh-chhedan kar indra ne hi unhen tattat sthaan par prasthaapit kiya he
 He also shocked the world and thus created space
 do meghon ke madhya main vaidyut agni athwa do prastar-khandon ke madhya main saamaanya agni kaa janak indra hi he
 Indra has also been called the originator of Sun and Wind Usha
 vah antariksh-gat athwa bhootalvarti jalon kaa prerak he
 That is why he is considered the god of rain
 prithvi ko hi nahin pratyut sampoorn lokon ko sthir karne vaala athwa unhen rachane vaala bhi indra se bhinn koi or nahin he
 By this, even if the meaning of 'he made all things moving', Indra's glory does not decrease
 indra ne bhayavshaat parvaton main chhipe hue ‘shambar’ naam ke daitya ko 40 wein varsh dhund nikaala or uskaa vadh kar diya
 He also killed a demon named 'ahi' who performed forcefully
 ukt ‘ahi’ ko maar kar indra ne samarpanshil jalon ko athwa ganga aadi saat nadiyon ko pravaahit kiya
 Rahasin Asura ascending into heaven without killing Indra with his thunderbolt
 bal naamak daitya ne asankhya gaayon ko apane baade main niruddh kar rakhaa tha
 Indra has the credit for taking out those cows for the welfare of the people
 kuch vidvan ahi-vinaash, vrutra-vadh, shambar-sanhaar evam bal-vimardanadi kaa acyaropan karke surya rup main indra dwaara dhruvapradeshy andhkaar kaa naash athwa jalon ko jamaa dene vaali ghor sardi kaa vinaash athwa ahirupi meghon kaa vimardan karke jal-vimochan athwa balarupi meghon se aachchann surya kii kiranrupi gaayon ke vimukt kiye jane kii kalpana karte hai, jo satya se adhik dur nahin prathit hota
 By saying 'yah Sompa', the sage has also pointed towards Indra's paranoia
 ‘som’ indra kaa parampriy peya padaarth he
 No other deity like him can perform mon-paan
 ‘som’ use yudhon ke liye shakti or sphurti pradaan karata he
 Because of being a som-savi, Indra is loved by those who worship Som or cook it and prove it
 aise logon kii vah raksha karata he
 Not only this, he also rewards such dear people with wealth
 yah baat duusari he ki vah som paayi he, apane apujakon kaa apane aayudh vajra se vadh karata he, shudron ko adhogati pradaan karne vaala athwa apane apujakon ko narak pradaan karne vaala he, phir bhi vah apane anya sadgunon ke kaaran sarvatha poojaneey he
 The creatures of the earth always bow down to him
 log usase yah prarthana kiya karte hai ki ‘he indra! sundar putr-pautradi se yukt hokar tathaa tumhaare priypaatr bane hue ham sadaa tumhaari prarthana main tatpar rahen
 ' is prakaar spasht he ki indra vaidic devi-devataaon main sarvopari or sarvottam sthaan kaa adhikari he
 Vrittravadha has great importance in Indra's Charitavali
 rugveda main indra kaa naam saat dev-yugmon main bhi aata he
 In such pairs, 11 Suktas are for indra-agni, 9 Sukta for indra-varuna, 7 for indra-vayu, 2 indra-som, 2 indra-jupiter, 1 indra-vishnu and 1 Sukta for indra-pushan
 
 inamen se sabake saath indra kii samanta hone ke saath bhinnataayen bhi hai
 For example, the combination of Indra and Varuna can be taken
 yadhyapi varun kaa varnan kaaphi kam sookhton main he, parantu ve indra ke baad sarvaadhik mahneey maane gayi hai
 There is a joint description of Indra and Varuna in the 9 Suktas
 donon main anek samantaayein hai
 It is said that Indravarun, the suzerain of the world, dug the paths of the corridors and made the Sun move in the Dulok
 ve vrutra ko pachhadte hai
 Are helpful in war
 upaskon ko vijay pradaan karte hai
 Krukkarma throws his unfailing thunderbolt at Palmers
 in samaantaaon ke baavjood donon main kai vaishamy bhi hai :- According to the natural theme in the Upanishads, sometimes, Indra is also shown to be eager to attain knowledge
 chaandogopanishad se aisi ek katha di ja rahi he :-prajapati kii ukti thi ki paparahit, jarashunya, mrityu-shok aadi vikaron se rahit aatma ko jo koi jaan letaa he, vah sampurna lok tathaa sabhi kaamanaayon ko praapt kar letaa he
 Hearing the utterances of Prajapati, both the deity and the asuras became eager to know that soul, so Indra, the king of the gods, and Virochan, the king of the asuras, approached the Prajapati with mutual jealousy
 donon ne battis varsh tak brahmacharya paalan kiya, taduparant prajapati ne unke aane kaa prayojan poocha
 Knowing his curiosity, Prajapati asked him to look at himself in the water supplied with water and told him that he is a soul
 donon sakoron main apana-apana pratibimb dekhakar, santusht hokar chal pade
 Prajapati thought that whether he was a god or an asura, he would be defeated without interviewing the soul
 virochan santusht man se asuron ke paas pahunche or unhen bataaya ki aatma hi poojaneey he
 By taking care of him, man obtains both worlds
 devataaon ke paas pahunchne se purv hi indra ne sochaa ki sakore main aabhushan pahanakar sajjit rup dikhataa he, khandit deh kaa khandit rup, andhe kaa andhaa rup, phir yah ajar-amar aatma kaise hui? ve pun: prajapati ke paas pahunche
 Prajapati again kept Indra with him for thirty-two years, and then said - 'the one who is worshiped in the dream is the wanderer, the soul, the nectar, the abbey and the Brahma
 ' indra pun: punah shankaa lekar prajapati kii seva main prastut hue
 In this way, by keeping Indra in celibacy for thrice thirty-two years and once for five years, Prajapati made him fully aware of the nature of the soul in this way: - puranic devmandal main indra kaa vah sthaan nahin he jo vaidic devmandal main he
 The importance of trimurti-brahma, Vishnu and Shiva increases in the mythological pantheon
 indra phir bhi devadheeraj mana jaataa he
 He lives in Amaravati, the capital of Dev-lok
 yaheen nandan van he, parijaat tathaa kalpavriksha he
 Sudharma is his council of ministers and his cabinet
 shachi athwa indrani patni, airavat hathi tathaa astr vajra athwa ashani he
 The name of his horse is Uchhaiःrāva
 jab bhi koi maanav apni tapasya se indrapad praapt karnaa chahta he to indra kaa singhaasana sankat main pad jaataa he
 In order to protect his throne, Indra is often found to be seductive by captivating the ascetics
 puraanon main is sambandh kii anek kathaayen milti hai
 The mythical Indra is depicted as a powerful, prosperous and luxurious king
 anek shaktiyon se yukt tathaa maanya raja hone par bhi kabhi-kabhi inhen asanyat evam uddhat bhi dikhaaya gaya he, jiske kaaran inkaa patan bhi hote rahaa he
 a story of the fall from Durvasa's curse is given further
 ek baar durvasa rishi ne vidyadhri se praapt santanak pushpon kii ek maala aashirwad ke saath indra ko diya
 Indra had such an item of opulence that he placed that flower on his elephant's forehead
 pushp ke prabhaav se hathi uski sugandh se aakarshith hokar hokar use soonghakar prithvi par phenk diya
 Indra was unable to handle it
 durvasa ne unhen shrihin hone kaa shraap diya
 Amravati also became extremely corrupt
 indra pehle brihaspati kii or phir brahma kii sharan main pahunche
 All the gods went to Vishnu
 unhone lakshmi ko sagar-putree hone kii ajna di
 Hence Lakshmi went to the ocean
 vishnu ne lakshmi ke parityag kii vibhinn sthitiyon kaa varnan karke unhen sagar-manthan karne kaa aadesh diya
 Among the many gems that emerged from the churning, Lakshmi was also there
 lakshmi ne narayan ko varmala dekar prasann kiya
 Lakshmi gave the gods the boon of not deviating from Trilok anymore
 devataaon kaa raja indra kehalaata tha
 It is mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana that on the festival named Meghgiri, the gods anointed the green colored horse with Pakhasasana Indra to the post of king
 ramayana main bhi inhen varsha kaa devtaa mana gaya he
 As a result of Gautama's curse, he has also been called Ariesavrishan
 ramayana main inkaa chithran kathor shaasha, mahan yoddha, vishwavandy lokapal tathaa sahanubhutisheel devtaa ke saath-saath vilaasi, irshyaasheel evam shadyantri ke rup main bhi hua he
 Seeing Hung reached heaven, he dropped him upside down
 inhone ambarish ke yajna-pashu kaa apharan kar liya tha
 When Ambarish made Shunhasahep, the middle son of Ritchik, as a sacrifice animal, he was pleased with Shunshape's praise and saved him and made him live long
 inke prati aadar bhav tathaa sankat se bachaane kii bhaavana jan-saamaanya main barkaraar he
 Kausalya also calls upon Indra to protect Rama in the Van Yatra
 ramayana main inkaa shadyantri rup bhi dikhataa he
 In order to disturb the asceticism of a truthful and pious ascetic, he gave him his best pillar as a heritage
 vaidic indra bhaybheet nahin hote the
 In the Ramayana, Indra also shivered with fear of Ravana
 marutt ke yajna ke samay ravan ko upasthit dekhakar indra mor ban gayi the
 However his bravery has been unquestioned
 shachi se vivaah ke liye inhone shachi ke pita pulom tathaa chhalpurvak shachi ko harne vaale anuhlad ko bhi maar daalaa tha
 Seeing Devasena being annihilated at the time of Ravana's invasion of heaven, he confronted Ravana without any panic and turned him from war
 meghnad maaya ke bal se hi inhen bandi bana paaya tha
 Seeing the battle of rama-ravana, the god-gandhar-eunuchs said that this war is not the same because Ravana has a chariot and Rama is on foot
 at: indra ne apana rath ram ke liye bheja, jisamen indra kaa kavach, vishaal dhanush, baan tathaa shakti bhi the
 With folded hands, Matali asked Ramchandra to take the things of Rathadi and slay Ravana in the same way as the great Indra slay the demons
 yuddh-samaapti ke baad ram ne matli ko ajna di ki vah indra kaa rath aadi lautaakar le jaay
 In the context of Indra, some people make meaningless demonstration of their scholarship by giving arbitrary Vedic references to the mythology of Ahalya and arbitrary interpretation of it
 vaise log vaidic sandarbh ke naam par ahalya kaa arth 'bina hal chalaayi hui bhoomi' arth karte hai
 Essentially the first thing in this context is that the word 'ahalya' or 'ahilya' has not been used in the Rigveda
 rugveda hi nahin, anya vaidic samhitagranthon main bhi yah shabd nahin he
 It is only mentioned in the Brahmin texts
 shatapath brahman main indra ke liye 'ahalyaayai jaar' shabd kaa prayog hua he
 Apparently this experiment points to the same story which is described in the Valmiki Ramayana etc
 texts
 duusari baat yah ki rugveda main 'hal' shabd kaa bhi prayog nahin hua he
 The word 'longal' has been used in the Rigveda for the plow used in agriculture
 hal ke liye prayukt doosraa shabd he 'sira' anya samhita granthon tathaa brahmanon main bhi 'hal' kaa prayog nahin he
 In fact, the use of the plow may have started during the time of the Vedangas and it has been used more in secular Sanskrit
 aisi sthiti main ahalya kii purvokt vyakhya kam-se-kam vaidic sandarbhon se bhinn athwa dur avashya he
 The matter of symbolic interpretation is possible for many mythological stories and such efforts have been done
 parantu indra tathaa ahalya kii katha ko managasaint vaidic sansparsh dekar uske katharoop ko ram kaa ishwartv siddh karne ke liye ramakatha ke kaviyon kii kalpana maananaa vastav main ram tathaa ishwar ke prati apni tathyaheen ashraddha prakat karnaa hi he jo vastutah apni vyaktigat manyata kii baat he; kisi gyanakoshiya saamagree ke liye sarvatha anupyukt he
 The story of indra-ahalya episode is given in Valmiki Ramayana
 indra ne gautam kii dharmapatni ahalya kaa satitv apharan kiya tha
 The story goes like this - Shachipati Indra told Ahalya, knowing Gautama's absence from the ashram and wearing a monkey's costume

 Hey very beautiful! Kamijans do not wait for the season for indulgence, that is, they do not believe that women should have intercourse only when they are retired from menstruation
 atah he sundar qamar vaali! main tumhaare saath samagam karnaa chahta hum
 
 18
 
 vishwamitra kehete hai ki he raghunandan! vah moorkha muniveshdhari indra ko pahchaan kar bhi is vichaar se ki 'swayan devraj indra mujhe chaahate hai', is prastaav se sahamat ho gayi
 
 19
 
 tadnantar vah santushtchitt hokar devataaon main shreshth indra se boli ki he surottam! main krutharth ho gayi
 Now you leave here soon
 
 20
 
 Then Indra also laughed and said, o beautiful buttress! i am completely satisfied
 ab jahaan se aayaa hum, vahaan chalaa jaaounga
 Thus after joining with Ahalya, he left the hut
 valmikiy ramayana main is prasang kaa kaaphi had tak maanviya rup main varnan he
 There is no mention of Ahalya being a stone or a river here
 shaap main bas yahi kaha gaya he ki vah lambe samay tak sabase chhipakar rahegi
 By drinking the wind, that is, one will be fasting and on the arrival of Rama, his hospitality will come in the former form
 shaap kii samaapti ke bare main bhi spasht likhaa he ki ram ke darshan se pehle usko dekh paanaa kisi ke liye kathin tha, ram ke darshan ho jane par vah sabko dikhaayi dene lagi
 It is quite clear from this that the idea of having a rock or river is much later than Valmiki Ramayana
 tridevon kii shreshthata sthapit hone tathaa indra kii mahatta nirantar kam hone ke kram main hi sara dosha indra par hi madh diya gaya or ahalya kaa charitra paavan mana gaya
 Some scholars have tried to give symbolic meaning to this story
 dharmik granthon main rahasywaadee shabdaawalee kaa prayog prachinkaal se prachlit he usapar vaidic shabdaawalee sone pe suhaaga kaa kaam karti thi at: uparokt kathan pratikatmak bhi ho saktaa he
 On analyzing, different meanings are revealed: - loukik sanskrit main ahalya kaa ek arth hota he " bina hal chali " yani banjar bhoomi
 As is known, Indra used to attack other countries, so as a result, the green land would become barren
 Indra, the source of this food or the source of the forest from which fruits, tubers and roots etc
 were destroyed and destroyed their enemies
 Used to deliver
 kalantar main vishwamitra ne ram se jab kaha ki ye ahalya he, to ho saktaa he unka taatpary ho ki ye "bina hal chali" yani banjar bhoomi he ise upjau banaao or ram ne us bhoomi ko phir se upjau banaaya ho
 The second context may be in reference to 'river' according to 'brahmapurana' and "anand Ramayana"
 apbhransh main 'sira ' shabd ke do arth hai ek to pathar or doosraa sukhi nadi
 As it has been analyzed as agriculture, it can also be that in reality there will be a river which goes to Indra's enemy country and its main source of water must have been dried by Indra so that the enemy country cannot get water
 And later Rama would have made it watery
 is prakaar dekhen to ahalya-prasang prakruti kaa maanvikaran maatr he
 The mythological form of Indra is found in Mahabharata
 yahaan unka vaidic-sahitya main varnit gaurav nahin rah gaya he
 They are specifically referred to as 'shakra'
 apana devraj pad kho jane kaa bhay inhen baraabar sataaya karata he or isse bachane ke liye ye uchit-anuchit praytn karte rahete hai
 Fearful of Vishwamitra's tenacity, Apsara named Maneka sent her to dissolve his penance
 sharadvat ke tap se bhaybheet hokar jaanapadi naamak apsara ko unka tap bhang karne bheja
 Fearing the heat of Yavakrit, Indra assumed the form of a Brahmin and meditated with him
 valmikiy ramayana main varnit ahalya-prasang kaa ullekh mahabharat main bhi miltaa he
 Here he is considered a rapist
 rugveda main ullikhit indra ke 'harishmashru' hone kaa kathatmak samarthan mahabharat main bhi miltaa he
 It has been said here that Indra had to suffer due to the curse of Gautama
 ye hi arjuna ke pita the
 In fear of Vritrasura, all the gods had dedicated their powers to them
 isliye arjuna ko unase hi divyastra praapt karne ke liye kaha gaya
 Many stories related to these are given in Mahabharata
 indra vastutah ek pad kaa naam he
 The term of king of gods is called 'indra'
 us pad par baithne vaale vyakti kaa naam bhi indra ho jaataa he
 Its signs are found in many mythology and descriptions, but it is well-known from many references of Mahabharata that it is the name of a verse
 jin-jin kathaon main ye pad chhin jane se bhaybheet hote hai un kathaon ke saath indra banane kii anya vyaktiyon kii kathaon ko milakar dekhne par baat bilkul spasht ho jaati he
 In many places, the term 'indra' has been used instead of the person's use
 kuch sandarbh drashtavy hai :- Shiva fainted Indra and put him in a cave along with the other four Indras of the past
 indrapad kii abhilaashaa rakhane vaale nirkasur kaa vishnu ne vadh kiya
 The sages, gods led by Shakra, asked Skanda to become the 'indra' of the gods
 brahmahatya se grast ho jane par shakr ke indra-pad chhod dene par nahush 'indra' bane
 After the fall of Nahusha, Shakra regained Indra-post by performing the ritual of Ashwamedha Yajna as per Vishnu's orders
 inke sivaa bhi indra-pad ke anek spasht ullekh mahabharat main uplabdh hai
 In the first and second chapters of the third part in Srivishnupurana and in the first and triodas chapter of the eighth wing of the Bhagavata Mahapuran, different names of the 14 manvantaras are given
 mahakavi swayambhu virachit 'paum chariu' mahakavy kii atiumo sandhi main ek aise vyakti kii katha di gayi he jisane devraj indra se prabhavit hokar apane naam ke saath sab kuch indravat karnaa chaha tha

 When Indra became king, he named the minister from the assistant students, named Jupiter, Elephant Airavat, similarly Pawan, Kubera, Varuna, Yama and Chandra and named Urvashi, Rambha, Tilottama etc
 after their singers and declared that whatever signs of Indra
 They are mine too

 Listening to his prosperity, the ruler of Lanka attacked the demon Mali with his brother Sumali and a large army
 ghamaasan yuddh ke pashchaat rakshasraj maaraa gaya tathaa sumali pataal lanka main pravesh kar gaya
 Indra began to rule for some time
 yah katha paum chariu kii anya anek kathaon kii tarah hi sanskrit-parampara se bilkul bhinn he
 Not only is this Vidyadhar Indra mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana, it is also clearly written about the slaughter of Mali that at the time of the invasion of Swargalok by the demons, Vishnu killed him with the Sudarshan Chakra
 bogajkoi shilaalekh ke anusaar mitnni jati ke devataaon main varun, mitra evam naasatyon ke saath indra kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he 
 Indra has a place in Iranian religion, but not in the form of charity, but in charity

 The Muslim League idea of a Muslim nationalism involving all Muslims of the Indian subcontinent seemed to lose ethnic nationalism in 1971, when East Pakistan, a Bengali-dominated province, fought with support with Pakistan and followed with India

 Establishing a work-causal relationship between the findings of natural sciences, the study of the earth's variations from a human point of view is the essence of geography
 prithvi kii sataha par jo sthaan vishesh hai unki samtaon tathaa vishmataaon kaa kaaran or unka spashtikaran bhugol kaa nijee kshetra he
 The word geography is made up of two words ie earth and round
 bhugol ek ore anya shrunkhalabaddh vigyaanon se praapt gyaan kaa upyog us seemaa tak karata he jahaan tak vah ghatnaon or vishleshanon kii samiksha tathaa unke sambandhon ke yathasambhav samuchit samanvay karne main sahaayak hota he
 On the other hand, knowledge derived from other sciences, which geography uses, has many etymological assumptions and prescribed classifications
 yadi ye dharanaayen or vargeekaran bhugolic uddeshyon ke liye upyogi na hon, to bhugol ko nijee vyutpattik dharanaayen tathaa vargeekaran kii pranali viksit kerani hoti he
 Therefore, geography helps in the growth of human knowledge in three ways: sarvapratham pracheen unani vidwaan iratosthaniz ne bhugol ko dharaatal ke ek vishishtvigyaan ke rup main manyata di
 Subsequently, Herodotus and the Roman scholars Strabo and Claudius Ptolemy gave geography a definitive form of history

 yah bataata he ki kaise, kyon or kahan maanviya va prakritik kriyakalapon kaa udbhav hota he or kaise ye kriyalap ek duusare se antarsambandhit hai
 The study method of geography has been changing
 praarambhik vidwaan varnanaatmak bhugolvetta the
 Later, geography evolved into analytical geography
 aaj yah vishay na keval varnan karata he, balki vishleshan ke saath-saath bhavishyavaanee bhi karata he
 According to early evidences, the scholars of this time understood the physical facts of the Earth through map-making and astronomical measurements
 bhugol main aarambhik vidwaan dene kaa shrey yunaan ko hi jaataa he, jisamen pramukh the homer, herrodotus, thels, arastu or iretosthanij
 This period began from the middle of the 15th century to the end of the 18th century
 yah kaal aarambhik bhugolvettaon kii khojon or anveshanon dwaara vishwa kii bhautik va saanskrithik prakruti ke bare main vrahat gyaan pradaan karata he
 The early 17th century witnessed the beginning of new 'scientific geography'
 columbus, vascodigama, magalen or thomas cook is kaal ke pramukh anveshankartta the
 Varenius, Kant, Humboldt and Ritter were prominent geographers of this period
 in vidwaanon ne maanchitrkala ke vikaas main yogadan diya or naveen sthalon kii khoj kii, jiske falswaroop bhugol ek vaigyanik vishay ke rup main viksit hua
 Ritter and Humboldt are often cited as the founders of modern geography
 saamanytah 19veen sadi ke uttarardh kaa kaal aadhunik bhugol kaa kaal mana jaataa he
 In fact, Reitzel was the first modern geographer, who built the structure of modern geography on the foundations established by long-standing geographers
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad bhugol kaa vikaas badi teevr gati se hua
 American and European geographers such as Hartshorne contributed the maximum during this period
 hartshorn ne bhugol ko ek aise vigyaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jo kshetreey vibhinnataaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Current geographers view regional approaches and systematic approaches as complementary approaches rather than contradictory approaches
 bhugol ne aaj vigyaan kaa darja praapt kar liya he, jo prithvi tal par upasthit vividh prakritik or saanskrithik roopon kii vyakhya karata he
 Geography is a holistic and interrelated field study that studies the change in spatial structure from past to future
 is tarah bhugol kaa kshetra vividh vishyon jaise sainya sevaaon, paryaavaran prabandhan, jal sansaadhan, aapadaa prabandhan, mausam vigyaan, niyojan or vividh saamaajik vigyaanon main he
 Apart from this, the geographer can be helpful in daily life related events like tourism, relocation, accommodation and health activities
 vidwaanon ne bhugol ke teen mukhya vibhaag kiye hai- ganitiya bhugol, bhautik bhugol tathaa maanav bhugol
 In the first division, the relation of Earth with other planets and satellites etc
 of the solar world is described and its relative relationship with them is described
 is vibhaag kaa bahut kuch sambandh ganit jyotish se bhi he
 In the second division, the physical form of the earth is described and it is known from whom the river, mountain, country, city, etc
 are called and where are so many countries, cities, rivers or mountains etc
 saadharantah bhugol se uske isi vibhaag kaa arth liya jaataa he
 The third department of geography is human geography, under which political geography also comes, in which it is discussed which departments of the earth are in view of politics, governance, language, caste and civilization etc
 and what is the extent and extent of those departments etc
 
 ek anya drushti se bhugol ke do pradhan ang he : shrunkhalabaddh bhugol tathaa pradeshik bhugol
 Regional geography is the byproduct of centering the coordinate of the branches of chain geography at a particular location on the Earth

 There are 5 oceans on Earth: Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean | South Ocean Topography - shail - aagney shail kayantarit shail avsaadee shail | Atmosphere, season, temperature, heat, heat, decay heat, humidity
 maanav bhugol, bhugol kii vah shakha he jo maanav samaaj ke kriyakalapon or unke parinaam swaroop bane bhugolic pratirupon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Under this comes political, cultural, social and economic aspects of human beings
 maanav bhugol ko anek shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he, jaise:' Geography has been defined in various forms in different periods of history
 pracheen unani vidwaanon ne bhugolic dharanaon ko do pakshon main rakhaa tha- The emergence of territorial approach in geography also emphasizes the descriptive nature of geography
 hambolt ke anusaar, bhugol prakruti se sambandhit vigyaan he or yah prithvi par paye jane vaale sabhi sadhano kaa adhyayan va varnan karata he
 There are three main branches of geography based on Hetner and Hartshorne: physical geography, human geography and regional geography
 bhautik bhugol main prakritik parighatnaon kaa ullekh hota he, jaise ki jalwaayu vigyaan, mrudaa or vanaspati
 Human geography describes the relationship between surface and human society
 bhugol ek intaraa-anushaasanic vishay he
 Geography has close links with mathematics, natural sciences and social sciences
 jabaki anya vigyaan vishisht prakaar kii parighatnaon kaa hi varnan karte hai, bhugol vividh prakaar kii un parighatnaon kaa bhi adhyayan karata he, jinka adhyayan anyavigyaanon main bhi shaamil hota he
 Thus geography has established itself as a synthesized study of interrelated behaviors
 bhugol sthanon kaa vigyaan he
 Geography is both natural and social science, which studies both human and environment
 yah bhautik va saanskrithik vishwa ko jodta he
 Physical geography studies the natural environment arising from the Earth's system
 maanav bhugol raajnneetik, aarthik, saamaajik, saanskrithik or janankikeey prakriyaaon se sambandhit he
 It is also related to varied use of resources
 praarambhik bhugol sirf sthanon kaa varnan karata tha
 Although it is still included in the study of geography, there has been a change in the description of its patterns in the last few years
 bhugolic parighatnaon kaa varnan saamanytah do upagamon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he jaise pradeshik or krambaddh
 Explains the creation and characteristics of territorial approach areas
 yah is baat kaa varnan karne kaa prayaas karata he ki koi kshetra kaise or kyon ek duusare se alag he
 The state can be physical, social, economic, political, demographic etc
 krambaddh upaagam parighatnaon tathaa saamaanya bhugolic mahatvon ke dwaara sanchalit he
 Each phenomenon is studied on the basis of geography, regional variations and their relationship with each other
 bhugol kii praayah sabhi shakhaon vishesh rup se bhautik bhugol kii shakhaon main tathyon ke vishleshan main ganitiya vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Scientific study of celestial bodies is done in astronomy
 bhootal kii ghatnaon or tatwon par akashiya pindon - surya, chandramaa, dhoomaketuon aadi kaa pratyaksh prabhaav hota he
 That is why geography studies the solar system, the movement of the sun on its virtual path, the daily and annual movements of the earth and the changes that occur as a result - day and night and season changes, lunar arts, solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, etc
 in tatwon or ghatnaon kaa moulik adhyayan khagol vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Thus geography has a closer relationship with astronomy
 bhu-vigyaan prithvi ke sanghathan, sanrachana tathaa itihaas ke vaigyanik adhyayan san sambandhit he
 This includes the study of the constituents of the earth, the forces acting on the surface and the structures produced from them, the structure and distribution of the crustacean rocks, geological periods of the earth, etc
 bhugol main sthalroopon ke vishleshan main bhuvigyaan ke siddhanton tathaa saakshyon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 In this way, physical geography, especially geomorphology, has a very close relationship with geology
 bhootal ko prabhavit karne vaale bhugolic karkon main jalwaayu sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee or mahatvapurn kaarak he
 Meteorology studies the atmosphere, especially the physical processes occurring in it and the various processes related to the associated lithosphere and hydrosphere
 iske antargat vayudab, taapmaana, pawan, ardrata, varshan, meghachhadan, surya prakaash aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 These elements of meteorology are also analyzed in geography
 jal vigyaan prithvi par sthit jal ke adhyayan se sambandhit he
 Along with this, it also contains the study of water exploration, use, control and conservation
 mahasagariya tatwon ke sthanik vitaran kaa adhyayan bhugol kii ek shakha samudr vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Oceanography involves the study of ocean water temperature, density, salinity, ocean waves, currents, etc

 Thus we find that there is a very close and close relationship between geography and hydrology
 mrudaa vigyaan mitti ke nirmaan, sanrachana or visheshta kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karata he
 The distribution of soils on the ground floor is studied under soil geography
 mitti kaa adhyayan krishi bhugol kaa bhi mahatvapurn vishay he
 Thus, the closeness of geography is also found from soil science

 Botany is the scientific study of plant life and its entire world forms
 prakritik vanaspatiyon ke sthanik vitaran or visheshtaon kaa vishleshan bhautik bhugol kii shakha jaev bhugol or upashakha vanaspati yaa padap bhugol main kii jaati he
 Animal science or zoology is the scientific study of the structure, classification and functions of all types of animal life
 manushya ke liye jantu jagat or pashu sansaadhan kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 Animals are very useful to humans

 It is clear from these facts that geography and political science are closely related
 janankiki yaa janasankhyikee ke antargat jansankhya ke aakaar, sanrachana, vikaas aadi kaa parimanatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In this, along with the collection, classification, evaluation, analysis and projection of population data, demographic models and procedures are also explained
