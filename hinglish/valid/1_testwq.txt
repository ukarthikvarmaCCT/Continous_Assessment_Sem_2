 In ancient times, "niharika" used to refer to any elaborate object seen in the astro
 akashganga se pare ki kisi bhi gallexi ko niharika hi kaha jaataa tha
 The names were later changed when it was discovered by Edwin Hubble's research
 udhaaharan ke liye andromeda gallexi ko pehle andromeeda nabula ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Stars and planetary circles are often born in nebulae, as seen in eagles

 On 26 November 1610 nicolas-claude Fabi de Piresque invented the Orion nebulae using a telescope
 1618 main jon beptist seast ne bhi is niharika kaa adhyayan kiya
 However, there was no detailed study of the Orion nebula before 1659, ie Christian Heijens, who considered himself the first to invent nebulae or this celestial mist
 1715 main, edmund heley ne chah niharikaon kii ek suchi prakashit kii

 Charles Messier then made a list of 103 nebulae by 1781, though his main reason for doing so was to avoid misidentification of comets
 iske baad wiliam harchel or unki bahan caroline harchel kii koshishon se niharikaon kii sankhya main atyadhik ijapha hua
 His Catalog of One Thousand New Nebulai and Cluster of Stars was published in 1786
 The second list of one thousand was published in 1789 and the third and final list of 510 was published in 1802
 apane adhiktar kaam ke dauraan, wiliam harchel ko yah yakeen tha ki ye niharikaayen sitaron ke aviksit samooh maatr the
 However, in 1790, he discovered a star surrounded by ambiguity and concluded that it was an actual rainbow or nebula, rather than a large distance group
 1864 ke aarambh main, wiliam haggins ne lagbhag 70 niharikaon ke spectra yaa shrenee kii jaanch kii
 unhone paaya ki unamem se lagbhag ek tihaai main gas ke samavesh kii vistrut shrenee thi
 The rest appeared to have an ever-widening range and were considered a cluster of stars
 1912 main, jab vesto sleefer ne yah darshaya ki merope taare ke aasapaas kii niharikaon kii shrenee pliyedas khule taraguchh se milti he, tab inamen ek teesraa varg joda gaya
 Thus the nebula shines through the reflected light of the stars
 sleefer or edwin habal ne anek visarit niharikaon se inaki vistrut shreniyon ko ekatra karnaa jari rakhaa tathaa pataa lagaaya ki inamen se 29 utsarjan spectra dikhaate hai or 33 main taron ke prakaash kaa satat spectra tha
 In 1922, Hubble announced that almost all the nebulae are associated with stars, and that their light comes from starlight
 unhone yah bhi pataa lagaaya ki utsarjan spectrum kii niharikaayen lagbhag hameshaa B1 yaa usase adhik garm se judy rahati hai, jabaki satat spectra yukt niharikaayen apekshaakrit thande taron ke saath prakat hoti hai
 Both Hubble and Henry Norris Russell conclude that the nebulae surrounding the hot stars are changing in some way
 anek niharikaon kaa gathan antartaarkeey madhyam main gas ke aapasi gurutvkarshan kii vajah se hota he
 Due to the constriction of matter under its own weight, many massive stars can be formed in the center and their ultraviolet light ionizes the surrounding gases and makes them visible on light waves
 rojet nebyal or pelicon nebyal is prakaar kii niharikaon ke udhaaharan hai
 The size of these types of nebulae, known as the HII region, depends on the size of the actual clouds of gas
 yahi vah jagah hai jahaan sitaron kaa gathan hota he
 The stars formed from it are sometimes referred to as a young, loose cluster
 kuch niharikaon kaa gathan supernova main honevaale visphot arthath vishaal or alp-jivi taron ke ant ke parinamswarup hota he
 The material disintegrated by the explosion of a supernova is ionized by energy and this causes the formation of a solid object to be formed

 sitaron ke paas kii visarit niharikaayen pratibimb niharika kaa udhaaharan hai
 Most nebulae can be called diffuse nebulae, which means they are elaborate and do not fall within the limits of any common definition

 in utsarjan niharikaon ko aksar HII kshetra kaha jaataa he, "HII" shabd kaa upyog vyavsaayik khagol vigyaan main aksar ynit hydrogen ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Compared to emission nebulae, reflection nebulae themselves do not form sufficient visible light lines, but rather reflect the light of their surrounding stars
 andhri yaa gahari niharikaayen visarit niharikaon jaisi hi hai, lekin unhen unke dwaara utsarjit yaa prativimbit prakaash dwaara nahin dekha ja saktaa
 iske bajaae, unhen dur ke taron yaa utsarjan niharikaon ke saamne ke gahare badalon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Although these nebulae appear differently on light waves, they are bright sources of emission on all infrared or infrared waves
 yah utsarjan mukhyatah niharikaon ke bheetar kii dhul se aata he
 Planetary nebulae are nebulae formed from a gas-rich shell emanating from a low-moss asymptomatic massive branch star when it turns into a white dwarf
 ye niharikaayen, dhundhale utsarjan yukt utsarjit niharikaayen hai jo sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon jaisi hoti hai
 Technically, these are HII regions because most will be hydrogen ionized
 haalanki, grahon kii niharikaayen adhik ghani evam sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon kii apeksha adhik thos hoti hai
 Planetary nebulae have been given this name because the first astronomers who studied these objects thought that nebulae resembled the planets or discs of the planets, however, they are not related to planets
 ek proto planetary nebyal ek khagoleey vastu he, jo bhootpurv ananthasparshi vishaal shakha kii sthiti or uske baad ke grahon kii niharika ke charan ke bich ek taare ke twarit taarakeey kramik vikaas kaa alpakaaleen prakaran he

 a supernova occurs when a high-moss star reaches the end of its life
 jab sitare ke mul yaa centre main parmaanu sanlayan band ho jaataa he, tab sitara vighatit ho jaataa he
 The leaking gas either rebounds or becomes so hot that it spreads out from the center and causes an explosion of stars
 gas kaa failaa hua khol, ek vishesh prakaar ke visarit niharika supernova avshesh kii rachana karata he
 Although most of the light and X-ray emission of the supernova remnant originates from ionized gas, the bulk of the radio emission is non-thermal emission known as synchrotron emission

 ek baar mastishk main pahunch jane ke baad, adenosine receptor ke ek gaiyr-chayanshil pratidwandvi ke rup main isaki pramukh kriya shuru ho jaati he
 Caffeine molecules are similar in structure to adenosine and bind adenosine receptors to the surface of cells without activating them
 Therefore, caffeine acts as a competitive inhibitor

 Since caffeine is the antagonist of the central nervous system's receptors primarily for the neurotransmitter adenosine, caffeine is consumed regularly, so they are well adapted to the continued presence of this drug, because of the adenosine receptors in the central nervous system
 The number has increased considerably
 pehla, caffeine ke uttejnadaayak prabhaav kaaphi kam ho jate hai, is ghatana ko sahansheel anukulan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Second, as these adaptive responses to caffeine make individuals more susceptible to adenosine, caffeine intake effectively increases the general physiological effect of adenosine, resulting in unpleasant withdrawal symptoms in tolerant users

 Since this condition may simulate somatic mental disorders such as fear disorder, general anxiety disorder, two-polar disorder, or even schizophrenia, many medical experts believe that caffeine-alcoholics are equally misdiagnosed
 And they are given medications unnecessarily, while stopping caffeine intake can only cure caffeine-induced psychosis

 However, another 2008 study found no association between miscarriage and caffeine intake
 britain kii food standerds agency ne sifarish kii he ki garbhvatee mahilaon ko pratidin 200 millilitre se kam caffeine - do cap instent coffee yaa aadha se do cap taaje coffee ke baraabar - lenaa chahie
 The FSA stated that the study's design made it impossible to determine whether this difference is due to caffeine itself, or other lifestyle differences other than that are probably associated with excessive consumption of caffeine, but the decision to recommend being vigilant was done
 kaisar permanent divijan of research ke dow de-kun lee ne american jarnal of obstetrics or ginocology main ek aalekh main likhaa he ki pratidin 200 millilitre yaa usase adhik lenaa, do yaa do se adhik cap lene jitna he, "isse garbhpaat kaa khatra kaaphi adhik bad jaataa he"

 jis jal main caffeine ke alaava anya bahut tarah ke yogic hote hai jo coffee ke swaad ko badhaate hai, us jal ko sakriy charcol se paarit karaayaa jaataa he, jisase caffeine alag ho jaataa he
 After that, without extracting caffeine the coffee with its original taste can be dried and evaporated by separating the beans from that water
 coffee nirmaataa caffeine ko alag nikaal lete hai or sheethal peya main iskaa istemaal karne ke liye or bagaiyr nuskhaa ke caffeine kii goliyon ke rup main phir se bech dete hai
 Micro-carbon dioxide is an excellent non-ionic solvent for caffeine and is far safer than organic solvents, which are used as an alternative
 nishkarshan kii prakriya saral he: 31
1 degree celsius se adhik taapmaana par hare coffee beans par CO2 daalaa jaataa he or 73 atm kaa dabaav daalaa jaataa he
 In such a situation, the state of CO2 becomes extremely subtle: it has a gas-like characteristic that allows it to go too deep into the beans, but it also has the characteristic of a liquid that dissolves 97–99% of caffeine
 phir CO2 vaale caffeine main se caffeine nikaalane ke liye ucch dabaav ke saath pani kaa chhidkaav kiya jaataa he
 Caffeine can then be separated by adsorption in charcoal or by distillation or re-crystallization or reverse osmosis
 pehle istemaal hone vaale chlorinated va aromatic vilaayakon kii tulana main ethil acitate jaise carbonic vilaayak kam swasthya va paryaavarniya jokhim upasthit karte hai
 Another method is to use triglyceride oil obtained from used coffee plantations

 To make the lining, you have to make a light coating of the glue on which the picture is to be made, after drying, two three coats of white color, linseed oil and varnish are added

 But it requires great efficiency because it is not possible to improve these types of pictures once they have deteriorated like a picture inscribed from Burush
 chitra puraa ho jane par puraane chitrakaar kuch maheenon baad usapar varnish lagaate the jisase vah mausami parivartanon se aprabhavit rahe
 Varnish also adds some shine to the pictures

 Before this he tried many times to become Prime Minister but was unsuccessful
 lekin aisa nahin hai ki morarji pradhanmantri banane ke qaabil nahin the
 In fact, he was unfortunate that despite being the senior-most leader, he was not made Prime Minister even after the deaths of Pandit Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri
 morarji desai march 1977 main desh ke pradhanmantri bane lekin pradhanmantri ke rup main inkaa kaarykaal purna nahin ho paaya
 He had to quit as Prime Minister due to differences with Chaudhary Charan Singh
 morarji desai kaa janm 29 farvari 1896 ko gujarat ke bhadeli naamak sthaan par hua tha

 Morarji Desai was educated at Elphinstone College in Mumbai, which was considered expensive and expensive at the time
 mumbai main morarji desai ni:shulk awaas grih main rahe jo gokuldaas tejpal ke naam se prasiddh tha
 At one time, 40 students could live there
 vidhyaarthee jivan main morarji desai ausat buddhi ke vivekshil chaatr the
 He was also made the secretary of the college's debate team, but Morarji himself would hardly have participated in any debate competition
 morarji desai ne apane college jivan main hi mahatma gandhi, bal gangadhar tilak or anya congressi netaaon ke sambhaavnon ko suna tha
 Morarji Desai made up his mind to apply for the Mumbai Provincial Civil Service where direct recruitment was done by the government
 july 1917 main unhone uniwarsity training course main pravishti pai
 Here they continued to have the same rights and facilities as British people
 yahan rahete hue morarji afasar ban gaye
 In May 1918, he reached Ahmedabad on probation as a Deputy District Magistrate
 unhone chetfield naamak british colector ke antargat kaary kiya

 morarji 1937 tak gujarat pradesh congress cameti ke sachiv rahe
 He then joined the Congress cabinet of Bombay State
 is dauraan yah mana jaataa rahaa ki morarji desai ke vyaktitatva main jatiltaayen hai
 He himself puts his point above and believes it right
 is kaaran log inhen vyangy se 'sarvocch netaa' kaha karte the
 Morarji also liked to be said so
 gujarat ke samachar patron main praaia: unke is vyaktitv ko lekar vyangy bhi prakashit hote the
 His cartoons were depicted with a long stick in which he was also shown wearing a Gandhi cap
 isamen vyangy yah hota tha ki gandhiji ke vyaktitv se prabhavit lekin apni baat par ade rahane vaale ek ziddi vyakti
 Morarji Desai's many years passed in the districts due to his participation in the freedom struggle
 desh kii azaadi ke samay rashtriya raajnneeti main inkaa naam vazandaar ho chukaa tha
 But Morarji's primary interest was in state politics
 yahi kaaran he ki 1952 main inhen bombai kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 By this time Gujarat and Maharashtra were known as Bombay Province and the two states were not formed separately
 1967 main indira gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane par morarji ko up pradhanmantri or grih mantri banaaya gaya

 yahi kaaran he ki indira gandhi dwaara kiye jane vaale krantikari upayon main morarji nirantar baadha daalate rahe
 In fact, Morarji was also in the race for Prime Minister when Mr
 Kamaraj announced Indira Gandhi as Prime Minister on the advice of Syndicate
 jab vah kisi bhi tarah nahin maane to party ne is mudde par chunaav karaayaa or indira gandhi ne baari matantar se baazi maar lee
 Indira Gandhi gave him the post of Deputy Prime Minister to appease Morarji's ego

 When Indira Gandhi understood that Morarji Desai was causing difficulties for her, she started clashing on Morarji
 is kaaran unka kshubdh hona swaabhaavik tha
 In November 1969, when the Congress was split into congress-r and congress-o, Morarji Desai moved to Indira Gandhi's congress-i instead of congress-o

 For this reason, any territory or province to which the Presidency was annexed by conquest or treaty was administered under the existing rules of the same Presidency

 Yama or Pluto is the second largest dwarf planet in the Solar System
 pluto ko kabhi saura mandal kaa sabase bahari grah mana jaataa tha, lekin ab ise saura mandal ke bahari kyper ghere kii sab se badi khagoleey vastu mana jaataa he
 Pluto, like other objects in the Kuiper circle, has a smaller size and mass - only one-third the size of the Earth's moon
 suraj ke ird-gird isaki parikrama kii kaksha bhi thodi besangi he - yah kabhi to varun kii kaksha ke andar jaakar suraj se 30 khagoleey ikai dur hota he or kabhi dur jaakar surya se 45 khai par pahunch jaataa he
 Pluto is mostly made of frozen nitrogen, water ice and stone, like other objects in the Kiper circle

 Pluto has a diameter of about 2,300 km, i

 18% of the Earth

 It is said that the difference between the colors of Pluto is seen in very few objects of the solar system, that is, the colors are mostly the same
 san 1994 se lekar 2003 tak kiye gaye adhyayan main dekha gaya ke pluto ke rangon main badlaav aayaa he
 The color of the North Pole was slightly brighter and the South Pole slightly thickened
 mana jaataa he ke yah pluto par badalte mausamon kaa sanket he
 Pluto has a very thin atmosphere consisting of nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide
 jab pluto parikrama karte hue suraj se dur ho jaataa he to us par thand bad jaati he or inhi gaison kaa kuch bhaag jamkar barf kii tarah uski sataha par gir jaataa he, jis se uskaa vayumandal or bhi patala ho jaataa he

 In 1930, American astronomer Clyde Tombou discovered Pluto and was considered the ninth planet in the Solar System
 dhire-dhire pluto ke bare main kuch aisi chijen pataa chalin jo anya grahon se alag thim - These things made astronomers doubt whether there was any runaway satellite of Pluto Varun, although it was also less likely because Pluto and Varun would never come close orbiting
 phir, san 1990 ke baad, vaigyanikon ko bahut si varun-paar vastuen milane lageen jinaki kakshaayen, rup-rang or banaavat pluto se milti julati thim
 Today scientists have recognized that there is a whole circle in this area of the solar system, in which similar items are found, of which Pluto is only one
 isi ghere kaa naam kyper gheraa rakhaa gaya
 In 2004–2005, Humeya and Makemake met at the same Kiper circle, which was much larger
 2005 main kyper ghere se bhi baahar siris mila, jo pluto se bada tha
 It was different from all other planets and resembled Pluto
 antarrashtriya khagoleey sangh asamanjas main pad gaya kyonki lagane laga ke aisi kitni hi vastuen aane vaale saalon main milengi
 Either these were all planets or there was a need to stop calling Pluto something else
 13 sitambar 2006 ko is sangh ne elaan kiya ke pluto grah nahin he or unhone ek nai "bouna grah" kii shrenee sthapit kari
 Pluto, Humeya, Makemake and Aris are now called dwarf planets
