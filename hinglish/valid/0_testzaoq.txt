 As a result, the Ganges, the Godavari River, originated in the south
 godavari ke udgam ke saath hi gautam rishi ke anunay-vinay ke uparaant shivaji ne is mandir main virajman hona sweekaar kar liya
 This place came to be called Trimbak due to the three-eyed Shivshambhu sitting here

 This story is described in Shivpuran about the establishment of this Jyotirlinga
 ek baar maharishi gautam ke tapovana main rahane vaale brahmanon kii patniyaan kisi baat par unki patni ahilya se naaraaz ho gayi
 He inspired his husbands to do sage Gautama
 un brahmanon ne iske nimitt bhagavan shriganeshji kii aradhana kii
 Pleased with his worship, Ganesha appeared and asked him to ask for the groom, those Brahmins said - 'prabhu! If you are happy with us then somehow get Rishi Gautama out of this ashram
 ' unki yah baat sunakar ganeshji ne unhen aisa var maangane ke liye samajhaayaa
 But he remained firm on his request
 antat ganeshji ko vivash hokar unki baat manani padi
 To keep the mind of his devotees, he took the form of a weak cow and started living in the field of sage Gautama
 gaay ko fasal charate dekhakar rishi badi narmi ke saath haath main trin lekar use haankane ke liye lapke
 As soon as those trunks were touched, that cow fell there itself
 ab to bada haahaakaar machaa
 All the Brahmins gathered and started denouncing the sage Gautama as a cow killer
 rishi gautam is ghatana se bahut aashcharyachakit or duhkhi the
 Now all those Brahmins said that you should leave this ashram and go somewhere else
 go-hatyare ke nikat rahane se hamen bhi paap lagegaa
 Being compelled, the sage Gautama started living with his wife Ahilya a curse away from there
 kintu un brahmanon ne vahaan bhi unka rahanaa dubhar kar diya
 They started saying - 'now you have no right to do the work of Vedas and Yajnadi due to cow slaughter
 ' atyant anunay bhav se rishi gautam ne un brahmanon se prarthana kii ki aap log mere praayshchit or uddhaar kaa koi upaay bataaen
 Then he said- 'gautam! You can revolve the whole earth thrice by telling your sins everywhere to everyone
 phir lautakar yahan ek maheene tak vrath karo
 After this, after doing 101 circumambulation of 'brahmagiri' you will be purified or bring Gangaji here and bathe with water and worship Shiva with one crore earthly Shivalingas
 iske baad punah gangaji main snaan karke is brahmagiri kii 11 baar parikrama karo
 Then bathing the earthly Shivalingas with the holy water of hundred pots will save you
 brahmanon ke kathananusaar maharishi gautam ve saare kaary puure karke patni ke saath purnatah tallin hokar bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana karne lage
 Pleased with this, Lord Shiva appeared and asked him to ask for the groom
 maharishi gautam ne unase kaha- 'bhagavan main yahi chahta hoon ki aap mujhe go-hatya ke paap se mukt kar den
 'lord Shiva said-' Gautam! You are completely sinless
 go-hatya kaa aparaadh tum par chal purvak lagaaya gaya tha
 i want to punish the Brahmins of your ashram who have done this deceitfully
 ' On this Maharishi Gautam said that Lord! i have received your darshan for his sake only
 ab unhen meraa paramahit samajhakar un par aap krodh na karen
 Many sages, sages and devas gathered there, approving Gautam's talk and prayed to Lord Shiva to stay there forever

 Gangaji brought by Gautam ji also started to flow near there under the name Godavari

 During this trip, the panchmukhi gold mask of Trimbakeshwar Maharaj is seated in a palanquin and rotated in the village

 Since then there is always plenty of water in this pool

 Vikramaditya was the ardent king of Ujjain, noted for his wisdom, valor and generosity
 "vikramaditya" kii oopaadhi bhartiya itihaas main baad ke kai anya raajaaon ne praapt kii thi, jinamein gupt samraat chandragupta dwitiya or samraat hemachandra vikramaditya ullekhneey hai
 The name Raja Vikramaditya is derived from the combination of 'vikram' and 'aditya' which means 'the sun of might' or 'mighty like the sun'
 unhen vikram yaa vikramark bhi kaha jaataa he 
 The increasing trend of naming 'vikram' among Hindu infants can be partly attributed to the popularity of Vikramaditya and two series of popular folk tales about his life
 anushrut vikramaditya, sanskrit or bharat ke kshetreey bhashaaon, donon main ek lokapriy vyaktitv he
 His name is easily associated with an event or monument whose historical details are unknown, although the entire circle of stories around him has flourished
 sanskrit kii sarvaadhik lokapriy do katha-shrinkhlaayein hai vetal panchavinshati yaa vetaal pachchisi or singhaasana-dvatrinshika 
 Many conversions of these two are found in Sanskrit and regional languages
 pishaach kii kahaniyon main vetaal, pachchis kahaniyaan sunaata he, jisamen raja vetaal ko bandi bananaa chahta he or vah raja ko uljhan paidaa karne vaali kahaniyaan sunaata he or unka ant raja ke samaksh ek prashn rakhte hue karata he
 In fact, first a monk begs the king to bring him to Betal without uttering a word, or else Betal will fly back to his place
 The king could remain silent only when he did not know the answer, otherwise the king would be beheaded
 Unfortunately, the king realizes that they know the answer to all his questions; That is why till the last question confusing Vikramaditya, the process of capturing Betal and then leaving him goes on twenty-four times
 in kahaniyon kaa ek roopantaran katha-saritsagar main dekha ja saktaa he
 The accounts of the throne are linked to the throne of Vikramaditya which was lost and was recovered by Bhoja, the Paramara king of Dhar several centuries later
 swayan raja bhoj bhi kaafii prasiddh the or kahaniyon kii yah shrinkhalaa unke singhaasana par baithne ke prayaason ke bare main he
 This throne had 32 effigies which could speak and challenged the king that the king could only sit on the throne if he was as liberal as Vikramaditya in the story he heard
 isse vikramaditya kii 32 koshishen saamne aati hai or har baar bhoj apni hinata sweekaar karte hai
 Finally the effigies are pleased with his modesty and allow him to sit on the throne
 shani se sambandhit vikramaditya kii kahani ko aksar karnataka rajya ke yakshagan main prastut kiya jaataa he
 According to the story, Vikram was celebrating the festival of Navratri with great pomp and debate on one planet daily
 antim din kii bahes shani ke bare main thi
 The Brahmin explained his greatness including the powers of Shani and his role in maintaining the religion on earth
 samaaroh main brahman ne ye bhi kaha ki vikram kii janm kundali ke anusaar unke barahawein ghar main shani kaa pravesh he, jise sabase kharaab mana jaataa he
 But Vikram was not satisfied; He saw Shani merely as a Lokkantak, who had troubled his father, Guru
 isliye vikram ne kaha ki ve shani ko puja ke yogya maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 Vikram was very proud of his powers, especially being the kind character of his late mother
 jab unhone navaratri samaaroh kii sabha ke saamne shani kii puja ko asweekrut kar diya, to shani bhagwaan krodhit ho gaye
 He challenged Vikram that he would force Vikram to perform his puja
 jaise hi shani akaash main antardhan ho gaye, vikram ne kaha ki yah unki khushkismati he or kisi bhi chunauti kaa saamana karne ke liye unke paas sabakaa aashirwad he
 Vikram concluded that perhaps what the Brahmin had said about his horoscope should be true; But they were not ready to accept the greatness of Shani
 vikram ne nishchaypurvak kaha ki "jo kuch hona he, vah hokar rahegaa or jo kuch nahin hona he, vah nahin hoga" or unhone kaha ki ve shani kii chunauti ko sweekaar karte hai
 One day a horse seller came to his palace and said that there is no one to buy his horse in the kingdom of Vikram
 ghode main adbhut visheshtaayen thim - jo ek chalaang main aasmaan par, to duusare main dharti par pahunchataa tha
 Thus anyone can fly or ride on earth
 vikram ko us par vishwaas nahin hua, isiilie unhone kaha ki ghode kii qeemat chukaane se pehle ve sawari karke dekhenge
 vikreta iske liye maan gaya or vikram ghode par baithe or ghode ko daudaya
 vikreta ke kahe anusaar, ghoda unhen aasmaan main le gaya
 In the second jump, the horse should have come to earth, but he did not do so
 iske bajaay usne vikram ko kuch dur chalaaya or jangal main phenk diya
 Vikram was injured and tried to find a way back
 unhone kaha ki yah sab unka naseeb he, iske alaava or kuch nahin ho saktaa; ve ghode ke vikreta ke rup main shani ko pahchaanane main asafal rahe
 As they were trying to find their way into the forest, a group of bandits attacked them
 unhone unke saare gahane lut liye or unhen khub peeta
 vikram tab bhi haalat se vichlit hue bina kehane lage ki daakuon ne sirf unka mukut hi to liya he, unka sir to nahin
 While walking, they reached the banks of a river for water
 zamin kii phislan ne unhen pani main pahunchaaya or tej bahaav ne unhen kaafii dur ghasita
 Somehow Vikram slowly reached a city and sat under a tree hungry
 jis ped ke neeche vikram baithe hue the, thik uske saamne ek kanjus dukandaar kii dukaan thi
 From the day Vikram sat under that tree, sales in the shop increased a lot
 laalach main dukandaar ne sochaa ki dukaan ke baahar is vyakti ke hone se itane adhik paison kii kamai hoti he or usne vikram ko ghar par aamantrit karne or bhojan dene kaa nirnay liya
 In the hope of prolonging the sales, he asked his daughter to marry Vikram
 After the meal, while Vikram was sleeping in the room, the daughter entered the room
 vah bistar ke paas vikram ke jaagane kii pratiksha karne lagi
 Gradually, he also started sleeping
 usne apane gahane utaar die or unhen ek battakh ke chitra ke saath lagi keel par lataka diya
 she fell asleep
 jaagane par vikram ne dekha ki chitra kaa battakh uske gahane nigal rahaa he
 While recalling the scene he saw, the shopkeeper's daughter woke up and saw that her jewelry was missing
 usne apane pita ko bulaayaa or kaha ki vah chor he
 Vikram was taken to the king there
 raja ne nirnay liya ki vikram ke haath or pair kaat kar unhen registan main chhod diya jaae
 jab vikram registan main chalane main asamarth or koon se lathpath ho gaye, tabhi ujjain main apane maayke se sasuraal laut rahi ek mahila ne unhen dekha or pahchaan liya
 He inquired about his condition and said that the Ujjain residents are very worried about his disappearance after horse riding
 vah apane sasuraal waalon se unhen apane ghar main jagah dene kaa anurodh karti he or ve unhen apane ghar main rakh lete hai
 His family belonged to the working class; Vikram asks for some work from them
 ve kehete hai ki ve kheton main nigaraanee karenge or haank lagaayenge taaki bail anaaj ko alag karte hue chakkar lagaaein
 ve hameshaa ke liye keval mehmaan ban kar hi nahin rahanaa chaahate hai
 One evening while Vikram was working, the candle is extinguished by the wind
 ve deepak raag gaate hai or mombatti jalaate hai
 This causes the candles of the entire city to burn - the princess of the city promised that she would marry a person who would be able to light a candle by singing a lamp melody
 vah sangeet ke strot ke rup main us viklang aadmi ko dekh kar chakit ho jaati he, lekin phir bhi usee se shaadi karne kaa faisla karti he
 When Raja sees Vikram, he becomes enraged by remembering that he was accused of theft earlier and now he is trying to marry his daughter
 ve vikram kaa sir kaatane ke liye apni talwaar nikaal lete hai
 At that time Vikram realizes that all this is happening to him due to the powers of Saturn
 apni maut se pehle ve shani se prarthana karte hai
 They admit their mistakes and agree that they had a lot of pride due to their status
 shani prakat hote hai or unhen unke gahane, haath, pair or sab kuch waapas lautaate hai
 Vikram requests Shani not to give such suffering to the common man
 ve kehete hai ki un jaisaa majboot insaan bhale hi pidaa sah le, par saamaanya log sahan karne main sakasham nahin honge
 Shani agrees with them and says that they will not do so at all
 raja apane samraat ko pahchaan kar, unke samaksh samarpan karte hai or apni putree kii shaadi unase karaane ke liye sahamat ho jate hai
 At the same time, the shopkeeper rushes to the palace and says that the duck has spilled the jewels back from his mouth
 vah bhi raja ko apni beti saunpta he
 Vikram returns to Ujjain and lives as a great emperor with the blessings of Shani

 EQUALS page 7 by Chloe Challender and Amy North Issue 15 navambar December 2005 articles available to subscribers chikitsa udyog main, nebuliser ek aisa upkaran he jiskaa upyog dawa ko fefdon main ek dhooma ke rup main pahunchane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD and other respiratory diseases
 jvalansheel dhumrapaan upkaran yaa kenabis joints ), ek veporiser, shushk powder inheler, yaa ek dabaav yukt maapi gayi khuraaq ke inheler kaa upyog bhi dawa ko saans ke zariye andar lene ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Nowadays flammable smoking devices and vaporizers are not used to inhale the drug, as modern inhalers and nebulizers are more effective
 sabhi nebulisers ke liye saamaanya takneekee siddhant ek hi he, jiske anusaar oxigen, sampidit vaayu yaa ultrasonic shakti kaa upyog dawa ke vilyan nilamban ko chote arosol buundon main milaane ke liye kiya jaataa he taaki upkaran ke mukh se sidhe is vilyan ko inhele kiya ja sake
 ek arosol kii paribhaasha he "gas or kan kaa ek mishran" or prakritik rup se paae jane vaale ek arosol kaa sabase acha udhaaharan "dhundh" he 
 jab sidhe fefdon tak dawa pahunchane ke liye inhelation therapy hetu nebuliser kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, yah dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki inhele kiye jane vaali sookshm boonden nichle vayumargon kii sankari shakhaon ko bhed kar unamem pravesh kar jaayen, agar unka vyas keval 1 se 5 micrometer tak hi he
 Otherwise they will be absorbed by the mouth cavity, which has less effect
 durbhaagya se vartmaan main uplabdh sabhi nebuliser choti buundon main arosol ko deliver karne main safal nahin hote hai, is kaaran ve dawa ko fefdon tak pahunchane ke liye paryaapt dakshata nahin rakhte hai
 The most commonly used nebulizers are jet nebulizers, also known as "automakers"
 jet nebuliser ko tub kii sahaayta se ek compressor se jod diya jaataa he, jiske kaaran sampidit vaayu yaa oxigen tej gati se ek taral dawa main se hokar pravaahit hoti he or ise ek arosol main badal detii he, jise ab rogi ke dwaara saans ke saath bheetar le liya jaataa he
 Nowadays physicians prefer a pressurized measured dose inhaler for their patients) rather than a jet nebulizer, the jet nebulizer produces more sound and is less portable due to its overweight
 haalanki jet nebuliser kaa upyog aamtaur par aspataal main un rogiyon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo inheler kaa upyog nahin kar pate, jaise saans ke rogon ke gambhir maamalon main or asthma ke gambhir maamle main
 jet nebuliser kaa mukhya laabh yah he ki iske parichaalan kii laagat kam aati he
 It is more expensive if a patient needs to inhale the medicine daily using a pmdi
 aaj kai nirmaataa jet nebuliser ke vajan ko 635 gram tak kam karne main kaamyaab ho gayi hai or isi liye is par ek portable upkaran kaa label lagaana shuru kar diya gaya he
 Compared to all competing inhalers and nebulizers, there is still the biggest drawback of noise and heavy weight jet nebulizers
 ultrasonic tarang nebuliser kaa avishkaar 1964 main ek nae adhik portable nebuliser ke rup main kiya gaya
 The technique in an ultrasonic Taran nebulizer is that it contains an electronic resistor that produces high-frequency ultrasonic waves, causing mechanical vibrations in a piezoelectric element
 yah compit hone vaala element ek taral ke bhandar ke sampark main rahata he or iskaa ucch aavruti kaa kampan vaashp kii ek dhundh ke nirmaan ke liye paryaapt hota he
 Chunky They manufacture aerosols from ultrasonic vibrations instead of heavy air compressors, weighing around 170 grams
 ek or laabh yah he ki ultrasonic kampan main naa ke baraabar dhwani utpann hoti he
 Examples of these more modern types of nebulizers are: Omron NE-U17 and Neural Nebulizer IH30
 nebuliser ke bazaar main ek or mahatvapurn navinikaran 2005 ke aasapaas hua, jab ultrasonic kampan mesh takanic ) kaa srijan hua
 In this technique, a mesh / membrane consisting of a 1000–7000 laser drill holes is vibrated on top of a liquid reservoir and very small droplets come out of the holes in the form of mist
 ek taral bhandar ke neeche ek pizoilactric element ko compit karne kii tulana main yah takanic adhik prabhavi he or isse upachaar main samay bhi kam lagata he
 a problem found in the ultrasonic wave nebulizer is that the liquid in it is very wasteful and heats up without wanting the medical fluid, this problem has also been solved with the vibration mesh nebulizer
 uplabdh VMT nebulisers kii aanshik suchi main shaamil hai: pari iflo, respironix ai-neb, omron microar, burar nebuliser IH50 or erogen aroneb 
 Since ultrasonic VMT nebulizers cost more than older models, most manufacturers also sell "old-fashioned" jet nebulizers
 nebuliser takanic main sabase haal hi hua navachaar he maanav dwaara sanchalit nebuliser jiskaa vikaas market vishvavidhyalay ke doctor lars i
 olsan ke dwaara kiya gaya
 In 1997, the medical company Boehringer Engelheim also invented a new device called Response Soft Mist Inhaler
 yah nai takanic upyogkarta ko ek maapi gayi khuraaq uplabdh karaati he, kyonki inheler ke taral aadhaar ko haath se 180 degree par dakshinavart disha main ghumaya jaataa he, jisase pratyasth taral paatr ke aasapaas spring main ek tanaav utpann ho jaataa he
 When the user activates the base of the inhaler, energy is released from the spring and exerts pressure on the vessel of the elastic liquid, allowing the liquid to move out of the 2 nozzles as a spray, thus creating a soft mist, called Is inhaled
 is upkaran main koi gas pranodak nahin hota or ise sanchalit karne ke liye kisi bydaree / power kii zarurat nahin hoti
is dhooma main sookshm boond kaa aakaar niraashajanak rup se 5
8 micrometer mapa gaya, jo inhele kii gayi dawa ke fefdon tak pahunchane kii prabhavi kshamta main kuch samasya ko ingit karata he
 Subsequent tests proved that this was not the case
 dhooma ke bahut kam veg ke kaaran, vastav main soft mist inheler kii prabhavita ek paaramparik pmdi kii tulana main adhik hoti he
 In 2000, some arguments were made for the European Respiratory Society to clarify / expand the definition of nebulizer, as the new Soft Mist Inhaler was described in technical terms as "one hand operated nebulizer" and "one hand operated Is categorized as both "pmdi"
 pehle "sanchalit" yaa dabaavayukt inheler kaa avishkaar frans main 1858 main cells-girons ke dwaara kiya gaya
 The device used pressure to convert liquid medicine into small particles
 pump ke handal ko cycle ke pump kii tarah sanchalit kiya jaataa he
 When the pump is pulled up, it draws the liquid from the reservoir and when applied by the user's hand, the liquid is applied through an atomizer, which can be sprayed near the user's mouth to inhale

 1864 main germany main pehle bhaap se sanchalit nebuliser kaa avishkaar kiya gaya
 This inhaler is known as the "seagull's Steam Spray Inhaler", which used Venturi's principle to atomize liquid medicine and was the earliest of nebulizer therapy
 choti boond ke aakaar ke mahatv ko abhi tak nahin samajha gaya tha, isliye is pehle upkaran kii prabhavakaarita kai chikitsa yogicon ke liye samajhi nahin gayi
 Seagull's steam spray consists of a spirit burner, which heats the water present in the reservoir and converts it into steam, the steam flows to the top and flows through a tube suspended in a therapeutic solution
 is maarg main bahati hui bhaap dawa ko vaashp main khinch leti he or rogi spray hone vaale is vaashp ko kaanch ke bane ek mukh se inhele kar letaa he
 The first electronic nebulizer was invented in 1930 and is called a pneumostat
 is upkaran main chikitsakeey taral ko electric compressor kii sahaayta se arosol main badal diya jaataa he
 As an alternative to expensive electronic nebulizers, however, in 1930 many continued to use the more simple and handheld nebulizer, known as the park-davis Glacéptic
 1956 main nebyulazars ke khilaaf ek pratispardhi takanic kii shuruyaat ricor leboratries ke dwaara kii gayi, ise ek dabaavayukt maapi hui khuraaq ke inheler ke rup main, shuru kiya gaya, iske pehle do utpaada the mediheler-iso or mediheler-api 
 in upkarnon main dawa thandi bhari hoti he or ise kuch vishesh maapne vaale valve ke madhyam se nishchit khuraaq ke rup main deliver kiya jaataa he, jise ek gas pranodak takanic ke dwaara khinchaa jaataa he 
 a new type of electronic nebulizer was introduced in 1964 as an "ultrasonic wave nebulizer"
 aaj nebuliser takanic kaa upyog keval chikitsa ke uddeshy ke liye hi nahin kiya jaataa he
 For example, ultrasonic wave nebulizers are also used in moisture-generating equipment, which aims to spray water aerosols to moisten dry air in buildings
 electronic cigarette main sambandh main, kuch pehle dizin kiye gaye modells main ek ultrasonic tarang nebuliser he jiske saath ek veporiser bhi sangyojan main hota he
 Although currently the most widely sold type of electronic cigarette, ultrasonic reduces the possibility of electing a wave nebulizer, as it has not been found to be effective enough for this type of device
 ab electronic cigarette ke bajaay electric veporiser kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, ise yaa to "andar upasthit atomiser" main avasorak saamagree ke saath sidhe sampark main prayukt kiya jaataa he, yaa "spreing jet atomiser" se sambandhit nebuliser takanic ke saath sangyojan main kiya jaataa he 
 Nebulizers take their medication as a liquid solution, which is often added to the device at the time of use
 corticosteroid or bronkodailator jaise salbutamol USAN) kaa upyog aksar kiya jaataa he or kabhi kabhi ipratropium ke saath sangyojan main upyog kiya jaataa he
 The reason these drugs are inhaled rather than eaten is that when inhaled, they work directly on the respiratory tract, causing the drug to perform its function faster and its side effects also work, when it is played
 They have more lateral effects
 aamtaur par arosol ke rup main badali gayi dawa ko ek tub jaise mukh se inhele kiya jaataa he, jo ek inheler ke samaan hota he
 Although masks are sometimes used in place of the mouth of the device, it is similar to the one used to inhale anesthetics, making it easier to use the inhaler in young children and in adults, However, if the patient can inhale the medicine directly from the mouth of the device, then it should be inhaled directly from the mouth instead of the mask, because less use of the mask reaches the lungs
 Fade, as it is swept across the nose
 corticosteroid ke upyog ke baad, saidhantik rup se yah sambhav he ki rogi ke munh main yeast kaa sankraman ho jaye yaa aawaaj main kharash paidaa ho jaye, haalanki vyavhaar main aisi sthitiyaan kabhi kabhi hi hoti hai
 To avoid these adverse effects, some physicians suggest that patients who use nebulizers should rinse thoroughly
 Although this is not true for bronchodilators, patients still want to rinse because the drugs that spread the respiratory tract have an unpleasant taste
 arosol kii buundon ke rup main fefdon main chikitsakeey taral ko pahunchane ke liye nebuliser ke upyog ke bajaay, inheler yaa veporiser kaa upyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
