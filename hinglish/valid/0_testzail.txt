 After the abolition of Rahim's education, Emperor Akbar, while following the tradition of his father Humayun, got Rahim married to Mahaban, sister of Mirza Aziz Koka, Bairam Khan's adversary

 Max Penn is one of the first video games to incorporate the famous "bullet Time" in its gameplay from The Matrix Triology, in which gunplay allows time to slow down to dodge bullets

 Max Penn is deeply influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Wu, as well as the harsh espionage novels of writers such as Mickey Spillane

 The player moves the story forward following Max's internal monologue, as he keeps repeating what the player's next move should be
 khel ke kai staron main pen ke yatharthparak-sankethik daraavne sapane tathaa nasha-sambandhi bhram shaamil hai
 Initially a 9mm semi-automatic pistol is the player's only weapon

 Some weapons in the game can be double-edged
 maiks khilaadi dwaara ikaitha kiye gaye dardanivaarakon kii sahaayta se swasthya laabh karata he
 The premise of this game is largely dependent on pre-written commands: most of the enemies' wise behaviors are pre-determined, such as taking cover, retreating from the player, or throwing grenades
 maiks pen kaa game play vyapak taur par dhimi gati ke ek rup bullate time ke aas-paas gumti he - jab bandook kaa ghoda dabaaya jaataa he to samay kii raftaar itani dhimi ho jaati he ki bullate kii harqaton ko khuli ankho se bhi dekha ja saktaa he or vah maiks ko vishesh yuddh kii mudraaen karne main sakasham banaata he
 Although the movements of the pen also slow down, the player is still able to position the target and react at the right time, taking unique advantage over enemies

 The enemies are not affected even if attacked in other ways
 Levels with more difficulties are extremely challenging; The "dead on Arrival" game mode binds the player to a limit of only seven defenses per chapter, and the "new York Minutes" mode forces the player to complete each chapter before the allotted time - eliminating enemies while they are exhausted

 As Balder is only aware of Max's secret identity, Penn loses his nypd's identity and the needle of the murder turns around
 iske alaava mafia ko yah pataa chal jaataa he ki vah police kaa aadmi he or uske naam kii supaari de di jaati he
 During further investigation and discovery of Lupino, Max raids a Valkyr drug deal and learns that Russian mobster Vladimir Lem is involved in a fight with Panshinello's men

 After shooting the crazy Lupino, Penn meets Mona Sachs, a female assassin who mixes Valkyr in his wine cup

 Max escapes from the clutches of the mafia and Vladimir joins a small group of lemons

 When Penn's eyes are killing Nicole Horn Mafioso, the ruthless CEO of the mysterious Esir Corporation, Max realizes that Don Valkyr is just a puppet in the market
 horn maiks ko walkir kii ek atirikt maatra kii sui laga detaa he or use marane ke liye chhod detaa he

 After recovering from an overdose of drugs and waking up, Penn sets out to fulfill his only objective, which leads him to a steel foundry atop a secret military research company

 The project was quickly halted due to poor results but was restarted by Horn and Essir
 He also learns that his wife came to know about the project by coincidence and that Horn had left the Valkir test-bound people in his house
 asir vaigyanikon sahit sabooton or gavaahon se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye bhumigat bunker kaa aatmghaatee "oparation ded aaiz" shuru karata he

 The BB tells that he killed Alex and that he implicated Max for his death

 After killing the traitor, Max receives a call from a man named Alfred Woden, who asks him to come to the Asgard building
 alfred apane-aapako "inner sarkal" naamak ek shaktishaalee gupt socity kaa ang bataata he, jiske sarkaar ke saath gahare tallukaat hai
 Members of the Inner Circle tell Max about Nicole Horn's identity and say that they could not chase him themselves due to "having their hands"
 ve maiks se horn ko maarane ko kehete hai, jiske badale ve uske viruddh lagaaye gaye kisi bhi aapraadhik aarope se use mukt kar sakate the
 Asgard is then attacked by the agents of Aesir and after killing him, he lays down Max and Woden and kills everyone in the meeting
 maiks lard kar apana rasta nikaalata he
 Max arrives at the Aesir Corporation's highly guarded high-tech security office and reaches the top of the building, avoiding an armed helicopter air strike
 vah punah lift main mona sex se miltaa he lekin maiks ko goli maarane se inkaar karne par uske sir par horn ke logon dwaara goli maar di jaati he
 When Max goes back to the elevator, his corpse has disappeared

 Max blows the building wires that break and falls on the helicopter and kills Horn

 The New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit arrives at the scene and arrests Max and brings him outside the building, where he finds Alfred Woden

 He kills hundreds of criminals and conspirators while evading police to stop his obsession with seeking revenge from those responsible for his family's death
 maiks ek bhole-bhaale ladke kii film noir kii paribhaasha he - ek aisa insaan jo apni marji ke khilaaf bure halaaton main funs jaataa he
 Max is very lonely and his sense of reality is very dramatic and stylistic
 vah ek antarmukhi he or apni harkaton, maahaul or paristhiti ke bare main apni bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karne ke liye arddh lakshanik aatm-kathanon kaa prayog karte hue apane gunon ko charam par le jaataa he

 unhone san 1916 main 19 varsh kii aayu main krantikari maarg main kadam rakhaa tha
 In the revolutionary life of 11 years, he wrote many books and published them himself
 un pustakon ko bechakar jo paisa mila usase unhone hathiyaar kharide or un hathiyaaron kaa upyog british raaj kaa virodh karne ke liye kiya

 barbai gram-vaasi aaye din angrezon va angrezi aadhipaty vaale gram-vaasiyon ko tang karte the
 Due to family feud, Narayan Lal left his ancestral village with his wife Vichitra Devi and two sons - Muralidhar and Kalyanmal
 unke gaanv chhodane ke baad barbai main keval unke do bhai - amaan singh va samaan singh hi rah gayi jinke vanshaj aaj bhi usee gaanv main rahete hai
 Today, a statue of Ram Prasad Bismil has been installed by the Madhya Pradesh government in a park in Barabai village
 vahiin 'barbai' gram ko 'saansad adarsh gram yojana 'ke tahat bhi viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, a temple of Bismil in Morena and 'amar Shaheed Pt Ramprasad Bismil Museum' has also been built at the district headquarters, which provides information about the immortal martyrs of Chambal region and historical and ancient sites of the region
 kaalaantar main yah parivaar uttar pradesh ke aitihaasik nagar shahjahanpur aa gaya
 Narayan Lal got a job at an attar shop located near the gate of Munnuganj in Shahjahanpur for just three rupees a month
 itane kam paise main unke parivaar kaa guzaaraa nahin hota tha
 Bismil's grandmother, Vichitra Devi, started grinding grains to get her husband's hand
 yah silsilaa lagbhag do-teen varshon tak chalata rahaa
 Local people often addressed him as "pandit ji" due to his ethics, honesty and religious tendencies
 isse unhen ek laabh yah bhi hota tha ki prayek teej - tyohaar par daan - dakshina va bhojan aadi ghar main aa jaaya karata
 Meanwhile, Narayan Lal got a job in a school with the help of local residents for seven rupees monthly
 kuch samay pashchaat unhone yah naukari bhi chhod di or rejgaari bechney kaa kaarobaar shuru kar diya
 With this, they started earning five-seven daily
 narayan laal ne rahane ke liye ek makaan bhi shahar ke khiranibagh mohalle main kharid liya or bade bete muralidhar kaa vivaah apane sasuraal waalon ke parivaar kii hi ek kanya moolmati se karke use is naye ghar main le aaye
 After marriage, Muralidhar got a job in Shahjahanpur municipality at a monthly salary of Rs 15
 kintu unhen yah naukari pasand nahin aayi
 a few days later, he quit his job and started selling stamp paper in the court
 is vyavsaay main unhone acha khaasaa dhan kamaaya
 Three bullock carts started running on rent and also started lending money on interest
 11 june 1897 ko uttar pradesh ke shahjahanpur shahar ke khiranibagh muhalle main janme ramprasad apane pita muralidhar or mata moolmati kii duusari santaan the
 Before them a son was born and died
 balak kii janm-kundalee va donon haath kii daso ungliyon main chakra ke nishaan dekhakar ek jyotishi ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi - "yadi is balak kaa jivan kisi prakaar bachaa rahaa, yadhyapi sambhaavna bahut kam he, to ise chakravarti samraat banane se duniya kii koi bhi takat roak nahin paayegi
 "both the parents were of Leo zodiac and the child also looked like a lion-cub, so astrologers thought very carefully and suggested the name of Libra sign
 mata-pita donon hi ram ke aradhak the atah balak kaa naam ramprasad rakhaa gaya
 Mother Moolmati always said that she wanted a son like Rama
 balak ko ghar main sabhi log pyaar se ram kahkar hi pukaarte the
 Before the birth of Ramprasad, his mother had lost a son, so the use of witchcraft was also taken
 ek khargosh laayaa gaya or navjaat shishu ke upar se utaar kar aangan main chhod diya gaya
 The rabbit made two or four rounds of the courtyard and died instantly
 iskaa ullekh ram prasad bismil ne apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 Muralidhar had a total of 9 children, including five daughters and four sons
 aage chalakar do putriyon evam do putron kaa bhi dehant ho gaya
 From childhood, special attention was paid to the education of Ramprasad
 uskaa man khilne main adhik kintu padhane main kam lagata tha
 Because of this his father used to beat him a lot, but mother always used to explain with love that "son Ram! This is a very bad thing, don't do it
" " is pyaar bhari sikh kaa uske man par kahin na kahin prabhaav avashya padataa
 His father first made the letter sense of Hindi, but neither did he learn to read an owl from u nor showed it by writing
 un dinon hindi kii varnmaala main u se ullu hi padhaayaa jaataa tha
 He was opposed to this and in return also ate his father's body
 haar kar use urdu ke skool main bhartee kara diya gaya
 Perhaps this natural quality can make Ramprasad a revolutionary
 lagbhag 14 varsh kii aayu main ramprasad ko apane pita kii sandukchi se rupee churaane kii lat pad gayi
 With the stolen money, he started reading by buying novels etc
 and also got used to smoking cigarettes and offering cannabis
 kul milakar rupee - chori kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa or ramprasad ab urdu ke premuras se paripurna upanyaason va gajalon kii pustaken padhane kaa aadi ho gaya tha
 Incidentally one day Ramprasad was caught stealing because of cannabis being drunk
 khub pitayee hui, upanyaas va anya kitaaben faad daali gayin lekin rupee churaane kii aadat nahin chhuti
 Later, when he understood a little, only then could he be free from this badness
 ramprasad ne urdu middle kii pariksha main uteern na hone par angreji padhanaa prarambh kiya
 At the same time, a priest of the neighborhood got Ramprasad knowledge of the method of worship
 pujari ek sulajhe hue vidwaan vyakti the
 His personality also had an impact on Ramprasad's life
 pujari ke upadeshon ke kaaran ramprasad puja-paath ke saath brahmacharya kaa paalan karne laga
 Ramprasad also started exercising after seeing the priest
 kishoravastha kii jitani bhi kubhaavnaayen evam buree aadaten man main thim ve bhi chhot gayin
 Cigarette smoking did not stop
 parantu vah bhi kuch dinon baad vidhyalay ke ek sahpaathee sushilchandra sen kii satsangati se chhot gayi
 After giving up cigarettes, Ramprasad's mind started studying
 bahut sheeghra hi vah angreji ke paanchaven darze main aa gaye
 There was an unexpected change in Ramprasad
 sharir sundar va balishtha ho gaya tha
 Time was spent in regular worship
 isi dauraan vah mandir main aane vaale munshi indrajit se uskaa sampark hua
 Munshi Indrajit told Ramprasad about the Arya Samaj and gave the book Satyarth Prakash written by Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 satyarth prakaash ke gambheer adhyayan se ramprasad ke jivan par ascharyajanak prabhaav padaa
 When Ramprasad was an eighth grade student at Government School Shahjahanpur, then by chance, Swami Somdev came to the Arya Samaj Bhavan
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko swamiji kii seva main niyukt kar diya
 It was here that changes in both the condition and direction of his life began
 ek ore satyarth prakaash kaa gambheer adhyayan va duusari ore swami somdev ke saath raajnneetik vishyon par khuli charchaa se unke man main desh-prem kii bhaavana jaagrit hui
 At the Congress session of 1916, when Ramprasad took out the procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire Lucknow city, while disguising the order of the late Pt
 adhiveshan ke dauraan unka parichay keshav baliram headgavar, somdev sharma va mukundilal aadi se hua
 Later these same Somdev Sharma along with some Siddhagopal Shukla also published a book from the Nagari Sahitya Library, Kanpur titled - History of American Independence
 yah pustak babu ganeshprasad ke prabandh se kurmi press, lakhanu main san 1916 main prakashit hui thi
 Ramprasad published this book from his mother with two hundred rupees in two times
 iskaa ullekh unhone apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 This book was confiscated as soon as it was printed and later when the Kakori case was prosecuted, this book was presented as evidence
 ab yah pustak sampadit karke sarfaroshi kii tamanna naamak granthavali ke bhaag-teen main sankalit kii ja chuki he or teen murti bhawan pustkaalay, nai-dilli sahit kai anya pustakaalayon main dekhi ja sakati he
 On hearing the news of the hanging of Bhai Parmanand in 1915, Ramprasad had pledged to destroy the British Empire, a book had come out in 1916, some young men had joined him, they had also received the blessings of Swami Somdev
 ek sanghathan unhone pan gendaalal dikshit ke maargdarshan main matruvedi ke naam se khud khadaa kar liya tha
 a commercial and a pledge were also published on behalf of this organization
 dal ke liye dhan ekatra karne ke uddeshy se ramprasad ne, jo ab tak 'bismil' ke naam se prasiddh ho chuke the, june 1918 main do tathaa sitambar 1918 main ek - kul milakar teen dakaiti bhi daaleen, jisase police satark hokar in yuvakon kii khoj main jagah-jagah chaape daal rahi thi
 In the Congress session held in front of the Red Fort in Delhi from 26 to 31 December 1918, the youth of this organization started selling books as they screamed that the police raided but all the books were saved due to Bismil's understanding
 pandit gendaalal dikshit kaa janm yamuna kinare sthit may gaanv main hua tha
 He was a teacher in the DAV school of Auraiya, a famous town in Etawah district
 deshbhakti kaa junun savaar hua to shivaji samiti ke naam se ek sanstha bana lee or hathiyaar ekatra karne shuru kar diye
 He was caught bringing weapons to Agra
 kile main kaid the vahaan se police ko chakma dekar rafuchakkar ho gayi
 After the merger of Bismil's maternal institution with the Shivaji Committee, the two worked together
 ek baar pun: pakade gayi, police peeche padi thi, bhaag kar dilli chale gayi jahaan unka praanant hua
 Bismil has given a very touching description of Pandit Gendalal ji in his autobiography
 mainpuri shadyantra main shahjahanpur se 6 yuvak shaamil hue the jinke leader ramprasad bismil the kintu ve police ke haath nahin aaye, tatkaal faraar ho gayi
 On 1 November 1919, Magistrate b s Chris pronounced the Mainpuri conspiracy
 jin-jin ko sajaayen huin unamem mukundilal ke alaava sabhi ko farvari 1920 main aam maafee ke elaan main chhod diya gaya
 Bismil remained underground for the entire 2 years
 unke dal ke hi kuch saathiyon ne shahjahanpur main jaakar yah afvaah failaa di ki bhai ramprasad to police kii goli se maare gayi jabaki sachai yah thi ki ve police muthbhed ke dauraan yamuna main chalaang lagaakar pani ke andar hi andar yogabhyas kii shakti se tairte hue milon dur aage jaakar nadi se baahar nikle or jahaan aajkal greater noida aabaad ho chukaa he vahaan ke nirjan bihadon main chale gayi
 There used to be only acacia trees in those days; And the man did not appear anywhere in the desert
 ram prasad bismil ne yahan ke ek chote se gaanv rampur jaagir main sharan lee or kai maheene yahan ke nirjan jangalon main ghoomte hue gaanv ke gujaron kii gaay bhens charaayi
 He has described this very interestingly in the second volume of his autobiography: Swadesh Prem
 yaheen rahakar unhone apana krantikari upanyaas bolshevikon kii karatuut likhaa
 In fact, this novel is originally a Hindi-translation of the book nihilist-rahasya written in Bangla language, whose language and style are both very interesting
 aravind ghosh kii ek ati uttam bangla pustak yogic saadhan kaa hindi - anuwaad bhi unhone bhumigat rahete hue hi kiya tha
 In those days, the land on the banks of Yamuna was considered safe to escape from the police, so Bismil made full use of that safe place
 vartmaan samay main yah gaanv chunki greater noida ke beta van sector ke antargat aata he at: uttar pradesh sarkaar ne rampur jaagir gaanv ke kshetra main aane vaali van vibhaag kii arakshit bhoomi par unki smriti main amar shahid pan ram prasad bismil udyaan viksit kar diya he jisaki dekharekh greater noida prashasan ke vitt-poshan se pradesh kaa van vibhaag karata he
 a feature of 'bismil' was also that they did not stay at any place for long
 kuch din rampur jaagir main rahakar apni sagi bahan shastri devi ke gaanv kosma jila mainpuri main bhi rahe
 Interestingly, even his own sister could not recognize him
 kosma se chalakar bah pahunche
 After a few days, then from Pinhat, Agra, went to his grandfather's village Barabai in the princely state of Gwalior
 unhone vahaan kisaan ke bhes main rahakar kuch dinon hal bhi chalaaya
 While living in exile, he translated the English book The Grandmother of Russian Revolution published in 1918 in Hindi
 unke sabhi saathiyon ko yah pustak bahut pasand aayi
 He named this book Catharine
 itnaa hi nahin, bismil ne sushilmala siries se kuch pustaken bhi prakashit kin thim jinamein man kii lahar naamak kavitaaon kaa sangrah, catherine yaa swadhinata kii devi - catherine brashkovsky kii sankshipt jeevani, swadeshi rang va uparokt bolshevikon kii karatuut naamak upanyaas pramukh the
 Apart from the indigenous color, all three books are available in the libraries for common readers nowadays

 In the business he earned both Naam and Naama
 congress jila samiti ne unhen lekha pareekshak ke pad par kaaryakari cameti main le liya
 In September 1920, he joined the Calcutta Congress as an authorized representative of the Shahjahanpur Congress Committee
 kalkatte main unki bhent lala lajpat raay se hui
 When Lala ji saw the books written by him, he was very impressed with them
 unhone unka parichay kalakatta ke kuch prakashkon se kara diya jinamein ek umadutt sharma bhi the, jinhone aage chalakar san 1922 main ram prasad bismil kii ek pustak catherine chhaapi thi
 At the Ahmedabad Congress Session of 1921, Ramprasad 'bismil' openly supported Maulana Hasrat Mohani on the proposal of Purna Swaraj and finally got Gandhiji to pass a resolution to start the non-cooperation Movement
 is kaaran ve yuvaaon main kaaphi lokapriy ho gayi
 The volunteers of Shahjahanpur played an important role in starting the non-cooperation movement throughout the country
 kintu 1922 main jab chaurichaura kand ke pashchaat kisi se paraamarsh kiye bina gandhi ji ne asahyog aandolan waapas le liya to 1922 kii gaya congress main bismil va unke saathiyon ne gandhi ji kaa aisa virodh kiya ki congress main phir do vichaardhaarayen ban gayin - ek udaaravaadi yaa libral or duusari vidrohi yaa rebelion
 Gandhi always used to call the young men of rebellious ideology in the Congress general meetings due to their opposition
 ek baar to unhone jawaharlal nehru ko patr likhakar krantikari navayuvakon kaa saath dene par buree tarah fatkaar bhi lagaayi thi
 In January 1923, wealthy people like Motilal Nehru and Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das formed a Swaraj Party
 navayuvakon ne tadarth party ke rup main revolutionari party kaa elaan kar diya
 In the special Congress session of Delhi held in September 1923, the disgruntled youths decided that they too would start interfering in politics by fixing their party's name and constitution etc
 Otherwise the loot system would dominate in the name of democracy in the country
 dekha jaye to us samay unki yah badi doordarshee soch thi
 The well-known revolutionary Lala Hardayal, who was working in those days to strategize to free India from abroad, was in contact with Ram Prasad Bismil since the time of Swami Somdev
 lala ji ne hi patr likhakar ram prasad bismil ko shachindranath sanyaal va yadu gopal mukherjee se milakar nayi party kaa samvidhan taiyaar karne kii salaah di thi
 Following the advice of Lala ji, Ram Prasad went to Allahabad and prepared the party's constitution at Shachindranath Sanyal's house
 navgathit party kaa naam sankshep main ech aar e rakhaa gaya va iskaa samvidhan pile rang ke parche par chhap karke sadasyon ko bheja gaya
 On 3 October 1924, an executive-meeting of this party was held in Kanpur, in which many prominent members of Shachindranath Sanyal, Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee and Ram Prasad Bismil etc
 attended
 is baithak main party kaa netritv bismil ko saunpkar sanyaal va chatarji bengal chale gayi
 Due to the difficulty of collecting funds for the party, the method of revolutionaries of Ireland was adopted and the first robbery was committed by the party in Bamrauli on 25 December 1924, which was efficiently led by Bismil
 iskaa ullekh chif court of avadh ke faisle main miltaa he
 Ram Prasad Bismil, in the 4-page pamphlet "the Revolutionary", published by the revolutionary party from an anonymous place on 1 January 1925 and distributed to all major places throughout India between 28 and 31 January 1925, under the pseudonym Vijay Kumar While disclosing in writing in writing the party's ideology, it was declared in clear terms that what kind of change in the governance system of this country's revolutionary Want to run and what can they do for it? Not only this, while mocking Gandhi's policies, he also asked why the person who calls himself spiritual is afraid to talk openly to the British
 He had given an open call to all the youth of India to join the revolutionary party by advising such pseudo-mahatma not to fall under the influence of the British

 Incidentally, Shachindra Nath Sanyal was arrested at Bankura when he was going to post this manifesto to a colleague
 isi prakaar yogeshchandra chatarji kanpur se party kii meeting karke jaise hi haavda stesan par train se utre ki ech aar e ke samvidhan kii dher sari pratiyon ke saath pakad liye gayi
 He was imprisoned in Hazaribagh jail
 donon pramukh netaaon ke giraftaar ho jane se ram prasad bismil ke kandhon par uttar pradesh ke saath-saath bengal ke krantikari sadasyon kaa uttardaayitv bhi aa gaya
 Bismil's nature was that he either did not take any work in hand and once he took the task in hand, he would not leave it without completing it
 party ke kaary hetu dhan kii aavashyaktaa pehle bhi thi kintu ab to or bhi adhik bad gayi thi
 Seeing that money was not received from anywhere, he committed two political dacoities on 7 March 1925 in Bichpuri and on 24 May 1925 in Dwarkapur
 parantu unhen unamem kuch vishesh dhan praapt nahin ho sakaa
 In these two robberies, one person was killed on the spot
 isse bismil kii aatma ko apaar ksht hua
 Finally, he made sure that he would now only loot the state treasury, not to rob the house of any of the nobles of India
 shahjahanpur main unke ghar par 7 agast 1925 ko hui ek immergency meeting main nirnay lekar yojana bani or 9 agast 1925 ko shahjahanpur railway stesan se bismil ke netritv main kul 10 log, jinamein ashfak ulla khan, rajendra lahidi, chandrasekhar aaazaad, shachindranath bakshi, manmathanath gupt, mukundi laal, keshav chakravarti, murari sharma tathaa banavaari laal shaamil the, 8 down saharanpur-lakhanu paisanger railgadee main savaar hue
 In addition to the pistols, all of them had four German-made Mauser pistols, with a butt in the butt that looked like a small automatic rifle and caused fear in the front
 in moujaron kii maarak kshamta bhi saadhaaran pistolon se adhik hoti thi
 In those days, these mausers were known like today's A-47 rifles
 lakhanu se pehle kakori railway stesan par ruk kar jaise hi gaadi aage badi, krantikariyon ne chen khinchakar use roak liya or guard ke dibbe se sarkari khajaane kaa baksaa neeche gira diya
 An attempt was made to open it but when it did not open, Ashfaq Ulla Khan grabbed his master Manmath Nath Gupt and took the hammer and broke the box
 manmathanath gupt ne utsukathavash moujar kaa trigar dabaa diya jisase chhuti goli ahamed ali naam ke musafir ko lag gayi
 He piled on the spot
 shighratavash chaandi ke sikkon va noton se bhare chamade ke thile chaadaron main baandhakar vahaan se bhaagane main ek chadar vahiin chhot gayi
 The next day this news spread through the newspapers through the whole world
 british sarkaar ne is train dakaiti ko gambheertha se liya or di ai ji ke sahaayak mistar aar e harton ke netritv main scotland kii sabase tej tarraar police ko isaki jaanch kaa kaam saunp diya
 The CID, after a serious investigation, confirmed to the government that the Kakori train robbery is a planned conspiracy by the revolutionaries
 police ne kakori kand ke sambandh main jaankaree dene va shadyantr main shaamil kisi bhi vyakti ko giraftaar karwaane ke liye inaam kii ghoshnaa ke vigyaapan sabhi pramukh sthanon par laga diye
 As a result of this, the police found that the sheet was found by someone from Shahjahanpur only because of the washer's mark on the sheet found at the scene
 shahjahanpur ke dhobiyon se poochne par maaloom hua ki chadar banarsi laal kii he
 The police obtained all the distinction by meeting Banarsi Lal
 yah bhi pataa chal gaya ki 9 agast 1925 ko shahjahanpur se uski party ke koun-koun log shahar se baahar gayi the or ve kab-kab waapas aaye? jab khufia taur se is baat kii pushti ho gayi ki ram prasad bismil, jo ech aar e kaa leader tha, us din shahar main nahin tha to 26 sitambar 1925 kii raat main bismil ke saath samooche hindustan se 40 se bhi adhik logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Only 10 people actually participated in the Kakori case, so all of them were nominated
 inamen se paanch - chandrasekhar aaazaad, murari sharma, keshav chakravarti, ashfak ulla khan va shacheendra nath bakshi ko chhodkar, jo police ke haath nahin aaye, shesh sabhi vyaktiyon par abhiyog chalaa or unhen 5 varsh kii kaid se lekar phaansi tak kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 Apart from the absconding accused, 16 of the revolutionaries who were arrested on suspicion of being active activists of H
R
A
 were released
 special magistrate anuddin ne prayek krantikari kii chhabi kharaab karne main koi kasar baaki nahin rakkhi
 Not only this, before sending the case to the sessions court, all the witnesses and evidence were collected so that even if an appeal is made, not a single accused should be released without conviction
 banarsi laal ko hawalat main hi police ne kadi sajaa kaa bhay dikhaakar tod liya
 In the Shahjahanpur District Congress Committee, this Banarasi had a fight with Bismil over the party fund
 bismil ne, jo us samay jila congress cameti ke auditor the, banarsi par party-fund main gaban kaa aarope siddh karte hue use congress party kii praathmik sadsyta se nilambit kar diya tha
 Later, when Gandhiji came to Shahjahanpur on 16 October 1920, Banarasi met him and made his stand
 gandhi ji ne us samay yah kahkar ki choti-moti hera-pheri ko itnaa tool nahin dena chaiye, in donon main sulah kara di
 But Banarsi was a very sly man
 usne pehle to bismil se maafee maang lee phir gandhi ji ko alag le jaakar unke kaan bhar diye ki ramprasad bada hi apradhi kism kaa vyakti he
 They neither believe anything about it nor allow anyone else to do it
 aage chalakar isi banarsi laal ne bismil se mitrataa kar lee or mithi-mithi baton se pehle unka vishwaas arjeet kiya or uske baad unke saath kapade ke vyapaar main saajheedaar ban gaya
 When Bismil formed his own party criticizing Gandhiji, Banarasi Lal was overjoyed and kept quiet in search of an opportunity
 police ne sthaneey logon se bismil va banarsi ke pichley jhagade kaa bhed jaanakar hi banarsi laal ko apruvar banaaya or bismil ke viruddh puure abhiyog main ek achook aujaar kii tarah istemaal kiya
 Banarasi Lal, being a partner in trade, knew such secret things related to the party, which no one but Bismil could have known
 iskaa ullekh ram prasad bismil ne apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 The 11 district barracks of the Lucknow District Jail, which was then called the Central Jail of the United Provinces, housed all the revolutionaries together and built a temporary court in a luxurious building called Ring Theater near Hazratganj intersection
 ring theatre naam kii yah building kothi hayaat baksh or mallika ahad mahal ke bich hua karti thi jisamen british afasar aakar film va naatak aadi dekhakar manoranjan kiya karte the
 In the same ring theater for 18 consecutive months, the British government spent 10 lakh rupees when the value of gold used to be 20 rupees in a historic trial in the name of King Imperial Versus Ram Prasad 'bismil' and Others
 british hukmaranon ke aadesh se yah building bhi baad main dhaha di gayi or uski jagah san 1929-1932 main ji pi o lakhanu ke naam se ek doosraa bhavy bhawan bana diya gaya
 When India became independent in 1947, the Nehru government completed the true task of installing a grand statue of Gandhiji here
 jab kendra main gaiyr congresi janata sarkaar kaa pehali baar gathan hua to us samay ke jivit krantikariyon ke samuhik prayaason se san 1977 main yojit kakori shahid ardhshtabdi samaaroh ke samay yahan par kakori stambh kaa anaavaran uttar pradesh ke rajyapal ganapatirav devrao tapaase ne kiya taaki us sthal kii smriti bani rahe
 In this landmark case, Harkarnanath Mishra was appointed as the lawyer of the revolutionaries from government expenditure, while Jagatnarayan 'mulla', a well-known lawyer in relation to Jawaharlal Nehru, was made a government lawyer under a thoughtful strategy
 jagat narayan ne apni ore se sabhi krantikariyon ko kadi se kadi sajaa dilwane main koi kasar baaki na rakkhi
 It was the same Jagat Narayan against whose will Bismil organized a grand procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire city of Lucknow in 1916
 isi baat se chidh kar mainpuri shadyantra main bhi inhen mullaji ne sarkari vakil kii haisiyat se kaaphi jor lagaaya parantu ve ram prasad bismil kaa ek bhi bal bankaa na kar paye kyonki mainpuri shadyantra main bismil faraar ho gayi the or do saal tak police ke haath hi na aaye
 On 6 April 1927, Special Sessions Judge A
 Hamilton, in a 115-page decision, considering the charges leveled against each revolutionary, wrote that this was not a simple train robbery, but a planned conspiracy to overthrow the British Empire
 haalaanki inamen se koi bhi abhiyukt apane vyaktigat laabh ke liye is yojana main shaamil nahin hua parantu chunki kisi ne bhi na to apane kiye par koi pashchaatap kiya he or na hi bhavishya main is prakaar kii gatividhiyon se swayan ko alag rakhane kaa vachan diya he atah jo bhi sajaa di gayi he soch samaj kar di gayi he or is haalat main usamen kisi bhi prakaar kii koi chhot nahin di ja sakati
 However, if any of these accused expresses remorse in writing and pledges not to do so in future, the Upper Court may consider their appeal
 faraar krantikariyon main ashfak ulla khan or shacheendra nath bakshi ko bahut baad main police giraftaar kar paayi
 An additional case of Kakori conspiracy was filed in the court of Special Judge J
 R
 Bennett and on 13 July 1927, Ashfaq Ullah Khan was hanged and sentenced to life imprisonment to Shachindranath Bakshi, repeating the same thing
 seshan jaj ke faisle ke khilaaf 18 july 1927 ko avadh chif court main apil daayar kii gayi
 Both cases appeared before the Chief Justice of the Chief Court, Sir Louis Schutt and Special Judge Mohammad Raza
 jagatnarayan 'mullah' ko sarkari paksh rakhane kaa kaam saunpa gaya jabaki sajayaftaa krantikariyon kii ore se ke si dutt, jayakarannath mishra va kripashankar hajela ne kramshah rajendra nath lahidi, thakur roshan singh va ashfak ulla khan kii pairvi kii
 Ram Prasad Bismil made his own defense because at the government expense he was given a big simple lawyer named Laxmishankar Mishra, which he refused to take
 bismil ne chif court ke saamne jab dharapravaah angreji main faisle ke khilaaf bahes kii to sarkari vakil mullah ji baglein jhaankate najar aaye
 On this reasoning ability of Bismil, Chief Justice Louis Shurtas had to ask him - "mr
 Ramprasad! From which university you have taken the degree of law?" At this he laughed and said- "excuse me sir! a kingmaker did not require Anne's degree
" " adaalat ne is jawaab se chidhkar bismil dwaara 18 july 1927 ko di gayi swayan vakaalat karne kii arji khaarij kar di
 He then presented a 76-page argumentative written debate
 use pard kar jajon ne yah shankaa vyakt kii ki yah bahes bismil ne swayan na likhakar kisi vidhivetta se likhvai he
 Ultimately, the court allowed the same Laxmishankar Mishra to argue, which Bismil refused to take
 kakori kand kaa mukadmaa lakhanu main chal rahaa tha
 Pandit Jagatnarayan Mulla was a poet of Urdu along with the government lawyer
 unhone abhiyukton ke liye "muljiman" kii jagah "mulajim" shabd bol diya
 What was it then, Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil' blatantly lashed out at him with a sarcasm: "don't tell me, mooljim, we are very sorry; we have brought it here with the help of the court
" palat dete hai ham mauje-hawadis apni jurrat se; ki hamane aandhiyon main bhi chiraag aksar jalaaye hai
 "he meant that he is not a servant, but a mullah who earns salaries from the government
 ve to raajnneetik bandi hai at: unke saath tameez se pesh aayen
 Along with this he also warned that they have the power to reverse even the waves of the sea with their audacity; What is the big deal to overturn the case? Who dared after speaking so much that would have stayed in front of Bismil
 mullah ji ko paseene chhot gayi or unhone kanni kaatane main hi bhalaai samajhi
 They quietly slipped through the back door
 phir us din unhone koi jirah nahin kii
 All the revolutionaries, except Shachindra Nath Sanyal, Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal, appealed in the Chief Court
 22 agast 1927 ko jo faisla sunaaya gaya uske anusaar ram prasad bismil, rajendra nath lahidi va ashfak ulla khan ko ai pi si kii dfa 121 va 120 ke antargat aaajeevan karawas tathaa 302 va 396 ke anusaar phaansi evam thakur roshan singh ko pehali do dfaaon main 5+5 = kul 10 varsh kii kadi kaid tathaa agali do dfaaon ke anusaar phaansi kaa hukum hua
 Shachindra Nath Sanyal, while in jail, had expressed his remorse in writing and had pledged not to take part in any future revolutionary action
 iske aadhaar par unki umr-kaid barkaraar rahi
 Shachindra's younger brothers Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal had confessed to their crime and had already given the undertaking to face any punishment of the court, so they did not appeal and the order for imprisonment of 5-5 years remained unchanged
 chif court main apil karne ke baavjood yogeshchandra chatarji, mukundi laal va govindcharan car kii sajaayen 10-10 varsh se badhaakar umr-kaid main badal di gayin
 The decorations of Suresh Chandra Bhattacharya and Vishnusharan Dublish also remained the same
 khubasurat handriting main likhakar apil dene ke kaaran keval pranavesh chatarji kii sajaa ko 5 varsh se ghataakar 4 varsh kar diya gaya
 Ramnath Pandey was the least punished in this case
 manmathanath gupt, jinaki goli se musafir maaraa gaya, kii sajaa 10 se badhaakar 14 varsh kar di gayi
 Since the cartridges of the Mauser pistol used in the Kakori case were purchased on the arms license of Premkrishna Khanna, due to sufficient evidence, Premkrishna Khanna was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 5 years
 chif court kaa faisla aate hi samooche desh main sansani fail gayi
 Thakur Manjit Singh Rathore informed the Central Legislative Council to submit a proposal to convert all the hanged prisoners of Kakori case to life imprisonment
 kauncil ke kai sadasyon ne sar wiliam moris ko, jo us samay sanyukt praant ke governor the, is aashay kaa ek prarthana-patr bhi diya kintu unhone use asweekaar kar diya
 78 members of the Central Council sent the then Viceroy and Governor General Edward Frederick Lindley Wood with a signed memorial in Shimla, prominently Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, NC Kelkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, Govind Vallabh Pant , Etc
 had signed but they had no effect on the Viceroy
 ant main madan mohan malviya ke netritv main paanch vyaktiyon kaa ek pratinidhi mandal shimla jaakar vysarai se mila or unase yah prarthana kii ki chunki in chaaro abhiyukton ne likhit rup main sarkaar ko yah vachan diya he ki ve bhavishya main is prakaar kii kisi bhi gatividhi main hissaa na lenge or unhone apane kiye par pashchaatap bhi prakat kiya he atah jajment par punarvichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The Chief Court in its decision also wrote this matter
 iske baavjood vysarai ne unhen saaf manaa kar diya
 Finally, barrister Mohan Lal Saxena prepared and sent the documents for clemency petition in the Privy Council to England's renowned lawyer SL Polak
 parantu landan ke nyaayadhishon va samraat ke vaidhanik salaahkaaron ne us par badi sakht daleel di ki is shadyantr kaa sutaradhar ram prasad bismil bada hi khatarnaak or peshewar apradhi he
 If he is granted pardon, he can commit a bigger and more terrible scandal in future
 us sthiti main sarkaar ko hindustan main shashan karnaa asambhav ho jaayegaa
 The result of all this was that the appeal for clemency sent to the Privy Council was also rejected
 16 disambar 1927 ko bismil ne apni aatmakatha kaa aakhri adhyay purna karke jail se baahar bhijwa diya
 Last met the parents on 18 December 1927 and on Monday 19 December 1927, they were hanged in the District Jail of Gorakhpur at 6

 The main gate of the jail was kept closed and Bismil's body was handed over to his family by breaking the wall in front of the gallows house
 shav ko dedh lakh logon ne juluus nikaal kar puure shahar main ghumaate hue rapti nadi ke kinare rajghat par uskaa antim sanskaar kar diya
 Stunned by this incident, Bhagat Singh wrote the pseudonym 'rebel' in the character of January 1928: "while carrying on the gallows you said very loudly - 'vande Mataram! Bharatmata ki Jai!' And walking in peace, he said - 'O master, you are the one who remains, and you are the one, and neither can i live or be my father; as long as your body lives in blood, your mention and your good will remain!' Standing on the gallows, you said - 'I wish the downfall of the British Empire! That is, i want the fall of the British Empire!' After this the lion said - 'now there are neither Ahle-valvle nor the crowd of arrogance, the desire to eradicate one is now in the heart! Then prayed to God and started reading a mantra
 rassi khinchi gayi
 Ramprasad ji hanged
 " At the end of his article Bhagat Singh writes - "today that hero is not in this world
 use angreji sarkaar ne apana sabase bada khufanaak dushman samajha
 The general thought was that he had become a huge threat to the government even after being born in the slave country and was very familiar with the science of fighting

 Hyder Ali's demise and Tipu Sultan's reign in the late 18th century is a major event in Mysore
 With the arrival of Tipu Sultan, the British imperialist policy reached a tremendous foundation, on the one hand, the company government was expanding its nascent British Empire
 On the other hand, Tipu, on the other hand, was determined to protect Mysore on the strength of his valor and diplomacy
 Thus, in the late 18th century, Tipu was a great ruler who tried to expel the British from India
 apane pita haidar ali ke pashchaat 1782 main tipu sultan mysore kii gaddi par baitha
 Like his father, he was a highly skilled commander and a clever diplomat
 That is why he always wanted to avenge the defeat of his father from the British, the British were quite afraid of him
 tipu kii akruti main angrejon ko nepolian kii tasviir dikhaai padati thi
 He was a master of many languages, he started taking administrative service and warfare in his father's time, but his greatest demerit was that he was a stubborn and arrogant person
 yahi durgun uske paraajay kaa kaaran bana vah francisiyon par bahut adhik bharosa karata tha or deshi raajaaon ki shaktiyon ko tukshya samajhataa tha vah apane pita ke samaan hi nirankush or svantrtaachari tha lekin phir bhi praja ke takalifon kaa use kaaphi dhyaan rahata tha
 Thus, the peasants were happy during his reign, he was not a religion despite being a staunch Muslim
 He looked at Hindus, Muslims with a single eye, was also a great reformer and tried to improve the direct field of governance
 uske charitra ke sambandh main vidwaanon ne kaaphi matbhed he
 Criticizing him, various British scholars have described him as tyrannical and righteous

 From the treaty of Mangalore, the drama of British Mysore war could not end, both sides did not consider this treat to be permanent, in 1786 AD Lord Cornwallis became the Governor General of India, he was not able to interfere in the internal affairs of the Indian states, but that Seeing the situation at the time, he had to intervene because at that time Tipu Sultan was his great enemy, so the British gave their Thiti Tipu this has the agreement with the regime to strengthen the person who wants to set up its head in both South hand for friendship Fransisio

 And so he wanted to establish friendship with great powers

 Critics say that Cornwallis was in a hurry to make the treaty and by not having the full residence of Tipu that if he had crushed Tipu's power, there would not have been a fourth Mysore War in the future, but in fact Carnavalis had not done his visionary
 At that time, the English army was sick and there was a possibility of war between England and France in Europe
 The Marathas and the Nizams would have started burning with it if the British had merged the entire state with the British, so the Carnavalis' aim was that the power of Tipu would be exhausted and at the same time the company's friends could not become powerful
 He attempted to crush Tipu's power without making his friends powerful

 Tipu Sultan's interest in the Sringeri temple continued for many years, and he continued to write letters to Shankaracharya even in the 1790s
 tipu ke yah patr tisare mysore yuddh ke baad likhe gaye the, jab tipu ko bandhakon ke rup main apane do beton dene sahit kai jhatkon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
