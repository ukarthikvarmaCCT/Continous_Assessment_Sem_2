 is mat ke upaask lingayat kehalaate hai
 The word is derived from the Kannada word lingwant
 ye log mukhyatah mahatma basavanna kii shikshaaon ke anugami hai
 The literal meaning of 'veerashaiva' is - 'one who is a supreme devotee of Shiva'
 kintu samay bitne ke saath virshaiv kaa tatvagyan darshan, sadhana, karmkand, saamaajik sanghatan, acharnium aadi anya sampradaayon se bhinn hote gaye
 Although Veerashaiva is also found in other parts of the country - Maharashtra, Andhra, Tamil region, etc
, Karnataka has the largest number of them
 shaiva log apane dharmik vishwaason or darshan kaa udgam vedon tathaa 28 shaivagamon se maanate hai
 Veerashaiva also does not show disbelief in the Vedas but in his philosophy, rituals and social reforms, such specialties have developed which are mainly derived from Shaivagams and such insight yogis who are known as 'vaadikars'
 12veen se 16 veen shatee ke bich lagbhag teen shatabdiyon main koi 300 vachanakaar hue hai jinamein se 30 striyaan rahi hai
 The most famous of these is Basava, who was the Prime Minister of the Jain king of Kalyan, Vizjal
 vah yogi mahatma hi na tha balki karmath sanghatankarta bhi tha jisane virshaiv sampradaay kii sthapana kii
 The goal of Vasava was to create a spiritual society in which caste, religion or women were not discriminated against
 vah karmkand sambandhi aadambar kaa virdohi tha or maansik pavitrataa evam bhakthi kii sachaai par bal detaa tha
 He was a supporter of the worship of only one God and tried to simplify the method of worship and meditation

 Veerashaiva is sometimes called 'sharan' or Shiva Sharan of Mahatmas, ie people who have given themselves to Shiva's refuge
 unki sadhana shivayog kehalaati he
 Veerashaivism is basically monotheistic philosophy but is essentially beyond divine action and meditation and the existence of the world in our real experience cannot be explained without desire and action, hence Shiva's theory of power was conceived
 ishwar se ekta sthapit karne ke liye aadhyatmik aakankshi apni ek yaa teenon shaktiyon kaa prayog karata he
 The name of the use of love power is bhakti yoga, the knowledge of the use of thinking power and the name of the use of karma power is karma yoga

 There is no doubt that the Veerashaivas also have temples, shrines, etc
 as in other sects, the difference being only between the deities who are worshiped
 jahaan tak virashaivon kaa sabandh he, devalayon yaa sadhana ke anya prakaaron kaa utana mahatv nahin he jitna isht ling kaa jisaki pratimaa sharir par dhaaran kii jaati he
 The spiritual master offers a favored penis to each Veerashaiva and bursts the sacred conspirator mantra 'om Nam Nam Shivaay' in his ear
 prayek virshaiv snanadi kar haath kii gadeli par isht ling kii pratimaa rakhkar chintan or dhyaan dwaara aradhana karata he
 Needless to say that every Veerashaiva is expected to possess high moral qualities like truthfulness, non-violence, fraternity
 vah niraamish bhoji hota he or sharaab aadi maadak vastuon se parhez karata he
 The summary of the directions issued by Basava in this regard is this - Do not steal, do not kill nor lie, do not praise or condemn others, treat all women other than your wife as mother
 veda, upanishad or shaivagam to sab sanskrit main he at: virshaiv vachanakaron ne unka saar or shaashvat satvon kaa sthoolansh kannada bhashaa evam sahitya main samavisht kar uski sambruddhi kii

 The Enron scandal, which was revealed in October 2001, eventually resulted in bankruptcy of an American energy company called Houston's Enron Corporation in Texas and one of the world's five largest audit and accounting partnership establishments, Arthur Anderson 
 In addition to being the largest bankrupt reorganization in American history at the time, Enron has undoubtedly achieved its biggest failure in the field of auditing
 enron kaa gathan hoston natural gas or internorth kaa vilay karne ke baad 1985 main kenneth le dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Many years later, when Geoffrey Skilling was hired, he created a team of executives who were able to hide millions of debt-ridden debt from failed deals and projects through the use of accounting flaws, special purpose entities and worse financial reporting

 Enron's stock price, which reached a peak of US $ 90 per share in mid-2000, fell to less than $ 1 by the end of November 2001, causing its shareholders to lose nearly $ 11 billion
 The US Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation and Dynegy was offered to buy the company at a fire sale price

 The act also increased the accountability of the audit establishments to remain objective and independent of their customers

 By 1992, Enron was the largest natural gas trader in North America, and the gas trading business became the second-largest contributor to Enron's net income, with a total of $ 122 billion in interest and tax-free income
 navambar 1999 main online vyapaarik model, enerononline, ke nirmaan ne company ko or aage badhane or apni vyapaarik vyavsaay par vaarta karne or iskaa prabandh karne kii isaki kshamta ko badhaane main is company ko sakasham bana diya
 In an effort to achieve further development, Enron pursued a diversification strategy
 By 2001, Enron had become a conglomerate that owned and operated gas pipelines, pulp and paper plants, broadband assets, power plants and water plants internationally
 is korporation ne isi tarah ke utpaadon or sevaaon ke vittiya bazaaron main bhi vyapaar kiya
 As a result, Enron's stock rose by 311% from the early 1990s until the end of 1998, a significant increase in the growth rate for the Standard and Poor 500 index

 In addition, its complex business model widened the accounting threshold, requiring the company to use accounting limits to revise the balance sheet to manage its earnings and to portray a favorable depiction of its performance

 "it seems, from the last phase of 1997 until its collapse, the main objective of Enron's accounting and financial transactions was to keep reported income and reported cash flowing, keep asset values high, and stay away from accountability

 Although business establishments such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch used conservative "agent models" to report revenue, Enron instead chose to report the entire value of each of its businesses as revenue
 lekhankan vyakhya main agent model kii apeksha is "vyapaaree model" drushtikon ko bahut zyada aakraamak mana jaataa tha
 Enron's method of reporting inflated business revenue was later adopted by other companies in the energy trading industry in an effort to remain competitive with the company's huge increase in revenue
 Other energy companies such as Duke Energy, Reliant Energy and Dynegy joined Enron in the top 50 of the Fortune 500 mainly due to revenue from their respective business operations

 However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting and cited that it would reflect "


 true economic value"
 Enron became the first non-financial company to use this method to keep track of its complex long-term contracts
 Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract is signed, the income was assumed to be the present value of net future cash flows

 However, in future years, profits could not be included, so new and additional income from more projects had to be included to develop additional growth to satisfy investors

 "despite the potential losses, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved this accounting method for Enron in the trading of natural gas in its future contracts on January 30, 1992
 However, Enron later met Wall Street estimates
 To help it expand its use in other areas of the company

 After several pilot projects, Enron identified an estimated profit of over 110 million from the deal, although analysts questioned the technical feasibility and market demand of its service
 When the network failed to work, Blockbuster terminated the contract
 Despite the losses from this deal, Enron continued to identify future profits

 ek ulanghan ke parinamswaroop, enron ke tulan patr main isaki dendariyon ko kam karke or isaki equity ko badhaakar or isaki aamadani ko badhaakar dikhaaya jaataa tha
 Enron told its shareholders that it defended the downside risk by using special purpose entities in its own fixed investments

 Notable examples of special purpose entities employed by Enron were - JD and Chuco, Whitewing and LJM

 In 1997, Skilling, who served as chief operating officer, asked calpers to join Enron in a separate investment
 calpers was interested in the idea, but only if he could be removed as a partner in the Jedi
 haalanki, enron apane tulan patr par jedy main calopers kii hissedari ko grahan karke kisi bhi rin ko pradarshit nahin karnaa chahta tha

 Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought Enron's $ 2 billion worth of assets, using Enron's stock as collateral
 Although the transaction was approved by the Enron board, the transfer of assets was not an actual sale and should be treated as a loan instead

 Skilling believed that if Enron employees continued to focus on costs, this would disrupt the original idea
 As a result, extravagant spending increased exponentially throughout the company, particularly among executives
 Employees had large expense accounts and many officers were sometimes paid twice as much as competitors

 Fastow told Fortune reporters that Enron could not disclose its income details because the company had more than 1,200 merchandise books of assorted items and "

 haalanki, chintaa badhati ja rahi thi
 Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, such as logistical difficulties in running a new broadband communications business unit, and losses from building a large power plant called the Dabhol Power Project in India
 The company's criticism was also increasing for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services played in California's power crisis in 2000–2001

 siio ke pad par pronnat hone se pehle skilling ne adhyaksh or sioo ke rup main ek lambe samay tak kaam kiya tha
 Skilling cited personal reasons behind leaving the company
 Observers commented that Skilling had sold at least 450,000 shares of Enron worth about $ 33 million in the months leading up to his departure
 Nevertheless, Lay, who served as Enron's president, convinced astounded market watchers that Skilling's departure would "not change the company's performance or outlook in the future"
 Le announced that he himself would once again take over as Chief Executive Officer

 After the September 11, 2001 attacks, media attention shifted from the company and its stakeholders; a few days to a month later, Enron announced its intention to start the process of reducing its low-dividend assets in favor of its core business, the gas and electricity business

 vaastaviktaa or uske nirupan ke bich kaa anupaat ko paimaana kehete hai
 It does not have a unit and is expressed as a fraction or a multiplier
 maanchitr par paimaana kaa arth he, maanchitr par darshaye gayi do binduon or unke sangat dharatleey jagahon ke bich duriyon kaa anupaat
 Template: This article needs to be spelled correctly maapak dharaatal ke kinhi do biduon ke bich kii vaastavik duuri tathaa maanchitr par darshit unheen do binduon ke bich kii duuri kaa anupaat he
 In simple words, it can be said that the ratio of the distance between the surface and the map is called a measure

 There are three methods of showing the scale on the map - kathanamak vadh Different viewer method iii) aalekhi yaa raikhik vidhi In this method, the scale is measured by speaking or saying words such as 1
 m = 1 meter or 1 inch = 2 miles, ie 1 cm on the map
 m a is equal to 1 meter of the far surface or 2 miles of 1 inch distance on the map
 yah sabase saral vadh he yak saadhaaran padhaa lakha yit bhi ise samaj kar dooray k gananaa kar saktaa he
 But the use of this method is limited, as this measurement can be read only in the country where the measure is run
 dashak bhan vadh :yah sanyaamak maapak he jasm maapak ek bhan ke pa m dashaya jaataa he
 The fraction of it cuts the distance of the map and the actual distance of each surface
 bhan ke ansh kaa maan hameshaa 1 ikai hota he jaise - ek maanach k dashak bhan 1 / 100, 000 he to maanach k ek ikai dharaatal k 100,000 ikai ke baraabar he
 This method has the maximum use because in any country from any decade there can be remote distances from the measurement system there
 aalekhi vadh : ise raikhak maapak bhi kehete ha
 In this, the unit is cut in a straight line by dividing it into primary and secondary part and writing unit number
 is maapni ke maanach ke vavadhan evam laghukaran yaa m maapak bhi vat: parwatat ho jaataa he
 The graphical scale consists of five types
 saadhaaran maapak tulanaamak maapak kanavat maapak vanayar maapak evam ay maapak
 In the method of measurement, mutual change is called the measurement of measurement which is done as follows
 kathanamak maapak ko dashan bhan m badalane ke lae savatham maanach va dharaatal k dooray ke anupaat ko ek ha ikai m badal kar ansh ko 1 ikai banaate ha tathaa ikai samaan hone par use dashak bhan m lakh dete ha jaise - 1se

 Therefore, decade = 1: 63000 1 inch = 1 mile 1 inch = 1 x 63360 inch

 Assuming in units, the denominator is written and converted into a larger unit of the same scale as 1: 100 by 1 cm

 Today, "game theory" is like an umbrella or 'unified field' theory for the logical side of social science in which 'social' is interpreted to include human as well as other players
 game theory ke paaramparik anuprayogon main in gemon main samyavasthaayen khojane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 In equilibrium, each player of the game adopts a policy that they might not change
 is vichaar ko samajhane ke liye samyavastha kii kai sari avadharanaen viksit kii gai hai 
 The motivation of these concepts of equilibrium varies and depends on the field in which they are being used, although their meanings are somewhat intermingled and harmonized
 yah paddati aalochana rahit nahin he or samyavastha kii vishesh avadharanaon kii upyuktata par, samyavasthaaon kii upyuktata par or aamtaur par ganitiya modelon kii upyogita par vaad-vivaad jari rahete hai
 Although there were already some developments in this area, the field of game theory came into being with John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern's 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior
 is siddhant kaa vikaas bade paimaane par 1950 ke dashak main kai vidwaanon dwaara kiya gaya
 Later game theory was explicitly used in biology in the 1970s, although it had begun only in the 1930s

 Eight Game Theorists have won the Nobel Prize in Economics, and John Maynard Smith has been awarded the Crowford Prize for experimentation in biology of game theory
 game theory main awalokit game spashtatya paribhaashit ganitiya 'objects'hote hai
 a game is made up of a set of players, a set of moves available to the players, and determining the benefit of each combination of policies
 adhikansh 'kooparative game' vishesh function form main nirupit kiye jate hai, jabaki ekstensive or normal form kaa prayog noncooparative gemon ko paribhaashit karne main hota he
 Extensive forms can be used to 'formalize' games with some important sequences
 isamen game aksar 'treez' ke rup main nirupit kiye jate hai yahaan prayek vartex ek khilaadi ke liye vikalp kii ek bindu darshata he
 The player is specified by a number listed by 'vertex'
 vartex se baahar nikali rekhaaen us khilaadi ke ek sambhavya kriya ko darshaati hai
 The benefits are specified at the bottom of the tree
 yahaan chitrit game main do khilaadi dikhaae gaye hai
 Player 1 first moves and chooses either f or U
 khilaadi 2 khilaadi 1kii chaal ko dekhtaa he or phir yaa to a yaa r chunata he 
 Suppose player 1 chooses u and then player 2 chooses A, then player 1 gets 8 and player 2 gets
 ekstensive form, vaise game jinamein donon chaalen ek saath nahin chali jaatin or aise game jiname jaankaree pakki nahin hoti, in do prakaar ke gemon kii bhi vyakhya kar saktaa he
 To represent this, different vertexes — to show them part of the same information set — are either joined by a dotted line, or a closed line is drawn between them
 normal aamtaur par ek metrics ke dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he jisamen khilaadi, chaalen or laabh ankit rahete hai 
 Generally this can be represented by a function that is associated with the benefit of all combinations of moves of each player
 saath main die gaye udhaaharan main do khilaadi hai; ek ro kaa chayan karata he or doosraa kollam kaa
 prayek khilaadi ke paas do ranneetiyaan hai jo ro or cholemon kii sankhya ke dwaara nirdisht kii gayi hai
 The benefits are given inside
 pehali sankhya ro vaale khilaadi ko praapt laabh he; duusari sankhya kollam vaale khilaadi ko praapt laabh he
 Suppose if player 1 moves up, player 2 moves left
 tab khilaadi 1 ko 4 laabh praapt hota he or khilaadi 2 ko 3 praapt hota he
 When a game is presented in normal form, it is assumed that each player plays simultaneously or is at least ignorant of the other's moves
 yadi khilaadiyon ko ek duusare ke vikalpon kii koi jaankaree hoti he to game ko aam taur par ekstensive form main prastut kiya jaataa he
 'cooperative' games with transferable utility do not offer any independent distinct benefits
 iske bajaay, kairactaristic function prayek gathbandhan ke liye laabh nirdhaarit karata he
 The standard assumption is that the empty alliance gains 0
 is form kaa praarambhik strot won neumann or morganstern kii aadharbhoot pustak se praapt hota he
 While studying coital normal form games, he assumed that when an alliance formed c { \ displaystyle C} C, it played against complementary coalitions as if they were playing a 2-player game
 c { \ displaystyle C} c kaa samyavastha laabh kairactaristic hota he
 Now there are different models for extracting coefficient values from normal form games, but not all games of characteristic form can be derived from normal form games
 niyamanusaar, ek kairactaristic function form game ek peyar { \ displaystyle } ke rup main nirupit kiya jaataa he jahaan n { \ displaystyle N} khilaadiyon ke ek set ko vyakt karata he or v : 2 n ⟶ r { \ displaystyle v:2^{n} \ longrightarrow \ mathbb {R} } ek kairactaristic function hota he
 The characteristic function form is generalized in games with no transferable utility routing
 kairactaristic function form 'coalishan' ke gathan ke sambhavya 'externalitiz' ko nazarandaz kar detaa he
 In partition function form, the benefit of 'coalition' depends not only on its members but also on how the other players are divided
 game theory kaa prayog maanav or pashu ke vividh vyavhaaron ke vistrut adhyayan main kiya gaya he
 It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including the behavior of companies, markets, and consumption theory
 saamaajik vigyaan main game theory kaa upyog or vistrut hua he or game theory raajnneetik, saamaajik or manovaigyanik vyavhaaron ke adhyayan main bhi prayukt hua he
 Game theory-based analysis was initially used by Ronald Fisher in the 1930s to study animal behavior
 yah kaam "game theory" ke naam ke aastitiv main aane se pehle kaa he, lekin isaki or game theory kii kai visheshtaayen samaan hai
 Its development in economics was later used in biology by John Menard Smith in his book Evolution and the Theory of Games
 vyavhaar ke anumaan or vyakhya ke alaava game theory kaa prayog naitik yaa maanak vyavhaar ke siddhanton ko viksit karne ke prayaas main bhi kiya gaya he
 In economics and philosophy, scholars have also used game theory to understand good or appropriate behavior
 agar ham peeche jaaen to dekh sakate he ki game theory aadhaarit is prakaar ke bhavarth ko plato ne bhi prastut kiya tha
 The use of game theory in political science focuses on the overlapping areas of fair division,]]]
 in kshetron main se prayek main, shodhakartaaon ne game theory aadhaarit modelon ko viksit kiya he jinamein khilaadi aksar matadaata, rajya, special interest group or raajnneetijna hote hai
 For early examples of game theory used in political science, see the work of Anthony Downs

 Economists have long been using game theory to analyze a wide range of economic facts, including auctions, bargains, duopoly, equitable division, oligopolies, the construction of social networks, and voting mechanisms
 yah anusandhan saamanytah ranneetiyon ke vishisht samucchyon par kendrit hota he, jinhen khelon main santulan kehete hai
 These "solution concepts" are generally based on the requirements of the rules of rationality
 gaiyr-sahakaari khelon main, naish santulan inamen se sabase prasiddh he
 If a set of strategies represents the best response to other strategies, it is Nash equilibrium
 isaliye yadi sabhi khilaadi apni chaalen naish santulan main chal rahe hai, to unke bich path se hatane ke liye koi ekatarfa pralobhan nahin hoga, chunki unki ranneeti sarvshereshth he, atah ve vah kar sakate hai, jo anya khilaadi kar rahe hon
 The profits of the game are usually taken to represent the individual game theory utility of the players
 adarsh sthitiyon main munaafaa aksar dhan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jo sambhawatah kisi vyakti kii upyogita se sambandhit hota he
 However this assumption may be flawed
 arthshaastra main game theory par ek pratimanaatmak shodhpatr kisi aise khel kii prastuti ke dwaara prarambh hota he, jo kisi vishisht aarthik sthiti kaa sankshepan ho
 One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which set of strategies are appropriately balanced in the presented game
 swaabhaavik rup se hamen yah aashcharya ho saktaa he ki is jaankaree kaa kya upyog kiya jaae
 Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses: descriptive and prescriptive
 pehla gyaat upyog is baat ko varnit karnaa he ki maanav aabaadi kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karti he
 Some scholars believe that by discovering game equilibria, they can predict how the actual human population will behave when confronted with situations similar to those described in the game being studied
 game theory kaa yah vishisht drushtikon naveenatam aalochana kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 First, it is criticized for noting that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated
 game theoricar yah maan sakate hai ki khilaadi apni vijayon ko pratyaksh rup se adhiktam str tak badhaane ke liye sadaiv ek hi prakaar se kaary karte hai, lekin vyavhaarik taur par, maanav swabhaav aksar is model se bhinn hota he
 There are many interpretations of this fact: irrationality, new models of deliberation, or even various motivators
 pratyuttar main game theoricar apni dharanaon kii tulana bhautik-shaastra main prayukt dharanaon ke saath karte hai
 Thus although their assumptions do not always prove true, they can use game theory as a scientific ideal similar to the patterns used by physicists
 haalaanki is game theory ke prayog par kuch atirikt aalochana bhi laadi jaati he kyonki kuch adhyayanon ne yah pradarshit kiya he ki vyakti santulan ranneetiyon kaa prayog nahin karte
 For example in the game of centipede, 2 / 3 of an average game is based on guessing and in dictator games people do not play regularly with Nash equilibria
 in adhyayanon ke mahatv ke sandarbh main bahes jari he
 Alternatively, some authors claim that Nash equilibria do not provide predictions for human populations, but rather explain why populations playing with Nash equilibria remain in that state
 haalaanki yah sawaal fir bhi khulaa rahata he ki aabaadiyaan us bindu tak kaise pahunchatin hai
 Some theorists have turned to evolutionary game theory to address their concerns
 ye pratimaan yaa to khilaadiyon ke liye koi taarkikta nahin maanate yaa paribaddh taarkikta maanate hai
 Despite its name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily consider natural selection in a biological sense
 vikasvaadi game theory jaivik or saath hi saanskrithik vikaas tathaa vyaktigem theory shiksha ke pratimaan donon ko shaamil karata he
 On the other hand, some scholars view game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of humans, but as a suggestion of how people should behave
 chunki kisi khel kaa ek naish santulan anya khilaadiyon kii game theory vidhiyon ke prati vyakti kii sarvshereshth pratikriya kaa nirmaan karata he, atah aisi chaal chalanaa upyukt prathit hota he, jo naish santulan kaa ek bhaag ho
 However, this experiment has also come under criticism for game theory
 sabase pehle, kuch maamalon main gaiyr-santulan ranneeti kaa prayog karnaa tab upyukt hota he, jab vyakti ko anya khilaadiyon dwaara bhi ek gaiyr-santulan ranneeti kaa prayog karne kii ummid ho
 For an example, see 2 / 3 estimate of average
 doosraa, qaidi kaa asamanjas ek anya sambhavit prati-udhaaharan prastut karata he
 Confused by the prisoner, each player trying to fulfill their selfishness brings both players in a bad situation, in which they would have stayed if they had not tried to fulfill their selfishness
 arthshaastra ke vipareet, jeevigyaan main khelon ke liye laabh kii vyakhya aksar yogyata ke sambandh main kii jaati he
 In addition, less attention has been focused on the balance of the idea of rationality and more on the equilibria that can be maintained by the evolutionary forces
 jeevigyaan main gyaat sarvshereshth santulan ko vikasvaadi sthir ranneeti ke rup main janaa jaataa he or ise sabase pehle main prastut kiya gaya tha
 Although its initial motivation did not include any mental requirement of Nash equilibrium, each ESS is a Nash equilibrium
 jeev vigyaan main game theory kaa upyog anek bhinn tathyon ko samajhane main kiya gaya he
 It was first used to explain the origin of the 1: 1 sex ratio
 ne yah suzav diya ki 1:1 ling anupaat un vyaktiyon par kaary kar rahi vikasvaadi shaktiyon kaa parinaam he, jinhen apane pautron kii sankhya ko adhiktam str tak badhaane kaa prayaas karne waalon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Additionally, biologists have used evolutionary game theory and ESS to explain the emergence of communication between animals
 sanket khelon or anya sampreshan khelon ke vishleshan ne pashuon ke bich sampreshan kii utpatti kii kuch jaankaree pradaan kii he
 For example, in many species of animals, in which a large number of predatory animals attack a large predator, the behavior of mass invasion appears to be an example of spontaneous organization
 kshetreeyata or ladaai ke vyavhaar kaa vishleshan karne ke liye jeev-vigyaniyon ne chuzon ke khel kaa prayog kiya he
 In a preface to the origins and theory of games, Maynard Smith writes, "incidentally, it has been found that game theory applies more to biology than to the field of economical behavior for which it was originally designed
 "
 vikasvaadi game theory kaa prayog prakruti main asangem theory prathit hone vaale anek tathyon kii vyakhya karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 One such fact is called biological altruism
 yah ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen ek jeev aisi paddati se kaary karata hua dikhaai detaa he, jo anya jeevon ke liye laabhadaayak or swayan uske liye ahitkar hoti he
 This differs from the traditional notion of altruism, because such actions are not conscious, but appear as evolutionary adaptations to increase gross worthiness
 iske udhaaharan pishaach chamagaadadon, jo raat ke shikaar se hasil kiye gayi khun ko ugalkar apane samooh ke un sadasyon ko de dete hai, jo shikaar kar paane main asafal rahe hon, se lekar karmi madhumakhiyon, jo aaajeevan rani madhumakhi kii seva karti hai or kabhi milan nahin karatin, se lekar varvet bandaron, jo samooh ke sadasyon ko shikari ke aagaman kii chetavanee dete hai, bhale hi isse unka swayan kaa jivan khatare main pad jaye, tak main paye ja sakate hai
 All of these tasks increase a group's overall worth, but an organism has to lose its life to do so
 vikasvaadi game theory is paropkaarita kii vyakhya sambandhiyon ke chayan ke vichaar ke rup main karata he
 The philanthropists make distinctions between the beings they help and they favor their relatives
 hamiltan kaa niyam is chayan ke peeche vikasvaadi tark kii vyakhya sutara c<b*r ke dwaara karata he, jahaan paropkaaree ko laganevaali laagem theory praptakarta ko milanevaale laabh va sambhddhata ke gunank ke gunanfal se kam honi chaiye
 The greater the proximity between the two organisms, the greater the incidence of altruism as they will have many of the same genetic elements
 iskaa arth yah he ki paropkaaree jeev, is baat ko sunishchit karte hue ki uske nikat sambandhiyon ke genetic tatv aage prasaarit hote hai,, swayan kii santan ko janm dene ke vikalp kaa tyaag kar saktaa he kyonki samaan sankhya main genetic tatv aage prasaarit hue hai
 For example, the coefficient of support for a sibling is 1 / 2 because the organism shares 1 / 2 genetic element in its sibling's offspring
 is baat ko sunishchit kar lenaa ki kisi sahodar kii santanon kii paryaapt sankhya vayask hone tak jivit rahati he, paropkaaree vyakti ke liye swayan kii santan utpann karne kii aavashyaktaa ko samaapt kar detaa he
 The coefficient values are highly dependent on the scope of the playground: for example, if the selection of those to be favored includes all genetic living objects, not just relatives, we assume that the difference between all humans is the playground
 Contains about 1% of the variation, the coefficient that was 1 / 2 in a small area becomes 0
995

 darshanashastra main game theory ke anek upyog hai
 In response to two papers presented by Harvard citations / core, Lewis used game theory to develop a philosophical understanding of the conference
 aisa karte hue, unhone saamaanya gyaan kaa praarambhik vishleshan pradaan kiya or taal-mail sambandhi khelon main khel ke vishleshan ke liye iskaa prayog kiya
 Additionally, he first suggested that one could understand meaning in the context of hint games
 louis ke baad anek darshanikon dwaara is suzav kaa prayog kiya gaya he ,saanchaa:harvard citations / core)

 Game theory also challenges philosophers to think in terms of interactive metaphysics: what similar beliefs or knowledge means to a group, and what effect this knowledge has on the social consequences of agents' interactions
 is kshetra main kaary karne vaale darshanikon main bicheri, skirms, tathaa stallnekar shaamil hai
 In ethics, some authors have attempted to follow the project of selfishness, initiated by Thomas Hobbes
 chunki qaidi kaa asamanjas naitikta or swaarth ke bich ek abhaasiya sangharsh ko prastut karata he, atah is baat kii vyakhya karnaa is pariyojna kaa ek mahatvapurn ghatak he ki swaarth ke liye sahakaarita kii aavashyaktaa kyon hoti he
 This general strategy is a component of the general social contract approach in political philosophy and see Kavka)

 These authors view various games including prisoner's dilemma, reindeer hunting, and Nash bargaining games as providing explanations for the emergence of an ethics approach

 a game is cooperative if players are able to make binding commitments
 udhaaharan ke liye kanoonee tantra unke liye apane vachanon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak banaata he
 This is not possible in non-cooperative games
 aksar aisa mana jaataa he ki sahakaari khelon main khilaadiyon ke bich samvaad kii anumati di jaati he, lekin gaiyr-sahakaari khelon main nahin
 This classification is rejected on the basis of two binary criteria
 khel ke do prakaaron main se, gaiyr-sahakaari khel sarvshereshth vivaranon tak paristhitiyon ke pradarshan main sakasham hote hai or sateek parinaam utpann karte hai
 Cooperative games are widely focused on sports
 in do margon ko jodne ke lakshaneey prayaas kiye gayi hai
 The so-called Nash-program has already established many cooperative conditions as non-cooperative equilibria
 sankarit khelon main sahakaari va gaiyr-sahakaari tatv hote hai
 For example, in cooperative games, players' alliances are formed, but they play in a non-cooperative style
 ek samamit khel aisa khel hota he, jisamen kisi vishisht ranneeti ke anusaar khilne kaa laabh keval anya prayukt ranneetiyon par nirbhar karata he, na ki unhen khelanewaalon par
 If the identity of the players can be changed without changing the profits from the strategies, the game is symmetrical
 saamanytah adhyayan kiye jane vaale 2 × 2 khelon main se anek samamit hote hai
 Chicken, prisoner's dilemma, and stag hunting prey are all symmetrical games
 kuch vidwaan in khelon ke udaahranon ke rup main vibhinn asamamit khelon par vichaar kar sakate hai
 However the most prevalent benefits for each of these games are symmetric
 sarvaadhik adhyayan kiye jane vaale asamamit khel ve khel hote hai, jinamein donon khilaadiyon ke liye ranneetiyon ke samaan samucchy nahin hote
 For example, Ultimate Game and Dictator Game have different strategies for each player
 haalaanki, yah bhi sambhav he ki kisi khel main donon khilaadiyon ke liye ek samaan ranneetiyaan hon or fir bhi vah asamamit ho
 For example, the game depicted on the right is asymmetric despite having the same set of strategies for both players
 shunya-raashi khel sthir-raashi khelon ke vishesh udhaaharan hai, jinamein khilaadiyon dwaara kiye gayi chayan uplabdh sansadhano ko na to badhaate hai or na hi ghataate hai
 In zero-sum games, for each combination of strategies, the sum of the total profits of all players in the game is zero
 pokar kaa khel ek shunya-raashi khel kaa udhaaharan prastut karata he kyonki koi bhi khilaadi thik utani hi raqam jeetta he, jitani uske pratidwandvi haarate hai
 Other zero-sum games include coin matching and most classical board games including Go and Chess
 game theorycaron dwaara jin khelon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he, unamem se adhikansh gaiyr-shunya-raashi khel hai kyonki unamem se kuch praptiyon ke sakal parinaam shunya se zyaada yaa kam hote hai
 Informally, in non-zero-sum games, the gain of one player is not necessarily associated with the loss of another player
 sthir-raashi khel chori or jue jaisi game theory vidhiyon se sambandhit hote hai, lekin us moolbhoot aarthik paristhiti se nahin, jisamen vyapaar se laabh sambhavit hote hai
 It is possible to convert any game into a zero-sum game by adding an additional fake player, whose losses compensate the player's net profit
 samakalik khel aise khel hote hai, jinamein donon khilaadi apni chaal ek saath chalate hai, yaa yadi ve ek saath chaal nahin chalate, to baad vaale khilaadi pehle khilne vaale khilaadiyon kii chaal se anbhigya hote hai 
 Sequential games are games in which players playing later have some knowledge of the preceding moves
 yah aavashyak rup se purvavarti khilaadiyon kii prayek game theory vidhi kii purna jaankaree nahin hoti; yah bahut thodi jaankaree ho sakati he
 For example, it is possible that a player knows that a preceding player did not perform a specific move, while he does not know which of the other moves the first player had made, among other available moves
 samakalik or aanukramik khelon main mukhya antar upar charchit vibhinn pradarshnon main sammilit kiye gayi hai
 Often, the general form is used to represent synchronized games and the broad form is used to represent sequential games; However, technically this is not a strict rule
 aanukramik khelon kaa ek mahatvapurn up-samucchy purna jaankaree se milakar bana hota he
 a game is full of information if all players are aware of the moves previously made by other players
 is prakaar, keval aanukramik khel hi purna jaankaree vaale ho sakate hai kyonki samakalik khelon main prayek khilaadi anya khilaadiyon kii chaalon ko nahin jaanata
 Most games studied in game theory are incomplete-information games, however, some interesting examples of full-information games, including the Ultimate Game and the Shatapada Game, are available
 purna-jaankaree vaale khelon main shatranj, go, mankala or arima shaamil hai
 Complete information is often understood as all information, which is a similar concept
 samast jaankaree ke liye prayek khilaadi ko anya khilaadiyon kii ranneetiyon va praptiyon kii jaankaree hona aavashyak he, lekin unki game theory vidhiyon kii jaankaree hona aavashyak nahin he
 Games studied by economists and real-world players generally end up with a limited number of moves
 shuddh ganitagya utane baadhya nahin hote or samucchy siddhantkaar vishishtatah un khelon kaa adhyayan karte hai, jo chaalon kii aseemit sankhya tak jari rahete hai or unamem vijeta un sabhi chaalon kii samaapti ke baad tak gyaat nahin hota
 Generally, the focus is not on what is the best method to play such games, but only on whether a player has a winning strategy
 
 The existence of such strategies has important implications in descriptive set theory for skillfully designed games
 game theory kaa adhikansh bhaag simit, asatat khelon se sambandhit hota he, jinamein khilaadiyon, chaalon, ghatnaon, parinaamon aadi kii sankhya simit hoti he
 However many concepts can be extended
 satat khel apane khilaadiyon ko ek satat ranneeti samucchy main se kisi ranneeti kaa chayan karne kii anumati dete hai
 For example, the cornet competition is typically designed in such a way that players' strategies are any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities
 antareey khel, jaise continyus percyut and evejan khel satat khel hai
 Individual game theory decision problems are sometimes considered "one-player games"
 haalaanki ye sthitiyaan khel saidhantik nahin hai, lekin unki rachana nirnay siddhant ke niyamon ke antargem theory unheen upkarnon main se anek kaa prayog karke kii jaati he
 Only when two or more players have a problem does the game become theoretical
 aksar betaratib bhang se khilne vaala koi khilaadi joda jaataa he, jo "avasarwaadi chaalen" chalata he, jinhen "swaabhaavik chaalon" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 In a two-player game, this player is not considered a third player, but instead plays a role of dice where necessary in the game
 khilaadiyon kii aseemit sankhya vaale khelon ko aksar n-vyakti khel kaha jaataa he
 These are the games that have to be developed to develop rules for any other game, goal or subject game

 The theory of metaphors is related to the methodology theory

 In this paper, Waldegrave provides a minimax mixed theory to solve the two-man version of the card game Le Hara
 james medicin ne uskaa nirmaan kiya, jise ab ham is baat ke khel-saidhantik vishleshan ke rup main jaanate hai ki kararopan ke vibhinn tantron ke antargem theory avasthaaon se kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karne kii apeksha kii ja sakati he
 No general game theoretic analysis was followed until Antony Augustine Cornut published the Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses in 1838
 is kaary main cornt ne ek dwayadhikaar par vichaar kiya he or ek samaadhaan prastut kiya he, jo naish santulan kaa ek simit sanskaran he
 Although Cornett's analysis is more general than Waldegrave's analysis, game theory had virtually no existence as a unique field before John von Neumann published a series of papers in 1928
 haalaanki francisi ganitagya emily borol ne khelon par kuch praarambhik kaary kiya, lekin won newman ko game theory kaa avishkaarak hone kaa shrey uchit rup se diya ja saktaa he
 Von Neumann was an intelligent mathematician whose work spread widely from aggregation theory to his calculations, which were the key to the development of both molecules and hydrogen bombs, and ultimately to the task of developing computers

 This intensive work involves methods to discover mutual congruence theory solutions for two-person zero-sum games
 is samyavadhi ke dauraan, game theory par kaary praathmik rup se sahakaari game theory par kendrit tha, jo vyaktiyon ke samooh ke liye yah maanate hue ishtatam ranneetiyon kaa vishleshan karata he ki ve upyukt ranneetiyon ke bare main apane bich sahmati lagu kar sakate hai
 In 1950, the prisoner's confusion appeared and an experiment was carried out on the game at RAND Corporation
 isi samay ke aas-paas, jon naish ne khilaadiyon kii ranneetiyon kii paraspar sangem theory ta ke liye ek maapdand viksit kiya, jise naish santulan ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jo won newman or morgenstem dwaara prastaavit maapdand kii tulana main khelon kii ek vyapak shrenee par lagu hota he
 This equilibrium is sufficiently general that it allows analysis of non-cooperative games in addition to cooperative games
 1950 ke dashak main game theory ne game theory vidhiyon kii ek halchal kaa anubhav kiya, jis samay ke dauraan mul, gahan swaroop ke khel, kaalpanik khel, doharaaye gayi khelon or shepale maan kii avadharanaen viksit huin
 Additionally, it was during this time that game theory was first applied in philosophy and political science
 1965 main, rinahard celton ne upakhel purna santulanon kii apni samaadhaan avadharana prastut kii, jisane naish santulan ko or adhik parishkrut kiya 
 In 1967, John Harsanyi developed the concepts of complete information and Bayesian games
 aarthik game theory main unke yogadan ke liye naish, celton or harsenyi 1994 main arthshaastra ke nobel puraskaar vijeta bane
 In the 1970s, game theory was deeply applied in biology, primarily as a result of the work of John Maynard Smith and his evolutionarily stable strategy
 iske atirikt sahasambaddha santulan, kaanpate haath kaa anubhav or saamaanya gyaan kii avadharanaen prastut kii gayi or unka vishleshan kiya gaya
 In 2005, game theorists Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann followed Nash, Selton and Harsanyi as Noble winners
 shelling ne game theory vikasshil pratimaanon par kaary kiya, jo vikasvaadi game theory ke praarambhik udhaaharan the
 Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium ideology by presenting an equilibrium rigidity, correlated equilibrium, and developing a more in-depth formal analysis of general knowledge and estimates of its effects

 Don is a 1978 Hindi crime thriller film

 Amitabh Bachchan, Zeenat Aman, Iftekhar, Pran, Helen, Om Shivpuri, Satyen Kappu and Pinchu Kapoor played the lead roles in the film
 kalyanji aanandji ne film main sangeet diya he, tathaa film ke geet anjaan or indivar ne likhe hai
 Amitabh Bachchan played the underworld boss 'don' in the film, and played the double role of his lookalike Vijay
 film kii kahani bombay kii jhuggiyon ke nivasee vijay ke ird-gird gumti he, jo sanyog se don kaa hamshakl hai
 DCP Silva of the Bombay Police asks Vijay to take the form of a don, so that he can act as the informer of the police, as well as help the police to crack the criminal network of the don
 'don' mumbai main ek anderworld apradhi he, jisaki talash mumbai police or interpol, donon ko he
 Dawn, who is included in Interpol's 'most Wanted' list of criminals, manages to escape by dodging the police every time
 apane nirdayee swabhaav ke kaaran, police ke atirikt don ke anya dushman bhi hai
 Mainly, Don once killed a colleague, Ramesh, after which his fiancée 'kamini' and sister 'roma' became enemies of Don
 kamini don ko bahakaane kii koshish karti he, taaki police aakar don ko pakad le, parantu don kamini ko bandhak banaakar vahaan se bhaag nikalne main safal hota he, or is puure ghatnakram main kamini kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Angry at the death of Kamini, Roma gets her hair cut, and learns Judo and Karate and joins Don's gang, so that he gets the chance to kill Don
 don ko pakadaney ke kai asafal prayatnon ke baad police ko akhirkaar safalataa praapt hoti he, or disipi di'silva don ko lagbhag pakad hi chuke hote hai, ki don kii mrityu ho jaati he, or don ke bos tak pahunchane kaa di'silva kaa sapana adhuraa hi rah jaataa he
 d'silva then bury the don right there

 DCP d'silva once meets Vijay, who reveals to him that Vijay is an enemy of Dawn, and asks Vijay to become Dawn, so that Vijay will inform the police, and d'silva is on his way
 Get to the bottom of the criminal network
 vijay unki baat maan letaa he, or don banakar waapas uski giroh ke paas chalaa jaataa he, jahaan vah apni yaaddasht kho jane kaa bahaanaa banaata he
 Meanwhile, Jasjeet is released from 'JJ' jail
 jasjit ko disipi di'silva ne hi giraftaar kiya tha; jis kaaran jeje kii patni kii mrityu ho gayi thi, or uske do bachche laapata ho gaye the
 His two children, Deepu and Munni were brought up in the meantime
 vijay don kii ek 'laal diary' le letaa he, or use lekar disipi di'silva se milane jaataa he
 Roma also accompanies her, and after finding her alone there she attacks him
 di'silva ain vakt par aakar roma ko vijay kii asaliyat bataate hai, or iske baad roma bhi vijay ke saath mil jaati he
 Vijay gives the diary to d'silva, and after reading it, he learns that Don's boss is named Vardhan, but no more information about him would have been written in that diary
 dhire dhire vijay ko don kebaare main or adhik jaankaree milti jaati he, or ek din roma kii sahaayta se vah ghoshnaa kar detaa he, ki uski yaaddasht waapas aa chuki he
 In this happiness, there is a party, in which the police raid falls
 is red main golibari main disipi di'silva buree tarah ghayal ho jate hai, or police vijay ko don samajhakar pakad leti he
 Vijay tells the truth to the people, after which the police take him to the hospital near DCP d'silva; But DCP d'silva dies before he can speak anything
