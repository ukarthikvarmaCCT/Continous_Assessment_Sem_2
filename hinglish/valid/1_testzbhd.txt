 chaahe guru-shishy sambandhen ke bahaane ho, chaahe avivaahit maatrutiv or vivaahit maatrutiv ke bahaane ho, chaahe dharm ke bahaane ho, chaahe chal-prapanch ke bahaane
 Even in war, there is the poetry of chanting towards the recognition of the superior qualities of man 'rashmirathi'
 ‘rashmirathi’ yah bhi sandesh detaa he ki janm-avaidhta se karm kii vaidhata nasht nahin hoti
 By his actions, a man takes another birth in his pre-death life
 antat moolyankan yogya manushya kaa moolyankan uske vansh se nahin, uske aacharan or karm se hi kiya janaa nyaaysangat he
 Dinkar has a voice for nationalism as well as Dalit liberation consciousness, Rashmirathi is the proof of this
 dinakar ke apane shabdon main, karn-charitra kaa uddhaar, ek tarah se nai maanavtaa kii sthapana kaa hi prayaas he
 Dinkar and Bachchan are among the unique achievements of the post-shadow era of Hindi
 hindi ke saamaanya pathakon main bhi dinakar kii ospurn kavitaaon ne nav ruchi or nav utsaah kaa sanchaar kiya
 The tone of his poems is of outrage against injustice
 samaaj main sansthagat ho chuke anyaay ke prati aakrosh kii abhivyakti ke liye dinakar ko aise nayak kii talash thi jo udaatt charitra-sampann hone ke atirikt anivarytah parakramee ho
 In the Karna of the Mahabharata, he finds a resemblance to the Manas envisaged hero
 mahabharat main swayan shrikrishna ke karn ke prati vyakt udgaar dhyatavya hai- Dinkar, who was delighted at the creation of the epic poem, was naturally overwhelmed by the personality of Tejaswi Karna
 yuyutsa or sangharsh karn ke vyaktitv ke abhinn ang the
 The adolescent struggle for Karna against the varna system, which prohibits individualism, starts from adolescence
 kishor karn ke andar ek mahaan yoddha hone kii sambhaavna bijrup main vidyaman thi
 a failed attempt to annihilate this possibility was to reject Karna as a disciple by Dronacharya
 parantu karn to marusthal kii vanaspati kii jijeevishaa lekar janma tha, jo ret se bhi ardrata sokh hi lete hai
 Kishore Karna resists the fraudulent play of monopoly on knowledge by keeping his real acquaintance in front of Parashuram
 kishor karn kaa yah ‘asaty’ prachlit vyavastha ke krur satya kii tulana main naganya tha, phir bhi karn shaap kaa bhaajan bana
 These ravages of personalities and personality violations are completely irrelevant to the present tense, so it does not matter
 haan, parivartan kii sugabugahat avashya dikhne lagi he
 In the words of Dinkar himself - 'A man ahead will be entitled only to the post which is informed by his power, not the post which is the gift of his parents or descendants
 isi prakaar vyakti apane nijee gunon ke kaaran jis pad kaa adhikari he vah bhi isamen koi baadha nahin daal sakenge
 The salvation of karna-charit is in a way an attempt to establish a new spirit
 ’ karn kaa dalit aatmgaurav yauvankaal main arjuna ko chunauti dene ke bahaane puri vyavastha ke jad pratimaanon ko chunauti detaa he - In the guise of Karna's ethnic introduction, when Kripacharya attempts to repress the tone of personal expression, Karna's accumulated anger erupts
 dinakar puure vishwa ko apane hriday main sametane vaali sahanubhuti ko adarsh maanate the
 Look at his words - "india's mind is less national, more international
 tab bhi, daastaa se mukti paane ke liye hamane rashtriya visheshan ko sweekaar kar liya, sirf is bhav se ki rashtriyata ke jaagran ke bina daastaa kaa ant asambhav he
 "the poet also does not want to accept the boundary of the nation and it is only natural for a great poet like that because expansion is life and contraction is death
" hriday ke vistaar se hi parpida kii samanubhuti kii kshamta manushya main aati he or tabhi vah pratyupakaar kii laalasaa kiye bagaiyr apana sarvasv bhi utsarg kar paata he
 The donation is a partial modification in the practice of this expansion
 dinakar kii drushti main daan karne kii kshamta udaatt charitra kaa sabase pramukh lakshan he
 This ability is found only among rare people in the world
 apni kshudh par vijay praapt karne vaala atmabali to he kintu dusron kii kshudhgni shant karne ke liye daan dene vaala adhik atmabali he
 Karna was one of such rare convictions
 devraj indra kii kapat manshaa ko bhaanp kar bhi unhen nizshank karne ke liye vah kahata he : This deliberate 'deceit' of Karna makes his character even brighter
 karn kii is veerta se indra kaa bhi hriday parivartit ho jaataa he or ve karn ko ekaghni dene ke liye vivash ho jate hai
 In the karna-kunti episode, Dinkar casts Karna as the neglected son
 mata kii kathor upeksha ke kaaran karn laanchhan bharaa abhishpt jivan jeene ke liye vivash ho jaataa he
 Therefore, in this context, her accumulated disturbance erupts on display of unexpected affection by the mother
 parantu karn to swabhaavatah hi udaaramana he jiskaa neh sab par he or jisaki dayaa sabake prati he
 Then how long could he be harsh towards Janani
 karn mitra-dharm ke nirvaah ke arth arjuna ko chhod shesh samast bhaaiyon ko yuddh main nahin maarane kaa vilakshan sankalp karata he
 In addition to charity, gratitude is also found in the best men
 swalp sahaayta bhi uchit samay par kiye jane par amuly ho jaati he, phir duryodhana ne to rangabhumi main vyangy ke tikshn baanon se hatprabh karn ko ubaarane ke liye use ang pradesh kaa raja hi ghoshit kar diya
 Karna refuses Kunti's request only because of being subjugated by gratitude and love for friend - kapati duryodhana kaa saath dene ke baavjood kadachit kritagyata kii kartavya bhaavana se prerit hone ke kaaran hi karn kaa vyaktitv kinchit bhi malin nahin hota
 Draupadi's rip off is one such incident where Karna's hurt pride does not allow her to express her voice of protest to protect the woman's identity
 dinakar ne karn-arjuna yuddh ke prasang main karn se pashchaatap vyakt karwaakar is kalank ko dhone kii koshish kii he
 If the episode of Draupadi Rip Haran is omitted, the character of Karna is completely flawless
 karn ke yuddh main senapati banane tak yuddh samast maryaadaaon ke atikaraman se vibhats swaroop gahan kar chukaa tha parantu karn punah maryaada kii sthapana karne kii koshish karata he
 When the serpent of Nagavansh rides on his horse Ashwassen, rejecting Arjuna's urge to laugh, he says - karn ne to adharm kaa aashray nahin liya parantu arjuna ne nitijna krishna kaa kaha sun avashya adharm kaa aashray le liya
 The wheel of Karna's chariot got stuck in Punk and Arjuna tied Karna with his arrows while disarming, removing the wheel
 karn ke jivan kaa surya is prakaar ast ho gaya parantu uski prabhaa kaa turya anant kaal tak samshti ko vyashti ke mahatmaya kaa aakhyaan karne ke liye bajataa rahegaa
 Through the salvation of Dinkar karna-charit, how successful he has been in establishing his desired life ie new life values

 agnyashay kasheruki jeevon kii pachan va antahsravi pranali kaa ek granthi ang he
 It is an endocrine gland that produces many essential hormones such as insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, as well as an exocrine gland containing pancreatic juice, which contains digestive enzymes that pass into the ileum
 ye kinvak amlann main carbohydrate, protein, va vasa kaa or bhanjan karte hai
 Under the microscope, two different types of parenchymal tissue are seen in the inflamed bite of the pancreas

 The pancreas is a two-function gland, with functions of both the endocrine gland and the exocrine gland
 antahsravi kriyakalapon vaala agnyashay main kuch 10 lakh koshika jhund hai jinhen ilats of lengrhans kehete hai
 There are four main types of cells in islets
 maanak daageekaran vidhiyon se inhen bhinnit karnaa thodaa kathin he, lekin inhen risaav ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he: α - alfaa koshikaaye glucagon, β beta koshikaaye insulin, δ delta koshikaaye somatostatin or peepi koshikaaye agnyashayi paulipeptid kaa risaav karti hai
 The islet is a dense set of endocrine cells that are held in flocks and cords and around them a dense network of cross-hatched capillaries
 ileton kii keshikaon main antahsravi koshikaon kii paraton kaa astr hota he jo vahiniyon se sidhe sampark main rahane ke liye cytoplasmi prakriyaaon yaa sidhe ekanvayan kaa prayog karata he
 According to Alan E
 Norse's body book, these islets "tirelessly build their hormones and usually ignore the surrounding pancreatic cells, as if they are in a completely different part of the body
 " When the endocrine pancreas leaks hormones into the blood, the exocrine pancreas produces a digestive fermenter and an alkaline liquid pancreatic juice in response to the hormones secretion and cholistocyanin and leaks into the pancreas via the exocrine vessel
 pachak kinvakon main tripsin, chimotripsin, agnyashayi lypes va agnyashayi emiles shaamil hai or inkaa utpaadan or risaav bahibasravi agnyashay kii gucchhik koshikaon dwaara hota he
 The lining of the pancreatic vessels is made up of certain cells, called centrocyanar cells, and they leak the rich solution of bicarbonate and salts into the ileum
 agnyashay niyamit rup se rakt main hormonon ke jariye va swachaalit snayutantr ke jariye niyamit rup se tantrika bharan praapt karata rahata he
 Both of these inputs control the leakage activities of the pancreas

 Each structure communicates with a vessel from the British
 udariy agnyashayi kali shir va ghumaavdaar prakriya banati he or yakrutiya chhidr se nikalati he
 Differential rotation and fusion of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds clearly creates the pancreas

 The cells of the pancreas differentiate through two distinct pathways, corresponding to the double functions of the pancreas - endocrine and exocrine

 Hearing this prayer of Brahma, Lord Vishnu said - "O Brahma! Go to Braj and take a mountain form in Vrishabhanupur
 parvat hone se vah sthaan varsha ritu main jalaadi se surakshitarahegaa, us parvataroop tumhaare sharir par main braj gopikaon ke saath anek lilaayen karunga or tum unhen pratyaksh dekh sakoge

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity exploration are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he

 islam dharm ke pramukh mat yah hai
 It is called Aqeedah: musalmaan ek hi ishwar ko maanate hai, jise wo allaah kehete hai
 Monotheism is called Tauheed in Arabic, which comes from the word vahid which means one
 islam main ishvar ko maanav kii samaj se upar samajha jaataa he
 Muslims have been asked to pray to God instead of imagining God
 musalamaanon ke anusaar ishvar adwitiya haih uske jaisaa or koi nahin
 a singular concept of God is emphasized in Islam
 saath main yah bhi mana jaataa ki uski puri kalpana manushya ke bas main nahin he
 Say: God is one more unique
 he ishwar sanathan, hameshaa se hameshaa tak jeene vaala
 He has no child, nor is he himself a child
 or us jaisaa koi or nahin
” According to Islam, from time to time, God made a person his messenger for the guidance of man on earth
 yah doot bhi manushya jati main se hote the or ishwar kii ore logon ko bulaate the
 God approached these messengers in various ways
 in ko islam main nabi kehete hai

 mohammad sahib bhi isi kadi kaa hissaa the
 The name of the religious book that was given to him is Quran
 quran main ishwar ke 25 anya nabiyon kaa varnan he
 According to the Quran itself, God has sent many more prophets to the earth besides these prophets, which are not mentioned in the Quran
 sabhi musalmaan ishwar dwaara bheje gayi sabhi nabiyon kii vaidhata sweenkar karte hai or adhiktam musalmaan mohammad sahab ko ishwar kaa antim nabi maanate hai
 The people of the Ahmadiyya community do not consider Muhammad Sahab as the last prophet and also call themselves a follower of Islam
 bharat ke ucchtam nyaayalay ke anusaar unako bharat main musalmaan mana jaataa he
 Many other eminent Muslim scholars have raised questions about Muhammad Sahab's last prophet from time to time
 musalamaanon ke liye ishwar dwaara rasulon ko pradaan kii gayi sabhi dharmik pustaken vaid hai
 According to Muslims, the Quran is the last religious book provided by God to man
 quran main chaar or pustakon kii charchaa he: Muslims understand that Christians and Jews have changed the context of their books
 vah in chaaron ke alaava anya dharmik pusatakon kii hone kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin karte hai
 Muslims believe in the existence of angels
 unke anusaar farishte swayan koi ichhashkti nahin rakhte or keval ishwar kii ajna kaa paalan hi karte hai
 They are abstract and innocent celebrities made of pure light, which are neither men nor women but different from humans in every respect
 haalanki agananeey farishte he par chaar farishte quran main prabhaav rakhte hai: Like other religions in Central Asia, Islam is also considered a day of doom
 iske anusaar ishwar ek din sansar ko samaapt karegaa
 Only God is aware of when this day will come
 ise musalmaan qayaamat kaa din kehete hai
 In Islam, there is a lot of emphasis on the resurrection of all physically dead people on that day
 us din har insaan ko uske achche or bure karmon kaa fal diya jayega
 Islam does not have the concept of time circularity like Hinduism
 qayaamat ke din ke baad dobaaraa sansar kii rachana nahin hogi
 Muslims believe in fate
 taqadir kaa matlab inke liye yah he ki ishwar beete hue samay, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bare main sab jaanata he
 Nothing can happen without his permission
 manushya ko apni man marazi se jeene kii azaadi to he par isaki anumati bhi ishwar hi ke dwaara use di gayi he

 Sugars influenza, also known as H1N1 or swine flu, is an infection spread by one of the various swine influenza viruses
 shookar influenza vishaanu, influenza kul ke vishaanuon kaa vah koi bhi upbhed he, jo ki siiron kii sthanikmaari ke liye uttaradaayi he
 SIV strains known as of 2009 include the subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2 and H2N3 of influenza c and influenza A
 is prakaar kaa influenza manushyon or pakshiyon par bhi prabhaav daalata he
 The swine influenza virus is common in suro worldwide
 is vishaanu kaa siiron se manushya main sancharan aam nahin he or hameshaa hi yah vishaanu maanav influenza kaa kaaran nahin banataa, aksar rakt main iske viruddh sirf pratipindon kaa utpaadan hi hota he
 If its transmission causes human influenza, then it is called zoonotic sugar influenza
 jo vyakti niyamit rup se siiron ke sampark main rahete he unhen is flu ke sankraman kaa jokhim adhik hota he
 If an infected pork is cooked properly, there is no risk of infection from its intake

 Since then only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed
 shookar influenza ke yah upbhed birle hi ek maanav se duusare maanav main sanchaarit hote hai
 Symptoms of zoonotic sugar influenza in humans are similar to those of common influenza, such as chills, fever, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, severe headache, weakness, and general discomfort
 siiron main influenza sankraman ke kaaran fever, susti, cheenk, khaansi, saans lene main kathinaayee or bhukh kii kami ho sakati he
 In some cases this infection can cause miscarriage
 haalanki aamtaur par mrityu sirf 1-4% maamalon main hi hoti he
 This infection can affect the pig's weight loss and growth, which can cause economic loss to their foster parents
 sankramit boar kaa vajan 3 se 4 saptaah kii avadhi ke dauraan 5 se 6 kilogram tak ghat saktaa he
 The main symptoms of swine influenza in humans are: - kuch maamalon main shookar influenza vishaanu kaa sancharan, siiron se sidhe manushyon main hona sambhav he, is sthiti main ise zunotic shookar influenza kaha jaataa he
 Since 1958, only 50 such cases have been reported, out of which only 6 persons have died
 in chah logon main se ek garbhvatee mahila thi, ek ko leukemia tha, ek hozkin rog kaa shikaar tha or do log pehle se swasth the
 Even though these direct cases may seem very rare, the true rate of actual infection may be much higher than this, as in most cases it appears to be a common disease and is therefore unreported
 maanav influenza ke liye uttaradaayi, teen vansho ke influenza vishaanuon main se do, siiron main bhi influenza failaa sakate hai, jisame se influenza e to bahut aam he par influenza si yada kada hi paaya jaataa he
 Influenza b has not yet been observed in pigs

 The influenza c virus infects both humans and pigs but does not infect birds
 ateet main bhi iskaa sancharan siiron or insaanon ke bich hua he
 For example, influenza c caused a less effective type of influenza spread among children in Japan and California
 apni simit parposhi range or anuvanshik vividhta kii kami ke kaaran influenza si maanav main mahamari kaa kaaran nahin ban paaya he
 Sucker influenza, subtypes of influenza a H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3
 Due to this
 puure vishwa main siiron main, teen influenza e vishaanu upaprakaar ech1en1, ech3en2 or ech1en2 sabase aam hai
 H1N1 came from Spanish Flu, an epidemic that spread during 1918 and 1919, killing approximately 50 million people
 jo virus spanish flu se aayaa vah siiron main vidyaman rahaa
 It also circulated in humans during the 20th century, although it occurs at the time of year when epidemics occur every year, making it difficult to distinguish between 'normal' influenza and sugar swine influenza
 haalanki suaron se manushyon main hone vaale sankraman ke maamle bahut viral hai or 2005 ke baad se america main 12 maamle paae gaye hai
 yahe == swine influenza in humans It spread to humans through swine

 rishta vipanan Relationship marketing was first defined as a predominant focus on sales transactions rather than on customer retention and satisfaction, a form of marketing developed from direct response marketing campaigns
 ek abhyaas ke rup main, rishta vipanan yah graahak sambandhon ke dirghakaalik mahatv ko pahachaanata he or dakhal dene se vigyaapan or bikri prachaar sandesh pare sanchaar faili hui he ki main vipanan ke anya roopon se alag he
 With the development of Internet and mobile forums, relationship marketing has continued to evolve and move forward as technology and collaborative and social communication channels opens
 yah saral janasankhyikeey or graahak seva ke data se pare chalaa jaataa he ki graahakon ke saath sambandhon ke prabandhan ke liye upkaran shaamil hai
 Relationship marketing extends to include inbound marketing efforts, public relations, social media and application development
 rishta vipanan kharidaar or vikreta donon ek adhik santoshjanak vinimay uplabdh karaane main ruchi rakhte hai, jahaan ek vyavastha ko darshata he
 This approach vaguely tries to transcend the simple post-purchase-exchange process with a customer to create more truthful and richer contact by providing a more holistic, personalized purchase, and uses experience to build stronger relationships 
 ham uphaar vinimay kii suvidhaon sahaayak ki vastu exange ke rup main sambandh vipanan siddhanton or vyavhaaron kii vyakhya kar sakate hai ek saamaajik maanavvigyaan ke nazariye se
 It seems that market-consciously or spontaneously knowing have begun to recognize and use the power inherent in 'pre' modern forms of exchange
 vipanan par is vishesh pariprekshya vipanan siddhant or vyavhaar bahut uphaar vinimay shaasi siddhanton kaa gaharaai se anusandhan se laabh uthaa sakate hai jahaan bhavishya ke anusandhan, ke liye upjau jameen ko kholta he
 According to Liam Alvi, relationship marketing can be applied when there are competitive product options for customers to choose from; And not when there is another ongoing periodic desire for the product or service
 companiyon ke liye yah adhik laabhadaayak graahakon kii janata ke liye apekshaakrit kam mulya ke utpaadon ko bechney ke liye mil gaya jaisi aadhunik upabhokta vipanan 1960 ke dashak or 1970 ke dashak main hua tha
 Decades of marketing scope of effort, having been one of these efforts have been made to broaden relationship marketing
 yakeenan, graahak mulya bahut in yogadan se samrudh kiya gaya he
 The practice of relationship marketing allows the tracking and analysis of each client's preferences, activities, tastes, likes, dislikes, and complaints that customer relationship management software has facilitated by several generations
 udhaaharan ke liye, kaise phir se graahakon ko apane utpaadon ko kharidne ke liye jab or ke ek database ko banaae rakhane ke ek motarvahan nirmaataa, ve chunaav ke vikalp hai, ve aadi kharid vitt tarah se, ek-se-ek vipanan pradaan karata he or utpaada laabh viksit karne ke liye ek shaktishaalee sthiti Relationship marketing has also been strongly influenced by restructuring
 punarrachana siddhant ke anusaar, sanghathanon purna kaaryon or prakriyaaon ke bajaay kaaryon ke anusaar sanrachit kiya janaa chahie
 That is, beginning to end cross-functional teams, rather than having the work go from one work department to another, one must be responsible for the entire process
 paaramparik vipanan kaaryaatmak vibhaag drushtikon kaa upyog karne ke liye kaha jaataa he
 The legacy of this can still be seen in the traditional fourp's marketing mix
 mulya nirdhaaran, utpaada prabandhan, padonnati, or placement
 According to Gordon, the marketing mix approach is also to provide a usable framework for assessing and developing customer relationships across multiple industries and focus on customers, relationships and interactions over time where alternative models of marketing Should be replaced by relation is limited, rather than market and products
 rishta vipanan keval maujuuda graahakon se aam taur par ek "opt main" pranali ke madhyam se graahakon se sampark ke liye anumati se jude ek parsparik rup se laabhprad aadan pradaan main sanchaar or upabhokta kii aavashyaktaaon ke adhigrahan par nirbhar karata he
 An important principle of relationship marketing
 This technique is now used as a means of balancing new customers and opportunities, through a mutually beneficial relationship, by satisfying customers' needs by satisfying the needs of those above competitive companies
 To ensure repeat business is the retention of customers through different means and practices
 Gains were maximized and at the expense of new customers
 Older direct marketing oriented businesses gained or lost older customers, with current and current customers as a means of countering the "leaky bucket theory of business" 
 "manthan" kii yah prakriya sabhi yaa nae graahakon ke madhyam se netritv peedi adhik nivesh kii aavashyaktaa ke rup main pratyaksh or sambandh prabandhan donon kaa upyog kar graahakon ke bahumat ko banaae rakhana he, kam se kam aarthik rup se vyavhaarya he
 Relationship marketing and traditional marketing are not mutually exclusive and there is no need for a conflict between them
 ek rishta unmukh bazaar ke abhi bhi sthiti char ke anusaar, abhyaas ke str par vikalp he
 Most companies mix the two approaches to match their portfolio of products and services
 lagbhag sabhi utpaadon unhen ek seva ghatak he or is seva ke ghatak haal ke dashakon main bada ho gaya he
 Relationship marketing also stresses what it calls internal marketing, or the use of a marketing orientation within the organization itself
 yah rishta vipanan ke kai "aantarik graahakon" kehete hai or kya karte hai nirdhaarit sahyog, nishtha or vishwaas kii tarah visheshtaon ki daawa kiya he
 According to this principle, every employee, team or department in the company is simultaneously a supplier and a customer of services and products
 ek karmchaaree mulya shrinkhalaa main ek bindu par ek seva praapt karata he or phir mulya shrinkhalaa ke saath aage kisi anya karmchaaree ke liye ek seva pradaan karata he
 If internal marketing is effective, every employee will both provide and receive exceptional service to and from other employees
 cranfild vishvavidhyalay se christopher, pyne or ballatin aage chalaa jaataa he
 They identify six markets which claim they are central to relationship marketing
 ve is prakaar hai: aantarik bazaar, aapurtikarta bazaaron main bhartee bazaaron, refral bazaaron, prabhaav bazaaron, or graahak bazaar
 Referral marketing is implementing a marketing plan to develop and encourage referrals
 aap refral vipanan ke prabhaav ko dekhne se pehle yah maheene kaa samay lag saktaa he, yah aksar ek samgr vipanan yojana kaa sabase prabhavi hissaa he or sansadhano kaa sabase acha upyog he

 The theory of balance of power assumes that a nation is more secure when the military capability is divided in such a way that no single state is so powerful that it alone suppresses other states
 shakti santulan kii avadharana lagbhag 15 veen shatabdi se antarrashtriya str main prachlit he
 Perhaps this is why some writers call it the basic principle of international politics, some call it the public principle or the fundamental principle of politics
 saadhaaran shabdon main shakti santulan kaa arth he jab ek rajya / rajyon kaa samooh duusare rajya / rajyon ke samooh ke saapeksh apni shakti itani badha le ki vah uske samakaksh ho jaae
 But there is no consensus on the definition of this notion
 shaayad isiilie innins el claude kaa kahana he ki yah aisi avadharana he jisaki paribhaasha kii samasya nahin he balki samasya yah he ki isaki bahut sari paribhaashaayen hai
 Before these definitions, it is also necessary to state that there are two types - simple and complex
 saral yaa saadhaaran shakti santulan jab hota he jab yah tulana do raashton yaa do raashton ke bich main sidhe taur par ho
 But if this equilibrium is between the mutual of two communities and also internally in the communities involved, then it is called complex balance
 iske sandarbh main vidwaanon ne vibhinn paribhaashaayen di hai jo is prakaar hai- Every nation aspires to gain more power than other nations to maintain or change the status quo
 iske parinamswaroop jis dhaanche kii aavashyaktaa hoti he vah shakti santulan kehalaata he
 The balance of power is some degree of stability or stability in equilibrium or international relations that can be achieved with the help of treaties or other means between states
 shakti santulan vah vyavastha he jiske antargat prayek rajya main yah vishwaas banaaye rakhane kaa satat praytn kiya jaataa he ki yadi rajya akraman kaa praytn karte hai to unhen ajey duusare rashtron ke samooh kaa pratirodh karnaa hoga
 The balance of power refers to a just system of power between members of the nation's families that prevents a nation from becoming so powerful that it does not impose its will on another nation
 is prakaar shakti santulan ko vidwaanon ne vibhinn dashshtiyon se dekha he
 Some see it as a distribution of power, some as an equilibrium between groups, some as stability, some as war and instability
 kehane kaa arth yah he ki in paribhaashaon main sarvasammati kaa abhaav he
 This is probably because there are many meanings / uses of balance of power, due to which this confusion has remained
 mukhya taur par shakti santulan ko chaar sandarbhon main prayog kiya jaataa he- According to Quincy Right, the principle of balance of power is based on five beliefs- shakti santulan kii nimnlikhit visheshtaayen hoti hai- In general it is a policy to maintain status quo, but in reality it is always dynamic and variable
 yah koi daivi vardaan nahin he, apitu yah maanav ke satat hastkshep kaa parinaam he
 It is defined both subjectively and objectively
 itihaaskaar hameshaa iskaa vastunishth akalan karte hai jabaki rajanyik hameshaa isaki vyaktiparak vivechna karte hai
 Although it is a mechanism for establishing peace, it rarely establishes peace
 yah mukhyatya mahashaktiyon kaa khel he
 Small nations only play the role of spectator
 iske sahi sanchaalan hetu ek sanchaalak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo aaj ke yug main nadaarad he
 It gives equal distribution of powers on the basis of equilibrium
 parantu yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko dekhne se gyaat hota he ki aisa samay kabhi nahin rahaa
 The system of balance of power is hardly visible in international politics, because it is not possible to measure and stabilize the element of power

com The following methods are used to establish the balance of power- kabhi-kabhi badi shaktiyaan chote rajyon kii bhoomi ko aapasi shakti santulan hetu baant leti hai
 This boundary change is done on the basis that none of the mutual powers become stronger than the other
 udhaaharan ke rup main, utract kii sandhi ke baad 1713 main spain kii bhoomi ko borbon va hepsburg ke bich baant diya gaya
 Similarly, Poland was divided into three times in such a way that the balance of power did not deteriorate
 isi prakaar 18veen va 19veen shatabdi main vibhinn sandhiyaan isi dashshtikon ko dhyaan main rakhkar huin
 Friendship treaties have also been a major means of balancing power
 lekin jab ek raashtra maitra sandhiyon ke dwaara apni shakti badha letaa he tab anya rajya bhi ashankit hokar aapas main prati maitra sandhiyaan karne lagate hai
 The end of this sequence is organized by all the nations of the world into opposing groups
 is prakaar kii maitra sandhiyon evam prati maitra sandhiyon kaa daur europe kii raajnneeti main aamtaur par dekhne ko milti he
 For example, in opposition to the formation of the 1882 Triennial Treaty, anti-trinitarian friendship treaties were also agreed among other nations to balance the politics of Europe
 isi prakaar ke udhaaharan dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad mahashaktiyon ke bich sthapit gathbandhanon ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Armament is the direct and foremost form of power
 isiilie rajyon ke madhya, visheshkar apane pratidwandvi se, shastron ko sanchay karne kii hode lag jaati he
 This accumulation develops their military power and serves to increase the pressure on their opponents
 parantu doosraa raashtra yaa rajyon kaa samooh bhi peeche nahin rahanaa chahta, atah donon hi ek duusare ko santulit karnaa chaahate hai
 For example, in the Cold War era, between the former Soviet Union and the United States, armament has been a means of both of them balancing each other
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti shastreekaran ke saath-saath nirastrikaran bhi kai baar shaktiyon ke madhya santulan banane kaa kaary karata he
 When the weaponization is not possible to proceed after a climax, then the powers move towards disarmament
 udhaaharan ke rup main, donon mahashaktiyon ke bich salt-1 salt-2 start-1 va start-2 ienef sandhi aadi samjhaute iskaa pramaan he
 This is evidence of the need to take measures to increase credibility in the present times, fed up with arms, among other nations
 kai baar do shaktiyaan aapasi sidhe takaraav ko taalkar kisi ek rajya ko madhya rakhkar aapasi santulan banaae rakhti hai
 Therefore, such a weak and neutral state always keeps the balance of power along with the possibility of war between the two big forces
 udhaaharan rup main, kaaphi samay tak poland rus va germany ke bich madhyavarti rajya bana rahaa
 This situation was prolonged between Afghanistan, Russia and England
 kabhi-kabhi do gaiyr mitra raashtra madhyavarti kshetra ko baraabar-baraabar baant lete hai
 In such a situation the effect of intermediate regions is minimized

 The policy of intervention is always to increase its influence by powerful nations interfering in the matter of another
 iskaa uddeshy bade raashtra dwaara vahaan par kisi shashan ke bane rahane yaa badalane ke swaroop main hota he
 Through this means, an effort is made to maintain the balance of power
 shityudh kaal main donon mahashaktiyon ne iskaa khub prayog kiya
 While the former Soviet Union intervened in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, the US has intervened in Grenada, Cuba, Nicaragua, Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc

 It has been adopted as a coastal state by smaller states

 Most of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin American countries have followed the policy of non-alignment by adopting a policy of non-alignment
 isse yuddh na karne yaa use simit rakhane yaa uske sthaneey swaroop dene kaa prayaas aadi isi ke antargat aa jate hai
 Divide by big forces in international politics, has also followed the policy of rule
 rajyon ko do virdohi guton main baant kar bhi shaktiyaan us kshetra main shakti santulan sthapit karti hai
 This policy was used quite often by Britain to keep its empire unified
 1947 kaa bharat-paak vibhaajan iskaa shashakt udhaaharan he
 Under this policy, efforts have been made to balance by weakening our rivals
 shityudh kaal main mahashaktiyon ne bhi gutnirpeksh deshon main is prakaar kii niti kaa anusaran kiya he
 If we evaluate the balance of power, then it becomes clear that in this way the absolute limits on power could not be imposed
 haa kuch had tak yah siddhanth apane uddeshyon main safal ho sakaa
 The following reasons for this theory not being able to completely curb the development of power - uparokt vichaaron se yah spasht he ki shakti vistaar yaa shakti sangharsh rokane hetu yah siddhanth purnroopen sakasham nahin he
 But it does get partial success through this, because - First, small states can assure their security
 dwitiya, yah kisi badi shakti ke aadhipaty sthapana par bhi ankush rakhega
 Third, it is also capable of avoiding wars
 chaturth, samprabhu rajyon par kisi kendriya satta ke abhaav main antarrashtriya kanoon bhi keval shakti santulan se hi sambhav he
 Therefore, it is able to partially block the possibilities of establishing autocratic or hegemonic power

 The galaxy is a spiral galaxy in shape, with a large center and several curved arms emanating from it
 hamaara saura mandal isaki shikari-hans bhujaa par sthit he
 There are between 100 billion and 400 billion stars in the galaxy and it is estimated that there will be about 50 billion planets, of which 500 million are at a distance from their stars to keep life-worthy temperatures
 san 2011 main hone vaale ek surveykshan main yah sambhaavna paayi gai ki is anumaan se adhik grah hon - is adhyayan ke anusaar akashganga main taron kii sankhya se dugane grah ho sakate hai
 Our solar system is located on the outskirts of the galaxy and is orbiting the center of the galaxy
 ise ek puri parikrama karne main lagbhag 22
5 se 25 karod varsh lag jate hai
 In Sanskrit and many other indo-aryan languages, our Galaxy is called "milky Way"
 puraanon main akashganga or prithvi par sthit ganga nadi ko ek dusre kaa joda mana jaataa tha or donon ko pavitra mana jaataa tha
 The galaxy has been called "kshir" in ancient Hindu religious texts
 bhartiya upmahadweep ke baahar bhi kai sabhyataaon ko akashganga dudhia lagi
 The word "galaxy" originates from the Greek word "gala", which also means milk
 farsi sanskrit kii hi tarah ek hind-irani bhashaa he, isliye uskaa "doodh" ke liye shabd sanskrit ke "ksheer" se miltaa-julata sajaateey shabd "sheer" he or akashganga ko "raah-e-shiri" bulaayaa jaataa he
 In English, the Milky Way is called the "milky Way", which also means "milk path"
 kuch purvi asian sabhyataaon ne "akashganga" shabd kii tarah akashganga main ek nadi dekhi
 The galaxy is called the "river of Silver" in Chinese and also "mirinae" in Korean
 akashganga ek sarpil gallexi he
 The diameter of its flat circle is about 100,000 light-years but its thickness is only 1,000 light-years
 akashganga kitni badi he iskaa anumaan is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ke agar hamaare puure saura mandal ke chakra ke kshetrafal ko ek rupee ke sikke jitna samaj liya jaae to uski tulana main akashganga kaa kshetrafal bharat kaa dedh guna hoga
 It is estimated that there are at least 1 trillion stars in the galaxy, but it is possible that the number may be up to 4 trillion
 tulana ke liye hamaari padosi gallexi andromeeda main 10 kharab taare ho sakate hai
 Andromeda also has a spiral shape
 akashganga ke chakra kii koi aisi seemaa nahin he jiske baad taare ekadam na hon, balki seemaa ke paas taron kaa ghanatv dhire-dhire kam hota jaataa he
 It has been observed that after a distance of 40,000 light years from the center, the density of stars starts decreasing rapidly
 vaigyanik iskaa kaaran abhi thik se samaj nahin paae hai
 Outside the main arms, there is a ring of stripped wires from another galaxy over a period of years, called a unicorn ring
 akashganga ke ird-gird ek gallexic sehara bhi he, jisamen taare or plasma gas kam ghanatv main maujuud he, lekin is sehre kaa aakaar akashganga kii do majalanic badal naam kii upgrahiy gallexiyon ke kaaran simit he
 Because humans are located within the circle of the galaxy, we have not been able to infer its exact shape
 ham puure akashganga ke chakra or uski bhujaaon ko dekh nahin sakate
 We get a full view of thousands of other galaxies in the sky, from which we get to know the different categories of galaxies
 akashganga kaa adhyayan karne ke baad ham keval anumaan laga sakate hai ke yah sarpil shrenee kii gallexi he
 But it is very difficult to find out how many main and how small asterisks the galaxy has
 upar se yah bhi dekha gaya he ke anya sarpil gallexiyon main bhujaayen kabhi-kabhi ajeeb dishaao main mudi hui hoti hai yaa phir vibhajit hokar upabhujaayen banati hai
 Scientists differ in the size of the arms due to these intricacies
 2008 tak mana jaataa tha ke akashganga kii chaar mukhya bhujaayen hai or kam-se-kam do choti bhujaayen hai, jinamein se ek shikari-hans bhujaa he jisapar hamaara saura mandal sthit he
 In a picture on the right, different arms are shown in different colors - 2008 main visconsin vishvavidhyalay ke robert banjamin ne apane anusandhan kaa nateeja ghoshit karte hue daawa kiya ke darasal akashganga kii keval do mukhya bhujaayen hai - parasius bhujaa or skutem-santoras bhujaa - or baaqi sari choti bhujaayen hai
 If this is true, then the size of the galaxy will be different from Andromeda and will be like a spiral galaxy named NGG 1365
 1990 ke dashak tak vaigyanik samajha karte the ke akashganga kaa ghanaa kendriya bhaag ek gole ke akar kaa he, lekin phir unhen shaq hone laga ke uskaa aakaar ek mote danda kii tarah he
 Photographs taken from the Spitzer space telescope in 2005 made it clear that his fears were correct: the center of the galaxy was in fact a dandenoid shaped more drawn than a sphere 
 2007 main akashganga main ek "echi 1523-0901" naam ke taare kii aayu 13
2 arab saal anumaanit kii gayi, isliye akashganga kam-se-kam utana purana to he hi
