 bharat kii adhikansh jagahon main falon ke udyaan main bhoomi par ghaas ugna vaanchhneeya nahin he or isliye thodi bahut godai aavashyak ho jaati he
 There is no doubt that the primary purpose of weeding or hoofing is the elimination of unwanted weeds, so it should be done only when they are small and have not deep-rooted their roots

 It has been observed that sometimes where other crops were very poor, the fruit garden flourishes very well without adding phosphorus material to the ground, probably because the fruit trees need phosphorus gradually
 It only happens
 khaadon main tathaa sabhi prakaar ke jeevajanit padaarthon main kuch-na-kuch fasphoras rahata he
 But the phosphorous special things are these - bone powder, basic slag and super phosphate which are used extensively
 isamen 16 se 40 pratishat fasphoras pentaxide rahata he
 In those soils that stabilize phosphorus, the first phosphorus must be added so that some phosphorus is left for plants even when stabilized, but those that do not stabilize phosphorus should not contain a large amount of phosphorus, Otherwise the balance will deteriorate and other components will fall
 jis bhoomi main sulabh potacium kii maatra bahut hi kam hoti he usamen potacium dene par darshneey antar padataa he, jo upaj kii vruddhi se spasht ho jaataa he
 Potassium sulfate and potassium chloride are commonly used for fertilizer

 vichaardhaara kaa saamaanya aashay raajnneetik siddhant rup main kisi samaaj yaa samooh main prachlit un vichaaron kaa samucchy he jinke aadhaar par vah kisi saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik sanghathan vishesh ko uchit yaa anuchit tehraata he
 Critics of ideology often treat it as a subject of faith that has no scientific basis
 tark diya jaataa he ki kisi vichaardhaara vishesh ke anuyaayi use apane aap main satya maanakar uskaa anusaran karte hai, uske satyaapan kii aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi jaati
 In fact, supporters of each ideology must offer some theory and logic to confirm it and try to instill faith and trust in the other's mind
 samyawad main vichaardhaara ko adhirachana kaa ang mana jaataa he, jahaan vah aarthik sambandhon ko pratibimbit karti he
 Communist chinthadhara holds that most ideas, especially those related to the organization of society, are class ideas
 ve vastav main us varg ke vichaar hote hai jiskaa us kaal main samaaj par prabhutv hota he
 That class imposes these ideas on the rest of the society because this class is the owner of all means of propaganda
 virdohi virgon vaale samaaj main vichaardhaaratmak sangharsh varg hiton ke sangharsh ke anuroop hota he, kyonki vichaardhaara yatharth kaa sachcha yaa jhootha pratibimb bhi ho saktaa he or vaigyanik yaa avaigyanik bhi ho saktaa he
 The interests of reactionary classes nurture false ideology
 pragatisheel, krantikari virgon ke hit vigyansammat chintanadhara kaa nirmaan karne main sahaayak hote hai
 According to communist beliefs, the development of ideology is ultimately determined by the economy, but at the same time there is some relative freedom
 isaki abhivyakti vishesh rup se vichaardhaara kii antarvastu kaa sidhe aarthik spashtikaran karne kii asambhavaneeyata main or saath hi aarthik tathaa vichaardhaaratmak vikaas kii kuch asamtalataa main hoti he
 Apart from all this, much of the expression of relative independence of ideology is in the operation of internal rules of ideological development, as well as in the other ideological spheres, which are situated far away from the economic base
 vichaardhaara kii saapeksh swatantraaa kaa kaaran yah he ki vichaardhaaratmak vikascram vibhinn aarthiketar karkon ke prabhavantargat rahata he
 These factors are: the internal sequential relationship in the development of ideology, the personal role of ideologues and the mutual influence of various forms of ideology, etc

 The bourgeois ideology is considered as a spiritual suffix that expresses only the interests of a particular group or party
 isi kaaran ve vigyaan or vichaardhaara ke antaron ko nirpeksh banane, unhen ek-duusare ke mukaable main rakhane ke icchhuk hote hai
 The bourgeoisie tries to do the so-called "uninterpretation" of philosophy and science

 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last emperor of the Mughal Empire in India and a noted poet of Urdu
 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana
 This order shows how big he was for hindu-muslim unity
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the
 According to literary critics, during the time of Zafar, where Mughal power was in decline, Urdu literature especially Urdu poetry was at its height
 jafar kii maut ke baad unki shaayari "kulliyaat e jafar" ke naam se sankalit kii gayi
 Accession of Bahadur Shah II captain hodsan dwaara bandi banaaye gayi bahadur shah dwitiya First War of Indian Independence supriya pilganvkar, aksar apane screen naam supriya ke naam se jaani jaati, ek marathi abhinetri hai vah marathi abhinayta sachin pilganvkar kii patni hai

 charyaapad 8veen se 12veen shatabdi ke bich sahajia buddha sidhon dwaara rachit geet hai jo sarvaadhik pracheen bangla sahitya ke udhaaharan hai
 The language of these posts is also very similar to Assamese and Oriya
 sahajia bauddhadharm kii utpatti mahayan se hui, atev yah swaabhaavik hi he ki mahayan bauddhadharm kii kuch visheshtaayen isamen pai jaati hai
 'charya' means conduct or behavior
 in padon main batalaaya gaya he ki sadhak ke liye kya aacharniya he or kya anacharaniya he
 The collection of these posts is titled as 'charyapad'
 sidhon kii sankhya churaasi kahi jaati he jinamein kuch pramukh siddh nimnlikhit hai : luipa, shabarapa, sarahapa, shantipa, kahnpa, jalandharapa, bhusukpa aadi
 It is difficult to decide the time of these Siddhas, yet generally their period can be considered from 800 AD to 1175 AD
 'charyaapad' main sangrahit padon kii rachana kuch aise rahasyatmak dhang se kii gai he or kuch aisi bhashaa kaa sahaara liya gaya he ki bina uske marm ko samajhe in padon kaa arth samajhnaa kathin he
 This language is called 'sandha' or 'sandhya Bhasha'
 'sandhya bhashaa' kaa arth kai prakaar se kiya gaya he
 Harprasad Shastri has interpreted the Sandhya language as 'light-dark-dark'
 unka kahana he ki usamen kuch prakaash or kuch andhkaar mili jule rahete hai, kuch samaj main aata he, kuch samajha main nahin aata
 Mahamahopadhyay Pandit Vidhushekhar Shastri holds that in reality the word is not 'sandhya Bhasha' but 'sandha Bhasha' and this means that the words in this language have been used in a meaningful and specifically specified sense
 in shabdon kaa abhishth arth anudhavanpurvak hi samajha ja saktaa he
 Hence it can be said that the term Sandhya or Sandha has been used in the sense of ‘abhidandhi’ or ‘sandhi’ only
 'abhisandhi' kaa taatpary yahan abhisht arth he athwa do arthon kaa milan he arthath us shabd kaa ek saadhaaran arth he tathaa doosraa abhishth arth
 That is why it is not appropriate to relate this word to the evening blur
 charyaapad kii sanskrit tikaa main tikaakar munidatt ne sandhya bhashaa shabd kaa prayog isi arth main kiya he
 21 In the verse of Sankhya Bhusukapada it is said, ‘nisi Andhari Musa Achara’
 isaki tikaa karte hue tikaakar ne kaha he, 'bhooshak: sandhyavachane chittapawan: boddhavy:'
 The registrar of the 'dohakosh' of Sarhapada has said Adyavajra- charyaapadon ke arth ko samajhane ke liy sahajia baudhon ke drushtikon ko samaj lenaa aavashyak he
 It is necessary to study these terms from both the spiritual and philosophical point of view
 charyaakaar sidhon ke liye sadhana hi mukhya vastu thi, vaise ve darshanik tatv ko bhi aankhon se ojhal nahin hone dete
 Sahajiya Buddhism originated from Mahayana, so it is only natural that some of the characteristics of Mahayana Buddhism are found in it
 sahajia sadhak kaa charam lakshya shunya kii prapti he; lekin vah shunya kya he? parmarth satya ke bare main nagarjun ne batalaaya he ki uske sambandh main yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vah he
 Then it cannot be said that he is not
 isi tarah yah bhi kahana sahi nahin ki vah he bhi or nahin bhi he, tathaa yah bhi kehane kaa upaay nahin he ki he or nahin bhi he in donon main koi bhi satya nahin
 In this way, the element which is a quadrilateral is called zero
 vaise anya buddha darshanikon ne isapar or tarah se bhi vichaar kiya he
 The scientific fundamentalism is called the zero element
 shunya hi gagan, rav athwa akaash he
 Changes took place in the form of Mahayana from chronology
 pracheen arhatgan nirvana kii prapti kaa charam lakshya maanate the, lekin mahayaniyon ne bodhisattva ke adarsh ko ucch mana
 According to the Mahayans, it is better than Nirvana to have compassion for the creatures of this world, wearing body after wearing body
 mahayani maanate hai ki karunaa kaa aadhaar adwaybodh he
 It is advisable to consider oneself fully with all beings
 is karunaa ko mahayaniyon ne apni sadhana, apni vichaardhaara kaa moolmantra sweekaar kiya
 He says that the position of Advais is the work of the seekers
 isamen sabhi sankalp vikalp vilupt ho jate hai
 In this situation, the knowledge of known nature, knowledge and gravitation is no more
 tantric baudhon ne nirvana kaa param sukh kaha
 According to him, 'mahasukh' is Nirvana
 ve maanate the ki vishesh sadhnapaddati dwaara chitt ko mahasukh main nimajjit kar dena hi sadhak kaa charam lakshya he
 The state of mind depressed in Mahasukh is the attainment of Bodhichitta
 chitt kii yah vah sthiti he jisaten chitt bodhilabh ke upyukt hokar tathaa use praapt kar sabhi praaniyon kii mangalsadhana main lag jaataa he
 From the point of view of practice, there are two streams of Advaita Bodhichitta: wisdom and remedy
 shoonyatagyaan ko tantric buddha saadhakon ne 'pragna' kaha he
 It is retirement-oriented and in this the mind of the seeker is not directed towards the welfare of the world, but keeps on his own side
 karunaa ko unhone upaay kaha he
 It is trend-oriented and employed in the practice of Vishwamangal
 in donon ke milan kaa 'pragnapay' kaha gaya he
 Bodhichitta is attained by the union of these two
 in donon ke milan kii nimnaga dhara hi sukh du:khawali trigunatmika sristi he or uski urdhvadhara kaa anusaran kar chalane main mahasukh kii prapti hoti he
 It has been called 'samrasya'
 shoonyata or karunaa paraspar virdohi dharmavali hai or swaabhaavik rup se nimnaga hai
 These two are the same 'samaras', flowing together in the middle
 jab ye urdhvagamini hoti hai, 'samras' kii vishuddhi hoti he or inaki urdhvatam avasthiti hi vishuddh samrasya hai
 The absolute form of this harmony is Sahajanand
 yahi adwayabodhichitt he
 The practice of achieving this is the ultimate goal of Sahajiya Buddhism
 is anand ko madhyamikon ne tatv mana he lekin buddha sahajia saadhakon ne ise rup tathaa naam pradaan kiya he or iskaa vasasthaan bhi batalaaya he
 They have called it Nairatma Devi and Parifavadhutika
 ise shoonyata kii sahachaarini kaha gaya he
 When the seeker becomes void of earthly illusion and becomes absorbed in the Dharmakaya, he dives into the great emptiness embracing the soul
 nairatma indriyagrahya nahi, isiliye ek pad main use asprishy dombi kaha gaya he or kaha gaya he ki nagar ke baahar arthath dehsumeru ke shikharapradesh arthath ushnishkamal main uskaa vasasthaan he: It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that, like the Hindu Tantra, in Buddhism, the seekers within the body also seek to attain that bodiless
 ida, pingala or sushumna ko baudhdhatantra main kramash: lalana, rasna or avadhooti yaa avadhootika kaha gaya he
 Avadhooto is the middle path through which one attains Adayabodhichitta or Sahajananda
 muladhar baudhdhatantra kaa vajraagaar he or sahasraar ke jaisaa 64 dalon kaa ushnish camel he, jisamen anand kaa aswadan hota he
 Other names for Eda, Pingala and Sushumna have been used in Chariyadas, such as Pragya, Lallana, Vamga, Voida, Vindu, Retirement, Cluster, Vajra, Kulish, Aali, Ganga, Chandra, Ratra, Prana, Chaman, for Eda
 A, Bhava etc
; Remedies for Pingala, Rasna, Dakshinaga, Karuna, Nad, Tendency, Grahaya, Padma, Kamal, Kali, Yamuna, Surya Diva, Apan, Dhaman, Vana, Nirvana, etc
 charyaapad ke adhyayan ke liye inaki jaankaree aavashyak he
 Ambarupet is a village in the district of Krishna, under the Andhra Pradesh state of India in the Nandigam division

 According to the consequentialists, the work which results in good results is good
 udhaaharan ke liye, adaalat main shapath lekar jhooth bolnaa aparaadh he, lekin parinamwad ke anusaar yadi aisa karne se kisi nirdosh vyakti kii jaan bachati he to aisa hi karnaa chaiye
 It is not a good or bad thing for consequentialists to follow written rules and laws
 bharat kii janaganana anusaar yah gaanv, tehsil kanth, jila muradabad, uttar pradesh main sthit he

 In 1922, Hubble announced that almost all the nebulae are associated with stars, and that their light comes from starlight
 unhone yah bhi pataa lagaaya ki utsarjan spectrum kii niharikaayen lagbhag hameshaa B1 yaa usase adhik garm se judy rahati hai, jabaki satat spectra yukt niharikaayen apekshaakrit thande taron ke saath prakat hoti hai
 Both Hubble and Henry Norris Russell conclude that the nebulae surrounding the hot stars are changing in some way

 landan ke researchron dwaara pichley saal rajya ke 6 jilon main karaae gaye survey ke anusaar ek vyakti ne bhi pakistan ke saath khadaa hone kii vakaalat nahin kii, jabaki kashmir main kattarpanthi algaavvaadi samay samay par isaki vakaalat karte rahete hai jab tak kii unako vahaan se aarthik madad milti rahati he
 From there the order comes closed and stoned and that order is served
 aatankwaad, algaavvaad, fasaad or dange- ye 4 shabd hai jinke madhyam se pakistan ne duniya ke kai mulkon ko pareshaan kar rakhaa he
 Especially, India is the most important target for him
 kyon? is ‘kyon’ ke kai jawab hai
 India has no clear policy
 bhartiya rajaneta nirnay lene se bhi darate hai yaa unamem shuturamurg pravriti viksit ho gai he
 Now they can not even think about the battle of r or Par because they keep fighting and making rhetoric all day
 seemaa par sainik mar rahe hai purvottar main jawan shahid ho rahe hai isaki bhartiya rajanetaaon ko koi chintaa nahin
 They also have to do politics on this
 kehete jarur hai ki deshhit ke liye sabhi ekajute hai lekin lagata nahin he
 These are notable: the matter is of Kashmir, then the people of Kashmir on both sides, whether they are Muslims or non-muslims, are leading lives and painful lives
 maje kar rahe hai to algaavvaadi, aatankwaadi or unke aakaa
 Their children roam around the country and abroad and live in all kinds of luxury
 bhartiya kashmir ke halaat to pakistani kashmir se kai guna zyada achche hai
 Many Muslim families from Pakistan occupied Kashmir have come and taken refuge in India
 pakistan ne donon hi taraf ke kashmir ko barbaad karke rakh diya he
 Neither the land nor the Kashmiri Muslims will benefit the land locked Azad country with an area equal to the 10th part of Bhutan
 pakistan or china kaa isse jarur bhala ho jayega or antat: yah hoga ki iske kuch hisse pakistan kha jayega or kuch ko china nigal legaa
 China has swallowed some part
 yah baat kattarpanthi kashmiriyon ko samaj main nahin aati or ve samajhnaa bhi nahin chaahate
 This is history: in 1947, partitioned India became independent
 us daur main bhartiya riyasaton ke vilay kaa kaary chal rahaa tha, jabaki pakistan main kabailiyon ko ekajute kiya ja rahaa tha
 Here the princely states of Junagadh, Kashmir, Hyderabad and Travancore were delaying the merger, while some independent states wanted
 iske chalate in rajyon main asthirataa faili thi
 The problem of merging Kashmir was more complex than the problem of Junagadh and Hyderabad
 kashmir main musalmaan bahusankhyak the lekin panditon kii taadaad bhi kam nahin thi
 The problem was complicated due to the border of Kashmir with Pakistan, so Jinnah immediately started working on a plan to occupy Kashmir
 haalanki bharat or pakistan kaa bantwaaraa ho chukaa tha jisamen kshetron kaa nirdhaaran bhi ho chukaa tha phir bhi jinna ne paristhiti kaa laabh uthaate hue 22 oktober 1947 ko kabaili luteron ke bhesh main pakistani sena ko kashmir main bhej diya
 Rivers of blood were washed away in present-day occupied Kashmir
 is khooni khel ko dekhakar kashmir ke shaasha raja harisingh bhaybheet hokar jammu laut aae
 There he demanded military assistance from India, but it was too late to reach aid
 nehru kii jinna se dosti thi
 They could not think that Jinnah would do something like this
 lekin jinna ne aise kar diya
 At the time of partition of India, the issue of Kashmir remained unresolved due to wavering policy and short-sightedness of the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 yadi puraa kashmir pakistan main hota yaa puraa kashmir bharat main hota to shaayad paristhitiyaan kuch or hotin
 But this could not happen, because Kashmir was ruled by King Harisingh and after a long time he decided that Kashmir should be merged with India
 der se kiye gaye is nirnay ke chalate pakistan ne gilgit or baltistan main kabyli bhejkar lagbhag aadhe kashmir par kabja kar liya
 The Indian Army was advancing rapidly, rescuing the Pakistani Army's sixes, reclaiming the Kashmiri territory they had occupied, that on 31st December 1947, Nehruji appealed to the UNO to call on the north-west robbers of Pakistan
 Prevented from invading India
 falswaroop 1 janvari 1949 ko bharat-pakistan ke madhya yuddh-viraam kii ghoshnaa karai gai
 Earlier in 1948, Pakistan disguised its army into Indian Kashmir in the form of tribesmen and tried to capture the entire valley, which failed
 nehruji ke yuano main chale jane ke kaaran yudhviram ho gaya or bhartiya sena ke haath bandha gaye jisase pakistan dwaara kabja kiye gaye shesh kshetra ko bhartiya sena praapt karne main phir kabhi safal na ho saki
 Today, half of the area in Kashmir is the Line of Control and in some areas the international border
 antarrashtriya seemaa se lagaataar firing or ghuspaith hoti rahati he
 After this, Pakistan tried to occupy Kashmir in 1965 with its military force, due to which it had to face mouth
 is yuddh main pakistan kii haar hui
 Stung by the defeat, Pakistan acted to spread hatred towards India and the entire politics of Pakistan became based on Kashmir, that is, if you want power, then talk about seizing Kashmir
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki 1971 main usne phir se kashmir ko kabjane kaa prayaas kiya
 Then the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi fought it out and eventually 1 lakh soldiers of Pakistan Army surrendered to the Army of India and an independent country called 'bangladesh' was born
 indira gandhi ne yahaan ek badi bhul kii
 If she wanted to, the problem of Kashmir would have been solved here forever, but she came under the influence of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and 1 lakh soldiers were released
 is yuddh ke baad pakistan ko samaj main aa gai ki kashmir hathiyaane ke liye aamane-saamne kii ladaai main bharat ko haraa paanaa mushkil hi hoga
 After a humiliating defeat in 1971, soldiers were sworn in to revenge the defeat at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kabul, and preparations for the next war began to be carried out but the situation in Afghanistan began to deteriorate
 1971 se 1988 tak pakistan kii sena or kattarpanthi afghanistan main uljhe rahe
 Here the Pakistan army strengthened itself in guerrilla warfare and learned new methods as options for war

 The politics of India changed after the assassination of Mrs
 Indira Gandhi on 31 October 1984 as an unfortunate Operation Blue Star in Golden Temple and its revenge action
 ek shaktishaalee netaa kii jagah ek anubhav or vichaarheen netaa rajeev gandhi ne jab desh kii bagdor sanbhali to unke aalochak kehane lage the ki unke paas koi yojana nahin or koi niti bhi nahin he
 Many people rejected what he said during the 1984 riots
 unhone kashmir kii taraf se puri tarah se dhyaan hataakar punjab or srilanka main laga diya
 The road to India changed after Indira Gandhi
 punjab main aatankwaad ke is nae khel ke chalate pakistan kii najar ek baar phir muslim bahul bhartiya kashmir kii ore tik gai
 He started preparing people for terror in Pak occupied Kashmir
 afghanistan kaa anubhav yahaan kaam aane laga tha
 The then President General zia-ul-haq planned a 'war with low intensity' against India in 1988 under the name 'operation Topak'
 is yojana ke tahat bhartiya kashmir ke logon ke man main algaavvaad or bharat ke prati nafrat ke beej bone the or phir unheen ke haathon main hathiyaar thamane the
 After many mouths, Pakistan began to think of a new kind of war against its more powerful enemy in the 90s and eventually called it 'war of Low Intensity'
 darasal, yah gorilla yuddh kaa hi viksit rup he
 Indian politicians knew everything but still they were silent, because they were worried about more votes than India, worried about alliances, worrying about staying in power

 Except for Kashmir and the Northeast, Indian politicians kept paying attention everywhere
 ‘oparation topaak’ pehle se duusare or duusare se tisare charan main pahunch gaya
 Now his intention was not only to keep Kashmir disturbed, he started being active in Jammu and Ladakh too
 pakistani sena or iesai ne milakar kashmir main dange karaae or uske baad aatankwaad kaa silsilaa chal padaa
 Increasing the number of mosques in the first phase, evacuating non-muslims and Shias from Kashmir in the second phase and preparing the public for rebellion in the third phase
 ab iskaa chauthaa or antim charan chal rahaa he
 Now Pakistani flags are waved publicly and openly against India, because there are no non-muslim nor Shias in the Kashmir Valley
 kashmir main aatankwaad ke chalate kareeb 7 lakh se adhik kashmiri pandit visthapit ho gaye or ve jammu sahit desh ke anya hisson main jaakar rahane lage
 During this time thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were killed
 haalanki abhi bhi kashmir ghati main lagbhag 3 hajaar kashmiri pandit rahete hai lekin ab ve ghar se kam hi baahar nikal pate hai
 According to former UK Foreign Minister Jack Straw, problems like the Kashmir dispute and the arab-israel conflict are a product of Britain's colonial past
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke samay britani shashan ne dhulmul ravaiya apanaaya tha jo is vivaad kaa kaaran bana
 Senior BJP leader and MP Shanta Kumar said that the dispute in Kashmir was a gift of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country

 The indo-pakistan War of 1947–1948, sometimes known as the First Kashmir War, was fought between India and Pakistan between the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu from 1947 to 1948

 == sandarbh ==yah 10dec me banaya jata he | a Dental Thermometer]] tapamapi yaa tharmametre vah yukti he jo taap yaa 'taap kii pravanta' ko maapne ke kaam aati he
 'thermometry' is the name of the branch of physics in which the methods of thermometry are considered
 tapamapi anek siddhanton ke aadhaar par nirmit kiye ja sakate hai
 The volume of liquids increases by consuming heat and this increase in volume is proportional to temperature
 saadhaaran tharmametre isi siddhanth par kaam karte hai
 To determine the unit of temperature, a substance is placed in two fixed thermal equilibria respectively
 inako niyat bindu kehete hai
 In these states, the magnitudes of a particular property of the substance are removed and their differences are divided equally over a certain number
 inamen se prayek ansh tapamaapan kii ikai maani jaati he, jisko ek ansh athwa degree kehete hai
 For long time, the thermometer and the steam point have been used in thermometers as fixed points
 jis taap par shuddh barf or shuddh vayusantrupt pani ek vayumandal ke daab par saath saath samyavastha main rahete hai usko himbindu kehete hai
 Similarly, the equilibrium of pure water and pure steam at a certain pressure is called the steam point
 saamaanya tharmamitaron main shishe kii ek choti khokhli ghundi hoti he, jisamen paara yaa drav bharaa rahata he
 Due to thermal diffusion, fluid enters the tube
 urpyukt donon niyat binduon par nalee main drav ke tal ke saamne chihn laga die jate hai
 In the centigrade scale, now called the Celcius scale, the icepoint is assumed to be zero and the point to 100 degrees
 in donon chinhon ke bich kii duuri ko 100 sam bhaagon main baant diya jaataa he
 In the Fahrenheit scale, both these points are considered to be 32 and 212 degrees respectively and their difference is divided into 180 parts
 uparyukt tapamapiyon main tapakram tapiya prasaaran par aadhaarit he, kintu aisa aavashyak nahin
 Any property, which grows uniformly according to the temperature, can be used for this purpose
 vastav main prayogshaala ke anek sugrahi tapamapi vidyutpratirodh ke parivartan yaa tapavidyut par aadhaarit hote hai
 Like properties, there is no restriction on liquids
 koi bhi padaarth tapamapi main prayukt kiya ja saktaa he, kintu mukhya samasya yah he ki padaartho or gunon ke bhed se jo vibhinn tapamapi nirmit ho sakate hai unase donon niyat binduon ko chhodkar anya sab tapon par paathyaankon main bhed milegaa
 This proves that all these can not be considered basically authentic
 siddhanthata ushmagatiki par aadhaarit maapcrap swat:pramaan mana jaataa he or duusare paimaane uske anusaar shuddh kar liye jate hai
 In this science, an engine is conceived that takes heat from a furnace and converts part of it into work with maximum efficiency, and gives the remaining part to a low-temperature condenser
 isko carno ingine, athwa prativarti izn, kehete hai
 According to the theory, if several different thermal pairs of the furnace and condenser are assembled and a Carno engine is fitted between each, then the work done by it is proportional to the temperature difference of these pairs
 is prakaar kaary ke maapan se tapantar gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The efficiency of this engine does not depend on the amount of liquid in its cylinder and its state, hence it is considered as the basis of temperature and the temperature determined by it is called paramatap
 centegrade or fahrenheit paimaane kii tarah paramtaap mapkram kaa shunya manamaana nahin hota
 The work done by the Carno engine depends on the temperature of both the furnace and the condenser
 sanghnitr kii tapiya avasthaa aisi bhi ho sakati he ki yah ingine bhatthi se praapt samast ooshmaa ko kaary main badal de or sanghnitr ko uskaa koi bhi ansh praapt na ho
 In such a situation, the temperature of the condenser is considered zero
 degree kaa pariman nirdhaaran karne ke liye pehle kii tarah do niyat binduon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Before 1954, snow and steam points were also used in the paramatap scale
 in donon ke tapabhed ko 100° param mana jaataa tha
 This means that the centenary work of the work obtained by placing the Carne engine furnace on the steampoint and the condenser on the icepoint exhibits a degree of work
 is prabandh main badi kathinaayee yah padati he ki himbindu kii yatharthata simit he or bhinn vaigyanikon dwaara praapt raashimaanon main ± 01° paa tak kaa antar paaya jaataa he
 To avoid this, only one fixed point has been used since 1954 as per international determination
 trikbindu us taap ko kehete hai jisapar pani, barf or jalawaashp kaa samya sambhav he
 Its value has been voluntarily assumed to be 273
16 ° Pa
 aisa kaha ja saktaa he ki san 1954 se purv paramtaap paimaana teen binduon, dwaara nirghaarit hota tha, kintu ab keval do binduon kaa upyog hota he
 In other words, one of the two fixed points mentioned at the beginning of this article is Paramashuni and the other is Trikbindu
 trikbindu or paramashunya ke bich kaary karanevaale carno ingine dwaara jo kaary hota he uskaa 1 / 273
16 ansh kaary ek param degree kaa bodh karata he
 The engine of Carno is ideal and in practice its construction is not possible, but it can be proved that the thermometer's readings produced by the thermal diffusion of the ideal gas are equal to the permittivity
 at: adarsh gas paimaana swat: pramaan, athwa praathmik maanak, mana jaataa he
 An ideal gas is a gas that follows the following law: jisamen daab, aaytan tathaa paramataap hote he
 Is a constant whose value is the same for a gram-molecule quantity of each ideal gas
 gas tharmametre do prakaar ke hote hai, ek to sthir aaytan vaale or duusare sthir daab vaale
 The earlier action is simple and its errors can be corrected reliably
 at: sthir aaytan tapamapiyon kaa hi upyog hota he
 As the name suggests, pressure is measured by keeping the volume of the gas constant
 adarsh gas tapamapi se taap nikaalane main athak parishram or samay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is possible to have errors in the text due to many reasons and the result obtained for them has to be amended

 From this it is proved that gas thermometer may not be suitable for daily work in the laboratory
 isaliye antarrashtriya nishchay ke anusaar kuch padaarthon ke galnaank or kvathanank praathmik maanak ke rup main prayukt hote hen
 These scores have been properly measured after much diligence from the ideal gas scale and their values have gained international acceptance

 Just as heat increases the length of materials, similarly the resistance of metal wires also increases by heat

 Many metal wires are used for this work
 phir bhi platinum taar ke bane tapamapi kaa mahatv isaliye adhik hota he kyonki vah antarrashtriya paimaane ke antarveshan ke liye prayukt hota he
 The wire must be pure metal and deformation free

 Several types of electrodes are used for resistivity
 inamen calendar-griffith kaa sethu purana or sarvavidit he
 It is based on the principle of Wheatstone Bridge
 pratiroshmapan ke platinum taar ko jin vaahak taron se sanyukt kiya jaataa he ve bhi ooshmaa se garm ho jate hai, jisase unke pratirodh main bhi parivartan ho jaataa he
 This change is also measured by the bridge and becomes the cause of inaccuracy in the calculation of heat
 calendar griffith sethu se is truti ko dur karne ke liye thik isi prakaar ke vaahak taar sethu kii sanyugmi bhujaa main bhi daal die jate hai
 Both pairs live close by in the thermometer and have a similar heat effect
 is kaaran sethu ke santulan or maapit pratirodh par inkaa koi asar nahin hota
 Another way to correct this error is to measure the difference between the ends of the platinum wire by not removing its resistance
 taar ke andar nishchit maatra main vidyudhara kaa pravaah kiya jaataa he
 Differential measurements are taken by connecting its two ends with a potentiometer
 pratirodh ke samaanupati hone ke kaaran vibhavantar se om ke niyamanusaar pratirodh kii gananaa kar lee jaati he
 In these, the effect of resistance of the carrier wires is completely lost
 yadi do bhinn dhaatuon ke taar ek paripath main sanyukt hon or unke sangambinduon ko bhinn taap par rakhaa jaay to paripath main vidyut dhara kaa pravaah hane lagata he
 This current can be seen in the circuit by the sensing capacitor
 dhara ke utpaadak bal, arthath vidyudvahak bal kaa maan k or kha ke tapantar par nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, it can be measured by measuring temperature
 aise taar ke jodon ko tapantar yugma kehete hai
 The metals of the heating pairs used in the international scale are described above, but various metals are used in the laboratory keeping in mind the requirements of sensitivity and use
 tapantar yugma main vi0 vaa0 ba0 tapantar par nirbhar hota he, isaliye nimna tapawale sangam kaa taap sthir rakhaa jaataa he
 EMF is measured by combining the ends a and b with a potentiometer or millivoltmometer
 milivoltmapi main yah sidhaa maapit hota he, parantu yah utana sugrahi nahin he jitna vibhavamaapi
 When a solid object is heated, it radiates energy in the form of electromagnetic waves
 kam tapavriddhi hone par tarangon kaa tarangadairghy kam hota he or unase ooshmaa kaa anubhav hota hai
 At higher temperatures, there is an excess of waves with shorter wavelengths, which reflect light
 vikeern urja kii maatra or uske gun garm vastu kii avasthaa par bhi nirbhar karte hai
 a completely black object has the property that it exploits all the radiated energy on it and automatically radiates maximum energy
 aisi vastu ko krishna vastu athwa krishnaka bhi kehete hai
 If the walls of a closed hollow body are placed on the stratosphere, then the radiated energy produced within it is completely similar in properties and quantity to black body radiation
 at: prayogshaala main krishnika ke liye aise hi khokhale bartan kaa upyog karte hai
 It is necessary to make a small hole in it, so that energy can come out from within and it is possible to study its properties
 ucchtam taapmaana ke liye krishnika kaa upyog karte hai
 There are two types of thermometers based on it
 ek main purna vikiran kii maatra kaa paapan kiya jaataa he
 This is called full radiation thermometer
 duusaren prakaar main vikiran ke gunon kaa adhyayan karte hai
 These are called optical thermometer
 in uttapamapiyon main yah gun hota he ki inamen tapamapi ko garm padaarth se sanlagn rakhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or inase unchaa taap maapit ho saktaa he
 But the drawback of these is that in principle only the temperature of the black body is possible
 anya vastuon kaa taap vaastavik taap se kam milegaa, jiske liye sanshodhan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is based on Stephen's law
 is niyam ke anusaar kisi krishnika dwaara vikeern urja, param taap ke chauthe ghaat kii samaanupati hoti he, arthath Is a constant
 tapamaapan ke liye ucchatapiya vastu kaa vikiran kisi lens athwa darpan se tapantar yugma ke ek sire par focus kar dete he usase urja oogyaat ho jaati he
 If the constants are known, heat can be calculated by the above equation
 vastav main anek trutiyon ke kaaran taap kaa ghaat 4 se thodaa bhinn hota he
 So in practice let's use the equation given below: isamen or sthiraank hai
 b must be 4 according to Stephen's rule, but here it is considered unknown
 ucchatapiya krishnika kaa taap or tapantar yugma ko taap he
 a and b is assumed by placing the thermometer in front of black bodies of certain temperatures
 yantra main vikiran ke focusikaran kaa aisa prabandh rahata he ki usase maapit taap ucchatapiya vastu kii duuri par nirbhar nahin karata
 If the object is not completely Krishna then amendment is done for this inaccuracy
 inamen krishnika se praapt vikiran ke varnakram kaa sookshm ansh, jiskaa tarangadairghy lagbhag ek hota he, chhant liya jaataa he or isaki tivrata kii tulana ek maanak lamp kii vikiran tivrata se kii jaati he
 If the radiation intensity of the black body at the altitude for the wavelength is its intensity, then according to Planck's rules ek sthiraank hota he jiskaa maan plank siddhant dwaara nishchit he
 If E1, E2 and T1 are known, then T2 becomes known
 adrishy tantu attapamapiyon main maanak batti kii vikirantivrata main is prakaar parivartan karte hai ki uski tivrata maapi janevaali vikeern urja kii tivrata ke baraabar ho jaae
 At that time, the fiber of the light disappears
 ek anya prakaar ke prakaashiya uttapamapiyon main maanak vikiran kii tivrata sthaayee rakhi jaati he or agyaat taap ke pind ke vikiran ke sahit uttapamapi main pravesh karti hai
 The grains are stacked in vertical planes
 aisa prabandh kiya jaataa he ki prayek vikiran kaa pratibimb ardhgoleey tathaa ek duusare se sata hua bane
 They are seen by a nickel prism, which is rotated so much that the light of both the reflections is the same
 nikal ke ghurnanakon se E1 / E2 gyaat karke uparokt sutara se taap gyaat kar lete hai
 Measurement of 'low temperature' up to 1900 c is described in relation to the international scale
 isse kam taap ke liye vashpadabeey tapamapiyon kaa prayog hota he
 The vapor pressure of a fluid depends on its temperature
 at: gaison ko drav rup main parinat karke unako vashpadabamapiyon main bhar lete hai
 Temperature is determined immediately by the amount of pressure
 iske liye oxygen, nitrogen tathaa helium drav rup main prayukt hote hai
 Helium can be measured up to about 10 by volatile thermometers
 isse nimna taap ke liye chumbakeey tapamapiyon kaa prayog hota he
 In this, a paramagnetic salt is measured and calculated according to Curie's law and removes heat
 saadhaarant: is taap main trutiyaan hoti hai, jinka sanshodhan karke paramtaap nikaala jaataa he
 The mercury thermometer is well known
 apane anek gunon ke kaaran yah sarvasaamaanya rup se prayog main laayaa jaataa he, kintu isaki yatharthata simit hoti he
 Where special precision is required, its reading has to be amended for many errors
 inamen sabase mukhya truti yah hoti he ki shunya chinh badalata rahata he
 This happens for two reasons
 tapamapi jab banaaya jaataa he uske bahut samay pashchaat tak uskaa sheesha sikudta rahata he, jisase shunya chinh badalata rahata he
 Secondly, whenever the temperature of a hot object is measured, the glass takes a long time to return to its normal state
 anternihit thermodinemic niyamon or raashiyon ke bhautik aadhaar kii jaankaree ke str ke anusaar tapamapi yaa tharmametre ko do alag samoohon main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 For a primary thermometer, the measured properties of the material are so well known that the temperature can be calculated without any unknown magnitude
 iske udhaaharan ve tapamapi hai jo ek gas kii avasthaa ke sameekaran par, ek gas main dhwani ke veg par, thermal shor voltage yaa ek vidyut pratirohak ke pravaah par or ek chumbakeey kshetra main kuch radiodharmee nabhik ke gamma kiran utsarjan kii koniya asamdigvarti hone kii dasha par aadhaarit hote hai
 Primary thermometers are relatively complex
 == prayog ==doctori tharmametre se96°©se110°©kii taap maapi jaati he
 2- The mercury of mercury is -39 ° ©
 tathaa isse neeche kaa taap maapne ke liye alcohol yukt tharmametre kaa prayog karte he
 Alcohol has a -155 ° ©
 3-pyrometer se surya kaa taap mapa jaataa he

 The South Asia satellite, formerly called the SAARC satellite, is a geosynchronous communications and meteorological satellite created by the Indian Space Research Organization for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
 2014 main nepal main yojit 18wein saarc shikhar sammelan ke dauraan, bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek upgrah saarc ke sadsy deshon kii aavashyaktaaon kii seva kaa vichaar rakhaa tha
 Which was part of their 'first neighborhood' policy
 haalanki upgrah saarc kshetra main seva karne kaa iraadaa he, pakistan kaarykram se baahar nikal gaya, jabaki afghanistan or bangladesh ne apni vachanabaddhata dene kaa vaayada nahin kiya tha
 During the Indian general election campaign in 2014, Narendra Modi indicated that he would actively focus his foreign policy on improving relations with India's neighboring countries
 narendra modi ne bharat ke pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath grahan samaaroh main saarc deshon ke sabhi shasnadhyakshon ko aamantrit kiya or vyaktigat rup se sabhi ke saath dwipaksheeya vaarta kii
 It was called a small SAARC summit by the media
 bharat ek sakriy antariksh kaarykram vaala desh he
 By 1975, India was able to project satellite and became the first South Asian country to project satellite
 dakshin asia main keval bharat raashtra hi antariksh main upgrahon ko sanchalit or safaltaapurvak prakshepit kar saktaa he
 While such progress has been a struggle for other South Asian countries
 bharat ke pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath lene ke ek maheene ke baad june 2014 main modi ne bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan se saarc upgrah viksit karne ke liye poocha
 Which can be dedicated as 'gifts' to neighbors
 unhone upgrah par kaam karne ke liye vaigyanikon ko kaha
 India will hereby provide a full range of all applications and services from its neighboring countries
 modi ne kaha, "saarc deshon main garibi bahut he or iske liye vaigyanik samaadhaan kii jarurat he
 " march 2015 main srilankai sansad main apane sambodhan main modi ne kaha, "srilanka saarc kshetra ke liye bharat ke upgrah kaa puraa laabh le saktaa he
 It should be in space by December 2016
 "" ISRO Chairman AS Kiran Kumar said the satellite could be launched within 18 months of receiving approval from SAARC member countries
 yah 12 keyu-band transponder ke saath yukt he tathaa bhartiya bhusthir upgrah prakshepan yaan jieselvi emke dwitiya kaa upyog karke ise prakshepit karne kaa prastaav tha
 The total cost of launching the satellite was estimated to be around Rs 235 crore
 is prakshepan ke saath judi laagat bharat kii sarkaar se puri kii jaaegi
 The proposed satellite enables a full range of applications and services in the areas of telecommunications and broadcasting i
e
 television, direct-to-home, tele-education, tele-medicine and disaster management
 dakshin asia satellite ke paas 12 keyu band transponder hai, jo bharat ke padosi sanchaar badhaane ke liye upyog kar sakate hai
 Each country will also have access to at least one transponder, through which they can beam their programming as well as 'south Asian programming'
 prayek desh ko apane mul aadharbhoot dhaanche kaa vikaas karnaa hoga, haalanki bharat sahaayta badhaane or jaanane ke liye taiyaar he
 The satellite will enable "a full range of applications and services for its neighbors in the areas of telecommunications and broadcast applications such as television, direct-to-home, very small aperture terminals, tele-education, telemedicine and disaster management support," according to the government
 dakshin asia satellite ke paas is kshetra main bhaag lene vaale deshon main surakshit hot line uplabdh karaane kii kshamta bhi he, kyonki is kshetra main bukamp, chakravaat, baadh, sunami aadi hone kii sambhaavna he, isse aapadaaon ke samay mahatvapurn sanchaar link uplabdh karaane main madad mil sakati he
 On 5 May 2017, ISRO successfully launched the GSAT-9, a South Asia satellite of around 2230 kg
 ise jieselvi-epa09 rocket ke jariye sriharikota se prakshepit kiya gaya
 Pakistan, however, was silent on this announcement
 lekin baad main upgrah kii suraksha or mishan gunjaaish ke bare chintaa jataai
 Pakistani concerns are marked by the fact that India could access key data on the infrastructure of Pakistan's sensitive information database from satellites
 pakistan apane antariksh or upree vayumandal anusandhan ayog ke adheen swayan sakriy antariksh kaarykram rakhata he
 India is the only country in SAARC
 jo antariksh main upgrahon ko sanchalit or laanch karne kii kshamta he
 In a separate meeting with officials of the Indian Space Research Organization, Superco officials proposed a joint monetary and technical venture with the development of the satellite
 bharat sarkaar ne peshkash ko thukraa diya
 Because he insisted that this is a gift project from India to SAARC neighbors
 27 june 2015 ko, isro ke adhyaksh e es kiran kumaar ne ghoshnaa kii ki bharat or pakistan kii superko isro ke maargdarshan main takneekee ejineering ke pradarshan ke saath saarc upgrah ko viksit karne main sahyog karenge
 During the 70th United Nations meeting in New York City held on 20 September 2015, officials in India and Pakistan debated the control and ownership of the satellite
 2 oktober 2015, bharat ne ghoshnaa kii he ki hamane yah nirnay liya he ki bharat pakistan kii sahmati ke bina upgrah ke nirmaan shuru kar denge
 23 March 2016 As a development, the official spokesperson of India's Ministry of External Affairs said, "pakistan has decided to opt out of the satellite project
 isliye ise ek saarc upgrah nahin kaha ja saktaa
 It will be a South Asia satellite
 " Afghanistan and Bangladesh have recently shown no interest in citing alternative space program commitments for the project
 srilanka ke raashtrapati mathripala sirisena ne modi ko upgrah praudyogiki kaa istemaal karte hue badhai di or daawa kiya ki isse logon ke staron main sudhaar hoga
 In linguistics, the study of word-form based on the structural unit of morphology is called pedology or morphology
 duusare shabdon main, 'shabd' ko 'pad' main badalane kii prakriya ke adhyayan ko rupavigyaan kaha jaataa he
 Morphology is a major part of linguistics
 iske antargat pad ke vibhinn anshon - mul prakruti tathaa upsarg, pratyay, vibhakti - kaa samyak vishleshan kiya jaataa he isaliye katipay bhartiya bhashashastriyon ne padvigyaan ko "prakruti-pratyay-vichaar" kaa naam bhi diya he
 In the grammar of language, pedagogy has a special importance
 vyakaran / bhashavigyaani vaakyon kaa varnan karata he or yah varnan yathasambhav purna or laghu ho, iske liye vah padon kii kalpana karata he
 Therefore, he has been called the incumbent
 padon se chalakar hi ham vaakyarth or vaakyoccharan tak pahunchate hai
 "to make the right division of a language right means to have full knowledge of the grammar of that language"
 rup ke adhyayan kii drushti ke aadhaar par rupavigyaan ke vibhinn prakaar ginaae gaye hai- Indian masters have given two conditions of words - Siddha and Imperfect
 inamen "asiddh" shabd ko keval "shabd" tathaa "siddh" shabd ko "pad" ke rup main parinat kiya jaataa he
 The Sumbat and Tirta of "siddhi" and many distinctions of "imperfect" have been discerned
 yahan tak ki sanskrit kaa prayek shabd "dhaatuj" tehraaya gaya he
 The nomenclature of grammar and its definition has been made keeping in mind the same process, viz
, Vrānusāsana and "vyakryante vivikyante shabda: anen iti grammar
" " paashchaatya vidvan dhaatvansh ko aavashyak nahin maanate, ve aadhaar roopaanshon ko naam evam aakhyaat donon ke liye alag alag sweekaar karte hai
 In fact, many languages do not require corroboration
 is prakaar roopaanshon kii paribhaasha paashchaatya vidvan bluemfield or naida ke anusaar shabd "bhashaa kii arthpurna laghutam ikai" he
 It can be divided into base plurals and relation plots
 unhen kram se bhashaa ke arthtatv evam sambandhtatv kah sakate hai
 There are mainly three forms of reciprocal relations of Arthaattva and Kinshipatva
 ek sanyukt jahaan donon abhinn rup ho jate hai, doosraa ishat sanyukt yaa ardhasanyukt; isamen donon ko pruthak pruthak pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 The third isolate, where both express their meaning separately
 sanyukt rup ke antargat pracheen arya, sami hami aadi bhashaaon kii gananaa kii gai he
 The basic nature of it changes
 greek prathama ek
 bouse, san
 go:, greek pu
dwi
 jugon, san
, yugma sanskrit purlig pan
ek
 agne:, arabi qitl, katl, kaatil, qutil aadi
 In separate form, the relation has a separate existence
 aadhunik arya, chini aadi bhashaayen isi koti kii hai
 The example of Sanskrit Avvaya, the modern Aryan languages are examples of this
 yatha san
 iti evam, c aadi, hindi ko, se, kaa, kii, ke, main par or, jab, aadi
 Such grammatical words in Chinese are called blank or meaningless
 yatha- tsi, mu, sung 
 The relation of form is also related to tone or stress
 chini, africa bhashaaon main is udhaaharan kii bahulata he
 English Conduct, Conduct, Huo Chinese
 iske antargat shabdakram bhi sambandhroop ko prakat karata he
 For example, gin, jint ngotan nittanmo - you kill me
 is sabandhatatvon ke dwaara bhashaa kii vibhinn vyakarnatmak dhaaraon kaa nirdhaaran hota he
 With this, expression of gender, speech, factor, man, call, question, prohibition etc
 is possible in the language
