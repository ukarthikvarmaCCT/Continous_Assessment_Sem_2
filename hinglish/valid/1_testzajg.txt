 In different countries and religions of the world, avatarism is seen in terms of respect and reverence similar to religious law
 purvi or pashchimi dharmon main yah saamanyat: maanya tathy ke rup main sweekrut kiya gaya he
 Avatarism has a special reputation in Hinduism
 atyant pracheen kaal se vartmaan kaal tak yah us dharm ke aadharbhoot moulik siddhanton main anyatam he
 The literal meaning of 'avatar' is - the physical manifestation of God by his own independent power, manifesting in physical form
 'avatar' tatv kaa dyotak pracheenatam shabd 'pradurbhaav' he
 In the Srimad Bhagwat, the word 'person' is used in this sense
 
 The fact of incarnation is considered particularly important in Vaishnava religion, because the doctrine of Pancharoopadhana called Vishnu, Vibhava, Antaryami and Archa is the fundamental element of Pancharatra
 isiilie vaishnavajan bhagwaan ke in naanaa roopon kii upasna apni ruchi tathaa priti ke anusaar adhiktar karte hai
 a description of Lord Shankar's maternal pastimes is found in Shaivamat
 parantu bhagavan shankar tathaa bhagwati parvati ke mul rup kii upasna hi is mat main sarvatra prachlit he
 The prestige of the world remains only when the state of 'rit' and destruction of the world is inevitable in the absence of this balance
 sristi ke rakshak bhagwaan is santulan kii suvyavastha main sadaiv dattachitt rahete hai
 In the place of 'rit', there is an incarnation of God whenever there is predominance of 'anrit', in the place of religion, iniquity
 sadhu kaa paritran, durjan kaa vinaash, adharm kaa naash tathaa dharm kii sthapana is mahneey uddeshy kii purti ke liye bhagwaan avatar dhaaran kehete he
 This verse of the Gita is considered the great mantra of Avatarism: parantu ye uddeshy bhi avatar ke liye gaun rup hi maane jate hai
 The main purpose of the avatar is completely different from this
 sarvaishyarvasampann, apraadheen, karmkaladikon ke niamak tathaa sarvanirpeksh bhagwaan ke liye dushtadalan or shishtrakshan kaa kaary to itar sadhano se bhi siddh ho saktaa he, tab bhagwaan ke avatar kaa mukhya prayojan shrimadbhagwat ke anusaar kuch doosraa hi he: The donation of absolute salvation to humans is the conscious purpose of God's revelation
 bhagwaan swat: apane lilavilas se, apane anugrah se, saadhakon ko bina kisi sadhana kii apeksha rakhte hue, mukti pradaan karte hai-avatar kaa yahi moulik tathaa pradhan uddeshy he
 In the Puranas we find a detailed and comprehensive description of Avatarism
 is kaaran is tatv kii udbhaavna puraanon kii dein maananaa kisi bhi tarah nyaayay nahin he
 In the Vedas, we find the fundamental and oldest basis of avatarism
 vedon ke anusaar prajapati ne jeevon kii raksha ke liye tathaa sristi ke kalyaan ke liye naanaa roopon ko dhaaran kiya
 Matsyarupa is indicated in the Satapatha Brahmana, in the Satapatha and Jaiminiya Brahmana, in the Taittiriya Samhita of Varaha and in the Taittiriya Aranyak of Narsingh in Satapatha and in the Taittiriya Samhita of Vamana and in Vishnu in the Rigveda
 rugveda main trivikram vishnu ko teen dagon dwaara samgr vishwa ke naapane kaa bahush: shrey diya gaya he 
 Later, in the place of Prajapati, when Vishnu's description of the form, incarnation and phenomena of such incarnations is very dependent on the Veda itself
 bhagwat ke anusaar satvanidhi hari ke avtaron kii gananaa nahin kii ja sakati
 Just as thousands of small rivers come out of a pond that does not dry up, similarly aksaraya sattvashraya hari also generates many avatars - avatara hasankhyaya hare: satavanidhdevija:

 There are mainly four types of avatars in the Pancharatra Matha - array, Vibhava, Antaryami and Aryavatara
 vishnu ke avtaron kii sankhya 24 maani jaati he, parantu dashavathar kii kalpana nitant lokapriy he jinaki prakhyat sangya is prakaar he-do panivale jeev, do jalathalchaari, vaaman, teen ram, buddha tathaa kalki - In the Mahabharata, 'buddha' has been omitted in Dashavatar and the number has been fulfilled by considering 'laughing' as an avatar
 bhagwat ke anusaar 'balram' kii dashavathar main gananaa hen, kyonki shrikrishna to swayan bhagwaan tehre
 They are avatars, not avatars; It is Anshi, not part
 shrimadbhagwat ke anusaar parameshwar prakruti or prakrutijnya kaary kaa niyaman pravartanadi kaary karte hai or maaya se mukt rahete hue bhi maaya se sambhddha prathit hote hai evam sarvada chitchktityukt hokar purush kehalaate hai jinase bhinn bhinn avtaron kii abhivyakti hoti he
 In this way, there are the differences of avatars - Purusavatar, Gunavatar, Kalpavatar, Manvantaravatar, Yugavatara, Swalpavatar, Lilavatar etc
 kahin kahin aaveshavatar aadi kii bhi charchaa milti he, jaise parashuram
 Thus, there has been substantial development in the number and noun of avatars
 uparyukt vivechan ke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki avatar vastut: parameshwar kaa vah aavirbhaav he jisamen vah kisi vishesh uddeshy ko lekar kisi vishesh rup main, kisi vishesh desh or kaal main, lokon main avataran karata he
 The imagery of an avatar has a strong origin in the Mahayanism of Buddhism
 'bodhisattva' karmfal kii purnataa hone par buddha ke rup main avatarit hote hai tathaa nirvana kii prapti ke ananthar buddha bhi bhavishya main avatar dhaaran karte hai yah mahayaniyon kii manyata he
 The Bodhisattvas reside in the heaven called Tushit, waiting for the maturity of their karmapha and when the right opportunity comes, they incarnate in the human world
 therwaadiyon main yah manyata nahin he
 a complete illustration of the Buddhist embodiment is available to us in the imagination of the Dalai Lama in Tibet
 tibet main dalailama awalokiteshwar buddha ke avatar maane jate hai
 According to the Tibetan tradition, a lama named Gradain Drup first gave birth to this fantasy, according to which the Dalai Lama was revered as a religious master and king
 aitihaasik drushti se lojung-gya-matso naamak lamas ne hi is parampara ko janm diya
 The Tibetan people strongly believe that after the death of the Dalai Lama their soul enters a child who is born around that monastery
 is main avatar kii kalpana maanya nahin thi
 Shangti, the first king of the Chinese people, was considered the ideal of virtue and virtue, but no allegation of divinity is found anywhere
 parsi dharm main anek siddhant hinduon or visheshat: vaidic aaryon ke samaan hai, parantu yahan avatar kii kalpana uplabdh nahin he
 Zoroastrians have said that Zarathustra Ahuramzd is not considered an avatar anywhere
 tathaapi ye log raja ko pavitra tathaa daivi shakti se sampann maanate the
 The power of the amazing Tej named 'hrenarah' was valid, whose residence was behind Ardashir Raja and Sasanvanshi kings, such a fantasy is often available in Parsi texts
 sami logon main bhi avatharavaad kii kalpana newnaadhik rup main vidyaman he
 The way Chudant resided with the king's physical power in these people, he was considered a complete symbol of divine power
 isliye raja ko devtaa kaa avatar maananaa yahan swabhaavat: siddh siddhant mana jaataa tha
 In ancient Babylon, we see the full development of this belief
 kish kaa raja 'urumush' apane jeevankaal main hi ishwar kaa avatar mana jaataa tha
 The king named Naramasin believed the blood of the deity to flow in him, so he had a picture painted on his forehead with horns
 vah 'akkad kaa devtaa' naam se vishesh prakhyat tha
 Egyptian recognition was also like this
 vahaan ke raja 'faron' naam se vikhyath the jinhen misri log daivi shakti se sampann maanate the
 The Egyptians also believed that the god named 'ra' coalesced with the queen and produced the Rajputra, hence he became supernatural
 yahudee bhi ishwar ke avatar maanane ke paksh main hai
 It is clearly mentioned in the Bible that God takes the form of a human being and sufficient examples of this are also available there
 unaniyon main avatar kii kalpana aaryo ke samaan nahin thi parantu vir purush vibhinn devon ke putrarup maane jate the
 The famous warrior Hercules was believed to be the son of Zeus, but the birth of the deity in human form on earth was not accepted in Greece
 islam ke shiya sampradaay main avatar ke samaan siddhant kaa prachaar he
 The belief of the Shia people that only the descendants of Ali and Fatima have the ability to become a religious teacher reaches the avatar
 'ima' kii kalpana main bhi yah tathy jaagruk ja saktaa he
 He is not only a descendant of Muhammad, but he also has the power of a divine person and this is the reason for his superiority
 aadharbhoot vishwaas he ki ishwar manushya jati ke paapon kaa praayshchitt karne tathaa manushyon ko mukti ke upaay bataane ke uddeshy se isa main avatarit hua
 Biblical inspection reveals how slowly the disciples of Jesus began to believe in their deity during their lifetime
 itihaas iskaa sakshi he ki isa ke maran ke pashchaat arthath isai dharm ke prarambh se hi isa ko purna rup se ishwar tathaa purna rup se manushya bhi mana gaya he
 The socialization of this early incarnational belief has become increasingly evident
 vastav main avatharavaad kaa nirupan vibhinn-vibhinn bhrant dharanaon ke virodh se viksit hua
 Following are the steps of that development: bible main avatharavaad kaa suvyavasthit pratipaadan nahin miltaa, phir bhi isamen isai avatharavaad ke moolbhoot tatv vidyaman hai
 On the one hand, Jesus is depicted as a real human being — his birth and childhood, the carpenter's livelihood until the age of thirty, the misuse and death, all of which are described in such words as the mind of Jesus in the reader's mind
 There is no doubt about it
 duusari ore, isa ishwar ke avatar ke rup main bhi chitrit hai
 In order to understand the education related to it, it is necessary to introduce the notion of the Bible about the nature of God
 iske anusaar ek hi ishwar main, ek hi ishwari tatv main teen vyakti hai-pita, putr or aatma; teenon samaan rup se anadi or anant hai 
 In many places in the Bible it is clearly mentioned that Jesus is the son of God, who is completely God like the Father
 pratham teen shatabdiyon main bible ke is avatharavaad ke viruddh koi mahatvapurn andolan utpann nahin hua
 The enforcement of many misguided streams must have happened, but none of them could remain popular for long
 pratham shatabdi main do paraspar virdohi vaadon kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya tha-ibeonitism ke anusaar isa ishwar nahin the or dosethism ke anusaar vah manushya nahin the
 Dosetism means seemingism, because according to this promise, Jesus appeared as a human being, but his humanity was real, just by seeming
 ukt maton ke virodh main katholic dharmatatvajna bible ke uddhran dekar pramanit karte the ki isai dharm ke sahi vishwaas ke anusaar isa main ishwartv tathaa manushyatv donon hi vidyaman the
 In the fourth century AD, Aryas made a successful attempt to formulate a new opinion about the Trinity and Avatarism, which caused unrest in the entire Christian world for a long time
 ariyas ke anusaar ishwar kaa putr to isa main avatarit hua kintu putr ishwariya na hokar pita kii sristi maatr he 
 In opposition to this education, the First General Assembly of the Christian Church declared - Father and son are essentially one ie both are equally God
 is mahasabha kaa aayojan 325 i
 main niseya naamak nagar main hua tha
 After Arius, Apollinaris proposed the doctrine of Jesus' imperfect manhood
 unke anusaar isa ke maanav sharir tathaa prandhari jeev tha, kintu unke buddhisampann aatma nahin thi; ishwar kaa putr maanviya aatma kaa sthaan letaa tha
 The General Assembly of Kustuntunia declared against Apollinaras in 381 AD that there existed an intelligent human soul in the real human body of Christ
 paanchavin shatabdi main kustutuniya ke bishap nestorius ne avatharavaad sambandhi ek nai dharna kaa prachaar kiya jiske falswaroop katholic giraje kii tritiy mahasabha kaa aayojan effesus main 431 i
 main hua tha
 According to Nestorius, there were two people in Jesus - one was a human person and one was a divine person, who was endowed with a divine nature
 at: ishwar manushya nahin bana pratyut usne ek swat:purna manushya main nivas kiya he
 The General Assembly of Ephesus deposed Nestorius and, in opposition to his teaching, declared that there was only one person in Jesus, the Son of God
 anadikaal se ishwariya swabhaav se sampann hokar ishwar ke putr ne maanviya swabhaav ko apana liya or is prakaar ek hi vyakti main ishwartv tathaa manushyatv donon kaa sanyog hua
 In response to the doctrine of Nestorius, some scholars have accepted not only the same person but also the same nature
 is vaad kaa naam monophisithism arthath ekaswabhaavvaad he; yutices iskaa pravarttak mana jaataa he
 According to this suit, after the incarnation, both the divinity and humanity of Jesus became such that a new nature, a new element was born, which was neither fully divine nor fully human
 dusron ke anusaar isa kaa manushyatv unke ishwartv main purnataya leen ho gaya jisase isa main ishwariya swabhaav maatr shesh rahaa
 Against this monotheism, the Fourth Mahasabha defended the traditional avatarism by holding that both divinity and manhood are intact and separate in Christ
 baad main ekaswabhaavvaad kaa parivartit rup prachlit hua
 This new suit, while accepting both the deity and manhood of Jesus, believed that his man was completely inactive, even he lacked human will
 isa kaa samast kaary kalap unki ishwariya ichhashakti se prerit tha
 In opposition to this view, a new General Assembly of Kustuntunia, proclaiming the complete manhood of Jesus in 680 AD, declared that in addition to divine will and activity, there was a separate existence of human will and activity
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki praarambhik avatharavaadi vishwaas kii purna raksha karte hue iske saidhantik sutrikaran kaa shatabdiyon tak vikaas hota rahaa
 Ultimately, it is believed that the Son of God has fully embraced manhood, so the same divine person combines the two natures - divinity and manhood
 unka manushyatv vaastavik or purna tha-ek ore unka sharir or uskaa du:kha vaastavik tha, duusari ore unki maanviya aatma kii apni buddhi tathaa ichhashakti kaa pruthak astitv or sakriyata thi
 Christian incarnation is often called 'incarnation'; In fact, it is the eclipse of mankind by God

 The main written evidence is a letter written by Anne during 1514
 yah usne netherland main shiksha puri karte samay england main rah rahe apane pita ko francisi main likhaa tha
 Ives argues that the maturity of the letter's style and handwriting proves that Anne must have been thirteen years old at the time of its creation, Warnick argues that many spelling and grammar errors suggest that the letter was written by a child Was

 During this period, on behalf of her father, she ruled the Netherlands and was so impressed with Bolin that she offered to keep her daughter Anne in her house
 Typically, a girl must be twelve years old to receive this honor but Anne may have been inferior as the Archduchess used to fondly call her "la Petite Ballin"

 Although all the information about Anne's experience in the French court is a conjecture, even Eric Ives has speculated in the latest edition of his best biography that there is a possibility that the sympathy of humanists and reformers from Margarit de Navar, sister of King Francis i He was introduced margarit de naivar apane aap main ek lekhika bhi thi or uske kaaryon main isai rahasyavaad or sudhaar tatv shaamil hai lekin frans ke raja kii pyaari bahan ke rup main suraksha ke kaaran vah apdharm ke kagaar par the
 He or his colleagues may have encouraged Anne's interest in improvisation, literature, and poetry
 Anne's education in France proved in later years to have inspired many new trends among the courtiers and women of England, and may have been instrumental in provoking the king into bargaining with the rank of Pope, contrary to culture
 In the latest edition of Eric Ives's autobiography it is assumed that Anne may have faith in Christianity and have a strong spiritual life internally
 William Forrest, author of a contemporary poem about Catherine of Aragon, congratulated Anne for her "excellent skills" as a dancer
 He wrote, "it was a young woman who could dance
 " Anne was extremely impressed with what she met, although there were differences of opinion about her attraction

" During this time, the Earl of Northumberland's son Henry Percy pleaded with Anne, and the two engaged in secret
 Thomas Wolsey's gentleman entrant, George Cavendish, says both were lovers
 is prakaar yah sambhaavna nahin lagati ki unka yon rishta tha
 The romance broke when Percy's father refused to accept their engagement
 According to Cavendish, Anne was sent from the court to the rural principality of her family, but it is not known for how long
 Upon returning to the court, she again served Catherine of Aragon
 pratishthit darbari kavi sar thomas whitebolin parivaar kii hiver kasal se judi hui riyasat ellington main bada hua
 White was estranged from his wife, and there are many unproven romantic legends about Anne, particularly in the writings of White's grandson
 It is speculated that White's most virulent poetry was inspired by their relationship and it is Anne whom he considers his sonnet Whoso List to Hunt, which he considers rare, obstinate, and king: "noli me tangere for Caesar's i am / And wild for to hold though i seem tame "
 1526 main, raja henry us par aasakt ho gaya or uskaa peechha karnaa shuru kar diya
 Anne opposes the king's efforts to attract her, refusing to become her mistress, often leaving the court and moving to solitary in Hever Castle
 Within a year, he proposed marriage, which she accepted
 donon kaa maananaa tha ki amaanyata kuch hi maheenon main praapt ho sakati he
 There is no evidence to suggest that they had engaged in sexual relationships or even been so close to marriage, in fact, Henry's love letters to Anne prove that their love affair in most of their seven-year courtship was physical

 airagon kii catherine pehle henry ke bhai arthur kii dulhan banane england aayi thi jo apane vivaah ke baad jald hi mar gaya
 Spain and England at that time wanted to consolidate their kingdoms and in 1509, Henry and Catherine married

 The Pope arranged for the convenience of the included dynasties that Leviticus was not issued by the Pope's legislation
 However, now, after these many years and with the arrival of a new pope, Henry again began to think
 Upon Catherine's inability to provide a successor, and possibly being instigated by Anne herself, Henry decided that no pope had the right to make arrangements against a biblical book
 iskaa matlab ki vah in sabhi varshon main airagon kii catherine ke saath paapapurna jivan bitaa rahaa tha, haalanki catherine ne iskaa kadaa virodh kiya or yah maanane se inkaar kar diya ki uski pehali shaadi shaareerik sambandhon dwaara purna hui thi
 It also meant that his daughter Mary was illegitimate and that the new pope should accept the mistake of the previous pope and invalidate his marriage
 Henry's tune for invalidation became known as "king's Great Matter"
 eni ne henry ke moh main ek avasar or suvidhajanak naitik asamanjas dekha

 Scholars and historians have different views about how deeply Anne's commitment to the Reformation was, how much she was probably personally ambitious, and how responsible she was for Henry's defiance of the Pope's power

 If Cavendish is to be believed, Anne's resentment over Vulce may also be personal whatever philosophical defiance she brought with her from France
 Furthermore, the latest versions of Ives' biography acknowledge that Anne may have undergone a spiritual awakening that inspired her, not only as a catalyst but as an administrator of Henry's Reformation Although this process took many years
 1528 main, pasinaa beemaari kaa prakope hua
 In London, the death toll was high and the court was immersed

 Henry sent his physician to Hever Castle to take care of her and she recovered shortly afterwards
 jald hi catherine se amanyakaran paane kii dhun henry par savaar ho gai
 Acting independent of Cardinal Wolsey, whom he had previously not informed of any of his plans related to Anne, Henry set his hopes on the direct appeal of the Holy See
 ki bul of pope julius dwitiya se vyavastha jhuthe daavon se praapt kii gayi thi, is aadhaar par catherine ke saath uski shaadi ke amanyakaran kaa mukadmaa karne ke liye raja ke sachiv wiliam nite ko pope chlemo saptam ke paas bheja gaya
 Henry also petitioned that in the event of becoming independent, an arrangement should be made that he could marry a new woman to any woman, whether in a close relationship, whether the relationship was legitimate or illegal
 iskaa spasht sandarbh eni se tha
 Since the Pope at that time was a prisoner of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, as a result of the Sack of Rome in May 1527, the knight had little difficulty reaching him
 Finally, he had to return with a conditional arrangement which Vulsey emphasized in technical Told as insufficient
 Now Henry had no choice but to hand over his Great Matter to Vulce who tried as best he could to obtain a decision in favor of Henri 
 woolse ne yahaan tak kiya ki england main ek carch sambandhi darbar yojit kiya jisamen baat kaa faisalaa karne ke liye khud pope kaa ek vishesh doot shaamil tha
 But the Pope had never empowered his deputy to take any decision
 pope abhi bhi charles pancham ke bandhak the or charles pancham henry kii rani catherine kaa vafaadaar bhatija tha
 The Pope refused Henry a new marriage until no decision was made in Rome but in England
 Convinced that Vulsey was a pope loyalist, not of England, many of Anne and Vulsey's enemies ensured his dismissal from public office in 1529, when Henry eventually consented to his arrest on grounds of loyalty to foreign authority
 Granted Had he not died of disease in 1530, he might have been killed for treason
 a year later, Queen Catherine was banished from the court and her rooms were given to Anne

 "on the other hand, Cromwell's biographer John Schofield argues that there was no power struggle between Anne and Cromwell and that" there is no indication of Cromwell's plot against Anne
 

 At the behest of Henry in the case, Cromwell appeared in the royal matrimonial drama
 cromwel ne vyabhichaar ke aarope nahin lagaae haalanki usne or anya adhikariyon ne eni ke khilaaf henry ke maamle ke liye unhen istemaal kiya
 Historian Retha Warnick questions whether Cromwell could have manipulated the king in such a case
 khud henry ne mahatvapurn nirdesh jari kiye, cromwel or adhikariyon ne unka anupaalan kiya
 Historians agree that the result became a legal derision

 Norris was arrested at the festival
 noris ne apane aparaadh se inkaar kiya or kasam khai he ki rani eni nirdosh thi
 The most damaging evidence against Norris was a conversation with Anne, heard in late April, in which she alleged that he often visits her in her room, not with servant Madge Shelton

 The four accused men were tried on 12 May 1536 in Westminster
 Weston, Brereton, and Norris identify themselves as innocent, and only the tortured Smitten confesses the blame and stands with the king
 Three days later, Anne and George Bolin are separately prosecuted at the Tower of London

 On Friday morning of May 19, Anne Bolin was judicially killed, not on the Green Tower, but on a scaffold built north of the White Tower in front of today's Waterloo Barracks, with a loose dark brown fur and The red colored patikot was worn under the folded jamdani gown of the Ermin mantle

 It is thought that he did not explicitly criticize the king to save his daughter and family from the consequences, but did not confess to the crime even under so much pressure but in his appeal to historians who would "investigate his case"
 Indicated to be innocent

 It is said that Cranmer, who was in Lambeth Palace, wept Ales Alexander by saying: "the one who was the queen of England on earth would be the queen of heaven today
" jab pehali baar eni ke khilaaf aarope lagaae gaye, cranmar ne henry ke saamne aashcharya or apana vishwaas vyakt kiya ki "vah doshi nahin honi chahie
" phir bhi, rani ke saath apni nikatataa ke kaaran cranmar ne khud ko asurakshit mahasoos kiya
 Before the night of the execution, he declared Henry's marriage to Anne invalid as if he had previously married Catherine

 However, on the day of her death, a Scottish friend saw Cranmer weeping bitterly in her London garden and heard her say that she was sure that Anne had now gone to heaven

 a direct example of Anne's influence in the post-reformation church is in which Elles Alexander described Queen Elizabeth as "the Christian bishop whom your Holy Mother appointed from among the scholars who are advocates of the pure doctrine
" " Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in many artistic and cultural creations

 An IPO issuing company can seek help from an underwriter company that helps them determine how to issue a surety, the best price of an IPO and what is the right time to release it in the market

 is 
 The IPO provides a large amount of capital to the company for future growth with the help of a wide stock market investor group
 company ko poonji waapas nahi kerani hoti he par nae shairdharak company ko bhavishya main hone vaale laabh par or company ke vighatan kii dasha main poonji ke bantwaare kaa adhikaar hota he The ratio of existing shareholders to the shares of the company will decrease, but they hope that the capital invested by them will increase

 That underwriter proposes to sell these shares to investors
 Goes near ipo kaa yah sauda kai roopon main ho saktaa he aam udaahranon main shaamil hai: a large IPO is usually underwritten by an association of investment banks, headed by one or more large investment banks, on the sale of shares, the underwriters get holdings based on the value of the shares sold
 However, the major underwriters, those who have sold the largest portion of the IPO, get the highest commission - up to 8% in some cases

 Initial devaluation of ipos serves to generate additional interest in the stock when it first comes into business
 It can be a source of significant profit for those investors
 Those who got shares at 'asking price'
 However, on devaluing the IPO, the company has to relinquish the capital that it holds to the stock Could achieve sales price adhimulyan kaa khatra bhi ek mahatvapurn vichaar he
 When a stock is presented to the public at a price higher than the market price then it can be difficult for the underwriters to fulfill their commitment to sell the shares even if they sell all the shares even if the stock falls in the first day's business
 It may lose marketability and value isikaaran nivesh bank bahut saare karkon ko dhyaan main rakh kar ek ipo kaa mulya nirdhaaran karte hai or ek aise prastaav mulya tak pahunchnaa chaahate he jo stock main dilchaspee jagaane ke liye paryaapt rup se nicha ho par company ke liye paryaapt poonji ikaitha karne ke liye paryaapt rup se unchaa bhi ho saamanytah ishtatam mulya nirdhaarit karne kii prakriya main hamidaar pramukh sansthagat niveshkon se shayaron ko kharidne kii patibaddhta kii vyavastha karte hai The company planning an IPO appointment appoints key managers who help it determine the fair value of the shayaron
 There can be two ways of pricing an IPO: either the company sets the price with the help of key managers or the book Building Pricing note: sabhi ipo delivery niptaan ke liye ditisi pranali ke madhyam ke paatr nahi hote hai, jisamen yaa to stock pramaan patr samashodhan bank ke abhirakshak ko saupa janaa hota he athwa vikrayakarta samooh dallali form ke saath supurdagee banaam bhugtan kaa tarika apnaanaa hota he yah jaankaree paryaapt nahin he

 In the ancient education system of India, we find mention of both informal and formal educational centers
 aupchaarik shiksha mandir, ashramon or gurukulon ke madhyam se di jaati thi
 These were also the centers of higher education
 jabaki parivaar, purohit, pandit, sanyasi or tyohaar prasang aadi ke madhyam se anaupchaarik shiksha praapt hoti thi
 It is mentioned in various Dharmasutras that the mother is the best master of the child
 kuch vidwaanon ne pita ko bachche ke shikshak ke rup main sweekaar kiya he
 As social development took place, educational institutions started to be established
 vaidic kaal main parishad, shakha or charan jaise sanghon kaa sthaapan ho gaya tha, lekin vyavasthit shikshan sansthaaen saarvajanik str par baudhon dwaara prarambh kii gai thi
 Gurukuls were often established in forests, groves and villages or towns
 wanon main gurukul bahut kam hote the
 Most philosophers used to live, study and think in the uninhabited forests
 valmiki, sandipani, kanv aadi rishiyon ke ashram wanon main hi sthit the or inke yahan darshan shastron ke saath-saath vyakaran, jyotish tathaa naagarik shaastra bhi padhaaye jate the
 Most gurukuls were built in a wag or vatila near villages or towns
 jisase unhen ekaant evam pavitra vaataavaran praapt ho sake
 This had two benefits; One, the household masters had the facility to collect material, the other Brahmacharis did not have to wander much in begging
 manu ke anusaar `brahmacharon ko guru ke kul main, apni jati waalon main tathaa kul bandhavon ke yahaan se bhiksha yachana nahin kerani chahie, yadi bhiksha yogya doosraa ghar nahin mili, to purv-purv grihon kaa tyaag karke bhiksha yachana kerani chaiye
 This shows that the Gurukuls used to be adjacent to the villages
 swajatiyon se bhiksha yachana karne main unke pakshpaat tathaa brahmacharee ke grih kii ore aakarshan kaa bhay bhi rahata tha atev swajatiyon se bhiksha-yachana kaa purna nishedh kar diya gaya tha
 Often, with the encouragement of the king and the feudal lords, scholars were attracted to their meetings and settled mostly in their capital, making them a center of city education
 inamen takshashila, patliputra, kanyakubj, mithila, dhara, tanjor aadi prasiddh hai
 Similarly, scholars were also attracted towards pilgrimage centers
 falat: kaashi, karnataka, nasik aadi shiksha ke prasiddh kendra ban gayi
 Sometimes the kings used to invite many scholars and settle them by giving land etc
 in charity and fixing their livelihood
 unke basane se vahaan ek nayaa gaanv ban jaataa tha

 are famous
 saarvajanik shikshan sansthaayen sarvapratham buddha viharon main sthapit hui thim
 Lord Buddha laid great emphasis on the education of worshipers
 is sansthaaon main dharmik granthon kaa adhyaapan evam aadhyatmik abhyaas karaayaa jaataa tha
 Ashoka made special progress of Buddhist viharas
 kuch samay pashchaat ye vidya ke mahaan kendra ban gayi
 They were virtually identical to Gurukuls
 kintu inamen guru kisi ek kul kaa pratinidhi na hokar saare vihaar kaa hi pradhan hota tha
 They were also accessible to the general public in terms of religious propaganda
 inamen nalanda vishvavidhyalay, vallabhi, vikramshila pramukh shikshan sansthaayen thim
 Following these institutions, the Hindus also opened schools in the temples which later changed into monasteries
 aalochay kaal main naariyon ke liye kisi prakaar kii paathshaala kaa pruthak-prabandh kiya gaya ho aisa varnan praapt nahin hota
 The Buddhists had arranged for the education of the nuns in their monasteries, but in the course of time there are no examples of that
 vastut: kanyaon ke liye pruthak paathshaalas na thim
 Girls who had the opportunity to study in Gurukul studied with men only
 uttarramcharita main valmiki ke ashram main aatreyi adhyayan kar rahi thi
 Bhavabhuti describes studying in Kamandaki's Gurukula in 'malati Madhav'
 kintu ye udhaaharan bahut kam hai
 Most Gurupatni, Gurukanya or Guru's daughter-in-law were able to take advantage of the study due to their stay in the Gurukul, in fact, at the request of the scriptures, girls were educated at home
 pracheen bharat main guru ke pratyaksh nirikshan main rahakar vidyoparjan shreshth mana jaataa tha
 Hence most of the students lived in the Guru clans
 guru jan apane ghar par hi vidhyaarthee ke awaas-nivas kii vyavastha karte the
 Food work was carried out by begging or arrangements were made in the teacher's house
 us samay ek guru ke paas ek saath praaia: pandraa se adhik vidhyaarthee nahin padhate the
 Sometimes only four students studied under a guru
 atev unke bhojan va nivas kii vyavastha karnaa guru ke liye koi kathin kaary nahin hota tha
 But being unable to manage the students of the Guru, the students used to manage their stay themselves
 adhyaapan kaary main vidhyaarthee se dhan maangana adhyaaapak ke liye atyant nindaneey mana jaataa tha
 The Guru could not refuse to teach even a poor student from poor
 jo guru vidya ke liye mol-bhav karata tha usko vidya kaa vyavsaayee kah kar hey samajha jaataa tha
 Such teachers were called unfit for Ritwik's work on religious occasions
 kintu guru ke padhaaye hue ek hi akshar dwaara shishy uskaa rini samajha jaataa tha
 Therefore, on the occasion of inclusiveness, the disciples used to give money to the Guru according to their strength in the form of guru-dakshina
 jo atyant nirdhan hote the ve guru kii gruhasthi main seva-kaary karke tathaa samaavartan ke samay bhiksha maang kar guru dakshina dete the
 In fact, it was the duty of both the king and the subjects to give free hand donations to learned masters and educational institutions
 pragaitihaasik kaal main saahitiyik tathaa vyavsaayik har prakaar kii shiksha kii vyavastha parivaar main hi hoti thi
 In such a situation, probably the only siblings and cousins have been involved and have been studying for the protection of the educated elders of the family
 kintu dhire-dhire vidya ke bhandar main prachur vruddhi ho jane se visheshadhyayan kii ore logon kii ruchi badhane lagi
 Therefore, it became necessary for the students to go to places remote from the family and study the desired subjects under the patronage of eminent scholars
 praaia: kanyaon ko bhi ucch shiksha praapt karne ke liye ghar ke baahar vidvan aacharyon ke paas janaa padataa tha
 But in this regard, very few clues are received from our texts
 uttarramcharita main valmiki ke ashram main lav-kush ke saath padhane vaali aatreyi naamak stri kaa ullekh hua he
 Which is a strong proof that co-education was propagated in that era
 isi prakaar `malti-madhav' main bhi bhawabhooti ne bhurivasu evam devraat ke saath kaamandaki naamak stri ke ek hi paathshaala main shiksha praapt karne kaa varnan kiya he
 Bhavabhuti is an eighth century poet
 atev aisa prathit hota he ki yadi bhawabhooti ke samay main nahin to unase kuch samay purv tak balak-balikaon kii sah-shiksha kaa prachlan avashya rahaa hoga
 Similarly, Puranas narrate the stories of Kahod and Sujata, Ruhu and Pramadvara
 inase gyaat hota he ki kanyaayein baalkon ke saath-saath paathshaalaon main padhati thim tathaa unka vivaah yuvati ho jane par hota tha
 As a result, Gandharvas were sometimes married
 ye samast pramaan is tathy par prakaash daalate hai ki us yug main striyaan bina parde ke purushon ke bich rah kar gyaan kii prapti kar sakati thim
 The existence of the co-education system in that era is also proved by them
 gurukulon main sahashiksha kaa prachaar tha, is dharna kaa samarthan aashvalyan grih sasutra main var nit samaavartan sanskaar kii vidhi se bhi miltaa he
 In this method, in the description of the follow-up action of the graduate, the embalming rites of the child and the girl are found to be completed simultaneously

 In the past, when a large number of women were getting higher education and increasing their pride of literature by making their invaluable contribution, some of them must have done teaching work at that time
 sanskrit sahitya main upaadhyaaya evam upaadhyaayani shabdon kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 Upadhyaya's wife has been reverently named Upadhyayani, but Upadhyaya has been used for the male students who used to do teaching work
 mahila shikshikaaon kaa bodh karaane vaale ek anya shabd kii rachana karne kii aavashyaktaa padana tabhi sambhav rahaa hoga jabaki mahila shikshikaaye paryaapt sankhya main rahi hon
 Apart from this, the pradapratha came into Indian society after the twelfth century, so there was no possibility of any kind of bonding in teaching work for women
 ho saktaa he ye upaadhyaayaayen keval kanyaon ko hi padhaati rahi hon athwa balak-balikaon donon ko
 Panini has also explained the difference between Acharya and Acharyani and has mentioned the schools
 isse bhi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki aacharyaayein in chatrishalaon kii sangrakshi-kaayen bhi hoti hongi
 Ramdas Goud has written - `` After the Harsha, the teaching work of women is also found in the seventh-eighth century
 shankaracharya se haar jane ke falswaroop apane pati mandan mishra ke sanyas le lene par ubhaybharti shringgiri main adhyaapan kaary karne lagi thi
 It is said that it was due to Bharati's education that the disciple of the monasteries of Shringeri and Dwarka became known as 'bharati'
 kintu phir bhi sthaan kii kami evam asuvidhaon ke kaaran adhikansh kanyaayein ghar par hi padhati hongi tathaa ucch shiksha praapt karne kaa saahas na kar paati hongi
 Probably, this is the reason why more details are not available in respect of these hostels and academics
 yadhyapi is kaal main maitreyi, gargi, vishwavaara evam lila-vati ke samaan ucch shiksha praapt mahilaayein thi, kintu isse yah nishkarsh nahin nikaala ja saktaa ki is yug main stri shiksha kaa paryaapt prachlan tha athwa stri-shiksha apane sangathit rup main vidyaman thi
 In this regard, L
 mukarji ke anusaar--`yah sambhav he ki is yug main striyon ke liye shiksha kii koi sangathit vyavastha nahin thim
 Probably when eligible degrees are received in the society, then the girls will be sent under their protection, but due to their not being available, they have to be forced to send daughters to the Acharyas to study
 jis kaal main gandharv vivaah samaaj main asaamaanya na tha, sahashiksha main kanyaon ke abhibhavakon ko koi aapatti bhi na rahi hogi
 But later, due to Gandharva marriage, the fear of moral degradation of girls started increasing
 atev log ghar par hi shikshak niyukt karke kanyaon kii ucch shiksha-diksha kaa prabandh karne lage
 The number of girls going to remote masters for higher education would not have been very high because there is no mention of girls going to Taxila for education
 isa kii chauthi shatabdi tak ladakon ke liye bhi saarvajanik paathshaalas na thim
 Harit has arranged that girls should be educated at home by father, uncle or brother
 isi prakaar manu bhi kanyaon ko purush shikshakon ke sarankshan main rakhkar ladakon ke saath adhyayan karne ke liye ghar se baahar bhejne ke paksh main nahin hai, kyonki sah-shaksha se kanyaon kaa kausaryatv nasht hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 Buddhists have the credit for making the first organized effort for women education
 buddha ne sangh main naariyon ke pravesh kii anumati de di thi
 The Buddhists had also made a satisfactory system of education for the nuns living in the Viharas
 brahmavadiniyon ke samaan inamen se bahut-si naariyon ne dharm or darshan gyaan ke liye brahmacharya paalan kiya
 Some of these also went to Sinhala country and gained special fame as great teachers of Buddhism there
 in viharon main ye naariyaan sahashiksha hi grahan karatin thim
 But even in these Buddhist sanghas, there was a complete decline of female education around the fourth century CE
 kitni pratishat chatraayen sahashiksha grahan karti hogi, is prashn kaa nishchit rup se koi uttar nahin diya ja saktaa
 But surely this number would not have been much
 vartmaan main vaidic shiksha ko badhaava dene ke liye baba ramdev ne acharyakulam kii sthapana kii he
 Baba Ramdev's purpose behind the establishment of Acharyakulam is to promote Vedic and Indian education
 acharyakulam gurukul paddati par aadhaarit gurukul shiksha ke saath-saath aadhunik shiksha paddati kaa ek awasaiya shaikshanik santhaan he, jo bharat desh ke uttarakhand rajya ke haridwar main sthit he
 Its most special thing is that till the 8th, 50 percent Vedic and 50 percent CBSE courses are taught here
 iske baad 8 veen ke 25 pratishat vaidic or 75 pratishat sibiesai kaa silebus hota he
 It is also the first school where English is taught to students as much as Sanskrit
 Recently Acharyakulam is associated with CBSE Board
 acharyakulam main aadhunik or vaidic shiksha kaa adbhut sangam dekhne ko miltaa he, yahaan ensiiarti ke paathyakram ke alaava teen period vaidic shiksha ke hote hai
 In this, knowledge of Vedas, Upanishads, Sanskrit, Yoga, havan-pujan etc
 is given
 pracheen bhartiya shiksha kaa itihaas sahasron varshon kii lambi avadhi main likhaa gaya he
 Therefore, it is very large
 smritiyaan sanskrit sahitya main parivartansheel ek vishisht kaal kii ore sanket karti hai
 Through him, a series of literary works from Vedic period to his own period have been foreshadowed
 atev smritikalin vidhyaarthiyon ke adhyayanarth vedon, brahmanon, upanishdon evam sutron ke kaal kii samast mukhya rachanaayen thim
 By the fifteen hundred BCE century, the work of editing most of the Vedic mantras was completed
 tatpashchaat vedon ke arth-bodh ke liye jin tikaatmak evam charchaatmak granthon kaa vikaas hua ve `brahman' granthon ke naam se pratishthit hue
 The genius of the scholars of this period was used to protect the nature of the Vedas and to clarify the meanings, not in the representation of new literary works
 falat: vaidic yagyon se sambandh anek siddhanton, matvaadon or ritiyon kaa vivechan `brahmanon' main hone laga
 Scholars especially made the ritual of yagyas the center of their spiritual practice
 parinaam swaroop karmkandon main jatilta evam duruhata aa gayi
 On the other hand the philosophical tendency of the Vedas developed and attained perfection as the 'upanishads'
 kalanukram se vedatirikt sahitya main bhi prachur vruddhi hui
 As a result, mastery in this continuous Vardhaman literature became beyond the ability of one person alone
 us kaal main mudran kala kaa vikaas nahin hua tha
 Therefore, the fear of the disappearance of Vedic literature was always there
 sahitya-suraksha ke drushtikon se adhyayan kshetra ko do bhaagon main vibhajit kar diya gaya
 Some of the Vedic pundits were entrusted with the task of making this huge literature as it is, thereby keeping the pure nature of literature intact and by studying the commentaries of other scholars, commentaries and dictionaries, etc
 An opportunity to show their talent in interpreting it
 Given
 is kaal main hindu megha kii sabase adhak nirnayaatmak evam rachanaatmak pratibha kaa pradurbhaav hua
 As a result, significant successes were achieved in the fields of education, philosophy, justice, epics, linguistics, grammar, astrology, nirukta, kalpa, many arts, practical learning etc
 in granthon ke vidwaanon ne apane vidhyaartheeyon kii sugamawa ke liye in vishyon kaa navinikaran karte hue unhen sakshep main ekatri t kar diya
 They were not written even though the Upanishads and sutras had knowledge of writing arts during the period, because scripting Vedic mantras was considered irreligious
 isi kaal main vaidic charnon ke aadhaaron par vidwaanon ne dharmasutron main ek naveen sahitya kii rachana bhi kar daali
 In view of the changing history of Sanskrit-poetry mentioned above, we can easily estimate its diversity and vastness
 smritiyon main is samast baiumay main varnit saamaajik ritiyon, dharmik karmkandon, evam sanskaron kaa surveykshan kiya gaya he
 In fact, the memories have been created by aiming for a large society
 smriti granthon main ham isi sahitya ke ullekh kii aashaa bhi rakhte hai
 Therefore, it has compiled pre-existing best practices, customs, beliefs and rites in the Grihyasutras, Dharmasutras, Upanishads and Mimamsas
 is kaary main jitani safalataa manusmriti ne praapt kii hai utani anya kisi smriti ne nahin
 Hence, only the subjects indicated in Manu Smriti are being mentioned here
 manu ne teenon vedon ko shruti kaha he
 These three Vedas are the first link in Sanskrit literature
 vaidic mantron kaa vikaas charnon ke rup main hua jinaki vaanchit shakhaon kaa gyaan purohit varg avashya praapt karata tha
 Mantra, Brahmin, 'rigvedi' reading the branch; The recipients of the Vedas, the 'ritviz', the scholar of all branches, and the learned Brahmin who passed through the Vedas, received special honors
 jo brahman teen vedon ke gyaata hote the unhen 'trivedi' kaha jaataa tha
 Some of the chiefs of the Vedas have been specially passed for study in Manusmriti
 vastut: is kaal tak dharmik kriyaaon env praayshchiton dwaara shuddhikaran kii prakriyaaon main atyant vistaar ho gaya tha
 Therefore, on certain occasions, the importance of the pronunciation of some of the verses of the Vedas also increased
 manu smriti main aisi richaon kaa ullekh karte hue kaha gaya he ki inkaa uccharan purna santulan evam niyam ke saath hona chahie jisase paapon se mukti paayi ja sake
 The Brahmins used the Angiras Shruti of the Atharvaveda as weapons to destroy the enemy
 snaatakon ke pratidin ke swadhyay paath main brahman granthon ke adhyayan kaa protsaahan diya gaya he
 Manu also mentions the mantras called 'subrahmanya' of Aitareya Brahmin and the Shunashep saga mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana and Bahru Brahma Brahmana
 armeik ek semitic bhashaa he jo madhyapurv or uske uttari-kendriya bhaag main pichley 3000 saalon se boli ja rahi he
 It is the language of many ancient Jewish and Christian texts and it is believed that the mother tongue of Jesus Christ was Aramaic

 armeik kii mukhya do shakhaaen hai : purvi armeik, pashchimi armeik
 The main dialects of the Eastern Armenian are
 : babylonian, beian, harnian evam siriak
 The Syriac is also called the Christian Aramaic because the religious literature of Christians is written in this Aramaic
 swayan isa bhi purvi armeik bolte the
 All of the above mentioned dialects of Eastern Armenian have often been exhausted
 isaki kuch aadhunik upbhaashaon kaa prayog mesopotemia ke kuch bhaagon main hota he
 Western Aramaic BC From the fourth century to the seventh century CE, the main and contact language of Western Asia and Egypt was
 pashchimi armeik kii mukhya upbhashaayen hai : pracheen armeik, bibly armeik, philstini armeik tathaa cemeriton armeik
 There are many religious creations of Jews in the Western Aramaic
 pashchimi armeik kii uparyukt upbhaashaayen ek prakaar samaapt ho chali hai
 Its later surviving dialect is used in a small part of Lebnam
