 Through his teachings, he has shown us the path of righteousness
 ab aap hamen apane tirthayatra kaa vrutant kahiye
 You must also have visited Dwarka in this journey, please tell the condition of our adorable Shri Krishna Chandra
 " On hearing these words of Ajatashatru Yudhishthira, Vidur ji narrated to him the description of all the pilgrimages, but thought it appropriate not to say the description of the destruction of Yaduvansh
 ve jaanate the ki yaduvansh ke vinaash kaa varnan sun kar yudhisthir ko atyant klesh hoga or ve pandavon ko dukhi nahin dekh sakate the
 Vidur Zhi happily stayed in Hastinapur for a few days

 The sage Mandavya cursed Dharmaraja, that is why he remained a Shudra for a hundred years
 ek samay ek raja ke duuton ne mandavy hashi ke ashram par kuch choron ko pakadaa tha
 The messengers, along with the thieves, caught Mandavya Rishi as a thief
 raja ne choron ko shuli par chadhaane kii ajna di
 Along with those thieves, the Mandavath Rishi was also put on the cross, but upon discovering that it was not the thief but the sage, the king took him off the pony and apologized for his crime
 mandavy rishi ne dharmraj ke pahunch kar prashn kiya ki tumne majhe mere kis paap ke kaaran shuli par chadhvaaya? dharmraj ne kaha ki aapane bachapan main ek tidde ko kush ko nonk se chheda tha, isi paap main aap ko yah dand mila
 The sage said - "I did that work ignorantly and you have committed a crime by punishing so harshly for the work done ignorantly

 With these words of Vidur ji, Dhritarashtra received Pragyachakshu and he went along with Gandhari that night to the forest with Vidur ji silently
 praatavkaal sandhyaavandan se nivruth hokar brahmanon ko tal, gau, bhoomi or suvarna daan karke jab yudhisthir apane gurujan dhritarashtra, vidura or gandhari ke darshan karne gayi tab unhen vahaan na paakar chintit huye ki kahin bhimsen ke katuvachanon se trast hokar athwa putr shok se dukhi ho kar kahin ganga main to nahin dub gayi

 On this question, Narada ji said - "O Yudhishthira! You should not grieve in any way
" yah sampoorn vishav paramatma ke vash main he or vahi sab kii raksha karata he
 Your understanding that i protect them is your mistake

 Then Vidur ji will go from there for pilgrimage
 atah tum unke vishay main chintaa karnaa tyaag do
 "after saying this, Devarshi Narada departed from heaven to heaven

 He was the last pope who assumed the name 'calixtus' after the election

 He greatly supported and benefited his family members in the activities of the Catholic Church, and perhaps because of this one of his nephews later became Pope Alexander VI

 Alphonse de Borha was born La Torretta, now a colony of the Canals municipality of the Valencian community of Spain

 He was the last pope to adopt this name
 inhen itihaaskaar atyaadhik dharmaparayan maanate hai, ek aise vyaktitv vaale pope jo holi si praadhikaran main drudh vishwaas rakhte the
 Like the second pope from the future Baurja family, he too went to great lengths to advance his immediate family
 1456 main inhone portugal ke liye paapal bul inter kayetre jari kiya
 By this bull, he reaffirmed Portugal's authority that he had previously received by Romance Pontifex and Dum Diversus Bulo, in which he had the right to enslave Kafiro and Muro
 arthath inhone africayo kii das pratha ko jari rakhaa
 By this confirmation of Románus Pontifex, he also gave Portugal the military honor Order of Christ under Prince Henry the Navigator

 In 1453 Pope Calixtus was urged to begin a crusade against the Osmani Empire, which had captured Kustuntunia, but his call did not find support among the Christian princes
 20 farvari 1456 ko pope ne apane do bhatijo ko cardinal padon par unnat kiya
 The first of them was Rodrigo de Borha, later to become Pope Alexander VI, who became notorious for his alleged corruption and immorality

 In this war, the Christians won a major victory against the Turks, and all the church hours were played in the afternoon in the victory of the English and Spanish empires
 is parampara ko aaj bhi catholic va puraane protestant giraghar smaranotsav ke taur par apanaate hai or dopaher ko girjagharo ke ghante bajaate hai
 In the joy of this victory, Calixtus declared August 6 as the 'festival of change', which is still celebrated by many Christian communities

 dhokhaa, chal, beyimaani, jhansa, ghabrahat or chaal sach manwaane ke aise tareeke hai jo sach nahin hote yaa puri tarah se sach nahin hote hai
 Deception can include pretense, publicity and hand cleaning
 iske liye dhyaan bhang, chal yaa chhipav kaa prayog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, you can also be deceived
 dhokhaa ek pramukh sambandhparak ulanghan he, jo sambandhit bhagidaaron main aksar vishwasghaat or avishvaas kii bhaawanaaon ko janm detaa he
 Cheating violates relational rules and is considered a negative violation of expectations
 zyaadaatar log doston, sambandhit bhagidaaron or yahaan tak ki ajanabiyon ke bhi hameshaa sachche hone kii ummid karte hai
 If people expect most conversations to be false then distraction and misdirection is required to gain reliable information from others
 kisi bhi din, yakeenan adhiktar log yaa to kisi ko dhokhaa dente hai yaa kisi se dhokhaa khate hai
 There is a considerable degree of deception between romantic and related partners
 dhokhe main sanchaar yaa chook ke vibhinn prakaar shaamil hai, jinase puure sach ko bigaada jaataa he yaa use chhipaane kii koshish kii jaati he
 Deception is in itself a way of deliberately handling verbal / or untold messages in such a way that the sender knows that the recipient of the message will accept it as true, which is false
 dhokhe ke sandarbh main iraadaa sankatmay hota he
 Intentional mistake and deception can be distinguished by intention
 parsparik dhokhaa siddhant aapasi sambandh ke bich dhokhe kaa pataa lagaati he
 The knowledge and behavior of the sender and receiver can be traced during misleading exchanges through the communication topic
 dhokhe ke paanch praathmik prakaar hai: There can be three main motives for cheating in close relationships
 sambandhit saathiyon main dhokhe kaa pataa lagaana bahut mushkil he jab tak ki ek saathi jabardast jhooth na kah de yaa spasht taur par jhooth bolkar chizon ko ulajhaa na de, jise doosraa saathi sach jaanata ho
 haalanki lambey samay tak saathi ko dhokhaa dena mushkil he, sambandhit jodon main rosemara kii baatcheet main hi andeh paidaa hota he
 Deception is difficult to detect because there are no reliable indicators to detect deception
 haalanki, dhokhebaaz par aksar mahatvapurn sangyanatmak boj rahata he
 The particular man or woman should remember the previous statements so that his or her story remains consistently reliable
 As a result, fraudsters often give important information, both literally and literally
 dhokhe kaa pataa lagaana bahut hi jatil he jo ki sandeshon ke vinimay ke sandarbh main sangyanatmak prakriya par aadhaarit he
 The doctrine of interpersonal deception holds that interpersonal deception is a dynamic of reciprocal effects that run between a sender, who manipulates information to distinguish it from the truth, and an receiver who attempts to establish the validity of the message
 Is an iterative process
 ek dhokheybaaj ke kaary sandesh ke abhigrahi ke kaaryon se paraspar sambhddha hote hai
 It is during this exchange that the fraudster will reveal the literal and nonverbal communication information about the deception
 Some research has found that some signals may be correlated with misleading communication, but scholars have often disagreed about the effectiveness of these signals as reliable indicators
 vikhyath dhokhaa vidwaan aldert vrij ne yah bhi kaha he ki aisa koi ashabdic vyavhaar nahin he jo vishisht rup se dhokhe ke saath judaa he
 As stated earlier, no specific behavioral indicator of deception exists
 haalanki, kuch ashabdic vyavhaar aise hai jinhen dhokhe ke saath sahasambaddha paaya gaya he
 Vrij found that testing a group of these signals was a more reliable indicator of deception than testing a single signal
 ek saathi ko dhokhaa dene ke mahatv ke bare main dharna ke sandarbh main, aam taur par dhokhe ke bare main mahilaon or purushon ke vishwaas ek duusare se bilkul alag hote hai
 Women see deception as a far more serious relational crime than men
 iske atirikt, saamaanya rup se purushon kii tulana main mahilaayein jhooth bolne ko ek kam sweekaarya vyavhaar kaa darja detii hai
 Finally, women consider any act of lying to be very important and indicate more negative emotional reactions to lies
 sach kaa purvaagrah sambandhit jode ke dhokhe kaa pataa lagane kii kshamta ko ullekhneey rup se vikrut kar detaa he
 In the context of deception, the bias of truth indicates a tendency to accept more messages as being true than false, beyond their true veracity
 sandesh kii sachai ko pahchaanane ke samay, sachai kaa purvaagrah ek vaastavik satya ke aadhaar dar se sambandhit satya kii vaastavik sankhya ke ek adhimulyankan main yogadan karata he
 The bias of truth is particularly strong in close relationships
 log dusron ke sanchaar par atyadhik bharosa karne ke icchhuk rahete hai or jab tak punarmoolyankan ke liye vaadhya kar dene vaale, vyavhaar ke ek mahatvapurn vichlan kaa saamana na karnaa pade ve apane saathi se sawaal nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 When detecting deception from an acquaintance or related partner, an attempt is made to take into account a large amount of known information about the partner
 This information is essentially a sign of the cognitive and deception of the recipient's deception
 Suppresses the ability to recognize
 ajanabiyon main dhokhe kaa pataa lagaana aasaan hota he, kyonki dimag main us vyakti ke bare main kam jaankaree laayi jaati he
 Camouflage of a physical object often works on breaking the visual boundary of that object
 isamen aamtaur par chalaavaran vastu ko aise hi rangon se ranga jaataa he jaisi ki vah prishthbhumi ho jisase vastu ko chipaaya ja sake
 dhokhaa dene vaale aadhe sach ke maamle main kuch satyon ko 'chipa' kar chalaavaran ko siddh kiya jaataa he
 Examples: chhadmavesh is prakaar kii upasthiti he jo koi or yaa kuch or hone kaa prabhaav paidaa karne ke liye kii jaati he, kisi prasiddh vyakti ke liye aisa karne ko chhadam vesh yaa bhes badalanaa bhi kaha jaataa he Examples: ek adhik sargarbhit arth main, ek alokapriy prerana yaa us prastaav ke saath jude prabhaav ko chhipaane ke liye kisi vishesh prastaav kii prakruti ko chhipaane kii gatividhiyon ke liye 'chhadmavesh' shabd kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 It is a form of political leaning or propaganda
 inhen bhi dekhen: prachaar utpaadan ke takneekon ke bheetar yuktikaran or hastantaran 
 Examples: udhaaharan: The simulation involves displaying false information
 anukaran kii teen takneekein hai: nakal or, jaalsaji or vikarshan In the biological world, imitation involves unintentional deception by any other physical formation or resemblance to a natural object
 udhaaharan ke liye pashu drishy, shravan yaa anya upayon se shikariyon yaa shikaar ko dhokhaa de sakate hai
 Creating something that is not really what it appears to be
 udhaaharan ke liye, dwitiya vishwa yuddh main mitra rashtron dwaara germany ke toh lene vaale vimaanon ko murkh banane ke liye gatte se bane khokhale tinkon kaa prayog aam tha, jo unhen kisi ek kshetra main ek badi topakhana ikai ke gatisheel hone kaa bhram utpann karaata tha jabaki asli tank kahin or acchhee tarah se chhipaae hue hote the tathaa "dami" tinkon se dur kisi anya sthaan par sakriy hote the
 Use some more attractive object as a bait and take one's attention away from the truth and remove it from the hidden object
 For example, a security company publicly announced that it would take a large ship of gold by one route, while in reality it would take a different route
 saamaajik shodh, vishesh rup se manovigyaan kii kuch kaary pranaaliyon main dhokhaa shaamil he
 Researchers deliberately mislead or misinform participants about the true nature of the experiment
 1963 main stanley milgram dwaara yojit ek prayog main shodhakartaaon ne pratibhaagiyon se kaha ki ve smriti or abhyaas ke ek vaigyanik adhyayan main bhaag lenge
 hakeekat main adhyayan pratibhaagiyon ke adeshon kaa paalan karne kii ichha par dhyaan de rahaa tha, yahaan tak ki, tab bhi jab ek vyakti duusare ko ksht pahunchaa rahaa ho
 The use of deception raises many problems in research ethics and is strictly regulated by professional bodies such as the American Psychological Association
 manovaigyanik anusandhan main aksar apane vaastavik uddeshy ke rup main pratibhaagiyon ko dhokhaa dene kii jarurat padati he
 The rationale for this type of deception is that humans are sensitive to how they appear to others and this self-consciousness can interfere with or distort them out of the context of a research Exactly how to behave
 For example, if a psychologist is willing to know the circumstances under which students copy in exams, asking directly, "how often do you copy?" Would result in a higher "socially desirable" answer
 There may be a percentage and the researcher may be unable to verify the accuracy of these responses under any circumstances
 shodhakartaaon ko "vishay se poochne" kii is prakriya se vah pataa chalata he jo chaatr "kehete" hai ki ve karte hai, lekin aavashyak rup se yah nahin ki ve vastav main kya karte hai
 In general, then, when it is simply impractical or simplistic to ask people directly why they do what they do, researchers use deception to distract their participants from the actual behavior of their interest
 Let's turn to to, udhaaharan ke liye, nakal ke ek adhyayan main pratibhaagiyon ko yah bataaya jaataa he kii adhyayan yah jaanane ke liye he ki ve kitne sahaj gyaan yukt hai or is prakriya ke dauraan unako apane uttar saunpane se pehle kisi anya pratibhaagi kaa uttar dekhne kaa avasar diya ja saktaa he
 At the conclusion of this or any further research related to deception, all participants should be told about the true nature of the study and why deception was necessary
 In addition, at the conclusion of the research it is customary to provide a summary of the results to all participants
 haalanki aamtaur par america manovaigyanik association apie
org ke disha nirdeshon ke anusaar or unki anumati se prayog kiye jane ke baad bhi is bare main bahes hoti rahati he ki manovaigyanik anusandhan main dhokhe kaa prayog karnaa naitik he yaa nahin
 Those who are against deception raise objections to the ethical and methodological issues involved in its use
 dreser ne dhyaan diya ki shodhakarta naitikta kii drushti se, prayog main vyakti kaa istemaal tabhi kar sakate hai jab vaktaa ne is vishay main suchit sahmati de di ho
 haalanki, apni prakruti ke kaaran, dhokhe par prayog kar rahaa shodhakarta vishay par apana asli uddeshy prakat nahin kar saktaa, atah apni sahmati de chuke pratibhaagi ko galat soochna di gayi hoti he
 
 Bomrind, criticizing Milgram's obedience experiment, argued that the deception experiment improperly exploited the trust and obedience given by the participant while the participant himself agreed to participate

 From a practical point of view there are also objections to the methodological use of deception
 ortman or hartwig ne mana ki "dhokhaa vyaktigat prayogshaalaon or peshey kii pratishtha ko jabardast dhang se prabhavit kar saktaa he, is prakaar pratibhaagi baavdi ko dooshit kar saktaa he" pri

 agar prayog main shaamil pratibhaagi hi anusandhankarta ke bare main sandigdh ho to ve saamaanya taur par jis tarah se vyavhaar karte hai vaisaa nahin karenge or shodhakarta dwaara kiye ja rahe prayog par niyantran kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he 
 Those who do not object to the use of deception keep in mind that there is an ongoing struggle to maintain a balance between "the need for research to solve social problems and the need for the dignity and rights of the participant in research" Christensen
 They also note that cheating is the only way to gain information in some cases and that banning deception in research "can have strong consequences when preventing researchers from doing a wide range of critical studies"
 iske atirikt, nishkarshon ke aadhaar par yah pataa lagata he ki dhokhe pratibhaagiyon ke liye hanikaarak nahin he
 a review of Christensen's literature found that "research participants do not feel that they are being harmed or do not seem to mind being confused"
 In addition, participants in deception experiments "report that they enjoy the experiment and receive educational benefits from it", while those involved in non-deceptive experiments do not

 The climax of Greek literature is found in plays whose center was Athens and the main language was "etik"
 greek naatak saarvajaneen jivan se sambandhit rahe or unamem mukhya bhaavana tathaa prerana dharmik thi
 The Greek grief originated with the kirtans and amodes held in honor of Dionysus, the god of Sura, in which priests roamed while singing with a goat's face
 in geeton ko "ditharaev" kehete the
 This later took the form of drama when the religious chorus was divided into two parts - the messenger of the deity on one side and his priest on the other
 yahi doot naatak kaa pratham paatr mana jaataa he
 By the beginning of the fifth century BC, the form of Greek drama had become well-formed and the three main pillars of the grief drama, the Ischilas, the Safocleys and the Europeans, tried to develop it during this period
 iskilas greek du:khant naatak ke pita maane jate hai
 He was a soldier poet, and his plays are accompanied by an oozing style of imagination and high patriotism and unwavering religious faith
 pradhanta kavyapaksh kii he or naatakeey tatv gaun he
 His plays related to Aristees and Primethys are particularly famous
 greek du:khant ke vikaas main kendriya sthaan iskilas ke safal pratidwandvi sifoklis kaa he, jinhone tisare paatr kaa samavesh kar naatakeey tatwon, visheshkar samvaad kaa dayera vistrut kiya
 His plays have an artistic harmony with human and supernatural elements, and his characters, such as Oedipus and Etigon, are, despite their extraordinary personality, full of human characteristics
 vaataavaran ucch vichaaron se prerit he
 The decline of ancient beliefs and the rise of modern attitudes are clearly mentioned in the plays of Euripidies
 dharmik shraddha ke sthaan par naastikta, adarshavaad ke sthaan par yatharthwaad, asaadhaaran paatro ke sthaan par saadhaaran paatr pathakon ke samaksh aate hai
 He was a foster of Karunaras and his dialogues consist of complex arguments
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is ardhshatabdi ke alpakaal main iskilas ne 70, sofoklis ne 113 or urapidij ne 92 naatakon kaa nirmaan kiya jinamein adhikansh lupt ho gaye
 The Greek joyous drama also originated with the worship of the god Dionysus, but this worship was not held in the winter but in the spring, and the procession of priests displayed the same arrogance and vulgarity as often seen on the occasion of Holi in India
 Comes in sukhaant naatak ke vikaas main dirian logon kaa mahatvapurn yoga rahaa, parantu iskaa utkarsh to etika se hi sambandhit he kyonki pracheen greek sukhaant naatak ke prabal pravartak aristophanij kaa kaaryakshetra to athens hi rahaa
 This fearless playwright created such melodious plays from 427 BCE to 40 years in which there are astonishing combination of the flight of free imagination with the melody of poetry, the intensity of inspection and the ingenuity of satire
 in sukhantaan main, "pakshi", "bhek", "megh", "raaten" or praaia: vyaktiyon par prahaar kiya gaya he
 Many of these include the intense derision of Socrates and his disciples' political and justice-related narratives, the politics of the perikalese, and his concubine, Aspagia
 kai sthanon par hasyaras ashleelata se pankil ho uthaa he
 Ancient pleasant dramas culminated in the medieval happy dramas of Greece, in which, instead of barbarism and personal satire, there was encouragement to the graceful farce whose characters were often symbols of various human classes and errors
 is naveen evam sukhaant naatak ke sajiv udhaaharan "platas" tathaa "terence" ke roman naatakon main milte hai
 Minander was its famous Greek promoter
 in sukhaant naatakon main nimnakoti kaa vaasanatv pradhan he
 Greek prose originated behind the verse, just like other literatures of the world
 isa purv paanchavin shatabdi ke madhya main greek gadhy tathaa padya ke kshetra ek duusare se alag hone lage or bahut se vichaaron kaa abhivyanjan gadhy ke madhyam se hone laga
 Famous Greek historians, Herodotus, Thucydidies and Xenophon Greek philosophers such as Heraclitus, Aflatun and Aristotle, and Greek eloquents and philosophers were heavily involved in the creation of artistic prose
 shastriyon main mukhya sthaan sophistaan kaa tha jo athens main vaktaaon kaa prashikshan karte the or apane kavy tathaa sangitamay gadhybhashanon se asaty ke upar satya kaa mulammaa lagaakar logon ko mugdh kiya karte the
 Aflatun protested against his harmful effects, and after that Aristotle made a scientific interpretation of this scripture and threw light on different styles of prose that his explanation is considered authentic till date
 aflatoon tathaa unke shishy arestu darshanik hone ke saath hi sahityasameekshak bhi the
 The talent of both was versatile
 parantu plato kii gadhyshailee saahitiyik he or usamen yathasthaan kavitv kaa sundar put he arestu kaa gadhy neeras vaigyanik kaa he jisamen kalapaksh gaun he vichaarpaksh mukhya
 Review literature of Europe for centuries considered Aristotle's poetry as sacred as the Bible
 arestu ke shishy theophrestras apni gadhyrachana "kairactors" ke liye prasiddh hai
 In the early third century BCE, Greek literature began to move towards the end of the period
 sikandar ke pita philip dwitiya ne unani swatantra rashtron kii satta par kutharaghaat kiya or sikandar ne swayan apni vishwavijay kii ugantarkari yatra main unani sahitya tathaa samskruti ko saarvbhaum banane kaa sakriy prayaas kiya
 Thus some centers were built outside Greece where the study of Greek language and literature began to be conducted in a new way but with great enthusiasm
 in kendron main pramukh mishra kii rajdhani alekjandria thi jahaan par unani sahitya, darshan tathaa vigyaan ke hastlikhit granthon kaa ek vishaal pustkaalay ban gaya jiskaa vinaash isa purv pehali sadi main general antoni ke samay hua
 The authors and scholars of this new center were influenced and inspired by the writers of Greece and their work was especially appreciated in the field of science
 parantu sahitya kshetra main srujanaatmak pratibha kaa sthaan aalochana tathaa vyakaran or vyakhya sahitya ne le liya
 As a result, along with the interpretation of old literature, it became possible to preserve the characteristics of many texts
 is kaal kii kavita main naveen tatwon kaa vikaas spasht he parantu use saath hi yah bhi prakat he ki kavita kaa dayera sankuchit ho gaya or kavita janata ke liye nahin visheshgyon ke liye likhi jane lagi
 The style became artificial and cumbersome, and in word-of-mouth also stood the boast of erudition
 kaviyon main mukhya naam he theocretas kaa jo dehati jivan sambandhi gochaaran sahitya ke strashta maane jate hai or apolonius tathaa kalimax kaa vishesh sambandh kramash: mahakavy or footkar geetkavy, jaise "eliji" or "evigraamon" se he
 Around the second century BCE, the Roman invaders came to dominate the country of Greece, but they accepted the importance of Greek literature and philosophy, and decided to be inspired by them to flourish their national literature
 yahi kaaran he ki roman samrajya ke vividh bhaagon main unani bhashaa kaa prachaar tha or isi bhashaa ke madhyam se sahitya ke vibhinn kshetron main prasiddh granthon kaa nirmaan ho rahaa tha
 The main place in this literature is prose which is the review
 samikshakon main sarvshereshth "lanzinus" he jiskaa prasiddh kintu apurna granth "shaleen ke vishay main" pracheen samiksha sahitya main aflatoon tathaa arestu ke granthon kaa samakaksh mana jaataa he
 This book discusses the decency of literature and mentions hundreds of works of Greece and Rome as examples
 sameekshak kaa sahitya prempragadh he or gadhy style main kavyachamatkaar tathaa ospurn shabdavinyason kii bharmaar he
 Another famous and influential prose writer of this period is Plutarch, who was born in the high clan of Baytia and gained considerable fame by living in Rome
 kanya kii akaal mrityu se prerit ho inhone "consolation" kii rachana kii jo kalantar main lokapriy hui
 Plutarch was a famous philosopher and a devotee of "apollo" and the last phase of his life was spent in literary service and devarchan
 inke lekhon tathaa bhaashanon kaa sangrah "morelia" ke naam se prasiddh he
 Plutarch's best and most eminent treatise is a parallel character of the Greeks and Romans, in which he proves his claim that parallel examples of each Roman are available in Greek history
 yah rachana sansar ke prasiddh granthon main gini jaati he or isamen aitihaasik tatv gaun hote hue bhi mahatvapurn he, parantu usase adhik mahatvapurn he charitrachitran tathaa rochak kahani kii vah kala jisane ise apane kshetra kaa amuly ratna bana diya he
 In this era, Greek prose literature created certain novels which are known as romance because their main aim is not to present the real form of life and the reality has died down by imagination and exaggeration and surprising events
 in romance kritiyon main jaise "tir kaa apolonius", dafnes tathaa clon yaa pastoralia-prem tathaa asaadhaaran ghatnachakra hi centresthal he
 Primody of the hero and heroine, then their separation and then wandering from there to the hurt of circumstances, finally reuniting and attaining unity in love is basically the essence of the main plot of these texts
 is yug kii greek kavita main moulikta tathaa sajivta kaa abhaas he or adhikansh kavyasevi saadhaaran shrenee ke hai
 But the mention of Lucian E
 will be of importance in this direction
 greek kavy main nae jivan kaa usne sanchaar kiya
 Lucian was born in Syria and Greek was not his mother tongue, but he studied the language with such love and dedication that it became his mother tongue
 isaki vishesh rujhaan darshan kii ore thi jisase prerit hokar usne apane jivan ke sunahale kaal 40 varsh kii avasthaa main athens ko kuch samay ke liye apana nivasasthaan banaaya tha
 But the philosophers' seriousness was against his temperamental fickleness, as a result of which he activated his writings in the rebuttal of contemporary philosophical fetters
 uski rachanaaon main "faloris" tathaa "mritkon kaa dialaag" vishesh ullekhneey hai
 The dialogue is full of satirical pictures and presents commentary on the bizarre exploits of mankind and provides a good life tableau of the descendants of hell
 in sabhi rachanaaon main dhanikon ke vyavhaar tathaa vicharon ke prati lekhak kii ghrinaa tathaa kadi aalochana swat: pramaan he
 Thus Lucian's genius was inspired by satirical bitterness and his satire was not limited to contemporary life
 unhone pracheen tathaa samakaleen sabhi dharmik andolanon kii kadi aalochana kii ore devataaon ke dialags tathaa seriyak devi ke prati jaisi rachanaaon main devataaon tathaa unke chamatkaaron kii bhi kaaphi khilli udayi
 In this way, Lucian was not only representative of the old trend of Greece but was representative of all its literature
 lesian ke saath hi clasical greek bhashaa kaa avsaan ho jaataa he or ek mishrit bhashaa uskaa sthaan grahan karnaa aarambh karti he kyonki uski mukhya prerana kaa kshetra hi badal jaataa he
 Along with Christianity, a new inspiration came into being in the Greek language
 greek carch tathaa uske aadhin bahari kendron ke netaaon tathaa santon ne isi bhashaa ke madhyam se dharmik tathaa aadhyatmik samasyaon tathaa bhaawanaaon kaa vivechan tathaa vishleshan karnaa aarambh kiya
 Some of the religious works are explanatory and didactic, such as "the Famous Papers of Sant Pal" and some are related to order and organization, such as "first Epsil of Clement", but are mostly explanatory, such as "epsil of Barnavas"
 in rachanaaon main sahitya tatv gaun hai, parantu alekjandria ke prasiddh carch-pita klement tathaa origen ke gambhir lekh vichaargarima ke saath hi saath saahitiyik style ke bhi prabhaavshaalee udhaaharan hai
 Historically the most famous book is "ecclesiastical History" written by Czera, which is the authentic text of the then church history
 madhyayugin isai lekhakon ne greek bhashaa tathaa style ke madhyam se pracheen unani darshan tathaa dharm sambandhi mul tatwon kaa saamanjasy apane nae tathaa pragatisheel dharm se sthapit karne kaa kram aarambh kiya
 As a result, many elements of the old style were reborn and the main doctrines of Aflatun and Aristotle found a respectable place in Christian theology
 is nai vichaardhaara ke prabal samarthak "bizantium" ke dharmik lekhak the jo greek sahitya tathaa darshan se purnataya anupranit the
 The same religious center encouraged songs that were sung on various occasions of worship and festivals in the church and are still known as "liturgi" and "snow"
 ye geetkavy puraani chhandaparampara ko chhodkar ek nai chand pranali kaa anusaran karte hai or inke bahm roopon main ascharyajanak bhinnata he
 But the language is so flexible that it becomes an appropriate tool for all those different forms without any special effort
 in geetkaavyon kaa sarvottam vikaas un shrinkhalabaddh dharmik geeton main hua jo "canan" naam se prasiddh hai or jinke sarvshereshth pravartak damishq ke sant jon the
 Such poems have been written for centuries and words and music are often interwoven in them
 iske saath hi ek or nai sahityadhara kaa aavirbhaav hua jiskaa sambandh isai santon ke jivan tathaa chamatkaaron se tha
 It is a blend of truth and imagination, and their authors seem to engage in the love and faith of moral and religious elements in place of worldly entertainment in the hearts of readers, adopting stylistic and thrilling narratives of medieval romances
 in lokapriy granthon kaa udgam sthaan mistra ke sat aathani kii "jeevanakatha" he jiske lekhak chauthi shatabdi ke sant athnasius maane jate hai
 The most popular parts of modern Greek literature are poetry, articles and poetry which were written in the common language
 vah bhashaa jo clasical ke vipareet "demotic greek" ke naam se prasiddh he
 Most of them fall under the category of folklore and are reflections of the ups and downs of folklore
 in geeton kii mukhya prerana loukik he or inke padhane se maharani elizabeth pratham ke swarnyug main prachlit un geetikavyon kaa samaran ho aata he jinamein javaani kii umang, prakrutiprem tathaa sura sundari main utkar lipsaa ke saath hi madhur pidaa bhi he jo bhautik sukh saundarya kii kshanbhangurta se aavirbhoot hoti he
 There are also some poems in this tradition whose importance is historical and the originals of the then accidents; For example, we can take those folk songs that mourn the downfall of Kustuntunia and express satisfaction over the courage and bravery of its defenders
 is prachur kavyasahitya ke saath lekhakon kaa vyaktigat sambandh nahin ke baraabar he
 It reflects the collective thoughts and feelings of the entire caste, hailed with folklore

 advanced towards the East in opposition to the Turks
 isi ke falswaroop prem tathaa saahasik kaary se sambandhit un romaason kaa janm hua jo madhyakaalin french upanyaason se prerit hai or jinka madhyam demautik greek he
 In the 17th century, this combination of two castes proved to be most meaningful in the famous cities of Crete, resulting in the emergence of a new type of drama which was inspired by Italian theater
 is sahitya main sarvaprasiddh naam kornaros kaa he jo naam se italian hai parantu bhashaa jinaki unani he
 In his popular novel called "rotocritus", he succeeded in giving a modern twist to medieval romance

 The late 18th century was a period of struggle for Greece's political awakening
 is jagritikaal main rashtrabhasha kaa prashn bhi vichaarneey tha
 Classical Greek, the pure language of the Vagantium, which was the language of the Church, and Demotic Greek, which was popular - was to form the national language using one of these as the basis
 is sangharsh main kai asafal prayaason ke pashchaat ant main lokprachlit bhashaa kii vijay hui or is vijay kaa mukhya shrey aadhunik greece ke sarvshereshth kavi "deonisiis ceylomons" kii hai, jinhone yah siddh kar diya ki bhashaa hi ucch koti kaa safal madhyam ho sakati he
 By the beginning of the 20th century, poetry and prose were written through this medium, which led to the substantial development and refinement of this language
 is shatabdi ke madhya tathaa uttarardh main kavy tathaa upanyaas greek sahitya ke vishisht ang rahe hai
 In this way, the history of Greek literature and language has remained virtually intact from a millennium BC to the present day, although the repetition of its ancient glory was never possible in later ages

 Given that t = 0 x = 1 { \ displaystyle t = 0 \ , \ , \ , x = 1} is avakal sameekaran kaa thik-thik hal t 2 + x 2 = 1 { \ displaystyle t^{2}+x^{2}=1} he
 We solve this by taking h = 0, 1 { \ displaystyle h = 0,1}
