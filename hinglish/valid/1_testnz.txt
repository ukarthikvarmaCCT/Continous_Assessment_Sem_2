 aise kulon kii sankhya prayek gana main parampara se niyat thi, jaise lichchhavigan ke sanghathan main 7707 kutumb yaa kul sammilit the
 Each of their clans had a federal title of king
 sabhaparv main ganadhin or rajadheen shashan kaa vivechan karte hue spasht kaha he ki samrajya shashan main satta ek vyakti ke haath main rahati he
 But in Gana rule, each family has a king
 
 Apart from this, two more things have been said
 ek yah ki ganshasan main praja kaa kalyaan dur dur tak vyaapt hota he
 Secondly, the condition of war is not safe due to war
 ganon ke liye sham yaa shanti kii niti hi thi
 It has also been said that in Gana, there is also appreciation of Pranubhav or the dignity of the other person and the person who walks with everyone in Gana is praiseworthy
 gana shashan ke liye hi parameshthy yah paribhaashik sangya bhi prayukt hoti thi
 Perhaps it was considered necessary that there should be organization of parties within the gana
 dal ke sadasyon ko vagrya, pakshya, grihy bhi kehete the
 The leader of the party was called Paramavagriya
 gansabha main gana ke samast pratinidhiyon ko sammilit hone kaa adhikaar tha kintu sadasyon kii sankhya kai sahasr tak hoti thi atev vishesh avasaron ko chhodkar praaia: upasthiti parimit hi rahati thi

 Apart from political questions, many other types of social, practical and religious questions also used to come for consideration in this meeting

 There is a history of fluctuations of republics in India for almost a thousand years
 unki antim jhalak gupt samrajya ke udai kaal tak dikhaai padati he
 The republics were merged by Samudragupta's military expedition aimed at the Tranabandhi

 Mahavir and Buddha not only immortalized the knowledgeable beings and the Shakas, but also changed the body of Indian history
 unke samay main uttar purvi bharat ganraajyon kaa pradhan kshetra tha or lichhavi, videh, shakya, mall, coliya, moriy, buli or bhagg unke mukhya pratinidhi the
 The Lichchhavis became the pillars of the rising kingdom of Magadha with their power and prestige

 Ajatashatru sent his minister Varshakar and sought to know from Buddha the way to win him
 mantri ko, buddha ne anand ko sambodhit kar apratyaksh uttar diya xxrep 5 - anand! jab tak vajgiyon ke adhiveshan ek par ek or sadasyon kii prachur upasthiti main hote hai; jab tak ve adhiveshnon main ek man se baithte, ek man se uthte or ek man se sanghakaarya sampann karte hai; jab tak ve purvapratishthit vyavastha ke virodh main niyamanirmaan nahin karte, purvaniyamit niyamon ke virodh main navaniyamon kii abhisrishti nahin karte or jab tak ve ateet kaal main prasthaapit vajgiyon kii sansthaaon or unke siddhanton ke anusaar kaary karte hai; jab tak ve vajji arhaton or guru janon kaa sanman karte hai, unki mantranaa ko bhakthipurvak sunate hai; jab tak unki naariyaan or kanyaayein shakti or apchaar se vyavastha viruddh vyasan kaa saadhan nahin banaai jaatin, jab tak ve vajjichaityon ke prati shraddha or bhakthi rakhte hai, jab tak ve apane arhaton kii raksha karte hai, us samay tak he anand, vajgiyon kaa utkarsh nishchit he, apakarsh sambhav nahin
 Buddha also made similar rules for his Buddhist Sangha established on the ideal of the Gana or Sangha
 jab tak ganraajyon ne un niyamon kaa paalan kiya, ve bane rahe, par dhire dhire unhone bhi raaj kii oopaadhi apnaani sharu kar di or unki aapasi foot, kisi kii jyeshthata, madhyataa tathaa shishyatv na sweekaar karnaa, unke dosha ho gaye
 The federations started fighting among themselves and became monarchies

 From Punjab and Sindh to eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, their status continued throughout the state

 But all was in vain, due to his policy of loneliness
 unamem mataiky kaa abhaav or unke chote chote pradesh unke vinaash ke kaaran bane
 While Alexander won him, Chandragupta, a representative of one of the same republics and his minister Chanakya, adopted a policy of abolition
 parantu samrajyavad kii dhara main samahit ho jane kii baari keval unheen ganraajyon kii thi jo chote or kamjor the
 Kul Sangh also appeared to Chandragupta and Chanakya as evil

 But these associations were exceptions
 ajatshatru or varshkaar ne jo niti apanaai thi, vahiin chandragupta or chanakya kaa adarsh bani
 The totalitarian form of the imperialist powers emerged and most of the republics merged under the vast unitary rule of the Mauryas
 parantu ganraajyon kii aatma nahin dabi
 Alexander's sword, Mauryan kills or invasive floods of Bakhtis and Shaka Kushans could only weaken the weak among them
 apni swatantraaa kaa har mulya chukaane ko taiyaar malloi, yodhey, madra or shivi punjab se neeche utarkar raajapootaana main pravesh kar gaye or shatabdiyon tak aage bhi unke ganraajya bane rahe
 They abandoned their ancient cities like Shakal and settled in new cities like Madhyamika and Ujjayini, drove their coins and conquered their Ganas

 However, this was only the last flame of freedom
 gupton ke samrajyavad ne un sabko samaapt kar daalaa
 Dhuitra Samudragupta, one of the headmasters of the Indian Ganas - the Lichchhavis - erased his name and forced the Malavas, Arjunayanas, Yudhyayas, Kakas, Kharpariks, Abhiras, Prajuns and Sunkaniks, etc
 to salute, arrive and obey
 unhone swayan apane ko maharaj kahana shuru kar diya or vikramaditya oopaadhidhari chandragupta ne un sabko apane vishaal samrajya kaa shasit pradesh bana liya
 It was ironic in the fate of the Indian republics that their relatives attacked them the greatest xxrep 4 - They were Vaidehiputra Ajatasutra Maurya prince Chandragupta Maurya, Lichchavidauhitra Samudragupta

 Like ancient India, the tradition of Greece was very ancient
 dorian kabeelon ne igian sagar ke tat par 12 veen sadi i

 Gradually republican cities stood up all over Greece
 athens, sparta, korinth aadi anek nagarrajya doria greek awaason kii qatari main khadey ho gaye
 They built their traditions, constitutions and ideals, many forms of democratic governance emerged
 praptiyon ke uplakshyaswaroop kirtistambh khadey kiye gaye or aishwaryapurna sabhyataaon kaa nirmaan shuru ho gaya
 But in his republics, the seeds of his downfall also remained hidden

 The so-called freedom remained in them, political rights remained in the hands of very limited people, the majority of the people were far away from political rights, did not even have civil rights and the system of servants and slaves proved to be a satire on those independent towns
 swaarth or aapasi foot badhane lagi
 Even when they fought among themselves, the kingdoms of Iran and the Macedonia broke up on them
 sikandar ke bhartiya ganraajyon kii qamar todane ke purv use pita philip ne greek ganraajyon ko samaapt kar diya tha
 The imperialism countered the municipalities of both countries
 parantu pashchim main ganraajyon kii parampara samaapt nahin hui
 Rome city of Italy became their center and later the origin of the very famous Roman race
 hanibal ne usapar dhaave kiye or laga ki rome kaa ganraajya chur chur ho jaayga par us asaadhaaran vijeta ko bhi jama kii ladaai harkar apni raksha ke liye hatana padaa
 The conquering army of Rome raided from Greece to England
 par jaisaa greece main hua, vaisaa hi rome main bhi
 The Romanians who conquered Greece in the military wars were defeated in the battle of civilization and culture, and Greece's indulgence flourished in Rome
 abhijaat kulon ke laadle bhrashtachar main duube, janavaadee paaharu bane or use samoochaa nigal gaye---panpei, sijar, antoni sabhi
 They began to drown in the subtlety, luster and aroma of Indian muslin, pearls and spices, and despite the screams of historians like Pliny, the gold of Rome came from the western ports of India
 rome kii ganraajyavaadee parampara sukh, saundarya or vaibhav kii khoj main lupt ho gai or unke shmashaan par samrajya ne mahal khadaa kiya
 Augustus became his first emperor and his descendants undertook to submerge all of Europe in their imperialist civilization
 par uski bhi ridh un hunon ne tod di, jinaki ek shakha ne bharat ke shaktishaalee gupt samrajya ko jhakazorkar dharashayi kar dene main anya patanonmukh pravritiyon kaa saath diya
 However, in spite of the newly rising kingdoms and feudal rule, the republics of Europe were reintroduced through charters and guilds
 nagaron or saamanton main, nagaron or samraaton main gajab kii kashmakash hui or sadiyon bani rahi; par antat: nagar vijayi hue
 The feudatories and emperors of their charters had to be accepted

 But they also ended with the rise of national ancestry

 Even further, republican sentiments were not abolished
 england anuvanshik nriprajya tha, tathaapi madhyayug main vah kabhi kabhi apane ko kamanbil athwa kamanwealth naam se pukaarata rahaa
 In the 18th century, the citizens there killed their king to protect their rights and the Commonwealth or Republic was established
 pun: rajtantr aayaa par ganatantratmak bhavanaayen jari raheen, raja janata kaa kripapaatr, khilonaa ban gaya or kabhi bhi uski aseemit shakti sthapit na ho saki
 The battle of human officers continued and the English colonies of America won the war against England and included those rights in their declaration of independence
 france kii praja bhi aage badi; ekta, swatantraaa or bandhutav ke naare lage, rajtantr dhah gaya or kranti ke falswaroop prajatantr kii sthapana hui
 Napoleon swam on the flood of those feelings, France itself was once again in the grip of an autocratic monarchy for a few days, but the other countries of Europe and beyond also rose a sea of independent feelings
 19veen sadi ke madhya se krantiyon kaa yug pun: prarambh hua or koi bhi desh unase achoota na bachaa
 Monarchies were abolished and republics were established

 Influenced by Marxism in 1917, there was a state revolution in Russia and the Tsarist was abolished

 Both these countries call themselves republics, and their governance is done in the name of the people
 parantu unamem janawaad kii dori khinchnewale haath adhinayakawadi hi hai
 By breaking centuries of slavery, India too is determined to carry on the tradition of the Republic and has created a democratic constitutional system for itself
 samrajyon or samraaton ke namonishaan mit chuke hai tathaa nirkunsh or aseemit rajyavyavasthaayen samaapt ho chuki hai, kintu swatantraaa kii vah mul bhaavana maanavhruday se nahin dur kii ja sakati jo ganraajya parampara kii kunjee he
 Today's republics like the ancient era of world history are neither very small in the region nor suffer from divisions and hostility
 unamem na to pracheen greece kaa dasavaad he or na pracheen or madhyakaalin bharat or europe ke ganraajyon kaa simit matdaan
 The entire public has now become the chief among them and it is the legislature of its fate
 sainik adhinayakawadi bhi vivash hokar janawaad kaa dam bharte or kabhi kabhi uske liye kaary bhi karte hai
 The spirit of the Republic is immortal and its democracy will always be immortal

 Also, banyan and peepal trees around this pond made it even more relevant for relaxation

 directly under the Maharaja
 isi kaaran ham maan sakate hai ki marwar rajya ke liye is gram kaa mahattav kinchit adhik rahaa tha

 rasochikitsa yaa rasy chikitsa yaa rasayan chikitsa yaa chemotherapy ek aisa aushadhiy upachaar he jo cancer kii koshikaon ko nasht karne ke liye diya jaataa he
 The term chemotherapy is made up of two words - chemical means chemotherapy and therapy
 ksi ko kis prakaar kii chemotherapy di jaae, iskaa nirnay is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki aapako kis prakaar kaa cancer he
 Chemotherapy may also be given alone or with surgery or radiotherapy
 chemotherapy anek tareekon se di ja sakati he, ise dene kii sabase aam vidhiyaan hai- Depending on your treatment, it can be given at various intervals, such as daily, weekly, every two / three weeks or continuously

 The number of white cells, red cells and platelets will be seen in these investigations
 yadi chemotherapy upachaar dwaara aapaki safed koshikaayen ghat gai hai, to aapkesharir main sankraman se ladne kii kshamta kam ho jaaegi
 One way to know if you have an infection is to increase your body temperature
 yadi aapke sharir kaa taapmaana 37
5 degree celsius yaa usase adhik he, athwa aapako gale main ghaav hone, khaansee, zukam yaa dast jaise sankraman ke koi bhi lakshan najar aate hai, to aapako turant doctor se sampark karnaa chahie

 If these are reduced, you may experience fatigue and yellowing, which is known as blood deficiency
 yadi aapaki laal koshikaayen saamaanya str se neeche hai, to aapako khun chadhvane kii jarurat pad sakati he
 These cells bind the blood flow, for example, when one of your organs is cut a little, these cells bind the blood flow
 yadi chemotherapy ke kaaran aapaki platelets bahut kam ho gai hai to aap dekhge ki aapako aasaani se kharonchen lag jaati hai, athwa aapaki naak yaa masoodon se khun bahata he
 If your platelets numbers are below normal levels, you may need to mount platelets, otherwise we may have to postpone your treatment for some time

 masoodon se shuru karte hue neeche kii ore brush karte hue apane daanton ko komalta se saaf karen

 They should be soaked in water overnight and you should use a bactericidal solution once a week to disinfect them
 apane munh ko taazgi dene or nam rakhane ke liye adhik se adhik maatra main drav padaarth pien
 Cleaning your mouth with salt water can also be beneficial for you
 yadi aapako namak kaa prayog karnaa pasand nahin he to aap taaje pani se bhi aisa kar sakate hai

 vah aapako koi aisa upaay bataa saktaa he jisase aapako dard se raahat mil sake
 Sometimes chemotherapy treatment can affect your appetite

 Some chemotherapy drugs can cause hair thinning, or unfortunately in some cases complete hair loss may occur
 yah samasya hameshaa asthai hoti he or aapkaa chemotherapy upachaar puraa hone par aapke bal punah waapas aa jaaenge
 Scalp cooling can be used for some types of chemotherapy treatments to reduce hair loss
 aisi koi vajah nahin he ki sambhog se parhez kiya jaae, lekin ham condom istemaal karne kii salaah dete hai
 It is possible that some part of the chemotherapy is in the fluid coming out of your body, so in this case the use of condoms will protect your partner
 yah jaruri he ki apane upachaar ke dauraan athwa upachaar ke baad kam se kam chah maheene tak aap garbhadhaaran na karen yaa yadi aap purush hai to apane saathi ko garbhvatee hone den
 The reason for this is that chemotherapy can be harmful for the child

 This problem can be temporary as well as permanent
 chemotherapy kii kuch aushadhiyaan aapaki twachaa ko dhoop ke prati or adhik samvedansheel bana sakati hai

 Chemotherapy can make you feel more tired than you usually do
 yah jaruri he ki aap apane sharir kii jarurat kaa dhyaan rakhen or yadi aapako aaraam kii jarurat ho to aaraam karen, lekin yadi aapako lagata he ki aap saamaanya rup se kaamkaaj karne main sakasham hai to aisa jarur karen
 Some people find it beneficial to do light exercise as well as rest
 chemotherapy kii kuch aushadhiyaan, jo drip main yaa sui dwaara di jaati hai, agar aapaki nas ke baahar ris jaaen to twachaa or uske aas-paas ke kshetra ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati hai
 This happens only in very rare situations, but it is important that you inform your nurse immediately about the place where you feel a drip, if you feel pain or irritation there
 aapke upachaar ke kai dinon baad tak aapke sharir ke drav padaarthon main kuch ansh main chemotherapy ke tatv maujuud ho sakate he
 Although the risk of harm from this is very low, it is important that others are exposed to chemotherapy
 isliye hamaari yah salaah he ki aap toilet kaa istemaal karne ke turant baad pani chalaa den or apane haath acchhee tarah se dhoen
 You should wear rubber gloves if the body fluids have spread or your hands are stuck on them
 chemotherapy upachaar karaane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap apane parivaar or doston ke saath kareebi sambandh nahin rakh sakate
 This includes kissing and hugging
 chemotherapy karaane vaale sabhi rogiyon ko flu hone kaa khatra hota he
 If you are undergoing chemotherapy in the autumn or winter, then you are advised against immunization from the flu
 uchit yah hoga ki aap apana chemotherapy upachaar shuru hone ke 7-10 din pehle hi tikaa lagava len
 If your chemotherapy has started, your immunity may not be as good as your response to immunity is likely to decrease
 isse aapkesharir kii rogapratikaarak paidaa karne kii kshamta ghatati he, jo aapako flu se bachaane ke liye jaruri hai
 If you get vaccinated during chemotherapy, you should do so only when your white cell count falls to normal levels
 yadi aapaki safed koshikaon kii sankhya kam he to aapako tikaa lagavane se bachanaa chahie kyonki aisa karne se aapke sharir kaa taapmaana bad saktaa he
 This can lead to a misunderstanding that you have a fever due to infection and as a result you may have to be treated unnecessarily in a hospital
 chemotherapy karaane ke dauraan yadi aap ghar par aswasth mahasoos karen or aapako yah lage ki aisa chemotherapy kii vajah se ho rahaa he to aapako hamen turant sampark karnaa chahie

 shabd ko palatakar padhane se taiyaar honevaala shabd ko us shabd kaa 'vyutkram lafj yaa shabd' kehete hai
 For example - 1
 Inverse word of 'force' - 'lab' 2
 'kaam' kaa vyutkram shabd 'makka' Here, after reading 'kama', you get "maca"
 "maka" yah sarthak shabd nahin hai kintu uccharan main uske jaisaa "makka" yah sarthak shabd hai
 Hence we can call the word "maize" here the inverse of 'kama'
 3
 'kah' kaa vyutkram shabd 'haq' The word and the meaningful word prepared by reading it back and forth, where both these words are used, there are 'inverse decking'
 vyutkram alankaar main shabd or uske 'vyutkram shabd' kaa prayog kiya jaataa hai

 lab kahata kar lo mujh pe kaabo So it will become a force
 - yahan par lab or usko palat ke milanevaala shabd yani kii bal in donon kaa prayog kiya hai
 Hence there are 'inverse syllables' here
