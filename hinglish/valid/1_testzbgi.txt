 Three important texts were written in the seven centuries up to 1920 before the birth of modern literature - the history of the mystery of Mongolia, the story of Gezer Khan and the city "mongolia ke rahasy kaa itihaas" sheershak granth main mongol jati ke janm se lekar chinagis khan tak kaa itihaas he or chinagis khan par vishesh bal diya gaya he
 It is written in very simple and beautiful language and poems are also mixed in between

 kohinoor ek 105 carat kaa hira he jo kisi samay vishwa kaa sabase bada gyaat hira rah chukaa he
 This diamond is said to have been extracted from the Golconda mine in India
 'kohinoor' kaa arth he- abha yaa roshni kaa parvat
 This took place through several Mughal and Persian rulers, eventually taken over by British rule, and joined their treasury, when British Prime Minister, Benjamin digraeli, declared Queen Victoria the Emperor of India in 1877
 anya kai prasiddh jawaharaaton kii bhaanti hi, kohinoor kii bhi apni kathaayen rahi hai
 According to this belief, it became the cause of misfortune and death of male owners, and brought good luck for female owners
 anya manyata ke anusaar, kohinoor kaa swami sansar par rajya karne vaala bana
 Its origin is not clear
 dakshin bharat main, hiron se judi kai kahaniyaan raheen hai, parantu koun si isaki he, kahana mushkil he
 According to several sources, the Kohinoor diamond was found around 5000 years ago and it was famous as the name Syamantaka Mani as written in ancient Sanskrit history
 hindu kathaon ke anusaar, bhagwaan shrikrishna ne swayan yah mani, jambavant se lee thi, jisaki putree jamvanti ne baad main shri krishna se vivaah bhi kiya tha
 Sri Krishna stole this gem while Jamwant was sleeping
 ek anya katha anusaar, yah hira nadi kii tali main mila tha, lagbhag 3200 i
pus

 According to historical evidence, it originated from the Golconda mine, which is one of the best ancient mines in the world, in Andhra Pradesh
 san 1730 tak yah vishwa kaa ekmaatr hira utpaadak kshetra gyaat tha
 After this, diamonds were discovered in Brazil
 shabd golkunda hira, atyadhik shwet varna, spashtataa va ucch koti kii paardarshita he liye prayog kii jaati rahi he
 They are extremely rare, so precious
 is heere ke bare main, dakshin bhartiya katha, kuch pukhta lagati he
 It is possible that Heera, the Kollar mine of Andhra Pradesh, which is presently in Guntur district, came out there
 dilli sultanate main khilji vansh kaa ant 1320 main hone ke baad giasuddin tughlaq ne gaddi sanbhali thi
 He sent his son Ulugh Khan in 1323 to defeat King Prataparudra of the Kakatiya dynasty
 is hamale ko kadi takkar mili, parantu ulugh khan ek badi sena ke saath phir lautaa
 For this, the unexpected king was defeated in the battle of Warangal
 tab warangal kii lut-paat, tod-phod va hatya-kand maheenon chali
 Abundance of gold and silver and ivory was found, which was taken to Delhi on elephants, horses and camels
 kohinoor hira bhi us lut kaa bhaag tha
 From here, this diamond was put in the hands of the heirs of the Delhi Sultanate in 1526 by the Mughal emperor Babur
 is heere kii pratham drushtya pakki tippanee yaheen san 1526 se milti he
 Babur has written in his Baburnama, that this diamond belonged to a king of Malwa in 1294
 babar ne iskaa mulya yah aanka, ki puure sansar ko do dinon tak pet bhar sake, itnaa mahangaa
 In Baburnama, how the king of Malwa was forced to give this legacy to Alauddin Khilji
 uske baad yah dilli sultanate ke uttaradhikariyon dwaara aage badhaayaa gaya or antatah 1526 main, babar kii jeet par use praapt hua
 Although Baburnama was written in 1526–30, its sources are not known
 usne is heere ko sarvada iske vartmaan naam se nahin pukaara he
 Rather, after a controversy, it was concluded that Babur's diamond was later called Kohinoor
 babar evam humayu, donon ne hi apni aatmakathaaon main, babar ke heere ke udgam ke bare main likhaa he
 This diamond was earlier with the Kachwaha rulers of Gwalior, from whom it reached the Tomar kings
 antim tomars vikramaditya ko sikandar lodhi ne haraaya, va apane adheen kiya, tathaa apane saath dilli main hi bandi bana kar rakhaa
 After Lodhi was defeated by the Mughals, the Mughals plundered his property, but Prince Humayun meddled and got his property back, but instead liberated him and took refuge in Mewar, Chittor
 humayu kii is bhalaai ke badale vikramaditya ne apana ek bahumoolya hira, jo shaayad kohinoor hi tha, humayu ko saabhaar de diya
 But Humayun's life was very unfortunate
 vah shershah suri se haar gaya
 Suri also died by burning with a cannonball
 uskaa putr va uttaradhikari jalaal khan apane saale dwaara hatya ko praapt hua
 That brother-in-law was also overthrown by one of his ministers
 vah mantri bhi ek yuddh ko jitate jitate aankh main chot lag jane ke kaaran haar gaya, va sltanat kho baitha
 Humayun's son Akbar never kept this gem with him, which later went directly to Shah Jahan's treasury
 shahjahan bhi apane bete aurangzeb dwaara takhtapalat kar bandi banaaya gaya, jisane apane anya teen bhaaiyon kii hatya bhi kii thi
 Shah Jahan rooted Kohinoor in his famous Peacock-throne
 uske putr aurangzeb ne apane pita ko kaid karke agra ke kile main rakhaa
 It is also a legend that he placed the Kohinoor near the window in such a way that, inside it, Shah Jahan could see the image of the Taj Mahal
 kohinoormugalo ke paas 1739 main hue irani shaasha nadir shah ke akraman tak hi rahaa
 He looted fiercely in Agra and Delhi
 vah mayur singhaasana sahit kohinoor va agaadh sampatti faras lut kar le gaya
 On receiving this diamond, Nadir suddenly left the face of Shah: koh-i-noor, from which it got its current name
 1739 se purv, is naam kaa koi bhi sandarbh gyaat nahin he
 Kohinoor's assessment comes from a legend by Nadir Shah
 uski rani ne kaha tha, ki yadi koi shaktishaalee maanav, paanch pattharon ko chaaron dishaao, va upar kii ore, puri shakti sahit phenke, to unke bich kaa khaali sthaan, yadi suvarna va ratnon maatr se hi bharaa jaye, unke baraabar isaki keemat hogi
 In 1747, after the assassination of Nadir Shah, it passed into the hands of Ahmed Shah Abdali of Afghanistan
 1830 main, shuja shah, afghanistan kaa tatkaaleen padchyut shaasha kisi tarah kohinoor ke saath, batch niklaa; va punjab pahunchaa, va vahaan ke maharaja ranjit singh ko yah hira bhent kiya
 In its replacement, Ranjit Singh had prepared the East India Company to send its troops to Afghanistan, win the Afghan throne and bring back Shah Shuja
 ranjit singh, ne swayan ko punjab kaa maharaja ghoshit kiya tha
 In 1839, on his death bed, he wrote to Kohinoor to donate to Puri, Odisha famous Sri Jagannath, temple
 kintu uske antim shabdon ke bare main vivaad uthaa or antatah vah puure naa ho sake
 On March 29, 1849, hoisted the British flag at the Lahore Fort
 is tarah punjab, british bharat kaa bhaag ghoshit hua
 An important part of the Treaty of Lahore was as follows: "the jewel named koh-i-noor, taken from Maharaja Ranjit Singh from shah-shuja-ul-mulk, will be handed over to the Queen of England by the Maharaja of Lahore
 " The Governor General was in charge of this treaty, Lord Dalhousie, whose desire to acquire the Kohinoor was one of the main reasons for this treaty
 inke bharat main kaary, sadaa hi vivaad grast rahe, va kohinur arjan kaa krity, bahut se british tikaakaron dwaara, aalochit kiya gaya he
 However, some even proposed that diamonds should have been presented directly to the Queen, rather than being snatched away; But Dalhazi considered it a reward for war, and saved it in the same way
 baad main, dalhauzi ne, 1851 main, maharaja ranjit singh ke uttaradhikari dalip singh dwaara maharani victoria ko bhent kiye jane ke prabandh kiye
 Thirteen years old, Dalip traveled to England, and met him
 yah bhent, kisi ratna ko yuddh ke maal ke rup main sthanantaran kiye jane kaa antim drushtaant tha
 In 1851, at a huge exhibition in Hyde Park, London, it was shown to the British public
 ratna ke kataav main kuch badlaav hue, jinase vah or sundar prathit hone laga
 In 1852, in the presence of Victoria's husband Prince Albert, the diamond was cut again, reducing it from 186 1 / 6 carats to 105
602 carats, but its aura increased manifold
 albert ne budhimata kaa parichay dete hue, acchhee salahon ke saath, is kaary main apana ativ prayaas lagaaya, saath hi tatkaaleen 8000 pound bhi, jisase is ratna kaa bhaar 42% ghat gaya, parantu albert phir bhi asantusht the
 Diamonds were inlaid with another two thousand diamonds in the crown
 baad main, ise maharaja kii patni ke kirit kaa mukhya ratna jadaa gaya
 Queen Alexandria was the first queen to use it
 inke baad maharani mairi thim
 In 1936, it was crowned by Queen Elizabeth's crown
 2002 main, ise unke taabut ke upar sajaayaa gaya
 The story of 'kohinoor', the world's rarest and most prized diamond, reaching the crown of the Queen of Britain extends from the Kurukshetra of Mahabharata to the poor laborer's hut of Golconda
 britain kii maharani ke taj main jadaa or duniya ke anek baadshahon ke dilon ko lalachaane kii kshamta rakhane vaala anokhaa kohinoor duniya main aakhir kahan se aayaa, is bare main aitihaasik ghatnaon ke alaava bahut si kathaayen or kinvadantiyaan bhi prachlit hai
 This diamond has been a witness to many wars, intrigues, greed, bloodshed and victory
 duniya ke sabhi hiron kaa raja he kohinoor hira
 Its story is also no less exciting than fairy tales
 kohinoor ke janm kii pramanit jaankaree nahin he par kohinoor kaa pehla ullekh 3000 varsh pehle mila tha
 Its relation is told from Shri Krishna period
 puraanon ke anusaar swayantak mani hi baad main kohinoor kahalaayi
 Karna then got Arjuna and Yudhishthira from Surya
 phir ashok, harsh or chandragupta ke haath yah mani lagi
 In 1306, this gem was first seen near Ramdev, the Maharaja of Malwa
 malwa ke maharaja ko parajeet karke sultan alaudin khilji ne mani par kabja kar liya
 This unmatched diamond passed from Babur to the last Mughal emperor Aurangzeb
 ’jwels of bitrain’ kaa maananaa he ki san 1655 ke aasapaas kohinoor kaa janm hindustan ke golkunda jile kii kohinoor khan se hua
 The diamond then weighed 787 carats
 ise bataur tohfa khan maalikon ne shahjahan ko diya
 Heera stayed with Shah Jahan till 1739
 phir ise nadir shah ke paas rahaa
 Nadir Shah named it Kohinoor after seeing its glittering glow
 kohinoor ko rakhane vaale aakhri hindustani punjab kaa ranjit singh tha
 After taking over the power of Punjab in 1849, Kohinoor fell into the hands of the British
 phir san 1850 main east india company ne hira maharani victoria ko bhent kiya
 England reached and reached Kohinoor weighing only 186
 maharani victoria ke johari prince elwet ne kohinoor kii pun: kataai kii or polish karwaai
 Since 1852, the weight of Kohinoor has remained at 105
6
 san 1911 main kohinoor maharani mairi ke sartaaj main jadaa gaya
 And still in the same crown
 ise landan sthit ‘tower of landan’ sangrahalay main numaaish ke liye rakhaa gaya he
 After the long story of this diamond, many countries have been claiming it
 1976 main, pakistan ke pradhan mantri zulfikaar ali bhutto ne british pradhan mantri gym calleghan ko pakistan ko waapas karne kaa anurodh kiya, jise unhone ek namr "nahin" main uttar diya
 
 The other claim was made by India
 evam va iran ne
 At present, efforts have been issued to bring it back to India
 aazaadee ke fouran baad, bharat ne kai baar kohinoor par apana malikana haq jataayaa he
 Katherine, the daughter of Maharaja Dilip Singh, died in 1942, which could give convincing arguments regarding the Indian claim of Kohinoor
 anuwaad nivedit Apart from Kohinoor from the mines of Golconda, India also produced many precious diamonds of the world
 great mughal, orlov, agra diamond, ahmedabad diamond, brolity of india jaise na jane kitne aise heere hai, jo kohinoor jitne hi beshkeemtee hai

 bharat ke naanaa dharmon main aagam kaa samrajya he
 Jainism has adequate inclusion of Agamapuja even when it is low in quantity
 buddha dharm kaa 'vajrayan' isi paddati kaa prayojak maarg he
 Due to the variation of the deity worshiped in Vedic religion, it has three types: Vaishnava Agam, Shaiva Agam and Shakta Agam
 aagam parampara se aaye hindu dharm ke mahatvapurn granth hai
 These are the complements of the Vedas
 inke vaktaa praayah shivaji hote hai
 This scripture is commonly known as 'tantrashastra'
 nigamagamamoolak bhartiya samskruti kaa aadhaar jis prakaar nigam he, usee prakaar aagam bhi he
 Both are nutritious to each other despite being independent
 nigam karm, gyaan tathaa upasna kaa swaroop batalaata he tathaa aagam inke upaybhoot sadhano kaa varnan karata he
 That is why Vachaspati Mishra has derived the derivation of ‘agam’ in ‘tattvavashardi’ as follows: Agachanti Budhimaoharanti Abhyudayani: Shreyasopaya Yasmatt, Sa Agam:
 aagam kaa mukhya lakshya 'kriya' ke upar he, tathaapi gyaan kaa bhi vivaran yahan kam nahin he
 According to 'varahitantra' the Agama is confluent with these seven traits: Srishti, Pralaya, Devartharna, Sarvashakta, Purana, Shatkarma, Means and Meditation
 'mahanirvana' tantra ke anusaar kaliyug main praani medhya tathaa amedhya ke vichaaron se bahudhaa hin hote hai or inhen ke kalyanarth mahadev ne aagmon kaa upadesh parvati ko swayan diya
 That is why the worship of Agama is considered to be particularly useful and beneficial in Kali Yuga - Kalau Agamasamati:
 vaidic dharm main upasya devtaa kii bhinnata ke kaaran iske teen prakaar he: vaishnav aagam, shaiva aagam tathaa shakt aagam
 Three distinctions are also considered in terms of dvaita, dvaitaadvaita and advaita
 anek aagam vedamulak hai, parantu katipay tantron ke upar bahari prabhaav bhi lakshith hota he
 Especially the influence of China or Tibet on Shakhagam's ethics has been acknowledged in the Puranas
 aagmik puja vishuddh tathaa pavitra bhartiya he
 Ignorance of the mystery of 'panch Makar' is also productive of many illusions about it
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki aagam shaastra kaa gyaan sun kar yaa gurmukh ke dwaara hi paaya ja saktaa he mahadev ke dwaara ye divyagyaan lomash rishi ko praapt hua or phir gurumukh dwaara anya ko The oldest part of Jain literature is called 'agam'
 aagam granth kaaphi pracheen he, tathaa jo sthaan vaidic sahitya kshetra main veda kaa tathaa buddha sahitya main tripitak kaa he, vahi sthaan jain sahitya main aagmon kaa he
 In the Agam texts, there is a compilation of many stories and stories related to the teachings of Mahavira and Jain culture
 ye aagam 46 hai-ang : ayaarang, sooyagdan, thanang, samavayang, bhagwati, nayadhammakaha, uwasgadasa, antgavdasa, anuttarovaviyadasa, panhvagaran, vivagasuy, diththavaay

 a cannon of mid-size is called a howitzer
 jaise-jaise topon ke banane main unnati hui vaise-vaise mortaron or houvitzron ke banane main bhi unnati hui
 In almost all countries, there was an advance in the manufacture of guns in the same way, because there was equal competition

 That is, seed is not produced in cryptogam plants
 kryptogam ko kabhi-kabhi 'thalophita', 'nimna padam', tathaa 'bijaanu padap' aadi anya naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The cryptogam group is the 'antonym group' of the floral group
 kryptogam main shaiwal, likene, moss or fern aate hai
 At one time, cryptogam was recognized as a group in the plant world
 karl linius ne padpon ke apane vargeekaran main sampoorn padap jagat ko 24 virgon main baanta tha jisamen se ek 'kryptogamia' tha jisko punah chaar ganon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha - shaiwal, massi yaa bryophite, philices yaa fern tathaa kavak
 Modern taxonomy has not given cryptogams a place in the plant world because cryptogams are understood to be merely a gathering of several incompatible groups
 vartmaan vargiki ke anusaar kryptogam main aane vaale keval kuch padpon ko hi padap jagat main sthaan diya gaya he, sabhi ko nahin
 Fungi in particular have been accepted as a separate world and are considered to be closely related to animals rather than plants

 Algae are then fused cryptogams

 This temple is dedicated to Sarva Mangala Devi, who is considered the goddess of happiness
 har prishthbhumi ke log mandir main devi kaa darshan kar aashirvad lene aate hai
 The village is very 'believed' of this Goddess temple
 Despite not being connected to the main road, one feels the buzz of the village as soon as it arrives in the village
 The crowd of travelers remains here all over the year, especially in Navratri, a large number of devotees
 The spiritual atmosphere of the village gives a strange peace
 As a matter of fact, this village is famous for the Belon temple dedicated to Sarva Mangala Devi, who is considered the goddess of happiness
 sukh, santosh kii talash me yaha shraddhaluo kaa tota laga rahata he
 samaaj ke har tabake ke log mandir main devi kaa darshan kar aashirwad lene aate hai
 The temple is located in the village of Belon , gaanv kaa naam belon is liye padaa kyonki pracheen kal me yah yah puraa kshetra bel vriksho kii bahutayat vaala tha jis kii vajah se bilon kahalaane laga
 kaha jaataa he aasthaa evam vishwaas ki shukla paksh kii 12 ashtami maa belon bhavani ke darshan se abhishth fal kii prapti hoti he
 Desire is definitely fulfilled
 sameep hi patit paavani ganga maiyaa ke rajghat, kalakatiya evam narora ghat hone se yahaan bhakton kaa aagaman nirantar bana rahata he
 This Devasthan has become the Ramavana of providing mental happiness and peace to people troubled by the runaway of materialism
 yahaan aane vaale bhakton kii sankhya main nirantar ho rahi vruddhi kaa ek mukhya kaaran ek saath do-do pushya kamanaa he
 With the visit of the mother Belon Bhavani with the Ganges bath, where people are getting happiness and peace, the desired wishes are also being fulfilled
 maa belon bhavani ke yahaan pradurbhaav ko lekar philhal koi aitihaasik dastavej to maujuud nahin he, lekin janashruti evam puranic drushti se maa belon vaali ko saakshaat devadidev mahadev kii addhangini mata parvati kaa swaroop mana jaataa he
 Two different legends emerge about this
 chunki maa belon vaali ke pradurbhaav ko lekar abhi koi kisi tarah kaa likhit dastavej nahin he
 Therefore, in the compilation of these legends, the writing had to be faced with heavy ravages, but one thing is clear from both the legends that the mother is in Veerasan with Belon
 arthath maiyaa kaa ek pair pataal main he or tamaam prayaason ke baad bhi maiyaa kii murti ko hataanaa to dur hilaayaa bhi nahin ja saktaa
 The context of his evolution is also associated with the mythology of King Daksha's yagya in it, disregard of Devadidev Mahadev, sadness of his father's unbearable behavior, his renunciation of the body by mother Parvati and Yagna demolition, the virtues of Kupit Mahadev
 bhagwaan shiv or parvati ek baar prithvi lok ke bhraman par nikle
 While traveling, he came to the Bilban area near the western end of the river Ganges
 pracheen kaal main yah kshetra bel ke van se ghira hua tha, jisase iskaa naam bilavan pad gaya
 Here Parvati Maiya saw a sila
 vah is par baithne ke liye lalaayit hui
 She expressed her wish to Lord Shiva and upon getting her permission, she sat on Silla
 maa parvati ke vishram karne par bhagwaan shiv bhi paas hi ek vatvriksh ke paas asana lagaakar baith gaye
 It is said that in the meantime a child came there and he sat on the sila and started resting on the feet of Parvati Maia
 yah dekh mata parvati ne anand or aashcharya kaa mishrit bhav vyakt karte hue bhagwaan mahadev se poocha ki maharaj yah balak koun he or is sila par baithkar main itani anand vibhaar kyon hum
 Lord Mahadev narrated the story of King Daksha's Yagya episode to Goddess Parvati and said that being unhappy with the humiliating behavior of the father, in his previous life you were going through the sky path with the body
 tab sati ke sharir se ek maa kaa lothada or khun kii kuch boond jis sila par padi or iske garbhagrah main samaa gai
 This child is part of the same, this boy was worshiping with the desire of seeing you since then
 aaj tumhaare saakshaat darshan se isaki upasna puri ho gai
 At this, Bhava Vihaval Maa Parvati lifted the child in her lap
 vah is balak ke saath kuch samay yahaan raheen
 At the same time, Lord Shiva said that from today onwards, this sila will be your form, and will be known by the name of Mother Sarva Mangala Devi, whoever will see twelve Ashtami of Shukla Paksha
 use manavaanchit fal praapt hoga
 This child will be known as Languria
 iske darshan se hi maa sarv mangala devi kii yatra puri hogi
 When Maa Parvati was to walk from here, a shadow came out of her body and merged into Silla, which changed Silla into an idol
 iske lagbhag 250 gaj dur jahaan bhagwaan shiv ne vishram kiya tha
 That place became Watkeshwar Mahadev Temple
 yah prasang satyuga kaa he
 It is said that due to the increasing tyranny of demons in Dwapar, people started to cry
 braj se lage kol vatman main aligarh kshetra ke kol rakshas ne aatank barapa rakhaa tha
 The people around prayed to Lord Krishna's eldest brother Dau Balaram to get rid of Kol's terror
 isi ke baad balram ne kol rakshas maaraa gaya
 This brought great relief to the people of the area
 kol kaa vadh karne ke baad balram ji ne ramghat par ganga main snaan kiya
 During this time, he realized the influence of divine power
 iske sammohan main balram vilvan kshetra main pahunch gaye
 Here, he meditated with a desire to see the Goddess and, pleased with this, Mother Sarvamangala Devi appeared to him
 devi ne balram se kaha ki vah unki khandit shakti ko purna pratishthit karen
 After this, Balarama fully revered the vision of Mother Sarvamangala Devi
 janashruti ke anusaar maa sarvamangala devi ke darshan kii abhilaashaa se balram ne caitra shukla paksh kii ashtami ko tapasya shuru kii or agali caitra shukla bhi ashtami ko maa ne unhen darshan dekar tapasya kaa samaapan karaayaa
 Since then, the Ashtami of Chaitra Sukla Paksha is considered to have special significance in the philosophy of mother Sarvamangala Devi
 kalchakra badla kshetra main bhuskhalan hua natijatan belon kaa bagichaa jameen main samaa gaya or maa sarvamangala devi kii jahaan murti thi vah kshetra tapu main badal gaya
 There was little settlement from this
 jise kheda kaha jaataa tha
 yah multah ghasiyaaron kaa gaanv tha
 The haysters used to gather at the same place when they used to dig the grass, where the idol of mother Sarvamangala Devi was buried in the ground
 murti ke sir kaa chota sa hissaa baahar chamakta tha
 The shearer considered it to be a stone stitcher and used to make a razor blade on it
 isse maa ko kaaphi pidaa hoti thi
 The wear of the mother's head to keep the edge on the hoof led to a pit which is still in existence today
 bataate hai ki ek baar jahangir shikaar khelte hue isi bilavan kshetra main aa gaya
 He was accompanied by commander Aniram Badbujar
 achaanak ek sher ne jahangir par akraman kar diya
 To save Jahangir from the lion, Babujar, not caring about his life, put his hand in the lion's mouth
 paas hi khadaa shahjada khurram yah ghatana dekh rahaa tha vah senapati kii jindadilii se kaaphi prabhavit hua
 Seeing the commander in distress, he stabbed the lion from behind and killed him with his sword

 Bilvan region was also involved in this
 samay chakra phir badla
 Rao Bhup Singh, a descendant of Jahangir's commander Babbujar, was of a pious nature
 unhone isi kshetra main apni gadhi banavaai or puja paath main ram gaye
 One day Mother Sarvamangala Dev gave her a dream that she is buried in the ground in such a place
 atah unki murti jahaan he vahaan khudaai karwaakar uskaa bhawan banavaa den
 Rao Bhup Singh remembered the dream
 par vah sthaan yaad nahin rahaa jahaan maa ne apni murti hone kii jaankaree di thi
 Now Rao Bhup Singh's restlessness started increasing
 jab pidaa asahneeya ho gai to unhone banaras ke vidwaan brahmanon ko bulaakar apni samasya bataai
 The Brahmins suggested Rao to perform Satchandi Yajna for this
 raav turant taiyaar ho gaye
 Shatchandi Yajna was done and Rao, who became Yajman, performed the night-time sacrifice in the yard
 raatri main maa sarvamangala devi ne unhen phir swapn diya or vah sthaan bataaya jahaan unki pratimaa dabi thi
 As soon as dawn, Rao informed the Brahmins about the dream and on the instructions of the Brahmins, Rao Bhup Singh started digging at the place mentioned by the mother, seeing this statue of the mother there, Rao decided to put it outside his mansion
 mazdooron ko murti surakshit nikaalane kaa hukum diya
 The laborers tried hard but got defeated
 murti ke ek pair kaa koi ore chor nahin mila
 The mother then tells Rao that one of her legs is in place
 isliye meraa isi sthaan par bhawan banawaao
 And that's how the temple of Mother Sarvamangala Devi was built
 bataaya jaataa he ki raav bhoop singh ke vanshaj kalyaan singh ke koi santan nahin hui
 This distracted him greatly and took refuge in the scholarly Damaramayas of Benares
 dharmachayon ne kaha ki jab tak maiyaa kaa chadhaava khaanaa band nahin karoge, santan sukh asambhav he
 Kalyan Singh immediately implemented this and entrusted the responsibility to the two Brahmins for the worship service of Maiya
 isi ke baad raav kalyaan singh ko santan kii prapti hui
 Sacrifice day is also celebrated every year in the courtyard of Belon Wali Maia
 yah caitra shukla kii trayodash evam asina maah ke shuklapaksh kii trayodashi ko manaaya jaataa he
 About three decades ago, here goats were sacrificed
 chunki puja archana kaa daayitv sanbhaalane vaale brahmanon ne balipuja se khud ko shaamil hone se asamarthta vyakt kar di thi
 Therefore, a person was appointed for this

 The building where the mother Belon is built is a forest area of belpatras

 ise kabhi-kabhaar santulit sansad yaa bina kisi niyantran vaali vidhayika bhi kaha jaataa he
 If the legislature is bicameral and the government is only responsible to the lower house, then the term "hung parliament" is used only for that house
 do party pranali ke adhikansh chunaavon main ek party ko purna bahumat praapt ho jaataa he or vah jald hi ek nai sarkaar kaa gathan kar leti he; "trishanku sansad" is dhaanche kaa ek apwaad he or ise aniyamit yaa avaanchhneeya mana ja saktaa he
 One or both main parties may try to form a coalition government with some other smaller parties, or a minority government with the help of some other parties or independent members
 yadi ye prayaas vifal ho jate he, sansad bhang karne or nae sire se chunaav karaae jane ke atirikt koi vikalp nahin bachataa he
 In a multi-party system, as is usually the case in legislatures elected by proportional representation, negotiation for the formation of post-election coalition government is quite common; The term "hung parliament" is not used
 united kingdom, australia or canada, in sabhi kii vartmaan sansad trishanku sansad hai
 It is quite unusual for Commonwealth nations to have such a large number of hung parliaments at the national level
 pratham vishwa yuddh se pehle united kingdom main kai pidiyon tak, ek kaaphi had tak sthir do-daleey pranali astitv main thi; paaramparik taur par keval tori or vigs, yaa unnisvin sadi ke madhya se conservative tathaa libral partiyaan sansad main kaaphi adhik sankhya main apane sadasyon ko nirvaachit karne main safal raheen
 Thus hung parliaments were quite rare in the nineteenth century

 However, the two Reform Acts greatly broadened the franchise and reorganized the constituencies, coincidentally at the same time, considerable changes were seen in Irish politicians
 1885 ke aam chunaavon ke baad kisi bhi party ko purna bahumat nahin mila
 The Irish Parliamentary Party held the key to power and offered Irish self-government as a condition for its support
 haalanki, libral party irish swarajya ke mudde par vibhajit ho gai, jiske parinamswaroop 1886 main phir se aam chunaav hue jisamen kanjarvative ne adhikansh siton par kabja karte hue swarajya kaa virodh karne vaali libral unianist party ke samarthan se shashan kiya
 The elections of January 1910 and December 1910 gave rise to a hung parliament in which the ruling Liberal Party and the Conservative Party won almost identical seats
 aisa sansadeey sankat tathaa lebar party ke udai ke kaaran hua tha
 This did not happen for many years after the hung parliament that emerged as a result of the 1929 elections; Meanwhile, the Labor Party moved out of the Liberal Party and became one of the two major parties
 1929 ke chunaavon ke baad se, britain main do aam chunaavon main trishanku sansad saamne ai he
 The first was the election of February 1974 and the parliament formed lasted only till October
 The second election was in May 2010, resulting in a hung parliament and the Conservative Party as the largest party
 teen mukhya partiyon ke parinaam is prakaar the - conservatives - 307, lebar- 258, libral democrates - 57
 The loss of a by-election may lead to the end of a weakened majority of the government, and the creation of a hung parliament by members of Parliament joining the opposition, or the resignation of mps of the House of Common
 aisa disambar 1996 main jon major kii conservative sarkaar or 1978 ke madhya main james calhan kii lebar sarkaar ke saath hua tha; is baad kii avadhi ko asantosh kaa sheetkaal ke naam se janaa jaataa he

 Studies related to the hung parliament include David Butler's Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliament in Britain and Vernon Bogdanore's 'multi-party Politics and the Constitution'
 canada kii vartmaan sansad, 38veen tathaa 39veen sansad kii hi tarah trishanku sansad he; haalanki, canada main is shabd kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Instead, the term "minority government" or "minority parliament" is used

 Harper's Conservative Party improved its minority status in the October 2008 federal election; It is also a hung parliament

 Hung parliaments at the federal level are rare in Australia, as the system here is almost identical to a two party system in which the Australian Labor Party competes against a coalition of Conservative parties
 1910 se pehle kisi bhi party ko pratinidhi sabha main purna bahumat praapt nahin tha kyonki vahaan do gaiyr-lebar partiyaan pratispardhaa main thim
 As a result, there was a constant change in government, many of which took place during the tenure of Parliament

 In the 2010 federal election, outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard received the support of four independent members and remained in power
 trishanku sansad rajya str par kahin adhik saamaanya hai
 The Tasmania Legislative Assembly and a unicameral parliament of the Australian Capital Territory are both elected by the heyer-clark proportional representation, so a hung parliament usually appears in elections

 Alternatively, a minority government with trust and supply agreements can be formed based on previously agreed policy concessions or issue-based support
 farvari 1974 ke aam chunaav main vartmaan pradhanmantri edward hith ne vipakshi lebar party kii tulana main kam site jeetne ke baavjood ek gathbandhan sarkaar banane kaa prayaas karne ke liye istipha dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 They were unable to do so, so the Labor Party led by Harold Wilson formed a minority government
 britain ke 2010 ke aam chunaavon main ek or trishanku sansad astitv main ai or ek sthir sarkaar banane kaa prayaas karne ke liye vyapak vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya
 This resulted in the formation of a coalition government which was also an absolute majority government; This government was a coalition government of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats winning the majority of seats and votes in the election

 software pareekshan is moolyankan ke prayaas kii prakriya he
 a study conducted by NIST in 2002 showed that software bugs cost the US economy $ 59
5 billion annually
 yadi behatar software pareekshan kii jaae, to is laagat kaa ek tihaai hissaa bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Initially, the separation of debugging from testing was attributed to Glenford J
 Promoted by Myers in 1979
 haalanki unka dhyaan bracoge pareekshan par tha isane software ejineering samudaay kii buniyadi vikaas gatividhiyon, jaise dibging ko satyaapan se alag karne kii ichha kii pushti kii
 Dave Gelperin and William C
 Hetzel classified the phases and goals in software testing in 1988 into the following stages: pareekshan kaa ek praathmik uddeshy, software vifaltaaon kaa pataa lagaana he, taaki dosha ko khoja or sudhara ja sake
 This is a non-negligible finding
 pareekshan yah sthapit nahin kar saktaa ki ek utpaada sabhi paristhitiyon main thik-thik kaary kar rahaa he, par sirf itnaa sthapit kar saktaa he ki yah kin vishisht paristhitiyon main thik-thik kaam nahin karata he
 The scope of software testing often includes the execution of that code in various environments and situations, as well as the investigation of aspects of that code, in addition to the examination of the code: whether it does what it should and what it does, what it does This needs to be done
 software vikaas kii vartmaan samskruti main ek pareekshan sanghathan, vikaas dal se alag ho saktaa he
 There are different roles for members of the test team
 software pareekshan se praapt jaankaree kaa prayog, us prakriya ko sahi karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jiske dwaara software kaa vikaas kiya gaya he
 Functional testing refers to a test that verifies a specific action or function of the code
 ye aam taur par code kii aavashyaktaaon ke pralekhan main paaya jaataa he, haalanki kuch vikaas prakriya, prayukt maamle yaa upyogkarta khabaron se kaam karte hai
 Functional tests answer the question "can the user do it" or "does this particular feature work"
 non-functional pareekshan, software ke un pahaluon ko darshata he, jo sambhav he ki kisi vishesh prakaarya yaa upyogkarta kii kriya, jaise arohan yaa suraksha se sambandhit naa hon
 non-functional pareekshan is tarah ke sawaalon kaa jawaab detaa he ki "ek baar main kitne log log in kar sakate hai", yaa "is software ko hack karnaa kitna aasaan he"
 Not all software flaws are caused by code errors
 mahange dosha kaa ek aam strot, apekshaaon ke interval ke kaaran panapata he, udhaaharan he, aparichit apekshaayen, jo program diziner dwaara vilopan kii trutiyon main falit hote hai
 a common source of expectation interval is non-functional expectation, such as testability, mountability, maintenance capacity, usability, performance, and security
 software dosha nimnlikhit prakriyaaon ke madhyam se hote hai
 The programmer makes an error, which results in a malfunction in the source code of the software
 yadi is karaabi ko nishpadit kiya jaataa he, to kuch khaas sthitiyon main system trutipurn parinaam degaa, jo ek vifaltaa kaa kaaran banegaa
 Not all faults will necessarily result in failure
 udhaaharan ke liye, ded code main dosha, kabhi vifaltaa main parinat nahin honge
 When the environment is changed, a breakdown can turn into a failure
 pariveshgat in parivartanon ke udaahranon main shaamil hai, software kaa ek nae hardware platform par chalaaya janaa, sorce data main parivartan yaa bhinn software ke saath parsparik kriya
 ek ekal truti, vifaltaa ke vistrut lakshan main parinat ho sakati he
 It is generally believed that the earlier a malfunction is discovered, the cheaper it is to fix
 nimnlikhit talika, karaabi ke pataa lagaae jane vaale charan ke aadhaar par, use thik karne kii laagat ko darshaati he
 For example, if a problem with expectations is revealed only after release, then the cost will be 10–100 times more than the cost of detection by reviewing the expectations
 software vifaltaa kaa ek aam kaaran, anya anuprayog, ek nae oparating system, yaa, badhate hue web brouzar sanskaran ke saath sangatta he
 In the case of a lack of backwards compatibility, this may be because the programmer considered testing their program's coding or software only on the "latest version" of this-and-that operating system
 is tathy kaa anayas nateeja yah he ki: unka naveenatam kaary, software / hardware ke purv mishran ke saath puri tarah se sangat nahin bhi ho saktaa he, yaa yah ek anya mahatvapurn oparating system ke saath puri tarah se sangat nahin ho saktaa he
 In any case, these differences, whatever they may be, would have resulted in software failure, as realized by some significant sections of computer users
 ise ek "suraksha unmukh ranneeti" maan sakate hai, jo ki dev gelprin or wiliam si
 hetzel dwaara sujhaaye naveenatam parikshan charan ke saath sateek baithta he, jaisaa ki neeche uddhrut he
 
 software pareekshan ke saath ek mukhya samasya he ki input or pre-condishan ke saare combination ke antargat pareekshan sambhav nahin he, yahan tak ki ek saamaanya utpaada ke saath bhi nahin
 This means that the number of defects in a software product can be quite high and the defects that occur occasionally are difficult to find in testing
 adhik mahatvapurn rup se, gunvattta ke gair-kaaryaatmak aayam - upyog-kshamta, arohan-kshamta, nishpaadan, sangatta, vishwasaneeyata-atyant vyaktiparak ho sakate hai; kuch aisa, jo ek vyakti ke liye paryaapt mulya kaa gathan karata he, jo duusare ke liye asahneeya he
 There are several approaches to software testing
 samiksha, aar-paar guzaarana, yaa nirikshan ko static pareekshan mana jaataa he, jabaki die gaye ek pareekshan maamle ke set ke saath vaastavik nishpadit program code dinemic pareekshan mana jaataa he
 Static testing can be omitted
 dinemic pareekshan tab prayukt hota he, jab khud program ko hi pehali baar prayog kiya ja rahaa ho 
 Dynamic testing can begin to test specific parts of the code before 100% completion of the program
 iske liye vishisht takanic hai stabs / drivers kaa prayog karnaa yaa phir ek dibgar parivesh se nishpaadan
 udhaaharan ke liye, spredshit program, khud apni prakruti dwaara, kaaphi had tak paraspar rup se jaanche jate hai, jiske tahat parinaam, prayek gananaa yaa text parichaalan ke turant baad pradarshit hote hai
 Software testing is used in association with verification and authentication: satyaapan or pramanikaran shabd kaa aam taur par prayog, udyog main antar-parivartanshiltaa se kiya jaataa he; in donon shabdon ko galat tareeke se paribhaashit karnaa bhi aam he
 According to the standard terminology of IEEE Software Engineering: software pareekshan software tester dwaara kii ja sakati he
 The term "software tester" was commonly used until the 1980s, but was later seen as a separate business
 software pareekshan main avadhiyon or vibhinn lakshyon se sambandhit vibhinn bhoomikaaon ko sthapit kiya gaya he: manager, test lead, test diziner, tester, automation develper or test administrator Although controversial, software testing can be seen as an important part of the software quality assurance process
 SQA main, software prakriya visheshgy or lekha pareekshak, software or uske vikaas par ek vyapak drushtikon rakhte hai
 They investigate the software engineering process and replace it to reduce the amount of defects in the software provided: the so-called defect rate
 ek "sweekaarya dosha dar" kaa gathan karne vaali chizein software kii prakruti par nirbhar karti hai
 For example, in an arcade video game designed to give the impression of flying an airplane, it would likely have a relatively greater tolerance for faults, compared to mission critical software used to control an airliner
 Happens, which is actually flying
 yadhyapi SQA ke saath ghanishtha sambandh hai, pareekshan vibhaag aksar swatantra rup se kaary karte hai or ho saktaa he ki kisi company main SQA kaa koi kaary naa ho
 Software testing is the task of detecting defects in software by comparing the expected results of a computer program to a given input set, compared to its actual results
 virodhabhas swaroop, QA, darasal hone vaali trutiyon ko rokane ke uddeshy se nitiyon or prakriyaaon kaa karyanvayan he
 Software testing methods have traditionally been divided into black box testing and white box testing
 in donon abhigmon kaa prayog us drushtikon ke varnan ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ek test ejeeniyar test maamalon kii digining ke liye apanaataa he
 Black box testing treats the software as a "black box" - black box testing methods without any internal implementation information include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all pairs testing, fudge testing, model-based Testing, traceability metrics, exploratory testing and specification-based testing
 isliye, blike box pareekshan main ek ore "ek asambaddh raay" kaa phayda he or duusari ore "andhi talash" kaa nuksaan
 White box testing occurs when the tester has access to algorithms, including internal data structures and the code that implements it
 ve donon ek code kawarej metric ko lautaate hai, jise pratishat ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 Gray box testing involves access to internal data structures and algorithms to design test cases, but at the user, or black box level
 Changing input data and formatting output do not fall under the gray box, since input and output are clearly out of the "black-box" that we are calling the system under test
 yah antar vishesh rup se tab mahatvapurn he, jab do alag developers dwaara likhe code ke do modulon ke bich integration pareekshan sampadit kii jaati he, jahaan pareekshan ke liye sirf interphes ko prastut kiya jaataa he
 However, modifying a data repository must fall under the gray box, since typically the user will not be able to change data outside the system under test
 grey box pareekshan main reverse ejineering bhi shaamil ho sakati he, udhaaharan ke liye, boundari vailu yaa truti sandesh nirdhaarit karne ke liye
 Tests are often classified based on their place of involvement in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test
 unit pareekshan un pareekshanon ko sanderbhit karata he, jo code ke ek vishesh khand kii kaaryashiltaa, aam taur par prakriya str par, satyapit karte hai
 In an object-oriented environment, this often occurs at the category level and involves minimal unit testing of constructors and destructors
 is prakaar ke pareekshan aam taur par developers dwaara likhe jate hai, jab ve code par kaam kar rahe hote hai, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki ek vishesh prakriya apekshanuroop thik dhang se kaam kar rahi he
 To catch corner cases or other branches in the code, a process may have multiple tests
 unit pareekshan akele, software ke ek ansh kii kaaryakshmata ko satyapit nahin kar sakati, balki iskaa prayog yah sunishchit karne ke liye hota he ki software dwaara prayukt building block, ek duusare se swatantra rup se kaary karte hai
 Integration testing is any type of software test that attempts to verify interfaces between components against a software design
 software ghatak ko, punraritiya tareeqe se yaa ek saath ekikrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The earlier approach is generally considered a better practice, as it allows interface issues to be quickly localized and fixed
 integration pareekshan, interphes main trutiyaan ujagar karne or ekikrut ghatak ke bich parsparik kriya ko darshane ke liye kaam karata he
 Progressively, large clusters of tested software components are integrated and tested to fit the elements of architectural design until the software begins to function as a system
 system pareekshan yah satyapit karne ke liye ek puri tarah se ekikrut system kaa pareekshan karata he ki vah apni aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karata he
 System Integration Testing confirms that a system is integrated with any external or other party systems defined in the system requirements
 regration pareekshan ek pramukh code parivartan ke baad dosha ko khojane par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 In particular, it attempts to uncover software regression or older bugs that have returned
 jab bhi software prakriya, jo pehle sahi dhang se kaam kar rahi thi or ab apekshanusaar kaary karnaa band kar de, tab aise pratigaman ghatit hote hai
 Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program change when the newly developed part of the software collides with the already existing code
 regration pareekshan ke aam tareekon main shaamil he, pehle chalaae gaye pareekshan ko phir se chalaanaa or jaanch karnaa ki pehle thik kii gai kharabiyaan kahin phir se ubhar to nahin ai hai
 The depth of the test depends on the stage in the release process and the risk of additional features
 They can either be completed, for changes added too late in the release, or risky, to far shallow, made up of positive testing at each feature if the changes are happening early in release or are considered low risk Go
 exeptence pareekshan kaa taatpary do main se ek se ho saktaa he: Alpha testing is mock or real operational testing by potential users / customers or an independent test team on the developer's site
 software ke beta pareekshan main jane se pehle, alpha pareekshan ko aksar of-da-shelf software ke liye aantarik sweekruti pareekshan ke ek rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Beta testing comes after alpha testing
 beta sanskaran ke naam se vikhyath software kaa sanskaran, programing team se baahar ek simit graahakon ke liye jari kiya gaya
 The software is released to groups of people, so that further testing can be done to ensure that the product has minimal faults or bugs
 kabhi-kabhi, beta sanskaran ko bhavi upyogkartaaon kii adhiktam sankhya ko pratikriya ke kshetra ko badhaane ke liye, khuli janata ke liye uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he
 Special methods exist for testing non-functional aspects of software
 kaaryaatmak pareekshan ke vipareet, jo software ke sahi sanchaalan ko sthapit karata he, gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan is baat kii pushti karata he ki software tab bhi thik dhang se kaary karata he, jab ise avaidh yaa apratyaashit input praapt hoti he
 Software fault injection, in the form of fuzzing, is an example of a non-functional test
 gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan, vishesh rup se software kii khatir, yah sthapit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he ki pareekshan ke antargat rachana, avaidh yaa anpekshit input ko sahan kar sakati he yaa nahin or is prakaar ve input vailidation routine or saath hi saath erar-handlling routine kii majbootee ko sthapit kar sakenge
 Various commercial non-functional testing tools are linked to the software fault injection page; Many open source and free software tools are available, which perform non-functional testing
 parformens pareekshan, yaa lod pareekshan yah dekhne ke liye jaanch karata he ki software, badi maatra main data yaa upyogkartaaon ko sambhaal saktaa he yaa nahin
 This is generally known as software scalability
 gair-kaaryaatmak software pareekshan kii yah gatividhi aksar kshamta pariksha ke rup main jaani jaati he
 Stability testing checks to see if the software can function consistently well over or above an acceptable period
 gair-kaaryaatmak software pareekshan kii yah gatividhi aksar lod pareekshan ke rup main nirdisht hoti he
 Usability testing is needed to test whether the user interface is easy to use and understand
 suraksha pareekshan us software ke liye jaruri he jo havers dwaara system ghuspaith ko rokane ke liye gopneey data ko parishkrut karata he
 Internationalization and localization are needed to examine these aspects of software, for which a pseudostabilization method can be used
 yah is baat kii pushti karegaa ki anuprayog, ek nai bhashaa main anuwaad kiye jane yaa ek nai samskruti ke liye anukulit kiye jane ke baad bhi kaam karata he
 Destructive testing attempts to thwart software or subsystems to test its robustness
 software pareekshan ke ek aam tareeke ko, ise graahak ko bheje jane se pehle or isaki kaaryakshmata viksit kiye jane ke baad, pareekshakon ke ek swatantra samooh dwaara sampadit kiya jaataa he
 This practice often results in the testing phase being used as a project buffer to compensate for project delays and thus compromise the time devoted to testing
 ek or paripati he pariyojna ke shuru hone ke kshan hi software pareekshan ko shuru kar dena or pariyojna ke samaapan tak yah ek satat prakriya he
 In response, some emerging software disciplines such as Extreme Programming and Agile Software Development Movement follow a "test drive software development" model
 is prakriya main, software ejeeniyar dwaara unit test pehle likhe jate hai, 
 beshak ye pareekshan shuru main vifal ho jate hai; jaise ki unase ummid rahati he
 And then as the code is written it passes incrementally to a larger fraction of the test suite
 test sweet ko, vifaltaa kii nai paristhitiyon or corner cese ke milte rahane ke kaaran, lagaataar navinikrut kiya jaataa he or unhen kisi bhi viksit regration test ke saath ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Unit tests along with the rest of the software source code are maintained and typically integrated into the build process
 haalanki sanghathanon ke bich bhinnata maujuud he, pareekshan ke liye ek vishisht chakra hota he
 The following sample is common among organizations adopting the water fall development model
 kai programing samooh, swachaalit pareekshan par adhikadhik nirbhar kar rahe hai, vishesh rup se aise samooh jotest chaalit vikaas kaa upyog karte hai
 There are several frameworks for writing tests, and continuous integration software will run the test automatically each time the code is tested in a version control system
 jabaki swachaalan vah sab kuch nirmit nahin kar saktaa, jo ki ek maanav kar saktaa he, yah regration pareekshan ke liye bahut upyogi ho sakate hai
 However, to be really useful, it requires a fully developed test suite of script tests
 program pareekshan or gadabadi kaa pataa lagane main pareekshan upkaran or dibgar dwaara kaaphi sahaayta praapt ho sakati he
 Characteristics of test / debug devices include: in gunon main se kuch ko ek ekikrut vikaas parivesh main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally, topics to which quality is limited are precision, completeness, safety, but may also include more technical requirements as described under ISO standard ISO 9126, such as capacity, reliability, efficiency, portability, maintenance, Compatibility and 0} usability
 kai aam software upaay maujuud hai, jinhen aksar 'matrix' kaha jaataa he, jinka prayog software kii haalat yaa pareekshan kii paryaaptta ke maapan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The software testing process can generate many artifacts
 software pareekshakon or gunvattta aashwaasan visheshgyon kii peshewar aakankshaon ko bal dene ke liye kai pramann kaarykram maujuud hai
 There is currently none of the certification provided, which actually requires the applicant to demonstrate software testing capability
 koi bhi pramanikaran, vyapak rup se sweekrut gyaan ke dhaanche par aadhaarit nahin he
 This fact has led some to say that the testing area is not yet ready for certification
 akele pramann ek vyakti kii utpaadakta, unke kaushal, yaa vyaavhaarik gyaan ko maap nahin saktaa or ek pareekshak ke rup main unki kshamta, yaa peshevraana style kii guarantee nahin de saktaa
 Some of the major software testing disputes include: kendriya electronica abhiyantriki anusandhan santhaan, pilaani, vaigyanik tathaa audyogic anusandhan parishad kii ek sanghatak prayogshaala he jisaki sthapana san 1953 main hui thi
 The actual R&D work started in the last part of the year 1958
 yah santhaan mukhyat: ardhchaalak yuktiyon, electronic pranaaliyon or electronic nalikaaon ke kshetra main shodh evam vikaas main karyrat he
 From the very beginning, special attention has been paid to the development of basic facilities, specialized manpower and expertise in the implementation of many projects
 pilaani main mukhyalay ke saath-saath chennai main iskaa kshetreey kendra he jo ki si

 In this regional center, research and development work is mainly going on related to paper and food processing
 siesaiaar-siri ke pramukh anusandhan or vikaas kaaryakramon ko teen pramukh kshetron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he: microwave tubs, semiconductor yuktiyaan or electronic pranaliyaan
 In the field of microwave tubes, the focus is mainly on communication tubes and industrial tubes
 semiconductor yuktiyon ke kshetra main isi dizin, power electronic, yukti prasanskaran, microwave upkarnon, sankar sookshm paripath, photonix or prakaash electronic upkarnon or semiconductor saamagree par pariyojnaayen sakriy rup se jari he
 In the field of electronic systems research and development focus on numerical systems, agricultural electronics, speech technology, industrial electronics, instrumentation systems and communication engineering
 garaamukhi yaa pankamukhi yaa pank jwalamukhi ek aisi prakritik rachana ko kehete hai jisamen zamin ke neeche se ubharate hue garam dravon or gaison se ek tila ban jaae jiske upar sthit mukh se geeli mitti or malba ugalta ho
 In a way, it is similar to a volcano although the lava does not come out of the Garamukhi and their temperature is much lower than the volcanoes
 puure vishwa main lagbhag 700 garaamukhi gyaat hai or sabase bada vaala 700 meter unchaa he or 10 kimi kaa vyas rakhata he

 All types of flights are considered to be under civil aviation except for military operated flights
 isamen jo kaary vyavhaar main aate hai ve ye hai : yatriyon kaa vyavsaayik yatayaat, maal or dak, vyapaar yaa shauk ke liye nijee haisiyat se kii gai udaanen tathaa sarkari uddeshyon kii purti ke liye kiya gaya iskaa upyog
 Two American brothers Arivil Wright and Wilbur Wright are considered to be the fathers of today's popular civil and military aviation
 1903 main hi in bandhuon ne pehle aisi yatra kii thi jisamen vayuyan injayukt or hawa se baari tha
 In many other countries in air aviation, especially in France, experiments were being done in this direction
 1910 tak hawaii yatayaat ko adhikansh deshon main vyaavhaarik reeti se apana liya gaya tha
 Soon the First World War broke out
 isane vaigyanik evam pravidhik prayogon ko unnat hone kii paryaapt prerana di ore yuddh kaa ant hote hote yatayaat ke hawaii saadhan bhalee bhanti drudh ho chuke the
 Thereafter there was rapid progress
 1919 ke ant tak landan or paris ke bich vayucharyaayein chaalu ho gai
 This type of contact was also established with some other big cities of Europe
 rus main leningrad or masco ke bich niyamit charyaayein chaalu hui
 The commercial progress of the United States was somewhat slow, however aircrafts began to operate in Seattle and Victoria and key-west and Havena
 1919 se 1939 tak kii pragati drut rahi
 Airways between different countries gradually became dense and the French, British and Dutch established long airways to their colonies located in Africa and the Far East
 germany ne dakshini america main hawaii yatayaat kaa sampark sthapit kiya tathaa brazil, arjetina tathaa kuch anya laathini amareeki deshon main apane vayuyanon kaa ghanaa jaal failaayaa
 In 1929, the United States of America established an airway from Miami to Chile, on the western side of South America
 1931 main germany evam brazil ke bich germany kii ek zeplin charya sthapit hui 
 In 1935, the airplane floating in the water across the Pacific Ocean and in 1936 the Zepplin crossing of the ocean was commissioned
 1939 main uttari evam dakshini andh mahaasaagar ke aar paar janevaali niyamit udaanen hone lageen
 Commercial airplanes then surrounded the entire world
 phir dwitiya mahayuddh saamne aayaa
 It also promoted technological advancement and increased knowledge of aviation
 akhil vishwa ke paimaane par sainik hawaii yatayaat ke kaaryon kaa hona us samay kii ek bahut badi anivaaryta thi
 Aviation now gained a lot of strength
 1945 main yuddh samaapt hua
 In the years that followed, there were major changes in commercial air passengers and related goods and the vast expansion of airways came into view in the world
 parivahan kii kshamta bad gai
 The pace intensified and the voyages began to expand
 ingine chaalit vayuyanon ke badale tarabine chaalit, phir jet chaalit vayuyan bane
 In October 1958, the first jet service to cross the dark ocean, from the United States of America, to Britain and France, was inaugurated
 is prakaar vyavsaayik uddyan ne ab jet yug main pravesh kar liya he
 The discussion of the running of airways in India was started long ago by the Government of India, only in 1917
 pratham vishwayuddh ke samaapt hote hi, sitambar, 1919 main sarkaar ne bharat bhar main dak pahunchaane kaa puraa uttardaayitv ek yatayaat company ko saunp dene kaa nishchay kiya, parantu kuch kaary na ho sakaa
 a year later, there was a tendency towards the government to set up airports and provide facilities for the services of bombay-calcutta and calcutta-rangoon
 ek bhartiya vayumandli sthapit hui
 Despite everything, the government did nothing more than make policy
 baad ke kuch varshon main britain, france or holland ne bharat ke baahar sudur-purvi upniveshon main hawaii charyaayein sthapit kin
 These advances also compelled the Government of India to think and felt the need to carry out subsidiary exercises in India
 parinamat: bhartiya vyapaariyon se baatcheet aarambh kii gai
 These negotiations have resulted in the development of Tata Airline and Indian National Airways
 in companiyon ne dak dhone ke liye ek injanavaale halke vayuyanon dwaara kaarysanchalan aarambh kiya
 The state air mail scheme, created in 1938 by the Government of India, encouraged the expansion of the industry
 bade vayuyanon kaa upyog hone laga or nai nai charyaayein khuleen
 Then World War II came
 indian airline kaa upyog samrik aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye kiya jane laga
 These services were used by borrowed aircrafts, especially Dakota aircraft, on several routes under the Airways of the State Air Force's traffic command
 purvokt airlinon kaa kaary saunpa gaya
 This gave them the opportunity to use modern-day aircraft and many people trained and became proficient in these tasks
 agast, 1945 main yuddh samaapt hone par airlinon par se sarkari niyantran hat gaya or ve pun: vyavsaayik str par aa gai
 The most important thing in the field of Indian civil aviation was seen in the post-war years - the improved development of the consciousness of air travel among Indian travelers
 hawaii udyog main tivrata aa gai jisase desh ke pramukh udyogpati paryaapt sankhya main vaayu yatayaat ke udyog kii ore agrasar hue
 By January of 1947, the Air Traffic License Board received 122 applications for various useful airways
 ant main board ne air india, indian naishanal airways tathaa air services ov india aadi puraani chaalu companiyon ke atirikt nimnlikhit 11 nai companiyon ko asthaayee anumatipatr pradaan kiye : dekan airways, daalamia jain airways, bharat airways, airways, orient airways missri airways, ambika air lines or jupiter airways
 Thus by granting permission to many operators, in a situation when the possibilities of trading in many routes were very limited, a situation arose which led to undesirable rivalry which was economically inconsistent and detrimental
 isane is udyog ke liye badi gambhir kathinaaiyaan upasthit kar deen
 Some companies went bankrupt
 shesh ne sarkaar par is baat ke liye jor diya ki vah uddyan ko anupranit rakhane ke liye vittiya sahaayta kuch chhot ke rup main de
 It now became clear that this industry needed such financial support from which it would continue to expand
 yah bhi spasht ho gaya ki ab is udyog ke paas khule bazaar main dhan ugaahne kii kshamta nahin rah gai
 Keeping all these things in mind, the government appointed a committee which came to the conclusion that all the air companies should be transferred to a huge corporation authorized by the state
 may, 1953 main sansad ne air corporation sambandhi ek adhinium paarit kiya tathaa agast, 1953 main indian airlines corporation sthapit ho gaya, jiske antargat indian airlines tathaa air india naamak do hawaii sevaayen chaalu hui
 Indian Airlines provides flights to Burma, Nepal and Sri Lanka in and around the country and Air India provides air services to 24 countries around the world
 pehle saal to corporation ko vyavastha evam sanchaalan sambandhi anek samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The earlier pattern of airways was no longer suitable, so it needed to be reviewed
 yantric paksh main bhi anek ulajhanein utpann hui or is baat kii aavashyaktaa hui ki nae sakasham kaarkaane sthapit kiye jaaen
 On the other hand, there was a need to establish a sufficient number of new ticket houses in the business side and to renovate the old buildings
 booking agenton ke puure dhaanche ko bahut kuch badalanaa padaa tathaa videshi companiyon or sarkaron se naveen antardeshiy samjhaute karne pade
 All these problems were successfully tackled and the first step on the path of progress
 1953-54 main indian airlines corporation teen karod se adhik kii aay hui
 In the second year, plans for nationalization started gaining momentum to make it firm
 alag alag vayumargo kii vyavastha ke sthaan par samooche dhaanche kii sanghatit niyantranmaili apanaai gai
 a firm operating institution was established at the center
 puraa sanchalanakshetra teen bhaagon main baanta gaya or dilli, bombai tathaa kalakatta iske nae centre hue
 With the entry of the corporation in the third year, the organization and operation of accounting book were also fixed in a definite manner
 jahaji bedon main bhi aath herron naamak teen skymaster naamak vayuyanon ko rakhkar unhen samrudh banaaya gaya
 The plan to use Vicount aircraft also took shape
 skymaster kii ratricharya bhi sthapit hui
 Indian Air Co
 Participated significantly in the delivery of goods to flooded areas of Assam
 1956-57 main vyapaar samrudhtar hua or vayuyanon kii sankhya badhaane kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Hence, simultaneous orders were sent for five viccounts

 omkara shukla urf omi ek bahubali he, jo raajnneetik hastkshep ke liye janaa jaataa hai
 He is the head of several illegal groups in which he serves the criminal motives of local politicians like Tiwari Bhaisab
 ishwar tyaagi urf langadaa or keshav upaadhyaay urf keshu firangi uske najdiki sipahasalar kii tarah rahete hai
 In the opening scene of the film, the lame Tyagi challenges Razju to postpone her marriage or to stop Dolly Mishra being led by Omi by stopping a bus-filled procession
 rajju akele girte-padate sasuraal pahunchakar omi dwaara agavaai kii khabar karata he
 Daly's father, lawyer Raghunath Mishra, known by all as 'lawyer Saab', rushes to Omi's hideout with his men
 or omi ke sar pe pistaul taante hue daali ko chhodane kii dhamkee dete hai
 But at the very moment, Bhaisab calls for stopping the bloodshed by calling the current political situation by breaking phone tensions between the two
 agle din raghunatha apni beti ko chhudaane ke liye bhaisaab par dabaav banaate hai
 But the real issue opens up to Dolly's own father when Dolly willingly accepts Omi and falsifies his forced leadership
 or is nirnay ke kaarnon kii ghatana ek-ek kar vajah bataati hai
 Dolly's father is broken by shame and betrayal
 yahaan nirdeshak kathanak main mode daalane ke liye mul rachana 'othelo' kaa hi zikr karte he, jahaan daali ke pita omi ko samajhaate hai 'bahubali ! aurat ke tricharitra ko mat bhoolanaa
 Who can cheat his father and what will he be like? omi ab raajnneetik shadyantron ke bich duusare pratidwandvi jaise indore singh or surendra captain ko chunaav main bhaag lene se rokane ke liye ms sex scandel jaise hatkande apnaane yaa unhen hi mitaane kaa kaam karata hai

 or phir party ke nae 'bahubali' ke rikt pad ke liye omi tab langadaa ke tamaam raajnneetik gatividhiyon ke anubhav ke baavjood keshu ko nayaa daavedaar ghoshit karata hai
 With the dry decision of Omi, the lame finds himself feeling disrespected and envious of Keshu because according to him Keshu is inexperienced as well as irresponsible even if he is educated and popular among the youth
 is apmaan kaa badla lene ke liye vah keshu ko shubhakamanaayen dene ke bahaane sharaab pine ko phusalaata he, jiske nashe se keshu unmaadi hokar rajju or mehmaanon se jhagad padataa he
 Omi gets to know Keshu's handiwork, which causes Omi to doubt his decision
 yahaan langadaa ek haath se keshu ko daali kii puraani dosti ke naate omi se sulah karwaane ko kahata he to duje haath vah omi ko daali or keshu ke bich sandigdh rishte kii managasaint kahani sunaata he
 Meanwhile, the gifts received by Omi are missing the 'waistband' in Dolly, which Indu hides in her house
 langadaa ko jab yah baat maaloom hoti he to vah isi kamarband ke jariye kaiyon ke man main vishwaas-avishvaas ke ghere main daal detaa hai
 Meanwhile, there is a fatal attack on Tiwari Bhaisahab by Kichlu, who is the man of his rival Indore Singh
 omi badla lene kii thaanta hai, to langadaa ab vahi kamarband keshu ko billo chamanbahaar ke jariye kichlu ko dundh nikaalane or use markar omi se shaabaashi paane kii yukti detaa he
 But here too, the situation remains opposite to Keshu because the lame trick the Omi by saying how the waistband of Dolly reached Keshu's mashuka billo? Did Dolly intentionally hand over the waistband to Keshu? Omi comes to the house in disgust and questions Daly but he himself does not know why Omi is behaving rudely with him
 a few days before the wedding, seeing Omi and Dolly's love waning, Indu senses Omi's apprehensive mind to stop the wedding and taunts Dolly to take over
 is bich omi ko langadaa saath bhaisahab kii ore se indore singh ko maarane kaa aadesh miltaa he, kaam ko anjaam dene baad omi vahiin langadaa ko peetate hue kahata he ki vah daali or keshu ke bich sandigdhta kaa pramaan de anyathaa maamla jhutha sabit hone par apni jaan ganvaaen
 On the wedding night, Lame confirms all of Omi's misgivings with his mischief that Dolly and Keshu have a truly illicit relationship
 omi is jhuthi bevafaayee se gussaye apni hi suhagaraat main badi crurata se daali ko maar detaa hai to vahiin langadaa apni bandook se omi ke aadesh par keshu ko goli maar detaa hai
 Dali, who is scared by the sound of the explosion, is shocked to find Daly dead when she enters Omi's room
 par vahiin maujud kamarband ko pahchaan indu kahati he kii yah to usne churaayaa tha
 Now both of them understand that the reason for the responsibility of all these people is lame who misled everyone in their crooked ways
 vishwasadhatt or tabaahi se gussai indu apane pati langadaa kii gardan dauli se kaat detii he to vahiin khud ko thaga or laachaar omi, ghayal keshu ke pahunchate hi khud ko goli maar aatmahatya karata he
 At the last sight, the helpless Keshu sees the swinging soulless doll and the dead Omi lying below
