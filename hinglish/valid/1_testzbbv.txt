 We need to do everything we can to help them contribute more easily
 Sorry for leaving this message in English, i make too many errors and it takes too long for me to write this much in Hindi
 namaskara,i want to say two things here
 Typing is definitely one of the biggest blockers for contributors but i think that enough good options are available now
 On my talk page on English wikipedia, when dagizza invited me to contribute to Hindi Wikipedia, he gave me some links, some of which i like very much
 i am reposting part of his message here: i have some sites that convert online ->
 i also have some sites where you can download a simple converter
 Eg
 Writing Teraa naam kyaa hai? What is your name? And secondly, i would also support Chaupal chaoupal for Village Pump

 - Abhishek Pandey 18:41, 2 November 2006 a user left a comment at mediawiki talk:recentchangestext that international numerals are more useful for a greater number of people
 i agree, and since they're derived from Indian numerals anyway, i don't see the harm
 Our mission is to provide a useful reference work, not to preserve numerals that aren't as commonly used

--eukesh 16:36, 24 navambar 2006 i have some problem
 When i search for laddakh on Google, i get 149 results
 But when i search for laddakh on Google, i get no results at all
 What is the difference
 i believe that this is a problem with the nukta 
 Because when i search for azaad on Google i get 10,100 results
 But when i search for azaad on Google i only get 620 results
 On bhashaindia Hindi IME, it only gives the results on Google with the lowest results
 i only get more results if i go into Word, insert->symbol->font: Mangal, double-click on ja / k / kha, and then 
 What has happened? Please give your thoughts

 sarvat parvaton main ek sadak The Sarwat mountain or Sarat mountain, called Jabal al-sarwat in Arabic, is a range running along the western coast of the Arabic peninsula
 yah uttar main jordan-saudi arab kii seemaa se shuru hokar saudi arab or yaman se guzarate hue dakshin main adan kii khadi tak pahonchte hai
 These hijaz are considered part of the hills
 sarvat shrunkhlaa kaa uttari hissaa hijaaz kshetra main sthit he isliye ise 'saraat al-hijaaz' kehete hai
 The mountains of Sarat al-hijaz are mostly less than 2,100 meters in height
 shrunkhlaa kaa madhya bhaag 'saraat aseer' or dakshini bhaag 'saraat al-yaman' kehalaate hai or inke pahaad 3,300 meter se upar tak pahonchte hai
 The highest mountain in the Sarwat mountains is the 3,666 meter high Jabal al-nabi Shueb mountain
 yah yaman main sthit or puure arabi prayadweep kaa sabase unchaa pahaad bhi he
 Both the major Islamic pilgrimage centers Mecca and Yemen's capital, Sana, are located in the Sarawat mountainous region
 sarvat pahaad arabi prayadweep kii sabase badi pahari shrunkhlaa he
 Its mountains are stone and some shrubs are grown on them
 kam aayu kaa hone se kai sthanon par chattaane or pathar nokile hai, haalanki anya jagahon par hawa-pani ke prabhaav se gol bhi ho chuke hai
 Some geographers hold that the mountains of Syria and Lebanon in the far north are in fact the best end of the chain, but others disagree
 sabhi maanate hai ki uttari saudi arab main jordan kii seemaa se yah shuru hote hai phir tat kii barabari main dakshin kii ore chalate hai
 Upon coming to Medina, it reduces and disappears, but only a short time later it starts again near Taif
 or dakshin main aseer praant main yah oonchaai pakadaney lagate hai or kuch unchaaiyaan 3,000 meter se zaraa kam tak pahunch jaati hai
 Yet here it seems less a series of isolated hills and more on the edge of a high plateau east of the coastal plain of Tihamah

 Every promise or agreement which is enforceable by law or which can be obeyed by law is called a contract
 vartmaan sanvida kii visheshta uski kanoonee manyata he
 Promotion, agreement or maintenance of Kaul has been given great importance in the whole world and especially in India
 bhartiya itihaas main vachanpaalan ke liye putr ko vanvaas or swayan mrityu kaa varan karanevaale dasharath kii gaatha lokprasiddh he
 The medieval history of Rajasthan is steeped in this bright tradition
 parantu is vachanpaalan kaa aadhyatmik or naitik mulya rahaa he, iske peeche kanoon kaa haath nahin tha or na isko koi vaidhanik manyata praapt thi
 But gradually, the experience of pledging in business relations and the need to give legal recognition to it, along with the decline of values and morals, the society has experienced this and that is why the pledge in moral and spiritual terms has become secondary, following the statutory recognized business utterances Importance gained prominence
 vyavsaayik or kanoonee drushti se is sambandh main rome kaa kanoonee itihaas rochak he
 The oldest form of contract was there
 apane mul rup main yah udhaar vastuvikray se sambandhit tha
 Gradually it started being used for loans too
 isaki katipay aupchaariktaayen thim jinke bina kii purnataa praapt nahin hoti thi
 In India also, there are references in Narada and Jupiter's texts about the relationship of commodity, debt, partnership and success
 kintu vartmaan sanvida kaa swaroop usase bhinn he, yadhyapi uske vikaas kii kadi unase bhi jodi ja sakati he
 The current contract is characterized by its legal validity
 vah prayek vachan athwa qaraar jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey ho athwa jiskaa kanoon dwaara paalan karaayaa ja sake, sanvida he
 In ancient times, this legal recognition was not a special force but the emphasis was that if any formality was reduced from its formalities then the contract would not be completed
 yadhyapi apane vibhinn roopon main sanvida kaa prachlan samaaj ke vyavsaayik sambandhon main tha parantu "sanvida" shabd kaa anveshan bahut baad main hua
 The word contract is very broad
 sanvida ke hi ang vikray, rin, bandhak, nikshep, saajhedaari, abhikartrutv, vivaah aadi bhi hai
 But in its present form the contract has assumed new legal meaning
 bharatvarsh main iskaa adhinium san 1872 i
 main bana or sanvidaaon kaa niyaman usee bhartiya sanvida adhinium dwaara hota he
 Therefore, Indian courts are now bound to follow this written law in the case of contract
 vyavasthaaon kii vyakhya ke liye unhen isi adhinium kaa adhyayan karke upyukt arth or mantavya nikaalnaa chahie
 The Indian Contract Act is based on the British Contract Act, but the British Contract Act can be availed only if either the Indian Contract Act is silent on a question or its system is unclear and British law is not inconsistent with the Indian condition and social status
 apane vartmaan rup main sanvida ek vidhik vachan yaa kanoon dwaara pravartaneey qaraar he
 It has two essential elements - qaraar or Quality of making it effective by law
 jab kam se kam do vyakti kisi kaary ke karne athwa usase virat rahane ke sambandh main ekamat hote hai to use qaraar kaha jaataa he
 The agreement requires at least two parties
 yadi "a" na "ba" se prastaav kiya ki "ba" "a" kaa ek chitra bana de to vah "ba" ko is kaary hetu paanch sau rupe degaa
 This is proposed by "A"
 yadi "ba" yah sweekaar kar le ki paanch saura rupe main vah "a" ke liye uskaa chitra bana degaa to yah ek aisa qaraar hua jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey he or use prabhavakaari banaaya ja saktaa he
 That is, a person cannot make an agreement alone, it is necessary for the agreement to have the mental unity of the common side on the matters related to the agreement
 taatpary yah he ki qaraar sambandhi prayek baat ke sambandh main ubhay paksh uskaa ek hi arth samajhen
 It should not happen that one side understands one meaning and the other side understands the other meaning
 "a" ke paas do motorcarein hai, ek ford or duusari shevarlyt
 He wants to sell his Ford car for five thousand
 usne apni us car ko bechney kaa prastaav "ba" se kiya
 But "B", considering it a "chevrolet" car, agreed to buy it
 yah qaraar nahin hoga kyonki "a" or "ba" main motorcar ke sambandh main maansik ekaatmakataa nahin hui
 "A" from Motorcar understood Ford Motorcar and "B" as Chevrolet Car
 uparyukt kathan se spasht he ki prastaav hi sweekruti ke uparant qaraar banataa he
 There are different types of proposals but generally they are classified into five categories: 1
 vishisht prastaav, jab koi prastaav nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se kiya jaataa he, tab use vishisht prastaav kehete hai
 Since the offer is made to a certain person or persons, the person accepting it will be called the acceptor
 isamen sweekruti kii soochna swikarta dwaara prastaavak ko dena aavashyak he
 2
 a general proposal is a proposal that is not made by a certain person or persons, but a person of the world can accept it
 isi liye vishisht prastaav kii bhanti isamen sweekruti kii soochna kaa prastaavak ko diya janaa anivaary nahin hota
 Approval of this proposal is considered to be the only thing that is revealed and desired in the proposal
 3
 spasht prastaav ve prastaav he jo maukhik yaa likhit rup main hri parantu spashtat: hri kiye jaaen
 4
 Indicative proposals These proposals are made not by words but by actions
 yatriyon ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko tikat ke badale le jane kaa prastaav, railgadee ko stesan par aana hi he
 It is also an example of a general proposition because its acceptor is not predetermined
 5
 anwarat prastaav is prastaav main nishchit dar se 5000 man gehun kii aapurti kaa prastaav
 Even after acceptance of this proposal, one party cannot be compelled to buy whole wheat immediately or the other party will sell it
 prastaav kii hi bhanti or uske anuroop sweekruti kii koi vishesh vidhi yaa pranali nirdhaarit karata he, vahaan sweekruti kaa us vidhi yaa pranali nirdhaarit karata he, vahaan sweekruti kaa us vidhi yaa pranali dwaara sweekruti na ho to prastaavak ko usee pranali dwaara sweekruti dene par bal dena chahie
 But where there is no mention of any system or specific method of acceptance, acceptance can be done by any reasonable, relevant and appropriate system
 sweekruti bhi spasht arthath shabdon dwaara ho sakati he athwa sankethik rup main kaary dwaara
 The acceptance of the company's proposal by work is the seating of the passenger on the train going to the destination with the ticket
 keval maansik sweekruti maatr sweekruti nahin samajhi ja sakati
 Its expression in words or by action is also necessary
 prastaav main nirdisht kaaryon kaa karnaa bhi katipay prastaavon kii sweekruti maani jaati he
 But it is necessary that the acceptor knows the conditions of the proposer before doing this work
 yadi swikarta prastaav kii bina jaankaree ke hi vah kaary karata he jo prastaav main nirdisht he, to vah prastaav kii sweekruti nahin mana ja saktaa
 a person Goridutt sent his bookkeeper Lalman to search for his nephew
 lalman ke jane ke uparant gauridatt ne apane bhattije ko khoj laanevaale ke liye 501 rupe puraskaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 Lalman discovered the nephew of Munim Gauridutt and demanded the award
 nirnay yah hua ki chunki lalman ko ladke kii khoj ke purv puraskaar kii shart kii soochna nahin thi, na puraskaar prapti kii baat hi gyaat thi, at: khoe hue ladke ko khoj laane kaa lalman kaa kaary gauridatt ke prastaav kii sweekruti nahin mana ja saktaa Accepting the profit arising from the proposal is also considered to be acceptance of the offer in appropriate conditions
 varanasi se prayag kii bas main baithkar janaa hi bas maalik ke prastaav kii sweekruti he or swikarta bas kaa kiraaya dene ko baadhya he
 Approval should be in the case of the proposal being upheld
 yadi prastaav nishprabhav ho chukaa he yaa prastaavak dwaara khandit kiya yaa waapas liya ja chukaa he to sweekruti bhi nirarthak or prabhaavaheen hogi
 The information of the proposer is required to be accepted by the acceptor and the acceptance of the offer to the proposer
 prastaav kii soochna jab us vyakti ko praapt ho jaae jiske prati prastaav kiya jaataa he tab prastaav kaa sanvahan yaa sanchaar purna samajha he
 "A" sent the letter "B" in his watch 150) by offering to sell "B"
 jyonhi "k" kaa patr "kha" ko praapt hoga, "k" ke prastaav kaa sanvahan purna ho jayega
 Separation is separate for acceptance
 jab swikarta apni sweekruti prastaavak ke paas is prakaar preshit kar de ki uskaa waapas lenaa swikarta ke vash main na rahe, to prastaavak ke viruddh sweekruti prastaavak ke paas pahunch jaae
 In the above example, convection of your acceptance by "B" will be deemed complete but not against the acceptor
 swikarta ke viruddh sweekruti ke viruddh sweekruti kaa sanvahan tab purna hoga jab swikti prastaavak ke paas pahunch jaae
 In the above example, the acceptance of "B" by the letter "B" will be banned against the proposer named "A" but not against the acceptor "B"
 "kha" ke viruddh sanvahan kii purnataa tab hogi jab uski sweekruti kaa patr "k" ko praapt ho jaae
 When the proposer and the acceptor are present in front of each other, there is no complication in the convection, but when both are in two places, the medium of convection is by post or letter
 uparyukt kathan se yah spasht he ki prastaav kaa patr prastaavak dwaara chode jate hi vah purna nahin hota varan swikarta ke paas pahunchan par hi purna hota he
 This also leads to the conclusion that there is no complication in convection if the offeror and the acceptor are present before each other, but until the acceptor leaves their acceptance letter in the post because then the withdrawal of acceptance is outside the confessor's authority
 goes
 swikarta dwaara sweekrutipatr dak main chhodte har prastaav prastaavak ke viruddh purna ho jaataa he
 It has been said above that acceptance is complete against the acceptor when the proposer receives it
 prastaavak ko praapt hone ke purv swikarta apni sweekrutipatr daakkhaane main chode jate ho swikarta ke viruddh bhi purna ho jaataa he
 Acceptance is also effective if it arrives late or gets lost on the way, as it is believed that inadvertence or mistake of the Department of Posts does not justify any effect on the parties to the contract
 parantu yadi sanvahan ke liye patr dak main na daalkar postman ko de diya jaae to yah paryaapt sanvahan nahin kyonki prayek vyakti ke patr ko lekar dak main chhodana postman ke kartavyon main sammilit nahin he
 According to Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act 1872, all such agreements are considered contracts which qaraar karne yogya pakshon kii Be done with independent consent, jinka pratifal or uddeshy vaid ho or jo The Act should not have been declared by the said Act
 isi dhara main yah bhi spasht kar diya gaya he ki uparyukt paribhaasha kaa prabhaav aise kisi kanoon par nahin padegaa, By which a contract must be written, or with the testimony of registered witnesses
 aise sabhi vyakti sanvida karne yogya maane jate hai jo vyask hon, swasth mastishkvaale hon or kisi kanoon dwaara sanvida karne ke ayogy na tehraae gaye hon
 As a result avyask, Persons with deformed minds or those who are frantic, stupid and drunk, or aise vyakti jo kanoon dwaara sanvida karne ke ayogy tehraae gaye hon, yatha videshi shatru, videshi samrat athwa unke pratinidhi, desh ke shatru, apradhi aadi sanvida nahin kar sakate
 a non-practicing person cannot decide his own profit and loss with independent intelligence
 at: vah sanvida karne yogya nahin mana gaya he
 If the deformity is temporary in the person with deformed heart, or if the deformity is temporary in the person with brain, the brain is deformed and sometimes healthy, then such a person is not in the deformal but is a worthy party to the contract in the time of recovery of the brain
 1 The right of the offender to contract at the time of imprisonment is suspended but for the purpose of imprisonment or forgiveness Shchat her ability to contract is retrieving
 diwalia ghoshit vyakti bhi sanvida karne kii yogyata se vanchit mana jaataa he
 a key requirement of the contract is to have independent consent of the parties to the contract
 yadi sahmati swatantra nahin he to sanvida usase prabhavit hogi
 Consent is considered independent when it 1
 balpravartan yaa traas, 2
 unwanted effects, 3
 chhalkapat, 4
 Has not been influenced or received by a misleading statement, or fallacy
 balpravartan yaa traas kii paribhaasha bhartiya sanvida adhinium kii dhara main di gai he
 According to him, there are four forms of force or tragedy: bhartiya dand vidhaan dwaara varjit or dandaneey kaary karnaa yaa Threatening to do, whether or not the place where this act is done or not, kisi bhi vyakti kii sampatti avaidh rup se roak rakhana; athwa Threatening to stop
 is balpravartan yaa traas kaa uddeshy kisi vyakti ko sanvida kaa paksh bananaa hi hona chahie
 The definition of undue influence is given in Section 16 of the Contracts Act
 uske anusaar vah sanvida avaanchit prabhaav dwaara prerit kahi jaati he jiske pakshon ke sambandh aise hon ki ek paksh duusare paksh kii ichha se apni us vishisht sthiti kaa prayog kare
 The relationship between parents and children, guardians and parents, lawyers and clients, doctors and patients, gurus and disciples, etc
 are similar in that the first party inspires the other's wishes because of their specific relationship
 avaanchit prabhaav siddh karne ke liye yah bhi siddh karnaa aavashyak he ki vastut: vishisht sthitiwale paksh ke duusare paksh par apni vishesh sthiti kaa prayog apane anuchit laabh ke liye kiya
 If this is not proved, a contract will not be deemed to be affected or abandoned by undue influence only because of the specific situation
 yah sanvida adhinium kii dhara 17 main varnit he
 According to him, the following actions shall be called fraud in order to induce the other party or his agent to cheat or trick or join the contract by any party of the contract or by his agent or by his agent: k) kisi asaty baat ko, jisaki satyata main use vishwaas na ho, tathy batalaana, B) to hide a fact which he does not know or believe; ga) aisa vachan dena jise puraa karne kii ichha na ho; D) to do or be dissuaded from an act which the law specifically declares as treachery; ng) dhokhaa dene laayak anya kaary karnaa
 In relation to the agreement, it has been said that there is a need to have a mental consensus between the parties
 bhranti isi se sambandhit dosha he
 In this, one side understands an object or thing and the other side understands the other thing or thing
 falswaroop upree dhang se dekhne main to sanvida kaa nirmaan prathit hota he parantu bhranti ke kaaran vastut: koi sanvida hoti nahin he
 There are many types of these misconceptions
 vishaysaamagree ke sambandh main bhranti kaa udhaaharan purvaprasang main shevarlyt or ford motor kaaron ke dwaara diya gaya he
 Similarly, there is confusion in the identity of the parties to the contract
 "k" ne jise "kha" samajhakar sanvida kii yadi vah vastut: "kha" nahin varan "ga" tha to yah paksh kii pahchaan kii bhranti he
 The nature or meaning of the contract can also be confused
 agar kisi baad kaa ek paksh baad main avasar lene kaa aavedan patr bataakar kisi sandhipatr par duusare paksh kaa hastakshar kara letaa he to duusare paksh ko sanvida ke rup yaa prakruti ke vishay main bhranti hoti he
 In such a case, the signature maker's mind is not with his signature
 prasanvida ke liye pratifal ek aavashyak tatv he
 There can be no covenant without consideration; And even if it is, it is disarmed or illegal
 pratifal bhi vaid hona chahie
 For example "A", "B" are charged Rs 5000 for killing "S"
 And "B" pledge to kill
 yahan yah sanvida ni:satv he kyonki iskaa pratifal hatya kanoon dwaara varjit he
 Thus the following types of returns are invalid - 1
 aise pratifal jo kanoon varjit hai
 If any consideration is explicitly or symbolically forbidden by law, then the covenant made on the basis of it is void
 yah uparyukt udhaaharan se spasht ho jayega
 2
 If there is any consideration which disrupts or nullifies any arrangement of an act, then that consideration shall be deemed to be invalid
 3
 jo pratifal kapatpurna hote hai, ve avaidh samajhe jate hai
 4
 The reward by which a person's body or property is damaged is illegal
 udhaaharan ke liye a ek samachaarpatr ke sampadak ko paanch sau rupaya dene kaa vachan detaa he yadi sampadak ba ke sambandh main apmanjanak vivaran chaape
 The reward here is illegal because it hurts B's reputation
 5
 aise pratifal jo aniatik hote hai, avaidh hai
 6
 Returns against public policy are illegal, such as trading with the enemy
 lokseva ko haani pahunchaane kii pravriti rakhanevaali sanvida, dandaneey aparaadhon se sambandhit mukademon kaa galaa ghotanevaali sanvida ni:satv hoti he
 Contracts tending to misuse statutory action, such a contract is against morality, or a trade contract or someone who is against morality, or a trade contract or a contract to prevent an individual from marrying, etc
 also against public policy And are non-existent
 uddeshy evam pratifal main se ek kaa bhi avaidh hona sanvida ko ni:satv kar detaa he
 If the purpose of the contract is partially invalid, the contract becomes void even if its illegal share can be separated from the valid part
 yadi pratifal yaa uddeshy kaa avaidh ansh vaid ansh se alag kiya ja sake to vaid ansh pravartaneey hoga or avaidh ansh ni:satv hoga
 Eg "B" pledged to give "A" 2000 rupees by a covenant, out of which Rs 1500 was an old loan and Rs 500 was a loss in gambling
 isamen vaid bhaag kaa avaidh bhaag se pruthak kiya ja saktaa he; atev yah pratigyaptr 1500 rupye ke liye maanya hoga kintu 500) ke liye ni:satv hoga
 Contracts declared as disobedience under the Indian Contract Act cannot be enforceable by law, although other elements of the contract must be fully in place

 matsyavataar Matsyavatar bhagwaan vishnu kaa avatar he jo unke das avtaron main se ek he
 Vishnu is said to be a follower and hence he embodies various avatars to protect the universe
 jab sansar ko kisi prakaar kaa khatra hota he tab bhagwaan vishnu avatarit hote hai
 When Prajapati Brahma's knowledge of the Vedas came out of the mouth of Brahmand's periodic disintegration, Asura Hayagreeva stole and swallowed that knowledge
 tab bhagwaan vishnu apane praathmik avatar matsay ke rup main avateern hue or swayan ko raja satyavrath manu ke saamne ek choti, laachaar machhlee bana liya
 Satyavrat was offering arghya to Suryadev in the morning when a fish asked him to keep me in his kamandal
 dayaa or dharm ke anusaar is raja ne machhlee ko apane kamandal main le liya or ghar kii ore nikle, ghar pahonchte tak vah matsay us kamandal ke aakaar kaa ho gaya, raja nen ise ek paatr par rakhaa parantu kuch samay baad vah matsay us paatr ke aakaar kii ho gai
 Finally, when the king put him in the sea, he covered the whole sea
 us sunahari-rang machhlee ne apane divya pahchaan ujagar kii or apane bhakt ko yah suchit kiya ki us diwas ke thik saatven din pralay aayega tatpashchaat vishwa kaa nayaa shrrijan hoga ve satyavrath ko sabhi jadi-bhuti, beej or pashuon, sapt rishi aadi ko ikattha karke prabhu dwaara bheje gaye naav main sanchit karne ko kaha
 Then by killing this huge fish Hayagriva saved Vedo from anonymity and gave it to Brahma
 jab brahma apane neend se uthe jo paralay ke ant main tha, ise bramh kii raat pukaara jaataa hai, jo gananaa ke aadhaar par 4 320 000 000 saalo tak chalata he
 When the tide began to devour the universe, a huge boat arrived, on which everyone boarded
 matsay bhagwaan ne use sarpraj vasuki ko door banaakar band liya or sumeru parvat kii ore prasthaan kiya
 On the way, Lord Matsya Narayan narrated the Matsya Purana to Manu and in this way the Lord protected everyone from the Holocaust, and saved the breeds of plants and creatures and propagated the learning of Matsya Purana in the new age
 bhagwaan matsay narayan veda rupi baalkon ko bachaate hue, raaj ravi verma dwaara

 Enterprise resource planning is a company-wide computer software system used for sharing and managing all resources, information and business functions through shared data repositories
 ek ERP pranali main ek seva unmukh vaastukala hoti he jisamen anukhandi hardware or software kii ikaiyaan tathaa "sevaayen" hoti hai jo ek local aria network par sanchaar karti hai
 This modular design allows a business to add or change modules, while maintaining data integrity, in a shared database that can be centralized or distributed
 ] The ERP initials originated as an extension of MRP and CIM
 anusandhan evam vishleshan form gartner dwaara 1990 main isko prachlit kiya gaya tha
 ERP systems now try to cover all the core functions of the enterprise, whatever the organization's business or manifesto
 in pranaaliyon ko ab gaiyr-utpaadan vyapaaron, gaiyr-laabh sanghathanon or sarkaron main paaya ja saktaa he
 To be called an ERP system, a software package must provide the functions of at least two systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek software package jo vetan or lekha, donon kaary pradaan karata ho use takneekee taur par ek ERP software package kaha ja saktaa he
 Examples of modules in an ERP that previously used to be independent applications include: product life-cycle management, supply chain management, warehouse management, customer relationship management, sales order processing, online sales, financial, human resources, and decision support system
 kuch sanghathan - aamtaur par ve jinke paas software utpaadon ko ekikrut karne ke liye paryaapt aatanrik iti kshamta he- ERP pranali ke keval kuch hisson ko lagu karne kaa chayan karte hai or apni anya aplicoshan aavashyaktaaon ke liye ERP yaa swatantra pranaaliyon ke bahya antarafalak viksit karte hai
 For example, they may choose to use the human resource management system of one vendor and perform integration between systems themselves

 Ideally, ERP provides a single database containing all the data for software modules, including: graahakon, aapurtikartaaon or karmchaariyon ke liye data godaam or vibhinn swayan seva antarafalak abhigam niyantran - prakriya nishpaadan hetu praadhikaar staron ke aadhaar par upyogkarta visheshadhikaar anukulan - prakriya pravaah main vistaar, yoga or parivartan kii purti hetu The term enterprise resource planning is originally derived from manufacturing resource planning, which comes from material requirement planning
 MRP, ERP main tab parivartit hua jab "rootings" software vaastukala kaa ek pramukh hissaa ban gaya or ek company kii kshamta yojana gatividhi bhi maanak software gatividhiyon kaa ek hissaa ban gayi
 ERP systems typically manage a company's manufacturing, logistics, distribution, freight, shipping, invoicing and accounting
 ERP software kai vyavsaayik gatividhiyon jaise bikri, vipanan, vitaran, billing, utpaadan, maal prabandhan, gunvattta prabandhan or maanav sansaadhan prabandhan ke niyantran main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 The 1990s saw a huge increase in sales of ERP systems as companies faced the Y2K problem in their older systems
 kai companiyon ne is avasar kaa laabh uthaate hue apni puraani soochna pranaaliyon ko ERP pranaaliyon ke saath badal diya
 This sales boom led to a slowdown in 1999, by which time most companies had already implemented their Y2K solutions
 ERP ko aksar galat tareeke se back offis pranali samajha jaataa he, jo yah darshata he ki graahakon or aam janata kaa isse koi pratyaksh sarokaar nahin he
 This is compared with front office systems, such as customer relationship management systems that connect directly with customers, or e-business systems such as e-commerce, e-government, e-telecom and e-finance, or supplier relationships management systems
 ERP kaa upyog puure udhyam tathaa uske kisi bhi prakaarya main kiya ja saktaa he
 All functional departments involved in activities or production are integrated into a system
 nirmaan, bhandaaran, laugisticks or soochna praudyogiki ke alaava isamen lekha, maanav sansaadhan, marketing or ranneetik prabandhan bhi shaamil honge

 Most ERP vendors' software packages accommodate best systems
 ek ERP pranali ko lagu karte vakt, sanghathan software kaa anurupan karne, yaa apni vyapaar prakriyaaon ko pradipt software main maujuud "sarvottam prathaon" ke anuroop sanshodhan karne ke bich kisi ek kaa chayan kar sakate hai
 Prior to ERP, software was developed according to business processes
 adhikansh ERP pranaaliyon kii jatilta or ERP karyanvayan main asafalataa ke nakaaratmak parinaamon ke kaaran, adhikansh vikritaon nen apane software main "sarvottam prathaon" ko shaamil kar liya he
 According to the seller, these "best practices" are the most efficient way for a specific business process in an integrated enterprise-wide system
 lugvigshaafen uniwarsity of aplide science ke ek adhyayan ne 192 companiyon kaa surveykshan kiya or yah nishkarsh nikaala ki jin companiyon ne udyog jagat kii sarvshereshth prathaon ko lagu kiya he unamem concigareshan, pralekhan, pareekshan or prashikshan jaise mahatvapurn pariyojna kaaryon main kami aayi he
 In addition, the use of best practices reduced risk by more than 71% compared to other software
 sarvottam prathaon kaa upyog IFRS, sarbence-oxle yaa besel II jaisi aavashyaktaaon ke anupaalan ko aasaan banaata he
 They can also help where the process is an object like electronic money transfer
 aisa isliye hai kyonki vidhaayi or camodity saamagree ko pakadaney or report karne kii prakriya ko ERP software ke andar aasaani se kodit kiya ja saktaa he or tatpashchaat vishwaas ke saath unhen un tamaam vyavsaayon main doharaaya ja saktaa he jinaki vyavsaayik aavashyaktaaen samaan hon
 All functional units of businesses have a wide scope of applications and processes; ERP software systems are produced that are typically complex and demand significant changes in the working practices of employees
 ERP software kaa kriyanvayan "aatanrik" kaushal ke liye aam taur par bahut jatil hota he, isliye yah vaanchhneeya bhi he or isaki salaah bhi di jaati he ki in pranaaliyon ko lagu karne hetu peshewar rup se prashikshit bahya salaahkaaron kii madad lee jaye
 yah aamtaur par laagat kam karne kaa sabase prabhavi tarika he
 There are three types of services that can be hired - counseling, adaptation and support
 The duration of implementing an ERP system depends on the size of the business, the number of modules, the extent of customization, the scope of change and the customer's willingness to assume ownership of the project
 ERP pranaliyaan anukhandit hoti hai, atah yah aavashyak nahin he ki inako ek hi baar main lagu kiya jaye
 inhen vibhinn staron yaa charnon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 a typical project requires approximately 14 months and around 150 consultants
 ek choti pariyojna ko 3-9 maheene ke bheetar yojanabaddh karke lagu kiya ja saktaa he; jabaki, ek bade, bahu-kshetreey or bahu-deshiy karyanvayan main varshon lag sakate hai
 The duration of the implementation depends very much on the desired amount of customization
 ERP pranaaliyon ke karyanvayan hetu companiyaan aksar ERP vikreta yaa tritiy-paksh paraamarsh companiyon kii sahaayta leti hai
 These companies typically provide professional services in three areas: consulting, customization and support
 Customer organizations can employ independent program management, business analysis, change management and UAT specialists to ensure that their business needs remain a priority during implementation
 ek ERP karyanvayan kii safalataa kaa nirdhaaran karne main data sthanantaran sabase mahatvapurn gatividhiyon main se ek he
 As many important decisions are taken before transfer, it becomes necessary to proceed in a very planned manner
 durbhagyavash, data pravaas ek ERP karyanvayan ke utpaadan charan se pehle kii aakhri gatividhi hoti he, atah samay kii kami ke kaaran isapar bahut kam dhyaan diya jaataa he
 The following steps of data migration strategies can be helpful for the success of an ERP implementation: ERP vikritaon ne apni pranaaliyon ko maanak vyapaar prakriyaaon ke anusaar dizin kiya he, sarvottam vyavsaayik paddatiyon ke aadhaar par
 alag vikritaon kii prakriyaayein alag prakaar kii hoti hai lekin ve sabhi ek maanak, anukhandit prakruti kaa hi anusaran karti hai
 As a result, companies that want to implement ERP systems are forced to adapt their organizations to standard procedures rather than customizing ERP packages according to their existing processes
 ERP karyanvayan shuru karne se pehle vartmaan vyavsaayik prakriyaaon kaa nakshaa banane kii upeksha, ERP pariyojnaon kii vifaltaa kaa ek mukhya kaaran he
 It is therefore important that organizations do a thorough analysis of business processes before selecting and implementing an ERP vendor
 is vishleshan dwaara maujuuda sabhi vyavsaayik prakriyaaon kaa nakshaa taiyaar karnaa chahie, taaki aise ERP vikreta kaa chayan kiya ja sake jiske maanak anukhand sthapit sanghathan ke saath sarvaadhik nikatataa se jude hon
 adhik prakriyaatmak ekikaran praapt karne ke liye tab ridizin kaa karyanvayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Research indicates that the risk of mismatch in business processes can be reduced by: ERP karyanvayan un sanghathanon main adhik dushkar hota he jahaan lagbhag swatantra vyavsaayik ikaiyaan hoti hai, prayek ikai apane nafe nuksaan ke liye swayan jimmedaar hoti he, kyonki unamem se prayek kii alag prakriyaayein, vyapaar niyam, data shabdaarth-vigyaan, praadhikaar padanukram or nirnay centre hote hai
 Solutions include coordinating requirements by local change management professionals or, if this is not possible, federated implementation using loosely integrated examples that are specifically configured and / or adapted to meet local needs
 ERP kaa ek nuksaan aamtaur par yah bataaya jaataa he ki manakikrut ERP anukhandon ke saath mail khaane ke liye vyavsaayik prakriyaaon ke parivartan se pratispardhi shreshthata main kami aa sakati he
 Documented evidence exists where this actually happened, while other cases show that following ERP processes to the fullest can actually enhance sustainable competitive superiority
 ek ERP pranali kaa vinyas asal main keval in baton ke bich santulan baithaana hi he ki aap is pranali se kya kaam karwaanaa chaahate hai or yah pranali aapako kis prakaar kaam karne detii he
 Start with which modules to install, then integrate the system using configuration tables to make the best possible adjustments with your company's processes
 anukhand- zyaadaatar pranaliyaan maatr isliye anukhandit hoti hai taaki kuch prakaaryon ko karyanvit kiya ja sake, lekin anya nahin hoti hai
 Some common modules such as finance and accounting are adopted by almost all companies; While other modules such as human resource management are not required by companies, they are not adopted
 udhaaharan ke liye ek seva pradaan karne vaali company ko sambhawatah nirmaan anukhand kii aavashyaktaa nahin padegi
 kai baar companiyaan kisi anukhand ko isliye nahin apanaatin kyonki unke paas swayan kii pranali maujuud he jo unki najar main behatar he
 In general, the more modules selected, the more the integration benefit will increase, but at the same time the cost, risk and related changes will also increase
 vinyas talikaay- ek vinyas talika company ko is pranali ke kisi vishisht pahalu ko apane chaynit vyavsaay ke tareeke ke anusaar dhaalane main sakasham banaati he
 For example, an organization may choose the type of inventory accounting - FIFO or LIFO -, or by whom it wants to identify revenue - geographic unit, product, or distribution channel
 What happens when the options provided by the system are not appropriate? In such a situation, the company has two options, but both are not ideal
 vah udhyam pranali kooton ko punah likh sakati he, yaa maujuuda pranali kaa istemaal karti rahe or iske tathaa nayi udhyam pranali ke bich anuphaalak banaaye
 Both options will increase the cost and time of the implementation process
 In addition they can also reduce the importance of integration benefits of this system
 pranali ke anukulan kii maatra jitna zyada hoga, aapurtikartaaon or graahakon ke bich sanchaar kii sahajata utani hi kam hoti jaayegi
 Many organizations did not have sufficient internal skills to implement an ERP project
 iske parinamswaroop kai sanghathan ERP karyanvayan ke liye paraamarsh sevaayen pradaan karne lage
 Typically, a consulting team was responsible for the entire ERP implementation, including planning, training, testing, implementation, and delivery of customized modules
 Examples of customization include additional product training; Creating process promoters and workflows; Expert advice on how to use ERP in business; System optimization; And aid writing reports, complex data findings or business intelligence implementation
 adhikansh madhyam aakaar vaali companiyon ke liye karyanvayan kii laagat, ERP upyogkarta license kii likhit keemat se lekar uske dogune tak ho sakati he 
 badi companiyaan, vishesh rup bahu-kshetreey yaa bahu-deshiy companiyaan, kriyaanvayan ke liye aksar upyogkarta license kii laagat se kaaphi adhik kharch karti hai- bahu-kshetreey karyanvayan ke liye teen se ponch guna tak kharch asaamaanya nahin he
 Unlike most single-purpose applications, ERP packages include full source code from the beginning and are shipped with vendor-supported team ides for customization and expansion of illumination code
 ERP ke praarambhik varshon ke dauraan, jab ek sambhavit graahak swayan ke anuthe samaadhaan kaa aatanrik rup se vikaas karne par vichaar kar rahaa hota tha, yaa "sarvshereshth nasl" ke kai aplications ke ekikaran dwaara prakaarya-vyapee samaadhaan ko ekatra kar rahaa hota tha, us vakt paripakv upkarnon kii guarantee or vyapak anukulan ke liye sahaayta ek mahatvapurn bikri tark hua karata tha
 ERP vendors have tried to reduce customization requirements by providing pre-existing "configuration" features to meet the need for customers to change how the core system works as soon as they exit the packing box
 anukulan or vinyas ke bich mukhya antaron main shaamil hai: According to this analysis, simulating an ERP package can be unexpectedly expensive and complex, and may delay the realization of the obvious benefits of an integration system
 tathaapi, ek ERP suut kaa anurupan, vishisht kshetron main utkrushtataa ke liye gupt takneekon ko lagu karne kii gunjaaish pradaan karata he, saath hi yah sunishchit karata he ki kam samvedansheel kshetron main udyog jagat kii sarvottam prathaon ko lagu kiya ja sake
 In this context, "expansion" refers to the means by which the evoked ERP environment can be extended by third-party programs

 Since ERP applications usually involve complex rules that control the creation and transformation of master data, the implementation of some scenarios becomes very difficult

 yah prakaarya aamtaur par iti vibhaag ke sadasyon kii sahaayta se aatanrik rup se pradaan kiya jaataa he, yaa ek bahari visheshgy paraamarsh or seva company dwaara bhi pradaan kiya ja saktaa he
 In the absence of an ERP system, a large manufacturer may have multiple software applications that are unable to communicate or interface effectively with each other
 Functions that interface with each other include: ERP pranali, data ko ek sthaan par centrestha karti he
 Its benefits include: kuch suraksha suvidhaayen ek ERP pranali main shaamil rahati hai taaki audyogic jasusi jaise bahari aparaadh or gaban jaise andruni aparaadh ke viruddh suraksha pradaan kii ja sake
 For example, a scenario of data tampering could be that a disgruntled employee is deliberately keeping prices below their lowest level to manipulate the company's profits or harm in some other way
 
 ERP pranaliyaan aamtaur par is prakaar ke krityon ke viruddh aantarik niyantran kii suvidha pradaan karti hai
 ERP vendors are moving towards better integration with other types of information security tools

 Conservation, Research and News: chitra : Chandbardai was a heroic poet of Hindi literature and a friend of Prithviraj Chauhan
 unhone apane mitra kaa antim kshan tak saath diya
 Chandabardai was born in Lahore, he belonged to the Kaladi gotra of the caste Chandisa Rao Bhatt, later he became an honorable Sakha, royal poet and associate of Prithviraj, the well-known Hindu king of ajmer-delhi
 isse uskaa adhikansh jivan maharaja prithviraj chouhan ke saath dilli main beetaa tha
 The capital and the battlefield were with Prithviraj everywhere
 uski vidyamanata kaa kaal 13 veen sadi he
 Chandravardai's famous treatise is "prithvirajaraso"
 isaki bhashaa ko bhashaa-shastriyon ne pingal kaha he, jo rajasthan main brajabhasha kaa paryaay he
 Therefore, Chandavardai is considered the first great poet of Braj Bhasha Hindi
 'raso' kii rachana maharaj prithviraj ke yuddh-varnan ke liye hui he
 It describes their heroic wars and love affairs
 at: isamen vir or shringaar do hi ras he
 Chandabardai has composed this book like an eyewitness, but it is clear from the inscription evidence that there is an unknown poet who completes this work by describing the last moments of Chand and Prithviraj
 chandbardaai ko hindi kaa pehla kavi or unki rachana prithviraj raso ko hindi kii pehali rachana hone kaa sammaan praapt he
 Prithviraj Raso is the largest poetry book in Hindi
 isamen 10,000 se adhik chand hai or tatkaaleen prachlit 6 bhashaaon kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Detailed information about North Indian Kshatriya society and their traditions is found in this book, due to this it is also very important from a historical point of view
 ve bharat ke antim hindu samraat prithviraj chouhan tritiy ke mitra tathaa raajakavi the
 Prithviraj ruled Ajmer and Delhi from 1165 to 1192
 yahi chandbardaai kaa rachanakaal bhi tha
 His life was so mixed with the life of Prithviraj that it cannot be separated
 yuddh main, akhet main, sabha main, yatra main, sadaa maharaj ke saath rahete the or jahaan jo baaten hoti thim, sab main sammilit rahete the
 Even when Mohammad Ghori defeated Prithviraj Chauhan and took him captive to Ghazni, he could not control himself and went to Ghazni
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kaid main band prithviraj ko jab andhaa kar diya gaya to unhen is avasthaa main dekh kar inkaa hriday dravit ho gaya evam inhone gori ke vadh kii yojana banaayi
 Under the said scheme, he first won the heart of Ghori and then told Ghori that Prithviraj could wield a wrenching arrow
 isse prabhavit hokar mohammad gori ne prithviraj kii is kala ko dekhne kii ichha prakat kii
 On the day of the performance Chand Baradiyi sat on the stage with Ghori
 andhe prithviraj ko maidan main laayaa gaya evam unase apni kala kaa pradarshan karne ko kaha gaya
 As Prithviraj shot an arrow over an hour, Ghori's mouth suddenly said "wow! Wow !!" The word came out just what was it again
 Chandbardiyi immediately told Prithviraj in a couplet that where Ghori was sitting and at what height
 vah doha is prakaar tha: Four bamboo twenty four yards, Angul Ashta Praman! Ta Sultan is up, Chauhan does not miss out !! is prakaar chand bardaai kii sahaayta se se prithviraj ke dwaara gori kaa vadh kar diya gaya
 Prithviraj Raso composed by him is considered to be the first authentic poetry of Hindi language

 The Antarctic Treaty came into force from 1961 and by 2016, 53 countries had signed it
 is sandhi ke antargat antarctic ko ek vaigyanik sangrakshit kshetra ghoshit kar diya gaya or is mahadweep par kisi bhi prakaar kii sainik kaarywai par pabandi laga di gai
 Also, an annual "antarctic Treaty Consultation Meeting" tradition was initiated to decide on Antarctica cases

 The treaty said that no signer is neither withdrawing from his claim, neither accepting the claim of anyone else nor making any new claim
 misaal ke liye france antarctic ke aadeli dharti naamak kshetra ko apana hissaa maanata he lekin sandhi ke antargat vah is daawey ko kisi or se manwaane main aksham he
 On the other hand, India does not accept the sovereignty of any country over any region of Antarctica and considers the entire continent the property of the entire human race
 antarctic sandhi main do prakaar ke sadsy desh hai - paramarshi or aparamarshi 
 According to the treaty, when the Antarctic Treaty Consultation Meeting takes place every year, the consulting countries have the right to vote on the proposals, but non-diaspora members do not have this right
 paramarshi sadsy banane ke liye kisi desh ko yah dikhaanaa hota he ki vah antarctic main anusandhan karne main sakriya he
 One aspect of this activism is to establish a research center in Antarctica where scientific teams from that country can work and live

 In 2016, out of more than 200 total countries in the world, the Antarctic Treaty had 53 members, of which only 29 held consultative status

 Historians study historiography subjectively, such as history of India, history of Japanese Empire, etc
 itihaas ke mukhya aadhaar yugavishesh or ghatnasthal ke ve avshesh hai jo kisi na kisi rup main praapt hote hai
 Due to the multifaceted pervasiveness of life, it is inauspicious to paint the past era or society with the help of self-material
 saamagree jitani hi adhik hoti jaati he usee anupaat se beete yug tathaa samaaj kii ruparekha prastut karnaa saadhy hota jaataa he
 Notwithstanding adequate means, it cannot be said that the imaginary picture will certainly be pure or true

 maansik, kaalpanik athwa manamaane swaroop ko khadaa kar aitihaasik ghatnaon dwaara uske samarthan kaa praytn karnaa akshamya dosha hone ke kaaran sarvatha varjit he
 It is also necessary to remember that the creation of history is an intellectual constructive work, so the unnatural and the incomprehensible cannot be accommodated in evidence
 iske sivaa itihaas kaa dhyevishesh yathavat gyaan praapt karnaa he
 Reputation, publicity or dismantling of any particular principle or opinion or making it a means of running any kind of movement is misuse of history
 aisa karne se itihaas kaa mahatv hi nahin nasht ho jaataa, varan upkaar ke badale usase apkaar hone lagata he jiskaa parinaam antatogatva bhayaavah hota he

 is prakaar dinabhar bhukhe-pyaase shikari kaa vrath bhi ho gaya or shivlinga par belptr bhi chadh gaye
 At one o'clock in the night, a pregnant lady came to drink water at the pond
 shikari ne dhanush par tir chadhaakar jyon hi pratyancha khinchi, mrigi boli, 'main garbhini hum
 Will deliver soon tum ek saath do jeevon kii hatya karoge, jo thik nahin he
 i will give birth to a child and will be presented to you soon, then kill it
 ' shikari ne pratyancha dhili kar di or mrigi junglee jhaadiyon main lupt ho gai
 Shortly after, another antelope emerged from there
 shikari kii prasannataa kaa thikaana na rahaa
 After coming close, he put the bow on the arrow
 tab use dekh mrigi ne vinamratapurvak nivedan kiya, 'he pardhi! main thodi der pehle ritu se nivrutt hui hum
 i am lustful
 apane priy kii khoj main bhatak rahi hum
 i will meet my husband and come to you soon
 ' shikari ne use bhi jane diya
 He was perturbed over losing his prey twice
 vah chintaa main pad gaya
 The last hour of the night was passed
 tabhi ek anya mrigi apane bacchon ke saath udhar se nikali
 It was a golden opportunity for hunters
 usne dhanush par tir chadhaane main der nahin lagaai
 He was about to drop the arrow that the antelope said, 'O Pardhi!' i will return these children to their father
 is samay mujhe mat maaro
 The hunter laughed and said, leave the victim in front, i am not such a fool
 isse pehle main do baar apana shikaar kho chukaa hum
 My children must be suffering from hunger and thirst
 uttar main mrigi ne phir kaha, jaise tumhen apane bacchon kii mamata sata rahi he, thik vaise hi mujhe bhi
 Therefore, in the name of children, i am seeking life for a while
 he pardhi! meraa vishwaas kar, main inhen inke pita ke paas chhodkar turant lautne kii pratigya karti hum
 Hearing the deer's low voice, the hunter felt pity on him
 usne us mrigi ko bhi jane diya
 In the absence of hunting, the hunter sitting on the vine tree was being thrown down by breaking the bell-sheet
 pau fatne ko hui to ek hrisht-pusht mrug usee raste par aayaa
 The hunter thought that he would surely hunt it
 shikari kii tani pratyancha dekhakar mrigvinith swar main bolaa, he pardhi bhai! yadi tumne mujhase purv aane vaali teen mrigiyon tathaa chote-chote bacchon ko maar daalaa he, to mujhe bhi maarane main vilamb na karo, taaki mujhe unke viyog main ek kshan bhi dukh na sahanaa pade
 i am the husband of those deer
 yadi tumne unhen jeevandaan diya he to mujhe bhi kuch kshan kaa jivan dene kii krupa karo
 i will meet you and appear before you
 mrug kii baat sunate hi shikari ke saamne puri raat kaa ghatnachakra gum gaya, usne sari katha mrug ko suna di
 Then the deer said, 'the way my three wives have gone as promised, i will not be able to follow my religion with my death
 atah jaise tumne unhen vishwaasapaatr maanakar choda he, vaise hi mujhe bhi jane do
 i will appear before you soon with all of them
 ' upwas, raatri-jaagran tathaa shivlinga par belptr chadhane se shikari kaa hinsak hriday nirmal ho gaya tha
 Bhagavad Shakti was in him
 dhanush tathaa baan uske haath se sahaj hi chhot gaya
 Due to the compassion of Lord Shiva, his violent heart filled with compassionate feelings
 vah apane ateet ke karmon ko yaad karke pashchaatap kii jwaala main jalane laga
 Shortly afterwards, the antelope appeared before the family hunter, so that he could hunt them, but the hunter was very sorry for seeing such veracity, sattvikta and collective love of wild animals
 uske netron se aansuon kii jhadi lag gai
 By not killing that antelope family, the hunter removed his hard heart from living violence and made him soft and kind forever
 devloak se samast dev samaaj bhi is ghatana ko dekh rahe the
 As soon as the event ended, the Gods and Goddesses made flowers
 tab shikari tathaa mrug parivaar moksh ko praapt hue'

 In developed capitalist countries, as stated above, consumerist culture helps to keep the production process running and develop without breaking the capitalist values and structure
 lekin teesri duniya ke deshon main is samskruti kaa asar iske thik vipareet hota he
 In Third World countries like India where traditional production structure has been broken by imperialist contact and there is a need for rapid development of production to meet the basic needs of the people, the possibilities of development have been frustrated by the impact of consumerism
 pashchimi deshon ke sampark se in deshon main ek nayaa abhijaat varg paidaa ho gaya he jisane is upabhoktavaadi samskruti ko apana liya he
 This class has also aroused the hunger for those goods which are becoming available to the middle class and a section of skilled laborers in the developed society of the west
 in vastuon kii uplabdhi main unki saamaajik pratishtha main bhi badhotaree ho jaati he
 Therefore, this elite and its sighting has aroused a keen desire to get scooters, tvs, freezes and various kinds of goods and accessories in the lower middle class and lower middle class as well
 hamaare apane desh main iske do saamaajik parinaam hue hai
 Firstly, since this class occupies the top position in the politics of the country, the limited resources of the country are being used indiscriminately for the development of industries and facilities, instead of producing the items of common need of the people, so that the consumerist aspirations of this class To be fulfilled chunki utpaadan kaa yah kshetra ativiksit takneekee kaa or poonji pradhan he, in udyogon ke vikaas main videshon par nirbharta badhati he
 Imports of machines, technology and non-essential commodities erode our limited foreign exchange, and our largest economic instrument by which consumption has been able to accelerate the country's growth - that is, our manpower remains idle
 jin kshetron main desh kaa vishaal jan samudaay utpaadan main yogadan de saktaa he unki avhelnaa ke kaaran aam logon kii jeevanaster kaa yaa to vikaas nahin ho paata yaa vah neeche girtaa he
 Second, since consumerism arouses hunger for expensive goods amidst widespread poverty, it promotes corruption
 chunki abhijatavarg main vastuon kaa uparjan hi pratishtha kaa aadhaar he, chaahe in vastuon ko kaise bhi uparjit kiya jaay, bhrashtachar ko khuli chhot mil jaati he
 Low-income officials want to abuse their rights and become rich as soon as possible so that they can gain social prestige by collecting unnecessary goods
 isi kaa ek vibhats parinaam dahej ko lekar ho rahe auraton par atyaachaar bhi hai

 But as their reputation depends on their standard of living, it becomes difficult for them to disclose their greed for misappropriating their rights
 is tarah samaaj main jiske paas dhan or pad he or bhrashtachar ke avasar hai, unke or aam logon ke jivan staron ke bich khai badhati jaati he
 This also breaks the communication thread between the ruler and the ruled
 sattadhari log aam logon kii aavashyaktaaon ke prati samvedanheen ho jate hai or utpaadan kii disha adhikadhik abhijatavarg kii aavashyaktaaon se nirdhaarit hone lagati he
 Here, in the absence of items of common needs, people want to deal with the mass movement in totalitarian ways of dissatisfaction and upheaval

 The culture that had little local economic base in the villages of India has also been destroyed by this culture

 This was possible because even the rich people inside the village had very little personal requirements and they used to spend their money on such works to gain prestige

 While work in this field began about 300 years ago, this approach suggests, in order to behave rationally in an economic sense, a consumer has to be aware of all available consumption options, rating each option correctly and Able to be available for optimal selection
 During action these steps are seen to be no longer a real account for human decision making, the consumer s rarely enough information, motivation or time to make such a 'right' decision and are often working on by less rational influences such as social relationships and values vyavhaar he yah bataate hue ki darshan kaa ek parivaar hebahari ghatnaon se bataaya gaya he, or kaaryon sahit jeevon karte hai ki sabhi chijen hai, ki ,vichaaron or bhaawanaaon ke vyavhaar ke rup main mana ja saktaa he
