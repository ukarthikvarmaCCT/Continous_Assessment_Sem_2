 Indian captain Virat Kohli credited Yuvraj Singh for taking the pressure off himself in the first match of the Champions Trophy against Pakistan, saying that seeing him batting in full flow made him feel like a club batsman
 yuvaraj ne 32 gend main 53 ran banaaye jabaki kohli ne 68 gend main 81 ran kii pari kheli
 Kohli said in the press conference after the match, 'the way Yuvraj was beating the ball, i felt in front of him that i am a club batsman
 ' unhone kaha, 'main jab 50 tak pahunchaa tab tak khulkar khel nahin paa rahaa tha
 He removed all the pressure on me after Yuvi's arrival
 vah jis tarah se khel rahaa tha, is tarah se vahi khel saktaa he
 He also put fours on the yorker
 ’’ He said, 'he brought Pakistan under complete pressure and i also got a chance to freeze at the other end
 uske out hone ke baad maine morcha sambhaal liya
 His innings brought a change in the match
 ’’ Expressing disappointment over India's fielding, Kohli said, "we did well with the ball and bat but only six of our ten in fielding
 hamen sarvshereshth tiimon ke khilaaf behatar fielding kerani hogi
 'he said,' Shikhar batted well
 rohit ko kuch samay laga or vah laazmi bhi tha kyonki vah lambey samay baad antarrashtriya cricket khel rahaa tha
 The IPL is different but the international run is different and Pakistan also had a great bowling attack
 'tippaniyan Kohli said, 'hardik scored 18 runs in just five balls
 hamane pakistan se saamana hone ke kaaran chaar tej gendbaajon ko utaara
 They play spin well and are mostly right-handed batsmen
 duusari tiimon ke khilaaf ham do spinneron ko utaar sakate hai
 Asked how important it was to play against Pakistan in the wake of tensions between the two countries, Kohli said, "we have come here to play and the focus is on that
" kisi or faisle par bolnaa meraa kaam nahin he
 Top officials will speak on those decisions
 meri raay myne nahin rakhti or rakhni bhi nahin chaiye
 No matter who you are playing against, your job is to play
 ' He said, 'pakistan is a very competitive team
 maahaul jabardast tha
 As a cricketer, we thoroughly enjoyed this match
 ' kohli ne apni pari kaa bhi shrey yuvaraj ko dete hue kaha, 'yah dilachasp sthiti thi lekin main khush hum ki usne aisi pari kheli or hamen 15
 Scored 20 runs more
 iskaa puraa shrey usko jaataa he
 ' kohli ne match ke baad press conference main kaha, 'yuvaraj jis tarah se gend ko peet rahaa tha, mujhe uske saamne aisa laga ki main koi club kaa ballebaaj hum
 'he said,' i was not able to play openly till i reached 50
 yuvi ke aane ke baad usne mujh par se sara dabaav hataa diya
 He can play the same way he was playing
 usne yarker par bhi chauke lagaaye
 '' unhone kaha, 'usne pakistan ko puri tarah se dabaav main laa diya or mujhe bhi duusare chor par jamane kaa mauka mila
 After he was out, i took over
 uski pari ne match main badlaav laayaa
 '' kohli ne bharat kii fielding par niraashaa jataate hue kaha, 'hamane gend or balle se acha pradarshan kiya lekin fielding main hamaare das main se chah hi number rahe
 We have to field better against the best teams
 ' unhone kaha, 'shikhar ne acchhee ballebaaji kii
 It took Rohit some time and he was also lazy as he was playing international cricket after a long time
 ipel alag he lekin antarrashtriya ran alag he or pakistan ke paas behtareen gendbaaji akraman bhi tha
 Comments kohli ne kaha, 'hardik ne sirf paanch gend main 18 ran bana daale
 We fielded four fast bowlers as we faced Pakistan
 ve spin ko bakhubi khelte hai or adhikansh daahine haath ke ballebaaj hai
 We can field two spinners against other teams
 ' yah poochne par ki donon deshon ke bich tanaav ke maddenjar pakistan ke khilaaf khelnaa kitna ahm tha, kohli ne kaha, 'ham yahaan khilne aaye hai or usee par focus he
 It is not my business to speak on any other decision
 aalaa adhikari un faislon par bolenge
 My opinion does not matter and should not be kept
 isse fark nahin padataa ki aap kiske khilaaf khel rahe hai, aapkaa kaam khelnaa he

 Indian Air Force pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Vardhaman returned to India on Friday night
 unhen pakistan ne us vakt apane kabje main le liya tha, jab unka mig-21 ladaaku vimaan pakistani kshetra main haadase kaa shikaar ho gaya tha
 Wearing a blue coat, gray pants and white shirt, Abhinandan was received by senior officials of the Border Security Force (CRPF) at the Bagha border
 abhinandan ko shunya rekha (bharat-paak seemaa par no mens jone) par risive kiya gaya
 People gathered around the Attari border since Friday morning
 palak-paanvade bichhaakar puraa hindustan vir abhinandan ke abhinandan kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 This wait was long, too long, but the happiness that came in the part of this country at the end of that wait cannot be measured by any scale
 isse pehle pakistan kii ore se raajnneeti ke bahut daanv pench khele gaye
 All of the diplomacy was reversed, but today when Abhinandan set foot on the border of India, all the sorrows, all the wait, all the tiredness became air beating retreat or paak kii sajishhaalanki, abhinandan kii vatan vaapasi itani aasaan na rahi kyonki pakistan ne unhen bharat bhejne se pehle kai baar samay badale
 Despite this, the people waited on the streets waiting for their commander
 der isliye hui kyonki pakistan hindustaniyon ke is utsaah ko tamaashe main badalanaa chahta tha
 He wanted him to have a chance to show the world when he handed over Abhinandan to us
 wo chahta tha ki wagha-ataari seemaa par shaam ke beating retreat samaaroh ke dauraan wing commander abhinandan ko bharat ke supurd kiya jaae lekin bharat ne do took kah diya ki aisa karne kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 After all, how would India allow the return of his valor into a spectacle? bharat ne pakistan ko samajha diya ki ab uskaa koi bhi pintara kaam nahin karne vaala he
 The Foreign Ministry sent a clear message to the Pakistani government that you do as much as the Treaty of Geneva says
 na usase kam or na usase zyada
 We will see the rest
 baukhalaaye pakistan ke saamne ise sweekaar karne ke sivaa koi chaara nahin tha
 Let us tell you that even after Kargil war, Pakistan fighter pilot wanted to hand over Nachiketa to India in front of the media but refused to give it to India
 is baar bhi bharat ne use saaf samajha diya he ki jab bhi desh kii baat aegi, sena kii baat aegi, shaury kii baat aegi, bharat pakistan ke saath koi muravvat nahin baratane vaala
 pow on the one hand, Goodwill's alleged 'grand gesture' of Goodwill on the other hand raised further questions when Abhinandan was written as pow in a press release issued by the Pakistani government but it was not mentioned anywhere that he had been given under the Geneva Convention Has been omitted
 yah kitni badi vidambnaa he ki khud ko ek loktantr kah kar dhindhora peetane vaala pakistan ek ore piodblu kii baat karata he jabaki duusari ore geneva kanvension kii baat bhi nahin uthaata
 Not only this, bypassing the Geneva Convention, it tries to show in the world that the Indian commander is being left as a 'goodwill' and a peace message
 is par aage vivaad hona tay he kyonki bharat ise duniya ke saamne jarur rakhega
 a big prank of Pakistan came to light when he released a video before handing over Abhinandan to India which saw several edited cuts
 pakistan ne aisa kar phir sabit kar diya ki vah apni harkaton se baj nahin aayega
 His nefarious actions are also an important reason behind writing pok in the press release because he has been making mistakes from one to the other for the last several days
 pakistan agar press relies main piodblu likh rahaa he iskaa matlab he ki is ladaai ko vah antarrashtriya str par le janaa chaah rahaa he
 Pakistan will definitely want to mention Abhinandan with Kulbhushan Jadhav in international court, also mention it in the United Nations, in such circumstances, he will have to answer that if Abhinandan is hurt on the eye, why the video Created because videos cannot be made under the Geneva Convention
 agar kisi duusare desh ke faujee ko pakistan ne apane paas rakhaa to vah uski tasviir bhi nahin khinch saktaa lekin vahaan to video banaae gaye
 Therefore, in a press release, Abhinandan was written as pow in the press release but Pakistan may be forgetting that in such a case, it is bound to be lighter in the world

 Locals surrounded the wing commander Abhinandan where he fell
 abhinandan ke seene main himmat kaa kitna faaulad bharaa tha, ye unhone puri duniya ko dikhaa diya
 In the custody of the enemy, even after the fighter aircraft of the enemy country was dropped, there was nothing on his face called fear

 In this order, Lockheed would also like to move units in India, which produce different parts of the aircraft, which are located in different countries, in a phased manner

 In fact, 15 years later, the Kamal Nath government, which came to power, had announced that a cowshed would be built in the panchayats of the state
 goshaala na banane ke kaaran pradeshbhar kii sadakon or hive par aawaara maweshiyon ke jhund aa date hai
 The stray cattle sitting on the streets are teasing the government
 aaj tak ne bhopal kii sadakon or bhopal-raisen hive par jab reality check kiya to paaya ki chunaav ke dauraan kiye gaye vaade kaise hawa ho rahe hai
 We found that on the Ayodhya bypass of Bhopal, the herd of cows is thriving throughout the day, which causes people living in the surrounding colonies to face trouble
 vahiin bhopal kii andruni sadak se nikal kar jab aaj tak kii team hive par pahunchi to paaya ki yahaan sthiti or khatarnaak he
 Here the cow suddenly comes in front of the vehicles at high speed on the road
 jab ham yahaan tasviren le rahe the, tabhi achaanak se ek car gaay se takaraate-takaraate bachi
 Not only this, the problem in front of people passing through the highway is that even after playing the horn, these cows do not move from the front
 natijatan kai baar to vaahan chaalkon ko vaahan se utarkar khud gaayon ko hataanaa padataa he
 According to the people who pass through the streets, during these rainy days, they take their own lives on their palm
 sadakon par kharaab hai halatsadakon par to halaat kharaab hai hi, in gaayon ko pakad kar agar goshaala bhi bheja ja rahaa he to vahaan bhi sthiti kuch zyada acchhee nahin
 40 cows have died in a week at Sri Krishna Goshala in Rajgarh district of Madhya Pradesh
 is goshaala main vaise to kshamta 600 gaayon kii he, lekin yahaan hajaaron gaayon ko thuns kar rakhaa gaya he
 In this cowshed, cows surrounded by dirt and mud are dying of sesame oil
 khud sthaneey prashasan maan rahaa he ki yahaan kshamta se adhik gaayon ko rakhane kii vajah se halaat kharaab hue hai
 Explain that during the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress had given preference to Go Mata in its manifesto, following the agenda of Hindutva
 apane vachan patr main congress ne vaada kiya tha ki satta mili to gaayon ke liye hajaaron goshaala banaai jaaengi
 Despite 8 months of formation of the government, the promise of the Kamal Nath government has not been fulfilled yet
 sarkaar ne sadakon se baithi gaayon ko hataane ke liye 16 janvari ko muhim kaa pehla phase shuru kiya tha
 7 months to come, the government's campaign has died down and the public is suffering due to the herd of cows on the streets
 pradesh main kul 1296 panjikrut goshaalenaankadon par najar daalen to madhyapradesh main kul 1296 panjikrut goshaalaayein hai
 Out of these, 1 lakh 53 thousand 883 cows have been kept in 614
 inaki aamadani kaa jariya gobar or gomutra he
 Only working goshalas are eligible for grant
 6 lakh se adhik gaayen sadakon paralgbhag 6 lakh se adhik gaayen sadakon par khuli gum rahi hai, jo sarkaar or janata kii pareshaani kii mul jad hai
 Chief Minister Kamal Nath is also worried about the problem of cows roaming the streets of the state
 buudhvaar ko mukhyamantri karyaalay kii taraf se ek bayaan jari hua, jisamen siem kamalnath ne chintaa jataate hue kaha he ki hamane apane vaade ke mutabik govansh kii raksha ko lekar pehle 1000 goshaalaayein banane kaa nirnay liya or ab barish ke is mausam main govansh kii suraksha ko lekar main chintit hum
 It has been said by the CMO that for years i have seen that in this rainy season due to the water in the fields, the soil getting wet, the bovine sits on a large number of roads, due to which many Gomata are also victims of vehicle accidents
 
 kai ghayal ho jaati hai, kaiyon kii mrityu tak ho jaati he or in durghatnaon main jaan maal kii haani bhi hoti he
 CM has given a detailed action plan, on behalf of director Nath, it has been said that i have asked the officials to prepare a detailed action plan for the safety of the cow and to prevent the accidents
 jitne bhi pradesh ke pramukh maarg hai, jahaan par vaahanon kaa parichaalan tej gati se hota he, un par barish ke is mausam main suraksha kii drushti se govansh kaa sadakon par baithna roka ja sake, durghatnaon ko taala ja sake or govansh kii suraksha bhi ho sake
 He has said that even though we could not wear this action plan in this rainy season, it is our aim that we can give it a tangible form in the future
 meraa yah bhi maananaa he ki yah kaary kaaphi mushkil or chunauti bharaa he
 If we are able to implement it, it will be a big step in terms of protecting the bovine
 laavaaris hone par unhen goshaala main bhejne se lekar gaanv main hi aise pakke sthaan chinhit kiye jaaen, jahaan gomata surakshit baith saken, jisase sadak maarg par aakar vah vaahan durghatnaon kaa shikaar hone se batch saken
 The BJP had strongly sought votes in the Assembly elections in the name of the simple snipers
 aise main satta ke 8 maheene puure ho jane ke baad bhi jab gaayon kii sthiti nahin sudhari to pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kamalnath sarkaar par janata or gomata, donon ke saath chhalaava karne kaa aarope laga diya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi (narendra Modi) sat in a howitzer in Hazira, Gujarat and inspected it
 iske baad unhone ek aisa twit kiya, jisko lekar congress(congress) ne unki mouj le lee
 In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted and wrote - while checking L&T tanks in Hazira
 is par congress ne retweet karte hue kaha- priy pradhanmantri ji, yah tanks nahin he, yah hovitger he
 Hopefully you won't accidentally buy a by-plane in place of Rafael
 bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shanivaar ko surat ke hajira main larsan and toubro (el and tii) kii hovitger top nirmaan ikai kaa udghaatan kiya he
 This howitzer cannon is made by Larsen & Turbo
 bharat kii yah pehali nijee nirmaan ikai hogi jahaan swa-chaalit ke9 vajra hovitger topon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 The Congress targeted this on PM Narendra Modi's tweet
 ‘el and tii' ne 2017 main ‘mek in india' pahal ke tahat bhartiya sena ko ke9 vajra-tii 155 millimetre ‘trecked self propeld' top pranaaliyon kii 100 ikaayiyon kii aapurti karne ke liye 4,500 karod rupee kaa anubandh hasil kiya tha
 The company has set up the Armored Systems complex at its Hazira center, about 30 km from Surat, to manufacture these cannons, where self-propelled artillery howitzers, future infantry fighting vehicles, futuristic combat vehicles and futuristic Advanced armored vehicles such as the main battle tanks will be built
 vinirmaan parisar ‘ke9 vajra-tii 155 mimi / 52-calibur trecked self-propeld hovitger gan' kaarykram ko purna kar rahaa he
 The 'K9 Vajra' contract involves the supply of 100 such systems within 42 months
 yah raksha mantralay dwaara ek nijee company ko diya gaya sabase bada anubandh he

 Karan Johar's chat show 'koffee with Karan' has started
 jaisaa ki karan ne vaada kiya tha is sizan main kaaphi kuch nayaa he
 Its set is refreshing, a new and extremely fun segment and some new types of questions have been added to the rapid fire round
 or haa
 
 
 This season's coffee quiz is also very fun
 is sizan main karan ke pehle mehmaan shahrukh khan or aalia bhatta rahe
 Alia Bhatt looked much smoother and smarter than the previous season
 unhone na keval varun dhawan, siddharth malhotra or arjuna kapur ke saath kabhi bhi relationships main rahane kii baat kaa khandan kiya balki yah bhi bataaya ki 16 saal kii umr main unhone apana pehla boyfriend banaaya tha
 But the best thing that happened was that Aaliya's general knowledge (GK) has improved a lot
 sho ke coffee quiz round main aalia ne shahrukh khan ko haraa diya
 Describing Alia's victory as historic, Karan Johar said, 'it is indeed historical that a girl who was so ridiculed for not knowing the name of the President of the country, who had to be embarrassed many times, today she defeated Shah Rukh Khan This quiz is won
 haalanki yah haar shahrukh ke liye sharmindagi bharaa he
 ' sho main baar-baar 'president of india' kaa zikr kar shahrukh or karan aalia kii taang khinchate rahe, pichley sijan main aalia ne prithvi raaj chouhan ko bharat kaa raashtrapati bataaya tha, jiske baad soshal media par unka kaaphi majaak bana tha
 Taking the winning prize of the quiz, Alia said, 'pranab Mukherjee, thanks for being the best president ever
 or meri jindagi badalane ke liye bhi
 ' sho ke pehle segment main karan johar ne aalia bhatta or shahrukh khan se unke personal life ke bare main baat kii
 Talked about Shah Rukh Khan's presence in Alia's affairs and his family
 is segment main vaise to koi nai baat nikalakar saamne nahin ai lekin shahrukh khan se hamen ek nayaa shabd zarur seekhney ko mila- demotional
 Talking about the young actors of the film industry, Shah Rukh said that the youth loves their work very much but remain detached from defeat-win, success-failure, that is, do not keep them from the heart
 ve kaam karte hai, use enjoy karte hai
 i call them 'demotional'
 yani ve har chiz se ditaved rahete hai or saath hi saath apane kaam ko lekar imotional bhi hai
 The second segment of the show was of acting which was very funny
 is segment main shahrukh khan ne technical minial ko shekhspeare ke style main padhaa, vahiin aalia ne ek financial news gundon se bachakar bhaagti heroin ke rup main padhaa
 Everyone is aware of the skills of Shahrukh Khan, who has been working in the industry for the last 25 years, but Alia also did not lag behind in this segment
 tippaniyan This time a new thing has been added in Rapid Fire in which the stars who come together have to respond like each other
 haalanki, aap ek din aap falaan sitare ke rup main uthe to kya karenge? kil, mairi, hook ap or sitaron kii ranking jaise sawaal karan is sizan main bhi poochhate nazar aaenge
 And
 
 
 is sizan kaa hamper behad baari, khubasurat he, isamen kai mazedaar chizein hai
 Like all times, this time Shah Rukh Khan won Karan's Coffee Hamper, but Karan told him that if he had come in the last season, it would have been your fifth Hamper
 coffee vid karan kii shuruyaat saal 2004 main hui thi, sho ke pehle mehmaan shahrukh khan or kaajol ne kii thi
 Both have been the lead pair of Karan Johar's debut film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and 'kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' and 'my Name Is Khan'
 pichley sizan ke alaava shahrukh is sho ke har sizan kaa hissaa rahe hai
 Karan's first guests this season were Shah Rukh Khan and Alia Bhatt
 pichley sizan kii tulana main aalia bhatta kaaphi sulajhi hui or samajhadaar nazar ain
 Not only did he deny the fact that he was ever in a relationship with Varun Dhawan, Siddharth Malhotra and Arjun Kapoor, but also revealed that he made his first boyfriend at the age of 16
 lekin jo sabase acchhee baat rahi vah yah ki aalia ke saamaanya gyaan (jike) main kaaphi sudhaar hua he
 Alia defeated Shah Rukh Khan in the coffee quiz round of the show
 aalia kii is jeet ko aitihaasik bataate hue karan johar ne kaha, 'yah vaaki main aitihaasik he ki desh ke raashtrapati kaa naam nahin jaanane kii vajah se jis ladki kaa itnaa majaak udaaya gaya, jise kai baar sharminda hona padaa aaj usne shahrukh khan ko haraakar yah quij jeet liya he
 However, this defeat is embarrassing for Shahrukh
 ' Shah Rukh and Karan kept pulling Alia's legs by repeatedly mentioning 'president of India' on the show, in the last season, Alia had described Prithvi Raj Chauhan as the President of India, after which he was ridiculed on social media
 quij kaa vining prise lete hue aalia ne kaha, 'pranab mukherjee, ab tak ke sabase achche raashtrapati hone ke liye shukriya
 And to change my life too
 ' In the first segment of the show, Karan Johar talked to Alia Bhatt and Shah Rukh Khan about their personal lives
 aalia ke afares or apane parivaar ko lekar shahrukh khan ke packesiveness ko lekar baat kii
 Although nothing new came out in this segment, but we definitely got to learn a new word from Shah Rukh Khan - Demotic
 film industry ke yuva kalakaaron ke bare main baat karte hue shahrukh ne kaha ki yuva apane kaam se bahut pyaar karte hai lekin haar-jeet, safalataa-asafalataa se ditaved rahete hai yani unhen dil se lagaakar nahin rakhte
 They work, enjoy it
 main unhen 'demotional'
 That is, they remain detached from everything and at the same time are emotional about their work
 sho kaa doosraa segment acting kaa tha jo behad mazedaar rahaa
 In this segment, Shah Rukh Khan read the technical manual in the style of Shaikhspear, while Alia escaped from a financial news goon as a heroine
 industry main pichley 25 saalon ke kaam rahe shahrukh khan ke hunar se to sabhi waakif hai lekin is segment main aalia bhi peeche nahin raheen
 The comments is baar rapid fire main ek nai cheez jodi gai he jisamen saath main aae sitaron ko ek-duusare kii tarah jawaab dena hota he
 However, what would you do if you woke up as a star one day? Karan will also be asked questions such as Kill, Mary, Hook Up and Star Rankings this season
 or
 
 
 This season's Hamper is extremely heavy, beautiful, has many fun things to it
 har baar kii tarah is baar bhi shahrukh khan ne karan kaa coffee hamper jeeta, is par karan ne unhen kaha ki pichley sizan main aate to yah aapkaa paanchavaa hamper hota
 Koffee with Karan started in the year 2004, the first guests of the show were Shahrukh Khan and Kajol
 donon karan johar kii pehali film 'kuch kuch hota he' ke alaava unki filmon 'kabhi khushi kabhi gam' or 'maay nem iz khan' ke lead peyar rah chuke hai
 Apart from the previous season, Shah Rukh has been a part of every season of the show
 aalia kii is jeet ko aitihaasik bataate hue karan johar ne kaha, 'yah vaaki main aitihaasik he ki desh ke raashtrapati kaa naam nahin jaanane kii vajah se jis ladki kaa itnaa majaak udaaya gaya, jise kai baar sharminda hona padaa aaj usne shahrukh khan ko haraakar yah quij jeet liya he
 However, this defeat is embarrassing for Shahrukh
 ' Shah Rukh and Karan kept pulling Alia's legs by repeatedly mentioning 'president of India' on the show, in the last season, Alia had described Prithvi Raj Chauhan as the President of India, after which he was ridiculed on social media
 quij kaa vining prise lete hue aalia ne kaha, 'pranab mukherjee, ab tak ke sabase achche raashtrapati hone ke liye shukriya
 And to change my life too
 ' In the first segment of the show, Karan Johar talked to Alia Bhatt and Shah Rukh Khan about their personal lives
 aalia ke afares or apane parivaar ko lekar shahrukh khan ke packesiveness ko lekar baat kii
 Although nothing new came out in this segment, but we definitely got to learn a new word from Shah Rukh Khan - Demotic
 film industry ke yuva kalakaaron ke bare main baat karte hue shahrukh ne kaha ki yuva apane kaam se bahut pyaar karte hai lekin haar-jeet, safalataa-asafalataa se ditaved rahete hai yani unhen dil se lagaakar nahin rakhte
 They work, enjoy it
 main unhen 'demotional'
 That is, they remain detached from everything and at the same time are emotional about their work
 sho kaa doosraa segment acting kaa tha jo behad mazedaar rahaa
 In this segment, Shah Rukh Khan read the technical manual in the style of Shaikhspear, while Alia escaped from a financial news goon as a heroine
 industry main pichley 25 saalon ke kaam rahe shahrukh khan ke hunar se to sabhi waakif hai lekin is segment main aalia bhi peeche nahin raheen
 The comments is baar rapid fire main ek nai cheez jodi gai he jisamen saath main aae sitaron ko ek-duusare kii tarah jawaab dena hota he
 However, what would you do if you woke up as a star one day? Karan will also be asked questions such as Kill, Mary, Hook Up and Star Rankings this season
 or
 
 
 This season's Hamper is extremely heavy, beautiful, has many fun things to it
 har baar kii tarah is baar bhi shahrukh khan ne karan kaa coffee hamper jeeta, is par karan ne unhen kaha ki pichley sizan main aate to yah aapkaa paanchavaa hamper hota
 Koffee with Karan started in the year 2004, the first guests of the show were Shahrukh Khan and Kajol
 donon karan johar kii pehali film 'kuch kuch hota he' ke alaava unki filmon 'kabhi khushi kabhi gam' or 'maay nem iz khan' ke lead peyar rah chuke hai
 Apart from the previous season, Shah Rukh has been a part of every season of the show
 sho main baar-baar 'president of india' kaa zikr kar shahrukh or karan aalia kii taang khinchate rahe, pichley sijan main aalia ne prithvi raaj chouhan ko bharat kaa raashtrapati bataaya tha, jiske baad soshal media par unka kaaphi majaak bana tha
 Taking the winning prize of the quiz, Alia said, 'pranab Mukherjee, thanks for being the best president ever
 or meri jindagi badalane ke liye bhi
 ' sho ke pehle segment main karan johar ne aalia bhatta or shahrukh khan se unke personal life ke bare main baat kii
 Talked about Shah Rukh Khan's presence in Alia's affairs and his family
 is segment main vaise to koi nai baat nikalakar saamne nahin ai lekin shahrukh khan se hamen ek nayaa shabd zarur seekhney ko mila- demotional
 Talking about the young actors of the film industry, Shah Rukh said that the youth loves their work very much but remain detached from defeat-win, success-failure, that is, do not keep them from the heart
 ve kaam karte hai, use enjoy karte hai
 i call them 'demotional'
 yani ve har chiz se ditaved rahete hai or saath hi saath apane kaam ko lekar imotional bhi hai
 The second segment of the show was of acting which was very funny
 is segment main shahrukh khan ne technical minial ko shekhspeare ke style main padhaa, vahiin aalia ne ek financial news gundon se bachakar bhaagti heroin ke rup main padhaa
 Everyone is aware of the skills of Shahrukh Khan, who has been working in the industry for the last 25 years, but Alia also did not lag behind in this segment
 tippaniyan This time a new thing has been added in Rapid Fire in which the stars who come together have to respond like each other
 haalanki, aap ek din aap falaan sitare ke rup main uthe to kya karenge? kil, mairi, hook ap or sitaron kii ranking jaise sawaal karan is sizan main bhi poochhate nazar aaenge
 And
 
 
 is sizan kaa hamper behad baari, khubasurat he, isamen kai mazedaar chizein hai
 Like all times, this time Shah Rukh Khan won Karan's Coffee Hamper, but Karan told him that if he had come in the last season, it would have been your fifth Hamper
 coffee vid karan kii shuruyaat saal 2004 main hui thi, sho ke pehle mehmaan shahrukh khan or kaajol ne kii thi
 Both have been the lead pair of Karan Johar's debut film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and 'kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' and 'my Name Is Khan'
 pichley sizan ke alaava shahrukh is sho ke har sizan kaa hissaa rahe hai
