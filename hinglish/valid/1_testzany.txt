 Geology or geology is the science in which the rocks that make up the solid earth and the processes that lead to the formation of rocks, crusts and topographies are studied
 iske antargat prithvi sambandhi anekanek vishay aa jate hai jaise, khanij shaastra, talachat vigyaan, bhoomapan or khanan ejiniyari ityadi
 One of the main topics of its study is a discussion of the actions that have been taking place in the geology since time immemorial and as a result of which the form of the earth is constantly changing, although its speed is generally very slow
 anya prakarnon main prithvi kii aayu, bhugarbha, jwalamukhi kriya, bhusanchalan, bukamp or parvatanirmaan, mahadeshiy visthaapan, bhoumikeey kaal main jalwaayu parivartan tathaa him yug vishesh ullekhneey hai
 Geology discusses the origin of the Earth, its structure and its composition and its history expressed by rocks
 yah vigyaan un prakramon par bhi prakaash daalata he jinase shailon main parivartan aate rahete hai
 This includes the relationship of prehistoric organisms with innovative organisms and the study of their origin and development
 iske antargat prithvi ke sanghatak padaarthon, un par kriyasheel shaktiyon tathaa unase utpann sanrachanaon, bhupatal kii shailon ke vitaran, prithvi ke itihaas aadi ke adhyayan ko sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Geology provides insights into the history of the Earth

 Similarly, it also has importance in the assessment of aquatic resources
 prakritik vipadaaon ko samajhane evam unki bhavishyavaanee karne ke kaaran yah aam janata ke liye bhi mahatv rakhata he
 It can suggest solutions to environmental problems and gives insight into past climate changes
 bhootkneekee ejiniyari main isaki bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 There are several subdivisions of this science, of which the following are the most important - Historical Geology, Physical Geology, Economic Geology, Structural Geology, Mineralogy, Mining Geology, Geomorphology, Shell Color, Shell Science, Volcanology, Level Geology and Paleontology
 
 bhuvigyaan ko do pramukh virgon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he: Physical geology includes mineralogy, soil science, structural geology and geomorphology
 aitihaasik bhuvigyaan main starit shailavigyaan, jeevashm vigyaan tathaa purabhugol ko sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays, geology is divided into the following two branches - bhuprushthiya parivartanon ke adhyayan ko bahudhaa gatikeey bhuvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 It is clear that this name refers to the dynamic state of the dorsal environment, but nowadays the name is not anything special and physical geology is more prevalent in its place
 is vigyaan ke teen mukhya ang hote hai, jo is prakaar hai : Physics · Biology · Chemistry · Biochemistry · Mathematics · Biotechnology · Astrology · Microbiology europea sangati yaa europea vyavastha se taatpary san 1915 ke vienna congress ke baad kii vyavastha se he jo shakti-santulan kaa pratinidhitiv karti thi

 It is also called the king of raga, Swara
 is swar par sabase zyaada tehra jaataa he or baar baar prayog kiya jaataa he
 In any two ragas, even if there are similar vowels, the difference can be easily explained by the use of the vowel in them
 jaise ki raag bhoopali main or raag deshkar main ek jaise swar lagate hai- sa, re, ga, pa, dha magar raag bhoopali main ga vaadi he or raag deshkar main dha swar ko vaadi mana gaya he
 In this way the forms of both ragas change

 Mercury sulfide is an inorganic compound
 nabhikeey astr yaa parmaanu bam ek visphotak yukti he jisaki vidhvansak shakti kaa aadhaar nabhikeey abhikriya hoti he
 It can be made by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission or by the combination of both these types of nuclear reactions
 dono hi prakaar kii abhikriya ke parinamswaroop thode hi saamagree se baari maatra main urja utpann hoti he
 Today's nuclear weapon, slightly larger than one thousand kilos, can generate as much energy as it can generate from conventional explosives of several billion kilos
 nabhikeey hathiyaar mahavinashkari hathiyaar kahe jate hai
 The most powerful explosive used in World War II was the name 'blockbuster'
 iske nirmaan main tab tak gyaat prabalatam visphotak trinitrotoluin kaa 11 ton prayukt hua tha
 The first atomic bomb, which was 2000 times more powerful than this explosive, was detonated by T
N
 T
 was equivalent to an explosion of 22,000 tons
 ab to pratham parmaanu bam se bahut adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam bane hai
 The detonating substance in a nuclear bomb is uranium or plutonium
 uranium yaa plutonium ke parmaanu vikhandan se hi shakti praapt hoti he
 For this, neutrons are struck in the nucleus of the atom
 is prahaar se hi bahut badi maatra main urja praapt hoti he
 This process is called physicist nuclear fission
 parmaanu ke nabhik ke abhyantar main jo neutron hote hai unheen se neutron mukt hote hai
 These neutrons strike other atoms and cause fragmentation again
 ye phir anya parmaanuon kaa vikhandan karte hai
 This is how chain actions begin
 parmaanu bam kii aniyantrit shrunkhlaa kriyaaon ke falswaroop bheeshan prachandta ke saath parmaanu kaa visphot hota he
 Many isotopes of uranium are known
 saamaanya uranium main 99
3 pratishat you-238 or 0
7 pratishat you-235 rahete hai
 The fragmentation of U-238 is not as easy as the fragmentation of U-235
 you-235 main you-238 kii apeksha teen neutron kam rahete hai
 It is due to this lack of neutrons that fragmentation of U-235 occurs easily
 anya vikhandaneey padaarth jo parmaanu bam main kaam aate hai ve you-233 or plutonium-239 hai
 a nuclear explosion requires critical codes of fissile material
 shrunkhlaa kriya ke chaalu karne ke liye kranthik sanhati nunatam maatra he
 If the amount of fissile material is less than the critical code, then the neutron will only continue to crumble
 maatra ke dhire dhire badhaane se ek samay aisi avasthaa aegi jab kam se kam ek unmukt neutron ek nae parmaanu par prahaar kar uskaa vikhandan kar degaa
 On reaching such a state, the fragmentation process starts running automatically
 kranthik sanhati kii maatra gopneey he
 Only those nations that make nuclear bombs know and do not tell others
 yadi you-235 kii kranthik sanhati 20 pound he to das das pound do jagah lene se shrunkhlaa kriya chaalu nahin hogi
 Taking 20 pounds together will start the chain operation
 shrunkhlaakriya main neutron kii sankhya badi shighrata se badhati he
 Fission in a nuclear bomb raises the heat of uranium and other substances adjacent to it very quickly
 dhatvik uranium badi unchi daab or taap par tapadipt gas main parinat ho jaataa he
 The temperature of the explosive body is 10,00,00,000 ° C
 Wakes up to itane unche taap par uranium kii thapi hat jaati he
 Then the whole body explodes with great intensity
 parmaanu bam ke visphutit hone par aadhaat tarangen utpann hoti hai jo dhwani kii gati se bhi adhik gati se chaaron ore failati he
 When the atomic bomb is detonated above the earth, the waves hit the earth and rise up and create a new shock that spreads up and down intensely
 bam sphot kaa centre tatkaal tapt hokar nirvaat utpann karata he
 The surrounding cold air rushes to fill the vacuum
 is prakaar parmaanu bam se gharon par aghat padane se ve tut jate hai
 Explosive uranium turns into other elements, radioactive rays emanate from it and destroy living cells and destroy them
 bam kaa vinashikari kaary aghat tarangon, vedhi kirnon tathaa atyadhik ooshmaa utpaadan ke kaaran hota he
 Hydrogen bombs are a variety of nuclear bombs
 hydrogen bam yaa ech-bam adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam hota he
 It requires isotopic du terium and tritium of hydrogen
 parmaanuon ke sanlayan karne se bam kaa visphot hota he
 For this fusion, the temperature is very high, about 500,00,000 ° C
 Is required
 yah taap surya ke ooshnatam bhaag ke taap se bahut unchaa he
 Atomic bombs can achieve such high temperature
 america, england, rus, china va bharat ne hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan kiya
 North Korea is also believed to have made such a dangerous bomb
 jab parmaanu bam aavashyak taap utpann karata he tabhi hydrogen parmaanu sanlayit hote hai
 This fusion produces heat and powerful rays that turn hydrogen into helium
 1922 i
 main pehle pahal pataa laga tha ki hydrogen parmaanu ke visphot se bahut adhik urja utpann ho sakati he
 Heavy hydrogen called deuterium was invented in 1932 and heavy hydrogen called triterium in 1934
 1950 i
 main sanyukt rajya america ke raashtrapati tru main ne hydrogen bam taiyaar karne kaa aadesh diya
 For this, a large factory was established in 1951 in South Carolina
 1953 i
 main raashtrapati ijenhabar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki TNT ke lakhon ton ke baraabar hydrogen bam taiyaar ho gaya he
 In 1955 AD, the Soviet Union tested hydrogen bombs
 china or france ne bhi hydrogen bam ke visphot kiye hai
 According to the census of India, this village is located in Tehsil Chandausi, District Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh
 sambandhit janaganana code: rajya code :09 jila code :135 tehsil code : 00722 Maharani Ahilyabai was the wife of Khanderao, son of history-famous Subedar Malharrao Holkar
 janm inkaa san 1725 main hua tha or dehanth 13 agast 1795 ko; tithi us din bhadrapada krishna chaturdashi thi
 Ahilyabai was not the queen of a very heavy kingdom
 unka kaaryakshetra apekshaakrit simit tha
 Yet what he did, surprises him
 das-baarah varsh kii aayu main unka vivaah hua
 She was widowed at the age of twenty nine
 pati kaa swabhaav chanchal or ugr tha
 They tolerated all this
 phir jab bayalis-taintalis varsh kii thim, putr malerao kaa dehanth ho gaya
 When Ahilyabai was about sixty-two years old, Dauhitra Nathu passed away
 chaar varsh peeche damaad yashwantrao phanse na rahaa or inaki putree muktabai sati ho gai
 He had affection for Malharrao, the son of a distant relative Tukojirao; She used to think that in future it will handle the doors of governance, system, justice and prajaranjan; But he kept grieving them till the end
 ahilyabai ne apane rajya kii simaaon ke baahar bharat-bhar ke prasiddh tirthon or sthanon main mandir banawaye, ghat bandhwaae, kuon or baavadiyon kaa nirmaan kiya, maarg banawaye-sudharwaaye, bhukhon ke liye annsatr khole, pyaason ke liye pyau bithlaayin, mandiron main vidwaanon kii niyukti shastron ke manan-chintan or pravachan hetu kii
 And, by sacrificing the false temptation of self-respect, always tried to do justice - till death
 ye usee parampara main thim jisamen unke samakaleen puna ke nyaayadhish ramshastri the or unke peeche jhansi kii rani lakshmibai hui
 It was during her lifetime that the public began to understand and say 'devi'
 itnaa bada vyaktitv janata ne apni aankhon dekha hi kahan tha
 When there was a mess around
 shashan or vyavastha ke naam par ghor atyaachaar ho rahe the
 People - ordinary householders, peasants, laborers - were sobbing in a very inferior state
 unka ekmaatr sahaara-dharm-andhvishwaason, bhay traason or rudhiyon kii jakad main ksaa ja rahaa tha
 There was neither power nor faith in justice
 aise kaal kii un vikat paristhitiyon main ahilyabai ne jo kuch kiya-or bahut kiya
 - She is memorable
 indore main prati varsh bhadrapada krishna chaturdashi ke din ahilyotsav hota chalaa aata he
 There is a difference of opinion regarding the importance of their temple building and other religious functions
 in kaaryon main ahilyabai ne andhadhundh kharch kiya or sena nae dhang par sangathit nahin kii
 Tukoji Holkar's army had to bear the brunt of the Northern Expeditions, sometimes it is alleged that these temples have been told the outposts of Hinduism
 tukojirao holkar ke paas baarah lakh rupye the jab vah ahilyabai se rupye kii maang par maang kar rahaa tha or sansar ko dikhalaataa tha ki rupye-paise se tang hoon
 Then what was the fault of Ahilyabai? The spirit of religion has been the biggest driving force for Hindus; Ahilyabai used the same
 tatkaaleen andhvishwaason or rudhiyon kaa varnan upanyaas main aayaa he
 One of these beliefs was to jump from a hill in the Narmada arrow near Mandhata and commit suicide to attain salvation
 ahilyabai ke sambandh main do prakaar kii vichaardhaaraen rahi hai
 In one, she has been given the title of incarnation of Goddess, in the second she has shown reverence for superstitions and stereotypes along with her superlative qualities
 vah andhere main prakaash-kiran ke samaan thim, jise andheraa baar-baar grasane kii cheshtaa karata rahaa
 Due to her excellent ideas and ethical conduct, she got the status of Goddess in the society
 malharav ke bhai-bandon main tukojirao holkar ek vishwaasapaatr yuvak the
 Malharrao had also kept him with him forever and got ready for the reign
 ahilyabai ne inhen apana senapati banaaya or chouth vasuul karne kaa kaam unhen saunp diya
 Though Tukojirao Holkar was older than Ahilyabai at the age, but Tukoji considered her as his mother and used to do the work of the state with full devotion and truth
 ahilyabai kaa un par itnaa prem or vishwaas tha ki vah bhi unhen putr jaisaa maanati thim
 'khandoji Sut Tukoji Holkar' is said in the state papers wherever they are mentioned and also in the seals
 rajya kii chintaa kaa bhaar or us par praanon se bhi pyaare logon kaa viyog
 Ahilyabai's body could not handle all this grief
 or 13 agast san 1795 ko unki jivan-lila samaapt ho gai

 The study of fingerprints for the purposes of identification is called fingerprint study

 These plows look like a plowed field
 vaise to ve rekhaayen itani sookshm hoti hai ki saamanyat: inaki ore dhyaan bhi nahin jaataa, kintu inke vishesh adhyayan ne ek vigyaan ko janm diya he jise anguli-chhap-vigyaan kehete hai
 In this science, the advanced lines of the upper fingers of the fingers have special significance
 kuch saamaanya lakshanon ke aadhaar par kiye gaye vishleshan ke falswaroop, inase banane vaale aakaar chaar prakaar ke maane gaye hai: shankh, chakra, chaap tathaa mishrit 
 It is believed that finger-print science was born in Asia in very ancient times
 bhartiya saamudrik ne uparyukt shankh, chakra tathaa champon kaa vichaar bhavishya gananaa main kiya he
 More than two thousand years ago, fingerprints were used in China to identify a person
 kintu aadhunik anguli-chhap-vigyaan kaa janm ham 1823 i
 se maan sakate hai, jab brisla vishvavidhyalay ke praadhyaapak shri parkinje ne anguli rekhaon ke sthayitv ko sweekaar kiya
 The present fingerprint system was started by Sir William Harschel of the Indian Civil Service in 1858 AD in Hooghly district of Bengal
 1892 i
 main prasiddh angrej vaigyanik sar francis galton ne anguli chhaapon par apni ek pustak prakashit kii jisamen unhone hughali ke sab-register shri ramgati bandyopadhyaay dwaara di gai sahaayta ke liye kritagyata prakat kii
 He proved a system of fingerprint classification and record keeping, proving the stability of the finger lines so that the suspect could be identified properly
 kintu yah pranali kuch kathin thi
 Police Inspector General of South Province Sir E
R
 Henry improved the above system and laid down a simple system of classifying fingerprints
 iskaa vaastavik shrey shri ajijul haq, police sab-inspector, ko he, jinhen sarkaar ne 5000 kaa puraskaar bhi diya tha
 Seeing the infallibility of this system, the Government of India established the world's first finger-print-office in Calcutta in 1897 AD to identify persons previously punished by fingerprints
 anguli chhap dwaara pahchaan do siddhanton par ashrith he, ek to yah ki do vyaktiyon kii anguliyon kii chhaapen kabhi ek si nahin ho saktin or doosraa yah ki vyaktiyon kii anguli chhaapen jivan bhar hi nahin apitu jeevanoparant bhi nahin badalati
 Therefore, by comparing any considerable fingerprint with the fingerprint of a person, it can be determined whether the fingerprint to be considered is his or not
 anguli chhap ke abhaav main vyaktiyon kii pahchaan karnaa kitna kathin he, yah prasiddh bhavaal sanyasiwad ke anushilan se spasht ho jayega
 After careful inspection of the lines, the personal characteristics of them appear in the form of lines and diagonals
 anguli-chhap-vigyaan teen kaaryon ke liye vishesh upyogi he, yathah There are many criminals who do not want to give their finger prints voluntarily
 at: kaidi pahchaan adhinium dwaara bhartiya police ko bandiyon kii anguliyon kii chhap lene kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 Each state of India has a government fingerprint office in which records of the fingerprints of the punished persons are kept and necessary information is given after the expected comparison

 a central finger-print-office has also been established in Calcutta in 1956 AD
 inke atirikt anek aise visheshgy hai jo anguli chhaapon ke vivadagrast maamalon main apni sevaayen dene kaa vyavsaay karte hai
 The use of fingerprints is not limited to the police department, but in many public works it has proved useful for infallible identification

 mriganayani naamak chhbbeesvin putali ne jo katha sunai vah is prakaar he- raja vikramaditya na sirf apana rajkaaj puure manoyog se chalaate the, balki tyaag, daanveerta, dayaa, veerta ityadi anek shreshth gunon ke dhani the
 Like an ascetic, he could renounce food and water and indulge in austerity for a long time
 aisa kathor tap kar sakate the ki indrasana dol jaae
 Once in his court, a young man with a simple costume was captured and brought his soldiers
 vah raat main bahut saare dhan ke saath sandigdh avasthaa main kahin ja rahaa tha
 His costumes did not seem to be the owner of this wealth, so the soldiers thought he might be a thief and would be trying to get away with the stolen money
 raja ne jab us yuvak se uskaa parichay poocha or jaananaa chaha ki yah dhan uske paas kaise aayaa to us yuvak ne bataaya ki vah ek dhanathya stri ke yahan naukar he or sara dhan usee stri kaa diya hua he
 Now the curiosity of the king increased and they wanted to know why the woman gave him this money and where he was going with the money
 is par vah yuvak bolaa ki amuk jagah ruk kar stri ne pratiksha karne ko kaha tha
 Actually the woman has immoral relations with him and she was going to come to him after killing her husband
 donon sara dhan lekar kahin dur chale jate or aaraam se jivan vyateet karte
 Vikram immediately sent his soldiers to his address to check the truth of his words
 sipaahiyon ne aakar khabar di ki us stri ko apane naukar ke giraftaar hone kii soochna mil chuki he
 She is now mourning, saying that the robbers looted all the money and ran away killing her husband
 usne pati kii chintaa sajavai he or khud ko pativrata sabit karne ke liye sati hone kii yojana bana rahi he
 Vikram along with the soldiers along with the soldiers reached the woman's house in the morning and was really shocked to see the scene
 stri apane pati kii chita par baith chuki thi or chita ko agni lagane vaali thi
 The king stopped the one who gave fire to the pyre and asked the woman to come off the pyre
 unhone sara dhan use dikhaaya tathaa naukar ko aage laakar bole ki sari sachai kaa pataa unhen chal gaya he
 He told the woman to renounce the trinity and ordered to be ready to pay the scepter
 stri kuch kshanon ke liye to bhaybheet hui, magar duusare hi pal boli ki raja ko uske charitra par oongali uthaane ke pehle apni choti rani ke charitra kii jaanch kerani chahie
 Having said this, she jumped lightly on the pyre and became a sati by setting fire to it
 koi kuch karata vah stri jalakar raakh ho gai
 The King returned to his palace with his soldiers
 unhen us stri ke antim shabd abhi tak jala rahe the
 He started keeping an eye on the younger queen
 ek raat unhen sota samajhakar choti rani uthi or pichley daravaaje se mahal se baahar nikal gai
 The King also began to follow him discretely
 chalakar vah kuch dur par dhuni ramaae ek sadhu ke paas gai
 When the monk saw him, he got up and both of them went inside a hut nearby
 vikram ne kutiyaa main jo dekha vah unke liye asahneeya tha
 The queen began to embrace the monk nakedly and both of them became irresponsible like husband and wife
 raja ne sochaa ki choti rani ko ve itnaa pyaar karte hai phir bhi vah vishwasghaat kar rahi he
 His anger crossed the threshold and he entered the hut and killed the monk and the little queen
 jab ve mahal laute to unki maansik shanti ja chuki thi
 They began to be restless and upset all the time
 sansaarik sukhon se unka man uchaat ho gaya tathaa man main vairaygy kii bhaavana ne janm le liya
 He felt that there was a certain deficiency in his religious work due to which God punished him by showing him the scene of betrayal of the little queen
 yahi sab sochakar unhone raaj-paat kaa bhaar apane mantriyon ko saunp diya or khud samudr tat par tapasya karne ko chal pade
 Upon reaching the beach, he first called on the sea god by standing on one foot
 unki sadhana se prasann hokar jab samudr devtaa ne unhen darshan die to unhone samudr devtaa se ek choti si maang puri karne kii vinati kii
 They said that they want to do Akhanda Sadhana by making a hut on their banks and seek their blessings to complete their spiritual practice without any problems
 samudr devtaa ne unhen apana aashirwad diya tathaa unhen ek shankh pradaan kiya
 The sea god said that whenever a divine calamity comes, the sound of this conch will be overcome
 samudr dev se uphaar lekar vikram ne unhen dhanyavad diya tathaa pranaam kar samudr tat par laut aae
 He built a hut on the beach and started practicing
 unhone lambe samay tak itani kathin sadhana kii ki dev lok main hadacamp much gaya
 All the gods started talking that if Vikram is engaged in cultivation in this way, then he will take the throne of Indra
 indra ko apana singhaasana khatre main dikhaai dene laga
 He ordered his colleagues to do so much rain near the place of worship so that the entire place is submerged and the water along with Vikram Kutia gets swept away
 bas aadesh kii der thi
 a terrible rain began
 kuch hi ghanton main sachmuch sara sthaan jalmagn ho jaataa or vikram kutiyaa sahit jal main samaa gaye hote
 After all, the Sea God had blessed them
 us varsha kaa sara pani unhone pi liya tathaa sadhana sthal pehle kii bhanti sookhaa hi rahaa
 When Indra saw this amazing miracle, his worry increased
 unhone apane sevakon ko bulaakar aandhi-tufaan kaa sahaara lene kaa aadesh diya
 The storm blew with such terrible speed that the hut shattered in the twinkling
 sab kuch hawa main rui kii bhanti udne laga
 Large trees began to uproot and fall
 vikram ke paanv bhi ukhdate hue maaloom pade
 It was felt that the wind would blow them away from the place of worship
 vikram ko samudr dev dwaara diya gaya shankh yaad aayaa or unhone shankh ko jor se foonka
 a very loud sound came out of the conch
 shankh dhwani ke saath aandhi-tufaan kaa pataa nahin rahaa
 There was such peace as if there had never been a storm
 ab to indra dev kii chintaa or adhik bad gai
 He was not thinking how to break Vikram's practice
 ab vikram kii sadhana ko keval apsaraon kaa aakarshan hi bhang kar saktaa tha
 He called the nymph named Tilottama and asked him to go and break the practice of Vikram
 tilottama anupam sundari thi or uskaa rup dekhakar koi bhi kaamdev ke vaanon se ghayal hue bina nahin rah saktaa tha
 Tilottama came to the place of meditation and tried to disturb the practice of Vikram by enchanting singing and dancing
 magar vairaagi vikram kaa kya bigaad paati
 Vikram blew the conch and Tilottama felt as if someone had brought it into the flame of fire
 bhayanak taap se vah udign ho uthi tathaa vahaan se usee kshan adrishy ho gai
 When this tactic did not work, Indra's confidence was completely overwhelmed
 unhone khud brahman kaa vesh dharaa or sadhana sthal aae
 They knew that Vikram never disappoints the petitioners and donated according to his strength
 jab indra vikram ke paas ve pahunche to vikram ne unke aane kaa prayojan poocha
 He asked Vikram to give alms and asked for all the fruits of his hard work as a beggar
 vikram ne apni sadhana kaa sara fal unhen saharsha daan kar diya
 What was the spiritual fruit donation - Indra got the subsidy
 unhone prakat hokar vikram kii mahanata kaa gungan kiya or aashirwad diya
 He said that there will be no overflow and drought in the state of Vikram
 kabhi akaal yaa sookhaa nahin padegaa sari fasalein samay par or bharpoor hongi
 Indra became confused by saying so

 are covered under Horashastra
 vaise hora kaa arth he- ek ghanta
 The word Hora is formed after removing 'A' and 'tri' from the word Ahoratra
 saravali The decision of the complete happiness and sorrow of a person by the birth lag of a person in advance is usually the basic form of Hora Wound
 hora skandh ko jataka skandh bhi kaha jaataa he
 Later, it also had two parts
 jataka sambandhi vishay jisamen aayaa vah jataka kahalaaya or doosraa bhaag tajik hua
 The wing of astrology which makes the horoscopes and the person who is related to a particular person is known as Horashastra or Jataka
 varahamihir ke samay main vidwaan log hora shabd ke udgam ke vishay main anbhigya the 
 It has come to Brihajatak that Hora, by the opinion of some people, is made by removing the first and last letters of the word 'ahoratra'
 horashastra purvajanmon main kiye gaye achche yaa bure falon ko bhalee-bhanti vyakt karata he
 In Vrihajatak, Varahamihira has given special emphasis on two things- horashastra yah nahin kahata he ki vyakti kii kundalee ke grah use yah yaa vah karne ke liye baadhya karte hai, balki kundalee keval yah bataati hai ki vyakti kaa bhavishya kin dishaao kii ore unmukh he

 dhanarjan main yah bahut sahaayak he, aapattirup samudr main pot ke samaan he tathaa yatra yaa akraman main mantri ke samaan he
 As a result of all these beliefs, Indian astrology started to be considered high and it also contributed a lot in making human life virtuous

 The people of Webillon and Assyria considered their astrology to consist of three assumptions - isamen pratham dharna ko chhodkar baaki do dharanaayen bhartiya dharanaon se sarvatha bhinn hai
 The principles of karma and rebirth are not found in Vavilon and Greece

 After studying till matriculation, Sarabjit, the best player of Kabaddi, started his life by driving a tractor in the fields to help his family and he started his life happily by marrying Sukhpreet Kaur in 1984
 unase use do betiyaan punamdeep or swapandeep hui, lekin use kya pataa tha ki kismat use pakistan kii jail main le jaaegi
 August 28, 1990 was the most ill-fated day of his life
 vah sharaab ke nashe main pakistan kii seemaa main ghus gaya, kyonki tab taar ke baade nahin hote the or ek pakistani karnal ne use pakadakar saat din tak rakhaa, phir adaalat main pesh kar diya
 He was produced in the court in the name of Manjeet Singh, as an FIR was registered against him by the same name
 un par bharat ke liye jasusi karne ke aarope bhi lage
 This is where their painful story started
 punjab ke tarantaaran jile ke bhikhivind gaanv ke rahanevaale sarbajit singh kii dardanaak kahani shuru hoti he 28 agast 1990 se
 On the same day, drunk Sarabjit Singh went across the border where he was arrested by the Pakistani army
 sarbajit singh ko ro kaa agent bataate hue unhen lahore, multan or faisalabad bam dhamaakon kaa aaropee banaaya gaya
 He was later sentenced to death in October 1991
 sarbajit singh ke paksh main unke parivaar ke saath saath maanavadhikaar sanghathan bhi saamne aae tab pataa chalaa ki sarbajit ke maamle main pakistan sarkaar ne kai farjivade kiye hai
 The passport that was presented in the Pakistani court had the name written on it, but the picture of Sarabjit Singh was written
 isi tarah 2005 main pakistani ne ek video jari karke daawa kiya ki sarbajit singh ne apana jurm kabool liya he, lekin 2005 tak pakistan sarbajit singh ko manjit singh kahata tha
 It was only in 2005 that the witness came to the media who had identified Sarabjit, he clearly told the media that a statement was made against Sarabjit by putting pressure on him
 lekin in farjivade ke baavjood ek april 2008 ko sarbajit ko faansee die jane kii taarikh tay kar di gai thi, haalanki kootnithik prayaason ke baad unki faansee anischitkaal ke liye tal gai
 In June 2012, there was news in Pakistani media that Sarabjit is being released but this news proved to be a rumor
 In fact, the government of Pakistan had ordered the release of Surjit Singh in lieu of Sarabjit
 tab se bharat ke logon main yah ummid jaagi ki sarbajit singh reeha hokar ek din avashya waapas aaenge lekin aakhir main aayi unki maut kii khabar 
 The attack on 26 April in Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore proved fatal
 pakistan kii kot lakhapat jail main band bhartiya kaidi sarbajit singh ne varsh 2010 main hi apane saathi kaidiyon ke bure vyavhaar ke bare main bataaya tha
 But despite this, the jail administration did not take any step on his safety

 In the letter, he made his statement
 usne likhaa tha ki pakistan ke sarkari santhaan use sarbajit singh se manjit singh banane par tule hue the, jabaki vah khud manjit singh ke bare main nahin jaanata tha or usne pakistan main kya kiya tha, iskaa bhi ilm use nahin tha
 He wrote, "the staff and police of the jail and even the prison inmates used to look at me with glee
 ve mujhe dhamaake karne vaala maanate the
 "sarabjit thanked Pakistani lawyer Awais Sheikh for writing that he had found the real Manjit Singh
 jab sarbajit ko pakadakar manjit singh banaaya to us vakt asli manjit singh england or canada kii saiyr kar rahaa tha
 But later he was caught
 sarbajit ke parivaar ke anusaar vah seemaa par sthit apane gaanv se pakistan main bhatak jane ke baad vah galat pahchaan kaa shikaar ban gaya
 He wrote, "the prison staff and the police and even the prison inmates used to look at me with glee

 Accidentally filed in Pakistan
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki main jald hi chhot jaaoongaa
 i had not committed any crime, just crossed the border
 " Sarabjit's family says that he was an innocent farmer and he was mistakenly caught as someone else

 Lawyer Owais Sheikh claimed in court that his client Sarabjit is innocent and he is serving the sentence of Manjeet Singh
 ovais sheikh kaa kahana tha sarbajit ko 1990 main may-june main karachi bam dhamaakon kaa abhiyukt banaaya gaya he, jabaki vaastaviktaa main 27 july 1990 ko darj exiaar main manajit singh ko in dhamaakon kaa abhiyukt bataaya gaya he
 Sarabjit Singh was attacked by some prisoners in the Central Jail, Lahore at around 4
30 pm on 26 April 2013
 baad main najuk haalat main unhen jinnah hospital, lahore main bhartee karavaaya gaya, us samay ve coma main bhi chale gayi the or unki read kii haddi bhi tut chuki thi
 Nevertheless, he was kept on ventilator in the hospital
 lekin unpar kitne hamale kiye gayi the or kyon kiye gayi the is baar main pakistan sarkaar ne bataane se inkaar kar diya
 sarbajit kii bahan kaa aisa maananaa tha kii unpar jo hamalaa kiya gaya tha uski pehle se hi yojana banaai gayi thi
 His wife, sister and 2 daughters were allowed to see him in the hospital
 29 april 2013 ko bharat main pakistan ko sarbajit singh ko reeha karne kii apil bhi kii lekin bharat kii is apil ko pakistan sarkaar ne kaarij kar diya

 And his sister and his family were also sent back to India
 But after coming to India, his sister claimed that the doctors did not treat his brother honestly
 His sister says that he saw the ink mark on his brother's thumb and when he asked the doctors about this, he refused to answer it
 2 may 2013 ko, raat 12
45 baje lahore main hi unki mrityu ho gayi thi
 And they were also removed from the ventilator

 In Denmark, recent archaeological excavations at Lejre, where the Scildings' seat of Scandinavian tradition is located, that is, Heorot, reveal that the hall was built in the mid-6th century, right during the time period of Beowulf
 Three halls, about 50 meters long, were found during the excavation

 Later in his life, when Beowulf becomes king of the Gates, a dragon begins to terrorize his territory, whose treasure was stolen from his burial mound

 Beowulf decides to follow Ardragon to his den at Ahernaness, but is only dared to accompany him to the young Swedish relative Wiglaf

 Jane Chance wrote in her 1980 article "the Starkural Unity of Beowulf: The Problem of Grandmothers Mother" that the poem makes two standard interpretations: the first side suggests a two-part structure and the second side, a three-part structure Suggests that

 Beowulf begins with the story of King Harugar, who built the great hall Heorot for his people
 isamen, uski patni velhpiyo or uske yoddha naach gaakar khushiyaan manaakar samay vyateet karte hai, jab tak ki naach gane se naaraaz hokar samaaj se baahar kii prajati grandal, haul par hamalaa karti he or harugar ke kai yoddhaon ko sote samay hatya kar detii he or unka bhakshan kar leti he
 But Grendel does not dare to touch the throne of Harugar, as he is told that powerful gods are protected by Harugar
 harugar or uske log, grandal ke hamalon ke khilaaf asahaay hokar, hioroot kaa parityag karne ke bare main sochane lagate hai
 Beowulf, the young warrior of Getland, learns of Harugar's condition and, after getting permission from his king, leaves his homeland and goes to help Harugar
 biovulf or uske sainik hioroot main raat bitaate hai
 When they start sleeping, Grendel enters the hall and attacks and devours one of Beowulf's men
 biovulf, jiske paas koi hathiyaar nahin tha, jo ki nihathe jaanavar par ek anuchit laabh tha, sone kaa abhinay kar rahaa tha or grandal chalaang lagaakar use apane haath main jakad leti he
 The two start fighting
 biovulf ke anuyaayi apane talwaar lekar hamalaa karte hai, lekin unke hathiyaar grandal kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin kar pate hai
 Eventually, Beowulf breaks his hand from Grendel's body with his shoulder, and Grendel tears up and runs away to his home in a dying state
 agali raat, grandal ke maut kaa jashn manaane ke baad, harugar or uske log hiorut main sone lagate hai
 Grendel's mother appears and attacks Hall
 vah harugar ke sabase vishwaasapaarthi yoddha, ashechar, ko grandal kii maut kaa badla lete hue maar daalati he
 Hroगरgar, Beowulf and their soldiers find Grendel's mother in her lair inside the lake
 biovulf khud ko ladaai ke liye taiyaar karata he, yoddha anfarth, use talwaar haranting detaa he
 After getting Harugar to pledge for several conditions for his posthumous death, Beowulf jumps into the lake
 grandal kii maa use jald hi dekh leti he or usapar hamalaa bol detii he
 However, she is not able to harm Beowulf through her weapon, dragging him to the bottom of the lake
 gupha main grandal kaa sharir or do aadamiyon kii laashen rakhi hui hai, grandal kii maa or biovulf ke bich bheeshan ladaai chal rahi hai
 At first, Grendel's mother seems to prevail
 biovulf, apane haranting se apane dushman ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa paa rahaa haikar saktaa apane dushman main, yah use krodhit karata he
 Beowulf again escapes his enemy's attack due to his armor, or is and hurts Grendel's mother's hands with his sword, Beowulf beheads him
 khoh main aage jane par, biovulf ko grandal kii laash milti he, vah uskaa sir kaat kar apane paas rakh letaa he
 Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his comrades after "nine hours"
 vah hioroot jaataa he, jahaan harugar biovulf ko apane parivaar kii viraasat nagling talwaar sahit kai uphaar detaa he
 Beowulf returns home and later becomes king of his own people
 ek din, biovulf ke jivan main kuch samay pashchaat, ek gulam airnanes main agyaat dregon ke maand se ek swarna cap churaataa he
 When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, he angrily comes out of his cave and burns everything out of his sight
 biovulf or uske yoddha dregon se ladane jate hai, lekin jab biovulf dregon ke waar se ghayal ho jaataa he, to uske sabhi yoddha dar kar bhaag khadey hote hai
 Only one warrior, a brave young wiggle, stops to help Beowulf
 donon milakar dregon ko maar giraate hai, lekin biovulf kii uske ghaavon ke kaaran maut ho jaati he
 After the cremation, Beowulf is buried in a rock near the sea, where seafarers can see his tumulus

 There is a curse associated with that pile

 These funerals help to change the outline of the poem's story as well as to change the audience's views on worldly possessions, war and fame
 shavyatraaon ko upar varnit teen yudhon ke saath jodakar bhi dekha jaataa he
 The three funerals share the same proposal of change in theme through the description of each funeral
 gail oven-croker ne apni pustak da for funerals in biovulf main tark diya he ki kavita ke le of last cerviver" ke rup main jaani jaati he, jo ki ek atirikt antim sanskaar he
 The funeral processions include the ritual of self-accumulation: evidence of sacrificial objects with both religious and socio-economic functions
 kavita main pehali shavyatra ko dens kaa raja scield sefing kaha gaya he 
 The first part helps the poet explain the settings of the poem by introducing Hrothgar's lineage
 shavyatra nayak biovulf or pehle daanav grandal ke saath ke takaraav kaa parichay he
 The excerpt begins with a description of Scheild's glory as "the curse of many tribes, the destroyer of the liquor table
" scield kii mahima or mahatv ko uski pratishthit maut dwaara darshaya gaya he, jo use dence ke raja ke rup main seva karte hue praapt hui thi
 His importance once again proves his grand funeral procession carried out by the people: the many weapons and treasures displayed at his funeral are proof of his being a great warrior and great leader
 kavi ne scield ke madhyam se nayakik samaaj ko prastut kiya he
 The importance of such items is described by burying them with the king's property
 in sansaarik sampattiyon ke mahatv kaa upyog baad main khajaane ke sambandh main is mrit raja kii mahanata sthapit karne main kii gai he
 Scheild's funeral helps the poet to explain how heroism and worldly possessions define the importance of an individual in the war of judicial society
 yah antim sanskaar kavi kii madad pratipakshi, biovulf or mukhya daanav grandal ke bich kii sajeesh ke patal ko viksit karne main karata he
 The second rite in the poem is that of the family Hildeburg and the poem is on the second number of FITT
 antim sanskaar ko hioroot main grandal par biovulf kii jeet kaa jashn manaane ke liye gaaya jaataa he
 It also marks the hero's victory in the battle against Grendel's mother
 yuddh main hildebrg ke bhai, bete or pati kii maut ho gai thi
 Scheild was also killed in the fight and is also the saga of the extraordinary wealth used in the funeral of the dead
 den ke raja kii tarah, hildebrg ke rishtedaaron ko bhi unke hathiyaar or swarna ke saath unki mahatvata ko darshane ke liye dafnaaya gaya tha
 However, the funeral procession of relatives was not as grand, it was only a funeral ceremony
 iske alaava, kavi ne yuddh main marane waalon kii bhaawanaaon ko bhi chitrit kiya he
 Horrific details such as "melting heads, open mortal wounds 


 and blood coming out of the body" describe the war as a painful and horrific accident rather than a heroic tale
 haalanki kavi ne maut se zyada sampatti ke vishay ko mahatvata dene kii puri koshish kii he, phir bhi yuddh kii mahima ko shaatir yuddh kii pravriti chunauti detii he
 The second funeral procession displays a different concept than the first and changes in the direction of the story lead to Beowulf's fight against Grendel's mother
 "le of da last cerviver" taarkik rup se anya dafnaae gaye logon ke mahatv ko nirdhaarit samaantaaon ke kaaran biovulf ke teen anya shavyatraaon ke atirikt he
 The similarities that identify this passage with the three other funerals are similar to burial rituals, changes in setting and role, and changes in theme
 shok ek shavyatra jaisaa prathit hota he kyonki dafan prastaavon main antim uttarajive ke varnan hai, jo ki scield sefing, hildebrg ke parijan or biovulf kii shavyatraaon main bhi milte hai
 The Last Survivor tells of the many treasures left by the dead, such as weapons, weapons, and gold cups, whose "best shining cups 


, blood-soaked weapons and armor" of Scheldt, "blood-soaked armor of the family of Hildeburg
 And there are considerable similarities with the discovery of pig-shaped helmets "and Beowulf's dragons
 is ansh ko shavyatra ke rup ambling hoque swift horse" bhi he
 It is an animal offering that was a ritual to be buried during the era of poetry
 iske alaava, yah ansh, anya shavyatraaon kii tarah, setting or bhoomika ke parivartanon ko nirdisht karata he
 People also say that the third part of the poem describes the time spent during the last battle between Beowulf and the dragon
 kavi ne yuddh main hui mauton ko bhayaavah bataaya he, jo ki antim uttarajive kii aankhon ke madhyam se kavita ke duusare bhaag kii avadharana ko aage badhaata he
 The fourth funeral procession mentioned in the poem is the original funeral of Beowulf
 dregon ke khilaaf antim yuddh ke baad, biovulf ko ghaatak ghaav lagate hai or uskaa dehanth ho jaataa he
 The greatness of Beowulf's life is described in his funeral, especially through the many tributes of his people
 In addition, the vast treasure of dragons was buried with the hero
 kavi ne bhi biovulf ke antim sanskaar ke varnan ko anya kii apeksha adhik mahatv diya he
 For the funeral of their leader, "viohsten's son announces to many people that he should stay away from the pyre
" The remains of the dragons are thrown into the sea parallel to Scyld's tomb
 biovulf kii shavyatra kavita kaa chauthaa bhaag he, jo us nayak ko shradhanjali he, jo "shaleen or nishpaksh, logon ke dayaalu or jeetne ke liye samvedansheel" tha
 The first known owner of the Beowulf manuscript is the 16th-century scholar Lawrence Nowell, after whom the manuscript is named, although its official designation is Cotton Vitellius A

 In a letter to Wanley, Hiches made a clear allegation against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith Cotton MS

 Beowulf has failed to mention the script when making xv's catalog

 The original Beowulf manuscript was transcribed by two clerks: cleric a and cleric B, whose letter is placed in line 1939
 donon lipikon kii likhaawat kaa bilkul bhi nahin milte hai
 Clerk B's script is archaic
 donon lipikon ne apane kaam ko sahi kiya he or lipic bi ne lipic e ke kaam kii bhi sahi kiya he
 The work of Clerk b has a similarity to the work of the first clerical of the Blickering Homilies, and even to the extent that they are written with the same script
 pratilekhan malmesbari abi ke librari main rakhe or strot kaaryon ke rup main uplabdh gyaan kii pustakon se or paath main paae jane vaali sthaneey boli ke kuch vishisht shabdon se likhi gai prathit hoti he
 However, for at least a century, some scholars maintain that Grendel's character in Beowulf was derived from St
 Paul's view of hell in Homily 16 of the Blickering Homilies
 iceland ke vidwaan grimer johnson throkaleen ne dainish sarkaar ke aitihaasik anusandhan ayog ke antargat kaam karte hue, pandulipi kaa pehla pratilekhan 1786 main kiya or 1815 main use prakashit kiya
 He transcribed one himself and got the other transcriptionists who did not know anglo-saxon
 Since that time, the manuscript has been twisted several times, yet Throcklein's transcription remains a valuable secondary source for Beowulf scholars

 yah aitihaasik pariprekshya kii ek mahakavy kavita he; mahakavy ghatnaon or mahanatam ateet ke veeron kii ek kahani he
 Although its author is unknown, its themes and subject matter resemble European heroic poems rooted in the original anglo-saxon tradition and plowed by scoops

 Felt that the manuscripts present the transcription of the exhibit, although may have taken more than one meeting
 keayrnan peliographical or kodicological saakshyon ke aadhaar par tark diya he ki kavita pandulipi ke saath samakaleen he
 Kiernan's argument corresponds to part of the political context of the much-talked-about poem: Most scholars have also recently stated that the poem was written in the 8th century, and they inferred it on the basis that the poem's extreme sympathy for Danes Is shown and there is no possibility of it being written by anglo-saxon during the Viking era in the 9th and 10th centuries
 keayrnan ke tark 8veen sadi ke udgam ke khilaaf hai, kyonki iske liye bhi yah jaruri he ki kavita kii anglo-sexon dwaar viking yug main pratilekhan kii gai ho, peliographical or kodicological sakshya is vishwaas ko badhaava dete hai ki biovulf 11veen sadi ke samgr kii kavita he or yah kahatha he ki e or lipic bi lekhak the or lipic bi donon main se adhik maarmik tha

 Tolkien is of the opinion that the poem, written a few generations after the completion of Christianity in England around 700 AD, contains a genuine memory of anglo-saxon paganism
 tolkin kaa drudh vishwaas ki kavita 8veen sadi main likhi gai thi, ko tom shippi kaa samarthan praapt he
 The suggestion by John Mitchell Kimbley and the defense of jatching brings at least one early 9th-century Finnsburg episode to a terminus post quem
 kimbali ne aitihaasik almainic nobalman hoching ke putr hnobi ke saath hoque ke putr hnaf ke kirdaar kii pahchaan kii or 800 i
 ke shuruyaat main frisia par aadhaarit purv ank par kaam kiya
 The date of the 11th century is due to scholars who argue that, rather than the transcription of the story from oral tradition by a literate monk, Beowulf reflects the original interpretation of the story by the poet
 biovulf uski vartmaan pandulipi se pehle kabhi kisi maukhik parampara main lipt rahaa he yaa nahin, yah prashn sadiyon se bahes kaa vishay he or isamen iskaa nirmaan kaise hua, iske alaava bhi kai or prashn shaamil hai
 Rather, it refers to the principle of oral-formulaic structure and oral tradition, the question of how to understand the poem and what type of interpretation is needed
 maukhik parampara ke sandarbh main biovulf par vidwaanon kii charchaa 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main atyant sakriy thi
 The debate can be seen as: On the one hand, we can infer the poem by bringing together several stories related to the protagonist
 in tukdon ko parampara ke kaaran kai varshon tak rakhaa jayega or aane vaali peedi ke kaviyon kii iske dwaara shikshuta pradaan kii jaaegi
 kavita ko maukhik rup se bina kisi taiyaari ke likhaa gaya he or yah ek parmparik puralekhan he, jo maukhik, butaparast, german, vir or adivasee sabhi ko aakarshith karata he
 On the other hand, some people believe that the poem was written by a literate clerk who was literate while learning Latin, possibly a monk or a Christian with a deep outlook
 is paksh par, butaparast ke sandarbh sajaavati puralekhan kii koi vidhi hogi
 According to the third view both the above mentioned debates are correct and this is an attempt to add them, so they cannot be expressed as conflicting; Accordingly, the work of poetry contains a glimpse of more than one Christian and more than one pagan spirit, which has been separated from each other for several hundred years; It says that the poem was originally written by a literate Christian writer who had knowledge of paganism and may have had ancestors and pagan converts, a poet who was proficient in both oral and literate clerks
 And who was able to "reconstruct" the poetry of oral tradition; This early Christian poet saw his desire to sacrifice for justice and his efforts to help and protect the needy, and the greatest security; Good pagan people were seen choosing the right path and so this poet presented the pagan culture with patience and respect; Yet the creation of this early Christian poet and much later composer is "fire-and-brimstone", a Christian poet who calls the pagan practice dark and sinful and which added to the demonic aspects of its demons

 For example, the scholar states that poetry was delivered from the reader to the reader by the principle of oral-formulaic composition, which suggests that epic poems are improved from time to time by the reader

 yah sampurna vishleshan yah sabit karne ke liye paryaapt he ki biovulf kii rachana maukhik thi
 Beowulf and other anglo-saxon poems have mixed results from tests conducted for oral-formulated composition
 jabaki "vishay" anglo-sexon or anya europea kaaryon main maujuud hai, kuch vidwaan, tark dete hai ki kavitaayen shabd-dar-shabd ke aadhaar or kai sutron or paddatiyon kaa anusaran karke rachi jaati hai
 Larry Benson has argued that interpreting Beowulf as a purely formative work undermines the reader's ability to analyze that the poem is written in unified form and that they cannot concentrate on the poet's creativity 
 iske bajaay, unhone prastaavit kiya ki german sahitya ke anya anshon main "parampara ke tatv" hai jinase biovulf uddhrut or vistaarit hua he
 a few years later, Ann Watts published a book, in which she described the traditional, Homer, oral-formulaic theory for anglo-saxon poetry as incomplete
 unhone yah bhi tark diya he ki do paramparaon kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati or isliye aisa nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Thomas Gardner agreed with Watts, arguing in a newspaper published four years ago that the Beowulf text is of diverse nature and is constructed entirely by formulas and themes
 jon miles fole ne biovulf bahes ke sandarbh main vishesh rup se kaha he ki, jabaki tulanaatmak kaary aavashyak or maanya donon he, lekin iskaa aayojan di gai paramparaon kii vishistataaon ke saath dekhnaa chahie; fole ne maukhik paaramparik siddhant ke vikaas ko dekhte hue tark diya ki rachana ke bare main asatyaapit anumaan kaa anumaan na lagaaein or na hi isapar nirbhar hon or paramparikta or paathyata ke avichhinnak ke paksh main kii gai rachana par maukhik / likhit manyataon par dhyaan kendrit na karen
 Finally, in Ursula Scheffer's view, the question becomes somewhat like a red herring if the poem was "oral" or "written"
 is model main, kavita kii rachana kii gai he or vah donon maansik kshitij ke bheetar vyakhya ke yogya he
 Scheffer's "oral" concept proposes neither an agreement nor a coincidence of ideas that treat the poem as European, pagan and oral on the one hand and quoted from Latin on the other, as Christian or literate, but as Monica Otter states: "


 'a coin of rupees', is found in both oral and literate cultures and both have their own logic and beauty
" " Old English topics The poem has a mix of Old English Western Saxon and Anglian dialects, although they are more of a dialect of Western Saxon, as many other Old English poems were copied at the same time
 biovulf pandulipi main bhashaai rup main ek vismayakari sarani he
 This is the fact that has led some scholars to believe that Beowulf's long and complex transmission has been carried out through all the main dialect areas
 kavita main nimnlikhit boliyon kaa jatil mishran he: marsian, northmbarian, aarambhik pashchimi sexon, cantish or antim pashchimi sexon

 Kiernan's argument against the initial date based on a mixture of forms is long and concise, but he concludes that a mixture of forms may have indicated a relatively straightforward history of the written text as follows: 


 ek 11veen sadi kaa emes, ek 11veen sadi kaa marsian kavi ne puraatan kavy boli kaa upyog karte hue; or 11veen sadi kii maanak saahitiyik boli jo ki aarambhik yaa ant kaa ho saktaa he, dwandvatmak-boli ke roopon or vibhinn vartanee kaa prayog; or do 11veen sadi ke lipikon thoa bhinn vartanee tareekon se likhaa ho
 According to this view, Beowulf can be seen as a product of large-scale archaeological interests and it gives readers a sense of the 11th-century anglo-saxon sentiments about Denmark and its pre-history, then the Age of Bade and the 7th or Tells more about the 8th-century anglo-saxon expressions of their ancestral homeland
 biovulf jaisi ek puraani angrezi kavita aadhunik kavita se bahut alag hoti he
 anglo-saxon poets used specific alliteration verses, a form of verses in which alliteration is used as the main structural tool for integrating lines of poetry, in place of other instruments such as rhyme
 It is a technique in which the first part of the line is connected to the second part through the same initial sound
 iske atirikt, do bhaagon ko ek yeti main vibhajit kar diya jaataa he: " oft scield sefing \ \ skipina pritom" or sanyuktakshar "cg" kaa uccharan "dj" kii tarah kiya jaataa he, jaise ki shabd "edge" main
 f or s donon ke uccharan unke dhvanyatmak vaataavaran par nirbhar karte hue bhinn hote hai
 Between vowels or consonants, there are sounds that sound like modern v and z
 anyathaa ve chup rahati hai, jaise aadhunik "fat" main f or "sat" main s
 kuch akshar jo ab aadhunik angrezi main nahin milte hai, jaise thorn, þ or eth, ð - aadhunik angrezi "th" ke donon uccharan "cloth" or "clothe" main kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai- kaa upyog mul pandulipi or aadhunik angrezi ke sanskarnon main vyapak rup se kiya gaya he
 The sound of these characters resonates like f and s
 donon swar hai or anya swar dhvaniyon ke bich main hai: oðer, laþleas, suþern
 anyathaa ve aghosh hoti hai : þunor, suð, soþfæst
 Canning is also an important technique in Beowulf
 ve rosemara ke chizon ke udbodhak kaavyatmak varnan hai, aksar pad main anupras kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye banaaya jaataa he
 For example, a poet might call the sea "swan-road" or "whale-road"; a king can be called a "ring-giver"
 biovulf main kai caning hai or upkaran puraani angrezi kii theth clasik kavita hoti he, jisamen bahut saare sutara hote hai
