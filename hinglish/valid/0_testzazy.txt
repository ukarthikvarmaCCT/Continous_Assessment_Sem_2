 suprasiddh sahitya darpan main kaha gaya he hriday kaa sthaayee bhav, jab vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav kaa sanyog praapt kar letaa he to ras rup main nishpann ho jaataa he
 Dev, the chief poet of Reetikal, has defined rasa in these words: is prakaar ras ke chaar ang hai - sthaayee bhav, vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav
 Bhava means: -hona sahruday ke ant:karan main jo manovikar vaasana yaa sanskaar rup main sadaa vidyaman rahete hai tathaa jinhen koi bhi virdohi yaa avirohi dabaa nahin saktaa, unhen sthaayee bhav kehete hai
 They reside in the human mind in seed form, stagnant for a long time
 ye sanskaar yaa bhaavana ke dyotak hai
 They are hidden in humans in the same way as the smell in the soil is absorbed in a different way
 ye itane samarth hote hai ki anya bhaavon ko apane main villin kar lete hai
 Their number is 11 - Rati, Haas, mourning, ecstasy, anger, fear, jugupsa, amazement, Nirveda, Vatsalata and love for God
 vibhaav kaa arth he kaaran
 They affect / express the permanent expressions, making them tasty
 ye ras kii utpatti main aadharbhoot maane jate hai
 There are two differences of influence: bhaavon kaa udgam jis mukhya bhav yaa vastu ke kaaran ho vah kavy kaa alamban kaha jaataa he
 Subjects and shelter come under suspension
 jis paatr ke prati kisi paatr ke bhav jaagrit hote hai vah vishay he
 In literature, this topic is called Alamban Vibhava or 'alamban'
 jis paatr main bhav jaagrit hote hai vah aashray kehalaata he
 The causal factor in keeping the permanent feeling awake is called stimulation effect
 udhaaharan swaroop vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah ke liye saamne khadaa hua shatru alamban vibhaav he
 The army with the enemy, the instruments of war and the enemy's robes, roar-lines, arms operations, etc
 are the stimulus effects
 uddipan vibhaav ke do prakaar maane gayi hai: Meaning the powers and gestures of standing arthath vaataavaran se sambandhit vasteen
 Natural scenes are also counted under these
 rati, haas, shok aadi sthaayee bhaavon ko prakashit yaa vyakt karne vaali aashray kii cheshtaaen anubhav kehalaati hai
 These gestures originate in the shelter after emotional awakening, hence they are called Anubhav, that is, one who follows the emotion is called Anubhav
 anubhav ke do bhed hai - icchit or anichhit
 The actions which occur in the ordinary folk publishing the emotions, generated by their own causes through dedication and stimulation, are called poetic dramas etc
 udhaaharan swaroop virah-vyakul nayak dwaara sisakiyaan bharna, milan ke bhaavon main ashru, swead, romaanch, anuraag sahit dekhnaa, krodh jaagrit hone par shastr sanchaalan, kathor vaani, ankhon kaa laal ho janaa aadi anubhav kahe jaaenge
 Simple experience: There are four distinctions
 1
angik 2
vaachik 3
 aharya 4
 satvik
 The physiological efforts of the asylum are asexual or somatic
 rati bhav ke jaagrath hone par bhu-vikshep, kataaksh aadi praytn purvak kiye gayi vagvyapaar vaachik anubhav hai
 Superimposed or artificial dress design is dietary experience
 parantu, sthaayee bhav ke jaagrath hone par swaabhaavik, akrutrim, aytnaj, angavikar ko satvik anubhav kehete hai
 For this, the shelter does not have to make any external efforts
 isliye ye aytnaj kahe jate hai
 They are self-generating and cannot be stopped
 satvik anubhav : arthath aath bhed hai - stambh, swead, romaanch, swarbhang, vepathu, vaivarny, ashru or pralay
 Those expressions which come in a helpful form only to confirm the permanent feeling for a short time and immediately disappear, are communicable
 sanchari shabd kaa arth he, saath-saath chalanaa arthath sancharanshil hona, sanchari bhav sthaayee bhav ke saath sancharit hote hai, inamen itnaa sarmathy hota he ki ye prayek sthaayee bhav ke saath uske anukool banakar chal sakate hai
 Therefore they are also called adulterous expressions
 sanchari yaa vyabhichaari bhaavon kii sankhya 33 maani gayi he - nirved, glani, shankaa, asuya, mad, shram, aalasy, deenta, chintaa, moh, smriti, dhruthi, vrida, chapalya, harsh, aaveg, jadta, garv, vishaad, autsukya, nidra, apsmaar, swapn, prabodh, amarsh, avhittha, ugrata, mati, vyaadhi, unmaad, maran, traas or vitark
 Bharatamuni, while revealing rasa as an essential element of poetry, has clearly mentioned its eight distinctions under the names Shringar, Humor, Raudra, Karun, Veer, Kavach, Bibhatsa and Bhavya and based on certain lines, scholars imagine that He has also approved the ninth juice called Shanta
 inhen nau rason kii sangya he navras
 These juices result from the coincidence of vibrancy-communicable
 prayek ras kaa sthayibhav alag-alag nishchit he
 The Nirvighna-prati-adhyabha stage which is fulfilled by its Vibhavadi coincidence is called Rasa
 shringaar kaa sthaayee rati, hasya kaa haas, raudra kaa krodh, karun kaa shok, vir kaa utsaah, adbhut kaa vismay, bibhats kaa jugupsa, bhayanak kaa bhay tathaa shant kaa sthaayee sham yaa nirved kehalaata he
 Bharata has considered Vishnu, Pramatha, Rudra, Yamraj, Indra, Brahma, Mahakal and Kaldev, the deities of the eight Rasas respectively
 shant ras ke devtaa narayan or uskaa varna kundetu bataaya jaataa he
 The first eight rasas are considered as Shyam, Sit, Rakht, Kapot, Gaur, Peet, Neel and Krishna Varna respectively
 bharat ne pratham aath rason main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats ko pradhan maanakar kramash: hasya, karun, adbhut tathaa bhayanak ras kii utpatti maani he
 The humor of Shringar arises as a result of humor, raudra and heroic deeds resulting from compassion and the amazing and gruesome philosophy
 anukriti kaa arth, abhinavgupt ke shabdon main abhas he, at: kisi bhi ras kaa abhas hasya kaa utpaadak ho saktaa he
 Deformed prostitutes are also funny
 raudra kaa kaary vinaash hota he, at: usase karun kii tathaa virkarm kaa karta praaia: ashakya kaaryon ko bhi karte dekha jaataa he, at: usase adbhut kii utpatti swaabhaavik lagati he
 Similarly, the origin of the terrible is also possible from Bibhatsadarshan
 akele smashanadi kaa darshan bhayotpadak hota he
 However, this genesis theory cannot be said to be absolute, because the raksha or heroic rasa of the altar can also create the terrible for the spontaneous, and the origin of calm is also possible from the horrors
 raudra se bhayanak, shringaar se adbhut or vir tathaa bhayanak se karun kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 In fact the opinion of Bharata is not clear
 unke pashchaat dhananjay ne chitt kii vikaas, vistaar, vikshobh tathaa vikshep naamak chaar avasthaaen maanakar shringaar tathaa hasya ko vikaas, vir tathaa adbhut ko vistaar, bibhats tathaa bhayanak ko vikshobh or raudra tathaa karun ko vikshepavastha se sambandhit mana he
 But the scholars who believe only three states, called Druti, Vistara and Vikas, will not be solved by this classification
 isi prakaar yadi shringaar main chitt kii dravit sthiti, hasya tathaa adbhut main uskaa vistaar, vir tathaa raudra main uski dipti tathaa bibhats or bhayanak main uskaa sankoch maan len to bhi bharat kaa kram thik nahin baithta
 The presence of one situation with another is also not impossible
 adbhut or vir main vistaar ke saath dipti tathaa karun main druti or sankoch donon hai
 Nevertheless, there is so much indication from the establishment of a Bharathakrita relation that there is mutual reciprocity in the said rasas and they are friends and associates of each other
 mitrataa ke samaan hi in rason kii prayogsthiti ke anusaar inke virodh kii kalpana bhi kii gai he
 Which other juices, along with which other juices will be immediately hindered in taste, this opposition is based on this idea
 karun, bibhats, raudra, vir or bhayanak se shringaar kaa; bhayanak or karun se hasya kaa; hasya or shringaar se karun kaa; hasya, shringaar or bhayanak se raudra kaa; shringaar, vir, raudra, hasya or shaat se bhayanak kaa; bhayanak or shant se vir kaa; vir, shringaar, raudra, hasya or bhayanak se shant kaa virodh mana jaataa he
 This protest is present due to shelter, communion, communion or continuity
 prabandh kavy main hi is virodh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In Muktak, there is no fear of ending with the verses of the subject
 lekhak ko virdohi rason kaa aashray tathaa alambanon ko pruthak-pruthak rakhkar athwa do virdohi rason ke bich donon ke mitra ras ko upasthit karke yaa pradhan ras kii apeksha angaras kaa sancharivat upasthit karke is virodh se utpann aswaad-vyaghaat ko upasthit hone se bachaa lenaa chahie
 Considering the deliciousness of the juice, it is said to be Brahmananda sibling, Swaprakasananda, eccentric etc
 and on this basis all the juices are considered to be enjoyable
 bhattnayak ne satvodrake ke kaaran mamatv-paratv-hin dasha, abhinavgupt ne nirvighn pratiti tathaa aanandavardhan ne karun main maadhurya tathaa ardrata kii avasthit bataate hue shringaar, vipralambh tathaa karun ko uttarottar prakarshamay bataakar sabhi rason kii anandswarupata kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 But by considering the sentiments based on favorable sentimentality and unfavorable sentimentality, Rudrabhatta Ramchandra Gunachandra, Haripal, and Dhananjaya and Acharya Ramchandra Shukla in Hindi have considered the juxtaposition of the rashas and the sadistic sensations
 abhinavgupt ne in sabase pehle hi "abhinavbharti" main "sukhdu:khaswabhaavon ras:" siddhanth ko prastut kar diya tha
 In the rhetorical rasas, sringar, valor, humor, wonderful and quiet, and in sadistic karuna, raudra, bebhatas and terrible were counted
 "pankaras" kaa udhaaharan dekar jaise yah siddh kiya gaya ki gud mirich aadi ko mishrit karke banaae janevaale panak ras main alag-alag vastuon kaa khatta meethaapan na maaloom hokar ek vicitra prakaar kaa aswaad miltaa he, usee prakaar yah bhi kaha gaya ki us vaichitrya main bhi anupatik dhang se kabhi khatta, kabhi tikt or isi prakaar anya prakaar kaa swaad aa hi jaataa he
 Madhusudan Saraswati's statement is that even after considering sattva as prime, rather than raja or tam, it should be accepted that partly they also remain tasteful
 acharya shukla kaa mat he ki hamen anubhuti to varnit bhav kii hi hoti he or bhav sukhaatmak du:khaatmak aadi prakaar ke hai, atev ras bhi donon prakaar kaa hoga
 On the other hand, to treat the juices as blissful, consider it to be a pity for the biased gentlemen and take the support of the argument that even if the sorrowful object is dear, it seems to be pleasurable
 jaise, ratikeli ke samay stri kaa nakhkshatadi se yon to sharir pidaa hi anubhav hoti he, kintu us samay vah use sukh hi maanati he
 In addition to this notion of Bhoja and Vishwanath, Madhusudan Saraswati himself supports his blissfulness by considering the rasas as distinct and unique from the sensation of cosmic emotions, and Abhinavagupta explains this notion that we experience the same feeling without being distracted and If it is done without external or intrinsic interference, then it is called joyful because it is tolerable
 yadi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi kyon na mana jaae? is prakaar ke anek tark dekar rason kii aanandarupata siddh kii jaati he
 The pleasure of trajedi in English has also been resolved in many ways and Marathi writers have also presented quite different perceptions regarding the beauty of juices
 praaia: rason ke vibhinn naamon kii oupaadhik yaa aupchaarik satta maanakar parmaarthik rup main ras ko ek hi maanane kii dharna prachlit rahi he
 Bharata has used the word "rasa" in a line in the line "na Hhi Rasadruta Kashchidapyartha: Pravartat" and Abhinavagupta has expressed the above notion
 bhoj ne shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar uski sarvathaev bhinn vyakhya kii he, vishwanath kii anusaar narayan pandit chamatkaarakari adbhut ko hi ekmaatr ras maanate hai, kyonki chamatkaar hi rasaroop hota he
 Bhavabhuti considers Karun to be the only rasa and explains the origin of all from him, and on the basis of the statement of "swayam swayam nimittamasadya shantadbhava: enlightenment, re-creation of peace," - calm can be considered as the only juice
 isi prakaar utsaah tathaa vismay kii sarvarasasanchari sthiti ke aadhaar par unhen bhi anya sab rason ke mul main mana ja saktaa he
 Rasa is just a monolithic feeling in the form of taste and pleasure, it is one side and other juices have emerged from the same rasa, it is the other side
 rasapraadhanya ke vichaar main rasarajata kii samasya utpann kii he
 Bharata considers all Shuchi, Ujwal, Medhya and Dalani as adorners, "agnipuran" considers the dressing as the only rasa and distinguishes it from others, Bhoja considers the Shringar as the original and only rasa, but on the basis of the available written evidence " The use of the word "rasaraja" appears only for Bhaktiras in "ujjwalanilamani"
 hindi main keshavadas shringaar ko rasanayak or dev kavi sab rason kaa mul maanate hai
 The use of the noun "rasaraja" is used only by Matiram
 duusari ore banarsidas "samaysar" naatak main "navamon saant rasni ko nayak" kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Acceptance of rajrajata is dependent on comprehensiveness, fervent taste, ability to penetrate other juices, the power to embody all sancharis and satvikas
 ye sabhi baaten jitani adhik or prabal shringaar main pai jaati hai, utani anya rason main nahin
 Therefore, Rasraj is called the same
 raso kaa raja shringaar ras ko mana jaataa he Thinkers have also described the remaining rasas except for Raudra and Karun
 inamen sabase vistrut varnan shringaar kaa hi thahartaa he
 Shringar is mainly divided into two parts in the name of conjugation and vipralambha or disconnection, but some scholars like Dhananjaya etc
 consider the antecedent distinction of Vipralambha as a coincidence-antagonistic-non-preceding condition and the two distinctions from the name of the rest of abuse and intercourse
 And do
 sanyog kii anek paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par use aganeya maanakar use keval aashray bhed se nayakaarabdh, nayikaarabdh athwa ubhayaarabdh, prakaashan ke vichaar se prachhann tathaa prakaash yaa spasht or gupt tathaa prakashanprakaar ke vichaar se sankshipt, sankeern, sampannatar tathaa samrudhimaan naamak bhed kiye jate hai tathaa vipralambh ke purvanurag yaa abhilashahetuk, maan yaa ishryahetuk, pravaas, virah tathaa karun prilambh naamak bhed kiye gaye hai
 The antithesis of "poetry poetry" is new and the shapahutak distinction can only be accepted as a form of migration, "sahityadarpan" envisages the Karuna Vipralambha
 purvanurag kaaran kii drushti se gunshravan, pratyakshdarshan, chitradarshan, swapn tathaa indrajaal-darshan-janya evam raag sthirataa or chamak ke aadhaar par neeli, kusumbh tathaa manjistha naamak bhedon main baanta jaataa he
 In "alankarakoustubh", the soon-to-be-destroyed and not-so-beautiful raga is called the fourth by the name "haridra", which his commentator also calls "shyamarag"
 purvanurag kaa dash kaamadshaayen - abhilash, chintaa, anusmriti, gunakirthan, udvaig, vilaap, vyaadhi, jadta tathaa maran - maani gai hai, jinke sthaan par kahin apane tathaa kahin duusare ke mat ke rup main vishnudharmotarpurana, dasharupak kii avlok tikaa, sahityadarpan, prataparudriya tathaa saraswatikanthabharan tathaa kavyadarpan main kinchit parivartan ke saath chakshupriti, man:sang, samaran, nidrabhang, tanuta, vyavriti, lajjanaash, unmaad, muchrcha tathaa maran kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 By adding Sharadatanaya, desire and yearning, and Vidyanatha, his number is considered 12 by bringing resolution in place of remembrance and increasing delirium and beauty
 yah yuktiyukt nahin he or inkaa antarbhaav ho saktaa he
 There are two types in the name of mana-vipralambha pranay and jealousy and three types in the name of small, medium and guru, in consideration of stability of mana and severity of crime, three types in the name of vivaripalambha karyaja, shapaj, sambhramaja and the popularization of work or The future Gachpatravas or present and Gatpravas or the future Gachpatravas or the present and the Gatpravas or the Gharpravas, the tadrupas and forms of Shapaj, and a variety of reasons Nbramj of violence, weather, divine, man, and Prckradi distinction is
 virah gurujanadi kii sameeptha ke kaaran paas rahakar bhi nayika tathaa nayak ke sanyog ke hone kaa tathaa karun vipralambh mrityu ke ananthar bhi punerjeevan dwaara milan kii aashaa bani rahanevaale viyog ko kehete hai
 Nayikalankar, Ritu and Prakriti are also described under Shringar Rasa
 ek udhaaharan he- Similarly, the example of Shringar Rasa divided into two parts by the name of Sanyog and Vipralambha or Vioga- hasyaras ke vibhavbhed se aatmasth tathaa parastha evam hasya ke vikasvichaar se smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, apasit tathaa atihasit bhed karke unke bhi uttam, madhyam tathaa adham prakruti bhed se teen bhed karte hue unke antargat purvokt kramash: do-do bhedon ko rakhaa gaya he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas and a few other writers have made only four distinctions namely Mandhas, Kalhas, Atihas and Parihas angreji ke aadhaar par hasya ke anya anek naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai
 Examples - nayaa udhaaharan- There is no difference of quiet
 keval rudrabhatt ne avashya vairaygy, doshanigrah, santosh tathaa tatvasaakshaatkaar naam se iske chaar bhed die hai jo saadhan maatr ke naam he or inaki sankhya badhaai bhi ja sakati he
 Examples - bharatmuni ke ‘naatyashaastra’ main pratipaadit aath natyarason main shringaar or hasya ke anantar tathaa raudra se purv karun ras kii gananaa kii gai 
 'raudratu Karuno Rasa:' Saying 'karun Rasa' has its origin from 'raudra Rasa' and its origin is Shapajyaan Clash Vinipat, ishitjan-viprayag, Vibhava Nash, Slaughter, Bandhan, Vidarva means Exodus, Abuse, Addiction ie Objection etc
 Is accepted by chance
 saath hi nirved, glani, chintaa, autsukya, aaveg, moh, shram, bhay, vishaad, dainya, vyaadhi, jadta, unmaad, apsmaar, traas, aalasy, maran, stambh, vepathu, vevarnya, ashru, swarbhed aadi kii vyabhichaari yaa sanchari bhav ke rup main pariganit kiya he
 Examples - kavyagat rason main raudra ras kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Bharata has considered these four rasas as 'shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatas in the Natyasastra', so he has given the origin of other juices from them, namely- 'teshamutpattihetavchchatvaro Rasa: Shringaro Roudro Viro Vibhats Iti'
 raudra se karun ras kii utpatti bataate hue bharat kehete hai ki ‘raudrasyaev c yatkarm sa shey: karuno ras:’
 The deeds of raudra rasa are the father of compassion
 raudra ras kaa 'sthaayee bhav' 'krodh' he tathaa iskaa varna rakt evam devtaa rudra he
 The example of raudra rasa has already been inscribed from Keshavdas's 'ramachandrika'
 bhushan kii rachanaaon main bhi raudra ras ke udhaaharan mil jate hai
 In the present day, the compositions of Shyamnarayan Pandey and 'dinkar' have had an effective expression of raudra rasa
 sanskrit ke granthon main ‘mahabharat’ tathaa ‘vircharit’, ‘venisanhaar’ ityadi naatakon main raudra ras kii prabhoot abhivyakti hui he
 Examples - shringaar, raudra tathaa vibhats ke saath viraras ko bhi bharat muni ne mul rason main pariganit kiya he
 The origin of the amazing juice has been revealed from Veer Ras
 vir ras kaa 'varna' 'swarna' athwa 'gaur' tathaa devtaa indra kahe gayi hai
 It is associated with good nature and its abiding spirit is 'enthusiasm'
 vir ras ke keval yudhvir, dharmaveer, dayavir tathaa daanveer bhed sweekaar kiye jate hai
 Panditraj etc
 has made many other distinctions as the basis of enthusiasm
 udhaaharan - Bharatamuni of wonderful rasa has made two distinctions - Divya and Anandaj
 vaishnav acharya iske drusht, shrut, sankirtit tathaa anumit naamak bhed karte hai
 According to Bibhats Bharata and Dhananjaya, there are three types of pure, decaying and udvegi
 bhayanak karanbhed se vyajjanya yaa bhramajanit, aparaadhjanya yaa kaalpanik tathaa vitrasitak yaa vaastavik naam se teen prakaar kaa or swanishtha paranishth bhed se do prakaar kaa mana jaataa he
 On the basis of the similarity of a particular symptom of the permanence or of some sense of the juices, the tendency of the juices to enter into each other, to reject a permanence, to be considered as new permanent has also been shown occasionally
 yatha, shant ras or dayavir tathaa vibhats main se dayavir kaa shant main antarbhaav tathaa bibhats sthaayee jugupsa ko shant kaa sthaayee mana gaya he
 "nagananda" considers the play to be a play of calm and a play on mercy by Dayavir
 kintu yadi shant ke tatvagyanamoolak viraam or dayavir ke karunajanit utsaah par dhyaan diya jaae to donon main bhinnata dikhaai degi
 Similarly, the distraction in Jugupsa does not remain in the quiet
 shant raag-dwesh donon se pare samavastha or tatvagyansanmilit ras he jisamen jugupsa sanchari maatr ban sakati he
 Just like in Karun, there is a sense of sympathy and in Dayavir, but in Karun, there is a state of mourning and in Dayavir, there is a sympathetic self-proclaimed enthusiasm
 athwa, jaise raudra or yudhvir donon kaa alamban shatru he, at: donon main krodh kii maatra rahati he, parantu raudra main rahanevaali pramodpratikul tikshnata or avivek or yudhvir main utsah kii utfullata or vivek rahata he
 In anger, there is a sense of vengeance in hostility and in valor patience and generosity
 atev inkaa paraspar antarbhaav sambhav nahin
 Similarly, it is also not appropriate to consider "anmarsha" as permanent of Veer, because Amarsha manifests as Abhinivesh or self-respecting sense of mind due to condemnation, insult or objection, but in this kind of distinctions of Veeras called Dayavir, Danavir, and Dharmaveer The feeling does not last

 The monsoon low pressure region, alternatively known as the inter-tropical convergence zone, has a notable role in the formation of rainforests on Earth

 Rainforests account for 28% of the world's total oxygen gain, often misconstrued as oxygen production storing carbon as a medium through biological acquisition, processed by photosynthesis from carbon dioxide
 bhoomi str par surya kaa prakaash na pahunch paane ke kaaran varshawanon ke kai kshetron main bade vrikshon ke neeche chote paudhe or jhaadiyaan bahut kam ug paati hai

 There are two types of rainforest, tropical rainforest and temperate rainforest
 vishwa ke anek varshaavan monsoon ke kam dabaav ke kshetra vaale sthanon se sambhddha hai, jinhen antar-ushnkaribandheey sansruti kshetra ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Tropical rainforests are those rainforests that lie in the tropical tropics and are found near Jamaica and are present in sub-saharan Africa, South America, Central America, and many Pacific Islands from Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, Cameroon to Congo
 ushnkaribandheey varshawanon ko "prithvi ke fefde" kaha gaya he haalanki yah gyaat he ki ab prakaash sanshleshan ke madhyam se vayumandal ko shuddh oxigen pradaan karne main varshawanon kaa yogadan kam hi he
 Temperate rainforests are those rainforests that are in temperate regions
 ve uttari america, europe main, dakshin america or australia tathaa newjiland main bhi paae ja sakate hai
 a tropical rainforest is generally divided into four main layers, the outcrops, canopies, low-lying forest and forest sites, each containing different plants and organisms that adapt to that particular area
 nirgat parat main ek choti sankhya main atyant lambey vriksh, jinhein imargents kaha jaataa he, paae jate hai, jo vitanaavaran se oonche hote hai, 45-55 meter kii oonchai tak, haalanki kuch prajatiyaan to 70-80 meter tak pahunch jaati hai
 They need to be able to withstand hot temperatures and strong winds in some areas
 chil, titliyaan, chamagadad or kuch bandar is parat main rahete hai
 The canopy layer has the largest number of tall trees, usually 30–45 m tall
 jaivvividhta ke sarvaadhik ghaney kshetra vitanaavaran van main paae jate hai, asann pedo ke shirshon dwaara bane patton ke kamobesh nirantar aavaran se purna kshetra aachhadit rahata he
 According to some estimates, 50 percent of all plant species are here, meaning that half of the life on earth can be found in these
 in vishaal pedo ke tanon or shakhaon se lipte hue paraseete paudhe pani or khanij varsha or sahaayak paudhon par ekatrit malbe se praapt karte hai
 The animals here are similar to those found in the output layer, but they are more diverse
 aisa mana jaataa he ki sansar kii sabhi keet prajatiyon kaa ek chauthai vitanaavaran varshaavan main paae jate hai
 Scientists have long been suspicious of the richness of canopy forests in terms of habitat for flora and fauna, but more recently, practical methods of discovery have been developed
 bahut pehle 1917 main, prakrutivaadee wiliam bibe ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki "jivan kaa ek or mahadweep abhi khoja janaa shesh he, prithvi par nahin, lekin iske sau se do sau foot upar jo hajaaron varg mile tak failaa hua he
 "the true discovery of this natural population began in the 1980s, when scientists developed a way to reach the canopy by throwing ropes on trees using cross commands
 vitanaavaran paraton kaa anveshan abhi praarambhik avasthaa main hi he, lekin anya tareekon main sabase oonchi shakhaon ke upar se udne ke liye hawaii poton or gubbaaron kaa upyog shaamil he, tathaa vanasthal parat vitanaavaran or vanasthal ke bich sthit hoti he
 The lower forest canopy is a habitat for many creatures, including many types of birds, snakes and lizards, as well as predators such as jaguars, boa constrictors and leopards
 is str par pattey bahut bade hote hai
 Insect life is also abundant
 bahut se paudhe jo bade hokar vitanaavaran str tak jate hai, nimnasth van-vitan main maujuud hai
 Only 5% of the light of the sun shining above the rainforest reaches the lower forest
 is parat ko jhaadi parat bhi kaha ja saktaa he, yadhyapi jhaadi parat ko ek alag parat bhi mana ja saktaa he
 The forest layer is the lowest layer where only 2% of the sun's light reaches
 keval kam prakaash main anukulit paudhe hi is kshetra main ug sakate hai
 Far from the riverbanks, marshes and treeless lands where dense plants are found, the forestland is relatively vegetative, as very little sunlight reaches here
 yahaan par paudhon ke kshay or pashuon ke avshesh paae jate hai jo apghaton ko teevr karne vaale garm or namiyukt vaataavaran ke kaaran sheeghra hi gaayab ho jate hai
 Many types of fungi are found here which aid in the decomposition of animal and vegetable remains
 vishwa kii aadhe se adhik pashuon or paudhon kii prajatiyaan varshaavan main pai jaati hai
 The rainforest provides a favorable environment for a wide range of animals and birds, including mammals, reptiles, birds and invertebrates
 stanadhariyon main shaamil hai vanar, billi tathaa anya prajatiyaan
 Reptile families include snakes, tortoises, chameleons and other families while birds include those from the Vangidae and Cuculidae families
 aksherookiyon ke darjanon parivaar varshaavan main paae jate hai
 The fungus is also very common in the rainforest because it receives nutrition from the remains of decomposition of flora and fauna
 wanon kii kataai, vaas yogya sthaan main kami or vayumandal main jaivaracinic padaarthon ke utsarjan kii vajah se ye prajatiyaan teji se gaayab ho rahi hai
 Despite the growth of vegetation in a tropical rainforest, soil quality is often quite poor
 teevr jeevanvik apghaton dharan sanchay ko roktaa he
 The deposition of iron and aluminum oxide due to the lateritization process gives the oxisols a bright red color and sometimes forms minable deposits, such as bauxite

 yadi ped saaf kar die gaye, to varsha khuli mitti par hogi or use baha le jaaegi, antat jharne banenge, phir nadiyaan or baadh aana sambhav ho jayega
 a natural rainforest emits and absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide
 ek vaishvik paimaane par, lambii avadhi ke apshisht lagbhag santulan main rahe hai, taaki ek uthal-puthal rahit varshaavan kaa vayumandaleey carbon dioxide str par shuddh prabhaav bahut hi kam hoga
 Although they may have other climatic effects
 aaj kisi bhi varshaavan ko abaadhit nahin mana ja saktaa
 Human-induced deforestation has an important role behind the release of carbon dioxide by the rainforests, similar to natural processes such as drought that result in the elimination of trees
 kuch jalwaayu model paraspar prabhaav daalate hue vanaspati ke saath chalate hai or anumaan he ki 2050 ke aas paas sookhe ke kaaran amejan varshaavan ko ek badi haani hogi, jisase van dibec kaa shikaar hoga or tadnantar or adhik carbon dioxide mukt hogi
 Five million years from now, the Amazon rainforest must have dried up long before it would have transformed itself into Savannah
 hamaare gyaat jaanwaron ke vanshaj amejan ke purv varshaavan se bane sookhe savannah ke saath anukulan kar lenge or nae garm taapmaana main fale-phuulenge
 Tropical rainforests provide wood as well as animal products such as meat and hides
 varshaavan kaa paryaton sthalon ke rup main bhi or pradutt paristhitiki tantra sevaaon ke kaaran bhi mahatva he
 Many foods originally came from tropical forests and are still mostly grown in the terrain of the same area where the primary forests were previously
 iske alaava, vanaspati vyutpann aushadhiyon kaa aam taur se bukhaar, fungal sankraman, jalanaa, gastrointestinal samasyaon, dard, shwans rog or ghaav ke upachaar main prayog kiya jaataa he
 On 18 January 2007, FUNAI also reported that they had confirmed that from 40 in 2005 to now there are 67 uncontacted tribes in Brazil

 Biologists have speculated that a large number of species are being forced to go extinct due to the destruction of rainforests with their habitat being removed
 
 Another factor causing the degradation of rainforests is the expansion of urban areas
 jivan style main amul parivartan kii maang ko puraa karne ke liye ho rahe riban vikaas ke kaaran, purvi australia ke tateey kshetron main viksit ho rahe tatavarti varshaavan, ab durlabh ho gaye hai

 sarkari aankadon ke anusaar, amejan main wanon kii kataai kii dar 2007 ke baarah maheenon kii tulana main 2008 main 69 pratishat adhik ho gai
 According to a WWF news report, deforestation will destroy about 60 percent of the Amazon rainforests by 2030
 30 janvari 2009 ko neuyork times ke ek lekh main kaha gaya ki ek anumaan ke anusaar, har saal varshaavan ke kaate gaye prayek acre ke liye, katibandhon main 50 acre nae van ugaaye ja rahe hai

 This process takes place in three terms and iodomethane is formed as an intermediate
 carbonilikaran kii kriya main utprerak ke liye aamtaur par ek jatil dhaatu kii jarurat padati he 
 Acetic anhydride can also be made in the same plant by varying the process conditions
 kyonki mithenul or carbon monooxide donon hi kaccha maal hai, acetic amla ke utpaadan ke liye mithenul carbonylikaran lambey samay se ek aakarshak vidhi rahi he
 In 1925, Henry Dreyfius of British Silenese developed an experimental plant for methanol carbonylation
 haalanki vyaavhaarik saamagree kii kami jo ki sanksharak pratikriya mishran ko aavashyak ucch daab par rakh sake kii kami ne iske vyavsayikaran ko hatotsahit kiya
 The commercial methanol carbonylation process was first developed by the German chemical company BASF in 1963 using cobalt catalysts
 1968 main ek rhodium aadhaarit utprerak 2I2]−) kaa ijad kiya gaya jo prakriya ko bina kisi sahautpaada ke kam dabaav par kushaltapurvak sanchalit kar saktaa tha
 Using this catalyst, the US chemical Monsanto company set up the first plant in 1970, and rhodium-catalyzed methanol carbonylation became the most prominent method of production of acetic acid
 In the late 1990s, the chemical company BP Chemicals commercialized the advanced Cativa catalyst 2I2] -) with ruthenium
 ye iridium-utprerit ketiwa prakriya zyada harith or kushal he or isane bade paimaane par aksar unhi sanyantron main moncento prakriya ko pratisthapit kar diya
 Before the commercialization of the Monsanto process, most acetic acid was produced by oxidation of acetaldehyde
 ye duusari sabase mahatvapurn nirmaan paddati rahi he haalanki ye mithenul carbonilation ke saath pratispardhaa nahin kar sakati
 Acetaldehyde can be formed by oxidation of butane or mild naphtha or hydration of ethylene
 rasinic sameekaran ke anusaar jab beauten yaa halkaa nephtha ko hawa ke saath vibhinn dhaatu yanon jinamein mangneej, cobalt or chromium shaamil hai ki upasthiti main garm kiya jaataa he to prioxide banate hai or unke vighatan se acetic amla banataa he
 Usually this reaction is conducted by keeping the butane liquid as much as possible, keeping the combination of heat and pressure as hot as possible
 vishisht abhikriya paristhitiyaan 150 degree celsius or 55 atm hai
 By-products including butanone, ethyl acetate, formic acid, and propionic acid can also be formed
 ye sah utpaada bhi vanijyik rup se moolyawaan hai or agar ye aarthik rup se upyogi hai to inkaa zyada maatra main utpaadan karne ke liye abhikriya paristhitiyon ko parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the process of separating acetic acid from these by-products increases the cost
 beauten ke oxikaran ke liye upyogi paristhitiyon or utprerakon ko istemaal kar hawa kii oxigen se aciteldihide kaa oxikaran kar acetic amla banaaya ja saktaa he
 The acetic acid yield can be increased by this reaction using modern catalysts
 isamen banane vaale pramukh sah utpaadon ithyle acitate, formik amla or formeldihide ke kvathanank acetic amla se kam hote hai or inhe aswan dwaara aaraam se alag kar liya jaataa he
 Acetaldehyde from ethylene can also be made by the Wacker process and then oxidized according to the method shown above
 haal hi main rasayan company shova denko jisane 1997 main japan ke oita main ek ethaylin oxikaran sanyantr kholaa tha ne ithaylin se acetic amla roopantaran kii ek sasti ekal charan prakriya kaa vyavsayikaran kiya
 This process was carried out with the help of a palladium metal catalyst on a heteropoly acid such as tungastocylic acid
 ithaylin ki sthaneey keemton par nirbhar karte hue ise chote sanyantron ke liye mithenul carbonylikaran kaa pratispardhi mana gaya
 Much of human history has been made in the form of vinegar by the acetic acid genus Acetobacter bacteria
 paryaapt oxigen diye jane par ye jeevanu vibhinn alkoholi bhojya padaarthon se sirka kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 Commonly used feeds include apple distillation, alcohol and fermented grains, barley, rice, or potato pulp

 audyogic sirka nirmaan vidhi main is prakriya ko jeevanu ke liye oxigen aapurti ko badha kar tej kar diya jaataa he
 Vinegar was first made by fermentation, perhaps due to a fault in the wine making process
 agar bahut zyada taapmaana par kinvan ho rahaa he to angooron par swaabhaavik taur par aayaa khamir asitobacter se jarur bhar jayega
 jaise jaise khaadya, chikitsa auki swatchta ke liye sirka kii maang badi angoor kii sharaab ke vyapaariyon ne angooron ke paripakv hone or sharaab nirmit karne laayak hone se pehle garmi ke maheenon main duusare carbonic padaarthon se sirka bananaa sikh liya
 However, this method was slow and not always successful because the wine merchants did not understand the process
 germany main 1823 se pehle kaam main lee gai "teevr vidhi" yaa "german vidhi" sabase pehali aadhunik vanijyik prakriyaaon main se ek thi
 In this process, fermentation takes place in a dome closed with wood clipping or coal

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga upanishad hindu dharm ke mahatvapurn shruti dharmagranth hai
 These are integral parts of Vedic hymns
 inamen parameshwar, paramatma-brahm or aatma ke swabhaav or sambandh kaa bahut hi darshanik or gyanpurvak varnan diya gaya he
 In the Upanishads, knowledge was given importance by calling rituals 'inferior' because knowledge leads from gross to subtle
 brahm, jeev or jagat kaa gyaan paanaa upanishdon kii mul shiksha he
 Together with the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahmasutra Upanishads, they are called the 'departures' of Vedanta
 upanishad hi samast bhartiya darshanon ke mul strot hai, chaahe wo veydant ho yaa sankhya yaa jain dharm yaa buddha dharm
 The Upanishads themselves have also been called Vedanta
 duniya ke kai darshanik upanishdon ko sabase behtareen gyaanakosh maanate hai
 The Upanishads are an invaluable asset to the world of Indian civilization
 mukhya upanishad 12 yaa 13 hai
 Each is associated with some Veda
 ye sanskrit main likhe gayi hai
 In the 17th century, Dara Shikoh translated many Upanishads into Persian
 19veen sadi main german tatvaveta shopenhavar or maxmooler ne in granthon main jo ruchi dikhalaakar inke anuwaad kiye vah sarvavidit hai or mananeey hai
 The word Upanishad simply means 'close upavasana' or 'sitting close by'
 yah shabd ‘up’, ‘ni’ upsarg tathaa, ‘sad’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Sad Dhatu has three meanings: the destruction of details; Movement or knowing and sediment-relaxation
 upanishad main rishi or shishy ke bich bahut sundar or good samvaad he jo pathak ko veda ke marm tak pahunchaata he
 The Upanishads are the foundation of Indian spiritual thought, the source of Indian spiritual philosophy
 ve brahmavidya hai
 There are answers discovered by the sages of curiosities
 ve chintansheel rishiyon kii gyancharchaaon kaa saar hai
 They are poetic metaphysical creations of poet-hearted sages, attempts to discover the unknown, attempts to tie the indescribable superpower into words, and are written accounts of that formless, formless, boundless, inexhaustible desire to understand and define the inscrutable 
 vaidic yug sansaarik anand evam upbhog kaa yug tha
 It was an era of the piety, purity, sentimentality, naivete and sinlessness of the human mind
 jivan ko sampurna allhadpan se jeena hi us kaal ke logon kaa prey va shrey tha
 Seeing the various beautiful forms of nature, the emotions that emerged in the passionate minds of the people of that time in the form of spontaneous illumination waves, he termed them as prashas, praises, divine songs and poetic works and became Vedic rites or mantras
 un logon ke man sansaarik anand se bhare the, sampannataa se santusht the, prakritik divyataaon se bhav-vibhor ho uthte the
 Therefore, the desire in his songs is that this joy should always remain, grow and never end
 unhone kaamana kii ki is anand ko ham purna aayu sau varshon tak bhogen or hamaare baad kii peedhiyaan bhi isi prakaar trupt rahen
 Not only this, it was also wished that at the end of this life we should go to heaven and the continuation of this happiness and bliss should remain there too
 is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye vibhinn anushthan bhi kiye gaye or devataaon ko prasann karne ke aayojan karke unase ye vardaan bhi maange gaye
 When nature took a turn, natural calamities were encountered
 tab un vipattiyon kekaalpanik niyantrak devataaon yatha marut, agni, rudra aadi ko tusht va prasann karne ke anushthan kiye jate the or unase prarthana kii jaati thi ki aisi vipattiyon ko aane na den or unke aane par praja kii raksha karen
 Overall, the lives of the people of the Vedic period were cheerful, eloquent, well-meaning, optimistic, and lively
 unamem vishaad, paap yaa kshtmay jivan ke vichaar kii chaaya nahin thi
 Hell and the tortures found in it were not even imagined
 karm ko yajna or yajna ko hi karm mana gaya tha or usee ke sabhi sukhon kii prapti tathaa sankaton kaa nivaaran ho jane kii avadharana thi
 This lifestyle lasted for a long time
 par aisa kab tak chalata
 One day or the other, this curiosity had to arise in the infinitely inquisitive mind of man and never satisfied with the present, who is the creator behind this huge amphitheater of nature, who is its creator / creator, its origin
 Where is it, who are we, where have we come from, where will this creation eventually go
 hamaara kya hoga? shanai:-shanai: ye prashn ankurit hue
 And then began the quest to find answers to all this and the endless search journey of the curious mind-brain
 aisa nahin he ki aatma, punarjanm or karmfalwaad ke vishay main vaidic rishiyon ne kabhi sochaa hi nahin tha
 It was not that he did not care about this life
 rishiyon ne yada-kada is vishay par vichaar kiya bhi tha
 Its seeds are found here and there in the Vedas, but this was just a thought
 koi chintaa yaa bhay nahin
 The soul is a different element than the body, and after the end of this life, it goes to the other world, this principle is definitely found in the Vedic hymns, but the Vedic sages did not appear in the search for why the soul travels in the world
 apni samast simaaon ke saath sansaarik jivan vaidic rishiyon kaa prey tha
 The fear of leaving Preya and moving towards the credit arose at the time of the Upanishads, then the life of life in front of salvation was destroyed and when people instead of enjoying life started turning away from it and taking sannyas
 haan, yah bhi hua ki vaidic rishi jahaan yah puch kar shant ho jate the ki 'yah sristi kisne banaai he?' or 'koun devtaa he jisaki ham upasna karen'? vahaan upanishdon ke rishiyon ne sristi banane vaale ke sambandh main kuch siddhanton kaa nishchay kar diya or us 'sat' kaa bhi pataa paa liya jo puja or upasna kaa vastut: adhikaar he
 Vedas and new narratives of Vedic religion are Upanishads
 'vedon main yajna-dharm kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya or logon ko yah sikh di gai ki is jivan main sukhi, sampann tathaa sarvatra safal va vijayi rahane ke liye aavashyak he ki devataaon kii tushti va prasannataa ke liye yajna kiye jaaen
 Yajna is the place of origin of the world
 sabhi karmon main shreshth karm yajna he
 Heaven is attained by the results of the yajna
 ' ye hi sutara chaaron ore gunjit the
 Secondly, when the Brahmin texts gave great importance to the yajna and the arbitrariness of the priests and the priests increased immensely, then there was a reaction against this system and the spirit of protest was initiated
 log sochane lage ki 'yagyon kaa vaastavik arth kya he?' 'unke bheetar koun sa rahasy he?' 've dharm ke kis rup ke pratik hai?' 'kya ve hamen jivan ke charam lakshya tak pahunchaa denge?' is prakaar, karmkand par bahut adhik jor tathaa karmkandon ko hi jivan kii sabhi samasyaon ke hal ke rup main pratipaadit kiye jane kii pravriti ne vichaarvaan logon ko unke bare main punarvichaar karne ko prerit kiya
 The Vedic Aryans became polytheists while imagining a controlling deity in every form of nature
 unke devataaon main ullekhneey hai- indra, varun, agni, savita, som, ashvinikumar, marut, pushan, mitra, pitar, yama aadi
 Then an intellectual anxiety began to see that one superpower or to understand its true nature, which is the creator of the entire creation and the authority over these gods
 is vyagrata ne upanishad ke chintanon kaa maarg prashast kiya
 The Upanishads are philosophical poetic compositions of contemplative and imaginative mystics
 jahaan gadhy likh gaye hai ve bhi padyamay gadhy-rachanaaon main aisi shabd-shakti, dhvanyaatmakataa, lav evam arthgarbhita he ki ve kisi daivi shakti kii rachanaaon kaa abhas dete hai
 It is not really an exaggeration that he was called 'mantra' or 'richa'
 vastav main mantra yaa richa kaa sambandh veda se he parantu upanishdon kii hamatta darshane ke liye in sangyaaon kaa upyog yahan bhi katipay vidwaanon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The Upanishads are an attempt to peek behind the visible world around them
 iske liye na koi upkaran uplabdh hai or na kisi prakaar kii prayog-anusandhan suvidhaayen sambhav he
 Spiritual pulsation or divine light based on your mindset, mental experience or insight is the basis of the description
 upanishad aadhyaatmavidya ke vividh adhyay hai jo vibhinn ant:prerit rishiyon dwaara likhe gaye hai
 These include various metaphors and symbols describing the nature of the world, its location, its relationship with various natural powers, the glimpse of a ray in the human soul or the presence of a subtle reflection, etc
 sristi ke udgam evam uski rachana ke sambandh main gahan chintan tathaa swayanfoort kalpana se upje roopankan ko vividh bimbon or pratikon ke madhyam se prastut karne kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 In the end it was said that this is what we can understand based on our best hypothesis
 iske aage is rahasy ko shaayad paramatma hi jaanata ho or 'shaayad vah bhi nahin jaanata ho
 ' sankshep main, vedon main is sansar main drishyman evam prakat prakritik shaktiyon ke swaroop ko samajhane, unhen apni kalpanaanusaar vibhinn devataaon kaa jama pahanaakar unki aradhana karne, unhen tusht karne tathaa unase sansaarik safalataa va sampannataa evam suraksha paane ke praytn kiye gaye the
 Yagyas were created to convey their reverence to them
 upanishdon main un anek prayatnon kaa vivaran he jo in prakritik shaktiyon ke peeche kii paramashkti yaa sristi kii sarvocch satta se saakshaatkaar karne kii manokamana ke saath kiye gaye
 He tried his best to reach as far as human imagination, thinking ability, insight ability could reach the philosophers, mystics or sages of that time
 yahi unka tap tha
 The Veda has four parts - Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishads
 upanishad main aatm or anatm tattvon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he jo veda ke moulik rahasyon kaa pratipaadan karata he
 Often, the Upanishads come at the end of the Veda
 isliye ye veydant ke naam se bhi prakhyat hai
 The three major texts which authenticate the fundamental principles of Vedic religion, which are known by the name of Prasthanatrayi, are the Upanishads, Brahmasutra and Srimadbhagavadgita
 upanishad brahm vidya kaa dyotak he
 It is said that the practice of this knowledge destroys the ignorance of Mummukhujan; She makes Brahma attain; Due to which, the sorrows of human beings etc
, worldly sorrows are completely relaxed
 falat: upanishad ve ‘tatva’ pratipadak granth maane jate hai jinke abhyaas se manushya ko brahm athwa paramatma kaa saakshaatkaar hota he

 dhyaan yaa avdhaan chetan man kii ek prakriya he, jisamen vyakti apni chetana bahya jagat ke kisi chune hue daayre athwa sthalvishesh par kendrit karata he
 It is popularly synonymous with English "attention"
 hindi main iske saath "dena", "hataanaa", "rakhana" aadi sakarmak kriyaaon kaa prayog, isamen vyaktigat praytn kii anivaaryta siddh karata he
 Through meditation, we bring clarity and temperament of the chosen subject to the mental plane
 yogammat dhyaan se is saamaanya dhyaan main bada antar he
 The first is driven towards the spiritual goal by harnessing the power of long-term practice, while the second is physical and the ordinary day-to-day power is useful
 sampoornanand aadi kuch bhartiya vidvan yogammat dhyaan ko saamaanya dhyaan kii hi ek charam viksit avasthaa maanate hai
 Meditation is the goal of any human being detached from all external tasks and getting absorbed in any one task
 aashay yah he ki kisi ek kaary main kisi kaa itnaa lipt hona ki use samay,mausam,evam anay shaareerik jaruraton kaa bodh na rahe ise hi dhyaan kehete hai
 Meditation is of three types - dhyaan kaa ek failaav kshetra hota he
 In a limited time, meditation keeps circling only for a while in some counted objects
 udhaaharan ke liye, kamare main do teen mitra baaten karte hon to unke alag alag chehre, baat kaa vishay, kamare kii diwaal yaa calendar, mezposh yaa paperwet aadi hi kuch vastuen hai jo hamaare dhyaan ke failaav kshetra main us samay hai
 The outdoor environment of the room is outside that area
 sabase pehle is vishay par likhte hue darshanik lekhak volf ne dhyaan ko vishisht maanas gun mana
 William James's first well-known scientific explanation of this was to consider it to be a special dimension of the motion of "consciousness"
 ribbo ne dhyaan ko purvanuprerit kriya kaha
 Tichner pointed out with more scientific clarity that the goal subjects fall into the realm of consciousness and other things are marginalized around it
 yon dhyaan hamaari chetana kaa lakshya bindu banaata he
 The focus on margins gradually disappears, becoming extinct

 According to them, in the process of meditation, different object is seen when the whole object is changed from different perspective
 shatranj kii paati ko der tak dekhen, to kabhi kaale khaane ek varg main hokar safed ko prishthbhumi banaate hai or kabhi-kabhi safed hi aage aakar kaale khaanon ko peeche dhakel dete hai
 One of the largest lines in the middle of the three straight lines gives a sense of being out in the shape of the cornice in the whole picture
 mude hue ytaakar vastu kaa jyamithik chitra hamaare dhyaan ko uske bheetar evam baahar kii ore mude hone kaa baari baari se bodh karaata he
 In this way, there is a projection of consciousness even in our meditation
 catel nirmit tachistocope main vibhinn sankhya main chape spasht binduon ke card thodi der main ujagar kar chipa liye jate hai or dekhanewaalon se thik sankhya poochi jaati he
 The minimum number proves to be more obvious for meditation because the number of 4 was such that 100 percent people said it right

 There have also been many experimental examinations regarding meditation - the measurement of distance between the meditator and the meditator by Stevens and Hamilton, by Wittenborn on the classical method of statistical analysis of factor analysis, concurrence of the meditational process with numerology of digits in special case order; Relation of attention by accidental movements, oscillations or gestures by Morgan and Ford, and likewise new and old things; The symbolic relation of meditation to the first in sharp and dim qualities; The amount of flexion relative to muscles in meditation, etc
 dhyaanarahitya tathaa anymanskta dhyaan ke abhaav nahin hai balki ye dhyaan ke apekshit vastu par na lagaakar uske kahin or lage hone ke suchak hai
 Hamilton considered abstract thought or thinking to be the only complementary to meditation but a kind of prohibitive aspect

 The name "pagerank" is a trademark of Google and the pagerank process has been patented
 america patent 62,85,999 haalanki patent stanford vishvavidhyalay ko diya gaya he, na ki google ko
 Google has exclusive license rights from Stanford University
 patent ke prayog ke badale vishvavidhyalay ko google ke 1
8 million share mili; ye share 2005 main $336 million main bech diye gayi
 This is how Google describes pagerank: duusare shabdon main, ek pegerank world wide web par anya sabhi prishthon ke bich is bare main ek "matdaan" ke dwaara praapt hota he ki koi prishth kitna mahatvapurn he
 a hyperlink leading to a page is considered a vote of support
 prishth kaa pegerank doharaavpurn rup se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he or yah usase judanevaale sabhi prishthon ke pegerank metric or sankhya par nirbhar hota he
 The page with which many pages with high pagerank have created links automatically gets a high rank
 yadi ek web pej ke liye koi link na hon, to uske liye koi samarthan nahin hota
 Google provides a numeric load between 0–10 to every webpage on the Internet; This pagerank indicates the importance of a site in the eyes of Google
 pegerank ko praapt karne ke liye richter paimaane jaise ek laghuganakeey paimaane par ek saidhantik prayikta kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The pagerank of a specific page is largely dependent on the amount of inbound links as well as the pagerank of the pages that provide these links

 To protect against rigging, fraud, and spamdexing, Google does not provide specific details about how other factors affect pagerank
 pej or brin ke mul shodh-patr ke baad se pegerank se sambandhit anek shaikshanik shodh-patr prakashit ho chuke hai
 In practice, the concept of pagerank has proven to be unsafe for rigging and intensive research has been devoted to identifying incorrectly enhanced pagerank and methods of neglecting documents associated with incorrectly enhanced pagerank
 web prishthon ke liye link-aadhaarit anya elgorithamon main jon clinberg dwaara khoja gaya HITS algaridam, IBM CLEVER pariyojna or trustrank algaridam shaamil hai
 pagerank was developed by Larry Page at Stanford University and later by Sergey Brin as part of a new type of search engine-related research project
 is pariyojna ke bare main pehla shodh-patr, jisamen pegerank or Google search ingine kaa praarambhik prototip tha, 1998 main prakashit hua: kuch hi samay baad pej or brin ne Google Inc
, google search ingine kii nirmaataa company, kii sthapana kii
 In addition to being one of the many factors that determine the ranking of Google search results, pagerank also provides the basis for all of Google's web search tools
 pegerank par avataran vishleshan, pehle pencilvenia vishvavidhyalay main 1950 ke dashak main ujin garfield dwaara viksit or hyper search, padua vishvavidhyalay main mysimo marchiori dwaara viksit, se prabhavit rahaa he

 In 2010, a 1941 research paper by Viceroy Leontief, a Harvard economist and 1973 Nobel laureate, was identified as the early intellectual predecessor to the repetitive methodology of pagerank
 pegerank ek prayikta vitaran he, jiskaa prayog yadrichhik rup se links par clic karanevaale vyakti ke kisi vishisht prishth par pahunchane kii sambhaavna ko pradarshit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 pagerank can be calculated for the collection of documents of any size
 anek shodh patron main yah mana jaataa he ki gananaa prakriya ke prarambh main hi yah vitaran sangrah ke sabhi dastavejon ke bich samaan rup se vibhajit kar diya jaataa he
 pagerank calculations require repeating multiple cycles of collection, called "iteration", to adjust the approximate values of pagerank to more closely reflect the theoretically pure value
 ek prayikta 0 or 1 ke bich kisi sankhyatmak maan ke rup main vyakt kii jaati he
 a 0
5 probability is commonly expressed as a "50% probability" of an action taking place
 atah 0
5 pegerank kaa arth he ki is baat kii 50% sambhaavna he ki kisi yadrichhik link par clic karanevaala koi vyakti 0
5 pegerank vaale kisi dastavej kii ore bheja jayega
 Consider a small universe of four web pages: A, B, c and D
 pegerank kaa praarambhik anumaan in chaaron dastavejon ke bich samaan rup se baanta jayega
 atah prayek dastavej ek 0
25 ke anumaanit pegerank ke saath prarambh karegaa
 pagerank originally had initial values of only 1
 iskaa arth yah he ki sabhi prishthon kaa yogafal web par prishthon kii kul sankhya ke baraabar tha
 Later versions of pagerank assume a probability division between 0 and 1
 yahaan ek saral prayikta vitaran kaa prayog kiya jayega- atah praarambhik maan 0
25 liya gaya he
 If pages B, c and d provide links for a only, then each of them will give 0
25 pagerank to page A
 is prakaar is saral pranali main sabhi pegerank PR a par ekatrit hon jaaenge kyonki sabhi links a ko suchit kar rahe honge
 This is 0
75
 punah, mana ki prishth b ke paas prishth c ke liye bhi ek link he or prishth d ke paas teenon prishthon ke liye link he
 The value of link-votes is divided among all outgoing links on a page
 is prakaar prishth b dwaara prishth a ko diye jane vaale mat kaa mulya 0
125 or prishth c ko diye jane vaale mat kaa mulya 0
125 he
 Only one-third of D's pagerank is calculated for A's pagerank
 duusare shabdon main, bahirgami prishthon dwaara pradaan kiya jane vaala pegerank dastavej ke swayan ke pegerank score or bahirgami links kii prasamanyikrut sankhya l ke bhagfal ke baraabar hota he 
 In the normal case, the pagerank value of a page u can be expressed as: arthath prishth u kaa pegerank maan samucchya Bu ke prayek prishth v ke pegerank maan or prishth v se nikalanevaale links kii sankhya l ke bhagfal par nirbhar hota he
 The pagerank theory holds that even an imaginary user randomly clicking on links will eventually stop clicking
 kisi bhi charan main, vyakti dwaara kaary jari rakhe jane kii sambhaavna, ek udaseenta kaarak d hoti he
 Various studies have tested various attrition factors, but it is generally believed that the attrition factor will be set around 0
85
 udaseenta kaarak ko 1 se ghataya jaataa he se bhaag diya jaataa he) or iske baad is maan ko udaseenta kaarak or antargami pegerank score se gunanfal main joda jaataa he
 meaning, atah kisi bhi prishth kaa pegerank mukhyatah anya prishthon ke pegerank se praapt kiya jaataa he
 The attrition value adjusts the received value downward
 haalanki mul shodh-patr main ek bhinn sutara diya gaya, jisase kuch bhram kii sthiti utpann hui: The difference between these two is that the sum of the pagerank values in the first formula is one, while in the second formula each pagerank is multiplied by n and the sum becomes N
 pej or brin ke shodh-patr kaa ek kathan ki "sabhi pegerankon kaa yogafal ek hota he" or google ke anya karmchaariyon ke daawey uparokt sutara ke pehle sanskaran kaa samarthan karte hai
 Each time Google crawls the web, Google recalculates pagerank's score and rebuilds its index
 google dwaara apane sangrahan main dastavejon kii sankhya badhaaye jane ke saath hi, sabhi dastavejon ke liye pegerank kaa praarambhik anumaan bhi ghatata jaataa he
 This formula uses a model of random surfer, which after a few clicks gets bored and moves to a random page
 kisi prishth kaa pegerank maan is baat kii sambhaavna ko pratibimbit karata he ki random sarfar kisi link par clic karke us prishth par pahonchega
 ise ek marcove shrinkhalaa ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he, jisamen avasthaaen prishth hoti hai or sabhi parivartanon kii prayikta samaan hoti he or ve prishthon ke bich link hote hai
 If a page does not contain any links to other pages, it becomes a sink and thus terminates the random surfing process
 haalanki, samaadhaan bahut saral he
 If the random surfer arrives at a sync page, he randomly chooses another URL and continues surfing again
 jin prishthon main koi bahirgami link na hon, pegerank kii gananaa karte samay unhen sangrah ke anya sabhi prishthon se judaa hua mana jaataa he
 Hence their pagerank scores are divided equally among all other pages
 duusare shabdon main, jo prishth sinc nahin hai, unke saath nyaay karne ke liye, ye yadrichhik parivartan web main sabhi nodes main, saamanytah d =0
85 kii ek shesh prayikta ke saath jode jate hai, jiskaa akalan is aavriti se kiya jaataa he ki ek ausat surfar apane brouzar kii buchamark visheshta kaa prayog karata he
 Hence, the equation is as follows: jahaan p 1 , p 2 , 
 
 
, p n { \ displaystyle p_{1},p_{2},


,p_{n}} ve prishth hai, jin par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he, m { \ displaystyle M} un prishthon kaa samucchy he, jo p i { \ displaystyle p_{i}} se judate hai, l { \ displaystyle L} prishth p j { \ displaystyle p_{j}} par bahirgami links kii sankhya he or n prishthon kii kul sankhya he
 The pagerank values are the entries of the effective eigenvector of the modified proximity matrix
 yah pegerank ko ek vishisht rup se aakarshak metrics banaata he: ijanvector he Where r is the solution to the equation jahaan nikatataa function l { \ displaystyle \ ell } 0 hota he, yadi prishth p i { \ displaystyle p_{i}} prishth p j { \ displaystyle p_{j}} se na judata ho or iskaa prasamanyikaran is prakaar kiya jaataa he ki prayek i ke liye That is, the sum of the elements of each column is up to 1
 It is a variant of eigenvector centrality measurement, commonly used in network analysis
 uparokt sanshodhit ijanvector metrics main bade aaijangap ke karanpegerank ijanvector ke maanon kaa anumaan tivrata se lagaaya ja saktaa he 
 As a result of Markov theory, it can be shown that the pagerank of a page is the probability of being on that page after several clicks
 yah t − 1 { \ displaystyle t^{-1}} ke baraabar hota he, jahaan t { \ displaystyle t} kisi prishth se punah usee prishth par waapas aane ke liye aavashyak clic kii sankhya kaa anumaan he
 Its main drawback is that it is biased towards older pages because the new page, even if it is very good, will not have many links unless it is a part of an old site
 Google Directory allows users to view pages sorted according to pagerank under categories
 google diarectry google dwaara pradaan kii jane vaali ekmaatr seva he, jahaan pegerank nirdeshika pradarshan kram kaa nirdhaaran karti he
 In Google's other search services, pagerank is used to measure the relevant scores of pages displayed in search results
 pegerank kii gananaa ko gati pradaan karne ke liye vibhinn ranneetiyaan prastaavit kii gayi hai
 Various strategies have been implemented to make changes to pagerank as part of strong efforts to improve the ranking of search results and monetize ad links

 Google is known for punishing link forms and other schemes designed to artificially increase pagerank
 disambar 2007 main, google ne bhugtan ke dwaara text link bechney vaali citon ko sakriy rup se dandit karnaa shuru kiya
 How Google identifies link farms and other tools for making pagerank changes is one of Google's trade secrets
 sankshep main, pegerank kii gananaa doharaavpurn rup se yaa bijaganitiya rup se kii ja sakati he
 Alternatively, the power repeat method, or the power method, can be used
 pehali sthiti main, t = 0 { \ displaystyle t=0} par, ek praarambhik prayikta vitaran mana jaataa he, saamanytah Calculations at each time step provide the following results, as described above yaa matrix sanketan main Where r i = PR { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {R} _ {i} = PR} and 1 { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {1}} is a column vector of length n { \ displaystyle N} having only one
 metrics m { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {M}}} ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya jaataa he meaning, jahaan a { \ displaystyle A} graph ke nikatataa metrics ko suchit karata he or k { \ displaystyle K} vikarn main bahari degree ke saath ek vikarn metrics he
 The calculation ends when for a small ε { \ displaystyle \ epsilon} arthath jab abhisaran mana jaataa he
 In the second case, t → ∞ { \ displaystyle t \ to \ infty}, the above equation follows samaadhaan nimnlikhit ke dwaara diya jaataa he i { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {I}} of identity metrics
 samaadhaan uplabdh he or yah 0 { \ displaystyle 0} ke liye adwitiya hota he
 This can be seen by noting that m { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {M}}} is a stochastic matrix by its construction and therefore its eigenvalue due to the Peron – Frobenius theorem
 yadi metrics m { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {M}}} ek parivartan sambhaavna he, arthath stambh-stocastic, jisamen kisi stambh menkeval shunya nahin hai or r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {R} } ek prayikta vitaran he, sameekaran nimnlikhit ke samatuly he Thus pagerank r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {R}} is the main eigenvector of m ^ { \ displaystyle { \ widehat { \ mathcal {M xxrep 4 } 
 isaki gananaa karne kii ek tej or saral paddati ghaat vidhi kaa prayog karnaa he: ek aniyantrit vector x { \ displaystyle x} se shuru karte hue, oparator m ^ { \ displaystyle { \ widehat { \ mathcal {M xxrep 4 } ko anukram main lagu kiya jaataa he, arthath, Unless dhyaan den ki sameekaran main, dahini ore koshthkon main likhe metrics kii vyakhya is prakaar kii ja sakati he Where p { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {P}} is an initial probability distribution
 vartmaan sthiti main Finally, if m { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {M}}} only contains columns with zero values, then the initial probability vector p { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {P}} should be replaced
 duusare shabdon main Where the matrix d { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {D}}} is defined as follows
 nimnlikhit ke saath Both of the above calculations using only m { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {M}}} give the same pagerank if their results are not normalized
 gananaa ke liye prayukt dhaanche, in vidhiyon ke sateek kriyanvayan or parinaamon kii aavashyak achookta ke aadhaar par in teen vidhiyon ke gananaa samay main bahut adhik antar ho saktaa he
 Generally, if the calculation is to be done multiple times or the network size is large, due to the reversal of the matrix, algebraic calculations are slower and more memory consuming and the power method is most efficient
 google tulbaar kii pegerank visheshta dekhe gaye prishth ke pegerank ko 0 se 1 ke bich ek purnank sankhya ke rup main darshaati he

 SERP is the actual result provided by the search engine in response to a keyword
 SERP main sambandhit paathya-khandon vaale sabhi web prishthon ke liye links kii ek suchi hoti he
 The SERP rank of a web page indicates the establishment of a related link on the SERP, where a higher establishment means a higher SERP rank
 a web page's SERP rank is not only a function of its pagerank, but also relies on a relatively large and constantly adjusting set of factors, commonly referred to as "google Love" by Internet marketers
 SEO kaa lakshya ek website yaa web prishthon ke samooh ke liye ucchtam sambhav SERP rank praapt karnaa hota he
 The Google Directory pagerank is an 8-unit measurement
 in maanon ko google diarectry main dekha ja saktaa he
 Unlike the Google Toolbar, which displays a pagerank value when the mouse is moved over a green plaque, the Google Directory displays pagerank not as a numeric value, but only as a green plaque
 haalanki adhikansh citon ke liye tulbaar main pradarshit pegerank ko vaastavik pegerank maan se praapt mana jaataa he, parantu is baat par dhyaan dena aavashyak he ki is maan ko saralata se badal diya jaataa tha
 a previous drawback was that any page with a low pagerank sent to a page with a high pagerank, by an HTTP 302 response or a "refresh" meta tag, would obtain the pagerank of the destination page
 saidhantik rup se, koi PR 0 pej, jisamen antargami link na hon, ko google ke home pej kii ore bheja ja saktaa tha- jiskaa PR 10 he- or phir vah nae prishth kaa PR unnat hokar PR10 ho jaataa
 spoofing kii yah takanic, jise 302 google jacking bhi kaha jaataa he, pranali main ek vifaltaa yaa truti ke rup main jaani jaati thi
 The pagerank of any page can be changed as the webmaster wishes, and only Google has access to the actual pagerank of the page
 spoofing kii pahchaan saamanytah sandigdh pegerank vaale URL ke liye ek google khoj chalaakar kii jaati he kyonki parinaam ek purnatah bhinn site kaa URL pradarshit karenge
 For the purpose of search engine optimization, some companies offer webmasters to sell high pagerank links
 chunki ucch-pr vaale prishthon se praapt links ko adhik moolyawaan mana jaataa he, atah ve adhik mahange hote hai
 Purchasing link ads on high quality content pages and relevant sites can be an effective and viable marketing strategy to get more traffic and increase the webmaster's link popularity
 haalanki google ne saarvajanik rup se webmastaron ko chetavanee di he ki yadi ve pegerank or sammaan dene ke uddeshy se links ko bechate hai yaa aisa karte hue paae gaye, to unki links kaa avamulyan kiya jayega 
 links kharidne or bechney kii paddati webmaster samudaay ke bich atyadhik bahes kaa vishay he
 Google has advised webmasters to use nofollow HTML attribute values on sponsored links
 mat kats ke anusaar, google un webmastaron ke prati chintit he, jo tantra ke saath khilwaad karne kaa prayaas karte hai or iske kaaran google ke search parinaamon kii gunvattta or vishwasaneeyata ko gata dete hai
 The original pagerank algorithm reflects the so-called random surfer model, which means that the pagerank of a specific page is derived from the theoretical probability of arriving at that page at random clicking on links
 haalanki, vaastavik prayokta web kaa prayog yadrichhik rup se nahin karte, balki apni ruchi or uddeshy ke anusaar links par jate hai
 a page ranking model, which reflects the importance of a specific page as a function of how many real users actually saw it, is called a deliberate surfer model
 google tulbaar dekhe gaye prayek prishth kii soochna google ko bhejtaa he or aisa karke suvichaarit surfar model par aadhaarit pegerank gananaa ke liye aadhaar pradaan karata he
 The side effect of using nofollow attribute by Google to counter spamdexing is that webmasters generally use it to increase their own pagerank on outgoing links
 iske parinamswaroop web croleron ke liye anupaalan hetu vaastavik link kii haani hoti he, jo yadrichhik surfar model par aadhaarit mul pegerank algaridam ko avishwasaneey bana detaa he
 Analyzing the information provided by Google about users' browsing habits somewhat compensates for the loss of information caused by the nofollow attribute
 ek prishth kaa SERP rank, jo ki khoj ke parinaamon main prishth kii vaastavik sthiti kaa nirdhaaran karata he, anya karkon ke atirikt yadrichhik surfar model or suvichaarit surfar model ke sangyojan par aadhaarit hota he
 a version of pagerank has recently been proposed as a replacement for the traditional] impact factor and has been applied to eigenfactor
org
 keval kisi patrika ke avataranon ko ginaney kii bajaay, ek pegerank paddati se prayek avataran ke "mahatv" kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 a similar use of pagerank is a new use of pagerank by academic research programs to rank their graduates based on their records to place them in professor positions
 pegerank ke sandarbh main, shaikshanik vibhaag ek duusare se praadhyaapakon ko naukari dekar ek-duusare se jude hote hai
 pagerank has been used to rank places or roads, so that it can be estimated how many people come to a place or road
 
 shabdic arth vigyaan main iskaa prayog shabd arth asandigdhta or vardenet sinsets ko is aadhaar par swachaalit rup se shreneebaddh karne ke liye kiya jaataa he ki unamem kitni majbooti se koi arth vigyaan visheshta, jaise dhanaatmakataa yaa rinaatmakataa, upasthit he
 Another dynamic loading method, similar to pagerank, has been used to build reading lists based on Wikipedia's link structure as per interest
 ek web crollar pegerank kaa prayog is baat ke nirdhaaran ke anek mahatvapurn metrics main se ek ke rup main kar saktaa he ki web ke ek crol ke dauraan aage kis URL par janaa he
 One of the initial tasks that Google used during its creation is Efficient crawling through URL ordering, which discusses the use of various important metrics to determine how deep Google and a site is To what part of it will crawl
 pegerank ko in anek mahatvapurn metrics main se ek ke rup main prastut kiya gaya he, haalanki kuch anya bhi soochibaddh kiye gaye hai, jaise kisi URL ke liye antargami or bahirgami links kii sankhya or kisi site par URL se mul nirdeshika tak kii duuri
 pagerank can also be used as a method of measuring the visible impact of a community such as the blogosphere across the web
 atah yah drushtikon maapan-mukt network pratimaan ke pratibimb main dhyaan ke vitaran kaa maapan karne ke liye pegerank kaa prayog karata he
 In any ecosystem, a modified version of pagerank can be used to determine species that are necessary to maintain the health of the environment
 "nofollow" option==2005 ke prarambh main, HTML link or ankar tatv ke rel atribute ke liye, google ne ek nayaa maan "nofollow" lagu kiya, taaki website vikasakarta or blogar aise link bana saken, jin par google pegerank ke uddeshyon ke liye vichaar nahin karegaa- ye ve links hai, jo pegerank pranali main ab "matdaan" nahin karte
 nofollow sambandh ko spamdexing se muqaabala karne main sahaayta ke ek prayaas ke rup main joda gaya tha
 As an example, in order to increase their pagerank, people used to create many message-board entries that had links to their websites
 nofollow maan ke saath, massej-board pravishtiyon main sabhi hiserlinks main swachaalit rup se "rel='nofollow'" pravisht karne ke liye prashaasak apane code ko sanshodhit kar sakate hai or is prakaar pegerank ko un vishisht pravishtiyon dwaara prabhavit hone se bachaaya ja saktaa he
 However, this method of avoidance also has various drawbacks, such as reducing the link value of actual observations
 kisi website ke prishthon ke antargat pegerank ke pravaah ko maanviya rup se niyantrit karne ke ek prayaas main, anek webmaster pegerank scalpating naamak paddati kaa prayog karte hai- jo ki nofollow atribute ko ranneetik rup se website ke vishisht aantarik links par rakhane kaa kaary he, taaki pegerank ko un prishthon kii ore modaa ja sake, jinhen webmaster sabase mahatvapurn maanata he
 This trick has been used since the birth of the nofollow attribute, but many believe that the technique has lost its efficacy
 14 oktober 2009 ko google ke karmchaaree suzan moskva ne pushti kii ki company ne pegerank ko apane webmaster tuls khand se hataa diya he
 His entry partially stated that "we have been telling people for a long time that they should not focus so much on pagerank; it seems that many site owners think that this is the most important measurement for them, which That is not true
 "moskva kii pushti ke do dinon baad tak bhi pegerank ko google tulbaar ke web upkarnon par pradarshit kiya jaataa rahaa or march 2010 tak kii jaankaree ke anusaar yah abhi bhi pradarshit ho rahaa he
