 suprasiddh sahitya darpan main kaha gaya he hriday kaa sthaayee bhav, jab vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav kaa sanyog praapt kar letaa he to ras rup main nishpann ho jaataa he
 Dev, the chief poet of Reetikal, has defined rasa in these words: is prakaar ras ke chaar ang hai - sthaayee bhav, vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav
 Bhava means: -hona sahruday ke ant:karan main jo manovikar vaasana yaa sanskaar rup main sadaa vidyaman rahete hai tathaa jinhen koi bhi virdohi yaa avirohi dabaa nahin saktaa, unhen sthaayee bhav kehete hai
 They reside in the human mind in seed form, stagnant for a long time
 ye sanskaar yaa bhaavana ke dyotak hai
 They are hidden in humans in the same way as the smell in the soil is absorbed in a different way

 ye ras kii utpatti main aadharbhoot maane jate hai
 There are two differences of influence: bhaavon kaa udgam jis mukhya bhav yaa vastu ke kaaran ho vah kavy kaa alamban kaha jaataa he
 Subjects and shelter come under suspension
 jis paatr ke prati kisi paatr ke bhav jaagrit hote hai vah vishay he
 In literature, this topic is called Alamban Vibhava or 'alamban'
 jis paatr main bhav jaagrit hote hai vah aashray kehalaata he
 The causal factor in keeping the permanent feeling awake is called stimulation effect
 udhaaharan swaroop vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah ke liye saamne khadaa hua shatru alamban vibhaav he
 The army with the enemy, the instruments of war and the enemy's robes, roar-lines, arms operations, etc
 are the stimulus effects
 uddipan vibhaav ke do prakaar maane gayi hai: Meaning the powers and gestures of standing arthath vaataavaran se sambandhit vasteen
 Natural scenes are also counted under these
 rati, haas, shok aadi sthaayee bhaavon ko prakashit yaa vyakt karne vaali aashray kii cheshtaaen anubhav kehalaati hai
 These gestures originate in the shelter after emotional awakening, hence they are called Anubhav, that is, one who follows the emotion is called Anubhav
 anubhav ke do bhed hai - icchit or anichhit
 The actions which occur in the ordinary folk publishing the emotions, generated by their own causes through dedication and stimulation, are called poetic dramas etc
 udhaaharan swaroop virah-vyakul nayak dwaara sisakiyaan bharna, milan ke bhaavon main ashru, swead, romaanch, anuraag sahit dekhnaa, krodh jaagrit hone par shastr sanchaalan, kathor vaani, ankhon kaa laal ho janaa aadi anubhav kahe jaaenge
 Simple experience: There are four distinctions
 1
angik 2
vaachik 3
 aharya 4
 satvik
 The physiological efforts of the asylum are asexual or somatic
 rati bhav ke jaagrath hone par bhu-vikshep, kataaksh aadi praytn purvak kiye gayi vagvyapaar vaachik anubhav hai
 Superimposed or artificial dress design is dietary experience
 parantu, sthaayee bhav ke jaagrath hone par swaabhaavik, akrutrim, aytnaj, angavikar ko satvik anubhav kehete hai
 For this, the shelter does not have to make any external efforts
 isliye ye aytnaj kahe jate hai
 They are self-generating and cannot be stopped
 satvik anubhav : arthath aath bhed hai - stambh, swead, romaanch, swarbhang, vepathu, vaivarny, ashru or pralay
 Those expressions which come in a helpful form only to confirm the permanent feeling for a short time and immediately disappear, are communicable
 sanchari shabd kaa arth he, saath-saath chalanaa arthath sancharanshil hona, sanchari bhav sthaayee bhav ke saath sancharit hote hai, inamen itnaa sarmathy hota he ki ye prayek sthaayee bhav ke saath uske anukool banakar chal sakate hai
 Therefore they are also called adulterous expressions
 sanchari yaa vyabhichaari bhaavon kii sankhya 33 maani gayi he - nirved, glani, shankaa, asuya, mad, shram, aalasy, deenta, chintaa, moh, smriti, dhruthi, vrida, chapalya, harsh, aaveg, jadta, garv, vishaad, autsukya, nidra, apsmaar, swapn, prabodh, amarsh, avhittha, ugrata, mati, vyaadhi, unmaad, maran, traas or vitark
 Bharatamuni, while revealing rasa as an essential element of poetry, has clearly mentioned its eight distinctions under the names Shringar, Humor, Raudra, Karun, Veer, Kavach, Bibhatsa and Bhavya and based on certain lines, scholars imagine that He has also approved the ninth juice called Shanta
 inhen nau rason kii sangya he navras
 These juices result from the coincidence of vibrancy-communicable
 prayek ras kaa sthayibhav alag-alag nishchit he
 The Nirvighna-prati-adhyabha stage which is fulfilled by its Vibhavadi coincidence is called Rasa
 shringaar kaa sthaayee rati, hasya kaa haas, raudra kaa krodh, karun kaa shok, vir kaa utsaah, adbhut kaa vismay, bibhats kaa jugupsa, bhayanak kaa bhay tathaa shant kaa sthaayee sham yaa nirved kehalaata he
 Bharata has considered Vishnu, Pramatha, Rudra, Yamraj, Indra, Brahma, Mahakal and Kaldev, the deities of the eight Rasas respectively
 shant ras ke devtaa narayan or uskaa varna kundetu bataaya jaataa he
 The first eight rasas are considered as Shyam, Sit, Rakht, Kapot, Gaur, Peet, Neel and Krishna Varna respectively
 bharat ne pratham aath rason main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats ko pradhan maanakar kramash: hasya, karun, adbhut tathaa bhayanak ras kii utpatti maani he
 The humor of Shringar arises as a result of humor, raudra and heroic deeds resulting from compassion and the amazing and gruesome philosophy
 anukriti kaa arth, abhinavgupt ke shabdon main abhas he, at: kisi bhi ras kaa abhas hasya kaa utpaadak ho saktaa he
 Deformed prostitutes are also funny
 raudra kaa kaary vinaash hota he, at: usase karun kii tathaa virkarm kaa karta praaia: ashakya kaaryon ko bhi karte dekha jaataa he, at: usase adbhut kii utpatti swaabhaavik lagati he
 Similarly, the origin of the terrible is also possible from Bibhatsadarshan
 akele smashanadi kaa darshan bhayotpadak hota he
 However, this genesis theory cannot be said to be absolute, because the raksha or heroic rasa of the altar can also create the terrible for the spontaneous, and the origin of calm is also possible from the horrors
 raudra se bhayanak, shringaar se adbhut or vir tathaa bhayanak se karun kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 In fact the opinion of Bharata is not clear
 unke pashchaat dhananjay ne chitt kii vikaas, vistaar, vikshobh tathaa vikshep naamak chaar avasthaaen maanakar shringaar tathaa hasya ko vikaas, vir tathaa adbhut ko vistaar, bibhats tathaa bhayanak ko vikshobh or raudra tathaa karun ko vikshepavastha se sambandhit mana he
 But the scholars who believe only three states, called Druti, Vistara and Vikas, will not be solved by this classification
 isi prakaar yadi shringaar main chitt kii dravit sthiti, hasya tathaa adbhut main uskaa vistaar, vir tathaa raudra main uski dipti tathaa bibhats or bhayanak main uskaa sankoch maan len to bhi bharat kaa kram thik nahin baithta
 The presence of one situation with another is also not impossible
 adbhut or vir main vistaar ke saath dipti tathaa karun main druti or sankoch donon hai
 Nevertheless, there is so much indication from the establishment of a Bharathakrita relation that there is mutual reciprocity in the said rasas and they are friends and associates of each other
 mitrataa ke samaan hi in rason kii prayogsthiti ke anusaar inke virodh kii kalpana bhi kii gai he
 Which other juices, along with which other juices will be immediately hindered in taste, this opposition is based on this idea
 karun, bibhats, raudra, vir or bhayanak se shringaar kaa; bhayanak or karun se hasya kaa; hasya or shringaar se karun kaa; hasya, shringaar or bhayanak se raudra kaa; shringaar, vir, raudra, hasya or shaat se bhayanak kaa; bhayanak or shant se vir kaa; vir, shringaar, raudra, hasya or bhayanak se shant kaa virodh mana jaataa he
 This protest is present due to shelter, communion, communion or continuity
 prabandh kavy main hi is virodh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In Muktak, there is no fear of ending with the verses of the subject
 lekhak ko virdohi rason kaa aashray tathaa alambanon ko pruthak-pruthak rakhkar athwa do virdohi rason ke bich donon ke mitra ras ko upasthit karke yaa pradhan ras kii apeksha angaras kaa sancharivat upasthit karke is virodh se utpann aswaad-vyaghaat ko upasthit hone se bachaa lenaa chahie
 Considering the deliciousness of the juice, it is said to be Brahmananda sibling, Swaprakasananda, eccentric etc
 and on this basis all the juices are considered to be enjoyable
 bhattnayak ne satvodrake ke kaaran mamatv-paratv-hin dasha, abhinavgupt ne nirvighn pratiti tathaa aanandavardhan ne karun main maadhurya tathaa ardrata kii avasthit bataate hue shringaar, vipralambh tathaa karun ko uttarottar prakarshamay bataakar sabhi rason kii anandswarupata kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 But by considering the sentiments based on favorable sentimentality and unfavorable sentimentality, Rudrabhatta Ramchandra Gunachandra, Haripal, and Dhananjaya and Acharya Ramchandra Shukla in Hindi have considered the juxtaposition of the rashas and the sadistic sensations
 abhinavgupt ne in sabase pehle hi "abhinavbharti" main "sukhdu:khaswabhaavon ras:" siddhanth ko prastut kar diya tha
 In the rhetorical rasas, sringar, valor, humor, wonderful and quiet, and in sadistic karuna, raudra, bebhatas and terrible were counted
 "pankaras" kaa udhaaharan dekar jaise yah siddh kiya gaya ki gud mirich aadi ko mishrit karke banaae janevaale panak ras main alag-alag vastuon kaa khatta meethaapan na maaloom hokar ek vicitra prakaar kaa aswaad miltaa he, usee prakaar yah bhi kaha gaya ki us vaichitrya main bhi anupatik dhang se kabhi khatta, kabhi tikt or isi prakaar anya prakaar kaa swaad aa hi jaataa he
 Madhusudan Saraswati's statement is that even after considering sattva as prime, rather than raja or tam, it should be accepted that partly they also remain tasteful
 acharya shukla kaa mat he ki hamen anubhuti to varnit bhav kii hi hoti he or bhav sukhaatmak du:khaatmak aadi prakaar ke hai, atev ras bhi donon prakaar kaa hoga
 On the other hand, to treat the juices as blissful, consider it to be a pity for the biased gentlemen and take the support of the argument that even if the sorrowful object is dear, it seems to be pleasurable
 jaise, ratikeli ke samay stri kaa nakhkshatadi se yon to sharir pidaa hi anubhav hoti he, kintu us samay vah use sukh hi maanati he
 In addition to this notion of Bhoja and Vishwanath, Madhusudan Saraswati himself supports his blissfulness by considering the rasas as distinct and unique from the sensation of cosmic emotions, and Abhinavagupta explains this notion that we experience the same feeling without being distracted and If it is done without external or intrinsic interference, then it is called joyful because it is tolerable
 yadi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi kyon na mana jaae? is prakaar ke anek tark dekar rason kii aanandarupata siddh kii jaati he
 The pleasure of trajedi in English has also been resolved in many ways and Marathi writers have also presented quite different perceptions regarding the beauty of juices
 praaia: rason ke vibhinn naamon kii oupaadhik yaa aupchaarik satta maanakar parmaarthik rup main ras ko ek hi maanane kii dharna prachlit rahi he
 Bharata has used the word "rasa" in a line in the line "na Hhi Rasadruta Kashchidapyartha: Pravartat" and Abhinavagupta has expressed the above notion
 bhoj ne shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar uski sarvathaev bhinn vyakhya kii he, vishwanath kii anusaar narayan pandit chamatkaarakari adbhut ko hi ekmaatr ras maanate hai, kyonki chamatkaar hi rasaroop hota he
 Bhavabhuti considers Karun to be the only rasa and explains the origin of all from him, and on the basis of the statement of "swayam swayam nimittamasadya shantadbhava: enlightenment, re-creation of peace," - calm can be considered as the only juice
 isi prakaar utsaah tathaa vismay kii sarvarasasanchari sthiti ke aadhaar par unhen bhi anya sab rason ke mul main mana ja saktaa he
 Rasa is just a monolithic feeling in the form of taste and pleasure, it is one side and other juices have emerged from the same rasa, it is the other side
 rasapraadhanya ke vichaar main rasarajata kii samasya utpann kii he
 Bharata considers all Shuchi, Ujwal, Medhya and Dalani as adorners, "agnipuran" considers the dressing as the only rasa and distinguishes it from others, Bhoja considers the Shringar as the original and only rasa, but on the basis of the available written evidence " The use of the word "rasaraja" appears only for Bhaktiras in "ujjwalanilamani"
 hindi main keshavadas shringaar ko rasanayak or dev kavi sab rason kaa mul maanate hai
 The use of the noun "rasaraja" is used only by Matiram
 duusari ore banarsidas "samaysar" naatak main "navamon saant rasni ko nayak" kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Acceptance of rajrajata is dependent on comprehensiveness, fervent taste, ability to penetrate other juices, the power to embody all sancharis and satvikas
 ye sabhi baaten jitani adhik or prabal shringaar main pai jaati hai, utani anya rason main nahin
 Therefore, Rasraj is called the same
 raso kaa raja shringaar ras ko mana jaataa he Thinkers have also described the remaining rasas except for Raudra and Karun
 inamen sabase vistrut varnan shringaar kaa hi thahartaa he
 Shringar is mainly divided into two parts in the name of conjugation and vipralambha or disconnection, but some scholars like Dhananjaya etc
 consider the antecedent distinction of Vipralambha as a coincidence-antagonistic-non-preceding condition and the two distinctions from the name of the rest of abuse and intercourse
 And do
 sanyog kii anek paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par use aganeya maanakar use keval aashray bhed se nayakaarabdh, nayikaarabdh athwa ubhayaarabdh, prakaashan ke vichaar se prachhann tathaa prakaash yaa spasht or gupt tathaa prakashanprakaar ke vichaar se sankshipt, sankeern, sampannatar tathaa samrudhimaan naamak bhed kiye jate hai tathaa vipralambh ke purvanurag yaa abhilashahetuk, maan yaa ishryahetuk, pravaas, virah tathaa karun prilambh naamak bhed kiye gaye hai
 The antithesis of "poetry poetry" is new and the shapahutak distinction can only be accepted as a form of migration, "sahityadarpan" envisages the Karuna Vipralambha
 purvanurag kaaran kii drushti se gunshravan, pratyakshdarshan, chitradarshan, swapn tathaa indrajaal-darshan-janya evam raag sthirataa or chamak ke aadhaar par neeli, kusumbh tathaa manjistha naamak bhedon main baanta jaataa he
 In "alankarakoustubh", the soon-to-be-destroyed and not-so-beautiful raga is called the fourth by the name "haridra", which his commentator also calls "shyamarag"
 purvanurag kaa dash kaamadshaayen - abhilash, chintaa, anusmriti, gunakirthan, udvaig, vilaap, vyaadhi, jadta tathaa maran - maani gai hai, jinke sthaan par kahin apane tathaa kahin duusare ke mat ke rup main vishnudharmotarpurana, dasharupak kii avlok tikaa, sahityadarpan, prataparudriya tathaa saraswatikanthabharan tathaa kavyadarpan main kinchit parivartan ke saath chakshupriti, man:sang, samaran, nidrabhang, tanuta, vyavriti, lajjanaash, unmaad, muchrcha tathaa maran kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 By adding Sharadatanaya, desire and yearning, and Vidyanatha, his number is considered 12 by bringing resolution in place of remembrance and increasing delirium and beauty
 yah yuktiyukt nahin he or inkaa antarbhaav ho saktaa he
 There are two types in the name of mana-vipralambha pranay and jealousy and three types in the name of small, medium and guru, in consideration of stability of mana and severity of crime, three types in the name of vivaripalambha karyaja, shapaj, sambhramaja and the popularization of work or The future Gachpatravas or present and Gatpravas or the future Gachpatravas or the present and the Gatpravas or the Gharpravas, the tadrupas and forms of Shapaj, and a variety of reasons Nbramj of violence, weather, divine, man, and Prckradi distinction is
 virah gurujanadi kii sameeptha ke kaaran paas rahakar bhi nayika tathaa nayak ke sanyog ke hone kaa tathaa karun vipralambh mrityu ke ananthar bhi punerjeevan dwaara milan kii aashaa bani rahanevaale viyog ko kehete hai
 Nayikalankar, Ritu and Prakriti are also described under Shringar Rasa
 ek udhaaharan he- Similarly, the example of Shringar Rasa divided into two parts by the name of Sanyog and Vipralambha or Vioga- hasyaras ke vibhavbhed se aatmasth tathaa parastha evam hasya ke vikasvichaar se smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, apasit tathaa atihasit bhed karke unke bhi uttam, madhyam tathaa adham prakruti bhed se teen bhed karte hue unke antargat purvokt kramash: do-do bhedon ko rakhaa gaya he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas and a few other writers have made only four distinctions namely Mandhas, Kalhas, Atihas and Parihas angreji ke aadhaar par hasya ke anya anek naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai
 Examples - nayaa udhaaharan- There is no difference of quiet
 keval rudrabhatt ne avashya vairaygy, doshanigrah, santosh tathaa tatvasaakshaatkaar naam se iske chaar bhed die hai jo saadhan maatr ke naam he or inaki sankhya badhaai bhi ja sakati he
 Examples - bharatmuni ke ‘naatyashaastra’ main pratipaadit aath natyarason main shringaar or hasya ke anantar tathaa raudra se purv karun ras kii gananaa kii gai 
 'raudratu Karuno Rasa:' Saying 'karun Rasa' has its origin from 'raudra Rasa' and its origin is Shapajyaan Clash Vinipat, ishitjan-viprayag, Vibhava Nash, Slaughter, Bandhan, Vidarva means Exodus, Abuse, Addiction ie Objection etc
 Is accepted by chance
 saath hi nirved, glani, chintaa, autsukya, aaveg, moh, shram, bhay, vishaad, dainya, vyaadhi, jadta, unmaad, apsmaar, traas, aalasy, maran, stambh, vepathu, vevarnya, ashru, swarbhed aadi kii vyabhichaari yaa sanchari bhav ke rup main pariganit kiya he
 Examples - kavyagat rason main raudra ras kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Bharata has considered these four rasas as 'shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatas in the Natyasastra', so he has given the origin of other juices from them, namely- 'teshamutpattihetavchchatvaro Rasa: Shringaro Roudro Viro Vibhats Iti'
 raudra se karun ras kii utpatti bataate hue bharat kehete hai ki ‘raudrasyaev c yatkarm sa shey: karuno ras:’
 The deeds of raudra rasa are the father of compassion
 raudra ras kaa 'sthaayee bhav' 'krodh' he tathaa iskaa varna rakt evam devtaa rudra he
 The example of raudra rasa has already been inscribed from Keshavdas's 'ramachandrika'
 bhushan kii rachanaaon main bhi raudra ras ke udhaaharan mil jate hai
 In the present day, the compositions of Shyamnarayan Pandey and 'dinkar' have had an effective expression of raudra rasa
 sanskrit ke granthon main ‘mahabharat’ tathaa ‘vircharit’, ‘venisanhaar’ ityadi naatakon main raudra ras kii prabhoot abhivyakti hui he
 Examples - shringaar, raudra tathaa vibhats ke saath viraras ko bhi bharat muni ne mul rason main pariganit kiya he
 The origin of the amazing juice has been revealed from Veer Ras
 vir ras kaa 'varna' 'swarna' athwa 'gaur' tathaa devtaa indra kahe gayi hai
 It is associated with good nature and its abiding spirit is 'enthusiasm'
 vir ras ke keval yudhvir, dharmaveer, dayavir tathaa daanveer bhed sweekaar kiye jate hai
 Panditraj etc
 has made many other distinctions as the basis of enthusiasm
 udhaaharan - Bharatamuni of wonderful rasa has made two distinctions - Divya and Anandaj
 vaishnav acharya iske drusht, shrut, sankirtit tathaa anumit naamak bhed karte hai
 According to Bibhats Bharata and Dhananjaya, there are three types of pure, decaying and udvegi
 bhayanak karanbhed se vyajjanya yaa bhramajanit, aparaadhjanya yaa kaalpanik tathaa vitrasitak yaa vaastavik naam se teen prakaar kaa or swanishtha paranishth bhed se do prakaar kaa mana jaataa he
 On the basis of the similarity of a particular symptom of the permanence or of some sense of the juices, the tendency of the juices to enter into each other, to reject a permanence, to be considered as new permanent has also been shown occasionally
 yatha, shant ras or dayavir tathaa vibhats main se dayavir kaa shant main antarbhaav tathaa bibhats sthaayee jugupsa ko shant kaa sthaayee mana gaya he
 "nagananda" considers the play to be a play of calm and a play on mercy by Dayavir
 kintu yadi shant ke tatvagyanamoolak viraam or dayavir ke karunajanit utsaah par dhyaan diya jaae to donon main bhinnata dikhaai degi
 Similarly, the distraction in Jugupsa does not remain in the quiet
 shant raag-dwesh donon se pare samavastha or tatvagyansanmilit ras he jisamen jugupsa sanchari maatr ban sakati he
 Just like in Karun, there is a sense of sympathy and in Dayavir, but in Karun, there is a state of mourning and in Dayavir, there is a sympathetic self-proclaimed enthusiasm
 athwa, jaise raudra or yudhvir donon kaa alamban shatru he, at: donon main krodh kii maatra rahati he, parantu raudra main rahanevaali pramodpratikul tikshnata or avivek or yudhvir main utsah kii utfullata or vivek rahata he
 In anger, there is a sense of vengeance in hostility and in valor patience and generosity
 atev inkaa paraspar antarbhaav sambhav nahin
 Similarly, it is also not appropriate to consider "anmarsha" as permanent of Veer, because Amarsha manifests as Abhinivesh or self-respecting sense of mind due to condemnation, insult or objection, but in this kind of distinctions of Veeras called Dayavir, Danavir, and Dharmaveer The feeling does not last

 Nagar Brahmin History - Skandpuran is the oldest book in which mention is made about the origin of the Naga Brahmins, it is believed that Skanda Purana is the text which was written between 300-700 AD by King Skandagupta and Vallabhi rulers of the Brahmin religion against Buddha religion
 It was written by various historians and writers for assessment

, of a legend According to a Brahmin's son Krutha once roamed and reached Nagtirtha of Nagaloka
 There he was confronted with Rudal, the prince of Nag Lok, in which Nag Kumar was killed
 This angered Nag Raj and he vowed to destroy the family who killed his son
 He climbed the village which is today known as Vadnagar, while Brahmin Kumar Kroth


 Used to live with his family and other family
 Many Brahmin families were killed in this and the survivors fled and took refuge near a sage Muni Trijat
 Trijat asked him to worship Lord Shiva
 The Brahmins did penance to Lord Shiva with full heart and devotion
 Lord Shiva was pleased but since the serpent was also a devotee of Shiva, Shiva expressed his inability to harm the serpents but gave the Brahmins the power to escape from the venom of snakes
 The Brahmins returned to their village and from then on came to be called na-gar

 The surface pressure of Mars at its thickest is equal to the pressure found 35 km above the Earth's surface
 yah prithvi ke satahi dabaav se 1% kam he 
 The scale height of the atmosphere is about 10
8 km, which is higher than on Earth because the surface gravity of Mars is only 38% above the surface gravity of Earth, this effect is offset by the average molecular weight of more than 50% of the atmosphere of Mars and This is done by low temperature

 Mars has two relatively small natural moons, Phobos and Dimose, whose orbit is closer to the planet
 kshudragrah par kabja ek zyada samarthit siddhant he lekin isaki utpatti anishchit bani hui he
 Both satellites were discovered by Asaf Hall in 1877 and were named after the characters Phobos and Dimos, who, in battle in Greek mythology, accompanied their father, the god of war, Eris
 aries rome ke logon ke liye mangal grah ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 From the surface of Mars, the movements of Phobos and Demos appear to be quite different from our own moon
 phobose pashchim main udai hota he, purv main ast hota he or maatr 11 ghante baad phir se udit hota he
 There is a slightly outward synchronous orbit of the dimose, that is, its orbital period corresponds to its rotation period, as it rises in the east but very slowly

 Since Phobos' orbit is below synchronous altitude, tidal forces from Mars are gradually shortening its orbit
 lagbhag 5 karod varsh main yah yaa to mangal kii sataha main durghatnagrast ho jayega yaa grah ke chaaron ore challe ke rup main tuutakar bikhar jayega
 The origins of both moons are not well understood, due to the low albedo and carbonized condrite structure that is thought to be similar to an asteroid, which supports the theory of grabbing
 phobose kii asthir kaksha ek apekshaakrit haal hi main hathiyaane kii pravriti kii ore ingit prathit hoti he
 But the orbits of both are circular, very close to the equator, which is very unusual for forcibly stripped bodies and also complicates the necessary acquisition dynamics

 Slang or slang are informal words and phrases of a language or dialect that are not considered standard in the speaker's language or dialect but are acceptable in colloquialisms
 bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki kathboliyaan har maanak bhashaa main hameshaa astitv main rahi hai or lagbhag sabhi log unka prayog karte hai
 Often different sections of the same language community have their own different slang and the use of slang by a person is a sign of membership in a particular class
 udhaaharan ke liye dilli ke hindi bolne vaale pulisavaale ko kathboli main 'thulla' kehete hai jabaki mumbai main use 'mamaa' kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes slang can remain prevalent for a long time without being a part of the standard language, for example in some sections of the society in the form of slang the word 'thulla' for Sho or Durga in some communities in the Punjab region in 1880 Was found to be prevalent
 kathboliyaan aksar preyokti ke rup main bhi istemaal hoti hai jab kisi chiz ke liye maanak shabd sunne main apriy yaa apmanjanak samajha jaae, masalan 'mutr' ko kai hindibhashi kathboli main 'susu' kehete hai
 Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a word is part or slang of the standard language
 bhashavaigyanik bethani dumaas or jonethan liter ne kisi shabd yaa vaakyansh ke kathboli hone ke kuch chihnon kii suchi banaai ki agar koi shabd inamen se kam-se-kam do lakshan rakhata ho to shaayad kathboli he : Slang is different from a specialist dialect spoken in a commercial field
 vargboli kisi vishesh peshey kii takneekee shabdaawalee hoti he or uske shabd upar di gai suchi main se keval duusare maandand ko puraa karte hai, isliye kathboli nahin kahe ja sakate haalanki unka prayog peshey se baahar vaale ko samooh se alag rakhane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Some slang is used only in a particular area, for example in Fijian Hindi, 'what' is sometimes called 'konchi', a contracted form of 'who cheese'
 iske vipareet kathboli sangyaayen kshetra kii bajaae aksar kisi vishesh up-samskruti jaise ki sangeet yaa video khelon se judi hoti hai
 Nevertheless, slang expressions can go beyond their realms and be generally usable like "cool" and "jive"
 jabaki kuch shabd antat kathboli ke rup main apni sthiti ko kho dete hai, anya shabdon ke prayog ko zyaadaatar vaktaaon dwaara isi tarah mana jaataa rahaa
 When slang goes beyond the group or subculture that originally used it, its actual users tend to use other, less-recognized terms to retain the identity of the group
 kathboli kaa ek upyog saamaajik nishedhon ko darkinar karnaa he kyonki mukhyadhara kii bhashaa kuch vaastaviktaaon ko tarotaaja karne se dur bhaagane kii koshish karti he
 For this reason, slang terminology is particularly rich in certain areas such as violence, crime, drugs, and sex
 vaikalpik rup se kathboli varnan kii gayi chizon ke saath keval maatr apanepan se baahar nikal sakati he
 For example, among the gifts of Californian wine, Cabernet Sauvignon is often referred to as "cab saw", cardone as "card" and so on; This means that naming individual alcohols reduces its unnecessary use; It also helps to show the user's familiarity with alcohol
 yahan tak ki ek bhashaa vaale samudaay main bhi kathboli or jis had tak iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he, yah sampurna saamaajik, jaateey, aarthik or bhugolic kshetra main vyapak rup se bhinn ho jaataa he
 Slang can be out of use after a long time; However, sometimes its use becomes more and more common until it becomes an effective way of saying something, when it is generally understood as the accepted language of the mainstream, although the case of prohibitive words There may not be any expression that is considered mainstream or acceptable language
 kathboli ke kai shabd anaupchaarik mukhyadhara ke samvaad main or kabhi-kabhi aupchaarik samvaad main pravesh kar jate hai, haalanki isse arth yaa upyog main ek badlaav bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Slang often involves the creation of novel meanings for existing words
 un aupnyasik arthon kaa maanak arth se kaaphi had tak alag ho janaa ek aam baat he
 Thus both 'cool' and 'hot' can mean "very good," "impressive," or "beautiful"
 kathboli ke shabdon ko aksar keval ek gut yaa antah samooh ke andar istemaal ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Leats for example were originally popular only among certain Internet subcultures such as crackers and online video gamers
 haalanki 1990 ke dashak ke dauraan or 21veen sadi kii shuruyaat main lit ne internet par adhik se adhik aam sthaan lenaa shuru kar diya he or ab yah internet aadhaarit samvaad or baatcheet kii bhashaaon ke baahar bhi fail gaya he
 Other types of slang include the language of SMS used on mobile phones and "chatspeak," which is a reverse meaning of "laughing loudly" or "loud laughter" or ROFL, "rolling on the ground laughing" ), Which is widely used to send instant communication over the Internet
 kuch bhashavid kathboli ke prayog or khichdi bhashaa ke prayog ke bich ek antar rakhte hai
 According to Ghilad Zuckerman "slang refers to a specific social group, for example informal textual materials used by teenagers, soldiers, prisoners, and thieves
" kathboli bolchaal kii bhashaa kii tarah nahin he jo kisi avasar par vaktaa dwaara istemaal kii jane vaali ek anaupchaarik, aasaan boli he; jisamen shabdasancoch shaamil ho sakate hai jaise ki "tumhaara" or anya bolchaal ke shabdon kaa prayog
 aam bolchaal kii bhashaa kaa prayog anaupchaarik boli main istemaal kii jane vaali ek shabdic saamagree he jabaki vyapak arthon main "bolchaal kii bhashaa" shabdaawalee main kathboli kaa prayog shaamil ho saktaa he, iske sankeern arthon main nahin
 Slang is often used in colloquial language but not all colloquial languages are slang
 kathboli or bolchaal kii bhashaa ke bich karne kaa ek tarika yah poochna he ki kya zyaadaatar sthaneey vaktaa is shabd ko samajhate hai ; agar ve aisa karte hai to yah ek bolchaal kii bhashaa he
 The problem, however, is that it is not a separate, quantization system but a continuum system
 haalanki zyaadaatar kathboliyaan alpakaalik hoti hai or aksar nae logon dwaara prayog kii jaati hai jinamein se kuch gaiyr-kathboli vaali bolchaal kii bhashaa kii sthiti hasil kar leti hai 'anand, bhagya' or ek yahudee mahila kaa pehla naam, zelda) or yahan tak ki ek aupchaarik sthiti "
 Slang is called 'slang' in many languages
 The roots of this word are not yet known to linguists
 iskaa sambandh choron kii kubhasha se he or iskaa sabase pehla pramanik prayog "nimna yaa gaiyr-pratishthit logon kii shabdaawalee se he, haalanki iske alaava iskaa mul spasht nahin he
