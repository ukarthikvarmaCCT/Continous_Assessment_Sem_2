 The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them was the ubiquitous ether
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory
 ye teen fal is prakaar hai: a medicine is a substance whose definite amount shows a certain type of effect in the body
 inkaa prayojan chikitsa main hota he
 For using any substance as a medicine, it is unavoidable to know the properties of that substance, the behavior according to quantity, the effect of different amounts on the body, etc
 aushadhiyaan rogon ke ilaaj main kaam aati hai
 Initially, medicines were obtained from plants, animals and animals according to Ayurveda, but as the chemistry expanded, new ingredients were discovered and new drugs were prepared from them by artificial method
 ye ve aushadhiyaan hai jo merudand or mastishk ko prabhavit karti hai
 They are used in the treatment of nervous and mental diseases
 udhaaharan ke liye anti-apileptic aushadhiyaan mashtishk ke atiuttejit kshetron kii gatividhiyon ko kam karke mirgee ke dauron ko samaapt kar detii hai
 Anti-psychotic drugs are used in the treatment of mental diseases like schizophrenia
 anti-depressent aushadhiyaan maansik avsaad kii sthiti ko samaapt karti hai
 These drugs prevent some cancers or their rapid growth and spread
 ye aushadhiyaan sabhi canceron ke liye kargar nahin hoti hai
 There are different medicines for cancers of the gallbladder, brain, liver or bone etc
 ye aushadhiyaan kuch vishesh tantuon athwa angon ke liye vishishtï hoti hai
 Anti-cancer drugs perform their function by interfering with specific cancer cells

 iske antargat prithvi sambandhi anekanek vishay aa jate hai jaise, khanij shaastra, talachat vigyaan, bhoomapan or khanan ejiniyari ityadi
 One of the main topics of its study is a discussion of the actions that have been taking place in the geology since time immemorial and as a result of which the form of the earth is constantly changing, although its speed is generally very slow
 anya prakarnon main prithvi kii aayu, bhugarbha, jwalamukhi kriya, bhusanchalan, bukamp or parvatanirmaan, mahadeshiy visthaapan, bhoumikeey kaal main jalwaayu parivartan tathaa him yug vishesh ullekhneey hai
 Geology discusses the origin of the Earth, its structure and its composition and its history expressed by rocks
 yah vigyaan un prakramon par bhi prakaash daalata he jinase shailon main parivartan aate rahete hai
 This includes the relationship of prehistoric organisms with innovative organisms and the study of their origin and development
 iske antargat prithvi ke sanghatak padaarthon, un par kriyasheel shaktiyon tathaa unase utpann sanrachanaon, bhupatal kii shailon ke vitaran, prithvi ke itihaas aadi ke adhyayan ko sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Geology provides insights into the history of the Earth
 khanijon tathaa hydrocarbonon kii khoj ke falswaroop vartmaan yug main iskaa vanijyik mahatv bahut adhik bad gaya he
 Similarly, it also has importance in the assessment of aquatic resources
 prakritik vipadaaon ko samajhane evam unki bhavishyavaanee karne ke kaaran yah aam janata ke liye bhi mahatv rakhata he
 It can suggest solutions to environmental problems and gives insight into past climate changes
 bhootkneekee ejiniyari main isaki bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 There are several subdivisions of this science, of which the following are the most important - Historical Geology, Physical Geology, Economic Geology, Structural Geology, Mineralogy, Mining Geology, Geomorphology, Shell Color, Shell Science, Volcanology, Level Geology and Paleontology
 
 bhuvigyaan ko do pramukh virgon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he: Physical geology includes mineralogy, soil science, structural geology and geomorphology
 aitihaasik bhuvigyaan main starit shailavigyaan, jeevashm vigyaan tathaa purabhugol ko sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays, geology is divided into the following two branches - bhuprushthiya parivartanon ke adhyayan ko bahudhaa gatikeey bhuvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 It is clear that this name refers to the dynamic state of the dorsal environment, but nowadays the name is not anything special and physical geology is more prevalent in its place
 is vigyaan ke teen mukhya ang hote hai, jo is prakaar hai : Physics · Biology · Chemistry · Biochemistry · Mathematics · Biotechnology · Astrology · Microbiology tendua panthra jinas kaa ek vidal he jo africa or asia main paaya jaataa he
 It is the smallest as compared to Vidal species such as lion, tiger and jaguar
 tendue adhikanshtah pili chamadi ke hote hai jisapar gahare rang ke dhabbe hote hai
 But there can be many differences between the different sub-species of tendu
 kuch tendue purna rup se kaale bhi hote hai, or unhen kaala panther kaha jaataa he
 Male tendons are about 30% larger than female tendons
 tendue mul rup se puure africa or dakshin asia main rahete aae hai
 But now many sub-species of tendons, especially in Asia, are on the verge of extinction
 anya badi billiyon kii tulana main tendue sabase bade kshetron main rahete hai or is kaaran inaki bahut si upaprajatiyaan pai jaati hai
 The tendu live in different environments such as: rainforest, forests, mountains and savannas

 India Gate is a huge 43 meter high gate located on the Rajpath of New Delhi
 yah swatantra bharat kaa rashtriya smarak he, jise purv main kingsve kaha jaataa tha
 It was designed by Sir Edward Lutyens
 yah smarak paris ke arq de troym se prerit he
 It was built in 1931

 The names of 13,300 soldiers, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are engraved on the gate
 laal or pile balua pattharon se bana hua yah smarak darshneey he
 When India Gate was ready, a statue of George v was placed in front of it
 jise baad main british raaj ke samay kii anya murtiyon ke saath coronaton park main sthapit kar diya gaya
 Now, instead of the statue of George V, only one umbrella is left as a symbol

 The Amar Jawan Jyoti has been installed under its arch

 Until the 1920s, Old Delhi Railway Station used to be the only railway station in the entire city

 Many important routes pass through the 42 meter high India Gate
 pehle india get ke aasapaas hokar kaaphi yatayaat gujarata tha
 But now it has been closed for heavy vehicles

 satyarth prakaash kii rachana arya samaaj ke sansthaapak maharishi dayanand saraswati ne kii
 Although his mother tongue was Gujarati and had so much knowledge of Sanskrit that he spoke fluently in Sanskrit, he composed this book in Hindi
 kehete hai ki jab swami ji 1872 main kalakatta main keshavachandra sen se mili to unhone swami ji ko yah salaah di ki aap sanskrit chhodkar hindi bolnaa armbh kar den to bharat kaa aseem kalyaan ho
 Since then, the language of Swami ji's lectures became Hindi and perhaps for this reason Swamiji also kept the language of Satyarth Prakash as Hindi
 swami ji puure desh main gum-ghumkar shastrarth evam vyaakhyaan kar rahe the
 With this, his followers requested that if these texts and lectures were written down, they would become immortal
 satyarth prakaash kii rachana unke anuyaayiyon ke is anurodh ke kaaran hi sambhav hui
 The main objective of the creation of Satyarth Prakash was to propagate the principles of Arya Samaj
 iske saath-saath isamen isai, islam evam anya kai panthon va maton kaa khandan bhi he
 At that time a conspiracy was also going on to discredit Hindu religion and culture by removing the misinterpretation of Hindu scriptures
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar maharishi dayanand ne iskaa naam satyarth prakaash arthath sahi arth par prakaash daalane vaala rakhaa
 The main purpose of this creation of social reformer Swami Dayanand Saraswati is to render truth to truth and false to false
 yadhyapi hindu jivan vyakti or samaaj, donon ko samaksh rakhkar chalata he, to bhi hinduon main praaia: dekha jaataa he ki samashtivaadee kii apeksha vyaktivaadee pravriti adhik he
 If a person belonging to this society has been yearning near the worshiper absorbed in meditation, then he will consider it to be the reason for meditation
 yah kadaapi nahin ki vah bhi usee samaaj kaa ek ang he
 Then in the nineteenth century, the British civilization had a great influence
 angreji prachaar ke parinamswaroop hindu hi apni samskruti ko hey maanane or pashchim kaa andhanukaran karne main garv samajhane lage the
 According to Macaulay's plan to corrupt Indians with Indianness, the emphasis was on the English education system to degenerate Hindus
 videshi sarkaar tathaa angreji samaaj apane agent padariyon ke dwaara isiyat kaa jhandaa desh ke ek kone se duusare kone tak fahraane ke liye karodon rupee kharch kar rahe the
 Hindus had lost their religious and national pride
 144 hindu prati din musalmaan ban rahe the or isai to isse kahin adhik
 Pastor Rangeela was distributing hundreds of dirty pamphlets like Krishna and Sita Ka Chhinala
 in niraadhaar laanchhanon kaa uttar dene ke bajaay brahm samaaj waalon ne ulate rashtriyata kaa hi virodh kiya
 Far from honoring the Vedas etc
, a lot of belly blasphemed them
 swami dayanand ne arya samaaj or satyarth prakaash ke dwaara in ghaatak pravritiyon ko roka
 He even wrote - "you should be a minister born in self-rule
 paramatma hamaara raja he
 He should please make us official
 " iske saath hi unhone arya sabhyataa evam samskruti se prakhar prem or veda, upanishad aadi arya satsahitya tathaa bharat kii paramparaon ke prati shraddha par bal diya
 Due to arousing devotion towards self-society, self-religion, self-language and self-nation, and doing logical things, the educated Hindus of North India gradually started pulling here, which made the Arya Samaj popular in social and educational fields
 satyarth prakaash main chaudaa samullas hai
 These topics have been considered in it - child education, study-teaching, marriage and homemaker, vanaprastha, sannyasa-rajdharma, God, creation-origin, bondage-salvation, ethics-incest, Arya-vaadist Mataramantar, Christianity and Islam
 isaki bhashaa ke sambandh main dayanand ji ne san 1882 main is granth ke duusare sanskaran main swayan yah likhaa - "jis samay maine yah granth banaaya tha, us samay
sanskrit bhaashan karne or janmabhumi kii bhashaa gujarati hone ke kaaran mujhako is bhashaa kaa vishesh parigyaan na tha
 This made the language impure
 ab isko bhashaa-vyakaran-anusaar shuddh karke duusari baar chhapavaya he
 " iske mukhya sandesh paaramparik hindu reeti se alag or kahin-kahin viruddh bhi hai
 These are as follows - jaisaa ki spasht hoga, swami dayanand kaa mat kai vishwaason or maton kaa khandan or vedon ke mat ko punahprakash main laane kaa tha
 So many times he had to refute the beliefs of prevailing Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, Islamic and Christian beliefs
 avatharavaad, shankaracharya ko shiv kaa avatar, ram or krishna ko vishnu naamak saarvbhaum kaa avatar maanane vaale kai the
 In the same way, he refuted the systems like pilgrimage, child marriage and birth-related caste
 isse kai sudhaar hindu samaaj main aae
 Many faiths also changed Islamic society

 yah bharat main oriya bhashaa ke tivi channelon kii suchi he:- Shunhashep is a legend located in Aitareya Brahmin
 iskaa saransh yah he ki jab tak mrityu saamne na aaye tab tak roopaantaran nahin hota
 This narrative is a tale of human greed, dishonesty and the ability to rise above it
 raja harishchandra apni sau raniyon ke baavjood nissantan tha
 He worshiped the God of Varuna, that if i have a son, i will dedicate the first son to you
 use ek putr kii prapti ho gai, jiskaa naam rohit rakhaa gaya
 But as soon as the king saw the son in a hurry, his intentions were damaged
 vah kisi na kisi bahaane rohit ko varun devtaa ko saunpane kii baat taalata rahaa
 Fearing that the father would not actually offer him to Varun Dev, Rohit ran into the forest and Harishchandra did not fulfill his vow, so Varun cursed him and became ill
 bhagyavash jangal main idhar-udhar ghoomte rohit ko ajigart naamak stri ek garib brahman ke paas le ai
 Rohit told his story to him
 ajigart ke teen bete the - shun:puchh, shun:langool or shun:shape
 Shun: Shep was a middle son and was very intelligent and intelligent since childhood
 ajigart ne laalach main aakar rohit se kaha ki sau gaayon ke badale vah apane ek putr ko bechney ko taiyaar he
 He can save his life by handing over that son to the god Varuna instead
 duusari ore shun:shape ne sochaa, chota bhai maa kaa laadla he, bada bhai pita kaa laadla he, yadi main chalaa jaaun to donon main se kisi ko koi afsos nahin hoga
 So he agreed to go with Rohit himself
 varun dev bhi koi kam lobhi nahin the
 They were happy to think that i am getting a Brahmin boy for my ritual instead of a Kshatriya boy who is superior
 yajna main nar bali kii taiyaari shuru hui, chaar purohiton ko bulaayaa gaya
 Now Shun: Shep had to be tied to the sacrificial pillar
 lekin iske liye un chaaron main se koi taiyaar nahin hua, kyonki shun:shape brahman tha
 Then in exchange for Azigart and hundred cows, he agreed to tie his child to the Yajna pillar
 iske baad shun:shape ko bali dene kii baari ai
 But the priests again refused
 brahman kii hatya koun kare? tab ajigart or ek sau gaayon ke badale apane bete ko kaatane ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gaya
 When Shun: Shep saw that there was no one to save me now, he started the eulogy of Usha Devta
 prayek richa ke saath shun:shape kaa ek-ek bandhan tuutata gaya or antim richa ke saath na keval shun:shape mukt ho gaya, balki raja harishchand bhi shraap mukt ho gaye
 With this, the child became Shun: Shep, the sage Shun: Shape, because it was a moment of transformation for him
 kuch or vidwano ke anusaar shun:shape kushiko ke kul me utapann mahaan tapasvi vishwamitra va vishwamitra ke shatru sambar kii putree ugr kii khoi huyi santaan tha jise bharto ke dar se lopamudra ne ajitgart ke paas chipa diya tha
 Bharato kills Furious
 bhartiya samskruti main paidaa hue kisi bhi manushya kaa man yavat jivan trividh eshnaon se baddh – subaddh – rahata he
 This is an undeniable reality
 ye teen eshnaon kaa naam he – 1
 putraishna, 2
 vittaishna or 3
 lokaishna
 Out of these three, the distraction is related to the practical life of man-life
 or jo lokaishna he, vah purvamimasaa-prokt yajyayagadi se praapt honevaale swarglok aadi maranottar lok se sambandh rakhti he
 But the daughter-in-law, it is the irrefutable seed of eternal and universal desire to remain forever on the earthly realm of mankind
 or aisi putraishna main putr evam putree donon abhisht he – yah baat taarkik rup se nihit he
 But due to the natural limitations of feminine, man's importance has increased in the society due to being stronger than male and female, and in the world, male dominance has been shaped
 atah manushyamaatr ke man main putraishna jadibhoot ho gai he
 Therefore, the story of Shunshashep in Aitreyabrahman becomes an extremely guide to the masses of daughters-in-law
 
 However, the story of Shunha Sheep is seen from a different perspective
 jaise ki – vedakaal main narmedh yag hote the yaa nahin
 In the Shunashekayana, when it comes to sacrificing a human being to Varunadevata, scholars around the world have made a point of discussion about whether humans were sacrificed in the Vedic yajna-yagadi along with animal sacrifice
 - parantu is aakhyaan main antatogatva koi bhi manushya kaa bali to nahin chadhaaya jaataa he
 Due to this, there is an urgent need for reconsideration
 is shunamshepakhyaan ke prarambh main raja harishchandraji ne naarad ko poocha he ki – gyani evam agyani donon prakaar ke log apane oras putr kii kaamana karte he
 So tell me why you should wish for a son? Giving a solution to this curiosity, Naradji said that the son is also a form of light in the Supreme Vyom
 duusari or, is aakhyaan ke ant main kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi raja ke rajbhishek ke prasang main yah aakhyaan kaa paath karnaa chaiye, evam jisko bhi putr kii kaamana ho in logon ko bhi is aakhyaan kaa shravan karnaa chaiye
 Keeping in view this undertaking and epilogue of Shunha Sheep story, if seen, the story of three sons and three fathers is presented in this story
 jaisaa ki – pratham pita kii baat aisi haih- ikshvakuvansh ke raja harishchandr ko so so patniyaan hote huye bhi ve aputra the
 But behind these hundred-odd marriages, there must have been betrothal as a driving force
 naarad ne putr ke hone se jo jo laabh milte he, usko vistaar se bataaya he
 Hearing him, Harishchandra begs the son from Varun Devata at any cost
 putr ek baar paidaa ho jaay or vah uskaa mukhadarshan karle to vah kritakruty ho jaayegaa
 And after that he is also ready to sacrifice the son to Varun
 harishchandr ko is shart par putr mil gaya
 From the narrative of the narrative presented here, it is known that the malevolence in the human being, it drowns the man in blind faith
 devataaon ko balidaan de kar putr praapt kiya jaataa he – aisa maananaa ek agyaan he
 On the second level, it is seen that after the attainment of son, father Harishchandra also becomes Mohandh and repeatedly stutters with the promise of sacrificing Varuna
 varunadev jab bhi bali maangane ke liye aate he tab ve ek ke baad ek bahaanaa dikhalaate huye apane putr kii bali dene kaa taalte rahete hai
 The second father is Azigart, son of Suyyavas
 vah bechaara bhukh se peedit he
 He also has a wife and three sons as dependents
 bhukh ke asaadhaaran evam aprihaary sankat main funs kar bhi vah apane kisi bhi putr ko bajhaar main bech de vah uchit nahin he
 Therefore, if he beaks himself as the family of the family, then he will be considered right
 parantu “ sabhi ko apni hi aatma sab se adhik priy hoti he ”- is krur satya ko dhyaan main liya jaay or phir sochaa jaay to shaayad teen main se ek putr ko bech dene kii baat kadachit sahya ban sakegi
 In the same way, the age-old weakness of the parents is also of Kubul that the father is loved by the eldest son and the mother is loved by the junior
 to bechaara ‘ tapasvi ’ madhyamputra aisi visham paristhiti main nishchit hi bali kaa bakra ban jaataa he
 In this way, the aggrieved father, Azigart, by taking cows from King Harishchandra, and selling a son in exchange for him, might - yes, perhaps - be reluctantly judged judicial
 kintu vahi pita apane putr ko yagyeey pashu ke rup main, harishchandr kii yajyashala main baandhane ko taiyaar ho jaay or aise adham krity ke liye duusari so gaayen maang le to vah lobhivriti kaa parinaam hi kaha jaayegaa
 Narrator Mahidas Aitareya has also described the climax of greed
 yup ke saath putr shunagashep ko baandhane ke baad pita ajigart apane paapakarm se virat nahin hota he
 Yajna will not be complete unless one slaughter in the sacrifice as a sacrifice
 gaanv main se koi bhi chandal aakar ek manushya kaa vadh karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 So Shunshape's father Azigart Lobhavashat is ready for this sin
 usne teesri so gaayon ko maang kar le lee
 And ruthlessly rises with a drawn sword to kill his own son
 - yah chitra ek laalchee pita kii nirghrinata ko udghaatit karata he
 In philosophies which have been counted as Shad Ripu - Kama, Krodh, Mad, Moh, Greed and Matsar - successive Ripu among them is considered to be strong
 arthath pahele kamadi chaar ripuon se paanchava lobh naamak ripu adhik balvan he
 From this point of view, the second type of father has not only disturbed the patriarchy by being tempted
 parantu maanavmaryada kaa bhi atikaraman karke paapmarg par sudur tak nikal gaya he
 The third father is the sage Vishwamitra, who had one son each
 unke hotrutv main shunagashep kaa yajna main bali dena nishchit hua tha
 He has seen Shunha Shape as a sacrificial animal, tied in a pathetic condition before him
 unki dayaneey manoyatnaa evam nihsahaayta bhi pratipal dekhi he
 And in a critical situation, patiently following the path of worship of the gods, trying to get rid of the death loop by becoming their own savior, they have observed closely
 prajapati, agni, savita, varun, vishwedeva, asvins, indra or ushaa – sabhi vaidic devataaon ko shunagashep apane mantrabal se kramshah pratyaksh karata jaataa he
 Also talks to them
 aisa sachcha vidyavan brahmanputra kis rishi ko pasand nahin aayegaa ? Rishi Vishwamitra considered such Shunsha Shep to be his inheritance - knowledge
 And in his heart Mana Shunhashep accepted him as his son
 vishwamitra ek pita ke rup main gungnata vyakti the
 He called his first fifty sons and asked Shunha Shep to accept him as the first brother-in-law
 parantu un putron ne pitru-ajna nahin maani
 Therefore, Vishwamitra declared those fifty to be 'ineligible'
 ve rishi-sampatti ke daay bhaag se vanchit ho gayi
 After this, who was the twenty-first son named Madhuchanda and all his followers, he considered Shun Shashep as his eldest brother
 phir vishwamitra rishi ne shunagashep ko “ devraat ” namase uddhoshit kiya
 People with sonship should want to become virtuous fathers like Pehle Vishwamitra
 vishwamitra ne apane shatadhik putron kii apeksha se shreshth putr ke rup main is mantradrashtaa shunagashep ko hi pasand kiya he or usko apane putr ke rup main bhi sweekaar liya he – yah baat bady suchak he
 If such a son was found, then only what Narada had said that - "son, there is light in the Supreme Vyom," - that can be a matter, otherwise not
 is aakhyaan main raja harishchandr, daridr ajigart evam rishi vishwamitra jaise teen pitaaon kii tulana kerani aavashyak banati he, vaise hi teen prakaar ke putron kii bhi tulana karne yogya he
 As - Rohit, the son of King Harishchandra is the first
 vah apane pita ke prastaav kaa virodh karata he or pitru-ajna ko thukraa kar, praanon kii raksha karne ke liye grihatyag karke van main vicharan karne lagata he
 After this, the father has a disease called ascites - after hearing this, inspired by the patriarchy, he decides to return home
 parantu maarg main indradev mil gayi, uske kehane main aa jaataa he or vah baar baar dusron ke kehane main aakar van main waapas laut jaataa he
 The result of Indra's preaching with these words is that Harishchandra's son Rohit has found three poor sons, Azigart, a wandering father in search of food, along with one of the three sons
 rohit ne raajputr hone ke kaaran, rajalakshmi ke jor par, arthath baap-kamai ke jor par, daridr vyakti ke ek deen-hin putr ko kharid kar apane saath main le kar rajmahal main waapas aata he
 Prince Rohit has kept in mind that by sacrificing this poor-brahmanaputra, he will free the father from Varuna's loop and he will also get rid of himself
 - yahan par indra ke kahene main aakar baar baar van-vicharan karte rahete rohit kaa, pahele ek anirnaayak manobalavaale putr ke rup main parichay miltaa he or baad main, swaarthee tathaa baap-kamai kaa ashrayan lenevaale raajputr ke rup main parichay miltaa he
 In the world, this is the first type of son
 
 The second type of son in the world is the 50 sons of sage Vishwamitra
 ve vishwamitra jaise mantradrashtaa pita kii bhi ajna maanate nahin he
 These sons, disregarding the wisdom of the father, lost their paternal heritage and were also cursed
 parinamtah ve samaaj main dasyuon jaisaa jivan jeene lagate he
 The son of twenty-one Madhuchanda and his 50 brothers-in-law obeyed the father
 vishwamitra kii drushti main vishwaas karanevaale in putron ne shunagashep ko apane jyeshtha bhrata ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 
 tisare prakaar kaa jo putr sadaiv spruhaniya hota he, vah he shunagashep
 After reading the entire narrative, it seems that he was an aphrodisiac, but was a son of continuous learning
 kyonki varun ke pash se mukt hone ke liye jo mantra rugveda ke chaturth mandal or pancham mandal main aaye huye he in sab ko vah acchhee tarah se jaanata tha
 Along with that, he himself is also the seer of many mantras stored in the First Circle
 at ev vah rishi vishwamitra kii drushti main spruhaniya putr ban jaataa he
 Vishwamitra had 101 and sons of his own
 kintu unako shunagashep jaisaa mantra-drashtaa putr na hone kaa afsos tha
 Therefore, he summons his auspices and orders Shunashape to accept him as the eldest brother
 unki drushti main shunagashep jaisaa putr hi sangrahya evam spruhaniya he
 Vishwamitra has seen during the entire yagya kriya that Shunha Shape is a devrat in the true sense
 agni, varun, indra, asvins, vishwedeva evam ushaa ityadi devataayen hi unki sampatti – raati – the or usee ke bal upar usne apni mukti haansil kii he
 Here, because of Shunahshep learning - Vyasangi knows so much mantra or can see new mantra - it is not enough to say that
 usne to apane pita kaa paap bhi unke munh par kah diya he
 That is, Shunahshep can also see the truth, and by standing in front of the father, he can also tell
 vahi uski mahanata he
 The person speaking such truth frees Varuna from the loop and not the other
 kyonki varun to neetimatta kaa evam rut kaa paalak dev kaha gaya he
 Therefore, he frees Satyaniti's seer Shaunshape from bondage
 aisa satyavaktaa putr hi pitaaon ke liye param vyom main jyoti swaroop ban saktaa he
 And only such a son should be wished for

 Work in physics is considered when applying some force on an object displaces something in the direction of the force
 duusare shabdon main, koi bal lagane se bal kii disha main vastu kaa visthaapan ho to kehete hai ki bal ne kaary kiya
 Work is one of the most important quantities in physics

 loktantr yaa prajatantr ek aisi shashan vyav vyavastha or loktantric rajya donon ke liye prayukt hota he
 Although the term democracy is used in a political context, the principle of democracy is also relevant for other groups and organizations
 multah loktantr bhinn bhinn siddhanton ke mishran se banate hai, par matdaan ko loktantr ke adhikansh prakaaron kaa charitragat lakshan mana jaataa he
 According to the definition of democracy it is "rule by the people, by the people, by the people"
 lekin alag-alag deshkal or paristhitiyon main alag-alag dharanaon ke prayog se isaki avadharana kuch jatil ho gayi he
 Many proposals have been made in the context of democracy since ancient times, but many of them were never implemented
 pratinidhi loktantr main janata sarkari adhikariyon ko sidhe chunati he
 Representatives are elected from a district or parliamentary constituency or represent all voters in several proportional arrangements
 kuch deshon main mishrit vyavastha prayukt hoti he
 Although representatives in such a democracy are elected by the people, the representatives themselves decide the policies to act in the public interest
 yadhyapi dalgat nitiyaan, matadaataaon main chhavi, punah chunaav jaise kuch kaarak pratinidhiyon par asar daalate hai, kintu saamanytah inamen se kuch hi badhyakaari anudesh hote hai
 The greatest feature of this system is that the mandate pressure acts to curb policy deviations, as elections are mandatory for the legitimacy of power at regular intervals
 ek tarah kaa pratinidhi loktantr he, jisamen svachh or nishpaksh chunaav hote hai
 Characteristic features of liberal democracy include security of minorities, law and order, distribution of powers, etc
 Freedom of expression, language, assembly, religion and property are prominent
 pratyaksh loktantr main sabhi naagarik saare mahatvapurn nitigat faislon par matdaan karte hai
 It is called direct because in principle it has no representative or mediator
 sabhi pratyaksh loktantr chote samudaay yaa nagar-rashtron main hai
 Example - Switzerland pracheen kaal me bharat main sudrudh vyavastha vidyaman thi
 We find evidence of this from ancient literature, coins and inscriptions
 videshi yatriyon evam vidwaanon ke varnan main bhi is baat ke pramaan hai
 The electoral system for the ruler and other officials of government was the same as in the ancient republican system

 Not all citizens had the right to vote
 rugveda tathaa kautilya sahitya ne chunaav paddati kii pushti kii he parantu unhone vot dene ke adhikaar par roshni nahin daali he
 Like the present Parliament, councils were formed in ancient times which resembled the present parliamentary system
 ganraajya yaa sangh kii nitiyon kaa sanchaalan inhen parishadon dwaara hota tha
 Its members were huge
 us samay ke sabase prasiddh ganraajya lichhavi kii kendriya parishad main 7707 sadsy the
 At the same time, there were 5000 members of the Central Council of Yudayya
 vartmaan sansadeey satr kii tarah hi parishadon ke adhiveshan niyamit rup se hote the
 Before any issue was decided, it was openly discussed among the members
 sahi-galat ke akalan ke liye paksh-vipaksh par joardaar bahes hoti thi
 Only then a unanimous decision was rendered
 sabaki sahmati na hone par bahumat prakriya apanaayi jaati thi
 In many places it was mandatory to have consensus
 bahumat se liye gayi nirnay ko ‘bhooyisikkim’ kaha jaataa tha
 Voting had to be resorted to
 tatkaaleen samay main vot ko 'chand' kaha jaataa tha
 Like the Election Commissioner, there was an officer overseeing this election called 'shalakagrahaka'; Used to say vot dene ke liye teen pranaliyaan thim- Esoteric - that is, by writing your vote on a letter in which the name of the person who voted was not known
 vivruthak – is prakriya main vyakti sambandhit vishay ke prati apane vichaar sabake saamne prakat karata tha
 That is, open public announcement
 sankarnajalpak - sadsy in teenon main se koi bhi ek prakriya apnaane ke liye swatantra the
 The chalakagrahaka used to calculate these votes with complete promptness and honesty
 is tarah ham pate hai ki pracheen kaal se hi hamaare desh main gauravshaalee loktantreey parampara thi
 Apart from this, a number of ministries were also created to govern orderly governance
 uttam gunon evam yogyata ke aadhaar par in mantralayon ke adhikariyon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa tha
 The major departments of the ministries were- audyogic tathaa shilp sambandhi vibhaag State Department janaganana Determination of rules of sale and purchase mantrimandal kaa ullekh hamen arthshaastra, manusmriti, shukraniti, mahabharat, ityadi main praapt hota he
 In the Yajurveda and Brahmin texts, they were called 'ratni'
 mahabharat ke anusaar mantrimandal main 6 sadsy hote the
 According to Manu, the number of members was 7-8
 shukr ne iske liye 10 kii sankhya nirdhaarit kii thi
 Their functions were as follows: - purohit- yah raja kaa guru mana jaataa tha
 This position was given only to a person skilled in both politics and religion
 uparaj - iskaa kaary raja kii anupasthiti main shashan vyavastha kaa sanchaalan karnaa tha
 pradhan-pradhan or Prime Minister was the most important member of the Cabinet
 vah sabhi vibhaagon kii dekhbhaal karata tha
 Secretary- Like the present defense minister, his job was to look after the work related to the security system of the state
 sumantra- rajya ke aay-vyay kaa hisaab rakhana iskaa kaary tha
 Chanakya called this a competence
 amaatya- amaatya kaa kaary sampurna rajya ke prakritik sansadhano kaa niyaman karnaa tha
 Envoy - Like the present-day intelligence, the job of the envoy was to organize the intelligence department
 yah rajya kaa atyant mahatvapurn evam samvedansheel vibhaag mana jaataa tha
 Apart from these, there were many departments
 itnaa hi nahin vartmaan kaal kii tarah hi panchayat vyavastha bhi hamen apane desh main dekhne ko milti he
 Villages were considered the basic unit of governance
 prayek gaanv main ek gram-sabha hoti thi
 The administration system of the village, from the judicial system to every welfare work of the village was carried out
 inkaa kaary gaanv kii prayek samasya kaa nipataara karnaa, aarthik unnati, raksha kaary, samunnat shashan vyavastha kii sthapana kar ek adarsh gaanv taiyaar karnaa tha
 The head of the Gram Sabha was called Gramani
 sara rajya choti-choti shashan ikaayiyon main banta tha or prayek ikai apane main ek chote rajya si thi or sthanik shashan ke nimitt apane main purna thi
 The governing power of the entire state was under one assembly, whose members were the heads of those governing units
 ek nishchit kaal ke liye sabakaa ek mukhya athwa adhyaksh nirvaachit hota tha
 If the assembly was large, an executive committee consisting of some of its members was elected
 yah shashan vyavastha athens main clysthenij ke samvidhan se milti-julati thi
 There were people of all ages, young and old in the meeting
 unki baithak ek bhawan main hoti thi, jo sabhaagaar kehalaata tha
 According to an ancient mention, the culprit was first presented to an officer named 'vinichayamahatram' for consideration
 nirparaadh hone par abhiyukt ko vah mukt kar saktaa tha par dand nahin de saktaa tha
 Used to send him to a higher court than himself
 is tarah abhiyukt ko chah ucch nyaayalayon ke sammukh upasthit hona padataa tha
 Only the king had the right to punish
 dharamshastra or purv kii najiron ke aadhaar par hi dand hota tha
 There were many republics in the country

 But after the fall of the Maurya Empire, some new democratic states were born

 The details of some of the major republics of ancient India are as follows: - shakya- shakya ganraajya vartmaan basti or gorakhpur jila ke kshetra main sthit tha
 The capital of this republic was Kapilavastu
 yah saat deevaaron se ghira hua sundar or surakshit nagar tha
 There were eighty thousand total and five lakh people in this union

 This assembly served both administration and justice

 Experts and special public here used to give some decision after consulting
 shakya parishad kaa adhyaksh raja kehalaata tha
 Shuddhodana Shakya, the father of Lord Buddha, was a Kshatriya king

 Lichchhavi - The Lichchhavi Republic was located to the north of the Ganges
 isaki rajdhani kaa naam vaishali tha
 Its remains are found in Basadh village of Muzaffarpur district of Bihar
 lichhavi kshatriya varna ke the
 Vardhman Mahavira was born in this republic

 The State Council of Vaishali consisted of 7707 members
 isi se isaki vishalata kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 There were two committees for governance
 pehali nau sadasyon kii samiti vaideshik sambandhon kii dekhbhaal karti thi
 The second eight-member committee administered the administration
 ise ishtkul kaha jaataa tha
 There were three types of experts in this system - decision-making, practical and formulaic
 lichhavi ganraajya tatkaaleen samay kaa bahut shaktishaalee rajya tha
 Repeated attacks were made on it
 antat: magadharaj ajatshatru ne is par akraman karke ise nasht kar diya
 But in the fourth century AD, it again became a powerful republic
 vajji- lichhavi, videh, kundgram ke gyaatruk gana tathaa anya paanch chote ganraajyon ne milakar jo sangh banaaya usee ko vajji sangh kaha jaataa tha
 The ruler of Magadha continued to attack it
 ant main yah sangh magadh ke adheen ho gaya
 Ambastha- This republic situated in Punjab had signed a treaty by not fighting with Alexander
 agrey- vartmaan agarwal jati kaa vikaas isi ganraajya se hua he
 In this republic, the armies of Alexander fought strongly

 Apart from these, the republics of Arishta, Autumvar, Kath, Kunind, Kshudraka, Patanaprastha, etc
 are also found in the ancient Ganths
 prayek rajya chaahe vah udaaravaadi ho yaa samaajawaadee yaa samyavaadee, yahaan tak ki sena ke general dwaara shasit pakistan kaa adhinayakawadi bhi apane ko loktantric kahata he
 To be honest, in today's era, claiming to be democratic has become a fashion
 loktantr kii purnatah sahi or sarvamaanya paribhaasha dena kathin he
 Cranston has rightly said that there are different perceptions regarding democracy
 linset kii paribhaasha adhik vyapak prathit hoti hai uske anusaar, “loktantr ek aisi raajnneetik pranali he jo padaadhikariyon ko badal dene ke niyamit sanvidhanik avasar pradaan karti he or ek aise rachanaatantr kaa praavdhaan karti he jiske tahat jansankhya kaa ek vishaal hissaa raajnneetik prabhaar praapt karne ke icchhuk pratiyogiyon main se manonukool chayan kar mahatvapurn nirnyon ko prabhavit karti he
 Defining democracy, mcpherson considered it 'the only constructive system in which governments are elected and authorized or laws are made and decided in some other form
 ‘ shoopter ke anusaar, ‘loktantric vidhi raajnneetik nirnay lene hetu aisi sansthagat vyavastha he jo janata kii saamaanya ichha ko kriyanvit karne hetu tatpar logon ko chaynit kar saamaanya hit ko saadhane kaa kaary karti he
 In fact, democracy is basically a system associated with participatory politics for civil and political freedom
 loktantr kii avadharana ke sambandh main pramukh siddhanth nimnlikhit hai: Concepts such as freedom, equality, rights, secularism and justice occupy a prominent place in the liberal tradition of democracy, and liberal thinkers have been advocating democracy as the best system to embody these concepts from the beginning
 nripatiyon or saamanti prabhuon se mukti ke baad samaaj ke shashan-sanchaalan kii drushti se loktantr ko swaabhaavik raajnneetik pranali ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya
 macpherson says that concepts like selection politics, competitive polity and market polity had developed even before the advent of democracy in the Western world
 hakeekat main is arth main udaar rajya kaa hi loktantrikaran ho gaya, na ki loktantr kaa udaarikaran
 The early signs of democratic sentiment can be found in the literature of British thinkers such as Tomsmoor and Winstanley and in the literature of British Extremism, but the true beginning of democratic sentiment began with the birth of the principle of social contract, because the inherent sense of social contract of citizens is the same for all individuals
 Equality
 thomas hobbs ne apni pustak ‘leviathan‘ main pramukh loktantric siddhanth kii vakaalat karte hue likhaa ki sarkaar kaa nirmaan janata dwaara ek saamaajik sanvida ke tahat hota he
 John Locke said that government should be done by the public and for his own benefit
 adam smith ne mukt bazaar kaa pratimaan is loktantric aadhaar par hi prastut kiya ki prayek vyakti ko utpaadan karne, kharidne or bechney kii swatantraaa he
 The famous utilitarian philosophers Mill and Bentham fully supported democracy and provided it with an effective intellectual foundation through utilitarianism
 unke anusaar, loktantr upyogetavaad arthath adhiktam logon ke adhiktam sukh ko adhiktam sangrakshan pradaan karata he, kyonki log apane shaskaon se tathaa ek duusare se sangrakshan kii apeksha rakhte hai or is sangrakshan ko sunishchit karne ke sarvottam tareeke hai, pratinidhimulak loktantr, sanvaidhanik sarkaar, niyamit chunaav, gupt matdaan, pratiyogi daleey raajnneeti or bahumat ke dwaara shashan
 J

 Mill added another point to Bentham's argument in favor of democracy, stating that democracy contributes more to the moral development of mankind than any other system of governance
 uski drushti main loktantr naitik atmotthana or vaiyaktik kshamtaaon ke vikaas evam vistaar kaa sarvocch madhyam he
 In this connection, it is noted that neither Bentham and Mill had any universal adult suffrage or one person favored one vote
 1802 tak bentham ne simit matadhikaar kii vakaalat kii or 1809 main sirf sampann virgon ke grihaswamiyon ke liye simit matadhikaar kaa naaraa diya or antatogatva 1817 main saarvbhaum matadhikaar kaa aahvaan kiya, lekin is adhikaar ko mardon tak hi simit rakhaa
 Similarly, Mill was also not in favor of universal adult suffrage, as he feared that the people of one class could maintain their dominance by being a majority and could only legislate their own interests against the interests of other classes
 aage chalakar usne apni pustak ‘ripregententive government‘ main usne kuch logon ke liye ek se adhik matdaan kii vakaalat kii lekin khayraat paane vaale akinchanon, niraksharon, diwaaliyon, kar nahin chukaane waalon ko, arthath un sabhi logon ko jo sanyukt rup se shramik varg kaa nirmaan karte hai, isse vanchit rakhaa
 He was only a supporter of a representative government that does not interfere with basic commonalities and follows a policy of free market and intervention
 baad ke udaaravaadi vichaarak loktantr kaa samarthan karte rahe or pashchimi europe tathaa uttari america ne isaki sweekaaryata ko or aage badhaane kaa kaam kiya
 The archaic liberal view of democracy has been challenged by many thinkers from time to time
 prathamtah, loktantr kii is manyata par prashn khadey kiye gaye hai ki prayek vyakti yah jaanata he ki uske liye sarvottam kya he
 Thinkers such as Lord Bryce, Graham Walls etc
 believe that man is not as judicious, neutral, knowledgeable or active as he is supposed to be for the operation of democracy
 dwitiyatah, loktantr janata ke shashan kii aadharshila par tikaa hota he, kintu yah spashtatah batalaana aasaan nahin he ki ‘shashan‘ or ‘janata‘ ke bilkul sahi arth kya he
 Hence Lokmat as the basis of government is a myth
 tritiytah loktantr se apeksha kii jaati he ki vah saamaanya hit kaa kaam karegaa, lekin saamaanya hit jaisi koi cheez nahin bhi ho sakati he
 The common interest in any society can hold different meanings for different people
 chaturthatah, puraatan udaaravaadi siddhanth samooh manovigyaan, samuhik utpeedan or pratyaayan tathaa janottejak netritv jaise karkon kii upeksha kar detaa he
 Fifthly, in democracy the party system often becomes a game of elite or controlled by those who are resourceful and they decide on important issues
 phir, niti-nirdhaaran kii prakriya bhi kaaphi jatil he
 Liberals have unduly considered it to be simple, transparent and just
 or sabase badi truti is siddhanth main yah he ki yah raajnneetik samanta kintu aarthik vishmata par aadhaarit he
 In the twentieth century, political thinkers began to raise the question whether the masses can play a role in politics in everyday life? Can ordinary citizens, who are engaged in earning their livelihood, invest time and power to play a political role? Will freedom be destroyed if the people openly display their feelings through electoral democracy without any restrictions? In answer to these questions, aristocratic and pluralistic principles of democracy have developed
 abhijan pad kaa prayog kisi samooh ke aise alpsankhyak varg ke liye hota he jo kuch karkon kii vajah se samudaay main vishisht haisiyat rakhte hai

 raajnneetik shreshthivarg, presnts ke anusaar, saamudayik maamalon main apane sankhya-bal ke anupaat main kahin zyada satta kaa upbhog karata he
 The emergence of the aristocracy in the context of democracy occurred after World War II, among the promoters of this theory are Wilfredo Pareto, Gratanomowska, Robert Michels, and American authors James Barnham and C
 Wright Mills
 is siddhanth kaa mukhya aadhaar yah manyata he ki samaaj main do tarah ke log hote hai- gine chune vishisht leg or vishaal jansamooh
 Distinguished people always reach the summit because they are the best people with all the qualifications
 abhijan varg vishesh rup se raajnneetik abhijan varg, saare raajnneetik krityon kaa nishpaadan karata he, satta par ekadhikaar kar letaa he or satta se jude saare laabh uthaata he
 The majority group is arbitrarily controlled and guided by the elite
 sangathit alpsankhyak hi hameshaa asangathit jansamooh ko shasit or nirdeshit karata he
 Robert Michels has used the phrase 'iron law of oligarchy' to say that the general classes must accept the subjugation of the elite class because a large section of the population is indifferent and incompetent in self-rule
 loktantr ke abhijan siddhanth kii mukhya visheshtaye hai : The well-known rendering of the elitist theory of democracy was first done by Joseph Schumpeter in his book 'capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'
 baad main sartori, robert daal, ikstine, remand aron, karl main hiyumond, sidney varba aadi ne apni rachanaaon main is mat kaa samarthan kiya
 This concept of democracy is based on the belief that the vast majority of the population is inefficient and neutral and that they elect some people based on merit and ability who control and govern the political party
 bahusankhyak log jeevika kamaane main vyast rahete hai
 They have neither interest nor understanding in political matters
 isliye ve abhijanvarg se kuch logon kaa chayan kar lete hai or unke anuyaayi ban jate hai
 According to the elitist theory, expertise is essential for efficiency in today's complex society and the number of experts is always small
 atah rajnatik netritv aise chuninda sakasham logon ke haath main hona aavashyak he
 This theory also considers the extreme participation of people as dangerous, because a powerful leader like dictator, Hitler, can mobilize the masses to destroy power and end democracy, which means the end of fundamental freedoms
 isliye unka daawa he ki loktantric or udaaravaadi mulyon ko bachaae rakhane ke liye jansamooh ko raajnneeti se alag rakhana jaruri he
 According to the eligibility principle, there cannot be actual rule by the general public
 shashan hameshaa janata ke liye hota he, janata ke dwaara kabhi nahi, kyonki janata jinhen pratinidhi chunati he ve abhijanvarg ke hi hote hai
 In other words, democracy means the rivalry among the elite classes and the decision by the public as to which elite will rule above
 is prakaar, loktantr maatr ek aisi karypranali he jiske dwaara chote samoohon main se ek janata ke newnatakam atirikt samarthan se shashan karata hai abhijanvaadee siddhanth yah bhi maanata he ki abhijan virgon- raajnneetik dalon, netaaon, bade vyapaaree gharaanon ke karypalkon, svaichhik sanghathanon ke netaaon or yahaan tak ki shramik sanghathanon ke bich mataiky aavashyak he taaki loktantr kii aadharbhoot karypranali ko gaiyr jimmdar netaaon se bachaaya ja sake
 This makes it clear that the elitist class theory externally claims to make the idea of democracy more pragmatic and empirical, but ultimately it transforms democracy into a conservative political theory that is satisfied with liberal or neo-liberal status quoism Gets and wants to maintain its durability
 abhijanwaad kii kai vichaarkon ne aalochana kii he jinamein si
 bi
 macmmersan, greem dancan, bairi holden, robert daal aadi pramukh hai
 The following are the main objections against this principle: loktantr kaa bahulwaadi siddhanth bhi jan saamaanya ke badale samoohon kii bhoomika par bal detaa he
 Some thinkers have represented such principles related to democracy which are a mixture of aristocratic principles and pluralistic principles
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki bahulwaadi siddhanth kii utpatti abhijan siddhanth kii aanshik pratikriya ke rup main hui he
 The elitist theory is satisfied with the creation of a situation in which power lies in the elites who make important decisions, but the pluralist insists on a system that will nullify the tendency of elitism in liberal democracies and reveal the right publicity 
 bahulwaad kii avadharana vaise to puraani he, kintu beesvin sadi main aadhunik udaaravaadi chintan kaa yah ek mahatvapurn ang ban gaya
 In general, pluralism propagates and decentralizes power in lieu of limiting it to a small group in society
 aadhunik audyogic or praudyogic kaal main, bahulawaadiyon ke anusaar, satta vikhandit ho gai he or isamen pratiyogi saarvajanik or nijee samoohon kii saajhedaari bad gai he
 People in high places no longer hold power like in the past, mainly because they began to play the role of mediator between conflicting interests
 vibhinn samooh apane netritv ke madhyam se madhyasthata karte hai or iske jariye vyakti kaa bhi pratinidhitiv ho jaataa he
 Although power has become concentrated among a few individuals due to industrial and technological integration and technological considerations, competition among minority but larger, interest groups goes in favor of public interest
 bade vyapaaree gharaanon, shram or sarkaar ke bich pratiyogita ne prayek samooh ko apni satta kaa durupyog karne par lagaam kasi he
 Thus, inequality in property, education and power among citizens is less affected as organizations and groups provide more representation than expected and this makes democracy more real and in this sense more viable
 bharat kaa hi udhaaharan len
 Here, the farmer organization of Mahendra Singh Tikait and the Narmada Bachao Andolan are such people's movements that become the voice of millions of poor and uneducated people
 or loktantr ko nishchay hi adhik vaastavik banaate hai
 It is true that the elites and their news media criticize them and call them a hindrance to progress and sometimes even the Supreme Court forces them to stop their movements, but in spite of all this, such mass movements make Indian democracy more meaningful

 loktantr kii bahuwaadi avadharana kaa vikaas mukhya rup se america main hua
 Among its proponents is S
 M
 Lancet, Robert Dal, V
 Presthes, F
 Hunter etc
 are prominent
 unka tark he ki raajnneetik satta utani saral nahin he jitani dikhaai padati he, yah vibhinn samoohon, sanghathanon, virgon or sanghon samet abhijan varg jo aamtaur par samaaj ko netritv pradaan karata he ke bich banty hui he
 Different selfish groups present their demands directly, but also through various political parties
 bahulwaadi loktantr kii ek paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he
 It is a political system in which policies are determined by mutual consultation and exchange of ideas between different groups because no group or elite is so strong that it can put enough pressure on the government alone to meet all its demands
 Could complete
 bahulwaadi satta kii is saajhedaari kaa anumodan karte hai ki isse laabh yah hota he ki koi bhi saamaajik samooh sarkaar kii niti- nirdhaaran kii prakriya par is kadar haaavee nahin ho paata ki vah anya virgon ke hiton kii andekhi kar sake
 But, there was also a belief of pluralist theorists that all citizens have the legal opportunity and economic resources to organize and pursue their interests in the political arena
 is avasar ke bagaiyr nagarik kisi prastaavit kadam kaa samarthan yaa virodh nahin kar sakate
 Pluralist thinkers consider politics to be a process of determination between groups rather than individuals, and declare that democracy works best only when citizens join groups supporting their special interests
 ve is baat par vishesh bal dete hai ki kisi samaaj main vyaktiyon kii sakriy sahabhaagita honi chahie or apane sankalp ko kriyanvit karne ke liye vibhinn samoohon se jud janaa chahie
 At the same time, all groups and their members must accept that elections are an effective weapon of participation of the larger community in political decisions
 isi tarah, abhijan varg ke saare samooh or sadsy parsparik pratiyogita ke dwaara loktantr ko sambhav banaate hai
 It is clear from this that the pluralistic theory does not really completely oppose elitism because according to its promoters, the existence of elite class is a reality and they are satisfied with its location
 yahi kaaran he ki bahulwaadi siddhanton kabhi-kabhaar abhijanvarg siddhanton se aanshik rup main hi bhinn samajha jaataa he
 The great American political thinker Robert Dal combines his elitist and pluralist notions of democracy and calls his democratic conception as a great system
 uske anusaar, janata samoohon or abhijanvarg ke raajnneetigyon donon ke madhyam se sakriy hoti he
 It has cited many communities that influence the policy making of the government - eg, business houses and industrialists, merchants, labor organizations, farmer organizations, consumers, voters, etc
 aisa nahin he ki unki puri kaarysoochee kriyanvit ho hi jaati he
 Not all groups are equally strong, and many groups are more effective at preventing adversaries than persuading them to have their own preferences
 bahulwaadi sinddhanth ke viruddh uthaai jane vaali aapattiyon main nimnlikhit pramukh hai: Participation in political activity is the core of democracy, but in capitalist democracies, it is often limited to voting in elections
 loktantr kaa sahabhaagita siddhanth sanwarddhit bhagidaari ko ek adarsh bhi maanata he or krutyaatmak aavashyaktaa bhi
 Prominent proponents of this theory include Carole Perlman, CB since the 1960s
 mcpherson and N
 Left-wing thinkers like Paul Jas have been prominent
 sahabhaagi loktantr kii do pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai: According to the principles of participatory democracy, if the task of making policy decisions is confined only to the elite, then the real nature of its democracy is disrupted
 isliye ve isamen aam aadmi kii sahabhaagita kii vakaalat karte hai
 They believe that if the democratic rights are confined to the pages of the paper or the articles of the constitution, then those rights have no meaning, hence the actual consumption of those rights by ordinary people is necessary
 lekin yah upbhog bhi tabhi sambhav he jabaki vyakti swatantra or samaan ho
 If people believe that opportunities for effective participation in policy decisions are not really present, then they will definitely become participants
 aisi sthiti main ve prabhavi dhang se saajhedaari bhi kar sakenge
 The democracy in which it is dominated by political or technical or democratic elite, is not satisfactory to the citizens and the people can end the class domination only through participation
 sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthakon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki aaj ke audyogic or praudyogic samaajon main shiksha kaa str unchaa ho gaya he or bauddhik tathaa rajnatik chetana se sampann samaaj main abhijan or gaiyr-abhijan ke bich kii khai kam hui he
 Therefore, participation of ordinary people is not a hindrance in most of the cases in terms of efficiency and development
 sach poocha jaae to satta kaa vikirnan hi atyaachaar ke viruddh sabase majboot suraksha-kavach he
 Only a democracy based on participation can protect citizens from neutrality, ignorance and isolation and can fulfill the basic needs of democracy
 prashn he, aam naagarik kii raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaise ho ? iske siddhantakaaron ne iske nimnlikhit tareeke bataae hai: mcpherson remarks that today's nations are vast in terms of region and population, and it is not possible that all citizens are involved in the political discourse or policy-making of the Rosemary, yet if certain conditions are accepted then the participation ratio is certain Can be increased ye sharte hai: David Held objected to the participatory principle, saying that it is better than the archaic / elite pluralist theories, but it is unclear how and why only the higher levels of participatory human development, which is an important goal of democracy, Will be able to achieve is baat kaa koi sakshya athwa tark sangat aadhaar nahin miltaa ki sahabhaagita nagarikon ko saamaanya hit ke prati adhik sahyogshil or patibaddh banaaegi
 Held also does not necessarily hold the central belief that ordinary people want to be more responsible in policy making and decision making on issues affecting their lives
 yadi ve saamaajik-aarthik maamalon or nitiyon ke nirdhaaran main bhaag lenaa nahin chahen to unhen iske liye baadhya karnaa uchit nahin mana ja saktaa
 Nevertheless, if the common people want to take their democratic tendencies beyond a threshold and start to interfere in the matter of basic freedom and rights, then what questions of democracy will happen, the supporters of the participation theory did not pay enough attention to such questions
 is
 cook or morgan ke anusaar sahabhaagi loktantr ko asli jama pehanaanaa utana aasaan nahin he jitna upree taur par prathit hota he
 For example, what should be the size and function of the participating unit, then how will the decisions taken at the local levels on the basis of active participation of citizens be coordinated and integrated with the interest of the entire nation? The policy matters of one local partner unit may be hostile to the other unit as well
 phir ek baat yah bhi he ki adhiktam sambhav sahabhaagita ke bal par liye gaye nirnay aavashyak nahin ki sarvaadhik kargar nirnay hon hi
 Supporters of participatory theory do not pay enough attention to issues of efficiency and effectiveness
 aam dharna ke vipareet loktantr ke vichaar ko marks or pashchavarti marxvaadi vichaarkon ne bhi sweekaar kar liya he
 So much so that their democracy-related conception is completely different from western liberal democratic conceptions
 chunki marxvaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki poonjivadi vyavastha main loktantric adhikaar sahi arth main aam janata ke paas na hokar sirf saadhan-sampann varg ke haath main hota he, isliye ve ek aise loktantr kii sthapana chaahate hai jo ‘janata kaa loktantr‘ ho
 In Marxist democracy, socialist democracy is established after the abolition of ownership over the means of production and controlling the economy by the proletariat
 marks udaaravaadi sanvaidhanik loktantr kaa aalochak tha kyonki uske anusaar poonjivadi loktantr kaa aadhaar ek aisi aarthik pranali hoti he jisamen utpaadan ke saadhan hameshaa puunjipati varg ke niyantran main hote hai
 This bourgeoisie keeps the government and the state system under its power by keeping it under the control of the political system
 rajya satta, adhikaar or visheshadhikaar purnatah usee varg ke paas hote hai or shramikvarg ke paas sirf naam kii swatantraaa or adhikaar hote hai
 The official class of the state, the court and the police force are also not the neutral but seekers of the sovereign class
 isliye, loktantr ek aisi shashan-pranali kaa rup akhriyaar kar letaa he jo shaasha varg kii satta or visheshadhikaar ko badhaava dene or ucch varg ke hiton ko saadhane ke kaam aata he
 In spite of this, Marx and Engels have accepted that even the moderate bourgeois democracy controlled by the thriving bourgeoisie can to some extent make historical claims to give real rights to its citizens and the working class can use it to organize the revolution of the proletariat
 can do
 udaaravaadi loktantron main aam matadhikaar kaa upyog sarvharavarg kii krantikari aandolan kii prishthbhumi taiyaar karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Marxists certainly believe that violent revolutionary movements may not be required in some situations, but the possibility of such situations is slim
 agar samaajawaadee kranti ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye sansadeey maarg apanaaya bhi jaataa he to yah anya prakaar ke sangharshon main ek atirikt sahaayak upkaran hi ho saktaa he
 According to Marxist analysis, real democracy is possible only after the proletarian revolution to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat, because the ideal of liberal bourgeois democracy can be of participation, but in reality the participation of the resourceless working class is not there
 apni rachana ‘da critic of da gotha program‘ main marks or angels ne apni avadharana ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ‘poonjivadi or samyavaadee samaaj ke bich main hi ek kaa duusare main roopantaran kii avadhi nihit hoti he
 Corresponding to this is a period of political transition in which the state has distinguished between totalitarianism and communism of the proletariat
 ve ise ek madhyavarti kaal maanate hai
 This results in the establishment of a communist society
 yah samajhnaa jaruri he ki karl marks or angenles ne adhinayakawad pad kaa prayog kis arth main kiya he
 In his view, each state has been the authoritarianism of the ruling social class
 poonjivadi vyavastha main yah varg sampann audyogic or vyapaaree burjua kaa tha jabaki unki apni avadharana vaala rajya kranti ke turant baad sarvhaara ke niyantran vaala rajya hoga or tab samaajawaadee punanirmaan kii prakriya shuru hogi jiskaa ant ek vargaheen samaaj kii sthapana main hoga
 Therefore, in his view, democracy and proletarian totalitarianism will run simultaneously, just as liberal democracy in the capitalist system is practically democracy and also the totalitarian ruler of the bourgeoisie of industrialists and business houses
 isiilie, marks or angels kaa kahana tha ki kranti or shramik varg ke aadhipaty ke pashchaat kii pranali ‘janata ke loktantr‘ kii pranali hogi
 He meant the mass population of the masses in place of a handful of rich bourgeoisie
 marks dwaara pratipaadit ‘janata kaa loktantr‘ kii pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai The creation of socialist societies further enhanced Marxist ideas, Lenin who established the first socialist state in Russia in 1917 introduced new interpretations of Marxist thought
 usne sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ko sweekaar kiya or samaajawaadee kranti ke iske mahatva par bal diya, lekin usne iske saath yah bhi jod diya ki sarvhaara varg kaa adhinayakawad vishaal sarvhaara sanghathan yaa samyavaadee dal dwaara hi prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 He described three stages of democracy: capitalist democracy, socialist democracy and communist democracy
 uske anusaar loktantr rajya kaa ek swaroop he or varg-vibhajit samaaj main sarkaar adhinayakawadi or loktantric donon hoti he
 It is democracy for one class and totalitarianism for another
 burjua varg chunki apane hit saadhan main poonjivadi pranali ko niyantrit or sanchalit karata he, isliye use satta se bedakhalkar samaajawaadee loktantr ko sthapit karnaa aavashyak he
 Lenin acknowledges that the newly established socialist state is as oppressive as the capitalist state
 sarvhaara varg ke shashan ko lagu karne ke liye yah aavashyak bhi he
 Since the bourgeoisie is very powerful, it becomes necessary for the proletariat to abolish the capitalist class by force in the early stages of socialist democracy
 sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ke samaksh do lakshya hote hai: According to Lenin, this task is mainly done by the communist party
 is tarah, lenin kii drushti main poonjivadi loktantr main sachcha loktantr nahin hota, jabaki sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad main purvaapeksh adhik loktantr hota he, kyonki yah bahusankhyak sarvhaara varg kaa shashan he
 He also claimed that eventually democracy would become unnecessary with the realization of true communism, as it would have no meaning in the context of that society
 marks, angels or lenin ke baad anek vichaarkon ne marxvad kii anek vyakhyaayein prastut kii he
 Among them are Edward Bernstein, Karl Cotsky, Rosa Lukjamvarg, etc
 edward bernstin kaa daawa he ki poonjeevaad kii marxvaadi vyakhya galat he or sarvhaara kaa adhinayakawad na to aavashyak he, na vaanchhneeya
 According to him, political democracy and liberal freedoms are more important
 lenin kii yah manyata sahi nahin he ki sarvhaara kaa adhinayakawad aavashyak he
 Bernstein argues that until the proletariat attains majority, socialist revolution is impossible and totalitarianism is no longer needed if it achieves majority
 uske anusaar loktantr aavashyak he or marxvaadi samaajawaadee siddhanth ke saath loktantric parampara ko jodakar hi samaajwaad kii sthapana ho sakati he
 Raising the objection to Lenin's anti-democracy policy, Marxist revolutionary Rosa Luxembourg has said that it establishes totalitarianism over a large population, not the dictatorship of the vast masses

 According to the eligibility principle, expertise is essential for efficiency in today's complex society and the number of experts is always small
 atah rajnatik netritv aise chuninda sakasham logon ke haath main hona aavashyak he
 • Democracy is simply a mechanism by which one of the small groups governs with minimal support from the public
 The elitist theory also believes that the elite classes - political parties, leaders, executives of big business houses, leaders of voluntary organizations and here It is necessary to have a consensus among the labor organizations so that the basic functioning of democracy is determined by non-responsible leaders
