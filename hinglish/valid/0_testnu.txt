 This practice is signed by 19 states, including 3 with some reservations, the contiguous states, Brazil and Peru
 )
 The convention sets out the definition, rights and duties of statehood
 Most well-known is article 1, which sets out the four criteria for statehood that have sometimes been recognized as an accurate statement of customary international law: Furthermore, the first sentence of article 3 explicitly states that "the political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states
" This is known as the declarative theory of statehood
 Some have questioned whether these criteria are sufficient, as they allow less-recognized entities like the Republic of China or even entirely non-recognized entities like the Principality of Sealand to claim full status as states
 According to the alternative constitutional theory of statehood, a state exists only insofar as it is recognized by other states
 It should not be confused with the Estrada doctrine
 There have also been attempts to further broaden the convention's definition, although they have gained less support
 Founders of non-territorial micronations commonly assert that the requirement in the Montevideo Convention of a defined territory is in some way wrong-headed, for largely unspecified reasons
 Some non-territorial entities, notably the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, are indeed considered subjects of international law, but these do not aspire to statehood
 The states that signed this convention are: Honduras, United States of America, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Cuba 
 However, as a restatement of customary international law, the Montevideo Convention merely codified existing legal norms and its principles therefore do not apply merely to the signatories, but to all subjects of international law as a whole
 The European Union, in the principal statement of its Badinter Committee, follows the Montevideo Convention in its definition of a state: by having a territory, a population, and a political authority
 The committee also found that the existence of states was a question of fact, while the recognition by other states was purely declaratory and not a determinative factor of statehood
 Switzerland, although not a member of the European Union, adheres to the same principle, stating that "neither a political unit needs to be recognized to become a state, nor does a state have the obligation to recognize another one
 At the same time, neither recognition is enough to create a state, nor does its absence abolish it

 The following different theories have been formulated on the causes of earthquakes: pratyasth pratikshep siddhant - san 1906 main harry fielding read ne is siddhant ko pratipaadit kiya tha
 This theory came to light after a thorough study and survey of the San Francisco earthquake
 is siddhant ke anusaar bhuparpati par neeche se koi bal lambii avadhi tak kaary kare, to vah ek nishchat samay tathaa bindu tak us bal ko sahegi or uske pashchaat chattaanon main vikruti utpann ho jaaegi
 If the force continues to work even after the deformation occurs, the rocks will break

 computing yani sanganan main feed agrigater, jise feed reader, news reader yaa saadharantah agrigater kaha jaataa he ek desktop yaa web anuprayog hota he jo ki internet par muhaiyaa syndicated masaude, masalan samachar surkhiyaan, blog, podcast or vlog kaa sankalan kar ek hi sthaan par use pradarshit karata he
 As this content keeps on changing or updating, the compiler has to constantly monitor the draft feed
 is lekh main agrigater ke liye sankalak shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, par dhyaan rahe ki yah maanak shabd nahin he
 The syndicated draft that the compiler accepts is usually provided in RSS or any other formatted format such as RDF or Atom
 sankalak jaalasthalon yani websits par nai saamagree jode jane kaa pataa lagane main vyay hone vaale samay va shram kii bachat karata he or ek tarah se pathak ke liye uskaa vyaktigat akhbaar bana kar use pesh karata he
 Once a feed has been subscribed or become a regular reader, the compiler locates the new content at fixed intervals according to the user's wish and delivers the content to it
 is takanic ko pul taknalaji kaha jaataa he
 This is the exact opposite of push technology used in tools such as email or instant messaging
 saath hi push takanic se saamagree ke graahakon kii tulana main sankalak badi saralata se kisi bhi feed se anasbsakraib kar saktaa he yani uskaa pathak banane se inkaar kar saktaa he
 Most compilers also allow the user to export and import a list of feeds read by his or other readers in OPML format
 kai portal jaalasthalon main sankalan kii suvidha jalsthal par hi muhaiyaa he, masalan maai yahuu yaa ai google par
 This feature is also available on modern web browsers and email programs
 sankalak masaude ko samahit kar kisi ek hi brouzar yaa desktop anuprayog par pesh kar detaa he
 These applications are also called RSS readers, feed readers, feed aggregators, news readers or search aggregators
 jin sankalkon main podcasting kii kabaliyat he ve swatah media filein jaise kii empi3 ricarding kaa adhibharan yaa downlod bhi kar saktaa he
 In some cases, it can also load these files directly into portable media players such as ipods connected to computers
 haal hi main kuch naye sankalak, jinhen "aresas narator" pukaara ja rahaa he, bhi maidan main utre hai jo na keval feed masaude kaa sankalan karte hai balki unhen aflin yani internet se jude bagaiyr audio ricarding ke rup main sunne kii suvidha dete hai
 Web-based compilers are applications that are located on remote servers and are used on a network of applications such as Google Reader or bloglines
 chunki ye anuprayog internet ke madhyam se prayukt hote hai atah prayokta apni sabsakribd feed ko jahaan bhi internet sampark uplabdh ho vahaan pard saktaa he
 Modern compilers use technologies like Agax and are also available as multiple widgets
 vyaktigat sankalkon ke alaava saamudayik sankalak bhi hote hai jo saamanytah kisi laghu samudaay ke feed kaa sankalan karte hai
 For example, see the page of the list of compilers at the end of the article
 clyant yaa desktop anuprayog kaa zyaadaatar computer par baqayda sthaapan kiya jaataa he
 Their graphical user interface is similar to most popular email clients such as Outlook, with a draft showing in most three panels, a list of subscribed feeds on the left, which can be grouped into groups, folders, or squares, and a draft entry in the right panel
 kai anuprayogon main tikar tepe yaa news tikar yaa alert ke rup main nai pravishtiyon ke bare main jaankaree hasil kii ja sakati he
 Many programming languages provide libraries that application builders or website owners can read feeds using or display or use in different formats

 Media compilers, also known as podcatchers due to the popularity of podcasts, are compilers of feeds in which the draft is primarily audio or video
 feed main ye ke rup main daale jate hai
 These can be mesh or desktop based applications
 ye media ko downlod kar use chalaa sakate hai yaa ypod jaise kisi bahari media player ke saath sikronies bhi kar sakate hai
 Content redundancy is a fundamental problem with compilers, especially if the user is a reader of multiple feeds
 sankalak alag alag taur par is samasya se nibatate hai
 In addition to facilitating the categorization of feeds to the user, they take advantage of the tags and keywords attached to the entries

 Theva is a unique handicraft that flourished under the patronage of the royal houses of Rajasthan during the Mughal period in the 17th century
 theva kii hastkala kala striyon ke liye sone minaakaari or paardarshee kaanch ke mail se nirmit aabhushan ke nirmaan se sambaddh he
 Many of its craftsmen-families live only in Pratapgarh district of Rajasthan
 theva-aabhushanon ke nirmaan main vibhinn rangon ke shishon ko chaandi ke maheen taron se bane frem main daal kar us par sone kii baarik kalakritiyaan ukeri jaati he, jinhen kushal or daksh haath chote-chote aujaaron kii madad se banaate hai
 This jewelery-making art is one of the few in the world because of its originality and artistry - which can quickly become extinct in the absence of international market and marketing
 "theva" naam kii utpatti is kala ke nirmaan kii do mukhya prakriyaaon 'tharana' or 'waada' se mil kar hui he
 In this art, on the first glass, a very thin work or sheet of gold is made, and a fine mesh is made on it, which is called tharana
 duusare charan main kaanch ko kasne ke liye chaandi ke baarik taar se frem banaaya jaataa he, jise "wada" kaha jaataa he
 It is then heated in a fiery fire
 falswaroop shishe par sone kii kalakriti or khubasurat dizin ubhar kar ek nayab or laajawab kriti kaa aabhushan ban jaati he
 This craft, called the Charisma of Kanchan on glass, is like a golden painting on glass, which takes birth on the foundation of painting
 is shilp kii rachana jatil, kathin tathaa shramsadhy to he hi, parantu sone par chitrankit shilp ko kaanch main samahit kar dene kaa kamaal in mutthi bhar kaarigaron ke hi bas kii baat he
 The craft depiction is engraved on a 23 carat gold leaf with a special pen called 'tankal' and expertly mounted on multicolored glass
 jab donon padaarth sona or kaanch paraspar jud kar ekmec ek jeev ho jate hai to sone main kaanch or kaanch main sona dikhalaai padataa he
 This is called Theva Kala
 kaanch kii jhagamag ko or adhik prabhaavshaalee tathaa umdaa banaaye rakhane ke liye ise ek khaas prakriya se guzarana padataa he jisase ki kaanch main samahit sone kaa kaary ubhaar dene lage or dekhne vaale ke man ko chhu le
 In this way, each specimen of the craft is made of transparent glass and has an appearance like rubies, emeralds and sapphires
 is kala ko ukerne main belgium se vishesh prakaar ke kaanch istemaal hote the, par aise kaanchon kii anuplabdhta se ab alag umdaa kaanch kaa istemaal hota hai
 Initially, Theva's work was done only on the precious stones of red, blue and green, diamond, emerald, etc
 But now this work is also being done on yellow, pink and black glass gems
 pehle is kala se banaae jane vaale baks, plates, dish aadi par dharmik anukritiyaan or lokapriy lokkathaayen ukeri jaati thim, lekin ab yah kala aabhushan ke saath-saath pendents, year-ring, taai or sadiyon kii pin, kafalinks, photophreme aadi main bhi prachlit ho chali he
 Efforts are being made to popularize this art by diversifying the modern fashion into various designs
 is kala ko jaanane vaale desh main ab gine chune parivaar hi bache hai
 These families belong to the Rajsoni family living in the newly formed Pratapgarh district of Rajasthan, which has received several international, national and state level awards for this unique art

 Efforts to protect the government of Rajasthan's unique jewelery tradition are still insufficient

 It is noteworthy that Geographical Indication is given to a product for its geographical quality and identity with its origin and prevalence in particular location

 The Satrapas or Kshatrapas were said to be the governors of the provinces of the Meidi kingdom of ancient Iran and the Hakhamani kingdom
 is shabd kaa prayog baad main aane vaale saasaani or unani samrajyon ne bhi kiya
 In the modern era, a leader who works under a great power is sometimes informally called 'satrap'
 kisi satraap ke adheen kshetra ko satrapi kaha jaataa tha
 The word 'satrap' comes from the Avastai language and the word 'khatthrapavan' of the ancient Persian language
 is shabd main 'kshafur' sanskrit ke sajaateey shabd 'kshetra' se miltaa-julata he
 The word 'holy' means 'protector' in ancient Persian, which is derived both from the word 'follow' in Sanskrit and from the word 'holy'
 'kshabarapavan' samay ke saath parivartit ho gaya - 'kshafur' to 'shahar' ban gaya or 'paavan' 'baan' yaa keval 'pa' ban gaya
 From this, the word is found as 'satrap' and as 'shaharban', which in Sanskrit 'kshetrapal' would have been equal
 pracheen farsi main iske jaisi 'shoijerapaiti' oopaadhi bhi milti he, jiskaa sanskrit anuwaad 'kshetrapati' saral he or thik yahi oopaadhi chhatrapati shivaji ke liye prayog hoti he
 'kshatrap' is the name given to the provincial rulers by the Persian emperors in ancient times
 ibrani kaa 'shakhshadrapan' bhi isi arth main prayukt hua he
 It means 'protector of the state'

 According to Herodotus, the great of Kurush divided his empire into several provinces; Daryavosh organized them in a certain way and built 21 Kshatrap provinces throughout their empire and also fixed their tax
 kshatrapon tathaa upakshatrapon kaa sarvapratham kaary apane praanton kaa bhoomikar ikattha karnaa tha
 The Kshatrapa used to pay the residual portion to the Emperor by removing the royal army, judges and personal expenses from this tax
 yadi kshatrap samraat kaa kripapaatr bananaa chahta to vah samraat ke bhaag kii maatra adhik kar detaa
 There was no fixed amount of money for the emperor from the satraps
 saare aay kaa hisaab rakhane tathaa samrat ke bhaag kii nigaraanee karne ke liye rajkeey kysth rahata tha
 He used to get royal orders from the emperor
 is prakaar di hui ajna ke shighratisheeghra paalan kii aashaa kii jaati thi
 In this, even the barrier was considered rebellion
 kshatrapon ko iske liye dand bhi miltaa tha
 And like the Turkish Empire, there was no formality in their punishment
 kshatrapon ke paas samrat kii ajna pahunchaane kii vidhi ke liye ek din kii yatra kii duuri par ek vyakti rahata tha
 The message was sent to each other, to the third, thus to the satraps
 faras ke samraaton ke paas kshatrapon kii adheenta praapt karne ke liye anya prakaar bhi the ek kamishnar ko sena ke sangrakshan ke saath vaataavaran tathaa aavashyaktaa ke anusaar krupa pradaan karne athwa dand dene ke liye bheja jaataa tha
 According to Xenophon, this practice had been going on since the beginning of the empire and was prevalent during its time
 kshatrapon ke kaary kii nigaraanee ke liye samrat swayan samrajya ke prayek pradesh main prativarsh jaaya karata tha
 If he could not go on his own, he would have sent one of his representatives
 kshatrapon ke apane praant main bhoomi kii urvartaa athwa krishi kii abhivruddhi ke liye vishesh prayaas karne par unako kuch or bhi praant pradaan kar die jate kintu jahaan yah suvyavastha nahin praapt hoti thi vahaan se pradesh ko katkar duusare kshatrap praanton main mila diya jaataa tha
 The rule of administration in the provinces was on the emperor, who appointed his brother, a family or son-in-law as a satrap
 bharatvarsh main nahpaan ne apane damaad ushavadaat ko kshatrap bana rakhaa tha
 Due to the close relationship with the emperor, luxury was reflected in the life of satraps like the emperor
 kshatrap ke darbar main bhi samrat kii bhanti aupchaarikta barti jaati thi
 Like the emperor, Kshatrapas used to have their own Antapur
 antpur main clivon kii paryaapt sankhya rahati thi
 Apart from the royal army, there was a personal army of satraps
 samrat kii hi bhanti unke mehalon main bhi udyaan, pramadavan, aadi hote the
 Like emperors, they also used to travel from one place to another in certain months of the year
 kshatrapon ko is prakaar adhik rajkeey shakti swat praapt thi
 Apart from being the commander of military and other powers, there was one more thing, due to which the satraps became very powerful and there was a possibility of their rebellion
 kabhi kabhi ve vidroh kar bhi dete the
 Once the presidency of two or more Kshatrapa provinces was made a single Kshatrap, which was called Mahakshatrap
 inhen adhik sainyashakti tathaa rajkeey shakti praapt hoti thi jo unke vidroh main sahaayak hoti thi
 An example of this is found only during the reign of Darnavosh
 aarokliz ne, jo fijia tathaa lidia donon kaa kshatrap tha, vidroh kar diya tha parvarti shaskaon ke kaal main, visheshkar laghu asia main, kshatrapon ke vidroh adhik hone lage
 This trend of satrap has increased continuously since the time of the miniature Kurusha
 kshatrap kabhi kabhi khulaa vidroh bhi karte the or apane ko swatantra shaasha ghoshit kar dete the
 Many of these rebellious satraps established several dynasties and later became completely independent
 in sabake baavjood samrat unki adheenta praapt karne main safal rahata tha
 The main reason for this was mutual discord and war among the satraps
 iske atirikt darbar main striyon kii adhikta tathaa vyabhichaar ke vaataavaran se bhi kshatrapon ke vyaktitv main sahaj dheelaapan aane lagata tha
 The Kshatrapas did not consider themselves to be appointed for the protection of the provinces, but considered their suzerainty over them
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi tha ki kshatrapeey prashasan kii vyavastha anshat anuvanshik bhi thi
 They used to consume landlords and other incomes of Kshatrapa provinces
 xenophan ke samay misia ke ek kshatrap ne upakshatrap bhi niyukt kiya tha jise us pradesh ke log kar dete the or vah ulke badale vyavastha karata tha
 The same arrangement was done for his widow after his death
 is prakaar kii vyavastha ne samrajya ke dhaanche ko sahaj hi dhilaa kar diya
 In later times, the satraps also got the right to operate the state army, especially when it belonged to the royal family or some of its relatives
 laghukurush misia, fizia, tathaa lidia kaa kshatrap tha par yuddh main sampurna sena kaa senapati bhi vahi tha
 The same situation is also with the Farnbases and other satraps, but this does not mean that there was military rule in the Kshatrap provinces
 vastut samrat sainik tathaa samaaj ke adhikariyon, donon ko swayan niyukt karata tha
 He also used to appoint magistrates himself
 kshatrap magistriton ke kaary main hastkshep nahin kar saktaa tha
 The system of regional administration was adopted by Alexander and his successors as well, especially in the kingdom of Silukas
 bharatvarsh main shakon ke jo rajya sthapit hue unamem bhi kshatrapeey rajyavyavastha thi
 Indian satraps had three major dynasties and a dynasty- kapisha, pushppur tathaa abhisar ke kshatrapon kaa pataa vahaan se praapt abhilekhon se miltaa he
 In the Manikyala inscription, there is mention of a Kshatrap, son of Granvvrayak
 use kapisha kaa kshatrap bataaya jaataa he
 The Kabul Museum inscription of the 83rd year mentions a satrap named Tiruvarna of Pushpur
 abhisarprast se praapt ek taanbe kii anguthi ke aakaar kii mudra par kshatrap shivasen kaa naam praapt he
 The Kshatrapas of Punjab belong to three dynasties - mathura ke kshatrap - is vansh main sabase pehla rajuvul athwa ranjuvul tha jisane sambhawatah pehle sakal par bhi rajya kiya tha
 Stancono estimated that lineage as follows: rajuvul kaa naam abhilekhon tathaa mudraon main praapt hota he
 In the Mora Krupa inscription he is called Mahakshatrap
 kintu uski mudraon par praapt lekh main use 'rajaadhiraj' kaha gaya he
 Razuvul was succeeded by Shudas
 abhilekhon main bhi use mahakshatrap kaha gaya he
 Some scholars consider the years given in their inscriptions and some in Vikram Samvat
 is matbhed ko mitaane kaa saadhan abhi tak praapt nahin ho sakaa he
 According to Kono, Kharoshth was Rajvul's brother-in-law and according to Palit, Dahitra
 ek anya mudra par kharoshtee lipi main ‘kshatrapas prakhar ostas artsputras’ likhaa hua miltaa he
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding the origin of these satraps
 kabhi unhen palhaav, kabhi shaq desh se aayaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 Probably they were suspicious
 faras se hokar aane ke kaaran ve kshatrapeey shashan vyavastha se parichit or usase sambhddha ho gayi; inke atirikt hagaan or hagaamash naamak do kshatrapon kii bhi mudraayen mathura se praapt hui hai
 Which is supposed to be the ruler of Mathura after the Rajuvul dynasty
 kuch sikkon par donon ke sanyukt naam bhi milte hai or kuch par keval hagaamash kaa hi
 After them there were two to three Kshatrapas in Mathura, whose names are Indian
 kadachit is kaal tak in videshiyon ne purnroop se bhartiyata grahan kar lee thi
 Ujjain's Kshatrapas - Ujjain's Kshatrapas are also called as 'kshatrapas of Western India'
 ye kshatrap do vanshon ke prathit hote hai
 The first dynasty was of Bhumak and Nahapan and the second was of Chashtan
 bhumak ke uttaradhikari nahpaan kaa pataa uski rajat evam tamramudraon se hi nahin varan uske damaad ushavadaat ke abhilekhon se bhi lagaaya jaataa he
 Nahapan also ruled over some part of Western India
 usne satvaahan ke samrajya kaa kuch bhaag bhi jeet liya tha
 Its dynasty is called Shehrat
 shaharaat vansh ko rudradaaman pratham ne samaapt kiya
 In the Girnar inscription he is called Khakharat Vasnivasse Karas
 ujjain main shashan karne vaale dwitiya vansh ke kshatrapon main kardamakavansheey chashton ke pita yasmotik kaa naam sarvapratham aata he
 Chashthan's son Jayadaman was a Kshatrap but he probably died during his father's lifetime and Ujjain was ruled by Chasthan and Rudradamana together
 junagarh abhilekh main mahakshatrap rudradaaman ke sambandh main kaha gaya he ki usne mahakshatrap kii oopaadhi arjeet kii thi
 It seems that the kingdom of his dynasty was probably taken away by Gautamiputra Satakarni and Rudradamon had to earn the title of Mahakshatrap by winning those territories again
 junagarh abhilekh main uski vijayon tathaa uske vyaktitv kii prashasti he
 Rudradaman i was succeeded by his eldest son Damaghasad
 uske pashchaat damaghasad kaa putr jivadaman tathaa uskaa bhai rudrasingh pratham uttaradhikari hue
 It was during this Rudrasingh that the Abhiras captured some part of the state of the Western satraps
 rudrasingh pratham ke uttaradhikari uske teen putr rudrasen pratham, sanghdaaman tathaa damsen hue
 Subsequently, Damasen had three sons, Yashodaman, Vijayasena and Damajadashree Mahakshatrap
 daamajadashri kaa uttaradhikari uskaa bhatija rudrasen dwitiya hua
 After this, he had sons Vishwasinh and Bhartradamana
 bhartrudaman ke hi kaal se uskaa putr vishwasen uskaa kshatrap bana
 What was the relationship between Bhartradaman and Vishwasingh with Mahakshatrap Rudradaman II
 yah nishchaypurvak nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The last satrap of this dynasty was Rudrasingh III who ruled till about 388 AD

 sthaneey bhashaa main "jam" shabd kaa arth hota he, "sardaar" jise amuman sammaan vansh va sammaan shasit pradeshon main raja ke liye upyog kiya jaataa tha
 And with the name "jam", for his due respect, it was also addressed as "sahib"
 "jam sahab" ke kitaab kaa upyog sabase pehle jam rawalji jadeja ne kiya tha jab unhone 1540 main kuccha main apni pushtaini riyasat se palaayan kar halaar ke ~1,000 gaanvon par kabza kiya tha, jo baad main nawanagar riyasat bani
 The current city of Gujarat, Jamnagar, is named after "jam Sahab"

 Bullets generally do not contain explosives, but they penetrate their targets with full effect and damage them
 shabd "goli" kaa upyog kabhi kabhi barood, yaa ek kaartoos ke liye bhi aamtaur par kiya jaataa he, jo goli, khol, powder or primer kaa mishran hota he
 Therefore, the use of the word "bullet" to describe ammunition or cartridges is not technically correct
 goliyon kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitna ki banduukon kaa
 Originally, bullets were balls of metal or stone that were used as a weapon and in a slingshot for hunting
 ant main jab banduukon kaa vikaas ho gaya, inhen choti gendon ko ek band tub ke ant main gan powder ke ek visphotak charge ke saamne rakhaa jane laga
 As the gun became more technologically advanced, from 1500 to 1800 there was little change in the bullets
 ve sise kii saadhaaran round gende hoti thim, jinhen rounds kaha jaataa tha, inke keval vyas main bhinnata milti thi
 Molded lead balls were used as projections with the development of hand culverines and matchlock archwebs
 The word "bullet" is derived from the French word Bullette, which means small ball
 bandook main prayukt mul goli ek gol sise kii gend thi jo ek bor se choti hoti thi, ise deele feet paper ke ptch main lapeta jaataa tha, jo beral main powder ke upar goli ko dridhtaa se pakad letaa tha
 Was called isiilie, puraane smood bor brown base or isi tarah kii sainya banduukon ke saath, goliyon ko bandook main lod karnaa aasaan hota tha
 On the other hand, the original funnel-loading rifle, in which the bullets were fitted more closely to rifle the grooves, was more difficult to load, especially when the barrel bore had deteriorated from previous firing
 For that reason, early rifles were not used for military purposes
 unnisvin sadi kii pehle pachaas saalon main goli kii akruti or kaaryon main vishisht parivartan dekhe gaye
 In 1826, Delvigne, a French infantry officer, invented a breech with unconnected shoulders, on which a circular bullet was injected until it was loaded into the grooves of the rifle
 haalanki, delvigne kaa tarika thik nahin tha or isane goli ko vikrut kar diya
 The first bullet in a series of pointed or "cone-shaped" bullets was designed in 1823 by Captain John Norton of the British Army
 norton kii goli main ek khokhla aadhaar tha jo bairal kii rifling ke liye, firing karne par dabaav ke saath fail jaataa tha
 The British Ordnance Board disapproved of it as the circular bullet was in use for the last 300 years
 prasiddh angreji bandook banane vaale wiliam greenar ne 1836 main greenar goli kaa avishkaar kiya
 It was very similar to Norton's bullet, with one difference being that its hollow base was fitted with a wooden plug that exerted more definite pressure on the base to expand and hold the rifling
 pareekshan se yah sabit ho gaya ki greenar kii goli bahut prabhavi thi lekin ise sainya upyog ke liye asweekrut kar diya gaya kyonki, yah mana gaya ki do bhaag hone ke kaaran iskaa nirmaan bahut mushkil he
 The soft lead mini ball was released in 1847 by Claude Attini Mini, a captain of the French Army
 yah lagbhag greenar goli ke samaan thi
 The Mini was designed by a cone-shaped bullet with a hollow cavity in its rear, with a small iron cap fitted instead of a wooden plug
 jab isse fire kiya jaataa tha yani goli chalayi jaati thi, to lohe kii topi bullate ke rear par khokhli gupha main chali jaati thi, jiske dwaara rafiling ko majboot karne ke liye bullate ke said fail jate the
 In 1855, the British adopted a mini ball for their Enfield rifle
 mini ball kaa pehali baar sabase zyada istemaal america naagarik yuddh ke dauraan kiya gaya
 Roughly in this war, 90% of casualties were due to mini balls fired from rifles
 1854 or 1857 ke bich, sar joseph vitworth ne rifl par ek lambi shrinkhalaa main prayog kiye or anya binduon main, chote bor ke phaayde ko sabit kiya or, vishesh rup se, lambi goli ke phaayde ko bhi pramanit kiya
 Witworth's bullet was made in such a way that it could be mechanically fitted to the grooves of the rifle
 Witworth's pill was never adopted by the government, although it was used extensively for match purposes and target practice between 1857 and 1866, when it was gradually replaced by Metford

 The combined result was that in December 1888, lee-metford's small bore rifle, Mark I, was finally adopted by the British Army

 The next significant change in the history of rifle bullets came in 1882, when Edward Rubin, director of the Swiss Army Laboratory at Thun, invented a copper-jacketed bullet — a long shot whose lead core was that of a copper
 Was kept in a jacket
 yah bhi chote bor vaali thi or yah 8mm kii "label bullate" kii purvarti he jise Mle 1886 kii label rifl ke dhune rahit powder barood ke liye apanaaya gaya tha
 The surface of lead bullets fired at high speed can melt due to hot gases present and friction with the bore
 kyonki tambe kaa galnaank ucch hota he or vishisht ushma or kathorta kaa maan bhi bhi adhik hota he, copper kii jacket main upasthit goliyon ke kaaran thuthan kii gati bad jaati he
 Modernized aerodynamics led to the development of the pointed Spitzer bullet
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat tak, duniya kii adhikansh senaayen spitzar bullate kii ore sankramit ho gayin thim
 These bullets could be fired more accurately and had more energy
 spitger bullate or mashin gan ke sangyojan ne yuddh kii ghaatkata ko bahut adhik badha diya
 The most modern refurbishment that took place in the shape of a bullet or bullet is a boat-like tail, a grounded base for the Spitzer bullet
 ucch jab hawa goli ke antim sire par teji se hokar jaati he, tab nirvaat utpann ho jaataa he, jisase projectile kaa veg kam ho jaataa he
 The design of the tailbone, such as a base boat, allows air to flow over the surface of its end, reducing the form drag
 iske parinamswaroop vayugatiki laabh ko vartmaan main rifl takanic ke liye anukool akruti ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The first combination of the Spitzer and the boat-like tail bullet is named Bell "D" after its discoverer, it was released as standard military ammo in 1901, for the French-labeled Model 1886 rifle
 bullate ke dizin main do praathmik samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karnaa he
 a seal with the bore of the gun should be made in them first
 If a strong seal is not made, the gas will leak from the propellant charge after the bullet is removed, which will reduce this efficiency
 bullate ko rifling kii prakriya main is tarah se kaam karnaa chahie ki bandook ke bor ko koi kshati naa pahunche
 The tablets should have a surface that forms this seal without causing too much friction
 bullate or bor ke bich is antarkriya ko aantarik prakshepiki kaha jaataa he
 Bullets should be produced at a high standard, as surface deformities may affect firing accuracy
 bairal se nikalne ke baad goli ko prabhavit karne vaali bhautikee, bahari prakshepiki kehalaati he
 Factors that affect the aerodynamics of a bullet flying are the shape of the bullet and the rotation caused by the rifling of the barrel of the gun
 ghurni bal goli ko vayugathik rup se or gayroscopy rup se sthirikrut karte hai
 Any asymmetry in a bullet or bullet is largely canceled out when it spins
 chikne bor kii banduukon ke saath, ek golakaar akruti anukool thi kyonki is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki yah kaise unmukh hui, isane ek samtal saamne vaale hisse ko prastut kiya
 These unstable bullets would collapse erratically, or roll backward and disastrously, providing only moderate accuracy, although the aerodynamic shape changed little over the centuries
 aam taur par, goli kii akritiyaan vayugatiki, aantarik prakshepiki jaruraton or antim prakshepiki aavashyaktaaon ke bich ek samjhauta thim
 Another method of stabilization for the pellet's mass center is to stay as far ahead as in practice in a mini ball or shuttlecock

 See how the terminal ballistics and / or pill design affects its stopping ability, what happens when a bullet affects an object
 prabhaav ke parinaam kaa nirdhaaran lakshya saamagree ke sanghatan or ghanatv, aapatan kone or khud goli ke veg or bhautik gunon ke dwaara hota he
 The bullet is usually designed in such a way that it can penetrate, deform and / or break the target
 ek di gayi saamagree or goli ke liye, takaraane kaa veg vah praathmik kaarak he jo parinaam kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 In fact, there are many bullet shapes and they are of many types and a table can be found in any reloading manual that sells bullet molds
 RCBS, kai nirmaataaon main se ek he, jo kai bhinn dizin pesh karata he, jo basic round ball se shuru hote hai
 With a mold, one can also make bullets at home to reload their shelled ammo, where local laws allow this
 haath se casting, haalaanki, thos sise kii goliyon ke liye keval samay- or laagat- prabhavi he
 Cast and jacketed bullets have also been commercially made available by numerous manufacturers for hand loading and are much more convenient than lead casting bullets
 thuthan se lod kii jane vaali banduukon yaa blike powder ke liye bulats ko shuddh sise se dhalaai karke banaaya jaataa tha
 This worked well for low speed bullets, which were fired at speeds less than 450 m / s
 aadhunik banduukon se fire kii jane vaali thodi si zyada gati kii goliyon ke liye, sise or tin kaa ek adhik sakht mishradhatu yaa tipasetter kaa sisa behatar he
 For more high-speed bullets, jacketed bullets are used

 Lead is also cheap, it is easy to obtain, it is easy to work on, it melts at low temperatures, it is easy to use in making bullets or bullets for all these reasons
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki sisa vishaiylla hota he, jisase yah ek zyada khatarnaak hathiyaar ban jaataa he
 The 1868 Declaration of St
 Petersburg prohibited the use of explosive projectiles weighing less than 400 grams
 hegg kanvension virdohi paksh ke vardidhari sainya karmiyon ke khilaaf vardidhari sainya karmiyon ke dwaara vishesh prakaar ke barood ke upyog ko nishiddh karata he
 These include projectiles that explode within an individual, specific, and expanding bullet
 geneva sammelnon se sambandhit, vishesh paaramparik hathiyaaron par 1983 ke sammelan ke protocol III main, nagarikon ke khilaaf aag lagane vaale barood ke upyog ko nishiddh kiya gaya
 In these treaties, no one prohibits tracer or speaks of prohibited bullets in military equipment
 ye sandhiyaan yahan tak ki pistal, rifl or mashin gan main prayukt 
22 LR bulats par bhi lagu hoti hai
 Therefore, special bullets were developed during World War II for the high standard HDM pistol, a 
22 LR suppressed pistol, using bullets with full metal jackets instead of hollow point bullets, which
 22 were suitable for LR rounds
