 It is a branch of behavioral psychology that strives to improve teaching and learning
 shiksha manovigyaan vah vidhayak vigyaan he jo shiksha kii samasyaon kaa vivechan, vishleshan evam samaadhaan karata he
 Education has never been separate from psychology
 manovigyaan chaahe darshan ke rup main rahaa ho, usne shiksha ke madhyam se vyakti kaa vikaas karne main sahaayta kii he
 According to naveen binwal: education psychology studies human behavior in educational situations
 shiksha manovigyaan apana arth shiksha se, jo saamaajik prakriya he or manovigyaan se, jo vyavhaar sambandhi vigyaan he, grahan karata he
 According to Amit kumar: Education psychology describes and explains the learning experiences of a person from birth to old age
 Manzoor ahmad ke anusaar : shiksha manovigyaan vyaavhaarik manovigyaan kii vah shakha he jo shiksha main manovaigyanik siddhanto tathaa khojon ke prayog ke saath hi shiksha kii samasyaon ke manovaigyanik adhyan se sambandhit he
 According to lala ji: educational psychology represents the application of scientifically derived theories influencing the teaching and learning of human responses
 bharat main main shiksha kaa arth gyaan se lagaaya jaataa he
 According to Gandhiji, education refers to the proper development of one's body, mind and soul
 shiksha manovigyaan ke arth kaa vishleshan karne ke liye skinner ne adholikhit tathyon kii ore sanket kiya haih- Callie has stated the need for education psychology as follows: - shiksha manovigyaan ke kshetra ke bare main skinner ne likhaa he ki shiksha manovigyaan ke kshetra main vah sabhi gyaan tathaa pravidhiyaan se sambandhit he jo seekhney kii prakriya ko acchhee prakaar se samajhane tathaa adhik nipunata se nirdhaarit karne se sambandhit hai
 According to modern education psychologists, the main areas of education psychology are as follows: shiksha kii mahatvapurn samasyaon ke samaadhaan main manovigyaan sahaayak hota he or yahi sab samasyaayein va unka samaadhaan shiksha manovigyaan kaa kaaryakshetra banate hai - Kelly has analyzed the functions of education psychology as follows - shiksha manovigyaan kaa sambandh seekhney evam seekhney kii vidhiyon arthath padhaane se he
 Education and psychology are two clear branches of knowledge, but both of them are closely related
 The basis of modern education is psychology
 bachche ko uski ruchiyon, rujhaanon, sambhaawanaaon tathaa vyaktitv kaa dhyanpurvak adhyayan karke shiksha di jaati he
 Today education and psychology complement each other
 skinner skinner kaa mat he ki ‘‘shiksha manovigyaan shiksha kaa ek aavashyaktatv he
 Education cannot be solved without its help
 shiksha tathaa manovigyaan donon kaa sambandh vyavhaar ke saath he
 Psychological discoveries have a deep impact on other aspects of education
 ’’ Education and psychology is the coordination of theory and practice, knowledge of mutual relationship between education and psychology is necessary for the coordinated balanced development of human beings
 shiksha ke samaan kaary, manovigyaan k siddhanton par aadhaarit he
 According to Crow and Crow, "psychology is the science of human behavior occurring in contact with the environment"
 Psychology describes human development related to learning
 shiksha, seekhney kii prakriya ko karne kii cheshtaa pradaan karti he
 Education psychology is related to the why and when of learning
 ’’ The link connecting education and psychology is "human behavior"
 is sambandh main do vidwaanon ke vichaar drushtavy he :- Brown- "education is the process by which a person's behavior changes
" ’’ Pillsbury- "psychology is the science of human behavior
 ’’ It is clear from these definitions that both education and psychology are related to human behavior
 shiksha maanav vyavhaar main parivartan karke use uttam banaati he
 Psychology studies human behavior
 is prakaar shiksha or manovigyaan ke sambandh hona swaabhaavik he par is sambandh main manovigyaan ko aadhaar pradaan karata he
 Education has to get the approval of psychology for each of its functions
 bi
en
 jha ne thik hi likhaa he- ‘‘shiksha jo kuch karti he or jis prakaar vah kiya jaataa he uske liye ise manovaigyanik khojon par nirbhar hona padataa he
 '' manovigyaan ko yah sthaan isliye praapt hua he kyonki usne shiksha ke sab kshetron ko prabhavit karke unamem krantikari parivartan kar diya he
 In this context, these pithy sentences of Ryan are notable - yah sab shiksha manovigyaan ke upyog ke kaaran sambhav hua he
 In short, psychology has made the following contribution in the field of education- shiksha kii samasyaayein uske uddeshyon, vishay vastu, sadhano evam vidhiyon se sambandhit he
 Psychology helps in solving problems in these four areas
 manovigyaan shiksha ke uddeshyon ko acchhee tarah se samajhane main nimna prakaar sahaayta pradaan karata he
 Psychology plays an important role in understanding the content of education and determining it according to the development of the student
 kis kaksha ke chaatro ke liye vishaywastu kya ho? apratyaksh paathyakram kis prakaar kaa ho jisase chaatro ke maansik swasthya par vipareet prabhaav na pade aadi mahatvapurn prashnon kaa samaadhaan manovigyaan karata he
 With the help of psychology, mankind can be used for the welfare of the world
 manovigyaan shiksha ke sadhano ko samajhane main sahyog pradaan karata he, kyonki- Psychology gives knowledge about the methods of teaching in three ways - davis ne shiksha manovigyaan ke mahatv kii is prakaar vivechna kii he - manovigyaan ne chaatro kii abhikshmataaon evam unamem paae jane vaale vibhinnataaon kaa vishleshan karke shiksha ke kshetra main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 It has also contributed to the school years by imparting knowledge about the manner of growth and development of the student
 blair ne shiksha manovigyaan ke mahatv ko nimna shabdon main bataaya he - Different authors have given different definitions of education psychology
 isliye shiksha manovigyaan ke kshetra ke bare main nishchit taur par kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 In addition, education psychological is a new and growing science
 iske kshetra anishchit he or dharanaen gupt he
 a lot of research is being done in its fields right now and it is possible that new concepts, rules and principles of education psychology will be obtained
 iskaa bhav yah he ki shiksha manovigyaan kaa kshetra or samasyaayein anishchit tathaa parivartansheel he
 Whatever be the following areas or problems can be included in the field of education psychology
 kro and kro- ‘‘shiksha manovigyaan kii vishay saamagree kaa sambandh seekhney ko prabhavit karne vaali dashaon se he
 '' shiksha manovigyaan ko vyavhaarik vigyaan kii shrenee main rakhaa jane laga he
 Being a science, many methods developed in its study as well
 ye vidhiyaan vaigyanik hai
 In the words of George A
 Lundberg - shiksha manovigyaan main adhyayan or anusandhan ke liye saamaanya rup se jin vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he unako do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa haih- Some of these major methods are described as follows: - aatm nirikshan vidhi ko arntadarshan, anternirikshan vidhi bhi kehete he
 According to Stout, "the systematic study of one's mental activities is called internal inspection
" ’’ woodworth ne is vidhi ko aatmanirikshan kaha he
 In this method, one's mental actions are subjective
 aatmagat hone ke kaaran aatmanirikshan yaa antardarshan vidhi adhik upyogi hoti he
 According to Locke - the inspection of one's own actions by the brain
 vyakti adhyayan vidhi kaa prayog manovaigyanikon dwaara maansik rogiyon, aparaadhiyon evam samaaj virdohi kaary karne vaale vyaktiyon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Often a psychologist is brought up by many types of people
 inamen koi apradhi, koi maansik rogi, koi jhagadaaloo, koi samaaj virdohi kaary karne vaala or koi samasya balak hota he
 The psychological, physical, family and social environment of a person leads to mental imbalance
 jiske falswaroop vah avaanchhneeya vyavhaar karne lagata he
 To find out the real reason for this, he connects the episodes of a person's prior history
 is uddeshy se vah vyakti uske mata pita, shikshakon, sambandhiyon, padosiyon, mitron aadi se bhent karke poochtacha karata he
 In this way, he collects facts regarding a person's inheritance, family and social environment, interests, actions, physical health, educational and emotional development, which leads to inappropriate conduct as a victim of psychosis
 is prakaar is vidhi kaa uddeshy vyakti ke kisi vishisht vyavhaar ke kaaran kii khoj karnaa he
 Crowe and Crowe wrote, "the main purpose of the life history method is to diagnose a cause
" ’’ The extrusion method is also called the observation or inspection method
 avlokan yaa nirikshan kaa saamaanya arth he- dhyanpurvak dekhnaa
 We can estimate one's inner state of mind by observing the behavior, behavior and actions, reactions etc
 from outside
 udaahranartha- yadi koi vyakti jor-jor se bol rahaa he or uske netra laal he to ham jaan sakate he ki vah krodh me he
 You can guess a person is happy to see him laughing
 nirikshan vidhi main nirikshankarta, adhyayan kiye jane vaale vyavhaar kaa nirikshan karata he or usee ke aadhaar par vah vishay ke bare main apni dharna banaata he
 Practicalists have given special importance to this method
 colesnic ke anusaar nirikshan do prakaar kaa hota he- Formal inspection is performed in controlled conditions and informal inspection is conducted in uncontrolled conditions
 inamen se anaupchaarik nirikshan, shikshak ke liye adhik upyogi he
 He gets many opportunities to observe his students' behavior in and outside the classroom
 vah is nirikshan ke aadhaar par unke vyavhaar ke pratimaano kaa gyaan praapt karke unako upyukt nirdesan de saktaa he
 According to Good and Hat - "A questionnaire is generally a method of getting answers to literal questions, in which the person has to fill in the format himself
 is vidhi main prashnon ke uttar praapt karke samasya sambandhi tathy ekatra karnaa mukhya hota he
 a questionnaire is a schematic list of written questions
 isamen sambhavit uttaron ke liye yaa to sthaan rakhaa jaataa he yaa sambhavit uttar likhe rahete hai
 " is vidhi main vyaktiyon se bhent kar ke samasya sambandhi tathy ekatrit karnaa mukhya hota he
 Through this method, knowledge of the problems and qualities of a person is obtained
 isamen do vyaktiyon main aamane-saamne maukhik vaartalap hota he, jiske dwaara vyakti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane tathaa shaareerik or maansik dashaon kaa gyaan praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 In the words of Good and Hat - a serious conversation with an objective is the interview
 ‘‘purv nirdhaarit dashaon main maanav vyavhaar kaa adhyayan
 In the method, the user studies the behavior of a person in situations or environments they have set themselves or collects facts in relation to a problem
 ‘‘vyakti ke achetan man kaa adhyayan karke upachaar karnaa
 Through this method, a person's unconscious mind is studied, and information about his unquenchable desires is obtained
 taduparant un ichchhaaon kaa parishkar yaa margntikaran karke vyakti kaa upachaar kiya jaataa he or is prakaar iske vyavhaar ko uttam banane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he See also: atypical trigeminal neuralgia triprishthi tantrikashul, tik dulurex ek tantrikavikruti vikaar he jise chehre main hone vaale atyadhik dard ke prasangon dwaara abhilakshyit kiya jaataa he
 This pain arising in one or two trigeminal nerves can be felt on one side of the face and simultaneously in any or all of them: ears, eyes, lips, nose, scalp, frontal, left index finger, teeth, Or jaw; It is not easy to control or fix it
 anumaan he ki 15,000 logon main ek triprishthi tantrikashul se peedit hai, haalanki lagaataar galat rog-nidaan ke kaaran vaastavik aankada kaaphi adhik ho saktaa he
 In most cases, TN symptoms begin to appear after the age of 50, although there have been some cases in which patients were at least three years old
 yah zyaadaatar mahilaon main hota he
 
 tien kii vajah se chhura ghonpane jaisaa or dimag ko sunn kar dene vaala dard hone lagata he; aisa prabhavit kshetra ke chhu jane se ho saktaa he, lekin kai rogiyon main yah dard bina kisi spasht uttejnaa ke anayas hi utpann hone lagata he
 Cold air, excessive peach sound, too much noise, such as - sound emanating from a concert or crowd, chewing and talking can worsen the condition
 yahaan tak ki muskuraane, dupatta ondhane, yaa chehre kii taraf hawa yaa bal ko mahasoos karne se bhi jo dard hota he use sahanaa bahut mushkil ho saktaa he
 Since there is usually no specific treatment response to this extreme pain, suicide is a very common reaction in these cases
 gauratlab he ki baliwood abhinayta salmaan khan ko bhi yah beemaari thi jiske liye unhone surgery karai thi
 This disorder is characterized by episodes of extreme pain that can last from a few seconds to several minutes or hours
 atyadhik dard ke prasang praveg rup main ho sakate hai
 To describe the sensation of pain, patients can describe a vigilance area on the face that is so sensitive that lime or even currents of air can cause pain again
 yah jivan style par asar daalata he kyonki khaane, baat karne, hajaamat banane or daant saafe karne jaisi aam gatividhiyon dwaara yah sakriy ho saktaa he
 It is said that people who have this pain feel pain such as electric shock, burning, pressing, crushing, bursting or firing a bullet which is difficult for them to bear
 aam taur par kisi ek jagah par uthne vaala dard ek samay main chahare ke ek taraf asar daalata he jo kai second se kuch minute tak rahata he or din bhar main saikadon baar isaki punrariti hoti he
 This pain also occurs in cycles with loosening which lasts for months or even years
 10 se 12 pratishat maamalon main dwipakshi, yaa donon taraf hone vaale dard shaamil hai
 This normally indicates problems with both trigeminal nerves as one works strictly on the left side of the face and the other on the right side
 samay ke saath dard ke baar-baar uthne kii vajah se haalat or kharaab yaa gambhir ho jaati he
 Many patients have pain in one branch of the nerves, then after years, this pain will move to other branches of the nerves
 tien ke baahar se dikhaai dene laayak sanketon ko kabhi-kabhi purushon main dekha ja saktaa he jo episod ke trigar hone se bachaane ke liye hajaamat banane ke samay apane chehre ke ek kshetra ko jaanboojhkar chhod sakate hai
 Repeated waking of pain makes the patient helpless and due to fear of getting pain, the patient may be unable to perform his normal daily deeds
 triprishthi tantrikashul kaa ek bhinnrup bhi he jise apraroopik triprishthi tantrikashul kaha jaataa he
 In some cases of atypical trigeminal neuralgia, the patient experiences severe, turbulent intermittent pain like semiconsciousness, as well as pain similar to strangulation and electric shock
 anani dard ke haal ke ek vargeekaran ke aadhaar par is bhinnrup ko aksar "triprishthi tantrikashul, prakaar 2" kaha jaataa he
 In other cases, a lot of pain, such as touching, can be felt like burning or shuddering rather than electric shock
 kabhi-kabhi yah dard bijli ke jatke kii tarah hone vaali satantrikani, ardhakapali kii tarah kaa dard or jalan yaa siharannuma dard kaa milajula rup hota he
 It may also look as if a boring pineal pain is becoming unbearable
 haal hi main kiye gaye kuch adhyayanon ke anusaar atien triprishthi tantrikashul kaa ek aarambhik vikaas ho saktaa he
 The trigeminal nerve is a mixed cranial nerve called the fifth cranial nerve that is responsible for sensory data such as tectation, thermoception, and nociception arising from the face above the jaw line; It is also responsible for the motor action of the participating muscles, ie the muscular muscles, in the act of chewing, and not in the facial expression
 is dard ke sanglakshan ke sambhavit kaarnon kii vyakhya karne ke kai siddhant maujuud hai
 It was previously believed that the nerve was compressed from the inner mouth of the skull to the outer mouth; But new pioneering research indicates that it is an enlarged blood vessel - possibly the superior cerebellar artery - and compresses or pulsates against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its combination with the pons
 is tarah kaa ek sampeedan tantrika ke surakshatmak milin aavaran ko chot pahunchaa saktaa he or tantrika kii anishchit or atisakriy kriyasheeltaa kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 As a result, the slightest stimulation of any area of the nerve working can bring back pain again and at the same time hamper the nerve's ability to turn off the pain signals after the stimulation is over
 is tarah kaa chot shaayad hi kabhi dhamneevisphar dwaara; tumor dwaara; anumastishk evam pons verolai se sambandhit kone main ek mastishkavarak jhilli puti dwaara; yaa ek dardanaak ghatana, jaise - car durghatana yaa yahaan tak ki jeebh bhedan, dwaara utpann ho saktaa he
 Most polycystic patients complain of TN, but not every TN patient complains of MS
 Only two to four percent of TN patients, especially younger patients, complain of multicollinearity, which can damage the trigeminal nerve or other related parts of the brain
 isse yah siddhant nikalataa he ki merudandiya jatil triprishthi ke nasht hone kii vajah se aisa hota he
 Similar trigeminal pain occurs in MS afflicted and relieved patients
 uttarparisarpi tantrikashul, jo daad ke baad hota he, kii vajah se isi tarah ke lakshan dikhaai de sakate hai yadi triprishthi tantrika kshatigrast ho jaae
 When there is no structural cause, this syndrome is called idiopathic
 spasht shaareerik yaa prayogshaala nidaan rahit kai paristhitiyon kii vajah se durbhagyavash tien kaa kabhi-kabhi galat rog-nidaan ho jaataa he
 Sometimes a TN sufferer may seek the help of several physicians before a strict diagnosis
 is baat ke pramaan mili hai jo triprishthi tantrikashul kaa jaldi se ilaaj or nidaan karne kii jarurat kii taraf ishaara karte hai
 People are of the view that the longer the patient is suffering from TN, the more difficult it may be to change the neural pathways associated with pain
 jin danta chikitsakon ko tien kaa andeh hota he unhen sabase sambhav roodhiwaadee tareeke se aage badhanaa chahie or unhen nishkarshan yaa anya prakriyaaon ko nishpadit karne se pehle yah sunishchit kar lenaa chahie ki daant kii sabhi sanrachanaon kaa "sachmuch" talmail ho
 Many patients cannot tolerate medicines for years and an alternative treatment is to take a medicine such as gabapentin and apply it externally

 Up to 90 percent of the success of trained hand surgery has been reported
 haalanki, yadi phir se dard uthne lagata he to kuch rogiyon ko aage kii prakriyaaon se guzarana padataa he
 Of the five surgical options, microvascular decompression, also known as the genetical procedure, is the only option aimed at determining the presumed cause of pain
 is prakriya main, shalyachikitsak khopadi ko kaan ke peeche sthit ek 25-millimetre chhidr ke madhyam se pravesh karata he
 The nerve is then examined for an invading blood vessel and when it is found, the blood vessel and nerve are separated or "decompressed" by a small pad, which is usually an inert surgery such as teflon
 Made of medical material
 safal sabit hone par emvidi prakriyaaon se sthaayee taur par dard se raahat mil saktaa he or tab bahut kam anani samvedanshoonyata rah jaati he yaa bilkul nahin rahati he
 Three other procedures use a needle or catheter that enters the space through the face where the nerve first divides into three parts
 gubbaaraa sampeedan ke rup main gyaat ek laagat prabhavi twachapraveshi shalya chikitsiya prakriya ke istemaal se utkrisht safalataa daron ke praapt hone kii khabar mili he
 This technique can prove to be helpful in treating elderly patients who cannot be surgically treated due to other health diseases or conditions

 Similar success rates have also been reported with glycerol injection and radiofrequency rhizotomy
 glissrol injection vaali prakriya ke tahat ek chhidr main ek sharaab kii tarah ke padaarth ko pravesh kiya jaataa he jo tantrika ko iske jankshan ke paas nimajjit kar detaa he
 This fluid is corrosive to the fibers of the nerve and can slightly damage the nerve, which is enough to disrupt the misguided pain signals
 ek radiophriquency rizotomi main, shalya chikitsak tantrika ke chaynik bhaag yaa bhaagon ko garm karne ke liye ek electrode kaa upyog karata he
 This procedure, if done well, can target precise areas of misleading pain stimulants and deactivate them with minimal anesthesia
 gamma nif yaa ek rekhiy twarak aadhaarit vikiran chikitsa kaa istemaal karke dard sanket sancharan ko rokane se bhi tantrika kshatigrast ho saktaa he
 No incision is involved in this process
 yah tantrika mul par hamalaa karne ke liye ekadam sateek lakshyit vikiran kaa istemaal karata he, is baar usee sthaan par chaynaatmak kshati ko nishaanaa banaata he jahaan rakt vahini sampeedan aksar paaya jaataa he
 This option is used especially for those who are not medically suited for a long-term general anesthetic, or those who are taking medications to prevent blood coagulation

 Many people suffering from TN are confined to their homes or unable to work due to recurrent pain
 mitron or parivaar ko tien dard kii atyadhik gambhirtha se waakif hona chahie or isaki seemabaddhataon ko samajhnaa chahie
 At the same time, however, the TN patient should be very active in pursuing their rehabilitation efforts

 For example, the Greeks get the support of their village residents by praying in the temple, the Egyptians do this by building different monuments and Norse fighting and hunting
 unani sabhyataa, age of kings kii sabhyataaon se bahut samaan he
 They have great guards, because they start with horsemen and can train Pegasi guards
 ve apni ikaayiyon kaa prashikshan, prashikshan shaala, dhanurvidya kendra or astabalon main karte hai

 "this criticism was tempered by saying that fans of Age of Empire don't expect an amazing campaign; and they" would, anyway, make a straightforward path to a random map of the game
 "PC Gamer called this campaign Elaborated and added: "many campaigns have been very well crafted," and "the moments of real comedy are scattered - a real delightful surprise
" However, He also found reasons for criticizing: ", regrettably, most of aom's missions suffer from a recurring, depressing problem: a serious case of 'construction-based disease'
" The reviewer described: "I know the genre The base-building is built-in, but even the most ardent fans will be shocked by its volume
 What is most disappointing is AOM ' " Age of Mythology 'AI was used by four Austrian researchers - Christoph Hermann, Helmuth Melcher, Stefan Rank and Robert Trapple - a study of the values of emotions in real-time strategy games
 According to Saar, "our interest was in knowing if the inclusion of a simple emotional model in an existing bot script would improve the playing power

 The Pirates of the Seas is a series of thrilling films directed by Gore Verbinski, written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rozio and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer
 ve usee naam ke ek walt dijani theme park sawari par aadhaarit hai or captain jaik spairo, vil turnar or elizabeth swaan kaa anusaran karte hai

 Following the unexpected success of the first film, Walt Disney Pictures reported that a composition triad was in the works
 samundar ke lutere: murde kaa khazaana teen saal baad 2006 main jari kii gai
 Its answer story proved to be very successful, breaking records worldwide on the day of its premiere
 In the end it grossed a total of $ 1,066,179,725 at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth and fastest film to reach this amount

 Disney asked Jay Wolpert to write a ride-based script, which producer Jerry Bruckheimer rejected, thinking it was "an accurate pirate film"
 Because of the information about their piracy, Stuart Biatti was brought in to rewrite the script in March 2002, and Elliot and Rozio later that same month

 Verbinski was attracted to the idea of using modern technology, which was being used to revive the style that had disappeared after the Hollywood golden era, and he remembered his childhood memories of riding, he felt That the film was an occasion to pay tribute to its "scary and funny" tone
 dep is kahani se aakarshith hue kyonki unhen yah vicitra lagi: khazaana khojane kii koshish karne ke bajaay, blike parl kaa dal apana shraap hataane ke liye use waapas karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha; or paramparaagat vidroh bhi pehle hi ho chukaa tha
 Verbinski approached Rush for the role of Barbossa, as he knew that he would play it not with an effort to complicate but with a simple villain that suited the tone of the story
 Orlando Bloom read the script after suggesting Rush, with whom he was working on Ned Kelly

 There were talks with Tom Wilkinson to play Swan Governor, but the role was passed on to Jonathan Price, who Depp considered his role model

 narak ke myth The element of ancient mythology that carries new meaning in new situations is called myth
 mithkon kaa janm hi isliye hua tha ki ve pragaitihaasik manushya ke us aghat or aatank ko kam kar saken, jo use prakruti se sahasaa alag hone par mahasoos hua tha-or myth yah kaam keval ek tarah se hi kar sakate the-swayan prakruti or devataaon kaa maanvikaran karke
 In this sense, myths reflect human isolation at the same time and also provide relief from the suffering that arises from that separation
 prakruti se abhinn hone kaa nostalgia, praathmik smriti kii kaundh, shaashvat or chirantan se punah judane kaa swapn ye bhavanaayen myth ko sambhav banane main sabase shashakt bhoomika adaa karti hai
 To be fair, myth and nothing else is a collective dream of a prehistoric man, which is quite vague, consistencyless and complex like a person's dream

 shivadhanush yaa pinaak bhagwaan shiv kaa dhanush he
 This bow is mentioned in the Hindu epic Ramayana, when Sri Rama dissolves it to conquer Janaka's daughter Sita as his wife
 ek katha ke anusaar, pinaak bhagwaan shiv kaa mul dhanush he jo vinaash yaa "pralay" ke liye upyog kiya janaa he
 According to the original Valmiki Ramayana, two bows of equal caliber were made by Lord Devendra, which he gave to Rudra and Lord Vishnu and requested him to make war with each other to find out who is powerful among them
 lekin yuddh kii shuruyaat se thik pehle akashwani hui ki yah yuddh vinaash kaa kaaran ban jayega or isliye yah yuddh roak diya gaya tha
 On the radio, Rudra threw a bow which fell to the earth, which was later called the "shivdhanju"
 prithvi par yah dhanush raja janak ke purvaj raja devarath ko mila
 It is mentioned in the Hindu epic Ramayana, when Sri Rama dissolves it to win Janaka's daughter Sita as his wife
 duusari katha ke anusaar, bhagwaan vishwakarma ne do divine dhanush taiyaar kiye
 In which one name was Sharang and the other name was Pinak
 unhone shaarang bhagwaan vishnu ko tathaa pinaak bhagwaan shiv ko diya tha 
 King Janak of Mithila had a daughter named Sita
 apane bachapan main, sita ne apni bahanon ke saath khelte samay anjaane main us mej ko uthaa liya jis par vah shivadhanush rakhaa gaya tha; jise rajya main or koi bhi nahin uthaa saktaa tha
 Janak saw this incident and decided to make this incident as a backdrop for Sita's swayamvara
 baad main, janak ne ghoshnaa kii ki jo bhi sita se vivaah karnaa chahta he use is divya dhanush uthaanaa hoga or isaki pratyancha chadhaani hogi
 Prince Rama of Ayodhya extradited this bow and married Sita
 vivaah ke baad jab unke pita dasharath ram ke saath ayodhya laut rahe the, parashuram ne unke maarg ko roka or apane guru shiv ke dhanush ko todane ke liye ram ko chunauti di
 Rama dissolved the bow
 is par dasharath ne rishi parashuram se use kshamaa karne ke liye prarthana kii lekin parashuram or bhi krodhit hue or unhone vishnu ke dhanush shaarang ko liya or ram se dhanush ko baandhne or uske saath ek dwandvayuddh ladane ke liye kaha
 Rama took Vishnu's bow Sharang, tied it, placed an arrow in it and pointed that arrow towards Parasurama
 tab ram ne parashuram se poocha ki vah tir kaa lakshya kya denge
 At this, Parashurama considers himself devoid of his mystical energy
 vah mahasoos karte hai ki ram vishnu kaa hi avatar he
 Another story about Pinak is based on the war between Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, which is described in the seventy-fifth canto of the Ramayana Balakand
 parashuram ne shaarang ko pratyanchit karne ke liye chunauti dene se pehle bhagwaan ram ko yah katha bataai
 The story goes like this - the gods wanted to test the superiority of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva to see who was the best among them
 tab unhone bhagwaan brahma se unke bich matbhed paidaa karne ke liye kaha
 In the battle, Lord Vishnu defeated Lord Shiva and the gods
 bhagwaan shiv kaa dhanush pinaak bekaar ho gaya or bhagwaan vishnu kaa dhanush shaarang prabal ho gaya
 This bow pinna was later broken by Lord Rama
 bhagwaan ram ne parashuram se shaarang ko bhi liya or ise surakshit rakhane ke liye mahaasaagar ke devtaa varun ko de diya tha
 Although references from the Puranas are still to be included, Pinak is concerned with the life of Maharishi Dadhichi, who assisted the gods in defeating Vritrasura and, on request, he ended his life with a thunderbolt from his bones
 Built which Indra used to kill the demon Vritrasura

 Every year, a glance was sent to Delhi and members of the royal family were respected: two rather lived in Lucknow after 1819 and were treated with great respect

 But after the victory of the British at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the Nawab became completely matriarch
 yuddh samaapt hone ke baad avadh ne apni kaafii zamin kho di thi
 Yet on the surface, enemies became friends, and in the British Parliament, the Nawab Wazir was praised as the chief friend of the East India Company throughout India
 kai saalon ke darmiyaan nawab thodaa thodaa kar ke apni azaadi khote gaye
 In order to pay for the security of the British army and help in the war, Awadh first gave the fort of Chunar and then the district of Benares and Ghazipur and Phi Allahabad

 From this point onwards, this dynasty turned to Calcutta instead of Delhi

 According to the treaty of 1801, the Nawab had to sacrifice his army and instead had to pay a huge cost to an army led by the British
 dakshini doaab de diya gaya or elahabaad ke baaki ilaake va anya kshetra british bharat kaa ang ban gaye
 In thirty years, Awadh gave half of his land to the British

 velesley ke paas ek or chaal bhi thi: sandhi main ek dhara thi jiske tahat prashasan pranali "aadarneey company ke adhikariyon kii salaah ke aadhaar par or unheen ke anuroop" honi chahie thi
 This stream did not seem to be harmful, but it was through this that the British finally acquired Awadh
 1819 ke baad se avadh main gatividhiyaan chalati rahagin
 After the death of Saadat Ali, his son Ghazi sat on Masnad and took the title of udd-din, which means the protector of religion

 Nasiruddin, in spite of this nature, was a very popular king and also built an astronomical center, the Tarawali Kothi, which had many delicate instruments

 His death was followed by another succession war, in which the British insisted that another son of Saadat Ali, Mohammed Ali, ascended the throne

 " waajid ali shah ke is varnan ko avadh kaa angrezon dwaara adhigrahan kii daleel ke taur par istemaal kiya gaya
 If the accusation of misconduct against Wajid Ali Shah was true, then the British were equally responsible for this
 1780 ke dashak ke baad se avadh ke prashaan or vitt kaa niyantran unke paas adhik tha
 At the same time, Awadh had become very poor due to the constant demand of money from the Nawab by the British

 Therefore it is necessary that all events are displayed in a single session
 keval aisa karne par hi sab ghatnaon kaa kram or unke bich kaa vyateet kaal ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 This era can be anyone - ancient or archaic
 is kaam ke liye aajkal adhiktar isvi san kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The last year was used for this work in our country and in Europe, in ancient times and sometimes even today, Julian period is used
 jagat ke vividh deshon or vividh kaalon main alag-alag sanwat prachlit the
 Not only this, in a huge country like India, many cultures were prevalent nowadays and also in the past
 in sab sanwaton ke prachaar kaa aarambh bhinn-bhinn kaal main hua or unke varshon kaa aarambh bhi vibhinn rituon main hota tha
 Additionally, the type of calculation of year, month and day also differed
 saamanyat: varsh kaa maan rituchakra ke tulya rakhane kaa praytn kiya jaataa tha, parantu islamic sanwat hijri ke anusaar vah keval baarah chandra maason, arthath 354 dinon kaa, varsh hota tha, jo rituchakra ke tulya nahin he
 Some years were a mixture of lunar and solar, as is practiced in many provinces of India nowadays
 isamen 12 chandra maason kaa ek varsh hota he, parantu do yaa teen varshon main ek adhimaas badhaakar varsh ke madhya maan ko rituchakra ke tulya banaaya jaataa he
 Each season-cycle-like year is also called a solar year, because its value is related to the sun
 upar hamane chandramaada kaa jo ullekh kiya he usko vastut: saura chandramaada kahana chahie, kyonki uskaa aadhaar surya or chandramaa ke saath mishra rup main he
 Till the full moon or from Amavasya to Amavasya, this lunar month is respected
 jaise varshmaan kii kalpana rituon par or maas kii kalpana chandramaa kii kalaon par ashrith he, usee prakaar din kii gananaa kii kalpana suryoday, suryaast, madhyahn athwa madhyaraatri se hui
 Generally, the mean time from one midday to the next is called a day
 jahaan chandra maas prachlit he, jaise bharat ke vibhinn pradeshon main, tithiyon se gananaa kii jaati he, jinka sambandh pradhanat: chandramaa kii kalaon ke saath he
 Thus, we see that in different regions of the world, calculations are done from different seasons, the beginning of the year also occurs in different seasons and there are different types of census and day census
 ab yadi kisi pracheen shilaalekh main hamane padhaa ki vah din amuk sanwat ke amuk maas kaa amuk din tha to prashn uthta he ki vah thik koun sa din tha
 It is often difficult to find an answer, because when that age started, what was its year-scale, and how were its months and days counted, we cannot determine the day without knowing all these things
 isliye pehle yah aavashyak he ki jagat ke bhinn-bhinn sanwaton kaa prarambh, arthath unke pratham varsh kaa aarambh kisi ek hi pramanit kiye hue sanwaton main bataaya jaae
 There have been many vows in the world from ancient times till today
 un sabakaa nirdesh ek vistrut lekh kaa vishay he
 Therefore, in the Appendix, the ancient and archaic of India will give the period of the beginning of some of the main temples

 Nowadays, generally, there are 365 days in a year and one year is 366 days in every four years
 shatabdiyon ke varshon main 4 shatabdiyon main keval ek shatabdi main 366 din hote hai
 This specific system of centuries was not there in ancient times
 1582 i

 The 365-year year is called the normal year and the 366-day year is the leap year

 The first improvement was that centenary days were arranged anew, which is prevalent nowadays
 vyavastha yah hui ki jis shatabdi ko 400 se ni:shesh vibhajit kiya ja sake vahi adhivarsh he; anya sab shatabdiyaan saamaanya varsh hai

 aryaashtangmarg mahatma buddha kii pramukh shikshaaon main se ek he jo dukhon se mukti paane evam aatm-gyaan ke saadhan ke rup main bataaya gaya he
 All the 'routes' of the Ashtanga Marg begin with the word 'samyak'
 buddha pratikon main praayah ashtaang margon ko dharmachakr ke aath tadiyon dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he
 Part of the category of buddha dharm ke anusaar, chauthe arya satya kaa arya ashtaang maarg he - dukh nirodh paane kaa rasta
 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha said that craving is the root cause of all sorrows
 trishna ke kaaran sansar kii vibhinn vastuon kii ore manushya pravrutt hota he; or jab vah unhen praapt nahin kar saktaa athwa jab ve praapt hokar bhi nasht ho jaati hai tab use du:kha hota he
 a creature who dies with craving, still takes birth from his inspiration and keeps grinding in the misery of the world
 at: trishna kaa sarvatha prahaan karne kaa jo maarg he vahi mukti kaa maarg he
 This is called grief-prevention-gamini pratipada
 bhagavan buddha ne is maarg ke aath ang bataae hai : The first two parts of this path are of Pragya and the last two are of Samadhi
 bich ke chaar sheel ke hai
 In this way, Sheel, Samadhi and Pragya become the input of the eight organs in these three
 sheel shuddh hone par hi aadhyatmik jivan main koi pravesh paa saktaa he
 Mumukshu meditates on the basis of pure modesty and avails samadhi and in samadhistha state, he is interviewed with truth
 ise pragna kehete hai, jiske udbuddha hote hi sadhak ko satta maatr ke anitya, anaam or du:khaswaroop kaa saakshaatkaar ho jaataa he
 Its ignorance is destroyed in the light of wisdom
 isse sansar kii sari trishnaayen chali jaati hai
 Veetrishna, he does not ego anywhere and happiness rises above the bond of sorrow
 is jivan ke ananthar, trishna ke na hone ke kaaran, uske phir janm grahan karne kaa koi hetu nahin rahata
 Thus, the sheela-samadhi-pragyawala route divided into eight limbs is called the Arya Ashtanga path

 Sunderkand is originally a part of Valmiki's Ramayana
 goswami tulsidas krit shri ram charit maanas tathaa anya bhashaaon ke ramayana main bhi sundarkand upasthit he
 Sunderkand describes the great work done by Hanuman
 ramayana paath main sundarkand ke paath kaa vishesh mahatv mana jaataa he
 Hanuman's Lanka departure in Sunderkand, events from Lanka Dahan to return from Lanka
 is sopan ke mukhya ghatnakram he – hanumanji kaa lanka kii ore prasthaan, vibhishana se bhent, sita se bhent karke unhen shri ram kii mudrika dena, akshay kumaar kaa vadh, lanka dahan or lanka se vaapasi
 The story of Sundarkand is different in Ramayana
 sampurna ramayana katha shriram ke gunon or unke purusharth ko darshaati he kintu sundarkand ekmaatr aisa adhyay he, jo sirf hanumanji kii shakti or vijay kaa cond he
 Hanuman departed towards Lanka

 En route, Hanuman slayed the demon that caught the shadow and entered Lanka by striking Lankini
 unki vibhishana se bhent hui
 Ravana was threatening Sita when Hanuman reached the Ashokavatika
 ravan ke jane par trijata ne sita ko santvana di
 On solitude, Hanuman met Sita and gave him the ring of Rama
 hanuman ne ashokavatika kaa vidhwans karke ravan ke putr akshay kumaar kaa vadh kar diya
 Meghnath tied Hanuman in Nagpash and took him to the assembly of Ravana
 ravan ke prashn ke uttar main hanuman ne apana parichay ram ke doot ke rup main diya
 Ravana tied a cloth immersed in oil on Hanuman's tail and set it on fire, on which Hanuman burnt Lanka
 hanuman sita ke paas pahunche
 Sita gave her Chudamani and sent them away
 ve waapas samudr paar aakar sabhi vaanron se mili or sabhi waapas sugriv ke paas chale gayi
 Ram was very pleased with Hanuman's work
 ram vaanron kii sena ke saath samudratat par pahunche
 On the other hand, Vibhishan explained to Ravana that he should not hate Rama, on which Ravana humiliated Vibhishan and drove him out of Lanka
 vibhishana ram ke sharan main aa gaya or ram ne use lanka kaa raja ghoshit kar diya
 Rama pleaded to give way to the sea

 " == aishwarya kii filmein ==hum dil de chuke sanam Suraj's seventh horse is the famous novel of Dharmaveer Bharti
 dharmaveer bharti kii is laghu aupnyasik rachana main hitopadesh or panchatantrvaali style main 7 dopahari main kahi gai kahaniyon ke rup main ek upanyaas nirmit kiya gaya he
 This book is from the Indian Jnanpith ise laghu upanyaas kii sangya di gayi he
 The texture of the plot gives a new dimension to the theme of the novel
 ‘suraj kaa satvon ghoda’ bhi bharat-iran kii pracheen shaileyon se prabhavit mana jaataa he
 But, this method of the old anecdote - aliphalla, panchatantra, dashakumarcharit or kathasaritsagara - is only the upper skin of the 'seventh horse of the sun', it cannot be considered the basic structure of the plot
 ek duusari style bhi isamen parilakshith kii ja sakati he- vah he, virgthaon yaa anya mahakavyon jaisi style, jisamen rachanaakaar apni rachanaaon kaa rachayita hi nahin varan ghatnaon ke bich swayan bhi upasthit he
 He is both a bhakta and an author
 is prakaar rachana tatasth hone, nijee anubhuti ko saarvajanik anubhav main tabdeel karne kaa daayitv ban jaati he
 Chandavaradayi, the author of 'prithviraj Raso', is also its important character, just as Valmiki and Tulsi present themselves in their compositions or that Sanjay is present in the Mahabharata event
 ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ ke kisse maanik mullah sunaate hai, lekin ve in kahaniyon ke vaktaa maatr hi nahin – ve inke bich badi shiddat se maujuud hai
 He is also the bearer of these stories, just like Valmiki, Sanjay and Chand
 kaha jaataa he ki ‘raso’ ko chandvardaayi ne puraa na kar yah kaam apane bete jalhan ko saunp diya tha
 The last excerpts of 'raso' are written by him, similarly there are stories of 'seventh horse of the sun' narrated by Manik Mulla, but presents him as a listener 'I'
 ‘main’ hi iskaa mul lekhak he lekin vah ramcharita maanas ke tulsi kii tarah, jo ramakatha ke shiv-parvati samvaad ke prastota maatr ban jate hai- hamaare saamne aata he
 He tells of the stories narrated by Manik that “finally i also want to make it clear that whatever is good and evil in the subject matter of this short novel is not on me but on Manik Mulla
 maine sirf apane dhang se vah katha aapke saamne rakh di he’’
 This writer-presenter is also present in the story in a minor capacity - as a listener
 rachana or rachanaakaar bhartiya parampara main sahaj awajahi karte rahe hai
 This novel also allows the narrative and narrator's likeness to be possible in the texture of its plot
 yatharth or kalpana ek duusare ke poorak hone lagate hai
 If it is said that the middle class is half-real and half-dreamed, then it will not be wrong
 srijan ke liye bhi kalpana or hakeekat kaa sanyog ek anivaary sthiti he
 Therefore, the middle class is the most creative, dreamy and change oriented
 ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ isi madhyavarg kii daastaan – uski antarvirohi sthitiyon ke saath – hamaare saamne prastut karata he
 The plot of this creation is woven into a new genre
 shuruuaat upodghaat se hui he
 Upadhuga means prelude, role
 mukhya katha-adhyyon ke bich main chaar anadhyaay bhi jode gaye hai
 Apart from these, the entire story is divided into seven afternoons
 saat dopaher kii katha maanik mullah kii he or upodghaat samet chaar anadhyaay unke shrota ‘main’ kii tippaniyan hai
 This tale, divided into twelve parts in total, sheds light on the life of the leading characters - Jamuna, Lily and Satti - who came in contact with Manik Mulla
 saath hi, yah bhi pataa chalata he ki in paatro se jude sandarbhon par maanik mullah ke shrotaaon kii pratikriya kisi thi
 This novel takes shape with these mixed events
 upodghaat main hamen maanik mullah ke vyaktitv, unki abhiruchiyon, kisse gadhane kii unki kshamta or unako sunaane ke andaaj ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 Here we also get to know that, "if there is enough time, the whole house is in the right, four friends are sitting, then it is certain that the talks will turn on politics and when the interest in politics ends, then the meeting The dialogue will rest on 'love'
 lekin jahaan tak saahitiyik vaarta kaa prashn tha, ve prem ko tarjeeh diya karte the
 These statements reveal which are the necessary tools for novel writing
 ve hai- fursat kaa samay, aise log jo swayan fursat main hon or ise kaatane ke liye kisson kaa sahaara chaah rahe hon, aisi jagah jahaan bahari vyavdhaan na ho
 Politics, love and literature can be natural subjects of a novel
 ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ kii rachana inhen upkarnon ke sahare hoti he
 Therefore, this work is composed from personal contexts, ignoring the vast social questions
 ise mahakavyatmak upanyaas kii shrenee main na rakhkar laghu upanyaas kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya he
 Instead of establishing the ideal, the inauguration of reality is at its center
 yah yatharth bhi apni samvednaa or bhavbhumi main laghutaa ko hi, rosemara kii aam ghatnaon ko hi adhik ubharta he
 All the characters, including Manik Mulla, are an average character, they are so overwhelmed by their daily events that they try to examine the country, the world and society with their personal eyes
 isiilie bade saamaajik darshan kii ek ridusd samaj unki banati he
 Girija Kumar Mathur has divided the composition of 'the seventh horse of the sun' into three stories
 ‘pratham kathavritt kaa centre maanik mullah he
 Satellites of Jamuna, Lily and Tanna centers
 duusare katha-vrutt kaa centre bhi maanik mullah he, sati, mahesar or chaman singh centre ke upgrah
 The third is the story of 'I', on one side of which is a satirical depiction of Marxist principles and on the other side the individualistic art-aspects
 yah vrutt gaun he
 Girija Kumar Mathur further commented on its craft features, commenting that, "in Anadhyay, 'I' has analyzed the character of everyone in one way or the other, but he is so fascinated with Manik Mulla that his balanced analysis anywhere He has not let it happen
 arthath kahani rachane vaala ‘main’ naamak jo shrota he, vah upanyaas ke bheetar daawa to yah karata he ki main maanik katha ko jyon-kaa-tyon prastut kar rahaa hoon or technic samet baaki sabhi vastuon ke liye usne maanik mullah ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya he, lekin vah tatasth nahin rah sakaa
 In the composition of this novel, like Prakash's view about Manik, "ho na ho Manik Mulla also has some obsession towards women like other Hindi storytellers
 ” kuch aisa hi obseshan ‘main’ kaa maanik ke prati he
 He is overwhelmed by Manik's unique personality and determined to save his stories
 is anany shrota ‘main’ ne nishchit hi in kahaniyon ko mahatvapurn mana he, isiilie maanik mullah ke laapata hone par unhen bachaane kii disha main kalambaddh kiya he
 Therefore, 'I' cannot be considered a neutral presenter of Manik Mulla's stories, but 'I' and Manik are mostly one and not the same person
 isiilie maathur tisare vrutt ko gaun maanate hai
