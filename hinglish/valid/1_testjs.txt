 As we know his father was a pastor and had a large number of members in the household when he was a householder with earnings, his mother was a homemaker and he took care of his family's ancestral farm and his small time in the small household The devices were made and we can say that Tasla's interest in the invention of electricity inspired his mother
 jab ek baar nicola apane bade bhai ke saath jhul rahaa tha, to unke bade bhai dainil apni aankhon ke saamne jhukate hue jhule se girte hue mar jate the
 The incident destabilized the eight-year-old Nicola, due to which his mental balance was bad throughout his life, and due to which he also used to have bad dreams

 One day while Nicola working in the office, Edison came there and Nicola noticed that he was worried about something, he asked Edison to explain the cause of the problem, Addison jokingly told Nicola, if you If you improve the design, you make DC Dynamos, you give $ 5 xxrep 4 0 
 At that time there was a huge amount of $ 50,000, which is equivalent to today's $ 25,000,000
 Nicola felt it was a good opportunity, And he began to improve the design and they day and made a night and he began to work 19 hours to complete the project and complete it within a few days
 " lekin jab unhone edison ko paise dene ke liye kaha, to edison ne kaha, "testla, aap hamaare american hasya ko samajhane main sakasham nahin hai
 "nicola became very frustrated with this and broke her heart and after that she left Edison's company and after an unsuccessful attempt to start her own Tesla Electric Light Company, and started working for the excavator in two days Granted, some people did not listen to their supporters to support their researchers, but in 1887 and 1888, there were more than 30 patents for their inventions, which were in Radon and Electrical engineers were invited to work on their work on the Merican Institute

 vitt main, poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model kaa upyog kisi poonjigat parisampatti ke liye saidhantik rup se upyukt vaanchit pratilabh dar gyaat karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jab is parisampatti ko ek pehle se hi suvishakheekrut sanvibhag main joda janaa ho, tathaa jabaki us parisampatti kaa ashaakhneey jokhim gyaat ho
 In this model the intractable risk of the asset, which is often represented by 'beta' in the finance sector, is taken into account and also the expected return on the market and the expected return on the theoretical risk-free asset
 siepiem kaa suzav he ki kisi niveshak kii share poonji kii laagat kaa nirdhaaran 'beta' se hota he
 ”: 2 The broad form of this model is the bi-beta model, which distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta

 CAPM is a model for pricing a single asset or group of assets
 akeli pratibhuti ke liye, ham pratibhuti bazaar rekha tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh va systematic jokhim ke saath uske sambandh kaa prayog yah jaanane ke liye karte hai ki bazaar ke dwaara kisi ek pratibhuti kii keemat uski jokhimshrenee kii tulana main kitni nirdhaarit hogi
 The yield-risk ratio can also be calculated from the securities market line compared to the entire market of a single asset
 atah jaise jaise kisi sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratilabh uske beta kofishent dwaara ghatata chalaa jayega, is akeli sampatti kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat, sampurna bazaar ke pratifal-jokhim anupaat ke baraabar hota chalaa jayega
 Like this: bazaar kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat hi prabhavi taur par bazaar jokhim adhimulya / premium he or uparokt sameekaran ko punah niyojan karne par tathaa e kaa maan nikaalane par, hamen poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model praapt ho jaataa he
 Where: yadi isi ko jokhim premium ke drushtikon se punarlekith kiya jaae, to ham pate hai ki: That is, the "own risk premium" of an asset - the product of "market risk premium" and "beta"
 note 1: bazaar ke pratyaashit pratifal kaa anumaan praayah kisi bazaar-portpholio ke aitihaasik pratifalon ke maan kaa gyometric ausat nikaalkar lagaaya jaataa he
 Note 2: The 'risk-free rate of return' used to calculate risk is often the arithmetic average of historical rates and not the current rate
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 The CPM can be modified to include size overload and specific risk
 yah un niveshkon ke liye mahatvapurn he jinke paas ek unnat-vishakhit portpholio nahin he
 The equation is very similar to the traditional CAPM equation "in which market risk weighting is replaced by multiplication of beta product and market risk weighting:": 5 "jahaan: The securities market line depicts the CPM formula as a graph
 x aksh par jokhim ko dikhaate hai or y aksh par pratyaashit pratilabh
 Market risk is estimated by the slope of the securities market line
 β tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh ke madhya sambandh kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha par kiya jaataa he, jo ki pratyaashit pratilabh ko β ke falan ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available in the market, while the slope is the market premium, E− Rf
 esa kaha ja saktaa he ki pratibhuti bazaar rekha as representing a single-factor model of the asset price ko dikhaati he, jabaki β se pataa chalata he ki uski bazaar main parivartanon se prabhavit hone kii sambhaavna kitni he is prakaar SML kaa sameekaran is prakaar he: It is a very important tool in such situations when it is to find out whether a asset / security will give an acceptable return compared to the risk
 akeli parisampattiyon kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha graph par kiya jaataa he
 If the mutual depiction of risk and return is above the line, it means that the security is getting cheaper and more profit can be expected on it
 yadi chithran rekha se neeche aa pade to mulya ko manhagaa samajha janaa chahie tathaa isamen utana laabh nahin milegaa jitna ki jokhim uthaaya ja rahaa he
 After knowing the expected / desired profit rate e { \ displaystyle E} using CAPM, it can be compared to the expected return rate of the asset to determine whether the investment is good or not
 iske liye hamen sampatti ke pratilabh ke swatantra anumaan kii gananaa kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo ki praayah fundamental athwa technical vishleshan, anupatik vishleshan aadi ke dwaara kii jaati he
 According to CAMP, if the estimated value is equal to the future cashflow adjusted with the rate suggested by the asset's CAPM - then the asset is meeting at the right price
 yadi anumaanit mulya siepiem moolyankan se adhik he to sampatti sasti he 
 An asset not located on the securities market line indicates a discrepancy in its value
 chunki samaybindu t { \ displaystyle t} par sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratifal e = e − p t p t { \ displaystyle E={ \ frac {e-p_{t}}{p_{t xxrep 4 } jo ki siepim dwaara sujhaaye pratifal se adhik he, to iskaa arth he ki p t { \ displaystyle P_{t}} bahut kam he, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t+1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 Using CAPM, the value of the asset p 0 { \ displaystyle P_ {0}}, can be displayed with the following linear relation: jahaan p t { \ displaystyle P_{T}} sampatti yaa portpholio kaa payoff he
 It can be found out by the CAMP that what should be the expected return ie adjustment rate, taking into account the relative risk of a particular asset
 yadi beta kaa maan ek se adhik ho to iskaa arth he - ausat se adhik jokhim; ek se kam kaa arth he - ausat se kam jokhim
 Thus, a higher risk stock will have a higher beta and will be adjusted at a higher rate
 jabaki kam samvedansheel stox kaa beta kam hoga or unhen kam dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 This is in line with the prevailing informal assumption that high risk-taking investors desire higher returns
 kyonki beta kisi ek parisampatti ke jokhim kii puure bazaar jokhim ke prati samvedansheeltaa kaa paimaana he, to paribhaasha se spasht he ki bazaar jokhim kaa beta kaa maap hoga : 1
 The stock market index is used extensively as a complementary measure to measure market risk, hence its beta measure is 1
 is prakaar, ek bade or suvishakhit portpholio ke niveshak apane nivesh se bazaar kii chaal ke anusaar hi parinaamon kii apeksha kar sakate hai
 The risk in any portfolio is primarily the sum of two types of risk - systemic risk, also known as market risk or non-intangible risk, and disorderly risk known as branchial risk
 vyavasthaatmak yaa bazaar jokhim un kaarnon kii vajah se hota he jo samast nivesh vikalpon arthath puure bazaar ko prabhavit karte he
 This type of risk is difficult to control
 avyavashthaatmak jokhim vah jokhim he jo kisi vishesh pratibhuti athwa nivesh vikalp ko prabhavit karata he
 Such risk can be controlled by diversifying the investment
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i
e
 its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness—as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i
e
 less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 CAPM assumes that the risk-return ratio of an investment can be corrected, an ideal portfolio would be one with minimal risk to a defined return rate
 iske atirikt, kyonki portpholio main judane vaali har nai sampatti portpholio kaa or vishaakhan karti he, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above 
 All such optimal portfolios, i

 In this way it is possible that a certain return can be achieved by any one of the following types: haalaanki ek nishchit pratilabh ke liye, uparokt main se koi ek vikalp hi kushal siddh hoga 
 Since the risk-free asset is not necessarily correlated with any other asset, the second option will usually have less deviation, which would make it more efficient of the two
 yah sambandh prabhavi seemaa par sthit anya portpholios ke liye bhi sahi hoga : ucch pratilabh ke saath kuch nakad- adhik kushal he bajaay - usee pratilabh dar par maatr nimna pratilabh vaale portpholio ke
 For a fixed risk-free rate, there will be only one efficient portfolio that can be combined with cash to achieve a minimum risk position for any return
 yahi market portpholio he

 azo yogic aise carbonic yogic ko kehete hai jisamen R-N=N-R' samooh ho jisamen r or R' aril yaa alkil ho sakate hai
 The word 'aijo' comes from the French language 'azote' which means nitrogen
 azo-benazin sabase saral azo yogic he
 It is formed by denaturing nitrobenzene with zinc and alkali, sodium mercury alloys and dilute alcohols or alkaline stannous hydroxide solutions: tulya maatra ke arometic primary amin or nitroso yogic ko sandra aseetic amla ke saath garam karne par azo yogic banate hai or pani mukt hota he : Azo compounds are most commonly formed by adding di azonium salts to primary, secondary and tertiary amines, phenols, or phenolic esters
 is kriya main pehle daai-azonium lavan primary or secondary arometic amin se pratikriya kar daai-azoamino yogic banaate hai: The nitrous acid is reacted on the aniline base in the presence of less mineral acid to form a di-azoamino compound
 daai-azoamino yogic pile rang ke mand kshareey gunwale manibh yogic hai jo amlon se sanyog karte hai, parantu tanba, chaandi or potacium ke lavan bhi banaate hai jinamein nitrogen se sabanddh yah hydrogen chal prakruti kaa hota he or yah ek nitrogen parmaanu se duusare nitrogen parmaanu par ja saktaa he
 The proof of this is that if phenol azonium salts are added to toluidine or tolyl di-azonium salts are added to aniline, the same compound is formed in both cases, otherwise the compound of the formula is formed in the first combination and the compound of the formula in the second combination
 Received: vaastavik bane yogic kaa sutara hota he jisamen adhik dhaneey carbonic tolil mulak amino samooh se sambhddha hota he
 The di-azoamino compounds are converted to amino-azo compounds upon heating the organic alkali with hydrochloride or in the presence of more mineral acids
 yah parivartan paara sthiti se hota he, parantu yadi yahan koi mulak upasthit hua to yah aadan pradaan ortho sthiti se hota he
 Many amino azo dyes are made by this action
 tershiri arometic amin daai-azonium lavan se sangog karte hai or amino-azo-yogic pratyaksh banate hai, jinamein azo samooh tershiri amino samooh ke paara sthaan main judaa rahata he
 Hydroxy azo compounds are formed by the addition of di-anzonium salts to alkaline solutions of phenol
 is kriya main praaia: daai-azoaksaide banataa he
 The strength of phenolic ester to bind to di-anzonium salts is lower than that of amine and phenol
 is kriya ke liye yah aavashyak he ki kriya nirjal sthiti main kii jaae
 Therefore, this action is usually done in concentrated acetic acid
 butad-in jaise asantrupt hydrocarbon or misitelin se nitroeenileen ke daai-azonium yogic sanyog karte hai
 Misetylene combines with dicazonium salts of pricramide and forms an asterisk
 daai-azonium lavan kaa napthol or napthil amin se sanyog vishesh mahatvapurn he
 The alfra-naphthol attaches to the mercury location of the hydroxy group, but if a group is present at this location, it is coincident with the ortho location
 beta-napthol main azo mulak 1 sthaan grahan karata he
 a similar combination occurs in beta-naphthalene
 daai-azo-ammonium lavan amino-hydraxi-amin se kshareey vilyan main hydraxi samooh se judata he, parantu amleey vilyan main yah sanyog amino samooh se hota he
 In this way different types of dyes can be made by making the solution alkaline or acidic with the same amino-naphthol: siddhantanusaar azo yogicon ke sis, trans, do samaavyavi rup hone chahie
 There is not much research yet on this type of isomers
 transazo benazin par prakaash daalane par yah sis-rup main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The alternation and absorption coefficient of Sis isomorphic is different from that of trans isomers
 prakaash ke prabhaav se santulan kii sthiti utpann ho jaati he, jisamen lagbhag 27 pratishat sis- or 73 pratishat trans-samaavyavi rahete hai
 There are two types of azo dyes
 ek ko kshareey ranjak or duusare ko amleey ranjak kehete hai
 In alkaline pigments, aniline yellow, Bismarck brown, Janus red, etc
 are prominent
 anillin yalo kaa rasinic naam paara-amino azobenzin he
 It is a yellow pigment, which turns purple in acid
 bismark brown meta-fenileen-diamin par nitras amla kii kriya dwaara banaaya jaataa he
 This dye is used in dyeing leather
 jenus red ranjak rui or oon ko amleey usmak main rangata he
 It is used in dyeing cotton and wool mixed with wool and silk
 amleey ranjakon main methil orange, elfaa -napthol orange, fast red e or bi, napthil-amin blike di, victoria vilet ityadi pramukh ranjak hai
 । carbon ke rasinic yogicon ko carbonic yogic kehete hai
 Their number in nature is more than 1 million
 jivan paddati main carbonic yogicon kii bahut hi mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 These contain carbon as well as hydrogen
 aitihaasik tathaa parampara gat kaarnon se kuch carbon ke yogakon ko carbonic yogicon kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 These mainly include carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
 sabhi jaev anu jaise carbohydrate, amino amla, protein, arene tathaa diene carbonic yogic hi hai
 Compounds of carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons
 methen sabase chote anusutra kaa hydrocarbon he
 Ethane, propane, etc
 are followed by which one carbon is added respectively
 hydrocarbon teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai: ethane shrenee, ethilin shrenee or asitilin shrenee
 Ethane-grade hydrocarbons are saturated, ie, the amount of hydrogen in them cannot be increased further
 ethilin main do carbonon ke bich main ek dwibandh he, asitilin main trigun bandh vaale yogic asthaayee hai
 It can easily get oxidised and halogenated
 hydrocarbonon ke bahut se vyutpann taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai, jinke vividh upyog hai
 Such derivatives are chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohol, sodium alkoxide, amine, mercaptan, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen sulfate
 asatrupt hydrocarbon adhik sakriy hota he or anek abhikaarakon se sanyukt ha saralata se vyutpann banaata he
 Many such derivatives have proved to be of great importance from an industrial point of view
 inase anek bahumoolya vilaayak, plastic, kriminashak oshadhiyaan aadi praapt hui hai
 The oxidation of hydrocarbons gives alcohol ether, ketones, aldehydes, fatty acids, esters, etc
 alcodaul praathmik, dwitiyak or tritiyak ho sakate hai
 Their ester fluids are aromatic
 anek sugandhit dravya inase taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Similarly the azo compound can also be taken in various experiments

 pracheen kaal main sara vyavasthit chintan darshan ke antargat hota tha, atah sari vidyaayein darshan ke vichaar kshetra main aati thi
 Different aspects of politics are studied under political theory
 raajnneeti kaa sambandh manushyon ke saarvajanik jivan se hai
 In traditional studies, thinking was the predominance of the method of thinking in which not all the elements are monitored, but on the basis of reasoning power, all its possible aspects, mutual relations effects and consequences are considered
 'siddhanth' kaa arth he tarkpurna dhang se sanchit or vishleshit gyaan kaa samooh
 Politics is concerned with many things, including the relationship between individuals and groups and classes and the state, and the institutions of the state like judiciary, bureaucracy etc
 raajnneetik siddhanth kii paribhaasha karte hue david veld kehete hai- Political theory according to Andrew Hacker's definition - guld or colb ne raajnneetik siddhanth kii ek vyapak paribhaasha karte hue kaha he ki 'raajnneetik siddhanth raajnneeti vigyaan kaa ek up-kshetra’ he, ‘jisamen nimnlikhit kaa samavesh haih We can conclude that political theory is basically concerned with the mobilization of the state in both philosophical and empirical terms
 rajya tathaa raajnneetik sansthaaon ke bare main spashtikaran dene, unka varnan karne or unke sambandh main shreyaskar suzav dene kii koshish kii jaati he
 Of course, the study of moral philosophical purpose is embedded in it
 chintak vinstin ne gaagar main sagar bharte hue kaha tha ki raajnneetik siddhanth mukhyatah ek aisi sankriya he jisamen prashn puche jate hai, un prashnon ke uttaron kaa vikaas kiya jaataa he or maanav praaniyon ke saarvajanik jivan ke sambandh main kaalpanik pariprekshyon kii rachana kii jaati he
 The questions that are asked are as follows: What is the nature and purpose of the state? How do we decide the goals, goals and methods of political organization? What is and should be the relationship between the state and the individual? Throughout history, political theory has been answering these questions
 ise isliye mahatvapurn mana gaya he kyonki manushya kaa bhagya is baat par nirbhar hota he ki shaskaon or shasiton ko kis prakaar kii pranali praapt ho paati he or jo pranali praapt hoti he uske falswaroop kya saamaanya bhalaai ke liye sanyukt kaarywahi kii jaati he
 Philosophy consists of all the thinking on any subject in search of truth and knowledge
 jab vah khoj raajnneetik vishyon par hoti he tab use ham raajnneetik darshan kehete hai
 Therefore, there is no need to propose any theory in it and this is the difference between political philosophy and political theory
 is prakaar raajnneetik siddhanth raajnneetik darshan kaa hissaa he, lekin raajnneetik darshan adhikanshtah kaaphi adhik vyapak hota he or aavashyak nahin ki usamen koi siddhanth shaamil ho
 Thus we can say that the questions related to political philosophy state, government, politics, freedom, justice, property, rights, law and the enforcement of legal code by any authority, etc
, ie what are they? If they are needed then why? What things legitimize a government, what rights and freedoms it should protect and why and what form it should take and why the law is and what it is and the duty of citizens towards a legitimate government, if any What are the questions and when will the overthrow of a government be valid or not? ‘raajnneetik darshan’ se bahudhaa hamaara taatpary raajnneeti ke prati saamaanya drushtikon yaa uske sambandh main vishisht naitikta athwa vishwaas yaa rukh se hota he or yah sab jaruri taur par darshan ke sampurna takneekee vishay ke antargat nahin aata he
 Political philosophy is often concerned not with contemporary questions, but more universal questions of the political life of man
 lekin raajnneetik siddhantkaar kii drushti mukhya rup se samakaleen raajnneetik jivan par hoti he or yadhyapi rajya ke swaroop or prayojan or isi prakaar ke saamaanya prashnon kii vyakhya karne main vah dilchaspee letaa he tathaapi vah raajnneetik vyavhaar, rajya tathaa nagarikon ke bich ke vaastavik sambandh or samaaj main shakti kii bhoomika ke yathaarthon kaa varnan karne or unhen samajhane kii bhi koshish kar rahaa hota he
 While studying political science we feel that we should supplement political theory with the study of political philosophy otherwise it seems barren and irrelevant
 raajnneetik siddhanth ko kabhi-kabhi raajnneetik chintan ke paryaay ke rup main dekha jaataa he, lekin yah samaj lenaa jaruri he ki unka arth aavashyak rup se ek hi nahin hota
 Political thought is a generalized phrase that incorporates all the thoughts, principles and values of an individual or group of people or community on questions related to the state and the state
 jab koi vyaktiμchaahe vah professor, patrkaar, lekhak, kavi, upanyaaskaar aadi jo bhi ho yaa beshak vah raajnneetijna hi hoμaise vichaar vyakt karata he jinka hamaare jivan se sarokaar he or jo vichaar rajya or shashan tathaa inase sambandhit prashnon ke bare main hai tab vah vastutah raajnneetik chintan kar rahaa hota he
 Principles may or may not be included in his thoughts
 un vichaaron main tab koi siddhanth nihit nahin hoga jab un main rajya or shashan aadi ke raajnneetik niyam se sambandhit aitihaasik tathaa raajnneetik sanghatana kii vyakhya karne ke liye prastut kii gai koi vyavasthit or tarksmmat prakkalpana na ho
 In this way, political thinking is always the general idea of a person or a group politically, whereas a political theory is an explanation or idea or principle in itself and standing on its own, in which to answer questions, to interpret history
 And an attempt is made to forecast future possible events
 beshak, yah siddhanth hameshaa kisi ek chintak vyakti kii sristi hota he
 Barker had said that political thought is the inward philosophy of an entire era, but political theory is the thinking of one person
 raajnneeti vigyaan adhyayan kaa ek vistrut vishay yaa kshetra he or raajnneetik siddhanth uskaa ek up -kshetra bhar he
 Political science includes all these things: political thought, political theory, political philosophy, political ideology, institutional or structural framework, comparative politics, public administration, international law and organization etc
 kuch chintakon ne raajnneeti vigyaan ke vigyaan paksh par bal diya he
 He says that when political science is studied as a science through scientific methods, then political theory cannot be considered political science to the extent it is a part of political philosophy, because in political science, then, the abstract and intuitive There is no place for conclusions or thoughts arising out of it, but political philosophy should be filled with the same inexact methods

 raajnneetik siddhanth na to shuddh chintan he, na shuddh darshan or na shuddh vigyaan
 The questions that have been important in political theory have changed over time
 clasiki or praarambhik raajnneetik siddhanth kaa sarokaar naitik drushti se dosha-rahit raajnneetik vyavastha kii talash se tha or usne vishesh dhyaan rajya ke swaroop or prayojan, raajnneetik satta ke upyog ke aadhaar or raajnneetik avagya kii samasya se prashnon par diya
 The rise of modern nation states and the changes in the economic structure and the industrial revolution led to new priorities and the center of attention became individualism and freedom of the individual and its relationship with society and the state
 adhikaar, karttavya, swatantraaa, samanta or sampatti jaise prashn adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye
 Gradually, the interpretation of the relation of others with a concept such as freedom and equality, justice and liberty, or the relation between equality and property: also became important
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad ek nae prakaar ke anubhavik raajnneetik siddhanth kaa udai hua
 It tried to study the political behavior of man and draw theoretical conclusions on the basis of it
 maanav-vyavhaaron kaa adhyayan karne vaale vidwaanon ne adhyayan ke liye nae prashnon ko saamne rakhaa
 He often borrowed such questions from other branches of the genre
 inamen se kuch prashn is prakaar hai- Over the past few decades many other issues have emerged - such as identity, gender, environmentalism, ecology, community, etc
 saath hi mulya-aadhaarit raajnneetik siddhanth kaa bhi punaroday hua he, jisamen swatantraaa, samanta or nyaay ke prashnon par nae dhang se jor diya gaya he
 We as human beings live together as social beings, in which we partner in resources, jobs and rewards
 saath hi ham vyakti bhi hai, jis haisiyat main hamen kuch buniyadi maanavadhikaron kii jarurat he
 Therefore, the process of organization of the state and society becomes important for the sake of bringing harmony and prosperity to the maximum extent and to provide favorable conditions for personal self-improvement
 faltah maanav samaajon kii ekta or akhandta kaa yaa samaaj kii samuhik aavashyaktaaon kii purti kaa maarg prashast karne ke liye raajnneetik siddhanth mahatvapurn ho jaataa he, kyonki vah samasyaon kaa adhyayan karne or us prakriya main unka samaadhaan foundne kii koshish karata he
 The relevance of political theory in developing different perspectives on the nature and purpose of the state, in relation to the basis of political power and the most credible form of government, and in relation to the basic rights of the state and the individual
 Contains
 iske atirikt, raajnneetik siddhanth raajnneetik rajya kii naitik gunvattta kii parakh ke liye naitik maapdand sthapit karne tathaa vaikalpik raajnneetik prabandhan or vyavhaar sujhane kaa bhi praytn karata he
 In short, the relevance of political theory lies in the following: yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki kam se kam vartmaan kaal main rajya adhikadhik pariman main garibi, bhrashtachar, janaadhiky or sanjateey tathaa nasli tanaavon, paryaavaran pradooshan aadi kii chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 Apart from these, there is the problem of international differences etc
 raajnneetik siddhanth samaaj ke raajnneetik jivan kii vartmaan tathaa bhavi samasyaon kaa adhyayan karne or un samasyaon ke samaadhaan ko sujhane kaa praytn karata he
 David Heldney has said that the work of political theory is very serious because of its complexities, because in the absence of systematic study, there is a danger that politics should not remain in the hands of ignorant and selfish people as a means to satisfy their power hunger
 Go is prakaar yadi hamen samazorthik yatharth evam aadarshon tathaa raajnneetik darshan kaa dhyaan rakhte hue, rajya ke swaroop or prayojan tathaa shashan kii samasyaon par vyavasthit dhang se vichaar karnaa he to hamen samasya ke saidhantik adhyayan kaa rasta apnaanaa hoga
 Thus political theory is relevant
 saath hi vyaktigat str par raajnneetik siddhanth kaa adhyayan karne se hamen apane adhikaron tathaa karttavyon kii jaankaree milti he or garibi, hinsa, bhrashtachar aadi samazorthik yathaarthon or samasyaon ko samajhane main sahaayta milti he
 Political principles are also important because on the basis of various political principles, 'moving forward, he can suggest us ways and directions to change the society, so that an ideal society can be established
 marxvaadi siddhanth ek aise siddhanth kaa udhaaharan he jo na keval disha sujhata he balki samtawadi samaaj kii sthapana ke liye kranti kii himaayat karne kii had tak jaataa he
 If any political theory is correct then it can be communicated to the common people and then it can become a strong force to take society and mankind on the path of progress

 Equally creative in both story and novel genres

 Sanjeev was born on July 6, 1947 in village Bangar Kalan in Sultanpur district of Uttar Pradesh
 inaki ucch shiksha vigyaan vishyon ko lekar hui
 With a degree in BS-C, AIC, he worked as a chemist incharge in Indian Iron and Steel Company, Kulti from 1965 to 2003 AD

 Was editor of Aksharparva for a few months
 kareeb saal bhar tak madhav prakaashan main sampadan kaary karne ke baad rajendra yadav dwaara hans kaa kaaryakari sampadak niyukt hokar dilli main hi rahane lage
 Even after being freed from editing of 'hans', he has been living in Delhi for many years, doing independent writing
 sanjeev hindi sahitya main saathottaree daur ke baad janavaadee kathandolan ke praayah saath-saath viksit peedi ke pramukh hastakshron main se ek hai
 He has often stayed like a seeker by staying away from literary publicity centers for a long time
 unki pehali prakashit kahani 'aparnaa' thi, jo unke bagal ke shahar se prakashit honevaali laghu patrika 'parichay' main 1962 i0 main chhapi thi
 The first story to be published in a big magazine was 'kissa an agency of an insurance company'
 yah kahani 'sarika' main april 1976 main prakashit hui thi
 In both the story and novel genres, he has equally demonstrated action and efficiency
 ab tak unke 12 kahani sangrah or 10 upanyaas prakashit ho chuke hai
 Apart from these, two children's novels and some other compositions are also published
 kahani evam upanyaas donon vidhaon main to anek lekhakon ne likhaa he, parantu donon main samaan kriyasheeltaa tathaa samaan uplabdhi durlabh rahi he
 If someone's storyteller form remains dominant, then someone's novelist form
 acharya nishantaketu ne in donon vidhaon main samaan siddhi evam prasiddhi ke prasang main anek logon kii charchaa karte hue premachand evam jainendra kumaar ke sandarbh main likhaa he ki ab aalochak is nishkarsh par pahunch chuke hai or jisaki charchaa hoti he ki ye donon rachanaakaar kahani tathaa upanyaas donon rachanadharmita par samaan mahatta or loksiddh pratishtha ke adhikari hai
 


 Both the storytellers are complex in both genres
 sanjeev is kram main teesri kadi prathit hote hai
 Most of Sanjeev's writing is research-focused
 unki rachana-prakriya bhi unki is samaj ko prakat karti he ki rachana bhavaveg kii parinti se aage badhkar sangharmpurn nirmaan kii ek prakriya he
 This statement is also made clear by Sanjay's statement to Sanjeev - a draft of the composition on the desired subject will complete it
 phir ham kuch mitra kisi din baithak karenge
 It will tell its instrument 


 We will draw it fiercely 


 It will keep on noting down every single thing
 dubaara likhakar kuch asaahitiyik aadamiyon ko sunayega- katha-ras or sampreshniyata kii pariksha ke liye


 phir tibaara kabhi-kabhi to chaar-paanch baar bhi
 It also rewrites his novels several times
 swayan sanjeev kaa maananaa he ki bina shodh or sandhan ke mujhe lagata he ki main nahin likh paaoonga
 In fact, his writing is completely committed writing
 'kala kala ke liye' kaa unke liye koi mahatva nahin he
 They not only believe in 'art for life' but also live it
 is sandarbh main baraabar unhone gogol kaa udhaaharan diya he
 He says that Gogol has always been the standard for me, 'he did not write what he could write, he did not write what the people wanted but he wrote what would benefit his society and country
 ' abhi bhi meraa lakshya vahi he
 But this does not mean that they do not give importance to 'art'
 unki rachanaaon main kathy evam shilp kaa apurv sangyojan hua he
 At a glance, the multiplicity of facts seems to cause problems in the eyes of critics, but the skill with which they make local use of facts as well as the atmosphere makes them distinctive
 da0 pushpapal singh kaa spasht kathan he ki sanjeev hamaare un chand samakaleen kathakaron main agrani sthaan rakhte hai jo rachana main vichaar kaa sangunfan atyant kushalta, kemiyagiri ke saath karte hai, jinaki kahani ko padhakar pathak ko ek vaicharik sampannataa to milti he, yah pratiti bhi bani rahati he ki usne kahani padhi he
 Most of his novels are the creative culmination of intense research

 In 'sutradhar', the life of the folklorist beggar Thakur is portrayed in multi-dimensionality, then the novel 'rahe Gaye Dishaye Isi Paar' published in 2011 breaks the new ground of creation through fiction
 apane vaigyanik adhyayan evam anubhavon kaa puri tarah se rachanaatmak upyog karte hue sanjeev ne maanviya vikaas kii aseem aakankshaon ke madhya durnivaar vidambnaaon ke chithran-rup main apurv sansar rach daalaa he
 In the context of this novel, Dr
 Manager Pandey has admitted that in this multi-faceted process of consultation, Sanjeev is opposed to all kinds of injustice, tyranny and trespass and is in favor of a forward-looking, just and humane approach
 lagbhag chaar dashakon kii lambii lekhan-avadhi main faili unki kahani-yatra ke paath kendrit aalochan-vishleshan ke kram main dow0 ravi bhushan unki kahaniyon ko swatantra bharat kii vaastavik katha kaa abhidhaan dete he; saath hi yah bhi spashtatya maanate hai ki sanjeev kii kahaniyon kaa falak vyapak he
 Except Premchand and Yashpal, no other narrator of such a big story-sheet is in Hindi

 inside the earth
 vastutah yah prithvi kii upree parat main ek vibhang hota he jiske dwaara andar ke padaarth baahar nikalate hai
 The conical topography formed by the deposition of these substances released by volcanoes is called volcanic mountain
 jwalamukhi kaa sambandh plate vivartaniki se he kyonki yah paaya gaya he ki bahudhaa ye platon kii simaaon ke sahare paae jate hai kyonki plate seemayen prithvi kii upree parat main vibhang utpann hone hetu kamjor sthal uplabdh kara detii hai
 Apart from this, volcanoes are also found at some other sites which are believed to originate from mantle plume and such sites are known as hotspots
 bhu-akruti vigyaan main jwalamukhi ko aakasmik ghatana ke rup main dekha jaataa he or prithvi kii sataha par parivartan laane vaale balon main ise rachanaatmak bal ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he kyonki inase kai sthalroopon kaa nirmaan hota he
 On the other hand, environmental geography studies them as a natural disaster because it causes loss of ecosystems and life and property
 jwalamukhi Geologists are not unanimous about the activity, but if a volcano is currently erupting, or it is expected to burst soon, or if it has signs of activity like gas leaking, smoke or lava, or earthquake, then it Is considered active
 yah ve jwalamukhi hote hai jinke bare main vaigyanikon kii apeksha he ki ve fatenge nahin
 It is estimated that the lava and magma in them are gone and now there is no heat and material left to spew into them
 agar kisi jwalamukhi ke kabhi bhi visphotak prakaar kii sakriyata kii koi bhi ghatana hone kii smriti nahin ho to aksar use mrit samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult for scientists to distinguish between dead and dormant volcanoes, but if a volcano in human memory ever exploded long ago in history, it is considered dormant but not dead
 bahut se aise jwalamukhi hai jinhen fatne ke baad ek or visphot ke liye dabaav banane main lakhon saal guzar jate hai - inhen us dauraan supt mana jaataa he
 For example, the Toba volcano, which erupted nearly 70,000 years ago, killed all humans in the Indian subcontinent and the entire human race was on the verge of extinction, ready to re-erupt every 3,80,000 years
 is udgaar main lava ke saath adhik maatra main gas baahar nikalati he or lava kaa jamaav shanku kii tarah tathaa kabhi-kabhi gumbad yaa tile ke rup main hota he
 That is, those volcanoes whose cavity or mouth are not more than 100 feet in diameter and its shape is round or nearly round, and from which gas lava and fissile substances appear to be much higher in size with greater explosive emission
 Are called volcanoes with central origin
 ye atyadhik vinaashkari hote hai
 Eruptions cause severe earthquakes
 inhen visphot kii tivrata ke aadhaar par punah kai prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: In this type of eruption, the amount of gas with lava is small, which causes the lava to freeze on the ground through the crevices
 kabhi-kabhi adhik maatra main lava ke jamaa hone se moti parat ban jaati he jiske falswaroop lava maidan yaa lava pathaar banate he
 For example, in 1783, lava has erupted through a 17 mile long crack in Iceland
 jiskaa vistaar 218 mile tak tha
 It lost a fifth of Iceland's population

 The plateau part of the Deccan in India is formed by a cracking excavation of the Cretaceous era, and it is formed by black sandstone soil by weathering of basalt rocks

 When more is deposited then the cone becomes much larger and takes the form of a mountain
 ise jwalamukhi parvat kehete he
 The hole in the middle of this mountain is called volcanic hole, mouth or hole
 yah chhidr neeche se ek nalee dwaara judaa rahata he jise jwalamukhi nalee kehete he
 In a recent research, it has been found that the pace of current climate change can be slowed by small volcanic eruptions

 a food with more protein is called a body building food
 bhartiya nasl kii deshi gaay kaa dudh, ghi,daalen, tilhan, gari or kam vasa vaale tilhanon ke utpaada is varg main aate hai
 The food in which protein, vitamins and minerals are found in excess is called preservation food
 doodh or doodh ke utpaada, andey, kaleji, hari patteydaar subjiyan or fal is varg main aate hai
 Majority of the people in India eat more grains and their food is lacking in other energetic elements

 us vishaal talab ke pani se shivmandir main sthapit vishaal shivlinga kaa abhishek bhi kiya jaataa tha
 Raja Bhoj himself was a very great scholar and he is said to have written books on various subjects such as religion, astronomy, art, lexicography, building construction, poetry, pharmacology etc
 which still exist
 inke samay main kaviyon ko rajya se aashray mila tha
 He ruled from 1000 AD to 1055 AD
 inaki vidwata ke kaaran janamanas main ek kahawat prachlit hui kahan raja bhoj kahan gangu taili
 Bhoja was very brave, majestic, and virtuous
 inhone anek deshon par vijay praapt kii thi or kai vishyon ke anek granthon kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 He was a very good poet, philosopher and astrologer
 saraswatikanthabharan, shringarmanjari, champuramayana, charucharya, tatvaprakash, vyavaharasamucchy aadi anek granth inke likhe hue batalaaye jate hai

 ) jab unka dehant hua to kaha gaya - Raja Bhoj was the son of Munj's younger brother Sindhuraj
 rohak inkaa pradhan mantri or bhuvanpaal mantri tha
 Kulachandra, Sadi and Taraditya were his commanders, with whose help Bhoja handled the operations smoothly
 apane chachaa munj kii hi bhanti yah bhi pashchimi bharat main ek samrajya sthapit karnaa chaahate the or is ichha kii purti ke liye inhen apane padosi rajyon se har disha main yuddh karnaa padaa
 Parmar was very agitated after Munj died in a mourning situation and hence Parmar was inspired by the Bhoj Chalukyas to march south with the idea of revenge lane
 unhone ne daahal ke kalburi gangeyadev tathaa thanjore ke rajendra chol se sandhi kii ore saath hi saath dakshin par akraman bhi kar diya, parantu tatkaaleen raja chalukya jaisingh dwitiya ne bahaduree se saamana kiya or apana rajya bachaa liya
 Sometime after 1044 AD, Someshwar II, the son of Jai Singh again turned hostile to the Paramaras and attacked the Malwa kingdom and forced Bhoja to flee
 dharanagari par adhikaar kar lene ke baad usne aag laga di, parantu kuch hi dinon baad someshwar ne maalav chhod diya or bhoj ne rajdhani main lotakar phir sattadhikaar praapt kar liya
 Shortly before 1018 AD, Bhoja defeated a person named Indaratha, possibly a feudatory of the Gang kings of Kalinga
 jaisingh dwitiya tathaa indrarath ke saath yuddh samaapt kar lene par bhoj ne apni sena bharat kii pashchimi seemaa se lage hue deshon kii ore badhaai or pehle laat naamak rajya par, jiskaa vistaar dakshin main bombai rajya ke antargat surat tak tha, akraman kar diya
 King Chalukya Kirtiraj surrendered there and Bhoja held the authority for some time

 In 1043 AD, Bhoja sent his fellow soldiers to the king of Delhi to fight against the Muslims of Punjab
 us samay punjab gazani samrajya kaa hi ek bhaag tha or mahmud ke vanshaj hi vahaan rajya kar rahe the
 The Raja of Delhi got help from other parts of India and he traveled towards Punjab and defeated the Muslims and occupied some part of that country for a few days but in the end the king of Ghazni defeated him and lost the lost part again in his empire

 uttar main bhoj ne chandelon ke desh par bhi akraman kiya tha jahaan vidyadhar naamak raja rajya karata tha
 But there was no benefit from it
 bhoj ke gwalior par vijay praapt karne ke praytn kaa bhi koi acha fal na hua kyonki vahaan ke raja kachchapaghat kirtiraj ne uske akraman kaa datakar saamana kiya
 It is believed that Bhoja had also conquered Kannauj for some time during the post-transformation period of the decline of Pratiharas
 bhoj ne rajasthan main shakambhari ke chaahamanon ke viruddh bhi yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii or tatkaaleen raja chaahmaan veeryaram ko haraaya
 He then threatened to win a kingdom called Shalit Nadul by the Anhil of the family of Chahmanas, but Parmar was defeated in the war and his chief commander-in-law, Sadi, lost his life
 bhoj ne gujarat ke chaulukyon se bhi, jinhone apni rajdhani anhilapattan main banaai thi, bahut dinon tak yuddh kiya
 Chamudaraja, son of Chalukya Solanki King Moolraj I, had to be humiliated by the arms of Parmar Bhoja in Malwa while going to Varanasi
 uske putr evam uttaradhikari ballabhraj ko isapar bada krodh aayaa or usne is apmaan kaa badla lene kii sochi
 He prepared a large army against Bhoja and attacked Bhoja, but unfortunately he died of smallpox on the way

 After some time, the BJP also defeated him in the war
 durlabhraj ke uttaradhikari bhim ke rajyakaal main bhoj ne apane senapati kulchandra ko gujarat ke viruddh yuddh karne ke liye bheja
 Kulchandra conquered the entire region and looted his capital Anhilapattan
 bhim ne ek baar abu par akraman kar uske raja parmaar dhandu ko haraaya tha, jab use bhagkar chitrakoot main bhoj kii sharan leni padi thi
 As mentioned above, shortly before 1055 AD, Bhima attacked Malwa by entering into a treaty with Kalachuri Karna, but he could not get possession of that region during the banquet

 Hammir Dev Chauhan was a descendant of Prithviraj Chauhan
 unhone ranthambor par 1282 se 1301 tak rajya kiya
 They are among the greatest rulers of Ranthambore

 Hammir Dev Chauhan is also known as 'karna' of the Chauhan period
 prithviraj chouhan ke baad inkaa hi naam bhartiya itihaas main apane hath ke kaaran atyant mahatv rakhata he
 Hammir Dev is considered to be the most powerful and talented ruler of the Ranthambore Empire of Rajasthan
 is shaasha ko chouhan vansh kaa udit nakshatra kahana atishyokti nahin hoga
 According to Dr
 Harvilas Sharda, Hammir Dev was the first son of Jaitrasinh and had two brothers, whose names were Suratana Dev and Birama Dev
 doctor dasharath sharma ke anusaar hammir dev jaitrasingh kaa teesraa putr tha vahiin gopinath sharma ke anusaar sabhi putron main yogyatam hone ke kaaran jaitrasingh ko hammir dev atyant priy tha
 Hammir Dev's father's name was Jaitrasinh Chauhan and mother's name was Hira Devi
 yah maharaja jaitrasingh chouhan ke laadle evam vir bete the
 Rao Hammir Dev Chauhan Ranthambore was the ruler of Ranthabhwar
 ye prithviraj chouhaan ke vanshaj the
 His father's name was Jaitrasingh
 ye itihaas main ‘‘hathi hammir ke naam se prasiddh hue hai
 When Hammir became the ruler of Ranthambore in 1339, a new chapter in the history of Ranthambore begins
 hammir dev ranthambhore ke chouhaan vansh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee evam mahatvapurn shaasha the
 He established a vast empire with his muscle power
 raav hammir dev chouhaan ranthambhore “rantabhanvar ke shaasha the
 He was a descendant of Prithviraj Chauhan
 inke pita kaa naam jaitrasingh tha
 They have become famous in history as "hathi Hammir"
 jab hammir visan 1339 main ranthambhore ke shaasha bane tab ranthambhore ke itihaas kaa ek nayaa adhyay prarambh hota he
 Hammir Dev was the most powerful and important ruler of the Chauhan dynasty of Ranthambore
 inhone apane baahubal se vishaal samrajya sthapit kar liya tha
 Jalaluddin Khilji attacked Ranthambore in 1347 AD
 sabase pehle usne chhangarh par akraman kiya
 The Muslim army took control of this fort after strong resistance
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore par akraman karne ke liye aage badi
 He attacked to take over the fort, but the Chauhan heroes, led by Hammir Dev, did so much harm to the Sultan, that he was forced to return to Delhi
 chhangarh par bhi chouhanon ne dubaara adhikaar kar liya
 Two years after this attack, the Muslim army invaded Ranthambore again, but they were defeated this time and returned to Delhi
 visan 1353 main sultan jilaluddin khilji kii hatya karke allaudin khilji dilli kaa sultan bana
 He aspired to bring the whole of India under his rule
 hammir ke netritv main ranthambhore ke chouhanon ne apni shakti ko kaaphi sudrudh bana liya or rajasthan ke vistrut bhubhag par apana shashan sthapit kar liya tha
 Alauddin Khilji did not want to see the increasing power of the Chauhans near Delhi, so a struggle was inevitable
 i
sa
 1299 main allaudin kii sena ne gujarat par akraman kiya tha
 They were bringing a lot of loot money from there to Delhi
 maarg main lut ke dhan ke bantwaare ko lekar kuch senanayakon ne vidroh kar diya tathaa ve vidrohi senanayake raav hammirdev kii sharan main ranthambhore chale gaye
 These commanders were Mir Muhammad Shah and Kamru
 sultan allaudin ne in vidrohiyon ko saunp dene kii maang raav hammir se kii, hammir ne uski yah maang thukraa di
 Rao Hammir, following the principles of Kshatriya religion, did not return the soldiers who came to the asylum
 sharan main aae hue kii raksha karnaa apana karttavya samajha
 Alauddin got angry on this and prepared for war on Ranthambore
 allaudin kii sena ne sarvapratham chhangarh par akraman kiya
 He easily got here
 chhangarh par musalamaanon ne adhikaar kar liya he, yah samachar sunakar hammir ne ranthambhore se sena bheji
 The Chauhan army defeated the Muslim soldiers
 muslim sena parajeet hokar bhaag gai, chouhanon ne unka lutaa hua dhan va astr-shastr lut liye
 In 1358 AD, Alauddin Khilji again attacked the Chauhans
 chhangarh main donon senaaon main bhayankar yuddh hua
 In this war, Hammir himself did not go to war
 vir chouhanon ne veertapurvak yuddh kiya lekin vishaal muslim sena ke saamne kab tak tikte
 In the end, the Sultan took control of Chhangarh
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore kii taraf badhane lagi
 The Turkish generals sent information to Hamir Dev, to hand us over to our rebels, whom you have given shelter to
 hamaari sena vaapis dilli laut jaaegi
 But Hammir was firm on his word
 usne sharnaagaton ko saunpane athwa apane rajya se nirvasit karne se spasht manaa kar diya
 The Turkish army laid siege to Ranthambore
 turki sena ne nusrat khan or ulug khan ke netritv main ranthambhore par akraman kiya
 Due to the fort being on a very high mountain, it was very difficult for the enemy to reach it
 muslim sena ne gheraa kada karte hue akraman kiya lekin durg rakshak un par pattharon, baanon kii bauchhaar karte, jisase unki sena kaa kaaphi nuksaan hota tha
 This kind of encirclement of the Muslim army continued for many days
 lekin unka ranthambhore par adhikaar nahin ho sakaa
 Alauddin again sent messengers to Rao Hammir to hand over the rebel soldiers, our army would return to Delhi
 hammir hath purvak apane vachan par drudh tha
 For a long time the circle of the Muslim army continued and the Chauhan army kept on fighting
 allaudin ko ranthambheer par adhikaar karnaa mushkil lag rahaa tha
 He resorted to deceit
 hammir ke paas sandhi kaa prastaav bheja jisko paakar hammir ne apane aadmi sultan ke paas bheje
 Among those men, there was a Surjan Kothari and some crying heroes
 allaudin ne unako lobh laalach dekar apni taraf milaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Some of these secretly turned to the Sultan
 durg kaa dheraa bahut dinon se chal rahaa tha, jisase durg main rasad aadi kii kami ho gai
 The fortress now considered the final decisive war
 rajputon ne kesharia vastra dhaaran karke shaakaa kiya
 The Rajput army opened the fort's doors
 bheeshan yuddh karnaa prarambh kiya
 There was a face-to-face battle on both sides
 ek ore sankhya bal main bahut kam rajput the to duusari ore sultan kii kai guna bady sena, jinke paas paryeti yuddhadi saamagree evam rasad thi
 In front of the might of the Rajputs, the Muslim soldiers could not stand, they ran away leaving the flags of the Muslim soldiers, the Rajputs snatched and the Rajput army returned to the fort
 durg par se raniyon ne musalamaanon ke jhando ko durge kii ore aate dekhakar samajha kii rajput haar gaye atah unhone johar kar apane aapako agni ko samarpit kar diya
 On entering the fort, seeing the flames of Jauhar, Hamir realized his mistake
 usne praayshchit karne hetu kile main sthit shiv mandir par apana mastak kaat kar shankar bhagwaan ke shivlinga par chadhaa diya
 When Alauddin came to know about this incident, he returned and captured the fort
 yah pankti hammir mahakavy main hammir dev chouhan ke bare main likhi gai he is pankti kaa taatpary he ki rajasthan ke ranthambhore samrajya kaa maharaja hammir dev chouhan singh ke samaan gujarata tha arthath usne kabhi chhupakar muqabla nahin kiya wo sher kii bhanti raaj karata tha
 The promise of the word means that King Hammir considered it his first duty to fulfill the promise given to him, and in the same way that the fruit of the Kadali grows once in the same way, in the same way, King Hammir was also angry when he got victory over anger
 
 triya arthath aurat ko shaadi ke vakt ek baar hi tel chadhaane kii rasm hoti he usee prakaar hammir bhi kisi kaary ko baar baar dohraane kii bajaae ek hi baar main puraa karnaa mahatv purna samajhataa tha arthath raja hammir dev chouhan kaa hath uski nidarta kaa pratik rahaa he
 He was the only Chauhan ruler who considered independent rule to be his pride and this self-respect of Hammir Dev Chauhan was heartening to Maharana Pratap and Pratap did not accept the Mughal ruler Akbar's lifetime suzerainty
 doctor dasharath ne mana he ki hammir dev chouhan ke pita maharaja jaitrasingh ne hammir kaa rajarohan san 1282 main apane hi jeevankaal main kar diya tha
 According to the Hammir epic, Hammir was not the eldest son, however he sat on the throne on the Vikram Samvat 1339 in Magh month on Sunday
 vahiin prabandhkosh ke anusaar hammir dev chouhan kaa rajarohan vikram sanwat 1343 ke kareeb bataaya gaya he
 The creation of both the Hammir epic and Prabandhak epics were contemporaries of Hammir Dev, Dasharatha Sharma accepted the coronation of Hammir Dev between 1339 and 1343 and his father Jaitrasinh handled Hammir Dev as a vast empire of the Ranthambore empire
 But Hammir Dev Chauhan's ambitious ruler was not satisfied with this empire
 bharatvarsh ke aitihaasik shaskaon main hammir dev chouhan ko hathiraja hathpati ranpati evam ranpradesh kaa chouhan naam se pahchaan banaai
 The name of the beloved horse of Maharaja Hammir Dev Chauhan was Badal, the name of the queen of Hammir Dev Chauhan was Rangadevi and the name of her daughter was Padmala, which was very dear to Hammir Dev
 hammir dev shaiva dharm kaa anuyaayi evam bhagwaan shiv kaa param bhakt tha
 The creator of the Hammir epic was Nayanchandra Suri, this epic describes in detail the empire of Hammir Dev Chauhan, the great ruler of Ranthambore
 hammir mahakavy bhartiya itihaas kii ek mahaan kriti he
 Nayanchandra Suri has also briefly described Jaitrasinh and the earlier Ranthambore rulers in this epic
 padya rup main likhaa yah mahakavy ranthambhore samrajya ke vibhinn pahaluon kii jaankaree kaa mahatvapurn strout he
 This epic is filled with Hammir's anthem of valor

 There were two great rulers of Rajasthan whose epics were written and those were Prithviraj Chauhan and Hammir Dev Chauhan
 is mahaan granth kii rachana jodharaj ne kii thi, jodharaj goud brahman ke putr the
 He wrote Hambir Rasou in 1875, at the request of Chandra Bhan Chauhan, the king of Alwar, present Neemgarh

 In this Prabandhakavya, the character of Hammir Dev, the famous ruler of Ranthambore, is described on the Chappay system of the Veeragatha period
 is main bataaya gaya he ki hammir dev chouhan ne sharnaagat kii raksha ke liye apana sabakuch nyochhavar kar diya
 King Hammir defeated the Delhi ruler Jalaluddin Khilji several times and shattered the teeth of a ruler like Alauddin Khilji
 hammir rasau hammir kii virgthaon ke saath ojasvi bhashaa main bahut acha mahakavy he
 This epic tells that Muhammad Shah was very much in love with the Begum of Alauddin Khilji, the ruler of Mongol Delhi and robbed him of his wealth and fled from there, which Alauddin Khilji wanted to capture
 hammir rasau main allaudin khilji kii begum kaa naam chimna bataaya gaya he
 In Samvat 1902, Chandrashekhar Vajpayee wrote Hammir Hatha Granth
 isamen bhi is ghatnakram kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 According to Hammir Rasou, the Ranthambore Empire extended Hammir Dev from Ujjain to Mathura and from Malwa to Arbudachal
 hammir rasau se gyaat hota he ki hammir dev ujjain ko jitkar mahakaleshwar jyotirling main shiv kii puja kii thi evam ajmer ko jitkar pushkar main shahi snaan kiya tha
 Some verses of Hammir Rasou are intended: - kab hath kare alaudi, rantabhanvar garh aahi
 Kabhai Sekh Sarnai is staying, Bahimah Mahim Sahi
 
 Let me think in your mind, the title is not fermented

 In Hammir Hatha Chandrashekhar has shown the reality by following the best system, the poet has put a good effect on this allegiance of being loyal to Hammirsharanatharanagata

 According to Dashrath Sharma, Hammir Chauhan defeated King Jayasimha of Mandalgarh Udaipur and kept him captive in Ranthambore, after that Hammir Dev left him on the point that he would continue to give the Ranthambore empire forever and in the interest of every possible Ranthambore empire
 Will work hammir dev ne vartmaan mount abu ke raja pratapsingh ko parrast karne ke baad maar diya tha
 Prominent victories of Hammir Dev include: - is prakaar doctor gopinath sharma ne hammir dev chouhan ko saulah nrip mardaani evam dow dasharath sharma ne saulah vijay kaa karn kahkar pukaara he
 The kingdom where Hammir Dev invaded became part of the Ranthambore empire and perhaps this is the reason why Hammir Dev Chauhan started going to the stubborn emperor of India
