 Kautilya has described the king as the consort of elders from place to place, humble in learning, jitendriya and suppressor of the enemy-conspiracy etc
 aisa raja adharmik athwa atyaachaari banakar kis prakaar praja-peedan kar saktaa he ? iske vipareet raja ko praja ke liye pitru-tulya kaha gaya he, jo apni praja kaa paalan-poshan, sanvardhan, sangrakshan, bharan, shikshan ityadi vaisaa hi karata he jaisaa vah apni santaan kaa karata he
 It is right that Kautilya has also preached to take unethical measures for Shatruksha
 parantu is sambandh main arthshaastra ke nimna vachan ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie: That is, these diplomacy measures should be treated only with irreligious and wicked people, not with religious people

 Selitore is of the opinion that it would be appropriate to compare Kautilya with Aristotle, as both tend to place more importance on the state's objectives rather than occupying power

 Jamal Malik is a participant of Kaun Banega Crorepati
 jamaal ko sho kaa antim sawaal poocha janaa he tabhi sanchaalak use dhokhadhadi ke andeh main police ke hawaale kar detaa he
 Policemen are very strict with him so that he can tell the truth, but Jamal is adamant that he did not cheat
 The film's story goes into Jamal's premonition and the audience automatically gets a one-question answer
 sho ke sanchaalak ne jo-jo prashn kiye, un sabon ke uttar kahin na kahin uske jivan se jude hote hai
 In those portions of Jamal's life, Amitabh's signature is taken, his mother killed during the hindu-muslim riots in the slum, his friendship with an orphan girl named Latika
 Jamal goes to school briefly and names his brother Athos, his name Parthose, and Latika's third Musketeers on the three characters in his beloved book, The Three Musketeers

 He also takes Latika with him
 jab javed iskaa virodh karata he to saleem use maarane kii dhamkee detaa he
 Latika prevents him from doing so
 vah saleem ko bataati he to vah jamaal se prem karti he
 Saying this, hurts Salim's heart and breaks him
 baad ke dinon main jamaal ek kol centre main chaay bachane lagata he or chywala ke naam se mashhoor ho jaataa he
 One day a worker there asks to sit there for a while, then he searches the names Latika and Salim in the computer's data base
 vah saleem ke sampark main aa jaataa he, us samay tak saleem, javed ke gang kaa vishwasaneey gangester ban jaataa he
 One day Salim calls Jamal to Javed's house near him

 From there, he tries to drive Latika away, but Latika is caught

 police ke sawaalon ke jawaab main saleem apane jivan kii kahani kahata he or bataata he ki sho main puch gaye sawaal kahin na kahin uski jindagi se jude hue hai
 After knowing the truth, the policemen again allow him to go on the show
 idhar, latikaa saleem ke ghar par tivi sho dekh rahi he, jahaan jamaal sho ke antim sawaal kaa jawaab dene vaala he
 When Jamal uses the phone option of a friend for his last question, the phone picks up, but the answer to his question is not known
 lekin jamaal vikalpon main se sahi uttar dhundne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he
 He names the third musketeers as Armij and wins a show of two crores
 udhar, saleem latikaa ko vahaan se bhaga detaa he or khud javed kii goli se maaraa jaataa he
 The next night Jamal and Latika meet at the station

 In literature, where there is a law for the predominance of Shringar or Veer Ras in plays, the same Bhavabhuti brought a unique revolution in the Natyajatas, by writing Karun Ras Pradhan plays opposite him
 bhawabhooti to yahon tak kehete hai ki karun hi ekmaatr ras he
 The same compassion is expressed in other forms through distinction

 praja sukh ke liye pranpriya patni kaa bhi tyaag karne main jise koi hichak nahin he
 In this play, more than the description of the soft and sweet form of nature, its serious and severe form has been described which are unique and embellished

 That is why it has a special place in the Sanskrit theater world
