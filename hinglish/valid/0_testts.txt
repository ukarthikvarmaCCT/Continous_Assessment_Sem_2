 The management is responsible for determining and accomplishing the objectives for the organization
 ise sabhi kshetren ke anek prakaar ke uddeshyon ko praapt karnaa hota he tathaa sabhi hitarthiyon jaise-anshadhari, karmchaaree, graahak, sarkaar aadi ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhana hota he
 The main objective of any organization should be to utilize human and material resources for maximum possible benefit
 jiskaa taatpary he vyavsaay ke aarthik uddeshyon ko puraa karnaa
 These objectives are - to keep oneself alive, to earn profit and to grow
 kisi bhi vyavsaay kaa aadharbhoot uddeshy apane astitv ko banaae rakhana hota he
 Management should strive towards the survival of the organization
 iske liye sanghathan ko paryaapt dhan kamanaa chahie jisase ki laagton ko puraa kiya ja sake
 It is not enough for business to survive
 prabandh ko yah sunishchit karnaa hota he ki sanghathan laabh kamaaye
 Profit serves as an important impetus for the continued successful operation of the enterprise
 laabh vyavsaay kii laagat evam jokhimon ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak hota he
 Increasing your prospects in the long term is very important for the business
 iske liye vyavsaay kaa badhanaa bahut mahatva rakhata he
 Management should take full advantage of the potential of organization development to remain in the industry
 vyavsaay ke vikaas ko vikray aavart, karmchaariyon kii sankhya main vruddhi yaa phir utpaadon kii sankhya yaa poonji ke nivesh main vruddhi aadi ke rup main mapa ja saktaa he
 Creating benefits for society
 sanghathan chaahe vyavsaayik he athwa gaiyr vyavsaayik, samaaj ke ang hone ke kaaran use kuch saamaajik dayitvon ko puraa karnaa hota he
 This means creating favorable economic values for different parts of society
 isamen sammilit hai- utpaadan ke paryaavaran bhinn paddati apnaanaa, samaaj ke logon se vanchit virgon ko rojgaar ke avasar pradaan karnaa evam karmchaariyon ke liye vidhyalay, shishugrih jaisi suvidhaayen pradaan karnaa
 The box further gives an example of an organization fulfilling a corporate social responsibility
 sanghathan un logon se milakar banataa he jinase unka vyaktitv, prishthbhumi, anubhav evam uddeshy alag-alag hote hai
 All these become part of the organization to satisfy their diverse needs
 yah pratiyogi vetan evam anya laabh jaisi vittiya aavashyaktaaon se lekar saathiyon dwaara manyata jaisi saamaajik aavashyaktaaon evam vyaktigat badhotaree evam vikaas jaisi ucch stareey aavashyaktaaon ke rup main alag-alag hoti hai
 Management has to match individual objectives with organizational objectives to align with the organization
 prabandh ek saarvbhaumik kriya he jo kisi bhi sanghathan kaa abhinn ang he
 Now we will study some of the reasons why management has become so important- prabandh itnaa hi purana he jitani kii sabhyataa
 Although the origin of modern organization is new, but organized work has been taking place since ancient times of civilization
 vastav main sanghathan ko vishisht lakshan mana ja saktaa he jo sabhy samaaj ko asabhy samaaj se alag karata he
 The early practices of management were the rules and laws that emerged from the experience of government and commercial activities
 vyapaar evam vaanijya ke vikaas se kramshah prabandh ke siddhant evam vyavhaaron kaa vikaas hua
 The word 'prabandha' is used today in many meanings which highlight various aspects of its nature
 prabandh ke adhyayan kaa vikaas beete samay main aadhunik sanghathanon ke saath-saath hua he
 It has been based on both the experience and behavior of managers and the associated set of principles
 beete samay main iskaa ek gatisheel vishay ke rup main vikaas hua he
 Which has its own special characteristics
 lekin prabandh kii prakruti se sambandhit ek prashn kaa uttar dena aavashyak he ki prabandh vigyaan he yaa kala he yaa phir donon he? iskaa uttar dene ke liye aaie vigyaan evam kala donon kii visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen tathaa dekhen ki prabandh kahan tak inaki purti karata he
 What is art Art is the personal and efficient use of current knowledge to achieve desired results
 ise adhyayan, avlokan evam anubhav se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Now, because art is concerned with personal use of knowledge, a kind of originality and creativity is required to put into practice the fundamental principles studied
 kala ke aadharbhoot lakshan is prakaar hai- Art assumes that there is some theoretical knowledge already
 visheshgyon ne apane-apane kshetron main kuch moolbhoot siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he jo ek vishesh prakaar kii kala main prayukt hota he
 For example, literature on dance, public address / speech, art or music is acceptable
 is moolbhoot gyaan kaa upyog vyakti, vyakti ke anusaar alag-alag hota he
 Art is, therefore, a very personal concept
 udhaaharan ke liye do nartak, do vaktaa, do kalakaar athwa do lekhakon kii apni kala ke pradarshan main bhinnata hogi
 All art is practical
 kala vartmaan siddhanton ko gyaan kaa rachanaatmak upyog he
 We know that music is based on seven notes
 lekin kisi sangeetkaar kii sangeet rachana vishisht athwa bhinn hoti he yah is baat par nirbhar karti he ki in suron kaa kis prakaar se sangeet srijan main prayog kiya gaya he, jo ki uski apni vyakhya hoti he
 Management is an art because, it fulfills the following characteristics- prabandhak ek krambaddh gyaan-samooh he kinhin saamaanya satya athwa saamaanya siddhanton ko spasht karata he vigyaan kii moolbhoot visheshtaayen nimna hai- Science is a hierarchical set of knowledge
 iske siddhant kaaran evam parinaam ke bich main sambandh aadhaarit hai
 For example, the occurrence of the apple falling from the tree to Earth gives rise to the principle of gravity
 vaigyanik siddhanton ko pehle avlokan ke madhyam se viksit kiya jaataa he or phir niyantrit paristhitiyon main baar-baar pareekshan kar uski jaanch kii jaati he
 Scientific theories are universal for validity and application
 uparyukt visheshtaon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai prabandh vigyaan ke rup main kuch visheshtaon ko dhaaran karata he- It is necessary to manage all types of organization processes
 aapane yah bhi avlokan kiya hoga ki sanghathanon ko unka prabandh karne ke liye kuch vishisht yogyataon evam anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 You may have also noticed that on the one hand there has been an increase in the corporate form and on the other hand more emphasis is being placed on managing the business
 kya iskaa arth yah hua ki prabandh ek pesha he? is prashn kaa uttar jaanane ke liye aaie peshey kii pramukh visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen evam dekhen ki kya prabandh inako puraa karata he
 The following are the characteristics of the profession sabhi peshey bhalee-bhanti paribhaashit gyaan ke samooh par aadhaarit hote hai jise shiksha se arjeet kiya ja saktaa he
 Admission to the profession is limited by examination or educational qualification
 udhaaharan ke liye bharat main yadi kisi ko chartered accountint bananaa he to use bhartiya chartered accountint santhaan dwaara yojit kii jane vaali ek vishesh pariksha ko paas karnaa hoga
 All professions are associated with one or the other councils, which regulate their entry, issue certificates to work and prepare and implement the Aadhaar Code
 bharat main vakaalat karne ke liye vakeelon ko baar council kaa sadsy bananaa hota he jo unke kaaryon kaa niyaman evam niyantran karata he
 All professions are bound by a code of conduct that gives direction to the behavior of their members
 udhaaharan ke liye jab doctor apane peshey main pravesh karte hai to vah apane kaary naitikta kii shapath lete hai
 The basic purpose of the profession is loyalty and commitment and the interests of its customers
 ek vakil yah sunishchit karata he ki uske muvakkil ko nyaay mili
 Management does not fully meet the principles of the profession
 vaise isamen kuch visheshtaayen hoti hai jo nimna hai- Management is a universal term used in a group of relationships in an enterprise by people connected to each other to perform certain tasks
 prayek-vyakti kaa sambandhon kii is shrunkhlaa main kisi na kisi kaary vishesh ko puraa karne kaa uttardaayitv hota he
 In order to fulfill this responsibility, he is given some rights ie decision making authority
 adhikaar evam uttardaayitv kaa yah sambandh vyaktiyon ko adhikari evam adhinsth ke rup main ek duusare ko bandhate hai
 This creates different levels in the organization
 kisi sanghathan ke adhikaar shrunkhlaa main teen str hote hai- High Level Management - These are the senior most executive officers of the organization who are called by many names
 yah saamanytah chairman, mukhya kaaryakari adhikari, mukhya prachaalan adhikari, pradhan, uppradhan aadi ke naam se jane jate hai
 High management is a team of managers of different functional levels
 unka mul kaary sanghathan ke kul uddeshyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vibhinn tatwon main ekta evam vibhinn vibhaagon ke kaaryon main saamanjasy sthapit karnaa he
 These high level managers are responsible for the welfare and continuity of the organization
 form ke jivan ke liye ye vyavsaay ke paryaavaran evam uske prabhaav kaa vishleshan karte hai
 They formulate the goals and armaments of the new organization for their achievement
 vyavsaay ke sabhi kaaryon evam unke samaaj par prabhaav ke liye ye hi uttaradaayi hote hai
 The task of higher management is complex and stressful

 Middle level management- These are the link between upper managers and lower level, they are subordinate to upper managers and heads of first linear managers
 inhen saamanytah vibhaag pramukh, parichaalan prabandhak athwa sanyantr adheekshak kehete hai
 Middle level managers are responsible for the implementation of control plans and armaments developed by higher management
 iske saath-saath ye pratham rekhiy prabandhakon ke sabhi kaaryon ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 Their main task is to complete the plans prepared by the higher level managers
 iske liye Supervisory or Operations Manager - Foremen and supervisors come at the lower level in the authority line of the organization
 paryvekshak kaarybal ke kaaryon kaa pratyaksh rup se avlokan karte hai
 Their rights and duties are determined by schemes made by higher managers
 paryvekshan, prabandhakon kii sanghathan main mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he kyonki yah sidhe vaastavik kaary bal se samvaad karte hai evam madhya stareey prabandhakon ke dishanirdeshon ko karmchaariyon tak pahunchaate hai
 By these efforts, the quality of the product is maintained, the loss of goods is kept to a minimum and the level of safety is maintained
 kaarigari kii gunvattta, evam utpaadan kii maatr karmchaariyon ke parishram, anushaasan evam swamibhakti par nirbhar karti he
 Management is considered as the process of planning, organization, direction and control of tasks from members to the organization and the use of resources of the organization for achieving the set objectives
 yah pehle se hi yah nirdhaarit karne kaa kaary he ki kya karnaa he, kis prakaar tathaa kisko karnaa he
 This means setting objectives in advance and setting a path to achieve them efficiently and effectively
 suhasini ke sanghathan kaa uddeshy he paramparaagat bhartiya hathkargha evam hastshilp kii vastuon ko kharidkar unhen bechnaa
 He sells woven garments, decoration items, garments and household articles made from traditional Indian clothes
 suhasini inaki maatr, inke vibhinn prakaar, rang evam banaavat ke sambandh main nirnay leti he phir vibhinn aapurtikartaaon se unke kray athwa unke ghar main taiyaar karaane par sansadhano kaa aavanton karti he
 No one can prevent planning problems from occurring, but they can be anticipated and they can form contingency plans whenever they arise
 yah nirdhaarit yojana ke kriyanvayan ke liye kaary saunpane, kaaryon ko samoohon main baantne, adhikaar nishchit karne evam sansadhano ke aavanton ke kaary kaa prabandhan karata he
 Once a specific plan is prepared to meet the objectives of the organization, then the organization will examine the actions and resources necessary for the implementation of the plan
 yah aavashyak kaaryon evam sansadhano kaa nirdhaaran karegaa
 It decides who will do what work, where it will be done and when

 An important aspect of management is to ensure that the right people with the right qualifications are available at the right place and time to achieve the objectives of the organization
 ise maanav sansaadhan kaary bhi kehete hai tathaa isamen karmchaariyon kii bhartee, chayan, kaary par niyukti evam prashikshan sammilit hai
 Infosys Technology, which develops software, requires system analysts and programmers, while Labmart requires a team of designers and craftspeople
 nideshan kaa kaary karmchaariyon ko netritv pradaan karnaa, prabhavit karnaa evam abhiprerit karnaa he jisase ki vah supurd kaary ko puraa kar saken
 This requires creating an environment that inspires employees to function optimally
 abhiprerana evam netritv-nirdesan ke do mul tatv hai
 Motivating employees simply means creating an environment that motivates them to work
 netritv kaa arth he dusron ko is prakaar se prabhavit karnaa, ki vah apane netaa ke icchit kaary sampann karen
 a good manager, with the help of praise and criticism, directs in such a way that employees can contribute their best
 suhasini ke dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii chaadaron ke liye silk par bhadkile rangon ke chaape viksit kiye
 Although it looked very attractive, but due to the use of silk, it was very expensive for the common man
 unke kaary kii prashansa karte hue suhasini ne unhen suzav diya ki in silk kii chaadaron ko vah deepawali, christmas jaise vishesh avasaron ke liye sahej kar rakhen tathaa unhen niyamit rup se sooti vastren par chhaapen
 Control is defined as the act of managing in which it directs the execution of organization work to achieve the goals of the organization
 niyantran kaary main nishpaadan ke str nirdhaarit kiye jate hai, vartmaan nishpaadan ko mapa jaataa he
 It is matched to predefined levels and corrective steps are taken in the event of deviation
 iske liye prabandhakon ko yah nirdhaarit karnaa hoga ki safalataa ke liye kya kaary evam utpaadan mahatvapurn hai, uskaa kaise or kahan maapan kiya ja saktaa he tathaa sudharatmak kadam uthaane ke liye koun adhikrut he
 When Suhasini found that his team of designers made a bed sheet that was more expensive than the fixed price for his sale, he changed the cloth for the sheet to control costs
 prabandhak ke vibhinn kaaryon par saadharantaya uparokt kram main hi charchaa kii jaati he jiske anusaar ek prabandhak pehle yojana taiyaar karata he; phir sanghathan banaata he; tatpashchaat nirdesan karata he; or ant main niyantran karata he
 In fact the manager rarely performs these tasks one by one
 prabandhak ke kaary ek duusare se jude hai tathaa yah nishchit karnaa kathin ho jaataa he koun-sa kaary kahan samaapt hua tathaa koun-sa kaary kahan se prarambh hua
 In the process of managing an organization, a manager has to perform five tasks related to each other
 sanghathan ek aisi paddati he jo ek duusare se jude evam ek duusare par aadhaarit upapaddatiyon se bani he
 The manager has to connect these different groups to achieve the same objectives
 vibhinn vibhaagon kii gatividhiyon kii ekaatmakataa kii prakriya ko samanvay kehete hai
 Coordination is the power that binds all other functions of management to each other
 yah aisa dhaagaa he jo sanghathan ke kaary main nirantarata banaae rakhane ke liye kray, utpaadan, vikray evam vitt jaise sabhi kaaryon ko piroe rakhata he
 Coordination is sometimes considered a separate function of management
 lekin yah prabandh kaa saar he kyonki yah samuhik lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kiye gaye vyaktigat prayatnon main ekta laata he
 Each managerial task is an activity that contributes to the coordination in itself
 samanvay kisi bhi sanghathan ke sabhi kaaryon main lakshith evam anternihit hai
 The process of coordinating the actions of the organization starts with planning
 ucch prabandh puure sanghathan ke liye yojana banaata he
 According to these plans organization structures are developed and employees are appointed
 yojanaon kaa kriyanvayan yojana ke anusaar hi yah sunishchit karne ke liye nirdesan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If there is any difference between the actual actions and their achievements, it is resolved at the time of control
 samanvay kii kriya ke madhyam se prabandh kaa samaan uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon main ekta ko sunishchit karne ke liye vyaktigat evam samuhik prayatnon kii sahi vyavastha karata he, samanvay sanghathan kii vibhinn ikaayiyon ke bhinn-bhinn kaaryon evam prayatnon main ekta sthapit karata he
 It provides the required amount of effort, quantity, time and serialization that ensures the minimum attainment of planned objectives
 uparokt paribhaashaon se samanvay kii nimna visheshtaayen spasht hoti hai- Co-ordination brings togetherness in collective work - Coordination brings interests that are not related to each other or different from each other, unity in objective work activity
 yah samooh ke kaaryon ko ek kendra bindu pradaan karata he jo yah sunishchit karata he ki nishpaadan yojana evam nirdhaarit kaarykram ke anusaar ho
 Coordination brings unity in action - The objective of coordination is to bring unity in action to achieve the same objectives
 yah vibhinn vibhaagon ko jodne kii shakti kaa kaary karata he tathaa yah sunishchit karata he ki sabhi kriyaayein sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kii jaaen
 You found that the production and sales departments of Labmart have to coordinate their work so that production can be done as per the market demand
 samanvay nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he- samanvay koi ek baar kaa kaary nahin he balki ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 It starts with planning and runs till control
 suhasini thand ke samay ke liye vastren ke sambandh main june ke maheene main hi yojana bana leti he
 She then arranges for an adequate workforce
 utpaadan yojana ke anusaar hi iske liye lagaataar nigaraanee rakhti he use apane vipanan vibhaag ko samay rahete bataanaa hoga ki vah vikray pravartan evam vigyaapan ke prachaar ke liye taiyaar karen
 Coordination is a universal task - the actions of different departments depend on each other by nature, hence coordination is required at all levels of management
 yah vibhinn vibhaagon evam vibhinn staron ke kaaryon main ekta sthapit karata he
 Suhasini has to coordinate the works of the purchasing, production and sales departments in order to achieve opposition to the organization's purpose
 kray vibhaag kaa kaary kapadaa khareednaa he
 This becomes the basis for the activities of the production department and finally the sale becomes possible
 yadi kapadaa ghatiya gunvattta vaala he yaa phir utpaadan vibhaag dwaara nirdhaarit vishistataaen liye hue nahin he to isse aage kii bikri kam ho jaaegi
 If there is no coordination, there will be repetition and chaos in place of unity and integration in actions
 samanvay sabhi prabandhakon kaa uttardaayitv he- kisi bhi sanghathan main samanvay prayek prabandhak kaa kaary he ucch str ke prabandhak yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki sanghathan kii nitiyon kaa kriyanvayan ho, apane adhinsthon ke saath samanvay karte hai
 Middle-level managers coordinate with both upper-level managers and first-line managers
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki kaary yojanaon ke anusaar kiya jaae, prachaalan str ke prabandhak apane karmchaariyon ke kaaryon main samanvay karte hai
 Coordination is a thought-provoking task - a manager has to coordinate the actions of different people carefully and thoughtfully
 kisi vibhaag main sadsy swechha se ek duusare se sahyog karte hue kaary karte hai, samanvay is sahyog kii bhaavana ko dishanirdesh detaa he
 In the absence of coordination, cooperation will also prove fruitless and coordination without cooperation will lead to dissatisfaction among the employees
 isliye ham kah sakate hai ki samanvay, prabandh kaa pruthak se ek kaary nahin he balki yah uskaa saar he
 If an organization wants to achieve its objectives effectively and efficiently, it will require coordination
 maala main dhaage ke samaan hi samanvay prabandh ke sabhi kaaryon kaa abhinn ang he
 Integrating various managerial functions ensures adequate coordination among individuals and departments
 jaise samanvay kii samasya ke paidaa hone ke kaaran bade paimaane ke sanghathan main antarnihit nirantar parivartan kamjor athwa niskriy netritv evam jatiltaayen hai
 Coordinating these kinds of complexities in large organizations requires special efforts
 sanghathan kaa aakaar-bade sanghathanon main lage badi sankhya main log samanvay kii samasya ko jatil bana dete hai
 Each person is unique in itself
 tathaa apni evam sanghathan kii aavashyaktaaon ko mahasoos karata he
 Each has his / her own working habits, his / her background, proposals / ways of dealing with situations and relationships with others
 vaise ek akelaa vyakti sadaa budhimaani se kaary nahin karata he
 His behavior is neither always well understood nor fully predictable
 isliye sanghathan kii kaary kushalta ke liye yah anivaary he ki vyakti evam samooh ke uddeshyon ko samanvay dwaara ekikrut kar diya jaae
 Functional Differentiation - The functions of the organization are repeatedly divided into departments, divisions, sections etc
 samanvay kii samasya isliye paidaa hoti he kyonki adhikaar kshetren kaa drudhikaran ho jaataa he or unke bich ke avarohak or bhi adhik majboot ho jate hai
 Many times this is because the classification of tasks is not tactical or the managers do not follow a logical path, but take the path of experience
 aise maamalon main sanghathan main prabhavi dhang se kaary karne ke liye samanvay aavashyak he
 Specialization - There is a high degree of specialization in modern organizations
 vishishtikaran kaa janm aadhunik takneekon kii jatiltaaon tathaa kaaryon evam inhen karne waalon kii vividhta ke kaaran hota he
 Experts think that they are capable of testing each other on the basis of profession but other people may not have any adequate basis for such a decision
 yadi visheshgyon ko bina samanvay ek bhumandaleey prabandhak ke saamne chunauti ke kaary karne kii anumati de di jaae to parinaam kaaphi manhage honge
 That is why a composition mechanism is needed to coordinate the work of various experts engaged in the organization
 samanvay prabandh kaa saar he
 This is not something a manager may order
 balki yah to vah cheez he jise ek prabandhak niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nirdesan niyantran kaaryon ko karte hue praapt karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Hence each task is a practice of coordination
 sanghathan evam inke prabandh main parivartan aa rahaa he

 Managers who have knowledge of analyzing, analyzing, engineering and technology are still needed today, but how teams work in individuals, how organizations work and how they can motivate people for worldwide success
 It is very important to have understanding of everyone
 udhaaharan ke liye jo prabandhak vibhinn samskritiyon main paith rakhata he vah pashchimi europe, gaiyr angreji bolne vaale desh main kaary kar saktaa he phir malaysia athwa kenya jaise vikasshil deshon main ja saktaa he or phir use neuyark, you- es- e- ke karyaalay main hastantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 He will be able to work effectively at these three places immediately

 Alexander was the first to break the security lines of Theban, with Philip's generals behind him, after damaging the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to advance and to surround them quickly
 athenian ke haarane ke saath hi, thibian akele ladane ke liye bache hue the or chaaron ore se ghire hue the
 They eventually lost
 cheronia main jeet ke baad, philip or sikandar nirvirodh pelloponniz kii ore badhane lage jahaan unka sabhi shaharon dwaara swaagat kiya gaya; haalanki, jab ve sparta pahunche, vahaan unhen nakaar diya gaya, lekin philip ne yuddh kaa sahaara nahin liya gaya
 In Corinth, Philip founded the "hellenic Alliance", which included most of the Greek city-states except Sparta
 philip ko is lig ke naam par hegon naam diya gaya, or usne farsi samrajya par hamalaa karne kii apni yojana kii ghoshnaa kii
 When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Iridis, the niece of his commander Atalus
 is vivaah se sikandar kii uttaradhikari ke rup main daavedaari sakant main aa gai, kyonki cleopetra iridis se utpann betaa puri tarah se macedonion uttaradhikari hota, jabaki sikandar keval aadha macedonion tha
 During the wedding feast, the drunken Atlas publicly prayed to the gods that a legitimate heir would now be born in the Macedonia
 sikandar apni maa ke saath mecedon se bhaag kar, use apane mamaa, epirus ke raja alexander pratham ke paas dodona main chhod diya
 And himself went to Illyria, where he sought protection from the Illyrian king
 kuch saal purv sikandar se ladaai main parajeet hone ke baavjood usne sikandar kaa atithi ke taur par swaagat kiya
 However, it appears that Philip never wanted to reject his politician and military-trained son
 tadanusaar, sikandar ek pariwarik dost, dameratus ke prayaason ke kaaran chah maheene ke baad macedoniyaan waapas laut aata hai
 In the following year, Pixodaras, the Persian governor of Caria proposed marriage to his eldest daughter, Alexander's half-brother, Philippe Erhidius
 olympius or sikandar ke kai doston ne suzav diya ki philip ne arhidiyas ko apana uttaradhikari banane kaa iraadaa kiya he
 Alexander sent an angel to Thessalyus to tell Thessalus that he should give his daughter's hand to Alexander instead of giving it to the illegitimate son
 jab philip ne is bare main suna to usne prastaav vaarta ko roak diya or sikandar ko chillaate hue kaha ki vah cu pixodaras kii beti se shaadi karnaa chahta he, usne samajhaayaa ki vah uske liye behatar dulhan chahta tha
 Philip deported four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Narcus, Ptolemy, and Arizius, and sent the Corinthians to bring Thessalus into chains
 336 isa purv kii garmiyon main, eige main apni beti cleopetra ke vivaah main bhaag lete hue philip ko uske angrakshakon ke captain, posnis dwaara hatya kar di gai
 When Posnis attempted to escape, Alexander's two companions, Perdicus and Leonatus, followed and killed him
 usee samay, 20 varsh kii umr main sikandar ko raison or sena dwaara raja ghoshit kar diya gaya
 As soon as he took the throne, Alexander started destroying his rivals
 jisaki shuruyaat usne apane chachere bhai, purv amintas chauthe kii hatya karavaake kii
 He also killed two Macedonian princes of the Lancastes region, though leaving a third, Alexander Lancastes
 olympius ne cleopetra iridiis or europa ko, joki philip kii beti thi, jinda jala diya
 When Alexander came to know about this, he was outraged
 sikandar ne atlus kii hatya kaa bhi aadesh diya, joki cleopetra ke chachaa or asia abhiyaan kii sena kaa agrim senapati tha
 Atalus had gone to Athens at that time to talk to Demothanes about the possibility of his loss
 atlus ne sikandar kaa kai baar ghor apmaan kar chukaa tha, or cleopetra kii hatya ke baad, sikandar use jivit chhodane ke liye bahut khatarnaak maanata tha
 Alexander left Erhidius, who was mentally handicapped, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias
 philip kii mrityu kii khabar se kai rajyon main vidroh hone laga, jinamein thibs, athens, thisli or macedon ke uttar main thresian janajati shaamil the
 When news of the rebellion reached Alexander, he immediately noticed it
 kootneeti kaa istemaal karne ki bajaay, sikandar 3,000 macedonian ghudsavaar sena kaa gathan kar, thisli kii taraf dakshin main kooch karne laga
 He found that Thistley's army, occupying the path between Mount Olympus and Mount Osa, ordered his army to climb Mount Osa
 duusare din jab thislian sena jaagi, to paaya ki sikandar apni sena ke saath unke peeche khadaa tha, or unhone turant aatmasamarpan kar diya
 Alexander joined his cavalry and started marching south towards the Peloponnese
 sikandar thermopyle main rukaa, jahaan use amfictionik lig ke netaa ke rup main chunaa gaya, phir vah waha se dakshin kii ore corinth ki ore nikal gaya
 Athens pleaded for peace, which Alexander accepted and pardoned the rebels
 sikandar or diojanij diogens da sinik ke bich prasiddh mulaakaat corinth main rahane ke dauraan hui thi
 When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for them, the philosopher disgustingly asked Alexander to stand aside, as he was blocking the sunlight
 is hajir jawaab se alexander ko khush hua, or usne kaha kii "agar main sikandar nahin hota, to main diogens bananaa chahta"
 In Corinth, Alexander was given the title of hegemon as Philip was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia
 yahan use thresian vidroh kii khabar bhi praapt hui
 Before crossing Asia, Alexander wanted to secure his northern borders
 335 isa purv ke vasant main, vah kai vidrohon dabaane ke liye chal padaa
 Starting from Ampolis, he traveled eastward into the country of "independent Thracians"; And on Mount Hemus, the Macedonian army also defeated and defeated the Thracian armies at the heights
 aage sena tribali desh main ghus gaye or unhone unki sena ko laijinas nadi ke paas haraaya
 Alexander made a three-day journey to the Danube, and encountered the Gatte tribe on the opposite bank on the way
 raat ko hi nadi paar karte hue, usne unhen aashcharyachakit kar diya or pehali ghudsavaar jhadap ke baad unki sena ko peeche hatane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 It was up to Alexander when the news reached that the king of Celsius, Illyria, and Gluaki, the king of Tualanti, were rebelling against him in the open
 vah pashchim main ilariria ki ore rukh kiya, sikandar ne ek ke baad ek dono ko haraane ke baad, dono shaskaon ko apni saina ke saath bhaagane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 With these victories, he had secured his northern border
 jab sikandar apane uttar ke abhiyaan main tha, use thibs or athenian ke ek baar phir se vidroh ki jaankaree mili or sikandar turant dakshin kii ore chal padaa
 While others were hesitating to collide with Alexander, Thebes decided to fight
 thibs kaa pratirodh aprabhavi tha, or sikandar ne unhain pachhad shahar ko kabje main le liya or or is kshetra ko anya bootian shaharon ke bich main baant diya
 The end of Thebes silenced Athens and temporarily brought peace to all of Greece
 tab sikandar antipeter ko raaj-pratinidhi ke rup main chhod, apane asian abhiyaan nikal gaya
 After Spitomenes' death and his new marriage to Roxena, Alexander moved his attention to the Indian subcontinent
 usne gandhar ke sabhi pramukhon ko aamantrit kar, unhen apane adhikaar kshetra sikandar ke adheen karne ke liye kaha
 Ambhi, the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus River to the Jhelum River, accepted it, but the chieftains of some hilly regions, including the Ashwanyas and Ashwakyanas of the Kamboj region, refused to oblige
 aambhi ne sikandar ko dosti kaa yakeen dilaane or unhen moolyawaan uphaaron dene, uske sabhi sena ke saad khud uske paas gaya
 Alexander not only returned him his rank and gifts, but he gifted Ambi "persian clothes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 gold talents"
 sikandar ne apni sena baant di, or ambi ne sindhu nadi par pul ke nirmaan karne main hipastian or pedricus kii madad kii, saath hi uske sainikon ko bhojan kii aapurti karata rahaa
 He welcomed Alexander and his entire army with the most generous hospitality in his capital, Taxila city, in the greatest display of friendship
 sikandar ke aage badhane par, takshashila ne uski 5,000 logon kii ek sena kii madad ke saath, jhelum nadi kii ladaai main hissaa bhi liya
 After victory in this war, Alexander sent Ambi to negotiate with the Purvas, offering conditions like subduing the whole kingdom of Porus to Sikandar, since Ambi and Porus were old enemies, he rejected all the terms and Ambi with great difficulty
 Saved his life and escaped from there
 haalanki iske baad, donon pratidwandviyon ko sikandar ne vyaktigat madhyasthata se mail milaap kara diya; or takshashila ko, jhelum par bede ke liye upkaran or sanybal ke yogadan ke kaaran, aambhi ko jhelum nadi or sindhu ke bich kaa puraa kshetra saunpa diya gaya; machaatas ke bete philip kii mrityu ke baad use or shakti mil gai; sikandar kii maut ke baad or 321 isa purv triparadisus main praanton ke vibhaajan baad ke bhi use apane adhikaar ko barkaraar rakhane kii anumati di gai
 In the winters of 327 / 326 BC, Alexander led an expedition against regional tribes such as the Espacioi of the Kunar valleys, the Guaranis of the Gurus valley, and the Asenaki of the Swat and Buner valleys
 aspisioi ke saath ek bhayankar ladaai shuru hui jisamen sikandar kaa kandhaa ek bhaalaa se ghayal ho gaya, lekin aakhirkaar aspisioi haar gaya
 Alexander then faced Assakenoi, who fought the strongholds of Massaga, Ora, and Aaron
 massaga kaa kila ek khooni ladaai ke baad hi jeeta ja sakaa, isamen sikandar kaa takhnaa gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaya tha
 According to Curtius, "not only did Alexander kill the entire population of Massaga, but turned all his buildings into rubble
 " isi prakaar kaa narsanhaar ora main bhi kiya gaya
 After Massaga and Ora, many Ascensians fled to the fortress of Arones
 sikandar ne unka peechha kiya or chaar dinon kii khooni ladaai ke baad is ranneetik pahari-kile par kabja kar liya
 After the Arones, Alexander crossed the Indus in 326 BCE and won a great war against King Porus, who ruled the region between the Jhelum and the Chenab River, which is now the territory of Punjab
 sikandar, poras kii bahaduree se kaaphi prabhavit hue, or use apana ek sahyogi bana liya
 He appointed Porus as his vice-chancellor, and annexed the territory to his own conquest southeast to the Beas River

 66px 66px charyaapad puthi bankimachandra chattopadhyaay, rabindranath thakur, kaaji nazarul islam begum rokeya, mir mashaararaf hosen, sharatchandra chattopadhyaay The literature of Bengali language can be broadly divided into three parts - 1
 pracheen, 2
 Middle Carpet and 3
 aadhunik-
 Early literature is more important from the point of view of Bengal's life and its merits and demerits
 chandidas, krittivas, maladhar, pipalai, lochanda, gyaandas, kavikankan, mukundaram, krishnadas, kashiram das, bharatchandaray, gunakar aadi kavi isi kaal main hue hai
 Like other scholars of India, the scholars of Bengal used to give special importance to the works of Sanskrit
 unki drushti main vahi "amar bharti" kaa pad sushobhit kar sakati thi
 He considered colloquial language to be variable and temporary
 kintu jansadharan to apane vichaaron or bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye usee bhashaa ko pasand kar sakate the jo unke hriday ke adhik nikat ho
 They could teach and teach in the same language
 puraatan bengal main is tarah kii do bhashaayen prachlit thim-ek to sthaneey bhashaa, jise ham pracheen banglaa kah sakate hai, duusari akhil bhartiya jan saahitiyik bhashaa, jo saamanyat: samooche uttar bharat main samajhi ja sakati thi
 It can be called Nagar or Shaurseni Apabhransh, which was largely the language of western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Punjab and Rajasthan
 saamaanya janata ke liye in donon bhashaaon main thodaa sa sahitya vidyaman tha
 Songs of love and devotion, proverbs and folklore were found in the mother tongue
 buddha tathaa hindu dharm ke upadeshak janata main prachaar karne ke liye jo rachanaayen taiyaar karte the ve praaia: puraani banglaa tathaa nagar apbhransh, donon main hoti thim
 47 Chariyapads are of special importance in the available compositions of the ancient Bengali
 ye praaia: aath panktiyon ke rahasyamay geet hai jinka sambandh mahayan bauddhadharm tathaa nathpanth, donon se sambhddha gupt sampradaay se he
 Their common external meaning is often understood in this way and the deeper meaning can also be understood with the help of Sanskrit commentary, which was received with this collection as well as Sri Harprasad Shastri
 in geeton yaa padyon main "kavita" naam kii cheez to nahin he kintu jivan kii ekaadh jhalak avashya kisi kisi main dekh padati he
 Some other poetic compositions similar to this were also received from Nepal by Dr
 Prabodhchandra Bagchi and Rahul Sankrityayan etc
 " 12veen shatabdi ke ant tak puraatan banglaa main yathesht sahitya taiyaar ho chukaa tha jisase us samay ke ek bengali kavi ne yah garvokti kii thi "log jaisaa ganga main snaan karne se pavitra ho jate hai, vaise hi ve 'bengal vaani' main snaat hokar pavitra ho sakate hai
 "but unfortunately, apart from the said 47 Chariyapadas and few songs or verses, very few compositions of that period are available today
 gitgovind ke rachayita jayadev bengal ke hindu raja lakshmana sen ke shasankaal main vidyaman the
 There are 24 songs in this beautiful poem describing the love of Radha and Krishna, but not everyone is perfect
 sanskrit main praaia: tukant nahin miltaa
 This is the specialty of Apabhransh or the budding indo-aryan languages
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki in padon kii rachana mulat: puraani banglaa main yaa apbhransh main kii gai thi or phir unamem thodaa parivartan kar sanskrit ke anuroop bana diya gaya
 In this way Jayadeva can be considered a famous poet of ancient Bengal, who in addition to Sanskrit, probably composed in Old Bengali too
 jo ho, bengal ke kitne hi pargami kaviyon ko unase prerana mili, isamen andeh nahin
 There is no evidence that there has been a big poem written in the old Bengali
 us samay aisi rachanaayen bengal main bhi praaia: apbhransh main hi hoti thim
 However, when the famous poet Vidyapati of Mithila composed the famous historical poem, he also practiced it not in his mother tongue Maithili, but in Apabhramsa, although in between, the words Maithil have also been used
 15veen shatee tathaa vishesh rup se 16veen shatee se hi bade prabandh kaavyon evam varnanaatmak rachanaaon kaa nirmaan prarambh hua, udaahrnarya adarsh nari bihula or uske pati lakhidhar kii katha, kalketu or phullara kaa kathanak, ityadi
 In 1203, Turks invaded West Bengal

 No specific authentic texts of literary works of this time can be told

 It was during this period that the Bengali-speaking Muslim population emerged and grew gradually
 turk akramanakariyon main se bahuton ne bengal kii striyon se hi vivaah kar liya or dhire-dhire "yahan kii bhashaa, rahan sahan aadi ko" apana liya
 They forgot Turkish and Arabic remained the language of religion only
 bengal main hindu jameendaaron or saamanton kii hi vyavastha abhi prachlit thi, falat: muslim vichaaron or paddatiyon kaa janajivan par abhi drushtigochar hone yogya vishesh prabhaav nahin padane paaya tha
 When peace was established in Bengal after some time, when the study of Sanskrit, preaching etc
 was facilitated, then education and literature as if the primary renaissance started
 madhyamik banglaa ke pratham mahakavi, jinke sambandh main hame kuch jaankaree he, sambhavat: krittivas ojha the 
 He was the first popular poet to present the Sanskrit Ramayana in Bengali, who portrayed Rama as Valmiki, not as a pure human and heroic man, but as a compassionate avatar of God, towards whom the heart of the simple devotional people is easily attracted could
 isi tarah krishnagtha kaa varnan usee shatabdi main maladhar basu ne kiya
 It is based on the Bhagavata Purana
 bihula kii katha, jo vivaah kii pratham raatri main hi mansa devi dwaara preshit sarp ke dwaara pati ke dase jane par vidhwaa ho gai thi or jisane badi badi kathinaaiyaan jhelkar devataaon ko tathaa mansa devi ko bhi prasann kar pati ko pun: jivit kara lene main safalataa praapt kii thi, pativrata nari ke prem or saahas kii vah apurv pariklpana he jiskaa aavirbhaav kabhi kisi bhartiya mastishk main hua ho
 This story was probably prevalent before the arrival of Muslims, but the first story based on it was composed in Bengali in the 15th century
 inamen se ek ke rachayita vijaygupt or duusari ke vipradaas pipalai maane jate hai
 Chandidas, a famous poet of the pre-secondary Bengali, is considered
 inke naam se koi 1200 pad yaa kavitaayen prachlit hai
 There is so much difference in their language, style etc
 that they do not seem to be composed by the same person
 aisa prathit hota he ki madhyamik banglaa main is naam ke kam se kam teen kavi hue
 The first Chandidas were the pioneers of Srikrishnakirtan who existed before Chaitanya, around 1400 AD
 duusare chandidas dwij chandidas the jo chaitanya ke baad main yaa uttar kaal main hue
 He composed most of the songs of Radha Krishna's love interest that earned Chandidas such a popularity
 tisare chandidas deen chandidas hue jo sangrah ke teen chauthai bhaag ke rachayita prathit hote hai
 There is no doubt that the first two Chandidas were the mainstays of Chandidas's fame

 Mithila's kingdom was often untouched by Muslim invasions

 Vaishnava scholars and poets had prepared many collections of them, out of which Vaishnavadasa's "padalpataru" is particularly famous

 At the same time some religious stories were also written
 inamen ruparam krit dharmamangal vishesh prasiddh he jisamen lousian ke saahasik kaaryon kaa varnan he
 Manik Ganguly and Ghanram Chakraborty also presented compositions on the style of this story

 Among the edited texts, Hindi Shabdasagar, Nagari Pracharini Patrika, Bhramargeet Sar, Sur, Tulsi Jayasi Granthwali are notable
 shukla ji ne praayah saahitiyik or manovaigyanik niabandh likhe hai
 3 parts of literary essays can be done - saiddhanthik aalochanatmak niabandh- 'kavita kya he'
 Essays such as 'sanskritism of Lok Mangal in poetry', 'generalization and individualism', etc
 come under theoretical criticism
 aalochana ke saath-saath anveshan or gaveshna karne kii pravriti bhi shukla ji main paryaapt maatra main he
 'history of Hindi literature' is the result of this trend

 The language of the prose-literature of Shukla ji is standing and it often has two forms - shukla ji kaa donon prakaar kii bhashaa par purna adhikaar tha
 He is extremely careful, refined, mature and grammatically innocent

 The words are interwoven into the formula of sentences like pearls

 Shukla ji is perhaps the first critic of Hindi who made a genuine effort to interview the deep and broad goals of secret poetry in the fabric of diverse life
 unhone 'bhav yaa ras' ko kavy kii aatma mana he
 But in his view, the ultimate goal of poetry is not the joy but the reputation of Lokmangal by the sophistication, diffusion and harmony of various expressions
 unki drushti se mahan kavy vah he jisase jivan kii kriyasheeltaa ujagar hui ho
 He has called this the locality of folklore in poetry
 shukla ji kii samast moulik vichaarna lokajeevan ke moort aadarshon se patibaddh he
 'our heart is directly attached to the transverse forms of nature', therefore, the first and necessary work of the poet is to do 'bimbagrahan' or 'chitranubhav'
 purna wimbgrahan ke liye varnya vastu kii 'paristhiti' kaa chithran bhi apekshit hota he

 Shukla Ji's installations are not as scriptural as the original
 unhone apni lokbhaavna or manovaigyanik drushti se kavyashastra kaa sanskaar kiya
 With this view, they fall into Acharya category

 His power lies in poignant research into the practical and broader meanings of poetic life

 According to the sentiments, the behavior of man changes - in this view Shukla ji researched his social economy consciously

 It has been a trend that one cannot and does not ignore the path of Bharatanatyam training and the present medium presenting itself through "material" and the altered medium of "contemporary" Bharatanatyam
 is sandarbh main, 'badal madhyam' bheji ja karne ke liye sandesh ko badal sakate hai, jo andolanon, abhivyakti, saamaan, veshbhusha, sangeet, aadi main badlaav shaamil kar sakate hai
 The artist or choreographer tries to maintain a balance between the tradition of the past to suit contemporary concerns — it is said to be "to express dance and not to impress", it is factually Bharatanatyam The initial milestones have been embraced that were directly associated with the dance performed by the "devadasis"
 nrity kaa yah rup main baad main bhi bharatnatyam ko kala ke rup main naam diya jo rukmini devi arundell ne "punerjeevit kiya or mahima" kiya gaya tha
 This development can well be equated with the concept "contemporaising of Bharatanatyam"
 ise badalane kii maang ko puraa karne ke liye aadi veshbhusha, sangeet, saamaan, prastutiyon, kii tarah alag alag rup main aakaar le liya he, or bhi janata ke aakarshan kaa phayda hua

 is prakaar se takneekon kaa ek sangyojan shaamil karne ke liye style the
 As of now it is being developed to be the counter part to strengthen the parent-classical Bharatanatyam, to the extent that the entire topical Bharatanatyam parent dance form has been overshadowed
 shikshan bharatnatyam ke nae shaileyon jisase shastreey nrity ke paaramparik saar ko samrudh banane se nimnlikhit pidiyon naakaam viksit hoga
 There is no harm in contouring or stilagging any classical dance for as long as the traditional boundaries of classical dance are not treasured and hampered
 isliye, yah bharatnatyam apane samayik rup main, pradhanmantri times jivit rahane ke liye shastreey rup sahaayta karegaa ki mana ja saktaa he
 Depending on personal perception, this may seem well-metaphysical, while for some others, aesthetic experiences transcend and possibly appeal to something that is actually a subjective phenomenon
 bharatnatyam kaa uddeshy, anya dharmanirpeksh nrity roopon kii tarah, sahanaa or aam darshakon ko pyaari ho jayega ki ek drishy anubhav karne ke liye jis tarah se bhugtan karne ke liye hai

 The first glimpse of this was released in mid-june 2006 on Jack Braff's official website to arouse public interest
 micel or uski mahila mitra jena bina shaadi ke hi ek jode kii tarah rahete hai or unke sambandh bahut hi achche hai jiskaa vah puraa anand uthaate prathit hote hai: film kii shuruyaat se hi yah dikhaaya jaataa he ki jena garbhvatee he or uske mata-pita un donon ko shaadi karne ke liye samajha rahe hai
 Jenna thinks that because of Michael's work pressure and her ongoing research work, this time is not appropriate to get married right now
 vaastavik kaaran jo kisi ko pataa nahin he vah yah he ki micel is sambandh main fansaa hua or ghabrahat mahasoos karata he
 Although he admits that Jenna is the perfect companion for him, Michael still has a desire to think more about it
 ek vivaah ke dauraan vah sanyogvash kim se miltaa he, jisase vah apane sambandh ke is rahasy ke bare main baat karata he
 Kim feels that she is about to end her relationship with Jenna and so she starts flirting with him
 jabaki micel kim ki javandili, unmuktata or josh par mohit ho jaataa he, lekin vah kisi laalasaa ke saamne jhukta nahin he
 Kim tells Michael which school she attends and where she usually goes to hang out, and the two then separate
 micel antat ek din kim ko memorial union main dhund letaa he par use yah bataata he ki vah us ore apane kisi graahak se milane ke liye aayaa tha
 Kim senses that he is showing interest in her and invites her to a party when Michael was driving back home
 maaikel use sweekaar karata letaa he
 Arriving back at the office, Michael prepares an excuse not to be with Jenna on the night of the ceremony
 vah apane saath kaam karne vaale apane mitra kris se kahata he ki yadi jena uske bare main jaanane ke liye phone kare to vah koi bahaanaa bataakar sthiti ko sambhaal le
 kris ko shaq hota he ki micel kisi or ladki ke chakkar main he or isliye vah is maamle se dur rahanaa chahta he, kyunki kris bhi kuch samay pehle hi apni bivi se alag hua he; usne khud yah anubhav kiya he ki kisi sambandh ko samaapt karnaa kitna takalifdeh hota he
 Michael denies the existence of another girl and only says that he 'will be with an old friend of his college'
 kim ke saath samaaroh ke baad- jisame micel ke anusaar usne khud ko 10 saal chota anubhav kiya- donon kai baar ek duusare ko chuumate hai or isse pehle hi kim, micel ko apane hostel main raat bitaane kaa nimantran detii he
 However, he regrets cheating Xena, overcomes Michael's longing, and he refuses
 micel ke durbhaagya se usee raat izi ke pita kaa dehanth ho jaataa he
 Many friends and acquaintances, including Jenna and Chris, go to Izzy's house to express their solace
 vahaan par jena ko yah pataa lagata he ki micel ne kris se kaha tha kii vah izi ke ghar ja rahaa he, par vah vahaan nahin tha
 Jenna asks Chris about this but Chris refuses to answer her, which further increases Jenna's suspicion that Michael is no longer on the right track
 jab us raat micel ghar waapas lautataa he, jena uskaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar thi; pehle to micel is baat se inkaar karata he ki vah kim ke saath baahar gaya tha, lekin antat yah sweekaar kar letaa he ki vah kisi or ladki se miltaa he
 Although he states that he had not slept with that girl and that he has no special means of going out with that girl, Jenna shouts at him and kicks him out of the house
 micel akelaa, niraash or vyagr tha, tabhi kim kaa phone aata he
 Kim apologizes for expecting so much ahead of time and calls her to him just to talk
 maaikel taiyaar ho jaataa he
 The physical relationship between the two soon forms when Michael arrives there
 agali subah, micel koshish karata he ki vah bina kim ko uthaaye dhire se baahar chalaa jaye, par baahar pahunchne ke baad use yaad aata he ki vah apni chaabiyaan andar hi chhod aayaa
 When he goes back inside, Kim asks him why he left without even saying goodbye to her
 micel usase kahata he ki vah sirf isliye aise chalaa gaya kyunki vah use jagaanaa nahin chahta tha or aaj use apane kaam par bhi zaldi pahunchnaa tha
 Kim retrieves the lost keys from her pocket and returns the keys to Michael when Michael promises her that he will call her
 kaam par jane ke baad, micel yah yojana banaata he ki vah jena kii talash ke liye offis se zaldi nikal jaayegaa
 kahi jane ke dauraan, kim ek milijule gaanon kii sidi dene ke liye bina bataaye hi micel ke offis pahunch jaati he
 Michael confesses to him that he still loves Jenna, who is actually the mother of his child
 vah kim se maafi maangata he ki usne jena ke garbhvatee hone kii baat kim ko nahin bataai or jena ko dhundne ke liye use chhodkar chalaa jaataa he
 Michael arrives at Jenna's parents' home, Jenna's father Stephen gives her a rude speech on commitment and adulthood, and also gives her some advice to get Jenna's apology
 stephen micel se yah vinati karte hai ki vah hameshaa eemaandaar rahe or kabhi bhi apane prayaas se peeche nahin hate
 unki budhimaneepurn baaten sunne ke baad micel, jena ke kamare main jaataa he
 The two were about to compromise when Jenna asks him if he was right about not having a physical relationship with Kim
 micel ne kaha kii vah sach bol rahaa tha, lekin stephen kii salaah he kaaran usne jena se yah sweekaar kar liya ki vah us raat waapas kim ke paas gaya tha
 Although Michael convinces him that he is doing this just to tell the truth, Xena gets very angry and angrily walks out of the house and goes back to her home
 micel bhi uske peeche peeche aata he or dekhtaa he ki jena ne daravaaza andar se band kar liya he
 He decides that until Jena is ready to talk to him, he will sit on the verandah outside
 Day and night, even in the sun and rain, Michael is sitting at the front door and the attention of many neighbors turns to him and some of them even urge him to drink something
 stephen apni gaadi main baithkar udhar se gujarata he or micel ko vahaan paata he, micel bhi use dekhtaa he
 When Stephen is moving from there, a proud smile comes over his face, thinking that Michael took his advice seriously
 dhire-dhire lekin nishchit rup se jena naram padane lagati he, pehle to ek thandi shaam ke dauraan vah micel ko ek kambal detii he, phir uske baad agle din uske liye ek sandwich detii he
 On the eve of her third night in the verandah, Jenna breaks her silence and speaks to Michael from the other side of the closed door
 vah apane dukh bataate hue kahati he ki is sambandh ko khokar use aisa dukh ho rahaa he jaise ki usne apana jivan kho diya ho
 Later that same evening, Jenna opens the door and Michael goes inside

 Polyacrylic resha udyog kaa aarambh japan main 1950 ke dashak ke madhya main hua or tab acriloniteril ko ems ke sanshleshan hetu praarambhik vastu ke rup main apanaaya gaya
 Currently, most MSG in the world is produced by fermentation by bacteria, a process similar to that adopted for the production of wines, vinegar, yogurt, and even chocolate
 sodium ko baad main udaasinikaran ke charan main milaayaa jaataa he
 During fermentation, ammonia and select bacteria grown in a mixture of carbohydrates derived from sweet potato, sugarcane, tapioca, or sorghum emit amino acids in the mixture, from which L-glutamate is isolated

 Nowadays, the industrial production of MSG is continuously improving glutamate yield and production rate from sugar, which is helping to meet the demand for this material
 chaanane, sankendrit karne, amleekaran or clistaleekaran ke antim utpaada shuddh glutamet, sodium or jal hote hai
 It appears as a white, odorless, crystalline powder, which dissolves in glutamate and sodium in the solution

 In general, MSG remains stable under normal cooking conditions
 khaanaa pakaane ke dauraan, ems vighatit nahin hota he, parantu jaisaa ki anya amino amlon ke saath hota he, browning yaa myllard abhikriyaayein sharkara kii upasthiti main bahut adhik taapamanon par ho sakati hai
 Pure MSG has no sweet taste in itself, if it is not mixed with a flavorful aroma
 yadi swaad ke rup main ems ko sahi maatra main milaayaa jaae, to usamen anya swaad-sakriy yogicon ko santulit karne or kuch vyanjanon ke samgr swaad ko purnataa dene kii kshamta hoti he
 MSG combines well with meat, fish, poultry, a variety of tar, chutneys, juices and broths and enhances the overall flavor of foods such as beef stock
 lekin, sharkara ko chhodkar anya mul swaadon ke samaan, ems bhojan kii rochakata ko tabhi badhaata he jab use sahi maatra main milaayaa jaae
 If the quantity of MSG is excessive, the taste of the dish deteriorates rapidly
 haalaanki sahi maatra vyanjan-vyanjan par nirbhar karti he, rase main suswaduta kaa score tab teji se girane lagata he jab 100 mili main ems kii maatra 1 gram se adhik ho
 In addition, there are reactions with MSG and other umami substances such as salt and nucleotides
 sarvocch swaad ke liye in sabko ishtatam maatra main hona aavashyak he
 Because of these properties, MSG can be used to reduce salt ingestion, which is responsible for hypertension, cardiovascular disease and stroke
 kam namak vaale bhojanon kaa swaad ems ke saath us sthiti main bhi sudharta he jab namak kii maatra 30% tak kam kii jaae
 The amount of sodium in MSG is about 3 times less than that of sodium chloride
 kam namak vaale rason main glutamet ke anya lavenon kaa bhi upyog kiya gaya he, kintu ye in rason ko ems jitna suswaadu nahin bana pate hai
 MSG has been used for flavoring food for more than 100 years

 Today the situation is that international and national bodies related to food additives believe that MSG is safe for humans as a flavor enhancer
 "ems abhilakshan sankul" ko prarambh main "chini restaraan syndrome" naam rakhaa gaya tha, jab robert ho main qoke ne amareeki-chini bhojan karne ke baad use mahasoos hue abhilakshanon kaa varnan kiya
 Kwok cited a number of reasons for these characteristics, including the mixing of alcohol with alcohol, sodium content, or MSC
 lekin sara dhyaan ems par hi jam gaya or tab se in abhilakshanon ko ems ke saath jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 The effect of wine and salt content has never been studied
 jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya, gaiyr-vishisht abhilakshanon kii suchi suni-sunai baton ke aadhaar par lambii hoti ja rahi he
 Under normal circumstances, we have the power to digest glutamate, which has very little ability to produce acute virus

 Therefore, the ingestion of MSG as a food additive and the natural level of glutamic acid in foods is not a cause of toxicity to humans
 america kii praayogic jeevigyaan socitiyon ke sangh dwaara 1995 main america ke khaadya or dawa prashasan ke liye sankalit ek roport main yah nishkarsh diya gaya he ki "paaramparik staron tak" khaane par ems surakshit he or yadhyapi aise swasth laganevaale vyakti hai jinamein bina bhojan ke 3 gram ems khaane par ems abhilakshan sankul dekhne main aata he, ems ke kaaran mrityu kii ghatnaayen siddh nahin kii gai hai kyonki ems abhilakshan sankul likhit sakshya par aadhaarit he
 This report also suggests that there is no data supporting the role of glutamate in chronic or disabling diseases

 No statistical relationships could be demonstrated and only a small number of responses were received and were also inconsistent
 jab bhojan ke saath ems diya gaya, to ye abhilakshan nahin dekhe gaye
 Measures adopted to rule out experiment-level biases include a dual-disguised, placebo-driven experiment design and application via capsules because the after-test of glutamates is quite powerful

 anya adhyayanon main is par vichaar kiya gaya he ki kya ems motopa laata he or inke parinaam mishrit rahe hai
 There have been many studies on the so-called relationship between MSG and asthma; Currently available evidence does not confirm any such causal relationship
 chunki glutamet maanav mastishk main mahatvapurn tantrika-preshak hai, jo seekhney kii kriya main or smriti main ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai, tantrika-vishaarad is samay bhojan main vidyaman ems ke kisi sambhavit parshv-prabhaav kaa adhyayan karne main sanlagn hai, lekin koi nirnaayak sambandh ab tak sthapit nahin ho paae hai
 Food Standards Australia New Zealand, citing "overwhelming evidence of numerous scientific studies", categorically denying any association between MSG and "any serious adverse effects" or "long-lasting effects", MSG has been declared "safe for public"
 lekin, vah yah bhi bataata he ki aabaadi ke 1% se kam bhaag main, samvedansheel vyakti "alpakaalik" parshv prabhaav anubhav kar sakate hai, jaise, "sirdard, sunnata / jhurajuri, tamtamaana, peshiyaan akadana or saamaanya kamajori", yadi ve ek hi bhojan main emsiji kii bahut adhik maatra kaa antahgrahan karen
 Those who consider themselves sensitive to MSG are encouraged to get it confirmed with proper medical evaluation

 monosodium glutamet bhojan main milanevaale glutamic amla ke vibhinn roopon main se ek he
 The main reason for this is that since glutamic acid is an amino acid, it is found everywhere in nature
 glutamic amla or uske lavan kai prakaar ke anya yojyon main bhi maujuud rah sakate hai, jinamein shaamil hai, jal apaghatit vanaspatik protein, swatah vighatit khamir, jal apaghatit khamir, khamir kaa satv, soy satv or alag kiye gaye protein, jinhen inke in saamaanya or prachlit naamon se label karnaa hoga
 Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in "spices and flavorings"
 bhojan yojya, dysodium inosinet or dysodium guanillate, jo ribonucliotide hai, kaa upyog saamanytah monosodium glutamet-yukt ghatakon ke saath kiya jaataa he
 However, the term 'natural flavor' is used in the food-related industry when glutamic acid is being used
 epad viniman na hone ke kaaran, yah pataa karnaa sambhav nahin he ki 'kudarti swaad' kaa kitna pratishat vastav main glutamic amla he
 The FDA considers labels such as "no MSG" or "MSG not mixed" to be misleading if the food contains components that contain free glutamate, such as water-degraded protein
 1993 main, epad ne protein ke kuch jal apaghatit tatwon ke liye, jinamein kaaphi maatra main glutamet rahata ho, unke saadhaaran yaa prachlit naamon ke saath "" pad jodne kaa prastaav rakhaa tha

 mishael phuko france ke pramukh vichaarak or darshanik the
 Fuco is counted among the foremost thinkers of the 20th century
 yah phuko ke lekhon kaa hi prabhaav tha ki aadhunik vigyaan ke bahut se kshetron main or khaskar itihaas lekhan ke kshetra main krantikari parivartan huye
 The most recent and thought-provoking development in this understanding has been done by Michel Fuco - how the state's institution makes people listen to it
 poonjipati varg rajya main apni saamaajik satta keval hinsa ke upkarnon ke dwaara hi sthapit nahin karata
 He also ensures continuity of his social power by using a variety of cultural forms
 isliye rajya kii sanrachanaon ko unke saanskrithik roopon main samajhnaa bhi aavashyak he
 Ultimately, these cultural structures bear the responsibility of creating consensus in favor of the state
 phuko bataate hai ki aadhunik samaaj main logon ko niyantrit yaa anushaasit karne ke liye nigaraanee kii ek bahustareey vyavastha ke alaava dusron dwaara kiye gayi nirnyon ko aatmsaat karne tathaa pariksha pranali jaise upaay apanaaye jate hai
 Fuko insists that just keeping an eye on the people completes half the power
 iske liye ve stadium kii vyavastha kaa hawala dete hai jisamen siton kii vyavastha is tarah kii jaati he ki darshak kisi kaarykram ko aasaani se dekh paayen par saath hi yah vyavastha satta ke niyantrakon ko darshakon par nigaah rakhane kii sahuuliyat bhi pradaan karti he
 Fuco also mentions the prison punopticon conceived by political thinker Jeremy Bentham to mark the model of power of discipline and control
 jisaki mul vaastu-yojana kuch aisi thi ki kothriyon main band kaidi ek duusare ke liye to adrishy rahen lekin jail ke kendriya tower kii nigaraanee se baahar na ho paayen
 Prisoners never get to know whether they are being monitored or not, but there is a thought in their minds that someone keeps an eye on them
 phuko panoptican ke siddhant ko ek aise roopak kii tarah dekhte hai jo jail kii chauhaddi ke paar jaakar skulon, kaarkaanon or aspataalon main anushaasan kaa aam dharra ban jaataa he
 Although this proposed prison of Bantham was never able to materialize, but as a theory, it has occupied almost every activity of modern society
 aadhunik samaaj main anushaasan kaayam karne vaali vyavasthaaon ke liye vah ek aisa aujaar siddh hui he jisane praaq-aadhunik kaal ke raajaaon or hakimon ko apdasth kar unki jagah khud ko sthapit kar liya he
 In this sequence, Fuko also shows that the system governing modern power or discipline does not only monitor the activities of the people but also controls the people by showing their incompetence
 unke anusaar aadhunik satta samaj, pratibha, saamaanya or asaamaanya vyavhaar jaisi kotiyon kaa nirmaan karti he or jab koi vyakti iske dwaara sthapit kasautiyon yaa maanakon par karaa nahin utarataa to vyavastha aise vyakti ko kamatar yaa asaamaanya ghoshit karne kaa mauka nahin chookti
 In this context, Fuku does not forget to remind that this attitude of these disciplinary institutions of modern society is not driven by any kind of vengeance but by reform
 jiskaa antim lakshya yah hota he ki vyakti samaaj kii pradutt kasautiyon yaa maanakon ko sweekaar kar le
 Note that this method of discipline by the beliefs of the society is quite different from that system of judicial punishment in which a person was punished only on the basis of whether his act is lawful or not
 aise kisi faisale main yah nahin kaha jaataa tha ki vyakti saamaanya he yaa asaamaanya
 But modern society insists on setting certain standards in the matters of educational programs, medical practices and industry and products, and the dominance of these standards is so all-round that the behavior and personality of the individual starts to change accordingly
 saamanytah rajya ko shashan, sanghathan yaa raajnneetik samudaay ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 It is believed that its various forms have existed in every phase of history
 isamen hone vaale badlaav itihaas ke pramukh vishay rahe hai
 Only primitive nomadic political communities are not given the status of the state
 mana jaataa he ki in samudaayon main is avadharana ke saath- saath usase judi sunishchit vyavastha kaa abhaav hota he
 In fact, to be a state, it is necessary that there is a permanent relationship between the community and the territory
 is saamaanya tareeke se upyog kiye jane par yah shabd is vichaar ko abhivyakt karata he ki raajnneetik samudaay kii kuch aisi nishchit saarvbhaumik visheshtaayen hoti hai, jo samay or sthaan se pare hoti hai; arthath greek polis, madhyayugin regnum or aadhunik ganatantron ke bich kuch saamaanya visheshta hai
 Can this property or feature be defined more narrowly? yah baat to spasht he ki yadi rajya kii koi paribhaasha ise shaashvat or aparivartansheel vastu yaa sanghathan ke rup main pesh karti he, to aisa karke vah itihaas main badlaav or vikaas kii prakriya kii upeksha karti he
 Therefore a valid definition should focus on other aspects and functions
 itihaas yah dikhaata he ki ek saarvbhaumik parighatna ke rup main rajya ek aisi gatividhi yaa sanghathan he, jo manushya par aavashyaktaaon ke rup main thopi gayi he
 Some of its main features as an activity of this kind are as follows: It creates a definite connection between humans and their possessions; Or in other words it creates unity or society among humans
 isliye rajya kaa astitv vishisht taur par ek buniyadi chiz he
 Second, it accepts the connection between humans with the power of order, or a form of rule or command and obedience
 teesraa, rajya ko banane or kaayam rakhane vaali gatividhi vishisht hoti he, jo hameshaa khud ko un logon ke kilaaf pesh karti he, jo is samudaay kaa bhaag nahin hote hai
 However, despite seeing the state as a historical phenomenon, it cannot be denied that a philosophical aspect has always been involved in the writing on it
 iske tahat prashn uthta he ki rajya jis tarah kii vyavastha yaa logon ke bich sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta he, uskaa adarsh rup kya he? kya vah adarsh rup hasil kar liya gaya he? kya shashan kaa vartmaan tarika sahi he? kya samudaay ke bahari sambandhon ko sahi tareeke se sanchalit kiya ja rahaa he? asal main, is najariye se vichaar karne par rajya sirf manushyon par thopi gayi aavashyaktaa ke rup main hi saamne nahin aata he, balki yah manushyon ke saamne ‘sahi’ ke chunaav kii samasya ke rup main bhi saamne aata he
 There is no struggle to establish a system instead of just anarchy in the state
 isaki bajaay, yah ek aisi vyavastha sthapit karne kaa bhi sangharsh he, jo sachhee, pramanik or nyaaypurna ho
 Therefore, the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Hegel etc
 can be seen as an attempt to find a philosophical answer to the question of what the kingdom should be like
 in vidwaanon ne rajya or duusare tarah ke maanav- sanghathanon ke bich antar karne kii koshish kii he or iske saath hi inhone apane adarsh rajya kii pariklpana or uske paksh main tark bhi prastut kiye hai
 There is also a need to connect the idea of the state as a universal historical phenomenon and the idea of the state as a philosophical concept, especially the modern phenomenon
 aise bahut se itihaaskaar or raajnneetik sidghantkaar hai, jo yah tark dete hai ki ‘rajya’ shabd kaa upyog europe main punarjagran or dharm-sudhaar ke baad saamne aayi vyavastha ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 They believe that the principle of the state is in fact linked to this specific phenomenon
 isliye yadi iskaa prayog itihaas ke duusare daur main maujuud sanghathanon ke liye kiya jaataa he, to isse iske arth ke bare main bhram badhegaa
 The term state as an organized system also arose between the end of the fourteenth century and the seventeenth century
 rajya kaa angrezi shabd ‘state’ latin shabd ‘stair’ se niklaa he, jiskaa arth he khadaa hona
 In this way it tells about a situation
 rajya ko ek aadhunik avadharana maanane ke peeche ek mukhya vichaar yah bhi he ki aadhunik rajya kaa ubhaar prabhusatta kii avadharana ke saath hua
 It is a clear modern belief that a state which is not sovereign, is not a state in the true sense
 prabhusatta kaa arth yah he ki rajya apane adhikaar main aane vaale bhu-kshetra main raajnneetik praadhikaar kaa sarvocch strot he
 Sovereignty has two aspects - the internal aspect and the external aspect
 aantarik pahalu kaa arth he ki rajya kii simaaon ke bheetar rajya se unchaa koi bhi praadhikari nahin he
 The state is supreme and the citizen cannot appeal against any other authority against the state
 bahari prabhusatta kaa arth he— kisi vishisht rajya ko duusare rajyon dwaara di jane vaali manyata
 Also, it is also accepted that a state can speak on behalf of its citizens in international affairs
 yah adhikaar antarrashtriya daayre main rajya kii swaittata or prabhusatta ko vyakt karata he
 To consider the state as a modern phenomenon does not mean that it should also be dismissed as a historical entity or a philosophical idea
 yah bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik rajya kii koi bhi visheshta itihaas ke pehle ke daur main maujuud nahin thi
 In fact, many of the characteristics of the earlier 'states' of the modern era and the 'states' encountered with the modern era are similar
 isi tarah, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki ek darshanik vichaar ke rup main rajya aadhunik rajya kii ‘purna avadharana’ kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 In fact, philosophically, the concept of the state has been conceived and discussed in different ways
 masalan, udaarataavaadiyon ne rajyon ko ek ‘tatasth’ sanstha ke rup main dekha, lekin rajya kii bhoomika ke bare main udaarataavaad ke bheetar gambheer or vividh charchaa hoti rahi he
 Even within Marxism, there is a rich tradition of debate over the state
 isamen rajya ko poonjipati virgon kaa saadhan maanane ke saath hi ‘rajya kii saapekshik swaittata’ se judaa vaad-vivaad bhi shaamil rahaa he
 Anarchists have considered the state as an unnatural power and advocated its complete abolition
 marks-angels ke lekhan main bhi ek aisi samyavaadee sthiti kii kalpana kii gayi he, jisamen rajya puri tarah khatm ho jaayegaa
 But instead of waiting for such a situation, anarchists want to end the state as soon as possible
 inkaa maananaa he ki rajya manushya kii swaabhaavik prakruti ke kilaaf hinsa par aadhaarit he
 On the other hand, conservatives favor the state so that it can preserve the traditions and values accumulated over many generations
 nariwadiyon ke bheetar kii vibhinn dhaaraon main rajya ke bare main alag-alag tarah se vichaar kiya gaya he
 For example, liberal-feminism holds that the state as an institution is inclined towards male supremacy, but this trend of the state can be improved by making laws and using it to establish male-female equality
 can be done
 duusari ore, samaajawaadee-nariwad rajya ke poonjeewaadi charitra ko mahilaon kii samasya kaa mukhya kaaran maanata he
 It is believed that only the end of capitalist state can improve the condition of women
 teesraa, radical nariwadi vichaar ke mutabik rajya pitrusatta par aadhaarit parivaar or uske dwaara aage badhaaye jane vaale mulyon kii hifaazat kaa kaam karata he
 Therefore, to completely eliminate patriarchy, it is necessary to abolish the state
 spasht taur par, rajya, isaki prakruti or bhoomika ke bare main bahut vividh or gahan vaad-vivaad he
 In recent times, it has been argued that the state is slowly becoming irrelevant due to the emergence of structures like the European Union
 lekin yah tark bahut majboot nahin he
 It is true that the countries involved in the European Union have given their consent to form a strong regional organization
 phir bhi, ve ek raashtra-rajya ke rup main apni-apni pahchaan khatm nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Many other regional organizations have also increased cooperation between the countries of the region, but there is no possibility that they will prove to be an alternative to the nation-state
 samakaleen duniya main rajya ek aisi hakeekat he, jiske khatm hone kaa koi asaar nahin he
 Followers of many ideologies opposing it ideologically have failed to finish the institution of the state even if given a practical opportunity

 So far, the entire part of the universe has been revealed, there are estimated to be about 19 billion sky Ganges and there are about 10 billion stars in each sky Ganges
 akaash ganga kaa vyas lagbhag ek lakh prakashavarsh he
 The primitive organism was born on our earth 2 billion years ago and man's incarnation on earth happened 10-20 million years ago
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he
 The Sun is an average star with nine main planets, Earth being one of them
 is brahmad main har ek tara surya sadrush he
 There are many stars in front of which their sun does not even equal to a molecule
 jaise surya ke grah hai or un sabko milakar ham saura parivaar ke naam se pukaarte hai, usee prakaar harek taare kaa apana apana parivaar he
 Many people think that the Sun is stable, but the entire solar family is also moving at a speed of 13 miles per second under the local constellation system

 The distance between wires adjacent to each other can be billions of miles
 jab sate hue taron kaa yah haal he to dur dur sthit taron ke bich kii duuri aisi gananaatit he jise kah paanaa mushkil he
 For this reason, long distances between stars and other light years are measured
 ek prakashavarsh vah duuri he jo duuri prakaash ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar mile prati second kii gati se ek varsh main tay karata he
 For example, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 125 million miles, light travels this distance in a quarter to eight minutes
 at: prithvi se surya kii duuri sava aath prakaash minute hui
 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he
 In this situation we will not be able to express these distances in miles and neither will we understand anything
 isiilie prakashavarsh kii ikai kaa vaigyanikon ne prayog kiya he
 Suppose there is nothing very far after any other constellations of the universe, etc
, but this thing cannot be final

 bahut pehle koparnicus, tiko brahe or mukhyat: capler ne khagol vidya main mahatvaparnu kaary kiya tha
 The three laws that Kepler has proposed in relation to the motion of planets remain the cornerstone of astrophysics
 khagol vidya main newton kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn rahaa he
 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations
 newton ke anusaar do pindon ke bich kii guru tvkarshan shakti ek duusare par tatkaal prabhaav daalati he lekin ainstin ne yah sabit kar diya ki parsparik guru tvkarshan kii shakti kii gati prakaash kii gati ke samaan teevr nahin ho sakati he
 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 unako phir faraao kii patni ne paala or musa ek misri rajkumaar bane
 Later Moses came to know that he was a Jew and his Jewish nation was suffering persecution
 musa kaa ek pahaad par parameshwar se saakshaatkaar hua or parameshwar kii madad se unhone faraao ko haraakar yahudiyon ko azaad karaayaa or misr se ek nayi bhoomi israel pahunchaaya

 Yes, the amount of alcohol and the expected capacity to bring intoxication is different, but we all call it 'alcohol'
 kabhi-kabhi log hadiya yaa bear ko sharaab se alag samajhate hai jo ki bilkul galat he
 Both contain alcohol
 sharaab aksar hamaare samaaj main anand ke liye pi jaati he
 Most of the onset is due to the influence or pressure of friends and later on people continue to consume it due to many other reasons
 jaise- boriyat mitaane ke liye, khushi manaane ke liye, avsaad main, chintaa main, teevr krodh yaa aaveg aane par, atmavishwaas laane ke liye yaa mood banane ke liye aadi
 Apart from this, the consumption of alcohol is also associated with religious and other social rituals in many societies
 parantu koi bhi samaaj yaa dharm iske durupyog kii sweekruti nahin detaa he
 Frequent consumption of alcohol causes some characteristic symptoms, on the basis of which it can be identified
 jaise- When people continue to consume alcohol, gradually it becomes such a habit that it becomes difficult to quit
 vah vyakti ke jivan kaa abhinn ang ban jaataa he
 There are many types of physical and mental problems when trying to quit and a person is forced to consume it continuously

 Alcohol leaves its bad effect on almost all the parts of the body and hardly any part of the body is deprived of its side effects
 sharaab se pet sambandhi bimariyaan jaise- apach, pet ke dhav, yakrut kii beemaari jaise-serosis, liver kaa puri tarah se kshatigrast hona, snaayu tantra kii kamajoriyaan, hriday sambandhi rog visheshtah raktchaap, yadast kii beemaari, cancer aadi

 Corruption has been a major topic of discussion and movements in India
 aazaadee ke ek dashak baad se hi bharat bhrashtachar ke daldal main dhansa najar aane laga tha or us samay sansad main is baat par bahes bhi hoti thi
 The speech given by Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia in the debate on the eradication of corruption in India on 21 December 1963 is still relevant today
 us vakt dow lohia ne kaha tha singhaasana or vyapaar ke bich sambandh bharat main jitna dooshit, bhrasht or beyimaan ho gaya he utana duniya ke itihaas main kahin nahin hua he
 Corruption has an adverse effect on the country's economy and every individual

 Apart from this, corruption is also prevalent in judiciary, media, army, police etc

 The report of the same institution presented in the year 2008 has stated that in India about 20 crores of bribes are given to different public servants
 unheen kaa yah nishkarsh he ki bharat main police kar ekatra karne vaale vibhaagon main sabase zyada bhrashtachar he
 Today it is a harsh truth that no house is allowed in any city municipal corporation without paying bribe
 isi prakaar saamaanya vyakti bhi yah maanakar chalata he ki kisi bhi sarkari mahakme main paisa diye bagaiyr gaadi nahin chalati
 Corruption means corrupt + ethics
 bhrasht yani bura yaa bigadaa hua tathaa aachaar kaa matlab he aacharan
 That is, corruption literally means conduct that is in any way immoral and inappropriate
 kisi ko nirnay lene kaa adhikaar miltaa he to vah ek yaa duusare paksh main nirnay le saktaa he
 This is its discretion and is also a symptom of a successful democracy
 parantu jab yah vivekadhikaar vastuparak na hokar duusare kaarnon ke aadhaar par istemaal kiya jaataa he tab yah bhrashtachar kii shrenee main aa jaataa he athwa ise karne vaala vyakti bhrasht kehalaata he
 When a decision is made by a government official due to money or any other greed, it is called corruption

 Due to which the Government of India has been forced to create anti-corruption Act-1988, Citizen Charter, Right to Information Act-2005, Commission of Inquiry Act etc
 angrejon ne bharat ke raja maharaajaaon ko bhrasht karke bharat ko gulam banaaya
 He then systematically promoted corruption in India and used it as an effective weapon to enslave corruption
