 In 1921 AD, the British defeated Turkey, and overthrew the Sultan, the same Sultan was also known as the Khalifa / Chief of Muslims, this thing was exorcised by the Muslims of India and other Muslim countries, which led to movements everywhere
 The movement took a violent form in Hindusthan, especially in Malabar district of Kerala

 Thus on 28 / 9 / 1925, his father-like guru Dr
 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, his disciples Dr
 Hedgewar, Mr
 Paranjpe and Bapu Sahib Soni laid the foundation of a Hindu youth club, which was later renamed the National self-service Association

 In this, all the people who believe in and practice the views of religions and religions like Sanatani, Aryasamaji, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh etc
 are Hindu The Muslims and Christians did not fall under this definition, so it was decided not to take them in this militia and it was decided to take only Hindus, the main mantra
 Was "prevention of Ambiguity and Military Causes of Hindus"

 Prayers also came to be known as "prayers" started in Sanskrit language instead of Marathi
 For senior volunteers, OTC Camps were started where they were also given paramilitary education
 For all these works, the services of a retired military officer Mr
 Martande Rao Jog were used
 By 1935-36 such branches were limited to Maharashtra only and its volunteers
 The number was only a few thousand, but the enthusiasm of the Sarsanghchalak and volunteers was worth seeing
 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis
 " jab vir saavarkar ratnagiri main drushti band the, tab dow headgavar vahaan unase milane gayi
 By then he had also read the book Hindutva by Veer Savarkar
 dow headgavar us pustak ke vichaaron se bahut prabhavit hue or uski saraahna karte hue bole ki “vir saavarkar ek adarsh vyakti he”
 Both believed that Hindus would be divided into casteism, untouchability, urban-migrants and regionalism, till Hindus would not leave blind faith, old orthodox thinking, religious fanatics, and until it would be organized and united, Until then, he will not be able to take his rightful place in the world

 If Hindi literature is considered in proper perspective then it is clear that the history of Hindi literature is very detailed and ancient
 suprasiddh bhashaa vaigyanik dow0 hardev bahari ke shabdon main, hindi sahitya kaa itihaas vastutah vaidic kaal se armbh hota he
 It is only right to say that Vedic language is Hindi
 is bhashaa kaa durbhaagya rahaa he ki yug-yug main iskaa naam parivartit hota rahaa he
 Sometimes 'vedic', sometimes 'sanskrit', sometimes 'prakrit', sometimes 'apabhransh' and now - Hindi
 aalochak kah sakate hai ki 'vaidic sanskrit' or 'hindi' main to jameen-aasmaan kaa antar he
 But it is worth noting that the languages of Hebrew, Russian, Chinese, German and Tamil etc
 which are described as 'very old' also have a difference of ground and sky in the ancient and present forms; But people did not change the names of those languages and their changed forms were called 'ancient', 'medieval', 'modern' etc
, whereas in the context of 'hindi', the language of each era was renamed
 hindi bhashaa ke udbhav or vikaas ke sambandh main prachlit dharanaon par vichaar karte samay hamaare saamne hindi bhashaa kii utpatti kaa prashn dasvin shatabdi ke aasapaas kii prakritabhas bhashaa tathaa apbhransh bhashaaon kii ore jaataa he
 It is also necessary to consider the rationale and evidence presented in the history books of Hindi literature to establish the etymology of the word Apabhramsa and the relationship of Hindi to the Apabhramsa works of Jain creators
 saamanytah praakrit kii antim apbhransh-avasthaa se hi hindi sahitya kaa aavirbhaav sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 At that time, there were many forms of apabhramsa and in them the verse-making started from the seventh-eighth century
 sahitya kii drushti se padhyabaddh jo rachanaayen milti hai ve doha rup main hi hai or unke vishay, dharm, niti, upadesh aadi pramukh hai
 Rajashrita used to show his literary interest by describing poets and bard policy, sringar, valor, valor etc
 yah rachana-parampara aage chalakar shauraseni apbhransh yaa 'prakritabhas hindi' main kai varshon tak chalati rahi
 The use of the old apostrophe language and the native language of the colloquium continued to grow
 is bhashaa ko vidyapati ne desi bhashaa kaha he, kintu yah nirnay karnaa saral nahin he ki hindi shabd kaa prayog is bhashaa ke liye kab or kis desh main prarambh hua
 Yes, it can definitely be said that initially the word Hindi was used by foreign Muslims
 is shabd se unka taatpary 'bhartiya bhashaa' kaa tha
 From the earliest period to modern and post-modern period, the names of literature history writers can be counted
 hindi sahitya ke itihaas shabdabaddh karne kaa prashn adhik mahatvapurn tha
 The main historians of Hindi literature and their texts are as follows - 1

 babu gulab raay : hindi sahitya kaa subodh itihaas Hindi literature is believed to have started from the eighth century

 They also used to compete with foreign Muslims
 dharmik kshetra astavyast the
 These days Buddhism was preached in many parts of North India
 buddha dharm kaa vikaas kai roopon main hua jinamein se ek vajrayan kahalaaya
 Vajrayani was a tantric and was called Siddha
 inhone janata ke bich us samay kii lokbhasha main apane mat kaa prachaar kiya
 The oldest literature of Hindi was written by these Vajrayani Siddhas in the immediate Hindi language
 iske baad nathpanthi saadhuon kaa samay aata he
 He started his new creed with a mixture of Buddhist, Shankar, Tantra, Yoga and Shaivism, giving a general view of religion to all classes and varnas
 lokprachlit puraani hindi main likhi inaki anek dharmik rachanaayen uplabdh hai
 After this, compositions of Jains are found
 swayambhu kaa "paumchariu' athwa ramayana aathvin shatabdi kii rachana he
 The creations of Buddhists and Nathpanthis are liberating and just religious, but many of the Jains are also related to the common sensations of life
 inamen se kai prabandhkavy hai
 In the same period, Abdurrahman's poem "sandeshrasak" was also written in which language is found near the later colloquial
 is prakaar gyarahavin shatabdi tak puraani hindi kaa rup nirmit or viksit hota rahaa
 Around the eleventh century, the language of the country language started becoming more vibrant
 us samay pashchimi hindi pradesh main anek chote chote rajput rajya sthapit ho gaye the
 They were often at war with each other or foreign invaders
 inhen raajaaon ke sangrakshan main rahanevaale chaarnon or bhaaton kaa rajprashastimulak kavy virgatha ke naam se abhihit kiya gaya
 These heroines are called Raso
 inamen ashrayadata raajaaon ke shaury or parakram kaa ojasvi varnan karne ke saath hi unke premaprasangon kaa bhi ullekh he
 Love is often shown to be the cause of conflict in Raso texts
 in rachanaaon main itihaas or kalpana kaa mishran he
 Raso Veerageet and Prabandhakavya - written in these two forms
 in raso granthon main se anek kii uplabdh pratiyaan chaahe aitihaasik drushti se sandigdh hon par in virgthaon kii maukhik parampara ansadigdh he
 In them, there is an expression of bravery and love
 isi kalavadhi main maithil kokil vidyapati hue jinaki padaavalee main maanviya saundarya ore prem kii anupam vyanjana milti he
 Kirtilata and Kirtipataka are two other famous books of his
 amir khusro kaa bhi yahi samay he
 He has composed many puzzles, retorts and two sakhuns in typical Khadi dialect

 The superstitions practiced by Siddhas and Yogis etc
 are spreading in public
 the, shastragyansampann varg main bhi roodhiyon or aadambar kii pradhanta ho chali thi
 Due to the influence of Mayanism, feelings of public opinion and inaction were beginning to flourish in the society
 aise samay main bhaktiandolan ke rup main aisa bharatvyaapee vishaal saanskrithik andolan uthaa jisane samaaj main uthkarshvidhayak saamaajik or vaiyaktik mulyon kii pratishtha kii
 The Bhakti movement began around the tenth century by the Alwar saints of the south
 vahaan shankaracharya ke advaitamat or mayawad ke virodh main chaar vaishnav sampradaay khadey hue
 These four sects propagated the incarnations of Vishnu in North India
 inamen se ek ke pravartak ramanujacharya the, jinaki shishyparampara main aanevaale ramanand ne uttar bharat main rambhakti kaa prachaar kiya
 Ramananda's Rama was a replacement for Brahma who incarnated in the world to destroy the demons and expand his pastimes
 bhakthi ke kshetra main ramanand ne oonchnich kaa bhedbhaav mitaane par vishesh bal diya
 He influenced two devotees - Kabir and Tulsi, who believed in the two forms of Ram's virtue and nirguna
 vishnuswami ke shuddhadvait mat kaa aadhaar lekar isi samay vallabhacharya ne apana pushtimaarg chalaaya
 From the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries a number of cults were established throughout the country on the basis of Puranasamat Krishnanacharitra, the most influential of which was the confirmation of Vallabh
 unhone shankar mat ke viruddh brahm ke sagun rup ko hi vaastavik kaha
 According to his opinion, this world is not a spread of falsehood or maya, but is a spread of Brahma, so it is true
 unhone krishna ko brahm kaa avatar mana or uski prapti ke liye bhakt kaa purna aatmasamarpan aavashyak batalaaya
 Devotion can be attained only by the grace or affirmation of God
 is sampradaay main upasna ke liye gopisenvallabh, lilapurushottam krishna kaa madhur rup sweekrut hua
 Thus in northern India, Vishnu's Rama and Krishna avatars became prominent
 is prakaar in vibhinn maton kaa aadhaar lekar hindi main nirgun or sagun ke naam se bhakthikavy kii do shakhaayen saath saath chalin
 There are two subdivisions of Nirgunamat - Gyanashrayi and Premashrayi
 pehle ke pratinidhi kabir or duusare ke jaaysi hai
 Sagunmat also flowed into two sub-sections - Rambhakti and Krishnabhakti
 pehle ke pratinidhi tulsi hai or duusare ke surdaas
 Kabir, the principal poet of the Jnanasrayi branch, has a combined influence of various religious trends and philosophical beliefs
 unki rachanaaon main dharmasudharak or samajasudharak kaa rup vishesh prakhar he
 He stressed the correctness of conduct
 bahyadambar, roodhiyon or andhvishwaason par unhone teevr kashaghat kiya
 By proclaiming the ability of humans, he aroused a sense of self-respect among the people of the lower class
 is shakha ke anya kavi raidas, dadu hai
 The most prominent poet of Premashrayi Dhara is Jayasi, whose "padmavat" has been specially praised for its poignant lovemaking, Katharas and natural art
 inaki anya rachanaaon main "akharavat' or "aakhri kalam' aadi hai, jinamein sufi sampradaaysangat baaten hai
 Other poets of this stream are Qutuban, Manjhan, Usman, Sheikh Nabi and Noor Muhammad etc
 aaj kii drushti se is sampurna bhakthikavy kaa mahatv uski dharmikata se adhik lokajeevanagat maanviya anubhutiyon or bhaavon ke kaaran he
 With this thought, devotees can be called the golden age of Hindi poetry
 1700 i
 ke aas paas hindi kavita main ek nayaa mode aayaa
 This was particularly stimulated by the immediate court culture and Sanskritic literature
 sanskrit sahityashastra ke katipay anshon ne use shastreey anushaasan kii ore pravrutt kiya
 In Hindi, the word 'riti' or 'poetry' was used for poetry
 isliye kavyashastrabaddh saamaanya srujanpravriti or ras, alankaar aadi ke nirupak bahusankhyak lakshangranthon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is samay ke kavy ko 'reetikavy' kaha gaya
 The clearest signs of the old tradition of the poetic trends of this poetry are found in the adhikavya of Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhransh, Persian and Hindi and the sringari tendencies of Krishnakavya
 reetikavy rachana kaa aarambh ek sanskritgya ne kiya
 These were Acharya Keshavdas, whose famous compositions are Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Ramachandrika
 keshav ke kai dashak baad chintamani se lekar atharahavin sadi tak hindi main reetikavy kaa ajasr strot pravaahit hua jisamen nar-nari-jivan ke romantic pakshon or tatsambandhi saras samvednaaon kii atyant kalatmak abhivyakti vyapak rup main hui
 The poets of Reetikal lived in the shelter of kings and nobles
 vahaan manoranjan or kalavilas kaa vaataavaran swaabhaavik tha
 The main means of intellectual enjoyment was considered idiomatic there
 aise vaataavaran main likhaa gaya sahitya adhiktar shringarmulak or kalavaichitraya se yukt tha
 But at the same time, there were also independent singers of Prem who have touched the depths of love
 maatra or kavyagun donon hi drushtiyon se is samay kaa nar-nari-prem or saundarya kii maarmik vyanjana karanevaala kavyasahitya mahatvapurn he
 Ritikavya is primarily a poetry of fleshy makeup
 isamen nar-narijivan ke smaraneey pakshon kaa sundar udghaatan hua he
 The more poetic is in the Muktak style, but there are also the Manavakyas
 in do sau varshon main shringaarakavy kaa apurv utkarsh hua
 But slowly the rituals grew and the poetry of Hindi poetry became narrow
 aadhunik yug tak aate aate in donon kamiyon kii ore sahityakaron kaa dhyaan vishesh rup se aakrisht hua
 See also - yah aadhunik yug kaa aarambh kaal he jab bharatiyon kaa europea samskruti se sampark hua
 In the work of establishing its roots in India, the British rule influenced and agitated Indian life at various levels
 nai paristhitiyon ke dhakke se sthitisheel jivanavidhi kaa dhaanchaa tuutane laga
 a new era of consciousness began
 sangharsh or saamanjasy ke nae aayam saamne aae
 The highest possibilities of New Age literature were rooted in Khadi Boli prose, so it is also called prose-era
 hindi kaa pracheen gadhy rajasthani, maithili or brajabhasha main miltaa he par vah sahitya kaa vyapak madhyam banane main ashakt tha
 The tradition of Khadiboli is ancient
 amir khusro se lekar madhyakaalin bhushan tak ke kavy main iske udhaaharan bikhare pade hai
 Old samples of Khadi Boli prose have also been found
 is tarah kaa bahut sa gadhy farsi or gurumukhi lipi main likhaa gaya he
 It developed in the name of "dakshini" in the Muslim principalities of the South
 atharahavin sadi main likhaa gaya ramprasad niranjani or daulataraam kaa gadhy uplabdh he
 But the Hindi prologue prose of Hindi as a conductor of the new era was widely spread since the nineteenth century
 kalkatte ke fort wiliam kalege main, navaagat angarej afasaron ke upyog ke liye, lallu laal tathaa sadal mishra ne gadhy kii pustaken likhakar hindi ke khadi boli gadhy kii purvaparampara ke vikaas main kuch sahaayta di
 The prose compositions of Munshi Sadasukhlal and Insha Alla Khan were written at this time
 aage chalakar press, patrapatrikaon, isai dharmprachaarkon tathaa naveen shiksha sansthaaon se hindi gadhy ke vikaas main sahaayta mili
 Residents of various provinces like Bengal, Punjab, Gujarat etc
 also contributed to its growth and spread
 hindi kaa pehla samachaarpatr "udant maartand' 1826 i
 main kalkatte se prakashit hua
 King Shivprasad and Raja Laxman Singh were instrumental in the creation and propagation of Hindi prose in their own way
 aryasamaj or anya saanskrithik andolanon ne bhi aadhunik gadhy ko aage badhaayaa
 The evolving tradition of prose literature began from the late nineteenth century
 iske pravartak aadhunik yug ke pravartak or pathpradarshak bhaaratendu harishchandra the jinhone sahitya kaa samakaleen jivan se ghanishtha sambandh sthapit kiya
 This was the era of solstice and renaissance
 angarejon kii kootnithik chaalon or aarthik shoshan se janata santrast or kshubdh thi
 While one section of the society was beset by Western rites, the other class was stuck in stereotypes
 isi samay nai shiksha kaa aarambh hua or saamaajik sudhaar ke andolan chale
 With the influence of new knowledge science, a new attitude towards life developed among the newly educated who was specially oriented towards present and future rather than past
 saamaajik vikaas main utpann aasthaa or jaagrath samudayachetana ne bharatiyon main jivan ke prati nayaa utsaah utpann kiya
 Contemporary literature of Bharatendu, especially in prose literature, gave a clear and live expression of the various stages of the then ideological and physical environment
 is yug kii naveen rachanaayen deshbhakti or samajasudhar kii bhaavana se paripurna hai
 The tendency of political and social satire also emerged due to the clash of many new situations
 is samay ke gadhy main bolchaal kii sajivta he
 Due to the personality of the writers, it has added enough interestingness to it
 sabase adhik niabandh likhe gaye jo vyaktipradhan or vichaarpradhan tathaa varnanaatmak bhi the
 Storytelling was also written in many genres, mostly educative
 par yathartwaadee drushti or nae shilp kii vishistataa shrinivas das ke "parikshaguru' main hi he
 [[devakinandan Khatri's Tilasmi novel 'chandrakanta' was published at this time
 paryaapt pariman main naatakon or saamaajik prahasanon kii rachana hui
 Bharatendu, Pratapnarayan Mishra, Srinivasa Das, etc
 are prominent playwrights
 saath hi bhakthi or shringaar kii bahut si saras kavitaayen bhi nirmit hui
 But the poems in which social sentiments were expressed give an initial impression of the creativity of the new era
 khadi boli ke chhitroot prayogon ko chhod shesh kavitaayen brajabhasha main likhi gayin
 In fact, the new era was more rewarded in prose of this time
 is kalavadhi kii sabase mahatvapurn ghatnaayen do hai - ek to saamaanya kavyabhasha ke rup main khadi boli kii sweekruti or duusare hindi gadhy kaa niyaman or parimarjan
 The most powerful yoga in this work was that of Saraswati editor Mahavirprasad Dwivedi
 dvivedi ji or unke sahakarmiyon ne hindi gadhy kii abhivyaktikshmata ko viksit kiya
 In addition to Dwivedi in the field of essays, one to one careful, vigorous and lively prose stylists such as Balmukund, Chandradhar Sharma Guleri, Purnasingh, Padmasinh Sharma emerged
 upanyaas anek likhe gaye par uski yathartwaadee parampara kaa ullekhneey vikaas na ho sakaa
 Realistic modern stories were born and developed during this period
 guleri, kowshik aadi ke atirikt premchand or prasad kii bhi aarambhik kahaniyaan isi samay prakaash main ai
 The area of the drama was definitely deserted
 is samay ke sabase prabhaavshaalee sameekshak dvivedi ji the jinaki sanshodhanavaadee or maryaadanishth aalochana ne anek samakaleen sahitya ko paryaapt prabhavit kiya
 Mishrabandhu, Krishnabihari Mishra and Padmasinh Sharma are the other reviewers at this time, but overall the review of this period has been outwardly dominant
 sudhaarwadi aadarshon se prerit ayodhyasingh upaadhyaay ne apane "priypravas' main radha kaa loksevika rup prastut kiya or khadiboli ke vibhinn roopon ke prayog main nipunata bhi pradarshit kii
 Maithilisharan Gupta raised the voice of nationalism and social reform in "bharat Bharti" and revered Urmila in "saket"
 is samay ke anya kavi dvivedi ji, shridhar pathak, balmukund gupt, nathuram sharma 'shankar', gaya prasad shukla 'sanehi' aadi hai
 The representatives of Brajbhasha poetic tradition are Ratnakar and Satyanarayana Kaviratna
 is samay khadi boli kavyabhasha ke parimarjan or samayik parivesh ke anuroop rachana kaa kaary sampann hua
 Much of the new poetry is thoughtful and descriptive
 san 1920-40 ke do dashakon main aadhunik sahitya ke antargat vaicharik or kalatmak pravritiyon kaa anek rup utkarsh dikhaai padaa
 Novel and story received the highest popularity
 kathasahitya main ghatnavaichity kii jagah jite jaagate smaraneey charitron kii sristi hui

 Many other playwrights also appeared active

 The sense of social contrast and class struggle became particularly vocal in this
 isane sahitya ko saamaajik kranti ke astr ke rup main grahan kiya
 Progressive literature, especially poetry, did not have much potential for artistic flourish due to the limitations of its utilitarian vision, yet it awakened a new consciousness by emphasizing the social side of literature
 pragativaadee andolan ke aarambh ke kuch hi baad nae manovigyaan yaa manovishleshanshastra se prabhavit ek or vyaktivaadee pravriti sahitya ke kshetra main sakriy hui thi jise san 1943 ke baad prayogwaad naam diya gaya
 The modified form of this is the present day new poetry and new stories
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki dwitiya mahayuddh or uske uttarkalin sahitya main jivan kii vibheeshikaa, kurupata or asangatiyon ke prati ansatosh tathaa kshobh ne kuch aage peeche do prakaar kii pravritiyon ko janm diya
 One is Progressivism, which draws inspiration from Marx's materialistic biography; The second is experimentalism, which expressed the rapid reactions of its dissatisfaction to traditional ideals and institutions through innovative forms of literature
 isapar nae manovigyaan kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 Among the storytellers influenced by progressivism are Yashpal, Upendranath Ashk, Amritlal Nagar and Nagarjuna

'' Leprosy or Hansen's disease, named after physician Gerhard Armor Hansen, is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis
 kushtarog mukhyatah upree shwasan tantra ke shleshm or bahya nason kii ek granuloma-sambandhi beemaari he; twachaa par ghaav iske praathmik bahya sanket hai
 If left untreated, leprosy may develop, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, extremities, and eyes
 lokkathaon ke vipareet, kushtarog ke kaaran sharir ke ang alag hokar girte nahin, haalanki is beemaari ke kaaran ve sunn tathaa / yaa rogi ban sakate hai
 Leprosy has influenced humanity for more than 4,000 years, and has been very well recognized in the civilizations of ancient China, Egypt and India

 In 1995, the World Health Organization estimates that the number of persons with permanent leprosy due to leprosy was between 2 and 3 million
 pichley 20 varshon main, puure vishwa main 15 million logon ko kushtarog se mukt kiya ja chukaa he
 However, forceful quarantine or segregation of patients is unnecessary in places where adequate treatments are available, but still there is still leprosy in countries like India, China, Romania, Egypt, Nepal, Somalia, Liberia, Vietnam and Japan all over the world
 - Settlements exist

 It is now believed that there may have been many cases of syphilis from early cases of leprosy
 It is now known that leprosy is neither transmitted through sexual contact nor is highly contagious after treatment because about 95% of people are naturally immunized and people suffering from it also after only 2 weeks of treatment They do not remain contagious

 yah ek aakasmik durghatana thi: landan ke saint maries hospital ke tahkhaane main sthit apni prayogshaala main fleming ne gaur kiya ki stefilococus plate culture sahit jeevanuon vaale ek paatr ko unhone galati se khulaa chhod diya tha, jo nile-hare saanche se sandooshit ho gaya tha, jiskaa vikaas drishyman tha
 a circle of oppressive bacteria was growing around that mold
 fleming ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki vah sancha ek padaarth nikaal rahaa tha jo is vikaas ko roak rahaa tha evam jeevanuon ko maar rahaa tha
 He developed a pure culture and found that it was a Penicillium mold, now known as Penicillium notetum

 He initially hoped that penicillin would be a useful disinfectant, which would be extremely potent with minimal toxicity compared to the antimicrobials available today, and also noted the laboratory importance of "bacillus influenza"
 aagaamee prayogon ke baad, fleming aashwast hue ki penicillin rogajanak jeevanuon ko maarane ke liye maanav sharir main adhik der tak nahin tik saktaa, evam 1931 ke baad unhone iskaa adhyayan band kar diya
 He resumed clinical trials in 1934 and continued to search for a suitable person for its purification until 1940

 MIT chemist John C
 Sheehan completed the first total synthesis of penicillin and some of its analogues in the first half of the 1950s but their methods were not suitable for mass production
 is dawa ke maas-production kii chunauti kathin thi
 On March 14, 1942, the first patient was treated for streptococcal septicemia with us-made penicillin, manufactured by Merck and Company
 Half of the total supply produced at that time was used to treat that single patient

 During World War II, penicillin caused a huge difference in the number of amputations caused by Allied casualties and infected wounds, saving an estimated 12% –15% of lives

 Penicillin is actively excreted and about 80% of the penicillin dose is released from the body within three or four hours of administration
 vastav main praarambhik penicillin yug ke dauraan yah dawa itani durlabh thi evam isaki keemat itani zyaada thi ki ilaaj kiye ja rahe rogiyon kaa mutr ikaitha karnaa aam ban gaya tha, taaki mutr main maujuud penicillin ko alag kiya ja sake evam use punah upyog main laayaa ja sake
 This was not a satisfactory solution, so researchers began to find a way to slow down the excretion of penicillin
 unhone ek aisa anu dhund nikaalane kii aashaa jataai jo utsarjan ke liye daayi carbonic amla parivahak ke liye penicillin se muqaabala kar sake, kuch aisa taaki parivahak adhimaanatah muqabla karne vaale anuon ko utsarjit kare evam penicillin bachaa rahe
 Eurycosuric agent probenecid was proved suitable
 jab probenacid evam penicillin ek saath die jate hai, to probenacid penicillin ke utsarjan ko pratispardhaatmak rup se roktaa he evam penicillin kii ekaagratha evam dirghakaalik sakriyata ko bachaa kar rakhata he
 Eventually, the advent of mass-production techniques and semi-synthetic penicillins solved the supply problem, so this use of probenecid ended
 baharhaal kuch aise sankramanon ke liye jinamein khaas taur par penicillin kii ucch ekaagratha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, probenacid aaj bhi upyogi he
 The weak range of orally active phenoxyethylphenicillin with a narrow range of curable diseases or the spectrum of activity of penicillin led to the discovery of a homologous form of penicillin, to treat a wider range of infections
 6-apie ke algaav, penicillin ke centre ne benzilpenicillin main vibhinn sudhaaron ke saath semisynthetic penicillinon ko taiyaar karne kii anumati di
 The first major development was ampicillin, which provided a wider range of activities than all the original penicillins
 Further development led to the production of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin, including flucloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and methicillin
 ye sabhi beta-lactamez-bacteria prajatiyon ke viruddh unki gatividhiyon ke liye mahatvapurn thi, lekin methicilin-pratirodhi stefilococus orius ke prati aprabhavi thi, jo baad main paidaa hui
 In fact, another development of the line of penicillins was antisudomonal penicillin, a drug useful for its activities against gram-negative bacteria like carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and piperacillin
 baharhaal, beta-lectom ring kuch aisa tha ki mesilinams, carbapenems, evam sabase mahatvapurn sephalosporince sahit sambandhit antibiotic apane dhaanche ke centre main ab bhi use banaae hue hai
 β-lactam antibiotic works by inhibiting the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall
 penicillin kaa β-lactem moity anzime -transpapatides) se baandh detaa he, jo jeevanuon ke paptidoglaiken anuon se judata he, jisase bacterium kii koshika diwaar kamazor ho jaati he iske alaava paptidoglaiken pricursor jeevanugat koshika kii diwaar ke hydrolysis evam autolicins kii sakriyata ko or badhaata he, jo aage chal kar bacteria ke maujuuda paptidoglaiken ko pachaata he
 Gram-positive bacteria, when they lose their cell walls, are called protoplasts
 gram-negative jeevanu apni koshika diwaar purnatah nahin khote evam penicillin se ilaaj ke baad unhen spheroplast kaha jaataa he
 Penicillin shows a synergistic effect with aminoglycosides, because inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis allows the aminoglycosides to more easily penetrate the bacterial cell wall, facilitating the disruption of bacterial protein synthesis within the cell itself
 iske parinamswaroop atisamvedansheel andrik rachana ke liye embisi kaa str kam ho jaataa he
 Like other β-lactam antibiotics, penicillin blocks not only the part of cyanobacteria, parts of the vulcan cyanel, the photosynthetic cell membrane of glucophytes, and the chloroplast part of the bryophytes

 Other types include: penicillin ke prayog se sambandhit dawa kii aam pratikul pratikriya main dast, atisamvedansheeltaa, matlee, dadore, neurotoxity, pitti or atyadhik sankraman shaamil hai
 Unusual adverse effects include fever, vomiting, reddening of the skin, skin inflammation, angiodema, staining, and large enteritis of the prosthetic membrane

 The by-product L-lysine inhibits the production of homocitrate, so the presence of excreted lysine in penicillin production should be avoided

 1864 ke aarambh main, wiliam haggins ne lagbhag 70 niharikaon ke spectra yaa shrenee kii jaanch kii
 unhone paaya ki unamem se lagbhag ek tihaai main gas ke samavesh kii vistrut shrenee thi
 The rest appeared to have an ever-widening range and were considered a cluster of stars
 1912 main, jab vesto sleefer ne yah darshaya ki merope taare ke aasapaas kii niharikaon kii shrenee pliyedas khule taraguchh se milti he, tab inamen ek teesraa varg joda gaya
 Thus the nebula shines through the reflected light of the stars
 sleefer or edwin habal ne anek visarit niharikaon se inaki vistrut shreniyon ko ekatra karnaa jari rakhaa tathaa pataa lagaaya ki inamen se 29 utsarjan spectra dikhaate hai or 33 main taron ke prakaash kaa satat spectra tha
 In 1922, Hubble announced that almost all the nebulae are associated with stars, and that their light comes from starlight
 unhone yah bhi pataa lagaaya ki utsarjan spectrum kii niharikaayen lagbhag hameshaa B1 yaa usase adhik garm se judy rahati hai, jabaki satat spectra yukt niharikaayen apekshaakrit thande taron ke saath prakat hoti hai
 Both Hubble and Henry Norris Russell conclude that the nebulae surrounding the hot stars are changing in some way
 anek niharikaon kaa gathan antartaarkeey madhyam main gas ke aapasi gurutvkarshan kii vajah se hota he
 Due to the constriction of matter under its own weight, many massive stars can be formed in the center and their ultraviolet light ionizes the surrounding gases and makes them visible on light waves
 rojet nebyal or pelicon nebyal is prakaar kii niharikaon ke udhaaharan hai
 The size of these types of nebulae, known as the HII region, depends on the size of the actual clouds of gas
 yahi vah jagah hai jahaan sitaron kaa gathan hota he
 The stars formed from it are sometimes referred to as a young, loose cluster
 kuch niharikaon kaa gathan supernova main honevaale visphot arthath vishaal or alp-jivi taron ke ant ke parinamswarup hota he
 The material disintegrated by the explosion of a supernova is ionized by energy and this causes the formation of a solid object to be formed
 vrish taramandal kaa craib nebyal iskaa sravshreshth udhaaharan he
 In the year 1054 a supernova incident was recorded and marked as SN1054
 visphot ke baad nirmit thos vastu craib nebyal ke kendra main sthit he or yah ek neutron star he
 Other nebulae may constitute planetary nebulae
 prithvi ke suraj kii tarah, yah lo-maas arthath dravyaman taare ke jivan kaa antim charan he
 Stars with 8–10 solar masses develop as red demon stars and gradually lose their deafening layer during pulsing in their atmosphere
 jab ek tara paryaapt saamagree kho detaa he, tab iskaa taapmaana badhata he or isse utsarjit parabangnee vikiran iske dwaara aasapaas phenke hue nebyal ko ynit kar saktaa he
 The nebula contains 97% hydrogen and 3% helium, including residual content
 is charan kaa mukhya lakshya santulan praapt karnaa he
 The nebulae are classified into four major groups
 pehle gallexion or gol taragucchon ko bhinn prakaar kii niharikayen samajha jaataa tha
 Spherical nebulae were used to explain the spherical structure of galaxies
 is vargeekaran main badal jaisi sabhi gyaat sanrachanaayen shaamil nahin hai
 One example of which is the herbig-haro object
 sitaron ke paas kii visarit niharikaayen pratibimb niharika kaa udhaaharan hai
 Most nebulae can be called diffuse nebulae, which means they are elaborate and do not fall within the limits of any common definition
 dikhaai dene yogya roshni main in niharikaon ko utsarjan niharika or pratibimb niharikaamein vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, jo is baat par aadhaarit he ki hamen dikhaai denevaale prakaash kii rachana kis tarah hui he
 The emission nebula consists of imported gases, which form a blurred line of emission
 in utsarjan niharikaon ko aksar HII kshetra kaha jaataa he, "HII" shabd kaa upyog vyavsaayik khagol vigyaan main aksar ynit hydrogen ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Compared to emission nebulae, reflection nebulae themselves do not form sufficient visible light lines, but rather reflect the light of their surrounding stars
 andhri yaa gahari niharikaayen visarit niharikaon jaisi hi hai, lekin unhen unke dwaara utsarjit yaa prativimbit prakaash dwaara nahin dekha ja saktaa
 iske bajaae, unhen dur ke taron yaa utsarjan niharikaon ke saamne ke gahare badalon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Although these nebulae appear differently on light waves, they are bright sources of emission on all infrared or infrared waves
 yah utsarjan mukhyatah niharikaon ke bheetar kii dhul se aata he
 Planetary nebulae are nebulae formed from a gas-rich shell emanating from a low-moss asymptomatic massive branch star when it turns into a white dwarf
 ye niharikaayen, dhundhale utsarjan yukt utsarjit niharikaayen hai jo sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon jaisi hoti hai
 Technically, these are HII regions because most will be hydrogen ionized
 haalanki, grahon kii niharikaayen adhik ghani evam sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon kii apeksha adhik thos hoti hai
 Planetary nebulae have been given this name because the first astronomers who studied these objects thought that nebulae resembled the planets or discs of the planets, however, they are not related to planets
 ek proto planetary nebyal ek khagoleey vastu he, jo bhootpurv ananthasparshi vishaal shakha kii sthiti or uske baad ke grahon kii niharika ke charan ke bich ek taare ke twarit taarakeey kramik vikaas kaa alpakaaleen prakaran he

 a supernova occurs when a high-moss star reaches the end of its life
 jab sitare ke mul yaa centre main parmaanu sanlayan band ho jaataa he, tab sitara vighatit ho jaataa he
 The leaking gas either rebounds or becomes so hot that it spreads out from the center and causes an explosion of stars
 gas kaa failaa hua khol, ek vishesh prakaar ke visarit niharika supernova avshesh kii rachana karata he
 Although most of the light and X-ray emission of the supernova residue originates from ionized gas, the bulk of the radio emission is non-thermal emission known as synchrotron emission

 In the morning, Johnsy wants to see Lata that all the leaves have fallen but she is surprised that there is still one leaf left
 jab johansi hairaan hui ki vah ab bhi vahiin tha, to vah hath karti he ki yah aaj giregaa

 If the first term of a parallelogram is a 1 { \ displaystyle a_ {1}} and the common difference is d then the i term of the series is written as follows or vyapak rup main The finite part of the parallel series is called the finite parallel series and is generally called only the parallel series
 parimit samaantar shrenee kaa yoga ko samaantar shrenee kehete hai
 The behavior of the parallel series depends on its universal difference d
