 Before ancient anthropological discoveries were made in America, there was also the possibility that the ancestors of Indians had developed as an independent branch of mankind on this land, but now it can be said with certainty that mankind on the American continents In the development of a branch of the Kumbh, only the preserved remains of lemurs, tarsiers and monkeys of certain castes have been found on this territory
 pracheen maanav jatiyon ke adhyeta parishrampurvak khoj karne par bhi nikatmanav vanar athwa pracheen maanav koi avshesh yahan nahin paa sake hai

 kalantar main saanskrithik vikaas kii jo dishaaen in samoohon ne apanaai ve bahm samskritiyon se prabhavit nahin hui
 These groups developed the new-age culture independently

 The tradition of grammar in Sanskrit is very ancient
 sanskrit bhashaa ko shuddh rup main jaanane ke liye vyakaran shaastra kiya jaataa he
 Due to its specialty, it is considered to be the most important part of the Veda
 vyakaran ke multah paanch prayojan hai - raksha, ooh, aagam, laghu or asandeh
 The following verse about grammar is very famous
 - - For which "vihasya" is of sixth aspect and "vihaya" is of fourth aspect; "aham and katham" can be dualised
 main aise vyakti kii patni kaise ho sakati hoon ? Sanskrit has three words - singular, dual and plural
 sankhya main ek hone par ekvachan kaa, do hone par dwivachan kaa tathaa do se adhik hone par bahuvachan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Doer karm - ko Karan - to, by sampradaan - ke liye Desolation sambandh - kaa, kii, ke, raa, ri, re, naa, ni, ne, Tribunal - in, on, but sambodhan - he, are, In Sanskrit there are three statements - kartavachaya, karmavachaya and bhavavachaya
 sanskrit main lat, lit, lut, lrut, let, lot, land, lin, lung, lruth – ye das lakaar hote hai
 In fact these are ten suffixes that are added to metals
 in dason pratyayon ke prarambh main 'l' he isliye inhen 'lakaar' kehete hai 
 Out of these ten laksa, the beginning of the six laksa is' t 'at the end - littlit lutti etc
 Therefore these are called tilatkaras and the last four lakaras are called nature because they have' '' at the end
 vyakaranshastra main jab dhaatuon se pibati, khaadati aadi rup siddh kiye jate hai tab in tit or saiit shabdon kaa bahut baar prayog kiya jaataa he
 These lacquers are used to describe the action of various periods
 jaise – jab vartmaan kaal kii kriya bataani ho to dhaatu se lat lakaar jod denge, paroksh bhootkaal kii kriya bataani ho to lit lakaar jodenge
 Like Ltkar: - Shyam: Khelati
 lit lakaar jo apane saath na ghatit hokar kisi itihaas kaa vishay ho 
 Such as: Ram: Ravanam Mamar
 lut lakaar jo aaj kaa din chhod kar aage hone vaala ho 
 Such as: - Best school lrut lakaar jo aane vaale kisi bhi samay main hone vaala ho 
 Such as: --- Ram: Id work let lakaar Lotter like: - Bhavan gachhatu
 ; sah kridetu 
 ; Quick manure
 ; kimahan vadani 
 However, whatever has happened, except today
 jaise :- bhavan tasmin dine bhojanmapachat 
 Likar = There are two types of Laksar: - lung lakaar jo kabhi bhi biit chukaa ho 
 Such as: - Ego food
 lruth lakaar jab kisi kriya kii asiddhi ho gai ho 
 Such as: - If you are unconcerned, thirteenth scholar, bhavitum arhishyat
 is baat ko samaran rakhane ke liye ki dhaatu se kab kis lakaar ko jodenge, nimnlikhit shloke samaran kar lijie- Add in the order of pratyahar and add them in chronological order
 phir baad main jodate jaaain jab tak ki dash lakaar puure na ho jaaen 
 Like Litt Litt Lutt Llut Llitz Llut Llr ङ In these the letter is used only in the Veda
 lok ke liye nau lakaar shesh rahe 
 Now there are two distinctions of people in these nine laksa: - Ashiril and Vidhilika
 is prakaar lok main dash ke dash lakaar ho gaye 
 2) Duality 3) karmdharay 4) Multivariate 5) avyayibhav 6) Dual samaas kriya padon main nahin hota
 The first term of the compound is called the 'former verse', the rest is called the 'north post'
 samaas ke todane ko vigrah kehete hai, jaise -- "ramashyamou" yah samaas he or raamah c shyaamah c iskaa vigrah he
 Trick of recitation for recollection of the readers - 'till now Dada' a = Avayavibhava, b = Bahuvrihi, t = Tattpurusak = Karmadharayah, The = Duality, Auraad = Dwigu

 These gymders should be able to work quickly in tight queues, uproot hijulos without damaging the original plant, and clearing the pinnace, and deciding when each plant is ready to be harvested

 These 40 to 70 pound weight pinnas are cut with a special knife, called a coa
 uske baad unke tukade kiye jate hai or dabaakar unka ras nikaala jaataa he or kinvan tankiyon or hauzon main unhen daalaa jaataa he
 Some tequila companies still use the traditional method, in which the pinnace is crushed with a sprig
 is musto ko, sharkara se alcohoul main parivartit hone ke liye, lakdi yaa steneles steel kii tankiyon main kai dinon tak kinvan ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 Each company keeps its yeast absolutely confidential

 Generally, there is a distinct difference in the taste of tequila prepared from lowland and highland agave plants
 ucchbhumi par ugaae gaye agev paudhon main apekshaakrit zyada mithaas hoti he, par saath hi isko ugane kii prakriya ke kaaran, isamen vanaspatik lakshan bhi hote hai
 However, this difference has recently become blurred due to the lack of agave in 1999 / 2000
 tab se, adhikansh nimnabhoomi ke utpaadak, ucchbhumi main zamin kiraye par lene lage hai or takila ke utpaadan ke liye donon kshetron ke agev paudhon par aadhaarit rahane lage hai
 Nevertheless, most agave plants are grown on the west-facing slope, so that they can receive sunlight throughout the day
 ye paudhe lambey, chaude or raseele hote hai
 Agave plants grown on lowland have a more spontaneous taste and are typically smaller
 mul rup se takila kii do qismein hoti hai: mixtos or 100% agev
 mixtos kinvan kii prakriya main 49% anya sharkara kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, jabaki shesh agev sharkara kaa prayog hota he
 Mixtos use both glucose and fructose sugars
 100% agev takila main, asut agev kaa spasht swaad upar rahete hue blanko yaa plata kadava hota he, jabaki raposedo or anejo kaa swaad meetha, gadha or adhik mishrit hota he
 Like other long-term mussels, tequila tastes of wood, while the alcohol's bitterness decreases
 100% agev takila ke saath swaad kaa mukhya bhed he iskaa aadhaar ghatak, jo anaaj se utpaadit madyasaron kii apeksha vanaspatik he
 Tequila is generally bottled in five categories: reposado ko 20,000 litre jitne bade baralon yaa lakdi ke pipon main rakhaa jaataa he, taaki madhur or adhik mishrit swaad taiyaar ho
 Preferred oak comes from the United States, France, and Canada, and while they are usually white oak, some companies prefer to burn wood for a pungent taste, or use barrels that have previously been used as a substitute for other wines, such as Be done for keeping
 kuch reposado ko lakdi ke nae baralon main purana kiya ja saktaa he, taaki isi tarah lakdi kaa swaad or chiknaapan paa sake, lekin kam samay main
 Anejo is often placed in the barrel used to hold the reposado
 ye bairal 600 litre se adhik ke nahin hote, haalanki adhiktar lagbhag 200 litre ke bairal main sangrahit kiye jate hai
 Most commonly used barrels come from whiskey or bourbon brewing factories in the United States, France, or Canada, resulting in a thick and mixed flavor of the Anezo tequila
 chunki zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki 4 saal purana takila sarvshereshth hota he, baralon main hone vaale vashpikaran ko kam karne ke liye, anejo ko lakdi ke baralon se baahar nikaal kar, steneles steel kii tankiyon main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 It is a common misconception that some tequila bottles contain a 'worm'
 saadharantah oksaka rajya ke kuch mezkal ko kabhi con gusaano ke rup main beche gaye the or vahiin se 1940 ke dashak main ek vipanan hatkande ke rup main isaki shuruuaat hui
 In fact, this worm is the fecal form of the Hypopta aegis insect, which inhabits the agave plant
 sansaadhan ke dauraan paudhe main keede kaa milanaa paryakraman kaa suchak he or tadnusaar kam gunvattta ke utpaada ko darshata he
 However, this misconception remains and despite all the efforts and marketing to make tequila as a premium - just as Cognac is viewed compared to brandy, just as it is - there are some promising producers who profit These boundaries are blurred to earn

 In Mexico, tequila is often drunk directly
 kuch kshetron main utkrishth takila ko sangrita ke saath pine kaa prachlan he, joki ek khatta-meetha, masaaledaar madhpan he jise aam taur par santare ke ras, grenadine or tikhi mirch se banaaya jaataa he
 In equal amounts of tequila and sangerita are taken alternately, without salt or lemon
 mexico ke baahar takila kaa ek shot aksar namak or neembu ke ek tukade ke saath parosa jaataa he
 It is called "tequila Cruda" and is sometimes referred to as "training Wheels", "lick-sip-suck", "lick-shoot-suck"
 takila pine vaale apni hatheli kii tarjani ke neeche vaale hisse ko geela karte hai or us par namak chhidakte hai
 Then lick the salt of the hand, then drink the tequila and cut a piece of fruit
 piyakkadon ke samoohon ke liye ek saath aisa karnaa, aam baat he
 Tequila drinking in this way is often erroneously called tequila slammer
 haalanki mexican paaramparik shot sidhaa takila hota he or jab chaser kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, tab pasandida fal neembu hota he
 It is believed that salt reduces the "burning" of tequila and citrus fruits balance and enhance the taste
 germany or kuch anya deshon main takila oro kaa seven aksar pehle dalacheenee or baad main naarangi kii phaankon ke saath kiya jaataa he, jabaki takila blanko kaa seven namak or neembu ke saath kiya jaataa he
 Finally, as with other popular alcohols, a variety of shot-related drinking games and "stunt" drinks occur, such as body shots
 yah dhyaan main rakhaa jaae ki kai ucch gunvattta vaale 100% agev takila main alcohoul kii jalan nahin hoti he or namak or neembu ke saath unke seven se praayah swaad ke dur hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Typically this type of tequila is drank in a sniffer glass rather than shot glass and tastes slower, rather than being swallowed quickly
 jab takila neet pilaai jaati he, to use kaabalito naamak shot gilaas main hi diya jaataa he, lekin aksar sniftor yaa tambler main bhi ise dekha ja saktaa he
 In 2002 the Consejo Regulador del Tequila approved a "government tequila glass" prepared by Riedel, called Overture Tequila Glass
 sampoorn takila / mishrit falon kii peya style main mukhyatah, kinare par namak, chini se lipa yaa sada margrita gilaas hota he, jisamen swayan margrita bhi shaamil he
 Beverages that contain varieties of tequila have an almost endless variety, which depends only on the imagination of the preparers
 adhikansh asut sharaabon ke samaan hi, martini kii ek qism he, jisamen takila ke saath-saath asankhya falon ke ras mila kar banaae gaye takila peya shaamil hote hai, jaise ki takila sunrise or metador

 He adopted a helpless and homeless Rajput mother and her son, seeking asylum
 kaalaantar main meena raja ne us bachche dhola raay ko bada hone par meena rajavaade ke pratinidhi swaroop dilli bheja
 People of Meena dynasty always used to be armed with weapons, so attacking and defeating them was not easy
 kintu varsh main keval ek baar, diwaali ke din ve yahaan bane ek kund main apane shastron ko utaar kar alag rakh dete the evam snaan evam pitru-tarpan kiya karte the
 This thing was kept very secret, but Dholaraya told this to a drummer who spread to other Rajputs
 tab diwaali ke din ghaat lagaakar rajputon ne un nihathe meenaon par akraman kar diya evam us kund ko meenaon kii raktranjit laashon se bhar diya
 In this way he gained suzerainty over the Khong
 rajasthan ke itihaas main kushwaha rajputon ke is kaary ko ati hey drushti se dekha jaataa he va atyadhik kaayartapurna va sharmnaak mana jaataa he

 The present Amer palace was built in the 16th century, which was an extension of the already built palace for the residence of its rulers
 yahaan kaa purana prasaad, jise kadimi mahal kaha jaataa he bharat ke pracheenatam vidyaman mehalon main se ek he
 This ancient palace is built in the valley behind Amer Mahal

 That is why the history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers, because they established their empire here
 meenaon ke samay ke madhyakaal ke bahut se nirmaan yaa to dhwans kar diye gaye yaa unke sthaan par aaj koi anya nirmaan kiya hua he
 However, the 16th century Amer fort and the palace complex which was built by the Rajput Maharajas are well preserved

 Since then, Amer became the capital of the Kachhwahs and remained until the creation of the newly built city of Jaipur

 Prithviraj himself was a follower of Saint Krishnadasa Payahari of the Sri Vaishnava sect of Galata

 The Amer and Jaigad fort are built on a hill of the Aravalli ranges above the mound of eagle
 asal main yah mahal evam jaigarh durg ek hi parisar ke bhaag kahe jate hai evam donon ek pahari surang ke maarg se jude hue hai
 This tunnel was built in secret, which was intended to secretly lead the people of the dynasty to the more secure Jaigad fort in case of adversity during the war

 This gate was facing east and the rays of the rising sun would enter the fort, so it was called Suraj Pol

 Jaleb Chowk is an Arabic word which means place of gathering of soldiers

 Near this is the Vaishnava temple of Shiromani

 To the right of Jalebi Chowk is a small but grand temple dedicated to the Kuldevi Shila Mata of the Kachhwaha Rajputs
 shila devi kaali mata yaa durga maa kaa hi ek avatar hai
 The main entrance of the temple has a pair of silver letter-studded doors
 in par ubhari hui navadurga deviyon va das mahavidhyaon ke chitra bane hue hai
 a statue of the main goddess is installed between two big lions made of silver on both sides of the temple

 raja ne 1604 main vijay milane par us shila ko sagar se nikalwakar amer main devi kii murti ubharavayi tathaa yahaan sthapana karavaayi thi
 Due to this idol being found in Shila form, its name was read as Shila Mata
 mandir ke praveshdwar ke upar ganesh kii muunge kii ekashm murti bhi sthapit he
 According to another legend, after the king of Jessore was defeated by Raja Man Singh, this Shyam shila was presented which is related to Mahabharata
 mahabharat main krishna ke mamaa mathura ke raja kansa ne krishna ke pehle 7 bhai bahanon ko isi shila par maaraa tha
 In lieu of this rock, Raja Man Singh returned the territory of Jessore to the defeated King of Bengal
 tab is shila par durga ke mahisasuramardini rup ko uker kar amer ke is mandir main sthapit kiya tha
 Since then, Shila Devi was worshiped as the ancient goddess in the Kachhwaha Rajputs of Amer, although Jamwa Mata of Ramgarh, already being worshiped as Kuldevi in her family, remained Kuldevi

 Every citizen of the country needs to come forward against the atrocities on girls
 balikaon ke shashaktikaran main har prakaar kaa sahyog dene kii jarurat he
 This work should start from home
 ne upar hone vaale atyaachaar ko bhi ve parivaar ke liye hans kar sahan karti hai
 It is indeed ironic that in our country's most prosperous states, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Gujarat, the sex ratio is the lowest, the most inhuman and disgusting act of female feticide
 pitru sattatmak maansikta or balka ko variyata diya janaa aisi moolyaheenata he, jise kuch chikitsak ling nirdhaaran pareekshan jaisi seva dekar badhaava de rahe hai
 It is a matter of concern that the trend of female feticide is being found more in some of the rich states of the country
 desh kii janaganana-2001 ke anusaar ek hajaar balka main balikaon kii sankhya punjab main 798, haryana main 819 or gujarat main 883 he, jo ek chintaa kaa vishay he
 It needs to be taken seriously
 kuch anya raj ne apane yahaan is ghrunit pravriti ko gambhirtha se liya or ise rokane ke liye anek prabhavakaari kadam uthaae jaise gujarat main 'deekri bachaao abhiyaan' chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Similarly, schemes are also being run in other states
 yah kaary keval sarkaar nahin kar sakati he
 Active participation of the society is very important to make the girl child save campaign
 desh main pichley chaar dashaka se saat saal se kam aayu ke bacchon ke ling anupaat main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he
 In 1981, there were 962 girls behind one thousand girls
 varsh 2001 main yah anupaat ghatakar 927 ho gaya, jo ek chintaa kaa vishay he
 This is an indication that our economic prosperity and increasing level of education are not having any effect on this problem
