 jaise mashhoor suez or panama kii naharen
 nahar shabd multah farsi shabd he
 In the cities of netherlands, the city's canals are also called gracht
 sinchai kii naharon ke nirmaan main vishesh baat yah hoti he ki ye naharen aise pathon se le jaai jaati hai jahaan sambhavat: naharon ke donon kinaaron kii ore pani sinchai ke liye nikalakar bah sake
 Hence the flow of the canal is planned through irrigated area on the highest land
 nadi or naale iske vipareet, kshetra ke neeche se neeche hisse main hokar behate hai
 In fact, canals often originate on high ground between two rivers or streams
 kahin-kahin is ucch bhoomi tak pahunchne main naharon ko kai nadiyaan or naale paar karne padate hai
 For example, the Upper Ganga Canal has to cross four mountainous rivers, about 20 miles between Haridwar and Roorkee, at its origin, and that too in varying degrees
 vastav main rudki se haridwar tak upree ganga nahar ke saath pakki sadak jaati he or in 20 milon main ejineering ke kuch mahatvapurn kaaryon ko dekhne kaa avasar miltaa he
 At two places, the canal crosses the mountainous rivers at one place, the river is merged with the canal and at another place, over the Solani aqueduct, the canal passes over the river
 solani aquidct vishwavikhyath he
 This important work, with only bricks and lime, was completed in about 1850 AD
 sinchai kii nahar jaise-jaise aage badhati he, vah ped kii shaakhon kii tarah choti hoti jaati he
 On the contrary, as the rivers move, they become larger and their tributaries and streams continue to meet in them
 shakhaon se vitaran nahar athwa rajbahe nikalate hai or inamen choti naharen, jinhen miner yaa bambe kehete hai, nikalati hai
 From all these canals, water is extracted for fields by kulabe, maudhe or out late
 yah sab vitaran vaigyanik rup se nidhurit siddhoton ke anukool hota he
 If this is not done, the water cannot reach the canals, which carry water for hundreds of miles
 iske liye sarkari vibhaag sthapit he jinamein kushal ejeeniyar log naharon ko acchhee haalat main rakhane or unamem nirdhaarit maatra main pani chalaane ke liye niyukt hote hai
 Water in the canals is also run at such a speed that there is no erosion nor sediment in the canal
 jahaan bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he, prapaat bana die jate hai, taaki nahar kii tali kii dhaal nirdhaarit dasha main rakhi ja sake
 a lot of research work in this direction has been and continues to happen in India
 or bhi bahut si samasyaayen naharon ke sanchaalan main saamne aati rahati hai, jinka samaadhaan karne kaa uttardaayitv ejiniyaron ke upar rahata he
 Evacuations are also made in the canals as per the requirement, by which the additional water can be drained into the adjacent river or drains when not required or during any breakage
 aisa bahudhaa hota he ki nahar puri chal rahi he or us kshetra main baari varsha ho gai jisase paan kii maang shunya ho gai
 In such a situation Moghe or Kulabe have to be closed
 parantu sampurna pani ko nahar saadh nahin sakati, at: pani ko nikaas dwaara nadi yaa naalon main nikaalnaa anivaary ho jaataa he
 Where the canal is made through more filler, the two sides of the canal are made with great care
 udhaaharan ke liye, upree ganga nahar rudki ke sameep solani aquidct ke donon ore baari bharaav main hokar guzarati he
 There the filler is up to 35 feet, ie the land on both sides is quite low
 yahan pakke pushte banaae gaye hai, jo lagbhag teen mile kii lambaai main hai
 But still the water leakage takes place from the bottom of which there are drains on both the sides to contain it, in which the leakage water accumulates and goes into the river
 naharon se kahin-kahin rison dwaara haani bhi bahut hoti he
 Due to the formation of canals, the normal ground water level becomes high
 yadi aas-paas kii bhoomi main pani ke rison kii kshamta kam hui to jalrodh kii avasthaa ho jaati he or krishiyogy bhoomi krishi ke aayogy hone lagati he
 Therefore, along with the construction of canals, the construction of drainage channels becomes necessary
 yadi ye upaay yathasamay nahin kar liye jate to baari haani hone kii ashanka rahati he, jaisaa punjab ke kuch kshetron main ho gaya he
 Construction of canals as well as canals is mandatory
 sansar ke bahut se kshetron main pani ke upyukt nikaas na hone ke kaaran naharon se laabh ke bajaae haani hui he
 Somewhere, to prevent leakage, the bottom of the canals and the two coastal sides are concrete or chosen or fixed by other means
 iske dwaara pani kaa risna kam ha jaataa he
 This policy is particularly successful in the area where there is no irrigation and the canal is built only to carry water forward
 kintu jahaan sinchai hoti he vahaan is saadhan ke dwaara adhik dinon tak jalrodh se bachaav nahin ho paata, vahaan saavdhaneepurvak bhusinchan tathaa yathanukool nikasi naalon athwa bhoomi ke neeche atirikt jalanikasi yuktiyon se kaam lenaa anivaary ho jaataa he

 yah sthiti hindi or urdu bhashaa donon main samaan rup se dikhaayi detii he
 Premchand's novels are milestones not only in Hindi novel literature but also in Indian literature
 premachand katha-sahitya main unke upanyaaskaar kaa armbh pehle hota he
 His first Urdu novel Asrar Maabid aka Devasthan Rajya was published in serial form in Urdu weekly "awaaz-e-khalk" from 8 October 1903 to 1 February 1905
 unka doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 Since Premchand was originally the author of Urdu and came from Urdu into Hindi, all his early novels were originally written in Urdu and later he was written in Hindi
 unhone 'sevasadan' upanyaas se hindi upanyaas kii duniya main pravesh kiya
 He originally wrote it in Urdu under the name 'bajare-hussan' but first published its Hindi form 'sevasadan'
 'sevasadan' ek nari ke veshya banane kii kahani he

 Premchand had started a revolutionary change in Hindi fiction by making Surdas, a blind beggar, a hero of fiction in Rangbhoomi
 godaan kaa hindi sahitya hi nahin, vishwa sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan he
 In it, Premchand's literary ideology achieves perfection from 'idealistic realism' to 'critical realism'
 ek saamaanya kisaan ko puure upanyaas kaa nayak bananaa bhartiya upanyaas parampara kii disha badal dene jaisaa tha
 The death of Hori, a storyline trapped in the cycle of feudalism and capitalism, shakes the minds of readers
 kisaan jivan par apane pichley upanyaason 'premashram' or 'karmbhumi' main premanchad yatharth kii prastuti karte-karte upanyaas ke ant tak adarsh kaa daaman tham lete hai
 But Godan's tactful ending is a witness to the fact that Premchand was disillusioned with idealism by then
 yah unki aakhri daur kii kahaniyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Mangalasutra is an unfinished novel of Premchand
 premchand ke upanyaason kaa mul kathy bhartiya gramin jivan tha
 The height that Premchand gave to the Hindi novel remained a challenge for the successors of the latter

 premchand ji kii lokapriy kahaniyaan Premchand composed the plays 'sangram', 'karbala' and 'prem ki Vedi'
 ye naatak shilp or samvednaa ke str par achche hai lekin unki kahaniyon or upanyaason ne itani oonchaai praapt kar lee thi ki naatak ke kshetra main premchand ko koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 These plays have become really interactive novels
 premchand ek samvedansheel kathakaar hi nahin, sajag naagarik va sampadak bhi the
 He edited his literary and social concerns through articles or essays in 'hans', 'madhuri', 'jagran' etc
, while editing magazines and magazines in the then other co-existing literary magazines 'chand', 'maryada', 'swadesh' etc
 Expressed from amritraay dwaara sampadit 'premchand : vividh prasang' vastav main premchand ke lekhon kaa hi sankalan he

 unke dwaara ratannath sarshar ke urdu upanyaas 'fasaan-e-aaazaad' kaa hindi anuwaad 'aaazaad katha' bahut mashhoor hua
 Premchand came to Hindi with the rite of Urdu and became a great Hindi writer
 hindi ko apana khaas muhaavara or khulaapan diya
 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian
 unki rachanaaon main ve nayak hue, jise bhartiya samaaj achhut or ghrunit samajha tha
 He used the language of simple, easy and common language and presented his progressive ideas strongly to the society
 1936 main pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan kii adhyakshata karte hue unhone kaha ki lekhak swabhaav se pragatisheel hota he or jo aisa nahin he vah lekhak nahin he
 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, the Munshi ornamentation of Premchand has become so rigid that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made, and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye
 In the era in which Premchand raised the pen, there was no solid legacy behind him nor was there any model of thought and progress, except in Bengali literature
 us samay bankim babu the, sharathchandra the or iske alaava tollstoy jaise rusi sahityakar the
 But by the time he composed a classic novel like Godan which is considered a modern classic
 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
 When the freedom movement of India was going on, the expression he gave to both Hindi and Urdu languages through narrative literature gave rise to political stirring, passion and movement to all and made him powerful and this also made his writing powerful
 premchand is arth main nishchit rup se hindi ke pehle pragatisheel lekhak kahe ja sakate hai
 In 1936, he addressed the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Association as the Chairman
 unka yahi bhaashan pragatisheel andolan ke ghoshnaa patr kaa aadhaar bana
 Premchand gave birth to a tradition of storytelling in Hindi and an entire generation followed in his footsteps, Renu, Nagarjuna and after him Srinath Singh has written stories of rural environment in the 50-60s, in a way that tradition of Premchand Comes in line with premchand ek krantikari rachanaakaar the, unhone na keval deshbhakti balki samaaj main vyaapt anek kuritiyon ko dekha or unako kahani ke madhyam se pehali baar logon ke samaksh rakhaa
 He began to portray all the problems of society at that time
 usamen dalit bhi aate hai, nari bhi aati hai
 All these subjects later became major discourses of Hindi literature
 premchand hindi cinema ke sabase adhik lokapriy sahityakaron main se hai
 Satyajit Rai made memorable films on two of his stories
 1977 main shatranj ke khilaadi or 1981 main sadgati
 Two years after his death, Subramaniam made the film in 1938 on the novel Sevasadan in which Subbalakshmi played the lead role
 1977 main mrinal sen ne premchand kii kahani kafan par aadhaarit oka uri katha naam se ek telugu film banaai jisko sarvshereshth telugu film kaa rashtriya puraskaar bhi mila
 Godan in 1963 and embezzlement in 1966 became popular films
 1980 main unke upanyaas par bana tivi dharawahik nirmala bhi bahut lokapriy hua tha

 The brain covering consists of three membranes, which together with the brain spinal cord, surround and protect the brain and spinal cord
 mridu tanika ek bahut najuk abhedya jhilli hoti he jo sabhi chote conturs ke saath mastishk kii sataha par dridhtaa ke saath lagi hoti he
 The arcnoid mater is a loose-fitting sac then the soft basin is on top
 sakirkanoed spes, arkanoed or paaya meter jhilli ko pruthak karti he or mastishk meru dravya se bhari hoti he
 The outermost membrane is the dura mater, a thick durable membrane that connects both the arachnoid membrane and the skull
 bacteria janit mastishk fever main, bacteria do mukhya margon se mastishk aavaran tak pahunchataa he: rakt pravaah dwaara yaa mastishk aavaran ke saath nesal cavity yaa twachaa ke sidhe sampark dwaara
 In most cases, meningitis attacks the mucous surfaces such as the nasal cavity through the bloodstream through living organisms
 yah aksar virus dwaara hone vaale sankramanon ke baad hota he jo shleshm sataha dwaara pradaan kiye jane vaali baadha ko tod detaa he
 Once bacteria are involved in the bloodstream, the subarachnoid enters the space in places where the blood – brain barrier is weak — such as the choroid plexus
 mastishk fever 25% navjaaton main group bi steptocoki ke kaaran rakt pravaah sankramanon se hota he; yah rup vayaskon main kam aam he
 Direct contamination of the cerebrospinal fluid can arise from indwelling devices, skull fractures or infection of the nasopharynx or from the nasal sinus that forms the passage along the subarachnoid space; Occasionally, congenital defects of the dura mater can also be seen
 mastishk fever ke dauraan bade str par sakirkanoed spes main hone vaali sujan bacteria sankraman kaa pratyaksh parinaam nahin hota he balki ise bacteria ke kendriya tantrika tantra main pravesh ke kaaran pratiraksha tantra kii pratikriya kaa parinaam hota he
 When the components of bacterial infected cell membranes are identified by the immune cells of the brain, they react by releasing large amounts of hormone-like cytokine that employ other immune cells and provoke other tissues to participate in the immune response
 
 rakt-mastishk baadha pargamya ho jaati he, jiske kaaran "vaisogenic" cerebraille edima ho jaataa he
 Large amounts of white blood cells enter the CSF, causing inflammation of the brain lining and causing "interstitial" edema
 iske atirikt, rakt keshikaon kii deevaaren apane aap sooj jaati he, jisase rakt kaa pravaah kam ho jaataa he or ek tisare tarah kaa edima "cytotoxic" edima ho jaataa he
 All three types of cerebral edema cause increased intracranial pressure; With which, severe infection also suffers from decreased blood pressure, which means that it becomes difficult for the blood to enter the brain, as a result of which the brain cells lack oxygen and enter the apatosis stage
 manyata yah he ki antibiotics upar bataayi gayi prakriya ko, bacteria sambandhit koshika jhilli utpaadon kii maatra ko badha kar, shuruyaat main or kharaab kar saktaa he
 Specific treatments such as the use of corticosteroids are targeted at discouraging the immune system's response to this type of event
 mastishk fever se peedit kisi vyakti main, rakt pareekshan un chihnon kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye jate hai jo vruddhi or rakt cultureki jaankaree dete hai
 The most important test to identify meningitis is the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture
 halanki lumber panchar tab pratidisht ho jaataa he jab mastishk main koi pind upasthit ho yaa antahkapaly dabaav badha hua ho kyonki iske kaaran mastishk herniation hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 If a person has a nodal or enlarged ICP, a CT or MRI scan is recommended before a lumbar puncture
 yah sabhi vayask maamalon ke 45% maamalon par lagu hota he
 If a CT or MRI is required before LP or if LP proves difficult, professional guidelines suggest antibiotics should be given to delay treatment, especially if it is more than 30 minutes
 aksar CT yaa MRI scan, baad kii avasthaa main kiye jate hai jisase ki mastishk fever kii jatiltaaon kaa aankalan kiya ja sake
 Blood electrolytes may be important in severe forms of meningitis; for example hypnotemia is a common bacterial meningitis due to a combination of several factors including dehydration, improper excretion of antidiuretic hormone, or additional active intravenous fluid administration
 aam taur par ek vyakti ko ek karavat main lita kar, cerebral taral ekatra karne ke liye local anaesthesia laga kar or dural sac main ek sui daal kar lumber panchar kiya jaataa he
 When this is achieved, csf's "opening pressure" is measured using a manometer
 daab aam taur par 6 or 18 cm jal ke bich hota he; bacteria janit mastishk fever main daab aam taur par badha hota he
 In cryptococcal meningitis, there is a significant increase in intracranial pressure
 taral kaa aarambhik swaroop sankraman kii prakruti kaa sanket sabit ho saktaa he: dhundhala CSF sanket karata he ki protein, safed va laal rakt koshikaon or / yaa bacteria kaa str ooncha he or isaliye isamen bacteria janit mastishk fever ho saktaa he
 CSF samples are tested for the presence and type of white blood cells, red blood cells, protein content and glucose levels
 namoonay kii gram staning bacteria janit mastishk fever main bacteria pradarshit kar saktaa he, lekin bacteria kii anupasthiti bacteria janit mastishk fever kii sambhaavna ko nishkasit nahin karti he kyonki ve sirf 60% maamalon main dikhte hai; yadi namoona liye jane ke pehle antibiotics diye gayi the to yah aankada 20% tak or kam ho jaataa he
 Gram staining is also less reliable in infections such as listeriosis
 microbiological culture kaa namoona adhik samvedansheel hota he lekin parinaam uplabdh hone main 48 ghante tak kaa samay lagata he
 The more present type of blood cells indicate whether meningitis is bacterial or virus-induced, although it is not always a reliable indicator at the onset of the disease
 kam saamaanya maamalon main snophil prabalata duusare kaarnon ke saath paraseete yaa funfoond ke kaaran hone kaa suzav detii he
 Excess of glucose in CSF is generally 40% higher than in blood
 bacteria janit mastishk fever main yah aam taur par kam hoti he; CSF kaa glucose str is kaaran rakt sharkara se vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 a ratio of ≤0
4 may indicate bacterial meningitis; Glucose levels in CSF in neonates are generally high and a ratio below 0
6 is considered abnormal
 CSF main lactate bacteria janit mastishk fever ke hone kii sambhaavna ke ucch str ko darshata he, thik aise hi shwet rakt koshikaon kii ucch sankhya bhi
 If the lactate levels are less than 35 mg / dl and the person has not taken any antibiotics before, this reduces the likelihood of bacterial meningitis
 mastishk jwaron ke vibhinn prakaar kii pruthak pahchaan karne ke liye anya vishesh pareekshan upyog kiye ja sakate hai
 The latex agglutination test may be positive in meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilis influenzae, Escherichia coli and Group b streptococci; Regular use of this is not encouraged because it causes very little change in treatment but can be used when other tests are unable to diagnose
 isi prakaar limulus liset pareekshan gram-nakaaratmak bacteria janit mastishk fever main sakaaratmak ho saktaa he, lekin yah tab tak simit rup se upyogi hota he jab tak ki anya pareekshan sahaayak na rahe ho
 Polymerase chain reaction is a technique used to amplify small traces of bacterial DNA to identify the presence of bacterial or virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid; It is a high-sensitivity and specific test because it requires the amount of DNA traces of the infecting agent
 yah bacteria janit mastishk fever main bacteria kii pahchaan kar saktaa he or virus janit mastishk fever ke vibhinn maamalon main antar pataa karne ke liye sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Serology may be useful in viral meningitis
 yadi tubarkalos mastishk fever kaa andeh ho to, namoonay ko zeel nelson stenjiski samvedansheeltaa nimna he or tuberculosis culture, jisamen adhik samay lagata he; PCR kaa upyog bad rahaa he
 Cryptococcal meningitis can be diagnosed at low cost using the Indian Ink stain on CSF; However, testing for cryptococcal antigens in blood or CSF is more sensitive, especially in people with AIDS
 jahaan par antibiotics lene ke baad mastishk fever ke lakshan hote hai, "aanshik rup se upachaarit mastishk fever", ek nidanatmak va upachaaratmak kathinaayee he
 When this happens, CSF findings may resemble those of viral meningitis, but antibiotic treatment needs to be continued as long as definite symptoms of the virus cause
 mastishk fever kaa nidaan mrityu ke baad ho saktaa he
 Post-mortem findings typically indicate an increased inflammation of the arachnoid, the layers of the mater and the brain covering
 neutrophil granulokite, craniel nerve or ridh ke saath cerebrospinal taral or mastishk ke aadhaar kii ore bad jate hai, jo ki pas dwaara ghire ho sakate hai — isi prakaar maningiel keshikaayen bhi
 For some causes of meningitis, protection may be provided through long-term vaccination or in the short term by antibiotics
 kuch vyavhaar janit upaay bhi prabhavi ho sakate hai
 Bacterial and virus-induced meningitis is contagious, although neither is as contagious as common colds or flu
 chumban, chhikane yaa kisi ke khansane se hone vaale shwasan srav se nikali buundon ke madhyam se dono rogon kaa sankraman ho saktaa he lekin mastishk fever se peedit vyakti dwaara chodi gayi hawa ke madhyam se aisa nahin ho saktaa he
 Virus-induced meningitis is usually caused by enterovirus and is most commonly spread by fecal contamination
 sankraman kaa jokhim us vyavhaar main badlaav laakar kam kiya ja saktaa he jiske kaaran sankraman hua
 Since 1980, many countries have included vaccination against Homophelus influenzae type b in their regular childhood vaccination plans
 isane, in deshon ke yuva bacchon main is pathojan ko mastishk fever ke kaaran rup main lagbhag samaapt kar diya he
 In countries where the disease burden is highest, the vaccine is still very expensive
 isi prakaar, mums ke viruddh tikaakaran ne mums sambandhi mastishk fever ke maamalon ko kaaphi kam kar diya he, jo tikaakaran ke pehle, mums ke 15% maamalon main hua karte the
 Meningococcus vaccine is available against groups A, C, W135 and Y
 ve desh jahaan par samooh si mastishk fever ke liye tike shuru kiye gayi the, is pathojan se hone vaale maamalon main paryaapt kami aayi he
 An all-round vaccine now exists that combines all four vaccines
 ACW135Y tike ke saath tikaakaran haj main bhaag lene ke liye jaruri he
 The formulation of the vaccine against group b meningococci has proven to be quite difficult, as its surface protein response to the immune system or cross-reaction to normal human protein is weak
 phir bhi kuch deshon, ne group bi maningokoki ke sthaneey upabhedon ke viruddh tike viksit kiye hai; kuch ne achche parinaam diye hai or unako sthaneey tikaakaran suchi main upyog kiya ja rahaa he

 Resource management at Company of Heroes provides management details on all sides, such as military empowerment, which has an impact in generating a more intelligent RTS experience
 khilaadiyon kaa nakshe ke kuch binduon par niyantran lenaa anivaary hota he
 The more points a player controls, the more resources they gain
 yah avadharana ek khilaadi ke kshetra ke nirantar vistaar kii maang karti he
 These points are connected to the supply lines etc
 and therefore during the fight a player can isolate the rest and occupy one point of the supply line, which is connected to the base through it and thus reduces the enemy's resources Huh
 khilaadi teen sansadhano kaa sangrah karte hai: maanavshakti, hathiyaar or eendhan
 sabhi ikaayiyon ke nirmaan ke liye maanavshakti aavashyak he
 Weapons allow the player to upgrade individual squads or vehicles and use special abilities

 In addition, infantry units can only fire through windows or holes made in the building when inside the front
 kuch hathiyaar imaarat main chhipe ikaayiyon ke khilaaf behad prabhavi hote hai, jaise jhole main rakhe hathiyaar yaa paidal sena ke paas sthit rocket lanchar ek imaarat ko dhwast kar sakate hai, tanks se gole dagkar imaarat main visphot kiya ja saktaa hai or aag phenkanevaale shastron se sajjit paidal sena yaa tinkon ke jariye imaarat ko aag laga sakate hai or usamen chhipe sabhi logon ko jala sakate hai
 However, it also has benefits; The infantry are well protected from small arms and most of the buildings are so strong that they can stand for long periods of time before falling to the tank
 In addition, the Company of Heroes, which is mildly involved with the theme of buildings collapsing, is one of the first games based on World War II strategy to introduce dynamic building destruction, which exploited the physics engine used for the game
 For example, if a tank concentrates its shelling at one place near the floor of a building, then the entire building will first collapse in that specific area and later the rest of the building will collapse
 kabja kiye hue bhawanon ko dushman kii ikaayiyon kii firing yaa kisi anya ke hamale ke baad top ke golon yaa dhvansaatmak hamale se nasht kiya ja saktaa he

 ek motor pool yaa tanks depo banane se pehle ek aapurti yard banane kii bhi jarurat hogi jisase paidal sena or tinkon kii laagat kam karne hetu unhen unnatsheel banaaya ja sake
 Germans can build a wide variety of structures

 Craig barracks and strum arsenals may constitute light vehicles and other infantry, while strum arsenals and armored command may deploy German tanks according to the player's management

 US infantry units are higher than their Wehrmacht counterparts, but are generally less effective in a direct battle and rely on upgrades and abilities to gain an edge in battle
 jab unke paas aprashikshit sainikon kii kami ho tab america vaahan or tanks tej gati se chalate hai or sahyog ke vibhinn kaaryon jaise barudi surangon ko hataane yaa dhune kaa vaataavaran banane main sakasham hote hai
 theory: german beharmatch ikaayiyon ke pratinidhitiv vaala yah gut americanyon kii tulana main ek vyapak daayre kii ikaayiyon kii niyukti karata he
 Behrmacht units are generally more expensive and powerful, but are more rigid and poorly equipped for their target roles
 beharmatch ke mutabik dakshata arjeet nahin kii jaati balki unke kaincecraft centre main "kharidi" jaati he
 The Behrmacht infantry ranges from simple Volksgrandier Militia to cross holders of elite knights
