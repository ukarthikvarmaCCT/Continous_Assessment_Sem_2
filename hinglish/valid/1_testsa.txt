 mcdonald Calculating the rate of instantaneous change of a variable amount with respect to another variable amount is called differential and the rate obtained by this action is called differential
 yah kisi falan ko kisi char raashi ke saath badhane kii dar ko maapta he
 For example, if a function y is dependent on a variable amount x and the value of x from x1 to x2 becomes the value of y from y1 to y2, then / is called derivative of y with respect to x
 ise dy / dx se nirupit kiya jaataa he
 Keep in mind that change should be subtle to subtle
 isiliye seemaa kaa avkalan main bahut mahatvapurn sthaan he
 To know the slope of a curve at a point, one has to calculate the derivative at that point
 falan ƒ kaa bindu a par avkalaj nimnlikhit seemaa ke baraabar hota he - If there exists a boundary, then ƒ is called non-differential at point a
 d / dx ) = koj d / dx) = - sine samakalan or avkalan ek duusare ke vyutkram kriyaayen hai

06 budhaari bujurg atarauli, aligarh, uttar pradesh sthit ek gaanv he
 One of the conspiracies of the Vaiseshika Hindus is philosophy
 iske mul pravartak rishi kanad hai 
 This philosophy is very similar to justice philosophy, but in reality it is an independent physicist philosophy
 is prakaar ke aatmadarshan ke vichaaron kaa sabase pehle maharishi kanad ne sutara rup main likhaa
 Kanad was a sage
 ye "uchhavriti" the or dhaany ke kanon kaa sangrah kar usee ko khaakar tapasya karte the
 That is why they were called "kanad" or "kanabhuk"
 kisi kaa kahana he ki kan arthath parmaanu tatv kaa sookshm vichaar inhone kiya he, isliye inhen "kanad" kehete hai
 Some people believe that they used to live in samadhi throughout the day and collect particles in the night
 yah vritti "ullu" pakshi kii he
 Who says that pleased with their penance, God preached the scriptures to them as a bird
 inhen kaarnon se yah darshan "aulukya", "kanad", "vaisheshik" yaa "pashupat" darshan ke naamon se prasiddh he
 Due to the lack of special practice in reading and reading, there are many lessons in Vaishika Sutras and 'errors' are also sufficient
 mimasaasutron kii tarah iske kuch sutron main punaruktiyaan hai - jaise "saamaanyavisheshabhavech" "saamanyatodrushtaachcha vishesh:", "tatvan bhaven", "dravyatvanityatve vayuna vyakhyate", "sandigdhstupachaar:" 
 There are two reasons for its naming - prayek nity dravya ko paraspar pruthak karne ke liye tathaa prayek tatv ke vaastavik swaroop ko pruthak-pruthak jaanane ke liye inhone ek "vishesh" naam kaa padaarth mana he ; "duality", "pakjotpatti" and "department of Departments" These three things have their own special view in which they are strong
 abhipraay yah he ki vaisheshik darshan vyaavhaarik tatwon kaa vichaar karne main sanlagn rahane par bhi sthool drushti se sarvatha vyavahaarat: samaan rahane par bhi, prayek vastu duusare se bhinn he
 They have emphasized the only special substance "special", so this section of ancient Indian philosophy is called "vaisesika" philosophy
 anya shastron ne is baat kaa vivechan nahin kiya he
 But for some of the above reasons, this philosophy has been termed as "vaishika Darshan"
 vaisheshik tathaa nyaay donon darshan hi "samantantr" hai
 The practical world is considered real
 ye bahya jagat tathaa antarjagat kii avadharana main paratpar evam ghanishtha sambandh maanate hai
 The external world is not dependent on thought, it is independent
 'aatmadarshan' ke liye vishwa kii sabhi choti-badi, tathvik tathaa tuchh vastuon kaa gyaan praapt karnaa saamaan rup se aavashyak he
 Knowledge of these elements requires evidence
 nyaayashastra main pramaan par vishesh vichaar kiya gaya he, kintu vaisheshik darshan main mukhya rup se 'prameya' ke vichaar par bal diya gaya he
 It is necessary to remember here that Vaishika, like justice, philosophically considers the 'real' elements of the world from a cosmic point of view
 loukik jagat kii vaastavik paristhitiyon kii upeksha vah kabhi nahin karata, tathaapi jahaan kisi tatv kaa vichaar bina sookshm drushti kaa ho nahin saktaa, vahaan kisi prakaar atindriya, adrusht, sookshm, yogaj aadi hetuon ke aadhaar par apane siddhant ko sthapit karnaa is dhara ke darshanikon kaa swabhaav he, anyathaa unki vaicharik bhitiyaan antarvirohi hotin ; faltah parmaanu, akaash, kaal, dik, aatma, man aadi sattaaon kaa sweekaar is darshan main baraabar upasthit he
 The nature, dress and ethos of Vaishyasikas are like 'nayayakis'; As such, these people are Shaiva, they were given Shaiva initiation
 inke chaar pramukh bhed hai - shaiva, pashupat, mahavrathdhar, tathaa kalmukh evam bharat, bhaktar, aadi gaun bhed bhi milte hai
 The Vaiseshiks are specifically called "pashupat"
 
 In Vaisesika opinion, the whole world is divided into these two divisions
 inamen "bhav" ke chah vibhaag kiye gaye hai- jinke naam hai - dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh, tathaa samavaay
 There are also four sub-distinctions of absence - Pragbhava, Prabandhbhava, Extreme feeling and Interaction
 granthon main inke lakshan aadi kuch is tarah praapt hote hai : In matter, the "matter is caste" is the substance
 kaary ke samavayikaran ko dravya kehete hai
 Matter is a shelter of virtues
 prithvi, jal, tejas, vaayu, akaash, kaal, dik, aatma tathaa manas ye nau "dravya" kehalaate hai
 Of these, the first four liquids have two distinctions, Nitya and Anitya
 nityarup ko "parmaanu" tathaa anitya rup ko kaary kehete hai
 That part of the four ghosts is called "atom" which cannot be reparted, hence it is continual
 prithviparmanu ke atirikt anya parmaanuon ke gun bhi nity he
 The "earth" that smells, the "water" that has a cold touch, the "water" that has a warm touch, the "tejas", which does not have form and is not an accidental and imperfect touch of fire, that "air", And the word which has its merit, ie the word which is the samobhavana, is "sky"
 ye hi 'panchabhoot' bhi kehalaate hai
 These four "vibhu" matter are sky, space, space and soul
 manas abhautik parmaanu he or nity bhi he
 Today, tomorrow, this time, that time, month, year, etc
 is the simple reason for the behavior of time - that is time
 kaal nity or vyapak he
 The peculiar cause of the directions, directions, east, west, north, south, etc
, is "trouble"
 yah bhi nity tathaa vyapak he
 The form of soul and mind is the same as that of justice here
 gunakarya kaa asamavayikaran "gun" he
 Rupa, rasa, smell, touch, number, magnitude, separation, coincidence, divisions, divinity, immaturity, gravity, fluidity, affection, words, knowledge, pleasure, sorrow, desire, malice, effort, religion, unrighteousness and samskara
 There are differences of merit
 inamen se rup, gandh, ras, sparsh, sneh, swaabhaavik dravatv, shabd tathaa gyaan se lekar sanskaar paryant, ye "vaisheshik gun" hai, avshisht saadhaaran gun hai
 The qualities remain in matter
 karmkriya ko "karm" kehete hai
 Throwing up, throwing down, shrinking, spreading and moving, such as travel, pulsing, catharsis, etc
, are the differences of the five "karma"
 karm dravya hi main rahata he
 In general, because of the same intelligence that is present in many objects, the "this is this" in each component is the same type of intelligence, the reason is the "normal" in it, which is called "fast" in front of the object's name
 Goes, such as - components, patency
 "tv" se us jati ke antargat sabhi vyaktiyon kaa gyaan hota he
 It is regular and lives in matter, quality and action
 adhik sthaan main rahanevaala "saamaanya", "parasaamaanya" yaa "sattasamanya" yaa "par satta" kaha jaataa he
 The common substance, quality and deeds reside in all three
 prayek vastu main rahanevaala tathaa avyapak jo saamaanya ho, vah "apper saamaanya" yaa "saamaanya vishesh" kaha jaataa he
 Separating one object from another means normal
 visheshadravyon ke antim vibhaag main rahanevaala tathaa nity dravyon main rahanevaala "vishesh" kehalaata he
 This is the only substance that distinguishes between continents
 yah anant he
 There is a kind of relationship, which ties between the ingredients and the ingredients, the virtues and the virtues, the verb and the functional caste and the person and the special and continual matter
 vah ek he or nity bhi he
 The absence of something is called "absence" of that object
 iske chaar bhed hai - "prag abhaav" kaary utpann hon ke pehle kaaran main us kary kaa na rahanaa, "pradhwans abhaav" kaary ke naash hone par us kaary kaa na rahanaa, "atyant abhaav" teenon kaalon main jiskaa sarvatha abhaav ho, jaise vandhya kaa putr tathaa "anyonya abhaav" paraspar abhaav, jaise ghat main pat kaa na hona tathaa pat main ghat kaa na hona
 All these substances are under theorems of jurisprudence
 isliye nyaayadarshan main inkaa pruthak vichaar nahin he, kintu vaisheshik darshan main to mukhya rup se inkaa vichaar he
 According to the Vaisesika doctrine, attaining real knowledge of these seven substances gives freedom
 in donon samaan tatwon main padaarthon ke swaroop main itnaa bhed rahane par bhi donon darshan ek hi main mili rahete hai, iskaa kaaran he ki donon shastron kaa mukhya prameya he "aatma"
 The nature of the soul is the same in both philosophies
 anya vishay he - usee aatma ke jaanane ke liye upaay
 There is not much difference between these two philosophies
 keval shabdon main tathaa kahin-kahin prakriya main bhed he
 There is no difference in fruit
 atev nyaayamat ke anusaar pramaan, prameya aadi solah padaarthon ke tatvagyan se donon se ek hi prakaar kii "mukti" milti he
 Both have the same point of view
 nyaay vaisheshik mat main prithvi, jal, tejas tathaa vaayu inhen chaar dravyon kaa kaary rup main bhi astitv he
 In the opinion of these people, all the working substances are destroyed and they live in the sky in an atomic form
 yahi avasthaa "pralay" kehalaati he
 In this state, every individual soul exists with its mind and with the rites of deeds of previous births, and with religion and unrighteousness in the invisible form
 paratu is samay sristi kaa koi kaary nahin hota
 As a matter of fact, all things are waiting for the time when all the invincible functions of the organisms are ready to transform into form
 parantu adrusht jad he, sharir ke na hone se jeevatma bhi koi kaary nahin kar sakati, parmaanu aadi sabhi jad hai, phir "sristi" ke liye kriya kis prakaar utpann ho? In response to this, it should be known that for the welfare of the creatures that arise, a desire to create in the divine arises, due to which the unrivaled functions of the creatures become oriented
 parmaanuon main e prakaar kii kriya utpann ho jaati he, jisase ek parmaanu, duusare parmaanu se sanyukt ho jate hai
 a "mass" is produced by the addition of two atoms
 parthiv sharir ko utpann karne ke liye jo do parmaanu ikatthe hote hai ve parthiv parmaanu hai
 Both of them are synonyms of the "davanukas" generated
 un donon kaa sanyog asamavayikaaran he or adrusht, ishwar kii ichha, aadi nimittkaaran hai
 Similarly, aquatic, tajas etc
 should be understood in relation to the body
 yah samaran rakhana chahie ki sajaateey donon parmaanu maatr hi se sristi nahin hoti
 He is accompanied by an alien atom, such as an aqueous atom
 "dravyanuk" main anu-pariman he isliye vah drushtigochar nahin hota
 The work that will be generated from "the world" will also be atomic scale and that too will not be visible
 atev davyanuk se sthool kaary dravya ko utpann karne ke liye "teen sankhya" kii sahaayta lee jaati he
 In the nyaya-vaiseshika, gross matter is produced from matter and three numbers
 isliye yahan davyanuk kii teen sankhya se sthool dravya "tryanuk" yaa "trasarenu" kii utpatti hoti he
 The four triangles generate a quadrangle
 isi kram se pruthivi tathaa parthiv dravyon kii utpatti hoti he
 After the creation of matter, properties also arise in it
 yahi sristi kii prakriya he
 All the things that arise in the world are for the enjoyment of all the organisms that are born
 apane purvajanm ke karmon ke prabhaav se jeev sansar main utpann hota he
 In the same way, his body, vagina, clan, country, etc
 are all suited to enjoyment
 jab vah vishesh bhoga samaapt ho jaataa he, tab uski mrityu hoti he
 Similarly, at the end of their enjoyment, all living beings die
 nyaayamat - "sanhaar" ke liye bhi ek kram he
 In action, that is, in ghat, an action is produced in its components due to the strike
 us kriya se uske avyavon main vibhaag hota he, vibhaag se avyavi ke aarambhk sanyogon kaa naash hota he
 And then the component is destroyed
 isi kram se ishwar kii ichha se samast kaary dravyon kaa ek samay naash ho jaataa he
 It is clear from this that the termination of the termite is destroyed by the destruction of non-seasonal
 kabhi samavayikaaran ke naash se bhi kaarydravya kaa naash hota he
 Their aim is that the destroyed work cannot be destroyed without reason
 atev sristi kii tarah sanhaar ke liye bhi parmaanu main hi kriya utpann hoti he or parmaanu to nity he, uskaa naash nahin hota, kintu do parmaanuon ke sanyog kaa naash hota he or phir usase utpann "dravyanuk" rup kaary kaa tathaa usee kram se "tryanuk" evam "chaturanuk" tathaa anya kaaryon kaa bhi naash hota he
 According to macro vision, natural people do not think so subtle
 unke mat main aghat maatr hi se ek baargi sthool dravya nasht ho jaataa he
 Its properties are destroyed when the work material is destroyed
 isamen bhi purvawat do mat hai jinka nirupan "pakaj prakriya" main kiya gaya he
 Like the Nyaya Mantra, in the Vesic opinion, intellect, achievement, knowledge and suffix are words of similar meaning
 anya darshanon main ye sabhi shabd bhinn bhinn paribhaashik arth main prayukt hote hai
 Though there are many distinctions of the intellect, it has two distinct distinctions - "vidya" and "avidya", Avidya has four distinctions - Skepticism, Opportunity, non-business and Dream
 sanshay tathaa viparyay kaa nirupan nyaay main kiya gaya he
 There is no difference in their meaning in the Vaisesika faith
 anishchayatmak gyaan ko "anadhyavsaay" kehete hai
 For example, when looking at jackfruit, the narcotic islanders are suspicious of what it is when they see a cow with a cow, a cow, etc
 din bhar kaary karne se sharir ke sabhi ang thak jate hai
 They require rest
 indreu visheshkar thak jaati hai or man main leen ho jaati he
 Then the mind goes to rest in the full pulse through the psychotic pulse
 vahaan pahunchne ke pehle, purvakarmon ke sanskaron ke kaaran tathaa vaat, pitt or kaph in teenon ke vaishamy ke kaaran, adrusht ke sahare us samay man ko anek prakaar ke vishyon kaa pratyaksh hota he, jise swapngyaan kehete hai
 It should be kept in mind here that in the Vaisesika faith, "avidya" has been kept under knowledge and hence "avidya" is also called "false Knowledge"
 bahuton kaa kahana he ki ye donon shabd paraspar viruddh he
 The knowledge which is false cannot be called knowledge and the knowledge which is false can never be called false
 vidya bhi chaar prakaar kii he - pratyaksh, anumaan, smriti tathaa aarsh
 It is to be kept in mind here that "memory" in justice is not called realism
 vah to gyaat hi kaa gyaan he
 Similarly, "aarash Gyan" is not considered to be impermanent
 naiyayikon ke shabd yaa aagam ko anumaan main tathaa upmaan ko pratyaksh main vaisheshikon ne antarbhoot kiya he
 The sages who created the Veda have the knowledge of the past and the future as the direct
 usamen indriya or arth ke sannikarsh kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 This is called "pratibha" knowledge or "arshgyan"
 yah gyaan vishuddh at:karanwale jeev main bhi kabhi kabhi ho jaataa he
 Like - a pious girl says - tomorrow my brothers will come and literally tomorrow their brothers come
 yah "pratibh gyaan" he
 There is no difference of opinion between the two philosophies in the idea of direct and conjecture
 isliye pun: inkaa vichaar yahan nahin kiya gaya
 a very detailed discussion of karma has been done in Vaiseshika philosophy
 nyaay darshan main kahe gaye "karm" ke paanch bhedon ko ye log bhi unheen arthon main sweekaar karte hai
 These people have actually called the physical efforts "karma"
 phir bhi sabhi cheshtaayen praytn ke taratamya hi se hoti hai
 Therefore, in Vaiseshika philosophy, there are some karmas with regard to each of the above five distinctions and the effort in the tradition, which are called "sattrayatya-karma", some are without effort, which are called "aspatriya-karma"
 inke atirikt kuch aise karm hote hai, jaise prithvi aadi mahabhuton main, jo bina kisi praytn ke hote hai, unhen "apratyay-karm" kehete hai
 Looking at all these things, it is clear that there is a very subtle idea of the elements in the Vaisesika faith
 phir bhi sansaarik vishyon main nyaay ke mat main vaisheshik bahut sahamat he
 Therefore, these two are called "monarchies"
 in donon darshanon main jin batoo main "bhed" he, unamem se kuch bhedon kaa pun: ullekh yahan kiya jaataa he
 Both of these types of scriptures are also interrelated, keeping different views in certain principles
 inke anya siddhant paraspar lagu hote hai

 In Ayurveda, before starting the treatment, there is a provision for clinical examination and clinical examination
 arthath chikitsa ke purv pariksha atyant aavashyak he
 As far as the examination is concerned, the examination is both for the patient and also for the disease
 rog-rogi donon kii pariksha karke unka balaabal gyaan karke hi safal chikitsa kii ja sakati he
 Ayurvedicists have described the diagnosis for the examination of the disease
 ayurveda ke anusaar, rog kii pariksha in paanch upayon se hota he - These five measures are called diagnostics
 nidaan– rog ke kaaran ko nidaan kehete hai
 Poorforma - The symptoms that occur before the disease occurs are called Poorforma
 rup - utpann hue rogon ke chihnon ko lakshan yaa rup kehete hai
 Upasya - Pleasant use in the result of medicine, food and vihara is called upasya
 samprapti - rog kii ati praarambhik avasthaa se lekar rog ke purna rup se pragat hone tak, rog ke kriyaakaal kii chah avasthaayen hoti hai
 The diagnostician has knowledge of the force of the disease
 iske saath hi saath chikitsa hetu rogi ke bal kaa gyaan bhi aavashyak he
 Which decides whether the patient is able to tolerate therapy or not
 iske liye dashavidh pariksha kaa varnan aayaa he jiske antargat vikruti pariksha ko chhodkar shesh pariksha rogi ke bal ko jaanane ke liye he
 Upadhyaya is used for knowledge of disease in unknown disease, and for healing in known disease
 chha: prakaar ke upshay hai
 After multiplying with medicine, food and vihara, there are 18 distinctions of the epithelium, which are 18 types of medical practices
 in prakaaron main prakritik chikitsa, homeopathy tathaa aa
chi
vi
 sahit bhinn-bhinn chikitsa paddatiyon ke siddhanth sutara vidyaman hai
 For example, one of the major distinctions of subclinical therapy is 'allopathy' based on 'malignancy', which is basically the opposite of symptoms
 maatr lakshan vipareet aushadh se taatkaalik rup se rog kaa shaman hota he, kintu chikitsa ke lakshya, 'dhaatusatmya' kii siddhi anishchit he
 Ayurveda also has an important place for antiviral therapy, such as the pillar medicine is used to stop the motion of diarrhea, but the important thing is that it has no harmful side effects
 allopathy maatr lakshanatmak chikitsa paddati hoti to bhi sweekaarya hoti parantu yah dushprabhav yukt tathaa hanikaarak he, isaliye vinaashkari he or aisi dushprabhav yukt chikitsa ko ayurveda 'chikitsa' hi nahin maanata
 From the earliest stages of the disease to the complete manifestation of the disease, there are six stages of the course of the disease- dosha ke sanchay, prakope, prasar tathaa sthaan sanshray rogon kii purvarup avasthaa he
 Symptoms of disease arise in manifestation and disease is manifested
 bhed avasthaa rog kii jeern avasthaa he
 That is, the accumulation of faults, the wrath, the pressure, the location, the person and the person who knows the distinction is the real doctor
 rogon kii ati praarambhik avasthaa main hi tridosh asantulan ko nimna upayon se, bina kisi blad test yaa eksre aadi dwaara jaanch kar rog kaa nidaan kiya jaataa hanaadi pareekshan, mel-mutr, netra, jihva, swar, sparsh evam akruti pareekshan
 It is considered best to treat in the pre-existing conditions as much as possible because if accumulation
 kaal main hi chikitsa kar di jaae to dosha naa aage badhegaa or na rog utpann hoga

 Sagan has written frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science, expressing his doubts about the traditional concept of God, a superior being

 From some hidden astronomical point of view of human beings, there is no compelling evidence for the human patriarch controlling the fate of humans, but to deny the existence of physical laws would be insane

 This God is emotionally satisfying 


 it doesn't matter much to pray to the law of gravity
 naastikta par, saagan ne 1981 main tippanee kii: An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who is a compelling proof against the existence of God
 i do not know any such compelling evidence because God is taken to distant times and places and to the ultimate cause
 Maybe, we need to know a lot about the universe to confirm that no such god exists

 terbine ek ghurni ingine he jo kisi taral kii gatij yaa / tathaa sthitij urja ko grahan karke swayan gumti he or apane shoft par lage anya yantron ko ghumaati he
 Wind mill and water mill etc
 are the initial forms of turbines
 vidyut shakti ke utpaadan main terbinon kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 Gas, steam and water-fired turbines differ from each other
 gas compressure yaa pump bhi terbine jaisaa hi hota he par yah terbine ke ulta kaary karata he
 The turbine has at least one rotor assembly that drives this machine with its shaft or drum with one or more blades
 blade par taral padaarth yaa anya padaarth dabaav daalata he jisase roter yaa ghurni chalati he
 It provides kinetic energy to the rotor and rotor
 gas, bhaap or jal terbine main aamtaur par blade ke aasapaas ek aavaran hota he jo drav kii maatra ko niyantrit karata he
 The term "turbine" was coined in 1822 by French mining engineer Claude Burdine from the Latin turbo word
 iskaa ullekh ek sansmaran main unhone kiya tha jo royal science academy paris ko prastut kiya gaya tha
 Benoit Fornerone, an alumnus of Claude Burdine, built the first practical water turbine

 Normally the degree of reaction and impulse varies at the root of its circumference blade ab agar tarabine kii karypranali kii baat karen to yah newton ke tisare gati niyam ke adhaar par kaam karti he
 That is, on every action, the opposite reaction occurs
 isi tarah tarabine kaa propeller kaam karata he
 The spindle in the propeller exerts pressure on air or water
 isi dabaav kii vajah se propeller tarabine ko peeche kii ore dhakka martha he, jisase vah chalati he
 Usually the turbine is kept in one place, so that whenever the water passes through it, it is driven by the pressure on each blade of the turbine
 The same rule applies with wind or water turbines
 jitna adhik pani yaa hawa kaa pravaah hoga, tarabine utani tej gati se chalegi
 The working fluid consists of pressure energy and kinetic energy
 drav sampidit yaa asampidit kiya ja saktaa he
 Turbines are employed to collect this energy by implantation of several physical principles
 aaveg terbinon main ucch veg taral yaa gas jet ke pravaah kaa upyog roter blade kii disha badalane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The resulting impulse rotates the turbine and the gas or fluid exits at a slower rate
 is shabd kii vibhinn paribhaashaayen di jaati hai
 According to the detailed definition, a gas turbine is the basic conductor in which the working fluid remains in the gaseous state throughout the thermal cycle and whose speed of all the devices is rotating
 sankeern paribhaasha ke anusaar is shabd kaa prayog sirf us mukhya tarabine ang ke liye kiya jaataa he jiskaa madhyam garam vaayu hoti he
 According to some scholars, a gas turbine is a device in which the flow process is continuous and power is obtained by the turbine

 a steam turbine is a conductor, in which the high-speed steam is driven into a rotor by converting the heat energy of the steam into kinetic energy, and colliding on a number of panels that rotate and operate
 anyonyagtik bhaap ingine main bhaap kii sthitik daab dwaara piston par kaary kiya jaataa he
 Although the steam in the engine moves with the piston, the effect of the kinetic energy of steam in the action of the engine is negligible
 bhaap tarabine main bhaap ingine kii apeksha ucchtar gati mil sakati he or gatisima bhi badi ha sakati he
 Turbine parts have good balance
 bhaap kii samaan maatra evam samaan avasthaa main bhaap tarabine bhaap ingine se adhik shakti paidaa kar saktaa he

 The steam turbine is the most durable of all the original drivers on earth
 tarabine se sabase bada laabh yah hota he ki isse ghurnak gati sidhe praapt hoti he, jabaki bhaap ingine main anyonyagati se ghurnak gati praapt karne ke liye alag se upadan kaa vyavahar karnaa padataa he
 In a vaporizer, steam is produced at high pressure and temperature
 jab yah bhaap tarabine ke paas pahunchati he, us samay isamen adhik maatra main ushma urja hoti he or isaki daab bhi itani adhik hoti he ki yah nimnadaab tak prasaarit ho sakati he
 But at that time its kinetic energy is negligible
 at: bhaap kuch kaary kar sake iske pehle isaki ushma urja ko gatij urja main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 This change occurs in the well-designed device, expanding the steam
 bhaap kaa prasar yaa to ek hi kriya main purna kiya jaataa he, yaa vibhinn kriyaaon main
 This means that many stationary devices are put into practice to convert heat energy into kinetic energy and often a moving device is placed between two stationary devices
 sthir upkaran main praapt gatij urja ko uske baad bandhe hue gatiman upkaran ke upar kaary karne ke liye lagaaya jaataa he
