 Deva Samhita is a collection of Sanskrit shlokas written by Gorakh Sinha in the Medieval period, in which the birth of the Jat caste, the deeds and the origin of Jats are mentioned in the form of dialogue between Shiva and Parvati
 thakur deshraj likhte hai ki jaaton kii utpatti ke sambandh main ek katha kahi jaati he
 King Daksha of Mahadevji made a yajna and almost all other gods were called in the yagna but neither invited Mahadevji nor invited his daughter Sati
 pita kaa yajna samaj kar sati bina bulaae hi pahunch gayi, kintu jab usne vahaan dekha ki na to unke pati kaa bhaag hi nikaala gaya he or na uskaa hi satkar kiya gaya isliye usne vahiin pranant kar die
 mahadevaji ko jab yah samachar mila, to unhone daksh or uske salaahkaaron ko dand dene ke liye apni jataa se 'virbhadra' naamak gana utpann kiya
 Virbhadra came with his other fellow ganas and cut off Daksha's head and also punished his companions completely
 It is not only the legend but it is composed in Sanskrit shlokas which is known as Devasahita
 isamen likhaa he ki vishnu ne aakar shivaji ko prasann karke unke vardaan se daksh ko jivit kiya or daksh or shivaji main samajhota karaane ke baad shivaji se prarthana kii ki maharaj aap apane matanuai 'jaaton' kaa yagyopavit sanskaar kyon nahin karvaa lete? taaki hamaare bhakt vaishnav or aapke bhakton main koi jhagada na rahe
 lekin shivaji ne vishnu kii is prarthana par yah uttar diya ki mere anuyai bhi pradhan hai
 Some of the verses of Devasamhita are as follows: arth- he bhagwan! he bhutesh! he sarv dharm visharadon main shreshth! he swamin!aap krupa karke mere tain jat jati kaa janm evam karm kathan kijiye

 14
 
 arth- shivaji bole ki jat mahabali hai, maha veeryavan or bade parakramee hai kshatriya prabhruti kshitipaalon ke purv kaal main yah jati hi prithvi par raaje-maharaaje raheen
 The Jat caste is superior to the deity caste and are strong-pledged

 Informally, this means that an irrational number cannot be represented as a simple fraction
 udhaaharan ke liye 2 kaa vargamul, or pai aparimey sankhyaayein hai
 It can be proved that irrational numbers are typically real numbers that cannot be represented as terminals or continuous decimals, although mathematicians do not take this as a definition
 cantre pramaan ke parinamswaroop ki vaastavik sankhyaayein agananeey hai yah maanata he ki lagbhag sabhi vaastavik sankhyaayein aparimey hai
 Perhaps, the most well known irrational numbers are π, e and √2
when the ratio of the length of two line segments is irrational, the line segments are also described as incommensurable, they do not share any measure in common
 In this sense the measure of a line segment l is a line segment j whose "measure" is l in the sense that the number of all copies of j from one end to the other end achieves the same length as l

 The first evidence for the existence of irrational numbers is generally attributed to a Pythagorean who probably discovered them while identifying the sides of the pentagram

 However, the fifth century BC
 Hippasus was able to deduce that there is in fact no common unit of measurement and that the assertion of such an existence is indeed a contradiction

 According to another legend, Hippasus was exiled only for this revelation
 hipasus ko khud jo bhi parinaam bhugatne pade hon, uski khoj ne paithagorian ganit ke samaksh ek bahut gambhir samasya khadi kar di, kyonki isane is dharna ko dhwast kar diya ki sankhya or jyamiti aviyojya hai-unke siddhant kaa aadhaar
 Theodorus of Siren proves the irrationality of the radicals up to 17, but stayed there probably because the algebra he used could not be applied to the square root of 17
 And when Eudoxus developed the theory of proportions In which irrational as well as rational ratios were taken care of, then only the strong mathematical foundations of irrational numbers were created
 a magnitude "was not a number, but was for existence such as line segment, angle, area, volume and time which we can say can be continuously varied

 The 17th century saw imaginary numbers becoming a powerful tool in the hands of Abraham de Mover, and especially Leonard Euler
 The completion of the theory of complex numbers in the nineteenth century required the differentiation of irrationals into algebraic and transcendental numbers, proof of the existence of transcendental numbers, and the revival of scientific studies of irrational theory that has been largely ignored since Euclid

 2 ke vargamul kii aparimeyata use parimey maanate hue or ek virodhabhas kaa nishkarsh nikaalte hue siddh kii ja sakati he, jise ridkshio aid absrdam dwaara ek tark kaha jaataa he
 The following argument appeals twice to the fact that the square of an odd integer is always odd
 yadi √2 parimey he, to purnank m,n ke liye iskaa rup m / n he, jahaan donon sam nahin hai
 Then m 2 = 2n 2, so m is even, say m = 2p
 Thus 4p 2 = 2n 2 therefore 2p 2 = n 2 so n is even, which is a contradiction
 do ke vargamul ke liye uparyukt saboot ko ankaganit ke moulik prameya ke upyog dwaara samanyikrut kiya ja saktaa he, jise 1798 main gaus dwaara sabit kiya gaya tha
 This reinforces that every integer has unique factorization in the prime
 iskaa istemaal karte hue ham yah dikhaa sakate hai ki yadi ek parimey sankhya ek purnank nahin he to uskaa koi abhinn ghaat ek purnank nahin ho saktaa he, kyonki apane nunatam pad main har main ek gunankhand hona chahie jo ganak se vibhajit nahin hota chaahe donon hi kisi bhi ghaat tak badha die jaaen
 isliye agar ek purnank, ek anya purnank kaa sateek k waan ghaat nahin he to uskaa k waan varg aparimey he
 The numbers that are most easily proved to be irrational are some special logarithms
 yahaan ridkshio aid absrdam dwaara ek saboot he ki log2 3 aparimey he
 Note that log2 3 ≈ 1
58> 0
 maan lijiye ki log2 3 parimey he
 For some positive integers m and n, we have iskaa matlab he ki However, the number 2 that is raised to any positive integer power must be even and the number 3 that is raised to any positive integer power must be odd
 Obviously, an integer cannot be both even and odd at the same time: we have a contradiction
 jo ekmaatr anumaan hamane lagaaya tha vah tha ki log2 3 parimey he 
 virodhabhas kaa matlab he ki yah dharna zarur galat hogi, yani log2 3 aparimey he or ise kabhi bhi purnank m / n ke ek bhagfal ke rup main vyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa he jahaan n ≠ 0 he
 Cases like log10 2 can also be treated in a similar way
 lagbhag sabhi aparimey sankhyaayein abijiy hai or sabhi abijiy sankhyaayein aparimey hai: abijiy sankhya vaala lekh kai udaahranon ko soochibaddh karata he
 er and πr are irrational if r ≠ 0 is rational; e π is irrational
 aparimey sankhya ko nirmit karne kaa doosraa tarika he aparimey bijiy sankhya ke rup main nirmaan, yani purnank gunank ke saath bahupad ke shunya ke rup main: bahupad sameekaran ke saath shuru kijiye Where the coefficients ai are integers
 maan lijie aap jaanate hai ki kuch vaastavik sankhyaayein x maujuud hai jahaan p = 0 
 is bahupad sameekaran kaa ekmaatr sambhavit parimey mul r / s swaroop main hoga jahaan r, a 0 kaa ek bhaajak he or s, a n kaa ek bhaajak he; aise keval simit ummidavaar hai jise aap sirf haathon se jaanch sakate hai
 If neither of them is a root of p, then x must be irrational
 udhaaharan ke liye, is takanic kaa istemaal yah dikhaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki x = 1 / 3 aparimey he: hamaare paas he 2 = 2 or isliye x 6 - 2x 3 - 1 = 0 or is baad vaale bahupad main koi parimey mul nahin he 
 Because algebraic numbers constitute a region, many irrational numbers can be constructed by combining algebraic and transcendental numbers
 udhaaharan ke liye 3π + 2, π + √2 or e √3 aparimey hai 
 The decimal expansion of an irrational number never repeats or ends unlike a rational number
 yah darshane ke liye, maan lijiye ham n purnank ko m dwaara bhaag dete hai 
 jab m dwaara n ke bhaag par deergh bhaag ko lagu kiya jaataa he, to keval m sheshfal sambhav hote hai
 If 0 appears as a remainder, the decimal expansion ends
 yadi 0 kabhi prakat nahin hota to vah elgorithm, kisi bhi sheshfal ko ek baar se adhik upyog naa karte hue adhik se adhik m - 1 charan chal saktaa he
 After that, a remainder must recur and then the decimal expansion repeats
 iske vipareet, maan lijiye hamaare saamne ek aavarti dashamalav aata he, to ham siddh kar sakate hai ki vah do purnankon kaa bhinn he
 for example: yahaan repitend kii lambaai 3 he
 We multiply by 103: dhyaan den ki jab hamane 10 ke ghaate dohraye jane vaale bhaag kii lambaai se guna kiya, to hamane ankon ko dashamalav bindu ke bain ore thik utane hi sthanon se sthanantarit kiya
 Therefore, the back end of 1000A exactly matches the back end of A
 yahaan, donon 1000A or a ke sire main 162 doharaav he
 Therefore, when we subtract a from both sides, the back end of 1000A cancels out from the rear end of A: phir 
 Alternatively, since 0
5 = 1 / 2, a person can clear the fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2: 
 The last line, 53 / 74, is a quotient of integers and is therefore a rational number
 yahaan ek prasiddh shuddh astitv yaa gaiyr-rachanaatmak pramaan he: There exist two irrational numbers a and b, such that ab is rational
 vastav main, agar √2√2 parimey he, tab maaniye ki a = b = √2
 anyathaa, maan lijiye ki a aparimey sankhya √2√2 he or b = √2
 to phir a b = √2 = 2√2·√2 = √22 =2 jo parimey he
 Although the above argument does not decide between the two cases, the Gelfond – Schneider theorem implies that √2√2 is transcendental, hence irrational
 yah gyaat nahin he ki kya π + e athwa π - e aparimey he yaa nahin
 In fact, there is no pair of non-zero integers m and n about which m π + ne is irrational or not
 iske alaava, yah gyaat nahin he ki set q par bijganit ke anusaar swatantra he yaa nahin
 It is not known whether 2e, πe, π√2, the Catalan constant, or the Euler – Meshcheroni gamma constant γ are irrational
 chunki vaastavik ek agananeey set kaa gathan karte hai, jinamein se parimey ek gananeey subset hote hai, aparimey kaa poorak seppeganneey he
 In the ordinary remote verb d = | x - y |, the real number is a metric space and therefore also a topological space
 euclidian sudur kriya ko simit karne se aparimey ko ek metric spes kii sanrachana milti he
 Since the subspace of the irrationals is not closed, the triggered metric is not complete
 haalanki, ek purna metric sthaan main G-delta set hote hue - arthath khule subset kaa ek gananeey pratichhedan - aparimey kaa sthaan sansthitiki rup se purna he: arthath, aparimey par ek metric he jo thik waisi hi sansthitiki ko utprerit karata he jaisaa ki euclidian metric kaa pratibandh karata he, lekin jiske sambandh main aparimey purna hai
 One can also see this by being ignorant of the above-mentioned fact about the G-delta set: the continuous fraction expansion of an irrational number defines a homomorphism from the place of the irrational to the location of all positive integers, which is easily complete Is seen as metricable
 iske alaava, sabhi aparimey ke set, kate hue ek metric-yogya sthaan hai
 In fact, the irrational has the basis of the klopen set so the space is zero-dimensional

 Jinnah's differences with the Congress began at the same time when Gandhiji emerged in Indian politics in 1918
 gandhiji ne raajnneeti main ahimsaatmak savinay avagya or hindu mulyon ko badhaava diya

 jinna kaa maananaa tha ki sirf sanvaidhanik sangharsh se hi aazaadee pai ja sakati he
 
 Unlike other Congress leaders, Gandhiji did not wear foreign clothes, used Hindi more and more in place of English and Sanatan used Hindu thinking in politics
 yahi kuch kaaran the ki gandhiji ko apaar lokapriyata mili
 Gandhiji supported the Khilafat movement while Jinnah openly opposed it

 Jinnah resigned from Congress in 1920
 iske saath hi, unhone yah bhi chetavanee di ki gandhiji ke jansangharsh kaa siddhant hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich vibhaajan ko badhaayegaa kam nahin karegaa

 However, in this election, he had to face severe defeats in Muslim dominated Punjab, Sindh and North West Frontier Province
 jinna ne congress ko gathbandhan ke liye aamantrit kiya
 At first they both decided that they would face the British together, but Jinnah stipulated that the Congress would have to consider a separate constituency for Muslims and the Muslim League as representative of the Muslims of India, which the Congress rejected
 congress main us samay kai muslim netaa the, isliye lig ko bhartiya musalamaanon kaa pratinidhi maananaa uske liye aasaan nahin tha
 Jinnah also held talks with several Congress leaders and the Congress also proposed to merge the League into Congress, but the talks nevertheless failed

 In a speech by the Muslim League in 1930, Mohammad Iqbal gave the North West Indian state of India, not the country of Pakistan

 After negotiations with the Congress failed, Jinnah also got the idea that Muslims should have to find a separate country to protect their rights without it working
 aage chalakar jinna kaa yah vichaar bilkul pakkaa ho gaya ki hindu or musalmaan donon alag-alag desh ke naagarik hai at: unhen alahada kar diya jaye
 His idea was later called Jinnah's theory of dualism

 Jinnah also raised this point in correspondence with Iqbal

 film pakistani darshakon ke bich lokapriy rahi or isane "rushdi ko ek rembo sadrush charitra ke rup main prastut kiya, jiskaa peechha chaar pakistani gorilla karte hai
 The British Board of Film Classification denied it the certificate's permission because, "it was felt that portraying Rushdie rather than just tarnishing his image, causing breach of peace, could be considered criminal libel
" is qadam ne britain main prabhavi dhang se film par purna pratibandh laga diya
 However, two months later, Rushdie himself wrote to the board, stating that in his opinion the film was "a perverted, incompetent worthless creation" and that he would not sue if it was screened
 baad main unhone kaha, "agar us film par pratibandh laga diya jaataa, to vah shahar main sarvaadhik icchit video ban jaataa, har koi use dekh letaa
 "while the film was a massive success in Pakistan, it virtually failed to attract anyone's attention in the West
 unhone kaha ki film kaa ek hissaa sahi myanon main haasyaaspad tha, jab unka charitra unki pustak saetanic varsej ko pard kar ek pakistani ladaaku ko yatnaa detaa he
 On 16 June 2007, Rushdie was awarded a knighthood for services to literature at the Queens Birthday Honors
 unhone kaha, "is mahaan sammaan ko praapt kar main romanchit or vinamr hoon or bahut abhaari hoon ki mere kaam ko is tarah se pahchaan mili he
 "in response to his knight's title, Muslim-majority countries staged protests
 in deshon ke kai sansad sadasyon ne is kriya kii ninda kii or iran or pakistan ne apane british rajdooton ko aupchaarik rup se virodh pradarshan ke bulaayaa
 Massive demonstrations took place in Pakistan and Malaysia against the title of Knight of Rushdie
 Many publicly demanded his death
 kuch gaiyr-musalmaan bhi rushdi kii nite kii padavi se niraash the, yah maanate hue ki lekhak aise sammaan kii yogyata nahin rakhata he
 According to a BBC July 2007 report, al Qaeda has also condemned Rushdie's honor
 al kaayda ke up pramukh aimaan al zawaahiri ko ek audio recording main yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he ki bharat main janme rushdi ke liye britain kaa puraskaar "islam kaa apmaan" he or vah "ek bahut hi sateek pratikriya" kii yojana bana rahaa he
 Rushdie comes from a Shia Muslim family, but says he has never really been religious
 1990 main, "aashaa he yah, fatve ke mutabik unhen maarane ke prayaas main muslimon ke khatre ko kam karegaa," unhone ek bayaan diya jisamen yah daawa kiya ki "unhone apni muslim aasthaa ko naveekrut kiya he, islam par apane upanyaas main hamale kii ninda kii he or duniya bhar main is dharm kii behatar samaj ke liye kaam karne ke liye patibaddhta jataayi
 "but later said that they were only doing" drama "
 unki kitaaben aksar samaaj main dharm kii bhoomika, vibhinn aasthaaon ke bich or dharmik or bina aasthaa waalon ke bich takaraav par prakaash daalati hai
 Rushdie, developed during the late 19th century, advocates higher criticism
 rushdi, da washington post main chhapi atithi kii raay main or madhya agast 2005 ke da times main islam main sudhaar kii maang karte hai
 Excerpts from his speech: rushdi ne yugoslavia ke sangheey ganraajya par 1999 main NATO kii bambaari kaa samarthan kiya, jiske kaaran vampanthi tarik ali ne rushdi or anya "yoddha lekhakon" ko "pariyudhak" ke rup main sambodhit kiya
 Rushdie backed the us-led campaign to oust the Taliban in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, but was a vocal critic of the 2003 war in Iraq
 unhone kaha ki jahaan "saddaam hossain ko hataane ke liye maamla banaaya janaa tha", america kaa ekatarfa sainya hastkshep anuchit tha
 As a result of the "danish cartoon case" in March 2006 - considered by many to be a sting of death threats and edicts given after the publication of The Satanic Verses in 1989 - Rushdie made a cautionary statement against the dangers of religious extremism Signed the manifesto 'together Facing the New Totalitarianism'
 The manifesto was published in 2006 in the left-leaning French weekly Charlie Hebdo
 varsh 2006 main rushdi ne kaha ki ve tatkaaleen house of comons ke netaa, jaik straw kii tippanee kaa samarthan karte hai jinhone nakaab pahanane kii aalochana kii
 Rushdie said that his three sisters would never veil
 unhone kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki ghunghat ke khilaaf ladaai, mahilaon kii hadon ke khilaaf ek lambii or satat ladaai rahi he, atah us arth main main puri tarah se kii taraf hoon
 " rushdi apane raajnneetik vichaaron ke liye british shaikshik pratishthanon ke krodh kaa shikaar hote rahete hai
 Marxist critic Terry Eagleton, formerly an admirer of Rushdie's works, attacked him for his approach, saying he "expressed joy at the Pentagon's criminal actions in Iraq and Afghanistan"
 haalaanki, tadnantar unhone rushdi ke vichaaron ko galat rup main prastut karne ke liye maafee maangi
 During a presentation at 92nd Street Y, Rushdie expressed his views on copyright when asked a question whether he considered copyright law to be an impediment to free expression
 No
 But that's because i write for a living, and i have no other source of income, and i Naïvely believe that stuff that i create belongs to me, and that if you want it you might have to give me some cash
 My view is i do this for a living
 The thing wouldn't exist if i didn't make it and so it belongs to me and don't steal it
 You know
 It's my stuff

 In the absence of oxygen, the organic matter chemically decomposes when heated

 madhya bhartiya arya parivaar kii bhashaa ardhamagadhi sanskrit or aadhunik bhartiya bhashaaon ke bich kii ek mahatvapurn kadi he
 It was the literary and colloquial language of Magadha in ancient times
 jain dharm ke 24wein tirthankar mahavir swami ne isi bhashaa main apane dharmopadesh kiye the
 Later, Mahavira's disciples also collected Mahavir's teachings in Ardhamagadhi which became known as Agam
 hemchandra acharya ne ardhamagadhi ko 'aarsh praakrit' kaha he
 The word Ardhamagadhi is interpreted in many ways: is bhashaa main vipul jain evam loukik sahitya kii rachana kii gai
 Mahavir Swami, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, delivered his sermons in this language
 aage chalakar mahavir ke shishyon ne ardhamagadhi main mahavir ke upadeshon kaa sangrah kiya jo aagam naam se prasiddh hue
 From time to time there were three recitations of Jain proceeds
 antim vaachana mahaviranirvana ke 1,000 varsh baad, isvi san kii chhathi shatabdi ke aarambh main, devardhigani kshamaakshaman ke adhinaayakatv main valbhi main hui jab jain aagam vartmaan rup main lipibaddh kiye gaye
 In the meantime, there were many changes in Jain proceeds in terms of language and subject
 in parivartanon ke hone par bhi aacharang, sutarakrutang, uttaradhyayan, dashaivakalik aadi jain aagam paryaapt pracheen or mahatvapurn hai
 These proceeds are valid only by the Shvetambara Jain tradition, according to the Digambara Jains they have disappeared
 aagmon ke uttarkalin jain sahitya kii bhashaa ko ardhamagadhi na kahkar praakrit kaha gaya he
 This proves that Jainism was propagated outside Magadha at that time

 kabhi kabhaar ise angreji main parmyriad bhi kah diya jaataa he jiskaa shabdic arth hi he prati das hazaar
 But the use of these two words is not the same and permairad can possibly cause trouble
 udhaaharan ke liye 10 aadhaar ankon main yadi ek badhaayaa jaae to saamanytah samajha jaataa he ki parinaam 11 aadhaar ank hoga; lekin yadi If used interchangeably, the permyriad is potentially confusing because an increase of one basis point to a 10 basis point value is generally understood to mean an increase to 11 basis points; not an increase of one part in ten thousand, meaning an increase to 10
001 basis points
 Paramyriad is represented by the ‱ sign, which is similar in appearance to the "percent" sign, but at the end is two zeros higher
 ek aadhaar ank kii paribhaasha is prakaar he: Aadhaar marks are used in a convenient way in most contexts where intervals of less than one percent are to be considered
 iskaa ek pramukh udhaaharan vittiya bazaaron main byaaj daren hai jinamein utaar chadhaav aamtaur par ek pratishat se kam ho sakate hai
 In this case, it is more convenient to talk in base points
 yani, 0
10% ke antar ko 10 aadhaar ankon kaa parivartan kaha jayega
 For example, see this expression - increasing the repo rate by 25 basis points, from 7
5 percent to 7
75 percent
 duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to 100 aadhaar ankon kaa arth hoga ek pratishat
 Like percentage points, basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate
 For example, if a report says there has been a "1% increase" from a 10% interest rate, this could refer to an increase either from 10% to 10
1%, or from 10% to 11%
 If, however, the report says there has been a "100 basis point increase" from a 10% interest rate, then we know that the interest rate of 10% has increased by 1
00% to an 11% rate
 It is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument, or the difference between two interest rates, including the yields of fixed-income securities
 Since certain loans and bonds may usually be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security, they will often be quoted as a spread over the index
 For example, a loan that bears interest of 0
50% per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate is said to be 50 basis points over LIBOR, which is commonly expressed as "L + 50bps" or simply "L + 50"
 The term "basis point" has its origins in trading the "basis" or the spread between two interest rates
 Since the basis is usually small, these are quoted multiplied up by 1 xxrep 4 0 , and hence a "full point" movement in the "basis" is a basis point
 Contrast with pips in FX forward markets
 The relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as follows: 1 percentage point change = 100 basis points, and 0
01 percentage points = 1 basis point
 So, a bond whose yield increases from 5% to 5
5% is said to increase by 50 basis points; or interest rates that have risen 1 percentage point are said to have increased by 100 basis points

 rail parivahan kaa ek zariyaa he jisamen yatriyon or maal ko patariyon par chalane vaale vaahanon par ek sthaan se dusre sthaan le jaaya jaataa he
 Traditionally, there are wheels under railway vehicles that run balanced on two tracks made of steel, but in modern times arrangements such as a 'maglev' hanging above the track with a magnetic effect and a monorail running on a track Are also counted in the railway system
