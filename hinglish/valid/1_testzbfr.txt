 Initially Mother's Day was celebrated in Japan during the Showa period as the birthday of Queen Kojun
 aajkal yah ek vipanan chuttee he jisamen log gulnar ke phool or gulab uphaar ke rup main dete hai
 The government of वारlvaro Obregón, in collaboration with the Excelsior newspaper, adopted the holiday from America in 1922, for which a tremendous promotion campaign was launched that year
 roodhiwaadee sarkaar ne is chuttee ko maataaon ko apane parivaar main adhik roodhiwaadee bhoomika nibhaane ke liye istemaal kiya tha jisaki samaajwaadiyon ne aalochana karte hue kaha tha ki ye auraton kii ek asaty chhavi ko badaawa dete hai jiske anusaar aurat prajnan mashin se zyada kuch nahin hai
 In the mid-1930s the government of Lazaro Kardens promoted it as a "festival of patriotism"
 kardens sarkaar ne is chuttee kaa upyog vibhinn prayaason ke liye ek saadhan ke rup main yah sochate hue kiya ki parivaar kaa raashtra ke vikaas main bahut yogadan hota hai or mexican logon main apni maa ke prati vafadari kaa laabh uthaate hue carch or catholic prathaon ke prabhaavon ko kam karte hue menxican mahilaon main nai naitikta kaa sutarapaat kiya
 The government sponsored a holiday in schools
 haalanki, naatakashala ke naatakon ne sarkaar ke in sakht nirdeshon ko nazarandaaj kar diya or is prakaar ke naatak dharmik pratikon or vishyon se bhar gaye or sarkaar kii anek cheshtaaon ke baavjood ye "rashtriya samaaroh" "dharmik tyohaar" ban gaye
 Soledad Orozco Garcia, the wife of President Manuel Avila Camacho, promoted the holiday making it an important state-sponsored event during the 1940s
 1942 kaa utsav ek puure hafte tak chalaa, jisamen yah ghoshnaa karvaa di gayi ki sabhi mahilaayein pavned silaai mashiinon ko monte de piedaad se bina mulya punah praapt kar sakati hai
 The Catholic National Synarchist Association began paying attention to the promotion of the Orozcos on holidays around 1941
 mexican kranti ke sadasyon jinaki dukaane thim, unka rivaaj tha ki vinamr varg kii mahilaayein maat diwas par unki dukaanon par jaakar koi bhi uphaar muft main lekar apane ghar aakar parivaar waalon ko de sakati hai
 Synarchists were concerned that this would promote both materialism and laziness of the lower class and in turn strengthen the methodological social problems of the country
 aajkal ham dekhte hai ki vah chuttee kii pratha bahut roodhiwaadee ban gayi he, 1940 kaa UNS nazar rakhe tha is chuttee ke aadhunikeekaran par jo us samay vyapak bahes kaa ek bhaag tha
 This economic modernization was inspired by the American ideal and the state sponsored it, and the fact that the holiday was originally imported from the US was the only evidence, an attempt to impose capitalization and materialism on Mexican society
 iske alaava, UNS or leone nagar ke padri ne sarkari kaaryon main yah dekha ki ve chuttee ko kisi loukik-kaary main laga kar samaaj main mahilaon kii sakriy bhoomika ko badhaava dene ke saath, purushon ko dirghakaalik atmik rup se kamjor bana diya jab mahilaon ne apni paaramparik bhoomika ko parityakt kar diya
 He also sought these holidays as a proverbial act of the Virgin Mary cult, a major internal effort was underway to decriminalize many holidays, which he tried to ban extensively, and the religious women from state programs
 i tried to help him and "depegnize" him
 usee samay 1942 main soledaad kaa chuttee kaa sabase bade utsav ke rup main, padariyon ne leone main virgin meri kaa 210waan anushtan samaaroh ek bade parade ke saath yojit kiya
 There is a mismatch between scholarly views that the Mexican government abandoned the revolution during the 1940s, including affecting Mother's Day
 aajkal mexico main matra diwas or virgin meri donon hi chuttee kaa ek utsav hai

 In ancient times, Lord Shri Krishna's mother Devaki walked out of the house to see the natural scenery
 unhone kai sthanon kaa daura kiya or ghar lautne main bahut der kar di
 Lord Krishna became unhappy when his mother did not return
 ve apni maa kii talash main kai sthanon par ghoomte rahe parantu unhen safalataa nahin mili
 Finally, when he reached the "mata Tirtha Kund", he saw his mother taking a bath in the pond
 bhagwaan krishna apni maa ko dekh kar bahut khush hue or apni samast shokapurna ghatana jo unki mata kii anupasthiti main hui thi unke aage kehane lage
 Mother Devaki said to Lord Krishna that "oh, son Krishna, then let this place be a holy place for children to meet their late mothers"
 Then it is a legend that this place has become a holy pilgrimage where devotees And devotees come to pay obeisance to their late mothers
 saath hi yah bhi kinvadanti hai ki ek bhakt ne apni maa kii chhavi ko talab main dekha or uske andar gir kar uski mrityu ho gai

 Piku is an Indian comedy film which released in theaters on 08 May 2015
 is film main amitabh bachchan deepika padukon ke pita kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai
 Piku Banerjee is a Bengali architect living in Delhi, with his 70-year-old father Bhashkor
 bhashkar ko puraani kabj ke saath samasyaayein hoti hai or har aant ko unke antra andolanon main nishaan milti he
 Their habits often quarrel with the servants and annoy Chobi Mashi, who often visits them
 piku apane pita se pyaar karata he or, kyonki uski maa kii mrityu ho gai he, uski acchhee dekhbhaal karata he lekin kabhi-kabhi uski vilakshantaa ke kaaran uske saath behad pareshaan ho jaataa he
 His colleague Syed Afroz is a good friend, and he is a regular customer of Syed's friend, Rana Chaudhary taxi business
 rana kii apni maa or bahan ke saath apni paariwarik samasyaayein hai
 Piku wants to sell his ancestral house in Champakunj, Kolkata, but Bhaskar strongly sells items and decides to move to Kolkata
 piku ko uske saath janaa he, kyonki vah use akele yatra nahin kar sakati he
 Bhashkor brings his constipation problem and decides to travel by road
 rana ke anya chaalkon ke saath piku bahut hi samasyagrast hone ke kaaran, ve piku kii yatra se pehle waapas chale gaye
 Piku, frustrated with the agency, tries to book a flight, but soon, Rana takes himself to Kolkata to inform his family about the journey in his family
 vaise, samooh bhasmakor ke ugr vyavhaar or kabj ke kaaran dhairya khone ke kagaar par rana samet kai ghatnaon se muqabla karata he
 They eventually reach Kolkata, where Piku's relatives live in the old house and ask Bhashkor Rana to stay for some time
 piku or rana shahar main baahar nikalate hai or dhire-dhire kareeb aate hai
 Rana also signals to sell the house during the discussion
 rana agle din kolkata chhodti he or bhaskar se apni vilakshantaa ko rokane ke liye kahati he jise vah antat sunata he
 Piku changes his mind and decides not to sell the house
 is bich, bhaskar kii cycle kii achaanak ichha bad jaati he kyonki vah akele shahar ke ek hisse ke madhyam se chakra chalaata he, jisase har koi tanaav mahasoos karata he kyonki usne unhen iske bare main nahin bataaya tha
 When Bhushkar returns, Piku forces him to eat street food and be irresponsible, but he simply states that his constipation has cleared up and he needs a bicycle every day
 vah rana ko yaad karata he jisane use sabakuch khaane ke liye kaha tha or bhojan ke bare main chune or chust nahin hona chahie
 Piku is secretly happy but does not make much sense
 agle din, har koi pataa chalata he ki bhokar kii neend main uski mrityu ho gai he, shaayad epane yaa cardia arithemia se so jaao
 Piku states that he always wanted a peaceful death
 vah dilli lautati he, jahaan vah apane antim sanskaar kii vyavastha karti he
 There, Bhaskar's doctor Dr
 Srivastava told him that Syed also has constipation and Bhaskar had known about it for a long time
 kuch dinon baad, vah rana kaa bhugtan karne ke liye jo bhi dey karti he, vah bhugtan karti he
 He named Delhi's home "bhaskar Villa" in memory of his father and the maid, who left due to Bhashkor's tantrums, returned to work

 If such a person is punished, it does not improve him, but it makes his mental gland even more complicated
 aise apradhi ke upachaar ke liye maansik chikitsak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Modern psychology has told us that tightening of the punishments is not enough to reduce crime in society
 iske liye samaaj main sushiksha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 The anti-social work is the proper approach to the person

 Till these permanent expressions become a part of human nature, they do not give the ability to stop human from misconduct
 aise vidvan log aparaadh karte hai or unke liye swayan ko koste bhi hai
 This increases their mental confusion

 Their reforms cannot be done by ordinary criminal law

 In order to improve such people, it is necessary that education should not lead to livelihood or to achieve practicality, but to the overall development of human personality ie intellectual and emotional development
 jab manushya dusron ke hit main apana hit dekhne lagata he or is sujh ke anusaar aacharan karne kii kshamta praapt kar letaa he tabhi vah samaaj kaa suyogy naagarik hota he

 In order to improve it, one has to make habit in the beginning to experience happiness in the happiness of others

 One day in the court of Vikram, a scholar from a state of South India intended that betrayal is the lowest of the world
 usne raja ko apana vichaar spasht karne ke liye ek katha sunai
 He said- There was a king in Aryava long time ago
 uskaa bharaa-puraa parivaar tha, phir bhi sattar varsh kii aayu main usne ek rupavati kanya se vivaah kiya
 He was so fascinated by the appearance of the new queen that he did not feel like being separated from her for even a moment
 vah chahta tha ki har vaiikhat uskaa cheharaa uske saamne rahe
 He also placed the new queen in the court next to him
 uske saamne koi bhi kuch bolne kaa saahas nahin karata, magar uske peeth peeche sab uskaa uphaas karte
 Chief minister of the king felt bad about it
 usne ekant main raja se kaha ki sab uski is kii aalochana karte hai
 If he wants to keep looking at the face of the new queen every moment, then make a good picture of it and have it placed in front of the throne
 chunki is rajya main raja ke akele baithne kii parampara rahi he, isliye uskaa rani ko darbar main apane saath laana ashobhaneey he
 The great king was like a friend from a young age and the king took everything seriously
 usne mahamantri se kisi achche chitrakaar ko choti rani ke chitra ko banane kaa kaam saunpane ko kahi
 The Great Minister called a highly qualified painter
 chitrakaar ne rani kaa chitra bananaa shuru kar diya
 When the court came as a painting, everyone became a fan of the painter
 baarik se baarik chiz ko bhi chitrakaar ne us chitra main utaar diya tha
 The picture was as lively as if the little queen would speak at any moment
 raja ko bhi chitra bahut pasand aayaa
 At that point, she saw the queen's thigh made by the painter, on which the painter had shown a mole with great precision
 raja ko shankaa hui ki rani ke gupt ang bhi chitrakaar ne dekhe hai or krodhit hokar usne chitrakaar se sachai bataane ko kaha
 The painter tried to convince him with decency that nature gave him a microscopic vision, so that he also knew what was hidden
 til usee kaa ek pramaan he or usne til ko khubsuurati badhaane ke liye dikhaane kii koshish kii he
 The king could not believe his words at all
 usne jallaadon ko bulaakar tatkaal ghaney jangal main jaakar uski gardan uda dene kaa hukum diya tathaa kaha ki uski ankhen nikaalkar darbar main uske saamne pesh karen
 The great minister knew that the words of the painter were true
 usne raste main un jallaadon ko dhan kaa lobh dekar chitrakaar ko mukt karvaa liya tathaa unhen kisi hiran ko markar uski aankhe nikaal lene ko kaha taaki raja ke vishwaas ho jaae ki kalakaar ko khatm kar diya gaya he
 The great minister brought the painter to his building and stayed with him as a painter 
 kuch dinon baad raja kaa putr shikaar khilne gaya, to ek sher uske peeche pad gaya
 The prince climbed a tree to save his life
 tabhi uski nazar ped par pehle se maujuud ek bhaaluu par padi
 When he was afraid of the bear, the bear asked him to be relaxed
 bhaaluu ne kaha ki vah bhi usee kii tarah sher se darkar ped par chadha hua he or sher ke jane kii pratiksha kar rahaa he
 The lion was hungry and sat under the tree with eyes on both of them
 rajkumaar ko baithe-baithe neend aane lagi or jage rahanaa use mushkil dikh padaa
 The bear called him to his side and asked him to sleep for a while on a thick branch
 bhaaluu ne kaha ki jab vah sokar uth jayega to vah jagakar rakhwali karegaa or bhaaluu soyega jab rajkumaar so gaya to sher ne bhaaluu ko phuslane kii koshish kii
 He said that he and the bear are wild animals, so both should think of each other well
 manushya kabhi bhi vanya praaniyon kaa dost nahin ho saktaa
 He asks the bear to drop the prince so that he can make him his grass
 magar bhaaluu ne uski baat nahin maani tathaa kaha ki vah vishwasghaat nahin kar saktaa
 The lion was left broken hearted
 chaar ghanton kii neend puri karne ke baad jab rajkumaar jaagaa, to bhaaluu kii baari ai or vah so gaya
 The lion tried to woo the prince now
 usne kaha ki kyon vah bhaaluu ke liye dukh bhoga rahaa he
 If he casts the bear, the lion's appetite will disappear and he will return to the palace comfortably
 rajkumaar uski baton main aa gaya
 He tried to topple the bear by pushing it
 magar bhaaluu na jane kaise jaag gaya or rajkumaar ko vishwasghaatee kahkar khub dhikkara
 The prince's conscience whipped him so much that he became dumb
 jab sher bhukh ke maare jangal main anya shikaar kii khoj main nikal gaya to vah rajmahal pahunchaa
 No one understood the fact of his being dumb
 kai bade vaidya aae, magar rajkumaar kaa rog kisi kii samaj main nahin aayaa
 Finally, hiding in Mahamantri's house, he took the form of artist Vaidya and came to the prince
 usne gunge rajkumaar ke chehre kaa bhav padhakar sab kuch jaan liya
 When he asked the prince in the language of the sign whether he had lost his voice after suffering self-aggression, the prince wept bitterly
 rone se us par manovaigyanik asar padaa or uski khoi vaani laut ai
 The king was surprised how he found out the truth by looking at the prince's face, and the painter replied that the way the artist saw the mole of his queen's thigh
 raja turant samaj gaya ki vah vahi kalakaar tha jiske vadh kii usne ajna di thi
 He started apologizing to the painter for his mistake and honored him with a lot of reward

 May Allah love him who loves Hussein
 " Mu'awiya fought for Khilafat with Ali A
 ali ke baad unke jyeshtha putr hasam0 ko khaliph bananaa tha
 Muawiya did not like this
 wo hasan alehisslam se sangharsh kar khilaafat kii gaddi chahta tha
 Hasan Alaihisslam ruled Mu'awiya on the condition that he would not accept the subjugation of Mu'awiya
 lekin itane par bhi muavia prasann nahin rahaa or antat usne hasan alehisslam ko zehar pilwakar shahid kar daalaa
 Observing the events that took place for ten years after his martyrdom in fifty Hijri, he was opposed to Muawiya
 jab san saath hijri main muavia kaa dehant ho gaya, va uske bete yajid ne gaddi par baithne ke baad hazarat imam hossain alaihissalam se bchaat karne ke liye kaha, to aapane bchaat karne se manaa kar diya

 muavia se hui sandhi ke mutabik,muavia ke marane baad hasan alehisslam ke paas phir unke chote bhai hossain alehisslam khaliph banenge par muavia ko ye bhi pasand nahin aayaa
 He refused to hand over Hussain Alaihismalam
 iske das saal kii avadhi ke aakhri 6 maheene pehle muavia kii mrityu ho gai
 According to the condition, no child of Mu'awiya would be entitled to Khilafat, yet he made his son Yazid i Khalifa and began to seek imprisonment from Imam Hussain Alaihissalam, to which Hussein Alaihismalam said "like me you can never do anything"

 or pesh hai nohe kii kuch panktiyaan jo muharram ke maheene main padhi or padhai jaati hai Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last emperor of the Mughal Empire in India and a noted poet of Urdu
 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana
 This order shows how big he was for hindu-muslim unity
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the
 According to literary critics, during the time of Zafar, where Mughal power was in decline, Urdu literature especially Urdu poetry was at its height

 In this revolution, between 1775 and 1783, thirteen colonies joined the armed struggle with the British Empire
 is sangram ko 'krantikari yuddh' yaa 'america kaa swatantrata sangram' kehete hai
 As a result of this revolution, America's independence was declared in 1776 and finally in October of 1781, the revolutionaries won the battlefield
