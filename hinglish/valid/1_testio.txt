 12 veen loksabhaa keval 413 din chali, jo us tithi tak kaa sabase kam samay tha

 Their rivalry became more evident only in the personal confrontation between Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vajpayee

 This led to an internal crisis in the Congress and the BJP effectively used it as an electoral issue

 Based on the moderate to political expansion of strong and extensive alliances with other parties, the BJP and its allies continued to grow in the 1991, 1996 and 1998 elections; And due to territorial expansion, the NDA became competitive and even got the highest number of votes in Congress-dominated areas like Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Assam
 ye kaarak 1999 ke chunaav parinaamon main nirnaayak sabit hue
 In the result that came on 6 October, the NDA got 298 seats, Congress and its allies got 136 seats
 vaajapeyi ne 13 oktober ko pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath lee
 The bjp-led NDA government completed five years of its rule under the supervision of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2004 and four-phase elections were held between April 20 and May 10, 2004

 The economy had shown steady growth during the BJP rule and disinvestment of public sector undertakings was put on track

 The service sector also generated many jobs available

 The quarrel between the BJP and its allies was on one side and that of the Congress and its allies on the other
 haalanki, kshetreey matbhed rashtriya paridrishy par ubhare the
 The BJP contested as a member of the NDA, though its agreement on seat sharing was also with some strong regional parties outside the NDA such as the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party in Tamil Nadu
 congress ke netritv main rashtriya str kaa vipakshi morcha banane kii koshish bhi hui
 In the end, no agreement was reached, but at the regional level, there was an alliance of Congress and regional parties in several states
 yah pehali baar tha ki congress ne sansadeey chunaavon main is tarah ke gathbandhan ke saath chunaav ladaa tha
 The Left parties, particularly the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India, contested on their own in the strongholds of West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala and faced both the Congress and the NDA

 haalanki chunaav purv bhavishyavaaniyon main bhaajapa ke liye baari bahumat kii baat kahi gai thi, lekin agsit paul main trishanku sansad kii bhavishyavaanee hui
 There is also a general perception that as soon as the BJP began to believe that the elections were not entirely in its favor, it shifted the focus of the bjp's campaign from India Shining to issues of stability
 jis congress ko bhaajapa ne "puraane bhang vaali" kaa naam diya tha use mukhyatah garibon, graminon, nichali jatiyon or alpsankhyak matadaataaon kaa baari samarthan mila jisase congress ne badi jeet hasil kii; in logon ko ek vishalkay madhyamvarg ko janm dene vaali vigat varshon kii aarthik vruddhi kaa koi vishesh laabh praapt nahin hua
 Various reasons are attributed to the defeat in pre-election predictions
 rashtriya muddon kii bajaay log apane aasapaas ke muddon, jaise pani kii kami, sookhaa, aadi, ke bare main zyada chintit the; or bhaajapa ke sahyogi satta virdohi bhaawanaaon kaa saamana kar rahe the
 On 13 May, the BJP accepted the defeat and the Congress was able to get a majority of 335 out of 543 under the help of its allies and under the guidance of Sonia Gandhi

 After leaving school, Watson took a year off for filming Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which began in February 2009 but said she "definitely wants to go to university"
 Despite countless conflicting dialogue narratives, some highly-regarded sources claim that she would 'definitely' have studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, Columbia University, Brown University or Yale University, but Watson publicly made her commitment to one institution Reluctant to express, he said that he should first announce his decision on his official website Will In a July 2009 interview with Jonathan Ross and David Letterman, she confirmed that she was planning to study Liberal Arts in the United States
 usne kaha ki - filmakan ke liye ek bachche ke rup itane saare skool se vanchit rahane ke kaaran - british vishvavidhyalayon kii apeksha use america ucch shiksha kaa "vyapak paathyakram" zyada acha lagata tha, "jahaan teen varsh ke adhyayan ke liye sirf ek vishay chunanaa padataa he"

 When an air current is passed through the orifice of the device, the flute produces a sound due to the air vibrating on the orifice

 It stimulates air in the cylindrical resonant cavity commonly present in the flute
 vadak yantra ke chhidron ko khol evam band kar ke dhwani ke swar main parivartan karata he, is prakaar yah anunaadi kii prabhavi lambaai evam iske sadrush anunaad aavriti main parivartan hota he

 So the police whistle, which is a form of a flute, is very wide in tone and therefore the pipe argon can be louder than a concert flute: a large organ pipe can hold a few cubic feet of air and Its sound holes may be somewhat wide, while the air current of a concert flute is only slightly larger than an inch
 vaayu dhara ko ek uchit kone evam veg se pravaahit karnaa chaiye anyathaa bansuri main vaayu main kampan nahin hoga

 Hinduism has evolved systematically since about 5000 years and can be seen as seven stages that binoculars are in each other
 kuch hindutv ke adhivaktaaon kaa maananaa hoga ki 12,000 saal pehle himyug ke ant tak hindu dharm ko apane sampurna rup main rishiyon ke liye prakat kiya gaya tha
 In the history of Hindutva, mythology is just history from time to time, historians cannot or cannot count
 haal ke dinon main, hindu dharm ko "khulaa strot dharm" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, anokhaa he ki isamen koi paribhaashit sansthaapak yaa siddhant nahin he, or aitihaasik or bhugolic vaastaviktaaon ke jawaab main iske vichaar lagaataar viksit hote hai
 It is best described as a river with many tributaries and branches, one of the Hindutva branches, and is currently very powerful, with many considering themselves as a river
 lagbhag 5000 saal pehle, kaansya yug main, jise ab hadappa sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaha jaataa he, jo eent shaharon kii visheshta he, jo lagbhag ek hajaar varshon se sindhu nadi ghati ke vishaal kshetra main ganga ke upar tak pahunche
 In these flat cities, we find earthen seals with images that are very much part of the current Hindu nature such as the pipal tree, the bull, the swastika, the seven maids, and a man sitting in a yoga pose
 ham is charan ke bare main bahut kuch nahin jaanate kyonki bhashaa ko samajhane ke liye bana rahata he
 3,500 years ago, in the Iron Age, Vedic hymns and rituals can be traced back to Harappan ideas, but are designed for a nomadic and rural lifestyle rather than a sustainable urban lifestyle
 kuch hindutv ke adhivaktaaon puri tarah asahmat hai or jor dete hai ki do charnon vastav main ek hai
 In this phase, we get a worldview that celebrates the physical world, where gods are introduced to rituals, and are said to provide health and wealth, prosperity and peace
 devataaon ko aamantrit karne or unase anugrah praapt karne kaa yah pahalu aaj bhi jari he, haalanki ye rasmen alag-alag hai
 The Vedas reveal a gradual spread from the Indus to the Upper Ganges and Lower Gangetic Plains
 kuch hindutv vidwaan is tarah ke bhugolic failaav kaa khandan karte hai or upmahadweep par jor dete hai ki pracheen samay se puri tarah se viksit, samroop, shahari vaidic samskruti, plastic kii surgery or yahaan tak ki hawaii jahaaj jaise unnat praudyogiki ke liye
 In the third phase, with texts known as the Upanishads 2,500 years ago, where more importance was given to introspection and meditation than rituals, and we focus more on ideas like rebirth, monasticism, liberation from the cycle of birth and death
 We do
 is charan main buddha dharm or jain dharm jaise shaman paramparaon kaa udai dekha gaya, iske anuyaayiyon ne paali or praakrit main baat kii or vedic rup or vaidic bhashaa, sanskrit kaa bhi khaarij kar diya
 It also included Brahmin priests reorganizing Vedic ideas through the creation of scriptures, books that focus on the ritual of regulating and passing social life through marriage, and the obligations of people to their ancestors, Depends on their caste and world
 vishaal
 Many academics use Brahmanism to describe this association of Vedic ideas and see it as a radically patriarchal and Magasian force that competes violently with the orders of egalitarian and pacifist monasteries
 buddha dharm or jain dharm, vaidic prathaon or vishwaason ke saath, uttar bharat se dakshin bharat tak fail gaya, or antat upmahadweep se madhya asia tak or dakshin purv asia tak fail gaya
 In the south, Tamil Sangam culture was encountered, with information that comes from a collection of early poems that reveal some knowledge of Vedic rituals and later epics with knowledge of Buddhism and Jainism
 kuch hindutv vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki koi alag tamil sangam samskruti nahin thi
 It was part of a fully developed, homogenous, urban Vedic culture, where everyone spoke Sanskrit
 chauthe charan main 2,000 saal pehle shuru hue ramayana, mahabharat or puraana jaise lekhon kaa udai hua, jahaan kahaniyon ko gharelu or vishwa sambandhon kii vishvadrushti kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he or ab parichit hindu vishvadrushti kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 We are introduced to a fully developed mythology where the world has no beginning or end, with many heavens and many hellos, controlled by action and reaction, where all societies go through cycles of birth and death Are, just like all living beings, temples and temple rituals arose in this phase
 ham mathvaasi vedantik adeshon kaa udai bhi dekhte hai jo sharir or sabakuch samvednaatmak, saath hi jaap tantrik adeshon se sharir ko bhrasht karte hai or sharir or sabhi chizon kii khoj karte hai
 We can also see the mingling of the old Nigama tradition, where divinity is considered formless with the new Agma tradition, where the divine takes the form of Shiva and his sons, Vishnu and his avatars, and the goddess and her many forms
 nae adeshon or paramparaon ke ubharne ke saath, ham jati pranali ke samekan ko bhi dekhte hai, jo vyavsaayon ke aadhaar par samudaay samooh nahin he, jo antarimari na hone se khud ko alag karata he
 Many academics have seen caste as an essential feature of Hinduism in favor of the upper castes, which it is alleged that Hindus reject
 kai hindutv ke vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati ke paas ek vaigyanik or tarksangat aadhaar he, or uske paas raajnneeti yaa arthshaastra ke saath kuch bhi nahin he
 The fifth stage is 1,000 years old, and it saw the rise of devotion as a principle, where devotees are connected to the deities through passionate songs, composed in regional languages, often bypassing the temple system
 yah vah samay tha jab ek kathor jati ke padanukram ne khud ko dridhtaapurvak lagaaya tha, jo pavitrataa ke siddhant par aadhaarit thi or kuch jatiyon ko ashubh or ayogy rup main dekha ja rahaa tha
 They too cannot be well deprived of the community
 This is also the time when Islam enters India, peacefully moves south through the merchants of the sea and violently to the north through the Central Asian chieftains, Those who destroy Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples, which are also centers of political power and eventually establish their rule, are often associated with Hindu kings Area were opposed to the Vijayanagar Empire Ahoms, Marathas and the Deccan Rajput, east to the north
 hindutv ne islam ke aagaman or dilli or dekkani sultanaton ke utthan ko dekhte hue, baad main mughal shashan ko mahaan hindu samskruti ke ant ke rup main chihnit kiya, yah ek vishay he ki marxvaadi itihaaskaaron ne pagal sampradayik prachaar kiya he
 Later only hindu-islamic cooperation was exposed, going to other extreme, non-marxist historians argue chathe charan 300 varsh kaa he jab hindu dharm upmahadweep main europea shakti ke udai ko uttar dete hai, or isai mishnariyon ke parinamswaroop aagaman or tarksangat vaigyanik vyaakhyaan
 Some Hindutva scholars do not differentiate between the two

 Some decided to reform Hinduism to look colonial
 dusron ne hindu dharm ke "sachche saar" kii khoj karne or "baad main bhrasht" prathaon ko khaarij kar diya
 Still others rejected Hinduism itself and saw all religions as a dark dangerous force, rationally and scientifically altered
 yah is charan main he ki hindutv ek javaabi shakti ke rup main ubhare jo ki unhone european main hinduon kii sabhi chizon ke avinashi or anuchit majaak ke rup main dekha or baad main america or bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon main chunauti di
 Hindutva saw Marxism and all other Western discourses as another form of Christian discourse, seeking to eradicate all traces of the Hindu way of life, what Islam had done in Central and Southeast Asia in previous centuries

 Does this make India basically a Hindu state? Or does it inspire the "idea of india" where all people get equal respect, irrespective of religion and caste? Different people will answer differently
 hindutv ne alpsankhyak anushaasanatmakataa ke rup main dharmanirpekshata ko dekha, vishisht jatiyon ke pratwaad ke rup main sakaaratmak bhedbhaav ko dekhte hue samaajwaad sirf krodhit poonjeevaad, saamaajik nyaay ke siddhanton or paaramparik hindu parivaar ke mulyon kii dhamkee dekar langik samanta kaa nirmaan, or samaan naagarik samhita kii anupasthiti ke rup main bharat ko vibhajit karne kaa ek or tarika
 Many intellectuals, when they argued that concepts like Hinduism and India, were the creation of the British, with no real ancient roots, rejected the faith of the general public as contrary to fanciful imaginations
 yah badtar ho gaya jab duniya bhar ke shikshavidon ne jatvaad ke saath hindu dharm ko samajhaate hue islam ko aatankwaad se judaa, yaa aatankwaadi mishanri gatividhi ke saath isai dharm se inkaar kar diya
 Many people failed the theory of Marxism, liberalism and secularism among the majority of Indians, most of whom are living in abject poverty
 uchit yaa nahin, peedit mahasoos hua ki hindutv ko aakraamak rup se mardaana rukh ke baavjood ek mauka dene kaa samay tha, khaskar jab se yah vikaas kii bhashaa, or aakankshaon kii baat karata tha
