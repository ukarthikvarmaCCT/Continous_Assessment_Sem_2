 According to the Human Accounting Accounting Committee of the American Accounting Association, "human resource accounting is the process of identifying human resources, measuring it in the form of data, and organizing this information to the relevant parties
 ’’ If we look at the long-term price situation of the past, one thing is universally clear that the value of every item in the world has generally increased
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad mulya suchakaankon main parivartan kii gati behad teevr hui
 This inflationary situation made the comparability of economic outcomes in the commercial world redundant

 In the present few decades, the ideology of social responsibility has emerged in business

 It has been assumed that this liability can be met by social obligation accounting, a form of accounting
 chunki vyavsaay utpaadan ke saadhan sthaneey sroton se praapt karnaa he atah paryaavaran main uske kaaran anek hanikaarak parivartan hote hai
 Under social accounting, a business can show the extent to which it has carried out social responsibilities by creating a social profit-loss account and social letter
 lekhankan kaa mul uddeshy sanstha main hit rakhane vaale aantarik tathaa bahya pakshakaron ko aavashyak suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 But what information a party needs, it depends on the nature of interest in his business
 vibhinn pakshakaron kii drushti se aavashyak lekhankan soochna kaa vivechan is prakaar he- Owners arrange funds for the running of the business, hence they want to know that they have appropriated the funds provided by them
 us kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti jaanane ke liye lekhankan suchanaaen chaahate hai
 Such information is provided from time to time by financial statements prepared from accounting records

 Therefore, the management should ensure that its subordinate employees are doing proper work or not
 is sambandh main lekhankan suchanaaen bahut sahaayak hoti hai kyonki isse prabandhak karmchaariyon ke nishpaadan kaa moolyankan kar saktaa he
 Corrective action can be taken by comparing actual performance of employees with pre-determined standards, if actual performance is not of the desired level
 vastav main lekhankan suchanaaen hi prabandh kii vittiya niti, niyojan evam niyantran kaa aadhaar hoti hai
 Appropriators include potential shareholders and long-term lenders
 inkaa hit apane viniyog kii suraksha tathaa us par paryaapt aay praapt karnaa hota he
 They therefore require accounting information to evaluate the past performance of the institution and to explore future prospects, so the employers rely on accounting information included in the financial statements for their investment decisions
 ve jis sanstha main viniyog karnaa chaahate hai, lekhankan soochnaaon ke aadhaar par us sanstha kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti kaa anumaan laga sakate hai
 Creditors include sellers of goods, bankers and other lenders
 ye rin dene se purv sanstha kii vittiya sthiti jaananaa chaahate hai tathaa is baat se aashwast hona chaahate hai ki sanstha samay par rinon kaa bhugtan kar degi
 In other words, the liquid position of the institution is satisfactory

 Various government departments and agencies like Company Law Board, Registrar of Companies, Income Tax Department, Wing Market etc
 are also interested in financial information of companies
 in agensiyon kaa uddeshy yah aashwast karnaa hota he ki company ne apane lekhon main kar, labhaansh, hris aadi ke sambandh main adhinium kii vyavasthaaon kaa paalan kiya he athwa nahin tathaa apane laabhon evam vittiya sthiti ko sahi va sachche dhang se prastut kiya he athwa nahin
 The government determines the tax payable capacity of business entities on the basis of information received from the statement of accounts
 ye suchanaaen sarkaar kii bhavi kar niti, utpaadan, mulya niyantran, anudaan, license, aayaat-niryaat niti main di jane vaali suvidhaayen aadi kaa aadhaar hoti he
 The government also requires accounting information of business entities to determine national income

 Employees are interested in the economic soundness of the institution as the payment of bonuses depends on the benefits earned

 Accounting information, which is said to mirror the financial performance of a business institution, is very valuable to researchers

 Each transaction has two aspects or parties
 khaataa-bahi main prayek paksh kaa ek khaataa banaaya jaataa he
 An account is that part of an ledger in which a collective statement of transactions made in relation to a person, goods or services is written
 is prakaar prayek khate kii sthiti kaa pataa lag jaataa he ki vah khaataa lender he tathaa dendar 
 According to the dual system it is necessary to know the classification of accounts in order to write transactions in sources
 jin khaaton kaa sambandh kisi vishesh vyakti se hota he, ve vyaktigat khate kehalaate hai
 An individual means an individual, firm, company and any other type of business entity
 duusare shabdon main, sab lendaaron tathaa dendaaron ke khate vyaktigat khate hote hai
 From this point of view, the accounts of capital and withdrawal are also personal as these transactions related to the owner of the business are written
 vyapaar ke swami ke vyaktigat khate ko puunji khaataa kaha jaataa he
 Withdrawal account is opened by the business owner to withdraw money from the business
 is prakaar aaharan khaataa bhi vyaktigat khaataa hota he
 Accounts of goods and property are called real accounts
 in khaaton ko vaastavik isliye kaha jaataa he ki inamen varnit vasteen, vishesh sampatti ke rup main vyapaar main prayog kii jaati he
 The merchant can convert his capital into money by selling them when needed
 vaastavik khate aarthik chitthey main sampatti kii tarah dikhaaye jate hai
 Such as machines, buildings, goods, machinery, furniture, cash and banks etc
 are the actual accounts
 in khaaton ko avastavik khate bhi kehete hai
 Business consists of many expenditure items, income items and profit or loss items
 in sabake liye alag-alag khate banate hai jinako ‘nammaatr’ ke khate kehete hai
 They have no tangible basis like personal or real accounts
 udhaaharan ke liye vetan, mazdooree, kamishan, byaaj ityadi ke khate nammaatr ke khate hote hai
 Each transaction has two sides
 rini yaa debit paksh or dhani yaa credit paksh
 For this reason, each account has two parts to write its account
 baayen haath kii ore bhaag ‘rini paksh’ hota he or daahine haath kii ore kaa bhaag ‘dhani paksh’ hota he
 Debit or credit to accounts - When an account is a 'lane' party in a transaction, that is, it gets debited then the accounts are debited
 debit karne kaa matlab yah he ki khate ke rini bhaag main lenden kaa lekha hoga
 Similarly, when an account is a party to a transaction, that is, someone gains something from it, then that account is credited
 arthath us khate ke credit bhaag main lenden kaa lekha kiya jayega
 In this transaction one account and another account are credited in this way
 debit khate main debit kii ore lekha tathaa credit khate main credit kii ore lekha hota he
 Credit and debit accounting is done for every transaction according to double account system
 udhaaharan - yadi hamane mohan se 100 rupaye kaa maal kharida he to isamen do khate hue- ek maal kaa doosraa mohan kaa
 One account will be done in the account of the receiver ie goods account and the other account will be done in the account of the recipient ie Mohan
 isi kaaran is pranali ko dohare lekhe kii pranali kaha gaya he
 Each transaction has two accounts, a debit and a credit

 in anuchhedon main sarkaar ke dwaara niti-nirmaan tathaa nagarikon ke aachaar evam vyavhaar ke sambandh main ek sanvaidhanik adhikaar vidheyak shaamil he
 These articles are considered essential elements of the Constitution, which was developed by the Indian Constituent Assembly between 1947 and 1949
 mul adhikaron ko sabhi nagarikon ke buniyadi maanav adhikaar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he

 The experiences of the First World War, the unsatisfactory montague-chelmsford reforms reform of 1919 and the emerging influence of MK Gandhi in the Indian independence movement led to a remarkable change in the attitude of his leaders with regard to setting demands for civil rights
 unka dhyaan bharatiyon or angrejon ke bich samanta kaa adhikaar maangane se hat kar sabhi bharatiyon ke liye swatantraaa sunishchit karne par kendrit ho gaya

 The Constitution basically provided seven fundamental rights - right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, culture and education, right to property and right to constitutional remedies
 haalanki, sampatti ke adhikaar ko 1978 main 44wein sanshodhan dwaara samvidhan ke tritiy bhaag se hataa diya gaya tha
 The basic rights are aimed at protecting democratic principles based on individual liberty and equality of all members of society

 There is also a 950 km diameter dwarf planet named Siris, which has got round shape with its own gravitational pull
 yahan teen or 400 kimi ke vyas se bade kshudragrah paae ja chuke hai - vasta, palace or higia
 More than half of the total mass of the entire asteroid circle is contained in these four objects
 baaqi vastuon kaa akar bhinn-bhinn he - kuch to dasiyon kilometre bade hai or kuch dhul ke kan maatr hai
 As of mid-2008, five small bodies are classified as dwarf planets, with the Sirius asteroid in the circle and four sun orbits beyond Varuna - Yama, Humeya, Makemake and Aris

 Before discussing the Natya tradition, it should be clearly understood that two forms have been in vogue since the beginning of this tradition
 inamen ek to natyadharmee tathaa duusari ko lokdharmee parampara kaha jaataa he
 The author of "natyasastra", Bharatamuni, clarified these words by clarifying that the plays which are composed according to the rules of the state are called "natyadharmis" and those which are composed independently according to folk tradition The play is called "lokadharmi"
 naatak natyadharmee ho athwa lokdharmee, unka ek shailpic parivesh rahata he
 Literatureists have given importance to the object, the leader and the rasa in the craft of the play, the artists have given the rasa, bhava, abhinaya, nritya, dance and other appendages of presentation
 bharat main natya kii sudeergh parampara itani vyapak or shashakt rahi he ki 10 shatabdi se purv hi yahan kii lokdharmee natya- parampara main anek shasreey tatv bhi samahit ho chuke the
 The drama tradition of 15 hundred years beautifully coordinated the vast artistic consciousness of drama in its life and gave it a grand and lively form
 brajabhasha kii natya- parampara bhi usase achhuti nahin rah saki
 a glance at the history of this tradition shows that the tradition of Brajbhasha has been flowing in the Natyadharmi forms at the same pace
 yah kahana dushkar he ki brajabhasha- naatakon kaa shubharambh kab or kahan se hua ? uplabdh saamagree ke aadhaar par jo tathy saamne aate hai, ve bade rochak or ascharyajanak hai
 The introduction of the first theatrical forms of Brajbhasha is found in the "ankiyanatas" of Assam
 yah sarvavidit he ki 15 veen shatabdi main assam or bengal main vaishnav- bhakthi ke andolan kii teevr lahar uthi
 The devotees there praised the delectable pastimes of their favorite Lord Krishna and Radha through songs, music, dance, poetry, arrangements and plays
 naatakon main geeton kaa nibandhan brajabhasha main kiya gaya or vahaan ke naatakon kaa swarup multah geet- pradhan hi tha
 Brijbhasha's melody and Mardava impressed people so much that Brajbhasha was used in plays of Mithila region
 yah parampara vahaan aaj tak akshunn bani hui he
 Even today many villages in Darbhanga and its adjacent Tirhut Mandal belong to the congregation, who travel in different parts of the country as nomadic theatrical parties and whose plays are translated in Brajbhasha
 ye log ise brajabhasha na kahkar "bhashaa' kehete hai
 Maithil Natya - There are many plays in literature, which are still called "bhasha-natak"
 yah baat alag he ki unki brajabhasha kaa swarup aaj kii bhaanti parimarjeet nahin he
 In North India, the first article of the Brajbhasha-drama, Pranachandra finds the famous "hanumannataka"
 is naatak kii rachana us samay hui, jab khadi boli kaa log naam bhi nahin jaanate the
 After "hanumannataka", a play called Samayasara is mentioned in the drama tradition of Brajbhasha
 samvath 1643 main raja jaswantsingh ne prabodh chandroday naamak naatak kii rachana kii
 This play proved to be extremely popular
 thode hi samay main iske anek bhashaaon main rupantar kiye gaye
 In Samvat 1645, its adaptation by the Jain poet Malla became very popular
 samvath 1655 main lakkhiram dwaara karunaa bharan naamak naatak kii rachana kii gai
 It seems that this play also became very popular
 isaki anek pratiyaan anek sthanon par dekhne ko milti he
 Later, in 1686, a poet from Bharatpur composed a play called "madhav-vinod"
 is samay tak brajabhasha kaa prabhaav itnaa adhik bad chukaa tha ki rajasthan, madhyapradesh, gujarat, maharashtra, punjab tathaa vindhyas pradesh ke lekhak bhi brajabhasha ko hi sahitya srijan kaa madhyam sweekaar karne lage the
 Sri Rupa Goswami, the admirer of Bengali and Sanskrit languages, too relied on this language that he wrote a treatise in Sanskrit
 pashchaat apane ek mitra kavi se uskaa anuwaad brajabhasha main karne ko kaha
 His friend composed a play called Govind Vilas in Brajbhasha on the shadow of the book written by Sri Rupa Goswami
 iske kuch samay pashchaat hi maharaja vishwanathasingh ne "anandarghunandan' naamak naatak kii rachana kii
 In the invocation of this play, there is a mixture of words of Braj and Anglo-language, but the whole prose is of Braj Bhasha
 guru govindsingh ke naatak brajabhasha ke shashakt pramaan hai
 In Samvat 1857, Shri Gopalachandraji, the famous nobleman of Kashi, composed a play called Nahusha
 shri gopalchandraji ke suputr bhaaratendu harishchandra ne brajabhasha main shri chandravali naamak naatak kii rachana kii
 Many writers of the Bharatendu period composed beautiful plays of Brajbhasha
 shri radhacharan goswami, shri kishorilaal goswami ke tan man dhan gusaniji ke apann tathaa gopal sakha aadi naatak isi parampara ke dyotak hai
 Even Jaishankar Prasad initially used Brajbhasha in his plays
 akashwani ke dilli tathaa mathura centre se brajabhasha kii rachanaaon ko khadi boli ke yug main punah jivan pradaan kiya
 Regular broadcasting of Brajbhasha plays started from AIR and Delhi and Mathura centers
 faltah anek lekhak sakriy hue, jinhone alpavadhi main hi sahasron brajabhasha- naatakon kii rachana kii
 With this innovativeness, the content of Brajbhasha plays expanded
 isse purv brajabhasha kaa prayog adhikanshtah kavy tak simit hokar rah gaya tha
 The demand of All India Radio began to write on new topics
 thode hi samay main yug kaa naveen parivesh brajabhasha naatakon main mukhar hone laga
 The field of content expanded to new horizons, and the authors depicted all the dimensions in their plays, from Vedas to science
 brajabhasha main nae naatakakaron main sarvashree gopalprasad vyas, dow sharanbihari goswami, kaaka haathrasi, dow brajwallabh mishra, mohanswarup bhaatia, gopalprasad mudgal, dow vasant yamadagni, satyanarayan yajyavalk, ramanaresh pandeya, sushri hemlata mishra, shyamsundar "suman', ramnarayan agarwal, kailashchandra "krishna', bhagavandatt chaturvedi, sharmanlal agarwal, balmukund chaturvedi, trilokanath "brajwaal' tathaa dow vishnu chaturvedi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Brajbhasha - The second tradition of plays is one which has been prevalent in the folk at an uninterrupted pace for the last 500 years, but their plays are based on tradition rather than published in book form
 ise lokdharmee natya- parampara athwa paramparit brajabhasha natya kaha ja saktaa he
 Its plot remains intact as a performance rather than a book
 yadhyapi raasalila, nautanki, bhagat, swang, ramlila tathaa khel aadi rup braj- kshetra main prachlitan hai, tathaapi shilp or swarup kii drushti se inamen sarvaadhik pracheen tathaa kalatmak rup "raasalila' main hi dekhne ko miltaa he
 Raslila is believed to have originated from the 16th century
 ab tak lekhakon ne iske udbhav ke saath pushti- maarg ke pravartak goswami vallabhacharya, shri ghamandadevji tathaa shri narayanswami ke naamon kaa ullekh kiya he
 The author has forgotten the fact that the dance-style of Raslila is tied to the style of the erstwhile state dance and Ghamandadeva taught his children to Chaturvedi, then he himself must have received that education from his predecessor during his infancy
 
 raas kaa nrity vishuddhtah bharat ke shasreey- nrity kii puraatan parampara kaa pratirup he
 As far as the article is concerned, in the 16th century, these Acharyas may have praised it, removing its content from Sanskrit and Prakrit and harmonizing it with the verse of Ashtachapi poetry, but the Nandi used in Raslila's acting, The dance, dance, use of handicrafts, stanzas, charanis, gaitas and speech-style etc
, clearly indicate its relation to the ancient theater tradition of India
 
 raasalila kaa shailpic parivesh purnatah naatyashasreey parampara ke anusaar dikhaai detaa he
 In this, the plot is presented after "pre-rig"
 hastkon main "shikhar, dol, kapihatth, pataak, utsang tathaa mrigashirsh' kaa shasreey niyamon ke anusaar prayog kiya jaataa he
 "toxicocle", "garbhaka" and "tripati" are used in the middle of the performance
 prasanganusaar abhinay- sthal main vibhinn "sthand' nirdhaarit kar liye jate hai
 In Gantya, the words "ghan, Avandha, Sushir and Tattu 'are used by the governing verbs called" Ashravan "and" Opohan "
 abhinay main angik, vaachik, satvik or aharya kaa niyamanusaar prayog kiya jaataa he
 The most important thing in this style is - "the scriptures of law and law", the traditional dramatics in the form of gimmick and gimmick, etc
 "law aspect" is not maintained, only some parts of "scripture" Experiment is seen
 vah prayog bhi shasr se prasut na hokar raasalila' ke pradarshnon se gruhit prathit hota he, kyonki inamen shasreey maryaada kaa swarup vikrut ho gaya he
 In "raslila" the governing decorum is reflected in its Yavat form
 isamen andeh nahin ki "swang' kii parampara nautanki or bhagat kii apeksha adhik pracheen he
 "swang" is discussed in the literature of Jayasi and Kabir, the words Nautanki and Bhagat are not seen in the literature before the 19th century
 manch- shilp or prastutikaran se yah spasht It is realized that these Natya-forms are also a distorted form of some of the characteristics specified in the Sanskrit Natya-tradition
 swang kaa "ranga' patanjali krit "mahabhashya' main varnit "granthik' kii ore ingit karata he
 The then theatrical experiments used to "connect the sources of the scriptural narrative through its narration, familiarizing the audience with the characters and events
" aisa lagata he ki kuch vishesh varg ke vyaktiyon ne apana swatantra natya- pradarshan rachane ke dhyey se "swang' kii chaaya par nautanki or bhagat naamak shaileyon kii sristi kii
 As far as staging is concerned, there is no distinction between these diverse genres
 sabhi ke prastutikaran kii paddati ek jaisi he, shilp or swarup samaan he
 The first is "mangalacharan", followed by "ranga" ie "sutradhar"
 khule manch par ek ore vaadya- vadak baithte hai, duusari ore se paatr manch par pravesh karte hai
 The plot is presented with vowel and rhythm in verses called Chaubola, Lavani, Bahretabil, Savaiya, Doha, Rola and Kavitta etc
 yug ke prabhaav se kathankon main antar hota rahata he
 The narrative element of "raslila" is superior to Srimad Bhagwat, the predominance of devotion in it remains the same, while the narrative element of "bhagat" and "nautanki" has undergone many changes due to external influences
 nautanki ke adhikansh kathanak shringarmulak hote gaye, unka swarup sufi parampara ke premakhyaanakon kii bhaanti parivartit ho gaya
 In all theatrical forms, the symbolic object instructions and symbolic postures are used for stage instruments
 in natya- rupon kii prastuti khule akaash ke tale ek manch- vedi ke upar hua karti he
 The stage - three sides of the altar, sometimes around the audience - gana sit
 vedi ke sameep hi kisi band sthal main "singaar- ghar' bana liya jaataa he
 The characters dress up here and enter and depart the stage from the thin path left between the audience at the time of the role
 inaki shringaar paddati vishuddhtah bhartiya khanij tathaa vanaspatiyon par aadhaarit rahati he
 The second difference between "raslila" and the stage of Nautanki and Bhagat is that the children and members of the troupe who play in "raslila" are full of devotion, their moral conduct is a follower of a particular religious sect
 nautanki main paatro kii charitrik Modesty is not considered
 isamen kisi bhi varna kaa kalakaar bhoomika kar saktaa he
 Along with them, prostitutes can also play a role in female characters
 donon manchon ke kalakaaron ke naitik- paksh main bahut bada antar rahata he
 Its root cause is the purpose of both
 raasalila kaa uddeshy dharm- bhaavana ke prasar par aadhaarit he, nautanki or swang kaa uddeshy shringaarik bhaavana kaa prastutikaran he, lokanuranjan maatr he
 The performance of Ramlila has also started in the tradition of "rasleela" for almost a hundred years
 iskaa manch- vidhaan or shailpic parivesh swatantra na hokar "khule- rangamanch' kii paddati par hi aadhaarit he
 The story of "ramcharit Manas" by Goswami Tulsidas is presented in chronological order by dissecting it in "ramlila"
 maanas ke kathanak kaa vibhaajan aavashyaktaanusaar kar liya jaataa he
 Leela - Demonstrations can be performed from 10 days to 40 days
 usee ke anusaar katha kaa vibhaajan kar liya jaataa he
 The drama literature of Brajbhasha did not flourish within the periphery of the book, but in the courtyard of the folk, the torrents of rasa flowed as the Mandakini of the stage
 brajabhasha yadi ras kaa kalash he to uski natya- parampara rup- maadhuri kii sarita, jo apane kal- kal ninaad se lok ke hriday main anandanubhuti kaa ras pravaahit karti rahati he

 baaqi solahavin shatee ke ek prasiddh turk kavi the
 Its full name was Mahmud Abdul Baqi and its birthplace is Kustuntuniya
 yah daridr gharaane kaa vyakti tha kintu isko us samay ke prasiddh vidwaanon se shiksha grahan karne kaa avasar mila or turki ke ucch koti ke sahityakaron evam kaviyon kaa satsang bhi
 At the age of 18–19, it was counted among the famous poets of Istanbul
 san 1555 i
 main jab sultan suleman aazam iran kii chadhaai se laut aayaa, baaqi ne uske eshwarya par bada ullaspurn ek prashansaatmak kaseeda uske samaksh upasthit kiya
 Sultan was so impressed to hear this that he ordered the rest to write 'naziriya' on his poems
 is prakaar isaki pahunch darbar tathaa ucch koti ke samaaj tak sahaj main ho gai
 Due to this grace of Sultan, his own friends also started burning, but he came to be considered the greatest poet of Turkey and his fame quickly spread not only in the entire state but also to the whole of India
 sultan suleman kii vishesh krupa se baaqi ko uski nikat parshvavartita praapt ho gai thi
 Due to this, Sultan's death had a big impact on him and due to this effect he wrote a marsia in memory of Sultan, which is considered to be its best creation
 baaqi arabi tathaa farsi kaa bhi vidvan tha
 It has also translated many Arabic books into Turkish and poems in Persian
 parantu isaki sarvaadhik janpriyata turki kii kavita hi ke kaaran hui he or isko us yug ke kaviyon kii pratham shrenee hi main sthaan nahin diya gaya he, pratyut turki ke gazal gayakon kaa sirtaj bhi kaha gaya he
 Apart from the ghazals, its ode and marcia have also reached perfection through poetic vision

 Acharya Vinoba Bhave was a freedom fighter fighter, social worker and famous Gandhian leader of India
 unka mul naam vinayak narhari bhaave tha
 He is considered the national teacher of India and the spiritual successor of Mahatma Gandhi
 unhone apane jivan ke aakhri varsh ponar, maharashtra ke ashram main gujaarey
 He started the Bhoodan movement
 indira gandhi dwaara ghoshit apatkaal ko 'anushaasan parv' kehane ke kaaran ve vivaad main bhi the
 Vinoba Bhave's original name was Vinayak Narhari Bhave
 maharashtra ke konkan kshetra main ek gaanv he, gagoda
 yahaan ke chitapaavan brahman the, narhari bhaave
 ganit ke premi or vaigyanik sooyeeboojh vaale
 rasayan vigyaan main unki ruchi thi
 In those days colors had to be imported from outside
 narhari bhaave raat-din rangon kii khoj main lage rahete
 bas ek dhun thi unki ki bharat ko is maamle main aatmanirbhar banaaya ja sake
 His mother Rukmini Bai was a female student
 udaar-chitt, aathon yam bhakthi-bhav main dubi rahati
 iskaa asar unke dainik kaary par bhi padataa tha
 Had the mind gone somewhere else, sometimes the salt would have reduced in the vegetable, sometimes more
 Sometimes forget to add asafoetida to the lentils, and sometimes the lentils are served without the pot
 The whole house was filled with devotional juice
 isliye in choti-moti baton kii ore kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin jaataa tha
 Vinoba was born on 11 September 1895 in the same Satvik environment
 unka bachapan kaa naam tha vinayak
 maa unhen pyaar se vinya kahkar bulaatin
 vinoba ke alaava rukmini bai ke do or bete the: valcoba or shivaji
 vinayak se chote valcoba
 shivaji sabase chote
 vinoba naam gandhi ji ne diya tha
 According to the practice of putting 'ba' behind the name in Maharashtra
 Tukoba, Vithoba and Vinoba
 maa kaa swabhaav vinayak ne bhi paaya tha
 His mind is always absorbed in spiritual thinking
 He was not able to eat or drink
 na swaad kii khaas pahchaan thim
 Served like a mother, she would eat quietly
 Rukmini Bai's throat was very sweet
 bhajan sunate hue ve usamen dub jaatin
 gaatin to bhav-vibhor hokar, puure vaataavaran main bhakthi-salila pravaahit hone lagati
 ramayana kii chapaaiyaan ve madhur bhav se gaatin
 aisa lagata jaise maa sharada gunaguna rahi ho
 His mother Rukmini Bai was instrumental in giving Vinoba the rites of spirituality, leading her towards bhakti-vedanta, inspiring her to renounce and recluse in her childhood
 balak vinayak ko mata-pita donon ke sanskaar mili
 He received from his father the art of thinking and reasoning in mathematics, deep affection for science, scientific approach to tradition and the art of thinking away from all kinds of prejudices
 jabaki maa kii ore se mili dharm or samskruti ke prati gahan anuraag, pranimaatr ke kalyaan kii bhaavana
 jivan ke prati sakaaratmak drushtikon, sarvadharm sambhaav, sashastitv or sasamman kii kala
 aage chalakar vinoba ko gandhi ji kaa aadhyatmik uttaradhikari mana gaya
 Even today some people say this
 magar yah vinoba ke charitra kaa ekangi or ekatarfa vishleshan he
 He was a master of independent thinking, far ahead of Gandhi's 'spiritual successor'
 mukhya baat yah he ki gandhi ji ke prakhar prabhamandal ke aage unke vyaktitv kaa swatantra moolyankan ho hi nahin paaya
 Mahatma Gandhi was a political animal
 unki aadhyatmik chetana subah-shaam kii aarti or puja-paath tak simit thi
 Whereas his religious-consciousness was favorable and coordinative of his political programs
 usamen aalochana-samiksha bhav ke liye koi sthaan nahin tha
 In the matter of religion, even Vinoba had dedication and acceptance
 magar unhen jab bhi avasar mila dharm-granthon kii vyakhya unhone li se hatakar kii
 Whether it is 'gita discourse' or 'santprasad', a book written on the abuses of Sant Tukaram This gives it enough originality and ease
 yah kaary vahi kar saktaa tha jo kisi ke bhi bauddhik prabhamandal se mukt ho
 One thing is that even before Mahatma Gandhi entered into peace, Vinoba had attained spiritual height
 ashram main aanane ke baad bhi ve adhyayan-chintan ke liye niyamit samay nikaalte the
 On being impressed in his first meeting with Vinoba, Gandhi ji had said instinctively- darshanashastra unka priy vishay tha
 Within a few months of admission to the ashram, he took a year of study leave for further study of philosophy
 vinoba ke yun to do chote bhai or bhi the, magar maa kaa sarvaadhik vatsalya vinayak ko hi mila
 On an emotional level, Vinoba also found himself closer to his mother than his father
 yahi haal rukmini bai kaa tha, teenon beton main ‘vinya’ unke dil ke sarvaadhik kareeb tha
 She remained devoted to bhajan-pujan
 Effect of mother's rites
 The feeling of indifference and renunciation towards material comforts had become a part of Vinoba's character in his teens
 ghar kaa nirjan konaa unhen zyada sukun detaa
 maun unke antarman ko mukhar bana detaa
 ve ghar main rahete, parivaar main sabake bich, magar aise ki sabake saath rahete hue bhi jaise unase alag, nisprih or nirpeksh hon
 nahin to maa ke paas, unke sanndhyi main
 ‘vinya’ unke dil, unki aadhyatmik man-rachana ke adhik kareeb tha
 If there is any confusion in the mind, then it helps in solving
 Even if there is a spiritual problem, the Vinaya only works
 Even if husband Narhari Bhave also says something, the decision of Vinaya was important in that
 aisa nahin he ki vinya ekadam mukt yaa niyantran se pare tha
 The family code of conduct was also fully applicable to Vinoba
 balki vinoba ke bachapan kii ek ghatana he
 Rukmini Bai had made a rule for children that food will be available only after giving water to basil plant
 Vinya reaches home after playing outside, distraught with hunger
 On reaching mother, she would say: rukmini sone se pehle samarth guru ramdaas kii pustak ‘das bodh’ kaa pratidin adhyayan karatin
 uske baad hi ve charpai par jaatin
 balak vinya par is asar padana swaabhaavik hi tha
 They would tell him stories of saints Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Namdev and Shankaracharya
 The stories of Ramayana, Mahabharata, explain the element knowledge of Upanishads
 Sannyas used to ride on his feelings
 But instead of running away from the world, she insisted on connecting with people
 Instead of running away from the world, she would ask for change
 Often she says, 'vinya, following the house of labor well, the fathers get freedom
 ’ lekin vinya par to guru ramdaas, sant gyaneshwar or shankaracharya kaa bhoot savaar rahata
 in sabhi mahatmaon ne apni aadhyatmik tripti ke liye bahut kam aayu main apane mata-pita or ghar-parivaar kaa bahishkaar kiya tha
 They say- aise main koi or maa hoti to hill jaati
 vichaarmaatr se ro-rokar aasmaan sir par uthaa leti
 kyonki logon kii saamaanya-si pravriti ban chuki he ki tyaagi, vairaagi hona acchhee baat, mahanata kii baat, magar tabhi tak jab tyaagi or vairaagi duusare ke ghar main hon
 apane ghar main sab saadhaaran sansaarik jivan jeena chaahate hai
 But Rukmini Bai was like any other clay
 ve bade pyaar se bete ko samajhaatin— The son was trying to assimilate the mother's words that she would add further bachapan main bahut kushagra buddhi the vinoba
 ganit unka priy vishay tha
 The rites of poetry and spiritual consciousness met the mother
 unheen se jad or chetan donon ko samaan drushti se dekhne kaa bodh jaagaa
 maa bahut kam padhi-likhi thim
 But he told Vinya about his conduct about Aparigraha, Astaya
 sansar main rahete hue bhi usase nisprih-nirlypt rahanaa sikhaaya
 maa kaa hi asar tha ki vinya kavita rachate or or unhen aag ke hawaale kar dete
 duniya main jab sab kuch asthai or kshanbhangur he, kuch bhi saath nahin janaa to apni rachana se hi moh kyon paala jaae
 unki maa yah sab dekhti, sochatin, magar kuch na kahatee
 maano vinya ko bade se bade tyaag ke liye taiyaar kar rahi hon
 vinoba kii ganit kii praveenta or uske tark unke aadhyatmik vishwaas ke aade nahin aate the
 Even if there was competition between the two, the victory would be of spiritual faith
 Today those events are a historical document of mutual affection and affection of mother and son
 rukmini bai har maheene chaaval ke ek lakh dane daan karti thim
 It was not easy to count one lakh, so she would keep counting every single rice for the whole month
 Narahari Bhave smiled to see his wife laboring in counting rice
 At an early age, the eye would become afraid of weakness
 His math intelligence would have said something else
 So one day he interrupted Rukmini Bai - 'what is the need to spend time counting each and every rice like this? ek pav chaaval lo
 unki ginati kar lo
 phir usee se ek lakh chawlon kaa vajan nikaalkar taul lo
 kami na rahe, isliye ekaadh mutthi upar se daal lo
’ baat tark kii thi
 Cosmic prudence was also in it that whenever possible, time should be saved for other important tasks
 Rukmini Bai would have understood the logic of her husband
 But the mind does not agree One day after he revealed his dilemma to Vinya, he asked- bete ne sabakuch suna, sochaa
 Said, 'mother, father has reason to argue
 ganit yahi kahata he
 But counting rice for charity is not just counting
 ginati karte samay har chaaval ke saath ham na keval ishwar kaa naam lete jate hai, balki hamaara man bhi usee se judaa rahata he
 'counting rice for charity in the name of God is also a practice, where did Rukmini Bai first think
 aadhyatmaras main puri tarah dubi rahane vaali rukmini bai ko ‘vinya’ kii baaten khub bhaatin
 bete par garv ho aata tha unhen
 unhone aage bhi chawlon kii ginati karnaa na choda
 na hi is kaam se unke man kabhi nirarthakta bodh jaagaa
 This is another incident
 jo darshaati he ki vinoba kori ganitiya gananaaon main aadhyatmik tatv kaise khoj lete the
 The incident is about the time when he entered Gandhiji's ashram and was actively participating in his creative works
 ashram main subah-shaam prarthana sabhaayen hotin
 unamem upasthit hone vaale ashramavaasiyon kii niyamit ginati kii jaati
 yah jimmedaari ek kaaryakarta thi
 The incident is that one day after the prayer meeting, when that worker told the number of visitors who were present in the prayer, Vinoba quickly reacted saying - kaaryakarta ko apni ginati par vishwaas tha, isliye vah bhi apni baat par ad gaya
 Vinoba, who believed in karma, generally avoided getting into arguments
 magar us din ve bhi apni baat par ad gaye
 Disputes in the ashram were settled in Bapu's court
 gandhi ji ko apane kaaryakarta par vishwaas tha
 But knew that Vinoba was not going to get into arguments like this
 He looked at Vinoba to know the reality
 Then Vinoba said - 'the number of devotees involved in the prayer was less than what they told
 ’ ‘vah kaise?’ ‘isliye ki ek aadmi kaa to puraa dhyaan vahaan upasthit sajjanon kii ginati karne main laga tha
 Gandhiji understood Vinoba's logic
 prarthana ke kaam main hisaab-kitaab or dikhaave kii jarurat hi kya
 aage se prarthana sabha main aae logon kii ginati kaa kaam roak diya gaya
 Vinoba Aanjan was determined to remain celibate in the early stages of puberty
 vahi mahapurush unke adarsh the jinhone satya kii khoj ke liye bachapan main hi vairaygy odh liya tha
 And when you have to become celibate by taking renunciation, if you want to break away from home life, why not prepare your mind accordingly
 Why be entangled in the sweet cords of relationships, worldly temptations
 The first condition of celibacy is to prevent the mind from wandering
 Control over lusts
 kishor vinayak se kisi ne kah diya tha ki brahmacharee ko kisi vivaah ke bhoj main sammilit nahin hona chahie
 He often avoided going to such programs
 pita narhari bhaave to the hi, yadi kisi or ko hi janaa hua to chote bhai chale jate
 vinoba kaa tan durbal tha
 There was some disease since childhood
 But mind-mind is fully conscious
 It is as if all the powers of the body were confined into the mind
 The memory was unique
 kishor vinayak ne veda, upanishad ke saath-saath sant gyaneshwar, tukaraam, namdev ke saikadon pad acchhee tarah yaad kar liye the
 Geeta had memorized him since childhood
 aage chalakar chalis hajaar shloke bhi unke maanas main acchhee tarah ram gaye
 When Vinayak's elder sister's marriage was fixed, it was as if the hour of examination also came closer
 unhone tay kar liya ki vivaah ke avasar par bhoj se dur rahenge
 koi tokaa-taaki na kare, isliye unhone us din upwas rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 In the sister's marriage, the brother fasted, this was also not appropriate
 pita to sunate hi naaraaz ho gaye
 But the mother handled the matter
 unhone bete ko saadhaaran ‘daal-bhaat’ khaane ke liye raji kar liya
 Not only this, he cooked it with his own hands and gave it too
 dhooma-dham se vivaah hua
 Vinayak happily participated in it
 lekin apane liye maa dwaara khaas taur par banaae daal-bhaat se hi guzaara kiya
 This love of mother and son continued even further
 aage chalakar jab sanyas ke liye ghar choda to maa kii ek laal kinari vaali dhoti or unke puujaghar se ek muti saath le gaye
 He had presented the idol to another
 magar maa kii dhoti jahaan bhi ve jate, apane saath rakhte
 sote to sirahaane rakhkar
 jaise maa kaa aashirwad saath liye phirte hon
 sanyasi man bhi maa kii smritiyon se peechha nahin chhuta paaya tha
 The rites of mother became the foundation of Vinoba's spiritual consciousness
 unheen par unka jeevandarshan viksit hua
 Later on, the fame he earned in the field of creativity and spirituality was also the inspiration of his mother
 rukmini bai kam padhi-likhin thim
 Did not understand Sanskrit
 lekin man tha ki gita-gyaan ke liye tarasata rahata
 ek din maa ne apni kathinaayee putr ke samaksh rakh hi di— Vinoba was opposed to hypocrisy in religious rites
 maa ke nidhan ke samay bhi vinoba kaa apane pita or bhaaiyon se matbhed hua
 Vinoba was opposed to cremation in the traditional manner with the hands of the Brahmins
 lekin parivaar waalon kii jid ke aage unki ek na chali
 vinoba bhi apane siddhanton par adig the
 As a result, the mother whom he wanted most, who was his spiritual master, stayed away from his funeral
 maa ko unhone bhigi ankhon se maun vidaai di
 Later on 29 October 1947, when Vinoba's father died, he insisted on pressing the soil, instead of dedicating his body to fire, following the instructions of the Vedas that 'the soil has the right to the soil'
 tab tak vinoba sant vinoba ho chuke the
 He was blessed by Gandhiji
 isliye is baar unheen kii chali
 Mother had faith in Gita
 ve vinoba ko gita kaa marathi main anuwaad karne kaa daayitv saunpkar gai thim
 Vinoba was busy in that task
 aakhir anuwaad karm puraa hua
 The book was named - Geetai
 Geeta + i = Geetai
 In Maharashtra, 'I' means 'towards mother'; That is, the memory of the mother is associated with her nehru-gita
 Rukmini Bai was not alive to see the son's work
 magar unki yaad or abhilaashaa se judi gitai, maharashtra ke ghar-ghar main maataaon or bahanon ke kanth-swar main dhalane lagi
 His spirituality became the jewel of consciousness
 gandhi ji ne suna to anuwaad karm kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii
 For women who did not know Sanskrit, who had even half-incomplete knowledge of their language, 'geetai', composed in simple language, became a boon to drown in the spirituality of the Gita
 vinoba ko bachapan main maa se mili sanskaar yuvavastha main or bhi gadhe hote chale gaye
 Moving towards youth, Vinoba had neither forgotten Saint Dnyaneshwar nor Tukaram
 vahi unke adarsh the
 He used to sing with great enthusiasm in Saint Tukaram
 He liked to fight, quarrel with his adorable, abusive and angry, he liked very much
 The life of Saint Ramdas also inspired him
 He was neither able to forget Shankaracharya nor his retirement
 darshan unka priy vishay tha
 Ever since the Himalayas were conscious, they used to come in their dreams and they would have imagined themselves meditating in deep tendons in search of truth
 The uninhabited there, in the long, deep cauldrons covered with worms, used to incite them to become absorbed in the pursuit of supreme truth
 1915 main unhone hai skool kii pariksha paas kii
 Now what to read next The ideological duality of the father of scientific temper and mother steeped in spirituality also appeared in different streams there
 pita ne kahaμ‘french padho
’ maa boleen—‘brahman kaa betaa sanskrit na padhe, yah kaise sambhav he!’ vinoba ne un donon kaa man rakhaa
 Chose French at Inter
 sanskrit kaa adhyayan unhone nijee str par jari rakhaa
 In those days, French was the language of revolution in the field of knowledge science
 sara parivartankami sahitya usamen rachaa ja rahaa tha
 Baroda's library, on the other hand, was famous throughout the country for treasures of rare books, manuscripts
 vinoba ne us pustkaalay ko apana doosraa thikaana bana diya
 As soon as he was discharged from school, he would go to the library and drown in studies
 French literature introduced Vinoba to the ideological revolution happening in western countries
 Knowledge of Sanskrit enabled him to penetrate deeply into the Vedas and Upanishads
 gyaan kaa str badha, to uski lalak bhi badi
 magar man se himalay kaa aakarshan, sanyas kii saadh, vairagyabodh na gaya
 In those days, had to go to Mumbai for the Inter examination
 vinoba bhi tay kaarykram ke anusaar 25 march 1916 ko mumbai jane vaali railgadee main savaar hue
 us samay unka man dawandol tha
 i was confident that i would pass the Inter exam just like high school
 But what after that? Is this the goal of his life? Vinoba felt that what he wanted in his life was not possible through formal study
 vidhyalay ke praaanpatr or kaliz kii digriyaan unka abhishth nahin hai
 The train was running at its own pace
 usase sahasr guna tej bhaag rahaa tha vinoba kaa man
 aakhir jeet man kii hui
 As soon as the car reached Surat, Vinoba came down from it
 gaadi aage badi par vinoba kaa man duusari ore khinchataa chalaa gaya
 On the second platform, there was an eastbound train
 vinoba ko laga ki himalay ek baar phir unhen aamantrit kar rahaa he
 Household life or retirement
 There was a struggle in the mind for some time
 He made the decision while going through the turbulence and boarded the same car
 sanyasi apni pasandida yatra par nikal padaa
 is hakeekat se anjaan ki is baar bhi jis yatra ke liye ve thaan kar nikle hai, vah unki asli yatra nahin, sirf ek padaav he
 Escape from life is not their destiny
 unhen to lakhon-karodon bharatiyon ke jivan kii saadh, unke liye ek ummid banakar ubharna he
 Vinoba was wandering in search of Brahm, the search for truth, the practice of renunciation
 usee lakshya ke saath unhone ghar choda tha
 The journey towards the Himalayas was on
 bich main kaashi kaa padaav aayaa
 According to myths, the city of Lord Shankar
 Kashi has been the center of religious philosophy for thousands of years
 Aquarius of sages and thinkers
 a holy pilgrimage center attracting curious and knowledge-oriented people
 Even Shankaracharya could not stop himself from the temptation of traveling to Kashi
 kaashi ke ganga ghat par jahaan nae vichaar panape to vitanda bhi anginat rache jate rahe
 Vinoba was wandering on the same Ganges coast
 apane liye manzil kii talash main
 guru kii talash main jo unhen aage kaa rasta dikhaa sake
 The path to reach the goal for which he had left home
 bhatakate hue ve ek sthaan par pahunche jahaan kuch satya-sadhak shastrarth kar rahe the
 The subject was who was right in advaita and dvaita
 The question was quite old
 lagbhag baarah sau varsh pehle bhi is par nirnaayak bahes ho chuki thi
 Between Shankaracharya and Mandan Mishra
 In that historical debate, the dualist Mandan Mishra and his wife were defeated by Shankaracharya
 vahi vishay phir un satya-saadhakon ke bich aa fansaa tha
 Or say that the two sides were creating their own arguments with their arguments to cut the time
 or phir bahes ko samaapan kii ore le jate hue achaanak ghoshnaa kar di gai ki advaitavaadi kii jeet hui he
 Vinoba Chanke
 He lost his laugh- ek ore vinoba sanyas kii saadh main, satyanveshan kii lalak liye kaashi kii galiyon main, ghaaton par bhatak rahe the
 On the other hand, another curious was set out to visit India, to know India, to recognize the beats of his heartland, to establish an intimate relationship with him
 vah kuch hi maheene pehle dakshin africa se beshumaar khyaati batorkar lautaa tha
 Further, it was planned to interfere in Indian politics
 us sadhak kaa naam tha—mohandas karamchand gandhi
 apane raajnneetik guru govind ballab pant ke kehane par vah bharat kii aatma ko jaanane ke uddeshy se ek varsh ke bharat-bhraman par niklaa hua tha
 Gandhi, who later became the non-violent fighter, became the main architect of the Indian independence movement, the heartbeat of crores of Indians, dominated the Indian politics in those days

 It was made on seeing the tone of the conference
 us sammelan main gandhi ji ne aitihaasik bhaashan diya
 He said what no one could expect at that time
 vakt padane par jin raja-saamanton kii khushaamad swayan angrej bhi karte the, jinke daan par kaashi vishvavidhyalay or duusari anya sansthaaen chalaa karti thim, un raja-saamanton kii khuli aalochana karte hue gandhi ji ne kaha ki apane dhan kaa sadupyog rashtranirmaan ke liye karen
 Apply it for the welfare of the poor
 He asked them to donate all their jewelery to the wider public interest
 vah ek krantikari apil thi
 There was a panic in the meeting
 par gandhi kii muskaan usee tarah bani rahi
 The next day the newspapers were dyed with the news of that conference
 vinoba ne samachaarpatr ke madhyam se hi gandhi ji ke bare main janaa
 or unhen laga ki jis lakshya kii khoj main ve ghar se nikle hai, vah puri hui
 Vinoba Corey did not leave home in search of peace
 na ve desh ke halaat or angrejon dwaara kiye ja rahe amanviya atyaacharon se aparichit the
 But there was no way out
 bhaashan padhakar unhen laga ki is vyakti ke paas shanti bhi he or kranti bhi
 unhone vahiin se gandhi ji ke naam patr likhaa
 jawaab aayaa
 With Gandhiji's invitation
 Vinoba was waiting for him
 ve turant ahmedabad sthit cocharb ashram kii ore prasthaan kar gaye, jahaan gandhi ji kaa ashram tha
 On 7 June 1916 Vinoba met Gandhi for the first time
 uske baad to vinoba gandhi ji ke hi hokar rah gaye
 Gandhiji also recognized Vinoba's talent
 isliye pehali mulaakaat ke baad hi unki tippanee thi ki adhikansh log yahaan se kuch lene ke liye aate hai, yah pehla vyakti he, jo kuch dene ke liye aayaa he
 Recalling his first meeting after a long time, Vinoba said- gandhi or vinoba kii vah mulaakaat krantikari thi
 As soon as Gandhiji came to know that Vinoba had come without telling his parents, he wrote a letter to Vinoba's father from there that Vinoba was safe with him
 uske baad unke sambandh lagaataar pragadh hote chale gaye
 Vinoba devoted himself to Gandhiji's ashram
 adhyayan, adhyaapan, katai, kheti ke kaam se lekar saamudayik jivan tak ashram kii har gatividhi main ve aage rahete
 gandhi ji kaa yah kahana ki yah yuvak ashramavaasiyon se kuch lene nahin balki dene aayaa he, satya hota ja rahaa tha
 Vinoba, who was very young from his age, was teaching him a lesson of discipline and dutifulness
 gandhi ji kaa prabhaav teji se bad rahaa tha
 The number of workers coming to the ashram is increasing equally fast
 The Kocharb ashram started getting smaller, and the work of new ashram on the banks of Sabarmati in Ahmedabad started happening fast
 But the work of preparing non-violent soldiers of independence was not possible even from the Sabarmati Ashram alone
 gandhi vaisaa hi ashram wardha main bhi chaahate the
 There was a need for such a disciplined worker who could run the ashram in accordance with Gandhiji's ideals
 For this, Vinoba was the most suitable character and reliable of Gandhiji
 Vinoba departed for Wardha on 8 April 1923
 vahaan unhone ‘maharashtra dharm’ masik kaa sampadan shuru kiya
 In this magazine to be published in Marathi, Vinoba started writing regularly on the Upanishads and the saints of Maharashtra, which led to the beginning of the Bhakti movement in the country
 patrika ko apratyaashit lokapriyata praapt hui, kuch hi samay pashchaat usko saptahik kar dena padaa vinoba abhi tak gandhi ji ke shishy or satyagrahi ke rup main jane jate the

 Before starting his Satyagraha, Vinoba issued a statement clarifying his views

 Vinoba believed that the principle of equality should be applied in everything

 It should be eliminated from the root
 chaahe jitne bhi digbhramit ve kyon na ho, vinoba communiston ko vidhvansak nahin maanate the or unase tarkvitark karke tathaa unke lakshya ke prati sakriy sahanubhuti prakat karke vinoba unhen sahi raste par laana chaahate the
