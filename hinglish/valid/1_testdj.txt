 Aryabhata II is followed by Brahmagupta, because Brahmagupta refutes Aryabhata, who meets Aryabhatiya and not Mahasiddhanta
 mahasidhant se to prakat hota he ki brahmagupta ne aryabhatta kii jin-jin baton kaa khandan kiya he ve isamen sudhaar di gai hai
 In Kuttaka's method too, some advancement is visible from the methods of Aryabhatta I, Bhaskara i and Bahmagupta
 isliye isamen andeh nahin ki aryabhatta dwitiya brahmagupta ke baad hue hai
 Brahmagupta and Lall have not discussed much about Ayanchalan, but Aryabhatta II has given much thought to it

 The time of Manjul is 854 Shaka or 932 AD, so the time of Aryabhata should be even earlier

 bhudaan aandolan sant vinoba bhaave dwaara san 1951 main armbh kiya gaya svaichhik bhoomi sudhaar aandolan tha
 Vinoba's effort was not to redistribute the land through governmental laws, but through a movement to try it successfully
 20veen sadi ke pachaasawein dashak main bhudaan andolan ko safal banane ke liye vinoba ne gandhivadi vichaaron par chalate hue rachanaatmak kaaryon or trustiship jaise vichaaron ko prayog main laayaa
 He founded the Sarvodaya Samaj
 yah rachanaatmak kaaryakartaaon kaa akhil bhartiya sangh tha
 Its aim was to bring social change in the country in a non-violent manner
 vah 18 april 1951 kii taarikh thi, jab acharya vinoba bhaave ko jameen kaa pehla daan mila tha
 He got this land in a donation in Pochampally village in Telangana region
 yah vinoba ke usee bhudaan andolan kii shuruyaat thi, jo ab itihaas ke pannon main darj he yaa phir puraane logon kii smriti main
 Vinoba then went on footsteps and went from village to village requesting the big landowners to distribute at least one-sixth of their land in the form of Bhoodan to be distributed among the landless farmers
 tab paanch karod acre jameen daan main hasil karne kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya tha jo bharat main 30 karod acre jotane laayak jameen kaa chatha hissaa tha
 Jayaprakash Narayan, then leader of Praja Socialist Party, also joined the Bhoodan movement in 1953
 andolan ke shuruaati dinon main vinoba ne telugana kshetra ke kareeb 200 gaanvon kii yatra kii thi or unhen daan main 12,200 acre bhoomi mili
 The movement then spread to North India
 bihar or uttar pradesh main iskaa gaharaa asar dekha gaya tha
 By March 1956, more than 40 lakh acres of land had been donated as donations
 par iske baad se hi andolan kaa bal bikharata gaya
 By 1955, the coming movement took a new form
 ise ‘gramdaan’ ke rup main pahachaanaa gaya
 It meant 'the whole land of Gopal'
 gramdaan vaale gaanvon kii sari bhoomi samuhik swaamitv kii maani gai, jisapar sabon kaa baraabar kaa adhikaar tha
 It started in Orissa and was a huge success
 1960 tak desh main 4,500 se adhik gramdaan gaanv ho chuke the
 Of these, 1946 villages belonged to Orissa, while Maharashtra was second
 vahaan 603 gramdaan gaanv the
 It is said that the ideas of Gramdan succeeded in places where class distinctions did not emerge
 vah ilaaka adivaasiyon kaa hi tha
 But despite the great expectations, the force of Bhoodan and Gramdan movement weakened in the sixties
 logon kii raay main isaki rachanaatmak kshamtaaon kaa aam taur par upyog nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Out of the 45 lakh acres of land donated, by 1961, 8
72 lakh acres of land could be distributed among the poor and landless
 kaha jaataa he ki isaki kai vajahen raheen
 For example, a significant portion of the land donated was not cultivable
 kaaphi bhoomi mukademen main fansi hui thi, aadi-aadi
 Overall, these things are now forgotten
 haalanki, kabhi-kabhaar media main bhudaan main mili jameen ke babat khabaren aati rahati hai
 Acharya Vinoba's Bhoodan movement has been in the minds of the people
 jaankaron kii raay main aazaadee ke baad yah un pehali koshishon main se ek tha, jahaan rachanaatmak andolan ke madhyam se bhoomi sudhaar kii koshishen kii gai thi
 So people have made great efforts to bring this society forward
 dukh he ki vah koshish raajnneetik yaa phir shaskeey makadaajaal main funskar rah jaati he

 kashmir vivaad kashmir par adhikaar ko lekar bharat or pakistan ke bich 1947 se jari he
 On this, Pakistan attacked India three times and was defeated badly three times! In the 1971 war, India overturned and pushed the Pakistani army to Islamabad! And almost half occupied Pakistan, but after Pakistan surrendered, India returned the won land showing leniency! oktober 1947 ko jammu or kashmir ke tatkaaleen shaasha maharaja harisingh ne apni riyasat ke bharat main vilay ke liye vilay-patr par dastakhat kiye the
 Governor General Mountbatten approved it on 27 October
 vilay-patr kaa khaakaa hoobahoo vahi tha jiskaa bharat main shaamil hue anya saikadon rajavaadon ne apni-apni riyasat ko bharat main shaamil karne ke liye upyog kiya tha
 There was neither a condition nor a demand for special status for the princely state
 is vaidhanik dastavej par dastakhat hote hi samoochaa jammu or kashmir, jisamen pakistan ke avaidh kabje vaala ilaaka bhi shaamil he, bharat kaa abhinn ang ban gaya
 Now we talk about how half of Kashmir was captured
 yahaan ham baat karenge kashmir kii, jammu or ladakh kii
 There are 3 regions of this northern state of India - Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh
 durbhaagya se bhartiya rajanetaaon ne is kshetra kii bhugolic sthiti samajhe bagaiyr ise ek rajya ghoshit kar diya, kyonki ye teenon hi kshetra ek hi raja ke adheen the
 The question arises that Jammu and Ladakh have been happy with India since independence, but why Kashmir is not happy? However, experts say that only 2% Kashmiris have come in the Pakistan move at the moment, all others love India
 yah baat mahabuuba mufti apane ek intervyuu main kah chuki hai
 According to a survey conducted by researchers in London in 6 districts of the state last year, not a single person advocated standing with Pakistan, while the radical separatists in Kashmir keep advocating it from time to time as long as they are not allowed to go from there
 Keeps getting help
 vahiin se hukum aata he band or patharbaji kaa or us hukum kii tamil kii jaati he
 Terrorism, separatism, violence and riots - these are the 4 words through which Pakistan has disturbed many countries of the world
 khaskar bharat uske liye sabase ahm target he
 Why? There are many jawabs of this 'why'
 bharat ke paas koi spasht niti nahin he
 Indian politicians are also afraid of making decisions or an ostrich trend has developed in them
 ab ve aar yaa paar kii ladaai ke bare main bhi nahin soch sakate kyonki ve puure din aapas main hi ladate rahete hai, bayaanbaji karte rahete hai
 Soldiers are dying on the border, soldiers are dying in the Northeast, Indian politicians have no concern about this
 is par bhi unako raajnneeti karnaa aati he
 It is definitely said that everyone is united for the benefit of the country but it does not seem possible
 ye vichaarneey hai : baat kashmir kii he to donon hi taraf ke kashmir ke log chaahe ve musalmaan ho yaa gaiyr-muslim, jahaalat or dukhabhari jindagi ji rahe hai
 If you are having fun then separatists, terrorists and their masters
 unke bachche desh-videsh main ghoomte hai or sabhi tarah ke aishoaaraam main guzar-basar karte hai
 The situation in Indian Kashmir is many times better than Pakistani Kashmir
 paak adhikrut kashmir se kai muslim pariwaron ne aakar bharat main sharan le rakhi he
 Pakistan has ruined Kashmir on both sides
 bhutan ke 10wein hisse jitne kshetrafal vaale ‘land locd aaazaad desh’ se na bharat kaa bhala hoga, na kashmiri musalamaanon kaa
 Pakistan and China will surely do well and ultimately it will be that some part of it will be eaten by Pakistan and some will be swallowed by China
 china ne to kuch bhaag nigal hi liya he
 The fundamentalist Kashmiris do not understand this and they do not even want to understand
 ye itihaas he : 1947 ko vibhajit bharat aaazaad hua
 At that time, the work of merging Indian princely states was going on, while the tribes were being united in Pakistan
 idhar junagarh, kashmir, hyderabad or travnakor kii riyaasaten vilay main der laga rahi thim to kuch swatantra rajya chaahati thim
 This led to instability in these states
 junagarh or hyderabad kii samasya se kahin adhik jatil kashmir kaa vilay karne kii samasya thi
 Muslims were the majority in Kashmir but the number of Pandits was also not small
 kashmir kii seemaa pakistan se lagane ke kaaran samasya jatil thi atah jinna ne kashmir par kabja karne kii ek yojana par turant kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Although India and Pakistan had been divided in which the territories had also been settled, Jinnah took advantage of the situation and sent the Pakistani army to Kashmir on 22 October 1947 under the guise of tribal robbers
 vartmaan ke paak adhikrut kashmir main khun kii nadiyaan baha di gayi
 King Harisingh, the ruler of Kashmir, fearing this bloody game, returned to Jammu
 vahaan unhone bharat se sainik sahaayta kii maang kii, lekin sahaayta pahunchane main bahut der ho chuki thi
 Nehru had friendship with Jinnah
 ve yah nahin soch sakate the ki jinna aisa kuch kar baithenge
 But Jinnah did it like this
 bharat vibhaajan ke samay tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru kii dhulmul niti or adoordarshita ke kaaran kashmir kaa maamla ansulajhaa rah gaya
 If the whole of Kashmir was in Pakistan or the whole of Kashmir was in India, the circumstances would have been different
 lekin aisa ho nahin saktaa tha, kyonki kashmir par raja harisingh kaa raaj tha or unhone bahut der ke baad nirnay liya ki kashmir kaa bharat main vilay kiya jaae
 Due to this late decision, Pakistan captured almost half of Kashmir by sending tribesmen to Gilgit and Baltistan
 bhartiya sena pakistani sena ke chakke chhudaate hue, unke dwaara kabja kiye gaye kashmiri kshetra ko punah praapt karte hue teji se aage bad rahi thi ki bich main hi 31 disambar 1947 ko nehruji ne yuano se apil kii ki vah pakistan ke uttar-pashchimi luteron ko bharat par akraman karne se roke
 As a result, a cease-fire was declared between India and Pakistan on 1 January 1949
 isse pehle 1948 main pakistan ne kabailiyon ke vesh main apni sena ko bhartiya kashmir main ghusaakar samoochee ghati kabjane kaa prayaas kiya, jo asafal rahaa
 Nehruji's move to UNO led to a ceasefire and the Indian Army was tied up, which could never succeed in getting the Indian Army the remaining territory occupied by Pakistan
 aaj kashmir main aadhe kshetra main niyantran rekha he to kuch kshetra main antarrashtriya seemaa
 There is constant firing and infiltration from the international border
 iske baad pakistan ne apane sainya bal se 1965 main kashmir par kabja karne kaa prayaas kiya jiske chalate use munh kii khaani padi
 Pakistan lost in this war
 haar se tilamilaae pakistan ne bharat ke prati puure desh main nafrat failaane kaa kaary kiya or pakistan kii samoochee raajnneeti hi kashmir par aadhaarit ho gai yani ki satta chahie to kashmir ko kabjane kii baat karo
 As a result, in 1971, he again attempted to annex Kashmir
 tab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne iskaa datakar muqabla kiya or antat: pakistan kii sena ke 1 lakh sainikon ne bharat kii sena ke samaksh aatmasamarpan kar diya or ‘bangladesh’ naamak ek swatantra desh kaa janm hua
 Indira Gandhi made a big mistake here
 yadi ve chaahatin to yahaan kashmir kii samasya hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye sulajh jaati, lekin ve julfikar ali bhutto ke bahekaave main aa gayi or 1 lakh sainikon ko chhod diya gaya
 After this war, Pakistan understood that it would be difficult to defeat India in a face-to-face battle to capture Kashmir
 1971 main sharmnaak haar ke baad kabul sthit pakistan military academy main sainikon ko is haar kaa badla lene kii shapath dilaai gai or agle yuddh kii taiyaari ko anjaam diya jane laga lekin afghanistan main halaat bigadane lage
 From 1971 to 1988, Pakistan's military and hardliners were engaged in Afghanistan
 yahaan pakistan kii sena ne khud ko gorilla yuddh main majboot banaaya or yuddh ke vikalpon ke rup main nae-nae tareeke siikhe
 The same methods are now being tried on India
 pehle usne bhartiya punjab main aatankwaad shuru karne ke liye pakistani punjab main sikhon ko ‘khalistaan’ kaa sapana dikhaaya or hathiyarbaddh sikhon kaa ek sanghathan khadaa karne main madad kii
 Government of India got involved in this game of Pakistan
 swarna mandir main hue durbhagyapurna oparation blue star or uske badale kii karrwai ke rup main 31 oktober 1984 ko shrimati indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad bharat kii raajnneeti badal gai
 When an experienced and thoughtless leader Rajiv Gandhi took over the reins of the country in place of a powerful leader, his critics started saying that he has no plan and no policy
 1984 ke dangon ke dauraan unhone jo kaha, use kai logon ne khaarij kar diya
 He shifted his attention completely from Kashmir to Punjab and Sri Lanka
 indira gandhi ke baad bharat kii raah badal gai
 Due to this new game of terrorism in Punjab, Pakistan's eyes once again turned towards Muslim-majority Indian Kashmir
 usne paak adhikrut kashmir main logon ko aatank ke liye taiyaar karnaa shuru kiya
 The Afghanistan experience was beginning to work here
 tatkaaleen raashtrapati general jiya-ul-haq ne 1988 main bharat ke viruddh ‘oparation topaak’ naam se ‘war vid lo intencity’ kii yojana banaai
 Under this plan, the people of Indian Kashmir had to sow the seeds of separatism and hatred towards India and then put weapons in their hands
 kai baar munh kii khaane ke baad pakistan ne apane se zyada shaktishaalee shatru ke viruddh 90 ke dashak main ek nae tarah ke yuddh ke bare main sochna shuru kiya or antat: usne use ‘war of lo intencity’ kaa naam diya
 Actually, it is a developed form of guerrilla warfare
 bhartiya rajanetaaon ko sab kuch maaloom tha lekin phir bhi ve chup the, kyonki unhen bharat se zyada vot kii chintaa thi, gathjod kii chintaa thi, satta main bane rahane kii chintaa tha
 Due to this wavering attitude of Indian politicians, 'operation Topak' in Kashmir continued without any problem and Indian politicians continued to enjoy power by becoming ostrich
 kashmir or purvottar ko chhodkar bhartiya rajaneta sab jagah dhyaan dete rahe
 'operation Topak' reached the first to second and second to third stages
 ab unka iraadaa sirf kashmir ko hi ashaant rakhana nahin rahaa, ve jammu or ladakh main bhi sakriy hone lage
 The Pakistani army and ISI organized riots in Kashmir and after that there was a series of terrorism
 pehle charan main masjidon kii taadaad badhanaa, duusare main kashmir se gairmuslimon or shiyaon ko bhagaanaa or tisare charan main baghawat ke liye janata ko taiyaar karnaa
 Now its fourth and final phase is underway
 ab saream pakistani jhande laharaae jate hai or saream bharat kii khilaafat kii jaati he, kyonki kashmir ghati main ab gairmuslim nahin bache or na hi shiyaon kaa koi vajood he
 More than 7 lakh Kashmiri Pandits were displaced due to terrorism in Kashmir and they moved to other parts of the country including Jammu
 is dauraan hajaaron kashmiri panditon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Although there are still about 3 thousand Kashmiri Pandits living in the Kashmir Valley, but now they are able to get out of the house very rarely
 britain ke purv videsh mantri jaik straw ke anusaar kashmir vivaad or arab-israel takaraav jaisi samasyaayen britain ke aupniveshik ateet kii upaj hai
 At the time of India's independence, the British rule adopted a wavering attitude which led to this controversy
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa va saansad shanta kumaar ne kaha ki kashmir kaa vivaad desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru kii dein he
 After independence, the Pakistan Army attacked and in response, when the Indian Army attacked, the Government of India declared a ceasefire before conquering the entire Kashmir
 pakistan ke videshi maamalon or rashtriya suraksha par pradhanmantri ke salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ne kashmir vivaad ko uthaate hue donon mulkon ke bich mukhya mudda bataaya
 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif while addressing a session in the Legislative Assembly of Pak Occupied Kashmir said that until the dispute is resolved according to the ambitions of the Kashmiri people, the region will remain under the grip of 'mistrust and tension'
 1947-1948 ke bharat-pakistan yuddh, kabhi-kabhi pratham kashmir yuddh ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, bharat or pakistan ke bich kashmir ke riyasat or 1 9 47 se 1 9 48 tak jammu ke bich ladaa gaya tha
 This was the first of four indo-pakistan wars, in an effort to secure two newly independent nations Kashmir, Pakistan launched a war in Pakistan a few weeks after independence by launching a tribal Lashkar from Waziristan, which hangs in the future

 The war was initially fought by tribals from the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces and Frontier tribal areas connected to the Northwest Frontier Province
 rajya ke pravesh ke baad, bhartiya senaaon ko rajya kii rajdhani srinagar se hawa main uthaaya gaya
 Officials of British commanders initially refused entry into the conflict citing Pakistani troops to enter India

 haalanki, adhikansh tatasth moolyankan maanate hai ki bharat yuddh ke vijeta tha kyonki yah kashmir ghati, jammu or ladakh sahit lagbhag do-tihaai kashmir kaa safaltaapurvak bachaav karne main sakasham tha
 The 1965 india-pakistan war was the culmination of the skirmishes between Pakistan and India between April 1965 and September 1965
 pakistan ke oparation jibraltar ke baad yah sangharsh shuru hua, jise bhartiya shashan ke khilaaf vidroh ke liye jammu-kashmir main sena ghusaane ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 India referred to launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan

 Since the partition of British India in 1947, this war saw the largest weapon of troops in Kashmir, which was shelved only during the 2001–2002 military standoff between India and Pakistan
 adhikansh yudhpot paidal sena or bakhtarband ikaayiyon kaa virodh karte hue, vaayu sena se paryaapt samarthan ke saath, or nausena ke sanchaalan se lade gaye

 The main characters of the show are Naira and Karthik
 pehle yah sho naira ke mata-pita akshara or naitik par kendrit tha
 The story is of Naitik and Akshara, who live with the whole family in Udaipur
 yah kahani unke pati-patni banane se lekar ek achche mata-pita banane tak kii he
 In this, the story progresses even 10 years further
 kuch samay pashchaat yah kahani kuch varsh aage badhati he jab akshara ke donon bachche naksh or naira bade ho jate he
 Here the story revolves around Naksh
 isi samay naira ek galat fahmi kii vajah se apana ghar chhod detii he
 After this, the story goes on for a few years and Akshara finds her daughter and after some time Akshara dies
 or antat kahani akshara kii beti naira ke ird gird gumti he ek adarsh parivaar or pati patni ke rishton vaali ye kahani jari he
 Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai was initially the story of a young couple, Akshara and Naitik Singhania, who lived in a Marwari joint family in Udaipur
 kahani ek vivaahit jode ke rup main samaayojan ke muddon ke madhyam se, yuva bacchon ke mata-pita ke rup main, or ve ek-duusare se pyaar karnaa sikhte hai kyonki unke vistaarit parivaar paripakv hote hai
 Now the story ends on Naira and Karthik Goenka facing a similar journey as Naira's parents with a young twist
 durghatana ke baad, naitik ek coma main gir gaya
 Naksh is now 5 and does not know about his father
 naksh abhi baccha rahata he or parivaar saath main khush bhi rahata he or kabhi kabhi dukhi bhi rahata he
 One day, Naik wakes up from a coma and though Naksh does not welcome his father at first, he later accepts them in his life
 ek din sara parivaar ek yatra par jaataa he
 But during this, an accident happens with Gayatri and she dies
 ab rajasekhar se kisi se shaadi karne ke liye kaha jaataa he, or vah devayani se shaadi karata he, jo talakshuda vivaah se apane do bacchon ke saath aati he
 Akshara's daughter Naira is born, whom everyone welcomes with pomp
 baad main, bhabhima ke pati dadaji dil kaa daura padane se mrityu ho jaati he, or bhabhima apane pati kii mrityu kaa aarope akshara par lagaati he or use ghar se baahar nikal deteen he
 Akshara, Naitik, Naksh and Naira leave the house
 das saal baad naksh or naira bade ho jate hai
 Akshara and Naitik, along with their two children, Naksh and Naira, live in Cape Town
 naksh ab paripakv vayask hai or naira ek divya kishori he
 Naksh returns to Udaipur
 vah bhabhima ke man main akshara ko lekar jo galatfahami he use dur karne kii koshish karata he
 After several days, Akshara gets an apology and returns to her home, India, with her husband Naitik and both children Naksh and Naira
 iske baad kahani naksh par kendrit ho jaati he
 He falls in love with a girl named Tara, and Naksha and everyone get ready for Tara's wedding
 donon kii shaadi bhi tay ho jaati he
 Both families get ready for the wedding
 shaadi samaaroh se kuch minute pehle, tara naksh ke saath rishta tod detii he or shaadi se inkaar kar detii he
 After seven years, the show's story now focuses on Naira
 wo apni maan akshara se nafrat karte rahati he, is kaaran apane ghar se dur rishikesh main rahati he
 The story takes a new turn after Naira finds out and returns to her home
 jisamen karthik ko naira se pyaar ho jaataa he or naira ko bhi karthik acha lagata he, lekin use abhi tak iskaa ehsaas nahin hue rahata he or vahiin gaayu ko bhi karthik se pyaar ho jaataa he
 Hence, the story takes a new turn - a love triangle between Karthik, Naira and Gayu
 naira or karthik ek-duusare ke liye bhaavana rakhte hai lekin yah nahin jaanate ki yah pyaar he
 Meanwhile, Gayu falls in love with Karthik, unaware that Karthik does not love him back
 jab karthik ne naira kaa prastaav diya, to usne shuruyaat main use khaarij kar diya, lekin jab tak vah mahasoos karti he ki gaayu bhi usase pyaar karti he, to vah gaayu ke paksh main apni khushi kaa tyaag karne ke bare main sochati he
 One day Karthik tells Naira his heart, but Naira refuses
 lekin kuch hi samay baad use ehsaas hota he ki wo bhi karthik se pyaar karne lagi he
 But she also comes to know that Gayu also loves Karthik, which is why she sacrifices her love
 jab mishti se pataa chalata he ki karthik keval naira se pyaar karata he, karthik or naira ek duusare ke liye apana pyaar kabool kar lete hai
 Karthik loves only Naira, so both Naira and Karthik refuse their love
 tab gaayu baat ko samaj jaati he or apni bahan ke liye apane pyaar kaa balidaan kar detii he
 Gayu realizes that Karthik will never love her
 karthik apane parivaar ke bare main baat nahin karnaa chahta kyonki vah unase nafrat karata he
 He feels that his mother is murdered by his father and his stepmother
 karthik apane pita or sauteli maan ko pasand nahin karata kyonki unhen lagata he ki ve uski maan kii maut ke liye zimmedaar the
 For this reason, marriage does not talk to them
 usee dauraan akshara ke janmdin ke samay party kaa aayojan hota he, har koi puja ke liye jaataa he, lekin usee samay akshara kii ek car durghatana main mrityu ho jaati he
 The Singhania family blames Karthik for Akshara's death as he is found in a drunken state with his car at the accident site
 karthik kaa parivaar apane bete ko bachaane kii koshish karte hai or uskaa samarthan karaten hai
 Naira later learns that Karthik is not a criminal
 use pataa chalata he ki karthik bekasoor he or aaropee koi or he
 Naira finds Karthik innocent by finding the real culprit
 naira ke parivaar ke paksh main bahut adhik nahin hone ke baavjood karthik kaa parivaar singhania parivaar kii ore karthik kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue, naira or karthik ke rishte ko manjuuri detaa he
 The two families start preparing for Naira and Karthik's wedding
 naira ko tilak samaaroh ke liye goyanka nivas main bulaayaa jaataa he
 Just before the wedding, Karthik learns that his cousin Mansi, who hit Akshara in a car, is about to tell Naira the truth that his uncle Akhilesh convinces her not to tell him the truth and that Naira Would have told the truth shaadi se pehle karthik ko pataa chalata he ki akshara ko gaadi se takkar maarane vaali maanasi he, wo ye sachai naira ko bataane hi vaala rahata he ki uske chachaa akhilesh use naira se sachai na bataane ke liye manaa lete hai or vah karthik se kehate hai ki wo naira ko sachai bataa denge
 But Akhilesh tells Naira only that Karthik is missing his mother and is sad because of this
 karthik or naira kii shaadi ho jaati he
 The next day after the wedding, she remembers that Naira had promised Suvarna that she would keep Karthik away from Goenka's residence
 is kaaran karthik use usee din kisi alag makaan main le jaataa he
 Naira does not like it

 kisi jeev athwa padaarth main samay ke saath ikatthe hone vaale parivartanon ko vriddhavastha yaa umr kaa badhanaa kehete hai
 Aging in humans reflects a multifaceted process of physical, mental, and social change
 samay ke saath vriddhavastha ke kuch aayam badhate or failte hai, jabaki anyon main giravat aati he
 For example, response time may decrease with age while information and intelligence about world events may increase
 anusandhan se pataa chalata he ki jivan ke antim daur main bhi shaareerik, maansik or saamaajik tarakkee or vikaas kii sambhaavnaaen maujuud hoti hai
 Age is an important part of all human societies, reflecting biological changes, but it also reflects cultural and social traditions
 umr ko aam taur par purna varshon ke anusaar - or chote bacchon ke liye maheenon main mapa jaataa he
 a person's birthday is often an important event
 mote taur par duniya bhar main 1,00,000 log umr sambandhi kaarnon kii vajah se marate hai
 The definition of "aging" is somewhat unclear
 "saarvbhaumik vriddhavastha" or "sambhavya vriddhavastha" main bhed kiye ja sakate he
 Chronological aging is arguably the simplest definition of how old a person is and can be distinguished from "social aging" and "biological aging"
 "asann vriddhavastha" or "vilambit vriddhavastha" main bhi antar he
 There have been occasional differences regarding the population of elderly people
 kabhi kabhi is aabaadi kaa vibhaajan yuva bujurgon, praudh bujurgon or atyadhik buudhe bujurgon ke bich kiya jaataa he
 However, the problem with this is that chronological age is not fully aligned with functional age, meaning that two people may be of the same age but have different mental and physical abilities
 Each country, government and NGO have different methods for classifying age
 samaaj main buudhe logon kii sankhya tathaa anupaat main vruddhi ko vruddh jansankhya kehete hai
 There are three possible reasons for the aging population: immigration, long life expectancy, and low birth rates
 Old age has a significant impact on society
 yuva log sabase adhik aparaadh karte hai, ve nai praudyogikiyon ko viksit karne or apnaane or shiksha kii jarurat ke liye raajnneetik or saamaajik badlaav karne ke adhik utsuk hote hai
 Elderly people want something different from society and government rather than young people and often their social values are also different
 vruddh logon dwaara mat dene kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he or isliye kai deshon main yuvaaon ko matdaan karne kii manaahi he
 Thus, the political influence of older people is relatively high
 saarvbhaumik maanviya anubhav hone ke baavjood, vriddhavastha kaa aupchaarik vishleshan sabase pehle 1532 main mohammad ebn usoof al-haraavi dwaara apni pustak "anul hayaat" main kiya gaya tha, jise madhyakaalin chikitsa or vigyaan kii ebn sina academy dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This book is based on old age and related issues
 "anul hayaat" kii mul pandulipi 1532 main lekhak mohammad ebn yusuf al-haraavi dwaara likhi gai thi
 There are said to be 4 copies of this old manuscript in various libraries of the world
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki is duniya main vriddhavastha par yah pehla lekh he
 After matching these four copies, Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman edited and translated the manuscript in 2007
 sampadit pustak dwaara, aap jaan sakate hai ki kis prakaar ascharyajanak dhang se 500 saal pehle hi lekhak ne aahaar, paryaavaran or vriddhavastha main gharelu sthitiyon sahit sabhi prakaar ke vyavhaar or jivan style karkon par charchaa kii he
 He has also discussed the topic of which medicines can increase and decrease old age
 jeev vigyaan main, boodha hona umr badhane kii ek dasha yaa prakriya he
 Biological aging is a process in which isolated cells exhibit limited ability to divide into culture, while organism aging is called organismal aging

 These changes of the irreversible chain inevitably end in death
 kuch shodhakarta budhaape ko ek rog maan rahe hai
 Since genes influencing age have been discovered, aging is also increasingly considered to be potentially "treatable" "conditions" like other genetic "effects"
 darasal, jivan main umr kaa badhanaa na roka ja sakane vaala gun he
 Instead, it is the result of a genetic program
 kai prajatiyon main umr badhane ke bahut kam sanket mili hai, jiske sarvshereshth udhaaharan bristolakon chid jaise ped, sterjan or rockfish jaisi machhlee, kwahog or samudri anemon or jhinge jaise aksherucay jeev hai
 In humans and other animals, biologic aging has been attributed to decreasing telomeres in each cell cycle, when telomeres are too short the cells die
 isliye hefilic kii bhavishyavaanee ke anusaar, telomar kii lambaai ek "aanvik ghadi" he
 The length of the telomere is sustained by the telomere enzyme in immortalized cells
 prayogshaala main, nashwar koshika rekhaon ko unke telomar jeenon ko sakriy karke amar kiya ja saktaa he, jo sabhi koshikaon main paaya jaataa he kintu kuch vishesh prakaar kii koshikaon main hi sakriy rahata he
 Cancer cells are required to have the property of multiplying multiples without immortalization
 cancer karkon ke prati yah mahatvapurn prakriya cancer ke 85% maamalon main lagu hoti he, jisame utparivartan dwaara telomar jeenon kaa purnsakriyan hota he
 Since this mutation is rare, the telomere "clock" can be seen as a defensive mechanism against cancer
 anusandhan darshata he ki ghadi prayek koshika ke nabhik main sthit honi chahie or aisi suchanaaen milin hai ki manushya ke gunasutron ke 23wein jode ke pehle yaa chauthe gunasutron ke jeenon main dderghaayu ghadi sthit ho sakati he
 Other genes that influence the aging process have been shown to have a significant effect on the life span of the sertin gene yeast and nematode
 khamir main arees2 jin kii bahutayat isaki umr ko kaaphi had tak badha detii he
 In addition to genetic relationships to life span, it has been observed that diet in many animals affects life to a large extent
 vishesh rup se, calories ghataane se chuhon kii jivan avadhi 50% tak badhati hui dekhi gai he
 Calorie binding also affects many other organisms in addition to mice, and according to a study done by the National Institutes of Health on rhesus monkeys can increase the life span in human-like animals, however a significant increase in life span occurs only if Calorie bonding should be started from the beginning of life
 Because, at the molecular level, age is counted by the number of repeats of cells rather than time, this effect of caloric binding can be maintained by decreasing cell growth and increasing the time frame of cells to fission
 vartmaan main dawa companiyaan bhojan kii khapat ko kam kiye bina calories bandhan ke jivan avadhi badhane vaale prabhaavon kii nakal karne vaale vikalp dhund rahi hai
 In his book 'how and Why We Age', Dr
 Hayphilic mentions a paradox of the caloric bond longevity enhancement theory for humans, according to data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging that leaning leads to no longevity
 ek jaanavar ke jivan ko aksar vibhinn aayu virgon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 However, since biological changes are slow and can vary within the same species, dates have been uncontrollably determined to identify the duration of life
 neeche die gaye maanav jivan avadhi ke vibhaajan sabhi samskritiyon ke liye maanya nahin hai: Age can also be divided by decade: 13 se 19 varsh kii umr ke logon ko tin yaa tinagers bhi kaha jaataa he
 Occasional terms such as "twentysomething", "thirtysomething", etc
 are also used to describe people by decade or age
 kuch samskritiyon main umr ko vyakt karne ke chaar dhang hai: vartmaan varsh sahit yaa iske bina varshon kii gananaa dwaara
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek hi vyakti ke liye yah kaha ja saktaa he ki uski aayu bees varsh he athwa vah apane jivan ke ikkisven varsh main pravesh kar chukaa he
 The first expression is commonly used in Russian culture, the latter is limited in use: it is used in the obituary for the age of a deceased person and for the age of an adult when it is necessary to indicate that How much / how big / was she compared to him
 saanskrithik or vyaktigat darshan ke aadhaar par, vriddhavastha ko ek avaanchhneeya ghatana ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jo sundarataa ko kam karti he or vyakti ko maut ke kareeb laati he; yaa phir ise gyaan ke sanchay, astitv ke chihn or ek sammaan yogya sthiti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Numerical age is important in some cases, while many consider life stages to be more important
 purvi asian aayu gananaa pashchimi samskruti main pai jane vaale aayu gananaa se alag he
 In traditional Chinese culture, a different type of method is used to determine the normal age, in addition to the method called zhousui, called zhusui
 jhusui vidhi main, janm ke samay logon kii aayu 0 kii bajaae 1 varsh hoti he, kyonki garbhaadhan avadhi ko pehle se hi jivan kaal kii shuruyaat mana jaataa he, tathaa ek anya antar aging de he: jhusui vasant mahotsav ke dauraan apana janmdin manaate hai, jabaki shuo an kii aayu apane janmdin par badhati he

 This suggests that the impact by the older population on health care costs is not inevitable
 july 2007 tak, sanyukt rajya america main ek vishisht kaidi ke liye ek agency kii chikitsa laagat lagbhag 33 dollar prati din tak thi, jabaki buudhe kaidi ke liye yah laagat 100 dollar tak ho sakati he

 saamaajik samarthan or nijee niyantran sambhawatah do sabase mahatvapurn kaarak hai jo vayaskon ke swasthya, rugnataa or mrityu dar ke bare main bataate hai
 Other factors that may be related to the health and quality of life of the elderly include social relationships and health
 ek hi sevanivritti ghar ke vibhinn pakshon ke vyaktiyon ne kam mrityu dar jokhim or ucch satarkta kaa pradarshan kiya he or jahaan nivaasiyon kaa apane aas paas ke vaataavaran par adhik niyantran tha, vahaan swasthya kaa aatm-moolyankan kiya he, haalanki nijee niyantran kaa swasthya ke vishisht upayon par kam asar ho saktaa he

 Sewage originates from residential, institutional and commercial and industrial establishments and includes household waste fluids from toilets, bathrooms, showers, kitchens, bathrooms, etc
 which are discharged through sewage drains
 kai kshetron ke malajal main udyog or vaanijya se nikalne vaale apshisht taral padaarth bhi shaamil hote hai
 Isolation and drainage of domestic waste in the form of gray water and black water is becoming very common in today's developed world, and gray water is being used to water plants or toilets to clean them
 They are being recycled for adhikansh malajal main chhaton yaa gaadi khadi karne kii jagahon se nikalne vaale satahi jal bhi shaamil hote hai or inamen apwaahi tufaani jal bhi ho saktaa he
 Sewage drainage systems capable of handling stormwater are known as combined systems or combined sewage drains
 aisi pranaaliyon se aamtaur par parhez kiya jaataa he kyonki apni mausamipan kii vajah se ye pranaliyaan malajal prashodhan ke kaary ko jatil bana detii hai or is tarah malajal prashodhan sanyantron kii kshamta ko gata detii hai
 Due to flow variability, treatment facilities often become larger than necessary and later more expensive
 iske alaava, prashodhan sanyantr kii kshamta se adhik jal pravaah pradaan karne vaale baari tufaanon se malajal prashodhan pranali par bahut zyada prabhaav pad saktaa he jisase jal chhalkaav yaa atipravaah kii samasya utpann ho jaati he
 Under the modern sewage drain development, the trend of providing separate stormwater drainage systems for rainwater is being adopted
 chunki varsha kaa jal chaatro ke upar or jameen par bahata he, isliye yah apane saath mitti ke kan evam anya talachat, baari dhaatu, carbonic yogic, jaanwaron kaa apshisht padaarth or tel evam ongan sahit vibhinn sandooshit padaarthon ko bhi le jaataa he
 In some areas, it is necessary to undergo some level of treatment before expelling the stormwater directly into the waterways

 If these flowing materials are not removed, they will jam the pipes or adversely affect the work of sewage pumps
 Thus, the main purpose of making the filter available is to protect the pumps and other equipment from the possible damages caused by the effluents flowing into the sewage
 ise kankad kakshon se aage sthapit kiya janaa chahie
 But if the quality of the pebbles does not matter as much as in the case of land filling, then these filters can be placed after the pebble chambers
 inhen kabhi-kabhi khud kankad kakshon ke mukhya bhaag main bhi samyojit kiya ja saktaa he
 Pre-treatment may contain a sand or pebble channel or chamber where the velocity of incoming wastewater is adjusted for the deposition of sand, pebbles and stones
 in kanon ko isliye hataa diya jaataa he kyonki ye apshisht jal prashodhan centre ke pampon or anya yantric upkarnon ko kshatigrast kar sakate hai
 Pebble chambers may not be required for small sanitary sewage systems, but pebble removal is desirable in large plants
 praathmik avsaadan charan main, malajal badi-badi tankiyon se hokar bahata he jise aamtaur par "praathmik nirmalak" yaa "praathmik avsaadan tank" kehete hai
 These tanks are used for the deposition of sludge, while the oil and oil rise to the surface and are removed from the top

 This phosphorus, after being removed as a phosphate-containing sludge, can be stored in a landfill or resold for use in fertilizer
 apshisht jal ke prashodhan main keetanushodhan kaa uddeshy - paryaavaran main waapas mukt kiye jane vaale jal main sookshmjivon kii sankhya ko kaaphi had tak kam karnaa he
 The effectiveness of disinfection depends on the quality of the water being treated, the type of disinfection used, the amount of disinfection used, and other environmental variables
 matamaile jal ko prashodhit karne main kam kamyaabi milegi kyonki thos padaarth jeevon ko, khaas taur par parabangnee prakaash se, dhank sakate hai, yaa yadi inase sampark karne kii aavriti kam ho
 In general, low contact frequency, low volume and high flow are all factors that inhibit effective disinfection
 keetanushodhan ke aam tareekon main shaamil hai - ozone, chlorine, parabangnee prakaash, yaa sodium hypochlorit
 peya jal ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale chlormin ke satatya kii vajah se chlormin kaa istemaal apshisht jal prashodhan main nahin kiya jaataa he
 Chlorination remains the most common form of wastewater disinfection in North America because of its low cost and long-term history of effectiveness
 iskaa ek nuksaan yah he ki avshisht carbonic padaarth ke chlorinikaran se chlorine yukt carbonic yogic utpann ho sakate hai jo cancerkari yaa paryaavaran ke hanikaarak ho sakate hai
 Residual chlorine or chloramine may also have the ability to chlorinate organic materials in natural aquatic environments
 iske alaava, chunki avshisht chlorine jaleey prajatiyon ke liye vishaiylla hota he, isliye prashodhit gande jal ko rasinic drushti se chlorinviheen kar dena chahie, jisase prashodhan kii jatilta or laagat bad jaati he
 Ultraviolet light may be used in place of chlorine, iodine, or other chemicals
 rasayanon kaa istemaal na hone kii vajah se prashodhit jal kaa baad main upbhog karne vaale jeevon par koi vipareet prabhaav nahin padataa he, jabaki anya tareekon ke saath kuch or maamla saamne aa saktaa he
 Due to UV radiation, the genetic structure of bacteria, viruses and other microbes are damaged, causing their reproductive power to be lost
 yuvi keetanushodhan ke pramukh nuksaan yah hai ki lamp ke rakrakhaav or pratisthaapan kii baar-baar jarurat padati he or yah sunishchit karne ke liye atyadhik prashodhit utpravahee padaarth kii aavashyaktaa padati he ki lakshyit sookshjeev yuvi vikiran se bache nahin hai 
 In the UK, light is becoming the most common means of disinfection due to concerns about the effect of chlorine in residual organic matter in wastewater and chlorination of organic materials in receiving water
 edmonton or calgary, alberta or calovna, british colombia, canada bhi apane utpravahee jal keetanushodhan ke liye yuvi prakaash kaa istemaal karte hai
 Ozone O3 is produced when oxygen O2 passes through a high voltage potential that engages and transforms into the third atom of oxygen that produces O3
 ozone bahut asthir or pratikriyasheel hota he or yah sampark main aane vaale adhikansh carbonic padaarthon ko oxykrut kar detaa he, jisase kai rogajanak sookshmjeev nasht ho jate hai
 Ozone is considered to be safer than chlorine because unlike chlorine that is stored on site, ozone is produced on-site as needed
 chlorinikaran kii tulana main ozonikaran main kam keetanushodhan upotpaada utpann hote hai
 One disadvantage of ozone disinfection is that ozone-generating equipment costs more and requires specialized operators
 malajal prashodhan se utsarjit hone vaala durgandh aam taur par ek avayaviya yaa "septic" sthiti kaa ek sanket he
 In the initial stages of processing, smelly gases, most commonly hydrogen sulfide, are produced
 shahari kshetron main bade-bade prasanskaran sanyantron main in durgandhon ko aksar carbon riector, jaev-chikani mitti vaale ek sampark media, chlorine kii kam maatra se, yaa apriy gaison ko jeev vigyaan ke anusaar niyantrit or chayapachay dwaara utpann karne ke liye taral padaarthon ko parisancharit karke prashodhit kiya jaataa he
 Other methods of deodorant control include adding iron salts, hydrogen peroxide, calcium nitrate, etc
 to manage hydrogen sulfide levels

 One type of system that combines secondary treatment and disposal is a sorted batch reactor
 aamtaur par, utprerit keechad ko aprishkrut aagat malajal ke saath mishrit kar diya jaataa he or phir ise mishrit or vaatit kar diya jaataa he
 For the main work, the mud part seated in the bottom is washed away and aerated before it is returned
 esabiar sanyantron ko ab duniya ke kai hisson main sthapit kiya ja rahaa he
 The only disadvantage of SBR processing is that it requires a precise control of timing, mixing and aeration
 is parishuddhta ko aam taur par sensoron se jude computer niyantranon se hasil kiya jaataa he
 Such a complex and fragile system is unsuitable for places that may be improbably controlled, poorly maintained, or where the power supply is intermittent
 package sanyantron ko ucch aaweshit yaa nimna aaweshit ke rup main sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he
 It refers to the way in which biological weights are processed
 ucch aaweshit pranaaliyon main, jaivik charan ko ek ucch carbonic bhaar evam sanyukt floke ke saath prastut kiya jaataa he or uske baad carbonic padaarth ko ek nae bhaar ke saath phir se aaweshit karne se pehle ise kuch ghanton tak oxijnikrut kiya jaataa he
 The low-charged system involves a low organic load in the organic phase and is combined with a cave for a long time
 ek apshisht jal prashodhan prakriya main ekatra kiye gaye keechad ko prashodhit karke ek surakshit evam prabhavi tareeke se nishkasit kar dena chahie
 The purpose of decomposition is to reduce the amount of organic matter and the number of disease-causing microbes present in solids
 sabase aam prashodhan vikalpon main avayaviya apghaton, viviya apghaton or khaad nirmaan shaamil he
 Although incineration is also used to a lesser extent
 keechad prashodhan utpann thos padaarthon kii maatra or anya sthaan-vishesh paristhitiyon par nirbhar karata he
 Composting is most often implemented for small scale plants with pneumatic decomposition for medium-sized operations and anaerobic decomposition for long-term operations
 avayaviya apghaton ek jeevanvik prakriya he jo oxigen kii anupasthiti main kiya jaataa he
 This process may be either thermophilic decomposition, in which sludge is fermented in tanks at a temperature of 55 ° C, or a process may be mesophilic decomposition, in which sludge is fermented at a temperature of about 36 ° C
 haalanki iskaa pratidhaaran samay bahut kam hota he, thermophilic apghaton, keechad ko garm karne ke liye urja ke khapat kii drushti se adhik mahangaa hota he
 Anaerobic decomposition is the most common treatment of household sewage in septic tanks, which typically retain sewage from one day to two days and B

 septic tank main 'viviya prashodhan ikai' ko sthapit karke avayaviya evam viviya prashodhan ke ek sangyojan ke saath is katautee main vruddhi kii ja sakati he
 a key feature of anaerobic decomposition is the production of bio-gas, which can be used to generate electricity in generators and / or to heat boilers
 viviya apghaton oxigen kii upasthiti main hone vaali ek jeevanvik prakriya he
 Under pneumatic conditions, the bacterium rapidly consumes organic materials and converts it into carbon dioxide
 viviya apghaton ke liye sanchaalan kharch bahut zyada hota he kyonki blower, pump or motaron dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale urja ke liye is prakriya main oxigen kii jarurat padati he
 However, it is no longer used since the advent of stone fiber filter technology using natural air currents for oxygenation
 keechad ko oxikrut karne ke liye visarak pranaaliyon yaa jet vaatakon kaa istemaal karke bhi is viviya apghaton kii kriya ko puraa kiya ja saktaa he
 Composting is also a pneumatic process in which sludge is mixed with sources of carbon, such as sawdust, sawdust, or a piece of wood
 oxigen kii upasthiti main, jeevanu apshisht jal ke thos padaarthon or milaae gaye carbon strot donon kaa apghaton karata he or aisa karte samay bahut badi maatra main ooshmaa utpann karata he
 The incineration process of sludge is rarely used because of the supplementary fuel and air emission concerns required to burn sludge with low thermal properties and vaporize residual water

 Typically, it is thickened to reduce the amount of sludge to be taken away from the location for removal
 aisi koi prakriya nahin he jo jaev thos padaarthon ken nishkasana kii jarurat ko poorti tarah se khatm kar sake
 However, an additional step is being taken in some cities to contain too much nitrogen and other organic matter to overheat the sludge and convert it into small granular grains

 This expelled fluid, called centrate, is usually re-treated in the wastewater treatment process
 shesh padaarth ko "kek" kaha jaataa he jise kai companiyaan kam daam par kharid leti hai or ise urvarak gutikaaon main roopantarit kar detii hai
 The product is then sold to local farmers and tilled farms as a soil amendment or fertilizer, requiring less space to expel the sludge in landfill areas
 ek apshisht jal prashodhan sanyantr main kai prakriyaaon ko paryaavaran main hone vaali prakritik prashodhan prakriyaaon kii nakal karne ke liye banaaya jaataa he, chaahe vah paryaavaran ek prakritik jal nikaay ho yaa jameen

 However, recent evidence has shown that if the water is re-used as drinking water, the hormones found in very small amounts in the wastewater and mimicking the hormones in their functions Specific contaminants, including synthetic materials such as phthalate, can have an unexpectedly adverse effect on the natural world and possibly mankind
 america or europi sangh main, kaanoon ke tahat paryaavaran main apshisht jal ke aniyantrit nishkasana kii anumati nahin he or kathor jal gunvattta aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karnaa padataa he
 In the coming decades, increasing uncontrolled removal of wastewater within the developing countries will become a major threat
 duniya bhar main prashodhit kiye jane vaale naaliyon main sangrahit apshisht jal kii bhagidaari par kuch vishwasaneey aankaden aaj bhi maujuud hai
 In many developing countries, most domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged without treatment or only after primary treatment

 gorakh dhandha shabd guru gorakhnath ke abodhgamy karnaamon kii vajah se prachlan main aayaa tha, jo tantra ke gyaata the
 Nowadays, very confusing topics, problems etc
 are called Gorakh business such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's famous qawwali - "tum ik Gorakhdhandha 


" - in which he tells the Kalam of different saints and poets Citing this, we conclude that God / God is an incomprehensible puzzle
 lekin aajkal media main saamanytah kisi bhi bure kaary jaise milawat, dhokhaa-dhadi, chal-kapat, chori-chhipe bhrasht kaaryon ke liye yah shabd prayog hota he
 However, if we look at the history of this word, "gorakh-dhandha" is a spiritual mantra used in Nath, Yogi, Jogi, dharma-sadhana, and is associated with the religious spirit of nath-matanayus
 aisi manyata he ki guru gorakhnath ji ne us param satya ko paane ke liye kai vidhiyon kii talash kii va sadhana kii vyavastha banaai
 Dr
 Pitambar Dutt Barathwal compiled and edited Gorakhnath's works which were published under the name 'gorakh Bani'
 dow badthwaal kii khoj main kam se kam 40 pustakon kaa pataa chalaa tha, jinhen gorakhnath-rachit bataaya jaataa he

 unhone itani vidhiyaan deen ki log ulajh gayi kii koun-si thik, koun-si galat, koun-si karen, koun-si choden
 This confusion reached the extent that people started getting frustrated and the word Gorakh-dhanda came into vogue
 jo samaj main naa aa sake wo gorakh-dhandha he
 Over time, the misuse of these methods also started tricking the religious people by people of negative tendency, due to which the word became negative over time

 Devendranath Thakur was a Hindu philosopher, Brahmasamaji and Dharma reformer
 1848 main brahm samaaj ke sansthaapakon main se ek the
 Devendranath Thakur was born in 1818 in Bengal
 inaki shiksha-diksha hindu college main hui jahaan sanshaywad kaa paath padhaayaa jaataa tha or uski prashansa hoti thi
 He was raised in immense wealth and wealth
 22 varsh kii avasthaa main inhone 'tatvabodhini sabha' sthapit kii
 Its main aim was to teach people the lesson of 'brahmadharma'
 is sabha ne moulik shastron ko jaanane tathaa vartmaan samay tak unamem kiye gaye parivartanon ke sambadh main gyaan praapt karne kaa nishchay kiya
 It created a tradition of morality
 dhire dhire devendranath kii yah sabha lokapriy hone lagi or kuch prabhaavshaalee hindu iske sadsy ban gaye
 Every week it had a meeting in which Bhagavadbhajan and discourses were held
 san 1842 main devendranath ne brahmsamaj main padaarpan kiya
 The Brahmo Samaj began to collapse after King Rammohan Roy left for England
 samaaj main prati saptaah naanaa prakaar ke log ekatrit hote the or bhajan pravachan sunakar chale jate the
 Nothing more than this
 devendranath ke brahmsamaj main aa jane se usamen nayaa jivan aa gaya
 In 1847, he introduced the Tatvabodhini Sabha with a pledge
 is pratigya main yah kaha jaataa tha ki brahmsamaj kaa prayek sadsy bure kaaryon se bachaa rahegaa, sachche hriday se bhagwaan kii puja karegaa or paariwarik prasannataa ke avasar par brahmsamaj ko kuch bhent degaa
 Devendranath was the first to sign this pledge
 brahmsamaj kii baithkon main ab bhi vedon tathaa upanishdon kaa paath hota, banglaa main koi upadesh hota tathaa sab log milakar koi banglaa mantra athwa bhajan gaate
 In the same year, Devendranath started a monthly magazine which has been labeled as 'tatvabodhini Patrika'
 samaaj kii baithkon ke liye ek bada sa sthaan uplabdh ho gaya or uski sadsysankhya badhane lagi
 Branches of Brahmasama opened up all over the place soon
 kuch navayuvakon ne brahmsamaj main pravesh kiya
 Gradually, members began to have differences among themselves on various subjects
 kuch logon kaa yah kahana tha ki vedon ko sahi margpradarshak maanane ke sambandh main kabhi unka nirikshan nahin kiya gaya
 Devendranath accepted this and sent him to Banaras in 1845 to study the four Vedas and make a copy of each Veda
 do varsh adhyayan kane ke uparaant jab ye brahman vedon kii pratilipi lekar kalakatta pahunche, in pratilipiyon kaa nirikshan kiya gaya
 There was then a long debate in this regard, at the end of which it was decided that neither the Vedas nor the Upanishads can be considered true guides in the true sense
 in granthon ke keval kuch vichaar tathaa nitivakya hi sweekaarya hai
 In 1850, Devendranath published an article titled 'brahmadharma' in Sanskrit and Bengali
 is lekh main 'eko brahm dwitiyao naasti' kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya
 All this glory is of that Brahman
 vah ajar, amar, nirgun aadi anek gunon se sampann tathaa sarvajna he
 Only by worshiping him is worldly and spiritual skill possible
 uske prati premasahit adarbhav hona tathaa uske icchaanusaar kaary karnaa hi brahm kii puja he
 The religious system propounded in 'brahmadharma' was mainly based on the Upanishads
 usamen kuch nae vichaar tathaa hindoodharm ke kuch lokapriy siddhant bhi sammilit kar liye gaye the
 a new member of the Brahmasamaj was Keshav Chandra Sen
 keshav ke kuch anuyaayiyon ne brahmavaad ke prachaar ke liye apana sara samay brahmsamaj ko arpit kar diya
 These people roamed all over Bengal and started giving their message
 keshav swayan bhi isi sambandh main madras tathaa bombai gaye
 The result of these efforts was that by the end of 1865, 54 branches of Brahmajamas were opened in Bengal, Punjab, Madras and North West Provinces
 devendranath, keshav tathaa anya navayuvakon ke is kaary se bade prasann hue
 But soon Maharishi Devendranath became dissatisfied with the progressive thoughts of Keshav Chandra Sen's widow marriage and inter-caste marriage
 is prakaar san 1865 main hi brahmsamaj main foot pad gai or usamen do vichaardhaaraen ho gayi
 Devendranath removed Keshav Chandra Sen and his companions
 isapar keshavchand ne 'bhartiya brahmsamaj' kii sthapana kii
 The society of Devendranath and his companions now began to be called 'adisamaj'
 'adisamaj' kisi bhi prakaar ke prachaarkarya tathaa samajasudhar se dur hi rahaa or akeshwarwad main vishwaas rakhata rahaa
 The reputation of Adisamaj continued for some time due to the personal influence of Devendranath Thakur
 iske baad maharishi devendranath ne samaaj ke kaary ko ek prabandhak samiti ke haath main saunp diya
 In a short time, people forgot the Adi Brahmas Samaj
