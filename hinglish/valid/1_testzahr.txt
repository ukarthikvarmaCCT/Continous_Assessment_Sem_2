 ooshmiya urja prayog karne vaale upkarnon kii dakshata maapne ke liye ooshmiya dakshata kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In other words, it can be said that how well the energy is being transferred to the device is measured by its efficiency
 saamanytah kisi bhi nikaay ke sandarbh main, upyogi output urja or input urja ke anupaat ko urja dakshata kehete hai
 When it comes to thermal energy, the thermal energy given to a device or the total energy consumed by that device is q in { \ displaystyle Q_ {in}} while its desired output, the mechanical work done by that device, is w out { \ displaystyle W_ {out}}, or q out { \ displaystyle Q_ {out}}, or both
 ham jaanate hai ki urja vaise hi nahin milti, uskaa kuch na kuch vittiya mulya hota he, atah ooshmiya dakshata kii saamaanya paribhaasha nimnlikhit he- According to the first law of thermodynamics, the output energy can never exceed the input energy
 atah Normally, the ratio of energy consumption in a device to the force produced by it can be understood in such a way that if the fuel burns in an inertial engine, it not only generates electricity by running the generator but also in the process Fuel is ignited to run the engine, due to which the heat produced with the engine is also produced as a product, the higher the heat
 Will it reduce the capacity to make electricity
 is prakaar urja kaa utpaadan kisi bhi prakaar se jalaaye gaye eendhan se kisi prakaar bhi adhik nahin ho saktaa he
 If expressed in the ratio, the thermal efficiency will be between 0% to 100%, but due to many types of inefficiencies, such as friction, heat loss, etc
, this capacity is not 100%

 This method is especially suitable for items on which very thin coating is required for preservation and where the carving, pattern and design of the characters are to be kept as they are
 isamen yahi dosha he ki choti moti vastuon par hi isse jasta chadhaaya ja saktaa he
 In this method, a light spray of melted zinc on a pre-cleaned hot steel is done with a special type of metal atomizer
 bade bade paatro par jasta chadhaane ke liye yah sugam vidhi he
 This coating does not make alloys with steel

 Psychometry is an area related to the principles and techniques of measurement of psychological quantities
 isamen gyaan, yogyataayen, soch, evam vyaktitv ke vibhinn sanghatakon aadi kaa maapan kiya jaataa he
 Psychometry is basically related to the instruments of measurement
 manomiti ke antargat do mukhya anusandhan kaary hote hai - GW Alport has presented a table of about 50 definitions of personality, of which only a few are associated with its psychological side, and these also again seem to emphasize traits such as the individual's social stimulus value and the individual's personal organization
 prachlit dharna ke anusaar "vyaktitv" shabd kaa kisi vyakti ke saamaajik uddipak mulya ke suchak ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 This means the complete effect that one person exerts on others, that is, the person acts as a stimulant for each woman and woman he comes in contact with
 kisi vyakti ke saamaajik uddipak mulya ke antargat uski daihik visheshtaayen, uski vishisht vyavahaarapaddatiyaan or taatkaalik parivesh ke prati pratikriya karne ke uske apane vishisht dhang, aadi aate hai
 While acting as a stimulant, the person also has a continuous influence on the interactions that he or she undertakes between himself and other persons
 ye parinammak shaktiyaan aise parivartan utpann karti hai jo uske apane, anya vyaktiyon or sthitiyon ke pratyakshikaran ko prabhavit karte hai
 In other words, a person sees himself from within and develops his self-determination in his inner personal nature by creating organization, that is, unity and stability
 aantaravaiyaktikta kii drushti se dekhne par vyaktitv ko saamanyatya "aatma" athwa "ahan" kehete hai
 Under this comes the intellectual, emotional structures of the person, their abilities and attitudes, interests, likes and dislikes

 Nevertheless, each of these methods has some merits and some drawbacks
 pramukh sheershak, jinke antargat in vidhiyon ko soochibaddh kiya ja saktaa he, is prakaar he : Study of cultural background; Somatic circle; Social circle; Personal circle; Expressive movements; Qualification determination; Mental test; Short life situations; Statistical analysis; Laboratory experiments; Anticipation; Thorough analysis; Model types and synthetic methods

 After examining the use of psychological tests of personality in the United States by the California Institute on Personality Assessment and Research, 62 mental tests have been cited, some of which are discussed below
 das pramukh pareekshanon main se paanch buddhipareekshan hai or chaar prakshepiy pareekshan
 The tenth test is named Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory
 yah ek manomithik takanic he jiskaa prayog vyaktitv ke naidanik prakaaron kaa varnan arthath vibhinn manovikaratmak shreniyon ke antargat rogiyon kaa nidaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Proctional tests are used to gain insight into the deepest expressions of personality, ie those personal and nature characteristics and associations inherent in a person, which do not appear in any other way
 rorsha pareekshan ek prakshepiy takanic he jo roshanai ke dhabbon ke vivechan par aadhaarit he
 It is amusing that Rorsha is clearly ahead of her other rivals both in terms of locations and behavioral dimensions using the Rorscha test
 buddhipareekshan kaa uddeshy vyakti kii un yogyataon kaa chithran karnaa hota he jo sampurna parivesh athwa uske vibhinn pakshon ke prati uske abhiyojan ko sambhav banaati hai
 Many psychologists give priority to intelligence when calculating the components of personality
 aisi samasya ke upasthit hone par, jiskaa samaadhaan kai tarah se ho saktaa he, vyakti apni buddhi kaa jis prakaar prayog karata he vah uske vyaktitv gathan ko pratibimbit karata he
 Spearman has always maintained that intelligence is a normal mental ability
 unka vishwaas tha ki samast bauddhik kaaryon main ek aadharbhoot kriya athwa kriyasamooh samaan rup se vartmaan hota he or yah ki buddhi anivaaryat: ek tarknaparak chintan he
 It is similar to a type of general "power" element that enables the intellect to behave its normal power
 phir bhi inhone kuch vishesh amoort kushaltaaon athwa "dam" tatwon ko bhi sweekaar kiya he, yadhyapi ve bahya or simit rup se "dh" tatv se hi ansh grahan karte hai
 Against this general principle of Spearman, a plausible theory of intelligence was proposed
 is siddhant ke pramukh pravarttak, keli kaa kathan he ki "kr" koi ekmaatr vastu nahin he, jaisaa use kaha jaataa he, varan is tatva ke antargat samaan yogyataon ke vishesh samooh hote hai
 For example, within its abstract field, the intellect may be a combination of particular aspects involved, such as memory, spatial relations, literal and numerical understanding, speed of understanding, etc
 yah drashtavy he ki baad ke manovaigyanikon ne bhi isi ke samaan prastaavon ke aadhaar par is pariklpana ko siddh kiya he
 Under the intellect, as it is understood by most psychologists, all those abilities come by which knowledge is acquired, held and treated in the solution of a problem
 yah pratyakshikaran, adhigam, smriti, kalpana ityadi yogyataon ko bhi upanay karti he
 But, as it is difficult to determine precisely the different types of abilities, it is essential that any definition of intelligence be so detailed that it does not have much practical significance
 phir bhi, manovaigyanikon ne kam se kam teen prakaar kii maapnapaddati kaa vikaas kiya he
 Intangible intelligence is required of professional persons, such as lawyers, physicians, literary persons and businessmen, high-attorneys, and the like
 abhiyantaa, kushal maikenic, prashikshit audyogic karmchaaree, nakshaanvis, ityadi sab ko yantric drushti se, tathaa rajanyajna, vikreta, upadeshak or paramarshdaata ko saamaajik drushti se buddhisampann hona aavashyak he
 Intangible intelligence is associated with understanding the relationship of symbols and their meaningful behavior
 in amoort yogyataon ke maapan ke liye nirmit pareekshanon ko saadharantaya "saamaanya buddhi pareekshan" kehete hai
 These tests are classified under two categories in terms of the materials used and the responses required - literal intelligence test and nonverbal intelligence
 vyakti kii buddhi kaa nirnay us suchakank ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he jo vah kisi samasya ke samaadhaan main apni shabdic yogyata, pathan or lekhan, ke prayog main praapt karata he
 Nonverbal tests present a problem in the form of pranks, labyrinths, drawings and sketches, and the test person has to present their solution by simple symbols or by manipulating it
 yantric buddhi se saamanyat:, bhashaagat pratikon kii apeksha, swayan murtt vastuon ke saath kaary karne kii ausat se adhik kshamta kaa taatpary hota he
 Individuals with the ability to manipulate and dynamically coordinate are skilled at breaking the mechanical means
 yantric abhiyogyata pareekshan unhen kehete hai jo is prakaar kii buddhi kaa moolyankan karne ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Social intelligence refers to that effective interpersonal competence relationship that facilitates the attainment of desired desires
 saamaajik buddhisampann vyakti anya vyaktiyon ke saath sucharu sambandh bana rakhane kii kala or napunya ye yukt hota he
 Other types include measures of social tendencies inherent in social intelligence by aptitude tests
 phir bhi, buddhijnya vyavhaar ke ukt teen pakshon main bhi is tarah ke paryaapt vaiyaktik vibhed hote hai or nirmit pareekshan apni seemaa main maansik yogyataon kii samast vividhta or sampannataa ko samaapt nahin kar sakate
 But under the index obtained by "tests", within the framework of today's frame of psychological research, all the field of objectively received relevant information falls
 yah upaagam siddhant kii apeksha tatwon kaa hi adhik utpaadak rahaa he or sambhavat: yahi isaki shakti hai
 Historically, interest in intelligence began at a time when the educational curriculum seemed to be a practical necessity for determining students' qualifications under an educational program
 san 1904 i main france ke public skulon main mandabuddhi baalkon ke liye vishesh kakshaon kii vyavastha sambandhi sanstutiyon kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye ek ayog gathit kiya gaya tha
 The psychologist Alfred Binay was appointed member there
 is niyukti se unhen un katipay pareekshanon ke prayog kaa avasar mila jinhen ve tathaa unke sahyogi simon viksit kar rahe the
 The main interest of these people was in the construction of a suitable medium to differentiate the normal child and the retarded child
 vaiyaktik vibhed vishyak galton ke anusandhanon ne bine kii prakkalpanaaon ke vikaas main sahaayta pahunchaai
 Binne created an intelligence test to compare individuals of different ages and different people of the same age
 pareekshan ke vikaas main dekha gaya ki aise anek kaary ho sakate hai jinhen karne main kisi avasthaa ke, jaise das varsh ke balak to samarth hote hai jab ki apekshaakrit kam umr ke balak unhen puraa karne main nishchit rup se asamarth hote hai
 If a child can do something that most children of 10 years can do, the "mental age" of that child will be considered 10 years, irrespective of the actual age of six, eight, or 14 years
 maan lijie yadi aath varsh ke ek balak kii maansik umr 10 varsh he, to use apni avasthaa ke anusaar prakhar—vastav main do varsh adhik prakhar—kaha jaayga
 On the other hand, if the actual mental age of a child of 14 years is only 10 years, then he will be called four years backward, or dull swany bine ne apane pareekshan main do baar sanshodhan kiya or unka antim pareekshan san 1911 main niklaa
 This final form of Binay's test was used by Elmandr Terman at Stanford University, where three of the Stanford tests were refined
 inamen se pratham 1916 main, doosraa 1937 main or teesraa 1959 main niklaa
 The "mental age" of Binay was scaled and it was proposed to divide the mental age of the child by his age and multiply it by 100 and get the intellect available
 is prakaar ksh
 ghr
 u 100 a g
 ri
 / k

 Therefore, the mental age of an average child is equal to his age, so the intellect achievement above 100 and below 100 will indicate mental achievement below average
 saamaanya rup se uddeshy yah rahaa he ki maanak ko is prakaar vyavasthit kar diya jaay ki kisi balak kii buddhi uplabdhi uski umr badhate rahane par bhi sthir rahe
 The Stanford Binay test is mostly used for children within the range of four to 14 years
 pramukh rup se praudhon ke maapnaarth nirmit ek pareekshan kaa naam "vectiolar bellevue maan scale" he
 Mental age is not achieved by this test but intellectual achievement is definitely known
 Its marking is prosecuted in such a way that for every level
 P

 is prakaar 50 varsh kaa ek vyakti jo 125 ksh

 Both the stanford-binay and Wexler Bellevue tests are individual tests and can be used by only one child or adult at a time
 kintu inke atirikt anya vaiyaktik pareekshan bhi hai or aise pareekshan bhi hai jinka ek baar main samuhik rup se anek vyaktiyon par prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 In terms of chronology, intelligence tests started earlier in India than personality tests
 videshi pareekshanon kaa bhartiya sthitiyon ke anukool rup taiyaar karne kaa praytn sarvapratham herbert sidru rice ne san 1922 main lahore main kiya
 Working on the binned scale of intelligence, he created the "hindustani Bin Performance Point Scale" in Urdu and Punjabi for children only
 baad main san 1935 main balak or balikaon donon ke liye bombai main vidru pidru kamath ne marathi or kannada main bine scale kii rachana kii
 Scale of the bin scale later emerged in Bengali, Hindustani, Tamil and Telugu and Hindi as well
 inke atirikt stempord parimarjan ke anek anya anukoolnon kaa vyavhaar kiya gaya
 In addition to these refinements, Sohanlal of Allahabad in 1952 organized collective intelligence in Hindi and Urdu for the children studying in the school, and in 1945, Sidhu Mdr Bhatia of Allahabad created a practical test of intelligence for Indians
 elahabaad inwing chrishchiyan kalege ke jedri henry ne san 1927 main bhartiya sthitiyon ke anukulan pratham shabdic samuhik pareekshan kaa nirmaan kiya
 Their primary classification was a mixture of tests, educational and intelligence tests and was prepared in Hindi, Urdu and English
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay ke lajjashankar jha ne san 1933 main richardsen ke "siplex mental test" kaa hindi anukulan prakashit kiya or iske baad simplex pareekshan ke hi aayu varg ke liye terman ke "group test ov mental ability" par kaary kiya
 After them Sdr Jalota and Ardr Ardhur Kumariya of Lahore, Aldr Kdr Shahdru from Lucknow, Sidrpad Philip of Madras, Sdr Mdr Mohsin of Patna etc
 have contributed towards the formulation of literal mass tests in India
 vyaktitvapareekshan kii disha main bharat main pratham prayaas lahore ke bidru maldri ne kiya
 The purpose of their "personality questionnaire" is that the emotional tests of adolescents can be classified into three subclasses based on their formulation, which are as follows: questionnaires, project tests and serialization values
 is kshetra main prashnawali vidhi kaa adhikansh bhartiya manovaigyanikon ne prayog kiya he

 For the use of projective testing of personality in India, we can refer to the adaptation of the study by the Psychology School of Allahabad and the picture frustration test of Rosenweig by Eudh Parikh
 anek bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon main vidhyaarthiyon dwaara apni shaikshik aavashyaktaa ke liye rorsha pareekshan kaa sarvaadhik prayog kiya ja rahaa he
 In connection with the use of the randomization method for personality testing, "jamuna Prasad's" Determination value of personality prosecution value "can be mentioned
 buddhipareekshanon kaa amoort buddhi kii maap kehete hai jo saamaanya maansik yogyata ke dyotak hote hai
 The promoters of this view believe that only the test of common sense is necessary for any business by the students through supportive educational policies
 is prakaar ke drushtikon kaa virodh aise manovaigyanik karte hai jo aadat kii vishistataa athwa yogyata kii vishistataa par jor dete hue kehete hai ki buddhi jaisi koi chiz nahin varan iske sthaan par anek buddhiyaan hoti hai jo amoort ke atirikt anya prakaar kii yogyataon se milakar bani hoti hai
 The fact that a person is qualified for any one field is not guaranteed that he will be equally qualified in other areas of work
 at: shuddhta ke hit main yahi uchit he ki "budhimhan" shabd ko vishisht sthitiyon ke vishisht vyavhaaron ke varnan ke liye surakshit rakhaa jaay
 Sometimes a person behaves wisely and sometimes foolishly
 "kaaran vishleshan" ke naam se khyath ek vistrut sankhyik paddati ke dwaara manushya kii yogyataon ko chhaantane ke liye anek adhyayan kiye gaye hai
 Language, mechanical, artistic, musical, clerical and athletic etc
 are the most available special abilities
 ham apane prati din ke anubhav dwaara ye dekh sakate hai ki ek vyakti inamen se kisi ek yogyata kshetra main paarangat hote hue bhi anya main hin yaa pichhadaa hua hota he
 Aptitude refers to the latent and underdeveloped ability of a person to achieve mastery in a particular skill
 at: abhivrittiyon ke maapan ke liye vishesh rup se nirmit pareekshan bhavi kshamtaaon kii prabhavotpaadakta ke purvakathan ko sambhav banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Thus, pre-judicial tests of future findings are related to different abilities, so several aptitude tests have been created to represent different areas of work
 is prakaar hamen saamaanya yantric, lipic, sangitatmak tathaa anya abhivrittipareekshan uplabdh hai
 The "minnesota Form Board" test, created after World War I, has been cited as the most valid means of measuring mechanical aptitude
 isamen alag alag bhaagon main kate do ayamonvol rekhachitr parikshya vyakti ke saamne rakhe jate hai jinamein se use aisa rekhachitr chunanaa hota he jo mul rekhachitr main dikhaae gaye thik thik bhaagon se milakar bana ho
 This test measures the mechanical capabilities associated with the articulation and breaking process of local objects
 anya abhivrittipareekshanon ke sambandh main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vishisht yogyatamapak udaahranon kii kami nahin he
 Expressions of motivational aspects of the personality of the interests have been said to develop from the felt needs
 anek vyaktiyon main vividh prakaar ke kaaryon ke liye samaan yogyata dekhi jaati he, kintu unke prati inaki abhiruchi main spasht antar hota he
 It is indisputable that we can expect satisfactory progress of a person in the same profession to which both merit and interest are present simultaneously
 at: abhiruchiyon ke maap ko yogyataon ke maap ke saath sanyukt kar dene par kisi vyakti kii kisi vyavsaay vishesh main safalataa kaa purvakathan or adhik shashakt ho jaataa he
 a number of interest questionnaires were produced, among which the "cuder Preference Record is prominent
" yah prashnawali anek prakaar ke kaaryon ke prati vyakti kii abhiruchi kaa moolyankan karne kaa prayaas karti he
 It is a descriptive value in which the test person has to express his interest — who he wants the most and who he wants least — according to each verse associated with the three possible verbs
 is prakaar hamen in nav kshetron main se prayek vyakti kii maapen uplabdh hoti hai : yantric, sangananaatmak, vaigyanik, ananayi, kalatmak, saahitiyik, sangitatmak, saamaajik seva or lipic

 iske dwaara vidhyaarthiyon ko unki lagbhag samaan yogyata kii kakshaon main vargeekrut karne main sahaayta milti he
 In order to fulfill the requirement of classified students, it is also necessary to have a well-communicated educational policy
 shaikshik nirdesan bahut anshon tak saadharantaya buddhipareekshanon dwaara naapi gai vyakti kii bauddhik abhivritti par aadhaarit hota he
 The student should be encouraged to keep his educational intent neither high nor very low, but favorable
 iske atirikt use sarvaadhik laabhprad abhiruchi viksit tathaa arjeet karne ke liye sahaayta pradaan karte hue kisi aisi abhiruchi vishesh main chipke rahane nahin dena chahie jo usne arjeet kar lee ho
 Of course, the resourcefulness of the guardian is an important supporting element in preparing him for various tasks of life
 safal vyavsaayik chunaav ke liye aavashyak he ki buddhi, abhivritti, abhiruchi or vyaktitv kii pravritiyon ke maap dwaara uplabdh tathyagat pradatton kaa satark vivechan pehle se hi kar liya jaay
 Therefore, intelligence can be measured most easily by psychological tests, hence intelligence is given more importance than any other feature in the choice of business
 phir bhi iske liye buddhi ke atirikt anya prakaar kii suchnaayen bhi aavashyak hai
 Also, personality trends such as dominance, aggression, and loyalty are highly important for certain types of commercial success
 do yaa do se adhik vyaktiyon ke bich baatcheet evam vichaaron kaa aadan-pradaan saakshaatkaar kehalaata he
 In this, one or several people ask questions to one person and that person answers these questions or expresses their opinion on them
 saakshaatkaar, sahitya kii ek vidha bhi he
 Interviews are done for different purposes
 uddeshy ke anusaar saakshaatkaar kii prakriya bhi alag-alag hoti he
 Interviews can be very thirteen- udyogon main carmik chayan hetu saakshaatkaar kaa prachlan rahaa he
 It has been used as an oldest and most popular method
 vartmaan yug main sabhi kshetron main saakshaatkaar ko anivaary saadhan ke rup main prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 It is a living social position to test the candidate and his / her compatibility
 isamen do paksh hote ho
 The negotiations between these parties form the basis of the final decision
 bingham tathaa moore ne saakshaatkaar ko ek uddeshypurna vaarta mana he
 He considered the interview as a picture by which the interviewer can be disqualified or ineligible for a particular job
 vartmaan samay main saakshaatkaar ke uddeshy kii bhinnata ko lekar kai parivartan hue hai
 Depending on the difference, the interview is sometimes selection, sometimes attitude, sometimes advice and sometimes evaluation
 vitales ne saakshaatkaar ko aavedak evam sevaayojan padaadhikariyon ke bich pratyaksh baatcheet mana he
 At present, the interview has become not only a means of obtaining information but also a primary means of measurement
 vartmaan main vyavsaayik anukulata gyaat karne kii ek vidhi ke rup main iske kai uddeshy prakat hue hai In the context of the present times, the role of interviewing is beginning to emerge as a facilitator in the behavior of a teacher and interviewer and a smooth promoter of conversation
 saakshaatkaar paddati se yah laabh hota he ki aavedak galat pratikriyaayein saralata se nahin de pate ho
 It can also act as a catalyst if the circumstances of the interview are structured
 soochna prapti kaa yah ekmaatr strot he
 At the time of the interview, the applicant keeps searching for signs that the conversation is affecting him and what the interviewers are thinking about him
 The applicant gets enlightened by these signs
 uskaa har aglaa vyavhaar isi pratyakshikaran se nirdisht hone lagata he
 Kahn and Kennel attach special importance to the motivational aspect of the interview
 inhone saakshaatkaar kii safaltaake liye in sharton ko aavashyak bataaya he- If during the interview these conditions are fulfilled at various levels like question formulation, actual operation, mental level of the candidate, his readiness and willingness to participate, then the measurement and decision given as a result will also be unmatched
 ek safal saakshaatkaarkartta mridubhashi ke saath dhairyapurvak sunne vaala bhi hota he
 All information passes through the interviewer
 isliye saakshaatkaarkartta kaa yah dharm he ki vah kaam kii soochnaaon ko ekatra kare, soochna-sanketon kii taul kare, unhen sahi rup se samanvit kare or ant main aavedak ke chayan ke bare main nirnay par pahunche
 The interview is composed by conversation
 isliye isaki safalataa bhi donon pakshon kii vaartalapiya kaushal se nirdhaarit hogi
 Sometimes, in the event of an unexpected event, the contract established during the interview gets disturbed, then in such a situation a situation of finding a new balance comes again
 udyogon main saakshaatkaar kaa chikitsaatmak upyog bhi hone laga hai
 Structured interviews are used everywhere
 vartmaan main saakshaatkaar ke siddhanth or vyavhaar main apaar parivartan hue hai
 Symonds attributes four factors to the success of the interview - vidhi kii antim safalataa is baat par nirbhar karti he ki karmchaaree sangrakshan, dusron kii gopneeyata ke liye aadar tathaa praapt soochnaaon kaa sahi upyog kiya jaae to saakshaatkaar vidhi audyogic samasyaon ke adhyayan hetu amuly dharohar siddh ho sakati he
 This system is difficult to fully trust due to errors in interview methods
 nirikshan se spasht he ki ummidavaaron kaa moolyankan karne main vibhinn saakshaatkaarkarttaaon dwaara prachur bhinnataayen saamne aati hai
 Interview is the most subjective method
 chunki moolyankanon main satat anurupata nahin hoti, isliye is vidhi ko vishwasaneey nahin mana ja saktaa
 a method that is not reliable cannot even claim to be true
 scot, hallingworth tathaa vinagar aadi ne is par adhyayan kiya
 Not everyone has relied on the reliability of this method
 saakshaatkaar kii kuch pramukh trutiyaan is prakaar hai- Most interviewers are inadvertently influenced by previously established customized responses to pointless things
 jaise- ummidavaar kii dhwani, bolne kaa dhang aadi
 In a customized response, everyone expresses their liking, dislike, but is not aware of how specific behaviors seem interesting and uninteresting to them
 vyakti kii yah dharna rahati he ki ummidavaar saakshaatkaar ke samay apni jo aadat prakat karegaa, vahi har jagah prakat karegaa
 But psychologically it has no solid basis
 isliye samanyikrut aadat main vishwaas ke falswaroop kisi nirnay par pahunchnaa kathinhai
 The interviewer should try to remain free from these kinds of habits, otherwise its decisions may be faulty and may adversely affect the entire selection work
 saakshaatkaarkartta yathasambhav swayan ko purvaagrah se mukt rakhane kaa praytn karata he
 But in spite of all possible honesty, he has some unconscious attitude which consequently affects his orientation and behavior towards things, persons and events
 isliye saakshaatkaarkarta purnroopen in purvagrahon se mukt hone kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa
 At the time of the interview, the applicants appear to be mostly fearful and not completely free
 yah bhi sambhav ho saktaa he ki koi ummidavaar ghabaraakar apni yogyataon or vichaaron ko board ke samaksh sahi rup main nahin rakh paata he
 On the contrary, weak applicants impress the board due to repeated interviews
 ummidavaar kii yogyata or uplabdhi par hi saakshaatkaar kii safalataa nirbhar nahin karti he balki is prakaar kii paristhitiyon kaa saamana karne kii chaturaai or kaushal par nirbhar karti he
 The qualified person also fails in not being proficient in the art of interviewing
 is prakaar saakshaatkaar pranali par puraa bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In this, the person imitates the behaviors and manners of others
 saakshaatkaar ke samay yah pravriti baar-baar dekhne main aati he kyonki saakshaatkaarkartta kaa sthaan ucch hone ke kaaran ummidavaar anjaane main uskaa anukaran kar usase apana tadatmya sthapit karne kii cheshtaa karata he
 Such responses also arise in the applicant on expressing the friendliness of the interviewer
 inhen anukaranaatmak pravritiyon ko galat rup se lete hai
 As a result, its decisions are also inexact in the interview
 saakshaatkaar main trutiyon kaa sabase bada strot sambhawatah vyarth shabdaawaliyon kaa puraa-puraa arth spasht nahin kiya janaa he
 Normally, the interviewees are not given any list related to the merits of the candidates
 yadi yah suchi di bhi jaati he to shaayad hi inhen spasht paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Naturally, the path opens up more for individual judgments and interpretations, leading to intense differences among the interviewers on the question of candidate selection
 nirnay sambandhi ashuddhiyon kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 But the important thing is that despite the above difficulties, the popularity of the interview does not decrease
 paraspar aamane-saamne kii is prakriya main ummidavaar ke vyaktitv tathaa vyavhaar sambandhi anek bahumoolya rahasyon kaa bhi udghaatan ho saktaa he
 Interview is a medium through which candidates get an opportunity to express their feelings and thoughts verbally
 yah ek upyogi pranali he lekin isko upyogi chayan-pranali ghoshit karne main mukhyatya do prakaar kii kathinaaiyaan aati hai- Keeping these difficulties in mind, reform suggestions can be as follows: saakshaatkaarkarta kii kushalta hi saakshaatkaar kii safalataa par aadhaarit hoti he
 It is therefore necessary that the members of the interview committee should be carefully selected
 saakshaatkaarkartta ko yogya hona chahie
 He / she should have experience of articulation, variability, adjustability and taking various interviews
 use saakshaatkaar kala main vishisht prashikshan bhi milanaa chahie
 Without this, the interviewer cannot successfully complete the interview
 saakshaatkaar ke samay inhen koi ek hi pranali apnaane tathaa samaan aachaar samhita kaa paalan karne kaa prashikshan milanaa chahie
 Bingham and Moore have given the following advice for training prospective interviewers - shilgunon ke maapan hetu vastunishth paddati honi chahie
 This requires the use of authentic evaluation criteria
 maandand main jitne bhi upkhand dikhaae jaaen, nirnay kii satyata bhi utani hi adhik hoti he
 The list of modalities should be prepared either by experience, by employee managers and supervisors in advance or the list should be constructed by analysis method
 prashnon kaa nirmaan doshapurn nahin hona chahie, jisase ummidavaar ko uskaa arth samajhane main musiibat aati ho
 It is desirable to ask social questions in the interview which are related to the desired modalities
 saakshaatkaarkarttaaon ko vibhinn samoohon main vibhakt hona chahie
 a group must interview at least once before each candidate
 isse nirnay sambandhi ashuddhiyon ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, the reliability of the interview can also increase
 upyogi hote hue bhi yah suzav shaayad hi vyaavhaarik rup main prayukt hota he
 The difficulty is that the interview takes more time, which will increase further
 saakshaatkaar maatr vichaar vinimay hi nahin he
 The external behaviors of the interviewee should also be encouraged in the interview
 is sthiti main saakshaatkaar vyavhaar athwa paristhiti pareekshanon kii bhaanti kaary karata he
 Modern psychologists have expressed the idea that objective methods can be included in the interview method based on their experiences
 ank pradaan karne kii vidhi bhi isi ke sadrush apanaayi ja sakati he
 If the same type of questions are asked to each candidate for authenticating the positions used in the interview, then the purpose of the interview is not fulfilled
 saakshaatkaar paraspar moulik vaartalap kii paddati he jisamen baatcheet main nae vichaar tathaa chintan paidaa hote hai
 But it is difficult to fully predict the direction of the conversation
 saakshaatkaar ko pramanik banane hetu vivaran suchi kii ek manakikrut prati samiti ke sadasyon ko di jaye taaki usee ke anuroop vyavhaar kiya ja sake
 In this list, by marking the list of desired virtues, they mark only the qualities to be met by the candidate
 ise 'saakshaatkaar-karmchaaree moolyankan prapatr' kehete hai
 a scholar named Gion has given the following practical suggestions for the interview- yadi saakshaatkaar main sahi tareekon ko apanaaya jaye to ise vyavsaayik chayan kaa mahatvapurn saadhan banaaya ja saktaa he
 In the words of Blum and Neller, sagar, lohaghat tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke champavat jile kaa ek gaanv he

 In return the company is able to exploit it as a marketing tool, with its one-time slogan high to "engineering differently than any other car in the world"
 W126 es-class ke vipanan ke saath is naare kaa istemaal 1980 ke dashak bhar main kiya gaya tha
 However, this slogan was discontinued after the formation of daimlerchrysler in the late 1990s and with the approval of the engineer-recommended over-budget; Later W220 models were lowered due to a drop in reliability and quality performance of the s-class
 1980 ke dashak main, marcides banj ne bundesvar univercitate munshen par professor arnst dikamens kii team ke saath milakar es-class kaa istemaal karte hue duniya kaa pehla driverlas car banaaya

 In 2005, a new infrared nighttime visibility facility was introduced
 Despite popular misconception, the s-class was not the first technology car equipped with ABS brakes, although it can now be credited with popularizing the feature to become largely standard
 niskriy suraksha suvidhaon main shaamil hai: 1957 main crample zone, 1965 main teen-sutri sitabelts, khulne or bandhanevaala stearing kollam, gambhir prabhaavon ke dauraan chaalak cell badhaayaa jaataa he or chaalak sangrakshan majboot hota he, purv durghatana seat belt tencening or sandwich platform

 iskaa nirdesan gulzaar ne kiya or ye subodh ghosh kii ek kahani par aadhaarit he
 The lead roles are Rekha, Naseeruddin Shah and Anuradha Patel
 film main ek jode kii kahani he jo juda ho jate hai or durghatanavash ek railway stesan ke pratikshalay main milte hai or ek duusare ke bina bitaye jivan ke bare main kuch sachai pate hai
 The film falls under the category of parallel cinema
 film ne sangeet varg main do rashtriya film puraskaar praapt kiye the
 The film begins with Mahendra landing at the railway station and going to the waiting room
 ek mahila sudhaa, pehle hi pratiksha kaksh main baithi he
 Seeing her, she tries to hide from him but they later interact with each other
 yah pataa chalaa ki mahendra photography kaa safal vyavsaay karata he
 He honors his grandfather
 sanyog se, vah sudhaa se 5 saal tak sagaai kiye rahaa tha lekin hameshaa apni shaadi main deree karne kaa bahaanaa banaata tha
 However, her grandfather finalized her marriage
 usne sudhaa ko bataaya ki vah maaya naam kii mahila ke saath rishte main he
 But Maya disappeared and left some poems with her
 mahendra tab sudhaa se shaadi karata he or kaaphi khush he, lekin maaya kii achaanak vaapasi unke vivaahit jivan main tanaav paidaa karti he
 When Maya attempts suicide, Mahendra starts spending time with her
 sudhaa, maaya ke aatmahatya ke prayaas ke bare main nahin jaanati or isliye maanati he ki mahendra uske saath vishwasghaat kar rahaa he
 She feels that their marriage was a mistake and questions Mahendra about her intention
 uske baad vah dridhtaa se kahata he ki vah usase baat karne ke liye maaya ko ghar laane ja rahaa he
 Sudha is against it, but Mahendra walks with determination
 haalaanki, maaya phone par sudhaa ke krodh ko sunati he or jab tak mahendra use lene ke liye pahunchataa he, vah chali gai hoti he
 When he returns home without Maya, he realizes that Sudha is also gone
 mahendra, sadame ko sahan karne main asamarth hota he or use dil kaa daura padataa he
 In the coming days and months, she is looked after by Maya
 sudhaa panchagani main ek shikshak ke rup main kaam karne lagati he
 As time passed, Mahendra began to be convinced that he should bring Sudha back home
 uske baad vah sudhaa ke patr ko padhata he ki vah use unke vivaah se mukt kar rahi he or vah maaya se shaadi karne ke liye swatantra he
 Maya feels Mahendra's sudden outcry that she was the reason for Sudha's departure and Mahendra deeply remembers Sudha
 maaya apane rishte main is achaanak parivartan par asangat mahasoos karti he or raat main, motorbike se jaati he
 Mahendra goes to chase him in his car to stop him
 maaya kaa scorf uski bike ke peeche ke pahiye main ulajh jaataa he, jisase uskaa gale dabane se mrityu ho jaati he
 After this remembrance ends, Sudha is deeply saddened to hear of the end of Maya
 baad main jab unki train kaa samay aata he, sudhaa kaa pati use lene ke liye apratyaashit rup se aata he or mahendra ko jatke se sudhaa ke punarvivaah ke bare main pataa chalata he
 As Sudha's husband leaves the waiting room with his belongings, Mahendra asks Sudha to forgive him
 vah mahendra ke pairon ko uski maafee ke liye or use chhodane kii anumati ke liye ek yachika ke rup main chooti he
 That he did not do when they were separated last time
 mahendra use ek khushhaal jivan ke liye aashirwad detaa he
 Sudha's husband returns to see how she has stopped and then seeing Sudha's tired face realizes that this man must be her ex-husband
 sudhaa or uskaa pati aage badhate hai or sudhaa pachhataave ke saath thodaa sa rukati he
 As if she does not want to go from there, while Mahendra stands helpless outside the waiting room and sees her going away
 film kaa sangeet bahut saraahaa gaya tha or film kii kahani ko bayaan karne main isaki mahatvapurn bhoomika maani jaati he
 Especially the song "mera Kuch Saamon" had a special reputation and for this both singer Asha Bhosle and lyricist Gulzar received National Film Awards

 kshetrarakshan karne vaale dal ke sadasyon main sirf wicket-keeper ko hi apane pairon main guard or dastaane pahanane kii anumati hoti he
 This is primarily a specialist role, although sometimes he is also asked to bowl, in which case another member of the fielding squad has to play the role of wicket-keeper for some time
 cricket ke niyamon main keeper kii bhoomika niyam 40 se niyantrit hoti he
 The main function of the keeper is to catch the balls that pass behind the wicket through the batsmen, but he can also try to dismiss the batsman in various ways: ek keeper kii sthiti gendbaaj par nirbhar karti he: tej gendbaaji ho rahi ho to vah stamps se thodi dur par khadaa hota he, jisase ki balle kaa kinaaraa lagakar aa rahi gend ko lapakane kaa use samay mil sake, jabaki dhimi gendbaaji ke vakt vah stamps ke kaaphi najadik pahunch jaataa he, jisase ki ballebaaj par yah dabaav rahe ki wo krij ke andar hi rahe yaa phir stump out hone kaa jokhim uthaae
 The more capable the keeper is, the more he will be able to catch fast bowling, for example, let us tell you that Godfrey Evans often kept wicket-keeping for Alec Bedser
 wicket-keeping ek visheshgy kaam he or iske liye usee tarah ke prashikshan kii jarurat hoti he jaise ki kisi visheshgy ballebaaj yaa gendbaaj se ummid kii jaati he
 However in today's time a wicket-keeper is expected to be a good batsman who can bat at least in the middle order
 jo wicket-keeper upar ke kram main ballebaaji main daksh hote hai unhen anaupchaarik rup se keeper / ballebaaj bhi kaha jaataa he
 There is only one keeper in a cricket team, so the selectors often face the challenge of choosing one of the two or more skilled keepers
 aksar aisa hota he ki do kiparon main se ek kaaphi behtareen keeper hota he, lekin vah sirf ek ausat ballebaaj hota he, jabaki doosraa keeper / ballebaaj hota he jo ballebaaji main to behatar he lekin vah apane pratidwandvi ke mukaable utana acha keeper nahin he
 The England selectors faced a similar selection dilemma in the 1990s when they were challenged to choose between Jack Russell and Alec Stewart
 ve in donon main se kisi ek ko lagaataar chunane main tab tak kabhi kaamyaab nahin hue jab tak ki 1998 main rasel sust padane lage: isse pehle tak donon kii bhoomikaayen badali jaati raheen, acchhee ballebaaji kii vajah se aksar stewart team main apni jagah banane main kaamyaab rahete the
 Similarly, Pakistani wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal is another example who is known as a wicket-keeper who squanders easy chances, but he has retained his place in the team for the past decade, as his batting from the alternative keeper Is it good
 aaj cricket main mahendra singh dhoni, kumaar sangakara, brandan makkulam or mark bouchar jaise behtareen keeper / ballebaaj hai
 The keeper may also have a captaincy role
 khaas baat ye hai ki vah kisi pari kii prayek gend main shaamil hote hai or ho saktaa he ki chizon ko vah jitani baariki se dekhne kii sthiti main hota he, utani captain nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 He can often be seen encouraging the bowlers and is also indulging in calling the batsmen "abusive" with accurate comments on his ability, personality and personal habits
 keeper hi ekmaatr kshetrarakshak he jise rakshaatmak upkaran se gend ko pakadaney kii ijaajat hoti he, jo ki aamtaur par ek bada gaddidaar dastaana hota he jisaki tarjani or anguuthe ke bich jaali lagi hoti he
 The protection that gloves provide is not always enough
 england ke keeper alan note atirikt suraksha ke liye kabhi-kabhi apane dastaane ke andar gaddi lagaaya karte the
 Wicket-keepers use leg pads to protect the legs and a box to protect the underside of the waist
 wicket-kiparon ko apane pad utarkar gendbaaji karne kaa mauka diya jaataa he or aisa tab aksar hota he jab koi match barabari kii ore bad rahaa ho yaa phir kshetrarakshan dal ek wicket lene ke liye betaab ho
 In first-class cricket, two wicket-keepers took off their pads and then took a hat-trick: in the 1954-55 match played in Cuttack, Orissa vs Bengal, in the match of Probir Sen and AC Smith in Warwickshire vs Essex in 1965 in Clacton
 In; Smith was a very unusual player, as he was primarily a wicket-keeper, but was sometimes selected as the lead bowler
 cricket ke niyamon ke niyam 2 ke mutabik ek sthanapann khilaadi wicket keeping nahin kar saktaa he
 This rule can sometimes be revoked with the consent of the captain of the batting squad, although Rule 2 does not allow any such consent
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1986 main lords main khele ja rahe england or newjiland ke bich test match kii pehali pari ke dauraan england ke visheshgy wicket-keeper bruce french chotil ho gaye the
 England then used four players as wicket-keepers in New Zealand's first innings: Bill Athey kept the keeper for the first two overs; Senior 45-year-old Bob Taylor was called and kept from the sponsors' tents and did a lot of erratic keeping from 3 to 76 overs; Hampshire keeper Bobby Parks was called for 77 to 140 overs; And then Bruce French kept wicket keeping till the last ball of the innings

 Kumbhandas was a famous poet of Ashtachap
 ye paramananddaas ji ke samakaleen the
 Kumbhandas's Charit is compiled according to the "talks of the Chaurasi Vaishnavana"
 kumbhandas braj main govardhan parvat se kuch dur "jamunaavatau" naamak gaanv main rahaa karte the
 There was farming in his house
 apane gaanv se ve parsoli chandrasarovar hokar shrinath ji ke mandir main kirthan karne jate the
 He was born in Gaurava Kshatriya clan

 He took initiation from Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya in 1492 AD
 ve puri tarah se virakt or dhan, maan, maryaada kii ichha se koson dur the
 Once Akbar was called by the emperor, he had to go to Fatehpur Sikri where he was respected
 par iskaa inhen baraabar khed hi rahaa, jaisaa ki inke is pad se vyanjit hota he- It is estimated that Kumbhandas was born to Chaitra Krishna Ekadashi in Samvat 1525 Vikrami in a village named Jamunavatto, Govardhan, Mathura
 ve gorwa kshatriya the
 His father was a simple man
 kheti karke jeevika chalaate the
 Kumbhandas also believed in paternal instinct and he liked the life of the farmer
 parsoli main vishesh rup se kheti kaa kaary chalata tha
 Lack of money kept knocking him for a lifetime, but he did not spread his hand in front of anyone
 bhagavadbhakti hi unki sampatti thi
 His family was very large, he followed it with income from farming
 parivaar main inaki patni ke atirikt saat putr, saat putr-vadhuen or ek vidhwaa bhatiji thi
 Kumbhandas was the ultimate Bhagavadbhakta, an ideal householder and a great defender
 ve ni:sprut, tyaagi or mahasantoshi vyakti the
 The unique, supernatural character of the new character was that God would appear with him and play sports with him
 mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ji unke diksha-guru the
 In the 1550 Vikrami, during the time of Acharya's goverment visit, he took Brahmasabandha
 unke diksha-kaal ke pandrah saal purv shrinath ji kii murti prakat hui thi, acharya kii ajna se ve shrinath ji kii seva karne lage the
 Even after being appointed as Kirtankar in the temple of Dixit and Shrinathji in 'pushtimarg', he did not give up his instinct and continued to maintain his family till the end
 shrinath ji ke mandir main kumbhandas nity naye pad gaakar sunaane lage
 He was given the service of kirtan only when he joined the 'confirmation community'
 kumbhandas bhagawatkrupa ko hi sarvopari maanate the, bade-se-bade gharelu sankat main bhi ve apane aasthaa-path se kabhi vichlit nahin hue
 Shrinath ji had a special interest in the creation of posts related to makeup
 ek baar vallabhacharya ji ne unke yugal lila sambandhi pad se prasann hokar kaha tha ki-"'tumhen to nikunj lila ke ras kii anubhuti ho gayi
 "kumbhandas, by the grace of Mahaprabhu, was thrilled and said," i desperately need this juice
 " After Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya's Leela-entry, Kumbhandas Gosain started singing Leela under the patronage of Vittal Nath
 vitthalanath maharaj kii un par badi krupa thi
 They praised their fearless life in mind
 samvath 1602 vikrami main 'ashtchhaap ke kaviyon' main unki gananaa hui
 The great kings and emperors used to consider their good fortune in seeing Adi Kumbhandas
 vrindavan ke bade-bade rasik or sant mahatma unke satsang kii utkrisht ichha kiya karte the
 He kept the fame of Bhagavadkti intact, never let it be tarnished by economic crisis and humiliation
 ek baar shrivitthalanath ji unhen apni dwarka yatra main saath le janaa chaahate the, unka vichaar tha ki vaishnavon kii bhent se unki aarthik paristhiti sudhar jaaygi
 Kumbhandas could not tolerate Srinathji's separation even for a moment, but he did not oppose Gosainji's orders
 ve gosai ji ke saath apsara kund tak hi gayi the ki shrinath ji ke saundarya samaran se unke ang-ang sihar uthe, bhagwaan kii madhur-madhur mand muskaan kii jyotsna virah-andhkaar main thirak uthi, maadhuryasamraat nandanandan kii virah vednaa se unka hriday ghayal ho chalaa
 He sang a verse in the disconnection of Shrinathji- shrigosai ji ke hriday par unke is virah geet kaa bada prabhaav padaa
 He did not want Kumbhandas to stay away from Shrinathji even for a moment
 kumbhandas ko unhone lautaa diya
 Kumbhandas became healthy after seeing Shrinath Jika
 ek baar mogul badshaah akbar kii rajsabha main ek gayak ne kumbhandas kaa pad gaaya
 The emperor, attracted by that position, called Kumbhandas to Fatehpur Sikri
 pehle to kumbhandas janaa nahin chaahate the, par sainik or duuton kaa vishesh aagrah dekhakar ve paidal hi gayi
 The assembly member of Shrinathji felt that Akbar's majesty was of two kinds
 kumbhandas kii pagadi fatty hui thi, taniya maili thi, ve aatmaglani main dub rahe the ki kis paap ke falswaroop unhen inke saamne upasthit hona padaa
 The emperor paid him a large tribute, but Kumbhandas felt that someone had brought him to hell
 ve sochane lage ki rajsabha se to kahin uttam braj he, jisamen swayan shrinath ji khelte rahete hai, anekon kridaayen karte karte rahete hai
 Akbar prayed to sing the verse
 kumbhandas to bhagwaan shrikrishna ke aishwarya-maadhurya ke kavi the, unhone pad-gaan kiya- The king was gentle, he respectfully sent him home
 samvath 1620 vikrami main maharaj maansingh braj aaye the
 He visited Govardhan after seeing Vrindavan
 shrinath ji ke darshan kiye
 At that time, Kumbhandas ji was performing Kirtan with Mridang and Veena
 raja maansingh unki pad-gaan style se bahut prabhavit hue
 He went to meet them in Jamunavato
 kumbhandas kii deen-hin dasha dekhakar ve chakit ho uthe
 Kumbhandas was meditating in the form of God
 aankh khulne par unhone bhatiji se asana or darpan maange, uttar mila ki ‘asana padiya kha gayi, darpan bhi pi gayi
 It meant that he used to do tilak after seeing the face in the water
 maharaja maansingh ko unki nirdhantaa kaa pataa lag gaya
 He wanted to give a mirror of gold, the devotee of God declined, the bag of pieces, the servant of the Vishwapati ignored him
 chalate samay maansingh ne jamanuvato gaanv kumbhandas ke naam karnaa chaha, par unhone kaha ki "meraa kaam to kareel ke ped or ber ke vriksh se hi chal jaataa he
 "king Mansingh praised his disinterestedness and renunciation, he said that" i have seen many devotees of Maya, but you are the real God
 " Even in old age, Kumbhandas used to come to Govardhan to visit Srinath ji regularly from Jamunavato
 ek din sankarshan kundi par anyodar ke nikat ve thahar gayi
 Chaturbhuj Das, the famous poet of 'ashtachhap', was accompanied by his younger son
 unhone chaturbhujadas se kaha ki "ab ghar chalakar kya karnaa he
 After some time the body is going to leave
 " gosai vitthalanath ji unke dehavsaan ke samay upasthit the
 Gosain ji asked that "in which time is the mind engaged?" Kumbhandas said- sung the verse in view of the image of Lal Teri Chitwan Chithi Churavai and its inter-couple form- unhone sharir chhod diya
 Gosain ji paid tribute to Karun Swar that such a Bhagwadiya endowment had taken place
 ab prithvi par sachche bhagavadbhakton kaa tirodhan hone vastav main kumbhandas ji ni:sprihata ke pratik the, tyaag or tapasya ke adarsh the, param bhagavdiy or sidhe-sade grihasth the
