 aaryon ke aadhyatmik vikaas, pracheenatam dharmikavastha or chintan ke jite-jaagate jivant udhaaharan inhen upanishdon main milte hai
 The Upanishads were probably composed during the Buddha era, as the first attempt to establish the importance of spiritual advancement on material desires resulted from the reaction of the development of Buddhist and Jain religions

 The birth story of the lame mango of Benares is also interesting
 lagbhag dhai sau varsh pehle kii ghatana he
 It is said that in a small Shiva-temple in Banaras, which had about one acre of land, surrounded by Chahar walls, a monk came and asked the priest of the temple to stay there for a few days
 pujari ne kaha, ``mandir parisar main kai kaksh hai, kisi main bhi thahar jaaen
 The monk fumed in a room
 sadhu ke paas aam ke do chote-chote paudhe the, jo usne mandir ke peeche apane haathon se rope diye
 As soon as he woke up in the morning, he would first give him water, as Kalidasa's Shakuntala used to do while living in the ashram of Kanvastra
 sadhu ne bade manoyog ke saath un paudhon kii dekharekh kii
 He stayed there for four years
 in chaar barason main ped kaaphi bade ho gayi
 In the fourth year, mango leaves also came out, which was broken by the monk and offered it to Lord Shankar
 phir vah pujari se bolaa, ``meraa kaam puraa ho gaya
 i am a beauty lover kal subah hi banaras chhod duungaa
 If you take care of these plants and bear fruits, then cut them in many parts and offer them to Lord Shankar, then distribute them to the devotees as offerings, but do not forget to give the whole mango to anyone
 kisi ko na to vriksh kii kalam lagane dena or na hi guthli dena
 Burn the kernels, otherwise people will plant it and plant it
 or vah sadhu banaras se chalaa gaya
 The priests of the temple looked after those plants with great fervor
 kuch samay pashchaat paudhe puure vriksh ban gayi
 Every year a lot of fruits started growing in them
 pujari ne vaisaa hi kiya, jaisaa ki sadhu ne kaha tha
 People who ate that mango as prasadam became crazy about the taste of that mango
 logon ne baar-baar pujari se puraa aam dene kii yachana kii, taaki uski guthli laakar ve uskaa paudha bana saken, par pujari ne aisa karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 The discussion of this mango reached the ears of the King of Kashi and one day he came to the temple from Ram Nagar to see the trees himself
 unhone shraddhapurvak bhagwaan shiv kii puja kii or vrikshon kaa nirikshan kiya
 Then it was proposed to the priest that he should give permission to the chief gardener to plant his buds
 pujari ne kaha, ``aapaki ajna ko main bhala kaise taal saktaa hoon
 Today i will pray to Shankarji at the time of evening worship and after getting his indication, i will come to the palace tomorrow and see the government and will also take the offerings of the temple
 isi raat bhagwaan shankar ne swapn diya, ``kaashi naresh ke anurodh ko meri ajna maanakar vrikshon main kalam lagavane den
 Get it as many colors as you want
 tum isamen rukaawat mat daalana
 They are Kashiraj and in a way are our representative forms in this city
 duusare din praatkaal kii puja samaapt kar prasad rup main aam ke tokare lekar pujari kaashi naresh ke paas pahunchaa
 The king immediately received Prasad and found a supernatural taste in him
 kaashi naresh ke pradhan-mali ne jaakar aam ke vrikshon main kai kalmen lagaayin, jinamein varshakaal ke baad kaaphi jaden nikali hui paayi gayin
 The cuttings were cut and brought to Maharaj and on his orders he was planted in the palace premises
 kuch hi varshon main ve vriksh banakar fal dene lage
 Many trees were produced by the pen
 mahal ke baahar unka ek chota-sa baag banavaa diya gaya
 Later, other trees were produced from them and in this way many large orchards of lame mangoes were formed in Ramnagar
 aaj bhi jinhen banaras ke aasapaas yaa shahar ke khule sthanon main jane kaa mauka mila hoga, unhen langade aam ke vrikshon or baagon kii bharmaar najar aayi hogi
 There are hundreds of lame mango trees in the vast vast courtyard of the Hindu University
 baat yah thi ki sadhu dwaara lagaaye hue paudhon kii samuchit dekharekh jis pujari ne kii thi, vah langadaa tha or isiilie in vrikshon se paidaa hue aam kaa naam langadaa pad gaya or aaj tak is jati ke aam saare bharat main isi naam se prasiddh hai

 Pashtuns and Sikhs had fought a lot of fierce battles in this area earlier, so they built a four Ghaz thick and 16 Ghaz high wall around the entire township

 Gradually the area became calm and in 1835, when German passenger Baron Hoygel passed through it, he found that this defense wall had collapsed because it was no longer needed
 haripur faltaa-phulataa gaya or ek vistrut shahar or zila ban gaya
 In March 1849, when the British captured the Sikh Empire and made it a part of the British Raj, this area also became part of it

 Conversely, fluid dynamics is the branch of science in which moving, turbulent or discontinuous fluids are studied
 jab dore se bandhe batkhare aadi kisi baari pind ko pani main dubokar dore ko pakade rahete hai, tab dekha jaataa he ki itnaa bal nahin lagaana padataa, jitna bal us pind ko pani se baahar khinch lene par lagata he
 The reason why this happens is first discovered by the mathematician Archimedes and theorized that the fluid exerts a vertical exerting force on a body immersed in a fluid, which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body
 utkshep kaa nidaan karte samay taral daab kii sankalpana saamne aati he, arthath ek aise bal kii jo taral apane se sampark main aae hue pind ke prayek prishth alpaansh par lagaataa he
 The existence of such pressure gives us the impression that force is required to stop the water coming out of the hole
 archimedies ke niyam kii vyakhya is pariklpana ke aadhaar par di ja sakati he ki taral daab taral ke samparkwaale pind ke prishth-alpaansh par lambat: kriya karata he
 To bring clarity to the concept of pressure, the pressure intensity is defined by saying that it is the limit of the ratio of the force exerted by the liquid to the area of the surface, when the area moves towards zero
 prachandta kii sakanlpana kaa ek mahatvapurn laabh yah he ki taral ke prayek bindu par iskaa maan gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be proved that at a point of liquid the pressure of pressure in all directions is equal and it is called the hydrostatic daw at that point
 sanketakshar p dwaara ise prakat karte hai
 The amplitude of this pressure is the force per unit area

 According to this principle only - 'khojahi Dadak Sada Nija Level'
 jalprabandh main is gun kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or utsrut coop bhi isi kaaran chal pate hai
 Based on this, Leonardo de Vinci posited a law of transmittance of fluid pressure that if at any point in the fluid without increasing the geometric limits, the pressure is automatically increased at each point of the fluid

 If a flushed body is given different positions in which the fluid displaced by it is equal to the weight, then the point of the buoyancy center is called the buoyant plane and the position of the body in equilibrium is the position in which between the buoyancy center and the center of gravity of the body
 The distance is maximum or minimum

 The main curvilinear centers of the buoyancy are called perfusion centers

 The internal rate of return or internal rate of return is used to measure and compare the return on investment in a capital budget, which is also called the money flow discount rate of return, or simply the rate of return
 bachat or rin ke sandarbh main iiar ko prabhavi byaaj dar bhi kaha jaataa he
 The term internal refers to the fact that its calculation does not include environmental factors
 aatanrik pratifal dar par nivesh yaa sambhavit nivesh, vaarshik prabhavi jatil pratifal dar he
 This rate can be earned by investing capital
 adhik parichit shabdon main, ek nivesh kaa IRR wo byaaj dar he jisapar nivesh kii laagat nivesh kaa laabh detii he
 This means that all the profits from the investment are inherent to the time value of the money and that is why the net present value of the investment at this interest rate is zero
 kyonki aantarik pratifal dar ek parimaap dar he, yah kaary kushalta, gunvattta yaa nivesh kii aay kaa suchak he
 This is the exact opposite of net present value

 When the calculated IRR is different from the actual reinvestment rate for the interim cash flow, the annual equivalent return will reflect the assessment more accurately
 The company may have additional projects that are exactly the same for investing interim cash flow
 May have attractive expectations ye iiar ko udhyam puunji ke aankalan or anya nijee equity nivesh ke liye upyukt banaata he
 Such strategies usually require a lot of cash investment during the entire project
 lekin ant main ye keval ek hi nakadi bahirpravaah ko dekhati he Since IRR does not consider the cost of capital, it should not be used to compare projects with different periods

 When a project has multiple irrs, it can be even easier to calculate the project with the benefit of its reinvestment, according to the MIRR, which has an estimated reinvestment rate, usually this rate is equal to the cost of the project
 Is equal
 en pi ve kii majboot shaikshik pasand ke baavjood, surveykshanon se sanket miltaa he ki adhikari IRR ko NPV kii jagah zyada mahatv dete hai
 Generally, managers find it easier to compare investments of different sizes, if they are about the percentage of return rate from dollars of NPV
 However, NPV is still "more accurate" in terms of trade value
 ek nivesh kushalta ke parimaap ke rup main, IRR, poonji niyantran karne jaisi halaaton main behatar antardrushti rakhata he
 However, when comparing mutually specific projects, NPV is the appropriate measure

 Thus the internal rate or rates follow the net present value as a function of the rate of return
 is prakriya nirantar he
 If we move towards the rate of return of -100% net present value, the net present value moves towards infinity with the sign of the previous cash flow and the positive infinite of the rate of return, the net present value goes towards the first cash flow
 Therefore, if there are different signs of the first and last cash flows, then there is an internal rate of return

 data from saamaanya visheshtayen Display kanhopatra ek 15 veen sadi ke marathi sant-kavyatri thi
 Was revered by the Varkari sect of Hinduism
 sabase paaramparik ke anusaar, kanhopatra ek veshya or naachne lashaki thi
 She believed in the Varkari religion
 vah bidar ke badshaah kii upapatni se bina varkari ke hindu bhagwaan vithoba-devtaa sangrakshak ko aatmasamarpan karne ke liye chunaae
 He died in the main temple of Vithoba in Pandharpur
 sirf unho ek hi vyakti kiske samadhi mandir ke parisar ke bheetar he
 Kanhopatra used to write a poem about her devotion to Vithoba and her struggle to balance her modesty with her Marathi Ovi and Abhanga
 unki kavitaaon main, bhagwaan vithoba uske rakshak banate the or apane peshey ke changul se use reeha karne ke liye prarthana kar rahi thi
 His thirty unicorns have survived even today and people still sing
 vah sirf ek hi mahila sant varkari,jinhone pavitrataa keval unki bhakthi ke aadhaar guru bina praapt kiye he
 The history of Kanhopatra has been known through the centuries for people that their stories have been passed down and their stories have become difficult to find fact and fiction
 uske janm ke bare main shamaa kar ke log maanate he or uski mouth vithoba mandir jab bidar ke badshaah ne usko chaah
 However, the characters of Sadashiv Malgujar and Hausa Maid do not appear in their characterizations
 kanhopatra ek amir veshya shamaa ki bethi thi, jo pangarpur ke mangalved shehar me rahete the
 Apart from Kanhopatra, Mangalveda saints Varkari Chokhamela and Damaji were also unsure of the identity of Shama Kanhopatra's father, but it was suspected that the head man of the city is Sadashiv Malgujar's birthplace
 kanhopatra uski maan ke mahalanuma ghar main uske bachapan bitaayaa thi or kai naukaraaniyon dwaara seva karaate the
 The social status of Kanhopatra was very low
 kanhopatra bachapan se hi nrity or geet main prashikshit kiya gaya tha taaki vah apni maan ke peshey main shaamil hone saki
 He became a talented dancer and singer
 uski sundarataa apsara menka se tulana karte the
 Shama suggested to Kanhopatra that the king should meet, then his beauty and gifts to him would be worshiped by money and ornaments but Kanhopatra flatly refused
 kanhopatra kii maa shaama ne kanhopatra ko shaadi karwaane ke liye sochaa tha
 The scholar Tara Bhavalakar has been told that Kanhopatra's marriage was forbidden because she is a slave
 kanhopatra ko veshya ke jivan me aashaa nahi thi lekin uske liye ghruna kiye the or bhi log kehete hey ki vah veshya banane ke liye majbooti se manaa ki thi
 Some writers believe that she may have also worked as a prostitute
 sadashiv malguzar, kanhopatra kii apeksha kii pita, kanhopatra kii sundarataa ke bare main suna he or uske nrity ko dekhne ke liye kaamana kii, lekin kanhopatra se inkaar kar diya
 Accordingly, Sadasiva started harassing Kanhopatra and Shama
 shamaa use samajha diya he ki vah kanhopatra kaa pita tha or is tarah unhen chhod dena chahie kii koshish kii, lekin sadashiv use vishwaas nahin kiya
 As he continued his persecution, Shama's wealth gradually ran out
 aakhirkaar, shamaa sadashiv ke liye maafee maangi or use karne ke liye kanhopatra pesh karne kii peshkash kii
 Kanhopatra, however, escaped to Pandharpur with the help of his aged maid Hausa disguised as a maid
 kuch kinvadantiyon main, housa varnit ke rup main ek varkari bhakthi karne ke liye kanhopatra kii yatra ke liye shrey diya
 Other accounts gave Varkari pilgrims who passed through Kanhopatra's house on their way to the Vithoba temple in Pandharpur
 ek kahani ke anusaar, udhaaharan ke liye, vah vithoba ke bare main ek guzar varkari se poocha
 Varkari said that Vithoba is "generous, intelligent, beautiful and right", her glory is beyond description and surpasses her beauty as that of Lakshmi, the goddess of beauty
 kanhopatra aage poocha ki kya vithoba ek bhakt ke rup main use sweekaar karenge kya or varkari kah ki vah kanhopatra ko sweekaar karenge
 This assurance strengthened his resolve to go to Pandharpur
 kanhopatra turant varkari tirthayatriyon ke saath vithoba-ke bhajan pangarpur-gayan ke liye chhod detaa he yaa pangarpur uske saath uski maan ko bhi samajhakar jati thi
 When Kanhopatra has seen the Vithoba image of Pahli Bar Pandharpur, he started singing the Abhangas
 vah ek abhanga main gaayi thi ki use aadhyatmik yogyata puri kii thi or vah vithoba ke pairon dekha he ke liye aashirwad diya tha
 The unique beauty she found in Vithoba was her groom's demand
 vah bhagwaan se "vivaahit" khud ko mana or pangarpur main bas gaye
 He withdrew from society
 kanhopatra hausa ke saath pangarpur main ek jhopadi main le jaaya gaya or ek tapasvi kaa jivan jiya
 She sang and danced in the Vithoba temple, and cleaned it twice a day
 vah logon ke sambandh main praapt kii,or log maanate the ki vah ek kisaan ki bethi thi
 On this period, Kanhopatra composed Ovi poems dedicated to Vithoba
 is avadhi par sadashiv badshaah se madad maanga
 Hearing tales of Kanhopatra's beauty, the king ordered her to become his mistress
 jab usne manaa kar diya, raja bal dwaara use paane ke liye apane aadamiyon ko bheja tha
 Kanhopatra took refuge in the Vithoba temple
 raja ke sainikon mandir ko gher liya or ise nasht karne ke liye agar kanhopatra unhen saunp diya gaya tha nahin kii dhamkee di
 Requested a previous meeting with Vithoba before being taken to Kanhopatra
 sabhi isaab ke dwaara, kanhopatra to vithoba chhavi ke pair main nidhan ho gaya, lekin halaat spasht nahin the
 According to popular tradition, Kanhopatra merged with Vithoba's image in a form of waiting for marriage — something Kanhopatra
 anya siddhanton kaa suzav he ki vah khud ko maar daalaa he, yaa ki vah uski nirankushta ke liye maar daalaa gaya tha
 majority of
 isaab kehete he ki kanhopatra ke sharir vithoba ke charnon main rakhi gai thi or uske baad mandir ke dakshini bhaag ke paas dafnaaya gaya tha
 According to all versions of the legend, a Tarti tree — worshiped by its pilgrims — arose on the spot where Kanhopatra was buried
 kanhopatra keval ek hi vyakti jiskaa samadhi vithoba mandir ke parisar main he
 Many historians have tried to establish the date of life and death of Kanhopatra
 ek anumaan uski bidar ke bahamani ek raja, jo aksar kanhopatra kahani haalanki zyaadaatar khaaton main, ki raja ko spasht rup se namit kabhi nahin jaataa he ke saath judaa hua he ke sambandh main se lagbhag 1428 sii uske jivan detaa he
 Pawar estimates that she died in 1480
 dusron ko 1448, 1468 yaa 1470, yaa bas kii tarikhon kaa kahana he ki vah 15 veen sadi yaa durlabh maamalon main, 13 veen yaa 16 veen sadi main rahete the kaa suzav he
 According to Jelliot, he was a contemporary of saint-poets Chokhamela and Namdeva
 kanhopatra kai abhanga bana he mana jaataa he, lekin sabase likhit rup main nahin the: use kaa keval tees yaa ovis aaj jivit rahete hai
 Twenty-three verses of his poems, called the gross saint-saga, are included in the compilation of Varkari saints
 in geeton main se adhikansh aatmakathaatmak hai karunaa kaa ek tatv ke saath likhaa gaya he
 His style is described by the poetic instruments as plain easy to understand, and is performed with a simplicity of expression

 Kanhopatra's Abhanga often portrays her struggle between her profession and her devotion to Vithoba as Varkari's patron deity
 vah khud ko ek mahila ko gaharaa use use uske peshey ke asahneeya bandhan se bachaane ke liye vithoba ke liye samarpit he, or nivedan karnaa ke rup main prastut karata he
 Kanhopatra speaks of his insult and his exile from society because of his profession and social stature
 nako main devaraay anta aata par mana jaataa he uske jivan-asamarth use bhagwaan se alag hone ke bare main sochaa sahan karne kii antim abhanga hone ke liye, kanhopatra uske dukh ko samaapt karne ke vithoba bhi janm detii he

 Therefore this book is called "patisambhidabhagha"

 akushal dharm jo ki dey he prahatavya hai
 The efficient religion to be practiced is Bhavitavya

 Meditation, Vimoksha, Marg Phaladi Dharma and especially Nirvana are personal duties is anubhuti kii prapti se chaar prakaar kii patisambhidaayen sahaayak hoti hai - dhamm-patisambhida, atth patisambhida, nirutti patisambhida or patibhaan-patisambhida 
 Knowledge of all religious practices is necessary for the realization of the essence
 isaki prapti dhamm patisambhida se hoti he
 Enters the depth of the meaning of religions
 or unka yatharth gyaan praapt kar lete hai: yah atth patisambhida kehalaata he
 Both religion and meaning are dependent on language
 isaliye dharmagyaan or arthgyan kii prapti ke liye bhashaa kaa gyaan bhi apekshit he
 This is possible from Niruti Patisambhida

 There are three waggas of the Patisambhidamagg, named by the magnitude
 mahavagg, majjhimvagg or chullavagg
 The second and third are also called Yuganadhavagga and Mahapanavagagga respectively
 prayek vagg ke das das vibhaag hai, jo kathaayen kehalaate hai, ve nimna prakaar hai- 1
 Mahavagga: Jnanakatha, Vittikatha, Aanapanasatikatha, Indriyakatha, Vimokkhakatha, Gatikatha, Kammakatha, Vipallasakatha, Maghakkatha and Mandapayyakatha
 2
 majjhim vagg : yuganddhakatha, sachhakatha, bojangkatha, mettakatha, viragakatha, patisambhidakatha, dhammachakkakatha, lokutarakatha balakatha or summakatha
 3
 Chullavagga: Mahapanakatha, Idthikatha, Abhisamayakatha, Vivekatha, Chariakatha, Patihariyakatha, Samasicakatha Satipatthanakatha Vipassanakatha and Matikakatha
 kathaayen krambaddh hai
 According to Atthakatha, in 30 legends, the scripture has been given the first place because the right vision is the first part of the Buddha-guided path
 gyaan se mithyaadrushti dur ho jaati he
 Therefore Vittikatha is given only after the scripture
 mithyaadrushti ke dur hone se chitt samadhisth hota he
 Satipathana has a prominent place in Samadhibhavana
 isaliye dittikatha ke baad hi anapanastiktha di gai he
 Faithful memory is reinforced by the practice of the five senses
 isaliye anapanastiktha ke baad hi indriyakatha di gai he
 With the practice of the senses, the mind becomes free from bondage
 isaliye indriyakatha ke baad hi vimokkhakatha di gai hai
 Not all the living beings can attain salvation
 jo sugatiyon main janm lete hai, ye hi use praapt kar sakate hai
 That is why the story is given only after the democracies
 kisi jeev kii gati uske karmanusaar hoti he
 That is why the story is given only after the story
 chaar prakaar ke viparyason ke kaaran jeev karmsanchay karte hai
 Therefore, the Vipallas Katha and the Magha Katha are given after the Kammakatha
 is vagg kii antim katha mandapey katha he
 Mand means essence
 iskaa prog sarabhoot aryamarg ke liye hua he
 Similarly, serialization of other stories has also been shown
 in kathaon main varnit adhikansh vishay ek na ek sutt par ashrith hai
 In fact, the subject has been interpreted as a description of a Sutta
 in vyakhyaaon kaa bada mahatv he
 That is why later descriptions of Patisabhidamagg are mentioned in the description of those subjects
 vishuddhimaarg main to inaki bahulata he
 The style of patisambhidamagg, which is analytical, resembles the style of abhidhamma
 isaliye kuch vidwaanon ne ise abhidhamm pitak ke antargat karne kii upyuktata bataai he
 But, as mentioned above, the description of each subject is based on a rough principle
 kahin kahi dharm paryaayon kaa vishleshan abhidharm pranali kii drushti se bhi hua he
 Keeping these things in mind, we can say that this book must have been composed in the Middle Ages, after the collection of ancient sattanas and before the editing of the Abhidharmapitaka
 atthkatha main sariputt ther ko patisambhidamagg kaa rachayita bataaya gaya he
 Modern scholars are not willing to accept this
 lekin atthkatha kii manyata bhi niraadhaar nahin he
 The style of this book is similar to the style of sattantas of Sariputta Ther
 sanmaditthi, sampasadaniya sangeetipariyaay, dasuttar or mahavedall sutt iske katipay udhaaharan hai
 Yes, the principles of God and some of his other disciples are also stored in it, but only the principles of Sariputta Ther are prominent
 sambhavat: isi baat ke kaaran pracheen parampara sariputt ther ko patisambhidamagg kaa rachayita bataane ke paksh main rahi hogi

 adhyay chaar saat kumhaar harry waapas upar bhaaga apane bedroom ke liye, samay bas main khidki par pahunchane ke liye 'dursleys drive or sadak band se baahar jhulate car dekhen
 sheersh topi he Dedalus peeche main chachee gahare nile rang or Dudley ke bich dikhaai de rahaa tha
 Privet recovered at the end of the car drive, his windows burned red for a moment now at sunset and then he was gone
 harry upar he Hedwig pinjre, uski Firebolt uthaaya or uske ruksaa, uski aswabhaavik saaf bedroom aakhri vyapak dekhne diya or phir apane bhadda raste waapas haul, jahaan vah pinjre, naala jamaa karne ke liye neeche he or sidhiyon ke pair ke paas bag 
 prakaash fading teji se gaya tha, haul shaam prakaash main chaaya se bharaa he
 It felt weird to stand here in silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time
 bahut pehle, jab vah akelaa chhod diya gaya tha jabaki Dursleys baahar chalaa gaya ke liye khud kaa anand len, ekant ke ghante ek durlabh ilaaj kiya gaya tha
 The only stop was to sneak something delicious from the fridge, he rushed upstairs to play Dudley on the computer or put it on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart's content
 It gave him a strange, empty feeling remembering those times, it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost
 vah "aap ke liye jagah main ek aakhri dekho le janaa chahta hoon nahin he?" Hedwig, jo abhi bhi uske pankhons ke neeche uske sir ke saath udhaas poocha
 "ham yahan phir kabhi nahin hoga
 aap sabhi achche samay yaad nahin karnaa chaahate? meraa matlab he, is doormat dekho
 yaaden 


 Dudley par sobbed ke baad main use dementors se bachaaya

 pichhali garmiyon main, Dumbledore ki saamne vaale daravaaje ke madhyam se chalaa gaya 


 " harry ek pal ke liye apane vichaaron kaa dhaagaa kho diya he or Hedwig madad karne ke liye use waapas laane ke liye kuch nahin kiya, lekin uske pankhons ke neeche uske sir ke saath baithne ke liye jari rakhaa
 Turned his back to Harry's front door
 "or yahan ke tahat, Hedwig" - harry khulaa sidhiyon ke neeche ek darwaja khinch liya - "jahaan main sota tha! tum to kabhi nahin pataa tha mujhe - blimey, yah chota he, main bhul gaya tha
 

 "harry looked around at the stacked shoes and remembering how he used to wake up every morning looking at the bottom of the staircase, which was more often than not decked with a spider or two
 Those days were Before he had known anything about his true identity, before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him
 But Harry is still a dream So that could remember her headstrong is, even in those days: the green light and visions once shining confused - Uncle Vernon had nearly car when Harry had recounted - crashed a flying motorcycle
 

 vahaan ek achaanak, kahin paas se gaganabhedi garjan tha
 Straight with Harry a jerk and hitting the top of his head on the low door frame
 Stopping only to do some work of uncle's choicest words, he staggered back into the kitchen, grabbing his head and staring out the window at the back garden
 The darkness seemed to be rippling, pulsing in the air itself
 Then, one by one, the figures began pop vision as their disillusioned charm
 drishy haaavee Hagrid tha, ek helmet or kaale chashme or ek kaale sanlagn maadak dravya ke saath ek vishaal motorcycle savaar hokar baithe pahane
 uske aasapaas sabhi anya logon ko jhaadu se dismounting the or do maamalon, kankal, kaale pankh ghodon main
 peeche ke daravaaje khule Wrenching, harry unke bich main hurtled
 Hermione vahaan uske aasapaas uski bahon daraaj ke rup main greeting kii ek saamaanya ro rahaa tha, ron use peeth par tali bajaakar or Hagrid ne kaha, "sabhi righ ', harry? taiyaar fer band? " "nishchit rup se harry ne kaha, un sab main chaaron ore muskuraate
 "lekin main aap main se kai is ummid nahin thi!" "yojana main parivartan pagal-netra, jo do vishaal ubhada boriyon jot rahaa tha or jaadui jinaki aankh akaash darkening se katai tha buland tezi ke saath ghar ke bageeche main," growled
 "chalo mukhute mil isse pehle ki ham aap ise madhyam se baat karte hai
 "where Harry led them all back into the kitchen, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, Aunt herself sat on the dark blue gleaming work surfaces, or leaned against her immaculate instruments, Ron, tall and lean, Hermione, her wild a long braid tied in back, Fred and George, smiling identically; Bill, badly hurt and long-haired, mad, eyed, war-worn Mr
 Weasley, what kind of faced, balding, a little bit of his Ripple Glasses; One leg, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was his bright pink, Lupine, grayer's favorite shade and more, Line Fleur, thin and beautiful, with her long blonde hair Silverley; Kingsley, bald and broad-shouldered, Hagrid with his bushy hair and beard, standing hunch to avoid hitting his head on the roof and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, Despicable and his hound with droopy beady eyes and matted hair
 He seemed to see Harry's heart expanding and glowing: feeling incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had met the last time they had tried to strangle him
 "kingsle, maine sochaa he? vah kamare main bulaayaa aap Muggle pradhanmantri ke baad dekh rahe the"
 ", kingsle ne kaha ki vah mere bina saath ek raat ke liye praapt kar sakate hai", "aap or adhik mahatvapurn rahe hai
 "harry, guess what?" Tonks nestled her on top of the washing machine and she wiggled her left hand at him, a ring glistened there
 "have you married?" Harry yelped to see him for Lupine "
" I'm sorry there won't be, Harry, it was very quiet
 " "yah shandaar Congrat he, -" ", shorgul bhar main sab thik he, thik he, ham ek aaraamdeh pakadaney ke liye samay baad hoga," mudi garjana kii or chuppi rasoi main gir gaya
 Moody dropped on his feet and turned to Harry for his sacks
 "jaisaa ki Dedalus shaayad tum se kaha, hamen tyaag yojana e Pius Thicknesse par chalaa gaya he, jo hamen detaa he ek badi samasya thi
 He made it an imprisonable crime to connect to the Floo network, place this house here, in a Portkey, or Apparate in or out
 All done in the name of your safety, to prevent you, find out who you are getting into
 bilkul vyarth, apni maan ke aakarshan ke rup main dekh rahaa he ki pehle se hi he
 To stop what he really did is getting you out of here safely
 " "doosraa samasya: tum underage hai, jiskaa matlab he aap abhi bhi tum par he tres mila he
 "I" not "-" Trace! Trace said "crazy-eye impatiently
" The charm that detects magical activity around the lower seventeens, the way the Ministry came to know about underage magic! If you, or someone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it and will therefore devour death
 "" We can't wait for the trace to break, because at this time you lose all the security your mother would have given you
 Seventeen can change
 sankshep main, Pius Thicknesse sochataa he ki vah tumhaare paas he cornered achche or uchit
 " harry lekin madad nahin agyaat Thicknesse ke saath sahamat nahin kar sake
 "so what are we going to do?" "we're going to use only the means of transport left us, only trace people, not because we don't need to cast spells to use them: sweep, thestrals and motorcycles can Hagrid
 " harry is yojana main kharabi dekhne ke liye, lekin vah apni jeebh ko yojit karne kaa pagal-netra karne ke liye unhen pataa mauka de saktaa he
 "now, your mother's attraction will break under only two conditions: when you age," or "come - Moody pointed around the ancient kitchen -" you now call home to this place
 tum or tumhaare chachaa or chachee apane alag tareeke se aaj raat ja rahe hai, puri samaj he ki aap phir se ek saath rahete hai sahi he, kabhi nahin ja rahe hai main? " harry sir hilaayaa
 "so at this time, when you leave, there is no going back and breaking the charm moment
 You will be outside your limits
 We are choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for you, know who came
 And the moment you seize the seventeen turn
 "one thing we have got on our side is that you know who does not know we are going tonight
 ham mantralay se ek nakli nishaan li he: unhen lagata he ki aap tisvaan tak nahin ja rahe hai
 However, this is you, know, with whom we are dealing, so we cannot trust that the date is getting wrong, it is a couple of general death eater patrols in this area only in case
 So, we have given a dozen different every conservation houses we can throw at them
 ve sab ve jagah ham aap ko chhipaane ke liye ja rahe hai, ve sab aadesh ke saath kuch conection: mere ghar mil gaya he ho saktaa he kii tarah lag rahi he, kingsle jagah he, chachee he Muriel - kya tum yah vichaar miltaa he mauli
 " "haan harry, nahin puri tarah sachai se," ne kaha kyonki vah abhi bhi yojana main ek duuri chhed hajir kar sakate hai
 "you'll be going to Tonks's parents
 Once you're within the limits of the protective enchantments we've put on their house you'll be able to use a Portkey for the bill
 Any questions?" - Er yes, Harry said
 "maybe they know which of the twelve safe houses I'm going to go to first, but it's kind of obvious once" won't - won't - that's a quick headcount display "of the fourteen of us Tonks fly towards parents? " ", Ah Moody said," i forgot to mention the main point
 ham main se chaudaa Tonks he mata pita ko nahin udne denge
 Seven Harry's moving through the sky will be the potters tonight, each of them with a companion, each a different pair heading for the safe house
 " uske vastra andar mudi ab se ek flask waapas le liya jo mitti kii tarah lag rahaa tha
 Another word for him to say, there was no need for immediate understanding of the rest of Harry's plan
 ! "vah nahin" jor se kaha, uski aawaaj rasoighar ke madhyam se baj rahi he
 "no!" Said Hermione with a hint of decency, "I told them you should take it that way"
 "if you think I'm going to let six people risk their lives!" "- Because this is the first time for all of us," Ron said
 "it's different, pretend to be me -" "well, none of us really imagined it, Harry Fred," insisted
 "kalpana kiijie agar kuch galat ho gaya tha or ham ke rup main funs gaye the specky, sookhaa gits hameshaa ke liye
" harry muskaan nahin kiya
 "you can't do this if i can't cooperate, you give me some hair for my need
" "george said well, that's scuppered plan"
 "obviously there is no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair as long as you have cooperation
 ", fred ne kaha, "haan, ek ladkaa jo jaadu kaa upyog karne kii anumati nahin he ke khilaaf ham main se teraa, ham koi mauka nahin mila he"
 "ajeeb baat he harry," vastav main manoranjak, "kaha
", mudi, apni jaadui ab apni gartika main ek chota sa spandan aankh growled "agar yah karne ke liye bal aa gaya he, to yah hoga" ke rup main vah harry par glared
 "yahan adhik badha hua, potter sab log or ve sab karne ke liye jokhim lene ke liye taiyaar hai
 "mundungus shrugged and grimaced, magical eye gaze swerved sideways out of Moody's head at him
" Let's have another argument

 "to, potter - apane baalo ke kuch he, agar aap kripaya
" harry ron par glanced he, jo ek hi main ghar kaa rasta prakaar main us par grimaced
 ! "ab" mudi barked
 us par unki aankhon kii sab ke saath, harry uske sir ke upar tak pahunche, bal kii ek hank pakadaa or khinch liya
 "moody said that's good," he limped forward as he pulled the stopper out of the medicine flask
 "yahan main sidhe, agar aap kripaya
" harry mudlike taral main bal gira diya
 The moment it approached with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then again, all at once, giving it a clear, bright gold
 , Hermione ne kaha, "oh, tum bahut Crabbe or Goyle, harry kii tulana main swaadisht dekho," ron uthaaya ibro kii drushti pakadaney se pehle, thodaa sharmaa or kaha, "oh, tumhen pataa he main kya - kya matlab he Goyle aushadhi dibbe kii tarah chakhaa
", mudi ne kaha, "thik he phir, yahan par nakli kumhaar line ap, to kripaya"
 ron, Hermione, fred, jorge or Fleur chachee gahare nile rang sinc gleaming ke saamne khadey hai
 "we're making a short", Lupine said
 "said here," Hagrid gruffly and he picked up Mundungus by the scruff and dropped it down to Fleur, who wrinkled his nose by aiming to move along and Fred and George instead standing between
 , Mundungus ne kaha, "i'ma sainik, main jaldi hi ek rakshak ho jayega"
 "ise band karo mudi," growled
 "jaisaa ki maine aapako pehle hi bataa diya he, tum ati durbal keedaa, kisi bhi maut ham potter par kabja karne ke liye lakshya hoga, use maar nahin main chalaa bhakshan

 "mundungus doesn't seem particularly convinced, but Moody already had half a dozen egg-shaped glasses, the first cloak she is pulling out from inside, to put a small Polyjuice potion in each
 "kul milakar, to 


" ron, Hermione, fred, jorge, Fleur or Mundungus piya

 Hermione or Mundungus urdhv shooting kar rahe the, ron, fred or jorge sikudte the, unke bal darkening tha, Hermione he or Fleur dikhne pichde unki khopadi main goli maar karne ke liye
 Moody, quite indifferent, now loosened the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him
 jab vah phir se sidhaa he, vahaan chah haanfate harry kumhaar or uske saamne putai the
 Fred and George turned from each other and said together, "wow - we're the same!" "fred said i don't know, though, i think I'm still better-looking", testing my reflection in the kettle
 "bah," Fleur said, checking himself into the microwave door Bill, "I don't think - I'm 'ideous
" "those clothes that are a little roomy, I've got little moody here, a hint of the first sack," and vice-versa, "said the adverse
 Don't forget the glasses, there are six pairs in the side pockets

 "the real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing that he had ever seen and that he had seen some very strange things

 Once dressed, fake Harrys rucksacks and owl cages, carrying a stuffed icy owl from another sack, each
 "moody, but as the last seven said good" Harrys faced dressed, clothed and stuffed
 "the couple will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me by the broom, -"? "why'm with you" Harry grunted near the back door
 "because you're the one that needs to see," Moody growled and sure enough, not his magic eye as he continued to waver from Mundungus, "arthur and Fred -" "the twins said i George i am "was a moody gesture
 "aap bhi hamen bataao alaava jab ham harry nahin ho sakate hai?" "kshamaa karen, - jorge" "main keval apni chadi yanking hoon, main sach main fred rahaa hoon -" ! "paryaapt aasapaas khilwaad" mudi snarled

 "kingsle ke saath miss Granger, phir thestral dwaara -" Hermione ke rup main vah he kingsle muskaan jawaab aashwast lag rahaa tha, pataa tha ki Hermione harry bhi ek naala par vishwaas kami
 "koun sa pattiyaan tum or main! ron" Tonks chamakate ne kaha, ek mag ped ke rup main vah us par laharaaya par dastak de
 Hermione didn't look quite as happy as Ron
 "ek 'kya tum mere saath ho, harry

 "ham bike par hoga, 'ek thestrals jhaadu vajan nahin le sakate hai mujhe, dekho
 is par bahut 'nahin ek o mere saath kii seat par cameraa, haalanki, to aap maadak dravya main ho jayega "
 "harry, nahin puri tarah sachai se kaha ki yah bahut acha he
 Moody, who seemed to think that Harry was feeling, said, "we think you would expect death eaters to be on a broom
" "so, if we can run into any death eaters, Snape has had a lot of time to tell them everything you've ever told him about before, we're a potter who looks at a broomstick at home Bet has been selected
 Okay then, "he went upstairs, this is the way to return the door by tying the sack with the fake 'potter's clothes and the chief," i should let us go for three minutes to make it
 Someone Back door Close point, don't keep devouring this death when they will come out watching
 Come on


 "harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt and Hedwig cage and followed the group back to the dark garden
 har taraf broomsticks par haathon main oochaal the, Hermione par pehle se hi kiya gaya tha madad ke liye ek mahaan kingsle, bill dwaara duusare par Fleur dwaara kaale thestral
 Hagrid motorcycle ke paas taiyaar khadaa tha, par kaale chashme
 "kya yah he? is Sirius bike he? ", Hagrid ne kaha, "bahut hi," harry par neeche muskuraate
 "ek 'pichhali baar ye us par tha, harry, main ek haath main ye feet saktaa he!" harry lekin madad nahin mahasoos kar saktaa tha ek chote se apamaanit rup main vah maadak dravya main mila he
 He was kept and everyone smirked down several feet: Ron sat at his sight like a child in a bumper car
 Harry stuffed his rucksack and sewer down with his feet and rammed the Hedwig cage between his knees
 He was very upset

 " vahaan motorcycle se ek mahaan garjan tha or harry laga maadak dravya ek ganda besahaara de
 He was rising rapidly through the air, a little water from his eyes, his face with whipped hair behind
 Around her broom were also moving upward, the long black tail of a thestral flicked past
 His legs, jammed in Hedwig's cage and the sidecar rucksack by him, were already sore and began to go numb
 So great is his trouble that he almost forgot to take the last four privet drives at a glance of the number
 jab se vah maadak dravya vah ab jo ek yah tha bataa saktaa he ke kinare par dekha kar
 or phir, kahin se bhi baahar kuch nahin ke baahar, ve gher rahe the
 At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, who had risen to members of the middle order, formed a huge circle in oblivion - shrieks, a flame of green light on each side: Hagrid gave a shout and rolled over the motorcycle
 Harry lost any sense of where he was
 uske upar streetlights, uske chaaron ore chillaata he, vah priy jivan ke liye maadak dravya se chipak gaya tha
 Hedwig's cage, Firebolt and his rucksack slipped from under his knee - "- no help!" The brook is also spun, but he just seized his rucksack strap and swung the motorcycle correctly again as top management of the cage
 a second relief and then another burst of green light
 The owl stopped and fell on the floor of the cage
 "- nahin nahin!" motorcycle aage badhkar, harry maut Hagrid ke rup main bikharane bhakshan hooded jhalak unke chakra ke madhyam se visphot
 "hedwig - - Hedwig" lekin ullu karnaa sthir or dayaneey use pinjre ke tal par ek khilonaa ke rup main
 vah use nahin le saktaa he or dusron ke liye apane aatank sarvopari he
 He glanced over his shoulder and saw people moving on a broom flying off into the distance, a mass of flares of green light, two pairs of people, but he couldn't tell who they were - "hagrid, we got to go back Hai, we have to go back! " He shouted at the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling his wand, ramming Hedwig's cage into the floor, refusing to believe that he had died
 "hagrid, turn around!" "my job is terrorism there you are safe, Harry!" Hagrid bellow and he opened the asphyxia
 "- stop stop!" Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of green light blew past his left ear: the four were broken away from the circle devouring death and chasing them, aiming back to Hagrid's wide
 Hagrid swerved, Wriggling aasapaas vah royaa, "chakit!" or apni chadi se prakaash shot ke ek laal bolt, chaar kii maut peechha bhakshan ke bich ek antar cleaving ke rup main ve ise se bachane ke bikhare hue
 "ruko, harry, yah 'ke liye unhen kya karenge!" Hagrid garaje or harry ko sirf dekha eendhan gej ke paas ek hare rang kii batan Hagrid main ek moti ungali band kar dekhne ke samay main
 ek diwaar, ek thos kaale rang kii diwaar ke nikaas pipe baahar bhadak uthi
 uski gardan craning, harry dekha he midair main astitv main vistaar
 teen maut kaa bhakshan swerved or ise bachaa he, lekin chauthe itnaa bhaagyashaalee nahin tha, vah drishy se gaayab ho gai he or phir ise peeche se ek pathar kii tarah gira diya, apane naala tukdon main tut gaya
 One slowed down for his comrades to save him, but they and the aerial wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low on the handlebars and raced
 More killing curses killed the remaining two 'the devouring wands flew past Harry's head and they were targets for Hagrid
 harry aage mantra bahtareen: laal or bahurangi kii bauchhaar sparks main midair main takaraa hare rang ke saath jawaab diya or harry aatishbaajee kii betahasha sochaa tha or neeche Muggles jo pataa nahin kya ho rahaa hoga - "yahan ham phir jaao, harry, ruko!" Hagrid chillaaya or vah ek doosraa batan par jabbed
 is samay ke ek mahaan se net fat ke nikaas len, lekin maut bhakshan iske liye taiyaar the
 Not only that they had to wander to avoid it, but the fellow who was slow to faint save his friend was caught
 vah andhere se baahar achaanak khil or ab un teenon the iske baad sabhi shooting shaap motorcycle, pursuing
 "yah use kas par, harry pakad kar doongaa!" Hagrid chillaaya or harry dekha use bangnee batan par speedometer ke paas apane puure haath slam
 ek achook bellowing garjan ke saath nikaas, safed or nile garm he or motorcycle wrenching dhaatu kaa ek dhwani ke saath ek goli kii tarah aage se goli maar di, dregon aag fat
 harry dekha maut bhakshan drushti se baahar karne ke liye bhatakana lau ke ghaatak nishaan se bachane ke liye or ek hi samay main maadak dravya laga ominously bolbalaa: isaki bike karne ke liye dhaatu conection twaran ke bal ke saath kuchle tha
 "it's all 'righ, Harry!" The bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat on the back by an increase of speed, was no longer steering and the sidecar began to turn violently into the bike's slipstream
 "i'm on it, Harry don ', don't worry!" Hagrid shouted and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his pink floral umbrella
 "nahin! Hagrid! mujhe jane do!" "REPARO!" vahaan ek gaganabhedi dhamaake or maadak dravya puri tarah se kiya gaya tha bike se dur tod diya
 Harry overtake, inspired by the motivation of this bike's flight, then the sidecar began to lose altitude - in desperation Harry lifted his wand into the sidecar and shouted, "wingardium Leviosa!" The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still in Hawaii
 He was, but a second relief divided, though, as more curses streaked past him: Three devouring deaths were closed in
 "i'm coming, Harry!" Hagrid shouted from outside the darkness, but sink again to Harry: Crouching as low as he could, he pointed in between the oncoming figures and shouted, "daddies could feel the beginning of the blockage!" The wretched chest struck mid-death eating, a moment the man had been foolishly-spread eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his comrades almost collided with him - then the narcotic started falling into earnest and the remaining death eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck under the rim of the car, out on the edge of his seat Knock a tooth - "i'm coming, Harry, I'm coming!" a big hand is behind Harry's cloak and hoisted it out of the seized plummeting daddies, Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself to the motorcycle seat and found himself back with the returning Hagrid
 ke rup main ve upar kii ore bad gai, dur se do uske munh se baahar maut bhakshan, harry vivaad rakt shesh, maadak dravya girane main apni chadi uthaai or chillaaya, "confringo!" vah Hedwig ke liye ek bhayanak, aant-wrenching vednaa ke rup main yah pataa tha, maut khaane visphot paas tha apana jhaadu visphot or drushti se gir gaya, uske saathi waapas gir gaya or gaayab ho gaye
 "harry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry", Hagrid moaned, "I tried to repair it meself shouldn'ta terrorism - yeh've got no place -" "it's not a problem, just flying Stay!" Harry shouted back, drawing closer as two more death eaters emerged out of the darkness
 Shooting in curse beach space came again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew as Hagrid dared not use the dragon break button again, sitting so insecure with Harry
 harry bahtareen vartanee waapas apane peechha main chaunkaane ke baad vartanee bheja he, mushkil se unhen pakad se dur
 vah un par ek or avaruddh manahuus shot: maut khaanevaala nikatatam karne ke liye ise se bachane or uske hud phisal swerved or apni agali bahtareen vartanee kii laal batti dwaara, harry stanley Shunpike kii ajeeb rikt cheharaa - sten dekha - "expelliarmus!" harry chillaaya
 "this is it, this is that, this is real!" The hooded death shout of the motorcycle's engine also reached above the rumble of Harry: The next moment, both the chase had fallen back and disappeared from view
 "harry, kya hua he?" bellowed Hagrid
 "ve Where've chali gayi?" "mujhe nahin pataa!" lekin harry dar gaya tha:! Hooded maut khaane chillaaya tha, "yah asli he", vah kaise jaanata tha? vah jahiraa taur par khaali andhere main chaaron ore gazed or uske khatra mahasoos kiya
 where were they? He rode the front seat and seized the back grip of the Hagrid jacket to ride on the all-around seat
 "hagrid, ajgar viraam baat phir se karnaa he, chalo yahan se chale jaao!" "tang ruko, to phir, harry!" vahaan ek gaganabhedi tha, garjan phir rote or safed nile nikaas se aag shot: harry khud ko peeche se dur hota ja rahaa he mahasoos kiya tha ki vah seat ke chote kya
 Hagrid us par daraaj pichde, mushkil se handlebars par apni pakad banaae rakhane - "mujhe lagata he ki ham unhen harry kho diya he, mujhe lagata he ki ham ise kiya he!" Hagrid chillaaya
 But Harry was not convinced, fear stung him as he saw the chase left and right he was sure to come
 
 
 
 kyon ve waapas gir gaya tha? unamem se ek tha abhi bhi ek chadi thi
 
 
 
 it's him
 
 
 yah asli he
 
 
 
 He had said that after this was correct, he tried to steer the arms
 
 
 
 "ham lagbhag vahaan, harry, ham lagbhag kar liya he yah kar rahe hai!" Hagrid chillaaya
 Harry Len felt a small drop, although the lights still on the ground seemed remote as stars
 phir apane maathe par nishaan aag kii tarah jala diya: ke rup main ek maut khaane bike ke donon taraf dikhaai diya, do kii hatya shaap millimeters dwaara harry yaad kiya, peeche se daali - harry or phir use dekha
 Voldemort hawa par dhuen kii tarah ud rahaa tha, naala yaa thestral bina use pakad, apane saanp kii tarah syaahi se baahar gleaming cheharaa, apni safed ungaliyon uski chadi phir se uthaane - Hagrid baahar jane kaa dar bellow or ek urdhwadhar ghota main motorcycle steered
 priy jivan ke liye par pakad, harry chakkardaar raat main yadrichhik par udaan mantra bahtareen bheja he
 He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a blast and saw sparks from the engine, motorcycles spiraled through the air completely out of control, - those last of the light shots Green Jet again
 Harry is not the one who knew the way up, down who: his mark was still burning, he is likely to die on another
 ek naala par ek hooded aankada uske paas se haath kii thi, unhone dekha tha vah apane haath badha - "nahin!" rosh kii ek chillaao Hagrid maut khaane par bike se khud ke saath shuru kiya, uske aatank karne ke liye, harry donon Hagrid or maut khaane ko dekha, girane drushti se baahar hai, unke liye bahut adhik naala sanyukt vajan - mushkil se apane ghutanon ke saath plummeting len utsahit, harry Voldemort cheekh suni meraa, "!" yah khatm ho gaya tha: vah dekh yaa sun nahin saktaa he, jahaan Voldemort tha, vah ek or maut khaane raste se baahar swooping, "or Avada suna jhalak -" harry ke nishaan se dard ke rup main majaboor uski ankhen band, uski chadi apane swayan ke samjhaute kaa kaam kiya
 He felt like some great magnet around his hand, saw a surge of gold fire through his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury
 Shouted the remaining death , Voldemort shouted, "no!" Somehow, Harry got his nose an inch from the dragon break button
 usne apni chadi se mukt haath se mukka maaraa or bike hawa main or adhik aag shot, sidhe jameen kii ore hurtling
 "hagrid!" harry kehete hai, priy jivan ke liye bike par pakade
 "- Hagrid Accio Hagrid!" motorcycle upar ud gaye, prithvi kii disha main chusaa
 handlebars ke saath str cheharaa, harry lekin kuch bhi nahin dur ke paas roshni badhati he or najadik dekhen: vah durghatana ja rahaa tha or vahaan kuch bhi nahin vah iske bare main nahin kar saktaa tha saktaa he
 Another scream followed him, "your stick, Selwyn, give me your stick!" He felt Voldemort before he saw her
 Looking sideways, he stared into red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort would be preparing to curse him once more - and then Voldemort disappeared
 Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread eagled them down to the ground
 He groped for the brake to pull hard on the handlebars to avoid hitting him, but with a thunderous, trembling land crash, he killed in a muddy pond

 'sadqaah yaa sadaq aadhunik sandarbh main "svaichhik daan" kaa sanket diya gaya he
 According to the Quran, the word means voluntary offering, whose wealth is at the will of the "giver"
 arabi shabdaawalee ke anusaar, jad sa da qa se praapt shabd "dharmikata or sachai ke vichaaron ke saath jude kai arth" ko cover karte hai
 In the Quran, the related word is used to describe "moral excellence", such as al-siddiq, the prophet Yusuf, or Sadiq
 duusari ore, aadhunik shodh, athical rup se bhashaaroop shabd ko hebrew anudaana sedaaka se jodne kaa prayaas karen
 Some experts therefore conclude that the word Sadaka is a word derived from another language
 quran ke anusaar, sadaq muhaiyaa karne waalon kii shuddhi main le jaataa he
 The Quran states that Sadaka should not be in any physical form and may be a "voluntary effort" or a type of word
 yah ek kathan ke saath samjhaute main he, jo mohammad ko diya gaya he, jisamen kaha gaya he, "har acha kaam sadaq kaa ek rup he
 "from the Quranic point of view, good words with" insult "and" mercy "are better than Sadaka, and to offer" intelligence "to charity rather than to do it in public to be accepted by the Quran
 He also criticizes donating for the purpose of compromising the value of the benevolent or the benevolent by "demonizing public behavior", "just charitable work in general, purely voluntary
" While doing
 " quran kaa suzav he ki sadaaka kaa matlab keval garibon kaa samarthan karne ke liye nahin he, balki un logon ko bhi daan kiya ja saktaa he jo "jarurat nahin dikh rahe the" or jinke jivan ko badhaane ke liye unhen sahaayta kii zarurat thi yaa jinhen nai naukariyon kii disha main nirdeshit kiya janaa chahie or "aarthik avasar "
 According to some hadiths, "a kind of word and a smile" can be considered as everlasting and its best form is "passing on knowledge"
 " iske alaava, mohammad ne haddees main kaha tha ki sadaaka buraai ke sattar daravaaje ko hataa detaa he
 On some occasions the term is used with zakat and nafaka, however, while zakat is mandatory, sadaqada usually refers to voluntary donations

 The decision to partition Bengal was announced on 19 July 1905 by Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India

 The partition took effect from 16 October 1905

 It was a part of the British "divide - rule" policy
 at: iske virodh main 1908 i
 main sampoorn desh main `bang-bhang' aandolan shuru ho gaya
 The eastern and western parts of Bengal were reunited in 1911 due to pressure from the Indian people on both sides due to high level political unrest caused by this division
 bengal praant kaa kshetrafal 489,500 varg kilometre or jansankhya 8 karod se zyada thi
 East Bengal was geographically and almost isolated from West Bengal due to less communication means
 1836 main, upree praanton ko ek leftinent governor ke shashan ke antargat kar diya gaya or 1854 main governor general-in-council ko bengal ke pratyaksh prashasan se mukt kar diya gaya
 Assam was separated from Bengal, including Sylhet, in 1874 to form a separate chief-commissioner, and later in 1898 Lushai Hills was also included
 bengal jaise bade or itani adhik aabaadi vaale praant kaa prabandhan bahut kathin tha
 The partition of Bengal was first thought in 1903
 chittagong tathaa dhaka or maimansingh ke jilon ko bengal se alag kar assam praant main milaane ke atirikt prastaav bhi rakhe gaye the
 Similarly, Chota Nagpur was also to be merged with the Central Province
 san 1903 main hi congress kaa bhi 19vaan adhiveshan madras main hua tha
 On the same occasion, its Chairman Mr
 Lalmohan Ghosh, in his address criticized the reactionary policy of the government, reported imminent mutilation on an all-india platform
 unhone kaha ki is prakaar kaa ek shadyantr chal rahaa he
 The government officially published the idea in January of 1904 and in February Lord Curzon made official visits to assess the public opinion on the partition in the eastern districts of Bengal
 unhone pramukh hastiyon ke saath paraamarsh kiya or dhaka, chatgaanv tathaa maimansingh main bhaashan dekar vibhaajan par sarkaar ke rukh ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 Henry John Stedman Cotton, who was Chief Commissioner of Assam from 1896 to 1902, opposed the idea
 congress ke agle adhiveshan main sabhapati pad se bolte hue sar henry coton ne bhi yah kaha ki yadi yah bahaanaa he ki itane bade praant ko ek rajyapal sanbhaal nahin saktaa to yaa to bombai or madras kii tarah bengal kaa shashansutra saprishad rajyapal ke sipurd ho yaa banglaa bhashiyon ko alag karke ek praant banaaya jaae
 In those days Bengal province also included Bihar and Orissa
 par british sarkaar ne na to congress kii parvaah kii, na janamat kii
 The then Viceroy and Governor General Lord Curzon tried to convince the people in the Land Holders Association or Zamindar Sabha that vangabhang would only benefit
 vah swayan purv bengal main bhi gaye, par mutthi bhar musalamaanon ke atirikt kisi ne is prastaav kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 The then Nawab of Dhaka, reputed among the Muslims, also opposed it in the first charge
 1905 main 16 oktober ko bharat ke tatkaaleen waisarai lard karjan dwaara bengal kaa vibhaajan kiya gaya
 The division was encouraged for administrative tasks, Bengal being almost as large as France, with a population much larger than France
 aisa sochaa gaya ki purvi kshetra upekshit or uchit rup se shasit nahin tha
 With the division of the province, better administration could be established in the eastern region, so that the people there would ultimately benefit from school and employment opportunities
 haalaanki, vibhaajan kii yojana ke peeche anya uddeshy bhi chhipe the
 Bengali Hindus were pioneers in the political movement for greater participation in governance, so now their position was weakened due to the increase in the dominance of the Muslims in the past
 Both Hindus and Muslims opposed the partition
 After partition, however, an almost anti-british movement prevailed at the national level, including non-violent and violent protests, boycotts and even the assassination of the governor of the new province of West Bengal
 prabal saarvajanik virodh ke baavjood 20 july 1905 ko vangbhang ke prastaav par bharat sachiv kaa thappa lag gaya
 The Rajshahi, Dhaka and Chittagong Commissioners were merged with Assam to form a province, which was named as Poorvang and Assam, and the rest, ie Presidency and Vardhaman Commissioners, Bihar, Udha and some base
 is avasar par hinduon or musalamaanon ko yah kahkar ladaane kii cheshtaa kii gai ki is vibhaajan se musalamaanon ko phayda he kyonki purvavang or assam main unheen kaa bahumat rahegaa
 The Nawab of Dhaka had earlier protested, but he became in his favor when he became disenchanted
 sar jojeff bamfield fuller purvavang or assam ke nae leftinant governor bane
 He is said to have said openly in many places that Hindus and Muslims are his two bibis, of which Muslims are his favorites
 is kathan kaa aashay spasht tha
 Vangabhang was not intended to facilitate administration, as it was claimed, but rather had two clear objectives, one to fight a Hindu Muslim and the other to hurt the newly awakened Bengal
 yadi gaharaai se dekha jaae to yaheen se pakistan kaa bijaropan hua
 One of the resolutions passed in the 1906 session of the Muslim League was also that vangabhang is good for Muslims and those who agitate against it do wrong things and they harm Muslims
 baad ko chalakar lig ke 1908 ke adhiveshan main bhi yah prastaav paarit hua ki congress ne vangbhang ke virodh kaa jo prastaav rakhaa he, vah sweekruti ke yogya nahin
 The new province included the hill states of Tripura, Chittagang Mandal, Dhaka and Rajshahi and the Malda district was merged into Assam province
 bengal ko na keval in bade purvi pradeshon ko chhodana padaa, balki paanch hindi bhashi rajyon ko bhi madhya praant ke liye ganvaana padaa tha
 On the west side, it was awarded Sambalpur and five small Oriya-speaking states from the Central Province
 bengal ke paas141,580 varg mile kshetrafal or paanch karod chalis lakh kii jansankhya hi bachi thi, jisamen chaar karod bees lakh hindu or nabbe lakh muslim the
 The new province was named East Bengal and Assam respectively, with Dhaka, the capital of East Bengal, and Chittagong, the subordinate headquarters of Assam
 iskaa kshetrafal 106,540 varg mile tha or jansankhya teen karod das lakh thi, jisame ek karod assi lakh muslim or ek karod bees lakh hindu the
 There was a Legislative Council and a two-member Revenue Board for administration and the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court was not changed
 sarkaar ne ingit kiya ki purvi bengal or assam ke bich ek sahi dhang se nirdhaarit pashchimi seemaa hogi or suparibhaashit bhugolic, nrikul vigyaani, bhashiya evam saamaajik visheshtaayen hongi
 The Government of India publicized its final decision with the accepted resolution of 19 July 1905 and the partition of Bengal came into force from 16 October of the same year
 1911 main radd kiye jane se purv, vibhaajan bamushkil aadhe dashak tak chal paaya tha
 However, the UK policy behind Partition was Divide et Impera, which continued to influence the reorganized province
 1919 main, musalamaanon or hinduon ke liye alag-alag chunaav vyavastha sthapit kii gayi
 Prior to this, many members of both communities advocated national unity for all Bengalis
 ab, alag-alag samudaayon ne apane-apane rajnatik mudde viksit kar liye
 Muslims also dominated the Legislature on the strength of their overall numerical strength, which ranged between two crore twenty lakh and two crore eight million

 Muslims now wanted to make the entire province a part of the Muslim state, Pakistan
 1947 main bengal duusari baar, is baar dharmik aadhaar par, vibhajit hua
 It became East Pakistan
 haalaanki, 1971 main pashchimi pakistani sainya shashan ke saath ek safal mukti yuddh ke baad purvi pakistan bangladesh naam kaa swatantra rajya ban gaya
 There was bloodshed in both the divisions of Bengal
 isane ek bada raajnneetik sankat paidaa kiya
 Muslims in East Bengal believed that a separate region would provide them more opportunities for education, employment, etc
, whereas the people of West Bengal did not like this partition and a large amount of nationalist literature was produced during this time
 bhartiya rashtriya congress dwaara kiye gaye virodh kaa netritv sar henry jon stedman coton ne kiya jo purv main assam ke mukhya ayukta the, parantu karzan adig rahe
 Later, Cotton, now a liberal MP from East Nottingham, successfully campaigned for the removal of Sir Bemfield Fuller, the first lieutenant-governor of East Bengal
 1906 main rabindranath tagore ne amar shonar bangla kii rachana kii jo bantwaare kaa virodh karne waalon kaa raily naaraa tha, vah kaaphi baad, 1972 main bangladesh kaa raashtragan ban gaya
 Due to these political protests, both parts of Bengal were reunited in 1911

 Simultaneously, the administrative capital of British India was moved from Calcutta to New Delhi

 The government may not even know whether to get that revenue from tobacco, this is true, but it is also true that the revenue spent on the treatment of tobacco-borne diseases is much less than that
 sabase badi baat to yah he ki tambaaku ke seven se jeevani shakti kaa bhi hraas hota he
 The person comes to know that the consumption of tobacco is harmful, but even after the release of lac, this addiction does not stop
 so dhire-dhire usamen jeevani shakti bhi kam hoti jaati he or vah apane aapako ek tarah se vinaash ke hawaale bhi kar detaa he
 It is well known that tobacco is misused as a cigarette throughout the world

 People who consume it again and again, their body becomes addicted to this drug and then they cannot leave it

 Due to this, people become addicted to it, in the same way as people get addicted to alcohol or other substances and when someone becomes addicted to something, then their regular intake becomes a compulsion

 There are two types of abhangas - four stages and two steps
 The first three stages of a four-step abridge have 6-6 characters and the last phase has four letters
 Simultaneously there is a put of pun in the second and third stages

 aavart sarini main rasinic tatva parmaanu kramank ke badhate kram main sajaaye gayi hai tathaa aavart, praathmik samooh, dwitiyak samooh main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 The current periodic table contains 118 known elements
 sabase pehle roosi rasayan-shastri mendlif ne san 1869 main aavart niyam prastut kiya or tatwon ko ek sarini ke rup main prastut kiya
 a few months later, German scientist Lothar Meyer also independently created the periodic table
 mendeleyev kii sarini se alfred varnor ne aavart sarini kaa vartmaan swaroop nirmit kiya
 In 1952, Costa Rica scientist Gil Chaveri introduced a new form of the periodic table that was based on the electronic structure of elements
 rasayan shastriyon ke liye aavart sarini atyant mahatvapurn evam upyogi he
 Because of this, memorizing only the properties of lesser elements works because the properties in a group or a period in the periodic table change in a certain order and in a rational way
 neeche aavart sarini kaa aadhunik rup dikhaaya gaya he jisamen 18 varg tathaa 7 aavart hai- Lanthanide and actinide have been kept separate from other metals in this prevailing arrangement of the periodic table
 vistrut or ati-vistrut aavart saranion main f-block or g-block dhaatuon ko bhi ek saath prabandhit kiya jaataa he
 Categories of elements in the periodic table tatwon ke parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhi kram main krambaddh karne par kshaitij kataren praapt hoti hai jinhen 'aavart' kehete hai
 According to the periodic law, when the elements are decorated in horizontal lines in increasing order of atomic weight, the elements having salmon properties are present in the same vertical column, these are called 'squares'
 aavart sarini ke urdhv kataron ko 'samooh' yaa 'varg' kaha jaataa he
 Groups are considered to be the most important in terms of classification of elements
 kuch samoohon main, tatv samaan gun darshaate hai
 These groups are named alkaline elements, alkaline earth metals, halogen, nictogen, chalcogen and inert gas
 aavart sarini ke kshaitij kataron ko aavart kehete hai
 Although groups are considered to be more important in the classification of elements, then there are many sites in the periodic table where the importance of periodic becomes greater
 udhaaharan ke rup main di-block yaa sankraman dhaatuon or epa-block ko liya ja saktaa he
 Modern periodic table is also called long form of periodic table
 isamen 18 varg tathaa 7 aavart hai
 Atoms of all elements of a single class have the same number of electrons in the outermost orbit
 is kaaran kisi ek varg ke sabhi tatwon ke mukhya gun samaan hote hai
 On the basis of valence electrons, the elements are divided into 4 sections - s, p, d, f
 sabase pehle roosi rasayan-shastri mendlif ne san 1869 main aavart niyam prastut kiya or tatwon ko ek sarini ke rup main prastut kiya
 according to this, arthath yadi tatwon ko parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhikram main rakhaa jaay to wo tatv jinke gun samaan hote hai ek nishchit avadhi ke baad aate hai
 Mendeleev tried to demonstrate the aspect of recurring physical and chemical properties of elements with the help of this table
 mandelif kii aavart sarini main kul 8 varg the kyonki us samay niskriy gaison kii khoj nahin hui thi
 Later the 9th class was included in the modern periodic table after the discovery of inert gases
 is 9wein varg ko 0 kehete hai
 Classes one through eighth are represented by the Roman letters I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII
 nawein varg ko 0 dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 In the last phase of its development, scientists like Raga, Werner, Bohr and Bari created the modern form of the periodic table which is in practice till the present
 inhone mendelive kii aavart sarini main upasthit shreniyon ko khatm kiya tathaa virgo kii sankhya ko 9 se badhaakar 18 kiya
 Even after this, the two main drawbacks so far are the presence of hydrogen in two places and the absence of lanthanide and actinide elements in the table
 madlif dwaara aavart sarini prastut karne ke kuch maheenon baad german vaigyanik lother meyar ne bhi swatantra rup se aavart sarini kaa nirmaan kiya
 From 1815 to 1913, it underwent a lot of reforms so that the newly invented elements could be given proper place and the table should be in accordance with the new information
