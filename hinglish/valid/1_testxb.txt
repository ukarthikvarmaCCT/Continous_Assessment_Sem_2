 Its action is dependent on the voyeurism
 hamaari aankh ke krishnapatal par kisi vastu kaa pratibimb vastu ko hataa lene ke lagbhag 1 / 16 second se lekar 1 / 10 second baad tak bana rahata he
 a simple frequency view consists of a circular letter or circle, in which holes are formed in one or two three circular rows at equal distances near the turn
 vrittakar patr ko ek chaal se ghumaya jaataa he or chhidron ke sameep aankh vrittakar patr ko ek chaal se ghumaya jaataa he or chhidron ke sameep aankh lagaakar gatiman vastu kaa nirikshan kiya jaataa he
 The object becomes visible only when the hole is exposed to the object

 The machine must remain in very bright light for clear inspection
 yadi ekasmaan teevr prakaash ke badale mashin ko prakaash main rahanaa chahie
 If the machine is illuminated by intense light instead of uniform fast light, and if the frequency of the fire is high enough that one of the sparks falls on exactly one of the revolutions on the machine, then the machine will look stable
 is aayojan se mashin ke kisi bhaag ke kisi bhaag ko photo liya ja saktaa he, uskaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he or mashin kaa koniya veg gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The frequency number of a oscillating object, such as a staggered oscillator, can also be derived
 aavritidarshi aa ko vidyut motor mo dwaara ghumaya jaataa he
 The number of revolutions of the frequency can be corrected by increasing the speed of the motor at will and the value of the revolver can be determined from the counter mounted on the axis of the motor

 In this way the hole between the leaves opens and closes in a second as often as the vocal frequency
 iske baad aavritidarshi ko chalaakar swaritra ko vidyut dwaara dolit karte hai
 Due to the effect of electricity, oscillation of the oscillator remains permanent
 doordarshee main aavritidarshi ke chhidr pehle dhundhale, phir motor kii gati badhane ke saath falkar purna vrittakar ho jate hai
 As the speed increases, the holes are clearly visible
 yah tabhi sambhav hota he jab swaritra ke dolankaal main aavritidarshi kaa ek chhidr nikatavarti duusare chhidr ke sthaan par ghumkar aa jaataa he
 If the speed of the cycle is reduced a little, then the holes appear to be moving slowly backwards and if the speed is increased a little, then the holes seem to move slowly in the forward direction
 jab chhidr spasht sthir dikhaai padate hai to aavritidarshi kii bhramansankhya dekhakar swaritra kii aavritisankhya gyaat kii ja sakati he
 If there are a number of holes on the circle of the circle and the circle rotates in one second, then the frequency of the oscillator is less
 aavritidarshi kii gati isaki thik duni athwa tiguni, chauguni ityadi hone par bhi chhidr isi prakaar sthir dikhaai padate hai
 For this reason, the speed of the oscillator in the experiment is initially increased slowly by keeping it low

 That is, the blades appear to be moving upright and stopping in between

 If f make only one round in the same direction in one second and according to the picture, if the first glow is on circle 1, then the two points of this circle will appear just below each other
 duusari damak ke pahonchte hi vrutt 1 ke sthaan par vrutt 2 aa jayega or bindu dakshinavart disha main mude jaan padenge
 As soon as the third moment comes, circle 3 will come in place of circle 1 and the points will appear more bent
 vrutt sab ek samaan hai or sab baari se sthaan 1 par aate hai, jahaan prakaash kii damaken padati hai
 Therefore, the circles will appear stationary and their inner points rotate clockwise
 patr c ke centre ke sameep teen khaanedaar vrutt banaae gaye hai, jinamein ekantar kram se safed kaale khaane bane hue hai
 The intermediate circle has 13 white and 13 black fields
 bhitari vrutt main 12 safed or 12 kaale khaane hai or bahari vrutt main prayek prakaar ke 14 aise khaane hai
 At such a balance of the relative speeds of both the letters f and a, that the circumference circles appear to be stationary, the middle circle in these three central column circles will appear to be stationary, outer clockwise and inner counterclockwise

 Such glitter is caused by the blindness of our eyes, as by putting pictures on the screen of the cinema more than 13 times per second, we can naturally see all the activities of the characters, dancing, running, etc
 yadi chalchitron kii sankhya prati second 13 se kam ho to parde par kanpakanpi aane lagati he

 But beyond the understanding of Hermes's flight director Mitch Henderson, NASA director Taddy Senders decides that he will not inform the rest of the members of Aris III of Watney's survival, otherwise he will risk himself by deviating from the mission 
 vaatani, rover par savaar hokar pethfinder praab dhund nikaalata he, jise 1997 ke baad se niskriy kar diya gaya tha
 With the help of the lander's rotating still camera, the connections between Watney and the JPL team are now under way for the basic dialogue
 nasa team kii nirdeshon par vaatani ab pethfinder ko rawar se link ap karata he, taaki ve log tip texd sandeshon main aapasi samvaad rakh saken
 Watney is extremely upset that the team has not been informed of his survival, and then Henderson sends this information to the team, with Sanders' permission

 For this, by sending the necessary supplies through the Chinese booster along with the Hermes, you can remove it in space for another 18 months
 lekin sanders ise sire se khaarij karte hai, kyonki vah harmis ke sadsy kisi jokhim main nahin daal sakate, lekin henderson gupachup rup se yah jaankaree harmis tak bhej dete hai
 Commander Lewis and his crew unanimously decide on the choice of this rescue plan, and, against nasa's rules - ship the goods on the Hermes and orbit the Earth's gravitational force on its orbit and leave for Mars

 At the same time Philip waged war against Bezantium, leaving Alexander in charge of the kingdom
 philip kii anupasthiti ke dauraan, thresian maidi ne macidonia ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Alexander immediately launched a campaign against him and drove him out of his territory

 Meanwhile, Illyrias invaded Macedonia, which Alexander drove back

 Philip then returned to Ilesia, from where he sent a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, which were both rejected
 philip ne dakshin kii ore kooch kii, jahaan uske virodhiyon ne use cheronia, boesia ke paas roak liya
 For the Battle of Charonia, Philip ordered the right line and Alexander with a group of Philip's trusted generals to take over the left line
 pracheen sroton ke anusaar, donon paksh main kuch samay ke liye bhanyakar ladaai hui
 Philip deliberately ordered his troops to retreat, so that the Athenian soldiers could chase and break away from their security line, and they could penetrate it

 After the victory in Charonia, Philip and Alexander proceeded unopposed to the Peloponnese where they were welcomed by all the cities; However, when they reached Sparta, they were rejected there, but Philip did not resort to war
 kurinth main, philip ne "helinics elliance" kii sthapana kii, jisamen sparta ko chhodkar adhikansh greek shahar-rajya shaamil the

 jab philip pela waapas laut aayaa, to use apane senapati atlus kii bhatiji cleopetra iridiis se pyaar ho gaya or usase vivaah kar liya
 This marriage led to Alexander's claim as heir, as the son born to Cleopatra Irides would have been a complete Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half Macedonian
 vivaah ke bhoj ke dauraan, sharaab ke nashe main atalus ne saarvajanik taur par devataaon se prarthana kii, ki ab macedoniyaan main ek vaid uttaradhikari kaa janm hoga

 Despite being defeated in a battle with Alexander a few years ago, he welcomed Alexander as a guest
 haalanki, aisa prathit hota he ki philip ne kabhi bhi apane raajnneetijna or sainya prashikshit bete ko asweekaar nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Accordingly, Alexander returns to Macedonia after six months due to the efforts of Demratus, a family friend
 agle varsh main, pixodaras, kaaria ke farsi governor ne apni sabase badi beti ko sikandar ke sautele bhai, philip arhidiyas se vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Olympius and many of Alexander's friends suggest that Philip intended to make Erhidius his successor
 sikandar ne pixelrus ko ek doot thisslus ko bhej yah batalaai ki use apni beti kaa haath avaidh bete ko dene ke bajaay sikandar ko dena chaiye
 When Philip heard of this, he stopped the offer negotiations and shouted out to Alexander that he wanted to marry Kyu Pixodarus' daughter, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him
 philip ne sikandar ke chaar mitron harpalus, narkus, tolmi or arygiyas ko nirvasit kar diya, or korinthiens ko thisslus ko zanjeeron main laane ke liye bhej diya
 In the summer of 336 BCE, Philip is assassinated by his bodyguard captain, Posnis, while attending the marriage of his daughter Cleopatra in Ayge
 jab posnis bhaagane kaa prayaas kiya, to sikandar ke do saathi, perdicus or leonatas ne uskaa peechha kar use maar daalaa
 At the same time, at the age of 20, Alexander was declared king by the nobles and the army
 singhaasana sambhalate hi sikandar apane pratidwandviyon ko khatm karne laga
 He started by killing his cousin, the former Amintus Fourth
 usne lancastis kshetra ke do macedonian rajkumaron ko bhi maar diya, halanki tisare, alexander lancastis ko chhod diya
 Olympus burned Cleopatra Iridis and Europa, Philip's daughter, alive

 Alexander also ordered the assassination of Atalus, Cleopatra's uncle and advance commander of the Army of Asia campaign
 atlus us samay athens main apane dosharahit hone kii sambhaavna ke bare main demothens se baatcheet karne gaya tha
 Atalus had insulted Alexander several times, and after Cleopatra's murder, Alexander considered it too dangerous to leave him alive
 sikandar ne arhidiyas ko chhod diya, joki sambhawatah olympiyas dwaara jehar dene ke parinamswaroop, maansik rup se viklang ho chukaa tha
 The news of Philip's death led to rebellions in several states, including Thebes, Athens, Thistle and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon
 jab vidroh kii khabar sikandar tak pahunchi, to usne turant us par dhyaan diya
 Instead of using diplomacy, Alexander marched south towards Thistley, forming a 3,000 Macedonian cavalry
 usne paaya kii thisli kii sena, olympius parvat or osa parvat ke bich ke raste par kabja kiye hue he, usne apni sena ko osa parvat par chadhane kaa aadesh diya
 The next day, when the Thistlean army awoke, Alexander found himself standing behind him with his army, and they immediately surrendered
 sikandar ne unki ghudsavaar sena ko apni main mila kar dakshin main pelloponis kii ore kooch karne laga
 Alexander halted at Thermopile, where he was chosen as the leader of the Amphictyonic League, then proceeded south from there to Corinth
 athens ne shanti ke liye guhaar lagaai, jise sikandar ne maan liya or vidrohiyon ko maaf kar diya
 The famous meeting between Alexander and Diogenes Diogenes the Scenic took place in Corinth
 jab sikandar ne diogens se poocha ki vah unke liye kya kar saktaa he, to darshanik ne ghrinaapurvak se sikandar ko ek taraf khadaa hone ke liye kaha, kyonki vah surya ke prakaash ko avaruddh kar rahaa tha
 Alexander was amused by this spot-on answer, and he said, "if i hadn't been Alexander, i wanted to be Diogenes"
 corinth main, jaise philip ko faras ke khilaaf aane vaale yuddh ke liye commander niyukt kiya gaya tha vaise hi sikandar ko hegaman kaa sheershak diya gaya
 Here he also received news of the Thracian rebellion
 asia ko paar karne se pehle, sikandar apni uttari simaaon ko surakshit karnaa chahta tha
 In the spring of 335 BC, he set out to suppress several rebellions
 ampipolis se shuru hokar, vah "swatantra thresian" ke desh main purv kii ore yatra karata rahaa; or hemas parvat par, macedonian sena ne thresian senaaon ko oonchaaiyon par bhi hamalaa kar parajeet kiya

 He turned to Illyria in the west, after Alexander defeated them one by one, forcing both rulers to flee with his Saina
 in jeeton ke saath hi, usne apni uttari seemaa ko surakshit kar liya tha
 While Alexander was on his north expedition, he was informed of the rebellion of Thebes and the Athenian once again and Alexander immediately marched south
 jabaki anya shahar sikandar se takaraane main jhijak rahe the, thibs ne ladaai karne kaa faisla kiya
 Thebes' resistance was ineffective, and Alexander overtook them and annexed the city and divided the region among other Bootian cities
 thibs ke ant ne athens ko chup kar diya or asthaayee taur par hi sahi, saare yunaan par shanti aa gai
 Alexander then left his Asian campaign, leaving Antipiter as regent

 He invited all the chiefs of Gandhara, and asked them to take his jurisdiction under Alexander

 Alexander divided his army, and Ambi helped Hephaestion and Pedricus to build the bridge over the Indus River, as well as supplying food to his soldiers
 usne sikandar or uski puri sena kaa uski rajdhani takshashila shahar main dosti kaa sabase bada pradarshan karte hue sabase udaar aatithy ke saath swaagat kiya
 As Alexander advanced, Taxila took part in the Battle of the Jhelum River, with the help of an army of 5,000 of his men

 However, the two rivals were then reconciled by Alexander to personal mediation; And Takshashila, due to the contribution of equipment and forces to the fleet on the Jhelum, Ambi was assigned the entire area between the Jhelum River and the Indus; He gained more power after the death of Machatus' son Philip; After Alexander's death and subsequent partition of the provinces in Triparadisus in 321 BCE, he was allowed to retain his authority
 327 / 326 isa purv kii sardeeyon main, sikandar ne kunar ghaatiyon kii aspisioi, guruis ghati ke gurani, or swat or buner ghaatiyon ke asenki jaise kshetreey kabilon ke khilaaf ek abhiyaan chalaaya

 curtius ke anusaar, "na keval alexander ne massaga kii puri aabaadi ko maar daalaa, balki uske sabhi imaaraton ko malbe main badal diya
 "A similar massacre was also carried out in Ora
 massaga or ora ke baad, kai assensian arons ke kile main bhaag gaye
 Alexander followed them and after four days of bloody fighting captured this strategic hill-fort

 Both water and air can be considered perfect liquids
 kam vegavaale vayupravah ke vayugativigyaan ke ganitiya siddhant praaia: dravgati vigyaan jaise hai
 The solution to the problems of aerodynamics is found by adding the extra viscosity to the solution obtained on the recognition of the perfect liquid
 shyaan taralon ke vayugativigyaan main sarvaadhik mahattawala siddhant parisima str siddhant he, jiske aadhaar par vaayu main gatiman pind main tvak-gharshan-karsh kii vyakhya di jaati he
 When the velocity of a moving body in air is close to, or even exceeds, the velocity of sound, the effect of changes in density and temperature becomes important in the interpretation of pressures acting on the body
 tab taral ko asampidya nahin mana ja saktaa or daab, ghanatv tathaa taap ke parsparik sambandh kaa gyaat hona aavashyak he
 The practical application of aerodynamics of compressive flow is in the external interpolation of projections and in the flight-technology of high-speed aircraft or propellants
 iskaa upyog shakti-sanyantr kii dizine main, vaashp tarabine tathaa gas tarabine or jet-nodan ekakonvaale pravaah ke adhyayan main kiya gaya he
 The ratio of Pindweg and terrestrial soundweg is called make number
 chunki kisi taral main dhwaniveg taralaghnatv ke saapeksh daab parivartan dar kii maap he, mek sankhya m taral kii sampidyata kaa suchak he
 It can be proved that if M> 1, that is, the area between the tund, duct, or stream lines in the transcendental current, should increase with acceleration
 iske vipareet sthiti avadhvanik pravaah ke liye he
 Such motion of a liquid, in which the velocity and direction do not change with time, is called the steady flow, otherwise it is called variable flow
 dolyman pakshak athwa sthir kund pind ke pechhevaala pravaah parivarti hota he
 Most of the problems dealt with in aerodynamics are irreversible flow
 pravaah ko ekavim, dwivim yaa trivim is baat ke anusaar kehete hai ki usamen veg, ghanatv or daab keval ek, do yaa teen akashacharon ke falan hai
 The design of wind tunnel is the application of a Vim flow principle
 dwivim arthath samtal pravaah main gati rekhaayen, arthath dhara rekhaayen, yaa to ek hi samtal main hongi yaa samaantar samatalon main hongi or tab in samatalon main gati tatsam hogi
 The flow from the sides with infinite expansion is two-dimensional, as the corresponding flow will be found at the transverse sections of the sides
 yadi pakshak simit vistaar kaa ho, to trivim pravaah praapt hota he
 When the velocity is so low that air can be considered as compressible like fluid, the flow is called incompressible flow
 veg kii drushti se pravaah ko avadhvanik, transdhvanik, paradhvanik, yaa atidhvanik, is tathy ke anusaar kehete hai ki pravahveg dhwaniveg se kam, uske nikat, usase adhik, yaa usase kahin adhik he
 The velocity of the body pressure signals is obtained from the soundwave, by decreasing its velocity relative to the forward body, or by adding its velocity relative to the posterior body
 kalantar pind ke saapeksh uske veg ko jod dene par, praapt hota he
 In time, the signals reach all the points of the sky
 atyant nune avadhvanik vegon par dabasanketon kaa sancharan sabhi dishaao main samamit hota he or yadi dabasanketon kaa veg anant mana ja sake, to avadhvanik pravaah asampidya pravaah jaisaa ho jaataa he
 In supersonic flow the pressure signals are unable to move forward and the disturbance at a particular point is confined within the "make" cone in the downstream direction
 jaisaa ki karmaa ne siddh kiya he, atidhvanik pravaah kaa vayugati-vigyaan kai baton main newton ke kanikawaad se mail khaataa he
 The development of rocket flight inspired the study of supersonic flow
 is adhyayan main shankaviya pravaah ke, jisamen ek mul bindugami trigyon ke anudish taral gun aparivartit rahete hai, anekon anuprayog hai
 The aerodynamics of extremely sparse gases has been termed as atomology, because the gas's free path is no longer negligible compared to the expansion of the body
 vayugativigyaan sambandhi ghatnaon ko ganitiya praturup dwaara nirupit karne kaa pehla dhyey yah jaananaa hota he ki pind par daab kis prakaar vitarit he or uske kaaran vayuyan ke bahya or aantarik prishthon par kya parinami bal or ghurna kriyavant hai, jisase unhen samuchit dridhtaa kaa banaaya ja sake
 Secondly, to find the type of airflow on one part of the aircraft, so that its effect can be studied on other organs like the tail
 vaayu jaise alp-shyaan taral ke gatisameekaran ban to jate hai, kintu saamanyatya ve hal nahin ho pate
 Therefore results are obtained by experimenting in aeronautics; But experimenting on whole-scale objects is extremely expensive and laborious

 If the renold number of a flow is small, that speed will have a significant effect on viscosity and will give a flow like sire, or heavy oil

 The azo compound is an organic compound that has a RN = NR 'group that can contain r and R' aryl or alkyl
 'aijo' shabd francisi bhashaa ke 'ajot' se aayaa he jiskaa arth nitrogen he
 Azo-benzene is the simplest azo compound
 yah nitrobenzin ko jasta or kshar, sodium paarad mishradhatu or tanu alcohal yaa kshareey stans hydroxide vilyan se avakrut karne par banataa he: On heating equal amounts of aromatic primary amine and nitroso compounds with concentrated acetic acid, azo compounds are formed and water is released: azo yogic adhikanshat: daai azonium lavan ko primary, secondary or tershiri amin, finol yaa fanolic aster se jodakar banaae jate hai
 In this activity, the first di-azonium salts react with primary and secondary aromatic amines to form di-azoamino compounds: daai-azoamino yogic banane ke liye kam khanij amla kii upasthiti main anillin kshar par nitras amla kii abhikriya karai jaati he
 The di-azoamino compounds are yellow-colored alkaline compounds that combine with acids, but also form salts of copper, silver, and potassium, in which this hydrogen bonded to nitrogen is of a moving nature and it differs from one nitrogen atom to another
 Can go to the atom
 iskaa pramaan yah he ki yadi finol azonium lavan ko toludin se joda jaae yaa tolil daai-azonium lavan ko aneleen se joda jaae to donon dasha main ek hi yogic banataa he, anyathaa pehle sanyog main sutara kaa yogic banataa or duusare sanyog main sutara kaa yogic praapt hota: Contains the formula of a real compound in which the more affluent organic tolyl is associated with the basic amino group
 carbonic kshar ko hydrochloride ke saath garam karne par yaa adhik khanij amla kii upasthiti main daai-ezoamino yogic amino-azo yogic main parivartit ho jate hai
 This change occurs from the mercury position, but if a radical is present here, this exchange is from the ortho position
 is kriya dwaara bahut se amino azo ranjak banaae jate hai
 Tertiary aromatic amines bind to di-azonium salts and form amino-azo-compounds directly, with the azo group attached to the mercury location of the tertiary amino group
 daai-anzonium lavan freenol ke kshareey vilyan se sanyog karne par hydraxi azo yogic banate hai
 In this action, di-azoxide is often formed
 finolic aster kii daai-anzonium lavan se judane kii shakti amin or finol se kam he
 For this action, it is necessary that the action be performed in anhydrous state
 isliye praaia: yah kriya sandra aseetic amla main kii jaati he
 Dy-azonium compounds of nitroaniline combine with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as butadiene, and mycetylene
 misitelin, prikramide ke daai-azonium lavan se sanyog karata he or ek azoranjak banaata he
 The combination of di-azonium salts with napthol and naphthalene is particularly important
 elphra-napthol hydraxi samooh ke paara sthaan se judata he, parantu yadi is sthaan par koi samooh upasthit hua to yah sanyog ortho sthaan se hota he
 In beta-naphthol, azo-radical occupies 1 position
 beta-napthil amin main bhi isi prakaar kaa sanyog hota he
 The di-azo-ammonium salt binds to the hydroxy group in the alkaline solution from the amino-hydroxy-amine, but in the acidic solution it combines with the amino group
 is tarah ek hi amino-napthol se vilyan ko kshareey yaa amleey karke vibhinn prakaar ke ranjak banaae ja sakate hai: In principle, there must be two isomeric forms of sis, trans, and azo compounds
 is prakaar ke samaavayavon par abhi adhik khoj nahin hui he
 On shedding light on Transaizo benzene it transforms into sis-form
 sis samaavyavi kaa vartanaank or avasorana gunank trans samaavyavi se bhinn he
 a state of equilibrium is created by the effect of light, with about 27 percent being sis- and 73 percent trans-isomeric
 azo ranjak do prakaar ke hote hai
 One is called alkaline dyes and the other is acidic dyes

 Ethylene has a double bond between two carbons, in acetylene the triple bonded compounds are temporary
 ye aasaani se oxikrut evam hellojanikrut ho sakate hai
 Many derivatives of hydrocarbons can be prepared, which have diverse uses
 aise vyutpann chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohal, sodium alcoxide, amin, maracaptain, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate tathaa hydrogen sulphate hai
 Unsaturated hydrocarbons are more active and combine with many reactants to form a readily derived derivative

 is avasthaa ko moragan 'savejri' kaa naam detaa he jabaki puraanon main ise 'krit yug' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Although the pictures of the pre-natural state are different from each other in details, four basic features of this state are clearly visible
 ek to yah ki sabase praarambhik kaal main jivan nirvaah kaa saadhan vrikshon se praapt fal-phool the
 Kalpavriksha is described in many episodes as the main source of living in Brahmin and Jain rituals
 buddha anushrutiyon main jeevananirvaah ke adikalin sroton main vanlata or bhutiparpatak ke naam aae hai
 It is only natural that in the primitive state of human life, which generally corresponds with the Kriyuga described in the Puranas and epics, man must have lived not as a food-producer, but as a food-collector
 is baat kaa samarthan maanav vigyaan se hota he, or yahi baat purapashan kaaleen maanav ke saath bhi lagu hoti he
 In Margan's words, 'subsistence on the natural diet of fruits and flowers originating in a limited area', was the first means of livelihood of man
 us samay koi bhi aisa nahin soch saktaa tha ki fal or vriksh ekmaatr usee ke hai
 This was the nature, when the greed to keep it was hardly born in them, because then this thing was often not there
 parigrah kii jo pravriti aaj maanavaman main sarvopari shakti ke rup main chai hui he use puure oj ke saath viksit karne kaa kaam tab sabhyataa ke sudur anaagat charan ke liye chhod diya gaya tha
 Secondly, there was probably no institution like family based on male suzerainty over women
 prakritik avasthaa ke bare main jitani bhi anushrutiyaan he unamem mahabharat ko chhodkar or kisi main us ek vivaahi parivaar kii utpatti kaa koi spasht sanket nahin miltaa jisamen pita kaa sthaan sarvopari ho or saare gharelu kaaryaklap kaa centre patni ho
 The Shantiparva states that 'the family of a householder full of sons and grandsons, daughters-in-law and servants is void in the absence of Grihshini
 ghar tab tak ghar nahin hota he jab tak usamen patni nahin aati hai
 'but how did such a family emerge? In the epics of the epics and the Puranas, it has been said that earlier the state of free sex existed and that children could be produced only through sankalpa
 krityuga main na to maithun tha or na sweekrut ek-vivaahi pratha thi
 Shantiparva mentions that there was no institution like marriage in the country of Uttarkuru
 kuru desh ke bare main dirghanikaay ke ‘atania-sutt’ main kaha gaya he : ‘yahan aise log rahete hai jo na to kisi bhi vastu ko apana kehete hai or na kisi stri ko apni sampatti
 The third thing is that it is clearly stated in the Puranas that there was no Varna in Kritayuga
 maanav jati kii sabase praarambhik jivanavastha kaa varnan karte hue buddha sroton main bhi aisa ullekh kahin nahin kiya gaya he ki log saamaajik shreniyon main vibhakt the
 Fourthly, it is clear from the statements of 'shantiparva' that there was no institution called Rajya in the early pasture of the natural state
 kautilya ke anusaar vairajya kahe jane vaale kuch deshon main rajpad nahin tha or iske log apana paraayaa nahin jaanate the
 This implies that when there was no private property, there was no king
 haal tak maujuud aadim samaajon ko dekhne se pataa chalata he ki maanav jivan kii sabase purakalin avasthaa main sampatti, parivaar or varg jaisi sansthaaon kaa astitv shaayad hi mili
 It was no coincidence that according to ancient texts, the above mentioned institutions were lacking

 bajirao dwitiya, san 1796 se 1818 tak maratha samrajya ke peshwa the
 During his time the Maratha Empire began to decline
 inke shasankaal main angrejon ke saath sangharsh shuru hua
 Bajirao II was the eighth and last Peshwa
 vah raghunatharav kaa putr tha
 Bajirao II always hated his Prime Minister Nana Fadnavis
 naanaa fadanvis kii mrityu ke baad vah swayan hi maratha samrajya kii satta sambhaalanaa chahta tha
 Bajirao II was a queer and treacherous man, who obtained the rank of Peshwa with the help of the British
 parantu angrezon ke saath bhi vah sachcha siddh nahin hua
 Due to his deception and dishonesty, the British sent him captive to Bithoor, where he died in 1853 AD
 bajirao dwitiya ne angrezon se mitrataa karke unki sahaayta se 'peshwa' kaa pad praapt kiya tha or uske liye kai maratha kshetra angrezon ko de diye
 Bajirao II was a selfish and inept ruler and, being ambitious, was jealous of his prime minister Nana Fadnavis
 fadanvis kii mrityu 1800 i
 main ho gai or bajirao swayan hi satta sambhaalane ke liye aatur ho uthaa
 But he was devoid of military virtues and queer personally and believed that only through deceit could be achieved his goal
 naanaa fadanvis kii mrityu ke baad uske rikt pad ke liye daulataraav shinde or jaswantraav holkar main pratidwandvita shuru ho gai
 Bajirao II wanted to keep these two under his control by deceit, which further complicated the matter
 shinde or holkar ne peshwa ko apane niyantran main lene ke liye puna ke phatakon ke baahar yuddh shuru kar diya
 Bajirao II supported Shinde, but Holkar's army defeated the combined forces of both of them
 bhaybheet peshwa bajirao dwitiya ne 1801 i
 main basai bhagkar angrezon kii sharan lee or vahiin ek angrezi jahaaz par basai kii sandhi, 31 disambar, 1802 par hastakshar kar diye
 By this he accepted to be a dependent of the East India Company
 angrezon ne bajirao dwitiya ko rajdhani puna main pun: sattashin karne kaa vachan diya or peshwa kii raksha ke liye usne rajya main paryaapt sena rakhane kii zimmedaari lee
 In return, the Peshwa agreed to give so much Maratha territory to the company, which brought the expenses of the company's army
 usne yah bhi vaayada kiya ki vah apane yahan angrezon se shatruta rakhane vaale anya europea desh ke logon ko naukari par nahin rakhega
 Thus, Bajirao II sold his freedom to the British for his protection
 maratha saradaaron ne basai kii sandhi ke prati apana rosh prakat kiya, kyonki unhen laga ki peshwa ne apni kaayarata ke kaaran un sabhi kii swatantraaa bech di he
 So they prepared for war to end this objectionable treaty
 parinamswaroop dwitiya angl-maratha yuddh hua, jisamen angrezon kii jeet hui or maratha kshetron par unki prabhusatta sthapit ho gai
 Peshwa Bajirao did not like the restrictions imposed by the treaty
 usne maratha saradaaron main vyaapt rosh or asantosh kaa faaydaa uthaakar unhen angrezon ke viruddh dubaara sangathit kiya
 In November 1817, the organized Maratha army under the leadership of Bajirao II looted the 'english Residency' of Poona and attacked the English army at Khadki position, but was defeated
 tadnantar vah do or ladaaiyon - 1 janvari 1818 main bhima koregaon kii ladai, jisame angrejo ne apni sena ,jo sankhya main maratha se kam the ,jinamein 500 mahaar sainik bhi the, ne peshwa ke 27,000 maratha sainikon ko parajeet kiya tha or ek maheene ke baad ashti kii ladaai main parajeet hua
 He tried to escape, but on 3 June 1818, he had to surrender to the British
 angrezon ne is baar peshwa kaa pad hi samaapt kar diya or bajirao dwitiya ko apdasth karke bandi ke rup main kanpur ke nikat bithur bhej diya jahaan 1853 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Bajirao II was most responsible for destroying the freedom of Marathas
