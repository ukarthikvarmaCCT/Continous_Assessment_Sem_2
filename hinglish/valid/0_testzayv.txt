 When the Mughal king Akbar conquered Kashmir through deception / betrayal and exiled Yusuf Shah Chak, Habba Khatoon spent the rest of his life wandering in the valley singing his songs
 bhale hi jeevani ke bare main kuch vivaad ho, phir bhi unke naam se jude granth kashmir main vyapak rup se lokapriy hai

 She has a deep presence in the oral tradition and is revered as the last independent poet queen of Kashmir

 garuda puraana vaishnav sampradaay se sambandhit he or sanathan dharm main mrityu ke baad sadgati pradaan karne vaala mana jaataa he
 Therefore, there is a provision of listening to Garuda Purana after death in Sanatan Hinduism
 is puranake adhishthatri dev bhagwaan vishnu hai
 In it, with the glory of devotion, knowledge, disinterest, virtue, nishkam karma, many cosmic and otherworldly fruits have been described to instill all the common people in auspicious deeds such as yagna, charity, austerities etc
 iske atirikt isamen ayurveda, nitisar aadi vishayonke varnanake saath mrit jeev ke antim samay main kiye jane vaale krityon kaa vistaar se nirupan kiya gaya he
 Discourse of enlightenment is also its main subject
 atharah puraanon main garudamahapurana kaa apana ek vishesh mahatv he
 Its presiding deity is Lord Vishnu
 atah yah vaishnav puraana he
 The Garuda Purana describes Vishnu-bhakti in detail
 bhagwaan vishnu ke choubees avtaron kaa varnan thik usee prakaar yahaan praapt hota he, jis prakaar 'shrimadbhagwat' main uplabdh hota he
 In the beginning Manu derives the origin of creation, the Dhruva character and the story of the twelve Adityas
 uske uparant surya or chandra grahon ke mantra, shiv-parvati mantra, indra se sambandhit mantra, saraswati ke mantra or nau shaktiyon ke vishay main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 Apart from this, a detailed description of Shraddha-tarpan, measures of liberation and the movement of the creature is found in this Purana
 'garuda puraana' main unniis hajaar shloke kahe jate hai, kintu vartmaan samay main kul saat hajaar shloke hi uplabdh hai
 This Purana should be kept in two parts
 pehle bhaag main vishnu bhakthi or upasna kii vidhiyon kaa ullekh he tathaa mrityu ke uparant praaia: 'garuda puraana' ke shravan kaa praavdhaan he
 In the second part, describing in detail the phantom cycle, there is an account of the falling of the creatures in different hells
 isamen marane ke baad manushya kii kya gati hoti he, uskaa kis prakaar kii yoniyon main janm hota he, pret yoni se mukt kaise pai ja sakati he, shraadh or a detailed description of how one should perform Pitru Karma and how salvation can be attained through the cruel sorrow of hells
 maharishi kashyap ke putr pakshiraj garud ko bhagwaan vishnu kaa vaahan kaha gaya he
 Once Garuda asked Lord Vishnu many deep and mysterious questions related to the condition of the creatures after death, the yamlok-yatra of the creature, the hell obtained by various deeds, the vagaries and the misery of sinners
 us samay bhagwaan vishnu ne garud kii jigyaasa shant karte hue unhen jo gyaanamay upadesh diya tha, usee upadesh kaa is puraana main vistrut vivechan kiya gaya he
 It was through Garuda that after the death of Lord Vishnu from Shrimukh, esoteric and ultimate welfare words were revealed, hence this Purana is called 'garuda Purana'
 shri vishnu dwaara pratipaadit yah puraana mukhyatah vaishnav puraana he
 This Purana has also been called ‘main Garudi Vidya’
 is puraana kaa gyaan sarvapratham brahmaji ne maharishi veda vyas ko pradaan kiya tha

 Kiss originates from Wicked Lester, a New York City-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley

 Frehley impressed the group with his first audition, although he came wearing two different shoes, one red and one orange
 a few weeks after Frehley joined, the name Wicked Lester was dropped and the band became Kiss
 stanley yah naam tab saamne laaye jab vah, simons or kris new yark shahar main yaha-waha gaadi chalaa rahe the
 Chris mentioned that he was in a band called Lips, so Stanley said something to the effect of, "how would it be?" When Frehley went to write his band's name on a poster above Wicked Lester outside the club where he was going to play, he created the current-style logo giving the "SS" the appearance of a lightning bolt
 runi akshar naji eses ke nishaan ke jaise prathit hue, ek aisa chinh jo ab germany main pradarshit karnaa avaidh he
 So to avoid controversy, since 1979 a modified version of the logo has been used in most of the band's album covers and merchandise in Germany, with the "SS" appearing to be a backwards folded "ZZ" it happens

 29 april ko, band ne da mike duglas sho par "firehouse" pradarshit kiya
 The broadcast included Simmons' first interview to be broadcast on Doordarshan, a conversation with Douglas in which Simmons described himself as an "avatar of wickedness", deriding an annoying and mainly ambiguous audience

 In August 1974, the band stopped in Los Angeles to begin recording their second album Hotter Than Hell, which was released on October 22, 1974
 Only one single, "let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll", failed on the charts and the album stayed at number 100

 Kiss wanted to express the excitement he felt at his concerts with his first live album
 Released on September 10, 1975, Alive! Went on to become Gold and became Kiss's first Top 40 single, a live version of "rock and Roll All Night"
 It was the first version of "rock and Roll All Night" with a guitar solo and the recording has begun to feature a permanent version of the song, removing the studio original

 To achieve this, an ambitious, two-pronged strategy was formulated for 1978

 Although Kiss has claimed that the solo albums were intended to correct the growing tension between the bands, their 1976 record contract actually demanded four solo records, with each group having five records The commitment was being counted as one half album

 For the band members, it was a chance to show their personal musical style and style outside of Kiss and in some cases to collaborate with contemporary artists
 Stanley and Frehley's albums were very close to the successful hard rock style used by Kiss, while Chris' album featured an R&B style and was full of ballads

 In order to make matters worse, after receiving negative feedback about the album following a prior philosophy of his record company, Kiss went on record in several countries to emphasize the possible singles "the Oath" and "A World Without Heroes"
 'S track sequences changed, which only ensured the listener's inability to understand the previously disorganized plot
 ek baar jari karne par, da elder ke liye prashansakon kii pratikriya kathor thi; vah gold pad hasil karne main asamarth rahaa or billboard elbum chart par number 75 par rahaa
 The band made only two appearances in support of the new album, both in January 1982
 One exhibition was on abc's late night show Fridays, while the other was a lip-smacking exhibition that aired via satellite during the Sanremo Festival in Italy

 Frehley, who had been disappointed with Kiss's new musical direction, was absent from the second performance
 band ke ek pratyay elbum ricard karne ke fasale se pareshaan, unhone elbum ke nirmaan main sakriy rup se bhaag nahin liya or keval ek trek, "dark lite" main mukhya kanth sangeet diya
 He recorded his guitar parts in his home studio in Wilton, Connecticut and mailed Ezrin by post
 frehale ke liye pareshaani ki ek or vajah yah thi ki peter kris ke prasthaan or car ke baraabar ke bhagidaar na rahane ke kaaran, vah group ke fasalon main aksar 2-1 se rah jate the
 In June 1982, an agreement was reached about Frehley's departure from the band, although he did not officially leave until December and remained a business partner with Simmons and Frehley until 1985
 apni aatmakatha kis and mek-ap main simons ne kaha ki edi vine helen frehale kaa sthaan bharna chaahate the

 Although Frehley had already decided to leave the band, he was featured on the cover of 1982's Killers and Creatures of the Night, though he did not participate in the recording of any of the albums
 kricharaz of da nit kis kii aaj tak kii sabase baari elbum thi or haalanki yah music from "da elder" se behatar maani gai, yah charts par number 45 par rahi or 1994 tak ise gold pramanit nahi kiya gaya

 ) disambar 1982 main jab band ne apni dasvin varshganth kaa daura aarambh kiya tab vincent ne aadhikarik taur par frehale kaa sthaan le liya
 Vincent originally wanted to use his birth name in the band, but Jean Simmons refused it on the basis that it sounded "quite racial": especially according to Simmons "it sounds like a fruit seller
" is"; Simmons went on to say that "appropriately or unfairly, rock and roll is about the image"
 Vincent then suggested the name "mick Fury" but this was also refused
 baad main simons ne suzav diya ki naam badal kar vini vincent rakh den
 Vincent began to actively try to join Kiss as a full member
 un galatchhemiyon ke baavjood jo simons or stanley ko unke vyaktitv ke bare main thi, vincent ko band main le liya gaya

 vincent lik it ap ke cover par dikhaai die or unhen mukhya guitar vadak ke rup main khyaati praapt hui
 Vincent co-authored eight of the ten songs on the album "fits Like a Glove" and "dance All Over Your Face" was written by Simmons alone
 afvaah yah bhi he ki vincent elbum ke geeton kii lead ko sampoornataa ricard karte the or simons vincent kii rachanaatmak kshamtaaon kaa damaghontate hue un lead main se un bhaagon kaa chayan karte the jo unhen geeton ke hisaab se shreshth lagate the
 Apparently, Simmons wanted a more melodious sound and experience that Kiss's fans had always heard and used to use in Frehley's guitar solo
 iske atirikt, vincent ke guitar ekal ke sidhe prasaaran ke dauraan unka pradarshan band kar diya jaataa tha kyunki stanley or simons donon ko lagata tha ki vincent kaa lead bahut lanbaa jaataa he
 Vincent's personality did not fare well with both Stanley and Simmons, and he was fired from Kiss at the end of the Creatures tour
 lik it ap ke liye recording shuru hone se purv unhen phir se kaam par rakhaa gaya kyunki simons or stanley ko itani jaldi koi nayaa lead guitaravadak nahin mil paaya
 Personality issues once again arose, and Vincent was fired after the Lick It Up tour and was replaced by Mark St
 John
 1997 main elbum ke punah vasheebhoot hone tak kricharaz of da nit main vincent ke kaam ko aadhikarik taur par manyata praapt nahin hui
 Kiss later used Vincent as a songwriter on his 1992 album Revenge, in which he contributed songs such as "anholi", "heart of Chrome" and "I Just Wanna"
 yah haalanki usase kaaphi pehle kii baat he, jab vincent, simons or stanley teesri baar ek duusare ke saath jhagade or unke sangeet sambandh sthaayee rup se tut gaye
 Over the years, constant rumors have been circulated among Kiss fans about the real reason for Vincent's removal, in which at least one band member declined to comment, saying only legally that it was not the subject of discussion Was
 simons ne kai saal baad ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki vincent ke nikaale jane kii vajah unka "aniatik vyavhaar" tha magar unhone koi bhi vistrut jaankaree dete hue ise vistaar main nahin bataaya
 "I named Vincent Cusano" Winnie Vincent "
 This is the only gift he is allowed

 With the success of the album and its subsequent tour, Kiss had somewhat regained its former glory

 The game in simple language is as follows: overon kii sankhya main kami ke sthiti main, udhaaharan ke liye kharaab mausam ke kaaran, overon kii sankhya kam ho sakati he
 If for some reason the number of overs played by the team batting in the second innings is different from the team batting in the first innings, the result can be determined by the Duckworth – Lewis method

 yah niyam 1 oktober 2007 ko dambula stadium main srilanka va england ke bich khele gaye match main lagu kiya gaya tha
