 Flu powder can be used from any furnace connected to the flu system
 To go from one place to another, the fire of the first place is lit from where the departure takes place
 In this, passengers throw a handful of flu powder into the fire, so that it turns green like emeralds and after that they descend into the furnace and say their destination place in a clear and objective voice
 Flu powder is also used in contact instruments; a magician or sorceress bowing in front of Agni and takes his head to Agni, who appears to be placed in another place within Agni, by doing so, he can contact anyone
 It is also known that body parts can also be sent from one place to another through flu powder, flu powder ke madhyam se logon ko bulaayaa bhi ja saktaa he, jaisaa ki prisionar of ajbakaan main snep dwaara dikhaaya gaya he, jo maraders map ke sambandh main harry se poochtacha ke dauraan apane karyaalay kii bhatti dwaara lupin ko vahaan bulaata he
 In the Chamber of Secrets, the Weasley family flies to diaagan through flu powder
 Harry does not explicitly name "diagon Alley" and instead says "diagonally", so he arrives at Bourgin & Barx, located at Knockturn Alley
 In the fourth book, Mr
 Weasley uses his position in the ministry to temporarily connect the furnace of the Dursley couple's residence to the flu system, unaware that it is blocked
 In this book, Sirius also uses the same mechanism to contact Harry
 In the fifth book, Harry uses Gryffindor's furnace and then uses Umbridge's furnace to contact Sirius; She has to use Umbridge's furnace because she was monitoring all the connectivity of Hogwarts
 The flu system is controlled by the Ministry of Magic

 The Knight Bus is a highly enchanted, purple-colored, three-tier regent bus that transports magicians and sorcerers
 It is first mentioned in The Prisoner of Azkaban where Harry inadvertently moves his wand hand, so that it simply stops
 Harry eventually travels in a night bus with several of his companions in the Order of Phoenix
 The speed of the knight bus is greater than the speed of the broomstick, but it is not as rapid or instantaneous as that of the flu powder or magical medium
 The bus charges for its service; Harry has to pay a base fare of 11 cycles to travel from Little Whining to The Leaky Cauldron
 Facilities like hot-water bottles, brush brushes and hot chocolates are available on this bus free of cost with a little extra cost

 RT4497 was also used
 portkies kaa pratham ullekh gobalet of fire main mistar vizali ke dwaara kiya gaya tha
 They provide an alternative impression, but they can be used more significantly to transport a group of people at a time
 They were created using the magic of Portas, Portkey can deliver his touches anywhere he wishes, or activate it at a pre-determined time and transport it anywhere with the person touching it at that time

 The construction of portkeys is prohibited and is controlled by the portkey office of the Department of Magical Transport: Cornelius Fudge opposes the creation of a portkey by Dumbledore in front of him, saying that Dumbledore does not have its authority; And once upon a time, Lupine says, "

 Sirius has a flying motor bike that he gave to Hagrid the day Harry's parents died
 It was first seen when Hagrid gave the boy Harry the number four, Private Drive in the first book, after which Hagrid used it to help Harry in the seventh book when he wanted to go to the Order's office

 The bike was severely damaged when Hagrid and Harry crashed it into the garden pond of Ted and Andromeda Tonk
 Mr
 Weasley secretly tells Harry that they will fix the bike again "on time," meaning that Mrs
 Weasley would be busy somewhere or forgot about it
 He hid it in the chickens' enclosure and somehow fixed it, and gave Harry back again between the Deathly Hallows and the Epilogue

 The ministry described in the Order of Phoenix had a large amount of time turners; However, in an incident described in that book, an almirah with glass façade, in which the time-turner was kept, is destroyed
 Due to the qualities that can affect their time, the Almari is seen falling, breaking and recovering on its own
 In half-blood Prince, Hermione recounts an article published in The Daily Profit that states that "the entire stock of time-turners in the ministry was destroyed" with the accident
 The book does not describe the ministry
 Who else can have a time-turner? harmion kaa time-turnar ek necoles main lage ret-ghadi ke sadrush jhumake jaisaa dikhta he; yah spasht nahin he ki kya sabhi dikhne main vaise hi hai

 Although this set is only mentioned in the series of books, the film version of the half-blood Prince reveals that these cabinets were very prevalent when Voldemort first came into power, because of this crisis
 In the event that Voldemort and his Death Eaters easily escaped

 Quick Quotes Quill is a stenographic device that is green like acid, it is used by Rita Skitter to convey the words of her subject in a more dramatic and vulgar way, which she likes more
 Rita uses this quill during her daily column in The Goblet of Fire during an interview with Harry about participating in the Triwizard contest
 Harry constantly corrects this quill's impurity for Rita
 However, she continues to ignore it sternly
 In addition, in Deathly Hallows, Rita says in her interview about Dumbledore's posthumous biography that Quick Quotes Quill helped her write this book so fast after her death

 Omniqulars are magical telescopes made of brass that Harry, Ron and Hermione use during the Quidditch World Cup in the fourth book
 In addition to magnified lenses, omniculars also have many other features
 These characteristics include reducing or re-viewing the architectural speed seen by the lens, although a side effect of this is that the view from the lens does not completely match the current view on the other side
 , Because it is slowed down to the pace of real life
 It also has a moment-by-play feature, where moves by Quidditch players are shown on omnicular lenses in bright purple words

 a wand is a device made of wood that is used to focus magical energy and increase its power, and without which only limited magic can be performed
 In the magical world, the wand is used as both a weapon and a tool
 They have also been used in the preparation of many potions in the book
 The wand is usually placed inside the magician's costume or else it can be placed anywhere near him according to the book; However, they can also be placed in other items
 For example, Rubias Hagrid puts half of his broken wand under his umbrella and in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Lucius Malfoy appears to have his wand in his stick
 
 In the magical world, when a magician commits a serious crime, his wand is broken into two pieces

 Wands are generally considered to be the personal belongings of a magician
 However, any other magician's key wand can be used to comparatively lesser effect
 In the Philosopher's Stone, Harry has to test several of the wands before he can get a "selected" wand for himself
 Wands of a common core show surprising effects when forced to fight each other, as happened between Harry and Voldemort
 gaublate of fire main, yah pataa chalata he ki un donon kii vaind main fox pakshi kii poonch kaa pankh laga he, foch, dambaldor ke finnics kaa naam tha
 After the primary initiation, Wand learns about his opponent's master, as described in the Deathly Hallows
 Whereas, according to Olivender, if the magician is strong, any object can concentrate magical energy through him, usually for this reason the wand is prevalent because they are efficient
 Through this, it becomes clear that how many magicians are able to use mantras even without a wand

 The main question is that who had the right to own land - the state, the peasant or any middle class, according to the opinion of the scholars, this right was the right in ancient India, which cannot be called the right of self

 But even in this crisis, the rights of the farmers were not fully surrendered
 bharat main angrejon ke aagamankaal se hi jameendaari pratha kaa udai hone laga
 The British rulers believed that they were the owners of the land and the farmers were their subjects, so they made permanent and temporary arrangements with big farmers and kings and landlords
 yadhyapi raajnneetik auchity se prabhavit hokar usne ek ek pargana har kar vasuul karanevaale ijaaredaar ko paanch varsh ke liye patte par de diya
 Thus, the Zamindari system was recognized by the British, although initially it was not their idea to deprive the peasants of their rights, Lord Corn Wallis became the Governor General in 1786, after Warren Hastigze
 lard cornwalis bhi jameendaari pratha ke paksh main tha

 The zamindari system emerged in Madras through the auction policy of the British rulers
 gaanvon kii bhoomi kaa vibhaajan kar unhen nilaam kar diya jaataa tha or adhiktam mulya denevaale ko vikray kar diya jaataa tha
 Initially, the settlement in Awadh was done by the cultivator but later it was settled with the landlords due to political reasons

 This is the simplest way to collect unjust amount of money and it is also useful from the point of view of politics because as a result, a powerful and rich section of the government will continue to get help
 is prakaar bharatvarsh ke itihaas main sarvapratham in bandobaston dwaara rajya or krishakon ke bich main jameendaaron kaa varg angrejon kii niti dwaara sthapit hua jiske fal swaroop krishakon ke bhu-sampatti adhikaar, jo anadi kaal se chale aa rahe the, chhin gaye
 This intermediate class became wealthier day by day as the British rulers continued to give more and more of their money as a bait
 in bandobaston main krishakon ke hiton kii ore koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha jiske parinamswaroop unka du:kha, apmaan evam daridray din pratidin badhata gaya
 Many times the British rulers also pointed out that the land tenure of the farmers should be protected and their rent should be fixed till the time of settlement
 phir bhi kuch nahin kiya gaya
 The reason for this was that the British rulers believed that when they would be prosperous and satisfied in showing leniency in dealing with the zamindars, they would not persecute their assassins, as a result of which they would also be happy
 parantu yah unki mahaan bhul thi kyonki jameendaaron ne hameshaa hi apane kartavya ke saath vishwasghaat kiya
 Therefore, the British rulers felt that this mistake should be rectified
 falswaroop unhone krishakon kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye bhoomi sambandhi vidhaanon kii vyavastha kii
 This step can be called the first step towards the end of Zamindari system
 is pratham charan main, jo san 1859 i0 se 1929 i0 tak rahaa, jo kanoon bane unase jameendaaron ke lagaan badhaane ke adhikaron par kuch pratibandh lagaae gaye or ucch shrenee ke krishakon ko laabh bhi hue
 But the main purpose of these laws was to facilitate the zamindars in collecting the revenue so that they can give revenue to the state at the right time
 san 1859 i0 main bhoomi sambandhi pehla adhinium paas hua
 This Act was an ideal land-act for all British India, according to which the Act passed in all parts of India and amendments were made from time to time to pacify the disgruntled farmers
 kintu jameendaar phir bhi krishakon ko apane nyaaypurna tathaa anyaaypurna karon ko vasuulne ke liye nichodte rahe jisase kisaanon main ghor asantosh tathaa bechaini failene lagi
 The second phase of the Zamindari system took place from 1930 AD to 1944 AD
 is samay main saare desh main kisaan andolan hone lage
 The seed of these movements was sown by a Kisan Sabha which took place on 11 February 1918 in Allahabad meeting of All India Congress
 tatpashchaat congress kisaanon ke hiton ko aage badhaane lagi
 As a result, there was a lot of awareness among the rural masses

 Influenced by the peasant movements, new Acts were enacted in the Raiyatwadi areas to protect the interests of the farmers

 After this, Bhopal Land Revenue Act, 1935 and Assam Tenancy Act 1935 passed

 Therefore, the Indian National Congress has several times announced that the abolition of Zamindari should give a prominent place in the Congress program
 ek kisaan conference taarikh 27,28 april san 1935 i0 ko sardaar patel ke sabhapatitv main elahabaad main hui thi
 He took a major step towards this by passing the proposal for the abolition of Zamindari, in this proposal it was declared that 'the present Zamindari system is completely opposite from the view of Gramakalyan
 yah pratha british shashan ke aagaman main laai gai or isse gramin jivan purnataya tahas nahas ho gaya he’
 But as World War II started in 1939, the entire program of land reform was halted
 yuddh kii samaapti ke baad jameendaari pratha ke ant kaa antim charan aarambh hua jo san 1945 se 1955 tak chalaa
 At the end of the war, the British government decided to elect provincial houses in 1945 under the Government of India Act 1935
 congress ne chunaav main bhaag lene kaa nishchay kiya or disambar 1945 main chunaav ghoshnaptr nikaala
 In this manifesto, regarding the abolition of Zamindari, it was clearly stated that 'the improvement of the land system, which is most needed in India, is related to the removal of the middle class between the farmers and the state
 isliye is madhyavarti varg ke adhikaron kaa uchit pratikar dekar praapt kar liya janaa chahie’
 Economists, politicians and journalists all agreed with this manifesto
 jameendaari pratha bhartiya aarthik vikaas main rukawat daalati thi kyonki bade jameendaar hameshaa pratikriyavaad ke samarthak the
 The 'london Economist' wrote about them that 'most of these' Thackerseys' characters were as lame as' Lord Stein ', lazy like' Jane Austen '' Mr
 Bennet ',' Surtijsquire 'drunk
 bengal land kamishan bhi is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki ‘san 1793 i0 kaa sthaayee bandobast us samay jin bhi kaarnon se uchit samajha gaya ho, aaj kii paristhiti main anupyukt he or jameendaari pratha main itani buraaiyaan upaj chuki he ki yah ab raashtra ke hit main kisi bhi prakaar upyogi nahin rah gai he
 'in the opinion of Indian and Western economists, the abolition of zamindari is necessary for more agricultural production
 iske atirikt yah pratha sansar ke har bhaag main samyaanukool na hone ke kaaran samaapt ho chuki he
 PS, this practice is more expensive for the state
 sarvopari, yah pratha is samay aisi sthiti par pahunch chuki thi ki yadi iskaa unmoolan na kiya gaya hota to iske kaaran ne keval rashtriya aarthik samasya par hi varan samaaj suraksha par bhi vipatti aa padati
 Therefore, as a result of the success of elections in 1946, when the Congress cabinet was formed in every province, a bill was introduced to abolish the Zamindari system according to the election pledge
 ye vidheyak san 1950 i0 se 1955 i0 tak adhinium banakar chaalu ho gaye jinke parinamswaroop jameendaari pratha kaa bharat main unmoolan ho gaya or krishakon evam rajya ke bich pun: sidhaa sambandh sthapit ho gaya
 The landowners now got back to the farmers which they had been using since time immemorial
 is prakaar jis jameendaari pratha kaa udai hamaare desh main angrejon ke aagaman se hua tha uskaa ant bhi unke shashan ke samaapt hote hi ho gaya
 At the end of this practice, no one mourned at all, because the old theory, according to which the owner of the land used to be an agriculturist, recurred as soon as it was destroyed

 Seth Sati Das Ji was full of the blood of Hindutva in the Kirag-rag, he strongly rejected the proposal of Subedar

 This method is considered the national Roman transliteration method of India and is recognized by the Government of India

 For example, "t" and "t" are both changed to "t"
 thik isi tarah, 'da' or 'da' donon ko "d" likhaa jaataa he
 To overcome this lack of original Hantarian, some modified Hanterian systems were created, using nukes and other symbols to establish a unique form in the Roman script for every character in Devanagari, for example "t" and "t" for "t"
 "for" ṭ "
 hindi dwaara prayog hone vaale devanagari ke mukhya swar hantarian lipyantaran ke baad is prakaar likhe jate hai - In the modified Hunterian transliteration, the nukes are often placed below the transliterated Roman letters to denote holly letters

 For example, 'now' is read 'əb' in the international phonetic alphabet, not 'əbə'
 hantarian main agar kahin bhi nihit 'a' ki dhwani ho to use spasht rup se 'a' likhaa jaataa he
 If modified, it is represented using punctuation in some modified Hunterian methods

 Linguistics scholars are called 'philologists'
 bhashavigyaan, vyakaran se bhinn he
 Functional study of a language is done in grammar while the linguist goes on to do a very comprehensive study of the language
 adhyayan ke anek vishyon main se aajkal bhashaa-vigyaan ko vishesh mahatva diya ja rahaa he
 This language-related study has been named in Europe with many names and nouns till date
 sarvapratham is adhyayan ko philology shabd ke aage visheshan ke rup main ek shabd joda gaya- tab ise ‘‘comparative philology’’ kah kar pukaara gaya
 Until the nineteenth century, grammar and linguistic studies were often considered to be the same
 atah ise vidwaanon ne 'comparative grammer' naam bhi diya
 In France it was named Langistić
 france main bhashaa sambandhi kaary adhik hone ke kaaran unnisvin sadi main sampoorn europe main hi "linguistique" athwa "linguistics" naam hi prachlit rahaa he
 Apart from this, other names like 'science of Language', 'glutology' etc
 also came in handy to reveal this subject
 aaj in sabhi naamon main se ‘‘linguisticks’’, ‘‘philology’’ maatr hi prayog main laae jate hai
 In addition to all these European names in India, the names which are used in Hindi language are as follows - "bhasha-shastra", "bhasha-tattva", "bhasha-sasti", and "" Comparative linguistics "etc
 in sabhi naamon main se sarv prachlit naam ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ he
 All the names, ancient and new, appear to be synonymous in these names
 atah yahi naam is shaastra ke liye sarvatha upyukt prathit hota he

 aadhunik vishay ke rup main bhashaa-vigyaan kaa sutarapaat europe main san 1786 i0 main sar wiliam jones naamak vidwaan dwaara kiya gaya mana jaataa he
 In the context of the study of Sanskrit language, Sir William Jones had first done a comparative study of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin language and expressed the possibility that at least one of the languages forms the basis of these three languages

 The word 'bhasha' is derived from the Sanskrit "bhash" metal
 jiskaa arth he-vyakt vaak 
 The word 'science' is formed by applying the prefix 'v' and 'lute' from the 'known' metal
 saamaanya rup se ‘bhashaa’ kaa arth he ‘bol chaal kii bhashaa yaa boli’ tathaa ‘vigyaan’ kaa arth he ‘vishesh gyaan’, kintu ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ shabd main prayukt in donon padon kaa spasht or vyapak arth samaj lene par hi ham is naam kii sargarbhitako jaanane main safal honge

 Language serves as an important tool for publishing the entire knowledge of human beings, to know the history of civilization and culture
 hamaare purvapurushon se sabhi saadhaaran or asaadhaaran anubhav ham bhashaa ke madhyam se hi jaan sake hai
 Knowledge from all our scriptures and scriptures is dependent on language
 mahakavi dandi ne apane mahaan granth ‘kavyadarsh’ main bhashaa kii mahatta suchit karte hue likhaa haih- That is, this entire Bhuvan would have become dark, if the word-form light in the world was not the light of language
 spasht hi he ki yah kathan maanav bhashaa ko lakshya karke hi kaha gaya he
 The sounds that animals and birds take shelter to express their expressions may be language for them, but due to being ambiguous to humans, scholars have called it 'latent speech', which is language- Nothing matters from the point of view of science
 kyonki ‘avyakt vaak’ main shabd or arth donon hi aspasht bane rahete hai
 Humans also sometimes use signs of limbs, fidgeting, hand-to-feet, face etc
 to express their feelings, but in spite of being a language, it is not 'express speech'
 maanav bhashaa kii sabase badi visheshta yah hoti he ki vah ‘vyakt vaak’ arthath shabd or arth kii spashtataa liye hue hoti he
 According to Patanjali, the author of Mahabhashya, 'express speech' refers to the descriptive language
 yah satya he ki kabhi-kabhi sanketon or angabhangimaaon kii sahaayta se bhi hamaare bhav or vichaaron kaa preshan badi saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this way, those gestures become symbols of language, but the most appropriate means of expressing human emotion is the descriptive language which has been given the noun of 'express speech'
 is main vibhinn arthon ko prakat karne ke liye kuch nischit uccharit yaa kathith dhvaniyon kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 Therefore, language is called a group of words which are filled with signs of different meanings
 jinke dwaara ham apane manobhaav saralata se dusron ke prati prakat kar sakate hai
 Thus, while defining the language, we can call it a medium adopted to exchange thoughts and expressions in human society, which holds the meaningful basis for the sounds that have been effortlessly ejected from the utterances of humans
 wo dhwani-samooh shabd kaa rup tab lete hai jab ve kisi arth se jud jate hai
 Entire phonology is based on a 'random' relationship with its meaning
 ‘yadrichhik’ kaa arth he purnataya kalpit
 In short, we call that word group pronounced with different meanings expressed in different meanings through which we convey our feelings and thoughts to others
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan se hamen anek laabh hote hai, jaise- 1

 bhashaa, lipi aadi main saralata, shuddhta aadi kii drushti se parivartan-parivardhan main sahaayta
 In view of all these benefits, linguistics is considered to be a very useful subject in today's era, and its field of study is constantly developing
 bhashaa ek prakritik vastu he jo maanav ko ishwariya vardaan ke rup main mili hui he
 Language is formed by naturally sounding sounds from the mouth of man
 bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan iske bolne or sunne vaale sabhi ko ho jaataa he
 This is called general knowledge of language
 iske aage, bhashaa kab bani, kaise bani ? iskaa praarambhik evam pracheen swaroop kya tha ? isamen kab-kab, kya-kya parivartan hue or un parivartanon ke kya kaaran hai ? athwa kul milakar bhashaa kaise viksit hui ? us vikaas ke kya kaaran hai ? koun si bhashaa kis duusari bhashaa se kitni samanta yaa vishmata rakhti he ? yah sab bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan yaa ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ kaha jayega
 This particular form of linguistics, ie linguistics, has been considered as an important subject of study today
 bhashaa-vigyaan jab adhyayan ke vishyon main badi-badi kakshaon ke paathyakramon ke antargat sammilit kiya gaya to sarvapratham yah ek swaabhaavik prashn utpann hua ki bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala ke antargat gina jaae yaa vigyaan main
 That is, linguistics is art or science
 adhyayan kii prakriya evam nishkarshon ko lekar nishchay kiya jane laga ki vastutah use bhautik vigyaan, evam rasayan vigyaan aadi kii bhanti vishuddh vigyaan mana jaae athwa chitra, sangeet, murti, kavy aadi kalaon kii bhanti kala ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaae
 Art is related to human beings objects or subjects
 yahi kaaran he ki kala vyakti pradhan yaa purnatah vaiyaktik hoti he
 Apart from being relative, a particular country and period also have an influence on art
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki kisi kaal main kala ke prati jo mulya rahete hai unamem kaalaantar main naye-naye parivartan upasthit ho jate hai tathaa ve kisi duusare desh main bhi maan liye jaaen, yah bhi aavashyak nahin he
 a person is feeling high artistic expression in an object
 kintu duusare ko vah is prakaar kii na lag rahi ho
 Therefore, the perception of art varies from person to person
 kala kaa sambandh maanav hriday kii ragatmik vritti se hota he
 There is a mixture of aesthetics of the person in it
 kala kaa uddeshy bhi soundaryanubhuti karana, yaa anand pradaan karnaa he, kisi vastu kaa tathvik vishleshan karnaa nahin
 The test of all these characteristics of the nature of art shows that linguistics is not art
 kyonki uskaa sambandh hriday kii sarasata-vritti se na hokar buddhi kii tatvagrahi drushti se hota he
 The aim of linguistics is not to provide beauty or entertainment
 vah to hamaare bauddhik chintan ko prakhar banaata he
 Elemental assessment of the existence of language
 uskaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 The findings of linguistics do not change on the basis of any person, nation or period and the basic basis of the study of linguistics, which is language, is not a humanized substance
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham kala ke kshetra main nahin gin sakate
 The usefulness of linguistics is that it teaches the art of language teaching
 isi kaaran sweet ne vyakaran ko bhashaa ko kala tathaa vigyaan donon kaha he
 Pure pronunciation, effective use of language can be placed in the category of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala kii seemaa main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, yah nishchay ho jane par yah prashn uthta he ki kya bhashaa-vigyaan, bhautik-shaastra, rasayan-vigyaan aadi vishyon kii bhanti purnatah vigyaan he ? In the belief of many scholars, linguistics is not a pure science
 unki dharna ke anusaar abhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi prayog purnataa ko praapt nahin hue hai or uske nishkarshon ko isiilie antim nishkarsh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 At the same time, not all conclusions of linguistics are as universal and eternal as science
 jis prakaar ganit shaastra main 2 + 2 = 4 saarvkalik, vikalparahit nishkarsh he jo sarvatra sweekaar kiya jaataa he, bhashaa-vigyaan ke paas is prakaar ke vikalp-rahit nirvivaad nishkarsh nahin he
 In science, facts are compiled and analyzed, and the laws of sound are mostly non-committal, so according to some scholars, linguistics can be placed between humanities and science
 vichaar karne par ham dekhte hai ki vigyaan kii aaj kii durat pragati main prayek vishesh gyaan apane aagaamee gyaan ke saamne purana or avaigyanik siddh hota ja rahaa he
 In today's era of continual innovators, the scientific view is constantly going from micro to micro and new to new
 aaj ke viksit gyaan-kshetra ko dekhte hue kai vaigyanik manyataayen puraani or feeki pad gai he
 Newton's theory of light is also now being viewed with suspicion
 isse yah siddh hota ho jaataa he ki nutan gyaan ke prakaash main puraatan gyaan bhi vigyaan ke kshetra se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Therefore, considering it from the point of view of pure knowledge, we find linguistics within the range of science itself
 bhashaa-vigyaan nishchay hi ek vigyaan he jiske antargat ham bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan praapt karte hai
 It is true that linguistics has not yet been fully developed on a scientific level
 yahi kaaran he ki prasiddh grim-niyam ke aage chal kar grassmaan or varnor ko usamen sudhaar karnaa padaa he
 Prior to the above reforms, the sound rule of Grimm was considered to be the definite rule and even after the reforms it is considered to be the definite rule
 is prakaar naye gyaan ke prakaash main puraane siddhanton kaa khandan hone se vigyaan kaa koi virodh nahin he
 Actually this is pure science
 san 1930 ke baad jahaan varnanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan ko punah mahatva praapt hua, vahaan tab se lekar aaj tak drut gati main vikaas hua he
 Ever since new tests have started with the help of instruments in the field of sound and the conclusions obtained have started to be completely regular, since then linguistics has gradually started to be considered in the category of science
 vigyaan kii ek badi visheshta he uskaa prayogtmak hona
 After American scholar Baloom Field, American linguists have developed experimental linguistics with great intensity as a new method of linguistics with phonology and morphology etc
 is paddati ke antargat bhashaa-vigyaan prayogshaalaon kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he or uske liye anek yantron kaa avishkaar ho gaya he
 Seeing this, this subject will definitely be called science, there is no doubt in it at all
 aajkal jabaki samaaj-vigyaan, manovigyaan aadi shastreey vishyon ke liye jahaan vigyaan shabd kaa prayog karne kii parampara chal padi he tab shuddh kaaran-kaary parampara par aadhaarit bhashaa-vigyaan ko vigyaan kahana kisi bhi drushti se anuchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has written in his book Language Secret- mangal dev shastri ke shabdon main- This definition is given in Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari's 'linguistics' text as follows- upar di gai sabhi paribhaashaon par vichaar karne se gyaat hota he ki unamem paraspar koi antar nahin he
 In the definition of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das, where the focus has been on linguistics only, Mangaldev Shastri and Bholanath Tiwari have included the types of study of linguistics in their definitions
 paribhaasha vah acchhee hoti he jo sankshipt ho or spasht ho
 Thus, we can give a new definition of linguistics in this way - "the study by which the study of human languages is subtle and analytical is called linguistics
" ” In other words, linguistics is that in which subtle and extensive scientific study of human languages is done
 bhashaa ke prachlit vartmaan swaroop ko chhod kar shesh sari adhyayan saamagree bhashaa-vigyaan ko sahitya se hi uplabdh hoti he
 If Sanskrit, Greek and Avesta literature were not in front of us today, linguistics would never have been successful in knowing that these three languages originated from any one native language
 isi prakaar adikaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak kaa hindi sahitya hamaare saamne na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan hindi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan kis prakaar kar paata
 Linguistics to study language in any way, he has to take help of literature on foot
 bundelkhand ke natkhat baalkon ke munh se yah sun kar- The grammar says what a problem this is, only the study of ancient literature will tell him that this is the impaired form of the first sutra of Shaktayan, 'un Namah Siddham'
 sahitya bhi bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se apni anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane main safal ho jaataa he
 Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has clarified their meanings by linking many words of 'padmavat' with their original forms, validated on the basis of linguistic principles
 saath hi shuddh paath ke nirdhaaran main bhi isse paryaapt sahaayta lee he
 Hence, both literature and linguistics are supportive of each other
 bhashaa hamaare bhaavon-vichaaron arthath man kaa pratibimb hoti he atah bhashaa kii sahaayta se bahut se samasyaon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Economics in particular is completely based on psychology
 vaakya-vigyaan ke adhyayan main bhi manovigyaan se paryaapt sahaayta milti he
 Sometimes psychology also helps us to know the cause of sound changes
 bhashaa kii utpatti tathaa praarambhik rup kii jaankaree main bhi bal-manovigyaan tathaa aviksit logon kaa manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Psychology also has to seek help from linguistics in its medical practice to know the meaning of the patient
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se ek manovigyaani rogi kii manogranthiyon kaa pataa lagane main safal ho saktaa he
 Due to the close relationship between linguistics and psychology, a new study method is being developed nowadays called Language Psychology or Psycholinguistics
 bhashaa mukh se nikalne vaali dhwani ko kehete hai atah bhashaa-vigyaan main hawa bheetar se kaise chalati he, swaryantr, swartantri, nasikavivar, kauwa, taalu, daant, jeebh, onth, kanth, moorddha tathaa naak ke kaaran usamen kya parivartan hote hai tathaa kaan dwaara kaise dhwani grahan kii jaati he, in sabakaa adhyayan karnaa padataa he
 Physiology only helps him in this
 likhit bhashaa kaa grahan aankh dwaara hota he or is prakriya kaa adhyayan bhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat hi hota he
 For this also he has to be indebted to physiology
 bhashaa-vigyaan or bhugol kaa bhi-gaharaa sambandh he
 According to some people, the geographical conditions of a place have a profound influence on its language
 kisi sthaan main boli jane vaali bhashaa main vahaan ke ped-paudhe, pakshi, jeev-jantu evam ann aadi ke liye shabd avashya milte hai parantu yadi unamem se kisi kii samaapti ho jaae to uskaa naam vahaan kii bhashaa se bhi juda ho jaataa hai
 The word 'somlata' is not used in our language today
 is lop kaa kaaran sambhavtah bhugolic hi he
 Geographic conditions are also the result of lack of a language spread in a place, less development in language and many dialects in a place
 durgam parvaton par rahane vaali jatiyon kaa paraspar kam sampark hone ke kaaran unki boli prasar nahin kar paati
 The dialect of people living across rivers differs from the common language
 deshon, nagaron, nadiyon tathaa praanton aadi ke naamon kaa bhashaa-vaigyanik adhyayan karne main bhugol badi manoranjak saamagree pradaan karata he
 Even in the field of economics, geography helps linguistics
 ‘ushtr’ kaa arth bhainsa se oont kaise ho gaya tathaa ‘saindhav’ kaa arth ghoda or namak hi kyon hua, aadi samasyaon par vichaar karne main bhi bhugol sahaayta karata he
 language-geography, a branch of linguistics, is just like geography
 isi prakaar kisi sthaan ke pragautihaasik kaal ke bhugol kaa adhyayan karne main bhashaa-vigyaan bhi paryaapt sahaayak hota he
 History is also closely related to linguistics
 itihaas ke teen roopon raajnneetik itihaas, dharmik itihaas, saamaajik itihaas-ko lekar yahan bhashaa-vigyaan se uskaa sambandh dikhalaayaa ja rahaa he- Other areas of knowledge like logic, physics and anthropology also provide great help in the study of linguistics
 manushya main anek prakaar ke andhvishwaas ghar kar lete hai jinka uski bhashaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In Indian society, women take their husbands' names in a twisted way, not outright
 raatri main vishaal keedon kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he
 They name their boy Mange, Chedi, Bechu, Ghurahu, Katwaru Alichar or Lendha, etc
 andhvishwaason ke atirikt anya bahut si saamaajik-manovigyaan se sambaddh gutthiyon ke spashtikaran ke liye maanav-vigyaan kii shakha-prashakhaon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 In this way, many fields of knowledge- culture-studies, pedagogy, statistics, text-science, etc
 have a deep connection with linguistics
 maanav kii bhashaa kaa jo kshetra he vahi bhashaa-vigyaan kaa kshetra he
 The languages and dialects of civilized and uncivilized humans around the world are studied under linguistics
 is prakaar bhashaa-vigyaan keval sabhy-saahitiyik bhashaaon kaa hi adhyayan nahin karata apitu asabhy-barbar-asaahitiyik boliyon kaa, jo prachlan main nahin he, ateet ke garv main khoi hui hai un bhashaaon kaa bhi adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 Linguistics is divided into language structure and 'study of meaning' from the point of view of subject division
 isamen bhashaa kaa vaigyanik drushtikon se vishleshan or varnan karne ke saath hi vibhinn bhashaaon ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics has two sides - elemental and applied
 iske atirikt bhashavigyaan kaa gyaan-vigyaan kii anyaanya shakhaon ke saath gaharaa sambandh he
 This has led to the development of various branches of sociolinguistics, psychodynamics, academic linguistics, etc
 bhashavigyaan ke gaun kshetra nimnlikhit hai- Syntax: In language, all thought-exchange is done on the basis of sentences
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke jis vibhaag main is par vichaar kiya jaataa he use vaakya-vichaar yaa vaakya-vigyaan kehete hai
 It has three forms - vaakya-rachana kaa sambandh bolanewaale samaaj ke manovigyaan se hota he
 Therefore this branch of linguistics is very difficult
 rup-vigyaan : vaakya kii rachana padon yaa roopon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 Therefore, the idea of verse or form becomes important after a sentence
 rup-vigyaan ke antargat dhaatu, upsarg, pratyay aadi un sabhi upkarnon par vichaar karnaa padataa he jinase rup banate hai
 Phonology: The base word of form or verse
 shabdon par rachana yaa itihaas in do drushtiyon se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The idea of a person or language is also done under it
 kosh-nirmaan tathaa vyutpatti-shaastra shabd-vigyaan ke hi vichaar-kshetra kii seemaa main aate hai
 The cultural history of the speaker can be known on the basis of the word group of the language
 dhwani-vigyaan : shabd kaa aadhaar he dhwani
 Sounds are studied in many ways under phonology
 iske antargat dhwani-shaastra ek alag se upavibhag he jisamen dhwani utpann karne vaale angon-mukh-vivar, nasika-vivar, swar tantri, dhwani yantra ke saath-saath sunne kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 There are two forms of this study - historical and second comparative
 grim niyam kaa sambandh isi se he
 Economics: The outer part of the sentence ends on the sound
 It is the outer body of the language, next to it the field of his soul begins which we call the meaning
 arth-rahit shabd atmarahit sharir kii bhanti vyarth hota he
 Therefore, meaning is an important part of language
 arth-vigyaan main shabdon ke arthon kaa vikaas tathaa uske kaarnon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 We call any study a scientist when we follow a certain process in it
 bhashaa vigyaan bhi kisi bhashaa ke kaaran-kaaryparak yuktipurna vivechan-vishleshan ke liye kuch nishchit prakriyaaon main bandha kar chalata he
 On the basis of these processes, so far we have received five types of studies of linguistics- saamanyatya bhashaa kaa adhyayan nimnaankit drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he : By descriptive method, the form of one language of the same period is analyzed
 iske liye isamen un siddhanton par prakaash daalaa jaataa, jinke aadhaar par bhashaa-vishesh kii rachanaagat visheshtaon ko spasht kiya ja sake
 It is important to note that in this method language cannot be included in different periods simultaneously, because the analysis of language of every age will have the purpose of separate principles
 panini na keval bharat ke, apitu sansar ke sabase bade bhashavigyaani hai, jinhone varnanaatmak rup main bhashaa kaa vishad evam vyapak adhyayan kiya
 Katyayan and Patanjali also fall in this category
 greek vidwaanon main thraiks, discolas tathaa erodian ne bhi is kshetra main ullekhya kaary kiya tha
 Fully influenced by Panini, Bloomfield paved the way for the development of descriptive linguistics by publishing his book 'language' in 1932 AD
 idhar pashchimi deshon - visheshkar america main varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa aashaatheet vikaas hua he
 The purpose of historical linguistics is to consider changes in different periods in a language and to formulate theories in relation to those changes
 varnanaatmak paddati kaa mul antar yah he ki varnanaatmak paddati jahaan ekakalik he, vahaan aitihaasik paddati dvikalik
 The antiquity of the Sanskrit language attracted the attention of linguists towards the historical method
 'filology' kaa mukhya pratipaadya pracheen granthon kii bhashaaon kaa tulanatamak adhyayan hi tha
 The focus of the scholars was mainly on languages like Sanskrit, German, Greek, Latin
 fredrick ougust woolf ne san 1777 i
 main hi aitihaasik paddati kii ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya tha
 In fact, to understand the developmental form of any language one has to resort to historical method
 puraani hindi athwa madhyakaalin hindi or aadhunik hindi main kya parivartan hua he, ise aitihaasik paddati dwaara hi spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Two or more languages are compared by comparative method
 ise mishrit paddati bhi kah sakate hai, kyonki vivarnaatmak paddati tathaa aitihaasik paddati donon kaa aadhaar liya jaataa he
 One has to define a period for description and at least two languages are required for comparison
 is prakaar, tulanaatmak paddati ko varnanaatmak paddati or aitihaasik paddati kaa yoga kaha ja saktaa he
 The comparative method can apply to any two languages
 jaise, bhartiya bhashaaon - bhojpuri aadi main bhi paraspar tulana kii jaati he yaa phir hindi-angareji, hindi-roosi, hindi-farsi kaa bhi tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 That is, there is no territorial limit
 wiliam jones, france bopp, maxmooler, curtius, ougust shlikhar prabhruti vidwaanon ne tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 However, so far there is a great lack of principles in comparative linguistics, on the basis of which the classification of two different languages could not become scientific
 sanrachanaatmak paddati varnanaatmak paddati kii agali kadi he
 This method is getting special publicity in America
 isamen yantric upkarnon ko adhik mahatva diya ja rahaa he, jisase anuwaad karne main vishesh suvidha hogi
 Jaelig Harris developed this method by writing a book titled 'methods in Structural Linguistics'
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon ke samaan bhashavigyaan ke bhi prayogtmak paksh hai, jinke liye prayog kii pranaaliyon or prayogshaala kii apeksha hoti he
 Phonetic phonology, physical phonology and auditory phonology are studied by various mechanical experiments
 ise praayogic swanvigyaan, yantric swanvigyaan yaa prayogshaala swanvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 In this, from simple equipment like mirrors to the most complex electrical devices are being used
 parinamswaroop bhashavigyaan ke kshetra main ganitagyon, bhautikashastriyon or enginiaron kaa purna sahyog apekshit ho gaya he
 With the help of the artificial palate and artificial palate projectors, the pronunciation space of the unmarked swans is tested by the individual
 kaaymograph swaanon kaa ghoshnatv or pranatv nirdhaaran karne anunasikta or kaalamaatra jaanane ke liye upyogi he
 Laryngeal scope studies the position of the larynx
 endoscope laringoscope kaa hi sudhara rup he
 The waves of the oscillograph imprint the physical appearance of the swans on the screen or on the film with great clarity
 yahi kaam spectograph yaa sonograph dwaara adhik safalataa se kiya jaataa he
 The images that the spectrograph presents can be heard again by pattern playback
 spichstrechar kii sahaayta se ricard kii hui saamagree ko dhimi gati se suna ja saktaa he
 Apart from these, there are other small and large instruments, from which adequate help is being taken in linguistic studies
 francisi bhashavaigyanikon main ruiyo ne swanvigyaan ke prayogon ke vishay main granth likhaa tha
 In London, Prof
 Firth developed a special palate
 swaron ke maapan ke liye jaise swaratrikon yaa chatushkon kii rekhaayen nirdhaarit kii gai hai, vaise hi inhone vyanjanon ke maapan ke liye aadhaar rekhaon kaa nirupan kiya, jinke dwaara uccharan sthanon kaa thik thik varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 Daniel Janse and Ida Ward have also done important work on English phonology
 francisi, german or roosi bhashaaon ke swanvigyaan par kaam karne waalon main kramash: armastrong, bithel or boyanas mukhya hai
 Among the people who work on theoretical and applied phonology equally, the following are the main ones: Stetson, Negus Potter, Green and Cop, Martin Juice, Hefner, Maul etc
 idhar ek nayaa yantric prayaas aarambh hua he jiskaa sambandh shabdaawalee, arthtatv tathaa vyakaranik roopon se he
 The use of electrical computers for mechanical translation is a special feature of the scientific era
 yah anuprayukt bhashavigyaan kaa atyant rochak or upadey vishay he
 For a detailed discussion, see Applied Linguistics
 radar vastuon kaa pataa lagane vaali ek pranali he jo sookshmatarangon kaa upyog karti he
 With its help, the distance, height, direction, speed, etc
 of moving objects such as aircraft, ships, motorcycles etc
 are known from a distance
 iske alaava mausam main teji se aa rahe parivartanon kaa bhi pataa chal jaataa he
 The term 'radar' is basically an acronym that was used by the US Navy in 1940 for 'radio detection and ranging'
 baad main yah sankshipt rup itnaa prachlit ho gaya ki angreji shabdaawalee main aa gaya or ab iske liye bade aksharon kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaataa
 a millionaire is a person who has a property of 1 lakh or more
 yah sampatti chal yaa achal dono prakaar kii ho sakati he
 Money, money, wealth, jewelery etc
 come under movable property and immovable property i
e
 property that stays in one place like land, house, building etc
 lakhpati shabd kaa upyog bharat or anya dakshin asian bhashaaon main adhik prachlit he kyonki lakh bhartiya ank maapan kii ek sankhya he
 The International Measurement System uses a "milliener", which is equal to 10,00,000
 sati, kuch puraatan bhartiya hindu samudaayon main prachlit ek aisi dharmik pratha thi, jisamen kisi purush kii mrityoparant uski patni uske antim sanskaar ke dauraan uski chita main swayamev pravisht hokar aatmatyag kar leti thi
 After the British declared it illegal in India in 1829, this practice almost ceased
 is pratha ko iskaa yah naam devi sati ke naam se mila he jinhen dakshayani ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to the Hindu religious texts, Goddess Sati had committed self-immolation by jumping in the fire of yajna, distressed by her father Daksha's disdain for her husband Mahadev Shiva
 sati shabd ko aksar akele yaa phir savitri shabd ke saath jodakar kisi "pavitra mahila" kii vyakhya karne ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he
 This was also one of the reasons for the practice of Sati in ancient times
 akramanakariyon dwaara jab purushon kii hatya kar di jaati thi, uske baad unki patniyaan apni asmita va atmasamman ko mahatvapurn samajhakar swayamev apane pati kii chita ke saath aatmatyag karne par vivash ho jaati thi
 Over time, due to the distortion of this voluntary compulsion of women, it became like a social practice, which came to be known as Sati practice
 brahm samaaj ke sansthaapak raja rammohan raay ne sati pratha ke viruddh samaaj ko jaagruk kiya
 As a result, this movement got a boost and the then English government was forced to enact a law to stop the practice of Sati
 antat: unhone san 1829 main sati pratha rokane kaa kanoon paarit kiya
 Thus came to an end the practice of sati from India
 vaastu tathaa sanrachana ejiniyari main stambh vah sanrachanaatmak avyav he jo swayan sampidit hokar apane upar aane vaale chat aadi kaa bhaar apane neeche ke avyavon par transfar kar detaa he
 Hence, the column is a compression element that stands vertically
 kintu bhucamp ejiniyari kii drushti se stambh kii dizin karte samay parshv balon ko sahane kii kshamta bhi di ja sakati he
 Pillars are often used to support the pickets and arcs
 aise electranik pravardhak ko shravy pravardhak yaa audio emplifire kehete hai jo kam shakti ke shravy sanketon kaa pravardhan kar saken
 The audio-frequency power amplifier is an electronic amplifier that amplifies low-power audio frequency electrical signals and makes them so powerful that they can drive the loudspeaker
 un sanketon ko shravy sanket kehete hai jinaki aavriti 20 hertz se lekar 20 hajaar hertz ke bich hoti he
 Only signals with frequencies within this range are heard by the human ear, not less or more than this
