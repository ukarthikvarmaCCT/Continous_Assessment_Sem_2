antat: hindi rashtrabhasha or devanagari rajalipi ghoshit hui
 In order to get Hindi the national language and 'vande Mataram' the national anthem, Tandon ji launched another campaign with his colleagues
 unhone karodon logon ke hastakshar or samarthan patr bhi ekatra kiye the
 It is also necessary to mention here that Tandon ji tried his best to give recognition to the civilian marks in the constitution, for this he left the institution which he served for almost five decades
 samvidhan-sabha main rajarshi ne angreji ankon kaa virodh kiya par nehru ji kii hidaayat ke kaaran congressi sadsy shri kanhaiyalaal maniklal munshi, shri gopal swami ingar ke formule ke paksh main rahe
 Tandon ji's protest motion fell and the civil issue could not be recognized in the constitution
 hindi ko rashtrabhasha or 'vandemaataram' ko raashtragit sweekrut karaane ke liye tandon ji ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath ek or abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 He had also collected signatures and letters of support from crores of people
 rajarshi ke vyaktitv evam krititv kaa akalan karte samay praaia: unke sahityakar rup ko andekha kar diya jaataa he
 He was the creator of a high court
 unki rachanaaon main tatkaaleen itihaas kii khoj kii ja sakati he
 As a litterateur, Tandon appears as an essayist, poet and journalist
 unke niabandh hindi bhashaa or sahitya, dharm or samskruti tathaa anya vividh kshetron se sambandhit hai
 Among the poetic compositions, 'bandar Sabha Epic', 'cottage Flower' and 'freedom' have their historical significance
 in kavitaaon main rashtriyata or deshbhakti kii pramukhataa he
 In his works, to find closely the poetics will have to be pierced, but the expression with which the Tandan ji has expressed the age-old reality is certainly praiseworthy - 'bandar sabha mahakavy` main aalha style main angrejon kii nitiyon kaa bhandaphod kiya he
 Enjoy one or two of the jokes he has taken against the British - patrakarita ke kshetra main tandon ji angreji ke bhi udbhat vidwaan the
 Shri Tribhuvan Narayan Singh ji has mentioned that when he was elected the President of the Congress in 1950, he wrote his address in Hindi and i did the English translation
 shri sampoornanand ji ne bhi us angreji anuwaad ko dekha, lekin jab tandon ji ne us anuwaad ko padhaa, to usamen kai pannon ko phir se likhaa
 Then i realized that while he was a learned scholar of Hindi, he also had great authority over English literature
 purushottams tandon ke bahu aiami or pratibhashali vyaktitv ko dekhakar unhen 'rajarshi` kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit kiya gaya
 On the evening of 15 April 1948, Mahanta Devaraha Baba honored you with the title of 'rajarshi' with a Vedic chant on the Saryu coast
 kuch logon ne ise anuchit tehraaya, par jyotirmath ke shri shankaracharya maharaj ne ise shastrasammat mana or kaashi kii pandit sabha ne 1948 ke akhil bhartiya saanskrithik sammelan ke oopaadhi vitaran samaaroh main isaki pushti kii
 Since then, this title has been embellished with its name inextricably linked
 bhartiya samskruti ke param himachati or pakshdhar hone par bhi rajarshi roodhiyon or andhvishwaason ke kattar virdohi the
 He also expressed his blunt thoughts on the evils and malpractices prevalent in Indian society
 unamem ek adbhut aatmbal tha, jisase ve kathin se kathin kaary ko aasaani se sampann kar lete the
 In relation to child marriage and widow marriage, he believed that "the promotion of widow marriage is contrary to our civilizational, our literature and the pativrat religion, the mainstay of our society organization"
 He clarified that the demand for widow-marriage is increasing because In our society, the system against child marriage has run and the question of child widows is the main problem of Indian society
 at: "bal-vivaah kii pratha ko rokna hi vidhwaa vivaah karne kii apeksha adhik mahatv kaa kartavya siddh hota he
 " unke vyaktitv ke is pahalu ke ek-do udhaaharan paryaapt honge- praaia: log samajhate hai ki pakaa hua bhojan supachya hota he, par rajarshi ne ise ek roodhi mana or unhone varshon tak aag se pake hue bhojan ko nahin grahan kiya
 Once left the Chinese food
 ek ore unhen gaay ke doodh se parhez tha to duusari ore chamade ke juute se
 Thus he was the holder of a wonderful personality
 bharatvarsh main swatantraaa ke purv se hi sampradayikta kii samasya apane vikat rup main vidyaman rahi
 Some leaders have also accused Tandonji of being communal
 yah sach he ki rajarshi apni samskruti ke param bhakt or poshak the
 He also did not feel hesitant to say that keeping two cultures alive in India would be a betrayal of the country, but this did not mean that Tandonji was communal, anti-muslim
 is sambandh main kulkusum ke vichaar kitne sarthak hai- Tandonji himself has also written- vastav main tandon ji kaa vyaktitv maanavvaadi tha
 The child who supported him at his home was a Muslim, but how ironic that people say that Tandonji was communal
 rajarshi tandon ji ke vyaktitv ke anya anek pahalu or bhi hai; jaise ve garibon, peediton ke sahaayak the, sahi arthon main deenabandhu the, karunaa kii murti the or babu ji kitne naitik aacharan ke vyakti the iskaa anumaan is udhaaharan se lagaaya ja saktaa he- "the year 1950 was Mahakumbh
 bahua ne ganga snaan ke liye gaadi se jane kii baat kahi
 Babu Ji replied that the car belonged to the 'speaker'
 tum mere saath to ja sakati ho, kintu akele nahin
 " uparyukt sankshipt vivechan ke baad yah kaha ja saktaa he ki rajarshi kaa vyaktitv bahuaiami or rajarshi ke anuroop tha
 He was rich in versatility
 ve hindi ke anany premi hi nahin, balki hindi ke paryaay the
 He is mentioned in the history of Hindi literature as an able poet and essay writer
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke amar sannaniyon main unki gananaa agrim pankti ke senaniyon main kii jaati he or unka naam bhartiya swantantraa sangram ke itihaas main swarna aksharon se ankit he
 He was the holder of the steel personality, despite being an affectionate, generous and compassionate idol
 himalay kii tarah achal or atal
 My heartfelt condolences to this supreme Hindi Savi, national devotee and worshiper of Indian culture

 The history of theater in India is very old
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki natyakala kaa vikaas sarvapratham bharat main hi hua
 There are some dialogues of Yama and Yami, Pururava and Urvashi etc
 in certain sutras of Rigveda
 in sanvaadon main log naatak ke vikaas kaa chihn pate hai
 It is estimated that drawing inspiration from these dialogues, the people composed the play and the play developed
 yathasamay bharatmuni ne use shastreey rup diya
 Bharata Muni in his Natyashastra has described the process of development of plays as follows: naatakon kaa vikaas chaahe jis prakaar hua ho, sanskrit sahitya main natya granth or tatsambandhi anek shastreey granth likhe gaye or sahitya main naatak likhane kii paripati sanskrit aadi se hoti hui hindi ko bhi praapt hui

 isi prakaar mahabharat main rangashaala kaa ullekh he or harivansh puraana tathaa ramayana main naatak khele jane kaa varnan he
 In spite of all this, it is not known for sure what kind of dramas were played and what were the forms of those pavilions

 bhitari bhaag main rangamanch kii vyavastha he
 It is made up of three stairs 2
3 meters wide, 75 cm from each other
 Are high
 chabutaron ke samane do chhed hai, jinamein shaayad baans yaa lakdi ke khambhe lagaakar parden lagaae jaaya karte the
 The venue for the audience is staircase like a Greek amphitheater
 yahan 50 vyakti baith sakate hai
 The nature of this primitive theater also matches the developed pattern described above
 bharat naatyashaastra se bhi hamen natyamandap ke pracheen swaroop kaa sanket miltaa he
 The pavilions of the tribals used to be secret, but the Aryans used to work only from the temporary tambunuma natyamandapas in accordance with their ashram civilization
 bharat naatyashaastra pehali athwa duusari shatee i
 main sankalit hua samajha jaataa he
 Bharata has adopted the shape of the Natyamandapas of both the tribals and the Aryans
 in donon ke sammishran se inhone natyamandapon ke jo rup nirdhaarit kiye, ve sarvatha bhartiya hai
 They do not seem to be related to the ancient Greek and Roman forms
 paashchaatya natyamandap khule maidaanon main banate the or unamem darshakon ke hetu seedhinuma ardhachandrakaar prekshasthaan banate the
 In contrast, in India, the Natyamandap was arranged in a house
 bharat ne teen prakaar ke natyamandapon kaa vidhaan bataaya he : vikrusht, chaturasr tathaa traysr 
 He then made three distinctions of these three: first, medium, and inferior
 inaki maap ke vishay ke die gaye nirdeshon ke anusaar jyeshtha kii lambaai lagbhag 51 meter, madhyam kii lagbhag 29 meter or avar kii lagbhag shmetre hogi
 The width of the Chatursara pavilion will be equal to the length and half of the length of the deformed
 bharat naatyashaastra ke anusaar natyamandap kii naap ke aadhaar anu, raj, bal, liksha, euka, yav, angulii, hast or dand hua karte the
 Thus a hand is 456 millimeters
 kautilya or panini ne maap ke jo aadhaar die hai, ve bhi inase milte hai
 Scholars believe that these bases must have been operational in this country after the Indus civilization, because the measurements found in that ancient civilization are the basis of the decimal system
 naatyashaala kaa praaia: aadhaar bhaag darshakon ke liye hota tha, jise prekshagrih kehete the; shesh aadhe main rangamandap hota tha
 The back half of the theater was used in the back
 shesh ke aadhe main saamne rangashirsh or peeche, nepathy kii ore, raganpith hota tha
 There were two doors on the edges, which probably did not cover the doors to get from the back of the street to the theater
 rangapith ke upar hi, chaar khambhon par chat rakhkar, mattavarani banaai jaati thi
 Mattavarani probably represents the attic
 khambhon par praaia: hathi ke sir ke sadrush bani ghodiyon ke upar yah chat rahati thi, isi se ise mattavarani kehete the
 The auditorium was built in a staircase
 in sidhiyon main se prayek 1 haath unchi hoti thi or usapar lakdi ke patare bhi laga karte the, shaayad usee prakaar ke jaise roman theatron main hote the
 There is also a law to decorate the walls inwards
 bharat ke anusaar bhit par acha bhittilep chadhaanaa chahie
 Scholars believe that leva was mixed by mixing soil and husk
 ise petakar samtal kiya jaataa tha
 Then a layer of lime was plated, which was rubbed and smoothed
 iske upar shankh piskar chadhaate the or paalish karte the
 Beautiful paintings were done on these walls
 natyamandap main deevaaron ke saath khambhe banaakar upar chat banaai jaati thi
 Lamps were used for lighting at night
 bahut se dipakon ke atirikt shaayad mashaal se bhi kaam liya jaataa rahaa hoga
 There was probably no provision for sound control and expansion; Therefore, the theaters were also very small
 bhartiya prekshagrih aakaar main greek prekshagrihon kii apeksha, jo bahudhaa khule hua karte the, bahut chote hote the
 The shape and decoration of the Natyamandapa given in Bharata Natyashastra makes it known that till that time the primary form of Natyamandapa of the tribals of India, which we find in Sitavanga Cave, Hathigumpha, and Fulumai Cave near Nasik, the oldest of Aryans
 In the form of wooden houses and a combination of both, a new structure was formed
 yahi nahin, natyamandap ke rup ke vishay main niyam bhi ban chuke the tathaa unpar dharm kaa niyantran bhi prarambh ho chukaa tha
 These rules were so stringent that the breaking of the measuring rope and the defect of a single pillar was beginning to be considered as an indicator of the death of the lord of Natyamandap
 bharat ke samay tak bhartiya rangamanch is mahaan sansar kaa dyotak mana jane laga tha, jahaan stri-purush pravisht hokar apni purvanishchit lila karte hai tathaa uski samaapti par yahan se vidaa lete hai
 The history of modern Indian theatrical literature is not more than a century old
 islam dharm kii kattarta ke kaaran naatak ko mughal kaal main us prakaar kaa protsaahan nahin mila jis prakaar kaa protsaahan anya kalaon ko mughal shaskaon se praapt hua tha
 Due to this, in the two and a half hundred years of the Mughal period, the Indian schools of theater or auditoriums were completely erased
 parantu ram lila aadi kii tarah lok kala ke madhyam se bhartiya theatre jivit rahi angrejon kaa prabhutv desh main vyaapt hone par unke desh kii anek vastuon ne hamaare desh main pravesh kiya
 Western plays were also entered for their entertainment
 un logon ne apane naatakon ke abhinay ke liye yahan abhinayashaalaaon kaa sangyojan kiya, jo theatre ke naam se adhik vikhyath hai
 The first theater of this manner, it is said, was built in Calcutta, long before the Battle of Palasi
 ek doosraa theatre 1795 i
 main khulaa
 Its name was 'lefed Fair'
 iske baad 1812 i
 main 'ethinium' or duusare varsh 'chaurangi' theatre khule
 Thus Bengal first came into contact with Western theater and gave a new look to theater for its plays on the simulation of Western theater

 Variance is a measure in terms of probability and statistics that shows how scattered the given data are
 yadi sabhi aankade samaan hon to prasaran kaa maan shunya hoga
 If the variance value is low, it indicates that all figures are very close to the mean
 prasaran ko praayah Var, σ x 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ sigma _{X}^{2}}, yaa keval σ2 se nirupit kiya jaataa he
 For many values of the same variable amount, the variance value is derived as follows: jahaan: Clearly, variance mathematically is equal to the square of the standard deviation
 yadi is paribhaasha ko kisi yadruchh char par lagu karen, jiskaa samaantar madhya μ = e he, to iskaa prasaran Var nimnlikhit prakaar se paribhaashit hoga- By further expanding this definition, we get the following alternative definition of variance - mana n = 5 { \ displaystyle n=5} sankhyaayein {-4, -1, 1, 2, 7} di hui hai

 Their demand was that Chandigarh should be the capital of Punjab only, Punjabi-speaking areas should be included in Punjab, Supreme Court opinion should be taken on the issue of river water, 'headworks of canals' and management of basic infrastructure for hydro-electricity generation

 Harsole's inscription of 949 suggests that Seyak also accepted the dominion of the Rashtrakutas early in his kingdom

 kalyani jail main ek qaidi he jisapar khun kaa ilzaam he
 In prison, an old prisoner gets tuberculosis and Kalyani agrees to take care of him voluntarily
 budhiya kaa ilaaj karte karte jail ke doctor devendra ko kalyani se pyaar ho jaataa he lekin kalyani apane ateet ke kaaran uske pyaar ko thukraa detii he
 Devendra returns from his prison job and returns to his home
 us jail ke jailer mahesh or devendra ke gharelu sambandh hone ke kaaran devendra jailer ko apane pyaar ke bare main bataa detaa he
 After Devendra leaves, the jailer calls Kalyani and asks Kalyani to recount herself
 jab kalyani yah kahati he ki uskaa ateet itnaa du:kha bharaa he ki vah bol nahin paayegi to jailer usase apni kahani likh kar dene ko kahata he
 Now the film goes back into the past and Kalyani reveals that her father was working as a postmaster in a village and that she had lost her mother and elder brother
 unke gaanv main ek swatantraaa senaanee bikaash ghosh nazarband hota he or donon ko aapas main pyaar ho jaataa he
 Bikash leaves Kalyani, promising to get married when he returns but never returns again
 gaanv waalon ke apane pita ko diye jane vaale taanon se tang aakar ek din kalyani gaanv chhodkar shahar aa jaati he jahaan use ek aspataal main naukaraani kii naukari mil jaati he
 He is entrusted with the care of a half-mad woman who keeps calling him bad enough
 ek din uski usee shahar main rahane vaali sakhi aakar bataati he ki kalyani ke pita use khojate huye uske ghar aaye the or phir jab aspataal aane ke liye nikle to ek motor se takaraa gayi hai lekin jab tak ve donon kalyani ke pita ko dekhne ke liye duusare aspataal pahunchati hai tab tak ve dam tod chuke hote hai
 When Kalyani comes back to her hospital, she sees that the husband of the half-mad woman is Bikash
 krodh main aakar vah us mahila ko chaay main zehar milakar pilaa detii he jisase uski maut ho jaati he or kalyani apana jurm qabool kar leti he
 The film then arrives in the present and Kalyani is released with the efforts of the jailer

 Not coming
 Not only because of this "financial problem", anti-social problems like "poverty", "domestic violence", "crime" and "corruption" are taking terrible form in the society, due to which our Received life upside-down is becoming busy l "vittiya shiksha" se hamaare "vichaaron" main badlaav aayega, jisase hamaare "kaam" badal jaayenge or jab hamaare kaam badal jaayenge tab hamaare "parinaam" bhi badal jaayenge l kyonki ham ek hi kaam ko baar-baar karte hai or har baar alag parinaam kii apeksha karte rahete hai kintu hamaare parinaam nahin badalte l atah yadi hamen apane jindagi ke "parinaam" badalane he to hamen "kaam" badalane honge or "kaam" tabhi badalenge jab hamaare "vichaar" badalenge l is tarah jab hamaare "vittiya-vichaar" main badlaav aayega tab "samaaj" main bhi vittiya badlaav aayega or jab hamaara samaaj vittiya rup se prashikshit hoga, tab hamaara desh bhi vittiya rup se majboot ho jaayegaa, jisase na sirf hamaara balki hamaare desh kaa aarthik swarup hi badal jaayegaa l jahaan "vittiya-samasya" kii nahin, "vittiya-samaadhaan" kii sthiti nirmit ho jaaegi, joki sirf or sirf "vittiya-shiksha" se hi sambhav he l To promote "financial education" means "helping people to solve their financial problems" !! It is both our duty and duty to expand "financial-education" so that we as well as the economic welfare of all, and solve the growing "financial-problems" of the present and future

 manorog vigyaan yaa manorog vidya chikitsa kshetra kii ek visheshgyata he jo manovikaron kaa adhyayan karti he
 Psychology is a new science of the modern era
 20veen sadi main hi is vigyaan ke vibhinn angon main mahatv kii khojein hui hai
 Till the 19th century, various types of psychosis were considered diseases that had no relation to the general practitioner
 jatil manovikar kii avasthaa main rogi ko maansik chikitsaalayon main rakh diya jaataa tha, taaki vah samaaj ke duusare logon kaa koi nuksaan na kar sake
 There was no special treatment in these hospitals
 chikitsakon ko vastav main uski chikitsa ke vishay main spasht gyaan hi na tha ki chikitsa kaise kii jaay
 Now the situation has changed
 manovikar vigyaan ko ek andhiyaari kothri nahin maan liya gaya he, jiskaa sambandh thode se manoveekshipt logon se he, varan yah vigyaan itnaa mahatv kaa vishay mana gaya he ki iskaa samuchit gyaan na keval kushal shaareerik chikitsak ko, varan samaaj ke prayek sevak or kaaryakarta, shikshak, samajasudharak tathaa raajnneetik netaa ko bhi hona aavashyak he
 Not only this, every well-educated citizen also needs its knowledge
 yadi koi prabal manovikar man main aa gaya or hamen uskaa gyaan nahin hua, to ham usase mukt hone ke liye kisi visheshgy kii sahaayta bhi na le sakenge
 Any person, who is perfectly healthy and whose wisdom is praised by all people, can become deranged by losing the balance of his mind at any time
 phir vah samaaj ke liye nikamma ho jaataa he
 a person should know such situations so that he does not fall into some kind of extraordinary mental state, that is, he does not suffer from mental illness
 phir maansik chikitsa karaane ke liye bhi manovikar vigyaan main shraddha hona aavashyak he
 Psychological science developed to meet the special needs of humans
 yah 20veen shatabdi kii ek vishesh dein kaa parinaam he
 In this century, there has been an unthinkable increase in the efficiency and happiness of human beings
 uski taarkik shakti or vaigyanik chamatkaar atyadhik bad gaye hai
 Along with this, his mental activities have increased many times already
 yah kori bakawaad nahin hai ki pratibha or paagalpan ek duusare ke poorak hai
 Along with intellectual development, dementia also develops
 vigyaan sukhad samagriyon main vruddhi karata he, to du:khad paristhitiyon kaa bhi srijan karata he
 It creates a new mental confusion as well as a reconciliation of external conditions
 ek ore vigyaan manushya kii suraksha badha detaa he, to duusari ore achintya chintaaon ko bhi utpann kar detaa he
 Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the 20th century is a century of insanity
 yadi isane veikshiptata ko badhaayaa he, to uske shaman ke vishesh upaay khojna bhi isi kaa kaam he
 As much as the country is progressing in civilization, there are more anti-cancer doctors and hospitals in it
 atev manovikaron ke nivaaran hetu anek prakaar kii manovaigyanik khojein maanavvigyaan ke vibhinn kshetron main ho rahi he
 Before Dr
 Freud, doctors used to use only physical medicines for the treatment of mental diseases
 kuch log in rogon ko shant karne ke liye tantropchaar kaa upyog karte the
 Belief and instruction are the basis of mechanism
 aaj bhi is vidhi kaa upyog gramin ashikshit logon main adhiktar hota he
 The famous Belgian psychologist Dr
 Messmer made extensive use of hypnosis and instruction in the treatment of mental diseases
 isse manojaat shaareerik rogon kaa bhi nivaaran hota tha
 Scholars named Braun Heim and Sharco of France showed the usefulness of Sammohan in monsoon
 rogi apni sanmohit avasthaa main dabi maansik bhaavana ko ugal detaa tha or is prakaar ke rechan se vah rogamukt bhi ho jaataa tha
 Dr
 Emile Couyé of Nenson, France, used instruction in the treatment of mental diseases, but not all these methods led to a special advancement of psychiatry
 iske liye man kaa gambhir prayogtmak adhyayan karnaa aavashyak tha
 This work was done by Dr
 Freud
 ab yah mana jane laga ki man kii vibhinnataaon kaa gyaan kiye bina or unamem chalanevaali prakriyaaon ke jane bina kisi bhi vyakti ko uske manovikar se mukt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to Dr
 Freud there are three levels of the mind: conscious, subconscious and unconscious
 man teen prakaar ke kaary bhi karata he : ichchhaaon kaa nirmaan, unka niyantran or unki santushti
 The first work is of the dependent mind, the second work is of the moral mind and the third work is of the ego
 ichchhaaon kaa janm praaia: achetan str par hota he, unka niyantran avchetan par or unki santushti chetan str par hoti he
 Conflict often goes on in the human mind and moral mind
 jab yah sangharsh manushya kii chetana main chalata he, tab vah du:khadaayak chaahe jitna bhi ho par rog kaa kaaran nahin banataa, kintu jab prayatnpurvak kathorta se kisi prabal ichha kaa daman naitik man ke dwaara ho jaataa he, tab sangharsh maansik chetana ke str par na hokar manushya ke achetan man main hone lagata he
 The existence of this struggle is mental disease and freeing the person from this struggle is his mental therapy, which is the goal of psychiatry
 iske liye rogi ko maansik shithilikaran kii avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he or phir use apane apriy athwa aniatik anubhavon ko samaran karne kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 For this, some people still use the Sammohan method, but Freud used to psychoanalyze the patient
 is vidhi main rogi ko shant or shithil avasthaa main laakar man main aanevaale sabhi vichaaron or chitron ko kehete jane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 In this way, sometimes the patient tells very unpleasant experiences
 jab ve anubhav puure sajiv ho jate hai or rogi unke anusaar lajja, glani, harsh, vishaad kaa usee prakaar anubhav karata he, jaisaa pehali baar kiya tha, tab uske bhaavon kaa rechan ho jaataa or rog ke anek lakshan samaapt ho jate hai
 The patient does not benefit from blank intellectual memory, but from living memory of old experiences, that is, emotional memory
 jab kisi damit bhav kaa rechna hota he, tab vah pehle pahal maansik chikitsak par hi aropit ho jaataa he
 It is absolutely necessary for the patient to have affection towards the doctor to come out of the feeling
 jab tak rogi or chikitsak main hriday kii ekta nahin hoti, damit ichha avchetana ke str par aati hi nahin
 Then this affection increases day by day
 jaise jaise chikitsak par rogi kii shraddha badhati jaati he, uskaa rog kam hota jaataa he
 While getting rid of his disease, the patient loves the doctor very much
 is pyaar kaa badhanaa or rogamukti ek hi tathy ke do pahalu hai
 Now it is the duty of the physician to turn the impulse of the love of the patient to its proper character, or to use it in some constructive work
 chikitsak rogi ko bhavatmak rachanaavlamban praapt karaane kaa prayaas karata rahata he
 He encourages him to increase his knowledge
 rogi ko rogamukt tabhi samajha ja saktaa he, jab vah na keval rog ke sabhi lakshanon se mukt ho gaya ho, varan use bhavatmak swaavlamban or aatm sujh praapt ho gaye hon
 Psychology is the means to attain this mood
 maansik chikitsavigyaan kii nai khojein manovigyaan ke atirikt duusari dishaao main bhi hui hai
 There are two main among these: maansik rogi ke man main sangharsh chalate rahane ke kaaran vah anidra kaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 Now if such a person is put to sleep in any way, then it is possible that his disease becomes light
 maansik rogi ko do sthalon par sadaa ladate rahanaa padataa he, ek bhitari or duusari bahari
 He has external and internal worries

 Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 july Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 july 2011

 iskaa vikaas khuli pranali atanrasampark upkram ke taur par kiya gaya tha
 By default, it divides the network structure into seven layers, from top to bottom in order, application, presentation, session, traffic, network, content-link, and physical layer
 atah ise aksar "oesai saat parati pratimaan" bhi kaha jaataa he
 Each layer is a group of theoretically similar functions, which serve the layer above it and receive services from the layer below it
 har parat main ek "drushtaant" upar vaali parat ke drushtaanton ko seva pradaan karata he or neeche vaali paraton se seva karne kaa anurodh karata he
 For example, the layer that provides a flawless connection to a mesh provides the desired path to the applications above and to do this it requests a bundle from the lower layer so that the contents of the path can be created
 siddhanthata ek parat main maujuud do drushtaant aapas main sampark karne ke liye usee parat ke ek samastareey navachaar judaav kaa istemaal karte hai
 There are mainly two reasons for using the OSI model: 1977 main jaal sanrachana ke paratdaar pratimaan par kaam shuru hua or antarrashtriya maanakeekaran sanghathan ne apane oesai dhaanche kii sanrachana shuru kii
 There are two main pieces of OSI: a sentential pattern for nets, called the original reference pattern or seven spatial patterns, and some special innovation
 dhyaan de: oesai pratimaan ko varnit karne vaale maanak dastaavaz itiu-tii kii X
200 shrunkhlaa kii sifaarishon ke naam se muft utaare ja sakate hai
 The ITU-X series also has specifications for several innovations
 oesai pratimaan ke samatuly iesao / iisi maanak iesao uplabdh karata he, lekin sabhi muft nahin hai
 All aspects of the OSI structure evolved through experiences with the Cyclades network, which also affected the structure of the Internet
 nai sanrachana ko iesao 7498 va uske kai parishishton main pralekhith kiya gaya
 In this model, the mesh system is divided into layers
 har parat main ek yaa adhik ikai parat kii kaaryon ko lagu karti he
 Each unit interacts directly with the layer just below it and prepares and provides facilities for the use of the layer above it
 ek mejabaan main maujuud ek ikai, duusare mejabaan kii usee parat main maujuud samaan ikai se sampark saadhane ke liye nawacharon kaa istemaal karti he
 Service definitions provide an emotional description of the features provided layer by layer
 bhautik parat upkarnon kii vidyutiya va bhautik vinirdesh paribhaashit karti he
 It specifically defines the relationship between an instrument and a physical medium
 isamen pin, voltage, cabel vinirdesh, jaal hub, ripeter, jaal card, mezbaan bas adapter va anya chizon kii jamaavat shaamil he
 To understand the difference between a material-hardened layer and a physical layer, note that the physical-layer is primarily concerned with the specification of a device with a medium, whereas the content-hardened layer is primarily concerned with the specification of multiple devices with a common medium
 Is bhautik parat kisi upkaran ko yah bataati he ki kisi madhyam ko kuch preshan kaise kiya jaae, yaa usase kaise kuch praapt kiya jaae 
 Standards such as RS-232 actually use physical wiring to control access to the medium
 bhautik parat dwaara pradutt pramukh sevaayen va suvidhaayen hai - Parallel SCSI buses fall under this layer, although it is worth noting that the logical SCSI innovation is the innovation of the traffic layer, which runs over this bus
 kii bhautik parat ethernet navachaar bhi isi parat main hai, ethernet is parat va saamagree-kadi parat dono main aata he
 The same applies to other local-area networks, such as Token Ring, FDDI, ITU-T G
HN and IEEE 820

 nijee kshatra jaalon par bhi yah lagu hoti he jaise ki nildant va iiqui 820

 The material link layer provides a functional and procedural method for exchanging materials between mesh units, as well as detecting and correcting possible errors in the physical layer
 shuruyaat main yah parat bindu-se-bindu va bindu-se-bahubindu madhyamon ke liye thi, jo ki dhoorbhaash pranali main vishaal kshetra madhyamon kii visheshta hoti he
 The local regional network structure, which also included broadcast-capable multi-access media, developed under IEEE Project 802, in addition to the work of ISO
 iiqui ne up-parateekaran va prabandhikaran kaaryon par jor diya, jinaki dablyueen main zarurat nahin thi
 In modern times, only hard-to-find innovations are present in material innovations, but flow control is not controlled through sliding window
 nawacharon ke udhaaharan hai bindu-se-bindu navachaar 
 IEEE 802
2 LLC is not used in most local area networks for most Ethernet innovations
 sthaneey kshetra jaalon main iske bahaav niyantranon va pavati yuktiyon kaa bahut kam istemaal hota he
 Slot window flow control and acknowledgment are used in traffic layer innovations such as TCP
 iskaa istemaal kuch khaas jagahon par abhi bhi hota he jahaan eks
25 ke jariye zyaada tezi milti he
 The ITU-T G
HN standard, which provides a fast local field mesh over existing wires, provides an entire material link layer with both error correction and drift control through selective repetitive fenestration innovation
 dablyooee va aleen sevaayen - dono hi bhautik parat se bit yojit karke taarkik anukramon banaati hai, jinhen dhaanchaa kehete hai
 Not all bits of the physical layer go into the structure, as some bits are only for pure physical layer functions
 udhaaharan ke liye affdidiai bit dhara kii har paanchavi bit kaa istemaal parat nahin karti he
 Connection-oriented WAN content engagement innovations, in addition to creating frameworks, can find and fix errors
 ye prasaaran dar ko bhi niyantrit kar sakate hai
 The WAN can implement a material mobilization layer sliding obturator flow control and acknowledgment system to provide a reliable distribution of structures - the same happens in SDLC and HDLC, and in LAPB and LAPD derived from HDLC
 vyaavhaarik, judaavheen aleen kii shuruyaat iiqui ke purv kii ethernet vinirdesh ke saath shuru hue
 This specification is the ancestor of IEEE 802

 Obsolete MAC layers count token rings and fddis
 emesi up-parat trutiyaan pakad to letaa he par unhen thik nahin karata he
 The mesh layer provides material and process related transfer of material of different lengths from source to destination through one or more nets
 yah karte hue, jaal parat, yatayaat parat dwaara anurodhit seva gunvattta ko barkaraar rakhata he
 The mesh layer acts as a mesh routing and can also perform fragmentation and linking, and also detail distribution errors
 anumaark is parat main kaam karte hai
 They make it possible to send content to a wide network
 yah ek taarkik sambodhan vidhi he - mulyon kaa chayan jaal abhiyantaa dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The addressing method is hierarchical
 parat 3 ke navachaar kii sabase acha udhaaharan he antarjaal navachaar 
 It manages the seamless transfer of content, with one jump at a time - from the initial system to the entry routers, then from the routers to the routers and then from the exit routers to the target final system
 agle oochaal tak vishwasaneey vitaran isaki jimmedaari nahin he, jimmedaari he keval truti vaale pulindon kaa pataa lagaana taaki ve hataa die ja saken
 If the next bounce medium cannot accept a truss of the current length, then the IP is responsible for making this truss a number of smaller trunks so that the medium can accept them
 parat prabandhan navachaar ke kai kaary, jo ki prabandhan parishisht, iesao 7498 / 4 main paribhaashit hai, jaal parat kaa hissaa hai
 These include routing innovation, multi-broadcast group management, network layer information and error, and naming the layer layer address
 pelod kaa kaary inhen jaal parat kaa sadsy banaata he, inhen le jane vaala navachaar nahin
 The traffic layer exchanges content between users and provides reliable content transfer services to the upper layers
 yatayaat parat kisi bhi kadi kii vishwasaneeyata ko niyantrit karti he, iske liye bahaav niyantran, vibhaajan / avibhaajan or truti niyantran kaa istemaal hota he
 Some innovations are situated and engagement oriented
 iskaa matlab yah he ki yatayaat parat vibhaajanon kaa hisaab rakh sakati he or jahaan truti aae unhen phir se bhej sakati he
 While these are not subject to the OSI context model nor fully satisfy the OSI definition of the traffic layer, but still some examples of layer 4 are distribution control innovation and user data innovation
 vaastavik oesai nawacharon main paanch prakaar ke judaav-aadhaarit yatayaat navachaar hai - kaksha 0 se le ke kaksha 4 
 Class 0 does not contain an error exit rule and was designed for mesh layers that can provide impeccable association
 kaksha 4 tisipi ke sabase kareeb he, halaanki tisipi main kuch suvidhaayen hai jo oesai satr parat main maanata he jaise ki sukhad samaapti
 Also, all OSITP connection-based innovation classes provide instant content and protection boundaries protection, TCP cannot do anything in either
 tipi0-4 kakshaon ke bare main vistaar se jaankaree is talika main he - Perhaps a good way of thinking about the traffic layer would be to compare it to the post office, which does the remittance and classification of received letters
 lekin yaad rakhen ki daakkhaana keval chitthee ke lifaafe ke hisaab se prabandhan karata he
 High-level layers can handle double envelopes, such as camouflaged presentation services that only the final recipient can disguise
 duusari tarah se kahen to surangi navachaar yatayaat parat main hote hai, jaise ki gair-ypi navachaar - ibiem kaa esene yaa navel kaa ai pi jaal par chalane vaala ipex yaa ipisek ke jariye purna chadmikaran
 The simple routing encapsulation mesh layer may have an innovation, but if the encapsulation of the payload is only at the endpoint, the GRE IP header is used, but still the whole infrastructure or bundle becomes a one-time traffic innovation
 el2tipi ek yatayaat pulindia main pipipi dhaanche le jaataa he
 The session layer controls the interactions between computers
 yah sthaneey va duurastha anuprayog ke bich judaav sthapit, prabandhit va samaapt karata he
 It performs a full-duplex, half-duplex, or unidirectional action, and establishes the process of test pointing, postponement, termination, and restart
 oesai pratimaan ne is parat ko satron kii sukhad samaapti kii jimmedaari di he jo ki vitaran niyantran navachaar kii khubi he, yah satr jaanch bindukaran va ugaahi kaa bi kaam karata he jo ki aamtaur par antarjaal nawacharon main nahin hota he
 The session layer is typically applied specifically to application environments in which remote method calls are used
 prastutikaran parat anuprayog parat ikaayiyon ke bich sandarbh sthapit karti he, gimen upree parat vaali ikaiyaan alag alag vaakya vinyas va arth vigyaan kaa istemaal kar sakati hai, basharte prastutikaran seva dono ke bich maanchitran karne main samarth ho
 The presentation service content units are then converted into session innovation content units and thus transported to the bottom of the stack
 yah parat saamagree pratinidhitiv main fark se mukti detaa he - anuprayog va jaal praaroop main adla badali kar ke
 The presentation layer presents the content in such a way that the application layer can accept it
 yah parat jaal main bheje jane vaali saamagree kaa praroopan va chadmikaran karata he, taaki visangati kii dikkat na aae
 It is also often called syntax layer
 mul prastutikaran dhaanchaa bhavatmak vaakya vinyas sanketan ek kaa istemaal karata tha, isamen ibisidiisi-paath sanchika ko eessiaiai sanchika main badalanaa, yaa vastuon ko dharawahit kar ke exmel yaa iskaa ulta karnaa shaamil hai
 The application layer is the layer of OSI that is closest to the user, that is, both the OSI application layer and the user directly contact the application application directly
 yah parat un tantransh anuprayogon se sampark karte hai jo kisi samparkrat tukdon ko lagu karte hai
 Such application programs fall outside the limits of the OSI paradigm
 anuprayog parat ke kaaryaklap praayah hote hai, sanchaar bhagidaaron ko pahchaanana, sansadhano kii uplabdhta pataa lagaana or sanchaar ko samakaleen bananaa
 When locating communication partners, the application layer has to ascertain who the contact partners are and whether they are available for any application that wants to transmit content
 sansaadhan uplabdhta pataa karte samay anuprayog parat ko yah faisalaa karnaa hota he ki anurodhit sanchaar ke liye paryaapt jaal sansaadhan uplabdh hai yaa nahin
 All communication between applications requires collaboration, which is managed by the application layer, making the communication synchronous
 anuprayog parat ke kuch karyanvit udhaaharan hai tailnet, unnatapath sthanantaran navachaar, sanchika sthanantaran navachaar, va saral dak sthanantaran navachaar 
 None of the OSI reference patterns or OSI innovations specify any programming interface
 ye bas keval seva kii bhavatmak nirdishtitaayen hi pradaan karte hai
 The innovation specifications explicitly specify the interface between different computers, but the protocol specifications within a computer are different for each implementation
 udaahranarth microsaft windos kaa vinsa or unics kaa barkali socket tathaa pranali 5 kii yatayaat parat antaraprishth, anuprayogon va yatayaat ke bich ke antaraprishth hai
 NDIS and ODI are the interface between medium and web innovation
 bhautik parat se madhyam ke alaava, baaki sabhi antaraprishth maanak, lagbhag oesai seva nirdashtataaon ke hi karyanyavyan hai
 The innovations in the TCP / IP paradigm of Internet innovations are not deliberately divided into separate layers like the OSI paradigm
 arefasi3439 main "parateekaran nuksaandeh mana gaya" naam kaa ek vibhaag he
 But still TCP / IP identifies four thick layers based on activity, based on the scope of operation of the innovations contained in them
 ye daayre hai tantransh anuprayog, ant-se-ant yatayaat judaav, antarjaleey dayera or antat kshetreey jaal main anya grathiyon ke saath sidhe judaav kaa dayera
 This hypothesis differs from OSI, yet it has similar comparisons to the OSI reacquisition method: the Internet application layer consists of the osi's application layer, the presentation layer, and most of the session layer
 ant-se-ant yatayaat parat main oesai satr parat kii sundar samaapti suvidha va oesai yatayaat parat shaamil hai
 The interconnect layer is a subset of the OSI network layer and the link layer consists of the OSI network-link and physical layers, as well as many parts of the OSI network layer
 in paraton kaa aadhaar iesao 7498 ke mul saat-partiya navachaar pratimaan he, na ki jaal parat dastauez ke aantarik sanghathan main sudhaar aadi
 The client / consumer layers are described fairly rigorously in OSI, but they are not at odds with the case of TCP / IP, as there is no need to follow the hierarchy of the paradigm paradigm for the use of innovations
 aise udhaaharan kuch anumaargan nawacharon main bhi hai, yaa phir surangikaran nawacharon ke varnan main bhi he, ye kisi anuprayog ke liye kadi parat pradaan karte hai, jabaki ho saktaa he ki surang mejabaan navachaar apane aap main yatayaat yaa anuprayog parat hi ho
 The structure of TCP / IP generally prefers decisions based on simplicity, effectiveness and ease of implementation
 saanchaa:iso standards The maxillary sinus or vertical airwaves are air filled cavities in the skulls of the human body that lighten our head and moisturize the air we breathe
 jab kabhi sinus kaa sankraman ho jaataa he to ye sirdard kaa bhi kaaran banate hai
 But sinuses are not the cause of all headaches, at times the patient may have migraine or tension headache instead of sinus pain
 adhakapari sirdard se chehre kii nasen prabhavit ho jaati hai
 Which go to the forehead, cheeks and jaw

 This is called sinusitis
 yadhyapi kai baar yah mahatvapurn baat hoti he ki kai sirdard to lambey samay se chale aa rahe hai, nazle ke kaaran hote hai
 Therefore, whenever you treat a migraine, be sure to keep a sinus headache in mind
 vastav main sinus ke sankraman hone par sinus kii jhilli main sujan aa jaati he
 Due to swelling, pus or mucus gets filled in the sinuses instead of air, due to which the sinuses are closed
 is vajah se maathe par, gaalon va upar ke jabaade main dard hone lagata he or sinus sirdard kaa kaaran banate hai
 Headache is aggravated by bending forward and lying down
 is sirdard ko kam karne ke liye sinus kii sujan ko kam karke mawaad va balgam ko nikaala jaataa he
 There are inexpensive ways to reduce sinus headaches, such as: sinus sirdard agar ukt saavdhaaniyon aadi se thik na ho to doctor se jaanch karwaani chahie taaki sirdard kaa sadaa ke liye ilaj ho sake or agar sirdard aadi kaa kaaran migraine ho to uskaa davaaiyaan aadi lekar ilaj karwaanaa chahie
 If there is any nasal bone and sinus disease by getting X-ray, city scan and allergy test etc
, then the patient must have binocular operation
