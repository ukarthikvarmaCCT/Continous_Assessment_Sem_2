 This longitude is considered Greenwich Mean Time / Prime Meridian
 All 180 ° longitudes east of this line are called longitude and all 180 ° longitudes in the west are called western longitudes
 Normally the eastern longitude is directed by e and western longitudes are directed by W
 There is a difference of 4 minutes between the two longitudes, that is, the Earth takes 4 minutes to rotate 1 ° longitude
 At 15 ° the Earth takes 1 hour

 This line is not straight, because in order to maintain the same time in the east and west countries, this line has been tilted to the east in many places and to the west in many places
 For example, tilting east to 661⁄2 ° north to keep a time in the Bering Strait and eastern Siberia
 521⁄2° uttar main pashchim kii ore jhukaav, alyusian dweep evam alaska main ek hi samay darshane ke liye

 Dev has the distinction of great poet under Brajbhasha poetry of Hindi
 unka puraa naam devdatt tha
 He was born in the Hindi language
 yadhyapi ye pratibha main bihari, bhushan, matiram aadi samakaleen kaviyon se kam nahin varan kuch badhkar hi siddh hote hai, phir bhi inkaa kisi ek vishisht rajdurbar se sambandh na hone ke kaaran inaki waisi khyaati or prasiddhi nahin hui
 Among the writers who have made Dev highly famous, Mishrabandhu is whose idea that Dev's place in Hindi literature comes after Tulsi
 dev or bihari main koun adhik shreshth he isko lekar ek vivaad bhi chalaa tha
 In this connection, the book 'dev and Bihari' was written by Pandit Krishnabihari Mishra and 'bihari and Dev' was written by Lala Bhagwadin
 in donon main dev or bihari kii kavypratibha ko spasht karne kaa praytn he
 Although six-seven poets named 'dev' are found under Hindi literature, other than the famous poet Dev, other poets named 'dev' did not get any special fame
 prasiddh dev kavi kaa janm san
 1730 main hua tha
 These Dyusaria Kanyakubj Dwivedi were Brahmins
 inkaa nivasasthaan itawa tha, jaisaa 'bhavvilas' kii nimnlikhit pankti se spasht hota he- His birth anniversary is also confirmed on the basis of 'bhavavilas', which he composed in Samvat 1746
 vah doha is prakaar he- Dev did his creations by staying at several shelters
 inaki rachana 'ashtyam' aurangzeb ke putr aajamshah ke sanket par hui thi or usne unhen puraskrit bhi kiya tha
 Perhaps 'bhavavilas' is also written in the shelter of Azam Shah
 dev ke duusare ashrayadata dadripati raja seetaram ke bhattije bhavanidutt vaisya the
 These Charkhi were residents of Dadri
 inke liye inhone 'bhavanivilas' naamak granth likhaa
 Dev's third refuge was Kushal Singh
 ye faphund ke rahanevaale the or dev ne inke liye 'kushalvilas' naamak granth kii rachana kii
 Dev's real qualities - customers and refugees were Raja Bhogilal, for whom he composed a book called 'rasavilas'
 inke sambandh main dev ne apane rasvilas main likhaa he- Dev's work 'premchandrika' is dedicated to Udyot Singh, son of Rao Mardansingh of Dyondia Khede
 'sujanvinod' kii rachana dilli ke rais pathiram ke putr sujanmani ke liye hui
 His final work 'sukhsagar Tarang' was written in the shelter of Ali Akbar Khan, the King of Pihani
 dev kii bahusankhyak rachanaaon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 Some say the number of his texts is 72 and some people 52
 parantu inke pramanik granth, jo praapt hote hai, 18 hai
 The other nine texts are also mentioned by his name and thus a total of 27 texts match his name
 nirvivaad rup se jin 18 granthon ko devkrut sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he ve is prakaar hai- Handwritten texts are - devkrut ek sanskrit granth bhi 'shrangar vilasini' naam se bharatpur se prakashit hua tha
 Its theme is also Shringar and heroine, and Hindi verses have been composed in Sanskrit language in this book
 yadhyapi isaki rachana shuddh sanskrit main he, phir bhi dev kii vaastavik pratibha ke darshan isamen nahin hote
 To conclude from these majority texts of Dev that all texts are different from each other is misleading
 inke ek granth ke anek chand duusare granthon main milte hai or praaia: inhone apane kisi purvavarti granth ko ashrayadata kaa naam badalakar doosraa naam de diya he
 Most of Deva's narrative themes are love and adornment, but his perception of love and adornment is extremely high and his spirit is expressed in a sublime and bright form
 dev kaa kavyashastreey vivechan bhi, jo inke granthon main lakshan anshon main praapt hota he, apni moulik visheshta rakhata he
 But much of Dev's fame is contained in examples, not in his traits
 dev ke savaiya or ghanaakshari donon hi apni chhap rakhte hai or dev kii sundar rachanaaon ko kisi duusare kavi kii rachanaaon se milakar chipa rakhana sambhav na hoga
 The more extensive experience one gets in the compositions of Dev, the deeper the emotionality is also gained
 kisi bhi bhav kaa dev jaisaa sajiv or marmasparshi varnan asaadhaaran vastu he
 The imagination of God does not only possess an oratory characteristic, but he is fed with the feeling of sensation and gets plucked
 isi prakaar dev kii shabdaawalee bhi apni he
 The musical flowing vocabulary in Dev's vocabulary makes the verses effortlessly memorable and Dev has had unequaled success in portraying form, beauty, object, character
 dev apni inhen visheshtaon ke kaaran hindi sahitya main atyant utkrisht sthaan ke adhikari hue hai, yadhyapi samasamyik rajya sammaan inhen vaisaa praapt nahin hua tha jaisaa inhen milanaa chahie tha

 The courts that were set up by the government to investigate human rights abuses during the Emergency appeared retaliatory against Indira Gandhi, with Indira missing no opportunity to portray herself as a troubled woman

 congress ne loksabhaa main 351 siten jeetin or janata party, yaa bache hue gathbandhan ko 32 siten milin
 The Janata Party continued to divide year after year, but it proved to be an important milestone in the country's political history: it was a coalition and proved that the Congress could be defeated

 Now seeking votes on the basis of caste and religion became the focal point

 Rao's supporters gave him credit for saving the country's economy and energizing the country's foreign policy but his government was uncertain and weak before the elections in April to May
 may 1995 main, varisht netaa arjuna singh or narayan dutt tiwari ne congress chhod di or apni party kaa gathan kiya
 The Harshad Mehta scandal, Vohra's report on criminalization of politics, the Jain hawala case and the 'tandoor murder case' damaged the Rao government's credibility
 bhaajapa va uske sahyogi dal or sanyukt morcha, vam morcha or janata dal kaa gathbandhan, chunaavon main congress ke mukhya pratidwandvi the

 But Gujral was only as a stop-gap arrangement
 desh main 1998 main phir se chunaav hona tay tha
 The life of the 11th Lok Sabha was short, it lasted barely one and a half years
 The minority-led Indra Kumar Gujral government fell on 28 November 1997 when the Congress led by Sitaram Kesri led the DMK leader in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi
 on ke shaamil hone ke vivaad ke chalate sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya
 New elections were announced and the 12th Lok Sabha was formed on 10 March 1998 and a coalition led by senior BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in nine days later
 12 veen loksabhaa keval 413 din chali, jo us tithi tak kaa sabase kam samay tha
 Lack of a viable alternative led to disintegration when the 13-month-old Bharatiya Janata Party-led government was ousted by one vote on 17 April
 aisa paanchavin baar hua tha jab loksabhaa ko apana kaarykaal puraa karne se pehle bhang kar diya gaya
 Elections for all Lok Sabha seats were held prematurely after the dissolution of the Lok Sabha on 4 December 1997
 chunaav pashchaat gathbandhan kii ranneeti ne bhaajapa ke netritv vaale gathbandhan ko 265 siton kaa kaaryakari bahumat pradaan kiya
 In this context, on March 15, President KR Narayanan invited Vajpayee to form the next government

 On 17 April 1999, Vajpayee lost the confidence vote in the Lok Sabha and consequently his coalition government resigned
 unhone iskaa kaaran apane 24 party vaale rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan main saamanjasy kii kami hona bataaya
 The BJP lost by one vote in the vote due to the withdrawal of the AIADMK led by its alliance partner Jayalalithaa

 The BJP alleged that Jayalalithaa was seeking to avoid investigations into allegations of corruption and no agreement could be reached between the parties which led to the government's defeat

 Their rivalry became more evident only in the personal confrontation between Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vajpayee
 sonia gandhi ko 1998 main kaaphi kam umr main party ke adhyaksh pad ke liye nirvaachit kiya gaya, sonia kii janmabhumi italy hone kii baat ko mudda banaakar maharashtra ke congressi netaa sharad pavaar ne sonia ke chayan ko chunauti di
 This led to an internal crisis in the Congress and the BJP effectively used it as an electoral issue
 vaajapeyi dwaara kargil yuddh se nipatane kaa sakaaratmak drushtikon bhi ek mudda tha jo bhaajapa ke paksh main kaam kar rahaa tha
 This war had ended just months before the elections and it strengthened India's position in Kashmir

 Based on the moderate to political expansion of strong and extensive alliances with other parties, the BJP and its allies continued to grow in the 1991, 1996 and 1998 elections; And due to territorial expansion, the NDA became competitive and even got the highest number of votes in Congress-dominated areas like Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Assam
 ye kaarak 1999 ke chunaav parinaamon main nirnaayak sabit hue
 In the result that came on 6 October, the NDA got 298 seats, Congress and its allies got 136 seats
 vaajapeyi ne 13 oktober ko pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath lee
 The bjp-led NDA government completed five years of its rule under the supervision of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2004 and four-phase elections were held between April 20 and May 10, 2004
 adhikansh vishleshkon kaa maananaa tha ki rajg, 'feel good factor' or apane prachaar abhiyaan 'bharat udai' kii madad se, satta virdohi lahar ko haraa degi or spasht bahumat praapt karegi
 The economy had shown steady growth during the BJP rule and disinvestment of public sector undertakings was put on track
 bharat ke videshi mudra bhandar main 100 arab dollar se adhik raashi jamaa thi 
 The service sector also generated many jobs available
 1990 ke dashak ke anya sabhi loksabhaa chunaavon kii tulana main in chunaavon main, do vyaktitvon kaa takaraav adhik dekha gaya kyonki vahaan koi teesraa vyavhaarya vikalp maujuud nahin tha
 The quarrel between the BJP and its allies was on one side and that of the Congress and its allies on the other
 haalanki, kshetreey matbhed rashtriya paridrishy par ubhare the
 The BJP contested as a member of the NDA, though its agreement on seat sharing was also with some strong regional parties outside the NDA such as the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party in Tamil Nadu
 congress ke netritv main rashtriya str kaa vipakshi morcha banane kii koshish bhi hui
 In the end, no agreement was reached, but at the regional level, there was an alliance of Congress and regional parties in several states
 yah pehali baar tha ki congress ne sansadeey chunaavon main is tarah ke gathbandhan ke saath chunaav ladaa tha
 The Left parties, particularly the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India, contested on their own in the strongholds of West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala and faced both the Congress and the NDA
 anya rajyon jaise punjab or andhra pradesh main unhone congress ke saath siten banti
 In Tamil Nadu, he was part of the dmk-led Democratic Progressive Alliance
 bahujan samaaj party or samaajawaadee party ne congress yaa bhaajapa donon main se kisi ke saath bhi jane se inkaar kar diya

 haalanki chunaav purv bhavishyavaaniyon main bhaajapa ke liye baari bahumat kii baat kahi gai thi, lekin agsit paul main trishanku sansad kii bhavishyavaanee hui
 There is also a general perception that as soon as the BJP began to believe that the elections were not entirely in its favor, it shifted the focus of the bjp's campaign from India Shining to issues of stability
 jis congress ko bhaajapa ne "puraane bhang vaali" kaa naam diya tha use mukhyatah garibon, graminon, nichali jatiyon or alpsankhyak matadaataaon kaa baari samarthan mila jisase congress ne badi jeet hasil kii; in logon ko ek vishalkay madhyamvarg ko janm dene vaali vigat varshon kii aarthik vruddhi kaa koi vishesh laabh praapt nahin hua
 Various reasons are attributed to the defeat in pre-election predictions
 rashtriya muddon kii bajaay log apane aasapaas ke muddon, jaise pani kii kami, sookhaa, aadi, ke bare main zyada chintit the; or bhaajapa ke sahyogi satta virdohi bhaawanaaon kaa saamana kar rahe the
 On 13 May, the BJP accepted the defeat and the Congress was able to get a majority of 335 out of 543 under the help of its allies and under the guidance of Sonia Gandhi
 chunaav ke baad hue is gathbandhan ko sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kaha gaya

 The objects that appear in the sky sometimes moving from one side to another or falling on the earth are called 'breaking stars' or 'luka' in meteor and common colloquium
 ulkaon kaa jo ansh vayumandal main jalane se bachakar prithvi tak pahunchataa he use ulkapind kehete hai
 Meteors can be seen in countless numbers each night, but the number of bodies that fall on the earth is very small
 vaigyanik drushti se inkaa mahatv bahut adhik he kyonki ek to ye ati durlabh hote hai, duusare akaash main vichrate hue vibhinn grahon ityadi ke sanghathan or sanrachana ke gyaan ke pratyaksh strot keval ye hi pind hai
 By studying them, we also get a sense of what are the reactions on the matter coming from the sky in the global environment
 is prakaar ye pind brahmandavidya or bhuvigyaan ke bich sampark sthapit karte hai
 Although man was familiar with these falling stars from very ancient times, in the development of modern science, it took a long time for man to believe that these bodies found on the ground came from the sky on earth

 In 1768, Father Basile automatically saw a meteorite coming to Earth at a place called Luce in France
 agle varsh usne paris kii vigyaan kii royal academi ke adhiveshan main is vrittant par ek lekh padhaa
 Not believing the account, the Academy appointed a commission to investigate the incident, reporting that Father Basile's account was misleading, stating that the body of the body had become somewhat glassy due to lightning
 This led to the confusion of Basile that these bodies are not part of the earth
 tadnantar german darshanik cladni ne san 1794 i

 Although this idea was not immediately accepted even this time, Claudney received the credit for drawing attention to this topic and since then scientists began to give more attention to the subject

 main france main laa agil sthaan par ulkapindon kii ek bahut badi vrishti hui jisamen anginat chote-bade pathar gire or unamem se praaia: do-teen hajaar ikatthe bhi kiye ja sake
 The French Academy of Sciences thoroughly researched the rain, and in the end no one suspected that meteorites actually came to Earth from the mantle
 ulkapindon kaa mukhya vargeekaran unke sanghathan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Some bodies are mostly made of iron, nickel or alloys and some resemble stones made of silicate minerals
 pehle vargvaalon ko dhatvik or duusare vargvaalon ko aashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In addition, metallic and surprising substances are often found in the same quantity in some bodies, they are called metallic meteorites
 vastut: purnataya dhatvik or purnataya aashmik ulkpindon ke bich sabhi prakaar kii ant:sth jatiyon ke ulkapind paae jate hai jisase pindon ke varg kaa nirnay karnaa bahudhaa kathin ho jaataa he
 Depending on the structure, strains are made in all three classes
 aashmik pindon main do mukhya upbhed hai jinamein se ek ko kaundrite or duusare ko akundrite kehete hai
 The main feature of the first subclass is that some specific circular grains, called caudreule, are present in them
 jin pindon main kaundrul upasthit nahin rahete unhen akundrite kehete hai
 There are also two main strains in metallic meteorites which are called Ashtaniq and Shasthanik respectively
 ye naam pindon kii antarrachana vyakt karte hai or jaisaa in naamon se vyakt hota he, pehle vibhed ke pindon main dhatvik padaarth ke bandha ashtani aakaar main or duusare main shashthinik aakaar main vinyast hote hai
 This type of composition is called Vidmanstetter and it can be identified with great ease on the leaf page of the body
 dhatvashmik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upvarg hai jinhen krmanusaar pelesite or ardhdhathwik kehete hai
 The surprising part of the first subclass of these bodies is mainly made up of olivine minerals, which are often circular and are incorporated into a system of ferrous-nickel metals
 ardhdhathwik ulkapindon main mukhyat: piroxin or alp maatra main anaurthite felsapaar vidyaman hote hai
 It has been mentioned in the earlier case that meteorites are classified based on the primacy of metallic and astral organs
 kintu in pindon main rasinic tatwon or khanijon ke vitaran ke sambandh main koi sunishchit aadhaar prathit nahin hota
 Apart from the three main classes of meteorites, there are several subclasses, each with its own distinct mineral community
 abhi tak praaia: 25 nae virgon kaa pataa laga he or praaia: prati do varsh ek nae upvarg kaa pataa lagata rahaa he
 The difficulty is that the materials available for study are very small
 abhi tak ulkapindon main keval 52 rasinic tatwon kii upasthiti pramanit hui he jinke naam nimnlikhit hai: 
 oxigen

 Argon Gallium

 Potassium Lithium
 helium Of these 52 elements, only eight are found in abundance, of which Hall is the most prominent
 anya saat main krmanusaar oxijan, silicon, manganisheium, gandhak, aluminium, nikal or calcium hai
 In addition to these, 20 other elements are found in sufficient quantity and their presence was detected before 1926 by simple chemical analysis
 shesh 24 tatv atyant alp maatra main vidyaman hai evam unki upasthiti varnakramadarshaki vishleshan se siddh kii gai he
 From the point of view of mineral composition there are many differences in the characteristics of meteorites and rocks found in the earth
 saadharantaya bhumandaleey shail raashiyon main swatantra dhaatu rup main loha tathaa nikal atyant durlabh hote hai, kintu ulkapindon main dhaatuen shuddh rup main bahut prachurtaa se tathaa praaia: anivaaryat: pai jaati hai
 In addition, there are many minerals that are not found in terrestrial rocks, but are found in meteorites
 inamen se pramukh oldemite or shribersite hai
 Both these minerals are not permanent in abundance of moisture and oxygen and hence are not found in global rocks
 inaki upasthiti se yah bodh hota he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti aise vaataavaran main hui jahaan bhumandal kii apeksha oxidikaran kii paristhitiyaan nune rahi hongi
 Astounding meteorites generally lack the abundance of pyroxene and olivine and lack of feldspar, making their organization similar to the superfamous rocks of the planet
 ulkapindon kii utpatti kaa vishay bahut hi vivaadaaspad he
 Several views have been proposed on this subject from time to time, in some of which they have been considered as part of Earth, Moon, Sun and Comet etc
 ek ati maanya mat ke anusaar inaki utpatti ek aise grah se hui jo ab purnataya vinasht ho gaya he
 In this view, it is imagined that in the beginning, there must have been a planet in the shape of Mars which was destroyed when it came very close to another big planet, or collided with another planet, due to which billions of small number Large blocks formed which are visible in meteorite form
 is mat ke anusaar dhatvik ulka us kalpit grah kaa kendriya bhaag tathaa aashmik ulka upree prishth nirupit karte hai
 Although this metaphor explains many symptoms of meteorites, many things remain an incomprehensible puzzle
 udaahranarth kuch dhatvik ulkapindon main ashtani rachana hoti he jo saadharantaya 800 degree centegrade taap par nasht ho jaati he
 It is believed that during the fission of that fictitious planet, there must have been more heat in it
 phir bhi yah samaj main nahin aata ki yah ashtani rachana vinasht hone se kaise bachi
 Similarly, there is also doubt as to where the iron came from in the Akundrite Awesome Meteor and how Kaunduyul was formed in the Kondrite Awesome Meteor
 ek anya mat main yah prastaavit kiya gaya he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti grahon ke saath saath ho hui, athwa yon kahana chahie ki soramandal evam samast khamandaleey padaartho kii utpatti ulkapindon se hi hui
 According to this fantasy, the primordial world was full of meteorites and in time, those bodies gathered in different masses and according to their maximum density, gasamic noharica, constellations and planets were born
 is kalpana kii ek badi truti yah prathit hoti he ki khamandal main upasthit ulkapind itani dur-dur chhitaraaye hue hai tathaa unka parsparik aakarshan itnaa ksheen he ki unke ekatra hokar badi raashi banane main atyadhik samay lagegaa
 But there is no doubt that once a sufficiently large amount of money is formed, it will be able to retain its power and will eventually increase its size by adding more bodies
 sambhav he, uparyukt vidhiyon main anshat: sanshodhan karne se inaki utpatti kii vaastavik vidhi nirdhaarit ho sake
 a large collection of meteorites is on display in the Geological Department of the Indian Museum of Calcutta
 isaki dekharekh bhartiya bhuvaigyanik surveykshan sanstha ke nirikshan main hoti he
 According to the prevailing rules, meteorites dropped anywhere in the country are government property
 jis kisi ko aisa pind mili uskaa kartavya he ki vah use sthaneey jiladhish ke paas pahunchaa de jahaan se vah bhartiya bhuvaigyanik surveykshan vibhaag ko bhej diya jaataa he
 Thus gradually this collection has become unique in its way
 iske atirikt is sangrah main videshon se bhi praapt namoonay rakhe gaye hai
 This collection is the largest in Asia and its position is very high in other collections of the world, because one has many different specimens in it and the other many specimens are of very rare species
 sab milakar isamen 468 vibhinn ulkapaat nirupit hai, jinamein se 149 dhatvik or 319 aashmik varg ke hai
 The largest Indian wondrous meteorite of this museum was obtained from Medua place in Allahabad district
 vah 30 agast 1920 ko praat: 11 bajkar 15 minute par giri tha
 Its weight is usually 56,657 grams and the longest length is 12 inches
 doosraa sthaan us pind kaa he jo malabar main kuttipuram gram main 6 april 1914 ko praat: kaal 7 baje gira tha
 Its weight is 38,437 grams

 Conservatism is an ideology practiced within the social sciences that emulates traditional beliefs on the basis of faith and experience rather than rationality or scientism
 yah saamaajik, raajnneetik or naitik manyataon kaa samucchy he jo chirkaal se prachlit manyataon or vyavastha ke prati sammaan ko badhaava detii he
 This ideology supports the retention of old and tried ideas and institutions, rather than adopting new and untried ideas and institutions

 This temple was destroyed by a landslide in 1880

 The Shakti form of Sati is worshiped here

 About Naini Lake, it is believed that when Shiva was going to Mount Kailash with the dead body of Sati, Shaktipeeths were established wherever his body parts fell

 Inspired by this, this temple has been established

 Every year the fair of Maa Naina Devi is held in Nainital
 puranic katha ke anusaar daksh prajapati kii putree uma kaa vivaah shiv se hua tha
 Daksha Prajapati did not like Shiva, but he could not defer the requests of the gods, so he did not want his daughter to marry Shiva
 ek baar daksh prajapati ne sabhi devataaon ko apane yahan yajna main bulaayaa, parantu apane damaad shiv or beti uma ko nimantran tak nahin diya
 Uma stubbornly reached this yagna
 jab usne haridwar sthit canarvan main apane pita ke yajna main sabhi devataaon kaa sammaan or apana or apane pati kaa niraadar hote hue dekha to vah atyant du:khee ho gayi
 In the Havan Kund of the yagna, she jumped and said, "I will make Shiva my husband in the next life too
" aapane meraa or mere pati kaa jo niraadar kiya iske pratifal - swarup yajna ke havan - kund main syvan jalakar aapke yajna ko asafal karti hoon
 'when Shiva came to know that Uma became Sati, his anger was no longer in the cross
 unhone apane ganon ke dwaara daksh prajapati ke yajna ko nasht-bhrasht kar daalaa
 All the Gods and Gods, seeing this insurmountable form of Shiva, started thinking that Shiva should not be destroyed
 isliye devi-devataaon ne mahadev shiv se prarthana kii or unke krodh ke shant kiya
 Daksha Prajapati also apologized
 shiv ne unako bhi aashirwad diya
 However, upon seeing Sati's burnt body, his quietness swelled
 unhone sati ke jaale hue sharir ko kandhe par daalkar akaash - bhraman karnaa shuru kar diya
 In such a situation, wherever the parts of the body fell, there were power backs
 jahaan par sati ke nayan gire the, vahiin par nainadevi ke rup main uma arthath nanda devi kaa bhavy sthaan ho gaya
 Today's Nainital is the place where the Nain of that goddess fell

 Since then, Shivpathi Nanda is worshiped here as Naina Devi
 yah bhi ek vishisht udhaaharan he ki samast gadhwal-kumaun kii ekmaatr isht devi 'nanda' hi he

 But there is no point in this story, because Nanda has been accepted as the presiding deity in all the mountainous regions
