 The Act was originally passed in August 1935 and was called the longest Act of Parliament enacted at that time
 isaki lambaai kii vajah se, pratikriya swaroop bharat sarkaar dwaara adhinium 1935 ko ko do alag-alag adhiniyamon main vibhajit kiya gaya: In literature on Indian political and constitutional history, the reference is generally taken to be a shortened form of the Government of India 1935 Act, rather than being enacted originally as a text of the Act
 adhinium ke sabase mahatvapurn pahalu the: However, the degree of autonomy the introduction of the provincial level was subject to significant limitations: the provincial governor retained significant reserve powers and the British authorities also retained the authority to suspend a responsible government
 adhinium ke kuch hisson kii maang bharat sangh ko sthapit karnaa tha lekin rajasi rajyon ke shaskaon ke virodh ke kaaran kabhi sanchaalan main nahin aayaa
 The remaining part of the Act came into force in 1937 when the first elections were held under the Act
 unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh ke baad se bhartiya logon ne apane desh kii sarkaar main lagaataar badi bhoomika kii maang kii
 The contribution of Indians to the British war effort during World War i meant that the more conservative elements of the British political establishment felt the need for constitutional change and the resulting 1919 Act of the Government of India
 The act introduced a neo system of government known as the provincial "dyarchy", that is, the government of some regions was placed in the hands of ministers responsible for the provincial legislature while others were appointed by the British-appointed provincial governor
 Were held in the hands of the officials responsible for
 jabaki adhinium, bharatiyon dwaara sarkaar main ek badi bhoomika nibhaane kii maang kaa ek pratibimb tha, saath hi bharat kii vyavastha main us bhoomika kaa kya matlab ho saktaa he iske bare main british bhay kaa ek pratibimb tha
 Experiments with dyarchy proved unsatisfactory
 bhartiya netaaon ke liye ek vishesh rup se niraashaa yah hi ki un kshetron main jahaan keval nammaatr kaa niyantran unhone praapt kiya tha, lekin "mukhya adhikaar" british naukarshahi ke haathon main hi tha
 It was intended to review India's constitutional arrangements and those princely states that were ready to accept it
 haalanki, samjhaute ko rokane ke liye congress or muslim pratinidhiyon ke bich vibhaajan karnaa mukhya kaarak sabit hua chunki vyavastha main sangh ke kaam karne kii mahatvapurn jaankaree thi
 Against the system, the new Conservative-dominated national government in London decided to come forward with the drafting of its own proposal
 lord linlithgo kii adhyakshata main ek sanyukt sansadeey chayan samiti ne kaaphi had tak white paper kii samiksha kii
 On the basis of this white paper, the Government of India bill was created
 cameti str or baad main kattarta ko shant kiya gaya, "suraksha" ko majboot kiya gaya or kendriya vidhansabha ke liye apratyaksh chunaav kaa punah aayojan kiya gaya
 The bill was duly passed into law in August 1935
 is prakriya kaa ek parinaam yah he ki, haalanki bhartiya maangon ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke 1935 kii adhinium ko thodaa or aage janaa chahie tha, iskaa masauda saamagree main bill kaa bistaar or bhartiya bhagidaari kii kami donon kaa arth tha ki bharat main sarvshereshth nirutsaah pratikriya ke saath adhinium kaa hona jabaki britain main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke liye yah kattarpanthi sabit hui
 Although it became unusual for the Acts of the British Parliament to include the Preamble, the lack of one from the Government of India Act 1935 contrasted with the Act of 1919, which led to the purpose of that Act relating to it for Indian political development
 Established a comprehensive philosophy
 20 agast 1917 ko house of comons ke liye bharat mantri edwin montagu ke vaktavy par aadhaarit 1919 ke adhinium kii prastaavna uddhrut he, jo vaada karti he: 


 is a gradual development of self-governing institution with a philosophy for the progressive presentation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire
 canada or australia jaise maujuuda dominian ke saath bhartiya maangon main ab british bharat main sanvaidhanik samta ko praapt karnaa tha jiskaa arth tha ki british rashtramandal main sampoorn swaittata
 An important element in the British political circle doubted that Indians were able to run their country on this basis and with sufficient "security", perhaps, the Dominion status as an objective after a long period of gradual constitutional development saw
 unke bich yah tanaav or bhartiya or british ke bheetar drushti ke parinamswaroop 1935 adhinium ke besanga samjhaute ko paaya gaya jisamen isaki koi apni prastaavna nahin thi, lekin 1919 adhinium kii prastaavna ko isaki jagah rakhaa gaya phir bhi us adhinium ke avshesh ko nirast kiya
 It was generally seen in India as more mixed messages from the British, suggesting a defiant attitude on its part and the barest of "minimum essentials" towards satisfying Indian desires
 sabase aadhunik samvidhanon ke vipareet, lekin us samay ke rashtramandal sanvaidhanik kanoon ke saath saamaanya, adhinium ne "adhikaar ke bill" ko nae pranali ke bheetar shaamil nahin kiya jisaki sthapana kaa uddeshy tha
 However, in the proposed case of the Union of India there were some complications involving a set of rights, as the new entity included nominal sovereign princely states
 haalanki kuch logon dwaara ek alag drushtikon ko mana gaya or nehru report main masauda ruparekha samvidhan main bill ke adhikaar ko shaamil kiya gaya
 In 1947, a relatively few amendments to the Act made the Interim Implementation Constitution of India and Pakistan
 adhinium keval atyant vistrut hi nahin tha, lekin yah 'suraksha maanak' ke saath ghira tha, british jimmedaariyon or hiton ko banaae rakhane ke liye jab bhi isaki aavashyaktaa hoti hastkshep karne ke liye british sarkaar ko sakasham banane ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 To meet this goal, the Indian government's institutions are gradually increasing in the face of Indianisation, the decision to use the Act and the actual administration of the security measures in the hands of the British appointed Viceroy and the Provincial Governors who are the Secretary of State for India Was under control
 'vishaal shaktiyon or jimmedaariyon jise governor general apane vivek yaa apane vyaktigat nirnay ke anusaar anushaasan karnaa chahie, yah spasht he ki uske ko superman kii tarah ho jane kii ummid hoti he
 He must be endowed with an infinite capacity for humility, courage and hard work

 " yah bhaashan drudh torij ke drushtakon ko pratibimbit karti he jo ek din lebar government dwaara viceroy kii niyukti hone kii sambhaavna dwaara bhaybheet tha
 a proper reading of the Act shows that the British Government has prepared it for itself, whenever they feel they could take full control of it at any time with the legal tools

 But there is a lack of reality, as the case lacks the necessary powers in defense and foreign affairs, the Governor General is necessarily given a threshold for ministerial activity and the measure of representation of Indian states is negative and even That there is no possibility of the introduction of democratic control

 " lord lothian ne ek pantalis minute ke lambi baatcheet main is bill ke bare main apane vichaar rakhe hai: "I agree with the surrendered Kattaro
 Those who are not used to any constitution cannot realize what great powers they have to use
 yadi aap is samvidhan ko dekhenge to aisa lagegaa ki sabhi shaktiyaan governor general or rajyapal main nihit he
 But here the whole power is not vested in the king? Everything is done in the name of the king, but does the king ever interfere in it? Once power falls into the hands of the legislature, the governor or the governor general never intervene

 The impropriety of this arrangement is evident when the status of British capital in an Indian modern region is given greater prominence and total dominance, the impropriety is maintained through the commercial system, the UK in both India's international and coastal shipping traffic Removal of shipping interests and Indian capital in the UK without value and Indians in shipping within the UK Sector is the non-existence

 Thus the involuntary conditional concessions of power in the Acts of 1919 and 1935 caused more dissatisfaction and failed to win the rule of influential groups in India which were desperately needed

 However, intervention by the British governor intensified the paternal threat was done

 The source of the tendencies of Eurocentricity as an idea can be seen in the Renaissance period
 rinesaan main pracheen yunaan or rome kii kala or darshan ko hi gyaan ke mukhya strot ke rup main manyata di gayi thi
 In later periods, this idea of europe's superiority was formulated in various ways
 dhire-dhire upniveshvaadi agrahon ke tahat europe or europee saanskrithik purvadharanaon ko swaabhaavik, naiysargik or saarvbhaum maan kar unheen ke aadhaar par baaki duniya kii vyakhya or vishleshan karne ke ravaiye ke rup main 'europe- centric' drushtikon ubhara
 After World War II in the twentieth century, critics of capitalism and imperialism began to see Eurocentricity as an ideology
the term was not found in the Oxford Dictionary sattar ke dashak se pehle oxuard dictionari main yah shabd nahin miltaa tha
 But the Marxist writings of Sameer Amin in the eighties transformed it into a frequently used concept in the intellectual world
 vidmbana yah he ki marxvaadi vidwaanon dwaara gadha gaya yah pad marks ke lekhan kii aalochana karne ke liye bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 There is no dearth of those who claim Marx as Eurocentric

 Since 1851, the placing of Greenwich, London at the center of the longitude meridian of maps of the world, is a fact of Eurocentricity that has been shaken by the whole world without any cultural objection

 According to Saeed, since enlightenment, European culture has developed a systemic discipline through which it forms and manages to manage the former world
 eurokendriyata sahitya-adhyayan, itihaas-lekhan or maanavshaastra ke anushaasan ke madhyam se bhi pusht hui he
 In the field of literature, its advocates cleverly undertook the project of establishing their conceptions as universal of literature
 itihaas main vijetaon ke drushtikon se lekhan kiya gaya
 Eurocentricity infiltrated the anthropological world as an autocratic insistence and called non-european cultures 'primitive' against European civilizational standards
 kuch samskruti-samikshakon kii to manyata he ki agar eurokendriya vichaar pehle se sthapit na hota to maanavshaastra ke shuruaati roopon kaa upniveshwaad ke saath itnaa ghanishtha rishta sthapit hi na ho paata
 There is also a tendency to confirm Eurocentricity in the educational activities undertaken by missionaries for the promotion of Christianity
 inhen sab kaarnon se gair-europee samaajon ne aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya main eurokendriyata ko itnaa jazb kar liya he ki pashchim se aane vaali har chiz yaa kriti ko shreshth maanane kaa vichaar vigyaan, udyog, ganit, kala, manoranjan or samskruti jaise sabhi mahatvapurn kshetron par lagbhag sthai rup se haaavee ho chukaa he
 Even people who are alert to Eurocentricity are eventually found to be in harmony with it
 aitihaasik drushti se dekhen to europee shreshthata kaa vichaar pandrahavin sadi main europee samrajyavad ke saath-saath sudrudh hua
 The scientific revolution, the commercial revolution and the expansion of colonial empires expressed themselves as the rise of the modern era
 ise 'european chamatkaar' kaa daur mana jaataa he jisase pehle europe aarthik or praudyogic drushti se turki kii automan kilaafat, bharat ke mogul samrajya or china ke ming samrajya ke mukaable nahin thahar saktaa tha
 The concept reached its zenith with the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the second wave of European colonization
 europee takatein duniya main vyapaar or raajnneeti par chaa gayin
 Those who had developed rapidly on the basis of progressivism and industrialism, those who considered European civilization as the universal center of the world, gave contemptuous discussions to the societies based on hunting, farming and animal husbandry
 attharahavin sadi main hi europee lekhakon ko europe or duniya ke duusare mahadwipon kii tulana main yah kehete hue paaya ja saktaa tha ki europe bhugolic kshetrafal main dusron se chota zarur he, par vibhinn kaarnon se uski sthiti khaas tarah kii he
 This particular situation was then defined by arguing for his mastery in European customs, courtesy, science and art
 eurokendriyata ke bare main ek sawaal yah bhi uthaaya jaataa he ki kya yah pravriti duniya ke anya bhaagon main paye jane vaale swajatvaad kii hi ek kism nahin he? chiniyon or japaniyon main bhi saanskrithik shreshthata kaa dambh he
 The contests of the 'american Century' are also a model of autism
 lekin eurokendriyata ko jaise hi upniveshwaad ke pariprekshya main rakh kar dekha jaataa he, vaise hi yah vichaar saamaanya swajatvaad se alag ek vishisht sanrachana kii tarah dikhaai dene lagata he
 Decay in the credibility of Eurocentricism also began with the vigor of anti-colonial movements and the epoch-making process of de-colonization that followed the Second World War
 azaadi ke andolanon dwaara kiye sthaneey paramparaon or mulyon ke rashtravaadi daavon ne pashchimi saanskrithik aham ko chunauti di
 New history was created in the central and southern parts of India and the American continent with the same purpose and new cultural identities were created
 eurokendriyata ke barakes vishwa-sabhyataa kii bahukendriya tasveeron main rang bhare gayi
 The worldwide prestige of the ideas of Eastern personalities like Ravindra Nath Thakur and the civilized criticism of Gandhi-provided West also played a significant role in pushing Eurocentricity off the stage

 Short message service or simple mobile messaging is a communication protocol, which allows the exchange of short text messages between mobile telephone devices

 Triple technology has made the development and growth of text messaging easier

 The origin of the treble used on modern handsets \ ] 03

 tabase is seva ke liye sahyog ko vaikalpik mobile jaise eenesai sidime nekatwork or digital eempies ke saath-saath upgrah or landline network ko bhi shaamil kar diya gaya he
 Most triple messages are text messages from one mobile to another, using other standard support varieties of message transmission
 mobail upyogkartaaon kii sevaaon main paath sandesh ko jodne kaa vichaar 1980 ke dashak ke prarambh main mobile sanchaar sevaaon ke bahut se samudaayon main prachlit tha
 Experts from many communities in these communities contributed to the discussions on which GSM services should be
 kisi ek mobile upyogkarta ko alert karne ke saadhan ke rup main tihara sa ke adhikansh vichaar udhaaharan ke taur par pehle se surakshit whise mail par aadhaarit the jabaki dusron main telemetry jese apekshaakrit adhik jatil anuprayogon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa tha
 But some believe that Triple s should be used to send messages from m mobile user to another mobile user
 je kii adhyakshata me farvari 1985 ke aarambh main jiesem upasamooh dablupi 3, par pehle hi charchaa hone ke baad iskaa upyog hone laga tha
 Odsted states that the triple GS was considered in the major GSM group as a potential service for the new digital cellular system

 Discussions on GSM services were incorporated into the recommendations of GSM 02; 03 Teleservices, supported by GSM PLMN

 However, its growth was slow initially with only 1995 subscribers being able to send 0; 4 messages a month on average as per subscriber to GSM

 With the passage of time, billing on the SMSC was replaced with Switch Billing which had some new features inside the SMSC which prevented foreign mobile users from being allowed to send messages through it
 varsh 2000 ke ant tak prati yuzar prati maas tak sandeshon kii ausat sankhya 35 ho gai or christmas diwas 2006 tak 205 million lekh keval akele euke main bhi bheje gaye the
 It has also been said that in the initial days, roaming customers were rarely billed for their treble after holidays abroad, which received tremendous promotions to text messages as an alternative to voice calls
 tihara sa ko mul rup se jiesem ke ang ke rup main dizin kiya gaya tha kintu ab 3 ji network sahit network kii vibhinn shreniyon par uplabdh he
 However, not all text messaging systems use Triple S, and some notable alternative implementations of this concept include j-phone's Skymal and NTT Dokoma's Short Mail, both of which are in Japan
 antiti docomo kii ai-mod or aarm kii blekaberi dwaara lokapriyata vaali phone par i-mail sandesh seva bhi tisipi / ypi aapurtikarta ke taur par vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The aggregator model is based on multiple agreements with mobile carriers in which a 2-way triple track is exchanged in and out of the operator's triple platform
 ise sthaneey sthgan model bhi kehete hai
 Aggregators lack direct access to the SS7 protocol, which is a protocol where triple messages are exchanged
 in aapurtikartaaon kaa sandesh delivery par na to koi niyantran hota he or na hi drishyata jisase delivery guarantee dene main ayogy ho jate hai
 SMS messages are delivered to the operator's SMS-C and not to the customer's handset
 esemes dwaar aapurtikartaaon kii ek anya kism tihara sa sandeshon kaa maarg prashast karne ke liye eses7 connectivity par aadhaarit he jise antarrashtriya sthagan model
bhi kaha jaataa he
 The advantage of this model is the ability to send data directly via SS7 which provides full control and visibility over the entire route while sending triple to the service provider
 iskaa arth yah hua ki tihara sa sandeshon ko logon ke bich sidhe bheja ja saktaa he jiske liye duusare mobile opretaron ke tihara sa kedron kaa sahaara nahin lenaa padataa he
 Therefore, delay and loss of messages cannot be avoided to provide a guarantee of complete delivery of messages and ideal routing, making this route route model especially efficient when using mission critical messaging and Used in corporate communication 1

 maanak hindi hindi kaa maanak swaroop he jiskaa shiksha, karyalayn kaaryon aadi main prayog kiya jaataa he
 The area of language is wide in terms of country, time and character
 isaliye sabhi bhashaaon ke vividh rup milte hai
 Unity is tried in these diverse forms and is called the standard language
 hindi main ‘maanak bhashaa’ ke arth main pehle ‘sadhu bhashaa’, ‘taksaali bhashaa’, ‘shuddh bhashaa’, ‘adarsh bhashaa’ tathaa ‘parinishthit bhashaa’ aadi kaa prayog hota tha
 After the stabilization of the word 'value' as a percentage of the English word 'standard', the word 'standard language' came into being as a translation of 'standard language'
 angrezi ke ‘standard’ shabd kii vyutpatti vivaadaaspad he
 Some people associate it with 'stand' and some people 'extend'
 mere vichaar main yah ‘stand’ se sambhddha he
 The one who is hardened, clearly sets a different pattern from others
 ‘maanak bhashaa’ bhi amanak bhashaa-roopon se alag ek pratimaan kaa kaam karti he
 Based on the same, the normality of the language used by someone is judged inhuman
 ‘maanak bhashaa’ ko logon ne tarah-tarah se spasht karne kaa ytn kiya he
 According to Robbins, the dialect of socially important people is called the standard language
 stiwart ne prakruti, aantarik vyavastha tathaa saamaajik prayog aadi ke aadhaar par bhashaa ke vibhinn prakaaron main antar dikhaane ke liye chaar aadhaar maane hai
 'historicity' means the ancient tradition of language and its development in terms of time
 adhikansh bhashaayen ek peedi se duusari peedi tak phir duusari se teesri tak or aise hi aage peedi-dar-peedi chalati rahati hai
 This is their historicity
 yah ullekh he ki aspiranto, ido, launglan jaisi kritim bhashaaon main is aitihaasikta kaa abhaav hota he
 That is to give language a standard form
 aisa rup jisamen praapt sabhi vikalpon main ek ko maanak maan liya gaya ho tathaa jis bhashaa rup ko us bhashaa ke saare bolne vaale maanak sweekaar karte hon
 It is to be noted that most of the advanced languages of the whole world have a standard form, while the dialect, dialect, Creole etc
 do not have a standard form
 maanakeekaran ke kaaran hi koi bhashaa apane puure kshetra main shabdaawalee tathaa vyakaran kii drushti se samarup hoti he, isiilie vah sabhi logon ke liye bodhgamy bhi hoti he
 Also, it is recognized by all people, so it is also more prestigious than other language forms
 arthath bhashaa kaa prayokta koi samaaj ho jisamen bolchaal tathaa lekhan aadi main us bhashaa kaa prayog hota ho
 There is continuous development in the vibrant language
 vishwa main boli jane vaali sabhi bhashaaon or boliyon main jeevantta milti he
 Yes, old or classic languages like Sanskrit, Latin, Pali, Prakrit, Apabhramsa are not in common use today, hence they cannot be considered liveness
 swaittata se aashya he apane astitv ke liye kisi bhashaa kaa kisi anya bhashaa par nirbhar na hona
 Generally, languages are autonomous, but dialects are not autonomous; They depend on language for their existence
 isiilie hamen prayek boli ke liye yah kahana padataa he ki vah boli amuk bhashaa kii he kintu bhashaa ke sambandh main aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he
 If we consider these grounds, the classic language has historicity, normality, but no vibrancy, dialect does not have normality and autonomy, language does not have normality, language is only normative in language, only historicality in pidgin
 Is, Creole has all the others, but not normality
 maanak bhashaa main ye chaaro hi visheshtaayen hoti hai
 In fact, these things in Stewart say that the standard language has the above four characteristics, but 'standard language also has normality', unless we tell what standardism is
 maanakta main nimnaankit baaten aati hai— 'standard language' refers to the form of a language which is considered pure in the whole area of that language and which the educated and polite society of that region considers the ideal form of its language and often in all formal situations, in writing, administration And tries to use the same as a medium of education
 bhashaaon ko maanak rup dene kii bhaavana jin anek kaarnon se vishwa main jaagi, unamem saamaajik awashyaktaa, press kaa prachaar, vaigyanik drushtikon ke vikaas se ekarupata ke prati rujhaan tathaa swa kii asmita aadi mukhya hai
 Here we have to look at one or two of them in some detail otherwise
 udhaaharan ke liye maanak bhashaa kii saamaajik aavashyaktaa se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Take any field, administration of literature in all dialects, giving education or dialogue among themselves is difficult, even impractical
 hindi kii hi baat len to uski bees-pachchis boliyon main aisa karnaa bahut sambhav nahin he
 Today, Kumauni speaks Hindi with a Maithili speaking language, but if there was no standard Hindi, they would not understand each other
 sabhi boliyon main anya boliyon ke sahitya kaa anuwaad bhi sadhano kii kami se bahut sambhanv nahin he, aisi sthiti main shailesh matiani ke sahitya kaa anand maithili bhashi nahin le saktaa tha, na nagarjun ke sahitya kaa anand kumaunni, gadhwali yaa hariyani bhashi
 In this way, the imposition of a standard language over all dialects, therefore, whatever is good or bad, has a social imperative and so some standard languages have developed themselves in different areas, some have been and they have extended those areas quite far- Provided endless facilities as a far-reaching medium
 aise hi press ke avishkaar tathaa prachaar ne bhi maanakta ko anivaary banaaya he

 The economically exploitable and viable water potential in India is estimated at 84,000 MW at a 66 percent weight factor
 iske atirikt, chote, laghu tathaa sookshm jal vidyut yojanaon se sthapit kshamta ke 6780 megawatt kaa aankalan kiya gaya he
 56 sites have also been identified for pumped storage schemes with accumulated installed capacity of 94,000 MW
 tathaapi, abhi tak is sambhavyata ke keval 19
9 pratshit kaa hi dohan kiya ja sakaa he
 Electricity is the hydroelectric power obtained from water generated by water
 vidyut shakti ke janan kii vidhiyon main jalavidyut bahut mahatvapurn hai
 One-third of the entire electric power of the world is received in the form of hydroelectricity
 yon to kisi bhi rup main uplabdh urja ko vidyutshakti ke janan ke liye prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 The energy contained in the water falling in the waterfall has been used since ancient times to run the watermill, but the use of this energy for electric power has been given from the twentieth century itself
 na keval girte hue jal main nihit urja kaa upyog shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, varan behate hue pani main nihit gatij urja kaa upyog bhi shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, the first is to choose a place where the dam can be stored in plenty of water and the power contained therein can be used to generate electricity for power generation by using canals or open canals in power stations
 upyukt sthaan kii talash ke liye varsha tathaa jameen donon kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he
 The dam is built in such a place where the dam made in the lowest price can store maximum water
 iske liye sthaan kii prakritik dasha aisi honi chahie ki koi nadi ghati main hoti hui pahaado ke bich sankare maarg se guzarati ho, jisase sakare sthaan par band banaakar nadi ke upree bhaag ko ek bade jalashay main parivartit kiya ja sake
 Another agar is built above the dam, from where the water is carried by open canals or taps to the power house
 yah pani bijlighar main sthit bade bade tarabinon ko chalaata he, jinase yojit janitron main vidyut shakti kaa janan hota he
 The turbine is located on the face of the draft tube made of cement concrete
 pani guide wain main hota hua tarabine ke bladon ko ghumata he or is prakaar apane nihit urja kaa tarabine ke chalaane main upyog karata he
 The mechanical energy of the moving turbine is converted into electrical energy and thus the energy contained in water takes the form of hydroelectricity
 tarabine main is prakaar pani main nihit shakti kaa upyog ho jane ke pashchaat, pani draft-tub main se hota hua visarjani kulya main jaataa he, jahaan se vah phir nadi main ja miltaa he
 The design of the draft-tube is such that the remaining energy of the water is slowly depleted, so that it does not damage the river banks when it comes out
 pani main nihit urja, uske aaytan tathaa sheersh par nirbhar karti he
 Hydropower schemes can be divided into three parts according to the head: 1
 ucch sheersh yojana - lagbhag 200 meter se adhik
 2
 Medium Head Plan - 50 meters to 200 meters
 3
 nimna sheersh yojana - 50 meter se kam
 Both the size and the shape of the plan depends on the top and also the type of its turbines accordingly
 is prakaar ucch sheersh ke liye francis tarabine evam paston chakra upyukt hote hai
 Pressurized turbines are used for the middle head
 nimna sheersh ke liye nodak praroop kaa tarabine adhik upyukt hota he
 In high-end schemes, generally, the volume of water is not high
 isliye pani ko nalon dwaara le jaakar tarabine ke tund se ranor kii waltiyon par choda jaataa he, jisase pani main nihit urja ranor ko chalaane main samarth hoti he
 The turbine can control the output of the turbine by controlling the flow and speed of the water and by varying the angle of water released on the buckets and thus control the power generated
 baltiyon ke kone kaa vicharan karnaa bhi sambhav he or donon niyantranon ko swat: chaalit rup se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The propellant turbine runner has only three or four wings
 ye baari ispaat ke bane hote hai
 Low head plans often have a very high water volume
 at: inamen pani ko nalon main le janaa sambhav nahin hota or khuli naalee kaa upyog karnaa hota he
 To obtain the output corresponding to the load, it is necessary to vary the amount of water going into the turbine, which is edited by opening the door
 ye dwaar guide pichhafalak kii bhanti hote hai or inaki sthiti pani kaa niyantran karti he
 Being heavy, these gates are driven by hydraulic pressure
 jis prakaar peltan chakra ke guide pichhafalak, athwa baltiyon, ke kone kaa vicharan kiya jaataa he, usee prakaar inhen bhi swat: chaalit rup se pravartit kiya ja saktaa he
 The automatic driven variance is performed by the servo motor
 yah chota sa motor hota he, jo dravchaalit daabak kaa vicharan karata he
 Its investment is only a fraction of the output of the turbine, so it varies accordingly
 is prakaar is motor dwaara kiya gaya kaary tarabine ke nirgat par, jo uske upar bhaar ke anuroop hota he, nirbhar karata he or swat: chaalit rup se dravchaalit daabak ko gata badhaakar usee ke anusaar guide pichhafalak, athwa dwaara khulaai, kaa niyantran kar detaa he, athwa baltiyon ke kone kaa vyavasthaapan kar detaa he
 Propellant type turbine is the main one in propellant type turbine
 isaki visheshta isaki majboot or ucch dakshata he
 Another feature of this is that the load variance has very little effect on efficiency, due to which this turbine is very suitable for variable loads
 madhyam sheersh yojanaon main, saamanyat:, mishrit pravaahavala tarabine adhik prayukt hota he, parantu sheersh ke anuroop hi uskaa chayan adhik nirbhar karata he
 Steady guide lanes are used to move water to the turbine
 iske nirgat kaa vicharan unke kone ke vicharan se kiya jaataa he
 a low-heading turbine is usually located above the open shafts
 ye sarpil praroop ke aavaran se ghire hote hai, jisase pani ko ek samaan rup se guide pichhafalak dwaara le jaaya ja sake
 In high-powered turbines, this cover is made of metal
 tarabine kshaitij evam urdhwadhar donon prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 But in general, vertical is more used
 inamen bering vishisht prakaar kaa hota he, jise mashin par pratishthit parshv aghat bhi vahan karnaa hota he
 Hence these are called shock wearings
 vering tathaa duusare gatiman bhaagon kaa snehan bhi apane-aap main ek kathin samasya hoti he
 Pressure lubrication method is used for this
 isamen snehak tel ko dabaakar snehan kiye janevaale sthanon main bheja jaataa he
 Pressure is generated by the oil pump
 daab ghat jane par, mashin ke apane aap band ho jane kii vyavastha bhi hoti he, jisase aisi paristhiti main use kshati na pahunche
 There is an oil filter to clean the lubricating oil and there is also an oil cooler to cool the oil that gets heated after lubrication
 jalavidyut yojanaon main sabase adhik mahatv unki sthiti kaa he
 Their condition depends mainly on natural and physical causes
 mote taur par kisi jalavidyut yojana se 1,000 ghan foot prati second ke pravaah se 150 foot kaa sheersh uplabdh hone par lagbhag 10 megawatt kii shakti uplabdh hogi
 The reservoir can also be estimated on the basis that 1 foot of water over an area of 1
13 square miles generates a flow of only 1 cubic foot per second
 at: 1,000 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah paane ke liye jalashay main 113 varg mile ke kshetrafal main ausat se 10 foot gaharaa pani hona chahie
 For any hydroelectric scheme to be practical, it is necessary to have maximum head and flow
 kam sheershawali yojanaayen tabhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati hai, jab pani kaa pravaah paryaapt ho
 High-top schemes can be practical even at low flows
 bijlighar kii sthiti band ke nikat hona anivaary nahin he
 The reservoir can be on the mountain and the powerhouse can be built at the foot of the mountain to get to the top
 aisi dasha main pani kii badi badi nalikaaon dwaara bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Plans with higher heads are usually of this type
 bahut se sthanon par pahari ko katkar surang ke dwaara pani ko pahari ke duusari or bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 It is not compulsory for the power house to be on earth
 bahut se bijlighar prithvi ke andar bhi hote hai or us tak lift dwaara hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 a similar underground power plant has been built in Maithon
 aise bijli ghar swachaalit praroop ke haate hai or duurastha niyantran dwaara prithvital se chaalit hote hai
 Although these power plants are built mainly inside the earth due to natural reasons, they are very important from a strategic point of view
 kam sheershawali yojanaayen hamaare desh main bahut hai
 Many power stations have been built over the Ganges and Sharda canals, in which only the top of 20 to 30 feet is used
 ye yojanaayen pani kaa pravaah adhik hone ke kaaran vyaavhaarik ho saki hai
 Hydropower schemes are mainly in Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and USA
 bharat bhi jalavidyut yojanaon main bahut peeche nahin he or yahan kii kuch yojanaayen vishwa kii mahanatam yojanaon main gini jaati hai, jaise, bhakhra-nangal, damodar ghati, rihand, hyrakund, nagarjun sagar, koyna, shivasamudram, periyar aadi
 Many hydroelectric schemes are also multipurpose
 mukhyat: inke saath sinchai evam baadh rodhak yojanaayen bhi shaamil rahati hai, jisase kshetra kaa sarvangin vikaas kiya ja sake
 Damodar Valley Corporation was also established in India on the basis of Tennessee Valley Corporation in USA
 pichley bees varshon main bahut si mahatvapurn jalavidyut yojanaayen bani hai or sabhi jagah jalavidyut sambhaavnaaon kaa adhyayan kar yojanaayen banaai ja rahi hai
 In hydroelectric planning, although there is a lot of expenditure initially, most of the schemes are successful from the economic point of view due to lower operating expenses
 inke sanyatra kaa jivan bhi apekshaakrit bahut adhik hota he
 Their main drawback is actually their distance from consumer locations
 ye yojanaayen jahaan chahen vahaan ke liye nahin banaai ja saktin
 For example, if the demand for power is in Calcutta, it is not possible to implement the hydroelectric scheme there
 himalay se nikalanevaali nadiyon main apaar jalashakti nihit he, parantu vahaan shakti kii maang nahin he
 In this way, the power generated by the hydroelectric scheme often has to be transmitted to great distances
 at:, jalavidyut yojana kaa saapeksh rup se adhyayan karne ke liye preshnatantr kaa vyay bhi lagaana aavashyak he
 Even then, hydroelectricity is mostly cheap
 geneva sammelnon main chaar sandhiyaan or teen atirikt protocol shaamil hai jo yuddh ke maanviya upachaar ke liye antarrashtriya kanoon ke maanakon ko sthapit karte hai
 The singular term refers to the 1949 agreements negotiated after the Geneva Conference, World War II, to which the terms of the first three treaties were updated and the fourth treaty added
 chauthe geneva sammelan ke anuchhedon main bade paimaane par kaidiyon ke yudhkalin buniyadi adhikaron ko paribhaashit kiya gaya; yuddh kshetra main or aasapaas ke kshetra main nagarikon or ghayalon ke liye suraksha sthapit kiye jane kii vyavastha di
 The Treaties of 1949 were ratified by 194 countries wholly or with exceptions

 The veneration of animals or the practice of ethics and acts with this spirit is animal worship
 in drushti se kisi jati yaa vyakti ke shraddhabhaav ke kaaran pashuvishesh us jati yaa vyakti kii santatiyon kaa pratik bhi ban jaataa
 The practice of many animal related practices is far and wide in different parts of the world
 kintu inamen sabhi aachaar poojabhaavna se hi nahin kiye jate
 For worship, reverence for the revered and his wishes for auspiciousness and well-being are the main features
 aacharon ke anusaar pashupuja kii vividh kotiyaan banaai jaati hai
 On the basis of these categories, their sects are classified and these classifications are also based on the basic spirit of worship prevalent in those sects
 is bhaavana ke aadim swaroop kii vyakhya ke liye tatkaaleen maanav kii aasthaa ke mul kaarnon kii khoj aavashyak ho jaati he
 But on the one hand, there is no means available to know precisely the underlying spirit behind the acts and ethos of primitive animal worship; Secondly, the state of mind of modern human beings is very different since then
 at: aadhunik pashupuja kii bhaawanaaon tathaa kotiyon ke aadhaar par aadim pashupuja ke mul kaaran ke prati sambhavit drushtikon hi upasthit kiye ja sakate hai jo upyogetavaadi evam daivi athwa abhautik ho sakate hai
 History: The dark man of the past was much closer to animals than today
 yah nikatataa atmiyata or saahacharigat upyogita main bhi pratifalit ho sakati he or iske vipareet vah unke liye ghaatak, bhayotpadak tathaa vipattikar bhi siddh ho sakati he
 According to these possibilities, utilitarian approaches are dualistic - fear or self-protective and self-oriented
 bhay athwa aatmarakshamulak upyogetavaadi drushtikon ke anusaar manushya sadaa se anek praaniyon kii krurta or shakti ke aatank se natmastak hokar unke prati shraddhavanat hua taaki vah unase apni raksha kar sake
 In ancient Egypt, there was a practice of feeding fodder to the holy gongs and in modern times a similar practice is found in West Africa
 sambhavat: aadimsamaj main bhukhe ghadiyal se haani ke parinaamon par is pratha kaa prachlan aatmakalyaan kii bhaavana se hua ho
 But we cannot call it the worship of gharial as it is not related to reverence
 swarthmulak upyogetavaadi drushtikon ke anusaar pashupuja ke aachaar vishuddh swaarthbhaav se kiye jate hai taaki balipashu ke maance rup main bhojan saamagree sulabh ho sake
 When the dietary primitive human was not completely carnivorous and became dependent on food etc
 by becoming vegetarian, then some animals got connected with the fertility of the earth
 sarpapuja isi kaa parinaam he, kyonki vah us pataal lok kaa nivasee kalpit he jahaan se praapt jal dwaara fasalon tathaa vanaspatiyon kii sinchai hoti he or is prakaar uski krupa se aushadhi, ann or sampatti ke ke rup main vibhinn khaadya samagriyan sulabh hoti hai
 But by all means, the worship of the deity or the divine powers, not purely self-defense or self-respect towards the animal, does not mean worship
 isi prakaar balipashu kii haddi ke prati aadar bhaavana yaa jivit pashuvishesh kaa aadarsuchak namakaran pashupuja se bhinn drushtikon ke parinaam hai
 In practice, the divine or non-physical attitude of animal worship can be the root cause of worship spirit
 pashupuja ke kuch sampradaay is vishwaas ke aadhaar par viksit hue ki kuch pashuon kaa avichhinn sambandh divya shaktiyon yaa devataaon se he or sambandhit devtaa ko pashuvishesh kii puja dwaara prasann kiya ja saktaa he
 Some animals were considered to be symbols of the powers with corresponding characteristics of nature, according to the characteristics of their nature
 inke sambandh main puraavrit or puranic aakhyaan bhi bane
 In India, animal worship is related to the principle of taking birth in various forms of the soul
 pashupuja ke kuch sampradaay is vishwaas ke kaaran bhi chal pade ki manushya ke pitar mrityuparant pashuyoni main janm grahan karte hai
 From this point of view, animal worship is based on the beliefs or beliefs by which the "divine animal" is conceived
 is prakaar prakruti kii mahaan shaktiyon, pitaron, devataaon athwa daivi sristi ke praaniyon kaa pashurup main avatarit hone kii dharna he jiske saath bhay or swarthmulak drushtikon kaa mail parvarti he 
 Animal worship was uncommon and widely practiced in Egypt
 vahaan praaia: sabhi mukhya pashu puja ke paatr the jinamein kuch pashuon kii puja kaa swaroop aanchalik tha or kuch kaa saarvbhaum
 Conversely, in some areas, the venerated animal was also a hater in other areas
 pashupuja kii yah bhaavana itani badi ki jane yaa anjaane unki hatya karanevaalon kaa mrityudand tak diya gaya
 The eagle bird and the cat were all similar creatures
 kehete hai, rome ke raajnneetik dabaav main hone par bhi jab ek romi sainik ne mistra main billi kii hatya kar di to rome ke samraat ke anurodh ko bhi thukrakar mistre shaasha ne use prandand diya tha
 Some animals in Egypt were considered not only symbols of the deity but also avatar
 saand or bakre aise hi pashu the or inaki puja sambandhit devtaa athwa unke pratik rup main sarvatra vyaapt thi
 Pashupooja Pashupooja is often associated with the worship of deities
 puraanon tathaa prachlit sahitya main vibhinn devi devataaon kii shakti or unke vishisht lakshanon ke vishay main anek kathaayen milti hai
 Many legends related to them are also prevalent
 pracheen vaidic paramparaon main aasthaa rakhanevaale adhikansh bhartiya jan bahut se pashuon ko devi devataaon ke vaahan ke rup main pavitra maanate hai
 This notion of the sanctity of animals cannot be called a total cause
 pashu isliye pavitra nahin maan jate ki unki maanav praaniyon se naatedari he varan isliye ki unka upyog vibhinn devi devataaon ne vaahan ke rup main kiya he or karte hai
 Durga and Leo, Shiva and Vrishabha, Ganesha and Rat, Kartik and Mayur, Lakshmi and Owl, Saraswati and Hans and similarly other deities have been considered related to other animal birds respectively
 brahma kaa vaahan hans, kaam kaa makar, agni kaa bhed or varun kaa matsay he
 These animals have a special place in the Hindu antiquities and they are also inscribed in the idols of the gods and goddesses
 Hindus have different types of feelings towards the cow
 8veen shatabdi tak vaidic hinduon main gomance bhakshan kaa kattar virodh nahin miltaa
 a description of the banquet in Vashisht Muni's ashram in the Bhavabhutikrita North Ramcharit, to commemorate the deforestation of the family
 charak samhita main bhi murgi ke maance kaa samarthan atyant paushtik bhojan ke rup main kiya gaya he kintu baad main gaay ke prati vishesh bhaawanaaon kaa udai hua
 a cow milking like a mother was considered eligible to behave like a mother, and since then cow-cow and beef protests were planted
 hindu puraavrit or garhasthya jivan main sarp kaa mahatv sadaa hi mana gaya he
 Sheshnag has been conceived as a giant snake holding the Mother Earth on its millennia
 ek puranic katha ke anusaar vishwavyaapee pralay ke samay vishnu or lakshmi bhi sheshashayya par arudh hue the
 But the importance of snake is not only mythological
 aaj bhi kuch duurastha graamy pariwaron main kisi sarpvishesh kii puja grihadevataa ke rup main kii jaati he
 But even in this, the totem faith is not reflected
 yadhyapi punarjanm ke siddhant ko sabhi pramukh bhartiya chintanapranaaliyon me manyata di gai he or janmajanmantaron main aatma ke pashuon or paudhon main pravesh kii kalpana kii gai he, tathaapi yah vishwaas bharat main pashupuja kaa aadhaar kabhi nahin rahaa
 Veterinarians did not see any association between animals and humans
 pashuon tathaa ped paudhon main aatma ke pravesh kaa vishwaas keval saidhantik rup main mana gaya he
 Philosophers have emphasized the moral side of this theory but in the context of human systems
 yadhyapi vedavarnit pashupuja ke anarya mul ke sambandh main nishchit rup se kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, tathaapi desh ke duurastha pradeshon main vaas karanevaale anarya kabeelon main pashupuja or prachlan aaj bhi he, yaa nikat bhoot main tha
 Here the mention of beliefs related to the sanctity of trees associated with specific deities will also not be irrelevant
 aise vrikshon main ashwatth, vat, bilva, vakul, haritaki, aanwala, neem or tulsi mukhya hai
 Somewhere Tulsi has been called Narayanabhakta
 wiliam crooke ne aise bahut se dravid bhashabhashi kabeelon kaa varnan kiya he jo pashuvishesh se naata jodate hai
 The root of these beliefs is definitely totem
 chunki mirzapur kii ghanghar jati ke lakada kul ke namakaran kaa aadhaar ek prakaar kaa chita he, at: us kul ke sadsy chitah kaa maance nahin khate
 Eating leaves of the Vat tree is prohibited among the people of Bad Kul
 punjab ke sarp kabeeley main prayek somvaar or brihaspativaar ko sarppujan ke nimitt doodh chaaval pakaae jate hai
 On such a day, flowers are offered to the snake found dead and it is revered
 bahut se jatinaamon kaa aadhaar bhi billi, chuha, bagula, ajgar aadi pashu hai
 In the Ramayana and Mahabharata, there are stories of kings born of the sun and the moon
 kuch kathaon main raajputron kaa janm anhoni pasthitiyon main hota dikhaaya gaya he
 For example, in one story sixty thousand sons are born with a pumpkin
 rajasthan ke jaitava apane ko vanar kaa vanshaj bataate hai
 The belief of origins from snakes is found in the Chero caste of the Vindhya plateau
 chhata nagpur ke raja or pradhan, sir par, kundali markar baithe sarp kii anukriti main, safa bandhate hai
 According to a Santhali legend, this clan originated from a wild duck
 bengal ke baavariyon kaa totami chinh bagula he or isliye vah bagule kaa maance nahin khate
 Potters of Orissa worship fish for years and do not eat its flesh
 khandon or jaaton kaa ganchinh mor he
 In the Puranas, there are stories of incarnations of gods in their form
 bhagwaan vishnu varah, kurm or matsay rup main avatarit hue the
 These avatars have a respectable place in Hindu society

, are printed on cheap paper
 samachar patr sanchaar ke sadhano main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhte hai
 Newspapers are usually daily, but some newspapers are weekly, fortnightly, monthly and even half-yearly
 adhiktar samachaarpatr sthaneey bhashaaon main or sthaneey vishyon par kendrit hote hai
 The earliest known newspaper was 59 BC
 Is 'the Roman Acta Diurna'
 julies sisar ne janasadhran ko mahatvapurn rajnatijna or samaajik ghatnaon se avgat karaane ke liye unhe shahro ke pramukh sthano par preshit kiya
 Handwritten newspapers were introduced in China in the 8th century
 akhbaar kaa itihaas or yogadan: yun to british shashan ke ek purv adhikari ke dwaara akhabaaron kii shuruyaat maani jaati he, lekin uskaa swaroop akhabaaron kii tarah nahin tha
 It was only a one-page informational paper
 purnroopen akhbaar bengal se 'bengal-gajet' ke naam se vysarai hikki dwaara nikaala gaya tha
 Initially, the British used newspapers for their own benefit, as all newspapers were coming out in English, so news and information could not reach the majority of people
 jo khabaren baahar nikalakar aati thintra se guzarate, vahaan apana aatank failaate rahete the
 There were neither cases nor any punishment against them
 in naarkeey paristhitiyon ko jhelte hue bhi log khamosh the
 During this period, newspapers such as 'the Hindustan Times', 'national Herald', 'pioneer', 'mumbai-mirror' in India used to come out in English, in which there was no mention of those atrocities
 in angreji patron ke atirikt bangala, urdu aadi main patron kaa prakaashan to hota rahaa, lekin uskaa dayera simit tha
 Only a Bengali reader or a person who knew Urdu could understand it

 Now people started getting information about the events happening in the corner of the country
 lekin kuch hi samay baad is patr ke sampadak jugal kishor ko sahaayta ke abhaav main 11 disambar 1827 ko patr band karnaa padaa
 On 10 May 1829, the Hindi newspaper Bangdoot was published from Bengal
