 For the purpose of dance etc
, the design of the order and form of operation of different parts of the body is called choreography or choreography
 jo vyakti, nartak yaa kalakaar is kaary ko karata he, use 'nrityrachanaakaar' yaa nritysanyojak' yaa 'koreographer' kehete hai
 The history of dance is as ancient as the history of human life
 maanav jivan kii dainandin kriyakalapon main khushi ke avasaron ne lok nrityon ko janm diya
 These folk dances were always performed in groups
 in nrityon ke pad sanchaalan atyadhik saral hua karte the
 In most of the dances, people danced to form a circular circle, expressing their emotions with limited limb movements
 yah nrity itane sahaj va saral the ki koi dekhne vaala bhi inke saath lay taal main jhuumate hue nrity main shaamil ho jaataa tha
 This is to say that the structure of such dances was very simple
 bhartiya shastreey nrityon kii baat karen to kathak, odisi or bharatnatyam ko chhodkar anya sabhi nrity apane praarambhik swaroop main 'nritynaty' kii shrenee main aate the
 The performance of the group would have been performed by them as a dance drama, however the skill of group structure was not so much emphasized at that time
 purvi deshon kii bhanti pashchim ke deshon main bhi unke nrity kii ek samrudh parampara hamen praapt hoti he
 The art of 'choreography' is widespread in Western countries
 samooh rachana kii kala hamaare nrityon main bhi rahi he or madhyayugin granthon main 'samooh bandh' ke rup main hamen iske bare main jaankaree praapt hoti he
 The 'pindi Bandh' that Acharya Bharata also mentions in his Natyashastra - is related to the structure of the group itself
 bhartiya shastreey nrity main nartan ke tino bhedo nritt, naatay va nrity ke darshan alag-alag rup se bhalee-bhanti kiye ja sakate he
 The dance is composed of theater and dance and the development of this dance can be seen only in Indian dances
 haath va pairon ke lay va talbaddh sanchaalan ke saath jab geet ke shabdon ke anukool bhaavon kaa mail hota he tab vah nrity hota he or yah nrity darshakon ko pashchimi deshon ke nritt kii bhanti keval chamatkrit na hi karata he apitu unki aatma ko bhi sparsh karata he
 That is why ever since Indian dances have imbibed the art of choreography, a new attraction has arisen in them
 bhartiya nrityon main vishaygat vaividhyataa to he hi veshbhusha main bhi vividh rango kii chata he
 Therefore, the skill of group structure increases their influence manifold
 koreography se ek saral si nrity rachana ko bhi aakarshak banaaya ja saktaa he
 When performing a dance composition, the choreographer can combine a group of trained dancers in myriad ways to create unlimited shapes
 kathak nrity kii parampara main ye akritiyaan 'vyuh rachana' ke naam se jaani jaati he
 In solo dance performances these arrayed compositions could be presented through movements
 samooh main in rachanaaon kaa saundarya dwiguneet ho jaataa he
 Some of the figures presented in the group are as follows
 aaj ke electranik yug main darshako kii badalati ruchi ke saath saamanjasy banaae rakhane ke prayaas ne koreography ko or bhi adhik vistaar diya he
 If a group of 6 or 8 dancers display a single dance composition in place of a single dancer, then the variety, variety, and combination of dancers in many different sizes will definitely attract the audience
 bade samooh ko do yaa teen chote samoohon main baantkar kabhi ek sidhi lambii saral rekha to kabhi tirchhi rekha main nartako ko sanyojit kar kabhi ek bada gheraa banaakar uske andar chota gheraa banaakar, kabhi kuch nartako ko sthir tathaa kuch ko gatiman rakhkar, kabhi ek si gati or lay main ek jaise ang sanchaalan rakhkar vibhinn prakaar ke anginat sundar va aakarshak drishy bandho kii yojana kii ja sakati he
 Today the appearance of the stage has also changed completely
 aadhunik takanic se susajjit bade-bade aditorium, vividhta liye hue prakaash yojana, behtareen dhwani vyavastha aadi ne nrity pradarshan kii takanic ko bhi badal diya he
 This change is also inevitable
 vishaal manch par ek akelaa nartak utana prabhaav nahin paidaa kar paata he jitna ki nartakon kaa samooh karegaa
 The rise and fall of several hands at once, the use of illusions, the corresponding costumes and the corresponding light and sound combination is able to take the audience to the state of hypnosis
 koreographer yaa nrity sanyojak chaahe ekal nrity ho yaa samooh, nrity ke itihaas kaa sabase mahatvapurn vyakti he jo nartako ke padaghato va unki angik kriyaaon main saamanjasy dhundta he
 The plot expands the dance technique by combining the costumes of the dancers, the available stage instruments and the dancers in different situations and forms
 ek achche koreographer main nritykala vishay par acchhee pakad hone ke saath-saath usamen saundarya bodh kaa hona atyant aavashyak he
 Dance is visual, so it can be used in costumes, looks, and every instrument of stage effect
 ek kushal koreographer apni rachanaatmak pratibha se in sabhi kaa uchit prayog va pradarshan kar nrity rachana main chamatkaari prabhaav utpann kar saktaa he
 The art of choreography has also expanded in this era of change
 kam samay main adhik kah dena badi sankhya main nartako ko manch uplabdh karwaanaa, manch ke bade aakaar ko bade nartak samooh ke saath samanjit karnaa, tathaa vividhta banaae rakhte hue darshako kaa manoranjan karnaa, nishchit hi ek chunauteepurn kaary he
 Today the changing stage techniques, costumes, sound-lighting scheme, sets etc
 have provided an open sky for choreography to the choreographer, where he can give his imagination the desired flight

 According to the Constitution of India, the total number of ministers in the Council of Ministers should not exceed 15% of the total number of members of the Lok Sabha
 har mantri ko sansad kaa sadsy hona aavashyak hai; jo mantri sansad ke nichle athwa upree sadan kaa lagaataar 6 maheenon tak sadsy nahin, usase turant uskaa mantri pad chin liya jayega
 There are three categories of ministers, which are in descending order of rank - aspirin, jise acetilasalisylic acid, bhi kehete hai, ek salicyllette aushadhi he, jo akasar halke dardon se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye dardanivarak ke rup main, fever kam karne ke liye jvershamak ke rup main or shoth-nirodhi dawa ke rup main prayog main laai jaati he
 Aspirin also has an anti-platelet effect, which arises from the inhibition of thromboxane production, which in normal circumstances binds the molecules of platelets together to form a rash on the bruises within the blood vessels
 chunki plateleton kaa chakatta kaaphi bada hokar rakt-pravaah main us sthaan par yaa aage kahin bhi rukawat paidaa kar saktaa he, isaliye rakt ke thakkon ke vikaas ke adhik jokham vaale logon main aspirin kaa prayog lambey samay ke liye kam maatra main hridayaghat, mastishk-aghat or rakt ke thakkon kii rokthaam ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 It has also been found that a small amount of aspirin immediately after a heart attack can reduce the risk of another heart attack or cardiac tissue death
 aspirin ke, visheshkar adhik maatra main lene par, mukhya avaanchit dushprabhavon main amashay va aanton main chhaale, amashay main raktasrav or kaanon main aawaaj aana shaamil hai
 Due to the risk of Reye's syndrome in children and adolescents, aspirin is no longer used to control flu-like symptoms or symptoms of varicella or other virus diseases

 Today, aspirin is one of the most used drugs in the world, with an estimated intake of 40,000 tonnes per year
 jin deshon main aspirin bear kaa registerd trademark he, vahaan uskaa generik naam acetile seleselic acid he
 a French chemist, Charles Friedrich Gerhardt, first made acetylsalicylic acid in 1853
 vibhinn acid enhydron ke sanshleshan or gunon par uske kaary ke dauraan usne acetile chloride ko salicylic acid ke sodium lavan ke saath mishrit kiya
 a vigorous reaction ensued and the molten compound quickly solidified into a solid
 chunki un dinon main koi rachanaatmak siddhant nahin hua karata tha, isaliye jerheart ne us yogic kaa naam salicylic-acetic enhydride rakhaa
 
 This aspirin production was one of the many reactions Gerhardt did to his paper on anhydrides and did nothing further
 chah varsho ke baad, 1859 main won gilm ne salicylic acid or acetal chloride kii pratikriya dwaara vishleshnatmak rup se shuddh acetilasalicylic acid praapt kii
 In 1869, Schroeder, Prinzahrn and Kraut repeated the syntheses of both Gerhardt and von Gilm, and stated that both of these reactions yield the same compound — acetyl salicylic acid
 unhone pehali baar isaki sahi rachana–phinolic oxygen se jude acetile samooh–ke rup main darshai
 In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a low-dose replacement for common salicylate drugs in those days
 1899 tak bear ne iskaa naam aspirin rakh diya tha or duniya bhar main vikray karne lagi thi
 The name aspirin is derived from acetyl and spirsour - an old name for salicylic acid
 aspirin kii lokapriyata beesvin shatabdi main 1918 ke spanish flu kii vishwamahamari main iske sambhavit prabhaav ke kaaran bad gai
 But recent research suggests that the high death rate in the 1918 flu was due to aspirin to some extent, because the amount of aspirin used at the time can cause toxicity, fluid in the lungs and in some cases secondary bacterial infections, and fatal
 Might be possible

 The same chemical formula is used in all markets but each has its own packing and physical aspects
 aspirin migraine ke ilaaj ke liye prayukt mukhya aushadhiyon main se ek he, jo 50-60% maamalon main aaraam pahunchaati he
 This new tryptan drug is as effective as sumatriptan and other analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen
 aspirin, paracitamaal or caffeine kaa sanyog or bhi adhik prabhaavshaalee he
 For migraine headaches, this formula works better than taking all three components separately, and even better than ibuprofen and sumatriptan

 In relevant tension headaches, aspirin relieves pain in 60–75% of patients
 is drushti se, amashay va aanton main dushprabhavon kii adhikta ke sivaa, yah paracitamaal ke baraabar he
 Comparative clinical studies found that metamizole and ibuprofen can relieve pain more rapidly than aspirin, but this difference becomes negligible after about 2 hours
 aspirin main 60-130 migra caffeine mila dene par sirdard main dardanivarak asar bad jaataa he
 The combination of aspirin, paracetamol and caffeine is even more effective, but causes more abdominal discomfort, nervousness, and dizziness
 saamanytah aspirin halke, spandanyukt dard main acha kaam karti he
 It is not effective in the pain caused by most muscle spasms, flatulence, gastric dilation and skin irritation
 The most commonly studied pain example is post-surgical pain, such as post-tooth extraction, for which the most permissible amount of aspirin is equal to 1 gram paracetamol, 60 mg codeine, and 5 mg oxycodone
 akele aspirin ke mukaable aspirin or caffeine kaa sanyog dard se adhik raahat pahunchaata he
 Effervescent reduces pain faster than aspirin containing aspirin tablets
 phir bhi, shalyakriya ke baad prayukt dardanivarak ke rup main aspirin ibuprophen se kam asardaar he
 Aspirin causes more stomach and intestinal toxicity than ibuprofen
 aspirin kii adhiktam maatra ibuprophen kii madhyam maatra se kam dardanivarak kshamta rakhti he or yah raahat usase kam der tak bani rahati he
 The combination of aspirin and codeine has slightly more pain relieving capacity than aspirin alone, but clinically this difference does not matter much
 Ibuprofen seems to be at least equal to, or possibly more effective with, this combination
 maahvaaree ke dard ke liye kiye gaye naidanik adhyayanon ke ek vishleshan ke anusaar aspirin plasibo kii apeksha adhik lekin ibuprophen yaa napraksen kii apeksha kam prabhavakaari paaya gaya, haalanki in adhyayanon main aspirin kii adhiktam matraaon kaa prayog kabhi nahin kiya gaya
 The authors found that ibuprofen has the best risk-benefit ratio

 Secondary prevention is related to people already suffering from cardiovascular diseases
 mastishkaghaton or hridayaghaton kii dwitiyak rokthaam ke liye kam maatra main aspirin kii sifarish kii jaati he
 In both men and women diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, aspirin reduces the likelihood of heart attack and stroke resulting from blocked blood flow by up to 20 percent

 In people who do not suffer from cardiovascular diseases, the benefits of aspirin are not clear
 praathmik rokthaam ke prayogon main aspirin ne hridayaghat or kam raktapravaah se utpann mastishkaghat kii kul ghatnaon main 10 pratishat kii kami laai
 But, since these incidents are rare, the ultimate reduction in their rate was less -0
57% to 0
51% per annum
 In addition, the risks of hemorrhagic stroke and gastric and intestinal bleeding make the benefits of aspirin almost negligible

 united kingdom main bhi bacchon main aspirin ke prayog ke bare main chetavanee jari hone ke baad aisi hi kami dekhi gai
 The United States Food and Drugs Administration now recommends that aspirin should not be given to children under 12 for febrile treatment, and the British Metiches and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommends that children under 16 be treated without a doctor Aspirin should not be given as advised
 kuch logon main, aspirin ke kaaran allergy pratikriya ke samaan lakshan utpann ho sakate hai jinamein hikez, sujan or sirdard shaamil hai
 This reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance, and the inability to metabolize even a small amount of aspirin, rather than an actual allergy, leading to an overdose in the body
 aspirin kuch logon main angeoedima utpann kar sakati he
 Angioedema occurred 1–6 hours after taking aspirin in some people participating in a study
 lekin akele aspirin lene par in rogiyon main angeoedima nahin hui – angeoedima tab utpann hui jab aspirin kisi anya eneidi dawa ke saath lee gai

 Or the expected benefit of a reduction in stroke in women weighing more than the expected increase in gastrointestinal bleeding
 niyamit kam khuraaq main aspirin kaa prayog karne waalon main hradvahini rog se mrityu kaa jokham 25% kam or kisi bhi kaaran se mrityu kaa jokham 14% kam tha
 Using aspirin in low doses has also been found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and low doses of aspirin may prove to be effective and safe for patients who require aspirin for long-term prevention
 kawasaki rog se grast bacchon ko aspirin shaareerik vajan ke aadhaar par nishchit khuraaqon main di jaati he, prarambh main do hafton tak din main chaar baar or phir chah se aath hafton tak kam maatra main rojaanaa ek baar di jaati he
 Excessive intake of aspirin may be acute or chronic
 acute vishaaktata main, ek badi khuraaq lee jaati he, jabaki dirghakaalik vishaktata main saamaanya se adhik khuraaq lambey samay tak lee gai hoti hai
 The death rate from acute overdose is 2%

 Chronic overdose is particularly severe in children
 vishaaktata kaa upachaar anekon tareekon se kiya jaataa he, jaise – activated charcol, intravinus dextros or narmal sailine, sodium bicarbonate or dyalisis
 In 1971, British pharmacologist John Robert Wayne, who then worked at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, showed that aspirin reduced the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes
 is khoj ke liye unhen 1982 main physialaji or medicine, donon main nobel puraskaar diya gaya or nisehud se sammanit kiya gaya
 Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible neutralization of the cyclooxygenase enzyme
 cychlooxijnez kii aavashyaktaa prastaglandin or thrambaksen ke sanshleshan ke liye padati he
 Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent in place of the acetyl group attached to the serine residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme
 yah baat aspirin ko anya eneseidion se bhinn karti he, jo ki parivartaneey avarohak hote hai
 The use of long-term aspirin in small amounts irreversibly inhibits the production of thromboxane A2 in platelets, causing an inhibitory effect on platelet coagulation
 aspirin kaa yah skandan virdohi gun use hridayaghat kii ghatnaon ko kam karne main upyogi banaata he
 40 mg of aspirin per day can block a large proportion of maximal thromboxane A2 production without affecting the synthesis of prostaglandin I2
 lekin isse adhik avrodh ke liye aspirin kii adhik maatra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Prostaglandins are endemic hormones produced in the body and have various effects in the body, including sending pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation
 thrambaxenon kaa kaary plateleton kii jamaavat karnaa hota he jisase rakt ke thakke banate hai
 Heart attacks are primarily due to blood clots and low dose aspirin is useful for effective medical treatment of heart attacks
 iskaa mukhya dushprabhav yah he ki chunki rakt ke jamane kii kshamta kam ho jaati he, isaliye aspirin ke prayog se atyadhik rakt srav ho saktaa he
 There are at least two different types of cyclooxygenase - PTGS1 and PTGS2
 Aspirin irreversibly inhibits PTGS1 and modulates the enzymatic activity of PTGS2
 saamanytah pitijies2 prastenoidon kaa utpaadan karata he, jo adhikanshtah shothprerak hote hai
 Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, which are mostly anti-inflammatory
 amashyantreey dushprabhavon ko kam karne ke uddeshy se pitijies2 selective avarohak naamak nai eneidi dawaaon kaa vikaas kiya gaya he jo keval pitijies2 kaa avrodh karti hai
 However, many new ones such as Viacs have recently been withdrawn because there has been evidence that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack
 yah kaha gaya he ki sharir kii maheen raktanalikaaon kii bhitari parton main maujuud endothelial koshikaayen pitijies2 utpann karti hai or vishesh rup se pitijies2 kaa avrodh karne se prastaglandin ke utpaadan kaa thrambaksen ke mukaable downaregulation ho jaataa he, kyonki plateleton main pitijies1 aprabhavit rahete hai
 This removes the protective anticoagulant effect of PGI2, increasing the risk of thrombus and accompanying heart attacks and other hemorrhagic problems
 chunki plateleton main diene nahin hota he, ve ek baar aspirin dwaara anzime ko aparivartaneey rup se avaruddha kar dene ke baad nae pitijies kaa sanshleshan nahin kar sakate, jo ki aspirin kii parivartaneey avarodhakon kii tulana main mahatvapurn bhinnata he
 Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional mechanisms
 yah bhitari kala shunya se proton vaahak ke rup main mitrocandrial matrix, jahaan yah ek baar phir ynikrut hokar proton detii he, main waapas prasaarit hokar, cartillej ke mitocandria main oxykaarak phospharilation ko viyugalikrut karti he
 In short, aspirin transports the proteins by buffering them
 jab alpirin kii badi matraaen di jaati hai, to electron transport chen dwaara ooshmaa mukt kiye jane se aspirin vastav main fever utpann karti he, jabaki kam khuraaqon main aspirin bukhaar kam karti he
 In addition, aspirin promotes the formation of no-roots in the body, which have been shown to be independent mechanisms of reducing inflammation in mice
 yah shwet raktakanon ko aapas main chipakane se roktaa he, jo sankraman ke prati rakshaatmak pratikriya main mahatvapurn kadam he
 There is not enough evidence yet to prove that aspirin helps fight infection
 haal main praapt jaankaree ke anusaar aspirin or uske yogic sanketon ko nf-κb ke jariye madulate karte hai
 nf-κb is a transcription factor complex that plays a central role in many biological processes including inflammation
 aspirin hypothalemic-pituitary-adrenal dhuree dwaara asit or cartisal kaa srav karne ke baad vaisopracin ke prabhaavon ko kam or naloxon ke prabhaavon ko badhaati he
 It has been stated that this occurs through an interaction between endogenous prostaglandins and their role in controlling the HPA axis
 salicylic acid ek halkaa amla he or munh se lene ke baad isaki bahut kam maatra kaa amashay main ynikaran hota he
 Acetyl salicylic acid is much less soluble in the acidic state of the stomach, which can delay the absorption of large doses by 8 to 24 hours
 choti aant ke bade hue piech ke alaava, adhik satahi kshetrafal ke kaaran aspirin vahaan teji se avashoshit hoti he, jisase salicyllette adhik maatra main ghulte hai
 Due to solubility, the absorption of aspirin is very slow when taken in high doses and its concentrations in plasma can increase up to 24 hours after its intake
 rakt main salicyllette kaa lagbhag 50-80% protein se judaa hota he jabaki baaki maatra sakriy, ynikrut sthiti main hoti he
 Protein binding is dependent on the concentration
 bandhan ke sthanon ke santrupt ho jane par adhik mukt salicyllette kii uplabdhi or vishaaktata main vrudghi ho jaati he
 The volume of distribution is 0
1 to 0
2 l / kg
 acidosis main salicylleton ke utakon main adhik pravesh ke kaaran vitaran kaa aaytan bad jaataa he
 80% of the dose given for the treatment of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver
 glysine se sandhukt hokar salicyloorik acid banataa he or glucuronic acid se sanyukt hokar salissyle acil or phinalik glakuronide banate hai
 These metabolic pathways have limited capacity

 With large amounts of salicylate the kinetics is displaced from the first position to the void space, as metabolic pathways are saturated and the drainage from the kidneys increases in importance

 Geological evidence indicates that the Chilika Lake was part of the Bay of Bengal during the later stages of the Great Depression era
 chilka jhil ke thik uttar main khurda jile ke goglabai saasana gaanv main khudaai bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan vibhaag dwaara yojit kii gai
 The village of Golabai provides evidence of a view of the Chilika region culture in three stages: the Neolithic Age, the Tamerlan Age and the Iron Age, the King of Kalinga, was known as the "lord of the Sea"
 Ptolemy, the Greek geographer, referred to Palur as the port Paloura, located close to the point of departure situated outside of the southern tip of the lake at Kantiagarh, from where ships bound for different parts of Southeast Asia sailed
 After 639, the Chinese pilgrims fa-hien and hiuen-tsang mention a famous port "che-li-ta-loching" near the shore of the ocean which was a thoroughfare and resting place for seagoing traders and strangers from distant lands
 This port was located at ‘chhatragarh’ on the banks of Chilika Lake
 a fourth century legend, often told to explain the birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahhu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships
 To avoid detection, he stealthily anchored out of sight, off the mouth to the sea
 The deception was revealed by ships' refuse floating to the shore, thus warning the town's people, who escaped with all their possessions
 Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the seat that had betrayed him
 The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake
 Archeological excavations discovered Seventh century ship anchors and stone memoirs dedicated to battle heroes at a village named Kanas, about 25 kimi north of Chilika on the banks of Nuna river, which flows into the lake
 This gives evidence of an historic naval engagement off the coast
 a 10th-century text, the Brahmanda Purana, mentions Chilika Lake as an important center of trade and commerce, and a shelter for ships sailing to Java, Malaya, Singhala, China and other countries
 This suggests that the lake was then deep enough for berthing seagoing ships and had a channel to the sea big enough for loaded trading ships embarking to Southeast Asia
 The villagers around Chilika Lake still observe an annual festival called "bali Yatra"
 In 1803, the British entered the shores of the lake, reached Puri and occupied Odisha with the help of Fateh Muhammed
 Fateh Muhammed in turn was rewarded by the British with freehold of the areas of Malud and Parikud, of the present day Garh Krishnaprasad revenue block
 Over the years, poets including Kabibar Radhanath Ray and Pandit Godavarish Mishra, freedom fighters and paints have extolled historicity of the lake as pertinent to its cultural, spiritual, religious and scenic aspects
 “gopabandhu Das, a famous Odiya poet, became impatient to see the beauty of the march of colorful sights and sounds of Chilika lagoon while going by train
 He asked the speeding train to stop for a moment so that he could enjoy the beauty
 It is because of the beauty that arrests him much”
 The lake is a tidal delta type ephemeral lake in an environment with changing climate

 The land based system comprises distributaries of the Mahanadi River on the northern side, 52 river channels from the western side and the Bay of Bengal on the eastern side
 Two of the three southern branches of the Mahanadi River that trifurcates at Cuttack, feed the lake
 61%) of the total fresh water inflow into the lake is contributed by these two branches
 The second drainage system which is non–perennial accounts for 39% )
 The important rivers of this drainage system are the Kansari, the Kusumi, the Janjira and the Tarimi rivers
 The annual total surface freshwater input to the lake is estimated to 1
76 ghankilo meter including direct precipitation over the lake contributing 0
87 ghankilo meter All the inland river systems disgorge an annual flow of about 0
375 million ghan meter of freshwater which is estimated to carry 13 million metric tons of silt into the lake
 On the north east a channel connects the lake to the Bay of Bengal
 a tropical monsoon climate prevails over the drainage basin area of the lake

 Because of its rich biodiversity, Chilka Lake was chosen as a wetland of international importance in 1981 according to the Ramsar Manifesto, as the facts have shown: in varshon main, jhil ke paristhitiki tantra ko kai samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa or iname se kuch khatre nimnlikhit he: The rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture of prawn has contributed significantly to the decline of the lakes fisheries and bird population
 Concerted action was initiated by the Odisha State Government with support from the Government of India to adopt adaptive conservation and management actions
 By 1993, the problems in Chilika were so severe that the lake was put under "the Montreux Record" as the lake was considered to have "undergone, to be undergoing, or to be likely to undergo change in its ecological character brought about by human action ”
 The purpose was to stimulate remedial measures for the lake's conservation, supplemented with adequate monitoring
 It was expected that such an action would benefit from the advice from Ramsar Advisory Mission and other identified technical assistance programmes

 In 1992, the Government of Odisha, concerned by the degradation of the lake's ecosystem and cognizant of significant numbers of people who were dependent upon the lake's resources, set up the Chilika Development Authority
 The CDA was set up for restoration and overall development of the lake under the Indian Societies Registration Act as a parastatal body under the administrative jurisdiction of the Forest and Environment Department, with the following charter: The governing body of the Authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Odisha State and has people’s representatives, representatives of the fisherfolk communities and secretaries of the key departments, experts and eminent scientists as its members
 In 1998, an executive committee constituted with financial authority, supplemented with financial support from the Tenth and Eleventh Finance Commissions of the Government of India, gave support to the management initiatives taken up by CDA
 This facilitated a coordinated approach to plan and implement effective ameliorative management actions
 An Integrated Management Plan was implemented with financial support of Rs 570 million out of “special problem grants” recommended by the Finance Commissions
 Hydrobiological monitoring was supported under the Odisha Water Resources Consolidation Project of the World Bank, to the extent of Rs 10 million 
 a strong support network was created with 7 state government organizations, 33 ngos, 3 national government ministries, 6 other organizations, 11 international organizations, 13 research institutions and 55 different categories of community groups
 In 2003, collaboration of Indian and Japanese experts led to a friendly relationship between Chilika lake and Saroma Lake in Japan called Sister Wetlands
 Considering the threats faced by the lake, the National Wetlands, Mangroves and Coral Reefs Committee of the Ministry of Environment & Forests, bharat sarkaar, also identified the lake as a priority site for conservation and management
 The ameliorative actions taken by the CDA to restore the ecosystem and to improve the socio-economic conditions of the communities living around the lake and on its islands involved the following
 The most effective ameliorative action was the hydrological intervention of opening the new lake mouth and channel to the sea through the barrier beach at Satapura
 This improved the spatial and temporal salinity gradients of the lake to maintain the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system
 This intervention was completed after detailed scientific studies, including 3-dimensional mathematical modeling and hydraulics studies on a model prototype, were carried out by the Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune and National Institute of Oceanography, Goa
 In September 2000, the desiltation of the channel connecting the lake to the sea and opening of a new mouth to restore the natural flows of water and salinity levels was carried out
 These actions resulted in a notable increase in the lake ' s fish yield and a reduction of freshwater weeds
 The new mouth reduced the length of the outflow channel by 18 kilometers
 Opening of the new mouth provided a favorable increased salinity regime throughout the lake with less fluctuations and improved water clarity
 Detailed results of this action can be seen in the references cited in External sources
 Other measures included: In 2002, Chilika was taken out of the Montreux Record, in light of the improved conditions of the lake
 Chilika lake is the first Ramsar site in Asia to beremoved from the Montreux record
 The ecological richness of the lake is of great value in preserving the genetic diversity because of the multiplicity of its habitat, flora and fauna
 
 The Zoological Survey of India surveyed the lake between 1985 and 1988 and identified 800 species of fauna, including many rare, endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, but excluding terrestrial insects
 The rare and threatened animal species are identified green sea turtle, dugong, Irrawaddy dolphin, blackbuck, spoon billed sandpiper, limbless skink and fishing cat
 24 mammalian species were reported
 37 species of reptiles and amphibians are also reported
 Recent surveys revealed an overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families
 This represents about one –fourth of the vascular plant species of the Odisha state where some 2900 species altogether are found
 Fabaceae is the most dominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 Certain species were found to be characteristic of specific islands
the flora is predominantly of aquatic and sub-aquatic plants
 Overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families have been recorded
 Fabaceae is the predominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 The species reported are leguminosae, poaceae, and cyperaceae; endemic cassipourea ceylanica; five species of seagrass, and more
important species identified are:
 Chilika Lake is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds, on the Indian sub-continent
 It is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the country
 Some species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened animals inhabit the lake for at least part of their life cycle
 White bellied sea eagles, greylag geese, purple moorhen, jacana, flamingos, egrets, gray and purple herons, bharaten roller, storks, white ibis, spoonbills, brahminy ducks, shovellers, pintails, and more
 Migratory water fowl arrive here from as far as the Caspian Sea, Baikal Lake and remote parts of Russia, Mongolia, Lakah, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and from the Himalayas
 a census conducted in the winter of 1997–98 recorded about 2 million birds in the lake
 In 2007, nearly 840,000 birds visited the lake, out of which 198,000 were spotted in Nalbana Island
 On 5 Jan 2008, a bird census involving 85 wildlife officials counted 900,000 birds of which 450,000 were sighted in Nalabana
 Removal of invasive species of freshwater aquatic plants, especially water hyacinth, due to restoration of salinity, is a contributing factor for the recent increasing attraction of birds to the lake
 Nalbana Island is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands of Chilika Lake
 Nalbana means a weed covered island in the Odia language
 It is a major island in the center of the lake and has an area of 15
53 km 2
 The island gets completely submerged during the monsoon season
 As the monsoon recedes in the winter, lake levels decrease and the island is gradually exposed, birds flock to the island in large numbers to feed on its extensive mudflats
 Nalbana was notified in 1987 and declared a bird sanctuary in 1973 under the Wildlife Protection Act
 As per the Chilika Development Authority’s updated data, 323 aquatic species, which includes 261 fish species, 28 prawns and 34 crabs are reported out of which sixty five species breed in the lake
 27 species are freshwater fishes and two genera of prawns
 The remaining species migrate to the sea to breed
 21 species of herrings and sardines of the family Clupeidae are reported
 Between 1998–2002, 40 fish species were recorded here for the first time and following the reopening of the lake mouth in 2000, six threatened species have reappeared, including: For centuries fisher folk evolved exclusive rights of fishing through a complex system of partitioning the fisheries of the lake, harvested the lake in a relatively sustainable fashion and developed a large range of fishing techniques, nets and gear
 During the British Rule, in 1897–98, the fishermen community enjoyed exclusive fisheries rights in the lake
 The fisheries of the lake were part of the Zamindari estates of Khallikote, Parikud, Suna Bibi, Mirza Taher Baig and the Chaudhary families of Bhungarpur and the Khas mahal areas of Khurda, lying within the kingdoms of the Rajas of Parikud and Khallikote
 The zamindars leased out the fisheries exclusively to the local fisherfolk
 With the abolition of zamindari system in 1953, traditional fishing areas continued to be leased out to cooperatives of local fishermen
 Fishing, particularly, prawn fishing, became increasingly remunerative with outside interest playing an important role
 But in 1991, when the government of Odisha proposed a leasing policy that would have resulted in the auction of leases to the highest bidder, the Fishermen’s cooperatives challenged the order in court
 The High Court of Odisha ordered the Government to enact changes that would protect the interests of traditional fishermen and since then no new leases have been reported
 This has resulted in a chaotic regime in which powerful vested interests from outside dominate, and the local people have been subordinated
 Butter catfish and Wallago attu are the most common type of fish found in the lake
 11 species of fish, 5 species of prawn and 2 crab species are commercially important
 The commercially important prawn are giant tiger prawn, Indian prawn, Metapenaeus monoceros, Metapenaeus affinis and Metapenaeus dobson
 Mangrove crab is the most important commercial crab
 Fish landings in the lake, which fluctuated in the past, have recorded a remarkable recovery after the opening of the new mouth and dredging of silt –choked old mouth Magarmukh in 2000–2001, resulting in a better intermixing of the tidal influx from the sea and freshwater inflow from rivers
 Against an all time lowest landing of fish and prawn of 1,269 mass in 1995–96, the all-time high is reported to be 11, 878 mass during 2001–2002 resulting in an estimated per capita income for the fisher folk of Rs 19,575 during the year
 Recently, the Government of Odisha has issued a notification banning the lease of Chilika Lake for Culture Fishery
 The Irrawaddy dolphin is the flagship species of Chilika lake
 Chilka is home to the only known population of Irrawaddy dolphins in Indiaand one of only two lagoons in the world that are home to this species
it is classified as critically endangered, in five of the six other places it is known to live
 a small population of Bottlenose dolphins, also migrate into the lagoon from the sea
 Chilika fishermen say that when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return towards the lake
 Some Irrawaddy dolphins used to be sighted only along the inlet channel and in a limited portion of the central sector of the lake
 After the opening of the new mouth at Satapada in 2000, they are now well distributed in the central and the southern sector of the lake
 The number of dolphins sighted has varied from 50 to 170
 a 2006 census counted 131 dolphins and the 2007 census revealed 138 dolphins
 Out of the 138 dolphins, 115 were adults, 17 adolescents and six calves
 60 adults were spotted in the outer channel followed by 32 in the central sector and 23 in the southern sector
 Dolphin tourism provides an important alternative source of income for many local residents
 There are four tourist associations in Satapada employing three hundred and sixty 9-HP long-tail motor boats taking tourists to a 25 km 2 area of the lake for dolphin watching
 About 500 fishing families are involved in this business
 The Odisha Tourism Department and the Dolphin Motorboat Association, an NGO at Satpada, report about 40,000 tourists visit Chilika every year for dolphin Watching
 October – January and May – June are the peak season for tourists at Chilika, with a maximum of 600–700 per day during December – January
 The Dolphin Motorboat Association has 75 8-passenger motorboats for dolphin watching
 Tourists pay Rs
 250 for 60–90 minutes per trip
 According to the Association, most tourists see dolphins
 Only 5% return disappointed
 Besides the Association, the Odisha Tourism Department organises "dolphin-watch" for tourists
 Even during monsoon, about 100 tourists / day visit the lake
 Boat based dolphin watching tours impact dolphin behavior and cause several accidental dolphin deaths each year
 CDA conducts an annual census of dolphin deaths
 They report 15 deaths in 2003-04, 11 in 2004-05, 8 in 2005-06 and 5 in 2006-07
 40% of the 2006-07 deaths were by mechanised boats
 Since 2004, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been conducting a science based community education project to conserve the Irrawaddy dolphins and Chilika Lake
 They have determined the primary cause of mortality for this population of dolphins is floating gill nets and hook line fisheries and the secondary cause is boat strikes from increasing unmanaged tourism activities
 The Irrawaddy dolphins have a seemingly mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with the traditional fishermen
 Fishermen recall when they would call out to the dolphins, to drive fish into their nets
 Castnet fishing with the help of Irrawaddy dolphins in upper reaches of the Ayeyawady River has been well documented
 Nalaban Is land: The 15 km2 Nalaban Island is within the Lagoon and is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands

 The other areas where high concentrations of birds are recorded are Gerasara, Parikud Island, and the western shores of the Northern sector
 Chilka Lake is one of the best bird watching spots in India, and is also popular for fishing and angling
 Puri: This holy city is famous for the late 11th century built Jagannath temple
 The other major attraction here is the beach, from where you can witness the glorious sunrise and equally mesmerising sunset
 It’s said that a visit to Puri is incomplete without visiting Chilika Lagoon
 The Nirmaljhara Waterfall: This is an ideal place for pitching your picnic tent
 The beautiful waterfall is located nearly 12 km from Chilika Lagoon
 Satpada: This place is located at a distance of around 55 kimi from Puri, on the eastern side of the Chilika Lake
 This place is surrounded by lagoons from the three sides, which makes this place an amazing tourist spot for nature lover
 The open air and scenic natural flora and fauna of the lake are an attraction for eco-tourism
 This is expected to provide a degree of alternate employment to the local community and generate environmental awareness, among local residents as well as visitors, about the conservation and wise use of the lake's natural resources
 The locations within the lake identified for such activity are: The lake is well connected by road to Chennai and Kolkata through National Highway No 5
 Satpara town on the eastern bank of the lake is about 50 kimi by road southwest of the city of Puri and at a distance of 100 kimi from Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which is also the nearest airport
 a broad gauge railway line of the South Eastern Railway from Kolkata skirts along the western bank of the lake passing through Balugaon, Chilika and Rambha stations
 Within the lake precincts, Odisha Tourism Development Corporation Ltd and the Revenue Department of the state government offer boat cruises
 Private operators also provide country boats on hire to various islands in the lake
 There are OTDC Guest houses at Barkul, Rambha, Satapada & several hotels at Balugaon

 Mahishasura has taken away all the rights of Surya, Indra, Agni, Vayu, Moon, Yama, Varuna and other deities and himself became the master of heaven
 devataaon ko mahisasur ke prakope se prithvi par vicharan karnaa pad rahaa he
 Then, angry with this daring of Mahishasura, the gods created Goddess Durga
 aisa mana jaataa he ki devi durga ke nirmaan main saare devataaon kaa ek samaan bal lagaaya gaya tha
 To destroy Mahishasura, all the gods gave their weapons to the goddess Durga and it is said that with the combined effort of these gods, the goddess Durga became more powerful

 During Navaratri, some devotees fast and pray for protection of health and prosperity

033 Arun Kamal is an eminent poet of modern-day progressive thought-rich, natural style in contemporary Hindi literature
 sahitya academy puraskaar praapt is kavi ne kavita ke atirikt aalochana bhi likhi hai, anuwaad kaary bhi kiye hai tathaa lambey samay tak suprasiddh saahitiyik patrika aalochana kaa sampadan bhi kiya he
 Arun Kamal's real name is 'arun Kumar'
 saahitiyik lekhan ke liye unhone 'arun camel' naam apanaaya or yahi naam unki swaabhaavik pahchaan ban gaya he
 He was born on 15 February 1954 in Nasriganj in Rohtas district of Bihar
 peshey se ve patna vishvavidhyalay ke angreji vibhaag main praadhyaapak hai
 Arun Kamal is one of the prominent poets active after the chaotic period of sixty-eight writing
 kavita kii vaapasi varsh ke rup main prakhyat 1980 main unki pehali pustak 'apni keval dhar' prakashit hui or isi pustak ne unhen samakaleen daur ke ek mahatvapurn kavi ke rup main sthapit kar diya
 The line of the poem titled 'dhar' in this book got engraved on the tongue of every reader - saamaanya jan ke sarvhaara hote jane ke baavjood unamem nihit aantarik shakti tathaa parivartan kii sambhaavna kaa sahaj kalatmak parichay dene vaali yah pankti atyadhik lokapriy hui
 In 1989, his second collection 'proof' was published and in 1996 the third collection 'nayi Territory Mein' for which he was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award
 kavita ke atirikt arun camel ne samay-samay par aalochanatmak niabandh bhi likhe hai, vaktavy diye hai evam vibhinn vishyon par tippaniyan kii hai
 In fact, he is mainly a poet and criticism is not an essential part of his writing
 ve swayan aalochanatmak lekhan ke liye kisi atirikt prerana ko aavashyak maanate hai
 According to him "without regular journal or institute it is difficult to nurture criticism
 aalochana hameshaa maidani yani outdoor khel he
 "despite this, whenever they adopt critical writing, they take it seriously
 unke is aalochanatmak udhyam kii style peshewar aalochakon se sarvatha bhinn he
 Whether the subject is a poem or a contemporary issue, the main function of Arun Kamal is to get to the bottom of the subject like a diver and expose his heart, followed by the left-right
 unki aalochana "khaasi anaupchaarik kism kii aalochana ko prachlit shabd-roodhiyon se bachaakar kavita kii samvednaatmak banaavat main pravesh karti he or sahaj bhav-bodh kii sataha par use utaarti he
 Frankly speaking, the criticism of Arun Kamal is active criticism for the identification of life-righteous work
 yun to koi bhi rachana kabhi jivan-virdohi nahin hoti, lekin thos saamaajik aashay se samprukt na hone par vah pathak ko amoort bhav-sthitiyon kii ore le ja sakati he
 For Arun Kamal, the life-style of creation means his social wealth
 " This is the reason why Arun Kamal, despite being associated with a particular ideology, considers factionalism completely unsuitable for literature and on the one hand, while expressing extreme sympathy to Dr
 Namwar Singh, considers him to be 'proud of the interest of Hindi'
 Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma also accepts the immortality of Indian Manisha
 sharma ji ke sakaaratmak lekhan ke atirikt unke vivaadit lekhan ke sandarbh main bhi arun camel kii spasht manyata he ki "ramvilas ji ke lekhan tathaa vichaaron-manyataon ne jitne bhi pratyakraman yaa 'vivaad' aamantrit kiye ve sab ke sab anivaary tathaa mahatvapurn hai
 " moulik lekhan ke atirikt arun camel ne anuwaad kaary bhi kiya he
 a translation book of poems and commentaries of the Vietnamese poet 'to Hu', a translation of Mykowski's autobiography and a book of translations of Indian youth poetry in English called 'voices' have been published
 kipoling kii jangal book kaa anuwaad bhi unhone kiya he
 Apart from this, Hindi translations of poems and articles of many writers of the country and abroad have been published in various journals and magazines
 ve prabhaat khabar main har pakhwaade 'anuswaar' naamak ek anuwaad-stambh likhte rahe hai
 In between, he also wrote occasional commentaries in the 'jan-gana-mana' column for the Navbharat Times and also wrote for the Internet magazine 'literate World'
 arun camel afroeshian yuva lekhak sammelan, brajavile, congou main bharat ke pratibhaagi rahe
 Made literary trips to Russia, China and England
 ve sahitya academy kii saamaanya parishad evam salaahkaar samiti ke sadsy tathaa hindi sahitya sammelan, prayag kii kaarysmiti ke sadsy bhi rahe
 He also handled the responsibility of editing the literary magazine 'criticism' to be published under the Editor-in-chief of Namwar Singh for a long time
 'aalochana' ke sahasrabdi ank 21 se 51 tak kaa sampadan unhone kiya
 During this period important issues focused on Hazari Prasad Dwivedi as issue 28 and issue 40 to 43 focused on Shamsher, Agnayya, Kedarnath Agarwal and Nagarjuna
 ek dianemo, mul rup se vidyut janarator kaa doosraa naam he
 This usually means a generator or generator that generates direct current using a commutator
 dianemo pehle vidyut janarator the jo udyog ke liye vidyut shakti ke utpaadan main sakasham the
 Several other power generating transformers later developed based on the principle of dynamo, including electric motors, alternating current generators and rotary converters
 vartmaan samay main vidyut utpaadan ke liye inkaa upyog kabhi kabhi hi kiya jaataa he, kyonki aaj prayavarti dhara kaa prabhutv bad gaya he, commutator utana laabhakaari nahin rahaa or thos avasthaa vidhiyon kaa upyog karke prayavarti dhara ko aasaani se disht dhara main roopaantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Even today, in some situations, the term 'dynamo' is used in many places for generators
 ek chota vidyut janarator, jise roshni paidaa karne ke liye saaikal ke pahiye ke hub main banaaya jaataa he, 'hub dianemo' kehalaata he, haalanki ye hameshaa prayavarti dhara upkaran hote hai
 The energy of mechanical rotation is converted into a direct electric current according to Faraday's law using a coil of rotating wires and a magnetic field in a dynamo
 dianemo main ek sthir saranchana hoti he, jise 'stater' kaha jaataa he, jo ek sthir chumbakeey kshetra uplabdh karaati he
 And a set of rotating windings, called armature, it rotates rapidly in the magnetic field
 chumbakeey kshetra main taar kii gati ke kaaran dhaatu main upasthit electronon par bal utpann hota he, jisase taar main vidyut dhara utpann hoti he
 In small machines, the constant magnetic field can be provided by one or more permanent magnets; In large machines, the stationary magnetic field is provided by one or more electromagnets, commonly called field coil
 commutator kii aavashyaktaa disht dhara ke utpaadan ke liye hui
 When a loop of wire rotates in a magnetic field, the induced potential in it reverses after every half rotation, resulting in the alternating current produced
 haalanki, vidyutiya prayogon ke praarambhik dinon main, prayavarti dhara kaa koi gyaat upyog nahin tha
 In some uses of electricity, such as electroplating, liquid current was used with the help of liquid batteries
 dianemo kaa avishkaar bydaree ke pratisthaapan ke rup main kiya gaya
 The commutator is broadly a rotary switch
 isamen mashin ke shaft par chadhaaye gaye samparkon kaa ek set hota he, jinhen grafite-block ke steshnari samparkon ke saath sanyojit kiya jaataa he, jo "brush" kehalaate hai, kyonki sabase pehle lagaaye gaye is prakaar ke sampark dhaatu ke brush the
 When the voltage reverses, the commutator reverses the Waindings connection to the external circuit, so instead of alternating current, a direct current is produced
 pehle electric janarator kaa avishkaar 1831 main maaikel farade ke dwaara kiya gaya, isamen tambe kii ek discs ko chumbak ke dhruvon ke bich ghumaya gaya tha
 It was not a dynamo because it did not use a commutator
 baharhaal, farade kii discs bahut kam voltage utpann karti thi kyonki chumbakeey kshetra main vidyut dhara kaa keval ek hi path pravaahit ho rahaa tha
 Faraday and others found that this winding could produce higher and more useful voltages if the coil was twisted several times to form a coil
 taar kii windings main gheron kii sankhya ko badal kar koi bhi vaanchit voltage aasaani se praapt kii ja sakati he
 Therefore the same feature was used in all later generator designs, requiring the invention of the commutator to produce just the direct current
 1827 main, hungary ke anyos jedic ne vidyut chumbakeey ghurnak upkarnon ke saath prayog karne shuru kiye, jinhen unhone vidyut chumbakeey swa-roter kaha
 ek dhruv ke vidyut starter ke prototip main, sthir or ghurnan karne vaale donon bhaag vidyut chumbakeey the
 He proposed the concept of the dynamo about six years before Siemens and Wheatstone, but did not patent it because he thought he was not the first to do so
 unke dianemo main sthaayee chumbakon ke bajaay, ek dusre ke vipareet do vidyut chumbakon kaa upyog kiya gaya tha, jo roter ke chaaron or chumbakeey kshetra prerit karti thim
 It was also the discovery of the principle of dynamo self-induction
 farade ke siddhant par aadhaarit pehle dianemo kaa nirmaan 1832 main ek francisi upkaran nirmaataa hippolit piksi ke dwaara kiya gaya
 It used a permanent magnet which rotated through a crank
 ghoomte hue chumbak ko is prakaar se rakhaa gaya tha ki vidyutarodhi taar main lapeta gaya lohe kaa ek tukdaa iske uttari or dakshini dhruvon ke bich main se hokar gujarata tha
 Pixie found that every time the pole and the coil pass through each other, an electric current is impulse in the wire
 haalanki, chumbak ke uttari or dakshini dhruv vipareet dishaao main dhara ko prerit karte hai
 To convert the alternating current into a direct current, Pixie discovered the commutator, a split metal cylinder on the shaft, with two metal spring contacts both between the shafts
 in praarambhik diginon main ek samasya thi: inke dwaara utpann vidyut dhara main dhara ke "aavegon" kii ek shrinkhalaa hoti thi, jo ek duusare se bilkul alag nahin hote the, jiske parinamswaroop ausat shakti kaa utpaadan kam hota tha
 Likewise in the electric motor of that time, designers could not fully understand the serious detrimental effects of large air gaps in the magnetic circuit
 Antonio Pacinotti, an Italian professor of physics, solved this problem in the 1860s
 iske liye unhone ghurnan karti hui dwi-dhruvi aksheeya kundali ko bahu-dhruvi toroid kundali se pratisthapit kar diya
 To make a toroid, they wrapped the waddings continuously on an iron ring and attached it to the commutator at equal distance points around the ring; With this, the commutator was divided into several segments
 iskaa arth yah tha ki kundali kaa kuch hissaa lagaataar chumbak main se hokar guzar rahaa tha, jisase dhara nirantar ho gayi
 The first practical designs of the dynamo were announced separately and together by Dr
 Warner Siemens and Charles Wheatstone
 17 janvari 1867 ko, cemens ne berlin academy main "dianemo-electric mashin" kii ghoshnaa kii, jisamen stater kshetra utpann karne ke liye sthaayee chumbakon ke bajaay swayan power utpann karne vaale vidyut chumbakeey kshetra kundaliyon kaa upyog kiya gaya tha
 The same day Charles Wheatstone read a paper at the Royal Society, announcing a similar design, with the difference being that the stator electromagnets were in series with the rotor in the design of Siemens, while they were parallel in Wheatstone's design
 sthaayee chumbak ke bajaay vidyut chumbak kaa upyog ek dianemo kii shakti utpadaan kii dar ko atyadhik badha detaa he or is tarah se pehali baar ucch urja kaa utpaadan kiya gaya
 This invention was directly used for large scale industrial production of electricity
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1870 ke dashak main cemens ne dhaatu or anya saamagree ke utpaadan ke liye vidyut arq fernence ko urja dene ke liye vidyut chumbakeey dianemo kaa upyog kiya gaya
 Zenobe Village rediscovered Pacinotti's design in 1871 when designing the first commercial power plant, which operated in Paris in the 1870s
 gram ke dizin kaa ek or phayda yah tha ki isamen chumbakeey flux ke liye ek behatar flux kaa upyog kiya gaya tha, iske liye chumbakeey kshetra vaale sthaan ko baari louh kor se bhar diya gaya or steshnari evam ghurnan karne vaale bhaagon ke bich vaayu antaraal ko nunatam kar diya gaya
 Gram's dynamo was the first machine that could produce commercial quantities of electric power for industry
 baad main gram ring par sudhaar kiye gaye, lekin taar ke ghoomte hue antaheen loop kii mul avadharana ko sabhi aadhunik dianemo main banaaye rakhaa gaya he
 Charles F
 Brush compiled his first dynamo in 1876, in which a horse-drawn treadmill was used to produce power
 america patent # 189997 "improvement in magnetic electro machines" ko 24 april 1877 main jari kiya gaya
 The brush started with Gram's original design, with the wires on the side and the inner part of the ring being outside the zone's effective zone and retaining excessive heat
 is dizin main sudhaar karne ke liye, uski ring armechar kii akruti ko ek discs ke rup main banaaya gaya jabaki gram kaa armechar belanaakaar tha
 Instead of placing field electromagnets around the perimeter, the armature was placed on the lateral side of the disc
 isamen chaar vidyut chumbakon kaa upyog kiya gaya tha, do uttari dhruv vaale or do dakshini dhruv vaale
 The luggage poles were placed opposite each other, placed on each side of the disk armature
 1881 main brush electric company ke ek dianemo ko; 89 inch lanbaa, 28 inch chaudaa or 36 inch unchaa darj diya gaya, iskaa vajan 4800 pound tha or yah lagbhag 700 ghurnan prati minute kii gati se chalata tha
 It was considered the world's largest dynamo at that time
 isamen 40 arq liton kaa upyog hota tha or iske liye 36 horse power kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 Although it was not originally designed for the purpose, it was found that a dynamo could work as an electric motor when supplied with direct current from a battery or another dynamo
 At an industrial exhibition in Vienna in 1873, Gram found that the shaft of his dynamo began to rotate when its terminal was accidentally connected to another dynamo producing electricity
 haalanki yah ek vidyut motor kaa pehla pradarshan nahin tha, lekin yah pehla vyaavhaarik pradarshan tha
 It was found that the same features in the design that make the dynamo effective also make the motor effective, Gram's effective design, which had shorter magnetic wind gaps, and multiple coil coils connected to a multiple-split commutator Was, it became the basis of the design of all practical direct current motors
 disht dhara utpann karne vaale bade dianemo un sthitiyon main samasyajanak hote the jahaan do yaa adhik dianemo ek saath kaam kar rahe hote hai or ek kaa ingine duusare kii tulana main kam power par chal rahaa hota he
 Instead of rotating a low capacity engine, a dynamo with a high capacity engine starts to run a dynamo with a low capacity engine as if it were a motor
 aisi reverse driving se dianemo kaa ingine chalane lagata he or kam kshamta vaale dianemo main khatarnaak reverse spinning kii sthiti utpann ho sakati he, jo niyantran se baahar ho jaati he
 Finally it was found that when multiple dynamos are connected to a similar power source simultaneously, they all start running simultaneously using a jackshaft connecting the engines and these imbalances occur in the rotor
 asi janarator kii khoj ke baad, jab vastav main prayavarti dhara kaa upyog kisi bhi sthaan par kiya ja saktaa tha, shabd dianemo kaa upyog vishesh rup se commutator se yukt disht dhara vidyut janarator se sambandhit ho gaya, jabaki prayavarti dhara janarator main slip ring yaa roter chumbak kaa istemaal kiya jane laga, jise alternetr kaha jane laga
 AC electric motors that used slip rings or rotor magnets came to be called synchronous motors, and direct current motors with commutators came to be called electric motors, although it was understood that this principle was similar to generators
 Works on itself
 jab dianemo or motor aasaani se yantric or vidyut urja ko ek duusare main roopantarit karne lage, inhen rotary conwarter naamak upkaran main sanyukt rup se kaam main liya gaya, yah ek ghurnan karne vaali mashin hoti he, jiskaa uddeshy vidyut shakti kaa utpaadan karnaa nahin hota
 Rather it transforms one type of electric current into another, for example the alternating current into a direct current
 These were multi-field one-rotor devices with two or more sets of rotating contacts, one of which powered one set of armature windings to rotate the equipment and one or more to produce the output current
 Used to be associated with other Waindings
 rotary canwarter sidhe, aantarik rup se, kisi bhi prakaar ke shakti ko duusare prakaar main roopantarit kar saktaa he
 This includes conversion between alternating current and direct current, conversion between three-phase and one-phase power, conversion between 25 Hz AC and 60 Hz AC, or several other different output voltages at the same time
 roter kaa aakaar or bhaar bada tha taaki roter ek fliwheel kaa kaam kar sake or aapurti kii ja rahi shakti main achaanak parivartan aane par bhi nirantar shakti pradaan kar sake
 Typical rotary converters are still used today in the West Id IRT subway in Manhattan
 1960 ke dashak ke ant main or sambhawatah kuch saal baad
inhen 25 hertz asi ke dwaara sanchalit kiya jaataa tha or ye trainon ke liye 600 volt kii disht dhara uplabdh karaate the
 The technology of rotary converters was replaced in the early 20th century by mercury-vapor rectifiers, which were small, did not produce vibrations and noise and required little maintenance
 isi prakaar kaa roopantaran kaary vartmaan main thos avasthaa power ardhchaalak upkarnon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Dynamos are still used today in low-capacity production, particularly where low-voltage direct current is required, since an alternator consisting of a semiconductor rectifier is ineffective in these applications
 haath ke crank vaale dianemo kaa upyog chlokawork radio, haath se chalane vaali flash lit, mobile phone richarger or badariyon ko richarge karne ke liye anya maanav sanchalit upkarnon main kiya jaataa he
