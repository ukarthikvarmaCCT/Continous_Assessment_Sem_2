 The word Aarti can have many meanings - jihad ek arabi shabd he jiskaa shabdic matlab vishesh rup se prashansaneey uddeshy ke saath prayaas karnaa yaa sangharsh karnaa he
 There are many shades of meaning in its Islamic context, such as the struggle against one's evil inclination, the attempt to convert unbelievers, or the moral trust of society, with Islamic scholars generally equating military jihad with defensive warfare

 Two types of Jihad have been described
 ek he jehad al akbar yani bada jehad or doosraa he jehad al asgar yani chota jehad
 The word jihad often appears in the Quran without military connotations, often with the idiomatic expression "striving in the way of God"

 The Gregorian calendar {gregorian calendar} is a calendar used almost everywhere in the world
 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method
 is paddati ko bhinn-bhinn isai deshon main bhinn-bhinn varshon main sweekaar kiya gaya
 From this it is necessary to keep this in mind while reading the history of these countries
 is naveen paddati ko italy, france, spain or portugal ne 1582 i0 main, prashia, germany ke roman catholic pradesh switzraland, holland or flanders ne 1583 i0 main, poland ne 1586 i0 main, hungary ne 1587 i0 main, germany or netherland ke protestant pradesh tathaa denmark ne 1700 i0 main, british samrajya ne 1752 i0 main, japan ne 1972 i0 main china ne 1912 i0 main, bulgaria ne 1915 i0 main, turki or soviet rus ne 1917 i0 main tathaa yugoslavia or romania ne 1919 i0 main apanaaya
 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day

 jean-jacques Rousseau is counted among the earliest thinkers of the West
 kintu antarvirodh tathaa virodhabhaason se purna hone ke kaaran uske darshan kaa swaroop vivaadaaspad rahaa he
 Despite being the product of his era, he opposed the then beliefs, in the era of Buddhism he condemned the intellect (he was opposed to it) and gave utmost importance to innate human emotions
 saamaajik prasanvida kii shabdaawalee kaa avlamban karte hue bhi usne is siddhant kii antaratma main sarvatha naveen arth kaa sannivesh kiya
 While criticizing the social bond and political slavery, he called the state essential for morality
 aarthik asamanta or vyaktigat sampatti ko avaanchhneeya maanate hue bhi ruso samyavaadee nahin tha
 Starting with gross individualism, it results in collectivism

 discorse on di aarigin ov iniquality; 2
 Economical Palitic; 3

 Emili
 prayek vichaarak kaa darshan uske jivan se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 To understand some Rousseau, his characteristic features and weaknesses are particularly known
 apane vyaktitagat dosha ke liye samaaj ko uttaradaayi tehraakar ruso ne na keval apane ko nirparaadh balki manushyamaatr ko nisargat: nek or vishuddhatma bataaya
 Having conceived the artificial environment of the materialistic civilization of Paris, he imagined a simple life of natural state
 shikshit or sabhy samaaj ke saath apane vyaktitv kaa saamanjasy vah kabhi nahin sthapit kar paaya
 The last years of his life were filled with impulses of somatic anguish, mental depression, imaginary fear, disturbance and mania
 baalyavastha se hi vah charitraheen tha
 Despite being a slave to lusts, he lacked lofty feelings
 uski kritiyaan uski sahaj anubhutiyon kii abhivyakti hai
 That is why they are so touching and influential
 aadhunik sabhyataa ke dosha kaa varnan karte hue ruso apane samay ke anya vichaarkon kii bhanti prakritik or rudhigat kaa antar prastut karata he
 But the imagery of the natural state is unnecessary to confirm his state-related views
 ruso ke anusaar prakritik avasthaa main jivan saral tha
 Wisdom and language were not developed
 manushya apni sahaj pravritiyon ke anusaar aacharan karata tha
 That morality was beyond immorality
 use na ham sukhi kah sakate hai, na du:khee
 This condition is not the norm of Rousseau
 vah buddhi tathaa bhaavana kaa saamanjasy chahta he jo prakritik avasthaa ke vikaas kii duusari manzil he
 This is the situation between the simple inactivity of early life and the toxic complexity of scientific suffering
 bhashaa kaa vikaas, saamaajik sahyog, shanti or sauhardra, isaki visheshtaayen hai
 Gradually, the intellect overcomes feelings and trust, faith, love and kindness take the place of unbelief, disharmony, selfishness
 vyaktigat sampatti kaa aavirbhaav hota he or manushya daastaa kii shrunkhlaa main jakad jaataa he
 His person is destroyed due to economic exploitation and social tyranny
 is varnan main france kii rajyakranti ke purv kii avasthaa pratibimbit he
 It is from this situation that social covenant is required to attain salvation
 ruso kii praranmbhik kritiyon tathaa saamaajik prasanvida ke kuch anshon ke avlokan se prathit hota he ki lekhak samaaj vyavastha kaa virdohi he or vyakti kii nirpeksh swatantraaa main vishwaas karata he
 Kitsu Rousseau himself does not condone the extreme individualism of the origin of equality described by critics and the gross collectivism of the "social covenant"
 apni praarambhik kritiyon main uskaa udashy prachlit manyataon kaa khandan maatr tha
 In some social covenants, he presents his independent philosophy
 uske anusaar manushya saamaajik praani he
 Its human qualities can develop in the society itself
 kitu vartmaan samaaj use anaavashyak tathaa anishtakaari bandhanon se jakad detaa he
 The purpose of the covenant is to establish a society that can protect the freedom and property of every member by their entire collective power, and in which each person will join the society and follow his own command and remain independent
 iske liye prayek vyakti apni sampurna shaktiyon ko saamaanya sankalp ke sarvocch nirdesan main samaaj ko saunp detaa he or phir samshti ke avibhajya ansh ke rup main un sabhi adhikaron ko praapt kar letaa he
 The state that originates as a result of covenant is a moral component that has its own independent resolution
 yah saamaanya sankalp jo sadaiv samshti or vyashti donon kii raksha or kalyaan main pravrutt rahata he, samaaj main vidhaan kaa strot tathaa nyaay kaa maandand he
 It is clear that such a society cannot be the result of covenant, because full recognition of covenant is the moral and logical priority of the individual and not the society
 ruso saamaanya sankalp or sabake sankalp main antar bataata he
 Everyone's determination is only the sum of special resolutions, which remains at the level of personal interests only
 saamaanya sankalp sadaiv swarthrahit tathaa saamaanya hit ke liye hota he
 Sometimes Rousseau calls the majority a general resolution
 vah yah bhi kahata he ki paraspar virdohi vichaaron ke takaraane se jo avshesh rahata he vahi saamaanya sankalp he
 But these things are against his basic belief
 saamaajik prasanvida kaa siddhant swatantraaa kaa virodhabhas utpann karata he
 According to Rousseau the general resolution is permanent, indivisible and irrevocable
 vah nity satya he
 The interest of the person is embedded in him
 chunki manushya ko apane hit ke viruddh kaary karne kii swatantraaa nahin ho sakati, isliye jo vyakti saamaanya sankalp kaa virodh karata he vah vastav main atmadrohi he
 Being an embodiment of the general resolution, the state can compel him to be "independent" in the true sense
 dand bhi swatantraaa kaa hi rup he
 Thus this doctrine becomes the fountainhead of totalitarianism in the name of freedom
 ruso swayan adhinayakawad kaa samarthak he, yah kahana thik nahin he, kyonki vah kahata he ki samprabhu samaaj kii maanya prathaon kaa ulanghan nahin kar saktaa
 Personal freedom is necessary for social interest
 rajya ke liye ruso vidhayakon ko aavashyak bataata he
 It is needed because even though the public always wants public welfare, it is not always able to understand it
 vidhayak yaa vyavasthaapak uchit paraamarsh dekar uskaa pathpradarshan karata he
 Rousseau calls parliamentary representation contrary to the general resolution
 vah pratyaksh janatantr ke paksh main he jo keval uski janmabhumi jineva jaise chote rajya main hi sambhav he
 Even considering the possibility of a League of Nations, Russo attaches special importance to the nation state
 jab tak satta janata ke haath main he, sarkaar kaa swaroop gaun he
 Government is only an instrument of public interest
 at: use kisi bhi samay badla ja saktaa he
 Gayarke calls it "the principle of Nityakranti
 ruso sarkaar ke do anshon kii charchaa karata he : vyavasthapika tathaa kaaryakarini
 He calls the administrator superior, because the general resolution is expressed by him
 raajnneetik dal saamaanya sankalp kii abhivyakti main baadhak hote hai
 So Rousseau is against him
 ek samiti arth main dharm ko vah rajya ke liye upyogi bataata he
 For the order of society, the state should specify certain principles of religion and force the public to follow them
 buddhivaadee vyaktvaad evam prakritik vidhaan ruso main kahan tak vidyaman he, yah matbhed kaa vishay he
 But there is no doubt that he transgressed these principles and reinstated the Greek view in modern rajadarshan according to which the collective consciousness of the state is the source of morality and freedom of the individual
 jaisaa arestu ne kaha tha, rajya ke baahar rahanevaala vyakti yaa to pashu he yaa dev
 That is why Rousseau is called the first of modern suffragists, not the last among the covenantalist thinkers
 kaant ne use achaarshastra kaa newton kaha he
 His influence on Hegel and his Anglo followers is obvious
 aadhunik janatantr tathaa rashtrawaad ko usase vishesh prerana mili he

 Breathing is said to be a constant heart rate lower than 60 beats per minute in the context of adult medication, although it is not called a symptom of the disease until it falls below 50 beats per minute
 This may cause some patients to have a heart attack, because people suffering from bradycardia do not have enough oxygen to reach their heart
 kai baar isaki vajah se behoshee, saans lene main pareshaani or zyada gambhir hone par maut bhi ho sakati he

 Such changes are done by the Parliament of India
 inhen sansad ke prayek sadan se paryaapt bahumat ke dwaara anumodan praapt hona chahie or vishisht sanshodhano ko rajyon ke dwaara bhi anumodith kiya janaa chahie
 The details of this procedure are given in article 368, Part XX of the Constitution
 in niyamon ke baavjood 1950 main samvidhan ke lagu hone ke baad se is main 101 sanshodhan kiye ja chuke hai
 Controversially, according to the Supreme Court of India, it is not possible to allow every amendment to be made in the Constitution
 ek sanshodhan is prakaar hona chahie kii yah samvidhan kii "mul saranchana" kaa sammaan kare, jo ki aparivartaneey he
 The proposal for an amendment begins in Parliament where it is introduced as a bill
 iske baad ise sansad ke prayek sadan ke dwaara anumodith kiya janaa chahie
 In each House it should get a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting and a simple majority of all members
 iske baad vishisht sanshodhano ko kam se kam aadhe rajyon kii vidhayikaon ke dwaara bhi anumodith kiya janaa chahie
 Once all other stages are completed, the approval of the President of India is obtained for amendment, but this final phase is only a formality
 samvidhan paryaapt bahumat kii aavashyaktaa ke baavjood, yah duniya main sabase zyada baar sanshodhit kiya jane vaala prashaasak dastavej he; har saal main ausatan do sanshodhan kiye jate hai
 This is partly due to the length and breadth of the constitution
 It is the longest constitution in any of the world than a sovereign nation, with 395 articles and 117000 words
 yah dastavej sarkaar kii shaktiyon ko atyadhik vishisht rup se varnit karata he or isiilie sanshodhano ke liye aksar un maamalon ke saath deal kiya jaataa he, jinhen anya deshon main saamaanya darja diya jaataa he
 The second reason for this is that the Parliament of India is elected by a seat in the district, for this the plurality system used in the United States and the United Nations is used
 iskaa arth yah he ki empi ke samooh ke liye yah sambhav he ki ve do tihaai matdaan hasil kiye bina sansad main do tihaai siten jeet sakate hai

 prayek sanshodhan ko aamtaur par lambaa sheershak diya jaataa he "ek adhinium jo bharat ke samvidhan main sanshodhan karata he"
 The first constitutional amendment was made by the Supreme Court of India in 1967, in the case of Golak Nath Vs State of Punjab
 yah sanshodhan is aadhaar par kiya gaya ki yah anuchhed 13 kaa ulanghan kar rahaa tha, jiske anusaar "rajya koi aisa kanoon nahin banayega jo" main die gaye adhikaron kaa sankshipteekaran karata ho yaa use nasht karata ho
 The term "law" has been interpreted in this article as incorporating amendments to the constitution

 The most important reason for amending the constitution is the deduction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
 ise samvidhan kii anusuchee 9 main moulik adhikaron ke praavdhaan ke vipareet kanoon banaakar praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Schedule 9 protects these laws by keeping such laws open only to limited judicial review
 pratibandh ke praroopik kshetron main sampatti ke adhikaron se sambandhit kanoon shaamil hai, isamen alpsankhyak samoohon jaise "anusuchit jati", "anusuchit janajati" or anya "pichde varg" ke paksh main sakaaratmak karrwai ko bhi shaamil kiya jaataa he
 In a landmark judgment in January 2007, the Supreme Court confirmed that all laws would be open to judicial review if they violated the basic structure of the Constitution
 mukhya nyaayadhish yogesh kumaar sabharwal ne kaha "yadi anusuchee 9 main die gaye kanoon mul adhikaron kaa sankshipteekaran karte hai, yaa unhen radd karte hai to iske parinamswaroop samvidhan kii mul saranchana main ulanghan hoga, aise kanoonon ko avaidh qaraar dena chahie
 LLLKKJJHHYGV The constitution has been amended to promote changes in the Indian territory due to the incorporation of the former French colony of Pondicherry, the former Portuguese colony of Goa into India, and the low exchange with the Pakistani provinces

 saamaajik sanvida kehane se praaia: do arthon kaa bodh hota he
 Firstly, social contract-specific, according to which some persons living in natural state contracted or stayed among themselves to enter into organized society, hence it is the principle of origin of state
 duusarre ko sarkari-sanvida kah sakate hai
 This contract or stagnation has nothing to do with the origin of the state, but by pre-imagining the existence of the state, it discusses the assumptions on which the governance of that state should be managed
 aitihaasik vikaas main sanvida ke in donon roopon kaa taarkik kram saamaajik sanvida kii charchaa baad main shuru hui
 But when all political science began to be discussed on the basis of the contract itself, then both these types of contracts started to be used - social contract for state origin and government contract to regularize its government
 yadhyapi saamaajik sanvida kaa siddhant apane ankur rup main sucraat ke vichaaron, sophist raajnneetik darshan evam roman vidhaan main miltaa he tathaa menegold ne ise janata ke adhikaron ke siddhant se joda, tathaapi iskaa pratham vistrut vivechan madhyayugin raajnneetik darshan main sarkari sanvida ke rup main praapt hota he
 This became the principle of contract as the basis of government
 yah vichaar na keval madhyayugin saamanti samaaj ke swabhavanukool varan madhyayugin isai mathadhishon ke paksh main bhi tha kyonki yah rajkeey satta kii seemayen nirdhaarit karne main sahaayak tha
 Even in the era of religious conflict of the 16th century, this doctrine became the basis for the justification of the opposition of the minorities to the government which accuses the religion of the majority
 is rup main isane kalvinavaad tathaa romanwaad donon alpsankhyakon ke uddeshyon kii purti kii
 But later on, instead of government contract, social contract was received by Hobbs, Locke and Russo
 spashtat: saamaajik sanvida main vishwaas kiye bina sarkari sanvida kii vivechna nahin kii ja sakati, parantu sarkari sanvida par vishwaas kiye bina saamaajik sanvida kaa vivechan avashya sambhav he
 a society created by a social contract can be autonomous, without distinguishing between the ruler and the governed and therefore without the possibility of another contract between them
 yah ruso kaa siddhant tha
 Secondly, a society built on a social contract can appoint a government as protection so that, although it does not enter into a contract, it can elect to violate the rules of the guardian
 yah tha lock kaa siddhant
 Finally, once built on a social contract, society can delegate all its rights and powers to a sovereign sovereign who does not make any contract with the society and is therefore not within the limits of any government contract
 yah habs kaa siddhant tha
 Probably in India, the mighty king and the importance of social contract was first understood
 manusmriti, mahabharat ke shaantiparv tathaa chanakya ke arthshaastra main vyakt vichaar saamaajik sanvida kaa samarthan karte hai
 In the Mahabharata, Bhishma says- saamaajik sanvida ke mahatv ko vyakt karte hue bhishma aage kehete hai ki hamane suna he ki purvakaal main arajak praja ek duusare kaa vaise hi bhakshan karti thi jaise jal main badi machhlee choti machhlee kaa
 Bhishma further says- lekin bhishma kehete hai ki 'dhan-smapda chaahane vaale nar ko chaiye ki vah raja kii puja vaise hi kare jaise indra kii kii jaati he
 The king was considered 'divine'
 isi tarah ke vichaar dighanikaay main aaye hai
 Although the trauma on the principle of social contract started from the time of Hegel itself, it was the first to be most damaged by David Hume
 hum ke anusaar sarkaar kii sthapana sahmati par nahin, abhyaas par hoti he or is prakaar raajnneetik kritagyata kaa aadhaar bataaya tathaa bark ne vikasvaadi siddhant ke aadhaar par sanvida kii aalochana kii
 The principle of social contract is not only unproven from the point of view of historicity but is also faulty from the legal and philosophical point of view
 kisi sanvida ke vaid hone ke liye use rajya kaa sangrakshan evam avlamban praapt hona chahie; saamaajik sanvida ke peeche aisi kisi shakti kaa ullekh nahin
 Therefore it is illegal
 duusare, sanvida ke niyam sanvida karne waalon par hi aropit hote hai, unki santati par nahin
 The philosophical basis of the theory of social contract is also flawed
 yah dharna ki vyakti or rajya kaa sambandh vyakti ke aadhaarit swatantra sankalp par he, satya nahin he
 The state is neither an artificial creation nor its membership is voluntary, because a person can neither get membership at will nor can he renounce
 duusare, yah maanav itihaas ko prakritik tathaa saamaajik do avasthaaon main vibhajit karata he; aise vibhaajan kaa koi taarkik aadhaar nahin he; aaj kii sabhyataa utani hi prakritik samajhi jaati he jitani praarambhik kaal kii thi
 Thirdly, this theory presupposes that a person living in the natural state was aware of the idea of contract but it is not possible to imagine social responsibility for those who are not in the social state
 yadi prakritik vidhaan dwaara shasit koi prakritik avasthaa sweekaar kar lee jaae to aisi sthiti main rajya kii sthapana pragati kii nahin, varan paraavriti kii dyotak hogi, kyonki prakritik vidhaan ke sthaan par bal par aadhaarit rajya satta apnaanaa pratigaman hi hoga
 If the natural state was such that it could provide the idea of contract, then one would have to assume that man was still conscious of the common interest; From this point of view, he should also be conscious of social authority and individual rights
 or tab prakritik or saamaajik avasthaaon main koi antar nahin rah jaataa
 In the end, as Greene said, the major error of this theory is not its antiquity but that the basis in it is imagined by disambiguating them from society
 taarkik dhang par adhikaron kaa aadhaar samaaj kii sahmati he; adhikaar unheen logon ke bich sambhav he jinaki pravritiyaan evam abhilashaayen bauddhik hai
 Therefore, natural rights are not powers but only powers
 parantu in sabhi trutiyon ke hote hue bhi saamaajik sanvida kaa siddhant sarkaar ko sthayitv pradaan karne kaa ek prabal aadhaar he
 This theory establishes the idea that the base of the state is not a force, because the government is based on public consensus
