 During his reign the Chin dynasty increased trade, progressed agriculture and militarily secured its empire
 isamen ek bada qadam jagiradaaron ko hataanaa tha, jinka jhou jamaane main har kisaan mohataaj hota tha
 Due to this, the emperor had direct control over the people of the country, which brought him the ability to do big things

 is se china main jo buddhijiviyon kaa swatantra vaataavaran chal rahaa tha, jise sau vichaardhaaraen kaha jaataa he, samaapt ho gaya
 In spite of Chin's good works among scholars coming from these things, a hatred has also arisen for them
 china main is ghatana ko 'kitaab jalaana or vidwaan dafanaana' kaha jaataa he, jiske liye chini bhashaa main vaakya 'fen shu kang ru' he
 Whenever a dictator wants to crush ideas and intellectuals, this formula is used in Chinese culture

 This is why the delivery price is higher and the consumers pay more
 aa) ucch vigyaapan or sanvardhan laagat - aadhunik vipanan pe baari vigyaapan or sanvardhan laagat kaa bhi aarope lagaaya gaya he
 Marketers respond that advertising products incur costs

 5) Materialism and False Desire - Marketing system has been accused of giving importance to various evils in the society
 aalochak ne bataaya he ki vipanan pranali kaa aagrah bhautikwaad me he or usame zyada ruchi he
 This roundabout is not continuous on subscribers
 6) anuchit pratispardhi prathao - kuch dalo ne dusre dalo ko nasht karne ke iraade se anuchit pratispardhi prathao apanaaya he
 They price their prices down, threaten suppliers to cut merchandise or discourage people from taking on competitor products
 jabaki yah sabit karnaa he ki unka iraadaa shikari he
 'principles of Sustainable Marketing' - 1) graahak unmukhi vipanan - satat vipanan jo yah darshaati he ki dal ko apana drishy or vipanan gatividhiyo upbhoktayo ke drishy se rakhana chaiye

 As the Ganges water and water, the pavement is released

 Begging to eat food, please read Hari Naam

 Taki dharani pativrata, the practice of Ghe Veda

 kahyo sudama balm sunu, vrutha or sab bhoga
 True hymns to God, chanting and jog along with religion
 
 8
 
 lochan-kamal Dukhmochan Tilak Bhal, sravani kundal mukut dhare math hai
 Bejewanti goods in the cluttered yellow basin; sankh chakra gada or padam dhare haath hai
 
 kahat narottam sandipani guru ke paas, You say we are together
 dwarika ke gaye hari darid harange piy, He is the father of the fatherless, the Nath of Dwarika

 The scorpion, the cigarette jug, tiy ! taako kaha ab deti he sichha
 j tapa ki parlok reformat, sampati kii tinke nahin ichha
 
 mere hiye hari ke pad pankaj, Look at thousands of times auran ko dhan chaiye baawari, Infertility funds are only willing
 
 10
 
 Dani bade trun lokan, jag jeevat naam sadaa jinako lai
 Well-known method of Dinan, siddh karau piy mero matau lai
 Do not go to the door of Deendayal or ke dwaar pai deen hvai bole
 Hitu goes to Shri Jadunath, tihunpan kyon can maangat doli
 
 11
 
 kshatrin ke pen juddha juva, It is only the Gajrajan who is ready
 bas ke banij or krisi pen
 Sood is the only one who consumes
 vipran ke pen he ju yahi, There is no reason for happiness kai padhiyo kai tapodhan he, Which mother-in-law is not ashamed 
 12
 
 Kodon a quarter and a half full, na chaahti hon dadhi-doodh mithoti
 Sit Vitiit Bhayo Sisiatihi; hon hathti pai tumhain na pathoti
 Do not earn barley, tumhen kaahe ko dwarika theli pathoti
 Do not go home or sing when you drink! tooto tawa aru phooti kathoti

 Let the wheel rest with the wheel, tahaan bhuule se bhoop kitek ginaaun
 From Dev Gandharva and Kinnar Jachh, sanjh laun thaadhe rahain jihi thaanu

 16
 
 May you enjoy many mistakes, thaadhe rahon timi chakkave baari
 From Dev Gandharva and Kinnar Jachh, melo karain tinaku adhikari

 Phat pat broken, khan khi bhi maang maani, bina yajna vimukh rahat dev titrai
 They are Deenbandhu sad to see how kind they are dai hai kachu jau sau hon jaanat agantai

 You have said good things to me
 yahi reeti mitrai kii nit priti sarasie
 The mind meets the mind, at the intersection, mitra ke jau jeie tau aapahu jenvaiye
 
 ve hai maharaj jori baitht samaaj bhoop, Where can i say this? dukh sukh ke din tau ab kaate hi banaige bhuli, Do not go to the doorway friend of Bipat
 
 20
 
 Known brothers of the world of vipran let sab hi kii sudhi aise mahaadani hai
 Read a chatter where ever you are, lochan apaar vai tumhain na pahichaani hai
 
 ek deenabandhu, kripasindhu keri gurubandhu, You know you as a poor person naam let chauguni, gaye te dwaar sauguni so, Dekhat sahasraguni is the beloved God
 
 21
 
 His love is not missed in love, mo mili hai uthi kanth lagaay kai
 The tortoises that have gone are right, ve dwarika dwarika ju hai sab likai

 22
 
 Hoojai kavadaro times thousand flame, jau hitu deen dayaalu son pie
 Thakur j of Tiihu Lok, tinke darbar na jaat lajaaie
 
 meri kahi jiy main dhari kai pie, Play mistake and context
 or ke dwa son kaaj kaha piy, Follow through Dwarka Nath
 
 23

 Do not say barley, grow sad jaiye kahaan apni gati here

 Mangat khat chale thaan, marag bali-boont

 Dithi was dazzled after seeing Subarnamai, ek te aache ek dwarika ke bhun hai
 Ask Binu Kou, where should i talk to Kahu? devtaa se baithe sab saadhi saadhi maun hai

 The Boyle Gatekeeper is a 'sudama Naam Pandey' Suni, chhande kaaj aise ji kii gati jaanai ko? Dwarika's Nath Hath Jori Dhye Gaye Pyaan, bhete bhari ank laptaay dukh sane ko
 Nain dau pala bhaari ask kusal hari, wipro bolio vipadaa main mohi pahichaanai ko? As you curry, curry is the Indus of Mercy, aisi priti dinabandhu ! dinan son maanai ko?

T
O
 They are brokers, they tell people that you will not have to go there and we will get everything done, you will be given license at your house, mostly this is happening with women in India, although men are not too far behind in this matter
 , But the Ministry of Transport, Government of India has given a lot of strength to the process of granting licenses, according to the department, unless you go and give your paper yourself and come The trial will also be long, did not you Draving license, but it is within all only the Ministry of documents and offices, the Arktikok in In the office where this entire process takes place, all this work is done only by the RTO
 The soldiers do the same, they give you exams, they do the rest of the process
 If you have gone, then remain idolized and sit here, so here too the responsibility of the government comes out
 2) sharaab -:durghatnaon kaa doosraa sabase bada kaaran sharaab pikar gadee chalaanaa, hamaare desh main zyaadaatar driver sharaab ke nashe main gadee chalaate hai uskaa mukhya kaaran unki choubees ghante kii duty hoti hai, unka maananaa hota hai kii agar ham nasha kar lete hai to hamen neend nahin aegi jo kii bilkul galat hota hai, nasha karne ke baad unka sharir to jagaa hua rahata hai lekin nasha karne ke baad byakti kaa dimag apane aap sho jaataa hai or tabhi hadashe ho jaati hai, isamen bhi sarkaar ne bahut acha niyam bana diya hai, sharaab pikar yaa phir nashe main gadee chalaane vaale byakti ko sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya hai lekin yah sajaa zyaadaatar logon ko milti nahin hai kyuu kii pakaden jane par yah police ko kuch na kuch le dekar nikal jate hai, to yahan par laaparvaahee sarkaar kii nikal kar hi ai
 3) Excess of baggage -: One of the main causes of road accidents in India is that two times three to four times more luggage is loaded inside the vehicle than its capacity, due to which those freight vehicles Tires get ripped and accidents happen that cause damage to both goods and persons, ie both people and money, now the question arises that when everyone knows, why do people do this? Q, motor owners or drivers are ready to take the loss of both their lives and goods, the main reasons for it are as follows: 1) Police - The police of our country are responsible here, because most of the cases are not of guards but of eaters
 The way you work, you have to pay for your car, the road through which the city will pass, every turn, every toll, or wherever the police will find you
 If not sing without means police you will bother some time, To avoid this, people give money to the police and drive the vehicle in overloading to match that money, here too the responsible administration is reducing the handriver's salary - from the very first day i have seen this drivers and motor Since i have tried to understand the world, i have seen only one thing that motor owners feel one thing is that the driver has extra income so he has less salary
 Things, owners are thinking less salary and driver equal undergo load then Extra freight train to offset that by selling Whoa your money, which is born due to the accidents
 Here also the responsible administration is the reduction of the handriver's salary - since the very first day i have tried to understand this drivers and motor world, i have seen only one thing that motor owners feel one thing is that the driver They have extra income, so they are paid less, the owners think that they pay less and the driver then loads the extra goods into the car to make up for it
 Te that sell do's equal their money, which are born because of the accidents
 Here also the responsible administration is the reduction of the handriver's salary - since the very first day i have tried to understand this drivers and motor world, i have seen only one thing that motor owners feel one thing is that the driver They have extra income, so they are paid less, the owners think that they pay less and the driver then loads the extra goods into the car to make up for it
 Te that sell do's equal their money, which are born because of the accidents
 4) lacheelee kanoon byavastha -:hamaare desh kaa samvidhan bhale hi likhit taur par duniya kaa sabase bada or adarsh samvidhan hai lekin vastav main yah bahut hi lacheela yaa phir yun kahen to jarjar kanoon hai, hamaare yahan har kisi ko pataa hai kii agar hamaare paas license hai or gadee kaa beemaa hai to kisi ko bhi thok do bhale hi voh bharat kaa raashtrapati hi kyuu na ho koi fark nahin padegaa 7 din ke andar aapako jamaanat mil jaaegi or phir ladate raho mukadmaa aaajeevan or jo baaki kaa nukshan hai voh beemaa company bharegi hi, to kahi bhi driver yaa phir motor maalik ko koi fark hi nahin padataa durghatnaon se voh aaraam se rahete hai or apane pratidin kii hi tarah jivan chalata hai unka fark keval kisi ko padataa hai to usamen us party ko jise kshati pahuchati hai, iske alaava is puure maamle main hamaari duusari party bhi jimmedaar kahi na kahi hoti hai kyuu kii durghatana hone ke baad yah dand ke taur par kaaphi maamalon main paisa lekar maamle ko rafa-dfa kar dete hai or baad main kehete hai kii jisko janaa tha voh to chalaa gaya ab or kya kar sakate hai kam se kam paisa mil rahaa hai yahi thik hai or antat jisane galati kii hai voh bari, azaad ho jaataa hai or jinda maut ban kar sadak par phir se ghoomane lagata hai
 5) Bad roads - One of the major reasons for road accidents in our country is that our roads are overly bad, due to bad roads, i do not mean only potholes on the road, the design of the road is also bad
 It plays an important role in being and the main reason for the deterioration of the roads is the contractual practice, most of the roads in our country or else, every road is not the government, but the people of Rasuk Dar Or they make private companies associated with this department, they get their design approved from the Government of India or they get the design and the contract to build the road and then they start their work
 , They do not mind that the road will run for ten days or fifteen days does not mean that their work is only till they get the money, jagadvandhu sharma, sanskrit ke prasiddh bengali pandit the

 varnan karata he ki Biochemistry, the language structure of science chemistry and the functions of living organisms
 biochemical avadharanaon chikitsa, bhojan, dawa or sookshmjeevigyaani main istemaal kar rahe hai udyog, krishi, saath hi prasanskaran udyog main, kachare kaa upyog karne or krishi ke dwaara utpaadon
 Research Area
 jaev rasayan ke vikaas main kar sakate hai kai charnon or dishaao main vibhajit he
 Types of organic compounds and their composition
 moulik mahatv main paaya carbonic yogicon kii ek suchi kaa sankalan kiya gaya tha rahane vaale jeevon or unamem se prayek kii sanrachana sthapit karne ke liye
 This list includes amino acids, sugars and fatty acids - followed by a more complex compound, followed by more complex - pigment vitamins and coenzymes, and ends up giant molecules of proteins and nucleic acids
 chayapachay maarg
 Apparently, most notable advances in biochemistry associated with the interpretation of the biosynthetic pathways of natural simple compounds, ie compounds from animal dioxide and carbon dioxide from components of animal food
 jeev rasayan pramukh chayapachay maarg vistaar se adhyayan karne main kaamyaab rahe, ek sanshleshan or jaanwaron, paudhon main prakritik yogicon kii daraar pradaan karne, or sookshmjivon 
 Structure and function of molecules
 tisare disha jaev rasayan jaivik kii sanrachana or samaaroh ke bich sambandhon ke vishleshan ke saath jude bade anuon
 So, try to understand what the characteristics of biochemistry structure protein catalysts ie their specificity, manned capacities strictly accelerate the reaction; Polysaccharides that make up cell walls and membranes to demonstrate their complex functions; Casey complex lipids present in nerve tissue, cells involved in neural operation - neurons
 koshikaon ke kaamkaaj
 There is another problem, which engaged biochemistry - the manifestation mechanism of the functioning of specialized cells
 ham, udhaaharan ke liye, nimna sawaalon kaa adhyayan: kaise peshi cell sankuchan ke rup main kuch koshikaon farm, tab hota he haddi kaise utakon ko fefdon se laal rakt koshikaon parivahan oxigen or utakon se carbon dioxide ko waapas lene, koshikaon main varnak sanshleshan ke tantra kya he paudhon, aadi Genetic aspects
 main shuru hua adhyayan he, jo 1940 or sheersh par phir kavak or bacteria par kiya jaataa he, or maanav sahit jeev, aam taur par jin utparivartan se parinaam pataa chalaa he ki koshikaon kuch jaev rasinic pratikriyaaon pravaah karne ke liye sangharsh
 The synthesis of a specific protein led to the concept of genes as an information unit, which is responsible for these observations
 protein ek anzime, or ankoding he to jin utparivartit, cell se baahar le jane ke liye apni kshamta kho detaa he pratikriya, utprerit hota he ki anzime
 The gene - able to replicate a specific segment of the molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid and is capable of synthesizing 


 hattiyaan bala azaad kashmir kaa ek zila he
 Till 1947, it used to be a part of Baramulla district in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 uske baad 2009 tak yah mujaffarabad zile kaa bhaag tha
 The capital of this district is Hattian Bala
 is zile main gurjar or rajput samudaay pramukh hai
 Sudhanoti district has three tehsils - Hattian Bala, Chikar and Lipa
 jaskot-talla dhangu-3, yamakeshwar tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke paudi jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Kim Jong Un is the supreme leader of North Korea
 ve kim jong il ke putr hai
 And is the grandson of Kim Sung
 isane 28 disambar 2011 ko apane aapako taanashaah bana liya or uski aadhikarik ghoshnaa bhi kar di
 All information related to Kim's early life has been found only by the North Korean dictator or by people who have seen him abroad
 jaise ki switzaraland ke vidhyalay main kim ke dwaara padhane kii ghatana
 Kim's birth date to the North Korean department is 8 January 1982, states
 jabaki dakshin korea ke aadhikarik vibhaag ise or baad main he bolta he
 Dennis Rodman stated that he was born on 8 January 1983 and that he met Kim on September 2013
 yah apane teen bhaaiyon main se doosraa he
 According to a report published first in a Japanese newspaper, Kim studied in a school in Switzerland
