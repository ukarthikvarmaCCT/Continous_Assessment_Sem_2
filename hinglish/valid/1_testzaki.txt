 During his reign the Chin dynasty increased trade, progressed agriculture and militarily secured its empire
 isamen ek bada qadam jagiradaaron ko hataanaa tha, jinka jhou jamaane main har kisaan mohataaj hota tha
 Due to this, the emperor had direct control over the people of the country, which brought him the ability to do big things

 is se china main jo buddhijiviyon kaa swatantra vaataavaran chal rahaa tha, jise sau vichaardhaaraen kaha jaataa he, samaapt ho gaya
 In spite of Chin's good works among scholars coming from these things, a hatred has also arisen for them
 china main is ghatana ko 'kitaab jalaana or vidwaan dafanaana' kaha jaataa he, jiske liye chini bhashaa main vaakya 'fen shu kang ru' he
 Whenever a dictator wants to crush ideas and intellectuals, this formula is used in Chinese culture

 Nevertheless, despite a powerful army, the Chin dynasty lasted for a very short time
 jab pehla chin samraat 210 isapurv main mara to uske do mantriyon ne uske bete ko gaddi par yah samajhakar baithaaya ki uske zariye ve swayan raaj karenge
 Despite this intention, the two had a fight, so that both they and the new emperor lost their lives

 He then laid the foundation of the Han dynasty

 The then District Collector of Pune, Walter Charles Rand, as the head of the plague committee persecuted the Indians in Pune

 On June 22, 1897, Damodar Hari Chafekar, Rand and his assistant Lieutenant Eyster were returning from a ceremony
 goli markar hatya kar di
 The Chafekar brothers were residents of a village called Chinchwad near Pune, Maharashtra
 22 june 1897 ko rand ko maut ke ghat utaar kar bharat kii azaadi kii ladaai main pratham krantikari dhamaakaa karne vaale vir damodar pant chaphekar kaa janm 24 june 1869 ko pune ke gram chinchvad main prasiddh kirtankaar haripant chaphekar ke jyeshtha putr ke rup main hua tha
 His two younger brothers were Balkrishna Chafekar and Vasudev Chafekar respectively
 bachapan se hi sainik banane kii ichha damodar pant ke man main thi, viraasat main kirtankaar kaa yash-gyaan mila hi tha
 Maharishi Patwardhan and Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak were his ideals
 tilak ji kii prerana se unhone yuvakon kaa ek sanghathan vyaayaam mandal taiyaar kiya
 He had a feeling of disdain for the British rule since childhood
 damodar pant ne hi bombai main rani victoria ke putale par tarkol pot kar, gale main juuton kii maala pahana kar apana rosh prakat kiya tha
 From 1894, the Chaffekar brothers started organizing Shivaji and Ganpati celebrations every year in Poona
 in samarohon main chaphekar bandhu shiva ji shloke evam ganpati shloke kaa paath karte the
 According to Shiva ji Shloka, freedom cannot be attained just by repeating the story of Shiva ji like a buffalo
 The need is that things should be done with speed like Shivaji and Baji
 Today every good man should hold a sword and shield, knowing that we have to risk life in the national struggle
 We will shed the enemies of the earth who are destroying our religion
 ham to markar mar jaaenge, lekin tum auraton kii tarah fiirf kahaniyaan sunate rahoge

 is sthiti main bhi angrej adhikari janata ko apamaanit tathaa utpeedit karte rahete the
 Walter Charles Rand and Earst - both these British officers were forcibly evacuating people from Pune
 juute pahanakar hi hindua ke pujagharon main ghus jate the
 In this way, these officers considered it their right to torture people instead of helping plague victims
 pune ke hi shri haribhaau chaphekar tathaa shrimati lakshmibai ke teen putr the-damodar hari chaphekar, baalkrishna hari chaphekar or vasudev hari chaphekar
 These three brothers were in contact with Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 teenon bhai tilak ji ko guruvat sammaan dete the
 In the context of any atrocities and injustice, one day Tilak ji said to the Chafekar brothers, "shivaji had opposed the atrocities in his time, but what are you people doing in protest against the British at this time?" After this, these three brothers took the path of revolution
 sankalp liya ki in donon angrejash adhikariyon ko chodenge nahin
 Incidentally the occasion also came when the Diamond Jubilee of the Ascension was to be celebrated on 22 June 1897 at the "government House" in Pune on the occasion of Queen Victoria's suzerainty
 isamen walter charles rand or airst bhi shaamil hue
 Damodar Hari Chafekar and his brother Balkrishna Hari Chafekar also reached there with a friend Vinayak Ranade and both of them started waiting for the British officers to leave
 raat 12 bajkar, 10 minute par rand or airst nikle or apni-apni buggy par savaar hokar chal pade
 As per the plan, Damodar Hari Chafekar climbed behind the Rand's cart and shot him, while Balakrishna Hari Chafekar also shot at Aryast
 airst to turant mar gaya, kintu rand teen din baad aspataal main chal basaa
 The oppressed people of Pune woke up to the chafekar-brothers
 guptchar adheekshak bruin ne ghoshnaa kii ki in faraar logon ko giraftaar karaane vaale ko 20 hajaar rupye kaa puraskaar diya jayega
 There were two Dravid brothers in the Chafekar brothers club - Ganesh Shankar Dravid and Ramchandra Dravid
 in donon ne puraskaar ke lobh main aakar adheekshak bruin ko chaphekar bandhuon kaa suraag de diya
 After this, Damodar Hari Chafekar was caught, but Balakrishna Hari Chafekar was not caught by the police
 satr nyaayadhish ne damodar hari chaphekar ko faansee kii sajaa di or unhone mand muskaan ke saath yah sajaa suni
 At the jail, Tilak ji met him and gave him "geeta"
 18 april 1898 ko praat: vahi "gita' padhate hue damodar hari chaphekar faanseeghar pahunche or faansee ke takhte par latak gaye
 Even at that moment she was in his hands "geeta"
 inkaa janm 25 june 1869 ko pune jile ke chinyakad naamak sthaan par hua tha
 On the other hand, when Balakrishna Chafekar heard that the police were persecuting his relatives by not arresting him, he himself appeared in the police station
 anantar tisare bhai vasudev chaphekar ne apane saathi mahadev govind vinayak rande ko saath lekar un gaddaar dravid-bandhuon ko ja gheraa or unhen goli maar di
 It was the night of 8 February 1899
 anantar vasudev chaphekar ko 8 may ko or baalkrishna chaphekar ko 12 may 1899 ko yarvada karagrih main faansee de di gai
 Balakrishna Chafekar was born in 1863 and Vasudev Chafekar in 1880
 inke saathi krantivir mahadev govind vinayak rande ko 10 may 1899 ko yarvada karagrih main hi faansee di gai
 The "shivaji Mahotsav" and "ganapathi-mahotsav" promoted by Tilak ji made these four youths to go through the path of revolution to do something for the country
 unhone british raaj ke aattaayi va atyaachaari angrej adhikariyon ko bataa diya gaya ki ham angrejon ko apane desh kaa shaasha kabhi nahin sweekaar karte or ham tumhen goli maarna apana dharm samajhate hai
 Thus, he never sought any redemption from the country or society for his charity
 ve mahaan balidani kabhi yah kalpana nahin kar sakate the ki yah desh aise gaddaaron se bhar jayega, jo bharatmata kii vandana karne se inkaar karenge

 In the 18th century, its propaganda actually became widespread
 us samay vastron ko kshareey draavon main kai dinon tak duubaakar dhote or ghaas par kai saptaah sukhaate the
 After this, after washing the clothes for several days, they were washed and cleaned
 viranjan vyavsaay kii sthapana vastut: 1787 i
 main hui
 By then, chlorine had been invented and proved to be very effective in bleaching textiles
 betaule pehle vaigyanik the, jinhone spasht rup se ghoshit kiya tha ki vastron ke viranjan main chlorine gas kaa upyog ho saktaa he or iskaa ullekh unhone apane ek niabandh main kiya tha, jo 'jarnal da fizic' main 1786 i
 main chapa tha
 Then it started being used in many countries

 Due to this, some progress could not be made in its usage
 peeche dekha gaya ki chlorine ko daahak potash main avashoshit karke upyog karne par bhi viranjan ho saktaa he
 Then bleaching powder was prepared by absorbing chlorine in lime, which has been in use till date

 For bleaching the cotton yarn, the cotton is boiled with three to four percent soda ash, or two percent burning soda, at low pressure for six to eight hours
 phir use dhokar viranjan drav ke saath aadhe se do ghante tak upachaarit karte hai
 It is then washed with water and dipped in hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid and washed thoroughly
 yadi soot ko bilkul safed bananaa he, to usko sabun ke durbal vilyan main nilambit kar kuch rang lete hai
 Boiling removes most of the cotton residue

 There have been many efforts to reduce the time and expense spent in bleaching, but they have not yet achieved much success
 yadi adhik prabal viranjan prayukt kiye jaaen, to reshon ke kshatigrast ho jane kii ashanka rahati he or unki chamak bhi bahut kuch nasht ho jaati he

 It is to be immersed in the solution
 jute ke reshon yaa vastron kaa viranjan bhi rooyee yaa sanai ke reshon or vastron ke samaan hi hota he
 Do not use alkali only with them
 inhen keval sodium hypochlorite se upachaarit kar amla se dho daalate hai
 Bleaching of the straw is done by immersing the hydrogen peroxide solution for 12 hours to several days, then by the action of sulfuric acid
 oon ke saamaanon kaa viranjan karne se ve utane shwet nahin hote jitna rooyee yaa linen ke saamaan hote hai, par yadi unka upachaar salfuras amla yaa hydrogen paroxide se kiya jaae, to unka rup bahut kuch sudhar jaataa he
 After treatment, the yarn is washed and hung
 phir bhigaaya jaataa he or alp nila rang dekar ekkaksh ke vilyan main le jaaya jaataa he, jahaan sulfur dioxide banataa he
 Let the goods stay there overnight
 isi reeti se jautav romon yaa koochon ko bhi viranjit karte hai
 By immersing some strong solution of sodium bisulfite, wool is also bleached
 aise viranjit oon ko sabun se dhone par rang phir laut aata he
 If bleached with hydrogen peroxide and back alkaline with ammonia or sodium silicate, the bleaching is permanent
 kaale yaa bhure oon ko viranjan se bilkul safed to nahin banaaya ja saktaa, par unhen sunaharaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Due to the presence of sericin, or silk gum, on top of natural silk, it is slow to see
 sericine 19-25 pratishat tak rah saktaa he
 To remove sericin, 30 percent weight of soap is washed in water and the silk is heated in boiling point at a low temperature for about 3 hours
 isse sericine ghulkar nikal jaataa he or reshe par vishesh chamak aa jaati he
 Now, wash the silk with a mild soda solution and take it to the desired color
 ek vishesh prakaar ke resham, tusar ke viranjan ke liye, hydrogen paroxide kaa upyog hota he

 Mahanadi's name was Chitrotopala in ancient times
 mahananda evam neelotpala bhi mahanadi ke hi naam hai
 Mahanadi originates from a mountain range called Sihawa, located in Dhamtari district near Raipur
 mahanadi kaa pravaah dakshin se uttar kii taraf he
 It has assumed a vast form by the time it receives the water of the rivers Pari and Sodhul in Rajim, leaving Sihawa
 aitihaasik nagari aarang or uske baad sirpur main vah viksit hokar shivarinarayan main apane naam ke anurup mahanadi ban jaati he
 The stream of Mahanadi turns from this religious site and instead of south to north it starts flowing in the east direction
 sambalpur main jile main pravesh lekar mahanadi chhattisgarh se bidaa le leti he
 She spends more than half of her entire journey in Chhattisgarh
 sihava se nikalakar bengal kii khadi main girane tak mahanadi lagbhag 855 kimi kii duuri tay karti he
 On the banks of Mahanadi in Chhattisgarh, there are places like Dhamtari, Kanker, Charama, Rajim, Champaran, Arang, Sirpur, Shivri Narayan and Sambalpur, Balangir, Cuttack etc
 in Orissa and Mahanadi Pari, Sondhur, Shivnath, Hasdev, Arpa, Jonk, Tel etc
 The major tributaries are mahanadi kaa delta katak nagar se lagbhag saat mile pehle se shuru hota he
 From here it divides into several streams and joins the Bay of Bengal
 is par bane pramukh band hai- rudri, gangarel tathaa hirakund
 This river also determines the boundaries of eastern Madhya Pradesh and Orissa
 atyant pracheen hone ke kaaran mahanadi kaa itihaas puraana shrenee kaa he
 According to historical texts, the Mahanadi and its tributaries originated from the ancient Shuklmat Mountains
 iskaa pracheen naam mandvahini bhi tha aisa ullekh na keval itihaaskaar hi nahin balki bhugolvid bhi karte hai
 In connection with Mahanadi, there is a description in the Bhishma festival which states that the Indian subjects used to drink water from Chitrotopala
 arthath mahabharat kaal main mahanadi ke tat par aaryo kaa nivas tha
 Even in the Ramayana period, the kings of the former Ikshvaku dynasty established their kingdom on the banks of the Mahanadi
 muchkund, dandak, kalmampaad, bhaanumant aadi kaa shashan pracheen dakshin kosal main tha
 The valley of Mahanadi has its own distinct civilization
 is aitihaasik nadi ke taton se shuru hui yah sabhyataa dhire dhire nagaron tak pahaunchi
 The Mahanadi originates from a mountain range called Sihawa in Dhamtari district
 mahanadi kaa pravaah dakshin se uttar kii taraf he
 It flows according to the nature of the slope of the terrain corresponding to the flow system, hence a self-contained stream
 pradesh kii seemaant ucch bhoomi se nikalne vaali mahanadi kii anya sahaayak nadiyaan kendriya maidan kii ore pravaahit hoti hui mahanadi se samakon par milakar jal sanchay karti hai
 In terms of the water efficiency of the rivers, it is second after the Godavari river
 chhattisgarh main 286 kimi kii yatra ke is padaav main mahanadi seemaant sidhiyon se utarate samay choti-choti nadiyaan prapaat bhi banaati hai
 Mahanadi has many tributaries
 shivnath nadi chhattisgarh kii duusari sabase badi nahi he jo mahanadi main shivarinarayan main milti he
 The Pari River is another tributary that joins the Mahanadi in the Rajim region as soon as it originates from Vrindanakgarh Zamindari
 iske atirikt khaarun tathaa arapa nadiyaan bhi shivnath nadi main samahit hokar mahanadi kii vishaal jalarashi kaa hissaa banati hai
 Mahanadi is respected like Prayag in Rajim
 hajaaron log yahan snaan karne pahonchte hai
 Shivrinarayan also has the story of Lord Jagannath
 ganga ke samaan pavitra hone ke kaaran mahanadi ke tat par anek dharmik, saanskrithik or lalit kala ke centre sthit hai
 Sirpur, Rajim, Malhar, Kharod, Shivrinarayan, Chandrapur and Sambalpur are the major cities
 sirpur main gandheshwar, rudri main rudreshwar, rajim main rajeev lochan or kuleshwar, malhaar pataleshwar, kharud main lakshmaneshwar, shivarinarayan main bhagwaan narayan, chandrachud mahadev, maheshwar mahadev, annapurna devi, lakshminarayan, shriramalakshmanajanaki or jagannatha, balbhadra or subhadra kaa bhavy mandir he
 There is evidence of Guru Ghasidas's back in Girudpuri and Balmiki Ashram, the birth place of Luv Kush in Turturiya
 isi prakaar chandrapur main maa chandraseni or sambalpur main samaleshwari devi kaa varchasv he
 For this reason, in Chhattisgarh, they are considered as holy and salvation like Kashi and Prayag
 shivarinarayan main bhagwaan narayan ke charan ko sparsh karti hui rohinee kunda he jiske darshan or jal kaa aachman karne se moksh kii prapti hoti he
 The well-known ancient litterateur Pandit Malikram Bhogaha describes it as saying that taking a bath in this river gives freedom from all sins
 ek samay main mahanadi avaagaman kaa saadhan ban jaati thi
 People traveled through the Mahanadi by boat
 vyapaarik drushti se bhi yah yatra upyogi thi
 Historians mention that earlier there was import and export of goods from the waterways of this river to Calcutta
 chhattisgarh ke utpann hone vaali anek vastuon ko mahanadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke maarg ke samudr-tat ke bazaaron tak bheja jaataa tha
 Boats ran on the Mahanadi from July to February
 aaj bhi anek kshetron main log mahanadi main naav se is paar se us paar yaa choti-moti yatra karte hai
 Facts of diamond found in and around the Mahanadi coast have also been found
 gibson naamak ek angrez vidwaan ne apni report main iskaa ullekh bhi kiya he
 According to him, near Sambalpur, Hirakud means a small island called Hirakud
 yahan hira mila karata tha
 These diamonds were widely consumed in Rome
 mahanadi main rome ke sikke ke paye jane ko ve is tathy se jodate hai
 Whensang also wrote in his visit that people used to sell diamonds in Kalinga from Madhya Pradesh, it was Sambalpur in Madhya Pradesh
 ali european trevuers in nagpur terrytory naamak british ricard jo san 1766 kaa he main ullekh he ki ek angrez ko is baat ke liye bheja gaya tha ki vah sambalpur jaakar vahaan heere ke vyapaar kii sambhaavnaaon kaa pataa lagaaye
 Hirakud Dam is also built by damming this Mahanadi
 mahanadi ne chhattisgarh main sarvaadhik nadi-sabhyataa ko janm diya he
 Sirpur, the ancient capital of Chhattisgarh, is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi
 mahanadi kii ghati kii apni vishisht sabhyataa he jo itihaas main darj he
 The Mahanadi and its tributaries are as rich in glory as the Indus and its tributaries of Punjab
 mahanadi kii vishalata or iske mahatv ko dekhakar ise mahanadi kii oopaadhi di gayi he
 In Bhishma festival of Mahabharata, Chitrotopala river has been praised as Punyadayini and Sin Vashishini
 someshvaradev ke mahuda tamrapatr main mahanadi ko chitrotpala-ganga kaha gaya he
 It is believed that Mahanadi is called Ganga that Shringi Rishi's ashram in Tretayug was in the hill of Sihawa
 ve ayodhya main maharaja dasharath ke nivedan par putreshthi yajna karakar laute the
 His kamandal had the holy water of Ganga used in the yajna
 samadhi se uthte samay kamandal kaa abhimantrit jal gir padaa or bahakar mahanadi ke udgam main mil gaya
 With the meeting of Ganga water, Mahanadi became holy like Ganga

 isiilie behad swaabhaavik tha ki meerut se vidroh kar jo sainik dilli pahunche unhone sabase pehle bahadur shah jafar ko apana badshaah banaaya
 Chaturvedi said in conversation that making Zafar the emperor was a message to the British rulers symbolically
 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order
 balki akbar ne apane shasankaal main isi tarah kaa aadesh de rakhaa tha
 Zafar had merely started following this order again
