 To maintain the quality of agricultural education and training, computerization and internet facilities of various institutions have been provided
 krishi utpaadan main sudharutpaadan tathaa utpaadakta main vruddhi The biggest advantage of the Green Revolution or the new development method implemented in Indian agriculture was that the area of crops in the country increased, agricultural production and productivity increased
 visheshkar gehun, bajra, dhan, makka tathaa jowar ke utpaadan main aashaatheet vruddhi hui
 As a result, India became self-sufficient in food grains
 1951-1952 main desh main khadyannon kaa kul utpaadan 5
09 karod ton tha, jo kramshah badhkar 2008-2009 main badhkar 23
38 karod ton ho gaya
 Similarly there has been a substantial improvement in productivity per hectare
 varsh 1950-1951 main khadyannon kaa utpaadan 522 kigra prati hectares tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 1,893 kigra prati hectares ho gaya
 Yes, there has also been some exaggeration in food grains production in India due to bad weather etc
 which proves that agricultural production in the country still depends on the weather
 krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan As a result of the Green Revolution, the traditional form of farming has changed and farming has started to be done commercially
 jabaki pehle sirf pet bharne ke liye kii jaati thi
 There has been an increase in the production of sugarcane, cotton, jute and oilseeds in the country
 kapaas kaa utpaadan 1960-1961 main 5
6 million ganth tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 27 million ganth ho gaya
 Similarly, the production of oilseeds was 7 million tonnes in 1960–1961, which increased to 28
2 million tonnes in 2008–2009
 isi tarah patson, ganna, aalu tathaa moongfalee aadi vyavsaayik fasalon ke utpaadan main bhi vruddhi hui he
 At present, cultivation of horticultural crops, fruits, vegetables and flowers is also being encouraged in the country

 Which can be used in the development work of the country
 agragami tathaa pratigaami sambandhon main majbootee New technology and modernization of agriculture have made the relationship between agriculture and industry stronger
 parmparik rup main yadhyapi krishi or udyog kaa agragami sambandh pehle se hi pragadh tha, kyonki krishi kshetra dwaara udyogon ko anek aagat uplabdh karaaye jate hai
 But the regressive relationship between these two was very weak, because the manufactured goods of the industry were rarely used in agriculture
 parantu krishi ke aadhunikaran ke falswaroop ab krishi main udyog nirmit aagton, jaise- krishi yantra evam rasinic urvarak aadi, kii maang main baari vruddhi hui he, jisase krishi kaa pratigaami sambandh bhi sudrudh hua he
 In other words, the relationship between agriculture and industrial sector has become stronger
 is tarah spasht he ki harith kranti ke falswaroop desh main krishi aagton evam utpaadan main paryaapt sudhaar hua he
 As a result, farmers, government and public have become convinced that India can not only become self-sufficient in the field of agricultural produce, but can also export
 vishleshan There has been substantial development in the field of agriculture in the planning period in the country
 kul krishi kshetra badha he, fasal ke swaroop main parivartan hua he, sinchit kshetra badha he, rasinic khaadon ke upyog main vruddhi hui he tathaa aadhunik krishi yantron kaa upyog hone laga he
 Despite all these things, the development of agriculture in the country has not yet reached the proper level, because the agricultural production per hectare is less than other developed countries
 abhi anek krishi utpaadon kaa aayaat karnaa padhata he
 Because their production is less than the demand
 krishi kshetra kaa abhi bhi ek badha bhaag acinchit he
 The level of mechanization in agriculture is still low, leading to higher production costs
 krishakon ko vibhageeya suvidhaayen paryaapt maatra main nahin milti hai, jisase krishi vikaas main baadha utpann hoti he
 Therefore, there is a need for further development of the agricultural sector by implementing technical and institutional reforms in agriculture more effectively
 harith kranti kaa vistaar In the first component of the action plan made for the development of the agriculture sector in the Union Budget 2010-2011, with the active cooperation of Gram Sabhas and farmer families, the expansion of Green Revolution in the eastern region of the country Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa
 a provision of Rs 400 crore has been made for this
 kamiyaan tathaa samasyaayen As a result of the Green Revolution in the country, there has been a substantial increase in the production of some crops, there has been a decrease in the import of food grains, there has been a change in the traditional form of agriculture, yet some shortcomings are reflected in this program
 harith kranti kii pramukh kamiyon evam samansyaon ko nimna rup main pranstut kiya ja saktaa he- Impact - The impact of the Green Revolution was limited to certain crops, such as wheat, jowar, millet
 anya fasalo par iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padaa he
 Even rice has been affected very little by this
 vyapaarik fasalen bhi isse aprabhavit hi hai
 Promotion of capitalist agriculture - Seeds of more fertile variety are a capital-intensive program, in which large amounts have to be invested on inputs such as fertilizers, irrigation, agricultural implements etc
 baari nivesh karnaa chote tathaa madhyam shrenee ke kisaanon kii kshamta se baahar hai
 In this way, those farmers who have private pumping sets, tractors, tube wells and other agricultural machines are benefiting from the Green Revolution
 yah suvidha desh ke bade kisaanon ko hi uplabdh he
 Ordinary farmers are deprived of these facilities
 sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa par bal nahin - nai vikaas vidhi main sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa kii sarvatha avhelnaa kii gayi he
 Under institutional changes, the most important component is the system of land holding
 isaki sahaayta se hi takneekee parivartan dwaara adhiktam utpaadan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Land reform programs have not been successful in the country and even today, certainty of landholding has not been provided to millions of farmers
 shram-visthaapan kii samasya - harith kranti ke antargat prayukt krishi yantrikaran ke falswaroop shram-visthaapan ko badhaava mila he
 It is also a reason for the rural population to migrate to cities in search of employment
 aay kii badhati asamanta - krishi main takneekee parivartanon kaa gramin kshetron main aay-vitaran par vipareet prabhaav padaa he

 According to V
 Rao, "it is now well known that inequality in rural income has increased with the so-called Green Revolution, which has helped to increase the production of food grains in the country, many small farmers have to give up their tenancy rights and Social and economic tensions have increased in rural areas
 " Lack of necessary facilities - Due to lack of facilities necessary for the success of Green Revolution, such as irrigation system, agricultural credit, economic holdings and cheap inputs etc
, the desired success in the field of agricultural development is not being achieved
 kshetreey asantulan - harith kranti kaa prabhaav punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, maharashtra tathaa tamilnadu aadi rajyon tak hi simit he

 Acharya Vishwanath Prasad has described the defect in the literature as saying "rasapakarshaka Dosh:"

 Digital cameras use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as charge device coupled or complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology
 The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be done on paper or film

 The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated
 The camera is small enough to be photographed in an entire room where the object is illuminated properly, while in another room that is kept dark, it can be very large
 badi film main nakaaratmak kaa prayog kiya gaya he, jab is flats kii nakal kii prajnan photography ke liye aam tha
 As soon as the photographic material became candid or tricky enough to take pictures "fast", small "spy" cameras hidden behind some one were actually disguised as a book or handbag or pocket watch, or even worn The lens was actually the Ascot necktie with a tie pin
 The film camera takes a fast sequence of photographs on strips of film which is a type of photographic camera

 Focus position of adjustment of the object or an optical device required in the same to produce a clear image:
 In focus, out of focus, the aperture adjustment of the measured lens opening, as the F-number controls the amount of light passing through the lens
 Aperture also has an effect on the depth of field and diffraction - higher f number, smaller opening, less light, greater depth of field, and greater diffraction blur
 The focal length divided by the f-number gives the effective aperture diameter

 To translate the amount of light into a usable aperture and shutter speed, the meter light needs to be adjusted to the sensitivity of the film or sensor
 is meter main " film kii gati " yaa iesao samvedansheeltaa setting ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 ISO speeds are used on traditional film cameras to "tell the camera" the speed of the selected film film, ISO speeds are employed on modern digital cameras and an automatic exposure as an indication of the system's benefits from light to numerical output To control the system
 The film with a lower ISO number is more sensitive to light, while the higher the ISO number the greater the film sensitivity to light

 Just as a normal circuit is constructed by adding different components, the IC is not constructed by making all the components within a semiconductor follow a specific process simultaneously
 ekikrut paripath aajkal jivan ke har kshetra main upyog main laaye ja rahe hai
 Due to these, the size of electronic devices has become very small, their working capacity has become very high and their power requirement has been reduced

 These individuals were Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce, co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation
 dono hi vidyut ejeeniyar the or dono hi is baat kaa hal nikaalane main jute hue the ki anekanek sankhyaon vaale paripathon ko kaise vishwasaneey rup se nirmit kiya jaay or unka aakaar kaise chota kiya jaay
 Today we can say that if the transistor had not been invented, it would not have been incompatible; And if it were not integrated, there would not be computers and other electronic devices whose circuit is made up of billions of components
 ekipari ke vikaas se nimnlikhit laabh hote hai- Integrated circuits are divided into three parts based on the nature of the circuit inside them - digital ekikrut paripathon ko unamem prayukt transistoron kii sakhya ke aadhaar par small scale integrated, medium scale integrated, large scale integrated, veri large scale integrated, ultra large scale integrated aadi main baanta jaataa he
 In the initial days there were only a few transistors inside the IC

 abujh maadiya abujhamaad ke pahari kshetron main nivas karte he or baisan horn maadiya indravati nadi se lage huye maidani jangalo main
 Bison horn madia is called by this name, because they wear the crown of Baisan ie Gaur horn when dancing in ghotools and special occasions

 The culture of both the tribes is very similar
 ye dono hi bahari logon se milanaa julna pasand nahin karte lekin dono main abujh maadiya zyada akramak hai, ve bahari logon ke apane ilaake main aane par tir-kaman se hamalaa karnaa nahin chookte
 While the Bison Horn Madia mostly like to run in the woods when outsiders come
 maadiya log behad khushmijaaj sharaab ke shaukeen or masamutiyaa hote he
 'masmutiya' is the local word of Chhattisgarh which means to be angry like a child quickly and then to forget it immediately
 maadiya kaksaar naam ke kul devtaa kii aradhana karte hai
 For good harvest, they perform magnificent dances in honor of their deity

 They are very skilled hunters and have great courage
 hamalaa hone par yah baagh junglee bhise yaa bhaaluu se loha lene main nahin hichakate
 They highly respect the tiger and never hunt tigers unnecessarily
 yadi koi baagh kaa shikaar karne ke iraade se inke ilaake main jaay to maadiya use jinda nahin chhodte
 The people of Madiya are ready to fulfill their promise

 iske baad ladkiyaan ladakon ke bal savanrati he or hatho kii maalish karke unhe tarotaaja karti he
 After that everyone dances outside the ghotul

 The lyrics of a song sung at the time of dance are like this - jaisaa ki is geet se spasht he maadiya janajaati main vivaah ke liye ladki kii keemat adaa kerani padati he keemat naa de paane kii sthiti main ladke ko ladki ke pita ke ghar kuch samay tak kaam karnaa padataa he yah avadhi teen se saat varsh tak kii ho sakati he
 In the event of such marriage, the couple is not allowed to make physical relations in the first year of service, but if the girl agrees, then the bond is removed
 maadiya logon main vivaah hi jivan kaa sabase bada kharch hota he
 To get married, both the parties sit and decide the price
 or var paksh ko yah keemat chukaani hoti he
 Madiya people are allowed to have sexual relations with single young girls
 ghotul main badi umr ke yuvak yuvatiyaan choti umr ke yuvak yuvatiyon ko shaareerik shiksha kii sikh dete hai
 Here, once the marriage is mutually agreed, the young women have to tell the family members to get married
 unke raji naa hone par aksar ve jangal bhaag jate hai
 But even in such a marriage one has to pay the price
 abujhmadiya ghotul main ladkiyaan raat main nahin soti, lekin ladke raat main ghotul main hi rukate hai
 But in Bison Horn Madia, they spend the night in Ghotul
 maadiya mahilayen apane pati ke saath khaat par nahin soti or kisi umr se bade purush ke ghar par hone par vah khaat par nahin baithti
 If Madia is taken away by a tiger, they consider her a divine wrath
 khaskar ise patni ke avaidh sambandh se joda jaataa he
 If the tiger also takes another animal of the same madia in a short time, then he starts keeping a close watch on his wife
 maadiya samaaj main aniatik sambandhu ko bilkul bardaasht nahin kiya jaataa
 But if the woman is not happy with her husband, then she can choose a second husband without any opposition, provided that the person pays the price of the marriage spent on the first wife
 maadiya jati main bahuvivaah kii ijaajat bhi he, lekin vivaah main aane vaale baari kharch ke kaaran aisa yada kada hi hota he
 Widow marriage is also allowed in these
 maadiya janajati main maut ke baad aam taur par kabr main dafanaaya jaataa he, lekin kuch maamalon main shav ko jalaayaa bhi jaataa he
 This age depends on the cause of death and disease etc
 bacchon ko mahua ke ped ke neeche dafanaaya jaataa he, aisa mana jaataa he ki mahua ke ped se ras paakar uski aatma trupt ho jaayegi

 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was the first Vice President and Second President of India
 ve bhartiya samskruti ke samvahak, prakhyat shikshavid, mahaan darshanik or ek aasthavan hindu vichaarak the
 Due to his qualities, the Government of India honored him with the highest honor Bharat Ratna in 1954
 unka janmdin bharat main shikshak diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was born on 5 September 1888 in Tirutani village, Tamil Nadu, which is about 64 km from the then Madras
 jis parivaar main unhone janm liya vah ek brahman parivaar tha
 His place of birth has also been noted as a holy pilgrimage place
 radhakrishnan ke purakhe pehle kabhi 'sarvapalli' naamak gram main rahete the or 18veen shatabdi ke madhya main unhone tirutani gram kii ore nishkraman kiya tha
 But his ancestors wanted that there should always be a realization of the village of his birthplace along with his name
 isi kaaran unke parijan apane naam ke purv 'sarvapalli' dhaaran karne lage the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was a child of a poor but learned Brahmin
 unke pita kaa naam 'sarvapalli veeraswami' or mata kaa naam 'sitamma' tha
 His father worked in the revenue department
 un par bahut bade parivaar ke bharan-poshan kaa daayitv tha
 Veeraswamy had five sons and a daughter
 radhakrishnan kaa sthaan in santatiyon main doosraa tha
 His father was discharging the family with great difficulty
 is kaaran balak radhakrishnan ko bachapan main koi vishesh sukh praapt nahin hua
 Radhakrishnan's childhood was spent in religious places like Tirutani and Tirupati
 unhone pratham aath varsh tirutani main hi gujaarey
 Although his father was old-minded and had religious sentiments, he sent Radhakrishnan to study at the Christian missionary institution Lutheran Mission School, Tirupati between 1896–1900
 phir agle 4 varsh kii unki shiksha vellore main hui
 He then studied at Madras Christian College, Madras
 vah bachapan se hi medhaavi the
 During these 12 years of study, Radhakrishnan also remembered important portions of the Bible
 iske liye unhen vishisht yogyata kaa sammaan pradaan kiya gaya
 At this age, he also studied Veer Savarkar and Swami Vivekananda
 unhone 1902 main metric str kii pariksha uteern kii or unhen chaatravrutti bhi praapt hui
 After this he passed the Faculty of Arts examination in first class in 1904
 unhen manovigyaan, itihaas or ganit vishay main vishesh yogyata kii tippanee bhi ucch praptankon ke kaaran mili
 Apart from this, Christian College, Madras also gave him a scholarship
 darshanashastra main em0e0 karne ke pashchaat 1916 main ve madras residency college main darshanashastra ke sahaayak praadhyaapak niyukt hue
 Later he was also a professor in the same college
 dow radhakrishnan ne apane lekhon or bhaashanon ke madhyam se vishwa ko bhartiya darshan shaastra se parichit karaayaa
 His articles were praised all over the world
 us samay madras ke brahman pariwaron main kam umr main hi shaadi sampann ho jaati thi or radhakrishnan bhi uske apwaad nahin rahe
 In 1903, at the age of 16, he was married to Sivakamu, the sister of a distant relationship
 us samay unki patni kii aayu maatr 10 varsh kii thi
 So, after three years, his wife started living with him
 yadhyapi unki patni sivaakamu ne paramparaagat rup se shiksha praapt nahin kii thi, lekin unka telegu bhashaa par acha adhikaar tha
 She could also write and read English
 1908 main radhakrishnan dampati ko santaan ke rup main putree kii prapti hui
 In 1908, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the first class and got special qualification in philosophy
 shaadi ke 6 varsh baad hi 1909 main unhone kala main snatakottar pariksha bhi uteern kar lee
 The subject of his philosophy was philosophy
 ucch adhyayan ke dauraan vah apni nijee aamadani ke liye bacchon ko tution padhaane kaa kaam bhi karte rahe
 In 1908 he also wrote a research article to obtain the title of MA
 is samay unki aayu maatr bees varsh kii thi
 This increased his knowledge of the scriptures
 sheeghra hi unhone vedon or upanishdon kaa bhi gahan adhyayan kar liya
 Apart from this, he also studied Hindi and Sanskrit language very interestingly
 shiksha kaa prabhaav jahaan prayek vyakti par nishchit rup se padataa he, vahiin shaikshik santhaan kii gunvattta bhi apana prabhaav chhodti he
 At that time Western values of life were deeply instilled within the students by Christian institutions
 yahi kaaran he ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon main adhyayan karte hue radhakrishnan ke jivan main ucch gun samahit ho gayi
 But there was also another change in them which was due to Christian institutions
 kuch log hindutvvaadi vichaaron ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unki aalochana karte the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan took his criticism as a challenge and started to study Hindu scriptures deeply
 dow radhakrishnan yah jaananaa chaahate the ki vastutah kis samskruti ke vichaaron main chetanta he or kis samskruti ke vichaaron main jadta he? tab swaabhaavik antarpragna dwaara is baat par dridhtaa se vishwaas karnaa armbh kar diya ki bharat ke duurastha sthanon par rahane vaale garib tathaa anpadh vyakti bhi pracheen satya ko jaanate the
 For this reason Radhakrishnan came to know comparatively that Indian spirituality is very rich and criticisms of Hinduism by Christian missionaries are baseless
 isse inhone yah nishkarsh nikaala ki bhartiya samskruti dharm, gyaan or satya par aadhaarit he jo praani ko jivan kaa sachcha sandesh detii he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan had well known that life is very short but the happiness prevailing in it is uncertain
 is kaaran vyakti ko sukh-dukh main sambhaav se rahanaa chaiye
 In fact, death is an unshakable truth, which makes the rich poor all their grass and does not make any kind of class distinction
 sachcha gyaan vahi he jo aapke andar ke agyaan ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 a life of simplistic contentment is better than the egoistic life of the rich, in whom dissatisfaction resides
 ek shant mastishk behatar he, taaliyon kii un gadgadahaton se; jo sansadon evam darbaron main sunaayi detii hai
 In fact, this is why Dr
 Radhakrishnan was able to understand the moral values of Indian culture, because he wanted to test the truth of the criticisms made by the missionaries themselves
 isiilie kaha gaya he ki aalochanaayen parishuddhi kaa kaary karti hai
 All mothers want to see higher values in their children
 isi kaaran ve bacchon ko ishwar par vishwaas rakhane, paap se dur rahane evam musiibat main phase logon kii madad karne kaa paath padhaati hai
 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan also learned that respect for all religions has been taught in Indian culture and the sense of equality for all religions is also a unique identity of Hindu culture
 is prakaar unhone bhartiya samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan ko samajha or uske kaafii nazadik ho gayi
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan considered the whole world as a school
 unka maananaa tha ki shiksha ke dwaara hi maanav mastishk kaa sadupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the world should manage education as a single entity
 britain ke edinbura vishvavidhyalay main diye apane bhaashan main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne kaha tha- "maanav ko ek hona chahie
 The complete goal of human history is the liberation of mankind only when the basis of the policies of the countries is to try to establish peace all over the world
 " dow radhakrishnan apni buddhi se paripurna vyakhyaaon, anandadaayi abhivyaktiyon or halki gudgudane vaali kahaniyon se chaatro ko mantramugdh kar dete the
 He also used to motivate his students to adopt high moral values in their conduct
 vah jis bhi vishay ko padhaate the, pehle swayan uskaa gahan adhyayan karte the
 He used to make even a serious subject like philosophy, simple, interesting and dear to his style
 1909 main 21 varsh kii umr main dow radhakrishnan ne madras presidency college main kanishtha vyaakhyaata ke taur par darshan shaastra padhaanaa prarambh kiya
 It was his best fortune that he got a livelihood suited to his nature
 yahan unhone 7 varsh tak na keval adhyaapan kaary kiya apitu swayan bhi bhartiya darshan or bhartiya dharm kaa gaharaai se adhyayan kiya
 In those days, it was necessary for the lecturer that he should also get training for teaching
 isi kaaran 1910 main radhakrishnan ne shikshan kaa prashikshan madras main lenaa armbh kar diya
 At this time, his salary was only 37 rupees
