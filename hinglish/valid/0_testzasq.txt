 However, the theory that according to which the events in heaven are observed in the earth, is observed all over the world
 As part of many astrological traditions, there has been a debate among astrologers on the mechanism that historically worked behind astrology in the West
 
 is pe yah vivaad bhi he kii akashiya pind kya keval chinh maatr hai yaa yah ghatnaon kii purvasuchana hai, yaa phir ve vastav main kisi prakaar kii shakti yaa phir tantra se vaastavik ghatnaon kaa sanchaalan karte hai
 Even though the relationship between astronomical mechanics and terrestrial dynamics was first revealed by Isaac Newton's discovery of the universal theory of gravity, the gravity of celestial bodies gives rise to their astrological effect, not stated by any scientific research, nor Some astrologers supported this
 adhiktar jyotish paramparaayen vaastavik yaa anumaanit akashiya pindon kii saapeksh sthiti or gati par aadhaarit hoti hai yaa phir kisi samay or sthaan par hui ghatana main liye gaye yaa gananaa main shaamil khagoleey swarup par aadhaarit hote hai

jyotish sambandhi pargaman main grahon kii gati ke aadhaar par vyakhya kii jaati he kyonki antariksh or kundali se hokar guzarate samay unki gati mahatvapurn hoti he

 Most Western astrologers have also given up forecasting events, instead focusing on general trends and events
 tulanaatmak drushti se, vaidic jyotish, pravritiyon or ghatnaon donon kii bhavishyavaanee karte hai
 According to skeptics, this method of western astrologers avoids making predictable estimates and gives them the ability to interpret important and arbitrary events as per their convenience

 Due to Vishu's earlier decision, centuries later, the twelve zodiac signs of Western astrology are not related to the same part of the sky as their original constellations
 From the point of view of the heavens, the relationship between the signs and constellations in Western astrology is broken, while It still has supreme importance in Vedic astrology
 donon sabhyataaon ke bich anya matbhedon main shaamil hai- 27 nakshatra yaa chandra bhawan ke prayog jinka upyog bharat main vaidic kaal se kiya ja rahaa he or grahon kii avadhi kii pranali jinhen dasha ke naam se janaa jaataa he

 There has been a lot of diversity in astrology in the western world in modern times
 nae aandolan dikhaai die hai jisane alag alag drushtikonon par dhyaan kendrit karte hue paaramparik jyotish ko asweekaar kar diya he, jaise kii madhyabinduon par zyada jor dena, yaa phir zyaada manovaigyanik drushtikon

 The zodiac is an enclosure or group of constellations through which the sun, moon, and planets transit into the sky
 jyotishiyon ne in nakshatron par dhyaan diya or unako kuch vishisht mahatv diya

 pashchimi or vaidic raashi chakron kaa kundalini jyotish kii parampara main ek hi mul he, isliye donon ek duusare se bahut se myne main samaan hai
 On the other hand in China, the zodiac developed differently
 haalanki chiniyon kaa bhi ek baarah chinhon vaala tantra he, chini raashi chakra shuddh panchang chakra kaa hawaal detaa he, isamen pashchimi or bhartiya raashi chakron se judaa hua koi samakaksh nakshatra nahin he
 a large part of Western astrologers based their work on the tropical zodiac, dividing the sky into twelve equal sections of 30 degrees, beginning with the first point of Aries, where the celestial equator and ecliptic, at the annular equinox of the northern hemisphere See you vishuon ke purassaran ke kaaran, prithvi kaa antariksh main ghurnan karne kaa rasta dhire dhire badalata he, is pranali main raashi chakra chinh kaa samaan naam vaale nakshatra se koi sambandh nahin he, balki wo maheenon or rituon ke sanrekhan main rahete hai
 Those who follow the tradition of Vedic astrology and a small number of astrologers, ie some western astrologers use the same constellation zodiac
 yah raashi chakra usee samaan rup se vibhajit krantimandal kaa prayog karata he lekin raashi chinhon ke samaan naam vaale vichaaradhin nakshatron kii sthiti ke lagbhag sanrekhan main rahata he
 The constellation zodiac differs from the tropical zodiac by an equal distance from what is called ayanamsa, which moves along the inclination of the objects
 iske alaava, kuch nakshatragnata vaastavik, asmaan raashichakron ke nakshatron ko apane kaam main istemaal karte hai

 Hindi Shabdasagar is a large dictionary and first standard dictionary created for the Hindi language
 'hindi shabdhsagar' kaa nimarn nagari prachaarini sabha, kaashi ne kiya tha
 It was first published between 1922-1929
 yah vaigyanik evam vidhiwat shabdkosh mul rup main chaar khandon main bana
 Its principal editors were Shyamsunder Das and Balkrishna Bhatt, Lala Bhagwadin, Amir Singh and Jaganmohan Verma were co-editors

 It contained about one lakh words
 baad main san 1965-1976 ke bich iskaa parivardhit sanskaran 11 khandon main prakashit hua
 It was edited and produced in collaboration with many scholars, activists under the leadership of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das and under the support of a penetrating critic such as Acharya Ramchandra Shakla and Hindi litterateur and under the editorship of Balakrishna Bhatt Shri Amir Singh, Shri Jaganmohan Varma Shri Bhagwadin and Shri Ramachandra Varma Kosh was a great effort

 It has some achievements that are praiseworthy and praiseworthy
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki hidi shabdhsagar ke ananthar bane hidi ke sabhi chote bade koshon kaa yahi mahakosh upjivy or aadhaar rahaa
 The Hindi translation of this acclaimed work of Sri Ramachandra Varma, the eminent editor of Hindi dictionary, is mainly Hindi words
 uskaa mul kalevar tathvik rup main shabdhsagar se hi adhikanshtah pariklit he
 Most of the material in other dictionaries of Hindi is also derived from this dictionary
 purvavarti adhikansh hindi koshon kii bhanti hindi shabdhsagar ek vyakti dwaara nirmit na hokar bhashaa or sahitya ke marmajna anek sudhiyon dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya
 With the help of not only the old dictionary for vocabulary, it was an attempt to collect almost all the common and special words available in texts and practical language and dialects
 praayah prayek shabd kaa mul strot dekhne ke prayaas ke saath saath vibhinn bhashamulak sroton kaa nirdesh karne kii cheshtaa hui
 Although there are many derivatives, which are doubtful and misleading or even impure at some places, the effort and effort as it is for it also holds great importance in itself
 vyakaranamulak vyavastha or tadnusaar shabd evam arth ke vyavasthit nirdesh kaa hindi shabdhsagar main atyant praudh viniyojan dikhaai detaa he
 While Sanskrit dictionaries have wide influence on synonyms and on the one hand, more and more compound words are also mentioned more and more based on Sanskrit grammar, on the other hand the assessment and compilation of the nature and usage tradition of Hindi has also been done with great diligence and mindfulness
 is
 hindi ke muhaavaron or lokoktiyon yaa prayogon athwa kriyaprayogon kii prayagparampara se aagat arthon kii vyakhya bhi isamen paryaapt praudh he
 Explanatory method has been adopted in the semantics in Shabdasagar
 par saath hi mukhya shabdon ke antargat adhiktah paryaay bhi rakh die gaye hai
 For this reason, sometimes it seems that this dictionary has become synonymous with modern form and non-synonymous dictionary together
 vyaakhyaatmak paddati ke antargat vyakti, vishay, vastu aadi kaa puranic, aitihaasik, shastreey or paramparaagat anek prakaar ke parichay evam vivaran yathasthaan die gaye he
 For this reason, this dictionary is also seen touching the environment of encyclopedia, encyclopaedia, charitakosh and technical dictionary
 isamen kuch kamiyaan bhi ginai ja saktin hai
 Experiments and authenticity of all meanings of words are not universally cited examples
 jahaan hai vahaan bhi bahudhaa granthon ke nammaatr hi nirdisht hai
 Their context and version are not mentioned
 anek sthalon par bolchaal ke swanirmit udhaaharan bhi niojit kiye gaye hai
 All in all it has made the periphery of both vocabulary and semantics as broad and wide as possible
 is kshetra main vibhinn peshon or varg ke janajivan se sangruhit shabdabhandar kii sanyojna se is kosh kaa mahatva bahut bad gaya he
 Bait al-hikma refers to either a major Abbasia public academy and intellectual center in Baghdad or a large private library belonging to the Abbasi Khilafat during the Islamic Golden Age
 buddhi ke sadan aupchaarik academy ke rup main apane kaaryon or astitv par ek sakriy or mashhoor centre kahalaaya he
 After the fall of Abbasiya Khilafat, the problem remained complicated due to lack of physical evidence and reliance on literary confirmation
 8 veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main caliph haaron al rashid ke daur main is sadan kii sthapana ek hikmat ke ghar ke rup main kii gai thi or baad main al mamoon shasankaal main saarvajanik academy ban gai thi yaa ar -mansoor dwaara arabi or farsi donon main durlabh kitaaben or kavita sangrah sangrahit karne ke liye ek nijee sangrah banaaya gaya tha 
 Even though it existed as part of the major translation movement that took place during the Abbasid era, translating Persian texts and scientific books from Greek and Arabic, they did exist
 lekin yah sambhaavna nahin he ki bait al-hikma hi sab se pehle bana sadan he, is tarah ke kaam ke centre kairo or damishq main pramukh anuwaad prayaas sadan ke prastaavit pratishthan pehle bhi saamne aae the
 This translation movement provided momentum for a great deal of original research taking place in the Islamic world, with access to texts from Persian, Indian, and Greek sources opposed to the "bookshelf Thesis", which would have diminished Islamic scholarly contributions
 It was the contribution of the House to the translation and preservation of Greek texts
 kilaafat e abbasia kii rajdhani ke rup main shahar kii sthiti ke kaaran, baghdad main islamic duniya ke farsi, arab or anya vidwaanon ke nirantar pravaah se gyaan ke sadan kaa sthaapan sambhav ho gaya tha
 This is evidenced by the large number of scholars who studied in Baghdad between the 8th and 13th centuries, such as His Majesty, like al-jahiz, al-kindi, and al-ghazali
 ek aupchaarik academy ke astitv ke baavjood, baghdad main jeevant academik samudaay, ullekhneey kaaryon kaa ek bada hissaa paidaa karata tha
 The areas where scholars associated with Scholars House contributed to, but are not limited to, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, astronomy, and optics
 librari kaa praarambhik naam, khajaanaat al-hima, durlabh kitabon or kavita ke sangrakshan ke liye ek jagah ke rup main apane kaary se praapt hota he, sadan kaa praathmik kaary iske vinaash tak buddhi
 The House of Wisdom and its contents were destroyed in the siege of Baghdad, little in the way of archaeological evidence of the House of Wisdom, such that much of its knowledge is derived from the works of contemporary scholars of the era such as al-tabari
 And Ibn al-nadeem
 chauthi se 7 veen shatabdi ke dauraan, unani or siriek bhashaaon main vidwaanon kaa kaam yaa to navnirdhaarit kaal se liya gaya tha, yaa ise shuru kiya gaya tha
 The centers of learning and transmission of classical knowledge included the School of Nisibis and later the School of Edsa, and the famous hospitals and medical academies of Jundishapur; Libraries included the Library of Alexandria and the Imperial Library of Constantinople; And included Merv, Salonika, Nishapur and Kittiphone centers
 caliph muvaiya pratham dwaara sthapit umayyad yug ke madhyam se, vah damishq main pustakon kaa sangrah ikattha karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 He then built a library referred to as "bayt al-hikma"
 us samay muslim vidwaanon dwaara vaidya, kemia, bhautik shaastra, ganit, jyotish or anya vishyon ke kshetra main greek, latin or farsi main likhi pustaken bhi ekatra kiye the
 Notably, the Umayyad also regulated paper-making techniques from China and incorporated many ancient intellectual centers under his rule
 or arabi main anuwaad kaaryon ke liye isai or farsi donon vidwaanon ko rojgaar diya, or nae gyaan ko viksit karne ke liye shasit kiya
 These were fundamental elements that directly contributed to the development of scholarship in the Arab world
 750 main, abbasid rajvansh ne umayad ko islamic samrajya ke shaasha rajvansh ke rup main badal diya, or 762 main, caliph al-mansoor ne baghdad kaa nirmaan kiya or damishq ke bajaae ise apni rajdhani bana diya
 The location and worldwide population of Baghdad made it an ideal location for a stable commercial and intellectual center
 abbasid rajvansh ke paas ek majboot farsi jhukaav tha, or sasainian samrajya se kai prathaon ko apanaaya - unamem se, videshi kaaryon kaa anuwaad karne ke alaava, ab granthon kaa anuwaad arabi main kiya gaya tha
 For this purpose, al-mansur established a palace library, built after the Sasanian Imperial Library, and provided economic and political support to intellectuals working there
 unhone yuva abbasid adaalat ke saath ganit or khagol vigyaan ke bare main apana gyaan saajha karne ke liye bharat or anya sthanon ke vidwaanon ke pratinidhimandalon ko bhi aamantrit kiya
 In the Abbasid Empire, many foreign works were translated from Greek, Chinese, Sanskrit, Persian, and Syriac into Arabic
 anuwaad andolan ne khalif al-rashid ke shasankaal ke dauraan badi gati praapt kii, jo apane purvavarti kii tarah vyaktigat rup se chaatravrutti or kavita main ruchi rakhte the
 Originally related texts were mainly medicine, mathematics and astronomy; But, other disciplines, especially philosophy, soon followed
 al-rashid kii librari, house of visdem ke pratyaksh purvavarti ko bet al -himama ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa tha, yaa itihaaskaar al-quifty ne ise khajanaat qutub al-hikma kaha tha
 Under the sponsorship of the Khalifa al-ma'mun, intelligence in general and financial support for scholarship had increased considerably
 iske alaava, abbasid samaaj swayan gyaan ke mulya ko samajhane or saraahna karne ke kaabil bhi bana tha, or vyapaariyon or sena se samarthan bhi rahaa
 Mokas were sung as a symbol of giving this academy to scholars and translators to keep the sustenance and trend alive
 buddhi itani moolyawaan thi ki kitabon or pracheen granthon ko kabhi-kabhi anya dhan kii bajaay yuddh lut ke rup main pasand kiya jaataa tha
 Indeed, Ptolemy's Almagest was claimed as a condition for peace after the war between the Abbasids and the Byzantine Empire
 budhimaan sabha vyapak samaaj se hataae gaye ek academik centre se hin adhik thi
 Its experts served many functions in Baghdad
 bet al-himama ke vidwaan aamtaur par pramukh nirmaan pariyojnaon main ejiniyaron or vaastukaron ke rup main doguna ho jate hai
 They made accurate official calendars and were public servants
 ve aksar chikitsak or salaahkaar bhi the
 al-mamun was personally involved in the daily life of the House of Wisdom, regularly visiting his scholars and inquiring about his activities
 vah academik bahes main bhi bhaag legaa or madhyasthata karegaa
 Inspired by Aristotle, al-ma'mun regularly starts regular discussion sessions and seminars between experts in seminars
 kalam ek darshanik bahes al-mamun apane farsi shikshak, jafar se aage bad rahaa he
 During the debate, scholars will discuss their fundamental Islamic beliefs and principles in an open intellectual environment
 iske alaava, vah aksar apni bauddhik jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye pramukh anusandhan pariyojnaon main bet al-hima se santon ke samooh yojit karenge
 For example, he commissioned the mapping of the world, verifying data from Almagest and deduction of the actual size of the Earth
 unhone misrology ko bhi badhaava diya or giza ke pyramid kii khudaai main khud ko bhaag liya
 al-mamun built the first astronomical observatories in Baghdad, and he was also the first ruler to fund and monitor the progress of major research projects involving a team of scholars and scientists
 vigyaan unki viraasat he or vah 'bade vigyaan' ko nidhi dene vaale pehle vyakti ke rup main jane jate hai
 Following its predecessors, al-mamun would send scholarly expeditions from the House of Scholars to collect texts from foreign lands
 vastav main, is uddeshy ke saath sadan ke nideshkon main se ek constantinopel ko bheja gaya tha
 During this time, Sahl ibn Harun, a Persian poet and astrologer, was the chief librarian of Bayt al-himma
 hunain ebn ishaak ek arab nestorian isai chikitsak or vaigyanik, arabon ke liye 116 kaaryon kaa utpaadan karne vaala sabase utpaadak anuvadak tha
 The patron of this foundation was under the Caliph al-maman
 al-mamun ne house of visdem kii sthapana kii, jisamen hunain ebn ishaak ko charge kiya gaya, jo tab greek granthon kaa sabase manaaya jane vaala anuvadak ban gaya
 As "sheikh of translators" he was put in charge of translation works by the Caliph
 hunain ebn ishaak ne greek medical kitabon ke puure sangrah kaa anuwaad kiya, jisamen galen or hippocrates dwaara prasiddh tukade shaamil hai
 The Sabian Thabit ibn Qurra also translated great works by Apollonius, Archimedes, Euclid and Ptolemy

 By the second half of the ninth century, al-mamun's Bayt al-hima was the world's largest repository of books and became one of the largest centers of intellectual activity in the Middle Ages, the most illustrious Arab and Persian mind
 gyaan ke sadan ne antat seekhney ke centre ke rup main pratishtha hasil kii, haalanki vishvavidhyalay jinhen ham jaanate hai, abhi tak astitv main nahin tha - gyaan sidhe shikshak se chaatr tak pahunchaaya gaya tha, bina kisi sansthagat
 The Makkabs soon began to develop in the city from the 9th century, and in the 11th century, Nizam al-mulak established al-nizamia of Baghdad, one of the first institutions of higher education in Iraq
 al-mamoon ke uttaradhikari al-mutasim or unke bete al-vathik ke tahat gyaan kaa sadan tarakqi kiya
 But al-mutawakkil's reign declined considerably

 The Caliphate was not interested in science and moved away from rationalism, spreading the spread of Greek philosophy as Islamic
 13 farvari ko, mongolon ne shahar main pravesh kiya, khalipha or saare shahar ko sarvanaash puure saptaah tak karte rahe
 The House of Wisdom consisted of a society of scientists and academics, a translation department, and a library that preserved the knowledge acquired by the Abbasids for centuries
 unhone kemia kaa bhi shodh or adhyayan kiya, jise baad main aadhunik rasayan shaastra kii sanrachana banane ke liye upyog kiya gaya
 In addition to this, there were astronomical observatories and other major experimental efforts
 al-mamun dwaara sansthagat, academy ne greek darshanik or vaigyanik prayaason ke pratilekhan ko protsaahit kiya
 Additionally, he imported manuscripts of important texts that were inaccessible from Byzantium to the library to Islamic countries
 buddhi kaa sadan pustkaalay se kahin adhik tha, or usase sambandhit vidwaanon or bauddhikon dwaara mul vaigyanik or darshanik kaam kii kaaphi maatra main utpaadan kiya gaya tha
 This allowed Muslim scholars to confirm the astronomical information given from previous scholars
 anuwaad andolan is sadan ke gyaan main shuru hua or do sadiyon se adhik samay tak chalaa
 For two and a half years, mainly Middle Eastern Oriental Syriac Christian scholars translated all scientific and philosophical Greek texts into the Arabic language at the House of Wisdom
 house of visdem main anuwaad andolan kaa udghaatan aristotl ke vishyon ke anuwaad ke saath kiya gaya tha
 By the time of al-ma'mun, translators had moved beyond Greek astrological texts, and Greek works were already in their third translation
 anuvaadakon main anuwaad shaamil hai: paayathagoras, plato, aristotl, hippocrates, euclid, plotines, galen, sushrut, charaka, aryabhatta or brahmagupta 
 Many important texts were translated during this movement including the composition of medicinal medicines, a book on this mixture and properties of simple medicines, and a book on medical matters by disordis
 in plus kai or anuwaadon ne chikitsa, krishi, vitt or ejineering main pragati ke saath madad kii
 In addition, new discoveries inspired the revised translation and commentary of the work of ancient authors or revised
 kai maamalon main naam or shabdaawalee badal di gai thi; iskaa ek pramukh udhaaharan tolmi ke almaguest kaa sheershak he, jo kaam ke mul naam kaa ek arabi sanshodhan he: megale sintexis 
 In addition to the translation of his earlier works and his commentaries about them, scholars in Bayt al-hikma presented important original research
 udhaaharan ke liye, ullekhneey ganitagya al-khwarijmi ne al-mamoon ke vidwaan ke ghar main kaam kiya or bijganit ke vikaas main unke yogadan ke liye prasiddh he
 Muhammad ibn Musa al-khwarizmi was born around 780 and died around 850

 The word 'algebra' is derived from the Latin version of al-khwarizmi's name which is 'algorithms'
 vah arabon ko hindu ankon or bijganit main pesh karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate the, isliye unhen 'bijganit ke pita' ke rup main janaa jaataa he 
 
 Additionally, al-khwarizmi wrote astrolabe, sundial, and in detail on the geometric model of Ptolemy
 al-khwarijmi ko islam ke pehle bhugolkar ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, jo unke prasiddh chitra ke prithvi chitra ke saath hai
 In the picture of the Earth, he arranged the coordinates of hundreds of cities of the world at that time and gave instructions to draw a new map of the world

 iske alaava, yah ganitagya arab duniya main hindu dashamalav pranali ke parichay ke liye jimmedaar he, or unke madhyam se europe main
 There were also significant breakthroughs in cryptanalysis by al-kindi
 al-khwarijmi ke shuruaati kariyar main, unhone hindu khagoleey sarini ke prati vichaar prastaavit kiye jinhen sindhind kaha jaataa he
 As a result, the Caliph al-mamun sought al-khwarizmi to work on the science of equations
 abu yusuf yaqub ebn ishaak al-kindi bhi ek or aitihaasik vyakti tha jo sadan ke sadan main kaam karata tha
 He studied cryptanalysis but was also a great mathematician
 al-kindi arabi logon ko aristotl ke darshan ko pesh karne vaale pehle vyakti hone ke liye sabase mashhoor he
 He combined Aristotle's philosophy with Islamic theology that created an intellectual platform for philosophers and theologians to debate over 400 years

 It is a matter of very ancient times
 dravid desh main ek pandyavanshi raja rajya karte the
 His name was Indradyumna
 ve bhagwaan kii aradhana main hi apana adhik samay vyateet karte the
 Although there was peace and happiness everywhere in his kingdom
 praja prayek reeti se santusht thi tathaapi raja indradyumna apana samay rajkaarya main kam hi de pate the
 They used to say that only Lord Vishnu arranges my kingdom
 atah ve apane isht param prabhu kii upasna main hi dattachitt rahete the
 The craving for adoration and worship in King Indradyumna's mind continued to grow
 is kaaran ve rajya ko tyaag kar malay-parvat par rahane lage
 His dress was like asceticism
 sir ke bal badhkar jataa ke rup main ho gaye the
 He was constantly engrossed in the worship of the Supreme God
 unke man or praan bhi shri hari ke charan-kamalon main madhukar bane rahete
 Apart from this, they do not like anything in the world
 unhen rajya, kosh, praja tathaa patni aadi kisi praani yaa padaarth kii smriti hi nahin hoti thi
 Once upon a time, King Indradyumna was immersed in the worship of the all-sovereign Lord, after bathing as usual
 unhen bahya jagat kaa tanik bhi dhyaan nahin tha
 At the same time, Maharishi Agastya reached there with all his disciples
 lekin na paaddh, na aghrya or na swaagat
 The silent king Indradyumna was immersed in the meditation of the Supreme Lord
 isse maharishi agastya kupit ho gaye
 He cursed Indradyumna - "this king has not received education from the gurus and is proudly retired from benevolence
 brahmanon kaa apmaan karne vaala yah raja hathi ke samaan jadbuddhi he isliye ise ghor agyanmayi hathi kii yoni praapt ho
 " maharishi agatsay bhagavadbhakt indradyumna ko yah shaap dekar chale gaye
 King Indradyumna, considering it to be the auspicious law of Shri Bhagwan, put his head at the feet of the Lord kshirabdhi main das sahastra yojan lambaa, chaudaa or ooncha trikut naamak parvat tha
 That mountain was very beautiful and excellent
 us parvataraaj trikut kii tarai main rituman naamak bhagwaan varun kaa krida-kaanan tha
 The divine trees were adorned around him
 ve vriksh sadaa pushpon or phulon se laden rahete the
 Very powerful and immensely powerful Gajendra lived with elephants in the deep forest of the mountainous Trikuta near the same sports-season
 ek baar kii baat he
 Gajendra became distraught with his companionship
 vah camel kii gandh se sugandhit vaayu ko soonghkar ek chittkarshak vishaal sarovar ke tat par ja pahunchaa
 Gajendra entered the serene, cool and sweet water of that lake
 pehle to usne jal pikar apni trisha bujhaai, phir jal main snaan kar apana shram dur kiya
 After that he started water sports
 vah apni sound main jal bharkar uski phuhaaron se hathiniyon ko snaan karaane laga
 Then suddenly Gajendra raised the trunk and shouted
 pataa nahin kidar se ek magar ne aakar uskaa pair pakad liya tha
 Gajendra exerted full power to free his leg, but he was not under control, he did not touch his leg
 apane swami gajendra ko grahagrast dekhakar hathiniyaan, kalabh or anya gaj atyant vyakul ho gaye
 They raised the trunk and started running in and out of the lake to save Chigandra and Gajendra
 unhone puri cheshtaa kii lekin safal nahin hue
 In fact, King Indradyumna had become Gajendra due to the curse of Maharishi Agasthya and Gandharshreshtha had become possessed by the curse of Maharishi Deval
 ve bhi atyant parakramee the
 The struggle continued
 gajendra swayan ko baahar khinchataa or grah gajendra ko bheetar khinchataa
 The clean water of the lake became dirty
 camel-dal kshat-vikshat ho gaye
 Water and animals became distraught
 gajendra or grah kaa sangharsh ek sahastra varsh tak chalata rahaa
 Both survived
 yah drashya dekhakar devgan chakit ho gaye
 Gajendra's body eventually relaxed
 uske sharir main shakti or man main utsaah nahin rahaa
 But there was no decrease in the power of graha due to being aquatic
 uski shakti bad gai
 He started pulling Gajendra with more power than new enthusiasm
 asamarth gajendra ke praan sankat main pad gaye
 The arrogance of his power and might was crushed
 vah purnataya niraash ho gaya
 But as a result of the continuous worship of the previous birth, he got Bhagavatsmriti
 usne nishchay kiya ki main karaal kaal ke bhay se charachar praaniyon ke sharany sarvasamarth prabhu kii sharan grahan karata hum
 With this determination, Gajendra, after converting the mind, began to praise the Supreme Lord through the best sources learned in the previous birth
 gajendra kii stuti sunakar sarvatma sarvadev rup bhagwaan vishnu prakat ho gaye
 Seeing Gajendra suffering, Lord Vishnu mounted on Garuda and reached the bank of the said lake very quickly
 jab jivan se niraash tathaa pidaa se chatpataate gajendra ne haath main chakra liye garudarudh bhagwaan vishnu ko tivrata se apni ore aate dekha to usne camel kaa ek sundar pushp apni sound main lekar upar uthaaya or bade ksht se kaha- “narayan ! jagadguro ! bhagwaan ! aapako namaskara he
 " gajendra ko atyant peedit dekhakar bhagwaan vishnu garud kii peeth se kud pade or gajendra ke saath grah ko bhi sarovar se baahar khinch laae or turant apane tikshn chakra se grah kaa munh fadkar gajendra ko mukt kar diya
 Brahmadi Devgans praised Shri Hari and looked at the heavenly Suman on him
 siddh or rishi-maharishi parabrahm bhagwaan vishnu kaa gungan karne lage
 Graha became divine
 usne vishnu ke charano main sir rakhkar pranaam kiya or bhagwaan vishnu ke gunon kii prashansa karne laga
 Freed from the touch of Lord Vishnu's Mangalam Varada Hath, the cursed Huhoo Gandharva revolved around the Lord and went to his lok after paying obeisance to his trilokya-chanted lotus
 bhagwaan vishnu ne gajendra kaa uddhaar kar use apana parshad bana liya
 Gandharva, Siddha and Devgan started singing his Leela
 gajendra kii stuti se prasann hokar bhagwaan vishnu ne sabake samaksh kaha- “pyaare gajendra ! jo log brahm muhoort main uthakar tumhaari kii hui stuti se meraa stvan karenge, unhen main mrityu ke samay nirmal buddhi kaa daan karunga
 " yah kahkar bhagwaan vishnu ne parshad rup main gajendra ko saath liya or garudarud hokar apane divya dham ko chale gaye

 Urubhang is a Sanskrit play written by Bhasa
 yah 2ri se 3ri shatabdi isvi ke bich likhaa gaya
 It is based on the famous epic Mahabharata
 urubhang bhim va duryodhana ke yuddh ke dauraan va uske baad ke duryodhana ke charitra par kendrit he
 Although the central script of Urubhang is the same as that in the Mahabharata, the characterization of the narrative has changed with Bhasa changing some perspectives
 inamen sabase charam badlaav he- bhaas dwaara duryodhana kaa chithran, jo ki mahabharat main ek khalanaayak kii tarah dikhataa he, parantu urubhang main apekshaakrit zyada maanvigunopet dikhaaya gaya he
 While sad dramas are rare in Sanskrit drama, Bhasa's portrayal of Duryodhana's side of the story adds sad elements to the narrative
 urubhang prasiddh mahakavy mahabharat se kuch bhinn he
 While Duryodhana is the villain in the original book, in Urubhang he is shown in a different light
 haalaanki uske mul bure kaaryon se use bakhsha nahin gaya he, parantu use nayakeey gunon se yukt charitra kii tarah dikhaaya gaya he
 The play focuses on the events that preceded his death; When Duryodhana regrets his past, turns to sympathy with his family, and experiences the futility of war
 naatak kii shuruyaat main teen sainik hote hai, jo ki kaurav va pandavon ke bich yuddh par aashcharya se dekh rahe hote hai
 They narrate the scene in front of them with great vividness, they narrate and interject on it alternately
 jaise jaise ve yudhakshetra main chalate hai, ve manjhale pandav bhim tathaa kaurav duryodhana ke bich yuddh tak pahunch jate hai
 Those soldiers then begin to describe the bhima-duryodhana war
 darshakagan yah yuddh purnataya in teen sainikon ke varnan ke madhyam se dekh rahe hai
 Finally, Bhima falls from Duryodhana's incessant strikes
 duryodhana bhim ko maarane se isliye ruk jaataa he ki vah bhoomi par padaa he, jabaki vah bhim dwaara niyam laanghane se apane ghutane tudwa baithta he

 Even today, joint family is considered as a whole family
 In the present times single family is seen as a compulsion
 In our country even today single family is not recognized
 Joint families continue to disintegrate due to industrial development
 is 
 But even today, the importance of joint family has not diminished
 Before discussing the importance of joint family, let us try to throw light on the causes of joint family disintegration, and the danger of their existence
 The reason is the desire to get employment
 Due to the increasing population and decreasing employment, the members of the family move from village to city for their livelihood
 Or does it go from small town to big cities and is required to go abroad in the same episode
 Traditional business or farming fence has its own limitations which are not able to meet all the requirements for the growing family members
 Hence the family has to look for new economic sources
 When new possibilities start coming down in their village or city So the new generation of the family has to go elsewhere in search of Rajghar
 Now they have to settle their family where employment is available
 Because it is not possible for every person to be able to regularly go to the place of origin of his family
 Sometimes he has to go to work hundreds of kilometers away
 The other important reason for the breakdown of the joint family is the ever increasing consumerism
 Has made it more ambitious
 Due to the desire to get more facilities, family stamina is ending, and selfishness is increasing
 TI is going
 Now he finds his happiness not by his happy family or family, but by gathering more happiness resources, and is causing the joint family to disintegrate
 Humans are becoming emotionally disabled while living in single family
 The burden of responsibilities, and unbearable stress has to be endured
 But on the other hand, due to her comfort and increased self-confidence, the path of her future development opens

 Furiously repulsed, he approaches her and confronts the fight
 vah gajani ko maarna hi chahta he ki uskaa smriti lop chakra phir gum jaataa he or vah vartmaan ko bhul jaataa he
 Ghazni turns and stabs him
 vah sanjay kaa mazaaq udaate hue vibhats ghinauni kahani sunaata he ki usne kaise kalpana kii hatya kii thi, tabhi achaanak apni takat kaa antim ubaal paakar sanjay gajani ko kaabo main kar letaa he

 East Pakistan became independent and formed a new country in the form of Bangladesh
 16 disambar ko hi pakistani sena ne sarender kiya tha
 Retired Colonel Bibi Vats, who played a role in the Kargil War, gave 10 major reasons for India's victory and Pakistan's defeat
 1
 us vakt bharat kii leadership indira gandhi ke netritv main strang thi, jabaki pakistan main sainik taanashaah yahaya khan behatar faisle lene main utana sakasham nahin tha
 2
 Cohesion in political diplomacy, bureaucracy and military was better, whereas in Pakistan there was disintegration due to military rule
 3
 bharat ne yuddh se pehle rus ke saath samjhauta kiya tha, international level par bangladesh kii rifuji samasya ko joardaar dhang se uthaaya tha
 Pakistan was forgetful that the US and China would help it
 4
 pakistan kii madad ke liye america ne sevanth flit bede ko hind mahaasaagar main diego garsia tak bhej diya tha, lekin bharat ne rus se jo samjhauta kiya tha, uski vajah se bharat kii madad ke liye rus ne apni newclear sab marin bhej di
 This was in favor of India
 5
 bharat ne east pakistan main teji se war kar teen din main hi air force or neval wing ko tabah kar diya
 Due to this, paratroopers easily landed in Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, which General AAK Niazi found after 48 hours
 6
 pakistan main disijan teking power sirf hair level par centrulij thi
 Because of this, it took time for any decision to come down
 is vajah se pakistan teji se koi stritji nahin bana paaya
 In India, Chief of the Army Staff Manekshaw gave the power to take decisions to both core commanders
 bhartiya sena teji se nirnay lekar hamale kar saki
 7
 West Pakistan started 'crack Down' in East Pakistan
 is vajah se east pakistan kii sena rape, murder or logon ko pratadit karne lagi
 This led to the dissolution of the Army's discipline
 aise main jab unka saamana bharat kii anushaasit sena se hua to unhen harkar sarender karnaa padana
 8
 Pakistan could not find out India's strategy till the end
 usne sochaa tha ki bharat kii sena east pakistan main nadiyon ko paar kar dhaka tak nahin pahunch paaegi or vah border par hi uljhe rahenge
 This proved to be his mistake
 bhartiya sena ne paratrupers kii madad se dhaka ko hi gher liya
 At the same time, with the help of Mukti Vahini, the Indian Army penetrated through the border of East Pakistan
 9
 pakistan main army, navy or airforce main koardination nahin tha
 This is the reason that the three could not act jointly, while the Indian Army was working in unison under the leadership of Field Marshal Manekshaw
 10
 east pakistan main mukti vahini ke rup main jo sena gathit hui, vah pakistan kii sena se ladi or bhartiya sena ko rasta bataaya
 This is the reason that the Indian army was able to reach Dhaka by crossing the rivers of East Pakistan
