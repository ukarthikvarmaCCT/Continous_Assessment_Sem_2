 Sakhi is an adaptation of Sanskrit 'sakshitha'
 sanskrit sahitya main aankhon se pratyaksh dekhne vaale ke arth main sakshi kaa prayog hua he
 Kalidasa has used it in the same sense in Kumarasambhava
 |sidhon ke apbhransh sahitya main bhi pratyakshdarshi ke rup main saakhi kaa prayog hua he, jaise 'sakhi karab jalandhar paae ' 
 Later on in the Nath tradition, only the Gurukhas started being called Sakhi
 inaki rachana kaa silsilaa guru gorakhnath se hi prarambh ho gaya jaan padataa he, kyonki khoj main kabhi-kabhi jogeshwar saakhi jaise padya sangrah mil jate hai
 Kabir was undoubtedly widely propagated in modern indigenous languages, especially among Hindi nirgun saints
 guruvachan or sansar ke vyaavhaarik gyaan ko dene vaali rachanaayen saakhi ke naam se abhihit hone lageen
 Kabir has also said, sakhi aankhi is of knowledge
 kabir ke purvavarti sant nagdev kii saakhi naamak hastlikhit prati bhi mili he parantu uskaa sankalan uttar bharat, sambhavat: punjab main hua hoga, kyonki maharashtra main namdev kii vaani pad yaa abhag hi kehalaati he, saakhi nahin
 According to Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Rajab, a disciple of Dadudayal, divided his master's credentials into organs
 rajjab kaa kaal vikram kii satrahavin shatabdi he-kabir ke lagbhag sau varsh baad
 In Kabir Vachnavali, sakhis are found in various organs
 isse anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kabir vachanaavali kaa sangrah rajjab ke pashchaat hua hoga
 Kabir did not touch 'masi Kagad', so it is likely that his later disciples would have divided his Guru's Sakhis - Sikhavani - into different organs
 saakhi apbhransh kaal se bahuprachlit chand 'duha' main likhi jaati rahi he at: 'duha' kaa paryaay bhi samajhi jaati rahi he parantu tulsidas ke samay tak vah doha kaa paryaay nahin rah gai
 The time of Tulsidas is sixteenth to seventeenth century AD
 prathit hota he ki kabir ke samay se athwa unase bhi pehle saakhi doha ke atirikt chaupai, chaupai, saar, chappay, haripad aadi chhandon main bhi likhi jane lagi thi
 In 'guru Granthsahab', Sakhi is called Saloku
 marathi sahitya main bhi hindi ke prabhaav se 'saki' yaa 'saakhi' kaa chalan ho gaya tha
 Earlier there, she was written in the verse 'dohra'
 par kramash: anya chhandon main bhi prayukt hone lagi
 Like Tulsidas, Marathi saint Swami Ramdas has also calculated his poetry separately from other poetic forms in his famous book Dasbodh- ' naanaa padein, naanaa shloke, Nana Veer, Nana Kakkar, naanaa sakhya, dohare anek, Nomination
 ' No

 chandragupta vikramaditya gupt rajvansh kaa raja
 Chandragupta the second great who is known as Vikramaditya or Chandragupta Vikramaditya in Sanskrit; Was a great powerful emperor of the Gupta dynasty
 unka rajya 380-412 i tak chalaa jisamen gupt rajvansh ne apana shikhar praapt kiya
 That period of the Gupta Empire is also called the Golden Age of India
 chandragupta dwitiya mahaan apane purv raja samudragupta mahaan ke putr the
 He achieved success by following an aggressive expansion policy and beneficial accession policy
 chandragupta dwitiya vikramaditya samudragupta ke eran abhilekh se spasht he ki unke bahut se putr pautra the, kintu apane antim samay main unhone chandragupta ko apana uttaradhikari niyukt kiya
 It is also evident from the records of Chandragupta II and the later Guptasamrats that after the death of Samudragupta, only Chandragupta II became Guptasamrat
 kintu iske vipareet, anshrup main uplabdh 'devichandraguptam' evam katipay anya saahitiyik tathaa puratathvik abhilekh sambandhi pramaanon ke aadhaar par kuch vidvan ramgupta ko samudragupta kaa uttaradhikari pramanit karte hai
 Taking advantage of the disqualification of Ramgupta, Chandragupta defeated both his kingdom and the queen
 ramgupta kii aitihaasikta sandigdh he
 Ramgupta of copper coins obtained from Bhilsa etc
 must have been a local ruler of that region
 chandragupta dwitiya kii tithi kaa nirdhaaran unke abhilekhon aadi ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Chandragupta's, inscribed Mathura pillar inscription in 61, was written in the fifth year of his kingdom
 falat: unka rajarohan guptasanwat 61-5= 56= 375 i
 main hua
 The last known date of Chandragupta II is found on his Rajatamudras - Guptasamvat 90+ 0 = 409- 410 AD
 isse anumaan kar sakate hai ki chandragupta sambhavat: uparilikhit varsh tak shashan kar rahe the
 In contrast, the first known date of Kumaragupta i is found in the Gupta era 96 = 415 AD, from his Bilsand inscription
 is adhar par, aisa anumaan kiya jaataa he ki, chandragupta dwitiya ke shasankaal kaa samaapan 413-14 i
 main hua hoga
 Devagupta and Devaraja-other names seem to be known from various articles of Chandragupta II
 abhilekhon evam mudralekhon se unki vibhinn oopaadhiyon- maharajaadhiraj, parambhagwat, shrivikram, narendrachandra, narendrasingh, vikramank ev vikramaditya aadi- kaa gyaan hota he
 His first military campaign was against the Saka satraps of Saurashtra
 sangharsh prakriya evam anya sambhddha vishyon kaa vistrut gyaan uplabdh nahin hota
 It is clear from Chandragupta's Udayagiri cavalry of the Sandhivagrihaka Veerasena Shaab, that he intended to reach the whole earth
 isi sthaan se praapt chandragupta ke samant shaasha sankanik maharaj ke guptasanwat 82 ke lekh tathaa amrakardav naam ke sainyadhikari ke sanchi guptasanwat 93 ke shilaalekh se maalav pradesh main unki deergh-upasthiti pratyaksh hoti he
 Probably Chandragupta II may have organized the battle of Saka Rudrasinh III and the rule of Saurashtra after victory
 chandragupta kii shakavijay kaa anumaan unki rajathamudraon se bhi hota he
 These postures also occur in imitation of Saurashtra's Shakamudra tradition
 saurashtra kii shaqmudra parampara ke anukaran main prachlit in mudraon par chandragupta dwitiya kaa chitra, naam, virud evam mudraprachlan kii tithi likhit he
 The last date known from Shaka currencies appears to be 388 AD
 iske vipareet in sikkon se gyaat chandragupta kii pratham tithi guptasanwat 90+ 0 he
 As a result, it can be inferred that Chandragupta's national victory would have been almost entirely successful only after 409 AD after 20 years of long war
 chandragupta ke senadhyaksh amrakardav, apane sanchi abhilekh main swayan ko, anek samarawaptvijayyashasupatak: kehete hai
 It can also be inferred from the mention of these many summers that Chandragupta must have fought other wars besides Shakya war
 kintu vartmaan sthiti main unka vivechan apramanit he
 a lunar triumph is engraved on the iron pillar at the side of Qutub Minar in Delhi
 chandra kii pahchaan pracheen bharat ke vibhinn samraaton se kii jaati rahi he 
 But often scholars identify him with Chandragupta II
 yadi is siddhant ko sahi mana jaay to kahana na hoga ki dwitiya chandragupta ne vang pradesh main sangathit rup se aae hue shatruon ko parajeet kiya evam sindhu ke saat mukhon ko paar kar vahlikon ko jeeta
 Vangs are generally identified from the East Bengal and Bahlik, although not surprisingly, the Wahlik lived in western Pakistan
 samrat chandragupta dwitiya ke saath chandra ke abhigyaan ko maanane main kathinaaiyaan bhi hai
 Chandragupta II received his kingdom in succession by his father, but the iron pillar Chandra mentions his self-proclaimed vast empire
 sahitya main bahucharchit samrat vikramaditya or chandragupta vikrmadwitiya donon hi alag samraat hai 


kuch log inako jodakar itihaas ke saath bhadda majaak karte hai 


 Chandragupta's empire was vast
 isamen purv main bengal se lekar uttar main sambhavat: balkh tathaa uttar-pashchim main arab sagar tak ke samast pradesh sammilit the
 With a view to providing stability to this vast empire, Chandragupta established matrimonial relationships with many powerful and Aishwaryamukhi royal families
 swayan unki dwitiya rani kuberanaga 'nagkulasanbhuta' thi
 The influence emanating from Kuberanaga was married to Vagataknaresh Rudrasen II
 naagon evam vaakatakon kii bhugolic sthiti se siddh he ki unase guptasamrajya ko paryaapt bal evam sahaayta mili hogi
 It is known from the Talagund inscription of Kadamba Naresh Shantivarman of Kuntal Pradesh that the daughters of King Kakustha Varman were married to Guptas and other kings
 kumari kaa vivaah chandragupta dwitiya yaa unke kisi putr se hua hoga
 The empire was divided into various units to facilitate governance
 samrat swayan rajya kaa sarvocch adhikari tha
 There was a Council of Ministers to help him
 raja ke baad doosraa ucch adhikari yuvaraj hota tha
 The minister was the chief officer and chairman of the Council of Ministers
 chandragupta dwitiya ke mantri shikharaswami the
 They are also called Kumaramatya in the Karamdand inscription
 is sambandh main yah gyatavya he ki guptkaal main yuvaraajon ke saahayya ke liye swatantra parishad hua karti thi
 Veersen Shaab has been called 'anayavayapratyasakasiva'
 ye chandragupta ke sandhivigrahik the
 But the Chief of Army Staff was probably Amarkardava
 chandragupta ke samay ke shaskeey vibhaagon ke adhyakshon main kumaramatyaadhikaran balaadhikaran ranbhandadhikaran dandpashadhikaran vinayashur mahapratihar talavar mahadandanayak vinayasthitisthaapak bhatashwapati or uparik aadi mukhya hai
 The largest unit of governance was the province
 praanton ke mukhya adhikari uparik kahe jate the
 The Governor of the archery-upper-tribunal was Maharaj Govindgupta
 unki rajdhani vaishali thi
 The provincial unit of governance was called Desh or Bhukti
 praanton kaa vibhaajan anek pradeshon yaa vishyon main hua tha
 The department of the supreme government officer of Vaishali was called vaishali-adhisthana Adhikaran
 nagaraan evam graamon ke shashan ke liy alag parishad hoti thi
 Gramsikas, Mahtars and Bhojks were responsible for village governance
 chandragupta kii rajdhani patliputra thi
 But in the records of the later Kuntalnaras, he has been called both Patalipuravaradhishwar and Ujjayinipurvaradhishwar
 bahut sambhav he, ki shaq rudrasingh kii paraajay ke baad chandragupta ne hapane rajya kii duusari rajdhani ujjayini banaai ho
 In literature, Vikramaditya has also been associated with both these cities
 ujjayini vijay ke baad hi kabhi maalav sanwat vikramaditya ke naam se sambhddha hokar vikram-sanwat naam se abhihit hone laga hoga
 Thus, this year 58 BC Seems to have started chandragupta ke rajyakaal main chini yatri phahyan ne bharat kaa bhraman kiya
 Fahyan has given very lively mention of the social and religious situation and system of the time
 madhyadesh kaa varnan karte hue phahyan ne likhaa he ki log raja kii bhoomi jotate hai or lagaan ke rup main upaj kaa kuch ansh raja ko dete hai
 And when they want, then they leave their land and go and live where it comes to mind
 raja na prandand detaa he or na shaareerik dand
 Penalty is imposed keeping in view the gravity or brevity of the crime
 baar baar rajdroh karanevaale aparaadhon kaa dahinaa haath kaat liya jaataa he
 State officials receive fixed salaries
 neech chandalon ke atirikt na to koi jeevahinsa karata he, na madirapan karata or na lahasun pyaas khaataa he
 In Pataliputra, Fahyan saw the grand palaces of Ashoka's time

 Pataliputra was the largest city in Madhya Pradesh
 log dhani or udaar the
 Competed with each other in doing good religious work
 desh main chor daakuon kaa koi bhay nahin tha
 The economic prosperity of Chandragupta's period is confirmed by his abundant gold coins
 iske atirikt usne rajat evam tamra mudraon kaa prachlan bhi kiya
 The circulation of silver and copper was probably local, but its golden coins were for universal circulation

 Scale on a map means the ratio of distances between two points shown on the map and their corresponding surface locations
 saanchaa:is lekh kii vartanee thik karne kii aavashyaktaa he The scale is the ratio of the actual distance between any two points on the plane and the distance between the same two points on the map
 saral shabdon m kaha ja saktaa he k dharaatal va maanach k dooray ke anupaat ko maapak kehete ha
 For example, the actual distance between two places on the ground is 1 km
 1 cm in the map

 Decade Bhan method: This is a regulatory measure in which the measure is shown as a Bhan

 The value of the numerator is always 1 unit, for example, if a decade of a map is 1 / 100, 000, one unit of the map is equal to 100,000 units of the ground
 is vadh k sabase adhak upyogta he yak dashak bhan se kasi bhi desh m vahaan k maap nal se raikhak dooryaan t k ja sakati he ran maapni pard ja sakati he
 Graphical slaughter: It is also called a linear measure

 = 5 cm 1 cm on the map
 = 5 reduction on the ground
 1 cm = 5 x 1 xxrep 5 0 cm Therefore, decade 1: 5 xxrep 5 0 2 cm = 1 km, 2 hectamers and 6 decameters 2 cm

 madhya yug main aaj ke moldova kaa adhikansh hissaa moldova rajya kaa hissaa hua karata tha
 In 1812, the eastern part of this kingdom was captured by the Russian Empire and named Bessarabia
 Between 1856 and 1878 the two southern provinces were reunited in Moldova, which together with Velacia in 1859 formed modern Romania
 1917 main roosi samrajya ke vighatan ke baad pehle swytt or baad main swatantra moldovian loktantric ganraajya kaa gathan kiya gaya, jo 1918 main vrihadtar romania ke saath mil gaya
 In 1940, Bessarabia was captured by the Soviet Union and divided into the Ukrainian SSR and the newly formed Moldovian SSR

 garlfriend shabd kaa prayog kisi gaiyr-vaivaahik romantic rishte main ek mahila saathi, athwa anya mitron kii tulana main zyada kareeb ek gaiyr-romantic mahila mitra ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 There is no clear definition of the term and the debate over the true meaning of girlfriends is still ongoing
 pashchimi samaaj main aamtaur par yah mana jaataa he ki "garlfriend" states kii shuruyaat do logon dwaara dating ke liye sahamat ho jane par hoti he
 Getting a girl to agree to it is considered a great achievement for the youth and is seen as a superior level among her peers based on the image of the girl
 kuch logon ke anusaar "garlfriend" tathaa "girl friend", yaa "boyfriend" tathaa "boy friend" ke bich kaa antar, haalaanki kaaphi sookshm hota he parantu kaaphi mahatvapurn bhi hota he
 
 If viewed purely grammatically, then "girlfriend" or "boyfriend" is someone with whom you have a romantic relationship
 jabaki ek "girl friend" yaa "boy friend" maatr ek mitra he jisaki pahchaan uske ling ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 Many times this definition is also violated by simply saying "girlfriend" or "boyfriend"
 "friend girl" shabdon ko aksar ghanishtha mitrataa ke liye bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The change between these two is an important aspect of adolescent development
 iske baavjood "garlfriend" tathaa "girl friend" ke donon roopon ko alag-alag logon dwaara alag-alag arthon ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 For example, when the term "girlfriend" is used by a girl or woman for another woman in a non-sexual and non-romantic context, to avoid confusing sex or romantic meaning, - Sometimes its two-word form "girl friend" is used, although there is no such rule
 "garlfriend" shabd ke prayog ke is tareeke ko kaaphi kareebi mitron ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he or isamen koi yon sambandh shaamil nahin hota he, basharte ise lesbian, bai-sexual, yaa pan-sexual mahilaon ke liye istemaal na kiya ja rahaa ho
"garlfriend" shabd ko algebiti samudaayon main bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he or yah kisi bhi ling athwa langikta ko ingit kar saktaa he
 The term "girlfriend" is not necessarily intended to refer to sex, but it is often used for a woman who is dating a man but is not engaged to her; But this does not mean that they have sex with each other
 yon gatividhiyon kii bhinn apekshaaon ke chalate dating shabd romantic gatividhi kii taraf ishaara kar saktaa he jabaki keval "friend" shabd kaa prayog karke antarangta ko ingit karne se bachaa ja saktaa he
 It is basically equivalent to the word "sweetheart", which is also used in the sense of attachment
 ek samaan lekin asamatuly tathaa adhik aspasht shabd he "ladi friend" - stri ling kaa koi saathi jiskaa darja sambhawatah ek garlfriend se to kam kintu ek mitra se adhik hota he
 That is, it is not necessary that the relationship has reached its climax nor has it formed an exclusive, serious, committed, or long-term relationship
 iske baavjood bhi yah shabd ek mahila ko kisi kii "mistress " yaa "lover " kehane par khule rup se prakat hone vaale yon sambandh ko pradarshit karne se bachataa he
 In this context, it can often be in the form of a euphemism
 haalanki hameshaa hi aisa nahin hota he: kai baar iskaa istemaal us vakt bhi kiya jaataa he jab kisi vyakti ko kisi purush ke saath sambandhit mahila ke str ke bare main thik-thik pataa nahin hota he
 For example, in newspaper headlines it is often written that a celebrity has been seen with a new "lady friend"
 "ladi friend" ko ek umr-daraaj mahila ke saath romantic sambandh darshane ke liye bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki "garlfriend" kaa "girl" shabd yahaan aayu ke anusaar upyukt nahin baithta he

 jo bhi ho, lucas ek swatantra film nirmaan centre bananaa chahta tha - jo ski walker ranch ho saktaa tha- or unhen series ko vittaposhan karne vaale agent ke rup main istemaal karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 Alan Dean Foster had begun writing the first of the novel, but Lucas decided to abandon the plan to adopt Foster's writing work; The following year the book was published as Splinter of the Mind's Eye
 pehle pahal aarambh main lucas ne james bond filmon kii shrunkhlaa kii hi tarah nirdhaarit shrunkhlaa kii sankhya ke bina hi filmon kii series kii purv kalpana kii
 In an interview with Rolling Stone in August 1977, he stated that he wanted each of his friends to take turns to direct films and give the series an innovative economy
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kahani kii pichhali kadi jahaan daarth vadeyr bure paksh main badal jaataa he, ljuk'sa ke pita kii hatya kar detaa he or ben kenavi ken saath ek jwalamukhi par sangharsh rat rahata he or isi bich gangey ganraajya kaa patan ho jaataa he- yah sab milakar ek utkrisht uttar katha kii sanrachana karenge
 Later that year, Lucas contracted science fiction writer Ley Brackett to write Star Wars II
 navambar 1977 ke ant tak unhone ek kahani sammelan kaa aayojan kiya, jisamen lucas ne da empire strix back naam se ek hastlikhit sankshipt rachana prastut kii
 The composition was very consistent with the film's finale except for the incident when Darth Vader does not reveal that he is Luke's father
 pehle masaude main jahaan se bracket likhnaa aarambh karegaa, luk kaa pita luk ko nirdesh dene ke liye prakat hota he
 Brackett made his first draft in early 1978; Lucas said that he was disappointed by this, but before he discussed it with her, she died of cancer
 koi lekhak uplabdh nahin hone ke kaaran, lucas ko doosraa praaroop swatah likhnaa padaa
 isi praaroop main lucas ke pehali baar filmon kii shrunkhlaa kii sankhya ke liye "episod" shabd kaa vyavhaar kiya, jisaki suchi main empire strix back episod II tha
 As Michael Kaminski has expressed his disappointment with the first draft, while arguing about The Secret History of Star Wars, perhaps Lucas had to consider turning the story in another direction
 He gave the plot a new twist: Darth Vader claims to be Luke's father
 lucas ke anusaar, unhen is praaroop ko likhane main kaaphi majaa aayaa, kyonki yah pehali film ke saalon sangharsh ke lekhan ke thik vipareet tha or unhone sheeghra hi april 1978 tak do or praaroop likh daale
 He leads the script to the final extent of darkness when he is imprisoned by Han Solo Karbonnite and left in a prison like prison
 kahani kaa yah nayaa padaav jisamen daarth vadeyr ljuk ke pita ke rup main rahasyodghatit hota he, series par apana prabal prabhaav daalata he
 Michael Cumminski argues in his book that it does not appear that perhaps this point of the plot has been considered so seriously or even imaginaryly conceptualized before 1978, and that is why the first film was a sequel to an alternate story
 While Vader is separated from Luke's father, there is no reference to this plot point before 1978
 empire strix back ke duusare or tisare praaroop ke likhane ke baad jisamen is vindu ko shaamil kar liya gaya he, lucas ne pichhali kahani kii nai kadi jisaki usne rachana kii he uski dubaara samikshaayen kii; anakin skywanker ben kenobi kaa meghavi chaatr tha; uske ek luk naam kaa ek baccha tha lekin samraat palpatin ke prabhaav main aakar vah andhere kii paksh kii ore mud gaya tha 
 anakin ben kenobi ke saath jwalamukhi ke kshetra main ladata rahaa or aahat bhi ho gaya tha, lekin tab vah daarth vadeyr ke rup main punerjeevit ho gaya
 Meanwhile, Kenobi hides Luke at a fictional house called Tatooine until the Republic becomes an empire and Vader discovers the Jedi Knights
 pichhali kahani kii is nai kadi ke sthaan par, lucas ne faisla kiya ki shrunkhlaa trayee hogi, jisame empire strix back ko episod II agle praaroop main episod v main badal diya jayega
 laurence kasdan, jinhonen abhi-abhi reders of da lost arq likhnaa samaapt hi kiya tha, unhen agle praaroop ke lekhan ke liye anubandhit kar liya gaya or nirdeshak irven karshanar se unhen atirikt sahyog bhi mila
 Kasdan, Karshanar and producer Gary Kurtz felt that the film had become a very serious and adult film, helped by the new dark black story outline, and the series was developed from the light-hearted original storyline of the first story
 1981 main jab unhone episod VI likhnaa aarambh kiya, ab kaaphi kuch badal chukaa tha
 Building Empire Strikes Back was stressful and costly, and Lucas' personal life was also shattered
 kaaphi klaant hokar or ab aage star wars films nahin banane kii chaah rakhte hue, may 1983 main time magazine ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main usne pratigya kii ki series ke saath ab uskaa kuch lenaa dena nahin he
 Lucas's 1981 primary format featured Darth Vader competing for his authority over Luke - and in the second screenplay, "modified Primary Format", Vader became a sympathetic character
 laurence kasdan ko ek baar phir daayitv saupa gaya or in antim praroopon main, vadeyr kaa mukhauta utaar diya gaya
 This change in character will provide a sudden jump in the storyline of "tragedy of Darth Vader" which is embedded in earlier parts
 lambe 1987 main vivaah-viched ke niptaan main saubhaahgya ke lambe samay ko kho dene ke baad, lucas ko star wars main phir se laut aane kii koi ichha hi nahin rah gai or gaiyr aadhikarik taur par ritern of da jedy ke samay tak uttarbhag trayee ko radd kar diya
 However, the former part which had developed a lot, captivated his mind
 dark horse ke hasya-vyangy kii dhara or timothy zaan ke upanyaason kii trayee ke star wars ke ek baar phir se lokapriy ho jane ke baad, lucas ne dekha ki abhi bhi iske badi sankhya main darshak hai
 His children were now slowly growing up, and after the explosion of CGI technology, they were now thinking about returning and directing
 1993 tak variety ke saath anya sutron ke hawaale se isaki ghoshnaa kar di gai, ki ve purvabhag kaa nirmaan karenge
 He began to outline the story, now hinting that the series would be tragic due to Anakin Skywalker's passing the ordeal toward evil
 lucas ne kuch kahani main kuch badlaav laana bhi shuru kar diya taaki purvabhag kaa moulik ke saath saapeksh sambandh barkaraar rahe
 At first these episodes from the previous part of the previous story were considered as "filling the empty space" of history, so that parallel or tangential existence would remain, but now they saw that they would now start a new long story
 Which will begin with Anakin's childhood and end in death
 film kii series ko ek "aakhyaan" main roopantarit kar dene kii ore badhata hua antim charan tha
 In 1994, Lucas began writing the first screenplay titled Episode I: The Beginning
 is film kii release ke saath hi saath, lucas ne yah ghoshnaa kii ki vah agali do kaa bhi nirdesan karegaa or usne episod II par usee samay kaam karnaa shuru bhi kar diya
 The first draft of Episode II was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired a writer Jonathan Hales from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles to scrape the format
 film ke sheershak ke bare main anishchayta kii sthiti main, lucas ne majaak se hi sahi film ko "jaar jars great adventures" kah daalaa
 Written by The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas initially decided that Lando Kalrissian was a rodent and came from a planet with clones that led to "clone Wars" which is mentioned by Kenobi in a New Hope ; Later he introduced an alternate concept of the entire army of clones who came from the planet that attacked the republic and the Jedi Rann were repelled by the bankers
 pichhali katha ke ye aadharbhoot tatv episod II ke kathanak kii aadharshilata bane, jisamen atirikt nai gupt suchanaaen jod di gai ki sampoorn ghatnakram palpatin kii vyaktigat chal yojana thi
 Even before the release of Attack of the Clones, Lucas began working on Episode III, with specific notions to the cast of the hypothesis that the film would begin with a film collection of the Seven Clones War
 jaisaa ki unhone kahani kii ruparekha kii usee greeshm main samikshaayen kii, haalanki ve kehete hai ki unhone kathanak main amul parivartan kar suvyavasthit kar liya he
 Michael Cumminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, testifies that Anakin's fallout on the dark side forced Lucas to make a radical change in the story, the first opening scene involving Palpatine being kidnapped and Dooku as Anakin
 Killing was the first scene in the latter turning to the dark side
 san 2003 main mukhya chhayankan ke puraa ho jane ke baad, lucas ne uske puri tarah se andhere jagat kii ore mudane ko phir se likhakar anakin ke charitra main or bhi kai bade parivartan kiye; ab vah prathamtah padmi ko maut se bachaane kii talash kii ore mudega, na ki pichley sanskaran kii tarah jisamen kai kaarnon main se ek yah bhi shaamil tha, ki use vastav main use yah vishwash tha ki jedy bure the or ganraajya par kabza karne kii sajeesh rach rahe the
 This original rewrite was completed through both editing and key footage, and now the newly revised scenes were filmed during the rapid filming of 2004
 lucas series ke liye jo kuch bhi tathy pesh karte the vah aksar atishyoktipurna ho jaaya karata tha; jiskaa adhikansh uttar-1978 kii avadhi se pratifalit hua tha jab series ek mahatvapurn ghatana main badal gai thi
 Michael Kaminski elaborated that these exaggerations are both a measure of publicity and security
 kaminsaki ne tark sangat vyakhya dete hue kaha ki chunki varshon se shrunkhlaa kii kahani main amul parivartan ho gaya he
 Therefore, Lucas intended to change the original story in a retrospective manner as the audience would only see the fact from their own perspective
 san 2005 ke ek showest ke sammelan main, lucas ne nai takanic kaa pradarshan kiya or kaha ki nae 3-D ke praaroop main chah filmon ke prasaaran kii unki yojana he; jisaki shuruyaat 2007 main a new hope se hui
 However, around January 2007, Lucasfilm stated in starwars
com that "there is no definite plan and date to broadcast the Star Wars saga in 3-D"
 At a July 2007 festival in Europe, Rick Macklem confirmed that Lucasfilm "plans to convert all six films to 3-D", but that they are "waiting for companies to appear Are developing technology to reduce the level of cost so that it becomes meaningful for everyone
 In July 2008, Geoffrey Katzenberg, Chief Executive Officer of dreamworks Animation Ulasa that George Lucas is to redo 3-D all six films
 lucas ne ateet main yah sanket diya he ki vah bhavishya main chah star wars kii filmon ke nirnaayak sanskaran aagaamee peedi ke home-video praaroop par prasaarit karenge
 is bare main vichaar-vimarsh hote rahe ki is maukey kaa upyog antimprasaran se pehle kisi prakaar ke antim samaayojan, parivartan, parivardhan or / athwa film main kisi prakaar kaa vyavkalan karne ke liye karenge

 Lucasfilm's vice president of marketing, Jim Vord, announced that Lucasfilm wants to work on films even more, adding that "as technology progresses and we find a high-quality, sophisticated platform that customers can easily consume If we can do it, the situation will be even better, but still a lot will be left to do

 thiodolite kshaitij or urdhwadhar donon tarah ke konon ko maapne kaa upkaran he, jiskaa prayog, trikoshmetiya network main kiya jaataa he
 It is one of the most important tools used in surveying and engineering work done in inaccessible places
 aajkal vikonman ko anukulit kar vishisht uddeshyon jaise ki mausam vigyaan or rocket prakshepan praudyogiki jaise kshetron main bhi upyog me laayaa ja rahaa he
 a modern devoid has a mobile telescope located between two vertical axes
 is doordarshee ko ek icchit vastu par ingit karke in dono akshon ke konon ko ati parishuddhta ke saath mapa ja saktaa he
 Transit developed in the early 19th century was a special form of distortion for the visionary that had a 'flop over' feature that could be easily retrospectively
 saath hi truti kam karne ke liye konon ko doguna kiya ja saktaa tha
 Some transit devices were then able to directly measure an angle of thirty arc-seconds
 20 veen shatabdi ke madhya main, pargaman ko ek kam parishuddhta ke ek saadhaaran vikonman ke rup main janaa jane laga tha, par isame maapak aavardhan or yantric meter jaise suvidhaon kaa abhaav tha
 Transit has declined in importance since the introduction of compact, accurate electronic deviations but is still used as a lightweight device at construction sites
 kuch pargaman urdhwadhar kone nahin maap sakate he
 Often a construction-level is mistakenly assumed to be a transit, but is actually a type of diagonal angle measuring instrument
 yah na to kshaitij or na hi urdhwadhar kone maap saktaa he
 It consists of a spirit-level and a visionary through which the user establishes a visual line on a flat plane
 koi saidhantik bhinnata ke na hone par bhi mukhyat: do aadhaaron par vikonmaanon kaa vargeekaran hua he
 The basis of the first type of classification is whether or not the telescope can travel full circle in the vertical plane
 vargeekaran kaa doosraa aadhaar he, yantron main lage ankit vrutt ke vibhaajan-ansh padhane kii suvidha, jaise varneer vikonman, jisamen vrutt ke vibhaajan ansh padhane ke liye varneer maapni kaa prayog hota he; micrometer vikonman, jinamein ansh padhane ke liye sookshmmapi pechon kaa prayog hota he; kaanch-chaap vikonman, jinamein kaanch ke ankit vrutt hote hai or unke padhe janevaale chaapon ke pratibindu ko prekshak ke saamne laane kii prakaashiya suvidh kii vyavastha hoti he
 Vernier Theodolite is the oldest spec
 puraane vikonmaanon ke ankit vrutt bade vyas ke hote the, jisase kushal karigar inpar bhalee prakaar sahi vibhaajan kar saken
 It was built by Colonel Everest, the Surveyor General of the Survey of India, more than a hundred and fifty years ago
 vah yantra aaj bhi ukt vibhaag ke dehradun sthit sangrahalay main rakhaa he1 iske kshaitij vrutt kaa vyas ek gaj he
 The diameter of the horizontal circle of the catchment theodolite is about 2
5 inches
 pehle pahal varneer ko hi vyas ke aadhaar par baanta jaataa rahaa he jaise 12"", 10"", 8"", 6"" evam 5"" varneer aadi
 Vernier's reading capacity is up to 20 seconds, micrometer 10 seconds accurate and up to 3 seconds close, and one second in depth
 kachachaap main kuch vishesh prasiddh naam he tavistok, wild, tathaa zees vikonman
 At which point the angles formed by other points have to be determined, the device is tightened by placing a tripod
 urdhv plate vaali dhuree ke nichevale sire main ek kaanta laga rahata he
 Hanging the plumb with a string, the legs of the tripod are fastened in such a way that the tip of the plumb points right
 is kriya ko cendran kehete hai
 Subsequently, the eyelet is rotated back and forth in such a way that the cruciferous fibers of the diaphragm are clearly visible
 phir doorabeen par die focus pench ko ghumaakar doorabeen main dur kii vastu kaa spasht pratibimb dekha jaataa he
 This action is called focusing
 focus tab sahi mana jaataa he jab netrika ke paas aankh dhire-dhire upar neeche karne se pratibimb tantuon se hatataa na dikhaai de
 This is called elimination
 iske baad kshatijakaari penchon ko samuchit rup se ghumaakar urdhv plate par lage pansal kaa bulbula kendrit kiya jaataa he, jisase plate ko ghumaakar kisi bhi sthiti main rakhane se bulbula kendrit rahe
 This action is called horizontalization
 pun: doorabeen saadhane ke stambh se lage ek pench se urdhvavrutt ke varneron par lage pansal kaa bulbula kendrit kar diya jaataa he
 After performing the above actions, the binoculars are rotated and stopped in such a way that the vertical circle is read, the vernier coincides with the zero line, or the mark-line, on the line of the vertical circle
 tab yadi yantra purnataya samanjit ho to nimnlikhit pramukh dashaayen praapt hoti hai : The device is not fully accommodated if a suitable connection is not established
 yantra kii banaavat main aisi suvidhaon kaa samavesh rahata he ki in sambandhon kii pariksha ho sake or aavashyak hone par samanjan kriya ja sake

 The word adult has three different meanings
 pehla: yah ek purna viksit vyakti ko darshata he, doosraa: yah ek paudhe yaa jaanavar ko bhi ingit karata he jisane purna vikaas kar liya ho teesraa: kisi kaam ke liye vyakti ne ek kanoonee umr praapt kar lee ho 
 It is the antonym for a minor
 vayaskta ko jeev vigyaan, manovaigyanik vayask vikaas, kanoon, vyaktigat charitra, yaa saamaajik sthiti ke sandarbh main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 These various aspects of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory
 ek vyakti jeev vigyaan ke anusaar ek vayask, ho saktaa he or uske shaareerik or vyavhaar sambandhi lakshan bhi vayasko vaale ho sakate hai lekin phir bhi use baccha mana jayega, kyonki usne ek kanoonee umr nahin praapt kii he
 Conversely a person can legally be an adult even if he does not have any signs of maturity and responsibility that define adult character
 vidhishastra yaa nyaayashastra, vidhi kaa siddhanth, adhyayan va darshan hai
 This includes all legal principles that make laws
 vidhishastra ke vidwaan, jinhen jurist yaa vidhik siddhantavaadi bhi kaha jaataa hai, vidhi, vidhik karann, vidhik pranali or vidhik sansthaaon ke prakruti kii gahari samaj praapt kar paane kii aashaa rakhte hai
 Jurisprudence as a science of law, is a special kind of research about law
 saadhaaran arth main samast vaidhanik siddhant vidhishastra main antarnihit hai
 Jurisprudence "jurisprudence" ie Juris = Legislation, Prudence = Knowledge
 is arth main kanoon kii sari pustaken vidhishastra kii pustaken hai
 In this context, the only meaning of the law is the general law of the country, which is completely separate from the rules, which are called law because of their resemblance to law
 yadi ham vigyaan shabd kaa prayog iske adhik se adhik vyapak rup main kare jisamen bauddhik anusandhan ke kisi bhi vishay kaa gyaan ho jaae to ham kah sakate hai ki vidhishastra desh ke saadhaaran kanoon kaa vigyaan he
 The oldest Indian jurisprudence is present in many texts of theology, such as Bodhoyan's theology
 vidhi main maanav ko bhaavnaatmak sambal pradaan karne va prakruti dwaara pradutt sukh-suvidhaon ke samyak upbhog hetu samaan adhikaar he
 This method, protected in human interest by law, is called "natural law"
 alpian -"daivi or maanviya vastuon kaa gyaan, uchit evam anuchit vastuon kaa vigyaan" Jurisprudence is divided into three branches - vaidhanik abhidarshan kaa uddeshy he kisi prastaavit vidhi kii pranali ke tathy ko, chaahe vah vartmaan ho athwa bhootkaal main iskaa astitv rahaa ho, upasthit karnaa
 The purpose of statutory history is to present the historical process by which a law system has developed or occurred
 vidhinirmaan ke siddhant kaa uddeshy he kanoon ko upasthit karnaa-vah kanoon nahin jo vartmaan he yaa bhootkaal main tha, balki vah kanoon jo desh, kaal, paatr ke anusaar hona uchit he
 Jurisprudence does not expect the present or past of any legal system, it is related to its ideal future
 vidhishastra siddhanth ke teen ang hote hai- vishleshnatmak vidhishastra, aitihaasik vidhishastra, evam naitik vidhishastra
 The analytical branch consists of philosophical or general ideas of systematic legal theory; The historical branch contains the philosophical or general part of the legal history; The moral branch contains philosophical principles of legislation
 kintu ye teenon shakhaayen paraspar sambhddha hai
 Therefore, separating them from each other cannot consider them
 dekhen, vishleshnatmak vidhishastra The purpose of analytical jurisprudence is - 'analysis of fundamental principles of legislation'
 inke aitihaasik udgam, vikaas, naitik bhav athwa manyata par is prasang main vichaar aavashyak hota he
 The following topics are covered under this- mulat: vidhaan ke saadhaaran siddhanton ke udgam evam unke vikaas se sambhddha he
 The sources by which the ordinary legislation of the country is affected are also within its limits
 anya shabdon main, yah vidhaan ke mul siddhant evam unki paddati kii bhaavana kaa itihaas he
 Ethical jurisprudence treats the law in terms of moral seriousness and its completeness
 kanoon kii pranali ke bauddhik tatv athwa iske aitihaasik vikaas se ise koi prayojan nahin he
 The purpose of the legislation and to what extent and in what form it is fulfilled, this is its subject
 saadhaarant: iskaa lakshya evam uddeshy kisi raajnneetik ferme ke antargat rajya kii bhautik shakti dwaara nyaay kaa paalan karne main he
 Hence, moral jurisprudence looks at how far the principle of justice is related to legislation
 yah naitik evam vaidhanik darshan kaa milanbindu he
 Justice in its general form is related to morality or moral philosophy
 apane vishesh rup main nyaay, desh ke kanoon kii antim shrunkhlaa ke rup main vaidhanik darshan kii us shakha se sambhddha he, jise naitik vidhishastra kehete hai
 General within its periphery: The following topics fall under- dekhen, tulanaatmak vidhishastra In different countries of the world, jurisprudence has been defined in some different forms
 germany ke vidhaan main vidhishastra kanoon kaa motamoti vah paryaay he, jiskaa lakshya vaigyanik adhyayan hota he
 In the French legislation, this gives a sense of jurisdiction of the court, which distorts and develops the "code" of the law
 angreji evam amareeki vidhaan main sannihit hai
 Sanatana is based on theology in Indian legislation
 "dharm" kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit rup main kii gai he- That is, Vedas, Smriti, Virtue and Suniti are the origin of religion
 "dharm" vyapak shabd he
 From religious, moral, social and legal point of view, it is a collection of duties and responsibilities of man
 dharmik evam dharm nirpeksh bhaavana ke bich vibhaajan rekha sthapit nahin kii ja sakati, kyonki kitne hi vishay aise hai jo dharmik evam sansaarik donon hai
 The eternal religion of India is not based on the order of the king or ruler
 isaki manyata isi main antarnihit he
 Smritiks and their ancestors have stated that “dharma is the gift of God
 yah raajaaon kaa raja he
 No one is more powerful than this
 isaki sahaayta se shaktiheen bhi shaktishaalee se apana adhikaar le sakate hai
 The king is not the creator of justice, only its foster
 " According to the theory of jurist Austin Kinwa Bentham, most of Sanatana Dharma will be embedded in morality, because this "religion" is not the order of a king or sovereign ruler
 yah satya he ki smriti apane tain kanoon nahin he, kyonki ise na to vyavasthapika sabha ne banaaya or na rajya ne ghoshit kiya
 But it was valid on the principle of Jas Receptum, that is, society had accepted it
 at: ek mat ke anusaar smriti ke kanoon kaa udgam samaaj hi he
 a part of it is moral order, the source of which is considered natural and the relic is tradition and virtue
 smritikaron ke vyaktitv evam sammaan tathaa suniti par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran smriti ke vachanon kii manyata hi inke vaidhanik vyadesh kaa praadhikaar he
 When the authentic version of Kautilya's Arthashastra was published, a controversy arose whether the legislative legislation in India was at any time more valid than the law declared by theology
 kautilya ne kaha he ki vidhaan chaar stambhon par aadhaarit he- Of these, the latter basis is more powerful than the preceding basis, but it is worth remembering that no fundamental order or practice alleged in theology by the royal edict was violated
 kautilya ne bhi saidhantik rup main yah sweekaar kiya tha ki rajanirmit vidhaan dharamshastra kii paridhi se baahar nahin he
 See, Legal Sociology 19veen shatabdi ke aarambh main francisi darshanik august kont ne soshiyalogy shabd kaa namakaran kiya
 Sociology is largely a study of society
 samajashastri ke adhyayan main vidhaan bhi sammilit he kintu uskaa drushtikon se bhinn he
 The lawyer, as advocate or adjudicator, sees the rules that the general public should emulate
 samajashastravetta yah dekhtaa he ki ye niyam kya hai
 To some extent both can follow, because in reality these rules are indicative of the desired character
 kintu samajashastravetta ko vaastavik charitra main adhik utsukata rahati he, vaanchit charitra ke vichaar main nahin
 Statutory sociology is also called criminology
 yah aparaadhon ke kaaran, aparaadhiyon ke charitra, vibhinn prakaar ke dandon kaa aparaadhiyon par prabhaav - visheshat: kahan tak dandon se aparaadh ke ghatane par prabhaav padataa he - in sab kaa adhyayan karata he
 This facilitates the reform of the law
 samand ke anusaar vidhishastra ke adhyayan kii apni abhyaantarik ruchi he jiske kaaran isaki tulana kisi gambhir gyaan kii shakha se kii ja sakati he
 In fact there is a natural attraction of inference and theory
 vidhishastrik anusandhan vidhik, raajnneetik, saamaajik aadi vichaaron ko prabhavit karte hai atev vidhishastra kaa adhyayan mahatvapurn he
 The study of jurisprudence increases the intensity of contemplation of human beings
 diase ke anusaar yah vidhi-vetta ko siddhanth or jivan prakaash laan kaa suavasar detaa he kyonki yah saamaajik vigyaan ke sambandh main maanav vichaaron par vichaar karata he
 Logical analysis of legal concepts leads to the development of logical method of legalists
 isse vidhivetta kii vyavsaayik praroopvaad kii buraai ko dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Dias believed that by developing life in the legal system, it gives inspiration to the genius of the scholar
 je ji philimor ne spasht kiya he ki vidhishastra kaa vigyaan itnaa ucch stareey he ki iskaa gyaan iske adhyeta ko gyanpurn avadharanaon or manovegon, jo maanav paristhitiyon main utpann sabhi apekshaaon main lagu ho sake, ke saath jivan main pravesh karaata he
 Laski evaluates the importance of jurisprudence and calls it the 'eye of the Law'
 vidhi kii badhati gutthiyon evam maanav sambandhon kii jatiltaaon ke niraakaran kaa rasta vidhishastra ke adhyayan main paaya ja saktaa he
 That is why it has been considered the grammar of the method
 aniruddh prasad ke anusaar vidhishastra kaa jaagruk adhyayan saamaajik samasyaon ke samaadhaan evam nyaay kii sarthakata ko avashyabhavi karata he
 The current jail reform, the expectation of human behavior with prisoners, the right to live with human dignity, social action litigation, and the investigation of public interest promises have arisen from the new legislative approach
 isi prakaar paryaavaran sudhaar vidhi, garibon k liye muft kanoonee sahaayta aadi vidhishastra or anya saamaajik vigyaanon kii antarvidya gyaan ke aadan-pradaan tathaa parsparik prabhaavon kii dein he
 Jurisprudence not only teaches the theoretical basis of the basic concepts of various branches of law, but also provides knowledge of their interrelationships
 vidhishastra keval vidhik pranali ke madhyam se nyaay prashasit hi nahin karata varan naveen siddhanton, vichaaron evam anya marga kii khoj ke madhyam se nyaaypurna samaaj kii sthapana main sahaayak hota he
 In the end, jurisprudence gives us a sense of the study, research and inference whose primary goal is the question of the commoner 


 "what is law"? Has to be answered
 vidhivetta kii drushti main kanoon un prabhaavon kii samshti he, jinke dwaara nyaayalayon main nirnay die jate hai
 The first goal of the law is to eliminate social conflicts, although all kinds of conflicts do not fall within this limit
 vidhivetta rasko pound ke anusaar kanoon kaa kaary yah he ki vah logon ke parsparik haq kaa santulan kare, jisase prayek vyakti ko adhiktam mili evam samaaj ke hit ke liye use nunatam tyaag karnaa pade
 Polar Jyoti, or Merujyoti, is the delightful lamp shade that appears in the upper part of the atmosphere of the pole regions
 uttari akshanshon kii dhruviya jyoti ko sumeru jyoti, yaa uttar dhruviya jyoti, tathaa dakshini akshanshon kii dhruviya jyoti ko kumeru jyoti, yaa dakshin dhruviya jyoti, kehete hai
 The ancient Romans and Greeks had knowledge of these events and have given a very interesting and detailed description of these scenes
 dakshin golardhwaalon ne kumeru jyoti kaa kuch spasht kaarnon se vaisaa vyapak or rochak varnan nahin kiya he, jaisaa uttari golardhavalon ne sumeru jyoti kaa kiya he
 From the description that is available to them, there is no doubt that there is a similarity between the two characteristics
 sumeru jyoti ke anek rup hote hai
 Stormer has classified them as follows: kiransanrachana pradarshit karanevaali jyoti - iske antargat corona kiran or tathakthith parichhad hai
 Jyoti, which does not display ray structure - contains samang chap, samang patta and vibrating pages
 vegord ne jyoti ko shant or chal roopon main vargeekrut kiya he
 Following is a brief description of the various Jyotis with symbols accepted by the International Earth and Geophysical Union: 1
 samang chaap ech e - inaki seemayen paryaapt spasht hoti hai
 They extend in some directions in the sky and the highest point of the arc is at the magnetic meridian

 It is clear from the word "khand Kavya" that only one event of human life prevails in it
 jisamen charit nayak kaa jivan sampoorn rup main kavi ko prabhavit nahin karata
 Poet Charitra, being influenced by some outstanding event in the life of the hero, inaugurates that particular section of life in his poetry

 Hence its plotline quickly ends to end like the story

 In fact, Khandakavya is a poetic poem whose plot has unitary discovery; The story should have a monologue and the narrative sequence should begin with development, culminate in the climax and definite purpose and be small in size
