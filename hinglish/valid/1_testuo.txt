 Caste is the most basic and lower class in the biological classification of organisms
 jeevvaigyanik nazariye se aise jeevon ke samooh ko ek jati bulaayaa jaataa he jo ek dusre ke saath santan utpann karne kii kshamta rakhte ho or jinaki santan swayan aage santan janane kii kshamta rakhti ho
 For example, a wolf and a lion cannot bear children among themselves, so they are considered to be of different castes
 ek ghoda or gadhaa aapas main baccha paidaa kar sakate hai, lekin kyonki khachchar aage baccha janane main asamarth hote hai, isliye ghode or gadhe bhi alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 In contrast, dogs are found in very different sizes, but any male dog and female dog can have children that are capable of producing offspring themselves
 isliye sabhi kute, chaahe ve kisi nasal ke hi kyon na hon, jeevvaigyanik drushti se ek hi jati ke sadsy samajhe jate hai
 Different castes having similarities with each other, in which the biologists believe that they originated from the same ancestor in the past and have been divided into different branches over time through evolution, are put into the same biological lineage is
 masalan ghode, gadhe or zebra alag jatiyon ke hai lekin teenon ek hi 'ekwas' vansh ke sadsy maane jate hai
 The definition of castes in modern times is also done by examining other aspects
 udhaaharan ke liye anuvanshiki kaa prayog karke aksar jeevon kaa di en e parkhaa jaataa he or is aadhaar par un jeevon ko ek jati ghoshit kiya jaataa he jinaki di en e chhap ek duusare se milti ho or duusare jeevon se alag ho
 The definition used for the term "caste" and reliable methods of identifying caste are essential for biological tests and assessment of biodiversity
 prastaavit jatiyon ke kai udaahranon kaa adhyayan aksharon ko jod kar kiya janaa chahie isse pehle kii yah ek jati maan lee jaae
 yah aam taur par un vilupt jatiyon ke liye sankshipt vargeekrut shrenee he jisaki jaankaree keval jeevashm se hi praapt karnaa mumkin he
 Some zoologists may view statistical phenomena as opposed to the traditional idea of the class of species observed in animals
 aisi sthiti main kisi jati ko pruthak rup se shaamil vansh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ekal jin pool kisanrachana karata he
 However, definitions such as dna-sequence and morphology, used to help isolate lineages that are highly related to each other, have clear limitations
 haalanki, "jati" shabd kii sateek paribhaasha abhi bhi vivaadaaspad he, visheshkar jeevakosh ke sambandh main, or yah jati samasya kehalaati he
 Biologists have given more detailed definitions, but there are only a few options used that depend on the characteristics of the respective castes
 aamtaur par istemaal kiye jane vaale paudhe or pashuon ke naam ko taxa kabhi-kabhi in jatiyon ke samaan hote hai: jaise, "sher", "walras," or "kapur kaa ped" - prayek jatiyon ko darshaate hai
 Other cases in which those names are not used: "deer" refers to a class of 34 castes, including eld deer, red deer, and reindeer
 baad vaali do jatiyon ko kabhi yah vyakhya karte hue ek hi jati mana jaataa tha ki vaigyanik gyaan badhane ke saath-saath jatiyon kii simaaen kitni parivartit ho sakati hai
 Due to the difficulties in defining both the world and calculating their total number, it is estimated that anywhere between two and 100 million / 2 to 100 million of this type can be different species
 adarsh rup main, kisi jati ko ek aupchaarik rup se vaigyanik naam diya jaataa he, haalanki vyavhaar main aisi bahut si jatiyaan hai 
 kisi jati kaa naam tab rakhaa jaataa he, jab ise vansh-varg / vansh-kram main rakhaa jaataa he
 From the scientific point of view, it can be considered a hypothesis that castes are much more related to the genus of other castes than to other lineages
 ek saamaanya jatiyon main shaamil he or / iske rup main sabase acha gyaat vargeekaran shrenee hai: jivan, kshetra, rajya, jati, varg, kram, parivaar, vansh or jati
 jinas ko iskaa nirdhaaran karnaa aparivarty nahin; koi vargeekaran vaigyanik baad main main ise bhinn jinas de saktaa he jis kaaran uskaa naam bhi badal jayega
 In biological nomenclature, a caste name has two parts, they are considered Latin, although the name and place of any native language or the name of a person can be used for it
 jati naam pehle ke baad doosraa shabd, vishesh naam soochibaddh he
 For example, the species known as the long-leaf pine is the genus Pinus palustris, whose brown wolves belong to the Canis lumpus, the Coytes canis latrans, the golden fox canis orus, and they all belong to the genus Canis
 Not only in other words, but caste names are completely bipedal

 At that time the main biological principle was that the freely represented species were originated by God and hence they are considered to be real and immutable, so that the hypothesis of common ancestry is not applicable
 pustakon or lekh main / inke sankshipt naam / rakhe jate hai or iske sankshipt naam ek vachan main "sp

 " ko vishesh naam par rakhaa jaataa he: udhaaharan ke liye, kenis sp
 aisa aamtaur par nimnlikhit sthitiyon main hota he: In books and articles, the names of genus and castes are usually printed in italics
 "sp
" or "spp
" kaa upyog karke inhen itelic nahin karnaa chahie
 It is astonishingly difficult to explain the term "caste" which applies to all natural beings and to biologists about how to interpret castes and how to identify real castes is called the caste problem
 adhikansh pathyapustakon main kisi jati "vaastavik or sambhavit antar nasl prakritik aabaadi vaale samooh" jo aise anya samooh prajnan ke taur par alag rakhe jate hai
 Various parts of this definition, such as some unusual or artificial intercourse, are excluded from it: uparokt adarsh pathyapustak vaali paribhaasha bahu-koshikeey praaniyon ke liye acchhee tarah kaary karti he lekin aisi bhi kuch paristhitiyaan hai jahaan par inhen anupyukt tehraaya ja saktaa he: Horizontal gene transfer makes the term "race" even more complicated to define
 prokerat samooh ke asmaan samoohon or or kam se kam aksar eukerets ke asmaan samoohon ke bich kshaitijiy jin sthanantaran ke majboot sakshya hai or williamson kaa tark he ki crustaciuns or ekinoderm main iske kuch sakshya uplabdh hai
 All definitions of the term "race" that all of their genes are derived from one or two parents are exactly the same as that animal, but basic gene transfer seems to be misconceived
 ek sabase badhiya prashn yah he "jati" shabd jisaki vyakhya jeev vigyaani dete aae hai or is charchaa ko jatiyon kii samasya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Darwin wrote in Chapter II of On the Origin of Species
 lekin baad main, darwin ne apni The Descent of Man main yah kehete hue apane mat main sanshodhan kiya ki "kya maanav main ek yaa anek jatiyaan shaamil hai"
 The modern theory of development rests on new fundamental definitions of "caste"
 darwin se pehle, prakrutivaadiyon ne jatiyon ko adarsh yaa saamaanya prakaar ke rup main dekha, jiskaa udhaaharan kisi adarsh namoonay ke saath diya ja saktaa he jisamen saamaanya jati ke samaan ve sabhi gun uplabdh hai
 The uniformity of Darwin's theory shifted attention from the simple to the special
 bauddhik itihaaskaar louis minand ke anusaar, It transforms "caste" into a new approach; Darwin vyaavhaarik rup se, jeev vigyaniyon ne jatiyon ko paribhaashit praaniyon kii aabaadi jinamein anuvanshik samanta kaa str ucch hota he ke rup main kii he
 It can reflect the adaptation of the same organism and transfer varieties of genetic material from one potential to another
 is prakaar kii paribhaasha main samanta ke sateek str kaa uprayog ekapaksheeya hota he, lekin yah praaniyon ke liye upyog kii jane vaali sabase aam paribhaasha he jisase alangik prajnan hota he, jiseki kuch paudhe or sookshm praani
 The lack of any apparent caste deficiency in microbiology has led some authors to argue that the use of the term "caste" is not correct when studying bacteria
 iske bajaay unhone jin ko dur-daraaj se sambandhit bacteria ko sambandhit bacteria ko sampurna bacteria sambandhi kshetra ko ek jin vaale pool ke saath swatantra rup se vichrate hue dekhte hai
 Nevertheless, the rule of thumb was established stating that more than 97% of the same 16S rrna gene sequence bacteria or Archaea should be examined by DNA – DNA hybridization regardless of whether they belong to the same species
 is avadharana kaa adhyatan haal hi main yah kehete hue kiya gaya he ki 97% kii seemaa bhi bahut kam thi or use 98
7% tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Sexually borne organisms, where the genetic material is shared in the reproductive process, then the interbreeding process of the two animals and the hybrid offspring of both sexes are accepted as equal indicators that the animals have shared the same species
 Has adopted abundant genes as a member of
 ek prakaar se "jati" antar prajnan praaniyon kaa ek samooh he
 This definition can be extended further by stating that a caste is a group of animals capable of potentially interbreeding breeding - fish can be kept in the same species even if they live in different lakes because they Interracial breeding can occur if they have ever come in contact with each other
 On the other hand, there are many examples of three or more bizarre populations of whether animals with intercultural populations can breed interculturally in other types of populations, but on the other hand, these populations are not capable of interbreeding
 is prakaar se, yah vishay bahes yogya he ki ye aabaadiyaan ek yaa do alag-alag jatiyaan banaati hai
 There is no contradiction in that species are defined based on gene frequencies and thus have ambiguous boundaries
 natijatan, "jati" kii saarvbhaumik paribhaasha aavashyak rup se ekapaksheeya he
 Instead, biologists have given many definitions; The use of which is the perfect choice for any zoologist depends on the characteristics of that zoologist's research
 abhyaas main, ye paribhaashaayen samaan hai or unke bich ekamusth virodhabhas kii tulana main unka maamla adhik mahatvapurn he
 Nevertheless, none of the concepts of caste proposed so far are fully objective or can apply in all cases without assistance for a decision
 jivan kii jatilta ko dekhte hue, kuch kaa kahana he ki is tarah ke ek uddeshy kii paribhaasha sabhi prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon main asambhav he or jeev vaigyanikon ko sabase adhik vyaavhaarik paribhaasha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 It is the concept of all biological species in most spineless animals and is largely deficient in the phylogenetic race
 kai BSC up-jatiyon ko PSC ke antargat jati mana jaataa he; BSC or PSC ke bich antar kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he kyonki BSC jati ko spasht vikasvaadi itihaas ke parinamswaroop jati ko paribhaashit karata he, jabaki PSC kisi jati ko spasht vikasvaadi sambhaavna ke parinamswaroop paribhaashit karata he
 In this way, the PSC castes were "created" as soon as the evolutionary lineage began to be separated, while the BSC caste began to emerge only when their lineage separation was complete
 tadnusaar, PSC banaam BSC ke aadhaar par vaikalpik vargeekaran ke bich paryaapt vivaad sambhav he kyonki unke taxa ke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par ve bilkul bhinn hai, use baad vaale model ke antargat up-jatiyaan maanya hongi
 Life-supporting castes: Many castes are absolutely bizarre towards adaptation to the environment, as they are capable of yielding or breeding under certain conditions such as drought, desertification, flooding, soil poisoning, soil salinity, many of which are food
 , Providing materials and empowering humans, livestock and other animals are considered potentially beneficial to humans A
 These are known as life-supporting nations

 professor james melette ke anusaar ham nai jatiyon kii khoj ke baavjood maamalon ko bad se badtar banaate ja rahe hai or ham in jatiyon ko abhootpurv gati ke saath samaapt karte ja rahe hai
 It also means that it must be studied and classified before acquiring a new race, since it may have already become extinct
 jatiyon kii dharna kaa lanbaa itihaas he
 This is one of the most important levels of classification for several reasons: varshon ke prayog ke baad, jeev vigyaan kii avadharana or sambandhit kshetra ke mejabaan ke rup main pramukh rahi he lekin abhi tak ise purna rup se paribhaashit nahin kii gai he
 The nomenclature of a particular caste should be considered hypotheses about the evolutionary relationship and diversity of the organisms of that group
 agrim jaankaree haath main aate hi pariklpana kii pushti yaa uskaa khandan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes, especially when communication was much more difficult in the past, classification scientists working on segregation gave different names to different animals that were later identified as a common race
 jab do naam vaali jati kii khoj ek jati ke rup main kii gai, to puraani jati kaa naam aamtaur se kaayam rakhaa gaya or nai jati ke naam ko vah naam de diya gaya, ek aisi prakriya jo ekatrikaran ke rup main paryaayavacheekaran yaa bolchaal kii prakriya kehalaati he
 The division of a texon into more than one is usually called a texon
 vargeekaran vaigyanikon ko aamtaur se unke sahpaathiyon dwaara unhen "lanpar" yaa "splitre" kaha jaataa he, jo jantuon ke bich pahachaane jane vaale antar par unke vyaktigat drushtikon or samaantaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Traditionally, researchers have relied on the observation of structural differences and the observation of whether or not their differential reproduction was successfully carried out for differences in castes in different populations; Both anatomy and reproductive behavior are still important to state the status of castes
 pichley kuch dashakon main, sookshmjeevigyaani anusandhan takanic main kranti ke parinamswaroop jaise DNA vishleshan se jatiyon ke bich antar or samaantaaon ke bare main athaah gyaan uplabdh ho gaya he
 Many populations formerly considered as separate castes are now considered a taxon and the pre-grouped population is divided
 koi vargeekaran str kaa paryaayavacheekaran yaa vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or ucch texonomik str par ye sanshodhan abhi bhi bahut athaah hai
 From the classification point of view, groups in race can be defined more as Texon classification than race
 praanivigyaan main keval up-jatiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jabaki vanaspati vigyaan main vividhta, up-vividhta or swaroop kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 In conservation biology, the evolutionary critical unit is used that can be defined as a segment with a caste or more small bizarre population
 vigyaan ke praarambhik kaary main, jati keval alag-alag praani hote the jo apane samaan yaa lagbhag samaan praaniyon ke samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 At that time no other relations were applicable to them
 arestu ne jinas or jati shabd kaa upyog jatigat yaa vishesh virgon ke liye kiya
 Aristotle and other pre-darwinian scientists considered castes to be special and immutable as chemical elements such as "essence"
 When the early observers began to develop the organization as a system for organisms, they began to place the segregated space beforehand
 inamen se kai praarambhik chithran yojanaon ko ab sanakee nahin mana jayega or inamen samarktata ke aadhaar par rang yaa vyavhaar shaamil hai
 In the 18th century, Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus classified organisms according to reproductive organs
 haalanki jeevon ke vargeekaran ke unke prakaar ne samanta ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya, lekin unhone samaan jatiyon ke bich sambandh ke bare main koi daawa nahin kiya
 
 At that time, it was still widely believed that no one among the castes believed that there was any biological connection between the biological castes, no matter how similar they looked
 This approach also suggested a kind of idealism: the notion that all the existing castes are an "ideal form"
 haalanki vahaan par sabhi jeevon ke bich hameshaa hi matbhed hai, to bhi linius ne aise antar ko samasyapurna mana
 unhone alag-alag jeevon kii pahchaan karne kaa prayaas kiya jo jatiyon kaa anukaraniya tha or anya gaiyr-anukaraniya jeevon asaamaanya or apurna mana
 By the 19th century most naturalists understood that caste could change from time to time, and that the history of the home gave enough time for major changes in them
 jin-baptist lamark ne Zoological Philosophy main sristi-rachana-siddhant ke viruddh pehla taarkik vichaar diya
 There was a new preference for determining how castes might change over time
 lamark ne suzav diya ki jeev kisi praapt gun ko apane aane vaale vansh main pahunchaa saktaa he jaise jiraph kii lambii gardan oonche pedo kii pattiyon tak pahunchnaa jiraph kii peedi kaa gun tha
 However, with Charles Darwin's acceptance of the natural selection idea in 1860, Lanmark's approach to goal-oriented development, also known as the teleological process, was rendered ineffective
 pashchjanan sambandhi prakriyaayein jaise mithailation ke aas-paas praapt visheshtaon ke vanshanukram main haal hi kii ruchi jo DNA kram ko prabhavit nahin karti, lekin viraasatiya tareeke se abhivyakti ko badla ja saktaa he
 Thus, neo-lamarckism, as it has sometimes been talked about, that the theory of evolution is not a challenge with natural selection
 charles darwin or alfred veles vah vichaar diya jiskaa paalan aaj bhi vaigyanik vikaas ke siddhant kaa sabase shaktishaalee or sammohak rup main karte hai
 Darwin argued that this included population was not just a creature
 unka tark linius kii kattarpanthi dhara ke pariprekshya kii tulana main adhik vishwasaneey he:jati kii vyakhya adarsh shabd ke rup main karne kii bajaay, darwin ne jeevon ke bich antar ko prakritik mana
 unhone aage tark diya ki samasyagrastata se dur durlabh jati ke astitv ke liye vastav main uskaa spashtikaran kiya
 Darwin's work drew on Thomas Malthus' insight that the growth rate of organic populations would always be ahead of the growth rate of resources in the environment, such as the supply of food
 As a result, Darwin argued that not all organisms in the population would be able to subsist and breed
 unke dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary ausatan lekin unamem antar hoga - haalanki ve use thodaa bahut paryaavaran ke anukool banaaenge
 agar ye gunon vaale antar paitruk rahe to jivit rahane waalon kaa vansh unhen dhaaran kar legaa
 In this way, adaptive variations will accumulate in the population over many generations, while the hostile traits will disappear
 is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki kya paryaavaran main koi antar anukuli he yaa gaiyr anukuli: bhinn-bhinn paryaavaran alag alag gunon kaa paksh lete hai
 Because the environment effectively chooses which creature to survive for reproduction and it is the environment that determines which qualities should go forward
 yah prakritik chayan ke dwaara vikaas kaa siddhant he
 In this model, the neck length of a giraffe would be interpreted according to the situation that the long-necked proto-giraffe acquired special reproductive traits from the short-necked giraffe
 For many generations, the entire population would have belonged to long-necked animals
 
 1859 main, jab darwin ne prakritik chayan kaa apana siddhant prakashit kiya, to us samay vanshanukram ke vyaktigat gunon vaale tantra kaa gyaan nahin tha
 Although Darwin made some assumptions about inheritance of virtue, his theory was based only on the fact that inheritance properties exist and are mutable
 haalanki grager mendal anuvanshiki par shodh-patr ko uski visheshtaon kii pahchaan kiye bina hi 1866 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This was not done until 1900 when his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Verais, Carl Correns, and Erick von Semark, when they realized that Darwin's theory had "inherited properties" genes
 prakritik chayan ke madhyam se vikaas kii jatiyon ke vargeekaran main jatiyon kii charchaa ke liye do mahatvapurn manyataayen he - ve parinaam lineyas kii texonomi ke paksh main anumaanon ko moolbhoot rup se chunauti detii hai
 At first it showed that castes are not only the same but they can also be really related
 darwin ke kuch chaatro kaa tark he ki sabhi jatiyaan aam purvaj kii vanshaj hai
 Second, it is assumed that "caste" is not homogeneous, stable, permanent things; Caste members are completely different and castes have changed a long time ago
 is baat se pataa chalata he ki jatiyon kii koi vishesh seemaa kshetra nahin he lekin lagaataar badalati jin-aavritiyon ke sankhyikeey prabhaav padate hai
 Still, one can use the classification of Linnaeus to identify plants and animals, but no one can think of an independent and immutable form of castes anymore
 paitruk vansh se kisi nai jati main vikaas hona speshiation kehalaata he
 The progeny caste has no clear lineage demarcation from its descendant caste
 haalanki jatiyon ke vartmaan vaigyanik gyaan se yah pataa chalaa he ki sabhi maamalon main vibhinn jatiyon ke bich antar sthapit karne ke liye koi thos or vyapak tarika nahin he, taaki jeev vigyaani is vichaar ke sanchaalan ko jari rakhane ke liye thos tareekon kii talash jari rakhen
 jati ke bare main sabase lokapriy jaivik paribhaasha main se ek prajnan algaav ke sandarbh main he, agar do praani donon lingon ke sankar vansh kaa prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hote, to ve bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke hote hai
 Intuitive castes have limitations in this definition, but are incomplete
 udhaaharan ke liye un jati ke bare main kuch nahin kahana he jo alangik tareeke se prajnan karte hai or use vilupt hoti ja raheen jatiyon par lagu karnaa bada mushkil he
 In addition, the boundaries between castes are often unclear: there are instances where members of a particular population breed fertile hybrid offspring of creatures from a second population and members of a second population cultivate fertile hybrids from creatures with a third population
 Can breed offspring but members of the first and third populations cannot breed fertile hybrids or only fertile offspring from parents Birth is possible
 natijatan, kuch log jati kii is paribhaasha ko asweekaar karte hai
 Richard Dakins describes the two organisms as homogeneous and if they have the same number of chromosomes and for each chromosome, both creatures have the same number of chromosomes
 However, most all classification scientists will disagree with this point
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai ubhaycharon main, vishesh rup se newjiland main, leopelma mendhakon ke jinom main "mul" jinom hote hai jo bilkul bhinn nahin hote or gaun gunasutra hote hai jo bahut se sanyojanon main maujuud hai
 Although extreme differences are found in the number of chromosomes of the population, they can successfully differentiate and form a single developmental unit
 paudhon main, poliflidi antar prajnan par kuch rokthaamon vaala atyadhik saamaanya sthaan he; kyonki praaniyon ke gunasutron ke set sam sankhya se visankramit kiye jate hai, jo vartmaan gunasutron ke set kii vaastavik sankhya par nirbhar karata he jahaan vahi vikaskaari ikai ke kuch praani kuch anya ke saath antar prajnan kar sakate hai or kuch nahin or usamen puri aabaadi ko visheshtaur se ek saamaanya jin pool banane ke rup main joda gaya he
 Classification of species is particularly affected by technological advances that allowed researchers to link their evidence based on molecular traces, to acute evidence of crude blood plasma, in the mid-20th century ground-breaking DNA-DNA hybridization study of Charles Sibley, In 1970, the comparison gave rise to DNA sequencing techniques
 in takneekon ke parinamswaroop ucch texonomik virgon main krantikari parivartan aayaa, jisase filogenetic ped kii bahut si shakhaon kii punarvyavastha vaale parinaam praapt hue

 The turtle was determined to develop at the molecular level with only one-eighth of the speed of other reptiles, and the rate of molecular evolution in albatross is found to be only half that of storum-petrels
 aajkal aprachlit sankaran takanic uplabdh he or anukram kii tulana ke liye or adhik vishwasaneey computesnal drushtikon dwaara badali jaati he
 Molecular taxonomy is not directly based on evolutionary processes, but overall changes are made by these processes
 ve prakriyaayein jo peedi or vividhta vaale rakrakhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai jaise parivartan, badlaav kii prakriya or chayan samroop nahin hai
 DNA is only the rarer direct target of natural selection rather than a change in DNA sequence during generations on the latter outcome; For example, the silent transit-substitution combination would alter the melting point of the DNA sequence, but not the sequence of the encoded protein, and for example where for microorganisms, the changes in themselves consider changes in their fitness

 To turn an engine, it has to be rotated with a handle on its main axis, or with a battery-powered electromotor

 In diesel engines, the suction power piston draws only air, not fuel; At the start of the power ambush, the fuel is released into the cylinder by force, with the help of a pump, and it burns without any spark, due to the heat of the compressed air

 India is a vast country of many languages - Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu in the northwest; Oriya in the east, Assamese in Bengal; Marathi and Gujarati in the mid-west and Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam in the south
 inke atirikt katipay or bhi bhashaaen hai jinka saahitiyik evam bhashavaigyanik mahatva kam nahin he- jaise kashmiri, dogri, sindhi, konkani, turu aadi
 Each of these, especially each of the first twelve languages, has its own literature which is extremely rich in terms of antiquity, diversity, quality and magnitude

 bharat kii prayek bhashaa ke sahitya kaa apana swatantra or prakhar vaishishty he jo apane pradesh ke vyaktitv se mudrankit he
 How much the state borders of Punjabi and Sindhi, Hindi and Urdu are found here! But what makes the specialty of their literature so special! Similarly, the life of Gujarati and Marathi is intertwined, but is there any possible confusion between them! The origins of the languages of the South are one: all are variations of the Dravidian family, but can there be doubt as to the formulation of Kannada and Malayalam or Tamil and Telugu formations! The same is true of Bengali, Assamese and Oriya
 bengaal ke gahare prabhaav ko pachaakar asamiya or oriya apane swatantra astitv ko banaaye hue hai
 All these literatures have their own distinct personalities

 The essence and diversity of Indian literature is unique, its originality is even more delightful

 In the Oriya language, the thirteenth century certainly begins to have satirical poetry and folklore

 Similarly, systematic literature starts to be available in Punjabi and Hindi from the eleventh century

 However, some scholars have begun to believe that Urdu originated from the compositions of Baba Farid, Abdullah Hameed Nagori and Amir Khusro of the 13-14th century

 Astronomy The study of the light, origin, structure and behavior of celestial bodies located in the universe is a matter of astronomy
 ab tak brahmad ke jitne bhaag kaa pataa chalaa he usamen lagbhag 19 arab akaash gangaaon ke hone kaa anumaan he or prayek akaash ganga main lagbhag 10 arab taare hai
 The diameter of Akash Ganga is about one lakh light years
 hamaari prithvi par aadim jeev 2 arab saal pehle paidaa hua or aadmi kaa dharti par avatan 10-20 lakh saal pehle hua
 According to scientists, the universe originated from the explosion of a superpower
 surya ek ausat tara he jiske nau mukhya grah hai, unamem se prithvi bhi ek he
 Every star in this universe is like the Sun
 bahut-se taare to aise hai jinke saamne apana surya anu ke baraabar bhi nahin thahartaa he
 Just as there are planets of the Sun and we all call them together in the name of Solar family, similarly each star has its own family

 In view, the stars of the Ganges seem to be interconnected, but this vision is illusion
 ek duusare se sate hue taron ke bich kii duuri arabon mile ho sakati he
 When this is the condition of contiguous stars, then the distance between the wires located far away is such a calculation that it is difficult to say
 isi kaaran se taaraon ke bich tathaa anya lambii dooriyaan prakashavarsh main maapi jaati hai
 a light year is the distance that the distance light travels in a year at a speed of one lakh twenty six thousand thousand miles per second
 udhaaharan ke liye surya or prithvi ke bich kii duuri sava nau karod mile he, prakaash yah duuri sava aath minute main tay karata he
 Thus, the distance of the Sun from Earth was a quarter to eight light minutes
 jin taron se prakaash aath hajaar varshon main aata he, unki duuri hamane paune santalis padam mile aanki he
 But the stars are so far away that it takes millions, crores, billions of years for light to come from them
 is sthiti main hamen in duriyon ko milon main vyakt karnaa sambhav nahin hoga or na kuch samaj main hi aayega
 That's why scientists have used the unit of light year

 Thus Hubble's observations revealed that the sky Ganges is going away from us
 habal ne yah bhi bataaya ki unki prithvi se dur hatane kii gati, prithvi se unki duuri ke anupaat main he
 Astronomers have observed the extinction of the galaxy from the telescope of a 200-inch diameter lens located at Mount Polomer Observatory
 doorabeen se brahmad ko dekhne par hamen aisa prathit hota he ki ham is brahmad ke centrebindu hai or baaki chijen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 If observers are sent to other sky Ganges, they will also find that they are the focal point of this universe, the rest of the sky Ganges are running away from us
 ab jo sahi chitra hamaare saamne aata he, vah yah he ki brahmad kaa samaan gati se vistaar ho rahaa he

 lekin phir bhi ainstin ke siddhant ko soramandal sambandhi nirikshanon par aadhaarit nishkarshon kii vyakhya karne main newton ke siddhanton se adhik safalataa praapt hui thi
 According to Newton, the transpiration force between the two bodies has an immediate effect on each other, but Einstein proved that the speed of reciprocal transpiration power cannot be as fast as the speed of light
 aakhir yahan par ainstin ne newton ke patr ko galat pramanit kiya
 People liked Einstein's theory

 According to this belief, the universe has originated from the explosion of a Mahapind and that is why the Ganges of the sky is running away from us

 Template: Grammatical categories Grammatical tense is a periodic linguistic quality expressing any position or time of a verb, by, during, or beyond the verb
 kaal bhav, awaz or pahalu ke saath, chaar gunon main se kam se kam ek he, jo abhivyakti spasht kar sakate hai
 Tenses reflect the contrast of occasional references to the development of an expression
 sabhi bhashaaen samaan kaal istemaal karti hai - vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya, haalanki hameshaa in kaalon kii abhivyakti kaa anuwaad spasht rup se ek bhashaa se duusari bhashaa main nahin kiya ja saktaa
 jabaki sabhi bhashaaon main kriya ke theth rup hote hai jiske dwaara ve shabdkoshon main pahachaane jate hai or krambaddh kiye jate hai, saadharantah sabase aam vartmaan kaal yaa ek saadhaaran rup, unke kaal abhivyakt karne ke tareekon kaa istemaal, bhashaaon ke bich bhinn he
 There are some languages in which tense is not interlinked through the verb form nor expressed structurally, but instead, whenever needed, the underlying adverb is intertwined with the use of adjectives and some contain topical information
 Appears by the use of intransitive adjectives
 kuch bhashaaon main pahalu or kaal par ek saath sanket karne ke liye ek ekal kriya antahkunchit kii ja sakati he
 The number of tenses in a language can be disputed, as the tense noun is often mistaken for displaying occasional expressions, extra facets and even expressions
 kai granthon main, kaal shabd galati se anischitata, aavruti, nishpatti, avadhi, sambhaavna kii gunvattta ko sanderbhit karata he or yahan tak ki ise bhi ki kya jaankaree anubhav se vyutpann hoti he yaa afvaah se 
 yah vastav main kaal nahin hai, lekin paramparaagat namapaddati aksar unka aise vargeekaran karti he
 In reality, all languages have the same tenses
 ye aam taur par teen samoohon main vibhajit hote hai - vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya, jisamen ek nirdhaarit abhipraay main prayek shrenee baddh hota he
 For example, past tenses are those in which the occasional reference to the component verb occurs before the occasional reference to the statement itself
 bhoot kaal, saamaanya ateet / bhoot se lekar tatkaal ateet / bhoot, sudur yaa dur sudur ateet / bhoot tak bhi shrenee baddh ho saktaa he, inke bich sirf ek hi antar hota he or vah he, samayik sandarbh binduon ke bich ghatnakram par duuri
 In English, tense is divided into two types of groups - pure tense and verb tense
 Pure tense refers to the manifestations of the present, past and future in which the secondary topical context is considered absolutely certain or known
 duusare shabdon main, shuddh kaal un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein anupramann sach mana yaa janaa jaataa he
 On the other hand, verb gesture refers to the manifestations of present, past, or future in which the certainty of attestation is not completely certain
 angrezi main yah rup ek kriyabhaav dyotak, kriyabhaav dyotak kahawat yaa kriyabhaav dyotak kriya-visheshan jodne se abhivyakt kiye jate hai
 The past tense is expressed only in English by subtracting the verb
 sabhi kachche or achook pahaluon main, bhoot kaal pheravat rup main abhimukhataa poorak, tha / the, hona ) ke paroksh rup ke istemaal se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 In non-periodic aspects, the past tense can be expressed through a particular intransitive form in which the component verb has been used indirectly, except for the aspectual complement 'done'
 yah rup keval kuch hi sakaaratmak vyakhyanon main sambhav he
 In all other types of utterances, the inflection form must be employed
 vartmaan kaal bhoot kaal ke saamaan ek achihnit rup ke dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he, lekin isamen abhimukhataa poorak keval pheravat roopon main vyakti or sankhya he / hai, he / he ) ke saath samjhaute ke liye hi manaa kiye jate hai
 Interpreted forms, as with past tense, can be used for some positive lectures
 angrezi main shuddh bhavishya kaal vartmaan kaal kii tarah hi abhivyakt kiya jaataa he lekin ek bhavishya -chihnak kriya-visheshan yaa samay padbandh ke saath
 In English, the adverb denotative tense is expressed either by the use of a fully accepted adverb denotative form or by an additional adverb denotative adverb or a pure tense form with a phrase
 In English, the verb dative sign is most often used to express the future tense
 kriyabhaav dyotak bhavishya aath bhavishya roopon main se kisi ko bhi sanderbhit karata he jisamen bhavishya parinaamon ke anishchit swaroop ke kaaran anupramann ko sach nahin kaha ja saktaa
 yah rup nischitata ke hisaab se bhinn hote hai or hameshaa ek sahaayak manodasha ke abhipraay ke bheetar bhavishya nischitata kaa vah str abhivyakt karte hai
 The following list shows examples of tense expressions in some indo-european and finno-arjic periods using the verb "go"
 kaal mote taur par vartmaan, bhoot, yaa bhavishya ke rup main vargeekrut kiye gaye hai
 Several possible periods exist within these broad classifications
 in kaalon ke bich antar mukhya rup se kathan ke samay se samayik duuri kii degree kaa he
 For example, within the general category of the past tense, the immediate past, the distant past, the distant past and the distant past may exist, the difference being only the increase in the distance from the time of the narration to the narration
 kuch bhashaaen keval bhoot, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bich hi bhed nahin karti, balki gair-bhoot, gair-vartmaan, gair-bhavishya ke bich main bhi
 baad ke donon kaal pehle ke do sammilit karte hai, bina spasht kiye ki ve koun sa kar rahe hai
