 naastik log ishwar ke astitv kaa spasht pramaan na hone kaaran jhooth qaraar dete hai
 Most atheists do not believe in any deity, supernatural power, religion and soul
 hindu darshan main naastik shabd unke liye bhi prayukt hota he jo vedon ko manyata nahin dete
 Atheists believe in knowing rather than believing
 vahiin aastik kisi na kisi ishwar kii dharna ko apane dharm, sampradaay, jati, kul yaa mat ke anusaar bina kisi pramanikta ke sweekaar karata he
 Atheism calls it superstition because no two religions and beliefs have the same belief in God

 Many scientific and talented people like Ambedkar, Bernat Russell consider Buddhism as a scientific religion

 darshan kaa anishvarwad ke anusaar jagat swayan sanchalit or swayan shasit he
 The atheists criticize all of them by giving proof for the existence of God, and try to prove that the creator of such a world cannot be a God by following the following types of arguments explaining the worldly faults
 ishwarwadi kehete he ki manushya ke man main ishvarpratyay janm se hi he or vah swayansiddh evam anivaary he
 It signifies the existence of God
 iske uttar main anishvaravaadi kehete hai ki ishvarbhaavana sabhi manushyon main anivaary rup se nahin pai jaati or yadi pai bhi jaati ho to keval man kii bhaavana se bahari vastuon kaa astitv siddh nahin hota
 Many concepts of mind have been proved imperfect by science
 jagat main sabhi vastuon kaa kaaran hota he
 There is no work without reason
 kaaran do prakaar ke hote hai-ek upadan, jiske dwaara koi vastu banati he or doosraa nimitt, jo usko banaata he
 The theologians say that the whole world is also a work like a clock, a board and a clock, and so should be the cause of gratitude and purpose
 kuch log ishwar ko jagat kaa nimitt kaaran or kuch log nimitt or upadan donon hi kaaran maanate hai
 In response to this tactic, the atheist says that we have no proof that the entire world, like ghat, pat and clock, was also generated and started at some time
 iskaa pravaah anadi he, at: iske srashta or upadan kaaran ko foundne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 If the creator of the world is accepted as a God who will face many difficulties; As such, what was the purpose in creating it? How can physical creation only do mental or spiritual power? If its substance is accepted as a physical substance, then how can it control it? He himself works with the help of physical body or equipment or without his help? Where did those tools and that physical body come from without creation? What is the purpose of God by creating such a creation, which his devotees consider to be omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent, in which the end of life is in death, the end of happiness, in sadness, in dissociation, and in decadence of progress? What is the benefit of creating this sad world, where the organism lives by eating the organism, and where all the beings are enemies to each other and all the beings struggle among themselves? The plight of this world is well described in one verse of Yogavashistha, sirf isliye ki vigyaan prayog main, samajha nahin saktaa jaise pyaar jo kavita likhane ke liye kavi ko prerit karata he, iskaa arth yah nahin he ki dharm kar saktaa he
 It is a simple and logical fallacy to say that, 'if science cannot do something, religion can

 yah baat isaki dyotak he ki iskaa sanchaalan karanevaala koi budhimaan ishwar he is yukti kaa anishvarwad is prakaar khandan karata he ki sansar main bahut si ghatnaayen aisi bhi hoti hai jinka koi uddeshy, athwa kalyankari uddeshy nahin jaan padataa, yatha ativrishti, anaavrishti, akaal, baadh, aag lag janaa, akalmrityu, jaraa, vyaadhiyaan or bahut se hinsak or dusht praani
 The more rules and unity visible in the world, the more irregularity and opposition can be seen
 inkaa kaaran foondnaa utana hi aavashyak he jitna niyamon or aikya kaa
 Just as a king or state administration controls all people in society in behavior towards one another, similarly there is a need for a God who rules over all creatures of the world and to torture, punish and reward them for sin and virtue
 iske uttar main anishvaravaadi yah kahata he ki sansar main prakritik niyamon ke atirikt or koi niyam nahin dikhaai padate
 The distinction between sin and virtue is false which man has made out of his mind
 yahan par sab kriyaaon kii pratikriyaayein hoti rahati hai or sab kaamon kaa lekha baraabar ho jaataa he
 No other regulator and ruler is required for this
 yadi paap or punya ke liye dand or puraskaar kaa prabandh hota tathaa unako rokane or karaanevaala koi ishwar hota; or puneatmaon kii raksha hua karti tathaa papatmaon ko dand mila karata to isamsih or gandhi jaise puneatmaon kii nrushans hatya na ho paati
 In this way, atheism denies theistic axioms and even says that if one is to be the creator of such a world, then only the wicked and foolish devil will have to be believed, not the wise and benevolent God
 paashchaatya darshanikon main anek anishvaravaadi ho gaye hai or hai
 Jain, Buddhist, Charvak, Sankhya and Purvimamsa philosophies are atheistic philosophies in India

 atah ishwar sirf janata kaa opium hota he

 jo log veda ko param pramaan nahin maanate ve naastik kehalaate hai
 According to this definition, the followers of Buddhist, Jain and Lokayat schools are called atheists and these three philosophies do not believe in God or Vedas, hence they are called atheist philosophies
 jo log paralok or mrityupashchaat jivan main vishwaas nahin karte; is paribhaasha ke anusaar keval charvak darshan jise lokayat darshan bhi kehete hai, bharat main naastik darshan kehalaata he or uske anuyaayi naastik kehalaate hai
 Those who do not believe in the existence of God
 ishwar main vishwaas na karanevaale naastik kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Extreme atheists are those who do not believe in any form of God
 charvak matvaale bharat main or rank athist log paashchaatya deshen main ishwar kaa astitv kisi rup main sweekaar nahin karte; ardhanasti unka kah sakate hai jo ishwar kaa sristi, paalan or sanhaarkarta ke rup main nahin maanate
 According to this definition, many philosophies of India fall under the category of atheists
 vastav main nyaay or vedant darshanon ko chhodkar bharat ke anya darshan sankhya, yoga, vaisheshik, buddha or jain naastik darshan kahe ja sakate hai kyonki inamen ishwar ko sarjak, paalak or vinaashak nahin mana gaya he
 Only such atheists are called atheists

 During the middle of the 20th century the wild Siberian tiger population had almost disappeared, so it is also possible that the Siberian tiger that bears the white colored pitrac may have died during this period
 More research is still needed by scientists to fully understand the genetic structure of Siberian tigers

 An additional genetic condition can remove most of the white tiger stripes, making this animal almost pure white
 One such specimen was exhibited at the Exeter Change in England in 1820 and was described by Georges Cuvier as, "A white variety of tiger is sometimes seen with fairly blurred stripes and certain angles of light
 Except these stripes are not visible from any other angle
 " The naturalist Richard Ledecker stated that, "in 1820, the old manger of Exeter Change featured a white tiger with a cream-like tint of hair, as well as stripes in its parts usually appearing blurred

 These are probably orange tigers that carry a stripe-less white pitrack as a repulsive pitrack
 bharat ke kuch safed baagh safed or naarangi ke rang ke bich ke rang ke or bahut gahare rang ke hote hai
 Contrary to popular belief, white tigers are not discolored because the actual discolored tigers do not have stripes

 Due to a visual pathway abnormality that causes some visual nerves to move in the wrong direction of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation and their vision continues to blunt until they learn to compensate
 Some tigers compensate by skewing their eyes

 They let the solar beam go through a prism to the curtain, coming from a window hole in a closed room
 parde par saat rangon par bangnee rang tha
 Seven colors in the bandage - red, orange, yellow, green, sky, blue and purple - were visible in this order
 newton ne is pattee ko "spectrum" kaha
 With this experiment he proved that the white light of the sun is actually a mixture of seven colors
 bahut samay tak "spectrum" kaa arth isi satarangi pattee se hi lagaaya jaataa tha
 Later, scientists noticed that even under the violet color of the solar spectrum, some rocks are found which are not visible by the eye but affect the photoplat and can be photographed
 in kirnon ko parabangnee kirane kaha jaataa he
 Similarly, infrared rays are found above red color
 vastav main sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan vidyut chumbakeey tarangen hoti hai

 The "spectrum" that Newton obtained from the sun's rays was not pure, meaning that all colors were not completely separate from the nearby colors; One color was mixed with another
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki unhone kirnon ko ek gol chhed se lekar prism par daalaa tha
 In 1802 AD, Wollaston obtained pure spectrum by using narrow wrinkles in place of round holes
 aage chalakar joseph frounhophar ne prism kii sahaayta se shuddh spectrum praapt kiya or samtal grating kaa avishkaar kiya
 Grating is another device that reflects the colors of different colors

 In 1859, Kirkhaf and Bunashan took a spectrum of many pure elements and stated that they are completely different from each other
 kirkhof or bunshan ne yah bhi siddh kiya ki koi padaarth uttejit hone par jis varna kii rashmiyaan de saktaa he, kam taap par keval usee varna kii rashmiyaan de saktaa he, kam taap par keval usee varna kii rashmiyon ko avashoshit bhi kar saktaa he
 After knowing these elements, the progress of spectroscopy took place with great intensity
 is vigyaan ne anu parmaanuon kii rachana kaa gyaan praapt karaane main mahattam yogadan kiya he
 a substance is stimulated by giving it electricity or heat, then light comes out from it
 us padaarth se nikalanevaali rashmiyon kaa spectrum uski aantarik rachana par nirbhar karata he
 If a solid substance is heated enough that it starts glowing intensely, the spectrum it receives is called a continuous spectrum, because the strips of different characters are mixed with each other, there is no limit
 bijli ke balb tathaa surya se aisa hi spectrum praapt hota he
 Conversely, if a substance is given so much energy that its atoms get excited, it gives a linear spectrum
 isamen vibhinn varna kii tikshn rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 The electric arc and some wires also provide linear spectrum
 spectrum kii ek teesri shrenee bhi hoti he
 If electrically immersed in a gas at low pressure, those gases give excited spectrum
 is spectrum main ek duusare se pruthak bahut se patt paae jate hai jinka ek sira tikshn or doosraa kramash: dhoomil hota he
 All these spectrums are called emitted spectrums
 yadi kisi padaarth ke bheetar se sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan bheji jaaen to vah un rashmiyon ko, jinhen swayan utsarjit kar saktaa he, avashoshit kar letaa he
 All the characters of the scene from the electric bulb emanate
 yadi kisi nalee main sodium kii bhaap bhari ho or uske bheetar se balb kaa prakaash bhejkar bahirgat prakaash kaa spectrum liya jaae to uske pile bhaag main do kaali rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 The reason for this is that sodium itself gives a linear spectrum when excited
 is spectrum main do pilo rekhaayen bhi hoti hai jinhen sodium kii "di" rekhaayen kaha jaataa he
 When the light of the bulb passes through the steam of sodium, the sodium absorbs the character corresponding to the d lines and two black lines are formed at this place in the light
 is spectrum kaa avasorana spectrum kehete hai
 There are also three types of absorption spectrums
 jis avasorana spectrum main kaali rekhaayen pai jaati hai unhen rekhiy avasorana spectrum, jinamein kaale band paae jate hai unhen band avasorana spectrum or jinamein spectrum kaa thodaa sa adhik satat kshetra hi avashoshit ho jaataa he unhen satat avasorana spectrum kehete hai
 The instruments used to obtain spectrum are called spectroscopes, spectrometers and spectrographs
 prayek spectrolekhi spectrodarshi main teen mukhya avyav hote hai
 The first part controls the quantities coming from the source in the proper direction, the second part separates the different characters i
e
 the mixed particles and the third part focuses them on a different nucleus
 yadi upkaran main keval spectrum dekhne maatr kii hi vyavastha ho to use spectrodarshi kehete hai, yadi uske tisare bhaag ko ghumaakar spectrum ke vibhinn varnon kaa vichlan padhane kii vyavastha bhi ho to use spectromapi kehete hai isse spectrum kaa sthaayee chitra liya ja saktaa he
 All spectrographics are nearly identical in texture, but two means of reflection are used - prism and grating
 isiilie spectrolekhi bhi do prakaar ke hote hai - prism spectrolekhi or grating spectrolekhi
 The spectrum has been divided into different regions to facilitate study
 yah vibhaajan teen baton ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he - rashmistrot, parikshepan vidhi or abhilekhan 
 The following areas are studied in the Department of Spectroscopy - the far infrared field of view, the ultraviolet field and the vacuum ultraviolet field
 vibhinn bhaagon main vibhinn prakaar ke spectrolekhi kaam aate hai
 The table gives a brief description of the range of various fields, dispersion instruments and recording devices
 spectrum teen prakaar ke hote hai, - rekhiy, pattdaar tathaa satat
 Kel lines are found in the linear spectrum
 pattdaar spectrum main patt band paae jate hai jinka ek kinaaraa tikshn or doosraa kramash: dhoomil hota he
 In continuous spectrum all the characters of the characters are attached to each other
 vibhinn prakaar ke spectrum paane ke liye upyukt rashmistrot kaam main laae jate hai
 The linear spectrum is obtained by excited atoms
 inhen uttejit karne ke liye ooshmaa, vidyut yaa atyadhik urjayukta vidyucchumbakeey rashmiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Usually electric arcs and electric sparks are used
 jwaala, taap bhatthi tathaa vidyut visarjan dwaara bhi parmaanuon ko uttejit kiya jaataa he
 Electric arc - Two metal electrodes are tightened in a particular type of column but remain isolated from the column
 ek scruhed ko ghumaakar electrodon ke bich kaa rikt sthaan kam yaa adhik kiya ja saktaa he
 Both electrodes are combined into a variable resistor and an inductive series
 arq chalaane ke liye aarambh main donon electrode sata die jate hai at: vidyut paripath puraa ho jaataa he or dhara pravaahit hone lagati he
 At the point where the electrodes are connected, a large amount of heat is generated, because there is a very low barrier, and thousands of amperes of current flow
 is ushma ke kaaran electrode ke agr bhaag vashpit ho jate hai or unhen thodaa vilag karne par bhi yah bhaap vidyut paripath ko puraa kiye rahati he
 The molecule-atoms located in this part get excited and give light
 arq kaa tapakram lagbhag 3500 sein
 se 8000 sein
 tak hota he
 The difference between the electrodes before running the main wire arc is equal to the difference of the mains but it decreases while moving the arc
 prayavartidhara se bhi arq chalaae jate hai
 Many types of improvised arcs are available nowadays
 electric sphuling - kii rachana lagbhag arq kii hi bhanti hoti he kintu sphuling ke electrodon kaa vibhavantar arq kii apeksha kai sau guna adhik hota he
 This is the reason why the column of sphurling is kept more secure and well detached from the electrodes
 electrodon ko ek stassop transafarmar ke secondary siron se jod diya jaataa he
 Diffusion of spilling spaces 10,000 v Up to 50,000 volts; Thus, atoms in this source are highly excited
 sphuling rikt sthaan icchaanusaar ghataya badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Molecule atoms excited in this source receive a lot of energy
 at: ve ynit ho jate hai
 Many electrons revolve around the nucleus of an atom or molecule
 ye electron nishchit niyam ke anusaar vibhinn kakshaon main bante rahete hai
 The electrons in the outermost orbit are called "optical electrons"
 yadi kisi anu yaa parmaanu main se ek yaa adhik optical electron nikaal die jaaen to vah "ynit" kaha jaataa he
 When only one electron is released, the atom is in the first ionized state
 yadi duusare, tisare aadi electron bhi nikal jaaen to parmaanu kramash: duusari, teesri aadi ynit sthiti main chalaa jaataa he
 These conditions require progressively more energy
 atyant ucch vibhavantar par chalanevaale sphuling se tin kii 23veen ynit sthiti praapt kii ja chuki he
 Electrophoresis is mainly useful for spectro chemical analysis
 sphuling ko sthir rup se der tak chalaane ke liye isamen vividh prakaar ke sudhaar kiye gaye hai
 The banded spectrum is obtained by igniting the material or burning in a flame of Bunsen volcano
 kuch padaarthon ko vidyut arq main prajvalit karne se bhi pattdaar spectrum praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 The banded spectrum is obtained from a large facility by the electrical immersion in gases
 vidyut visarjan ke liye gas ko bahut kam daab par ek nalee main bharkar uske siron ke bich kai hajaar volt kaa vibhavantar dena padataa he
 Blood vessels are produced by the electric immersion in neon gas
 aajkal pradarshan or prachaar ke liye aksharon or chitron ke aakaar kii visarjan naliyaan banaai jaati hai jinamein nion gas bhari rahati he
 These are called neon signs
 kisi thos padaarth ko itani ooshmaa di jaae ki vah laal hokar chamakane lage to usase satat rashmipunj nikalataa he
 Special types of hydrogen lamps, xenon arc lamps and mercury-vapor immersion are used to obtain continuous spectrum in the field of view from electric bulbs
 vibhinn prakaar ke rashmisroton se jo rashmiyaan nikalati hai unka sthaayee spectrum praapt karne ke liye spectrolekhi kaam main laae jate hai
 The reflecting plant brought into each spectrograph separates mixed colors of different colors
 rashmiyon kaa parikshepan teen ritiyon se hota he: When the rings pass through a prism, they are separated due to refraction
 ise apvartaneey parikshepan kehete hai; If several narrow wrinkles are placed near parallel to each other and a mixed light beam is sent from them, due to diffraction, the rocks are separated and the spectrum is formed
 aise parikshepan ko vivartaneey parikshepan kehete hai; Detachment is also produced by interfering with the stones
 pehali do reetiyaan adhik prachlit hai
 It has three main parts - collimator, prism and camera
 collemetter ek khokhli nalee hoti he jiske ek sire par patali zairi or duusare sire par lens laga hota he
 The distance of the bush and lens are variable and the width of the bush is also variable and the width of the bush is also variable
 prism ek drudh aadhaar par is prakaar rakhaa jaataa he
 That the parallel Rashmipunj coming from the lens should fall on it
 prism se parikshepit rashmiyaan camere main jaati hai or camera lens dwaara photoplate par kendrit kii jaati hai
 The entire system is covered together in such a way that the light cannot go anywhere other than Jhiri
 saamanyat: drishy or parabangnee kshetra main kaam aanevaale spectrograph aise hi hote hai
 Spectroscopy used in the field of view includes glass lenses and prisms
 parabangnee kshetra ke liye quartz, fluoride tathaa fluoride ke prism or lens kaam aate hai
 Useful prisms for remote infrared are not found
 vikshepan badhaane ke liye do yaa teen prism vaale spectrolekhi banaae gaye hai
 Such spectrographs are used for vacuum ultraviolet fields from which air is removed
 inhen nirvaat spectrograph kehete hai

 avarakt ke liye vishesh prakaar ke spectromapi kaam main laae jate hai
 An infrared spectrometer gives the adsorption spectrum of a substance
 satatvarni infrared rashmiyon ko padaarth se hokar jane diya jaataa he
 These are deflected by a prism or grating after the material is released
 vikshepit rashmiyon kaa abhilekh tapavidyut ricarderon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The prisms of chloride and fluoride are placed in these spectrometers and metallic mirror mirrors are replaced by lenses
 kai sankri jhiriyon ko samanaantar rakhkar jo zairismooh banaaya jaataa he use grating kehete hai
 If parallel lines are scratched on a clean transparent glass, then the transparent space between each of the two lines is allowed to fall
 aise shishe ko samtal pargami grating kehete hai
 Their use is limited like prisms
 yadi kisi vakratal par aluminium yaa chaandi kii kalai kii jaae or isi par samaantar rekhaayen khurch di jaaen to yah upkaran avatal paravartak grating kaha jaataa he
 The plane between each of the two lines reflected the spheres, the spectrum obtained from the diffraction of these reflected spheres

 Rolling machine was also made by Roland to scrape the lines, which is still prevalent in the improved form
 vakr grating spectrolekhi main lens kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Rashmipunj falls on a grating through a narrow bush
 paravartit rashmiyaan swat: ek vrutt par kendrit ho jaati hai
 This circle is called "roland circle"
 jis vakratal par rekhaayen khurchi jaati hai use "grating blike" kehete hai
 The radius of the Roland circle is half the curvature of "black"
 yah vrutt grating ko us sthaan par sparsh karata he jahaan iskaa vyas-grating par abhilamb hota he
 At the other end of this feature, a direct image of the jhiri is formed
 ise shunya koti kaa spectrum kehete hai
 The first spectrum found on the Roland circle on both sides is called the first-order spectrum

 Similarly, the ability to show two extremely proximal wavelength lines exactly apart from each other is called differentiation
 yadi kisi spectrum main do aisi rekhaayen lee jaaen jinamein ek kaa tarangadairghy λ { \ displaystyle { \ lambda }} or duusari kaa λ { \ displaystyle { \ lambda }} + δ λ { \ displaystyle { \ Delta \ lambda }} ho to adhik vibhedankshamtawale spectrolekhi main donon rekhaayen ek duusari se alag dikhaai detii hai kintu kam vibhedak spectrolekhi main donon milakar keval ek hi rekha dikhaai padati he
 Differentiation is expressed by the following ratio
 r = λ δ λ { \ displaystyle R={ \ lambda \ over \ Delta \ lambda }} Photographs of dispersed particles are captured in the spectrograph
 ise spectrolekhi kehete hai
 The photographs are recorded where photos cannot be taken
 photo utaarne tathaa abhilekhan ke liye jo upkaran kaam aate hai unhen "dictator" kaha jaataa he
 Different types of dictators are used in various fields of spectrometry

 The reciprocal distances of the lines are measured with the help of a tool called a campator
 prayek parmaanu main ek nabhik hota he
 Many electrons revolve around it in fixed orbits
 electronon kii kul sankhya nabhik ke potanon kii sankhya ke baraabar hoti he
 The number of electrons in different orbitals is also fixed
 koi bhi electron kisi niyat kaksha main hi rah saktaa he
 In fact, these orbits represent the energy position of the atom
 yadi koi electron kisi anya rikt kaksha main chalaa jaae to parmaanu kii urjasthiti badal jaati hai
 It is often not possible to remove the electrons from the inner orbits, but the electrons from the final orbit can move to the next orbit when excited by external heat or electric power
 yadi pehali kaksha main usase sambhddha urja k1 or usase thik agali kaksha main k2 he to pehali se duusari ucchtar urjasthiti main jane ke liye electron keval k2 - k1 urja hi le saktaa he
 Only after going to the excited level does he return to the former position and emit the energy K2 - K1
 is utsarjit yaa avashoshit urja kaa maan hn hi hota he arthath electron ek urjaster se thik agle urjaster main jane yaa waapas aane main nishchit urja nd arg hi le saktaa he yaa de saktaa he
 This cannot cause less energy to be exchanged

 isi prakaar jab electron anya urjastaron main sankraman karata he to bhinn-bhinn aavriti kii rashmiyaan praapt hoti hai or spectrum main tadnukool bahut si rekhaayen ban jaati hai
 According to the arrangement of electrons in molecules, atoms are found to have many electronic energy levels and different types of spectrum are obtained due to electronic transition
 parmaanuon main keval electranik urjasthitiyaan hi pai jaati hai
 Therefore, the transition of electrons emits particles of fixed wavelength and gives linear spectrum
 anuon main teen prakaar kii urja hoti he - electranik, kampanjnya or ghurnanjanya 
 The electronic energy value is even lower
 jis prakaar electranik urjasthitiyaan niyat hai usee prakaar kampanjnya or ghurnanjanya urja kii sthitiyaan bhi niyat hai
 Hence a band or band is obtained by vibrational transition
 prayek bed main ghurnanjanya sankraman se rekhaayen praapt hoti hai
 They are very close, so small spectroscopes are not seen separately and only bands of different characters are visible in the spectrum
 adhik parikshepan tathaa vibhedankshamtawale spectrodarshi se in rekhaon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Molecules of more than two atomic molecules have even closer lines, so they are harder to see

 The Mongols invaded China during this period

 For a short period, he also worked in the court of Kublai Khan
 par uski yah seva vritti utani mahatvapurn nahin he jitani uski yatra sambandhi diary
 In this diary, he discussed the relationship of China, which resulted in the attention of western countries towards China
 isi samay italy shaharon se anek yatri nikat purv kii yatra karne ke silsile main china bhi aaye
 In addition, Roman Catholics also tried to establish a relationship with China
 lekin terahavin sadi ke uttararddh se lekar chaudaavin sadi ke uttararddh tak china se sampark kaayam ke liye in deshon ne jo kuch bhi prayaas kiya vah kisi bhi drushtikon se vishesh mahatva kaa nahin he
 At this time the number of passengers entering China was also small
 par itnaa sahi he ki isi samay se european deshon kaa dhyaan asia ke sampann deshon kii ore gaya or ve agaami sadiyon main in par chaa jane kaa prayaas karne lage
 When Ming-rule started in China, these travelers started traveling to China again
 is samay bhi pehle kii tarah yatra sambandhi anek asuvidhaayen thim
 Due to them, foreigners could not maintain close contact with China even in this period
 in asuvidhaon main sabase badi avaagaman sambandhi asuvidha thi
 Trade relations between China and European countries still existed, but many trade difficulties still arose due to these inconveniences of traffic
 europe or asia ke saare vyapaaree apane vyapaarik jahaajon ke saath pehle lalsaagar main utarkar use paar karte the or iske baad mistra kaa paribhraman karte hue ve aakar bumadhyasaagar main utarate the
 There was another way to do business

 In connection with the journey, they used to leave the Gulf of Iran and travel to countries like Basra, Baghdad, Mecca and reach Asia Minor
 is tarah is avaagaman kii asuvidha, ke chalate jahaan ek ore in vyapaariyon kaa aarthik sambandh katipay deshon se kaayam nahin ho saktaa tha, vahaan duusari ore unhen kaaphi samay vyarth hi ganvaane padate the
 In fact, this was the reason why these days Western countries could not establish relations with Eastern countries
 itnaa hi nahin, aage chalakar pandrahavin sadi ke uttararddh main unke bache-khuche vyapaaree maarg bhi avaruddh ho gayi
 The reason for this was that in 1453 AD a great conqueror of the Ottoman race, Muhammed II took over Kustuntunia and closed his trading route
 phir bhi in asuvidhaon se bhi pashchimi deshon ke yatriyon tathaa vyapaariyon ne sangharsh kiya or kuch had tak china se sambandh kaayam kiya
 Foreigners must have had some contact with China as long as the Mongol ruler Yuan survived
 lekin jaise hi isaki mrityu hui vaise hi aisa prathit hone laga ki ab unke parsparik sambandh samaapt ho jaayenge
 But the Ming emperors revived this relationship and were oriented towards Western countries
 samay bitate rahane par pashchimi deshon ke vyapaaree purvi deshon kii aarthik sampannataa vismaran nahin kar paae the
 Marcopolo's diary had become a source of inspiration for him, so between the end of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth century, the journey of these travelers began to be revived and expanded
 is samay spanish, dach or rusi jatiyon ne asia ke purvi tathaa uttari kshetron kii ore sambandh aage badhaane main sahyog diya

 The Chinese considered these Portuguese to be rude and hurtful

 This Macao is located near the famous port city of China, where a large number of Portuguese still live today

 In 1498, Vasco da Gama laid his feet on Indo-land while traveling to the seaside regions of Africa
 Portuguese traveler Vasco da Gama benefited from the journey that the people of the Western countries, primarily in immediate transit to the Portuguese, to the eastern countries Route detected
 isliye unka prasthaan tathaa vistaar ab anya deshon main bhi hone laga
 He reached China at the time of taking over Malacca in the early 16th century

 As soon as he came to China, he became involved in business

 But the Portuguese could not please the Chinese by their behavior
 inke vyavhaar tathaa aadaten acchhee nahin thi keval portguese hi bure nahin the, anya jatiyon kii bhi aisi hi aadaten thim
 When the people of Spain reached America, the life of the original castes there also became very annoying due to them
 spain ke logon ke virodh kiye jane par bhi america nahin choda or vahaan bastiyon kaa nirmaan kar niyamit rup se bas gayi
 As soon as they settled regularly, they began to interfere in the religion, culture, living, etc
 of the American people
 itnaa hi nahin, bastiyon ke nirmaan ke saath-saath shanahshanaih ve upnivesh nirmaan kii ore bhi unmukh hue isi silsile main spainvasi china bhi pahunche
 The Spanish came to China after the Portuguese
 america main is jati ne jis prakaar kii harakat kii thi, usase china ke log parichit hi the
 Therefore, as soon as the arrival of this caste took the seeds of colonization on Chinese soil, the Chinese started opposing them
 ming sarkaar ne to is jati ke viruddh ek joardaar aandolan bhi prarambh kar diya
 This is the reason why the Spaniards could not melt in China like America
 ve china main na to apana astitv hi kaayam kar sake or na aakankshit bastiyon kaa hi nirmaan kar sake
 Commercial relations with the Portuguese were also established
 inase yah sambandh bhi kaayam nahin ho sakaa
 Nevertheless, the Spanish were stubborn
 america main jis prakaar ve balpurvak rahane lage the usee prakaar ve china main bhi rahane kaa prayaas kiye
 a group of them stayed in the famous port canton of China and tried to establish a commercial relationship with China
 ant main, atharahavin sadi ke uttararddh main apane kaary main unhen safalataa mili or makaao main apni basti kaa nirmaan kar ve rahane lage
 At the same time, many religious missionaries from the west also came to China
 china main in mishnariyon ne dharm kaa prachaar karnaa prarambh kiya
 Initially the behavior of these missionaries was good, but later the Chinese people became aware of their selfish policy
 isi samay angrejon tathaa dachon kaa bhi aagaman china main hua
 But it should be remembered here that under the rule of the Ming dynasty, China had two kinds of relations with the Western countries - a trade relationship and a religious relationship
 pashchim ke desh dakshin ke bhukhndon kaa makaao tathaa canton se vyapaar karte the
 Traders from the west brought many grain-related plants and tobacco to their countries in China
 tambaaku kaa prachaar in logon ne kaaphi kiya
 Because of this, most of the people of China started consuming tobacco
 isi prakaar china se unka dharmik sambandh bhi kaayam tha
 Missionaries from western countries used to preach in the interior of China
 mongolon ke shashan ke baad china main isaayiyon kaa ant ho chalaa tha or unka prabhaav ghatane laga tha
 But in the last years of Ming Dynasty, Roman Catholics revived these Christians and their missionaries
 isi samay britain, france vagairah se franciscan, agstinian, juseit, dominian aadi anek dharmik sampradaay ke log china pahunch gayi
 It was only in the early years of the sixteenth century that the predominance of the Jesuit cult began to prevail in China

 Not only this preacher propagated this community in China
 vastutah jevirs ke chalate hi china main yah sampradaay jivit ho sakaa
 At present, Javisarya had not even got complete success in his work that in 1556 AD he passed away from the world

 He had to study his religion, he studied Confucius's religion and Christianity deeply and tried to keep the equality and inequality of both religions as a scholar

 At the same time, the Spaniard also came to China from the Philippine
 abtak china main anek pashchimi jatiyaan aa gayi thim
 The Portuguese arrived in 1516 AD, the Spanish arrived in 1575 AD; The Dutch arrived in 1604 AD and the British arrived in 1637 AD

 His arrival also occurred in China during the Ching reign
 1644 i

 In the north, the conquerors named Manchu defeated Ming

 In the latter half of the Sohalteenth and early Seventeenth centuries, they strengthened themselves and hijacked Mukden from Ming, which was also their capital
 mukden ko ve bhi apni rajdhani banaae
 The Mongols living in China also willingly or unwillingly accepted the rule of the Manchus
 manchuon ne china kii dakshini diwaar tak apni rajya-seemaa badhaane kaa prayaas kiya
 At the same time, when a feeling of dissatisfaction against the Ming was born in China, Manchuo took the opportunity to take control of Peking, and since then he started ruling in China
 konghsi or china lung is vansh ke sarvaadhik pratapi raja hue
 For a long time Manchuo ruled China
 manchookaal main bhi pashchimi logon kaa aagaman china main hua
 If truth be told, it is to be believed that it was during this period that the influence of Western countries in China started to build up and it was during this period that China's real relationship with foreign countries was established

 Only Russians came by land route who started trading in silver in China

 By this treaty Russia got the right to send a mission to Peking
 peking main rus kii mishanri bhi kaary karne lagi
 This relationship with America and Russia proved to be important for China
 china main is samay punah videshi mishnariyon kaa bhi aagaman hua
 Foreign missionaries also arrived at this time in eighteenth-century China
 atharahavin sadi ke prarambh tak china main isaayiyon kii sankhya 3,00,000 ho gayi thi
 In 1793, a British mission first came to China
 yah mishan mecortne ke netritv main china aayaa tha
 The second mission came to Peking in 1816 AD
 iskaa netritvkarta lard amherst tha
 At the same time, a mission under Robert Morishan also reached China
 is maukey se laabh uthaakar ab protestand mishnariyon ne china main apana kaary prarambh kiya
 Protestants looked down upon the Chinese and considered them rude
 angrejon kii dekha-dekhi dach mishnariyaan bhi china aayin or 1795 i
 main unka pehla mishan china pahunchaa
 Similarly, a messenger from Russia arrived in 1806 AD
 lekin china ne uske prati kisi bhi prakaar kii sahanubhuti kaa pradarshan nahin kiya
 Peking also reached the Gemuite of France and sang the glory of the Manchu emperor
 vibhinn mishnariyon main sarvaadhik chatur tathaa prabhaavshaalini angrejon kii mishnariyaan sabit huin
 If we compare the English missionaries with the various missionaries who came to China, then it becomes clear that in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the English missionary surpassed all
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki angrej atyant chatur tathaa karmath the
 Due to his business acumen and political prowess, he did not allow other missionaries to advance in the competition and in future he was able to establish his influence in China
 uparyukt vivaran se spasht ho jaataa he ki china tathaa paashchaatya deshon ke bich sambandh kaayam ho chalaa tha or unnisvin sadi tak sampoorn china anek videshi tathaa unki mishnariyaan drushtigochar hone lagi thim
 But that relationship could not proceed peacefully
 china kii janata sarkaar in videshiyon tathaa unki mishnariyon se dhire-dhire ghrinaa karne lagi
 His idea was that China's civilization and culture could be destroyed by increasing contact with Western countries, so China experienced western trends and tried to stay away from them
 paashchaatya deshon ke sampark main aakar bhi usne apni vesh-bhusha, dharm or reeti-rivaajon ko angikaar kiya
 This was the reason that the Manchu government began to try to remain separate from these western countries openly, keeping in mind that Emperor Kanghasi took out a state communiqué and tried to deprive these castes and missionaries from entering China
 is vijyapti ke peeche samrat kii apni bhaavana to thi hi, saath-hi-saath china kii janata ko bhi santusht karne ke liye use yah vijyapti nikaalani padi
 People of China started hating these foreigners and it was expected that there could be bloodshed in China
 visheshkar videshi mishnariyon se china main kaaphi asantosh tha
 "the feuds between the various missionary orders, the recognition of the emperor's order by some religion-minded people respecting the ancestors, as well as the lack of authority by their officers' representation towards the trend of the new religion, gradually led to misleading ideas
 Opened her eyes to the real character of the preacher
 lekin yah yaad rakhni chahie ki is vijyapti ke anusaar china main aae hue videshiyon ko china se baahar nahin nikaala gaya
 It was said that only a kind of control was placed on them or traders coming from different countries
 china kii manchu sarkaar ko yah ashanka ho gayi thi ki agar in vyapaariyon ko vyapaar karne kii anumati nahin di jaaegi to ve sampoorn china main falkar ashaanti failaane kaa praytn karenge
 Therefore, it was made clear in this release that these foreign traders can trade peacefully from all the coastal ports of China
 vyapaar karne kii anumati milte hi videshiyon kii prasannataa kaa parawar nahin rahaa kyonki bade sahaj dhang se hi unhen yah anumati mil gayi thi
 This encouraged both their enthusiasm and encouragement
 faltah arth-lolupata ke chalate in logon ne nazaij vyapaar bhi karnaa prarambh kiya
 They also began to misuse the trading facilities they had received
 swaabhaavik rup se china kii sarkaar kaa dhyaan punah unki ore aakarshith hua
 That is why the second emperor of Manchu dynasty, Chien Luge, issued a second communique in 1757 AD, due to which foreign trade was limited in China and many kinds of restrictions were imposed on the traders
 is vijyapti ke anusaar in videshi vyapaariyon ko dakshini china ke keval ek bandargah canton se vyapaar karne kii anumati mili
 In addition, a trading party was organized in China called 'co-hung'
 is dal ke paraamarsh tathaa dekh-rekh main hi videshi vyapaaree china se vyapaar kar sakate the
 Thus in the second half of the eighteenth century, the Chinese government kept a sharp eye on the moves of those merchants and made it clear that they could not visit any other port for business matters
 par is vijyapti kaa koi vishesh asar videshi vyapaariyon par nahin padaa
 Along with trade, they began to interfere in the politics of China, and the Christian missionaries began to get worse
 canton se vyapaar karte-karte ve china ke anya bandargahon se bhi vyapaar karne lage
 The Chinese started making their habits bad by consuming opium
 opium khaane kii aadat pad jane se vyapaaree opium kii bikri dwaara aarthik laabh praapt karnaa chaahate the
 When the Chinese government began to see the bad consequences of opium and stopped this trade, then foreign traders started bribing the Chinese officers to join them and this trade continued in secret
 is kaary main england ke angrej atyant patu the
 Due to opium, China began to suffer two types of losses
 ek to opium kii bikri bad jane se angrejon ko phayda hua, lekin china ko aarthik kshati uthaani padi
 Second is that the moral level of the people of China started falling down
 faltah sarkaar ne purna kathorta ke saath opium ke vyapaar par niyantran rakhane kaa prayaas kiya jiske falswaroop china tathaa britain main opium yuddh hua
 China could not succeed in this war because its enemies had a powerful and central government and China's rule was weak and decentralized
 atah in shatruon kaa saamana karne ke liye china shashan kamjor tathaa vikendrit tha
 Therefore China was not ready to face these enemies at all
 ’’ In this way, after many years until the nineteenth century, the relationship of foreigners with China was established
