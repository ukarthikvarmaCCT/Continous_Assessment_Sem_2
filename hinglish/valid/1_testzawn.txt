 Action potential occurs in many types of animal cells, called excitatory cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells
 neurons main, koshika se koshika sanchaar main ve ek kendriya bhoomika nibhaate hai
 In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intercellular processes
 mansapeshi koshikaon main, udhaaharan ke liye, ek acshan potenshial, sankuchan main falit hone vaali ghatnaon kii shrinkhalaa main pehla kadam he
 In the beta cells of the pancreas, they induce insulin secretion
 neurons main acshan potenshial ko "tantrika aaveg" yaa "spikes" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he or neuron dwaara utpann acshan potenshial kaa asthaayee anukram uskaa "spike train" kehalaata he
 a neuron that emits an action potential is often referred to as "firing"
 kriya vibhav ko koshika kii plasma jhilli main sannihit vishesh prakaar ke voltage-gated aayan channel dwaara utpann kiya jaataa he
 These channels are closed when the membrane potential is close to the resting potential of the cell, but they begin to open rapidly when the membrane potential increases to a precisely defined initial value
 jab channel khulte hai, to ve sodium yanon ke aavak kii anumati dete hai, jo jhilli kshamta main ek aavak ke pravaah kii vruddhi, jo parivartan vidyut-rasinic pravanta ko parivartit karata he, jo badale main jhilli kshamta main or vruddhi karte hai
 This action results in more channels opening, producing more electric current and so on
 yah prakriya visphotak rup se tab tak aage badhati rahati he jab tak ki sabhi uplabdh aayan channel khul nahin jate, jiske falswaroop jhilli kshamta main ek vishaal oochaal aata he
 The rapid inflow of sodium ions reverses the polarity of the plasma membrane, and the ion channels are rapidly inactivated thereafter
 sodium channelon ke band hone par, sodium aayan ab neuron main pravesh nahin kar sakate or ve sakriy rup se plasma jhilli pahunchaaya jaataa he
 The potassium channels are then activated and there is an outward current of potassium ions, which brings the electrochemical gradient back to the resting state
 ek acshan potenshial ke ho jane ke baad, vahaan ek kshanik nakaaratmak badlaav hota he, jise atirikt potacium dhaaraon ke kaaran afterhyperpolaraijeshan yaa du:saadhy avadhi kaha jaataa he
 This is the mechanism that prevents an action potential from traveling back the way it came
 pashu koshikaon main, acshan potenshial ke do mukhya prakaar hai, pehla prakaar voltage-gated sodium channelon dwaara utpann hota he or doosraa prakaar voltage-gated calcium channelon dwaara
 sodium-aadhaarit acshan potenshial aam taur par ek milisecond se kam samay tak chalate hai, jabaki calcium-aadhaarit acshan potenshial 100 milisecond yaa zyada samay tak chal sakate hai
 In some types of neurons, slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly emitting sodium spikes
 duusari taraf, hriday kii mansapeshi koshikaon main, ek aarambhik teevr sodium spike, ek calcium spike kii teevr shuruyaat ko uksaane ke liye ek "primer" pradaan karata he, jo tab mansapeshi sankuchan ko utpann karata he
 All cells in animal body tissue are electrically polar - in other words, they maintain a voltage variation around the cell's plasma membrane, known as the membrane potential
 yah vidyutiya dhruvikaran, aayan pump naamak jhilli main sannihit protein sanrachanaon or aayan channel ke bich jatil paraspar kriya se falit hota he
 In neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane are usually different in different parts of the cell, imparting different electrical properties to the dendrite, axon, and cell body
 ek parinaam ke rup main, neuron ke jhilli ke kuch bhaag uttejneey ho sakate hai, jabaki anya nahin hote hai
 The most excitable part of the neuron is usually the axon hill, but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases
 jhilli ke prayek uttejneey ptch main jhilli kshamta kaa do mahatvapurn str hota he: vishram kshamta, jo vah maan he jise jhilli kshamta tab tak banaae rakhti he jab tak koshika ko koi chiz pareshaan nahin karti or ek ucch maan jo aarambhik kshamta kehalaata he
 On the axon hill of a specific neuron, the resting potential is around −70 mv and the initial potential is around −55 mv
 ek neuron main syneptic input ke kaaran jhilli vidhruviya yaa ati-dhruviya ho jaati he; arthath ve jhilli kshamta ko badhane yaa ghatane ke liye prerit karte hai
 The action potential is triggered when sufficient depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential to the limit
 jab ek acshan potenshial chaalu hota he, tab jhilli kshamta achaanak upar kii ore uthati he, jo aksar +100 mv tak pahunchati he or phir samaan rup se achaanak waapas neeche girti he, jo aksar vishram str se neeche samaapt hoti he, jahaan yah kuch samay ke liye rahati he
 The size of the action potential is conservative; That is, the amplitude and the period of rise and fall for all action potentials in a given cell are usually approximately the same
 adhikansh neurons main, puri prakriya ek second ke hajaarwein bhaag main ghatati he
 Many forms of neurons emit action potentials continuously at rates of up to 10–100 per second; Some types, however, are quiet and can last for one minute or more without emission of any action potential
 jaev-bhautik str par, acshan potenshial, vishesh prakaar ke voltage-gated aayan channel se parinamit hote hai
 As the membrane potential increases, the sodium ion channel opens, allowing sodium ions to enter the cell
 iske baad potacium aayan channel khulte hai jo koshika se potacium yanon ko baahar nikalne kii anumati dete hai
 The inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and induces depolarization, where the capacity of the cell exceeds the resting potential of the cell
 sodium channel, acshan potenshial ke charam par band ho jate hai, jabaki potacium kaa koshika ko chhodana jari rahata he
 The depletion of potassium ions reduces the membrane potential or makes the cell hyperpolarized
 vishram se alp voltage vruddhi ke liye, potacium dhara, sodium dhara se adhik ho jaati he or voltage apane saamaanya vishram maan par laut aata he, aamtaur par -70 mv
 haalanki, agar voltage ek mahatvapurn seemaa se aage bad jaataa he, aam taur par vishram maan se 15 mv adhik, to sodium dhara haaavee ho jaati he
 This results in a spontaneous state where a positive reaction from the sodium current activates more sodium channels
 is prakaar, vah koshika ek acshan potenshial ko utpann karte hue "fire" karti he
 The currents produced by the opening of a voltage-gated channel in the order of an action potential are generally significantly larger than the initial excitatory currents
 is prakaar aayam, avadhi or acshan potenshial kaa aakaar kaaphi had tak uttejneey jhilli ke gun dwaara nirdhaarit hote hai or na ki uttejnaa ke aayam yaa avadhi dwaara
 acshan potenshial kaa yah ol-or-nathing gun use set ise kramik kshamta se alag karata he jaise receptor kshamta, electrotonic kshamta or syneptic kshamta, jo uttejnaa kii tivrata ke saath badhati he
 Different cell types and multiple types of action potentials exist in cell cells, which are determined by the types of voltage-gated channels, leak channels, channel distributions, ion concentrations, membrane capacitors, temperature, and other factors
 acshan potenshial main shaamil mukhya aayan hai sodium or potacium dhanayan; sodium aayan koshika main pravesh karte hai or potacium aayan baahar nikal jate hai or santulan bana rahata he
 For rapid changes in membrane voltage, relatively few ions need to cross the membrane
 ek acshan potenshial ke dauraan vinimay hue aayan, isliye, aantarik or bahya aayan sankendran main ek naganya badlaav karte hai
 Some ions, which actually cross, are thrown out by the continuous action of the sodium-potassium pump, which maintains a normal ratio of ion concentration across the membrane with other ion transporters
 calcium dhanayan or chloride runayan, acshan potenshial ke kuch prakaaron main shaamil hai, udhaaharan ke liye kramshah hriday sambandhi acshan potenshial or ekal koshika alga, essetabularia main acshan potenshial
 Although action potentials are generated on patches of locally excitable membranes, resulting currents can initiate action potentials on the membrane surrounding the spread, producing variances similar to dominoes
 vidyut kshamta ke niskriy prasar ke vipareet, acshan potenshial, jhilli ke uttejneey failaav ke paas nae sire se utpann hote hai or bina kshay ke failte hai
 Myelin coated segments of the axon are not excitable and do not generate action potentials and the signal is passively transmitted as an electrotonic potential
 niyamit antaraal par bina melin lepit ptch, jise nodes of ranviar kaha jaataa he, sanket ko badhaane ke liye acshan potenshial utpann karte hai
 Known as unstable conductance, this type of signal provides a favorable compromising symmetry of propagation, signal velocity, and axon diameter

 In addition, post-diffusion action potentials have been recorded in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons, which are ubiquitous in the neocortex
 mana jaataa he ki spike-timming-dependent plasticity main inaki ek bhoomika hoti he
 Electrical signals within biological organisms are, in general, driven by ions
 acshan potenshial ke liye sabase mahatvapurn dhanayan, sodium or potacium he
 Both are monovalent cations, which carry a single positive charge
 acshan potenshial main calcium bhi shaamil ho saktaa he, jo ek dwisanyojak fatayan he jo doharaa sakaaratmak charge vahan karata he
 Chloride anion plays a large role in the action potential of some algae, but plays a negligible role in the action potential of most animals
 aayan do prabhaav ke tahat koshika jhilli ko paar karte hai: visaran or vidyut kshetra
 ek saral udhaaharan jisamen do vilay -A or B- ko ek chhidradaar baadha se alag karnaa yah vyakhya karata he ki visaran yah sunishchit karegaa ki ve antat samaan vilay main mishrit ho jaayenge
 yah mishran, unke sankendran main antar kii vajah se hota he
 The region with higher concentration will be diverted to the region with lower concentration
 To extend the example, assume that merger a has 30 sodium ions and 30 chloride ions
 iske alaava, maan lete hai ki vilay b main keval 20 sodium aayan or 20 chloride aayan hai
 Assuming that the barrier allows both types of ions to pass through, then a steady state is reached where both mergers have 25 sodium ions and 25 chloride ions
 haalanki, agar chhidradaar baadha is baat par chaynaatmak ho ki kis aayan ko guzarane diya jaae, to akele visaran, falit vilay ko nirdhaarit nahin karegaa
 Returning to the previous example, form a barrier that is permeable only by sodium ions
 chunki vilay b main sodium or chloride, donon kaa nune sankendran he, vah baadha vilay se donon yanon ko aakarshith karegi
 However, only sodium will travel through the barrier
 isse vilay b main sodium kaa ek sanchay falit hoga
 Since sodium has a positive charge, this accumulation will make merger b more positive than merger A
 Positive sodium ions will be less likely to travel to merger B, now more positive
 isse aayan pravaah ko niyantrit karne vaale duusare kaarak kaa nirmaan hota he, arthath vidyut kshetra
 vah bindu jahaan yah vidyut kshetra visaran ke kaaran bal kaa puri tarah se virodh karata he use santulan kshamta kaha jaataa he
 At this point, the net current of this specific ion is zero
 prayek neuron ek koshika jhilli main lipta hota he jo ek phospholipid bilair se bani hoti he
 This membrane is almost impermeable to ion
 yanon ko neuron ke baahar or andar antaran ke liye, jhilli do sanrachanaon ko pradaan karti he
 Ion pumps use the energy of the cell to continuously move ions in and out
 ve yanon ko apane sankendran pravanta ke khilaaf bhejkar, sankendran bhinnata kaa nirmaan karte hai 
 The ion channels then use this concentration difference to send the ions down their concentration gradient
 haalanki, aayan panpon dwaara satat parivahan ke vipareet, aayan channelon dwaara parivahan asatat he
 They open and close only in response to the signals of their surroundings
 aayan channelon ke madhyam se yanon kaa yah parivahan tab koshika jhilli ke voltage ko badalata he
 These are the changes that bring an action potential
 ek saadrishy ke rup main, aayan pump us bydaree kii bhoomika nibhaate hai jo ek radio circuit ko ek sanket sanchaarit karne ke liye anumati dete hai
 The cell membrane acts as a barrier that prevents the inside merge from being mixed with the outside merge
 in do vilyon main unke yanon kaa bhinn sankendran he
 Furthermore, this difference in concentration results in a variation in the charge of the merger
 isse ek aisi paristhiti panapati he jahaan ek vilay duusare vilay se adhik dhanatmak hota he
 Positive ions, therefore, tend to pull in the direction of negative mergers
 isi tarah, rinatmak aayan, dhanatmak vilay kii disha main khinchne lagate hai
 To measure this property, a person would somehow want to hold this relative positivity
 To do this, the out-of-phase merger is set as zero voltage
 tab andruni voltage or shunya voltage ke bich antar nirdhaarit hota he
 For example, if the external voltage is 100 mv and the inside voltage is 30 mv, the difference is -70 mv
 yahi antar he jise saamanytah jhilli kshamta ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 Ion channels are integral membrane proteins that have a hole through which ions can travel between the extracellular space and the inner cell
 zyaadaatar channel ek aayan ke liye vishisht hote hai; udhaaharan ke liye, sodium kii tulana main potacium ke liye adhikansh potacium channel 1000:1 chaynaatmakataa anupaat se charitaarth hote hai, haalanki potacium or sodium yanon main ek hi charge hota he or ve keval apni trigya main thodaa bhinn hote hai
 The channel hole is usually so small that ions must pass through it in a single-file sequence
 aayan maarg ke liye channel chhidr yaa to khule yaa band ho sakate hai, haalanki kai channel, vibhinn up chaalakata str ko pradarshit karte hai
 When a channel is open, the ions penetrate down the transmembrane concentration gradient through the channel hole for that particular ion
 channel ke madhyam se aayan pravaah dar, arthath, ekal-channel vidyut aayam, adhiktam channel chaalakata or us aayan ke liye vidyut-rasinic preran bal dwaara nirdhaarit hota he, jo jhilli kshamta ke taatkaalik maan or vipareet kshamta ke maan ke bich kaa antar he
 Action potential is the manifestation of different ion channels opening and closing at different times
 ek channel kii kai vibhinn avasthaaen ho sakati hai, lekin prayek aisi avasthaa yaa to band he yaa khuli
 saamaanya rup se, band avasthaa yaa to chhidr ke ek sankuchan ke anuroop hogi - ise aayan ke liye agamya banaate hue - yaa chhidr ko rokte hue protein ke ek alag hisse ke anuroop
 udhaaharan ke liye, voltage-nirbhar sodium channel niskriyata se guzarataa he, jisamen protein kaa ek bhaag chhidr main sarak jaataa he or use band kar detaa he
 This inactivation closes the sodium block and plays an important role in the action potential
 aayan channelon ko is baat ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he ki ve apane parivesh ke khilaaf kaise pratikriya dete hai
 For example, the ion channels involved in the action potential are voltage-sensitive channels; They open and close in response to voltage across the membrane
 ligand-gated channel ek anya mahatvapurn varg kaa nirmaan karte hai; ye aayan channel ligand anu ke bandhan ke liye pratikriyaswaroop khulte or band hote hai, jaise neurotransmeter
 anya aayan channel, yantric balon ke saath khulte or band hote hai
 Still other ion channels - such as those with sensory neurons - open and close in response to other stimuli, such as light, temperature, or pressure
 acshan potenshial kii ynic dhara, sampoorn koshika jhilli main aayan ke sankendran bhinnata kii pratikriya main pravaahit hoti he
 These concentration variations are established by ion pumps, which are integral membrane proteins that conduct active transport, that is, use cellular energy to pump the ion against their concentration gradient
 aise aayan pump, yanon ko jhilli ke ek paksh se lete hai or unhen duusare paksh main chhodte hai 
 The most relevant ion pump for action potentials is the sodium-potassium pump, which excretes three sodium ions from the cell into two potassium ions
 parinamswaroop, neuron ke andar potacium yanon K+ kaa sankendran baahar ke sankendran kii tulana main mote taur par 20 guna adhik hota he, jabaki baahar kaa sodium sankendran andar kii apeksha lagbhag nau guna bada hota he
 In the same manner, other ions have different concentrations inside and outside the neuron, such as calcium, chloride, and magnesium
 aayan pump, antarkoshikeey or bahya koshikeey aayan sankendran ke saapeksh anupaat kii sthapana dwaara hi acshan potenshial kshamta prabhavit karte hai
 The action potential mainly involves the opening and closing of ion channels, not ion pumps
 agar aayan panpon ko band karne ke liye unke urja strot ko hataa diya jaae, yaa waben jaise avrodh ko jod diya jaae, to us sthiti main bhi akshatantu apane aayam ke tezi se kshay hone se pehle saikadon hazaar acshan potenshial ko fire kar saktaa he
 In particular, ion pumps do not play an important role in the re-polarization of the membrane after an action potential
 jaisaa ki unki gati ko prerit karne vaale aayan or bal khand main varnit he, ek aayan kii santulan yaa ultaav kshamta transamembrane voltage kaa vah maan he jis par aayan ke visaran gatividhi dwaara utpann vidyut bal, uske sankendran pravanta ke neeche us visaran ke aanvik bal ke baraabar ho jate hai
 The equilibrium potential for any ion can be calculated using the Nernst equation
 udhaaharan ke liye, potacium yanon ke liye paltaav kshamta nimnanusaar hoga where: bhale hi do bhinn yanon main ek hi charge he, unamem phir bhi bilkul bhinn santulan kshamta ho sakati he, basharte ki unka bahya or / yaa pradaan kii sankendran ke baahar unke or / yaa andar alag
 udhaaharan ke liye, neurons main potacium or sodium kii santulan kshamta
 potacium santulan kshamta e k, -84 mv he jahaan 5 mmol / l potacium baahar or 140 mmol / l andar he
 On the other hand, the sodium equilibrium potential e Na is approximately +40 mv where 1-2 mmol / l sodium is inside and 120 mmol / l outside
 haalanki, vahaan ek santulan jhilli kshamta e m hoti he jis par sampoorn jhilli par sabhi yanon kaa shuddh pravaah shunya hota he
 This potential is calculated by the Goldman equation
 sankshep main, yah narnst sameekaran he, is myne main ki yah sawaal vaale aayan ke charge par aadhaarit he, saath hi saath unke baahar or andar ke sankendran ke bich kii bhinnata par bhi
 haalanki, yah prashn main prayek aayan ke liye plasma jhilli kii saapeksh pargamyata par bhi vichaar karata he
 For the three most important monovalent ions of the action potential: potassium, sodium, and chloride
 ek anayan hone ke naate, chloride padon ke saath fatian padon se alag vyavhaar kiya jaataa he; andar kaa sankendran ansh he or baahar kaa sankendran har he, jo fatian shabdon se ulat he
 p i is for the permeability of the type i ion
 agar calcium yanon par bhi vichaar kiya jaae, jo mansapeshiyon main acshan potenshial ke liye mahatvapurn hai, to santulan kshamta ke liye sutara or adhik jatil ho jaataa he
 The origin of the resting membrane potential can be clearly explained by the Goldman equation
 adhikansh pashu koshikaon kii vishram plasma jhilli K+ ke prati adhik pargamya he, jo vishram kshamta v rest ko potacium santulan kshamta ke nazadik karata he
 It is important to know that the ionic and water permeability of pure lipid bipyramids is very low and it is negligible in a similar way to ions of comparable size, such as Na + k +
 haalanki, koshika jhilliyaan, badi sankhya main aayan channel, jal channel or vibhinn ynic panpon, excanger or transportron ko dhaaran karti hai jo naatakeey or chuninda rup se vibhinn yanon ke liye jhilli kii pargamyata ko badhaati hai
 Relatively high membrane permeability for potassium ion at resting potentials results from inward-modifying potassium ion channels that open at negative voltages, free modifier k + channels such as so-called leaky potassium conductances that are closed in the open state
 in potacium channelon ko voltage-sakriy K+ se bhinn samajha janaa chahie jo acshan potenshial ke dauraan jhilli punardhruvikaran ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 Many types of cells support action potentials, such as plant cells, muscle cells, and specialized cells of the heart
 haalanki, mukhya uttejneey koshika neuron he, jisamen acshan potenshial ke liye sabase aasaan tantra bhi he
 Neurons are electrically excitable cells composed of one or more dendrites of the axon more common, a single soma, a single axon, and one or more axon terminals
 dendrite, do prakaar ke sinapces main se ek he, doosraa prakaar akshatantu terminal botans he
 Dendrites constitute protrusions in response to axon terminal bottons
 in utkshepan, yaa shul ko, priseneptic neuron dwaara jari neurotransmeter par kabja karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 They have a high concentration of ligand-activated channels
 isliye yahi vah jagah he jahaan par do neurons se synapces ek duusare ke saath samvaad karte hai
 These spines have a thin neck that connects a bulbous protrusion to the main dendrite
 isse yah sunishchit hota he ki jo parivartan ridh ke andar ho rahe hai unke dwaara aas-paas kii ridh ko prabhavit karne kii kam sambhaavna he
 Hence the spine, similar to dendrites with the rare exception, acts as an independent entity
 iske baad dendrite, soma se judata he
 The soma carries the nucleus, which acts as a regulator for the neuron
 ridh ke vipareet, soma kii sataha voltage dwaara sakriy aayan channelon se vyaapt he
 These channels help transmit the signals generated by dendrites
 soma se akshatantu girika baahar nikalati he
 This region is characterized by holding an incredibly high concentration of sodium channels activated by voltage
 saamaanya rup main, acshan potenshial ke liye ise spike armbh kshetra mana jaataa he
 Multiple signals generated on the spine and transmitted by the soma, all converge here
 akshatantu girika ke turant baad akshatantu he
 It is a thin cylindrical protrusion that travels away from the soma
 yah akshatantu ek melin khol dwaara pruthak hota he
 Myelin is made up of Schwann cells that wrap themselves around the axon segment several times
 isse ek moti vasa kii parat banati he jo yanon ko akshatantu main pravesh karne yaa bhaagane se roktaa he
 This isolation performs both functions, preventing critical signal decay as well as ensuring rapid signal speed
 haalanki, is algaav main yah pratibandh he ki akshatantu kii sataha par koi bhi channel upasthit nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, there are regular spots of the membrane, with no separation
 in ranviar ke nodes ko 'laghu akshatantu girika' mana ja saktaa he kyonki unka uddeshy atyadhik sanket kshay ko rokane ke liye sanket ko badhanaa he
 At the end, the axon loses its insulation and spreads to several axon terminals
 ye akshatantu terminal tab duusare varg ke synapces, akshatantu terminal batan ke gathan ke liye samaapt hota he
 These buttons have voltage-activated calcium channels, which play a role in signaling to other neurons
 akshatantu ke aas-paas acshan potenshial kaa prasar or syneptic naub main samaapti par vichaar karne se pehle, un tareekon par vichaar karnaa laabhadaayak hota he jinke dwaara akshatantu girika par acshan potenshial ko aarambh kiya ja saktaa he
 The basic requirement is that the membrane voltage on the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing
 aise kai tareeke hai jisamen yah vidhruvan ho saktaa he
 Action potentials are most commonly initiated by excitatory postsynaptic potentials from the presynaptic neuron
 aamtaur par, tantrikasanchaarak anu, priseneptic neuron dwaara jari kiye jate hai
 These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell
 yah binding, vibhinn prakaar ke aayan channel ko kholti he
 This opening process results in a change in the local permeability of the cell membrane and results in a change in membrane potential
 yadi binding se voltage bad jaataa he to synapse uttejk hota he
 However, it is inhibitory if the bond reduces the voltage
 voltage kam ho yaa bade, yah parivartan jhilli ke aas-paas ke kshetron main niskriy rup se prasaarit hota he 
 Typically, voltage stimulation decays exponentially over time, away from synapse and binding to the neurotransmitter
 uddipan voltage kaa kuch ansh akshatantu girika tak pahunch saktaa he or jhilli kaa itnaa vidhruvan karata he ki ek nayaa acshan potenshial prerit hota he
 In general, the excitatory potential of multiple synapses must work together at the same time to induce a new action potential
 unke sanyukt prayaas ko counter-acting nirodhatmak postsyneptic potenshial dwaara naakaam kiya ja saktaa he
 Neurotransmission can also occur through electrical synapses
 gap jankshan ke rup main ek uttejneey koshika ke bich sambandh ke kaaran, ek acshan potenshial ko ek koshika se duusari koshika main sidhe prasaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Free flow of ions between cells enables rapid non-chemical mediated transmission
 sudhaar channel yah sunishchit karte hai ki acshan potenshial ek vidyut synapse ke madhyam se ek hi disha main chalate hai
 This type of synapse is however uncommon in the human nervous system
 acshan potenshial kaa aayam, use utpann karne vaale vidyut kii raashi se swatantra hota he
 In other words, a large current does not produce a large action potential
 Therefore action potentials are called all-and-nuns, because they are either fully present or not present at all
 Instead, it is the frequency of the action potential that encodes for the intensity of a stimulus
 yah receptor potential ke vipareet he jiskaa aayam ek uddipan kii tivrata par nirbhar hota he
 Sensory neurons consist of an external signal such as pressure, temperature, light or sound with the opening and closing of ion channels, which in turn reduces the ionic permeability of the membrane and its voltage
 yah voltage parivartan phir uttejk yaa niroiumay ho saktaa he or kuch samvedi neurons main, unka sanyukt prabhaav akshatantu girika ko acshan potenshial ko prerit karne ke liye paryaapt vidhruvit kar saktaa he
 Examples in humans include the olfactory receptor neuron and the Myssner corpuscle, which are important for sense of smell and touch, respectively
 haalanki, sabhi samvedi neurons apane bahya sanketon ko acshan potenshial main nahin badalte; kuch main yahaan tak ki akshatantu bhi nahin hota! iske bajaay, ve sanket ko ek tantrikasanchaarak ko jari karne main yaa satat vargeekrut kshamta main parivartit kar sakate hai, donon main koi bhi baad ke neuron ko ek acshan potenshial ko fire karne ke liye prerit kar saktaa he
 For example, in the human ear, hair cell molecules convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of mechanically driven ion channels, which can cause the release of neurotransmitter molecules
 aise hi samaan tareeke se, maanav retina main, praarambhik photoriceptor koshika or koshika kii agali do parat acshan potenshial kaa utpaadan nahin karti; keval kuch amecrin koshika or teesri parat, naadigranthi koshika, acshan potenshial kaa utpaadan karti he, jo optic tantrika tak yatra karti he
 In sensory neurons, action potentials result from an external stimulus
 haalanki, kuch uttejneey koshikaon ko fire karne ke liye aisi kisi prerana kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he: ve apane akshatantu girika ko swatah hi vidhruvit karte hai or ek niyamit dar se ek aantarik lock kii tarah acshan potenshial fire karte hai
 The voltage traces of such cells are known as pacemaker potentials
 hryday main seenonetrial node kii cardiyak pesamekar koshika ek acha udhaaharan pradaan karti he
 Although such a pacemaker potential has a natural rhythm, it can be adjusted by an external inductor; For example, heart rate can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as by signs of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves
 External motors do not result in repetitive firing of the cell but only alter its timing
 kuch maamalon main, frequency kaa viniman adhik jatil ho saktaa he, jo acshan potenshial ke pattern ko saamne laata he, jaise barsting
 The path of the action potential can be divided into five parts: growth phase, peak phase, collapse phase, undershoot phase and finally refractory period
 The membrane potential depolarizes in the growth phase
 jis bindu par vidhruvan band ho jaataa he vah charam charan kehalaata he
 At this stage, the membrane potential is maximized
 iske baad, ek giravat kaa charan aata he
 The membrane potential is highly depolarized at this stage
 anderlaut charan vah bindu he jiske dauraan jhilli kshamta, vishram ke samay kii tulana main asthaayee rup se adhik rinatmak charge ho jaati he
 Finally, the time during which it becomes impossible or difficult to fire a subsequent action potential is called a refractory period, which may overlap with other phases
 acshan potenshial kaa path, do yugmit prabhaavon dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 Voltage-sensitive first ion channels open and close in response to changes in membrane voltage v m
 isse un yanon ke prati jhilli kii pargamyata badal jaati he
 Second, according to the Goldman equation, this change in permeability changes the equilibrium potential e m and, thus, the membrane voltage v m
 The membrane potential, thus, affects permeability, which then further affects membrane potential
 isse sakaaratmak pratikriya kii sambhaavna nirdhaarit hoti he, jo acshan potenshial ke vikaas charan kaa ek mukhya hissaa he
 a complex aspect is that a single ion channel may have multiple internal "gates" that react to changes in v m in opposite ways
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadhyapi badhata v m, voltage ke prati samvedansheel sodium channel main adhikansh get ko kholta he, vah, channel ke niskriyata get ko bhi band karata he, haalaanki thodaa dhire karata he
 Therefore, when Vm is suddenly raised, the sodium channels initially open, but then close due to slow inactivity
 acshan potenshial ke voltage or curent ko uske sabhi charnon main alan loyad hauzgin or andrew huxley dwaara 1952 main sateek rup se chitrit kiya gaya tha, jiske liye unhen 1963 main physiology yaa chikitsa main nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 However, their model only considers two types of voltage sensitive ion channels and makes several assumptions about them, such that their internal gates open and close independently of each other
 vaastaviktaa main, aayan channelon ke kai prakaar hote hai, or ve ek duusare se swatantra rup main hameshaa khulte or band nahin hote hai
 a typical action potential starts at the axon hillock with a sufficiently strong depolarization, such as an inductor that increases
 yah vidhruvan, koshika main aksar atirikt sodium katian ke injection ke kaaran paidaa hota he; ye fatayan ek vyapak kism ke sroton se aa sakate hai, jaise rasinic synapces, samvedi neuron yaa pesamekar potenshial se
 The initial membrane permeability to potassium is low, but higher than other ions, which makes the resting potential close to EK≈-75 mv
 yah vidhruvan, jhilli main sodium or potacium, donon channelon ko kholta he or yanon ko kramshah akshatantu ke andar or baahar pravaahit hone kii anumati detaa he
 If the depolarization is small, the outgoing potassium current overwhelms the incoming sodium current and the membrane depolarizes around its normal resting potential, −70 mv
 haalanki, agar vidhruvan kaaphi bada he, to aavak sodium dhara, jaavak potacium dhara se adhik ho jaati he or ek bhagoda sthiti utpann hoti he: jitna zyada aavak dhara hogi utana hi adhik v m bad jaataa he, jo badale main aavak dhara ko or adhik badha detaa he
 a sufficiently strong depolarization opens voltage-sensitive sodium channels; Increasing permeability to sodium moves v m closer to the sodium equilibrium voltage e Na≈ +55 mv
 badale main badhata voltage or adhik sodium channelon ko kholta he, jo v m ko e Na kii disha main or adhik dhakelta he
 This positive reaction continues until the sodium channels are fully opened and v m is close to ena
 The sharp increase in v m and sodium permeability corresponds to the growth phase of the action potential
 is teevr haalat ke liye mahatvapurn threshold voltage aamtaur par -45 mv ke aasapaas hota he, lekin yah akshatantu kii haal kii gatividhi par nirbhar karata he
 a membrane that has just fired an action potential cannot immediately fire another, because ion channels have not returned to their normal state
 vah avadhi jiske dauraan koi nayaa acshan potenshial fire nahin kiya ja saktaa he use ebsolute rifractory piriad kaha jaataa he
 In the long run, after some ion channels are restored, the axon can be induced to produce other action potentials, but only with a very strong depolarization, eg, −30 mv
 The period during which the action potential is unusually difficult to induce is called the relative refractory period
 vikaas charan kii sakaaratmak pratikriya dhimi ho jaati he or jab sodium aayan channel adhiktam khulte hai to vah ruk jaati he
 At the peak of the action potential, sodium permeability is maximum and the membrane voltage v m is approximately equal to the sodium equilibrium voltage e Na
 haalanki, vahi vardhit voltage jisane shuru main sodium channel ko kholaa tha, vahi unke poron ko band karte hue unhen dhire-dhire band kar detaa he; sodium channel niskriy ho jate hai
 This reduces membrane permeability to sodium, which lowers the membrane voltage back
 usee samay, vardhit voltage, voltage ke prati samvedansheel potacium channel ko kholta he; jhilli kii potacium pargamyata main vruddhi v m ko e k kii ore le jaati he
 Combined, these changes in sodium and potassium permeability cause Vm to rapidly drop down and repolarize the membrane and produce the "collapse phase" of the action potential
 vardhit voltage ne saamaanya se kai adhik potacium channel khol die or inamen se kuch turant us vakt band nahin ho gaye jab jhilli apane saamaanya vishram voltage main waapas aa gai
 In addition, during the action potential, other potassium channels opened up in response to the flow of calcium ions
 jhilli kii potacium pargamyata, kshanik rup se asaamaanya rup se adhik hoti he, jo jhilli voltage v m ko potacium santulan voltage e k ke nazadik le aati he
 Therefore, there is an undershoot or hyperpolarization, in technical parlance called afterhyperpolarization, that lasts until the potassium permeability of the membrane returns to its normal value
 prayek acshan potenshial ke baad ek du:saadhy avadhi hoti he, jise ebsolute rifractory piriad, jiske dauraan ek anya acshan potenshial ko prerit karnaa asambhav hota he or relative refractory piriad, jiske dauraan ek saamaanya-se-majboot prerak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 These two refractory periods are caused by changes in the position of sodium and potassium channel molecules
 sodium channel, jab acshan potenshial ke baad band hote hai, to ve ek "niskriy" avasthaa main pravesh karte hai, jisamen unhen jhilli potenshial ke hote hue bhi kholaa nahin ja saktaa - isse nirpeksh du:saadhy avadhi kaa janm hota he
 Even after a sufficient number of sodium channels change their resting state, it often occurs that a fraction of the potassium channels remain open, making depolarization difficult for the membrane potential and causing a relative refractory period
 
 kyonki potacium channelon kaa ghanatv or upaprakaar, bhinn prakaar ke neurons ke bich bhinn ho saktaa he, saapeksh du:saadhy avadhi ucch rup se asthir hoti he
 The absolute refractory period is largely responsible for the unidirectional propagation of the action potential around the axon
 kisi bhi samay, sakriy rup chhedit bhaag ke peeche akshatantu kaa ptch duhasaadhay he, lekin saamne kaa ptch, haal hi main sakriy nahin kiye jane ke kaaran acshan potenshial se vidhruvan se prerit hone main sakasham he
 The action potential generated on the axon hillock propagates as a wave on the axon
 ek acshan potenshial ke dauraan akshatantu par ek bindu par andar kii ore bahati dharaaen akshatantu par fail jaati hai or apane jhilli ke asann virgon ko vidhruvit kar detii hai
 If strong enough, this depolarization induces a similar action potential in neighboring membrane patches
 is buniyadi tantra ko 1937 main alan loyad haujkin dwaara pradarshit kiya gaya tha
 After crushing or cooling the nerve segments and thus blocking the action potentials, they showed that the action potential reaching one side of the block could elicit another action potential on the other side, provided that the blocked segment was sufficiently small
 ek baar jhilli ke ek ptch par ek acshan potenshial ke hone par, jhilli ptch ko phir se fire karne ke liye thik hone kii jarurat hoti he
 At the molecular level, this absolute refractory period corresponds to the time it takes for the voltage-activated sodium channel to recover from inactivity, that is, to return to its closed form
 There are several types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons, many of them rapidly inactivating and some of them being slowly inactive or not inactive at all; This variability guarantees that there will always be an available source of current for repolarization, even when potassium channels are inactive due to preceding depolarization
 duusari ore, sabhi neuronal voltage-sakriy sodium channel, majboot vidhruvan ke dauraan kai milisecond ke bheetar niskriy ho jate hai, is prakaar agle vidhruvan ko asambhav bana dete hai jab tak ki sodium channel kaa ek mahatvapurn ansh apni band sthiti main waapas nahin laut aata
 haalanki, yah firing kii seemaa ko simit karata he, nirpeksh duhasaadhay avadhi yah sunishchit karti he ki acshan potenshial ek akshatantu se lage hue keval ek hi disha main chale
 ek acshan potenshial kii vajah se andar pravaahit hone vaala curent, akshatantu ke aas-paas donon dishaao main failata he
 However, only the unfired part of the axon can react with an action potential; The part that has just been fired is inactive until the action potential is safely out of range and re-ignites that part
 In normal orthodromic conduction, the action potential is transmitted from the axon hillock to the synaptic knob; Circulation in the opposite direction - known as antidromic conduction - is extremely rare
 haalanki, agar ek prayogshaala akshatantu ko iske bich main prerit kiya jaataa he to akshatantu ke donon bhaag "fresh" hote hai, arthath bina fire ke; tab do acshan potenshial utpann hote hai, jisamen se ek akshatantu girika kii ore yatra karata he or doosraa syneptic naub kii disha main yatra karata he
 The evolutionary need for rapid and effective transduction of electrical signals in the nervous system resulted in the presence of myelin sheaths around the neuronal axon
 melin ek bahu lamailer jhilli he jo akshatantu ko, nodes of renviar kahe jane vaale antaraal dwaara alag kshetron main lapetati he, vah vishesh koshikaon, shwaan koshikaon dwaara utpann hoti he, vishesh rup se paridhiy tantrika tantra main or vishesh rup se kendriya tantrika tantra main oligodandrosite dwaara
 melin shith, inter-node antaraal main jhilli kshamta ko kam kar detaa he or jhilli pratirodh ko badha detaa he or is prakaar ek node se duusare node main acshan potenshial ke ek tej, naatakeey gatividhi kii anumati detaa he
 Myelin action is mainly found in vertebrates, but in some animals without vertebrates, a conforming system has been found, as in some of the shrimp species 

 Not all neurons in vertebrates are myelinated; For example, axons of neurons in the autonomic nervous system are not normally myelinated
 melin, yanon ko melinkrut kshetron main akshatantu se jane yaa aane se bachaata he
 As a general rule, myelin increases the conduction speed of the action potential and makes them more energy efficient
 chaahe oobad-khabad ho yaa naa ho, ek acshan potenshial kii ausat chaalan gati 1 m / s se 100 m / s ke upar tak hoti he or saamaanya rup main akshatantu vyas se adhik hoti he
 Action potentials cannot propagate through the membrane to myelinated regions of the axon
 haalanki, curent ko cytoplasm dwaara le jaaya jaataa he, jo agle 1 yaa 2 node of ranviar ko vidhruvit karne ke liye paryaapt hai
 Instead, the ionic current from one action potential at one node of rainwire provokes another action potential at the next node; This apparent jump of action potentials from one node to another is called dramatic conduction
 haalanki naatakeey chaalan ke tantra ko ralf lily dwaara 1925 main sujhaayaa gaya tha, naatakeey chaalan kaa pehla prayogtmak saboot tasaki ichiji or taiji tekeuchi ne prastut kiya or andrew huxley or robert stemphli ne
 virodhabhas swaroop, bina melinkrut akshatantu main, acshan potenshial thik bagal kii jhilli main ek anya ko bhadakaata he or lagaataar ek lahar kii tarah akshatantu main neeche jaataa he
 Myelin has two important advantages: fast conduction speed and energy efficiency
 For axons larger than the minimum diameter, myelinacre typically increases the conduction velocity of the action potential tenfold
 iske vipareet, ek diye gaye chaalan veg ke liye, melinkrut fibre apane bina melinkrut samakakshon kii tulana main chote hote hai
 For example, the action potentials run roughly at the same speed in a myelinated Frog axon and in an unmyelinated giant squid axon, but the Frog axon has a diameter of about 30 times smaller and a 1000-fold smaller cross-sectional area
 iske alaava, chunki ynic curent, nodes of renviar main simit hoti hai, bahut kam yanon kaa "risaav" jhilli ke paar hota he, jisase chayapachay urja kii bachat hoti he
 This savings is an important selective advantage, as the human nervous system uses 20% of the body's metabolic energy
 akshatantu ke melinkrut segment kii lambaai, naatakeey pravaahakatva kii safalataa ke liye mahatvapurn he
 They must be as long as possible to maximize the speed of conduction, but not so long that the incoming signal is so weak that it is unable to generate an action potential at the next node of rainwear
 prakruti main, melinkrut kshetra aam taur par niskriy rup se prasaarit sanket ke liye yah kaaphi hota he kam se kam do nodes ke liye yatra karte samay or paryaapt aayam banaae rakhata he taaki duusare yaa tisare node par ek acshan potenshial ko fire kiya ja sake
 Thus, the safety factor of dramatic conductance is high, which allows transmission to bypass the node in case of injury
 haalanki, acshan potenshial, kuch sthanon par samay se pehle hi samaapt ho saktaa he jahaan suraksha kaarak kam he, yahaan tak ki bina melinkrut neurons main bhi; ek saamaanya udhaaharan he, akshatantu kaa vibhaajan bindu jahaan yah do akshatantu main vibhajit hota he
 Some diseases impair myelin and dramatically impair conduction and decrease the flow velocity of the action potential
 iskaa sabase acha gyaat rup he ekaadhik kaathinya, jisamen melin kaa tuutan samanvit gatividhiyon ko bigaadta he
 The flow of currents within an axon can be described quantitatively by cable theory and by its interpretation, such as the complementary model
 The cable theory was developed by Lord Kelvin in 1855 to format transatlantic telegraph cable and was shown to be relevant to neurons in 1946 by Hodgkin and Rushton
 saadhaaran cabel siddhant main, neuron ko vidyut rup se niskriy mana jaataa he, bilkul belanaakaar sancharan cabel, jise ek aanshik antar sameekaran dwaara varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 Where V, t is the voltage across the membrane with the time and length of a neuron in the x position and where λ and τ are the characteristic lengths and times at which the voltage decays in response to the inductor
 uparokt circuit aarekh ke sandarbh main, in paimaanon ko prati unit pratirodh or sandharitra se nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 These times and lengths can be used to understand the dependence of conduction velocity on the diameter of a neuron in myelin fibers
 udhaaharan ke liye, samay paimaana τ, jhilli pratirodh r m or dharita c m, donon ke saath badhata he
 As the capacitance increases, more charge needs to be transferred to generate a given transmembrane voltage
 isi tarah ke tareeke main, yadi pratirodh prati unit aantarik lambaai r i, kisi anya kii tulana main ek akshatantu se kam he,, sthanik kshay lambaai λ lambi ho jaati he or ek acshan potenshial kaa pravaah veg badhanaa chahie
 If the transmembrane resistance rm increases, it reduces the average "leakage" across the membrane, similarly prolonging λ, which increases the flow velocity
 saamaanya rup se, jo acshan potenshial syneptic naub tak pahunchate hai ve ek tantrikasanchaarak ko syneptic cleft main sravit hone ko prerit karte hai
 Neurotransmitters are small molecules that can open ion channels in a postsynaptic cell, most axons have the same neurotransmitter at all their termini

 This complex process is inhibited by the neurotoxins tetanospasmine and botulinum toxin which are responsible for tetanus and botulism, respectively
 kuch synapces, tantrikasanchaarak "bichauliya" ko hataa dete hai or priseneptic or postsyneptic koshikaon ko jod dete hai
 When an action potential reaches such synapses, ionic currents that flow into the presynaptic cell can cross through barrier membranes and enter the postsynaptic chamber from the pore called coenxin
 is prakaar, priseneptic acshan potenshial kii kshamta kaa ynic dharaaen, sidhe postsyneptic cell ko protsaahit kar sakati hai
 Electrical synapses allow fast transmission because they do not require the slow diffusion of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft

 However, acetylcholine is not bound but dissociates and is hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme located in the synapse

 To prevent this control, some poisons inactivate acetylcholinesterase, such as the nerve agents sarin and tabun, and the insecticides diazinone and malathion

 The action potential in a normal skeletal muscle cell is similar to the action potential in neurons

 The resting potential before the action potential is typically −90mv, which is somewhat more negative than typical neurons

 The action potential that is common in animal and plant action potentials is the simultaneous release of positive potassium ions, hence osmotic loss of salt, while the animal action potential is neutral on an osmotic basis, when an equal amount of incoming sodium and outgoing potassium Cancels each other on an osmotic basis

 Action potentials are found in whole multicellular organisms, including plants, non-vertebrates such as insects, and vertebrates such as snakes and mammals
 Sponges appear to be the main community of multicellular eukaryotes that do not transmit action potentials, although some studies have suggested that these organisms have some form of electrical signal

 The integration of its various dendritic signals on the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of calculation, which is used to biologically central pattern generators in artificial neural networks
 acshan potenshial ke adhyayan ke liye nai prayogtmak vidhiyon ke vikaas kii aavashyaktaa he
 Early work before 1955 focused on three goals: separating signals from single neurons or axons, developing fast, sensitive electronics, and contraction of electrodes so that the voltage inside a single cell could be recorded
 pehali samasya ko squid jinas loligo ke neurons akshatantu ke adhyayan se hal kiya gaya tha
 The diameter of these axons is quite large and they can be seen with the naked eye, making them easy to remove

 The second problem was addressed with the significant development of clamp voltages, which allowed the study of ionic current inherent in the action potential separately and eliminated one main source of electronic noise, current IC that is connected to capacitor C
 chunki dharaa transamembrane voltage Vm ke badlaav ke c samay dar ke samaan hoti he, samaadhaan ek aisa circuit dizin karnaa tha jo v m ko sthir rakhe, chaahe jhilli main koi bhi dhara bah rahi ho
 Thus, the current required to keep v m constant is a direct reflection to determine the value of current flowing through the membrane

 The third problem is to obtain a small electrode that is small enough to record voltage, without disturbing it in a single axon, which was solved in 1949 with the invention of the glass micropeptide electrode, which was developed by other researchers Adopted early

 Such inhibitors of ion channels do an important research work, but allow scientists to do by channels specific contributions, thus they can separate other channels and purify ion channels in their concentration action
 Can also be performed by or by affinity chromatography

 An important element of television and radio serials is the ever-expanding expansion of their stories, in which new stories begin within the main storyline and then evolve over several episodes and then culminate

 yahan buddha dharm se sambandhit chithran evam shilpkaaree ke utkrisht namoonay milte hai
 Live illustrations are also available with them
 yah guphaayen ajanta naamak gaanv ke sannikat hi sthit he, jo ki maharashtra ke aurangabad jile main he
 Ajanta Caves have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983
 " According to "national Geographic": The flow of faith was such that almost all Buddhist temples, including Ajanta for centuries, seem to have been built under the rule and shelter of Hindu kings
 guphaayen ek ghaney jangal se ghiri, ashv naal aakaar ghati main ajanta gaanv se 31⁄2 kimi dur bani he
 The village is 106 km away from Aurangabad city of Maharashtra

 In the foothills of this valley, the hill stream Vaghur flows
 yahan kul 29 guphaayen hai, jo ki nadi dwaara nirmit ek prapaat ke dakshin main sthit he
 Their elevation from the river ranges from 35 to 110 feet
 ajanta kaa math jaisaa samooh he, jisamen kai vihaar evam chaityas grih hai, jo ki do charnon main bane hai
 The first phase is mistakenly called the Hinayana phase, which is related to the Hinayana faith of Buddhism
 vastutah hinayan sthaviravaad ke liye ek shabd he, jisamen buddha kii moort rup se koi nishedh nahin he
 Ajanta's cave numbers 9, 10, 12, 13 15A were discovered at this stage
 in khudaayiyon main buddha ko stupa yaa math rup main darshit kiya gaya he
 Second phase excavations were discovered after nearly three centuries of stability
 is charan ko bhi galat rup main mahayan charan 9 buddha dharm kaa doosraa bada dhada, jo ki kamatar kattar he, evam buddha ko sidhe gaay aadi rup main chitron yaa shilpon main darshit karne kii anumati detaa he
 ) Many people call this phase Vakataka phase
 yah vatsagulm shakha ke shasit vansh vaakatak ke naam par he
 The construction date of this second phase is disputed among many academics
 haal ke varshon main kuch bahumat ke sanket ise paanchavin shatabdi main maanane lage hai
 According to Walter M
 Spink, an Ajanta expert, the Mahayan caves were built between 462–480 AD
 mahayan charan kii guphaayen sankhya hai 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, evam 29
 Cave number 8 was considered a cave of Hinayana phase for a long time, but at present it has been declared as Mahayan on the basis of facts
 mahayan, hinayan charan main do chaityagrih mili the, jo gupha sankhya 9 va 10 main the
 The cave numbers of this phase are 12, 13, 15 viharas
 mahayan charan main teen chaityas grih the jo sankhya 19, 26, 29 main the
 From the very beginning, the last cave was uninhabited
 anya sabhi mili guphaayen 1-3, 5-8, 11, 14-18, 20-25, va 27-28 vihaar hai
 The viharas found in the excavation are of several sizes, the largest being 52 feet, almost all square
 inke rup main bhi bhinnata he
 Many are simple, many are ornate, some are made of pavilions, and many are not
 sabhi viharon main ek aavashyak ghatak he— ek vrahat haul cameraa
 Among the Vakataka stages, many have not had holy places, because they were made only for religious gatherings and accommodation; Later holy places were added to them
 phir to yah ek maanak ban gaya
 The statue of Buddha in a central hall in this sacred place was often seated in the dharma-chakra-pramana posture
 jin gufaaon main naveenatam visheshtaayen hai, vahaan kinare kii deevaaron, dwaar mandapon par or praangan main gaun pavitra sthal bhi bane dikhte hai
 The walls of many viharas are decorated with carvings
 deevaaron or chhaton par bhitti chithran kiya hua he
 With the difference in Buddhist thought in the first century, Buddha was given the status of a deity and worshiped him
 parinamtah buddha ko puja-archana kaa kendra banaaya gaya; jisase mahayan kii utpatti hui
 In the past, academics divided the caves into three groups, but were rejected due to evidence and research
 us siddhanth ke anusaar 200 i purv se 200 i tak ek samooh, dwitiya samooh chhathi shatabdi kaa or tritiy samooh saatvin shatabdi kaa mana jaataa tha
 The expression cave temple used by the anglo-indians for the viharas was considered inappropriate
 ajanta ek prakaar kaa mahavidhyalay math tha
 Hiuen Tsang states that Dinnag, a famous Buddhist philosopher, philosopher who was the author of several texts on logic, lived here
 yah abhi anya saakshyon se pramanit hona shesh he
 At its peak, the Viharas had the ability to accommodate hundreds
 yahan shikshak or chaatr ek saath rahete the
 It is very sad that no cave of Vakataka stage is complete
 yah is kaaran hua ki shaasha vaakatak vansh ekaek shaktiviheen ho gaya, jisase uski praja bhi sankat main aa gayi
 Due to this, all activities were interrupted and stopped suddenly
 yah samay ajanta kaa antim kaal rahaa
 This is a first step and has no meaning in the sequence of other caves
 yah ashwanal aakaar kii dhaal par purvi ore se pratham gupha he
 According to Spink one of the last caves built at this site is towards the end of the Vakataka phase
 haalaanki koi shilalekhith sakshya upasthit nahin hai; phir bhi yah mana jaataa he ki vaakatak raja harisena is uttam sangrakshit gupha ke sangrakshak rahe hon
 The main reason for this is that Harisena was not initially involved in the protection of Ajanta, but could not stay away from them for a long time, because this site was full of activities during his reign and his Buddhist subjects were given this sacred work of that Hindu king
 Could be happy to shelter
 yahan darshit kai vishay rajsik hai
 This cave has very elaborate carving work, which also has many highly embossed crafts
 yahan buddha ke jivan se sambandhit kai ghatnaayen ankit hai, saath hi anek alankaran namoonay bhi hai
 Its two-storied gate-pavilion, which was visible until the nineteenth century, is now extinct
 is gupha ke aage ek khulaa sthaan tha, jiske donon ore khambhedaar galiyare the
 Its level was relatively high
 iske dwaar mandap ke donon ore kothiyaan hai
 The absence of the pillared cells at the end suggests that this pavilion was not built with the last phase of Ajanta, when the pillared cells had become a regular part
 porch kaa adhikansh kshetra kabhi muraal se bharaa rahaa hoga, jiske kai avshesh abhi bhi shesh hai
 There are three gateways here, one central and two sideways
 in dwarpathon ke bich do vargakar khidkiyaan taraashi hui he, jinase antas ujjwalit hota tha
 Each wall of the hall is about 40 feet long and 20 feet high
 baarah stambh andar ek vargakar coloned banaate hai jo chat ko sahaara dete hai, saath hi deevaaron ke saath-saath ek galiyara-sa banaate hai
 a gargantuan image is carved on the back wall, in which the Buddha is shown seated in his dharma-chakra-vimana posture
 peeche, baayin evam daayin diwaar main chaar-chaar kamare bane hai
 These walls are full of paintings, which are in a perfect state of preservation
 darshit drishy adhiktar upadeshon, dharmik evam alankaran ke hai
 Their subjects are related to Jataka tales, life of Gautama Buddha, etc
 gupha sankhya 1 se lagi gupha san 2, deevaaron, chhaton evam stambhon par sangrakshit apni chitrakaari ke liye prasiddh he
 It looks very beautiful and looks almost similar to the cave number, but is in a far better state of conservation
 is gupha main do dwaar-mandap hai, jo ki sankhya 1 se bahut alag he
 Rather, the carving of the panels also looks different from that
 is gupha ko sahaara diye do achche khaase mote stambh hai, jo ki baari nakkashi se alankrita hai
 Yes, it definitely resembles the first cave in size, shape and land plan
 saamne kaa porch donon ore stambhon se yukt prakoshthon se yukt he
 Formerly, rooms made up of vacant spaces were necessary when the latter required space, as the latter increased the need for more accommodation

 Mural paintings on its roofs and walls have been published in sufficient quantity
 inamen buddha ke janm se purv bodhisattva rup ke anya janmon kii kathaayen hai
 There is a doorway between the back walls of the porch, which leads to the hall

 He has produced and directed several plays by Indian and Western writers in Urdu and English
 usne gaalib institute, dilli, dwaara urdu drama ke liye ham sab gaalib aword or kul hindu bahadur shah jafar award praapt kiya
 Zahida Zaidi was born on 4 January 1930 in Meerut, India
 vah paanch bahanon main sabase kam umr kii thi
 Her father, S
 M
 Mustaehsin Zaidi had been teaching mathematics at the University of Cambridge and was a well-known lawyer in Meerut
 jab zadi bahut choti tha, tab uske pita kii maut ho gai thi
 His grandfather, KG Saikulan, was a noted social reformer, while his maternal grandfather, Maulana Khwaja Altaf Hussain Hali, was an Urdu poet
 uski ek badi bahan, sajida jaidi, jo uske do maheene baad mar gai, bhi ek prasiddh kavi or aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay main shiksha kii professor thi; saahitiyik samudaay main donon ko "jaidi bahanon" ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 Although she was from conservative Muslim society, she and Sajida had stopped wearing burqas as a student at AMU and she used to go to class on her bicycle
 uski vidhwaa mata ne parivaar ko meerut se panipat sthanantarit kar diya or apni ladakiyon ko eemyu main adhyayan karne ke liye bheja, kyonki yah ek pramukh shaikshik santhaan tha
 At AMU, Zaidi earned a BA and an MA degree in English language
 unhone cambridge vishvavidhyalay main ek sanshodhit oversij merit scolership ke saath padhai karte hue england main apana academik karier jari rakhaa, jahaan unhone angreji main bie onors or eme kii degree praapt kii

 1964 main unhen eemyu vibhaag main reader niyukt kiya gaya tha
 She became a professor of English in 1983 and retired in 1988
 isse pehle, 1971-72 ke dauraan, unhone shimla main indian institute of advanced studies main ek faillo ke rup main kaam kiya
 Mountain languages are spoken from the east of Kashmir to Nepal in the southern part of the Himalayan ranges
 grearsan ne aadhunik bhartiya aryabhashaon kaa vargeekaran karte samay pahari bhashaaon kaa ek swatantra samudaay mana he
 Chatterjee has declared them to be based on Paishachi, Darad or Khas Prakrit and the influence of Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages of Rajasthan in Madrika
 ek naveen mat ke anusaar kam se kam madhya pahari bhashaaon kaa udgam shauraseni praakrit he, jo rajasthani kaa mul bhi he
 The phonology of the Pahari languages, sound group, grammar, etc
 have been imprinted on many ethnic levels
 yaksha, kinnar, kiraat, naag, khas, shaq, arya aadi vibhinn jatiyon kii bhashaagat visheshtaayen praytn karne par khoji ja sakati hai jinamein ab yahan arya-aryetar tatv paraspar ghul mil gaye hai
 Historically it is known that in ancient times, some of their different forms were mostly oral
 madhyakaal main yah bhubhag rajasthani bhashaa bhashiyon ke adhik sampark main aayaa or aadhunik kaal main avaagaman kii suvidha ke kaaran hindi bhashaai tatv yahan pravesh karte ja rahe hai
 In a way the behavior of Pahari languages has become limited to domestic colloquialism, correspondence etc
 pahari bhashaaon main darad bhashaaon kii kuch dhvanyatmak visheshtaayen milti hai jaise ghosh mahapraan ke sthaan par aghosh alpapraan dhwani ho janaa
 The name of the western and central hill region was in the ancient times the editorlaksha
 yahan madhyakaal main gurjaron evam anya rajput logon kaa avaagaman hota rahaa jiskaa mukhya kaaran musalamaani akraman tha
 Therefore, in local languages, most of the "n" is targeted instead of "n" and the incipient tendency of non-intransitive words is a sign of Rajasthani influence
 purvi hindi ko bhi ekaadhik pravritiyaan madhya pahari bhashaaon main vidyaman hai kyonki yahan kaa katyur rajvansh suryavanshi ayodhya nareshon se sambandh rakhata tha
 On this basis, the relation of the Pahari languages with the semi-magadhi-kshetra also becomes clear
 inke vartmaan swaroop par vichaar karte hue do tatv mukhyat: saamne aate hai
 One is that they have different characteristics of Pahari languages from Hindi language
 duusare kuch tatv donon ke samaan hai
 Somewhere Hindi words are used alternatively with local words and elsewhere Hindi words are taking the place of local words
 khadi boli ke madhyam se kuch videshi shabd, jaise "hajaamat", "aspataal", "feeta", "sip", "dagdar" aadi bhi chal pade hai
 Three distinctions of Pahari languages can be determined: ise nepali athwa "khaskura" bhi kehete hai
 "gorkhali" is under this
 isamen likhit sahitya paryaapt he
 They are spoken in Kumaon and Garhwal, hence the names "kumaoni" and "garhwali" are famous on this basis
 uttar pradesh ke saat parvaty jile inke kshetra hai or inhen bolanewaalon kii sankhya lagbhag 16 lakh he
 The Kumaoni language is used in the districts of Nainital, Almora and Pithoragarh
 iskaa kshetra is samay lagbhag 8000 vargamil main vistrut he tathaa san 1951 kii janaganana ke anusaar ise bolanewaalon kii sankhya lagbhag 570,008 he
 Hindi is used as a second language
 is kaaran kumaunni hindi khadi boli ke atyadhik nikat aa gai he
 Grammatically, pronouns - I, you, we, you, u, u, are used
 sambandh kaarak bahuvachan kaa rup "unako" na hokar "unar" hota he
 Like in Hindi, only two genders are used in Kumaoni and this sexuality is not only based on the distinction of masculinity, femininity, but also on the size and nature of the object
 vachan do hai, tathaa hindi kii praaia: sabhi dhaatuen milti hai
 Gradation, and syntax are also similar
 aarambh main karta ant main kriyaapad rahata he
 Adverb also comes before the verb like in Hindi
 phir bhi kumaunni main kuch dhvaniyaan khadi boli hindi kii apeksha vishisht hai
 From the point of view of the vowels, the sounds Hrasva "aa", Harsva "A", Harsva "ae", Harsva "O" and Harsva "au" can be seen
 is bhed se shabdaarthon kaa antar ho gaya he
 For example, the word "kawan" means in Kumaoni - the word "kala" and "kava" means "kaal" - meaning death
 vyanjanon main vishesh "na" tathaa vishesh "l" kii uplabdhi hoti he
 Words like "kan", "bhanan" have a distinctive "no" sound which is pronounced towards certain rhythms
 vishesh "l" varna gangoli tathaa kaali kumaun kii boliyon main praapt hoti he
 There are eight dialects of Kumaoni - Khasrajia, Kumayyan, Pachai, Danpuria, Soormali, Sherali, Gangola, Bhotia
 kumaunni bhashaa kii lipi devanagari he
 Its oral literature is very rich, although written literature is also no less important
 gadhwali bhashaa main abhi pracheen tatv kumaunni kii apeksha surakshit hai
 It is practiced in district Garhwal, Tehri, Chamoli and Uttar Kashi
 yah kshetra lagbhag 10,000 vargamil he tathaa gadhwali bhashaa bhashiyon kii sankhya lagbhag 10 lakh
 There are traffic difficulties due to geographical reasons
 isliye pahadiyo ke donon ore rahanewaalon athwa ek hi nadi ke aarpaar rahanewaalon ke bhashaagat prayogon main visheshtaayen ubhar ai hai
 Tibetan in the dialects of the north, and the Kumauni influence towards the east is evident because the boundaries of these areas are mixed
 rajput jatiyon kaa nivas hone ke kaaran gadhwali par najasthani prabhaav to he hi, iske dakshin-pashchim kii ore khadi boli bhi apana prabhaav daalati ja rahi he
 Some characteristics of Garhwali language are visual
 iskaa jhukaav dirghatv kii ore he at: swaron main e, i, o, ou, kii dhvaniyaan, jinka deergh rup pradhan he, adhik prayukt hoti hai
 The tendencies of resonance are relatively low
 kuch aise shabd milte hai jo pracheen bhashaaon se chale aae hai jaise "mukh" ke arth main "gichcho" shabd
 It is possible that many of the received words are remnants of the oldest castes
 vyakaran kii drushti se gadhwali main ek dantagra "l" dhwani pai jaati he jo anyatra kahin nahin milti
 In verb forms, "o" or "ava" is added by omitting the final "a" of the metal, such as running
 lingabhed bhi pray: niyamit nahin
 Much attention is given to the shortness of things, gravity
 anek shabdon ke ekvachan, bahuvachan rup samaan chalate hai
 The characteristics of the idols "L" and "N" in the pronunciation are visual
 sthanbhed se gadhwali kii nau pramukh boliyaan hai - srinagariy, salaani, manjhkumaiyaan, gangavariy, badhaani, rathi, dasauliya, lobhiya or rarvalty
 The main difference seems to be the pronunciation
 gadhwali bhashaa kaa bhi maukhik sahitya mahatv rakhata he
 This is the third distinction of Pahari languages
 vastut: yah anek boliyon kaa samuhik naam he
 These dialects are spoken in Jonsar Bawar, Shimla, north-east-frontier Punjab, Kullu Valley, Chamba etc
 in sabhi boliyon kaa sahitya likhit rup main praapt nahin, is kaaran bhashaa vaigyanik khoj bahut kam ho pai he
 Till now the bids that can be fixed under this, their area is about 14 thousand square miles and the number of ballers is usually 16 lakhs
 inamen mukhya hai - sirmauri, jonsari, kului, champali, andiyaali or bhadravahee, aadi
 Most of the folklore and stories are popular in these dialects
 kului tathaa chambali par idhar kuch kaary hua he
 The region of Kului is, most likely, the area of the ancient Kunind waters that ruled here
 is samay yah boli kullu ghati se lekar himachal pradesh ke mahasu jile tak boli jaati he
 Champali is notable for its melodiousness and due to location differences it also gets "bhatiali", "churahi", etc
 variations
 mandiyaali suket main boli jaati he jabaki badhati solan kii ore
 There is a behavior of Quthali in the foursome of Shimla
 pehle pashchimi pahari kii ye sabhi boliyaan takkari lipi main likhi jaati thim kintu ab devanagari kaa prayog hota he
 Hoplopterus indicus Lobivanellus indicus Lobivanellus goensistringa indica Sarcogrammus indicus tittibh varg kaa ek prasiddh pakshi
 It is also called Karbanak, Long, Kharama, Panavik etc
 iske nar or maadaa donon hi ek hi rangarup ke hote hai
 This bird is about 16 inches tall
 sharir kaa rang raakhipan liye hota he, us par gadhi bhuri lakeer or chihn hote hai
 The back spots are dense and scattered at the bottom
 aankh par hokar ek kaali dhari sir ke bagal tak aati he
 It has a light brown streak at the top and bottom
 daine bhure, dum raakh ke rang kii or neeche kaa hissaa safed hota he
 The underside of the neck and tail are lalachhun brown and thick brown stripes standing on the chest
 aankh chatak pili or chonch tathaa taange pili hoti he
 This garden is often near the gardens and forests where there are dry pools and bushes of Narkul and Sarpat
 yah ekadam bhoomi par rahanevaala pakshi he or apana sara samay khule maidan main ghumkar bitaata he
 It rotates at night instead of day for its Khoorak
 apane matamaile rang ke kaaran logon kaa dhyaan isaki ore tab tak aakrisht nahin ho paata jab tak yah aawaaj kar bhaagta yaa udata nahin
 At the time of danger, it covers and lurks in the ground
 saamanyat: yah akele yaa jode main rahata he
 Its main food is insect spiders
 google khoj yaa google web khoj web par khoj kaa ek ingine he, jiskaa swaamitv google ink ke paas he or yah web par sabase zyada upyog kiya jane vaala khoj ingine he
 Through its various services, Google receives several hundred million different queries per day
 google khoj kaa mukhya uddeshy anya samagriyon, jaise google chitra khoj ke mukaable webprushthon se saamagree kii khoj karnaa he
 Google search was originally developed in 1997 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin
 google khoj mul shabd khoj kshamta se pare kam se kam 22 vishesh suvidhaayen pradaan karata he
 These include synonyms, weather forecasts, time zones, stock quotes, maps, earthquake data, movie showtimes, airports, home listings, and sports scores
 
 yahaan ke daayre sahit ankon, keemton, taapmaana, dhan / ikai roopantaranon, gananaa -pi / 2), package trekking, patent, kshetra code, or pradarshit prishthon kaa bhashaa anuwaad jaisi vishesh suvidhaayen uplabdh hai
 The order of search results on Google's search results pages) is based in part on a priority rank called a "pagerank"
 prathagat khoj ke liye google khoj bulian operataron ke upyog: jaise: apvarjan, shaamil kiye jane, vikalp or wildcard ke jariye kai tarah ke vikalp pradaan karata he
 a large part of Google's success is due to a patented algorithm called page rank, which matches the search formula to rank web pages
 khoj ke parinaamon kii ranking kii pehle kii mukhya shabd aadhaarit paddati, jiskaa upyog kai khoj injanon main kiya gaya, kabhi google kii tulana main zyada lokapriy thi, vah pejon kii rank is aadhaar par tay karti thi ki kitni baar prishth main khoj ke shabd ko doharaaya gaya he yaa kitni majbootee se khoj ke shabd prayek parinamswaroop prishth ke bheetar jude hue hai
 The Page Rank algorithm instead analyzes human-generated links, assuming that web pages associated with many important pages can themselves be important
 elgorithm pejon ke liye punaravarti score kii gananaa karata he or yah unase jude pannon kii pej rank ke tulit jod par aadhaarit he
 Page rank can be considered to be a good correlate of concepts of human importance
 pegerank ke alaava, google ne pichley kai varshon main parinaam soochiyon par pejon kii ranking nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai anya gupt maapdand apanaaye hai, jo lagbhag 200 vibhinn sanketakon ke rup main bataaye jate hai
 Their details are kept secret to avoid spammers and to retain an edge over Google's competitors
 google dwaara anukramit web pejon ke sateek pratishat gyaat nahin he, kyonki vastav main gananaa bahut mushkil he
 Google not only indexes and secretly stores web pages, but also captures "snapshots" of other types of files, including pdfs, Word content, Excel spreadsheets, Flash swfs, plain text files, and others
 text oresdablyooeffilon ke maamalon ko chhodkar gupt rup se sangrah kiya gaya sanskaran achtmal kaa ek roopantaran hota he, jisase unhen samakaksh darshneeyata kaa anuprayog kiye bina fil padhane kii anumati milti he
 By setting a pre-selected language and using "safe Search" filtering technology, users can optimize the search engine and determine the number of results shown on each page
 is variyataon kaa sangrah karne ke liye upyogkartaaon kii mashiinon par lambey samay kii kukies ke liye google kii aalochana bhi kii jaati he, jo ek ranneeti he, jisase unhen upyogkarta ke khoj ke niyamon kaa pataa lagane or ek saal se zyada samay tak data ko barkaraar rakhane main sakasham banaata hai
 For any query, the first 1000 results can be shown in a maximum number of 100 per page
 parinaamon kii sankhya nirdisht karne kii kshamta keval tabhi uplabdh ho paati he, jab "twarit khoj" kaa vikalp sakasham nahin kiya gaya ho
 If "quick Search" is enabled, only 10 results will be displayed, unlike the setting
 apni vishaal suchi ke baavjood ullekhneey maatra main data online database par uplabdh hote hai, jin tak prashnon ke jariye pahunchaa ja saktaa he, kadiyon ke jariye nahin
 This so-called invisible or deep web is minimally covered by Google and other search engines
 deep web main pustkaalay suchi, sarkaron ke aadhikarik vidhaayi dastavej, phone book yaa duusari samagriyaan hoti hai, jo ek prashn par pratikriya ke liye gatisheel rup se taiyaar kii jaati hai
 In some countries, some links are forbidden due to confidentiality

 Since Google is the most popular search engine, many webmasters have become eager to influence the Google ranking of their websites
 salaahkaaron kaa ek udyog khadaa ho gaya he, jo google or anya khoj injanon par websiton kii ranking main vruddhi main madad karata he
 This field, called search engine optimization, attempts to detect patterns in search engine listings and then develops a methodology to improve rankings by attracting more searchers to its client's sites
 khoj ingine anukulan main "on pej" karkon or of pej anukulan kaarak, donon shaamil hote hai
 a common idea to influence Google's contextual algorithm is to "include keywords targeted to different pages on the page, especially in the title element and body copy xxrep 4 
 More keywords are found, although Google's spam The test algorithm causes the suspect to be suspicious
 google ne website swaamiyon ke liye dishanirdesh prakashit kiye hai, jo vaid anukulan salaahkaaron kaa upyog kar apni ranking badha sakate hai
 Google search involves a series of localized websites
 unamem se sabase adhik upyog kii jane vaali site google
com he, jo duniya kii sabase zyada kholi jane vaali website he
 Some of its features include a dictionary link to more searches by including dictionary words
 isamen aap apni khoj ke jitne adhik parinaam hasil karte hai, ve duusari khojon kii kadiyaan or anya vishay ban jate hai
 Google's search engine generally accepts a simple text and places the user's text in a sequence of word searches, which will usually be words that come as a result, but no bullion operators: such as for an idiom The quotation mark can also use a prefix "+", "-" or one of several advanced operators, such as "site", for a qualified word
 "google search basics" ke webpejon main in atirikt prashnon main se prayek or vikalp kaa varnan kiya gaya he)
 Google's Advanced Search Web form has a number of additional fields that allow searchers to qualify to search through a category such as the first retrieval date
 sabhi unnat prashn aamtaur par atirikt yogya shabdon ke rup main niyamit prashnon main badal jate hai
 Google applies the query extension to the search query presented and changes it to a question that will actually be used to retrieve the results
 With page ranking, Google deliberately hides the exact details of the algorithm, but they certainly include the following changes: google ke hompej par "main saubhagyashaalee mahasoos kar rahaa hum" label laga ek batan shaamil hai
 When the user clicks on the button, the user will be taken directly to the first search result, bypassing the search engine's result page
 It entails the idea that if a user "feels lucky", the search engine will return to the exact match for the first time without the page being accessed through search results
 According to a study by Tom Chavez of "rapt", Google spends $ 110 million annually on this feature, because 1% of all searchers use the feature and they ignore all ads
 30 oktober 2009 ko kuch upyogkartaaon ke liye "main bhaagyashaalee mahasoos kar rahaa hum" batan niyamit khoj batan ke saath google ke mukhya prishth se hataa diya gaya tha
 In place of both buttons, it was written that "this space is intentionally left blank
 " jab mouse ko vahaan le jaaya gaya to text feekaa pad gaya or vaanchit shabdon ko saath khoj ke sthaan main bharne or inter batan dabaane se saamaanya khoj kii kaaryakshmata hasil kii gai
 a Google spokesperson explained that "this is just a test and a way for us to measure what our users would prefer with a more simple search interface

 The Bible is the cornerstone of Christianity and the holiest scripture of Christians
 iske do bhaag hai : purvavidhan or navvidhan 
 The first half of the Bible is also the scripture of the Old Testament Jews
 bible ishwarprerit he kintu use apaurushey nahin kaha ja saktaa
 God has inspired various writers of the Bible in such a way that they can be called their own creations even though they are Godsized
 ishwar ne bolkar unase bible nahin likhavai
 He certainly tended to write with the inspiration of God, but he has written it according to the characteristics of his culture, style and ideology
 at: bible ishwariya prerana tathaa maanviya parishram donon kaa sammilit parinaam he
 The history and account of what God did for mankind and the Jews and the reaction of man to it is the theme of the Bible
 bible gudh darshanik satyon kaa sankalan nahin he balki isamen dikhalaayaa gaya he ki ishwar ne maanav jati kii mukti kaa kya prabandh kiya he
 In fact, the Bible is a history of the implementation of divine liberation that began in the Old Testament and was edited by Jesus in the New Testament
 at: bible ke donon bhaagon main ghanishtha sambandh he
 The events of the life of Jesus are laid out by the events of the Old Testament
 new testament main dikhalaayaa gaya he ki muktividhan kis prakaar isa ke vyaktitv, chamatkaaron, shiksha, maran tathaa punarutthan dwaara sampann hua he; kis prakaar isa ne carch kii sthapana kii or is carch ne apane praarambhik vikaas main isa ke jivan kii ghatnaon ko kis drushti se dekha he ki unamem se kya nishkarsh nikaala he
 Incidentally, things related to cosmic knowledge have also come up in the Bible; There is a full impression of the immediate assumptions on them because the Bible hardly wants to give any direction about them
 maanav jati ke itihaas kii ishwariya vyakhya prastut karnaa or dharm evam mukti ko samajhnaa, yahi bible kaa pradhan uddeshy he, bible kii tatsambandhi shiksha main koi bhranti nahin ho sakati
 There is also a description of the sin of humans at many places
 aisa aacharan anukaraniya adarsh ke rup main nahin prastut hua he kintu uske dwaara spasht ho jaataa he ki manushya kitne kalushit hai or unako ishwar kii mukti kii kitni aavashyaktaa he
 It describes ancient Judaism and the stories of Jewish people, mythological stories, myths etc
 isaki mulbhasha ibrani or arami thi
 It is after Christ, which was written by the disciples of Jesus
 isamen isa kii jeevani, upadesh or shishyon ke kaary likhe gayi hai
 Its native language was some Aramaic and mostly colloquial Ancient Greek
 isamen khaas taur par chaar shubhasandesh hai jo isa kii jeevani kaa unke chaar shishyon ke naam se kisi or ke dwaara varnan he : matti, luka, yuhanna or marakus
 The religion book of Judaism is also the Bible, but it contains only the Old Testament
 bible kul milakar 66 granthon kaa sankalan he - purvavidhan main 39 tathaa navvidhan main 27 granth hai
 Holy bibleaudio Bible Project navvidhan ke pratham paanch granth aitihaasik hai arthath chaaron susamachar tathaa acts aav di aposles ke patt shishyon ke kaary
 The last book is called Apocalypse
 isamen susamachar lekhak sant yohan pratikatmak style main carch ke bhavishya tathaa muktividhan kii parinti kaa chitra ankit karte hai
 The remaining 21 texts of the New Testament are Shiksha-pradhan, namely 14 letters of Sant Pal, two letters of Santpeeter, three letters of the saint Yohan, the gospel writer, one letter by Saint Yakub and one by Saint Jude
 sant paal ke patr yaa to kisi sthanvishesh ke nivaasiyon ke liye likhe gaye hai yaa kisi vyaktivishesh ko 
 There is no doubt about the authenticity of the letters of the Hebrews, which are included in the Bible, but despite being influenced by the thoughts of Sant Pal, their author will be someone else

 Many texts have been written in the Greek language and a small fraction in Aramaic

 The creation of the Bible dates back to 1400 BC
 It is believed to date back to 100 AD

 The texts which have been included in the Bible are written in many genres, not in the same style - folklore, poetry and hymns, sermons and fables etc
 are found in many literary forms

 The translation of the Bible has been in operation for centuries

 In 2009, Jehovah's Witnesses published a Hindi translation, the New World Translation, the Christian Greek Scriptures, and this translation is also available on their website
 bible ishwar prerit bhi he or saadhaaran manushyon kii rachana bhi he; at: isaki vyakhya main is dohare kartrutv kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Being a masterpiece of man, the Bible should be studied like other cosmic literature; Therefore isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki bible ke vyaakhyaata ke liye bible main ullikhit deshon kii vistrut jaankaree ke atirikt bhashavigyaan, itihaas, bhugol, puraatatv, dharmon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan jaisi anek sahaayak vidhaayen atyant aavashyak hai

 Scientific interpretation of the Bible can only be meaningful according to church tradition
 bhugolic drushti se bible kaa prabhaav bahut hi vistrut he
 Maybe it is a contingency
 mulat: ek damit janata ke dharm ke rup main isiyat anek pareekshanon ke pashchaat apane vijiton kaa dharm bani
 The ancient religion of the Bible is spiritually combined with the Quran and Islam and is associated with a chosen elite
 musa athwa isa, abraham yaa suleman muslimon main shraddhey naam hai
 The Bible is different from this
 yah kai granthon kaa nichod he
 This is the entire story of the Jewish people and perhaps the most varied Jewish experiences among the ancient people
 yah aisi jati thi jo khoonkhaar kabeelon se ghiri thi or jo swayan bhi kam khoonkhaar na thi
 Sometimes they were demeaned, conquered and enslaved
 is jati ne kabhi apane shatruon ko vijit kiya tathaa unki shakti aajamaai, phir bhoomisaat kar daalaa 
 It is the aspiration and inspiration and triumph and defeat of one such public who is described in the Bible with amazing vivacity
 usne hamen apane abraham or musa jaise mahaan netaaon, daaud or suleman jaise mahaan raajaaon tathaa mahaan avtaron ke vishay main gyaan karaayaa he jinhone samay samay par utpann hokar apane drudh vachanon dwaara anuchit maarg par arudh janata ko tokaa
 It has been the same sequence till Sevanola
 unhone unki hinsaparayan vritti ko swayan bhoga liya, aalasy or krurta kii ninda kii jisaki ore janata swabhaavat: abhimukh thi
 The Bible also shows about bloodpipes like Abraham, fierce violent kings and uncivilized queens
 yah janata kii aitihaasik ghatnaon or tithiyon kii samhita he
 In the inevitable small boundaries of a book, despite its virtually ethnic history, it is full of surprising truths
 pracheen dharmaniyam kii samaapti ke saath usamen ek aakasmik parivartan hota dikhaai detaa he
 History remains the same but its nature changes
 yahudiyon kaa bhayankar ishwar hataa diya jaataa he or kalpana main bhartiya dhang kaa ek snehi ishwar ubhad aata he
 Perhaps the first blurred images of such a trend are found in some incarnations of the heart of ancient Dharmanium itself, especially in Isaiah etc
 kintu ishwar ke sambandh main yah ibranio kii koi anupatik kalpana nahin he
 His feeling was eye to eye
 lekin jab isa ne unase kaha ki ve unke daayen gaal par thappad jamaanevaale ke saamne apana bayen gaal bhi pher den, ve aise krantikari darshan or hinsa ke nipat asweekaar kii baaten na samaj sake
 Thus, he disqualified the author of this new religious belief and eventually gave it to him
 kintu us din galgotha naamak sthaan par cross se pravaahit raktabinduon kii dhara ne ek nae dharm ko janm diya
 The Christian people see him as a symbol for themselves and preach the words of Jesus
 is prakaar, buniyadi taur par dhairya or prem ne twara or ghrinaa par vijay praapt kii
 No one thought that those who indulged in the homogenously recited singing found in secret and furnished tendons or cottages inside Rome, which were previously only suitable for the sake of the deposits of the fierce Roman festivals, would one day only see the royal power of Rome We will not only shake you, but will build a better and more glorious Rome-like Sanatan Nagar in the coming days
 phir isai log cross rupi shastr se susajjit hokar tamaam rome main fail gaye
 Although here he was not a Roman corps but saints with tables and clergymen, who passed away in thousands laughing to death, he preached biblical messages among Europe's rambunctious and uncivilized people
 bible ke shabdon ne un asabhyon kaa aanshik rup se sabhy banaaya
 Thus the Church or Institute of Christianity continued to dominate Europe's mind for at least a thousand years, with its full coverage
 yahan tak ki saadhaaran se saadhaaran aachaar athwa vichaar-kalpana par bhi isiyat kii chhap rakhti padati thi
 But the same church, which originally developed to fight against tyranny and oppression, now itself became the biggest bearer of oppression and autocracy
 pun: bible janata ko sankatmukt karne ke liye aage ai
 This in itself is a contradiction
 jab carch apni aseem shakti ke kaaran maanya ho gaya tha or padariyon ne cross ko vismrit kar diya tathaa mahanth log anuchit laabh uthaane lage the janata bedaav hokar pun: ishwari vachanon ko foundne lagi
 Originally written in Hebrew and Arabshek, it was 400 AD Was translated into Latin by St
 Jerome C
 and this authentic translation was used by the Roman Catholic Church
 kintu latin sarvasaamaanya logon kii bhashaa na thi, duusare isai dharmaguru bhashaaon yaa foohad boliyon main hue bible ke anuwaadon se bahut chidhate the
 This was not only because the Christian leaders wanted to maintain their position of privilege, although there was an abundance of it, they were afraid that their words would not lose the power and intent of the divine words by being translated into the colloquial language
 keval ek chirparichit muhaavara poojya bhav or bhakthi ko uttejit karanevaala atyuttam madhyam nahin he athwa anivaary rup se gahan satyon kaa sarvopari sampreshak nahin he
 Somehow, due to the misconduct of the church, a new conflict started in religion and religious institution

 Although the actual renaissance came decades later, these scholars and worshipers of Christianity were its precursors

 "lollard" was the first to raise his voice in England
 yah ek sampradaay tha jo janata main isa messiah ke upadeshon kii shiksha detaa tha or carch tathaa math ke vichaar kaa virodh karata tha
 Their leader, Vikliffe was a man of amazing courage and erudition
 usne anubhav kiya ki vichaarparivartan ke liye logon ko isa ke upadeshvachanon kii jaankaree aavashyak he
 For this, translation of the Bible into the public language became necessary
 is prakaar us kaal kii naveen chetana vicliff kii aawaaj main dhvanit hui
 Wikliffe occurred at a time when English prose had little power to express the full opulence and beauty of the Bible
 iskaa apana anuwaad bahut hi ruksh he
 Perhaps he had no ear for English-speaking music
 ibrani padya kii kuch apni nijee visheshtaon ke kaaran uske mul sanskaran main ek aisi bhavyata bhi thi or prayog se kahin adhik mahatv hebrewwali bible ke shabdasaundarya kaa tha jo kuch pracheen anuwaadon main sahaj hi kho gaya tha
 Nouns have a special place in syntax, and the imperative of divisions today was not even there at that time, because it was a great real fantasy that the Jews had their own and their sensitiveness to words
 is prakaar kuch shabdon main hi samathrya or tivrata hoti thi kyonki ve shabd lagu na hokar beej rup main hote the
 Apart from this, the theme of ancient Dharmanium is widely accessible
 vishaywastu ke ruchikar hone or alp-samay-saadhy hone ke gunon ke kaaran isaki gaathaayen, varnan, natyagitiyaan bhavishyavaaniyan, sukhtiyaan, laghu kathaayen sabhi ne milakar ek savyav aakaar-prakaar dhaaran kar liya tha
 Finally, the New Testament contains the words of Jesus in the law
 at: unhen samajhane main thodi bhi chook athwa bhram ho jane par na keval uljhan hi bad jaati he balki sampurna aashay hi bhrasht ho jaataa he
 It is no wonder, therefore, that the churches did not consider the translations appropriate
 phir bhi wiliam tinden ne bible ke angreji anuwaad kaa pratham pramanik prayaas kiya
 He used the original Italian version which was prepared in Italy in the fifteenth century and also resorted to a Wikliffe translation made in the fourteenth century
 anuwaad ke liye usne saralatam angl shabdon ko chunaa or is prakaar jansadharan kii bhashaa se naikaty sthapit karte hue apana anuwaad prastut kiya 
 Tyndale also used Erasmus and the Zurich version of Luther and Zinggli
 phir bhi tindel kii sahajata kahin kahin atapate prayogon se sambhddha thi
 But it was only near Tyndale's Bible that Kaberdale was a great preacher
 vah tindel kii spashtataa ko nibaahane main safal hua he kintu usne use vaagmiyata se bhar diya he
 That is why he proves to be an extraordinary craftsman of prose
 kaverdell ke pashchaat san 1611 tak is disha main kai prayaas kiye gaye
 Seven years of tireless hard work produced the authentic version
 47 vidwaanon, vishpon ne lasalot andüju kii adhyakshata main, westminster ke do vishvavidhyalayon main, is kaary ko teen khandon main puraa kiya
 Scholars wisely left Tyndale's clarity and Coverdale's lyrical eloquence to a large extent

 Not only did it fill the Hebrew with its innate beauty and elemental power intact, but in proper terms, it acquired a "pictorial" and lyrical quality that was the result of excellent English talent
 yah janata kii boli main ghulmil gaya he
 Scholars say that his 93 ऽ words are in English
 uskaa shabd kabhi bhi praapt yaa siikhaa hua nahin he tathaa anuwaad main gruhit shabd bilkul hi nahin he
 It was also necessary to clarify the intention as there should be no scope for rigor in the book, which is considered to be the book of God
 yadhyapi style bolchaal kii hi honi aavashyak thi taaki log samaj saken, tathaapi ganvaarupan ke liye bilkul hi sthaan na tha
 Then, it was also necessary to have simple words, and as such occasion beauty and restraint were also required

 Hi Mera Dil is a Hindi language film made in 1968

 The competition is fictitious in that it is simply a ranking scheme overlaid on regular ODI matches
 har vanade match ke baad donon tiimon ko ek ganitiya sutara ke aadhaar par ank praapt shaamil kiya gaya
 Each team is divided by total points played to give their overall number of matches a rating, and all teams are ranked in a table in order of rating

 On 12 October 2016, Australia led the ICC ODI Championship as a high with a rating of 118, while Ireland, the lowest ranked team, has a rating of 42

 Ten ICC full members that play Test cricket are automatically listed in the main table

 This happens overnight, so teams can result in changing positions in the ranking table even if they are not playing
