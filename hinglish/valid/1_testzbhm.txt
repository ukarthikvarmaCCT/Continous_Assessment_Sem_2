is jhole ko ab shuddh vilaayak main rakh diya jaataa he
 This solvent is the only medium of the bud
 vaidyut apohan se shodhan adhik purna or shghri sampann kiya ja saktaa he
 Water-loving urns are extremely permanent and inert to small quantities of electrodynamics
 inkaa sthayitv unki madhyam main vileyata ke kaaran hota he
 The outer surface of these calculus is covered with molecules of medium
 is prakaar bahyatal kii mukt urja naganya rahati he
 This makes these particles unable to grow in size
 iske atirikt yah dekha gaya he ki jalpremi kalil madhyam kaa antartaleey tanaav kam kar dete hai
 Stability of the buds is also controlled by this effect
 jalasantrasi kalilon kaa sthayitv kalilkanon par sthit aavesh ke kaaran hota he
 The charge on the outer plane of the calculus is created by the ions absorbed by them
 kisi vidyudvishleshya ke milaane par kalilkanon ke tal par aavesh ksheen ho jaataa he or dhire-dhire aisi sthiti aa jaati he jab vidyudvishleshya kii nimnatam sandratha par kalilkanon kaa tal ekikaran kii shaktiyon kaa virodh kar paane main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Thus the lowest concentration of electrodynamics, which is capable of depositing a certain amount of a particle, is called the precipitation value of the particle
 saadhaarant: vidyudvishleshya ke us aayan kii sanyojaktaa, jo kalilkaran ke aavesh ke vipareet ho, jitani hi adhik hoti he, vidyudvishleshya kii avakshepan shakti bhi utani hi adhik prabal hoti he
 Hydrographic tubes are added to them to keep them safe from hydrodynamics
 is vidhi ko sangrakshan vidhi kehete hai
 Swarnakalil can be degraded with a small amount of gelatin, but a high amount of this protein gives stability to this bud
 jigmondi ke anusaar kisi kalil sangrakshak kaa swarnmaan kalil sangrakshak ke milligraamon kii vah sankhya he jisaki upasthiti main swarna ke 10 ghan centimetre pramanik kalil ko sodium chloride ke aise 1ghan sein
me
 vilyan dwaara, jiskaa sandran 10 pratishat ho, avakshipt kiya ja sake
 The conservation of Kalil is of special importance and has been practiced since ancient times
 yah pehle hi kaha ja chukaa he ki kalil kanon par aavesh rahata he
 Simple absorption experiments can be done to find the type of charge on the cell
 dhanatmak kalil silica jelly dwaara or rinatmak kalil aluminium hydraksaide dwaara avashoshit kar liye jate hai
 Charge is important for the stability of the hydrologist Kalil
 aavesh kaa prakaar padaarth ke bhautik swabhaav par or kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karanevaale vidyudvishleshya par nirbhar rahata he
 For example, if the silver iodide sol is charged, the type of charge on it can be both positive or negative
 yadi kalil main rajat nitrate kaa sookshm aadhiky hua to saul dhanatmak hoga
 Conversely, if excess of potassium iodide occurs, the sol will become negative
 yah dekha gaya he ki dhanatmak rajat aayan ke abhimaanya adhishoshan ke kaaran rajat iodide kalil kaa aavesh dhanatmak or iodide ke rinatmak aayan ke adhishoshan ke kaaran is kalil kaa aavesh rinatmak ho jaataa he
 The amount and potential of charge on the ground floor are measured by money-electrocution
 saul ko you nalee main bharaa jaataa he jisamen do platinum ke vidyudagr rahete hai
 Now Daish Vidyuthara flows in Saul
 yadi kan dhanagar kii ore badhate hai to unpar rinatmak vidyut aavesh rahata he
 This type of motion of particles in the electric field is called money-power-transmission
 yah gati upyukt prakaashiya vidhiyon dwaara suvidhapurvak maapi ja sakati he
 The voltage can be calculated by measuring the velocity
 is vibhav ko saadhaarant: vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav kaha jaataa he
 This electromagnetic potential is also seen when the electromagnetic solution is sent through a collimated diluent
 do anya sambandhit kriyaaon par bhi anusandhan kiye gaye hai
 These are current potential and precipitation potential
 vaidyuthik gatyaatmak vibhav narnst vidyut rasinic vibhav se bhinn he
 It is now proved that the electrochemical chemical potential is the voltage that lies between the distributed art and the main volume of the delivery medium
 vaidyuthik-gatyaatmak vibhav vah vibhav he jo us vitarit kala se sanlagn dwik tal ke sthir bhaag main vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The real nature of the bicameral attached to distributed art is still a matter of imagination
 phir bhi yah gyaat kar liya gaya he ki vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav upasthit yanon se vishesh prabhavit hota he
 There is ample evidence that the laws of gas fit well with the solutions
 kisi kalil kii rasakarshan daab kii gananaa neeche likhe sameekaran dwaara kii ja sakati he: Where: ab chunki rasakarshan daab kan ke aakaar kaa pratilomanupati hota he isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki kalil kii rasakarshan daab kam honi chahie or vitaran kii maatra ke aadhiky ke saath inaki maatra bhi badhani chahie
 In this way, generally the impulse pressure of the rings is low and when the pressure is high, it is mainly due to impurities
 rasakarshan daab kaa maapan ardhapargamya jhilli kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he
 The uneven distribution of electrosynthesis leads to complexity in some buds due to an action called dononsantulation
 is tanupat santulan kii kriya kaa adhyayan congou red naamak rang, sabun tathaa anya kai kalileey vidyudvishleshyon par kiya gaya he
 In these conditions the collicular substance behaves like an electrodynamic
 jab kisi aayan kaa aakaar kalilkanon ke aakaar ke samaan hota he jab tanupat ke donon ore vibhav kaa srijan hota he, jise tanupat vibhav kehete hai
 In many protein cells, dilution-potential always arises and charge on living cells is due to this equilibrium balance
 ati sookshmdarshi dwaara dekhne se kalilkanon kaa aakaar yaa rup nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Nevertheless the number of calculus can be counted; The average volume of a particle can then be determined by the value of the absolute volume of the distributed matter
 kintu jab saul nirmaan kiya jaataa he tab usamen kai aakaar ke kan upasthit rahete hai
 The form of the calculus can be spherical, lanceolate, elliptical or flaky
 kalilkanon kaa rup gyaat karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan viksit kii gai hai jo prakaashiya gunon par aadhaarit hai
 These plumes are characterized by having an impact on the viscosity of the delivery medium
 shyanta adhiktar bad jaati he or vitarit padaarth kii maatra kii vruddhi ke saath shghrita se badhati jaati he
 Viscosity increases so much when a particular concentration is reached that Kalil takes the form of jelly
 saul ke avakshepan se bhi jelly praapt kii ja sakati he
 The use of jelly is limited and the semipermeable gels that are made by cooling the gelatine, agar agar, starch, etc
 are called jelly
 adhikansh jalpremi kalil sheetaleekaran par yaa garm karne par jelly banaate hai
 Many inorganic hydrological plants can also be obtained as jelly under special conditions
 is prakaar se kai jaleey hydraxidon, aviley faspheton, molibdeton kii jeliyaan prayogshaala main banaai jaati hai
 The jelly generally exhibits the properties of liquid release
 adhik samay tak rakhane par jelly sikudti tathaa chatak jaati he or jelly main bandhaa hua jal baahar nikal aata he
 Jails can be divided into two classes: elastic and rigid
 pratyasth jeliyaan saadhaarant: gelatin, aighar aadi prakritik kalilon se banati hai, kintu adhikansh acarbonic jeliyaan, jinamein silisik amla bhi rahata he, drudh vyavhaar dikhaati hai
 Some jails have a strange nature
 ve hilaane par, andolit karne par yaa karnathit tarangon ke prabhaav se pun: saul main parivartit ho jaati hai
 But if they are kept stable then they become jelly again
 yah kriya kai baar duharai ja sakati he
 This action is called tactile sense
 jalpremi kalilon main proteinon ke saulon par vishesh khojein hui hai
 The reason for this is their importance in physical chemistry
 proteinon ke jo saul prakritik avasthaa main paae jate hai ve saadhaarant: rinatmak aveshwale hote hai
 Most solutes achieve positive charge when made acidic
 is prakaar ek vishesh pi ech par protein ke saul par koi bhi aavesh nahin hoga
 This is called isocele point
 isi se protein kii pahchaan haati he
 The chemical properties are ancient amphoteric because it has more bona fides
 is gun ke kaaran protein bafar kaa kaam detaa he
 This quality has special significance in the life of animals
 proteinon main jalasantrasi kalilon ko sthayitv pradaan karne kaa samarthy rahata he or inaki swarnsankhya kii sahaayta se kai rogon ke nidaan main sahaayta milti he
 It is not possible to calculate all the uses of the plants
 adhikansh jaivik taral padaarth, jaise rakt aadi, swabhaav ke hote hai
 As calcium-soap, metals such as calcium, gold, iron, gold, manganese, silver, etc
, or their insoluble compounds, are used in medicine in the form of kalil
 aahaar vigyaan main kalileey padaarthon par vichaar karnaa padataa he
 The humic and clayey soil properties have a special effect on soil fertility and its physical properties
 reshe carbonic kalil hai or kapadaa udyog bhi kalileey udyog hi he
 The color and printing used in the manufacture of chintz is done only because of the color properties
 kuch abhikaarakon main celulosiya padaarth ke kalileey gunon par kritrim resham kaa nirmaan aadhaarit he
 Soaps and detergents are the waste materials and many substances, such as lubricants, plastics, rubber, lubricants, oily dyes, etc
, are found to have scleenic properties
 kaanch, mrittika tathaa cement udyog kalileey vigyaan se vishesh rup se sambhddha hai
 Most of our diets, such as proteins, carbohydrate fats in the form of starch, etc
 are also lax in properties
 kalil rasayan kii takanic hamaare anek bhojya padaarth banane main aavashyak hoti he jaise pavaroti, makkhan, jelly, jam, peya, icecream aadi

 Binaka Geetmala was the first countdown program of Indian film music on radio
 The 1950s and 1960s were the decades of film, film music and radio
 Apart from film and radio, there was no other special means of entertainment in those days
 a program based on popular film songs was broadcast from Radio Ceylon in those days - Binaka Geetmala
 The most popular program related to film songs was at that time
 Every Wednesday from 8 am to 9 pm people used to stick to the radio to listen to the Binaka Geetamala
 The confluence of melodious melodies and melodious vocals kept the audience feeling full for an hour
 binaaka gitamala kaa pehla kaarykram san 1952 ke antim saptaah main prasaarit hua tha
 Films like Mahal, Naagin, Udan Khatola, which had only melodious music in their souls, had its era
 Announcer Amin Sayani's special style with melodious songs captivated the audience and from its very first telecast Binaka Geetmala became the most popular program of radio
 Till 1952-53, only 7 songs were broadcast, and the songs were not given popularity status in this program
 san 1954 se binaaka gitamala count down kaarykram ban gaya or gaanon ko reating diya jane laga| us san ke pehle kaarykram main talat mahmud kaa gaaya geet ‘jaayen to jaayen kahan




’ sheersh geet tha
 Popularity was the mainstay of the ratings of songs
 The sales records of the record of the songs were collected to determine the popularity and audience votes were also taken
 But later on it came to know that for many songs, listeners send many ballots with fake names, the method of whiting was abolished
 binaaka gitamala ke naam ko do baar badla gaya, pehle sibaka gitamala or baad main kolgate gitamala ke rup main| baad main sibaka gitamala kaa prasaaran radio vividh bharti se bhi kiya jane laga par vividh bharti main iskaa naam sibaka sangitamala hua karata tha
 Any song would be retired after playing 25 times, the ratings were fixed on an annual basis by adding the number of footsteps and the Binaka Geetmala Sartaj song was played on the last Wednesday of December
 is kaarykram ke shuru hone ke varsh 39 baad televijan par filmi geeton ke count down kaarykram superhit muqabla shuru ho jane ke kaaran iskaa logon main prabhaav kam hone laga or kaarykram ke 42wein varsh main is kaarykram ko band kar diya gaya| Vividh Bharati hind-australian plate ek mukhya bhugolic plate he jisapar australia kaa mahadweep, bhartiya upmahadweep kaa adhikansh hissaa or ird-gird kaa bada samudri kshetra sthit he

 Fibrous food sources are often divided based on their solubility
 ye reshe ghulansheel or aghulansheel hote hai
 Both these elements are found in the fibers from plants
 subjiyan, gehu or adhiktar anaajon main ghulansheel reshe kii apeksha aghulansheel resha hota he
 Both types of fibers work in their own way to contribute to health
 jahaan ghulansheel reshe se sampurna swasthy par sakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he, vahiin aghulansheel reshe se motopa sambandhi samasya bhi bad sakati he
 Insoluble fiber helps digestion and reduces constipation

 The set of gross works related to dictionary formation is called koshakarma or lexicography
 vishyon kii drushti se shabdkoshon ke varg yaa vibhaag bananaa kathin he
 Different Kokhars used to create such subjects according to their understanding
 unka na to koi nishchit kram hota tha or na ho hi saktaa tha
 So people often had to memorize the entire dictionary
 isi kaaran paashchaatya deshon main shabdkosh aksharkram se banane lage
 There was no need to rote such a dictionary and he could use it as and when required
 aajkal praaia: sabhi deshon or sabhi bhashaaon main kosh ke kshetra me isi kram ko prayog hone laga he : jo jigyaasu kii drushti se sabase adhik subhite kaa hota hai
 That's why alphabet is often used in all types of thesaurus
 yon to kosh ke anek prakaar hote hai, par arth ke vichaar se ve do bhaagon main baante ja sakate hai
 One is those in which meanings and interpretations of the words of a language are in the same language and other in which the meanings of the words of one language are given in another language or languages
 vishay ke vichaar se kosh anek prakaar ke ho sakate hai, jaise-ganit kosh, vidhik kosh, vaidyak kosh, sahitya kosh aadi
 Such dictionaries are often counted in terms such as agricultural terminology, philosophical terminology, geographical terminology etc
 inke sivaa kuch vishisht kaviyon, boliyon aadi ke bhi alag alag kosh hote hai, jaise-tulsi kosh, sur kosh, avadhi kosh, brajabhasha kosh aadi
 The main symbols, topics or words that contain thesaurus or tables in important texts of a particular subject are called successive metaphorical index, subject index or concordance
 koshrachana ek kala he
 Knowledge of this art can be obtained by studying the dictionaries of the most advanced languages of the present era with a subtle view
 achche or pramanik koshon kaa sampadan tab tak keval vidwata ke bal par nahin ho saktaa, jab tak koshrachana kii kala kaa bhi puraa puraa gyaan na ho or is kala kaa gyaan koshon ke jivanavyapee adhyayan se hi ho saktaa he
 All types of thesaurus are made only for the fulfillment of a particular purpose and the need of a particular area
 at: koshrachana main mukhyat: isi uddeshy yaa aavashyaktaa kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa hai
 Secondly, one has to keep in mind that his entire body is balanced in all respects; It is not that an organ grows more than it needs or justification, and someone seems to be weak or inferior in comparison
 shabdon kaa vivechan bhi or us vivechan ke angon kaa kram bhi sadaa ek sa rahanaa chahie
 Words also have castes or classes, so all the words of a caste or class should have the same interpretation
 yadi pramanik granthon athwa lekhakon ke udhaaharan liye jaae, to unka utana hi ansh lenaa chahie, jitne main aashay spasht ho sake or jigyaasu kaa samaadhaan ho jaae
 Good dictionaries also contain terminology for all types of fields and subjects
 isaliye sampadak kaa adhik se adhik vishyon kaa saamaanya gyaan yaa bodh hona chahie
 When needed, it is necessary to seek help from a good and authentic book of an unknown or new subject or even from a good writer
 koshrachana ke kaary main drushti bahut vyapak rakhana chahie or vritti madhukaari honi chahie
 The vision should be so sharp and subtle that it can easily make sense of Neer Ksheer and by finding old errors, faults, mistakes, etc
, it can be easily corrected and corrected
 koshkar main pakshpaat yaa rogadwesh naam ko bhi nahin rahanaa chahie
 Its sole purpose should be to serve language and literature
 koshon main pradhanta arthon or vivechanon kii hi hoti he, at: unamem kahin vyapti yaa ativyapti nahin rahani chahie
 All things should be brief, nappy and moderate as much as possible
 kosh main adhik se adhik or thos jaankaree kam se kam shabdon main prastut karke hi jaani chahie
 There is no place in the dictionary for unnecessary or recruitment matters
 shabdon ke kuch rup to maanak hote hai or bahut se rup sthanik yaa prantiy hote hai
 The spatial or provincial words of which the standard forms are received should be interpreted within the same standard words and their standard or provincial forms should be mere reference to their standard forms
 isse bahut bada laabh yah hota he ki anya bhashaa-bhashiyon ko sahaj main shabdon ke maanak rup kaa pataa chal jaataa he or bhashaa kaa maanak rup sthir hone main sahaayta milti he-aparichiton ke dwaara bhashaa kaa rup sahasaa bigadane nahin paata
 The same thing should be done with regard to Sanskrit words which have many synonyms
 jaise camel, nadi, parvat, samudr aadi
 While giving their synonyms in front of words, it should also be kept in mind that only those synonyms should be given the exact meaning or measure of the original word
 jin paryaayon ke kaaran kuch bhi bhram utpann ho saktaa ho, un paryaayon kaa aise prasangon main parityag karnaa hi shreyaskar hoga
 Recently, Webster's New World Dictionary has set a new model in front of lexicographers, which is very useful and useful for dictionaries, because they are very useful and useful
 usamen anek shabdon ke antargat unase milte julate paryaayon ke sookshm antar bhi dikhalaae gaye hai, yatha - feare ke antargat dred, friete, elarm, disme, teror or painic ke sookshm antar bhi batala die gaye hai
 It has been done in such a way that the work of the lexicon is not finished by conveying the meaning of the words, but even beyond this, its job is to tell people the correct use of the words
 hamaare yahan aise saikadon hajaaron shabd milenge, jinke parsparik sookshm antar batalaaye ja sakate hai or is prakaar jigyaasuon ko shabdon par nae dhang se vichaar karne kaa abhyaas karaayaa ja saktaa he
 There is another new and useful practice in recent good and big English dictionaries, which can be particularly useful for Indian language dictionaries
 praaia: sabhi bhashaaon main bahut se aise yogic shabd hote hai jo upsarg lagaakar bana liye jate hai
 Junior to Junior, Causal to Indeterminate, Expected to Unexpected, Necessary to Unnecessary, Minister to Deputy Minister, Committee to Subcommittee, Adherence to Compliance, Excursion from Cruise, Reaction to Karma, Legislation from Legislation etc
 upsargon ke yoga se bananevaale aise shabdon kii sankhya bahut adhik hoti he
 Such words are divided into two classes or can be divided
 ek to aise shabd jinke shabd purv pad tathaa uttar pad mil kar bhi kisi nae yaa vishisht arth se yukt nahin hote or isi liye saadhaaran shabdon ke antargat rahete hai
 Such words and their meanings greatly increase the level of the dictionary
 is prakaar ke vyarth vistaar se bachane ke liye webster ke nae koshon main yah nai paddati apanaai gai he ki unhen swatantra shabd nahin maanate or isi liye unke arth bhi nahin liye gaye hai
 At the end of the page, a list of such words is given below a line, as-un-destined, un-disturbed, un-free, un-hurt, un-invoked etc
 haan, inke vipareet duusare varg ke kuch aise shabd avashya hote hai jinamein upsargon ke yoga se kuch nae arth nikalate hai
 As in the adjective form, the form of Achcha is hairless, but in noun form it is also a name for the planet Ketu
 anagaar kaa arth bina ghar-barwaala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah sanyasi kaa bhi vaachak he
 Therefore it is necessary to take such words
 jin shabdon ke arth purvpad or utaarpad ke yoga se swat: nasht ho jate hon, unhen koshon main arthsahit lenaa vyarth hi samajha jane laga he
 Therefore, it would be sufficient to just give a list of such words in the page
 haan, jin yogic shabdon main donon padon ke yoga se koi nayaa or vishesh arth nikalataa ho, unhen yathasthaan arthsahit lenaa to aavashyak he hi
 The method of our old Sanskrit dictionary has been that the words formed by the sum of ati, prati, etc
 are given together under the same title under their former term
 hindi ke kuch koshon ne bhi is pratha kaa anukaran kiya he
 Although this method is rational from the point of view of Sanskrit grammar, even in Sanskrit dictionaries, it does not appear to be fully followed
 isamen sthaan kii kuch bachat avashya hoti he, par asaadhaaran pathakon ke liye shabd dhoondhna bahut kathin ho jaataa he
 Sometimes it is difficult to find words from this method even for people who are very familiar with its rules and principles
 prayek bhashaa main kuch shabd aise hote hai jo alag alag arthon ke vichaar se avyay, kriyavisheshan, visheshan, pratyay sangya aadi bhi hote hai or alag alag mulon se bhi vyutpann hote hen, yatha hindi ko aan shabd sangya bhi he, visheshan bhi or pratyay bhi
 In its noun form, it is derived from a few different origins in many of its meanings
 aise shabd aadhunik or shreshth angareji koshon main alag or swatantra shabd maane jate hai or unke alag alag sheershak rakhkar unka vivechan kiya jaataa he, yatha-angareji main waayiz visheshan bhi he, sangya bhi or pratyay bhi or teenon roopon main uske sheershak alag alag rakhe gaye hai
 If they are also followed in the lexicons of Indian languages, it will be very good in many respects

 GSM is the most popular standard for mobile phones in the world

 GSM differs from its predecessors in that it has digital signal and communication channels and is therefore considered a second generation mobile phone system
 isse yah bhi taatpary nikalataa he ki is pranali main data sanchaar kaa nirmaan aasaan he
 The ubiquity of the GSM standard is beneficial for both consumers and network operators
 GSM ne ek kam laagat vaale vaais kol ke vikalp kaa laghu sandesh seva pravartan kiya he, jo ab anya mobile maanakon par bhi samarthit he
 Another advantage is that this standard includes a worldwide emergency telephone number, 112

 GSM is a cellular network, which means mobile phones connect to it by searching for their nearest cell
 GSM network main cell ke paanch alag-alag aakaar he- sthool, sookshm, pico, femato or ambrella cell
 prayek cell kaa vistaar-kshetra karyanvayan parivesh ke anusaar bhinn hota he
 Macro cells can be considered cells where the base station antenna is installed on a pillar or building whose height is higher than the average roof
 Micro cells are those whose antenna height is less than the average ceiling height; They are commonly used in urban areas
 pico cell aise chote cell hai jinka vistaar-vyas kuch darjan meter hi hota he; inkaa upyog mukhya rup se bhawan ke andar kiya jaataa he
 Femto cells are cells that are envisaged for use in residential or small business environments and connected to a service provider's network through a broadband Internet connection
 ambrella cell kaa upyog, chote cell ke chaaya-kshetron ko dhakne or un selon ke bich kii khaali jagah ko bharne ke liye hota he
 The horizontal half-diameter of the cell varies from hundreds of meters to several kilometers depending on the height of the antenna, antenna gain and transmission environment
 vyaavhaarik taur par GSM vinirdesh dwaara samarthit sabase adhik duuri he 35 kilometre ek vistrut cell kii avadharana ke kai karyanvayan hai, jahaan cell kaa arddh vyas antina pranali, bhu-bhaag ke prakaar or agrim samay ke aadhaar par duguna yaa usase bhi zyaada ho saktaa he
 The coverage inside the building is also supported by GSM and can be achieved by using an in-door picocell base station or through an inverter repeater with an internal antenna supplied by an energy breaker, so that the radio signal from the external antenna is distributed separately inside the building
 To be delivered to the system
 These are usually expanded when there is a need for excessive call capacity indoors; For example at large shops or airports
 However, this is not a pre-requisite, as internal coverage is provided by the entry of radio signals from a nearby cell within the building
 jiesem main prayukt adhimishran gausian nunatam-antaran sangyojan he, jo ek prakaar kaa satat-charan fricvency antaran sangyojan he
 In GMSK, the signal to be modulated on the carrier is sweetened with Gaussian low-pass filters prior to supply on the frequency modulator, greatly reducing the risk of interference from neighboring vessels
 kuch shravy upkaran radio fricvency hastkshep ke prati samvedansheel hote hai, jise in shravy upkarnon ke atirikt parirakshan yaa bai-paas sandharitra ke prayog se kaafii kam kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the huge cost involved in doing this makes it difficult for any designer to justify it

 When these audio devices live in the vicinity of GSM handsets, the radio signals are so strong that solid amplifiers act as a detector in the audio range
 clik kii dhwani hi shakti-visphot kii dyotak he, jo TDMA signal kii samvahak he

 GSM networks operate in many different frequency extension ranges
 Most 2G GSM networks operate on the 900 mhz or 1800 mhz band
 kuch amareeki desh 850 mhz or 1900 mhz kaa prayog karte hai, kyonki 900 or 1800 mhz fricvency band pehle hi abantit kiye gaye the
 Most of the 3G GSM networks in Europe operate in the 2100 mhz frequency band
 kuch deshon main durlabh 400 or 450 mhz fricvency band nirdisht kiye gaye hai, jahaan in fricvensiyon kaa upyog pehali peedi kii pranaaliyon ke liye ho rahaa tha
 The GSM-900 uses 890–915 mhz to transmit base station information from the mobile station and 935–960 mhz for other directions, providing 125 RF channels at intervals of 200 khz
 45 mhz kaa duplex antaraal prayukt hota he
 In some countries the GSM-900 band has been expanded to cover a greater frequency zone
 yah mul GSM-900 band main 50 channel jodate hue 'vistrut GSM', E-GSM, 880–915 mhz tathaa 925–960 mhz kaa upyog karata he
 Time division multiplexing is used to allow eight full-rate or sixteen half-rate speech channels per radio frequency channel
 TDMA frem main aath radio samyavadhi samahit hai
 Half-rate channels use alternate frames in the same timeframe
 sabhi 8 channelon ke liye channel data dar 270
833 kbit / s or frem avadhi 4,615 ms hai
 The transmission power of this handset is a maximum of 2 watts in GSM850 / 900 and 1 watt in GSM1800 / 1900
 GSM ne 5
6 tathaa 13 kbit / s ke bich dhwani ko sankuchit karne ke liye kai prakaar ke dhwani kodak kaa istemaal kiya he
 Originally two codecs, namely half-rate and full-rate, have been named based on the type of data channel allocated to them
 inamen ek aisi pranali kaa prayog hua he, jo rekhiy purvakathaneey koding par aadhaarit hoti he
 In addition to being effective towards bitrates, these codecs have made it much easier to identify the more important parts of the sound, making it easier for the air interface layer to preserve and prioritize these signals
 GSM ko 1997 main purna dar channel kaa upyog karne vaale vardhit purna dar kodak, ek 12
2 kbit / s kodak, main viksit kiya gaya
 Finally, with the development of UMTS the EFR was revamped as a variable-rate codec, called amr-narrowband, which is high-quality and robust to interference when used on full-rate channels, as well as, when It is used on a half-rate channel in good radio conditions, so it is less robust but of relatively high quality
 GSM ke peeche kaa network jo graahak ko dikhataa he, vah vishaal or jatil he, taaki aavashyak sabhi sevaayen pradaan kii ja saken
 yah vibhinn virgon main vibhajit he or inaki vyakhya alag lekhon main kii gai he
 One of the key features of GSM is the Subscriber Identity Module, commonly known as a SIM card
 SIM ek alag kiya ja sakane vaala smart card he, jisamen upyogkarta kii sadsyta-jaankaree or phone book hota he
 This allows the user to store their information even after changing the handset
 vaikalpik rup se, upyogkarta oparator badalane ke liye bina apana handset badale, keval SIM badal kar aisa kar saktaa he
 Some operators interrupt this action by allowing a single SIM in a phone or only by a SIM given by them; This practice is called SIM locking and in some countries it is illegal
 australia, uttari america or europe main kai oparator un mobile ko lock kar dete hai, jinhen ve bechate hai
 This is done because mobile phone prices are generally discounted at the time of subscription and operators want to avoid any concession on their competitors' mobiles
 ek graahak aam taur par kuch shulk dekar is baadha ko dur karne ke liye pradaata se sampark kar saktaa he, yaa phir vah nijee sevaaon ke zariye block ko khol saktaa he, yaa internet par uplabdh tamaam software or web-site kaa upyog karke bhi vah apane handset kaa block khol saktaa he
 Although most web-sites ask for some fee in lieu of block removal, some do so for free
 yah loking handset par lagu hota he, jo uske antarrashtriya mobile upkaran pahchaan sankhya se janaa jaataa he, naa ki khate par In some countries like Bangladesh, Belgium, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Pakistan, all phones are sold without lock
 tathaapi, belgium main operataron dwaara phone kii qeemat par kisi prakaar kii sabsidi dena gair-kanoonee he
 This was also the case in Finland until 1 April 2006, after which it became legal to sell subsidized handsets and accounts, although operators have to open the phone after a certain amount of time without charge
 GSM ko madhyam str kii suraksha ke saath dizine kiya gaya tha
 The system was designed to ensure the user's identity using a pre-shared key and challenge-response
 upyogkarta or base stesan ke bich ke samvaad ko kutabaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 The development of UMTS promotes an alternative USIM, which uses a longer identification key to provide greater security, as well as authenticate the user and network - while GSM only authenticates the user in front of the network
 The security model therefore offers privacy and authentication, but with limited authorization capabilities and without disclaimers
 GSM uses several cryptographic algorithms for security
 A5 / 1 or A5 / 2 stream bijlekh kaa prayog hawa ke upar aawaaj kii gopneeyata sunishchit karne ke liye hota he
 A5 / 1 was developed earlier and is a strong cypher used in Europe and America; A5 / 2 is a bit weak and is used in other countries

 ye nimnlikhit hai :- Marketing is a continuous process under which marketing mix is planned and implemented
 yah prakriya vyaktiyon or sanghathanon ke bich utpaadon, sevaaon yaa vichaaron ke vinimay hetu kii jaati he
 Marketing is seen as a creative industry, including advertising, distribution and sales
 It is also related to forethought of customers' future needs and aspirations, often explored through market research
 multah, vipanan kisi sanghathan ko banane yaa nirdeshit karne karne kii prakriya he, taaki logon ko safaltaapurvak vah utpaada yaa seva bechi ja sake jisaki na keval unhen zarurat he balki ve use kharidne ke icchhuk bhi hai
 Therefore, good marketing should be able to create an "offer" or set of benefits for the consumers, so that the customer is paid the value of his money through products or services
 iske visheshgy kshetron main shaamil hai : introduction ek bazaar kendrit yaa upabhokta kendrit sanghathan pehle yah tay karata he kii uskaa sambhavit graahak chahta kya he or tab utpaada yaa seva kii rachana kii jaati he
 Marketing principles and practices are considered justified when a customer uses a product or service when in need, or gains an perceived advantage
 vipanan ke do pramukh ghatak hai- nae graahakon ko shaamil karnaa tathaa maujuuda graahakon ko banaae evam unke saath sambandhon kaa vistaar karnaa 
 ek baar jab vikreta aane vaale kharidaar ko apana graahak bana letaa he to aadhaar prabandhan shuru ho jaataa he
 The process that begins under Aadhaar management involves the seller developing a relationship with its customer, nurturing the relationship, increasing the benefits offered and continuously improving its product / service so that its business is protected from competitors are
 vipanan yojana kii safalataa ke liye 4 Ps kaa mishran upabhoktaaon yaa lakshith bazaar kii maangon va zaruuraton main pratibimbit hona chahie
 ek bazaar khand ko vah kharidne ke liye raji karnaa jisaki unhen zarurat nahin, bahut hi kharchila kaam he or shaayad hi kabhi safal hota he
 Marketers rely on information from both formal and informal marketing research and decide what the customer wants and how much they are willing to pay for it
 vipanak aashaa karte hai kii is prakriya se unhen ek satat pratiyogi laabh hasil hoga
 vipanan prabandhan is prakriya hetu vyaavhaarik anuprayog he
 The proposal is also an important part of the 4 Ps principle
 america vipanan sangh ke anusaar, "vipanan ek sanghathanaatmak kaary or prakriyaaon kaa ek samooh he jisase graahak banaaye jate hai, unase sampreshan kiya jaataa he or unhen upyogita pradaan kii jaati he tathaa upabhokta se rishte banaaye jate hai taaki sanghathan evam uske hitdharakon ko laabh mili
 Methods of marketing have been reported in many social sciences, especially in psychology, sociology and economics
 The influence of anthropology is also small but increasing
 bazaar anusandhan in gatividhiyon ko majbooti detaa he
 Marketing through advertising also connects to many creative arts
 vipanan ek vistrut evam kai prakashnon se bade str par paraspar sambaddh vishay he
 It is notorious for recreating itself and its terminology in a new way according to time and culture
 "vipanan" ek jaankaree dene vaala vyavsaayik kaary he jo lakshya kiye ja rahe bazaar ko company va uske utpaadon ke pratispardhaatmak laabh evam keemat ke bare suchit va shikshit karata he
 Price is the price a customer pays to own or use a product
 "pratispardhaatmak laabh " is baat ko darshata he kii company yaa uske utpaada donon apane pratidwandi se behatar aisa kuch kar rahe hai jisase upabhokta ko phayda pahunche
 The center of marketing is on delivering company and product related information to certain customers
 vipanan kaary main kai nirnay kiye jate hai kii koun si soochna deni he, kitni soochna deni he, kisko deni he, kaise deni he or kahaan deni he
 Once decisions are made, there are several methods and procedures that can be implemented in support of selected strategies
 vipanan kya he? main kris newton kehete hai vipanan ko aksar galatfahami main vigyaapan yaa bikri samaj liya jaataa he
 Marketing is defined as all the strategies and decisions that are decided in the following twelve areas: vipanan kaa dhyey he company or uske utpaadon ke liye lakshith bazaaron main praathamikta kaa nirmaan karnaa tathaa use banaaye rakhana
 kisi bhi kaarobaar kaa abhipraay hota he apane graahakon ke saath paraspar laabhakaari evam sthaayee sambandhon kaa nirmaan karnaa
 haalanki vyapaar ke sabhi kshetra isi dhyey kii prapti ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai, kintu vipanan par sabase adhik isaki jimmedaari hoti he
 If its definition is seen in a larger scope, the marketing work is done in coordination with three subjects: "product marketing", "corporate marketing" and, "marketing communication"
 ranneetik vipanan : yah nirdhaarit karne kaa prayaas kii ek sanghathan bazaar main apane pratidwandiyon se kaise muqabla kare

 Operational marketing: is to attract and retain customers and be more and more useful to them
 saath hi tatpar sevaaon dwaara graahak ko santusht karnaa or uski apekshaaon par khara utarana he
 Operational marketing involves the determination of Porter's five forces 1960 ke dashak ke armbh main, profesar nil borden ne harvard bijness skool main company ke aise kaaryon kii pahchaan kii jo utpaada yaa sevaayen kharidne ke graahak ke faisle ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Bourdain suggested that all those steps the company takes are a "marketing mix"
 professor i

 In common parlance, "marketing" is the promotion of the product, especially advertising and branding, but in commercial use it means a wide range of marketing means customer-centricity
 utpaadon kaa vikaas graahakon ke ek samooh yaa kuch maamalon main kuch khaas graahakon kii aavashyaktaaon kii poorti hetu kiya jaataa he

 Jerome mccarthy divided marketing into groups of four general activities
 His typology gained so much recognition worldwide that his "four P's" became part of the language
 ye chaar Ps hai: These four elements are known as the marketing mix, which a vendor uses to create a marketing plan
 kam keemat ke upabhokta utpaada ke vipanan main chaar p kaa model sabase adhik kaam aata he
 This model has to be adjusted in the case of industrial products, services, high value consumer products
 seva vipanan bejod kism kii sevaaon ke liye hona chahie
 audyogic yaa B2B vipanan, un dirghakaalin anubandhon ke liye hona chahie jo aapurti shrinkhalaa ke maamalon main vishisht hon
 sambandhon kaa vipanan main vipanan ko dirghakaalin sambandhon ke pariprekshya main dekha jaataa he bajaay vyaktigat vyavhaar ke
 Against this, Morgan suggested in Riding the Waves of Change, that one of the biggest drawbacks of the 4 Ps approach is that "it inadvertently emphasizes inward, while the essence of marketing must be outward"
 Nevertheless, 4 Ps is helpful as a memorable and workable guide and framework for the major categories of marketing work under which they can be used
 pehle se maujuud chaar Ps ke alaava sevaaon ke vipanan main teen atirikt sheershak jode gaye hai jinhen vistrut vipanan mishran kaha jaataa he
 These are: brands ek naam, shabd, dizine, pratik yaa koi anya visheshta he jo kisi utpaada yaa seva ko pratispardhi ke prastaav se alag karata he
 a brand represents the consumer's experience towards an organization, product, or service
 brands ko ek pahachaane jane yogya satta ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ek vishisht mulya kaa vaada karti hai
 Co-branding involves marketing activities involving two or more products
 mulya nirdhaaran se aashay us paise se he jo ek utpaada ke badale diya jaataa he
 This value is determined by the utility of the item, how much money and / or sacrifice the customer is willing to pay in return
 vipanan sanchaar ranneeti ke hisaab se vibhinn shreniyon ke liye vipanan sandesh taiyaar karata he or unhen tay lakshya kii ore preshit karata he
 There are separate stages of converting strangers into customers that control the communication medium used
 kisi vyakti yaa sambhavit graahakon ke samooh ko aprope karne vaale cells main dwaara maukhik prastuti: Short-term incentives to encourage product purchases iskaa ek udhaaharan he coupon yaa ek bikri
 logon ko kharidne ke liye protsaahan diya jaataa he, par isse graahak vishwaas nirmaan nahin hota or na hi bhavishya main dubaara kharidne ke liye protsaahit hota he
 a major drawback of sales growth is that it can be easily copied by competitors
 iskaa istemaal karte hue hameshaa apane utpaada ko dusro se bhinn nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Nowadays many companies focus on their customers
 iskaa matlab yah he ki companiyon ki gatividhiyaan evam utpaada graahakon ki maang ke anusaar hote hai
 This is usually done in three ways: a customer driven approach, an understanding of market change and an approach to make the product innovative
 upabhokta sanchalit drushtikon ke tahat upabhokta kii maangen ranneetik vipanan faislon kaa nirdhaaran karti hai
 No strategy is adopted until it is successful in consumer research testing
 Every aspect of a product, including the nature of the product, is governed by the needs of the future consumer
 aarambhik bindu sadaiv upabhokta hi hota he
 The logical aspect behind this is that research and development funds should not be spent in preparing a product that people do not want to buy
 History is witness that many products did not run in the market despite being unique examples of technology
 is graahak kendrit vipanan ke aupchaarik drushtikon ko SIVA ke taur par janaa jaataa he 
multah is pranali main graahak par focus karne ke liye chaar p ko nae naam or nae shabd die gaye hai
 The SIVA model offers a demand / customer centric version, an alternative to the well-known 4ps supply model of marketing management
 SIVA model ke chaar tatv hai: The model was proposed by Chekitan Dev and Don Schultz in the Marketing Management Journal of the American Marketing Association and presented in the Market Leader - The Journal of the Marketing Society in the UK
 yah model pramukh taur par graahak par focus karata he In the innovation approach, the company follows product innovation, then develops a market for that product
 utpaada navachaar prakriya ko sanchalit karata he or vipanan anusandhan yah tay karne ke liye kiya jaataa he kii us nae utpaada hetu laabhadaayak bazaar khand maujuud he
 The reasoning is that perhaps customers do not know what options will be available to them in future, then we should not expect them to tell us what they will buy in future
 However, marketers can aggressively adopt and take advantage of product innovation
 utpaada navachaar drushtikon kaa paalan karte vakt vipanak ko yah tay kar lenaa chahie kii unke paas vibhinn evam vividh utpaada navachaar drushtikon hon

 Macro cells can be considered cells where the base station antenna is installed on a pillar or building whose height is higher than the average roof
 Micro cells are those whose antenna height is less than the average ceiling height; They are commonly used in urban areas
 pico cell aise chote cell hai jinka vistaar-vyas kuch darjan meter hi hota he; inkaa upyog mukhya rup se bhawan ke andar kiya jaataa he
 Femto cells are cells that are envisaged for use in residential or small business environments and connected to a service provider's network through a broadband Internet connection
 ambrella cell kaa upyog, chote cell ke chaaya-kshetron ko dhakne or un selon ke bich kii khaali jagah ko bharne ke liye hota he
 The horizontal half-diameter of the cell varies from hundreds of meters to several kilometers depending on the height of the antenna, antenna gain and transmission environment
 vyaavhaarik taur par GSM vinirdesh dwaara samarthit sabase adhik duuri he 35 kilometre ek vistrut cell kii avadharana ke kai karyanvayan hai, jahaan cell kaa arddh vyas antina pranali, bhu-bhaag ke prakaar or agrim samay ke aadhaar par duguna yaa usase bhi zyaada ho saktaa he
 The coverage inside the building is also supported by GSM and can be achieved by using an in-door picocell base station or through an inverter repeater with an internal antenna supplied by an energy breaker, so that the radio signal from the external antenna is distributed separately inside the building
 To be delivered to the system
 These are usually expanded when there is a need for excessive call capacity indoors; For example at large shops or airports
 However, this is not a pre-requisite, as internal coverage is provided by the entry of radio signals from a nearby cell within the building
 jiesem main prayukt adhimishran gausian nunatam-antaran sangyojan he, jo ek prakaar kaa satat-charan fricvency antaran sangyojan he
 In GMSK, the signal to be modulated on the carrier is sweetened with Gaussian low-pass filters prior to supply on the frequency modulator, greatly reducing the risk of interference from neighboring vessels

 GSM networks operate in many different frequency extension ranges
 Most 2G GSM networks operate on the 900 mhz or 1800 mhz band
 kuch amareeki desh 850 mhz or 1900 mhz kaa prayog karte hai, kyonki 900 or 1800 mhz fricvency band pehle hi abantit kiye gaye the
 Most of the 3G GSM networks in Europe operate in the 2100 mhz frequency band
 kuch deshon main durlabh 400 or 450 mhz fricvency band nirdisht kiye gaye hai, jahaan in fricvensiyon kaa upyog pehali peedi kii pranaaliyon ke liye ho rahaa tha
 The GSM-900 uses 890–915 mhz to transmit base station information from the mobile station and 935–960 mhz for other directions, providing 125 RF channels at intervals of 200 khz
 45 mhz kaa duplex antaraal prayukt hota he
 In some countries the GSM-900 band has been expanded to cover a greater frequency zone
 yah mul GSM-900 band main 50 channel jodate hue 'vistrut GSM', E-GSM, 880–915 mhz tathaa 925–960 mhz kaa upyog karata he
 Time division multiplexing is used to allow eight full-rate or sixteen half-rate speech channels per radio frequency channel
 TDMA frem main aath radio samyavadhi samahit hai
 Half-rate channels use alternate frames in the same timeframe
 sabhi 8 channelon ke liye channel data dar 270
833 kbit / s or frem avadhi 4,615 ms hai
 The transmission power of this handset is a maximum of 2 watts in GSM850 / 900 and 1 watt in GSM1800 / 1900
 GSM ne 5
6 tathaa 13 kbit / s ke bich dhwani ko sankuchit karne ke liye kai prakaar ke dhwani kodak kaa istemaal kiya he
 Originally two codecs, namely half-rate and full-rate, have been named based on the type of data channel allocated to them
 inamen ek aisi pranali kaa prayog hua he, jo rekhiy purvakathaneey koding par aadhaarit hoti he
 In addition to being effective towards bitrates, these codecs have made it much easier to identify the more important parts of the sound, making it easier for the air interface layer to preserve and prioritize these signals
 GSM ko 1997 main purna dar channel kaa upyog karne vaale vardhit purna dar kodak, ek 12
2 kbit / s kodak, main viksit kiya gaya
 Finally, with the development of UMTS the EFR was revamped as a variable-rate codec, called amr-narrowband, which is high-quality and robust to interference when used on full-rate channels, as well as, when It is used on a half-rate channel in good radio conditions, so it is less robust but of relatively high quality

 One of the key features of GSM is the Subscriber Identity Module, commonly known as a SIM card
 SIM ek alag kiya ja sakane vaala smart card he, jisamen upyogkarta kii sadsyta-jaankaree or phone book hota he
 This allows the user to store their information even after changing the handset
 vaikalpik rup se, upyogkarta oparator badalane ke liye bina apana handset badale, keval SIM badal kar aisa kar saktaa he
 Some operators interrupt this action by allowing a single SIM in a phone or only by a SIM given by them; This practice is called SIM locking and in some countries it is illegal
 australia, uttari america or europe main kai oparator un mobile ko lock kar dete hai, jinhen ve bechate hai
 This is done because mobile phone prices are generally discounted at the time of subscription and operators want to avoid any concession on their competitors' mobiles
 ek graahak aam taur par kuch shulk dekar is baadha ko dur karne ke liye pradaata se sampark kar saktaa he, yaa phir vah nijee sevaaon ke zariye block ko khol saktaa he, yaa internet par uplabdh tamaam software or web-site kaa upyog karke bhi vah apane handset kaa block khol saktaa he
 Although most web-sites ask for some fee in lieu of block removal, some do so for free
 yah loking handset par lagu hota he, jo uske antarrashtriya mobile upkaran pahchaan sankhya se janaa jaataa he, naa ki khate par In some countries like Bangladesh, Belgium, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Pakistan, all phones are sold without lock
 tathaapi, belgium main operataron dwaara phone kii qeemat par kisi prakaar kii sabsidi dena gair-kanoonee he
 This was also the case in Finland until 1 April 2006, after which it became legal to sell subsidized handsets and accounts, although operators have to open the phone after a certain amount of time without charge
 GSM ko madhyam str kii suraksha ke saath dizine kiya gaya tha
 The system was designed to ensure the user's identity using a pre-shared key and challenge-response
 upyogkarta or base stesan ke bich ke samvaad ko kutabaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 The development of UMTS promotes an alternative USIM, which uses a longer identification key to provide greater security, as well as authenticate the user and network - while GSM only authenticates the user in front of the network
 The security model therefore offers privacy and authentication, but with limited authorization capabilities and without disclaimers
 GSM uses several cryptographic algorithms for security
 A5 / 1 or A5 / 2 stream bijlekh kaa prayog hawa ke upar aawaaj kii gopneeyata sunishchit karne ke liye hota he
 A5 / 1 was developed earlier and is a strong cypher used in Europe and America; A5 / 2 is a bit weak and is used in other countries
 donon bijlekh main gambhir kamajoriyaan pai gai hai: vaastavik samay main A5 / 2 ko keval-bijlekh hamale se toda ja saktaa he or farvari 2008 main, Pico, Computing, Inc ne FPGA kaa labhonmukh kshamta or yojana ko prakat kiya, jiske dwaara A5 / 1 ko renbo teble hamale se toda ja saktaa he
 This system supports several algorithms, allowing operators to replace that cipher with a stronger version

 nauveen pustak main, mia maaikel ke prati apni hinata kii bhaawanaaon ke bare main apane manovaigyanik dow nutz ko bataati he, jisase use ummid thi ki vah kisi behatar saathi ke liye use chhod degaa; judith kii "beyimaani" to use chhodane kaa bahaanaa tha
 She attempts to save her romantic relationship with Michael from ending; He refuses, but they become friends once again
 japan main maaikel ke sanyamee hone kaa sanket miltaa he or baad main vah ek karodpati ban jaataa he
 Mia still loves him; Michael's feelings are no longer clear, although he has previously expressed his serious thoughts of marrying her and becoming her husband
 antim pustak ke antim chor par maaikel mia kaa chumban letaa he or use bataata he ki usne use pyaar karnaa kabhi band nahin kiya tha or yah bhi ki use nahin lagata ki use intjaar karwaanaa uske liye uchit tha
 They later become a strong pair

 Clarice Marie Grimaldi is Renaldo, Patrani of Genovia and Grandmother of Mia
 ek jawan aurat ke rup main, unhone prince rupert renaldo se shaadi kii or unka ek betaa tha jiskaa naam philip tha
 She habitually disappears Mia's mother's surname "thermopolis" from her granddaughter's long list of names and titles
 vah zyaadaatar samay francisi bolti he; haalanki vah angrezi bol leti hai
 He and Mia have a lot in common but she does not notice when Mia is upset, although the two often get knocked up
 vah do sthanon main nivas bhi karti he or jivan-yaapan ke liye uske paas kaaphi dhan he, haalanki vah iske bare main bahut zyada nahin sochati he
 She is a good friend of other royal families such as the Spanish Bourbon family and the English Windsor family

 haalanki uske kathor ravaiye ke kaaran usamen or mia main khaas taur par tab khatpat shuru ho jaati he jab mia ko lagata he ki lily uski aalochana karne lag jaati he
 Lily is not considered to be very attractive, Mia describes her face as a pucker-faced face, although Lily is the mistress of a well-developed stature that gives her many romantic boys

 From the end of the first book to the third book, Mia has an unrequited love for Michael, who eventually revenge these feelings in the third book
 unka prem sambandh mia ke dwitiya varsh tak chalata rahata he lekin jab maaikel japan chalaa jaataa he or mia ko pataa chalata he ki usne judith garsionar ke saath apane sambandh ke bare main sab kuch nahin bataaya tha, vah usase alag ho jaati he
 However, when Michael returns from Japan after almost 2 years and successfully invents the robotic arm that makes him a millionaire, Mia realizes that his feelings for Michael have not disappeared
 bhent hone par maaikel uske saath chhedchhad karata he or ant main uskaa chumban letaa he or uske baad yah ghoshnaa karata he ki vah abhi bhi mia se pyaar karata he or vah uskaa intjaar karegaa
 They reunite at the end of the tenth book

 Mia says that he is the second best looking boy on AEHS and enjoys smelling his neck
 vah mia kaa bahut khyaal rakhata he, yahaan tak ki kabhi-kabhi uske vyavhaar se niraash hone ke baavjood bhi vah uskaa dhyaan rakhata he
 Despite his opposite ideology, he loves Mia just as she does and is keen to marry him
 vah pehle apane pairon par khadaa hona chahta he, jisaki vajah se ant main aathvin pustak main unka algaav ho jaataa he jab maaikel japan chalaa jaataa he
 Mia has always been a little paranoid about her feelings, she thinks that he is too good for her and that Mia feels that she will break away from him if anything goes wrong
 Their eventual separation helps the two become mature and when they reunite, they become a more powerful pair
 jab tak nauven upanyaas main ek bahut bada badlaav nahin hota, jab laana jaitoon shakha pradaan karti he kyonki ab lily mia ke saamaajik chakra kaa hissaa nahin rahi
 Lana and Mia become very good friends, though there is still some awkwardness
