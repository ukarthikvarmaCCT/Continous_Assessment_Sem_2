 nyaayalay main nathuram godse dwaara diye gayi bayaan ke anusaar jis pistaul se gandhi ji ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya vah usne dilli main ek sharnaarthi se kharidi thi
 a total of eight persons, including the main accused Nathuram Godse, were tried in the case of killing Gandhi
 un sabake naam is prakaar hai: Gandhi was attacked 10 days ago during a prayer meeting at Birla Bhavan
 madanlaal paahwa naam ke ek punjabi sharnaarthi ne gandhi ko nishaanaa banaakar bam phenkaa tha lekin us vakt gandhi bal-bal batch gayi
 The bomb exploded on the front wall and broke the wall
 gandhi ne kabhi nahin sochaa hoga ki koi unhen jaan se maarna chahta he
 Gandhi started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi in which he was asked to immediately end communal violence and pay Rs 50 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jaayegaa tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaayegi
 Seeing the insistence of Gandhi, the government paid this amount but Hindu organizations felt that Gandhiji was doing tricks to make Muslims happy
 bam blast kii is ghatana ko gandhi ke is faisle se jodakar dekha gaya
 Nathuram had tried to kill Bapu thrice earlier, but failing he went back to Bombay with his friend Narayan Apte

 Together, they both returned to Delhi on 29 January 1948 and stayed in Retiring Room Number 6 of Delhi Station
 desh ko aaazaad hue abhi mahaj paanch maheene hi beete the ki media main pandit nehru or sardaar patel ke bich matbhedon kii khabar aane lagi thi
 Gandhi was very sad to hear such news coming out and he wanted to answer it
 vah to yahan tak chaahate the ki ve swayan sardaar patel ko istipha dene ko kah den taaki nehru hi sarkaar kaa puraa kaamkaaj dekhen
 But this could not happen
 unhone 30 janvari 1948 ko patel ko baatcheet ke liye chaar baje shaam ko bulaayaa or prarthana khatm hone ke baad is masale par baatcheet karne ko kaha
 But destiny did not approve of it
 patel apni beti maniben ke saath tay samay par ganndhi ke paas pahunch gayi the
 After going to the meeting after meeting with Patel, Gandhi fell victim to Godse's bullets
 gandhi kaha karte the ki unki jindagi ishwar ke haath main he or yadi unhen maranaa hua to koi bachaa nahin saktaa he
 He once said- "those who want security instead of freedom have no right to live
" " haalanki birla bhawan ke get par ek paharedaar jarur rahata tha
 The then Home Minister Sardar Patel ordered the deployment of a head constable and four constables at Birla House as a precautionary measure
 gandhi kii prarthana ke vakt birla bhawan main sade kapadon main police tainaat rahati thi jo har sandigdh vyakti par najar rakhti thi
 However, the police thought that as a precaution, it would be better if the people who come to attend the prayer meeting are searched and allowed to enter the premises of Birla Bhavan
 lekin gandhi ji ko police kaa yah idia pasand nahin aayaa
 An officer of the DIG level of police also talked to Gandhi about this and said that his life may be in danger but Gandhi did not agree
 baapu kii hatya ke baad nandalaal mehta dwaara darz exiaar ke mutabiq unke mukh se niklaa antim shabd 'he ram' tha
 But V
 Kalyanam, who worked as a freedom fighter and private secretary of Gandhi, claims that this is not true
 us ghatana ke vaqt gandhi ke thik peeche khadey kalyanm ne kaha ki goli lagane ke baad gandhi ke munh se ek bhi shabd nikalne kaa sawaal hi nahin tha
 Although Gandhi often used to say that when he dies, the name of Ram will be on his lips
 yadi vah biimaar hote yaa bistar par pade hote to unke munh se jarur 'ram' nikalataa
 The commission set up to investigate the assassination of Gandhi did not even bother to interrogate the people closest to the father on that day
 phir bhi yah duniya bhar main mashhoor ho gaya ki gandhi ke munh se nikle aakhri shabd 'he ram' the
 But it could never be proved
 is baat kii bhi koi jaankaree nahin milti ki goli lagane ke baavjood unhen aspataal le jane ke bajaay birla house main hi waapas kyon le jaaya gaya? It is also believed that a family friend of Mahatma Gandhi kept his ashes in a secret place for about 62 years which was flown into the sea of durban on 30 January 2010
 duniya ko parmaanu kshamta se rou-ba-rou karaane ke baad isaki vidhvansak shakti ke durupyog kii ashanka se pareshaan albert oinstin ahimsa ke pujari mahatma gandhi se milane ko betaab the

 Einstein wrote in the letter- "you have proved by your work that non-violence can be achieved even with people who do not reject the path of violence
" main ummid karata hoon ki aapkaa udhaaharan desh kii simaaon main bandhaa nahin rahegaa balki anterrashtriya str par sthapit hoga
 i hope that one day i will be able to meet you
 " Einstein has written about Bapu that the achievements of Mahatma Gandhi are amazing in political history
 unhone desh ko daastaa se mukt karaane ke liye sangharsh kaa aisa nayaa maarg chunaa jo maanviya or anokhaa he
 It is a path that forces the civilized society of the whole world to think about humanity
 unhone likhaa ki hamen is baat par prasann hona chaiye ki takadir ne hamen apane samay main ek aisa vyakti tohfe main diya jo aane vaali pidiyon ke liye path pradarshak banegaa
 The Congress does not get tired of calling Gandhi as its ideal, whereas the people of the same party used to disrespect Gandhi

 "if i want to die from a mad man's bullet, then i should die smilingly

 " - Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi 28 January 1948 apane sampoorn jeevankaal main mahatma gandhi ne kareeb 35 hajaar patr likhe
 In these letters, Bapu used to address his colleagues, disciples, friends, relatives etc
 under his pseudonym

 mujhe is baat kii santushti mili ki jo kaam main kar rahaa hoon vah aapaki drushti main sahi he
 i hope to meet you face to face in my ashram in India
 " Was it not the responsibility of Jawaharlal Nehru who was the Prime Minister of the country, or Sardar Patel, who was the Home Minister? Finally, on January 20, 1948, just 10 days after Pahwa bombing of Gandhiji's prayer meeting, Nathuram Godse, a member of the same group in the same prayer meeting, took 3 bullets in Gandhi's chest and ended them forever

 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya

 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas

 Syntactic is a famous Sanskrit grammar book
 ise trikandi bhi kehete hai
 Syntactic grammar is the main philosophical text of the series
 iske rachayita nitishatak ke rachayita mahavaiyaakaran tathaa yogiraj bhartruhari hai
 His guru's name was Vasurat
 bhartruhari ko kisi ne teesri, kisi ne chauthi tathaa chhathi yaa saatvi sadi main rakhaa he
 In the phrase, Bhartrihari has expressed his views on the nature of language and its relation to the external world
 yah granth teen bhaagon main vibhakt he jinhen "cond" kehete hai
 This entire book is written in verse
 pratham "brahmakand" he jisamen 157 karikas hai, doosraa "vaakyakand he jisamen 493 karikas hai or teesraa "padcand" ke naam se prasiddh he
 Its first episode is Brahmakanda in which the nature of the word is explained
 isamen shabd ko brahm mana gaya he or brahm kii prapti ke liye shabd ko pramukh saadhan bataaya gaya he
 In the second episode, Bhartrihari has given different views about the sentence
 tisare kand main anya darshanik ritiyon ke vishyon, jaise - jati, dravya, kaal aadi kii charchaa kii gayi he
 In this, Bhartrihari tries to show that diverse views illuminate different dimensions of the same object
 is prakaar ve sabhi darshanon ko apane vyakaran aadhaarit darshan dwaara ekikaran karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Grammar scripture is basically Agam Shastra
 isaki abhivyakti maheshwar se he
 According to Agam, the word has four forms - "para", "pashyanti", "madhyama" and "vaikhari"
 inamen "para" hi brahm he
 That is why in the first sentence of the phrase, word is called eternal and infinite and the letter Brahm
 isi pararup brahm se sansar ke padaarthon kii utpatti tathaa vyavhaar vivartarup main mana gaya he
 In the first episode, there is a view of the philosophical form of syllogism, hence it is named "brahmakanda" and has been proved to be a simple form
 vastut: yah aagmik cond he
 It is written from the point of view of Agama
 is cond kii kuch upyogi tathaa jaanane yogya baaten ye hai- The methods and form of attainment of that Brahma have been called "vedas" by the Maharishi
 yah ek hota hua bhi anek maaloom hota he
 That is why the four Vedas are called Rakyajush, Sama and Atharvan
 rugveda kii 21, yajurveda kii 100, samaveda kii 1000 tathaa atharvaveda kii 9 milakar 1130 shakhaayen veda kii hui
 Even then, the only propitious subject of all the Vedas and their branches is "karma"
 yah samaran rakhana he ki jo shabd yaa mantra jis swar main jis shakha main padhaa gaya he vah shabd usee tarah uccharan kiye jane par fal denevaala hota he
 Reading the same word in the same branch in the same form will result in this interpretation, otherwise it will not give any other fruit
 aagam ke bina kartavya evam akartavya kaa nishchay nahin ho saktaa
 The knowledge of seeing imperceptible things among sages is also obtained through Agama
 tark ke dwaara koi yatharth gyaan nahin praapt ho saktaa, vah parivartansheel he
 For the higher level sages, the past and future are all visible
 gyaan ke swaprakash hone ke kaaran usamen aatma kaa swaroop tathaa ghat aadi gyey padaarth kaa swaroop donon bhaasith hote hai
 Similarly, the word has both its form of meaning and its own form
 jis prakaar jayapushp ke ke laal rup se sambhddha hi sphatik kaa grahan hota he usee prakaar sphot se mili hui dhwani kaa hi grahan hota he
 No one is of the opinion that just as the quality of senses is insensitive and is the cause of knowledge of subjects, similarly sound is the reason for knowledge of words without being insensitive
 doosraa mat he ki "doortv" dosha ke kaaran sphot ke swaroop kaa gyaan nahin hota, keval dhwani kaa hi bhaan hota he
 The third view is that there is a feeling of explosion but remains unstable due to the distance defect, such that the "magnitude" of an object is not clearly captured due to distance
 anuon main sabhi prakaar kii shaktiyaan hai, isiilie bhed or sansarg rup main anuon se kaary hote hai
 These molecules transform into the form of shadow, atom, tamas and words
 ye shaktiyaan abhivyakt hone ke samay main bade praytn se prerit kii jaati hai
 And just as clouds are formed, the atoms of the word gather together and do all the work
 in parmaanuon kaa naam "shabd" yaa "shabdaparmaanu" he
 In this way, the interpretation of the inductive nature of the word and the creation of the entire world by the word itself is in the Brahmand
 dwitiya cond main "pad" vaachak he yaa "vaakya" iskaa vishad vichaar he
 Different opinions are criticized
 isi cond main bhartruhari ne kaha he - shabd or arth ek hi paramtatv ke do bhed hai jo pruthak nahin rahete 
 Rishis have direct knowledge of the element but cannot be treated with it
 isliye vyavhaar ke samay un anirvachaneey tatwon kaa jis prakaar log vyavhaar karte hon usee tarah sabhi ko karnaa chahie 
 Everyone considers "genius" to be authentic, and with this strength, people also know the behavior of birds
 beej bone ke saath saath "laah" kaa ras aadi padaarth ke mila dene se us beej ke falon ke rang main tathaa uske falon main bhed ho jaataa he
 The process of "scripture" is meant only to convince ignorant people, not to represent the element
 shastron main prakriyaaon ke dwaara avidya kaa hi vichaar he
 After the supersession of "avidya", the scriptural process devoid of the alternatives of Agama appears as "vidya" when it is nullified
 isiilie kaha he ki asaty ke maarg ke dwaara hi satya kii prapti hoti he, jaise baalkon ko padhaate samay unhen pehle shastron kaa pratipaadan keval prataranmaatr hota he
 Etc
 Philosophically, the idea of elements of grammar is in the second case in 493 karkas
 tisare cond main "padvichaar" kaa prakram kiya gaya he
 Posts are tested by meaning
 nyaay-vaisheshik ke mat main akaash main saamaanya nahin he kintu vaakyapadiya ke anusaar mukhya yaa oupaadhik deshbhed ke kaaran akaash main bhi jati he 
 "knowledge" is self-effacement
 vishyagyaan tathaa uskaa paramarshgyan, ye donon bhinn hai
 There are 13 sections in this scandal in which philosophical grammar has been given philosophically in more than 450 karyas
 yah cond khandit hi he
 On the phrase, Bhutiraj's son Helraj has written a very beautiful and detailed commentary
 aadhunik samay main bhi kuch vidwaanon ne tikaa likhi he kintu in sabaki drushti aagmik na hone ke kaaran vaakyapadiya kaa vaastavik gyaan nahin praapt hota
 Many of its activities appear to have been destroyed
 yudhisthir mimasak tathaa sadhuraam ne lupt karikaon par kuch vichaar kiye hai
 Other texts, similar to this treatise, are not much in consideration of the grammatical form
 mahim durg yaa mahim kaa kila mumbai ke mahim ilaake main sthit hai
 There were many wars in history for this fort

 Here is a partial list of Nokia products

 Nokia also makes other devices such as television
 phone main boldphase se arth he ki phone simbian operating system par aadhaarit he, jise smartphone
s = Status, where p indicates under production, and d is discontinued Like the 1000 series, the 2000 series are entry-level phones
 However, the 2000 series generally contain more advanced features than the 1000 series; many new 2000 series phones feature color screens and some feature cameras and / or Bluetooth
 The 2000 series slot between the 1000 and 3000 series phones in terms of features
 The nokia 3000 series are mostly mid-range phones targeted towards the youth market
 Some of the models in this series are targeted towards young male users, in contrast with the more unisex business-oriented 6000 series and the more feminine fashion-oriented 7000 series
 Feature wise, the 3000 series slot between the 2000 and 6000 series
 The Nokia 5000 series are similar in features to the 3000 series, but often contain more features towards active individuals
 Many of the 5000 series phones feature a rugged construction or contain extra features for music playback
 The 5210 features rubber xpress-on shells, WAP over CSD and a built in thermometer
 The thermometer is actually the internal temperature of the phone's battery, this feature is also present on other phones that have "netmonitor" enabled
 The 5210 is nicknamed a "builder's phone" because of its rubber splash / impact proof casing
 Its successor is the 5100 and after that, the 5140 and 5140i
 The 5510 was Nokia's first phone with a built in MP3 player, and it had 64 megabytes of memory for storing mp3s
 It also had a full QWERTY keyboard and an 84 x 48 monochrome display
 This phone did not sell very well even though it was advertised on television, possibly because it was too expensive and too big
 Its replacement is the Nokia 3300
 The nokia 6000 series is nokia's largest family of phones
 It consists mostly of mid-range to high-end phones containing a high amount of features
 The 6000 series is notable for their conservative, unisex designs, which make them popular among business users
 Nokia 6136 UMA is the first mobile phone to include Unlicenced Mobile Access
 Nokia 6131 NFC is the first mobile phone to include Near Field Communication
 The nokia 7000 series is a family of nokia phones with two uses
 Most phones in the 7000 series are targeted towards fashion-conscious users, particularly towards women
 Some phones in this family also test new features
 The 7000 series are considered to be a more consumer-oriented family of phones when contrasted to the business-oriented 6000 series
 The 7110 was the first Nokia phone with a WAP browser
 WAP was significantly hyped up during the 1998–2000 Internet boom
 However WAP did not meet these expectations and uptake was limited
 Another industry first was the flap, which slid from below the phone with a push from the release button
 Unfortunately the cover was not too durable
 The 7110 was also the only phone to feature a navi-roller key
 The 7250i was a slightly improved version of the nokia 7250
 It includes XHTML and OMA Forward lock digital rights management
 The phone has the exact same design as the 7250
 This phone is far more popular than the 7250 and has been made available on pre-paid packages and therefore it is very popular amongst youths in the UK and other European countries
 The 7650 was the first Series 60 smartphone of Nokia
 It was quite basic compared to new smartphones, it didn't have MMC slot, but it had a camera
 The 7610 was Nokia's first smartphone featuring a megapixel camera, and is targeted towards the fashion conscious individual
 End-users can also use the 7610 with Nokia Lifeblog
 Other pre-installed applications include the Opera and Kodak Photo Sharing
 It is notable for its looks, having opposite corners rounded off
 It comes with a 64 MB Reduced Size MMC
 The main CPU is an ARM compatible chip running at 123 mhz
 The 7710's 640 x 320 screen is a touch screen
 This series is characterized by ergonomics and attractiveness
 The internals of the phone are similar to those in different series and so on that level offer nothing particularly different, however the physical handset itself offers a level of functionality which appeals to users who focus on ergonomics
 The front slide keypad covers offered a pseudo-flip that at the time Nokia were unwilling to make
 Materials used increased the cost and hence exclusivity of these handsets
 The only exception to the rule is the 82xx, 8310 which were very small and light handsets
 The newest Communicator, the E90 Communicator, is an Eseries phone
 Vertu is an independent company, owned by nokia, that manufactures exclusively hand crafted high-end mobile phones
 Materials used include platinum, 18 carat white gold, 18 carat yellow gold, stainless steel, ruby keypad bearings, and a sapphire crystal display for the 'signature' and leather, 316L Surgical stainless steel and Liquidmetal for the 'ascent'
 nokia is working toward the future of phones and mobile communication devices with their new concept phone, the nokia "scentsory"
 This new mobile device uses the sense of smell, sight, hearing, and touch to create a multiscensory environment for the caller
 Scentsory would be able to detect, send, and emit smells, as well as radiate colors, lighting, and temperature from the environment of the caller
 Dual screens can be used for personal video messaging as well as watching videos
 Scentsory also includes features such as an LED touchpad, hidden camera, and folding "origami" design, revolutionizing not only features previously foreign to the phone, but introducing a new physical design to the phone
 IP appliances run IPSO freebsd based operating system, work with Check Point's firewall and VPN products
 nokia Network Voyager is an ssl-secured, Web-based element management interface
 In 2004, Nokia began offering their own SSL VPN devices based on IP Security Platforms and the pre-hardened Nokia IPSO operating system
 Client integrity scanning and endpoint security technology was obtained from Positive Networks
 On August 24, 2009, nokia announced that they will be entering the PC business with a high-end netbook called the nokia Booklet 3G
 Nokia produces accessories to their products too many to list here
 Such accessories include: nokia manufactured a series of personal computers in the 1980s
 Nokia was also known for producing very high quality CRT and early TFT LCD displays for PC and larger systems application
 The Nokia Display Products' branded business was sold to viewsonic in 2000
 nokia used to manufacture digital set-top boxes
 Nokia has also developed the Sanomalaitejärjestelmä for Finnish Defense Forces
 It includes: In the past, nokia has produced at one time or another:<ref name="towards Telecommunications Virginia Ragi, an Italian lawyer and currently mayor of Rome, was elected the first female mayor of Rome, the Italian capital, on June 20, 2016

 Just above it is a showy but beautiful replica
 neeche tak aam paryatakon ko pahunch nahin di gai he
 The entire building uses a marble mosaic called the Petra Dura and this type of tomb placement is an important part of indo-islamic architecture, which has been used extensively in the later tombs of the Mughal Empire, such as the Taj Mahal
 mukhya kaksh main sangmarmar kii jalidaar ghere ke thik upar mehrab bhi bana he, jo pashchim main makka kii ore bana he
 There is a line of sura-un-noor, usually at the entrance, instead of Sura 24 of the Quran, through which light enters the Qibla

 In these small rooms, the tombs of many Mughal Nawabs and courtiers are built from time to time
 inamen se pramukh hai hamida bano begum or daara shikoh kii kabren
 Including the first floor, this main building has more than 100 tombs, most of which do not have the identity of the person buried due to the inscription, but it is certain that they are from the royal family or courtiers of the Mughal Empire
 Were, so the building is labeled as the cemetery of the Mughals
 is imaarat main laal baluapathar par shwet sangmarmar ke sangyojan kaa sarvapratham prayog kiya gaya tha
 Along with this, there are many components of Indian architecture, such as small canopies of Rajasthani architecture enclosing the main dome, which were originally covered with blue tiles

 Humayun's Tomb Interior pashchim kii ore makka ko mukh kiye hue jharokhe main baarik kati sangmarmar kii jaali Humayun's tomb, in the main chamber; The original grave is built in the lower chamber
 chote kaksh mehrabadar jaali se dhanke hue hai
 The construction of the main building took eight years, but its full beauty is enhanced by the Charbagh-style Mughal gardens spread over 30 acres surrounding it
 ye udyaan bharat hi nahin varan dakshin asia main apni prakaar ke pehle udhaaharan the
 These are examples of high-grade geometry
 jananath rupi udyaan chaharadivari ke bheetar bana he
 The park is divided into four sections by walking paths and two dividing central waterways
 ye islam ke jananath ke baag main bahane vaali chaar nadiyon ke parichaayak hai
 The four gardens thus constructed are again divided into four smaller parts by stone paths
 is prakaar kul milakar 36 bhaag banate hai
 The central water pipe from the main gate to the mausoleum seems to go under it and reappear from the other side, just as the 'garden of paradise' is described in the verses of the Quran
 makbare ko ghere hue charbagh hai, va unhen ghere hue teen ore oonchi pathar kii chaharadivari he va teesri ore kabhi nikat hi yamuna nadi baha karti thi, jo samay ke saath parisar se dur chali gai he
 Central walkways lead to two gates: one main gate in the southern wall and the other small gate in the western wall
