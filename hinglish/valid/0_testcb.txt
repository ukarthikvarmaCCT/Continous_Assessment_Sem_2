 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday praised several news channels, including NDTV, in his radio message Mann Ki Baat while talking about cleanliness
 unhone kaha ki alag-alag tivi prograamon ke jariye safai ko lekar jaagrukta failaane main madad mili he
 Prime Minister Modi's point may be true for the metros, but the situation seems to be the same in small towns
 udhaaharan ke liye chunaav ke daur se guzar rahe bihar ke ek shahar madhubani ko lete hai
 Despite Modi's nationwide campaign, cleanliness is not an issue in Bihar elections
 bijepi ne bhi ise koi mudda nahin banaaya he
 However, in TV advertisements, Modi is definitely seen trying to spread awareness
 lekin iskaa madhubani chitrakala ke liye duniya bhar main vikhyath is shahar par koi asar nahin dikhataa
 Heaps of dirt are visible all around
 sthaneey nivasee gopal khan bataate hai ki log ghar kaa kooda sadak par daal jane kii maansikta se ubar nahin paae hai
 Municipal cleaners do sweep in the morning, but not enough
 haal main kooda uthaane vaali ek aadhunik gaadi bhi kharidi gai lekin kareeb 10 varg kilometre ke shahari ilaake main isse kaam nahin chalata
 The comments shahar kii sabase badi samasya he jal nikasi kii samuchit vyavastha kaa na hona
 There are three canals here, Watson Canal, King Canal and Raj Canal, but none of them have been confirmed
 madhubani ke mukhya kaaryakari abhiyantaa sansadhano kii kami kii duhai dete hue kehete hai ki nagarpalika uplabdh sansadhano main behatar karne kii koshish kar rahi he lekin jal nikasi kii pukhta vyavastha hone tak shahar ko gandagi or jal jamaav se dur rakhana sambhav nahin

 Overall, changing people's thinking towards cleanliness in small cities is still a challenge, while infrastructure development is a bigger challenge
 uske bina koi bhi vigyaapan shahar main safai nahin laa saktaa
 Take for example Madhubani, a city in Bihar undergoing elections
 modi ke deshvyapee abhiyaan ke baavjood awwal to bihar chunaav main saaf-safai ko mudda nahin he
 BJP has also not made it an issue
 alabatta tivi vigyapanon main modi jaagrukta failaane kii koshish karte jarur najar aate hai
 But it does not have any effect on this city, which is famous worldwide for Madhubani painting
 gandagi ke dher chaaron taraf dikh jate hai
 Local resident Gopal Khan says that people have not recovered from the mentality of dumping garbage on the road
 nagarpalika ke safai karmchaaree subah jhaadu jarur lagaate hai lekin yah kaaphi nahin
 Recently a modern garbage car was also purchased but it does not work in the urban area of about 10 square kilometers
 tippaniyan The biggest problem of the city is lack of proper drainage system
 yahaan teen canal hai, watasan canal, king canal or raaj canal, lekin inamen se kisi kaa pakkikaran nahin hua he
 Chief Executive Engineer of Madhubani, citing lack of resources, says that the municipality is trying to improve the available resources but it is not possible to keep the city away from dirt and water logging until a strong drainage system is in place
 ve kehete hai ki canal ke pakkikaran ke liye raashi manjuur ho chuki he lekin use aavantit nahin kiya gaya he
 So the drains are buzzing
 kul milakar yahi ki chote shaharon main saaf-safai ke prati logon kii soch ko badalanaa abhi bhi ek chunauti he vahiin dhanchaagat vikaas usase bhi badi chunauti
 Without him, no advertisement can bring cleanliness to the city

 The assassination of Sardar Patel Indira Gandhi, who was born on 31 October 1875, is celebrated on 31 October 1984, on 31 October 1984, on 31 October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 bharat kii raajnneeti main yah din 2 myanon main behad ahm he
 The first falls on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel on 31 October, and the second on the same day, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 2014 main centre main satta main aane par usee saal oktober main pehle grih mantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii jayanti ke uplakshya main 31 oktober ko rashtriya ekta diwas manaane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Since then, this unity day is celebrated every year
 sardaar patelpatel ke naam par aage badhate gaye modiazadee ke baadacongress raaj main sardaar patelki bhoomika zyada nahin dikhi, lekin narendra modi ne sardaar ko apane raajnneetik kariyar main shaamil kiya jo aaj bhi jari he
 Modi is believed to have included Sardar Patel in his speeches after 2003
 uske baad unhone apane sambodhan main gujarat or sardaar patel ko lagaataar shaamil kiye rakhaa
 Since 2006, this trend has been gaining momentum
 ab modi centre main hai or pichley saadhe 5 saal se pradhanmantri hai or unke raaj main 31 oktober ko rashtriya ekta diwas ke rup main manaaya ja rahaa he
 On October 31, Indira Gandhi was shot dead by her own security forces
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar apane bhaashanon main 31 oktober ko yaad karte hue kehete hai ki ek purv pradhanmantri kii hatya suraksha kii kami ke kaaran kar di gai
 Therefore, security is very important in the country
 pandit nehru ke saath sardaar patelpatel ne aitihaasik kaam kiya31 oktober kaa zikr karte hue piem modi ne pichley dinon apane sambodhan main sardaar patel or purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ko bhi yaad kiya tha
 On one hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel did the historic work of uniting the princely states
 unki najar jahaan hyderabad, junagarh or anya rajyon par kendrit thi to vahiin unka dhyaan dakshin main lakshadweep jaise chote ilaakon par bhi tha
 Sardar Patel (gettyimages) with Mahatma Gandhi, while Prime Minister Modi while referring to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, said that Indira Gandhi was killed on 31 October
 desh ko us vakt bada sadma laga tha
 Today i pay tribute to him
 centre main aane ke baad narendra modi ne 31 oktober ko ekta diwas kaa elaan kar ek saath do nishane saadhane kii koshish kii he
 Modi's attempt is to make the people in his favor through nationalism in the name of Sardar Patel, while referring to the threat of unity on Indira Gandhi's assassination on the same day, we want to talk about taking tough decisions
 pichley ek maheene se puri duniya use dhund rahi he
 For the last one month, it has created a rage all over Iraq
 wo duniya ke darjanabhar mulkon par kabja kar ek islamic desh bananaa chahta he, jiskaa khalipha wo khud bananaa chahta he
 It is said that he is also dangerous than Osama
 ab tak paheli bana duniya ke sabase khatarnaak aatankwaadi abu bakar al bagdadi shuukravaar ko achaanak saamne aa gaya
 For the past one month, the whole world has been looking for him
 pichley ek maheene se puure iraq main usne koharaam machaa rakhaa he
 He wants to capture a dozen countries of the world and create an Islamic country, whose Khalifa he wants to become himself
 kehete hai wo osama se bhi khatarnaak he
 But till now he himself has never appeared
 bas tak uski do hi tasviren duniyabar kii khufia agenciyon ke paas thim
 But surprisingly, the world's most dangerous terrorist Abu Bakr al-baghdadi suddenly reached a mosque in Iraq on Friday
 bagdadi ne baghdad kii gaddi ko hilaakar rakh diya he
 He has created a slaughterhouse in Iraq
 uske sir par 60 karod kaa inaam ghoshit he
 He is called the world's most merciless terrorist
 Baghdadi has been the culprit of every bullet and fall corpse in Iraq since last month
 baghdad ke baad iraq ke duusare sabase bade shahar mosul kii nuruddin masjid main jume kii namaaj se thik pehle bagdadi apane suraksha daste ke saath achaanak vahaan aa pahunchaa
 After this, before the prayer of Jumme, he addressed the people who came to offer Namaz there
 uske sambodhan ke dauraan masjid ke andar bahut saare namaji the
 After about 20 minutes of address, Baghdadi descended and then offered prayers on the spot
 yani wo is masajid main imam kii haisiyat se aayaa tha
 This is the first time Baghdadi has come out in public
 wo naa sirf saamne aayaa balki khud apana video bhi shoot karaayaa
 Apparently this video has not been shot without his will or has surfaced
 jis mosul shahar kaa ye video he, iraq kaa wo shahar bhi bagdadi ke kabje main he
 In this video, after offering prayers, Baghdadi appealed to Sunni Muslims around the world to join her war
 usne elaan kiya ki jaise hi uskaa ek islamic desh banane kaa sapana puraa hoga, vaise hi duniyabar ke musalamaanon ko unki izzat, maan-sammaan, adhikaar sab mil jayega
 However, after a fight between ISIS and Iraqi forces in Anbar a few days ago, there was speculation that Baghdadi was badly injured in this fight
 andeshaa jataayaa ja rahaa he ki bagdadi un atakalon ko galat sabit karnaa chahta he or isiilie is video ke jariye wo khud duniya ke saamne aayaa he
 The motive of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi is not just a bloodbath in Iraq
 uske iraade isse kahin zyada khatarnaak hai
 Baghdad is just the beginning of Baghdadi, in fact it wants to create an Islamic emirate through Baghdad via Syria including the Levant countries ie Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Turkey and has also declared this new country
 
 16 may 2010 ko iesas ke mukhiya ke taur par duniya ke is sabase amir aatankwaadi sanghathan kii kaman sanbhaalane vaala bagdadi pehle se alqaida ke commander osma bin laden kaa mureed rahaa he
 He wants to avenge the death of al-qaeda's mentor
 bagdadi kaa asal makasad teen charnon main banta he
 The first motive-seeker wants to capture Iraq and Syria first, to achieve success in his dangerous plan
 sach ye he ki wo apane is makasad main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab bhi ho chukaa he
 Its fighters have captured parts of Syria
 iske saath hi iraq ke kai shaharon par bhi iesas ke aatankwaadi kabja jamaaye baithe hai
 Second motive: The second objective of Baghdadi is not just to win Iraq and Syria, but it wants to create an Islamic Emirate by joining all the Levant countries ie Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Turkey
 teesraa makasadabagadadi kaa sapana itnaa hi nahin he
 After capturing these countries, it also wants to capture Pakistan and Afghanistan
 bagdadi apana samrajya hindustan main gujarat samet uttar pashchami rajyon tak failaana chahta he or yahi bagdadi kaa asal makasad bhi he
 According to experts, Baghdadi wants to become 'the Islamic State of Khorasan'
 agar abu bakar al bagdadi apane makasad main kaamyaab ho gaya to yakeenan duniya kaa nakshaa badal jayega
 But the shocking thing is that a lot of terrorists of India have joined ISIS
 kuch maheene pehle syria ke rajdoot is baat kaa khulaasa bhi kar chuke hai ki hindustan ke jehadi unke desh me bashar sarkaar ke khilaaf jang main shaamil ho chuke hai
 If this thing is true then one thing is certain that in the coming times, ISIS can become a major threat to India as well
 lekin iraq par kabja karne ke iraade se katl-e-aam machaa rahaa bagdadi apane torget main naa sirf bahut aage nikal chukaa he, balki iraq ke saath-saath puri duniya ke liye ek sirdard sabit hone vaala he
 Because he has announced to create a separate country 'the Islamic State' a few days ago and his country includes the areas and cities of Syria and Iraq which he and his terrorists have occupied
 ye abu bakar al bagdadi hi he, jisaki aguwai main iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne naa sirf iraq ke duusare bade shahar mosul ko apane kabje main kar liya, balki mosul ke central bank se 500 billian iraqi dinar yani takreeban 25 sau karod rupee lut kar duniya kii sabase badi bank lut kaa itihaas bhi apane naam kar liya he
 Baghdadi has havoc on one side in Iraq and Baghdad on the other
 june kaa puraa maheenaa guzar gaya he, magar naa to bagdadi kaa kahar rukaa or naa hi baghdad uske kahar ko roak paaya he
 As a result, more than two and a half thousand people died on the streets of Iraq in this one month alone
 maut kaa ye aankada or bhi daraavna ho saktaa he
 Because in the United Nations, many Sunni-dominated areas in Iraq are still difficult to reach and the news is that there are no dead bodies to be found on the streets in these areas even today
 kyonki iraqi fouj yaa duusare antarrashtriya sanghathanon kii vahaan tak pahunch hi nahin he
 The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorists are playing a bloody death in the cities they occupy
 wo pakade gaye iraqi sainikon kaa saream shahar kii sadakon par katl kar rahe hai
 According to Nikolay Mladinov, the United Nations representative in Iraq, 2417 people have been killed in the ongoing fighting between ISIS and the Iraqi army in June alone
 marane waalon main 1531 aam naagarik or 886 sainik hai
 How many Iraqis and how many foreigners are there among these ordinary citizens is not known at the moment
 bhartiya aatankwaadi bhi badagdadi kii fouj mensutron kii maane to hindustan ke kuch aatankwaadi bhi abu-bakar-al-bagdadi kaa saath de rahe hai
 Indian intelligence agencies have launched a lookout circular against a person of Indian origin
 is shaks kaa naam haji fakruddin osman ali bataaya ja rahaa he
 According to him, this man is in the grip of entering India and that is why he is being searched at every airport and port in the country
 khufia agenciyon ke sutron ke mutabik ye shaks tamilnadu kaa rahane vaala he or kuch saal pehle wo bijnes ke silsile main singapore chalaa gaya tha
 There he met a henchman of Baghdadi and at the behest of Usman Ali Baghdadi, in the ongoing civil war in Syria, ISIS participated in the war
 lekin wo bharat main kis makasad se aa rahaa he ye ab tak kisi ko bhi nahin pataa he
 But the intelligence agencies fear that Osman Ali is coming to India at the behest of Baghdadi and his purpose is to spread terror here
 vaise bhartiya khufia agenciyaan is baat kaa anumaan nahin laga pain hai ki iraq or syria main kitne bhartiya abu-bakar-al-bagdadi kii madad kar rahe hai yaa phir uski taraf se lard rahe hai
 But according to him, a large number of young boys from India have gone to West Asia and some of these boys have also been given military training by terrorists
 jaahir he agar abu-bakar-al-bagdadi ke badhate kadamon ko jaldi nahin roka gaya to wo al-kaayda ke baad puri duniya ke liye ek nayaa sirdard ban jayega
 a sewer line can be laid in about 30 colonies in 1 year
 In 1993, about 607 colonies were made regularized
 The Monitoring Committee of listasupreme Court opposed the regularization of 1797 colonies in July this year, citing that they were regularized
 Do not do this because their regularization will increase the burden on the infrastructure manifold
 vahiin, court ne special task force ko aadesh diya ki do hafte main public road or footpath se kabje hataae jaaen
 What does the Town Planner say? On this, Town Planner AK Jain has clearly said, "according to the Standard Master Plan, sewer lines can be laid in about 30 colonies in 1 year
 is hisaab se 1797 coloniyon kii siver line bichaane main kareeb 30 saal lag sakate hai
 The Monitoring Committee told the Supreme Court that in 1993 a list was made to regulate about 607 colonies
 aadhe se zyada coloniyon ko niyamit bhi kar diya gaya lekin adhiktar coloniyaan aisi hai jahaan abhi tak siver line nahin bich pai he
 Town Planning Department not in Delhi Government Delhi Government is a government which does not have a Town Planning Department
 sabhi rajya sarkaron ke paas yah department hota he
 There is an Urban Development Department which has engineers and consultants, but the work of regularization should not be left even above the private sector
 toun planar eke jain kaa saaf taur par kahana he ki regularigeshan tabhi sambhav he jab arial survey, physical survey, land onership or regularigeshan plan bana kar publish kiya jaae
 Therefore, experts say, 'no colony has worked in this way till date
 aage se in chizon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie'
 Delhi's master plan is the planning law of Delhi and it is also a legal document
 master plan ke provijan ke mutabik kareeb 1800 avaidh coloniyon ko regularigeshan kiya jayega
 All illegal colonies up to 2017 have been said to be regularized
 ab dekhnaa yah he avaidh coloniyon ke regular hone kaa rasta sarkari tareeke se badhata he yaa phir adalati rukh par nirbhar karegaa
 Patidar leader Hardik Patel is being seen as a game changer in the Gujarat elections
 kuch dinon pehle hue sidi cond se gujarat kii chunavi raajnneeti main ek nayaa bavaal khadaa ho gaya he
 This damaged or benefited Hardik's image
 yah to chunaav ke nattejey bataaenge
 However, he directly blamed the BJP for the CD scandal
 vahiin agenda ajtak 2017 ke khaas satr 'phir ek baar bijepi sarkaar?' main gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani ne sidi cond par bhi jawaab diya ki is sidi cond se bijepi kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that Hardik's porn CD was prepared by his friends only
 vahiin jisane yah sidi taiyaar kii, vah kah chukaa he ki uske paas aise or sidi hai
 Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that the BJP has nothing to do with this CD scandal
 hamen koi matlab nahin he
 The Patidar society is also unhappy with them
 mukhyamantri vijay roopaani ne kaha kibijapichunaav jeet rahi he, aise main use aisi chijen karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Let us tell you that a CD of 24-year-old Patidar leader Hardik Patel went viral, in which Hardik Patel was allegedly seen in a room with a woman
 hardik ne sidi jari hone ke baad kaha tha ki maine pehle bhi kaha tha ki in logon kaa master plan gandi raajnneeti kii ore chalata ja rahaa he
 Vijay Rupani said that PM has talked about development

 People of Gujarat are businessmen and have chosen BJP and will elect

 Vijay Rupani said that after 75 years we do not have the custom of CM

 Rupani said that it takes a few months to repair a new system like GST
 vahiin kendra sarkaar pehle hi kah chuki thi ki jiesti lagu hone ke 3 maheene baad isamen jaruri sudhaar kiye jaaenge
 Rupani said that everyone in the GST Council wanted the GST to be implemented immediately
 kisi rajya yaa raajnneetik dal ne ise july main lagu karne kaa virodh nahin kiya tha
 When the Congress in-charge Gehlot had to go to a gathering of businessmen to talk on the Congress GST, the traders shouted Modi

 in Our lives make a big difference in how our neighbors are
 agar hamaare padosi achche hai to hamaari rosemara kii kai choti-badi baton kii phikr yun hi khatm ho jaati he
 On the other hand, if the neighbors are fussing, quarreling over the matter, then even after not wanting, the mind is upset
 ghar aakarbhi wo sukun nahin mil paata he, jo ghar par milanaa chahie
 Many times, some neighbors are also found who are interested in your life more than their lives
 unhen aisa lagata he ki padosi hone ke naate ye unka janmasiddh haq he ki wo kuch bhi puch sakate hai
 Many times you face such neighbors by being calm or avoiding them, but sometimes these routes are not able to prove to be effective
 agar aapako lagata he ki aapkaa padosi bhi kuch aisa hi he to in tareekon ko apana hai:1
 Neighbors often have a habit of trying to listen to your home as they go
 aise main koshish kiijie ki aap jab bhi koi aisi baat kar rahe hon to aapke ghar kii khidkiyaan or daravaaje band hon
 They should have curtains on them
 2
 To avoid neighbor's interference, you can get jaalis done at the door-door
 saath hi daravaajon par lata vaale paudhe lagaakar bhi aap unase duuri bana sakati hai
 3
 agar aap apane padosi ke ghar se aane vaale shor seppereshaan ho chuke hanto usase saaf-saaf baat kar lenaa hi behatar hoga
 Despite this, if they do not listen to you, then you can talk to the secretary of the society
 4
 If your neighbor repeatedly tries to know your personal things with you, then you try to postpone it
 ho saktaa he ki use aapkaa ye ishaara samaj aa jaae
 5
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki akele hone kii vajah se yaa phir aapako khush karne ke liye aapkaa padosi dusron kii chugali kare
 Instead of keeping him entertained on these things, it would be better to avoid
 aap ne sabhi kendron kii vistrut jaanch ucchtam nyaayalay kii nigaraanee main vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) se karaane kii maang kii he
 The AAP also demands that the managers of the three centers against whom evidence is presented at this time should be arrested immediately, so that the real perpetrator of the scam can be reached

 Common people are facing a lot of trouble due to this strike
 auto chaalkon kaa kahana he ki ek hajaar se zyada auto kaa permit radd kar diya gaya he
 When they tried to find out the reason for this, the officials said that your permit is for Noida and how can you take auto outside Noida
 yahi vajah he ki jo auto noida ke bahaar pakde ja rahe hai unka permit radd kiya ja rahaa he
 There are about 6 thousand autos currently running in Noida
 haalaaki auto chaalkon kii hadtaal se aam logon ko kaaphi pareshaani uthaani pad rahi he
 If someone is late for office, then someone is going to college
 auto kii hadtaal se sabhi pareshaan hai or logo ko aane-jane ke liye ghanto bas yaa rickshaw kaa intjaar karnaa pad rahaa he
 People say that the strike should end soon
 root badhaane or permit sahit kul 13 sutreey maang ko lekar auto hadtaal par gaye hai
 The strike is in protest against the cancellation of cancellation permits of 1000 CNG autos and tempo registered in Noida and Greater Noida and not meeting 12 other demands
 auto vaale kai maheenon se dilli kii tarj par noida or greater noida main bhi thri seater auto main meter lagane ke saath hi root nirdhaaran karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, there is also a demand to set a fare of Rs 10 per km
 sienji auto union ke president choudhary omprakash gurjar ne kaha ki hamaari maang he ki transport department or trephic police kii ore se 1 hajaar sienji auto ke cancel kiye gaye permit ko phir se behaal kiya jaae
 Noida auto drivers are now raising questions that Noida's autos are being banned, but why the law is different for them when Ghaziabad and Delhi autos come to Noida
 auto chaalkon kii maang he ki kanoon sabake liye ek ho
 They say they are on strike for this reason
 auto chaalkon ne dhamkee di he ki agar prashasan ne jald hi radd permit kaa navinikaran nahin kiya to ye hadtaal jari rahegi
 Noida auto drivers are also not allowing autos coming from Delhi to run in Noida
 auto chaalkon kii hadtaal se aam log kaaphi pareshaan hai agar jald hi koi samaadhaan nahin niklaa to aane vaale samay main logon ko kaaphi pareshaani ho sakati he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is considered to be one of the quietest cricketers in cricket history
 apane is swabhaav ke jariye vipakshi team ko bhaanpane main vah maharath hasil rakhte hai
 Dhoni has one more thing apart from this amazing quality, which sets him apart from others
 or yah he unka 'mind game'
 When Dhoni took charge of Team India, the 'mind Game' emerged as an important aspect of his captaincy
 is kadi main australia ke khilaaf unka vah 'mind game' shaamil he, jisase kangaroo hill gaye the
 In the recently published book 'the Dhoni Touch', this quality of Dhoni is discussed
 dhoni kaa bathroom VIDEO viral, jaaniye kya kaha kool maahi ne
 
 ?bharat sundereshan ke is kitaab main 2008 ke us vaakye kaa zikr he, jab dhoni ne sibi siries ke dauraan australia ke khilaaf jeet kii dahalij par pahunchakar apni team se aagrah kiya tha ki vah jeet kaa jashn na manaae
 Then this 'decree' of Dhoni in the team India camp was like an incomprehensible puzzle
 aakhir dhoni ne aisa kyon kaha
 
 ? darasal, dhoni australian kheme tak apana sandesh pahunchaana chaahate the ki unke khilaaf bharat ke liye yah jeet koi badi baat nahin he or na hi yah koi ulatpher he
 It was only 15th ODI for Dhoni as the captain of Team India
 australia 2007 kii world cap champion team thi
 It was the fourth match of the 2008 CB Series when the Indian team bowled Australia for just 159 runs in Melbourne on 10 February
 iske baad bharat ne yah maamuli lakshya paanch wicket ganvaa kar hasil kiya tha
 At that time Dhoni (17 runs) returned unbeaten with Rohit Sharma (39 runs) helping India win
 maje kii baat to yah ki jab jeet ke liye mahaj 10 ranon kii jarurat thi, to dhoni ne gloves mangavaaye or apana sandesh dressing room tak pahunchaaya tha
 He wanted the players not to come on the balcony and celebrate
 darasal, cricket main kisi na kisi bahaane dressing room se maidan tak sandesh pahunchaae jane kii parampara rahi he, lekin dhoni ne thik iske ulta kiya
 According to the book, Dhoni said - My bowlers all dismissed him and we chased a target of 160 runs

 Today is Sir Syed Day
 aligarh muslim uniwarsity ke chaatro ke liye bada din he
 Its students fondly remember its founder
 wo apane vajood main unke vajood ko bhi jodate hai
 Aligarh Muslim University's old students have organizations in so many cities that they should say yes to all their programs, you will not return home for two to three years
 main is saal atlanta gaya tha
 Talked to 73-year-old Hasan Kamal there
 jitne din unke saath rahaa, ve bas aligarh ke nae chaatro kii madad or mulk kii behatari kii baat karte rahe
 Whatever the case used to be, he used to roam around how to give good books to the students of the media there
 behtareen training di jaae
 Even when interrupted, they used to say that you do not understand
 vakt bahut kam he
 Will have to train well yah hamaara bhi farz he
 The students of Aligarh also know whether any Hassan Kamal saheb thinks so much for them
 unke kaaran kuch aise hi jununee logon se mulaaqaat hui jo apane chaatro kii har sambhav madad ke liye betaab the
 To help with both money and skills
 hasan kamaal vaise to behad kuubasurat bhi hai or insaan bhi bade achche
 The people of the city of their work know from a distance like a student of Aligarh would know the streets of their city
 unki mustaidi kaa qaayal ho gaya
 Is wearing a watch in his hand
 ai-phone vaali
 Keep track of steps
 shaayad isiilie feet bhi hai
 i think that Aligarh Muslim University is always seen by keeping within the scope of images born of UP politics
 us raajnneeti ke jawaab main yah uniwarsity bhi waisi hi dikhne lag jaati he
 While there is no need
 aligarh ke chaatro ko apni mehnat or eemaandaaree par bharosa rakhana chahie
 The achievements of the students of a university in a town in UP are more than any university
 jis upi main koi uniwarsity naam lene laayak nahin bachi he, yah badi baat he ki uske chaatr har pal aligarh ko yaad karte hai
 Live Aligarh
 ek baar aap inke kaarykram main chale jaaiye
 They will fill Aligarh in you
 vahaan ke kamare, vahaan ke khaane, vahaan kii badmashiyaan or latifen
 Memories are there but we do things like live telecasts
 shaayad hi koi aisa ho to khud ko mazaaj yaa gaalib kaa ustad na samajhataa ho
 Poetry in everything
 mujhe lagata he ki aligarh ne apane chaatro kii uplabdhiyon ko thik se sanjoya nahi
 So let me start this
 is baar na sahi, agali baar jab aap sar sayed de manaaen to iske chaatro kii uplabdhiyon ko yaad karen
 Dr
 Shoaib Ahmed
 1984 main rampur se skool kii padhai kar aligarh muslim uniwarsity pahunche
 Master in Biochemistry there
 uske baad Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, lakhanu se em phil kii
 He then went to Britain and did his phd from the Wells College of Medicine in Cardiff
 iske baad uniwarsity of south carolina, las angelis se post doctoral kii padhai kii
 In this way, a boy from Rampur decides his journey from 1984 to 2003
 aligarh muslim uniwarsity ne paanch saal ke dauraan unhen chemistry or baio chemistry main itnaa daksh kar diya ki ve do or mulkon kii uniwarsity main apana research kar sake
 Ten years thereafter taught at Emroy University School of Medicine in Atlanta
 lekin kam bolne vaale shoeb ahamed ke bheetar aligarh uniwarsity is tarah basii he jaise kal hi nikle hon
 This is Aligarh
 aapke bheetar se nikalataa nahin he
 Dr
 Shoaib currently runs a company called mygenomics
 cancer kii screening karte hai
 Samples come from all over the world and they check and tell how much someone is suspected of getting cancer
 chance he
 That is, we do our work now
 ham america yaa baahar gaye logon kii kamyaabi ko paise se aankate hai
 If you did this then you would be wrong to understand Dr
 Shoaib's journey
 photography kaa shauq rakhte hai
 His car has good cameras in his trunk
 drone camere kaa seoup he
 Took us by car to a village in Atlanta
 drone camere ko aazamaa rahe the or photography par lacture de hi rahe the ki tractor daudaate hue kisaan aa gaya
 For once we felt that we were surrounded in Shamli! But well dow shoeb ke saath kuch ghante bitaane kaa mauqaa mila
 Their entire conversation ended in how the country would improve
 wo hindustan ko behad pyaar karte hai
 Want to connect the students of your university with the new round of research
 rampur or aligarh main gum-gum kar khaane kii aadat lagi hogi isliye unhen koob pataa tha ki atlanta kaa local khaanaa-pinaa kya he
 It is a matter of pride for any university that a student who turned out 25 years ago thinks day and night for his students
 bolne kaa saleeqa acha he
 If one speaks less then the mistake is reduced and when he speaks the other, he puts forward his courage
 inaki zabaan se urdu utari nahin he
 English has not gone sour
 jabaki inkaa pesha or research angrezi kaa hi he
 Is a very beautiful family
 agle post me main aapako pani kii takanic par kaam karne vaale syed rizvi sahab, yasir jinase dosti ho gai he or anya kuch logon kii kamyaabi ke bare main bataaungaa
 When will i write, it depends on my mood
 meraa bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aligarh uniwarsity ko aap uske maqasad ke chalate yaad karte hai to uskaa ek behatar tareeqa yah bhi he
 Recall the students who came out of this chaman
 aap sabhi ko mubaaraq
 May your Aligarh Muslim University adorn you and keep traveling ahead of you with its beautiful memories
 manthan ajtak 2017 ke pehle satr 'kahaan gaya vipaksh' main maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke adhyaksh raaj thakare ne shirkat kii
 This session was conducted by Sahil Joshi
 is satr main raaj thakare ne notebandi, modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj, gujarat chunaav, bijepi kii ranneeti or bhavishya main vipaksh kii bhoomika sahit tamaam sawaalon par vistaar se baat kii
 In the beginning of the bjp's strategy, whether Dawood's arrest or war is like Kargil, Sahil Joshi asked why did he show Dawood Ibrahim and Narendra Modi together in one of his recently made cartoons? Raj Thackeray said that through this cartoon, his attempt was to give a satire
 thakare ne kaha ki unki jaankaree ke mutabik 2019 chunaav ke liye bijepi sarkaar kii taiyaari he ki vah daaud ko pakistan se bharat lekar aaenge or daawa karenge ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne itane dashakon ke baad use bharat laane main safalataa pai he
 Raj Thackeray said that Dawood Ibrahim himself really wants him to come to India
 aisa isliye ki uskaa swasth thik nahin he or vah apni jindagi ke aakhri pal bharat main gujaarna chahta he
 Thackeray said that the Modi government of the country wants to pull out the 2019 elections with this support
 yadi kisi kaaran vah daaud ko nahin laa paae to unki koshish koi danga yaa kargil jaise yuddh kaa sahaara lete hue jeet hasil karne kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Not anti Gujarati but not even bullet train brick, Dungraj Thackeray was asked whether he has been working on anti Gujarati image in the last few years? After all, why are they opposing projects like bullet train? Thackeray said that 1 lakh crore rupees is needed to overcome the problem of railways in the country
 is paise se bhartiya rail puri tarah se durust ho sakati he
 So why is it being tried to create a petition between Mumbai and Ahmedabad by taking a loan of 1 lakh 10 thousand crore rupees
 thakare ne kaha ki yadi ahmedabad ko bullate train kii jarurat he to kyon uski is jarurat ke liye puure desh ko haashie par rakhaa jaae
 It will not just bear the burden of debt
 iskaa bhaar puure desh ke upar padana tay he
 Thackeray said why the states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar or Maharashtra should be under this debt
 lihaaja unki koshish hogi ki vah maharashtra main bullate train kii ek eent bhi nahin lagane denge
 Demonetisation only to weaken the opposition
 The Prime Minister came on TV at 8 pm last year and announced that the country's most important currency has now become a piece of paper
 is faisle ke baad agle din bainkon ke baahar lambii-lambii qatari lag gai
 Many people also died in these queues
 lekin hakeekat dekhie ki desh main kahaan-kahaan kitni badi rakam baraamad kii gai
 In such a situation, what was the benefit of this demonetization
 raaj thakare ne daawa kiya ki unki jaankaree ke mutabik modi sarkaar ne apni jarurat ke liye badi maatra main nai karency kii printing karai he
 With this demonetisation, only the effort was made that the opposition would not have any kind of fund and that it would remain a weak opposition without funds
 raaj thakare ne bijepi ko lagaataar mil rahi jeet par sawaal uthaate hue iske liye iviem mashin ko bhi kuch had tak jimmedaar mana
 Raj Thackeray said that EVM machines are planned, this theory is also running
 dilli kii sarkaar ne vidhansabha main mashin hack kar dikhaai thi
 The Election Commission is not providing the real machine to prove hacking
 raaj thakare ne kaha ki railway kii puri samasyaayein thik kerani hai to kakodakar samiti kii report ke mutabik ek lakh karod rupee kii jarurat hogi
 That is, the one lakh crores in which the railways of the whole country can be cured, why is it being spent in bullet train only on the way of mumbai-ahmedabad
 bullate train isliye hoti he taaki lanbaa safar kam samay main tay ho jaae jaise kashmir se kanyakumari, dilli se mumbai yaa chennai
 This is not necessary in mumbai-ahmedabad, but a loan of one lakh ten thousand crores is being taken for some Gujaratis, whose interest is paid in states like UP, Karnataka Punjab
 raaj thakare ne kaha ki aaj soshal media bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf zyada mukhar he
 The social media using which the BJP came to power, now when all this is coming on top of it, it is on the way of repression and firs are being lodged against those who write against the Modi government
