 Aditi had twelve sons, of whom Mitra, Varuna, Dhata, Aryama, Ansh, Bhag, Vivasvan, Aditya, Rudra, Indra, etc
 are prominent
 khagoleey drushti se antariksh main dwadash aditya bhraman karte hai, ve aditya aditi ke putr hai
 His sons attained divinity only by the virtue of Aditi
 aditi kaa ek putr garbh main hi mrityu ko praapt ho gaya tha
 But Aditi revived him with his power
 us putr kaa naam maartand tha
 He is present in space for Marthand Vishwakalyan
 rugveda main aditi ko mata ke rup main sweekaara gaya he
 Twenty mantras are said in that Veda in praise of that Mother Goddess

 The Sun God was pleased with Aditi's tenacity
 unhone saakshaat darshan diye or vardaan maangane ko kaha
 Aditi praised Surya
 tatpashchaat aditi dwaara vardaan maanga gaya ki – “aap mere putr rup main janm lewein”
 Over a period of time, the sun's glory was established in Aditi's womb
 kintu ek baar aditi or kashyap ke madhya kalah utpann ho gaya
 In anger, Kashyap addressed Aditi's womb with the word "dead"
 usee samay aditi ke garbh se ek prakashpunj baahar aayaa
 Kashyap got frightened after seeing that light
 kashyap ne surya se kshamaa yachana kii

 That will fulfill the desire of both of you and will be located in the universe
 samyaantar main us puddj se tejasvi balak utpann hua
 He is also known as "aditya" or "martand"
 aditya kaa tej asahneeya tha
 Therefore, in the battle, the demons fled only after seeing Aditya's glory

 Over time, Diti's body became weak
 ek baar aditi kii aagyaanusaar indra diti kii seva karne ke liye gaya
 Indra deceitfully divided Diti's womb into seven
 jab wein shishu rudan kar rahe the, tab indra ne kaha – “maa rudantu” 
 Then again seven departments of each womb were done
 is prakaar unchaas putron kaa janm hua
 They are called Marudgan, who is forty-nine
 indra ke abhadra kaary se cruddh diti aditi ko shaap detii he ki – “indra kaa rajya sheeghra hi nasht ho jayega
 As Aditi dropped my womb, so too her son will be destroyed at birth ”
 shaap ke prabhaav se hi dwaparayug main kashyap rishi kaa vasudev ke swaroop main, aditi kaa devaki ke rup main or diti kaa rohinee ke rup main janm hua
 Seven sons of Devaki were killed by Kansa in prison

 At that time, Kashyapa was doing penance in the sage forest
 jab unka tap purna hua, to aditi ne devon kii sthiti sunai
 He also asked for measures for the welfare of the Gods
 payovrat purvak vishnu kii bhakthi kaa upaay kashyap rishi ne bataaya
 Lord Vishnu was worshiped by Aditi
 kuch dino ke anantar bhagavan vishnu prasann hue
 Lord Vishnu appeared and said - "O God! You have worshiped me with devotion
 atah “main aapke garbh se avatar dhaaran karuunga
 He will be my Vamana avatar
 main daityon kaa sanhaar or devon kaa rakshan karuunga” ye aapako var detaa hoon
 Kashyapa Rishi was a prophet
 atah vah purv hi agavat the ki – “vishnu aditi ke garbh se vaaman avatar dhaaran karenge” 
 Then he entered Aditi's womb with his glory
 samyaantar main bhagavan vishnu kaa vaaman avatar hua

 Trita is the central and esoteric doctrine of Christianity related to the inward form of God, which is called trinity
 tritv kaa arth he ki ek hi ishwar main teen vyakti hai -- pita, putr tathaa pavitra aatma 
 These three are equally eternal, infinite and omnipotent because human wisdom can reach the existence of only one almighty creator God by reason of logic
 vastut: tritv ke dharmasiddhant par isiliye vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki uski shiksha isa ne di he
 The first half of the Bible shows that monotheism was given special emphasis in Judaism
 bible ke uttarardh main isa us akeshwar ko banaae rakhte hue bhi yah shiksha dete hai ki main or param pita parameshwar ek hi hai 
 Apart from this, he tells his disciples that i will send the Holy Spirit away and will be with you in a dark way
 us pavitra aatma ko bhi vah ishwariya gunon se samanvit maanate hai
 In this way Jesus clearly states that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit exist in the same God
 baad main tryek ishwar kii is visheshta ko tritv kaa naam diya gaya he
 Christianity has tried to explain this doctrine of the Trinity with the help of Greek and Latin philosophical terms - three persons exist in the same divine nature
 teenon tatvat: ek hai
 Hence, all three have the same determination and the same intelligence
 phir bhi pita, putr or pavitra aatma main parsparik bhinnata he
 Father is not born to anyone
 putr adikaal se pita se paripurna ishwartv grahan karata he
 This origin of the son is called fertility
 pavitra aatma kii utpatti ko prajnan kehete hai
 The origin of the Holy Spirit is believed to be from both father and son and is called diffusion
 putr ke prajnan tathaa pavitra aatma se prasaran se teenon vyaktiyon kii parsparik bhinnata utpann hoti he, kintu tatvat: teenon ek hai or samaan rup se sabhi ishwariya gunon se samanvit hai
 
 shatabdiyon tak is dharmasiddhant par chintan kiya gaya he or tatvasambandhi anek dharanaon ko bhraamak tehraaya gaya he
 Trinityism, which assumes three distinct divine elements, is clearly misleading, since the existence of three independent deities is thus acknowledged
 modalism ke anusaar pita, putr or pavitra aatma ek hi ishwar ke teen pahalu hai jo sristi ke kaaran utpann ho jate hai -- pita srishtikarta he, putr hamaara uddhaar karata he tathaa pavitra aatma hamako pavitra karata he
 The church rejected this suit in the third and fourth centuries, stating that before creation, there were three persons in God
 nisea kii vishwasabha ne tritv vishyak un sabhi vyakhyaaon ko bhraamak tehraaya he jinke anusaar putr athwa pavitra aatma pita se gaun maane jate hai
 In that assembly it is clearly declared that father and son are essentially the same

 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii

 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha

 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di

 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life

 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute

 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
