 kisi tikaakar ne iskaa shringaar pradhan kavy ke rup main varnan kiya he to kisi ne bhakthi sampradaay ko mahatva dekar ise bhakthi kavy mana; to kisi ne sangeet ko pradhanta dekar ise sangeet shaastra kaa rup diya he evam kisi-kisi tikaakar ne shabdamadhurya or saushthav ko lekar isaki shabd vyutpatyatmak vyakhya kii he
 Hence, Geetgovind is undoubtedly an all-inclusive independent text
 gitgovind ke pratham tikaakar udaynacharya ne ‘bhavavibhavini’ tikaa likhi he
 Udayanacharya, who lives on the banks of Prachi, very close to Jagannath Puri, was a dear friend and admirer of Jade Dev

 The description of all these forms of love, apart from being very interesting, succulent and lively, is so beautiful that it seems as if the poet is translating it into poetry by giving the scripture, that is, the form of emotion to the mind, or the abstract into tangible form

 It has 12 chapters in total
 yah kavy odisha rajya ke bhubaneshwar or puri shahar ke madhyavarti kendubilva yaa kenduli shashan naam ke gaanv main vaas karne vaale brahman jayadev ki kriti he
 Jaidev, with the help of his wife Padmavati, made such a change that Tatkalin started to be the king of Utkal
 phir jab gitgovind ki praadhanya jagannatha ji ne swapn main raja ko bataayi tab se mandir ke devadasi raat ke ekaant seva or subah ki seva main prabhu jagannatha ke saamne odishi nrity rup main pesh karne lage
 Earlier scholars believed that Jayadeva is the councilor of the king of Bengal
 par shilaalekh evam pracheen mandir jo odisha main maujuud he, unase pramanit hua ki jayadev jagannatha ke bhakt the or utkal rajya ke vaasi the
 Even today, Geetgovind Sarvajanin is becoming beloved through Odissi dance
 odishi nrity hi jayadev kaa odisha praant k hona suchit karata he
 His Geetagovind poetry was propagated in Padoshi, Andhra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 phir uttarbharat main khaastaur par rajasthan main mirabai ke dwaara hua
 In Gurugranth Sahib, we also write the name of Bhagat Jayadev, who is the author of Geetgovind
 ‘gitgovind’ kavy kaa rachana-kaushal is prakaar sarvatha naveen evam nitant moulik he ki uske kavy-rup kaa nirnay karnaa hi dushkar ban gaya he
 Some Western scholars call it 'rustic-metaphor', while other reviewers call it 'gitanatak', in some others it is a 'sophisticated journey'
 pishelle is kavy ko ‘sangeet roopak’ sweekaar karte hai
 Levi considers this to be an intermediate or coordinated form of song and metaphor, but Jayadeva has divided his work into cantos and alluded to his conception of poetry as a place of drama
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki is kavy main naatak kii bhaanti ank, prastaavna aadi kuch bhi nahin he
 Some scholars also call it 'shringar Epic'
 krishnaswami ayangaar ne apane granth ‘a history of indian opera' main ‘gitgovind’ kavy ko sangeetnataka kaa ek purvarup mana he or uskaa vikaas evam utkrisht paripaak solahavin shatabdi ke shri tirthanarayan swami kii rachana ‘krishnalila tarangini’ main sweekaar kiya he
 In this regard, Acharya Baldev Upadhyay's premise is based on the assumption that the names of ragas and talas with the words of 'gitagovind' infer the fact that the poet's sight may have been towards the Mahotsavas prevalent in Bengal in those days
 , Which used songs with dance and music
 is aadhaar par is kavy ko ‘sangitaroopak’ bhi mana ja saktaa he
 Nature has a very important place in the depiction of human beauty
 is sandarbh main ‘gitgovind’ kavy main ruturaj vasant, chandra-jyotsna, surabhit samir tathaa yamuna tat ke mohak kunjon kaa bada hi sundar varnan dekhne ko miltaa he
 Even in this poetry, birds are visible to the bird singing the power of love and glory
 jayadev ne is kavy main vaidarbhi reeti—maadhurya vyanjak varnon vaali style—kaa prayog kiya he
 In poetry, long spans have been used at some places, but still there was no sense of obscurity
 vastutah kavi ne vishesh-vishesh utsavon par sarv-saadhaaran ke gane ke liye hi to geeton kii rachana kii thi
 Therefore, it was necessary to keep them comprehensible
 geeton main na keval asaadhaaran swaabhaaviktaa he, apitu unamem anupam maadhurya bhi he
 In praise of the composition style of 'gitagovind', macdonal says - "there is no resemblance of 'gitagovind' poetic style in the entire Sanskrit literature in beauty, in musical utterances and in the beauty of composition
 kavy ke adhyayan se spasht ho jaataa he ki kavi main kahin laghu padon kii vegavati dhara dwaara, to kahin chaaturya ke saath rachit deergh samaason kii laypurna gati dwaara apane pathakon-shrotaaon par yathesht prabhaav daalane kii adbhut kshamta he
 The poet Nana is unique not only in the use of verses, but also in bringing rhetoric between the middle and the end of the steps
 ’’ In 'geetgovind' poetry, Jayadev has adopted an all new and original style by not following the traditional composition system
 shloke, gadhy or geet ke mili-jule prayog dwaara kavy main anupam rachana-maadhurya kii sristi hui he
 The poet has used shlokas in descriptive contexts such as the visual planning or stage-specific depiction required for sustaining the narrative
 paatro kii manodasha ko suchit karne vaale sanvadatmak prasangon main gadhy kaa prayog hua he tathaa bhavanubhuti kii abhivyanjana padyon main kii gayi he
 Thus, in the innovative composition system adopted in 'geetgovind', the characters, dialogues and songs are interwoven in such a way that they feel a unique joy
 is anupam rachana-style ke aavishkarta jayadev, apane upmaan aap hi hai
 radha-krishna's racy portrayal of the Keli stories and his convergent pastimes make Geetagovind a captivating book of spiritual adornment
 radha-krishna ke pranay ke chithran main prem kii vividh dashaon—aashaa, niraashaa, utkantha, irshyaa, coup, maan, aakrosh, milanotsukata, sandesh-preshan tathaa milan aadi—kaa jaisaa abhibhoot karne vaala hridaygrahi chithran is kavy main hua he, vaisaa anyatra dhundhane par bhi kahin nahin miltaa
 Radha does not like or tolerate raas-vilas with Sri Krishna's gopis
 radha apni sakhi ke madhyam se shrikrishna ke prati apana aakroshamulak upalambh bhejti he, parantu us anany pranyini ko itane se santosh nahin hota, uskaa prem nirbhar-hriday use apane priyatam ke prati apane pragadh anuraag ko vyaktigat rup se prakat karne ko vivash kar detaa he
 On the arrival of Radha, Shri Krishna leaves Braj and the beauties and is oriented towards him
 radha kii sakhi shrikrishna se radha kii or radha se shrikrishna kii ek-duusare main gahan anurakti kaa tathaa ek-duusare se dur rahane par anubhav kii ja rahi virahajanya vednaa kaa maarmik varnan karti he
 She inspires the two to meet each other with her soft and gentle words
 chandroday hone par pranay-vyathaa se adheer bani radha apane uddipt anuraag par niyantran nahin rakh paati or uski abhivyakti ko vivash ho jaati he
 Radha expresses her anger and resentment towards him with utterances filled with utterances upon Shri Krishna's arrival
 idhar radha kii sakhi radha se maan ko chhodane kaa anurodh karti he udhar swayan shrikrishna radha ke rup-soundarya kii prashansa ke vyaaj se uski chatukaarita karte hue use manaane evam apane anukool banane kii cheshtaa karte hai
 Eventually Radha's values go away and she goes to kadamba-kunj to meet her Kant
 vahaan shrikrishna radha se pranay-yachana karte hue usase lajja-sankoch ko chhodane kaa anurodh tathaa rati-bhoga main sahyog dene kaa manuhaar karte hai
 Both of them indulge in a rishi play with a happy mind, and after this Radha asks Pranayasikthan utterances to make her adornment to her beloved Shri Krishna
 apni pranpriya ke anurodh ko gaurav dete hue shrikrishna saharsha apane haathon se radha kaa shringaar karte hai
 Some critics today accuse Jayadeva of making devotion to radha-krishna as an adornment, but this blasphemy on the poet worshiping the melody is not only unjust but his own indiscretion
 vastutah daampaty pranay main uplabdh tanmayata athwa talleenta ke charam utkarsh kii tathaa bhed main abhed kii kalpana ke chudant nidarshan kii abhivyakti hi bhakthi ke kshetra main maadhurya bhav kii sristi karti he
 For the devotees who worship with a sweet sentiment, the beautiful gestures, luxuries and love stories of God are lyrical and noteworthy
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki vidwaanon ne is saare kavy ko 'aprastut prashansa' maanakar vaacharth main chhipe vyangyarth ko vyakt karne kaa prayaas sweekaar kiya he
 According to his opinion, Shri Krishna is the symbol of 'soul of creatures'
 gopiyon kii krida anek prakaar kaa vah prapanch he, jisamen agyaan-avasthaa main fansi manushyon kii aatma bhatakati rahati he
 Radha is the symbol of Brahmanand, only on achieving that, the individual gets extreme happiness
 katipay vidwaanon ke anusaar jayadev radha kaa upaask na hokar shrikrishna ke hi upaask the
 Therefore, Krishna is not a symbol of the soul of humans but a symbol of God
 is tathy ko vaani dete hue acharya baldev upaadhyaay likhte hai—‘‘shringaar-shiromani shrikrishna bhagwat-tatva ke pratinidhi hai or unki premi gopikaayen jeev kii pratik hai
 The union of radha-krishna is the union of jiva-brahma
 is prakaar sadhana maarg ke anek tathyon ke rahasy ko yahaan suljhaayaa gaya he
 '' ‘gitgovind’ vastutah ek anupam evam adbhut granth he, jiske uddaam-shringaar ke antstal main rahasyamayi maadhurya bhaavana kii nigudh dhara bah rahi he
 In the entire Sanskrit literature, no other composition of this category is sweet
 sanskrit bharti ke soundarya or maadhurya kii paraakaashtha kaa avlokan karnaa ho, to ‘gitgovind’ kaa anushilan karnaa chahie
 Its vignette depicts beauty as it is
 iske geeton ke pad-laalitya alokik maadhurya kaa sanchaar karata he
 The beauty of its verses provides unbeatable joy
 shabd or arth kaa saamanjasy aisa manomuguakari he ki sanskrit se aparichit vyakti bhi usase prabhavit hue bina nahin rah saktaa
 Its Komalakant phrase is rare in the poetry of any language of the world
 is kavy main prayukt deergh samaason main bhi vilakshan prasadikta evam swar-maadhurya he
 The poet is unique in the use of alliteration
 unke geeton main anupras kaa prayog padon ke ant main hi nahin, madhya main bhi apni chata bikherta hua chalata he
 Such a gem-glass combination of fine verses and the Komalakant phrase has been made that the mere expression of the songs leads to the emergence and communication of the corresponding rasa in the hearts of the millennials
 shringaar kii vyanjana ke liye yah anuthi style badi hi sarthak siddh hui he
 'geetgovind' gained immense fame and popularity
 jayadev ne jis gram main rahete hue ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana kii, us gaanv kaa naam hi jayadevapur pad gaya
 King Pratap Rudradeva of Orissa, a contemporary of the poet, issued an order for singers, musicians and dancers of his kingdom to sing the verses of 'geetgovind'
 maharaj ne jayadev ko is kavy rachana ke liye ‘kavirajraj’ kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit kiya
 'geetgovind' had become sufficiently popular and popular during Jayadeva's lifetime - many evidences are found
 dakshin main to vah itnaa adhik prachlit ho gaya ki iske padyon ko tirupati balaji ke mandir kii sidhiyon par dravin lipi main khudhvaya gaya
 In the Shrivallabh sect, it has the same reputation as the Srimad Bhagavat Purana
 vaishnavon main yah vishwaas he ki ‘gitgovind’ jahaan gaaya jaataa he, vahaan bhagwaan kaa avashya hi pradurbhaav hota he
 Due to this, a law has been made not to sing it in an inappropriate place in this community, which is strictly followed
 vaishnav sampradaay main jayadev kavi ko is sampradaay kii madhyavastha kaa mukhya mahanubhav mana gaya he
 According to the following verse prevalent in the community, the Vishnu Swami, who was promoted by Vishnu Swami and promoted by Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya, gave protection to the community by the devotee poet Jayadeva in the midst of these two great personalities
 is prakaar vaishnav sampradaay main jayadev bhi guru ke rup main vandaneey hai— Jayadeva invented a new formulation system in Sanskrit by creating 'geetgovind'
 ‘gitgovind’ ke anukaran par sanskrit main ‘abhinav gitgovind’, ‘gitaraghav’, ‘gitgangadhar’ tathaa ‘krishnagit’ jaise anek geet kaavyon kii rachana hui, parantu koi bhi kavi apane kavy main ‘gitgovind’ jaisi utkrushtataa laane main safal nahin hua
 Here in India, Bharatendu Harishchandra tried to translate it in Brajbhasha, but the translation of 'true poetry' cannot be done - this statement has proved to be literally true in relation to 'geetgovind'
 anuwaad main mul rachana ke ras-bhav kii avatarana asambhav nahin, to kathin avashya he
 The German poet Goethe's comment on the translation of the 'geetgovind' poem in the Anglo-language by Sir William Jones is very accurate
 ‘A Real Poetry is that, which cannot be translated
’’ arthath utkrisht kavita kii pahchaan kaa aadhaar hi yahi he ki uskaa duusari bhashaa main anuwaad nahin ho saktaa
 Thirty-five scholarly efforts are available to understand the song of 'gitagovind' and to communicate its beauty to the gentlemen, but this poem is such a deep ocean that anyone who dips deep into it
 uske haath main utane hi durlabh evam bahumoolya ratna aa jate hai
 Poetry composed by some poets on the emulation of this poetry is a sign of Jaydev's acceptance of kirti-kaumudi's lightness and excellence
 bhakthi, shringaar or kavitv kii trivenirup ‘gitgovind’ kavy kaa krishna-bhakthi sahitya main ek anya drushti se bhi ullekhneey mahatva he
 It is a well-known fact that before this poetry, the names of Rukmini and Satyabhama were used as the beloved or wife of Shri Krishna
 radha naam kii kisi stri kaa koi astitv nahin tha
 In the Srimad Bhagavat Purana, there is a mention of one Gopi worshiping 'anayaradhito Nunam' Sri Krishna, but there is no mention of Shri Krishna's beloved wife, Radha, who attained importance at the same time as Krishna who joined with Krishna
 
 radha ko is ucch sthaan—shrikrishna kii anany sahachari evam unase abhinn tathaa unki nityashaktirupa—par pratishthit karne ke shrey ‘gitgovindakaar’ jayadev ko hi praapt he
 On the basis of the continual vilas of radha-krishna depicted in this book, the Brahma Vyavarta Purana describes the beauty and actions of radha-krishna, but it is a harsh truth that the Puranakas neither describe 'geetagovind' poetry
 No one has been able to sustain dignity and decency, nor has the description been made as simple, interesting and heart-warming
 is kshetra main bhi jayadev apane upmaan aap hi hai
 It is on this basis that perhaps 'geetagovind' poetry in krishna-bhakti literature has the distinction of scripture

 Jagriti Yatra Jagriti Seva Sansthan is a non-governmental undertaking that promotes enterprise-generated development and entrepreneurship]
 ye 2008 se prarambh ho kar ab tak 4 baar yojit ho chukaa he
 Jagriti Yatra means the journey to be awakened
 ye yatra saamaajik jaagran kii yatra he
 Indian and foreign youth of 20 to 25 years of age can apply to join this yatra and people older than that can join as an ally in this yatra
 ye rail yatra 18 dinon main labhag 9000 kilometre kii duuri tay karti he
 It revolves around the whole of India, passing through all the states of India
 yatra ke 2011 sanskaran main bharat ke 24 rajyo or 23 vibhinn deshon ke pratibhaagi hai
 Jagriti Yatra is an annual national rail journey that takes enthusiastic Indian youth and some foreigners to all the regions of India for 18 days
 18 dibbon ke ye railgadee 20,000 aavedakon main se chune gayi 400 yuvakon or yuvatiyon ko lekar un diggaj saamaajik or vyavsaayik udhyamiyon se milwane or seekhney ke liye je laati he, jinhone jamini sachai se takkar le kar kuch aisa kar dikhaaya he ki aaj duniya unka loha maanati he - inamen se kai jinhen log jaanate bhi nahin
 It is tried that the youth will get encouragement from these enterprises and will also solve some problem on their own
 ye yatra chaar baar safaltapurvak yojit kii ja chuki he or ab lagbhag sabhi udhyami yuvaaon ke dil main sthaan bana chuki he
 Apart from traveling, some programs are organized throughout the year so that travelers and other people are connected to each other

 Speeches are also organized through teleconference facility on special days of the year, such as International Women's Day, Republic Day
 jagriti yatra dhire dhire udhyam-janit-vikaas ke andolan ko yuvaaon ke bich prasfutit karne ke system ke rup main ubhar rahi he
 Its main aim is to infuse the spirit of entrepreneurship among the youth
 yuvaaon ko unheen jaise magar diggaj logon se milwa kar jagriti yatra apane is lakshay tak pahunchnaa chaahati he
 According to people associated with Jagriti Yatra, till now many young people have been encouraged to start this venture

 There are about 35 crore people who are living in extreme poverty, who do not even know from where the food will come tonight
 in donon ke bich main ek madhya-bharat he jo ki kareeb 50 rupee se 200 rupee rose ke kama rahe hai, thik-thaak rah rahaa he, kha le rahaa he, magar dishaheenata se bharaa pada he
 This middle-india is made up of a family of any city, which is earning around Rs
 20,000 a month, the youth of that family make every effort for the job
 kuch naukari paa bhi jate hai, magar baaki apana hi kuch dhandha shuru karte hai, magar asafalata kaa tamgaa sar par liye huye
 They have to do this as a punishment and not as an obsession
 bhartiya yuvaaon kaa ek bada hissaa isi dishaheenata se grasit he
 Enterprise-led development can be a way that not only these youth will get direction, but we will also be able to use the unlimited power of these youths for development
 is kaa arth he ki aap aisa kuch karen ki aapaki kamai bhi ho or aap koi bady samasya kaa bhi samaadhaan kar paa rahe hon
 This means setting up enterprises that will participate in social or economic development, increase employment opportunities and develop an environment of economic security

 Logotherapy has given it the name of existential frustration
 The word 'existence' can be used in three ways
 The basis of life
 The meaning of existence, the pursuit of concrete meaning in personal existence
 This frustration can also result in neurosis
 Victor E
 Frankel dies They raise a very big question through the suffering of people, which has become the cause of everyone's weakness in today's life, that is the migration of meaninglessness in life
 Such suffering is seen mostly in those who escaped from the death camp
 There was no eagerness to live
 There was hollowness in their mind because they go through internal loneliness
 Victor E
 Frankl gave him the name of existence existence

 Frankel says that the real meaning of life is its own Not in the psyche but in the world
 In the same way, the real purpose of human existence is not through self-introduction
 Its essence comes from self-excellence
 Frankel Number thing that self-introduction arguments bring it to perfect justice could ever become the basis of life, as human as will try to get him as he lost i sansar ko swayan ki abhivyakti kabhi nahin samajhnaa chahie, naa hi sansar ko ek maatr saadhan yaah aatm parichay ko praapt karne kaa upaychiisse yahi aashay spasht hota hai ki jivan kaa arth sthir nahin he, par iskaa koi chor bhi nahin handi logotherapy ke antargat ham jivan ke arth teen tareeke se dhund sakate hai: karm ke madhyam se; kisi ke yaah kisi vaastu ke mulya ko anubhav karke; pidaa sekhi pehle tareeke ko purna karnaa atyant laabhadaayak haii dusre or tisare tareeko main punah vistaar ki aavashyaktaa handidusraa tarika jisase jivan main arth kaa pravesh hota hai wo anubhavon se hi praapt hota hai, yah shiksha hamen prakruti se ho sakati hai yaa phir samskruti se yaa phir kisi ko anubhav karke bhi yani prem ke dwarai prem hi vah ek dhaal hai jisase manushya ke antaratmik vyaktitv ko sinchaa ja saktaa handi koi bhi kisi manushya ko tab tak nahin jaan saktaa yaa samaj saktaa jab tak prem bhav ki utpatti nahin hotiji prem ko aadhyatmik rup ke anusaar agar daalaa jaae to usase vah dusre manushya ke mahatvapurn lakshan ko dekh saktaa hai, vahi manushya jisase vah prem karata hoi isse bhi adhik vah apane samarthy ki pushti ho jaati he jo aatm parichay ke raah par bahut bada kadam haii isse donon vyakti apane samarthy ko pahchaan jate handi The third way that helps a man discover the meaning of his life is suffering
 Whenever a man is helpless or goes through a situation that does not result in his hand such as: an incurable disease, then a person realizes his identity
 There is a lot of opportunity to do it, that is, you have the opportunity to get the biggest meaning of life by facing the pain
 In this, the attitude of the person towards the suffering is also strong to withstand the suffering

 The Shatabdi Express was the result of the thinking of the then Railway Minister Shri Madhavrao Scindia
 pehali shatabdi express ko nai dilli se jhaansi ke bich shuru kiya gaya tha jise baad me badhaakar bhopal tak kar diya gaya

 Indian Railways later introduced an air-conditioned and low-fare version of the Shatabdi Express known as Jan Shatabdi
 jab yah bharat main 1988 main shuru kii gai thi us samay is train ko ek bady uplabdhi mana jaataa tha
 It also had to suffer heavy criticism by a section of the society, according to them, in a poor country like India, there was no need for these luxury cars
 lekin, samay bitne ke saath, is train kaa str vilasita or gati ke vishwa maanakon ke hisaab se kaaphi neeche tak gir gaya he

 gurutvkarshan ek padaarth dwaara ek duusare kii ore aakrisht hone kii pravriti he
 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct
 unhone gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance

 gas, bhaap or jal se jalanevaale tarabine ek duusare se bhinn hote hai
 a gas compressor or pump is also similar to a turbine but it works opposite the turbine
 tarabine main kam se kam ek roter asembli hoti he jo iskaa gatiman poorja ek yaa ek se adhik bladon ke saath shaft yaa drum ke saath is mashin ko chalaata he
 The fluid or other material exerts pressure on the blade causing the rotor or rotational to move

 This is how the propeller of the turbine works
 propeller main laga spindal hawa yaa pani par dabaav banaata he
 This pressure causes the propeller to push the turbine backwards, causing it to move
 aamtaur par tarabine ko ek jagah rakh diya jaataa he, taaki jab bhi pani usase hokar gujarey to tarabine ke har blade par padane vaale dabaav se vah chal pade
 hawa yaa pani ke tarabine ke saath ek hi niyam lagu hota he
 The higher the water or air flow, the faster the turbine will run
 kaaryakari drav main dabaav urja or gatij urja shaamil hai
 Fluid can be compressed or uncompressed
 kai bhautik siddhanton ke aropan dwaara terbinon ko is urja ko ikattha karne ke liye niojit kiya jaataa he
 In impulse turbines the flow of high velocity liquid or gas jets is used to change the direction of the rotor blades
 parinamswaroop aaveg tarabine gumti he or gas yaa drav dhimi gati se baahar nikal jaataa he
 Various definitions of this term are given
 vistrut paribhaasha ke anusaar gas tarabine vah mul chaalak he jiske sampurna ushmiya chakra main kaaryakari taral gasiy avasthaa main hi bana rahata he evam jiske sabhi yantrangon kii gati paribhrami hoti he
 According to the narrow definition, the term is used only for the main turbine organ whose medium is hot air
 kuch vidwaanon ke matanusaar gas tarabine vah yantra he jisamen pravaah prakram avirat rahata he evam shakti tarabine dwaara praapt hoti he
 Those are the basic driving devices that convert the potential energy contained in water into mechanical work
 panchakkiyaan vibhinn prakaar se banaai jane par bhi badi hi saral prakaar kii yuktiyaan hai, jinka prayog pragaitihaasik kaal se hi shakti utpaadan karne ke liye hota chalaa aayaa he
 Inspired by the requirements and circumstances from time to time, people made many improvements in them, so water turbine is also an evolved form of watermill
 pichhali ardhshatabdi se to inkaa itnaa upyog bad gaya he ki inke dwaara lagbhag sabhi sabhy deshon main jagah jagah, chote bade anek jal-vidyutakti-grih banaae jane lage
 Due to this, electricity started to be received at a very cheap price even in remote waterless villages and the development of various types of industrial businesses was encouraged
 bhaap tarabine ek mulchaalak he, jisamen bhaap kii ushma-urja ko gatij urja main parivartit kar, ucch gatisheel bhaap ko ek ghurnak par bandhe hue bahut se falkon par takaraayaa jaataa he, jisase falak paribhraman karte hai evam isse kaary hota he
 In a reciprocating steam engine, the piston is acted upon by the static pressure of the steam
 yadhyapi ingine main bhaap piston ke saath chalati he, phir bhi ingine kii kriya main bhaap kii gatij urja kaa prabhaav naganay he
 Steam turbines can have higher speeds than steam engines and the speed can be larger
 tarabine ke purjon kaa santulan acha rahata he
 The same amount of steam and the same state of steam turbine can produce more power than a steam engine
 bhaap ingine se kuch varsh kaam lene ke baad bhaap kii khapat bad jaati he, parantu tarabine main aisi avasthaa nahin aati prithvi par ke sabhi mul chaalkon main bhaap tarabine sabase adhik tikaoo hota he
 The biggest advantage of a turbine is that it provides the rotor speed directly, while the steam engine has to handle separate materials to achieve rotational speed
 vaashpitra main bhaap kaa janan ucch daab evam adhitaap par hota he
 When this steam approaches the turbine, it has a high amount of heat energy and its pressure is so high that it can circulate to low pressure
 parantu us samay isaki gatij urja naganya hoti he
 Therefore, before steam can do some work, its heat energy is converted into kinetic energy
 yah parivartan, acchhee tarah abhikalpit upkaran main, bhaap ko vistaarit karne se hota he
 The diffusion of steam is accomplished either in a single action, or in different actions
 iskaa arth yah hota he ki ushma urja ko gatij urja main parivartit karne ke liye bahut se sthir upkaran vyavhaar main laae jate hai or praaia: do sthir upkarnon ke bich ek gatiman upkaran laga rahata he
 The kinetic energy received in the stationary device is then applied to work on the bonded moving device

 An article is found on this column, according to which a Greek Vidisha named Heliodorus came from Taxila
 vah vaishnav matavalambi tha or is stambh kaa nirmaan usee ne karaayaa tha
 This article is very important from a cultural point of view
 yah is baat kaa parichaayak he ki videshiyon ne bhi bhartiya dharm or samskruti ko apana liya tha
 People from other parts must have come to Vidisha in a similar way

 is adhinium ko multah agast 1935 main paarit kiya gaya tha or ise us samay ke adhiniyamit sansad kaa sabase lanbaa adhinium kaha jaataa tha
 Because of its length, the Government of India Act 1935 was divided into two separate Acts in response: bhartiya raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik itihaas par sahitya main sandarbh ko aamtaur par bharat sarkaar 1935 adhinium ko sankshipt rup mana jaataa he, bajaay adhinium ke paath ke rup main mul rup se adhiniyamit karne ke liye The most important aspects of the Act were: haalanki, swaittata kii degree prantiy str kii shuruuaat mahatvapurn simaaon ke adheen tha: prantiy governor mahatvapurn arakshit shaktiyon ko barkaraar rakhaa or british adhikariyon ne bhi ek jimmedaar sarkaar ko nilambit adhikaar banaae rakhaa
 The demand for parts of the Act was to establish the Union of India but never came into operation due to opposition from the rulers of the princely states
 jab adhinium ke tahat pehla chunaav kaa aayojan hua tab adhinium kaa shesh bhaag 1937 main lagu hua
 Since the second half of the nineteenth century, the Indian people have consistently demanded a greater role in the government of their country
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan british yuddh prayaason ke liye bharatiyon kaa yogadan karne kaa matlab tha ki british raajnneetik pratishthan ke adhik roodhiwaadee tatwon main sanvaidhanik parivartan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos karnaa or jiske parinamswaroop bharat sarkaar kaa 1919 adhinium
 is adhinium ne sarkaar ke ek nav pranali kii shuruuaat kii jise prantiy "dvishasan", ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, yani, kuch kshetron kii sarkaar ko prantiy vidhayika ke liye jimmedaar mantriyon ke haathon main rakhaa gaya jabaki anya ko british-niyukt prantiy governor ke liye jimmedaar adhikariyon ke haath main banaae rakhaa gaya
 While the Act was a reflection of the demand of Indians to play a larger role in government, it was also a reflection of British fears about what that role might mean in India's system
 dvishasan ke saath prayog asantoshjanak sabit hua
 a particular disappointment for Indian leaders was that in areas where they gained only nominal control, the "main authority" was in the hands of the British bureaucracy
 bharat kii sanvaidhanik vyavasthaaon kii samiksha kaa iraadaa kiya gaya tha or un rajasi rajyon jo ise sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar the
 However, a split between the Congress and the Muslim representatives proved to be the main factor to prevent the settlement as the system had significant knowledge of the Sangh's functioning
 vyavastha ke khilaaf, landan main nai kanjarvative prabhutv rashtriya sarkaar apane swayan ke prastaav ke masauda taiyaar karne ke saath aage aane kaa nirnay liya
 a joint parliamentary selection committee headed by Lord Linlithgow reviewed the White Paper to a great extent
 is white paper ke aadhaar par, bharat sarkaar ke bill kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Committee level and later bigotry was pacified, "security" strengthened and indirect elections for the Central Legislative Assembly were re-organized
 bill ko vidhivat agast 1935 main kanoon main paarit kiya gaya
 One consequence of this process is that, although the Government of India Act of 1935 should have gone a little further to meet Indian demands, both the expansion of the bill and the lack of Indian participation in its draft material meant that India The act proved to be radical for a significant element in Britain, while having the act with the best blunt response
 yadhyapi prastaavna ko shaamil karne ke liye british sansad ke adhiniyamon ke liye yah asaamaanya ho gai, bharat sarkaar ke adhinium 1935 se ek kii kami 1919 ke adhinium ke saath virodhabhas ho gai, jiske chalate bhartiya raajnneetik vikaas ke liye usase sambandhit us adhinium kaa uddeshy ke vyapak darshan ko sthapit kiya
 On 20 August 1917, the Preamble of the 1919 Act is quoted based on the statement of Edwin Montagu, Minister of India for the House of Commons, which promises: 


british samrajya ke ek abhinn hissaa ke rup main bharat main jimmedaar sarkaar kii pragatisheel prastuti ke liye ek darshan ke saath swayan-shaasi sanstha kaa dhire-dhaare vikaas he
 Indian demands with existing Dominions such as Canada and Australia now had to achieve constitutional parity in British India, which meant complete autonomy in the British Commonwealth
 british raajnneetik cirkil main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke kaaran shaq kiya ki bhartiya is aadhaar par unke desh ko chalaane main sakasham the or paryaapt "suraksha" ke saath, shaayad, kramik sanvaidhanik vikaas kii ek lambii avadhi ke baad ek uddeshy ke rup main dominian sthiti ko dekha
 This tension between them and the vision within the Indian and the British resulted in the clumsy agreement of the 1935 Act which had no preamble of its own, but the preamble of the 1919 Act replaced it, yet repealed the remnants of that act
 saamaanya rup se ise british se adhik mishrit sandeshon ke rup main bharat main dekha gaya, jo ki apane taraf se nirutsahi ravaiya ko sujhaati thi or bhartiya ichchhaaon ko santusht karne kii disha main "nunatam aavashyak" ke nikrushtatam drushtikon kaa suzav detii thi
 Unlike most modern constitutions, but common with Commonwealth constitutional law of the time, the Act did not incorporate the "bill of rights" within the new system that was intended to be established
 haalanki, bharat sangh ke prastaavit maamle main vahaan adhikaron ke ek set ko shaamil karne main kuch jatiltaayen thim, jaisaa ki nai ikai main nammaatr prabhutv rajasi rajyon shaamil the
 However a different view was considered by some and the draft outline constitution in the Nehru Report incorporated the bill's authority
 1947 main, adhinium main ek apekshaakrit kuch sanshodhano se bharat or pakistan ke antarim karyanvan samvidhan banaaya gaya
 The Act was not only extremely elaborate, but it was surrounded with a 'security standard', designed to enable the British Government to intervene whenever it was needed to maintain British responsibilities and interests
 is lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke sansthaanon kii dhire-dhire bad rahi he bhartiyakaran ke chehre main, adhinium upyog ke liye nirnay or british niyukt vysarai ke haathon main suraksha upayon kii vaastavik prashasan or prantiy governron jo bharat ke liye rajya sachiv ke niyantran ke adheen tha
 'the vast powers and responsibilities that the Governor General must discipline according to his discretion or his personal decision, it is clear that he is expected to be like Superman
 uske paas vinamrata, saahas or kadi mehnat ke liye ek anant kshamta ke saath sampann hona chahie "hamane is bill main kai suraksha upayon ko daalaa he" sar robert horn ne kaha 


 "lekin ve saare suraksha upaay ek hi vyakti ke bare main vichaar karti he or vah he visarai he
 He is the lynch-pin of the entire system

 "this speech reflects the vision of the staunch Torridge who was frightened one day by the possibility of the Viceroy being appointed by the Labor Government
 adhinium ko thik se padhane se se pataa chalata he ki british sarkaar ne ise apane liye taiyaar kiya he, jab bhi unhen mahasoos hoga tab ve kisi bhi samay kanoonee upkaran ke saath is par puraa niyantran le sakate the
 However, doing so without any precise reason would have eroded their credibility with groups of India whose aim was to achieve the Act
 kuch visham vichaar: "in the federal government 


 has presented a glimpse of responsible government
 lekin vaastaviktaa kaa abhaav he, maamle ke anusaar raksha or videshi maamalon main jaruri shaktiyon kii kami he, rajyapal general ko aavashyak taur mantri gatividhi ke liye seemaa pradaan kii gai he or bhartiya rajyon ke pratinidhitiv ke upaay ko nakaaratmak pradaan kiya gaya he or yahaan tak ki loktantric niyantran kii shuruyaat kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 It would be of great interest to see the development of the creation of a highly specialized government; Certainly, if it operates successfully, the most credit will go to the political ability of Indian leaders who have faced more serious difficulties than colonial politicians who developed a system of self-government that is now Dominion level
 i am on a climax

 It requires a fairly elaborate provision for the Viceroy to intervene if, in his appeal-disqualified view, any Indian law or act demands, or indeed, discrimination against, British subjects resident in Britain, British registered companies and, in particular, British Shipping interests

 In this form of compromise, the Foreign Secretary always consulted the Board of Trade and it was assumed that the Governor General would consult the Commerce Minister in India in a manner

 vahaan koi vaastavik satta ko centre main sammanit main nahin kiya gaya
 (report of Bulabhai Desai in the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform on 4 February 1935
 haalanki, udaaravaadi or congress main bhi tatv kunkunepan ke saath ise jane ke liye taiyaar the: "linlithgow asked Sapru whether he thought the scheme of Act 1935 was a satisfactory option
 sapru ne kaha ki unhen adhinium ko teji se lagu karnaa chahie or sangheey yojana usamen sannihit he
 This was not an ideal, but it is the only one at this stage
 


 kuch dinon ke baad sapru, vysarai se milane birla aayaa tha
 He thought that the Congress was moving towards the Sangh's acceptance
 birla ne kaha ki kendra ke liye raksha or videshi maamle ke aarakshan ke dwaara gandhi isse zyada chintit nahin the lekin rajyon ke pratinidhiyon ko chunane ke tareeke par dhyaan de rahe the
 Birla wanted the Viceroy to help Gandhi in choosing certain kings towards the democratic election of the delegates
 


 Then Birla said that this is the only chance of agreement between the government and Congress and discussion between Gandhi and Viceroy is the best hope
 " The British government sent Lord Linlithgow as the new Viceroy to bring the Act into effect
 linlithgo kaaphi budhimaan, behad mehnatee, eemaandaar, gambhir or is adhinium ko safal banane ke liye drudh sankalp tha, haalanki vah bhi niras, aavegahin, vidhi sammat tha or apane tatkaal cirkil ke baahar logon ke saath "sharton ko lagu karnaa" bahut mushkil mahasoos kiya
 In 1937, after a great deal of confrontation, provincial autonomy was introduced
 us bindu se 1939 main yuddh kii ghoshnaa tak, linlithgo ne lagaataar sangh kii shuruuaat karne ke liye raajaaon se sammilat hone kaa bharsak prayaas kiya
 In this he received very little support from the domestic government and the kings eventually rejected the Federation en masse
 sitambar 1939 main, linlithgo ne saamaanya rup se ghoshnaa kii ki bharat yuddh main germany ke saath gaya tha
 Although Linlithgow's behavior was constitutionally correct, it was quite offensive to Indian views
 iske chalate congress ke prantiy mantralayon ke saadhe istife kii ore agrasar hua jo bhartiya ekta ko kamjor kar diya
 From 1939, Linlithgow focused on supporting the war effort

 bhoomi sudhaar ke antargat bhoomi se sambandhit kanoonon tathaa prathaon main parivartan aate hai
 It is initiated by the government or run with the support of the government, which mainly focuses on the redistribution of agricultural land
 kulinvarg us saamaajik varg ko kaha jaataa he jiske sadasyon ko samaaj ke anya virgon kii tulana main adhik pratishtha, manyata or adhikaar die jaaen

 adhiktar samaajon main kulinvarg ke sadsy kulinwargi parivaar main janm lene ke aadhaar par swayan bhi kulinwargi ho jate hai
 There is further categorization within the elite, with some subclasses considered to be higher and some lower, although the entire elite is higher than all other classes
 kulinvarg kaa sarvocch sthaan shaasha kaa hota he, jaise ki samraat, maharani, vakairaah
 Modern republics such as India, the United States, and Sri Lanka generally do not have any officially-recognized elite, but are still found today in modern-day states such as the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia

 Historically, the polity of countries was often given membership in the nobility, rich in trade, mighty in war, or married to the nobility, or ordinary people who received the kindness of the rulers for any other reason, and then their children were born into this elite Were called members of iske vipareet yadi kulinvarg kaa koi sadsy shaskaon ko bura lage to unki oopaadhiyaan, dhan-sampatti yaa anya shakti chhinakar unhen kulinvarg se bedagal bhi kar diya jaataa tha

 ganit main jab koi raashi kaa maan kisi ek yaa ekaadhik raashiyon ke maan par nirbhar karata he to is sankalpana ko vyakt karne ke liye falan shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the amount of compound interest on a loan depends on the principal, time and rate of interest; Therefore, in the language of mathematics, we can say that compounding is a function of interest, principal, rate of interest and time
 spasht he ki kisi falan ke saath do prakaar kii rashiyaan sambandhit hoti hai - For a given value of variables, the function has one and only one value
 falan kii sankalpana, ganit kii sabase mul evam mahatvapurn sankalpanaaon main se ek he
 The concept of function did not develop abruptly, rather it developed slowly in some two hundred years and is still continuing
 do raashiyon kaa sambandh dikhaati ek suchi, ek sutara tathaa elgoridm aadi falan ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 The formal definition of the function is based on Cartesian multiplication so that there is no uncertainty or ambiguity
 do samucchyon x tathaa y kaa kartiya gunan sabhi kramit yugmon kaa samucchy he, jahaan x sadsy he x kaa, evam y sadsy he y kaa
 x and y are called 'components of ordered pair'
 x or y ke kartiya gunan ko x × y dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he
 The function f from x to y is a subset of the Cartesian product x × Y, provided the following conditions are followed
 duusare shabdon main x ke prayek avyav x ke liye keval ek avyav y aisa he ki kramit yugma falan f ko paribhaashit karne vaale upasamucchy kaa sadsy he
 Functions are represented in different ways
 inamen se kuch tareeke is prakaar hai: As a relation - as shown below the set of ordered pairs
 duusare falnon ke falan ke rup main Indira Gandhi National Open University is a Central University established in September 1985 by the Indian Parliamentary Act
 iskaa mukhya karyaalay nayi dilli main sthapit he
 It is the largest university in the world
 bharat or anya 33 deshon ke lagbhag 40 lakh vidhyaarthee isamen adhyayan karte hai
 The university is also the national resource center for free and distance learning in India and is the world's hero in distance education
 shikshan or anusandhan ke alaava, vistaar or prashikshan is vishvavidhyalay kii shaikshanik gatividhiyon kaa mukhya aadhaar he
