 jail main bhi gandhiji ko bhedbhaav se do chaar hona padaa kyonki angrejon ne bhartiya kaidiyon ke liye ek vishesh prakaar kii topi pahananaa jaruri kar diya tha
 Later, Gandhiji started wearing and circulating this cap forever so that people remember the discrimination happening to them
 This cap was later known as Gandhi Topi
 gandhiji jab bharat aae to unhone yah topi nahin balki pagadi pahani hui thi
 And after that he never even wore a turban or Gandhi cap, but Indian leaders and satyagrahis readily adopted this hat
 congress party ne is topi ko gandhiji ke saath joda or apane prachaarkon evam swayamsevakon ko ise pahanane ke liye protsaahit kiya
 Thus, due to political reasons, this cap has reached millions of people who did not wear any kind of hat
 bhartiya netaa or rajnatik dal is prakaar kii topi ke alag alag praaroop istemaal karte the
 Subhash Chandra Bose wore khaki colors while Hindu Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers wore black caps
 aaj bhi is topi kii praasangikta bani hui he
 While the Indian National Congress is still adopting it, Samajwadi Party workers wear red Gandhi hats

 The set of gross works related to dictionary formation is called koshakarma or lexicography
 vishyon kii drushti se shabdkoshon ke varg yaa vibhaag bananaa kathin he
 Different Kokhars used to create such subjects according to their understanding
 unka na to koi nishchit kram hota tha or na ho hi saktaa tha
 So people often had to memorize the entire dictionary
 isi kaaran paashchaatya deshon main shabdkosh aksharkram se banane lage
 There was no need to rote such a dictionary and he could use it as and when required
 aajkal praaia: sabhi deshon or sabhi bhashaaon main kosh ke kshetra me isi kram ko prayog hone laga he : jo jigyaasu kii drushti se sabase adhik subhite kaa hota hai
 That's why alphabet is often used in all types of thesaurus
 yon to kosh ke anek prakaar hote hai, par arth ke vichaar se ve do bhaagon main baante ja sakate hai
 One is those in which meanings and interpretations of the words of a language are in the same language and other in which the meanings of the words of one language are given in another language or languages
 vishay ke vichaar se kosh anek prakaar ke ho sakate hai, jaise-ganit kosh, vidhik kosh, vaidyak kosh, sahitya kosh aadi
 Such dictionaries are often counted in terms such as agricultural terminology, philosophical terminology, geographical terminology etc
 inke sivaa kuch vishisht kaviyon, boliyon aadi ke bhi alag alag kosh hote hai, jaise-tulsi kosh, sur kosh, avadhi kosh, brajabhasha kosh aadi
 The main symbols, topics or words that contain thesaurus or tables in important texts of a particular subject are called successive metaphorical index, subject index or concordance
 koshrachana ek kala he
 Knowledge of this art can be obtained by studying the dictionaries of the most advanced languages of the present era with a subtle view
 achche or pramanik koshon kaa sampadan tab tak keval vidwata ke bal par nahin ho saktaa, jab tak koshrachana kii kala kaa bhi puraa puraa gyaan na ho or is kala kaa gyaan koshon ke jivanavyapee adhyayan se hi ho saktaa he
 All types of thesaurus are made only for the fulfillment of a particular purpose and the need of a particular area
 at: koshrachana main mukhyat: isi uddeshy yaa aavashyaktaa kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa hai
 Secondly, one has to keep in mind that his entire body is balanced in all respects; It is not that an organ grows more than it needs or justification, and someone seems to be weak or inferior in comparison
 shabdon kaa vivechan bhi or us vivechan ke angon kaa kram bhi sadaa ek sa rahanaa chahie
 Words also have castes or classes, so all the words of a caste or class should have the same interpretation
 yadi pramanik granthon athwa lekhakon ke udhaaharan liye jaae, to unka utana hi ansh lenaa chahie, jitne main aashay spasht ho sake or jigyaasu kaa samaadhaan ho jaae
 Good dictionaries also contain terminology for all types of fields and subjects
 isaliye sampadak kaa adhik se adhik vishyon kaa saamaanya gyaan yaa bodh hona chahie
 When needed, it is necessary to seek help from a good and authentic book of an unknown or new subject or even from a good writer
 koshrachana ke kaary main drushti bahut vyapak rakhana chahie or vritti madhukaari honi chahie
 The vision should be so sharp and subtle that it can easily make sense of Neer Ksheer and by finding old errors, faults, mistakes, etc
, it can be easily corrected and corrected
 koshkar main pakshpaat yaa rogadwesh naam ko bhi nahin rahanaa chahie
 Its sole purpose should be to serve language and literature
 koshon main pradhanta arthon or vivechanon kii hi hoti he, at: unamem kahin vyapti yaa ativyapti nahin rahani chahie
 All things should be brief, nappy and moderate as much as possible
 kosh main adhik se adhik or thos jaankaree kam se kam shabdon main prastut karke hi jaani chahie
 There is no place in the dictionary for unnecessary or recruitment matters
 shabdon ke kuch rup to maanak hote hai or bahut se rup sthanik yaa prantiy hote hai
 The spatial or provincial words of which the standard forms are received should be interpreted within the same standard words and their standard or provincial forms should be mere reference to their standard forms
 isse bahut bada laabh yah hota he ki anya bhashaa-bhashiyon ko sahaj main shabdon ke maanak rup kaa pataa chal jaataa he or bhashaa kaa maanak rup sthir hone main sahaayta milti he-aparichiton ke dwaara bhashaa kaa rup sahasaa bigadane nahin paata
 The same thing should be done with regard to Sanskrit words which have many synonyms
 jaise camel, nadi, parvat, samudr aadi
 While giving their synonyms in front of words, it should also be kept in mind that only those synonyms should be given the exact meaning or measure of the original word
 jin paryaayon ke kaaran kuch bhi bhram utpann ho saktaa ho, un paryaayon kaa aise prasangon main parityag karnaa hi shreyaskar hoga
 Recently, Webster's New World Dictionary has set a new model in front of lexicographers, which is very useful and useful for dictionaries, because they are very useful and useful
 usamen anek shabdon ke antargat unase milte julate paryaayon ke sookshm antar bhi dikhalaae gaye hai, yatha - feare ke antargat dred, friete, elarm, disme, teror or painic ke sookshm antar bhi batala die gaye hai
 It has been done in such a way that the work of the lexicon is not finished by conveying the meaning of the words, but even beyond this, its job is to tell people the correct use of the words
 hamaare yahan aise saikadon hajaaron shabd milenge, jinke parsparik sookshm antar batalaaye ja sakate hai or is prakaar jigyaasuon ko shabdon par nae dhang se vichaar karne kaa abhyaas karaayaa ja saktaa he
 There is another new and useful practice in recent good and big English dictionaries, which can be particularly useful for Indian language dictionaries
 praaia: sabhi bhashaaon main bahut se aise yogic shabd hote hai jo upsarg lagaakar bana liye jate hai
 Junior to Junior, Causal to Indeterminate, Expected to Unexpected, Necessary to Unnecessary, Minister to Deputy Minister, Committee to Subcommittee, Adherence to Compliance, Excursion from Cruise, Reaction to Karma, Legislation from Legislation etc
 upsargon ke yoga se bananevaale aise shabdon kii sankhya bahut adhik hoti he
 Such words are divided into two classes or can be divided
 ek to aise shabd jinke shabd purv pad tathaa uttar pad mil kar bhi kisi nae yaa vishisht arth se yukt nahin hote or isi liye saadhaaran shabdon ke antargat rahete hai
 Such words and their meanings greatly increase the level of the dictionary
 is prakaar ke vyarth vistaar se bachane ke liye webster ke nae koshon main yah nai paddati apanaai gai he ki unhen swatantra shabd nahin maanate or isi liye unke arth bhi nahin liye gaye hai
 At the end of the page, a list of such words is given below a line, as-un-destined, un-disturbed, un-free, un-hurt, un-invoked etc
 haan, inke vipareet duusare varg ke kuch aise shabd avashya hote hai jinamein upsargon ke yoga se kuch nae arth nikalate hai
 As in the adjective form, the form of Achcha is hairless, but in noun form it is also a name for the planet Ketu
 anagaar kaa arth bina ghar-barwaala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah sanyasi kaa bhi vaachak he
 Therefore it is necessary to take such words
 jin shabdon ke arth purvpad or utaarpad ke yoga se swat: nasht ho jate hon, unhen koshon main arthsahit lenaa vyarth hi samajha jane laga he
 Therefore, it would be sufficient to just give a list of such words in the page
 haan, jin yogic shabdon main donon padon ke yoga se koi nayaa or vishesh arth nikalataa ho, unhen yathasthaan arthsahit lenaa to aavashyak he hi
 The method of our old Sanskrit dictionary has been that the words formed by the sum of ati, prati, etc
 are given together under the same title under their former term
 hindi ke kuch koshon ne bhi is pratha kaa anukaran kiya he
 Although this method is rational from the point of view of Sanskrit grammar, even in Sanskrit dictionaries, it does not appear to be fully followed
 isamen sthaan kii kuch bachat avashya hoti he, par asaadhaaran pathakon ke liye shabd dhoondhna bahut kathin ho jaataa he
 Sometimes it is difficult to find words from this method even for people who are very familiar with its rules and principles
 prayek bhashaa main kuch shabd aise hote hai jo alag alag arthon ke vichaar se avyay, kriyavisheshan, visheshan, pratyay sangya aadi bhi hote hai or alag alag mulon se bhi vyutpann hote hen, yatha hindi ko aan shabd sangya bhi he, visheshan bhi or pratyay bhi
 In its noun form, it is derived from a few different origins in many of its meanings
 aise shabd aadhunik or shreshth angareji koshon main alag or swatantra shabd maane jate hai or unke alag alag sheershak rakhkar unka vivechan kiya jaataa he, yatha-angareji main waayiz visheshan bhi he, sangya bhi or pratyay bhi or teenon roopon main uske sheershak alag alag rakhe gaye hai
 If they are also followed in the lexicons of Indian languages, it will be very good in many respects

 Along with this, there is a rebuttal of Christianity, Islam and many other texts and beliefs

 Keeping this in mind, Maharishi Dayanand named it Satyartha Prakash, which sheds light on the true meaning

 Although Hindu life takes place before both the individual and society, it is often seen among Hindus that there is more individualistic tendency than collectivist

 The axis is between the two legs p1 and p2 of Dharuk
 dharuk kaa neeche kaa paat pa2 bandhani ke ardhgolakaar sthaan main baitha diya jaataa he
 The interpolation is placed to prevent this bridge from rotating
 is paat main dhuree ko rakhkar paat pa2 ko iske upar lagaakar topi t se argali dwaara kas diya jaataa he
 a hole is made in the upper part of the cap, giving oil or lubricant
 tel yaa snehak chhed chha main se hota hua bheetar dhuridhar main bane hue khaanchon main chalaa jaataa he or jab dhuree gumti he to snehak dhuree tathaa dharuk ke bich ek jhilli bana detaa he, jiske kaaran dhuree keval snehak kii is jhilli par hi gumti he
 Therefore, the wear of the torrent is very low and that too before the axle is fully occupied and at the time of its stop
 yadi snehak thik samay par diya jaataa rahe to dharuk bahut dinon tak chalata he
 The torrents of modern design are made differently
 kaarkaanon main, jahaan lambii dhuriyon par kai kai dharuk hote hai, dharukon ke aakalpan main iskaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki dhuree kaa sanrekhan khadi tathaa kshaitij disha main vyavasthaapi penchon se thik kiya ja sake
 The bottom of the holder of sharp and heavy axles contains an agar of oil or lubricant
 kuch dharukon main neeche ke bhaag main tel se bhare hue talp rahete hai
 These talp live between the axis and the dhruk and from the talpa a light goes through the hole into the oil well
 isi batti ke dwaara talp ko har samay tel miltaa rahata he
 There are two methods of sending oil between the torrents, by gravity or by pressure
 yah tel bheetar jaakar dhuree ke ghoomane par jo jhilli banaata he uske mahattam nipid kaa sthaan dhuree kii raftaar, bhaar or iske ghoomane kii disha par nirbhar he
 If the load is applied on the horizontal axis, which is moving in the counterclockwise direction, the center of maximum pressure will be found on the right side of the middle vertical line at an angle of 10 ° to 45 ° and this angle will be based on the value of load and speed
 kam gati or adhik bhaar ke kaaran mahattam daab kaa centre lagbhag dharuk ke pende main hoga
 The area of minimum pressure will be to the right of the vertical line at the top for this axis
 yadi dhuree ke ghoomane kii disha badal di jaae to mahattam tathaa nunatam daab ke vindu usee kone par khadi centre rekha ke bai ore honge
 For holders in which oil is entrapped, the oil should go in place of minimum pressure
 yadi mukhya bering par bhaar he to dharukon ke upree bhaag dwaara tel dene se bhi kaam chal jaataa he
 Where oil is given by pressure, it would be better to send oil from near the place of maximum pressure
 is sthaan ko usee disha main hona chahie jis ore dhuree gum rahi he
 Except for small holders, grooves are made in all other holders, due to which the oil is spread uniformly at all places
 ye khaanche tel ke nipid ke sthanon par nahin banaae jate, kyonki in sthanon par khaanche tel ko kam gharshan ke sthanon kii ore jane kaa avasar denge or tel kii jhilli thik prakaar nahin ban paaegi
 The main bearings or journals do not have grooves, but are only made in the torrents, but the grooves that move in the direction of rotation of the spindle are more profitable than the location of the oil
 thik prakaar tel die gaye dharuk kaa gharshan gunank, thr, tel ke lakshan par nirbhar he
 The effect of the metal of the torrent is above the coefficient of friction, it depends on the properties of the spindle and the formation of oil membranes and the spindle stop or lubricant
 maan len, tel kii thik jhilli ban gai he to sangharsh gunank tel, taap, gati or bhaar par aadhrut he
 The coefficient of friction is 0
005 or 0
002 for good lubricants and 0
05 or more for bad lubricants
 un sthanon par bina tel ke dharukon kaa upyog bhi hota he, jahaan yah dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki tel girane se mashin se bananevaale maal main kharabi na aa jaae, jaise kapadaa banaanevaali mashine
 If these machines have oily torrents, then the oil will fall on the cloth, which will spoil the cloth
 at: ye dharuk vividh prakaar ke hote hai
 In one stream, oil-soaked wood is applied, in the second, the part of brass is made of graphite, due to which the friction is greatly reduced
 isi prakaar or duusare dharuk bhi banaae jate hai, jinamein tel kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Some speculators think that the diameter of the journal should be kept to a minimum, taking into account the power of the spindle, which causes minimal wear
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki yadi dhuree kii gati adhik rakhni he to isapar bhaar bhi kam hi hona chahie
 But in modern assessors, it has been established that if the torrent is designed properly, then it can be put more weight along with the speed
 isse koi haani nahin hogi
 It has also been proved that reducing the length of the torch has more benefits, especially for the axis of high speed
 kam lambey dharukon main jhukaav nahin hoga
 Due to this the nipid will be equal at every place within Dharuk
 isliye dharuk kii lambaai uske vyas se kam rakhane se dhuree kii chaal bhi zyada kii ja sakati he or dhuree par bhaar bhi zyada daalaa ja saktaa he
 It should be noted that if the length of the bends is reduced more then the nipple within it will increase, which can cause a tightness in the axis and if the length is longer then the tilting in the talus can be created
 isliye dharuk kii lambaai tathaa vyas kaa anupaat aisa rakhana chahie jinase na to jhukaav kaa dar ho or na ghuri hi jakad sake
 For this reason this ratio is kept 1: 1
5 for the axle of the ship, 1
2: 2
5 for the installed engines, 2: 3 and 3: 4 for the simple heavy axle
 dharuk kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Each of them has different usage: khadi dhuree ke liye kilak dharuk banaaya jaataa he
 There is a band called "V", which is tightened in the machine
 is bandhani main pital kaa dharuk he, jisamen dhuree ko lagaaya jaataa hai
 The entire weight of the axle remains at the base of the torso
 isko ardhgolakaar banaaya jaataa he or isi bhaag main tel yaa snehak rahata he
 As a result of an examination, it has been found that if a groove is filled in the base of this torrent and oil is filled in it, then when the spindle moves, the oil moves upwards and exits through the axis
 yadi is baahar nikle hae tel ko phir se bheetar bhej diya jaae to is tel kaa upyog baar baar ho saktaa he or dharuk ke bheetar kabhi tel khatam nahin hoga
 Increasing the load on this type of axle will cause more pressure on the rivet, which may cause the torrent to fail
 isliye is prakaar ke dharuk par 15 kilogram prati varg centimetre se adhik daab nahi daali jaati
 Galpatta dharuk is used at higher pressures
 is prakaar ke dharukon kaa upyog un sthanon par hota he jahaan dhuree par adhik bhaar ho
 The brass of this torch is in two parts, in which the grooves are made according to the positions of the axles
 in khaanchon main dhuree ke padon ko baithaaya jaataa he or yah sanyukt ang bandhani main utaar diya jaataa he
 In this way, each position works differently and the axle load is divided in these positions
 in dharukon ko jal dwaara thanda rakhaa jaataa he
 If these fluids are kept properly and oil is also given at the right time, then they can tolerate more movement and pressure and can last for more days
 abhi tak jo dharuk bataae gaye hai unamem dhuree kaa tal dharuk ke tal par ghumta rahata he or sarpi gharshan ke kaaran donon kii dhaatu ghisti rahati hai
 To reduce this friction, cylinders or bullets are seated between the rotating soles
 is prakaar donon tal belanon par ghoomte hai or sarpi gharshan ke sthaan par belan gharshan kaam karata he, jiske kaaran taapan tathaa ghisaai bahut kam ho jaati he, parantu in dharukon ke ghis jane par duusare dharukon ke samaan inkaa vyavasthaapan nahin kiya ja saktaa, balki inako badalanaa hi padataa he
 These torrents are very strong and also provide more speed due to less friction
 goli gharuk bhi isi ke sadrush banaaya jaataa he
 Its tablets remain between the two arms
 antar keval yahi he ki goli dharuk main bhaar vinduon par hota he or belan dharuk main bhaar rekhaon par hota he
 Therefore, the weight should not be so high that the arms should be stacked or fabricated
 belan tathaa goli or baaju sab kathor ispaat ke bane hote hai
 All cylinders or bullets of a torrent need to be of the same size, otherwise a bullet of larger magnitude will carry more weight and the torrent will fail
 upar likhi gai baton se pataa chalegaa ki kisi dharuk ke thik kaam karne ke liye tel jaruri cheez he
 This oil forms a light membrane between the journal and the torrent, due to which the two metals cannot meet each other and the journal rotates on this membrane
 yadi kisi kaaran se dharuk main tel kam ho jaataa he to yah tel kii jhilli tut jaati he or jarnal kii dhaatu dharuk kii dhaatu se ragad khaane lagati he, jisase dharuk tathaa jarnal adhik garam ho jate hai
 This heating expands both metals and Dharuk grips the journal
 mashin kaa jarnal aisa bhaag he jisaki laagat dharuk se adhik hoti he or isaki kharaab hone se bachaaya jaataa he
 To save the same, white metal is filled in the grooves of Dharuk by making them
 jab kisi kaaran se dharuk tapakar jakadane lagati he tab yah dhaatu pighalkar jarnal or dharuk ke bich chalaa aata he or puri dhuree ruk jaati he
 Therefore, to move around with less heat and friction without a journal it is necessary to keep in mind two things: dharuk main gharshan ho to shaft kii kuch shakti dharuk main nasht hoti rahati he or upyogi kaary kii maatra kuch kam ho jaati he

 It is heard that when young Sawai Jaisingh first appeared in the court of Delhi Emperor Aurangzeb, it is not known why Aurangzeb suddenly grabbed both the hands of Jaisingh and asked "now tell me, what will you do?" At this, Jai Singh smiled directly at the lips and said with a very calm voice, "alampanah! We have a tradition of marriage among Hindus
" var, vadhoo kaa ek haath apane haath main lekar is baat kii pratigya karata he ki vah uskaa haath jindagi bhar nahi chhodega, umr bhar uskaa saath nibaahega! aaj badshaah salaamat khud meraa ek haath nahin, mere donon hi haath jab apane haath main le chuke hai, fir mujhe kis baat kii parvaah?" aurangzeb ko is chaturaai bhare jabaab kii ummid na thi, lekin is budhimattapurna haazirajavaabi se vah bahut prasann hua
 , yadunath sarkaar ne apane jaipur itihaas main is 'oopaadhi' ke bare main jo shabd likhe hai- avikal rup se ye hai-" The new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased with this youthful prince's feats before Khelna that he cried out," You are more than a man, you are sawa- i
e
,a hundred and twenty five per cent hero' Some other sources state that the title of 'sawai' was not given by Aurangzeb but by Emperor Farrukh Sayar

 Jaisingh II was born Margashirsha Vadi on 7 November 1745, on 3 November 1688 from Raja Vishnusingh's Rathore Queen, Indrakanwar, daughter of Thakur Keshari Singh of Kharwa in Ajmer

 The news of Bishan Singh's death in Kabul reached the royal camp of Maharashtra on 18 February 1700, usually one and a half months after his death, then two days later, the emperor Aurangzeb changed the name of his eldest son from Vijay Singh to Jai Singh, Accepted the heir to the throne of Amer
 badshaah ne jaisingh ke chote bhai cheema ji kaa naam vijaisingh rakhaa
 According to Yadunath Sarkar "


 Jai Singh remained in Amer since his return from the south in July 1698, when the emperor also sent a number of 'strict calls' to attend him
 From his father's time, the delhi-emperor
 They wanted to call them in the south to take their military service
 parantu raja vishnusingh apane putr ko dakshin main nahin bhejnaa chaahate the
 But in 1698, he went to Maharashtra on the pressure of the emperor
 aath maheene mogul shivi main rah kar ye vaapis apni rajdhani amer laut aaye
 Immediately after sitting on the throne, as noted above, he was called in November 1700 to fight with his army in the south as an army of Mughal emperors, but somehow Jaising continued to evade
 vah jab kai shahi-adeshon kii avhelnaa kar chuke, to antat inhen 'jabaran' le aane ko badshaah ne kuch harkare amer tak bhi bheje| inaki anupasthiti se naaraaz badshaah aurangzeb ne in se amer raja kaa khitaab to nahin chhina, par 13 sitambar 1701 ko inhen 'padaavnat' karte hue maatr 500 jaat, 100 savaar kaa maamuli manasabadaar bana diya
 He was appointed as his military aide for the protection of Panhala near Aurangzeb's grandson Shah Bidarbakht when he reached the south in October 1701, battling difficult routes and rain-blocked routes
 aurangzeb ke pote shah bidarbakht ke netritv main baadashahi sena ne 11 may i0 1702 ko khilanaa ke kile par baari hamalaa kiya
 In this Amer and Mughal combined forces suffered a lot of casualties, but by breaking its walls, the first Kachwaha army of Jai Singh entered the Blossom-fort

 On this blossom-conquest, King Aurangzeb raised his mansab to 2000, first after the request of Shah Bidarbakht

Meanwhile, in AD 1704, two Badshahi Faujdars took local help and snatched the fief from Thakur Kushal Singh Rajawat to the Jhilaiya hideout located in Sawai Madhopur on 13 November 1704

 • It should not be trivial litigation by persons having vested interests

 supreme court main: yadi ek janhit yachika supreme court main he, to main daayar kii he arthath yachika kaa set karne ke liye daayar kiya janaa he
 The opposite party is served copying only when the notice is issued bharat ke ucch nyaayalayon haalanki or vishesh rup se, supreme court baar gambhir saamaajik vaastaviktaaon ke prati samvedansheel ho gaya he or is avasar par atyaachaar karne ke liye diya raahat, garib ke liye khud kaa pratinidhitiv karne kii kshamta nahin he, yaa karne ke liye pragatisheel kanoon kaa laabh lene ke liye

 In the past, many people have tried the privilege of pill abuse and thus now the court generally requires a detailed explanation of the facts and complaint and then decides whether to issue notice and call the opposite party

 oinstin ke bauddhik uplabdhiyon or apurvata ne "oinstin" shabd ko "budhimaan" kaa paryaay bana diya he
 Albert Einstein was born in Germany into a Jewish family in Wüttemberg
 unke pita ek ejeeniyar or celsman the
 His mother was Pauline Einstein
 haalaanki oinstin ko shuru-shuru main bolne main kathinaayee hoti thi, lekin ve padhai main awwal the
 His mother tongue was German and later he also learned Italian and English
 1880 main unka parivaar munich shahar chalaa gaya, jahaan unke pita or chachaa ne milakar "electratechnic frabik je oinstin and si" naam kii company kholi, joki bijli ke upkaran banaati thi
 And it also provided lights for the first time at the Oktoberfest fair in Munich
 unka parivaar yahudee dharmik paramparaon ko nahin maanata tha, or isi vajah se oinstin catholic vidhyalay main padhne ja sake
 He learned to play Sarangi at the behest of his mother
 unhen ye pasand nahin tha or baad me ise chhod bhi diya, lekin baad me unhe mozart ke sarangi sangeet me bahut anand aata tha
 In 1894, his father's company could not get a contract to supply for electric lighting in the city of Munich
 jiske kaaran huye nuksaan se unhen apni company bechni pad gai
 In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, where they first settled in Milan and then a few months later in the city of Pavia
 parivaar ke pavia jane ke baad bhi oinstin munich main hi apni padhai puri karne ke liye ruke rahen
 In late December 1894, he traveled to Italy to visit his family in Pavia
 italy main apane samay ke dauraan unhone "ek chumbakeey kshetra main ether kii avasthaa kii jaanch" sheershak ke saath ek laghu niabandh likhaa tha
 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "
 ve khud ke kaam ke alaava duusare vaigyanikon ke saath bhi sahyog karte the, jiname bose oinstin ke aankade, oinstin refricrator or anya kai aadi shaamil hai
 
 anus mirabilis papers chaar lekhon se sambandhit hai jise oinstin ne 1905 ko onlan der physic naam kii ek vaigyanik patrika main prakashit kiya tha, jiname prakashavidyut prabhaav, brounian gati, vishesh saapekshatawaad, or e = mc2 shaamil the
 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means
 yahi patr, 1905 ke brounian gati par shodh-patr ke liye neenv bane, jisamen pataa chalaa ki anuo kii upasthiti hetu brounian gati ko thos saboot kii tarah upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena
 unhone saapekshata ke siddhant ko vyakt kiya
 Which, according to Herman Minkowski, is known for the generalization of alternation alternately from space to space-time
 anya siddhant jo oinstin dwaara banaaye gaye or baad main sahi sabit hue, main samanta ke siddhant or kwantum sankhya ke samoshna samanyikaran ke siddhant shaamil the
 Einstein's paper "on the dynamics of electricity of moving bodies" was completed on 30 June 1905 and published on 26 September of the same year
 yah bijli or chumbakatv ke maxwell ke sameekaran or yantriki ke siddhanth, prakaash kii gati ke kareeb yantriki main bade badlaav ke baad, ke bich saamanjasy nishchit karata hai
 This was later known as Einstein's special theory of relativity
 jiskaa nishkarsh tha ki, samay- antariksh dhaanche main gatisheel padaarth, dhimaa or sankuchit najar aata hai, jab ise paryvekshak ke dhaanche main mapa jaataa he
 This paper also argued that the idea of luminiferous ether was excessive
 dravyaman-urja samatulyata ke apane shodh-patr main, oinstin ne vishesh saapekshata samikarnon se E=mc2 ko nirmit kiya
 Since 1905 Einstein's research in relativity remained controversial for many years, although it was also accepted by many leading physicists such as Max Planck
 1905 ke ek patr main, oinstin bataaya kii ki prakaash swatah hi sthaneey kanon ke bane hote hai
 Einstein's light quanta hypothesis was rejected by almost all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Burr
 robert millican kii prakashavidyut prabhaav par vistrut prayog, tathaa compton bikharane kii maap ke saath, yah pariklpana saarvbhaumik rup se 1919 main sweekaar kar liya gaya
 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat
 Can solve the problem
 peter dibai ne is model ko parishkrut kiya
 During the 1910s, it expanded to bring individual systems within the realm of quantum mechanics
 arnest radarford ke nabhik kii khoj, or yah prastaav ke baad ki electron, grahon kii tarah kaksha main ghoomte hai, niles bohr yah dikhaane main sakasham hue kii plank dwaara shuru or oinstin dwaara viksit kwantum yantric ke dwaara tatwon ke parmaanuon main electronon kii asatat gati or tatwon kii aavart sarini ko samajhaayaa ja saktaa hai
 Einstein contributed to its development by combining the logic of 1898 with Wilhelm Vienna
 viena ne yah dikhaaya ki, ek thermal santulan avasthaa ke sthiroshm parivartanheenata kii pariklpana se alag-alag taapmaana par sabhi kaale ghumaav ko ek saral sthanantaran prakriya ke dwaara ek duusare se vyutpann kiya ja saktaa he
 In 1911, Einstein found that the same temperate theory shows that the quantity that is quantized in any mechanical motion must be a stabilizing invariant
 arnald samarfield ne samoshna aparivartaneey ko paaramparik yantriki main gatisheel char ke rup main pahchaan kii
 According to this theory- albert oinstin kaa is vishay main bahut bada yogadan rahaa he
 While traveling, Einstein wrote letters to his wife Elsa and adopted daughter Kadamuni Margot and Ilse
 ye patr, da hebrew uniwarsity main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Margot Einstein had allowed these private letters to be made available to the public, but at the same time requested that they not be done until twenty years after his death

 Du Bois, and agreed to testify on his behalf during one of his trial in 1951
 jab oinstin ne du bois ke charitra ke liye gavaah hone kii peshkash kii, to nyaayadhish ne mukademe ko kaarij karne kaa faisla kiya
 In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historic black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree
 oinstin ne america main naslwad ke bare main bhaashan diya, unka kahana tha, "meraa iske bare main chup rahane kaa koi iraadaa nahin hai
 "A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had ever paid college education fees for black students
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh se purv, ek akhbaar ne apane ek kollam main ek sankshipt vivaran prakashit kiya kii oinstin ko america main itani acchhee tarah se janaa jaataa tha ki log unhen sadak par roak kar unke die siddhant kii vyakhya poochne lagate the
 Eventually he figured out a way to avoid this constant questioning
 ve unase kehete kii "maaf kijiye! mujhe log aksar professor oinstin samajhate hai par wo main nahin hoon
 "einstein has been the subject or inspiration of many novels, films, plays and musicals

 Frederick Golden of Time magazine once wrote that Einstein was "like a cartoonist's dream coming true"
 oinstin ne kai puraskaar or sammaan praapt kiye or 1922 main unhen bhautikee main "saidhantik bhautikee ke liye apni sevaaon, or visheshkar prakashvaidhut prabhaav kii khoj ke liye" nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 If no nomination in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, then the award of 1921 went ahead and Einstein was awarded it in 1922

 Chhattisgarh and China have had friendly relations not only in trade but also in terms of art, culture and religion
 chhattisgarh main buddha dharm kii samrudh parampara or uske puraatatv ke pracheen avshesh is baat ke sakshi hai
 This connection is confirmed by a visit to Weiंगang
 wensang kii yatra kaa maarg chhattisgarh se hokar gujara or yah bataata he ki chhattisgarh se china tak paidal maarg tha jiske madhyam se anek buddha bhikshu dharm-prachaar ke liye yahan aate rahe hai

 in yatraaon main chini-yatri wensang bhi tha jisane chhattisgarh ko duniya ke itihaas ke pannon main apni jis yatra-vrutant ke madhyam se darj kar diya
 The brief but important benefit of the visit to Wei Ssang was that he willed Nagarjuna to South Kosala and South Kosal is the ancient name of Chhattisgarh
 wensang kaa asli naam yuvan changus tha
 a book titled Thomas Warts on Yuvan Chang's Travels in India was published on his journey
