 Today, the name of Geeta Press Gorakhpur is not unknown to any Indian
 sanathan hindu samskruti main aasthaa rakhane vaala duniya main shaayad hi koi aisa parivaar hoga jo gita press gorakhpur ke naam se parichit nahin hoga
 From the Ramayana, Gita, Vedas, Puranas and Upanishads in this country and in every corner of the world, the only credit for delivering the stories of the sages and sages of ancient India is to Bhaiji Ji Hanuman Prasad Poddar, the founder of Gita Press Gorakhpur
 prachaar-prasar se dur rahakar ek akinchan sevak or nishkaam karmyogi kii tarah bhayeeji ne hindu samskruti kii manyataon ko ghar-ghar tak pahunchaane main jo yogadan diya he, itihaas main uski misaal milanaa hi mushkil he
 According to the Indian calendar, he was born on the day of Pradosh of Ashwin Krishna in the year 1949 of Vikram Samvat
 is varsh yah tithi shanivaar, 6 oktober ko he
 In Ratangarh, Rajasthan, Lala was a devotee of Bhimraj Agarwal and his wife Rikhibai Hanuman, so he named his son Hanuman Prasad
 do varsh kii aayu main hi inaki mata kaa swargvaas ho jane par inkaa paalan-poshan daadi maan ne kiya
 Amid the religious rites of the grandmother, the child Hanuman got to read and listen to the stories of the Gita, Ramayana Vedas, Upanishads and Puranas from childhood
 in sanskaron kaa balak par gaharaa asar padaa
 In his childhood he was taught the lesson of Hanuman Kavach
 nimbark sampradaay ke sant brajadas ji ne balak ko diksha di
 At that time the country was held in chains of slavery
 inke pita apane kaarobaar kaa vajah se kalakatta main the or ye apane dadaji ke saath assam main
 In Calcutta, he came in contact with the revolutionaries of the freedom movement Arvind Ghosh, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, Pt Jhabarmal Sharma and jumped into the freedom movement
 iske baad lokmaanya tilak or gopalkrishna gokhale jab kalakatta aae to bhai ji unke sampark main aae iske baad unki mulaakaat gandhiji se hui
 Bhai Ji was very impressed with the 'swatantra Samar Granth of 1857' written by Veer Savarkar and in 1938 he came to Mumbai to meet Veer Savarkar
 1906 main unhone kapadon main gaay kii charbi ke prayog kiye jane ke khilaaf andolan chalaaya or videshi vastuon or videshi kapadon ke bahishkaar ke liye sangharsh ched diya
 He started using Khadi and indigenous items in his youth
 vikram samvath 1971 main jab mahaamanaa pan
 madan mohan malviya banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana ke liye dhan sangrah karne ke uddeshy se kalakatta aae to bhayeeji ne kai logon se milakar is kaary ke liye daan-raashi dilwaai
 In a case of working with the freedom movement and revolutionaries in Calcutta, the then British government arrested several prominent traders including Hanuman Prasad Poddar and sent them to jail on charges of treason
 in logon ne british sarkaar ke hathiyaaron ke ek jakhire ko lootakar use chhipaane main madad kii thi
 In jail, Bhaiji started worshiping Hanuman ji
 baad main unhen alipur jail main nazarband kar diya gaya
 During the detention, Bhaiji used his time well and there he used to start his daily routine at three in the morning and spend the whole time meditating on God
 baad main unhen najarband rakhte hue punjab kii shimalpal jail main bhej diya gaya
 There, a homeopathic doctor used to come to jail to check the health of the prisoners, Bhai ji learned the nuances of homeopathy from this doctor and after studying the books of homeopathy started treating the patients on their own
 baad main ve jamanalaal bajaj kii prerana se mumbai chale aae
 Here he came in close contact with personalities like Veer Savarkar, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Mahadev Desai and Krishnadas Jaju
 mumbai main unhone agarwal navayuvakon ko sangathit kar marwari khaadi prachaar mandal kii sthapana kii
 After this, he came in the satsang of the famous music composer Vishnu Digambar and music flowed in his heart
 phir unhone bhakthi geet likhe jo `patr-pushp' ke naam se prakashit hue
 In Mumbai, he was very impressed with the Gita recitation of his cousin Jayadayal Goenka
 unke gita ke prati prem or logon kii gita ko lekar jigyaasa ko dekhte hue bhai ji ne is baat kaa pran kiya ki ve shrimad bhagavadgita ko kam se kam mulya par logon ko uplabdh karaayenge
 He then wrote a commentary on the Gita and printed it in the commercial press of Calcutta
 pehle hi sanskaran kii paanch hajaar pratiyaan bik gai
 But Bhaiji was sad that there were many mistakes in this book
 iske baad unhone iskaa sanshodhit sanskaran nikaala magar isamen bhi galtiyaan doharaa gai thi
 This hurt Bhai ji's mind and he decided that unless he had his own press, this work would not proceed
 bas yahi ek chota sa sankalp gita press gorakhpur kii sthapana kaa aadhaar bana
 His brother Goenka ji's business was in Bankura at that time and he used to stay outside often in the discourse on Gita
 tab samasya yah thi ki press kahan lagaai jaae
 His friend Ghanshyam Das used to do business in Jalan Gorakhpur
 unhone press gorakhpur main hi lagaae jane or is kaary main bharpoor sahyog dene kaa aashwaasan diya
 After this, Geeta Press was established on 29 April 1923
 == kalyaan kaa armbh samvath 1983 vikrami main marwari agarwal mahasabha kaa vaarshik adhiveshan dilli main hua
 Its Chairman was Seth Jamnalal Bajaj and the Chairman was Shri Atmaram Khemka
 Initially, Khemkaji refused to be the head of the Swatantra for some reasons, later he agreed to Seth Jayadayal Goindka's request
 adhiveshan jaldi prarambh honevaala tha prashn udha swaagat bhaashan likhane kaa | khemka ji shastrajna tathaa vidwaan the, par unhen hindi likhane kaa abhyaas nahin tha
 He requested Shri Goindka to get the speech prepared
 shri goyandaka ji ne poddar ji ko dilli jaakar bhaashan taiyaar karne kaa aadesh diya
 Poddar went to Delhi and in 24 hours wrote and printed an extremely abstract speech
 log usamen vyakt vichaaron se bahut prabhavit hue | adhiveshan main bhaag lene ke liye seth ghanashyam das birla bhi aaye the
 Although he did not have complete consensus with Podar ji, however, he liked the speech
 duusare din apni pratikraya vyakt karte hue unhone poddar ji se kaha -- bheji tumlogon ke kya vichaar hai kaise hai kahantak thik hai isaki aalochana hamen nahin kerani | par inkaa prachaar tumlogon dwaara samaaj main ho rahaa he janata ise dur tak maanati bhi he
 If you had, you would get more success
 You take out a letter of your thoughts
 Poddarji said - the matter is fine but i have no experience in this regard
 Birla Ji urged and said try
 At that time the matter ended here
 Ghanshyam Das ji had said one thing as a consultation
 But this became the reason for the birth of Kalyan monthly
 After the session ended, all the people went to their respective places
 Poddar ji proceeded towards Bombay
 In those days, to go from Delhi to Bombay, one had to go to Ahmedabad via Rewari and from there change the car to Bombay
 Poddar went to Rewari from Delhi
 There was a half-hour route from Rewari to Bhiwani
 Poddar ji came to Bhiwani on those days from Churu and went there to meet Seth Jayadayal Goindkaji one day
 Seth ji had to go to Bankura and Poddar ji was in Bombay
 Both came together from Bhiwani to Rewari
 On the way, he discusses the suggestion given by Ghanshyam Das Seth ji liked the idea that along with Seth ji, he had Lachhiram Murodiya
 He also agreed
 He took a promise from Poddar ji that he would give two hours of time each day for editing
 Poddar talked about his inexperience, but Murodiyaji silenced him
 Now the question of name came
 "kalyan" came out of Poddar's mouth
 Seth ji and Murodia ji liked this name
 This is the case of Chaitra Shukla 9th Samvat 1983 on the day of Shri Rama Navami
 With this it was decided that welfare should be started with Akshaya Tritiya

 Shravan Krishna 11 Samvat 1983 Vikrami got "the first issue of Kalyan
 The publisher was Satsang Bhawan Nemani Badi Bombay
 Thus, the first issue of Kalyan was very much liked by everyone
 Initially it had 1600 customers, all were made and not made
 Kalyan For Gandhiji asked for blessings from Poddar
 Gandhiji advised him not to print advertisements and book reviews
 Poddar ji accepted it and gave it his life for life

 Along with this, he got the best artists to make attractive pictures of deities and published them in Kalyan
 bhai ji is kaary main itane tallin ho gaye ki ve apana puraa samay iske liye dene lage
 From editing the content of Kalyan to finalizing the look and feel of Bhaiji too

 Instead of recognizing Kalyan as a magazine of Hinduism alone, he published the articles of scholars of all religions, Jain sages, Ramanuja, Nimbark, Madhva, etc
 in it

 kalyaan ko or bhi rochak va gyanavardhak banane ke liye samay-samay par iske alag-alag vishyon par visheshank prakashit kiye gaye
 Bhai ji, during his lifetime, kept away from propagating such works which can only be imagined
 1936 main gorakhpur main bhayankar baadh aagai thi
 When Jawaharlal Nehru came to Gorakhpur for inspection of the flood-affected area, no person provided him a car under the pressure of the then British Government, because the British Collector had given a bully to all the people that whatever Nehru ji Car will give his name written in the list of rebels
 lekin bhai ji ne apni car nehru ji ko de di
 In 1938, when there was a severe famine in Rajasthan, Bhai ji reached the famine affected area and he made fodder for the famine victims as well as cattle
 badrinaath, jagannathpuri, rameswaram, dwarka, kaaldi shrirangam aadi sthanon par veda-bhawan tathaa vidyalayon kii sthapana main bhayeeji ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai

 filmon kaa samaaj par kaisaa dushprinaam aane vaala he in baton kii chetavanee bhai ji ne apni pustak `cinema manoranjan yaa vinaash' main dedi thi
 In the name of dowry, Bhai Ji had expressed his serious thoughts on this evil by writing a motivational book like 'dowry in marriage'
 mahilaon kii shiksha ke pakshdhar bhai ji ne `nari shiksha' ke naam se or shiksha-padhdati main sudhaar ke liye vartmaan shiksha ke naam se ek pustak likhi
 Bhai ji also contributed a lot in the cow protection movement
 san 1966 ke viraat goraksha aandolan me mahatma ramachandra vir dwaara kiye gayi 166 din ke anshan kaa inhone pura samarthan kiya
 There are many miraculous and inspiring events related to Bhai ji's life
 lekin unke jivan kii sabase mahatvapurn baat yahi he ki ek sampann parivaar se sambandh rakhane or apane jivan kaal main kai mahatvapurn logon se jude hone or unki nikatataa praapt karne ke baavjood bhai ji ko abhimaan chhu tak nahin gaya tha
 He kept thinking for the common man for a lifetime
 is desh main sanathan dharm or dharmik sahitya ke prachaar or prasar main unka yogadan ullekhneey he
 He did not take a portion of the income generated from the publication of books from Geeta Press Gorakhpur and made a written document that no member of his family would be a shareholder in its income
 angrejon ke jamaane main gorakhpur main unki dharm va sahitya seva tathaa unki lokapriyata ko dekhte hue tatkaaleen angrej colector pedley ne unhen `raay sahab' kii oopaadhi se alankrita karne kaa prastaav rakhaa tha, lekin bhai ji ne vinamratapurvak is prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya
 After this, British Commissioner Hobart proposed to confer the title of 'rai Bahadur' but Bhai ji did not accept this proposal either
 desh kii swadhinata ke baad dow, sampoornanand, kanhaiyalaal munshi or anya logon ke paraamarsh se tatkaaleen kendriya grih mantri govind vallabh pant ne bhai ji ko `bharat ratna' kii oopaadhi se alankrita karne kaa prastaav rakhaa lekin bhai ji ne isamen bhi koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 On 22 March 1971, Bhai Ji renounced this mortal body and left behind him a center known as 'geeta Press Gorakhpur', which is playing a leading role in spreading our culture throughout the world

 gaurav dilli main rahata he or vah aryan khanna kaa bahut bada fain rahata he
 Gaurav wins a competition there and continues to consider Aryan as his ideal
 iske baad vah uske janm din ke din use apana jeeta hua trophy dikhaane jaataa he
 He travels from Delhi to Mumbai without a train ticket
 aryan ke janmdin ke din gaurav uske ghar jane kii koshish karata he, lekin uske guard use andar jane nahin dete hai
 Sid Kapoor, who works with him, continues to criticize his fellow actor Aryan
 isse gaurav ko krodh aa jaataa he
 He threatens Sid
 cid us ghatana kaa video internet par daal detaa he
 After this Aryan also watches that video
 aryan apana car gaurav ko laane ke liye bhejtaa he
 But Sid's security guards arrive and Gaurav runs away
 par ve log use pakad kar police thane main le jate hai
 Aryan comes there and says that Gaurav is not his fan
 iske saath hi vah gaurav se kahata he ki ab vah aisa kabhi na kare or apane ghar laut jaae
 Gaurav goes to his house and then burns all the pictures of Aryan
 iske baad vah usase badla lene ke bare main sochataa he
 a year later, Gaurav destroys Aryan's name in a museum in London for tarnishing it
 police asli aryan ko giraftaar kar leti he lekin use jamaanat bhi mil jaataa he
 Aryan departs Dubrovnik
 use nahin pataa rahata he ki gaurav bhi dabrovanik main hi he
 Gaurav shows himself as an artist and goes to an event there
 yahan aryan apane karmiyon ko baahar dekhne ke liye bolta he or baad main use pataa chalata he ki gaurav uske utpaadan dal kaa hissaa bana he
 He discovers the entire building, but by then Gaurav escapes
 baad main jab aryan darpan main dekhtaa he to usamen likhaa rahata he ki gaurav ne hi aryan ko banaaya he
 Aryan attends a billionaire wedding for his next event
 vahaan bhi gaurav apana rup aryan kii tarah kar letaa he or vahaan us arbapati kii beti ke saath naachne lagata he
 At the same time, he starts killing
 isse arbapati krodh main asli aryan ko baahar nikaal detaa he
 Its video spreads all over the place and all its fans start distancing from it
 aryan ko tab tak pataa chal jaataa he ki gaurav uskaa peechha kar rahaa he
 He tells everyone that someone looks like him and is harming people
 bharat main waapas lautne ke baad gaurav waapas aryan ban jaataa he or aryan ke ghar main ja kar uske jite hue puraskaron ke kamare ko tabah kar detaa he
 Shortly after, Aryan comes there and Gaurav runs away
 aryan ko gaurav ke rishtedaaron se pataa chalata he ki vah ek pratiyogita main shaamil ho saktaa he
 Aryan makes a plan and with the girl whom Gaurav keeps in love with, Aryan expresses his love by telling himself to be Gaurav
 is ghatana se gaurav bhadak jaataa he or aryan use dekh letaa he
 Gaurav starts running from there and Aryan starts chasing him
 uske baad donon ke madhya ladaai shuru ho jaati he
 Aryan tells him that he should become pride instead of becoming Aryan
 iske baad gaurav bolta he ki usne sabakuch kaha lekin abhi tak maafee nahin maangi
 He then keeps falling from the mountain that Aryan catches him
 iske baad gaurav jawaab detaa he ki vah use kabhi samaj nahin paaegaa
 With this, he frees his hand
 vah muskuraate hue neeche gir jaataa he or uski maut ho jaati he
 He keeps smiling even after he dies
 iske baad aryan kaa naam sabhi vivaadon se hat jaataa he
 But every time he sees the crowd on his next birthday, he sees pride

 The Capler spacecraft is a spacecraft of the American Space Research Institute, NASA, whose job is to find non-planetary planets that resemble Earth, other than the Sun but around other stars
 kapler ko 7 march 2009 main roket ke zariye antariksh main bheja gaya tha, jahaan yah ab prithvi kii parikrama kar rahaa he or anya taron par apni nazaren rakhe hue he
 It is estimated that it will function for at least 3
5 years
 kepler mishan ke antargat kepler antariksh doordarshee prithvi jaise dikhne vaale grahon or unke soramandal kii sambhaavnaaon kaa pataa lagaataa he
 The Kepler telescope has discovered a cyclic binary asterisk
 iske antargat do taare ek duusare kaa chakkar laga rahe hai or ek upgrah in donon ke chaaron ore chakkar laga rahaa he
 The solar system is named Kepler-16b and the names of both stars are 34b and 35b respectively
 kepler 22 bi ek saura mandal ke baahar kaa grah he
 It has been discovered by the Kepler space telescope
 yah grah awasaiya kshetra main paaya gaya he
 It is the first planet under the Kepler mission to have been found in its Sun's habitable zone
 kepler 22 bi grah kii kuch pramukh visheshtaayen is prakaar hai- Pali literature mainly contains a collection of teachings of Lord Buddha, the founder of Buddhism
 kintu iskaa koi bhaag buddha ke jeevankaal main vyavasthit yaa likhit rup dhaaran kar chukaa tha, yah kahana kathin he
 Although there are some such references in Tripitaka itself, which shows the systematic reading of some episodes of religion during the lifetime of Buddha
 udaahranarth, udaan main varnan he ki ek baar seen naamak bhikshu se swayan bhagwaan ne poocha ki tumne dharm ko kaise samajha? iske uttar main us bhikshu ne 16 ashtak virgon ko puure swar ke saath gaakar suna diya
 God also praised it
 vinayapitak aadi granthon main bahushrut, dharmadhar, vinayadhar, maatrakaadhar tathaa panchanekayik, bhaanak, suttantik jaise visheshnon kaa prayog miltaa he, jinase spasht he ki buddha ke upadeshon ke dhaaran, paaran kii parampara unke jeevankaal se hi chal padi thi
 Based on this tradition, there are three references to musicals in the Chullavagga, Deepavansh, Mahavansh etc
 texts to give the Buddha's teachings a systematic literary form
 pratham sangeeti buddhanirvana ke chaar maas pashchaat hi rajgrih main hui jinamein 500 bhikshuon ne bhaag liya, jiske karan vah panchashatika naam se bhi prasiddh he
 It was presided over by Mahakashyapa and he collected the above topics with the approval of other monks, by asking questions related to the Vinaya and Suttha with Sthya Anand from the monk Upali, the disciple of Buddha
 isi prakaar kii duusari sangeeti buddha nirvana ke 100 varsh pashchaat vaishali main hui jisamen 700 bhikshu sammilit hue or isiilie vah saptshatika ke naam se vikhyath hui
 In this, by showing many faults in the conduct of the monks of Vaishali, they were held against Vinay and presumably special arrangements were brought in Vinayapitaka
 buddhaghosh ke matanusaar to isi sangeeti dwaara buddha vachanon kaa tripitak, paanch nikaay, nau ang tathaa churaasi hajaar dharmaskandhon main vargeekaran kiya gaya
 The third musical took place in Pataliputra during the reign of Emperor Ashoka after 226 years of buddha-nirvan
 isaki adhyakshata moggaliputt tiss ne kii
 The conference lasted for nine months and finalized the discourses in it
 isi bich moggaliputt tiss ne kathavatyu kii rachana kii jisamen 18 mithyaadrushti buddha sanshdaayon kii manyataon kaa niraakaran kiya
 This composition was also included in the Abhidhammapitaka
 is sangeeti kaa ullekh chullavagg main nahin he or na tibeti yaa chini mahayan sampradaay ke sahitya main
 There is no mention of any such music in Ashoka's Bhabru article, which also mentions the names of seven episodes, or in other scriptures
 is kaaran isaki aitihaasikta main kith, vailaser aadi vidwaanon ko andeh he
 But scholars like Rezdevids, Winternitz and Gaiger have accepted its historicity
 jis sangeeti kii aitihaasikta ke vishay main pracheen ullekh evam aadhuni vidvan ekamat he, vah he vaishali kii dwitiya sangeeti
 As a result of these music and other efforts, the form of Pali Tripitaka obtained and the form which is available to us today, is as follows: mul pali sahitya teen bhaagon main vibhakt he, jinhen pitak kaha gaya he - "vinayapitak", "suttapitak" or "abhidhammpitak"
 Each of these Pitakas consists of many small and large compositions related to their respective subjects
 pali ke in teen pitakon main i
 purv chhathi shatee main hue bhagwaan buddha ke vichaaron or upadeshon kaa ek vishesh style main sankalan kiya gaya he
 There is mutual correlation between the three pitas
 vishay kaa muladhar suttapitak he jisamen bhagwaan ke upadeshon ko shrotaaon ko hridyangam karaane ke liye saral se saral, rochak kathatmak style kaa alamban liya gaya he
 Here, there is no attempt to summarize the object
 uddeshy he nai-nai baton ko saamaanya shrotaaon ke grahan yogya bananaa or isiilie yahan upadesh ke mukhya bhaag kii baar-baar punrariti kii gai he
 Incidentally, these Sutts have also depicted the religious, social and political conditions of the time, which is very important from the point of view of ancient history
 udaahranarth, digh nikaay ke samanayfal sutt, brahmajaal sutt evam mahaparinibban sutt main buddha ke samasamyik dharmpravartakon jaise mankhaligosaal, pakudhakachchayan, ajit cese kambali, sanjay baltthiputt niganthnatputt, aadi ke aachaar-vichaaron tathaa unke dwaara pravartit dharm sampradaayon kii buddha drushti se aalochana pai jaati he or saath hi un-un vishyon par buddha manyata kaa pratipaadan bhi paaya jaataa he
 The social depiction is scattered in the Sutpitaka, although its contents are available to the Jatakas under the Kudak body
 sutton main sthaan-sthaan par buddhakalin magadh, videh, koshal, kaashi aadi 16 janapadon ke raajaaon unke paraspar sambandhon evam ladaai-jhagadon or daanv-penchon ke ullekh bhare pade hai
 The Buddhist ethos in which the signs of Buddhism are found in the sermons of sutas have also been arranged in the Vinaya Pitaka, from the law-prohibition-system as the rules of virtue worthy of the monks
 isi prakaar sutton main jis tatvachintan ke beej sannihit hai, unka darshanik shabdaawalee main saidhantik rup se pratipaadan or vivechan abhidhamm pitak main kiya gaya he
 Because of this interrelatedness, Buddhism cannot have complete sangopang and systematic understanding without Tripitaka's observation
 yah pali tripitak vishay kii drushti se swayan buddha bhagwaan ke upadeshon par aadhaarit he
 From the point of view of the available text, from the third century BCE onwards, it is not proved
 buddha paramparanusaar ashok samrat ke kaal main hi unke putr mahendra swayan buddha bhikshu banakar is sahitya ko lanka le gaye or vahaan pratham shatee i
 main raja battagamani ke rajyakaal main use vah likhit rup praapt hua jisamen vah aaj hamen miltaa he
 However, we do not find any such thing which can be visited in the period of two to three centuries due to the influence of the circumstances of Lanka
 apane namaanusaar vinayapitak kaa vishay bhikshuon ke paalane yogya sadachaar ke niyam upasthit karnaa he
 It has three different divisions - Suttavibhang, Khandhak and Parivar
 suttavibhang ke pun: do upavibhag hai - mahavagg or chullavagg
 Thus, compared to these subdivisions, the Vinayapitaka is divided into five parts
 suttapitak apane vishay, vistaar tathaa rachana kii drushti se tripitak kaa sabase mahatvapurn bhaag he
 It contains a collection of Sutras which according to tradition are either stated by Lord Buddha himself or are assigned by his disciple and approved by Lord Buddha himself
 sutt kaa sanskrit roopaantar sutara kiya jaataa he
 But the formulas presented in the Sutras are not visible in the formulas that are found in the ancient formulas of Sanskrit, such as the Srauta Sutras of Vedic literature, Grihama and Dharmasutra etc
 sutara kaa vishesh lakshan he ati sankshep main kam se kam shabdon main adhik se adhik arth vyakt karnaa
 There is a complete lack of repetition in it
 kintu yahan sankshipt style ke vipareet suvistrut vyaakhyaan tathaa mukhya baton kii baar-baar punrariti kii style apanaai gai he
 For this reason the Sutra version of Sutta does not seem appropriate
 vichaar karne se anumaan hota he ki sutt kaa abhipraay mulat: sookt se rahaa he
 Each episode of the Vedas has also been called Sukta
 kisi ek baat ke pratipaadan ko sookt kahana sarvatha uchit prathit hota he
 There are five parts of suttapitaka called bodies - Dighnikaya, Majjhimnikaya, samyuktanikaya, Angusadnikaya and Khudkadnikaya
 dirghanikaay teen virgon main vibhajit he
 The first sealakhandhavagga has 13 suttas, the second Mahavagga has 10 and the third patikavagga has 11
 is prakaar dirghanikaay main 34 sutt hai
 This Sutta is longer in detail than the Sutras stored in other bodies and this is the meaning of the name of this body
 majjhimanikaay main madhyamvistaar ke 152 sutt he jo 15 virgon main vibhakt hai - Of these, there are 12 suttas in the 14th class Vibhang and ten each in the rest
 sanyuttanikaay main chote bade sabhi prakaar ke sutton kaa sangrah he or yahi is nikaay ke naam kii sarthakata he
 There are a total of 56 suttas or samyutas divided into these five classes - angutar nikaay kii apni ek visheshta he
 In this, the collection of Sutras is done according to an arrangement
 aadi main aise sutt hai jinamein buddha bhagwaan ke ek sankhyatmak padaartho vishyak upadeshon kaa sangrah he, tatpashchaat do padaarthon vishyak sutton kaa or phir teen, chaar aadi
 In the same order within this body is a compilation of eleven niches of these names Ekknipat, Dukanipat & Tik, Chatuvak, Panchak, Chhak, Sattak, Atthak, Navak, Dasak and Ekadasak
 ye nipaat pun: virgon main vibhajit hai, jinaki sankhya nipaat kram se 21, 16, 16, 26, 12, 9, 9, 9, 22 or 3 he
 Thus, the total number of classes in 11 nipatas is 169
 prayek varg ke bheetar anek sutt hai jinaki sankhya ek varg main kam se kam 7 or adhik se adhik 262 he
 Thus, the number of sutas from Angusvada Nikaya is 2308
 khuddak nikaay main vishay tathaa rachana kii drushti se praaia: sarvatha swatantra 15 rachanaaon kaa samavesh he, jinke naam hai - The third part of the Pali Tripitaka, Abhidhammapitaka, analyzes and classifies the visual thoughts of Lord Buddha and presents lists and definitions from the point of view of nature
 is pitak main nimna saat granthon kaa samavesh he- Dhamamsani is divided into two parts according to her mother
 pratham bhaag main 22 tik hai jinamein se prayek main teen teen vishyon kaa vivechan kiya gaya hai
 There are 100 shops in the second department and each shop has a law and prohibition of two subjects
 ye duk 12 virgon main vibhajit hai jinke naam hai - Thus the number of dhikamsani's tikas and dukes is 122
 inamen se pratham tik kushal, akushal tathaa avyaakrit dharmavishyak he, jo sabase mahatvapurn he or uske vishay kaa prarupan chittupapad rup nikkshep or atthuddhar in chaar candon main kiya gaya he
 The theme of Vibhang is divided into 18 departments
 kathavatthu main 23 adhyyon ke bheetar 216 prashnottar hai jinamein virdohi sampradaayon ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 There are 10 chapters in Puggalpannatti, in which, in the increasing order of one type, two type, etc
, in the tenth chapter, 10, 10 types of Pudgals, ie individuals, have been instructed
 vyaktiyon kaa vibhaajan pruthgjan, samyak sambuddha, prayek buddha, shaikshya, ashaikshya, arya, anarya aadi rup se kiya gaya he
 The basis of the composition of the metal story is different, because the first three, namely, the wing, volume and metal fractures of the same, have been discussed more closely here
 isi kaaran is granth kaa doosraa naam khamb-aaytan-dhatukatha bhi paaya jaataa he
 The relationship of these three is mentioned in the book by sitting with religions
 matikanusaar in dharmon kii sankhya 125 he jo is prakaar hai - These are interlinked in 14 chapters in the style of Q&A
 yamak main dharmon kaa sambandh vishesh vishyon ke saath paraspar vipareet rup main prashnottar style se samajhaayaa gaya he or isi yugal prashnaatmak reeti ke kaaran is rachana kaa yamak naam sarthak he
 Like are all skilled religions efficient? Are all Kushamul Kushal religions? And so on
 isi paddati se yamak main abhidhammpitak main prayukt paribhaashik shabdon kii sunishchit vyakhya dene kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 This composition is divided into these 10 punks - patthan main buddha tatvachintan ke aadharbhoot pratithya-samutpaada-siddhant kaa ek vishesh style main bade vistaarpurvak vivechan kiya gaya he
 The main four parts of the book are - in chaaron bhaagon main dhammsangani main nirdisht 22 tikon or 100 dukon kaa 24 pratyayon se sambandh nimna chah patthanon dwaara samajhaayaa gaya he : tik pan duk pan duk-tik pan tik-duk pan tik-dik pan or duk-duk pa
 With the preservation of these six articles in the previous four departments, the entire book is divided into 24 pieces
 uparyukt tripitak sahitya kaa sankalan praaia: i
pus
 teesri shatee main purna ho gaya tha, kintu pali sahitya kaa srijan iske pashchaat bhi chalata rahaa
 Although, in terms of the subject of relevant literature, it usually imitates the knowledge completely under Tripitaka, yet in its form and style, development is seen in it according to the pace of time
 i
pus
 pratham shatee ke lagbhag nettprikaran naamak granth likhaa gaya jisamen abhidhammpitak ke vishay kaa hi kuch adhik sookshmata se vivechan kiya gaya he
 It has attempted to explain the definitions of Buddhist philosophy through 16 necklaces, 5 new and 18 original verses
 iske karta kaa naam kacchan he
 a similar composition is the Petkopadesh of about this period, in which the theme of Netification is presented in some other way, in which the four Aryan truths are the mainstay which are the foundation of Buddha's teachings
 praaia: isi kaal kii teesri rachana he - milind-panhon jo pali sahitya main apni visheshta rakhti he va aitihaasik drushti se bhi badi mahatvapurn he
 It describes a conversation between the King of Sakal, Milind and the monk Nagsen
 milind us yavan naresh minadar ke naam kaa hi roopaantar mana gaya he jisane i
 pus
 dwitiya shatee ke madhya main bharat par akraman kiya tathaa punjab pradesh main apana rajya jamaaya tha
 According to the text presented, this king was very scholarly and interested in philosophical subjects
 usne bhikshu nagsen se bade paine darshanik prashn kiye, jiske uttar bhi nagsen ne badi chaturaai se sundar drushtaanton dwaara unki pushti karte hue die hai
 There are seven chapters in the book - inamen se pratham teen adhyay hi granth kaa mul bhaag mana jaataa he
 The remaining four chapters appear to be added backwards
 iske anek kaaran hai- ek to tisare adhyay main granth ke pun: prarambh kii soochna he; duusare, buddhaghosh ke avataran praaia: teen hi adhyyon se liye gaye hai or tisare is granth kaa jo chini anuwaad 400 i
 ke lagbhag kiya gaya tha, usamen keval ye teen hi adhyay paae jate hai
 This composition is very interesting in style and unique in its style for the knowledge of Buddhist doctrine
 in rachanaaon ke pashchaat atthakathaon kaa yug prarambh hota he
 According to the Shrut tradition, when Maali and Sanghamitra reached Pali Tripitaka Lanka and Buddhism flourished, those original texts were written in the Sinhalese language
 ye atthakathaayen ab uplabdh nahin he
 Presumably, the reason for the creation of those books is to miss the teaching of those original books
 in nai pali atthakathaon ke karta acharya buddhaghosh kaa naam pali sahitya main bahut prasiddh he
 Among the Sinhalese chronicles he has mentioned and whose incarnations he has taken in his fables, the main ones are- antim chaar atthakathaayen nikaayon athwa unke kinhin vishyon ke vishesh vyaakhyaan ke rup main prathit hote hai
 In the absence of these original chronicles, it is difficult to say to what extent Buddhaghosha imitated them and how radically they did, however it seems clear from looking at his compositions that he has given the original choreography by his vast knowledge of Tripitaka
 Must have flourished
 unki atthakathaayen vinayapitak, suttapitak evam abhidhammpitak ke adhikansh bhaagon par milti hai, jinaki sankhya 16 he
 Apart from these eight stories, there is a specific composition of Buddhaghosha, Visuddhimagga, which can be called the enlightenment of Buddhist philosophy
 atthakathaon main swayan buddhaghosh ke kathananusaar unhone visuddhimagg main digh, majjhim, sanyutt or angutar in chaaron nikaayon kaa saar bhar diya he
 According to the dictated tradition, he had written Visuddhimagga to prove his mettle before his works
 is granth main kul 23 pariched hai
 The subject of the first two passages is "samadhi" and the remaining verses discuss "pragya"
 buddhaghosh ke pashchaat atthakathaon kii parampara ko unke praaia: samasamyik do aacharyon buddhadutt or dhammpal ne paripusht kiya
 Buddhadatta summarized Vinayapitaka's story titled Samudhapasadika, Buddhaghosha, in his post-scripture and Vinayavinchashya, and composed a prose-verse-compound text called Abhidhammavatara based on Buddhaghosa's Abhidhamma choreography
 isamen moulikta yah he ki jahaan buddhaghosh ne rup, vednadi paanch skandhon ke dwaara dharmon kaa vivechan kiya he, vahaan buddhadutt ne chittar, chetsik, rup or nirvana is chaar prakaar ke vargeekaran ko apanaaya he
 same classification in his composition named as Vibhag
 buddhadutt kii ek or rachana he madhuratth vilasini, jo buddhawans kii atthkatha he
 Dhammapala has written seven books
 khuddakanikaay ke antargat jin udaan, itishuttak, vimaanavtthu, petavatthu, thergatha, therigatha ev chariapitak naamak granthon par buddhaghosh ne atthakathaayen nahin likhin, unpar dhammpal ne paramatthdipani naamak atthkatha likhi he
 Likewise wrote the commentary called Atathasvanna on Nettikaran and the commentary called Leenatthvannana on the same, Paramatthamunjusha on Visuddhimagga, Lekanthapakasini on the fables of the four bodies of Buddhaghosha, the commentary on the Jatakattakatha and the commentary of Buddhaattatta
 in sab rachanaaon main sabase adhik prasiddh he unki visuddhimagg kii tikaa
 There is no distinction in the remaining compositions
 yadhyapi ukt tripitak va unki atthakathaon kii rachana ke pashchaat nahin he
 Although after the creation of the said Tripitaka and his stories, there is not much to be said in relation to the Buddhist text, yet the creation of the commentary literature called this Attakatha continued to be on par with the Buddhaghosha era
 inamen se kuch rachanaayen is prakaar hai : Anandkrit Abhidhamma original vaccine, Chulldmmpal integrated 'true essence', Upasen integrated Sddhmmppjotik Mahanam integrated Sdsmmppakasini, Kssp integrated Mahvichcedni and Vimtichcedni, Vjrabuddhi integrated Snmtwpasadika vaccine, well-being integrated Kemppakrn, Aniruddha integrated Abhidmmtthsngho Prmtthviniscy and Namrupprichced, Dharmsri integrated Khuddksickha and Mahaswamji integrated Mulsickha
 12veen shatee se atthakathaon par magadhi bhashaa main hi tikaaon kii rachana prarambh hui
 To facilitate this work, a musical work was done by the Sinhalese stabilizer Mahakassap during the reign of Lanka King Parakramabahu I, which resulted in eight commentaries written on the Samantapasadika etc
 stories, namely Dipani, Manjusa, Pacasini etc
 Only the written Sarathdipani vaccine is available
 iske karta sariputt kii teen anya tikaayen bhi milti hai- Sumangal, Saddhammjotipal, Dhammakirti, Budharvikhat and Meghankar - all of them have written commentaries on different fables
 inamen akele vaachissar ther ke mul sikha tikaa aadi das tikaa granth milte hai
 In the 13th century many texts like Samantakootavannana were composed by Sthavira Videha, Budhapriya and Dharmakirti
 14veen shatee kii rachanaaon main chaar kavy granth prasiddh hai- The names of the authors of the latter three compositions are unknown
 14veen shatee ke pashchaat pali-sahitya-srijan kaa kshetra lanka se uthakar brahmadesh main pahunch gaya
 The litterateurs here made Abhidhamma particularly the subject of study
 15veen shatee kii kuch rachanaayen hai- In the 16th century, Saddhammalankar wrote a commentary on the case of Patahana called Patahandeepani and wrote an epilogue called Madhusaraya Deepani on the Abhidhamma-moola-tika enjoyed by Mahanama
 17veen shatee main tripitakalankar ne atthasalini par kii bees gaathaon main visativannana, sariputtakrut vinayasangrah par vinayalankar naamak tikaa tathaa yasavadjnavatthu in teen granthon kii rachana kii

 The three compositions of the Sangharaj of Brahmadesa, the ninth century of Gyanamivanshnam, are famous- 19veen shatee kii brahmadesh kii kuch rachanaayen hai- nalatadhatu vans, sandes katha simavivadvinishchay aadi
 The works of this century named Chhakeshadhatuvans, Gandhavans and Sasanavans have been introduced under Vans literature

 It would not be inappropriate to mention two works of the 20th century as evidenced by the uninterrupted stream of Pali literature
 ye hai bharatvarsh main bhandat dharmanand kosambi dwaara rachit visuddhimaggadipika or abhidhammatthsangrah kii navaneet tikaa
 It can be said from the basis of this introduction that even after two and a half thousand years the policy-making section has not been separated
 lanka main jis samay tripitak par atthakathaon kii rachana kii ja rahi thi, usee samay duusari ore kuch granthkaaron main aitihaasik ruchi jaagrath hui jiske parinamswaroop dipavansh kii rachana kii gai
 The history of Lanka is described in these texts, from the earliest times to the reign of King Mahasena
 is rachana kaa upyog buddhaghosh ne apni atthakathaon main prachurtaa se kiya he or kahin-kahin uske avataran bhi die hai
 In this way, the composition of Deepavans is proved between the fourth and fifth centuries AD
 sinhal ke raajaaon ke saath-saath yahan buddha ke jivan, unke shishyon kii parampara evam teenon sangitiyon aadi kaa vivaran kuch badha chadhaakar kiya gaya he
 Presumably, the basis of its subject has been the above mentioned Sinhala story
 yah rachana pali-gadhy-mishrit he, style bahut kuch shithil he, punaruktiyaan bhi bahut he or rachana bhashaa, chand aadi ke dosha se mukt nahin he
 These characteristics are indicative of its antiquity and there is evidence that the content in it has been compiled from many sources and there was no special effort to bring editorial system in it
 kintu aitihaasik drushti se lanka main aadi se hi iskaa bada aadar rahaa he
 It is said that in the 5th century AD, Sinhala king Dhatusen taught it with national pride on the occasion of an annual festival
 bhartiya aitihaasik rachnaao main dipawans ni:sadeh ek prachinatam rachana he
 Some time after the creation of Deep Vansh, Mahanavas were created by Mahanam
 iskaa muladhar bhi ve hi sinhal kii atthakathaayen tathaa dipavansh he
 Here the rendering of the subject is more vivid and systematic than that of Deepavansh
 bhashaa bhi apekshaakrit adhik parimarjeet or style to kahin kahin mahakavyon kii paddati kaa samaran karaati he
 The original portion of the Mahavansha is of 37 passages and ends on the reign of Mahasena, similar to the Dipavansh
 prarambh ke parichchhedon main, jo lanka main bauddhadharm ke aagaman se purv desh kii dharmik paristhitiyon ke ullekh aae hai, ve aitihaasik drushti se bade mahatvapurn hai
 For example, the reign of the Pandyakamayya king is said to have lasted for 60 years before the entry of Buddhism into Lanka by Mahendra
 is raja ne 70 varsh rajya kiya tathaa rajya ke 10wein varsh main hi anuradhapur nagar kii sthapana kii
 Beyond this, additions have been made from time to time in this composition
 37wein pariched kii 50veen gaatha se aage 79wein pariched tak kii rachana sthavir dharmakirti krit he or usamen mahasen ke kaal se lekar parakrambahu pratham tak 78 raajaaon kii vanshaparampara di gai he
 This passage from the Mahavansh and beyond is called the Chulavansh
 chulvansh 80 se 90 tak ke 11 parichchhedon ke rachayita buddharakshit bhikshu ne aagaamee 23 raajaaon kaa varnan kiya jo parakrambahu chaturth tak aayaa
 10 passages from 91 to 100 were composed by Sumangal Ther and described 24 kings from Bhuvanekabhu III to the period of Kirtishree Raj Singh
 yahan lanka main isai dharm ke prachaar kii bhi soochna milti he
 The next 101st passage was composed by Sumangalacharya and Devarakshita
 tatpashchaat vahaan kaa rajya angrejon ke haath main chale jane kii bhi soochna he
 The last outgrowth of the great dynasty was published in 1936 by the monk Pragyanand Nayak and contains the history of Lanka from 1815 to 1935 AD
 is prakaar mahavansh kii rachana main chah granthkaaron kaa haath he jinke dwaara isamen bhagwaan buddha se lekar lagbhag dhai hajaar varshon kaa lanka kaa itihaas avichhinn rup se ankit kiya gaya he
 This book is also a symbol of how the Pali language was kept alive in Lanka for the said long period and the stream of literary work was never allowed to dry up in it
 dipavansh or mahavansh rachanaaon ne teevr aitihaasik vritti jaagrath kii
 As a result, many other books called the dynasty were composed
 isamen aitihaasik tathy to praaia: ukt donon granthon se hi liye gaye hai, kintu unamem jo naanaa vishyon kii shrutiparampara ko ekatra kar diya gaya he, vah mahatvapurn he
 In order to give importance to the subject, a lot of exaggerations and fantasies have also been taken shelter, due to which the historian starts to develop excitement or insolence
 is prakaar kii mukhya rachanaayen ye hai - In the above texts, for the most part, the ancient Tripitaka, their stories and the dialogue under Mahavansh is merely a repetition or elaboration
 kintu phir bhi unamem apane apane vishay kii kuch moulikta bhi he jiske aadhaar se hamen ukt vishyon kaa kuch itihaas buddhakaal se lagaakar ab tak kaa avichhinn rup main praapt hota he

 The most widely accepted theory is that the military designation of GP gave rise to the word "jeep" and it is believed that the vehicle adopted the designation "GP", which was phonetically distorted into the word Jeep

 When it became clear that the United States was eventually going to be involved in a raging war in Europe, the US Army approached 135 companies for working prototypes of a four-wheeler surveyed driverless car

 The Army had set a seemingly impossible deadline of 49 days to supply a working prototype

 The bankrupt American Bantam Car Company had no engineering staff left at a regular salary and called Carl Probst, a talented independent designer from Detroit
 baintum se ek shuruaati anurodh ko asweekaar kar dene ke baad, probst ne sena dwaara dubaara kahe jane ke baad is naukari ko sweekaar kar liya or aarambh main vetan ke bagaiyr kaam karte hue 17 july 1940 ko kaam par chalaa gaya
 Probst prepared plans for the bantam prototype in two days and estimated the total cost of the vehicle the following day

 vaahan sena ke maandand par sahi baitha lekin iskaa engine sena kii tork sambandhi jaruraton ke anuroop nahin tha
 The Army believed that the Bantam Company was too small to supply the number of vehicles it needed, which is why it handed over the Bantam design to Willys and Ford, who were encouraged to make changes and modifications on their own

 operent condishning vyavhaar ke prati samvedansheel he, yaa uske parinaamon ke dwaara niyantrit he, jisamen ek seekhney kii prakriya he
 For example, a child can learn to avoid touching a hot stove or to open a box to get candy inside
 In contrast, classical conditioning causes a motivation to signal a positive or negative outcome; The resulting behavior does not produce the result
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek rangeen aavaran kii drushti se ek bachche kaa raal nikaalnaa yaa ek darwaja slam kii aawaaj se ek bachche kaa kaanpana,jis se gusse main mata pita sanket karte he
 Sometimes played an important role in learning conditioning, first studied by Edward L
 Thorndick, who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from the largely homemade puzzle boxes
 ek billi is tarah ke ek rassi khinch yaa ek pole dhakelne ke rup main ek saral pratikriya se box se batch saktaa he, lekin pehali baar vivash jab billiyon baahar nikalne ke liye ek lanbaa samay laga
 
 baar-baar pareekshan ke saath aprabhavi pratikriyaaon kam baar hua or safal pratikriyaaon adhik baar hua he, to billiyon adhik se adhik teji se bhaag nikle
 Thorndick generalizes this conclusion in his law of influence which states that behaviors followed by satisfactory results become repetitive and that those producing unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated
 sankshep main, kuch parinaam vyavhaar ko majboot banane or kuch parinaam vyavhaar kamjor
 Thorndick of plotting the escape time against test number produced curves by learning the first known animal through this process
 maanav ab condishning bulaayaa thorandic dwaara adhyayan prakriya kii tarah he, jiske madhyam se kai saral vyavhaar ko jaanane ke liye dikhaai dete hai
 They produce adverse effects when they are not, or when reactions are retained and discarded, when they lead to a successful outcome
 yah aamtaur par kisi bhi " shikshak" dwaara yojana banaai ja rahi bina hota he, lekin condishning hajaaron saal ke liye apane bacchon ko padhaane main mata-pita dwaara istemaal kiya gaya he| Skinner is often known as the father of conditioning skinner ke kriyaprasut anukulan siddhant ke anusaar, vyavhaar ke parinaam, kriya ke hone kii sambhaavna ko prabhavit karte hai
 a behavior after which a soothing stimulus is associated is more likely to occur repeatedly, but it is less likely to occur if the other behavior is associated with a punitive stimulus
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek balak ke kisi vyavhaar ko agar ek muskaraahat dwaara pratikriya di jaae to us balak dwaara vah vyavhaar punah karne kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 But if there is an angry response to such behavior, then the chances of showing that behavior again are reduced
 udhaaharan ke liye, skinner ke anusaar ek bachche ke andar uske vaataavaran main upasthit anubhavon ke aadhaar par sharmaane kaa vyavhaar viksit ho saktaa he agar vaataavaran ko punah sthapit kar diya jaae to baccha saamaajik taur par kushal ho saktaa he
 According to Skinner, rewards and punishments shape a person's development

 In this Brahma itself, due to the deflection, the illusion of Maya has arisen in the same way as different shapes are formed by waves in the ocean, just as the basic elements made of gold and clay are the same, despite having the original elements gold and clay, we have different shapes
 It is visible and just as the spider itself creates a huge net by itself, similarly the conscious and unconscious mother Obtained and the evolution of the world of the unconscious Maya

 The credit worthiness of that institution is taken into account in determining the creditworthiness of the institution issuing a loan and this also affects the interest rate levied on the particular security issued

 In 2003, the Security and Exchange Commission submitted a report to Congress detailing the credit rating agencies' anti-competitiveness methodology and plans to conduct an inquiry for issues involving interest-related disputes
 adhik jaankaree ke liye dekhen, band credit reating Agencies that determine the credit rating of corporations include the following: credit reating kaa prayog niveshkon, rin nirgamit karne vaali sansthaaon, nivesh bank, dallalon-vyapaariyon or sarkaar dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Credit rating institutions broaden the field of investment options for investors and provide a simple and independent way of measuring relative credit risk; This generally increases market efficiency and reduces costs for both borrowers and lenders

 jarikarta, apni saakh yogyata or apane dwaara jari upkaran ke parinami mulya ke swatantra pramanikaran ke rup main in credit retings par nirbhar karte hai
 In most cases, for a particular bond to be successful it must have at least a rating by a reputable CRA
 Studies by the Bond Market Association state that many institutional investors are now priming this Let's say that there are at least three ratings for any debt issue
 jarikarta, credit retings kaa kuch nishchit niojit vitt sambandhi lenden ke liye bhi prayog karte hai
 For example, a company with a very high credit rating that wishes to undertake a risky project may form a statutory separate entity with certain assets that will conduct research and Will be responsible iske baad yah "vishisht lakshya vaali sanstha" anusandhan kaary ke vitt poshan ke liye usase hone vaale sabhi sambhavit jokhim kaa uttardaayitv apane upar lekar apni swayan kii rin pratibhuti jari karegi
 The rating of the specific target entity will likely be very low and the issuer will have to pay a higher rate of return on the bond issued
 haalanki, is jokhim se mul company kii samgr credit reating kam nahin hogi kyonki vaidhanik rup se espei ek alag sanstha hogi
 Conversely, a company with a low credit rating can borrow on good terms, provided it forms an SPE and issues a protected debt by transferring its significant assets to that subordinate company
 is prakaar se, yadi uskaa udhyam asafal bhi ho jaataa he to udhaar dene waalon ke paas espei ke rup main strot uplabdh rahegaa
 isse vah byaaj dar bhi kam ho jaaegi jiskaa espei ko rin ke bakaayaa ke rup main bhugtan karnaa hoga
 The same issuer may have different credit ratings for different types of bonds
 yah bhinnata band kii sanrachana ke kaaran hoti he, jaise ki vah kis prakaar sangrakshit he or vah kis seemaa tak anya rin ke adhinsth he
 Many large CRA entities feature "credit Rating Advisory Services", which essentially advises an issuer on how to outline their bond offer and advises SPE entities on how Obtain the required credit rating for a certain fraction of the loan
 swaabhaavik rup se isse sambhavit hit sangharsh chaalu ho jaataa he kyonki yadi jarikarta band kii ruparekha ke sambandh main siaare kii salaah ko maanane ko taiyaar ho jaataa he to vah jarikarta ko aavashyak reating dene ke liye baadhya hoga
 Some cras avoid this struggle by refusing to give ratings to loan proposals for which they have been consulted
 niyantrankarta, niamak uddeshyon ke liye credit reating ke saath-saath permit reating kaa bhi prayog karte hai
 For example, banking controllers, when they are required to calculate their net reserve capital, banks under the Basel II Agreements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have certain accredited cras, or "external credit rating institutions"
 May allow the use of a credit rating of
 sanyukt rajya main, da securities and exange kamishan aise hi uddeshyon ke liye investment bainkon or dalal-vyapaariyon ko "neshanali recognised statistical reating argenisations" kii credit reating kaa prayog karne kii anumati detaa he
 The idea behind this is that if the financial institution's maximum investment is in the form of excessive cash and extremely "safe" securities, then the bank and other financial institutions should hold the same amount of reserve capital to protect their institutions as opposed to the authority of the bank Do not need siaare kii reating kaa prayog anya vyavsaayik uddeshyon ke liye bhi hota he
 The US SEC, for example, allows certain bond issuers to use a reduced statement form during the issuance of a bond, provided the issuer is older, has previously issued the bond and if its credit rating is above a certain threshold Ho
 esaisi ke niyamon ke anusaar yah bhi aavashyak he ki puunji bazaar kii nidhi insurance se rahit hote hai) main maatr vahi pratibhutiyaan hon jinaki enaresaro reating bahut ucch ho
 Similarly, the Controller of Insurance uses a credit rating to determine the workingability of reserves held by insurance companies
 besel II or esaisi donon ke hi niyamon ke antargat, niamak uddeshyon ke liye kisi bhi siaare kii reating kaa prayog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 balki, is sambandh main kai prakaar kii jaanch prakriyaayein astitv main hai
 The Basel II directive, for example, mentions certain parameters that bank controllers should consider when allowing the use of ratings provided by a particular CRA
 iname "nishpakshta," "swatantraaa," "paardarshita" or anya shaamil hai
 Since then, the banking controllers of many jurisdictions have started issuing their own discussion papers on the subject by which they are explaining the fact more clearly how these terms will be used in practice
 sanyukt rajya main, 1975 se enaresaro kii manyata esaisi karmchaaree dwaara bheje gaye ek "no ection latter" ke dwaara sweekaar kii jaati he
 Following this method, if a CRA is willing to use the rating of a particular CRA for regulatory purposes, SEC staff will conduct market research to determine whether the rating of that CRA would be used on a broader scale
 Or not and whether its rating is "reliable and authentic"
 yadi esaisi ke karmchaaree yah tay karte hai ki aisa he, to ve siaare ko ek patr bhejenge jisame yah sanket diya jaayegaa ki yadi koi niyantrak sanstha siaare kii reating par vishwaas karne vaali he to esaisi karmchaaree us sanstha ke viruddh kisi bhi jabaran kriya kii anumati nahin degaa
 These "no action" letters can be made public and in addition to the entity that actually requested them, other regulatory bodies can also trust them

 On September 29, 2006, US President George W

 is kanoon ke anusaar yues security and exange kamishan yah spasht karne ke liye baadhya he ki enaresaro kii manyata kis prakaar sweekaar kii jaati he, yah "no ection letters" ko radd kar detaa he or enaresaro kii manyata ko kamishan kaa nirnay bana detaa he karmchaaree dwaara liye gaye nirnay ke) or enaresaro ko baadhya karata he ki vah esaisi dwaara panjikrut tathaa uske dwaara niyantrit bhi ho
 The S&P opposed the act on the grounds that it was an illegal violation of the law of freedom of speech

 Given the role of the CRA in capital formation, some governments attempted to launch their own domestic rating agency business with a variety of regulatory concessions and incentives
 haalanki, yah pratikul bhi ho saktaa he, yadi yah kam samarth agenciyon kii sahaayta ke dwaara or ucch gunvattta yukt vichaaron ke liye saadhan uplabdh karne vaali agenciyon ko dandit karne ke dwaara bazaar kii us kriyavali ko mand kar de jisase agenciyaan pratispardhaa karti hai
 Credit rating agencies can also play a major role in planned financial transactions
 ek "vishisht" rin yaan band ke jarikaran se bhinn, jahaan udhaar lene vaala rin par ek nishchit pratifal dene kaa prastaav rakhata he, niojit vittiya lenden ko yaa to vibhinn lakshanon se yukt rinon kii ek shrankhla yaa phir ek hi prakaar ke anekon chote rinon ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he jo ek saath "gatthar" kii ek shrankhla ke rup main sankalit kar die gaye hai 
 credit reating praayah byaaj dar yaa ek vishesh ansh se sambandhit mulya ko nirdhaarit karti he, yah us samooh ke antargat aane vaale rin kii gunvattta yaan sampatti kii gunvattta par aadhaarit hota he
 Companies engaged in planned finance often consult with credit rating agencies to determine the composition of individual shares, so that each gets the desired rating
 For example, a farm may wish to borrow a significant amount of capital by issuing debt securities
 haalanki, yah puunji itani badi he ki niveshak iske ekal nirgaman ke liye jis pratifal kii maang karenge, jo pratishedhaatmak hoga
 In return, it decides to issue three separate bonds which will have three different credit ratings - A, BBB and BB
 The firm expects that the effective interest it pays on an A-rated bond will be much lower than what it would pay for a bb-rated bond, but also that it has been raised, overall
 The amount required to be paid for the total capital will be less than the amount it would have to pay for the capital raised through a single bond
 After planning this type of transaction, the firm can consult a rating agency on how to configure each piece - in other words, what kind of assets to use to secure debt in each share - So that it can get the desired rating when the excerpt is released

 The rating agencies responded that their advice only analyzes a "time-specific" and that they make it very clear that they never make any promises regarding a particular rating for a fraction and neither They take some responsibility and also say that they also make it clear that any change in the circumstances regarding the risk factors related to a particular part
 Lava will cancel the validation of their analysis and will result in a new credit rating
 iske atirikt, kuch siaare un band ke jarikaran ko reating nahin detii jinke liye unhone is prakaar kii salaah di he
 To make matters more complicated, especially in relation to planned finance transactions, rating agencies state that the ratings given by them are given the possibility that a debt security will fail over a certain period of time and that There are no views given on the stability of that security and they do not give instructions at all on whether to invest or not on that security
 In the past, the main characteristics of the most highly rated securities were low volatility and high liquidity - in other words, the value of a high-rated bond did not change much daily and the seller of such securities was easily a buyer
 Used to get haalanki, aise niojit lenden jisame ek hi prakaar ke saikadon or hazaron pratibhutiyon ko ek saath liya jaataa he, usame samaan prakaar ke jokhim ke sankendrit hone kii sambhaavna bhi bad jaati he or yah aisa hota he ki kisi akaran kii sambhaavna main sanyogvash hua koi chota sa parivartan bhi pratibhutiyon ke us samooh par bahut bada prabhaav daal saktaa he
 This means that although a rating agency may be correct in its view that the probability of default in a planned product is very small, there is a small change in market attitudes regarding the risk of that product
 Can have a far greater impact on market prices than it is, as a result, even a security with an AAA or Aaa rating may be absent in the absence of any default
 It can also be heaped in terms of value
 yah sambhaavna kai mahatvapurn niamak muddon ko janm detii he kyonki pratibhutiyon or banking niyamon main reating kaa prayog is baat kaa parichaayak he ki ucch reating kaa sambandh kam asthirataa or adhik taralata se hota he

 The sage gave him the name of 'gurukul education system'

 The education system of the Pandit congregation did not meet the requirements of the time, in which the knowledge-sciences of the present era did not have any place, it nurtured the hypocrisies

 Rishi Dayanand felt that these defects should be removed by reviving the ancient Gurukul system in India

 Mahatma Munshi Ram, a prominent disciple of Rishi Dayanand in 1897, gave the following reasons for the need to start Gurukula - 19veen shatabdi main bharat main do prakaar kii shikshapaddatiyaan prachlit thim
 The first method was the system of government schools and universities developed by the British government to meet the requirements of its governance and the second was the school system of studying various disciplines of Sanskrit, grammar, philosophy, etc

 Although Indian poetry was studied in it, there was a gross neglect of knowledge science necessary for the new and present time
