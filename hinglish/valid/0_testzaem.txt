 Farmers put up to 20-25 kg, while only 4-5 kg of seed is sufficient to prepare its seed

 We look or do the same way, which fixes the microscopic genes hidden in our body to a large extent
 yahi nahin, jin maanav itihaas or bhavishya kii ore bhi sanket karte hai
 Gene scientists believe that once the structure of all the genes of mankind is detected, then it will be possible to predict all the biological events and somatic symptoms of life on the basis of the gene-horoscope of man
 yadhyapi yah koi aasaan kaam nahin he, kyonki maanav sharir main hajaaron lakhon jivit koshiken hotin hai
 This huge group of genes is called a genome
 aaj se lagbhag 136 varsh purv, bohemian bhikshuk grager jon mendal ne matar ke daanon par kiye apane prayogon ko prakashit kiya tha, jisamen anuvaanshiki ke adhyayan kaa ek nayaa yug aarambh hua tha
 From these articles onwards the rules of genetics were made
 unhone isamen ek nayi anuvaanshikeey ikai kaa naam jin rakhaa, tathaa iske pruthak hone ke niyamon kaa gathan kiya
 Thomas Hunt Morgan, doing research on Drosophila in 1910, proved that genes reside in the chromosome, in a straight line, and which genes are in which place on the chromosome can also be detected
 harman mular ne 1926 main khoj kii, ki drosophila ke jin main eksre se anuvaanshikeey parivartan ho jaataa he, jise utparivartan bhi kehete hai
 In 1944, it was proved that DNA is not a protein but a DNA
 san 1953 main watson or crik ne di en e kii sanrachana kaa pataa lagaaya or batya, ki yah do tantuon se bana hua ghumaavdaar seedhinuma, yaa dohari kundalini ke aakaar kaa hota he
 The entire genome of any animal is called a genome

 There is a nucleus inside each cell
 prayek kendrak ke andar dhaage ke aakaar kii sanrachanaayen hoti hai, jinhen gunasutra kehete hai
 Each nucleus has 46 chromosomes
 23 gunsutra pita se va 23 mata se aate hai
 These chromosomes are made up of proteins and nucleic acids
 jise di en e kehete hai
 The structural unit of a nucleic acid is a nucleotide
 jab ek koshika kaa vibhaajan hokar do koshikaayen banatin hai, tab unka jinom bhi duguna ho jaataa he
 At the time of cell division, both fibers of DNA are separated and a new complement of each fiber is formed by the rule of nucleotide pairing or base pairing
 atah prayek nayi koshika ke di en e main ek nayaa or ek purana tantu hota he
 The new filament that is formed by following the rule of base pairing is an exact copy of the old filament
 di en e chaar mul beson kaa bana hota he: The a of one fiber connects with the t of the other fiber, and the c of one fiber connects with the g of the other fiber
 ek di en e kaa tantu duusare kaa sampoorak hota he
 Therefore, if the sequence of one fiber is known, the other can be found
 in do tantuon ke bich hydrogen bandha hote hai, jo do beson ko jodate hai
 The specific sequence of different base pairs of DNA is called a gene
 vastutah jin hi anuvaanshikta kii bhautik va kayik ikai he
 This encodes information that directs protin synthesis
 aisa anumaan he, ki lagbhag ek se ded tak jin prayek koshika main hai, jo hamaare sharir ke sabhi kaaryon ko sampann karne main sakasham hai

 Someone once asked you how Hindus became such a large number of Muslims
 apane saat kaaran bataaye
 1
 Accidentally made a Muslim in a Muslim invasion 2
 musalamaani raaj main jar, joru va jameen dekar kai pratishthit hinduo ko muslmaan banaaya gaya 3
 Due to the degradation of Urdu, Persian education and Sanskrit in Islamic period
 4
 hinduon main punarvivaah na hone ke kaaran va sati pratha par roak lagane ke baad hindu aurato ne muslmaan ke ghar kii shobhaa badhai tathaa agar kisi hindu yuvak kaa muslmaan stri se sambandh hua to use jati se nikal kar muslmaan bana diya gaya
 5
 Many Hindus became heretics due to the practice of idolatry 6
 musalamaani veshyyo ne kai hinduon ko fansaa kar muslmaan bana diya 7
 Muslims became Muslims due to non-promotion of Vedic religion
 agar gaharaai se sochaa jaye to pandit ji ne hinduon ko jati raksha ke liye upaay bataa die hai, agar ab bhi nahin sudhare to hindu kab sudharege
 During Panditji's time, a new religion of Islam grew in Kadian, District Gurudaspur Punjab, which was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad
 islam ke maanane vaale mohammad sahib ko aakhri paigambar maanate hai, mirza ne apane aapako kabhi krishna, kabhi nanak, kabhi isa messiah kabhi islam kaa aakhri paigambar ghoshit kar diya tathaa apane naveen mat ko chalane ke liye nai nai bhavishyavaania or ilhamo kaa dhol peetane laga
 One example is taken from the book "that is our Krishna" written by Mirza, in this book - he has sent Nishkalanki avatar for the advancement and improvement of Hindus who have come in the exact era of which Krishna ji had given information from Pahile
 Have given us nishkalank avatar kaa naam mirza gulam ahamed hai jo kaadiyaan jila gurudaspur main prakat hue hai
 God has shown thousands of marks on his hand
 jo log un par imaan let hai unako khuda taala bada nur bakhshata hai
 Hears their prayers and removes the cast of people on their recommendation
 pratishtha detaa hai
 You should get Noor by reading their teachings
 If there is any doubt, then pray to God that God? If this person who declares to be from you and calls himself a clean avatar
 apni ghoshnaa main sachcha hai to uske maanane kii hame shakti pradaan kar or hamaare man ko is par imaan len ko khol de
 pun aap dekhege kii paramatma avashya aapako paroksh nishaanon se uski satyata par nishchay dilavaayega
 to aap satya hriday se meri or prerit ho or apni kathinaaiyon ke liye prarthana karaave allaah taala aapaki kathinaaiyon ko dur karegaa or muraad puri karegaa
 allaah aapke saath ho
 prishth 6,7
8 vahi hamaara krishna
 Pathakagan himself must have understood how Mirza was trying to fool innocent Hindus with his devious policies, but he did not turn his pulse on Pandit Lekhram like Ranveer
 pandit ji satya asaty kaa nirnay karne ke liye mirza ke aage teen prashn rakhe
 1
 First, Mirza ji learns to speak Sanskriti Sanskrit from his Ilhami Khuda and let the two well-qualified scholars of Aryasamaj, Pandit Devdat Shastri and Pandit Shyam ji Krishna Varma, plague the Sanskrit conversation
 2
 6 darshanon main se sirf teen ke aarsh bhashya milte hai
 If Mirza ji asks for the translation of the remaining three, i will accept Mirza's opinion
 3
 mujhe 20 varsh se bavasir kaa rog hai 
 yadi teen maas main mirza apni prarthana shakti se unhen thik kar de to main mirza ke paksh ko sweekaar kar loonga
 Pandit ji continued to write letters to him
 Being fed up, Mirza wrote that why do not we see miracles here? It was thought that neither Panditji's Qadian would come and Bala would be postponed
 But Panditji was firm in his tune and reached Kadian on Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's kothi
 do maas tak pandit ji qadian main rahe par mirza gulam ahamed koi bhi chamatkaar nahin dikhaa sakaa
 With this anger, Mirza started the propaganda against Aryasamaj, considering Aryasamaj and Pandit Lekhram as his arch enemies
 mirza ne brahine ahmadiya naamak pustak chanda maang kar chhapavai
 pandit ji ne uskaa uttar takazeeb brahine ahmadiya likhakar diya
 Mirza wrote the melodious spectacles Arya, which Pandit ji wrote by writing a reply to Khabte Ahmadiya
 Mirza made this prediction in the sunglasses Arya that within a year Panditji will be killed
 This prediction of Mirza turned out to be wrong and Pandit lived till 11 years after this

 On 6 March 1897, Panditji was working on the life character of Swami Dayanand in the house
 tabhi unhone ek angadaai lee ki us dusht ne pandit ji ko chura mar diya or bhaag gaya
 Pandit ji was taken to the hospital where he gave up his life at two o'clock in the night

 kuch vidwaanon ne yah mana he ki iskaa shashan kaal maatra do varsh rahaa parantu nilkantha shastri ne uskaa shashan kaal 194 i0pus0 se lekar 185 i0pus0 mana he
 However, it is clear that his reign was not very long
 parantu chota hote hue bhi shatakarni pratham kaa kaarykaal kuch drushtikonon se bada mahatvapurn he
 He was the first among the Satavahana rulers who named him by the word "shatkarni", beloved and popular among the rulers of this dynasty

 If the number of electrons is more than the proton, the ion has negative charge and is also called anion
 iske vipareet agar electron kii taadaad protone se kam ho to aayan main dhanatmak aavesh hota he or use dhanayan bhi kehete hai
 An electron and a proton have equal electric charge
 isaliye kisi aayan kaa awesh usamen maujuud protonon kii sankhya ko usamen maujuud electronon se ghataakar bataaya jaataa he
 If the number of protons is high then this charge is positive and if the number of electrons is high then this charge is negative

 Mogamma is a government building located in Cairo Egypt

 Earlier there used to be barracks of British army
 1945 main angrejon ke jane ke baad jab raja farukh ne in baiyrakon ko nasht karne kaa aadesh diya tab nayaa shahar or kshetra banane ke liye kai sari pariyojnaon ke prastaav mangaaye gayi
 One of these projects of 1945 was the idea of building a centralized, all-powerful administrative building
 iskaa nirmaan 1946 main shuru hua or 1949 main yah ban kar taiyaar ho gaya
 The architectural style of the building reflects modernity of the 1940s
 Such government buildings are found in New York, Buffalo, Paris
 yah bhawan soviet sangh se prabhavit nahin he jaisaa kii adhiktar log samajhate hai
 Also, this building was not built by the second President of Egypt, Gamal Abdal Nasir
 kyunki nasir bhawan ke banane ke kai saalon baad november 1954 tak misr ke netaa nahin bane the
 Mogamma is located to the south of Tahrir Chowk in the Cairo city area which was newly built at that time
 moghamma ek prashaskeey sarkari bhawan he jahaan sarkaar ke sabhi prashaskeey kaary kiye jate hai
 For example, people go here to get their various types of government papers, driving license, or important government documents like visa
 is bhawan main sarkaar ke kar prashasan vibhaag, agnishamak vibhaag, passport vibhaag hai
 This 14-storey building employs 18,000 government employees
 moghamma kaa dhaanchaa or sthapaty kala 1940 ke aadhunik vaastukala se prerit he jise misr ke vaastushashtri kamaal ismail ne banaaya tha
 The exterior appearance was not very important, the structure was centered on a centralized structure and the use of more space

 Mogamma has been featured in several Egyptian films, the most famous of which is al-irhab wal Kebab Al-irhab wal Kebab
 yah ek hasya film thi jisamen bhawan kii afasarshahi ek vyakti ko itnaa pareshaan kar detii he ki wo surakshakarmi kii bandook chin letaa he or bhawan par kabja karne va maujuud logon ko bandhak banane ke liye chal detaa he jise aatankwaadi mana jaataa he
 The film blames Mogamma and her bureaucracy for all the troubles of Egypt

 duryodhana badi khoti buddhi kaa manushya tha
 At the behest of Shakuni, he tried to kill Pandavo many times in his childhood
 yuvavastha main aakar jab guno main usase adhik shreshth yudhishthar ko yuvaraj bana diya gaya to shakuni ne laksh ke bane hue dhar main pandavon ko rakhkar aag lagaakar unhen jalaane kaa praytn kiya kintu vidura kii sahaayta se paanchon pandav apni mata ke saath us jalte hue ghar se baahar nikal gayi
 Yudhishthira became very popular among the people of Hastinapur due to his excellent qualities
 unke gunon tathaa lokapriyata ko dekhte huye bhishma pitamah ne dhritarashtra se yudhisthir ke rajbhishek kar dene ke liye kaha
 Duryodhana did not want Yudhishthira to be the king, so he told his father Dhritarashtra, "father! If Yudhishthira once attained the throne, then this kingdom will be of Pandavas' lineage forever and we Kauravas will have to remain their servants
 ” is par dhritarashtra bole, “vatsa duryodhana! yudhisthir hamaare kul ke santaanon main sabase bada he isaliye is rajya par usee kaa adhikaar he
 Nevertheless Bhishma and the subjects also want to make him king
 ham is vishay main kuch bhi nahin kar sakate
 After listening to Dhritarashtra's words, Duryodhana said, "father! i have managed it
 bas aap kisi tarah pandavon ko varanavat bhej den
 " duryodhana ne varanavat main pandavon ke nivas ke liye purochan naamak shilpi se ek bhawan kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha jo ki lakh, charbi, sukhi ghaas, munj jaise atyant jvalansheel padaarthon se bana tha
 Duryodhana had conspired to burn the Pandavas in that building
 dhritarashtra ke kehane par yudhisthir apni mata tathaa bhaaiyon ke saath varanavat jane ke liye nikal pade
 Vidur came to know about the conspiracy of Duryodhana
 atah ve varanavat jate huye pandavon se maarg main mili tathaa unase bole, “dekho, duryodhana ne tum logon ke rahane ke liye varanavat nagar main ek jvalansheel padaarthon ek bhawan banwaaya he jo aag lagate hi bhadak uthegaa
 Therefore, you must make a tunnel to reach the forest from inside the building so that you can protect yourself in case of fire
 main surang banane vaala karigar chupake se tum logon ke paas bhej doongaa
 You guys stay in that lacquer with great care
 ” In Varanavat, Yudhishthira built a secret tunnel with the help of an artisan sent by his uncle Vidur
 pandav nity akhet ke liye van jane ke bahaane apane chhipane ke liye sthaan kii khoj karne lage
 After spending a few days like this, one day Yadhishthira said to Bhimsen, “bhima! Now we should flee by burning the evil priest in this lacquer
 ” bhim ne usee raatri purochan ko kisi bahaane bulawaaya or use us bhawan ke ek kaksh main bandi bana diya
 After that, the building was set on fire and along with his mother Kunti and brothers escaped into the forest through the tunnel
 laakshagrih ke bhasma hone kaa samachar jab hastinapur pahunchaa to pandavon ko mara samaj kar vahaan kii praja atyant duhkhi hui
 All Kauravas including Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra also pretended to grieve and in the end they got the Pandavas cremated

 In this sense, credit is the balance amount that makes it possible for a firm to provide accounting information in relation to buying another firm at a price different from its face value
 jahaan adhigrahan kii tithi ko shuddh parisampattiyon kaa uchit mulya adhigrahan laagat se adhik hota he, to saakh nakaaratmak bhi ho sakati he
 Negative credit is considered as an extraordinary advantage to the extent that it exceeds the allocation for fixed assets

 Anyone buying this company will register $ 10 million in total acquired assets, with $ 1 million in physical assets and $ 9 million in credit
 In a private company, credit has no predetermined value before acquisition; By definition its quantity depends on two other variables

 anya vaigyanik anushasano kii tarah yah bhi anek prakaar ke gyaan, mat or pranaaliyon kaa sanshleshan he, jiskaa prayog vargeekaran ke kshetra main hota he
 The first step of any kind of biological analysis is the classification of it in a systematic way; Therefore, the first step in studying a plant, or animal, is its naming, classification and then description
 aajkal padap kii chaar lakh jatiyon se adhik jatiyaan gyaat hai
 These are sixty times greater than the time of Linnaeus
 prati varsh lagbhag 4,750 nai jatiyon kaa varnan hota he
 More than a million names have been given from 1763 to 1942 AD in plant groups called phenerogams and cryptougams, including synonyms and subcastes

 The names of more than two million castes, including the sub-castes, are known and about 10,000 new castes are described every year

 They are of the opinion that animals can be separated on the basis of their way of living, nature and physical size
 inhone pakshi, machhlee, hwel, keet aadi jantusamoohon kaa ullekh kiya he or chote samoohon ke liye colioptera or dyptera aadi shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya he
 The botanists of this time were ahead of Aristotle's ideology
 unhone sthaneey paudhon kaa safal vargeekaran kar rakhaa tha
 Brunfels and Bauhin were scientists on the successful path of plant taxonomy, but the experts of this time classifying animals were still working under Aristotle's ideology

 Animals from far away were studied and their offspring and family etc
 were studied

 Linnaeus created five such categories: prayek shrenee main ek athwa ek se adhik neeche str ke samooh sammilit hote hai or ve nimna shrenee banaate hai
 Similarly each successive category belongs to one or more higher category
 ye shreniyan prakritik prabhed kam karke ek vyapak pranali bana detii hai
 With the development of knowledge, the number of these categories increased
 jagat or varg ke bich sangh or gana tathaa vansh ke bich main kutumb naamak shreniyan jodi gai
 According to Linnaeus, the species is an alternative category, which includes geographical or individual variation
 is tarah ab nimna saat shreniyan ho gai hai : For a more accurate interpretation of the classification, these categories are also divided into other categories
 adhiktar mul naam ke pehle adhi athwa up upsargon ko jodakar in shreniyon kaa namakaran kiya gaya he
 For example, precepts and subgroups etc

 Only the primitive caste is used between ku tumb and dynasty
 kuch lekhakon ne, jaise simpasan, ne gana or varg ke bich sahagan naam kaa prayog kiya he
 In this way, the number of commonly used categories is presently as follows: vartmaan samay main 'anterrashtriya namakaran code' dwaara jeevon ke vargeekaran kii saat shreniyan paribhaashit kii gayi hai
 These categories are - Jagat, Sangha, class, Gana, clan, clan and caste
 In recent years, another level called domain has come into vogue which is placed above the 'world'

 Categories can also be created between the seven main categories, for which prefixes 'adhi-', 'sub-' or 'infra-' should be used

 The right / exemption given to a small group by the state or any other authority is called privilege
 sansadeey visheshadhikaar ve vishisht adhikaar hai jo sansad ke donon sadanon ko, uske sadasyon ko or samitiyon ko praapt he
 Privileges are given with the view that both the Houses of Parliament, its committees and members can function independently
 unki garima bani rahe parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki kanoon kii najaron main saadhaaran nagarikon ke mukaable main visheshadhikaar praapt sadasyon kii sthiti bhinn he
 As far as the enforcement of the statutes is concerned, the members are representatives of the people as well as ordinary citizens
 mul vidhi yah he ki sansad sadasyon sahit sabhi naagarik kanoon kii najaron main baraabar maane jane chahie
 The responsibilities that belong to other citizens also belong to them and perhaps there are some more as members
 sansadon kaa sabase mahatvapurn visheshadhikaar he sadan or uski samitiyon main puri swatantraaa ke saath apane vichaar rakhane kii chhot
 No action can be taken in any court of law in relation to anything said or given by a member of Parliament
 sansadeey visheshadhikaron kii suchiyaan taiyaar kii ja sakati hai
 In fact they have also been prepared but no such list is complete
 thode main kah sakate hai ki koi bhi vah kaam jo sadan ke, uski samitiyon ke yaa uske sadasyon ke kaam main kisi prakaar kii baadha daale vah sansadeey visheshadhikaar kaa hanan karata he
 For example, no member can be arrested not only when the House of which he is a member is in session or while the Parliamentary Committee of which he is a member is in the meeting, or both
 a joint sitting of the Houses is going on, or while a joint sitting of the two Houses is going on
 sansad ke adhiveshan ke prarambh se 40 din pehle or uski samaapti se 40 din baad yaa jabaki vah sadan ko aa rahaa ho yaa sadan ke baahar ja rahaa ho, tab bhi use giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 No civil or criminal legal 'summons' can be given, without the permission of the Speaker / Chairman, within the premises of Parliament
 adhyaksh / sabhapati kii anumati ke bina sansad bhawan ke andar kisi ko bhi giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Because in the premises of Parliament only the orders of the House of Parliament or the Speaker / Chairman are followed
 yahaan anya kisi sarkari praadhikari ke yaa sthaneey prashasan ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin hota
 Each House of Parliament is its own defender of privilege
 visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa sadan kii avmaananaa karne vaale ko bhartsana karke yaa taadna karke yaa nirdhaarit avadhi ke liye karawas dwaara dandit kar saktaa he
 In the case of its own members, the House can impose the other two types of punishment, that is, suspend and remove from service of the House, a member may be suspended from serving the House for a specified period
 kisi ati gambhir maamle main sadan se nikaala ja saktaa he
 The House may punish the offenders with imprisonment for a term which does not ordinarily exceed the duration of the session of the House
 jaise hi sadan kaa satravsaan hota he, bandi ko mukt kar diya jaataa he
 Due to the contempt of the House by the audience shouting slogans in the gallery and / or throwing advertisements, the two Houses have, from time to time, punished the offenders with imprisonment till the House adjourns on that day
 sadan kaa dandic kshetra apane sadanon tak or unke saamne kiye gaye aparaadhon tak hi simit na hokar sadan kii sabhi avmaananaaon par lagu hota he
 Whether contempt is done by members or by persons who are not members
 isse bhi koi antar nahin padataa ki aparaadh sadan ke bheetar kiya gaya he yaa uske parisar se baahar
 This power of the House to punish persons for breach or contempt of privilege of the House is the foundation of parliamentary privilege
 sadan kii aisi panrapara bhi rahi he ki sadan kaa visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa sadan kii avmaananaa karne ke doshi vyaktiyon dwaara spasht rup se or bina kisi shart ke dil se vyakt kiya gaya khed sadan dwaara sweekaar karar liya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the House generally decides not to take further action on such matters, given its dignity

 Srilal Shukla's personality was his example
 sahaj lekin satark, vinodi lekin vidwaan, anushasanpriya lekin arajak
 Shrilal Shukla was a scholar of English, Urdu, Sanskrit and Hindi
 shrilaal shukla sangeet ke shastreey or sugam donon pakshon ke rasik-marmajna the
 He was the chairman of the 'storytelling' function committee
 shrilaal shukla ji ne garibi jheli, sangharsh kiya, magar uske vilaap se lekhan ko nahin bharaa
 The new generation also reads them the most
 ve nai peedi ko sabase adhik samajhane or padhane vaale varisht rachanakaaron main se ek rahe
 People make theology to read and write
 shrilaal ji kaa likhnaa or padhanaa rukaa to swasthya ke gambhir kaarnon ke chalate
 Srilal Shukla's personality was very comfortable
 vah hameshaa muskuraakar sabakaa swaagat karte the
 But he used to say his words without any reason
 vyaktitv kii isi kubi ke chalate unhone sarkari seva main rahete hue bhi vyavastha par karaari chot karne vaali raag darbari jaisi rachana hindi sahitya ko di
 Sun of Soon Valley · Unknown Habitat · Ragdarbari · Man's Poison · Boundaries break unhone shivpalganj ke rup main apni adbhut bhashaa style, mithkeey shilp or deshaj muhaavaron se gadha tha
 This combination of tragedies and irony made 'rag Darbari' a great work, then this work made Srilal Shukla a great writer
 raag darbari vyangy he yaa upanyaas, yah ek shreshth rachana he, jisaki tasadeeq karodon pathakon ne kii he or kar rahe hai
 Works like 'saint of Vishrampur', 'sun of the Valley of the Sun' and 'yeh Mera Ghar Nahin' have proved to be perfect in literary criteria
 balki ‘vishrampur kaa sant’ ko swatantra bharat main satta ke khel kii shashakt abhivyakti tak kaha gaya tha
 Even after reading the raga court, its characters are seen around us
 shuklaji ne jab ise likhaa tha, tab ek tarah kii hataasha chaaron taraf najar aa rahi thi
 It was a period of disillusionment
 aise niraashaa bhare mahaul main unhone samaaj kii visangatiyon ko chutili style main saamne laayaa tha
 He was a great creator as well as a sensitive and humble person
 shrilaal shukla kii rachanaaon kaa ek bada hissaa gaanv ke jivan se sambandh rakhata he
 He has deeply analyzed the vast experience of rural life and the constantly changing landscape
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki shrilaal shukla ne jadon tak jaakar vyapak rup se samaaj kii chaan been kar, uski nabj ko pakadaa he
 That is why this rural world has been seen in his literature
 unke sahitya kii mul prishthbhumi gram samaaj he parantu nagareey jivan kii bhi sabhi chhaviyaan usamen dekhne ko milti hai
 Srilal Shukla while referring to his innate perception towards literature and life has said that - kathalekhan main main jivan ke kuch moolbhoot naitik mulyon se patibaddh hote hue bhi yatharth ke prati bahut aakrisht hoon
 But this notion of reality is not single, it is multi-layered and all its levels - spiritual, inner, physical etc
 are intricately embedded
 unki samgr rup main pahchaan or anubhuti kahin-kahin rachana ko jatil bhale hi banaae, par us samagrata kii pakad hi rachana ko shreshthata detii he
 Just as a human lives on many levels simultaneously, the identity of this totality also gives the composition a multiplicity
 shrilaal shukla kii sookshm or paini drushti vyavastha kii choti-se-choti vikruti ko bhi sahaj hi dekh leti he, parakh leti he
 He did not allow his writing to be focused only on politics
 shiksha ke kshetra kii durdasha par bhi unhone vyangy ksaa
 His first work 'dharmayuga' published in 1963 is based on the discrepancies in the field of education
 vyangy sangrah ‘angad kaa paanv’ or upanyaas ‘raag darbari’ main shrilaal shukla ne ise vistaar diya he
 The condition of many Sakari schools in the country is pathetic
 unke paas acha bhawan tak nahin he
 Somewhere, classes are run in tents, that is, there is also a lack of minimum facilities
 shrilaal shukla is par tippanee karte hue kehete hai ki - "the same is also with the Changamal Vidyalaya Intermediate College of 'rag Darbari', from where boys who have passed intermediate can only say on the basis of the building, which bird is the name of sanitary fitting
" hamane vilayati talim tak deshi parampara main pai he or isiilie hamen dekho, ham aaj bhi utane hi praakrit hai, hamaare itnaa pard lene par bhi hamaara peshaab ped ke tane par hi utarataa he
 " vidambnaa yah he ki aaj kal adhyaaapak bhi adhyapan ke alaava sab kuch karte hai
 Like Master Ragiram of 'raag Darbari', he teaches less in class and dedicates more time to his flour mill
 zyaadaatar shikshak mothiram hi hai, naam bhale hi kuch bhi ho
 They take tuitions, run shops and do a variety of personal business
 chaatro ko dene ke liye unke paas samay kahan bachataa he? Srilal Shukla through his literature has made a serious injury to contemporary situations
 ve kehete hai ki - 'today human society is responsible for its downfall
 aaj vah khulkar hans nahin saktaa
 One also has to resort to 'laughing club' to laugh
 shuddh hawa ke liye oxigen parlor janaa padataa he
 Close bottle water has to be drunk
 instant phud khaanaa padataa he
 To play, there is also a shortage of time to talk to each other
 ’ Overall, it can be said that there is a struggle of life in the literature of Srilal Shukla and his literature is associated with social concerns
