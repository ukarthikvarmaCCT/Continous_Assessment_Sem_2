 Prior to the Voyager mission discoveries, Jupiter's moons were arranged neatly in groups of four, based on the similarity of their orbital elements
 Later, the large number of new small outer moons complicated the picture
 The main six groups are now considered, although some of them are different from others

 kaha jaataa he ki yah pracheen sindhu-saraswati lipi se nikali lipi he
 People of Harappan culture used this script in addition to the Indus script, when Sanskrit language was also written in this script
 bhashavaigyanik drushti se devanagari lipi aksharatmak lipi maani jaati he
 Script development is considered to be the development of scripts at the "alphabetic" level, in contrast to the "pictorial", "emotional" and "emotional" scripts
 paashchaatya or anek bhartiya bhashavigyanvigyon ke mat se lipi kii aksharatmak avasthaa ke baad alphabetic avasthaa kaa vikaas hua
 The most developed stage is considered to be the phonetic script
 "devanagari" ko aksharatmak isliye kaha jaataa he ki iske varna- akshar hai- swar bhi or vyanjan bhi
 The consonants "a", "b", etc
 are recitation - are inaccurate
 ve keval dhvaniyaan nahin hai apitu saswar akshar hai
 Hence, there are alphabets like Greek, Roman etc
 parantu yahan yah dhyaan rakhane kii baat he ki bharat kii "brahmi" yaa "bharti" varnmaala kii dhvaniyon main vyanjanon kaa "panini" ne varnsamamnay ke 14 sutron main jo swaroop parichay diya he- uske vishay main "patanjali" ne yah spasht bataa diya he ki vyanjanon main saniyojit "akar" swar kaa upyog keval uccharan ke uddeshy se he
 It is not essentially a part of the varna
 is drushti se vichaar karte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki is lipi kii varnmaala tatvat: dhvanyatmak he, aksharatmak nahin
 The alphabet of Devanagari has 12 vowels and 34 consonants
 shunya yaa ek yaa adhik vyanjanon or ek swar ke mail se ek akshar banataa he
 The following vowels are given for modern Hindi
 sanskrit main inke uccharan thode alag hote hai
 In Sanskrit, Ai is a combination of two vowels and is spoken like "A-I" or "A-I"
 isi tarah ou "a-u" yaa "aa-u" kii tarah bolaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, these alphabets in Hindi and Sanskrit are also considered vowels: jab kisi swar prayog nahin ho, to vahaan par 'a' mana jaataa he
 The absence of a vowel is indicated by a plow or a pause
 jaise ki k kh g gh
 In Hindi, mainly from Arabic and Persian languages, to write in Devanagari, the letters below some characters are used
 kintu hindi main bhi adhikansh log nukton kaa prayog nahin karte
 Apart from this, nukes are also not used in writing Sanskrit, Marathi, Nepali and other languages in Devanagari
 ji kaa prayog mukhyatah pahari bhashaaon main hota he jaise kii dogri main "aansu" ke liye shabd he "adru"
 e and d in Hindi are not derived from Persian or Arabic, nor are they found in Sanskrit
 asal main ye sanskrit ke saadhaaran da or dha ke badale hue rup hai
 Devanagari numerals are written as follows: devanagari lipi main do vyanjan kaa sanyuktakshar nimna rup main likhaa jaataa he : In the Brahmi family scripts, the Devanagari script supports the most conjunctures
 devanagari 2 se adhik vyanjanon ke sanyuktakshar ko bhi samarthan detii he
 Chhandas font supports many conjuncts in Devanagari

 Acharya Vinoba Bhave was the author of many scripts of the world
 unki spasht dharna thi ki devanagari lipi bharat hi nahin, sansar kii sarvaadhik vaigyanik lipi he
 If it is practiced for all the languages of India, then all Indians will come very close to each other
 hindustan kii ekta main devanagari lipi hindi se hi adhik upyogi ho sakati he
 Anant Shayanam Iyengar even accepted the possibility of Devanagari for the South Indian languages
 seth govinddas ise rashtriya lipi ghoshit karne ke paksh main the
 Many people think that having multiple languages is not a problem in India, while their scripts are a big problem
 gandhiji ne 1940 main gujarati bhashaa kii ek pustak ko devanagari lipi main chhapavaya or iskaa uddeshy bataaya tha ki meraa sapana he ki sanskrit se nikali har bhashaa kii lipi devanagari ho
 Similarly Vinoba Bhave thought that- buddha samskruti se prabhavit kshetra nagari ke liye nayaa nahin he
 China and Japan treat hieroglyphs

 Being a vessel of Devvani, Devanagari can also go beyond India's borders and offer a suitable option for China and Japan
 bhartiya mul ke log sansar main jahaan-jahaan bhi rahete hai, ve devanagari se parichay rakhte hai, visheshkar marishas, surinam, fiji, gayana, trinidad, tubago aadi ke log
 In this way, the Devanagari script can not only bind all the provinces in India in love, but can also make 'bahujan Hitay, Bahujan Sukhay' and make different countries a more smooth and scientific One can claim the title of 'vishwa Nagari' in the twenty-first century by providing an alternative

 Devanagari can be the best option for many languages of the world as it gives complete freedom to speak
 duniya kii or kisi bhi lipi me yah nahi ho saktaa he
 The same would be true for Indonesia, Vietnam, Africa etc
 ashtaadhi ko dekhakar koi bhi samaj saktaa he kii duniya me isse acchhee koi bhi lipi nahin he
 If the world is biased, Devanagari would be the most accepted script of the world because it is completely scientific

 Devanagari was developed in the era when writing was done by hand, and rocks, palm leaf, parchment, bhojapatra, tamrapatra etc
 were used for writing

 Problems with writing of any script are expected to develop with the development of technology
 isi kaaran devanagari main bhi samay-samay par sudhaar yaa maanakeekaran ke prayaas kiye gayi
 After the attainment of national language status in the independence movements of India, many personal and institutional efforts were made for the development and standardization of the script

 In the main circuit, there may be short circuits between two phases, between a phase and a neutral, or between a phase and a meaning
 aise short circuiton kii bahut hi hai curent main pratifalit hone kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he or isliye aisi sthiti main matraadhik vidyutpravaah suraksha upkaran ko jaldi se sakriy kar diya jaataa he
 However, it is possible that there is a short circuit between neutral and ground conductors and between two conductors of the same phase
 Such short circuits can be dangerous, especially because they do not occur immediately in large-scale currents and therefore the probability of an immediate detection is very low
 sambhavit prabhaavon main shaamil hai ek circuit kii apratyaashit urjashiltaa jise pruthak rahanaa prakalpit tha
 To help minimize the negative effects of short circuits, power distribution transformers are designed so that leakage rebounds remain to a certain extent
 The leakage feedback helps to limit both magnitude and rate in the event of an increase in the rate of power shutdown

 Many stories go around the origin of Coorg, that is, Kodagu
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki kodegu shabd kii utpatti krodhadesa se hui he jiskaa arth hota he kadaava janajati kii bhoomi
 Some others believe that the word Kodagu is made up of two words - Kodha i
e
 Dena and Avwa i
e
 Mata, from which this place is considered dedicated to Mata Kaveri
 baad main kodegu ko kurg ke naam se janaa gaya
 If we look at the historical figures of Coorg, it is known that it was settled in the 8th century
 kurg main ganga vansh kaa shashan sabase pehle tha
 Later, the Kurg became the capital of many rulers and descendants like the Pandavas, Cholas, Kadambas, Chalukyas and Changlvas etc

 Different types of mountains are formed in different ways, like volcanic mountains are formed from volcanic ridges and block mountains are formed by cracks lying on the crust
 bhransh ke samay aasapaas kaa bhaag tuutakar neeche dhans jaataa he tathaa bich kaa bhaag parvat ke rup main upar uthaa rah jaataa he
 But large mountains are mostly formed of flaky rocks
 vishwa kii sarvocch parvamalas paratdaar parvaton kaa hi udhaaharan hai
 These layers have been formed by filling the soil in the soil structure
 bhu-abhinati main ekatra kiya gaya padaarth ek naram evam kamjor kshetra banaata he
 Due to the weight of the substance, the bottom of the ground plane is drifted downwards to keep the balance right
 is kamjor kshetra ke donon ore pracheen kathor bhukhand hote hai
 Due to the pressure from these plots, the material collected in the land gets twisted, then the contraction causes the mountains to be destroyed
 prithvi apni gurutvkarshan shakti ke dwaara samanta or sthayitv laati he
 Only heat is sometimes a barrier in this
 taap ke bad jane se padaarth athwa chattaanon main failaav tathaa taap ke ghat jane se sankuchan tathaa jamaav hota he
 The earth was in liquid form during the early period
 at: vartmaan prithvi kaa aakaar iske thande hone se bana he
 First, the top layer of the earth became solid due to frost, but the process of cooling down continued, so the bottom surface shrinked and separated from the top layer
 upree parat main gurutvkarshan shakti ke kaaran sankuchan utpann hua falat: parvat nirmaankari parvatan kaa janm hua
 An example of dried apple can be taken to understand this hypothesis
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki jaise jaise prithvi kii thande hone kii kriya dhimi hoti gai vaise vaise parvat nirmaankari kriyaayein bhi mand hoti gai
 According to Arthur Holmes's hypothesis of convection currents, the currents of heat in earth's womb run downward
 ye dharaayen bhupatal kii nimna tah main mudate samay sankuchan tathaa failte samay failaav utpann kar detii hai
 Therefore, instead of turning convection currents coming from two different directions, mountain-building forces are born
 parvatanirmaan ke liye nimnlikhit dashaayen aavashyak hai : 1
 Having two rigid fixed plots
 2
 iske bich main bhu-abhinati kaa hona jisamen padaarth bhukhndon se kshayatmak shaktiyon dwaara cat katkar jamaa hota rahe tathaa tali nirantar neeche ko dhansati rahe
 3
 The center of the middle body which has an impact on the bend
 argad kii pariklpana ke anusaar parvatanirmaan main do kathor bhukhndon main se ek agrapradesh tathaa doosraa prishthpradesh hota he
 According to this, the contraction of mountain formation takes place from one side only, and in it the forehead remains fixed and the contraction comes from the back
 argand ke anusaar europea parvatan main africa kaa prishthpradesh, europe ke agrapradesh kii ore khisakane laga jab ki europe kaa agrapradesh sthir thi
 Thus the nearly 1,000-mile-long section of the site shrunk, causing twists and cracks in the Tithys landform and the formation of the Alps Mountains in Europe
 cobar ke anusaar parvat-nirmaan-kriya main koi agrapradesh yaa prishthpradesh nahin hota he balki donon hi agrapradesh hote hai
 Both states move towards land realization
 isse donon ore mode padate hai, jo madhyapind ke donon ore ek duusare kii vipareet disha main hote hai
 There is a midpoint between them
 inke anusaar tithij bhu-abhinati main bhartiya tathaa asian agrabhagon se dabaav aayaa
 Thus, there was a twist on both sides in the land formation, which led to the formation of the south coastal Himalayan ranges and northern ranges
 bich ke madhya pind se tibet ke pathaar kaa nirmaan hua
 The following are the stages of mountain origin and development: 1
 bhu-abhinati kaa hona, jisamen padaarth jamaa hota rahe tathaa saath hi tali nirantar neeche dhansati rahe
 2
 The rise of matter by continental constructive forces
 3
 parvat na shaktiyon ke dwaara padaarth main mode padana
 4
 Excessive impact of lateral forces and excess of turns
 parvatanirmaan kii antim avasthaa - parvaton kaa upar uthanaa, atyadhik mode ke kaaran daraaren padana, parshv se atyadhik dabaav ke kaaran toote padaarth kaa dur jaakar girnaa
 Vikram Bhatt is a director of Hindi films
 mulyamimasaa darshan kii ek shakha he
 Pricemimamsa is the Hindi version of the English word "agiology"
 "agxyology" shabd "exius" shabd unani shabd "exius" or "lagas" kaa arth mulya yaa keemat he tathaa "lagas" kaa arth tark, siddhant yaa mimasaa he
 Therefore, "agiology" or denomination refers to that science
 jiske antargat mulya swaroop, prakaar or uski tathvik satta kaa adhyayan yaa vivechan kiya jaataa he
 An object can have two sides - the fact and its value
 tathy par vichaar karnaa us vastu kaa varnan kehalaayegaa or uske mulya kaa nirupan uskaa gunadashaaran
 a decision about value is made by a person by comparing it to an ideal
 hamaare sabhi anubhavon main mulyon maapdand hi hote hai
 The evaluation of sunder-asundar in aesthetics, the evaluation of melody and simplicity in music, literature and art and the preservation of values in religion are all accepted but at the same time it is also worth noting that ethics, sociology, economics, politics In science, too, only the problems of values are considered
 mulyamimasaa ke antargat in sabhi shastron or vigyaanon ke mulyon kaa alag vivechan nahin kiya jaataa varan in sarvyaapee mulyon ke swaroop or prakruti par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 In this way, in the modern era, value-making has become a branch of philosophy and is growing rapidly
 mulya kaa taatpary kisi mulya kaa bhav ho saktaa he yaa uskaa abhaav ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, one can be price neutral instead of price or absence
 "mulya" shabd kaa prayog inamen se kisi bhi sthiti ke liye ho saktaa he
 That is why it is not more rational to call pricemaking a science of value
 phir bhi saamaanya rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki jis prakaar aachaar shaastra kaa vivechan sahi or galat par kendrit rahata he vaise hi mulyamimasaa kaa vivechan praaia: achche or bure se sambandhit hota he
 In Western philosophy, the evolution of valueism coincided with Plato's suffix theory and Aristotle's development in ethics, politics, and philosophy
 stoic or epicurian logon ne jivan ke ucchadarsh khoje
 Christian philosophers tried to identify Aristotle's highest value with God
 aadhunik darshanikon ne swatantra rup se vibhinn mulyon kaa swaroop nirdhaaran kiya
 Kant first discussed deeply about the values of beauty and religion

 mulyamimasaa ke antargat mukhyat: mulya kaa swaroop, mulya ke prakaar, mulya kaa bhav siddhant or mulya ke tathvik sanstaran kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Philosophers have conceptualized the form of value in various ways
 spinoja aadi ne usee ko mulya mana he jisase kisi ichha kii tripti hoti he
 Epicurus, Bentham, Meenang etc
 consider the hedonistic philosophical pleasure as the only value
 mulya kaa swaroop peri kii drushti main abhiruchi, martinu ke vichaar se variyata, stike, kaant or rais ke liye shuddh tarksangat ichha, tii0 ech0 green ke liye vyaktitv ke ekatv kaa saamaanya anubhav he; nitshe or anya utkrantivaadee usee anubhav ko mulya maanate hai jo jivan ke vikaas main kisi prakaar sahaayak ho
 Some philosophers such as Spinoza, Lötz or DV etc
 consider the fruitful value as personal
 uski swatantra satta nahin he
 It depends on the person's interest, disinterest and his mental state and needs
 iske vipareet layerd, moore aadi manishi mulya ko rup, ras, gandh kii bhanti vishaygat maanate hai
 Alexander's position is in the middle of both these opinions
 vyakti, jo mulya kaa anubhav karata he or vastu jiske mulya kaa anubhav kiya jaataa he, donon ke sambandh main hi mulya kaa astitv he
 Separately or independently of the relation of person and thing, value cannot be achieved in any one of the two
 e0 ji0 ir ko taarkik bhavvaadi drushtikon he, isaliye ve mulya ko arthhin kehete hai
 There are different types of prices
 unka kai prakaar se vibhaajan kiya ja saktaa he
 Often philosophers distinguish between inward and outward values
 antarvarti mulya kaa swatantra rup se apane liye hi mulya hota he
 Attempts to attain these values are not made because they can serve some other purpose
 vastut: in mulyon ko paa lenaa hi antim lakshya hota he
 Externalities are just a means or instruments to achieve intrinsic values
 ek ore aise vedanti hai jinka vishwaas he ki nirgun bahyarup main antarvarti mulya kii hi antim satta he, uske atirikt sabhi bahirvarti mulya hai jo bhranti maatr he
 On the other hand there are those who support mechanistic theory and refute the intrinsic values
 dwaitvaadi mulyamimasak antarvarti or bahirvarti donon prakaar ke mulyon kaa astitv maanate hai
 One is eternal and the other mortal, most of the philosophers accept this principle very slightly
 kuch antarvarti mulyon ko pradhanta dete he or bahirvarti mulyon ko unke adhinsth maanate hai
 Some people prioritize outbound values and consider inward values to be the origin or outcome of outlier values
 kuch darshanik aise bhi hai jo sabhi vastuon main donon prakaar ke mulya aprihaary rup se maanate hai
 They do not deny that one is dominant and the other is dominant
 kintu aisi koi vastu nahin he jisamen shuddh antarvarti yaa bilkul bahirvarti mulya hi hon
 In general, auspicious, true, Shiva, beautiful and holy are considered intrinsic values
 kuch log inke saath daihik kalyaan, sambandh, kaary or krida ko bhi antarvarti mulya maan lete hai
 From the point of view of Montague, truth cannot be properly valued, because some truth is valueless and something neutral means that there is no question of not having value in it
 dharmik mulyon ke sambandh main bhi darshanikon main matbhed he
 Some people consider it to be a special kind of value and some people consider it to be a special kind of attitude towards other values
 mulya kaa maap siddhant manovaigyanik ho saktaa he or taarkik bhi
 Theistic philosophers measure the value with pleasure
 erestipus vyakti ke sukh or bentham samaaj ke sukh kaa mulya ko maapdand maanate hai
 Bentham discovered such pleasures in which happiness can be measured by determining the depth, stability, certainty, closeness, usefulness, purity, etc
 of happiness
 yah mulya ke maapan kaa manovaigyanik prayaas he
 Martineau and Brentons consider it possible to measure value from the inside
 kuch aadhyatmavaadiyon ne vastugat adarsh nishchit kar rakhe hai or unheen se tulana karke mulyon kaa maapan karte hai
 Some philosophers justify the attribution of value only in society and harmony
 prakrutivaadee darshanik jaivik vikaas or vaataavaran se samanjan ko mulya kii maap maanate hen
 The object, action or situation in which an organism develops at a more rapid pace has a higher value, on the contrary, those who have an obstacle in life are not valued
 mulya kaa tathvik sanstaran nirdhaarit karte samay charmatatv se uskaa sambandh nishchit kiya jaataa he
 If the basic element is true, then what is its relation to value? There are mainly three principles in this regard - individualist, rationalist and materialistic
 vyaktivaadee mulya ko maanvi anubhav se sambhddha or ashrith maanate hai
 Value is the origin of one's mind
 vastu se uskaa sambandh nahin he
 a person imposes value in an object according to his or her fulfillment
 ""priyo-priy upekshyaschetyakaara manigrasy:, sristaa jivairishasristan rupan saadharana mishu"" priy, apriy or upeksha karne yogya mani ke teen aakaar jivarchit hai tathaa uskaa saadhaaran manirup ishwar nirmit he
 Beloved, unpleasant and neglectful feelings vary from person to person, are definitely creations of one's mind
 sukhwadi, bhavvaadi or prakrutivaadee bhi isi se milte-julate maton kaa samarthan karte hen
 Objectivists refute this theory
 ve mulya ko maansik rachana maatr nahin maanate hai
 Value has independent existence in the object
 vyakti us mulya ko pahichaane na pahichaane, phir bhi vah apana astitv surakshit rakhata he
 Not all Objectists have a single opinion
 kuch vastuvaadi mulya kaa taarkik vishleshan karte hai or taarkik vastuvaadi kehalaate hai
 Some materialists determine the value from an elemental point of view
 ve tathvik vastuvaadi kahe ja sakate hai
 Because of not considering the rational materialistic value as Manas composition, consider it as an essence or a substance
 vah vastu main rahete hue bhi koi aisi swatantra satta nahin rakhata jo vastu yaa sat par koi prabhaav daal sake yaa parivartan kar sake
 Here a clear distinction between truth and value is kept
 tathvik vaastuvaadi mulya kii tathvik yatharthata sweekaar karte hen or us sat kaa hi ek ang maanate hai

 Following a briefing by Lieutenant General Daniel O
 Graham, Max Hunter, and Jerry Pournelle, Quail resulted in the creation of DC / X, which sponsored the x-program, an experimental single-stage development for the class Flyer and White Sands
 During his time as vice-president, Dan Quail, who was tested on his vice-presidency, Quail was widely ridiculed in the media and by many in the general public
 ountries
throughout 47 made a government affair both in the US and abroad, an intellectual mild and generally incompetent

 In his response, he made a series of scientifically incorrect statements

 "during the 1992 presidential campaign, Quail told the news media that homosexuality was an option, and was believed to be" the wrong choice
 " "potatoe" On June 15, 1992, Quail changed the correct spelling of 12-year-old student William Figueroa of "potato" to "potatoe" at the MUNOZ RIVERA Elementary School Spelling Bee in New York, New Jersey
 queyal vyapak rup se apni galati ke liye fatkaar lagaai gai thi
 According to the Memoirs of the New York Times and Quail, Quail's claim that he relied on cards provided by the school included misspellings
 queyal unhone kaha ki vah diya sanskaran ke saath asahaj tha, lekin vah skool ke galat likhit saamagree ke bajaay apane khud ke faisle par bharosa karne ke liye faisla kiya he kyonki aisa kiya tha
 Murphy Brown: On May 19, 1992, Quail gave a speech on the subject of the riots in Los Angeles for the Commonwealth Club of California entitled Urban America
 is bhaashan main queyal america samaaj main ek naitik mulyon kaa kshay or parivaar ke dhaanche par hinsa ko doshi tehraaya
 In one way, she doesn't help when it matters that prime-time TV is Murphy Brown, saying "how it contributed to" poverty of values "as an example of popular culture as a mother in the television program Murphy Brown, the title character Cited - a character who is believed to be the epitome of today's intelligent, high-paying, professional woman

 In 2002, Candice Bergen, the actress who played Brown, never really said much about the entire episode, which was infinite, but her speech fathers being insignificant and a whole lot about no one The kind of intelligent speech i agreed with more than that was said "
 " dusron ko ise alag tareeke se vyakhya kii; gayak tanya vyapak rup se yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya tha "narak daan queyal ekal maataaon ke baad aane ke liye koun he?" 1992 election: During the 1992 election, Bush and Quail challenged Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and Tennessee Senator Al Gore in their bid for reelection by the Democratic ticket, as well as the independent ticket of Texas businessman Ross Perot, and Admiral James Stokdell Were retiring
 bush agast 1992 republican neshnal kanvension, kuch republican ranneetikaron purvavarti saptaah main chunaav main lagged ke rup main tikat ke liye ek daayitv ke rup main queyal dekhi or uske pratisthaapan ke liye dhakka diya
 Quail and survived safely

 His claims were later criticized by the liberal group Fair for inaccuracy, although Quail criticized Gore's book Earth in equilibrium with the reference to the special page
 queyal ke samaapan tark teji se "kya tum sach main bill clinton sachai bataa denge vishwaas karte ho?", matadaataaon se poocha or "aap bill clinton apane adhyaksh par bharosa karte hai?", gore or stokdale ve samarthan nitiyon or darshan ke bare main adhik baat kii thi, jabaki
 Republican party loyalists were largely relieved and happy with Quail's performance, and attempted to portray the vice-president's camp as a troubled victory against a Veteran's debate
 haalanki, baad kii bahes chunaav gore, stokdale yaa queyal jeeta tha par ki kya milaayaa gaya
 This eventually proved to be a minor factor in the election, which Bush and Quail later lost

 duusare shabdon main, brands ke bare main upabhoktaaon kaa gyaan, nirmaataaon / vigyapakon ko alag tareeke se pratikriya dene yaa brands ke marketing ke liye bilkul sateek or kushal yuktiyon ko apnaane ke liye prerit karata he
 The study of brand equity is becoming increasingly popular, as some researchers have concluded that its most important asset for any company is its brand
 brands ko maapne ke kai tareeke hai
 Some methods of measurement are at the business level, some at the product level and others at the consumer level
 vyavsaay str: vyavsaay str ke tareeke main brands ko ek vittiya sampatti ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 In short, it is calculated as to what this brand is worth as an intangible asset
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar aapako vyavsaay kaa mulya maapna ho, to bazaar main lagi puunji ke anusaar uskaa jo mulya he - usamen se moort sampattiyon or "maapne yogya" amoort sampattiyon ko ghataane par -jo shesh bachaa he wo brands equity hoga
 vyavsaay str par maapan ke tareeke kaa ek ucch stareey udhaaharan he- vyavsaay ke interbrands kaa paraamarsh
 isaki gananaa karne ke liye, interbrands dwaara anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki vartmaan mulya kii tulana pryojit laabh se karen to is aadhaar par brands mulya kya hoga
 chhot kii dar ek vyaktiparak dar he joki interbrands waal street equity visheshgyon dwaara tay kii jaati he tathaa jokhim ke str, bazaar netritv, sthirataa or brands kii vaishvik pahunch ko darshaati he
 Product Level: An ideal example of product level brand measurement is to compare the price of an unnamed or privately labeled product to the value of a branded product of the same 'quality'
 Despite everything being the same, the price difference is due to its brand
 haal hi main ek aay adhimulya drushtikon kii vakaalat kii gai he
 Consumer level: In this way, the consumer's mind is read out to find out the reasons for which he is associated with that particular brand
 is tareeke se jaagrukta or brands chhavi ko mapa jaataa he
 Free engagement testing and objective techniques are commonly used to identify the tangible and intangible qualities, attitudes and intentions of a brand
 jin brands ke bare main jaagrukta zyada ho or upabhoktaaon se unka judav majboot, anukool or anokhaa ho wo oonchi equity vaale brands hote hai
 All these calculations result in almost the same even if done best
 brands kii behatar or puri samaj paidaa karne ke liye inamen se kai tareekon kaa ek saath prayog karnaa zyada kargar hota he
 An interesting question is raised - can brand equity be negative? From one perspective, brand equity cannot be negative
 Positive brand equity is created by effective marketing, advertising, public relations and promotion
 ek doosraa pariprekshya ye he ki nakaaratmak equity ho sakati he
 If we look at the example of a political "brand", a "democrat brand" can be negative for a 'republican' and similarly a 'republican' brand can be negative for a 'democrat'
 ek company kii brands equity jitani zyada hoti he utani adhik sambhaavna he wo parivaar branding ranneeti kaa prayog vyakti branding niti kii tulana main zyada karegi
 iskaa kaaran yah he parivaar branding unhen pramukh brands main jamaa equity main or sudhaar karne kii anumati detaa he
 Aspects of brand equity include: loyalty to the brand, awareness, engagement and people's perception of its quality

 An analyst at Toronto Star received a warning that freestaring the well-known name Windstar would lead to confusion and that the brand equity built would go waste, while the marketing manager believed that the new design of the car would be noticed by the public
 
 The old Taurus, which had become the most important car in American auto history, was to be replaced with three brand new names starting with 'F' - Five Hundred, Freestar and Fusion
 2007 tak freestar kaa pratisthaapan kiye bina use band kar diya gaya
 The name Five Hundred was dropped and Torus was brought back for the next generation of cars, a decision casually taken by Ellen Mulelli

 As many sages and sages and sages came to the guest house, Kunti used to serve them diligently
 ek baar vahaan durvasa rishi aa pahunche
 Kunti also served them diligently
 kunti kii seva se prasann ho kar durvasa rishi ne kaha, “putree! main tumhaari seva se atyant prasann hua hoon atah tuje ek aisa mantra detaa hoon jiske prayog se tu jis devtaa kaa samaran karegi vah tatkaal tere samaksh prakat ho kar teri manokamana purna karegaa
 Thus Durvasa went after providing a mantra to the sage Kunti
 ek din kunti ne us mantra kii satyata kii jaanch karne ke liye ekaant sthaan par baith kar us mantra kaa jaap karte huye suryadev kaa samaran kiya
 At that moment Suryadev appeared there and said, "devi! Tell me what you desire from me

 "kunti said," o God! i do not have any type of expectation from you
 maine to keval mantra kii satyata parakhane ke liye hi uskaa jaap kiya he
 Hearing these words of Kunti, Suryadev said, "O Kunti! My visit can not go waste
 main tumhen ek atyant parakramee tathaa daansheel putr pradaan karata hoon
 Saying this, Suryadev became intractable

 dronacharya us samay kuru rajkumaron ko shiksha diya karte the
 He refused to teach Karna as Karna was a charioteer and Drona only taught Kshatriyas
 dronacharya kii asammati ke uparant karn ne parashuram se sampark kiya jo ki keval brahmanon ko hi shiksha diya karte the
 Karna, calling himself a Brahmin, requested Parasurama for education
 parashuram ne karn kaa aagrah sweekaar kiya or karn ko apane samaan hi yudhkala or dhanurvidya main nishnaat kiya
 Karna was cursed by his guru Parashurama and Prithvi Mata
 karn kii shiksha apane antim charan par thi
 One afternoon, Guru Parshuram was resting on Karna's thigh
 kuch der baad kahin se ek bichchhu aayaa or uski duusari jangha par kaat kar ghaav banane laga
 Karna used to bear the sting by not removing the scorpion so that the rest of the Guru is not disturbed
 kuch der main guruji kii nidra tuuti or unhonen dekha kii karn kii jaangh se bahut rakt bah rahaa he
 He said that only a Kshatriya could have such tolerance to bear a scorpion sting, not in a Brahmin and Parshuramji cursed him due to a false speech that whenever Karna would need his education most, That day it won't work for him
 karn, jo ki swayan ye nahin jaanata tha ki vah kis vansh se he, ne apane guru se kshamaa maangi or kaha ki uske sthaan par yadi koi or shishy bhi hota to wo bhi yahi karata
 Although Karna was enraged at cursing him with anger, he could not take back his curse
 tab unhonen karn ko apana vijay naamak dhanush pradaan kiya or use ye aashirwad diya ki use vah vastu milegi jise vah sarvaadhik chahta he - amit prasiddhi
 In some folklore, it is believed that Indra himself, in the form of a scorpion, wanted to reveal his true Kshatriya identity
 parashuramji ke ashram se jane ke pashchaat, karn kuch samay tak bhatakta rahaa
 During this time he was learning 'shabdhedi' lore
 abhyaas ke dauraan usne ek gaay ke bachade ko koi vaneey pashu samaj liya or us par shabdabhedi baan chalaa diya or bachhda maaraa gaya
 Then the Brahmin, the lord of the cow, cursed Karna that just as he killed a helpless animal, one day he would also be killed when he would be most helpless and when all his attention was focused on something other than his enemy

 Karna lived in the shelter of Duryodhana
 guru dronacharya ne apane shishyon kii shiksha puri hone par hastinapur main ek rangabhumi kaa aayojan karavaaya
 In Rangbhoomi, Arjuna became a disciple with special archery
 tabhi karn rangabhumi main aayaa or arjuna dwaara kiye gaye kartabon ko paar karke use dwandvayuddh ke liye lalakaara
 When did Kripacharya reject Karna's duel and ask him about his dynasty and empire - because according to the rules of the duel only a prince could dare Arjuna, the prince of Hastinapur, for a duel
 tab kauravon me sabase jyeshtha duryodhana ne karn ko angaraj ghoshit kiya jisase vah arjuna se dwandyudh ke yogya ho jaae
 When Karna asks Duryodhana what he wants from him in return, Duryodhana says that he only wants Karna to become his friend
 is ghatana ke baad mahabharat ke kuch mukhya sambandh sthapit hue, jaise duryodhana or karn ke bich sudrudh sambandh bane, karn or arjuna ke bich teevr pratidwandvita or pandavon tathaa karn ke bich vaimnasy
 Karna was a loyal and true friend of Duryodhana
 yadhyapi vah baad main duryodhana ko khush karne ke liye dyutakrida main bhagidaari karata he, lekin vah aarambh se hi iske viruddh tha
 Karna did not like Shakuni and always recommended Duryodhana to use his fighting skills and muscle to defeat his enemies and not devious tricks
 jab laakshagrih main pandavon ko maarane kaa prayaas vifal ho jaataa he, tab karn duryodhana ko uski kaayarta ke liye daantata he or kahata he ki kaayron kii sabhi chaalen vifal hi hoti hai or use samajhaata he ki use ek yoddha ke samaan kaary karnaa chahie or use jo kuch bhi praapt karnaa he, use apni veerta dwaara praapt kare
 Karna also assisted Duryodhana in marrying the princess of Chitrangad
 apane swayamvar main usne duryodhana ko asweekaar kar diya or tab duryodhana use balpurvak uthaa kar le gaya
 Then the other kings present there followed him, but Karna single-handedly defeated them all
 parrast raajaaon main jaraasandh, shishupal, dantavakr, salve or rukmi ityadi the
 As a compliment to Karna, Jarsandha gave Karna a portion of Magadha
 bhim ne baad main shrikrishna kii sahaayta se jaraasandh ko parrast kiya lekin usase bahut pehle karn ne use akele parrast kiya tha
 Karna had also revealed the weakness of Jarasandha that his death can only be done by splitting his torso into two pieces
 sukhsagar ke saujany simahabharat ek itihaas he
 But Brahmins distorted due to business, think to yourself- 1- Is the sun able to come to earth and produce a child? The sun is not a human, a burning ball of fire, a piece of which can create a ruckus on the earth
 2- kya channdra, aadi grah dharti par aakar baccha paidaa karne me samarth he? phir karn, indraputra arjuna, aadi kaise sambhav he
 The alleged Indra gods never appeared in India's written history for thousands of years
 mujhe koi bataaye indradev akbar, vikramaditya, sikandar, hitler, nepolian aadi shaskaon ke kaal main kab aaye? isi tarah naarad muni in kaalon main aanse laapata rahe jaise gadhe ke sir se sing

 Salahuddin Owaisi, father of Asaduddin Owaisi, was also a politician
 vah do dashak se bhi adhik tak hyderabad ke saansad rahe
 Owaisi was born on 13 May 1969 to Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi and Najmunessa Begum
 vah hyderabad ke ek raajnneetik parivaar se aata he
 His grandfather Abdul Wagh Owaisi reintroduced the political party majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen as All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen on 18 September 1957

 unki sabase badi beti 24 march 2018 ko nawab shah alam khan or dow
 moinuddin khan sandosai ke pota barkat alam khan se sagaai hui thi
 His supporters welcomed him as nakib-e-millat
 kai tippaneekaron ne ovaisi ko jinna kii tulana kii
 According to Patrick French, Owaisi appeals to a "non-sectarian Muslim identity" in a way similar to Jinnah's bid to be the sole spokesperson of the Muslim community
 unka rashtrawaad ke saath islamvaad kaa brands hyderabad puraane shahar or mumbai main muslim yuvakon ke kattarpanth ke sambhavit kshetron main panapata he
 Owaisi cited the fact that his fight was within the framework of the Indian Constitution
 unka kahana he ki bharat kii dharmanirpeksh partiyaan apane voton ko muslim ummidavaaron ko sthanantarit karne main sakasham nahin hai
 Of the 23 Muslim mps elected in 2014, 18 or 30% of the 19 constituencies were Muslim voters
 jabaki partiyaan musalamaanon ke khilaaf bhedbhaav nahin karne kaa daawa karti hai, ve pratha main musalamaanon ko "yahudee basti kii sthiti" main chhod dete hai
 Therefore, Muslims should develop their own political party, similar to obcs, Dalits and Yadavs

 Owaisi says there is an argument to use the money for the education of Muslim women on religious pilgrimage to visit Mecca to eradicate the Haj subsidy to Indian Muslims
 july 2016 main, ovaisi ko yah sweekaar karne ke liye unke bhaashan ke liye prashansa kii gai ki islamic rajya iraq or levent musalamaanon ke bich ek samasya he or unhen narak ke kute kehete hai
 Owaisi said in his speech, which was given to monitor what is being said from some mosques after the 2016 Saudi Arabia bombing, and who is injecting radical poison
 agast 2016 main asaduddin ovaisi ne bharat kii janaganana 2011 main twits kii ek shrinkhalaa main ahmadiya samudaay ko islam ke ek sampradaay ke rup main shaamil karne ke liye centre main apni naaraazgi vyakt kii
 In April 2017, on the issue of ban on cow slaughter, Owaisi criticized the BJP for being Dalit in treating cow as sacred as cow in Uttar Pradesh and North Indian states, but not holy in Northeast, Goa and Kerala Was
 ovaisi ne kaha ki muslim purush apni patni ko talaak ke bina turant talek ke madhyam se talaak de rahe hai, unka saamaajik rup se bahishkaar hona chahie, lekin kaha ki yah abhyaas abhi bhi maujuud he
 Owaisi is in controversy and due to his politics, the news is mainly concentrated among minorities like Muslims and Dalits
 ovaisi ne apane chote bhai akbaruddin ovaisi ke saath 2005 main madak jila colector ke haathon se nipatane ke aaropon ke liye maamla darj kiya tha

 In 2009, a case was registered against Owaisi on the orders of the Election Commission of India for backing and beating Saeed Salimuddin, a polling agent of the Telugu Desam Party in the Mughalpura region
 march 2013 main, karnataka ke bidar main bina license ke bina raily ke aayojan ke liye unhen bandook le jane ke liye hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 In June 2014, Owaisi called for hatred against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for demanding the support of the Muslim community
 7 farvari 2016 ko, ovaisi ne hyderabad police ke samaksh aatmasamarpan kar diya or baad main ek bheed dwaara hamalaa karne ke liye jamaanat di, jise usne kathith taur par netritv kiya, telugana bhartiya rashtriya congress vidhayakon ke khilaaf kiya
 His close cooperation Sayeed Abduhah Kashif and the social media head of the AIMIM party attacked Congress MLC and Leader of the Opposition Shabir Ali
 march 2016 main, maharashtra main ek saarvajanik raily ko sambodhit karte hue, ovaisi ne kaha ki ve rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pramukh mohan bhagwat kii tippanee ke jawaab main bharat mata kii jai kabhi nahin kahenge ki nai peedi ko jap karne ke liye sikhaaya janaa chahie 2016 kii jeenyu rajdroh vivaad kaa zikr karte hue bharat kii maa kaa jaijyakaar karne vaale naare
 Owaisi said, "whom is he trying to intimidate Bhagwat? He cannot force his ideology on others
 samvidhan main kahin nahin kahata he ki ek ko 'bharat mata kii jai' kaha janaa chahie
 He later clarified that he has no problem with the slogan 'bharat Mata Ki Jai', but he has no objection with the RSS, which slogan as a test of patriotism tiruchirapalli vimaanashetra bharat ke tiruchirapalli shahar main sthit hawaii adda he

 Tilka Manjhi alias Jabra Pahadia is the Adividrohi of India
 duniya kaa pehla adividrohi rome ke purakhaa adivasee ladaaka spartacas ko mana jaataa he
 While in the history of India's colonial wars, the credit for being the first Adivasi goes to the fighters of the Pahariya primitive tribal community who fought the British rule in the hills of Rajmahal, Jharkhand
 in pahadiya ladaakon main sabase lokapriy adividrohi zebra yaa jorah pahadiya urf tilka maanjhi hai
 Jabra Pahadia was a heroic Adivasi of Pahadia community challenging the British power in India
 singarasi pahaad, pakur ke zebra pahadiya urf tilka maanjhi ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki unka janm 11 farvari 1750 i
 main hua tha
 From 1771 to 1784, he fought a long and never surrender battle against the British power and kept the sleep of the local nobles-feudal and English ruler
 pahadiya ladaakon main sardaar ramana ahaadi or amadapada prakhand ke aamgaachhi pahaad nivasee kariya puzhar or singarasi pahaad nivasee zebra pahadiya bharat ke adividrohi hai
 Spartacus, the ancestral tribal warrior of Rome, is considered to be the world's first abolitionist
 bharat ke aupniveshik yudhon ke itihaas main jabaki pehla adividrohi hone kaa shrey pahadiya aadim adivasee samudaay ke ladaakon ko jaataa hai jinhone rajmahal, jharkhand kii pahadiyon par britani hukumat se loha liya
 The most popular among these Pahadia fighters is the Adividrohi Jabra or Zaurah Pahadia aka Tilka Manjhi
 inhone 1778 i
 main pahadiya saradaaron se milakar ramgarh camp par kabja karne vaale angrejon ko khaded kar camp ko mukt karaayaa
 In 1784, Jabra killed Cleveland
 baad main irkut ke netritv main zebra kii gorilla sena par jabardast hamalaa hua jisamen kai ladaake maare gaye or zebra ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 It is said that he was dragged in four horses and dragged to Bhagalpur
 par milon ghasite jane ke baavjood vah pahadiya ladaaka jivit tha
 His body drenched in blood was still angry and his red eyes were scaring the British Raj
 bhay se kaanpate hue angrejon ne tab bhagalpur ke chauraahey par sthit ek vishaal vatvriksh par saream lataka kar unki jaan le lee
 In front of a crowd of thousands, Jabra Pahadia aka Tilka Manjhi hung on the gallows
 taarikh thi sambhawatah 13 janvari 1785
 Later thousands of freedom fighters followed Jabra Pahadia and sang the songs that were hanging on the gallows - Hansi - Hansi Chabbo hanged


! - He still reminds us of this tribal
 pahadiya samudaay kaa yah gorilla ladaaka ek aisi kinvadanti he jiske bare main aitihaasik dastavej sirf naam bhar kaa ullekh karte hai, puraa vivaran nahin dete
 But its guerrilla biographies and stories in the ancestral songs and stories of the Pahadia community still present an irresistible claim of being an adivasi after centuries
 tilka maanjhi santal the yaa pahadiya ise lekar vivaad he
 Generally, many writers have described Tilaka Manjhi as Moormal Gotra and termed them as Santal tribals
 parantu tilka ke santal hone kaa koi aitihaasik dastavej or likhit pramaan maujuud nahin he
 At the same time, according to historical documents, the people of the Santal tribal community came and settled towards the Santal Pargana after 1790 due to the famine of 1770
 The Annals of Rural Bengal, Volume 1, 1868 By Sir William Wilson Hunter main saaf likhaa he ki santal log birbhum se aaj ke singhbhum kii taraf nivas karte the
 During the famine of 1790, they migrated to present-day Santal Parganas
 hunter ne likhaa he, ‘1792 se santalon nayaa itihaas shuru hota he’ 
 By 1838 Hunter reported the settlement of 40 villages of Santals in Santal Pargana, in which their total population was 3000
 hunter yah bhi bataata he ki 1847 tak mi
 ward ne 150 gaanvon main kareeb ek lakh santalon ko basaaya 
 The Bengal District Gazetteer: Santal Pargana, published in 1910, volume 13 contains LSS
 o Meli wrote that when Mr
 When the ward was determining the boundary of Damine Koh in 1827, it met 3 villages in Santals in Patsunda and 27 villages in Barkop
 ward ke anusaar, ‘ye log khud ko santar kehete hai jo singhbhum or udhar ke ilaake ke rahane vaale hai

 Like other tribal communities, the tradition of naming the child in the name of ancestors is also in the santhas
 But in the past, even today, the name of a person is not found 'tilaka'
 lekin pahadiya samudaay ke logon main aaj bhi ‘zebra’ naam rakhane kaa prachlan he
 The British called Jabra Pahadia a dreaded dacoit and an angry Manjhi
 santalon main bhi maanjhi hote hai or badi aabaadi va 1855 ke hul ke kaaran ve zyada jane gaye, isliye tilka maanjhi urf zebra pahadiya ke santal adivasee hone kaa bhram failaa
 In fact, Jabra directly pretended to be loyal to the British rule as the army hero of the 'pahadia Hill Rangers' formed by the then District Collector of Bhagalpur and changed the name to 'tilaka' Manjhi with his hundreds of fighters in guerrilla manner
 From the British, the rulers were at war with the nobles and the nobles
 vaise, pahadiya bhashaa main ‘tilka’ kaa arth he gussell or laal-laal ankhon vaala vyakti
 Since he was the village head and it is the custom in the Pahadia community to call the village head as Manjhi
 isliye hill rangers kaa sardaar jorah urf zebra maanjhi tilka maanjhi ke naam se vikhyath ho gaye
 Jabra Pahadia is also present in British documents but Tilaka is not mentioned anywhere
 bangla kii suprasiddh lekhika mahasweta devi ne tilka maanjhi ke jivan or vidroh par bangla bhashaa main ek upanyaas 'shalagirar daake' kii rachana kii he
 In this novel, Mahashweta Devi has described Tilaka Manjhi as the Santal tribal of Murmu gotra
 yah upanyaas hindi main 'shalagirah kii pukaar par' naam se anuvaadit or prakashit hua he
 While Hindi novelist Rakesh Kumar Singh has portrayed Tilka Manjhi as Jabra Pahadia in his novel 'hool Pahadiya'
 ‘hul pahadiya’ upanyaas 2012 main prakashit hua he
 a center of education has been established in Bhagalpur named Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University in the name of Tilka Manjhi

 At that time, the army of Rani of Jhansi and rebel soldiers of Gwalior were facing crises due to lack of proper management of salary and ration etc
 for several months
 desh ke aise samay main amarchand banthia aage bade or maharani lakshmibai ke ek ishaare par gwalior kaa sara rajkosh vidrohiyon ke hawaale kar diya
 Shaheed Amarchand Banthia was born in 1793 in Bikaner, Rajputani Shaurya Bhumi of Rajasthan
 desh ke liye kuch kar guzarane kaa jajba shuru se hi unamem tha
 Since childhood, he was determined to do something for the country's dignity and pride
 itihaas main swa

 The Maharaja of the erstwhile Scindia princely state of Gwalior was impressed by his fame and made him treasurer of the treasury
 us samay gwalior kaa gangajali khajaana gupt rup se surakshit tha jisaki jaankaree keval chuninda logon ko hi thi

 His simplicity, ingenuity and duty were all convincing

 But the subject was often discussed in the authorities
 ek adhikari ne ek din jain mat maanane vaale amar chand banthia ji se kaha ki bharat mata ko daastaa se mukt karne ke liye ab to aapako bhi ahimsa chhodkar shastr uthaa lenaa chahie
 Banthiya Ji said that brother, i cannot take up arms, but one day when the time comes, i will do such work which will help the priests of the revolution
 tabhi gwalior par jhaansi kii rani lakshmibai kaa adhikaar ho gaya tathaa angrejon ke sahyogi shaasha vahaan se hatane ko vivash hue
 Laxmibai and Tatya Tope were taking iron from the British with their military force, but their army had not received any salary for many months and neither had proper arrangement for their food etc
 arthabhaav ke kaaran swadhinata samar dam todta dikhaai de rahaa tha
 Seeing this situation, Banthiya, without caring for his life, helped the revolutionaries and handed over the treasury of Gwalior to him
 yah dhanrashi unhone 8 june 1858 ko uplabdh karai
 With the help of his help, Veerangana Lakshmibai was successful in getting rid of the enemies' sixes
 virangana ke shahid hone ke chaar din baad hi shri amarchand banthia ko rajdroh ke aparaadh main unke nivas sthaan ke najadik sarafa bazaar main hi saarvajanik rup se neem ke ped par latakaakar phaansi de di

 The story of the film opens with a medical student Sunita and her classmates who are working with her on a human-brain project
 ha sanjay singhania, shahar ke namjad vyapaaree jo soochnanusaar ghatanottar smriti lop se peedit hai, kii vilakshan vastu-sthiti kii jaanch padtaal karnaa chaahati he
 His professor refuses access to Sanjay's recording as all his criminal facts are currently being investigated

 Sanjay is shown brutally killing another person
 vah us vyakti kii tasviir khinchataa he or samay tathaa tithi ke saath 'nishpadit' kii muhar apane note main laga detaa he
 It is shown that Sanjay has a peculiar disease of post-operative memory loss in which his memory disappears after every 15 minutes
 sanjay khinchi gai tasviren, note kar lenaa evam badan par gudwaaye godane kii paddatiyon kaa prayog har 15 minute ke chakra ke baad apni yaaddaasht ko phir se lautne ke liye karata he
 Every morning when Sanjay goes to the toilet, he sees a note written "take off the shirt" near the faucet of the wash basin
 jaise hi vah kameez utaarata he apane chaude seene par godane kii ek shrinkhalaa dekhtaa he
 When he sees "kalpana was murdered" anal, it is revealed from one end that Sanjay is finally ready to avenge Kalpana's murder and that's why he supposedly goes one by one to those people Who were responsible for the death of Kalpana
 likhe hue nots or gude hue godanon se yah saafe saboot miltaa he ki uskaa mukhya nishaanaa gajani he
 After all, it is also clear that Ghazni is a famous social personality of the city, but no one else

 Sanjay Singhania is a person of distinguished merchant descent who owns the Air Voice Telephone Company
 videsh main usne apni shiksha-diksha samaapt kar lee he or lautakar apane parivaar ke vyavsaay ko sambhaal liya he
 In the course of his business, Sanjay sends his employees to meet a combative actress / model Kalpana and talk about placing a huge advertisement board of Air Voice over her apartment
 kalpana kii modling / vigyaapan company kaa maalik ise ek romance kaa chakkar samajhane kii bhul kar baithta he or kalpana ko yah prastaav manjuur kar lene ko protsaahit karata he
 He promotes her as the lead model
 kalpana aamtaur par pyaari or rahamdil he
 She accepts this as an innocent prank and thus begins a dramatic game full of riddles as Sanjay's girlfriend
 aakhirkaar sanjay kalpana se miltaa he lekin vah usase kahata he ki vah sachin he or nai jindagi kii talash main chote qasbe se nikal kar bade shahar main aayaa ek adana insaan he

 vah uske prastaav par vichaar karne ke liye kuch samay maangati he
 Sanjay maintains that if she accepts his offer, he will reveal his true identity to her; And if she rejects, he will quietly return without harming her
 film kii kahani phir vartmaan main laut jaati he; jab yadav 2006 kii diary padhne lagata he
 Sanjay suddenly arrives, attacking Yadav and tying him up
 vah gajani ko ek college ke samaaroh main khoj nikaalata he jahaan vah sammanneey pradhan atithi he
 Sanjay takes some photographs of Ghajni and decides to kill her
 In the same ceremony, he meets Sunita; She also recognizes him by the cover on her file and intends to befriend her
 baad main usee shaam sanjay gajani ke ek gunde ko parking kshetra main maar giraata he
 He starts waiting for Ghazni's arrival but in the end decides to attack him again on some other occasion
 marataa hua ghayal gunda gajani ko do saal pehle ghati ek ghatana kii yaad dilaataa he jisame kalpana kii hatya kar di gai thi or sanjay aahat hokar ek mariz ban gaya tha
 Ghajni gets confused and fails to remember anything
 is bich, sunita sanjay ke flats main aati he or yadav ko petakar bandhaa hua padaa paati he
 He also comes to know that Ghajni is Sanjay's target
 yadav use is baat kii bhi jaankaree detaa he ki sanjay ek janamana serial hatyara he
 Sunita gets two diaries and frees Yadav
 achaanak isi bich sanjay vahaan pahunch jaataa he; use uname se kisi kii yaad nahin aati he or vah unka peechha karata hua baahar nikal jaataa he
 Ultimately Yadav gets hit by a bus and Sunita barely escapes the freak Sanjay
 yah jaankaar ki gajani khatre main he, vah use suchit kar detii hai ki yah sanjay hi he jo uski jaan ke peeche padaa hua he
 Targeting this name, Ghazni arrives at Sanjay's flat with the intention of killing him
 vah uske saare photographs or nots nasht kar detaa he or uske gunde sanjay ko kaabo main kar uske maujuuda godane par punah godwa dete he taaki puraani yaadon ko sanketit karne vaale saare nishaan mit jaaen
 itminan hokar kii puraani yaadon se jodanevaale saare nishaan mitaa die gaye, gajani sanjay ko isi haalat main chhodkar chalaa jaataa he
 Meanwhile, returning to the hostel, Sunita reads the 2006 diary
 film kii kahani phir 2006 ke purv drishy main laut jaati he
 It is shown that Kalpana accepted Sanjay's marriage proposal
 yah diary bhi achaanak samaapt ho jaati he
 Sunita further investigates and discovers that at some point in 2006, Kalpana was inadvertently entangled in a bad web of unsuspecting prostitutes
 railyatra ke dauraan uski bhent 25 nirih bholi bhali kamasin ladakiyon se hui jo dhandhe ke liye mumbai bheji ja raheen thim
 She protects those girls and saves them
 lekin ladkiyaan giroh ke sargana ke rup main gajani kaa naam letin hai
 Ghazni in his own way uses his medium to stop the girls' tongue and Kalpana sets out to find herself
 gajani or uske gunde tod-phod karte hue kalpana ke apartment main ghus jate hai or uske laut aane kii pratiksha karte he jabaki kalpana andar hi mil jaati he
 Coincidentally, Sanjay reached there to meet Kalpana
 kalpana kaa antim uccharit shabd tha "gajani "
 gundon ne kalpana par hamalaa kar diya
 Sanjay was about to intervene when suddenly Ghazni struck his head with an iron rod
 sanjay kii aankhon ke saamne antim drishy kaundh jaataa he, ki gajani ke lohe kii chad ke krur prahaar se hi kalpana kii hatya hui thi
 Sunita now realizes the truth about the shock, she meets Sanjay and tells him what the truth is
 gusse se bekaabu hokar vah ji-jaan se gajani kaa peechha karata he
 Upon reaching Ghazni's den in Mumbai, Sanjay brutally kills all the Ghazni's retainers one by one in a planned manner and falls behind Ghajni
 durdamy dhang se khadedta hua vah uske paas pahunch kar ladaai main bhid jaataa he
 He wants to kill Ghazni so that his memory cycle disappears again and he forgets the present
 gajani mudata he or chura bhonk detaa he
 While mocking Sanjay, he narrates the gruesome tale of how he murdered Kalpana, when suddenly Sanjay overcomes his power with the ultimate boil
 sanjay gajani ko thik usee tarah martha he jis tarah gajani ne kalpana kii hatya kii thi
 The film progresses to its end, with Sanjay still working as a volunteer in an orphanage suffering from a memory loss
 sunita use ek chota-sa uphaar detii he jo ki plaster ke patt par sanjay or kalpana ke dabe qadamon ke nishaan hai jab undonon ne ek nae apartment main pravesh kiya tha - kalpana ke saath uske antarang saahchary kii yaad taaja karne ke liye hi vah aisa karti he
 The decision is left to the audience whether Sanjay's memory returns again or not
