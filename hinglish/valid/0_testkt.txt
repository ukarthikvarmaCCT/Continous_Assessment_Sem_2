 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge

 computing yani sanganan main feed agrigater, jise feed reader, news reader yaa saadharantah agrigater kaha jaataa he ek desktop yaa web anuprayog hota he jo ki internet par muhaiyaa syndicated masaude, masalan samachar surkhiyaan, blog, podcast or vlog kaa sankalan kar ek hi sthaan par use pradarshit karata he
 As this content keeps on changing or updating, the compiler has to constantly monitor the draft feed
 is lekh main agrigater ke liye sankalak shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, par dhyaan rahe ki yah maanak shabd nahin he
 The syndicated draft that the compiler accepts is usually provided in RSS or any other formatted format such as RDF or Atom
 sankalak jaalasthalon yani websits par nai saamagree jode jane kaa pataa lagane main vyay hone vaale samay va shram kii bachat karata he or ek tarah se pathak ke liye uskaa vyaktigat akhbaar bana kar use pesh karata he
 Once a feed has been subscribed or become a regular reader, the compiler locates the new content at fixed intervals according to the user's wish and delivers the content to it
 is takanic ko pul taknalaji kaha jaataa he
 This is the exact opposite of push technology used in tools such as email or instant messaging
 saath hi push takanic se saamagree ke graahakon kii tulana main sankalak badi saralata se kisi bhi feed se anasbsakraib kar saktaa he yani uskaa pathak banane se inkaar kar saktaa he
 Most compilers also allow the user to export and import a list of feeds read by his or other readers in OPML format

 This feature is also available on modern web browsers and email programs

 Web-based compilers are applications that are located on remote servers and are used on a network of applications such as Google Reader or bloglines
 chunki ye anuprayog internet ke madhyam se prayukt hote hai atah prayokta apni sabsakribd feed ko jahaan bhi internet sampark uplabdh ho vahaan pard saktaa he
 Modern compilers use technologies like Agax and are also available as multiple widgets
 vyaktigat sankalkon ke alaava saamudayik sankalak bhi hote hai jo saamanytah kisi laghu samudaay ke feed kaa sankalan karte hai
 For example, see the page of the list of compilers at the end of the article

 Their graphical user interface is similar to most popular email clients such as Outlook, with a draft showing in most three panels, a list of subscribed feeds on the left, which can be grouped into groups, folders, or squares, and a draft entry in the right panel

 Many programming languages provide libraries that application builders or website owners can read feeds using or display or use in different formats

 Media compilers, also known as podcatchers due to the popularity of podcasts, are compilers of feeds in which the draft is primarily audio or video
 feed main ye ke rup main daale jate hai
 These can be mesh or desktop based applications
 ye media ko downlod kar use chalaa sakate hai yaa ypod jaise kisi bahari media player ke saath sikronies bhi kar sakate hai
 Content redundancy is a fundamental problem with compilers, especially if the user is a reader of multiple feeds
 sankalak alag alag taur par is samasya se nibatate hai
 In addition to facilitating the categorization of feeds to the user, they take advantage of the tags and keywords attached to the entries

 is dharmasutra kaa uplabdh rup anek prakshepon se yukt he
 For example, in the 19th chapter, the fraction of Karmavipak is added later
 isapar na to muscari kaa bhashya or na hardutt kii vyakhya he
 The sixth sutra of chapter 6 also appears to be a subsequent projection on the words of Gautam Dharmasutra quoted by Baudhayana and the internal evidence of the Dharmasutra presented
 isamen anya dharmasutron ke samaan bich bich main footkar padya nahin hai
 The entire Gautam Dharmasutra is in prose, though some sutras are written in Vattagandhishali and seem to be part of the Anushtupa, its language being more adherent to Paninian grammar than other Dharmasutras, but this rite also appears to be later
 kyonki is dharmasutra main samavidhan brahman kaa ek ansh gruhit he or vasishtha or boudhayan dharmasutron main is dharmasutra ke maton kaa nampurvak ullekh he, at: isaki rachana samavidhan brahman ke baad or vasishtha or boudhayandharmasutron ke purv hui hogi
 On the basis of this fact and the criticism of Varnashrama Dharma made by Buddhism and the absence of its supplication, the creation period of this Dharmasutra is considered to be 600-400 AD
 isapar hardutt kii "mitakshra" vyakhya or muscari kaa "bhashya" he
 The sage Rishi Gautama is considered a sage Gautama
 gautam naam kaa ullekh pracheen shastron main anekatra paaya jaataa he
 As such, the leader of justice philosophy is also considered to be Akshpad Gautam
 kathopanishad main gautam kaa prayog nachiketa tathaa uske pita vajashravas ke liye hua he
 Similarly, Acharya named Haridrum is mentioned in the Chandogya Upanishad *
 atharvaveda* main bhi gautam naam he
 The sage Rehugan of the Rigveda * is Gautama
 inamen se kisne dharmasutra kaa pranayan kiya he, yah anishchit he
 According to Charanview's commentary, Gautam was the head of a department of Samaveda's Ranayani branch
 * The Gautam Dharmasutra has only three questions
 pratham tathaa dwitiya prashn main nau–nau adhyay tathaa tritiy prashn main das adhyay hai
 Thus the entire Gautama Dharmasutra is divided into 28 chapters, which contains a Sahasra Sutra
 yah granth keval gadhy main he tathaa sabhi dharmasutron main pracheenatam he
 The scriptures of the Vedas are quoted in the form of this book
 yadhyapi in sutron main yajurveda ke mantra bhi uddhrut hai tathaapi is granth kaa sambandh samaveda se mana jaataa he, kyonki isamen na keval samaveda ke anek vishyon ko hi grahan kar liya gaya he, apitu samaveda ke kai sookhton kaa nirdesh bhi he
 Also, in the eighth chapter of the third question of this treatise, many sutras are quoted from the Brahmin, the Samvadhana of Samaveda
 isi prakaar tritiy prashnptr ke pratham adhyay ke barahawein sutara main samaveda ke nau mantron kaa nirdesh he
 The sutras of the first chapter of the first question are the 52nd and the 8th sutra of the seventh chapter of the third question mentions five Mahayahritiyas
 in vyahritiyon kaa sambandh bhi samaveda se hi he
 On the basis of these evidences, the relation of Gautama Dharmasutra is clear with Samaveda

 kane ne gautam dharmasutra kaa sambandh gautamakalp se mana he, kintu saath hi unhone isaki swatantra rachana kaa mat bhi pratipaadit kiya he
 * samay samay par gautam dharmasutra main prakshep bhi hote rahe hai
 This has often happened with many texts
 gautam dharmasutra bhi iskaa apwaad nahin he
 It can be said in evidence that in the Buddhist Dharmasutra, it is quoted from the name of Gautama that the Brahmin should not accept Kshatriya's instinct
 * kintu vartmaan gautam dharmasutra main yah mat uplabdh nahin hota, apitu iske sthaan par yah kaha gaya he ki aaptkaal main brahman kshatriya tathaa vaisya kii vritti ko bhi apana saktaa he
 * Similarly, in the Vasistha Dharmasutra, the idea has been expressed by the name of Gautam that if someone dies in a yathagni yatra, then his or her effigy should be revived by the effigy of the grass, but there is no such formula in the present Gautama Dharmasutra
 gautam dharmasutra main anek paath–bhed bhi uplabdh hote hai tathaa kai pandulipiyon main karmvipak par ek puraa prakaran jod diya gaya, jis par hardutt kii vyakhya nahin he
 Based on these evidences, the scholars believe that there have been many changes in the Gautam Dharmasutra from time to time
 kundalaal sharma ji kaa vichaar haih– 'is prakaar ke paath–bhed yaa prakshep kumaril se purv hi kiye gaye the kyonki 'tantra vaarthtik'* main is prakaar ke pathbhedon kii charchaa kii gai he
 Many sutras of this composition cited in Mitakshara, Smritichandrika and other texts are not available in the current editions
 ' The period of Gautama Dharmasutra is believed to be before 400–600 BC
 is avadharana main hetu yah he ki anek granthon main gautam kaa ullekh praapt hota he
 Which automatically proves that Gautama Dharmasutra precedes them
 isi prakaar gautam dharmasutra main bhi anya sahitya kaa ullekh praapt hota he
 Therefore, this sutra book has to be considered as the latter from that literature
 donon paksh is prakaar hai– Gautama Dharmasutra does not mention the name of any Dharmasutra, but only by the words 'ityke', 'ekashaam', 'AK', the mentors preceding it have been mentioned in it
 gautam dharmasutra* main manu ke naam se ek mat diya gaya he
 While explaining Gautam Dharmasutra, Muskari has given many examples from Manusmriti in confirmation of his interpretation
 shodhakon ne gautam dharmasutra matha manusmriti ke padon main 500 se adhik samanthaayen khoj leen hai to bhi isse yah siddh nahin hota ki vartmaan manusmriti gautam dharmasutra kaa mukhya strot he
 In the * Gautama Dharmasutra *, the veda-vedang by saying 'lokvedvedavangavitta' and in the * 'vakovakyayitha Purana Kushalah' have also discussed Puranas etc
 saath hi gautam dharmasutra* main upanishad–veydant aadi kaa ullekh bhi kiya he
 * Similarly 2–2–28 also has hints towards nirukta *
 * in pramaanon ke aadhaar par gautam dharmasutra in granthon main se parvarti prathit hota he
 Gautama is mentioned twice in the Boudhayan Dharmasutra
 * samaveda ke shrautasutra latyayan* evam drahyayan* bhi gautam ko uddhrut karte hai
 The Samvediya Gobhilagrihyasutra * also considers the Gautama Dharmasutra to be authentic
 vasishtha dharmasutra* main gautam ko uddhrut kiya gaya he
 The 19th chapter of Gautama Dharmasutra is in the form of the 22nd chapter in the Vasistha Dharmasutra
 manusmriti* main gautam ko utathy kaa putr kaha gaya he tathaa yajyavlky–smriti main* gautam kii gananaa dharamshastron main kii gai he
 Shankaracharya has quoted Gautama Dharmasutra * in vedantasutra-bhasya *
 * in pramaanon ke aadhaar par gautam dharmasutra in rachanaaon ke pashchaat tehraata he
 Dr
 Jolly considers Gautam Dharmasutra centuries before the Apastamb Dharmasutra

 Generally, all religions are represented by human personal and social ethics and duties
 gautam dharmasutra main bhi inke sambandh main vishad vivechan kiya gaya he
 Like other Dharmasutras, the rules of Varna and Ashrams and the daily Dharmakrutis of Varnas have been enacted mainly in Gautam Dharmasutra
 varnashram–vyavastha ko gautam dharmasutra atyant mahatv pradaan karata he, yahan tak ki isamen varnashram se hin, apavitra tathaa patiton ke saath sambhaashan kaa bhi nishedh he
 As a brahmachari, grihastha, Vaikhanas and monk, Gautama divided human life into four ashrams and detailed the duties of the four ashrams
 gautam grihasthashram ko mahatv dete hai, kyonki sabhi ashram isi ke ashrith hai
 Gautama considers Sanyasashram to be important as Angrat monks of other ashrams
 vanprastha yaa vaikhanas grihasth tathaa sanyas ke bich kii kadi he
 Gautama has considered in detail about the Kartavyaadi of all those ashrams
 ashram–vyavastha ke antargat gautam ne atithi–satkar ko bahut mahatv diya he
 According to Gautam Dharmasutra * the sannyas should also do guest service and the householder should be 'devapitrimanushyapujika'
 duhkhi, rogi, nirdhan or vidhyaarthee kii sahaayta karnaa grihasth kaa param dharm he
 He should feed himself by giving food to guest, child, patient, woman, old man, servants
 grihasth–dharm ke paalnarth gautam ne paanch mahayagyon kaa vidhaan kiya he
 * Along with this, many rules have also been made for the purity of this religion
 ashram–dharm ke prasang main gautam dharmasutra main dayaa, kshamaa, paranindarahitya aadi maanviya gunon par bal diya gaya he
 Along with these qualities, the law of giving donations has also been done here, but according to Gautam Dharmasutra *, donations should be given according to the qualification of the character
 gautam kaa satyabhaashan tathaa satya aacharan par bahut bal he
 It is mandatory for all
 isiilie satya bhaashan ko mahaan tap kaha gaya he
 Speaking of truth has also been said to achieve heaven and false speech as hell
 in gunon ke saath manushya ko ahimsak, mridu, sahishnu, kshamashil bhi hona chahie
 In this way, an effort has been made to make personal and social life superior in Gautam Dharmasutra
 iske saath gautam yah bhi jaanate hai ki vyakti apni swaabhaavik kamazori ke kaaran kupath main pravrutt ho jaataa he
 Sometimes immorality pervades the whole society, but if diligently done, these weaknesses can be delayed
 isliye gautam dharmasutra main dand swaroop anek prakaar ke praayashchatton kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he jinase vyakti shuddh hokar punah shreshth jivan vyateet kar saktaa he
 Meat-eating is also mentioned somewhere in this book, but it appears to be projectile
 gautam dharmasutra main ashram–vyavastha ke saath varna–vyavastha par bhi paryaapt prakaash daalaa gaya he
 In this context, Brahmin has been given the paramount position
 brahman, kshatriya, vaisya tathaa shudra ke rup main chaaron varnon ke karttavya evam adhikaron kaa yahan acha vivechan kiya gaya he
 For the smooth functioning of varna system, only the upper caste marriage has been recognized
 yadi koi asavarna vivaah karata he to uski santaan varnsankar kehalaaegi
 It has also been said here that the varnasankar child, which lasts continuously for seven generations, also becomes an excellent varna or inferior varna on the basis of their own works
 praayshchitt, aparaadh, dand, mrityu tathaa janmavishyak ashauch bhi varnanusaar hi nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai
 Probably the Brahmin must have been kept free from the shackles due to his scholarship and best conduct
 isliye gautam dharmasutra* main ‘tadpekshastadvrittih’ kaha gaya he
 The position of the Shudras does not appear to be good in the Gautama Dharmasutra
 unke liye dharmik sanskaar vihit nahin hai tathaa keval grihasthashram hi unke liye vihit he
 This religion of Shudra has been told to serve the people of higher varna
 gautam dharmasutra main nari ko paryaapt mahatv diya gaya he, kyonki vah santaan kii janani he
 He has been called the best teacher
 yadhyapi gruhasambandhi tathaa dharmik kaaryon main gruhinee tathaa sahdharmini ke rup main vah pratishthit pad par asin he tathaapi use dharm ke vishay main aswatantra kaha he
 Marriage of a girl is subject to the parents, but if they do not marry the girl on time, then she can marry a suitable young man herself
 stri ke liye pativraty dharm anivaary he
 She should not even think about anyone other than her husband
 aniatik yon sambandhon ke liye kathortam dand kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 In Gautam Dharmasutra, the following form of woman is visible as a maid
 ek sutara* main to yahan tak kah diya gaya ki daasi yadi kisi purush ke paas bandhak rakhi gai he to vah uskaa upbhog kar saktaa he
 The justification of this statement has been given by the commentator of Gautam Dharmasutra Harddatta, by saying that how long can a person keep restraint on the consumables kept near him? This statement of Haradatta violates the limits of morality
 kaaran kuch bhi ho, yah sthiti samaaj kii hin avasthaa kii suchak he
 The state-law is also highlighted in the Gautam Dharmasutra
 gautam* ke anusaar pranimaatr kii raksha karnaa tathaa nyaaypurvak dand dekar praja ko supath main rakhana raja kaa karttavya he
 The king performs the king work with the help of a scholar and virtuous Brahmin
 dharmasutron main raja nirankush nahin he
 The process of his justice is also democratic
 rajya main brahman dharm kaa vidhaan karne vaala tathaa raja uskaa paalan karaane vaala he
 * Thus a very co-ordinate public order has been rendered in the Gautam Dharmasutra
 samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ke praayah sabhi prakaar ke karttavyon kaa nirdhaaran karke samaaj ko sahi disha dene kaa praytn yahan par kiya gaya he jisase samaaj unnati kar sake tathaa logon main prem, nyaay, dayaa, paroapkaar aadi gunon kii vruddhi ho
 In short, Gautam, through his Dharmasutra, has tried to control the entire society from moral and social point of view

 Kautilya's 'arthashastra' is an important work of political principles
 is sambandh main yah prashn uthta he ki kautilya ne apni pustak kaa naam 'arthshaastra' kyon rakhaa? prachinkaal main 'arthshaastra' shabd kaa prayog ek vyapak arth main hota tha
 Under this, the study of political science, theology, economics, law etc
 was originally done
 acharya kautilya kii drushti main raajnneeti shaastra ek swatantra shaastra he or anvikshiki, trayee tathaa vaarta env kanoon aadi uski shakhaayen hai
 The entire society is protected by politics or penal system or only the protected subjects can follow their duties
 us samay arthshaastra ko raajnneeti or prashasan kaa shaastra mana jaataa tha
 There is a context in this connection in the Mahabharata, in which Arjuna is considered an expert on economics
 nishchit rup se kautilya kaa arthshaastra bhi rajshastra ke rup main liya gaya hoga, yon usne arth kii kai vyakhyaayein kii hai
 Kautilya has said - Manushayanam vritirartha, that is to say, the meaning of the livelihood of human beings
 arthshaastra kii vyakhya karte hue usne kaha he—tasya pruthivya laabhpalnopaayah shaastramarth-shastramiti
 Thus, it is also clear that 'economics' includes principles related to both the polity and the economy
 vastutah kautilya 'arthshaastra' ko keval rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha kaa shaastra kahana upyukt nahin hoga
 In fact, it is the scripture related to economy, state, law, social system and religious system
 kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or bhi kai arthshaastron kii rachana kii gayi thi, yadhyapi unki pandulipiyaan uplabdh nahin hai
 In India, since ancient times, efforts have been made for the combination and combination of meaning, work and religion and for this there are detailed discussions in the scriptures, memories and Puranas
 kautilya ne bhi 'arthshaastra' main arth, kaam or dharm kii prapti ke upayon kii vyakhya kii he
 In the 'kamasutra' of Vatsyayan, sources have been composed in relation to the meaning, religion and work
 apane purv arthshaastron kii rachana kii baat swayan kautilya ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 In his 'arthashastra' he has mentioned Acharya Vrihaspati, Bharadwaja, Shukracharya, Parashar, Pishun, Vishalaksha etc
 in many references
 kautilya ke purv anek aacharyon ke granthon kaa namakaran dandniti ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It seems that Kautilya's earlier scriptures were called Dandaniti and were similar to Arthashastra
 parantu jaisaa ki anek vidwaanon ne sweekaar kiya he ki dandniti or arthshaastra donon samroop nahin hai
 U
 N
 According to Ghoshal's statement, Arthashastra is a more comprehensive scripture, whereas Dandaniti is only its branch
 kautilya ke paashchaat likhe gayi shaastra 'nitishastra' ke naam se vikhyath hue, jaise kaamandak nitisar
 By the way, many scholars have considered economics more comprehensive than ethics
 parantu, adhikansh vidwaanon kii raay main nitishastra or arthshaastra donon samroop hai tathaa donon ke vishay kshetra bhi ek hi hai
 Kamandaka himself has considered ethics and economics to be identical
 uparyukt vivechan se yah spasht he ki kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or uske baad bhi 'arthshaastra' jaise shastron kii rachana kii gayi
 In this regard, there are a large number of scholars who believe that Kautilya was not the creator of 'arthashastra'
 aise vidwaanon main paashchaatya vidwaanon kii sankhya zyada he
 Stan, Jolly, Winterneese and Keith are exponents of this type of thought
 bhartiya vidwaan aar
 ji
 bhandarkar ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya he
 Bhandarkar has said that Patanjali did not mention Kautilya in the Mahabhashya
 'arthshaastra' ke rachayita ke rup main kautilya ko nahin manyata denevaalon ne apane mat ke samarthan main nimnlikhit tark prastut kiye hai— It is clearly written at the end of the book- saath hi yah bhi likhaa gaya he: This incident is discussed in Vishnu Purana as follows: ‘nitisar’ ke karta kaamandak ne bhi ghatana kii pushti karte hue likhaa he: It is clear from these quotes that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were the same person
 ‘arthshaastra’ main hi dwitiya adhikaran ke dasham adhyay ke ant main pustak ke rachayita kaa naam ‘kautilya’ bataaya gaya he: By writing 'kautilyan Kritam Shastra' at the beginning of the book and 'iti Kautiliyearthastra' at the end of each chapter, the author has made his' Kautilya name more famous
 jahaan-jahaan anya aacharyon ke mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he, ant main ‘iti kautilya’ arthath kautilya kaa mat he-is tarah kahkar kautilya naam ke liye apana adhik pakshpaat pradarshit kiya he
 But it is absolutely undisputed that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were integral persons
 uttarkalin dandi kavi ne ise acharya vishnugupt naam se yadi kaha he, to banbhatta ne ise hi kautilya naam se pukaara he
 The statement of both is that this Acharya composed 'dandaniti' or 'arthashastra'
 panchatantra main isi acharya kaa naam chanakya diya gaya he, jo arthshaastra kaa rachayita he
 In the poet visakhadatta-praneeth well-known drama Mudrarakshas, chanakya is sometimes referred to as Kautilya and sometimes Vishnugupta
 ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana ‘shashan-vidhi’ ke rup main pratham maury samraat chandragupta ke liye kii gai
 Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the period of its creation as the period of the emperor Chandragupta

 As stated above, its main subject is governance-law or governance-science: "kautilyan Narendrathe's rule of law: Krita"
 ’’ in shabdon se spasht he ki acharya ne isaki rachana raajnneeti-shaastra tathaa visheshtya shashan-prabandh kii vidhi ke rup main kii
 Seeing the table of contents of economics, it is well proved that it is a mistake to call it the book of economics nowadays
 pratham adhikaran ke prarambh main hi swayan acharya ne ise 'dandniti' naam se suchit kiya he
 Shukracharya has described Dandaniti as such an important discipline that it has assumed the presence of all other disciplines - because according to the dictation of 'shastren Rakshe Deshe Shastraschhinta Pravartate', there can be concern or practice of other scriptures in the country, well protected and protected by weapons
 is
 at: dandniti ko anya sab vidyaon kii aadharbhoot vidya ke rup main sweekaar karnaa aavashyak he or vahi dandniti arthshaastra he
 The term 'dialogue' has been used for what is now called economics, although the term is not entirely indicative of economics
 kautilya ne vaarta ke teen ang kahe hai - krishi, vaanijya tathaa pashu-paalan, jinase praaia: vritti yaa jeevika kaa uparjan kiya jaataa tha
 The scholars of Manu, Yajnavalkya etc
 have also accepted the dialogue of these three parts
 peeche shukracharya ne is vaarta main kuseed ko bhi vritti ke saadhan-rup main sammilit kar diya he
 But economics has been described by all the scholars as politics, politics or governance
 at: ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko raajnneeti kii pustak samajhnaa hi thik hoga na ki sampattishastra kii pustak
 By the way, in some cases, the relevant topics of wealth creation, wealth and wealth exchange, wealth division etc
 have also been discussed
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran kaa praarambhik vachan is sambandh main adhik prakaash daalane vaala he: That is, this one economics has been created by taking the summary of all the economics which the ancient masters have written to win the earth and show the ways of rearing
 yah uddhran arthshaastra ke vishay ko jahaan spasht karata he, vahaan is satya ko bhi prakashit karata he ki ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ se purv anek aacharyon ne arthshaastra kii rachanaaen kin, jinka uddeshy prithvi-vijay tathaa uske paalan ke upayon kaa pratipaadan karnaa tha
 Some names of those Acharyas and their sects have been directed in 'kautilya Arthashastra', although their works are not available even today
 ye naam nimnlikhit he: In the tenants of these ten sects of economics, almost everything is known in relation to everyone, but very little introduction is found about Vishalaksha
 in naamon se yah to atyant spasht he ki arthshaastra nitishastra ke prati anek mahaan vichaarkon tathaa darshanikon kaa dhyaan gaya or is vishay par ek ujjwal sahitya kaa nirmaan hua
 Today that literature is lost
 anek videshi akramanon tathaa rajyakrantiyon ke kaaran is sahitya kaa naam-maatr shesh rah gaya he, parantu jitna bhi sahitya avshisht he vah ek vistrut arthshaastreey parampara kaa sanket karata he
 In this Arthashastra, such a system of governance has been enacted in which the king or ruler rules for the welfare of the subjects
 raja swechhachari hokar shashan nahin kar saktaa
 He has to rule over the subjects only after getting the help of the Council of Ministers
 rajya-purohit raja par ankush ke samaan he, jo dharm-maarg se chyut hone par raja kaa niyantran kar saktaa he or use kartavya-paalan ke liye vivash kar saktaa he
 Kautilya, which is the form of an all-round nation, is clear from the following word of 'arthashastra' - arthath-praja ke sukh main raja kaa sukh he, prajake hit main uskaa hit he
 The king has nothing but his own love, the beloved of the people is his favorite
 400 ri0 san ke lagbhag kaamandak ne kautilya ke arthshaastra ke aadhaar par kaamandakeey nitisar naamak 20 sargon main vibhakt kavyarup ek arthshaastra likhaa tha
 It also considers the principles of ethics and foreign policy
 somdev suri kaa nitivakyamrita, hemachandra kaa laghu arthniti, bhoj kaa yuktikalpataru, shukr kaa shukraniti aadi kuch duusare suprasiddh arthshaastra hai, jinako nitishastra ke vyaavhaarik paksh kii vyakhya karne vaale granthon ke antargat bhi gina ja saktaa he

 It is also called 'banaras' and 'kashi'

 Apart from this, it is also considered sacred in Buddhism and Jainism

 Kashi Naresh is the chief cultural patron of Varanasi city and an integral part of all religious activities

 This city has been the cultural and religious center of India, especially North India, for thousands of years

 Many philosophers, poets, writers, musicians of India have lived in Varanasi, including Kabir, Vallabhacharya, Ravidas, Swami Ramanand, Tralang Swamy, Shivanand Goswami, Munshi Premchand, Jaishankar Prasad, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Pandit Ravi Shankar, Girija Devi, Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia and Ustad Bismillah Khan are few

 Four major universities are located in Varanasi: Banaras Hindu University, Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth, Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies and Sampurnanand Sanskrit University

 Varanasi is often referred to with adjectives like 'city of temples', 'religious capital of India', 'city of Lord Shiva', 'city of lamps', 'city of knowledge'
 prasiddh amareeki lekhak mark twain likhte hai: "banaras itihaas se bhi puraatan he, paramparaon se purana he, kinvadantiyon se bhi pracheen he or jab in sabko ekatra kar den, to us sangrah se bhi doguna pracheen he
 " varanasi naam kaa udgam sambhawatah yahaan kii do sthaneey nadiyon varuna nadi evam asi nadi ke naam se milakar bana he
 These rivers come from the north and south respectively in the Ganges river
 naam kaa ek anya vichaar varuna nadi ke naam se hi aata he jise sambhawatah pracheen kaal main varnasi hi kaha jaataa hoga or isi se shahar ko naam mila
 There may be some early lessons in support of this, but the historians do not consider this second idea to be correct
 lambey kaal se varanasi ko avimukt kshetra, anand-kaanan, mahashmashaan, surandhan, brahmavart, sudarshan, ramya, evam kaashi naam se bhi sambodhit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The city has been called Kashi or Kasi in the Rigveda
 ise prakashit shabd se liya gaya he, jiskaa abhipraay shahar ke aitihaasik str se he, kyonki ye shahar sadaa se gyaan, shiksha evam samskruti kaa kendra rahaa he
 The word Kashi first comes from the Pappalad branch of the Atharvaveda and is also mentioned in the Shatapath
 lekin yah sambhav he ki nagar kaa naam janapad main purana ho
 The glory of the city is stated in 15,000 verses in the Kashi Khand of Skanda Purana
 ek shloke main bhagwaan shiv kehete hai: There is a city consisting of three worlds, in which my residence is located, Kashi
 varanasi kaa ek anya sandarbh rishi veda vyas ne ek anya gadhy main diya he: Ganga Tarang delightful Jatakalapnam, Gauri continuously adorned Vamabham atharvaveda main varanavati nadi kaa naam aayaa he jo bahut sambhav he ki aadhunik varuna nadi ke liye hi prayog kiya gaya ho
 The river Assi is called Asisambheda Tirtha in the Puranas
 skanda puraana ke kaashi khand main kaha gaya he ki sansar ke sabhi tirth mil kar asisambhed ke solahaven bhaag ke baraabar bhi nahin hote hai
 The Agni river derives the Asi River and is also called Nasi
 varnasi kaa padchhed karen to nasi naam kii nadi nikaali gayi he, jo kalantar main asee naam main badal gai
 In the Mahabharata, the ancient name of Varuna or modern Barna river is confirmed as Varanasi
 atah varanasi shabd ke do nadiyon ke naam se banane kii baat baad main banaayi gai he
 There is also a verse in the Kashi Mahatmya, Volume-3 of Padma Purana: varanasiti vikhyataan tanman nigadaami va: dakshinottaryornaghorvarnasisch purvat
 Jārvi Pāऽī xxrep 4 ऽ ापिापिापिापिa Pāपाapāणिīrāgāneshwar: 
 In the Matsya Purana, Shiva describes Varanasi as saying - varanasyaan nadi pu siddhagandharvasevita
 Entry Tripatha Ganga Tasmin Kshetra mam dear yahaan assi kaa kahin ullekh nahin he
 Explaining the expansion of Varanasi region, another place has been said in Matsya Purana- varna c nadi yavadyavachhushkandi tathaa
 6 of Bhishmayandikamambha Parvateshwaramanti uparokt uddharanon se yahi gyaat hota he ki vastav main nagar kaa namakaran varanasi par basane se hua
 The fantasy of settling Varanasi between the eighties and Varuna arose from the time when the city's religious glory rose and at the same time the population in the south of the city came under its limits
 vaise varna shabd ek vriksh kaa bhi naam hota he
 In ancient times, cities used to get names in the name of trees as well, like Kosambi to Kaushambi, Rohit to Rohtik etc
 atah yah sambhav he ki varanasi or varanavati donon kaa hi naam is vriksh vishesh ko lekar hi padaa ho
 For the above reason of the name Varanasi, it should not be inferred that from the above discussion of this city it should not be understood that this capital city of Kashi State had only one name
 akele buddha sahitya main hi iske anek naam milte hai
 Surudhan in Udaya Jataka, Sudarshan in Sutasom Jataka, Brahmavardhana in Somandak Jataka, Pushpavati in Khandhal Jataka, Ramm Nagar in Yuvanjaya Jataka, Molino names in Shankh Jataka
 ise casinagar or casipur ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 Its capital was named Potali in the time of Emperor Ashoka
 yah nishchay purvak nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki ye sabhi naam ek hi shahar ke the, yaa kaashi rajya kii alag-alag samay par raheen ek se adhik rajdhaniyon ke naam the
 According to mythology, the city of Kashi was founded by the Hindu Lord Shiva about 5000 years ago, due to which it is an important pilgrimage site today
 ye hinduon kii pavitra saptpuriyon main se ek he
 This city is mentioned in many Hindu texts including Skanda Purana, Ramayana, Mahabharata and the oldest Vedas Rigveda
 saamanyatya varanasi shahar ko lagbhag 3000 varsh pracheen mana jaataa he
 , But according to Hindu traditions, Kashi is considered more ancient than this
 nagar malamal or reshmi kapadon, itron, hathi daant or shilp kala ke liye vyapaarik evam audyogic kendra rahaa he
 During the era of Gautama Buddha, Varanasi used to be the capital of Kashi state
 prasiddh chini yatri hwain tsang ne nagar ko dharmik, shaikshanik evam kalatmak gatividhiyon kaa kendra bataaya he or iskaa vistaar ganga nadi ke kinare 5 kimi tak likhaa he
 Since time immemorial in Kashi, many great personalities have been born or inhabited
 inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: Varanasi became an independent Kashi state in the 18th century and under the later British rule, it remained a major trading and religious center
 1910 main british prashasan ne varanasi ko ek nayaa bhartiya rajya banaaya or ramnagar ko iskaa mukhyalay banaaya, kintu iskaa adhikaar kshetra kuch nahin tha
 The King of Kashi still lives in the Ramnagar Fort
 ye kila varanasi nagar ke purv main ganga ke tat par bana hua he
 The Ramnagar Fort was built by Kashi Naresh Raja Balwant Singh in the 18th century by Uttam Chunar Sandstone
 kila mughal sthapaty style main nakkashidaar chazzon, khule praangan or suramya gumbaddaar mandapon se susajjit bana he
 Another palace of Kashi Naresh is Chait Singh Mahal
 ye shivala ghat ke nikat maharaja chait singh ne banwaaya tha
 The Ramnagar Fort and its museum are now preserved in the historical heritage of the kings of Banaras and have been the official residence of the King of Kashi since the 18th century
 aaj bhi kaashi naresh nagar ke logon main sammanit hai
 They are considered to be the religious presidents of the city and people here consider them to be an avatar of Lord Shiva
 naresh nagar ke pramukh saanskrithik sangrakshak evam sabhi badi dharmik gatividhiyon ke abhinn ang rahe hai
 a large part of the city of Varanasi has been called Kashi since ancient times
 ise hindu manyata main sabase bada tirth mana jaataa he, kintu tirth ke rup main varanasi kaa sabase purana ullekh mahabharat me miltaa he
 There is no mention of any pilgrimage etc
 in any pre-mahabharata literature
 aaj ke tirthasthal tab adhiktar van pradesh main the or manushyon se rahit the
 The Adivasis must have lived somewhere
 kalantar main tirthon ke bare main kahi gayi kathaayen astitva main aayin or tirth badhate gayi, jinke aasapaas nagar or shahar bhi based
 The existence and significance of pilgrimages was revealed by the spread of Aryans in Bharatbhoomi
 mahabharat main ullekh he prithvi ke kuch sthaan punyaprad tathaa pavitra hote he
 Some of these have become sacred due to the strangeness of the place, some by the influence of birth and some by the contact of sages and sages
 yajurvedic jabal upanishad main kaashi ke vishay main mahatvapurn varnan aata he, parantu is upanishad ko aadhunik vidwaan utana pracheen nahin maanate hai
 In jabal-upanishad Block-2, Maharishi Atri asked Maharishi Yajnavalkya how to know the latent and eternal God
 tab yajyavlky ne kaha ki us avyakt or anant aatma kii upasna avimukt kshetra main ho sakati he, kyonki vah vahiin pratishthit he
 And on asking the status of Atri's liberation
 yajyavlky ne uttar diya ki vah varna tathaa nashi nadiyon ke madhya main he
 Asking what that Varana is and what that intoxicant is, the answer was received by asking that the sensed Varana is the varana to remove all the faults and Indra Kriti is the destroyer of all sins
 vah avimukt kshetra devataaon kaa dev sthaan or sabhi praaniyon kaa brahm sadan he
 It is here that Lord Rudra teaches the Taraka Mantra during the time of human beings' life, due to which he attains salvation by becoming immortal
 at ev avimukt main sadaiv nivas karnaa chahie
 Never leave him, Yajnavalkya has said
 jaabalopinashad ke alaava anek smritiyon jaise likhitasmriti, shringismriti tathaa parasharasmriti, brahmisanhita tathaa sanatkumarasamhita main bhi kaashi kaa mahatmaya bataaya he
 In almost all the Puranas, the greatness of Kashi has been said
 brahmavaivart puraana main to kaashi kshetra par kaashi-rahasy naam se puraa granth hi he, jise uskaa khil bhaag kehete hai
 In the Padma Purana, kashi-mahatmya and other places also mention Kashi
 pracheen ling puraana main solah adhyay kaashi kii tirthon ke sambandh main the
 There is also a chapter in the current Lingpurana
 skanda puraana kaa kashikhand to kaashi ke tirth-swarup kaa vivechan tathaa vistrut varnan karata hi he
 Thus there is material on religious significance of Kashi in Purana literature
 iske atirikt, sanskrit-vadmay, dashakumarcharit, naishadh, rajtarangini or kuttanipatam main bhi kaashi kaa varnan aata he
 The Linga Purana, which took place till the 12th century AD, had detailed descriptions of the deviyanas and pilgrimages of Kashi from the third to the eighteenth chapter
 tristhalisetu granth kii rachana main lingapurana vaisaa hi rahaa tha
 That is, in the Lingpurana also, the lingo is described from the third to the sixteenth chapter
 vartmaan ling puraana main keval ek hi adhyay kaashi ke vishay main he, jisamen keval 144 shloke hai
 Thus, if all the Puranas are mentioned except Mahabharata, then the list of mention of Kashi's pilgrimage form becomes very long
 shabdakalpadrum me 264 tirthon kaa ullekh he, parantu mahima ke vichaar se bharat ke tirthon main chaar dham or saptpuriyon ke naam sheershasth maane jate he
 The names of Prayag, Gaya and Gangasagar do not come in them
 atah ise nakaara bhi ja saktaa he
 Numerous mythological quotations are available for the expansion of the Varanasi region
 krityakalpataru main diye tirth-vivechan va anya pracheen granthon ke anusaar: It is known from the above quotes that the expansion of ancient Varanasi was very far
 varuna ke pashchim main rajghat kaa kila jahaan pracheen varanasi ke based hone main koi andeh nahin he, ek mile lanbaa or 400 gaj chaudaa he
 The river Ganges protects its southeast mouth and the Varuna river protects the north and north-east mouths as a shallow trench, an empty drain on the west side through which the river Varuna once flowed
 raksha ke is prakritik sadhano ko dekhte hue hi shaayad pracheen kaal main varanasi nagar ke liye yah sthaan chunaa gaya
 During the first Indian freedom struggle in 1857, the British also fortified the city by raising the walls of raw mud on the high ground behind Varuna to protect the city
 puraanon main aayi varanasi kii seemaa rajghat kii ukt lambaai-chaudaai se kahin adhik he
 From those accounts, it seems that not only the boundary of the city is described, but the entire region has been included
 varuna ke us paar tak pracheen basaavaton ke avshesh kaaphi dur tak milte hai
 So it is possible that all those parts found in the Puranas have also come
 is kshetra ko yadi nagar main judaa hua maane, to puraanon main varnit nagar kii lambaai-chaudaai lagbhag sahi hi bataayi gai he
 Varanasi was the capital of Kashi district in the Mahajanapada era before the birth of Gautama Buddha
 kintu pracheen kaashi janapad ke vistaar ke bare main yatharth aadi se anumaan lagaana kathin he
 300 plans have been given to Kashi in the natives
 kaashi janapad ke uttar main kosal janapad, purv main magadh janapad or pashchim main vatsa tha
 According to the historian Dr
 Altekar, the district of Kashi extended to 250 miles towards the north-west, because its east was the neighboring district of Magadha and the north-west neighboring district was Panchal
 jataka ke anusaar kaashi or kosal kii simaaen mili hui thi
 The correct description of the southern boundary of Kashi is not available, probably because it went to the Vindhya range and there was no further population
 jaatakon ke aadhaar par kaashi kaa vistaar vartmaan baliya se kanpur tak failaa rahaa hoga
 Here Mr
 Rahul Sankrityayan says that the modern Banaras Commissionerate was the ancient Kashi district
 sambhav he ki aadhunik gorakhpur kamishnari kaa bhi kuch bhaag kaashi janapad main shaamil rahaa ho
 The establishment of the second Varanasi by King Divodas of Puru clan is mentioned in the Mahabharata and other texts
 is nagari ke bairant main hone kii sambhaavna bhi he
 According to this, according to Pandit Kubernath Sukul, the Barat ruins are on the south bank of the Baan Ganga and not on the left
 is prakaar gomti or bairant ke bich ganga kii dhara baadhak ho jaati he
 Regarding changing the course of Ganga, flowing Ganga in Baan Ganga and near ganga-gomti Sangam Saidpur, Sukulji has quoted from Mahabharata that there was Markandeya shrine at ganga-gomti Sangam, which is presently near Kathy 
 at: ye kah sakate hai ki yadi ganga-gomti sangam saidpur ke paas tha to yah mahabharat-purv ho saktaa he, na ki tritiy shatabdi isvi ke baad kaa
 The city of Varanasi is located in the central Ganges valley of northern India, on the curved banks of the left bank of the Ganges river at the eastern end of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh
