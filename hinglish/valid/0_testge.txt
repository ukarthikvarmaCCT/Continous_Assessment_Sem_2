 jab beringia astitv main tha to kshetreey mausam anukool hone kii vajah se yahan barfabaari kam hoti thi or vaataavaran madhya asia ke stapi maidaanon jaisaa tha
 Historians believe that at that time some human groups migrated from Asia and settled here

 After this, with a snow wall between Berinjia and Asia, a few thousand humans on Berinjia survived the terrible outbreak of the Ice Age without contact with other humans for almost 5,000 years

 Some historians think that the Paleolithic culture of Belgian humans at one time spanned the whole of Berinjia from the Primordia region of Siberia in the east to Alaska in the west and Hokkaido in the south

 germany main vurtsburg vishvavidhyalay ke bhautikee ke praadhyaapak wilhelm conrad rantjan ne 1895 main eksre kaa avishkaar kiya
 If the air from the glass tube is pumped out and electrified in a high voltage respectively, then the air starts to self-illuminate when the pressure is low enough
 is ghatana kaa praayogic adhyayan karte samay rantjan ne yah dekha ki vaayu kaa daab atyant alp hone par kaach kii nalika main se jo kirane aati hai, unase barium platinosynide ke manibh prakaash dene lagate hai or, nalika ko kaale kaagaj se purna rup se dhakne par bhi, paas main rakhe manibh dhyutimaan hote rahete hai
 Therefore, it was clear that the rays coming out of the esophagus could easily pass through the black paper and these rays have the special property of damaging the screen of barium platenocyanide
 vigyaan main is prakaar kii kirane tab tak gyaat nahin thim
 So these newly invented rays were named 'x-rays', but in honor of Rantzen, especially in Germany, these rays are called 'rantzen rays'

 The ions of molecules are formed due to the collisions and when these ions get to the previous state then light is emitted

 When the pressure is too low, there are not enough molecules to collide with the electrons; Therefore, the electrons come out of the minuscule and collide directly with the material with all their energy
 in sanghaton ke kaaran electranon kii teevr urja dhanagar ke parmaanuon ko mil jaati he or iskaa ek parinaam eksre kaa utpaadan hota he
 This method requires a critical pressure in the tube to produce an x-ray
 vaayu kii daab yadi is kranthik daab se adhik ho to eksre ke utpaadan ke liye paryaapt urja electranon main nahin rahati 
 On the other hand, if the pressure is less than this critical pressure, electrons are not generated, so the electric discharge stops

 Two special properties of X-rays are more important: tivrathamapan kii teen mukhya vidhiyaan hai
 The intensity of the fluorescence from the X-ray on the fluorescent screen — to the extent of the illumination — is proportional to the intensity of the X-ray
 pratidipti kii tivrata kaa anumaan karke eksre kii tivrata kii tulana sthool rup se ho sakati he
 In the second method, the action of X-ray above the photo palette is used
 eksre ke aapatan se photo pattica par jo kaalaapan aata he, vah eksre kii tivrata tathaa aapatan kaal par nirbhar rahata he
 This method allows the action of an X-ray of greater intensity to take place at the appropriate place on a photo plate with a higher intensity of the X-ray beam, and then the action of the second X-ray beam on the same plaque down t, 2t
 , 3t etc
 pattica ko viksit karne ke pashchaat donon chitron ke kaalepan kii tulana karne se donon punjon kii saapeksh tivrata kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 The third method of intensity measurement is more prevalent, because intensity can be measured precisely in this manner
 jab eksre vaayu main se jaati he tab vaayu vidyucchalak ho jaati he or uski chaalakata eksre kii tivrata par nirbhar rahati he
 The electrons of air molecules are displaced by the action of X-rays and ions are produced
 uchit vidyudvibhav kii upasthiti main yanon se jo vidyuddhara praapt hoti he, vah samvedi vidyunmapi se, athwa anya uchit samvedi upkarnon se, maapi ja sakati he
 The intensity of the x-ray is proportional to the electrode
 haal main gunak-prakashanalika or eksre-samvedi sphur ke upyog se tivrata kaa maapan atyant sulabh ho gaya he
 Similarly, the stream of ionization can also be easily measured with the help of a gelatinizer
 at: vartmaankaal main in donon prakaar ke upkarnon dwaara eksre kii tivrata kaa maapan adhik prachlit he
 These three popular methods of intensity measurement can only compare the intensities of the two x-ray elements, the absolute intensity cannot be achieved
 apati eksre ke lambavat ek varg centimetre kshetrafal par prati senkad jo urja padati he, usko vastut: ham us eksre kii tivrata kah sakate hai
 This intensity is expressed in ergs per square centimeter per second
 tivrata kaa maapan urja ke rup main karne ke liye eksre kii urja ko ushma atyant alp hone ke kaaran is reeti se tivrathamapan ke liye atyant sookshmagrahi vishisht upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In this manner, Terrill made the first attempt to intensify
 iske pashchaat 1953 i
 main america main ilinay vishvavidhyalay ke henderson, beati evam laafan ne bhi praytn kiye
 The intensity of the x-ray generated by very high current can only be measured in this way
 bhautikee ke praayogic kaaryo main sadaa ekakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or maapi gai raashi ke anusaar iskaa swaroop hota he
 The unit of X-ray quantity is called 'rantzen' and in the present tense the definition of a Rantzen is as follows- eksre kaa doosraa vishesh gundharm unki thos padaartho main praveshkshmata he
 The decrease in the intensity of the X-ray is not the same when the different solids are passed through the same mass
 kuch thos padaartho main eksre kaa avasorana adhik hota he ore kuch padaartho main kam
 The result of this experiment is that if the x-ray crosses the different mots of a particular solid, then the output x-ray is related to the intensity, initial intensity and thickness of the solid according to the following equation: log = – m × motaai --- Here = initial intensity of x-ray; i = thos padaarth main se paar hone ke pashchaat eksre kii tivrata; m = a constant, called the absorption multiplier
 is sthiraank ko us thos vishesh eksre-avasorana-gunak kehete hai
 In fact it is a linear multiplier
 isko vyapak rup main vyakt karne ke liye main us thos padaarth ke ghanatv kaa bhaag diya jaataa he or is prakaar praapt avasorana gunank ko 'sanhati-avasorana-gunank' kehete hai
 Therefore mmass = m / ghanatv The special significance of the Samhita-absorption-multiplier is that it is the characteristic property of the absorbing material
 udaahranarth, jal or bhaap kaa rekhiy avasorana-gunak bhinn hota he, kyonki jal drav he or bhaap gas hai
 But the x-ray code-absorption-coefficient of water and steam is the same, because the chemical preservatives of water and steam are integral, namely, hydrogen and oxygen
 prakaash or eksre ke gundharmo kii bhinnata sanhati-avasorana-gunak se atyant spasht ho jaati he
 Generally, liquids and solids are themselves opaque or translucent to light
 prakaash ke liye hira paardarshee or graphite apaardarshee he, parantu eksre kaa sanhati-avasorana-gunank hira tathaa graphite ke liye samaan hi rahata he, kyonki ye donon padaarth vastut: carbon ke hi vibhinn swaroop hai
 Absorption coefficients of the entire X-rays from the X-ray tube are mainly dependent on both the electrical current and the atomic number of the metal of the absorber screen
 jaise jaise vibhav badhata jaataa he vaise hi vaise utpaadit eksre kii praveshkshmata athwa kathorta badhati jaati he
 The equation leads to the conclusion that the absorption multiplier for a single solid will be constant for all the masses
 kintu pratyaksh prayog main eksre nalika se praapt vikiran kaa nune praveshkshamtawala bhaag avasorak parade ke pratham staron main hi purnataya avashoshit ho jaataa he 
 Only X-rays of high penetrability reach the final levels of the absorption screen
 spasht he ki avasorana parade main pravesh karanevaale eksre kaa avasorana gunank parade se paar nikle hue eksre ke avasorana gunak se adhik hota he
 When the absorption multiplier of all x-rays is the same, then they are called homogeneous x-rays
 at: eksre kii maatra unki tivrata se or unki visheshta unke avasorana-gunak se maapit hota he
 We can see the matter from which light comes, because light rays have an action on the design of our eye
 is prakaar kii kriya eksre dwaara nahin hoti, at: eksre drishy nahin hai
 Not only this, the action of each other on the eyes and other parts of the body is very harmful
 jivit koshaaon par eksre kii paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se ve mritt ho jaati hai
 X-rays easily cross through the skin and they are likely to die due to their long-term action on the living cells within
 phir, eksre ke prabhaav tikaoo hote he; at: sharir ke ek hi sthaan par bhinn-bhinn samayon par bhi eksre kii kriya hoti rahane par kuch kaal main cancer sadrush du:saadhy rog ho jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to work very carefully while using X-ray
 sharir kii raksha ke liye vishesh saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 In addition, current x-ray users keep an x-ray-measure in their pocket in the present tense, which shows how much radiation has worked on the employee
 eksre ke is ghaatak gundharm kaa anya rogon main upyog bhi kiya jaataa he; jaise, sharir ke kisi bhaag main anisht roganuon kii vruddhi hoti ho to unpar eksre kaa prayog karke unhen nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 X-rays are used more in medicine, especially in surgery
 is prakaar ke upyog kii sambhaavna eksre ke avishkaar ke samay se hi spasht thi
 Different elements of the body have different absorption-multipliers; Therefore, by taking an x-ray from any part of the body and taking a photo, the bones and other components are seen separately
 at: shalya kriya ke purv, athwa yah gyaat karne ke liye ki rog kis avasthaa main he eksre photo atyant upyogi hote hai
 As the production of X-rays progressed, they started to be used in industries as well, and in the present times the use of X-rays in metallurgy has become necessary
 urja yaa to kanon ke saath athwa tarangon ke saath sanyukt rahati he
 If energy is emitted from an origin, the existence of this energy is usually expressed in the intensity of electromagnetic waves, or as the kinetic energy of particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, ions etc
 tarang or kan ke swaroop bhinn hote hai; isliye inako saadhaarant: bhinn virgo main rakhaa jaataa he
 But it has become clear from the results of many experiments that the bonding of these classes has properties of particles in waves and, conversely, particles also have properties of waves

 As the x-ray wavelength is much less than the wavelength of light, there are many difficulties in using experiments for x-rays, by which the wavelength of light can be easily measured

 shivakataksh ek aushadhiy paudha he
 This plant is found in abundance in Madhya Pradesh
 shivakataksh ke paudhe main bahut tikhe kaante hote hai
 It also has religious significance
 shiv ji kii puja karte samay is paudhe ke phool shivlinga par chadhaaye jate hai
 Its flowers are yellow and white in color
 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavad Gita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular
 iskaa prakaashan gitapress ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Aaj Tak has sold 100 million copies
 shrimadbhagavadgita badalte saamaajik paridrishyon main apni mahatta ko banaae hue hai or isi kaaran takneekee vikaas ne isaki uplabdhta ko badhaayaa he, tathaa adhik bodhgamy banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world
 gita press gorakhpur jaisi dharmik sahitya kii pustakon ko kaaphi kam mulya par uplabdh karaane vaale prakaashan ne bhi kai aakaar main arth or bhashya ke saath shrimadbhagavadgita ke prakaashan dwaara ise aam janata tak pahunchane main kaaphi yogadan diya he
 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he
 This perfect man is the ultimate state and ultimate truth
 yahi nahin, deh main sthit or deh tyagkar jate hue jeevatma kii gati kaa yatharth vaigyanik env tarksangat varnan gita shaastra main hua he
 The soul is eternal and the soul has attained the spirit of life
 sharir ke mar jane par jeevatma apane karmanusaar vibhinn yoniyon main vicharan karata he
 The Gita begins with the word Dharma and at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita it is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he dhaaran karne vaala athwa jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he
 The word Dharma is used in the Gita from place to place for self-nature and living nature
 isi paripeksh main dharm evam adharm ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The nature of the soul is religion or it is said that religion is spirit
 aatma kaa swabhaav he purna shuddh gyaan, gyaan hi anand or shaanti kaa akshay dham he
 On the contrary, ignorance signifies unrest, tribulation and unrighteousness
 aatma akshay gyaan kaa strot he
 Kriya Shakti arises from different amounts of knowledge power, birth of nature
 prakruti ke gun satva, raj, tam kaa janm hota he
 Excess of sattva-raja gives rise to religion, demonic circles prevail in excess of tam-raja and the establishment of dharma means to establish the nature of virtues, for the growth of satoguna, soul attaining indestructible Brahmi status, its resolve She incarnates herself and performs incarnation

 ek microphone ] kaha jaataa he) ek dhvanik-se-vaidyut transdusar yaa samvedak hota he, jo dhwani ko vidyutiya sanket main roopantarit karata he
 In 1876, Emily Berliner invented the first microphone, which was used as a telephone voice transmitter
 microphonon kaa prayog anek anuprayogon, jaise telephone, tepe ricorder, karaoke pranaaliyon, shravan-sahaayta yantron, chalchitron ke nirmaan, sajiv tathaa ricard kii gai sraavya ejineering, FRS radio, megaphone, radio va televijan prasaaran or computaron main awaz ricard karne, swar kii pahchaan karne, voip tathaa kuch gaiyr-dhvanik uddeshyon, jaise ultrasonic pareekshan yaa dastak samvedakon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Most microphones currently used use an electromagnetic actuation, capacitance change, piezovascular construction or light modulation to generate an electric charge signal from mechanical vibration
 kisi microphone ke samvedansheel transdusar tatv ko iskaa tatv yaa capsule kaha jaataa he
 An entire microphone also includes a structure, a means of bringing signals from one element to another device, and often an electrical circuit to optimize the output of the capsule to the device being operated
 microphonon kaa ullekh unke transdusar siddhant, jaise sanghnitr, gatij aadi, ke dwaara tathaa unki dishaatmak visheshtaon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Some other features are sometimes used to describe a microphone, such as the diaphragm size, intended use, or orientation from the main axis of the microphone to the main source of sound
 ek sanghnitr microphone, jise sandharitra microphone yaa vidyutsthaitik microphone bhi kehete hai, main madhyapat sandharitra kii ek plate ke rup main kaary karata he or kampan in platon ke bich antar ko parivartit karata he
 There are two methods to obtain audible output from a transducer thus constructed: dc-biased and radio frequency or high frequency condenser microphones
 In a dc-introduced microphone, the plates are enacted with a constant charge
 sandharitra platon ke paar anurakshit voltage hawa main hone vaale companon ke saath dharita sutara ke anusaar parivartit hota he, jahaan, Q= culumb main mapa jane vaala aavesh, C= fared main maapi jane vaali dharita or V= volt main mapa jane vaala sambhavit antar hai
 For a parallel-plate capacitor, the capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to the difference between them
 sthir or chalyman platon kii asembli ko ek "tatv" yaa capsule kaha jaataa he
 a nearly constant charge is maintained on the capacitor
 jaise-jaise dharita badalati jaati he, sandharitra par upasthit is aavesh main bhi bahut thodaa parivartan hota jaataa he, lekin suni ja sakanevaali aavritiyon par yah samuchit rup se sthir hi bana rahata he
 Tens of gigaohms by the capacitance of the capsule and the value of the biased resistor) forming a filter that is high-cross for the sound signals and low-cross for the applied voltage
 dhyaan den ki ek RC paripath kaa samay sthiraank pratirodh or dharita ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 Within the time-limit of the capacitance change, the charge is experimentally stable and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance
 sandharitra par upasthit voltage abhinath voltage se upar or neeche parivartit hota rahata he
 The voltage difference between the inductance and the capacitor is reflected on the resistive resistor
 pratirohak par sthit voltage ko pradarshan yaa recording ke liye parivardhit kiya jaataa he
 RF condenser microphones use relatively low RF voltages, which are generated by a low-noise oscillator
 yah dolak capsule ke madhyapat ko hilaanevaali dhwani tarangon dwaara utpann dharita parivartan dwaara aayam aaparivartit hota he yaa yah capsule ek gunjyman paripath, jo dolak sanket kii aavriti ko aaparivartit karata he, kaa bhaag bhi ho sakati he
 Demodulation provides a low-noise sound-frequency signal with very low source impedance

 The process of RF resonance results in the form of a low electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which RF condenser microphones can also be operated in damp-weather conditions, which is a problem with dc-centering microphones
 Can produce resistant surfaces that have been contaminated
 The sensing "MKH" series of microphones uses RF recognition technology

 An electret microphone is a relatively new type of capacitor microphone, introduced by Gerhard Seussler and Jim West in 1962 at Bell Laboratories
 upar sanghnitr microphone ke antargat varnit bahari rup se lagu kiya gaya aavesh ek elactrate padaarth main ek sthai aavesh ke dwaara pratisthapit kiya jaataa he
 An electret is an iron-electric material, which is permanently electrically charged or wavered
 yah naam electrostatic or magnet ke milakar bana he; padaarth main sthir aaveshon ke sarekhan ke dwaara ek elactre t main ek sthir aavesh joda jaataa he, jo ki lagbhag vaisaa hi hota he, jaise lohe ke kisi tukade main chumbakeey kshetra ke sarekhan dwaara chumbak kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 Most of the present-day microphones are electret microphones due to their good performance and ease of production and consequently low cost; The annual estimate of a semiconductor producer is more than one billion units
 lagbhag sabhi cell-phone, computer, PDA tathaa hedset microphone elactrate prakaar ke hai
 They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and lavalier use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones
 yadhyapi kisi samay elactrate microphonon ko kam gunvattta vaale samajha jaataa tha, lekin aaj is shrenee ke sarvshereshth microphone prayek kshetra main paaramparik sanghnitr microphone se pratispardhaa kar sakate hai or ve lambii avadhi tak kii sthirataa or kisi maapan microphone ke liye aavashyak atyant-spasht pratikriya bhi de sakate hai
 Unlike other capacitor microphones, they do not require any polarization voltage, but often have an integrated pre-amplifier, which is said to require electric power)
 It often receives power through pre-amplifier phantoms for sound recharging and studio applications
 personal computer ke liye nirmit microphone, jinhen kabhi-kabhi multimedia microphone kaha jaataa he, ek sterio 3

 Also, their potentially high attainment prior to feedback makes them ideal for use on stage
 gatiman kundalee vaale microphone bhi laudspikar jaise hi gatij siddhant kaa prayog karte hai, lekin vah vipareet hota he
 a small moving actuation coil, which is placed in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, is attached to the diaphragm
 jab dhwani microphone ke vatarodhi shishe se pravesh karti he, to dhwani tarangen madhyapat ko hilaati hai
 When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves into the magnetic field, causing a changing electric current in the coil through electromagnetic actuation
 ek ekal gatij pardaa sabhi dhwani aavritiyon ke prati rekhiy rup se pratikriya nahin dete
 isi kaaran kuch microphonon main dhwani spectrum ke vibhinn bhaagon ke liye anek pardon kaa prayog krate hai or iske baad parinamit sanketon ko sanyojit karte hai

 vahiin duusari ore, vibhinn anya rachanaaen vishisht rup se dhwani spectrum ke pruthakkrut bhaagon par kendrit hoti hai
 For example, AKG d 112 is designed to respond to the mandra-vowel rather than the high-vowel
 dhwani ejineering main sarvshereshth parinaam praapt karne ke liye aksar vibhinn prakaar ke microphonon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The ribbon microphone uses a thin, usually shrunken metal ribbon, which is delayed in a magnetic field
 yah riban vidyutiya rup se microphone ke output se judi hoti he or chumbakeey kshetra ke bheetar iskaa kampan vidyutiya sanket utpann karata he
 Ribbon microphones and moving coil microphones are similar in the context that both of them produce sound through magnetic actuation
 buniyadi riban microphone ek dwidishaatmak pattern main dhwani kii pahchaan karte hai kyonki riban, jo ki saamne or peeche, donon ore se dhwani ke liye khuli hoti he, dhwani ke daab ke bajaay daab pravanta ke prati pratikriya dete hai
 Although symmetric pick-up at the front and rear can be a problem in normal stereo recording, high-field rejection can be used to an advantage when placing the ribbon microphone indiscriminately, for example over the kartal
 Can, so that the previous cloak takes only the sound coming over the kartal
 8 ke aakaar par rekhit yaa bluemalin joda, sterio recording lokapriy hoti ja rahi he or kisi riban microphone kii aakaar 8 pratikriya us anuprayog ke liye adarsh hoti he
 Other directional patterns are generated by inserting a part of the ribbon into an acoustic-mesh or resistor, allowing the sound to reach only one part

 Older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide very high quality sound reproduction, were once considered valuable for the same reason, but a good low-frequency response can only be achieved if the ribbon is too light
 The manner is delayed and this has made them fragile
 naye nainopadaarthon sahit ab aise aadhunik riban padaarth prastut kiye gayi hai, jo in samasyaon ko dur karte hai or yahaan tak nimna aavritiyon par riban microphonon kii prabhavi gatij seemaa main sudhaar bhi karte hai
 The defensive windpipe can reduce the risk of damage to a specific ribbon, as well as reduce tactile artifacts in recordings
 upyukt rup se rachit vaat-patal naganya ucch-swar kshinan utpann karte hai
 In other categories of kinetic microphones generally, ribbon microphones do not require phantom electric power; In fact, this voltage can damage some old ribbon microphones
 kuch nae aadhunik riban microphone dizine ek purv-pravardhak ko sammilit karte hai or atah inamen fantom shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or aadhunik apratyaksh riban microphonon, arthath ve jinamein uparokt varnit purv-pravardhak nahin hote, ke paripath vishisht rup se fantom vidyut-shakti dwaara riban tathaa parivartak ko hone vaali kshati ko rokane ke liye banaae jate hai
 Also, some new ribbons are also available, which are resistant to wind blasts and phantom electric power
 berlinner or edison microphonon jaisaa ek carbon microphone ek capsule yaa batan kaa prayog karata he, jisamen dhaatu kii do platon ke bich carbon kanikaayen dabi hui hoti hai
 a voltage is applied across these metal plates, allowing a small amount of electric current to flow through the carbon
 inamen se ek plate, madhyapat, sanyogit dhwani tarangon ke saath compit hoti he or carbon main badalata hua daab lagu karti he
 This changing pressure deforms these granules, thereby changing the area of contact between each pair of adjacent granules and thereby changing the electrical resistance of the mass of the granules

 In the real world, this is not true
 dishaatmak microphonon kii hi tarah, kisi "sarvadishaatmak" microphone ke liye bhi dhruviya pattern aavriti kaa hi ek kaary hota he
 The structure of the microphone is not infinitely small and, as a result, when the sound is coming from behind, it automatically shifts between its passages, causing some dispersion in the polar response
 jab microphone kaa vyas vichaarit aavriti ke tarang-dairdhya tak pahunchane lagata he, to yah failaav badhata jaataa he
 Hence the microphone with the smallest diameter provides the best omnidirectional features at high frequencies

 a super-cardioid microphone is also similar to a hyper-cardioid, with the only difference being that the front pick-up is higher and the rear pick-up is lower
 aamtaur par in teen prakaaron kaa prayog vaachik yaa bhaashan ke liye prayukt microphonon ke rup main kiya jaataa he kyonki ve anya dishaao se aane vaali dhvaniyon ko upekshit kar paane main bahut acchhee tarah sakasham hote hai
 a cardioid microphone is an omnidirectional and an effective modality of a size-8 microphone; For sound waves coming from the back, a negative sign of size-8 cancels the positive signal of the omnidirectional element, whereas for sound waves coming from the front, these two join each other
 ek hyperkaradod microphone bhi aisa hi hota he, lekin isamen yogadan aakaar-8 kii tulana main kuch bada hota he
 Since pressure gradient transducer microphones are directional, placing them too close to the sound source results in an increase in the mono-tone
 ise nikatataa prabhaav kehete hai
 "size-8" or bi-directional microphones receive sound from both the front and back of an element
 adhikansh riban microphone isi prakaar ke hote hai
 Shotgun microphones are the most highly directional

 This is due to placing the element at the end of the tube and the grooves cut from the side; Wave cancellation removes most of the sound coming from far away from the axis
 unke samvedansheeltaa kshetra ke sankarepan ke kaaran, shotgan microphonon kaa prayog aamtaur par televijan or film seton par, khel ke maidaanon main or vanya-jivan kii kshetra recording ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Various methods have been developed to use microphones effectively in less-than-ideal acoustic locations, often prone to excessive reflections coming from one or more surfaces that make up that space
 yadi microphone ko inamen se kisi seemaa ke bheetar, yaa uske bahut nikat, rakhaa gaya ho, to us sataha se aane vaale ye paravartan microphone dwaara pahachaane nahin jate
 prarambh main, yah kaary ek saamaanya microphone ko sataha ke saath, kabhi-kabhi dhvanik rup se paardarshee fom ke ek khand main, rakhkar kiya jaataa tha
 Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Vickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to the boundary
 Although their patent has expired, "pressure zone microphone" and "PZM" still remain active trademarks of Crown International, and the use of the general terminology "boundary microphone" is preferred
 yadhyapi ek boundry microphone ko prarambh main ek sarvadishaatmak tatv kii sahaayta se kriyanvit kiya jaataa tha, lekin kisi dishaatmak microphone ko sataha ke paryaapt nikat rakhkar us tatv kii dishaatmak visheshtaon ko banaae rakhte hue is takanic ke kuch laabh hasil kar paanaa bhi sambhav he
 Crown's trademark for this method is "face Coherent Cardioid" or "PCC", but some other manufacturers also use this technique
 ek lavelior microphone hast-mukt sanchaalan ke liye banaaya jaataa he
 These small microphones are worn on the body
 multah unhen ek sthaan par rakhane ke liye gardan ke chaaron ore bandhi ek dori ke saath pahana jaataa tha, lekin unhen aksar kisi clip, pin, tepe yaa chumbak kii sahaayta se kapadon ke saath chipkaaya jaataa he
 Lavalier lanyard can be disguised by clothing and can be placed in a pocket or stuck in a belt to the RF transmitter or directly to the mixer
 ek betaar microphone kisi taar ke madhyam se bhejne ke bajaay dhwani ko radio yaa prakaashiya sanket ke rup main prasaarit karata he
 Generally it sends its signal to a nearby receiver connected to the sound system using a small FM radio transmitter, but it can also use infrared light if the transmitter and receiver are within each other's range of sight
 hawa ke madhyam se sanchaarit hone vaale dhwani compano ke vipareet ek sampark microphone sidhe kisi thos sataha yaa kisi padaarth se kampan grahan karata he
 One of its uses is to identify very low-level sounds, such as sounds coming from a small substance or a worm
 saamanytah yah microphone ek chumbakeey transdusar, sampark plate or sampark pin se milakar banataa he
 The contact plate is placed in front of the material from which vibrations emanate; The contact pin transfers these vibrations to the coil of the transducer
 sampark microphone kaa prayog ghonghe ke dil kii dhadkan or chintiyon ke pairon kii awaz ko grahan karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Recently, a portable version of this microphone has been developed

 Parabolic microphones are not specifically used for standard recording applications because they provide weak response to low-frequency, which is a side effect of their design
 ek sterio microphone do microphonon ko ek ikai main ekikrut karata he, taaki ek steriophonic sanket utpann kiya ja sake
 ek sterio microphone kaa prayog aksar prasaaran anuprayogon yaa kshetra recording ke liye tab kiya jaataa he, jab steriophonic recording ke liye paaramparik X-Y sanrupan main do pruthak sanghanitron ko sanrupit karnaa avyaavhaarik ho
 aise kuch microphonon main do channelon ke bich kaaryakshetra vyapti kaa samyojya kone hota he
 a noise cancellation microphone is a highly directional design, designed for noisy environments
 aisa ek prayog vayuyanon ke cockpit main hota he, jahaan ve saamanytah hedseton par boom microphonon ke rup main santhaapit kiye jate hai
 Another use of these is for singers on the stage of high-pitched music festivals
 anek shor nirastikaran microphone vipareet vidyutiya dhruvan main sthit yaa vidyutiya rup se prasanskrit do madhyapaton se praapt sanketon ko sanyojit karte hai
 In a double diaphragm design, the main diaphragm is installed at the closest distance from the intended source and the other one is placed far away from the source, so that it can capture the atmospheric sound that is to be subtracted from the signal of the main diaphragm
 do sanketon ko sanyojit kar diye jane par, abhisht strot ke alaava anya sroton se aane vaali dhvaniyaan bahut kam ho jaati hai, jisase use behatar dhang se samajha ja saktaa he
 Other noise-canceling designs use the same diaphragm, which is influenced by the port opening to the side and back of the microphone, which results in a 16 db cancellation of distant sounds
 ek ekal madhyapat kaa prayog karke ek shor-nirastikaran hedset dizine kaa upyog mukhyatah gayak kalakaaron, jaise garth brookes or janet jackson, dwaara kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Some noise-canceling microphones are jugular microphones

 kuch lavelior ') microphone ek betaar transmeter se sangyojan ke liye ek malikana sanyojitr kaa prayog karte hai
 Since 2005, commercial-quality microphones with USB connections have begun to emerge, designed for direct recording in computer-based software
 microphonon main pratibaadha naamak ek vidyutiya visheshta hoti he, jise ohm main mapa jaataa he or jo dizine par nirbhar hoti he
 Typically, the rated impedance is stated
 600 ω se kam pratibaadha ko nimna pratibaadha mana jaataa he
 a mid impedance between 600 ω and 10 kω is considered
 10 kω se upar ucch pratibaadha hoti he
 (named after condenser microphones) typically have output impedances between 50 and 200 ohms
 pratibaadha nimna yaa ucch hone par bhi kisi microphone kaa output samaan shakti prastut karata he
 If a microphone is built in high- and low-impedance versions, the high-impedance variant for a specific sound pressure input has a higher output voltage and is used in vacuum-nozzled guitar amplifiers, for example, which have a higher input impedance
 And require a relatively high signal input voltage to suppress the noise inherent in the nozzles It is suitable for use with
 adhikansh vyavsaayik microphonon main nimna pratibaadha, lagbhag 200 ω yaa kam, hoti he
 Professional vacuum-tube sound devices include a transformer, which increases the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage required to operate the input nozzles
 bahari milan transformar bhi uplabdh hai, jinka prayog ek nimna pratibaadha vaale microphone or ek ucch pratibaadha vaale input ke bich ek sidh main kiya ja saktaa he
 Low-impedance microphones are preferred over high-impedance microphones for two reasons: The first is that a high-impedance microphone with a long wire results in a high-frequency signal loss due to the capacitance of the wire, Which produces a low-pass filter with microphone output impedance
 doosraa kaaran yah he ki ucch-pratibaadha vaale lambey taar adhik bhinbhinaahat ) bhi) grahan karte hai
 There is no loss if the impedance match between the microphone and the other device goes wrong; The worst results occur as a decrease in signal or a change in frequency response
 adhikansh microphone is prakaar dizine kiye jate hai ki unki pratibaadha kaa milan us bhaar ke saath na ho sake, jisase ve jude hue hai
 Doing so can alter their frequency response, causing distortion, especially at high sound pressure levels

 The AES 42 standard published by the Audio Engineering Society defines a digital interface for microphones
 is maanak kaa paalan karne vaale microphone ek analog output utpann karne ke bajaay ek XLR nar sanyojitr ke madhyam se sidhe digital audio dhara utpann karte hai
 Digital microphones can be used with new devices with appropriate input combinations that follow the AES 42 standard, or through a suitable interface box
 AES 42 maanak ke anusaar kaary karne vaale studio gunvattta vaale microphone ab anek microphone utpaadakon se uplabdh hai
 Due to differences in the composition of microphones, they have their own specific responses to sound
 pratikriya main yah antar asmaan charan or aavriti pratikriyaayein utpann karata he
 Additionally, microphones are also not equally sensitive to sound pressure and can accept different levels without distortion
 haalanki vaigyanik anuprayogon ke liye adhik samanta vaale microphone vaanchhneeya hote hai, lekin aksar sangeet recording ke liye yah baat lagu nahin hoti kyonki microphone kii asmaan pratikriya dhwani kaa vaanchhneeya ranjan utpann kar sakati he
 There is also an international standard of microphone specifications, but very few manufacturers follow it
 iske parinamswaroop, vibhinn nirmaataaon dwaara prakashit data kii tulana karnaa kathin hota he kyonki ve bhinn-bhinn maapan takneekon kaa prayog karte hai
 The Microphone Data website has collected technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves, and technical data from microphone manufacturers for each microphone currently listed, and even for some obsolete models, and data about them all for the purpose of comparison is a Is displayed in the normal format
 
 haalanki, is yaa kisi bhi anya prakashit data se koi pakkaa nishkarsh nikaalte samay saavdhaanee baratani chaiye, jab tak ki yah gyaat na ho ki utpaadak ne ye vinirdesh IEC 60268-4 ke anuroop pradaan kiye hai
 a frequency response diagram puts microphone sensitivity into decibels for a range of frequencies, usually accurately located on the axis

 isaki vyakhya varnit aavritiyon ke bich ek lagbhag samtal, rekhiy, plot ke rup main kii jaati he, jisamen aayam main newnaadhik antar 3 db se adhik nahin he
 However, based on this information, we cannot determine how seamless these differences are, nor in which part of the spectrum they occur
 dhyaan den ki aamtaur par banaae jane vaale kathan, jaise "20 Hz–20 khz", sahansheeltaa ke ek desibel maapan ke bina arthhin hote hai
 The frequency response of directional microphones varies greatly with the difference from the sound source and the geometry of the sound source
 IEC 60268-4 ke anusaar aavriti pratikriya sapaat pragatisheel tarang sthitiyon main maapi jaani chahie, lekin yah kabhi-kabhi hi vyaavhaarik hota he
 Closed-talk microphones can be measured with different sound sources and distances, but there is no standard and therefore there is no way to compare data from different models if the measurement technique is not described
 swa-shor yaa samakaksh shor str dhwani kaa vah str he, jo utana hi output voltage utpann karata he, jitna microphone dwaara dhwani kii anupasthiti main utpann kiya jaataa he
 It represents the lowest point of the kinetic range of the microphone and is especially important when you want to record quiet sounds
 This measurement is often described in db, which is the equivalent loudness of noise at a decibel measurement frequency — which is weighted for how the ears listen, for example: "15 dba SPL"
 The lower the value, the better
 kuch microphone nirmaataa ITU-R 468 shor bhaaran kaa prayog karke shor str kaa varnan karte hai, jo ki adhik sateek rup se yah vyakt karata he ki ham dhwani ko kis prakaar sunate hai, lekin yah ek 11-14 db ucchtar maan pradaan karata he
 An fixed microphone typically measures 20 dba SPL or 32 db SPL 468-loading

 Compassionate distortion from microphones is generally low-grade type and, therefore, even at 3–5%, it is not very audible
 On the other hand, clipping, which occurs when the diaphragm reaches its full displacement limit, produces a hoarse sound at its higher levels and should be avoided as far as possible
 For some microphones the clipping level may be much higher than the maximum SPL
 shor dharaatal or adhiktam SPL ke bich SPL main antar ko kisi microphone kii gatij seemaa kaha jaataa he
 If provided by it itself, for example "120 db", it provides significantly less information than the self-noise and maximum SPL data are described independently
 samvedansheeltaa is baat ko suchit karti he ki ek microphone dhvanik daab ko kitni acchhee tarah output voltage main roopantarit karata he
 a high sensitivity microphone produces more voltage and therefore requires less amplification on the mixer or recording equipment

 a higher value indicates higher sensitivity
 puraani amareeki vidhi ek 1 v / Pa maanak kaa ullekh karti he or use sapaat desibels main mapa jaataa he, jiskaa parinaam ek rinatmak maan ke rup main miltaa he
 Again a higher value indicates higher sensitivity, so the sensitivity of -60 db is greater than -70 db

 Sound intensity or sound power measurements require pressure-gradient measurements, which are typically made using a series of at least two microphones or with hot-wire windmills
 ek microphone kii sahaayta se koi vaigyanik maapan lene ke liye, isaki spasht samvedansheeltaa gyaat hona anivaary hota he
 Since this can change over the life of the device, it is mandatory to calibrate measurement microphones regularly
 kuch microphone utpaadakon dwaara or swatantra pramanit pareekshan prayogshaalaon dwaara yah seva pradaan kii jaati he
 All microphone calibrations at a national measurement institution, such as NPL in the UK, PTB in Germany, and NIST in the USA, are eventually detectable by primary standards, most commonly calibrated using the reciprocity primary standard

 Depending on the application, measurement microphones must be tested periodically and in the event of any potential damage event, such as after a drop or when encountering sounds beyond acceptable levels
 ek pistonphone kisi band yugmak kaa prayog karke microphone ke anshshodhan ke liye ek spasht dhwani daab ko utpann karne hetu ek dhvanik anshashodhak hota he
 This principle relies on the mechanically driven piston pushing a certain volume of air, at a specific cyclic rate, to which the microphone being tested is exposed

 The pistonphone method works only at low frequencies, but can be infallible and provides a sound pressure level that can be easily represented
 saamanytah maanak pareekshan aavriti lagbhag 250 Hz hoti he
 This method relies on the reciprocity of one or more microphones in a group of 3 microphones to be calibrated

 An extremely common example of an optional accessory airtight mirror is the A2WS manufactured by Shure, one of which is worn on each of the two Shure SM57 microphones used on the text-stage of the President of the United States
 poliurithane fom microphone aavarnon kii ek kami yah he ki ve samay bitne ke saath kharaab hote jate hai
 Airtight mirrors also collect dust and moisture in their open holes and must be cleaned to protect the person using the microphone from high frequency loss, bad odor, and unhealthy conditions
 On the other hand, the main advantage of a function singer airtight mirror is that it can quickly replace a clean airtight mirror among users, reducing the possibility of germs spreading

 Mahashivratri is a major festival of Hindus
 yah bhagwaan shiv kaa pramukh parv he
 Phalgun Krishna Chaturdashi is celebrated Shivaratri festival
 mana jaataa he ki sristi kaa prarambh isi din se hua
 According to mythology, the creation of this day began with the rise of Agnilinga
 adhik tar log yah manyata rakhte he ki isi din bhagwaan shiv kaa vivaah devi parvati ke saath hua tha
 Mahashivaratri is considered to be the most important of the 12 Shivaratris that occur in the year
 kashmir shaiva mat main is tyohaar ko har-raatri or bolchaal main 'herath' yaa 'herath' bhi jaataa he
 There are many mythological stories related to Mahashivaratri: mahashivaratri ke din bhagwaan shiv ne kalkut naamak vish ko apane kanth main rakh liya tha
 Which came out at the time of churning the sea
 ek baar parvati ji ne bhagwaan shivashankar se poocha, 'aisa koun-sa shreshth tathaa saral vrath-pujan he, jisase mrityulok ke praani aapaki krupa sahaj hi praapt kar lete hai?' uttar main shivaji ne parvati ko 'shivaratri' ke vrath kaa vidhaan bataakar yah katha sunai- 'ek baar chitrabhanu naamak ek shikari tha
 He raised his family by killing animals
 vah ek sahuukaar kaa rini tha, lekin uskaa rin samay par na chukaa sakaa
 The angry moneylender captives the hunter at Shivamath
 sanyog se us din shivaratri thi
 ' shikari dhyanamgn hokar shiv-sambandhi dharmik baaten sunata rahaa
 He also heard the story of Shivaratri fast on Chaturdashi
 sandhya hote hi sahuukaar ne use apane paas bulaayaa or rin chukaane ke vishay main baat kii
 The hunter left the bond the next day, promising to return the loan
 apni dincharya kii bhaanti vah jangal main shikaar ke liye niklaa
 But due to being in captivity all day, he was disturbed by hunger and thirst
 shikaar karne ke liye vah ek talab ke kinare bel-vriksh par padaav banane laga
 Under the vine tree was the Shivling which was covered with villas
 shikari ko uskaa pataa na chalaa
 The twigs he broke while making the halt fell on the Shivling by chance
 is prakaar dinabhar bhukhe-pyaase shikari kaa vrath bhi ho gaya or shivlinga par belptr bhi chadh gaye
 At one o'clock in the night, a pregnant lady came to drink water at the pond
 shikari ne dhanush par tir chadhaakar jyon hi pratyancha khinchi, mrigi boli, 'main garbhini hum
 Will deliver soon tum ek saath do jeevon kii hatya karoge, jo thik nahin he
 i will give birth to a child and will be presented to you soon, then kill it
 ' shikari ne pratyancha dhili kar di or mrigi junglee jhaadiyon main lupt ho gai
 Shortly after, another antelope emerged from there
 shikari kii prasannataa kaa thikaana na rahaa
 After coming close, he put the bow on the arrow
 tab use dekh mrigi ne vinamratapurvak nivedan kiya, 'he pardhi! main thodi der pehle ritu se nivrutt hui hum
 i am lustful
 apane priy kii khoj main bhatak rahi hum
 i will meet my husband and come to you soon
 ' shikari ne use bhi jane diya
 He was perturbed over losing his prey twice
 vah chintaa main pad gaya
 The last hour of the night was passed
 tabhi ek anya mrigi apane bacchon ke saath udhar se nikali
 It was a golden opportunity for hunters
 usne dhanush par tir chadhaane main der nahin lagaai
 He was about to drop the arrow that the antelope said, 'O Pardhi!' i will return these children to their father
 is samay mujhe mat maaro
 The hunter laughed and said, leave the victim in front, i am not such a fool
 isse pehle main do baar apana shikaar kho chukaa hum
 My children must be suffering from hunger and thirst
 uttar main mrigi ne phir kaha, jaise tumhen apane bacchon kii mamata sata rahi he, thik vaise hi mujhe bhi
 Therefore, in the name of children, i am seeking life for a while
 he pardhi! meraa vishwaas kar, main inhen inke pita ke paas chhodkar turant lautne kii pratigya karti hum
 Hearing the deer's low voice, the hunter felt pity on him
 usne us mrigi ko bhi jane diya
 In the absence of hunting, the hunter sitting on the vine tree was being thrown down by breaking the bell-sheet
 pau fatne ko hui to ek hrisht-pusht mrug usee raste par aayaa
 The hunter thought that he would surely hunt it
 shikari kii tani pratyancha dekhakar mrigvinith swar main bolaa, he pardhi bhai! yadi tumne mujhase purv aane vaali teen mrigiyon tathaa chote-chote bacchon ko maar daalaa he, to mujhe bhi maarane main vilamb na karo, taaki mujhe unke viyog main ek kshan bhi dukh na sahanaa pade
 i am the husband of those deer
 yadi tumne unhen jeevandaan diya he to mujhe bhi kuch kshan kaa jivan dene kii krupa karo
 i will meet you and appear before you
 mrug kii baat sunate hi shikari ke saamne puri raat kaa ghatnachakra gum gaya, usne sari katha mrug ko suna di
 Then the deer said, 'the way my three wives have gone as promised, i will not be able to follow my religion with my death
 atah jaise tumne unhen vishwaasapaatr maanakar choda he, vaise hi mujhe bhi jane do
 i will appear before you soon with all of them
 ' upwas, raatri-jaagran tathaa shivlinga par belptr chadhane se shikari kaa hinsak hriday nirmal ho gaya tha
 Bhagavad Shakti was in him
 dhanush tathaa baan uske haath se sahaj hi chhot gaya
 Due to the compassion of Lord Shiva, his violent heart filled with compassionate feelings
 vah apane ateet ke karmon ko yaad karke pashchaatap kii jwaala main jalane laga
 Shortly afterwards, the antelope appeared before the family hunter, so that he could hunt them, but the hunter was very sorry for seeing such veracity, sattvikta and collective love of wild animals
 uske netron se aansuon kii jhadi lag gai
 By not killing that antelope family, the hunter removed his hard heart from living violence and made him soft and kind forever
 devloak se samast dev samaaj bhi is ghatana ko dekh rahe the
 As soon as the event ended, the Gods and Goddesses made flowers
 tab shikari tathaa mrug parivaar moksh ko praapt hue'

 anterrashtriya maatrak pranali, metry paddati kaa aadhunik rup he
 It is normally made in decimal and in coefficients of ten
 yah vigyaan evam vaanijya ke kshetra main vishwa kii sarvaadhik prayog kii jane vaali pranali he
 Groups of multiple units were used in the old metric system
 SI ko 1960 main puraani meter-kilogram-sacond yani pranali se viksit kiya gaya tha, bajaay centimetre-gram-sacond pranali kii, jisamen kai kathinaaiyaan thim
 The SI system does not remain stable, but it continues to evolve, but units are created and changed only through international agreements
 yah pranali lagbhag vishwavyapak str par lagu he or adhikansh desh iske alaava anya ikaayiyon kii aadhikarik paribhaashaayen bhi nahin samajhate hai
 But exceptions are the United States and Britain, where non-si units still have their old systems
 bharat mein yah pranali 1 april, 1957 mein lagu hui
 Along with this, new money was also introduced here, which was based on the decimal system itself
 is pranali main kai nai namakaran kii gai ikaiyaan lagu hui
 There are seven basic units in this system and many other derived units
 kuch vaigyanik or saanskrithik kshetron main es ai pranali ke saath anya ikaiyaan bhi prayog main laai jaati hai
 It is easy to express very small and very large quantities through SI prefixes
 kisi ikai kii paribhaasha or karyanvan ke bich antar mahatvapurn he
 The definition of each SI root unit has been carefully designed to be unique and unique, and at the same time presents a solid theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made
 ek ikai kii paribhaasha ke karyanvayan kii prakriya vah hoti he jisase ki vah paribhaasha us ikai kii bhaanti hi uski maatra ke maan or usase judi anischitata ko sthapit karne hetu; prayog kii ja sake
 How definitions of certain critical units are implemented is given on the BIPM website
 An SI derived unit unique form is defined only as SI root units

 However, any method that is compatible with the principles / laws of physics can be used to implement any SI units
 metric pranali ko vaigyanikon ke samooh dwaara abhikalpit kiya gaya tha
 Antony Loriate Lavacia was the chief among them, who is said to be the father of modern chemistry
 is samooh ko tarksangat maapan pranali kaa nirmaan karne hetu; france ke samraat lui XVI dwaara ekikrut evam adhikrut kiya gaya tha
 This system was adopted by the new government after the French Revolution

 Many different measurement systems were in use around the world until after World War II
 inamen se kai pranaliyaan, metric pranali kii hi bhinnak thi, jabaki anya yaa to imperium pranali yaa phir amareeki pranali par aadhaarit thim
 Then the need was proved that all these should be metered, so that a worldwide measurement system can be created

 Based on the results of this study, the Tenth CGPM decided in 1954 to derive an international system from six basic units that could provide measurements of mechanical and electromagnetic quantities as well as temperature and optical radiation
 anumodith kii gayi chah mul ikaiyaan thim meter, kilogram, sacond, ampear, degree calvin evam kandela
 In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units or the International System of Units, abbreviated as SI, originally from French: Le Système international d'unités
 The seventh parent unit, the mole or the mole, was added to the 14th CGPM in 1971

 The work is still in progress to integrate the two to form a joint standard ISO / IEC 8 xxrep 4 0 , which is called the International System of Quantities or International System of Quantities
 intaraashtriya ikai pranali main ikaayiyon kaa samooh he, jiske sadash hi upsargon ke samooh bhi hai
 SI units can be divided into two subgroups: - in ikaayiyon ke saath hi To create multiples of the root unit, the SI prefix can be added
 sabhi gunak das kii purna sankhya ghaat ke hai
 For example, kilo- = sahasra or thousand milli - = thousandth part i
e
 one meter has one hazards millimeters, plus one thousand meters to one kilometer
 upsargon ko milaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 a milligram is a millionth of a kilogram, but it will not be called a micro-kilogram

 Specific gravity is often represented in SI units, or in the context of water
 kyonki ek ghan jiske naap hai 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, uski aaytan hogi 1000 cm3, jo baraabar he 1 l ke; or jab jal se bharaa jaye, to uskaa bhaar 1 kg hota he, atev pani kii spacific gravity he 1 g / cm3 or yah 0 degree celsius par jam jaayegaa
 The metric system has received worldwide support as a means of means and daily commerce
 iskaa kaaran bahut had tak yah bhi tha ki kai deshon main rudhigat pranaaliyon main kai siddhanton ko samajhane kaa samarthy nahin thi
 At the same time, by standardizing regional changes, a world-wide system, which is universally accepted, was created
 isse anterrashtriya vyapaar ko bhi badhaava mila
 From a scientific point of view, the use of decimal can also be described as very large and very small units
 dainik evam vaigyanik prayog kii kai ikaiyaan, saat mul ikaayiyon se vyutpann nahin hai
 In many cases this change is BIPM
 Is also valid by Some examples include: The European Union has given a directive that prohibits the sale of non-si marked goods from 31 December 2009 onwards
 yah sabhi utpaadon, sanlagn nirdeshon or kaagajon, packing tathaa vigyapanon par lagu hota he
 But on 11 September 2007, the EU declared that the UK was exempted from this directive and that their imperial system would still be infinitely valid, along with the metric system
