 Royce Davids does not consider Buddhaghosha to be the author or compiler of the Jatakattavavana
 swayan jatakatthakatha ke upodghaat main lekhak ne apana parichay dete hue kaha he ‘‘ xxrep 4 
 shantchitt pandit buddhamitt bhikshu buddhadev ke kehane se xxrep 8 
 vyakhya karunga
 The Mahishasak sect was a Buddhist sect unlike the Mahavihara tradition
 buddhaghosh ne jitani atthakathaayen likhi he, shuddh mahaviharavasi bhikshuon kii upadesh vidhi par aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, it is not right to associate the author of the scripture with Acharya Buddhaghosh
 sambhavtah yah koi anya sinhalai bhikshu the, jinka kaal paanchavin shatabdi isvi mana ja saktaa he
 It contains the following stories: tripitak The Jataka tales relate to the past births of Lord Buddha

 So, they are all usually didactic

 Despite being didactic, he is artistic in its entire sense
 jataka ke aadi main nidaan-katha he, jisame bhagavan buddha ke pehle 24 budhon ke vivaran ke saath-saath bhagwaan gautam buddha kii jeevani letvan vihaar ke daan kii sweekruti tak di gai he

 Vanarind Jataka, Villarwat Jataka, Sihachamm Jataka, Sunsumar Jataka, and Sandhibdha Jataka etc
 jataka kathaayen pashu-kathaayen he
 These stories are very important
 visheshtah inhen kathaon kaa gaman videshon main hua he
 The cast of satire is also seen here in its poetic form
 praayah pashuon kii tulana main manushyon ko hin dikhaaya gaya he
 One special thing is that satire has been done on the entire caste and not on any person
 ek bandar kuch dinon ke liye manushyon ke bich aakar rahaa
 Later turns to his teammates
 saathi poochhate he-‘‘manushyon ke samaaj main rahe he
 They know their behavior
 hamen bhi kahen
 We want to hear that

 Say, we want to listen
 bandar ne kahana shuru kiya,‘‘ hiranya meraa! sona meraa! yahi raat din ve chillaate he
 Two people live in the house
 ek ko munch nahin hoti

 use bahut dhan se kharida jaataa he
 He hurts all the people
 ‘‘ bandar kah hi rahaa tha ki uske saathiyon ne kaan band kar liye‘‘ mat kahen mat kahen‘‘
 Many pictures of this kind of melodious and unique satire will be found in the native

 jataka keval lok-kathaon kaa pracheenatam sangrah bhar nahin hai
 Its place in Buddhist literature is well accepted
 sthaviravaad ke samaan mahayan main bhi uski prabhoot mahatta he, yadhyapi uske rup ke sambandh main kuch thodaa bahut parivartan he
 Like Buddhist literature, the Jataka has an important place in the overall Indian literature and not only that, in the whole world literature
 isi prakaar bhartiya sabhyataa ke ek yug kaa hi vah nidarshak nahin he, balki uske prasar kii ek adbhoot gaatha bhi jataka main samaaye hue hai

 People worshiped Yakshas, trees, serpents, Garuda and rivers
 ek stri ko jo apane pati se vichhud gai he, ham bhagirathi ganga kii stuti karte or uski sharan main jate dekhte hai
 But it is not right to conclude from this that one type of Bhagat Vat Dharma was prevalent among the people
 gokuldaas de ne is baat ko dikhaane kaa bada prayaas kiya he, ki dharm kaa jo swaroop jatakakaleen samaaj main ham dekhte hai usamen bhagwat dharm ke tatv vidyaman hai

 jataka vastutah pracheen bhartiya saamaajik jivan sambandhi soochnaaon kaa agaadh bhandar hi hai or unka samagratya adhyayan pali sahitya ke itihaas lekhak ke liye sambhav nahin he
 This is the subject of many great texts
 buddha dharm ke sabhi sampradaayon main jataka kaa mahatv supratishthit he
 It is a link connecting Mahayana and Hinayana, because the Bodhisattva ideal of Mahayana exists here in its seed-form
 duusari-teesri shatabdi isvi purv ke sanchi or bharhut ke stupon main jataka ke anek drishy ankit he

 Therefore, the importance of Jataka is not only in India, outside India also Stalism is not only important in Buddhism but also in many other forms of Buddhism
 kalkram kii drushti se vaidic sahitya kii shunagashep kii katha yama-yami samvaad, pururava urvashi samvaad aadi kathanak hi buddha purv kaal ke ho sakate he
 Some of the Upanishads, such as Chhandogya and Brihadaranyaka, may also be considered to be pre-buddha times, and similarly some narratives of Aitareya and Shatapatha Brahmana may also be considered to be pre-buddha

 The Tavija Sutta mentions the names of these ten mantra sages as well as Aitareya Brahmana, Taittiriya Brahmana, Chandogya Brahmana and Chhanda Brahmana, along with the names of Atakka, Vamak, Vamdev, Vishvamitra, Yamadagni, Andighara, Bharadwaja, Vasistha, Kashyapa and Bhrigu

 Similarly, in Setuketu Jataka there is mention of Uddālaka's son तुvetuketu to go to Taxila to study arts
 shatapath brahman ke uddalak ko ham uttarapath main bhraman karte hue dekhte he
 Therefore, it is not inconsistent to conclude from this that the Uddālakas of the Jātakas and ्वेvetuketu Brahmins are not different from the persons of these names in the texts and Upanishads
 german vidwaan luders ne sethuketu jataka main aane vaali gaathaon ko vaidic aakhyaan or mahakavy yugin kavy ko milaane vaali kadi kaha he, jo samuchit hi he

 ramayana or mahabharat ke saath jataka kii tulana karte samay hamen yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki in donon granthon ke sabhi ansh buddha purv yug ke nahin he
 There are 2400 verses in the present form of Ramayana
 ramayana main kaha bhi gaya he ‘chaturvinsh sahatrani shlokanam ukt van rishih
 But Buddhist scripture proves that even in the second century AD, there were only 12,000 verses in the Ramayana
 ramayana 2-109-34 main buddha tathagat kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Similarly, there is a description of conflict with Shaka, Yavan etc
 kiskindha kand main sugriv ke dwaara kuru madra or himalay ke bich main yawanon ou r shakon ke desh or nagaron ko sthit bataaya gaya he
 This proves that at the time when the passages were written, the Greeks and Scythians had established their suzerainty over some regions of Punjab

 There is a clear mention of educations in Maha Bharat

 shaanti parv main vishnugupt kautilya ke shishy kaamandak kaa bhi arthvidya ke acharya ke rup main ullekh he

 jataka kii anek gaathaon or ramayana ke shlokon main adbhut samanta he
 In Dasaratha Jataka and Devadhamma Jataka we often get the complete outline of rama-katha
 jayddis jataka main ram kaa dandakarany janaa dikhaaya gaya he
 Similarly, the resemblance of Sama Jataka is from Ramayana 2
 63-25 and in the opinion of Vinternitz the description of Jataka is more simple and preliminary
 vessantar jataka ke prakruti varnan kaa samya isi prakaar valmiki ke prakruti varnan se he or is jataka kii katha ke saath ram kii katha main bhi kaaphi sadrushta he
 Many scholars have compared Jataka with Mahabharata
 unke nishkarshon ko yahan sankshiptatam rup main bhi rakhana vastav main bada kathin he
 The Janak is the Janak Upanishads of the Jataka and the Brahminical Janak of Mahabharata
 mithila ke prasaadon ko jalte dekhakar janak ne kaha tha mithilaayaan pradiptayan na main dahyati kinchan
 Exactly the same statement is found in Mahajanaka Jataka and also in Kumbhakara Jataka and Sonak Jataka
 atah donon vyakti ek he
 Similarly, the entire story of Rishyashrighain is in Nakinika Jataka
 yudhisthir or vidura kaa samvaad das brahman jataka main he
 There is a story of Krishna and Draupadi in Kunal Jataka
 isi prakaar ghat jataka main krishna dwaara kansa-vadh or dwarka basaane kaa puraa varnan he
 The Mahakana Jataka Nimi Jataka and Mahanaradkasap Jataka describe King Ushinar and his son Shivi
 civi jataka main bhi raja shivi kii daan parmita kaa varnan he, apni aankhon ko de dene ke rup main
 So the story is basically Buddhist, no doubt
 mahabharat main 100 brahmadatton kaa ullekh he
 Probably Brahmadatta was the common adjective of kings, not the name of a single king, which was adopted by 100 kings
 dummedh jataka main bhi raja or uske kumaar donon kaa naam brahmadatt bataaya gaya he
 Similarly in Gangmal Jataka it is said that Brahmadatta is the name of the clan
 suseem jataka, kummaspind jataka, atthan jataka, lomaskassap jataka aadi jaatakon kii bhi, yahi sthiti he
 Therefore, Brahmadatta who came among the natives is not synonymous with only one time
 unamem kuch na kuch aitihaasikta bhi avashya he
 In addition to Ramayana and Mahabharata, Jataka stories are also mentioned in the great language of Patanjali
 pracheen jan sahitya main or baad ke katha-sahitya par bhi uskaa prabhaav uplakshith he

 The story of Bandar and Baya as Sikh na Dijai Banra, Baya Kau Ghar Jai is known in all the states of India
 bandar or baya kii yah kahani kutidusak jataka kii kahani he
 Similarly, many stories can be explored in an entertaining way
 jis prakaar jataka kathaayen samudr maarg se lanka, burma, siam, java, sumatra hind-china aadi dakshin purvi asia ke deshon ko gai or vahaan sthapaty kala aadi main chitrit kii gai usee prakaar sthal maarg se hindukush or himalay ko paar kar pashchimi deshon tak unke pahunchne kii katha badi lambi or manohar he

 There are many Jataka stories in Panchatantra, this fact is well known
 chhathin shatabdi isvin main panchatantra kaa anuwaad pahalavi bhashaa main kiya gaya
 It was translated into Arabic in the eighth century under the title Kalela Damna
 ‘ kalela damana’ shabd ‘karkat’ or ‘damanak’ ke arabi roopaantar hai
 In the fifteenth century the Arabic translation of the Panchatantra was translated into German, then gradually transformed into all European languages
 vastav main sidhe rup se bhi jataka ne videshi sahitya ko prabhavit kiya he or uski katha bhi atyant pracheen he
 The stories of Isop are famous in Greek literature
 french, german or angrej vidwaanon kii khoj se siddh he ki isap ek greek the
 The stories of Aesop have had a major influence on European literature, and it has been shown by scholars that the majority of Aesop's stories are based on the Jataka
 sihachamm jataka kii katha ati prasiddh he jo isap kii kahaniyon main bhi pai jaati he
 a donkey with a lion's skin is visible in both these places
 dow0 tii0 dablyoo0 rais davids kaa mat he ki shakespeare ne apane naatak king jonh main is katha kii ore sanket kiya he- ank-2, drishy-1 tathaa ank 3 drishy 1 main

 The stories of grateful animals and ungrateful human beings that are found in true character Jataka Takkariya Jataka and Mahakavi Jataka

 It consists of senior ministers and junior ministers, headed by the Prime Minister
 kendriya mantrimandal naamak ek choti kaaryakari nikaay, bharat main sarvocch nirnay lene kii sanstha hai
 Only the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Minister are members of the Cabinet

 yah suchi bharat ke kendriya mantriyon kii suchi he jise narendra modi ke netritv main solahavin loksabhaa ke gathan ke baad 2014 main chunaa gaya he
 This list has been changed in January 2015
 samuhik rup se mantriyon kii parishad bhartiya sansad ke nichle sadan ko javabdeh hai
 According to the Constitution of India, the total number of ministers in the Council of Ministers should not exceed 15% of the total number of members of the Lok Sabha
 har mantri ko sansad kaa sadsy hona aavashyak hai; jo mantri sansad ke nichle athwa upree sadan kaa lagaataar 6 maheenon tak sadsy nahin, usase turant uskaa mantri pad chin liya jayega
 There are three categories of ministers, which are in descending order of rank - jain sahitya bahut vishaal he
 It is mostly religious literature
 sanskrit, praakrit or apbhransh bhashaaon main yah sahitya likhaa gaya he
 Magadha has been the center of Mahavira's tendencies, so he gave his sermon here in Ardhamagadhi, the lingua franca which is safe among the available Jain proceeds
 ye aagam 45 hai or inhen shwetambar jain pramaan maanate hai, digambar jain nahin
 According to the Dingbar, the Agama literature has been estranged from time immemorial
 digambar shatkhandgam ko sweekaar karte hai jo 12wein angadrushtiwad kaa ansh mana gaya he
 The language of ancient literature of Digambars is Shaurseni
 aage chalakar apbhransh tathaa apbhransh kii uttarkalin lok-bhashaaon main jain panditon ne apni rachanaayen likhakar bhashaa sahitya ko samrudh banaaya
 In the ancient literature, the texts of Jain literature are found in most number and most authentically
 jain rachanakaaron ne puraana kavy, charit kavy, katha kavy, raas kavy aadi vividh prakaar ke granth rache
 Swayambhu, Pushp Dant, Hemachandra, Somprabha Suri etc
 are the main Jain poets
 inhone hinduon main prachlit lok kathaon ko bhi apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or parampara se alag uski parinti apane matanukool dikhaai
 The oldest part of Jain literature is called 'agam'
 ye aagam 46 hai- The Agam Granth is quite ancient, and the place which is of Vedas in Vedic literature and of Tripitaka in Buddhist literature, the same place is of Agamas in Jain literature
 aagam granthon main mahavir ke upadeshon tathaa jain samskruti se sambandh rakhane vaali anek katha-kahaniyon kaa sankalan he
 According to Jain tradition, after 160 years of Mahavira Nirvana, there was a great downturn in Magadha countries, due to which the Jain monks had to relocate elsewhere
 dushkaal samaapt ho jane par shraman patliputra main ekatrit hue or yahan khand-khand karke gyaarah angon kaa sankalan kiya gaya, barahawaan ang kisi ko samaran nahin tha, isliye uskaa sankalan na kiya ja sakaa
 This conference is known as 'pataliputra-vachana'
 kuch samay pashchaat jab aagam sahitya kaa phir viched hone laga to mahavir nirvana ke 827 yaa 840 varsh baad jain saadhuon ke duusare sammelan hue
 One in Mathura under the chairmanship of Aryaskandil and the other under the chairmanship of Nagarjuna Suri
 mathura ke sammelan ko 'maathuri-vaachana' kii sangya di gayi he
 Then after about 150 years, 980 or 993 years after Mahavira Nirvana, the fourth conference of sadhus was held in Vallabhi under the chairmanship of Devardhigini Apology, in which the proceeds were systematically compiled for the last time
 se 'valbhi-vaachana' ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 The present proceeds are the form of this concept
 jain aagmon kii ukt teen sankalanaaon ke itihaas se pataa lagata he ki samay-samay par aagam sahitya ko kaaphi kshati uthaani padi, or yah sahitya apane moulik rup main surakshit nahin rah sakaa
 This seems to be the reason that this literature is very less compared to the Buddhist literature, and it was probably due to the disorder in this literature that the Digambara sect refused to accept it
 isa ke purv lagbhag chauthi shatabdi se lagaakar isvi san paanchavi shatabdi tak kii bharatvarsh kii aarthik tathaa saamaajik dasha kaa chithran karne vaala yah sahitya anek drushtiyon se mahatva kaa he
 a detailed description of the ethos of Jain monks in texts like Ayarang, Suyagand, Uttarajhayana, Daswayaliya etc
, it corresponds very much to the Buddhist Dhammapada, Suttanipat and Mahabharata, etc
, and according to the statement of scholars like Dr
 Vintranese, that shramana
 - symbolizes poetry
 bhashaa or vishay aadi kii drushti se jain aagmon kaa yah bhaag sabase pracheen maaloom hota he
 In texts like Bhagwati Kalpasutra, Owaiah, Thanang, Nirayavali, Shramana gives a detailed description of Lord Mahavira, his Chariya, his teachings and the erstwhile king, prince and his war, which reveal many of the endangered practices of Jain history
 nayadhammakaha, uwasgadasa, antgavadasa, anuttarovaviyadasa, vivagasuy aadi granthon main mahavir dwaara kahi hui anek katha-kahaniyaan tathaa unki shishy-shishyaaon kaa varnan he, jisamen jain parampara sambandhi anek baton kaa parichay miltaa he
 Many important topics related to Vaastu Shastra, music, flora, etc
 are described in the texts like Raipanesya, Jeevabhigam, Pannavana, which is not available elsewhere
 chhedsutron main saadhuon ke aahaar-vihaar tathaa praayshchit aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisaki tulana baudhon ke vinayapitak se kii sakati he
 It is told in the Vrhatkalpasutra that when Mahavira Saket was a monk in a garden called Subhumibhaga, at that time he allowed his monks and nuns to visit the monastery in the east of Saket, up to Kaushambi of Daksai, and to Kunala in the north
 isse pataa lagata he ki armbh main jain dharm kaa prachaar simit tha, tathaa jain shraman magadh or uttar pradesh ke kuch hisson ko chhodkar anyatra nahin ja sakate the
 Of course, this part of the Holesutras is as ancient as Mahavira himself
 tatpashchaat raja kanishka ke samakaleen mathura ke jain shilalekhon main bhinn-bhinn gana, kul or shakhaon kaa ullekh he, vah bhadravahu ke kalpasutra main varnit gana, kul or shakhaon ke saath praayah mail khaataa he
 This also reveals the authenticity of Jain scriptures
 vastutah is samay tak jain parampara main shwetambar or digambar kaa bhed nahin maaloom hota
 The resemblance of Pali Tripitaka in the subject, language etc
 of Jain proceeds also reflects the antiquity of this literature
 pali-sutron kii attakathaon kii tarah aagmon kii bhi anek tikaa-tippaniyan, deepika, nivritti, vivaran, avchuri aadi likhi gayi hai
 This literature can be divided into four divisions, namely, Nirukti, Bhashya, Churni and Tika, combining Agam and it is called 'panchangi'
 aagam sahitya kii tarah yah sahitya bhi bahut mahatva kaa he
 In this, the subject of Agams is given in detail
 is sahitya main anek anushrutiyaan surakshit hai, jo aitihaasik drushti se atyant mahatvapurn hai
 There is a wide variety of archaeological material in the commentaries, such as large-scale, practical, practical, nihilakrini, essentials, essentials, Uttarayana tika, etc
, due to which India’s customs, fair festivals, monks, cults, times, floods, thieves, robbers, sartwahs, trade The routes, crafts, art, food, houses, jewelery, etc
, throw a lot of light on various subjects
 lok-katha or bhashaa shaastra kii drushti se bhi yah sahitya bahut mahatva kaa he

 Varadaraja, a disciple of Bhattojidixit, was also a great scholar of grammar
 unhone laghusiddhantakoumudi kii rachana kii
 In the ancient practice of the study of Paninian grammar, the order of Paninian formulas was considered to be the basis
 yah kram prayogsiddhi kii drushti se kathin tha kyonki ek hi prayog kaa saadhan karne ke liye vibhinn adhyyon ke sutara lagane padate the
 Seeing this difficulty required the invention of such a method wherein all the formulas required for the accomplishment of experiments were available in one place
 siddhantakoumudi, ashtaadhi se adhik lokapriy he
 The permutations of Ashtadhyayi's formulas have been collected and interpreted under appropriate headings

 Siddhantakomudi is a very large book, grammar of Sanskrit language has come fully in it
 isamen kai prakaran hai, jaise- All the symbols have been explained, such as- siddhantakoumudi bhattozidikshit kii kirti kaa prasar karne vaala mukhya granth he
 It was written after the word 'kaustubh'
 bhattozidikshit ne swayan hi is par praudhmanorama naam kii tikaa likhi he
 siddhanta-kaumudi is considered the best text of the method
 isse purv jo prakriya ganth likhe gayi the unamem ashtaadhi ke sabhi sutron kaa samavesh nahin tha
 In Siddhantakomudi, Bhattojidixit has arranged all the sutras of Ashtadhyayi in various cases, giving details of the forms of all the metals under it and analyzing the grammar of cosmic Sanskrit and keeping Vedic process and vocal process at an end
 bhattozidikshit ne kashika, nyaas evam padam jari aadi sutrakramanusaarini vyakhyaaon tathaa prakriyakoumudi or uski tikaaon ke maton kii samiksha karte hue prakriya-paddati ke anusaar panineey vyakaran kaa sarvangin rup prastut karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 He has also mentioned definitions, talks and commentaries as required
 unhone munitray ke mantavyon kaa saamanjasy dikhaaya he tathaa mahabhashya kaa aadhaar lekar kuch swakeey mat bhi sthapit kiye hai
 Also, the saintliness of any controversial experiments used by famous poets is also considered
 madhyayug main siddhantakoumudi kaa itnaa prachaar evam prasar hua ki panini vyakaran kii pracheen paddati evam mugdhbodh aadi vyakaran paddatiyaan villin hoti chali gai
 In due course of time, the scholars also looked towards the defects of the method and theory but they could not leave it
 panineey vyakaran main bhattazidikshit kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 He has such a unique influence on Panini-grammar that the importance of the great language has also been forgotten

 a direct line motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy
 disi motor main bahut se aapas main sambhddha chaalkon kaa tantra rahata he, jo ek armechar par aropit hota he
 The armature is made by joining several plates of malleable iron and is cylindrical
 isamen chaaron ore khaanche kate hue hote hai, jinamein chaalak samoohon ko kundali athwa dandon ke rup main rakhaa jaataa he
 These drivers, according to a certain scheme, are interconnected

 Different types of coils have specific characteristics, which have specific characteristics of specific types of coils, with distinct advantages
 chumbakeey kshetra bhi ek duusare chaalak samooh main se dhara ko pravaahit kar praapt kiya jaataa he
 Direct currents in armature drivers of motors are carried by Burroughs

 Are associated with the coils generating magnetic fields
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karanevaale kundalanon ko saamanyat: kshetra kundali kehete hai
 These coils may be associated with the armature coil in series or associated in parallel or in parallel
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki unke kuch kundalan shrenee main hon or kuch samaantar main
 Based on this combination of field coils, three different types of direct current motors are obtained - shrenee motor main jo dhara armechar main se hokar pravaahit hoti he, vahi kshetra kundali main bhi pravaahit hoti he
 Hence, there is very little coil of coarse wire in its field coil
 shant motor main purna dhara kaa kuch ansh hi kshetra kundali main hokar bahata he, jo uske aarpaar boltata tathaa kundalan ke pratirodh par nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, in this region the coil has very high coil of very thin wire, due to which the resistance of this coil is usually several hundred ohms

 homeopathy, ek chikitsa paddati he
 Dr
 Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann is the father of homeopathy medical science
 yah chikitsa ke 'samarupata ke sinddhaat' par aadhaarit he jiske anusaar aushadhiyaan un rogon se milte julate rog dur kar sakati hai, jinhen ve utpann kar sakati hai
 The curative power of the drug depends on the symptoms that may arise
 jinhen rog ke lakshanon ke samaan kintu unase prabal hona chahie
 Therefore, the disease can be determined and destroyed with the help of the same medicine, which can produce all the symptoms in the human body, strong with the symptoms and very similar to the symptoms
 homeopathy paddati main chikitsak kaa mukhya kaary rogi dwaara bataae gaye jivan-itihaas evam rogalakshanon ko sunakar usee prakaar ke lakshanon ko utpann karanevaali aushadhi kaa chunaav karnaa he
 The greater the similarity between disease symptoms and drug symptoms, the greater the chances of a patient becoming healthy
 chikitsak kaa anubhav uskaa sabase bada sahaayak hota he
 Treatment of chronic and difficult diseases requires patience for both the patient and the physician
 kuch homeopathy chikitsa paddati ke samarthakon kaa mat he ki rog kaa kaaran sharir main shoravish kii vruddhi he
 Homeopathy practitioners believe that every living being we have a tendency to maintain the functional ideal of the senses and when this functional ideal is distorted, then the creature has many reactions to achieve this ideal
 praani ko aushadhi dwaara keval uske prayaas main sahaayta milti he
 The medicine should be given in small amounts, because in the disease, the patient is hyper-sensitive
 aushadhi kii alp maatra prabhavakaari hoti he jisase keval ek hi prabhaav prakat hota he or koi dushaprinaam nahin hote
 This monotonic effect is regulated in the restoration of health due to the modulated aggregation of tissues in the morbid state
 vidwaan homeopathy ko chhadam vigyaan maanate hai
 The basic principle of homeopathy promoted by Dr
 Hahnemann is - "similia simivibus curator" means diseases that are safely, quickly and very effectively cured by drugs that are capable of producing symptoms similar to the patient's symptoms
 duusare shabdon main, is niyam ke anusaar jis aushadhi kii adhik maatra swasth sharir main jo vikaar paidaa karti he usee aushadhi kii laghu maatra vaise samalakshan vaale prakritik lakshanein ko nasht bhi karti he
 For example, the symptoms of colds on cutting raw onions such as water coming out of the nose and eyes, in the same type of cold, giving homeopathic medicine alium cepa can also be cured
 homeopathy main rogiyon ko ek samay main ek hi aushadhi ko dene kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 On the basis of experience, Hahnemann decided to legislate only one drug at a time, but now this opinion has changed enough
