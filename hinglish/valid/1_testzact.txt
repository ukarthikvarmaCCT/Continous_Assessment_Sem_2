 There is a dividing board between the right and left side cells, which does not allow the blood on both sides to meet
 prayek ore ek koshth upar he, jo alind kehalaata he or neeche kaa koshth nilay kaha jaataa he
 In the right ventricle, there are two holes in the upper half of the apex, through which blood returns to the heart
 ek bada chhidr alind or nilay ke bich main hai, jisapar kapatika lagi hui he
 At the time of contraction of the heart, the atrophy of the atrium opens towards the ventricle, causing the blood to enter the ventricle
 daahine nilay main phupfusi dhamni kaa bhi chhidr he
 On narrowing of the ventricle, the blood passes into the pleura, which occurs in the pulmonary artery
 isi prakaar bai ore bhi upar alind he or neeche nilay
 In the left ventricle there are four pus venous holes, by which the purified blood in the pleura comes back and when the atrium is secreted, it goes into the ventricle by the hole between the ventricle and the atrium
 bai ore ke is chhidr par bhi kapatika lagi hui he
 There is a perforation of the aorta in the left ventricle, from which the blood flows out into the aorta and by its multiple branches communicates throughout the body, returning by the veins and then back to the right atrium of the heart
 ye bade mahatv kii sanrachanaayen hai, jo rudhir ko keval ek maarg se agrasar hone detii hai, lautne nahin deteen
 The right side capillary is made up of three caudal parts and is called the trivalon capillary

 On the side of the ventricle, there are fine fibers similar to those of the rope, the other end of which are on the shoots coming out of the ventricular wall
 ye condaryrajju kehalaate hai or ankuron ko peplia peshi kaha jaataa he
 When the atrium is filled with blood in the ventricle due to the atrial fibrillation, when it narrows, the blood reaches behind the cords and raises them towards the holes, so that their ends meet together to stop the passage of the hole and the blood does not return to the atrium
 Finds
 peplia peshi bhi sankuchit ho jaati hai, jisase condaryrajju tan jaati he or kapaticaon ke kapard alind main ulatney nahin pate
 With this type of management, the blood can move in only one direction, from the atrium to the ventricle

 vahaan oxigen lekar, rudhir chaar phupfusi shiraaon dwaara baayein alind main jaataa he or uske sankuchan karne par rudhir baayein nilay main chalaa jaataa he
 When narrowing in the left ventricle, the blood advances into the aorta
 is dhamni kii shakhaayen, jinka neeche ullekh kiya gaya he, sharir main faili hui hai
 Blood circulates through them in the capillaries and through the capillaries, veins then return to the right part of the heart and then the same cycle begins
 yahi rudhir parisancharan kehalaata he
 The heart itself has the power to contract
 vah prati minute 72 baar sankuchan karata he, arthath ek baar sankuchan main 0

 During this period, the atrial contraction takes place for 0
1 second, the remaining 0

 This is called branching
 hriday se nikalanevaali do mukhya dhamni hai, phuffusi or mahadhamani
 After the pulmonary artery exits the right ventricle, it divides into two branches and one branch goes into each pleural
 is dhamni kaa prayojan oxigen lene ke liye rudhir ko phuffus main pahunchaana he
 After going out of the left ventricle of the heart, go first to the right, then backwards, then to the left, where the fourth thorax reaches the left side of the vertebra and goes straight down to the end of the thoracic descending
 is prakaar prarambh main iskaa jo mode banataa he, vah mahadhamani chaap kehalaata he
 At the end of the thorax, by passing through the ventral muscle, reaching the fourth lumbar vertebrae, crossing the entire abdomen, the two common series pane terminates by dividing the arteries
 vaksh main hridhamaniyaan mahadhamani kii pratham shakhaayen hai, jo hriday se mahadhamani ke nikalne ke sthaan hi par donon ore se nikalakar hriday par ek gheraa sa bana detaa hai
 Their branches go straight down and provide nutrition to the heart muscle
 mahadhamani chaap ke anuprastha bhaag main, dahini ore se kramash: anami, baani mulgriva dhamni or bai adhojatruk shakhaayen nikalati hai
 Anami is the largest branch and reaches right into the cervical mucus, transmits blood in the right root cervix and head and heals the subcutaneous vertical branch
 mulgriva sidhi greeva main upar jaakar avatu upasthi kii urdhv dhara par bahya or ant:greeva shakhaon main vibhakt ho jaati hai
 After giving a branch to the cervical eyeball, it penetrates the cranium through the cranium, dividing into the forebrain and middle cerebral branches, which give blood to the front and middle parts of the brain
 donon ore kii ant: greevaayen pramastishk ke tal par pahunchakar aage kii ore swayan ek sanyojani shakha dwaara aapas main or peeche kii ore bhi duusari shakha dwaara aadhaar dhamni se sammelan karti hai
 Thus a circle is formed there, which is called the ring of the villum

 ek yaa do inch aage chalakar ant:prakoshthik shirayen aadhaar shira main or bahi:prakoshthik sheersh shiraaon main jute jaati hai
 The base and apex veins move upward on the inner and outer sides of the arm, and after joining the veins of the external artery, the veins open into the orbital vein which itself becomes the posterior end and the subclavian to join the intercostal
 Anami then makes vein
 paanv ke prishth par kii shira jalikaon main bheetar kii ore ant:sakthi or baahar kii ore bahi:sakthi shirayen aarambh hoti hai, jo ant: or bahi: gulf ke neeche se nikalakar jangha ke bheetar kii ore tathaa bich main hoti hui upar ko chali jaati hai

 Veins have a similar structure to the wall, but their thickness is much less than that of the arteries
 mansapeshi utak visheshtya kam hota he or jahaan tahaan antarkala str kii vruddhi se kapatikaay ban jaati hai
 There are usually two cupards in the capillaries, although somewhere three and one are also found, the cupards are similar to the sac, which is located in the path of the vein in such a way that if the blood starts returning, these bags are filled
 That is, they swell and close the path
 vahikaatantr kaa ek mahatvapurn avyav keshikas kehalaata he
 a group of capillaries is located between the arteries and veins

 In this way, the capillary group is similar to a lake, in which a river enters from one side and another river from the other side
 keshikas atyant sookshm vahikaaye hoti hai, jinaki bhitiyaan ant main keval ek koshika moti rah jaati hai
 When the blood flows through the arteries into these capillaries, the nutrients and oxygen present in the blood diffuse from it into the tissues of the organ, and the resultant chemical or chemical reactions in the organ, which form inferior or final substances, are blood
 i come yaheen se shira kaa prarambh ho jaataa he
 First it flows into the blood capillaries

 Also the radio frequency is the second main cause of the coater impedance

 For the longitudinal case, one has z | | = r s 1 − i q 1 + q 2 2 { \ displaystyle z_{||}=r_{s}{ \ frac {1-iq}{1+q^{2} \ left^{2 xxrep 4 } with r s { \ displaystyle R_ {s}} the shunt impedance, q { \ displaystyle Q}, the quality factor, and ω r { \ displaystyle \ omega _ {r}} the resonant frequency
 Given a circular beam piper of radius b { \ displaystyle b}, and conductivity σ { \ displaystyle \ sigma }, the impedance is given by z = 1 - icb ω 2 π σ { \ displaystyle z = { \ frac {1-i} {cb}} { \ sqrt { \ frac { \ omega} {2 \ pi \ sigma xxrep 4 } The corresponding longitudinal wakefield is approximately given by w = q 2 π bc σ 1 s 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle w = { \ frac {q} {2 \ pi b}} { \ sqrt { \ frac {c} { \ sigma}}} { \ frac {1 } {s ^ {3 / 2 xxrep 4 } The transverse wake-function from the resistive wall is given by w ≈ 1 s 1 / 2 { \ displaystyle w \ approx { \ frac {1} {s ^ {1 / 2 xxrep 4 } The impedance acts back on the beam and can cause a variety of effects, often considered deleterious for accelerator functioning
 In general, impedance effects are classified under the category of "collective effects" due to the fact that the whole beam must be considered together, and not just a single particle
 The whole beam may, however, cause particular changes in the dynamics of individual particles such as tune shifts and coupling
 Whole beam changes include emittance growth and instabilities that can lead to beam loss

 neeche dikhaaya gaya he ke alag shreniyon ke taron kaa kya taapmaana hota he or hamaare suraj kii tulana main kya aakaar or chamkilaapan hota he
 Note that this is only valid for the strings of the main sequence - 1880 i ke baad ke kaal main harvard vishvavidhyalay kii vedhashala main kaam kar rahe vaigyanikon ne sitaron kii 'A' se lekar 'O' tak shreniyan banaai
 But in the 1920s the Indian astronomer Meghnad Saha showed a relationship between the spectrum of stars and their surface temperature
 jaise-jaise is kshetra main gyaan badhata gaya, vaigyanikon ne shreniyan taapmaana ke anusaar badal di or jahaan do shreniyan vastav main ek hi taapmaana ke taron ke bare main thi unhen vilay karke ek shrenee hataa di gayi 
 The study of Saha and other scientists made it clear that OBAFGKM are actually surface temperature ranges
 1943 main yarkis vedhashala main kaam kar rahe teen vaigyanikon ne taron ke varnakram kii ek nayi shreneekaran vidhi banaai
 The names of these scientists were William Wilson Morgan, Philippe C
 Keenan and Edith Calman, so the system is also called the "MKK" method, which is formed by adding the first English letters to their last names
 jahaan harvard shreneekaran sirf satahi taapmaana ke hisaab se chalata he or keval boune taron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he vahaan yarkis shreneekaran main satahi taapmaana or chamak donon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or yah sabhi taron kaa shreneekaran karte hai
 Monster stars have the same mass as dwarf stars, but their diameter is greater than dwarf stars
 isliye daanav taron kii sataha par gurutvkarshan, gas kaa ghanatv or dabaav teenon boune taron se bahut kam hote hai
 This difference can be seen to have a significant impact on the spectrum
 boune taron ke zyaada dabaav kii vajah se unke varnakram kii laqiren "fail" jaati hai
 According to the gloss, the yurkese method has these categories - chin, bharat kii ek pramukh janajati hai
 The Darrah National Park or the National Chambal Wildlife Sanctuary is 50 km from Kota in the Indian state of Rajasthan, which is very popular for crocodiles

 Creativism is the third approach to the study of international relations
 adarshavaad or yatharthwaad ke mukaable yah nazariyaa vishwa-raajnneeti kii jaanch saamaajik dharaatal par karne kii tajaviz karata he
 Creativists claim that a correct understanding of international relations cannot be achieved only by rational interactions occurring within the confines of physical boundaries, nor can it be taken to test them within institutional boundaries
 rachanaatmakataavaadiyon ke anusaar samprabhu rajyon ke bich banane vaale sambandh keval unke sthir rashtriya hiton par hi aadhaarit nahin hote
 They have to understand the steps to be taken under the influence of identities created during the long term by looking at them as formats
 rachanaatmakataavaadi apana dhyaan antarrashtriya samudaay ke str par maujuud sansthaaon par kendrit karte hue antarrashtriya kanoon, rajnay or samprabhutaa ko ahmiyat dete hai
 Governments are also important to them, as they also create regulatory and bill structures
 unke haathon ek saamaajik jagat rachaa jaataa he jisaki madad se rajya ke vyavhaar or aacharan taatparyon kaa andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The theory of constructivism does not ignore the physical dimensions, but it adds social dimensions to understand the international order along with them
 iske tahat jab sansthaaon kii charchaa kii jaati he to uskaa matlab keval santhnik dhaanchaa hi nahin hota
 Institution implies a stable structure of identities and interests
 ek aisi sanrachana jisamen sajhi samaj, sajhi apekshaayen or saamaajik gyaan antarnihit he
 Creativist institutions are basically seen as a cognitive existence that has to remain within the confines of the limits of the ideas of its actors
 sansthagat sanrachanaon ke maanakeey prabhaav ke saath- saath rachanaatmakatavaad badalte hue maanakon or asmitaaon va hiton ke bich bane sutron kii jaanch karata he
 Since the activities of the state and other actors are constantly changing in institutions, constructivism sees institutions and actors as mutually adapting existence
 is vivaran se lag saktaa he ki ek saidhantik ravaiye ke taur par rachanaatmakatavaad par amal karnaa kuch mushkil hi hoga
 In fact, instead of recommending the selection of a particular social structure to assess the behavior of states, this approach states that the structure of a state can be examined and the state behavior can be estimated within its specific scope
 is
 agar anumaan galat sabit hota he to iskaa matlab yah hua ki us sanrachana ko thik se samajha nahin gaya he yaa vah achaanak badal gayi he
 For example, if realists say that there is anarchy in international relations, then constructivists will say that this notion stems from their view of the international community in the mirror of the 'natural state' propounded by Hobbes
 is prakrut avasthaa kaa nishkarsh saamaajik sambandhon kii ek vishisht sanrachana se nikaala gaya he jo ab badal chuki he
 According to the structuralist beliefs, international institutions also regulate and play a role in legislation
 vinimankaaree bhoomika kaa arth he kuch khaas tarah ke vyavhaaron or aacharnon ko maanya yaa pratibandhit karnaa
 The Bill role means defining a behavior or behavior and accomplishing it in a certain sense
 rajya unki nigaah main ek nagomik asmita he
 He sets his basic goals
 par in lakshyon kii prapti saamaajik asmitaaon par nirbhar he; arthath rajya khud ko antarrashtriya samaaj ke sandarbh main jis tarah samajhegaa, usee tarah uski saamaajik asmitaayen banengi
 The national interest of the state will be structured on the basis of similar identities
 sanrachnawadi yathartwaadiyon dwaara araajaktaa ko diye jane vaale mahatva ko puri tarah nazarandaaz nahin karte, par unka kahana he ki araajaktaa apane aap main ahm nahin ho sakati
 The chaos of relations can also occur between two friendly states and between two enemy states
 donon kaa matlab alag-alag hoga
 In this sense, it is not anarchy, but only the varieties of social relations that can be formed under its influence
 in kism-kism ke saamaajik sambandhon ke mutabik hi rajya apane hiton ko paribhaashit karte hai
 For example, the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War was also a social relationship in which they both viewed each other as enemies and accordingly structured their national interests
 jab unhone ek-duusare ko us saamaajik sambandh ke aaine main dekhnaa band kar diya, yaa us tarah ke saamaajik sambandh kii paristhitiyaan hi nahin rah gayin to uske parinamswaroop sheet-yuddh khatm ho gaya
 It is clear that constructivism has not been able to explain its usefulness as an explanatory theory
 iske baavjood use ek saidhantik dhaanchaa pesh karne main kamyaabi avashya mili he
 The inadequacies of realist and idealistic approaches also have a role behind the prevalence of constructivism

 Ranges from 5 to 4 tons per hectare
 iske vipareet, frans jaise deshon main genhu kii paidaavaar 8 ton prati hectare se adhik he
 These variations in yields are mainly due to variations in the level of climate, genetics and intensive farming techniques

 Many issues related to GMO practices have arisen regarding food safety and environmental impacts
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch paryaavaran vigyaani or arthshaastri GMO prathaon jaise termineter beej ke sambandh main gmos par prashn uthaate hai
 Which is a genetic modification that produces infertile seeds
 vartmaan main antarrashtriya str par termineter beej kaa bahut adhik virodh kiya ja rahaa he or is par vishwa stareey roak lagaaye jane ke liye nirantar prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Another controversial issue is patent protection for companies that grow new types of seeds using genetic engineering
 chunki companiyon ke paas apane beej kaa bauddhik swaamitv he, unke paas apane patent utpaada kii sharten or niyam lagu karne kaa adhikaar he
 Currently, ten seed companies control more than two-thirds of the world's seed sales
 vandana shiv kaa tark he ki ye companiyaan laabh ke liye jeev kaa shoshan karne or jivan ke patent ke dwaara jaev piresi ke doshi hai
 Farmers using patent seeds cannot save the seed for the next crop, forcing them to buy new seeds every year
 chunki viksit or vikaas sheel donon prakaar ke deshon main beej ko bachaana kai kisaanon ke liye ek paaramparik pratha he, GMO beej kisaanon ko beej bachaane kii is pratha ko parivartit karne or har saal nae beej kharidne ke liye baadhya karte hai
 Locally adapted seeds are also capable, just like present hybrid seeds and gmos
 sthaneey rup se anukulit beej, jo bhoomi prajati yaa fasal paristhitik-prakaar bhi kehalaate hai, ve mahatvapurn hai kyonki samay ke saath ve jutai ke kshetra ke vishesh sookshm vaataavaran, mrudaa, anya paryaavarni paristhitiyon, kshetra ke dizin or jaateey variyata ke liye anukulit ho jate hai
 Bringing gmos and hybridized commercial seeds into an area also poses a risk of pollination with local species, therefore, gmos are a threat to land species and traditional ethnic heritage
 ek baar beej main jab transgenic saamagree shaamil ho jaati he, yah us beej company ke ko sharton ke adheen bana detaa he, jiske paas transgenic saamagree kaa patent he
 There is also the issue that gmos cross-pollinate with wild species and permanently alter the heredity of native populations; Several wild plants have been identified in which transgenic genes have been found
 GMO jin kaa sambandhit khar-patavaar prajati main chalaa janaa bhi ek chintaa kaa vishay he, aisa bhi gaiyr transgenic fasal ke saath par paragan ke dwaara hi hota he
 Since many GMO crops are harvested for their seeds, such as rapeseed, there is a problem of seed spillage during volunteer transport for volunteer plants in transportation and on recurring fields
 khaadya raksha ke mudde bhi sanyogvash khaadya suraksha or khaadya labling ke muddon se mail khate hai
 Currently a world treaty, the Bio Safety Protocol, regulates the trade of gmos
 vartmaan main EU ke liye sabhi GMO khaadya padaarthon ko label karnaa jaruri he, jabaki US main GMO khaadya padaarthon kii paardarshak labling jaruri nahin he
 So there are many questions on the risks and safety issues related to GMO foods, some people believe that the public should have the right to choose foods for themselves, must know what she is eating and for all GMO products Must be labeled
 krishi, kitnashkon, poshakon ke risaav, atirikt jal upyog or anya mishrit samasyaon ke dwaara samaaj par kai bahari kharche adhyaropit karti he An assessment on agriculture in Britain in 2000 showed that the total external cost for 1996 was 2343 million British pounds, or 208 pounds per hectare
 sanyukt rajya main 2005 ke ek vishleshan main nishkarsh nikaala gaya ki fasal bhoomi lagbhag 5-16 billian dollar adhyaropit karti he, jabaki pashudhan utpaadan 714 million dollar adhyaropit karata he
 Both studies conclude that more work should be done to reduce external costs, this analysis did not include their subsidies, but noted that subsidies also impact society in terms of the cost of agriculture

 The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture defines a food mile as follows: "

 Locavores argue that lettuce, originally grown in California, shipped to New York by ships, is still a temporary food source because it relies on fossil fuels for its transfer
 "lokavorce" aandolan ke alaava, tel aadhaarit krishi par nirbharta ke mudde ne ghar or saamudayik bagwani kii or rujhaan ko badhaaya he
 Link kisaanon nen makke jaisi fasalon ko isliye bhi ugaana shuru kar diya he taaki unka istemaal bhojan kii bajaay peak tel kii kami ko pura karne main kiya ja sake

 Some of these shortcomings resulted in food riots and a stampede
 krishi kshetra main ek anya pramukh petroleum mudda he petroleum aapurti kaa prabhaav urvarak utpaadan par padegaa
 The highest input of fossil fuels in agriculture is the use of natural gas as a hydrogen source for the haber-bosch fertilizer manufacturing process, natural gas is used because it is the cheapest source of hydrogen currently available
 jab tel kaa utpaadan bahut kam ho jaataa he tab praakrit gas ko iske vikalp ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 And as the use of hydrogen increases in transportation, natural gas will become more expensive
 yadi habar prakriya ko navyakaraniya urja kaa upyog karte hue vanijikrut nahin kiya ja saktaa yaa yadi habar prakriya ko pratisthapit karne ke liye hydrogen ke anya strot itani maatra main uplabdh nahin hai, ki ve parivahan or krishi kii aavashyaktaa ke liye paryaapt hon, to urvarak kaa yah mukhya strot yaa to bahut adhik mahangaa ho jaayegaa yaa uplabdh nahin hoga
 This will either bring down food shortages or dramatically increase food prices

 However, organic farming can be more labor intensive and there may be pressure on the work area to shift from urban to rural areas

 When the symphonyl is used on site, the process will become more effective and this will provide enough fuel for organic-agricultural mobilization

 Before ancient anthropological discoveries were made in America, there was also the possibility that the ancestors of Indians had developed as an independent branch of mankind on this land, but now it can be said with certainty that mankind on the American continents In the development of a branch of the Kumbh, only the preserved remains of lemurs, tarsiers and monkeys of certain castes have been found on this territory

 Stone tools, rubbish, bone and horn tools made by pressure or wear, the use of fire, the art of making traps and crates, bow and spear throwing instruments and domesticated dogs are probably the main elements of the original culture of Indians
 Can go asia se america aakar indianon ke purvaj apni mul asian shakha se ekadam alag ho gaye athwa unhone usase kisi prakaar kaa sambandh banaae rakhaa, is vishay par vidwaanon main matbhed he
 On the basis of the physical difficulties in maintaining such relations, it can be easily inferred that even if there was a relationship among these terrains, it would have been very limited in its extent and influence
 kalantar main saanskrithik vikaas kii jo dishaaen in samoohon ne apanaai ve bahm samskritiyon se prabhavit nahin hui
 These groups developed the new-age culture independently

 The Essence of Buddhism
 Hindi means the essence of Buddhism
 yah ek aisa granth he jo un nibandhon kaa jo dakshin bharat kii kuch patrikaon ke liye buddha vishyon par likhe gaye the, antim rup he
 The aim is to make available a collection of the main beliefs regarding Buddhism at one place, a collection in which those main beliefs have been evaluated from the point of view of modern knowledge
 yahan moulikta kaa daawa nahin kiya gaya he
 Most of the material available in it is available in the books of well-known archaeologists
 pali or sanskrit ke granthon se liye gaye uddharanon se yukt hone ke baavjood yahan yah daawa nahin kiya gaya he ki yah kriti pali or sanskrit paanditya kaa pratifal he
 This is nothing more than a humble tribute to a disciple engaged in the service of his master
 apane swami kii shikshaaon ko logon ke saamne upasthit karte samay shishy ke liye yah anivaary he ki vah un manyataon ko aankh se ojhal na hone de, jo un shikshaaon kaa muladhar he
 As far as Lord Buddha is concerned, truth is his right and his disciple should follow the truth
 isliye buddha dharm kii jitani bhi shakhaayen hai ve sabhi is siddhanth ko maanya tehraati hai ki bhagwaan buddha kii deshna ke liye tark sangat hona yaa satyanuai hona anivaary he
 The author of the book, while rendering Buddhism against the backdrop of modern knowledge, has never compromised with his Buddhist position but merely imitated the ideal which was revered among Buddhists from the earliest times
 yadi vah buddha dharm ko kisi had tak aadhuniktaa kaa jama pehanaane main safal ho gaya to usne aadhunik vichaaron ko thode se buddha dharm se chupad kar aisa nahin kiya he balki buddha dharm kii sabhi manyataon kii gaharaai main jaakar vahon jo satya chipa rahaa he, use ujagar karke hi aisa kiya he
 Thoughtful people from Europe and America have been attracted to Buddhism
 At this time such institutions have been organized there, whose purpose is to propagate Buddhism
 mahabodhi socity kii ek shakha jiskaa pradhan karyaalay chicago main he, america main mahatvapurn kaam kar rahi he
 There is a Japanese Buddhist mission in San Francisco that is publishing a magazine called Dharma Jyoti, it is said that this magazine is very popular in America
 lipjing main ek buddha sanstha he jo der buddhist naam se ek patrika prakashit karne ke alaava vyakhyanon tathaa saste sahitya ke madhyam se bhi buddha dharm kaa prachaar kar rahi he
 Except for some mythical nationalist beliefs, there is no doubt that Buddhism will attract Westerners as well
 yah bhi satya he kii aisa bhi kaha jaataa he kii buddha dharm itnaa adhik pavitra he kii yah un logon ko aakarshith nahin kar saktaa jo shaadi vivaah karne ko oonche vichaar ke jivan kaa baadhak nahin maanate
 From this point of view, there is nothing to worry about Buddhism even when evaluating Buddhism
 aarambhik kaal se hi buddha dharm ke aise sampradaay chale aa rahe hai jinaki sthapana he ki grahastha bhi arhatv kaa laabh kar saktaa he ek aisa dharm jo itnaa lacheela he kii vah ek ore to nepal ke vajraachaaryon kaa apane main samavesh kar saktaa he or duusari ore srilanka ke sthaviron kaa, usamen itani gunjaish avashya he ki usamen ek ore tapasvi jivan or ek ore grahastha jivan ke manjon kaa donon kaa samavesh ho sake
 a famous etihavetta has accepted the re-establishment of Buddhism in India
 shiksha tathaa swatantra chintan ke vistaar ke saath yah sambhav nahin ki buddha dharm un chintan sheel bharatiyon ko aakarshith kar sake jinhen ab na ram se or na rahim se kuch bhi lenaa dena rahaa he, na krishna or christ se, na kaali yaa lakshmi se na maari yaa mairi se
 There is also no dearth of signs that reveal that people are taking a permanent interest in the teachings of that Lord Buddha
 jinke bare main ek samay aisi manyata thi ki unka janmbharat main isliye hua tha ki vah duniya bhar ke logon ke paapon kaa bhar apane sir odh saken jaise-jaise swadeshi bhaavana kii jaden majboot hongi vaaie-vaise shakya muni kaa naam jo is samay aprakat he, nishchayatmak rup se apni chamak-dhamak or puri shaan ke saath ubharne vaala he
 It has been rightly said that the civilized world is based on its moral beliefs, not its spiritual beliefs
 jo shakti sabhy samaaj kaa muladhar he or sanbhale hue he vah na to aatma-paramatma sambandhi vishwaas he, na teen main ek vishwaas, na ishwar kii sarvavyaapaktaa or sarvajyata kaa vishwaas, balki sachai, daan sheeltaa, nyaaypriyata, shansheeltaa, bhraatrubhaav, thode main vah sab kuch jo dharm shabd ke antargat samavisht he
 Emperor Ashoka did precisely this by making Buddhism the foundation of his rule
 jab tak is dharm ko sabhi rashtron dwaara sweekaara nahin jaataa ham na sansar main shanti kii aashaa kar sakate hai or na sansar kii suraksha kii

 dandi sanskrit bhashaa ke prasiddh sahityakar hai
 There is a lack of authentic information regarding his life
 kuch vidwaan inhen saatvin shatee ke uttarardh yaa aathvin shatee ke prarambh kaa maanate hai to kuch vidwaan inkaa janm 550 or 650 i0 ke madhya maanate hai
 The question of when Dandi took place and what are his compositions is still controversial
 unka jeevanavrutt bhi vishesh gyaat nahin he
 Based on both 'avantisundari Katha' and 'avantisundari Kathasar' available in South India, so much has been known about his life that Damodar Pandit, the great-grandfather of Dandi was
 ve kadachit bharavi ke mitra the
 With his help, the Chalukyavanshi could reach near King Vishnuvardhana
 bharavi kii chauthi peedi main dandi kaa janm huatha
 He lived his life in the shelter of Kanchinaresh
 kannada bhashaa ke alankarigranth 'kavrajmarg' par dandi ke 'kavyadarsh' kaa yathesht prabhaav dekhakar tathaa sinhalai ke alankarigranth 'sita-bas-lakar' ko kavyadarsh ke aadharaper nirmit paakar itnaa nishchit he ki naveen shatabdi se purv dandi vartmaan the
 Thus 'laxm Laxmi Tanotiti', based on a famous passage of Kalidasa from this quote, the period of Dandi is indiscriminately post Kalidasa
 produo pathak ke mat se kavyadarsh kaa hetuvishyak vibhaag -- bhartruhari ke aadhaar par hone se kavyadarsh kii rachana 650 itho ke baad hui hogi
 Kavyadarshakta Rajavarma can be considered as the late seventh century and the eighth beginning of Dandi, as against those who consider Narasimhavarma ii's surname or surname
 yadi 'kavyadarsh' ke ek shloke par kadambari ke shuknashopadesh kaa prabhaav sweekaar kiya jaay to unka kaal -- banbhatta ke bhi ananthar hota he
 The above statement is also confirmed by the opinion of those who consider Avantisundari Kathasar as a masterpiece
 parantu kuch vidwaan dandi ko subandhu se purv or kuch log unhen banbhatta kaa bhi purvavarti maanate hai
 According to the second vote, Subandhu, Dandi and Baan - all three were born between 550 AD and 650 AD
 in logon ke mat se 'avantisundari katha' yaa 'kathasaar' ko dandikrut maanane main aapatti he
 According to the legend and Subhashit, three compositions of Dandi are described as Vishruta
 pratham rachana 'kavyadarsh' or duusari he 'dashakumarcharit'
 Most scholars have accepted this, but some other scholars - assuming both of them to be a litterateur, assume the creation of two different persons named Dandi
 iskaa ek pramukh kaaran yah he ki kavyashastra ke jin maanya siddhanton kaa 'kavyadarsh' main pratipaadan or nirdesh miltaa he, 'dashakumarcharit' main uski asangati or virodh dikhaai detaa he
 Therefore, the inconsistency of the doctrine and practice of Acharya and Poetry indicates one or two different creations
 parantu adhiktar vidwaanon ke anusaar ukt asangati kaa kaaran yah maan liya gaya he ki apane saahitiyik jivan ke aarambhkaal main mahakavi ne 'dashakumarcharit' kii rachana kii thi
 'kavyadarsha' is the creation of maturity when the classical masculinity of Dandi matured
 at: in donon kritiyon ko dandi rachit maanane main adhiktar vidwaanon ko koi vipratipatti nahin he
 But the determination of the third work is still controversial
 'pirol' ke mat se shudrakarchit kaha janevaala 'mrichctic' hi dandi kii tritiy rachana he
 One of its grounds is the quotation of a line in 'kavyadarsha' without a name 'mruthaktik'
 doosraa kaaran he -- 'mrichauctic' or 'dashakumarcharit' donon main chitrit samaaj evam unke paatro ke charitrachitran main atyadhik samya
 The first reason is not an important reason
 doosraa keval itnaa hi suchit karata he ki donon hi kritiyaan praaia: samakaleen samaaj ke yugabodh kaa yathaarthonmukh or jeevant chithran karne main prayatnsheel hai
 'mallikamarut' is also sometimes called punitive
 par vah 15veen sadi ke 'udand ranganath' kii kriti he
 'avantisundarikatha' is now considered by many scholars to be the third composition of Dandi based on the stories of 'daskumarcharit'
 donon gadhykavyon kii shailigat bhinnata ko dekhakar kuch panditon ne uske dandikrut hone main aapatti kii he
 But other scholars accept the third composition of Dandi as unambiguous, considering it to be the construction of 'daskumarcharit' in the style of puberty and the 'avantisundarikatha' in the mature style of maturity
 kuch log -- 'avantisundarikatha' ko 'dashakumar charit' kii khoi hui purv peethika maanane lage hai
 'dasakumarcharit' is an important and famous work in three famous Sanskrit prose
 vah kavy kii kathastyli main likhit he
 Dashakumarcharit's linguistic style is more literary and poetic than the simple prose and practical prose style of 'mahabhashya' and ancient Upanishads, 'hitopadesh' etc
 parantu subandhu or baan kii alankrita evam kalatmak gadhyshailee se yah bhinn he
 Although the maturation of the miraculous ornate style of miracles is mature in Subandhu and mature in arrows, the characterization of characters and characters in both of them is bleak rather than 'decapitated'
 kalamulak adarshavadita ne 'vaasavadatta' or 'kadambari' kii style ko yatharthonmukh parivesh se dur hataakar kuch kritrim bana diya he
 But in Dandi's prose style, the effect of that 'extreme' and platitude is not borderline
 'dashakumarcharit' par sambhavat: pashachi bhashavali gunanty kii brihatkatha kaa prabhaav padaa he
 Probably for this reason, 'dashkumarcharit' has also influenced the stories of folklore
 kahani main duusari, teesri aadi kii shrunkhlaa ko jodne kaa rachanavidhan bhi yahan lakshith hota he
 It gives a very lively depiction of the weaknesses and strengths of the seventh eighth century society, the narrow and selfish political struggles of that period, the working weaknesses of the multitude of people, and the blind, superstitions and theoretical and practical hats of the Tadugin society
 vibhinn shreniyon or virgon ke vyaktimadhyam se kiye gaye vargparak charitrachitran main tatkaaleen samaaj kii sajiv jhaanki dikhaai padati he
 Overall, the poet has made sufficient marking of the real life of the era
 is granth kii purvapithika ke paanch uchhvas or uttar peethika ke ansh ko praaia: sabhi vidwaan dandi rachit nahin maanate
 They accept writing by other authors
 purvapithika or uttarpithika kii abhivyaktistylee madhya ke aath uchhvaason se bhinn he
 Validative descriptiveness in both also indicates different points of view
 ho saktaa he, iske aarambhik or antim ansh nasht bhrasht ho gaye hon, parantu nishchay hi dandilikhit donon peethikaaon ke madhya kaa ansh upkram or upsanhaar se rahit he
 It is also said that the plan of this scripture, which Dandi had in mind, was a follower of the 'brihatkha' of Paishachi
 usamen lokkathaon kaa vishaal sangrah karne kaa vichaar bhale hi rahaa ho, par vah apurna rah gai
 Some people consider this book to be ethics or preaching
 parantu isaki rachana mukhyat: kaavyatmak he or saundaryabodh ke aswadanarth hi hui he
 At some places, the obscenity defect that is told in it is somewhat similar to that in 'kumarasambhava', 'naishcharcharit', 'shishupala Slaughter' or 'kiratarjuniyam'
 dandi dwaara 'dashakumarcharit' main prayukt shabd sankhya 'kadambari' yaa 'vaasavadatta' main prayukt shabdon kii apeksha adhik bataai jaati he
 For these and other reasons, Dandi is unique among Sanskrit prose writers
 kavyadarsh dandi kii aisi rachana he jo kavyashastra ke vichaar se vishesh mahatv kii he
 Only 'bhamah', in contrast to the 'natyashastra' related to cinematography, is ancient to rhetorical such texts whose time is available
 parantu unki kriti 'kaavyalankar' kii apeksha dandi kaa 'kavyadarsh' adhik praudh, adhik vyapak or adhik vyavasthit he
 He has influenced the texts and works of many composers of the latter
 'avantisundarikatha' bhi ek praudh gadhykavy he
 But in the controversial and incomplete texts of his work, it is enough to say that he is an adult prose, without saying anything special here
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki 'dashakumarcharit' kii vah purvapithika rahi ho
 In all, we can call Dandi an excellent poet and high-class ornamented in terms of Tadugin Shastrabodh
