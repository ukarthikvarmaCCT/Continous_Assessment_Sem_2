 There is no poet of this community who has not paid his poetic tribute to his Yamuna
 unka yamuna stuti sambandhi sahitya brajabhasha bhakthi kavy kaa ek ullekhneey ang he
 The origin of the Yamuna is the Kalind Parvat, located at 7,7 to 8 miles north-west of the snowy Shringa Bandar Punchh in the Himalayas, after which the Yamuna is called Kalindja or Kalindi
 apane udgam se aage kai mile tak vishaal himegaaron or hinm mandit kandaraon main aprakat rup se bahati hui tathaa pahari dhalaanon par se atyant tivrathapurvak utarati hui isaki dhara yamunottaree parvat se prakat hoti he

 During prehistoric times, Yamuna flowed under Madhuban, where the first city of Mathura was established on its banks, in the Valmiki Ramayana and Vishnu Purana, its details are found

 European scholar Tavernier, who visited India in the seventeenth century, had estimated that there was a stream of Yamuna at some time by looking at the land near Katra
 is sandarbh main grouj kaa mat he ki aitihaasik kaal main katra ke sameep yamuna ke pravaahit hone kii sambhaavna kam he, kintu atyant pracheen kaal main vahaan yamuna avashya thi

 Was also present near aisa anumaan he, yamuna kii vah shakha buddha kaal ke bahut baad tak sambhawatah solahavin shatabdi tak keshav dev mandir ke neeche bahati rahi thi
 The first two Varsati rivers 'saraswati' and 'krishna Ganga' flow into the western part of Mathura and fall into the Yamuna, which commemorates the river Saraswati Sangam of Yamuna and the river called Krishna Ganga
 sambhav he yamuna kii un sahaayak naadiyon main se hi koi katra ke paas bahati rahi ho
 It is known from the talk literature of the Ballabh sect that the river Yamuna used to flow near Jamunavati village in Saraswat Kalpa

 sahitya darpan sanskrit bhashaa main likhaa gaya sahitya vishyak granth he jiske lekhak pandit vishwanath hai
 The time of Vishwanath is attributed to the 14th century
 mammat ke kavyprakash ke samaan hi sahityadarpan bhi saahityalochana kaa ek pramukh granth he
 In relation to both the audio and visual discernment of poetry, there is a wide expression of ideas in this book
 isak vibhaajan 10 parichchhedon main he
 Sahitya Darpan is divided into 10 passages: pratham pariched main kavy prayojan, lakshan aadi prastut karte hue granthkaar ne mammat ke kavy lakshan "taddoshau shabdaarthon sagunavanlankriti pun: kwapi" kaa khandan kiya he or apane dwaara prastut lakshan vaakyan rasaatmakan kavyam ko hi shuddhtam kavy lakshan pratipaadit kiya he
 This is an old tradition of predestination and autocracy
 dwitiya pariched main vachya or pad kaa lakshan kehane ke baad shabd kii shaktiyon - abhidha, lakshana, tathaa vyanjana kaa vivechan or vargeekaran kiya gaya he
 In the third passage there is a discussion of rasa-nishtpa and in the same passage the hero-heroine-distinction is also considered along with the beauty of the beauty
 chaturth pariched main kavy ke bhed dhvanikavy or gunibhoot-vyangyakavy aadi kaa vivechan he
 The fifth passage has an argumentative refutation and support of all opinions opposed to sound theory
 chhathen pariched main naatyashaastra se sambandhit vishyon kaa pratipaadan he
 This passage is the largest and has about 300 books, while the entire book has the number 760
 saptam pariched main dosha nirupan
 Discussion of the three qualities in the eighth passage
 navam pariched main vaidarbhi, gaudi, panchali aadi ritiyon par vichaar kiya gaya he
 The tenth passage depicts the illustration of figures of speech, including a total of 89 figures of speech, 70 Arthalankaras and Rasavatas etc
 isaki apni visheshta he - chatha pariched, jisamen naatyashaastra se sambhddha sabhi vishyon kaa krambaddh rup se samavesh kar diya gaya he
 This is the most detailed passage of Sahitya Darpan
 kavyprakash tathaa sanskrit sahitya ke pramukh lakshan granthon main natya sambandhi ansh nahin milte
 Also, there is no idea about hero-heroine-distinction etc
 sahitya darpan ke tisare pariched main ras nirupan ke saath-saath nayak-nayika-bhed par bhi vichaar kiya gaya he
 This is also its specialty of this book
 purvavarti aacharyon ke maton ko yuktipurna khandanadi hote hue bhi kavy prakaash kii tarah jatilta isamen nahin milti
 Visual poetry is based on the Natyashastra and Dhanik's visualization in it
 ras, dhwani or gunibhoot vyangy kaa vivechan adhikanshat: dhvanyalok or kavy prakaash ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he tathaa alankaar prakaran visheshat: rajanak ruyyak ke "alankaar sarvasv" par aadhaarit he
 Probably that is why even after dissecting these Acharyas, the writer considers them to be his precepts and expresses respect for him - "ikshilmupajijyamananananamyanan Lecturer, Katakshinakshapeen" "mahanta Sanstava and Bangaurvay" etc
 sahitya darpan main kavy kaa lakshan bhi apane purvavarti aacharyon se swatantra rup main kiya gaya miltaa he
 The earlier poetic features in the earlier texts from Sahitya Darpan have progressively expanded and by the time they reach Chandralok, they have become more elaborate, which is visible from this sequence- is prakaar kramash: vistrut hote kavyalakshan ke rup ko sahityadarpanakaar ne "vaakyam rasaatmakam kavyam" jaise chote rup main band diya he
 It is expressed from Keshav Mishra's Alankarashekhar that this poetic characteristic of Sahityadarpan is the refined and abbreviated form of Acharya Shauddhodani's "poetry Rasadimad Sentam Shruta Sukhvishkritakrit"
 vishwanath ne sahityadarpan main mahakavy kaa vishad or sangopang vivechan nimnavat kiya he- Following are the main features related to the epic from the above description- is prakaar praayah prayek shaastrakaar ne apane samay main uplabdh mahakavyon ke aadhaar par mahakavy ke lakshanon kaa vidhaan kiya he, lekin adhikansh aadhunik vichaarak vishwanath ke vichaaron ko pramanik maanate hai or parvarti mahakavyon main to vishwanath ke mat ko adhikadhik grahya samajha gaya he

 mandir devsthan hindu dharm main mandir chaar pramukh shaileyon ke hote hai-- Disilane is an inorganic compound
 shaarang hindu devtaa bhagwaan vishnu kaa dhanush he
 Other weapons of Vishnu include Sudarshan Chakra, Narayanastra, Vaishnavastra, Kaumodaki Gada and Nandak Talwar
 yah dhanush, bhagwaan shiv ke dhanush pinaak ke saath, vishwavyaapee vaastulakaar or astr-shastron ke nirmaataa vishwakarma dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 Once, Lord Brahma wanted to know who was the better archer among them, Vishnu or Shiva
 tab brahma ne donon ke bich jhagada paidaa kiya, jiske kaaran ek bhayanak dwandvayuddh hua
 Due to this war, the balance of the entire universe was disturbed
 lekin jald hi vishnu ne apane baanon se shiv ko parajeet kiya
 All other gods, along with Brahma, urged both of them to stop the war and proclaimed Vishnu the victor as he was able to defeat Shiva
 krodhit bhagwaan shiv ne apane dhanush pinaak ko ek raja ko de diya, jo sita ke pita raja janak ke purvaj the
 Lord Vishnu also decided to do the same, and gave his bow Sharang to the sage Hrishik
 samay ke saath, shaarang, bhagwaan vishnu ke chathe avatar or rishi richik ke pautra parashuram ko praapt hua
 Parashurama, after fulfilling the purpose of his life, gave sharang to Lord Rama, the next incarnation of Vishnu
 ram ne iskaa prayog kiya or ise jalmandal ke devtaa varun ko diya
 In the Mahabharata, Varuna gave Sharang to Lord Krishna during khandava-dahan
 mrityu se thik pehle, krishna ne is dhanush ko mahaasaagar main phenkakar varun ko waapas lautaa diya
 Sharang appears during a duel between Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu and the demon Shlava of mystical powers
 shalve ne krishna ke baayen haath par hamalaa kiya jisase krishna ke haathon se shaarang chhot gaya
 Later, Lord Krishna severed the head of the shalva from the Sudarshan Chakra
 ek anya katha ke anusaar, jab janak ne ghoshnaa kii ki jo bhi sita se vivaah karnaa chahta he use pinaak naamak divya dhanush uthaanaa hoga or isaki pratyancha chadhaani hogi
 Prince Rama of Ayodhya extradited this bow and married Sita
 vivaah ke baad jab unke pita dasharath ram ke saath ayodhya laut rahe the, parashuram ne unke maarg ko roka or apane guru shiv ke dhanush pinaak ko todane ke liye ram ko chunauti di
 Rama dissolved the bow
 is par dasharath ne rishi parashuram se use kshamaa karne ke liye prarthana kii lekin parashuram or bhi krodhit hue or unhone vishnu ke dhanush shaarang ko liya or ram se dhanush ko baandhne or uske saath ek dwandvayuddh ladane ke liye kaha
 Rama took Vishnu's bow Sharang, tied it, placed an arrow in it and pointed that arrow towards Parasurama
 tab ram ne parashuram se poocha ki vah tir kaa lakshya kya denge
 At this, Parashurama considers himself devoid of his mystical energy
 vah mahasoos karte hai ki ram vishnu kaa hi avatar he
 Komaram Bhima Asifabad is a district in the state of Telangana, India
 khat bhartiya sangeet ke ek raag kaa naam he
 In this raga, Rishabh, Dhaivat, Nishad and both pure and gentle are used

 However, one of the main objectives of the Dutch was not to do business with India and to establish it as a link for their trade in the countries of East Asia and on the other, the British and the Franciscans defeated them in wars both here and in Europe
 is kaaran dachon kaa prabhutv bahut dinon tak bharat main nahin rah paaya tha

 Since the early 1980s, a global dark sky movement has emerged under which people concerned have been campaigning to reduce the amount of light pollution
 prakaash pradooshan, audyogic sabhyataa kaa ek paksh prabhaav he
 Its sources include exterior construction and interior lighting, advertising, commercial properties, offices, factories, street lights and resplendent sports venues
 It is most severe in highly industrialized, densely populated areas of North America, Europe and Japan, and is the same in major cities in the Middle East and North Africa, such as Tehran and Cairo, but relatively small amounts of light can also be seen
 Is and can cause problems
 pradooshan ke anya roopon kii tarah prakaash pradooshan paryaavaran ko nuksaan pahunchaata he
 Advocates of energy conservation argue that light pollution must be improved by changing the habits of society, so that lights are used more efficiently with less wastage and no unwanted or unnecessary light is produced
 kai udyog samoohon ne bhi prakaash pradooshan ko ek mahatvapurn mudda mana he
 For example, the Institution of Lighting Engineers in the United Kingdom provides its members with information about light pollution and the problems caused by it and also explains how to reduce it
 chunki sabhi ek hi prakaash strot se pareshaan nahin hote hai, yah aam he ki jo prakaash ek vyakti ke liye prakaash "pradooshan" hoga vah kisi anya vyakti ke liye vaanchhneeya prakaash hoga
 An example of this is found in advertising, when an advertiser wants a particular light to be bright and clear, even if others are in trouble with it
 anya prakaar ke prakaash pradooshan adhik vishisht hai
 For example, light that accidentally crosses someone's property boundary and annoys a neighbor is usually pointless and polluted light

 Where objective measurement is desired, light levels can be determined by field measurements or mathematical modeling, where the results can typically be represented as isophot maps or light contour line maps
 adhikariyon ne bhi prakaash pradooshan se nipatane ke liye kai upayon ko apanaaya he, jo shaamil samaaj ke hiton, vishwaason or samaj par nirbhar karata he

 Typical categories of light pollution include light trespass, extreme twinkling, glare, light clutter and sky illumination
 a single annoying light source often falls under more than one of these categories
 prakaash atichaar tab hota he jab avaanchit prakaash kisi kii sampatti main pravesh karata he, udhaaharan ke liye ek padosi ke baad par jagamagaahat dwaara

 To protect the rights of its citizens against light trespass, standards have been developed for outdoor lighting in many cities of the US
 unhen sahaayta karne ke liye, antarrashtriya dark ski association ne adarsh prakaash vyavastha niyamon ko viksit kiya he
 Dark Sky Association was started to reduce the light going up in the sky, which reduces the visibility of stars, see Sky illumination below
 It can be any light that is emitted more than 90 degrees above the endpoint
 prakaash ko is 90 degree ke nishaan par simit karke unhone 80-90 degree range main prakaash output ko kam kiya he jo prakaash atichaar ke adhikansh muddon ko utpann karata he
 US federal agencies may also enforce standards and procedure complaints within their jurisdiction
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanchaar toweron ke strob prakaash se FAA nunatam prakaash aavashyaktaaon se adhik hone vaale prakaash atichaar ke maamle main sangheey sanchaar ayog ek antina sanrachana panjikaran database jaankaree rakhata he jiskaa istemaal naagarik kshtakaari nirmaanon kii pahchaan karne ke liye kar sakate hai or upabhokta jaanch or shikayaton ke prasanskaran ke liye ek tantra pradaan kar sakate hai
 The American Green Building Council has also included a standard in its eco-friendly building called LEED, an assessment to reduce light trespass and sky illumination
 prakaash atichaar ko aise prakaash judanar ke chayan se kam kiya ja saktaa jo adhobindu se upar 80 degree se zyada utsarjit prakaash kii maatra ko simit karata he
 The IESNA definition includes full cut, cut and semi cut
 prakaash kaa atyadhik upyog ati-jagamagaahat kehalaata he
 Over-twinkling, especially within the United States, accounts for approximately two million barrels of oil per day in energy waste
 yah america kii petroleum kii 50 million barrels per day kii samaan maatra kii khapat par aadhaarit he
 It has been further noted in the US Department of Energy that more than 30 percent of all energy is consumed by the commercial, industrial and residential sectors

 Thus lighting contributes about four to five million barrels of oil per day
 urja audit data darshaate hai ki prakaash vyavastha main prayukt 30-60 pratishat kii urja avaanchit yaa ni:shulk hoti he
 The us According to the DOE, an alternative calculation starts with the fact that commercial building lighting consumes 81
68 terawatt power
 is prakaar vanijyik prakaash vyavastha akele petroleum ke pratidin kareeb chaar se paanch bairal tel kii khapat karti he, jo america prakaash urja khapat kaa anumaan laagne ke liye upar ke vaikalpik auchity se mail khaataa he
 Over-twinkling occurs due to several factors: in muddon main se adhikansh ko aasaani se uplabdh, sasti takanic ke saath thik kiya ja saktaa he or makaan maalik / kiraayedaar ke abhyaason dwaara jo in maamalon ke teevr sudhaar ke liye baadha utpann karte hai
 Most importantly, public awareness will be required for industrialized countries to realize the great benefits of reducing over-twinkling
 chamak ko vibhinn prakaar main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 One such classification is described in a book by Bob Mizon, coordinator of the British Astronomical Associations Campaign for Dark Sky
 is vargeekaran ke anusaar: According to Mario Motta, president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, "


 the flash of bad light is a threat to public health ‚Äî especially as it increases with increasing age
 ankhon main padataa chamakta prakaash ankhon ke contrast ko haani pahunchaa saktaa he or asurakshit driving sthitiyon ko utpann kar saktaa he, jo kaaphi kuch gande windshield par nune kone se padate suraj ke prakaash jaisaa hota he yaa saamne aati car kii sidhi raushnee ke samaan hota he
 "in short, bright and / or badly shielded lights on the roads can partially blind drivers or pedestrians and cause accidents
 andhta prabhaav mukhya rup se atyadhik chamak se ankhon main bikharati raushnee ke kaaran ghatit viparyaas dwaara utpann hota he, yaa andhere kshetron se drushti path par aati raushnee ke kaaran, jahaan chakachaundh prishthbhumi chakachaundh ke samaan hoti he
 This type of glare is a special example of disability glare, which is called screen glare
 roshni ke atyadhik samoohon ko prakaash avyavashtha kehete hai
 Groups of lights can cause confusion, distract from obstacles, and potentially cause accidents
 avyavashtha ko vishesh rup se sadak par dekha ja saktaa he jahaan street lite kaa dizin bura hota he, yaa jahaan tej roshni vaale vigyaapan sadak ko ghere hote hai
 Depending on the intent of the person or organization installing the lights, their location and design may also be distracting to drivers and may contribute to accidents
 prakaash kolahal, vimaanan paryaavaran ke liye bhi khatra utpann kar saktaa he yadi vimaanan suraksha prakaash ko payalat ke dhyaan ke liye gaiyr-praasangik prakaashon ke saath muqabla karnaa pade
 udhaaharan ke liye, hawaii adde kii prakaash vyavastha, upnagareey vanijyik prakaash ke saath bhramit ho sakati he or vimaan takaraav parihaar roshni ko bhramit hokar ground lits samajha ja saktaa he
 Sky-illumination refers to the "glow" effect that can be seen on populated areas
 yah us sabhi prakaash kaa sangyojan he jo shahar kii raushnee se pratibimbit hote hue upar akaash main bikharata he or saath hi us kshetra main sabhi kharaab nirdeshit prakaash se bhi jo akaash main nikal jaataa he or vaataavaran dwaara waapas dharti par bikher diya jaataa he
 This scattering is very strongly related to the wavelength of light when the air is very clear
 Rayleigh scattering dominates in such a clear air, making the sky appear blue by day
 jab vahaan kaaphi airosol hota he, bikhare hue prakaash kii tarangadairghy par kam nirbharta hoti he, jisase din kaa akaash apekshaakrit dhaval hota he
 Due to this Rayleigh effect and the increased sensitivity of the eyes to white or blue rich light sources when adapted with extremely low levels of light, light filled with white or blue, compared to the same amount of yellow light Contributes significantly more to the sky illumination
 akaash-pradipti se khagolavidon ko vishesh pareshaani hoti he, kyonki isse ratrikalin akaash main viparyaas kii is had tak kami ho jaati he ki sarvaadhik chamak vaale sitaron ke alaava anya taron ko dekhnaa asambhav ho jaataa he
 The Bortle dark-sky Scale, originally published in Sky and Telescope magazine, is sometimes used to determine the amount of sky-illumination and general sky-clarity
 nau-varg paimaana, ratrikalin-akaash ke andhere or uski ghatana ko darja detaa he, jaise ki gegenshine or raashi chakra prakaash or paimaane par prayek str kaa vistrut vivaran uplabdh karaata he
 Lighting is particularly problematic for the sky's amateur amateur, whose ability to observe amateur night sky is likely to be inhibited by anyone who stray from his property
 adhikansh pramukh optical khagoleey vedhashalaayein prakaash utsarjan par sakhti se lagu pratibandh ke kshetron se ghiri hoti hai
 "direct" sky-illumination can be reduced by selecting light fixtures that limit the amount of light emitted more than 90 degrees above the midpoint

 Measuring the effects of sky-illumination on a global scale is a complex process
 swaabhaavik vaataavaran puri tarah se andhakaarmay nahin he, yahaan tak ki chandramaa se milane vaale prakaash ke sthaliy sroton or ujaale ke abhaav main bhi nahin
 This is due to two main sources: air-illumination and diffuse light
 atyant oonchai par, mukhya rup se mesosphier ke upar, surya se paryaapt maatra main laghu tarang dairghy kaa para-begni vikiran hota he jisase ynikaran hota he

 Reducing light pollution has several implications, such as reducing sky-illumination, reducing glare, reducing light trespass and reducing clutter
 prakaash pradooshan ko kam karne kaa sabase acha tarika, isliye kisi die gaye maahaul main is baat par nirbhar karata he ki vastav main samasya kya he
 Possible solutions include: purna katautee prakaash vyavastha judanar ke upyog kii, jitna sambhav ho sake, prakaash pradooshan kii kami ke liye adhikansh prachaarkon dwaara salaah di jaati he
 In general, it is also recommended that the lights should be positioned at the proper distance for maximum efficiency and not to rival lamps within the fixtures
 purna katautee judanar sabase pehle general electric ke M100 judanar ke saath 1959 main uplabdh hua
 a full cut fixtures, when properly installed, reduce the chance of light reaching above the horizontal surface

 When it enters the atmosphere, this light contributes to sky-illumination
 kuch sarkaar or sanghathan ab vichaar kar rahe hai yaa pehle se hi street lamp or stadium prakaash vyavastha main, purna katautee judanar ko lagu kar diya he
 The use of full-cut fixtures can help reduce sky-illumination by preventing unnecessary spread of light
 purna katautee aamtaur par ek lamp kii drishyata ko kam karata he yaa prakaash upkaran ke bheetar paravartak kii drishyata ko kam kar detaa he, isliye chamak kaa prabhaav bhi kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Campaigners also commonly argue that full cuts are more efficient than fixtures and other fixtures, because lights that would otherwise have spread to the environment may be directed toward the ground instead
 haalanki, purna katautee judanar, judanar ke bheetar anya prakaash upkaran kii tulana main adhik prakaash ko baandhte hai, jisase upkaran kii dakshata kam hoti he
 The use of full-cut fixtures allows a lower watt lamp to be used in fixtures, creating a similar or sometimes better effect, which is why it is more carefully controlled
 har prakaash vyavastha main, jameen se parilakshith roshni bhi akaash pradipti main yogadan karti he
 This reflection can be reduced, however, by using the appropriate wattage required for the lamp and keeping the proper distance between the lights
 purna katautee prakaash judanar kii ek aam aalochana yah he ki ve dekhne main kabhi-kabhi utane manabhaavan nahin hote hai
 This is presumably because historically there has not been a large market specifically for full-cut fixtures and because people generally prefer to see a source of illumination
 apane prakaash kii disha ke saath vishistataa ke kaaran, purna katautee judanar ko kabhi kabhi adhiktam prabhaav ke liye sthapit karne ke liye visheshgyata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The effectiveness of using full-cut road lights to combat light pollution has also been brought under question

 These simulations optimized the height and distance of the light while limiting the overall design to meet IESNA requirements and then comparing the total uplight and energy consumption to the design and strengths of the different lighting devices
 katautee diginon ne purna katautee diginon kii tulana main behatar pradarshan kiya or arddh katautee diginon ne katautee or purna katautee se behatar pradarshan kiya
 This suggests that poor uniformity generated by over-twinkling or full-cut fixtures in road installations may be more damaging than direct uplight produced by lower-cut or half-cut fixtures
 isliye, maujuuda pranali ke samgr pradarshan ko prakaash upkaran kii sankhya ko kam karte hue sudhara ja saktaa he or naa ki purna katautee dizin main parivartan karte hue
 However, only full-cut designs prevent light pollution, using the definition of "light pollution" of some Italian regional bills

 The same law also applies the minimum distance between a street lamp four times its height, so a full cut street lamp is the best solution to reduce light pollution and electricity usage

 Many astronomers request that the surrounding community use as much light sodium sodium light as possible, as it is relatively easy to operate at major emitted wavelengths
 oparating sodium roshni kii kam laagat ek or visheshta he
 For example, in 1980 San Jose, California, replaced all street lamps with low pressure sodium lamps whose light is easy to filter for the Lick Observatory
 isi tarah ke kaaryakramon ko hawaii or arizona main shuru kiya gaya
 The disadvantage of low pressure sodium light is that the fixtures generally have to be larger than the competing fixtures and the color cannot be distinguished mainly because a single emission emits its wavelength
 Such high wattage as control from low pressure sodium lighting equipment of 135 w and 180 w light emission is more difficult, especially due to the adequate size of the lamp
 un anuprayogon ke liye jinhen prakaash kii adhik sateek disha kii zarurat hoti he ucch daab sodium lamp kii tulana main kam kiya jaataa he or puri tarah kho diya ja saktaa he
 The allegation that this also increases the amount of light pollution is due to the inefficiency of the equipment that drives these lamps, mainly because the shielding is still widely in use in the UK and poor in some other places
 khapat or kam drishy prakaash pradooshan urja aadhunik kam dabaav sodium judanar ke saath behatar prakaashiki or parirakshan or purna pile prakaash kii raksha kii kami akaash-pradipti prabhaavon chamakdaar kam kii prabhavakaarita laabh kam dabaav sodium or parinaam main adhikansh maamalon he
 Unfortunately, due to the lack of accurate information to continue, many lighting professionals continue to ignore the low pressure of sodium, contributing to the use of light and its acceptance standards and hence its acceptance standards
 Another disadvantage of low pressure sodium lamps is that some people find yellow light to be unpleasant to look at
 vaataavaran dwaara prakaash ke bikharaav kii vajah se, vibhinn strot naatakeey rup se alag maatra main akaash-pradipti kaa utpaadan karte hai
 In some cases, evaluation of existing plans has determined that more efficient lighting planning is possible

 Such a measure provides an easily applicable environmental protection barrier on traditional "regulations", which are usually based on lighting recommendations, which cannot take into account environmental norms

 In an effort to reduce light pollution, researchers have developed an "integrated system of photometry" that determines how much and what type of street light is needed
 pranali ke bhamiti ekikrut kii anumati detaa he prakaash judanar suraksha or karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya kam urja kaa upyog karte samay suraksha ko banaae rakhane yaa sudhaar vichaaron kii drishyata

 Using this new system of photometry, results from recent studies have indicated that replacing conventional, yellow, high-pressure sodium light with fluorescent, holiday metal lights or leds actually results in energy savings, while Visibility also improves at night

 Panchatantra is considered the first place in Sanskrit fables
 yadhyapi yah pustak apane mul rup main nahin rah gayi he, phir bhi uplabdh anuwaadon ke aadhaar par isaki rachana teesri shatabdi isa purv ke aas- paas nirdhaarit kii gai he
 The author of this book is Pt
 Vishnu Sharma
 uplabdh pramaanon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki jab is granth kii rachana puri hui, tab unki umr lagbhag 80 varsh thi
 Panchatantra is divided into five mechanisms: manovigyaan, vyavhaarikta tathaa rajkaaj ke siddhanton se parichit karaati ye kahaniyaan sabhi vishyon ko bade hi rochak tareeke se saamne rakhti he tathaa saath hi saath ek sikh dene kii koshish karti he
 In many stories of Panchatantra, in addition to human characters, many times animals and birds have also been made characters of the story and an attempt has been made to say many instructive things to them
 panchatantra kii kahaniyaan bahut jeevant hai
 In this, public behavior is explained in a very simple way
 bahut se log is pustak ko netritv kshamta viksit karne kaa ek shashakt madhyam maanate hai
 The importance of this book is propounded by the fact that it has been translated into almost every language of the world
 nitikthaon main panchatantr kaa pehla sthaan he
 The Panchatantra is the basis of the composition of the interests
 swayan narayan pandit ji ne sweekaar kiya he- Its composition is set around the third century, based on the various available translations
 panchatantra kii rachana kis kaal main hui, yah nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki panchatantra kii mul prati abhi tak uplabdh nahin he
 Some scholars have presented their views about the author of Panchatantra and its creation period in the language style of Panchatantra
 mahamahopadhyaay pan sadashiv shastri ke anusaar panchatantra ke rachayita vishnusharma the or vishnusharma chanakya kaa hi doosraa naam tha
 Therefore, the Panchatantra was composed during the time of Chandragupta Maurya and its composition period was 300 BC
 may be considered
 par paashchaatya tathaa kuch bhartiya vidvan aisa nahin maanate, unka kathan he ki chanakya kaa doosraa naam vishnugupt tha vishnusharma nahin, tathaa uplabdh panchatantra kii bhashaa kii drushti se to yah guptakaleen rachana prathit hoti he
 Mahamahopadhyaya Pt Durgaprasad Sharma has considered the time of Vishnusarma in the middle of the Ashtamashakta because the first system of Panchatantra saw the Arya Arya of Kuttinimat composed by Damodar Gupta of the eighth century A
D
 Must have occurred in parantu keval ukt shloke ke adhar par panchatantra kii rachana ashtum shatak main nahin maani ja sakati, kyonki yah shloke kisi sanskaran main prakshipt bhi ho saktaa he
 Hertel and Dr
 Keith, its composition 200 BC Is in favor of obeying
 chanakya ke arthshaastra kaa prabhaav bhi panchatantra main dikhaai detaa he iske adhar par bhi yah kaha ja saktaa he ki chanakya kaa samay lagbhag chaturth shatabdi purv kaa he atah panchatantra kii rachana teesri shatabdi ke purv hui hogi
 Thus, none of the views regarding the creation of Panchatantra is completely unanimous
 sanskaran-panchatantra ke chaar sanskaran uplabdh he- The first edition is the Pahlavi translation of the original text, which is now received in the form of Syrian and Arabic translations
 dwitiya sanskaran ke rup main panchatantra gunadhyakrut ‚Äòbrihatkatha‚Äô main dikhaai padataa he
 'brihatkatha' was composed in the Paisachi language but its original form has been destroyed and the Kshemarikrit 'brihatkatha Manjari' and 'kathasaritsagar' written by Somdev are translations of the same
 tritiy sanskaran main tantrakhyayika evam usase sambaddh jain kathaon kaa sangrah he
 'tantrayakhya' is considered to be the most ancient
 iskaa mul sthaan kashmir he
 The famous German scholar Dr
 Hertel discovered the authentic version with great exertion
 inke anusaar ‚Äòtantrakhyayika‚Äô yaa tantrakhya hi panchatantra kaa mularoop he
 This is the prevalent 'panchatantra' of the modern era
 chaturth sanskaran dakshini ‚Äòpanchatantra‚Äô kaa mularoop he tathaa iskaa pratinidhitiv nepali ‚Äòpanchatantra‚Äô evam ‚Äòhitopadesh‚Äô karte hai
 Thus 'panchatantra' is a representative of a huge literature rather than a book
 vishwa-sahitya main bhi panchatantra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 It has been translated into many foreign languages
 in anuwaadon main pahalavi bhashaa kaa ‚Äòkartakadamanak‚Äô naam kaa anuwaad hi sabase pracheen anuwaad mana jaataa he
 According to Winternitz, the greater influence of Panchatantra is seen on German literature
 isi prakaar greek kii isap kii kahaniyon kaa tathaa arab kii 'arebian nits' aadi kathaon kaa aadhaar panchatantra hi he
 It is believed that the Panchatantra has been translated into about 50 diverse languages so far and there have been about 200 versions of it
 yahi isaki lokapriyata kaa parichaayak he
 There are five tantras or divisions in the Panchatantra
 vibhaag ko tantra isliye kaha gaya he kyonki inamen naitiktapurna shashan kii vidhiyaan bataayin gayin hai
 These systems are friendly, friendly, attaining Kakolukiyam, beneficial and obtrusive
 sankshep main in tantron kii vishaywastu is prakaar he- There is a main story in the fables and there are many minor stories to corroborate it
 Similarly, in this first system called 'mitradhabha', the story of Amarashakti, the king of Mahilaropya in the south of Angikatha, is told that he is his The reason for the foolish sons was anxious and hence they entrust a scholar named Vishnusharma to educate their sons and Vishnusharma was given to them
 They are successful in educating through stories in the month itself
 tatpashchaat mitrabhed naamak bhaag kii angi-katha main, ek dusht siyaar dwaara pingalak naamak singh ke saath sanjeevak naamak bail kii shatruta utpann karaane kaa varnan he jise singh ne aapatti se bachaaya tha or apane do mantriyon- karkat or damanak ke virodh karne par bhi use apana mitra bana liya tha
 Many types of teachings have been given in this system, such that a person can face even the most difficult situation with patience, so one should not give up patience even if destiny worsens
 is tantra main mitra kii prapti se kitna sukh evam anandaprapt hota he vah kapotraj chitragriv kii katha ke madhyam se bataaya gaya he
 Only friend helps in disaster- aisa kaha gaya he ki mitra kaa ghar main aana swarg se bhi adhik sukh ko detaa he
 Thus, the precept of this system is that only useful friends should be made, as the crow, turtle, deer and rat remain happy on the strength of friendship
 isamen yuddh or sandhi kaa varnan karte hue ulluon kii guha ko kauon dwaara jala dene kii katha kahi gayi he
 It states that for self-realization, the enemy should also be made a friend and later be seen and destroyed
 is tantra main bhi kaua ullu se mitrataa kar letaa he or baad main ullu ke kile main aag lagava detaa he
 Therefore, you should stay safe from enemies because a person who falls in laziness and ignores enemies and disease - does not try to stop him, he is killed by the same - is tantra main vanar or magaramchh kii mukhya katha he or anya avaantar kathaayen hai
 It has been told in these stories that how was the achievement of the desired, that is, that it was destroyed
 isamen vanar or magaramchh kii katha ke madhyam se shiksha di gai he ki budhimaan apane buddhible se jeet jaataa he or murkh haath main ai hui vastu se bhi vanchit rah jaataa he
 Particularly in this last system of Panchatantra, emphasis has been laid on the policy of doing well thought out work because a person who does a work without thinking well and listening well does not get success in the work but many difficulties in life Have to face
 atah andhanukaran nahin karnaa chahie
 In the main story of this system, there is a story of a blindfolded hairdresser who was executed by the judges on the guilt of slaying the Jain-sannyas, following the Seth named Manibhadra
 atah bina pariksha kiye hue nai ke samaan anuchit kaary nahin karnaa chahie- It also states that no action should be done even without full knowledge because later one has to repent as if a Brahmin wife killed a blood-soaked mongoose without looking at it thinking that it had eaten my son
 So to protect the child from the snake, the snake was killed, due to which its face was stained with blood
 isliye kaha gaya- Thus, Panchatantra is a didactic work
 isamen lekhakane apni vyavhaar kushalta rajnatikpatutaa evam gyaan kaa parichay diya he
 Non-human characters of ethics are often of two types, living beings and unconscious matter
 panchatantra main bhi ye do prakaar ke paatr dekhe jate hai- pashuon main singh, vyaghr, shrigal, shashak, vrishabh, gadhaa, aadi, pakshiyon main kaak, uluk, kapot, mayur, chatak, shuk aadi tathaa itar praaniyon main sarp, nakul, pipilika aadi
 Apart from these, the river, sea, tree, mountain, cavity etc
 are also unconscious characters, which have been accused of human behavior
 panchatantra main maanav ko vyavhaar kushal banane kaa prayaas atyadhik saral evam rochak style main kiya gaya he
 Explaining the purpose of Panchatantra, Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has written that- di bears diamond ovel kimbrali, dakshin africa main ek bahuuddeshy stadium he
 It is currently used mostly for cricket matches and has hosted three matches during the 2003 Cricket World Cup
 stadium main 11,000 logon kii kshamta he
 The time of 100 years is called Shatabdi

 The plot of this poem is very simple
 raja chintamani ke putr yuvaraj kandarpaketu ne swapn main ek ati sundar yuvati ko dekha or uske soundarya se itnaa aakrisht hua ki rajkumaari ko foundne ke liye apni rajdhani se chal padaa
 He reached Vindhya region with his friend Makarand
 raatri main usne ek shuk-dampatti ke vaartalap ko suna or use gyaat hua ki uske swapn kii rajkumaari patliputra ke raja shringaar-shekhar kii putree vaasavadatta he or vah bhi usase prem karti he or usee ko dhudhane ke liye usne tamalika naam kii maina ko bheja he
 Both lovers-lovers from the bird met in Pataliputra
 chunki vaasavadatta ke pita ne uskaa vivaah kisi vidyadhar se nishchit kar rakhaa tha, isliye donon ne agyaat palaayan kaa nishchay kiya
 Arrived in Vindhyaparvat with an elusive horse
 kandarpaketu abhi so hi rahaa tha ki vaasavadatta bhraman ke liye van main gai jahaan kiraaton ke do ganon ne uskaa peechha kiya
 The two quarreled with each other to obtain the status of the caste
 vaasavadatta bhaag nikali or use ek ashram ke bich se nikalnaa padaa jahaan sanyasine use shaap diya or vah pathar main parivartit ho gai
 Disappointed Kandarpaketu tried to commit suicide but a sky-sound made it stop
 ant main vah ashram main pahunchaa or uske sparsh se rajkumaari punah jivit ho uthe
 Although the plot is very short, it is an autobiographical work of the author

 Talking birds, magic horses, renunciate curses and Akashwanias, etc
, have been proposed by the author, which is commonly found in Indian folk literature
 lekhak kaa uddeshy apni alankaar-pratibha kaa pradarshan karnaa tha na ki upanyaas likhane kii shakti kaa
 As Dr
 Sushil Kumar De says: The interestingness of the story is not the portrayal of the personal beauty of the lovers, but their generous kindness, mutual restraint affection, obstinate misfortune of desire, pain of fragmented love, and even in all the trials and hardships
 Even love is in safety
 vaasavadatta sanskrit kavyashastriyon se abhihit gaudi style main likhi gai he
 Character of Gaudi Vishwanath has given "script word plan, use of harsh sound words and a multiplicity of plurality" in literature
 subandhu ne apni rachana ko kai sahityak alankaaron se vibhooshit kiya he jinamein se shlesh pradhan hai
 Subandhu himself says that his poetry: vastutah shlesh ko prastut karne kaa uddeshy vakrokti kii shobhaa badhanaa he
 For example, while describing the beauty of a young woman, Subandhu says: arthath vaanron kii sena ke samaan sugriv or angad se sushobhit thi
