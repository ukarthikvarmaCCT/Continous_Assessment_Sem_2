 pakshiyon kaa pravrajan yaa pakshiyon kaa pravaas pakshivigyaan kaa bahut mahatvapurn ang he
 Their migration is as regular and gradual as that of the seasons, and it has elicited curiosity and curiosity in humans since ages, even as the Red Indians have named their calendar months after the arrival of migrating birds
 chidiyon ke pravrajan ke vishay ke maanya pandit landsbaro tomson ne pravrajan kii vyakhya is prakaar kii he: Long ago, it was believed that as some mammals and mammals go into dormancy to avoid frost in the autumn, in the same way that ababil, calvinka and cuckoo also cool
 aisi dharna arestu ke samay se hi chali aa rahi thi
 The ability to move in birds has developed immensely due to the thermal power, wings and amazing power of flight
 yadhyapi anya praaniyon kii apeksha pakshi atyadhik sheet yaa atyadhik ushnata donon ke prati sahansheel hote hai, tathaapi sharad ritu main jab bhojan kaa abhaav ho jaataa he tab unhen baadhya hokar pravrajan karnaa padataa he, anyathaa ve mar jaaen
 Through migration, sparrows also get two favorable areas in two adverse seasons
 ek kshetra main ve nivas karti hai or prajnan karti he or duusare kshetra main bhojan tathaa vishram ke hetu jaati hai
 It is a law of nature that birds lay eggs only in the cold part of the migration zone
 atev uttari golardh main unka mathunakshetra arctic uttari dhruv athwa samshitoshna kshetra hota he, kintu dakshini golardh main iske thik vipareet, sheetakaaleen awaas bumadhya rekha ke sameep hota he
 Often the migration is from north to south, although some migration is also from east to west
 pravrajan kuch kilometre se lekar hajaaron kilometre tak kaa hota he, jaise kuch chidiyaan himalay kii adhik oonchaai se utarkar uttari bharat ke samtal bhaagon main chali aati hai or kuch hajaaron kilometre sudur dakshin main chali jaati hai
 The most distant migration is done by the North Polar Kurri
 yah pravrajan prayek varsh do baar hota he
 It travels southward during the winter of the Arctic, crossing the world and returning to the South Pole Antarctic after spending the summer
 is prakaar jane or aane kii ek ore kii yatra main lagbhag 17,742 kilometre kii duuri tay karti he
 Several theories have been proposed regarding the onset of migration in sparrows
 pravrajan se chidiyon ko nimnlikhit laabh hote hai : The migration of sparrows depends on both internal and external stimuli of the bird
 prayogon se prakat hota he ki bahya uttejnaaon main se din kii avadhi main parivartan pramukh he ; ant : uttejnaa prajnanaangon se utpann hormone dwaara praapt hoti he
 Many experiments and observations of how the target destination of migration is determined and how the birds find their way to this destination have not yet received a satisfactory answer
 sharatkaleen awasakshetra main sharad ritu bitaane ke pashchaat vasant ritu main prajnan kshetra athwa greeshm-awaas-kshetra main vayask naron kaa pratham punaragaman hota he
 This is followed by adult females and finally by the minor sparrows
 kintu sharad main yah kram ulat jaataa he
 First minor birds and females depart for the southern journey and later adult males
 dakshin kii yatra bade itaminaan se or sthaan sthaan par ruk rukkar hoti he
 Young children or teenagers, who are only a few months old, guide the convoy and adults follow them later
 yah kaise hota he? isaki anek vyakhyaayein kii gai hai
 The more accepted opinion among them is that due to the migration of many generations every year, birds have to create a special kind of neem according to the caste tradition, without any prior experience, at the right time, without any prior experience
 Migration of experience has also become an inborn quality
 pakshi sudur pradeshon ke raste kaa kis prakaar pataa lagaate hai? iske vishay main bhi anek anumaan hai jinamein se kuch prithvi ke chumbakatv ke prati sookshm samvedansheeltaa, sthalchihron kii drushti dwaara pahchaan ityadi hai
 But foreseeing, the determination of the distant destination and its path in yesterday's birds remains mysterious
 jis prakaar manushya sudur kii yatra kar phir apane ghar ko laut aata he, thik usee bhanti pakshi hajaaron kilometre kii yatra kar or sharad ritu kisi sudur sthaan main vyateet kar na keval apane greeshm-nivas-kshetra main hi pahunch jate hai, balki apane tyakt ghonsle main bhi pahunch jate hai
 It has been established by the method of ringing the birds that in Europe, the abbeel often reaches not only the same settlement, but the same house to which she left and went on a distant journey
 ababilein is yatra main 9,677 kilometre kii duuri tay karti hai
 The same thing is found in other real migrating birds
 anek varshon ke nirikshan ke falswaroop prakashit kuch gyaat tathyon se pataa chalata he ki chidiyaan na keval apane nivaskshetra or puraane need main hi pahunch jaati he, balki thik usee din lautakar aa jaati hai jis din ve pichley varsh main lautakar ai thim
 Therefore, when traveling for such a long time, it is even more amazing that the birds return to their nests at a certain time
 bharat ke vibhinn kshetron main sharad main aagaman karanevaale prayek sharadyatri pakshi kii sthiti bhinn hoti he
 Take for example any location, such as the Bhopal region of central India
 pakshiyon kii adhikansh jatiyaan, jo uttar yaa uttar pashchim seemaant pradeshon se sharad ritu main, sudur dakshin kii yaa lanka kii, us desh se hokar yatra karti hai, ve bhopal hokar jaati hai
 Some of these travelers are left behind and can be seen in Bhopal throughout the autumn
 inkaa ham vaastavik sharadyatri ke antargat vargeekaran kar sakate hai, kintu kuch keval sharad ritu ke aagaman par thode samay ke liye hi rahete hai or uske baad dikhaai nahin padate kyonki ve vahaan se or aage yatra ke liye prasthaan kar chuke hote hai
 They again appear in early summer, when they return to the north
 ye sharad or vasant main pravrajan karanevaale yatri hote hai
 Some are visible in the autumn, when traveling south, but not visible when they return to their residence again in the spring, because they return via another route
 
 atev ve pakshi bhopal main sharad ritu main dikhaai padate hai or vasant main kisi duusare bhaag main dikhaai padate hai
 Some sparrows migrate from one part to another within the country itself, such as Shah Bulbul or Dudhanju, Golden Polak and Naurang
 yah sthaneey pravrajan desh ke uttari bhaag yaa pahaado kii talahati main adhik hota he, jahaan bumadhyarekha kii apeksha rituparivartan atyadhik prabhavakaari hota he
 Like real migrating birds, these also have a gradual and regular migration
 desh ke kisi bhaag main koi jati greeshm ritu main, koi jati barsaat main or koi jati sharad main aagaman karti he
 Apart from this, there is another type of translocation which happens due to local conditions affecting the diet, such as heat, drought or flood, etc
, or a particular type of flowering and ripening season
 us samay chidiyaan ek kshetra se duusare kshetra main chali jaati hai
 Sometimes sparrows are also found traveling to other areas in search of food, leaving them in their proper habitat, bound by extraordinary circumstances
 atev kisi kshetra main kisi bhi samay main pakshiyon kii jansankhya sthaayee nahin rahati, kyonki sabhi kshetron main pakshiyon kaa aagaman or niryaman sarvada hota rahata he
 The birds living in the high mountains of the Himalayas come down in winter and thus come down from the stormy weather and the Himalayas
 vasant ke aagaman par jab baraf galane lagati he or himrekha upar kii ore bad jaati he, tab ve andey dene ke liye pahaado ke upree bhaag main pun: chadh jaati hai
 This sequence continues not only in birds living in height, but also in birds living below
 chidiyon ke pravrajan kaa vaigyanik gyaan praapt karne ke atirikt prakaar ke avlokanon ke liye bhi britain tathaa america main bahusankhyak chidiyon ke pair main aluminium kii halki or ankit anguuthiyaan pahana di jaati he
 This method is called partisanship or partisanship in the United States
 isamen kramsankhya ke atirikt sthaan kaa pataa bhi ankit rahata he
 The sparrows are put on a ring and their full details are written and left in a booklet
 ab in chidiyon ke sudur sthanon pahunchne par inhen markar athwa phasaakar inaki anguthi utaar lee jaati he or ye jis sthaan se udi thim, us pate par bhej di jaati he
 When a large number of such types of tables are assembled, then these tables are analyzed and based on them, the path of migration of a particular species of bird or any other problem is determined
 atev pashchimi germany or purvi prasha main shwet bak ke balayan ke falswaroop yah nishchit or ni:sandigdh rup se sthapit ho chukaa he ki purvi asia kii chidiyaan dakshin-purvi maarg se balkan hoti hui africa kaa bhraman karti he, jabaki pashchim germany ke shwet bak dakshin pashchimi maarg se spain hokar africa jate hai
 We have come to know from the receipt of similar ringed sparrows in Bikaner that some white bucks that come to our country, in the autumn, are from Germany
 bharat main is prakaar kaa pakshivalayan kaa kaary bahut thodaa hua he
 But the information received from everything that has happened has proved very important and useful
 pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon kii gati vibhinn chidiyon main vibhinn hoti he or yah gati kai baton, jaise vaayu kii disha, mausam ityadi par nirbhar karti he
 Ducks and geese have been found to have a flight speed of 64 to 80 kilometers per hour and 90 to 97 kilometers or more in favorable weather
 din raat nirantar udakar yatra karanevaali chidiyon main yah gati 9
5 se 17
7 kilometre prati ghanta hoti he
 From the following table it can be estimated which distance a bird travels in a single flight: purvi sunaharaa tittibh bina kahin ruke lagaataar udakar 3226
00 kilometre ke khule samudr ko paar kar jaataa he
 These Tittibhas visit India in the autumn
 yah pashchimi alaska or uttar-purv siberia main andey detaa he or hawaii dwipon kaa niyamit rup se bhraman karata he
 The female who wished to lay eggs only in Japan, spends the winter in eastern Australia and Tazmania, thus must fly a distance of 4839
00 kilometers without stopping uninterruptedly
 kuch or bhi aisi chidiyaan he, jo bina dana pani ke bahut badi duuri paar jaati hai
 Among the Indian birds traveling far and wide, perhaps the Bhandu pheasant is the closest place to lay eggs in the Himalayas
 kuch jhandu teetar jaada nilgiri athwa dakshin kii anya pahadiyon main bitaate hai or uske bich anya kahin nahin milte
 This is so clear that they must cross at least 2419
5 kilometers in one flight
 pehle aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki pravrajan karanevaali chidiyaan bahut oonchaai par udati hai, kyonki isse unako, sthaan kaa nirdhaaran karne, hawa ke dwaara utpann avrodh kam hone, ityadi kaa laabh hota he
 But now it has been found that these migratory birds fly at an altitude of 396

 There are no specific principles of Giriyudha
 isamen bhi yuddh kaa uddeshy shatru ke mukhya sthanon par adhikaar karnaa tathaa uski shakti evam saamagree ko samul nasht karnaa he
 Whether this war is against treason in the mountainous region, as it did with the tribes in the northwest frontier of India during the British rule, or the war against organized armies, its skills and principles are of the same type
 pahaado main senaaon kii gatividhi or khaadya saamagree ko le jane main kathinaayee hoti he
 This difficulty arises not only from the encroaching altitude, the dense forested terrain, the snow and the river drains, but also the sudden seasonal changes and severe thunderstorms
 pahari kshetron main yatayaat ke saadhan bahut kam hote hai
 There are roads somewhere in the valleys, which are often rough and have obstructions due to melting of snow and rain
 isiilie is kshetra main sainikon ko vishesh saamagree or vishesh prakaar ke shastron kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 The fighting armies in this area must be self-sufficient in every way, because it is difficult to keep in touch with the rear forces at all times
 khaadya saamagree, baari shastron tathaa gola barood aadi saamagree dhone ke liye khachcharon or kuliyon kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 Arms of war are also those whose transfer is not easy
 paidal sena ko is prakaar sangathit kiya jaataa he ki ek company apni batalian se kaaphi samay tak pruthak rah sake
 This company should always be ready to carry its machine guns, shells, gunpowder, weapons, rations etc
 on the mules and use it in war
 topein aisi honi chahie jo kholkar khachcharon par laadi ja saken
 Howitzer type guns are good and profitable in this area
 pahari kshetra main sadakon ke na hone ke kaaran ghudsavaar senaaon kaa upyog kam hota he, parantu katipay udhaaharan aise bhi uplabdh hai, jinamein pahari kshetron main ghudsavaar laabhadaayak siddh hue
 Engineers should have enough material to build bridges and renovate roads
 yah saamagree aisi honi chahie jo khachcharon par saraltapurvak laadi ja sake
 Wireless set is the most important means of communication in the hilly region

 Installation of telephone lines in the hilly region is very difficult

 Army contingents in mountainous areas extend far apart

 They should be organized in small parts in such a way that each unit has medical care
 aahat tathaa rogiyon ko le jane ke liye doliyon kaa samuchit prabandh hona chahie
 Due to lack of sufficient land nearby, air instability and clouds for the landing of aircraft, a lot of work cannot be taken from the air force
 vayuyan dwaara shatruon kii chaukiyon tathaa yatayaat ke sadhano ke vishay main jaankaree praapt kii ja sakati he
 The use of tanks in mountain warfare has increased the importance of tanknastic weapons
 tinkon ke prayog ke liye raaston kii sankhya kam hone ke kaanan tenksnashi topon ke liye upyukt sthaan foondnaa saral hota he
 These tank cannons can be killed only a short distance away, because there is a blockage on the path of vision
 sankeern margon main sena dalon ko hawaii akraman se bachaana anivaary he
 Therefore, airborne cannons are placed on the narrow passages of the troops
 pahaado main yuddh kii yojana banane ke purv aisi bhugolic sthitiyon kaa bhalee bhanti gahan adhyayan karnaa chahie jo sena kii gatividhi par prabhaav daalen
 Maps of mountainous locations are often not completely accurate and do not satisfactorily describe the entire blockages
 jab bhi sambhav ho, us kshetra kii purnat: jaanch kar leni chahie, yadhyapi yah praaia: kathin hota he
 Photographs taken by aircraft can provide a lot of information about the area
 pahari yuddh apni or shatru kii gatividhi par nirbhar hota he
 Therefore knowledge of roads is important
 akramanon kaa prathamoddeshy sadak ko adhikaar main lenaa rahata he
 Early preparation for war is of particular importance due to the difficulties of activity
 ek baar senaaon ko kisi kaarivishesh par niyukt kar diya jaae to usamen phir adal badal karnaa praaia: kathin hota he
 In this too, changing the directions of the army creates great difficulty
 akraman kii pehali samasya sena kaa vibhaajan he
 War in the mountains is radiated over a very long area
 isliye yah anivaary he ki sainikon ko ghaatiyon ke anusaar baanta jaay or unka anushaasan bhi pruthak pruthak kar diya jaay
 The number of soldiers in each valley is determined based on the land
 jaise jaise sena ghaatiyon ke nichle bhaagon se aage badhati he vaise vaise donon ore kii chotiyon par adhikaar hona chahie
 The party which has the right over the peaks, the same party has the right over the valleys
 kai pahaado kii chotiyon par pathaar paae jate hai
 Armies can be spread over them
 shatru kaa saamana praaia: sankeern margon par hota he, kyonki prayek kushagra evam doordarshee shatru aise hi kantakakirn sthanon par apni suraksha kii vyavastha karata he
 One has to consider whether the enemy should be attacked from such a place from the hill side or from the valley side; Because the party who has the right over the high land also owns the lower land and the passes
 isaliye aise sthanon par yah satat praytn hona chahie ki darroke aasapaas kii unchi bhoomi par aarambh main hi adhikaar kar liya jaae
 For the success of the attack, it is necessary that the enemy be deceived
 akraman aksmaat hona chahie or shatru ko yah maaloom nahin hone dena chahie ki akraman kis sthaan par hoga
 An attack from an uncertain direction and an indefinite time leads to disturbances in the enemy's defense
 falat: safalataa kii aashaa adhik hoti he
 There are many examples in which the war was successful by using such difficult routes in the hilly region which were not considered worthy of traffic
 1940 isvi main german senaaon ne norway ke yuddh main ek aise maarg kaa upyog kiya jisase norwevaalon ko unke aane kii aashaa na thi or is kootneeti se german sugamawapurvak vijayi hue
 The attack in Giriyudh is often a form of small skirmishes
 shatru ko ekbar parajeet karne ke pashchaat acha hota he ki uskaa peechha karke palayit kar diya jaae jisase vah kahin bhi aashwast na ho sake
 One difficulty often encountered in Giriyudh is that it is unable to cooperate in simultaneous attacks on two or more places
 pahari kshetra kii oobadkhabad bhoomi aatmaraksha ke liye atyuttam hoti he, parantu bachaav main gaharaai nahin di ja sakati
 The main objective of rescue is to prevent the roads of the valleys from going under enemy's authority
 sadakon ke bachaav ke liye aisa sthaan chunanaa chahie jahaan prakritik rachana tathaa bhoomi kii akruti bachaav main sahaayta kare
 For example, such high places should be chosen from where the enemy does not find another path to move forward
 yah baat bhi dhyaan main rakhni chahie ki shatru ke aage badhane ke anya margon par bhi goli kii maar kii ja sake
 Empowering the peaks of high places or mountains should not be the end of the objective, but it is also necessary to see that the valley can be fully guarded from those peaks
 yadi in unche sthanon se neeche ke margon kii dekhbhaal nahin kii ja sakati to kai avasaron par neeche kii dhaalon par aise sthaan foundne padate hai jahaan se puri dekhbhaal kii ja sake
 Less troops are needed to defend the rugged terrain, but sufficiently well-guarded forces must be kept close so that the attack can be swiftly attacked and the enemy defeated
 yadi bachaav ke liye morche pahaad ke saamne kii dhaal par banaae jaayan to unase dekhbhaal acchhee kii ja sakati he or shatru ke akraman ko oonchaai kii ore badhane se pehle hi roka ja saktaa he
 But the disadvantage in this is that such fronts remain in the eyes of the enemy
 unpar shatru goli kii maar kar saktaa he
 If the front is built on the top of the mountain, then there are many places on the lower slopes which are protected from care and shot
 is avasthaa main shatru sugamawa se oonchaai kii ore bad saktaa he shikhar par banaae hue morcho kaa laabh yah hota he ki ve shatru kii sidhi maar ke bheetar nahin aate or sahaayak sena ko acha chhipav mil jaataa he
 If the fronts are built on the back of the mountain, there can be a considerable defense against enemy fire, but it becomes difficult to control and observe the shields in front of these fronts and the routes of the valley below
 bachaav ko sudrudh karne ke liye morchon ke aage kantedaar taar or surange lagaai jaati hai
 Many types of obstacles can also be placed on the path of the enemy moving forward, such as blowing the bridge of river drains with gunpowder etc
 bachaav main tenksnashi topein or doosraa topakhana aise sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he jahaan se vah jis bhubhag se akraman kii ashanka ho us ore maar kar sake
 Aircraft artillery should be mounted at high altitude so that it can take care and kill all around

 Autumn war in the mountainous region is very difficult in the autumn

 Apart from this, special kind of war material has to be arranged for these soldiers
 asangathit senaaon se yuddh-kai baar senaaon ko pahari kshetra main rajdrohiyon kii asangathit senaaon se yuddh karnaa padataa he
 Like the war with the Naga people in the north-eastern frontier of India
 ye avyavasthit kshetreey sainik yudhkala main bade praveen evam anbhavi hai
 They do not make any special arrangements for the war material, that is why they are often in motion and raid and fight

 Jaswant Rai orders Jumman to tell the teenager about it
 kishori, karan par aarope lagaati he ki usne use dhokhaa diya he or jhootha prem dikhaaya he
 Karan responds that the teenager whose lie is with his father in jail has no right to call anyone else a liar
 The truly knowledgeable teenager regrets it and gives a letter to Karan

 germany ke nihilist darshanik maiks starnar ko araajaktaavaadi vyaktvaad kaa pramukh chintak mana jaataa he
 According to this view, the person and his sovereignty should remain completely inviolable
 starnar kehete hai ki vyakti ko ishwar, rajya yaa kisi bhi naitikta kii parvaah kiye bina apni marzi se pahalakadami le kar sakriy rahane kaa adhikaar diya janaa anivaary he
 While this type of anarchists advocate for social relations through transactions and compromises, the practicality of their program is reduced considerably due to wildly and egoistic advocates of individual privacy
 unnisvin sadi main america araajaktaavaadi josaiya warren ne is tarah ke araajaktaavaad ke aarthik bandobast kaa ek khaakaa pesh karne kii koshish kii
 He established 'time Stores' stocking hours of hard work
 unki tajaviz thi ki shram kii mudra ke zariye logon ke bich samtamulak vaanijya ho saktaa he
 American anarchists strongly criticized the market-based economy
 unhone, visheshkar layasender spunar ne america samvidhan par jabardast akraman karte hue us samjhautaparak siddhant kii kaamiyon ko dikhaaya jise rajya kii sanstha kaa aadhaar mana jaataa he
 The inspirations of individualist anarchism can be traced to the idea of libertarianism that flourished in the twentieth century
 samuhiktavaadi araajaktaavaad ke pramukh chintak bakunin maane jate hai
 The collectivists neither liked the favor of the small farmers and artisans practiced by the Prudhs nor were they supportive of the socialist idea promoted by Karl Marx
 marks ke communism ko adhinayakawadi qaraar dene vaala yah vichaar ek aise bhavishya kii kalpana karata he jisamen mazdoor sangathit ho kar poonji ko apane haath main le lenge
 The means of production will remain in the hands of organized workers
 samuhik faisale ke aadhaar par aamadani kaa vitaran hoga
 The amount of labor that one does, the larger the share
 parasparatavaadi araajaktaavaad vyaktvaad or samuhiktawaad bich rasta tha jiske sutrikaran kaa shrey prudhon ko jaataa he
 The Prudhs, while harmonizing between property and communism, advocated an economic system under which a person would have the right to own his own means of production, privately or collectively, but he would get the same according to his labor so that in society Equality can be maintained
 is arthvyavastha main vinimay is naitik mulya par aadhaarit tha ki vyakti keval utana hi maangega jitna vah swayan dene ke liye taiyaar ho
 Prudhs also proposed the establishment of banks offering loans to producers at a minimum interest rate
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki prudhon ke aarthik prayog kaamyaab nahin hue, par unke francisi anuyaayiyon ne pehle communist international kii shuruyaat par apana prabhaav choda
 Later he was pushed aside by the collectivists
 samyavaadee araajaktaavaad yah maan kar chalata he ki communism kii sthapana ke liye rajya kii sanstha anaavashyak he
 Prince Kropatkin was the principal philosopher of this stream
 unka kahana tha ki manushya paraspar ekta or sahyog ke naiysargik gunon sampann he jinke prabhaav main sampatti sambandhi vibhed apane-aap khatm hote chale jaayenge
 Every person in the society will use the resources involved
 mazaduron kii swayamsevi associeshne aapurti sambandhi zaruuraton ke hisaab se utpaadan-prakriya kaa niyojan karengi
 The commune will identify the requirements of its members, which will determine the demand
 communon kaa aapasi mahasang hoga jo sadaken banane, railway pranali or anya sampark-sanchaar kii suvidhaon kii fikr karegaa
 People will not need material incentives to work
 nijee sampatti kii gair-maujuudagi ke tahat samaaj main aparaadhiyon se nibatane ke liye anaupchaarik taur-tareeke apanaaye jaayenge or kanoon kii damankaaree mashinari kii jarurat nahin padegi
 The communist anarchists thought that the collectivist approach could be adopted until human unity based on personal property could be eliminated
 unnisvin shatabdi kaa bauddhik-raajnneetik itihaas marxvaadiyon or araajaktaavaadiyon ke bich bahes se bharaa hua he
 Anarchists wanted that the institution of the state should be immediately recommended, but the Marxists, despite being in favor of ending the state, first wanted to establish a workers' state
 araajaktaavaadiyon kaa kahana tha ki sarvhaara kaa rajya bhi kul mila kar vishmata or utpeedan kaa madhyam ban jayega
 Bakunin used to call the socialist state a military barrack in which people would sleep, wake up and labor at the sound of drums
 yah ek aisa rajya hoga jisamen chaalaak or shikshit log sarkari suvidhaayen bhogenge
 Through the poverty of his creation philosophy in 1846, Marx severely criticized Prudh
 pratham communist international main jab bakuninapanthiyon ne prudhon ke anuyaayiyon ko parajeet kar diya to unhen marks ke anuyaayiyon se loha lenaa padaa
 International conflict broke out in 1872 as a result of this conflict
 rajya kii sanstha kii mukhaalafat karne ke kaaran araajaktaavaadi kisi bhi tarah ke sansadeey vichaar ke bhi kilaaf rahete hai
 They do not participate in elections
 samaaj ke krantikari roopantaran main vishwaas ke kaaran zyaadaatar araajaktaavaadi sabhi tarah ke praadhikaar or aarthik sansthaaon ke kilaaf jan-vidroh kii apil karne kaa kaarykram pesh karte hai
 Since there is no scope for any major authority in his plan, he advocates spontaneous and local strategy of small rebellions
 samyavaadee araajaktaavaad ne unnisvin sadi ke aakiri saalon main vyaktigat str par aatankwaadi karravaayiyon kii muhim bhi chalaai jiske tahat rajanetaaon or pramukh udyogpatiyon kii hatyaayein bhi kii gayin
 Anarchists were quite active in Spain, Italy, Belgium and France in the nineteenth century
 america main 1905 main frans ke anarko-sindiclizam se prerit tered union andolan bhi chalaa
 In the sixties and seventies in the twentieth century, anarchist thought's credibility in intellectual circles showed increasing
 paul gurmen or danniel guirin ne shiksha or saamudayikta ke kshetra main araajaktaavaadi hastkshep kiye
 Nowadays anarchist theory has no visible effect
 lekin, is sarvasattawad, adhinayakawad or nirankushta ke aalochakon ke tarkon main is siddhant kii aahaten suni ja saktin hai
 Anarchism is always present in one form or another in the socialist thought tradition
 udaarataavaadiyon ko abhivyakti kii azaadi se sambandhit apane dhulamulapan se mukt karne main bhi araajaktaavaad kii bhoomika se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Inspiration for this idea has also been in the urge for freedom from all forms of violence under pacifism
 swatantraavaad ke vichaar par to araajaktaavaad kii chhap spasht he hi, paryaavaranvaadi andolan ne bhi apane kai aagrah usase praapt kiye hai
 The Tutpunjia bourgeois socio-political stream which is the enemy of all power and state holds the interests of small private ownership and small farmer economy against the progress of a large scale production based society
 adhikansh araajaktaavaadi nijee swaamitv ko samaapt karnaa chaahate hai or uski jagah samast sampatti par saamudayik swaamitv sthapit karne kaa samarthan karte hai
 In principle, anarchism is primarily treated as idealistic utopia and objective communism
 utapian araajaktaavaad kii neenv he vyaktvaad, aatmavaad tathaa sankalpwaad
 The names of Schmidt, Prundo and Bakunin are notable among the prominent directors of this branch
 yah siddhant 19 veen sadi ke dauraan france, italy tathaa spain main vyapak rup main prachlit tha
 He proclaims the tools against moral exploitation like moral strength and change of heart
 kinchit arthon main gandhi bhi isi varg ke vichaarkon main maane jate hai
 Communist anarchism, propounded by marx-engels, explores the physical causes of exploitation beyond the utopian idealistic tactics against exploitation and the scientific rendering of the understanding of class struggle as the driving force to make socialist revolution possible
 sarvhaara varg dwaara raajnneetik satta ko jeetne kii aavashyaktaa kii araajaktaavaadiyon dwaara asweekruti mazdoor varg ko burjua raajnneeti ke maatahat rakhane kaa vastuparak dhang se hitsaadhan karti he
 Communist anarchism demands immediate elimination of the state
 vah kranti ke liye sarvhaara varg ko taiyaar karne ke liye burjua rajya kii sansthaaon ke upyog kii sambhaavnaaon ko sweekaar nahin karte tathaa samaaj ke samaajawaadee punarnirmaan main rajya kii bhoomika se inkaar karte hai

 It wants to understand politics on the lines of natural sciences
 vyavahaaravaadi vidwaanon ne raajnneeti ko ek pranali ke rup main dekha or gunatmak ke bajaay maatraatmak vishleshan par jor de kar use ek vishuddh vigyaan banane kii koshish kii
 According to the American scientist, nothing did voyeurism america raajnneeti-vigyaan main beesvin sadi ke duusare dashak se hi raajnneetik saidhaantiki ko adhikadhik vigyansammat banane ke rujhaan paidaa hone lage the
 Under the leadership of Charles Merriam, considered to be the father of political science, attempts had been made to make this study based on the scientific study of political behavior, along with the historical study of political thought
 iskaa makasad tha raajnneeti-vigyaan ko vyaavhaarik raajnneetik lakshyon kii seva main lagaana
 These concerns of Merriam slowed down due to the economic-political crisis that came in the thirties and forties, but they once again emerged in the fifties
 ise raajnneeti-vigyaan main vyavahaaravaadi kranti kii sangya di gayi jisase is anushaasan ke bhavishya ko gahraayi se prabhavit kiya

 is daur main sheet-yuddh apane charam par tha jiske prabhaav main raajnneeti ko ek nishchit mulya-pranali kii drushti se dekhne vaale agrahon kaa avamulyan hua
 American scholars decided to make political science a pure science rather than a means of civic education and political reforms
 unke is sankalp ke peeche tarkparak pratyakshvaad tha jiskaa janm indrianubhavad ke garbh se hua tha
 In the fifties and sixties after the Second World War, the new generation of sociologists considered it appropriate to emphasize the 'study of facts' rather than considering the power and authority of formal institutions or looking at the history of political ideas to make sense of politics
 
 iske tahat aagrah kiya gaya ki raajnneeti kaa vigyansammat adhyayan tabhi sambhav he jab kisi bhi tarah ke nitigat, nijee yaa aasthaagat rujhaan se saafe bachate hue sirf tathyon or aankadon ke dam par raajnneeti or samaaj ko samajhane ke model banaaye jaaen
 Instead of formal institutions, the behavior of voters, interest groups, political parties and other political actors should be highlighted
 isi ke saath aupchaarik padon par baithe vidhikrttaaon, adhikariyon or nyaayadhishon vagairah ke taur-tareekon kii jaanch kii jaae
 This pragmatic sociology completely rejected the usefulness of political philosophy and avoided all normative questions and discussions
 yah drushti bahut kuch prakritik vigyaanon se lee gayi thi
 Under this scheme, emphasis was placed on Imperial analysis method and research instead of nominal
 raajnneetik vyavhaar or raajnneetik prakriyaaon ke tathyaparak adhyayan or vivechan ko tarjeeh di gayi, surveykshan-takneekein apanaayi jane lageen, raajnneetik tantron ko modelon ke rup main samajhane kaa silsilaa shuru hua or chunaav aadi ke aankadon ke vishleshan ke madhyam se raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa sutrikaran kiya jane laga
 This intervention of behaviorism completely changed the agenda of research in political science
 america sansthaanon ne bhi is tarah ke anusandhan main jam kar sansadhano kaa nivesh kiya or sari duniya main raajnneeti ko samajhane ke liye vyavahaaravaadi shodh kii dhooma much gayi
 Interestingly, in the days when pragmatism was dominating, its criticism was also flourishing in social science
 tees ke dashak se hi america main germany se aise vidwaanon ke aane kaa taanta laga hua tha jo samaaj-vigyaan ko apane maanakeey sarokaaron se alag karke vastunishth vigyaan banane ke paksh main nahin the
 Prominent among these were levi-stross, Eric Wojlin, Hanna Arent, Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marquez
 vampanthi hon yaa dakshinpanthi, vidvatta ke kshetra main in vidwaanon ne us america ravaiye se asahmati vyakt kii jo vaigyaniktaa, udaarataavaad or aitihaasik pragati ke paksh main atyadhik jhukaa hua tha
 These people refuted the pragmatists' claim that the era of political theology developed on normative basis is now passing
 stros ne kaha ki raajnneeti ko nayaa vigyaan banane kii koshishon main nihit pratyakshvaadi ravaiyon ke kaaran raajnneeti kii behatar samaj bananaa naammumkin hota ja rahaa he
 Throughout the fifties, debate erupted between behaviorism and its critics, making political theory central
 isi ke parinamswaroop saath ke dashak main raajnneetik siddhant kii duniya teen shreniyon main bant gayi
 In a category, there were those theorists whose priority was to study and meditate on the history of political thought
 duusari shrenee maanakeey raajnneetik siddhant kii or teesri shrenee raajnneetik ke tathyaatmak anubhavsiddh gyaan par aadhaarit thi
 The major signatures of the third category were David Easton, Carl Deutsche and Robert Dahl, who created models and general principles by analyzing the facts of a region
 saath ke dashak ke ant main vyavahaarwadiyon ko kai kshetron se aalochana ke naye daur kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The requests to make the study of politics a pure science were alleged that they did not develop an understanding of many social and political issues of that period
 is aalochana kii roshni main easton ne vyavahaarwad main sanshodhan tajaviz kiya or use ‘post-bihavioral revolution’ kii sangya di
 This revised image of behaviorism continued to develop in the seventies and eighties under which social and value obligations of political science along with scientific method and technology were taken care of
 sattar ke dashak main hi tarkparak pratyakshvaad kii aalochanaayen saamne aayin jinhone samaaj-vigyaan ke darshan ko prabhavit kiya
 This was the period in which the works of Yurgan Habermas, Robert Nozick and John Rawls were published, based on the exercise of normative political theory rather than pragmatism
 bhartiya samaaj-vigyaan par bhi saath or sattar ke dashak main is pravriti kaa asar padaa
 In this period, scholars of the Developmental Society Studies Chair attempted to create a model free from ideological trends to understand Indian politics under the leadership of Rajni Kothari
 lekin jaldi hi saafe ho gaya ki kothaari ke is model main imperical agrahon ke saath-saath tathyon ke moolyankan ke liye samaaj-vigyaan ke maanakeey ayaamon kaa bhi sahaara liya gaya he
 The term Hindi pragmatism serves two terms of sociology, Behaviorism and Behaviorism

 The by-election was necessitated as during a 'sting operation', the member of the Legislative Assembly of the Legislative Assembly - Mr

 According to the party's campaigning, in this way this area would become an industrial area which would open the doors for more investment and jobs in the state
 However, the main opposition party - Trinamool Congress) says that in reality it is not against industrialization, rather it is being released in inhuman ways

 Related Census Code: State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00718 kathini yaa crusteshia jeevajgat main sandhipad jeevon kaa ek mukhya vibhaag he, jisamen bade kekad, jhinge, chingt, prachingt, mahachingt, khandavar, kashtha euka tathaa jalpinshu ityadi hai, parantu iske sabase chote jeevon ko dekhne ke liye anuvikshan yantra kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 There is a huge difference in the type of difficulty of different castes, due to which it is very difficult to give a brief definition
 kathini kaa prayek lakshan, visheshkar iske parashrayi tathaa ucch vishesh jeevon main to, purna rup se kisi na kisi prakaar badal jaataa he
 The term crustacea has been used initially for those creatures whose armor is rigid and ductile
 iske vipareet duusare jeev ve hai jinka kavach tathaa bhangur hota he, jaise sip tathaa ghonghe ityadi
 But now it is known that the external skeleton of all arthropods is hard and soft
 is kaaran ab kathini ko anya lakshanon ke pruthak kiya jaataa he
 The creatures of this class are mostly water dwellers and there is no such reservoir in the world where there is no caste found in them
 is kaaran kathini varg ke jeev praaia: jalashvasanika athwa twachaa se shwaas lete hai
 These include two pairs of horns in front of the mouth and three pairs behind the face of Hanu
 kathini varg ke mukhya parichit jeev to jhingen or kekade hai jinka upyog maanav apane khaadya rup main karata he, parantu inase kahin adhik aarthik mahatv ke iske nimna jeev anfipadz,, isopidz, ityadi, hai jo uthle jalaashyon main samoohon main rahete hue sammarjak kaa kaam karte hai
 The food of these lower creatures are the objects of other creatures and flora, as well as they themselves become the food of higher beings, such as fish etc
 iske kai talaplavi sookshm jeev aise bhi hai jinke samooh milon tak sagar ke rang ko badal dete hai, jisase machhuon ko uchit matsaysthanon kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 In this way, they provide economic benefits by becoming fish meal as well as helping the fishermen
 is varg ke jeevon kaa kavach duusare sandhipad jeevon ke samaan hi khandon ke samoohon main vibhajit rahata he, parantu inamen se praaia: kuch khand ekibhanjit bhi haate hai
 Each segment is similar to the armor ring, which is attached to the flexible integum with its front and back sections
 prayek khand kaa chaap sadrush prishthiya patt, sternam kehalaata he or turgam ke donon parshv bhaag, jo patton ke rup main rahete hai, plura kehalaate hai
 a pair of limbs are attached to the sternum of each segment
 sharir kaa antim khand, jisapar guda hoti he, angahin rahata he or telson kehalaata he
 In modern difficulty, no such organism is found in which each segment is clearly distinct from each other
 udaahranarth, jhinge ke sharir ke agrabhag kaa kavach avibhajit tathaa naalakaar hota he or kairapes kehalaata he
 The number of its segments is estimated by the number of components associated with this part
 is bhaag main sanyukt khandon kii sankhya kam se kam chah maani gai he jisamen naitrik khand bhi sammilit hai
 This part is called head
 jab is bhaag main isse adhik khand sammilit rahete hai tab iske badwaale khandon ke avyav agle avyavon se purnat: pruthak hote hai
 The back sections of the head are divided into two parts of the body, chest and abdomen, which are separated by their different components
 parantu ucch kathini mailaakanstraca ityadi main vaksh ke khand sir main sammilit ho jate hai
 Then this joint part is named as Shirsovaksha
 is prakaar kairapes kaa rup bhi bhinn-bhinn kathini jeevon main anek prakaar paaya jaataa he
 It completely covers the body and limbs in the form of bivalve shells in Branchiopoda and Ostracoda, in the cirrpedia it is a muscular cavity shaped and calcified bandage is also placed to reinforce it
 ye to iske kuch vishesh rup hai, parantu saadhaaran naalakaar rup ke kairapes main vaksh ke ek se lekar saare khand sir main sammilit ho sakate hai
 Carapace is found in almost all of the various difficulties
 keval anestroca hi jeev hai jinamein kairapes nahin hota
 The convergent extremity of a tough body is found in its parasitic and suspended organisms
 khandavar apni prachhdhavastha main apane sir se mulabaddha rahete hai or saath hi unamem radial samamiti kii ore pravriti hoti he jiskaa kaaran inkaa sthagit jivan he
 In parasitic organisms, the body segment has disappeared and the shape of the body has also changed completely
 iskaa udhaaharan rizosephala he, jisamen kathini ke lakshan to kya, sandhipad jeevon kaa bhi koi lakshan praudhavastha main nahin dikhaai detaa
 Difficult creatures are mainly forest dwellers
 is kaaran anumaan kiya jaataa he ki is varg ke purvaj kaa sharir samaan khandon main vibhajit tha or prayek khand par ek jodi ang jude the
 Each of their components used to do all the work together like circulation, food, respiration and knowledge
 trilobita main avyavon kii aisi hi vyavastha maani gai he, parantu yah upvarg lupt ho gaya he
 So far in the modern difficulty, no such organism has been found, whose ingredients are with these four functions
 iske sir ke ang to bhinn-bhinn vishesh kaaryon ke liye upyukt hote hai, parantu brankiopoda ke dhad ke avyav ek samaan hote hai or kuch seemaa tak mana ja saktaa he ki inase chaaron kaary hote hai
 Otherwise, the feature of limbs has advanced in difficulty by many measures, because it is known that the organs which do one task in some difficulty, do the other tasks in the other difficulty
 kathini ke bheetar kaa vikaas mukhyat: in angon ke hi kartavya main niyantran par aadhaarit he
 No matter how hard the components are used for any task and no matter how different in size, their composition is mainly bicameral
 prayek avyav kaa aadhaarit vrutt dwikhandi hota he or ise sympod yaa protopodit kehete hai or iske upree khand se do shakhaayen endopodit or exopotide nikalati hai
 This type of root based ingredient is called Steinopodium
 aise saadhaaran dwishakhi avyav kopipod ke plavan pad, mailocostraca ke udar ang ityadi hai or aise hi ang purvaj dimbh main bhi, jise nopleius kehete hai, paae jate hai
 Similar elements take different forms for special tasks in other difficult organisms
 kathini ke netra do prakaar ke hote hai madhyam tathaa sanyukt netra
 Very simple middle eye noplias and many adults live in hardships, but in malacostraca they disappear and the combined eye is the working eye
 sanyukt netra praaia: ek jodi hote hai, jo kuch jeevon ke avrunt or kai ek main vrintyukt rahete hai
 The eye is considered to be a component of the head, but it is suspicious
 kaaran, parivardhan main yah duusare angon main bahut pashchaat udit hote hai
 The first horns, which remain in front of the mouth, are considered components of the second section
 yah nopleius tathaa sab upjatiyon ke jeevon main, keval mailocostraca ke atirikt, ekasakhi hoti hai
 Their main function is sensor, but in many eggs and adult difficulties they also come in the function of flotation and many males also capture the female from the ring
 siropedia main cement grathiyon ke chhidr inhen avyavon par hote hai, jinaki sahaayta se inke vayask sthagit hote hai
 Although the second horn is located in front of the mouth, it was actually located behind the mouth
 nopleius main iskaa sthaan mukh ke parshv main rahata he or yah bhojan ko mukh kii ore laane main sahaayta detii he
 The rest of its work is similar to the first ring
 melacostraca main isaki ek shakha bahusandhimaan kashang ke aakaar kii hoti he or iskaa kaary keval samvedan grahan he, parantu duusari shakha kaa aakaar chapate patt ke samaan hota he or yah plavan main santolan kaa kaary bhi karti he
 In Noplius and Vyaska Kopipoda, Isopoda, etc
