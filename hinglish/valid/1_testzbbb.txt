 These are the permanent winds moving from subtropical high-pressure lanes to sub-polar low-pressure lanes
 inaki pashchami disha ke kaaran inhe 'pachhuva pawan' kehete hai
 Permanent winds flowing from subtropical high air pressure tropics towards subipolar low air pressure in both the Earth's hemispheres are called westerly winds due to their westward movement
 In the northern hemisphere, it flows from southwest to northeast and in the southern hemisphere from northwest to southeast
 The best development of the westward winds is found between 40 ° to 65 ° south latitudes, because of the vast expanse of the waters here, the speed of the winds is relatively fast and the direction is fixed
 Due to their intensity in the southern hemisphere, they 'scream chalis' between 40 and 50 degrees south latitude, 'prachanda Pachasa' in the adjacent areas of 50 degrees south latitude and 'screaming satha' near 60 degrees south latitude
 It is said that due to the huge land segment of uneven high pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and the changing seasonal pattern of air pressure, the flow of this wind from the general western direction is unclear
 The range of these winds towards the pole is very unstable, which changes according to the weather and other reasons

 The 'dakshin Kosala' of the Vedic and mythological period became "chhattisgarh" in the Middle Ages
 isvi san 1000 se 1500 kaa kaal madhya yug kehalaata he
 It was during this period that the region was named as 'chhattisgarh' because in the Middle Ages the forts, which were called 'durg' in the Vedic and mythological period, came to be called 'garh'
 garh shabd kaa prayog desh ke madhya bhaag main bahut adhik kiya jaataa tha
 'mandav Garh', 'sirsa Garh', 'garh Mahobe', 'garh Delhi' are mentioned in the book Alhkhand, composed by the then poet Jagnik
 garh shabd kaa arth khai yukt kila hota he kintu chhattisgarh main garh shabd kaa prayog kile ke atirikt rajya yaa jilon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa tha
 In other words, we can say that wherever the king used to build his capital, the word garh used to be used with that place
 aaj bhi chhattisgarh kii jameendaariyon ke sadar mukaamon main bhootpurv raajaaon ke sudrudh mahal or khai yukt kile dekhe ja sakate hai
 The extensive terrain around a citadel was called 'raj'
 aaj bhi chhattisgarh ke nivasee 'kharagarh raaj', 'raigarh raaj', 'raipur raaj', 'patan raaj' shabdon kaa prayog karte hai
 In this way, due to the group of thirty-six strongholds, the name of this region became Chhattisgarh
 yah jaanane ke liye ki samooh main chhattis hi garh kyon the hamen chhattisgarh ke itihaas ko tatolna padegaa
 In the tenth century, Tripuri was ruled by powerful Kalachuri kings
 inhen raajaaon kii ek shakha ne chhattisgarh ke ratanpur main apana rajya sthapit kiya
 The Kalachuri of Tripuri considered themselves Chandravanshi while the Kalachuri of Ratanpur considered the origin of their dynasty to the Sun
 donon kalchuri vanshon kaa sambandh mahishmati ke haihay sahatrarjun se tha
 For this reason, the king of Ratanpur and Raipur in Chhattisgarh is called Haihayavanshi
 kalchuri shaskaon kii tripuri shakha ke utkeern lekhon ke anusaar tripuri ke raja kokelldev ke atharah putr the
 The eldest son ruled in Tripuri and divided the remaining divisions of the kingdom among the remaining seventeen brothers
 is prakaar puraa rajya atharah bhaagon main bant gaya
 The state was called 'garh' in that region in that era
 idhar urisa main pehle se hi 'atharagarh' naam prachlit tha
 Probably due to the same effect, there were eighteen circles in the Haihaya dynasty, their group of states got the name 'athargarh'
 kalchuri vansh ke 'kalingraj' naamak raja ne dakshin purv kii ore apane rajya kaa vistaar kiya or bilaspur jile main sthit tumman ko apni rajdhani banaaya
 Ratnaraja, grandson of Kalingaraja, settled Ratanpur and made it his capital
 ratanpur ke haihay vanshi kanishtha rajkumaar 'raay ramachandra' ne shivnath ke dakshin main aakar raipur nagar basaaya or use apni rajdhani bana kar rajya karne lage
 According to the tradition of his dynasty, he also divided his kingdom into eighteen divisions
 is prakaar haihay vanshi raajaaon ke shivnath ke uttar main atharah or shivnath ke dakshin main atharah arthath chhattis garh ho gayi or yahi is kshetra kaa 'chhattisgarh' kahalaane kaa kaaran bana

 durgadas rathod bharat ke marwar kshetra ke rathod rajvansh ke ek mantri the
 He became the protector of Kunwar Ajit Singh after the death of Maharaja Jaswant Singh
 unhone mogul samraat aurangzeb ko bhi chunauti di or kai baar oranghazab ko yuddh main peeche hatane ore sandhi ke liye majaboor kiya or kai baar yuddh main haraaya
 Durgadas was the son of Asakaran Rathore, a minister of the Marwar ruler Maharaja Jaswant Singh
 unki maan apane pati or unki anya patniyon ke saath nahin raheen or jodhpur se dur raheen
 Hence Durgadas was raised in a village called Lunava
 inkaa janm salwa kalla main hua tha
 Jaswant Singh died in Afghanistan in 1678 and he had no heir declared at the time of his death
 aurangzeb ne maukey kaa phayda uthaate huye marwar main apana hastkshep jamaane kaa prayaas kiya
 This led to the formation of a Mughal strategy to destroy the Hindus and the Mughal army could not succeed even after much bloodshed
 jaswant singh ke nidhan ke baad unki do raniyon ne nar bachche ko janm diya
 One of them died only after birth and the other succeeded him as Ajit Singh
 farvari 1679 tak yah samachar aurangzaib tak pahunchaa lekin unhone bachche vaid vaaris ke rup main maanane se manaa kar diya
 He also imposed jizya tax
 ab maharaj ajitsingh kii aayu atharah varsh kii thi
 Gradually, the work of the state was understood, and he was able to carry the kingdom without the help of Durgadas
 yah dekhakar vir durgaadaraas ne sanwat 1758 vi
 main maharaj ajit ko bhaar saunp diya
 Used to give his consent when needed
 jab 1765 vi
 main aurangzeb dakshin main maaraa gaya to uskaa jyeshtha putr muajjam gaddi par baitha or apane purvaj badshaah akbar kii bhaanti apni praja kaa paalan karne laga
 There was no discrimination between Hindus and Muslims
 yah dekh durgadas ne nishcint hokar purna rup se rajyabhaar ajitsingh ko saunp diya, kintu swatantra hokar ajitsingh ke swabhaav main bahut parivartan hone laga
 Like a bursting bed, the water became free
 apane swechhachari mitron ke kehane se praja ko kabhi-kabhi nyaay viruddh baari dand de detaa tha
 Gradually the power to consider their loss and profit began to wane
 jo jaisi salaah detaa tha
 , Used to get ready to do it
 swayan kuch na dekhtaa tha
 , Used to listen with ears only
 jisane pehle kaan phunke, usee kii baat satya samajhataa tha
 Gradually the subjects also started blasphemy
 durgadas ne kai baar niti-upadesh kiya, bahut kuch samajhaayaa-bujhaayaa, parantu camel ke patto par jis prakaar jal kii boond thahar jaati he, or vaayu ke jhakore se turant hi gir jaati he, usee prakaar jo kuch ajitsingh ke hriday-patal par upadesh kaa asar hua, turant hi swaarthee mitron ne nikaal phenkaa or yahaan tak praytn kiya ki durgadas kii ore se maharaj kaa manamalinya ho gaya
 Gradually the injustice continued to increase
 vivash hokar durgadas ne apane parivaar ko udaipur bhej diya or akelaa hi jodhpur main rahakar anyaay ke parinaam kii pratiksha karne laga
 When a person could not even see the poison tree watered with his hand, it was the son of the revered Swami Shri Maharaj Jaswant Singh ji of Veer Durgadas
 , uskaa naash hote vah kab dekh saktaa tha
 But what does it do? It was not his fault in front of selfish friends, so he decided to go out of Jodhpur
 avasar paakar ek din maharaj se vidaa lene ke liye darbar ja rahaa tha
 On the way, an old man was found, who was a well-wisher of Durgadas
 kehane laga bhai durgadas! acha hota, yadi aap aaj raaj-darbar na jate; kyonki aaj darbar jane main aapaki kushal nahin
 As far as i have come to know, Maharaj has secretly given permission to kill you with the advice of his selfish friends
 durgadas ne kaha – ‘ bhai! ab main vruddh hua, mujhe maranaa to he hi phir kshatriya hokar mrityu se kyon darun? rajputi main kalank lagaaun; maut se darkar peeche laut jaaun! is prakaar kahata hua nirbhay singh ke samaan darbar main pahunchaa or haath jodakar maharaj se tirthayatr ke liye vidaa maangi
 Maharaj said with an upper mind - 'chachaji! Your separation will be very sad for us; But now you are old, and the question is of pilgrimage; That is why it is not done either
 acha to jaaie, parantu jahaan tak sambhav ho sheeghra hi laut aaie
 Durgadas said - 'just as the Maharaja commanded and walked; But returned to the door
 maharaj ne poocha chachaa ji, kyon? durgadas ne kaha – ‘ maharaj, ab aaj na jaaoongaa; mujhe abhi yaad aayaa ki maharaj yashawantisingh ji mujhe ek gupt kosh kii chaabi de gayi the, parantu abhi tak main na to aapako gupt khajaana hi bataa sakaa or na chaabi hi de sakaa; isliye vah bhi aapako saunp duun, tab jaaun? kyonki ab main bahut vruddh ho gaya hum, na-jane kab or kahaan mar jaaun? tab to yah aseem dhan-raashi sab mitti main mil jaayegi
 On hearing this, the greed suppressed Ajitsingh
 sansar main aisa koun he, jise lobh ne na gheraa ho? kisne lobh devtaa kii ajna kaa ulanghan kiya he? sochane laga; yadi mere aagyaanusaar durgadas kahin maaraa gaya,to yah sampatti apane haath na aa sakegi
 Will there be no more opportunities? Will be seen again yah vichaar kar apane mitron ko sanket kiya
 Realizing this, one went ahead and removed the appointed man from there
 is prakaar dhokhe se dhan kaa laalach dekar chatur durgadas ne apane praanon kii raksha kii
 Came home, took arms, rode a horse and sent Maharaj saying that Durgadas did not want to die the death of dogs
 ran-kshetra main jis vir kii himmat ho aaye
 Ajitsingh trembled upon hearing this message
 bolaa durgadas jahaan janaa chaahe, jane do

 In order to note the speeches of Cicero etc
 in the Senate of Rome, Marcus Tullius Tiro invented a system of quick writing, called 'tironian Note'
 is pranali kaa prachlan rome samrajya ke patan ke pashchaat kai shatabdiyon baad tak rahaa
 Simultaneously, there was an invention of dermatography in Greece in the fourth century BCE, which continued till the eighth century

 During the time of Queen Elizabeth, a shorthand called 'bright's System' was invented
 phir san 1630 itho main tamas shelaton ne twaralekhan par ek pustak prakashit karai
 Subsequently, in 1737 AD, Dr
 John Byron published a book titled 'universal English Short Hand' of the scribe
 kintu in sabhi paddatiyon main laghupran aksharon ko hataakar tathaa kuch anya aksharon ko shabdon ke bich main se nikaalkar sankshipt kiya jaataa tha, isse vaktaa ke bhaashan ko note karne main sahuuliyat ho jaati thi
 But at the same time there was an attempt to write on the basis of sound
 dhwani paddati : sar ijak pitman kii pustak 'stegographic sound hand' san 1837 itho main prakashit hui
 In this method, vowels and consonants were determined by different symbols
 saath hi sankshipt karne kaa bhi ek niyam banaaya gaya
 This method continued to develop and later on the system proved to be very useful

 Due to the fact that Hindi transcription is not economically profitable and Hindi is not an important place in British India, the effort to explore acceleration was relatively delayed
 kintu phir bhi twaralekhan ke avishkaar ke liye yadakada praytn hote rahe
 At the time of the movements for independence, the Government of British India used to note down the speeches of the leaders in Hindi, so that they could hold the leaders accountable for the objectionable views expressed against the government

 In 1907 AD, the Kashi Nagri Pracharini Sabha published a book titled 'hindi' shorthand of Shri Nishkameshwar Mishra, BA, LT, which is the first important book of its subject in Hindi dermatography

 With the help of Horcrux, any powerful magician can divide his soul into two or more pieces and store it in a common object, so that even if he dies, some part of his life can be protected by Horcrux
 horcras banane ke liye hatya kerani padati he
 In this way black magicians want to achieve immortality
 dusht lord voldemort ne saat horcrax banaaye the
 Both organisms and non-living animals are used to make horcruxes, although the use of organisms in this is risky, as any living being can defend itself and think
 The number of horcruxes a magician can create is unlimited
 However, the soul of the creator is gradually divided into many small pieces, so he loses his natural humanity and his soul becomes very temporary
 In highly specific circumstances, a piece of the soul can be locked into an object without the knowledge and intention of the creator
 The object in which the piece of the soul will be protected in this way will preserve the immortality of the creator just like any other horcrux, but it will not come under the "secret magical object"
 is hatya ke prayaas main volde mock mort kaa sharir nasht ho gaya tha or uski aatma kaa ek bhaag harry ke andar sthapit ho gaya tha
 Harry was told by Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
 horcrax saat prakaar ke he | Tom Riddle used his diary to create his second Horcrux during his sixth year at Hogwarts
 usne baslisk dwaara apni sahpaathee moining mirtal kii htya karke is horkrax ko banane ke liye mantra padhe
 is diary ke sambandh main da chembar of sicrates ke duusare paath main zikr kiya gaya he or isi kitaab ke antim pathon ke dauraan yah diary harry potter dwaara nasht kar di jaati he
 Before his downfall, Voldemort had handed this horcrux to Lucius Malfoy
 malphoy is diary kii vikrut jaadui shaktiyon ke baar main to jaanata tha, lekin use yah nahin pataa tha ki yah diary ek horkrax thi
 In an attempt to humiliate Arthur Weasley, Malfoy hides the diary in Ginny Weasley's calldran among his books
 The part of Tom Riddle's soul secured in this diary had Ginny subdued and was about to prove her purpose by re-opening the Chamber of Secrets
 duusari kitaab ke ant main, harry ne gini ko bachaa liya or baslisk ke jahrile daanton dwaara ise nasht kar diya, is prakaae harry ne ise nasht hone vaala pehla horkrax bana diya
 jab usne dambaldor ko is diary ke sambandh main bataaya to dambaldor ko pehali baar aisa abhas hua ki voldemort ne ek nahin, balki kai horkrax banaaye hai: "jo baat mujhe sabase zyada vismayakari lag rahi thi vah ye thi ki yah diary ek hathiyaar or ek bachaav donon hi tareeke se istemaal kii gayi he", rouling, half-blad prince jisase yah sanket miltaa he ki avashya hi voldemort ke paas anya purtikar upaay bhi hai
 The diary, for Rowling, is a very scary thing, he also said in an interview: "the temptation to write all the things in my heart in a diary is huge, especially for a young girl
" Rowling's younger sister, Diane, had a similar habit and her biggest rate was that someone would read her diary
 From this, Rowling got the idea of the role of a diary in his story, such a diary that would be in opposition to the person who wrote his secret things in it
 When asked what would have happened if Ginny had died and Tom Riddle had succeeded in getting out, Rowling refused to give a straight answer but said "this would have made today's Voldemort very powerful "

 He recited the mantra of making horcruxes after killing his father
 This ring was mentioned in the fourth lesson of the Half Blood Prince, it had already been destroyed by Albus Dumbledore, but this was not yet revealed
 pencive kii ek memory main yah prakat hota he ki riddle ne vah sone kii anguthi apane ankal morphine gaunt se le lee thi jisamen ek kala pathar tha, jis par ek jaadui chinh bana hua tha, usne apane ankal kii yaaddaasht badalane ke dwaara unhen apane pita or apane naanaa-nani kii mrityu ke aparaadh main fansaa diya tha
 Riddle was still wearing this ring while studying as a student at Hogwarts, but eventually hides it in the house where the Gaunt family lived
 jab tak dambaldor ne ise order of da finnics or half-blad prince ke bich garmiyon kii chuttee ke dauraan dhund nahin liya tab tak yah fladboard ke andar chhipi hui thi or anekon mantron daara surakshit thi
 Dumbledore destroys this horcrux with the sword of Goudrick Gryffindor, though after wearing this ring he is severely wounded by its curse
 His right hand was forever deformed by this injury, and if Severus Snape had not come there, he would have died instantly, Snape reduced the speed of this curse in Dumbledore's right hand and arm, This caused a lot of wrinkles on his hand, but this curse still extended to his right arm and if he had succeeded in moving further, he would surely have died
 The destroyed ring was kept on his desk in the headmaster's office for some time
 apni mrityu se pehle, dambaldor is anguthi ke kaale pathar ko ek golden snitch main chipa dete hai or vah apni vasiyat main yah snitch harry ke adhikaar main chhod jate hai
 dambaldor ne yah jaan liya tha ki vastav main yah pathar risrection stone he, joki teen dethale hellos main se ek he
 yahi kaaran tha ki dambaldor ne yah anguthi apni ungali main pahan lee thi: ve ise sakriya karke apane mrit parivaar se sampark karne kii aashaa main the, lekin yah bhul gaye the ki ab yah anguthi ek horkrax bhi he or isiilie kaaphi sambhaavna he ki yah vinaashkari mantron dwaara surakshit ho

 Tom Riddle created his fourth Horcrux from a locket of Salazar Slitherin that once belonged to Riddle's mother, Merope Gaunt
 riddle ne ek jaadui shaktiyon se rahit bhikhaari kii hatya karke is locket par mantra padhe
 order of finnics main is locket ke sambandh main sankshep main bataaya gaya he or ise dethale hellos ke unnisven paath main ron visli dwaara nasht kiy jaataa he

 When abandoned by her husband Tom Riddle Sr
, Merope sold it to Lockett, Bourgin & Berks' shopkeeper, Karafactus Burke, for 10 galleons, which was a small fraction of Lockett's actual value
 antatah yah locket hepazibah smith ko bech diya gaya
 riddle ne smith kii htya karne ke baad helga hafalpaf ke cap ke saath yah locket bhi chura liya
 is locket ke hor kraks ban jane ke baad, voldemort ne ise ek gupha main chipa diya, jahaan par usne ek baar apane saath ke do anaath bacchon ko daraaya tha
 Under the magical protection of this cave, a door, which was opened only after the blood was sacrificed, included a magical boat, a basin of potions, which caused the drinker with much pain and terrible scenes and the use of corpses

 In an attempt to bring Voldemort's final downfall, he and his domestic elf creator had stolen the locket by breaking the magical defenses

 He gave this locket as a bribe to Dolores Ambridge when he was caught selling stolen goods
 Two years later, Harry, Ron and Hermione stole the locket by sneaking into the Ministry of Magic, where Ambridge worked
 Later, when Harry wore this locket around his neck, this locket started to choke him, on which Ron saved Harry
 When Ron attempts to destroy the locket, the part of the soul inside the locket takes the form of Harry and Hermione, and starts to play with Ron's fear that his two special friends have turned against each other in his absence
 Have become romantic Ron had destroyed this locket in the Forest of Dean by Goudrick Gryffindor's sword
 antim kitaab ke baad jari kii gayi samikshaon main bataaya gaya kii salaajaar sliderin kii locket, da lord of da rings kii ek ring ke jaisi hi he, kyonki donon hi vasteen apane pahanane vaale ke vyaktitv par nakaaratmak prabhaav daalati hai, donon ko hi nasht karnaa bahut kathin he or ye donon hi apane banane vaale ke liye amartv sunishchit karti hai
 Tom Riddle used a cup of Hogwarts founder Helga Hufflepuff to make his third horcrux
 Before killing the mantra on this cup, he poisoned Hepzibah Smith and killed him
 This cup was mentioned in the twentieth text of the Half Blood Prince and was destroyed by Hermione in the twenty-first text of Deathly Hallows
 hepazibah smith, jiske paas yah cap tha, vah helga hafalpaf kii dur kii vanshaj thi
 Riddle killed Smith, stole the cup and implicated Smith's domestic elf hockey in the crime
 Voldemort had handed the cup to Bellatrix Lestrange, who kept it safe in his vault at the Gringotts Bank, a place that, according to Harry's estimation, would have been watching Voldemort's avant-garde ever without money
 Additional protective spells to protect the contents of this vault, including gemino and flagrante curs
 Harry, Ron and Hermione stole the cup after entering the bank
 Hermione later destroys it with a pointed tooth of a leftover basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets
 lord voldemort ne apana paanchvaan horkrax hallverts kii sah sansthaapak rouvena revencla ke mukut main banaaya
is horkrax ko banaae ke liye padhe jane vaale aavashyak mantra ko voldemort ne ek albanian kisaan kii htya karne ke baad padhaa tha
 The crown was mentioned by its name in the book Deathly Hallows, but it was actually first mentioned in The Room of the Environment in The Half Blood Prince as "a tarnished crown"
 revencla kii beti helena, jise da grey ladi of revencla ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, ne apni maa se adhik budhimaan banane ke prayaas main yah unase mukut chura liya tha
 She fled to Albania and when the Bloody Baron was trying to find her, she hid the crown in the hollow of a tree
 After Helena's assassination by Bloody Baron, she becomes Ravencla's House Ghost and while studying at that school, Tom Riddle captivated her with magic to tell her the exact position of the crown
 Shortly after leaving Hogwarts and the murder of Hepzibah Smith, from where Riedl stole Slidherin's locket and Hufflepuff's cup, he went to Albania and took the crown even as he planned to rise to power
 Several years later, when Voldemort came back to Hogwarts and reapplied for the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, to which Albus Dumbledore refused to give him the position, he hid the crown in the Room of Requirement 
 nagini vah saanp he jise voldemort mort hameshaa apane saath rakhata he
 harry potter ke atirikt yah ekmaatr anya sajiv horkrax tha
 In the book Goblet of Fire, Voldemort kept himself alive with this snake's poison before being revived by Peter Petty Grew
 jab voldemort albania ke jangalon main chhipata tha tab usne is horkrax ko banaaya tha
 Nagini was destroyed by Naval Longbottom in the Deathly Hallows with the same sword that destroyed the Laukettatha ring
 mukhya lekh : harry potter voldemort ne anjaane main apni aatma kaa ek bhaag harry potter kii htya karne ke prayaas ke dauraan usee ke andar sthapit kar diya
 yah ghatana da philosophers stone ke pehle paath ke thik pehle ghatit hoti he
 rouling ne spasht rup se kaha he ki harry kabhi bhi sahi myanon main ek "dark object" nahin tha kyonki us par horkrax banane vaala mantra nahin padhaa gaya tha
 It is another matter that, like other Horcruxes, as long as part of Voldemort's soul is in Harry, he will remain immortal
 At the end of the thirty-fourth lesson of The Deathly Hallows, part of Voldemort's soul is inadvertently destroyed by the Elder Wand by him
 As a child, Harry Potter was in the same room as the deadly Killing Curse planted by Voldemort back in the same
 Reflected on
 Due to the constant killing and the horcruxes he created, his soul became very weak and temporary
 is asafal kars ke kaaran voldemort kii aatma kaa ek ansh uske sharir se nikalakar harry ke sharir main chalaa gaya jisase ki harry vastutah ek horkrax ban gaya
 harry ke maathe par bijli ke baan jaisaa nishaan is yatit htya kaa pratyaksh parinaam tha
 This relationship has been used to describe many key points of the plot
 Throughout the series, Harry is able to experience Voldemort's mental and emotional states, through which the book reader also becomes indirectly aware of the major sadist of the series
 Harry's forehead scar often hurts during these events of experience
 Harry also had the ability to speak and explain Paraseltung through Voldemort
 rouling ke dwaara ek saakshaatkaar main yah bataaya gaya he ki voldemort ke shashakt bhaawanaaon kaa anubhav kiye jane par harry ke maathe ke nishaan main aksar hone vaala dard, vastav main voldemort kii aatma kaa vahi ansh he jo harry ke sharir main pravesh kar yi thi or vah in avasthaaon main harry ke sharir ko chhodkar apni pradhan aatma ke saath milane ko tatpar rahati he
jab volde momert ko harry kii duranubhuti kshamta ke vishay main paata chalaa to bhi vah harry ke sharir main upasthit apni aatma ke ansh se anjaan tha
 When Voldemort attempted Harry's assassination by the Killing Curse at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, he himself destroyed part of his soul inside Harry
 With it destroyed, the contact between the two also ended and Harry never again felt pain on his forehead
 Rowling said that Harry's ability to speak and understand parceltung was also ended
 Ices: Arun, or Uranus, is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system
 vyas ke aadhaar par yah saura mandal kaa teesraa bada or dravyaman ke aadhaar par chauthaa bada grah he
 It is 14
5 times heavier than Earth in mass and 63 times larger than Earth in shape
 ausat rup main dekha jaae to prithvi se bahut kam ghanaa he - kyonki prithvi par pathar or anya baari padaarth adhik pratishat main hai jabaki arun par gas adhik he
 That is why it is only four and a half to fourteen times heavier than the earth, despite having a size of three to three times larger than the earth
 haalanki arun ko bina doorabeen ke aankh se bhi dekha ja saktaa he, yah itnaa dur he or itani madhyam roshni kaa prathit hota he ke pracheen vidwaanon ne kabhi bhi ise grah kaa darja nahin diya or ise ek dur timatimaata tara hi samajha
 On 13 March 1781, William Herschel announced its discovery
 arun doorabeen dwaara paae jane vaala pehla grah tha
 The four planets in our solar system are called gas demons, because they contain mostly gas instead of clay and stone and they are very large in size
 arun iname se ek he - baaki teen brihaspati, shani or varun hai
 Of these, Arun's texture is very similar to Varun
 arun or varun ke vaataavaran main brihaspati or shani ke tulana main barf adhik he - pani kii barf ke atirikt inamen jami hui ammonia or methane gaison kii barf bhi he
 So sometimes astronomers put these two in the category called "icy Gas Monsters"
 saura mandal ke saare grahon main se arun kaa vayumandal sab se thanda paaya gaya he or uskaa nunatam taapmaana -49 calvin dekha gaya he
 Many planets of clouds have been seen in this planet
 maananaa he ke sab se neeche pani ke badal hai or sab se upar methane gas ke badal hai
 It is also believed that if somehow the center of Arun could be seen at its center, snow and stones would be found there
 urenus prayek 84 prithvi varshon main surya kaa ek chakkar lagaataa he
 Its average distance from the Sun is about 3 billion km
 urenus par surya prakaash kii tivrata prithvi par kii tulana main lagbhag 1 / 1400 he
 Its orbital elements were first calculated by pierre-cimon Laplace in 1783
 Over time, discrepancies between predicted and observed orbits began to appear, and in 1841 John Couch Adams first proposed that this difference could be due to the gravitational pull of an invisible planet
 1845 main, urbain lee verrier ne uranus kii kaksha par apana swatantra anusandhan shuru kiya | 23 sitambar 1846 ko johaan gotfrid gaale ne ek nayaa grah khoja, baad main iskaa naam neptune rakhaa gaya, yah lee verrier dwaara anumaan lagaayee gai sthiti ke kareeb tha
 The rotation period within Uranus is 17 hours, 14 minutes
 sabhi mahakay grahon kii tarah, iskaa upari vayumandal bhi ghurnan kii disha main bahut shaktishaalee hawaaon ko mahasoos karata he
 At some latitudes, such as two-thirds of the way from the equator to the South Pole, the visual motifs of the atmosphere move very rapidly and form a complete rotation of the smallest 14 hours
 urenus kaa aksheeya jhukaav 97
77 degree he, isliye isaki ghurnan dhuri soramandal tal ke saath kareeb kareeb samanaantar he
 This gives him completely different seasonal changes unlike other major planets
 anya grah soramandal tal par dolate lattuon kii tarah ghoomte hue dekhe ja sakate he, jabaki urenus ek dolati ludhakti gend kii tarah paribhraman karata he
 Near the time of Uranus solstice, one pole is constantly facing the sun while the other pole is beyond
 keval bumadhyarekha ke aasapaas kaa sankara patta drut din-raat ke chakron ko mahasoos karata he, lekin kshitij par bahut neeche surya ke saath saath jis tarah se prithvi ke dhruviya kshetron main hota he
 The orientation of the poles opposite the Sun on the other side of Uranus' orbit is reversed
 prayek dhruv 42 varshon ke aasapaas lagaataar ujaalaa paata he, phir agle 42 varsh andhere main gujaarta he
 Near the time of the equinoxes, the sun is in front of the equinox of Uranus and gives a time period of day-night cycles, similar to that seen in most other planets
 urenus apane sabase haal ke vishuv par 7 disambar 2007 ko pahunchaa | One consequence of this axial tilt is that, in the mean period of the year, Uranus's polar regions receive a larger share of the energy invested from the Sun than its equatorial regions
 phir bhi urenus, apane dhruvon par kii tulana main apni bumadhyarekha par zyada tapt he
 The underlying mechanism responsible for this is unknown
 uranus ke asaamaanya dhuriy jhukaav kaa kaaran bhi nischitata ke saath gyaat nahin he, lekin hameshaa kii tarah atakalein yah he ki soramandal nirmaan ke dauraan, ek prithvi ke aakaar kaa aadigrah uranus ke saath takaraayaa or is visham abhivinyas kaa kaaran bana | 1986 main voager 2 ke gujaarey ke samay uranus kaa dakshin dhruv takreeban sidhe surya kii ore tha
 Its pole uses a definition supported by the recent International Astronomical Union for identification as "south", despite the planet's direction of rotation
 arthath ki grah yaa upgrah kaa uttari dhruv vah dhruv hoga jo soramandal ke avikari tal ke upar kii ore hoga
 Sometimes a different convention is used, in which the north and south poles of a body are defined according to the south-hand rule with respect to the direction of rotation
 is duusari nirdeshaank pranali kii sharton main uranus kaa uttar dhruv vah tha jo 1986 main surya kii ore tha
 From 1995 to 2006, Uranus' virtual magnitude fluctuated between + 5

 This value indicates that it is mainly composed of different types of ice, such as water, ammonia, and methane
 The overall amount of ice in the interior of Uranus is not known properly, different figures emerge according to the choice of the model, it should be between 9
3 and 13
5 of the Earth's mass
 Hydrogen and helium make up only a small part of the composite
 The remaining non-ice content is composed of rocky material

 use daasatv se chhudaane ke liye vah ek raat charudatt ke ghar main send lagaakar vasantsena dwaara dharohar rakhe gaye sone ke saare aabhushan chura letaa he
 On the other hand, Chaudutt's paternal wife Dhuta gives her precious Ratnavali in exchange for stolen robes to save her husband from Loknanda, Chaudutt gives the Ratnavali and sends the clown Maitreya to Vasantasena's house
 chauthaa ank : sharvilak churaae hue aabhushan lekar madnika ko daasatv se mukt karaane ke liye vasantsena ke ghar pahunchataa he
 Madanika is very sad to hear about the theft
 is galati ko sudhaarney kii bhaavana se vah sharvilak ko yah samajhaati he ki chori ke aabhushan vasantsena ko saunp dene se na vah chor rahegaa, na charudatt ke sir par rin rahegaa or vasantsena ke aabhushan use vaapis mil jaayenge, sharvilak aisa hi karata he
 He tells Vasantasena that Charudatta has sent the message that we cannot keep the goldsmith safe by having a dilapidated house, so keep it with you
 vasantsena sandesh ke badale main kuch le jane kii baat kahkar madnika ko sharvilak ko saunp detii he
 In this issue, the clown meets Vasantasena and says that Swarnapatra has lost in gambling, so accept this Ratnavali
 vasantsena vaastaviktaa jaanati he, par kuch nahin karti
 She decides to come to Charudatta's house in the evening
 paanchavaan ank : is ank main varsha-ritu varnan hua he
 Vasantasena meets Charudatta and stays overnight at his house due to rain
 chatha ank : subah charudatt pushpkarndak udyaan main ghoomane jaataa he, vasantsena ke liye gaadi taiyaar rakhane kaa aadesh dekar taaki vah usamen udyaan tak yatra kar sake
 It is here that Vasantasena sees Chaudatta's son Rohsen insisting that he wants to play with a gold ball, not a clay car
 vasantsena saare aabhushan mitti kii gaadi main rakhkar kahati he ki isse sone kii gaadi bana lenaa
 Vasantasena comes out to meet Charudatta in the garden, but mistakenly sits in the car park standing at the same place
 udhar karagaar todakar, rakshak ko markar nikal bhaaga gwaale kaa betaa aryak, bachaav ke liye charudatt ke vaahan main chadh jaataa he
 On the way, two police soldiers - Veerak and Chandanak, also see the vehicle, but one of them lets Aryaak go by promising to protect him
 saatvaan ank : raja paalak ne sidhon kii bhavishyavaanee par vishwaas karke jis aryak naamak vyakti ko bandi bana liya tha, jab vah bandhan todakar bachataa hua charudatt kii gaadi main chadhakar udyaan main charudatt ke samaksh aata he or unase shaaran maangata he
 Charudatta gets him safely out of his car
 aathvaan ank : bhul se shaakaar kii gaadi main baithi vasantsena jab udyaan main pahunchati he to charudatt ke sthaan par dusht shaakaar se uskaa saamana hota he
 Vasantasena once again falls into the clutches of Shakara, on not accepting Shakkar's insistence, he strangles Vasantasena and leaves him covered with leaves knowing he is dead

 There are two stories in Mrithaktik
 ek charudatt kii, duusari aryak kii
 The legend of Gunadhya tells the revolt of Gopal Darak Aryak
 brihatkatha apane mul rup main pashachi bhashaa main ‘baddkaha’ ke naam se likhi gai thi
 This shows that this play is of the first century AD or the second century AD
 yah naatak sanskrit sahitya main apana vishesh sthaan rakhata he
 in this- ye isaki visheshtaayen hai
 The political feature of this play is that it has been described as bad Kshatriya king
 gop-putr 'aryak' ek gwaala he, jise kavi raja banaata he
 Although the poet considers Varnashrama, he makes Gopa the king
 aisa lagata he ki yah moolkatha puraani he or sambhavtah yah ghatana koi vaastavik ghatana he jo kinvadanti main rah gai
 The depiction of slavery society is very beautiful and we find it in the time of Chanakya, when the word 'arya' is used as 'citizen'
 ho saktaa he, koi puraani kinvadanti chanakya ke baad ke samay main is katha main utar ai ho
 During the time of Buddha, the rise of traders was also considerable
 tab ujjayini kaa rajya alag tha, kosal kaa alag
 Ujjayini is also described here
 ek jagah lagata he ki us samay bhi bharat kii ekta kaa abhas tha, jab kaha gaya he ki 'sari prithvi aryak ne jeet lee' – vah prithvi jisaki kailas pataakaa he
 If seen, the poet was realistic and impartial
 usne sabaki achchhaayiyaan or buraaiyaan dikhaai hai or badi gaharaai se chithran kiya he
 This is the reason for his success
 yah maharaj shudrak kii kriti maani jaati he jo bhaas or kalidas kii bhaanti raaj kavi hue hai

 kaha jaataa he, bhasapranit 'charudutt' naamak chaturangi roopak kii kathavstu ko parivardhit kar kisi parvarti shudra kavi ke dwaara mrichctic kii rachana hui he
 In fact, the basis of its narrative is found in the stories narrated in Brihatkatha and Kathasaritsagara
 mrichctic’ kii katha kaa kendra he ujjayini
 He is such a big city that the conductor of Pataliputra comes to settle his fame and gain business after hearing his fame
 us samay vah patliputra ko mahanagar nahin kahata
 This means that Ujjayini was more important than Pataliputra at that time
 spasht hi patliputra buddha ke samay main patliputra tha, jabaki ujjayini main mahasen chand pradyot kaa samrudh rajya tha
 The second antiquity is that there is a lot of slavery in it
 das-daasi dhan dekar azaad kar liye jate the
 The courtesans also became brides in that society
 yah sab baaten aise samaaj kii hai, jahaan zyaada kadai nahin milti, jo baad main chaalu hui thi
 Rather, the poet has set a new ideal in the society by making the bride a bride
 usamen vidroh kii bhaavana he
 He kills the oppressor like an animal, elevates the woman and the slave frees the settler

 hepatitis bi virus ke sankraman kaa pataa lagane ke liye pareekshan, jise parakh kaha jaataa he main cerum yaa rakt pariksha shaamil hota he jo yaa to viral antigen yaa phir mejabaan ke dwaara utpaadit antibodies kii pahchaan karata he
 The interpretation of these tests is complex
 hepatitis bi sataha antigen kaa is sankraman kii upasthiti ke liye aksar baar-baar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is the first identifiable viral antigen that appears during infection
 haalanki, ek sankraman ke shuru main, yah antigen upasthit nahin bhi rah saktaa he or baad main yah anapahachaanaa bhi rah saktaa he kyonki yah mejabaan dwaara saaf kiya jaataa rahata he
 Infectious virions also have an inner "core particle" enclosing the viral genome
 isahedral kor kan 180 yaa 240 prati kor protein se bana hota he, jo vaikalpik rup se hepatitis bi kor antigen hbcag ke rup main gyaat he
 During the same 'window' in which hosts remain infected but successfully clear the vices, igm antibodies to hepatitis b core antigen may be the only serological evidence of the disease
 hbeag ke prakat hone ke turant baad hepatitis b e naamak ek or antigen prakat ho jayega
 paramparaagat rup se, mejabaan ke serum main hbeag kii upasthiti viral pratikruti ke adhik ucch daron se yukt hota he or prabhaavaheenata ko badha detaa he; tathaapi, hepatitis bi virus ke verient 'i' antigen kaa utpaadan nahin karte isliye yah niyam hameshaa sach nahin hota he
 During the natural course of infection, hbeag can be cleared and antibodies to the 'E' antigen are produced immediately after
 yah roopantaran aamtaur par viral pratikruti main naatakeey giravat ke saath judaa hai
 If the host is able to clear the infection, hbsag will eventually become undetectable and will then produce igg antibodies and core antigens from the hepatitis b surface
 The time period between the removal of hbsag and the appearance of anti-hbs is called the window period
 hbsag ke liye nakaaratmak evam anti-hbc ke liye sakaaratmak vyakti yaa to sankraman ko khatm kar chukaa hota he yaa use pehle se tikaa lagaaya gaya hota he
 Individuals who have been in hbsag positive for at least six months are considered as carriers of hepatitis B
 virus ke vaahakon ko chronic hepatitis bi ho saktaa he jo unnat serum elnin aminotranscourej str or liver ke sujan dwaara parilakshith hoga, jaisaa ki biopsy se pataa chalata he
 Carriers that are seroconverted in the event of a negative hbeag infection, especially those who have acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and thus have long-term complications or other infections
 The risk of transmitting is less
 pisiar pareekshan ko echbivi diene kii pahchaan or maap ke liye viksit kiya gaya he jise chikitsakeey namoonay main viral lod kaha jaataa he
 These tests are used to evaluate a person's infection status and to monitor treatment
 ucch viral lod vaale vyaktiyon ke paas, khaas andaaj main biopsy par ground glass hepatocites hota he
 Several vaccines have been developed by Maurice Hillman for the prevention of Hepatitis b virus infection
 ye viral invelp protein ke ek upyog par vishwaas karte he
 The vaccines are originally made from plasma obtained from patients with long-term hepatitis b virus infection
 haalanki, vartmaan main, yah ek synthetic riconbinent diene takanic kaa upyog kar ke banaaya jaataa he jisamen rakt utpaada nahin hote
 is tike se aap hepatitis bi ko nahin pakad sakate
 After vaccination, hepatitis b surface antigen can be found in the serum for several days, known as vaccine antigenemia
 tikaa ko vyask or shishuon main yaa to do-teen yaa chaar khuraaq anusoochiyon main iskaa bandobast kiya jaataa he jo vyaktiyon ko 85-90% kii suraksha pradaan karata he
 In individuals who show adequate early response to the initial course of vaccination, protection was monitored for 12 years and this immunity was predicted for at least the last 25 years
 hepatitis e ke vipareet hepatitis bi aam taur par bhojan or pani ke madhyam se nahin failata
 iske bajaay, yah sharir ke taral padaarth ke sancharan ke madhyam se failata he, isliye isaki rokthaam is prakaar ke sancharan kaa parihaar kar ke kiya jaataa he: asurakshit yon sampark, raktaadhan, sandooshit suiyon or sirinjon kaa dubaara prayog or bachche ke janm ke dauraan urdhwadhar sancharan
 shishuon ke janm ke samay tikaa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Shi, et al have shown that combined lamivudine, efficacy and efficacy in hbv-carrying mothers with a high level of infectivity in small doses of hepatitis b immune globulin, or in the later days of pregnancy, despite combined immunoprophylaxis starting with WHO recommended new births
 HBV in a protective manner inhibits intrauterine transmission, a new addition to the prevention of HBV at the initial stage The Shti provided
 teevr hepatitis bi sankraman ke upachaar kii aamtaur par aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he kyonki zyaadaatar vayask anayas hi sankraman ko mukt kar dete hai
 Initial antiviral treatment may be required only by less than 1% of patients whose infection has a very aggressive course or who are immunocompromised
 duusari ore, chronic sankraman ke upachaar ke liye serosis or liver cancer ke jokhim ko kam karnaa aavashyak ho saktaa he
 Infected individuals with chronically dysregulated elevated alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver damage, and HBV DNA levels are candidates for therapy
 haalanki uplabdh davaaiyon main koi bhi sankraman ko khatm nahin kar saktaa, ye virus ko pratikruti se roak sakate hai or liver kii kshati ko kam kar sakate hai
 Currently, seven medications of hepatitis b infection are licensed in the United States
 inamen antiveiral drugs lamivudin, adefovir, tenophovir, telbivudine, evam intecvir tathaa do pratiraksha pranali madulators interferon alpha 2a or pegilated anterferon alpha -2a shaamil hai
 The use of interferon, which needs to be injected daily or three days a week, is replaced by long-term active pegylated interferon, which is injected once a week
 haalanki, kuch vyakti dusron kii apeksha sambhavat: adhik pratikriya karte hai or yah sankraman karne vaale virus ke genotip yaa rogi kii anuvanshikta ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 Treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, reducing viral load
 hepatitis bi kii vaahak maataaon se turant janme shishuon kaa ilaaj hepatitis bi virus ke antibody se kiya ja saktaa he
 When the vaccine is given within twelve hours of birth, the risk of hepatitis acquisition is reduced by 90%
 yah ilaaj ek maan ko apane bachche ko surakshit stanpan karaane ke liye anumati detaa he
 In July 2005, researchers at a * STAR and National University of Singapore identified the linkage of a DNA protein and HBV replication in patients with a class of protein heterogenous nucleon ribonucleoprotein K
 Control of hnrnp k levels may serve as a possible cure for HBV
 ilaaj kaa prabhaav ginotips ke bich alag-alag hota he
 Interferon treatment can produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype a but only 6% seroconversion in type D
 Genotype b has seroconversion rates similar to Type A
 tip e or bi main nirantar i antigen nuksaan ilaaj ke baad ~ 45% he lekin tip si or di main keval 25-30% he
 Hepatitis b virus infections can be either acute or chronic
 Individuals with self-limiting infections spontaneously eliminate the infection within weeks to months
 vayaskon kii tulana main bacchon main sankraman ko khatm karne kii kam sambhaavna hoti he
 More than 95% of people who are infected as adults or aged children recover completely and develop immunity to the virus
 haalanki, 30% chote bacchon ke liye or keval 5% nae janmen shishu ke liye jo janm ke samay apni maataaon se sankraman adhigrahan karte hai, yah drop sankraman ko dur karegaa
 is aabaadi ko jivan paryant serosis yaa hepatocellular carcinoma se 40% maut kaa khatra he
 70% of those infected between the age of six will remove the infection
 hepatitis di keval sahavarti hepatitis bi sankraman se utpann ho sakate hai, kyonki HDV echbivi sataha antigen kaa upyog capcid nirmaan ke liye karata he
 Coagulation with hepatitis d increases the risk of cancer and liver cirrhosis
 polyarteritis nodosa hepatitis bi sankraman vaale logon main adhik saamaanya he
 Hepatitis b virus remains firm in the body after DNA infection and some people have recurrence of the disease
 haalanki durlabh, punarskriyan adhiktar aksar durbal pratiraksha se yukt rogiyon main dekha jaataa he
 HBV goes through cycles of replication and non-replication
 lagbhag 50% rogi teevr punarskriyan kaa anubhav karte hai
 Male patients with a baseline ALT of 200 ul / L are three times more likely to develop reactivation than lower levels
 comotherapy se guzarane vaale rogi echbivi ke punarskriyan ke khatre par hote hai
 The current view is that drugs that suppress immunity aid enhanced HBV replication while inhibiting cytotoxic t cell function in the liver
 2004 tak, ek anumaan ke anusaar 350 million echbivi sankramit vyakti duniya bhar main hai

 america kaa rashtri pustak puraskaar vijeta Kaushitaki Brahmanopanishad is the full name of Kaushitaki Upanishad
 yah ek rigvedic upanishad he
 The Kaushitaki Upanishad is part of the Kaushitaki Brahmin of the Rigveda
 isamen kul chaar adhyay hai
 This Upanishad highlights the worship of Jeevatma and Brahmaloka, Pranopasana, Agnihotra, Miscellaneous Worship, the glory of Pranaattva and the Chaitanya element existing in Sun, Moon, Electrical Cloud, Sky, Air, Fire, Water, Mirrors and Resonance
 ant main 'aatmatatva' ke swaroop or uski upasna se praapt fal par vichaar kiya gaya he
 In the first chapter, the Agnihotra and 'phalushruti' for 'brahm Gyan' are highlighted by the dialogues of the great grandson of Gautama Rishi and Garga Rishi
 jab mrityu ke uparant sadhak brahmalok pahunchataa hai, to uskaa saamana apsaraon or ek vicitra panlag par baithe brahmaji se hota he
 He talks to them
 is vaartalap ko 'paryank-vidya' bhi kehete hai
 Maharishi Chitra, the great grandson of the sage Garga, decides to perform the yagya and invites Arun's son Mahatma Uddālaka as the principal Ritvik, but Muni Uddālaka himself does not go and send his son तvetaketu to perform the yagna
 shwethaketu apane pita kii aagyaanusaar vahaan pahunchakar ek oonche asana par virajman hote hai
 Then the picture questions him - 'hey Gautamkumar! There is such a covered place in this world, where you can take me and keep it, or even there is such a completely separate and uniquely void position, knowing that you can establish me in the same world? aisa kahkar shwethaketu yajna kaa asana chhodkar chale gayi or apane pita se prashn kiya-'he pitashri! maharishi chitra ne jo prashn mujhase kiya he, uskaa uttar main kaise duun?' shwethaketu ne chitra kaa prashn apane pita ke saamne doharaa diya
 Then the sage Uddālaka said - ‘son! i do not even know the answer
 ham donon maharishi chitra kii yajyashala main chalakar va iskaa adhyayan karke hi is vidya ko praapt karenge
 'after that, both the father-son took the help of the famous Aruni Muni and went to Maharishi Chitra with curiosity and said that they have come to him for learning
 chitra ne kaha-'he gautam! aap brahmanon main ati poojaneey hai or brahmavidya ke adhikari he; kyonki mere paas aate hue aapke man main apni shreshthata kaa tanik-bhi abhimaan nahin he
 i will certainly make you understand this
 'maharishi chitra ne kaha-'he vipravar! jo vyakti agnihotradi satkaryon kaa anushthan karne vaale hai, ve sabhi is lok se chandralok, arthath swarglok kii ore gaman karte hai, lekin jo vyakti swargeey sukh ke prati aasakt hokar chandralok sweekaar kar letaa he, uske sabhi punya nasht ho jate hai or vah pun: is dharti par waapas aa girtaa he, arthath uskaa phir se punarjanm ho jaat he
 He cannot get salvation
 'maharishi chitra ke aisa kehane par gautam muni ne phir poocha-'he bhagwan! mujhe bataayen ki main koun hoon? mujhe is bhavasaagar se paar hone kaa vah upaay bataayen, jisase main samast bhav-bandhanon se mukt ho sakuun?' Maharishi Chitra said- 'O Gautam! The seeker going through the Devayana route is able to enter the 'brahmalok' through the six loks like Agnilok, Vayalok, Suryalok, Varunalok, Indralok and Prajapatilok respectively
 'brahmalok' ke pravesh dwaar par 'ar' naam kaa ek bada jalashay he
 This reservoir is directed by enemies such as work, anger, attachment etc
 yahaan pal-bhar kaa bhi ahankaar or kaam, krodh, lobh aadi kaa bandhan, sadhak ke sabhi punyon ko nasht kar daalata he
 This reservoir is the biggest obstacle in the attainment of 'ishta', but one who crosses it again reaches the bank of the holy Virja river
 uskaa samast shram or vriddhavastha, viraja nadi ke darshan maatr se hi dur ho jate hai
 Next comes a tree called 'ilai'
 yaheen par anek devataaon ke sundar upawanon, udyanon, baawali, coop, sarovar, nadi or jalashay aadi se yukt nagar he, jo viraja nadi or ardhachandrakaar parcote se ghira he
 All these appear to fascinate the mind again and again, but a seeker who does not indulge in them and moves forward, sees a huge shrine of Brahma Ji in front of him
 is devalayas kaa naam 'aparajita' he
 It is very difficult to conquer the Sun due to its bright colors
 isaki raksha megh, yajna se uplakshith vaayu tathaa akaash-swaroop indra evam prajapati dwaara kii jaati he, parantu jo unhen parajeet kar letaa he, vah brahmalok main pravesh kar jaataa he
 There, on the altar called 'vichakshana', in the midst of a huge splendid assembly-hall, Lord Almighty appears as an almighty soul sitting on a very beautiful throne
 vishwa janani amba or ambavayavi naamak apsaraayein unki seva main rat hai, jo brahmavetta sadhak kaa swaagat karti hai or use alankrita karke brahma ji ke sammukh upasthit karti hai
 'this Upanishad shows the way to reach Brahmaloka from the Devayana route by tying a very beautiful metaphor
 yaheen par rishi kahata he ki rath main baithkar yatra karne vaala purush, jis prakaar rath ke pahiyon ko daudte hue to dekhtaa he, parantu vah pahiyon kii gati ke bhoomi se hone vaale sanyog ko nahin dekh paata
 Similarly, a seeker who travels to Brahmaloka, sitting on a chariot, sees day and night, sees the movement of time, sees sin and virtue, but does not indulge in them
 vah unase dur rahakar hi 'brahm' ko praapt karata he
 Work, anger, greed, fascination and ego do not obstruct his path
 maharishi chitra aage bataate hai-'he gautam! brahmavetta ban sadhak apni sampoorn indriyon main brahmagandh, brahmaras, brahmatej, brahmayash tathaa brahmanad kaa anubhav karata he
 Then Brahma ji asks the Brahmist - 'who are you?' At that time, the question asked by Brahma ji should be answered by the Brahmandi in this way- is prakaar brahma ji ke sabhi prashnon kaa uttar dene ke uparant swayan brahma ji sadhak se kehete hai ki 'jal' aadi prasiddh paanch mahabhoot mere sthaan hai
 Therefore, my folk is also dominated by water etc
 tum mujhase abhinn mere upaask ho
 Therefore, this is also your world
 'is prakaar vah sadhak brahma kii 'jiti' or 'vyashti', donon ko praapt kar letaa he
 'maharishi Chitra overwhelmed Gautam Rishi thus preaching' Brahm Gyan '
 rishi gautam apane putr shwethaketu ke saath maharishi chitra ko pranaam karke waapas laut gayi
 This chapter highlights the worship of 'pranatattva' and the practical side of 'theosophy'
 iske atirikt apane paapon ko nasht karne ke liye 'suryopasna' putr kii kushal-mangal kaamana or suraksha ke liye, 'chandropasna,' achche swasthya ke liye 'somopasna,'moksh-prapti ke liye 'pranompasna' tathaa putr ko apane sampoorn jivan kaa daayitv-bhaar saunpte samay 'sampradaan karm' kaa bada hi sangopang varnan kiya he
 In the chapter on worship of nature, 'prana' is considered as the form of 'brahma'
 praan kii kalpana raja ke rup main kii gayi he
 'mana' is his messenger, 'vani' is his queen, 'chakshu' is his guardian minister, 'karnendriya' is the gatekeeper accepting the message
 praan ke aate hi samast indriyon kii seva praan-rupi raja ko swat: hi praapt ho jaati he
 The well-known Mahatma accepts dry arid 'life' as Brahma
 at: praan kii upasna hi isht siddhiyon ko dene vaali he
 Excellence in life, happiness, prosperity, fame, glory and knowledge can be done through pranopasana
 suryopasnakaushitaki rishi ne apane anubhav se suryopasna teen baar-praat:kaal, madhyahnkaal or sanykaal- karne kii baat kahi he
 He has said that in the morning, keep the Yajnopavit in the morning and keep it on the left shoulder
 phir jalpaatr ko teen baar shuddh jal se bharkar, udai hote hue surya ko arghya pradaan karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen—' virgosi papmanan me vriddhi
 'thus in the mid-day, remember Lord Bhaskar and chant this mantra -' ॐ Vriddhidhi in udvargosi papamanam
 ' isi prakaar sanykaal main, ast hote hue surya kii upasna karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen- ' sanwargosi papmanan me sanvruddhi
 In this way, by performing Suryopasana, all the sins of a person day and night are eradicated, the power to not commit sinful deeds is generated
 chandropasnamavasya main, jab surya pashchim bhaag main sthit ho tathaa chandramaa sushumna naamak rashmi main chandramaa sthit ho, tab is vidhi se chandropasna kerani chahie
 Also keep two green sprouts in the pot offering arghya
 tab arghya dete hue is mantra kaa uccharan karen-'yatte susiman hridayamadhi chandramsishritan tenamritatvasyeshane maahan pautramadyan rudam
 With this kind of prayer, the worshiper keeps the son from mourning and in the event of no son, he gets the son-jewel
 somopasanarishi ne somopasna ko swasth sharir kaa kaaran mana he
 He prays to Mon - 'O woman-like Mon! You attain development through the sunlight in the form of men
 tum sabhi ore se ann kii prapti main sahaayak bano
 Hey Mon! You are full of gentle qualities
 tumhaara divya ras surya ke tej ko praapt karke purush maatr ke liye atyant hitkaari ho jaataa he
 Confirm the men who have consumed this divine juice and be fully helpful in defeating all their enemies
 he som! tum aagney tej se prasannataa ko praapt karte hue, amritv kii prapti main sahyog pradaan karo or swayan apane yash ko swarglok main sthir karo
 Hey Mon! i follow your right hand and rotate my right arm again and again
 ' rishi ne som ko paanch mukh vaala prajapati kaha he
 His mouth is 'brahmin', the second face is 'kshatriya', the third face is 'eagle' bird, the fourth face is 'agni'
 or paanchvaan mukh tum 'swayan' ho
 In this way, after praying to Som, before touching the woman ready for conception, touch her heart and recite this Mantra - 'yeat Sumime Hridaye Hitmant: Prajapatau Manyehan Maa Tadvidwansen Ten Mahan Pautramadhan Rudam
 ' is prakaar kii gayi prarthana se sadhak ko kabhi putr shok nahi jhelana padataa
 The sage refers to the mother who feeds her milk to her children
 uske doodh main somras-jaisi rakshaatmak shakti vidyaman hoti he
 The child remains healthy with that only
 mata kaa doodh balak ke liye naiysargik prakriya he
 Resistance to nature leads to many terrible consequences
 moksh hetu pranopasanamoksh ke liye prantatva kii upasna ke sandarbh main, rishi ne ek sundar roopak dwaara praanon ke mahatv ko darshaya he
 At one time, all the gods etc
, subjugated by ego, started to dispute each other to prove their importance
 praan ke saath sabhi ne sharir se bahirgaman kar diya
 As he left, the body slept like a wood without consciousness
 'vaani' ne apana varchasv siddh karne ke liye sharir main akele hi pravesh kiya
 As soon as Vani entered, the body started speaking to Vani, but he could not get up from his place
 iske baad 'netrendriya' devtaa ne sharir main pravesh kiya
 Then he started speaking with speech and looking with eyes, but this time also he could not get up
 phir 'shrotendiy' devtaa ne sharir main pravesh kiya
 He started listening, speaking and seeing
 lekin is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa, nishcesht hi padaa rahaa
 Thereafter, the mind entered that body
 man ke dwaara vah sochane yogya to ho gaya, par is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa
 Then at the end 'prana' entered that body
 us prantatva ke pravesh karte hi vah sharir uthakar baith gaya
 With this, the importance of life became paramount, all other senses acknowledged the power of spiritual practice in salvation, salvation etc
 unhone janaa ki praanon ke dwaara hi amritv gun ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he or yah sharir upar uthakar swarglok kii ore ja saktaa he
 All the senses and senses of the body work through life
 at: praanon kii upasna dwaara hi brahm se sanyog kaa kaaran banataa he
 Only through life can one achieve the specific form of knowledge
 pita dwaara sampradaan-karm karnaa is adhyay main pita dwaara apane putr ko uttaradhikari banane kii prakriya kaa sangopang ullekh kiya gaya he
 The sage says that knowing that his last time has come, the father should be relieved of all his responsibilities and whatever he has, he should hand over to his son
 putr ko bhi apane pita dwaara chode gayi daayitv ko saharsha sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 The father should wear good clothes and call his son to him and say to him - 'O son! i give you my speech power, your soul, your eye, your ears, your taste, all your best deeds, your joys and sorrows, your copulatory power and kindness, your mobility, all your desires, your wisdom, your fame , Brahmatej and bestow my health and the power to digest food, etc
, or i covet within you
 ' pita dwaara aisa kehane par putr vinamrata se unhen sweekaar kare or apane baayen kandhe kii ore drushti karke haath se oot karke kahe-'pitashri! aap apni icchaanusaar kaamanayukta swarg ko tathaa vahaan ke samast bhogon ko praapt karen
 'after this, if the father is sick, then he can live with him by making or believing his son to be the master of the house or else abandon everything and leave the house to live a life of renunciation
 aisa pita uchit samay ke aane par divyalok ko gaman karne vaala hota he
 In fact, this is the correct rule of succession
 is adhyay main rishi ne praan, pragna or indriyon kaa vishad varnan karte hue unke parsparik sambandhon kaa vishleshan kiya he
 Dialogue-style has been used for this
 yahaan indra or divodas raja ke putr pratardan ke parsparik sanvaadon dwaara praan ko pragna kaa swaroop bataaya he or kaha he ki is pragna se hi lokhit sambhav he
 Once in the Devasur Sangram, Pratardan Swargalok, son of King Divodas, went to assist the Devatas
 vahaan unki adwitiya yudhkala evam shaury se prasann hokar indra ne unhen vardaan dena chaha tha
 On this, Pratardan said - 'hey Devraj! The best bridesmaid whom you consider to be the ultimate welfare for mankind, you should provide me any such best bridesmaid
 'pratardan kii baat sunakar devraj indra ne kaha-'rajan! is sansar main koi bhi aisa vyakti nahin he, jo dusron ke sukh ke liye var maangata ho
 You ask for a bridesmaid that is for you? ”on this, Pratidan refused to accept any groom
 raja pratardan ko satya kaa arudh dekhakar devraj indra ne kaha-'he rajan! tum mujhe hi, mere yatharth rup ko jaano? yahi maanav-jati ke liye shreshth vardaan he
 In this statement of Devraj, Pratardan recognized that Indra did not know how many astray Asuras and sages and punishments, but Indra's hair was not deterred due to being egoless and fruitless
 tab usne samajha ki nishkaam karm karte hue or ahankaar kaa sarvatha tyaag karte hue, jo jivan jiya jaataa he, vah maanav-kalyaan ke liye hi hota he
 Therefore, it is absolutely essential for a public welfare person to be selfless and selfless
 aisa vyakti hi indra, arthath pragna-rupi praan-tatva ke yatharth swaroop ko praptaj kar saktaa he or bade-se-bada paapakarm bhi use prabhavit nahin kar saktaa
 If a terrorist has to be killed to protect the divine instincts, then he also does not feel sin
 devraj indra ne pratardan ko upadesh dete hue kaha ki jo bhi mere satya swaroop ko pahchaan jaataa he, use kabhi paap nahin lagata; kyonki, 'main swayan hi pragna-swaroop praan hum
 'indra goes on to say that i am worshiped as an auspicious form with that soul and superior knowledge, worship me Indra, you age and nectar-form
 vah spasht karata he ki aayu hi praan he, praan hi aayu he or praan hi amritatatv he
 As long as there is life in this body, then there is age
 is prantatva ke dwaara hi sadhak duusare lok main jaakar amritatatva ke vishesh sukh ko praapt karata he
 a person who worships Indra in the form of 'age' and 'amrit', he attains Purnayu in this world and enjoys the pleasures of heaven
 sharir main praan kaa mahatva hi sarvopari he
 If any part of the body is destroyed while still alive, the body remains alive, but if the life is not there, it is impossible for the body to survive even for a moment
 kriya shakti kaa bodh karaane vaala praan hi he
 Prana itself gives the power to be the instinct in knowledge
 ise hi 'pragna-swaroop praan' athwa 'aatma' kaha gaya he
 Therefore, for the upliftment of life, this life should be worshiped in the form of wisdom
 sharir main pragna or praan, donon saath-saath nivas karte hai tathaa jeevatma ke saath milakar ek saath hi is sharir ko chhodte hai
 This is the philosophy of pranamaya parabrahma and this is science
 isi kii upasna jan-kalyaan kaa mukhya strot he
 In a dormant state, when a human is asleep, then all the senses and knowledge are absorbed in life
 lekin jab vah jaagta he, tab sabhi prakaar kaa gyaan, praan se nikalakar apni-apni indriyon main samaa jaataa he or sushupt indriyaan sajag ho jaati hai
 This is explained by the example of a dying person in the Upanishads
 ek vyakti, jo maranasann avasthaa main he, uski samast chetana shakti indriyon kaa saath chhodkar praan main samaa jaati he
 At that time he neither hears nor sees, nor speaks, has been able to move his hands and feet, nor does his brain work
 yahi sthiti dhyansth yogi kii hoti he
 But when that moribund person resurrects after getting rid of diseases or that meditation practitioner returns to a comfortable life again, then all his senses become aware again according to their nature
 man ke dwaara nirdeshit hone lagati hai
 Prana first awakens the mind
 vahi sampoorn indriyon ko niyantrit or aniyantrit karata he
 Mind is directly related to 'pragya' and Pragya is related to Prana
 is prakaar praan, pragna or indriyon kaa anyonyashrith sambandh he
 Pragnya is the intelligence and all senses are governed by the same
 sharir se unmukt hone vaala 'praan' jab utkraman karata he, tab vah us samay in sabhi indriyon-sahit hi utkraman karata he
 Vani abandons all names, nose of all smells, eye of all forms, ear of all sounds and mind of all meditative subjects
 at: sharir main praan hi vah pragna he or pragna hi vah praan he, jo ek saath is sharir main nivas karte hai
 All the senses of the body are operated by them
 pragna ke dwaara hi vah samast indriyon ke swabhaav ke anuroop anubhuti ko praapt karata he
 In the absence of wisdom, the existence of all becomes negligible
 praan athwa pragna ke bina kisi bhi rup, vishay athwa indriya kii siddhi nahin ho sakati
 Just as the chariot's names are dependent on the arrows and the chariot's navel, all senses of the same kind exist by wisdom
 yah pragna athwa praan hi paramatma kaa anandaswarup or ajar-amar rup he
 It neither gets growth by good work nor shrinks from bad work
 yah samdarshi he
 He is the ruler of all the worlds and lord of all
 yah praan hi hamaara aatma he
 Knowing this, the presence of God can be experienced
 is adhyay main gargy naamak brahman rishi or kaashi ke vidwaan raja ajatshatru ke madhya hue vaartalap ko aadhaar banaakar samvaad-style main brahmand kii vividh shaktiyon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he tathaa 'aatma' ko hi 'brahm' sweekaar kiya he
 The son of Balaka Rishi, who originated in Garga gotra, was famous as Garga Rishi
 ve chaaron vedon ke prakand vidwaan the
 Ushinar Pradesh was his residence
 ve praaia: desh ke vibhinn pradeshon main bhraman karte rahete the
 Sometimes in Matsya country, sometimes he used to reach to live in kuru-panchal
 ek baar ve ghoomte-ghoomte kaashi ke vidwaan raja ajatshatru ke dabaar main pahunche
 There he spoke to the king in a very egotistical voice - 'O Rajan! i will teach you 'brahmatattva'
 ' gargy rishi ke aisa kehane par kaashi naresh ajatshatru ne kaha-'he vipravar! aapke is upadesh ke liye main aapako ek sahastra uttam kul vaali guaen pradaan karuunga
 i am happy that till now Mithila Naresh Janak was the name of the listener and donator of theology
 aaj aapane hamaare paas aakar videh raaj janak kii bhaanti hamaara gaurav badhaayaa he
 While preaching "brahmattattva", this kind of conversation took place between Rishi Gargya and Ajatshatru - Rishi Gargya - "O Rajan! The God who is situated in this sunrise, i practice the same with my intellect
 'ajatshatru—'he brahman! aisa nahin he
 This white robed Sun is the greatest of all
 yah sabase ucch sthiti main kendrit, sabakaa sheesh he
 The man who worships this great man in this way, he reaches the highest position
 'rishi gargy-'he rajan! chandra mandal main jo yah antaryami viraat purush he, main use brahmroop main maanakar uski upasna karata hum
 'ajatashatru-' o Vipravar! It's not like this
 yah to som raja he or ann kii aatma bhi yahi he
 i worship this in the same way
 jo bhi is prakaar isaki upasna karata he, vah nishciya hi ann kii aatma ho jaati he tathaa dhan dhaany se bhar jaataa he
 'sage Gargya -' o Rajan! i am a worshiper of this interim giant Virabh Parrahm under the Electricity Board
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa nahin he
 i worship this electricity as 'soul of light'
 jo bhi is prakaar isaki upasna karata he, vah swayan prakaash-swaroop 'aatma' ho jaataa he
 'rishi Gargi-' o Rajan! i consider that transcendental God existing as a roar in the cloud
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa na kahen
 i worship this superior element only by understanding the soul of the word
 jo is prakaar isaki upasna karata he, vah swayan hi shabd kii aatma ke rup main parinat ho jaataa he
 'sage Gargya again said -' o Rajan! i worship the eminent Parabrahma Parmeshwar in the heavens as the imperishable Brahman
 'ajatshatru ne uttar diya-'he vipravar! main is vishay main kuch nahin kahana chahta
 This complete, trend-less Brahman is greater than all
 avashya hi main isi rup main isaki upasna karata hum
 One who worships such a divine Brahman, he becomes devoid of all beings
 samay se purv uski mrityu nahin hoti
 Similarly, while advancing the conversation, the sage Gargya called the Virat Purush in the atmosphere Brahm, but Ajatashatru called him Vaikuntha with great opulence of Indra, where the frustrations are destroyed and he is always undefeated
 uske baad rishi ne agni mandal main sthit viraat purush ko, jalmandal main upasthit viraat purush ko, darpan main pratibimbit viraat purush ko, pratidhwani main sthit dhwani ko, gatisheel viraat purush ke peeche uthne vaale dhvanyatmak shabd ko, sharirdhari kii chaaya ko, sharir main sthit viraat purush ko, pragna se yukt praan-swaroop aatma ko, daahine netra main sthit viraat purush ko, baayen netra main sthit viraat purush ko avinashi brahm ke rup main upasthit karke, uski upasna karne kii baat kahi
 But Ajatashatru, by denying all, respectively, the fire, tolerating the attack of others, 'vishasahi', the person with the name of Brahma in the water, the image of the image, the resonance lacking motion, the phonetic word 'life', the body's shadow
 The form of death, the form of Prajapati to the great man in the body, the form of Yama to the soul with wisdom, the name to the man situated in the right eye, the fire Central and light of spirit, true man in the left eye, power and said high spirit and spoke to worship in the same way
 ajatshatru kii baat sunakar gargy rishi maun ho gayi or unhone ajatshatru ko apana guru sweekaar kar liya, parantu kshatriya hone ke kaaran ajatshatru ne brahman gargy ko shishy bananaa sweekaar nahin kiya
 Yes, in solitude, he made them aware of Brahma
 ve unhen lekar ek sote hue vyakti ke paas gayi or use anek naamon se pukaar kar jagaane kaa praytn kiya, parantu jab vah nahin jaagaa, to ajatshatru ne chadi se chot markar use uthaaya
 On his waking Ajatashatru said to sage Gargya - 'O Vipravar! Where did this person sleep unconscious like this and in which state was it and now after waking up, where has it come? ' The sage Gargya could not understand this secret, so King Ajatashatru said again - 'rishiwar! The place where this man used to sleep is life-like heart
 vahaan 'hita' naam kii prasiddh naadee he
 Through him, the heart extends to the entire pulse, which is even finer than the thousandth part of the hair
 in naadiyon main purush sote samay sthit rahata he
 The 'prana' situated in the heart of this sleeping man is possible with all the senses
 yah praan hi 'aatma' kaa khol he
 This intelligent soul sits in this shell in a subtle way, like a sword in a wooden sheath
 purush ke jaagane par yah 'aatma' sampoorn 'prantatva' ko sakriy kar detii he
 Then all the senses of that 'witness-form soul' follow like a permitted servant
 'isi 'aatma' ko jaanane vaala gyani, indra kii bhaanti apane sabhi shatru asuron athwa paapon ko nasht karke triloki kaa sarvshereshth pad praapt karata he
 Therefore, to know the 'soul', renunciation of ego is absolutely necessary
 tabhi vah apane paapon kon nasht kar saktaa he
