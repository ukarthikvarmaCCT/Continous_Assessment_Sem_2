 mahabharat ke anusaar is yuddh main bharat ke praayah sabhi janapadon ne bhaag liya tha
 According to Mahabharata and other Vedic literature, it was the largest war in the history of Vedic period in ancient India
 is yuddh main lakhon kshatriya yoddha maare gayi jiske parinamswaroop vaidic samskruti tathaa sabhyataa kaa patan ho gaya tha
 Apart from kings from all over India, Kshatriya heroes from many other countries also participated in this war and all the heroes gained momentum
 is yuddh ke parinamswarup bharat main gyaan or vigyaan donon ke saath-saath vir kshatriyon kaa abhaav ho gaya
 In a way, the Vedic culture and civilization which was at the peak of development was abruptly destroyed
 pracheen bharat kii svarnim vaidic sabhyataa is yuddh kii samaapti ke saath hi samaapt ho gayi
 This great war was described by the great sage and philosopher of the time, Lord Ved Vyasa, in his epic Mahabharata, which was remembered by singing and listening throughout India for millennia

 Many remains associated with the Mahabharata period have been found in Purana Qila in Delhi

 The main reason for the Mahabharata war was the high ambitions of the Kauravas and the infatuation of Dhritarashtra's son
 kaurav or pandav aapas main sahodar bhai the
 Vedavyas ji was born to Niagara through the womb of Vichitravirya, Dhritarashtra from the womb of Ambika and Pandu were born from the womb of Ambalika
 dhritarashtra ne gandhari ke garbh se sau putron ko janm diya, unamem duryodhana sabase bada tha
 Pandu had five sons like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva etc
 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was ruled in his place, so that Dhritarashtra always had a grudge against Pandu and his sons
 yah dwesh duryodhana ke rup me faleebhoot hua or shakuni ne is aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya
 At Shakuni's behest, Duryodhana made many conspiracies from childhood to Lakshgriha
 parantu har baar wo vifal rahaa
 When Yudhishthira was made the crown prince when he was young, he tried to kill him by sending him to Lakshagriha, but the Pandavas escaped
 pandavon kii anupasthiti main dhritarashtra ne duryodhana ko yuvaraj bana diya parantu jab pandavon ne vaapis aakar apana rajya vaapis maanga to unhen rajya ke naam par khandahar rupi khandav van diya gaya
 At Dhritarashtra's request, Yudhishthira accepted this proposal to avoid the crisis of civil war
 pandavon ne shrikrishna kii sahaayta se indra kii amaravati puri jitani bhavy nagari indraprastha kaa nirmaan kiya
 The Pandavas collected abundant gems and money and performed the Rajasuya Yajna
 duryodhana pandavon kii unnati dekh nahin paaya or shakuni ke sahyog se dyut main chhal se yudhisthir se uskaa sara rajya jeet liya or kuru rajya sabha main draupadi ko nirvastr karne kaa prayaas kar use apamaanit kiya
 Probably the seeds of the war of Mahabharata had fallen on this day
 antatah punah dyut main harkar pandavon ko 12 varsho ko gyaatvaas or 1 varsh kaa agyatavaas sweekaar karnaa padaa
 But even after fulfilling this condition, the Kauravas refused to give the Pandavas their kingdom
 to pandavon ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa, parantu shrikrishna ne yuddh rokane kaa har sambhav prayaas karne kaa suzav diya
 Then Sri Krishna went to the Kurujya Sabha on behalf of the Pandavas as a peacemaker and there, Krishna offered Duryodhana to stop the war by giving only five villages to the Pandavas
 parantu jab duryodhana ne pandavon ko sui kii nonk jitani bhi bhoomi dene se manaa kar diya to antatah yudhisthir ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa
 In this way, the Kauravas collected 11 Akshauhini and the Pandavas collected 7 Akshauhini army
 yuddh kii taiyaariyaan purna karne ke baad kaurav or pandav donon dal kurukshetra pahunche, jahaan yah bhayankar yuddh ladaa gaya kurukshetra ke us bhayanak or ghamaasan sanhaarak yuddh kaa anumaan mahabharat ke bhishma parv main diye ek shloke se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki Bhrata bharatrantra swatriyaan ma matulah॥ 12 varshon ke gyaatvaas or 1 varsh ke agyatavaas kii shart puri karne par bhi jab kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya to pandavon ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa
 But Shri Krishna said that this war can cause destruction of the entire world civilization, so he suggested to make every effort to stop the war
 shrikrishna ne kaha ki duryodhana ko ek antim avasar avashya dena chahie, isaliye shrikrishna pandavon kii taraf se kururajya sabha main shantidoot banakar gayi or duryodhana se pandavon ke saamne keval paanch gaanv dekar yuddh taalane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 When Duryodhana refused to give the Pandavas as much land as the needle point, Sri Krishna explained to him that due to this persistence of Duryodhana, many innocent people along with his descendants and companions would have to sacrifice war
 is baat krodhit hokar duryodhana ne shrikrishna ko bandi banane kii koshish kii parantu shrikrishna maaya kaa prayog karke sabko apane viraat rup se bhaybheet kar vahaan se chale gayi
 After this Yudhishthira had to be forced to fight
 usee samay bhagwaan vedavyas ne dhritarashtra ke paas jaakar kaha ki tumhaare putron ne samast gurujanon kii baton kii avhelnaa karke antatah mahavinashkari yuddh ko khadaa hi kar diya
 On requesting to know the information of Dhritarashtra war, Ved Vyas told him that if you want to see this great war, then i can give you divine vision
 is par dhritarashtra ne kaha ki isamen mere hi kul kaa vinaash hona he, isaliye main is yuddh apni aankhon se nahin dekhuungaa
 So please make such a arrangement that i keep getting news of this war
 yah sunakar vedavyas ji ne sanjay ko bulaakar use divya drushti de di or kaha, “he dhritarashtra! maine sanjay ko divya drushti pradaan kar diya he
 There will be no such thing in the entire war zone which is hidden from it
 yah tumhen is mahayuddh kaa sara vrittant sunaayegaa
 After saying this, Ved Vyas went away
 jab yah nishchit ho gaya ki yuddh to hoga hi, to donon pakshon ne yuddh ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar deen
 Duryodhana was preparing for war for the last 13 years, he got education of mace war from Balram ji and with hard work and practice, he became better than Bhima in fighting mace war
 shakuni ne in varshon me kii vishwa ke adhiktar janapadon ko apni taraf kar liya
 Duryodhana wanted to make Karna the commander of his army, but on Shakuni's persuasion, Duryodhana made Pithama Bhishma the commander of his army, due to which many districts of India and the world were in favor of Duryodhana
 pandavon kii taraf keval vahi janapad the jo dharm or shrikrishna ke paksh me the
 According to Mahabharata, Kurujaya was the largest and powerful district in the world during the Mahabharata period
 vishwa ke sabhi janapad kururajya se kabhi yuddh karne kii bhul nahin karte the evam sauhardpurn sambandh banaae rakhte the
 Therefore, all the districts agreed to help them in the war with the greed of benefiting by the Kurus
 pandavon or kauravon dwaara yadavon se sahaayta maangane par shrikrishna ne pehle to yuddh main shastr na uthaane kii pratigya kii or phir kaha ki "ek taraf main akelaa or duusari taraf meri ek akshuhinee narayani sena", ab arjuna va duryodhana ko inamen se ek kaa chunaav karnaa tha
 Arjuna chose Shri Krishna, then Shri Krishna gave one of his Akshohini army to Duryodhana and himself accepted to be the charioteer of Arjuna
 is prakaar kauravon ne 11 akshuhinee tathaa pandavon ne 7 akshuhinee sena ekatrit kar lee
 Then Krishna met Karna and explained to him that he was the brother of the Pandavas, so he should fight on behalf of the Pandavas, but Karna did not leave the Kauravas with Duryodhana's debt and friendship
 iske baad kunti ke vinati karne par karn ne arjuna ko chhodkar uske shesh chaar putron ko avasar praapt hone par bhi na maarane kaa vachan diya
 Here, Indra too made a brahmin of the Brahmin and took his armor and helix from Karna
 jisase karn kii shakti kam ho gayi or pandavon kaa utsaah bad gaya kyonki us abhedya kavach ke kaaran karn ko kisi bhi divyastra se maaraa nahin ja saktaa tha
 The Pandavas and Kauravas carried out 7 and 11 divisions of their army respectively at Akshauhini
 ek akshuhinee main 21, 870 rath, 21, 870 hathi, 65, 610 savaar or 1,09,350 paidal sainik hote hai
 It used to be the measurement of the army in ancient India
 har rath main chaar ghode or unka sarathi hota he har hathi par uskaa hathivan baithta he or uske peeche uskaa sahaayak jo kursi ke peeche se hathi ko ankush lagaataa he, kursi main uskaa maalik dhanush-baan se sajjit hota he or uske saath uske do saathi hote hai jo bhaale phenkate hai tadnusaar jo log rathon or haathiyon par savaar hote hai unki sankhya 2, 84, 323 hoti hai ek akshuhinee sena main samast jeevadhariyon- haathiyon, ghodon or manushyon-kii kul sankhya 6, 34, 243 hoti hai, atah 18 akshuhinee sena main samast jeevadhariyon- haathiyon, ghodon or manushyon-kii kul sankhya 1, 14, 16, 374 hogi

 Before the war, Arjun asks Shri Krishna to take his chariot to the middle of both the armies so that he can see which of the warriors he has to face in the war
 jab arjuna yuddh kshetra main apane guru dron, pitamah bhishma evam anya sambandhiyon ko dekhtaa he to vah bahut shokgrast evam udhaas ho jaataa he
 He tells Shri Krishna that those for whom we want to get all this Rajbhog, they are standing here in our opposition to get the same Rajbhog in this war zone, what will we do by getting Raj after killing them

 Therefore, probably in the beginning of human society, either the entire community or a group of husband, wife and children was the family
 maanav vaigyanikon ko koi aisa samaaj nahin mila jahaan vivaah sambandh parivaar ke andar hi hote hon, at: pitristhaneey parivaar main patni ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main pati ko atirikt sadsyta pradaan kii jaati he

 Ekadashi fasting holds an important place in Hinduism
 prayek varsh choubees ekadashiyaan hoti hai
 When Adhikamas or Malamas comes, then their number increases to 26
 jyeshtha maas kii shukla paksh kii ekadshi ko nirjala ekadshi kehete he is vrath me pani kaa pinaa varjit he isiliye is nirjala ekadshi kehete he
 When the omniscient Ved Vyas pledged the Ekadashi fasting to the Pandavas to give the four Purusharths - Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha, Mahabali Bhima requested - Father! You have spoken of fasting for one day per side
 main to ek din kya ek samay bhi bhojan ke bagaiyr nahin rah saktaa- mere pet main 'vruk' naam kii jo agni he, use shant rakhane ke liye mujhe kai logon ke baraabar or kai baar bhojan karnaa padataa he
 So will i be deprived of virtuous things like Ekadashi due to my hunger? pitamah ne bhim kii samasya kaa nidaan karte or unka manobal badhaate hue kaha- nahin kuntinandan, dharm kii yahi to visheshta he ki vah sabko dhaaran hi nahin karata, sabake yogya saadhan vrath-niyamon kii badi sahaj or lacheelee vyavastha bhi uplabdh karwaata he
 Therefore, you fast for only one Ekadashi named Nirjala of Shukla Paksha of Jyeshtha month and you will get the fruits of all the Ekadashis of the year
 nihsandeh tum is lok main sukh, yash or praptavya praapt kar moksh laabh praapt karoge
 On such assurance, Vrikodar Bhimsen too agreed to fast this Ekadashi
 isliye varsh bhar kii ekadashiyon kaa punya laabh dene vaali is shreshth nirjala ekadshi ko lok main pandav ekadshi yaa bhimseni ekadshi bhi kaha jaataa he
 On this day one who keeps himself waterless and donates a pot full of pure water to a Brahmin or a needy person with this mantra
 ek baar maharishi vyas pandavo ke yahan padhaare
 Bhima said to Maharishi Vyas, God! Yudhishthra, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, Mata Kunti and Draupadi all fast on Ekadashi and ask me to keep the fast, but i cannot live without eating, so tell me any such fast by avoiding the pain of being restless on twenty-four Ekadashis
 Which i do not have any special inconvenience to do and i also get the fruits of everything
 maharishi vyas jaanate the ki bhim ke udar main brik naamak agni he isliye adhik maatra main bhojan karne par bha uski bhukh shant nahi hoti he maharishi ne bhim se kaha tum jyeshtha shukla ekadshi kaa vrath rakhaa karo
 In this fast, drinking water in bathing achman is not to blame, this fast will also benefit the virtue of other twenty-three Ekadashis
 Follow this fast for life
 When he became insensible, the Pandavas made Gajajal, Tulsi Charanamrit Prasad, make him smile
 isliye ise bhimsen ekadshi bhi kehete hai
 Both men and women should do this fast

 Ambedkar put his political vision in front of the world during the first round table conference on 8 August 1930 in London, according to which the protection of the exploited class is in its independence from both the government and the Congress
 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The announcement of the Communal Award was the result of discussions at the Round Table Conference
 is samjhaute ke tahat ambedkar dwaara uthaai gai rajnatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ko maanate hue pruthak nirvaachika main dalit varg ko do voton kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya
 In 1942, Ambedkar rejected this agreement, 'state of Myanority' has also expressed Poona Pact's displeasure in this book

 isamen unhone muslim lig kii musalamaanon ke liye ek alag desh pakistan kii maang kii aalochana kii
 It also argued that Hindus should accept Muslims from Pakistan
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi
 "what Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables?" With this book, Ambedkar sharpened his attacks on both Gandhi and the Congress, accusing them of hypocrisy

 which is a cruel tactic to enslave and suppress humanity and its proper name will be slander
 ek sabhyataa ke bare me or kya kaha ja saktaa he jisane logon ke ek bahut bade varg ko viksit kiya jise


 ek maanav se hin samajha gaya or jiskaa sparsh maatr pradooshan failaane kaa paryaapt kaaran he? Ambedkar was also a great critic of the practices of Islam in South Asia
 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims
 unhone likhaa ki muslim samaaj me to hindu samaaj se bhi kahi adhik saamaajik buraaiyaan he or musalmaan unhen " bhaichaare " jaise naram shabdon ke prayog se chhupate hai
 He also criticized the oppressive curtain practice of oppression of women in Muslim society as well as the discrimination against the Arzal classes by Muslims who were considered "lower class"
 unhone kaha haalaanki pardaa hinduon me bhi hota he par use dharmik manyata keval musalamaanon ne di he
 He criticized bigotry in Islam due to which the society has become very fanatical due to the lack of literate adherence to the laws of Islam and it is very difficult to change it
 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa
 Buddhism teaches wisdom, compassion and equity
 unka kahana tha ki manushya inhen baton ko shubh tathaa aanandit jivan ke liye chahta he
 God and soul cannot save society
 ambedkar ke anusaar sachcha dharm wo hi he jiskaa kendra manushya tathaa naitikta ho, vigyaan athwa bauddhik tatv par aadhaarit ho, na ki dharm kaa kendra ishwar, aatma kii mukti or moksh
 At the same time, he said that the work of religion should be to rebuild the world and not to explain its origin and end
 vah janatantric samaaj vyavastha ke pakshdhar the, kyonki unka maananaa tha aisi sthiti main dharm maanav jivan kaa maardarshak ban saktaa he
 He got all these things in the only Buddhism
 gandhi va congress kii katu aalochana ke baavjood ambedkar kii pratishtha ek adwitiya vidwaan or vidhivetta kii thi jiske kaaran jab, 15 agast 1947 main bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad, congress ke netritv vaali nai sarkaar astitv main ai to usne ambedkar ko desh ke pehle kaanoon evam nyaay mantri ke rup main seva karne ke liye aamantrit kiya, jise unhone sweekaar kar liya
 On 29 August 1947, Ambedkar was appointed to the post of Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution for the creation of the new Constitution of independent India
 is kaary main ambedkar kaa shuruaati buddha sangh ritiyon or anya buddha granthon kaa adhyayan bhi kaam aayaa
 Granville Austin described the Indian Constitution prepared by Ambedkar as 'the first and most important social document'
 'bharat ke adhikansh sanvaidhanik praavdhaan yaa to saamaajik kranti ke uddeshy ko aage badhaane yaa isaki uplabdhi ke liye jaruri sthitiyon kii sthapana karke is kranti ko badhaava dene ke prayaas main sidhe pahunche hai
 ' ambedkar dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye samvidhan ke paath main vyaktigat nagarikon ke liye naagarik swatantraaa kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ke liye sanvaidhanik guarantee or suraksha pradaan kii gai he, jisamen dharm kii aazaadee, chuaachhut ko khatm karnaa, or bhedbhaav ke sabhi roopon kaa ulanghan karnaa shaamil he
 Ambedkar argued for comprehensive economic and social rights for women, and won the support of the assembly to introduce the system of reservation of jobs in civil services, schools and colleges for members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, Which was affirmative action
 bharat ke saansadon ne in upayon ke madhyam se bharat kii niraashajanak kakshaon ke liye saamaajik-aarthik asamantaaon or avasaron kii kami ko khatm karne kii ummid kii
 The constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949
