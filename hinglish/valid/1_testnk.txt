 The measurement of an egg depends mainly on the dealings of the egg laying bird, but it is not necessary that the ratio is always the same
 iske do kaaran hai : The size of the hen's egg is often the same size as the eggs of other birds
 anda ek disha main lanbaa hota he or uskaa ek chor golakaar or doosraa chor thodaa nukila hota he
 The eggs do not roll easily because they are round at one end and pointed at the other end

 Birds incubate eggs with great dedication, keeping them warm with their wings and protecting them: adhikansh jatiyon main nar or maadaa donon hi andsevan kaa kaary karte hai, bhale hi andey sene kaa kaary ek thodaa karata he to doosraa adhik
 Sometimes the female incubates eggs during the day and the male at night

 Males and females of any caste continue to come in turn

 It is often seen that even after the eggs are spoiled or lifeless, the female keeps on incubating them for a long period

 They are alert and playful from the beginning and can run or swim
 haan, yadi inhen chhedaa na jaay to janm ke pashchaat kuch ghanton tak ye shant pade rahanaa pasand karenge
 From the very beginning, they begin to feed themselves

 By making various excuses in child protection, these birds also surprise the visitor
 bahudhaa ye use dekhakar is prakaar langadaane lagate hai, maano kisi shikari dwaara ghayal kar die gaye hon
 Enemy hunters, Badikhas, Schwans, Shrigaladi, when they chase them with the hope of catching them, they go out of their way by dodging and then fly away suddenly

 Sparrows are also very aware of throwing dust in the eyes of others

 Wolf is a fictional character, one of the leading heroes of Indian comics publisher Raj Comics
 bhediya kii rachana dhiraj verma ne disambar 1993 ke dinon main kii thi
 In 1997, the comics of Kobi and Wolf were published by Digital Colors for the first time in India
 takreeban pachaas hajaar saal purv, vulphano naamak ek ganraajya hua karata tha, jiske nivasee behad viksit prajati ke bhediya-maanav rahaa karte the, jo shaktishaalee hone saath dopaaye chalate bhi the
 Their king, Wolfa, was also a wolf-human, who falls in love with Princess Survaya, a human damsel
 vah maanav ganraajya konkani kii rajkumaari thi
 In spite of all the instructions of his Gururaj Bhatiki, Wolfa marries Survaya on the strength of the magical captivating garland and thus the couple gets Kobi
 pachaas varsh guzarate he or sanyogvash ek durghatana main kobi par laga vah shaap mitata he or swayan ko assam ke jangal main paata he
 Then he starts a new life called "wolf"
 ab bhediya kii pahchaan vishaal kad ke saath ghaney aayal, lambii poonch or chamakdaar ankhon se janaa jaataa
 He would very much protect the forest dwellers and in return the forest dwellers considered him a wolf-god
 sabakaa madadgaar or aparaadhiyon ke bich kaal ke taur par log use "jangal kaa zallaad" ke naam se pukaarte
 The wolf is his master, Bhatiki, who teaches him how to fight
 phir bhaatiki do bhaagon main bhediya ko "kobi" or "bhediya" main vibhajit karata he
 Bhatiki orders his disciple Kobi to return to Wolfano
 magar unki yah cheshtaa asafal hoti he
 Meanwhile, both the human part wolf and the animal part Kobi try to marry Jane, in which no one agrees to leave the forest
 in 10 saalon main kobi assam ke jangalon main nivas karte hue, apane ilaake ko kai khataron se bachaata he, magar kai baar apni morrkhtaa ke chalate musiibat main faste bhi he
 Despite being almost the same body part of a wolf and a coby, the personalities are completely different in nature
 jahaan kobi jaahil, murkh or ugr swabhaav kaa he to vahiin bhediya vyaavhaarik taur par paripakv evam budhimaan he
 The tribals respect the wolf and consider him their protector, while trying to avoid becoming a partisan of Kobi's anger or anger, although at times Kobi would have avoided trouble in the jungle, but only on his own terms
 shaareerik sanrachana :lambaai- 8'0bhaar- 154 kg
shaareerik sanrachana :lambaai- 8'0bhaar- 138 kg
shaareerik sanrachana :lambaai - 6'6bhaar- 122 kg
 Coby can increase the length of his wonderful tail as he wishes, and he also uses it as a powerful weapon
 vahiin atyant khatarnaak paristhitiyon main vah apane bhediya dev kaa aahvaan karata he, jahaan uski "madad" swaroop ek ghaatak gada prakat hote hi vah virodhiyon ke parakhche uda daalata he
 Whenever Kobi calls upon a wolf army of help, the whole area is covered in a moment
 ye bhedie bhi use apana dev maanate tathaa use puujate
 Coby has his "wolf-faced plaque" that gives him the strength to recover, but not immediately
 asal main uske paas aisi teen divya aabhushan he jo uski shaktiyon kaa strot hai; ek kanthhaar, 2 kalaiyon ke kade ke jode or ek bhediya mukh pattica
 The wolf is a fierce warrior who, like the original Coby, possesses inherited dueling skills
 bhediya kai pracheen kaushal tathaa yudhkala kaa jaankaar he or usne isi bal par kobi ko kai baar haraaya bhi he
 We can see obvious abnormalities in Coby and Wolf
 bhediya behad budhimaan, vyaavhaar kushal evam maanviya gunon se paripurna he to kobi apni pashu buddhi, uddandata, aakraamak or gussell swabhaav ke kaaran kukhyat he
 Despite both, Gururaj Bhatiki specializes in teaching duality
 apane puure jivan bhediya or kobi kai gaiyr kanoonee taskaron, shikari evam van mafia se bhidate rahen he
 Some of his major rivals and enemies, which include Elephanto, Tantanna, Andhadhundh, Kaigula, Kalnami, Pratal, Eclipse, King Luna and Sniper

 Jason Snell of Macworld praised its portability but commented that "whether the macbook Air is a product of buyable value, its decision can be answered with a question: How much are you willing to compromise?" " mcbuk air kii peshkash ek televijan vigyaapan ke saath kii gayi thi jisamen isaki patali dizin par jor diya gaya tha
 In the ad, one hand opens a Manila envelope and slides out a macbook Air, then opens it to wake up from sleep

 a more mature manufacturing process has to be thanked thanks to the second-generation macbook Air's CPU being the same as the first-generation macbook Air series since late 2008, but it performs better on load, as the first-generation chips significantly Runs faster, which requires the processor to be opened in order to avoid overheating, which further reduces functionality Comes up

 Its effect can be seen on CPU temperatures that become at least 150 ° F, which worsen with higher temperatures
 appal ne samasya ke nidaan ke liye march 2008 ke prarambh main ek software apadet jari kiya tha jiske mishrit parinaam aaye the: aisa lagata he ki 1 sipiu kor ke niskriy hone ko thik kar liya gaya tha; haalanki kam se kam kuch upyogkartaaon ke liye ranve karnel kii samasya abhi bhi bani hui he
 This problem worsens further in system-intensive tasks such as video playback or video chatting

 In the texts of 1900-1800 years before Christ, nuskha used on animal is found

 ek network hub yaa ripeter hub multiple twisted peyar yaa fibre optic ethernet upkarnon ko saath jodne ke liye ek upkaran he jisase ve ek single network segment ke rup main kaary karte hai
 Hubs operate in the physical layer of the OSI model
 is prakaar upkaran multiport ripeter kaa ek rup he
 Repeater hubs identify collisions and send a jam signal to all ports when a collision is detected
 hub bhi aksar ek BNC or / yaa AUI conector ke saath 10BASE2 yaa 10BASE5 network kshetron se sambandh banane ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Network switches have largely rendered the hub obsolete due to low cost availability, but they are still seen in older machines and highly specialized applications
 network hub ek saral prasaaran upkaran he
 Hubs do not manage any traffic coming towards them and the packet coming from any port is transmitted to all other ports
 chunki har packet anya sabhi port ke madhyam se baahar bheja ja rahaa he, natijatan packets main takaraav hota he jisase yatayaat ke nirbaadh pravaah main baadha utpann hoti he
 The need to find a collision by the host limits the number of hubs and the entire size of the network
 10 Mbit / network ke liye, kinhi bhi do antim steshnon ke bich 5 khandon tak kii anumati he
 For 100 Mbit / s network this limit is reduced to 3 segments between any two end stations and they are also allowed only if the hubs are of low delay type
 kuch hub main stack port hote hai jo unhen is tarah se jodate hai jo ethernet cabel kii saadhaaran shrankhla ke mukaable or zyada hub jodne kii anumati dete hai, lekin phir bhi, ek bade fast ethernet network main hub kii shrankhla seemaa se bachane ke liye swichon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Most hubs detect specific problems such as excessive collisions on individual ports and partitioning of the port to separate it from the shared medium
 is prakaar, hub aadhaarit ethernet saamanytah us jagah ko-eksal cabel ethernet ke mukaable zyada majboot hote hai jahaan ek galat upkaran takaraav dwaara puure domen ko aksham kar saktaa he
 Even if there is no automatic segmentation, an intelligent hub easily troubleshoots the problem because the status light can point to the source of the potential problem or, as a last resort, compared to the equipment co-axle cable Can be easily separated from a hub over time
 ve adhik shakhaon vaali badi cabel se bhi samasya nivaaran kaa boj hataate hai
 Hubs are classified as Layer 1 devices in the OSI model
 physical parat main, hub parishkrut netwarking ke raste main kuch sahaayta kar sakate hai
 Hubs do not read any data passing through them and do not know their source or destination
 multah, ek hub keval aane vaale packets praapt karata he, shaayad bijli ke sanket badhaata he or network ke sabhi upkarnon par in packets kaa prasaaran karata he - jisamen vah upkaran bhi shaamil he jiske dwaara mul rup se packet bheja gaya tha
 Technically three different types of hubs exist: 1
 niskriy 2
 sakriy 
 3
 budhimaan or vah sab bhi karata he jo ki ek sakriy hub karata he)
 Passive hubs do not amplify the electrical signal of incoming packets before transmitting them outside the network
 Active centers, on the other hand, process this amplification, as do a variety of dedicated network devices called repeaters
 ek or, jo aam taur par prachlit nahin he, cancentrator ko ek niskriy hub or multiport ripeter ko ek sakriy hub ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Intelligent hubs add additional features to an active hub that is of particular importance to businesses
 ek budhimaan hub aamtaur par stack kiya ja saktaa he 
 yah aam taur par aasaan network prabandhan protocol or abhaasi lain ke madhyam se remote prabandhan kshamtaaon kaa samarthan bhi karata he
 Historically, the main reason for buying hubs rather than buying switches was their price
 mote taur par swichon ke mulya main katautee se is samasya ko samaapt kar diya gaya he, lekin vishesh paristhitiyon main hub abhi bhi upyogi ho sakate hai: 1647 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 1647 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar
 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 1647 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he

 yah thik he ki vishwa main lohas padaarthon kaa utpaadan hi sarvaadhik he or ye anya dhaatuon kii tulana main saste padate hai, parantu aaj ke vaigyanik yug main bahut se aise upyog he jahaan loh padaarthon kaa prayog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Non-ferrous metals or their alloys are used at such places
 aloh dhaatuon main anekanek dhaatu sammilit hai, jinamein tamra, aluminium, swarna, rajat, sisa, jasta, vang, nikal, manganeez ityadi pramukh hai
 The metallurgy of these metals is called non-metallic
 inamen se mahatvapurn kuchhek neeche di jaati hai
 In the modern era, aluminum is becoming a niche in non-ferrous metals
 aadhunik vimaanon kaa pradurbhaav aluminium ke kaaran hi sambhav ho sakaa
 Now, the use of this metal is also increasing in automobile and electrical industries
 yadhyapi prithvi ke dharaatal main aluminium dhaatu kii bahulata he, phir bhi iskaa pramukh ayask 'boxite' he jisase aluminium kaa vyapaarik utpaadan hota he
 It is hydrated aluminum oxide, in which silica, iron-oxide, titanium-oxide, etc
, exist as impurities
 adikaal se hi bharat main swarna dhaatu kaa prachlan rahaa he, isliye yah maananaa padataa he ki us samay main bhi log swarna utpaadan kii vidhiyon se avgat the
 Today, the basis of gold metallurgy has become more scientific and mainly two methods are used: saadhaarant: rajat aargentite naamak rajat ayask se nikaala jaataa he
 The 'cyanide method' is used more and more for its production
 is vidhi main rajat ayask ke aarambhik dalan ke pashchaat cynide vilyan main uskaa jal ke saath peshan kiya jaataa he
 In this way, the pulp which is received is sent in huge tanks
 yahan par or cynide milakar vilyan kaa sandran, 0
25 prati shat sodium cynide tak, kiya jaataa he or lagbhag teen din tak sampeedit vaayu dwaara uskaa manthan kiya jaataa he
 After filtering the solution, a vacuum is generated to remove the dissolved air from it and then pass it through an emulsion of 'zinc powder' and precipitate the silver
 is kriya main avakshipt rajat ke bhaar kaa 60 pratishat jasta vyay hota he
 The precipitated solution is pumped into the purifiers from where the precipitates are separated and dried
 isamen 75 se 90 prati shat tak rajat tathaa kuch apdravya or atirikt jasta hota he
 It is melted directly into the reflective wall, or an initial acid reaction is performed to expel the zinc
 sis, jasta, tamra athwa nickel dhaatuon ke ayask newnaadhik maatra main rajat dhaatu se adhiktar mishrit hote hai, jo in dhaatuon ke parishkaran ke samay up-utpaada ke rup main praapt hota he
 Only 45 percent silver is obtained from the refining of sis-zinc-ore
 sis-ayask se tamra, arsenic, antimony ityadi ko dur karne ke baad mridu sis ko jasta dwaara virajteekaran karne ke liye 200 ton dharitavaali kettleyon main pump kiya jaataa he
 Remove the layer of zinc zinc that is heated in the retort
 is prakaar jaste kaa aswan ho jaataa he or retort main jo avshesh bachataa he use kharparit karke rajat kii prapti kii jaati he
 Producing metals from ores is not enough
 maanav upyog ke liye unhen sulabh banane main unako aakaar dena aavashyak he
 The methods of shaping metals can be divided mainly into four parts: jo aakaar atyant jatil hote hai unhen is vidhi se banaaya jaataa he
 For this, molds are made with the help of models of wood or metals
 ye saanche bahudhaa silica ke banaae jate hai, parantu dhaatuon ke sthaayee saanche bhi kaam main aate hai
 When the mold is ready, the metal is put in a liquefied state and when it freezes, take it out and mechanize it
 jo aakaar samametiya hote hai unako aakaar dene kaa kaary is vidhi se kiya jaataa he
 It involves inserting a metalloscope from between two rotating cylinders, which causes the ingot to roll
 lunthan ushn athwa shitavastha main kiya ja saktaa he
 In hot plumes, the metalloids are heated to a certain temperature, while in cold plumes no heating is required
 is vidhi main tapt dhatupindakon kaa vishaal hathode se kuttan kiya jaataa he
 Rail axes are made by this method
 bahudhaa chote chote aakaar banane ke liye thappon kaa upyog hota he
 The tools are hurt by placing hot metal ingots between two steel slabs, causing them to become shaped into slabs
 is vidhi main tapt dhaatu ko ucch daab kii sahaayta se thappon ke bich se nikaala jaataa he
 By this action many complex shapes, which cannot be created by the method of deformation, are created
 chade, naaliyaan tathaa anya aakaar is vidhi se saraltapurvak banate hai
 Metallurgical brethren are so different in terms of usage and shape that their classification is extremely difficult
 mukhyat: inhen prayukt idhan tathaa kaary pranali ke aadhaar par vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 Different types of fuels can be used in these nations
 yahan par dhaatukarmee udyogon main adhikadhik kaam aanevaale kuch bhrashtron kaa sthool varnan kiya jaataa he
 It is of many types
 aloh-dhaatu-udyog main coke athwa tel se garam honevaali bhatthiyaan adhik prachlit hai
 They have a lining of heat bricks inside
 tel se jalanevaali bhatthiyon main jwalak lage hote hai
 Metal is liquefied in clocks
 avanaman bhatthiyon main ghadiyon ko baahar nikaalane kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati, varan inhen avanamit karke dhaatu ko darvi main nikaal lete hai
 It can also be called a cladding furnace
 ye achal hoti hai or adhikansh agnisah iton se banaai jaati hai
 In these kilns, coal or coke is burnt on the grating and placed in metal clocks and placed on the burning coals
 idhan jalane se jo dahan-gas nikalati he vah chimney ke dwaara baahar nikal jaati he
 In this type of furnace, combustion products are not allowed to come into contact with the charge
 iske liye ek chhaadan laga diya jaataa he, jiske andar prabhaar rahata he or dahan-utpaada uske chaaron ore baahar se ooshmaa pradaan karte hai
 Such frescoes can be heated by solid, liquid, gaseous or electric fuels
 inkaa upyog adhikansh ooshmopchaar main hota he
 This furnace is made of fire bricks
 isamen ek dahanakaksh hota he jahaan idhan jalataa he or uski jwaala pradravana athwa taapan kaksh ko le jaai jaati he, jahaan prabhaar ko pradravit athwa tapt kiya jaataa he
 Solid, liquid or gaseous fuels are used in these furnaces
 inaki chhaten jhukaawadaar hoti hai, jiske kaaran jwaala prabhaar kii ore paravartit hoti he
 While describing the iron production process, a detailed description of the ventilator has been given
 vaatyabhatthee kaa mukhya upyog loh utpaadan main hi hota he
 But it is also used in the production of some non-ferrous metals
 aloh dhaatu-utpaadan main jo bhatthiyaan upyog main aati he, ve adhiktar ytaakar tath lohbhatthee se bahut choti hoti hai
 The heat in those furnaces is also much less than that of the iron furnace
 isliye bahut achche agnisah padaarthon kii bhi aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 The principle of remaining work and composition is similar to that of Lohbhatti
 is prakaar kii bhatthi ispaat banane ke liye adhik upyukt siddh hui he
 It has an open latch in which charge is discharged
 yahan prabhaar or idhan kii jwalaaye ek duusare ke sampark main aati hai or is prakaar jwaala apni ushma prabhaar ko pradaan karti he
 Fuel oil, alkatara or producer gas is used in this furnace
 jin bhatthiyon main punarjanan pranali prayukt hoti he unhen punaryoji bhatthi kehete hai
 In these, the combustion product and the heated gas pass through the regenerator and thus give its heat to the insulating bricks placed in the regenerator
 kuch samay pashchaat is ooshmaa kaa upyog us gas athwa vaayu ko garam karne main kiya jaataa he jo prabhaar ke liye bhatthi main bheji jaati he
 In this way fuel is saved and high temperature is attained
 jin bhatthiyon main vidyut shakti kaa upyog idhan ke rup main kiya jaataa he unhen vidyut bhatthi kehete hai
 They are of many types and they are named according to their usefulness
 in bhatthiyon main taap kaa niyantran bahut acchhee tarah hota he, parantu ye kaaphi vyaysadhy hoti hai

 lahore prastaavna,, san 1940 main akhil bhartiya muslim lig dwaara prastaavit ek aadhikarik rajnatik sankalpana thi jise muslim lig ke 22 se 24 march 1940 main chale teen divasiy lahore satr ke dauraan paarit kiya gaya tha
 The proposal called for "independent princely states" for Muslims, allegedly in the northwestern eastern regions of British India, and to make the provinces included in the said units autonomous and sovereign
 tatpashchaat, yah sankalpana "bharat ke musalamaanon" ke liye pakistan naamak main ek alag swatantra swytt mulk banane kii maang karne main parivartit ho gaya
 Although the name Pakistan had already been proposed by Chaudhary Chaudhary Rahmat Ali, by 1933, Majloom Haq Mohammad Ali Jinnah and other Muslim leaders were firm on the principle of Hindu Muslim unity, but the partition encouragement misconceptions that were consistently promoted by the British
 Hindus had aroused a sense of mistrust and hatred towards Muslims
 a sensitive political environment had also promoted the proposal of Pakistan is prastaav kii peshi ke upalaksh main prativarsh 23 march ko pakistan main yom-e-pakistan ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The historic resolution was passed at the end of the three-day annual meeting of the All India Muslim League at Minto Park, Lahore on 23 March, on the basis of which the Muslim League started the movement for the acquisition of a separate country of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent and After seven years, it was successful in getting its demand passed
 upmahadweep main british raaj dwaara satta janata ko saunpane kii prakriya ke pehle charan main 1936 / 1937 main pehle aam chunaav hue the unamem muslim lig ko buree tarah se haar uthaani padi thi or uske is daawey ko gambhir nicha pahunchi thi ki vah upmahadweep ke musalamaanon ke ekmaatr pratinidhi sabha he
 Therefore, the morale of the Muslim League leadership and workers was shattered and there was a strange sense of helplessness on them
 congress ko madras, you pi, si pi, bihar or urisa main spasht bahumat hasil hui thi, seemaa or bombay main usne duusare dalon ke saath milakar gathbandhan sarkaar kaa gathan kiya tha or sindh or assam main jahaan muslim haaavee the congress ko kaaphi safalataa mili thi
 In Punjab, however, the head of Inam Hussain's uninusset Party and in Bengal Maulvi Kripa Haq's Praja Krishak Party won
 garaz bharat ke 11 praanton main se kisi ek rajya main bhi muslim lig ko satta praapt na ho sakaa
 In these circumstances, the Muslim League, it seemed, is diverging from the political stream of the subcontinent
 is dauraan congress ne jo pehali baar satta ke nashe main kuch zyada hi sir shaar thi, aise upaay kiye jinase musalamaanon ke dilon main bhay or khataron ne janm lenaa shuru kar diya
 As the Congress declared Hindi as the national language, the Gao decay was banned and the Congress tricolor was given the status of the national flag
 is maamle main muslim lig kii satta khone ke saath apane netritv main yah bhaavana paidaa ho rahaa tha ki muslim lig satta se is aadhaar par vanchit kar di gai he ki vah apane aap ko musalamaanon kii pratinidhi sabha kehalaati he
 This was the starting point for the awareness of the spirit of two separate nations led by the Muslim League
 isi dauraan dwitiya vishwa yuddh samarthan ke badale satta kii bharpoor hastantaran ke masale par british raaj or congress ke bich charchaa bhadkaa or congress satta se alag ho gai to muslim lig ke liye kuch daravaaje khulte dikhaai die
 And in this background, this 3-day meeting of All India Muslim League in Lahore started on 22 March
 baithak se 4 din pehle lahore main allamaa purvi ke deen party ne pabandi todate hue ek sainya parade kii thi jise rokane ke liye police ne golibari kii
 Around 35 Deen were killed
 is ghatana kii vajah se lahore main jabardast tanaav tha or punjab main muslim lig kii sahyogi party uninst party satta thi or is baat kaa khatra tha ki deen ke fawda vaahak kaaryakarta, muslim lig kaa yah baithak na hone den yaa is avasar par hangaamaa barapa he
 Incidentally, in view of the seriousness, Muhammad Ali Jinnah addressed the inaugural session in which he said for the first time that the problem in India is not communal, but Ben International means it is a problem of two countries
 unhone kaha ki hinduon or musalamaanon main antar itnaa bada or spasht he ki ek kendriya sarkaar ke tahat unka gathbandhan khataron se bharpoor hoga
 He said that there is only one way in this matter that i have different afflictions
 duusare din inhen padon par 23 march ko is samay ke bengal ke mukhyamantri maulavee krupa haq ne sankalp lahore diya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki is tab tak koi sanvaidhanik yojana na to vyavhaarya hoga or na musalamaanon ko hoga jab tak ek duusare se mili hue bhugolic ikaayiyon alag gaanaa kshetron main parisemen na ho
 The resolution said that in these areas where Muslims have a numerical majority, such as the Northwest and Northeast regions of India, they should be set free to combine them with the units having high autonomy and sovereignty
 maulavee inaam ul dwaara kii peshkash kii is sankalp kaa samarthan upi ke muslim legi netaa choudhary riek lsamaan, punjab moulana jafar ali khan, seemaa se sardaar aurangzeb sindh se sir abdulla haaron or baluchistan se kaaji isa ne kii
 The resolution was passed in the closing session on 23 March
 april san 1941 main madras main muslim lig ke sammelan main sankalp lahore ko party ke samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya or isi ke aadhaar par pakistan andolan shuru hui
 But even then these areas were not clearly identified, including the demand for separate Muslim states
 pehali baar pakistan kii maang ke liye kshetron kii pahchaan 7 april san 1946 dilli ke teen divasiy sammelan main kii gai jisamen kendriya or prantiy vidhansabhaon ke muslim legi sadasyon ne bhaag liya tha
 At this conference, a resolution was passed to present the demand of the Muslim League to the delegation of the Cabinet Mission coming from Britain, which was drafted by two members of the Executive of the Muslim League, Chaudhary Riksalam and Hassan Isfahani
 is karaadaad main spasht rup se pakistan main shaamil kiye jane vaale kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai thi
 Bengal and Assam in the northeast and Punjab, Seema, Sindh and Balochistan in the northwest
 aashcharya kii baat he ki is sankalp main kashmir kaa koi zikr nahin tha haalanki uttar pashchim main muslim bahul kshetra tha or punjab se judaa hua tha
 It is very important that the two states were completely omitted from the Delhi Convention in this resolution, which was very clear in the resolution Lahore, instead it was demanded as the only state of Pakistan
 shaayad bahut kam logon ko yah pataa he ki sankalp lahore kaa mul masauda us jamaane ke punjab ke uninst mukhyamantri sar sikandar hayaat khan ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The Uniunsat party was integrated into the Muslim League at that time and the head Sikandar Hayat Khan was the President of the Punjab Muslim League
 sir sikandar hayaat khan ne sankalp ke mul masaude main upmahadweep main ek kendriya sarkaar ke aadhaar par lagbhag condereshan prastaavit thi lekin jab masauda muslim lig subject cameti main vichaar kiya gaya to kaayade ajam mohammad ali jinna ne khud is masaude main ekmaatr centre sarkaar kaa ullekh moulik kaat diya
 The head Sikandar Hayat Khan was strongly angry on this and stated clearly in the Punjab Legislative Assembly on 11 March 1941 that his vision of Pakistan was mainly different from the principles of Jinnah Saheb
 unka kahana tha ki vah bharat main ek ore hindu raaj or duusari ore muslim raaj ke aadhaar par vitaran ke sakht khilaaf hai or vah aisi bakaul unke vinaashkari vitaran kaa datakar muqabla karenge
 But this did not happen
 sir sikandar hayaat khan duusare varsh san 1942 main 50 saal kii umr main nidhan ho gaya yun punjab main mohammad ali jinna teevr virodh ke uthte hue hisar se mukti mil gai
 In the Delhi session of 1946, the resolution of Pakistan was presented by Sankalp Hussain Shaheed Sohrawardy and it was praised by the Muslim Legion leader of UP, Chaudhary Riyakalsam
 sankalp lahore pesh karne vaale maulavee krupa haq is sammelan main shariq nahin hue kyonki unhen sun 1941 main muslim lig sekharaj kar diya gaya tha
 At the Delhi conference, Abu Alhashm, the leader of Bengal, strongly opposed this resolution and argued that this resolution is quite different from the Lahore resolution which is part of the constitution of the Muslim League - he said that the resolution was clearly in Lahore in two states There was no option to amend this basic resolution of the Muslim League to the Delhi Convention
 abavaalhashm ke anusaar kaayade ajam ne isi sammelan main or baad main bombay main ek baithak main yah samajhaayaa tha ki is samay ke baad upmahadweep main do alag samvidhan vidhansabhaon ke gathan kii baat ho rahi he to dilli kanvension sankalp main ek rajya kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 But when the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan sets the constitution, it will be the final arbiter of this problem and it will have full authority to decide the formation of two separate states
 lekin pakistan kii samvidhan sabha ne na to kaayade ajam jivan main or na jab san 1956 main desh kaa pehla samvidhan paarit ho rahaa tha upmahadweep main musalamaanon kii do swatantra or swytt rajyon ke sthapana par vichaar kiya
 After 25 years of political upheaval and conflict and the destruction of the Bangladesh war in Sun 1971, but two different afflictions of Muslims emerged in the subcontinent, whose resolution is still safe in the case of Lahore

 Cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator
 1932 i
 main professor i
 o
 larens ne warkale institute, california, main sarvapratham cychlotron kaa avishkaar kiya
 At present, it is the most powerful tool for instantaneous technique
 cychlotron ke avishkaar ke liye professor larens ko 1939 i
 main "nobel puraskaar" pradaan kiya gaya
 Prior to the inventor of the cyclotron, the accelerator of charged particles used equipment such as Cockcroft Walton's potential multiplier, Van de Graf stationary power generator, tracer accelerator, etc
 parantu in sabhi upkarnon ke upyog main kuch na kuch praayogic kathinaaiyaan vidyaman thim
 For example, the use of a tracer accelerator had the following two inconveniences; cychlotron kii upyogitaayen itani adhik he ki un sabko yahan uddhrut karnaa sambhav nahin
 Nevertheless the main utilities are being provided here
 ucch urja ke dutron, protron, elfaa kan evam neutron kii prapti ke liye yah ek prabal saadhan he
 These high-energy particles are used for nuclear transposition
 udhaaharan swaroop cychlotron se praapt ucch urja ke dutron berilium torget kii ore phenke jate hai jisase boron nabhikon evam neutronon kaa nirmaan hota he or saath hi urja bhi praapt hoti he
 Can display the entire process as follows: nabhikeey tatwantaran ke adhyayan ke shaikshik mahatv ke atirikt yah radio sodium, radio phosphorus, radio aayran evam anya radioactive tatwon ke vyapaarik nirmaan ke liye upyog main laayaa gaya he
 The attainment of radioactive elements has acquired an important place in research
 har radioactive tatv chikitsa, vigyaan, ejiniyari, technology aadi ke kshetron main nae-nae anusandhanon ko janm de rahaa he
 These research are certainly part of the "peaceful use of nuclear energy"
 cychlotron ucch aavriti ke prayavarti vibhavantar kaa prayog karke aaweshit kan punj ko twarit karata he
 These charged particles are applied inside a vacuum chamber between two hollow "D" shaped sheet metal electrodes called "dies"
 unke bich ek sankeern antaraal ke saath ek dusre ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he, jo kanon ko sthanantarit karne ke liye unke bheetar ek belanaakaar jagah banaate hai
 The particles are left in the center of this space
 yah des ek bade vidyut chumbak ke chhadon ke bich sthit hote hai jo electrode ke samadharaatal ke liye sthitik chumbakeey kshetra bi loop ko lagu karata he
 The magnetic field tilts the path of the particle, because the causal lawrange force is perpendicular to the direction of motion
 'kumaun' anchal ke sabhi taalon main 'saattal' kaa jo anokhaa or naiysargik soundarya he, vah kisi duusare taal kaa nahin he
 The main route to reach this pool is from Bhimtal

 Where this pool is famous for its natural beauty, it is also famous for the art of humans
 yahi kaaran he ki kumaun kshetra ke sabhi taalon main yah taal sarvottam he
 Boating is provided with special facilities in this pool

 Various types of pools, vines have been installed around the entire pool
 baithne ke alaava sidhiyon or sinder - sundar pulon kaa nirmaan kar 'saattal' ko swarg jaisaa taal banaaya gaya he
 Indeed, this rhythm is paramount in terms of beauty

 Value chain or value chain analysis is a concept from business management first described and practiced by Michael Porter in 1985 in his best-selling, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance
 ek mulya shrunkhlaa ek vishisht udyog main kaary kar rahi ek form ke liye gatividhiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa he
 The business unit is the appropriate level for building the value chain, not the divisional level or the organized level
 utpaada, kram main shrunkhlaa kii sabhi gatividhiyon se guzarate hai or prayek gatividhi par utpaada kuch mulya praapt karte hai
 The range of activities gives products more added value than the addition of the added value of all activities
 yah mahatvapurn he ki mulya shrunkhlaa kii avadharana ke saath gatividhiyon ke dauraan hone vaali laagat kaa mishran na kiya jaae
 antar ke liye ek heere kaatane vaale kaa udhaaharan istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The cost of cutting activity may be low, but this activity adds a lot of value to the final product, as a rough diamond is significantly less valuable than a shaped diamond
 aamtaur par, varnit mulya shrunkhlaa or prakriyaaon kaa pralekhan, prakriya nity-karm ke avlamban kaa moolyankan or pareekshan vyapaar ke gunvattta pramann kaa crod hai, jaise iesao 9001
 The value chain classifies the common value-adding activities of an organization
 "praathmik gatividhiyon" main shaamil hai: antargami prachaalan-tantra, parichaalan, bahari prachaalan-tantra, vipanan or bikri or seva 
 "samarthan gatividhiyon" main shaamil hai: prashasnic avasanrachana prabandhan, maanav sansaadhan prabandhan, praudyogiki or ]
 prayek mulya gatividhi ke liye laagat or mulya chaalkon kii pahchaan kii jaati he
 The value chain structure quickly paved the way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analytics tool for]
 mulya dhara kii saral avadharana, ek paar-kaaryaatmak prakriya jo agle dashak main viksit kii gai, use 1990 ke dashak ke shuru main kuch safalataa mili
 The concept of the value chain has been extended beyond individual firms
 yah puri aapurti shrunkhlaa or vitaran network par lagu ho sakati he
 Delivery of a mix of products and services to the end customer will create various economic factors, each managing its own value chain
 un mulya shrunkhalaaon kii udyog vyapak sankalith anyonyakriya ek vistrut mulya shrunkhlaa banaati he, jo kabhi kabhi vistaar main vishviya hoti he
 Potters refer to this large interconnected system of the value chain as the "value system"
 ek mulya pranali main ek form ke aapurtikar kii mulya shrunkhlaa, swayan form, form ke vitaran channel or form ke kharidaar shaamil hote hai
 Capturing the value generated along the chain is a new approximation taken by many management strategists

 Value chain analysis has also been used successfully in large petrochemical plant maintenance organizations to show how job selection, task planning, task scheduling and finally performance management help to operate less often

 Value chain analysis has also been used as a strategy to reduce poverty in the development sector by improving the value chain

 Prabhavati Devi's father's name was Ganganarayan Dutt

 Of all his brothers, Subhash was most fond of Sharad Chandra

 After completing primary education from Protestant European School in Cuttack, in 1909, he joined Revensha Collegiate School
 college ke principal benimadhav das ke vyaktitv kaa subhash ke man par acha prabhaav padaa
 At the age of just fifteen, Subhash had done a full study of Vivekananda literature
 1915 main unhone intermediat kii pariksha biimaar hone ke baavjood dwitiya shrenee main uteern kii
 In 1916, when he was a BA student in Philosophy, there was a fight between the teachers and the students of the Presidency College on something that led to the leadership of the students, due to which he was expelled from the Presidency College for a year and also banned the examination

 49veen bengal regiment main bhartee ke liye unhone pariksha di kintu ankhen kharaab hone ke kaaran unhen sena ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Somehow he got admission in the Scottish Church College, but the mind was asking to join the army
 khaali samay kaa upyog karne ke liye unhone terrytorial army kii pariksha di or fort wiliam senalay main rangarut ke rup main pravesh paa gayi
 Then it was thought that somewhere like BA Intermediate, Subhash studied very diligently and passed the BA examination in the first class in 1919
 kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main unka doosraa sthaan tha
 The father wished that Subhash should become ICS, but given his age, he had to pass this exam only once
 unhone pita se choubees ghante kaa samay yah sochane ke liye maanga taaki ve pariksha dene yaa na dene par koi antim nirnay le saken
 He kept awake all night wondering what to do
 aakhir unhone pariksha dene kaa faisla kiya or 15 sitambar 1919 ko england chale gayi
 Unable to get admission in any London school for exam preparation, Subhash somehow got admission for studying Tripas examination of mental and moral sciences in Kits William Hall
 isse unke rahane va khaane kii samasya hal ho gayi
 Recently, taking admission was an excuse to show the real purpose by passing in ICS
 so unhone 1920 main variyata suchi main chauthaa sthaan praapt karte hue paas kar lee
 After this, Subhash wrote a letter to his elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose and wanted to know his opinion that the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvind Ghosh have been captured on their hearts and minds, how can they become slaves of the British by becoming ICS? Wrote a letter of resignation from the ICS to the Secretary of India ES Montague on 22 April 1921
 ek patr deshvandhu chittaranjan das ko likhaa
 But soon after getting the letter from her mother Prabhavati that "father, family members or anything else, they are proud of their son's decision
" " subhash june 1921 main maansik evam naitik vigyaan main trypass kii degree ke saath swadesh waapas laut aaye
 Inspired by the work of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, a freedom fighter from Kolkata, he wanted to work with Subhash Dasbabu
 england se unhone dasababu ko khat likhakar unke saath kaam karne kii ichha prakat kii
 According to the advice of Rabindranath Thakur, on his return to India, he first went to Mumbai and met Mahatma Gandhi
 mumbai main gandhi ji manibhawan main nivas karte the
 Gandhiji and Subhash met for the first time on 20 July 1921
 gandhi ji ne unhen kolkata jaakar dasababu ke saath kaam karne kii salaah di
 Subhash then came to Kolkata and met Dasbabu
 un dinon gandhi ji ne angrez sarkaar ke khilaaf asahyog andolan chalaa rakhaa tha
 Dasbabu was leading this movement in Bengal
 unke saath subhash is aandolan main sahabhaagi ho gayi
 In 1922, Dasbabu founded the Swaraj Party under the Congress
 vidhansabha ke andar se angrez sarkaar kaa virodh karne ke liye kolkata mahapalika kaa chunaav swaraj party ne ladakar jeeta or dasababu kolkata ke mahayor ban gayi
 He made Subhash the chief executive officer of the municipality
 subhash ne apane kaarykaal main kolkata mahapalika kaa puraa dhaanchaa or kaam karne kaa tarika hi badal daalaa
 All the routes in Kolkata were changed to English names and given Indian names
 swatantrata sangram main praan nyochhavar karne waalon ke parivarajanon ko mahapalika main naukari milane lagi
 Very soon Subhash became an important youth leader of the country
 jawaharlal nehru ke saath subhash ne congress ke antargat yuvakon kii independence lig shuru kii
 When the Simon Commission came to India in 1928, the Congress showed it black flags
 kolkata main subhash ne is aandolan kaa netritv kiya
 To answer the Simon Commission, the Congress entrusted the task of framing the future Constitution of India to the eight-member Commission
 motilal nehru is ayog ke adhyaksh or subhash uske ek sadsy the
 This commission presented the Nehru Report
 1928 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main kolkata main hua
 In this session, Subhash wearing a khaki uniform saluted Motilal Nehru in a military manner
 gandhi ji un dinon purna swarajya kii maang se sahamat nahin the
 In this session, he was determined to demand Dominion status from the British government
 lekin subhashbabu or jawaharlal nehru ko purna swaraj kii maang se peeche hatana manjuur nahin tha
 In the end, it was decided that the British government should be given one year to give Dominion status
 agar ek saal main angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii to congress purna swaraj kii maang karegi
 But the British government did not meet this demand
 isaliye 1930 main jab congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main lahore main hua tab aisa tay kiya gaya ki 26 janvari kaa din swatantrata diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa
 On 26 January 1931, Subhash was leading a huge front by hoisting the national flag in Kolkata when the police fired sticks on him and wounded him and sent him to jail
 jab subhash jail main the tab gandhi ji ne angrej sarkaar se samjhauta kiya or sab kaidiyon ko reeha karvaa diya
 But the British government refused to release revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh
 bhagat singh kii phaansi maaf karaane ke liye gandhi ji ne sarkaar se baat to kii parantu narmi ke saath
 Subhash wanted Gandhiji to break the agreement made with the British government on this subject
 lekin gandhiji apni ore se diya gaya vachan todane ko raji nahin the
 The British government stood firm in its place and Bhagat Singh and his associates were hanged
 bhagat singh ko na bachaa paane par subhash gandhi or congress ke tarikon se bahut naaraaz ho gayi
 Subhash was imprisoned a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 main chah maheene kaa karawas hua
 In 1925, a revolutionary named Gopinath Saha wanted to kill Kolkata Superintendent of Police Charles Tegart
 usne galati se arnest de naamak ek vyapaaree ko maar daalaa
 For this he was hanged
 gopinath ko phaansi hone ke baad subhash foot foot kar roye
 He sought the dead body of Gopinath and performed his last rites
 isse angrez sarkaar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki subhash jvalant krantikariyon se na keval sambandh hi rakhte hai apitu ve unhen utprerit bhi karte hai
 On the same pretext, the British government arrested Subhash and sent him imprisoned in Mandal prison in Myanmar indefinitely without any trial
 5 navambar 1925 ko deshbandhu chittaranjan das kolkata main chal based
 Subhash heard the news of his death on the radio at Mandalay jail
 mandle karagrih main rahete samay subhash kii tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gayi
 He developed tuberculosis
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne phir bhi unhen reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 To release them, the government placed a condition that they go to Europe for treatment
 lekin sarkaar ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki ilaaj ke baad ve bharat kab laut sakate hai
 Hence Subhash did not accept this condition
 aakhir main paristhiti itani kathin ho gayi ki jail adhikariyon ko yah lagane laga ki shaayad ve karawas main hi na mar jaayen
 The British government did not even want to take the risk that Subhash died in prison
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 Subhash then went to Dalhousie for treatment
 1930 main subhash karawas main hi the ki chunaav main unhen kolkata kaa mahayor chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the government was forced to release him
 1932 main subhash ko phir se karawas hua
 This time he was kept in Almora jail
 almoda jail main unki tabiyat phir se kharaab ho gayi
 On the advice of doctors, Subhash agreed to go to Europe this time for treatment
 san 1933 se lekar 1936 tak subhash europe main rahe
 Subhash continued his work in Europe, taking care of his health
 vahaan ve italy ke netaa musolini se mili, jinhone unhen bharat ke swatantrata sangram main sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 De Valera, the leader of Ireland, became a good friend of Subhash
 jin dinon subhash europe main the unheen dinon jawaharlal nehru kii patni kamala nehru kaa austria main nidhan ho gaya
 Subhash went there and consoled Jawaharlal Nehru
 baad main subhash europe main vitthal bhai patel se mili
 Subhash along with Vitthalbhai Patel held the mantra which came to be known as patel-bose analysis
 is vishleshan main un donon ne gandhi ke netritv kii jamkar ninda kii
 Subsequently, when Vitthal Bhai Patel became ill, Subhash served him a lot
 magar vitthal bhai patel nahin bache, unka nidhan ho gaya
 In his will, Vitthal Bhai Patel gave all his property to Subhash
 magar unke nidhan ke pashchaat unke bhai sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne is vasiyat ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Sardar Patel prosecuted this will in court
 yah mukadmaa jeetne par sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne apane bhai kii sari sampatti gandhi ke harijan seva kaary ko bhent kar di
 In 1934, Subhash received the news of his father's death
 khabar sunate hi ve hawaii jahaaj se karachi hote hue kolkata laute
 Even though he had come to know in Karachi that his father had died, he still went to Kolkata
 kolkata pahonchte hi angrej sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or kai din jail main rakhkar waapas europe bhej diya
 In 1934, when Subhash was staying in Austria for his treatment, he needed an English-knowing typist to write his book
 unke ek mitra ne emily shenkal naam kii ek austrian mahila se unki mulaakaat kara di
 Emily's father was a famous vet
 subhash emily kii ore aakarshith hue or un donon main swaabhaavik prem ho gaya
 In view of the strict laws of Nazi Germany, both of them got married in 1942 by Hindu method at a place called Bad Gastein
 viena main emily ne ek putree ko janm diya
 Subhash first saw her when she was barely four weeks old
 unhone uskaa naam anita bose rakhaa tha
 When Subhash died in an alleged plane crash in Taiwan in August 1945, Anita Paune was three years old
 anita abhi jivit he
 Her name is Anita Bose Faf
 apane pita ke parivaar janon se milane anita phalf kabhi-kabhi bharat bhi aati he
 In 1938, the annual session of the Congress was scheduled to be held in Haripura
 is adhiveshan se pehle gandhi ji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa
 This was the 51st session of the Congress
 isliye congress adhyaksh subhash chandra bose kaa swaagat 51 belon dwaara khinche hue rath main kiya gaya
 Subhash's presidential speech was very effective in this session
 kisi bhi bhartiya raajnneetik vyakti ne shaayad hi itnaa prabhavi bhaashan kabhi diya ho
 During his presidential tenure, Subhash established the Planning Commission
 jawaharlal nehru iske pehle adhyaksh banaaye gayi
 Subhash also established a Science Council in Bangalore under the chairmanship of the famous scientist Sir Visvesvaraya
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya
 The Congress, headed by Subhash, decided to send a medical team under the leadership of Dr
 Dwarkanath Kotnis to assist the Chinese people
 aage chalakar jab subhash ne bharat ke swatantrata sangram main japan se sahyog kiya tab kai log unhe japan kii kathputli or phacist kehane lage
 But this incident proves that Subhash was neither a puppet of Japan nor did he agree with the fascist ideology
 1938 main gandhiji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa to tha magar unhen subhash kii kaarypaddati pasand nahin aayi
 Meanwhile, the Second World War was clouded in Europe
 subhash chaahate the ki england kii is kathinaayee kaa laabh uthaakar bharat kaa swatantrata sangram adhik teevr kiya jaye
 He had also started taking steps in this direction during his presidential tenure but Gandhiji did not agree with this
 1939 main jab nayaa congress adhyaksh chunane kaa vakt aayaa tab subhash chaahate the ki koi aisa vyakti adhyaksh banaaya jaye jo is maamle main kisi dabaav ke aage bilkul na jhuke
 since no one is volunteering so, subhash decided to be Congrees President
 lekin gandhi unhen adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 Gandhi chose Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the post of president
 kaviver rabindranath thakur ne gandhi ko khat likhakar subhash ko hi adhyaksh banane kii vinati kii
 Scientists like Prafulla Chandra Rai and Meghnad Saha also wanted to see Subhash as the president again
 lekin gandhiji ne is maamle main kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Years later, on finding a deal in Congress was elected to the presidency
 sab samajhate the ki jab mahatma gandhi ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kaa saath diya hai tab ve chunaav aasaani se jeet jaayenge
 But in reality, Subhash got 1580 votes and Sitaramayya got 1377 votes in the election
 gandhiji ke virodh ke baavjood subhashbabu 203 maton se chunaav jeet gayi
 But with the result of the election, the matter did not end
 gandhiji ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kii haar ko apni haar bataakar apane saathiyon se kah diya ki agar wein subhash ke tareekon se sahamat nahin hai to wein congress se hat sakaten hai
 After this, 12 of the 14 members of the Congress executive resigned
 jawaharlal nehru tatasth bane rahe or akele sharadbabu subhash ke saath rahe
 The annual Congress session of 1939 took place in Tripuri
 is adhiveshan ke samay subhashbabu tej bukhaar se itane biimaar ho gayi the ki unhen strechar par litaakar adhiveshan main laana padaa
 Gandhiji himself was not present in this session and his colleagues also did not give any support to Subhash
 adhiveshan ke baad subhash ne samjhaute ke liye bahut koshish kii lekin gandhiji or unke saathiyon ne unki ek na maani
 The situation became such that Subhash could not do anything
 aakhir main tang aakar 29 april 1939 ko subhash ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 On 3 May 1939, Subhash founded his own party within the Congress in the name of Forward Bloc
 kuch din baad subhash ko congress se hi nikaal diya gaya
 Later, the Forward Bloc became an independent party on its own
 dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru hone se pehle se hi forward block ne swatantrata sangram ko or adhik teevr karne ke liye jan jagriti shuru kii
 On 3 September 1939, Subhash was reported to be fighting a war in Britain and Germany in Madras
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab bharat ke paas sunaharaa mauka he use apni mukti ke liye abhiyaan tej kar dena chahiye
 On 8 September 1939, Subhash was called to the Congress Working Committee as a special invitee to decide the party's stance towards the war
 unhone apni raay ke saath yah sankalp bhi doharaaya ki agar congress yah kaam nahin kar sakati he to forward block apane dam par british raaj ke khilaaf yuddh shuru kar degaa
 The following year in July, the Halwet Pillar at Calcutta, which was a symbol of India's slavery, was submerged overnight by Subhash's youth brigade
 subhash ke swayamsevak uski neenv kii ek-ek eent ukhaad le gayi
 This was a symbolic beginning
 iske madhyam se subhash ne yah sandesh diya tha ki jaise unhone yah stambh dhul main mila diya he usee tarah ve british samrajya kii bhi eent se eent baja denge
 As a result, the British government imprisoned all the main leaders of the forward block, including Subhash
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan subhash jail main niskriy rahanaa nahin chaahate the
 Subhash started a fast in jail to force the government to release him
 haalat kharaab hote hi sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 But the British government also did not want Subhash to be free during the war
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen unke hi ghar par najarband karke baahar police kaa kadaa paharaa bitha diya
 Subhash made a plan to get out of detention
 16 janvari 1941 ko ve police ko chakma dete hue ek pathan mohammad jiauddin ke vesh main apane ghar se nikle
 Sharadbabu's elder son Shishir took him away from Kolkata to Gomoh in his car
 gomoh railway stesan se frontier mail pakadakar ve peshawar pahunche
 In Peshawar he found Mian Akbar Shah, a co-operative of the Forward Bloc
 miyaan akbar shah ne unki mulaakaat, keerti kisaan party ke bhagatraam talwaar se kara di
 With Bhagatram Talwar, Subhash set out from Peshawar towards Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
 is safar main bhagatraam talwaar rahamat khan naam ke pathan or subhash unke guunge-bahere chachaa bane the
 He completed this journey by walking in the hills
 kabul main subhash do maheenon tak uttamchand malhotra naamak ek bhartiya vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 There he first wanted to enter the Russian Embassy
 isamen naakaamayaab rahane par unhone german or italian duutavaason main pravesh paane kii koshish kii
 His attempt at the Italian Embassy was a success
 german or italian duutavaason ne unki sahaayta kii
 Finally, after becoming an Italian man named Arlando Mazzonta, Subhash left Kabul and reached Berlin, the capital of Germany via Moscow, the capital of Russia
 berlin main subhash sarvapratham riben trope jaise germany ke anya netaaon se mili
 He founded the Indian Freedom Organization and Azad Hind Radio in Germany
 isi dauraan subhash netaji ke naam se jane jane lage
 Adam Fon Trott, a minister in the German government, became a good friend of Subhash
 aakhir 29 may 1942 ke din, subhash germany ke sarvocch netaa adolf hitler se mili
 But Hitler was not particularly interested in India
 unhone subhash ko sahaayta kaa koi spasht vachan nahin diya
 Many years ago Hitler wrote the autobiography named Mayan Kampf
 is kitaab main unhone bharat or bhartiya logon kii buraai kii thi
 Subhash expressed his displeasure with Hitler on this subject
 hitler ne apane kiye par maafee maangi or min kamff ke agle sanskaran main vah pariched nikaalane kaa vachan diya
 At last, Subhash came to know that he will not get anything from Hitler and Germany
 isaliye 8 march 1943 ko germany ke keel bandargah main ve apane saathi aabid hasan safrani ke saath ek german pandubbi main baithkar purvi asia kii ore nikal gayi
 The German submarine took her to the shores of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean
 vahaan ve donon samudr main tairkar japani pandubbi tak pahunche
 At the time of World War II, it was the only interchange of civilians by the submarines of the navies of any two countries
 yah japani pandubbi unhen indonesia ke padang bandargah tak pahunchaakar aayi
 Arriving in East Asia, Subhash first took the leadership of the Indian Council of Independence from veteran revolutionary Rasbihari Bose
 singapore ke edward park main rasbihari ne swechha se swatantrata parishad kaa netritv subhash ko saunpa tha
 Japan's Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, impressed by Netaji's personality, assured him to cooperate
 kai din pashchaat netaji ne japan kii sansad ke saamne bhaashan diya
 On 21 October 1943, Netaji established the arzi-hukumate-azad-hind in Singapore
 ve khud is sarkaar ke raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or yumantri bane
 a total of nine countries recognized this government
 netaji azaad hind fouj ke pradhan senapati bhi ban gayi
 In the Azad Hind Fauj, the Japanese army recruited Indian prisoners of war holding the British
 azaad hind fuj main auraton ke liye jhansi kii rani regiment bhi banaayi gayi
 In East Asia, Netaji gave several speeches and appealed to the permanent Indian people to join the free Indian army and provide financial help
 unhone apane aavahan main yah sandesh bhi diya - "tum mujhe khun do, main tumhen azaadi doongaa
 " dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan azaad hind fouj ne japani sena ke sahyog se bharat par akraman kiya
 To inspire his army, Netaji gave the slogan "delhi Chalo"
 donon phujon ne angrejon se andaman or nicobar dweep jeet liye
 This island remained under the discipline of arji-hukumte-azad-hind
 netaji ne in dwipon ko "shahid dweep" or "swaraj dweep" kaa nayaa naam diya
 The two forces jointly attacked Imphal and Kohima
 lekin baad main angrejon kaa palada baari padaa or donon phujon ko peeche hatana padaa
 When the Azad Hind Fauj was retreating, the Japanese army arranged for Netaji to flee
 parantu netaji ne jhansi kii rani regiment kii ladakiyon ke saath saikadon mile chalate rahanaa pasand kiya
 Thus Netaji presented a model of true leadership
 6 july 1944 ko azaad hind radio par apane bhaashan ke madhyam se gandhiji ko sambodhit karte hue netaji ne japan se sahaayta lene kaa apana kaaran or arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind tathaa azaad hind fouj kii sthapana ke uddeshy ke bare main bataaya
 During this speech, Netaji called Gandhiji the Father of the Nation, only then Gandhiji also called him Netaji
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japan kii haar ke baad, netaji ko nayaa rasta dhoondhna jaruri tha
 He decided to ask Russia for help
 18 agast 1945 ko netaji hawaii jahaaj se manchuriya kii taraf ja rahe the
 He went missing during this journey
 is din ke baad ve kabhi kisi ko dikhaayi nahin diye
 On August 23, 1945, Tokyo Radio reported that Netaji was coming from a large bomber aircraft in Saigon that his plane crashed near Taihoku Airport on August 18
 vimaan main unke saath savaar japani general shodei, pilet tathaa kuch anya log maare gayi
 Netaji was severely burnt
 unhen taihoku sainik aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unhone dam tod diya
 According to Colonel Habiburrahman, his last rites were performed in Taihoku
 sitambar ke madhya main unki asthiyaan sanchit karke japan kii rajdhani tokio ke rankoji mandir main rakh di gayin
 According to a document received from the National Archives of India, Netaji died on August 18, 1945 at 21
00 at the military hospital in Taihoku
 swatantrata ke pashchaat bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye 1956 or 1977 main do baar ayog niyukt kiya
 Both times it was found that Netaji was killed in that plane crash
 lekin jis taiwan kii bhoomi par yah durghatana hone kii khabar thi us taiwan desh kii sarkaar se in donon aayogon ne koi baat hi nahin kii
 In 1999, a third commission was formed under the leadership of Manoj Kumar Mukherjee
 2005 main taiwan sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog ko bataa diya ki 1945 main taiwan kii bhoomi par koi hawaii jahaaj durghatnagrast hua hi nahin tha
 In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India, stating that there was no evidence of Netaji's death in that plane crash
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report ko asweekaar kar diya
 Where Netaji went missing on 18 August 1945 and what happened next has become the biggest unanswered mystery in Indian history
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main aaj bhi netaji ko dekhne or milane kaa daawa karne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 Many claims have been made about Netaji's presence in Faizabad from Gumnami Baba to District Raigad in Chhattisgarh state, but the authenticity of all of them is questionable
 chhattisgarh main to subhash chandra bose ke hone kaa maamla rajya sarkaar tak gaya
 But the state government closed the file of the case, considering it not worthy of intervention
 kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh de diya he
 This petition has been filed by the government organization India Smile
 is yachika main bharat sangh, rashtriya salaahkaar parishad, ro, khufia vibhaag, pradhanmantri ke nijee sachiv, raksha sachiv, grih vibhaag or pashchim bengal sarkaar sahit kai anya logon ko prativaadee banaaya gaya he
 All the references changed after the demolition of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
 aatmasamarpan ke uparant japan chaar-paanch varshon tak america ke paanvon tale karahata rahaa
 This was the reason that the thrilling history of Netaji and Azad Hind Sena kept gathering dust in the archives of Tokyo for years
