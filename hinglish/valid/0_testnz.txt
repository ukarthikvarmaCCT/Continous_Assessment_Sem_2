 As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word "republic" as part of their official name - not all these republics by the meaning of elected governments, nor "republic" in the names of all nations with elected governments

 It is known from literature that there were many republics during the period of Panini and Buddha
 tirhut se lekar kapilwastu tak ganraajyon kaa ek chota sa guchha ganga se tarai tak failaa hua tha
 The Buddha was born in the Shakyaganas
 lichchhaviyon kaa ganraajya inamen sabase shaktishaalee tha, uski rajdhani vaishali thi
 But the largest expansion of republics in India was in the Wahik region

 They are also known as the Negotiable Association of Economics
 ye log shantical main vaarta yaa krishi aadi par nirbhar rahete the kintu yudhkaal main apane samvidhan ke anusaar yoddha banakar sangram karte the
 Their political composition was very firm and relatively developed
 inamen kshudrak or maalav do ganraajyon kaa vishesh ullekh aata he
 He fought fiercely with Yavana Akranta Alexander
 vah malwon ke baan se to ghayal bhi ho gaya tha
 For the combined army of these two, Panini mentions the noun Kodudrakamalvi in the Ganpath
 punjab ke uttarpashchim or uttarpurv main bhi anek chote mote ganraajya the, unka ek shrunkhala trigart ke pahari pradesh main vistaarit hua tha jinhen parvatiy sangh kehete the
 The second series was that of the Mahabhalashali castes who settled in the Girigahvars on both banks of the Indus River, which in ancient times were called the Graminik Sangh
 ve hi vartmaan ke kabyli hai
 Their constitution did not develop as much as other republics
 ve praaia: utsedhajivi yaa luutmaar kar jeevika chalaanevaale the
 Even those who were developed in these were called Pooj and those who were backward were called Braat
 sangh yaa ganon kaa ek teesraa guchha saurashtra main vistaarit hua tha
 Among them, the association or republic of blind people was very famous
 krishna isi sangh ke sadsy the atev shantipurv main unhen ardhabhokta rajanya kaha gaya he
 It is known that this chain of republics on both banks of the Indus river had spread from the top to the lower Saurashtra as many of the ganas of this type are also described in the region called Sindh
 inamen muchakarna, brahminak or shudrak mukhya the
 Substantial material is also available in relation to Indian republic
 gana ke nirmaan kii ikai kul thi
 One person from each clan was a member of the assembly
 use kulavruddh yaa panini ke anusaar gotra kehete the
 He was also called noun
 praaia: ye rajanya yaa kshatriya jati ke hi vyakti hote the
 The number of such clans was fixed by tradition in each gana, such as the organization of the Lichchhaganas consisted of 7707 clans or clans
 unke prayek kulavruddh kii sangheey oopaadhi raja hoti thi
 Describing the ruling and ruling rule in the council, it is clear that in imperial rule, power rests in the hands of a person
 kintu gana shashan main prayek parivaar main ek ek raja hota he
 
 iske atirikt do baaten or kahi gai hai
 One is that the welfare of the subjects is spread far and wide in Ganesha

 yadi phool tane se jude nahin hote or unka nirmaan paton par hota he to unhen avrint kaha jaataa he jab phool kaa pushpan hota he, to use ek phuleey pushpan kaha jaataa he
 If the flowering flower ends in clusters of flowers, then each trunk that carries the flower is called pedicel
 pushpan vaala tana ek antak rup srujit karata hai jise phool kii kursi yaa uskaa patr kehete hai phool ke hisse patr ke upar vorl main vyavasthit hote hai
 The four main parts of the whorl are as follows: yaddapi upar varnit phulon kii sanrachana ko 'adarsh' sanrachanaatmak yojana mana ja saktaa he, parantu paudhon kii jati is yojana se hatakar badlaav ke vyapak bhinnata ko dikhaate hai
 These changes are very important in the development of flowering plants and botanists use it intensively to establish the relationship between plant species
 masalan phool-paudhon ki do upjatiyaan kaa bhed unke prayek vorl ke phuleey ango ko lekar ho saktaa he: ek dwibipatri ke vorl main adarsh rup main chaar yaa paanch ang hote hai or monocoteledon main teen yaa teen ke gunank vaale ang hote hai
 a group pistil may have only two carpels, or may not be related to the generalization of monocots and dicots given above
 jaisaa ki upar varnit kiya gaya he ki vyaktik phulon ke zyaadaatar naslon main jayang or punkesar dona hote hai
 Botanists describe these flowers as complete, bisexual, hermaphrodite
 phir bhi kuch paudhon ki naslon main phool apurna yaa ek lingeey hote hai: yaa to keval punkesar yaa strikesar angon ko dhaaran kiya hue
pehle maamle main agar ek vishesh paudha jo ki yaa to maadaa yaa purush he to aisi nasl ko dioisius mana jaataa he
 But if a sexual male or female flower appears on the same plant, such a species is called monoecious
 mul yojana se phulon ke badlaav par atirikt vichaar-vimarsh kaa ullekh phulon ke mul bhaagon vaale lekhon main kiya gaya he
 In species where there is more than one flower at the same peak, which is also called a joint flower - a collection of such flowers is also known as inflorescence, with the term having a specific arrangement on the stem of the flower
 can go
 is sambandh main dhyaan dene kaa abhyaas kiya janaa chahie ki "phool" kya he
 For example, in botany terminology, a daisy or a sunflower is not a flower but a flower has a head - a flower that holds many small flowers, each of these flowers will be described in the same physical way as they describe
 Has been done above
 bahut se phulon main avyav sanyog hota he, agar bahya bhaag kendriya shikhar se kisi bhi bindu par vibhajit hota he, to do sumail aadhe hisse srujit hote hai- to unhen niyat yaa samandharmee kaha jaataa he
 Eg rose or trillium
 When the flowers divide and form only a line that forms the components, such flowers are irregular or zygomorphic eg snapdragon / majus or mostly orchids
 ek phool kaa formula, ek tarika he jisase ek phool kii sanrachana kaa pratinidhitiv ek vishesh akshar, ank yaa pratik ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Instead of a particular species, a general formula is used to indicate the flowering structure of a plant family
 nimnlikhit pratinidhiyon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Ca = diaphragm Ca5 = Dalipule = petals in coefficient of some three) and NBSP; And NBSP; And NBSP; And NBSP; z if added zygomorphic a = stamens g = gynoecium x: "char sankhya" kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa ∞: anekon kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa The floral formula will look like this: kai atirikt chinhon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he The primary purpose of flowering is reproduction
 Flowers are reproductive organs that mediate sperm from linking pollen to the ovule / testicles, normally from one plant to another, but many plants can pollinate their own flowers
 urvar paryand bijon kaa nirmaan karte hai jo kii aage kii pusht / peedhee hai
 Sexual reproduction produces unique offspring, ready to adapt
 phulon kii ek vishisht sanrachana hoti he jo kii unhen ek hi nasl ke paraag ko ek paudhe se dusre paudhe main sthantarit karne ke liye prerit karti he
 Many plants depend on external factors for the transfer of pollen between flowers, including air and animals, especially pests
 Very large animals such as birds, bats, and dwarf poses can also be employed / employed / used
 The period of time in which this process takes place is called anthesis
 ko aakarshith karti hai
 Plants cannot move from one place to another, so many flowers grow in a dispersed population to attract animals to transfer pollen to each flower
 phool jo ki kit-paraagit hote hai unhen kitapargeey kaha jaataa hai jo kii latin main kit-premi ke rup main liya jaataa he
 These can be significantly modified with insects pollinated by co-development, usually in different parts of the flower there are glands called sweet organs that attract animals that are looking for nutritious sweet
 pakshiyon or madhumakhiyon main rang drushti hoti he, jo ki unhen "rangile" phool dhundne main yogya banaate hai
 Some flowers have madhuras directors / directives that show pollinators looking for madhuras, which can only be seen in ultraviolet light, which is visible only to bees and insects
 phool paraagan kartaaon ko gandh or kuch gandh hamaare soonghney kii shakti ke liye bhi sukhad hote hai
 The smell of all flowers does not appeal to humans, many flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh, and flowers that smell like dead animals, often called carrion flowers, include reflexia, titanarum and Paupau of North America
 phool jo ki raat ke aagantukon dwaara paraagit hote hai, sambhavit he ko ve paraagan kartaaon ko aakarshith karne ke liye apane gandh par dhyaan kendrit karte hai aise phool zyaadaatar safed hote hai
 Still others use mimicry to attract pollinators, for example the flowers of some species of some orchids match the color, shape and fragrance of bees
 nar madhumakhi aise hi phulon main se ek phool se dusre phool par saathi kii talash main ghoomte rahete hai
 The mechanism of pollination by the plant depends on how pollination is used
 adhikansh phool apane paraagan ke tareeke ko lekar mote taur par do samoohon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 Insectivorous: Flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another
 zyaadaatar ve aakaaron / roopon main visheshgy hote hai or punkesar kii aisi vyavastha hoti he ki yah sunishchit ho jaataa he ki paraag ke daanen paraagan par sthaanantarit ho jaayen jab vah apane aakarshith vastu par utarataa he kai phulon kii ek hi prajati ke is aakarshneey vastu ko paane ke liye, paragankarta un sabhi phulon main paraag ko stigma main sthantarit kar detaa he jo kii bilkul sateek rup se samaan rup main vyavasthit hote hai
 Many flowers rely only on the proximity between the parts of the flower for pollination
 anya jaise kii sarasenia yaa maadaa sleeper orchid ke paas i sunishchit dhaancha hota he jo ki aatmaparagan kaa nirodh karte hue paraagan ko nishchit karata he
 Aphrodisiac flowers: Use of air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, rag grasses of Amboria species and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators due to which they do not have a tendency to 'showy flowers'
 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 Bees and bumblebees actively accumulate aerated pollen corns, although they are not of much importance
 kuch phool swaparagit hote hai or un phulon kaa istemaal karte hai jo kabhi nahin khilte, yaa phool khilne se pehle swaparagit jo jate hai, in phulon ko clisotogamas kaha jaataa he kai prakaar ke viola or salvia prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific types of bacteria
 udahaaran ke liye kai phool ek vishisht keet jati se keval ek keet ko hi aakarshith karte hai, atah safal prajnan ke liye keval us keet par nirbhar karte hai
 This close relationship is often taken as an example of coexistence, as flowers and pollinators are believed to grow over a long period to match each other's needs
 ye ghanisht sambandh vilopan ke nakaaratmak prabhaav ke rup main yogic ho jate hai
 In such a relationship, the deletion of even one means that the deletion of almost the other member also
 The reason for some endangered plant species is a decrease in the population of dying pollinators
 kuch phulon main punkesar or strikesar donon swanishechan main sakasham hote hai, jo ki bijon ke utpaadan ke avasar badha detaa he parantu anuvanshik vividhta ko simit kar detaa he
 Extreme cases of self-fertilization occur in flowers that are always self-fertile, such as many miscreants
 In contrast, many plant breeds have their own ways of preventing self-fertilization
 ek hi paudhe par ek langeey nar or maadaa phool ek hi samay par dikhalaai nahin padate athwa paripakv nahin hote pichley prakaar ke phool, jinamein swayan ke paraag main rasinic avrodh hote hai, aise phulon ko atmamrit athwa baanjh ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he, bhi dekhen) In Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan haalaanki jamini / dharti par ke paudhe 425 million saal tak astitv main rahe hai, pratham jo kii apane samakakshon sporce se ek saadhaaran anukulan dwaara paidaa hue the
 Sea plants and some animals can spread their own genetic imitations that can be created / developed elsewhere
 Thus the early plants were bred

 Apparently the relatively sudden appearance of fossil plants in fossil history posed a problem with the theory of evolution, which was called the "disgusting mystery" by Charles Darwin

 Recent DNA analyzes) show that the Amborella trichopoda "found in the Pacific islands of New Caledonia, belongs to a group of other flowering plants, and morphological studies suggest that all of them in character Features / qualities that were in early flowering plants
 aam dharna yah he ki prarambh se hi phulon kaa kaary, pashuon ko prajnan prakriya main shaamil karnaa rahaa he
 Pollen can disintegrate even without bright / golden and clear appearance, so it becomes an obligation to use the plant's resources until it provides no other benefit
 a proposed reason for the sudden presence of fully grown flowers is that they have evolved in a different environment, such as an island or chain of islands, where the plants that held them had a highly specialized relationship with certain animals
 Have evolved from, as in present-day / today, insular breeds / ethnicity
 ek pariklpit tataiye kaa paraag ke saath kaalpanik sambandh jo ki ek paudhe se dusre paudhe tak paraag le jaataa he, aaj ke anjir tataiye ke jaisaa he, ho saktaa he ki yah paudhe or uske saathi ke bich ucch str ki visheshta kaa parinaam ho
 Island genetics is considered as a common source of characterization, especially when it comes to fundamental / initial adaptation / adaptation
 Internal transition forms are needed

 Likewise, many fruits that are used in the reproduction of the plant come from the expansion of the parts of the flower, often the fruit is a device that depends on the animals that want to eat it, thus scattering those seeds
 Who are in that fruit

 In a simple model, the activities of the three genes connect to each other in a concomitant manner to determine the developmental identity of the parent organ of the flowering meristem
 in jin kii kriyaaon ko a / i, ba / bi, or sa / si- jin kriya kaha jaataa he
 In the first flower whorl, only A-jeans are expressed, which lead to the formation of sepals
 dusre vorl main i- or bi- genes byakt hote hai, jo kii pankhudiyon ke nirmaan kaa netritv karte hai
 In the third whorl, b and c jeans are joined together to form the middle of the stem and flower, c alone generates carpels

 The pattern of species distribution in geographic areas can usually be explained through a combination of historical factors such as: globalization, extinction, continental drift, and glaciation By looking at the geographic distribution of species, we can see sea levels, river routes, You can see related variations in habitat, and river occupation

 jeevani vigyaan se adhik poochta he ki koun si prajatiyaan hai or kahaan hai? yah bhi kyon poochta he? or, kabhi-kabhi zyada mahatvapurn kyon he, kyon nahin?" Modern biology often uses geographic information systems to understand the factors affecting the distribution of organisms, and predicts future trends in organism distribution

 This diversity in habitat allows for a wide range of species studies in different parts of the world

 It is noteworthy that the apprenticeship model is being implemented in many countries of the world

 Whereas in a vast country like India, only 3 lakh trainees are present

 It is to be noted that in these, skilled labor etc
 of graduate engineers, diplomas and certificate holders will be developed
 dhyatavya he ki pichley kuch dashakon ke dauraan prashikshu prashikshan yojana kaa pradarshan bharat kii arthvyavastha ke anuroop nahin rahaa he
 Apart from this, it has also been found that the training facilities available in industries are not being used properly and due to which unemployed youth are deprived of the benefits of ATS
 aties ke vishay main praapt shikayaton ke aadhaar par prashikshu adhinium, 1961 ke praavdhaanon main varsh 2014 main kuch sanshodhan kiye gaye hai
 These amendments took effect from December 22, 2014
 vrihad rup main uparokt sanshodhano kaa uddeshy yah sunishchit karnaa he ki niyoktaaon dwaara ek badi sankhya main prashikshuon kii niyukti kii ja sake
 Apart from this, emphasis will also be given on encouraging employers under the amendments so that they sincerely comply with the trainee related Acts
