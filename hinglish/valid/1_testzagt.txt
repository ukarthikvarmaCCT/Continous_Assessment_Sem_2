 sanskrit kaa vyakaran vaidic kaal main hi swatantra vishay ban chukaa tha
 Names, Notables, Prefixes and Nipts - These four basic facts had found their place in grammar before Yask
 panini ke pehle kai vyakaran likhe ja chuke the jinamein keval apishali or kashkritsn ke kuch sutara aaj uplabdh hai
 But the hierarchical history of Sanskrit grammar begins with Panini
 vyakaran shaastra kaa vrihad itihaas he kintu mahamuni panini or unke dwaara pranit ashtadhai hi iskaa kendra bindu hai
 Panini arranged the rules of language by composing 3995 sutras in Ashtadhyayi, compilation of terms in sentences, nature of posts, suffix department and creation of posts, etc
 are the key elements
 in niyamon kii purtti ke liye dhaatu paath, gana paath tathaa unadi sutara bhi panini ne banaaye

 Under Navya grammar, the scriptures are studied according to the process sequence, in which the study of the texts of Acharyas like Bhattojidixit, Nagesh Bhatt etc
 is the main
 pracheen vyakaran evam navy vyakaran do swatantra vishay hai
 Panini composed Ashtadhyayi for both Vedic Sanskrit and Cosmic Sanskrit

 are subtle and scientific like the laws of mathematics

 rachanaatmak kaary ko prakriya arthath saiddhanthik bhaag jise lekhankan kaha ja saktaa he
 The process of critical work, that is, the critical part, can be called audit
 pehle pustapaalan tathaa lekhankan ke kaaryon main vishesh antar nahin mana jaataa tha
 But in today's industrial age, both bookkeeping and accounting have become separate tasks
 saadharantah agralikhit kaary pustapaalan, lekhankan tathaa ankekshan teenon ke kshetra main aa jate hai : Bookkeeping - As is clear from the above point, bookkeeping is the art of accounting of business deals in journal and ledger
 hisaab-kitaab rakhane kii saadhaaran yogyata vaala koi bhi vyakti is kaary ko suvidha ke saath kar saktaa he
 This task is just to write mechanically

 For this reason, it is said that accounting begins from where bookkeeping ends

 In short, work is the process of summarizing and analyzing

 The accountant is a well-educated person who is also clever in the work of bookkeeping
 uskaa kaary antim khate banaakar tarkpurna adhyayan karnaa hai
 According to various authors the definitions of audit are as follows: 1
 epa aar em di paula- ankekshan kaa arth chittha tathaa laabh-haani khate or unase sambandhit pustakon, khaaton tathaa pramankon kii jaanch karne se he taaki ankekshak apane aapako santusht kar sake or eemaandaaree se yah report de sake ki chittha niyamanusaar banaaya gaya he or vyapaar kii sahi tathaa thik sthiti ko prakat karata he jaisaa ki soochnaaon, spashtikarnon evam pustakon ke aadhaar par dekha gaya he jo use mili hai

 Spicer and Pagler- "an audit of a number of books, accounts and certifiers of a business institution is called an audit, on the basis of which the auditor can say satisfactorily, based on the explanations and information received by him and which is revealed in the books
" According to him, the letter of the institution shows its 'financial condition' and the profit and loss account of the institution's profit and loss in true and true form
 yadi nahin to kin-kin baton se vah asantusht he or kyon
 ' 5
 josef lankaster- jaanch, pramann va satyaapan kii aisi prakriya ankekshan kehalaati he jiske dwaara chitthey kii shuddhta kaa pataa chalata he
 Thus, it can be conveniently said that there is a research of audit forms, certifiers and books of accounts from which books are written, in respect of the audit sheets and other prospectus which are made from these books, its report Give it to those who have appointed him to report

 Arthur W
 Holmes -

 ronaald e iris- 'vartmaan rup main ankekshan pustakon, pramankon evam anya aarthik va kanoonee lekhon kii niyamit or vaigyanik jaanch he, jisase vaastaviktaaon kaa sampaadan kiya ja sake tathaa laabh-haani khate se prakat shuddh aay or chitthey se prakat hone vaali aarthik sthiti ke sambandh main report di ja sake

 The purpose of this investigation is to find out whether the letter and profit-loss account of the organization created for a certain time reveals its true and correct position
 ' 9
 AW Hanson - Auditing of such articles is called auditing so that they can be believed and the details given by them can also be believed
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par nishkarsh rup me- Auditing is the specific and discreet examination of the books of account of a business organization, which is done by a qualified and impartial person with the help of certifiers, forms, information and explanations received from the institution, so that the auditor remains for a fixed time
 In relation to the accounting, we can report that, sanstha- ankekshan kisi bhi sanstha ke hisaab-kitaab kaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Independent person - The audit work should be done by someone who does not have any connection with the business or institution
 tabhi nishpaksh jaanch sambhav he
 Hence presently Chartered Accountants have been appointed
 jaanch kaa swaroop- ankekshan dwaara kii gayi jaanch sirf ganit se sambandhit shuddhta ko hi prakat nahin karti balki yah ek budhimattapurna nishpaksh jaanch he jo hisaab kii purna shuddhta darshaati he
 Accounting books - Auditing involves checking the books of account
 ankekshak ko apana kaaryakshetra sirf pustakon tak hi simit nahin karnaa hota he balki anya vaidhanik pustaken tathaa vibhinn tathyon kii jaankaree bhi kerani hoti hai
 Authenticators and Forms - Audit books are checked on the basis of certifiers and forms, if they are not available, they are confirmed by copies
 soochna evam spashtikaran- jaanch kaa aadhaar pramank hi hote hai phir bhi ankekshak yaaden pramank se santusht nahin he to len-denon kaa satyaapan karne ke liye suchnaayen tathaa spashtikaran maang saktaa he
 Intelligence - The work of investigation done by audit is very important, so in this work intelligence and cleverness are required which is gained from the experience of this work
 jaanch kaa uddeshy- lekha-pustakon kii jaanch kaa uddeshy ek nishchit avadhi main banaaye gayi laabh-haani khate ke parinaamon ko evam ek nishchit tithi ko chitthey main darshaye gayi sampatti evam dayitvon kaa satyaapan karnaa he tathaa santushti par pramaan-patr dena hota he
 In fact, the auditor has to express his opinion on the examination of the final accounts
 niyamaanukoolta- bhartiya company adhinium, 1956 ke antargat company kaa chittha va laabh-haani khaataa banaate samay bhi kuch mahatvapurn niyamon ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 Therefore, the company auditor has to write in his report whether the letter is the norm or not
 avadhi- ankekshan saadharantah ek vittiya varsh yaa ek lekha varsh ke lekhon kaa kiya jaataa he
 If the accounts of more than one year are audited, this investigation is called research
 parinaam- lekhon kii jaanch ke baad isaki satyata va auchity ke vishay main report deni hoti he
 If the auditor is dissatisfied with anything, it clearly describes it in his report
 lekhankan anivaaryta ke rup main vyaavhaarik rup main lekhankan kaa sambandh vyavsaay ko jivit rakhane ke liye tathaa samaaj main pratishtha praapt karne hetu anivaary hai
 The following arguments can be given for this: aaj ke yug main kisi vyavsaay se hone vaale laabh athwa haani kaa sahi-sahi gyaan bina lekhankan ke sammav nahin he
 If the financial condition of the businessman is strong and the financial resources are very good, then the sale is more as a result of selling cheaper than other businessman, but only after the bankruptcy, he will know that he has sold the item for less than the cost
 vyavsaay main len-dein adhik hote hai visheshtah jahaan udhaar par maal adhik bechaa jaataa he vahaan dendaaron ke naam yaad rakhana sambhav nahin he at: lekhankan anivaary hai
 Profit or loss at the end of a certain period
 iske liye lekhankan anivaary he
 If the professional accounting books are maintained properly, then the current year's income-expenditure or profit-loss can be compared to the profit-loss of previous years
 lekhankan ke madhyam se vyapaaree ko apni vittiya sthiti kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Articles have great importance in assessment
 yadi lekhe niyamanusaar rakhe hon to yah bahut hi sahaayak siddh hote hai
 The total amount of money that a trader has to pay to a person can be obtained only from accounting
 alaabhprad kriyaaon ko chhodkar laabhprad kriyaayein prarambh karke adhik laabh kamaaya ja saktaa he tathaa yadi kaaryakshmata main kami he to unke kaarnon ko jaanakar unhen dur kiya ja saktaa he
 This work is possible only through accounting
 kisi vyavsaay main yadi uchit rup se lekha-pustaken rakhi jaati hai to us vyavsaay kii pratishtha badhati he
 Accounting also has the following benefits: lekhakarm vilasita ke rup main It is considered a luxury for small traders as they have limited requirements but at the present time it does not seem completely appropriate
 ankekshan vilasita ke rup main Still have to be used to hide the deceit in the accounts, which the auditor cannot catch despite proper cleverness and caution
 at: ankekshan nirarthak he
 On the basis of the above facts, we can say that audit is luxury in small business but it would be wrong for all businesses to call audit as luxury
 choti sansthaaon ke jahaan ek-do karmchaaree hai tathaa lekhakarm kaa kaary swami ekaaki vyapaaree yaa saajhedaar hi dekhte he at: ankekshan aavashyak nahin hai, lekin bade vyavsaay main yah laabhprad evam atyadhik aavashyak he, vilasita nahin
 No luxury of audit karmchaariyon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- ankekshan karwaane ke falswaroop karmchaaree kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi hoti he kyonki ve jaanate hai ki kaary thik se na karne par ankekshak dwaara truti pakadi ja sakati he ! Increased efficiency of employees - As a result of efficient audit, employees become efficient in their work because the auditor keeps on reporting and deficiencies in his report from time to time and also during the audit
 prabandhakon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- jab prabandhakon ko yah maaloom rahata he ki unke dwaara kiye gayi kaary par ankekshak apni report prastut karegaa jo ki sarvamaanya hogi to ve apana kaary purna eemaandaaree se karenge
 Assistants in the development of business - everyone believes in audited accounts and this increases the fame of business and provides facilities to the business from all sides which leads to the development of business
 diwalia hone kii dasha main nirnay sambhav- yadi lekha-pustaken thik prakaar rakhkar ankekshan karvaa rakhaa he to nyaayalay dwaara rin mukti aadesh praapt karne main sahaayak siddh hote hai
 In the absence of this, it may take longer
 bhavi yojana banane main sahaayak- prabandhak kai varshon ke antim khaaton ke aadhaar par tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hai tathaa yah dekhte he ki kaaryakshmata kis prakaar badhaayi ja sakati he
 Increase in plant and machine efficiency - The audit of cost accounts shows how much functionality the machines have and for what reasons the full functionality of the machines is not being used
 in kaarnon kii jaankaree praapt karkekaryakshmata ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Inevitability of audit ankekshan se kaaryakshmata par prabhaav padataa hai at: ise vilasita nahin kaha ja saktaa hai
 In the following situations it is mandatory - is prakaar yah kahana purnroop se satya na hoga ki lekhankan anivaary he or ankekshan vilasita hai
 Accounting is also a luxury in small businesses, while it is compulsory for large businesses
 kintu phir bhi lekhankan va ankekshan ek sikke ke do pahalu hai
 If there is no accounting, then whose audit will be done
 or lekhankan sirf akelaa ho to uski satyata kii vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 Making errors is a part of human nature, the main purpose of audit is to detect and prevent inaccuracy and embezzlement
 ankekshak trutiyon kaa pataa lagane hetu praarambhik lekhon kii jaanch, jarnal kii jaanch, rocked shesh kii jaanch, khaaton ke sheshon kii jaanch, sahaayak bahiyon kii khatauni kii jaanch, gat varsh ke talapat se milan, antar kii raashi kaa pataa lagaana, talapat ke jod kii jaanch aadi kriya apana saktaa hai
 If the auditor used so much care, skill and intelligence in his work as was the case in those circumstances and he had done his utmost, which was absolutely necessary to find the errors
 yadi phir bhi kapat kaa pataa lagane main asamarth rahaa ho to ankekshak ko uttaradaayi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa hai
 Auditing work never means that the auditor has insured the inaccuracies and embezzlement, nor does he guarantee that all the impurities and embezzlement will be found
 usase sirf yah apeksha kii jaati he ki vah apana kaary uchit saavdhaanee evam chaturaai se karegaa

 The credibility and adequacy of accounting records and other information should be checked using various methods to form an opinion on the financial statements

 The auditor starts the work by setting limits to his work
 aisi do seemayen hai :-vistrut seemaa, gahan seemaa
 In the broadest range, the auditor decides how many behaviors to be audited, while in the deepest range it determines which behaviors to examine and how deeply to examine

 satyanarayan bhagwaan kii katha lok main prachlit he
 Satyanarayana Vrat Katha is the true form of Lord Vishnu as the most revered fast story among Hindu religious leaders
 kuch log manauti puri hone par, kuch anya niyamit rup se is katha kaa aayojan karte hai
 There are two parts of the story of Satyanarayana, fast-worship and story
 satyanarayan vratakatha skandapurana ke revakhand se sankalit kii gai he
 Satya came to Narayan position
 kashtha-vikreta bhil bhi ati nirdhan tha
 Somehow he used to feed his family and his family by selling wood
 usne bhi sampoorn nishtha ke saath satyacharankia; satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchki
 King Ulkamukhi was also a loyal Satyavrathe
 ve niyamit rup se bhadrashilandi ke kinare sapatnik satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchkarte the
 Satyacharanhi was the origin of his life
 duusari taraf sadhu vanik evam raja tungadhjaswarthbadhakoti ke satyavrathithe
 Both these characters, being forced to selfish means, satyacharanakya; Satyanarayana worshiped God
 sadhu vanik kii satyanarayan bhagwaan main nishtha nahin thi
 After taking the resolution of Satyanarayana Poojarchaka, Kalavatinamak kanya-ratna was born in his family
 kanyajanmake pashchaat usne apane sankalp ko bhula diya or satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchanhin kii
 He postponed Pooja till the marriage of the girl
 kanya ke vivaah-avasar par bhi usne satyacharanevam puujarchaase munh mod liya or damaad ke saath vyapaar-yatra par chal pada
 Due to the incident, the father-in-law was accused of theft in Ratnasarpur
 yahaan unhen raja chandraketuke karagaar main rahanaa pada
 When the father-in-law and son-in-law were freed from prison, Shvasur lied to a Dandiswamy that his boat contained only Ratnadin, not a letter
 is mithyavadanke kaaran use sampatti-vinaash kaa ksht bhogana pada
 Finally obliged, he gave a fast to Lord Satyanarayana
 sadhu vanikke mithyaachaar ke kaaran uske ghar par bhi bhayankar chori ho gai
 Wives-son-in-law
 isi bich unhen sadhu vanikke sakushal ghar lautne kii soochna mili
 At that time Kalavati was worshiping Lord Satyanarayana with her mother Lilavati
 samachar sunate hi kalavatiapane pita or pati se milane ke liye daudi
 She forgot to receive the Lord's Prasad in the same manner
 prasad na grahan karne ke kaaran sadhu vanikaur uske damaad naav sahit samudr main dub gaye
 Then suddenly Kalavati remembered his mistake
 vah daudi-daudi ghar ai or bhagwaan kaa prasad liya
 After that everything went well
 lagbhag yahi sthiti raja tungadhijki bhi thi
 At one place Gopabandhu Bhagwan was worshiping Satyanarayana

 antat:baadhya hokar unhone satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchki or satyacharanka vrath liya
 The five characters mentioned above in the Satyanarayana fasting story are not just Kathapatriahi, they symbolize two humanistic tendencies
 ye pravritiyaan hai, satyagrah evam mithyaagrah
 Sarvadin remains the holder of both tendencies in the world
 in paatro ke madhyam se skandapuranayah sandesh dena chahta he ki nirdhan evam sattahinavyakti bhi satyagrahi, satyavrati, satyanishth ho saktaa he or dhan tathaa sattasampannavyakti mithyagrahiho saktaa he
 Shatanand and the wood seller Bhil were poor and powerless
 phir bhi inamen teevr satyagrahavrittithi
 In contrast, the monks and monarchs Tungadhvajadhansampan and Sattasampanathe were
 par unki vritti mithyagrahithi
 Such a phenomenon is rare in a person with power and wealth
 satyanarayan vratakthake paatr raja ulkamukhisi hi viral koti ke vyakti the
 The implication of the entire Satyanarayana fasting story is that a man should take a fast of satyacharan for the spiritual and other spiritual practices
 satya hi, bhagwaan he
 Truth is Vishnu
 lok main sari buraaiyon, saare cleshon, saare sangharsho kaa mul kaaran he satyacharanka abhaav
 The verse in the story of Satyanarayana Vrat is as follows: Yatkrutvasarvadu: Khebhyo Muktobhavatimanava: visheshat:kaliyugesatyapujafalaprada
 Ketch Kaalvandishyantasamyamanthamavach

 That is, by performing the ritual of Satyanarayana fast, a person is free from all sorrows

 Satya has many names, such as Satyanarayana, Satyadev
 sanathan satyarupivishnu bhagwaan kaliyug main anek rup dhaaran karke logon ko manovanchit fal denge
 By performing the ritual of Satyanarayana fast, man is freed from all sorrows
 kalikaal main satya kii puja vishesh rup se faldaayihoti he satya ke anek naam hai, yatha-satyanarayan, satyadev
 Lord Sanatan Satyarupi Vishnu will take many forms in Kali Yuga and give desired results to the people

 In almost every story, the thinking of the characters was dominated by events
 ek aadim raatri kii mahak iskaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 In Renu's stories and novels, he has successfully tried to tie words to every tune, every scent, every rhythm, every rhythm, every sound, every beauty and every ugliness of the regional life

 It is rare to find an example of the fame Renu got in Hindi literature from her novel Maaila Aanchal
 is upanyaas ke prakaashan ne unhen rato-raat hindi ke ek bade kathakaar ke rup main prasiddh kar diya
 Some critics were not too late to declare it the second best Hindi novel after Godan

 Although some archaeologists and geologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought, probably 1 billion years ago
 Fossil insignia such as trails and burrows found in the Tonian era indicate the presence of three-dimensional worms such as metazoa
 Likely earthworms would have been large and complex

 The diversity that currently informs the arrival of animals grazing as stromatolites increased diversity, shortly after the end of the Ordovician and Permian, causing large numbers of grazing marine animals to become extinct in their populations
 Shortly after the recovery, their number decreased

 The earliest Indian colony in the erstwhile Indochina peninsula was established in the Funan region around the first century AD
 lagbhag 600 varshon tak phunaan ne is pradesh main hindu samskruti kaa prachaar evam prasar karne main mahatvapurn yoga diya
 Subsequently, a great kingdom of Kambuj or Kambhoj was established in this region, whose glorious tradition of wonderful opulence continued till the 14th century AD
 is pracheen vaibhav ke avshesh aaj bhi angkorwat, angkorthom naamak sthanon main vartmaan hai
 According to the ancient legends of Kamboj, the foundation of this colony was laid by King Kambu Swayambhuva of 'aryadesh'
 vah bhagavan shiv kii prerana se kamboj desh main aae or yahan basii hui naag jati ke raja kii sahaayta se unhone is junglee marusthal main ek nayaa rajya basaaya jo nagaraj kii adbhut jaaduugari se hare bhare, sundar pradesh main parinat ho gaya
 Kambu married Nagaraj's daughter Mera and laid the foundation of the Kambuj dynasty
 yah bhi sambhav he ki bhartiya kamboj se bhi indochin main sthit is upnivesh kaa sambandh rahaa ho
 In the third century AD, an ambassador of Murunds who had settled on the northwestern border of India reached Funan and probably brought the horse of Kamboj with them
 kamboj ke pratham aitihaasik rajvansh kaa sansthaapak shrutvarman tha jisane kamboj desh ko phunaan kii adheenta se mukt kiya
 His son Shresthavarman settled the capital named Shresthapur in his name whose ruins are located near Watfu hill in Laos
 tatpashchaat bhavavarman ne, jiskaa sambandh phunaan or kamboj donon hi rajwanshon se tha, ek nayaa vansh chalaaya or apane hi naam bhavapur naamak rajdhani basaai
 The development of Kamboj begins with the time of Bhavavarman and his brother Mahendravarman
 phunaan kaa purana rajya ab jeernsheern ho chukaa tha or sheeghra hi is nae durgharsh samrajya main villin ho gaya
 After Mahendravarman's death, his son Ishaanavarman ascended the throne
 is pratapi raja ne kamboj rajya kii simaaon kaa dur-dur tak vistaar kiya
 He established diplomatic relations with India and Champa and built a new capital named Ishanpur
 ishanvarman ne champa ke raja jagaddharm ko apni putree byaahi thi jiskaa putr prakashdharm apane pita kii mrityu ke pashchaat champa kaa raja hua
 This suggests that Champa was under the political influence of Kamboj at this time
 ishanvarman ke baad bhavavarman dwitiya or jayavarman pratham kamboj nareshon ke naam milte hai
 This dynasty came to an end in 674 AD after Jayavarman

 The Kamboj history of the 8th century AD is not very clear, but as soon as the beginning of the 9th century, the power of this ancient empire resurfaced
 iskaa shrey jayavarman dwitiya ko diya jaataa he
 He laid the foundation of Angkor dynasty and liberated Kamboj from the subjugation of Java

 Jayavarman II was named Kambujarajendra and his Maharani under the name Kambujarajalakshmi during his time
 isi samay se cambodia ke pracheen naam kambuj yaa kamboj kaa videshi lekhakon ne bhi prayog karnaa prarambh kar diya tha
 Even after Jayavarman II, the empire of Kamboj continued to grow and grow and within a short time the empire of Kamboj spread throughout the Indochina peninsula

 In 944 AD, Rajendravarman was the king of Kamboj, whose large inscriptions of the time are found written in beautiful Sanskrit poetry

 Suryavarman i established Kamboj's suzerainty over almost all of Siamese and also invaded the southern Brahmadesh
 vah sahitya, nyaay or vyakaran kaa pandit tha tathaa swayan buddha hote hue bhi shaiva or vaishnav dharmon kaa premi or sangrakshak tha
 He tried to reinvigorate the state by ending the civil war in the country at the time of his coronation
 uttari champa ko jitkar suryavarman ne use kamboj kaa karad rajya bana liya kintu sheeghra hi dakshin champa ke raja jayahari varman se haar manani padi
 At this time there was a lot of unrest in Cambog due to civil wars and conflicts with neighboring countries
 jayavarman saptam ke rajyakaal main pun: ek baar kamboj kii pracheen yash:pataakaa fahraane lagi
 He formed a large army which included the soldiers of Siamese and Brahmadesh

 But even then Jayavarman VII is counted among the great rulers of Kamboj as it was during that time that the expansion of the empire of Kamboj reached its extreme limit
 jayavarman saptam ne apni nai rajdhani vartmaan angkorthom main banaai thi
 Its ruins are still counted among the famous ancient relics of the world

 It is known from an inscription at this time that there were 789 temples and 102 hospitals and 121 hospital houses in Kamboj
 jayavarman saptam ke pashchaat kamboj ke itihaas ke anek sthal adhik spasht nahin hai
 In the 13th century, Kamboj lacked strong political power
 kuch itihasalekhakon ke anusaar kamboj ne 13veen sadi ke antim charan main china ke samrat kuble khan kaa aadhipaty maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 a messenger Angkorthom arrived from China in 1296 AD, a member of which shu-tan-kuan wrote a detailed and entertaining account of the then Kambos which was translated into French in 1902 AD
 14veen sadi main kamboj ke padosi rajyon main nai raajnneetik shakti kaa udai ho rahaa tha tathaa syam or champa ke thai log kamboj kii ore badhane kaa nirantar prayaas kar rahe the
 The result was that there was a lot of pressure from two sides on Kamboj and it started to crush between the millstones of these two countries
 dhire-dhire kamboj kii pracheen mahatta samaapt ho gai or ab yah desh indochin kaa ek saadhaaran pichhadaa hua pradesh banakar rah gaya
 In the 19th century, French influence increased in Indochina; By the way, they came to this peninsula in the 16th century itself and were looking for an opportunity to increase their power
 vah avasar ab or 1854 i
 main kamboj ke nirbal raja ankaduong ne apana desh francisiyon ke haathon saunp diya

 Cambodia's influential King Noradam Sinhanuk continued his national movement against it
 inke praytn se cambodia sheeghra hi swatantra raashtra ban gaya or ye apane desh ke pratham pradhan mantri chune gaye
 Kamboj was an Indian colony in real sense

 Hinduism and Vaishnavism and then Buddhism were the kingship of Kambhoj and many Sanskrit inscriptions here would find it difficult to separate them from the Indian inscriptions due to their religious and mythological cultural background

 Acid is a chemical compound which dissolves in water to give hydrogen ions
 iskaa ph maan 7
0 se kam hota he
 According to the modern definition given by Johannes Nicholas Bronstedt and Martin Laurie, acid is the chemical compound that provides hydrogen ions to the repulsive compound
 jaise- asitic amla or salphurik amla 
 amla, thos, drav yaa gas, kisi bhi bhautik avasthaa main paae ja sakate hai
 They can live in pure form or in slurry form
 jis padaarth yaa yogic main amla ke gun paae jate hai ve kehalaate hai
 Acidity or acidity is a disease caused by excess of hydrochloric acid in the human bowel
 amla un padaarthon ko kehete hai jo pani main ghulne par khattey swaad ke hote hai, haldi se bani roli ko pilaa kar dete hai,tathaa inkaa jaleey vilyan nile litmus paper ko laal karata he
 Most metals react with hydrogen to produce gas, and neutralize the base
 mote hisaab se ksharak un padaarthon ko kehete hai jinka vilyan chikna-chikna sa lagata he, swaad kadva hota he, haldi ko laal kar dete hai or amlon ko udasin karte hai
 To neutralize means to make a substance which has neither the properties of acid nor of base
 lavaazie ne oxygen ke gunon kaa adhyayan karte samay dekha ki carbon, gandhak or phosphorus sadrush tatv jab oxygen main jalte hai tab unase bane oxide jal ke saath milakar amla banaate hai
 They reached the result that there is oxygen in acids and oxygen is the cause of acidic acid
 isi kaaran is gas kaa naam "oxygen" padaa, jiskaa arth hota he "amla banaanevaala padaarth" tathaa isi kaaran german bhashaa main oxygen ko "sir staf" arthath amla padaarth kehete hai
 Lavaziye divided acids into two classes, inorganic acids and organic acids
 peeche dekha gaya ki kuch tatwon ke oxide pani main ghulkar amla nahin balki kshar banaate hai or kuch amlon main oxygen bilkul nahin hota
 Bertile invented hydrocyanic acid in 1787, Davy invented hydrochloric acid in 1810–11 and hydriodic acid in 1813
 inamen se kisi main oxygen nahin he
 It has been observed later that the substances which are completely dry do not have any acidic reaction
 tab logon ne amlon ko do virgon main vibhakt kiya, ek hydro-amla or doosraa oxy-amla
 Back in 1815, Dewey suggested that the acidicity of acids is not due to oxygen, but due to hydrogen
 duulang ne san 1815 main oxylik amla kaa adhyayan kiya or is parinaam par pahunche ki oxynwaale or bina oxynwaale amlon main koi bhed nahin he
 Acids do not have any properties that we can call specific characteristics of acids
 saadhaaran gun upar bataae ja chuke hai
 In acid and metal reactions, one, or more, hydrogen atoms of an acid molecule are displaced by metals, metal oxides, hydroxides or carbonates
 aise bhi kuch amla hai jo khattey hone ke badale mithe hote hai
 One such acid is amido-phosphoric acid
 kuch aise bhi amla hai jo ksharhar nahin hote
 There are also some alkalis whose hydrogen is displaced by metals
 fitkaree amla nahin he
 There is also no hydrogen to be displaced
 par yah swaad main khatta or kriya main ksharhar hota he
 It also turns blue litmus to red
 isi prakaar sodium baislphide khatta or ksharhar hota he
 It turns blue litmus red
 isamen visthapit honevaala hydrogen bhi he, par yah amla nahin he
 Methane is not an acid, but its hydrogen is displaced by zinc and thus zinc is dimethyl which is not a salt
 at: amla kii koi santoshprad paribhaasha ab tak nahin di ja saki he
 If we want to define acids on the basis of ion theory, then we can say that hydrogen ions are essential in acids
 silavian ne san 1659 main pehle pahal amlon or ksharakon main vibhed kiya tha
 In 1774, Rul gave the name base, which combines with acids to form salts
 aajkal ksharak un oxygen vaale padaarthon ko kehete hai jo amlon ke poorak hote hai
 Alkali metals, alkali metals and other metal oxides and all those things are alkalis which combine with acids to form salts
 aarambh main ksharak keval un dhaatuon athwa dhaatuon ke oxidon ke liye vyavahrat hota tha jo lavenon ke "base" yaa aadhaar the
 The bases of salts are essential components
 ksharak vastav main ve padaarth hai jo amla ke saath milakar lavan or jal banaate hai
 For example, zinc oxide combines with sulfuric acid to form zinc sulfate and water
 daahak soda salfurik amla ke saath milakar sodium sulphate or jal banaata he
 Oxides of metals are generally base
 par iske apwaad bhi hai
 The bases contain metal oxides and hydroxides, but for convenience some groups of elements are also formed which combine with acids to form salts without water
 aise ksharakon main ammonia, hydraxylemin or phosphin hai
 Fluid dissolves ammonia but gives no color with phenolphthalein
 at: kahan tak yah ksharak kaha ja saktaa he, yah baat sandigdh he
 Although the definition of the base above is very unsatisfactory, it has not given a good definition
 ksharak or kshar paryaayavachi jaabd nahin hai
 All bases are bases but not all bases are bases
 kshar-dhaatuon ke oxide, jaise sodium oxide, jal main ghulkar hydraksaide banaate hai
 They are strongly basic
 kshareey mrudadhatuon ke oxide, jaise kellisyam oxide, jal main alp viley or alp kshareey hote hai
 Oxides of other metals do not dissolve in water and their hydroxides are made indirectly
 dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide ksharak hote hai
 Alkali metal oxides dissolve quickly in water
 kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main kam viley hote hai or kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main tanik bhi viley nahin hai
 Some nonmetal hydrides, such as hydrides of nitrogen and phosphorus are also consumed

 == Economic policies presided over the introduction of Nehru, a revised, Indian version of state planning and control over the economy
 The Planning Commission of India, Nehru Banana Up, in 1951 attracted the first five-year plan, which charted government investment in industries and agriculture
 Raising trade and income taxes, Nehru envisages a mixed economy in which the government would strategically manage industries like mining, electricity and heavy industries, serving an inquiry for public interest and private enterprise
 Nehru has adopted land redistribution and started the construction program to expand agricultural production to use irrigation canals, dams and fertilizers
 He has also pioneered a series of community development aimed at spreading diverse cottage industries and increasing efficiency in rural India

 Such as Andorra, Aland - Finland, Monaco, Svalbard - Norway, Kosovo - Serbia, Vatican City, Palestinian Territory and Hong Kong which is the exclusive administrative region in China, and many others
 Andorra could until 1993 be considered de facto to have been under dual French and Spanish rule due to the lack of clear division of powers while it was ruled by a Spanish bishop and the French president, according to a treaty
 In 1278, the conflict between the French Count and the Catalan bishop was resolved by the signing of a pareage, which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the Count of Foix and the Bishop of La Seu d'urgell 
 The pareage, a feudal institution recognizing the principle of equality of rights shared by two rulers, gave the small state its territory and political form
today Andorra is a co-principality with the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell, Spain as co-princes, in a duumvirate

 In July 1918, a treaty was signed providing for limited French protection over Monaco
 The treaty, part of the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests
 France has in many ways still control over the state
the executive branch consists of a Minister of State, who presides over a four-member Council of Government 
 The minister of state is a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government
in 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco clarified that if there are no heirs to carry on the dynasty, the principality will remain an independent nation rather than revert to France
 Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France
 The Vatican City state came into existence by virtue of the Lateran Treaty in 1929, which spoke of it as a new creation, and not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States that had previously encompassed central Italy
 Of which, most were absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860, and the city of Rome with a small area close to it, ten years later in 1870
 The state has no firm population as its citizens are only granted citizenship for the duration of service in the state
 Those without dual citizenship will then get Italian citizenship

 Hence this mood can be called second childhood

 The third season of True Blood premiered simultaneously on HBO and HBO Canada on 13 June 2010 and will have 12 episodes taking the total number of series to 36
 It follows very loosely on the plot of The Southern Vampire Mysteries' third novel, Club Dead, and introduces wolves into the program's mythology
 aarambhik prabhaavon ke mishran ke baavjood tru blad kaa aalochanatmak abhigrahan aam taur par anukool hi rahaa he
 The New York Post critic wrote of the early episodes: "if hbo's new vampire show is any indication, there will still be countless deaths - especially between vampire hunters and viewers who love them - because everyone is bored
 And so it is with hbo's new series of death-thriller Alan Ball, the creator of the legendary Six Feet Under, whose new program True Blood Yours It will not cool the blood running inside as much as it will make you numb
 " jabaki uese today ne nishkarsh nikaala: "sexi, saras or nishchit rup se ajeeb, tru blad, ek aisi duniya main set kii gai khun main lathpath dakshini gothic romantic kahani he jahaan pishaach lagbhag aaazaad hai or samaan adhikaron ke liye aandolan kar rahe hai

 Charlene Harris, the author of the book series the program is based on, stated that she initially depicted vampires as "


 a minority trying to get equal rights"
 shrinkhalaa main istemaal kiye gaye kai vaakyansh algebiti logon ke khilaaf or unke bare main istemaal kii gai abhivyaktiyon se uddhrut or roopantarit kiya gaya he, jaise - "god heats phangs" or "kaming out of da coffin" 
 Entertainment Weekly broad critic Ken Tucker wrote that the creation of the program "has been built around a series of metaphors: the rights of vampires replace the rights of gay men, and now the clever laugh emanating from this spoiled vampire girl, the teenager Represents the extremity of arrogance
 " enpiaar ke david binkuli ne likhaa " roopak kahani ke hisaab se kaaphi bada he or samaaj main pishaachon ko sweekaar karne se judi chintaa aam taur par naagarik adhikaron or khaas taur par samalangik purush adhikaron kaa ek spasht naatak he
 However, television series creator Alan Ball rebuffed critics, saying that such a comparison is a "lazy" comparison
