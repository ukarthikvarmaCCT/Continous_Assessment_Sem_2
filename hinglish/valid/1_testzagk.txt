 software pareekshan, udyog ko software ke karyanvayan main jokhim ko samajhane or saraahna karne kii anumati dene ke liye, software kaa uddeshy or swatantra avlokan bhi pradaan karata he
 Test techniques include, but are not limited to, the process of execution of a program or application with the intention of finding software bugs
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki software pareekshan vah prakriya he, jo yah vidhimaanya or satyapit karti he ki ek software program / anuprayog / utpaada: Depending on the test method employed, software testing can be implemented at any time in the development process
 baharhaal, test ke adhikansh prayaas tab shuru hote hai, jab aavashyaktaaon ko paribhaashit kar diya gaya ho or koding prakriya purna ho gai ho
 Different software development models focus the test effort at different stages in the development process
 ek adhik paaramparik model main, pareekshan ke adhikansh prayaas tab shuru hote hai, jab aavashyaktaaon ko paribhaashit kar diya gaya ho or koding prakriya purna ho gai ho
 Relatively new development models, such as Agile or XP, often use development-driven testing and assign a greater share of testing to the developer in the development process
 pareekshan, puri tarah se software ke bheetar sabhi dosha kii pahchaan nahin kar saktaa he
 Instead, it presents a critique or comparison that compares the status and behavior of the product to the norm — the principle or system by which a person can identify a problem
 in pramaniktaaon main shaamil ho sakate hai vinirdesan, anubandh, tulaneey utpaada, usee utpaada kaa pichhlaa sanskaran, niyat yaa apekshit uddeshyon kaa anumaan, upyogkarta yaa graahak kii apekshaayen, upyukt maanak, prayojya niyam, yaa anya maandand

 haalanki unka dhyaan bracoge pareekshan par tha isane software ejineering samudaay kii buniyadi vikaas gatividhiyon, jaise dibging ko satyaapan se alag karne kii ichha kii pushti kii
 Dave Gelperin and William C
 Hetzel classified the phases and goals in software testing in 1988 into the following stages: pareekshan kaa ek praathmik uddeshy, software vifaltaaon kaa pataa lagaana he, taaki dosha ko khoja or sudhara ja sake
 This is a non-negligible finding
 pareekshan yah sthapit nahin kar saktaa ki ek utpaada sabhi paristhitiyon main thik-thik kaary kar rahaa he, par sirf itnaa sthapit kar saktaa he ki yah kin vishisht paristhitiyon main thik-thik kaam nahin karata he
 The scope of software testing often includes the execution of that code in various environments and situations, as well as the investigation of aspects of that code, in addition to the examination of the code: whether it does what it should and what it does, what it does This needs to be done
 software vikaas kii vartmaan samskruti main ek pareekshan sanghathan, vikaas dal se alag ho saktaa he
 There are different roles for members of the test team
 software pareekshan se praapt jaankaree kaa prayog, us prakriya ko sahi karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jiske dwaara software kaa vikaas kiya gaya he
 Functional testing refers to a test that verifies a specific action or function of the code
 ye aam taur par code kii aavashyaktaaon ke pralekhan main paaya jaataa he, haalanki kuch vikaas prakriya, prayukt maamle yaa upyogkarta khabaron se kaam karte hai
 Functional tests answer the question "can the user do it" or "does this particular feature work"
 non-functional pareekshan, software ke un pahaluon ko darshata he, jo sambhav he ki kisi vishesh prakaarya yaa upyogkarta kii kriya, jaise arohan yaa suraksha se sambandhit naa hon
 non-functional pareekshan is tarah ke sawaalon kaa jawaab detaa he ki "ek baar main kitne log log in kar sakate hai", yaa "is software ko hack karnaa kitna aasaan he"
 Not all software flaws are caused by code errors
 mahange dosha kaa ek aam strot, apekshaaon ke interval ke kaaran panapata he, udhaaharan he, aparichit apekshaayen, jo program diziner dwaara vilopan kii trutiyon main falit hote hai
 a common source of expectation interval is non-functional expectation, such as testability, mountability, maintenance capacity, usability, performance, and security
 software dosha nimnlikhit prakriyaaon ke madhyam se hote hai
 The programmer makes an error, which results in a malfunction in the source code of the software
 yadi is karaabi ko nishpadit kiya jaataa he, to kuch khaas sthitiyon main system trutipurn parinaam degaa, jo ek vifaltaa kaa kaaran banegaa
 Not all faults will necessarily result in failure
 udhaaharan ke liye, ded code main dosha, kabhi vifaltaa main parinat nahin honge
 When the environment is changed, a breakdown can turn into a failure
 pariveshgat in parivartanon ke udaahranon main shaamil hai, software kaa ek nae hardware platform par chalaaya janaa, sorce data main parivartan yaa bhinn software ke saath parsparik kriya
 ek ekal truti, vifaltaa ke vistrut lakshan main parinat ho sakati he
 It is generally believed that the earlier a malfunction is discovered, the cheaper it is to fix
 nimnlikhit talika, karaabi ke pataa lagaae jane vaale charan ke aadhaar par, use thik karne kii laagat ko darshaati he
 For example, if a problem with expectations is revealed only after release, then the cost will be 10–100 times more than the cost of detection by reviewing the expectations
 software vifaltaa kaa ek aam kaaran, anya anuprayog, ek nae oparating system, yaa, badhate hue web brouzar sanskaran ke saath sangatta he
 In the case of a lack of backwards compatibility, this may be because the programmer considered testing their program's coding or software only on the "latest version" of this-and-that operating system
 is tathy kaa anayas nateeja yah he ki: unka naveenatam kaary, software / hardware ke purv mishran ke saath puri tarah se sangat nahin bhi ho saktaa he, yaa yah ek anya mahatvapurn oparating system ke saath puri tarah se sangat nahin ho saktaa he
 In any case, these differences, whatever they may be, would have resulted in software failure, as realized by some significant sections of computer users
 ise ek "suraksha unmukh ranneeti" maan sakate hai, jo ki dev gelprin or wiliam si
 hetzel dwaara sujhaaye naveenatam parikshan charan ke saath sateek baithta he, jaisaa ki neeche uddhrut he
 
 software pareekshan ke saath ek mukhya samasya he ki input or pre-condishan ke saare combination ke antargat pareekshan sambhav nahin he, yahan tak ki ek saamaanya utpaada ke saath bhi nahin
 This means that the number of defects in a software product can be quite high and the defects that occur occasionally are difficult to find in testing
 adhik mahatvapurn rup se, gunvattta ke gair-kaaryaatmak aayam - upyog-kshamta, arohan-kshamta, nishpaadan, sangatta, vishwasaneeyata-atyant vyaktiparak ho sakate hai; kuch aisa, jo ek vyakti ke liye paryaapt mulya kaa gathan karata he, jo duusare ke liye asahneeya he
 There are several approaches to software testing
 samiksha, aar-paar guzaarana, yaa nirikshan ko static pareekshan mana jaataa he, jabaki die gaye ek pareekshan maamle ke set ke saath vaastavik nishpadit program code dinemic pareekshan mana jaataa he
 Static testing can be omitted
 dinemic pareekshan tab prayukt hota he, jab khud program ko hi pehali baar prayog kiya ja rahaa ho 
 Dynamic testing can begin to test specific parts of the code before 100% completion of the program
 iske liye vishisht takanic hai stabs / drivers kaa prayog karnaa yaa phir ek dibgar parivesh se nishpaadan
 udhaaharan ke liye, spredshit program, khud apni prakruti dwaara, kaaphi had tak paraspar rup se jaanche jate hai, jiske tahat parinaam, prayek gananaa yaa text parichaalan ke turant baad pradarshit hote hai
 Software testing is used in association with verification and authentication: satyaapan or pramanikaran shabd kaa aam taur par prayog, udyog main antar-parivartanshiltaa se kiya jaataa he; in donon shabdon ko galat tareeke se paribhaashit karnaa bhi aam he
 According to the standard terminology of IEEE Software Engineering: software pareekshan software tester dwaara kii ja sakati he
 The term "software tester" was commonly used until the 1980s, but was later seen as a separate business
 software pareekshan main avadhiyon or vibhinn lakshyon se sambandhit vibhinn bhoomikaaon ko sthapit kiya gaya he: manager, test lead, test diziner, tester, automation develper or test administrator Although controversial, software testing can be seen as an important part of the software quality assurance process
 SQA main, software prakriya visheshgy or lekha pareekshak, software or uske vikaas par ek vyapak drushtikon rakhte hai
 They investigate the software engineering process and replace it to reduce the amount of defects in the software provided: the so-called defect rate
 ek "sweekaarya dosha dar" kaa gathan karne vaali chizein software kii prakruti par nirbhar karti hai
 For example, in an arcade video game designed to give the impression of flying an airplane, it would likely have a relatively greater tolerance for faults, compared to mission critical software used to control an airliner
 Happens, which is actually flying
 yadhyapi SQA ke saath ghanishtha sambandh hai, pareekshan vibhaag aksar swatantra rup se kaary karte hai or ho saktaa he ki kisi company main SQA kaa koi kaary naa ho
 Software testing is the task of detecting defects in software by comparing the expected results of a computer program to a given input set, compared to its actual results
 virodhabhas swaroop, QA, darasal hone vaali trutiyon ko rokane ke uddeshy se nitiyon or prakriyaaon kaa karyanvayan he
 Software testing methods have traditionally been divided into black box testing and white box testing
 in donon abhigmon kaa prayog us drushtikon ke varnan ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ek test ejeeniyar test maamalon kii digining ke liye apanaataa he
 Black box testing treats the software as a "black box" - black box testing methods without any internal implementation information include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all pairs testing, fudge testing, model-based Testing, traceability metrics, exploratory testing and specification-based testing
 isliye, blike box pareekshan main ek ore "ek asambaddh raay" kaa phayda he or duusari ore "andhi talash" kaa nuksaan
 White box testing occurs when the tester has access to algorithms, including internal data structures and the code that implements it
 ve donon ek code kawarej metric ko lautaate hai, jise pratishat ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 Gray box testing involves access to internal data structures and algorithms to design test cases, but at the user, or black box level
 Changing input data and formatting output do not fall under the gray box, since input and output are clearly out of the "black-box" that we are calling the system under test
 yah antar vishesh rup se tab mahatvapurn he, jab do alag developers dwaara likhe code ke do modulon ke bich integration pareekshan sampadit kii jaati he, jahaan pareekshan ke liye sirf interphes ko prastut kiya jaataa he
 However, modifying a data repository must fall under the gray box, since typically the user will not be able to change data outside the system under test
 grey box pareekshan main reverse ejineering bhi shaamil ho sakati he, udhaaharan ke liye, boundari vailu yaa truti sandesh nirdhaarit karne ke liye
 Tests are often classified based on their place of involvement in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test
 unit pareekshan un pareekshanon ko sanderbhit karata he, jo code ke ek vishesh khand kii kaaryashiltaa, aam taur par prakriya str par, satyapit karte hai
 In an object-oriented environment, this often occurs at the category level and involves minimal unit testing of constructors and destructors
 is prakaar ke pareekshan aam taur par developers dwaara likhe jate hai, jab ve code par kaam kar rahe hote hai, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki ek vishesh prakriya apekshanuroop thik dhang se kaam kar rahi he
 To catch corner cases or other branches in the code, a process may have multiple tests
 unit pareekshan akele, software ke ek ansh kii kaaryakshmata ko satyapit nahin kar sakati, balki iskaa prayog yah sunishchit karne ke liye hota he ki software dwaara prayukt building block, ek duusare se swatantra rup se kaary karte hai
 Integration testing is any type of software test that attempts to verify interfaces between components against a software design
 software ghatak ko, punraritiya tareeqe se yaa ek saath ekikrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The earlier approach is generally considered a better practice, as it allows interface issues to be quickly localized and fixed
 integration pareekshan, interphes main trutiyaan ujagar karne or ekikrut ghatak ke bich parsparik kriya ko darshane ke liye kaam karata he
 Progressively, large clusters of tested software components are integrated and tested to fit the elements of architectural design until the software begins to function as a system
 system pareekshan yah satyapit karne ke liye ek puri tarah se ekikrut system kaa pareekshan karata he ki vah apni aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karata he
 System Integration Testing confirms that a system is integrated with any external or other party systems defined in the system requirements
 regration pareekshan ek pramukh code parivartan ke baad dosha ko khojane par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 In particular, it attempts to uncover software regression or older bugs that have returned
 jab bhi software prakriya, jo pehle sahi dhang se kaam kar rahi thi or ab apekshanusaar kaary karnaa band kar de, tab aise pratigaman ghatit hote hai
 Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program change when the newly developed part of the software collides with already existing code
 regration pareekshan ke aam tareekon main shaamil he, pehle chalaae gaye pareekshan ko phir se chalaanaa or jaanch karnaa ki pehle thik kii gai kharabiyaan kahin phir se ubhar to nahin ai hai
 The depth of the test depends on the stage in the release process and the risk of additional features
 They can be either complete, for changes added too late in the release or risky, too shallow, made up of positive testing at each feature if the changes are happening early in release or are considered low risk Let's go
 exeptence pareekshan kaa taatpary do main se ek se ho saktaa he: Alpha testing is mock or real operational testing by potential users / customers or an independent test team on the developer's site
 software ke beta pareekshan main jane se pehle, alpha pareekshan ko aksar of-da-shelf software ke liye aantarik sweekruti pareekshan ke ek rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Beta testing comes after alpha testing
 beta sanskaran ke naam se vikhyath software kaa sanskaran, programing team se baahar ek simit graahakon ke liye jari kiya gaya
 The software is released to groups of people, so that further testing can be done to ensure that the product has minimal faults or bugs
 kabhi-kabhi, beta sanskaran ko bhavi upyogkartaaon kii adhiktam sankhya ko pratikriya ke kshetra ko badhaane ke liye, khuli janata ke liye uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he
 Special methods exist for testing non-functional aspects of software
 kaaryaatmak pareekshan ke vipareet, jo software ke sahi sanchaalan ko sthapit karata he, gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan is baat kii pushti karata he ki software tab bhi thik dhang se kaary karata he, jab ise avaidh yaa apratyaashit input praapt hoti he
 Software fault injection, in the form of fuzzing, is an example of a non-functional test
 gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan, vishesh rup se software kii khatir, yah sthapit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he ki pareekshan ke antargat rachana, avaidh yaa anpekshit input ko sahan kar sakati he yaa nahin or is prakaar ve input vailidation routine or saath hi saath erar-handlling routine kii majbootee ko sthapit kar sakenge
 Various commercial non-functional testing tools are linked to the software fault injection page; Many open source and free software tools are available, which perform non-functional testing
 parformens pareekshan, yaa lod pareekshan yah dekhne ke liye jaanch karata he ki software, badi maatra main data yaa upyogkartaaon ko sambhaal saktaa he yaa nahin
 This is generally known as software scalability
 gair-kaaryaatmak software pareekshan kii yah gatividhi aksar kshamta pariksha ke rup main jaani jaati he
 Stability testing checks to see if the software can function consistently well over or above an acceptable period
 gair-kaaryaatmak software pareekshan kii yah gatividhi aksar lod pareekshan ke rup main nirdisht hoti he
 Usability testing is needed to test whether the user interface is easy to use and understand
 suraksha pareekshan us software ke liye jaruri he jo havers dwaara system ghuspaith ko rokane ke liye gopneey data ko parishkrut karata he
 Internationalization and localization are needed to examine these aspects of software, for which a pseudostabilization method can be used
 yah is baat kii pushti karegaa ki anuprayog, ek nai bhashaa main anuwaad kiye jane yaa ek nai samskruti ke liye anukulit kiye jane ke baad bhi kaam karata he
 Destructive testing attempts to thwart software or subsystems to test its robustness
 software pareekshan ke ek aam tareeke ko, ise graahak ko bheje jane se pehle or isaki kaaryakshmata viksit kiye jane ke baad, pareekshakon ke ek swatantra samooh dwaara sampadit kiya jaataa he
 This practice often results in the testing phase being used as a project buffer to compensate for project delays and thus compromise the time devoted to testing
 ek or paripati he pariyojna ke shuru hone ke kshan hi software pareekshan ko shuru kar dena or pariyojna ke samaapan tak yah ek satat prakriya he
 In response, some emerging software disciplines such as Extreme Programming and Agile Software Development Movement follow a "test drive software development" model
 is prakriya main, software ejeeniyar dwaara unit test pehle likhe jate hai, 
 beshak ye pareekshan shuru main vifal ho jate hai; jaise ki unase ummid rahati he
 And then as the code is written it passes incrementally to a larger fraction of the test suite
 test sweet ko, vifaltaa kii nai paristhitiyon or corner cese ke milte rahane ke kaaran, lagaataar navinikrut kiya jaataa he or unhen kisi bhi viksit regration test ke saath ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Unit tests along with the rest of the software source code are maintained and typically integrated into the build process
 haalanki sanghathanon ke bich bhinnata maujuud he, pareekshan ke liye ek vishisht chakra hota he
 The following sample is common among organizations adopting the water fall development model
 kai programing samooh, swachaalit pareekshan par adhikadhik nirbhar kar rahe hai, vishesh rup se aise samooh jotest chaalit vikaas kaa upyog karte hai
 There are several frameworks for writing tests, and continuous integration software will run the test automatically each time the code is tested in a version control system

 In order to keep small amounts of foods cold for domestic use, refrigerators started to be manufactured commercially from 1917 AD and by 1925 AD they became accessible to the general public
 aarambh main to gaschalit yantra hi banaae gaye, lekin ab kuch varsho se vidyutshakti chaalit prashithitr sarvapriya ho gayi hai
 Nowadays, it takes almost the same to see the shelves of all types of refrigerators

 The function of keeping food in a refrigerant is by changing the physical condition of a refrigerant medium

 When the refrigerant-liquid filled in the evaporator inside them forms a gas, the heat of the food is absorbed and condensed into a condensate coil, which is always in contact with the air, and becomes liquid again
 inamen ek tapasthapi naame upkaran bhi laga rahata he, jiske dwaara khadyakaksh ke taap par niyantran rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In refrigeration devices operating on the principle of compression, or a motor of horsepower is employed to initiate the device's mechanism, by which condensation from a gaseous refrigerant-medium vaporizer such as sulfur dioxide or dichlorhydrofluor methane is induced into the coil

 These valves are also of two types
 ek to prasarak kapaat, jiske dwaara sanghanit prasheetak ek baarik phuhaare ke rup main bikharakar vaashpitra main pravisht hota he or jisase uskaa ekadam hi, aanshik rup main, vaashp ban jaataa he
 The second type is the plasma valve, which performs its work when a large amount of refrigerant-fluid is collected inside the evaporator and only then the action cycle is repeated
 avasorana ke siddhant par chalanevaale prashithitron main ammonia gas thande pani main saralata se ghul jaati he or pani ke garam hone par saralata se nikal bhi jaati he
 Therefore, a flame of oil or gas is used to heat water

 Then, as soon as the mixture of hydrogen and ammonia gas from the evaporator reaches the absorber cell, a fine spray of water is found in it
 isse ammonia gas to pani main ghul jaati he tathaa pani main aviley hydrogen vaashpitra main waapas laut jaataa he
 Here, the ammonium hydroxide enters the evaporator and restores the action cycle

 The marking of the extension below or parallel to the vision is easy, but it is a difficult subject to mark the far extension in front of the eyes
 is prakaar kii duuri kaa vistaar pradarshit karne kii kriya ko 'persepective' kehete hai
 The views of a city on a far-off road, a river in front, etc
, cannot be shown without knowing its principles
 kis prakaar nikat ke padaarth bade or saaf dikhaai padate hai or dur ke padaarth kramshah chote or dhundle hote jate hai, ye sab baaten ankit kerani padati hai
 Take, for example, a frame frame placed at a distance
 maan lijie ki aap use ek aise kinare se dekh rahe hai jahaan se uske do parshv yaa teen kone dikhaai padate hai
 Now for the purpose of drawing a picture, we will see with a pencil parallel to the eyes and pressing one eye, the vertical angle closest to all of the box will be seen; The side which will be more in front, the angle on the other side will be smaller than that and the side which will be less visible, the angle on the other side of it will appear the smallest
 arthath nearesth kone rekha se laga hua us parshv kaa kone jo kam dikhaai detaa he, adhik dikhaai padanevaale parshv ke kone se chota hoga
 The second principle is of light and shadow, without which life cannot come
 padaarth kaa jo ansh nikat or saamne rahegaa vah khulata or spasht hoga; or jo dur yaa bagal main padegaa, vah spasht ore kalimaa liye hoga
 The elevation and depth of the substances are also shown according to the rules of this light and shade
 jo ansh uthaa yaa ubhara hoga, vah adhik khulata hoga or jo dhansa yaa gaharaa hoga vah kuch syaahi liye hoga
 Because of not knowing these principles, the market painters who make paintings on glass, etc
, seem to know the game
 chitron main rang ek prakaar kii kunchi se bharaa jaataa he jise chitrakaar kalam kehete hai
 Earlier there was a pen made of hair of a squirrel's tail
 ab vilayati brush kaam main aate hai

 Bhubaneswar railway station is the railway station of Bhubaneswar city
 prakrutwad paashchaatya darshanik chintan kii vah vichaardhaara he jo prakruti ko mul tatva maanati he, isi ko is baramand kaa karta evam upadan maanati he
 It is that 'idea' or 'belief' that only natural laws work in the world and not any supernatural or metaphysical rules
 arthath prakrithik sansar ke pare kuch bhi nahin he
 Naturalists do not believe in the power of soul-god, clear purpose etc
 unani darshanik thels kaa naam sabase pehle prakrutivaadiyon main aata he jisane is sristi kii rachana jal se siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 But in the form of free philosophy, it was planted by Democritus
 prakrutivaadee vichaarak buddhi ko vishesh mahatv dete hai parantu unka vichaar he ki buddhi kaa kaary keval vahya paristhitiyon tathaa vichaaron ko kaabo main laana he jo uski shakti se baahar janm lete hai
 Thus naturalists do not believe in the power of soul-god, clear purpose etc
 pro
 sorle kaa vichaar he ki prakrutwad vah vichaardhaara he jiske anusaar swaabhaavik athwa nirmaan kii shakti manushya ke sharir ko nahin di ja sakati
 Naturalism appeared in front of the society as a reaction to the complexity of civilization
 ‘prakruti’ ke arth ke sambandh main darshanikon main matbhed rahaa he
 According to Adams, this word is very complex, due to its ambiguity, there are many mistakes
 ‘prakruti’ ko teen prakaar se spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 In the first sense, nature refers to that special quality that helps in leading human life towards development and progress
 sarvapratham ruso ne hi prakruti ke is arth se avgat karaayaa
 On the basis of which Dr
 Hall developed the form of 'child centered education'
 atah pratham arth main prakruti kaa taatpary maanav swabhaav se liya jaataa he
 The second meaning of 'prakriti' was stated to be 'exactly opposite of design'
 arthath jis kaary main manushya ne sahyog na diya ho vahi prakritik he
 According to the third meaning of 'nature', 'the whole world' is nature and according to education it means studying the action of the world and bringing it into life
 kuch vidwaan aisa maanate hai ki manushya ko prakruti kii vikasvaadi shrunkhlaa main baadhak nahin bananaa chahie
 But it should remain separate
 chunki vikaas kisi vyakti ke bina nahin ho saktaa he, vyakti bina prayojan kaary nahin kar saktaa, isliye kuch vidwaan aisa maanate hai ki is vikaas ke niyam kaa adhyayan karnaa chaiye tathaa prakruti kaa anuyaayi ho janaa chaiye
 It is thus clear that there is no consensus regarding the meaning of 'nature'
 pracheen siddhanth ke anusaar vah maarg jisamen vyakti jivan main adhik mulyon kii prapti kar saktaa he, vah he- apane jivan kaa prakruti ke saath yatha sambhav nikat sambandh sthapit karnaa
 These ideas are in line with the ideas of Democrites, Epicurus and Lucretius
 ye sabhi vidwaan saamanytah aise jivan kii prapti kii kaamana rakhte the jo yatha sambhav ksht evam pidaa se mukt ho
 Most naturalists, considering the highest credit, have considered it superior and eternal happiness
 is aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki prakrutwad kaa nitishastra sukhwadi he
 Philosophers have differed regarding the meaning of 'nature'
 adams kaa kahana he ki yah shabd atyant jatil he jisaki aspashtataa ke kaaran anek bhoolen hoti hai
 Nature can be explained in 3 ways- yah vichaardhaara padaarth vigyaan par aadhaarit he
 According to this, the molecule exists in all nature
 jagat kii rachana inhen anutatvon se hui he
 Life and mind are all formed by the combination of physical elements
 padaarth vigyaan keval bahya prakruti ke niyamon kaa adhyayan karata he or inhen niyamon ke aadhaar par anubhav ke prayek tathyon kii vyakhya karata he
 Hence laws of nature are paramount
 yah manushya ko bhi padaarth vigyaan ke niyamon ke anusaar samajhane kaa prayaas karata he
 It has no purpose with the inner nature of man, but education is a human process which is related to the inner nature of human
 atah shiksha ke kshetra main padaarth vigyaan ke prakrutwad kaa koi vishesh yogadan nahin he
 According to this community, the universe is a machine that is created by matter and speed
 is pranhin yantra main koi dhyey, prayojan yaa aadhyatmik shakti nahin he
 Although a human being is the best creature in this world, it does not have self-consciousness, its behavior is controlled due to external effects
 jyon-jyon maanav vahya vaataavaran ke sampark main aata he, maanav yantra sucharu rup se kriya karata rahata he
 In this ideology, it is not possible to explain the purposefulness, functionality of human beings, its spiritual qualities
 pashu kii sthiti, yantra kii sthiti tathaa manushya kii sthiti teenon main antar he
 Therefore, human education should be done differently
 isliye shiksha ke kshetra main yantravaadi prakrutwad kaa koi vishesh yogadan nahin he
 This ideology believes in 'principles of development'
 isliye is vichaardhaara kaa udgam darwin ke kramavikas siddhanth se hua he
 According to this belief, man is in the last stage in the evolution of organisms
