 It was decided to divide Bengal of India into two parts for the purpose of creating a Muslim majority province
 vibhaajan 16 oktober 1905 se prabhavi hua
 In history it is also known as Bangabhang
 yah angrejon kii "foot daalo - raaj karo" vaali niti kaa hi ek ang tha
 Therefore, in 1908 AD, the 'bang-bhang' movement started in protest against it

 The area of bengal province was 489,500 square kilometers and the population was more than 8 crore
 purvi bengal bhugolic rup se evam kam sanchaar sadhano ke kaaran pashchimi bengal se lagbhag alag-thalag tha
 In 1836, the Upper Provinces were brought under the rule of a Lieutenant Governor and in 1854 the Governor general-in-council was relieved of the direct administration of Bengal
 alag chif-kamishnarship banane ke liye 1874 main assam ko silahat sahit, bengal se alag kar diya gaya or baad main 1898 main lushai hills ko bhi isamen shaamil kar diya gaya
 It was very difficult to manage a large and so populous province like Bengal
 sarvapratham 1903 main bengal ke vibhaajan ke bare main sochaa gaya
 Additional proposals were also made to merge the districts of Chittagang and Dhaka and Mamansingh with Bengal and Assam
 isi prakaar chota nagpur ko bhi kendriya praant se milaayaa janaa tha
 The 19th session of the Congress was also held in Madras in 1903

 He consulted with prominent personalities and made speeches in Dhaka, Chittagong and Mamansingh to try to explain the government's stand on partition
 henry jon stedman coton, jo ki 1896 se 1902 ke bich assam ke mukhya ayukta the, ne is vichaar kaa virodh kiya
 Speaking from the post of Chairman in the next session of Congress, Sir Henry Cotton also said that if there is an excuse that such a large province cannot be handled by a governor, then either the governing council of Bengal, like Bombay and Madras, will be in the vicinity of the Governor or Bengali
 Speakers should be separated and made a province

 But the British government neither cared for Congress nor did it hold public opinion

 praant ke bantwaare se poorviy kshetra main behatar prashasan sthapit kiya ja saktaa tha jisase antat vahaan kii janata skool or rojgaar ke maukon se labhanvit hoti
 However, other motives were also hidden behind the plan of partition

 On 20 July 1905 Vangabhang's proposal was struck down by the Secretary of India, despite strong public opposition
 rajshahi, dhaka tathaa chatagaanv kamishnariyon ko assam ke saath milakar ek praant banaaya gaya, jiskaa naam purvavang or assam rakhaa gaya or baaki hissaa yani presidensi or vardhaman kamishnariyaan bihar, ud or iskaa koi aadhaar tha
 On this occasion, Hindus and Muslims were tried to fight, saying that this division would benefit the Muslims as they would have a majority in the East and Assam
 dhaka ke nawab ne pehle virodh kiya tha, par jab vangbhang ho gaya to vah uske paksh main ho gaye
 Sir Joseph Bamfield Fuller became the former and the new Lieutenant Governor of Assam
 kaha jaataa he, unhone kai jagah khullamakhulla kaha ki hindu or musalmaan unki do bibiyaan hai, inamen se musalmaan unki chaheti hai
 The meaning of this statement was clear

 If seen in depth, it was the seed planting of Pakistan from here
 muslim lig ke 1906 ke adhiveshan main jo prastaav paas hue, unamem se ek yah bhi tha ki vangbhang musalamaanon ke liye acha he or jo log iske viruddh andolan karte hai, ve galat kaam karte hai or ve musalamaanon ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Later, in the 1908 session of the League, it was also passed that the proposal of the Congress to oppose Vangabhang was not worthy of acceptance

 The demand for the creation of two independent states for Hindus and Muslims at the national level began to arise, with most Bengali Hindus now favoring the partition of Bengal on the basis of Hindu majority area and Muslim majority area

 The protest by the Indian National Congress was led by Sir Henry John Stedman Cotton, formerly the Chief Commissioner of Assam, but Curzon remained unmoved

 In 1906 Rabindranath Tagore composed Amar Shonar Bangla, the rally slogan of those who opposed partition, became the national anthem of Bangladesh in 1972
 in raajnneetik virodhon ke kaaran, bengal ke donon bhaag 1911 main phir se jud gaye the

 According to materialism, the subject of knowledge exists independent of the knower and there is no difference in its status from being or not
 drushtiwad ek rup main, prrikti ke swatantra astitv se inkaar karata he; duusare rup main, kahata he ki gyaat hone se hi iskaa rang rup badal jaataa he or hamaare liye sambhav nahin ki bahari satta ko uske vaastavik rup main dekh saken
 In Western philosophy, both George Berkeley and Kant support this notion

 kiratarjunium mahakavi bharavi dwaara saatvin shatee i
 main rachit mahakavy he jise sanskrit sahitya main mahakavyon kii 'vrihattrayee' main sthaan praapt he
 Based on the short story of Arjuna's war with Kiratveshi Shiva described in the Mahabharata, the poet has given a captivating description of politics, religion, diplomacy, socialism, war, politics and life
 yah kavy vibhinn rason se otprot he kintu yah mukhyatah vir ras pradhan rachana he
 There are six famous epics of Sanskrit - Brihattrayi and Minatrayi
 kiratarjanuyium, shishupalavdham or naishadhicharitam – brihattrayee kehalaate hai
 Kumarasambhavam, Raghuvansham and Meghdootam - are called miniatures
 kiratarjunium bharavi kii ekmaatr uplabdh kriti he, jisane ek sangopang mahakavy kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Magha-like poets, following the same, enriched the Sanskrit literature store with this genre and gave it a new height

 There have been at least 37 commentaries of Kiratarajuniyam in Sanskrit, of which the Mallinath commentary is the best
 san 1912 main karl cappalar ne harvard oriyental siries ke antargat kiratarjunium kaa german anuwaad kiya

 raajnneeti or vyavhaar-niti main bharavi ke vishesh rujhaan ke chalate yah yuktiyukt hi tha ki ve kiratarjunium kaa kathanak mahabharat se uthaate
 He raised the small theme of acquiring Pashupatastra as a result of Shiva's abject penance by Arjuna for the unfolding of the Pandavas during the exile of the Pandavas from the five chapters of Vanaparva and gave it the form of this epic of eighteen cantos
 jab yudhisthir kauravon ke saath sampann dyutakrida main sab kuch haar gayi to unhen apane bhaaiyon evam draupadi ke saath 13 varsh ke vanvaas par janaa padaa
 Most of his time was spent in dualism
 vanvaas ke kashton se khinn hokar or kauravon dwaara kii gayi sajeesh ko yaad karke draupadi yudhisthir ko aksar prerit karti thim ki ve yuddh kii taiyaari karen or yuddh ke madhyam se kauravon se apana rajpth waapas len
 Bhima also favors Draupadi's talk
 guptchar ke rup main hastinapur bheje gaye ek vanechar se soochna milti he ki duryodhana apane sammilit rajya ke sarvangin vikaas or sudrudhikaran main dattachitt he, kyonki kapat-dyut se hastgat kiye gaye aadhe rajya ke liye use pandavon se ashanka he
 The Pandavas also feel that at the end of the period of exile, half of their kingdom will not be returned without war
 draupadi or bhim yudhisthir ko vanvaas kii avadhi samaapt hone kii pratiksha na kar duryodhana par turant akraman ke liye uksaate hai, lekin adarshavaadi, kshamashil yudhisthir vyavhaar kii maryaada laanghane ko taiyaar nahin
 Vyas, who has come there, advises that the Pandavas should advance their power for future war
 unheen ke dwaara bataae gaye upaay ke anusaar arjuna shastrastra ke liye indra ko tap se prasann karne ke liye ek yaksha ke maargdarshan main himalay-sthit indrakil parvat kii ore chal padate hai
 Indra is present in the guise of an old sage after taking the test by sending apsaras etc
 as a result of austerities done by building an ashram there and illustrating the importance of charitableness, stating the perishable cosmic goal of austerity
 arjuna isaki kaat main kauravon dwaara kiye gaye chal evam anyaay kaa lekha-jokha prastutkar shatru se pratishodh lene kii anivaaryta, saamaajik kartavya-paalan tathaa anyaay ke pratikaar kaa tark dekar indra ko santusht kar dete hai
 As a result, Indra, appearing in his real form, advises Arjuna to do penance for Shiva for mano-fulfillment
 arjuna phir se ghor, niraahaar tapasya main leen ho jate hai
 Arjuna is a stranger to Indrakil, ascetic, jata, Valkal and mrigacharm, but he also has armor in the body, in place of Yajnopavit, there is a Gandhiv bow with a pratchancha, two huge tarakas and a perfect pillar
 use munidharm-virdohi samajhakar vahaan ke anya tapasvi aatankit hai or shankar ke paas nivedan ke liye pahunch jate hai
 In his order, Shiva, disguised as the commander of the local tribal tribe, arrives to Arjuna with the army of his ganas
 tabhi 'mook' naam kaa ek daanav arjuna kii tapasya ko devataaon kaa kaary samajhakar, vishaal shookar kaa sharir dharankar, usko maarane ke liye jhapatata he
 a similar arrow fired simultaneously by both Shiva and Arjuna ends that pig's illusion
 shiv kaa baan to uske sharir ko bedhta hua dharti main dhans jaataa he or arjuna jab apana baan uske sharir se nikaalane jate hai to shiv apane ek gana ko bhejkar vivaad khadaa kara dete hai
 As a result, a war between the two begins
 arjuna ganon kii sena ko to baan-varsha se bhaagane ko majaboor kar dete hai par shiv ke saath hue yuddh main parrast ho jate hai
 Desperate from defeat, Arjuna recognizes Shiva and surrenders, disguised as Kirat-senapati, leading Shiva to appear happy and impart Pashupatastra to him
 is tarah arjuna kaa mantavya puraa hone ke saath mahakavy-vidha ke bhi saare mantavya siddh ho jate hai
 Apart from this extraterrestrial myth of the Kiratha prostitute Shiva, this episode also has its own specific tribal expression, which brings this poetry closer to the current sentiment
 yudhisthir or guptchar bane vanechar ke bich ghatit samvaad main vanechar kii jo atoot swamibhakti, adamya nirbhikta or ucch raajnneetik samaj saamne aati he, vah vanavaasiyon ke prati bharavi kii pakshabharata main andeh kii koi gunjaaish nahin chhodti
 Vancher makes it clear in the beginning- is puure prakaran ke armbh main draupadi kii baton ke samarthan main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ke prati kuchek nitiwachan kahe gayi hai
 One of them is cited below: bharavi apane arth-gaurav ke liye jane jate hai—‘upama kalidassy bharverrthgauravam’
 His wealth is an ingenious language and expressive skills matching this sense of pride
 raajnneeti or vyavhaar-niti sahit jivan ke vividh ayaamon main unki asaadhaaran paith he
 The balance earned by the duality of ideals and attitudes and the excesses of excesses of real life makes his writing 'all-rounder'
 lekin bharavi mulat: jivan kii vidambnaaon or visangatiyon ke kavi hai, unka saamana karte hai or unke khurdure yatharth ke bich sangati bithaane kaa prayaas karte hai
 In the first canto of Kiratarajuniyam, in order for Draupadi and Bhima in the second to provoke Yudhishthira to declare war against Duryodhana, and Yudhishthira rejecting him as unjust, Bharvi provided a very meaningful discussion on the duality between the two ends of politics
 is
 isi tarah gyarahawein sarg main moksh ke sthaan par shakti or prabhutaa ke liye kiye ja rahe arjuna ke tap ko indra dwaara garhit bataae jane par, arjuna ke pratyuttar ke rup main bharavi ne jivan-vyavhaar main anyaay ke pratikaar, loukik safalataa, yash or aatm-sammaan ke mahatv par jo gambheer vichaar die hai ve swasth ihlokik jivan kaa ek santulit adarsh kaa chitra upasthit karte hai
 The linguistic miracle of chitrakavya, which Bhartvi started, owing to his unwavering authority over the language, became the criterion for his later poets and reached the climax in Magh
 nimnlikhit panktiyon main chitralankar dekhie- Similarly, watch the following verses carefully

 The same verse has appeared four times but the meanings are different
 kiratarjunium main 18 sarg hai
 In the first canto of Kiratarajuniyam, in order for Draupadi and Bhima in the second to provoke Yudhishthira to declare war against Duryodhana, and Yudhishthira rejecting him as unjust, Bharvi provided a very meaningful discussion on the duality between the two ends of politics
 is
 tisare sarg main vyas kaurav paksh ke bhishma, dron, karn-jaise dhurandharon ko pandavon dwaara ajey bataate hue 13 saal kii avadhi main har tarah se shakti-sanvardhan karne or bhavishya ke avashyambhavi yuddh kii taiyaari ke liye uskaa upyog karne kii salaah dete hai
 For this they inspire Arjuna to please Indra with austerity for high-quality weapons and also leave a Yaksha brought with him which will take Arjuna to a place suitable for Indra's penance
 chauthe sarg main yaksha ke maargdarshan main arjuna kii dwaitvan se himalay tak kii yatra kaa sajiv evam rochak varnan he, jisamen sharad ritu kii thir or sanyat prakruti or uske saath ghule-mili jan-jivan kaa ullas naanaa roopon main tarangit he
 From the journey of Arjuna with the fifth canto Yaksha, Giriraj is enlightened by the vivid, ornamental description of the mountainous region of the Himalayas
 chathe sarg kaa varnya vishay he : arjuna kii aankhon se dekhi indranil kii apratim shobhaa, vahaan pahunchakar arjuna dwaara tap kaa prarambh, prakruti ke vibhinn upaadaanon kaa tap main sahyog, vahaan tainaat vanadevon dwaara amravati pahahunchakar indra ko suchit karnaa, indra dwaara devanganaon ko unke sahchar gandharvon ke saath vahaan jaakar apane haav-bhav or soundarya se arjuna kii tapasya main vighn daalane kaa aadesh dena, taaki unki nishtha kii pariksha ho sake
 In the seventh canto, the Apsaras and their companions Gandharva travel from Amaravati to Indrakil along the banks of the Ganges with special elephants and chariots riding the sky
 indrakil ke paas neeche utarkar ve prithvi-ganga ke ramya tat par apni maaya se gandharva-nagari jaisaa divya shivi bana lete hai
 In the eighth canto, the apsaras leave their camps for forest-hunting
 yahan se shringaar ras kaa rang chadhana shuru hota he, jo isi sarg main varnit jal-krida main gadha hota he or nawein sarg main madh-paan ke saath sampann kaam-keli main apni paraakaashtha par pahunch jaataa he
 The tenth canto is the campaign and failure of Apsaras to grab Arjuna's attention and meditate on him
 gyarahawein sarg main vayovruddh muni ke vesh main indra ke aagaman or unke dwaara tapasya ke sansaarik lakshya kii nissartaa kaa nidarshan he jiske pratyuttar main arjuna loukik jivan ke mulyon, praathamiktaaon kaa apana aakhyaan rachate hai
 At the end of this canto, satisfied with Arjuna's reasoning, Devaraja appears in his form and teaches the worship of Shiva according to his goal
 barahawein sarg main arjuna ghor tapasya armbh kar dete hai jisase ghabaraakar anya sanyasi shankar ke paas ja pahunchate hai
 Shankar meets Arjun disguised as Kirat
 terahaven sarg main arjuna or kiraat rupadhari shiv donon sookar rupadhari par tir se akraman karte hai
 The last five cantos of Kiratarajuniyam are dedicated to the war between Kirataveedhari Shiva and Arjuna with their Ganesha

 Gulab Rai Ji's philosophical works are the result of his serious study and contemplation
 unhone sarv pratham hindi ko apane darshanik vichaaron kaa daan diya
 Before them, there was a complete lack of this subject in Hindi
 gulabry ji kii saahitiyik rachanaaon ke antargat unke aalochanatmak niabandh aate hai
 These critical essays are both theoretical and practical
 gulabry ji ne saamaajik, saanskrithik, manovaigyanik aadi vividh vishyon par bhi apni lekhnee chalaakar hindi sahitya kii abhivruddhi kii he
 Gulabrai ji's language is a pure and sophisticated standing dialect
 uske mukhyatah do rup dekhne ko milte hai - clisht tathaa saral
 The language of reflective essays is clean and sophisticated
 usamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii pradhanta he, bhavatmak nibandhon kii bhashaa saral he
 It has the predominance of the prevalent Hindi words, as well as the use of Urdu and English words
 kahawaton or muhaavaron ko bhi apanaaya gaya he
 Gulabrai ji's language is pageant zero
 sanskrit ke prakand pandit hote hue bhi gulabry ji ne apni bhashaa main kahin bhi paanditya-pradarshan kaa praytn nahin kiya
 In short, Gulab Rai Ji's language is moderate, serious and fluent
 gulab raay ji kii rachanaaon main hamen nimnlikhit shaileyon ke darshan hote hai- 1
 Critical style - This style is found in Gulab Rai Ji's critical and reflective essays
 is style main saahitiyik tathaa darshanik vishyon par gambhirtha se vichaar karte samay vaakya apekshaakrit lambey or duruh ho jate hai, kintu jahaan vartmaan samasyaayen, pracheen siddhanton kii vyakhyaayein athwa kaviyon kii vyaakhyaatmak aalochanaayen prastut kii gai hai, vahaan vaakya saral or bhavpurn hai
 An example of this style - celebrating 'rashtriya Parva' is not a sentimental sentiment
 is bhavukta kaa mulya he
 Sentimentality involves infectiousness and then infuses power
 vichaar hamaari dasha kaa nidarshan kar sakate hai kintu kaary sampadan kii prabal prerana or shakti bhaavon main hi nihit rahati he
 2
 Emotional style - This style of Gulab Rai ji has a beautiful fusion of thoughts and feelings
 yah style prabhaavshaaleen he or isamen gadhy kavy kaa sa anand aata he
 Its language is very simple
 vaakya chote-chote hai or kahin-kahin urdu ke prachlit shabdon kaa bhi prayog hua he
 An example of this style from an essay titled ‘nar to Narayana’ - ‘there was an outbreak of water in Agra in the month of September
 maine bhi vaisya dharm ke paalane ke liye paas ke ek khet main chari 'bo' rakhi thi
 The leaves of jowar were twisted into lumps

 hasya or vinodpurn style - gulab raay ji ne apane nibandhon kii neerasata ko dur karne ke liye gambhir vishyon ke varnan main hasya or vyangy kaa put bhi diya he
 In this subject, he has written- 'now i have started incorporating humor in serious subjects too
 jahaan hasya ke kaaran arth kaa anarth hone kii sambhaavna ho athwa atyant karun prasang ho to hasya se bachuungaa anyathaa main prasang gat hasya kaa utana hi swaagat karata hoon jitna ki kripan yaa koi bhi anayas aae hue dhan kaa
 In order to incorporate humor in this style, Gubab Rai ji either resorts to idioms or puns
 is style ke vaakya kuch bade hai
 Urdu, Persian words and idioms have also been used in it
 gulabry ji ne moulik granthon kii rachana ke saath-saath anek granthon kaa sampadan bhi kiya he
 His works are as follows: aalochanatmak rachanaayen- navras, hindi sahitya kaa subodh itihaas hindi, natya vimarsh, aalochana kusumanjali, kavy ke rup, siddhant or adhyayan aadi
 Philosophical - Duty scripture, logic, Buddhism, history of Western philosophies, outline of Indian culture

 unhone aalochana or niabandh donon hi kshetron main apni pratibha or moulikta kaa parichay diya he
 He was the first person in Hindi to compose philosophical essays
 gulab raay ji ke nibandhon main naitikta kaa sandesh, samaaj ke liye pragati, sheel drushtikon, darshan ke jatil siddhaton kii saralatam vyakhya or raashtra prem kii udaatt bhaavana he
 As an original essayist, outstanding critic and successful editor, Gulab Rai ji always deserves praise and thanks for the service he has rendered in Hindi

 Madhavrao Sadashivrao Golwalkar anecdote Shri Guruji was the second Sarsanghchalak and great thinker of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 unhen jansadharan praaia: 'guruuji' ke hi naam se adhik jaanate hai
 He was born on Ekadashi Samvat 1963 of Falgun month accordingly on 19 February 1906 in Ramtek, Maharashtra
 ve apane mata-pita kii chauthi santan the
 His father's name was Shri Sadashiv Rao Aakhyakya 'bhau Ji' and his mother's Mrs Laxmibai Aakhyak 'tai'
 unka bachapan main naam madhav rakhaa gaya par parivaar main ve madhu ke naam se hi pukaare jate the
 Father Sadashiv Rao was initially working in the post and telegraph department, but later in 1908 he was appointed to the post of teacher in the education department
 madhu jab maatr do varsh ke the tabhi se unki shiksha prarambh ho gayi thi
 Whatever Father Pithary Bhauji taught him, he instinctively memorized it
 balak madhu main kushagra budhdi, gyaan kii laalasaa, asaamaanya samaran shakti jaise gunon kaa samucchy bachapan se hi viksit ho rahaa tha
 In 1919, he received a scholarship by showing special merit in the 'high School Entrance Examination'
 san 1922 main 16 varsh kii aayu main madhav ne metric kii pariksha chaanda ke 'jubilee hai skool' se uteern kii
 Thereafter, in 1924, he passed the intermediate examination in science subject with special qualification from 'hislap College' run by Christian Missionaries of Nagpur
 angreji vishay main unhen pratham paritoshik mila
 He used to play a lot of hockey, sometimes even played tennis
 iske atirikt vyaayaam kaa bhi unhen shauk tha
 He was very proficient in the tricks, grip and jump etc
 of Malkhamb
 vidhyaarthee jivan main hi unhone baansuri evam sitar vaadan main bhi acchhee praveenta hasil kar lee thi
 After passing the intermediate examination, a new far-reaching chapter in Madhavrao's life began in 1924 with admission to the Banaras Hindu University
 san 1926 main unhone bi

 In this way his student life was very famous
 vishvavidhyalay main bitaaye chaar varshon ke kalkhand main unhone vishay ke adhyayan ke alaava "sanskrit mahakavyon, paashchaatya darshan, shri ramakrishna paramhans, swami vivekananda kii ospurn evam prerak 'vichaar smapda', bhinn-bhinn upasna-panthon ke pramukh granthon tathaa shastreey vishyon ke anek granthon kaa asthaapurvak pathan kiya"
 Meanwhile, his interest in spiritual life was awakened
 em

 kii pariksha uteern karne ke pashchaat ve praani-shaastra vishay main 'matsay jivan' par shodh kaary hetu madras ke matsyalay se jud gayi
 Within a year his father Shri Bhauji retired, due to which he was unable to send money to Shri Guruji

 The doctor was of the opinion that if caution is not taken, the disease can take serious form

 During his stay in Madras, when he was working in research, once the Nizam of Hyderabad came to see the mermaid
 niyamanusaar pravesh-shulk diye bina use pravesh dene se shri guruuji ne inkaar kar diya
 Due to financial constraints Mr
 Guruji had to leave his research work incomplete and return to Nagpur in April 1929
 uname adbhut kshamta thi logo ko apni ore aakarshith karne kii
 Even after coming to Nagpur, he was not well
 iske saath hi unke parivaar kii aarthik sthiti bhi atyant kharaab ho gayi thi
 Meanwhile, he received a proposal from Banaras Hindu University to serve in the post of illustrator
 16 agast san 1931 ko shri guruuji ne banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke praani-shaastra vibhaag main nidarshak kaa pad sambhaal liya
 As it was a temporary appointment
 is kaaran ve praaia: chintit bhi rahaa karte the
 Even in his student life, Madhav Rao used to guide his friends in their studies and now teaching had become a means of livelihood
 unke adhyaapan kaa vishay yadhyapi praani-vigyaan tha, vishvavidhyalay prashasan ne unki pratibha pahchaan kar unhen bi
e
 kii kaksha ke chaatro ko angreji or raajnneeti shaastra bhi padhaane kaa avasar diya
 As a teacher, Madhav Rao became so popular among the students with his unique talent and ability that his students started addressing him in the name of Guruji
 isi naam se ve aage chalakar jivan bhar jane gayi
 Although Madhav Rao was a Masters of Science, he was always ready to teach other subjects like English, Economics, Mathematics and Philosophy to his students and friends when needed
 yadi unhen pustkaalay main pustaken nahin milti thim, to ve unhen kharid kar or padhakar jigyaasi chaatro evam mitron kii sahaayta karte rahete the
 Much of his salary was spent on paying the fees of his promising student-friends or buying his books
 sabase pehle ""dow headgavar"" ke dwaara kaashi vishvavidhyalay bheje gaye nagpur ke swayamsevak bhaiyaji daani ke dwaara shri guruuji sangh ke sampark main aaye or us shakha ke sanghachaalak bhi bane
 In 1937, he returned to Nagpur
 nagpur main shri guruuji ke jivan main ek dam nae mode kaa armbh ho gaya
 In the context of "dr
 Hedgewar", he saw an extremely inspiring nation devoted to him
 kisi aapt vyakti ke dwaara is vishay par poochne par unhone kaha-"meraa rujhaan raashtra sanghathan kaary kii or prarambh se he
 It is my belief that i will be able to do this work with more efficacy by staying in the Union
 isliye maine sangh kaary main hi swayan ko samarpit kar diya
 i feel that my behavior is absolutely consistent with Swami Vivekananda's philosophy and methodology
 "1938 ke pashchaat sangh kaary ko hi unhone apana jivan kaary maan liya
 Constantly with Dr
 Hedgewar, he concentrated all his attention on union work
 isse dow headgavar ji kaa dhyey purna hua
 In 1939, Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar was appointed as the Sarkaryavah of the Sangh due to total dedication and strong self-restraint towards "dr
 Hedgewar", the founder of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 1940 main ""headgavar"" kaa fever badhata hi gaya or apana ant samay jaanakar unhone upasthit kaaryakartaaon ke saamne madhav ko apane paas bulaayaa or kaha ""ab aap hi sangh kaa kaary sambhaalein""
 On 21 June 1940 Hedgewar merged into Anant
 9 agast 1942 ko bina shakti ke hi congress ne angrejon ke khilaaf ""bharat chodo"" andolan ched diya
 a big movement started all over the country, but due to unorganized direction, many types of sabotage started happening on behalf of the people
 sattadhariyon ne badi krurta se daman nitiyaan apanaai
 By 2-3 months, the spark of movement subsided
 desh ke sabhi netaa karagaar main the or unki rihaai kii koi aashaa dikhaai nahin de rahi thi
 Shri Guruji had decided that the Sangh would not directly participate in the movement, but the volunteers would be motivated individually
 16 agast 1946 ko mohammad ali jinnah ne sidhi kaarywahi kaa din ghoshit kar ke hindu hatya kaa tandav machaa diya
 In those days, Shri Guruji, in each of his speeches across the country, kept on calling on the people to stand up against the partition of the country, but the Congress leaders were not in a mood to fight for Akhand Bharat
 pandit nehru ne bhi spasht shabdon main vibhaajan ko sweekaar kar liya tha or 3 june 1947 ko isaki ghoshnaa kar di gai
 The situation of the country suddenly changed
 is kathin samay main swayamsevakon ne pakistan vaale bhaag se hinduon ko surakshit bharat bhejnaa shuru kiya
 The order of the Sangh was that till the last Hindu is safe, it has to stand
 bheeshan dinon main swayamsevakon kaa athulaneey parakram, rankushalta, tyaag or balidaan kii gaatha bharat ke itihaas main svarnim aksharon se likhane laayak he
 Shri Guruji also continued to migrate to Pakistan in this difficult watch
 30 janvari 1948 ko gandhi hatya ke aarope main 4 farvari ko sangh par pratibandh lagaaya gaya
 Mr
 Guruji was arrested
 desh bhar main swayamsevako kii giraftaaryaan hui
 While in jail, he sent a detailed statement of letters and magazines, in which the government was given a befitting reply
 aahvaan kiya gaya kii sangh par aarope siddh karo yaa pratibandh hataao
 This tone was echoed across the country
 26 farvari 1948 ko desh ke pradhanmantri pandit jawaharlal nehru ko grih mantri vallabh bhai patel ne apane patr main likhaa tha ""gandhi hatya ke kand main maine swayan apana dhyaan lagaakar puri jaankaree praapt kii he
 All the criminals associated with him have been caught
 unamem ek bhi vyakti rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa nahin he
 "" 9 disambar 1948 ko satyagrah naam ke is andolan kii shuruyaat hote hi kuch 4-5 hazaar bacchon kaa yah andolan he aisa maanakar netagan ne iskaa majaak udaaya
 But in contrast, no Congress movement had such a number
 77090 swayamsevakon ne vibhinn jelon ko bhar diya
 Eventually, the ban was lifted by ordering the Union to make a written constitution, and now Gandhi's murder was not even mentioned in it
 tab sardaar vallabhbhai patel ne guruuji ko bheje huve apane sandesh main likhaa kii ""sangh par se paabandi uthaane par mujhe jitani kushi hui iskaa pramaan to us samay jo log mere nikat the ve hi bataa sakate hai


 main aapako apni shubhakamanaayen bhejtaa hoon
 "" shri guruuji ne chini akraman shuru hote hi jo maarg darshan diya uske pariprekshya main swayamsevak yuddh prayatnon main janata kaa samarthan jutaney tathaa unka manobal drudh karne main jute gaye
 The importance of their timely cooperation also had to be acknowledged by Pandit Nehru and he even sent an invitation to the RSS volunteers to participate in the Republic Day movement in 1963, despite the objections of some Congressmen
 kahana na hoga kii sangh ke teen hazaar ganaveshadhari swayamsevakon kaa ghosh kii taal par kadam milakar chalanaa us din ke kaarykram kaa ek pramukh aakarshan tha

 The man-eaters of Savo is a book written by John Henry Patterson in 1907 that describes his experiences that he went through while building a railroad bridge and the bridge later being built in a country called Kenya
 ise ek sher ke jode kii kahani kaa varnan karne ke liye vyapak rup se janaa jaataa he jise unhone maaraa tha, is jode ko saavo ke aadamkhor kaha jaataa tha
 After the death of the lions, the book describes the completion of the bridge construction despite additional challenges, as well as many other stories related to local wildlife, local tribes, man cave hunts and various hunting expeditions

 The book has been thrice adapted: a monochrome, 1950s British film, a 1952 3-D film titled Bawana Devil, and a 1996 color version titled Ghost and Darkness in which Wall Kilmer played the brave engineer Nibaya who hunts Savo's lions

 It is noteworthy that those cannibals killed about 135 people within a year before Patterson was killed
 khud karnal patterson kii 1907 kii kitaab main likhaa he ki "un donon ke dwaara kam se kam 28 bhartiya kuli or iske alawa kai abhaage africa bascindia maare gaye jinka koi aadhikarik record nahin rakhaa gaya"

 The bridge's project was controversial and the British press referred to it as the "madness Express", as critics believed it to be a waste of money, while supporters argued that it was necessary for the transportation of goods
 haalanki pariyojna safal rahi or patterson kaa pul majboot, ise purvi africa abhiyaan main german senaaon dwaara uda diya gaya
 Colonel John Patterson is to build a bridge in East Africa
 jab ve is par kaam kar rahe hai to do aadamkhor sher saamne aate hai
 They do anything for a piece of human flesh and the first attempt to chase, catch or keep them away from the camp failed
 ve shivi aspataal par hamalaa karte hai or ek marij ko maar daalate hai
 Even after the hospital is removed, a lion crosses a thick, thorn-like enclosure known as a boma and drags and kills the filler
 in sheron ke shikaar ke dauraan, patterson kaa saamana laal thook vaale cobra, ek ganda, ek dariyaan ghoda, junglee kutton ke jhund, ek hiran jisane marane kaa naatak kiya or zebra ke ek jhund se hua jisamen se unhone chah zebra pakad liye
 He also shot a new type of antelope, T
 oryx petersonianus
 Finally, Patterson kills the first lion by tying a goat with a high loft - though Patterson himself becomes the prey during some tense moments
 patterson or mahena, duusare sher kaa peechha maidaanon main karte hai
 When they find him and shoot him, the lion attacks him and has to fire several bullets
 pul pariyojna ko puraa karne ke dauraan keval sher hi chunauti nahin he
 Tensions between indigenous workers and Sikhs brought from British East India to work on the project also put the project at risk
 ek bindu par, patterson kaa saamana sher se bhi bade khatre se hota he - bhayankar baadh
 yah baadh aapurti pulon ko baha detii he or lohe ke pattiyon ko pedo ke aas-paas lapet detii he
 The uprooted trees also left no stone unturned to damage the bridge
 But the well-built bridge remains intact
 is chunauti se sabit hota he ki pul par kaam karte hue bitaaye gaye varsh vyarth nahin hai
 After Patterson completes the construction of the bridge, he learns that a lion is trying to destroy the train station
 jab ve dekhne ke liye jate hai, to unhen khun ke bade dhabbe dikhte hai jahaan se sher ne chat ko todane kii koshish kii thi
 There were 3 men in one compartment and an indefinite number of coolies in another
 jab sher ne pravesh kiya to do purush farsh par soye hue the
 The lion was a man trying to attack another
 tisare aadmi ne anya dabbe main jane kii koshish main, jise kuliyon ne apni pagadi se band kar rakhaa tha, sher kii peeth par se chadhate hue tezi se bhaagane kii koshish kii
 The porters opened the door for her arrival and then closed it
 anya aadamiyon ke maamle main ek ko sher ne maar diya or kha gaya jabaki doosraa aadmi chupchaap padaa tha shaayad apni jaan bachaane ke prayaas main
 yah sunakar patterson ne is sher ke peeche jane kaa faisla kiya or ant main use khojkar use maar diya
 Another close encounter with the lion occurs when the lion rides on a gorge
 ghari ek choti trali ke samaan kenya main parivahan kaa saadhan he
 Another time on the way back to the train station, Patterson talks with a friend who had never killed a lion
 kareeb kuch sau gaj kii duuri par, patterson sheron kii ek jodi kii taraf ishaara karata he or apane dost ko unhen goli maarane ke liye protsaahit karata he
 a lion runs away on the first shot, but he successfully kills the second lion
 kitaab ke ant main ek sher kii tasviir he jise dost ne pakadaa tha
 When it comes time for Patterson to leave, some porter and natives want to accompany him
 haalanki, patterson jaanata he ki unamem vah pratiraksha pranali nahin he jo africa ke baahar rogon kaa muqabla kar sake
 So he politely refuses and leaves Africa for a few years

 India does not have a national health insurance or universal health care system for all citizens, resulting in the private sector becoming the major healthcare provider in the country
 vishay vastu The private healthcare sector plays a major role for healthcare in India
 yahan adhikansh swasthya kharch beemaa ke madhyam se hone ke bajaay rogiyon or unke pariwaron dwaara unki jeb bhugtan kiya jaataa hai
 Due to this, very unusual expenditure has to be incurred on health expenses and as a result the financial condition of any family deteriorates
 yahan tak kii jeene kaa ek buniyadi maanako ko banaaye rakhane main pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa hai
 According to the National Family Health Survey-3, the private medical sector is the primary source of health care for 70% of the families living in urban areas and 63% of the families living in rural areas
 vibhivn rajyon ke bich saarvajanik or nijee swasthya dekhbhaal main kaaphi antar hai
 There is a large dependence on the private health sector for many reasons, one of the main reasons being the poor quality of care in the public sector
 57% se adhik pariwaron ne sarvakshan ke dauraan yahi kaaran bataaya
 Most of the public health services are concentrated in rural areas and the quality of services falls as experienced healthcare providers do not visit rural areas
 2014 ke chunaav main jeet ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ke karyaalay sanbhaalane ke baad unki sarkaar ne ek rashtravyapee saarvbhaumik swasthya dekhbhaal pranali kaa anaavaran kiya jise rashtriya swasthya guarantee mishan ke naam se janaa jaataa hai jiskaa mukhya lakshya prayek naagarik ko muft dawaaen, naidanik upachaar or gambhir bimariyon ke liye beemaa uplabdh karana hai
 But the implementation of the universal health care system was delayed for financial reasons
 bharat sarkaar dwaara rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan april 2005 main shuru kiya gaya tha
 The main goal of the National Rural Health Mission is to provide effective healthcare in rural areas and more attention was given to those 18 states where the indicators of healthcare were very low
 doctoron kii aabaadi kaa keval 2% gramin kshetron main rahata hai jaha bharat kii 68% jansakhya rahati hai
 The National Urban Health Mission was approved by the Cabinet on 1 May 2013 as a subsidiary mission of the National Health Mission
 iskaa lakshya shahari aabaadi ke swasthya kii dekhbhaal jaruraton ko puraa karnaa tha evam iskaa mukhya focus shahari garibon par tha evam unhen praathmik swasthya uplabdh karana tha
 India's urban population was 285 million in 2001 and increased to 377 million in 2011, an increase of 31% and is expected to increase to 535 million in 2026
 rashtriya parivaar swasthya surveykshan ke 2005-06 ke aankadon ke vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki bharat kii shahari aabaadi ke liye uplabdh shishu swasthya sevaayen bahut acchhee sthiti main nahin hai
 Maternal health care conditions are not very good among the urban population of India
 It is worth noting here that the proportion of women who have access to healthcare during their maternity is very low
 bharat ke pramukh shahari kshetron main chikitsiya dekhbhaal kii gunvattta pratham vishwa ke maanakon ke kaaphi kareeb he or kabhi-kabhi unase bhi adhik he

 The quality and vast experience is arguably unmatched compared to most other countries

 Performance appraisal, also known as employee appraisal, is a method by which an employee's performance is evaluated
 Performance evaluation is a part of career development
 nishpaadan-moolyankan, sanghathanon main karmchaaree nishpaadan kii niyamit samiksha he
 Generally, performance evaluation has the following objectives: kisi sankhyasuchak yaa adish shrenee paddati kaa prayog karnaa, nishpaadan ko moolyankit karne kaa ek saamaanya tarika he jisamen prabandhakon ko anginat uddeshyon / lakshanon ke aadhaar par kisi vyakti vishesh ko chinhit karne ke liye kaha jaataa he
 In some companies, employees receive appraisals from their managers, equine-employees, subordinate-employees, and customers even after performing self-assessments
 ise 360° moolyankan ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jo acchhee sanchaar vyavastha taiyaar karata he
 The most popular methods used as an performance-evaluation process are: vyavsaayik sansthaaon dwaara aam taur par satyanishtha or antarvivekshiltaa jaise karkon par ashrith lakshan par aadhaarit paddatiyon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The scientific literature on this subject provides evidence that the method of evaluating employees on such factors should be abandoned
 iske dohare kaaran hai: Since by definition symptom-based methods are based on personality traits, the manager has difficulty providing feedback that can lead to positive changes in employee performance
 iskaa kaaran yahi he ki vyaktitv ke aayam adhikansh rup se sthir hote hai or jabaki karmchaaree kisi vishesh vyavhaar ko to parivartit kar saktaa he lekin apane vyaktitv ko parivartit nahin kar saktaa he
 For example, a person who lacks integrity can stop lying to the manager because they have been caught, but they still have little sense of integrity and when the fear of being caught is gone
 Becomes likely to lie to
 chunki lakshan par aadhaarit paddatiyaan aspasht hoti hai, isliye ye badi aasaani se karyaalay kii raajnneeti se prabhavit ho jaati hai jiske kaaran ye kisi karmchaaree ke sateek nishpaadan ke soochna-strot ke rup main kam vishwasaneey hoti hai
 The ambiguity of these tools allows managers to choose what they want or what they feel should be improved, based on the particular behavior of employees Based on the scores, they could also select the behaviors in which they should / should not be engaged
 ye paddatiyaan bhedbhaav ke daavon ke liye kisi company ko khulaa chhod dene jaisaa hi hai kyonki koi bhi prabandhak unke vishesh vyavhaarik soochna kii sahaayta ke bina hi pakshpatpurna nirnay le saktaa he

 jelifish yaa jelly yaa samudri jelly yaa medusosoa, yaa gizgizia nideria sangh kaa mukt-tairaaq sadsy he
 There are many different forms of jellyfish that represent various Nigerian classes including scyphozoa, storozoa, cubozoa and hydrozoa
 in samoohon main jelifish ko, kramshah, scyphomeduse, storomeduse, cubomeduse or hydromeduse bhi kaha jaataa he
 All jellyfish subspecies are embedded in medusozoa
 medusa jelifish ke liye ek or shabd he or isliye jivan-chakra ke vayask charan ke liye vishesh rup se prayukt hota he
 Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the depths of the ocean
 kuch hydrosoai jelifish, yaa hydromeduse tazaa pani main bhi paae jate hai; mithe pani kii prajatiyaan vyas main ek inch, berang hoti hai or dank nahin maarthi hai
 Many well-known jellyfish, such as Aurelia, are scyphomedusae
 ye bade, aksar rangeen jelifish hai, jo vishwa bhar main saamanytah tateey kshetron main paae jate hai
 In its broadest sense, the term jellyfish generally refers to members of the association Tinophora
 haalanki niderian jelifish se koi nikat sambandh nahin he, tinophor mukt-tairaaq planctonic mansabhakshi hai, jo saamanytah paardarshee yaa parbhasi or vishwa ke sabhi mahasaagaron ke uthle se gahare bhaagon main maujuud hote hai
 Lion mane jellyfish are the most well known jellyfish and, arguably, the tallest animal in the world
 chunki jelifish vastav main machhlee nahin hai, shabd jelifish ko mithyaa naam ke rup main mana jaataa he or america saarvajanik machhleegharon ne iske bajaay jelly yaa samudri jelly shabdon ke upyog ko lokapriy banaaya he
 Many other jellyfish, which have been in common practice for more than a century, are equally useful and picturesque and prefer the term more than jelly
 shabd jelifish kaa upyog kai alag prakaar ke niderian ko nirupit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jin sabamein chhatari ke samaan dikhne vaali ek buniyadi shaareerik sanrachana hoti he, jinamein shaamil hai scyphojoi, storosoi, hydrosoi or cubosoi jeev 
 Some textbooks and websites refer to scyphozoi as "real jellyfish"
 iske vyapak upyog main, kuch vaigyanik jab jelifish ko sanderbhit kar rahe hon, kabhi-kabhi sangh tinophora ke sadasyon ko shaamil karte hai
 Other scientists prefer to use the term "gelatinous zooplankton" when referring to them, with soft-bodied animals in the water column
 jelifish ke samooh ko kabhi-kabhi bloom yaa jhund bhi kaha jaataa he
 "bloom" is generally used for large groups of jellyfish that congregate in a small area, but may also include the time component, which is seasonal or greater than expected
 jelifish apane jivan-chakra ke swabhavanusaar "prasphutit" hote hai, jo dhoop or plankaton kii badhotaree par praayah apane nitalsth polip dwaara utpaadit hote hai, jisaki vajah se ve akasmaat prakat hote hai or aksar badi sankhya main, tab bhi jab paristhitiki tantra kaa santulan bana hua he
 The use of "herd" indicates an active ability to live together, such as some species of Aurelia, moon jelly
 anek jelifish main unke jivan-chakra kaa doosraa bhaag hota he, jise polip charan kaha jaataa he
 When a polyp, produced from a single fertilized egg, develops into several polyp clumps attached to each other by fibers of tissue called stolons, they are called "phyla"
 kuch polip kabhi prachurodbhavit nahin hote or unhen "nihsang" upjati ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Jellyfish do not have specialized digestive, osmotic, central nervous, respiratory, or circulatory systems
 ve amashay-vaahikeey vivar ke jathar-twajeey astr kaa upyog karte hue, jahaan poshak tatwon kaa avasorana hota he, pachan karte hai
 They do not need the respiratory system because their skin is so thin that the body oxidizes by diffusion
 unka gati par simit niyantran hota he, lekin ve apane ghantinuma sharir ke sankuchan-spandan ke madhyam se dravasthaitik kankal kaa upyog karte hue sanchalan kar sakate hai; kuch prajatiyaan sakriy rup se adhikansh samay tairti rahati hai, jabaki anya zyaada samay niskriy rahati hai
 Jellyfish are composed of 90% water; Most of the volume of their umbrella is made up of the mucous material called misoglia — a jelly — surrounded by two layers of epithelial cells that make up the bell, or body umbrella and subsection
 jelifish main mastishk yaa kendriya tantrika pranali maujuud nahin hoti, balki bahyatvacha main avasthit tantrikaon kaa dhilaa network rahata he, jise "tantrika jaal" kaha jaataa he
 a jellyfish knows various stimuli, including the touch of other animals, through its neural plexus, which then impulses to the other neural cells around the entire neural plexus and circular neural ring, through the ropial lapel that surrounds the jellyfish's body
 Does
 kuch jelifish main netrak bhi hote hai: prakaash ke prati samvedansheel ang, jo chitra nahin banaate, par jo prakaash kaa pataa laga sakate hai or jal kii sataha par dhoop ke prakaash ke prati pratikriya karte hue, upar or neeche kaa nirdhaaran kar sakate hai
 These are usually pigment point ophthalms, some of which have pigmented cells
 shikaar kii uplabdhta or vardhit taapmaana or dhoop kii pratikriya main sagariya prasphuton kii upasthiti aam taur par mausami hoti he
 Ocean currents tend to collect jellyfish in large swarms or "blooms", which contain hundreds or thousands of jellyfish
 samudri dhaaraon dwaara kabhi-kabhi sankendrit hone ke alaava, prasphuton kuch saalon main asaamaanya rup se ucch aabaadi kaa bhi parinaam ho saktaa he
 Blasting formation is a complex process that is dependent on ocean currents, nutrients, temperature, sedimentation and oxygen concentrations
 jelifish apane pratiyogiyon kii tulana main kam oxigen vaale jal main behatar tareeqe se jivit rahane main sakasham hote hai or is tarah bina pratispardhaa ke plavak par pal sakate hai
 Jellyfish can also benefit from saline water, as salt water contains more iodine, which is necessary to convert polyps into jellyfish
 jalwaayu parivartan se badhate samudri taapmaana bhi jelifish prasphuton main yogadan de sakate hai, kyonki jelifish kii kai prajatiyaan garm pani main behatar rup se jivit rahane main sakasham hai
 Jellyfish are likely to live in large swells and can reach up to 100,000 in each
 logon kii smriti main "chhap" ke alaava, samay ke saath vaishvik jelifish aabaadi main parivartan ke bare main bahut kam data uplabdh he
 Scientists have little quantitative data available of historical or current jellyfish populations
 jelifish aabaadiyon ke bare main haal hi kii atakalein "vigat" data par aadhaarit hai
 The global increase in jellyfish eruption frequency can be caused by human impact
 kuch sthanon par jelifish paristhitik aalon ko bhar sakate hai jis par pehle ab adhik machhliimaar jeevon kaa kabja tha, lekin note kiya gaya he ki is pariklpana main samarthak data kii kami he
 Jellyfish researcher Marsha Youngbluth further clarifies that "jellyfish nourish the same types of young and adult fish, so if the fish are removed from the equation, the jellyfish is likely to take place
" " Some jellyfish populations, which have shown a clear increase over the past few decades, are of other "invasive" species coming from natural habitats: examples include the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, the Baltic Sea, the eastern Mediterranean beaches of Egypt and Israel, and Mexico
 American coast of the Gulf of
 Invasive species populations can expand rapidly as there are often no natural predators present in new habitats to prevent their growth
 zaruri nahin ki aise prasphuton adhik machhleemari yaa anya paryaavarniya samasyaon ko pratibimbit karen
 Increased nutrients, attributed to agricultural flow, have also been cited as the precursor to the jellyfish abundance
 albama ke dophin dweep sagariya prayogshaala ke monti graham kehete hai ki "paristhitiki pranaliyaan, jinamein poshak tatwon kaa ucch str rahaa he

 pani jahaan swasthyapradposhan ho, aksar kam oxigen str main parinat hota he, jisase jelifish par anugrah hota he chunki ve machhlee kii tulana main kam oxigenyukt jal bardaasht kar sakate hai
 The fact that jellyfish are growing is a sign that something is happening in the ecosystem
 " a sample of ocean life off the coast of Namibia suggests that as a result of heavy fishing in the region over the past few decades, jellyfish biomass has overtaken fish
 jelifish dwaara gambhirtha se prabhavit kshetron main shaamil hai uttari mexico khadi, jiske bare main graham kehete hai "moon jeliyon ne ek prakaar kaa shleshiya jaal gathit kiya he jo khadi ke ek chor se duusare chor tak failaa he
 " jelifish prasphuton maanav jati ke liye samasyaayein paidaa karata he
 The most obvious are human stings and tourism declines on the beaches

 The barrier also creates a number of problems including shutting down nuclear power plants and desalination plants, as well as disrupting ship engines and overturning boats by the largest species, the Nomura jellyfish
 anek jelifish apane jivan chakra ke dauraan do alag jivan itihaas charnon se guzarate hai
 The first is the polypoid stage, when the animal takes the shape of a small stalk with nutritive tentacles; This polyp can be localized, living on a lower surface or similar substratum, such as fetters or the bottom of a boat, or it is attached to small pieces of free-floating or free-gv plankton or rarely, to fish or other invertebrates

 In the second stage, small polyps asexually produce jellyfish, each of which is known as medusa
 chote jelifish polip se dur tair kar jate hai or phir plavak par badhate or poshit hote hai
 The medusa has a spherically symmetrical, umbrella-shaped body called a bell, usually consisting of small tentacles, such as bordered tentacles, on the side of the bell that hold the prey
 jelifish kii kuch prajatiyon ke jivan chakra main polip bhaag nahin hota he, lekin ve jelifish se nishechit andon ke sidhe vikaas ke madhyam se jelifish kii agali peedi main jate hai
 Jellyfish are monogamous, meaning they are usually male or female
 zyaadaatar maamalon main, donon aas-paas ke pani main shukranu or andey jari karte hai, jahaan andey nishechit hote hai or nae jeev main paripakv hote hai
 In some species, sperm swim into the female's mouth to fertilize eggs within the female's body where they are present during the early stages of development
 moon jelly main, andey maukhik bahon ke gaddhon main basate hai, jo vikasshil planula larva ke liye ek asthaayee bacchon kaa kaksh banataa he

 After reaching adult size, jellyfish lay eggs every day if there is enough food
 anek prajatiyon main, andjnan prakaash dwaara niyantrit hota he, atah sampurna aabaadi din ke ek hi samay andey detii he, jo aksar subah yaa shaam ko hota he
 Only scyphozoans belonging to the Rhizostome class are captured for food; About 12 of the 85 species are collected and sold in international markets
 adhikansh ekatrikaran dakshinpurv asia main sampann hota he
 Rhizostomes, especially Ropilema esculentum in China and Stomolophus milligris in the United States, are preferred because of their larger and more rigid body and their toxin is not harmful to humans
 jelifish master dwaara sampann paaramparik prasanskaran vidhiyon main 20 se 40 din kaa bahu-charan prakriya shaamil he, jisamen janangranthiyaan or shleshmik jhilliyon ko nikaalane ke baad, chhatari or maukhik bahon ko namak or fitkaree ke mishran se sansaadhit, tathaa sampeedit kiya jaataa he
 Processing reduces fluidity, odor and deforming microorganisms and makes jellyfish dry and acidic, producing "crisp and crispy formation"
 is tareeqe se taiyaar jelifish apane mul vajan kaa 7-10% banaae rakhata he or prasanskarit utpaada main lagbhag 94% jal or 6% protein hota he
 Freshly processed jellyfish have a white, creamy color that turns yellow or brown during prolonged storage
 china main, sansaadhit jelifish ko raat bhar pani main bhigo kar vilwanikrut kiya jaataa he or pakaa kar yaa kaccha khaaya jaataa he
 Dishes are often cut and prepared with oil, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar, or served as a salad with vegetables
 japan main, namak lagaae gaye jelifish ko dhoyaa, pattiyon main kataa or sirka ke saath ek kshudhavardhak ke rup main parosa jaataa he
 Desalinated, ready-to-eat products are also available

 In 1961, Osamu Shimomura of Princeton University, while studying the photoproteins that were the cause of the biopolarity by this species of jellyfish, extracted the green fluorescent protein from the large and abundant Hydromedusa equorea victoria and another bioremediated protein called equorin
 Three decades later, Douglas Prasher, a post-doctoral scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP
 sheeghra hi colombia vishvavidhyalay ke martin chelfi ne pataa lagaaya ki kaise GFP ko anya koshikaon yaa angon main jin ke fluoroscent marker ke rup main sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Roger Sian of the University of California, San Diego later chemically manipulated GFP to acquire other fluorescence colors to be used as markers
 In 2008, Shimomura, Chalfi and Sian won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on GFP
 maanav nirmit GFP kaa ab saamanytah pradipt tag yah darshane ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he ki koun-si koshikaayen yaa utak vishisht jeenon ko vyakt karte hai
 Genetic engineering techniques combine the preferred genes with the GFP gene
 baad main sanyojit DNA ko koshika vanshakram yaa jin ko vahan karne vaale puure jantu ko utpaadit karne ke liye koshika main daal diya jaataa he
 In a cell or animal, the synthetic gene is generated in the same tissues as the normal gene and at the same time
 lekin saamaanya protein banane ke bajaay, jin GFP banaata he
 This can then be done by flashing light on the animal and observing the illumination to determine which tissues can express that protein - or at what stage of development
 Fluorescence refers to where the gene is expressed
 jelifish ko unke kolagen ke liye bhi pakadaa jaataa he, jiskaa amwati gathiya ke upachaar sahit vibhinn prakaar ke anuprayogon ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In many countries jellyfish are displayed in aquariums
 aksar tank kii prishthbhumi neeli hoti he or jaanavar tathaa prishthbhumi ke bich vaishamy ko badhaate hue, jaanwaron ko parshvik prakaash se pradipt kiya jaataa he
 Under natural conditions, many jellies are so transparent that they remain almost invisible

 peshewar pradarshnon main suspasht jal pravaah kii suvidha hoti he, aam taur par gol tankiyon main, taaki namoonon ko konon main funsane se roka ja sake
 The Monterrey Bay Aquarium uses Creasel for this purpose
 jelifish gharelu aquarium main ek lokapriy pravriti banataa ja rahaa he
 It is now possible to buy jellyfish aquariums and live jellyfish online
 vyaktigat upyog ke liye jelifish aquarium jodna bhi sambhav he
 All jellyfish sting their prey, using nematocysts, a stinged structure located in specific cells called a nidocyte, which is characteristic of all neideria
 jelifish ke sparshakon ke saath sampark, lakhon nimatocist dwaara twachaa ko vedhane or vish inject karne ko prerit kar saktaa he, tathaapi keval kuch jelifish prajatiyon kaa dank maanvon main pratikul pratikriya utpann karata he
 When a nematocyst is induced by contact with a predator or prey, it quickly pressures up to 2,000 lbs / square inch until it explodes
 a lance inside the nematocyst pierces the skin of the prey and begins to poison the inside of the prey
 jelifish ko choona yaa uske dwaara chuaa janaa bahut hi asahaj ho saktaa he, kabhi-kabhi jiske liye chikitsa sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he; dank kaa prabhaav, bina koi prabhaav se lekar atyadhik dard or maut tak ho saktaa he
 Due to the wide variation in response to jellyfish stings, it is prudent not to come into contact with jellyfish from exposed skin
 yahaan tak ki samudratati or marane vaala jelifish bhi chhue jane par dank maar saktaa he
 Scyphozoi jellyfish stings are often inconvenient, although not generally fatal, but some species of class Cubozoa, such as the well-known and particularly virulent Irukandji, or box jellyfish can be fatal
 dank kii vajah se tivrograhita ho sakati he, jo maut kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 Therefore, the victims must immediately run out of water
 chikitsa dekharekh main vishrodhi khuraaq bhi shaamil he
 Three goals of first aid for non-complicated jellyfish stings are protection from injury to rescuers, neutralizing nematocysts, and removal of patient-associated tentacles
 Rescuers should wear restrictive clothing, such as panty hoods, wet suits or full-body sting-impermeable suits
 Inactivating nematocysts or sting cells and prevents toxin ingestion
 sirka se box jelifish dank main madad milti he, lekin portugali yoddha dankon se nahin
 For stings on or around the eyes, soak a towel in vinegar and dab it around the eyes, but avoid the eyes
 If vinegar is unavailable, salt water can also be used
 yadi namakeen pani main dank laga ho to tazaa pani kaa istemaal naa karen, kyonki tanaatmak parivartan atirikt vish chhod saktaa he
 Avoid rubbing the wound or using alcohol, spirits, ammonia, or urine that encourage the release of venom
 jagah se jelly, sparshak or nami saafe karne se, nimatocist uttejnaa or bhi kam ho jaati he
 Shaving the affected skin with a knife edge, razor or credit card can also remove the remaining nematocysts
 praathmik chikitsa-sahaayta ke alaava, difinhydermine jaise histaminarodhi twachaa kii jalan ko niyantrit kar sakate hai
 To remove the toxin in the skin, apply baking soda and water to the sting and cover it with a cloth
 If possible, apply the coat again every 15-20 minutes
 Up to the achievement of any one of these snow can prevent the poison from spreading

 kavy ke swaroop ke sambandh main anek pracheen siddhant yug yug main prachlit hue, parantu prayek mat main kuch na kuch aruchi pai jaati he
 The poetic definition of Ransgangadhar pacifies these Aruchis, and she reaches a verdict by giving a fundamental discussion on the nature and significance of the poetic miracle
 rasgangadhar ke anusaar romaniyata ko hi kavy kaa sarvasv mana he
 Sahridyahlad is the object of poetry and the poet's supernatural talent is its origin

 This book is the founder of the sound community

 The great feature settled is that not only the symptom is fundamental in it, but the example of the target subject is published by the author himself, whether the example is of virtue or defect
 rasgangadhar main "naprasy kinchit' pratigya ke apurv nirvaah ne ise anya kavyashastreey granthon se kahin ucch sthaan dilaane main sahyog diya he
 In this book, fundamental principles have been established by deferring the principles of Mammat, Vishwanath and Appay Dixit

 In the first instance, the definition of poetry and the definition of poetry is discussed with a very soft-hearted view of rasasarupa and bhavadhvani
 dwitiya aanan main shabdashakti ke pratipaadan ke pashchaat alankaar prakaran prarambh hota he, jo keval uttaralankar ke nirupan tak hi uplabdh hota he
 Scholars believe that in the remaining seats, Panditraj must have considered other poetic elements and also the characteristics of visual poetry
 rasgangadhar par sarvapracheen ek tikaa "gurumarmaprakash" naamak uplabdh he jisaki rachana vaiyaakaran nagesh ke dwaara hui he
 This commentary was largely unsuccessful in doing the requisite justice with the original book; In many cases this commentary also has a lot of misconceptions

 Later, the people of China, Greece and Rome adopted the method of keeping their food and beverages frost by natural snow
 iske baad kritrim barf banane ke hetu prashithan kii yantric vidhiyon kaa avishkaar kiya gaya
 The refrigeration system can be achieved by the following measures: pani yaa barf main namak ke sanyog se barf ke tukdon se saamanyatya pani chipka rahata he
 When salt is mixed with them, it melts in the water and the ice melts
 vilyan ooshmaa or barf galane kii gupt ooshmaa usee mishran se praapt hoti hai tathaa falswaroop mishran kaa taap kaa yah patan ek nishchit seemaa se adhik nahin ho saktaa
 When the temperature of the mixture is about -21
20 c Reaches, then its collapse stops and no change is made by adding more salt to that solution
 is taap ko galnakranthik taap kehete hai
 After the solution has arrived at this temperature, it cannot dissolve much salt
 neeche kuch lavenon ke, jo pani main ghul sakate hai, naam or unke sangat galan kranthik taap ke maan die ja rahe hai : When a fluid boils, its evaporation, ie, the conversion of liquid to vapor, requires heat, which is called latent heat of evaporation
 yadi koi drav kisi vidhi se atyant drut gati se vashpit karaayaa jaay or use anya kisi strot se ooshmaa na mil sake to vah apane andar kii ooshmaa ke vyay se hi vashpit hota he
 As a result, it starts to cool down
 is siddhant kaa prayog vishaal paimaane par aadhunik yantric prashithan upkarnon main kiya jaataa he
 Water is not used in this, because although the latent heat of its evaporation is quite high, its vapor pressure is low at low temperatures
 is kaary ke liye ammonia, sulfur dioxide ityadi kaa prayog hota he
 The mechanical refrigeration system is a practical application of thermodynamics, in which refrigerant is passed through an inverse thermodynamic cycle
 yah chakra ek ingine yaa vidyut motor dwaara chalata he or is chakra main nimna taap par ooshmaa kaa nissaran hota he
 The reversal ear-chakra may be useful for this purpose, but in some respects the prevailing refrigeration cycles are different from the ear chakra, mainly due to the action of reducing the pressure of the fluid by the evaporative valve before entering the evaporation coils
 isse kaanon ke chakra ke liye abhisht sthiroshm prasar kii kriya hona sambhav nahin rah jaataa
 Vapor compression, absorption, steam-jet and air cycle are notable among the commonly used refrigeration cycles
 in chakron ko samajhane se purv ooshmaa chakra samaj lenaa aavashyak he
 When a compressed is suddenly given the opportunity to be induced by a stable method, it cools down, because it does not get the energy required for work done in diffusion from the external environment, but only from inside
 isse uskaa taap is seemaa tak ho saktaa hai ki vah thos ke rup main jam jaay
 Some compression refrigerators have been built on this principle, in which air is used as a refrigerant gas
 isamen vaayu ko pehle khub kiya jaataa he or is kriya main utpann ooshmaa se gas ko nivrutt hone ke hetu vaayu kaa prayog hota he
 In this, the air is consumed first - and air is used to expel the gas from this action and the heat generated in this process
 isamen vaayu ko prasarbelan ke sthiroshm dhang se prasarit karaayaa jaataa he, jisase belan tathaa vaayu ko hi thande ho jate hai
 It enters the cold air and compressed air propagation news, where it has a steady diffusion
 yah paryaapt thandi ho jaati he or prasheetak ke sheet sanchayak koshth yaa shitagaar main pahunchakar use sheethal karti he
 This causes it to reheat and reach the compressor and it starts again
 is prakaar ke sampidak main pahunchati he or yah pun: aarambh hota he
 The practical form of this type of compressor is the Kielman refrigerant, which is used in the cold accumulator cells of homes
