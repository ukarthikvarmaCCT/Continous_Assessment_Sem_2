'whoever calls me Syed will be punished in hell, who will call me Aryan, he will get swings of extermination, Aryan and Syed are born here and there, God does not care about the beauty, he pushes the beautiful beyond and embraces the ugly

 Bhagavata Dharma is the most famous and popular form of Vaishnavism
 'bhagwat dharm' kaa taatpary us dharm se he jiske upasya swayan bhagavan hon
 And Vasudev Krishna is the voice of the word 'god', so Krishna is the supreme being in the Bhagavata religion whose worship is proven by devotion and gives the devotees the connection and servitude of God
 saamanyat: yah naam vaishnav sampradaayon ke liye vyavahrut hota he, parantu yatharthat: yah unamem ek vishisht sampradaay kaa bodhak he
 The mahamantra of the Bhagavatas is 'namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya' which is conferred with the noun of Dwadashekra mantra
 pancharaatr tathaa vaikhanas mat 'narayan' ko hi param tatv maanate hai, parantu inase vipareet bhagwat mat krishna vasudev ko hi parmaradhy maanata he
 The antiquity of this religion is distinguished by numerous corroborative evidence
 gupt samrat apane ko 'param bhagwat' kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit karne main gaurav kaa anubhav karte the
 As a result, this title is essentially mentioned with their names in their rock writings
 vikrampurv pratham tathaa dwitiya shatabdiyon main bhagwat dharm kii vyapaktaa tathaa lokapriyata shilalekhon ke sakshya par nirvivaad siddh hoti he
 In the first century BCE, Mahaakshatrapa Shodash was the ruler of Mathura Mandal
 uske samakaleen ek shilaalekh kaa ullekh he ki vasu naamak vyakti ne mahasthaan main bhagavan vasudev ke ek chatu:shawl mandir, torana tathaa vedika kii sthapana kii thi
 This is the first mention of the construction of Krishna's temple in Mathura
 nanaghat ke guhabhilekh main anya devon ke saath sankarshan tathaa vasudev kaa naam bhi lakhanu sangrahalay main surakshit sankarshan kii dvibhuji pratimaa isi yug kii maani gai he
 The famous inscription of Besnagar holds special significance in this subject
 is shilaalekh kaa kahana he ki heliodor ne devadhidev vasudev kii pratishtha main is garudastambh kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 It was the son of Diya, resident of Taxila, who lived in the court of King Bhagabhadra as the messenger of Yavanaraja named Antalikit
 unani rajdoot apane ko 'bhagwat' kahata he
 The historical peculiarity of this inscription is that Vasudev Devadhidev was considered in that era and his followers were known by the name 'bhagavata'
 bhagwat dharm bharat ke pashchimottar pradesh tak failaa hua tha or yah videshi unaniyon ke dwaara samaadrut hota tha
 a review of the sources of the ancient Maharishi Panini from the Patanjal Mahabhashya is undeniable evidence to prove the antiquity of the Bhagavata religion
 panini ne 'vasudevargjunabhyaan bun' sutara main vasudev kii bhakthi karanevaale vyakti ke arth main n pratyay kaa vidhaan kiya he jisase vasudev bhakt ke liye 'vasudevak' shabd nishpann hota he
 By the commentary of this sutra and Pradeep's practice, 'vasudeva' means doubtless the divine, not the son of a Kshatriya named Vasudeva: sangyaesha tatra bhagavat: Nitya: Parmatmadevata, special ih Vasadevo grihayate kaiyat kaa kathan he ki yahan nity paramatma devtaa hi 'vasudev' shabd se gruhit kiya gaya he
 Kashika confirms this meaning, in the same tradition, the meaning of 'vasudeva' has been divineized in Tattvabodhini
 pantajali ke dwaara 'kansavadh' tathaa 'balibandhan' naatakon ke abhinay kaa ullekh spashtat: krishna vasudev kaa aikya 'vishnu' ke saath siddh kar rahaa he : ise webar, kith, grearsan aadi paashchaatya vidvan bhi maanate hai
 It is proved by these evidences that Bhagwat religion became prestigious in the era of Panini
 itnaa hi nahin, us yug main devon kii pratimaa bhi mandiron main yaa anyatra sthapit kii jaati thi
 In such a situation, Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador of the court of Chandragupta Maurya, about three hundred years from Panini, mentions the worship of a deity called 'herikliis' in an Indian race called 'saurasenaai' associated with Mathura and Yamuna, not an opportunity to surprise us
 Happen
 'hericleas' shaury kaa pratimaan banakar sankarshan kaa dyotak ho, chaahe krishna kaa
 His worship is an undeniable proof of propagation and propagation of Bhagwat religion
 bhagwat dharm apni udaartaa or sahishnutaavriti ke kaaran atyant prakhyat he
 In this religion, the door to initiation was never closed to anyone
 bhagavan vasudev ke prati prem rakhanevaala prayek jeev is dharm main aa saktaa he, chaahe vah jatya koi bhi ho tathaa gunat: kitna bhi neech ho
 This famous statement of the Bhagavata Purana is a clear indication of the righteousness of the Bhagavata religion: kiraat hoondhraan pulind pulksaa Aabhrikanka Yavana Khashaday:
 yenye papa yadupashrayashraya: Shuddhyanti Tasmai Prabhavishnave Namah
 
 Shloka implies that the wild and heretical castes like Kirat, Hun, Andhra, Pulind, Pulkas, Aabhira, Kank, Yavan, Khash etc
 and other sinful people have received purification by taking shelter of the devotees of God, salutations to those influential Gods
 yavan heliodor kaa bhagwat dharm main dikshit hona is path kaa aitihaasik poshak pramaan he
 It is an undeniably suggestive and evocative of the tolerant attitude of the Bhagavats
 bhagwat mat main ahimsa kaa samrajya he
 The Bhagavata faith is not opposed to the rituals of the Vedic yagyagas, but it is a strong antagonist of violence in Vedic yajnas, the narration of the Bhagavadkha king Uparichar of Narayana festival confirms this principle
 us narpathi ne mahan ashwamedh kiya, parantu usamen kisi prakaar ke pashu kaa hinson tathaa balidaan nahin kiya gaya 
 'maa Hinsyat Sarva Bhootani' was the first to follow this eloquence literally and Bhagavatas followed it in their Acharyanushanas
 bhagwat mat kaa sarvshereshth maanya granth he : shrimadbhagwat jo ashtadash puraanon main apane vishayvivechan kii praudhata tathaa kavyamayi sarasata ke kaaran sabase adhik mahatvashaalee he 
 The principles of Bhagwat are important and honorable principles of Bhagavadharma
 bhagwat kaa kathan he ki parmarthat: ek hi advay gyaan he
 The same is called 'brahma' by the Jnanis, 'paramatma' by the Yogis and 'god' by the Bhagavadbhaktas

 That is why, even when he is multi-faceted, he is monogamous
 vishnupurana ke 'ekaane swaroopaay' tathaa gopaltapini ke 'akopi san bahudhaa yo vibhaati' vaakya kaa lakshya isi achintya shakti kii ore he
 Because of this power, God makes the creation, condition and destruction of this virtuous world in spite of his formless, bodyless or self-agile form, but in spite of having the power of these trades, he does not produce any kind of selling
 isliye bhagavan kaa viharayog du:khabodh he, samajhane main nitant kathin he : Grief-enlightenment and tantra-viharayoga: If the Asharano body, idamanavekshi tatamtasamvaya atmanva avikriyamaina sagunamaguna: srjasi pasi harasi

 'tadekatmakarupa' appears to be similar to the figure, shape and different from the Charitadikas even when they are united with the Self
 shaktiyon ke utkarsh or hraas ke kaaran is rup main do prakaar hote hai : vilaas tathaa swansh
 The form of 'vilas' is fundamentally different in shape, but in qualities it is often the same
 vilaas main shakti kaa prakatya adhik hota he, parantu 'swansh' main shakti kaa prakatya tadpekshaya nune hota he
 Despite having the power of infinite qualities of self, the existence of 64 qualities and the existence of four qualities among them is always and universally believed
 ye gun hai : The harmony of these four in Krishna is the ultimate way to prove their godliness
 'aavesh' rup main bhagavan jeevon main newnaadhik rup se apni shakti kaa aadhaan karte hai

 waanchhntyapi maya dattan kaivalyampunarbhavam
 
 bhagavan kaa bhi aagrah mukti kii apeksha bhakthi par hi adhik he
 They offer salvation to the devotees on demand, but not devotion: xxrep 6 
 bhagavan bhajataan mukundo Muktin Dadati Kahhichit Smn Bhaktiogam
 
 Achievement of salvation on the strength of intense knowledge is a commonly known business, but the attainment of devotion is only achieved by the grace of God
 mukti kii apeksha bhakthi ke aakarshan kaa ek gopneey rahasy he
 By virtue of knowledge, the status of love of God is higher than that of Brahmananda, because Brahmananda is not rasa, but devotion is ritual
 vaasana ke vinaash se utpann anand ko bhakt tanik bhi nahin chahta, vah vaasana ke vishodhan se jaayman alokik rasanand ke liye lalayit rahata he
 That is why liberation is a class of devotion
 parantu yah bhakthi sadhanroopa baidhi bhakthi nahin he, apitu sadhyaroopa raganuga premabhakti he jiske vishay main bhagwat pravar prahlaad kaa yah anubhoot kathan he : Neither dan nor tapo nejya nor defecation fast
