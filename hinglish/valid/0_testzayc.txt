 The wholesale price index is a price index that represents the collective average price of some selected commodity
 bharat or philippines aadi desh thok mulya suchakank main parivartan ko mahangaai main parivartan ke suchak ke rup main istemaal karte hai
 But India and the United States are now using the producer price index
 bharat main thok mulya suchakank ko aadhaar maan kar mahangaai dar kii gananaa hoti he
 However, due to the large difference between the wholesale price and the retail price, some people do not consider this method to be correct
 thok mulya suchakank ke liye ek aadhaar varsh hota he
 The wholesale price index is currently being calculated in India as per the base year of 2011-12
 iske alaava vastuon kaa ek samooh hota he jinke ausat mulya kaa utaar-chadhaav thok mulya suchakank ke utaar-chadhaav ko nirdhaarit karata he
 If we talk about India, then there are 435 substances included in the wholesale price index, which are all kinds of food items like food grains, metals, fuels, chemicals etc
 and it is tried in their selection to represent every aspect of the economy
 aadhaar varsh ke liye sabhi 435 saamaanon kaa suchakank 100 maan liya jaataa he
 Suppose we have to find the wholesale price index of wheat for the year 2004
 agar 1994 main gehun kii qeemat 8 rupe prati kilo thi or varsh 2004 main yah 10 rupe prati kilo he to qeemat main antar hua 2 rupe kaa
 Now, if we take this difference in percentage, then it is 25 percent
 aadhaar varsh ke liye suchakank 100 mana jaataa he, isliye varsh 2004 main gehun kaa thok mulya suchakank hoga 100+25 yani 125
 Similarly, all the 435 substances are extracted and added to the WPI
 lekin aisa karte samay agar ye lagata he ki arthvyavastha main kisi khaas saamaan kii upyogita adhik he to suchakank main uski hissedari kaa bhaarank ko kritrim taur par badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 It takes time to pick up the wholesale price of goods and prepare the index, so the inflation rate is always two weeks earlier
 bharat main har hafte thok mulya suchakank kaa akalan kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the estimation of inflation rate also shows the changes in prices during the week
 ab maan lijie 13 june ko khatm hue hafte main thok mulya suchakank 120 he or yah batch kar bees june ko 122 ho gai
 So the percentage difference is about 1
6 percent and this is considered the inflation rate
 america, britain, japan, frans, canada, singapore, china jaise deshon main mahangaai kii dar khudara mulya suchakank ke aadhaar par tay kii jaati he
 This index includes the prices of goods or services that a common consumer purchases
 isliye arthshaastriyon ke ek tabake kaa kahana he ki bharat ko bhi isi aadhaar par mahangaai dar kii gananaa kerani chahie jo aam logon ke lihaaz se zyaada sateek hogi
 The Retail Price Index in India is derived separately for industrial workers, urban laborers, agricultural laborers and rural laborers, but this data is always about a year old
