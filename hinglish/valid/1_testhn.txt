 It is one of the few sun temples of India
 san 1984 main unesco ne ise vishwa dharohar sthal ke rup main manyata di he
 This temple was dedicated to Surya-deva, meaning extracts, which the locals called biranchi-narayan
 isi kaaran is kshetra ko use arq-kshetra yaa padam-kshetra kaha jaataa tha
 According to the Puranas, Lord Krishna's son Samb had developed leprosy due to his curse
 samb ne mithravan main chandrabhaga nadi ke sagar sangam par konark main, baarah varshon tak tapasya kii or surya dev ko prasann kiya tha
 Suryadev, who was the destroyer of all diseases, had also prevented its disease
 tadnusaar samb ne surya bhagwaan kaa ek mandir nirmaan kaa nishchay kiya
 Taking a bath in the Chandrabhaga river, after his destruction, he found a statue of Suryadev
 yah murti suryadev ke sharir ke hi bhaag se, devshilpi shri vishwakarma ne banaayi thi
 Samb installed this idol in a temple in his built Mitravan, since then this place came to be considered sacred
 yah kai itihaaskaaron kaa mat he, ki konark mandir ke nirmaankarta, raja langool nrisinghdev kii akaal mrityu ke kaaran, mandir kaa nirmaan kaary khatai main pad gaya
 As a result, the unfinished structure collapsed
 lekin is mat ko aitihaasik aankadon kaa samarthan nahin miltaa he
 According to the figures of the Madal Register of Puri and some 1278 AD copper sheets, it was revealed that King Langul Narsinghdeva ruled till 1282
 kai itihaaskaar, is mat ke bhi hai, ki konark mandir kaa nirmaan 1253 se 1260 i
 ke bich hua tha
 Therefore, the incomplete construction of the temple is not logical to be the reason for its collapse
 yahan par mandir kii dhwastata ke sampoorn kaarnon kaa ullekh karnaa jatil kaary se kam nahin he
 But it is well known that much of it has now been destroyed
 jiske mukhya kaaran vaastu dosha bhi kaha jaataa he parantu muslim akramanon kii bhoomika ahm rahi he
 It is said that this temple was eroded in just 800 years due to its architectural defects
 jise vaastu kala va niyamon ke viruddh kaha-suna jaataa he
 For this reason, even before its time period, it collapsed despite being a unique example of Rigveda and Stone Art
 is surya-mandir ke mukhya vaastu dosha hai:-
 According to many legends, a magnetic stone is placed on the summit of the Sun Temple
 iske prabhaav se, konark ke samudr se guzarane vaale sagarpot, is ore khinche chale aate hai, jisase unhen baari kshati ho jaati he
 According to another legend, due to this stone, the magnetic direction representation devices of ships do not tell the right direction
 is kaaran apane poton ko bachaane hetu, muslim navik is pathar ko nikaal le gayi
 This stone was acting as a central stone, so that all the stones in the temple walls were in balance
 iske hatane ke kaaran, mandir kii deevaaron kaa santulan kho gaya or parinamtah ve gir padin
 But there is no historical description of this incident, nor is there any description of the existence of any such magnetic central stone
 konark mandir ke girane se sambandhi ek ati mahatvapurn siddhant, kalapahad se judaa he
 According to the history of Orissa, Kalapahad invaded here in 1508 and destroyed many Hindu temples of Orissa including Konark temple
 puri ke jagannatha mandir ke madan panji bataate hai, ki kaise kalapahaad ne urisa par hamalaa kiya
 He also demolished the statues of most Hindu temples, including the Konark temple
 haalanki konark mandir kii 20-25 feet moti deevaaron ko todna asambhav tha, usne kisi prakaar se dadhinauti ko hilaane kaa prayojan kar liya, jo ki is mandir ke girane kaa kaaran bana
 Due to the removal of Dadhinauti, the temple started to fall slowly and due to heavy stone falling from the roof, the roof of the silent hall also collapsed
 usne yahan kii adhikansh murtiyon or konark ke anya kai mandir bhi dhwast kar diye
 In 1568, the terror of Muslims in Orissa was under control
 parantu iske baad bhi hindu mandiron ko todane ke nirantar prayaas hote rahe
 At this time, the pandas of Jagannath temple of Puri removed the idol of Lord Jagannath from the shrine and hid it in a secret place
 isi prakaar, konark ke surya mandir ke pandon ne pradhan devtaa kii murti ko hataa kar, varshon tak ret main dabaa kar chipaaye rakhaa
 Later, this idol was sent to Puri and placed there in the temple of Indra, located in the courtyard of the Jagannath temple
 anya logon ke anusaar, yahaan kii puja murtiyon abhi bhi khoji jaani baaki hai
 But many people say that the idol of Surya Dev, which is kept in the National Museum of New Delhi, is the main worship idol of Konark
 phir bhi konark main, surya vandana mandir se murti ke hatane ke baad se band ho gayi
 Due to this, pilgrims stopped coming to Konark
 konark kaa pattan bhi daakuon ke hamale ke kaaran, band ho gaya
 Konark was a famous city for commercial activities similar to Surya Vandana, but due to the closure of these activities, it became completely uninhabited and was covered with a deep forest for years
 san 1626 main, khurda ke raja, nrisingh dev, suputr shri purushottam dev, suryadev kii murti ko do anya surya or chandra kii murtiyon sahit puri le gayi
 Now they meet in the courtyard of the temple of Puri
 puri ke madal panji ke itihaas se gyaat hota he, ki san 1028 main, raja nasinghdev ne konark ke sabhi mandiron ke naap-jokh kaa aadesh diya tha

 As mentioned earlier, in front of the mouthpiece, there was a large stone block - Navagraha Pat
 khurda ke tatkaaleen raja ne vah khand hatwa diya, saath hi konark se kai shilp krit pashaan bhi le gaya
 And used them in the construction of the temple of Puri

 It is also reported that all parts of the Nat temple have been in their original state for the longest period of time
 or inhen maratha kaal main jaan boojh kar anupayogi bhaag samaj kar todaa gaya
 In 1779, a Maratha monk removed the Arun Pillar of Konark and got it installed in front of the Sinhwar Gate of Puri
 aththarahavin shatabdi ke ant tak, konark ne apana, sara vaibhav kho diya or ek jangal main badal gaya
 Along with this, the area of the temple also became a forest, where there were bases of wild animals and bandits

 There are three idols of Sun God in this temple: iske pravesh par do singh haathiyon par aakraamak hote hue raksha main tatpar dikhaaye gaye hai
 It is probably a symbol of the dominance of the then Brahmin lions in the form of Buddhist elephants

 vishnu kaa nivas ksheer sagar he
 His sleeping is over Sheshnag
 unki naabhi se camel utpann hota he jisamen brahma ji sthit hai
 He holds the Padma in his lower left hand, the mace in his lower right hand, the conch in the upper left hand and the chakra in his upper right hand
 'vishnu' shabd kii vyutpatti mukhyatah 'vish' dhaatu se hi maani gayi he
 In Nirukta, Yasakacharya has taken the word 'vishnu' in the sense of 'vyapati' and termed it as 'vishnu'
 vaikalpik rup se 'vish' dhaatu ko bhi 'pravesh' ke arth main liya gaya he, 'kyonki vah vibhu hone se sarvatra pravesh kiya hua hota he
 Adi Shankaracharya has also considered the meaning of the word 'vishnu' broadly in his Vishnusahsrnama-bhasya, and has clearly written as its etymology that "vishu, the epithet of vyasth meaning, becomes 'vishnu' in the form of metal" Vishnu " 
 'vish' dhaatu ko unhone bhi vikalp se hi liya he or likhaa he ki "athwa nuk pratyyant 'vish' dhaatu kaa rup vishnu he; jaisaa ki vishnupurana main kaha he-- 'us mahatma kii shakti is sampoorn vishwa main pravesh kiye hue hai; isliye vah vishnu kehalaata he, kyonki 'vish' dhaatu kaa arth pravesh karnaa he"
 Major commentators of the Rigveda have also broadened the meaning of the word 'vishnu' with one voice
 vishnusukt kii vyakhya main acharya sayan 'vishnu' kaa arth vyapnsheel tathaa sarvavyaapak karte hai; to shripad damodar satavlekar bhi iskaa arth vyapaktaa se sambaddh hi lete hai
 Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati has also taken the meaning of 'vishnu' omnipresent universally and has also taken the meaning of supreme scholar in many places
 is prakaar suspasht parilakshith hota he ki 'vishnu' shabd 'vish' dhaatu se nishpann he or uskaa arth vyapanyukt he
 In the Vedic Dev-tradition, Vishnu's place is secondary to the numerical point of view of the Suktas because his eulogy is performed in only 5 Suktas; But if they are not looked at from a numerical point of view and consider them from other aspects, then their importance comes out very high
 rugveda main unhen 'brihachharir', yuvakumar aadi visheshnon se khyapit kiya gaya he
 The nature and characteristics of Vishnu mentioned in the Rigveda can be observed in the following points: - vishnu kii anupam visheshta unke teen paad-prakshep hai, jinka rugveda main baarah baar ullekh miltaa he
 Probably this is his biggest feature
 unke teen pad-kram madhu se paripurna kahe gayi hai, jo kabhi bhi ksheen nahin hote
 His three rankings are so elaborate that entire folk exist in them
 ‘tredha vichkramanh’ bhi prakaaraantar se unke teen paad-prakshepon ko dhvanit karata he
 The terms 'uruguay' and 'urukram' are also reflective of the said fact
 madhu se aapurit unke teen pad-kram main se do drushtigochar hai, teesraa sarvatha agochar
 This third highest position has been called the flight of birds and beyond the mortal eye
 yask ke purvavarti shakpuni in teen paad-prakshepon ko brahmand ke teen bhaagon-- prithvi, antariksh or dhuloak main surya kii sanchaar gati ke pratik maanate hai
 Yasak's predecessor Aurnavabha considers him to be the covenant of the rising of the sun, the position in the mid-day and the setting
 tilak mahoday inase varsh ke tridhavibhaajan kaa sanket maanate hai
 If seen, most scholars consider Vishnu to be a sun-vachhi, one of his footprints from midday till midday, second footfall from midnight to midnight and third footfall from postwar to posthumous rise
 inhen purvokt do paad-prakshepon ko drushtigochar or tisare ko agochar kaha gaya he
 But many scholars including mcdanal also say that in this sense how can the third stage be considered as 'supreme'? Therefore, they, like the aforesaid Shakpuni, consider the three steps to be the path through the three worlds of the solar deity
 surya kii kalpana kaa hi samarthan karte hue mcdanal ne vishnu dwaara apane 90 ashwon ke sanchalit kiye jane kaa ullekh kiya he, jinamein se pratye ke chaar-chaar naam hai
 Thus 90 multiplied by 4 numbers means 360 horse, which they consider to be integral since the days of a solar year
 vastutah vishnu ke do padon se sampoorn vishwa kii niyantranaatmakataa tathaa tisare pad se unka param dham arthath unki prapti sanketit he
 In the Rigveda itself, these three verses have been given a mysterious explanation
 isliye is pad ko gyanatmak maanakar rugveda main hi spasht kaha gaya he ki vishnu kaa param pad gyaniyon dwaara hi gyatavya he
 Although Vishnu is also considered to be a resident of Vani, but his most beloved abode, 'path:' is well-known in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan ne ‘giri’ pad ko shlisht maanakar uskaa arth 'vaani' ke saath-saath lakshanik rup main ‘parvat ke samaan unnat lok’ bhi kiya he
 If 'giri' is accepted in both these ways, then the problem is solved
 vishnu kaa teesraa pad jahaan pahunchataa he vahi unka awaas sthaan he
 The world of Vishnu is the 'ultimate post', that is, it is the best form of destination
 us ‘param pad’ kii visheshta yah he ki vah atyadhik prakaash se yukt he
 There cows with many horns transmit there
 ‘gaavah’ yahan shlisht pad kii tarah he
 The meaning of the physical confirmation of milk, etc
, when there is 'cow' meaning from the pun and 'rays', there is a lot of light that is easily permissible for light, that is, spiritual progress
 vishnu ke ‘param pad’ main madhu kaa sthaayee utsa he
 This 'madhu' is also rejoicing to the gods
 is shlisht pad kaa jo bhi arth kiya jaay par vah har sthiti main parmanand kaa vaachak he, jiske liye devtaa sahit samast praani abhilaashi bhi rahete hai or prayatnsheel bhi
 Therefore, everyone wishes for the attainment of the said world
 usee mantra main vahaan punyashalee logon kaa, tripti kaa anubhav karte hue ullekh bhi hua he
 a prominent feature of Vishnu is his friendship with Indra
 indra ke saahchary main hi unke teen paad-prakshepon kaa pravartan hota he
 Together with Indra, he destroys the 99 forts of the Shambar monster
 isi prakaar vah vrutra ke saath sangram main bhi indra kii sahaayta karte hai
 Both have also been described with some other powers
 is prakaar vishnu dwaara sompaan kiya janaa or indra dwaara teen paad-prakshep kiya janaa bhi varnit he
 In the Rigveda, Mandal 6, Sukta 69, there is a homage to the two deities
 isi prakaar rugveda ke mandal 5, sookt 87 main indra ke sahchar marudganon ke saath unki sahastuti praapt hoti he
 The word Vishnu derived from Vishnu Dhatu literally means 'broad, dynamic, functional or enterprising'
 apane bal-vikram ke hi kaaran ve logon dwaara stut hote hai
 They are eternal semen
 is gun ke kaaran hi unhen pratik rup se ‘vrishna’ bhi mana gaya he
 They are the cause of fear of enemies due to their semen or heroic deeds
 unase log usee prakaar bhaybheet rahete hai, jis prakaar kisi parvatachaari singh se
 With the utterances of 'parameshvaradbhiti', etc
, it is proved to fear the common people
 unase bhaybheet hona akaaran nahin he
 They are about to commit acts of violence etc
 yahan yah dhyatavya he ki ve kutsit hinsadikarta kaa hi vadh karte he
 Therefore it has been said for them that they are not murderers
 vishnu visteern, vyapak or apratihat gati vaale hai
 The terms 'urugay' and 'urukram' are a source of this fact
 ‘urugay’ kaa arth acharya sayan dwaara ‘mahjjanon dwaara stuyaman’ athwa ‘prabhutatya stuyaman’ karne se bhi vishnu kii mahima vikhandit nahin hoti
 Dr
 Yadunandan Mishra says that we are urged to make the meaning of this term 'with a wide speed', because it has been said to be a 'transmitter in all worlds'
 unke pad-kram itane sudeergh hote hai ki ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 If the creation of Vishnu's three stanzas, establish and hold them, then they also nurture dependent people there
 logon ko apana bhogy annadi unheen teen pad-kramon ke prasadswarup praapt hota he, jisase ki ve param tripti kaa anubhav kiya karte hai
 Those who praise Vishnu, they always do well, because their eulogy gives them the utmost energy
 is prakaar sphurti-pradaayini stuti vishnu tak pahunchaa paane ke liye sabhi lalayit rahete hai
 They are senior donors
 vishnu ke gunon main bhi trayaatmakataa parilakshith hoti he
 He is of three rank-order, three types of speed, measuring the three worlds and holding the Loktraya
 isi prakaar vah ‘tridhaatu’ arthath sat, raj or tam kaa samikrut rup athwa prithvi, jal or tej se yukt bhi hai
 Vishnu is the creator of earthly regions and the establishment of the most elaborate space etc
 ve swanirmit lokon main teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale hai
 These three movements symbolize their origin, status and merger
 is prakaar jad-jangam sabhi ke ve nirmaataa bhi hai, paalak bhi or vinaashak bhi
 He is the 'sole holder of Loktray'
 ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se akele hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 By measuring Loktraya, it also results that Loktraya means that the entire living beings are under his complete control
 vishnu bhrun-rakshak bhi hai
 Vishnu is prayed to protect the womb seed and the birth of a beautiful child
 unke paalak swaroop par spasht bal dene ke kaaran rugveda main ahoratr agnirup main bhi unhen 'vishnurgopa paraman paati

' arthath sabake rakshak-paalak kaha gaya he
 Acharya Saiyan also clearly considers Vishnu to be 'observant' in the interpretation of the twelfth mantra of the twenty-fifth Sukta of the Eighteenth Circle of the Rigveda
 xxrep 4 
 Therefore, in the overall perspective, Vishnu has been called the supreme benefactor in the Rigveda
 sarvaadhik mantron main varnit hone ke baavjood indra ko 'sukrit' or vishnu ko 'sukruttarah' kaha gaya he
 'sukritarah' has been interpreted by Acharya Sayan as 'the best of those who give good fruit'; Shripad Satavalekar ji has given the meaning 'best among those who do good deeds' and Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati ji has also given the meaning 'ative best deeds
' indra 'sukrit' he to vishnu 'sukruttarah' hai
 The meaning is clear that it is assumed in the Rigveda that Vishnu is supreme
 isi prakaar indra ke raja hone ke baavjood vishnu kii sarvocchata rugveda main hi is baat se bhi spasht ho jaati he ki usamen vishnu ke liye kaha gaya he ki "ve sampoorn vishwa ko akele dhaaran karte hai" tathaa indra ke liye kaha gaya he ki ve rajya karte hai
 The meaning is clear that Vishnu, the creator and foster of the universe, has made Indra the king for operation
 is susandarbhit pariprekshya main vishnu kii sarvocchata se sambaddh brahman granthon evam baad kii puranic manyataayen bhi swatah udbhasith ho uthati hai
 In the Brahmin era, there was a lot of development of yajna-sanstha and with this, the importance of Vishnu in Deomandali became more than before
 aitarey brahman ke armbh main hi yajna main sthaan dene ke kram main agni se armbh kar vishnu ke sthaan ko 'param' kaha gaya he
 Among them is the place of other gods
 is tarah spasht rup se vaidic samhita granthon main sarvapramukh sthaan praapt agni kii apeksha vishnu ko atyucch sthaan diya gaya he
 In fact, Vishnu has been considered great in the Rigveda, but due to the lack of description, his place there is secondary
 brahman granthon main spasht kathan ke dwaara unhen sarvocch pad diya gaya he
 This superiority is also evident from the legend that Vishnu snatched the earth, Veda and Vani from the demons by his three steps and gave it to Indra
 vaidic vishnu ke teen pagon kaa yah brahmanon main kathatmak roopaantaran he; or isi ke saath vishnu kii sarvshereshthata bhi brahman yug main hi spasht ho gayi
 Aitareya Brahmin clearly considers Vishnu as the gatekeeper, the absolute protector of the gods
 rugveda tathaa brahmanon main uplabdh sanketon kaa puraanon main paryaapt parivardhan hua-- kathatmak bhi, vivarnaatmak bhi or vyaakhyaatmak bhi
 The Puranas have referred to Nirmal Parbrahma as Vishnu due to the absence of present, continual, unborn, Akshay, Avayya, Ekras and Hay at the core of this world
 ve 'paraanaa parah', intaraatma main avasthit paramatma, param shreshth tathaa rup, varna aadi nirdeshon tathaa visheshan se rahit hai
 They are devoid of these six vices - birth, growth, result, decay and destruction
 ve sarvatra vyaapt hai or samast vishwa kaa unheen main vaas he; isiilie vidvan unhen 'vasudev' kehete hai
 At a time when there was no day, night, sky, earth, darkness, light and nothing but these, at that time the only head man was Param Brahm, who is not the subject of senses and intellect
 sristi ke armbh main brahma ji ko vishnu ji ne jo mul gyanaswaroop chatupashloki bhagwat sunaaya tha, usamen bhi yahi bhav vyakt hua he -- sristi ke purv keval main hi main tha
 Apart from me, neither was gross nor subtle and neither was the cause of ignorance
 jahaan yah sristi nahin he, vahaan main hi main hoon or is sristi ke rup main jo prathit ho rahaa he, vah bhi main hi hoon or jo kuch batch rahegaa, vah bhi main hi hoon
 In these contexts, the supremacy of Vishnu and the feeling of being a Sarvnarshi is clearly reflected
 mana gaya he ki vishnu ke do rup hue
 The first form is the head man and the second form is 'kaal'
 ye hi donon sristi or pralay ko athwa prakruti or purush ko sanyukt or viyukt karte hai
 This time form God is eternal and eternal; Therefore, the origin, position and catastrophe of the world also never stop
 vaishnavon ke sirmaur tathaa 'puraanon kaa tilak' ke rup main maanya bhagwat mahapurana main sristi kii utpatti ke prasang main kaha gaya he ki sristi karne kii ichha hone par ekarnav main soye vishnu kii naabhi se camel kaa pradurbhaav hua or usamen samast gunon ko abhasith karne vaale swayan vishnu ke hi antaryami rup se pravisht hone se swatah vedamay brahma kaa pradurbhaav hua
 Similarly, in most Puranas, Vishnu has been accepted as the ultimate brahma
 unase sambaddh kathaon se puraana bhare pade hai
 Being a follower, they sometimes have to resort to various traps from the world view
 asuron ke dwaara rajya chin lene par punah swargadhipaty-prapti hetu devataaon ko samudr-manthan kaa paraamarsh dete hue asuron se chal karne kaa suzav dena; tathaa kamoddeepak mohini rup dharankar asuron ko mohit karke devataaon ko amrit pilaanaa; shankhachud ke vadh hetu tulsi kaa satitv bhang karne sambandhi devibhagwat tathaa shivpurana jaise uppuraanon main varnit kathaon main vishnu kaa chal-prapanch drashtavy he
 In this regard, it is important to note that being a follower, they see results
 kinhin varadaanon se asuron / anyaayiyon ke bal-vishisht ho jane ke kaaran yadi chal karke bhi anyaayi kaa ant tathaa anyaay kaa parimarjan hota he to ve chal karne se bhi nahin hichakate
 Killing Bali by hiding in Ramavatar and becoming the MLA of many tricks in the Mahabharata war in Krishnavatar is a reflection of his attitude
 chhidranveshi log inhen kathaon kaa upyog manamaani vyakhya karke ishwar-virodh ke rup main karte hai
 But it is necessary to look at them from the point of view of contextual knowledge, because in the Puranas or related texts, these passages are presented in the opposite situations only for the knowledge of specific duties beyond the ordinary
 dhyatavya he ki puraanon main tathvik gyaan ko hi brahm, paramatma or bhagwaan kaha gaya he
 The entire nature of Vishnu is cognitive
 puraanon main unke dwaara dhaaran kiye jane vaale aabhushanon tathaa ayudhon ko bhi pratikatmak mana gaya he :- In this way, Vishnu carries all the creative ingredients on his body
 vishnu kii akruti se sambandhit stutiparak ek shloke atiprasiddh he :- Shantakaram Bhujagasyanam Padmanabhan Suresham
 vishvadharan gagansadrushan megh varnan shubhangam
 
 lakshmikaantan kamalnayanan yogibhirdhyanagamyam
 Vande Vishnu Bhavabhayaharan Sarvalokakanatham
 
 Charity - whose shape is extremely calm, sleeping on the bed of Sheshnag, with a lotus in the navel, which is also the basis of God and the whole world of the gods, which pervades all the way to the sky, similar to Neelamegh , Extremely beautiful whose whole parts are attained by meditating by yogis, who are masters of entire worlds, who are destroyers of fear of birth and death, such Lakshmipati, a Lnetr God Srivishnu i salute
 vishnu kii sarvshereshthata kaa yah taatpary nahin he ki shiv yaa brahma aadi unase nune hai
 God does not have a high and low sense
 vah to lila main sristi-sanchaalan hetu sagun hone kii praathamikta maatr he
 Therefore, be it Vaishnava or Shaiva - all the best texts like Purana and Mahabharata declare with one voice that God is one
 kaha gaya he ki ek hi bhagavan janardan jagat kii sristi, sthiti or sanhaar ke liye 'brahma', 'vishnu' or 'shiv' -- in teen sangyaaon ko dhaaran karte hai
 There are many clear statements of Vishnu and Shiva being the same
 'avatar' kaa shabdic arth he bhagavan kaa apni swatantry-shakti ke dwaara bhautik jagat main moort rup se aavirbhaav hona, prakat hona
 The accomplishment of an avatar is considered in two conditions - one abandons one's form and eclipses the new form by action; And the second coming in a related form after taking a new birth, in which the condition of a situation in the womb of the mother is also included
 isamen atyalp samay ke liye rup badalakar yaa kisi duusare kaa rup dharankar punah apane rup main aa janaa shaamil nahin hota
 In the well-known seventh and eighth verses of the fourth chapter of Srimad Bhagavad Gita, God himself stated that the purpose of incarnation is that - whenever the loss of religion and the iniquity are uplifted, then for the sacrifice of gentlemen and the destruction of the wicked
 i originate in different eras
 iske atirikt bhagwat mahapurana main ek vishisht or adhik udaatt prayojan kii baat kahi gayi he ki bhagavan to prakruti sambandhi vruddhi-vinaash aadi se pare achintya, anant, nirgun hai
 So if they do not reveal their lila in the form of avatar, then how would the creatures understand their non-living qualities? Therefore, for the inspiring welfare of the creatures, he revealed himself and his leela
 isliye vibhinn avatar-kathaon main kai visham sthitiyaan hai jisase jeev yah samaj sake ki paristhiti ke anusaar uchit maarg kaisaa hota he! The first systematic list of incarnations of Vishnu is available in the Mahabharata
 mahabharat ke shaantiparv main avtaron kii kul sankhya 10 bataayi gayi he :- Swan: Kurmashta Matsyaash pradurbhava Dwijottam॥ varaho narsinghsch vamano ram ev c
 Ramo Dasharthischaiv Satvakat Kalkirev Chak arthath hans kurm matsay varah narsingh vaaman parashuram dasharathanandan ram yaduwanshi shrikrishna tathaa kalki -- ye sab mere avatar hai
 It has further been said that they are all past and future incarnations
 mulpath main varnan chah avtaron kaa he :-1
varah 2
narsingh 3
vaaman 4
parashuram 5
ram 6
krishna Since the Mahabharata is a work made before the birth of Buddha or before the imagery of Buddha being incarnate; So, naturally there is no sign of Buddha anywhere in it
 uske badale hans ko avatar rup main ginaney se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 The description of the avatar in the Dakshinatya text of Mahabharata is as follows: - matsay: kurmo varahashch narsinghsch vaaman:
 Ramo Ramscha Ramsha Krishna: Kalki Cha Te Dash
 yahan purvokt avtaron main se hans ko chhodkar tisare ram arthath balram ko jod dene se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 One thing can be proved from this account that till the time of Mahabharata, no more than ten avatars were imagined; Otherwise those Das avatars would not have been called 'all incarnations of the past and the future'
 baad main anya avtaron kii bhi kalpana prachlit hui or kul avtaron kii gananaa choubees tak pahunch gayin
 Despite counting 22 and 24 avatars in the Bhagavata Mahapuran, the majority of avatars have been the Mahabharata Das
 padmapurana, lingapurana, varahapurana, matsaypurana aadi anek puraanon main samaan rup se dash avtaron kii baat hi bataayi gayi he
 The description of Agnipuran is also exactly the same sequence
 is sandarbh kaa nimnaankit shloke praayah sarvanishtha he :- Matsya: Kurmo Varaashta Narasimhoth Vamana
 raamo ramashch krishnashch buddhah kalkishch te dash
 Thus, only the avatar of Vishnu is recognized
 inke sankshipt vivaran is prakaar hai :- Apart from Dashavatar, the names of fourteen avatars are as follows: - 40 kimi / ghanta chote raaston par Arjun is a third generation main battle tank
 ise bhartiya sena ke liye bharat ke raksha anusandhan evam vikaas sanghathan dwaara viksit kiya gaya he

 Arjuna entered service with the Indian Army in 2004
 tanks ko pehle bhartiya sena ke armard course ke 43 armard regiment main shaamil kiya gaya, jabaki 12 march 2011 ko 75 armard regiment main bhi ise shaamil kiya gaya
 DRDO, as its main experiment with Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment, was tasked to develop a tank
 haalanki tanks kaa vikaas siviaradii dwaara 1972 main shuru hua,par 1996 main bharat sarkaar ne faisla kiya he ki bhartiya aayudh nirmaan factory main is tanks kaa bade paimaane or utpaadan kiya jaye
 When it was first accepted for service in the army, Arjun relied heavily on foreign components and technology
 prarambh main tanks ke ghatakon main se 50% ke kareeb aayaat kiye gaye, jisamen ingine, transmishan, bandook bairal, patariyon, or fire niyantran pranali shaamil the
 However, many of these were later replaced by indigenous systems or supplied by Indian companies
 sena ke sutron se haal hi main tippanee se sanket miltaa he ki roosi tii -90 ke garm mausam main pradarshan ke muddon ke baavjood tanks bhavishya ke bal kaa mukhya aadhaar bane rahenge
 The Arjun project faced severe budget cuts and repeated delays that led to more than 37 years of development
 sarkaar ne may 1974 main praarambhik dizin ke liye ₹155 lakh ko manjuuri di, jabaki 1995 tak, diardio vikaas par badalati jaruraton or mudrasphiti ke kaaran ₹ 3 arab kharch kar chukaa tha

 china main kai aitihaasik rajvansh rahe hai
 Sometimes in their narratives it appears that a dynasty ended in China itself and the new dynasty went ahead and took over the reins of governance
 vastav main aisa nahin tha
 None of the dynasties ended voluntarily
 aksar aisa hota tha ke nayaa rajvansh shuru to ho jaataa tha lekin vah kuch arase tak kam prabhaav rakhata tha or pehle se sthapit rajvansh se ladaaiyaan karata tha

 Its basis is Vedadi scripture, whose number is very large
 ye sab do vibhaagon main vibhakt hai- The Vedas are the oldest Hindu texts
 veda shabd kii utpatti sanskrit ke 'vid' shabd se hui he
 Vid means to know or to acquire knowledge, hence Veda can be called "the book of knowledge
" bhartiya manyata ke anusaar gyaan shaashvat he arthath sristi kii rachana ke purv bhi gyaan tha evam sristi ke vinaash ke pashchaat bhi gyaan hi shesh rah jaayegaa
 Since Vedas came from the mouth of God and Brahma ji heard them, Veda is also called Shruti
 veda sankhya main chaar hai jo hindu dharm ke aadhaar stambh hai
 The creation of two lines of Sanskrit by which any kind of statement is made is called shloka
 praayah shloke chand ke rup main hote hai arthath inamen gati, yeti or lay hoti he
 Being in the form of verses, they are easily remembered
 prachinkaal main gyaan ko lipibaddh karke rakhane kii pratha na hone ke kaaran hi is prakaar kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha
 Although the Vedas reflect the codes of the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda, the Hindus consider the Brahmin texts, the Aranyakas and Upanishads to be Vedas in addition to these codes
 inamen rik aadi samhitayen stuti pradhan hai; brahman granth yajna karm pradhan hai or aaranyak tathaa upanishad gyaan charchaa pradhan hai
 The texts of this category are considered parts of the Vedas

 One department is ritual-related, the other department is knowledge-related

 Every Brahmin book has one or the other Upanishads, but there are also independent Upanishads, which are not part of any Brahmin and are not part of the 'aranyakas'
 kuch upanishad aranyakon main bhi paye jate hai
 There is a description of the subject of Yajna in the Brahmin texts

 yah yahan seemaa kaa kaam karata he or china-nepal seemaa par mukhya himalayan jalsambar vibhajit hokar dono taraf bahata he
 In 1808, the British started the Great Trigonometric Survey of India to determine the highest mountains of the world
 dakshini bharat se shuru kar, survey team uttar kii ore badi, jo vishaal 500 kigra kaa vikonman kaa istemaal karte the jisase sambhavat: sahi maap liya ja sake
 They reached the mountains near the Himalayas in 1830, but Nepal was reluctant to let the British enter the country because Nepal feared political and possible invasion
 sarweyre dwaara kai anurodh kiye gayi par nepal ne saare anurodh thukraa diye
 The British were forced to continue observation from the Terai, an area south of Nepal that is parallel to the Himalayas
 tej barsha or malaria ke kaaran tarai main sthiti bahut kathin thi: teen survey adhikari malaria ke kaaran maare gayi jabaki kharaab swasthya ke kaaran do ko avkaash mil gaya
 Nevertheless, in 1847, the British were compelled and began to observe in detail the Himalayan peaks from the observation station to 240 km
 mausam ne saal ke ant main kaam ko teen mahine tak roke rakhaa
 In November 1847, the British Surveyor General Andrew Waugh of India made a number of observations from the Sawaipur station which is situated at the eastern end of the Himalayas
 us samay kanchanajangha ko vishwa ki sabase unchi chotii maani gai or usne ruchipurvak note kiya ki, is ke peeche bhi lagbhag 230 kimi dur ek chotii he
 Jaune Armstrong, who was a co-officer of Vogue, also saw this peak in the far west from a place he called the peak 'B'
 vaug ne baad main likhaa ki avlokan darshata he ki chotii ‘bi’ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha, lekin avlokan bahut dur se hua tha, satyaapan ke liye najadik se avlokan karnaa jaruri he
 In the coming year, Vogue sent a survey officer to observe peak 'B' in the Terai from the viewpoint, but the clouds stopped all efforts
 san 1849 main vaug ne vah kshetra james nicholson ko saunp diya
 Nicholson produced two observations from Girol 190 km away
 nicholson tab apane saath bada vikonman laayaa or purab kii ore ghuma diya, paanch alag sthanon se nicholson ne chotii ke sabase najadik 174 kimi dur se 30 se bhi adhik avlokan praapt kiye
 Nicholson went back to Patna, the Ganges River, to do some calculations based on his observations
 patna main uske kachche hisaab ne chotii ‘bi’ ki ausat oonchaai 9,200 me diya, lekin yah prakaash apvartan nahin samajha jaataa he, jo oonchaai ko galat bayaan karata he
 The number was clearly shown, although that peak was higher than 'B' Kanchenjunga
 yadhyapi, nicholson ko malaria ho gaya or use ghar laut jane ke liye vivash kiya gaya, hisaab-kitaab khatm nahin ho paaya
 Michael Hennessy, a subsidiary of Vogue, began assigning peaks based on Roman numbers, gave Kanchenjunga the IX name, and Choti 'B' the name XV
 san 1852 may survey kaa kendra dehradun main laayaa gaya, ek bhartiya ganitagya radhanath sikadar or bengal ke surveykshak ne nicholson ke naap par aadhaarit trikoshmetiya hisaab-kitaab kaa prayog kar pehali baar vishwa ke sabase unchi chotii kaa naam ek purv pramukh ke naam par everest diya, satyaapan karne ke liye baar-baar hisaab-kitaab hota rahaa or iskaa karyalayi udghosh, ki XV sabase unchaa he, kai saalon tak let ho gaya
 Vogue started work on Nicholas' data in 1854 and worked with his staff for nearly two years at vast distances over the years of calculations, transactions of light refraction, air pressure, observation
 san 1856 ke march main usne patr ke madhyam se kalakatta main apane pratinidhi ko apni khoj kaa puri tarah se udghosh kar diya
 The height of Kanchenjunga was clearly stated to be 28,156 feet, while the height of XV was stated
 vaug ne XV ke bare main nishkarsh nikaala ki “adhik sambhav he ki yah vishwa main sabase unchaa he”
 The peak XV was calculated to be 29,000 feet high, but it was publicly reported as 29,002 feet
 29,000 ko anumaan lagaakar 'round' kiya gaya he is avadharana se bachane ke liye 2 feet adhik joda diya gaya tha

 In Sanskrit literature, the Natya Shastra of Bharata presents mostly classifications of dramatic characters, and Vatsyayana's Kamasutra reveals distinct distinctions that often relate to the sex trade of men and women
 "agnipurana" main pratham baar nayak-nayika kaa vivechan shringaar ras ke alamban vibhaavon ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Later writers of Sanskrit and Hindi have extended the subject within the boundaries of Shringaaras, accepting the status of "agnipuran"
 in simaaon kaa, jinka atikaraman keval apwaad ke rup main kiya gaya he, is prakaar samajha ja saktaa he: Bharata has made four distinctions of the hero: dheerelit, dheerprantha, dheerodatta, dheerodhata
 ye bhed naatak ke nayak ke hai
 In addition to these, "agnipuran" mentions four more distinctions: sangatha, darshan, shash, dhrishta
 ye bhed spasht hi shringaar ras ke alamban vibhaav ke hai
 Bhoj has mentioned several other classifications in addition to these two in "saraswati Kantabharan" and "shringarprakash"
 kintu unamem se keval ek vargeekaran hi, jiskaa ullekh purush ke bhedon ke rup main bharat ne bhi kiya tha, parvarti lekhakon ko maanya hua : uttam, madhyam, adham
 Bhanudatta gave a new classification to "rasamanjari", which was later considered the principal classification
 yah he : pati, upapati veshik
 Favorable etc
 distinctions were accepted under husband and vice
 bhanudutt ne proshit naam ke ek or bhed kaa ullekh kiya
 Roop Goswami did not accept Vaishik in "ujjwalanilamani"
 unhone krishna ko ekmaatr nayak mana he
 The leading authors of Nayakabhed in Hindi have often accepted the rest, except the first of the above classifications
 pati, upapati, vaishik ko mukhya vargeekaran maanakar anukool, dakshin, shath, ghrishth bhedon ko pati ke antargat rakhaa he 
 Only a few writers in Hindi have accepted the exquisite, medium, unbearable distinction of the hero, among whom Sundar, Cannon and Rasleen are prominent
 nayak ke kuch anya bhed is prakaar hai : proshit, maani, chatur, anbhigya
 Acceptance has two distinctions: metaphorical, virtuous
 chatur ke bhed bhi do hai: vachan chatur, kriya-chatur
 Rasleen has also described the self-styled hero with them
 anbhigya ko bhanudutt ke anukaran par padmakar ne bhi nayakabhas mana he
 Keshav has also considered the protagonist's hidden and light distinction
 rasline ke mat se upapati ke teen tathaa vaishik ke do upbhed hai
 The literature related to the hero-heroine-distinction of Hindi is mostly composed in Reitikal
 nayak-nayika-bhed kii yah kavyasarita do shashakt dhaaraon ke sangam kaa parinaam he
 The first of these is the classical texts on literature and hero-heroine-distinction, which begin with Bharata's "natyashastra"; And the second section is the description of the games of Krishna and the gopis, which flow in the epithets of the Puranas "harivamsa", "padma", "vishnu", "bhagavata" and "brahmavaivatam" and Umapatidhar, Jayadeva, Chandidas, Vidyapati, Meera, Growing up with the melodious eloquence of many devout poets like Narasimha Mehta and Surdas, it has been confirmed by the support of great masters like Nimbark, Vallabh and Chaitanya
 acharyatv kii drushti se kavyashastra ke is ang kii hindi lekhakon kii dein asaadhaaran he
 From the point of view of poetry also, according to the opinion of scholars, such a high level of literature was not produced in such a large quantity of Hindi literature
 bharat ke anusaar nayika ke aath bhed hai : vaasakajja, virahotkanthita, swadhinapatika, kalhantarita, khandita, vipralabdha, proshitabhartrika, abhisarika
 We shall call it circumstantial
 parvarti lekhakon ke anusaar, jise "prakruti-bhed" kaha gaya he, nayika teen prakaar kii hoti he: uttama, madhyamaa, adhama
 The author of "agnipuran" mentions only one classification of the heroine: Swakiya, Parveikaya, Punarbhu, Samanya
 in chaar bhedon main se punarbhu ko aage chalakar manyata praapt nahin hui
 Rudrat and Rudrabhatta presented a hexadex classification, which was given the highest priority by the later writers
 yah vargeekaran is prakaar he : Bhoja has made some fundamental classifications of heroine like hero, but was not accepted by later writers
 bhanudutt ne uparyukt teenon vargikarnon ke atirikt ek nae vargeekaran kaa ullekh kiya he, jise aage chalakar hindi ke adhikansh lekhakon ne sweekaar kiya
 She is,: Heroine: Other Sambhogaddu: Khita, Vyakrottigravita, Manavati

 Originally democracies are made up of a mixture of different principles, but voting is considered to be a characteristic feature of most forms of democracy
 loktantr kii paribhaasha ke anusaar yah "janata dwaara, janata ke liye, janata kaa shashan he"
 But the concept has become somewhat complicated due to the use of different perceptions in different countries and circumstances

 It is difficult to give a completely correct and acceptable definition of democracy
 cranston ne thik hi kaha he ki loktantr ke sambandh main alag-alag dharanaen he
 According to Lancet's definition, "democracy is a political system that provides regular constitutional opportunities for office bearers to change and provides for a mechanism under which a large part of the population receives political charge
" Selecting from the interested contestants influences the decision making
 ” macmmersan ne loktantr ko paribhaashit karte hue ise ‘ek maatr aisa rachanaatantr mana he jisamen sarkaron ko chaynit or praadhikrut kiya jaataa he athwa kisi anya rup main kanoon banaae or nirnay liye jate hai
 According to Schupter, "democratic law is such an institutional system for political decision-making that serves the common interest by selecting the people who are ready to implement the common will of the people
" vastav main, loktantr multah naagarik or raajnneetik swatantraaa ke liye sahabhaagi raajnneeti se sambhddha pranali he
 The following are the main principles regarding the concept of democracy: loktantr kii udaaravaadi parampara main swatantraaa, samanta, adhikaar, dharm nirpekshata or nyaay jaisi avadharanaon kaa pramukh sthaan rahaa he or udaaravaadi chintak aarambh se hi in avadharanaon ko moort rup dene vaali sarvottam pranali ke rup main loktantr kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 Democracy was accepted as a natural political system from the point of view of governing the society after liberation from the natives and feudal lords
 macmmersan kaa kahana he ki paashchaatya jagat main loktantr ke aagaman ke pehle hi chayan kii raajnneeti, pratiyogi rajya vyavastha or market kii rajyavyavastha jaisi avadharanaen viksit ho chuki thim
 In fact in this sense, the liberal state was democratized and not liberalized
 loktantric bhaavana ke aanrabhik chihn thomasmoor or vinstenley jaise angrej vichaarkon or angrej ativishuddhtavaad ke sahitya main paaya ja saktaa he, kintu loktantric bhaavana kii sahi shuruyaat saamaajik sanvida ke siddhanth ke janm ke saath hui, kyonki nagarikon ke saamaajik anubandh kii anternihit bhaavana hi sabhi vyaktiyon kii samanta he
 Thomas Hobbes, in his book 'leviathan' advocating the dominant democratic principle, wrote that government is formed by the people under a social contract
 jon lock kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar janata ke dwaara or usee ke hit ke liye honi chahie
 Adam Smith presented the paradigm of the free market on the democratic basis that every person has the freedom to produce, buy and sell
 prasiddh upyogetavaadi darshanik mil or bentham ne puri tarah loktantr kaa samarthan kiya or upyogetavaad ke madhyam se ise prabhavi bauddhik aadhaar pradaan kiya
 According to him, democracy provides maximum protection to utilitarianism ie maximum happiness of the people, as people expect protection from their rulers and from each other and the best ways to ensure this protection are representative democracy, constitutional government, regular Elections, secret voting, competitive party politics and majority rule
 je
 es
 mil ne bentham dwaara loktantr ke paksh main prastut tark main ek or bindu jodate hue kaha ki loktantr kisi bhi anya shashan-pranali kii tulana main maanavjaati ke naitik vikaas main sarvaadhik yogadan karata he
 In his view, democracy is the supreme medium for moral upliftment and development and expansion of individual capabilities
 is sambandh main yah ullekhya he ki bentham or mil donon main koi bhi saarvbhaum vayask matadhikaar athwa ek vyakti ek mat ke pakshdhar nahin the
 By 1802, Bentham advocated limited suffrage and in 1809 gave the slogan of limited suffrage only to the homeowners of the affluent classes and eventually called for universal suffrage in 1817, but limited this right to men
 isi prakaar mil bhi saarvbhaum vayask matadhikaar ke paksh main nahi tha, kyonki use ashanka thi ki ek varg ke log bahusankhyak hone kii sthiti apana prabhutv kaayam kar sakate he or anya virgon ke hit ke viruddh sirf apane hit ke niyam-kanoon bana sakate hai
 Later in his book 'representative Government' he advocated more than one vote for some but not the non-tax payers, illiterates, insolvents, non-tax payers, ie all those who jointly belong to the working class
 Build, deprived of it
 vah sirf ek aisi pratinidhimulak sarkaar kaa himachati tha jo aadharbhoot samaantaaon main dakhsandaji nahi karti or mukt bazaar or hastkshep kii niti apana kar chalati he
 Later liberal thinkers continued to support democracy and Western Europe and North America worked to further its acceptance
 loktantrke sambandh main puraatan udaaravaadi mat ko samay-samay par anek vichaarkon dwaara chunautiyaan milti rahi hai
 First, questions have been raised on the notion of democracy that everyone knows what is best for them
 lord brice, graham vals ityadi vichaarak maanate hai ki manushya utana vivekshil, tatasth, jaankaar athwa sakriy nahin he jitna ki prajatantr ke sanchaalan ke liye use maan liya jaataa he
 Secondly, democracy rests on the cornerstone of public governance, but it is not easy to clearly state what exactly is the meaning of 'governance' and 'public'
 isliye sarkaar ke aadhaar ke rup main lokmat ek myth he
 Thirdly, democracy is expected to work for the common good, but there can be no such thing as general interest
 kisi bhi samaaj main saamaanya hit vibhinn logon ke liye vibhinn arth rakh saktaa he
 Fourthly, the archaic liberal theory ignores factors such as group psychology, mass oppression and accreditation and genocidal leadership
 panchmatah, loktantr main daleey pranali praayah abhijatya varg kaa khel ban jaati he athwa unke dwaara niyantrit hoti he jo saadhan sampann he or ve hi mahatvapurn muddon par nirnay lete hai
 Again, the policy-making process is also quite complex
 udaarvaadiyon ne anaavashyak rup se ise saral, paardarshee or nyaaysangat maan liya he
 And the biggest error in this theory is that it is based on political equality but economic inequality
 beesvin sadi main raajnneetik vichaarkon ne prashn uthaanaa shuru kiya ki kya jansadharan pratidin ke jivan main raajnneeti main koi bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai? kya saamaanya nagarik, jo apane jivicoparjan main lage rahete hai, raajnneetik bhoomika nibhaane ke liye samay or shakti laga sakate hai? kya jansamooh bina kisi pratibandh ke chunavi loktantr ke madhyam se apni bhaawanaaon kaa khulaa pradarshan karata he to swatantraaa nasht ho jaaegi? in prashnon ke uttar main hi loktantr ke abhijanvaadee or bahulwaadi siddhanth viksit hue hai
 The term eligibility is used for a minority of a group who have special status in the community due to certain factors
 yah alpsankhyak varg samaaj main satta ke vitaran main agrani bhoomika main hota he
 The political class, according to Presthas, consumes far more power in community affairs in proportion to its numbers
 prajatantr ke sabandh main abhijan siddhanth kaa abhyuday dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad hua is siddhanth ke pravarttakon main wilfredo parato, gretanomoska, robert michels or america lekhak james bernhaam tathaa si
 rhite mills pramukh hai
 The main basis of this theory is the belief that there are two types of people in the society - a few specific legs and a large population
 vishisht log hameshaa shikhar tak pahonchte hai kyonki ve sari arhataaon se sampann sarvottam log hote hai
 The elite class, especially the political elite, perform all political acts, monopolize power and enjoy all the benefits associated with power
 bahusankhyak samooh abhijan varg dwaara manamaane dhang se niyantrit or nirdeshit hota he
 The organized minority always governs and directs the unorganized population
 robert michels ne ‘alpatantr ke louh kanoon‘ jaisi ukti kaa prayog karte hue kaha he ki saamaanya virgon ko abhijan varg kii adheenta sweekaar kerani hi chahie kyonki jansankhya kaa ek vishaal bhaag udasin karmanya or swa-shashan main aksham hota he
 The main features of the eligibility principle of democracy are: loktantr ke abhijan siddhanth kaa suvyavasthit pratipaadan sarvapratham joseph shumptor ne apni pustak ‘capitalism, socialism and demokrasi‘ main kiya
 Later Sartori, Robert Dal, Ixtaine, Raymond Aron, Carl Mann Hiemond, Sidney Verba, etc
 supported this view in their works
 loktantr kii yah avadharana is manyata par aadhaarit he ki jansankhya kaa vishaal bhaag aksham or tatasth hota he or vah yogyata or kshamta ke aadhaar par kuch logon kaa chunaav karata he jo raajnneetik dal kaa niyantrit or sanchalit karte hai
 Majority of the people are busy in earning a living
 unhen raajnneetik maamalon main na to abhiruchi hoti he, na samaj
 So they select a few people from the elite and become their followers
 abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aaj ke jatil samaaj main kaaryakshmata ke liye visheshgyata aavashyak he or visheshgyon kii sankhya hameshaa kam hi hoti he
 Therefore, political leadership must be in the hands of such selectively competent people
 yah siddhanth logo kii atisahabhaagita ko bhi khatarnaak maanata he, kyonki taanaashaahee pravriti kaa hitler jaisaa koi taqatvar netaa satta praapt karne ke liye jansamooh ko lamaband kar loktantr ko hi khatm kar de saktaa he jiskaa sidhaa arth he moulik swatantraaaon kaa ant
 Therefore, he claims that in order to preserve democratic and liberal values, it is necessary to keep the masses separate from politics
 abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aam janata ke dwaara vaastavik shashan ho hi nahin saktaa
 Governance is always for the people, never by the people, because the people whom the people choose to represent belong to the elite
 duusare shabdon main loktantr kaa arth he abhijan vargon ke bich pratidwandvita or janata dwaara yah nirnay ki kaunsa abhijan upar shashan karegaa
 Thus, democracy is simply a mechanism by which one of the small groups governs with minimal support from the public
 The elitist theory also believes that the leaders of the elite classes - political parties, leaders, big business houses, voluntary organizations And even a consensus among labor organizations is necessary so that the basic functioning of democracy is non-responsible
 Can be saved and leaders
 isse yah spasht hota he ki bahya taur par to abhijan varg siddhanth loktantr ke vichaar ko adhik vyavahaaravaadi or anubhavik banane kaa daawa karti he, lekin antat yah loktantr ko ek aise roodhiwaadee raajnneetik siddhanth main badal detaa he jo udaaravaadi athwa nav-udaaravaadi yathasthitwaad se santusht ho jaataa he or iske sthayitv ko banaae rakhana chahta he
 Eliteracy has been criticized by many thinkers, including C

 mcpherson, Graeme Duncan, Barry Holden, Robert Dal etc
 are prominent
 is siddhanth ke viruddh mukhya aapattiyaan nimnlikhit hai: The pluralistic principle of democracy also emphasizes the role of groups instead of the common people
 kuch vichaarkon ne loktantr sambandhi aise siddhanton kaa nirupan kiya he jo abhijan siddhanth or bahulwaadi siddhanth kaa mishran he
 But it is also true that the pluralistic theory has its origins as a partial reaction to the elitist theory
 abhijan siddhanth ek aisi sthiti ke nirmaan se santusht he jisamen satta aise abhijanvarg main nihit hoti he jo mahatvapurn nirnay letaa he, lekin bahulwaadi ek aisi pranali par jor detaa he jo udaaravaadi loktantr main abhijanwaad kii pravriti ko nishprabhavi kar degaa or sahi janaakanksha ko prakat karegaa
 The concept of pluralism is old, but it became an important part of modern liberal thinking in the twentieth century

 ucch sthanon par asin logon ke paas purv kii bhaanti satta nahin rah gai he, kyonki ve mukhya rup se paraspar virdohi swaarthon ke bich madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaane lage

 Competition between the big business houses, labor and government has kept each group abusing its power
 is prakaar, nagarikon ke bich sampatti, shiksha or satta main asamanta ko nimna prabhavit kar diya jaataa he kyonki sanghathan or samooh aashaa se adhik pratinidhitiv pradaan karte he or isse loktantr adhik vaastavik banataa he or is arth main adhik vyavhaarya bhi siddh hota he
 Take the example of India
 yahaan mahendra singh tikait kaa kisaan sanghathan or narmada bachaao aandolan aise jan aandolan hai jo lakhon garib or ashikshit logon kii awaz ban jate hai
 And definitely make democracy more real
