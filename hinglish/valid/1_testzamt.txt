 It is also known as the Second War of Kashmir
 bharat or pakistan ke bich jammu or kashmir rajya par adhikaar ke liye bantwaare ke samay se hi vivaad chal rahaa he
 In 1947, the first war between India and Pakistan was also fought for Kashmir

 This campaign was named by Pakistan as Yudhbhiyan Gibraltar

 The war ended with the United Nations declaring a ceasefire and an agreement on both sides in Tashkent

 Like many wars between the two sides, both sides did not reveal many details of this war

 On 20 March 1965, Pakistan deliberately started skirmishes in the Rann of Kutch

 At last General Ayub Khan came under pressure and ordered the covert operation of Operation Gibraltar
 is abhiyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy kashmir kii janata main vidroh bhadakaana or bhartiya sanchartantr evam parivahan vyavastha ko nuksaan pahuchana tha
 The infiltrators of Pakistan were quickly identified and instead of rebelling, the public informed the Indian soldiers and the operation completely failed

 The Indian Army, after receiving information from the local population, crossed the Line of Control on 15 August
 
 In the beginning, the Indian Army had good success

 Pakistan made significant progress in the Tithwal, Uri and Poonch regions, but on August 18, the strength of the Pakistani campaign had decreased significantly

 Not only this, Pakistan's command felt that Muzaffarabad, the important city of Pakistani Kashmir, is now going to be captured by Indians
 mujaffarabad par dabaav kam karne ke liye pakistan ne ek nayaa abhiyaan oparation grand slam shuru kiya
 On 1 September 1965, Pakistan, under an operation called Grand Slam, attacked the strategic city of Akhnoor, Jammu and Kashmir, from a strategic drift
 is abhiyaan kaa uddeshy kashmir ghati kaa shesh bharat se sampark tod tha taaki uski rasad or sanchaar vayvastha bhang kar di jaay
 India was not ready for this invasion of Pakistan and Pakistan was getting the benefit of large number of soldiers and better type of tanks
 shuruwat main bharat ko baari kshati uthaani padi is par bhartiya sena ne hawaii hamale kaa upyog kiya iske jawaab main pakistan ne punjab or srinagar ke hawaii thikaano par hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan was in a very good position during this phase of the war and this unexpected attack caused panic in the Indian camp
 akhnur ke pakistani sena ke haath main jane se bharat ke liye kashmir ghati mehar kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa tha
 There were two reasons for the failure of the Grand Slam
 The first and the biggest reason was that Pakistan's military command changed its military commander at the mouth of the victory, in such a way, the Pakistani army was delayed by a day and those 24 In the hour, India got an opportunity to bring additional troops and goods to protect Akhnoor
 Local commanders of the Indian Army themselves were aghast why Pakistan gave up such an easy victory
 Used to be

 General Chaudhary did not agree with this, but the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri ignored the matter and ordered the attack

 Major General Prasad's convoy was also attacked in this attack and had to leave his vehicle and run away

 This led the Indian Army to attack Lahore air base and as a result the US appealed for a temporary ceasefire to evacuate its citizens from Lahore

 The attack on Lahore on 6 September included the first infantry division of the Indian Army along with three tank squads of the second armored subdivision

 The big officers of the Indian Army did not know the ground situation properly, so they ordered the 3 Jats to retreat, fearing that the 3 Jats had also suffered heavy losses, this caused a lot of disappointment to the command officer of the 3 Jats and later on Dograi Then there was a huge cost to capture
 8 disambar 1965 ko 5 maratha lit infentry kaa ek dasta ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn kasbe munaabaav main tainaat rajasthan sainya bal kly majbootee pradaan karne ke liye bheja gaya
 They were ordered to stop the Pakistani army from advancing but they could only protect their outpost amidst heavy bombardment by the artillery of the Pakistani army and aerial and infantry offensive, 5 Maratha soldiers showed great valor
 As a result, today that outpost is known as Maratha Hill

 The events after 9 September crushed the proud pride of the armies of both the countries

 Pakistan's relatively weak 6 armored division in Chhavinda was defeated badly
 The Indian Army lost about 100 tanks and was forced to retreat

 For their final offensive, Pakistan along with its 1st Armored Division and 11th Infantry Division attacked Khemkaran with the intention of occupying Amritsar

 According to Air Commander Sajjad Haider, who led Pakistan's No
 19 Squadron in the war - although the Indian Air Force vampire fighter aircraft were older and weaker than the F-86 Saber, Hunter aircraft were superior to them both in strength and speed
 bharatiyon ke anusaar F-86 chote se folland nait ke saamne kamazor tha jiske kaaran in vimaanon ko "saibar naashak" kaha jane laga tha
 The Pakistan Air Force's F-104 Starfighter was the fastest flying fighter aircraft in the subcontinent at the time and was often called the "pride of the Pakistan Air Force"

 The Pakistani Air Force claimed that it dropped 104 aircraft from India and lost 19 of its aircraft, while the Indian Air Force claimed that it dropped 73 aircraft from Pakistan and lost 35 of its aircraft

 Pakistan sources have denied claims of losing only one squadron of the Pakistan Air Force, stating that Pakistan had sought additional aircraft from Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and China within 10 days of the initial war

 In the 1965 war, the largest wars of tanks were fought after World War II
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, bharat fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T
H
 Malik
 At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armored cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armored divisions, the 1st and 6th armored divisions - the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armor, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar 
; They were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armored Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, bharat's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians the reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 apni or duusare kii haani ke bare main bharat or pakistan donon ne bilkul bemail daawey kiye
 The brief table of claims of the two countries is as follows There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; Each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy — on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time United Nations intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on US ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, India had the better of the war
 New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 varg mile of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 varg mile of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 The United States and the Soviet Union used important diplomatic equipment to prevent further escalation in conflict between the two South Asian countries

 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, India budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, India reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 December killing one Pakistani Army captain and on 2 February 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 Due to many strategic mistakes made by both India and Pakistan, this war came to a disastrous situation
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defense of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian Army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 " Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani Air Marshal and Commander in Chief of PAF during the war, Noor Khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; The war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan As such, India agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, India was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war - Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, bharat's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, bharat focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, bharat established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy - India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", SM Burke writes - After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote - The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; This result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during the early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defense spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defense spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government advisory
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, India did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, saanchaa:pakistani sena Dhari is a village in the Nainital district of the Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Koshyankutoli tehsil

 Manchester Cricket Club, founded in 1864 as a successor to Old Lancashire, has played at Old Trafford since then and since inception, ie classified as an 'unofficial' first class 1894 enough from 1865 Sources team; ek email client, email pathak yaa adhik aupchaarik rup se mail upyogkarta agent, ek computer kaarykram he jiskaa upyog upyogkarta ke email ko prabandhit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The term can refer to any system capable of accessing a user's email mailbox, a mail user agent, a relaying server, or a human typing on a terminal
 Additionally, a web application that provides message management, structuring, and reception programs is sometimes referred to as an email client, but is commonly referred to as webmail
 lokapriy email clienton main microsoft outluk, pigasus mail, mozila kaa thanderbard or appal ink kaa mail shaamil he
 Like most client programs, an email client remains active when a user runs it
 remote mail sthanantaran agent ke liye sabase aam pranali he, ek upyukt mail vitaran agent kaa upyog karnaa, taaki email sandesh ke aate hi use client ke bhandaaran main jod diya jaae
 duurastha mail bhandaaran upyogkarta ke melbox ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 The default setting on many Unix systems is for storage in the user's home directory, within the formatted message mbox on the remote mail server
 remote sarwar par upyogkarta ke melbox main email jamaa rahata he jabatak ki upyogkarta email client, anurodh kar use apane computer par downlod na kar le yaa anyathaa remote sarwar par upyogkarta ke melbox kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Multiple mailboxes at the same time can set up email clients to contact email and email can be downloaded automatically, at predetermined intervals, or users can request manually
 vaikalpik rup se, upyogkarta remote sarwar mashin par yaa kisi anya sthaan par ek email client ke madhyam se ek email client chalaa sakate hai
 Webmail applications on a remote server can also be run directly on a user's mailbox
 ek upyogkarta ke melbox ko do tarah se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Post office protocol allows the user to download the message at the same time and can be erased from the server only after successfully securing it on local storage
 yah sambhav he ki kisi duusare ke upyog ke liye upyogkarta kii anumati par sandesh ko sarwar par hi chhod diya jaae

 Email clients typically have user interfaces to display and edit text
 kuch anuprayog program-bahya sampadak ke upyog kii anumati bhi dete hai
 Email clients will format according to RFC 5322 for headers and bodies and for mime non-literal tables and attachments
 The header contains the destination fields for To, Cc, and Bcc, and the originator fields from which the message author, the sender if the number of authors is high, and a separate mailbox must be addressed for the response
 For better support with a user destination, most clients are able to connect to one or more address books and / or LDAP directory servers
 pravartak kshetron ke liye, client alag pahchaan ko samarthan de sakate hai
 The client setting requires a list of the user's real name and email address and possibly an LDAP server to identify each user
 jab ek upyogkarta email ko likhnaa or bhejnaa chahta he, email client is kaam ko sambhalate hai
 The email client usually automatically connects to the user's mail server, specifically MSA or MTA, two variations of the SMTP protocol

 mote client email clienton or chote email clienton ke alaava vahaan bhi web aadhaarit email anuprayog bhi hai jise webmel aavedan kaha jaataa he
 Webmail has many advantages, sending and receiving email using the user's normal web browser, therefore eliminating the need for an email client
 kuch website hotmel, jimail, eoel auryahu email sevaaon ke liye samarpit hai; lekin kai internet seva pradaata apane internet ke hisse ke rup main webmel sevaaon ko pradaan karte hai
 The main limitations of Webmail are that users are unable to perform offline conversations, email work or message creation and downloading, although Gmail offers offline Gmail through the installation of Gears
 ek niyamit rup se mail sarwar dwaara pradaan kii gai webmel kaa laabh yah he ki email aadhaar computer par, jab bhi chahen downlod kiya ja saktaa he jab tak mail yuzar mail sarwar par rahata he
 Users can choose whether to be able to leave a copy of the email on the server for a backup
 webmel kaa ek pramukh nuksaan yah he ki hosting nigam yaa sanstha vyakti ke email par niyantran rakhti he jaise ki yah seva kaary ke alaava ek bhandaaran kriya ko bhi barkaraar rakhti he
 Since the hosting and control of the only storage space is controlled by the corporation or organization, the person does not get their email, they can only access it, that too under the control of the corporation or organization
 This becomes a problem when users lose their email accounts through hacking or malice and are unable to get copies of their emails only to be archived again
 webmel internet conection kii gati or gunvattta se bhi prabhavit hota he or dial ap conection upyogkarta ke liye ek samasya ho sakati he
 a major advantage of webmail is that it makes a person's email available wherever there is an internet connection and a browser and there is no need to install the application in their mail in that person's computer
 webmel ke saath upyogkarta ke email aamtaur par ekaadhik atirek ke saath samarthit hote hai or nigam or sansthaaen aamtaur par atyant vishwasaneey seva or saath hi utkrisht spam filtering sevaayen pradaan karti hai
 Corporations store huge amounts of personal information concerning the privacy of webmail
 jabaki mail ko pun: praapt karne ke liye lokapriy protocol POP3 or IMAP4 hai, aamtaur par mail bhejne ke liye SMTP protocol kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Another important email client is MIME which is supported by most standards which is used to send binary file email attachments
 anulgnak fil uchit email kaa hissaa nahin hai, lekin yah email ke saath bheja jaataa he
 Most email clients use the x-mailer header field to send software identification messages

 hindko shabd kaise bana iske bare main kai vichaar prachlit hai
 The initial people coming to India from Asia and Iran established contact with this dialect after crossing the Hindukush mountain
 kyunki hindukush ko paar karne ke baad hindustan ke raste main koi khaas rukaawat nahin thi isi liye is boli ko hindustan kii boli yaa hindko kaha gaya
 The Greek people have used the word Indicos for Hindustan and that is why the dialect here is called Hindco
 kuch logon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki yah naam ise iraneeyon ne diya
 This language was spoken in the middle or front of the mountains of Sindh valley

 parinaam Political science is a social science which deals with the study of government and politics
 raajnneeti vigyaan adhyayan kaa ek vistrut vishay yaa kshetra he
 Political science includes all these things: political thought, political theory, political philosophy, political ideology, institutional or structural framework, comparative politics, public administration, international law and organization etc
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa udbhav atyant pracheen he
 The Greek thinker Aristotle is called the father of political science
 unani chintan main plato kaa adarshavaad evam arestu kaa buddhivaad samahit he
 Political science or political science is a very ancient subject
 prarambh main ise swatantra vishay ke rup main nahin sweekaara gaya
 There was a tradition of studying political science based on the concepts of ethics, philosophy, history, and jurisprudence etc
 aadhunik samay main ise na keval swatantra vishay ke rup main sweekaara gaya apitu saamaajik vigyaanon ke sandarbhon main iskaa paryaapt vikaas bhi hua
 While studying political science is more important in today's context than before, on the other hand it is also very complex
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa mahatv is tathy se prakat hota he ki aaj raajnneetik prakriya kaa adhyayan rashtriya evam anterrashtriya-donon prakaar kii raajnneeti ko samajhane ke liye aavashyak he
 Knowledge of real politics and facts located within them is possible only through the study of the process
 raajnneeti vigyaan kii jatilta unke ativyapee rup va unase utpann swaroop evam prakruti se judi hui he
 Today political science deals with both 'political' and non-political elements
 raajnneetik tatv pratyaksh rup se raajnneetik prakriya ko sanchalit karte he or is drushti se raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat rajya sarkaar, sarkari sansthaaon, chunaav pranali va raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Non-political elements indirectly contribute to the running of the political process and for this reason a correct understanding of politics can only be achieved by coordinating them
 isi uddheshy se raajnneetik adhyayan main samaaj, arthvyavastha, dharm, samskruti, bhugol, vigyaan va takneekee, manovigyaan va itihaas jaise sahyogi tatwon ko paryaapt mahatv diya jaataa he
 Political science forms, study materials and its traditions have changed from time to time with contributions from various thinkers, theorists and analysts from the time of the Greek thinkers to the modern period
 tadnurup is vishay kaa nirantar vikaas hota rahaa hai
 In this development, two major approaches have emerged regarding the study of political science: the traditional approach and the modern approach
 parmparik yaa paramparaagat drushtikon rajya-pradhanta kaa parichay detaa he jabaki aadhunik drushtikon prakriya-pradhanta kaa
 The political approach that has been prevalent in the sixth century BC to the 20th century, almost before the Second World War, is called 'traditional political approach' in terms of study facility
 ise adarshavaadi yaa shastreey drushtikon bhi kaha jaataa he
 Many political thinkers have contributed to the formulation and development of traditional political theory such as Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Saint Augustine, Aquinas, Locke, Rousseau, Montescue, Kant, Heigl, Green, etc
 aadhunik yug main bhi anek vidwaan paramparaagat drushtikon ke samarthak maane jate he jaise- liyo strans, erik vogolin, oksot, hanna arent aadi
 In ancient Greece and Rome, the concepts of philosophy, ethics, logic, history and law were made the basis for the creation of political theory, but in the medieval period, mainly Christian theological perspectives were made the basis of political theory
 16veen sadi main punarjagran aandolan ne bauddhik raajnneetik chetana ko janm diya saath hi raashtra-rajya avadharana ko janm diya
 The Industrial Revolution of the 18th century gave a new impetus to the development of political theory
 england kii gauravpurn kranti, france va america kii loktantric krantiyon ne paramparaagat raajnneetik siddhanth kaa vikaas ’udaaravaadi loktantric raajnneetik siddhant’ ke rup main kiya
 The traditional political approach has adopted philosophical, logical, moral, historical and legal methods mainly for the formulation of political theory
 19veen sadi se isane vidhik, sanvaidhanik, sansthagat, vivarnaatmak evam tulanaatmak paddatiyon par vishesh bal diya he
 From the beginning of the 20th century, the traditional approach adopted a new vision for the formulation of political theory which was more realistic than in the past
 paramparaagat raajnneetik vigyaan main sarkaar evam uske vaidhanik angon ke baahar vyavhaar main sarkaar kii nitiyon evam nirnyon ko prabhavit karne vaale saamaajik raajnneetik tathyon ke adhyayan par bal diya
 The political party emphasized the study of formal organizations, along with the groups of evidences
 isane un saamaajik, aarthik paristhitiyon evam aandolanon ke adhyayan par bhi bal diya jo spashtatah sarkaar ke aupchaarik sanghathan se baahar to hote hai kintu uski nitiyon evam kaaryakramon ko prabhavit karte hai
 The synonym of 'politics' is the English word 'politics' from the Greek word 'polis' which means 'city' or 'state'
 pracheen yunaan main prayek nagar ek swatantra rajya ke rup main sangathit hota tha or politics shabd se un nagar rajyon se sambandhit shashan kii vidya kaa bodh hota tha
 Gradually, the city states were replaced by the national states, so politics also became a widely related discipline of the state
 aadhunik yug main jab sansar prayek vishay ke vaigyanik va vyavasthit adhyayan kii ore jhuk rahaa he, rajya se sambandhit vishyon kaa adhyayan raajnneeti shaastra athwa raajnneeti vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 Traditional political science scholars have given different definitions of political science
 in paribhaashaon kii nimnaankit sheershakon ke antargat vyakhya kii ja sakati haih- Political science is the study of the state - Many political scientists believe that since ancient times, political science is the subject of the study of an institution called the state
 vidwaanon kii manyata he ki pracheen kaal se aadhunik kaal tak raajnneeti vigyaan kaa ’kendriya tatv’ rajya hi rahaa he
 Therefore, the state should be studied only in political science
 prasiddh raajnneetishastri bluenshali ke anusaar raajnneeti shaastra vah vigyaan he jiskaa sambandh rajya se he or jo yah samajhane kaa praytn karata he ki rajya ke aadharbhoot tatv kya he, uskaa aavashyak swaroop kya he, uski kin-kin vividh roopon main abhivyakti hoti he tathaa uskaa vikaas kaise hua
 The German writer Garris states that in political science, as an institution of power, all the relations of the state, its origin, its tangible form, its purpose, its moral importance, its economic problems, its stages of existence, its financial aspects, The purpose is considered
 doctor garnor ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti shaastra kaa prarambh tathaa ant rajya ke saath hota he
 "dr
 Zakaria states that" Political science systematically represents the basic principles according to which the organization of the state in the macro form and sovereignty is exercised
 ’ It is clear from all the above definitions that the central subject of political science is the state
 iskaa kaaran plato va arestu ke samay se chali aa rahi yah manyata he ki rajya kaa astitv kuch pavitra lakshyon kii prapti ke liye he
 Political science is the study of government - in the opinion of some political scientists, government should be studied in political science, not the state
 unka mat he ki rajya manushyon kaa hi sanghathan vishesh he tathaa uski kriyaatmak abhivyakti sarkaar ke madhyam se hoti he
 He argues that the state is an intangible structure whereas the government is a tangible and direct institution and the government exercises sovereignty
 sarkaar hi rajya kaa vah yantra hota he jiske dwaara uske uddeshy tathaa prayojan kaaryrup main parinit hote hai
 Therefore, government should study only in political science
 seale ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti vigyaan shashan ke tatwon kaa anusandhan usee prakaar karata he jaise sampatti shaastra sampatti kaa, jeevigyaan jivan kaa, ankaganit ankon kaa tathaa rekhganit sthaan evam lambaai-chaudaai kaa karata he
 "leacock has given a concise and concise definition in this context -" Political science is the scripture related to government
 ’’ Political science is the study of both the state and the government - some scholars of traditional political science believe that the definitions given from the point of view of the state or government alone are incomplete
 vastutah rajya evam sarkaar kaa paraspar ghanishtha sambandh he or inamen se kisi ek ke abhaav main duusare kaa adhyayan hi nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 If the state is an intangible structure, then the government gives it a tangible and physical form and similarly if the state is to hold sovereignty then the government consumes that sovereignty
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat in donon kaa hi adhyayan kiya janaa chaiye
 According to Paul Janet, "political science is that part of social sciences in which the basis of the state and the principles of government are considered
 ’’ dymock ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan kaa sambandh rajya tathaa uske saadhan sarkaar se he
 While giving a short definition, Gilchrist has said that "political science studies the common problems of the state and the government
" ’’ Political science is the study in terms of the human element - some political scientists do not consider the above definitions to be absolute because the human element is ignored in these definitions
 inaki manyata he ki rajya yaa sarkaar kaa adhyayan bina maanav ke uddeshyheen evam mahatvaheen he kyonki inkaa nirmaan maanav ke hit ke liye hi hua he atah maanav-tatv kaa adhyayan anivaary he
 According to Professor Laski, "the study of political science is related to the life of human beings belonging to organized states
" ’’ raajnneeti shaastra ke prasang main maanav tatv kaa mahatv vyakt karte huye encychlopedia of soshal sinsej main harman hiler ne to yahan tak kaha he ki ’’raajnneeti shaastra ke sarvangin swaroop kaa nirdhaaran uski manushya vishyak moulik manyataon dwaara hota he
 "it literally means that political science is such a social science under which the fact is also studied what is the position of man himself in an organized political society
 raajnneeti vigyaan vyakti ke adhikaar va swatantrataaon ke adhyayan ke saath samaaj ke vibhinn samudaayon va virgon ke prati sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 Therefore, we can define political science as a scripture which is related to the organization called its state and which includes a detailed study of government by nature, in short, under political science the state, government and other related organizations and institutions Ka is studied in the context of human political life
 raajnneeti vigyaan se sambandhit paramparaagat paribhaashayen nimna pravritiyaan ingit karti he- Just as political science has been defined by different thinkers in different ways, different fields have been expressed by different authors in different words
 udaahranarth francisi vichaarak bluenshali ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti vigyaan kaa sambandh rajya ke aadhaaron se he vah uski aavashyak prakruti, uske vividh roopon, uski abhivyakti tathaa uske vikaas kaa adhyayan karata he
 "according to Dr
 Garner," its fundamental problems usually include the research of the origin and nature of the first state, the progress of the second political institutions, the study of its history and its forms, and the third, as far as possible, on the basis of political And determining the rules of development
 gaetel ne raajnneeti shaastra ke kshetra kaa vistrut varnan kartehuye likhaa he ki ‘‘aitihaasik drushti se raajnneeti shaastra rajya kii utpatti, raajnneetik sansthaaon ke vikaas tathaa ateet ke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karata he
 


 In studying the present, it tries to describe, compare and classify the existing political institutions and ideologies
 parivartansheel paristhitiyon tathaa naitik maapdandon ke aadhaar par raajnneetik sansthaaon tathaa kriyakalapon ko adhik unnat banane ke uddheshy se raajnneeti shaastra bhavishya kii ore bhi dekhtaa hua yah bhi vichaar karata he ki rajya kaisaa hona chaiye
 '' raajnneeti shaastra ke kshetra ke vishay main uparokt paribhaashaon se teen vichaardhaaraen saamne aati he- To determine the field of traditional political science, UNESCO organized a conference of leading political scientists of the world in September 1948, in which it was decided to include the following study topics under the field of traditional political science- raajnneeti ke siddhanth- ateet or vartmaan ke raajnneetik siddhanton evam vichaaron kaa adhyayan
 Political Institutions - Simple and comparative study of constitution, national government, territorial and local governance
 raajnneetik dal, samooh evam lokmat- raajnneetik dal evam dabaab samoohon kaa raajnneetik vyavhaar, lokmat tathaa shashan main nagarikon ke bhaag lene kii prakriya kaa adhyayan
 International Relations - Study of International Politics, International Law, International Organization and International Administration
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan darshan evam kalpana par aadhaarit he
 Traditionalist thinkers have mostly been influenced by philosophy
 in vichaarkon ne maanviya jivan ke mulyon par dhyaan diya hai
 Their system of thinking is deductive
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan main plato kaa vishesh mahatv he
 In addition to Plato, the thought of the Roman thinker Cicero and Saint Augustine in the medieval period gives a clear glimpse of traditional political science
 aadhunik yug main paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke prabal samarthako kii kaaphi sankhya he
 The compositions of Russo, Kant, Hegel, Green, Bossanke, Laski, Oakshott and Leostras have a clear glimpse into Plato's ideas
 aadhunik kaal main paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan kii adhyayan saamagree evam rajya sambandhi dharanon kii katu aalochana hui he
 According to critics, some processes and an environment are seen beyond the periphery of the state and political institutions, neglecting the study of which is disastrous for the dignity and utility of political science
 is mat ke prativadak yah maanate he ki sabhi samaaj vigyaanon kii prerana strot va adhyayan kaa kendra bindu maanav-vyavhaar he or raajnneeti vigyaan saamanytah maanav vyavhaar ke raajnneetik pahalu kaa adhyayan he
 Prior to the Second World War, certain political thinkers were insistent on giving a major place to the political processes and activities of human beings in the study of political science
 balter vaijahot, woodro wilson, lard brice aadi ne raajnneeti ke yathartwaadee adhyayan par bal diya
 Graham Wallas, Arthur Bentley, Caitlin and Lasvalle emphasized the study of humans and their behavior
 charles marium ne 1925 kii amareeki raajnneeti vigyaan eshosiation ke sammelan main raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan ke liye vaigyanik takneekon evam pravidhiyon ke vikaas evam prayog par bal diya
 In 1930 Laswell, in his book psycho-pathology and Politics, laid the foundation for Fried's psychology to explain political events and actions
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke purv america kaa chicago vishvavidhyalay vyavahaaravaadi raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kaaryakshetra ban chukaa tha
 The development of the Second World War has special significance in the development process from traditional political science to modern political science, after which the world was very different from the former world in terms of political structure, industrial development, scientific and technological achievements and military capability
 vishwastar par huye is gambhir parivartan ne maanav samaaj va samskruti kii paramparaagat avadharanaon ke sthaan par nai avadharanaon ko janm diya
 In this environment after the Second World War, Charles Mariam fully supported the use of new and scientific techniques for the study of political science in his work 'new Aspect of Politics'
 uparokt prishthbhumi main 1960 ke dashak main america ke chicago vishvavidhyalay ke raajnneetishastriyon ne raajnneeti vigyaan ko darshanik paddati se mukt karne evam uske adhyayan ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane kaa praytn kiya
 It is considered appropriate to adopt the scientific methods of social sciences such as sociology, psychology, economics, anthropology, to make political science a social science
 in vaigyanikon main david easton, ketalin, lasvail aadi pramukh he
 George Caitlin, David Easton, Harald Lasvall and Kaplan are particularly notable in terms of modern concepts of political science
 in vidwaanon ne raajnneeti vigyaan sambandhi apane kathyon main raajnneeti ke vaastavik evam vyaavhaarik sandarbhon par bal dete huye use shakti, prabhaav, raajnneetik auchity evam satta kaa adhyayan mana he
 The ideas about political science presented by political scientists who are advocates of the modern approach can be explained under the following points- raajnneeti vigyaan maanav kriyaaon kaa adhyayan he- raajnneeti vigyaan ke aadhunik drushtikon ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar evam kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Non-political factors also influence human behavior
 in sabhi karkon kaa raajnneeti vigyaan main adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 a
 Heard and S
 Huntington's statement that "political pragmatism accepts governance as a process of actions for humans and their communities
" hasjaar va stivension kaa yah vichaar he ki ’’raajnneeti vigyaan apane adhyayan kshetra main praathmik rup main vyaktiyon ke parsparik va samuhik tathaa rajya evam rajyon ke madhya prakat shakti sambandhon se sambandhit he
 Political science is the study of power - Caitlin and Lasvalle are supporters of this idea
 donon ke vivechan kaa mukhya aadhaar manovigyaan he
 In 1927–28, Caitlin emphasized the study of the political activity of man in place of state, describing politics as a struggle for dominance and control
 uske matanusaar sangharsh kaa mul strot maanav kii yah ichha rahi he ki duusare log uskaa astitv maane
 In 1962, Caitlin wrote in her book Systematic Politics - Political science is the most concerned about the work that is done due to the sense of control and the structure and desires that are created due to the desires of relationships based on the feeling of control
 anya shaktivaadee vichaarak lasvail kii manyata he ki samaaj main katipay mulyon va moolyawaan vyaktiyon kii prapti ke liye har vyakti apana prabhaav daalane kii cheshtaa karata hai tathaa prabhavacheshtaa main shakti bhav nihit rahata he
 Therefore, according to Laswell, 'politics is the politics that is intended to tell who gets what, what, when and how
 ' uske anusaar raajnneetik kriyalap kaa prarambh us paristhiti se hota he jisamen karta vibhinn mulyon kii prapti ke liye praytn karata he tathaa shakti jisaki aavashyak shart hoti he
 Political science is the study of the polities - the supporters of this view are David Easton, Amand, R
V
 Kegan etc
 yah drushtikon raajnneeti vigyaan ko samajashastreey drushtikon main paribhaashit karata hai
 They believe that the whole society is a system in itself and the state system is a sub-system of this entire social system and it forms an integral part of it
 rajya vyavastha main anek kriyasheel sanrachanaae hoti hai jaise samvidhan sarkaar ke ang, raajnneetik dal, dabaab samooh, lokmat evam nirvachan evam maanav-vyavvhaar is vyavastha kaa abhinn bhaag he
 In short, these scholars believe that political science studies the interactions and relations of these structures of the political system and the political behavior of human beings as part of the entire social system
 raajnneeti vigyaan rajvyavastha ke adhyayan ke antargat nimna tathyon par adhik bal detaa he -sampurna samaaj vyavastha ke ang ke rup main raajnneetik prakriya kaa adhyayan, vyavastha kisanrachana evam samoohon ke parsparik sambandhon kaa adhyayan
 Political science is the study of decision process - Political scientists who are supportive of this view believe that while studying government, political science also studies the decision-making process of government or science in the context of the prevailing conditions in society or state
 is kaaran raajnneeti vigyaan aisa vigyaan he jo kisi shashan kii niti-prakriya evam uske dwaara niti nirmaan kaa adhyayan karata he visheshkar in donon ko prabhavit karne vaale karkon ke sandarbh main, is drushtikon kii manyata he ki maanav prakruti ke sandarbh main sarkaar dwaara niti nirmaan-prakriya kaa kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 In real political life, the decision making in the name of governance is done by the individual himself and hence the decision making process has a wide influence on the decision makers personality, interest culture, religion, political ideology, mental level decision making power etc
 atah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik drushtikon ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan manushya ke saamaajik raajnneetik jivan kaa adhyayan karata he
 Under this, along with political processes, political organizations are also studied
 pinok evam smith ke anusaar kya he tathaa kya hona chaiye or in donon ke bich yathasambhav samanvay kaise praapt kiya jaye, is drushti se ham sarkaar tathaa raajnneetik prakriya ke vyavasthit adhyayan ko raajnneeti vigyaan kehete he
 The field of political science is highly developed in the modern era
 shakti va prabhaav ke sandarbh main raajnneeti kii sarvavyaapaktaa ne use har taraf pahunchaa diya he or na keval saamaajik balki vyakgit jivan ke bhi lagbhag sabhi paksh raajnneetik vyavastha ke adheen he
 While the ubiquity of politics has proved the folk religion of political interpretations on the one hand, it has also created ambiguity and confusion regarding what is political
 iske baavjood raajnneetik vigyaan ke kshetra ko rajyapradhan va rajetar sandarbhon main bhaleebhanti samajha ja saktaa he
 In the state context, political concepts and concepts related to the state's concepts - socialism, democracy etc
, government or organization constitution described and actual behavior, mutual relations of government positions and institutions, organizational and experimental aspects of election, administrative and judiciary and interpretation of the state, Principles of origin, state functionality, state-wide ideologies Freedom, equality, rights etc

 The principles and methods of representation can also be understood in this context
 raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan kshetra ke bare main aadhunik drushtikon kii kuch aadharbhoot manyataain hai jaise- adhyayan kshetra ke nirdhaaran main yatharthparak drushtikon apnaanaa, raajnneetik vigyaan kii vishay vastu ko antar-anushaasanamak drushtikon ke antargat samajha jaye, raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main vaigyanik paddati va upagamon ko prayog main laayaa jaye
 According to the modern view, the area of political science can be explained under the following points: maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan- aadhunik drushtikon maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar ke adhyayan par bal detaa he
 Although it affects the human behavior but also studies the non-political elements, it is recognized that to understand human behavior in real terms, the study of all the non-political feelings, beliefs and powers should be included which can affect the political behavior of human beings
 Affect vibhinn avadharanaon kaa adhyayan - aadhunik raajnneeti vigyaan mukhyatah shakti, prabhaav, satta, niyantran, nirnay prakriya aadi kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karata he
 According to this view, these are concepts whose political institutions work in the background only
 raajnneetishastri inhen avadharanaon ke pariprekshya main raajnneetik sansthaaon kaa adhyayan karte he
 For this reason, this type of study has been called informal study of the truth
 raajnneeti vigyaan samasyaon evam sangharshon kaa adhyayan - aadhunik raajnneetishastri yatha professor daayak evam peter orgard raajnneeti shaastra ko saarvajanik samasyaon va sangharshon kaa adhyayan kshetra main shaamil karte he
 In their opinion, tension and politics start due to problems of their distribution due to limited values and means
 vah raajnneetik dalon ke atirikt vibhinn vyaktiyon va samoohon main tak main fail jaati hai
 Professor Dyck called politics the politics of conflict of characters with conflicting desires over public problems
 peter origuard kii manyata he ki is sangharsh main raajnneeti ke alaava anya bahyatatvon kaa niyantran nahin hona chaiye
 Study of Public Consent and General Opinion - In the opinion of some scholars, political science is the study of consensus and general opinion on public problems
 unke vichaar main sangharsh sangharsh ke liye hi nahin varan saamaanya sahmati va saamaanya abhimath ko prabhavit karne ke liye hota he
 That is why Edward Weinfield has said that 'activities that make any issue conflict or resolve are part of all politics
 ’’ From the above analysis it is clear that despite the differences in the field of political science in the modern approach, there is agreement on some basics, such as everyone recognizes that the study area of political science is realistic, its study is inter-disciplinary
 Approach and scientific method should be used
 haalanki yah satya he ki aadhunik raajnneetishastriyon kaa raajnneeti vigyaan main vaigyanik pramanikta va sunishchitata kaa daawa abhi purna nahin hua he
 For this reason, Pinock and Smith, while accepting some modifications in the modern approach, have given a proper place in the study of political science, along with the study of practical politics, as well as the organizational and fundamental study of political institutions
 arastu ke anusaar manushya ek saamaajik praani he
 All the dimensions of social life fulfill his lifestyle
 maanak jivan kii dhuree par in ayaamon ke sabhi niamak vishay paraspar judakar satat parichaalit he
 Politics does the important work of coordinating all these dimensions
 raajnneeti vigyaan evam anya saamaajik vigyaanon kii ghanishthata ke kaaran hi raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main pracheen kaal se antar-anushaasanamak adhyayan kii parampara rahi he
 In the works of ancient Greek thinker Plato, Aristotle, the intimacy of politics is evident from philosophy and ethics
 madhyayugin vichaarak saint augustin va thomas equinas kii rachanaaon main dharamshastra va nitishastra ke saath raajnneeti kii ghanishthata prakat hoti he
 Scholar Maciaev of the early 16th century ie modern era Lee used history in its ideological basis
 uske baad habs ne jyamiti, yantriki tathaa chikitsavigyaan ke tathyon va siddhanton kaa upyog kiya
 Rousseau and Montescue explained the closeness of politics and geography
 18veen sadi ke uttararddh va 19veen sadi ke praarambhik kaal main raajnneeti vigyaan va anya samaaj vigyaanon ke bich ghanishtha sambandh swikaarne main baadha aayi kyonki is kaal main vibhinn vigyaanon dwaara apane ko purna evam swatantra vigyaan maanane par bal diya gaya
 But from the middle of the 19th century, again the fact began to be accepted that all social sciences have close relations
 karl marks evam august kamte ne saamaajik vigyaanon kii ghanishthata par bal diya
 With the beginning of the 20th century, political science's intimacy with other sciences was often unquestionably accepted

 Therefore, all sociology are related among themselves and the method of interstructural study has again raised this relation of sociology

 Quarks are the fundamental components of hadrons and their interactions are strong interactions
 gyaat aaweshit kanon main keval quark hi aise kan hai jinpar aavesh kaa maan bhinnaatmak hota he lekin wo swatantra avasthaa main nahin paye jate or teen kaa samooh athwa do ke samooh ke rup main paye jate hai
 Therefore, only integer charge can be observed in nature
 inke pratikan prati-quark hote hai jo keval aavesh ke rinatmak maan ke rup main inase bhinn hote hai
 So far observed particles have six different types of quarks, three of which are positively charged, while the charge on the other three is negative
 leptone prabal anyonya kriya main bhaag nahin lete
 Their antagonists are per-leptons whose lepton number and charge are opposite
 electron ke pratikan ko aitihaasik kaarnon se pojitron kehete hai
 According to the standard model of particle physics, there are a total of six types of leptons, three of which are charged leptons called electron-like leptons and the other three leptons are chargeless called neutrinos
 boson moolbhoot kanon ke prakaar main ek tarah ke kan hai jo fermionon se bhinn hai
 Bosons are called particles that follow the Bose – Einstein statistic and have integer rotation
 boson mulkan ho sakate hai jaise: photone, gluon aadi athwa sammishra kan jaise meson
 All fundamental forces of nature are governed by gauge bosons and the mass is assumed to be produced by the Higgs field
 maanak model ke anusaar mul boson nimna hai: According to ultra-symmetric theories, there are some other particles also, not one of which was observed till 2014: Note: Just as the photon, z boson and W± bosons are superpositions of the B0, W0, W1, and W2 fields – the photino, zino, and wino± are superpositions of the bino0, wino0, wino1, and wino2 by definition
no matter if one uses the original gauginos or this superpositions as a basis, the only predicted physical particles are neutrlinores or charginous as a superposition of them together with the Higgsinos
 Other theories predict the existence of additional bosons: Mirror particles are predicted by theories that restore parity symmetry
 Magnetic monopole is a generic name for particles with non-zero magnetic charge
 They are predicted by some guts
 Tachyon is a generic name for hypothetical particles that travel faster than the speed of light and have an imaginary rest mass
 Preons were suggested as subparticles of quarks and leptons, but modern collider experiments have all but ruled out their existence
 kaluza–klein towers of particles are predicted by some models of extra dimensions
 The extra-dimensional momentum is manifested as extra mass in four-dimensional spacetime

 The characters of Mirza Sajjad Ali and Mir Roshan Ali portray the paranoid mentality of Prabhuvarga
 lakhanu par angreji sena kaa kabja ho gaya
 Wajid Alishah was imprisoned
 mir or mirza isse pareshaan nahin hote kintu shatranj khelte hue apni jaan de dete hai
 In this story Premchand portrays Lucknow of Wajidali Shah's time

 Every moment they feel that the next bet is theirs
 ant main tang aakar miraza kii begum un donon ko khari-khoti sunaati hai
 The whole game throws it out of the deodorant
 nateeja yah nikalataa he ki shatranj kii baaji ab miraza ke yahan se uthakar mir ke daravaaje ja baithti he
 In the beginning, Mir Sahab's wife does not say anything, but when the matter starts to move forward, then she devises a unique trick to beat these two players
 jaisaa ki hameshaa hota tha, donon mitra shatranj kii baaziyon main khoye hue the ki usee samay baadashahi fouj kaa ek acefasar mir sahab kaa naam poochta hua aa khadaa hota he
 Mir Sahib's senses flew as soon as he saw him
 vah shahi afasar mir sahab ke naukaron par khub rob gaalib karata he or mir ke na hone kii baat sunakar agle din aane kii baat karata he
 Thus ends this spectacle
 donon mitra chintit hai, iskaa kya samaadhaan nikaala jaay
 Mir and Mirza were also not small players
 unhone bhi gazab kii tod nikaali
 Both friends once again considered their next stop by relocation
 na honge, na mulaakaat hogi
 Here Begum became free, and Mir was careless
 nayaa sthaan tha shahar se dur, gomti ke kinare ek viraan maszid
 There was absolutely no movement of people there

 This went on for a few days
 ek din achaanak mir sahab ne dekha ki angreji fouj gomti ke kinare-kinare chali aa rahi he
 He told this thing in a hurry to Mirza
 miraza ne kaha - tum apni chaal bachaao
 The British are coming and let them come
 mir ne kaha saath main topakhana bhi he
 Mirza saheb said- give this hoax to someone else
 is prakaar punah donon khel main gum ho gaye

 Both Mir and Roshan were the vassals of this Nawab
 nawab kii raksha main inhen apni jaan kii baaji laga deni chahie
 But unfortunately, he put his bet on the chess bet
 thodi hi der baad khel kii baaji main ye donon mitra ulajh pade
 The matter reached the family and the REC
 gaali-galouj hone lagi
 Both held daggers and swords
 donon ne talavaarein nikaalin or ek duusare ko de maarin
 Both came to an end
 kaash! yah maut nawab vaajibili ke paksh main or british sena ke pratipaksh main hui hoti! lekin aisa hua nahin

 manusmriti hindu dharm kaa ek pracheen dharamshastra he
 It is also known by the names Manav dharma-shastra, Manushahita etc
 yah upadesh ke rup main he jo manu dwaara rishiyon ko diya gaya
 Subsequent theologians have followed Manusmriti as a reference
 dharamshastreey granthkaaron ke atirikt shankaracharya, shabaraswami jaise darshanik bhi pramanroopen is granth ko uddhrut karte hai
 Traditionally, this memory is composed by Swayambhuva Manu, not by Vaivasvata Manu or oriental Manu
 manusmriti se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki swyambhuv manu ke mulashastra kaa aashray kar bhrigu ne us smriti kaa upavrihan kiya tha, jo prachlit manusmriti ke naam se prasiddh he
 Like this 'bhargaviya Manusmriti', 'nardiya Manusmriti' is also popular
 manusmriti vah dharamshastra he jisaki manyata jagavikhyath he
 Decisions have been made on the basis of its evidence not only in India but also in foreign countries and even today
 atah dharamshastra ke rup main manusmriti ko vishwa kii amuly nidhi mana jaataa he
 After the Vedas in India, 'manusmriti' is the most recognized and practiced
 isamen chaaron varnon, chaaron ashramon, solah sanskaron tathaa sristi utpatti ke atirikt rajya kii vyavastha, raja ke kartavya, bhaanti-bhaanti ke vivaadon, sena kaa prabandh aadi un sabhi vishyon par paraamarsh diya gaya he jo ki maanav maatr ke jivan main ghatit hone sambhav he
 All this religious system is based on the Veda
 manu maharaj ke jivan or unke rachanakaal ke vishay main itihaas-puraana spasht nahin hai
 However, everyone accepts with one voice that Manu was a primitive man and this scripture is his scripture
 ‘manusmriti’ bhartiya samskruti kaa abhinn ang he
 It is counted in such texts of the world, from which humans have gained inspiration for personal behavior and society
 isamen prashn keval dharmik aasthaa yaa vishwaas kaa nahin he
 Every social person has this expectation and aspiration to meet the needs of human life, in any way, by mutual cooperation and in an elegant way
 videshon main is vishay par paryaapt khoj hui he, tulanaatmak adhyayan hua he or samalochanaayen bhi hui hai
 Its place in Hindu society is after Vedatrayi
 manusmriti ke bahut se sanskaran uplabdh hai
 In time, many interpolations are also natural
 saadhaaran vyakti ke liye yah sambhav nahin he ki vah baad main sammilit hue anshon kii pahchaan kar sake
 Only an official scholar can do this after comparative studies
 antoni read kehete hai ki burma, thailand, cambodia, java-bali aadi main dharamshastron or pramukhtah manusmriti, kaa bada aadar tha
 In these countries, these texts were considered to be natural laws and the kings were expected to conduct themselves accordingly
 in granthon kaa pratilipikaran kiya gaya, anuwaad kiya gaya or sthaneey kanoonon main inako sammilit kar liya gaya
 a book memorial called 'bible in India' Louis Jacquilot writes: manusmriti ke kaal evam praneta ke vishay main naveen anusandhankaree vidwaanon ne paryaapt vichaar kiya he
 Some people believe that this memory was named Manusmriti, because it was active in the "human" stage
 koi kehete hai ki manusmriti se pehle koi 'maanav dharmasutra' tha jiskaa aashray lekar kisi ne ek mul manusmriti banaai thi jo baad main upbrunhit hokar vartmaan rup main prachlit ho gai
 Many answers of Manusmriti are considered even when considering for them many of the ideas or sentences which are not found in ancient texts like Nirukta, Mahabharata etc
 is prakaar ke anek tathyon kaa boohaler, pandurang vaaman kane aadi vidwaanon ne paryaapt vivechan kiya he
 It seems quite logical that the theological sentences with the name of Manu were prevalent in the society, whose instructions are in the Mahabharata etc
