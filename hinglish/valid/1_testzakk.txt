 The word 'stereo' is derived from the Greek word stereos, meaning 'solid', and is related to the properties of chemical compounds that depend on the stereoscopic arrangement of the atoms of their molecule
 parmaanuon kii trivim vyavastha kaa sabase pramukh fal trivim samavyawata he
 Isomers are compounds that have the same molecule, but differ in some physical and chemical properties
 yah vibhinnata inke anuon ke bheetar parmaanuon kii vyavastha kii bhinnata ke kaaran hoti he
 The molecule of both ethyl alcohol and dimethyl ether has the same C2H6O, but the configuration of atoms in the molecules is different
 vinyas samavyawata do prakaar kii hoti he : ek prakaashiya samavyawata or duusari jyamitiya samavyawata
 Due to asymmetric optical isomerism, they are lightly active and are similar in many chemical and physical properties
 inkaa sabase pramukh antar dhruvit prakaash ke saath kii kriya he, kyonki in samaavyaviyon kaa ghurnan baraabar or vipareet disha main ho saktaa he
 The chemical and physical properties of geometrical isomers vary

 In 1908, Malus discovered the polarization of light by rotation, and three years later Arago discovered the crystal to be light-active
 1815 i
 main vio ne pataa lagaaya ki thoson ke saath-saath drav or gaisen bhi vilyan main prakashaskriy hoti hai
 Specific rotation - The specific rotation of a lightly active substance is represented by the equation, which is the specific rotation for wavelength l and t degrees of light, and a is the fraction of the rotation of light, from a tube 1 cm long
 The light was obtained by going through it and d per cubic cm of the light-activated object filled in the tube
 Is the concentration
 dahini ore ke ghurnan ko dhanatmak tathaa bain ore ke ghurnan ko rinatmak kehete hai
 The specific rotation is dependent on the light wave, length, temperature, solvent and concentration

 Shelley obtained tartaric acid from the tartar of grapes in 1768, and in 1819, Kestner found an acid derivative of the same composition and named it racemic acid
 1838 i
 main bio ne pataa lagaaya ki tarterik amla prakaashat: sakriy he or racemic amla prakaashat: niskriy he
 After the discovery of polarized light and photoreactivity, significant progress was made by Pastor in the principles of physiology
 paister ne pataa lagaaya ki tarterik or racemic amlon kaa sanghatan tathaa unka sanrachanasutra HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH ek he, par unke bhautik gunon main bhinnata he
 Racimic acid is less soluble in water than tartaric acid, and tartaric acid and its salts are lightly active, but racemic acid and its salts are lightly inactive
 paister kii sabase vikhyath khoj racemic amla ke sodium or ammonium lavan par hui
 When this salt crystallizes at 22 degrees from water, its crystals are different from those of another racemet and have semipermeable panes
 do prakaar ke crystal praapt hote hai, ek to dakshinvart sodium ammonium tarteret kii bhanti sarvasam or duusari taraf ke crystal, jinaki ardhafalakata inke vipareet hoti he
 This second type of crystal is called mirror reflection
 inako jab mishran se pruthak kiya gaya to iskaa jaleey vilyan vamavart tha
 The crystal of acid obtained from it was also in the form of mirror reflection of crystal of tartaric acid and the solution was also counterclockwise
 isliye is amla ko tarterik amla kaa doosraa rup samajha gaya
 Their crystals are asymmetric: yah paaya gaya ki keval ve hi crystal tathaa anu, jinke darpan pratibimb adhyaropit nahin hote, prakaashat: sakriy hote hai
 Such a structure is called asymmetric
 bahut se padaarth thos avasthaa main hi prakaashat: sakriy hote hai, jaise sphatik, sodium chloret aadi
 The first known, optically active substance is crystalline, whose crystals are of two types, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise
 ye donon crystal ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb hai or adhyaropit nahin hote
 Such pairs of crystals are called reflection forms
 sphatik ke galane par isaki sakriyata lupt ho jaati he
 Hence the photosynthetic activation of the crystal is due to its asymmetric crystal structure
 is varg ke padaarth prakaashat: sakriy tabhi tak rahete hai jab tak ve thos rup main hote hai or galane par, vashpikaran se tathaa vilyan main inaki sakriyata nasht ho jaati he
 Many compounds are also lightly active in solid, melting, gaseous or solution states, such as glucose, tartaric acid, etc
 inaki sakriyata yogic kii amamit aanvik sanrachana ke kaaran hoti he
 This molecule and its mirror image are called reflection forms, optical antithesis or optical isomers
 keval do baton ko chhodkar, ye rup bhautik gunon main ek se hote hai
 They give equal and opposite rotation with the same polarized light and have different absorption coefficients with other clockwise and counterclockwise circularly polarized light
 pratibimb roopon ke rasinic gun ek se hote hai par kisi duusare prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke saath kii abhikriya main praaia: antar hota he
 There may also be differences in physiological activity, such as histidine being sweet and histidine tasteless; Nicotine is more toxic than nicotine
 san 1874 main waant hof or le bal ne carbonic yogicon kii prakaashat: samavyawata ke astitv kaa samaadhaan kiya
 Want Half considered that the four valency of carbon is directed towards the four ends of a trigon and the carbon atom is located in the middle of the tetrahedral
 is siddhant ke anusaar methen ke chaaron hydrogen parmaanu samaan honge, jise bhautik or rasinic kriyaaon dwaara siddh bhi kiya gaya
 Earlier in 1858 AD, it was understood that all the four valencies of carbon are in a plane and the carbon atom is at the center of this square
 CX4 anu main carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaayen samaan hai or yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki trivim main inkaa samamit vinyas he
 Thus three arrangements may be possible - planar, pyramidal and tetrahedral
 yadi anu ekataleey ho, to yogic c a b d e ke teen rup sambhav ho sakate hai
 If the molecule is pyramidi, six forms of this compound may be possible
 yadi anu chatushfalkeey he, to yogic c a b d e ke do rup hi sambhav honge or donon ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb honge
 In fact the compound c abde is obtained only in a couple image form, which confirms tetrahedron molecule structure
 jab carbon main sanyojit chaaron samooh bhinn-bhinn hote hai, tab aise carbon ko asamamit carbon kehete hai
 Photosensitively active organic compounds must have one, or more than one, asymmetric carbon atom
 asamamit carbon yogic ke c a b d e donon pratibimb rup jab Ca2 bd main badal jate hai, to keval ek hi prakaashat: niskriy padaarth praapt hota he, jaise dakshinavart or vamavart donon lactic amla avakrut hokar ek hi propionic amla dete hai
 This confirms tetrahedral carbon
 runtgen kiran ke crystalakeey vishleshan, dwidhruv adhurna, avasorana spectrum tathaa electron vivartan ke adhyayan bhi carbon ke chatushfalkeey prakruti kii pushti karte hai
 By mathematical calculation, the angle between any two valency of carbon was 109 ° 28 min
 pehle yah vichaar tha ki yah sanyojak kone sthaayee rahata he, par ab gyaat he ki sanyojaktaa kaa apane sthaan se vichlan ho saktaa he or is kaaran is kone main bhi parivartan ho saktaa he
 When all four atoms or groups associated with a carbon atom are one, this angle is certainly 109 degrees 28 minutes, as in methane, CH4, or carbon tetrachloride, ccl4
 lekin methilin chloride CH2 Cl2, main kone 112 degree paaya jaataa he, kyonki chlorine ke bade parmaanuon ke pratikarshi bal ke kaaran sanyojaktaa kone main adhik failaav sambhav he
 The main difference in isomers with an asymmetric carbon atom is in their optical activation
 donon pratibimb roopon ke ghurnan ke chihr main hi keval antar hota he
 Therefore, they are also known as antiquarianism
 lactic amla, CH3
CHOH
COOH, ke anu ke keval do hi prakaashat: sakriy samaavyavi hai, jo aapas main ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb hote hai
 These are called dectro - and levo - lactic acid
 baraabar anupaaton main donon roopon kaa mishran prakaashat: niskriy hota he, kyonki donon pratibimb roopon kaa ghurnan samaan tathaa disha vipareet hoti he
 Such molecules, homogeneous mixtures, which are externally repulsed and lightly inert, are called racemic metamorphs
 aise racemic yogicon ko r athwa dl- upsargon dwaara nideshit kiya jaataa he
 Thus a compound with an asymmetric carbon atom can be obtained in three forms
 in samaavyaviyon kii sambhaavna asamamit carbon parmaanu par hi nirbhar he
 Asymmetry of carbon disappears, both optical activation and isomerism disappear
 sakriy mailic amla ke donon roopon ke avakrut karne par niskriy saxinic amla, HOOC

CH2
COOH, praapt hota he
 As the number of asymmetric carbon atoms in compounds increases, the possibility of more isomeric forms increases
 saadhaaran dasha main ek asamamit yogic ke, jisamen sankhya da asamamit carbon parmaanu hon, prakaashat: sakriy samaavayavon kii sankhya 2n ho sakati he or 2n-1 pratibimb rooponnau ke jode, arthath 2n racemic rup honge

 yadhyapi isamen do sakriy carbon hai, tathaapi ve ek-duusare ko prabhaavaheen karte hai, kyonki unka ghurnan samaan or vipareet he
 This intermittent molecule is called i or meso form
 niskriy tathaa avibhedit rup un yogicon main sambhav nahin he jinamein ek hi asamamit carbon parmaanu ho
 It differs from racemic forms, which can be distinguished from their photosynthetic forms
 is prakaar kaa sabase uttam udhaaharan diahydrosxinic amla he, jisamen do samaan asamamit carbon hai or jiskaa aitihaasik drushti se bahut mahatv he
 According to the theory, it is obtained from the same mixture of forms southward, counterclockwise and meso-tartaric acid
 dakshinvart or vamavart prakaashat: prativinyasi hai tathaa meso or racemic niskriy hai
 Their structures can be shown as follows: ek jode pratirupon ke baraabar mishran ko racemic rup kehete hai
 This form can occur for the following reasons: baraabar maatra main donon pratirupon ko milaane se
 Synthesis of asymmetric compounds gives a racemic form
 ek prakaashat: sakriy yogic ko racemic rup main parivartan karne kii kriya ko rapeemikaran kehete hai
 Often the + and - forms of compounds can be inhibited by the effects of heat, light and chemical reagents
 parivartan kii kriya yogic or abhikarmakon ke upar nirbhar karti he
 Some compounds are so easy and rapid that they cannot be obtained in an active form
 kuch thode se aise yogic hai jo resimikrut nahin hote
 Differentiation is the action whereby both its reflection forms are separated by a racemic transformation

 Some methods of differentiation are as follows: yantric pruthakkaran - paister ne us vidhi kaa pataa lagaaya jiske anusaar donon pratirupon ke crystal alag alag hote hai or ve haathon se alag kiye ja sakate hai
 Pastor gave sodium ammonium tartrate at 28 degrees Celsius
 By crystallizing, both types of crystals were separated by tongs
 is vidhi kaa upyog bada simit he
 Desiccated Crystallon by Insertion - When a crystal of a reflection form is added to an over saturated solution of a racemic mixture, it is first a crystal of the same reflection form and thus a separation of that form can occur
 jivaracinic vibhedan - kuch jeevanu yaa faphund jab kisi racemic ke tanu vilyan par ugaae jate hai, tab ye ek pratibimb rup ko duusare kii apeksha shighrata se nasht karte hai
 Thus a reflection form can be obtained after a specified time
 penicellium glukam jab racemic ammonium tarteret ke vilyan par ugaaya jaataa he, to pehle dectro rup nasht ho jaataa he or livo batch jaataa he
 Chemical Differentiation - This method is the best

 Selective absorption - Selective absorption of photosensitively active substances can occur by a particular optically active absorber
 anek rasayanagyon ne iske dwaara vibhedan sampann kiya he
 The clockwise and counterclockwise reflection forms were previously directed by the Dactro and Levo prefixes, respectively
 isi bhanti dectry tarterik or livo tarterik amla kaha jaataa tha
 Wanthoff has used the + and - signs to denote the configuration of asymmetric carbon
 baad main fisher ne prastaav kiya ki d or l upsargon kaa prayog unki vinyas sthiti ke liye kiya jaae or inkaa prayog ghurnan kii disha ke liye na kiya jaae
 The sign of rotation of an optically active substance can often be reversed by changes in the experimental condition, and likewise the sign of their kinetics, whose configuration is the same, can also be opposite to the direction of rotation, such as counterclockwise lactic acid salts
 And esters are clockwise and counterclockwise of lactic acid
 in sab kaarnon se vichaar kiya gaya ki prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke liye aise chihn kaa upyog kiya jaae jo sidhe vinyas kii sthiti kaa bodh karaae or yah chihn uske ghurnan disha ke chihn se swatantra ho
 Glyceraldehyde, which has an asymmetric carbon atom, is obtainable in two reflection forms and according to a voluntary determination that the clockwise form shows that the hydroxyl, -OH, carbon of the group is on the right and the hydrogen atom is on the right side
 chatushfalkeey carbon kii vyavastha ke anusaar hydrogen or hydroxil samooh prishth kii sataha se upar he tathaa -CHO or -CH2OH samooh prishth kii sataha se neeche
 This configuration of glyceraldehyde is called D
 prachlit reeti ke anusaar padi rekha dwaara sanyojit samooh prishth kii sataha se upar he
 Like this, there are signs of its state of reflection
 is D- glissraldihide ke pramanik vinyas se sambandhit vinyas D-shrenee ke anrtgat aate hai, arthath ve yogic, jo D- glissraldihide se praapt ho sakate hai, yaa rasinic kriya se D- glissraldihide main parivartit kiye ja sakate hai, D-shrenee main aate hai
 In this way, glyceraldehyde has the full name d glyceraldehyde and l glyceraldehyde
 or isaki ghurnan disha kaa sanket karte hai
 Their aldehyde group can be converted to the next homogeneous - CHOH - CHO and will give each glyceraldehyde two forms as it has an asymmetric carbon
 carbon yogicon main jab ek samooh duusare samooh dwaara pratisthapit hota he, tab yah samajha jaataa he ki pratisthaapak hataae hue samooh kaa sthaan letaa he
 If a lightly active compound changes from a simple substitution reaction to a b compound, their configurations are one
 yah satya he, par kabhi-kabhi pratisthaapan ke saath saath vinyas main parivartan bhi ho jaataa he
 This configuration change is called the optical inversion, or the Walden inversion by the name of the inventor Walden

 When the metal tap is soaked into the ground that it reaches the water level, the tube well is constructed in this way
 nalkupon par mashin-chaalit pump lagaakar unase pani nikaala jaataa he or use pine ke kaam main yaa sichaai ke kaam main liya jaataa he
 By the way, wells or wells have been made by digging the earth and sometimes by putting stairs in them, the form of "baoli" has also been given
 aise kune visheshkar unheen sthalon main banaae jate hai jahaan bhugarbha main aise retile strot hon jinamein pani mil sake
 These sources should also be inundated and not so deep that it is impossible to reach them by normal excavation or to reach the level of a rock or pebble to reach them

 Now it has become easier to reach the water bodies by melting the tubes in the earth itself
 isi prakaar nalkupon kaa bananaa prarambh hua
 The "voki" is tapped by tapping into the earth with a tripod
 jab pani tak nal pahunch jaataa he tab usamen ek chote vyas kaa nal bade vyas ke nal ke andar utaara jaataa he
 a net is applied at the lower end of this small tap, through which water can enter the tap
 is nal ke upar haath se chalanevaala pump laga diya jaataa he
 This is how a normal household tube well becomes
 ye sarvatra hi prayog main aate hai
 When there was a need to draw more water, such as for large water supply schemes or for land irrigation or other industries, then there was a lot of development in the plan to expand tubewells
 bade bade nalkupon ke nirmaan ke liye yah aavashyak hota he ki pehle prithvi main ek bade nal ke dwaara athwa anya sadhano dwaara gaharaa gol chhidr kiya jaae or us chhidr se iskaa anumaan kiya jaae ki aise kitne str milte hai jo jalplavit hai or unki motaai kitni he
 For example, for a general irrigation tube well, ganga-yamuna-doab in Uttar Pradesh first has a hole of 300, 350 or 400 feet deep with a circumference of ten or eight inches
 chhidr karte samay yah anumaan kiya jaataa he ki kis prakaar ke staron ko bhedakar chhidr gaya he or unase nikaale hue namoonon kii pariksha par yah nirnay kiya jaataa he ki unke koun se str jal se bhare ho sakate hai
 If such a level of about 100 feet is found, then a good amount of water is expected to be obtained from that hole
 vaise pani mil sakane kii maatra kaa anumaan to pani nikaalane par hi kiya ja saktaa he kintu bahut si baaten is sambandh main anubhav ke upar hi nirbhar karti hai
 The level of sand that is flooded can be forged
 yah jaali chhidradaar nalon ke upar madhi hoti he or jisamen hokar pani nalakup ke andar pravesh karata he
 These nets have a variety of textures
 kuch taanbe ke taron kii bani hoti he, kuch pital kii chaddaron main khaanche banaakar taiyaar kii jaati hai
 Sometimes, a rope of coconut is used on the perforated tap and is used instead of a mesh
 ye sab saadhan isliye prayukt kiye jate hai ki svachh pani chhanakar nalakup ke andar aa sake or vahaan se panpon dwaara use upar nikaala ja sake
 a new system of filtering water in the tube well is that the perforated taps are discharged into the tube well and the gravel is filled around them, which acts as a mesh and only allows clean water to enter the tube
 nalakup ke chaaron ore sthit baaluu ke kanon kaa pani ke saath bahakar aana yaa na aana nalakup main pani ke aane kii gati ke upar nirbhar karata he
 However, at the time of making tubewells, water is removed to such an extent that the sand particles emanating from it come out and a permanent state is formed around the tube well so that sand does not come with the drainage of water
 ise nalakup kaa vikaas kehete hai
 Many improvements are being made in tubewell construction
 prithvi ke andar chhidr karne ke liye tarah-tarah kii mashine prayog main laai jaati hai
 These machines not only help in the construction of tube wells, but the work is also done quickly
 kahin kahin nal ke bina bhi prithvi main chhidr kiye jate hai or saath hi saath unako chikani mitti ke vilyan se pakkaa sa kar diya jaataa he
 Then tube wells are removed in it
 yadi kahin chikani mitti kaa acha motaa str mil jaataa he or phir uske neeche acha jalplavit ret kaa str ho to "gart" nalakup bhi banaae ja sakate hai
 In this, it forms a trough below the level of clay when the sand comes out, in which water keeps coming in and it is pumped out by a tube pump
 nalkupon se pani nikaalane ke liye kai prakaar ke pump prayog main laae jate hai
 Initially, centrifugal pumps were installed, through which water could be raised to a limited height
 ab tarabine tip bor hole pump kaa prachaar bad gaya he
 These pumps can lift water up to very high levels
 iske atirikt nimajjaneey pump bhi istemaal kiye jate hai
 Both these pumps and motors are submerged under water
 inke nikaalane or lagane main badi suvidha rahati he
 One of the notable things in relation to tube wells is that large quantities of water are sometimes taken out of the ground by the tube wells
 bhugarbha main pani kii maatra simit hi hoti he or uskaa vaarshik nirgam bhi simit rahata he
 If more water enters the ground each year, if more water is extracted from the ground by tube wells, then the ground water of the ground is degraded and sometimes it has great consequences
 uttari america ke pashchimi tat par california pradesh main udyog tathaa krishi ke liye itane adhik nalakup bana die ki bhugarbha kaa jalatal itnaa nicha ho gaya ki samudr kaa khara jal bhugarbha ke jalatal main aa mila or sara jalstrot kharaab ho gaya
 Therefore, before removing the water from the tube well, it is necessary to test that no area has so many tube wells that the ground water in the geology reaches its consequences
 vaise, aise sthalon par aisi vyavastha kii jaati he ki bhugarbha main jal kaa pravesh adhikadhik ho sake
 It is difficult to estimate the water source inside the geology, so it would be difficult to determine the extent of expansion of tube wells
 kahin kahin yugon ke sanchit jal ko ham nalkupon dwaara baahar nikaalkar upyog main le jate hai or phir bhugarbha main jal kam ho jane par kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Therefore, vigilance is required in the expansion of tube wells
 jitne samay nalkupon dwaara jal nikaala jaataa he, utane samay aas-paas ke saadhaaran kuon main jalatal nicha ho jaataa he or kahin-kahin kuen bilkul suukh jate hai
 Investigations in this regard have shown that the water level around the tube well falls as a funnel of water fall, so the ordinary wells that fall inside this funnel fall into the water table

 manovikar kisi vyakti ke maansik swasthya kii vah sthiti he jise kisi swasth vyakti se tulana karne par 'saamaanya' nahin kaha jaataa
 In comparison to healthy individuals, the behavior of persons with psychiatry is determined to be abnormal or misdemeanor and involves significant pain or inability
 inhen manorog, maansik rog, maansik beemaari athwa maansik vikaar bhi kehete hai
 Psychiatrists are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain and psychiatric treatment is required for their treatment
 manovigyaan main hamaare liye asaamaanya or anuchit vyavhaaron ko manovikar kaha jaataa he
 They grow slowly
 manovikaron ke bahut se kaarak hai, jinamein anuvaanshikta, kamjor vyaktitv, sahansheeltaa kaa abhaav, baalyavastha ke anubhav, tanaavpurn paristhitiyaan or inkaa saamana karne kii asamarthy sammilit hai
 The situations that a person finds difficult to solve and cope with are called 'stress factors'
 tanaav kisi vyakti par aisi aavashyaktaaon va maangon ko thope detaa he jise puraa karnaa vah ati dubhar or mushkil samajhataa he
 Persistent failure to meet these demands creates mental tension in the person
 aaj ke samay main tanaav logon ke liye bahut hi saamaanya anubhav ban chukaa he, jo ki adhisankhya daihik or manovaigyanik pratikriyaaon dwaara vyakt hota he
 The traditional definition of stress focuses on the somatic response
 hens style ne 'tanaav' shabd ko khoja or isaki paribhaasha sharir kii kisi bhi aavashyaktaa ke aadhaar par anishchit pratikriya ke rup main kii
 The definition of Hans Shale's base is somatic and gives greater importance to the actions of hormones, which are secreted by the adrenals and other glands
 style ne do prakaar ke tanaavon kii sankalpana kii- The new approach to stress focuses on the role of assessment and interpretation of the situation in relation to the adjustment resources available to the individual
 moolyankan or samaayojan kii anyonyashrith prakriyaayen vyakti ke vaataavaran evam uske anukulan ke bich sambandh nirdhaaran karti he
 Adaptation is the process by which an individual arranges the conditions and environment around him to maintain optimal levels of somatic, psychological and social interest
 tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa saamana karte samay aamtaur par vyakti samasya kendrit yaa manobhaav kendrit kootneetiyon ko apanaataa he
 a problem-focused policy uses a person's intellectual solutions to find solutions to stressful situations and often leads to an effective solution
 manobhaav kendrit niti dwaara tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa saamana karte samay vyakti bhaavnaatmak vyavhaar ko pradarshit karata he jaise chillaanaa
 Although, if a person is unable to cope with stress, then he / she tends to resist-oriented diplomacy, different behaviors can arise if these are adopted repeatedly
 pratirohak-abhivinyast vyavhaar paristhiti kaa saamana karne main samarth nahin banaate, ye keval apni kaarywahiyon ko nyaaysangat dikhaane kaa jariya maatr he
 Physical problems like fever, cough, cold etc
 These are different types of psychosis
 in virgon ke manovikaron kii suchi nunatam vyagrata se lekar gambhir manovikaron jaise manobhaajan yaa khandit maansikta tak he
 Clinical and Statistical Manual on Psychiatry) has been published by the American Psychiatric Association, which mentions a wide variety of mental disorders
 manovigyaan kii jo shakha vikaron kaa samaadhaan khojati he use asaamaanya manovigyaan kaha jaataa he
 You might be surprised to know that children can also become psychotic
 dsam, kaa chauthaa sanskaran baalyavastha ke vibhinn prakaar ke vikaron kaa samaadhaan dhundta he, aamtaur par yah pehali baar shaishavkaal, baalyavastha yaa kishoravastha main pahchaan main aate hai
 Some of these careful-absence hyperactive disorders are found in which the child is not careful or focused or he behaves very agile
 or swalin vikaar jisamen baccha antarmukhi ho jaataa he, bilkul nahin muskuraataa or der se bhashaa sikhta he
 If a person feels scared, scared or anxious without any specific reason, then it can be said that the person is suffering from anxiety disorder
 vyagrata vikaar ke vibhinn prakaar hote hai jisamen chintaa kii bhaavana vibhinn roopon main dikhaai detii he
 Some of these disorders are caused by extreme and unconditional fear of something and obsessive-compulsive disorder where a person keeps thinking the same thing again and again and repeating their actions
 ve vyakti jo manodasha vikaar ke anubhavon se grasit hote hai unke manobhaav dirghakaal tak pratibandhit ho jate hai, ve vyakti kisi ek manobhaav par sthir ho jate hai, yaa in bhaavon kii shreniyon main adal-badal karte rahete hai
 For example, whether a person remains depressed for a few days or remains depressed on one day and remains happy the next day, his behavior has nothing to do with the situation
 is tarah vyakti ke vyavhaarik lakshanon par ashrith manodasha vikaar do prakaar ke hote hai - Depression is a mental state that is characterized by sadness, lack of interest and lack of pleasure in daily activities, restless sleep and loss of sleep, less hunger, no weight loss, or more hunger and weight gain, laziness, feeling guilty , Shows disqualification, helplessness, despair, Shani in establishing concentration and signs of negative ideology towards herself and others
 yadi kisi vyakti ko is tarah ke bhav nunatam do saptaah tak rahen to use avsaadagrast kaha ja saktaa he or us ke upachaar ke liye use sheeghra naidanik chikitsa pradaan karwaanaa aavashyak he
 In today's time, some diseases have become very common such as low blood pressure, high blood pressure, diabetes etc
 vaise to ye sab shaareerik bimaariyaan hai parantu ye manavaigyanik kaarnon jaise tanaav va chintaa se utpann hoti hai
 So psychosomatic disorders are psychological problems that exhibit physical symptoms, but are psychological due to this
 vahiin manodaihik kii avadharana main man kaa arth maanas he or daihik kaa arth sharir he
 Conversely, somatic disorders are disorders whose symptoms are physical but their biological causes are not revealed
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi koi vyakti petdard kii shikaayat kar rahaa he parantu tab bhi jab uske us khaas ang arthath pet main kisi tarah kii koi samasya nahin hoti
 After a traumatic event, a person is unable to recognize his / her past existence, past events and the people around them
 naidanik manovigyaan main is tarah kii samasyaon ko vighatnsheel vikaar kaha jaataa he, jisamen kisi vyakti kaa vyaktitv samajadhut va samaaj se pruthak ho jaataa he
 Disruptive amnesia is a class of disruptive psychosis in which a person is usually unable to recall important personal information after a stressful event
 vighatan kii sthiti main vyakti apane naye astitv ko mahasoos karata he
 The second category is disruptive identity disorder in which a person loses his memory, while he starts imagining a new existence
 anya varg vyaktitwalope vikaar he, jisamen vyakti achaanak badlaav yaa bhinn prakaar se vicitra mahasoos karata he
 a person feels as if he has abandoned his body or his movements suddenly become mechanical or dreamlike
 haalanki vighatan manovikar kii sab se gambheer sthiti tab utpann ho ti he jab koi ekaadhik vyaktitv manovikar va vighatan astitv manovikar se grast ho
 In this situation diverse personalities appear at different times in the same person
 aapane sadak par kabhi kisi vyakti ko gande kapadon main, kooday ke aasapaas pade asvachh bhojan ko khate yaa phir ajeeb tareeke se baatcheet yaa vyavhaar karte hue dekha hoga
 They have a weak orientation in terms of person, place and time
 ham aksar unhen pagal, besudha aadi kah dete hai, parantu naidanik bhashaa main inhen manovidhlit kehete hai
 This is a serious state of psychosis, which results from disturbed thoughts, feelings and behavior
 manovidalan vikaron main asangat maansikta, doshapurn abhigna, sanchaalak kaaryakalapon main baadha, neeras va anupyukt bhav hote hai
 People suffering from this are obsessed with reality and often get lost in the world of fantasy and misconception
 vibhranti kaa arth kisi aisi cheez ko dekhnaa he jo vastav main bhautik rup se vahaan nahin hoti, kuch aisi awaajen jo vahaan par vastav main nahin hai
 Illusionism is blind faith in reality
 Such beliefs dissuade others
 manovidalan ke vibhinn prakaar hai jaise catatonic manovidalan
 The personality disorder has its roots in a person's infancy, where some children develop a maladaptive and impolite ideology
 ye vibhinn vyaktitv manovikar vyakti main hanirahit algaav se le kar bhaavanahin kramik hatyare ke rup main saamne aate hai
 The categories of personality psychosis can be classified into three groups
 pehle, samooh kii visheshta ajeeb or sanakee vyavhaar he
 Anxiety and doubt are characteristic of the second group and the third group is characterized by dramatic, emotional and erratic behavior
 pehle samooh main vyamohabh, intarvabandha, pagal vyaktitv vikaar sammilit hai
 The second group is characterized by dependent, altered, obsessive personality psychosis
 asaamaajik, simavarti, abhinay, atmmohi vyaktitv vikaar tisare samooh ke antargat aate hai
 To deal with any type of psychosis, the person is served by some specialized psychotherapeutic procedure
 vah vyakti jo manashchikitsa ke craryakram kaa praaroop tay karata he vah prashikshit vyakti hota he, jise naidanik manovaigyanik yaa manochikitsak kehete hai
 The person who gets this treatment is called a servant / patient
 manashchikitsa ko aksar vaarta upachaar kaha jaataa he kyon ki ye antarvaiyaktik sampark dwaara pradaan kii jaati he
 Its drugs can only be given by a psychiatrist, who is a medicinal doctor
 There are various techniques of psychiatry, which describe the cause and development of abnormal behaviors
 inamen manovishleshan, vyavhaar chikitsa, sangyanatmak-vyavhaar chikitsa, sevaarthee kendrit chikitsa ityadi sammilit hai
 Psychiatry is a designed scheme that is designed keeping in mind the nature and severity of psychosis
 vyakti tanaav se nipatane ke liye aamtaur par kaary-abhivinyast or pratiraksha-abhivinyast yaa manobhaav kendrit prakriyaaon kaa paalan karata he
 The purpose of the work oriented process is to find a realistic solution to the adjusting demand imposed by a particular stress factor
 ye chetan or tarksangat str par tanaavpurn sthitiyon ke vastunishth moolyankan par aadhaarit hoti hai
 These methods of dealing with stress are divided into three categories such as initiation, withdrawal and compromise
 manobhaav kendrit yaa aatmaraksha-abhivinyast tareekon se tanaav kaa saamana karnaa laabhakaari siddh nahin hota, kyonki vyakti iske dwaara kisi samaadhaan par nahin pahunchataa, bas swayan ko aashwaasan dene ke tareeke dhundta he
 An example of self-preservation methods is intelligent interpretation such as arguing that all students failed because exam papers were difficult
 iskaa anya udhaaharan he visthaapan karnaa jaise sakht adhyaaapak par aa rahe krodh ko apane chote bhai ko daant yaa maar kar utaarna
 Here you have displaced anger
 yah samajhnaa bahut mahatvapurn he ki tanaav se prabhaavshaalee tareeke se nipatane ke liye vyakti ko swasth jeevanstyli ko apnaanaa chahie
 Stress cannot be better dealt with only by positive thinking, emotions and actions, but by this we feel very happy and light in life, and become more worthy
 maansik vikaar bahut tarah ke hote hai
 These disorders can be related to personality, mood, eating habits, anxiety etc
 is prakaar maansik rogon kii suchi bahut badi he
 a list of some main psychiatrists is given below- manorogon ke kaaran kai prakaar ke hote hai
 The following are the main types of these: anuvanshik :manoveekshipti yaa psychosis, vyaktitv rog, madirapan, mandabuddhi, mirgee ityadi rog un logon main adhik paye jate hai, jinke parivaar kaa koi sadsy inase peedit hon to santan ko inkaa khatra lagbhag doguna ho jaataa he
 Affective diseases, hysteria, heart disease, etc
 are more prevalent in macro individuals, whereas fragmented psychosis, stress, personality diseases are more common in people with long and lean formation
 apane main khoye hue, chup rahane vaale, kam mitra rakhane vaale kitaabi-keede jaise gun vaale, skijid vyaktitv vaale logon main schijophreniya adhik hota he, jabaki anushaasit tathaa safai pasand, samaynishth, mitavyayi jaise gunon vaale khapati vyaktitv ke logon main khapat rog adhik paaya jaataa he
 Physical changes such as adolescence, puberty, old age, pregnancy can form the basis of many psychiatric conditions
 kuch dawaaon, rasinic tatwon, dhaatuon, madiraa tathaa anya maadak padaarthon ityadi kaa seven manorogon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ban saktaa hai
 Stress in mutual relations, death of a loved one, loss of respect, loss of work, financial loss, marriage, divorce, childbirth, retirement, examination or failure in love, etc
 also contribute to creating or enhancing psychopaths
 Huh
 saamaajik evam manoranjak gatividhiyon se duraav, akelaapan, raajnneetik, prakritik yaa saamaajik durghatnaayen manorog utpann kar sakate hai
 Mental illness or insanity is a term with which many misconceptions and apprehensions are attached about its causes and treatment
 kuch log ise ek asaadhya, anuvaanshik evam chhot kii beemaari maanate hai, to kuch jaadu-tona, bhoot-pret va dian kaa prakope
 Some even consider it as a drama to avoid responsibilities rather than disease
 agyani log upachaar ke liye sthaneey yaa najadik ojha, pandit, mullah aadi ke paas jaakar anaavashyak bhabhoot, jadi-booti kaa seven karte hai tathaa amanviya bhang se sataaye jate hai taaki 'pishachatma' kaa prakope dur kiya ja sake

 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language
 in vibhinn bhashaayon ke shabdon ke rup isliye milte-julate the kyonki yah ek hi pracheen jad se utpann hue sajaateey shabd the
 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european

 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh

 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued

 vayask hone or shashansutra sanbhaalane ke pashchaat jaisingh ne apana dhyaan sameepvarti rajyon kii vijay kii ore diya
 After several wars, he was able to defeat Navaghan or Khangar, the severe ruler of Saurashtra
 vijit pradesh ke shashan ke liye usne sajjan naam ke adhikari ko praantpal niyukt kiya kintu sambhavat: jaisingh kaa adhikaar chirsthayee nahin ho paaya
 Jaisingh obliged the Asharaj of the Chahman dynasty of Nadol, the old enemy of the Chalukyas, to accept subjugation and rule as a feudal lord
 usne uttar main shakambhari ke chaahmaan rajya par bhi akraman kiya or uski rajdhani par adhikaar kar liya
 But like a skilled technician, he strengthened his side by marrying his daughter to the ardent King Arnoraj and allowing Arnoraj to rule as a feudal lord

 In the end, Jai Singh still won

 Jaisingh could not achieve any notable success against Chandel Naresh Madanavarman
 sambhavat: maalav main madanvarman kii safaltaaon se aashaankit hokar hi usne tripuri ke kalchuri or gahadwaalon se maitreepurn sambandh banaae
 Vikramaditya Sastha of the Western Chalukya dynasty of Kalyan has mentioned several victories in the north of the Narmada and on the Lats and Gurjars
 kintu ye kshanik abhiyaan maatr rahe honge or chalukya rajya par inkaa koi bhi prabhaav nahin tha
 In one of his inscriptions, Jai Singh mentions his victory over Permardi, but there is a possibility that the defeated king was an ordinary king, not the famous Chalukya king
 jaisingh ko sindhuraj par vijay kaa bhi shrey diya gaya he jo sindh kaa koi sthaneey muslim samant rahaa hoga
 Jaisingh also defeated Barbarq, who was probably of a non-aryan caste living in Gujarat and gave tragedy to the Sadhus of Siddhpur

 Jaisingh was sonless

 After his death, the throne was handed over to his great-grandson Kemarapala's great-grandson Kumarapala
 kintu kshemraj oras putr nahin tha, isliye jaisingh ne apane mantri udayan ke putr bahad ko apana dattak putr banaaya tha
 Jaisingh is remembered more than his victories due to his cultural acts
 jaisingh ne kaviyon or vidwaanon ko prashray dekar gujarat ko shiksha or sahitya ke centre ke rup main pratishthit kar diya
 The names of Ramachandra, Acharya Jayamangal, Yashachandra and Vardhaman are notable among these writers
 shripal ko usne kavindra kii oopaadhi di thi or use apana bhai kahata tha
 But more than all these scholars and famous and special beloved and affectionate of Jai Singh whose versatility did not shine the importance of other contemporary scholars, was Jain Pandit Hemachandra
 apane vyakaran granth siddhahemchandra ke dwaara usne siddhraj kaa naam amar kar diya he
 Jayasih was Shaivamatavalambi
 meruttung ke anusaar usne apana mata ke kehane par bahulod main yatriyon se liya janevaala kar samaapt kar diya

 The destiny of a person can be known through astrology and yogasamadhi
 usamen yogamadhi jo ki ashtaang yoga kaa utkrishtatam ang he, karodon manushyon main kisi birle sadhak ko hi siddh ho paati he

 In medical astrology, diseases are decided on the basis of these disciplines and based on that, remedies are also taken to remove its astrological cause
 isliye chikitsa jyotish ko jyotish dwaara rog nidaan kii vidya bhi kaha jaataa he
 In English it is called medical astrology

 Maharishi Kashyap was the famous "toxic scientist" of that period
 maharishi ne rajmahal kii ore prasthaan kiya, maarg main unhen takshak naag mila jo raja parakshit ko dasane ja rahaa tha
 Takshaka asked Kashyapa, "where are you going, Lord?" i will make him poison free, which will give wealth and fame
 ’’ takshak apni chhadam vesh tyagkar vaastavik rup main prakat ho gaya or kaha, ‘‘main is hare-bhare vriksh par dansh kaa prayog kar rahaa hoon
 Hey Maharishi aap apni vidya kaa prayog dikhaaen
 '' And by using the poison of Takshak, that tree was made of Krishna color and dry
 maharishi kashyap ne apane agad prayog se us vriksh ko purvavat haraa-bharaa kar diya
 On seeing this, Takshak became disappointed
 tab takshak ne maharishi kashyap se nivedan kiya ki, ‘‘aapkaa upachaar faldaayi tabhi hoga jab raja kaa ayushya shesh hoga
 If that has happened, you will not get fame in your work
 ’’ kashyap ne tatkaal jyotish gananaa karke pataa lagaaya ki raja kii aayu main kuch ghadi shesh hai
 Knowing this, they returned to their place
