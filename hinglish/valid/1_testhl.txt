 Devotion was also preached in the free form of sects
 mira, raskhaan, rahim kaa naam utani hi shraddha se liya jaataa he jitna ki kisi sampradayabaddh sant kavi kaa

 aikanthik bhakthi ne samshtigat rup dhaaran kiya or jan-jan ke hriday ko aplavit kar diya
 Shortly after Tulsi's death, the signs of Reetikal's arrival were visible

 In the Bhakti Yug, devotional literature was composed mainly in this way, but it cannot be said completely that there was no other type of literature in that period
 yah akbar kaa shashan kaal tha tathaa uske darbar main anek kavi the
 Some of the royal poems of Abdurrahim Khankhana etc
 are found

 She chases him at the train station but Madhu slaps her when she confesses that she is in love with Raj
 jab tak raaj vahaan pahunchataa he, madhu samay se pehle prasav-vednaa main chali gai
 The doctor announces that only one - Madhu or his child can be saved and Priya asks him to save Madhu

 vyavsaay prakriya prabandhan ek aisa prabandhan drushtikon he, jiskaa dhyaan graahakon kii zaruuraton or aavashyaktaaon ke saath sanghathan ke sabhi pahaluon ke suyojan par kendrit he
 It is a holistic management approach that promotes innovation and flexibility in business, while striving for innovation, flexibility, integration with technology
 vyavsaay prakriya prabandhan satat rup se prakriyaaon main sudhaar kaa prayaas karata he
 Therefore it can be described as a "process optimization process"
 yah tark diya gaya he ki BPM sanghathanon ko prayojnatmak rup se kendrit, paaramparik padanukramit prabandhan drushtikon kii tulana main or adhik kushal or adhik prabhavi or parivartan ke liye adhik sakasham banaata he
 a business process is "a series or network of value-added activities performed by its respective characters or associates, for the purposeful attainment of a common business goal
 "ye prakriyaayein kisi bhi sanghathan ke liye mahatvapurn hai kyonki ve rajasav utpann karti hai or aksar laagat ke mahatvapurn anupaat kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 As a managerial approach, processes are considered as assets of strategic importance to an organization that must be understood, operated, and improved to provide value-added products and services to customers
 yah aadhaar anya kul gunvattta prabandhan yaa nirantar sudhaar prakriya paddatiyon yaa drushtikon se bahut hi miltaa-julata he
 BPM goes one step further by stating that this approach can be supported, or enabled through technology, to ensure the feasibility of a managerial approach in times of stress and change
 In fact, BPM is an approach to the integration of "change capability" in the organization - both human and technical
 is tarah, kai BPM lekh or pandit aksar BPM kii charchaa ek yaa do drushtikon se karte hai: log or / yaa praudyogiki
 Broadly speaking, the idea of process is as traditional as concepts of work, department, production, output
 Current management and improvement approaches have existed since the early 1990s, with formal definitions and technical modeling
 Note that in the IT community, the term 'business process' is often used to manage middleware processes; Or application is used as a synonym for the integration of software functions
 yah drushtikon atyadhik pratibandhak lag saktaa he
 This has to be kept in mind when reading software engineering documents that refer to 'business processes' or 'business modeling'
 haalanki BPM kaa praarambhik dhyaan yantriki vyavsaayik prakriyaaon ke swachaalan par tha, ise baad se maanav chaalit prakriyaaon tak vistrut kar diya gaya, jahaan shrinkhalaaon main yaa yantriki prakriyaaon ke samanaantar maanviya anyonya kriya hoti he
 For example, when a person steps into the business process where human intuition or decision making is required, these steps are assigned to the appropriate members of the organization
 maanav parsparik-kriya prabandhan jaise adhik unnat roopon main ek kaarysmooh ke kaary ko nishpadit karne ke liye maanav kaaryakartaaon ke bich jatil anyonya kriya hoti he
 In this case, many people and systems interact in structured, ad hoc, and sometimes fully dynamic ways to accomplish more than one task
 BPM kaa upyog sansthaaon ko vistrut paridrishyon ke madhyam se samajhane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jo anyathaa vyavasthit karne or prastutikaran ke liye uplabdh nahin hoga
 in vichaaron main shaamil he prakriyaaon kaa ek duusare ke saath sambandh, jo prakriya model main shaamil kiye jane par, unnat reporting or vishleshan pradaan karte hai, jo anyathaa uplabdh nahin hote hai
 BPM is considered by some to be the backbone of enterprise content management
 kyonki BPM sanghathanon ko praudyogiki aadharbhoot sanrachanaon se vyapaar prakriya saar prastuti anumat karata he, yah vyavsaay prakriyaaon ke swachaalan yaa vyavsaayik samasyaon ke samaadhaan se pare chalaa jaataa he
 BPM enables businesses to respond to changing consumer, market, and regulatory demands faster than their competitors
 abhi haal hi main, praudyogiki ne sicks sigma jaisi anya paddatiyon ke saath BPM ke yugman ko anumat kiya he
 BPM tools now allow the user to: yah apane saath vaastavik jivan data ke aadhaar par aapke vyavsaay prakriya main parivartan ke anukaran ko sakasham banane kaa laabh le aayega or udyog paddatiyon se BPM kaa yugman upyogkarta ko lagaataar prakriya saral or kargar banane or uskaa anukulan anumat karata he taaki vah apni bazaar kii zaruuraton ke mutabik susangat ho jaae
 Business process management activities can be divided into five categories: design, modeling, execution, monitoring, and optimization
 prakriya dizine main prachlit prakriyaaon kii pahchaan or "bhavi" prakriyaaon kii dizine donon shaamil hai
 Areas of focus include representation of process flow, actors within it, warnings and notifications, escalations, standard operating procedures, service level agreements, and task delivery mechanisms
 acchhee dizine, prakriya ke jivan-kaal main samasyaon kii sankhya kam karti he
 Regardless of whether existing processes are considered or not, the goal of this step is to ensure that a correct and efficient theoretical design is developed
 prastaavit sudhaar maanav-se-maanav, maanav-se-pranali or system-se-system varkelo ho saktaa he or viniamak, bazaar, yaa vyavsaay dwaara saamana kii ja rahi pratispardhi chunautiyon ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 Modeling takes theoretical design and enforces a combination of variables
 isamen prakriyaaon par "what-if vishleshan" chalaanaa bhi shaamil he: "kya hoga yadi mere paas ek jaisaa kaam karne ke liye 75% sansaadhan hai?" "kya hoga yadi main vahi kaam maujuuda laagat ke 80% par karnaa chaahun?"
 One of the ways to automate processes is to develop or purchase applications that implement the expected steps of the process; However, in practice, these applications rarely and accurately execute all steps of the process
 ek or drushtikon he software or maanav hastkshep ke sangyojan kaa upyog karnaa; lekin yah drushtikon adhik jatil he, jisase pralekhan prakriya kathin ban jaati he
 In response to these problems, software has been developed that enables an entire business process, defined in computer language, to be implemented directly on the computer
 The system will use services in related applications for the execution of business operations or, or when a phase is too complex for automation, to seek human input
 Compared to either of the previous approaches, the direct implementation of the process definition will be more explicit and therefore easier to improve
 However, automation of process definitions requires flexibility and extensive infrastructure, which generally forbids implementation of these systems in legacy IT environments
 niyantrak vyavhaaron ke liye paribhaasha uplabdh karaane hetu pranaaliyon dwaara vyapaar niyamon kaa upyog kiya gaya he or prakriya karyanvayan or prastaavon ko chalaane ke liye vyapaar niyam ingine kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Monitoring involves tracking of individual processes, so that information on their status can be easily seen and data can be provided on the performance of one or more processes
 An example of tracking is to be able to determine the status of customer orders so that problems in this operation can be identified and corrected
 iske atirikt, is jaankaree kaa istemaal graahakon or aapurtikartaaon ke saath kaam karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he taaki unki sambandhit prakriyaaon main sudhaar ho
 aankadon ke udhaaharan hai graahak aadesh ke twarit sansaadhan par upaay janit karnaa yaa pichley maheene kitne aadesh sansaadhit kiye gaye
 These measures fit into three categories: cycle time, defect rate and productivity
 nigaraanee kii maatra is par nirbhar hogi ki vyavsaay dwaara kis soochna kaa moolyankan or vishleshan apekshit he or vyavsaay uski kisi nigaraanee chahta he, vaastavik samay, sannikat vaastivak samay yaa tadarth
 idhar, kaarobaar gatividhi nigaraanee nigaraanee upkarnon ko pradaan or vistaarit karata he jo aam taur par BPMS dwaara uplabdh karaae jate hai
 Process mining is a collection of methods and tools related to process monitoring
 prakriya khanan kaa uddeshy he prakriya anurakshan ke madhyam se nikaale gaye ghatana log kaa vishleshan or ek a priori prakriya model ke saath unki tulana
 prakriya khanan prakriya vishleshkon ko vaastavik prakriya karyanvayan or ek pryori model ke bich visangatiyon kaa pataa lagane or baadhaon ke vishleshan ko anumat karti he
 Process optimization involves retrieval of process execution from the modeling or maintenance phase; Identification of potential or real constraints and potential opportunities for cost savings or other improvements; And then, applying those enhancements to the process design
 Overall, it produces higher trade value
 jahaan charnon ko ek chakra ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, aarthik yaa samay kii kami prakriya ko keval kuch punaravartanon tak hi simit karne kii sambhaavna he
 This is often the case when an approach is used by an organization for short- to medium-term objectives rather than changing the organizational culture
 vaastavik punraritiyaan keval prakriya main bhaag lene waalon ke sahyogi prayaason ke zarie hi sambhav hai
 For complexity in most organizations, these daily process management challenges require technology capable of supporting process participants
 aaj tak, kai sanghathanon ne is uddeshy ke saath aksar BPM pariyojna yaa kaarykram shuru kiya he ki kisi aise kshetra kaa anukulan kiya jaae jis kshetra kii sudhaar ke liye pahchaan kii gai he
 In the financial sector, BPM is essential to ensure that the system delivers quality service even while maintaining regulatory compliance
 samprati, kaary ke liye antarrashtriya maanak keval IT kshetron ke liye anuprayog tak hi simit hai or ISO / IEC 15944 vyavsaay ke prachaalan pahaluon ko aavrutt karata he
 However, some corporations with a culture of best practices use standard operating procedures to regulate their operational processes
 is samay anya maanakon par kaam kiya ja rahaa he taaki BPM karyanvayan kii sahaayta kar sake 
 Some people define a BPM system or set as "the whole BPM"
 anya udhyam software packejon ke bich gatisheel soochna kii mahatvapurn avadharana ko varnit karte hai or tatkaal seva unmukh sanrachana ke bare main vichaar karte hai
 Also, some people will limit the definition to "modeling 


 to create the 'right' process"
 ye aanshik jawaab hai or takneekee prastutiyon kaa viksit hona jari rahegaa
 BPMS pad sambhawatah naa rahe
 aaj isamen samarth praudyogiki ke madhyam se prabandhkeey drushtikon ke samarthan kii avadharana shaamil he
 BPMS enable all stakeholders to have a solid understanding about an organization and its execution
 BPMS facilitate the change of business process during the life cycle described above
 This will be helpful in automation of activities, collaboration with other systems, integration, integration of associates etc
 through the value chain
 For example, the size and complexity of daily tasks often requires the use of technology for efficient models
 ye model swachaalan or vyapaar samasyaon ke samaadhaan kii suvidha pradaan karte hai
 These models can also be executables to assist in the maintenance and control of business processes
 atah, kuch log BPM ko "soochna praudyogiki or vyavsaay ke bich sethu" ke rup main bhi dekhte hai
 
 In fact, an argument can be made that this "holistic approach" combines organizational and technical silos
 BPM set ke chaar mahatvapurn ghatak hai: BPM also addresses a number of important IT issues supporting these business drivers, including: BPMS kaa manyakaran ek anya takneekee mudda he jiske bare main vikritaon or upyogkartaaon ko jaanane kii zarurat he, yadi niamak anupaalan anivaary he
 Validation work can be performed either by authorized third parties or by the users themselves
 donon hi tarah se, manyakaran pralekhan utpann karne kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 manyakaran dastauez aam taur par yaa to aadhikarik taur par prakashit kar sakate hai yaa upyogkartaaon dwaara pratidhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
