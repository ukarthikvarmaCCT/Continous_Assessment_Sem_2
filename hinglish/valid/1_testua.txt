 During this, oxygen and carbon dioxide gas are exchanged between the living and their environment and by this action, the oxygen gas reaches the respiratory organs of living organisms
 oxygen gas shwasan angon se visaran dwaara rakt main pravesh kar jaati he
 Blood is the medium of transport that carries this oxygen to the cells of different parts of the body
 vahaan iskaa upyog koshikaaye apane koshikeey shwasan main karti hai
 Respiratory activity occurs in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of each living cell
 shwasan sambandhit praarambhik kriyaayein cytoplasm main hoti he tathaa shesh kriyaayein mitocandriaon main hoti hai
 Since most of the energy is produced in the last phase of the action itself
 isliye mitocandria ko koshika kaa shwasanang yaa shakti-grih kaha jaataa he
 In the first phase of the action of respiration, the fluids go away and the remaining 96 percent of the energy is stored in pyruvic acid
 glicolisis ke pehle paanch charan main 6 carbon vishisht glucose kaa anu urja ke prayog se teen carbon vaale anu main vighatit hota he
 The Krebs cycle is the second stage of oxy respiration
 yah eukariotic koshika ke mitocondria tathaa prokariots ke koshika drav main hoti he
 In this activity, the end substance of glycolysis is pyruvic acid fully oxidized to carbon dioxide and water and many substances are used which are used in other biochemical circuits like amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, fatty acids and glucose etc
 It is used in the manufacture of energy and a large amount of energy is released
 yah kriya kai charnon main hoti he tathaa ek chakra ke rup main kaary karti he
 This cycle was first studied by Hans Adolf Kreb, who named it the Krebs cycle
 is kriya kaa pratham kriyafal citric amla he atah is kriya ko citric amla chakra bhi kehete hai
 Citric acid has 3 carboxylic radicals present, hence it is also known as tri carboxylic cycle or TCA cycle
 crebs chakra kii chakree pratikriyaaon main piruvik amla ke purna upachan se puure chakra main teen sthanon par carbon dioxide kaa ek ek anu baahar nikalataa he, arthath piruvik amla ke teenon carbon parmaanu teen anu carbon dioxide ke rup man baahar nikalate hai
 Pyruvic acid reacts with oxaloacetic acid during the Kreb cycle of respiration
 isamen teen sah-anzim kaam aate hai
 First the pyruvic acid oxidizes in the presence of an enzyme and turns into carbon dioxide and hydrogen
 hydrogen dydrogen grahi enedy ke saath sanyukt hokar enediech tu banaata he tathaa carbon dioxide gas vayumandal main mukt ho jaati he
 In the presence of many respiratory enzymes, the hydrogen present in NADH 2 is converted to water and released energy consisting of oxygen
 yah urja edipi se milakar atipi ke rup main sanchit ho jaati he
 Complete oxidation of one molecule glucose results in the formation of 38 molecule ATP
 atipi urja kaa bhandar he jise urja kii mudra bhi kehete hai
 The energy stored in ATP is decomposed as required by the organisms and the energy is released in which various biological functions of the organisms are conducted
 anaksic shwasan main oxygen kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati he tathaa yah oxygen kii anupasthiti main hota he
 In this process, there is incomplete oxidation of food
 jantuon main is kriya ke falswaroop carbon daai-oxide tathaa lactic amla kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa paudhon main carbon daai-oxide tathaa ithyle alcohol banataa he evam bahut kam maatra main urja mukt hoti he
 This type of respiration occurs in some low-grade plants, yeast, bacteria, and endangered parasites such as roundworms, laceworms, monocystis, etc
 kuch vishesh paristhitiyon main ucch shrenee ke jantuon, paudhon ke utakon, bijon, rasadaar falon aadi main bhi oxygen kii anupasthiti main hota he
 This respiration occurs when the muscles of humans or high-grade organisms are exhausted
 jin jeevadhariyon main yah shwasan hota he use anerobs kehete hai
 Similar to oxy respiration, glycolysis takes place at the beginning of anoxic respiration, at the end of which pyruvic acid is formed
 aage kii prakriya main oxygen ke abhaav main piruvik amla kaa purna oxikaran nahin ho paata he atah is shwasan main oxic shwasan kii tulana main bahut kam urja utpann hoti he
 In plants, this pyruvic acid is converted to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide in the presence of carboxylase enzyme
 iske baad acitaldihide dihydroginej injim kii upasthiti main NADH2 dwaara avakrut hokar NAD tathaa ithyle alcohol main parinat ho jaataa he
 In the absence of oxygen in the muscles of animals and some bacteria, the pyruvic acid produced at the end of glycolysis is converted to lactic acid with the help of NADH2
 kinvan anaksi shwasan kii ek vishisht rasinic kriya he
 It involves the decomposition of complex organic compounds into simple compounds in the presence of micro-organisms and enzymes
 kinvan kii kriya khamir, lactobasilas tathaa ankurit bijon aadi main hoti he
 The process of fermentation can be divided mainly into two parts - alcoholic fermentation and acidic ferment
 alcoholic kinvan kii kriya main glucose kaa vighatan ithyle alcohol tathaa carbon daai-oxide main hota he tathaa kuch urja mukt hoti he
 It occurs in Ist and sprouted seeds etc
 jiimage ek injim he jo east ke dwaara utpann hota he
 Acidic fermentation occurs in bacteria and muscles
 isamen amlon kaa nirmaan hota he
 It also has economic significance
 isaki sahaayta se madiraa, sirka, dahi aadi kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa shilp udyog main rasinic padaarthon kaa utpaadan hota he
 In respiration, the volume of carbon dioxide that exits and the amount of oxygen absorbed is called the respiratory quotient
 yah sadaiv sankhya main nirupit kiya jaataa he jaise- 6CO2 / 6O2 = 1shwasan bhagfal se is baat kaa sanket miltaa he ki shwasan kii kriya main kis prakaar ke khadyapadaarth kaa upchayan ho rahaa he, kyonki yah anupaat vibhinn khadyapadaarthon ke upchayan main vibhinn hota he
 Its value is greater than the unit, less than the unit, depending on the foods used in respiration
 jab shwasan kii kriya main upachayit honevaala khadyapadaarth carbohydrate hota he tab shwasan bhagfal kaa maan ikai hota he, jaise ankurit genhun ke bijon main
 When the food substance used in respiration is fat or protein, the value of the respiratory quotient is less than one unit
 2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O + urja Respiratory coefficient values can range from 0
4 to 0
9 when a food substance is used in respiration
 yadi hamen RQ kaa maan gyaat ho to is baat kaa anumaan laga sakate hai ki shwasan kii kriya main kis prakaar ke khadyapadaarth kaa upchayan ho rahaa he
 In the process of photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the presence of light and release oxygen gases into the atmosphere
 jisase vaataavaran main oxigen kii sandrata kaa bad janaa tathaa carbon daai-oxide kaa kam hona swaabhaavik hota he, parantu vastav main aisa nahin hota he
 In respiration, the living organisms consume oxygen gases at all times of the day and night and discard carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere
 is prakaar shwasan kriya dwaara vaataavaran main oxigen evam carbon daai-oxide gaison kaa santulan bana rahata he
 Respiration is an energy-releasing process
 shwasan kii kriya main bhojya padaarthon kaa oxikaran hota he, jisase unamem sanchit urja mukt hoti he
 During respiration, some part of the free energy is stored as ATP in the cell's mitochondria
 atipi ke rup main sanchit yah urja bhavishya main sajiv jeevadhariyon ke vibhinn jaivik kriyaayon ke sanchaalan main prayukt hoti he
 The released thermal energy helps to balance the body temperature of living organisms
 kuch kiton tathaa samudri jantuon ke sharir se prakaash utpann hota he
 It is a metamorphic form of energy generated by respiration
 kuch samudri jeevon jaise- electric-re machhlee tathaa tarpeado aadi kaa sharir aatm-raksha ke liye vidyutiya tarange utpann karata he, yah vidyut shwasan dwaara utpann urja ke roopaantaran se utpann hota he
 Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary and opposite to each other
 prakaash-sanshleshan main carbon daai-oxide or jal ke bich rasinic kriya ke falswaroop glucose kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxigen mukt hoti he
 Oxidation of glucose in respiration results in the formation of water and carbon dioxide
 prakaash-sanshleshan ek rachanaatmak kriya he iske falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main vruddhi hoti he
 Respiration is a nasal activity, which results in a decrease in the dry weight of living organisms
 prakaash-sanshleshan main saurya urja ke prayog se bhojan banataa he, vikiran urja kaa roopaantaran rasinic urja main hota he
 While the oxidation of food in respiration releases energy, the chemical energy stored in the food is used lively in its various functions
 is prakaar ye donon kriyaayein apane kachche maal ke liye ek duusare ke ant padaarthon par nirbhar rahete hue ek duusare kii poorak hoti hai
 Bio-chemical activities take place in every cell in the body of living organisms
 in kriyaaon ke sampaadan hetu dainik urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The main source of energy is food
 saura urja bhojan main sthitij urja ke rup main sanchit rahati he
 The main substance of respiration in respiration is the complete or incomplete oxidation of glucose in the presence or absence of oxygen, as a result of which the potential energy stored in the food is released as kinetic energy, thereby releasing the energy required to carry out the daily activities of life
 And there is fulfillment
 shwasan main oxikaran ke liye aavashyak glucose, poshan ke madhya hi nirmit hota he
 The energy required for nutrition is derived from the energy produced in respiration
 is prakaar shwasan tathaa poshan ek-duusare se abhinn rup se sambandhit he
 Most of the lifespan method of living respiration is dependent on ATP formation through cellular respiration, but anaerobic respiration first developed during evolution
 vatanirpekshi shwasan ke sarvapratham viksit hone kaa kaaran prithvi ke vayumandal main oxygen gas kii anuplabdhta thi
 4
6 billion years ago, the main gases in the Earth's atmosphere were carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water vapor and hydrogen sulfide
 isi vaataavaran main 3
5 billian varsh pehle pratham koshikeey sajiv kii utpatti hui
 These were prokaryotes
 inaki koshikeey sanrachana atyant saral thi
 Since there was no independent oxygen in the atmosphere, anaerobic process of respiration developed in these living organisms that did not require oxygen
 iske baad kareeb 1 billian varsh tak yahi prokariots prithvi par raaj karte rahe
 In it, photosynthesis was done to make its own food
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main surya ke prakaash kii upasthiti main carbon daai-oxide or jal kii sahaayta se carbohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxygen gas mukt hoti he
 The volume of this released oxygen gradually increased in the atmosphere
 oxygen kii upasthiti main sajiv koshikaon main shwasan kii ek nai vidhi kaa vikaas hua jisamen adhik atipi utpann ho sakati thi
 By this method cells started to generate more energy than before
 isse unka aakaar badhane laga evam saral prokariots se jatil eukariotic jeevon kaa kram-vikaas hua
 From these eukaryotic organisms, the present-day algae, fungi, plants and animals have developed in which cellular respiration is highly developed
 yadi koshikeey shwasan kaa jaev-vikaas nahin hua hota to shaayad aaj bhi pracheen prokariotic jeevon kaa dharti par raaj hota
 The table presented briefly describes the complete mechanism of cellular respiration

 The file is durable in that it exists for use by other programs even after the current program has finished
 sanganak sanchikaon ko paaramparik rup se daphtaron or pustakaalayon ke filon main maujuud kagaz ke dastavezon kaa aadhunik rup mana ja saktaa he, isiilie angrezi main iskaa naam fil padaa he
 At the lowest level, many modern operating systems consider files to be only a series of one-dimensional bytes
 adhik ucch str par, jab sanchika kii saamagree ko bhi maddenzar rakhaa ja rahaa ho, to ye dwilvie ank purna, akshar, chhavi pixel, dhwani yaa kisi or chiz kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue maane ja sakate hai
 It is up to the program to use the file how it interprets the file and understand the internal settings of the information so that it can present the same information in a more meaningful style to the user
 kisi bhi samay par sanchika kaa ek aakaar hoga, aamtaur par yah biton main abhivyakt kiya jaataa he or yah darshata he ki is sanchika ne bhandar main kitni jagah gheri hui he
 In most modern operating systems this size can be any nonnegative integer, but will have a maximum limit according to the system
 lekin sanchika kii saadhaaran paribhaasha yah lazimi nahin tehraati he ki uske maujuuda aakaar kaa koi vaastavik arth ho, sivaay us maamle main jab sanchika kii saamagree, ek drudh sangrah ke samooh ke andar kii kuch saamagree ho
 For example, in a Unix-like system, the file to which the link to / bin / ls points is defined and rarely changed
 isaki tulana / dev / null se karen to yah bhi ek sanchika he par iskaa aakaar hameshaa badalata rahata he balki shaayad us tarah myne hi nahin rakhata he jaise pichley udhaaharan kaa myne rakhata he
 The information and small information contained in a computer file can be in the form of bundles or can also be movable
 yah maatr sanchika ke rachanaakaar par nirbhar he ki usamen jaankaree kaa aayojan kis prakaar kiya jayega
 For this reason, many low-standard file structures exist that can serve any purpose, from the simplest to the most complex
 adhiktar sanganak sanchikaon kaa istemaal sanganak kaarykram karte hai
 These programs create, change and delete the appropriate files for their use
 jo kaarykram-nirmaataa in kaaryakramon ko banaate hai, vahi faisalaa karte hai ki koun si filon kii zarurat he, unka istemaal kaise hona he or unke naam bhi ve nirdhaarit karte hai
 In some cases, computers manipulate program files in such a way that they are visible to the computer user
 udhaaharan ke liye shabd-sansaadhan carkram main prayokta dastauez sanchikaon main badlaav karte hai or prayokta khud hi unhen naam bhi dete hai
 The contents of the document file are organized in such a way that the word-processing program understands it, but the user determines its name and storage address, and the key information of storage is also determined by the user
 kai anuprayog sabhi saamagree sanchikaon ko ek hi sanchika main ghused dete hai or alag alag prakaar kii jaankaree kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye andar hi nishaan laga ke rakhte hai
 Content files from games like Doom and Quake are an example of this
 sanganak par, sanchikaon ko bananaa, badalanaa, badhanaa, chota karnaa, sthanantarit karnaa or mitaanaa sambhav he
 In most cases, all this is done by running computer programs on the computer, but the user of the computer can also make changes to files if needed
 udhaaharan ke liye, microsoft verde kii sanchikaaye aamtaur par prayokta ke nirdeshon ke aadhaar par microsaft verde kaarykram dwaara banaai jaati hai, lekin prayokta in sanchikaon ko sidhe hi windos explorer jaise kisi sanchika prabandhak kaarykram ke jariye bhi hataa, mitaa yaa sthanantirit kar saktaa he
 In unix-like systems, user-zone processes usually do not directly connect to files; The operating system provides a segregation level that allows almost all transactions with files from the user-area to occur through hard links
 kathor kadiyon ke jariye kisi sanchika kaa naam diya ja saktaa he ; vishuddh rup se prachaalan pranali main sanchikaon ke naam nahin hote hai
 For example, user-area programs cannot delete a file, they can only delete a link to that file, and if the linker finds that the file no longer has any other links, it can delete this file
 Can be erased
 vastav main keval ashthi hi sanchikaon se len-dein karata he, par prayokta-kshetra ke anurodhon kaa sanchikaon ke jariye is tarah hota he ki prayokta-kshetra kaaryakramon ko yah agyaat hi rahata he
 While the transaction of programs with files varies according to the operating system and file system, mainly these activities are common: aadhunik sanganak pranaaliyon main sanchikaon tak pahunchne ke liye aamtaur par filanaamon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In some operating systems, this name is associated with the file
 kuch anya main sanchika swayan benaam hoti he, par namit kadiyaan uski ore ingit karti hai
 In this case, the user can only recognize the link as the file name, but this will not be true, especially when the same file has more than one link
 sanchikaaye nirdeshikaon main ho sakati hai
 But it would be better to say that the directory can contain a list of files or a list of links to files
 is paribhaasha ke antargat yah samajhnaa bahut zaruri he ki "sanchika" shabd main nirdeshikas bhi shaamil hai
 This makes staging of directories possible, ie subdirectories inside directories
 jo naam kisi nirdeshika ke andar kisi sanchika ko sanderbhit karata he, use anokhaa hona zaruri he
 But some operating systems also specify a type with a name, which makes it possible to have two different types of files in a directory with the same name, such as a directory and a file of the same name
 jin paryaavarnon main sanchikaaye namit hoti hai, unamem, sanchika ke naam va path kii jodi anokhi honi zaruri he - koi bhi do sanchikaon kaa naam va path dono kisi or sanchika ke naam va path se mail nahin kha sakate hai
 Where the file is anonymous, named references will reside under a namespace
 adhiktar baar kisi bhi namasthaan main maujuud naam thik ek yaa shunya sanchikaon ko sanderbhit karegaa
 However, any file can be referenced in a namespace with zero, one or more names
 anuprayog ke prasang ke anusaar, kisi bhi sanchika yaa kadi ke liye upyukt naam kinhin khaas aksharon se bani hogi
 The computer system depends on whether the name is appropriate or not
 praarambhik sanganak kisi sanchika ke naam main simit akshar va ankon kii anumati dete the, lekin aadhunik sanganak lambey naam rakhane dete hai jinamein lagbhag kisi bhi kram main unicode akshar yaa unicode ank ho sakate hai, taaki ek hi nazar main sanchika kaa makasad samaj aa jaae
 Some computer systems allow empty spaces in file names, some do not
 sanchika naamon kii laghuderghakshar samvedansheeltaa sanchika pranali dwaara nirdhaarit hoti he
 Unix file systems are typically short-term and allow user-level applications to create files that contain only short and long letters
 microsoft windos kai sanchika pranaliyaan pradaan karata he, jinamein lugh-deergh samvedansheeltaa kii nitiyaan alag alag hai
 If the user uses a disk editor to change file names in directory entries, then the prevalent FAT system may contain many files whose names differ only by capitalization
 lekin, aamtaur par prayokta anuprayog isaki anumati nahin dete hai
 Most computers organize files based on steps and use folders, directories or catalogs for this
 shabd jo bhi ho vichaar ek hi he
 Each folder may contain some number of files and may contain other folders
 in anya folderon ko upfolder kehete hai
 These may contain more files and folders, etc
, etc
, by creating a tree-like structure containing a "master folder" or under which any number of files and folders can be
 folderon ke bhi sanchikaon kii tarah naam ho sakate hai 
 It is easy to organize files logically through folders
 jab bhi koi sanganak folderon kaa istemaal karata he to harek sanchika va folder kaa keval apana naam hi nahin apitu ek path bhi hota he jo yah darshata he ki vah sanchika yaa folder kis folder yaa folderon main maujuud he
 In this path, a special mark - such as / - is written between the file or folder names
 udhaaharan ke liye is lekh main die udhaaharan main, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers yah darshata he ki Managers naamak ek sanchika, Salaries naamak folder main he, r yah folder Payroll main he
 There is a forward line between the file and folder names, the topmost or root folder has no name, so the name starts with a forward line
 kai sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon me vistaaron kaa istemaal karte hai, inhen sanchika prakaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Windows computers, the extension takes the form of a dot after the name of the file and a few characters before the point, these characters are the type of file identified
 
txt vistaar paathya sanchika kaa pahchaan he, 
doc vistaar kisi dastauez kaa pahchaan he, khaastaur par microsoft verde sanchika praaroop main; aadi ityadi
 Even when extensions are used on the computer system, there is considerable diversity in the extent to which the computer system recognizes and behaves according to them, in some systems they are indispensable, while in others they are also present
 It does not matter, they are ignored
 kai aadhunik sanganak pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko nuksaan pahunchne se rokane ke tareeke pradaan karti he
 Computers that allow more than one user also enforce file permissions to control which files and folders can be created, deleted, or changed
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi prayokta ko ek sanchika ko badalane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin, yaa phir sanchikaaye va folder banane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin
 It can also be determined through permissions that only a few users can see the contents of a file or folder
 anumatiyon ke jariye sanchikaon main maujuud saamagree ke avaidh badlaav yaa vinaash se bachaav hota he or nijee jaankaree ko gopneey rakhane ke liye avaidh prayoktaaon ko kuch sanchikaaye dekhne se roka ja saktaa he
 Many computers have another rescue method known as "read only mark"
 yah chihn lage hone par sanchiko kaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he par badla nahin ja saktaa he
 This sign is useful for critical information that should not be changed or erased, such as for certain files used by internal components of a computer system
 kuch pranaliyaan ek "chhipi hui chihn" bhi shaamil karti hai, jo yah sunishchit karata he ki sanchika adrishy ho jaae
 With this symbol, the computer system hides important system files that should not be changed by users
 uparokt charchaa main sanchika kaa varnan ek ucch stareey prachaalan pranali yaa prayokta ke liye ek pariklpana ke taur par hua he
 However, any file must be physically present to be truly workable
 arthath, ek sanchika kii amoort avadharana ko vaastavik sanganak pranali main vaastavik bhautik rup main hona aavashyak he, anyathaa uskaa aastitiv hona na hona baraabar he
 Physically, most computer files are stored in some kind of content storage device
 udhaaharan he hard jisk, jiske jariye adhiktar prachaalan pranaliyaan chalati hai
 Most of the files are kept in these
 21veen sadi ke praarabdh main hard discs sarvaadhik uplabdh gaiyr vaashpashil bhandaaran upkaran he
 If the files contain only temporary contents, they can be stored in RAM
 unics jaisi prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchikaon kaa kisi bhautik bhandaaran upkaran se sidhaa vaasta nahin hota he: / dev / null iskaa ek pramukh udhaaharan he, isi tarah / dev, / proc or / sys ke antarangat maujuud lagbhag sabhi sanchikaaye bhi isi prakaar kii hai
 They can be used as files in the user area

 Computer files can be stored in magnetic strips
 kuch sthitiyon main sanchikaon ko anya madhyamon main bhi bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he jaise ki lekhneey kampact discs, ankiy bahuvid discs, zip drive, yuasabi flash drive aadi
 When the computer files contain very important information, the copying process tries to avoid the consequences in situations where the files can be lost
 sanchikaon kii pratilipi karne kaa matlab bas yahi he ki sanchikaon kii pratiyaan kisi anya sthaan par baan ke rakhana taaki yadi mul sanganak ko kuch ho jaataa he yaa ve galati se mit jaati hai to prati ke jariye unhen waapas paaya ja sake
 There are several ways to copy files
 adhiktar sanganak pranaliyaan suvidhaatmak kaarykram pradaan karte hai jo ki prati rakhane kii prakriya main suvidha pradaan karte hai, kyonki yadi bahut si sanchikaon kii pratiyaan rakhni hai to isamen bahut samay lag saktaa he
 Files are often copied to transferable mediums such as writable cds or cartridge tapes
 ek hi sanganak kii duusari hard discs main sanchikaon ko pratilipit karne se ek discs ke kharaab hone se to bachaav ho jaataa he par yadi puure sanganak ke kharaab yaa nasht hone ke jokhim se bachaav karnaa he to un sanchikaon kii pratiyaan aise madhyam main karnaa zaruri he jo is sanganak se dur le ja ke kisi surakshit jagah par bhandaarit kii ja sake
 The grand-father-son copy method automatically creates three copies, the oldest copy of the file being the grandfather file and the son existing copy
 kis sanganak dwaara sanchikaon ko yojit, namit, bhandaarit va parivartit karne kii pranali ko uski sanchika pranali kaha jaataa he
 Most operating systems have at least one file system
 kai prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchika pranaliyaan ek saath chalaai ja sakati he
 For example, newer MS Windows computers support older fat-style file systems of MS-DOS, as well as NTFS, the popular file system of the latest Windows versions
 har pranali ke apane faayde nuksaan hai
 For example, in standard FAT, only 8-letter file names run, whereas NTFS contains possible long file names that may contain spaces
 aap kisi sanchika ko antiatioes main Payroll records jaisaa naam de sakate hai lekin effeti main yah naam kuch payroll
dat jaisaa hi ho saktaa he 
 File manager programs are convenient programs through which files and folders can be moved, created, deleted, or renamed, but they do not actually allow you to read or add content to the file
 har sanganak pranali apni mul sanchika pranali ke liye kam se kam ek sanchika prabandhak pradaan karata he
 The most commonly used file manager program in Windows is Windows Explorer and on Mac it is Finder

 Their ancestors were originally Telugu-speaking high-profile Panchadravida Vellanadu Brahmins from Telangana, who came to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and other provinces of North India at the insistence and invitation of the North Indian kings and emperors to occupy the posts of vice-chancellor, Rajguru, Dharampeeth, etc

 After Shrimad Bhagwat, Shivanand Goswami is credited with writing the most prolific text singh-siddhanta-sindhu
 " Among the great men whose contribution to the creation of India's glorious and varied cultural-history has been memorable - among them the strong culture of seventeenth-century Telang Brahmin, philosopher-poet tantra-chudamani Shivanand Goswami as a strong link to the long scholarly tradition of Andhra Pradesh
 And literary contribution is very important
 According to the description of the North Indian andhra-tailang-bhatt-family tree, "in the Atreya gotra of the Tailang Brahmins, there was the original ancestor Srivayenkatesha Ananamma in the Taittriya Aastambha of the Yaturveda" - in whose sixth generation was born in the family of Jagannivasji such a remarkable scholar as Shivanand Goswami

 Historical Sanskrit texts - 'muhurtratna' and 'sanheda Aryasaptashti' have some kind of 'kavitamya' introduction of the Dravidian clan of Shivanand - "panampatta on the banks of the holy river Penna, destroying all sins in the 'dravidian' region in the south of India
 In the family of Atreya gotra residing in the city, he was a scholar of knowledge of Agam Nigam Mystery and veda-vedang / Gon, who was a scholar
 Many scholars of the time had 'defeated' them and received their discipleship
 Jagannivasji, who was born in this family of Yashopataka of the same Atreya clan, spread across rivers and seas, was invited by the King of Bundelkhand and received 'initiation' from them
 The king became his disciple
 The same great scholar Jagannivasji had three sons - Srisiromani Bhatt, Sreejanardan and Srichakrapani
 " 'saheeda Aryasaptashati' shivanandji ke pitamah shri shrinivas bhatta dakshin se aaye the
 In his youth, he took the initiation of Tantrashastra and 'srividya' from Deshikendra Sachchidananda Sundaracharya, a Manish of the Dravidian region, who was the ruler of jalandhar-peetha - the Guru then gave him the title of 'goswami' in Samvat 1630
 diksha ke uparaant inkaa nayaa naam goswami vidyanandnath padaa| lalita kii archa main, shrividya main nirat ho jane se inhen kaa teesraa naam lalitanandanath goswami bhi he
 Therefore, among these Atreyya Brahmins from Telangana, 'goswami' is not a caste word, a title given to scholarship

 Classical texts such as the Srimad Bhagavat Maha Purana and the 'mahabharata' are the result of the combined long-form writing tradition of many sages-scholars, as Ved Vyasa is not the name of a single individual, an 'academic post' assumed by various scholars from time to time
 ) But a single writer has prepared such a huge manuscript, it is rare to find such a unique example in the literary history of Sanskrit

 The truth is that in which year and where he was born, it is a matter of research
 is kaa kaaran keval yah he ki puraane jamaane main mahaan se mahaan lekhak tak apane nijee-jivan ke bare main koi soochna yaa jaankaree apni kritiyon main aksar nahin dete the
 In that era, to remain completely secret or unaware and to engage in high level silent saraswat-sadhana would have been the internal psychopathy of many scholars like Shivanand ji
 aisa anumaan bahuprachlit he ki anek nareshon ke sammanit kulguru hone ke baavjood, apana antim samay goswamiji ne bikaner ke maharaja anupasingh ke aagrah par unke saath hi vyateet kiya
 But where Shivanand Goswami died - somewhere in South India, or in Bikaner - is a matter of research
 shivanand goswami chanderi ke governor devisingh bundela ke samakaleen the, jinhone goswamiji se 'mantra-diksha' lekar bhent main kuch gaanvon kii jaagir bakshi thi
 Similarly, the seventh generation king of Orchha, Devi Singh, was impressed by his scholarship and gave a jagir of 4 villages

 It was here that in 1922, the famous Sanskrit litterateur Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri was married to Ramadevi Bhatt, the daughter of Acharya Gopikrishna Goswami of Srimad Bhagwat, a descendant of Shivanandji

 He stayed in Bikaner in the evening of his life
 sambhawatah inkaa dehavsaan bhi vahiin hua ho- kintu inke antim dinon ke bare main koi aitihaasik saamagree uplabdh nahin hoti| After Shivanand ji, his sons also continued to achieve many achievements in royalty, keeping their clan tradition intact, as evidenced by the following English document- 'maharaj shri Shivanandji, sole ascendant, gave purnabhishek-mantra to Maharaja Shri Anoop Singh ji Bahadur of Bikaner at Dilsuri 
 The Maharaja bequeathed two villages CHIKLOI and POOLASAR in Bhent on this most auspicious occasion to Shri Shivanandji Maharaj, the Rajguru
 Thus Goswami Paramsukhji Maharaj, the youngest son of great Shri Shivanandji Maharaj settled at Bikaner on the request of HH Shri Gajsingh ji Bahadur,the Maharaja of Bikaner
 Shri Suratsinghji, Maharaja of Bikaner also accepted Purnabhishek Mantra from Goswami Shri Paramsukhji Maharaj, the Rajguru, in 1855 AD and bequeathed the village KHETOLAI in Bhent and bequeathed on the most auspicious occasion of the sacred thread ceremony of Bishwnathji and kanhaiyalalji, real sons of shri Paramsukhji Goswami, village SURJANSAR devisingh ke darbari vidvan unke viruddh anek prakaar ke pravaad unki anupasthiti main bana kar raja ke kaan bharte rahete the| yah baat to sarvavidit thi ki orchha yaa bundelon ke isht devtaa, bhagwaan ram the or isi kaaran is kshetra main anek ram or hanuman mandiron kii sthapana bhi hui he, vaise orchha main hi bundelon ke isht hanumanji kaa ek mandir aaj bhi he| yah mandir shivanandji ke ashram or devisingh ke mehalon ke bich padataa tha
 The scholars of Shivanand complained to the king that the temple of the presiding deity of Bundelkhand, while on the way, never bowed down to his guru, the presiding deity
 When King Devisingh himself presented the same thing in front of them, he avoided it in humor, saying that "this matter is of personal reverence and since i am absorbed in the feeling of Ahornish Devi, therefore going into the 'other' sense in it Mine and yours will be evil! All gods are the form of God anyway
 

 " inke uttar se raja kadaachit puri tarah santusht nahin ho sakaa
 So once both of them were coming through the path of the same Hanuman temple, the king begged them to bow down to their favorite Hanuman
 kehete hai- jaise hi shakti ke param aradhak shivanandji ne apane haath pranaam hetu uthaae, usase purv hi hanumanji kii murti main pathar fatne kii awaz ke saath upar se neeche tak ek gahari daraar pads gayi! raja is chamatkaar se bahut bhaybheet ho gaya
 And since then, a deep loyalty to Adyashakti has also awakened in his mind
 orchha main hanuman mandir main aaj bhi vah gahari daraar dekhi ja sakati he
 


 After this incident, Shivanand Goswami's mind became somewhat unsympathetic to the learned politicians and devout politicians in the court on the strength of miracles
 unhone "sankshep-praayshchitt" or "vyavhaar-nirnay" jaise granth likh kar apane isht ke samaksh praayshchitt kiya
 


 " aurangzeb shashan ke dauraan amer ke rajya par aaye rajnatik-sankaton ke nivaaran ke liye jaipur ke tatkaaleen panditon ne maharaja vishnusingh ko nagar main shanti banaaye rakhane ke liye 'vaajapeya-yajna' karwaane kaa mashvira diya tha
 Then some pandits of Kashi and Mithila were very famous for their cultivation and siddhis
 amer ke naresh ne unhen hi is kaam ke liye jaipur aamantrit kiya
 But whenever there was a veela of Purnahuti in that royal Vajpayee-yajna due to misuse, the sacrificial priest would die accidentally
 This happened many times, not once
 ek ke baad ek kaashi-mithila ke paanch siddh purohit yajna puraa karaane se purv hi kaal-kavlit ho gaye
 Seeing such a terrible vengeance, the king sent a message through Bikaner King Anupsinh to Orchha Maharaj that he should kindly send his vice-chancellor and the great Tantric Shivanandji to Jaipur so that he can get the vajpayee-yajna done
 Shivanand Goswami finally reached Amer in 1680 AD and near the Jalmahal, he completed the vajpayee-yajna of Jaipur King uninterrupted
 The night before Purnahuti, it is said that a formidable Brahmarakshas appeared before Goswamiji in a dream - who challenged him to debate with the information that the earlier five kashi-pandits had become his grasps by defeating him in debate
 goswamiji ne brahmarakshas kii is chunauti ko sweekaar kiya or use shastrarth main haraa kar vaajapeya-yajna purnahuti ke saath vidhivat sampann karaayaa| But to disguise the fact that the first five kashi-pandits had defeated the Brahmarakshas in scripture and become his morsels, the king returned to Mahapura from Amber without any alms from Amber Maharaja
 It is said that when Maharaja Vishnusinh sensed Shivanandji's displeasure, he persuaded himself to reach Mahapura with his son Sawai Jai Singh
 Shivanandji, while making some very accurate predictions about Sawai Jai Singh, instructed the Maharaja that he go to some well-known ritualist Pandit and send Kashi for the 'pratamukti' of Brahmarakshas
 He somewhat unhappily held the Maharaja responsible for the killing of the five Pandits, He would have been advised to get Ashwamedha Yagya done as a result of citing many ancient scriptures
 Being distressed by the death of innocent Brahmins, he also showed humility in front of Maharaja in Mahapura and reluctance to stay
 Goswamiji eventually relinquished the estate of five villages to his younger brother, Maharaja Anupsingh as Rajguru of Bikaner "after some time" - whose invitation / request to be Bikaner vice-chancellor-rajguru has been pending with him ever since

 yahan yah jaananaa aavashyak he kii, united kingdom yaa rashtramandal yaa kisi bhi rashtramandal pradesh kii aadhikarik shabdaawalee main "realm" ek vaidhik yaa kanoonee shabd nahin he, arthath "realm" kii koi kanoonee paribhaasha nahin he
 Therefore, there is no obligation that these states under the British sovereign be addressed by any special name, nor does the term "realm" define any particular status of a state
 haalaanki, 1950 ke dashak se hi, british samprabhu ke raaj ke adheen aanevaale rajyon ko rashtramandal ke anya sadsy deshon se vibhakt rup se bodh karne hetu "realm" shabd kaa upyog adhikaarak dastavezon main kiya jaataa rahaa he, yahan tak kii rani elizabeth ke rajasidhaaran kii ghoshnaa main bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These states are called realms because, despite being under the same ruler, all these states are completely universal, and completely independent from each other, so it is not part of 16 countries, one political unit, but 16 There are different states
 kyonki, reyalm ek kanoonee shabd nahin he, isiilie iskaa koi aadhikarik anuwaad bhi upasthit nahin he
 Therefore, to understand these states, any word that makes sense of the land under a king can be used
 saadhaaran taurapar, prajabhumi, pradesh, or paribhumi jaise shabdon kaa prayog hota he, inke alaava, pramandal or rajbhumi shabdon kaabhi upyog ho saktaa he
 According to the present situation, since the year 1992, there are a total of 16 Commonwealth tribes in the world, with a total area of 1,87,00,000 square kilometers, and a population of 14,30,00,000
 jisame se 6 sabase adhik aabaad desh hai:united kingdom, canda, australia, newzealand or jamaica
 The system of Rajmukut or The Crown is a special political concept, which has a very important role in the legal and political system of Britain and other Commonwealth territories
 is soch kaa vikaas england rajya main samantvaadi kaal ke dauraan shabdic mukut tathaa rashtriya sampadaaon ko samprabhu tathaa unke / unki vyaktigat sampatti se vibhakt kar sambodhit karne hetu hua tha
 According to this view, the Rajmukut is seen as a symbol of state and governance in all aspects of administration and in every dimension, and the British sovereign is seen as a continuous incarnation of the Rajmukut
 atah britain tathaa rashtramandal pradeshon me is shabdaawalee ko shashan athwa sarkaar ke liye ek upalakshan ke rup main bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, yaa sidhe-sidhe aisa bhi kaha ja saktaa he kii yah rajtantr ko hi sambodhit karne kaa ek doosraa tarika he
 Legally, "rajmukut" can be defined as an individual institution which is the entire judicial embodiment of the legislature, executive and judiciary
 atah is sandarbh main is shabd ko kisi shahi poshaak ke vaastavik mukut ke saath sambhramit nahin karnaa chahie
 As an institution, the Rajmukut is the oldest functioning institution in Britain's political system
 prayek rashtramandal pradesh main rajmukut kii sankalpana saamaan, parantu vibhakt vidhik sankalpanaayen hai
 Therefore, in Commonwealth law, judicial documents to distinguish one jurisdiction from another, "crown the right 


" Example: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom 


" or "la Couronne du chef du Québec "also the Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, etc
, and because, Canada and Australia are federal nations, so each Canadian province and Australian state" Rajmukut "
 mukut ke adhikaron ko yaa adhirat dwaara swayan yaa phir unke pratinidhi dwaara, sambandhit mantriyon yaa adhikariyon kii salaah par prayog kiya jaataa he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions, including the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701 and the Act of Union, 1707
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament
 antim baar jab kisi shaasha ko anaichhik rup se nishkashit kiya gaya tha, wo tha 1688 main james saptam or dwitiya jinhen glorious revolution ke samay nishkashit kiya gaya tha
 The Act of Settlement, 1701, limits the succession to the legally Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I
 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 According to the Acts of Settlement of 1701, only the "legitimate" Protostant descendants of Sophia, the granddaughter of James I, the granddaughter of Hanover, were able to inherit the throne
 arthath, shahi parivaar ke vansh ke keval jaays santan hi singhasana par uttaradhikaar kaa haq rakhte hai, or koi bhi avaidh santan, tathaa unke vanshaj, singhasana par kisi bhi prakaar kaa adhikaar nahin rakhte hai
 In this context, according to the provisions of the Royal Marriage Act, 1772, any member of the royal family is required to obtain the sovereign's approval to marry, and any marriage done without the sovereign's approval shall be deemed "illegal", and The person and his children will be deprived of authority over the throne
 is adhinium ke praavdhaanon main 2013 ke saxeshan tu da crown act dwaara kuch parivartan laaye gaye
 According to the Act, the first six members of the succession order are required to obtain sovereign permission to marry, otherwise the person and all the progeny and descendants of that marriage will be deemed to be deprived of the succession order
 parantu aisi kisi bhi vivaah ko kisi bhi prakaar se gaiyr-kanoonee nahin qaraar ja saktaa he
 The group of the closest members of the sovereign's family is called the royal family
 haalaanki, aisa koi drudh niyam yaa vidhaan nahin he, jo yah suniyojit karata ho kii kin vyaktiyon ko is vishesh samooh main rakhaa jaae, naahi koi aisa vidhaan he jo rajpariwaar ko vistrut rup se paribhaashit karata ho
 Nonetheless, those individuals to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness are generally referred to are members of the royal family
 is maapdand ke aadhaar par raaj parivaar main, adhirat, unke / unki sahachaari, purv samprabhu kii vidhwaa / vidhurgan, wales ke rajkumaar ke jyeshthatam putr ke santan, tathaa purv shaasha ke putron kii dharmapatniyaan yaa unki vidhwaayen or unke purush-rekha ke pautra shaamil honge
 In the context of different Commonwealth territories, different terminology can also be used for this particular group, for example, in Australia this group is called the Australian Royal Family and in Canada the Canadian Royal Family
 18 veen or 19veen sadi ke dauraan britain ke aupniveshik vistaar dwaara, britain ne vishwa ke anya anek bhu-bhaagon ve kshetron par apana kabza jamaa liya
 Most of the countries achieved independence from Britain by the mid-20th century
 haalaanki un sabhi deshon ne united kingdom kii sarkaar kii adhipatyata ko nakaar diya, parantu unamem se kai raashtra, british shaasha ko apane adhirat ke rup main manyata dete hai
 These countries are called Commonwealth Territories or Commonwealth Praja Bhumi
 varttman kaal main, united kingdom ke adhirat keval united kingdom ke hi nahin balki uske atirikt kul 15 anya rashtron ke adhirat bhi hai
 Although in these nations also they have almost the same rank and authority as in Britain, but in those countries, they have no real political or traditional duties, almost all the duties of the ruler as their representative fulfills the General Manager of that country
 
 britain kii sarkaar kaa rashtramandal pradeshon kii sarkaron ke kaary main koi bhi bhoomika yaa hastkshep nahin he
 Commonwealth countries other than Britain: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, St

 purvatah rashtron ke rashtramandal ke saare desh rashtramandal paribhumi ke hissaa hua karte the, parantu 1950 main bharat ne swatantraaa ke pashchaat swayan ko ganraajya ghoshit kiya, or british rajasatta kii rashtrapramukh ke rup main samprabhutaa ko bhi khatm kar diya
 But India retained the membership of the Commonwealth
 uske baad se, rashtramandal deshon main, british samprabhu ko "rashtramandal ke pramukh" kaa pad bhi diya jaataa he, jo rashtramandal ke sanghathan kaa nammaatr pramukh kaa pad he
