 Pope Gregory I
 pope greegari ko isai dharm kaa sarvopari netaa chune jane ke pehle roman sinetter kaa sammaan praapt tha
 While living in the field of politics, he must have earned fame and fame, but he considered it good to leave politics and join the field of religion
 san 590 main ye pope chune gaye
 Pope Gregory gave significant sum in the widespread propagation of Christianity
 england se roman jati ke hat jane ke baad vahaan isai dharm kaa lop hone laga tha
 The new English caste had begun to migrate from Germany and worshiped many deities
 isane aate hi england ke isai dharm ko nasht kar diya
 It is said that once Pope Gregory saw some British children being sold as slaves in the market of Rome
 in baalkon kii sundarataa se ye atyadhik prabhavit hue or nishchay kiya ki british dweep main jahaan roman kaal main isai dharm ko logon ne sweekaar kar liya tha, phir se is dharm kaa prachaar kiya jaay
 For the purpose of preaching, he sent a famous priest named Augustine to England who started preaching Christianity in the court of King Athalbert of Kent
 ethlbert ne france kii ek isai rajkumaari se shaadi kii thi, at: usne isai dharm sweekaar kar liya or augustin kaa kentrebari main girjaghar banane kii ajna de di
 Thus Pope Gregory's efforts resulted in the promotion of Christianity in England again
 pope greegari ne isai dharm ke sarvacch netaa ke rup main bade unche darje kii prashasnik pratibha kaa parichay diya
 Whether it was religious, they managed everything or related to the arrangement of the property of the church, they managed everything with ingenuity
 choti se choti baton kii ore bhi inhone vyaktigat dhyaan diya or puure isai jagat kii prashasnic aavashyaktaaon se parichit rahane kii cheshtaa kii
 His letters give a fair sense of his practical intelligence and administrative ability
 pope greegari ne dharmik granthon kii samiksha tathaa dharm sambandhi baton kii vaartalap ke rup main vivechna bhi kii
 In these works of Latin language, he has mostly used the metaphorical style for the representation of esoteric subjects
 shabd do arth rakhte hai; ek to upree jo spasht hota he or doosraa lakshanik jisase dharm sambandhi gudh vichaar bhi saralata se samaj main aa jate hai
 Pope Gregory preached the stories of Christian saints in place of pre-christian stories
 inhone jo kuch bhi likhaa, dharm ke vyapak prachaar kii bhaavana se likhaa
 His focus was on the clear expression of ideas, not style
 lekin phir bhi inaki bhashaa main saundarya or prabhaav he

 pehle sunami ko samudr main uthne vaale jowar ke rup main bhi liya jaataa rahaa he lekin aisa nahin he
 Actually, the waves in the sea arise from the effect of the moon sun and the gravity of the planets, but tsunami waves are different from these common waves
 11 / 03 / 2011 ko bhi yahi hua There are many reasons behind the tsunami waves but the most effective reason is earthquake
 Apart from this, tsunami waves also arise due to land subsidence, volcanic eruptions, some kind of eruption and sometimes meteor impact
 jab kabhi bheeshan bukamp kii vajah se samudr kii upree parat achaanak khisak kar aage bad jaati he to samudr apni samaantar sthiti main upar kii taraf badhane lagata he

 As the egg shell is hard, but the substance inside it is lit and wet
 bukamp ke asar se ye daraaren chaudee hokar andar ke padaarth main itani halchal paidaa karti hai ki wo tezi se upar kii taraf kaa rukh kar letaa he
 When the layers of the earth are also broadened by any effect, they move due to which continents are formed
 to is tarah ye sunami lehren banati hai
 But it is also not necessary that every earthquake causes tsunami waves
 iske liye bukamp kaa centre samudr ke andar yaa uske aasapaas hona zaruri he
 When these tsunami waves reach the shallow waters of any layer of any continent from which it is connected to another continent and can be seen as a crack
 vahaan sunami lahar kii tezi kam ho jaati he
 That is because the other continent is also joining at that place and due to the connected layer of earth there is a crack-like place which gives way to the water inside itself
 lekin uske baad bheetar ke pani ke saath mil kar jab sunami kinare kii taraf badhati he to usame itani tezi hoti he ki wo 30 meter tak upar uth sakati he or uske raste main chaahe ped, jangal yaa imaaraten kuch bhi aaen- sabakaa safaaya kar sakati he
 Tsunami waves attack the coastline in a horrific manner and can cause serious damage to life and property

 Wherever the plates or layers of the earth meet, there is a high risk of tsunami in the surrounding sea

 In equation form, is prakaar sabhi leptonon ko +1 aavantit kiya jaataa he, sabhi pratileptonon ko −1 or jo lepton nahin hai unki lepton sankhya 0 maani jaati he
 The lepton number is a summative quantum number, that is, the total lepton number is preserved in any interaction

 The film follows the journey of a young man named Raj Sharma, who meets three girls at different stages of their lives between 18 and 30 years: Mahi - a small-town girl from Punjab, Radhika - a Mumbai Model and Gayatri - a NRI taxi driver and student in Australia

 yatra ke dauraan switzaraland main ek stesan par utarane ke baad maahi kii train chhot jaati he
 Raj, who travels in the same train, sees this and gets off the train to lure him
 jahaan maahi bina paison ke asahaay khadi hoti he, raaj khud kii bhi train chhot jane kaa dhong karata he, usko santvanaa detaa he or uski vaapasi udaan se pehle, samay par hawaii adde pahunchane ke liye madad kii peshkash karata he
 On the way, Mahi falls in love with Raj

 Raj takes Mahi to the airport, where she meets her family and friends
 maahi un donon ke bich jo kuch bhi ghatit hota he, uske bare main apane doston ko bataati he
 When she opens the piece of paper on which Raj had written the poem, she finds it empty
 vah raaj kii talash main nikalati he or use apane doston ke saamne un donon ko lekar "anaap shanaap" shekhi baghaarte hue chhip kar sunati he, tathaa uski juthi baaten sun kar chaunk jaati he or uskaa dil tut jaataa he

 Here Raj narrates how he met his neighbor Radhika and was attracted to her
 raaj ko ek helo 3 game ke launch ke liye sidney sthanantarit hone kaa prastaav miltaa he
 He hopes to leave Radhika and adopt a new life, thinking that Radhika is a modern girl living with him and that she will manage herself even if the relationship breaks down
 However, Radhika unexpectedly declares that she is ready to abandon her career as a model to marry Raj and move to Australia with him
 rishta todane ke liye use majaboor karne main kai avasaron par asafal rahane ke baad, vah sidney ke liye us din udaan bharta he, jis din radhika ke saath shaadi honi thi, jisaki khabar register ke daphtar main raaj kii pratiksha karte hue radhika ko milti he

 Raj befriends him and learns that Gayatri, like him, does not believe in an institution like marriage
 baharhaal, use ehsaas hota he ki vah use pyaar karne laga he or akhirkaar vivaah kaa prastaav rakhata he
 Gayatri rejects her and walks away, saying that she is happy with whatever her life is cutting

 He decides to return to India apologizing to both of them
 apni vaapasi par, vah pehle maahi ke paas jaataa he
 Mahi is now married with two sons
 vah maahi ke pati joginder se miltaa he, jo pehle us par naaraaz hota he kyonki usne maahi kii bahan se uske bare main suna tha ki kaise maahi raaj se pyaar karne lagi thi or raaj ne uskaa dil todaa tha
 He also tells Raj that Mahi is the right housewife and the right mother for her children
 vah 15 saal pehle kaa vah samay bhi yaad karata he jab usne pehali baar maahi ko dekha tha
 Although Mahi is a good wife, she was afraid of love or romance
 raaj unke bich hastkshep karne kaa faisla karata he or maahi se kshamaa yachana karata he
 He also makes her realize how much her husband loves her and says that her husband is the real "raj" she is waiting for - the romantic who wants her wholeheartedly
 vah raaj ko maaf kar detii he or apane pati se pyaar kaa izhaar karti he
 After this Raj seeks Radhika
 jab vah use dhundh letaa he, to paata he ki radhika ne apana naam badal kar shreya rathod rakh liya he or ab vah ek behad safal or sampann supermodel he
 After much effort, he manages to meet her and apologizes to her
 shreya unki kshamayachna sweekaar karne se manaa kar detii he or use bataati he ki agar vah sachmuch usase kshamaa chahta he, to use kadi mehnat se ise hasil karnaa hoga
 To do this, she gives him a personal assistant's job
 jaise hi raaj kaam karnaa shuru karata he, shreya usase kadi mehnat karwaati he - use har tarah ke kaam saunpti he, safaai se lekar partiyon main seva, shopping bag thaamne tak
 vah use har sambhav avasar par apamaanit karne kii koshish karti he
 But Raj remains firm on his resolve and continues to serve without any complaints
 ant main vah haar jaati he or use bataati he ki register ke karyaalay ke baahar akele baithe hue usne kitni pidaa mahasoos kii thi
 She refuses to accept his apology and tells Raj to give up this hope and return home
 lekin jab vah sidney kii apni udaan ke liye intazaar kar rahaa hota he, to shreya hawaii adde par pahunchati he or usase milti he tathaa bataati he ki usne mahasoos kiya he ki uski kunthaon kii jad raaj ke khilaaf uske man main dabi nafrat he
 She thanks him and tells him that she is forgiving him
 raaj romanchit ho jaataa he or australia laut aata he
 On his return, Raj finds several letters from Gayatri
 jab vah dur tha, gayatri ne uske prastaav par dubaara vichaar kiya tha or use thukaraane ke liye raaj ke prati khed vyakt kiya tha
 The film ends with Raj finding her and reuniting with her
