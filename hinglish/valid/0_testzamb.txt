 In probability theory and statistics, the square root of the variance of a statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is called the standard deviation
 maanak vichlan, vyapak rup se prayog hone vaala ek maapdand he prakirnan kii maap karata he ki aankade kitne 'faile hue' hai
 Standard deviation is more convenient in algebra terms, although in practice it is less robust than expected deviation or mean absolute deviation
 isse pataa chalata he ki yahaan "ausat" se kitni bhinnata he
 This can be considered as the average difference of the digits from the mean of the distribution to how far they are from the mean
 ek nimna maanak vichlan ingit karata he ki data ke ank madhyamaan ke bahut sameep hote hai jabaki ucch maanak vichlan ingit karata he ki data, maanon kii ek bahut badi shrenee par failaa hua he
 For example, the average height of adult males in the United States is 70 inches and at the same time their standard deviation is about 3 inches
 iskaa matlab he ki adhikansh purushon kii oonchai madhyamaan ) ke 3 inch ke bheetar – ek maanak vichlan he jabaki lagbhag sabhi purushon kii oonchai madhyamaan ) ke 6 inch ke bheetar – 2 maanak vichlan he
 If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would have been exactly 70 inches high
 If the standard deviation had been 20 inches, there would have been a much greater difference in men's heights, especially around 50 to 90 inches
 Statements of 99% of the population sample were studied by assuming the distribution to be normal under three standard deviations
 jansankhya kii parivartaneeyata ko vyakt karne ke alaava, maanak vichlan ko aam taur par sankhyikeey nishkarsh ke vishwaas ko maapne ke liye prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 For example, if the same election has been held multiple times, the error range of the polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation of the result

 In science, researchers usually report the standard deviation of experimental data, and the only effect that is well beyond the range of standard deviations is considered statistically significant — excluding normal random error or measurement variance from causal variance
 Are being given
 maanak vichlan, vitt main bhi mahatvapurn he, jahaan kisi nivesh ke pratifal dar kaa maanak vichlan, nivesh kii asthirataa kaa ek maap he
 The standard deviation noun was first used in the writings of Carl Pearson in 1894, and then in his lectures
 ise ek hi vichaar ko vyakt karne vaale aarambhik vaikalpik naamon ke badale prayog kiya gaya: udhaaharan ke taur par gaus ne "madhyamaan truti" kaa prayog kiya
 a useful feature of standard deviation is that unlike variance, it is expressed in the same units as data
 dhyaan den, tathaapi, ki ikai ke rup main pratishat yukt maapan ke liye, maanak vichlan main ikai ke rup main pratishat ank hoga
 When only one sample of data is available from a population, the standard deviation of the population can be estimated by a modified quantity called the sample standard deviation, which is explained below
 maan len ki jansankhya main nimnlikhit maan hai: It has a total of eight data digits with a mean value of 5: jansankhya ke maanak vichlan kii gananaa karne ke liye, sabase pehle madhyamaan se prayek data ank ke antar kaa pariklan karen or pratifal kaa varg nikaalen: Then divide the sum of these values by the number of figures and find the square root of them to find the standard deviation: is prakaar, uparokt udhaaharan se pataa chalata he ki jansankhya kaa maanak vichlan 2 he
 The above example is the idea of a whole population
 yadi kuch mul jansankhya se yadrichhik namoona dwaara 8 maanon ko praapt kiya jaataa he, to namoona maanak vichlan ke pariklan main 8 ke bajaay 7 se bhaag diya jaayegaa
 See the section Estimating the standard deviation of the population for interpretation
 maan len, x ek yadrichhik parivartaneey he jiskaa madhyamaan maan μ he: Here, operator e represents the average or expected value of X
 to, x kii maanak vichlan maatra he That is, the standard deviation σ is the square root of the average value of 2
 is maamle main jahaan X, ek parimit data set x 1 , x 2 , 


, x n { \ displaystyle x_{1},x_{2}, \ ldots ,x_{n}} se yadrichhik maan praapt karata he jiske prayek maan main ek hi prayikta he, to maanak vichlan he Or, using summation notation, prayikta vitaran kaa maanak vichlan, usee prakaar ke vitaran vaale yadrichhik parivartaneey ke maanak vichlan ke samaan hi hota he
 Since these expected values do not have to occur, not all random variables have a standard deviation
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek yadrichhik parivartaneey kaa maanak vichlan, jo ek cochi vitaran kaa anusaran karata he, paribhaashit rahata he kyonki iskaa pratyaashit maan, aparibhaashit hota he
 The continuous distribution typically provides a formula for calculating the standard deviation as a function of the parameters of the distribution
 saadharantah, prayikta ghanatv falan p yukt ek satat vaastavik mulya vaale yadrichhik parivartaneey x kaa maanak vichlan Is where or jahaan abhinn, nishchit abhinn he jo x kii shrenee par x shrenee kaa kalpit maan he
 The standard deviation of a discrete random variable is the root-mean-square deviation of its values from the mean
 yadi yadrichhik parivartaneey X, samaan prayikta vaale n maanon x 1 , 


, x n { \ displaystyle \ textstyle x_{1}, \ dots ,x_{n}} ko grahan karata he, to iske maanak vichlan σ kii gananaa nimna prakaar se kii ja sakati he: This calculation is described by the following formula: jahaan x ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ overline {x}}}, maan xi kaa ankaganitiya madhyamaan he, jo nimna rup main paribhaashit he: If the probability of all values is not the same, but the probability of the value xi is the same as pi, then the standard deviation can be calculated as follows: jahaan And n 'is the number of non-zero load elements
 ek data set kaa maanak vichlan, asatat yadrichhik parivartaneey ke maanak vichlan ke samaan hi hota he jo data set se vidhipurvak maanon kii kalpana kar saktaa he jahaan prayek maan kaa bindu aadhiky, data set main isaki bahulata ke samaanupatik hota he
 Suppose we wanted to find the standard deviation of a data set consisting of 3, 7, 7 and 19 values
 charan 1: 3, 7, 7 or 19 kaa ankaganitiya madhyamaan gyaat karen, Step 2: Find the deviation of each number from the mean, charan 3: prayek vichlan kaa varg nikaalen, jo bade vichalnon ko parivardhit karti hai or rinatmak maanon ko dhanatmak main badal detii he, Step 4: Find the mean of those quadratic deviations charan 5: bhagfal ke gaiyr-rinatmak vargamul len, So, the standard deviation of the set is 6
 is udhaaharan se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki, saamaanya rup se, maanak vichlan madhyamaan nirpeksh vichlan se bhinn hota he
 Note that if the above data set represents only a sample of the larger population, then estimating the standard deviation of the population would require calculating a modified standard deviation that would provide 6
93 for this example
 vargit vichalnon ke yogafal kii gananaa kaa sarleekaran nimna prakaar se kiya ja saktaa he
 Applying it to the original formula of standard deviation is obtained: kaa vargamul nikaalkar ise smriti main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In some circumstances the standard deviation of the entire population expressed can be found where a sample of each member of the population is available
 In cases where this cannot be done, the standard deviation σ is estimated by testing a random sample taken from the population
 kuch akalankarta neeche die gaye hai: An estimator of σ, sometimes used, is the standard deviation of a sample marked by sn and defined as: is akalankarta main "namoona maanak vichlan" kii apeksha ek-samaan chota madhyamaan vargit truti hoti he or jab jansankhya ko aam taur par vitarit kiya jaataa he tab yah adhiktam sambhavit akalan hota he
 But this estimator, when implemented in a small or moderately sized sample, falls far short: it is a biased estimator
 σ prayog kaa sarvaadhik saamaanya akalankarta ek samyojit sanskaran, namoona maanak vichlan he jise "s" dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he or nimna rup main paribhaashit he: Where {x 1, x 2,


, x N} { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ {x_ {1}, \ , x_ {2}, \ , \ ldots, \ , x_ {N} \ }}, is the sample and x ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ overline {x}}}, is the mean of the sample
 is sanshuddhi ko besel kii sanshuddhi ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The reason for this correction is that s 2 is an unbiased estimator of the variance of the underlying population, σ2, if that variance exists and the value of the sample is independently generated with replacement
 However, s is not an unbiased estimator of standard deviation σ, rather it is helpful in under-estimating the standard deviation of a population
 dhyaan den ki shabd "namoonay kaa maanak vichlan" asanshuddh akalankarta ke liye prayog main laayaa jaataa he jabaki shabd "namoona maanak vichlan" sanshuddh akalankarta ke liye prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Every n - 1 is the number of degrees of freedom in the scalar scalar, { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle}
 sankhyikee Where IQR is the interquartile range of the sample, σ is the corresponding estimate if the population is normally distributed
 The interquartile range IQR is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile of the data
 namoona maanak vichlan se ek ke sambandh main is akalankarta kii anantsparshi saapeksh dakshata, 0
37 he
 Therefore it is better to use one than the sample standard deviation for normal data; This estimator can be more efficient when there is more information in the data
 haalanki σ ke liye ek nishpaksh akalankarta ko gyaat kiya jaataa he jab yadrichhik parivartaneey ko saamaanya rup se vitarit kiya jaataa he, sutara jatil hota he or ek maamuli sanshuddhi kii phalganana karata he: adhik jaankaree ke liye maanak vichlan kaa nishpaksh akalan dekhen
 iske alaava, nishpakshta hameshaa vaanchhneeya nahin hota he: ek akalankarta kaa pakshpaat dekhen
 For constants c and random variables x and Y: jahaan var { \ displaystyle \ operatorname {var} } or cov { \ displaystyle \ operatorname {cov} } kramshah prasaran or sahprasran ke pratik hai
 a large standard deviation indicates that the data points are far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are grouped very closely around the mean
 udhaaharan ke liye, teen jansankhya {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} main se prayek kaa madhyamaan 7 he
 Their standard deviations are 7, 5 and 1 respectively
 teesri jansankhya kaa maanak vichlan anya do vichalnon kii apeksha kam hota he kyonki inke sabhi maan 7 ke kareeb hai
 In an ambiguous sense, the standard deviation tells us how far the data points must pass through the medium
 It will have the same number of units as the data itself
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi data set {0, 6, 8, 14} chaar bhai-bahanon kii kii ek sankhya kii aayu ko varsh main pradarshit karata he to maanak vichlan 5 varsh hota he
 As a second example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} expresses the distances traveled by four athletes in meters
 iskaa madhyamaan 1007 meter he or maanak vichlan 5 meter he
 The standard deviation can serve as a measure of uncertainty
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhautik vigyaan main dohraye gaye maapan ke ek samooh ke prativedit maanak vichlan ko un maapnon kii suspashtataa pradaan kerani chahie
 jab yah nishchay kiya jaataa he ki kya maapan, saidhantik bhavishyavaanee se sahamat he tab un maapnon kaa maanak vichlan mahatva nirnaayak hota he: yadi maapan kaa madhyamaan bhavishyavaanee se bahut dur ho, to pareekshanmulak siddhant ko sambhawatah parishodhit karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 This implies that they fall out of the range of values that would be reasonably expected to occur if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation only was properly determined
 See prediction interval
 maanon ke ek samooh ke maanak vichlan ko samajhane kaa vyavhaarik maan nirdhaaran ke adheen he ki "ausat" se kitni bhinnata he
 As a simple example, consider the average temperature of cities
 While the average temperature of the two cities can be 15 ° C, it is helpful to understand that the city limits near the coast are smaller than the inland cities, which makes it clear that while the average is similar but closer to the beach Inland variation is more likely than not
 to, ek shahar kaa ausat taapmaana 15 hota he jiskaa adhiktam taapmaana 25 °C or nimna taapmaana 5 °C ho or aisa duusare shahar ke saath bhi hota he jiskaa adhiktam taapmaana 18 or nimna taapmaana 12 ho
 maanak vichlan hamen pahchaanane kii anumati pradaan karata he ki vyapak bhinnata vaale shahar kaa ausat or is prakaar ek ucch maanak vichlan taapmaana kaa utana vishwasaneey bhavishyavaanee pradaan nahin karegaa jitna kam bhinnata vaala or nimna maanak vichlan vaala shahar kaa ausat pradaan karegaa
 Another way to understand this is to consider the sports teams
 In any category group, there will be teams that will get higher rates and sometimes worse
 It is likely that the teams that lead in the standings will not exhibit such contrast but they will do well in most categories
 The lower the standard deviation of their rating in each category, the more balanced and consistent they will be
 Whereas teams with higher standard deviations will be more incommensurable
 For example, a team that is consistently poor in most categories will have a lower standard deviation
 a team that is consistently good in most categories will also have a lower standard deviation
 However, a team with a high standard deviation may be the type of team that scores a lot but also allows a lot of leeway, or vice versa, yah bhavishyavaanee karne kii koshish karnaa ki kisi bhi nirdhaarit din ko koun si team jeetegi, iske liye team ke vibhinn "aankadon" kii reating ke maanak vichlan par dhyaan dena hoga jiske antargat asangati yah samajhane kii koshish main shakti banaam kamajori kaa milan kar saktaa he ki koun se kaarak antim scoring parinaam ke shashakt sanketakon ke rup main abhibhavi ho sakate hai

 vitt main, maanak vichlan kisi pradutt pratibhuti se jude jokhim yaa pratibhutiyon ke ek portpholio ke jokhim kaa ek pradarshan he
 Risk is an important factor in determining how an investment portfolio should be managed efficiently as it determines the variance of assets and / or portfolio returns and provides investors with a mathematical basis for investment decisions
 The overall concept of risk is that when it increases, the expected risk premium of the asset will increase as the expected return of the asset increases - in other words, investors should expect a higher return on investment when the perceived investment has a higher level of risk or that There should be uncertainty of consideration
 At the time of valuation of investments, investors should assess both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns
 The standard deviation provides a skewed estimate of the uncertainty of future returns
 udhaaharan ke liye, maan len ki kisi niveshak ko donon stock main se kisi ek kaa chayan karnaa tha
 Stock a had an average return of 10% for the past 20 years with a standard deviation of 20 percentage points and Stock b had a 12% average return over the same time period but had a higher standard deviation of 30 pp
 jokhim or pratifal ke aadhaar par, ek niveshak nirnay kar saktaa he ki stock a adhik surakshit vikalp he kyonki stock b ke pratifal ke atirikt 2% ank kaa atirikt 10 pp maanak vichlan ke saamne koi mulya nahin he
 Under the same circumstances, the initial investment of stock b is likely to decrease several times over that of stock a and on average only 2% higher returns are estimated
 is udhaaharan main, stock a main lagbhag 10%, 20 pp adhik yaa kam, bhavishyat varsh ke pratifal kaa lagbhag do-tihaai kamaane kii ummid he
 At the time of considering the maximum possible return or outcome in the future, an investor should expect results up to 10% more or less 60 pp, or a range from 70% to 50% with three standard deviations of the average return
 The result is included
 ek pradutt samyavadhi ke dauraan ek pratibhuti ke ausat pratifal kii gananaa karne par aasti kaa ek pratyaashit pratifal utpann hoga
 prayek avadhi ke liye, vaastavik pratifal se pratyaashit pratifal ko ghataane ke falswaroop prasaran kii prapti hoti he
 To find the effect of the result of the overall risk of the asset, find the square of variance of each period
 The longer the variance of the duration, the more risk the security carries
 vargit prasaranon kaa ausat nikaalane ke parinamswaroop aasti se jude samgr ikaayiyon kaa maap praapt hota he
 Finding the square root of this variance will result in the standard deviation of the investment instrument in question
 jansankhya maanak vichlan ko bowlinger pattiyon, vyapak taur par apanaae gaye ek takneekee vishleshan upkaran kii chaudaai ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the upper Bollinger bar is given as follows: kuch jyamitiya antardrushti praapt karne ke liye, humlog teen maanon, x 1, x 2, x 3 kii ek jansankhya ke saath shuru karenge
 yah ek ank p = r 3 main ko paribhaashit karata he
 Let the line l = {: r in R}
 This is the "main diagonal" that passes through the site of origin
 yadi hamaare sabhi teenon pradutt maan baraabar the, to maanak vichlan shunya hoga or P, l par avasthit hoga
 yah maananaa anuchit nahin he ki maanak vichlan, p se l kii duuri se sambandhit he
 And that's really the subject

 a corresponding formula is also valid for a population of n values; After that we have to work in RN
 maanak vichlan An observation is rarely more than a few standard deviations away from the mean

 For different values of Z, the percentages of values that are expected to be in and out of symmetric intervals are as follows: seemaa ke bheetar ke pratishat ko sutara dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he:%perc = erf × 50% + 50% The mean and standard deviation of a set of data are usually reported simultaneously
 ek khaas myne main, yadi data ke centre ko madhyamaan ke sandarbh main mapa jaataa he to maanak vichlan, sankhyikeey prakirnan kaa ek "swaabhaavik" maap hota he
 This is because the standard deviation of the mean is less than any other point
 sateek vivaran nimnlikhit he: maan len x 1,

 It is a dimensionless number that can be used to compare the amount of variance between populations with populations close to each other
 kaaran yah he ki yadi aap ek hi maanak vichlan vaale lekin alag-alag madhyamaan vaale jansankhyaon kii tulana karte hai to bhinnata kaa gunank, kam madhyamaan vaale jansankhya ke liye adhik hoga

 If we want to find the mean by the sample of the distribution, then the standard deviation of the mean is related to the standard deviation of the distribution by jahaan N, madhyamaan kaa akalan karne ke liye prayukt namoonay ke avlokan kii sankhya he
 The following two formulas can represent an ongoing standard deviation

 It is the name of every activity of the government, which involves public welfare or national development
 atah yah na keval saamaanya / niamkeey prashasan se judaa he apitu maanviya jivan ke sabhi pahalu- saamaajik, saanskrithik, aarthik ityadi bhi isse jude hai
 The concept of development administration is a by-product of comparative studies of public administration in developing countries
 is shabd kaa sarvapratham prayog 1955 main you0 el0 goswami ne kiya tha parantu ise aupchaarik manyata us samay praapt hui jab american lok prashasan samiti ke tulanaatmak prashasan samooh evam saamaajik vigyaan shodh parishad kii tulanaatmak raajnneeti samiti ne isko bauddhik aadhaar pradaan kiya
 Names of Fred W
 Riggs, Edward W
 Weidner, Joseph Law Polombar, Albert Waterson, etc
 are prominent in popularizing this concept
 vikaas prashasan kii avdhaaran asia, africa, evam latin america ke duusare vishwayuddh ke pashchaat hue swatantra deshon ke liye arthpurna he
 After gaining independence from their colonial rulers, efforts were made to move from underdeveloped economy to developed economy in these countries
 vikaas ke kram se guzarate hue in deshon ko vikasshil desh kaha gaya jinke sammukh vikaas sambandhi anek samasyaayen thi
 Their major task was to bring socio-economic change through planned change
 paramparaagat lok prashasan, prashasan pranali ke sudhaar se sambandhit tha atev lok prashasan ke ek naye swaroop ko viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa anubhav kii gai jo vikasshil deshon kii saamaajik-aarthik evam prashasaneey samasyaon ke adhyayan par dhyaan kendrit karegaa
 Thus, the idea of development administration was conceptualized
 san 1950 or 1960 ke dashakon ke dauraan lok prashasan ke vidwaanon ne lok prashasan ke paaramparik drushtikonon jinamein paashchaatya mulya unmukh tha, prakruti ke prati kaaphi ansatosh vyakt kiya
 Scholars were also dissatisfied with the excessive reliance of public administration studies on the American experience as a quantum base of information
 atah mil-julkar iskaa yah arth tha ki sari baat ko amareeki mulya tantra se aankaa jaataa he jis tantra main tisare vishwa or samyavaadee deshon ke bare main moolyabhaarit vichaar rahata he
 After the Second World War many African and Asian countries became independent and were in various stages of socio-economic, political and administrative development
 chunki in deshon kaa prashasan anivarytah vikaas unmukh tha
 Hence, the eagerness to study the administration of these countries developed among the scholars
 unka adhyayan vastutah vikaas prashasan kaa adhyayan ban gaya
 In the post World War II era, several agencies of the United Nations and the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union began to provide full technical assistance to these newly emerging nation states
 america or soviet sangh dwaara in deshon ko aisi sahaayta dene kaa prayojan sanyukt raashtra sangh main apni-apni ore unka samarthan praapt karnaa tha
 Experts engaged in these technological programs soon realized that the administrative structures and principles of Western countries should be suitable for these countries also, there is no need
 in deshon ko di janevaali sahaayta kaa uchit upyog karne main unhen samarth banane kii vidhiyon kii khoj karne ke uddeshy se unke prashasan tantron kaa adhyayan karne kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Development administration has its origins in American behavioral sciences
 raajnneeti shaastra main vyavahaarparak kranti se protsaahit hokar lok prashasan ne bhi tulanaatmak lok prashasan ke kshetra main vyavahaarparak adhyayanon par bal diya jiskaa arth vikaas prashasan main prashasan kii bhoomika kaa adhyayan bhi tha
 Although their aim was to study only public administration with emphasis on the situation, but due to this naturally development administration was also studied
 tisare vishwa ke deshon me samay or prakritik sansadhano kii kaaphi kami thi jabaki unki aavashyaktaa turant or teevr saamaajik aarthik vikaas kii thi
 These goals could not be achieved with the help of a passive administration which was closed and status quoist
 atah ek aise prashasan tantra kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai jo viksit deshon ke prashasnic dhaanche se bhinn ho or is prakaar vikaas prashasan kii sankalpana kaa aavirbhaav hua
 Following are some definitions given by scholars of development administration - pro vedenar ke anusaar, “vikaas prashasan raajnneetik, aarthik or saamaajik pragati ke liye sanghathan kaa maargdarshan karata he
 It mainly emphasizes on a work oriented and target oriented administrative system
 pro rigs ne iske sambandh main kaha he ki “vikaas prashasan kaa sambandh kaaryakramon ke prashasan, bade sanghathanon visheshkar sarkaar kii pranaaliyon, vikaas lakshyon kii uplabdhi ke liye nitiyon ore yojanaon ko kriyanvit karne se hai
 Donald C
 Stone states that "development administration is a combination of all elements and means as a joint effort to achieve the set goals
" iskaa lakshya nirdhaarit samaykram ke antargat vikaas ke purv-nirdhaarit uddeshyon kii prapti he
 Despite the differences in the above definitions, it is seen that development administration is goal-oriented and action-oriented
 paribhaashaon ke vishleshan ke baad vikaas prashasan ke sambandh main nimnlikhit tatva saamne aate hai- However, the main differentiators between traditional administration and development administration are: donon avadharanaai ek-duusare se puri tarah sambandhit kintu bhinn hai
 Development administration means development programs, while administrative development means making the administrative system efficient, efficient and effective
 samaaj kalyaan yaa sakshartaa ke liye jo tantra kaary kar rahaa he vah vikaas prashasan he or samaaj kalyaan prashasan ko sugathit karnaa va uddeshy ke anukool bananaa prashasnic vikaas he
 Administrative development is not limited to development administration alone
 saamaanya prashasan ke vikaas ko bhi prashaskeey vikaas kahenge
 For example, the functioning of police under British rule was not compatible with democracy
 use anukool bananaa prashaskeey vikaas hoga
 According to Prof
 Riggs, development of development administration is very important because without it the goal of development cannot be achieved
 kshamtahin prashasan vikaas kaary nahin kar saktaa
 Also, it is necessary for administrative development that the environment should also be developed because the environment affects administrative development the most
 vikaas prashasan tathaa prashasnic vikaas ke bich paraspar nirbharta kaa sambandh he
 Development administration has many beneficial properties compared to traditional approaches of administration such as- vikaas prashasan vikaas kii samasyaon evam inke nidaan ke aavashyak upayon kaa vyapak vishleshan karne ke ek saadhan kii tarah kaary karata he
 Earlier, development and welfare did not come in the government domain
 vikaas prashasan lok prashasan ke vikaas main ek bahut mahatvapurn tathy he
 It has broadened the boundaries of public administration by bringing public policy, its implementation and value oriented in the field of public administration
 karyrat prashaskon or shikshavidon ke liye iskaa pratyaksh mahatva he
 Because they are directly involved in the problems of public development and the problems created by the development process
 vikaas prashasan ne pashchimi model kii aparyaapttaon kii ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan safaltaapurvak aakrisht kiya he or vikaas kaaryon ke sandarbh main unki aparyaaptta sabit kii he
 Therefore, it has fragmented the comparative studies of comparative public administration as well as consideration of the universality of theory and practice of public administration
 vikaas prashasan prashasnic tantra par samskruti ke prabhaav ko bhi maanata hai or isliye vikaas ke raajnneetik, aarthik evam saamaajik-saanskrithik pakshon ke tulykaalan evam sankraman par bal detaa he
 Highlighting the inadequacies of Western models, Practices Administration also highlights the inadequacies of their administrative methods and practices
 chunki pashchimi model purab main prayojya nahin rahe, atah vikaas prashasan deshaj prashasnic vidhiyon ke vikaas kaa samarthan karata hai
 For example, India has adopted the Panchayati Raj model of development, it has its own method
 vikaas prashasan, prashasan ke maanav karkon par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 Those who were being ignored earlier
 yah is arth me adhik loktantric he ki yah nichle str se vichaaron kaa pravaah env vikaas prakriya main logon kii bhagidaari bhi protsaahit karata he jo ki vikaas prashasan kii safalataa ke liye anivaary he
 Development administration is the functional aspect of government which is goal oriented development development administration is not only administration for the public but it is administration working with the people
 sankshep, me vikaas prashasan kii nimnlikhit visheshtaayen hai- Variable: The focus of development administration is variability
 yah parivartan saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik he
 Administration in developing countries has to go through a period of constant changes
 is prakaar parivartanshiltaa vikaas prashasan kii bahumoolya poonji he jiske sahare vah sakriy bana rahata he
 Developmental nature: Fensode has rightly said that development administration depends on new reforms and innovations
 isaki prakruti vikasaatmak kaaryakramon ko lekar chalane kii hoti hai
 Its main objective is to develop a backward society from a social, economic and political point of view
 prajatantrik mulyon se sambandhit vikaas prashasan jan-aakankshaon kii purti ke prati prayantshil rahata he
 At the same time, development administration is associated with democratic values, because it contains respect for human rights and values, purpose of public interest and sense of responsibility
 chunki vikaas prashasan kaa sambandh sarkari prashasan dwaara kiye jane vaale prayaason se he or sarkari prayaas janakalyaan or prajatantrik mulyon se jude rahete hai, atah vikaas prashasan dwaara kiye jane vaale prayaason se he or sarkari prayaas janakalyaan or prajatantrik mulyon se jude rahete hai, atah vikaas prashasan ko prajatantrik mulyon se pruthak nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Modernization: It has become necessary to adopt a modern approach to the development of developing countries
 saath hi aaj ke aadhunik uddeshyon ko praapt karne hetu vikaas prashasan ko apane aapako yogya bananaa padataa he
 For this administrative modernization has to be promoted
 prashasnic aadhunikeekaran ke liye vikaas prashasan viksit deshon se maapdand or takanic praapt karata hai
 Administrative efficiency: Efficiency is the key to the success of administration
 vikaas prashasan main prashasnic kushalta ko isliye mahatva diya jaataa he ki iske abhaav main vikaas ke uddeshyon ko safaltaapurvak praapt karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Development administration is constantly trying to increase the efficiency of administration through administrative development
 aarthik vikaas : aarthik vikaas or vikaas prashasan kaa paraspar mahatvapurn sambandh he
 Economic development is also necessary for administrative development
 vikasshil deshon kii vibhinn aarthik yojanaayen evam vikaas sambandhi kaarykram vikaas prashasan ke sahyog se hi lagu kiye jate hai
 Development Administration creates an administrative organization that makes the country's economic progress possible and paves the way for economic development
 raashtra ke vikaas ke liye aarthik yojanaayen atyant mahatvapurn hoti hai or unhen lagu karne me vikaas prashasan mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa hai Result-oriented: Another important feature of development administration is its result-oriented
 vikaas prashasan se yah apeksha kii jaati he ki vah nirdhaarit seemaa ke antargat kaaryon ko sampann karen or parinaam achche hon
 Results are given more importance in this vikaas prashasan lok prashasan kii ek naveen vistrut shakha hai
 It has been born in the context of implementing new administrative plans and programs of developing countries, in its field all the functions of public administration which are related to the formulation of policies, plans, programs
 sankshep main, iske kshetra main ve samast, gatividhiyaan aati hai jo saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik, odyogic tathaa prashasnic vikaas se sambandhit hon or jo sarkaar dwaara sanchalit kii jaati hon
 Just as it is not possible to determine the area of development, similarly it is not possible to determine the area of development administration
 iske kshetra kaa adhyayan nimnlikhit sheershakon ke antargat kiya ja saktaa he- posedcorb Theory: Since development administration is only a part of public administration, the posedcorb theory propounded by Luther Gulick is relevant to the field of development administration
 yah shabd nimnlikhit shabdon se bana haih All these principles are required in development administration
 prashasnic sudhaar evam prabandhkeey vikaas : in donon kaa vikaas prashasan main atyant mahatva hota he isliye prashasnic sudhaar evam prabandhkeey vikaas par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 There is always a need for improvement in organizations of administration
 prashaskeey sudhaar kaa mukhya uddeshy he jatil kaaryo or prakriyaaon ko saral bananaa tathaa un niyamon kaa nirmaan karnaa jinase nunatam shram env vyay karke adhiktam utpaadak parinaam praapt kiye ja saken
 For this, various commissions and committees are constituted from time to time and their reports are sought regarding administrative reforms
 lok sevakon ke liye prashikshan : vikaas prashasan ko naveen yojanaon, vishesheekaran tathaa jatil prashasnic kaaryakramon ko lagu karnaa padataa he
 The development administration needs favorable public servants to carry out such tasks
 iske liye lok sevakon ko prashikshan hetu vibhinn prakaar ke visheshikrut prashikshan sansthaanon main bheja jaataa he, jahaan unhen prashaskeey samasyaon or sanghathanaatmak prabandh aadi ke vishay main bataaya jaataa hai is prakaar samay ke saath badali hui aadhunik paristhitiyon ke anukool apane lok sevakon ko prashikshit karnaa vikaas prashasan kar mahatvapurn kaary he
 Use of modern managerial technology: An important task of development administration is to discover new management techniques that can increase efficiency in development programs
 is sambandh main viksit deshon main apanaaye jane vaale naveen prabandhkeey tareekon ko lagu karnaa chahie
 Programs of Development: As it is known, an important task of development administration is to implement the programs of rural and urban development
 bharat jaise vikasshil deshon ke liye anek yojanaayen evam kaarykram lagu kiye jate he
 It is an important task of development administration to make them accessible to the people through modern technology
 jan sampark kaa sahyog : prashasan kaa uddeshy janhit hota he atah vikaas sambandhi kaaryakramon ko lagu karne ke liye jan sahyog evam jan sampark atyant aavashyak he
 It is clear from this that public relations and public cooperation have special importance in development administration
 vastav main jan sampark ke dwaara yah janaa ja saktaa he ki jo janakalyaan sambandhi kaarykram chalaaye ja rahe hai unka laabh aam janata tak pahunchataa he yaa nahin tathaa janata kii unke prati kya pratikriya hoti he
 Public cooperation is not only necessary for development administration, but success is not possible in the absence of it
 aarthik, saamaajik va raajnneetik dhaanche kaa vikaas : vastutah aarthik, saamaajik va raajnneetik vikaas sambandhi kaary vikaas prashasan kii ridh hote hai
 Working in this direction is challenging
 paramparaagat sanrachanaon kii kamiyon or prakriyaaon ko sudhaar kar unki jagah naveen prakaar ke aarthik va saamaajik dhaanche kaa nirmaan karnaa vikaas prashasan ke saamne ek bahut jatil kaary ban gaya he
 It becomes necessary to develop and improve these structures
 is prakaar vikaas prashasan ke kshetra main aarthik, saamaajik tathaa raajnneetik dhaanche kaa vikaas karnaa ek mahatvapurn kaary he

 It was at this stage that a book called Russo's Social Contract, which gave birth to a new concept about the state

 This idea gave the courtiers the dream that a child born in their home could be a king

 In such a situation, who is the government to make four lakh cars of five lakh by imposing import and export tax? When the domestic consumers and foreign businessmen agreed like mian-bibi, the government lurked like Kazi

 Do not break boundaries and form a global party

 It is clear from the analysis of these conditions that human society has entered an era where 80 percent of GDP is being produced by the toil of the machine and the human share is not even 20 percent

 Due to the connection of most of the GDP with the machine, the richness of the country is increasing and poverty is increasing in most of the families of the country
 ek taraf utpaadan se godaam bhare pade hai, duusari taraf bhukh or aarthik tangi se log aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 In such a difficult situation, a proposal in the name of votership has been introduced in the Lok Sabha by some sensitive mps
 is prastaav ke madhyam se yah kaha ja rahaa he ki ab sabhi nagarikon ko parmparik arthon main kaam dene kaa intjaar karne ke bajaay sabko sidhaa paisa diya janaa chahie or badalte yug main kaam kii paribhaasha bhi badalani chahie
 It has been clarified in this proposal that the work is being done mostly by machines, so there has been a cut-throat competition among the laborers
 majdoor kisi bhi dar par kaam karne ko taiyaar ho gaye hai or bhukh ke kaaran blakemel ho rahe hai
 Circumstances have become such that the labor itself is violating labor laws
 praan raksha kii aapadaa main insaan ko dur kaa laabh dikhnaa band ho jaataa he
 In the present era of world economy, the wages of laborers at the rate of market is similar to the straw of bulls, the hard work of machines is producing the wheat like note, now rules should be made to distribute this wheat among laborers
 
 is yachika main anek ayaamon se paristhitiyon kaa vishleshan karte hue yah prastaav rakhaa gaya he ki mashin kii mehnat se jo note chap rahi he, matadaataaon ke bich uskaa samyavaadee vitaran hona chahie or insaanon kii mehnat se chhapi noton kaa vitaran poonjivadi mulyon ke anusaar kiya janaa chahie
 By equitably distributing the notes printed with the hard work of the machine, people will get a share in the shared wealth and their status will be that of a member of the family instead of the bull working in the field
 yah ek aisi sthiti hogi jisamen bail ko bhunsa bhale hi na mil sakaa ho, lekin use gehun main hissedari mil jaaegi
 The amount of Gross Domestic Machine Product, Gross Domestic Interest, Gross Domestic Rent, Gross Domestic Succession have been recognized as shared funds in this petition
 yah bhi bhavishyavaanee kii gai he ki desh kii sarkaar kaa vash vishwa str par nahin chalata, isliye parmparik arthon main sabhi logon ko kaam dena ab bhavishya main kabhi bhi na puraa hone vaala sapana he
 The biggest feature of this petition is that it makes it possible for everyone to get money and it is impossible for everyone to get work
 yachika main yah prastaav nahin he ki mashin va viraasat kii rakam main apana hissaa logon ko mili, iske liye netaaon va adhikariyon ko adhikrut kiya jaae
 The proposal is that the Reserve Bank should open the account of all voters and send half the amount of average production per person per month to its account every month
 yah rakam bhrashtachar kii shikaar na ho iske liye sabhi matadaataaon ko pahchaan patr ke bajaay e0tii0em0 cash card jari karne kaa prastaav he
 The petition has demanded the installation of ATM machines in all post offices
 jahaan jaakar sthaneey matadaata apane hisse kii rakam har maheene nikaal saken
 a transnational organization, a transnational-shared government, a joint parliament and a common court will be needed to manage the economy of the votership
 inkaa kharch nikaalane ke liye bhi is yachika main ji0 di0 pi0 kii nakad rakam kaa ek hissaa alag karne kaa prastaav he
 In this way, a part of the average production per capita will go to the voters, another will go to the transnational common organization and the common government, and the third part is proposed to be remitted to the public account in the form of donations for the people's representatives
 is prastaav ke lagu hone par janpratinidhi ko matadaataaon kii ore se keval vot hi nahin milenge, apitu vot ke anupaat main chande ke rup main note bhi praapt honge
 With this scientific system of political finance, the people's representatives and the candidates contesting elections will become accountable to the people
 yah javabdehi ve jitani badhaate jaaenge, unka chanda va unki sampannataa usee anupaat main badhati jaaegi
 If a provision is made to give 1750 rupees to a voter in a month, then through this arrangement of political donations, the candidates who get one thousand votes can get 17
5 lakh rupees as annual donation, one lakh votes get 17
5 crores
 You can get money
 is rakam se janpratinidhi va pratyaasi sau-pachaas logon ko rojgaar de sakate hai, va apana sachivalay bana sakate hai
 With this system of political finance, democracy will be freed from the clutches of those who donate and will join the people honestly

 doosraa yah ki milinium deveopment gol ke naam par viksit deshon ko jo dhan apane kartavya ke taur par aviksit va vikasshil deshon ko dena tha, use dene main ab ve hila hawali nahin kar paaenge
 Now they will not even be able to say that the leaders and bureaucrats of poor countries are corrupt, so their money will not reach the needy people
 chunki ab sabhi matadaataaon kaa bank main khaataa hoga, isliye viksit desh swayan yah aasaani se dekh sakenge ki unke dwaara diya gaya dhan garib nagarikon ke bank khaaton main ja rahaa he, yaa nahi? is vyavastha ke lagu ho jane ke baad aaj jo dhan videshon se karj ke rup main aata he, kal vah tex ke rup main aane lagegaa
 And the Indian government will be free from debt trap
 votership ke khilaaf sabase bada tark yah diya jaataa he ki bina mehnat ke paisa kisi bhi vyakti ko kyon milanaa chahie or agar milegaa to yah paisa use nikamma banayega? is prashn par yachika main do took jabaab dete hue yah kaha gaya he ki chuki uttaradhikaar main, byaaj main va kiraaye main praapt paisa apni mehnat kaa paisa nahin hota phir bhi yah paisa kuch logon ko dilaane ke liye sansad ne kanoon bana rakhe hai
 Therefore, people should get the money of the votership, making such a law will not be a new step
 keval itnaa hoga ki isse bina mehnat ke praapt hone vaale sroton main ek or nayaa strot jud jayega
 The proposed law of the Votership will only increase the number of recipients without hard work
 pehle kam logon ko miltaa tha, ab zyada logon ko milegaa
 The Parliament which has been giving billions and trillions of rupees to the sons of the rich by enacting the law of succession, cannot refuse to give some cash in succession to the children of the Father of the Nation
 jahaan tak prashn is paise ko praapt hone ke baad nikammapan badhane kii he, to is vishay main yachika main spasht nirnay diya gaya he ki yadi berogari or nikammapan donon main se kisi ek ko chunane kaa hi vikalp ho, to nikammapan raashtra ke hit main he
 Because in the state of unemployment both the hands and the brain of the citizens become inactive, while in the state of inefficiency only the hands remain inactive, the brain keeps working
 kuch logon ko yah asambhav kaam isliye lagata he ki sarkaar itnaa paisa laaegi kahaan se? is vishay main spashtikaran dete hue yachika main kaha gaya he ki yadi adhik rakam sarkaar nahin de sakati, to kuch kam rakam dekar sabhi nagarikon kaa khaataa bank main badi aasaani se khol sakati he
 The numbers of these accounts can be taken before developed countries and multinational corporations and they can be pressured to keep their promise
 chunki is tarah kii vishwa raajnneeti kaa saath vishwa janamat kaa bada hissaa degaa, isliye viksit deshon ko apana aarthikr kattavya karne ke sivaa koi maarg nahin bachegaa
 It should also not be understood that when the proposal of the Votership is going to be implemented, then why should there be any effort to implement it? In fact, on the issue of this petition, things like public awareness, seminars, public meetings, picketing, rallies, signature campaigns, polarization of parties and votes in elections



 matadaatavriti yaa votership ke naam se prastut yah pustak vastav main kai darjan samvedansheel saansadon dwaara loksabhaa main prastut yachika kii prati he
 Due to the low number of pro-parliamentarians, perhaps the petition of this life-long petition will not be able to immediately take the shape of the law and if the sensitivity of the present Parliament is very less, then this petition will sit in Parliament and wait for the people's movement

 This tree really helps, becoming your first belief, behind which you have direct experience of the work done
 aap yah baat apane mitron-doston ko bataate hai
 After a few months, you see that a shrine is being built near that tree, it is possible that you will be in the forefront of those who cooperate for it
 is tarah se vyakti kii manyataayen bhi samuhik manyataayen banati hai
 Illustration 2: If you have had a bad experience with a person related to a particular community, then you may misunderstand all the people related to that particular community

 nanda devi rajajat bharat ke uttaranchal rajya main hone vaali ek nanda devi kii ek dharmik yatra he
 It is one of the most famous cultural events in Uttarakhand
 yah lagbhag 12 varshon ke baad yojit hoti he
 The last caste was in 2012
 agali rajajat san 2023 main hogi
 According to folk history, Nanda was the Ishtadevi of the Katyuri dynasty of Kunmao along with the kings of Garhwal
 ishtadevi hone ke kaaran nandadevi ko rajrajeshwari kahkar sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 Nandadevi is seen as the sister of Parvati, but sometimes Nandadevi is considered as Parvati
 nanda ke anek naamon main pramukh hai shiva, sunanda, shubhananda, nandini
 Being worshiped uniformly throughout Uttaranchal, the entire region of Nandadevi has been seen as a source of religious unity
 rupkund ke narkankal, baguvavasa main sthit aathvin sadi kii siddh vinayak bhagwaan ganesh kii kaale pathar kii murti aadi is yatra kii aitihaasikta ko siddh karte hai, saath hi gadhwal ke paramparaagat nanda jagari bhi is yatra kii kahani ko bayaan karte hai
 There are two types of caste associated with Nandadevi
 vaarshik jaat or rajajat
 The annual caste takes place every year in the month of august-september
 jo kurud ke nanda mandir se shuru hokar vedni kund tak jaati he or phir laut aati he, lekin rajajat 12 varsh yaa usase adhik samyantaral main hoti he
 It is believed that this historical journey of the goddess starts from Nautigaon in Chamoli and also from the temple of Kurud, the Dasoli and Badhon bundles leave for Rajajat
 is yatra main lagbhag 250 kilometre kii duuri, nauti se homkund tak paidal kerani padati he
 During this time, dense forests have to cross stony routes, inaccessible peaks and snowy mountains
 alag-alag raaston se ye doliyaan yatra main milti he
 Apart from this, dolis and chhatoli from village to village are also included in this journey
 kumaun se bhi almoda, kataarmal or nainital se doliyaan nandakeshari main aakar rajajat main shaamil hoti he
 The second stop of this journey started from Nauti is eda-badharani
 phir yatra laut kar nauti aati he
 After this, the world-famous Rupkund, shila-samudra, Hoskund, Chananyanghat from Sutkund, Hathkund to Channianghat, Sutol to Nandprayag and then to Nauti come after the journey of the journey is complete
 it happens
 yah duuri kareeb 280 kilometre he
 This Rajjaat also includes Chausingya Khadu which is born in the local area before the time of the Rajajat, in a two-sided bag placed on its back, the devotees keep jewelry, adornments and other light buffets for the goddess, Which, after worshiping in Homkund, departs further towards the Himalayas
 logon kii manyata he ki chousingya khadu aage bikat himalay main jaakar lupt ho jaataa he va nandadevi ke kshetra kailash main pravesh kar jaataa he
 In the year 2000, this dynasty received wide publicity and thousands of people from all over the country and abroad participated in it
 rajajat uttarakhand kii samgr samskruti ko prastut karata he
 For this reason, on January 26, 2005, the tableau of the state of Uttaranchal was released on the Rajajat
 pichley kuch varshon se payrton vibhaag dwaara rupkund mahotv kaa aayojan bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Local people have also constituted Shri Nandadevi Rajajat Samiti for the successful conduction of this journey
 isi samiti ke tattvadhan main nandadevi rajajat kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 According to the tradition, the yatra is announced on the day of Vasant Panchami
 iske pashchaat isaki taiyaariyon kaa silsilaa armbh hota he
 In this, apart from the Nautiyal of Nauti and Kasuwar of Kasuva, along with other related parties like 14 Sayanas of Badhan, 12 Thoki Brahmins of Chandpur and other priests, the District Administration and various departments of the Central and State Government together prepared the outline of the journey
 Determination is made
 { manyataon ke anusaar rajajat tab hoti he, jab devi kaa dosha lagane ke lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 Dhyani worships Bhumiya Devi Ufrai It is called Maudvi
 dhyaniyan yatra nikaalati he, jise dol jaataraa kaha jaataa he
 Kunwar Nauti of Kasun goes to the village and pleads for Rajajat
 kunwar ringaal kii chhatoli or chousingya khadu lekar aate hai
 The birth of Chausinga Khadu is a special thing of Rajajat
 nautial or kunwar log nanda ke uphaar ko chousinga khadu kii peeth par homkund tak le jate hai
 Khadu moves alone from there
 khadu ke janm saath hi vicitra chamatkaarik ghatnaye shuru ho jaati he
 The lion starts coming there from the very day in which it takes birth, and the lion keeps on coming until the owner of the khadu makes it his wish to pay it to the king
 } Jinda feudalism in the name of Rajajat - Jai Singh Rawat - Sumar Nanda Rajajat is going to start from August 29 in the world's most treacherous, complex and extreme religious walking tours led by a four-horned frog
 basant panchami ke avasar par ghoshit kaarykram ke anusaar puure 19 din tak chalane ke baad yah yatra 16 sitambar ko sampann hogi
 Religious traditions have been changing over time in this Himalayan Mahakumbh, but when feudal traditions will change, this question is being left open and teasing democracy workers
 badrinaath ke kapatodghatan kii hi tarah chamoli gadhwal ke kasuva gaanv ke kunwaron or nauti gaanv ke unke raajaguru nautiyaalon ne bhi is basant panchami ko nandadevi rajajat ke kaarykram kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The Thakurs of Kansuva village consider themselves as descendants of the younger brother of Ajaypal, a king of the Panwar dynasty, who ruled Garhwal for centuries, and as a king, he leads this Himalayan religious padyatra and considers it his personal program
 
 tehri rajshahi ke vanshaj bhi basant panchami ke din har saal badrinaath ke kapatodghatan kii tithi tay karte hai
 According to the program announced by the Kuvars and Nautiyals, the yatra will return from Nauti to Chelgi on August 29 and will return on September 16 after 19 stops in the Himalayan region
 is jokhimpurna yatra ke sakshi banane ke liye desh videsh se log pahunchate hai
 Surprisingly, the priests and the rightful worshipers of the temple from which the ancient temple of Nudai Devi is to be run from the ancient temple of Kurud have been thrown aside like a fly of milk
 rajya sarkaar bhi dharmik bhaawanaaon or praan paramparaon ke bajaay saamanti vyavastha ke saath dridhtaa se khadi najar aa rahi he
 Preparations have been started for Uttarakhand government including the organizing committee and other related parties
 iske saath hi is aitihaasik yatra kaa netritv karne chousingya khadu kii talash bhi shuru ho gayi he
 Prior to the yatra, such a bizarre frog has been born anywhere in the villages of Chandpur and Dasoli strips
 vishesh kaarigari se baniin ringaal kii chantoliyon, doliyon or nishaanon ke saath lagbhag 200 sthaneey devi devtaa is mahayatra main shaamil hote hai
 As per the ancient practice, wherever the journey takes place, the people of that village leave their houses open for the travelers and spend the night themselves in goshalas or elsewhere
 samudratal se 13200 foot kii unchai par sthit is yatra ke gantavya homkund ke baad rang birange vastron se lipte is mende ko akele hi kailash kii ore ravaanaa kar diya jaataa he
 During the journey till the sixteenth stop, this Khadu or Mendha remains near the Chantoli made from the ringle of Nanda Devi
 samudratal se 3200 foot se lekar 17500 foot kii oonchai k pahunchane vaali yah 280 kimi lambi padayatra 19 padaavon se guzarati he
 Vana is the last village of the yatra
 pracheen kaal main iske 22 padaav hone ke bhi pramaan hai
 The journey beyond Vana is inaccessible and at the same time restricted and prohibitive
 aayojan samiti ke sachiv or raajaguru ke rup main nautial brahmanon ke pratinidhi ke rup main kaary kar rahe bhuwan nautial tathaa unke pita devraam nautial ke lekhon ke anusaar wan se kuch aage rinakidhar se chamade kii vastuen jaise juute, belt aadi tathaa gaaje-baaje, striyaan-bachche, abhakshya padaarth khaane vaali jatiyaan ityadi rajajat main nishiddh ho jate hai
 Implicit eating castes is not hidden
 is yatra main ab tak anusoochitjaati ke logon kii hissedari kii parampara nahin rahi he or rajya sarkaar kii is aayojan main bhagidaari sidhe-sidhe na keval saamanti vyavastha ko balki chuaachhut kii buraai ko bhi manyata detii he

 According to Nanda, Parvati is the daughter of Himalayas and her in-laws are also considered to be Kailash
 isaliye vah khason yaa khasiyon kii pracheenatam aradhy devi he
 There is evidence of this visit from the reign of the Katyuri dynasty before the Panwar dynasty
 dow dabraal aadi ke anusaar rupkund durghatana san 1150 main huyi thi jisamen rajajat main shaamil hone pahunche kannauj naresh jasdhaval yaa yashodhaval or unki patni rani ballabha kii suraksha or manoranjan aadi ke liye sekadon kii sankhya main saath laaye huye dalbal kii maut ho gayi thi
 Whose skeletons are still scattered in Roop Kund
 nauti main rajajat ke san 1843, 1863, 1886, 1905, 1925, 1951, 1968 evam 1987 main yojit hone ke abhilekh uplabdh hai
 It is clear from the prevailing belief that this yatra does not leave every 12 years
 kurud se praapt abhilekhon main 1845 tathaa 1865 kii rajajaton kaa vivaran he
 The priests of Kurud and most historians consider Nanda to be the oldest pilgrimage of khasas, not of pawars
 isi aadhaar par ayudhjivi khason kii aradhy kurud kii nanda devi kii doli hi is rajajat kaa netritv karti rahi he
 The trek to the high Himalayas increases the thrill of travelers as well
 iskaa pehla padaav 10 kilometre par ida badhaani he
 Two stops are then in Nauti
 nauti ke baad saim, koti, bhagoti, kulsari, chepadiyun, nandakeshari, faldiya gaanv, mundoli, wan, gaerolipaatal, pataranchauniyan hote huye yatra shilasamudr hote huye apane gantavya homkund pahunchati he
 After pinddaan and puja archana in this kund, the yatra begins to descend after the Chasingya Khadu leaves the Himalayan peaks
 uske baad yatra sutol, ghat or nauti laut aati he
 During this journey, Lohajung is such a place where even today large stones and trees have pierced iron arrows
 kuch tir sangrahalayon ke liye nikaal liye gayi hai
 This place is predicted to be a fierce battle
 isi maarg par 17500 foot kii oonchai par junragali bhi he jise paar karnaa bahut hi jokhim kaa kaam he
 Historians believe that at some time people used to jump from the same place towards Mahaprayan towards Roopkund
 yamuna dutt vaishnav ne ise mrityu gali kii sangya di he
 The skeletons of hundreds of passengers killed in the accident as well as those who jumped down from here have been found in Roopkund, which has been confirmed by DNA
 iske baad yatra shila samudr kii ore neeche utarati he
 The view of the sunrise of the rock sea is light
 vahaan se saamne kii nandaghanghati chotii par surya kii lau dikhne ke saath hi teen dipakon kii lau aalokik najaara pesh karti he
 Roopkund Lake is surrounded by snow-capped peaks on the route of Rajajat, to solve the mystery of which scientists from many countries of the world have been studying for decades
 koi roak tok na hone ke kaaran samudratal se 16200 foot kii unchai par sthit rupkund jhil se desh videsh ke vaigyanik boron main bhar kar ateet ke rahasyon kaa khajaana samete huye ye nar kankal or anya avshesh uthaa kar le gayi hai
 Nevertheless, many skeletons still lie on the banks of this lake far above human settlements
 kuch kankalon par maance tak paaya gaya he
 Along with skeletons, jewelery, Rajasthani shoes, betel nuts, stained teeth, shellfish, conch bangles etc
 are scattered
 in sekadon kankalon kaa pataa sabase pehle 1942 main ek van ranger ne lagaaya tha
 The skeletons of this lake were first studied by American scientist Dr
 James Graffin in 1957
 us samay usne in kankalon kii umr lagbhag 650 bataai thi
 What is shocking is revealed by the 2004 National Geographic Channel testing of these skeletons conducted in laboratories in Britain and Germany, that these skeletons belong to the 9th century and that they are all dead at the same time
 inamen sthaneey logon ke kankal bahut kam hai
 The rest are almost all of the same species
 inamen do khopadiyaan aisi bhi mili hai jo ki maharashtra kii ek khaas brahman jati ke diene tathaa sir ke kankal kii banaavat se milte hai
 The channel has come to the conclusion that these skeletons must have been of Yashodhaval, his queens, dancers, soldiers, sevadars or kaharas and the two Brahmins running together
 san 1947 main bharat ke aaazaad hone ke tatkaal baad 500 se adhik rajavaade loktantr kii mukhya dhara main villin ho gayi
 The remaining princely state of Garhwal King Manvendra Shah also merged with the Union of India in 1949
 rajshahi ke jamaane se chal rahi saamanti vyavastha ke thokdaar, padaan, sayane or kameen aadi bhi uttarapradesh jameendaari vinaash evam bhoomi sudhaar adhinium 1950 ke lagu ho jane or nayi panchayat raaj vyavastha ke lagu ho jane ke baad apraasangik ho gayi
 But the power of the younger brother of the king of hundreds of years ago still exists
 ek gaanv ke logon ke purakhon kaa sabhi yatriyon se tarpan karaane par bhi sawaal uthne lage hai
 According to historians like Shivraj Singh Rawat, Rajajat does not mean the feudal journey or the journey of the king, but the journey of Rajarajeshwari
 is kshetra main nanda devi ko rajrajeshwari ke naam se bhi pukaara jaataa he
 Supporters of the Samanti tradition claim that the people of Kansuva village are the descendants of Garhwal Naresh Ajay Pal
 ve maanate hai ki raja ne jab chandpur gadhi se rajdhani badal di to consuva main rahane vaala uskaa chota bhai vahiin rah gaya
 That is why the people of that village write their caste Kanwar
 bharat ke kisi bhi naagarik ko apni jati kuch bhi likhane kii aazaadee he
 One can also write himself a Emperor, but he does not become a Emperor
 is yatra ke sarvesarva swayan ko rajkunvar likh rahe hai to unako isaki bhi aazaadee he magar unhen rajkumaar kii tarah praja se pesh aane kii aazaadee nahin he
 Normally, Rajkumar, born of the same mother, does not leave the royal family and stop in the village to do farming or farming
 vahaan rukne vaale raajkanvar kaa naam bhi koi nahin jaanata
 As such, kings had many wives, and all the wives or sub-wives of the king had no children of kings
 itihaasavetta captain shoorveer singh panvar ke anusaar ajaypal panvar vansheey raajaaon kii kadi main 37 waan raja tha
 According to the history of Garhwal written by Pandit Harikrishna Raturi, Ajaypal shifted the capital from Chandpur Garhi to Devalgarh in 1512
 uttrakhand ke kai buddhijivi lagbhag 500 saal pehle ke kisi raja ke bhai ke kuch banshjon dwaara ab bhi swayan ko rajkunvar bataaye jane ko ataarkik or saamanti soch bataate hai
 They believe that thousands of princes would have been born from Ajaypal to the last king Manvendra Shah and today their number of descendants would have been in millions
 magar unamem se koi bhi swayan ko rajkunvar nahin kehalaata or naa hi kshetra ke anya logon se raja kii tarah bartaav karata he
 Even the cousin of Maharaja Manvendra Shah or other brothers of the family do not call themselves Rajkunwar
 vastav main yah kaise sambhav he ki chandpur gadhi chhodane ke baad paidaa hone vaale raajaaon ke bhai paidaa huye hi na hon
 In fact, as the distance from Rajmahal increased, the Panwar dynasty later changed their castes to Bartwal, Panwar, Parmar, Rawat and Kanwar etc
 himalayan jilon ke gajetir main iti atkinson ne kuch vidwaanon dwaara sankalit gadhwal nareshon kii suchi di gayi he
 Of these, Ajaypal is not named among the 61 kings in Hardwik's list
 hardvik ne kuch surat singh, ramdev, mangasen, chinaman, ramnarayan, premnath, ramru or fateh shah jaise kai naam diye hai jisase yah pataa nahin chalata ki in raajaaon kaa sambandh ek hi vansh rahaa hoga
 In the list of Bekt, 54 names have been given to Pradyuman Shah in the series of kings
 jinamein ajaypal kaa naam 37wein sthaan par he
 Ajaypal is named 35th in the list compiled by Williams
 atkinson dwaara almoda ke ek pandit se hasil suchi main ajaypal kaa naam 36 wein sthaan par he
 Atkinson himself has said that these were the kings who achieved some fame or were recorded in history for certain things

 Isopanishad Shukla is a Upanishad under the Yajurvedic branch
 yah upanishad apane nanhen kalevar ke kaaran anya upanishdon ke bich behad mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 There is no story in it, only self-description
 is upanishad ke pehle shloke ‘‘eshavasyamidansarvanyatkinch jagatyaan-jagat


’’ se lekar atharahawein shloke ‘‘agne nay suptha raye asman vidhwani dev vaunani vidvan


’’ tak shabd-shabd main maanon brahm-varnan, upasna, prarthana aadi zankrut he
 There is only one voice - of Brahman, of knowledge, of self-knowledge
 adbhut kalevar vaale is upanishad main ishwar ke sarvanirmaataa hone kii baat he saare brahmad ke maalik ko ingit kiya gaya he, satvik jeevanstyli kii baat kahi gai he ki duusare ke dhan par drushti mat daalo
 While living in this world, we have been told to live lifelessly
 isamen ‘asurya’ naamak lok kii baat aati he — asurya matlab ki surya se rahit lok
 The world where the sun cannot reach, the ultimate world filled with thick, dark darkness, that is, the womb
 kaha gaya he ki jo log aatm ko, apane ‘swa’ ko nahin pahachaanate hai, aatma ko jhuthla dete hai, nakaar dete hai or isi asweekaar tale puraa jivan bitaate hai unhen mrityu ke pashchaat usee andhtam lok yani ki asurya naamak lok main janaa padataa he arthath garbhavas karnaa padataa he, phir se janm lenaa padataa he
 Thus in this Upanishad, on the one hand, considering God as the Creator, on the other hand, indicates to live life by becoming a mere instrument, which on the other hand indicates not to forget self
 iske baad aatm ko nirupit karne kaa tathy aata he ki ‘vah’ achal he saath hi man se bhi zyada tivrgami he
 This self is a fast escape from all senses
 is upanishad main aatm / brahm ko 'maatarijva' naam se ingit kiya gaya he, jo ki sabhi kaaryakalapon ko vahan karne vaala, unhen sambal dene vaala he
 In order to describe the qualities of Brahma of 'atma', it is here that he is simultaneously, at the same time, wandering, as well as intransitive
 vah paas he or dur bhi
 Here he is indicated by several speeches - that he is omnipotent, bodiless, omniscient, self-born and the ruler of the mind
 is upanishad main vidya evam avidya donon kii baat kii gai he unke alag-alag kism ke gunon ko bataaya gaya he saath hi vidya evam avidya donon kii upasna ko varjit kiya gaya he — yahan yah saaf-saaf kaha gaya he ki vidya evam avidya donon kii upasna karne vaale ghaney andhkaar main jaakar girte hai saakaar kii prakruti kii upasna ko bhi yahan varjit mana gaya he lekin haan vidya evam avidya ko ek saath jaan lene vaala, avidya ko samajhakar vidya dwaara anushthanit hokar mrityu ko paar kar letaa he, vah mrityu ko jitkar amritatv kaa upbhog karata he yah sweekaarokti yahan he
 In this, considering both goodness and perishable, it is said that the attainment of indestructible element and consumption of nectar is said
 is upanishad ke antim shlokon main bade hi sundar upmaan aate hai — brahm ke mukh ko suvarna paatr se tanke hone kii baat saath hi surya se poshan karne vaale se prarthana kii
 Stitching from the suvarnapatra, the face of that self should be exposed so that the worshiper can understand, feel that the Kavah itself is Brahmarupa and all the deeds performed in the last verses come to be remembered by the mind and pray to Agni Once the physical body is transformed into ashes, it will orient it towards the ultimate destination from the divine path

 Male and Narayana, sons of Dharma, Balkhilyagana, son of Kratu, Kardam, son of Pulah, Kubera, son of Pulastya, Achal, son of Pratyush, Narada, son of Kashyapa and Parvat Devarshi are considered, but only the public knows Narada as Devarshi
 
 unki jaisi prasiddhi kisi or ko nahin mili
 All the symptoms of Devarshi mentioned in Vayu Purana occur completely in Naradji
 mahabharat ke sabhaparv ke paanchaven adhyay main naarad ji ke vyaktitv kaa parichay is prakaar diya gaya he - devarshi naarad veda or upanishdon ke marmajna, devataaon ke poojya, itihaas-puraanon ke visheshgy, purv kalpon kii baton ko jaanane vaale, nyaay evam dharm ke tatvajna, shiksha, vyakaran, ayurveda, jyotish ke prakand vidwaan, sangeet-vishaarad, prabhaavshaalee vaktaa, medhaavi, nitijna, kavi, mahapandit, brihaspati jaise mahavidwanonki shankaaon kaa samaadhaan karne vaale, dharm-arth-kaam-moksh ke yatharth ke gyaata, yogabal se samast lokon ke samachar jaan sakane main samarth, sankhya evam yoga ke sampoorn rahasy ko jaanane vaale, devataaon-daityon ko vairaygy ke upadeshak, karttavya-akarttavya main bhed karne main daksh, samast shastron main praveen, sadgunon ke bhandar, sadachaar ke aadhaar, anand ke sagar, param tejasvi, sabhi vidyaon main nipun, sabake hitkaari or sarvatra gati vaale hai
 One Naradokta Purana among the eighteen Mahapuranas; Brihannaradiya is known as Purana
 matsaypurana main varnit he ki shri naarad ji ne brihatkalp-prasang main jin anek dharm-aakhyayikaon ko kaha he, 25,000 shlokon kaa vah mahagranth hi naarad mahapurana he
 The Narada Purana available at the present time has 22,000 shlokas

 inamen jyotish ke teenon skandh-siddhant, hora or samhita kii sarvangin vivechna kii gai he
 Another book available in the name of Naradasamhita also gives a detailed description of all subjects of astrology
 isse yah siddh ho jaataa he ki devarshinarad bhakthi ke saath-saath jyotish ke bhi pradhan acharya hai
 Nowadays the character-portrayal of Narada in religious movies and serials is being done, he is completely dwarfed in front of the greatness of Devarshi
 naarad ji ke paatr ko jis prakaar se prastut kiya ja rahaa he, usase aam aadmi main unki chhavi ladai-jhagadaa karwaane vaale vyakti athwa vidooshak kii ban gai he
 This is a gross injustice to his erudite erudition and great personality
 naarad ji kaa uphaas udaane vaale srihari ke in anshavatar kii avmaananaa ke doshi he
 Narada ji has become his exclusive ally in most of the leelas of God
 ve bhagwaan ke parshad hone ke saath devataaon ke pravaktaa bhi hai
