 SI ko 1960 main puraani meter-kilogram-sacond yani pranali se viksit kiya gaya tha, bajaay centimetre-gram-sacond pranali kii, jisamen kai kathinaaiyaan thim
 The SI system does not remain stable, but it continues to evolve, but units are created and changed only through international agreements

 But exceptions are the United States and Britain, where non-si units still have their old systems
 bharat mein yah pranali 1 april, 1957 mein lagu hui
 Along with this, new money was also introduced here, which was based on the decimal system itself
 is pranali main kai nai namakaran kii gai ikaiyaan lagu hui
 There are seven basic units in this system and many other derived units

 It is easy to express very small and very large quantities through SI prefixes

 How definitions of certain critical units are implemented is given on the BIPM website
 An SI derived unit unique form is defined only as SI root units

 On April 7, 1795, gramme and kilogramme replaced the old terminology "gravet" and "grave"
 10 disambar, 1799 ko, metric pranali ko sthai rup se france main apanaaya gaya
 The metric system being used around the world has seen many changes today

 Many different measurement systems were in use around the world until after World War II
 inamen se kai pranaliyaan, metric pranali kii hi bhinnak thi, jabaki anya yaa to imperium pranali yaa phir amareeki pranali par aadhaarit thim
 Then the need was proved that all these should be metered, so that a worldwide measurement system can be created

 Based on the results of this study, the Tenth CGPM decided in 1954 to derive an international system from six basic units that could provide measurements of mechanical and electromagnetic quantities as well as temperature and optical radiation

 In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units or the International System of Units, abbreviated as SI, originally from French: Le Système international d'unités
 The seventh parent unit, the mole or the mole, was added to the 14th CGPM in 1971

 intaraashtriya ikai pranali main ikaayiyon kaa samooh he, jiske sadash hi upsargon ke samooh bhi hai
 SI units can be divided into two subgroups: - in ikaayiyon ke saath hi To create multiples of the root unit, the SI prefix can be added
 sabhi gunak das kii purna sankhya ghaat ke hai
 For example, kilo- = sahasra or thousand milli - = thousandth part i

 one meter has one hazards millimeters, plus one thousand meters to one kilometer
 upsargon ko milaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 a milligram is a millionth of a kilogram, but it will not be called a micro-kilogram

 Transfer factors are used to transfer between units

 Specific gravity is often represented in SI units, or in the context of water
 kyonki ek ghan jiske naap hai 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, uski aaytan hogi 1000 cm3, jo baraabar he 1 l ke; or jab jal se bharaa jaye, to uskaa bhaar 1 kg hota he, atev pani kii spacific gravity he 1 g / cm3 or yah 0 degree celsius par jam jaayegaa
 The metric system has received worldwide support as a means of means and daily commerce
 iskaa kaaran bahut had tak yah bhi tha ki kai deshon main rudhigat pranaaliyon main kai siddhanton ko samajhane kaa samarthy nahin thi
 At the same time, by standardizing regional changes, a world-wide system, which is universally accepted, was created
 isse anterrashtriya vyapaar ko bhi badhaava mila
 From a scientific point of view, the use of decimal can also be described as very large and very small units

 In many cases this change is BIPM

 But on 11 September 2007, the EU declared that the UK was exempted from this directive and that their imperial system would still be infinitely valid, along with the metric system
