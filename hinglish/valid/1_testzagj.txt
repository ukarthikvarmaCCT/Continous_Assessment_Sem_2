 There is a rajaloka, 2,057,152 yojas per time for six months by a deity
 If an iron ball of 1000 weight is dropped from heaven, Indra's house at six months free speed, it can be considered equal to the distance traveled from it
 saat rajju = ek jagashrenee One bigha is equal to: shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 taili paramparaagat rup se bharat, pakistan or nepal main tel perne or bechney vaali jati he
 Members can be either Hindu or Muslim; The Muslim Teli is called Roshandar or Teli Malik

 Telia is considered related to Vaishya in Hinduism
 kuch vishesh sthanon ke log apane ko kshatriyo se sambandhit karte hai, jabaki puraanon main inhen vaisya varg main hi varnit kiya he
 Teli caste is also mentioned in ancient texts and popular stories, which shows that it is very ancient of Vaishyas

 He had a very respected place in society

 In Rajasthan, Teli has Kshatriya status maharashtra ke bene israel ko sthaneey janasamudaay dwaara shanivar taili kaa upnaam diya gaya kyonki ve shanivaar ko kaam se bache the, jo yahudee dharm kaa shaabaat tha
 The modh-ghanchi community of Gujarat is described as the "counterpart" of Teli

 Initially, they failed to achieve this in India's official positive discrimination scheme, with opposition coming from other groups who considered Teli too populous and socio-economically influential and justified the change
 april 2015 main, bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bihar main atyant pichhadaa varg kii suchi main taili jati ko shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya
 In 2004, the Jharkhand government recommended granting status to the Tallii caste of scheduled tribes in Jharkhand under Arjun Munda, but the move did not materialize as of 2015
 2014 main, raghuvar das jharkhand ke pehle taili mukhyamantri bane File transfer protocol is a network protocol through which files are exchanged over an Internet-based TCP / IP network
 ise upayokta aadhaarit kuta yaa anonimas yujar acces ke dwaara kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Now with FTP servers in almost every institution, this system does not work
 anek haal ke web broujar or file prabandhak apatpi sarvaron se jud sakate hai
 This can do the same thing as local files on files coming from remote locations
 isamen apatpi yuarel prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Other methods of sending files such as SFTP and SCP are not associated with FTP
 inaki puri prakriya main esaech kaa prayog hota he
 The File Transfer Protocol or FTP in its current form has arrived at various stages
 sarvapratham 16 april, 1971 main ise refsi 114 ke naam se taiyaar kiya gaya tha jise baad main june, 1980 main refsi 765 se badla gaya jise san aktubar 1985 main refsi 959 se parivartit kiya gaya
 After that, many security related changes came
 ye suraksha sambandhi badlaav isliye laae gaye the kyonki aarambh main sanchikaayen bhejne kaa yah tarika bahut asurakshit tha
 The main reason for this vulnerability was that anyone could steal or copy that file on the same network in the process of sending the file
 achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet se purv yah internet protocol ke kaaryakshetra main aane vaali ek aam samasya bani hui thi
 This problem was possible only through SFTP
 apatpi ko sakriy mod, niskriy mod or vistrut niskriy mod main sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 In September 1998 by RFC 2428, extended passive mode was added
 network par data antarit karte samay, kai data pratinidhitiv kiye ja sakate hai
 There are two most common transfer modes: FTP sarwar vaapasi code, apane bheetar ke ankon dwaara apni sthiti suchit karte hai
 The basic FTP specification is an inherently unsafe method of transferring files, as there is no specified method of transferring data in an encrypted manner
 iskaa arth yah he ki adhikansh network vinyason ke antargat, prayokta naam, password, afatipi cmand or antarit sanchikaayen, ek packet sansuchak ke upyog dwaara usee network par avasthit koi bhi antarit sanchikaon ko hathiyaa saktaa he
 This has been a common problem for many Internet protocol specifications written prior to the creation of SSL such as HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet
 is samasya ke liye aam samaadhaan he esaftipi, yaa apatpies, jo arefasi 4217 main vinirdisht tareeqe se afatipi main esasail yaa tles ancripshan jodate hai
 a host providing FTP service is additionally capable of providing anonymous FTP access
 prayokta naam ke liye puche jane par, prayokta saamaanya taur par 'anaam' khate kii seva main log-in karte hai
 Although users are generally asked to send their e-mail address in lieu of a password, little or no verification of the supplied information is done
 chunki aadhunik afatipi client aam taur par prayokta se anaam pravesh prakriya ko chhupate hai, afatipi client, password ke rup main nakli data kii aapurti kar sakate hai kyonki anuprayog ko prayokta kaa i-mail pataa gyaat nahin ho saktaa he
 The Gopher protocol, as well as the simple file transfer protocol and file service protocol, have been suggested as an alternative to anonymous FTP
 jahaan apatpi acces prayog main nahin aata, vahaan doorvarti yaa remote apatpi yaa apatpi mail prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this, an email is sent to another FTP server that completes the FTP command and sends back an attachment containing the download file
 yah khaskar vahaan prayog main laayaa jaataa he, jahaan FTP pahunch pratibandhit ho
 An e-mail containing the FTP command to be executed is sent to the remote FTP server
 yah ek mail sarwar hota he jo aavak i-mail ko pars karata he, afatipi commandon ko karyanvit karata he or atachament ke rup main downlod kiye gaye kisi sanchika ke saath i-mail waapas bhejtaa he
 This is obviously less flexible than an FTP client, as directories cannot be seen interacting or modifying commands, and replies may also have problems with large file attachments escaping through the mail server
 aajkal adhikansh internet prayoktaaon ke paas afatipi kaa pahunch sulabh he, atah yah prakriya dainandin upyog main prachlit nahin he
 Currently modern and recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers, although they may lack support for protocol extensions such as FTPS
 yah afatipi par doorvarti sanchikaon kii adla-badali main sthaneey sanchikaon ke liye prayukt interfes jaise madhyam ko anumat karata he
 This is done by an FTP URL
 yah is rup main hota he: Alternatively a password can be provided in the URL, eg: adhikansh web brouzaron ko niskriy mod afatipi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jisase puraa karne hetu sabhi afatipi sarwar sakasham nahin hai
 Some browsers only allow files to be downloaded, but do not provide any means to upload files to the server
 ypi pate or port cmand par port sankhyaon kaa pratinidhitiv or pieesavi uttar, network pataa anuwaad upkarnon ke liye FTP se nipatane main ek or chunauti he
 These values have to be changed by the NAT tool, so that they include the IP address of the nat-ed client and the port selected by the NAT device for the data connection
 nayaa pataa or port sambhawatah unke dashamalav pratinidhitiv kii lambaai main apane mul pate or port se alag hon
 This means that the value on the control connection must be carefully changed, with the NAT tool changing the TCP sequence and acknowledgment fields for all subsequent packets
 adhikansh NAT upkarnon main aam taur par is tarah ke anuwaad nahin kiye jate hai, balki is uddeshy ke liye vishesh anuprayog stareey get-ve uplabdh rahete hai
 FTP over SSH refers to the use of creating a normal FTP session container over an SSH connection
 afatipi ek se adhik tisipi conekshnon kaa upyog karata he, atev esaech par tunnel bananaa vishesh rup se kathin hota he
 As with many SSH clients, attempting to prepare the tunnel for the control channel would only protect the channel; When data is transferred, FTP software on both ends will establish TCP connections, which will pass over the SSH connection to the bypass, thus securing privacy, integrity protection, etc
 anyathaa, esaech client software ke liye afatipi protocol kaa vishisht gyaan or afatipi niyantran sandeshon kii nigaraanee or punarlekhan tathaa swytt rup se afatipi data channelon ke liye nae agreshan kholana aavashyak hota zaruri he
 Version 3 of SSH Communications Security's software parikar and FONC licensed by GPL are two software packages that support this mode
 SSH kii apeksha FTP ko kabhi-kabhi surakshit FTP ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he; ise FTP surakshit karne kii SSL / TLS jaisi anya paddati nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Other methods of transferring files using SSH include SFTP and SCP, which are not related to FTP; In each of these, the entire conversation is always protected by the SSH protocol

 Located outside the village, it is the remains of the 11th century temple hall

 This is another Hindu temple situated in the village itself
 kaha jaataa he ki is mandir ko ek aurat ne udayeshwar mandir main kaam kar rahe, kaarigaron ke liye aataa piskar kamaaye gayi dhan se banaaya
 However, this does not seem completely true from the architectural style of the temple, which seems to be much later

 kurd or kalaan farsi bhashaa ke shabd hai jo hindi main or bhartiya upmahadweep main kai sandarbhon main paae jate hai, visheshkar jagahon ke naamon main
 "khurd" means "small" and "kalan" means big
 in naamon ko mughaliya jamaane se prayog kiya ja rahaa he
 The word Khurd was applied behind small towns and villages
 farsi ke is shabd kaa arth hota he chota
 This Khurd is made from Sanskrit petty, which has a feeling of smallness, smallness or subtlety
 desh bhar main khurd dhari gaanvon kii taadaad hajaaron main he
 Similarly, the word Kalan is associated with many villages like Kosi Kalan, Bamaniya Kalan
 jis tarah khurd shabd chote yaa laghu kaa paryaay bana usee tarah kalam shabd bade yaa vishaal kaa paryaay bana
 Kalan was used in almost the same sense as the word Greater India was used in ancient times for India which covered the entire territory from Burma to Iran
 haalanki kisi yatravrit main hindustan kalam jaisaa shabd nahin miltaa
 When Greater Britain was talked about, there was a reference to its colonies
 isi tarah kalam shabd kii arthvatta bhi gramin aabaadiyon ke sandarbh main mahatvapurn he
 Kalan is basically a Persian word meaning senior, big, tall or huge
 vaise isaki vyutpatti agyaat he
 In some contexts it is said to belong to the Semitic language family and is associated with the greatness of God
 kalam kii arthvatta ke aadhaar par yah thik he magar isaki pushti kisi semetic dhaatu se nahin hoti
 The word Kalan was not only used to describe the status of places but also the names of individuals such as Mirza Kalan or Amir Kalan al-bukhari which means the great rich of Bukhara
 jaahir he yahaan kalam shabd kaa arth mahaan he
 The glory of naming settlements during the Muslim reign does not end here
 kai gaanvon ke naamon ke saath bujurg shabd laga miltaa he jaise sonpipari bujurg 
 Apparently, in order to differentiate from Hamnam village, a settler was considered senior and before him, an old man was placed and Sonpipuri Khurd
 aisi kai gramin bastiyaan hajaaron kii sankhya main hai
 Similarly, the word jagir was attached to it, given the specific status of a village

 katappa apni kahani sunanaa jari rakhata he ki kis prakaar usne bahubali ko maaraa


 After winning from Kalakeya, Amarinder Bahubali is declared the future king and Bhallal Dev as commander in Mahishmati
 rajbhishek hone se purv hi amarendra kii maan shivgami uske liye dulhan kii talash karne lagati he
 She tells Amarendra and Katappa to visit it to understand the state of the empire and its people
 amarendra ko kuntal samrajya kii rajkumaari or uske raja kii bahan, devsena se pyaar ho jaataa he
 Bhallal comes to know that Amarendra has fallen in love with Devasena
 iske baad vah shivgami se kahata he ki vah devsena se shaadi karnaa chahta he
 Shivgami is not aware that Amarendra loves Devasena, so she promises to marry him to Devasena
 jab shivgami shaadi kaa prastaav kuntal rajya ko bhejti he to doot us prastaav ko is prakaar likhata he jaise kisi ghamandi vyakti ne likhaa he
 Devasena refuses this marriage proposal with strong words
 jab shivgami ko uskaa uttar miltaa he to vah krodh main devsena ko bandi bana kar laane kaa aadesh de detii he
 The Kuntal Empire gets attacked by the Pigeonies
 devsena ke bhai kumaar verma kii sahaayta se amarendra us hamale ko vifal kar detaa he or kuntal ko bachaa letaa he
 Amarendra tells him who he is and tries to overcome the fear of Shivagami's anger and persuade him to become his bride
 jab wo mahismati pahunchataa he, tab use galatfahami kaa pataa chalata he
 Sivagami speaks of him choosing the throne or one of the Devasena
 vah devsena ko chunata he
 Due to this, Bhallal is made the king of the place and yet Amarendra is considered the king over the commander
 devsena kii god bharaai ke liye amarendra ko bhallaal ne senapati ke kaary se chuttee de di thi, jisase vah apni patni ke saath rah sake
 At the same time Devasena speaks against the manipulation of King Bhallal and also questions Sivagami's silence
 is kaaran jhagada shuru ho jaataa he or un donon ko mahal se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 They both started living happily among the people outside, but Bhallal again provokes Shivagami that Amarendra wants to kill him and also says that if he takes direct action civil war can start
 is kaaran shivgami uski seva karne vaale sevak katappa se bolti he ki vah sankat main he or use amarendra ko maarna he
 At the behest of Sivagami, Katappa attacked Amarendra with deceit and killed him
 phir katappa aa kar shivgami ko suchit karata he ki amarendra bahubali kii maut ho gai he
 Devasena also comes there with his child Mahendra Bahubali and he too gets to know about this
 shivgami mahal ke baahar ghabaraai hui bheed ko bataati he ki amarendra mar chukaa he or ab uskaa putr mahendra bahubali nayaa raja hoga
 After this Bhallal and his men together try to capture Devasena and his child and put him in jail
 devsena apane bachche ko sivaagaamee ko saunp detii he jo ki bhaagane main safal rahati he, lekin devsena apane aap ko nahin bachaa paati
 He is imprisoned

 International relations is the study of relations between different countries, as well as the role of sovereign states, inter-governmental organizations, international ngos, non-governmental organizations and multinationals
 anterrashtriya sambandh ko kabhi-kabhi 'antararashtriya adhyayan' ) ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, haalanki donon shabd puri tarah se paryaay nahin hai
 In simple terms, 'international politics' means 'doing politics among states'
 yadi 'raajnneeti' ke arth kaa adhyayan karen to teen pramukh tatv saamne aate hai - samoohon kaa astitv; samoohon ke bich sahmati; tathaa samoohon dwaara apane hiton kii purti
 If we assess this effect internationally, then these three elements are mainly - the existence of states; Conflict between states; And the use of power to fulfill their national interests
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti un kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa he jiske antargat rajya apane raashtra hiton kii purti hetu shakti ke aadhaar par sangharshrat rahete hai
 In this context, national interests are the main goals of international politics; Conflict sets its direction; And Shakti is considered as the main means of achieving this objective
 parantu uparyukt paribhaasha ko ham paramparaagat maan sakate hai, kyonki aaj ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ kaa sthaan isse vyapak avadharana ‘antarrashtriya sambandhon’ ne le liya he
 Under this, along with mutual conflict of states, the collaborative aspects are now studied under international politics
 iske atirikt aaj ‘rajyon’ ke alaava anya kai kaarak bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vishay kshetra ban gaye hai
 Therefore, under this, individuals, institutions, organizations and many other non-state units have also joined
 iskaa vartmaan aadhaar va vishay kshetra aaj kaaphi vyapak swaroop le chukaa he
 Before discussing all these topics, it becomes very essential to review the following definitions given by different scholars- in paribhaashaon kaa dayera ati simit he, kyonki iske antargat multah ‘rajyon’ ko hi anterrashtriya raajnneeti ke kaarak ke rup main mana gaya he
 It is limited to the nature of international politics
 mukhya rup se hence je
 margenthau, herald spraoot, bone doyak, thampsan aadi iske mukhya samarthak hai jo inaki nimna paribhaashaon se spasht ho jaataa he- International definitions discuss the broad nature of international politics, international relations
 isamen rajya ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke naveen karkon jaise antarrashtriya sanghathan, deshaantar samooh, gaiyr sarkari sanghathan, antarrashtriya santhaayen, kuch vyaktiyon aadi ko bhi sammilit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, along with the struggle, cooperation and politics, as well as directly or indirectly affecting it, ie, cultural, religious, social, science and technical aspects are also mentioned
 vibhinn lekhakon kii nimnlikhit paribhaashaon se yah aashay ati spasht rup main ujagar ho jaataa he- In this way the nature of international politics becomes very broad from the beginning to the present
 isamen aaj raashtra rajyon ke saath vibhinn vishwa ikaayiyon evam sanghathanon ke adhyayan kaa samavesh ho chukaa he
 But even after all these changes, the focal point of these studies is still a nation state
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ke bare main nimna nishkarsh saamne aate hai
 Therefore, the nature of international politics is variable
 jab-jab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke parivesh, karkon va ghatnakram main parivartan aayegaa, iske adhyayan karne ke tareekon va drushtikonon main bhi parivartan anivaary he
 Additionally, this change is continuous rather than permanent
 iske saath-saath vibhinn karkon, staron, ayaamon aadi ke kaaran yah bahut jatil he atah iske sucharu adhyayan hetu bahut spasht, tarksangat, vyapak drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As is known from the above definitions and form, the subject area of international politics is increasing
 aaj iskaa vishay kshetra kaaphi vyapak ho gaya he jiske antargat nimnlikhit baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he- Therefore, today the subject area of international politics is very broad and complex and is moving towards development
 iske antargat vibhinn paramparaagat karkon ke saath-saath gaiyr-paramparaagat karkon kaa adhyayan bhi mahatvapurn hota ja rahaa he
 The history of the development of international politics is not very ancient, rather the subject is a product of the twentieth century
 spasht rup se dekha jaae to velj vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya woodro wilson peeth kii 1919 main sthapana se hi iskaa itihaas prarambh hota he

 isi samay anya vishvavidhyalayon evam sansthaanon main bhi isi prakaar kii vyavasthaaen dekhne ko mili
 Therefore, if we look at the history of this subject in the last one century, then along with the ups and downs in this subject, information about its establishment in an autonomous subject is available
 is vishay main aaye bahuaiami parivartanon ne jahaan ek ore vishaywastu kaa sanvardhan, samanvay tathaa vikaas kiya he, vahiin duusari ore vibhinn siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karke bahut si jatil samasyaon evam pahaluon ko samajhane main sahaayta pradaan kii he
 Kenneth Thompson in his 1962 review, Review of Politics, has divided the history of international politics into four parts, on the basis of which a clear and sure study of this subject can be possible
 vikaas ke in chaar charnon main shityudhottar yug ke paanchaven charan ko bhi sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Their detailed description is as follows: pratham vishwayuddh se purv itihaas, kanoon, raajnneeti shaastra, darshan shaastra aadi ke vidwaan hi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke alag-alag pahaluon par vichaar karte the
 It was mainly historians who studied it as diplomatic history and the history of relations with other countries
 iske antargat kootneetigyon va videsh mantriyon dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon kaa lekha jokha hota tha
 Hence, it is also known as diplomatic history
 i
ech
car ke anusaar pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh kaa sambandh keval sainikon tak samajha jaataa tha tathaa iske samakaksh antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa sambandh rajanyikon tak
 In addition, even in democratic countries, foreign policy was traditionally kept separate from party politics and the elected members also felt unable to control the foreign ministry
 1919 se purv is vishay ke prati udaseenta ke kai pramukh kaaran the - pratham, is samay tak yahi samajha jaataa tha ki yuddh va rajyon main gathbandhan usee prakaar swaabhaavik he jaise garibi va berogari
 Therefore, preventing war, foreign policy and mutual relations between states was considered out of the control of human power
 dwitiya, pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh itane bhayankar nahin hote the
 Third, in the absence of means of communication, international politics was limited to a few states
 is prakaar is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan kii sabase badi kami saamaanya hiton kaa vikaas rahaa
 In this period, only a descriptive study of diplomatic history was done
 parinamswaroop, isse na to vartmaan tathaa na hi bhavi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane main koi madad mili
 The quantum achievement of this era was the establishment of the Chair of the Study of International Politics at the University of Wales in 1919
 do vishwa yudhon ke bich ke kaal main do samaanaantar dhaaraon kaa vikaas hua
 The first of which emphasized the study of current events / problems, except for the dominance of earlier historicity
 iske saath saath ab aitihaasik raajnneetik adhyayan ko vartmaan raajnneetik sandarbhon ke saath jod kar dekhne kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 Despite the diminishing of historical influence, there still remains a lack of a holistic approach to the study of international politics
 is kaal main vartmaan ke adhyayan par to bahut bal diya gaya, lekin vartmaan evam ateet ke parsparik sambandh ke mahatv ko abhi bhi pahachaanaa nahin gaya
 In addition, neither was there an attempt to see post-war political problems with comparable problems of the past
 shaayad isiilie is yug main bhi do moolbhoot kamiyaan spasht rup se ujagar raheen
 First, like the first phase, universal principles could not develop in international politics even in this period
 dwitiya, aaj bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa adhyayan adhik suspasht evam tarksangat nahin ban paaya
 Thus, in this phase, there was not much change in the study of international politics except the change in the status of force, nor was the confirmation of this subject becoming an explicitly independent discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa tritiy charan bhi dwitiya charan ke samaanaantar do vishwa yudhon ke bich kaa kaal rahaa
 It is called the era of reformism because it envisaged reform of international politics through the establishment of the League of Nations by the states
 is yug main mukhya rup se sansthagat vikaas kiya gaya
 The scholars, diplomats, politicians and thinkers of this period believed that if international institutions are developed, then the problems of war and peace present in front of the world community will be possible
 is uddeshy hetu kuch kanoonee va naitik upagamon kii sanrachanaayen kii gai jinke nimna mukhya aadhaar the
 International organization was envisaged with emphasis on these ideals and moral values
 isaki sthapana ke uparant yah mana gaya ki ab antarrashtriya sambandhon main rajyon ke madhya shaanti banane kaa sangharsh samaapt ho gaya
 There will be no place of balance of power under the new system
 ab rajya apane vivaadon kaa nipataara sangh ke madhyam se karenge
 Therefore, in this era not only the problems of war and peace were discussed, but its far-reaching reforms were also thought of
 atah adhyayankartaaon ke mukhya bindu bhi kanoonee samasyaon va sanghathanon ke vikaas ke saath-saath inke madhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ko badalane vaala rahaa
 Finally, in this period more emphasis has been laid on emotional, imaginative and moral reformism
 parantu vishwayudhon ke bich in upagamon kii sarthakata par hameshaa prashn chihn laga rahaa
 While the first decade of United Nations activities showed a ray of hope, the economic situation of the second decade completely ended this notion
 badi shaktiyon ke madhya asahyog va gutbandiyon ne shaanti kii sthapana kii bajaay shakti sangharsh vyavastha ko janm diya
 While Japan invaded Manchuria and disrupted peace, Italy, Germany and Russia not only relinquished membership of the League in controversial situations, but also intensified the process of the start of World War II
 is prakaar shaanti, naitikta, va kanoon se vishwa vyavastha nahin chal saki, to i
ech
car, shumbha, quinci rhit aadi lekhakon ke kaaran yathartwaadee drushtikon ko vaikalpik upaagam ke rup main bal mila
 The fundamental changes in international politics at this stage not only broadened its content but also led to many complications
 shitayugin kaal main raajnneeti ke swaroop main parivartan tathaa naye rajyon ke udai ne sampoorn antarrashtriya parivesh ko hi badal diya
 As a result, new approaches, dimensions, institutions and trends were created through which the study of international relations was ensured
 purv charnon kii aadarshik, sansthagat, naitik, kanoonee evam sudhaarwadi dhaaraon kii asafalataaon ne naye upagamon ke vikaas kii ore agrasar kiya
 This new approach was realism
 vaise to i
ech
car, shwarjanbarger, quinci rhit, shubhaan aadi lekhakon ne is drushtikon ko viksit kiya, parantu hence je
 margenthau ne ise ek saamaanya siddhanth ke rup main prastut kiya
 According to this theory, states are always struggling to fulfill their interests
 atah anterrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane hetu is shakti sangharsh ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samajhnaa ati aavashyak he
 International organization also originated in the form of assured and unambiguous development of international institutions with realistic outlook
 ab is sanghathan kaa swaroop maatra adarshavaadi va sudhaarwadi na hokar, mahatvapurn raajnneetik sanghathan ke rup main ubhar kar aayaa
 Under this, apart from saving mankind from the ravages of war, what are the reasons for the conflict between the states? What are the risk factors for world peace? How can peace be established? How can arms race be stopped? Efforts were also made to find solutions to many types of questions
 uparokt do pravritiyon ke saath-saath vyavahaarwad kii utpatti bhi is yug kii mahatvapurn uplabdhi rahi
 An attempt was made to understand international politics by creating "system theory" through a pragmatic approach
 is upaagam ke antargat rajyon ke adhyayan hetu teen pramukh karkon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa zaruri mana gaya
 These factors were- uparokt pravritiyon kaa mukhya bal antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saiddhantikaran ko badhaava dena rahaa he
 Therefore, it has been a very important task in this era to propose the universal principles of international politics
 siddhanth nirmaan kii is prakriya ke parinaam swaroop anek aanshik siddhanton jaise - yatharthwaad, santulan kaa siddhanth, sanchaar siddhanth, krida siddhanth, saudebaaji kaa siddhanth, shaanti anusandhan drushtikon, vyavastha siddhanth, vishwa vyavastha pratimaan aadi kaa nirmaan hua
 Despite the rendering of these principles, there still remains a lack of any universal and common principle in this era
 1990 ke dashak main jaint bandhopadhyaay ne apni pustak - general theory of international rilations - main martin kaplan ke vyavasthaaparak siddhanth kii kamiyon ko dur kar ek saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana kii koshish kii he, parantu vah bhi abhi vaad-pratwaad ke daur main hi hai
 Therefore, despite the main phase of theorization, the era of the Cold War remained deprived of any one general principle due to its ideological narrowness and isolation
 shityudhottar yug main sabhi rashtron dwaara ek aarthik vyavastha ke antargat judana prarambh kar diya
 That is why the era of globalization, liberalization, free market system etc
 has started
 is sandarbh main na keval aarthik muddon kaa hi mahatv badha, apitu antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa mahatv or bhi bad gaya
 Today, the distinction of nationalism and internationalism has ended
 Apart from this, now the table of international politics has included a lot of new topics which, instead of being national, now emerge as problems of mankind
 vartmaan vishwa kii pramukh samasyaon main aatankwaad, paryaavaran, ozon parat ksheen hona, nashile padaarthon evam maadak dravyon kii taskari, maanavadhikaron kaa hanan aadi pramukh mudde ubhar kar saamne aaye jinka rashtriya str yaa kshetray str kii bajaay antarrashtriya str par hal nikaalnaa anivaary ban gaya he
 Even at the theoretical level, the attempt to establish the universal principle from 1945 to 1991 got a shock
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii is sandarbh main ab praathamiktaayen badal gai
 In post-modernism, the significance of universal principles are now being questioned
 aitihaasik sandarbh evam pracheen parivesh ke prabhaav ko bhi nakaara ja rahaa he
 Now the independent issues have become more important
 vrihat siddhanth gaun ho gaye hai
 Partial research has become more important in the new context
 udhaahranswaroop nariwad, maanavadhikaar, paryaavaran aadi vishyon par adhik bal dene ke saath-saath chintan bhi prarambh ho gaya he
 Therefore, in the post-cold War era, the nature, content and subject area of international politics have completely changed
 ab saamaanya saiddhanthik sthapana par bhi adhik bal nahin diya ja rahaa he
 That is why, in this changed environment, international politics seems to be not only important but also towards autonomy
 or vishay kii swaittata hetu ashaavadi sanket dikhaai dete hai
 The Second World War not only influenced international politics fundamentally, but also expressed many important issues
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke karkon main parivartan, karkon ko vyapak swaroop pradaan karnaa, naveen siddhanton kaa pratipaadan aadi anek vishyon ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa purna parivesh hi badal kar rakh diya he
 While there is a debate on the theoretical level of realism and idealism on the one hand, and on the ancient and scientific debate, on the other hand controversial questions were being raised about the format of international relations topic - whether international relations is a Autonomous subject or not? Although it is being taught as an autonomous subject at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and research in most universities today, it is not recognized as equivalent to other subjects of social science
 itnaa avashya hua he ki viksit deshon main to kai vishvavidhyalayon main ise purna rup se swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Developing countries like India have also improved
 yahaan prarambh main ‘bhartiya antarrashtriya sambandh skool, nai dilli’ jo baad main jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya sambandh skool ke rup main swytt rup se kaary kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, many other universities like Jadavpur University, Calcutta, Goa University etc
 have also got the status of autonomous subjects
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ko ek swytt vishay ke rup main adhyayan karne se purv ek baat spasht kerani ati aavashyak he ki jab ham is vishay kii swaittata ke prashn kaa adhyayan karte hai to ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ va antarrashtriya sambandhon ko alag-alag vishay nahin maanate hai
 This has been done because both disciplines are still recognized as a sub-discipline of the subject of political science rather than as an autonomous discipline
 duusare inkaa vibhed itnaa sookshm he ki anushaasan kii swaittata kii pramanikta ke baad is vishay ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In the context of considering international politics as an autonomous subject, three different views have been given which are as follows - jo vidwaan is vishay ko swytt maanate hai unke anusaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay vastu va anushaasan sambandhi saamagree ko dekhte hue ise ek swytt vishay mana janaa chahie
 The main proponents of this argument are - CAW
 Manning, Quincy Right, Robert Lotting Allen, Hannes J
 Margenthau, Carl M
 Copper Johnson, Hoffmann; AL Burn etc
 in vidwaanon ne nimna aadhaaron par ise swytt vishay pramanit kiya he- Those scholars who do not consider international politics as an autonomous subject, believe that there is no such unique thing in this subject that it should be considered autonomous for study
 unhone nimna tarko ke aadhaar par apni baat kaa samarthan kiya he- Some scholars consider both of the above debates as meaningless
 unka maananaa yah he ki uparyukt donon tarkon ko antarrashtriya raajnneeti main hue vikaas ke madhyam se adhik bhalee prakaar se janaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, a review of the development of the 20th century, and especially after 1945, is extremely essential
 yadi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii swaittata ke prashn kaa gahan adhyayan karte hai to pataa chalata he ki is sandarbh main do moolbhoot samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 One, there have been effective changes in the nature, content and methods of international relations
 doosraa, isi samay raajnneetishastra kii paridhi kii jatiltaaon evam aparibhaashit simaaon ke vikaas ke kaaran samasya or bad gai he
 But if we look at the development of international politics from 1919 till date, it is clear that its achievements will prove very helpful in giving it autonomy
 1919 ke baad se hi, visheshkar america main, bahut se vidwaanon ne is vishay ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane hetu prayaas kiye hai
 Efforts have also been made to explain its content, methods and principles

 After a review in this context, Richard Smythbeel has come to the conclusion that- dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad is sthiti main mahatvapurn parivartan aae hai
 On the one hand, on the one hand, based on new researches in this field, the international relations analytic relations have been strengthened, on the other hand new theories have also been formulated
 america main anek viddhanon mukhya rup se margenthau, richard snidar, martin kaplan, karl dablyoo dois, charles mekalaland aadi ne is ore vishisht yogadan diya he
 In addition, emphasis has been laid on the study of both developed and developing countries
 isaki vishay saamagree kaa sankalan, siddhanth pratipaadan evam paddatiyon kaa bhi kaaphi vikaas hua he
 But even today, the most important deficiency remains the lack of a universal / general principle
 shityudhottar vishwa main iskaa mahatv or bad gaya he
 In this era of globalization, all the states are getting connected with one type of economic system
 antarrashtriya va rashtriya mudde jaise paryaavaran, aatankwaad, nariwad, adj, ozon parat ksheen hona, maanavadhikaar aadi rashtriya kii bajaay maanviya / maanavjaati se sambhddha ho gaye hai
 Therefore, active participation of international forums / organizations is necessary to solve all these

 Therefore, on the basis of the development after 1945, it can be said to be leading to autonomy, which after 1991 the process of the end of the Cold War has tried to strengthen

 Armenian is a multiple adjective which can mean the following
 avasthaa-samshti nirupan, gatikeey tantron ke kai prakaar ke nirupanon main se ek he
 In fact, it is a time-zone representation and is particularly useful for deliberations concerning the control of multi-input and multi-output dynamic systems
 iske alaava yah araikhik tantron or kaal-parivarti tantron ke vishleshan tathaa sanshleshan ke liye bhi upyogi he
 In this method of system representation, the state variables, inputs and outputs of the system are represented by first-order differential equations
 avasthaa kshetra model main do sameekaran hote hai - avasthaa sameekaran tathaa output sameekaran
 Compared to the frequency-field representation, the state-scale representation has the following advantages: 'avasthaa kshetra' yaa state-spes ek kaalpanik kshetra he jiske aksh avasthaa-char hai
 The state variables of the system in this space can be viewed as a vector
 kisi p input, q output tathaa n avasthaa-charon se yukt tantra ko is paddati main nimnlikhit prakaar se nirupit kiya jaataa he: Where called state vector, and is called output vector, u is called input vector, a is the parent of states, b is the input matrix, c is the output matrix and d All the matrices in the above representation can be variable with time, but if the system is linear and unchanging over time, then these matrices will be unchanging
 char samay t { \ displaystyle t} satat ho saktaa he yaa vivikt 
 In this case, the variable k { \ displaystyle k} is often used instead of time t { \ displaystyle t}
 jin tantron main satat parivarti tathaa vivikt rup se parivartit hone vaale avyav hote hai unako sankar tantra kehete hai
 Therefore, in different situations the form of the state-space model will be of the following type: kisi tantra ke avasthaa char uske puraane avasthaaon evam inputon se nirdhaarit hote hai
 In fact, if the old state x and input u are known over time, then the value of x can be calculated: us tantra ko niyantraneey kehete hai jisko, sweekaarya inputon ke madhyam se, kisi ek avasthaa se duusari avasthaa main simit samay main le jaaya ja saktaa he
 a continuous, time-invariant, linear state-model will be controllable if and only if- jahaan 'rank' kaa arth kisi matrix kii raikhik rup se swatantra panktiyon kii sankhya he
 That system is called 'observable' whose internal states can be calculated after knowledge of the outputs
 koi satat, kaal-aparivarti, raikhik avasthaa-model prekshniya hoga, yadi or keval yadi- The summary of the above discussion is that the meaning of control is that the input required to move that system from one state to another in a limited time is possible
 prekshaniyata kaa arth yah he ki yadi kisi tantra ke output gyaat hone par aanatarik avasthaaen nikaali ja saktin hai

 " The philosopher of Delphi, Pythia, only made predictions on the seventh day of each month, the seven most closely related to Apollo during the nine warmer months of the year; Thus, for the ancient Greeks, Delphi was not a major source of devotional speech
 kai dhani vyaktiyon ne daivagya ko khush karne ke liye atirikt pashu bali dekar salaah kaa prayaas karne vaale logon ke samoohon kii upeksha kii taaki unki prarthanaayen bekaar na chali jaaen

 During the classical period of Greece, the temple was changed to become a place of worship for Apollo, and priests were included in the temple organization - though there was no change in tradition regarding prophecy - and apparently always the priestesses especially the services of the divine Continued to provide

 balak ne vinamratapurvak kaha- maan! mujhase agyaanavash aisa ho gaya he
 i did not do this due to any malice or malice

 After reaching there, Parvati ji asked Shiva - God! What is the remedy that you have taken as a result of which i have come to you
 shivaji ne 'ganesh vrath' kaa itihaas unase kah diya
 Then Parvati ji worshiped Ganeshji in 21-21 days for 21 days with the desire of meeting his son Kartikeya with Durva, flowers and laddus

 When Lord Shiva came after taking bath in Bhogavati, Ganeshji stopped him at the gate
 ise shivaji ne apana apmaan samajha or krodhit hokar unka sir dhad se alag karke bheetar chale gaye
 Parvati, seeing him angry, understood that Mahadevji was angry due to the delay in food
 isliye unhone tatkaal do thaaliyon main bhojan paroskar shivaji ko bulaayaa
 Seeing the second platter, Shiva ji was astonished and asked- For whom is this second platter? Parvati ji spoke for son Ganesh, who is guarding the gate outside
 yah sunakar shivaji or adhik aashcharyachakit hue
 Your son is watching? Yes Nath! Didn't you see it i saw it, but when i stopped myself, i considered him to be a defiant boy and cut off his head

 But the sympathy and active support of the erstwhile scholar and public society started meeting the assembly itself, so soon after its establishment, the assembly started taking up very concrete and important work
 apni sthapana ke anantar hi sabha ne bade thos or mahatvapurn kaary haath main lenaa armbh kar diya
 Following is a brief description of the work that the Sabha has done in the last years of its life: sabha kii sthapana ke samay tak uttar pradesh ke nyaayalayon main angreji or urdu hi vihit thi
 With the effort of the gathering, in which the self
 Mahamana Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya had a special addition, since 1900, the use of Nagari was ordered in Uttar Pradesh and it was made compulsory for government employees to know both Hindi and Urdu languages
 sabha kaa yah pustkaalay desh main hindi kaa sabase bada pustkaalay he
 Self Thakur Gadadhar Singh provided his library to the assembly and from that it was established in the assembly in 1896 AD

 As soon as the assembly was established, the goal was that the handwriting of ancient scholars in the cities and countryside is being tied up in the seats of the people
 atah san 1900 se sabha ne anveshakon ko gaanv-gaanv or nagar-nagar main ghar-ghar bhejkar is baat kaa pataa lagaana aarambh kiya ki kinake yahan koun-koun se granth uplabdh hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, this work is still being done very widely and widely
 iske atirikt punjab, dilli, rajasthan or madhyapradesh main bhi yah kaary hua he
 The meeting also publishes a quarterly report of this discovery
 san 1955 tak kii khoj kaa sankshipt vivaran bhi do bhaagon main sabha ne prakashit kiya he
 As a result of this scheme, a systematic history of Hindi literature has been prepared and many unknown works of unknown authors and known authors have come to light

 With concentrated acids it forms salts which undergo hydrolysis
 ammonia tathaa cynojan chloride yaa bromide kii abhikriya se cinamide kii prapti saralata se hoti he: Thyoyuria is also prepared by mercuric oxide
 cinamide ko vyavsaayik maatra main taiyaar karne ke liye calcium cinamide ko jal ke saath bhalee bhanti hilaakar tathaa salphurik amla dwaara udasin banaakar chaan lete hai; phir is chane hue vilyan kaa nirvaat main vashpikaran karte hai
 Aqueous solution of cyanamide in the presence of alkaline compounds forms a second dicynamide, NC, C, NH, NH2) by polymerization
 dycinamide yaa cinamide ko niskriy vayumandal main 120 degree -125 degree celsius tak garam karne se tritay, melamine, H2NC=N,C =N,C =N miltaa he; ammonia ke saath garam karne se isaki prapti adhik hoti he tathaa yah adhik shuddh bhi hota he
 Forms thiourea with hydrogen sulfide and guanidine with ammonia
 cinamide kaa hydrogen parmaanu dhaatu se visthapit hota he
 In an aqueous or alcoholic solution, one atom of alkaline metal hydroxide or calcium hydroxide cyanamide displaces: hydrogen kaa doosraa parmaanu kshareey dhaatu yaa calcium se sidhe visthapit nahin hota: sodium cynide ko kasnar vidhi se taiyaar karne main dysodium cinamide ek madhyamik yogic ke rup main miltaa he
 Calcium cyanamide is obtained by heating calcium carbide with nitrogen to about 1000 ° C; Carbides of other metals also make cyanamide in it by heating with nitrogen at high temperatures
 kuch dhaatuon ke cynide garam karne se tatsambandhi cinamide tathaa carbon main vighatit hote hai
 This type of dissolution in calcium, magnesium, lead and iron cyanide occurs only by heating
 kintu zinc, cadmium, cobalt, nikal tathaa lithium ke cynide main taap ke atirikt utprerak kii bhi aavashyaktaa padati he
 Calcium cyanamide is prepared by the reaction of large amounts of calcium carbide and nitrogen
 adolf frank tathaa nicodem kairo ne san 1895 ke lagbhag gyaat kiya ki vyavsaayik calcium carbide 800 sein
 se adhiktaap par nitrogen ke saath badi sugamawa se abhikriya karata he: By heating calcium carbide to the desired temperature, nitrogen flows over it; Nitrogen reacts with calcium carbide; In this reaction more heat is produced, which causes more heat of calcium carbide
 at: nitrogen tab tak kriya karata rahata he jab tak sabakaa sab calcium carbide samaapt nahin ho jaataa
 It was found by experiments that increasing temperature increases the speed of this action
 kintu 1200 degree celsius se adhik taap par calcium cinamide kaa vighatan hone lagata he
 Therefore, the appropriate temperature for this action is 1100 ° –1130 ° C
 calcium chloride yaa calcium chloride tathaa calcium fluoride kaa mishran is kriya ke liye utprerak hai; nitrogen kam-se-kam 99
7% shuddh hona chahie tathaa calcium carbide kaa churna niskriy vayumandal main bananaa chahie
 The method of preparing calcium cyanamide in commercial quantities is called discontinuous method
 aajkal is vidhi main 4 se 10 ton kii dharitavali bhatthiyaan upyog main laai jaati hai
 The furnaces are of cast iron, their inner part is free from fire effects from inaccessible soil and temperate bricks
 ek vrihad kaagaj belan bhatthi kii khoh main calcium carbide ke liye rakhaa rahata he
 a small amount of fluorspar is mixed with calcium carbide
 florespar utprerak tathaa abhikriya ko niyantrit karne kaa kaary karata he
 The mouth of the furnace is covered with a heat-blocking lid
 garam karne kaa vidyut kaa ek 'electrode' dhakkan ke dwaara madhya chhidr dwaara calcium carbide tak rahata he tathaa doosraa bhatthi ke tal main
 Nitrogen flows through the furnace floor and side holes
 rasinic kriya kaa prarambh bhatthi ke bhitari bhaag ko 1000 degree -1100 degree celsius tak garam karke karte hai, tatpashchaat jab tak sabakaa sab calcium carbide nitrogen se kriya nahin kar letaa
 This action continues on its own
 inamen lagbhag 24 se 40 ghante kaa samay lagata he
 When the action is over, calcium is removed from the furnace and stored in an inert atmosphere
 calcium cinamide ko vyavsaayik maatra main taiyaar karne kii duusari vidhi ko santat vidhi kehete hai
 In this method, calcium carbide is mixed with 10 percent calcium chloride and filled into porous iron pots, then poured into a tunnel filled with nitrogen gas
 surang kaa ek bhaag baahar se garam kiya jaataa he; yaheen par kriya hoti he
 This allows for controlled air cooling in the next part, it maintains the appropriate temperature for action
 surang kaa antim bhaag sheet kaksh kaa kaary karata he
 The calcium cyanamide obtained from the above methods is dark brown powder
 iskaa yah rang carbon ke kaaran hota he
 Flowing hydrocyanide vapor over calcium carbonate heated in a ceramic tube at 750 ° to 850 ° c for 2 hours gives 99% pure calcium cyanamide; The addition of 10 parts ammonia and 2 parts carbon monoxide by volume over hot calcium carbonate gives 92% pure calcium cyanamide
 110 degree -115 degree celsius or 6 vayumandal dabaav par calcium sinamide jalawaashp dwaara ammonia or calcium carbonate main vighatit hota he- Calcium cyanamide is commonly used as a good fertilizer
 inkaa nitrogen mitti main ammonia banaata he or is rup main yah nikshalay ke liye avarohak kaa kaary karata he
 It provides soluble calcium which is beneficial for plants and keeps the acidity of the soil right
 mitti kii nami se iskaa jal-apghaton hota he
 This produces cyanamide which is harmful to plants but it soon turns into ammonia
 beej yaa paudhon ko isse haani na ho, at: isko beej bone ke pehle mitti main kaaphi neeche rakhte hai jisamen ankur ke jad ke sparsh main aane ke pehle hi isaki sab rasinic kriyaayein purna ho jaati hai
 To destroy weeds etc
, sprinkle calcium cyanamide powder
 isamen kam laagat lagati he
 It also has special significance in the industry as a raw material
 isse calcium cynide paryaapt maatra main taiyaar kii jaati he
 Di-cyanodiamide, melamine and guanidine compounds are also prepared from it
 melamine se melamine plastic taiyaar kiya jaataa he jo kai arthon main duusare plasticon se acha hota he

 Tandon's entry into politics was due to his love for Hindi
 17 farvari 1951 ko mujffarnagar 'suhrid sangh` ke 17 wein varshikotsav ke avasar par unhone apane bhaashan main is baat ko sweekaar bhi kiya tha
 Purushottam Das Tandon was born on 1 August 1882 in Allahabad city, Uttar Pradesh

 While continuing his studies, he obtained a master's degree in history in 1907 and became a junior in the Allahabad High Court to the then renowned lawyer Tej Bahadur Sapru
 purushottam das tandon atyant medhaavi or bahumukhi pratibha ke dhani the
 His field of work is mainly divided into three parts - freedom struggle, literature and society
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main tandon ji ne ek yoddha kii bhoomika kaa nirvaah kiya
 He was a member of the Congress party since 1899 in his student life
 1906 main ve elahabaad se bhartiya rashtriya congress ke pratinidhi chune gayi
 He was also associated with the Congress Party committee studying the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919
 1920 main asahyog aandolan prarambh hua
 On Gandhiji's call, he quit his flourishing profession of advocacy and jumped into this struggle
 san 1930 main savinay avagya aandolan ke silsile main basti main giraftaar hue or karawas kaa dand mila
 Jawaharlal Nehru along with Purshottam Das Tandon were among the freedom fighters arrested before Gandhiji returned from the Round Table Conference held in London in 1931
 1934 main unhone bihar kii pradeshik kisaan sabha ke adhyaksh pad ko sushobhit kiya or bihar kisaan andolan ke saath sahanubhuti rakhte hue unke vikaas ke anek kaary kiye
 He served as the spokesperson of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from 31 July 1937 to 10 August 1950
 san 1937 main dhara sabhaaon ke chunaav hue
 In these elections, Congress got a majority in seven of the eleven provinces
 uttar pradesh main bhi congress ko baari safalataa mili or iskaa puraa shrey tandon ji ko tha
 Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri writes - In 1936-37 elections were held for the new provincial stream meetings, in which the Congress participated with full power
 uttar pradesh main bhi congress ko baari safalataa mili or iskaa puraa shrey tandon ji ko jaataa he
 He toured all over the state, he himself stood for the Legislative Assembly from Prayag Nagar and won unopposed
 yah unke anuroop hi tha
 After some time when the cabinet was formed, he was elected unanimously president of Dhara Sabha
 tandon ji lagaataar desh ke swatantraaa sangram main rat rahe
 In this order, he was placed under house arrest in 1940 and remained in jail for a year
 agast 1942 ko elahabaad main phir giraftaar hue or 1944 main jail se mukt hue
 This was his last and seventh jail visit
 unke sangharsh or tyaag ko lakshith karte hue kishoridas vaajapeyi ji ne likhaa he- "jab jab rashtriya sangharsh hue, tandon ji sabase aage rahe
 You don't know how to sit empty
 " 1942 main jab ve jail se chute to unhen dikhalaai padaa ki bhartiya samaaj main niraashaa chhaayi hui he, sabhi hataash pade hue hai
 Therefore, he re-established the new consciousness by establishing an organization called 'congress Representative Assembly' and when the provincial committees were formed, the 'representative Assembly' was dissolved
 tandon ji elahabaad nagarpalika ke adhyaksh rahe or anek saahsee tathaa aitihaasik kaary kiye
 He was also elected to the Constituent Assembly of India in 1946

 According to some thinkers, achieving independence was their first goal
 hindi ko ve saadhan maanate the- "yadi hindi bhartiya swatantraaa ke aade aayegi to main swayan uskaa galaa ghont doongaa
 He continued to consider Hindi as the means to achieve independence before the independence of the country and to maintain independence after independence
 " yahan yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki tandon ji kaa raajnneeti main pravesh hindi prem ke kaaran hi hua
 Tandon ji worked as a lecturer in Hindi at Victoria College, Gwalior, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a student of Victoria College at that time
 17 farvari 1951 ko mujffarnagar 'suhrid sangh' ke 17 wein varshikotsav ke avasar par tandon ji ne kaha tha- "hindi ke paksh ko sabal karne ke uddeshy se hi maine congress jaisi sanstha main pravesh kiya, kyonki mere hriday par hindi kaa hi prabhaav sabase adhik tha or maine use hi apane jivan kaa sabase mahaan vrath banaaya
 xxrep 6 
 My love for Hindi literature forced me to join politics to protect her interests and to clarify the path of her development
 " at: yah kaha ja saktaa he ki tandon ji ke saadhy swatantraaa or hindi donon hi the
 Rajarshi had an affection for Hindi since childhood
 is prem ko baalkrishna bhatta or madan mohan malviya ji ne praudhata pradaan karne kii
 On October 10, 1910, the first session of Hindi Sahitya Sammelan was held in Kashi under the chairmanship of Mahamana Malaviya ji and Tandon Ji was appointed the minister of the conference
 tadnantar hindi sahitya sammelan ke madhyam se hindi kii atyadhik seva kii
 Tandon ji established Hindi Vidyapeeth Prayag to spread Hindi
 is peeth kii sthapana kaa uddeshy hindi shiksha kaa prasar or angreji ke varchasv ko samaapt karnaa tha
 The conference held several Hindi examinations
 in parikshaon se dakshin main bhi hindi kaa prachaar prasar hua
 This work of the conference also had an impact in colleges and universities, Hindi courses were recognized in many colleges and universities
 ve jaanate the ki sampoorn bharat main hindi ke prasar ke liye ahindi bhashiyon kaa sahyog apekshit he
 Perhaps the result of his thinking was Gandhi's participation in the conference
 aage chalakar 'hindustani' ke prashn par tandon ji or mahatma gandhi main matbhed hua
 Tandon ji was an unbeatable warrior
 ve satya or nyaay ke liye kisi se bhi loha le sakate the
 On his principles, he remained immobile and stable like a rock
 parinamat: gandhi ji ko apane ko sammelan se alag karnaa padaa, tandon ji niraapad apane maarg par badhate rahe
 In 1949, when the question of official language was raised in the Constituent Assembly, there was a strange situation at that time
 mahatma gandhi to hindustani ke samarthak the hi, pan0 nehru or dow rajendra prasad tathaa anya anek netaa bhi hindustani ke pakshdhar the, par tandon ji haare nahin, jhuke nahin
 As a result, he also won
 11, 12, 13, 14 disambar 1949 ko garmagaram bahes ke baad hindi or hindustani ko lekar congress main matdaan hua, hindi ko 62 or hindustani ko 32 mat mili
 Eventually, Hindi was declared as the national language and Devanagari royalty
 hindi ko rashtrabhasha or 'vandemaataram' ko raashtragit sweekrut karaane ke liye tandon ji ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath ek or abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 He had also collected signatures and letters of support from crores of people
 yahan yah ullekh kar dena bhi apekshit he ki tandon ji ne nagari ankon ko samvidhan main manyata dilaane ke liye bharsak koshish kii is hetu unhone us sanstha ko choda jisaki seva lagbhag paanch dashak tak kii
 In the Constituent Assembly, Rajarshi opposed the English numerals, but due to the instruction of Nehru ji, Congress Member Shri Kanhaiyalal Maniklal Munshi was in favor of the formula of Shri Gopal Swami Iyengar
 tandon ji kaa virodh prastaav gir gaya or nagari ank samvidhan main manyata praapt na kar sake
 In order to get Hindi the national language and 'vande Mataram' the national anthem, Tandon ji launched another campaign with his colleagues
 unhone karodon logon ke hastakshar or samarthan patr bhi ekatra kiye the
 While assessing the personality and work of Rajarshi, often his literary form is ignored
 vah ek ucchkoti ke rachanaakaar the
 The earliest history can be discovered in his works
 sahityakar ke rup main tandon ji nibandhkaar, kavi or patrkaar ke rup main dikhalaai padate hai
 His essays are related to Hindi language and literature, religion and culture and other diverse fields
 kavy rachanaaon main 'bandar sabha mahakavy', 'kutir kaa pushp' or 'swatantraaa' apana aitihaasik mahatv rakhti hai
 Nationalism and patriotism predominate in these poems
 unki rachanaaon main kavyashastra kii baariki foondnaa chhidranveshan karnaa hi hoga, kintu yugin yatharth kii abhivyakti tandon ji ne jis dhang se kii he, vah nishchay hi shlaghneey he- The 'bandar Sabha epic' has exposed the policies of the British in the Alha style
 unhone angrejon ke prati jo chutkiyaan lee hai unamem se ek-do kaa anand aap bhi lijie- In the field of journalism, Tandon ji was also a great scholar of English
 shri tribhuvan narayan singh ji ne ullekh kiya he ki san 1950 main jab ve congress ke sabhapati chune gaye to unhone apana abhibhaashan hindi main likhaa or angreji anuwaad maine kiya
 Shri Sampurnanand ji also saw that English translation, but when Tandon ji read that translation, he rewrote many pages in it
 tab mujhe is baat kii anubhuti hui ki jahaan ve hindi ke prakand vidwaan the, vahiin angreji sahitya par bhi unka bada adhikaar tha
 Seeing the multi-dimensional and talented personality of Purushottam Das Tandon, he was conferred with the title of 'rajarshi'
 15 april san 1948 kii sandhyavela main sarayu tat par vaidic mantrocchar ke saath mahant devraha baba ne aapako 'rajarshi` kii oopaadhi se alankrita kiya
 Some people found it unfair, but Sri Shankaracharya Maharaj of Jyotirmath considered it scriptural and confirmed it by the Pandit Sabha of Kashi at the degree distribution ceremony of the All India Cultural Conference of 1948
 tab se yah oopaadhi unke naam ke saath avichhinn rup se judi hui swayan alankrita ho rahi he
 The Rajarshi was a staunch opponent of stereotypes and superstitions even though Indian culture was extremely supportive and supportive
 unhone bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kuprathaon par bhi apane do took vichaar vyakt kiye
 He had a wonderful self-power, so that he could complete the toughest tasks easily
 balvivaah or vidhwaa vivaah ke sambandh main unka maananaa tha ki "vidhwaa vivaah kaa prachaar hamaari sabhyataa, hamaare sahitya or hamaare samaaj sanghathan ke mukhya aadhaar pativrat dharm ke pratikul hai" unhone spasht kiya ki vidhwaa-vivaah kii maang isliye jor pakad rahi he, kyonki hamaare samaaj main bal-vivaah kii shaastra viruddh pranali chal padi he or bal vidhwaaon kaa prashn hi bhartiya samaaj kii mukhya samasya he
 Hence, "stopping the practice of child marriage proves to be more important than widow's marriage
" " One or two examples of this aspect of his personality will suffice - often people think that cooked food is digestible, but Rajarshi considered it a stereotype and did not accept food cooked with fire for years
 chini khaanaa ek baar chhod diya
 On one hand they avoided cow's milk and on the other hand with leather shoes
 is prakaar ve ek adbhut vyaktitv ke dharak the
 In India, the problem of communalism existed in its form before independence
 kuch netaa tandon ji par bhi sampradayik hone kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 It is true that Rajarshi was the ultimate devotee and nurturer of his culture
 ve yah kehane main bhi hichak kaa anubhav nahin karte the ki bharat main do samskritiyon ko jivit rakhana desh ke saath vishwasghaat karnaa hoga, par iskaa matlab yah nahin tha ki tandon ji sampradayik the, muslim virdohi the
 In this regard, how meaningful are the views of Kulakusum- swayan tandon ji ne bhi likhaa he- In fact, Tandon's personality was humanistic
 unke ghar par jo balak unka sahyog karata tha, vah musalmaan tha, par kisi vidmbana he ki log kehete hai ki tandon ji sampradayik the
 There are many other aspects of Rajarshi Tandon's personality; Just like he was the poor, the victim's help, Deenbandhu in the true sense, the idol of compassion and Babuji was a person of moral conduct, it can be inferred from this example- "san 1950 kaa mahakumbh tha
 The daughter-in-law said to go by car to take a bath in the Ganges
 babu ji ne uttar diya ki gaadi 'spikar` kii he
 You can go with me, but not alone
 " After the above brief discussion it can be said that Rajarshi's personality was multi-faceted and consistent with Rajarshi
 ve bahumukhi pratibha ke dhani the
 He was not only an exclusive lover of Hindi, but was also synonymous with Hindi
 hindi sahitya ke itihaas main unka ullekh ek samarth kavi or niabandh lekhak ke rup main hota he
 He is counted among the frontline fighters among the immortals of the Indian freedom struggle and his name is inscribed with golden letters in the history of the Indian freedom struggle
 ve param snehi, udaar or karunaa kii murti hote hue bhi ispati vyaktitv ke dharak the
 Immovable and unalterable like the Himalayas
 param hindi sevi, raashtra-bhakt or bhartiya samskruti ke is upaask ko meraa shat shat naman
 In 1961, he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, the highest state honor of India
