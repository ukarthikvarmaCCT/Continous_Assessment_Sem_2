 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a late night meeting with the ministers that they should do their work, do not pay attention to the opposition's talk

 In a meeting that lasted for about one and a half hours, the Prime Minister asked his cabinet colleagues to take the message about the functioning of the government to the people and accept the challenge of better contact with them
 samay-samay par samiksha karne ko kahavistrut yojana baad main taiyaar kii jaaegi lekin mantriyon se janvari ke duusare saptaah se sansadeey kshetron main daure shuru karne or unke liye nirdhaarit kshetron main kam se kam 30 minute bitaane ko kaha gaya he
 The Prime Minister asked the ministers to periodically review the functioning of their departments and emphasized the need to bring in fresh new ideas to enhance the performance of the work and improve the image of the government
 bhagidaari badhaani chahiemodi kii raay thi ki centre sarkaar kii yojanaon ke liye bajet taiyaar karne main logon kii bhagidaari badhaani chahie or aisa nahin ho ki vittiya varsh khatm hone ke kagaar par aane par dhan kharch karne ko lekar gahamagahami kii sthiti bane
 It was also decided that each minister would visit two parliamentary constituencies and tell people what decisions the government has taken since the government came to power in 2014
 sachai bataane par dhyaan kendrit karesutron ke anusaar pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko yathasambhav saadhaaran bhashaa main janata tak pahunchaaya jaae
 There was a general consensus in the meeting that the winter session is going to end on 23 December and now the time has come for the government to focus on telling the truth about the opposition outside the Parliament
 yah raay in sanketon ke bich ai he ki sarkaar sheetakaaleen satr main jiesti vidheyak paarit nahin kara paaegi jahaan congress neshnal herald maamle or anya vishyon par sansad main kaamkaaj baadhit kar rahi he
 According to sources, the Prime Minister told the ministers that the NDA government has done a lot for the country, so they should remain confident
 pradhanmantri ne mantriyon se garibon ke liye kaam karne or yojanaon ke madhyam se unka khyaal rakhane ko bhi kaha
 Modi is believed to have said, 'the government will have to work for the poor
 ve aapke saath khadey rahenge
 The government should be seen in such a way that it is taking care of the poor

 During the debate on Rafale fighter jet deal in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi did not know the difference between plain aircraft and armed aircraft
 arun jetali ke is bayaan par palatwaar karte hue rahul gandhi ne upie ke 2007 main bharat sarkaar kaa request for prapojal (RFP) jari kiya jiske aadhaar par bhartiya vayusena ke liye france se rafel ladaaku vimaan kaa chayan kiya gaya
 After a ruckus in the Lok Sabha, during a press conference at Congress headquarters, Rahul Gandhi read out the Government of India's Request for Proposal (RFP) issued on August 2007, based on which the deal was struck
 rahul gandhi ne bataaya ki RFP kii shart main sabhi tarah ke hathiyaaron kii baat kii gai he jisamen lager sensor, rocket, radar va anya hathiyaaron kaa puraa byora tha or yahi is saude kaa aadhaar bhi tha
 Explain that before any deal RFP is issued by the government, only after fulfilling the condition of which a company can bid for the deal
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne vitt mantri arun jetali par jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki unhone kaha tha ki mujhe phuli loded aircraft or plane aircraft kaa fark nahin pataa
 Rahul also showed some excerpts from Jaitley's speech and tried to prove that the finance minister himself told the Rafale plane price which was not shared by the government as confidential
 darasal vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar ke dauraan hui nai rafel deal 58000 karod rupee kii he
 Rahul Gandhi said that we were being asked where the value of Rs 1600 crore came from, which is a simple math
 agar 58000 karod rupee ko 36 se bhaag diya jaae to 1600 karod rupee hi aayega
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whether Air Force officials and Defense Ministry officials had expressed any objection when the price of the aircraft was being fixed at Rs 1600 crore? UPA government there were two different prices one of the flyaway aircraft and the offer of the weaponised aircraft
 — Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley)january 2, 2019rahul gandhi ke bayaan kaa jawaab dete hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne twit main likhaa, 'wo kitna jaanate hai? kab samajhenge? ek murkh bhi saadhaaran aircraft or hathiyaaron se las aircraft kii keemton kii tulana nahin karegaa
 Even during the UPA government, the offer also had two different prices for plain aircraft and weaponized aircraft
