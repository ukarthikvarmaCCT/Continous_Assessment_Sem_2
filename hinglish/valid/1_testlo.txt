 surya ke vibhinn roopon kii apeksha keval ek hi rup ko vishisht samajha jane laga
 Its successor was Amenhotep IV, who in 1375 BC
 Ascended the throne, conceived the unique sun called Aton and considered it to be the best, omnipotent, universal and one God
 vishwa ke itihaas main saarvbhaum vishvadev kii kalpana kaa yah pratham or anoothaa udhaaharan he
 Because of his devotion to devotion to 'aton', he hated the traditional sun god Amon Rey and stopped his worship by the edict, but once again, Amon Re's worship became popular
 misr main nil nadi tathaa uski dhaaraon main devatv kaa aarope kiya gaya or puja hone lagi thi
 At the same time many other small forms were conceived

 The literature of each language of India has its own independent and sharp features stamped with the personality of its region
 punjabi or sindhi, idhar hindi or urdu kii pradesh-seemayen kitni mili hui hai ! kintu unke apane-apane sahitya kaa vaishishty kitna prakhar he ! isi prakaar gujarati or marathi kaa jan-jivan paraspar otprot he, kintu kya unke bich main kisi prakaar kii bhranti sambhav he ! dakshin kii bhashaaon kaa udgam ek he : sabhi dravid parivaar kii vibhutiyaan hai, parantu kya kannada or malayalam yaa tamil or telegu ke swaroopya ke vishay main shankaa ho sakati he ! yahi baat banglaa, asamiya or oriya ke vishay main satya he
 Assamese and Oriya are maintaining their independent existence by digesting the deep influence of Bengal

 Sangam literature of Tamil, bi-meaning poetry and examples of Telugu and Awadhan literature, Malayalam messages and kir-song and Manipravalam style, Marathi pavads, Gujarati narratives and fagu, Bengali Bengali Mangal poetry, Assamese badgeet And Buranji literature, Punjabi's Ramayakhyana and Veeragati, Urdu's Ghazal and Hindi recitation and Chhayavad etc
 are bright proofs of the peculiarity of their respective language literature
 phir bhi kadachit yah parthaky aatma kaa nahin he
 Just as the unity of Indian culture is irrespective of many religions, streams of thought and systems of life, similarly, for the same reason, research of the basic unity of Indian literature is also possible in spite of many languages and conventions
 bhartiya sahitya kaa prachurya or vaividhya to apurv he hi, uski yah moulikta ekta or bhi romantic he
 Except for Tamil and Urdu in the south, almost all Indian languages have the same birth-age
 telugu-sahitya ke pracheenatam gyaat kavi hai nannay, jinka samay he isa kii gyarahavin sati

 The Adi Granth of Gujarati is the 'bahu-baliras' of Shalibhadra Bharateshwar, composed in 1185 AD, and the primitive literature of Marathi originated in the twelfth century
 yahi baat purv kii bhashaaon main satya he
 Bangla's chariot songs may have been composed sometime between the tenth and twelfth centuries; The oldest examples of Assamese-literature are often from the end of the thirteenth century, the best being the works of Hem Saraswati, 'prahladcharitra' and 'harigourism'

 There are only two languages that have a different birth date — Tamil, which is as ancient as Sanskrit and Urdu, whose actual beginning cannot be considered before the fifteenth century
 haalaanki kuch vidwaan urdu kaa bhi udbhav 13-14 veen shatee ke baba farid, abdulla hamid nagori tathaa amir khusro kii rachanaaon se maanane lage hai
 Apart from birth, the stages of development of modern Indian literature are also often the same
 praayah sabhi kaa adikaal pandrahavin shatee tak chalata he
 The end of the pre-medieval period ends with the end of the Mughal period, that is, in the middle of the century and in the middle of the seventeenth century, and with the establishment of the English power in the middle of the north, and from then on the modern era begins
 is prakaar bhartiya bhashaaon ke adhikansh saahitiyon kaa vikaas-kram lagbhag ek-sa hi he; sabhi praayah samakaleen chaar charnon main vibhakt hai
 The basis of this parallel development sequence is very clear and that is the development sequence of India's political and cultural life
 bich-bich main vyavdhaan hone par bhi bharatvarsh main shatabdiyon tak samaan raajnneetik vyavastha rahi he
 During the Mughal rule, there remained close contact between north-south and east-west for about one and a half years
 mughalon kii satta khandit ho jane ke baad bhi yah sampark tutaa nahin
 Even before Mughal rule, there were efforts to expand the state
 rajputon main koi ek chhatra bharat-samraat to nahin hua, kintu unke rajvansh bharatvarsh ke anek bhaagon main shashan kar rahe the
 Even though the governance was different, their feudal system of governance was often the same
 isi prakaar musalamaanon kii shashan pranali main bhi spasht moolbhoot samanta thi
 Later, the British strengthened this unity even further by establishing central governance
 inhen sab kaarnon se bharat ke vibhinn bhashaa-bhashi pradeshon kii raajnneetik paristhitiyon main paryaapt samya rahaa he
 Cultural conditions have been more common than political situations
 pichley sahatrabd main anek dharmik or saanskrithik andolan aise hue jinka prabhaav bharatvyaapee tha
 In the era of the decline of Buddhism, the Nath sect rose up due to the combination of its many branches and shaiva-shakta religions that began in the early second millennium of Christ to Tibet etc
 in the north, territories of the Eastern Ghats in the south, Maharashtra in the west The sarvatra was often spread in the beginning and in the east
 yoga kii pradhanta hone par bhi in saadhuon kii sadhana main, jinamein nath, siddh or shaiva sabhi the, jivan ke vichaar or bhav-paksh kii upeksha nahin thi or inamen se anek sadhu atmabhivyakti evam siddhant-pratipaadan donon ke liye kavi-karm main pravrutt hote the
 The influence of these communities was often present in the first phase of the development of Indian languages
 inke baad inke uttaradhikari sant-sampradaayon or navaagat musalamaanon ke sufi-sant kaa prasar desh ke bhinn-bhinn bhaagon main hone laga
 The saint-sect was influenced by Vedanta philosophy and practiced and preached nirgun bhakti
 sufi dharm main bhi niraakaar brahm kii hi upasna thi, kintu uskaa madhyam tha utkar premanubhuti
 Although Sufi-saints dominated more in the north-west, they also had many centers in the Bijapur and Golconda states of the south and there were many famous Sufi saints
 inke pashchaat vaishnav andolan kaa aarambh hua jo samast desh main bade veg se vyaapt ho gaya
 Many sweet ways of devotion to Rama and Krishna were spread all over the country and the whole of India year passed through the songs of God
 udhar muslim samskruti or sabhyataa kaa prabhaav bhi nirantar bad rahaa tha
 Many fascinating elements of Iranian culture - such as splendor - luxury, ornamentation, etc
 - were getting mixed up in Indian life very fast and a new court or civil culture was emerging
 raajnneetik or aarthik prabhaav ke kaaran yah samskruti sheeghra hi apana prasadmay prabhaav kho baithi or jivan ke utkarsh evam aanandamay paksh ke sthaan par rugn vilasita he isamen rah gayi
 Then came the merchants of the west who brought western culture with them and behind which groups of Christian preachers began to enter India
 unnisvin shatee main angreji ko prabhutv saare desh main sthapit ho gaya or shaasha varg sakriy rup se yojana banaakar apni shiksha, samskruti or unke madhyam se pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main apane dharm kaa prasar karne laga
 This contact and struggle of oriental and westernized modern India was born
 bharat kii bhashaaon kaa parivaar yadhyapi ek nahin he, phir bhi unka saahitiyik aadharbhumi ek hi he
 The aristocratic literature of Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana, Bhagavata, Sanskrit - namely the immortal works of Kalidas, Bhavabhuti, Bana, Sriharsha, Amaruk and Jayadeva, etc
, literature of Buddhist, Jain and other religions written in Pali, Prakrit and Apabhramsa to all languages of India
 Found in succession
 shaastra ke antargat upanishad, shaddarshan, smritiyaan aadi or udhar kavyashastra ke anek amar granth—naatyashaastra, dhvanyalok, kavyprakash, sahityadarpan rasgandhar aadi kii vichaar-vibhuti kaa upyog bhi sabhi ne nirantar kiya he
 In fact, these are the renewable sources of modern Indian languages, which have been influencing everyone equally
 inkaa prabhaav nishchay hi atyant samanvayakaari rahaa he or inase prerit sahitya main ek prakaar kii moolbhoot samanta swatah hi aa gai he
 Thus, innate equality is a natural phenomenon in the flourishing Indian literature based on the same political, cultural and literary grounds
 sabase purana jivit sahitya rugveda he jo sanskrit bhashaa main likhaa gaya he
 Today we have reached the modern era of Indian literature, passing through many languages like Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit and Apabhransh etc
 bharat main 30 se bhi zyada mukhya bhashaayen hai or 100 se bhi adhik kshetreey bhashaayen he
 Literature has flourished in almost every language
 bhartiya bhashaaon ke sahitya main likhit or maukhik dono hi mahatvapurn hai
 Hindu religious texts played an important role in ancient Indian literature
 vedon ke saath-saath ramayana or mahabharat jaise mahagranth pracheen bharat main rache gaye
 Vastu Shastra, Kautilya Arthashastra, Panchatantra, Hitopadesh etc
 are prominent in other ancient texts
 sainya abhiyantriki sainya vigyaan ke antargat aane vaale sainik kaaryon ke dizin, nirmaan or rakrakhaav ko kehete hai
 It includes aggressive, protective and logistic structures - all in addition to other functions
 kintu adhikanshtah isamen kilebandi or bhoomikaarya, pulon kaa nirmaan or vidhwans, barudi surangen bichaana or unhen nasht karnaa aadi aata he
 Apabhransh, the most vibrant and prominent language of colloquial and literary composition in North India before the rise of modern languages
 bhashavaigyanik drushti se apbhransh bhartiya aryabhasha ke madhyakaal kii antim avasthaa he jo praakrit or aadhunik bhashaaon ke bich kii sthiti he
 Poets of Apabhramsa have called their language simply 'bhasa', 'desi Bhasa' or 'gamell Bhasa', but in Sanskrit grammar and ornamental texts, the language 'apabhransh' and 'abhistra' is often used for that language
 has gone
 is prakaar apbhransh naam sanskrit ke aacharyon kaa diya hua he, jo apatatah tiraskarasuchak prathit hota he
 The manner in which the great genius Patanjali has used the word 'apabhransha' suggests that the most popular forms of Sanskrit or sage words were called apabhransh or abbrash
 is prakaar pratimaan se chyut, skhlit, bhrasht athwa vikrut shabdon ko apbhransh kii sangya di gai or aage chalakar yah sangya puri bhashaa ke liye sweekrut ho gai
 Dandi's statement confirms this fact
 unhone spasht likhaa he ki shaastra arthath vyakaran shaastra main sanskrit se itar shabdon ko apbhransh kaha jaataa he; is prakaar pali-praakrit-apbhransh sabhi ke shabd 'apbhransh' sangya ke antargat aa jate hai, phir bhi pali praakrit ko 'apbhransh' naam nahin diya gaya
 Scholars like Patanjali have used the names Prakrit and Apabhramsa in the same sense
 parantu bharatmuni kaa naatyashaastra pratham aisi rachana he jisamen apbhransh kaa vaastavik sandarbh miltaa he 
 There the dialect of Aabhiras, in which -u is used in abundance, is called apabhramsa
 dandi ne is baat ko spasht karte hue aage kaha he ki kavy main aabhir aadi boliyon ko apbhransh naam se samaran kiya jaataa he; isse yah nishkarsh nikaala ja saktaa he ki apbhransh naam usee bhashaa ke liye rudh hua jiske shabd samskrutetar the or saath hi jiskaa vyakaran bhi mukhyatah abhiradi lok boliyon par aadhaarit tha
 In this period Apabhransh was particularly different from pali-prakrit etc
 apbhransh ke sambandh main pracheen alankargranthon main do prakaar ke paraspar virdohi mat milte hai
 One orkavayalankar commentator calls Namisadhu Apabhramsa as Prakrit, on the other hand, Bhamah, Dandi, etc
 Acharya refers to Apabhramsa as an independent poetic language different from Prakrit
 in virdohi maton kaa samaadhaan karte hue yaakogi ne kaha he ki shabdasmooh kii drushti se apbhransh praakrit ke nikat he or vyakaran kii drushti se praakrit se bhinn bhashaa he
 Thus, most, even ninety percent, of Apabhramsa's dictionary is derived from Prakrit and the grammatical formation is more developed than natural forms and closer to modern languages
 pracheen vyakaranon ke apbhransh sambandhi vichaaron ke krambaddh adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki chah sau varshon main apbhransh kaa kramshah vikaas hua
 Bharata has described it as the language of Shabar, Aabhira, Gurjar etc
 chand ne 'prakritlakshanam' main ise vibhaasha kaha he or usee ke aasapaas balbhi ke raaj dhruvasen dwitiya ne ek tamrapatt main apane pita kaa gungan karte hue unhen sanskrit or praakrit ke saath hi apbhransh prabandhrachana main nipun bataaya he
 Confirmation of Apabhransh being the poetical language was further confirmed in the seventh century by the masters like Bhamah and Dandi
 kavyamimasaakaar rajasekhar ne apbhransh kaviyon ko rajsabha main sammanpurn sthaan dekar apbhransh ke rajasamman kii ore sanket kiya to tikaakar purushottam ne ise shishtvarg kii bhashaa batalaaya
 At the same time, Acharya Hemchandra, by writing a detailed and illustrative grammar of Apabhramsa, established the glorious position of the Apabhramsa language
 is prakaar jo bhashaa teesri shatee main aabhir aadi jatiyon kii lokboli thi vah chhathi shatee se saahitiyik bhashaa ban gai or 11veen shatee tak jate-jate shishtvarg kii bhashaa tathaa rajbhasha ho gai
 Geographical expansionary references to apabhramsa are also found in ancient texts
 bharat ke samay tak yah pashchimottar bharat kii boli thi, parantu rajasekhar ke samay tak punjab, rajasthan or gujarat arthath samooche pashchimi bharat kii bhashaa ho gai
 At the same time, it is attested by the apostolic works of Swayambhu, Pushpadanta, Dhanapala, Kanakamar, Sirhapa, Kanhapa etc
 that at that time it had become the literary language of the whole of North India
 vaiyakarnon ne apbhransh ke bhedon kii bhi charchaa kii he
 According to Markandeya, its citizens, Upanagar and Brachad had three distinctions and according to Namisadhu, Upanagar, Aabhira and Rustic
 in naamon se kisi prakaar ke kshetreey bhed kaa pataa nahin chalata
 Scholars have called Aabhiras as Vratya, thus 'brachad' can be considered to be related to 'vratya'
 aisi sthiti main aabhiri or brachad ek hi boli ke do naam hue
 Kramadishwar has established the connection of Nagar Apabhransh and Sasak verses
 shasak chhandon kii rachana praayah pashchimi pradeshon main hi hui he
 In this way, all the discrimination of Apabhramsa appears to be associated with Western India
 vastutah saahitiyik apbhransh apane parinishthit rup main pashchimi bharat kii hi bhashaa thi, parantu anya pradeshon main prasar ke saath-saath usamen swabhaavatah kshetreey visheshtaayen bhi jud gayi
 On the basis of the compositions obtained, scholars have estimated the prevalence of two other regional deflation of eastern and southern
 apbhransh bhashaa kaa dhaanchaa lagbhag vahi he jiskaa vivaran hemchandra ke siddhahemshabadanushasanam ke aathven adhyay ke chaturth paad main miltaa he
 The nature of Sanskrit words used by Praviparvana in Prakrit, is also mostly visible in the Apabhramsa dictionary, such as the infinite and unused k, c, ch, j, t, d, p, y and v
 And the use of the vowel a or ya shruti quoted in their place
 isi prakaar praakrit kii tarah aadi sanyukt vyanjanon ke sthaan par apbhransh main bhi 'kt', 'kk', 'dd' aadi dwittavyanjan hote the
 But in apabhramsa there was an increasing tendency to conserve a consonant by mixing the corresponding quotient vowels respectively and simplifying the diploid
 isi prakaar apbhransh main praakrit se kuch or vishisht dhvaniparivartan hue
 In apabhramsa causation, the divisions are more worn out than Prakrit, such as 'an' instead of 'an' in the Tritiya singular and 'ha' in place of 'sous' in the Shashthi singular
 iske atirikt apbhransh nirvibhaktik sangya roopon se bhi karkrchana kii gai
 Paragraphs like Sahun, Kehin, Tehin, Desi, Taneen, Kera, Majjhi etc
 were also used
 kridantaj kriyaaon ke prayog kii pravriti badi or sanyukt kriyaaon ke nirmaan kaa aarambh hua
 In short, Apabhramsa created new subantas and tantras
 apbhransh sahitya kii praapt rachanaaon kaa adhikansh jain kavy he arthath rachanaakaar jain the or prabandh tathaa muktak sabhi kaavyon kii vastu jain darshan tathaa puraanon se prerit he
 The oldest and best poet is Swayambhu, who has written 'poum-chariu' and 'mahabharata' about the story of Rama
 duusare mahakavi pushpadanth hai jinhone jain parampara ke trishashthi shalakapurushon kaa charit 'mahapurana' naamak vishaal kavy main chitrit kiya he
 It also includes the story of Rama and Krishna
 iske atirikt pushpadanth ne 'nayakumarchariu' or 'jasharchariu' jaise chote-chote do charitakaavyon kii bhi rachana kii he
 The third popular poet is Dhanapala, whose 'bhavishyatta Kaha' is a popular folklore told on the occasion of Shrutpanchami
 kankaamar muni kaa 'karkanduchariu' bhi ullekhneey charitkavy he
 Apabhramsa has its own cherished verses Doha
 jis prakaar praakrit ko 'gaatha' ke kaaran 'gahabandh' kaha jaataa he, usee prakaar apbhransh ko 'dohabandh'
 There are many fine apabhramsa compositions in the footcal couplet, which are Indu's 'paramataprakash' and 'yogasar', Ramsingh's 'pahud Doha', Devasen's 'savayadhamma Doha' and most of the enlightening works of Jain sages are mostly in Doha
 prabandhchintamani tathaa hemchandrarchit vyakaran ke apbhransh dohon se pataa chalata he ki shringaar or shaury ke aihik muktak bhi kaaphi sankhya main likhe gaye hai
 Some rasak poems have also been written, some of which are extremely religious like 'sermon rasayas raas', but like the sangrasarasak of the unseen, the sarjar romance poetry of Shringar has also been written
 jainon ke atirikt buddha sidhon ne bhi apbhransh main rachana kii he jinamein sarahapa, kanhpa aadi ke dohakosh mahatvapurn hai
 Specimens of apostrophe prose are also found
 gadhy ke tukade udyotan suri kii 'kuvalaymaal kaha' main yatratatra bikhare hue hai
 The material coming out of the new discoveries shows that the literature of Apabhramsa is very rich
 dedh sau ke aasapaas apbhransh granth praapt ho chuke hai jinamein se lagbhag pachaas prakashit hai
 Apabhransh - modern Aryan language and dialect uparokt vivaran se spasht he ki hindi bhashaa kaa udbhav, apbhransh ke shauraseni, ardhamagadhi or magadhi roopon se hua he

 Many akhayans towards Saturn are found in the Puranas
 shanidev ko surya putr evam karmfal daata mana jaataa he
 But at the same time, there are many misconceptions regarding the planet Priti Shatru
 paashchaatya jyotishi bhi use dukh dene vaala maanate hai
 But Saturn is not as inauspicious and deadly as it is supposed to be
 isaliye vah shatru nahi mitra he
 Saturn is the only planet to give salvation
 satya to yah hi he ki shani prakruti main santulan paidaa karata he, or har praani ke saath uchit nyaay karata he
 Those who give shelter to unfair asymmetry and unnatural parity, Shani only punishes them

 According to the scriptures, Shani Dev was born from the womb of the shadow of the sun's wife, noun, when Shani Dev was in the womb of the shadow, then the shadow was so much devoted to the devotion of Lord Shankar that he did not purify himself until he ate his food, which effected his son
 But his character became black and when he saw the black moon of Saturn, Surya accused his wife Chhaya that Shani is not my son! Since then Shani used to be hostile to his father! Shani Dev got power like his father Surya by pleasing Lord Shiva through his spiritual penance and Shivji asked Shani Dev to ask for a boon, then Shani Dev prayed that my mother Chhaya is being defeated in ages, Father has been insulted many times by Father Surya! So mother's wish is that my son avenge my insults to his father and become even more powerful than him! Then Lord Shankar gave a boon and said that you will have the best place among the Navagrahas! Human beings, will the gods also be afraid of your name! For more information see link Shani shani ke sambandh me hame puraanon main anek aakhyaan milte hai
 The father cursed her due to the deceit of the mother
 The father means that the Sun said, "may you be a retarded planet with cruel eyesight"
 It is also a legend that the king to save his kingdom from severe famine from the wrath of Saturn
 When Dashrath came to confront him, seeing his efforts, Shani asked him to ask for a boon
 Raja Dashrath duly praised him and pleased him
 padam puraana main is prasang kaa savistaar varnan he
 In the Brahmavaivarta Purana, Shani has told Jagat Janani Parvati that i pay for the birth of a person for a hundred births
 Once when Vishnupriya Lakshmi asked Shani why do you harm the natives, why all of you are oppressed by your influence While living, Shani Maharaj replied, "mateshwari, i have no fault in him, the Supreme Father, the Supreme God, has appointed me as the Judge of all the three worlds, Iye whatever injustices within the three realms, punish my job "is one more narrative and get that kind of sage August appealed when Saturn, so he had earned his freedom from demons
 jis kisi ne bhi anyaay kiya, unako hi unhone dand diya, chaahe vah bhagwaan shiv kii ardhangini sati rahi hon, jinhone sita kaa rup rakhane ke baad baba bhole nath se jhooth bolkar apni safaai di or parinaam main unako apane hi pita kii yajna main havan kunda me jal kar marane ke liye shani dev ne vivash kar diya, athwa raja harishchandr rahe hon, jinke daan dene ke abhimaan ke kaaran saptanik bazaar me bikna pada or,shmashaan kii rakhwali tak kerani paddy, yaa raja nal or damyanti ko hi le lijiye, jinke tuchh paapon kii sajaa ke liye unhe dar dar kaa hokar bhatakana pada, or bhooni hui machhliyaan tak pani mai tair kar bhaag gayi, fir saadhaaran manushya ke dwaara jo bhi mansa, vaachaa, karmana, paap kar diya jaataa he vah chaahe jane me kiya jaay yaa anjaane main, use bhugatna to padega hi
 In the Matsya Purana, Mahatma Shani Dev's body is like sapphire of Indra Kanti, he is riding on a vulture, bow is arrow in hand, there is a bridesmaid with one hand, the terrible form of Shani Dev is also frightening
 shani paapiyon ke liye hameshaa hi sanhaarak hai
 There are many stories in Western literature also, there are many temples of Shani Dev, there are many temples of Shani Dev in India too, such as Shinganapur, Kokila forest of Vrindavan, Shani Sashraji of Gwalior, Delhi and Maharaj Shani's temple in many cities
 navagrahon ke kaksh kram main shani surya se sarvaadhik duuri par atthasi crores, iksth lakh mile dur he
 The distance from Earth to Saturn is seventy-seven million, thirty-three million, forty-three thousand miles away

 Saturn is considered the third, seventh, and tenth drishti
 shani surya,chandra,mangal kaa shatru,budh,shukr ko mitra tathaa guru ko sam maanata he
 In physical diseases, Saturn is considered to be a factor in air disorders, tremors, bones and dental diseases
 janm kundali ke baarah bhaavon me janm ke samay shani apni gati or jataka ko diye jane vaale falon ke prati bhavanusaar jataka ke jivan ke andar kya utaar or chadhaav milenge, sabakaa vrutant kah detaa he
 Saturn is cool and Saturn is the one to give coolness, the name of Sun is bright and the name of Saturn is dark, the reason for making its place in the first house is that Shani will cause mourning in the speed of its transit and in its condition, as soon as the suffering of mourning in the creature comes He forgets everything back and forth and remains lost only in the dark
 shani jaadu tone kaa kaarak tab ban jaataa he, jab shani pehle bhav me apni gati detaa he, pehla bhav hi aukaat hoti he, andhere me jab aukaat chupane lage, roshni se hi pahichaan hoti he or jab aukaat chuphi hui ho to shani kaa syah andheraa hi mana ja saktaa he
 There are many forms of darkness, a darkness is one which causes nothing to be seen, it is considered to be the darkness of the eyes, one is also to understand the darkness, there is something in front, and something is understood, a darkness Evil is the reason, the goodness of a person or a creature is hidden in the evils, it is also considered as the darkness of Saturn, the name is dark, no one knows who it is And where has come from, who is mother and who is father, etc
 The concealment in any form is also considered due to Saturn, the person becomes the effigy of cunning by Saturn of the first house
 By placing a position inside the house, one looks at the third house, the third one is of his younger brother and sister, also of his inner strength, and also of might, whatever we say to others, any means
