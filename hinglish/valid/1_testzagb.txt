 Its area is 2,69,837 sq km
 is rajya kaa naam colorado nadi ke naam par padaa, jiskaa naam spani yatriyon ne rio colorado rakhaa tha
 The territory of Colorado was consolidated on 28 February 1861, and US President Ulysses Ass Grant signed a proclamation on 1 August 1876 and incorporated it into the US
 colorado ko "shatkeey rajya" bhi kaha jaataa he jo iskaa upnaam he kyonki yah america swatantrata kii ghoshnaa ke sau varsh puure hone ke 28 din baad rajya bana tha

 In economics, a complementary object is one whose resistance is negative
 yah ek vaikipak vatu ke vaparat hota he
 That is, when there is a decrease in the price of an object, there is an increase in demand for the object
 iske vaparat kasi ay vatu k kamat badhane par, vatu k maang m vatu k maang ghat jaati he yad vatu e or bi ek duusare ke poorak he, vatu e k kamat badhane se uskaa maang va bai ore aa jayega jaske kaaran vatu bi kaa maang va andar k ore aayega |athaat don vatuon k maang kam ho jaaegi | vatu e k kamat ghatane par vatu e kaa maang va dai ore jayega jaske kaaran vatu bi kaa maang va baahar k ore chalaa jayega | athaat don vatuon k maang bad jaaegi| iskaa ath hota he k don vatuon k maang ek duusare se sambandhat he
 If the demand for one increases, the demand for the other will also increase and if the demand for one decreases, then the demand for the other item will also decrease
 The values of complementary objects are related to each other in a similar way
 yad ek k kamat badhati he to duusare vatu k kamat bhi bad jaati he or iskaa vaparat bhi hota he
 In contrast, the price and demand in alternative objects are related to the opposite object of one object
 That is, if the price and demand of one object increases, then the price and demand of the other object will decrease
 yad do vatu ek duusare ke poorak he to ve sanyut maang kaa anubhav karte ha| udhaaharan ke lae, rager lead k maang chure k sanyaa par nabar hoti he
 This is the reason that the knife is sometimes sold at a loss to increase the demand for razor lead
 
 Recent research into food consumption has led to psychological, or psychological differences in how the consumption of an object affects the consumption of its supplement

 Cola consumers' desire to pay for a voucher for a cheeseburger increases
 iskaa ek udhaaharan he hot dog or hot dog ban k maang | hot dog k aaput or maang c m bataai gai he, jasm hot dog k ranbhak maang D1 he
 Suppose the initial cost of a hot dog is P1 and its initial demand is Q1
 yad hot dog ban k kamat kasi sanyaa se ghat jaati he, to is ghataav ke kaaran hot dog k maang bad jaaegi | maang badhane ke kaaran maang va baahar k ore chalaa jayega | athath nai that D2 par | yad ham ek narantar aaput s maanate ha to hot dog k nai maang D2 or nai kamat P2 ho jaaegi | is udhaaharan vaara yah kaha ja saktaa he k poorak vatue vah hoti he jo ek saath khapat k jaati he
 That is, if the demand for one object increases, the demand for the other also increases
 anya udaahranon main shaamil hai: The ideal supplement is that which has to be consumed always with another

 There is no need for more ribs as the account will not have rubber to eliminate its mistakes
 More rubber than this is not useful because it will not be so ribbed that it can make mistakes

 Rivers and mountains, plants and animals, mata amritanandmayi devi ek hindu aadhyatmik netri va guru hai, jinhen unke anuyaayi sant ke rup main sammaan dete hai or "ammaa ", "ammachi" yaa "maa" ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 He is widely respected for his humanitarian activities
 kabhi-kabhi unki ore "prem se gale lagane vaali sant" ke naam se bhi sanket kiya jaataa he
 According to Swami Amritasvarupanand Puri, the vice-president of Mata Amritanandamayi Math, “it is as natural for Amma to overcome the grief of others as it is to wipe the tears of her eyes
 dusron kii khushi main hi ammaa kii khushi he
 Amma considers her safety only while protecting others
 dusron ke vishram main hi ammaa kaa vishram he
 This is Amma's dream
 or yahi vah sapana he jiske liye maa ne apana jivan maanavtaa ke jaagran ke prati samarpit kar diya he
 " mata amritanandmayi devi kaa janm paryakadvu ke chote se gaanv alppad panchayat, jila kolum, kerala main 1953 main sudhamani idmannel ke rup main hua tha
 At the age of 9, she stopped going to school and she took full time to look after her younger siblings and do domestic work
 in kaaryon ke ek hisse ke rup main sudhamani idmannel apane parivaar kii gaayon or bakriyon ke liye apane padosiyon se bachaa hua bhojan ekatra karti thim
 Amma says that in those days she was going through extreme poverty due to extreme poverty and suffering of other people
 ve apane ghar se in logon ke liye vastra or khaanaa laati thim
 His family, which was not rich, used to scold and punish him for this
 ammaa kabhi kabhi achaanak hi logon ko dukh se raahat pahunchane ke liye unhen gale se laga leti thim
 While at that time a 14-year-old girl was not allowed to touch anyone, especially men
 lekin apane mata-pita se vipareet pratikriyaayein milane ke baavjood bhi ammaa aisa hi karti raheen
 Talking about embracing others, Amma said, "I don't see whether she is a woman or a man
 i don't see anyone as different from myself
 i have a constant love stream flowing towards all the creations of the world
" yah meraa janmajaat swabhaav he
 a physician's duty is to treat patients
 "isi prakaar meraa kartavya un logon ko santvanaa dena he jo ksht main hai
 " unke mata-pita dwaara unke vivaah ke anekon prayaason ke baavjood bhi ammaa ne sabhi nivedakon ko asweekaar kar diya
 In 1981, when a number of inquisitive travelers came and lived in Amma's property to become disciples of her parents, a world-class organization, Mata Amritanandamayi Math was established
 ammaa is math kii adhyaksh thim
 Today Mata Amritanandamayi Math is engaged in many spiritual and charitable activities
 1987 main, apane shraddhaluon ke anurodh par, ammaa vishwa ke sabhi deshon main kaarykram yojit karne lageen
 tab se ve prativarsh aisa karti hai
 Countries where Amma's events have been held include: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Dubai, England, Finland, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mauritius, Reunion, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States
 She also makes annual visits to India every year

 Therefore, in philosophy, the viewer has the ability to provide good luck, well-being and divine influence
 ammaa ke anuyaayi is shabd kaa prayog vishisht rup se prempurvak aalingan kiye jane ke behad mangapurn sanskaar ke liye karte hai
 Amma has been giving darshan in this way since her teens
 yah pratha kis prakaar shuru hui is sambandh main ammaa bataati hai ki, "log yahaan aakar apni samasyaon ke bare main bataaya karte the
 They used to cry and i used to wipe their tears
 jab ve rote-rote meri god main gir jaaya karte the, to mai unhen gale se laga leti thi
 Then the next person also expected me to behave like this
 

or is tarah se yah rivaaz ban gaya
 "amma's organization, Mata Amritanandamayi Math, claims that Amma has embraced more than 29 million people of this world with her neck
 · When in 2002, he was asked what he thought was his hug to help the sick of the world
 Amma said, "I don't say that i can solve their problems 100 percent
 Trying to change this world is the same as straightening the crooked tail of a dog
 But people are born from society is
 isliye logon ko prabhavit karne ke dwaara, aap is samaaj main parivartan laa sakate hai or iske dwaara is sansar main parivartan laayaa ja saktaa he
 You can make changes, but you cannot change it completely
 The war going on in each person's brain is responsible for the actual wars
 isliye yadi aap logon ko sparsh kar sakate hai, to ap is vishwa ko bhi sparsh kar sakate hai
 " ammaa kaa yah darshan hi unke jivan kaa centre he kyonki 1970 ke uttarardh se vah lagbhag pratidin hi logon se milti hai
 Along with this, the number of people coming to get Amma's blessing is increasing continuously, sometimes it happens that she keeps on giving darshan continuously for 20 hours
 2004 kii ek pustak from ammaa'za heart, main ankit samvaad main ammaa kahati hai; "jab tak mere ye haath zaraa bhi hill paane or mere paas aane vaale logon tak pahunch paane main samarth rahenge or jab tak mujhamen rote hue vyakti ke kandhe par apana haath rakhane or par prem se haath pherane tathaa unke aansu ponchney kii shakti rahegi, tab tak yah ammaa darshan detii rahegi
 is nashwar sansar kaa ant hone tak, logon par prem se haath pherana, unhen santvanaa dena or unke aansu ponchna, yahi ammaa kii ichha he
 " pustak da timeles path, main ammaa ke ek varisht shishy, swami ramakrishnananda puri likhte hai: "ammaa dwaara man main baithaaya gaya paath thik vaisaa hi he jaisaa ki hamaare vedon main diya gaya he or unke baad ke paaramparik dharmik granthon main sankshep main doharaaya gaya he jaise bhagavad gita
" ammaa swayan hi kahati hai, "karm, gyaan or bhakthi yah teenon hi aavashyak hai
 If devotion and karma are two wings of a bird, then knowledge is the end
 in teenon kii sahaayta se hi pakshi unchaaiyon tak pahunch saktaa he
 "she sees various prayers and spiritual conventions of all religions as diverse methods for the sole purpose of purification of the brain
 iske saath hi ammaa dhyaan, karm yoga par aadhaarit kriyaaon, paroapkaar or karunaa, dhairya, dayaa, aatm niyantran jaise divine gunon ke vikaas ke mahatv par bhi bal detii hai, ammaa kahati hai ki in gunon kaa abhyaas hamaare mashtishk ko parishkrut karata he, ise antim satya ko aatmsaat karne ke yogya banaata he: antim satya yah he ki hamaara astitv is sharir or mashtishk kii seemaa main simit nahin hai apitu yah ek aanandamay chetana he jo is brahmand ke advait adhbstar ke rup main kaary karti he
 This idea is called Amma Jivanmukti
 ammaa kahati hai, "jeevanmukti koi aisi avasthaa nahin he jise mrityu ke baad praapt kiya jaye or naa hi aapako iskaa anubhav yaa prapti kisi duusare sansar main hogi
 yah purna chetana or samavritti kii ek avasthaa he jiskaa anubhav is jivit sharir ko dhaaran kiye hue hi isi sansar main abhi hi kiya ja saktaa he
 After experiencing this highest truth by integrating with one's self, such a blissful self does not need to be born again
 She integrates with infinite consciousness
 " Amma's worldwide charitable mission includes 100,000 homes for the homeless, 3 orphanage shelters, and relief-and-rehabilitation, free medical care, widows and disabled persons faced with disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
 Pensions, environmental protection groups, renovation of slums, care centers for the aged and free clothing and food for the poor, etc
 The order is included
 yah pariyojnaayen anekon sanghathanon dwaara sanchalit kii jaati hai jisame mata amritanandmayi math, mata amritanandmayi centre, ammaa-europe, ammaa-japan, ammaa-kenya, ammaa-australia aadi shaamil hai
 All these organizations are jointly known as Embracing the World
 jab 2004 main unase yah poocha gaya ki unke dharmarth mishan kaa vikaas kaisaa chal rahaa he to ammaa ne kaha, "jahaan tak gatividhiyon kii baat he yah kisi yojana par aadhaarit nahin hai
 Everything happens spontaneously
 garibon or vyathit logon kii durdasha dekhakar ek kaary hi duusare kaary kaa madhyam bana
 ammaa prayek vyakti se milti hai, ve pratyaksh hi unki samasyaon ko dekhati hai or unke kashton ko dur karne kaa prayaas karti hai
 ॐ Loka: Samasta: Sukhino Bhavantu, it is one of the main mantras of Sanatan Dharma, which means, 'let all the creatures of this world be happy and peaceful
' The spirit of this mantra has been made the medium of karma
 " Most of the work is done by volunteers as a spiritual practice
 "yah ammaa kii ichha he ki unke sabhi bachche is vishwa main prem or shanti ke prasar ke liye apana jivan samarpit kar den
 ammaa kahati hai "garibon tathaa peediton ke liye sachhee karunaa hi ishwar ke prati sachcha prem or bhakthi he
 "" My children feed them who are hungry, help the poor, comfort the miserable, bring relief to the afflicted and are generous to all
 " Amma is also very famous for her devotional music
 unke dwaara gaaye gaye bhajanon kii 100 se adhik recording, 20 se bhi adhik bhashaaon main uplabdh hai
 He has composed dozens of hymns and molded them according to traditional ragas
 bhakthi geeton ko aadhyatmik abhyaas ke rup main gaaye jane ke sambandh main ammaa kahati hai, "yadi bhajanon ko ekaagratha ke saath gaya jaye to yah gayak, shrota or prakruti ke liye laabhprad hota he
 Later when the audience contemplates the hymn, they try to conform to the recited texts in the hymns
 " ammaa kahati hai ki aaj ke sansar main, praayah logon ke liye dhyaan ke dauraan ekagra hona kathin ho jaataa he, lekin bhakthi gayan ke dwaara yah ekaagratha saralata se praapt kii ja sakati he
 Amma's disciples have composed nearly a dozen books of his teachings by scripting his dialogues with devotees and spiritual explorers
 unhone vibhinn antarrashtriya sabhaaon main jo bhaashan die hai unhen bhi pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya gaya he
 Other senior disciples including Swami Ramakrishnananda Puri, Swami Turiamritnand Puri, Swami Paramatmanand and Swami Krishnamitrananda Pran have also written books regarding their experiences with Amma and the teachings of Amma
 mata amritanandmayi math ke upaadhyaksh, swami amruthasvarupanand puri, ne ammaa kii ek jeevani bhi likhi he
 Mata Amritanandamayi Math also publishes Matravani and a quartile magazine Immortal Bliss, a spiritual journal
 leaders Mr
 Pattathanam, who is the chairman of the Indian Resilient Association and lives in Kerala, has written a controversial critical book titled Math Amritanandamayi: Sacred Stories and Reality
 unhone yah daawa kiya he ki sudhamani dwaara kiye jane vaale sabhi chamatkaar jhuthe hai or unke ashram tathaa uske aasapaas kai sandehaaspad mautein hui hai, jiname police dwaara chaanbin kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 This discovery by him includes extensive references to judicial records, newspaper reports and citations given by famous literary figures, including an interview with close relatives of the monastery and Amritanandamayi himself
 us samay amritanandmayi adhik prasiddh nahin thim, baad main prasiddhi badhane par math ne is pustak ke lekhak ke abhayojan kii maang kii or 2004 main is sambandh main kaarywahi ke liye sarkaar par dabaav daalaa
 The state government allowed the prosecution of the owner of the publishing company, the publisher of this book and Pattathanam

 The order eventually attracted international attention and was later scrapped when criticized by humanists, intellectuals, writers, and the Communist Party

 The social reform movements in Bengal in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the rise of patriot-nationalist consciousness and the unique progress made in literature-art-culture are called the renaissance of Bengal
 is dauraan samaaj sudhaarkon, sahityakaron or kalakaaron ne stri, vivaah, dahej, jatipratha or dharm sambandhi sthapit paramparaon ko chunauti di
 This development of Bengal left an indelible mark on the creations of the overall Indian modernity
 isi navajagaran ke dauraan bhartiya rashtrawaad ke shuruaati roopon kii sanrachanaayen saamne aayin
 The renaissance of Bengal is believed to extend from Raja Rammohan Roy to Rabindranath Thakur
 is avadhi kaa suvyavyasthit adhyayan karne vaale itihaaskaar sushobhan sarkaar likhte hai, ‘angrezi raaj, poonjividi arthvyavastha or aadhunik pashchimi samskruti kaa sabase pehla prabhaav bengal par padaa jisase ek aisa navajagaran hua jise aamtaur par bengal ke rinesaan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Bengal's conscious awareness of the changing modern world for almost a century was ahead of the rest of India
 is lihaaz se kaha ja saktaa he ki bharat ke aadhunik jaagran main bengal dwaara nibhaai gayi bhoomika kii tulana europee rinesaan ke sandarbh main italy kii bhoomika se kii ja sakati he
 'like the Italian Renaissance, the renaissance of Bengal was not a mass movement
 isaki prakriya or prasar bhadralok tak hi simit tha
 In Bhadralok too, the renaissance had its influence mostly on the Hindu part
 is dauraan kuch musalmaan hastiyaan bhi ubharin, par bengal kaa navajagaran aanshik rup se hi musalmaan navajagaran kaha ja saktaa he
 It is broadly believed that Bengal's renaissance began with Rammohan Roy and ended with Rabindranath Thakur
 sushobhan sarkaar ne ise paanch charnon main baant kar dekhne kaa prayaas kiya he : pehali avadhi 1814 se 1833, jisaki kendriya hasti raja rammohan raay the
 In 1814 he came to live in Kolkata and in 1833 he died in London
 duusari avadhi unki mrityu se 1857 ke vidroh tak jaati he
 The third period extends to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885
 chauthi avadhi 1905 main bengal ke vibhaajan tak or paanchavin avadhi swadeshi andolan se asahyog andolan or mahatma gandhi ke netritv kii shuruyaat tak yani 1919 tak maani gayi he
 There is a parable about Rammohun Rai that can be read as a metaphor for his personality
 kaha jaataa he ki unke do ghar the
 In terms of food, clothing and living, one used to live like a Victorian Gentileman and the other like a traditional Bengali Brahmin
 darasal, unke vyaktitv or krititv kii sabase badi visheshta thi purv or pashchim kaa sanshleshan
 However, this parable also does not define his stereotypical personality
 1820 main unki kriti ‘parasepts of jisas’ kaa prakaashan hua jisamen isa ke naitik sandesh ko isai tatvagyan or chamatkaar kathaon se alag karke pesh kiya gaya tha
 The Christian clergy class in Bengal was angered by his efforts
 uske virodh ke parinamswaroop rammohan raay ne isai janata ke naam teen apilen jari karke apane vichaaron ko or spashtataa pradaan kii
 Along with this, he also tried to highlight the ideological continuity of Hindu theism from the Vedas by publishing the Brahmanical magazine
 rammohan ne apane dharmik vichaaron ko dharti par utaarne ke liye 20 agast 1828 ko ‘brahm sabha’ kaa gathan kiya
 This process resulted in the establishment of a church in 1830 and the Brahmo Samaj movement began which continued to influence the consciousness of Bengali society for a long time
 1818 se 1829 ke bich rammohan raay ne sati pratha jaisi buraai par akraman karte hue teen rachanaayen prakashit kin
 His efforts are credited for creating public opinion against the practice of Sati and persuading the British to ban it
 rammohan ne aadhunik shiksha or vishesh taur se stri shiksha ke prasar main agua bhoomika nibhaai
 He is also called the creator of Bangla prose
 bengal rinesaan ke is daur main rammohan ke prayaason ko dohare virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 On the one hand he was opposed by anti-reform traditional writers and scholars like Radhakant Deb, Gaurikant Bhattacharya and Bhavani Charan Banerjee, while he also faced criticism from the French Revolution and English Radicalism which was led by 'young Bengal' and its anglo-indin The leader was in the hands of Henry Vivian Derozio
 yah alag baat he ki derozio ke anuyaayi apane kaamon or vaktrutaaon se samaaj ko chaunkaane ke alaava koi sthai asar nahin daal paye
 However, the soft program of social reforms based on Rammohan's tradition continued even after his death
 uski kaman devendranath thakur or akshay kumaar dutt ke haathon main thi
 Meanwhile, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar campaigned against child marriage and polygamy
 haalaanki yang bengal andolan 1842 main vidhwaa vivaah ke paksh main awaz uthaa chukaa tha, par vidyasagar ke prayaason se hi ise lokapriy andolan kaa rup mila
 The renaissance of Bengal after the Revolt of 1857 entered the literary revolution and through it the era of nationalist thought
 nil kii kheti karwaane vaale angrezon ke julmon ke kilaaf kisaanon ke sangharsh main bengali buddhijiviyon ne bhi apni awaz milaayi
 Deenbandhu Mitra's play 'neel Darpan' shook the mind of Bengal
 micel madhusudan dutt ne uskaa angrezi anuwaad prakashit kiya jiske kilaaf adaalat ne ek hazaar rupee ke zurmaane kii sazaa sunaayi
 Michaels announced the possibilities of a new Bengali poem in 1860 by creating Meghanad-slaughter
 1865 main bankim chandra chatarji kaa surya unke pehle aitihaasik upanyaas durgeshnandini ke saath bengali saanskrithik kshitij par uga
 In 1873 he started the tradition of social novels through poisoning
 1879 main ‘samya’ sheershak se niabandh likh kar bankim ne samtamulakata or utopian samaajwaad ke prati rujhaan dikhaaya, par 1882 main aanandamath likh kar ve deshbhaktipurna punarutthanavaad kii lahar main bah gayi
 The song 'vande Mataram' recorded in the same composition is one of the three national anthems of India
 saahitiyik unmesh ke saath- saath bengali navajagaran ne itihaas lekhan or samaaj-vigyaan ke anya kshetron main yogadan kii parampara kaa sutarapaat bhi kiya
 This period was particularly eventful in terms of religious reforms and revivalism
 ek taraf to keshav chandra sen ke netritv main yuva brahm samaji sudhaar andolan kii alakh jagaaye hue the, duusari taraf wahabi asantosh khadbada rahaa tha or nav- hinduvad kii padchaap sunaayi de rahi thi
 It was during this period that Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa of Dakshineswar declared all religious beliefs to be holy through his magnetic personality
 isai dharmantaran ko hawa dene vaala protestant ugravad isse kamazor hua or parampara ke pairokaron ko thodi raahat mili
 Swami Vivekananda, a young disciple of Paramahamsa, gained international fame from his speech delivered at the World Releases Conference in 1893 and formulated his particular style of idealistic nationalism
 chaar saal tak pashchim kaa daura karke laute to 1897 main unka rashtriya nayak kii tarah swaagat kiya gaya
 The period after 1861 was something in which the most favorite word of Bengali intellectual society became 'rashtriya'
 rajanarayan bose, navagopal mitra, jyotirindranath thakur or bhoodev mukherjee kii aguai main kai tarah kii gatividhiyaan chalin jinamein hindu meley kaa aayojan ullekhneey tha jo kareeb das saal tak kolkata ko aalodit karata rahaa
 The period after 1870 was a period of political movements in which the leadership of Surendranath Banerjee emerged who was known as the 'king of the Desolate of Bengal'
 surendranath ke jujharupan kaaran ke kaaran angrez unka naam bigaad kar ‘sarender note’ banerjee bhi kehete the
 In 1876, Banerjee founded the 'indin Association' whose 1883 national conference gave rise to the idea of creating a national organization for all Indians
 iskaa parinaam 1885 main bhartiya rashtriya congress kii aitihaasik sthapana ke rup main niklaa
 Bengali intellectuals participated fiercely in the activities of the Congress and by 1903 the presidency of the Congress sessions went to their account seven times
 bengal ne maharashtra or punjab ke saath mil kar congress ke garmdali dhade kii rachana karne main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai
 The late period of Bengal's Navajaran was marked by dramatists like Girish Chandra Ghosh, historical and social novelist like Ramesh Chandra Dutt, Muslim poet like Mir Musharraf Hussain, Jagdish Chandra Bose and Prafulla Chandra Rai in Bankim's tradition
 lekin, rabindranath thakur kii pratibha ke saamne ye sabhi pratibhaaen feeki pad gayin
 Rabindranath, who attracted the attention of everyone by reciting his patriotic poems at the Hindu fair, gave a whole new era to his era by his creative and ideological literature
 unhone apane yug par aalochanatmak drushti phenki
 In 1901, through his creation Nishniad, he was seen to be attacking the advocates of Bengali Renaissance who were not ready to implement those ideals in their family life
 1913 main gitanjali ke liye sahitya kaa nobel puraskaar jeetne vaale rabindranath ne bang- bhang virodh or swadeshi andolan kii raajnneeti ko sarvatha naye drushtikon se dekha
 He expressed unhappiness over the minimal participation of Muslims in this movement and criticized the inauspicious dimensions inherent in nationalism
 gandhi ke saath unki bahason main aane vaale bharat kii duvidhaon kii jhalak dekhi ja sakati thi

 Hadi Rani was the wife of Sardar Rao Ratan Singh Chulawat of Sulumbar
 shaadi ko mahaj ek saptaah hua tha
 Neither the mehndi of the hands was left nor the foot treads
 subah kaa samay tha
 The chieftain was in a deep sleep
 rani saj dhajkar raja ko jagaane ai
 His eyesight was palpable
 rani ne hansi thitholi se unhen jagaanaa chaha
 Meanwhile, the concierge came and stood there
 raja kaa dhyaan na jane par rani ne kaha, maharana kaa doot kaaphi der se khadaa he
 He wants to meet Thakur immediately
 aapke liye koi aavashyak patr laayaa he use abhi dena jaruri he
 News of the arrival of the messenger in untimely
 thakur hakkaa bakka rah gaya
 They started thinking that there must be something special
 rana ko pataa he ki vah abhi hi byaah kar ke laute hai
 Emergency can only be timed
 usne hadi rani ko apane kaksh main jane ko kaha, doot kaa turant laakar bithaao
 i come soon after dealing with routine, Hada Sardar told the concierge
 sardaar jaldi jaldi main nivrutt hokar baahar aayaa
 Suddenly, Rana's messenger sitting in the meeting looked at him
 aupchaarikta ke baad thakur ne doot se kaha, are shardool tu
 How so morning Has the sister-in-law driven out of the house? All the fun was gritty again
 sardaar ne phir doot se kaha, teri nai bhabhi avashya tum par naaraaz hokar andar gai hogi
 It is new
 isliye bechaari kuch nahin boli
 What a disaster it was
 do din to chaiyn kii bansi baja lene dete
 Why did Mian come in the middle of his wife as a bone in the cabana
 acha bolo rana ne mujhe kyon yaad kiya he? vah tahaakaa markar hans padaa
 The two had a deep friendship
 saamaanya din agar hote to vah bhi hansi main jawaab detaa
 Shardul himself was also very ticklish
 vah hansi majaak ke bina ek kshan ko bhi nahin rah saktaa tha, lekin vah bada gambhir tha
 Stop laughing friend sachmuch badi sankat kii ghadi aa gai he
 i also want to return immediately
 yah kahkar sahasaa vah chup ho gaya
 Had gone as a wedding party to his friend
 uske chehre par chai gambhirtha kii rekhaon ko dekhakar haada sardaar kaa man ashankit ho uthaa
 Nothing untoward has really happened
 doot sankoch rahaa tha ki is samay rana kii chitthee vah mitra ko de yaa nahin
 He brought Hada Sardar with instructions to leave immediately for the war
 use mitra ke shabd samaran ho rahe the
 The red marks of Mahawar in the nails of Hada's feet still emerged like that
 nav vivaahit hadi rani ke haathon kii menhadi bhi to abhi sukhi na hogi
 The husband and wife did not recognize each other properly
 kitna dukhadaayi hoga unka bichhoh? yah samaran karte hi vah sihar uthaa
 Do not know what is in the war? By the way, Rajput considers death as a toy
 ant main ji kadaa karke usne haada sardaar ke haathon main rana rajsingh kaa patr thama diya
 Rana had a message for him
 veeravar
 Immediately stop Aurangzeb's army with his army
 musalmaan sena uski sahaayta ko aage bad rahi he
 Right now i am surrounded by Aurangzeb
 uski sahaayta ko bad rahi fouj ko kuch samay ke liye uljhaakar rakhana he taaki vah sheeghra hi aage na bad sake tab tak main puraa kaam nipat letaa hum
 You can do this work very efficiently
 yadhyapi yah bada khatarnaak he
 You may have to put your life as well
 mujhe tum par bharosa he
 It was a test for Hadra Sardar
 ek ore mughalon kii vipul sena or uski sainik tukdi ati alp he
 Rana Raj Singh had liberated the peeled areas of Mewar from the clutches of the Mughals
 aurangzeb ke pita shahjahan ne apni edi chotii kii takat laga di thi
 He sat silently
 ab shashan kii bagdor aurangzeb ke haathon main ai thi
 Charumati's marriage to Rana fueled her hostility
 isi bich main ek baat or ho gayin thi jisane rajsingh or aurangzeb ko aamane saamne laakar khadaa kar diya tha
 This was an insult to the entire Hindu caste
 islam ko kubul karo yaa hindu bane rahane kaa dand baro
 By saying this, he imposed jizya tax on Hindus
 rana rajsingh ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 Even his mind was not tolerating it
 iskaa parinaam yah hua kai anya hindu raajaaon ne use apane yahaan lagu karne main anakani kii
 His courage was increased
 gulaami kii zanjeeron ko tod phenkane kii agni jo mand pad gayin thi phir se prajjwalit ho gai thi
 Shivaji in the south, Chhatrasal in Bundelkhand, Guru Govind Singh in Punjab, Rathore Veer Durgadas in Marwar stood up against the Mughal Sultanate
 yahaan tak ki amer ke mirza raja jaisingh or marwar ke jaswant singh jo mughal sultanate ke do pramukh stambh the
 In them too, sympathy was generated towards freedom lovers
 mughal badshaah ne ek badi sena lekar mewar par akraman kar diya tha
 Rana Raj Singh did three parts of the army
 mughal sena ke aravali main na ghusane dene kaa daayitv apane bete jaisingh ko saupa tha
 The second son, Bhim Singh, was tasked to stop Ajmer's aid to the emperor
 ve swayan akbar or durgadas rathod ke saath aurangzeb kii sena par tut pade the
 He was conquered on all fronts
 badshaah aurangzeb kii badi priy cokesian begum bandi bana lee gayin thi
 Aurangzeb could somehow save his life with great difficulty
 mewar ke maharana kii yah jeet aisi thi ki unke jivan kaal main phir kabhi aurangzeb unke viruddh sir na uthaa sakaa tha
 But was the victory credited only to Rana or to someone else? Hada Rani and Hada Sardar did not feel sad in any way
 mughal badshaah jab chaaron ore rajputon se ghir gaye
 His life was also put to shame
 uskaa bachakar nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya tha tab usne dilli se apni sahaayta ke liye atirikt sena bulawaai thi
 Rana had already known this
 unhone mughal sena ke maarg main avrodh utpann karan ke liye haada sardaar ko patr likhaa tha
 Shardul Singh reached the friend with the same message
 ek kshan kaa bhi vilamb na karte hue haada sardaar ne apane sainikon ko kooch karne kaa aadesh de diya tha
 Now he had reached her to seek a final farewell from his wife
 kesaria bana pahane yuddh vesh main saje pati ko dekhakar hadi rani chaunk padi vah achambhit thi
 Where did Swami go? so early
 abhi to aap kah rahe the ki chaar chah maheenon ke liye yuddh se fursat mili he aaraam se kategi yah kya? aashcharya mishrit shabdon main hadi rani pati se boli
 Dear
 pati ke shaury or parakram ko parakhane ke liye liye hi to kshatraniyan isi din kii pratiksha karti he
 That auspicious moment has just arrived
 desh ke shatruon se do do haath hone kaa avasar mila he
 i have to leave here without delay
 hansate-hansate vidaa do
 i do not know if there should be an appointment again or not, Hadar Sardar smiled and said to his wife
 haada sardaar kaa man ashankit tha
 Really, if not returned
 meri is ardhangini kaa kya hoga ? ek ore kartavya or duusari ore tha patni kaa moh
 His mind was trapped in this inner atmosphere
 usne patni ko rana rajsingh ke patr ke sambandh main puri baat vistaar se bataa di thi
 The husband's throat is filled with tears while asking for farewell, this hand could not remain hidden from Raji's sharp eyes
 yadhyapi haada sardaar ne use bharsak chhipaane kii koshish kii
 Desperate mind takes the person away from victory
 us vir bala ko yah samajhate der na lagi ki pati ranbhumi main to ja rahaa he par mohagrast hokar
 To get husband Vijayashree, she sacrificed her attachment to the altar of duty
 vah pati se boli swami jaraa thahrie
 i just arrived
 vah daudi-daudi andar gayin
 Decorated the plate of Aarti
 pati ke mastak par tikaa lagaaya, uski aarti utaari
 She spoke to her husband
 main dhanya ho gayin, aisa vir pati paakar
 We are with you for birth
 rajput ramaniyan isi din ke liye to putr ko janm detii hai aap jaaen swami
 i will wait for you at the door with the victory garland
 usne apane netron main umadte hue aansuon ko pi liya tha
 Did not want to weaken her husband
 chalate chalate pati usase bolaa priy
 i could not give you any happiness, its only sadness, will you forget me? If i don't live xxrep 4 


 
 uske vaakya puure bhi na ho paae the ki hadi rani ne uske mukh par hatheli rakh di
 Neither owner
 aisi ashubh baaten na bolon
 i am Veer Rajputni, then also Veer's wife
 apana antim dharm acchhee tarah jaanati hum aap nishchit hokar prasthaan karen
 Make the teeth of the enemies of the country sour
 yahi meri prarthana he
 a little chieftain put the horse up
 rani use ekatak niharti raheen jab tak vah ankhe se ojhal na ho gaya
 The storm of weakness that was hidden in his mind, which he had so far stopped, flowed out of his eyes
 haada sardaar apni sena ke saath hawa se bate karata uda ja rahaa tha
 But living in his mind, he was coming and said that my wife really does not let me go away? He would explain the mind, but his attention would go there
 ant main usase rahaa na gaya
 He halfway sent his trusted soldiers to the queen
 uskon phir se samaran karaayaa tha ki mujhe bhoolanaa mat
 i will definitely return sandesh vaahak ko aashwast kar rani ne lautaaya
 On the second day another carrier arrived
 phir vahi baat
 Then one came on the third day
 is baar vah patni ke naam sardaar kaa patr laayaa tha
 Dear, i am taking on enemies here
 angad ke samaan pair jamaarak unako roak diya he
 They have to move a bit
 yah to tumhaare raksha kavach kaa pratap he
 But i am missing you very much
 patr vaahak dwaara koi apni priy nishaani avashya bhej dena
 i will lighten my heart by looking at him
 hadi rani patr ko padhakar soch main pad gayin
 If the mind of the warring husband is in memory of me, if my face is moving in front of his eyes, how will he fight the enemies? vijay shri kaa varan kaise karenge? uske man main ek vichaar kaundha
 She said bravely to the soldier? i am giving you my last mark
 ise le jaakar unhen de dena
 Garnish with a platter and cover it with a beautiful cloth and take it to your gallant general
 kintu ise koi or na dekhe
 Try them openly
 saath main meraa yah patr bhi de dena

 The Jataka or Jataka Pali or Jataka stories are the 10th part of the Khuddakanikaya under the Sutpitaka of the Buddhist scripture Tripitaka
 in kathaon main mahatma buddha ke purv janmon kii kathayen hai
 Which is believed to have been told by Gautam Buddha himself, although some scholars believe that some Jataka stories have been told by his disciples after Gautam Buddha
 vishwa kii pracheenatam likhit kahaniyaan jataka kathaayen hai jisamen lagbhag 600 kahaniyaan sangrah kii gayi he
 This is an event dating back 300 years
 in kathaon main manoranjan ke madhyam se niti or dharm ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 The Jataka is the tenth famous text of the Khadak body
 jataka ko vastutah granth na kahkar granth samooh hi kahana adhik upyukt hoga
 Some of his plot is in the form of a complete book and sometimes his stories are in the form of brief epics
 jataka shabd jan dhaatu se bana he
 It means past or emotion
 ‘jan’ dhaatu main ‘kt’ pratyay jodakar yah shabd nirmit hota he
 When metal is used in the ghost sense, when the meaning is done, then the story and form are created
 bhav arth main prayukt karne par jaat-jani-janan-janm arth banataa he
 In this way, the meaning of the word 'jataka' is 'jat' meaning birth-related
 ‘jataka’ bhagwaan buddha ke purv janm sambandhi kathaayen he
 God Buddha is called Bodhisattva before he attains enlightenment
 ve us samay buddhatv ke liye ummidavaar hote hai or daan, sheel, maitri, satya aadi das parmitaaon athwa paripurnataaon kaa abhyaas karte hai
 They sacrifice their lives many times for the sake of spirituality
 is prakaar ve buddhatv kii yogyata kaa sampaadan karte hai
 The word Bodhisattva itself means industrial beings for Bodhi
 bodhi ke liye he satv jiskaa aisa arth bhi kuch vidwaanon ne kiya he
 In the Pali Sutras, we read many times, "before attaining enlightenment, at the time of not being Buddha, when i was a Bodhisattva", etc
 atah bodhisattva se spasht taatpary gyaan, satya dayaa aadi kaa abhyaas karne vaale us sadhak se he jiskaa aage chalakar buddha hona nishchit he
 Lord Buddha had not only been a Bodhisattva in his last birth before the state of enlightenment, but he also followed the Bodhisattva practice in many of his earlier births
 jataka kii kathaayen bhagavan buddha ke in vibhinn purvajanmon se jabaki ve bodhisattva rahe the, sambandhit hai
 He is portrayed as the protagonist in most stories
 kahani ke ve swayan nayak he
 Sometimes his place is secondary as an ordinary character and sometimes he is depicted as a spectator
 praayah prayek kahani kaa armbh is prakaar hota he-‘‘ek samay raja brahmadatt ke varanasi main rajya karte samay bodhisattva kurang mrug kii yoni se utpann hue athwa 


 sindhu paar ke ghodon ke kul main utpann hue athwa xxrep 5 
 bodhisattva brahmadatt ke amaatya the athwa 

bodhisattva goh kii yoni sein utpann hue aadi, aadi
 Some of the Jataka stories have been named from the first words of the saga that came in the Jataka, namely - Apataka Jataka; According to one's protagonist, vānupath jātaka; According to the births of the Bodhisattva, such as Nigradh Mig Jataka, Machta Jataka, etc
 sabhi jataka kathaayen gautamabuddha ke dwaara kahi gayi he, jataka buddha samaykalin he, jaatakon kii nishchit sankhya kitni he, iskaa nirnay karnaa bada kathin he
 According to the custom prevalent in Lanka, Burma and Siam, the Jataka are 550
 samantapasadika kii nidaan katha main bhi jaatakon kii sankhya itani hi bataai gai he
 '' Panasa Dhakani Panchasatani Jatakanti Veditabb
 ‘‘ atthasalini kii nidaan katha main bhi -pannasadhikani panchajatakasatani‘‘ he
 The number is broadly fixed
 jataka ke vartmaan rup main 547 jataka kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 But this number is also only upper
 jatakatthawannanakaar ne vishaywastu kii drushti se inhen paanch virgon main vibhajit kiya he- Many of the Jataka stories are also found in two places with little variation or have been embedded in each other, and likewise many Jataka stories are found in sutta-pitaka, vinaya-pitaka, and other Pali texts, but In the present form of Jataka is not stored
 atah jaatakon kii sankhya main kaaphi kami kii bhi or briddhi kii bhi sambhaavna he
 For example, the story of Munik Jataka and Saluk Jataka is same, but only two names have come from different places
 iske vipareet ‘munik jataka’ naam ke do jataka hote hue unki bhi katha bhinn-bhinn he
 This is also the case for two people named Machh Jataka
 kahi-kahin do swatantra jaatakon ko milakar ek tisare jataka kaa nirmaan kar diya gaya he
 For example, both the Panchapandit Jataka and the Dakarakkhas Jataka are inhabited by the Maha Ummag Jataka
 jo kathaayen jataka-katha ke rup main anyatra pai jaati hai, kintu ‘jataka’ main sangruhit nahin he, unka bhi kuch ullekh kar dena aavashyak hoga
 The Ghatikar of the Majjhim body- Sutta or Ghatikar Sutta is one such Jataka story which is not found in 'jataka'
 isi prakaar dirghanikaay kaa mahagovind sutt jo swayan jataka kii nidaan katha main bhi ‘mahagovind jataka’ ke naam se nirdisht hua he, jataka ke andar nahin paaya jaataa he
 Similarly, in Dhammapadatthakatha and Milind Panha, some such Jataka-stories are quoted, which are not stored in Jataka
 atah kuch jataka nishchit rup se kitne he iskaa thik nirnay nahin ho saktaa
 When we consider the number of the Jataka, the Jataka means a story with a special title, which describes the life-related event of the Bodhisattva, no matter how many different stories are interwoven in that one
 Are given
 yadi kul kahaniyaan gini jaay to jataka main kareeb teen hajaar kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 The Jatakas have in fact been compiled on the basis of sutta-pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 sutt -pitak main anek aisi kathaayen he jinka upyog vahaan upadesh dene ke liye kiya gaya he
 But the Bodhisattva is not mentioned in it
 yah kaam baad main karke prayek kahani ko jataka kaa rup de diya gaya he
 Tittir Jataka and Dighit Kosal Jataka are similarly constructed from Chullavagg and Mahavagga respectively of vinaya-pitaka
 manikanth jataka bhi vinay-pitak par hi aadhaarit he
 Similarly, the Kootadanta Sutta and Mahasudassana Sutta of the long-body and the Makhadeva Sutta of the Majjhim body are also Jataka in full sense
 kam se kam 13 jaatkaan kii khoj vidwaanon ne sutt pitak or vinay-pitak main kii hai
 Although the stories related to Rajkatha chor-katha and similar fears, war, village, corporation, city, district, women, panaghat, ghost and ghost etc
 were seen in terms of helplessness in the monk's union by calling it sordid stories
 phir bhi upadesh ke liye kathaon kaa upyog bhikshu log kuch-na-kuch maatra main karte hi the
 God himself has also preached religion through similes and parables
 buddha sanskrit granth saddharmpundaree sutara ke dwitiya parivart main bhi kaha gaya he ki buddha anek drushtaanton se tathaa jataka ke dwaara sab praaniyon ke kalyanarth upadesh karte hai
 Apart from Buddha, other Indian saints have been preaching religions with the help of fables and parables from the time of the Upanishads to the time of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
 isi pravriti ke aadhaar par jatakakathaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The stories prevalent in public society have also been taken somewhere, but they have been given a new moral form, which is a feature of Buddhism
 atah sabhi jataka kathaon par buddha dharm kii puri chhap he
 They may have the basis of folk lectures from earlier traditions, but their entire structure is compatible with the moral ideal of Buddhism
 buddha vachanon kaa vargeekaran nau angon ke rup main kiya gaya he, jinke naam hai- This nine types of division of the Buddha verses is only in terms of their style forms or patterns, not in terms of texts
 itane prakaar ke buddha upadesh hote the, yahi is vargeekaran kaa abhipraay he
 The division of the Buddha's verses into nine parts of which the number of Jataka is seventh is very ancient
 atah jataka kathaayen sarvansh main pali-sahitya ke mahatvapurn evam aavashyak ang hai
 Uncertainty about their numbers has arisen, especially due to their timely collection of Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka and other sources, and their own assortment of Pali Pitaka and their intermingling
 chull niddes main hamen keval 500 jaatakon kaa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 In the fifth century AD, Chinese traveler Fahyan saw pictures of 500 natives printed in Lanka
 dwitiya tritiy shatabdi isvi purv ke bharhut or sanchi ke stupon main jaatakon ke chitra ankit mili hai
 Out of which pictures of at least 27 or 29 natives were identified by Rais Davids
 tab se kuch anya jataka kahaniyon kii pahchaan bhi in stupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par kii ja chuki hai
 All these facts are indicative of the ancientness and development of the native
 sthaviravaadi pali sahitya ke samaan sanskrit buddha dharm ke granthon main bhi jataka kathaayen pai jaati hai
 Like the Nawang Buddha word of Pali, Dwad Sh Anga here is considered to be the scripture
 in donon hi jagah jataka ek ang yaa dharm-pravachan ke bhaag ke rup main vidyaman he
 In the Buddhist Sanskrit text Jatakamala, which is told the composition of Aryasur, 34 Jataka stories are found
 aryashur ko lamas, tarnath ne ashwaghosh kaa hi doosraa naam bataaya he parantu yah thik nahin jaan padataa he
 Probably he was a poet of the fourth century AD
 lokottaravaadiyon ke prasiddh granth mahavastu main jo 200 i0 purv se 400 i0 tak ke bich ke kaal main likhi gai, kareeb 80 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Some of them are similar to Pali Jataka and there are also some that are not found in Pali Jataka
 rais davids kaa kathan he ki jataka kaa sankalan or pranayan madhya desh main pracheen janakathaon ke aadhaar par hua
 Winternitz has also often expressed this view
 adhikansh jataka buddhakalin he
 The inscriptions of Sanchi and Bharhut's scenes on the stone-vestas give ample evidence of their pre-ashoka period
 jataka ke kaal or kartrutv ke sambandh main adhik prakaash uske saahitiyik rup or visheshtaon ke vivechan se padegaa
 Each Jataka tale is divided into five parts
 panchuppannavatthu kaa arth he vartmaan kaal kii ghatana yaa katha
 The incident that took place during the lifetime of Buddha is Pachauppannavatthu
 us ghatana ne bhagwaan ko kisi purvajanm ke vrut t ko kehane kaa avasar diya
 This is the circle of the past life is past
 prayek jataka kaa katha kii drushti sabase adhik mahatvapurn bhaag yah atitvatthu hi he
 According to this, Pachappannavatthu seems to have been built somewhere
 atitvatthu ke baad ek yaa anek gaathaayen aati hai
 Although they are related to the past only, but in some cases it is also related to the Pachappannavattu
 gaathaayen jataka ke pracheenatam ansh hai
 In fact only the gatakas are native
 pacchuppannavatthu aadi paanch bhaagon se samanvit jataka to vastav main jatakatthawannana yaa jataka main veyyakaran yaa atthav nnana aati he
 It contains interpretations and semantics of gathas
 sabase ant main samodhan aata he, jisamen atitvatthu ke paatro kaa buddha ke jivan kaal ke paatro ke saath sambandh milaayaa jaataa he, yatha us samay ataari par se shikaar khilne vaala shikari ab kaa dev dutt tha or kurung mrug to main tha hi, aadi aadi
 The Jataka contains the stories of the earlier births of the Buddha, while he completed various traditions in the form of the Bodhisattva and perfected his ability for enlightenment
 sutt-pitak ke pratham chaar nikaayon main buddha ke aitihaasik rup kii hi pratishtha he
 Later in the Jataka, they are able to relate their historical life to the earlier stories
 jatakatthakatha kii nidaan katha main buddha jivan ke teen nidaan bataaye gayi hai, duure nidaan main atyant dur ateet kii buddha jivan kii katha he, aisa mana jaataa he ki atyant sudur ateet main buddha sumedh tapasvi banakar utpann hue the
 At that time he showed great loyalty to Dipankar Buddha, as a result he later blessed him to be Buddha
 anek janmon tak vibhinn sharir dhaaran karte hue sume dha tapasvi kii sadhana chalati rahi
 In the end, after leaving his body as Vesantar king, he went to the illiterate world
 sumedh tapasvi ke rup se lekar tushit lok main jane tak kii buddha kii yah sadhana katha dur nidaan ke antargat he
 547 Jataka stories are related to this second diagnosis of Buddha biography from Apanaka Jataka to Vesantara Jataka
 in kathaon se yahan taatpary he inamen varnit atitvatthu
 They are related to the short diagnosis of the life story of Buddha i
e
 these are the stories of the past
 lumbini van main janm lene ke samay se lekar bodhi-prapti tak kii katha avidure nidaan se sambandhit he
 That is, she is not so far away from the past
 bodhi prapti se lekar nirvana prapti tak kii buddha jeevani santike nidaan ke antargat he
 That is, she is near
 jataka kii pacchuppannavatthu main iske kuch ansh prastaavna rup main aate hai
 The stories of the Jataka include the stories of his past births contained within the second diagnosis of Buddha biography in the past
 aitihaasik buddha ke jivan kii kisi ghatana kaa ullekh kar in duure nidaan kii kathaon ke kehane ke liye avkaash nikaal liya gaya he
 Whatever it is actually creates the native
 prayek jataka ke paanch angon ke uparyukt vivechan se spasht he ki jataka gadhy-padya mishrit rachanaayen hai
 The saga part is considered to be the oldest part of the native
 tripitak ke antarbhoot is gaatha bhaag ko hi maananaa adhik upyukt hoga
 The rest is fiction
 parantu jataka-kathaon kii prakruti aisi he ki mul ko vyakhya se alag kar dene par kuch bhi samaj main nahin aa saktaa
 Only the stories do not create the story
 unke upar jab vartmaan or ateet kii ghatnaon ko dhaanchaa chadhaaya jaataa he tabhi kathavstu kaa nirmaan hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to have the above five elements in the whole Jataka, in which all except the saga-part is its explanation, the latter is added
 phir bhi suvidha ke liye or aitihaasik drushti se galat dhang par ham uskon jataka kah dete hai
 In fact, the collection of 547 Jataka tales which are coordinated with the above mentioned five organs, we should not say Jatakattvavana or Jatakathakatha, rather than Jataka
 phosbal or kowal ne jiskaa kramshah roman lipi main or angreji main sampaadan or anuwaad kiya he yaa hindi main bhadant anand kausalyayan ne ‘jataka’ sheershak se 6 bhaagon main anuvaa da kiya he, vah vastav main jataka na hokar jataka kii vyakhya he
 The Jataka tales are basically only gathas, the rest is its interpretation
 gaatha or jataka ke shesh bhaag kaa kalkram aadi kii drushti se kya parsparik sambandh he yah prashn saamne aata he
 In the legend, the story has been called Abhinambabuddha saga or stories sung by Lord Buddha
 ve buddhavachan hai
 Therefore, she was a part of Tipitak and compiled from there, a structure of stories has been presented on her
 sampoorn jataka granth kii vishaywastu kaa jis aadhaar par vargeekaran hua he, usase bhi yahi spasht he ki gaatha-bhaag, yaa jise pinternitj aadi vidwaanon ne gaatha-jataka kaha he, vahiin uskaa muladhar he
 The classification of the Jataka text is based on the number of gathas and not on the basis of subject matter
 ther-theri gaathaon ke samaan vah bhi nipaton main vibhakt he
 The native has 22 falls
 pehle nipaat main 150 aisi kathaayen he jinamein ek kii ek gaatha pai jaati he
 There are 150 Jataka stories in the second fall, but two stories are found in each story
 isi prakaar tisare or chauthe nipaat main pachaas-pachaas kathaayen he or gaathaon kii sankhya kramshah teen-teen or chaar-chaar he
 Further, the same sequence often continues till the thirteenth fall
 chaudaaven nipaat kaa naam pakinnak nipaat he
 The number of gathas in this fall is varied from 14 to not according to the rules
 isliye iskaa naam pakinnak rakh diya gaya he
 10 stories are also found in some stories in this nipati and up to 47 in some stories
 aage ke nipaton main gaathaon kii sankhya nirantar badhati gai he
 The title of the fifteenth ninth is Vis Nispat, Tis Nispat of the sixteenth, forty-nine Nishat of the seventeenth, Panas Nishat of the eighteenth, Sixty Nishat of the nineteenth, Sattinipat of the twentieth and Assinipatam of the twenty-seventh
 bisen nipaat main keval das jataka kathaayen he kintu prayek main gaathaon kii sankhya sau se bhi upar he
 The number of gathas in the last person is above seven hundred
 in sabase yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki jataka kathaon kii aadhaar gaathaayen hi he
 In the interpreting part of many Jataka stories themselves, the distinction between Pali and Atthakatha is shown, as in many other books of Pali Sutras and also in the texts of Visuddhimagga
 jahaan tak jataka ke veyyakaran bhaag se sambandh he, vahaan pali kaa arth tipitak gat gaatha hi ho saktaa he
 From the evidence of language, the saga part is more ancient than the prose section
 pinternitj ne kaha he jataka kii sampoorn gaathaon ko tipitak kaa mul ansh nahin mana ja saktaa he
 There is also a distinction between them
 swayan jataka ke vargeekaran se hi yah spasht he
 In the fourteenth fall, the number of stories of each Jataka tale is not very much 14 as per the rules - somewhere is very high
 isi prakaar biswein nipaat main uski do jataka kathaon kii sankhya sattar-sattar na hokar kramshah 92 or 93 he
 It has been concluded that the original number of the Jatakas or the saga of the Jatakas will be the same as the number of the title of Nipat
 or baad main uskaa sanvardhan kiya gaya he
 So some of the saga is more ancient and some is relatively less ancient
 isi prakaar gadhy bhaag bhi kuch atyant pracheenta ke lakshan liye hue he or kuch apekshaakrit arvachin he
 There is no resemblance between prose and saga part in some people and there is a lot of variation in the style anywhere
 is sabase jataka ke sankalanaatmak rup or uske bhashaaroop kii vividhta par prakaash padataa he jisamen kai rachayitaaon yaa sankalankartaaon or kai shatabdiyon kaa yoga rahaa he
 The antiquity of the Jataka stories is undeniable, most of its prose is also very ancient
 bharhut or sanchi ke stupon kii pashaan veshtoniyon par jo chitra ankit he ve jataka ke gadhy bhaag se hi sambandhit hai
 Therefore, most of the prose part of Jataka which is ancient, in the third, second century BCE must be so popular that it can be made the basis of craftsmanship
 atah saamanytah ham jataka ko buddhakalin bhartiya samaaj or samskruti kaa pratik maan sakate hai
 Some of the signs and stages depicted in it are also from prague-buddhist India and some are from the post-buddha era
 jahaan tak gaathaon kii vyakhya or unke shabdaarth kaa samb ndh he, vah sambhavtah jataka kaa sab se adhik arvachin ansh he
 The author of this excerpt is considered Acharya Buddha Ghosh
 ‘gandhavans’ ke anusaar acharya buddhaghosh ne hi ‘jatakatthannana’ kii rachana kii, kintu yah sandigdh he
 While showing a variation of language style and giving some other prohibitive reasons, Dr
 T
 W
 Royce Davids does not consider Buddhaghosha to be the author or compiler of the Jatakattavavana
 swayan jatakatthakatha ke upodghaat main lekhak ne apana parichay dete hue kaha he ‘‘ xxrep 4 
 shantchitt pandit buddhamitt bhikshu buddhadev ke kehane se xxrep 8 
 vyakhya karunga
 The Mahishasak sect was a Buddhist sect unlike the Mahavihara tradition
 buddhaghosh ne jitani atthakathaayen likhi he, shuddh mahaviharavasi bhikshuon kii upadesh vidhi par aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, it is not right to associate the author of the scripture with Acharya Buddhaghosh
 sambhavtah yah koi anya sinhalai bhikshu the, jinka kaal paanchavin shatabdi isvi mana ja saktaa he
 It contains the following stories: tripitak The Jataka tales relate to the past births of Lord Buddha
 bodhisattva kii charyaaon kaa unamem varnan he
 So, they are all usually didactic
 parantu unka saahitiyik rup bhi nikharaa hua he
 Despite being didactic, he is artistic in its entire sense
 jataka ke aadi main nidaan-katha he, jisame bhagavan buddha ke pehle 24 budhon ke vivaran ke saath-saath bhagwaan gautam buddha kii jeevani letvan vihaar ke daan kii sweekruti tak di gai he
 The summary of some Jataka tales and the form of their subject matter is as follows

 Jataka tales form folk-literature
 usamen pashu-pakshiyon aadi kii kathaayen bhi he or manushyon kii bhi he
 The plot of the natives is of various types
 vinternitj ne mukhyatah saat bhaagon main unka vargeekaran kiya he- The styles of description also vary
 vinternitj ne inkaa vargeekaran paanch bhaagon main is prakaar kiya he
 Vanarind Jataka, Villarwat Jataka, Sihachamm Jataka, Sunsumar Jataka, and Sandhibdha Jataka etc
 jataka kathaayen pashu-kathaayen he
 These stories are very important
 visheshtah inhen kathaon kaa gaman videshon main hua he
 The cast of satire is also seen here in its poetic form
 praayah pashuon kii tulana main manushyon ko hin dikhaaya gaya he
 One special thing is that satire has been done on the entire caste and not on any person
 ek bandar kuch dinon ke liye manushyon ke bich aakar rahaa
 Later turns to his teammates
 saathi poochhate he-‘‘manushyon ke samaaj main rahe he
 They know their behavior
 hamen bhi kahen
 We want to hear that
 ‘‘ manushyon kii kerani mujhase mat pucho
 Say, we want to listen
 bandar ne kahana shuru kiya,‘‘ hiranya meraa! sona meraa! yahi raat din ve chillaate he
 Two people live in the house
 ek ko munch nahin hoti

 use bahut dhan se kharida jaataa he
 He hurts all the people
 ‘‘ bandar kah hi rahaa tha ki uske saathiyon ne kaan band kar liye‘‘ mat kahen mat kahen‘‘
 Many pictures of this kind of melodious and unique satire will be found in the native

 In Mahapingal Jataka, in relation to the popularity of Brahmins, in Sigal Jataka, in relation to a very intelligent ascetic, Avariya is in Jataka

 Its place in Buddhist literature is well accepted
 sthaviravaad ke samaan mahayan main bhi uski prabhoot mahatta he, yadhyapi uske rup ke sambandh main kuch thodaa bahut parivartan he
 Like Buddhist literature, the Jataka has an important place in the overall Indian literature and not only that, in the whole world literature
 isi prakaar bhartiya sabhyataa ke ek yug kaa hi vah nidarshak nahin he, balki uske prasar kii ek adbhoot gaatha bhi jataka main samaaye hue hai

 cheenk aane ko apshakun maanate the or jab koi cheenkta tha to usase log kehete the ‘jeeyo’ yaa ‘chinrajiv hoo’
 People believed in true action
 mugapakh jataka main ham dekhte he ki kashiraj kii rani ne satya kriya ke bal se santaan praapt kii
 Similarly in the Battak Jataka it is said that a quail's child extinguished the fire in the tree with his true action force
 vayah praapt kumarikaon ko apana var khojane kii swatantrata thi, aisa amb jataka se pataa chalata he
 In Sankich Jataka, the wife is called Dhankita
 isse pataa chalata he ki kuch vishesh avasthaaon main pati ko kanya ke pita ko dhan bhi dena padataa tha
 Uday Jataka seems to do the same
 jahaan tak dharmik avasthaa kaa sambandh he, ek prakaar kaa lok-dharm prachlit tha
 People worshiped Yakshas, trees, serpents, Garuda and rivers
 ek stri ko jo apane pati se vichhud gai he, ham bhagirathi ganga kii stuti karte or uski sharan main jate dekhte hai
 But it is not right to conclude from this that one type of Bhagat Vat Dharma was prevalent among the people
 gokuldaas de ne is baat ko dikhaane kaa bada prayaas kiya he, ki dharm kaa jo swaroop jatakakaleen samaaj main ham dekhte hai usamen bhagwat dharm ke tatv vidyaman hai
 a type of folk religion was prevalent in Jataka society
 jisamen saadhaaran jan-samaaj ke vishwaas or uski vibhinn loukik or aadhyatmik aavashyaktaayen samtal par pratibimbit thi
 That is, feelings of worship, worship, charity, refuge of gods etc
 were predominant
 jataka vastutah pracheen bhartiya saamaajik jivan sambandhi soochnaaon kaa agaadh bhandar hi hai or unka samagratya adhyayan pali sahitya ke itihaas lekhak ke liye sambhav nahin he
 This is the subject of many great texts
 buddha dharm ke sabhi sampradaayon main jataka kaa mahatv supratishthit he
 It is a link connecting Mahayana and Hinayana, because the Bodhisattva ideal of Mahayana exists here in its seed-form
 duusari-teesri shatabdi isvi purv ke sanchi or bharhut ke stupon main jataka ke anek drishy ankit he
 Many Jataka tales have been quoted in Milindphan
 amravati stupa dwitiya shatabdi isvi main uske chitra ankit he
 In the fifth century, 500 scenes were recorded in Lanka
 ajanta kii chitrakaari main bhi mahis jataka ankit he
 Many pictures of him are also written in Bodh Gaya
 java ke borobdur stupa 9veen shatabdi isvi main barma ke pagaan nagar main sthit pegodaon main or siam main sukhoday naamak pracheen nagar main jataka ke anek drishy chitrit mili hai
 Therefore, the importance of Jataka is not only in India, outside India also Stalism is not only important in Buddhism but also in many other forms of Buddhism
 kalkram kii drushti se vaidic sahitya kii shunagashep kii katha yama-yami samvaad, pururava urvashi samvaad aadi kathanak hi buddha purv kaal ke ho sakate he
 Some of the Upanishads, such as Chhandogya and Brihadaranyaka, may also be considered to be pre-buddha times, and similarly some narratives of Aitareya and Shatapatha Brahmana may also be considered to be pre-buddha
 inkaa bhi jaatakon se or saamanytah pali sahitya se ghanishtha sambandh he
 The Tavija Sutta mentions the names of these ten mantra sages as well as Aitareya Brahmana, Taittiriya Brahmana, Chandogya Brahmana and Chhanda Brahmana, along with the names of Atakka, Vamak, Vamdev, Vishvamitra, Yamadagni, Andighara, Bharadwaja, Vasistha, Kashyapa and Bhrigu
 majjhim nikaay ke assalaayan suttant ke aashwaalayan brahman ko prashn upanishad ke aashvalyan se milaayaa gaya he
 The Mjjim is the resident of the Sravasti Sravasti of the body and crosses into the veda-veda
 isi prakaar prashn upanishad ke aashwalayan bhi veda veda rghain ke mahapandit he or kausalya he
 Many signs of close contact with Vedic literature are also found among the natives
 uddalak jataka main uddalak ke takshashila jane or vahaan ek lok vishrut acharya kii soochna paane kaa ullekh he
 Similarly, in Setuketu Jataka there is mention of Uddālaka's son तुvetuketu to go to Taxila to study arts
 shatapath brahman ke uddalak ko ham uttarapath main bhraman karte hue dekhte he
 Therefore, it is not inconsistent to conclude from this that the Uddālakas of the Jātakas and ्वेvetuketu Brahmins are not different from the persons of these names in the texts and Upanishads
 german vidwaan luders ne sethuketu jataka main aane vaali gaathaon ko vaidic aakhyaan or mahakavy yugin kavy ko milaane vaali kadi kaha he, jo samuchit hi he
 Similarly, Sinhalese scholar Malalasekar says that the Jataka is related to the narrative genre of Indian literature from which the later epics have developed
 ramayana or mahabharat ke saath jataka kii tulana karte samay hamen yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki in donon granthon ke sabhi ansh buddha purv yug ke nahin he
 There are 2400 verses in the present form of Ramayana
 ramayana main kaha bhi gaya he ‘chaturvinsh sahatrani shlokanam ukt van rishih
 But Buddhist scripture proves that even in the second century AD, there were only 12,000 verses in the Ramayana
 ramayana 2-109-34 main buddha tathagat kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Similarly, there is a description of conflict with Shaka, Yavan etc
 kiskindha kand main sugriv ke dwaara kuru madra or himalay ke bich main yawanon ou r shakon ke desh or nagaron ko sthit bataaya gaya he
 This proves that at the time when the passages were written, the Greeks and Scythians had established their suzerainty over some regions of Punjab
 atah ramayana ke kaaphi ansh maharaj bimbisar yaa buddha ke kaal ke baad likhe gayi
 There is a clear mention of educations in Maha Bharat
 buddha visheshan chaaturmahaaraajik bhi vahaan aayaa he
 There is also a description of the Romans
 isi prakaar sithian or greek aadi logon kaa bhi varnan he
 In the Adi festival, Maharaja Ashoka has been called Mahasur and has been praised as Mahavirooparajitha
 shaanti parv main vishnugupt kautilya ke shishy kaamandak kaa bhi arthvidya ke acharya ke rup main ullekh he
 Thus it is proved on the basis of many evidences that a considerable part of the present form of Mahabharata is from the later era of Buddha Ashoka and Kautilya Vishnugupta
 jataka kii anek gaathaon or ramayana ke shlokon main adbhut samanta he
 In Dasaratha Jataka and Devadhamma Jataka we often get the complete outline of rama-katha
 jayddis jataka main ram kaa dandakarany janaa dikhaaya gaya he
 Similarly, the resemblance of Sama Jataka is from Ramayana 2
 63-25 and in the opinion of Vinternitz the description of Jataka is more simple and preliminary
 vessantar jataka ke prakruti varnan kaa samya isi prakaar valmiki ke prakruti varnan se he or is jataka kii katha ke saath ram kii katha main bhi kaaphi sadrushta he
 Many scholars have compared Jataka with Mahabharata
 unke nishkarshon ko yahan sankshiptatam rup main bhi rakhana vastav main bada kathin he
 The Janak is the Janak Upanishads of the Jataka and the Brahminical Janak of Mahabharata
 mithila ke prasaadon ko jalte dekhakar janak ne kaha tha mithilaayaan pradiptayan na main dahyati kinchan
 Exactly the same statement is found in Mahajanaka Jataka and also in Kumbhakara Jataka and Sonak Jataka
 atah donon vyakti ek he
 Similarly, the entire story of Rishyashrighain is in Nakinika Jataka
 yudhisthir or vidura kaa samvaad das brahman jataka main he
 There is a story of Krishna and Draupadi in Kunal Jataka
 isi prakaar ghat jataka main krishna dwaara kansa-vadh or dwarka basaane kaa puraa varnan he
 The Mahakana Jataka Nimi Jataka and Mahanaradkasap Jataka describe King Ushinar and his son Shivi
 civi jataka main bhi raja shivi kii daan parmita kaa varnan he, apni aankhon ko de dene ke rup main
 So the story is basically Buddhist, no doubt
 mahabharat main 100 brahmadatton kaa ullekh he
 Probably Brahmadatta was the common adjective of kings, not the name of a single king, which was adopted by 100 kings
 dummedh jataka main bhi raja or uske kumaar donon kaa naam brahmadatt bataaya gaya he
 Similarly in Gangmal Jataka it is said that Brahmadatta is the name of the clan
 suseem jataka, kummaspind jataka, atthan jataka, lomaskassap jataka aadi jaatakon kii bhi, yahi sthiti he
 Therefore, Brahmadatta who came among the natives is not synonymous with only one time
 unamem kuch na kuch aitihaasikta bhi avashya he
 In addition to Ramayana and Mahabharata, Jataka stories are also mentioned in the great language of Patanjali
 pracheen jan sahitya main or baad ke katha-sahitya par bhi uskaa prabhaav uplakshith he
 In the first century AD, Gunadhya wrote his vadkaha in Paisachi Prakrit which is not available today

 It was translated into Arabic in the eighth century under the title Kalela Damna
 ‘ kalela damana’ shabd ‘karkat’ or ‘damanak’ ke arabi roopaantar hai
 In the fifteenth century the Arabic translation of the Panchatantra was translated into German, then gradually transformed into all European languages
 vastav main sidhe rup se bhi jataka ne videshi sahitya ko prabhavit kiya he or uski katha bhi atyant pracheen he
 The stories of Isop are famous in Greek literature

 The stories of Aesop have had a major influence on European literature, and it has been shown by scholars that the majority of Aesop's stories are based on the Jataka
 sihachamm jataka kii katha ati prasiddh he jo isap kii kahaniyon main bhi pai jaati he
 a donkey with a lion's skin is visible in both these places
 dow0 tii0 dablyoo0 rais davids kaa mat he ki shakespeare ne apane naatak king jonh main is katha kii ore sanket kiya he- ank-2, drishy-1 tathaa ank 3 drishy 1 main

 This is a wonderful but historically true thing
 dow0 tii0 dablyoo0 rais davids ne shakespeare ke marchent ov venice main teen dibiyon tathaa adhser maance ke varnan main tathaa age you like it main bahumoolya ratnon ke vivaran main jataka ke prabhaav ko dhund nikaala he evam slevonic jati ke sahitya main tathaa praayah sabhi purvi europe ke sahitya main jataka ke prabhaav kii vidyamanata dikhaai he
 The monk Sheelabhadra has proved by giving sufficient examples that Nimi Jataka is the basis of the famous work of the fourteenth century Italian poet Dante
 german vidwaan benfe ne jataka ko vishwa ko katha sahitya kaa udgam kaha he jo tathyon ke prakaash main atishyokti nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Thus, the place of Jataka is important in the history of literature and civilization of the world along with Indian literature and culture
 misr ke 27 bade prashasnic kshetreey vibhaag hai jinhen muhafazah kehete hai, yani kisi rajyapal kii hifaazat yaa nigaraanee main rakhaa gaya kshetra
 Their status is almost like the provinces of India
 misr ke muhaafazaat yaa to shahari hote hai yaa phir shahari-dehati kaa mishran hote hai
 The urban-rustic mixed idiom is divided into areas called 'markaz'
 yah vahi shabd he jiskaa matlab hindi-urdu main 'kendra' hota he lekin misr kii arabi upbhasha main iskaa arth 'gaanvon kaa samooh' he
 There are no villages in a completely urban enclave, so they are not divided even in Maracz
 2011-2012 kaal main misr ke muhaafazaat kaa byoraa kuch is prakaar he: Mesotartaric acid is an organic compound
 2017-18 vijay hajaare trophy ko vijay hajaare trophy ke 16 wein satr kaa aayojan karnaa he, jo ki bharat main list e cricket toornament he

 kusamah main bharat ke bihar rajya ke antargat purnia mandal ke arriya jile kaa ek gaanv he
 CERN Courier is a monthly trade magazine publishing news and events related to cern's high energy physics community
 mulya vardhit kar, yaa vastu or seva kar ek upbhog kar he, kisi bhi mulya par jo ek utpaada main jodi jaati he
 VAT, unlike sales tax, is neutral with respect to the number of routes between the producer and the end consumer; Where sales tax is levied on the total price at each stage, the result is a step
 waite ek apratyaksh kar he, is rup main ki kar ko aise kisi se ekatra kiya jaataa he jo kar kaa puraa kharch nahin uthaata
 Maurice Louré, the joint director of the French tax authority, Direction générale des impôts was the first to introduce VAT on 10 April 1954, although the concept was proposed in 1918 by German industrialist Dr
 Wilhelm von Siemens
 shuru main bade paimaane ke kaarobaaron par lakshyit, samay ke saath sabhi vyavsaayik kshetron ko shaamil karne ke liye iskaa vistaar kiya gaya
 In France, it is the most important source of finance for the country, contributing 52% of the country's revenue
 utpaadon or sevaaon ke nijee antim upabhokta, kharid par waite ko vasuul nahin sakate, lekin udyog un maal or sevaaon par jinhen ve aage kii aapurti yaa seva pradaan karne ke liye kharidte hai, jise sidhe yaa paroksh rup se antim upyogkarta ko bechaa jayega, waite ko vasuul sakate hai
 In this way, the total tax levied at each level in the economic chain of supply is a constant fraction of the value that a business adds to its products and much of the cost of tax collection is borne by the business rather than the state
 waite kaa avishkaar isliye kiya gaya kyonki bahut adhik bikri karon or shulkon ne dhokhadhadi or taskari ko protsaahit kiya
 Critics say this leads to an inconsistent tax burden on middle-class and low-income households
 mulya yojit kar, utpaadan ke har charan main yojit mulya par kar laga kar bikri kar ke sopan asar se bachaata he
 Value-added taxation is being preferred worldwide instead of the traditional sales tax
 siddhant rup main, mulya yojit kar un sabhi vanijyik gatividhiyon par lagu hote hai jisamen maal kaa utpaadan or vitaran tathaa sevaaon kaa praavdhaan shaamil hota he
 In each transaction of a business, VAT is evaluated and collected on the value added to the goods
 is avadharana ke tahat sarkaar ko prayek lenden ke sakal margin par kar diya jaataa he
 In many developing countries like India, sales tax / VAT is an important revenue source as high unemployment and low per capita income make other income sources inadequate
 haalanki, kai up-rashtriya sarkaron dwaara iskaa virodh hota he chunki isse unke dwaara ekatrit kul rajasav sangrah main kami hoti he saath hi saath swaittata kaa kuch nuksaan bhi hota he
 Sales taxes are usually levied only on final sales to consumers: because of reimbursement, VAT has the same overall economic impact on final prices
 mukhya antar, sirf atirikt lekhankan kaa he jise un logon dwaara karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo aapurti shrinkhalaa ke bich main aate hai, waite kii is kami ko, utpaadan shrinkhalaa ke prayek sadsy par, unki or graahakon kii is shrinkhalaa main sthiti ko dhyaan naa dekar or unki sthiti kii jaanch karne or pramanit karne ke prayaas ko khatm kar, samaan kar ke prayog dwaara santulit kiya jaataa he
 When there is some exemption in the VAT system, if any, as with GST in New Zealand, it becomes even easier to pay VAT
 ek saamaanya aarthik vichaar yah he ki yadi bikri kar 10% se adhik ho jaataa he to log bade paimaane par karapavanchan gatividhiyon main lipt ho jate hai 
 The total VAT rate, on the other hand, may exceed 10% without extensive evasion due to innovative collection systems
 tathaapi, kyonki apane sangrah kii vishesh vyavastha ke kaaran, waite kaaphi aasaani se vishisht dhokhadhadi kaa nishaanaa ban jaati he jaise carozal frod jo rajyon ke liye kar aamadani main kami ke maamle main bahut mahangaa ho saktaa he
 The standard method for applying VAT is the principle that a business retains a percentage of the product minus the price previously paid
 yadi waite dar 10% he, to ek santare kaa ras nirmaataa prati galen keemat £5 ke 10% ko santare ke kisaan dwaara purv main bhugtan kiye gaye kar se gata kar degaa 
 In this example, the orange juice producer would have a £ 0
30 tax liability
 prayek vyavsaay ke aapurtikartaaon ke liye apane karon kaa bhugtan karne ke liye ek majboot protsaahan hota he, jisase ek khudara bikri kar kii tulana main waite dar, kam kar chori ke saath oonchi ho jaati he
 Behind this simple principle are variations in its implementation, as discussed in the next section
 sangrah kii paddati se, waite lekha aadhaarit yaa bijak aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Under the invoice method of collection, each seller imposes a VAT rate on their product and gives the buyer a special invoice indicating the amount of tax levied
 kharidaar jo apni bikri par waite ke daayre main hai, in bijkon kaa prayog waite kii apni dendaree ke prati ek credit praapt karne ke liye karte hai
 The difference between the tax shown on the invoice passed and the invoice received is then passed on to the government
 lekha aadhaarit tareeke main, aisa koi vishesh bijak prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Instead, the tax is calculated at the value added, which is measured as a difference between revenue and allowable purchases
 adhikansh deshon main aaj bijak vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, ekmaatr apwaad he japan jahaan lekha paddati kaa upyog karata he
 By the time of collection, VAT can be either accrual or cash based
 nakad aadhaarit lekhankan, lekhankan kaa ek bahut hi saral rup he
 When a payment is received for the sale of an item or service, an accumulation is made and the revenue is recorded at the date of receipt of the funds - no matter when the sale was made
 check tab likhe jate hai jab bill dene ke liye dhan uplabdh ho or vyay ko check kii taarikh main darj kiya jaataa he - isaki bina parvaah kiye ki kharch kab kiya gaya
 The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank and the secondary focus is on ensuring that all bills have been paid
 rajasav ko us samay avadhi ke saath jab unhen arjeet kiya gaya, tulana karne main adhik prayaas nahin kiya jaataa, yaa kharchon ko us avadhi se milan karne main jab unhen vyay kiya gaya
 Accrual based accounting matches the revenue from the period when they were earned and the expenses for the period when they were incurred
 haalanki yah nakadi aadhaarit lekhankan se zyada jatil he, yah aapke vyavsaay ke bare main adhik jaankaree pradaan karata he
 The accrual basis enables you to track receivables and payables
 prodbhavan aadhaar aapako unhen kamaane main kiye gaye vyay ke liye rajasav ke milan main madad karata he, aapako or adhik sarthak vittiya report detaa he
 Consider the manufacture and sale of any item, which we would call a widget in this case
 ek 10% bikri kar ke saath: Hence the consumer paid 10% extra as compared to the zero tax scheme and the government collected this amount
 khudara vikreta ne tex main sidhe kuch nahin khoyaa or khudara vikritaon ko atirikt kagaji karrwai kerani hoti he taaki unke dwaara ikattha kiye gaye bikri kar ko sahi dhang se sarkaar tak pahunchaaya ja sake
 Suppliers and manufacturers have the administrative burden of supplying the right certificate and checking that their customers are not consumers
 10% waite ke saath: That is, the consumer paid 10% extra as compared to the zero tax scheme and the government collected this amount in taxation
 kaarobaar ne kar main sidhe kuch nahin khoyaa
 They do not require a request for a certificate from buyers who are not end users, but they will have to do additional accounting so that they can correctly differentiate between the government, what they collected from VAT and what they spent in VAT
 Can give dhyaan den ki prayek maamle main pradutt waite, laabh yaa yojit mulya ke 10% ke baraabar he
 The advantage of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that the industry cannot hide consumption, proving that it is not a consumer
 uparokt udhaaharan main, hamane mana ki kar kii shuruuaat se pehle or baad main vijet kii utani hi sankhya main nirmaan hua or bikri hui
 This is not true in real life
 aapurti or maang ke mul tatv sujhaate hai ki koi bhi kar kisi ke liye lenden kii keemat ko badha detaa he, chaahe vah kreta ho yaa vikreta
 keemat main badhotaree se yaa to maang vakr baayi taraf jaataa he, yaa aapurti vakr upar kii taraf
 donon hi kaaryaatmak rup se baraabar hai
 As a result, the quantity of goods purchased decreases and / or the price it is sold increases
 upar ke udhaaharan main aapurti or maang kaa yah badlaav shaamil nahin he, saralata ke liye or kyonki ye prabhaav har prakaar kii vastu ke liye bhinn hai
 The above example assumes that the tax is non-distortable
 baaki sabhi karon kii tarah, ek waite, iske bina hota, ise viroopit karata he
 Because the price for someone increases, the quantity of goods decreases
 tadnusaar, kuch log adhik dwaara badtar ho jate hai jahaan sarkaar kar kii aay se behatar ho jaati he
 That is, the supply and demand change leads to a far greater loss than the tax benefits
 ise dedwet haani ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Income lost by the economy is higher than government income; Tax is disabled
 sarkaar kii aay kii puri raashi ho saktaa he ek dedwet draig naa ho, agar kar rajasav ko laabhadaayak kharch ke liye istemaal kiya jaay yaa sakaaratmak bahyata ho - duusare shabdon main, sarkarein bas kar aay kaa upbhog karne kii bajaay kahin adhik kuch kar saktin hai
 While distortions occur, consumption taxes, such as VAT, are often considered better because they distort incentives to investment, saving and working less than most other forms of taxation - in other words, rather than producing a VAT Discourages consumption
 upar chitra main, The "value added tax" has been criticized since its burden depends on consumers of personal end products and is therefore a regressive tax, although it should be understood that all company taxes ultimately arrive as a tax on consumers
 bachaav pakshon kaa daawa he ki aay ke madhyam se karadhaan ko nikaal dena ek manamaana maanak he or mulya yojit kar vastav main ek anupatik kar he or isamen adhik aamadani vaale log adhik bhugtan karte hai usee dar par jis par ve khapat adhik karte hai
 Both measurements make VAT more regressive than making it a progressive income tax
 ek waite pranali kaa prabhavi pratigaami gun, bad bhi saktaa he kyonki maal ke vibhinn virgon par alag-alag daron se kar lagaae jate hai
 Therefore VAT is mostly a flat tax and in practice can be regressive
 ek mulya yojit kar se praapt rajasav aksar apeksha se kam hote hai kyonki ve kathin hai or unka prabandhan or sangrah karnaa mahangaa hota he
 In many countries, where collection of personal income tax and corporate profit tax has historically been weak, VAT collection has been more successful than other taxes
 waite kai kshetradhikaron main or adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he chunki vyapaar udaarikaran ke kaaran tarriff str duniya bhar main gira he or anivaary rup se waite ne khoye hue tarriff rajasav ko pratisthapit kiya he
 The distortion of cost and value-added tax is less than the high import duty of economic inefficiencies and enforcement issues, it is disputed, but by principle value-added taxes are far more effective
 kuch udyogon main waite kaa adhik parihaar paaya jaataa he, vishesh rup se jahaan nakad lenden prabal hota he or ise badhaava dene ke liye waite kii aalochana kii ja sakati he
 From the government's point of view, however, VAT may be better because it can hold at least some value additions
