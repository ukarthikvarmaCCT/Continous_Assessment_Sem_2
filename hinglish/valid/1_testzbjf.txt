 Sir Isaac Newton was a scientist from England
 jinhone gurutvkarshan kaa niyam or gati ke siddhant kii khoj kii
 He was a great mathematician, physicist, astrologer and philosopher
 inkaa shodh prapatr "prakritik darshan ke ganitiya siddhanton "" san 1687 main prakashit hua, jisamen saarvatrik gurtvakarshan evam gati ke niyamon kii vyakhya kii gai thi or is prakaar chirsmmat bhautikee kii neenv rakhi
 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus
 unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa bhi pradarshan kiya or ek falan ke shunyon ke sanniktan ke liye tathakthith "newton kii vidhi" kaa vikaas kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa ke adhyayan main yogadan diya
 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today
 ijac newton kaa janm 4 janvari 1643 ko puraani style or nai style kii tithiyaan |OS]]: 25 disambar 1642]linkolanshir ke county main ek hemelet, woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth main woolsthrope menor main hua
 At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted a Grigorian calendar and so the date of his birth was recorded as Christmas Day 25 December 1642
 newton kaa janm unke pita kii mrityu ke teen maah baad hua, ve ek samrudh kisaan the unka naam bhi ijac newton tha
 He was a small child born in a pre-mature state; His mother Hannah Ayscuff said that he could fit a small mug like a quart
 jab newton teen varsh ke the, unki maa ne dubaara shaadi kar lee or apane nae pati reverand barnabus smith ke saath rahane chali gai or apane putr ko uski nani margeri askf kii dekhbhaal main chod diya
chota ijac apane sautele pita ko pasand nahin karata tha or uske saath shaadi karne ke kaaran apni maa ke saath dushmani kaa bhav rakhata tha
 As reflected in the list of crimes committed by him until he was 19 years old: "I threatened to burn the house of mother and father Smith
" baarah varsh se satraa varsh kii aayu tak unhone di kings skool, grantham main shiksha praapt kii unhen skool se nikaal diya gaya or oktober 1659 ve woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth aa gaye, jahaan unki maan, jo duusari baar vidhwaa ho chuki thi, ne unhen kisaan banane par jor diya
 He hated farming
 kings skool ke master henry stokes ne unki maa se kaha ki ve unhen phir se skool bhej den taaki ve apni shiksha ko puraa kar saken
 Inspired by his desire for revenge against a schoolboy, he became a top-ranked student
 june 1661 main, unhen trinity college, cambridge main ek sijar-ek prakaar kii kaary-adhyayan bhoomika, ke rup main bhartee kiya gaya
 The teachings of the college at that time were based on Aristotle
 lekin newton adhik aadhunik darshanikon jaise descartes or khagolavidon jaise kopernicus, galileo or kepler ke vichaaron ko padhnaa chahta tha
 In 1665 he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory later known as the Altaipal calculus
 agast 1665 main jaise hi newton ne apni degree praapt kii, uske thik baad plig kii bheeshan mahamari se bachane ke liye ehtiyaat ke rup main vishvavidhyalay ko band kar diya
yadhyapi ve ek cambridge vidhyaarthee ke rup main pratishthit nahin the, iske baad ke do varshon tak unhone woolsthorpe main apane ghar par nijee adhyayan kiya or kalan, prakaashiki or gurutvkarshan ke niyamon par apane siddhanton kaa vikaas kiya
 In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of Trinity
 adhikansh aadhunik itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki newton or libanij ne atyalp kalan kaa vikaas apane apane adwitiya sanketanon kaa upyog karte hue swatantra rup se kiya
 According to Newton's inner circle, Newton developed his method many years before Leibniz, but he did not publish any of his works until about 1693 and did not give a complete account of his work until 1704
 Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684
 In addition, Leibniz's notations and "methods of differentiation" were universally adopted on the continent and, after 1820, were also adopted in the British Empire
 jabaki libanij kii pustikaayen praarambhik avasthaaon se paripakvata tak vichaaron ke aadhunikeekaran ko darshaati hai, newton ke gyaat nots main keval antim parinaam hi he
 Newton said that he did not want to publish his calculus because he was afraid he would become a character of ridicule
 newton kaa swiss ganitagya nicholas fatiyo de duiliar ke saath bahut kareebi rishta tha, jo prarambh se hi newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant se bahut prabhavit the
 In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never completed it
 However, the relationship between these two men changed in 1693
 is samay, duiliar ne bhi libanij ke saath kai patron kaa aadan pradaan kiya tha
 In early 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the controversy was fully revealed in 1711
 newton kii royal socity ne ek adhyayan dwaara ghoshnaa kii ki newton hi sachche avishkaarak the or libanij ne dhokhadhadi kii thi
 The study came under suspicion when it was later found that Newton himself wrote commentary on the study's conclusion on Leibniz
 is prakaar kadava newton banaam libanij vivaad shuru ho gaya, jo baad main newton or libanij donon ke jivan main 1716 main libanij kii mrityu tak jari rahaa
 Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, which is valid for any power
 unhone newton kii sarvasamikaon, newton kii vidhi, vargeekrut ghan samtal vakr kii khoj kii, parimit antaron ke siddhant main mahatvapurn yogadan diya, ve pehle vyakti the jinhone bhinnaatmak suchakank kaa prayog kiya or diophentin samikarnon ke hal ko vyutpann karne ke liye nirdeshaank jyamiti kaa upyog kiya
 He approximated the partial sum of the harmonic series by logarithms, and was the first to use the power series with confidence and the power of the power series
 unhen 1669 main ganit kaa leukesian professor chunaa gaya
 In those days, any member of Cambridge or Oxford was required to be a designated English priest
 haalaanki, leukesian professor ke liye jaruri tha ki vah carch main sakriy na ho
 Newton argued that he should be exempt from the need for coordination, and Charles II, whose permission was mandatory, accepted this argument
 is prakaar se newton ke dharmik vichaaron or angreji rudhiwaadiyon ke bich sangharsh tal gaya
 From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics
 During this period he discovered refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism dissects white light into a spectrum of colors, and a lens and a second prism combine white spectrum to form white light
 unhone yah bhi dikhaaya ki rangeen prakaash ko alag karne or bhinn vastuon par chamakaane se ragin prakaash ke gunon main koi parivartan nahin aata he
 Newton described that whether it is reflected, or radiated or transmitted, it remains of the same color
 is prakaar se, unhone dekha ki, rang pehle se rangeen prakaash ke saath vastu kii antarkriya kaa parinaam hota he naaki vasteen khud rangon ko utpann karti hai
 This is known as Newton's color theory
 is kaary se unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki, kisi bhi apvarti doordarshee kaa lens prakaash ke rangon main visaran kaa anubhav karegaa or is avadharana ko siddh karne ke liye unhone abhidrishyak ke rup main ek darpan kaa upyog karte hue, ek doordarshee kaa nirmaan kiya, taaki is samasya ko hal kiya ja sake
 darasal dizin ke nirmaan ke anusaar, pehla gyaat kriyaatmak paravarti doordarshee, aaj ek neutonian doorabeen ke rup main janaa jaataa he, isamen takanic ko aakaar dena tathaa ek upyukt darpan padaarth kii samasya ko hal karnaa shaamil he
 Newton based his mirror on a custom outfit of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to test the quality of optics for his telescope
 farvari 1669 tak ve rangeen vipathan ke bina ek upkaran kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 In 1671 the Royal Society asked him to demonstrate his reflecting telescope
 un logon kii ruchi ne unhen apni tippaniyon on color ke prakaashan hetu protsaahit kiya, jise baad main unhone apni optics ke rup main vistrut kar diya
 When Robert Hooke criticized some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he dropped out of public debate
 hook kii mrityu tak donon dushman bane rahe
 Newton argued that light is made up of particles or superfluous particles, which refract as they pass through the dense medium, but it was necessary to correlate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light
 
 baad main bhautikavidon ne prakaash ke vivartan ke liye shuddh tarang jaise spashtikaran kaa samarthan kiya
 Today's quantum mechanics, the idea of photons and wave-particle coupling, bear little resemblance to Newton's understanding of light
 1675 kii unki prakaash kii pariklpana main newton ne kanon ke bich bal ke sthaanantaran hetu, ether kii upasthiti ko manjuur kiya
 His interest in alchemy revived after coming into contact with the theologian Henry More
 unhone ether ko kanon ke bich aakarshan or pratikarshan ke vayuruddh vichaaron par aadhaarit gupt balon se pratisthapit kar diya
 jon menard kenez, jinhone rasayan vidya par newton ke kai lekhon ko sweekaar kiya, kehete hai ki "newton kaaran ke yug ke pehle vyakti nahin the: ve jaaduugaron main aakhri number par the
 "newton's interest in alchemy cannot be distinguished from his contributions to science
 yadi unhone ek nirvaat main se hokar ek duuri par kriya ke gupt vichaar par bharosa nahin kiya hota to ve gurutv kaa apana siddhant viksit nahin kar pate
 In 1704 Newton published Optics, in which he explained in detail his theory of microscopic particles of light
 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe
 1677 main, newton ne phir se yantriki par apana kaary shuru kiya, arthath, gurutvkarshan or grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon ke sandarbh ke saath, grahon kii kaksha par gurutvkarshan kaa prabhaav or is vishay par hook or flemustid kaa paraamarsh
 He published his results at the De Motu Corporum in Jiram
 isamen gati ke niyamon kii shuruyaat thi jisane princepia ko suchit kiya
 The Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published on 5 July 1687 with the financial help and encouragement of Edmund Healy
 is kaary main newton ne gati ke teen saarvbhaumik niyam die jinamein 200 se bhi adhik varshon tak koi sudhaar nahin kiya gaya he
 He used the Latin word gravitas to that effect known as gravitation and defined the law of universal gravitation
 isi kaary main unhone vaayu main dhwani kii gati ke, boil ke niyam par aadhaarit pehle vishleshatmak pramaan ko prastut kiya
 He was criticized for Newton's concept of an invisible force that could operate over vast distances, as he merged "secret agencies" into science
 princepia ke saath, newton ko antarrashtriya khyaati mili
 unhen kaaphi prashansaaen milin, unke ek prashansak the, switzraland main janme nicholas fatiyo de dayulir, jinke saath unka ek gaharaa rishta ban gaya, jo 1693 main tab samaapt hua jab newton tantrika avrodh se peedit ho gaye
 In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious researches related to literary interpretation of the Bible
 henry mor ke brahmad main vishwaas or kartiya dwaitvaad ke liye asweekruti ne shaayad newton ke dharmik vichaaron ko prabhavit kiya
 He sent a manuscript to John Locke in which he disputed the existence of the Trinity, which was never published
 baad ke kaary – di kronology of encyent kingdems amended or obsarvations apon di prophysij of danniel and di apocalips of saint jon – kaa prakaashan unki mrityu ke baad hua
 He also devoted much of his time to alchemy

 lekin kuch vivaranon ke anusaar unki tippaniyan hameshaa koshth main ek thande sookhe ko lekar hi hoti thim or ve khidki ko band karne kaa anurodh karte the
 In 1696 Newton moved to London to assume the post of warden of the royal mint, a position he gained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, the first Earl of Halifax, the then Chancellor of the Treasury
 unhone england kaa pramukh mudra dhallaai kaa kaary sambhaal liya, kisi tarah master lucas ke ishaaron par naachne lage Lucan's death in 1699 became Newton perhaps the best-known master of the mint, a position Newton held until his death
 These appointments were taken as an irresponsible position, but Newton took him seriously, from his Cambridge duties in 1701 Retired and tried to improve the currency and punished the clippings and fake currency makers using their power
 1717 main taksaal ke master ke rup main "laa of queen ene" main newton ne anjaane main sone ke paksh main chaandi ke paise or sone ke sikke ke bich dwi dhatvik sambandh sthapit karte hue, pound sterling ko chaandi ke maanak se sone ke maanak main badal diya
 For this reason silver sterling coins were melted and shipped out of Britain
 newton ko 1703 main royal socity kaa adhyaksh or french acadmic des sciensej kaa ek sahyogi bana diya gaya
 While in his position in the Royal Society, Newton turned hostile to the astronomer John Flemsteed, he prematurely published Flemsteed's Historica Colestis Britannica, which Newton had used in his studies
 april 1705 main queen eni ne newton ko trinity college, cambridge main ek shahi yatra ke dauraan nite kii oopaadhi di
 This knight's title was not conferred upon Newton for his services as master of the mint nor for his scientific work, but for his political contributions during the parliamentary election in May 1705
 
 newton kii mrityu landan main 31 march 1727 ko hui, or unhen westminster ebbe main dafnaaya gaya tha
 His half-niece, Catherine Barton Conduite, served as her hostess in social affairs at her house in Germain Street in London; He was her "very loving Uncle", which is mentioned in her letter written to her by Newton when she was recovering from smallpox
 newton, jinke koi bachche nahin the, unke antim varshon main unke rishtdaaron ne unki adhikansh sampatti par adhikaar kar liya or nirvasiyat hi unki mrityu ho gai

 Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects may be different

 For example, the second law also applies to planets and a falling stone
 duusare niyam kii sadish prakruti bal kii disha or vastu ke samveg main parivartan ke prakaar ke bich ek jyamitiya sambandh sthapit karti he
 Before Newton, it was generally believed that for a planet rotating around the Sun, a forward force was required which caused it to move
 newton ne darshaya ki is ke bajaay surya kaa andar kii or ek aakarshan bal aavashyak hota he
 Even several decades after the publication of the Principia, this idea was not universally accepted

 Newton himself often told a story that upon seeing a falling apple from a tree, he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity
 baad main vyangy karne ke liye aise cartoon banaaye gaye jinamein seb ko newton ke sar par girte hue bataaya gaya or yah darshaya gaya ki isi ke prabhaav ne kisi tarah se newton ko gurutv ke bal se parichit karaayaa
 unki pustikaon se gyaat hua ki 1660 ke antim samay main newton kaa yah vichaar tha ki sthaliy gurutv kaa vistaar hota he, yah chandramaa ke varg vyutkramanupati hota he; haalaanki purna siddhant ko viksit karne main unhen do dashak kaa samay laga
 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation
 ek samakaleen lekhak, wiliam stukele, sar ijac newton kii zindagi ko apane samaran main ricord karte hai, ve 15 april 1726 ko kencinghton main newton ke saath hui baatcheet ko yaad karte hai, jab newton ne zikr kiya ki "unke dimag main gurutv kaa vichaar pehle kab aayaa
 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth
 " isi prakaar ke shabdon main, volter mahakavy kavita par niabandh main likhaa, "sar ijac newton kaa apane baganon main gum rahe the, ped se girte hue ek seb ko dekh kar, unhone gurutvkarshan kii pranali ke bare main pehali baar sochaa
 The various trees are claimed to be "that" apple tree which Newton has described
 di kings skool, grantham daawa karata he ki yah ped skool ke dwaara kharid liya gaya tha, kuch saalon baad ise jad sahit laakar pradhanadhyaapak ke bageeche main laga diya gaya
 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked

 unke kul main bhi sanskrit kaa hi prachaar tha
 The servants also spoke Sanskrit
 unke kul main bhi sanskrit chhod hindi bhashaa main kavita karnaa unhen kuch apmanjanak-sa laga - Keshav was a very emotional and jovial person
 kaha jaataa ki ek baar vrudhdavastha main ve kisi kuen par baithe the
 Some women who came to fill the water addressed him as Baba
 is par unhone nimna doha kaha - Around the year 1608, Jahangir gave the kingdom of Orchha to Vir Singh Dev
 keshav kuch samay tak vir singh ke darbar main rahe, phir gangatat par chale gaye or vahiin rahane lage
 He died in 1618 AD
 keshavadas rachit pramanik granth nau hai : rasikapriya, kavipriya, nakhsikh, chandmala, ramchandrika, veerasinghdev charit, ratanbavanee, vigyaangita or jahangir jaschandrika
 Rasikapriya is an adult work by Keshav, which is a poetry book
 isamen ras, vritti or kavyadosha ke lakshan udhaaharan die gaye hai
 Its main foundation texts are Natyashastra, Kamasutra and Rudrabhatta's Shringaratilak
 kavipriya kavyashiksha sambandhi granth he jo indrajeetsingh kii rakshita or keshav kii shishyaa pravinrai ke liye prastut kiya gaya tha
 It is based on choice and poetry
 ramchandrika unka sarvaadhik prasiddh mahakavy he jisaki rachana main prasanraghav, hanumannatak, kadambari aadi kai grantho se saamagi grahan kii gai hai
 In Ratanbavani, Yatoghan is the son of Madhukarshah, Ratansen, Anuj Veerasingh and Jahangir Jaschandrika of Indrajit Singh in Veerasingh Charit

 Keshav Alankar was a sectarian poet
 isaliye swaabhaavik tha ki ve bhamah, udbhat or dandi aadi alankaar sampradaay ke aacharyon kaa anusaran karte
 He considered two distinctions of ornaments, ordinary and specific
 saadhaaran ke antargat varnan, varnya, bhumishri-varnan or rajyashri-varnan aate he jo kavyakalpaltavriti or alankarishekhar par aadhaarit hai
 In this way they do not distinguish between rhetoric and ornamentation
 alankaaron ke prati vishesh ruchi hone ke kaaran kavyapaksh dab gaya he or saamanyat: ye sahruday kavi nahin maane jate
 They have been called the phantom of difficult poetry due to their attrition
 vishisht prabandhkavy ramchandrika prabadhanirvaah, maarmik sthalon kii pahchaan, prakrutivarnan aadi kii drushti se shreshth nahin he
 There is a glut of narratives due to tradition and incorporating more and more embellishments
 chahal-pahal, nagarshobha, saajasja aadi ke varnan main inkaa man adhik rama he
 In the planning of dialogues, they have achieved particular success due to the incorporation of dramatic elements
 prabandhon kii apeksha muktakon main inaki saralata adhik sthalon par vyakt hui he
 Keshav was a court poet
 anya darbari kaviyon kii bhaanti unhone bhi apane ashrayadata raajaaon kaa yashogaan kiya he
 Veer Singh Dev Charit and Jahangir Jas Chandrika are his similar compositions

 In kavi-priya and rasik-priya, he translated Sanskrit traits, texts and wrote his poems as an example
 ram chandrika kaa vishay ram-bhakthi he kintu keshav kavi pehle the, bhakt baad main
 Therefore, they have more of a performance of poetic-miracle than devotion
 vigyaan gita main keshav ne vairaygy se sambandhit bhaawanaaon ko vyakt kiya he
 Keshav did not remain in nature due to being in the decoration of the courts
 unka prakruti-chithran dosha-purna he
 There is more of the ruthlessness of tradition, less of originality and novelty
 varnan karne main kahin-kahin keshav ne kaal or sthaan kaa bhi dhyaan nahin rakhaa he
 Nature, burdened with ornaments, has lost its enduring beauty
 prakruti ke sambandh main keshav kii kalpanaaen kahin-kahin par badi asangat or aruchikar ho gai hai
 To make Arun Surya a blood-filled skull of Kapalika period would seem like a test
 darbari kavi hone ke kaaran keshav main rajdarbaron kii vakpatutaa vartmaan thi
 Hence, he had exceptional success in the planning of dialogues
 unke samvaad atyant aakarshak hai
 They have the same sentiment and courtesy as the courts
 unke dwaara charitron kaa uddhatan sundar dhang se hua he
 janaka-vishwamitra dialogues, luv-kusha dialogues, sita-hanuman dialogues are similar dialogues
 'angad-ravan-samvaad' ke antargat ek uttar-pratyuttar dekhie - Ravana- angad- Acharya Keshavdas was a great scholar
 atah unke kavy main kalpana or mastishk ko yoga adhik he
 His attention was not as much about erudition-performance
 paanditya-pradarshan kii isi pravriti ke kaaran kuch aalochakon ne keshav ko hriday-hin kavi kaha he, kintu yah aarope purnatah satya nahin, kyonki paanditya pradarshan ke saath-saath keshav ke kavy main aise anekanek sthal hai jahaan unki bhavukta or sahrudayatapurna saakaar ho uthi he
 In Ashoka Vatika, Hanuman ji gives Ramchandra ji's ring to Sita ji
 mudrika ke prati sita ji kaa kathan kitna bhavpurn he- Keshava made Brajbhasha the medium of his poetry, but the molded form of Brajbhasha found in poets of Sura etc
 Ashta Imprint is not in the poetry of Keshava
 keshav sanskrit ke prakand pandit the, atah unki bhashaa sanskrit se atyadhik prabhavit he
 He has adopted not only the corresponding words of Sanskrit, but also the variations of Sanskrit, in some places the language of his verses seems to be Sanskrit- keshav kii bhashaa main bundelkhandi bhashaa kaa bhi kaafii mishran miltaa he
 Bundeli words like Kharak, Thorilla, Dugai, Gaurmadine etc
 were used in his poetry
 avadhi bhashaa ke shabdon kaa bhi prayog miltaa he
 Such as here, here, show, show, etc
 keshav ne kahin-kahin to shabdon ko garh liya he
 Like - arc to arc
 aprachlit shabdon ke prayog main bhi unhone puri tarah svachhndatha se kaam liya
 Such as - light, launch, woman etc
 jal ke arth main vish shabd kaa prayog keshav kii bhashaa main hi miltaa he - Due to the immense influence of Sanskrit and Bundelkhandi, the use of obsolete words, long word-planning, etc
, Keshava's language has come to some degree of special illusion
 keshav kii bhashaa kaa saamaanya rup apekshaakrit sugam he
 Sayings and idioms have also been used in this place
 laaj maranaa kahawat kaa ek prayog dekhie - The impression of his personality on Keshav's style is clearly visible in this regard, he did not follow any of his former poets
 anek kaviyon kii kavitaaon ke bich unki kavita ko saralata se pahichaana ja saktaa he
 In short, Keshav's style is mature and serious
 paanditya-pradarshan ke kaaran vah kuch duruh ho gai he
 Keshav Das ji has given a great eulogy to various juices at many places in his poetry, but mainly he is a poet of Shringar and Veer Ras
 shringaar ke donon pakshon ko unhone apanaaya he
 They do not keep their touch in the poignant description of heroic enthusiasm
 shatrughna ke baanon se moorchhit lav ke liye vilaap karti hui sita ke prati kush kaa kathan kitna utsaahpurn he _ Keshav's knowledge of the verses was immense
 jitne prakaar ke chhandon kaa prayog unhone kiya hindi sahitya main kisi ne nahin kiya
 In Ramachandrika, the variety of verses has reached such a extent that scholars have called it a museum of words
 keshav ne swatah likhaa he - Keshav's verses plan is the verses plan of Sanskrit literature
 unhone kavita, savaiya, doha aadi chhandon kaa bhi safaltaapurvak upyog kiya he
 According to Keshav, he had a special love for ornaments - atah unki kavita main vibhinn alankaaron kaa prayog sarvatra dikhaai detaa he
 Poetry expressions have been overwhelmed by the burden of embellishments and the reader feels only a miracle
 jahaan alankaar-yojana prati keshav ko kathor aagrah nahin he, vahaan unki kavita atyant hridaygrahi or saras hai
 See an example of upma-ornamentation - After dasharatha-maran, when Bharat enters the palace, he finds the mothers like trees without creepers
 keshav dasji hindi sahitya ke pratham acharya hai
 In Hindi, he was the first to discuss various parts of poetry in the classical method
 yah thik he ki unke kavy main bhav paksh kii apeksha kala paksh kii pradhanta he or paanditya pradarshan ke kaaran unhen kathin kavy ke pret kah kar pukaara jaataa he kintu unka mahatv bilkul samaapt nahin ho jaataa
 In the words of Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, in the composition of Keshava, even if the simplicity and tenacity of the tone, basil etc
 were not there, but by giving a detailed introduction to the Kavyangas, he opened the way for further
 keshavadas ji vastutah ek shreshth kavi the

 The word Bishnupriya is probably derived from Bishnupur, with the suffix -ya, which means "the people of Bishnupur"
 Bishnupriya Manipuri holds that the language was passed to Manipur by some immigrants from Dwarka and Hastinapura soon after the Mahabharata war
 
 aage yah kaha gaya he ki in apravasiyon kaa netritv chitrarangada or arjuna ke putr babruvahan or tritiy pandav ne kiya tha
 Some scholars and history writers have supported the ancient Manipur origin of the Mahabharata period of Bishnupriya Manipuri by observing the morphology, vibronic, and phonology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language
 Bishnupriya Manipuri believes that his language is strongly influenced by Sanskrit and Maharashtra as well as Sauraseni nature

 Pranayama is one of the eight organs of yoga
 pranayam = praan + aayam
 It literally means 'to prolong life' or 'to prolong life'
 hathyogpradipika main kaha gaya he- It is also said- pranayam do shabdon ke yoga se bana he- pehla shabd "praan" he doosraa "aayam"
 The meaning of Prana which gives us strength or strength
 aayam kaa arth jaanane ke liye iskaa sandhi viched karnaa hoga kyonki yah do shabdon ke yoga se bana he
 It has the root word "yam" and "A" prefix
 yam kaa arth 'gaman hota he or '"aa" ' upsarg 'ulataa ' ke arth main prayog kiya gaya he arthath aayam kaa arth ulataa gaman hota he
 Therefore, in Pranayama, the dimension has been used in the sense of 'inverse movement'
 is prakaar pranayam kaa arth 'praan kaa ulataa gaman hota he
 It is to be noted here that pranayama is the noun of the particular action of movement, not the result
 arthath pranayam shabd se praan ke vishesh kriya kaa bodh hona chaiye
 Many sages have said about Pranayama in their own way but all have the same feeling like Pranayajam Sutra of Patanjali and Pranayam Sutra of Gitanjali in which Pranayam Sutra is considered important which is as follows- Tasmin sati breathing breathing belief Its Hindi translation will be like this- Pranayama is the separation of the speed of breathing
 is sutara ke anusaar pranayam karne ke liye sabase pehle sutara kii samyak vyakhya honi chaiye lekin patanjali ke pranayam sutara kii vyakhya karne se pehle hame is baat kaa dhyaan dena chaiye ki patanjali ne yoga kii kriyaaon evam upaayen ko yogasutra naamak pustak main sutara rup se sankalit kiya he or sutara kaa arth hi hota he -ek nishchit niyam jo ganitiya evam vigyaan sammat ho
 If the formula is not explained correctly, the answer is far from true and the result will be zero
 yadi patanjali ke pranayam sutara ke anusaar pranayam karnaa he to sabase pehle unke pranayam sutara tasmin sati shwasaprashwasayorgativiched:pranayam
 kii samyak vyakhya honi chaiye jo shastranusaar, vigyaan sammat, taarkik, evam ganitiya ho
 Action has to be done according to this interpretation
 iske liye sutara main prayukt shabdon kaa arthbodh hona chaiye tathaa usamen di gayi gati viched kii vishesh yukti ko jaananaa hoga
 For this, the words used in the Pranayama Sutra of Patanjali should be understood
 shwaas ko dhimi gati se gahari khinchakar rokna va baahar nikaalnaa pranayam ke kram main aata he
 With breathing, feel that the life force, superiority is being drawn in by breathing, while exhaling feel that our bad, vicious feelings, bad thoughts are coming out with exasperation
 ham saans lete he to sirf hawa nahin khichate to uske saath brahmand kii sari urja ko usame khinchate he
 Now you will feel how it will happen just by breathing
 ham jo saans fefdo main khichate he, wo sirf saans nahin rahati usame saare bramhand kii sari urja samaayi rahati he
 Believe that the breath that makes your whole body move, it also has the power to repair your body

 We have to rectify our mistakes, one we do not breathe fully; And secondly our breath goes to the stomach
 dekhiye hamaare sharir main do raste he, ek or doosraa | jaise fefdo main hawa shuddh karne kii pranali he, vaise pet main nahin he
 Due to this, there is a lack of oxygen in our body and due to that, diseases are added to our body

 Kapalbhati Pranayama is called the life of earth
 kapaalbhaati pranayam karte samay muladhar chakra par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hota he
 By this, the Kundalini Shakti helps in awakening the Muladhar Chakra
 kapaalbhaati pranayam karte samay aisa sochna he ki, hamaare sharir ke saare nakaaratmak tatv sharir se baahar ja rahe hai
 You may not get food but at least 5 minutes of Kapalbhati Pranayam is to be done daily, this is to be strong

 After exhaling the breath completely, after keeping the breath out, we apply three bonds
 1) jalandhar bandh :- gale ko puraa sicode kar thodi ko chaati se sata kar rakhana he
 2) Uradyan bandhan: - The stomach has to be pulled completely back inside
 3) mul bandh :- hamaari mel visarjan karne kii jagah ko puri tarah upar kii taraf kheenchna he

 And while breathing in the mind, one should keep on chanting
 hamaare sharir kii 72,72,10,210 sukshmaadi sookshm naadee shuddh ho jaati hai
 The left pulse is called the Chandra Nadi, and the left Nadi is called the Surya Nadi

 Our body temperature is balanced by the use of cold and hot air

 Others Others: Asharism or Ashari theology Arabic: الأشعرية al -'aas'yīyaya or الأشاعرة al-ashria) is the most prominent religious school in Sunni Islam, based on the guidelines of Islamic orthodoxy
 abu al-hasan al-ashaari dwaara sthapit he
 The disciples of this cult or school are known as Ashariyas, and the school is also known as the Ashari school, which became the dominant cult within Sunni Islam
 yah sunni islam main dharamshastra ke roodhiwaadee vidyalayon main se ek mana jaataa he, is ke saath mathuridi dharamshastra skool bhi ek prasidd skool mana jaataa he
 The most famous Asharites are al-behqi, al-nawawi, Al Ghazali, Is al-din ibn 'abd al-salam, al-suyuti, Ibn' Asakir, Ibn Hajar al-asqalani, al-qurtubi and al-subki
 abu al-hasan al-ashaari apane parmanuwaad ke liye prasidd hai, pehle islamic darshanikon main se ek ashari the jin ke drushtikon ke mutabik allaah har pal ko samay par or padaarth ke kanon se banaaya
 Nevertheless, he believed in free will
 daar ebn amr or abu hanipha ke vichaaron kaa vistaar bhi kiya
 While al-ashari opposed the idea of emphasizing the logic of the Mu'tazili school, he also opposed the idea which was not to be debated
 bahes karnaa man karne ke vichaaron vaale kuch skool jaise zahiri, mujassimai or muhaddithin, ashaari ne istihasaan al-khaud main in taqalid karne vaale skulon kaa virodh kiya he: Asharism became the main school of early Islamic philosophy, based on the foundation originally laid by Abu al-hasan al-ashari, who established the school based on the methodology taught by his teacher Abdullah ibn Sa'id ibn Kullab in the 10th century
 Had
 itihaas main is skool main kai badlaav hue jiske parinamswaroop aashaari shabd aadhunik upyog main behad vyapak tha, udhaaharan ke liye ebn favaraaq or al-behaaki ke bich matbhed
 The Asharia idea was that understanding of the unique nature and characteristics of Allah was beyond human capacity
 in samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye abu al-hasan al-ashaari dwaara prastaavit samaadhaan yah he ki quran main zikr kiye gaye allaah ke naamon kii tasbih or tathil karen
 Insofar as these names and characteristics are positive reality, they are distinct from essence, but still do not have existence or reality
 is maamle main al-ashaari kii prerana ek taraf saar tatwon or avadharanaon ko avadharanaon ke rup main alag karne ke liye thi, or duusari ore yah dekhne ke liye ki saar or gun ke bich ddhvand maatraatmak par nahin balki gunatmak str par sthit hona chahie - inhi baton main se kuch baton ko mutazili soch vaala skool samajhane main vifal rahaa tha
 These points are important in the Ashria or Ashria view: german orientlist adward sachau ne dasvin shatabdi main islamic vigyaan kii giravat ke liye vishesh rup se ashaari or uske sabase bade dephender al- gajali ke dharamshastra ko doshi tehraaya or kaha ki donon dharmik kii rukaawat kii vajah se muslim duniya "galileos, caplers or newton " nahin ban saki
 However, others argue that the Asharites not only accepted scientific methods but also promoted them
 jiyauddin sardaar bataate hai ki ebn al-hetham or abu rehaan al-biruni jaise mahanatam muslim vaigyanikon main se kuch vaigyanik paddati ke agrani the, ve islamic dharamshastra ke ashaari skool ke anuyaayi the
 Like other Asharites, who believed that faith or trouble should apply only to Islam, and not to any ancient Hellenistic authorities, Ibn al-haytham believes that the problem should be only that of the prophets of Islam, not any For other authority
 kuch lekhakon ne ashariyon or anya dwibhashi dharmavidon dwaara niojit charchaa vidhiyon ke aadhyatmik mulya par sawaal uthaaya he
 Fakhr al-din al-razi, himself a prominent figure in the Ashar school, said: "I employed all the methods that provided philosophy and dialectics, but in the end i realized that these methods were neither weary-hearted
 Can not bring solace nor quench thirst for thirst

 According to the census of India, this village is located in Tehsil Sambhal, District Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh
 sambandhit janaganana code: rajya code :09 jila code :135 tehsil code : 00721 Districts of Uttar Pradesh ghurnakshadarshi yaa ghurndarshi ek yukti he jo kisi vastu kii koniya sthiti ko maapne ke kaam aata he
 Its mechanism is based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum
 ghurndarshi kaa prayog jahaan chumbakeey sooyee kaam nahin karti vahaan bhi nevigation main hoti he 
 They are also more microscopic than magnetic dipping due to which they are used in intercontinental ballistic missiles and radio-controlled helicopters etc
 ghurndarshi yantric ho saktaa he or electranik bhi
 a mechanical rotator is a balanced wheel or wheel, which is installed in the base rings in such a way that it has three independent numbers
 is pahie ko ghurnak yaa roter bhi kehete hai
 This cycle is free to revolve around an axis or axis
 is aksh ko bhrami aksh kehete hai
 This axis or axis lies in one base ring at its horizontal diameter and this ring itself can also revolve around a horizontal axis in another outer ring
 yah aksh bhrami aksh ke samakonik hota he
 The outer ring also can rotate around a vertical axis
 is prakaar is chakra yaa ghurnak kii dhuree kisi bhi icchit disha main ingit karti hui rakhi ja sakati he
 This wheel exhibits two basic rotational qualities while lying: positional precession
 ghurndarshi ko bhalee bhanti samajhane ke liye in gunon ke lakshanon ko bhi samaj lenaa nitant aavashyak he
 According to Newton's First Movement, any body wants to remain in the state it lives in and exhibits a tendency to resist any change in that state
 is pravriti ko jadtv kehete hai
 Rotating on its axis, the rotor wants to revolve in its initial plane and oppose it by setting up a pulp
 ghurndarshi ke roter kii duusari visheshta he purassaran
 a fault is necessary to change the angular momentum of a body while revolving
 yadi baladhurna or koniya samveg ke aksh paraspar sampati hote hai, to us pind main ek koniya twaran utpann ho jaataa he, kintu us pind ke paribhraman kaa tal aparivartit rahata he
 Conversely, if the above two axes are mutually equilateral, there is no difference in the angular velocity of the body, but the plane of the rotation itself rotates
 is prakaar kii gati ko purassaran kehete hai
 The movements of the rotator is visible in all the rotating or rotating bodies, but in more angular momentum objects, these actions are more pronounced
 koniya samveg ke kaaran hi ghurnakshasthapi main dridhtaa tathaa jadtv ke gunon kaa samavesh hota he
 When a force is acting on a body, an angular momentum is generated around the axis of the force in that body, due to which the tendency of the body to rotate around that axis
 jitne samay tak vah balyugma kaary karata rahegaa utane samay tak us pind kaa koniya veg badhata hi jayega
 The following equation expresses the property of rotoscope- jahaan sadish τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau }}} tathaa l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} kramshah ghurnakshadarshi par aropit balaghurna tathaa koniya samveg hai
 Scalar i is its inertial, vector ω → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ omega}}} its angular velocity, and vector α → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ alpha}}} angular acceleration
 is sameekaran se spasht he ki yadi balaghurna τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau }}} ko ghurnan-aksh ke lambavat lagaaya jaay to iske kaaran τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau }}} tathaa l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} donon ke lambavat visthaapan utpann hoga
 This motion is called Purasaran
 purassaran kaa koniya veg ωsaanchaa:ind kaa vyanjak nimnlikhit hoga- Suppose, a heavy circle is rotating on a horizontal axis a-b
 dhuree ke donon siron par do bal f or f is prakaar kaary kar rahe hai ki unase ek balyugma kaa nirmaan hota he
 The force generated by it is g = Fl, where l is the length of the axis k-b
 iske parinamswaroop yah sampurna pranali ek anya lambik aksh ke chaaron ore purassruth hone lagegi
 If the velocity of rotation of the cycle is w and the rate of precession w ¢, then g = I
 w
 w ¢, where i is the inertial, around the nartan axis of that circle
 at: yadi chakra kaa koniya samveg i w kaaphi adhik hoga to w ¢ kaa maan bahut kam hoga
 It is clear that if a very inertial cycle is revolving very fast around an axis, then the effect of any external short-term force, G, on it will be extremely weak, ie it will be practically unaffected by disruptive external forces
 koniya samveg adhik ho is hetu kaaphi adhik vyasavaala gatipalak chakra ghurnakshasthapi main prayukt kiya jaataa he
 In addition, the angular momentum of the rotor can also be increased to a much greater extent by increasing the velocity w
 isse ghurnakshasthapi par kisi alpaayu bahya balyugma kaa prabhaav nahin pad saktaa
 Due to the above mentioned properties, the rotoscope can be used to demonstrate the rotation of the earth
 prithvi apni dhuree par pashchim se purv kii disha main paribhraman karti he
 One of its cruises is completed in 24 hours
 yadi kisi ghurnakshasthapi ko prithvi tal ke kisi sthaan par is prakaar rakhaa jaay ki uskaa bhoomi aksh purv pashchim disha main kshaitij rahe, to prithvi ke paribhraman ke saath saath uskaa sampurna dhaancha bhi prithvi ke centre kii parikrama karegaa, kyonki prayek samay us dhaanche kaa tal prithvi-tal ke lambavat rahegaa
 But due to its inertia and excessive angular momentum, the land axis will remain parallel to its initial direction
 isaliye prithvi ke paribhraman ke kaaran bhramiaksh, jo prarambh main prithvital ke samaantar tha, prati kshan kuch kone banaata hua dikhalaai padegaa
 Thus the axiom of the axillary will appear to be protruding around its right angular horizontal axis
 ghurndarshi kaa sarvapratham upyogi rup german ganigya johain buenburger ne prastut kiya tha
 In 1817 AD, he treated it very successfully in the experiments conducted in the course of his research research and after this, presented its details to the science world
 baad main lion phukon ne prithvi ke paribhraman ko pramanit karne ke hetu iskaa prayog kiya
 Although small or short-term forces or thrusts do not have any visible effect on the rotary, it does not produce the exact results as it should, in principle, due to friction between the brachimaries and the balberings
 iske liye aavashyak sanshodhan kar dene se etjjanit trutiyon kaa parihaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Some of the important practical uses of rotating eyeballs are: vayuyanon ke dishaniyantran ke liye ghurndarshi anivaary upkaran ban gaya he
 The compass rotates on the plane of the rotating aircraft in front of the driver
 apni praarambhik sthiti main isaki bhramidhuri prithvi tal ke thik samaantar rahati he
 There is a hole just in front of its cycle, through which a strong gust of incoming air keeps rotating the cycle very fast
 udate samay vayuyan ko jab ghumaya jaataa he tab ghurndarshi kii bhramidhuri apni praarambhik disha main rahati he
 That is why the rotation of the aircraft is known exactly

 Such a belief or idea is called illusion, despite the fact that there is no concrete evidence to be wrong, the person does not leave it
 yah us aasthaa se alag he jise vyakti galat soochna, agyaan, kattarpan aadi ke kaaran pakade rahata he
 According to this the definition of the word is - a belief that is a pathological condition
 vikrutivigyaan ke taur par dekha jaae to yah galat yaa apurna jaankaree, siddhant, morrkhtaa, atmachetana, bhram, yaa dharna ke anya prabhaavon se paidaa hone vaale vishwaas se bilkul alag he
 Especially during any neurological or mental illness, a person is prone to confusion
 vaise iskaa sambandh kisi vishesh rog se judaa nahin he, atah anek rogaatmak sthitiyon ke dauraan rogi ko bhram hone lagata he
 Mental disorders, especially dementia, paraphrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia seizures and delusions of mental depression are of particular clinical importance
 haalanki hazaron varshon se, paagalpan ke bare main tarah-tarah kii dharanaen maujuud hai, lekin manovaigyanik or darshanik karl jaspers pratham vyakti the jinhone 1917 main likhi apni pustak 'general saycopatholojee' main kisi vishwaas ko bhram ghoshit karne ke teen pramukh maandand bataaye hai
 These criteria are: ye maandand aaj bhi manorog ke aadhunik nidaan main lagu hote hai
 The definition given in the recently published 'diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' is: vaise is paribhaasha par vivaad he ki 'baaki sabhi logon ke vishwaas se hatakar hota he' kaa taatpary nikalataa hai ki yadi koi vyakti kisi aisi dharna par vishwaas karata he jis par baaki adhikansh log vishwaas nahin karte to vah vyakti bhramaatmak vichaar kii jakad main he
 Further, it is ironic that, while the above three criteria are attributed to Jaspers, he himself states that those criteria are 'vague' and only 'extraterritorial'
 unhone yah bhi likhaa he ki, chunki bhram kaa asli yaa 'aatanrik' 'maandand bhram ke praathmik anubhav or vyaktitv main hone vaale badlaav se janaa ja saktaa he, isliye bhram, bhram hote hue bhi, vishay ko lekar sahi ho saktaa he: jaise - vishwa yuddh ho rahaa he
 ' bhram ko, betuka yaa tark-sangat or manodasha-anuroop yaa manodasha-tatasth, in do virgon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 In addition to these classifications, illusions often correspond to a coherent subject
 haalanki bhram kisi bhi vishay main ho saktaa he, lekin kuch vishay hai jin par bhram hona aam baat he
 Commonly occurring delusions are: aadhunik paribhaasha or jaspers ke mul mandandon kii aalochana kii gai he, chunki har paribhaashit sthiti ke pratikul udhaaharan bhi paae ja sakate hai
 Studies on mentally ill patients show that over time, the intensity of delusions and the persistence of belief change, indicating that it is not necessarily certainty and impossibility to improve, Both are components of misleading assumptions
 yah zaruri nahin he ki bhram ek mithyaa ho yaa 'bahari satyata kaa galat anumaan'
 kuch dharmik or aadhyatmik manyataon ko apni sahajata ke kaaran jhuthlaayaa nahin ja saktaa or isiliye inhen asaty yaa galat bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, phir chaahe in manyataon par vishwaas karne vaala vyakti bhram kaa shikaar ho yaa na ho
 In other circumstances, confusion can be a true belief
 udhaaharan ke taur par, irshyaa kaa bhram, jisamen bhramit vyakti kaa maananaa hota he ki uskaa jivan saathi uske saath vishwasghaat kar rahaa he yaa rahi he, parinamswaroop, apane bhramit jivan saathi dwaara daale ja rahe nirantar or anuchit tanaav ke kaaran vafaadaar jivan saathi bewafaai karne par utaaru ho saktaa he
 In such a case, when the truth comes out later, confusion and confusion do not remain
 anya maamalon main, bhram kii jaanch karne vaale doctor yaa manochikitsak bhram ko galat bataa sakate hai, kyonki unhen lagata he ki aisi betuki yaa zarurat se zyaada vishwaas kii gai dharna asambhav he
 Psychiatrists have neither the time nor the means to examine the truth of the confused person's fact that the real belief has not been mistakenly given as an illusion
 Such a situation is called the Martha Mitchell Effect, which is associated with the name of a woman who was the wife of a lawyer who alleged that illegal activities were going on in the White House

 There are two major reasons for the 'origin of illusions': dopamine kii maatra bad jane se 'mastishk ke kaamkaaj main gadabadi' ke lakshan dikhaai dene lagate hai
 a primary study on psychotic syndrome examined whether an overdose of dopamine was necessary to maintain certain illusions, in fact this study was done to clarify whether dopamine psychosis was found in psychosis

 For example, delusions of criminality and punishment are often found among people in a Christian, Westernized country like Austria, but in Pakistan - where there is a high likelihood of crime, no delusions are found
 This is said to be a decisive influence of cultural components in the representation of illusions
 
 According to several studies, people in Austria also get caught up in the delusions of conviction and punishment, who are patients of Parkinson's disease and are being treated with i-dopa - artificial dopamine
