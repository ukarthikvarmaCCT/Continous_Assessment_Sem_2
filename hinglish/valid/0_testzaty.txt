 If memory resides in our brain, then there should be some evidence of its physical representation
 is disha main bahut saare shodh hue hai or iske sandarbh main bahut si vyakhyaayein bhi prastut kii gayi hai
 It was known from the beginning that only biological molecules are responsible for building memory
 sabase pehle 1960 ke dashak main DNA anuon ke vyutpann ke aadhaar par isaki vyakhya karne kii koshish kii gai
 It has been reported that mrna molecules are responsible for the biological representation of memory
 ullekhneey he ki ye mrna anu hamaare jini sandeshon or protein nirmaan ke liye mukhya rup se sambandhit hote hai
 In later years it was observed that this hypothesis of the physical basis of memory is not correct and new inventions are needed to present any idea in this field
 1970 ke dashak main smriti ke bhautik nirupan ke sambandh main kuch nae vichaar aae
 It has been reported that memory is generated in the brain in the form of weak electrical waves and it somehow makes permanent physical changes in the brain's structure at the microscopic level
 yah bhautik parivartan ek nai smriti ko nirupit karata he
 It would be notable for this interpretation that it was based on various experimental tests and was also correct
 lekin yahaan is baat kii vyakhya nahin ho paati thi ki “ksheen vaidyutiya tarange sanrachanaatmak rup se kaise or kya parivartan karti hai
 "in recent years, researches have yielded new information regarding Smriti Jowki
 inke anusaar smriti nirmaan main do pramukh kaarak tantrika rasayan or tantrika koshika ke synapse mukhya bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Researches have indicated that the neurotransmitters responsible for information convection in two nerve cells that are secreted by the synapses repeatedly stimulate a particular neural motif for a particular memory
 falswaroop ek pattern ban jaataa he
 Experiences and repeated attempts may change this pattern slightly
 kisi smriti vishesh ke liye yah pattern sthai hota he
 In other words, there are definite neural patterns for each of our experiences, art, skills, memory, etc
 jab ham kisi ke bare main sochate hai to usase sambandhit praaroop kaam kar rahaa hota he
 When we are solving a question, another format is activated
 ham sabhi ne kisi na kisi samay aisi sthiti kaa saamana kiya hoga jab ham apni yaadasht ko yaad karte hai
 For example, we are going to say something and suddenly forget what to say or all the answers of the question paper are coming in the exam but they are unable to find words to write
 yah smriti lop ke chote-chote udhaaharan hai
 On the other hand you may have noticed that some people complain of forgetting in old age
 ainstine ke bare main ek kahani prachlit he ki ek baar ve apane vishvavidhyalay main tahal rahe the tabhi unke ek vidhyaarthee ne unhen dopaher ke bhojan ke liye poocha
 Einstein asked him from which direction i was coming when you stopped me? The student pointed to one side and told that you were coming from that direction
 tab ainstin ne uttar diya
 Thank you! Then i have eaten food
 aisi bahut si kathaayen darshanikon or vaigyanikon ke sambandh main kahi jaati hai
 This is an example of a small-scale memory loss
 uparokt sabhi ghatnaon main ham dekhte hai ki kahin na kahin se hamaare mastishk kii sugam kriyasheeltaa main rukaawat ho rahi hoti he
 a small amount of memory defects occur in almost everyone but it cannot be named disease
 jab in lakshanon ke kaaran vyakti aurausase jude log prabhavit hone lage tabhi ise smritibhransh kaa naam dete hai
 These types of patients cannot remember the people they met only half an hour ago
 unhe yah bhi yaad nahin rahata ki das minute pehle unhone snaan kiya tha
 The normal actions of life are very badly affected
 smriti lop yaa smriti bhransh, smriti sambandhi ek aisi ghatana he jisamen isse sambandhit kisi bhi prakram jaise samaran yaa sangrahan main baadha utpann ho jaati he or jiske falswaroop hamaari saamaanya smriti prabhavit hoti he
 This obstruction can be caused by any physical or psychological cause such as brain injury or any other cause of damage, disease, nutritional deficiency, shock, excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse and age
 yahaan smritilop ke kuch mukhya prakaaron kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Symptoms are seen in people who consume excessive alcohol
 sharaab se lambey samay tak adhik maatra main seven karne se mukhyatah do samasyaayein hoti hai
 One is thiamine vitamin deficiency at dangerous levels and second, some harmful structural changes take place in the brain
 inke falswaroop rogiyon ki smriti buree tarah se prabhavit hoti he
 It is seen that their present-day memory is fine but they are unable to remember the past events and many important memories are completely missing from their memory
 is prakaar ke smriti bhransh main nai suchanaaen yaad karne main kathinaayee hoti he, lekin beeti ghatnaon kii smritiyaan bilkul thik hoti hai
 Such instances are seen that someone has been hurt on a particular part of the brain and after that only he can remember the old things and there is no space left for any new memory after the accident
 iske lakshanon main puraani ghatnaayen to ascharyajanak rup se bhul jaati hai lekin nai ghatnaon se sambandhit smritiyon main koi pareshaani nahin hoti
 Such instances are seen that after an accident, all the old memories are not known where? But there is no difficulty in remembering new information
 is prakaar ke smritilop main smriti kuch dinon main waapas aa jaati he
 It has been observed that sometimes our mind also inspires us to forget some special memories
 or ham unhen puri tarah se bhul bhi jate hai
 Such arrangements have been made by nature to make our present enjoyable
 aisa vishesh taur par bahut hi peedaadaayak smritiyon ke sandarbh main hota he
 For example, a tragic incident in childhood, punishment etc
 yahaan ullekhneey hoga ki ye smritiyaan keval hamaare chetan man se lupt hoti hai
 Somewhere in the deep unconscious, their parts are present
 ham apane aas-paas aise anek logon ko dekhte hai jinaki smriti kshamta bahut acchhee hoti he
 There are some people who are known for their forgetful nature
 ham main se sabhi sochate hai ki hamaari yaadasht kshamta batch jaae to kitna acha ho
 The main symptom of a good memory is that it arranges all related things in order and ensures their availability immediately when needed
 kuch aisi davaaiyaan uplabdh hai jinase gambhir rup se bhuulane kii sthiti main sahaayta milti he
 But these medicines should be used only in special conditions
 ham kitni acchhee tarah se yaad karte or sikhte hai yah kaaphi kuch hamaare bhaavnaatmak sthiti par nirbhar karata he
 An inspiring environment for learning and understanding is always beneficial
 ham tab bhi behatar tareeke se sikh pate hai jab ham dhyaan dete hai
 It is also necessary how the information is being coded
 iskaa bhandaaran or samekan kis prakaar ho rahaa he or iskaa punah samaran kaise ho rahaa he
 a good memory requires all these actions to go smoothly
 smriti yuktiyaan aisi vyavhaarik vidhiyaan hai jinase smriti kshamta ek had tak badhaai ja sakati he
 We also use them to remember some things unknowingly
 nepolian ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki use apni sena ke prayek adhikari kaa naam yaad tha
 People with such unique memory abilities appear to remember almanacs for many years
 ab yah prashn uthta he ki ek saamaanya vyakti ke yaad karne ke tareeke or vishisht smriti sampann logon ke tareekon main kya antar hota he? shodhon dwaara dekha gaya he ki alag-alag vyaktiyon main soochnaaon ke kodikaran, sangrahan or samaran kaa tarika thodaa alag ho saktaa he
 a good memory can either be an innate talent or can be learned later by ordinary people using some special methods
 janmajaat rup se ucch smriti kshamta vaale vyaktiyon main smritiyon kii prakriya thodi jatil hoti he
 It has been observed that some people also have symptoms of synesthesia
 sinesthesia ko samajhane ke liye kaha ja saktaa he ki aise log dhwani ko sunne ke saath saath dekhte or drishyon ko dekhne ke saath sunate bhi hai
 So they can use the visual capacity of the brain as well as the hearing capacity to see something
 udhaaharan ke liye ek komal madhur dhwani unke liye ek sundar rangon kaa samooh bhi ho saktaa he or ek kathor dhwani ke liye gahare tej chubte hue rang bhi ho sakate hai
 Symptoms of synesthesia may also occur for other sensory abilities such as touch, olfaction, etc
 smriti ko prabhaavshaalee banane ke liye anya bhi bahut sari smriti yuktiyaan prayog kii jaati hai
 Such as recalling already stored memory by adding new information, remembering the same information by putting it together, turning any information into an interesting story, etc
 jatil paathya saamagree ko samajhane ke liye ek or vidhi SQ3R bahut hi upyogi hoti he
 In this, we first prepare a blueprint of the textual content in mind, then make some questions based on "what, why and how" by itself
 ab in prashnon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue paathya saamagree ko dhyaan purvak padhaa jaataa he or phir use kram se dubaara padhate hai
 Finally it is reviewed by the reader
 acchhee smriti ke liye acha maansik or shaareerik swasthya jaruri he
 Along with this, emotional attachment to what is being read is also necessary
 kuch ekaagratha badhaane vaali vidhiyaan jaise ki dhyaan or pranayam aadi bhi smriti kii kshamta badhaane main bahut upyogi siddh hui hai

 The Mauser pistol was originally a semi-automatic pistol made in Germany, designed by two Mauser brothers from Germany - Wilhelm Mauser and Paul Mauser
 mouzar ke naam se hi is pistaul ko germany main 15 march 1895 ko petent karaayaa gaya tha
 The following year in 1896, a German ordnance manufacturer, Mauser, started manufacturing this pistol

 The company built this model until 1937
 baad main is pistaul ko spain or china main bhi banaaya jane laga lekin naam mouzar hi rahaa
 The biggest feature of this pistol was that it could be used separately like a rifle or shotgun by adding a large log of wood with its butt separately
 isse isaki maarak kshamta bad jaati thi
 Pistol was made smaller by separating this thread
 isaki duusari visheshta yah thi ki iske chambar main 6, 10 or 20 goliyon vaali choti yaa badi koi bhi magazine feet ho jaati thi

 is pistaul kii vaise to prabhavi maarak kshamta 150 se 200 meter tak kii hoti thi parantu yadi iske bat main kunda laga diya jaataa tha to yah 1000 meter tak prabhavi rup se maar kar sakati thi

 It was built under the name of Broomhandle

 a separating log could also be placed in it
 1896 se 1930 tak mouzar company ne ek lakh se adhik aisi pistaulen bechin
 Impressed by the popularity of this pistol, an Ordnance manufacturing company in Spain made another model similar to the C-96 in 1927 and named it - Astra Model 900

 Despite being a visionary and an idealist, he was the best, more realistic and accomplished political leader after Lincoln
 parantu 1913 main koi bhi yah nahin jaanata tha ki wilson mahaan vyakti banegaa
 No one knew that in spite of all efforts by Wilson for the United States not to participate in the First World War, that nation would have to take a decisive part in the war
 koi nahi jaanata tha ki vah atlantic ke us paar jaakar vishwa ko sthaayee shaanti dene kaa prayaas karegaa or uske praytn kuch europea raajnneetigyon kii swaarthparayanata or gharelu tuchh virodhon kii vedi par nasht honge
 No American president would have seen his own ideals and plans being mercilessly overthrown and defeated by his own people
 wilson raajnneeti shaastra kaa praadhyaapak tha
 Therefore, he was a thinker
 usne america prashasan par vishad granth likhe the
 His idea was that the sharing of power between the executive and the administration could not reconcile the governance
 atev uski ichha thi ki america raashtrapati ko england ke pradhanmantri kii bhaanti shaktishaalee hona chaiye
 When he became President, he undoubtedly implemented his ideas and made it a powerful focal point of President's rule

 He believed that satvik works will always triumph and that the representatives of truth should not compromise with untruths, indiscretions and hypocrisy

 vah adarshavaadi tha
 When he was elected President for the second time, he was deeply concerned that in view of the tense world situation, America could not be placed on the foot of neutrality
 wilson shaanti kaa samarthak tha
 He was well aware that the war of war would have a huge impact on the ideology, philosophy and literature of the Americans from the American state in the world war

 Wilson sent his famous message to the Congress on 2 April 1917, in which he advised his country to enter the war and protect the world democratic powers
 ukt sandesh main usne kaha, ”jin siddhanton ko ham hriday se chaahate hai, unki raksharth ham avashya ladege

 At that time in Europe, there was a feeling that Wilson is the only person who has risen above the rage and hatred of various nations and is the protector of humanity
 atah jab yah darshanik raja apane siddhanton kii pustika haath main lekar sainik-shakti se las, sandhi kii sharten nirdhaarit karne aayaa to europe kii janata ne uske sammaan main hriday khol diya
 It received unprecedented reception in all countries

 He was praised by a large crowd on the streets and the newspapers praised him
 vastav main sabhi kii ankhen uski ore lagi thim
 The victors hoped for justice, victories of mercy and common manpower
 wilson is sammelan main shaanti kaa deep banakar aayaa tha
 He did not want the Paris Conference to become a stronghold of vested interests like the Vienna Congress of 1815
 parantu vah andaaj nahin laga paaya tha ki vijeta rashtron main swaarth kii gandh rahati he or yadi vah anya tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhata to vah us jaal yaa dhokhe se batch jaataa jisamen vah swayan apane adarshavaad ke kaaran buree tarah ulajh gaya
 His sacred objectives were consumed in front of the conquering nations
 wilson ne apane vichaaron ko prasiddh 14 sutron ke rup main prastut kiya
 The first of its 14 sources was that peace agreements would be made publicly, there would be no secret agreement
 in siddhanton kii mitrarashtron ke raajnneetigyon ne bhi saraahna kii thi
 Apart from the above principles, what else did they have to solve post-war problems? And the defeated nations also agreed to these principles but nothing could be done in front of the ideals and principles in the power-loving nations
 is sammelan main bhi rashtravaadi vichaaron, vyaktigat swaarthon kaa bolbalaa rahaa, jinka vienna congress main praadhanya rahaa tha
 Both Clemensi of France and Lloyd of England succeeded in imposing their dogma on Wilson
 aar0bi0 mobaat ne ‘european diplomasi’ main likhaa he ki ”klemenso praatavkaal yah vaakya duharaaya karata tha- main rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa samarthan karuunga
 "but when Orlando of Italy was asked what is your opinion about the League of Nations, he replied that" We would undoubtedly welcome the establishment of the League of Nations, but the question of Fume should be fixed
 “ wilson sampoorn sammelan main akelaa pad gaya tha
 After the Vienna Congress, there was no such global conference in Europe on such a large scale
 princeton main raajnneeti-darshan kaa yah bhootpurv professor ek pratibhashali vaktaa tathaa adarshavaadi vichaarak tha
 He was a man of strong beliefs with a high degree of political foresight, but not so much diplomatic competence as to prepare other representatives for lenient dealings with defeated nations
 stennard baker ke shabdon main ”jis kisi ne bhi usko kaam karte dekha, uski kabhi himmat nahin hui ki vah wilson ke samaksh athwa uski peeth peeche ninda karne kaa saahas karata
 "wilson believed that mankind could be protected only by the establishment of the League of Nations, so he wanted to make it an indispensable part of all peace
 kintu vah maansik drushti se loyad jorge tathaa klemenso ke samaan kushagra nahin tha or apane purv-nirdhaarit vichaaron par vishesh rup se bharosa rakhata tha, atah vah kootneeti ke kshetra main or raajnneetik saudebaaji ke nausikhia siddh hua
 Other countries did not take full advantage of his idealism and excessive enthusiasm to establish a League of Nations 
 anya desh rashtrasang ke nirmaan kii baat maan len, iske liye wilson sab kuch tyaagane ke liye taiyaar tha, yahaan tak ki rashtrasang ke liye vah apane 14 sutron ke anek siddhanton kii avhelnaa karne ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gaya
 According to Paul Birdsall's statement, he was successful in getting most of his sayings in the name of the League from Britain, France and Japan on all other questions besides the problem of compensation
 chini janata dwaara baas hua shantung kaa pradesh wilson ke aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth ke aadhaar par china ko milanaa chaiye tha, kintu wilson ne rashtrasang kii sthapana ke liye anya mahashaktiyon kaa sahyog praapt karne kii ichha se ise japan ko dene kaa nirnay kiya
 This decision was a rebuff by Wilson himself
 phir bhi, paris-sammelan main yadi parajiton ke saath thodi narmi barti gai to vah wilson ke kaaran hi
 There was no doubt that if Wilson had not been in the conference, Lloyd George and Clemenso would have known what to do
 wilson hi unki aseem aakankshaon par ankush lagaataa rahaa
 If Wilson had not been there, France would have died by erasing Germany's nomination
 wilson ke do uddeshy the
 First just agreement according to which the boundaries of nations are determined on the principle of self-decision so that mutual peace can be established
 dwitiya, rashtrasang kii sthapana
 In the first objective, he did not succeed because the peace that was done was imposing peace and not on the basis of self-judgment or peace of negotiation
 parantu use duusare uddeshy main safalataa praapt hui
 The idea of a League of Nations was not original and many people contributed to clarify this idea in many countries, but the League of Nations that was finally founded was Wilson's creation and the temple of his ideals

 vaayu main dabaav hota he
 Generally we do not feel it
 yadi hamaare sharir ke kisi ang se vaayu nikaal lee jaae, tab vaayu ke dabaav kii anubhuti hamen saralata se ho jaati he
 The amount of air pressure at sea level is equal to 760 mm of mercury pressure
 jaise jaise ham vaayu main upar uthte hai, taise taise dabaav kam hota jaataa he
 Even the pressure on some mountain tops has been found to be up to 9 pounds per square inch
 vaayu ko dabaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Pressing increases its pressure
 aisi dabi hui vaayu kaa sampidit vaayu kehete hai
 This action of pressing is called 'compressing'
 sampeden se vaayu kaa aaytan kam ho jaataa he or dabaav bad jaataa he
 Thus air pressure can be raised very high
 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog aaj bahut adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 It is said to be happening in over two hundred works
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki do sau se adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 And it is increasing day by day
 iske upyog me koi khatra nahin he
 It can be easily transported to every location by machines
 isaki kuch mashine badi saral hai or kuch jatil bhi hai
 Compressed air can be used in two ways: by compressed air in machines, such air can be placed directly in the works, or compressed air can be stored in cylinders and stored in different works as required
 is
 sampidit vaayu praapt karne kii mashiinon ko vaayu sampidak kehete hai
 The simplest device for compressing the air is the air pump to fill the air in the bicycle or motorcar tubes
 par vaayu pump se adhik dabaav vaali sampidit vaayu nahin praapt ho sakati
 Complex air compressors are built for high pressure
 pehle pahal inkaa upyog sampidit vaayu dwaara chaalit drillon se pahaado ko katkar surang banane main hua tha
 They were also used in the rear rail brakes
 saamaanya vayusampidak se prati varg inch 60 se 100 pound kii dabaavvaali vaayu praapt hoti he
 Compressors are also made from which thousands of pounds of pressurized air can be obtained
 sampidak main silinder ke andar ek piston hota he
 There are two valves at one end of the cylinder, one opening inward and the other facing outward
 silinder ke piston ko jab khinchakar upar ke chor par laayaa jaataa he, tab silinder ke andar kii vaayu kaa dabaav kam ho jaataa he or vayumandal se vaayu is valve dwaara khinch lee jaati he
 When the piston is lowered, the opening valve closes as the pressure increases, and the outside valve opens, allowing the air of the cylinder to drain into the "wind"
 is prakriya ko kai baar dohraane se vayukaksh kii vaayu kaa dabaav dhire dhire badhane lagata he
 Air of appropriate pressure can be used by removing the tap
 vaayu sampidkon ko teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : The diaphragmatic compressors are more commonly used
 inkaa siddhant vaisaa hi he jaisaa upar varnit he
 The air is pumped into the tubes of bicycles and motor vehicles by air pumps
 vaayu sampidkon se praapt sampidit vaayu dwaara chaalit drillon se pahaado main chhed kar surang banaai ja sakati he
 By air compressors, ventilation is done in theaters, cinemas, large buildings and mines, from which unclean air is removed and replaced by pure air
 isi sahaayta se pisai bhi ho sakati he
 Coal, stone, sand, concrete, etc
 are broken and crushed by large hammers from compressed air
 vaayu sampidak se praapt sampidit vaayu se revet kiya ja saktaa he or loha tathaa ispaat chhile ja sakate hai
 With the help of compressed air, polish can be carried on large ships, aircraft, motorcars, etc
 and varnish can be mounted
 gharon kii safai, deevaaron kii safedi tathaa rangaai ore fernichar par varnish chadhaai, vayusampidkon se praapt sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se kam kharch main ho jaati he
 The cleaning of many items and the sowing of houses are also done with its help
 rail ke brake sampidit vaayu ke bal se kaary karte hai
 With the help of compressed air, many goods, such as grains, coal, etc
, can be sent from one place to another
 sampidit vaayu kii upyogita kii suchi kaaphi lambii he
 The use of compressed air is an important feature of modern science

 dashagitika, aryabhatiy or tantra
 But according to experts, he wrote another treatise - 'aryabhata Siddhanta'
 is samay uske keval 34 shloke hi uplabdh hai
 His treatise was widely used in the seventh century
 lekin itnaa upyogi granth lupt kaise ho gaya is vishay main koi nishchit jaankaree nahin milti
 He wrote an important astrological treatise called Aryabhatiya, which describes square root, cube root, parallel series and different types of equations

 Aryabhata presented revolutionary concepts in his short book for the principles of his predecessor and later countries as well as abroad
 unki pramukh kriti, aryabhatiy, ganit or khagol vigyaan kaa ek sangrah he, jise bhartiya ganitiya sahitya main bade paimaane par uddhrut kiya gaya he or jo aadhunik samay main bhi astitv main he
 The mathematical part of Aryabhatiya includes arithmetic, algebra, simple trigonometry and spherical trigonometry

 Arya-siddhanta, a work on astronomical calculations that is now extinct, comes to us from the writings of Varahamihira, contemporary of Aryabhata, as well as later mathematicians and commentators including Brahmagupta and Bhaskara
 I
 It seems that this work is based on the old Surya Siddhanta and compared to the midnight-day calculation in Aryabhatiya's sunrise

 Main article Aryabhatiya aryabhat ke kaary ke pratyaksh vivaran sirf aryabhatiy se hi gyaat hai
 The name Aryabhatiya is given by later commentators, Aryabhata himself would not have named it; This is mentioned by his disciple Bhaskara i in the articles of Ashmakatantra or Ashmaka
 ise kabhi kabhi arya-shat-asht - jo kii unke paath main chhandon kii sankhya he- ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 This sutra is written in a very concise style similar to literature, where each line helps to recall a complex system

 This is the importance of what Aryabhata had discovered without the present day advanced means of astrology
 koparnicus ne jo khoj kii thi uski khoj aryabhat hajaar varsh pehle kar chuke the
 In "golapada", Aryabhata wrote "when a man in a boat moves with the flow, then he understands that the material trees, stones, mountains etc

 He did not use the symbol, of course, but according to the French mathematician Georges Efrah — with zero coefficients, knowledge of zero as a place holder for the power of ten was contained in Aryabhata's place-value digit system
 haalanki, aryabhat ne brahmi ankon kaa prayog nahin kiya tha; vaidic kaal se chali aa rahi sanskrit parampara ko nirantar rakhte hue unhone sankhya ko nirupit karne ke liye varnmaala ke aksharon kaa upyog kiya,matraaon ko smarak ke rup main vyakt karnaa
 Aryabhata worked on Pai's approximation and may have come to know that Pai is irrational

1416, which is perfectly accurate up to five significant figures
 aryabhat ne asann, pichley shabd ke thik pehle aane vaala, shabd kii vyakhya kii vyakhya karte hue kaha he ki yah na keval ek sanniktan he, varan yah ki mulya athulaneey he

 When later writers came to understand that JB is a short form of Jiba, they started using Jiba back
 jiba kaa arth he "khoh" yaa "khai" 
 Later in the twelfth century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic jiba with its Latin counterpart sinus, which literally means "lair" or trench
 or uske baad angreji main, sinus hi sin ban gaya
 a problem of particular interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer solutions to equations that are in the form ax + b = cy, a topic known today as the diophantine equation
 yahan aryabhatiy par bhaskar kii vyakhya se ek udhaaharan dete hai: That is, say n = 8x + 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 This leaves the smallest value 85 for N

 khagol vigyaan ke adhikansh itihaaskaaron ke anusaar yah dwi grahchakr vaala model tolemi ke pehle ke greek khagol vigyaanke tatwon ko pradarshit karata he
 Another element of Aryabhata's model, the Sighrocca, the period of the basic planets in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a mark of an underlying Sun-centered model
 unhone kaha ki chandramaa or grah surya ke paravartit prakaash se chamakate hai
 Unlike the existing cosmology, in which the eclipses were the pseudo-planet Nispand point Rahu and Ketu, they described the eclipses as being cast by the earth and the shadow falling on it

 If added to the modern English units of time, Aryabhata's calculation of the Earth's period of time) was 23 hours 56 minutes and 4
1 seconds; Modern time is 23: 56: 4
091
 isi prakaar, unke hisaab se prithvi ke varsh kii avadhi 365 din 6 ghante 12 minute 30 second, aadhunik samay kii gananaa ke anusaar isamen 3 minute 20 second kii truti he

 With the formation of a new country, the work of choosing different symbols and symbols for the country also started
 desh kaa jhanda pehle hi taiyaar ho chukaa tha, lekin raashtra-geet nahi bana tha
 At the time of independence, Pakistan had no national anthem
 isliye jab bhi dhvaj vandan hota " pakistan jindabad, azaadi pindabad" ke naare lagate the
 Jinnah did not accept this
 ve chaahate the ki pakistan ke raashtra-geet ko rachane kaa kaam sheeghra hi puraa karnaa chahie
 His advice cars suggested him the names of many famous Urdu poets who could have composed the song
 lekin jinnah kii soch kuch ore hi thi
 He felt that this is a good chance to establish the secular image of Pakistan before the world
 isliye unhone lahore ke mahanaurdu shaayar or mul hindu jagannatha azaad ko kaha ki "main aapako paanch din kaa hi samay de saktaa hu, aap pakistan ke liye raashtra-geet likhen"
 Jagannath Azad was also surprised and happy
 lekin pakistan ke kattarpanthi netaa isse bahut naaraaz hue ki ek hindu pakistan kaa raashtra-geet likhegaa
 But they were helpless before Jinnah's wish
 akhirkaar jagannatha azaad ne paanch dinon ke andar raashtra-geet taiyaar kar liya jo jinnah ko bahut pasand aayaa
 The lyrics were - i sarazami e pakjarre tere hai ajasitaro se tabanakaroshan he kehkashan se kahinaj teri khaak Jinnah recognized it as a national song and the song remained a national song till his death
 lekin is geet kii sweekruti ke mahaz 18 maheene baad hi jinnah kaa dehanth ho gaya or unke saath hi raashtra-geet kii manyata bhi khatm kar di gai
 Jagannath Azad later moved to India
 jinnah kii mrityu ke baad pakistan sarkaar ne ek raashtra-geet cameti banaai
 And asked for song samples from well-known poets
 lekin koi bhi geet raashtra-geet ke laayak nahi ban paa rahaa tha
 Finally, the government of Pakistan recognized the tune composed by Ahmed Chagla in 1950 as a national tune
 usee samay iran ke shah pakistan kii yatra par aae or unhone dhun ko kaaphi pasand kiya
 This tune seemed more westernized, but the rashtra-geet Committee believed that its form would be more accepted in Western society

 iske saath hi maatrutiv, pitrutv yaa vyaktigat pahchaan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye iskaa prayog hota he
 At present, fingerprint is considered the best among methods of identification
 jeev jantuon, manushyon main vishesh sanrachanayukta vah rasayan jo use vishisht pahchaan pradaan karata he, use diene kehete hai
 In this method, a person's DNA is identified by biological parts such as blood, hair, saliva, semen or other cell-sources
 diene fingerprint vishisht diene kram kaa prayog karata he, jise microcetellite kaha jaataa he
 Microsatellites are small fragments of DNA
 sharir ke kuch hisson main inaki sankhya alag-alag hoti he
 The activity of the trillions of cells present in the body is determined by DNA
 haalanki diene kanon kaa dhaancha har vyakti main ek samaan hota he, lekin unhen gadhane vaale buniyadi avyavon kaa kram sabhi main samaan nahin hota
 This difference is used to find identities between members of the same species
 is prakriya ko genetic fingerprinting or diene profiling bhi kaha jaataa he
 It was developed in 1984 by Sir Alec Jeffreys, scientist at the University of British Leicester
 forencik vigyaan main diene fingerprint kaa upyog hota he
 Forensic examination no longer requires actual fingerprint
 isaki madad se apradhi ko maatr ek boond ke aadhaar par hi pakadaa ja saktaa he
 The DNA sample is fragmented by the DNA enzyme taken
 iske baad isaki chaanbin karke ise eks-re film par expoj kiya jaataa he jahaan vah blike baar banaate hai, jinhen diene fingerprint kehete hai
 The Jeevan Sutra, that is, in all living organisms of the world, is based on heredity like humans
 yah kisi bhi jeev kii har sookshm ikai main paaya jaataa he
 Each organism can be distinguished from any other organism on the basis of subtle variations hidden in this life formula derived from its biological parents
 jivan sutara ke in atyadhik parivarti khandon ko alag karke, radio sakriy banaaye jane ke baad vaigyanik vidhi dwaara vishleshan karne se ek vyakti vishesh kaa kramadesh praapt kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki kramadarsh manushya ke liye usee tarah vishisht hota he, jaise ki anguuthe kaa nishaan
 Hence this method is popularly known as DNA finger printing

 Human being is identified by its qualities and name
 do vyakti sabhi gunon main samaan nahin hote
 Even if twins are the same, then there are differences among them
 twachaa kaa rang, baalo kaa rang, ankhon kii putliyon kaa rang, lambaai, awaz, chalane, uthne baithne kaa dhang, baat karne kaa tarika, rahan-sahan aadi aise lakshan hai, jinase manushyon main antar or pahchaan kii ja sakati he

 The number of crimes in the world is increasing both with the development of civilization and science
 aparaadhon ke tareekon ke naye prakaar viksit ho gayi hai
 To prevent the flood of these crimes, only [first finger printing] is used
 rakt pareekshan se bhi aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney main sahaayta mili he
 DNA finger printing is the most unique new biological technique in the field of biotechnology
 is takanic kaa vikaas sarvapratham 1985 main england ke laicester vishvavidhyalay ke pro alek jeffris ne kiya tha
 The DNA fingerprint technique is the result of genetic science
 grager jon mendal dwaara anuvanshiki se ambandhitniyamon kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya, jo sarvaadhik pramanit or baad main anusandhanon ke liye atyadhik upyogi siddh hue
 The life formula is a very stable chemical element, so even after the sample has been taken, it can be told the program of a particular person
 di en e finger printing dwaara banaaya gaya kramadarsh jivan paryant ek sa hi rahata he
 There are various stages of DNA fingerprinting techniques
 yahaan teen vibhinn vyaktiyon ke gel pratichitra dekhie, jinka aapas main koi rishta nahin he
 These images look quite different from each other and each image is unique
 ek hi parivaar ke teen sadasyon ke gel pratichitra gailaree main dikhaae hai
 Here the images of mother and father are different, but the image of the son bears some resemblance to the images of mother and father
 yahaan samaan judawaan bacchon ke pratichitra ko dekhenge, to dikhataa he; ki ye donon purnataya ekasmaan hai
 Thus different individuals can be identified by DNA finger printing, the mother or father of the offspring can be identified; But it is not possible to identify identical twins
 tritiy charan Fourth phase pancham charan Parent and child prints judwaaon ke print Inability to print identities of twins di en e finger printing ek nutan evam shashakt takanic he, jo nimnlikhit kshetron main prayog main laayi ja sakati he:- Through DNA sealing, positive identification can be done at the individual level through blood semen, hair, mutilated dead body remains, teeth or bone fragments etc

 Because each person has a DNA of both the parents, this can be confirmed on the basis of the impression of the DNA
 forensik jaev praudyogiki abhi ek nayaa kshetra he, jo jangalon main hone vaale aparaadhon ko sulajhaayen ke liye ek hathiyaar kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The Indian judicial system has accepted DNA finger printing as concrete evidence
 mritak ke sharir ke bikhare hue tukdon kii pahchaan karne ke liye bhi is takanic kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 This technique was used for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and former Chief Minister of Punjab Beant Singh
 inke atirikt anekon aparaadhon ke maamle is takanic dwaara sulajhaaye gaye hai
 Comparison of the commands received by DNA finger printing with the remains of the bodies of the dead defensemen during accidents, such as a war period, or a shipwreck, as compiled in the biographies of defense personnel
 The method can be proven

 According to Sayan, the reason for this naming is that these texts were studied in Aranya
 aaranyak kaa mukhya vishay yajyabhaagon kaa anushthan na hokar tadantargat anushthanon kii aadhyatmik mimasaa he
 In fact, the ritual of Yajna is a highly mystical symbolic trade and full details of this symbol are given in the Aranyaka texts

 In the Aranyak texts, the glory of pranavidya is given a special presentation
 pranavidya ke atirikt pratikopasna, brahmavidya, aadhyatmikta kaa varnan karne se aaranyakon kii vishesh mahatta he
 Due to the presentation of many historical and cultural facts, Aranyak Granth is also Upodaya

 The doer of the first three Aranyakas of Aitareya is Mahidas, it is justified to consider him a contemporary of Aitareya Brahmin
 iskaa bhi sambandh rugveda se he
 It is similar to Aitareya Aranyak and is divided into fifteen chapters, a part of which is known as Kaushitaki Upanishad
 das parichchhedon main vibhakt he, jinhen "aran" kehete hai
 In this, the seventh, the eight and the ninth principal are together called "taittiriya Upanishad"
 vastut: shukla yujrveda kaa ek aaranyak hi he, parantu aadhyatmik tathyon kii prachurtaa ke kaaran yah upanishdon main gina jaataa he
