 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga a sutra is a way of expressing a big thing in a superfluous form
 iskaa upyog sahitya, vyakaran, ganit, vigyaan aadi main hota he
 The sutra literally means thread or rope
 jis prakaar dhaagaa vastuon ko aapas main jodakar ek vishisht rup pradaan karam he, usee prakaar sutara bhi vichaaron ko samyak rup se jodta he
 The sutra in Hindu is also indicative of a particular type of literary genre
 jaise patanjali kaa yogasutra or panini kaa ashtaadhi aadi
 There are small but pithy sentences in sutra literature which are well interlinked
 inamen praayah paribhaashik evam takneekee shabdon kaa khulkar kiya jaataa he taaki good se good baat bhi sankshep main kintu spashtataa se kahi ja sake
 The importance of sutra literature in ancient times was because most texts were composed with the intention of memorizing; So it was particularly useful to be brief
 chunki sutara atyant sankshipt hote the, kabhi-kabhi inkaa arth samajhnaa kathin ho jaataa tha
 As a solution to this problem, the practice of writing annotations of many sutra texts also became prevalent
 bhashya, sutron kii vyakhya karte the
 The sutras in Buddhism refer to the sermons in which Gautama Buddha's teachings are compiled
 vaayu puraana main 'sutara' kii nimnlikhit paribhaasha di gayi he- The sutra is called sutra

 There are six types of sutras mentioned in Ashtadhyayi - sutara pitak The scientific and technical literature of Sanskrit is huge

 sabase laghu granth 'sutara granth' kehalaate hai
 These are short abstract sentences written in short form for the purpose of memorization
 inamen koi vyakhya nahin hoti, koi siddhi nahin hote
 The Yogasutras of Patanjali, the Vyakaran Sutras of Panini, the Brahmasutras of Vedavyas, the Kamasutras of Vatsyayana are examples of this
 kisi prasiddh sutaragranth kii vyakhya ko bhashya kehete hai
 But the text can be a textbook too
 aadi shankaracharya kii brahmasutron kaa bhashya prasiddh he
 The theoretical research is called 'theory'
 suryasiddhanth surya kii gati kaa vivechan karata he
 'tantra' means 'technique'
 khagol ke sandarbh main iskaa arth he - 'akashiya pindon se sambandhit gananaa'
 The Tantrasangraha of Neelakantha is a similar text
 'geetika', 'darpan', 'deepika' aadi praarambhik granth hai jo navasikhuon ke nimitt likhe jate hai
 Therefore 'siddhantdeepika' will be called 'introduction to theoretical astronomy' in modern times

 chhayavaad hindi sahitya ke romantic utthan kii vah kavy-dhara he jo lagbhag i
sa
 1918 se 1936 tak kii pramukh yugavani rahi
 Spiritual expression, love of nature, love of women, humanization, cultural awakening, imaginary primacy, etc
 are the main features of cinematic poetry
 chhayavaad ne hindi main khadi boli kavita ko purnatah pratishthit kar diya
 After this Brajbhasha got out of the Hindi poetry stream
 isane hindi ko nae shabd, pratik tathaa bimb die
 This effect also enriched the language of prose of this period
 hindi kavita main chhayavaad kaa yug dvivedi yug ke baad aayaa
 The poetry of Dwivedi era was monotonous didactic and chronological
 chhayavaad main iske viruddh vidroh karte hue kalpanapradhan, bhavonmeshyukt kavita rachi gai
 It was greatly influenced by the Gitanjali of the famous poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore of Bangla of his era at the level of language and sentiments
 yah pracheen sanskrit sahitya or madhyakaalin hindi sahitya se bhi prabhavit hui
 In this, the influence of Buddhist philosophy and Sufi philosophy is also targeted
 chhayavadyug us saanskrithik or saahitiyik jaagran kaa saarvbhaum vikaaskaal tha jiskaa aarambh rashtriya paridhi main bhaaratenduyug se hua tha
 Not only the subtle emotional philosophy of the poet, 'chhaya' also introduces his subtle articulation
 uski kavyakala main vaacharth kii apeksha lakshanikta or dhvanyaatmakataa he
 There is also malaise due to the purity of the feeling
 style main raag kii navdbuddhata athwa naveen vyanjaktaa he
 In the Dwivedi era, poetry was composed of poetry
 vastut: gadhy kaa prabandh hi usamen padya ho gaya tha, bhashaa bhi gadhyvat ho gai thi
 Shadowism broke the structure of the verse and made the standing dialect poetic
 padya main sthool itivrutt tha, chhayavaad ke kavy main bhavatmak atanrvrutt tha, chhayavaad ke kavy main bhavatmak antarvrutt aa gaya
 According to sentiment, the language and verses of Chhayavad also became emotional and sentimental
 brajabhasha ke baad chhayavaad dwaara geetkavy kaa punarutthan hua
 Representative poets of the Shadow Age era are Prasad, Nirala, Pant, Mahadevi, Ramkumar
 purvanugami sahyogi hai- maakhanlaal or 'naveen'
 After Geetakavya, the epic was also produced in Chhatism
 tulsidas jaise 'swant:' ko lekar loksangrah ke path par agrasar hue the vaise hi chhayavaad ke kavi bhi 'swatm' ko lekar ekant ke swagat jagat se saarvajanik jagat main agrasar hue
 Prasad's 'kamayani' and Pant's 'lokayatan' are proof of this
 'kamayani' sindhu main vindu kii ore he, 'lokayatan' vindu main sindhu kii ore
 Around 1917, the poet Maithili Sharan Gupta, Mukutdhar Pandey, etc
, tended to give Khadiboli poetry a more imaginative, pictorial, and emotional expression
 This free and novel method was finding its way out that the mystical poems of Rabindranath were celebrated
 or kai kavi ek saath rahasyavaad or pratikwaad athwa chitrabhashavad ko hi ekant dhairya banakar chal pade
 When the goal was fixed on the picture language or expression method, then the field of cosmic or supernatural love was deemed to be the rest for its performance
 is bandhe hue kshetra ke bheetar chalanevaale kavy ne chhayavaad naam grahan kiya
 The use of the word shadowy should be understood in two meanings
 ek to rahasyavaad ke arth main, jahaan uskaa sambandh kavy-vastu se hota he arthath jahaan kavi us anant or agyaat priyatam ko alamban banaakar atyant chitramayi bhashaa main prem kaa anek prakaar se vyanjan karata he
 The second use of this meaning is in the broader sense of poetry-style or method-specific
 'shadowism generally means the presentation of the unprepared as a euphemistic shadow in place of the present
 chhayavaad kaa chalan dvivedi kaal kii rukhi itivrittatmak kii pratikriya ke rup main hua tha
 For example, my honey songs are hidden in a pile of dust, unknowingly
 prakruti ke sookshm kintu vyakt saundarya main aadhyatmik chaaya kaa bhaan mere vichaar se chhayavaad kii ek sarvamaanya vyakhya honi chahie
 ' dwitiya mahayuddh ke samaapt hote saare desh main nai chetana kii lahar daud gai
 In 1929, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, India became determined to sweep away foreign slavery
 ise sirf raajnneeti tak hi simit nahin samajhnaa chaiye
 It was an attempt to understand the self-image of the entire country and by correcting its mistakes, it was resolved to move towards the antipathy towards the rich nations of the world
 sankshep main, yah ek mahaan saanskrithik andolan tha
 Mindful orientation was the main origin of this poem and its strong faith in the changing mind
 is shrenee ke kavi grahikashakti se bahut adhik sampann the or saamaajik vishmata or asamanjasyon ke prati atyadhik sajag the
 In terms of style too, they were completely different from earlier poets
 inaki rachana mukhyatah vishayi pradhan thi
 In the 1920s Khadiboli poetry, the primacy of the theme remained
 parantu iske baad kii kavita main kavi ke apane raag-viraag kii pradhanta ho gai
 How is the subject in itself? This was not the main thing
 balki mukhya baat yah rah gai thi ki vishayi ke chitt ke raag-viraag se anuranjit hone ke baad vishay kaisaa dikhta he ? parinaam vishay isamen gaun ho gaya or kavi pramukh’ Around 1920, the enlightened consciousness of the era, depressed by external expression, started self-oriented introverted cultivation, it was expressed in poetry as shadowism ' ‘ chhayavaad shabd kaa arth chaahe jo ho, parantu vyaavhaarik drushti se yah prasad, niraala, pant, mahadevi kii un samast kavitaaon kaa dyotak he, jo 1918 se 36 i
 ke bich likhi gayi
 'he further writes-' Shadowism is the poetic expression of the national awakening which wanted liberation from the old stereotypes on the one hand and foreign subjugation on the other
 ’ 'in the field of poetry, unlike any incident of mythological era or external description of the beauty of the country and abroad, when the self-evident expression started on the basis of anguish, in Hindi, it was named as Chhayavism
 ’ prasad ji ant main kehete hai- chhayavaadi kavita bhartiya drushti se anubhuti or abhivyakti kii bhangima par adhik nirbhar karti he
 Phoneticism, semiotics, beauty, nature-law, and the variability of self-perception along with healing curvature are characteristic of Chhatism
 ’ Chadism is considered influenced by Romanticism of Western literature
 ve chhayavaad kaa mul darshan sarvatmavaad ko maanati hai or prakruti ko uskaa saadhan
 His cinematography laid down life in relation to the heart and nature of man, which has been in the form of image since ancient times and due to which man felt nature depressed in his grief and pulsed in happiness' thus Mahadevi According to the poetry of Shadowism, by creating a positive connection with our nature, we generate a wide feeling in our heart and we are all over the world
 Integral expressions regarding the causes've added
 ve rahasyavaad ko chhayavaad kaa doosraa sopan maanati hai
 We can divide the major trends of Shadowism under three or two headings
 chhayavaad main sabhi kaviyon ne apane anubhav ko meraa anubhav kahkar abhivyakt kiya he
 The style behind this is the primitive youth's aspiration for social freedom to express themselves
 kahani ke paatro athwa puranic paatro ke madhyam se abhivyakti kii chir aacharit or anubhav siddh naatakeey pranali uske bhaavon ko abhivyakt karne main purnatah samarth nahin thi
 Freedom of expressive expression was associated with the liberation of the individual
 yah vyaktik abhivyakti bhaktikalin kaviyon ke aatmanivedan se bahut aage kii cheez he
 It was inferior to the physical personality
 isapar dharm kaa aavaran nahin tha
 Rejecting the feudal ethics, Pant has expressed his love for the girl in tears and tears simply: "the girl was my delectable friend
" "vyaktik kshetra se aage badhkar niraala ne apni putree ke nidhan par shoakgeet likhaa or jivan kii anek baaten saaf-saaf kah daali
 The return of free verse by the editors, the literal attack of the opponents, the marriage of Saroj in a completely new way, breaking the social stereotypes, etc
 In writing, i directly expressed my experiences of the social field in style
 isi tarah vanbela main niraala ne apni kahani ke madhyam se puraani saamaajik roodhiyon par or aadhunik arth pishaachon par prahaar kiya he
 Woman-beauty and love-portrayal The poetical poets have considered woman to be an icon of love
 unhone nari ko preyasi ke rup main grahan kiya jo yauvan or hrruday kii sampurna bhaawanaaon se paripurna he
 In which the beauty of the earth and the imaginary Sushma of heaven are coordinated
 atah in kaviyon ne preyasi ke kai chitra ankit kiye hai
 In Kamayani, Prasad fills magic in portraying Shraddha
 chhayavaadi kaviyon kaa prem bhi vishisht he
 The best description of nature beauty and its love is also a notable feature of the cinematic poets
 beeti vibhavari jaag ri,ambar panghat main duubo rahithara ghat ushaa nagari
 or divsavsaan kaa samaymeghmay aasmaan seutar rahi That evening beauty fairy-c slowly
 svachhndatavaadi pravriti is pravriti kaa prarambh shridhar pathak kii kavitaaon se hota he
 The nature of verse, manner of expression and observation of the nature of nature etc
 trends appeared in Chāyavad
 saath-saath swanubhuti kii pratyaksh vivritti, jo vyaktigat pranay se lekar karunaa or anand tak faili hui he
 Critics have pointed out the effect of freedom on shadowism, and on the other hand have also opposed it
 svachhndathawad kii yah pravriti deshgat, kaalgat, rudhiyon ke viruddh hameshaa rahati hai
 Wherever there are bonds, the freedomist poet opposes these trends at all levels of society, state, poetry and life
 angreji sahitya main svachhndatavaadi kavy se pehle kathor anushaasan tha or uskaa rup dharmik, naitik or kavyashastreey bhi tha
 Therefore, the English poets despised these bonds
 lekin chhayavaadi kaviyon se purv dvivediyug main naitik drushti kii pradhanta milti he or chhayavaadi main uskaa virodh bhi dikhaai detaa he
 The shadowy tendency was not that of Swachand Pranay but of revivalists
 kyonki reetikalin shringaar-chithran kaa us par prabhaav he
 Where philosophical principles are concerned, the expression of the old principles of Sarvaism, Karmism, Vedanta, Shaivism, Advaitism etc
 is found in the Chhayavadi poetry
 jahaan tak bhashaa-style kaa sawaal he, chhayavaadi kii abhivyanjana paddati naveen or tazaa he
 There is more coherence, descriptiveness in the Dwivediugin Khadiboli
 parantu chhayavaadi kavy main sookshmata ke nirupan ke kaaran upachaar-vakrata or maanvikaran kii visheshtaayen dikhaai detii hai
 Dwivediyugin poetry is subjective, narrative-oriented and macro, while cinematic poetry is subjective and imaginative
 dvivediyugin kavita main sristi kii vyapaktaa or anekarupata ko sameta gaya he
 Similarly, in the poetry of Shadowism, there is an attempt to reveal the eloquence of the occult
 manojgat ke sookshm satya ko saakaar karne ke liye chhayavaadi kaviyon ne urvara kalpanaashakti kaa upyog kiya he
 Shadowism has an influence ranging from Vedanta to Anandaism
 isamen buddha or gandhi darshan kii bhi jhalak milti he
 “tum Tung Himalaya Shringa and i playful pace Sur Sarita
 tum vimal hrruday uchhavas or main kaant kamini kavita
 " "auron ko hanste dekho manu, hanso or sukh paao
 Forget your happiness, make everyone happy
 " "away from knowledge, some action is different, why should the wish be fulfilled of the mind, the two cannot meet, this is the irony of life
" " "tenacity, a sweet and sweet mind, austerity in world pain, your sweet liberation is bound, become odorless and you smell
 " See examples of some of Jaishankar Prasad's works - through symbols he has increased the poignancy of his expression

 Jivanananda Das is the most popular Rabindranath poet of Bangladesh, born in Borishal
 unhen 1955 main maranoparant shreshth kavita ke liye sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 His first collection of poems was published in 1926
 jhara paalak, dhoosar pandulipi, banlata sen, mahapruthibi, rupasi bangala aadi unki bahucharchit kritiyaan hai
 By rejecting the influence of Rabindranath's romantic poetry, he gave birth to a different poetic language which was not acceptable to the reader-society earlier
 parantu 20veen sadi ke shesh bhaag se vah ubhar kar aayen or pathak ke dilodimag ko chaa gayi
 At first, Rabindranath also had bitter criticism against his poetry
 unke jeevankaal main vah keval 269 kavitaayen prakaash kar paye the jisamen 162 tha unke prakashit sankalnon main
 After his death all his unpublished poems have come to light, this number has increased to more than 800

 kavyagranth The novel prabandh-nibandh-aalochana Sirhul is a major festival of tribals that is celebrated in the tribal areas of Jharkhand, Odisha, Bengal and Central India

 Sarhul literally means 'sal worship', the Sarhul festival is dedicated to Mother Earth - nature is worshiped during this festival
 sarhul kai dinon tak manaaya jaataa he, jisamen mukhya paaramparik nrity sarhul nrity kiya jaataa he
 Sarhul is celebrated during the spring and Sal trees receive new flowers on their branches
 adivaasiyon kaa maananaa he ki ve is tyohaar ko manaae jane ke baad hi nai fasal kaa upyog mukhya rup se dhan, pedo ke pattey, phulon or falon ke fal kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 The Sarhul Festival is associated with the Mahabharata according to several legends
 jab mahabharat yuddh chal rahaa tha to munda janajaatiy logon ne kaurav sena kii madad kii or unhone iske liye bhi apana jivan balidaan kiya
 Many Munda fighters died fighting the Pandavas in the battle
 Therefore, to identify their dead bodies, their bodies were covered with leaves and branches of Sal trees
 nikaayon jo pattiyon or shakhaon ke pedo se dhanke hue the, surakshit nahin the, jabaki anya shav, jo ki saal ke ped se nahin aate the, vikrut ho gaye the or kam samay ke bheetar sad gaya the
 This shows his faith in the Sal tree which is much stronger than the Sarhul festival
 tyohaar ke dauraan phulon ke phool sarna par laae jate hai or pujari janajatiyon ke sabhi devataaon kaa praayshchit karata he
 a sarna is a group of trees where tribals worship on various occasions

 In spite of no theoretical differences, the classification of the devoid has been done mainly on two grounds
 pratham prakaar ke vargeekaran kaa aadhaar he, doorabeen urdhv samtal main puraa chakkar kaat sakati he yaa nahin
 The second basis of classification is the facility to read part-fraction of the inscribed circle in the instruments, such as the Vernier decolonization, in which the vernier scale is used to read the division portion of the circle; Micrometer theodolite, which uses micrometer screws to read portions; Glass arc theodolimeters, which have inscribed circles of glass and arrange the optical facility to bring the reflection of the arcs read to the observer

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Pythagorean theorem ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 The Pythagorean theorem is a relation theorem between all three sides of a right triangle in Euclide geometry
 is prameya ko aamtaur par ek sameekaran ke rup main nimnlikhit tareeke se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he- Where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides
 pithagoras yunaan ke ganitagya the
 Traditionally, he is credited with the discovery of this theorem, although it is believed that the information of this theorem dates back to him
 bharat ke pracheen granth boudhayan shulbasutra main yah prameya diya hua he
 There is considerable evidence that the Babylonian mathematicians also knew this theory
 ise 'boudhayan-pithagoras prameya' bhi kehete hai
 If we take the length of the hypotenuse c and the length of the other two sides a and b, then the theorem can be expressed as the following equation: yaa, If c is already given and the length of one arm is to be derived, the following equation can be used: yaa This equation provides a simple relation between the three sides of a right-angled triangle
 is prameya kaa samanyikaran 'kojya niyam' kehalaata he jisaki sahaayta se kisi bhi trikon ke teesri bhujaa kii lambaai kii gananaa kii ja sakati he yadi shesh do bhujaaon kii lambaai or unke bich ke kone kii maap di gayi ho
 This is a theorem that has probably the most evidence compared to other theorems
 elisha scot loomis dwaara rachit paaythagorian theram kitaab main, 367 pramaan die gaye hai
 Like most of the proofs of the Boudhayan theorem, it is based on the property of being proportional to the arms of two identical triangles
 mana ABC ek samakon tribhuj he, jisamen kone c samakon he, jaisaa akruti main dikhaaya gaya he
 We draw a perpendicular to the hypotenuse from point c and the length of that length with arm AB is H
 yah nayaa trikon ACH hamaare trikon ABC ke samroop he, kyonki un donon main hi samakon he or a kone unka hissaa he
 This means that the third angle is also the same in both triangles
 isi aadhaar par tribhuj CBH bhi ABC ke samroop he
 From these analogies we get two proportions: jaise And inhen aise bhi likhaa ja saktaa he Summarizing these two equations, anya shabdon main, boudhayan prameya: In Euclid's Elements, Proposition 47 of Book 1, the Boudhayan theorem is proved by an argument along the following lines
 A, B, c ko samakon trikon ke kone maanate hai, jisamen samakon a par hoga
 a se karn ke vipareet ek adholamb chhoden varg main karn par
wo rekha karn par varg ko do aaayaaton main vibhajit karti he, prayek kaa samaan kshetra he kyunki donon main se ek pairon main varg banataa he
 For formal proof, we need four primary lemmata: is pramaan ke peeche sahaj vichaar, jo iskaa paalan karnaa aasaan bana saktaa he, ki upar ke do virgon ko ek hi aakaar ke samanaantar chaturbhuj main badla gaya he, phir modakar or baayen or daahine aayat ko nichle varg main badla gaya he, phir nirantar kshetra main
 The proof is as follows: yah pramaan euclid ke tatwon main prastaav 1
47 ke rup main pesh hota he
 James A
 Garfield is credited with a novel algebraic proof: puraa samalamb bai varg kaa aadha he, to uskaa kshetrafal = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 Each area of triangle 1 and triangle 2 is ab / 2
 trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal c2 / 2 he or yah karn par varg kaa aadha he
 But also the area of triangle 3 = - isliye karn par varg = anya do parshvon ke virgon kaa jod he
 In this proof, one can add 4 copies of square plus triangle on the hypotenuse as squares on the other two sides plus 4 copies of triangle
 This proof has been recorded from China
 upar euclid ke pramaan ke chitra se, ham teen samaan aankadon ko dekh sakate hai, prayek main "ek varg ke upar trikon" he
 Because the larger triangle is made up of two smaller triangles, its area is the sum of these two smaller ones
 samanta se, teen varg ek duusare ke saath usee anupaat main hai jaise vah teen trikon or isi tarah ke bade varg kaa kshetrafal do chote virgon ke kshetrafal kaa jod he
 Evidence from the anagram is given through illustration and animation
 is udhaaharan main, har ek bade varg kaa kshetrafal 2 he
 In both, the area of the same triangle is removed
 shesh kshetron, a2 + b2 or c2, baraabar hai
 QED yah pramaan vastav main bahut aasaan he, lekin yah praarambhik nahin he, is arth main ki yah keval sabase buniyadi siddhant or yucalidian jyamiti ke pramayon par nirbhar nahin he
 In particular, while it is very easy to give the formula for the area of triangles and squares, it is not easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of the areas of its pieces
 vastav main, aavashyak gun sabit karnaa paaythagorian prameya siddh karne kii tulana main kathin he 
vastav main, yah kathinaayee sabhi saadhaaran kshetra shaamil yucalidian pramaan ko prabhavit karata he; udhaaharan ke liye, ek samakon trikon kaa kshetra paane ke liye ek dharna shaamil he ki yah ek hi oonchai or tal ke ek aayat kaa aadha kshetra he
 For this reason, axiomatic introduction to geometry generally uses another proof based on the similarity of triangles
 is paaythagorian prameya kaa teesraa graphic chithran main karn kaa varg parshvon ke varg main feet baithta he
 a related proof may show that the restored parts are identical to the original and, because the sum of the same is the same, that their areas are also the same
 yah dikhaane ke liye kii ek varg hi parinaam he, hame nae parshvon kii lambaai ko c ke baraabar dikhaanaa padegaa
dhyaan den kii is pramaan ke kaam karne ke liye, hame chote varg ko or adhik hisson main kaatane ke tareeke ko sanbhaalane ke liye rasta pradaan karnaa hoga chunki parshv or chote hote jaayenge
 The algebraic variation of this proof is provided by the following argument
 chithran ko dekhte hue jo ek bada varg he jiske konon main samaan samakon trikon he, in chaar trikon main prayek kaa kshetra c ke saath ek kone ke dwaara diya gaya he
 The A-lateral angles and B-lateral angles of these triangles are the supplementary angles, each of the angles of the blue region are right angles, making this area a square whose side length is C
 is varg kaa kshetrafal he C2
is tarah samast kaa kshetra diya jaataa he: However, the length of the sides of the larger square is a + B, we can calculate its area as 2, which extends into A2 + 2AB + B2
 boudhayan prameya main pahunchaa ja saktaa he nimnlikhit chitra ke adhyayan se kii ek parshv main parivartan kaise karn main ek parivartan ke utpaadan kar saktaa he or ek thoda kalan kaa upyog karke
 As a result of the change in side of a, da, trikon kii samanta or antar main badlaav ke liye
isliye On the separation of variables
 parshv b main parivartan ke liye ek doosraa kaarykaal jodne kaa parinaam he
 Consolidated returns jab a = 0 tab c = b, to b2 "nirantar" he
 So jaise dekha ja saktaa he, parivartan or parshvon ke bich vishesh anupaat ke kaaran he yah varg jabaki parshvon main parivartan kii swatantra yogadan kaa parinaam raashi he jo jyamitiya saakshyon se spasht nahin he
 From this given ratio it can be shown that the changes in the sides are inversely proportional to the sides
 is vibhedak sameekaran suzav detaa he kii yah prameya sambandhit parivartan ke kaaran he or iske vyutpatti lagbhag line abhinn abhikalan ke samaan he
 This quantity da and dc are very small changes in a and c respectively
 lekin ham iske badale vaastavik sankhya Δa and Δc kaa upyog karte hai, tab unke anupaat kii seemaa da / dc he jab unka aakaar shunya nikatataa, vyutpanni or c / a bhi nikatataa he, trikon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa anupaat or vibhedak sameekaran kaa parinaam pataa chalata he
 The antonym of this theorem is also true: kisi bhi teen dhanatmak sankhya a, b or c aisi he a2 + b2 = c2, vahaan ek trikon maujuud he jiske parshv hai a, b or c or har aise trikon main parshvon ke bheech ek samakon he jinaki lambaai a or b he
 This antonym is present in the elements of Euclid
 kosine kii vidhi kaa prayog karke yah sabit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa nimnlikhit pramaan ke dwaara: Let ABC be a triangle whose sides are a, b and c, with a2 + b2 = c2
 We have to prove that the angles between a and b sides are right angles
 ham ek or trikon kaa nirmaan karte hai jisamen parshvon ke bich ek samakon he jisaki lambaai a or b he
 From the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse length of this triangle is also c
 chunki donon trikon ke parshvon kii ek hi lambaai he a, b or c, ve anukool hai or isliye unka ek hi kone hona chahie
isliye, jin parshvon kii lambaai a or b he hamaare mul trikon main unke bich kaa kone ek samakon he
 An approximation of the inverse of the Pythagorean theorem is a simple way of determining if a triangle is right-angled, obtuse, or acute, thus
 Where c is chosen as the longest of the three sides: ek paaythagorian tripal main teen sakaaratmak purnank hai a, b or c, jaise kii a2 + b2 = c2
anya shabdon main, ek paaythagorian tripal ek samakon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa varnan karata he jahaan teenon parshv kii purnank lambaai he
 Evidence from large stone monuments in Northern Europe shows that such triplets were known before the discovery of writing

 kaatizian nirdeshaank main duurastha formula ko paaythagorian prameya se se praapt kiya gaya he
 If and are points in the square, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by atirikt saamanytah se, yucalidian main n-antar, do binduon ke bich kii yucalidian duuri, a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,} or a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,}, paaythagorian prameya kaa upyog karte hue, paribhaashit kiya gaya he: The Boudhayan theorem was generalized among Euclid's elements: agar koi ek samaan aankade khadaa karata he ek samakon trikon ke parshvon main, to do chhoton ke kshetron kaa jod bade ke kshetrafal ke baraabar he
 The Baudhayan theorem is a special case of the more general theorem related to the length of the sides, the method of cosine: is jatil aantarik utpaada antariksh main do vector v or w diya jaae, to boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit rup le leti he: In particular, || v + w || 2 = || v || 2 + || w || 2 if v and w are rectangles, although the antonym is not necessarily true

 ) udhaaharan ke liye, goleey jyamiti main, octate se simit ikai kshetra ke samakon trikon ke teenon parshvon kii lambaai π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} ke baraabar he; yucalidian paaythagorian prameya kaa ulanghan karti he kyunki π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} This means that in the Euclidean theorem, the Pythagorean theorem must take a different form from the Euclidean theorem
 Here two cases have to be considered - spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; In every case, like the Euclidean case, the law of proper cosine results in: ek gola jisaki trigya r he usapar koi bhi samakon trikon ke liye, paaythagorian prameya yah rup letaa he This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines
 is kosine samaaroh ke liye mcclaurin shrinkhalaa kaa upyog karke, yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he ki trigya r anantta tak pahunchataa he, ke rup main he, paaythagorian prameya kaa golakaar rup yucalidian rup tak pahunchataa he
 For any triangle in this hyperbolic plane, the Pythagorean theorem takes this form jahaan cosh ke atishyoktipurna kosine he
 Using the mclaurin series for this function, it can be shown that the exaggerated form of the Pythagorean theorem is closely related to the Euclidean form, as the hyperbolic triangle becomes very small
 atishyoktipurna jyamiti main, ek samakon trikon ke liye bhi likhaa ja saktaa he, Where a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} is the angle of equality of the line segment now that a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} where μ is the multiplication distance function

 The history of this theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of the Pythagorean triple, knowledge of the relationship between right triangle triangles, knowledge of the relationship between adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem
 misr main bade pattharon kaa bana smarak lagbhag 2500 BC se or uttari europe main, purnank parshvon ke samakon trikon shaamil hai
 Bartel Leindert von der Varden estimates that this Pythagorean triple was discovered from algebra
 2000 or 1786 BC ke bich likhaa gaya, misr kii madhyam kingdom papirus berlin 6619 main ek samasya shaamil he jiskaa samaadhaan ek paaythagorian tripal he
 Plimpton 322, a notebook of Mesopotamia, was written during the reign of the great Hammurabi in 1790 and 1750 BC, including several entries closely related to the Pythagorean triple
 baudhyanasulba sutara, jisaki vibhinn tarik 8 veen shatabdi BC or 2 veen shatabdi BC ke bich die gaye hai, bharat main, jisamen paaythagorian tripal kii ek suchi shaamil he jisaki khoj bijiy se hui he, paaythagorian prameya kaa ek bayaan or ek samdvibahu samakon trikon ke liye paaythagorian prameya kaa jyamithik pramaan he
 The Apastamba Sulba formula contains numerical evidence of the general Pythagorean theorem, using a field computation
 Vonr Varden believes "it was certainly based on earlier traditions"
 According to Albert Burke, this is the original proof of the theorem
 ; He further theorem that Pythagoras visited Arakkonam, India and copied it
 paaythagoras ne, jisaki tareekhen saamanytah 569-475 BC di gai he, paaythagorian tripal ke nirmaan ke liye bijiy tareeke kaa istemaal karke, euclid main proklose kii camentry ke anusaar
proklose ne, tathaapi, 410 or 485 AD ke bich likhaa tha
 Sir Thomas L
 According to Heath, Pythagoras had no attribution of the theorem until Pythagoras survived for five centuries
 However, when authors such as Plutarch and Cicerou held the Pythagorean theorem, they did so in a way that would make the planting widely known and undoubtedly are
 400 BC ke dauraan, proklose ke anusaar, plato ne paaythagorian tripal ko khojane kii ek vidhi di jise bijganit or jyamiti sanghatit hua
 Around 300 BC, in Euclid's "elements", the oldest current theory proof of the theorem was introduced
 kuch samay 500 BC or 200 AD ke bich likhaa gaya tha, chini paath chau pi suan ching, paaythagorian prameya kaa ek drishy pramaan detaa he - china main ise "gaugu prameya" kaha jaataa he — trikon ke liye
haan rajvansh ke dauraan, 202 BC se 220 AD tak, paaythagorian tripal ko ganitiya kala ke nauven adhyay main dekha gaya he, samakon trikon ke ek ullekh ke saath
 The first recorded use in China, known as the "gaugu Theorem", is known in India as the Bhaskara Theorem
 kaaphi bahes he kii kya paaythagorian prameya kii khoj ek yaa kai baar hui thi
 Boer thinks that the elements found in the Shulba Sutra may be of Mesopotamian origin

 dil-e-nadan or dil-e-nadan is a urdu-hindi phrase used in many contexts in the culture of North India and Pakistan
 yah mul rup main farsi kaa vaakyansh he or usamen is دلِ ناداں likhaa jaataa he
 It is often used in situations when a person is forced to do things that are contrary to the dictates of his intellect or in which he is in turmoil due to his own unavoidable circumstances due to his feelings
 bhartiya upmahadweep main is vaakyansh kii lokapriyata mirza gaalib kii ek ghazal se hui, jisamen unke hryday ko aisi premika ke liye uttejit darshaya gaya he jise unke prem kii koi qadar nahin he
 Often two lions of this ghazal are said to be the most: iskaa prayog bahut si aadhunik saanskrithik rachanaaon main hua he
 In 1982, a Hindi film named "dil-e-nadaan" was made with the lead actor-actress Rajesh Khanna, Shatrughan Sinha, Jayaprada and Smita Patil
 1983 main bani film "razia sultan" main isi sheershak kaa gaanaa hema malini par darshaya gaya
 dil-e-nadan is also the name of an Indian-origin music group in Trinidad
 18 june ko prati varsh goa kranti diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Because on 18-06-1946 Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia inspired the people of Goa to raise their voice against the Portuguese
 18 june goa kii aazaadee kii ladai ke itihaas main swarna aksharon se likhaa gaya he
 On 18 June 1946, Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia ji gave a message to the people of Goa to unite and fight against Portuguese rule
 18 june ko hui is kranti ke joshilay bhaashan ne aazaadee kii ladaai ko majboot kiya or aage badhaaya
 There was a long movement for the liberation of Goa
 antatah19 disambar 1961 ko bhartiya sena ne yahan akraman kar is kshetra ko portugali aadhipaty se mukt karavaaya or goa ko bharat main shaamil kar liya gaya
 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he

 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life

 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically

 In the same way, the knowledge enunciated in the Gita by Sri Krishna was even before Krishna, which is popular today as the Srimad Bhagavad Gita

 udanevaala spacketi daanav pastafaari dharm kaa ishwar he
 It was created in 2005 to protest the teaching of Intelligent Design and Creationism in US government schools
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although the followers of this religion call it a real religion, in the media it is seen as a satirical religion
 udanevaale spagetti daanav kaa pehla varnan 2005 main bobi henderson dwaara america ke kensas rajya ke shiksha board ko likhi gai ek vyangapurn chitthee main miltaa he
 With this letter, he was opposing the board's permission to teach intelligent design instead of evolution in science classes
 chitthee main ve spacketi or metbal kii tarah dikhne vaale devtaa or brahmand ke srujankarta main apni aasthaa jataa kar crieshnism kaa vyangy karte hai
 They argue that their assumptions are just as valid as the assumptions of intelligent design, and say that their assumptions should therefore have equal time with evolution and intelligent design in science classes
 apni lokapriyata or pahunch ke kaaran udanevaale spacketi daanav ko aksar rasal kii chaaydani ke samakaleen roopaantar kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki henderson ne kaha he ki "pastafaari dharm main ek hi dharm manyata kii anumati he – dharm manyataon kii naamanzoori", phir bhi pastafaari log kuch manyataayen rakhte hai
 According to the Pastafari creation myth, an invisible and inexplicable flying Spaghetti demon created the universe ten thousand years ago after drinking too much alcohol
 in manyataon ke anusaar prithvi ke trutipurna hone kaa kaaran is daanav kaa srijan ke dauraan nashe main chur hona he
 Pastafari also believes that all evidence of evolution was kept by the flying Spaghetti demon himself to test the reverence of the pastors

 Pasta Hell is similar, but beer is rancid and dancers have sexually transmitted diseases
 pastafaari manyataon ke anusaar samudri lutere vaastaviktaa main divya praani or mul pastafaari hai
 Pastafari believes that the notion of pirates being "thieves and ostracized" is the result of false information being spread by Christian theologians in the medieval period and today by the International Union of Krishna Consciousness
 inke anusaar, vaastaviktaa main samudri lutere "shanti-priy khoj yatri or sadbhaav ke prasarak" the jo bacchon ko mithaiyaan baantate the
 They say that today's pirates have nothing to do with "ancient lively pirates"
 iske atirikt, bermuda tribhuj se samudri or hawaii jahaajon ke rahasypurna dhang se gaayab hone ke liye pastafaari samudri luteron ke bhuton ko zimmedaar maanate hai

 Theory of repetition balak kisi pathyavastu athwa gyaan ko apane mastishk main thos prakaar se tabhi jamaa kar saktaa he jab baar-baar uski aavriti karaayi jaay
 Move from known to unknown balak ke purv gyaan se sambandhit karte hue yadi nayaa gyaan pradaan kiya jaataa he to balak ko use seekhney main ruchi va prerana praapt hoti he
 Man generally learns in this sequence
 isaliye adhyaaapak ko apni paathya saamagree is kram main prastut karnaa chaiye
 Move from simple to difficult pathyavastu ko is prakaar prasttut karnaa chaiye ki uske saral bhaagon kaa gyaan pehle karavaaya jaay tathaa dhire-dhire kathin bhaagon ko prastut kiya jaay

 baar-baar nirikshan va pareekshan se vah in kaarnon ko bhi jaan jaataa he
 That is, he moves from experience to logic
 balak ke anubhoot tathyon ko aadhaar banaakar dhire-dhire nirikshan va pareekshan dwaara unki tarkshakti kaa vikaas karne kaa praytn karnaa chaiye
 Move to the numerator balak ke sammukh uski samaj main aane yogyapurna vastu yaa tathy ko rakhana chaiye
 After this, one should move towards a detailed knowledge of its various parts
 yadi ek ped kaa gyaan pradaan karnaa he to pehle uskaa sampoorn chitra prastut kiya jaayegaa tathaa baad main uski jadon, pattiyon, falon aadi kaa parichay alag alag karavaaya jaayegaa

 a circle is a type of conic whose eccentricity is zero, that is, the constant is located at infinity in the plane
 ek vrutt ko ek vishesh prakaar ke dirghavritt ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jisamen donon nabhiyaan sampati hoti hai or utkendrata 0 hoti he
 Arc: Any part of the circumference of a circle
 centre: vrutt par sthit sabhi binduon se samdurastha bindu
 Chord: a line segment, formed when any two points on a circle meet
 ek jeeva vrutt ko do vruttkhandon main vibhajit karti he
 Circumference: The curve length around the circle
 vyas: ek rekhakhand jiske antabindu vrutt par sthit hote hai or jo centre se gujarata he yaa vrutt ke kinhin do binduon ke bich kii adhiktam duuri he
 It is the largest chord of the circle and it is twice the radius
 discs: ek vrutt se ghira antah samatleey kshetra
 Radius: a line segment from the center of the circle to any point in the circumference of the circle, which is half of the diameter
 trigyakhand: kinhin do trigyaon ke bich ek chaap se ghira kshetra
 Segment: a region without center surrounded by a chord of the circle and an arc
 ek jeeva vrutt ko do vruttkhandon main vibhajit karti he
 Perforated Line: An extended chord, which is the plane of the circle and intersects the circle at two points
 ardhvrutt: vrutt ke vyas tathaa vyas ke antabinduon se bane chaap ke madhya kaa kshetra ardhvrutt hota he
 The area of a semicircle is half of the entire area of the circle
 sparshi: vrutt ke samatleey sidhi rekha jo ek bindu par vrutt ko sparsh karti he
 According to Euclid, 'ek vrutt ek rekha se ghira hua ekavimiya samtal hota he or kisi nishchit bindu se lekar us bandharekha tak khinchi gai sabhi rekhaaen baraabar hoti hai
 This bond is called the circumference and this fixed point is the center of the circle
 ' The line intersecting the circumference of a circle at two points is called the intersecting line of that circle
 vrutt kii paridhi ko kisi ek bindu par sparsh karne vaali rekha ko us vrutt kii sparsh rekha kehete hai
 Circumference length vrutt kii paridhi tathaa uske vyas kaa anupaat π hota he, jiskaa maan lagbhag 3
141592654 ke baraabar he
 Thus the length of circumference is related to C, radius r and diameter d as follows: c = 2πr = πd Area: archimedes ne vrutt ke kshetrafal maapan main siddh kiya ki ek vrutt se ghira kshetra ek tribhuj ke kshetrafal ke baraabar he, jiskaa aadhaar vrutt kii paridhi kii lambaai ke baraabar or isaki oonchai vrutt kii trigya ke baraabar hoti he
 The product of the square of π and radius is equal to the area of the circle
 kshetrafal = πr2 If the diameter of the circle is d, then kshetrafal = / 4 = 0
7854d2 This is equal to about 79% of the area of the square whose length is d
 sameekaran: In an xy Cartesian coordinate system, the equation of the circle of center and radius r 2 + 2 = r2 If the center of the circle is the radius and the radius r, then the equation of the circle: x2 + y2 = r2 Katri is a village in Kurnulu district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India

 Anemia or hypoglycemia is the medical term for the condition of blood sugar formation in levels below normal

 Anemia can be treated by ingesting glucose or operating in the body and normalizing carbohydrate dietary blood-sugar levels

 Recurrent hemorrhage can be counteracted only by adversely or removing underlying causes, increasing the frequency of diet, drug treatment such as diazoxide, octreotide or glucocorticoids, or by removing most of the pancreas by surgery

 Glucose levels in the fasting state are 70 mg / dl in most healthy adults, and symptoms of anemia begin to develop when glucose levels reach 55 mg / dl

 Sometimes it becomes difficult to determine whether the symptoms of a person's disease are due to blood pressure
 raktasharkaraalpata ke rog-nirdhaarit ke vihpal ke trayee ke maandand kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Generally, anemia is a terminology in popular culture and alternative medicine for the common people, often by self-examination, vibration, instability and changes in mind and thinking, but without measuring low levels of sugar or without risky damage
 Diet is practiced by changing the practice

 To define anemia, the exact level of glucose is considered low depending on the measurement method, the age of the person, the presence or absence of effects, and the purpose of the definition
 jabaki raktasharkara kii saamaanya seemaa ko lekar koi asahmati nahin he phir bhi is bare main bahes jari he ki raktasharkaraalpata kis degree par chikitsakeey moolyankan yaa upachaar, ko nyaaysangat yaa pramanik tehraati he athwa nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he
 Blood sugar concentrations are expressed as milligrams per deciliter in the United States, Japan, Spain, France, Belgium, Egypt, and Colombia, while millimoles per liter in the rest of the world

 This difference in arterial and venous levels in the fasting phase is small, but in the post-meal phase it can be increased by more than 10%
 duusari ore, puri kii puri raktasharkara ke str shiraparak plavika staron se lagbhag 10%-15% tak kam hote hai
 Furthermore, the available fingerstick glucose meter justifies the accuracy of up to only 15% of the laboratory's one-time evaluation

 vah ek vyakti jisaki prayogshaala main serumglucose 53 mg / dl tha; yahaan tak ki "real world" ke gharelu upyog main bhi vyapak ghatbad ghatit ho sakate hai
 There are two other important components that affect the measurement of glucose: hematocrit and delay in measurement after taking blood
 Venous and total blood concentrations are higher when hematocrit is elevated, as in newborns or adults with polycythemia
 High neonatal hematocrit, in particular, renders the measurement of glucose by meter almost inaccurate
 doosraa kaarak yah he ki, jabatak namoonay ko fluoride tub main khinchakar nahin liya jaataa he athwa koshikaon se serum yaa plasma ko alag karne ke liye tatkaal sansaghit nahin kiya jaataa he, maapne yogya glucose lagbhag 7 mg / dl / hr pratighante kii dar se dhire-dhire parakhnalee main niyantrit parivesh main chayapachay ke dwaara kamata chalaa jayega, yaa isse bhi adhik rakt main shevtanuvriddhi kii upasthiti ke dwaara

 As the fasting period increases, a high percentage of infants and children will have glucose plasma levels below light, usually without symptoms
 The extent of normal blood glucose levels in newborns should be debated
 yah prastaav pesh kiya gaya he ki, navjaat mastishk vaikalpik indhan kaa upyog karne main vayaskon kii tulana main tatparta se sakasham ho jate hai jab glucose ke str main giravat aa jaati he
 There is debate among experts regarding the importance and risk of such levels, although experts are inclined to recommend maintaining glucose levels as high as 60–70 mg / dl on the first day immediately after birth
 swasth vayaskon main anusandhan se pataa chalata he ki maansik kshamta main thodi-si giravat aati he lekin kai logon main kuch had tak raktasharkara 65 mg / dl tak neeche utar jaati he
 Hormone-protected defense mechanisms are normally activated as it falls below the level of the threshold for most people, causing peculiar hemorrhagic symptoms of tremor, instability and nervousness and restless mental depression

 Since the effect of hemorrhage on the brain, which is named neuroglycopenia, determines whether a given low glucose is a "problem" for that person, most doctors use the term hypoglycaemia only when ajab is commonly used in glucose
 Symptoms or effects on the brain begin to be reflected simultaneously with lower levels
 is paribhaasha ke donon bhaagon kii upasthiti kaa nirdhaaran sarvada sidhaa-sidhaa hi nahin hota, kyonki raktasharkaraalpata janit lakshan or prabhaav aspasht hote hai evam anya paristhitiyon se bhi paidaa ho sakate hai; aise log jinamein glucose kaa str baar-baar kam ho jaataa he, ve apni seemaa rekha ke lakshanon ko kho sakate hai taaki gambhir neuroglaicopanic aakshamata bina kisi lakshanik chetavanee ke unamem aa sakati he tathaa kai parimaapan paddatiyaan nimna str par galat hote hai
 Diabetes hemolytic anemia is a particular type of disease in relation to the measured glucose and hemolytic anemia due to several reasons
 sarvapratham, gharelu glucose meter kii reeding aksar bhraamak paathyank suchit karti he, yah bhi sambhaavna he ki kam paathyank, lakshanon ke saath ho yaa na ho, jo vaastavik raktasharkaraalpata suchit karti he, yah bhi sambhaavna he ki kam paathyank, lakshanon ke saath ho yaa na ho, jo vaastavik raktasharkaraalpata suchit karti he vah us vyakti vishesh main adhik ucchtar hota he jo insulin na lene vaale kii tulana main insulin letaa he
 Second, since the "flow of insulin" injected via injection cannot be prevented, diabetic hemorrhage is more likely to develop severe physiologic impairment, if left untreated, than most other forms of hemorrhage
 Third, since glucose levels are often above normal in people with diabetes for long periods, symptoms of hemorrhage may sometimes show up to a higher threshold than those whose blood sugar is usually normal
 in sabhi kaarnon se ucchtar, meter glucose kii seemaa rekha ko aksar madhumeh se peedit logon main "hypoglichemic" samajha jaataa he
 For all the reasons explained in the above paragraphs, it is not always easy to determine whether the prevalence of blood pressure threshold is 45–75 mg / dl of medically problematic hemorrhage

 Due to the above statistical and scalable variations, the Androcaine Society recommends that the diagnosis of hemorrhage should be as a problem for a particular individual based on a combination of low levels of glucose and evidence of adverse effects

 Not all of the above manifestations appear in every case of hypoglycaemia

 There are variations in specific manifestations according to age, severity of hypoglycaemia and speed of deterioration
 kishoron main, kabhi-kabhi subah-subah hi amlarkatta ke saath hypoglicami main vaman hote hai
 In older children and adults, mania and mental illness in general are associated with drug intoxication, or drunkenness, with severe hypoglycaemia
 bujurgon main, hypoglicami raktaghaat athwa dil kaa daura padane jaisaa yaa phir aisa jisaki vyakhya karnaa behad mushkil he, aisi bechaini ko janm de sakati he
 From one episode to another, a person can have similar symptoms from one episode to another, but it may not necessarily continue to happen and may also be influenced by the intensity of the speed of landing below the sugar level, as well
 Even from the last incident

 In insulin-dependent diabetic patients, this type of phenomenon is called ignorance of hemolytic anemia and becomes an important clinical problem when efforts are made to control advanced hemorrhage

 Almost invariably, anemia can be so severe that it can cause backward seizures or convulsions without causing any obvious damage to the brain

 Therefore, if the amount of sugar supplied by the blood suddenly decreases, then the brain is the first in the affected parts

 Deformity often becomes evident below 40 mg / dl due to reactivity and correct decision making
 agar sharkara kaa str isse bhi neeche utar jaataa he to daure padane kii sambhaavna ho jaati he
 As blood pressure levels drop below 10 mg / dl, most neurons are legitimately silent and inactive leading to unconscious states
 mastishk par ke in prabhaavon ko samuhik rup se neuroglacopinia kehete hai
 Adequate supply of sugars to the brain is clearly reflected in the response to a decline in glucose levels in the number of nerves, hormones and metabolism

 One of the mentioned examples of anemia can cause permanent brain damage that is difficult to predict, and depends on a number of factors such as age, recent blood and low blood sugar
 Experiences, concurrent problems such as availability
 The vast majority of symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes result in detectable permanent damage

 Under these circumstances, the age of the patient, the time of day, the time elapsed after the last meal taken, the previous episode, nutritional status, physical and mental development, drugs or toxic substances, other body systems, family history , And response to treatment
 In this condition, when a haemorrhage occurs repeatedly, a record or "diary" of several months in which the circumstances of each table can be useful in determining the nature and cause of haematosis

 When a person is not unconscious, carbohydrate failure causes the symptoms to become unfavorable within 10 to 15 minutes, leading to the possibility that hemorrhage may not be the cause of the symptoms
 When hemorrhage remains constant in a hospitalized patient, the mere amount of sugar required to maintain levels of satisfactory hemorrhage becomes an important clue to the underlying cause of the disease and the origin of the disease

 Perhaps the most common inadequacy of the emergency department in cases of unexplained hemorrhage is the failure to obtain at least the original sample before glucose delivery to reverse the condition
 mahatvapurn namoonay ke bas ek ansh kaa moolyankan hi yah pramanit karne ke liye kaaphi he ki rog ke lakshan raktasharkaraalpata ke kaaran hai
 Most often, measurements of hormones and metabolites at the time of hemorrhage indicate that which organ-specific and physiological functions of the body are properly reactive and which of them are acting abnormally
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab raktasharkara kaa str kam ho jaataa he, sharkara badhaane vaale hormonon ko or bhi upar uthaanaa chahie tathaa insulin ke srav ko puri tarah dabaa diya janaa chahie
 The following is a brief list of hormones and metabolites that can be measured in important samples
 prayek rogi par sabhi prakaar ke parikshan nahin kiye jate hai

 If it is uncertain whether hemorrhage actually causes seizures, some physicians will recommend the use of a household glucose meter to confirm that the narrative glucose level is low at the particular time when the seizures occur
 jab daure baraabar padane lage athwa rogi / rogini ko yah mahasoos hone lage ki uskaa sir daure padane se pehle chakkar kha rahaa he to aisi sthiti main yah padyati sabase upyogi ho sakati he
 The biggest drawback of this method is the fact that this false positive high rate or imprecision in the meters available at the present time is a reflection of bipartite levels: it is necessary for the doctor and patient charities to use the exact same item which is disappointing and Indecisive magnitudes can be avoided
 gambhir lakshan ke saath aavartak raktasharkaraalpata ke maamalon main, sangeen halaaton ko chhodkar sabase acchhee vidhi aksar naidanik upwas he
 It is usually managed in the hospital and the duration of the test depends on the patient's age and fasting response

 The purpose of fasting is to determine whether people can maintain their blood sugar levels normal for long periods of time and react to fasting with appropriate changes of metabolism
 upwas ke ant main insulin kii suraag lagbhag nahin milani chahie tathaa kitosis ko puri tarah sthapit kiya janaa chahie
 The blood pressure level of the patient is monitored and an important sample is made available if the sugar level drops

 The traditional method of testing for suspected hemorrhage is an oral tolerance test of glucose, especially for 3,4 or 5 hours
 haalanki 1960 ke dashakon main sanyukt rajya main kaaphi lokapriy rahaa, phir bhi baar-baar ke shodh adhyayanon ne yah pramanit kiya ki deergh parikshan kii avadhi main kai swasth logon main sharkara kaa str 70 yaa 60 se neeche ho jate he, evam kai prakaar kii mahatvapurn raktasharkaraalpata kaa pataa nahin chal pataa he
 As a result of this combination of poor sensitivity and specificity, physicians felt that this test should be abandoned for glucose metabolism disorders
 raktasharkaraalpata ko vargeekrut karne ke kai tareeke hai
 The following common causes and factors mentioned can contribute to hemorrhage based on age-grouped basis, as well as some factors that may be relatively independent of the age range classification

 Surgically removing the superfluous portion of the pancreas is curative with low risk when high honeycomb is the main focus or due to benign insulin-producing tumors of the pancreas

 Including fat and protein along with carbohydrates can slow down digestion and reduce insulin secretion early
 isamen kuch aise prakaar hai jo glucosides avarohak se upachaar par aisi pratikriya pradarshit karti he, jo starch ke pachan ko dhimaa kar detii he
 Evidently reactive hemorrhage with low levels of hemorrhage is often a predictive problem, which can be alleviated by consuming fat and protein in the morning breakfast or with a snack in the afternoon, and by lowering the amount of alcohol

 Blood pressure levels can be elevated to normal within minutes by taking 10-20 grams of carbohydrate
 agar vyakti hosh main ho tathaa nigalane main sakasham ho to vah ise aahaar ke rup athwa peya ke rup main le saktaa he
 This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 3-4 ounces of orange juice, or grape juice, although fruit juices have a higher ratio of fruit sugars that are markedly more slowly than pure vinegar sugars, as an alternative
 From about 4-5 ounces regular soda can be as effective as a slice of bread, filled with about 4 biscuits or starch, which is one of the masses
 The starch is not easily digested and converted into sugars, or should be judged that anything is fed to them through the mouth, medical personnel such as emts and physicians, or hospital staff can give vein-glucose to the IV system
