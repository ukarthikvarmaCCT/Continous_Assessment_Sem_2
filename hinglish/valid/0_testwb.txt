com / disabled-day-special-story / Nomination Process: giriganga upatyaka himachal pradesh ke teen janapadon shimla, solan or sirmaur main faili he, or giri nadi inke adhikansh bhaagon se jalgrahan kar yamuna main daalati he
 The people of these areas call the Giri river as Giriganga
 giriganga kaa jalgrahan kshetra 2,63,861
86 hectare main rajban, uttaranchal or himachal kii seemaa par yamuna se shimla janapad ke jubbal kasbe ke upar kupad parvat tak failaa he
 Giriganga is situated about 5 kilometers from a place called khad-pathar, 80 km from Shimla on the jubbal-rohdu National Road
 shimla janapad main kupad parvat se nikal kar giriganga dakshin-pashchim disha main 40 kilometre kii duuri tay kar, solan ke paas se purab disha kii ore 88 kilometre kii yatra ke baad rampur ghat main yamuna nadi main milti he
 In this journey, this river forms the Giriganga Upatyaka, here four important aspects, mythological, historical, biological and ecological, are mentioned
 giriganga ke udgam va namakaran se judi puranic katha is prakaar he
 From Jubbal, a sage came to austerity on the hill of Kupad at the distance of a plan
 uske paas ek tumbe main gangaajal tha
 Suddenly he collapses
 us muni ke mukh se yah vachan nikle, ki he gange agar taine mere paatr se is tibbe par girnaa kabool kiya, tu giri he to giriganga naam se hameshaa bahati raho
 Later in this delightful Vanasthali, King Karma Chandra of Jubbal greeted Giriganga by making a tank, and in the middle of it installed a statue of Sri Giriganga in a grand temple
 giriganga ke udgam sthal ke nikat bane mandir logon kii aasthaa ke pratik hai, mukhyatah yahan log baisakhi ke din snaan karne aate hai
 There is also a pilgrimage site in Maipul of Theog where people around it take a bath in Giriganga on the holy festival of Baisakhi
 bhor main yahan ke bhooteshwar devtaa snaan karte hai, or baad main yah sthal sabhi logon ke snaan ke liye khul jaataa he
 Similarly, in Balag, 65 km from Shimla, on the banks of Giriganga, there are ancient temples built in the Nagara style
 logon main vishwaas he ki in mandiron kaa nimarn pandavon ne kiya tha
 Renuka, who is also a sanctuary, is linked to Parshu Ram and his mother Renuka by mythology
 logon main manyata he ki vaidic kaal main jamadagni rishi apni patni renuka ke saath yahan jhil ke kinare rahete the
 Parshu Ram is brought in a palanquin from Jamu village, 9 km from here in Kartik month, then after bathing in Giriganga brings him to Renuka lake with other gods, where he is reunited with his mother Renuka
 giriganga ke mandir jubbal ke raja karm chandra ne banaaye the, or inkaa nirmaan san 1854 ke ek-do dashak baad, jab karm chandra ko rani victoria ke aadesh se jubbal kii rajgaddi mili, hua hoga
 Although the 1910 Gazetteer of the hill princely states of Shimla has the name of King Padam Chandra of Jubbal in the construction of these temples, but the pedigree of Padam Chandra and the book of Mian Gobardhan Singh, both describe four temples in Giriganga, whose builder Padma Chandra's father is Karma Chandra
 pehla mandir pattharon kii chinai se banaaye gaye talab ke bich main sthit he or isamen ganga kii murti sthapit he
 The water of Giriganga falls from one side to the pond with the head of an animal carved on the stone
 iske thik peeche do chote-chote mandir hai, ek shiv kaa tathaa doosraa vishnu kaa
 a fourth temple is of Kali, which is built on the mound some distance away from these
 moraan ke anusaar kisi samay mogul shashan kaal main giriganga upatyaka kaa adhikansh bhaag sirmaur riyasat main tha, or kaalsi isaki rajdhani thi
 He further writes that in 1610 strengthening his kingdom in the Giri Upatika, the king of Sirmour chose this region of the lowland of Giri, where the river Tounas joins the Yamuna
 miyaan gobardhan singh likhte hai ki sirmaur ke raja udit prakaash ne kaalsi ko apni rajdhani chunaa, jahaan ashok kaa shila lekh bhi he
 According to historian Laxman Thakur, the Nagara style would extend from near Kalsi in the Yamuna Valley to the Giriganga Upatika, examples of which are the temples of Giriganga and Balag
 ajay bahadur singh likhte hai ki mogul badshaah aurangzeb ke samay raja buddha prakaash, jinhone sirmaur par 1659 se 1678 tak raaj kiya, naahan se baraf dilli bhejte the or unhen barfi raja ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Not only this, he also sent many varieties of herbs, honey, musk, and monal etc
 to Jahanara from this region
 or unhone badshaah aurangzeb se guhaar lagaai thi ki kaalsi ko gadhwal ke raja se waapas lene main unki sahayata kii jaye
 The exploitation of the Himalayan organic wealth, especially forests, began during the British rule, which led to the economic prosperity of the hill states, such as Jubbal, whose Giriganga Ascension Site, and Sirmaur, which occupied most of the Giriganga upland
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad bhi himalay ke wanon kaa dohan kam nahin hua
 Singh, Kothari and Pandey have described animals and ecology in detail in the three sanctuaries of the Giriganga Upatika, Chudhar, Chail and Simbalwara
 unka kahana he ki churdhaar abhayaarany giriganga ke udgam ke paas kaa kshetra he, jo wanon se achchhadit he
 Himalayan art bears, leopard, Hanuman langur, Rahesus monkey, Indian porcupine, Kakad, and Ghorl are the main animals in this region
 kasturi mrug, jo is kshetra main bahutayat main paaya jaataa tha ab shaayad nahin ke baraabar he
 The Chail Sanctuary also forms the core of the catchment area of giriganga and is covered with forests of Ban, Chir and Cedar
 isamen paae jane vaale jantu evam vanaspati churdhaar se milte julate hai
 The Simbalwara Sanctuary is an area around the confluence of the Yamuna of Giriganga with sal forests that will be dense at times, but has now changed due to the dense population
 is abhayaarany main sher, tendua, hanuman langur, rahesus bandar, kakad, chital, or sambar paae jate hai
 The authors believe that elephants also used to come to Simbalwara
 kaulet ne fallora simlensis main giriganga upatyaka kii vanaspati kaa varnan kiya he, jiske parichay main rayel batenic garden ke hemsle likhte hai ki chur is kshetra main 12000 foot oonchi choti he jiskaa is pustak main baar-baar naam aata he
 Further information about the animals of this region is in the list made by Sharma and Sidhu
 giriganga ke puranic swarup ko dehara doon ke lok vigyaan santhaan ne, kashyap ke jal upyog or sangrakshan ke disha-nirdeshon se jodate hue, anek aisi puranic kathaon ke sandarbh main rakhaa he jo is jalaagam ke paristhitikeey mahatv ko ujagar karti he
 One aspect of the snowfall in the mountains, which was only mentioned in the context of the Mughal period, is associated with water
 paryaavarnavid sundarlal bahuguna is baat ko jan-jan tak le gaye ki pahaado main wanon kaa ghatana, baraf ke jamaav main kami, tathaa bha-ksharan aapas main jude hai
 According to Vijay Mishra's interpretation, the rapid velocity of the drops of water falling from the sky connected Valmiki to the rapid velocity of the Ganges, and compared the covered forests of the Himalayas to the jatas of Shiva
 anek prakaar ke jeev-jantuon kaa varnan bhi valmiki ne apni katha main kiya he
 Not only this, but also took him to Patala, for which he added the plot of the liberation of Sagar's 60,000 dead sons and the penance of Bhagiratha
 giriganga upatyaka, himalay kaa sabase nikatavarti jalgrahan kshetra he, jo sthaneey logon kii jal kii aapurti hi nahin karata balki bharat kii rajdhani dilli kii pani kii aapurti se bhi judaa he
 a small part of this catchment area was identified by the British in the 19th century to meet the water requirements in Shimla
 baad main ise shimla jal grahan abhayaarany ke rup main viksit kiya gaya, or aaj bhi deodara ke ghaney van se dhakaa yah kshetra shimla ke liye svachh pani kaa sabase bada strot he, jabaki anya strot pradooshan kii chapet main aate rahete hai
 Many multi-purpose hydroelectric schemes have been made in the Giri river, in which water from Giri, Bata and Jalal is being used
 giriganga upatyaka himachal pradesh ke shimla, solan or sirmaur jilon kii samskruti kaa hissaa he
 The exploitation of the Himalayan forests, which began during the British rule, intensified after the independence of India, which has emerged as a confrontation of environment and development
 yah takaraav giriganga ke udgam sthal ke aas-paas bhi saamne aayaa he, jahaan wanon kaa kaaphi hissaa seb ke baghichon main badal diya gaya
 Madhav Gadgil has put the issue of such a change in the ecology of Western Ghats of India before the public
 van anusandhan se jude vaigyanikon kii khoj bataati he ki giriganga ke udgam sthal ke mishrit wanon main deodar, cyle, rajat talishpatr, prasaral, mauru or kharshu ke vriksh hai
 These forests are extremely important for soil organic carbon harvesting
 arthath yah mishrit van, anya wanon kii apeksha, carbon ko vayumandal main jane se rokane main sabase adhik yogadan dete hai, jo global varming ko kam karne ke liye zaruri he
 Today all the countries of the world are grappling with the problems of increase in temperature and change in weather
 vayumandal main badhate tapakram or isse hone vaale mausam main badlaav kaa manushya ke jivan par hanikaarak prabhaav sabhi ke liye chintaa kii baat he, ise dhyaan main rakhkar vishwa ke sabhi desh 2015 main paris main mili or kai samjhauton ke prastaavon par hastakshar kiye, ek samuhik uddeshy rakhaa ki prithvi ke tapakram ko audyogikaran se pehle ke str par laana he
 In this context, the increasing amount of carbon in the atmosphere is a major component, as it increases the temperature around the Earth
 ise kam karne kaa ek rasta he carbon ko jameen main bhandar karke rakhaa jaye
 Only certain ecological systems contribute to this, which is at the origin of Giriganga
 kintu ab isamen seb ke bagiche fail gaye hai
 In the opinion of the jurists, the encroachment of forest area by the villagers around the Giriganga Ascension site, and in other areas of Himachal, is not correct, and they have ordered the removal of illegitimate possession
 duusari ore, paryaavaran kii sanstha se jude kuch log himachal main vanabhoomi par atikaraman ke prati samvedansheel rukh apnaane or is samasya ke sheeghra samaadhaan ke pakshdhar hai
 In this context, farmer leader Rakesh Singha spoke of ignoring the interests of small and poor gardeners, and suggested an alternative system
 felics pedal ne wanon ke nazadik yaa wanon par ashrith logon, jaise madhya bharat ke dongariyaa kaundh, ke liye vaikalpik vikaas ko chunauti mana he
 The British have also described this around the Ascension site of Giriganga, especially from the village of Pundar Pargana, which is self-respecting and hardworking
 sharma ne is aitihaasik prasang ke bare main jaankaree dete hue likhaa ki gorakhon ke netaa amar singh thapa ne 1910 main is kshetra ke gaavon, madaog, jubbad, ghadeen, maatal, bamata, mamavi, kashah, aadi ko luutane kii khuli chhot di thi, par in gaanvvaalon ne gorkha sena kaa muqabla kiya
 These people have been deprived of development for a long time
 paris samjhaute main is baat ko sweekaar kiya gaya he ki vikasshil deshon ke samudaayon, jo paryaavaran sangrakshan se prabhavit hote hai, ke liye vikaas ke vaikalpik raste khoje jaaen
 Such problems need to be resolved

 Devendranath Thakur was a Hindu philosopher, Brahmasamaji and Dharma reformer
 1848 main brahm samaaj ke sansthaapakon main se ek the
 Devendranath Thakur was born in 1818 in Bengal
 inaki shiksha-diksha hindu college main hui jahaan sanshaywad kaa paath padhaayaa jaataa tha or uski prashansa hoti thi
 He was raised in immense wealth and wealth
 22 varsh kii avasthaa main inhone 'tatvabodhini sabha' sthapit kii
 Its main aim was to teach people the lesson of 'brahmadharma'
 is sabha ne moulik shastron ko jaanane tathaa vartmaan samay tak unamem kiye gaye parivartanon ke sambadh main gyaan praapt karne kaa nishchay kiya
 It created a tradition of morality
 dhire dhire devendranath kii yah sabha lokapriy hone lagi or kuch prabhaavshaalee hindu iske sadsy ban gaye
 Every week it had a meeting in which Bhagavadbhajan and discourses were held
 san 1842 main devendranath ne brahmsamaj main padaarpan kiya
 The Brahmo Samaj began to collapse after King Rammohan Roy left for England
 samaaj main prati saptaah naanaa prakaar ke log ekatrit hote the or bhajan pravachan sunakar chale jate the
 Nothing more than this
 devendranath ke brahmsamaj main aa jane se usamen nayaa jivan aa gaya
 In 1847, he introduced the Tatvabodhini Sabha with a pledge
 is pratigya main yah kaha jaataa tha ki brahmsamaj kaa prayek sadsy bure kaaryon se bachaa rahegaa, sachche hriday se bhagwaan kii puja karegaa or paariwarik prasannataa ke avasar par brahmsamaj ko kuch bhent degaa
 Devendranath was the first to sign this pledge
 brahmsamaj kii baithkon main ab bhi vedon tathaa upanishdon kaa paath hota, banglaa main koi upadesh hota tathaa sab log milakar koi banglaa mantra athwa bhajan gaate
 In the same year, Devendranath started a monthly magazine which has been labeled as 'tatvabodhini Patrika'
 samaaj kii baithkon ke liye ek bada sa sthaan uplabdh ho gaya or uski sadsysankhya badhane lagi
 Branches of Brahmasama opened up all over the place soon
 kuch navayuvakon ne brahmsamaj main pravesh kiya
 Gradually, members began to have differences among themselves on various subjects
 kuch logon kaa yah kahana tha ki vedon ko sahi margpradarshak maanane ke sambandh main kabhi unka nirikshan nahin kiya gaya
 Devendranath accepted this and sent him to Banaras in 1845 to study the four Vedas and make a copy of each Veda
 do varsh adhyayan kane ke uparaant jab ye brahman vedon kii pratilipi lekar kalakatta pahunche, in pratilipiyon kaa nirikshan kiya gaya
 There was then a long debate in this regard, at the end of which it was decided that neither the Vedas nor the Upanishads can be considered true guides in the true sense
 in granthon ke keval kuch vichaar tathaa nitivakya hi sweekaarya hai
 In 1850, Devendranath published an article titled 'brahmadharma' in Sanskrit and Bengali
 is lekh main 'eko brahm dwitiyao naasti' kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya
 All this glory is of that Brahman
 vah ajar, amar, nirgun aadi anek gunon se sampann tathaa sarvajna he
 Only by worshiping him is worldly and spiritual skill possible
 uske prati premasahit adarbhav hona tathaa uske icchaanusaar kaary karnaa hi brahm kii puja he
 The religious system propounded in 'brahmadharma' was mainly based on the Upanishads
 usamen kuch nae vichaar tathaa hindoodharm ke kuch lokapriy siddhant bhi sammilit kar liye gaye the
 a new member of the Brahmasamaj was Keshav Chandra Sen
 keshav ke kuch anuyaayiyon ne brahmavaad ke prachaar ke liye apana sara samay brahmsamaj ko arpit kar diya
 These people roamed all over Bengal and started giving their message
 keshav swayan bhi isi sambandh main madras tathaa bombai gaye
 The result of these efforts was that by the end of 1865, 54 branches of Brahmajamas were opened in Bengal, Punjab, Madras and North West Provinces
 devendranath, keshav tathaa anya navayuvakon ke is kaary se bade prasann hue
 But soon Maharishi Devendranath became dissatisfied with the progressive thoughts of Keshav Chandra Sen's widow marriage and inter-caste marriage
 is prakaar san 1865 main hi brahmsamaj main foot pad gai or usamen do vichaardhaaraen ho gayi
 Devendranath removed Keshav Chandra Sen and his companions
 isapar keshavchand ne 'bhartiya brahmsamaj' kii sthapana kii
 The society of Devendranath and his companions now began to be called 'adisamaj'
 'adisamaj' kisi bhi prakaar ke prachaarkarya tathaa samajasudhar se dur hi rahaa or akeshwarwad main vishwaas rakhata rahaa
 The reputation of Adisamaj continued for some time due to the personal influence of Devendranath Thakur
 iske baad maharishi devendranath ne samaaj ke kaary ko ek prabandhak samiti ke haath main saunp diya
 In a short time, people forgot the Adi Brahmas Samaj
 dadasaheb chintamani pavate ko sahitya evam shiksha ke kshetra main bharat sarkaar dwaara san 1967 main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 They are from the state of Karnataka
 2789 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year of the year 2789 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2789 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 gorakhnath yaa gorakshnath ji maharaj pratham shatabdi ke purv nath yogi ke the guru gorakhnath ji ne puure bharat kaa bhraman kiya or anekon granthon kii rachana kii
 Gorakhnath's temple is located in Gorakhpur city of Uttar Pradesh
 gorakhnath ke naam par is jile kaa naam gorakhpur padaa he
 The Gurkhas of Nepal got the name only after the name of Guru Gorakhnath
 nepal main ek jila he gorkha, us jile kaa naam gorkha bhi inhi ke naam se padaa
 It is believed that Guru Gorakhnath first appeared here
 gorkha jila main ek gupha he jahaan gorakhnath kaa pag chinh he or unki ek murti bhi he
 Every year, Vaishakha Purnima is a festival called 'rot Mahotsav' and a fair is also held here
 dow badthwaal kii khoj main nimnlikhit 40 pustakon kaa pataa chalaa tha, jinhen gorakhnath-rachit bataaya jaataa he
 Dr
 Baratwal, after much investigation, considered the first 14 texts among them as indeterminately ancient, as they are mentioned in almost all copies
 terahavin pustak ‘gyaan chauntisa’ samay par na mil sakane ke kaaran unke dwaara sampadit sangrah main nahin aa saki, parantu baaki teraa ko gorakhnath kii rachanaayen samajhakar us sangrah main unhone prakashit kar diya he
 The books are matsyendranath or gorakhnath ke samay ke bare main bharat main anek vidwaanon ne anek prakaar kii baaten kahi hai
 In fact, many stories are popular about him and his contemporary Jalandharnath and Krishnapada
 gorakhnath or matsyendranath-vishyak samast kahaniyon ke anushilan se kai baaten spasht rup se jaani ja sakati hai
 First, that Matsyendranath and Jalandharnath were contemporary; Secondly, Matsyendranath was the Guru of Gorakhnath and Jalandharnath was the Guru of Kanupa or Krishnapada; Thirdly, that Matsyendranath was once the originator of the yog-marg, then incidentally got involved in an ethos in which uninterrupted association with women was the main thing - possibly it was the Vamachari Sadhana; - fourth, that from the very beginning, the cultivation of Jalandhar Nath and Kanipa - The method was different from the practice of Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath
 yah spasht he ki kisi ek kaa samay bhi maaloom ho to baaki sidhon ke samay kaa pataa asaani se lag jayega
 Several tips can be given to find the time
 ek-ek karke ham un par vichaar karen
 Historical persons associated with these legends are known for a long time
 bahut-se aitihaasik vyakti gorakhnath ke saakshaat shishy maane jate hai
 Gorakhnath's time can also be estimated with the help of his time
 brigs ne in dantakthaon par aadhaarit kaal or chaar mote vibhaagon main is prakaar baant liya he- But based on the above evidences, the time of the Nath Marg promoters etc
 seems to be the middle part of the ninth century
 is maarg main purvavarti siddh bhi baad main chalakar antarbhukt hue hai or isliye gorakhnath ke sambandh main aisi darjanon dantakathaayen chal padi hai, jinako aitihaasik tathy maan lene par tithi-sambandhi jhamela khadaa ho jaataa he

 He became the servant of King Chandal, wearing the truth and took the clothes of the dead

 Many times the king drowned in the sea of anxiety and thought in his mind that where should i go, what should i do, so that i can be saved
 is prakaar raja ko kai varsh biit gaye
 One day the king was sitting in the same concern that Gautam Rishi came
 raja ne unhen dekhakar pranaam kiya or apni sari du:khabhari kahani kah sunai
 On hearing this, Gautam Rishi said that Rajan will come to your luck seven days from today, Ekadashi of the Bhadrapad Krishna Paksha will come, you do it fast
 gautam rishi ne kaha ki is vrath ke punya prabhaav se tumhaare samast paap nasht ho jaayenge
