 In 2005 Kim Walen of Emory University wrote, "I think the question of 'nature vs

" " walen ne likhaa he ki ling bhed bahut jaldi ubhar kar aata he or purushon or mahilaon kii apni gatividhiyon main antarnihit variyata ke jariye tay hota he
 Girls carry toys and other items they love, while more likely that boys "do all they can or have to do efficiently
" " According to Wallen, despite this, expectations will not play a role in how girls perform
 For example, if women who are proficient in mathematics are told that this test is "gender neutral", they can score higher, but if they are told that men have done better than women in the past, women will perform worse
 Wallen has said, "what is strange," according to the research, everyone obviously has to say to a woman who has been weak in mathematics in social life so far that the math test is gender neutral and will show that all the effects of socialization "judging by their genetic contribution, the impact of parental nutrition is less prolonged than other aspects of the environment, such as the peer group of children," said author Judith Harris

 When Marquis's carriage moves, Defarge throws the coin back into the cart, which causes Marquis to become angry

 He argues: Darnay sympathizes with the farmers while Marquis is cruel and ruthless: "daman hi ekmaatr sthaayee darshan he

 At some work, Miss Pross is surprised to see her missing brother, Salomon Pross, but Pross does not want her to be recognized
 Suddenly Sydney Carton appears and identifies the Solomon Pross as John Barsad, one of the men who tried to implicate Darnay for treason in the first trial in London
 carton dhamkee detaa he ki vah solaaman kii shinaakht apni suvidhanusaar frans yaa britain ke liye jasusi karne vaale ek angrez or mauqaaprast ke rup main kar degaa

 The only information in the plot that could generate any sympathy for Madame Defarge is that her family has been lost and that she has no name
 "difaarge" uski shaadi ke baad kaa naam he or dow manet ko uske parivaar kaa naam nahin pataa chal paata yadhyapi vah uski mar rahi bahan se poochta he

 aisa vah lusi ke pyaar kii khatir, use pehle die gaye apane vaade ko yaad karke karata he
 Following Carton's first instructions, Darnay's family and Laurie flee Paris and France with an unconscious man in the park holding Carton's identity card but actually Darnay

 The novel concludes with guillotining Sydney Carton
 carton ke antim vichaar bhavishyavaanee karte hai: carton ko dikhaai de jaataa he ki difaarge, barsaad or da vengence sahit kai krantikariyon ko khud ko gilotin karne ke liye bheja jayega or ki daarne or lusi kaa ek betaa hoga jiskaa naam ve carton ke naam par rakhenge: betaa jo ki carton dwaara adhure chode gaye sabhi vaade puraa karegaa
 Lucy and Darnay's first son is born at the beginning of the book and dies within the same paragraph

 —final sentence of a tale of two cities i tail of tu citis charles dicens ke maatr do aitihaasik upanyaason main se ek he 
 It has fewer characters and subtitles than a typical novel by Charles Dickens
 lekhak kaa praathmik aitihaasik strothathhe French Revolution: a History thomas karlile dwaara tha: tail kii prastaavna main charles dicens ne likhaa ki "koi shri karlile kii adbhut pustak ke darshan main kuch bhi jodne kii aashaa nahin kar saktaa" karlile kaa vichaar ki itihaas vinaash or punerjeevan ke chakra se guzarataa he, ne upanyaas par mahatvapurn prabhaav daalaa, sidney carton ke jivan or mrityu dwaara vishesh rup se acchhee tarah se chitrit kiya gaya he
 Dickens uses a literal translation of French idioms for characters unable to speak English such as, "what do you do in that galley? !!" or "mere pati kahaan he? --- yahan aap mujhe dekhte hai
 "the Penguin Classics edition of the novel notes that" not all readers have considered the experiment a success
 " Dickens is noted for his humor but a Tale of Two Cities is his least comical book
 baharhaal, jeri crunchar, miss pros or shri striver kamedi pradaan karte hai
 Dickens uses satire as a comic to illustrate a variety of perspectives
 pustak dukhad paristhitiyon se bhari he isliye isamen dicens ke hasya ke liye zyaada jagah nahin he
 = dicens ke england main, punerjeevan nishchit rup se sadaiv ek isai sandarbh main hota he
 Broadly, Sydney Carton's soul is revived at the end of the novel or adhik saakaar rup se, "pehali pustak" dow manet kii qaid main jivit maut se lekar punarjanm se sambandhit he
 Resurrection first appears when Mr
 Laurie answers Jerry Cruncher's message with the words "return to Life"
 shri lorie kii dover ko buggy kii sawari ke dauraan bhi punerjeevan prakat hota he, jab vah lagaataar dow manet ke saath pariklpit baatcheet par manan karata he: unka maananaa he ki vah dow manet kii punerjeevit hone main madad kar rahe hai or vah kalpana karte hai ki vah khud "khudaai" karke dow manet ko kabr se nikaal rahe hai
 Resurrection is the main theme of the novel
 punerjeevan ko ek vishay-vastu ke rup main pehle pahal dow manet ke bare main jarvis lorie ke vichaaron main dekha jaataa he
 This is also the final theme: the sacrifice of the carton
 Dickens originally wanted to rename the entire novel as Reclaimed to Life
 jeri bhi is aavarti vishay-vastu kaa hissaa he: vah swany mrityu or punerjeevan main is tareeke se shaamil he ki pathak ko abhi tak pataa nahin chalata
 iskaa pehla purvabhaas uski apane liye kii gai tippanee main miltaa he: "jeri, agar jivan ko vaapasi kaa fishan chal niklaa to tumhaari to chaandi ho jaaegi!" is bayaan kaa malin hasya bahut baad main spasht hota he
 Five years later, on a dark and cloudy night, Mr
 Laurie recreates the reader's interest in the mystique by telling Jerry that "this is the night of 


 many more 


 to bring the dead out of the grave
" jeri dridhtaa se jawaab detaa he ki usne raat ko kabhi aisa karte nahin dekha he
 It is revealed that Jerry Cruncher's involvement with the subject of resuscitation is that he is called a "revivalist" in the Victorian language, one who digs up dead bodies to sell to medical practitioners
 nihsandeh, punerjeevan kaa vilom mrityu he
 Death and resurrection often appear in the novel
 dicens is baat se rusht hai ki frans or england main adaalatein tuchh aparaadhon ke liye maut kii sazaa de detii hai
 In France, at the instigation of an aristocrat, farmers are executed to death without any trial
 markis saharsha daarne se kahata he ki "agle kamare main, ek aadmi ko


 uski beti se kisi swaadisht bhojan ke bare main gustaakhee se baat karne ke liye - uski beti ke sammaan main sthal par hi chura bhonk diya gaya tha
 " maze kii baat he, miss pros or shri lorie dwaara dow manet ke juuta banane vaale bench ko nasht kiye jane ko "sharir jalaane" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 It seems clear that this is a rare case where death or destruction has a positive meaning because "burning" helps the doctor free him from the memory of his long imprisonment
 lekin dayaalu or aupchaarik kaary kaa is tarah dicens kaa varnan bahut is peculiar: sachche man ko vinaash or gopneeyataitani khalati he ki apana kaam karte hue or iske nishaan mitaane main lage shri lorie or miss pros ko aisa mahasoos hota he or ve aise prathit hote hai maano kisi aparaadh main sanlipt hon
 The martyrdom of Sidney Carton frees her from all her wrongdoings in the past
 apane jivan ke antim kuch dinon ke dauraan messiah ke raahat dene vaale shabdon, "main punerjeevan or jivan hoon" ko doharaate hue vah bhagwaan ko bhi dhoondta he
 Resurrection is the main theme of the novel's final part
 daarne ko antim kshan main bachaa liya jaataa he or jivan ke liye waapas bula liya jaataa he, carton apane jivan se behatar jivan ke sthaan par maut or punerjeevan ko chunata he: "vah behad shant aadmi kaa cheharaa tha
 

 He looked like Sublime and Dev "

" This symbolism appeals to Dickens's novel: a Tale of Two Cities often depicts the rising anger of the peasant horde, an indignation to which Dickens is somewhat sympathetic but ultimately irrational and animalistic
 pustak ke prarambh main dicens yah likhakar yahi bataate hai,"samudr ne vahi kiya jo use pasand he or use vinaash pasand tha
 "here the sea represents the arrival of crowds or revolutionaries
 jab gaspard markis kii hatya kar detaa he, use "vahaan chalis foot kii oonchai par faansee par latakaaya jaataa he-or latakta chhod diya jaataa he, jal ko vishakt karte hue
" The poisoning of the well represents a bitter impact on the collective sentiment of farmers due to the slaughter of gaspards

 " bheed kii ek samudr ke rup main kalpana kii gai he
 "with a roar that sounds as if all of France's breath has taken the form of a disgusting word, the living sea wave upon wave, depths of depths deepen and submerge the city
 

" Darnay's jailer is described as "a man with a puffy face and body that is drowned and filled with water"
 baad main, aatank ke shasankaal ke dauraan, kranti "itnaa adhik utpaati or vichlit ho gai

 " miss pros ke saath ladaai ke dauraan madam difaarge uske saath is tarah chipak jaati he jo "ek duubati hui mahila kii pakad se adhik" he
 Commentators on the novel have noted the irony that Madame Defarge is killed by her own gun, and perhaps Dickens from the above statement indicates that a sense of vicious vengeance like Madame Defarge would eventually destroy her predators as well
 anek ne upanyaas ko frid kii roshni main padhaa ahm or ahm

 As is common in English literature, light and darkness are symbols of good and evil

 Both Lucy and Mr
 Laurie feel deeply threatened by Madame Defarge
 lusi tippanee karti he, "us bhayanak aurat kaa mujh par saaya padaa jaan padataa he"
 haalanki shri lorie use santvanaa dene kii koshish karte hai, "us par bhi difaarge parivaar ke taur-tareeke kii chaaya he
 " madam difaarge "safed sadak par ek chaaya kii tarah" he, barf shuddhta kaa or madam difaarge andhere bhrashtachar kaa pratik he
 Dickens also compares the dark color of blood to pure white ice: the blood takes the color of the crimes of those who shed it
 bachapan main kaarkaane main kaam karne ko majaboor kiya gaya charles dicens apane kaduve anubhav kii vajah se sataae hue garibon kaa hamdard tha
 Although his sympathy with the revolutionaries was only to a certain extent, he criticizes the madness of the crowd which soon envelops
 jab ek raat main pagal aadmi or auraten gyaarah sau bandiyon kaa narsanhaar karke saan par apane hathiyaaron ko dhar dene ke liye jaldi se lautate hai to ve pradarshit karte hai "aisi ankhen jiske liye kisi bhi dayaalu darshak ko ek sahi tarah se tani gai bandook ke saath jivan ke bees saal lag gaye hote
" The reader is shown that the poor in France and England suffer the same atrocities
 jaise jaise aparaadh badhate ja rahe hai england main jallaad "vividh aparaadhiyon kii lambii kataren baandh rahaa he, ab sendhamar ko faansee

 In France, a boy's hand is cut off and sentenced to be burned alive, simply because he did not kneel in the rain in front of a parade of monks passing fifty yards away
 In the grand residence of Mosenur, one finds "the bravest clergy of the worst worldly world, the lascivious eyes, the unbridled tongue and the cheeky life 


 markis sanand un dinon ko yaad karte hai jab unke parivaar kaa unke daason ke jivan or maut par adhikaar tha, "jab aise kai kutton ko faansee par latakaane ke liye baahar le jaaya jaataa tha"

 He orders Madame Defarge's sick brother-in-law to fill the car all day and drive the frogs away at night so that the young man's disease increases and he dies quickly
 england main, bank bhi asantulit dand dete the: ghode ko daanta lagane yaa koi patr kholane ke liye aadmi ko maut kii sazaa de di jaati thi
 The condition of prisons was terrible
 "anek prakaar ke bhrasht aacharan or dushtataa hoti thi or 


 bhayanak rog palate the", kabhi kabhi abhiyukt se pehle nyaayadhish maare jate the
 Dickens is so outraged by the brutality of English law that he satirizes some of its punishments: "the whipping pillar, another old beloved institution, very humane to look at and the activities there very kind"
 sudhaar na karne ke liye vah kanoon ko doshi tehraate hai: "jo bhi sahi he" beli kii puraani ukti he
 The gruesome depiction of sawing in four pieces highlights its toughness
 puri tarah se use kshamaa kiye bina, dicens samajhataa he ki jeri crunchar apane bete kaa pet bharne ke liye kabren luutata he or pathak ko yaad dilaataa he ki sambhav he ki shri lorie jeri ko kisi or kaaran kii bajaae uski nimna saamaajik sthiti ke liye adhik koste hai
 Jerry reminds Mr
 Laurie that the Doctor, Bajaj, Chandal and Chowkidar are also involved in the conspiracy to sell the body
 dicens apane pathakon ko saavdhaan karnaa chahta he ki jis kranti ne frans ko itnaa barabaad kiya vah britain main nahin hogi jise frans kii tarah anyaaypurna dikhaaya gaya he
 But his warning is not addressed to the lower classes of Britain but to the elite

 There are no agencies of the following class in this metaphor: they only react to the behavior of the elite

 iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki carton or daarne na keval ek jaise dikhte hai balki unki "anuvanshik" vrittiyaan bhi ek si hai: carton daarne kaa bura rup he

 If so, in such works he would get a glimpse of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr

 It can only be inferred that Carton and Darnay together symbolize whose psychological personality, but it is often considered Dickens' psyche

 Leprosy or Hansen's disease, named after physician Gerhard Armor Hansen, is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis

 However, forceful quarantine or segregation of patients is unnecessary in places where adequate treatments are available, but still there is still leprosy in countries like India, China, Romania, Egypt, Nepal, Somalia, Liberia, Vietnam and Japan all over the world

 It is now believed that there may have been many cases of syphilis from early cases of leprosy
 It is now known that leprosy is neither transmitted through sexual contact nor is highly contagious after treatment because about 95% of people are naturally immunized and people suffering from it also after only 2 weeks of treatment They do not remain contagious

 It is estimated that only 5% of people are at risk of leprosy due to genetic factors

 Where taboos are strong, patients in those areas may be forced to hide their position, so that discrimination can be avoided
 Due to lack of awareness about Hansen's disease, people can believe that the disease is highly contagious and incurable

 The first telecast of Doordarshan started on 15 September 1959 as an educational and development program for half an hour on an experimental basis
 us samay doordarshan kaa prasaaran saptaah main sirf teen din aadha-aadha ghante hota tha
 It was then named 'television India', later in 1975 it was renamed as 'doordarshan' in Hindi
 yah doordarshan naam itnaa lokapriy hua ki tivi kaa hindi paryaay ban gaya
 In the initial days, there were 18 television sets across Delhi and a large transmitter
 tab dilli main log isko kutuhal or aashcharya ke saath dekhte the
 After this, Doordarshan slowly spread his legs and Delhi; Mumbai It began airing in Kolkata, Chennai
 shuruyaat main to doordarshan yani tivi dilli or aasapaas ke kuch kshetron main hi dekha jaataa tha
 The introduction of Doordarshan to cities across the country started in the 80s and was due to the Asian Games held in Delhi in 1982

 Then we started a family program on Doordarshan which broke all the records of popularity
 1984 main desh ke gaanv-gaanv main doordarshan pahunchaaneke liye desh main lagbhag har din ek transmeter lagaaya gaya
 Then came the foundation on the story of the partition of India and Pakistan, which introduced the tragedy of Partition to the generation of that period

 pozitron utsarjan tomography ) ek aisi parmaanu chikitsa imaging takanic he jo sharir kii kaaryaatmak prakriyaaon kii tri-aiami chhavi yaa chitra utpann karti he
 This system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide, which is injected into the body on a biologically active molecule
 iske baad sharir ke bheetar 3-aiami yaa 4-aiami sthaan main anurekhak sankendran ke chitron ko computer vishleshan dwaara punarnirmit kiya jaataa he
 In modern scanners, this reconstruction is often performed in the same machine, during the same session, with the help of a City X-ray performed on the patient
 yadi PET ke kiye chunaa gaya jaivik rup se sakriy anu ek glucose sambandhi FDG he, tab anurekhak kii sankendran kii chhavi, sthanik glucose udgrahan ke rup main utak chayapachay gatividhi pradaan karti he
 Although the use of this tracer results in the most common type of PET scan, the use of other tracer molecules in PET captures the tissue concentration of several other types of essential molecules
 is scan ko karne ke liye, ek alpakaalik radiodharmee anurekhak isotope ko sajiv vastu main injection ke madhyam se daalaa jaataa he 
 The tracer is chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule

 The molecule most commonly used for this purpose is fluorodeoxyglucose, a sugar for which the waiting period is typically one hour
 scan ke dauraan jaise-jaise anurekhak kaa kshay hota he utak sankendran kaa ek ricard banaaya jaataa he
 As the radioactive-isotope undergoes a positron emission decay, it leaves a positron, a resistive-particle of electron with opposite charge
 kuch millimetre tak aage badhane ke baad us pozitron kaa saamana ek electron ke saath hota he
 Due to this collision, both are eliminated, producing a pair of destructive gamma photons moving in opposite directions
 inaki pahchaan us vakt hoti he jab ve scanning upkaran main chamakate hai, unamem se raushnee foot padati he jo photomultiplir tubon yaa silicon avelaanch photodiods dwaara pahachaanaa jaataa he
 This technique relies on the simultaneous or coincident search of a photon pair moving in approximately the opposite direction
 jo photone asthaayee "jodon" main nahin aate hai unki upeksha kii jaati he
 As a result of the most significant fraction of electron-positron decay, 511 kev gamma photons are emitted approximately 180 degrees from each other; It is therefore possible to localize their source along a straight line of coincidence or called LOR)
 vaastavik upyog main LOR kii ek parimit chaudaai hoti he kyonki utsarjit photone kii duuri thik-thik 180 degree hi nahin hoti he
 If the resolving period of the detectors is less than 500 picoseconds instead of 10 nanoseconds, then this result is possible to localize into a chord segment whose length is determined by the time resolution of the detector

 This technology is not yet common, but it is available in some new systems
 aam taur par, computed tomography ke punarnirmaan or ekal photone utsarjan computed tomography data ke samaan hi ek takanic upyog kii jaati he, haalanki jo data set PET main ekatrit kiya jaataa he vah CT ke mukaable bahut kharaab hota he, isliye punarnirmaan takanic mushkil ho jaati he 
 Using data collected from tens of thousands of coincident events, a set of simultaneous equations for the total activity of a parcel of tissue attached to multiple lors can be solved by several techniques and thus the location function of the parcel or tissue fragments
 a map of radiation can be constructed as follows
 parinamswaroop praapt maanchitr, un utakon ko darshata he jisamen aanvik jaanch sankendrit ho chuki he or rogi ke upachaar or nidaan ke sandarbh main ek parmaanu chikitsa chikitsak yaa vikiran chikitsak dwaara vivechna kii ja sakati he
 PET scans are studied simultaneously with magnetic resonance imaging scans, a combination that provides both physiological and metabolic information
 kyonki PET imaging CT jaise sanrachanaatmak imaging ke saath milakar sabase adhik upyogi sabit hoti he, aadhunik PET scinar ab ekikrut ucch takanic multi - detector-ro CT scinar ke saath uplabdh hai
 Because both of these scans can be performed in an immediate sequence during a single session, the patient does not need to change their position between the two scans, two sets of images are recorded methodically, so that the distortions shown in PET imaging The area can be more heterogeneously correlated with anatomy as seen in CT images

 Radionuclides used in PET scanning are typically half-life isotopes, such as carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxygen-15 and fluorine-18
 ye radionucliide yaa to un yogicon main shaamil hote hai jinka prayog saamaanya rup se sharir karata he jaise glucose, jal yaa ammonia, yaa phir un anuon main shaamil hote hai jo receptor yaa dawa kii karrwai kii anya citon se aabaddh hote hai
 Such labeled compounds are known as radioimulators
 yah pahchaanana mahatvapurn he ki PET takanic kaa prayog jivit maanav main kisi bhi yogic ke jeevigyaanik path kii pahchaan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, basharte use PET isotope se radiolabel kiya gaya ho
 Thus the specific processes that can be tested with PET are almost infinite and the radioimulator for newly targeted molecules and processes is synthesized at all times; By the time of writing this article, dozens are being used clinically and hundreds in research
 Currently, however, by far the most commonly used nuclid in clinical PET scanning is fluorine-18 as FDG
 adhikansh radioisotope ke ardh-jivan ke kaaran, radiunurekhak kaa utpaadan un ek cychlotron or radiorsayan prayogshaala ke upyog se kiya janaa chahie jo PET imaging suvidha ke nikat hai
 The half-life of fluorine-18 is so long that radioine labeled fluorine-18 can be manufactured commercially from a site to a remote location
 rogi ko vikiran khuraaq kii nunata, alpajivi radionucliide ke upyog kii ek aakarshak visheshta he
 In addition to its established role as a diagnostic technique, PET has a wide role as a method of assessing response to therapy, in particular, cancer therapy, where the disease is compared to the risk of testing radiation
 Ignorance about progress poses a much greater risk to the patient
 PET kaa vyapak upyog karne se jo baat baadha utpann karti he vah he PET scanning ke liye alp-jivi radionucliide nirmaan karne hetu aavashyak cychlotron kii ucch laagat or radiodawa kaa utpadaan karne ke liye vishesh rup se anukulit on-sait rasayan sanshleshan upkaran kii zarurat

 This limitation limits clinical PET use primarily to tracers that are labeled with fluorine-18, which have a half-life of 110 minutes and can be sent to a reasonable distance before use, or rubidium
 -82 which can be made into a portable generator and is used for myocardial liquefaction studies
 phir bhi, haal ke kuch varshon main ekikrut parirakshan or garm prayogshaalaon vaale on-site cychlotron ko PET ikaayiyon ke saath doordaraj ke aspataalon main bheja jane laga he
 The presence of small on-site cyclotrons is expected to expand in future as cyclotrons are decreasing in response to the high cost involved in sending isotopes to remote PET machines
 chunki fluorine-18 kaa ardh-jivan kareeb do ghante kaa hota he, is radionuclid ko dhaaran karne vaali ek radiodawa kii khuraaq, kaary diwas ke dauraan kshay ke kai ardh-jivan se guzaregi

 The raw data collected by the PET scanner is a list of 'coincident events' representing the identification of nearly simultaneous destructive photons by a pair of detectors
 prayek sanyogi ghatana, aise do detectaron jinke saath pozitron utsarjan hua, ko jodne vaali ek rekha kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 Modern systems with high time resolution also use a technique in which they more accurately determine the time between detection of both photons and are thus able to reduce the previously mentioned line by about 10 cm
 sanyogi ghatnaon ko sinogram naamak prakshepan chhaviyon main baanta ja saktaa he
 Syngograms can be classified by looking at each view and angle of inclination, the latter in a 3D case image
 The cenogram images correspond to the projection drawn by a computed tomography scanner and can be reconstructed properly
 haalanki, aankadon kii sankhyikee, sancharan tomography ke madhyam se praapt aankadon se bahut badtar hoti he
 a typical PET data set would count millions for the entire acquisition, while cts could count up to a few billion
 vaise, CT data ke mukaable, PET data bikharaav or aniyamit ghatnaon se bahut adhik naatakeey rup se peedit rahete hai
 In practicality, a considerable amount of pre-processing of data is necessary such as correction of irregular coincidences, estimation and subtraction of scattered photons, correction of the detector's pause time and improvement in the sensitivity of the detector

 Attenuation Correction: Since different lors require crossing different thicknesses of tissue, the photons are tanned differently
 natijatan, sharir kii gaharaai main sanrachanaayen mithyaa rup main nimna anurekhak udgrahan ke saath punarnirmit hoti hai
 Contemporary scanners can estimate attenuation using the integrated X-ray CT device, although earlier instruments offered crude versions of CT using gamma ray sources and PET detectors
 jabaki kshinan-parishkrut chhaviyaan aam taur par adhik sateek pradarshan hoti hai, khud sudhaar prakriya hi mahatvapurn trutiyon ke prati samvedansheel he
 As a result, images, both modified and unmodified, are always reconstructed and read together
