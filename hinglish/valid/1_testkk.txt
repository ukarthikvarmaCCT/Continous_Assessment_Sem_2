 Steven Rogers was born in 1920 in Manhattan, New York to poor Irish immigrants Sarah and Joseph Rogers

 In the early 1940s, prior to America's entry into World War II, Rogers was a student of fine arts
 chithran main maahir rogers ek hasya pustak lekhak or kalakaar bhi tha
 Upset over the rise of Nazi Germany, Rogers attempted to enlist in the army, but was rejected because of his evil body

 Joseph Reinstein"
 dow

 For this reason, when the Nazi spy Heinz Kruger kills Erskine, the "erskine method" of creating new super soldiers also dies
 uski mrityu kaa badla rogers "captain america" ke rup main letaa he
 Unable to create new super soldiers and to hide the failure of "project: Rebirth", the US government presents Captain America as a patriotic superhero, fighting the threat of Red Skull as a counter-intelligence agent Is capable of rogers ko apane swayan ke dizin kii hui ek deshbhakti vardi, ek bulatopruf dhaal, ek vyaktigat bandook, or kodenam captain america kii aapurti kii jaati he

 Later on Jones insists Rogers gives him Bucky's costume, but this partnership does not last long; With the help of a cosmic cube, Red Skull takes the form of Rodgers and takes Jones away

 bhartiya bhashaayen Hinduism is the largest and fundamental religious group of India and 79
8% of the population of India follow this religion
 bharat main vaidic samskruti kaa udgam 2000 se 1500 isa purv main hua tha
 As a result, Hinduism is considered to be the serial of Vedic religion, which has had a profound influence on Indian history

 Another famous name of India is Hindustan, meaning "land of Hindus"
 hindu dharm lagbhag 5000 saal se vyavasthit viksit hua he or saat charnon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he ki doorabeen ek-duusare main he
 Some Hindutva advocates would believe that Hinduism was revealed to the sages in its entirety by the end of the Ice Age 12,000 years ago
 hindutv ke itihaas main, puranic kathaayen sirf samay-samay par itihaas he, itihaaskaar gananaa nahin kar sakate yaa nahin
 In recent times, Hinduism has been described as an "open source religion", unique in that it has no defined founder or doctrine, and its ideas constantly evolve in response to historical and geographical realities
 yah kai sahaayak nadiyon or shakhaon ke saath ek nadi ke rup main sabase acha varnit he, hindutv shakhaon main se ek he, or vartmaan main bahut shaktishaalee he, kai log swayan ko nadi ke rup main maanate hai
 About 5000 years ago, in the Bronze Age, now called the Harappan Civilization, characterized by brick cities, which reached the vast area of the Indus river valley over the Ganges for nearly a thousand years
 samtal
 In these cities, we find clay seals with images that are very much part of the current Hindu nature such as the pipal tree, the bull, the swastika, the seven maids, and a man sitting in a yoga pose
 ham is charan ke bare main bahut kuch nahin jaanate kyonki bhashaa ko samajhane ke liye bana rahata he
 3,500 years ago, in the Iron Age, Vedic hymns and rituals can be traced back to Harappan ideas, but are designed for a nomadic and rural lifestyle rather than a sustainable urban lifestyle
 kuch hindutv ke adhivaktaaon puri tarah asahmat hai or jor dete hai ki do charnon vastav main ek hai
 In this phase, we get a worldview that celebrates the physical world, where gods are introduced to rituals, and are said to provide health and wealth, prosperity and peace
 devataaon ko aamantrit karne or unase anugrah praapt karne kaa yah pahalu aaj bhi jari he, haalanki ye rasmen alag-alag hai
 The Vedas reveal a gradual spread from the Indus to the Upper Ganges and Lower Gangetic Plains
 kuch hindutv vidwaan is tarah ke bhugolic failaav kaa khandan karte hai or upmahadweep par jor dete hai ki pracheen samay se puri tarah se viksit, samroop, shahari vaidic samskruti, plastic kii surgery or yahaan tak ki hawaii jahaaj jaise unnat praudyogiki ke liye
 In the third phase, with texts known as the Upanishads 2,500 years ago, where more importance was given to introspection and meditation than rituals, and we focus more on ideas like rebirth, monasticism, liberation from the cycle of birth and death
 We do
 is charan main buddha dharm or jain dharm jaise shaman paramparaon kaa udai dekha gaya, iske anuyaayiyon ne paali or praakrit main baat kii or vedic rup or vaidic bhashaa, sanskrit kaa bhi khaarij kar diya
 It also included Brahmin priests reorganizing Vedic ideas through the creation of scriptures, books that focus on the ritual of regulating and passing social life through marriage, and the obligations of people to their ancestors, Depends on their caste and world
 vishaal
 Many academics use Brahmanism to describe this association of Vedic ideas and see it as a radically patriarchal and Magasian force that competes violently with the orders of egalitarian and pacifist monasteries
 buddha dharm or jain dharm, vaidic prathaon or vishwaason ke saath, uttar bharat se dakshin bharat tak fail gaya, or antat upmahadweep se madhya asia tak or dakshin purv asia tak fail gaya
 In the south, Tamil Sangam culture was encountered, with information that comes from a collection of early poems that reveal some knowledge of Vedic rituals and later epics with knowledge of Buddhism and Jainism
 kuch hindutv vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki koi alag tamil sangam samskruti nahin thi
 It was part of a fully developed, homogenous, urban Vedic culture, where everyone spoke Sanskrit
 chauthe charan main 2,000 saal pehle shuru hue ramayana, mahabharat or puraana jaise lekhon kaa udai hua, jahaan kahaniyon ko gharelu or vishwa sambandhon kii vishvadrushti kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he or ab parichit hindu vishvadrushti kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 We are introduced to a fully developed mythology where the world has no beginning or end, with many heavens and many hellos, controlled by action and reaction, where all societies go through cycles of birth and death Are, just like all living beings, temples and temple rituals arose in this phase
 ham mathvaasi vedantik adeshon kaa udai bhi dekhte hai jo sharir or sabakuch samvednaatmak, saath hi jaap tantrik adeshon se sharir ko bhrasht karte hai or sharir or sabhi chizon kii khoj karte hai
 We can also see the mingling of the old Nigama tradition, where divinity is considered formless with the new Agma tradition, where the divine takes the form of Shiva and his sons, Vishnu and his avatars, and the goddess and her many forms
 nae adeshon or paramparaon ke ubharne ke saath, ham jati pranali ke samekan ko bhi dekhte hai, jo vyavsaayon ke aadhaar par samudaay samooh nahin he, jo antarimari na hone se khud ko alag karata he
 Many academics have seen caste as an essential feature of Hinduism in favor of the upper castes, which it is alleged that Hindus reject
 kai hindutv ke vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati ke paas ek vaigyanik or tarksangat aadhaar he, or uske paas raajnneeti yaa arthshaastra ke saath kuch bhi nahin he
 The fifth stage is 1,000 years old, and it saw the rise of devotion as a principle, where devotees are connected to the deities through passionate songs, composed in regional languages, often bypassing the temple system
 yah vah samay tha jab ek kathor jati ke padanukram ne khud ko dridhtaapurvak lagaaya tha, jo pavitrataa ke siddhant par aadhaarit thi or kuch jatiyon ko ashubh or ayogy rup main dekha ja rahaa tha
 They too cannot be well deprived of the community
 This is also the time when Islam enters India, peacefully moves south through the merchants of the sea and violently to the north through the Central Asian chieftains, Those who destroy Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples, which are also centers of political power and eventually establish their rule, are often associated with Hindu kings Area were opposed to the Vijayanagar Empire Ahoms, Marathas and the Deccan Rajput, east to the north
 hindutv ne islam ke aagaman or dilli or dekkani sultanaton ke utthan ko dekhte hue, baad main mughal shashan ko mahaan hindu samskruti ke ant ke rup main chihnit kiya, yah ek vishay he ki marxvaadi itihaaskaaron ne pagal sampradayik prachaar kiya he
 Later only hindu-islamic cooperation was exposed, going to other extreme, non-marxist historians argue chathe charan 300 varsh kaa he jab hindu dharm upmahadweep main europea shakti ke udai ko uttar dete hai, or isai mishnariyon ke parinamswaroop aagaman or tarksangat vaigyanik vyaakhyaan
 Some Hindutva scholars do not differentiate between the two
 is yug main europea vidwaanon ne vaigyanik vidhiyon or judev-isai lens donon kaa upyog karke hindu dharm kii bhaavana banane kii koshish kii
 For him, monotheism was true religion and scientific; Polytheism was pagan mythology
 He began a vast practice of translating and documenting the Hindu way of life
 unhone ek pavitra kitaab, ek nabi, or adhik mahatvapurn baat, ek uddeshy kii talash kii
 Eventually, to organize the complexity, he began to define Hinduism as Brahmanism, which was different from Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism
 yah orientlist dhaancha vidyalayon, collejon or media ke madhyam se purvi dharmon kii vaishvik samaj ko suchit karata rahaa he
 a liquid oral culture was settled until the 19th century

 Some decided to reform Hinduism to look colonial
 dusron ne hindu dharm ke "sachche saar" kii khoj karne or "baad main bhrasht" prathaon ko khaarij kar diya
 Still others rejected Hinduism itself and saw all religions as a dark dangerous force, rationally and scientifically altered

 Hindutva saw Marxism and all other Western discourses as another form of Christian discourse, seeking to eradicate all traces of the Hindu way of life, what Islam had done in Central and Southeast Asia in previous centuries

 Many intellectuals, when they argued that concepts like Hinduism and India, were the creation of the British, with no real ancient roots, rejected the faith of the general public as contrary to fanciful imaginations

 In return, the British launched a war against Julu
 gandhi ji ne bharatiyon ko bhartee karne ke liye british adhikariyon ko sakriy rup se prerit kiya
 His argument was that Indians should cooperate in war efforts to legalize their citizenship claims
 tathaapi, angrejon ne apni sena main bharatiyon ko pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Despite this, he accepted Gandhiji's proposal that Indians can do voluntary work to bring wounded British soldiers to Stetcher for treatment
 is kor kii bagdor gandhi ne thami
 On 21 July 1906, Gandhiji wrote in the Indian Opinion of the Indian Opinion that a corps has been formed at the behest of the Natal Government by experiment in relation to the operation against 23 Indian residents

 In Gandhi's opinion, the draft ordinance of 1906 was like bringing the status of Indians below the level of a resident
 isliye unhone satyagrah, kii tarj par "kafir s " 
kaa udhaaharan dete hue bharatiyon se adhyadesh kaa virodh karne kaa aagrah kiya

 Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1918 in the Champaran Satyagraha and the Kheda Satyagraha, although the movements of indigo cash-paying food crops were also important, rather than the food crops necessary for his subsistence

 This situation was disappointing
 kheda, gujarat main bhi yahi samasya thi
 Gandhiji built an ashram there where many of his supporters and new voluntary workers were organized
 unhone gaanvon kaa ek vistrut adhyayan or surveykshan kiya jisamen praaniyon par hue atyaachaar ke bhayanak candon kaa lekhajokha rakhaa gaya or isamen logon kii anutpaadakeey saamaanya avasthaa ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Creating confidence in the villagers, he started his work by cleaning the villages under which schools and hospitals were built and the rural leadership was motivated to eliminate many of the social evils mentioned above
 lekin iske pramukh prabhaav us samay dekhne ko mili jab unhen ashaanti failaane ke liye police ne giraftaar kiya or unhen praant chhodane ke liye aadesh diya gaya
 Thousands of people protested and took out rallies outside jails, police stations and courts and demanded Gandhi ji to be released unconditionally
 gandhi ji ne jameendaaron ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan or hadataalon ko kaa netritv kiya jinhone angreji sarkaar ke maargdarshan main us kshetra ke garib kisaanon ko adhik kshatipurti manjuur karne tathaa kheti par niyantran, rajasav main badhotari ko radd karnaa tathaa ise sangrahit karne vaale ek samjhaute par hastakshar kiye

 kheda main sardaar patel ne angrejon ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke liye kisaanon kaa netritv kiya jisamen angrejon ne rajasav sangrahan se mukti dekar sabhi kaidiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya tha

 The Jallianwala massacre of Indians by the British forces in Punjab, also known as the Amritsar massacre, caused tremendous shock to the nation, which sparked a flame of anger and violence in the public
 gandhiji ne british raaj tathaa bharatiyon dwaara pratikaratmak ravaiya donon kii kii
 He expressed condolences to the British citizens and victims of the riots and condemned the riots after the initial opposition of the party
 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress
kaa kaaryakari adhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 Under his leadership, the Congress was organized with a new objective called Swaraj

 gandhi ji ne apane ahimsaatmak manch ko swadeshi niti — main shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya jisamen videshi vastuon visheshkar angreji vastuon kaa bahishkaar karnaa tha
 His advocacy associated with this was that all Indians should wear handmade khadi by our own people rather than the clothes made by the British
 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women
 iske alaava gandhi ji ne britain kii shaikshik sansthaaon tathaa adaalaton kaa bahishkaar or sarkari naukariyon ko chhodane kaa tathaa sarkaar se praapt tamagon or sammaan ko waapas lautaane kaa bhi anurodh kiya
 Non-cooperation got far-reaching appeal and success which increased the enthusiasm and participation of people from all sections of the society
 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua
 In view of the fear of the movement adopting a stand of violence and considering that it would destroy all its actions, Gandhiji withdrew this movement of widespread non-cooperation
 gandhi par giraftaar kiya gaya 10 march, 1922, ko rajdroh ke liye gandhi ji par mukadmaa chalaaya gaya jisamen unhen chah saal kaid kii sajaa sunaakar gel bhed diya gaya

 In addition, cooperation between Hindus and Muslims was breaking at the peak of the non-violence movement
 gandhi ji ne is khai ko bahut se sadhano se bharne kaa prayaas kiya jisamen unhone 1924 kii basant main simit safalataa dilaane vaale teen saptaah kaa upwas karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore
 26 janvari 1930 kaa din lahore main bhartiya swatantraaa diwas ke rup main indian neshnal congress ne manaaya
 The day was also celebrated by almost every Indian organization
 iske baad gandhi ji ne march 1930 main namak par kar lagaae jane ke virodh main nayaa satyagrah chalaaya jise 12 march se 6 april tak namak andolan ke yaad main 400 kilometre tak kaa safar ahmedabad se dandi, gujarat tak chalaaya gaya taaki swayan namak utpann kiya ja sake
 Thousands of Indians participated in this journey towards the sea

 The government, represented by Lord Edward Irwin, decided to hold discussions with Gandhiji

 To end the Civil Disobedience Movement, the British government agreed to release all political prisoners
 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted
 gandhi ji ne in achhuton ko harijan kaa naam diya jinhen ve bhagwaan kii santan maanate the
 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21- day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement 
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke dinon main hindustan kii saamaajik buraaiyon main main chuaachhut ek pramukh buraai thi jiske ke viruddh mahatma gandhi or unke anuyaayi sangharshrat rahete the
 At that time the entry of Harijans into the major temples of the country was completely restricted
 kerala rajya kaa janapad trishur dakshin bharat kii ek pramukh dharmik nagari he
 There is an iconic temple here, Guruvayur Temple, in which the statue of Lord Guruvayurappan, showing the form of Lord Krishna, is installed
 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933
 mandir ke trustiyon ko is baat kii taakid kii gayi ki naye varsh kaa pratham diwas arthath 1 janvari 1934 ko antim nishchay diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa or is tithi par unke str se koi nishchay na hone kii sthiti me mahatma gandhi tathaa shri kelppan dwaara aandolankariyon ke paksh main aamaran anshan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple
 baithak me 77 pratishat upasko ke dwaara diye gayi bahumat ke aadhaar par mandir main harijanon ke pravesh ko sweekruti de di gayi or is prakaar 1 janvari 1934 se kerala ke shri guruvayur mandir main kiye gayi nishchay diwas kii safalataa ke rup main harijanon ke pravesh ko saidvantik sweekruti mil gayi
 The Guruvayur temple to which non-hindus still enter is forbidden, however the God of many religions is an ardent devotee of Lord Guruvayurappan
 mahatma gandhi kii prerana se janvari maah ke pratham diwas ko nishchay diwas ke rup main manaaya gaya or kiye gayi nishchay ko praapt kiya gaya
 
 1934 kii garmiyon main, unki jaan lene ke liye un par teen asafal prayaas kiye gaye the
 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party
 vah party ke is kadam se asahmat nahin the kintu mahasoos karte the ki yadi ve istipha dete hai tab bharatiyon ke saath uski lokapriyata party kii sadsyta ko majboot karne main aasaani pradaan karegi jo ab tak communiston, samaajwaadiyon, vyapaar sanghon, chaatro, dharmik netaaon se lekar vyapaar sanghon or vibhinn awaajon ke bich vidyaman thi
 This will give all of them an opportunity to listen to their own words

 Gandhiji returned to India in 1936 with the Lahore session of the Nehru Presidency and Congress
 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence
 bose ne gandhi ji kii aalochana ke baavjood bhi duusari baar jeet hasil kii kintu congress ko us samay chhod diya jab sabhi bhartiya netaaon ne gandhi ji dwaara lagu kiye gaye sabhi siddhaton kaa parityag kar diya gaya
 When World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland
 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public
 did
 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border
 gandhi ji ke duusare number par baithe jawaharlal nehru kii party ke kuch sadasyon tathaa kuch anya rajnatik bhartiya dalon ne aalochana kii jo angrejon ke paksh tathaa vipaksh donon main hi vishwaas rakhte the
 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough
 bharat chodo is sangharsh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee andolan ban gaya jisamen vyapak hinsa or giraftaar hui
 Thousands of freedom fighters were either killed or injured by police bullets and thousands were arrested
 gandhi or unke samarthakon ne spasht kar diya ki vah yuddh ke prayaason kaa samarthan tab tak nahin denge tab tak bharat ko tatkaal aazaadee na de di jaae
 He clarified that this time also this movement will not stop if individual acts of violence are materialized
 unhone kaha ki unke chaaron ore araajaktaa kaa aadesh asli araajaktaa se bhi bura he
 He asked all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline for ultimate freedom by doing or die with non-violence
 gandhi ji or congress kaaryakaarani samiti ke sabhi sadasyon ko angrejon dwaara mubani main 9 agast 1942 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Gandhiji was held captive for two years at Agah Khan palace, Pune
 yahi vah samay tha jab gandhi ji ko unke nijee jivan main do gahare aghat lage
 His 50-year-old secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba Gandhi died on 22 February 1944 after Gandhiji spent 18 months in jail
 iske chha: saptaah baad gandhi ji ko bhi malaria kaa bhayankar shikaar hona padaa
 He was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 due to his poor health and necessary treatment
 raaj unhen jail main dam todate hue nahin dekhnaa chaahate the jisase desh kaa krodh bad jaae
 Although the Quit India movement was a partial success in its objective, but the stubborn suppression of the movement united India by the end of 1943
 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries
 bharat main rahane vaale bahut se hinduon or sikhon evam muslimon kaa baari bahumat desh ke bantwaare ke paksh main tha
 Additionally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, introduced extensive cooperation in West Punjab, Sindh, North West Frontier Province and East Bengal
 vyapak str par failane vaale hindu muslim ladaai ko rokane ke liye hi congress netaaon ne bantwaare kii is yojana ko apni manjuuri de di thi
 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he
 After a passionate debate with allies who had supported Gandhi ja throughout his life, Gandhiji refused to accept the matter and the government had to stick to its policy and make payments to Pakistan
 hindu muslim or sikh samudaay ke netaaon ne unhen vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve hinsa ko bhula kar shanti laaenge
 These communities included the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha

 He tried to learn by experimenting on his own mistakes and on his own to achieve this goal
 unhone apni aatmakatha ko satya ke prayog kaa naam diya
 Gandhi said that the most important battle to be fought is to conquer elements like your demons, fear and insecurity
 
gandhi ji ne apane vichaaron ko sabase pehle us samay sankshep main vyakt kiya jab unhone kaha bhagwaan hi satya he baad main unhone apane is kathan ko satya hi bhagwaan he main badal diya
 Thus, Gandhi's philosophy in truth is "god"

 Non-violence, non-violence and non-violence has a long history in Indian religious thought and has many concepts in its Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian communities

 He was told to say: jab main niraash hota hum tab main yaad karata hum ki haalanki itihaas satya kaa maarg hota he kintu prem ise sadaiv jeet letaa he

 One eye for another will make the whole world blind
 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent
 " for pasifists
" naamak pustak se uddhran liye gaye hai
 The war of science leads a person to dictatorship, pure and simple

 In an interview given after the war in 1946, he presented an idea even further
 yahudiyon ko apane liye swayan kasaai kaa chaaku de dena chahie tha
 They should have thrown themselves into the sea from sea rocks
 phir bhi gandhi ji ko pataa tha ki is prakaar ke ahimsa ke str ko atoot vishwaas or saahas kii jarurat hogi or iske liye usne mahasoos kar liya tha ki yah har kisi ke paas nahin hota he
 He therefore advised everyone that they do not need to keep non-violence with them, especially when it is used for the protection of cowardice
 gandhi ji ne apane satyagrah andolan main aise logon ko dur hi rakhaa jo hathiyaar uthaane se darate the athwa pratirodh karne main swayan kii aakshamata kaa anubhav karte the
 He wrote that i believe that if one has to choose between cowardice and violence, then i will give my opinion in favor of violence

 This was due to his heir apparent curiosity in which his enthusiastic friend Sheikh Mehtab also contributed

 gandhi kaa parivaar bhi isse achoota nahin tha
 Before coming to London to study, Gandhiji had made a promise to his mother Putlibai and his uncle Bechariji Swamy that he would abstain from eating meat, drinking alcohol and from concussion
 unhone apane vaayade rakhane ke liye upwas kiye or aisa karne se saboot kuch aisa mila jo bhojan karne se nahin mil saktaa tha, unhone apane jivan paryant darshan ke liye aadhaar jo praapt kar liya tha
 As Gandhi became an adult he became completely vegetarian
 unhone da moral basis of vegeterionism tathaa is vishay par bahut si lekh bhi likhen hai jinamein se kuch landan vegeterian sosayadi ke prakaashan da vegeterian main prakashit bhi hue hai
 Gandhi himself was inspired by many great personalities during this period and became a friend of Dr
 Josiah Oldfield, the chairman of the London Vegetarian Society
 henry stephen salt|henry stephen salt kii kritiyon ko padhne or prashansha karne ke baad yuva mohandas gandhi shaakaahaari prachaarak se mili or unke saath patrachaar kiya
 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he
 Apart from this, many Indians who were struggling due to low income, who were seen as vegetarian at that time, it was not only spiritual tradition but also due to practicality
 They avoided eating for too long, and political Fasting as a protest, he refused to eat until his death
 His autobiography notes that being a vegetarian is a celibacy
 His success in total control celibacy without first ladder to re commitment, almost failed
 gandhi ji shuru se falahar, karte the lekin apane chikitsak kii salaah se bakrii kaa doodh pinaa shuru kiya tha

 However, one day his uncle came to give Gandhi ji some time relief, he reached the bedroom for rest where his physical desires were awakened and he loved his wife and shortly after the servant left, the news came that Gandhi His father has just died
 Gandhiji felt a tremendous crime and he could never forgive himself for this
 This incident in m had a significant impact on Gandhi and he turned to celibacy at the age of 36, while he was married
 yah nirnay brahmacharya ke darshan se puri tarah prabhavit tha aadhyatmik or vyavhaarik shuddhta bade paimaane par brahmacharya or vairagyavaad se juda hota he

 Gandhiji believed that if a person is employed in social service, then he should move on to a more ordinary life, which he considered necessary for celibacy
 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes
 On one occasion, he also returns the gift provided to the birthmother for his continued service to the Samudayas

 After reading John Ruskin's Unto This Last, he decided to change his lifestyle and create a community called Amarpakshi Settlement
 dakshin africa, jahaan se unhone vakaalat puri kii thi tathaa dhan or safalataa ke saath jude the vahaan se lautne ke pashchaat unhone pashchami style ke vastron kaa tyaag kiya

 saadhaaran hindu kii tarah ve saare dharmon ko samaan rup se maanate the, or isliye unhone dharm-parivartan ke saare tarkon evam prayaason ko asweekrut kiya
 He was knowledgeable of Brahm Gyan and read all the major religions in detail
 unhone hindu dharm ke bare main nimnlikhit baaten kahi hai- Gandhi has also interpreted the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati
 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature
 dhong, kupratha aadi par bhi unhone sabhi dharmo ke siddhanton ke prati sawalia rukh akhriyaar kiya
 He was a tireless social reformer
 unki kuch tippaniyan vibhinn dharmo ke sandarbh main is prakaar hai : Later when asked if you are a Hindu, he said: ek duusare ke prati gaharaa aadar bhav hone ke baavjood gandhi or rabindranath thakur ek se adhik baar lambi bahes main lage rahe
 These debates reflect philosophical differences between the two
 ye donon hi us samay ke prasiddh bhartiya chintak the
 In the context of the horrific earthquake that struck Bihar on 15 January 1934, Gandhiji first said in a public meeting in Tinnevalli on 24 January 1934 that even if you call me superstitious, a man like me would believe that God punished us for our sins Have sent this terrible earthquake to give
 


 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he
 Therefore, we should learn from this catastrophe of Bihar that while remaining a few short breaths, we should get rid of this stigma of untouchability and enable ourselves to appear before our Creator with a clean heart
 25 janvari ko bhi unhone logon ko is ghatana ke sandarbh main asprishyata ko mahapaap maanakar tyaagane kii prerana di tathaa 26 janvari ko madura main vyapaariyon dwaara yojit swaagat samaaroh main unhone kaha ki mujhe to yah vishwaas hota ja rahaa he ki ham par yah vipatti asprishyata ke is mahapaap ke falswaroop hi ai he
 i request you not to laugh at my words and think that i am awakening your instinct of superstition
 main aisa kuch nahin kar rahaa hoon
 


 i may be called superstitious, but what i am feeling in the depths of my heart, i cannot live without telling you
 


 yadi aap bhi meri hi tarah is baat main vishwaas karte hon to aap nirnay karne main tatparta baratenge or yah maanenge ki aaj ham jaisi asprishyata baratate hai waisi asprishyata kaa vidhaan hindu shastron main nahin he
 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God
 yadi main apane ghor agyaan ke kaaran us vishwaas kaa upyog apane virodhiyon kii ninda karne ke liye karuun to nishchay hi aisa vishwaas patankaaree andhvishwaas ban jaayegaa
 Instead of making an air debate on Gandhiji and making arbitrary conclusions, it is not only an age-old requirement but also a prudence to keep in mind the authenticity of the basis of Gandhiji's beliefs
 saamaanya se vishisht tak -- sabhi sandarbhon main dastaveji rup praapt gandhi ji kaa likhaa-bolaa praayah prayek shabd adhyayan ke liye uplabdh he
 So it is naturally necessary that in view of them, something should be taken to a proper stage
 likhane kii pravriti gandhiji main aarambh se hi thi
 Throughout his life he has written more than Vachik
 chaahe vah tippaniyon ke rup main ho yaa patron ke rup main
 In addition to writing many books, he also took out many magazines and wrote them well
 unke mahatvapurn lekhan kaary ko nimna binduon ke antargat dekha ja saktaa he: Gandhiji was a successful writer

 When he returned to India, he started a monthly magazine called 'navajivan'
 baad main navajivan kaa prakaashan hindi main bhi hua
 Apart from this, he wrote letters to individuals and newspapers almost everyday gandhi ji dwaara moulik rup se likhit pustaken chaar hai-- hind swaraj, dakshin africa ke satyagrah kaa itihaas, satya ke prayog, tathaa gita padaarth kosh sahit sampurna gita kii tikaa
 Gandhiji usually wrote in Gujarati, but translated or got his books translated into Hindi and English as well
 hind swaraj naamak alpakaay granthratna gandhiji ne england se lautate samay kildonon casil naamak jahaaj par gujarati main likhaa tha or unke dakshin africa pahunchne par indian opinian main prakashit hua tha
 The first twelve chapters in the December 11, 1909 issue and the remaining in the December 18, 1909 issue
 pustak rup main iskaa prakaashan pehali baar janvari 1910 main hua tha or bharat main bombay sarkaar dwaara 24 march 1910 ko iske prachaar par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 Gandhiji responded to this action of the Bombay Government by publishing an English translation of it
 is pustak ke parishisht-1 main pustak main pratipaadit vishay ke adhik adhyayan ke liye 20 pustakon kii suchi bhi di gayi he jisase gandhiji ke tatkaaleen adhyayan ke vistaar kii ek jhalak bhi milti he
 'history of South Africa's Satyagraha' originally started writing 'south African Satyagrahana History' in Gujarati on 26 November 1923 while he was in Yerwada Jail
 5 farvari 1924 ko reeha hone ke samay tak unhone pratham 30 adhyay likh daale the
 This history was published as an article in the 'navajivan' from 13 April 1924 to 22 November 1925
 pustak ke rup main iske do khand kramshah 1924 or 1925 main chape
 The first edition of the English translation by Valji Desai was published by S
 Ganesan Madras in 1928 and the second and third editions by Navjivan Prakashan Mandir, Ahmedabad in 1950 and 1961, with the required modifications
 aatmakatha ke mul gujarati adhyay dharawahik rup se 'navajivan' ke ankon main prakashit hue the
 It began with the publication of 'preamble' in the issue of 29 November 1925 and its completion from the last chapter titled 'purnahuti' in the 3 February 1929 issue
 gujarati adhyyon ke prakaashan ke saath hi hindi navajivan main unka hindi anuwaad or yang india main unka angreji anuwaad bhi diya jaataa rahaa
 Accordingly, the translation of 'preamble' was published in the 3 December 1925 issue of 'hindi Navajivan'
 hindi anuwaad main aatmakatha kaa pehla khand pustak ke rup main pehali baar sasta sahitya mandal, dilli se san 1928 main prakashit hua tha
 Navjivan Trust, the proprietor of Gandhiji's works, published his Hindi translation on his behalf in 1957
 shrimadbhagavadgita se gandhi ji kaa hardik lagaav praayah aaajeevan rahaa
 His contemplation and writing on the Gita also continued for a long time
 sampoorn gita kaa gujarati anuwaad, prastaavna sahit, unhone june 1929 main puraa kiya tha or 12 march 1930 ko navajivan prakaashan mandir, ahmedabad se 'anasakti yoga' naam se uskaa pustakaakaar prakaashan hua tha
 Its translation into Hindi, Bangla and Marathi was also instant
 angreji anuwaad iske baad janvari 1931 main sampann hua tha tathaa pehle yang india ke ank main prakashit hua tha
 Since the translation of each verse of the Gita was not easily comprehensible to the general readers, Gandhi ji wrote the expressions of each chapter of the Gita in a comprehensible way for the general readers

 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love
 phir bhi, jaik homer gandhi ke jinna ke saath pakistan ke vishay ko lekar ek lambey patrachaar par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai- "haalaanki gandhi vaiyaktik rup main vibhaajan ke khilaaf the, unhone sahmati kaa suzav diya jiske tahat congress or muslim lig asthaayee sarkaar ke neeche samjhauta karte hue apni aazaadee praapt karen jiske baad vibhaajan ke prashn kaa faisla un jilon ke janamat dwaara hoga jahaan par musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return
 kyon nahi ve, prithvi ke dusre logon se prem karte hai, us desh ko apana ghar banaate jahaan par unka janm hua or jahaan par unhone jivicoparjan kiya
 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct

 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa 
 or iske liye main yahudee bhaaiyon kaa intazaar naahe karuunga ki ve aayen or mere vaidhanik pratrodh main mujhase juden, balki mujhe aatmavishvaas hoga ki akhir main sabhi meraa udahaaran maanane ke liye baadhya ho jaayenge
 yahan par jo nuskhaa diya gaya he agar vah ek bhi yahudee yaa saare yahudee sweekaar kar len, to unki sthiti jo aaj he usase badtar nahi hogi

 agar yahudiyon kaa dimag sweyapurvak pidaa sahane ke liye tayar ho, meri kalpana he ki sanhaar kaa din bhi dhanyavad gyaapan or anand ke din main badal jayega jaisaa ki jihova ne gadhaa

 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi

 "on the subject of immigration in 1903, Gandhi commented that" i believe that as much as they believe in the purity of their caste, we also 


 We believe that the white race in South Africa should be the best caste Should
 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist

 At the center of chapter one, "gandhi, African-born Indians in colonial status" which is about the relationship between African and Indian communities in "white supremacy" and the policies that led to the partition, he says, "young Gandhi was influenced in 1890 by the divisive ideas that prevailed at that time

 " ve jari rakhte hai un vivaadon kaa hawala dete hue jo gandhi ki pratimaa ke anaavaran ke dauraan uthe the
 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion
 " Gandhi was anti-raj in the form where he had a vision of an India that was not under any government
 unka vichaar tha ki ek desh main sachche swashaasan kaa arth he ki pratyak vyakti khud par shashan karata hai tathaa koi aisa rajya nahin jo logon par kanoon lagu kar sake
 On some occasions he has called himself a philosophical anarchist
 In his sense, an independent India exists with thousands of small self-sufficient communities that rule on their own without the hurdle of others

If the primary teeth are less than 1 or 2 in a human being, then it is called hypodonia problem and if the tooth is less than 6 or 6 then the condition is oligodonia
 They say Anodonia is most often characterized by a lack of wisdom teeth! anodonshia daanton kaa vah janmajaat rog he jo kii saare yaa kuch daanton main dikhaai detaa he! or isamen daant nikalne ke samay hi sanyukt daant hote he yaa kuch daanton kii kami hoti he! janam se 1 yaa adhik daanton kii kami hona saadhaaran asaamanyata he, jiske kaaran masoticater disfunction ho jaataa he, bolne main dikkat aati he, esthetic samasyae utpaan hoti he or mossoclusne bhi ho saktaa he! or kuch logo ke saamne vaale danta viksit nahi ho pate jiske kaaran wo log bhut hi gusse vaale ban jate he apni asuraksha ke kaaran! Anodonia is a genetic disease but it can also be treated! The teeth that have not developed in its treatment are replaced by artificial implant implant technique in which those teeth are applied, Jha cannot develop teeth

 Now as if Champaner wanted to crucify Bhuvan
 sabaki zindagi to ab tabah hone ja rahi thi

 After all, where would you have paid even a year's rent? And then even Captain Russell was not going to be challenged

 He took three wickets in three balls simultaneously
 goron kii pari kareeb tinsau ran par samaapt hui
 Bhuvan's team started the batting vigorously
 british sena ke bhootpurv sipaahi deva kamanaseebi se out ho gayi
 Then the British players condemned the village batsmen and threw them out and they soon started getting out

 Meanwhile, half the team was out
 magar bhuwan abhi khel me jivit tha

 The first kingdom here belonged to the prophets, who came 600 years before Christ and after a few days had captured Petra

 a similar state was known as Kinda in Central Arabia which was under the kings of the Tubba dynasty of Yemen

 When he migrated from Mecca to Madina in 622 AD, he established a new type of kingdom there
 is naveen dharm kii praarambhik shiksha kaa strot quran he
 Its initial and important teachings are three: 1
 tauhid ; 2
 Exodus; 3
 pralok arthath is nashwar sansar kaa ek antim diwas hoga or us din prayek manushya ishwar ke samaksh apane karmon kaa uttar degaa
 The important rites of this religion included reciting the Namaz for five times and performing Hajj once a year, if able to perform Hajj
 aarthik santulan kaayam rakhane ke liye prayek dhani musalmaan kaa yah kartavya mana gaya ki apni varsh bhar kii bachi hui poonji main se dhai pratishat vah deen dukhiyon kii aarthik dasha ke sudhaar ke liye de de
 The new society was designed in such a way that the Jahili Arabs, who were divided into many castes, all became united and they first conceived of nationalism
 jaahili samaaj main keval raktasambandh jati ke prayek vyakti ko ekatra rakhata tha parantu islamic samaaj main dharm tathaa bhraatrutiv kaa sambandh prayek musalmaan ko ek hi jhande ke neeche ekatrit karata tha
 In addition, the foundation of Islamic society was based on religion, brotherhood and justice without any discrimination

 Therefore, on the foundation of this new religion and society, the building of a upgraded civilization was constructed

 The divisions of the ruler and the subjects were abolished and the country was united on the basis of justice and brotherhood

 Culturally, the period of Khulafairashidin is early

 He had to bow to the conquered castes in Sam, Egypt, Iraq and Iran and accept his cultural leadership
 aitihaasik drushtikon se umavikaal jaahilikaal se adhik dur na tha, phir bhi gyaan kaa bijaropan usee kaal main hua
 Damascus, Kufa, Vasara, Mecca, Medina were important centers of early knowledge and learning

 It is true that the Arabs did not have their own culture, but they taught their religion and their language to the conquered castes and gave them such opportunities to show their gratitude
 arabon kaa sabase mahaan kaary yah he ki unhone vijit jatiyon ko saanskrithik sambhaavnaaon ko uhaada or apana dharm tathaa apni bhashaa prachlit karke unako bhi arab shabd ke arth main sammilit kar liya or vijeta tathaa vijit kaa antar samaapt ho gaya

 The Arabs translated and preserved the eroding knowledge of many ancient civilizations from the origins and propagated them wherever they went, in countries like Europe

 This advancement was due to the extent of Indian, Greek, Iranian influence
 gyaan vigyaan kii unnati kaa prarambh adhiktar anuwaadon se hua jo irani samskruti, suryani tathaa unani bhashaa se kiye gaye the
 In a short period of time the books of philosophy of Aristotle and Aflatun, the interpretations of the neo-aflatuni commentators, medical books of Jalenus, the books of the prolific Euclideus and Batlimus in Mathematics and scientific and literary books to Iran and India came under the control of Arabs
 
 atev jin shastron, vigyaanon ko seekhney main unaniyon ko shatabdiyaan lag gai thim unako arabon ne varsho main sikh liya or keval siikhaa hi nahin, unamem mahatv ke sanshodhan bhi kiye
 For this reason, Arab scientists had reached the pinnacle of progress in literary terms in medieval history

 After this, Arabs also accepted the rules of numbers and decimal fractions from mathematics from Indians
 arabi bhashaa main sarvapratham saahitiyik pustak "qa lila va dimana" he jiskaa abdulla bin mukapapha ne pahlvi se anuwaad kiya tha
 The first copy of this book was translated from Sanskrit at the time of Nausharwan
 is pustak kaa mahatv is kaaran he ki pahlvi prati kii prapti sanskrit prati ke samaan hi durlabh he, parantu ab bhi ye kahaniyaan panchtatra main vistaarpurvak mil sakati hai
 Meanwhile, the Abbasid Caliph Mamun established the Baitulahikmat in Baghdad, which was the reading room and translation house, the Knowledge Institute

 Among the Arabic translators of this time are the famous Hunain bin Ishaq and Sidh bin Kurra
