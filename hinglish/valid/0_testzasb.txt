 Small quantities of sulfur can be prepared in laboratories in the following three ways: gandhak trioxide ko jal main ghulaane se, By the direct action of hydrogen peroxide and sulfur dioxide - vaayu ke sansarg main salfuras amla ke vilyan ke mand oxikaran se
 At the industrial level, acid is produced by sis-chamber method and contact method
 sansparsh vidhi main gandhak athwa aayran salphid sadrush kisi salphid ke dahan se sulfur dioxide pehle banataa he or vah platinum dhatuyukt esbestas utprerak kii upasthiti main vaayu ke oxigen dwaara gandhak trioxide main parinat ho jaataa he, jo jal main ghulkar gandhakaml banataa he
 In this method, acid is formed by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide by nitric acid in the presence of water
 yah kriya-bade bade sis kakshon main sampann hoti he at: iskaa naam 'sis-kaksh-vidhi' padaa he
 This method was used to make a large amount of sulfuric acid, but it has some shortcomings due to which the contact process has now replaced it

 The king of that forest was a terrible demon named Hidimb
 maanvon kaa gandh milane par usne pandavon ko pakad laane ke liye apni bahan hidimba ko bheja taaki vah unhen apana aahaar bana kar apni kshudha purti kar sake
 On reaching there, Hidimba saw Bhimsen guarding him and became enamored of him by seeing his handsome Mukharvind and his body
 usne apni rakshasi maaya se ek apurv laavanmayi sundari kaa rup bana liya or bhimsen ke paas ja pahaunchi
 Bhimsen asked him, "O beautiful! Who are you and why are you wandering alone in this terrible forest at night?" In response to Bhima's question, Hidimba said, "O Narashrestha! i am a demon named Hidimba
 mere bhai ne mujhe aap logon ko pakad kar laane ke liye bheja he kintu meraa hriday aap par aasakt ho gaya he tathaa main aapako apane pati ke rup main praapt karnaa chaahati hoon
 My brother Hidimb is very wicked and cruel, but i have enough strength to save you from his clutches and reach a safe place
 " Seeing the delay in returning his sister here, Hidimb reached the place where Hidimba was talking to Bhimsen
 hidimba ko bhimsen ke saath premalap karte dekhakar vah krodhit ho uthaa or hidimba ko dand dene ke liye uski ore jhapata
 Seeing this, Bhima stopped him and said, "O evil demon! You do not feel ashamed to raise your hand on a woman? If you are so brave and mighty then fight me
 " itnaa kah kar bhimsen taal thonk kar uske saath mall yuddh karne lage
 Kunti and other Pandavas also got sleep
 vahaan par bhim ko ek rakshas ke saath yuddh karte tathaa ek rupavati kanya ko khadi dekh kar kunti ne poocha, "putree! tum koun ho?" hidimba ne sari baaten unhen bataa di
 Arjuna lifted his bow to kill Hidimba, but Bhima refused to release the arrow, "anuj! Don't leave the arrow, it is my prey and will die at my own hands
" " itnaa kah kar bhim ne hidimb ko donon haathon se pakad kar uthaa liya or use hawa main anek baar ghuma kar itani tivrata ke saath bhoomi par pataka ki uske praan-pakheru ud gayi
 After Hidimb, Bhima became the king of Kamyak forest and Bhima ruled over 20 Sam Kamyak forests
 hidimb ke marane par ve log vahaan se prasthaan kii taiyaari karne lage, is par hidimba ne kunti ke charnon main gir kar prarthana karne lagi, "he mata! maine aapke putr bhim ko apane pati ke rup main sweekaar kar liya he
 Please accept me kindly
 yadi aap logon ne majhe sweekaar nahin kiya to main isi kshan apane praanon kaa tyaag kar duungi
 "seeing a feeling of strong love for Bhima in Hidimba's heart, Yudhishthira said," Hidimbe! i entrust you to my brother, but he will only stay with you during the day and stay with us at night
 " hidimba iske liye taiyaar ho gai or bhimsen ke saath anandpurvak jivan vyateet karne lagi
 After a year, Hidimba's son was born
 utpann hote samay uske sir par kesh na hone ke kaaran uskaa naam ghatotkach rakhaa gaya
 He turned very elusive and grew up as soon as he was born
 hidimba ne apane putr ko pandavon ke paas le ja kar kaha, "yah aapke bhai kii santaan he atah yah aap logon kii seva main rahegaa
 "hidimba left after saying so

 He then took the position of Professor of Physics in the Presidency College and did many important scientific experiments even while facing caste discrimination
 inhone betaar ke sanket bhejne main asaadhaaran pragati kii or sabase pehle radio sandeshon ko pakadaney ke liye ardhchalkon kaa prayog karnaa shuru kiya
 But instead of profiting commercially from his discoveries, he published them publicly so that other researchers could work on them further
 iske baad inhone vanaspati jeevaidya main anek khojein kii
 He invented a machine crescograph and studied the response of plants to various stimulants
 is tarah se inhone siddh kiya ki vanaspatiyon or pashuon ke utakon main kaaphi samanta he

 Jagdish Chandra Bose had a great interest in biology and moved to London at the age of 22 to study medical science
 magar swasth kharaab rahane kii vajah se inhone chikitsak banane kaa vichaar tyagkar cambridge ke christ mahavidhyalay chale gayi or vahaan bhautikee ke ek vikhyath pro fadar lafont ne bose ko bhautikashastra ke adhyayan ke liye prerit kiya
 In the year 1885, he returned home and started teaching in Presidency College as Assistant Professor of Physics
 yahaan vah 1915 tak rahe
 At that time, Indian teachers were paid one third of the salary of British teachers
 iskaa jagadish chandra bose ne virodh kiya or bina vetan ke teen varshon tak kaam karte rahe, jisaki vajah se unki stithi kharaab ho gai or un par kaaphi karja ho gaya tha
 To repay this debt, he also had to sell his ancestral land
 chauthe varsh jagadish chandra bose kii jeet hui or unhen puraa vetan diya gaya
 Bose was also a good teacher who used large scale scientific demonstrations to teach in the classroom
 bose ke hi kuch chaatr jaise satendra nath bose aage chalakar prasiddh bhautikashastri bane
 British theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves of mathematically diverse wavelengths, but he died in 1879 before his prediction was validated
 british bhautikavid oliver loj maxwell tarangon ke astitv kaa pradarshan 1887-88 main taron ke saath unhen preshit karke kiya
 German physicist Heinrich Hertz experimented with the existence of electromagnetic waves in free space in 1888
 iske baad, loj ne hertz kaa kaam jari rakhaa or june 1894 main ek smaraneey vyaakhyaan diya or use pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya
 Lodge's work attracted the attention of scientists from various countries, including Bose of India
 bose ke microwave anusandhan kaa pehali ullekhneey pahalu yah tha ki unhone tarang dairdhya ko millimetre str par laa diya 
 They understood the loss of long wavelength light waves to study the properties of light
 1893 main, nicola testla ne pehle saarvajanik radio sanchaar kaa pradarshan kiya
 a year later, during a November 1894 public demonstration in Kolkata, Bose used a millimeter range microwave wave to fire ammunition and ring a bell
 leftinent governor sar wiliam maikenji ne kalakatta toun haul main bose kaa pradarshan dekha
 Bose wrote in a Bengali essay, 'invisible Light', "invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc
, so the message can be transmitted through light without wires
 " rus main popov ne aisa hi ek prayog kiya
 Bose's first scientific article "on the polarization of electric rays by double refractory crystals" was sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of the Lodge article
 unka doosraa lekh oktober 1895 main landan kii royal socity ko lard rele dwaara bheja gaya
 In December 1895, the London magazine electrician published Bose's article "on a new electro-polariscope"
 us samay angreji bolne vaali duniya main loj dwaara gadhe gaye shabd 'kohirar' k prayog hertz ke tarang resiver yaa detector ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The electrician immediately commented on Bose's 'coherer'
 
 angreji patrika electrician se uddhrut tippanee he: Bose planned to better his "coherer" but never thought about the patent
 bose ne apane prayog us samay kiye the jab radio ek sampark madhyam ke taur par viksit ho rahaa tha
 Bose's work on radio microwave optics was not related to radio communication, but the improvements he made and the facts he wrote about it influenced other radio inventors
 us daur main 1894 ke ant main guglielmo marconi ek radio system par kaam kar rahe the jo wireles telegraphy ke liye vishith rup dizine kiya ja rahaa tha
 By early 1896, the system was transmitting radio signals far beyond the range indicated by physics
 jagadishchandra bose pehle vaigyanik the jinhone radio tarange detect karne ke liye semiconductor jankshan kaa istemaal kya tha or is paddati main kai microwave components kii khoj kii thi
 After this, there was no research on electromagnetic waves of millimeter length for the next 50 years
 1897 main bose ne landan ke royal institushan main apane millimetre tarango par kiye hue shodh kii varnana di thi
 He used waveguides, horn antennas, die -lectric lenses, different polarizers and semiconductors with frequencies up to 60 ghz - in his research
 yah saare upkaran aaj bhi kolkata ke bose institute main maujuud hai
 a 1
3 mm multibeam receiver housed in Arizona's NRAO 12 meter telescope is built on the principles of the research paper written in 1897 by Acharya Bose
 sar neville mott ko 1977 main solid state electronics main kiye apane shodhakarya ke liye nobel puraskaar mila tha
 He had said that Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose was 60 years ahead of his time
 asal main bose ne hi p - tip or n - tip semiconductor ke astitv kaa purvanumaan kiya tha
 His biggest contribution in the field of biophysics was that he showed that the stimulation of plants is transmitted through the electrical medium and not through the chemical medium
 baad main in daavon ko vaigyanik proyogo ke madhyam se sach sabit kiya gaya tha
 Acharya Bose first studied the effect of microwave on vegetative tissue
 unhone paudhon par badalte hue mausam se hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Along with this, he also studied the effect of chemical inhibitors on plants and the effect of plants on changing temperatures
 alag alag paristhitiyon main cell membrane potential ke badlaav kaa vishleshan karke ve is nattejey par pahunche kii paudhe samvedansheel hote hai ve " dard mahasoos kar sakate hai, sneh anubhav kar sakate hai ityadi "
 Bose did a comparative study of fat response on different metal and plant tissues
 unhone alag alag dhaatuo ko electrical, maikenical, rasinic or thermal tareekon ke mishran se uttejit kiya tha or koshikao or dhaatu kii pratikriya ke samaantaaon ko note kiya tha
 Bose's experiments showed a cyclic fatig reaction in simulated cells and metals
 iske saath hi jivit koshikao or dhaatuo main alag alag tarah ke uttejnaaon ke liye vishesh chakree fatig or recovery rispance kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 Acharya Bose made a graph of the electrical response of changing plants with the changing electrical stimuli, and also showed that when the plants were given poison or anesthetic, their reactions started to work and became zero later
 lekin yah pratikriya zinc dhaatu ne nahin dikhaai jab use oksalik acid ke saath treet kiya gaya
 In 1917 Jagdish Chandra Bose was conferred the title of "knight" and was soon elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London for Physical and Biology
 bose ne apana puraa shodhakarya bina kisi achche upkaran or prayogshaala ke kiya tha isaliye jagadish chandra bose ek acchhee prayogshaala banane kii soch rahe the
 "bose Institute" is the result of this thinking, which is a famous center of the nation for research in science

 The nuclear syllable describes the main point of the speaker
 udhaaharan ke liye: This also yah bhaavana vyakt karne ke liye bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he: Nuclear syllables are spoken in a much louder tone, and there is a distinct change in the tone of speech
 is lahaze ke sabase saamaanya badlaav hai aawaaj ko unchaa karnaa or aawaaj ko nichaa karnaa, haalaanki girti-chadhati aawaaj or chadhati-girti aawaaj kaa bhi yada kada istemaal hota he
 The importance of raising and lowering the voice in English language is much more than other languages
 nichi aawaaj main bolnaa nischitata darshata he or unchi aawaaj main bolnaa anischitata
 iskaa arth par ek mahatvapurn prabhaav pad saktaa he, khaskar sakaaratmak athwa nakaaratmak drushtikon ko darshane main; nichi aawaaj main bolne kaa matlab he aapkaa "drushtikon gyaat" he or chadhati hui aawaaj kaa matlab "drushtikon agyaat" he
 The same is behind the rising voice of yes / no questions

 Case marking has almost disappeared from the language and today it is mainly used in pronouns
 germanik mul se praapt majboot banaam kamjor kriya ke swaroop kaa aadhunik angreji main mahatva ghat gaya he or ghumaav ke avasheshon kaa upyog bad gaya he
 Presently, the language has become more analytical and tools such as technological verbs and word order have been developed to explain the meaning
 sahaayak kriyaayen prashnon, nakaaratmakataa, pasive vois or pragatisheel pahaluon ko darshaati hai
 Since English is a Germanic language, most of its daily usage vocabulary comes from ancient German
 iske atirikt bhi angrezi main kai rinshabd hai
 According to a survey, the situation is: angreji shabdaawalee sadiyaan bitne ke saath kaaphi badal gayi he
 Like many languages from proto-indo-european, the origin of the most common English words can be traced to the PIE
 in shabdon main shaamil hai buniyadi sarvnaam ' jaise ai, puraani angreji ke shabd isi se,, me, sankhyayen ", duo, tris), saamaanya paariwarik sambandh jaise kii mata, pita, bhai, bahan aadi, kai jaanwaron ke naam or kai aam kriyaayen 
 Germanic words are shorter than Latin words in English and they are more common in common colloquial usage
 isamen lagbhag sabhi buniyadi sarvnaam, purvasarg, sanyojak, dyotak kriyaayen aadi shaamil hai jo kii angreji ke buniyadi vaakyavinyas or vyakaran ko banaati hai
 Longer Latin words are often considered more ornate and educated
 haalaanki latin shabdon ke zarurat se zyada prayog ko dikhaawati athwa mudda chhipaane kii ek koshish mana jaataa he
 George Orwell's essay "politics and English" criticizes this and other alleged misuse of language
 is niabandh ko angreji bhashaa kii ek mahatvapurn samiksha mana jaataa he
 An English speaker is allowed to choose from Latin and Germanic synonyms: less or arrives; Site or vision; Freedom or Liberty
 In some cases, there is an option to choose from a Germanic derived word, a Latin derived word and a French word derived from the same Latin word
 vividh arthon or baarikiyon ko samete ye paryaayavachi shabd vaktaaon ko baariq bhed or vichaaron kii bhinnata ko vyakt karne main sahaayak hote hai
 Knowledge of the history of synonyms can give English speakers greater control over their language
 dekhen: angreji main jarmenic or latin samakakshon kii soochi
 There is an exception and a feature that is probably only found in the English language
 vah yah he kii, gosht kii sangya aamtaur par use pradaan karne vaale jaanavar kii sangya se bhinn or asambandhit hoti he
 The animal usually has a Germanic name and the meat is derived from the French
 udahaaran, hiran or venisan ; gaay or bif ; boar / pig or pork, tathaa bhed or matan 
 ise norman akraman kaa parinaam mana jaataa he, jahaan anglo-sexn nimna varg dwaara pradaan kiye gaye gosht ko french bolne vaale abhijaat varg ke log khate the

 Their synergy is better in context and in many cases they do not even appear to be Latin
 udahaaran, ye sabhi shabd latin hai: pahaad, tarai, nadi, chachee, chachaa, chalanaa, upyog dhakka or rahanaa 
 English readily accepts technical words and often imports new words and sentences
 iske udahaaran hai, samakaleen shabd jaise kii kuki, internet or URL ,jiner, uber, lingua franca or emigo 
 iske alaava, theth shabd aksar puraane shabdon or vaakyanshon ko nayaa arth pradaan karte hai
 In fact, this fluidity is so obvious that there is often a need to distinguish between the contemporary usage of English and its formal types

 there is absolutely no defining line in any direction: the circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no discernible circumference
 The English vocabulary is undoubtedly vast, but assigning a number to it would come under more definition than calculation
 Unlike the French, German, Italian and Spanish languages, there is no academy to define officially accepted words and quantities for the English language

 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 The architecture of India is a mixture of traditional and external influences
 bhartiya vaastu kii visheshta yahan kii deevaaron ke utkrisht or prachur alankaran main he
 The scheme of frescoes and sculptures, which in addition to ornamentation, expresses a serious sense of its subject, sometimes completely envelops the building from the outside

 Two-three thousand years BC The discovery of the developed Indus Valley Civilization has brought to light a surprising fact that the oldest art of India was as aesthetic as any other civilization
 jab aajkal kii koi bhi sabhyataa jaagran kii angadaai bhi na le pai thi tab bharat kii yah kala itani viksit thi
 The town planning knowledge of the makers of these settlements was so mature, the materials used by them were of such excellent quality and the composition was so strong that the beginning of that civilization is bound to be considered long ago, about four five thousand years, BC

 Nevertheless, such a grotesque start to the history of end-to-end enriched Indian life with remarkable brilliance and excellent architectural expectation as well as more exploration, linking its link with the Aryan civilization, which is considered more ancient

 There are many legends behind the Maya and mystery of historical buildings of India
 madhya bharat ke kuch sarvshereshth mandir ek kaalpanik rajkumaar janakacharya dwaara banaae kahe jate hai, jise brahmahatya ke praayshchitt swaroop bees varsh is kaam main lagane pade the
 According to another legend, these extraordinary buildings were not built by the Pandavas in a single night

 These tableau of Buddhist, Jain Vastu, Hindu Vastu, and Dravidian Vastu evolving together in the country are proof of the traditional religious tolerance of the vast India
 vaastukala par musalamaanon ke akraman kaa jitna prabhaav bharat main padaa utana anyatra kahin nahin, kyonki jis sabhyataa se muslim sabhyataa kii takkar hui, kisi se uskaa itnaa virodh nahin tha jitna bhartiya sabhyataa se
 Compared to the prestigious Indian social and religious trends, Muslim civilization was completely new, its fundamental principles were also different
 donon kaa sangharsh yatharthwaad kaa adarshavaad se, vaastaviktaa kaa swapndarshita se or vyakt kaa avyakt se sangharsh tha, jiskaa pramaan masjid or mandir ke bhed main spasht he
 The mosques are open, their center is in the direction of distant Mecca; While the temple is a house of mystery, the center of which is the middle devasthan or sanctum sanctorum surrounded by many walls and corridors
 majisd kii deevaaren praaia: saadi yaa pavitra aayaton se utkeern hoti hai, unamem maanav akritiyon kaa chithran nishiddh hota he; jabaki mandiron kii deevaaron main murtikla or maanavkruti chithran ucchtam shikhar par pahunchaa, par likhaai kaa naam na tha
 This depiction of the simple colors of the stones brought alive to the temples; Whereas the walls were articulated in the mosques by colorful stones, marble and painting plastered plaster

 Consequently, apart from religious buildings, such as mosques, tombs, rajas and dargahs, a variety of secular buildings, such as palaces, pavilions, nagarwadars, wells, gardens and large forts, were built up to the enclaves encircling the entire city
 desh main uttar se dakshin tak jaise jaise muslim prabhtv badhata ga, vaastukala kaa yug bhi badalata gaya
 Three successive stages of Muslim Vastu are evident
 pehla charan, jo bahut thode samay rahaa, vijaydarp or dharmandhta se prerit "nirmulan" kaa tha, jiske bare main hasan nizami likhata he ki prayek kila jeetne ke baad uske stambh or neenv tak mahakay haathiyon ke pairon tale rondwakar dhul main mila dene kaa rivaaj tha
 Many forts, cities and temples were made non-existent in this way

 The final phase began when Akranta was thoroughly awakened in many parts and he created well-crafted and exquisite architecture through planned construction rather than replacement
 shaileyon kii drushti se bhi muslim vaastu ke teen varg ho sakate hai
 The first is the Delhi style, or Shahanshahi style, often called "pathan Vastu"
 is varg main dilli kii qutubameenar, sultan gadhi, altamash kaa makbara, alaai daravaaza, nizamuddin, gayasuddin tughlaq or ferojshah tughlaq ke makbare, kotla ferojshah, mubarakashah kaa makbara, meerut kii masjid, shershah kii masjid sahasaram kaa shershah kaa makbara or ajmer kaa adhaai din kaa jhonpada aadi ullekhneey hai
 The second category consists of provincial styles

 The third category includes the Mughal style, the finest specimens of which exist in the form of forts, tombs, palaces, garden pavilions etc
 in Delhi, Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Lucknow, Lahore etc

 saanchaa:kharaab masini anuwaad In quantum mechanics, an atomic orbital is a mathematical function that describes the wave-like behavior of either an electron or a pair of electrons in an atom
 is samaaroh main ek parmaanu ke kisi bhi electron paane kii sambhaavna kii gananaa karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa parmaanu ke nabhik ke chaaron ore kisi bhi vishisht kshetra main
 The term, atomic orbital, can also refer to the physical region or location where the electron, as the orbital, can be calculated to present a special mathematically defined presence
 ek parmaanu main prayek kakshiya teen kwantum sankhya n, l, or meter ke mulyon, jo kramshah electron kii urja, koniya gati, or ek koniya gati vector ghatak ke anuroop kii ek adwitiya set kii visheshta he
 In this way each orbital with two electrons can have its own spin quantum number occupied by a maximum of each
 parmaanu kakshaon parmaanu kakshiya model, is maamle main electronon kii upasookshm vyavhaar visshavalayisig ke liye ek aadhunik dhaanche kii buniyadi imaarat blokon hai
 The electron cloud of a multi-electron atom being constructed in this model can be seen as an electron configuration that is a product of simple hydrogen-like atomic orbitals kwantum yantriki or prayogtmak nishkarshon ke vikaas ke saath, yah paaya gaya he ki ek nabhik ke chaaron ore parikrama electronon ko puri tarah se kanon ke rup main varnit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, lekin lahar kan dwandv se samajhaayaa ja karne kii jarurat he
 In this sense, electrons have the following properties: lahar kii tarah gun:1
 electronon ek grah surya kii parikrama ke arth main nabhik ke chaaron ore chakkar nahin he, lekin iske bajaay khadey tarangon ke rup main maujuud hai
 The lowest possible energy an electron can carry is therefore corresponding to the fundamental frequency of a wave on a wire
 ucch urja rajyon to moulik aavriti ke layaaddh ke samaan hai

 Electrons are never in a point location, although the possibility of interaction with the electron at a single point can be found by the wave function of the electron
 kan- jaise gun:1

electrons jump between orbits in a particle-like fashion
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar ek photon electronon hamalon, keval ek hi electron parivartan photone ke jawaab main kaha gaya he

 Particle-like properties to retain electrons: Each wave state is in charge of the same electric charge as the electron particle

yah apane souparposishan par nirbhar kar saktaa he
 Thus, despite the apparent resemblance to planets revolving around the Sun, electrons cannot be described as just solid particles
 iske alaava, parmaanu kakshaon baariki se saadhaaran parmaanuon main ek grah kii andakar path samaan nahin he
 a more precise analogy may be that a large and often oddly shaped "atmosphere" is distributed around a relatively small planet
 parmaanu kakshaon vastav main is " vaataavaran" ke aakaar kaa varnan he jab keval ek electron ek parmaanu main maujuud he
 The more electrons are added to an atom, the more electrons fill a volume of space more evenly around the nucleus so that the resulting collection leads to a generally spherical region to describe the possibility
 For where atoms will get electrons
 anischitata principal kii vajah se he
 Atomic orbitals can be hydrogen-like "orbitals" which are exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen-like "atom"
 vaikalpik rup se, parmaanu kakshaon kaary karata he ki ek electron ke samanvay par nirbhar karti he lekin lahar kaary karata he ki ek parmaanu yaa anu main sabhi electronon kaa ek saath nirdeshaank par nirbhar anumaan karne ke liye ank shuru karne ke rup main istemaal kar rahe hai ke liye dekhen
 The coordinate system chosen for atomic orbitals is typically spherical coordinates of atoms and molecules in polyatomic in Cartesian
 golakaar nirdeshaank kaa laabh ek kakshiya lahar samaaroh teen karkon prayek nirbhar kaa ek utpaada he us par ek bhi samanvay sthapit he : ψ = r θ φ 
 Angular factors of atomic orbitals θ φ generate s, p, d, etc
 Functions as real combinations of spherical rhythms Ylm shabd " kakshiya " ek electron kakshiya lahar samaaroh ke liye ek sankshipt naam ke rup main 1932 main robert mullikkan dwaara gadha gaya tha
 However, the idea that electrons may revolve around a compact nucleus with fixed angular momentum was argued at least 19 years ago by Niels Bohr, and an orbit-based approach to electronic behavior by Japanese physicist Hanataro Ngoka The hypothesis published as early as 1904 explained the behavior of electron "orbits" as the driving force behind the development of quantum One of the wing forces was mechanics
 je je ke saath 1897 main electron kii thomson kii khoj, yah spasht ho gaya he ki parmaanu prakruti ke sabase chote blokon kaa nirmaan nahin the, balki samgr kanon the
 Many examinations imagine the structure of newly discovered structures within atoms, how atomic component parts may interact with each other
 thomson ne anumaan lagaaya he ki kai electronon ek sakaaratmak aarope lagaaya jelly jaisaa padaarth ke bheetar kaksha - tarah ke challe main gumti he, or electron kii khoj or 1909 ke bich, is " ber kaa halava model" parmaanu sanrachana kaa sabase vyapak rup se sweekaar vivaran tha
 Shortly after Thomson's discovery, Hanataaro Nagaoka predicted a different model for electronic structure
 ber kaa halava model ke vipareet, nagaoka ke " saturnean model" main sakaaratmak charge ek kendriya kor main kendrit tha ,shani ke challe kii yaad taaja paripatr kakshaon main electronon khinch
 Some people took notice of Nagioka's work at the time, and Nagaoka himself also recognized in principle a fundamental flaw on his concept, namely that it is a classical charged object because it is fast not to maintain orbital motion
 And therefore loses energy due to electromagnetic radiation
 phir bhi, saturnean model niklaa apane samakalinon kii tulana main kisi bhi aadhunik siddhant ke saath aam main adhik he
 The orbits are named as: "X type" where the x energy level corresponds to the principal quantum number n type is a subset of a lower case shape or orbital and it corresponds to the angular quantum number l, and y That is the number of electrons in the orbital
 udhaaharan ke liye, kakshiya 1s2 do electronon he or sabase kam urja str he or l kii ek koniya kwantum sankhya = 0
 In X-ray notation, the principal quantum number is a given letter associated with it

 The simplest atomic orbitals are those that are computed for systems with an electron, such as a hydrogen atom
 ek electron ke liye neeche ynit kisi bhi anya tatv ke ek parmaanu bahut hydrogen ke samaan he, or kakshaon main ek hi rup le lo
 In the Schrödinger equation for this system of a negative and positive one particle, atomic orbitals are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator for energy
 ve vishleshnatmak praapt kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa arth he ki jiske parinamswaroop kakshaon bahupad shrinkhalaa ke utpaadon, or ghaateey or trikoshmetiya kaary kar rahe hai For atoms with two or more electrons, the governing equation can only be solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation
 bahu electron parmaanuon kii kakshaon main gunatmak hydrogen ke un logon ke liye samaan hai, or saral model main, ve ek hi farm ke liye liya jaataa he
 For more rigorous and accurate analysis, numerical approximations should be used
 ek parmaanu main ek crystalia thos kai variya kulhadiyon kaa maananaa he ambeded he, lekin koi pasandida disha
 Instead of building atomic orbitals outside the product of radial functions and a single spherical harmonic, linear combinations of spherical rhythms are typically used, so that the imaginary part of spherical harmonics cancel out
 ye asli kakshaon imaarat blokon sabase adhik kakshiya drushyavlokan main dikhaaya jaataa he
 In real hydrogen-like orbitals, for example, n and l have the same interpretation and significance as their complex counterparts, but m is no longer a good quantum number
 kakshaon ek manakikrut kartiya aadhaar ke liye sammaan ke saath unke aakaar ke aadhaar par nae naam die gaye hai
 In atoms with an energy of one electron, an orbital is specifically chosen n
 n = 1 kakshiya parmaanu main sambhav sabase kam urja he
 Each successively higher value of n has a higher level of energy, but n increases as the difference decreases
 ucch n ke liye, urja kaa str itnaa adhik he ki electron aasaani se parmaanu se batch sakate ho jaataa he
 In single electron atoms, there are n within all levels with different l degenerate, have the same energy
 
 This approximation is broken to a minor extent by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus and by the quantum electric effect
 uttararddh vishesh rup se electronon ki nabhik najadik janaa he, kyonki ye ek bahut thodaa alag parmaanu prabharee lag rahaa he, yahaan tak ki ek electron parmaanuon main chote bandhan urja matbhedon ko prerit In atoms with many electrons, the energy of an electron depends not only on the intrinsic properties of its orbit, but also on its interaction with other electrons
 in mulakaaton apane sthanik sambhaavna vitaran ke vistaar par nirbhar karti he, or isliye kakshaon kii urja ke str par hi nahin n lekin yah bhi par l nirbhar karte hai
 Favors are associated with higher values of energy; For example, the 2p state is higher than the 2s state
 jab l=2 kakshiya kii urja main vruddhi itani badi ho jaati es- kakshiya agle ucch khol main kii urja upar kakshiya kii urja ko push karne ke rup main ; jab l=3 urja khol main do charnon ucch dhakel diya he
 Filling of 3D orbitals does not occur until 4s orbitals have been filled

 Piston engines have been used to run all types of motor vehicles, air and water vessels
 din prati din in injanon main nai nai khoj hoti rahi or inase adhik se adhik shakti praapt hone lagi
 The demands of more rapid movement of these machines have led to the appraisal of these engines that their further development is no longer possible
 saath hi saath is unnati ke kaaran inaki mashine itani ulajh gayi ki inaki suvidha se bananaa or upyog karnaa kathin ho gaya
 Hence the use of gas turbine, due to which the speed of air and water vessels was greatly increased

 to isaki chaal adhik tej hogi
 The reason for this vehicle to run in this way is said here that when the gas comes out of the hole, it hits the air outside and that is why the vehicle moves forward, but this is not the case
 yadi ise bina hawa ke sthaan par chalaaya jaay to isaki chaal or bhi teevr hogi
 So it is only the reaction that drives it

 Whereas more speed was required, tilting was used

 jalane ke samay eendhan or hawa kii nishpati adhik hoti he or jab mashin chal padati he to hawa kaa mishran adhik ho jaataa he
 The gas produced by the burning of air and fuel is given more speed
 gas ko adhik gati usee samay mil sakati he jab use thik prakaar se failane kaa avasar diya jaae
 But the pressure of the gas will decrease in this spread, because the gas has to be released in the same air from where the air was drawn in to mix with the fuel
 isliye daab ke ghatane se puri shakti praapt na hogi
 As long as there is no full pressure behind the gas, propulsion will not be able
 at: gas ke peeche puri daab praapt karne ke liye sampidak mashin kii vyavastha kii jaati he
 a gas turbine is installed to run this compressor
 hawa ko sampidak baahar se khinchakar tarabine kii ore puure bal kesath phenkata he
 The fuel is mixed between the turbine and the compressor in this air and this mixture is given an opportunity to burn
 iske jalane se aaytan tathaa taap ek hi daab par badhate hai
 This power is so much that it can run the turbine and it also has full kinetic energy for its operation
 sampidak hawa ko khinchakar dahan kothriyon ko detaa he, jahaan eendhan pehle se jalataa hua miltaa he or yah gas adhik taap par tarabine ko jaati he
 The turbine runs from this gas and it also drives the turbine compressor
 tarabine se nikalakar yah gas kship kii bhanti failati hui adhik daab par baahar nikalati he
 This turbine consumes less fuel than other engines at running time, but at increased speeds it takes less fuel from all engines
 oonchaai par pahunchakar to yah or bhi kam eendhan kharch karata he
 The speed of the airplane operating from this turbine is not required
 samay kii bachat or lambii yatraaon ke liye aavashyak he ki hawaii jahaaj kaa vajan kam ho or gati adhik
 This can happen if the airplane only has tarnishing in which turbines are not used
 isaki mashin main bahut se kal purajon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 This machine has only three parts
 pehla bhaag aage kaa he jisame hawa ke liye kapaat hai or eendhan kii nalee he jiske dwaara pump se eendhan bheetar phenkaa jaataa he
 Due to timely opening of these valves, air enters
 yah kapaat us samay band hote hai jab eendhan or hawa jalakar gas ban jaati he
 The fuel bursts and the gas escapes
 doosraa bhaag dahan kothri kaa he or teesraa bhaag ingine ke peeche kii naalee kaa he, jisaki lambaai ingine kii shakti ke anusaar rakhi jaati he
 When it has to be run, fuel is first sprayed and set on fire
 is samay hawa ke kapaat khul jate hai or hawa bheetar aakar eendhan ke saath mil jaati he
 Adulteration is done properly
 eendhan or hawa kaa mishran lagbhag 2 milicenkad main jal jaataa he or iskaa taap 250 sein
 or daab 100 pratishat bad jaati he
 Now this gas goes towards the drain so it spreads before going into the drain
 jab yah naalee main jaati he to naalee kaa vyas chota hone ke kaaran iskaa taap 9000 sein
 or daab ghatakar 95 pratishat ho jaati he
 The time it takes to get out of the closet can be 8 milliseconds
 is prakaar eendhan or hawa ke mishran se utpann dhadaaka ek duusare ke pashchaat jaldi jaldi hoti he
 On the force of this blast and the rapid exit of the gas, the machine is found for propulsion
 eendhan ko pehle bijli se jalaayaa jaataa he, kintu mashin ke chalane par dahan kothri itani tap jaati he ki eendhan apane aap hi jal jaataa he
 The length of the fuel drain is kept so that the gas bursts out before the air valve opens
 is prakaar kii mashiinon kaa upyog aapse aap chalanevaale bamgolon main kiya gaya tha or ab hawaii jahaajon main kiya jaataa he, parantu isak chalaane ke liye lambey sthaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or chalane ke samay isaki gati adhik honi chahie
 It was previously thought that replacing the piston engine would not require much tomorrow if it was used to replace the piston engine, but it did not
 kshippranodan ke upyog ke saath hi yah pataa chalaa ki keval eendhan ke panpon ko badi saavdhaanee se bananaa he or eendhan tathaa hawa kaa niyantran thik rakhana nitant aavashyak hai
 Suppose the volume of gas released is per second and its speed is c
 mashin ko chalaanevaali shakti m x ga hui
 If the area of the exit point of the gas is q, then there will be two pressures at this place, one is the pressure of the exiting gas which is Ni 1 and the other is the pressure of air at this place, say, Ni 2
 ye donon daaben ek duusare ke viruddh hongi
 Hence the pressure at this place will be q which will work with mx c
 isliye pranodan kii puri shakti = m x ga + ksha hogi
 If the gas exit hole is made so that the pressure spreads to the gas, then Ni1 = Ni2, so power = m x c
 yahi pranoday kaa samirkan kaha jaataa he
 The performance ratio of propulsion can be shown from the following equation
 jahaan ga kship kii gati he or r mashin ke chalane kii gati
 This working ratio would be greatest if c = r, that is, if the speed of the machine is equal to the speed of the speed
