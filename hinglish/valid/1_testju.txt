 udhyam sansaadhan yojana ek company-vyapee computer software pranali he jiskaa upyog saajha data bhandaron dwaara sabhi sansadhano, soochna or vyapaar sambandhi prakaaryon ke samanvay or prabandhan hetu hota he
 An ERP system has a service-oriented architecture consisting of modular hardware and software units and "services" that communicate over a local area network
 yah anukhandit dizin ek vyapaar ko data akhandta ko banaaye rakhte hue anukhandon ko jodne yaa parivartit karne kii anumati pradaan karata he, ek saajha databes main jo centrestha athwa vitarit saktaa he

 To be called an ERP system, a software package must provide the functions of at least two systems
 For example, a software package that provides both salary and accounting functions may technically be called an ERP software package
 ek ERP main anukhandon ke udaahranon main, jo pehle swatantra aplicoshan hua karte the, shaamil hai: utpaada jivan-chakra prabandhan, aapurti shrinkhalaa prabandhan, godaam prabandhan, graahak sambandh prabandhan, bikri aadesh prasanskaran, online bikri, vittiya, maanav sansaadhan or nirnay samarthan pranali
 Some organizations — typically those with sufficient internal IT capabilities to integrate software products — choose to implement only parts of an ERP system and develop external interfaces to ERP or independent systems for their other application requirements
 Huh

 This is common for retailers, where a medium-sized retailer will also have a discrete point of sale product and financial applications and then a range of specific applications for warehouse management, employee inventory, merchandising and logistics

 MRP transitioned to ERP when "routings" became a major part of the software architecture, and a company's capacity planning activity also became a part of standard software activities
 ERP pranaliyaan aamtaur par company ke nirmaan, loujistics, vitaran, maal, nauvahan, chaalaan or lekha kaa prabandhan karti hai
 ERP software can assist in the control of many business activities such as sales, marketing, distribution, billing, production, goods management, quality management and human resource management

 adhikansh ERP vikritaon ke software package main sarvshereshth pranaaliyon kaa samaayojan rahata he
 When implementing an ERP system, organizations can choose between customizing the software, or modifying their business processes to conform to the "best practices" in the software
 ERP se pehle software kaa vikaas vyapaarik prakriyaaon ke anusaar hota tha
 Due to the complexity of most ERP systems and the negative consequences of failure in ERP implementation, most vendors have incorporated "best practices" into their software
 vikreta ke anusaar ye "sarvottam prathaen" ek ekikrut udhyam-vyapee pranali main kisi vishisht vyapaarik prakriya ke liye sabase kargar tarika hoti hai
 a study by the Lugwigshafen University of Applied Science surveyed 192 companies and concluded that companies that have implemented industry best practices have declined in important project tasks such as configuration, documentation, testing and training
 iske alaava, sarvottam prathaon ke upyog se anya softwaron kii tulana main jokhim main 71% se adhik kii kami aayi
 The use of best practices makes compliance with requirements such as IFRS, sarbanes-oxley or Basel II easier
 ve vahaan bhi madad kar sakati hai jahaan prakriya electronic dhan hastantaran jaisi ek vastu ho
 aisa isliye he kyonki vidhaayi or camodity saamagree ko pakadaney or report karne kii prakriya ko ERP software ke andar aasaani se kodit kiya ja saktaa he or tatpashchaat vishwaas ke saath unhen un tamaam vyavsaayon main doharaaya ja saktaa he jinaki vyavsaayik aavashyaktaaen samaan hon
 All functional units of businesses have a wide scope of applications and processes; ERP software systems are produced that are typically complex and demand significant changes in the working practices of employees
 ERP software kaa kriyanvayan "aatanrik" kaushal ke liye aam taur par bahut jatil hota he, isliye yah vaanchhneeya bhi he or isaki salaah bhi di jaati he ki in pranaaliyon ko lagu karne hetu peshewar rup se prashikshit bahya salaahkaaron kii madad lee jaye
 yah aamtaur par laagat kam karne kaa sabase prabhavi tarika he
 There are three types of services that can be hired - counseling, adaptation and support
 The duration of implementing an ERP system depends on the size of the business, the number of modules, the extent of customization, the scope of change and the customer's willingness to assume ownership of the project
 ERP pranaliyaan anukhandit hoti hai, atah yah aavashyak nahin he ki inako ek hi baar main lagu kiya jaye
 inhen vibhinn staron yaa charnon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 a typical project requires approximately 14 months and around 150 consultants
 ek choti pariyojna ko 3-9 maheene ke bheetar yojanabaddh karke lagu kiya ja saktaa he; jabaki, ek bade, bahu-kshetreey or bahu-deshiy karyanvayan main varshon lag sakate hai
 The duration of the implementation depends very much on the desired amount of customization
 ERP pranaaliyon ke karyanvayan hetu companiyaan aksar ERP vikreta yaa tritiy-paksh paraamarsh companiyon kii sahaayta leti hai
 These companies typically provide professional services in three areas: consulting, customization and support
 Customer organizations can employ independent program management, business analysis, change management and UAT specialists to ensure that their business needs remain a priority during implementation
 ek ERP karyanvayan kii safalataa kaa nirdhaaran karne main data sthanantaran sabase mahatvapurn gatividhiyon main se ek he
 As many important decisions are taken before transfer, it becomes necessary to proceed in a very planned manner
 durbhagyavash, data pravaas ek ERP karyanvayan ke utpaadan charan se pehle kii aakhri gatividhi hoti he, atah samay kii kami ke kaaran isapar bahut kam dhyaan diya jaataa he
 The following steps of data migration strategies can be helpful for the success of an ERP implementation: ERP vikritaon ne apni pranaaliyon ko maanak vyapaar prakriyaaon ke anusaar dizin kiya he, sarvottam vyavsaayik paddatiyon ke aadhaar par
 alag vikritaon kii prakriyaayein alag prakaar kii hoti hai lekin ve sabhi ek maanak, anukhandit prakruti kaa hi anusaran karti hai
 As a result, companies that want to implement ERP systems are forced to adapt their organizations to standard procedures rather than customizing ERP packages according to their existing processes
 ERP karyanvayan shuru karne se pehle vartmaan vyavsaayik prakriyaaon kaa nakshaa banane kii upeksha, ERP pariyojnaon kii vifaltaa kaa ek mukhya kaaran he
 It is important that organizations conduct a thorough analysis of business processes before selecting and implementing an ERP vendor
 This analysis should map all the existing business processes, so that an ERP vendor whose standard modules are most closely associated with the established organization is selected
 Redesign can then be implemented to achieve greater procedural integration
 shodh yah ingit karata he ki vyavsaayik prakriyaaon main bemail ke jokhim ko nimnlikhit ke dwaara kam kiya ja saktaa he: ERP implementation is more difficult in organizations where there are almost independent business units, each unit being responsible for its own losses, as they each have separate processes, business rules, data semantics, authority hierarchies and decision centers
 Occur
 samaadhaanon main shaamil hai, sthaneey parivartan prabandhan peshewaron dwaara aavashyaktaaon kaa samanvay yaa, yadi yah sambhav na ho, shithil ekikrut udaahranon kaa upyog karte hue sanghabaddh karyanvayan jinhen sthaneey aavashyaktaaon kii purti hetu vishesh taur par vinyast or / yaa anukool banaaya gaya ho
 One disadvantage of ERP is commonly reported that the transformation of business processes to match standardized ERP modules can lead to a decrease in competitive superiority
 pralekhith sakshya maujuud he jahaan vastav main aisa hua, jabaki anya maamle darshaate hai ki ERP prakriyaaon kaa purnataa se anusaran sthai pratispardhaatmak shreshthata ko vastav main badha saktaa he
 Configuring an ERP system is basically just balancing between what you want the system to do and how the system allows you to work
 shuruyaat is baat se karen ki kin anukhandon ko sthapit karnaa he, tatpashchaat apni company kii prakriyaaon ke saath sarvshereshth sambhav samaayojan hetu, vinyas talikaon ke upyog se pranali ko samanvit karen
 Modules - Most systems are modulated only so that some functions can be implemented, but others are not
 vitt or lekha jaise kuch saamaanya anukhand lagbhag sabhi companiyon dwaara apanaae jate hai; jabaki maanav sansaadhan prabandhan jaise anya anukhandon kii aavashyaktaa companiyon ko nahin hoti, isliye unhen nahin apanaaya jaataa he
 For example, a service provider might not need a construction module
 Many times companies do not adopt any module because they have their own system which is better for them
 saamanytah, jitne adhik anukhandon kaa chayan kiya jaayegaa, ekikaran laabh main utani hi vruddhi hogi, lekin saath hi laagat, jokhim or sambandhit parivartanon main bhi vruddhi aayegi
 Configuration Tables - a configuration table enables a company to customize a specific aspect of the system according to the way its business is selected
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek sanghathan maal-suchi lekhankan ke prakaar kaa- fifo yaa lifo- chayan kar saktaa he, yaa vah rajasav kii pahchaan kiske dwaara karnaa chahat he- bhugolic ikai, utpaada, yaa vitaran channel
 What happens when the options provided by the system are not appropriate? In such a situation, the company has two options, but both are not ideal
 vah udhyam pranali kooton ko punah likh sakati he, yaa maujuuda pranali kaa istemaal karti rahe or iske tathaa nayi udhyam pranali ke bich anuphaalak banaaye
 donon vikalp karyanvayan prakriya kii laagat or samay ko badhaayenge
 iske alaava ve is pranali ke ekikaran laabh ke mahatv ko bhi kam kar sakate hai
 The greater the amount of system optimization, the lower the ease of communication between suppliers and customers
 kai sanghathanon ke paas ERP pariyojna ko lagu karne ke liye paryaapt aantarik kaushal nahin tha
 As a result, many organizations started providing consulting services for ERP implementation
 Typically, a consulting team was responsible for the entire ERP implementation, including planning, training, testing, implementation, and delivery of customized modules
 Examples of customization include additional product training; Creating process promoters and workflows; Expert advice on how to use ERP in business; System optimization; And aid writing reports, complex data findings or business intelligence implementation
 adhikansh madhyam aakaar vaali companiyon ke liye karyanvayan kii laagat, ERP upyogkarta license kii likhit keemat se lekar uske dogune tak ho sakati he 
 badi companiyaan, vishesh rup bahu-kshetreey yaa bahu-deshiy companiyaan, kriyaanvayan ke liye aksar upyogkarta license kii laagat se kaaphi adhik kharch karti hai- bahu-kshetreey karyanvayan ke liye teen se ponch guna tak kharch asaamaanya nahin he
 Unlike most single-purpose applications, ERP packages include full source code from the beginning and are shipped with vendor-supported team ides for customization and expansion of illumination code
 ERP ke praarambhik varshon ke dauraan, jab ek sambhavit graahak swayan ke anuthe samaadhaan kaa aatanrik rup se vikaas karne par vichaar kar rahaa hota tha, yaa "sarvshereshth nasl" ke kai aplications ke ekikaran dwaara prakaarya-vyapee samaadhaan ko ekatra kar rahaa hota tha, us vakt paripakv upkarnon kii guarantee or vyapak anukulan ke liye sahaayta ek mahatvapurn bikri tark hua karata tha
 ERP vendors have tried to reduce customization requirements by providing pre-existing "configuration" features to meet the need for customers to change how the core system works as soon as they exit the packing box
 anukulan or vinyas ke bich mukhya antaron main shaamil hai: According to this analysis, simulating an ERP package can be unexpectedly expensive and complex, and may delay the realization of the obvious benefits of an integration system
 tathaapi, ek ERP suut kaa anurupan, vishisht kshetron main utkrushtataa ke liye gupt takneekon ko lagu karne kii gunjaaish pradaan karata he, saath hi yah sunishchit karata he ki kam samvedansheel kshetron main udyog jagat kii sarvottam prathaon ko lagu kiya ja sake
 In this context, "expansion" refers to the means by which the evoked ERP environment can be enhanced by third-party programs
 ERP ke adhikansh aadan-pradaan ko bahari kaaryakramon ke samaksh kholana takneekee rup se aasaan he, udhaaharan, xxrep 4 
 Since ERP applications usually involve complex rules that control the creation and transformation of master data, the implementation of some scenarios becomes very difficult
 rakrakhaav or sahaayak sevaaon main shaamil hai, ek sanchaalan ERP pranali kii nigaraanee or prabandhan
 yah prakaarya aamtaur par iti vibhaag ke sadasyon kii sahaayta se aatanrik rup se pradaan kiya jaataa he, yaa ek bahari visheshgy paraamarsh or seva company dwaara bhi pradaan kiya ja saktaa he
 In the absence of an ERP system, a large manufacturer may have multiple software applications that are unable to communicate or interface effectively with each other
 Functions that interface with each other include: ERP pranali, data ko ek sthaan par centrestha karti he
 Its benefits include: kuch suraksha suvidhaayen ek ERP pranali main shaamil rahati hai taaki audyogic jasusi jaise bahari aparaadh or gaban jaise andruni aparaadh ke viruddh suraksha pradaan kii ja sake
 udhaaharan ke liye data se ched-chhaad kaa ek paridrishy yah ho saktaa he, ek asantusht karmchaaree jaanboojhkar keemton ko unke nimnatam str ke neeche rakh rahaa ho taaki company ke munaafe se ched-chhaad kii ja sake yaa anya kisi prakaar se nuksaan pahunchaaya ja sake
 ERP pranaliyaan aamtaur par is prakaar ke krityon ke viruddh aantarik niyantran kii suvidha pradaan karti hai
 ERP vendors are moving towards better integration with other types of information security tools

 Key: Congress BJP Teras TDP YSR Congress AIMIM vacant kunjee: congress bhaajapa teraas tedepa wiesar congress eimm According to Dasharatha Valmiki Ramayana, Raghuvanshi was the king of Ayodhya
 vah ikshvaku kul ke the tathaa prabhu shriram, jo ki vishnu kaa avatar the, ke pita the
 The character of Dasharatha depicts the ideal Maharaja, the father who loves sons and a person fully devoted to his words
 unki teen patniyaan thim – kaushalya, sumitra tathaa kaikeyi
 Shanta Maharishi, the adopted daughter of King Romapada of Angadesh or Chitraratha, was the wife of Rishyasringa
 ek prasang ke anusaar shaanta dasharath kii putree thim tathaa romapad ko god di gayin thim
 Dasaratha reached middle age but there was no descendant of his son Rupi to support his dynasty
 unhone putr kaamana ke liye ashwamedh yajna tathaa putrakameshti yajna karaane kaa vichaar kiya
 One of his ministers Sumantra advised him to perform this yagya with his son-in-law Rishyashrunga or in common parlance to Shringi Rishi
 dasharath ke kul guru brahmarshi vashishtha the
 He was also their religious teacher and religious minister
 unke saare dharmik anushthanon kii adhyakshata karne kaa adhikaar keval dharm guru ko hi tha
 Therefore, after taking the order of Vashistha, Dashrath invited Shringi Rishi to preside over the yagna
 shrungi rishi ne donon yajna bhali bhaanti purna karawaaye tathaa putrakameshti yajna ke dauraan yajna vedi se ek alokik yajna purush yaa prajapathy purush utpann hua tathaa dasharath ko swarnapaatr main naivedhy kaa prasad pradaan karke yah kaha ki apni patniyon ko yah prasad khilaa kar vah putr prapti kar sakate hai
 Dasharatha was overjoyed by this and fed his Pattarani Kaushalya half of that prasad
 bache huye bhaag kaa aadha bhaag dasharath ne apni duusari rani sumitra ko diya
 He gave half of his remaining portion to Kaikeyi
 kuch sochakar unhone bachaa hua aathvaan bhaag bhi sumitra ko de diya
 Sumitra did not even eat the first part knowing that she would not eat her share until King Dasaratha gave Kaikeyi his share
 ab kaikeyi ne apana hissaa pehle kha liya or tatpashchaat sumitra ne apana hissaa khaaya
 For this reason Ram, Bharata and Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born
 ram ke sita ke vivaah ke baad dasharath ne yah ghoshnaa kar di ki ram kaa rajbhishek turant hoga
 Kaikeyi had a maid maithra who raised Kaikeyi from childhood and was raised with Kaikeyi as his dowry after his marriage
 vah ek kutil raajnneetijna thi
 He told Kaikeyi that the coronation of Rama would not harm Kaikeyi but only harm
 usne kaikeyi ko raja dasharath se apane do var maangane kii salaah di
 This incident is of the time when Dasaratha was fighting against the Asuras together with the Devas
 asuron ko khadedate samay unka rath yuddh ke keechad main fas gaya
 The charioteer of that chariot was Kaikeyi himself
 usee samay kisi shatru ne yudhastra chalaa kar dasharath ko ghayal kar diya tathaa vah maranasann ho gayi
 Dasaratha's death was certain if Kaikeyi did not take his chariot away from the battlefield and treat him
 dasharath ne hosh main aakar kaikeyi se koi bhi do var maangane kaa aagrah kiya
 At that time the circumstances of the kingdom of Ayodhya were favorable and all were living in a cordial environment, so Kaikeyi refused to ask for that bridesmaid and postponed saying that she would ask for this bridesmaid when the time comes
 ab jabaki dusht manthara ke bahekaave main aakar kaikeyi ko yah abhas ho gaya ki shriram ke rajbhishek ke baad uskaa anhith hi hone vaala he, usne kopbhavan main jane kaa vichaar kar liya
 In that period there was a Kopabhavan in Ranivas where any queen could express her disagreement by being angry due to any reason and it was the duty of the king to go to the court of Kopabhavan and persuade that queen
 raja dasharath ne bhi vaisaa hi kiya
 When Kaikeyi showed his desire to ask for his two brides, Kamoramukta King Dasharatha agreed
 yahan par yah nahin bhoolanaa chaiye ki kaikeyi dasharath kii sabase yuva rani thi or raja dasharath swayan chauthe kaal main pahunch gayi the
 Therefore, it was natural for him to awaken his lust towards Kaikeyi and King Dasaratha was always ready to fulfill whatever he had for that lust
 ab kaikeyi ne raja dasharath se vah do var maange
 From one of his sons Bharat to the throne of Ayodhya and the other to Rama for fourteen years of exile
 raja dasharath yah bardaashat na kar sake
 He tried to convince Kaikeyi a lot
 use bura-bhala bhi kaha
 But when Kaikeyi did not listen to him, he was hurt and fell there in the Kop Bhavan
 ram ko jab is vishay kii abhas hua to vah swayan hi dasharath ke sameep gayi or unase aagrah kiya ki raghukul kii maryaada ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vah kaikeyi ko donon var pradaan kar den
 They stubbornly convinced the king for these things and, wearing the clothes of ascetics, set out towards the forest with Sita and Lakshmana
 dasharath yah sadma bardaasht na kar sake or unhone apane praan tyaag diye
 The name of Dasharatha in the Ramayana comes only after that when Rama addresses himself as Dasharatha-son or introduces himself in this context

 According to George Mollinieux, Edgar's reign was a more important and favorable time for the development of the institutional structure of England than Alfred or Athelstan, which became the basic foundation for the eleventh-century princely rule

 Generally, when the term is used as water below the surface to differentiate from ground water, soil water is also included in it
 haalaanki, yah mrudaa jal se alag hota he jo keval sataha se neeche kuch hi gaharaai main mitti main mauzood jal ko kehete hai
 Groundwater is a natural resource as a source of freshwater
 maanav ke liye jal kii prapti kaa ek pramukh strot bhoojal ke antargat aane vaale jalbhre angreji: Aquifers) hai jinase kuon or nalkupon dwaara pani nikaala jaataa he
 The ground water that has permeated deep into the earth and cannot be extracted by human beings by resorting to the current technology or will cost more financially than utility, is not part of the water resource

 It depicts how water changes from one place to another in its solid, liquid and gaseous forms and how it is transported from one place to another
 bhoojal bhi jalchakr kaa hissaa he or isamen bhi pani ke aagaman or nirgaman ke strot or maarg hote hai
 First, we look at the technical terms associated with certain processes, such as filtration, overflow, etc
 bhoojal punarbharan ek jalavaigyanik prakriya he jiske antargat satahi jal riskar or prithvi ke gurutvkarshan se khinch kar bhoojal kaa hissaa ban jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called groundwater recharge by leakage or filtration
 bhoojal punarbharan ek prakritik prakriya he jise aajkal kritrim rup se sanvardhit karne kii disha main prayaas kiye ja rahe hai kyonki jis teji se manushya bhu jal kaa dohan kar rahaa he keval prakritik prakriya punarbharan main sakasham nahin he
 Generally groundwater is found in fluid form, that is, water form

 In some volcanic areas, the ground water at the bottom is also continuously converted into vapor
 jalbhar dharaatal kii sataha ke neeche chattaanon kaa ek aisa sanstar he jahaan bhoojal ekatrit hota he or manushya dwaara nalkupon se nikaalane yogya anukool dashaon main hota he
 Although water is present in all the rocks below the water level, but it is not necessary that it can be removed for human use

 Water is divided into two types - free water and blocked water
 sanrodhit jalbhar ve hai jinamein upar or neeche donon taraf jalrodhi sanstar paaya jaataa he or inke punarbharan kshetra duusare oonchaai vaale bhaagon main hote hai
 Excreted follicles are also found in these blocked aquifers

 Prominent among them are: bhoojal kaa vaishvik or sthaneey vitaran sarvatra saamaan nahin paaya jaataa
 Generally, the amount of groundwater is found in the areas with rocky ground and igneous rocks
 isaki sarvaadhik maatra jalodh chattaanon or balua jalodh chattaanon main paayi jaati he
 Apart from this, the local climate also has an effect because groundwater recharge depends on the amount and nature of rainfall
 pedo kii maatra or unki jadon kii gaharaai bhi bhoojal punarbharan ko prabhavit karti he
 Some regions in the world are rich in ground water such as the Amazon Basin, Congo Basin, Gangetic Plain and Western Europe

 Concerns are being expressed about the status of waterfowl and groundwater in India
 jis tarah bharat main bhoojal kaa dohan ho rahaa he bhavishya main sthitiyaan kaaphi khatarnaak ho sakati hai
 At present, 29% of the development blocks are either at a pathetic level of ground water or are worrying and according to some statistics, by 2025, about 60% of the blocks will be in a worrisome state
 gyatavya he ki bharat main 60% sinchai etu jal or lagbhag 85% peya jal kaa strot bhoojal hi he, aise main bhoojal kaa teji se girtaa str ek bahut badi chunauti ke rup main ubhar rahaa he

 krishi vistaar ko saamanytah aisi prakriya or pranali ke rup main kiya jaataa he jisamen krishi paddatiyon se sambandhit soochna, gyaan or kaushal unke graahakon ko vibhinn channelon ke madhayam se sampreshit kiye jate hai
 Agriculture extension is generally considered a 'focal point' in the creation and dissemination of knowledge and in imparting education to farmers to become competent decision makers
 krishi vistaar kaa praathmik lakshya krishak pariwaron ko teji se parivartit hoti saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik paristhitiyon ko dhayaan main rakhte hue unke utpaadan or vipanan sambandh ranneetiyon ko unke anukool banane main sahaayta karnaa he taaki ve aage chalakar apni nijeethatha samudaay kii praathamiktaaon ke anusaar apane jivan ko dhaal saken
 In the agricultural sector, knowledge and decision-making ability determine how production factors, ie soil, water and capital can be used
 gyaan kaa srijan karne or uskaa prasar karne, tathaa krushkon ko nirnay lene main sakasham banane ke liye krishi vistaar kendriya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Hence expansion plays an important role in most development projects
 ‘‘vistaar‘‘ shabd kii utpatti 1866 main england main vishvavidhyalay vistaar kii ek pranali ke saath hui jise pehle cambridge or oxford vishvavidhyalayon dwaara aarambh kiya gaya tha or baad main england tathaa anya deshon main anya shaikshanik sansthaaon dwaara apanaaya gaya
 The first use of the term 'extension education' was by the University of Cambridge to spread the educational benefits of universities to the common people
 aise anek visheshgy or vrittik hai jinhone vistaar ko alag-alag rup se paribhaashit kiya he tathaa us par apni raay vyakt kii he jinamein unhone vistaar ke kaaryon ke vibhinn swaroopon ko darshaya he
 Historically, expansion for rural people has meant education in agriculture and home economy
 yah shiksha vyaavhaarik he jiskaa lakshya farm or ghar main sudhaar laana he
 According to Esminger, extension is education and its aim is to change the attitudes and activities of those with whom work is to be done
 ligans ne vistaar shiksha kii pariklpana aise anuprayukt vigyaan ke rup main kii he jisamen anusandhan, sanchit kshetreey anubhaavon se lee gai vishaywastu tathaa vayaskon or yuvaaon ke liye vidhyalay se baahar shiksha kii samasyaon par kendrit haani, siddhanton, vishaywastu or paddatiyon ke ek nikaay main upyogi praudyogiki ke saath sanshlisht vyavhaaraatmak vigyaan se liye gaye praasangik siddhant antarnihit hote hai
 In addition to working in the field, extension is formally taught in colleges and universities resulting in degrees being awarded
 vistaar main shodh bhi kiya jaataa he
 What is unique about the expansion is the use of information about this subject in the socio-economic transformation of the rural community
 is sandarbh main, vistaar ko logon ke jivan kii gunvattta main samposhneey sudhaar laane ke liye unki kshamtaaon ke vistaar ko logon ke jivan kii gunvattta main samposhneey sudhaar laane ke liye unki kshamtaaon ke vistaar ko logon ke jivan kii gunvattta main samposhneey sudhaar laane ke liye unki kshamtaaon ke vistaar ko logon ke jivan kii gunvattta main samposhneey sudhaar laane ke liye unki kshamtaaon ke vikaas ke vigyaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiy vikaas ke vigyaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 The main objective of expansion is human resource development
 vistaar kii avadharana nimnlikhit buniyadi aadhaar-vaakyon par aadhaarit haih- Extension Objectives Extension Objectives The general objectives of expansion are- gyaan main parivartanah kaa arth he us baat main parivartan jo log jaanate hai
 For example, farmers who do not know about the HYV crop get to know about it through participation in extension programs
 vistaar abhikarta jo soochna praudyogiciko nahin jaanate hai, prashikshan paathyakram main bhaag lene ke pashchaat inke vishay main jaan jate hai
 Change in skill: There is a change in the technique of doing the work
 kisaanon ne echvaivi fasal ko ugane kii takanic sikhi, jise ve pehle nahin jaanate the
 EA learned IT skills
 krishi abhivritti abhivritti main parivartan main katipay baton ke prati bhaavana yaa pratikriya parivartan shaamil he
 The farmers developed a favorable attitude towards the HYV crop
 ie ne vistaar kaarykram main iske prayog ke bare main anukool bhaavana viksit kii
 a change in understanding means a change in perception
 kisaanon ne vidyaman fasalon kii kismon kii tulana main apane krishi pranali main echvaivi fasal ke mahatv tathaa usapariman ko mahasoos kiya jis tak yah unke liye aarthik drushti se laabhprad tathaa vaanchhneeya he
 EA understood the use of IT and the extent to which it makes expansion work more effective
 lakshya main parivartan kisi nishchit disha main vah duuri he jise nirdhaarit samyavadhi ke bheetar kisi vyakti ke dwaara tay kiya jaataa he
 This is the extent to which farmers have raised their targets in crop production to 4, ie increasing the crop yield in a typical season by five quintals by harvesting HYV crops
 ie ne soochna praudyogiki kaa prayog karke ek nishchit avadhi ke bheetar kisaanon dwaara apanaai gai sanvardhit prakriya hasil karne kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya
 a change in action means a change in execution or in doing things
 jin kisaanon ne pehle echvaivi fasal nahin ugaai, unhone ab use ugaaya
 eas who did not use them earlier in their expansion programs started using them
 aatmavishvaas main parivartan main aatmanirbharta shaamil he
 Farmers made sure that they had the ability to increase crop yield
 ie ne behatar vistaar kaary karne ke liye apni yogyata main aasthaa viksit kar lee
 Development of self-confidence or self-reliance is the solid foundation for our progress
 vyavhaar main vaanchhneeya parivartan laana vistaar kaa mahatvapurn kaary haih vartan laana vistaar kaa mahatvapurn kaary haih vartan laana vistaar kaa mahatvapurn kaary haih is prayojanarth, vistaar carmik vistaar kaary ko adhik prabhavi banane ke liye nirantar nai jaankaree kii talash karenge
 Farmers and housewives too, through their own initiative, constantly find ways to improve their fields and homes
 yah kaary kathin he kyonki lakhon kisaan parivaar kam shikshit hone ke saath-saath apni-apni aasthaaon, mulyon, abhivrittiyon or baadhaon ke saath vishaal kshetra main faile hue hai tathaa vividh udhyamon main karyrat hai
 Principles are general guidelines, which form the basis of decisions and actions in a consistent way
 vistaar main saarvbhaumik satya prastut kiya jaataa he jise vibhinn vividh sthitiyon or paristhitiyon ke antargat behatar paaya gaya he
 According to Kelsey and Hearne, extension education is the basic philosophy of teaching people how to think and what not to think
 vistaar kaa vishisht kaary prerana dena, vishisht salaah or takneekee sahaayta kii aapurti karnaa tathaa paraamarsh dena he taaki yah dekha ja sake ki apni swayan kii samasyaon ko ‘soochibaddh‘ karne, apane swayan ke margon ko tay karne keliye log kis prakaar vyakti vishesh, pariwaron, samoohon or samudaayon ke rup main ekajute hokar ek ikai ke rup main kaary karte hai or yah ki ve kis prakaar apane uddeshyon kii prapti karte hai
 Steadfast expansion philosophy is always foreshadowing
 yah darshan vistaar kii aavashyaktaaon or staron kaa aadhaar ban jaataa he
 The need for expansion arises from the fact that there is a need to improve the condition of rural people in general and farmers in particular
 kya vidyaman he arthath vaastavik sthiti tathaa kya hona chahie arthath apekshit sthiti, ke bich antar vidyaman he
 This gap has to be reduced through application of science and technology in their enterprises and bringing about appropriate changes in their behavior
 soope ke anusaar, anusandhankarta ke paas graminon ko vaigyanik paddatiyaan apnaane ke liye protsaahit karne tathaa unase gramin samasyaon kaa pataa lagane kaa na to samay hota he or na hi ve iske liye taiyaar hote hai
 Similarly, it is difficult for all farmers to visit research centers and obtain necessary information
 atah ek aisi agency kii aavashyaktaa he jo krishakon ko anusandhan ke nishkarsh samajha ja sake tathaa anusandhan ke liye unki samasyaon ko prastut kar sake taaki unka samaadhaan nikaala ja sake
 This gap is narrowed by the extension agency
 saamanyatya vistaar ke do str maane jate hai, vistaar shiksha or vistaar seva
 At both these levels, expansion is related to each other but at the same time they maintain their separate identities
 vistaar shiksha - vistaar shiksha - vistaar shiksha kii bhoomika saamanytah ucch shikshan sansthaaon dwaara nishpadit kii jaati he jaise krishi or anya vishvavidhyalay or college, isiear santhaan, grih vigyaan college or sheershasth prashikshan or vistaar sanghathan
 At the university level, extension is integrated with teaching and research, while at the research level, extension is integrated with research
 anya sheershasth str ke sanghathanon main, vistaar saamanyatya vistaar main prashikshan ke saath ekikrut he

 banaras gharaana bhartiya tabalaa vaadan ke chah prasiddh gharaanon main se ek he
 This gharana was developed some 200 years ago by the efforts of the famous Pandit Ram Sahai
 pandit ram sahay ne apane pita ke sang paanch varsh kii aayu se hi tabalaa vaadan aarambh kiya tha
 He came to Lucknow at the age of 9 and became a disciple of Modhu Khan of Lucknow Gharana
 jab ram sahay maatr 17 varsh ke hi the, tab lakhanu ke naye nawab ne modhu khan se poocha ki kya ram sahay unke liye ek pradarshan kar sakate hai? kehete hai, ki ram sahay ne 7 raaton tak lagaataar tabalaa-vaadan kiya jisaki prashansa puure samaaj ne kii evam un par bheton kii barsaat ho gayi
 Ram Sahai returned to Benaras after performing his talent
 kuch samay uparaant ram sahay ne paaramparik tabalaa vaadan main kuch badlaav kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii
 For the next six months, they became isolated and the result of this solitude came to the fore, which is today called banaras-baz
 ye banaras gharaane kii vishisht tabalaa vaadan style he
 The main motive behind this new playing style was that it was also suitable for solo playing and could also provide accompaniment for any other musical instrument or dance
 isamen table ko najuk bhi vaadan kar sakate hai, jaisaa ki khyal ke liye chaiye hota he or pakhaawaj kii tarah dhrupad yaa kathak nrity style kii sangat ke liye drut gati se bhi bajaayaa ja saktaa he
 Ram Sahay invented a new way of finger taping in tabla playing, which was especially important for the rhythm of na
 isamen anguli ko modakar daahine main adhiktam anunaad kampan utpann kar sakate hai
 He also made various combinations from the then conjunctive forms such as Gut, Piece, Paran, etc
, among which Uthan, Banarasi contract and Parda are prominent
 aaj banarsi tabalaa gharaana apane shaktishaalee rup ke liye prasiddh he, haalanki banaras gharaane ke vadak halke or komal swaron ke vaadan main bhi sakasham hai
 The gharana is classified in the eastern eagle, which includes Lucknow, Farrukhabad and Banaras gharana
 banaras style table ke adhik anunadik thapon kaa prayog karti he, jaise ki naa or dhin
 Banaras players preferably give thi-thi thap with the whole hand, rather than giving with one finger; As in Delhi style
 vaise banaras baj style main donon hi thap ekikrut kii gai hai
 Tabla players of the Banaras Gharana are well versed in all styles of tabla playing, such as solo, accompaniment, singing and dance accompaniment etc
 banaras gharaane main ekal vaadan bahut iksit hua he or kai vadak jaise pandit sharada sahay, pandit kishan maharaj or pandit samta prasad, ekal tabalaa vaadan main maharath or prasiddhi praapt hai

 The police arrest two people on the charge of committing a theft but there is no evidence against them
 unhen ek duusare se alag karke un donon se police alag-alag kahati he ki - Its summary can be written in a table like this: is khel main, agar yah lage kii doosraa bandi swaarthee he to swayan bhi kudagarz jo janaa chahie or dhokhaa de dena chahie, varanaa khud ko hi 1 varsh kii jail ho sakati he
 But if both the captives start doing this, then both will be imprisoned for 3 months
 is se bhale to vah donon hi chup rahakar the, kyonki tab unhen keval 1 maheene kii jail hoti
 This example shows that even though both have personal benefits according to their selfishness in helping each other, they are forced to co-operate due to lack of trust in each other

 The alluvial plain is further divided into two parts - Khadar and Bangar
 bhabar 8 se 10 kilometre chaudaai kii patali pattee he jo shivalik giripad ke samanaantar faili hui he
 As a result, the rivers flowing out of the Himalayan mountain ranges accumulate heavy water-loads, such as large rocks and shells, and sometimes disappear on their own
 bhabar ke dakshin main tarai kshetra he jisaki chaudaai 10 se 20 kilometre he
 The lost rivers in the Bhabhar region appear on the surface in this region and because they do not have definite vessels, this area becomes Anoop, which is called Terai

 The inter-government panel sitting on climate change concludes that "the increase in the world's average temperature since the middle of the 20th century is primarily due to man-made greenhouse gases
" jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he, dharti ke vaataavaran ke taapmaana main lagaataar ho rahi vishwavyaapee badhotaree ko 'global varming' kaha ja rahaa he
 Our earth receives heat from the sun's rays
 ye kirane vayumandal se guzarati huin dharti kii sataha se takaraati hai or phir vahiin se paravartit hokar pun: laut jaati hai
 The Earth's atmosphere is made up of several gases, including some greenhouse gases
 inamen se adhikansh dharti ke upar ek prakaar se ek prakritik aavaran bana leti hai jo lautati kirnon ke ek hisse ko roak letaa he or is prakaar dharti ke vaataavaran ko garm banaae rakhata he
 It is worth noting that at least 16 degree Celsius temperature is necessary for humans, creatures and plants to survive
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki greenhouse gaison main badhotaree hone par yah aavaran or bhi saghan yaa motaa hota jaataa he
 In such a situation, this cover starts to prevent more rays of the sun and then from here the effects of global warming begin
 ipisisi dwaara diye gayi jalwaayu parivartan ke model ingit karte hai ki dharaatal kaa ausat global taapmaana 21veen shatabdi ke dauraan or adhik bad saktaa he
 This rise in the temperature of the whole world can cause sea level rise, rise in extreme weather and significant changes in the amount and composition of rainfall
 global varming ke anya prabhaavon main krishi upaj main parivartan, vyapaar margon main sanshodhan, glacier kaa peeche hatana, prajatiyon ke vilupt hone kaa khatra aadi shaamil hai
 "global warming" refers to the warming in recent decades and its persistence, and its indirect effects on humans
 jalwaayu parivartan par sanyukt raashtra samjhaute kii ruparekha main "maanav dwaara kiye gaye parivartanon ke liye "jalwaayu parivartan or anya parivartano ke liye "jalwaayu parivartanshiltaa" shabd kaa istemaal kiya he
 The term "climate change" assumes that rising temperatures are not the only effect
 The term "anthropogenic global warming" is used many times when the focus is on human-induced change
 prithvi kii jalwaayu bahari dabaav ke chalate parivartit hoti rahati he jisamen surya ke chaaron ore iske apni kaksha main hone vaale parivartan bhi shaamil hai
 The pressure on the orbit also changes the concentration of solar flashes, volcanic eruptions, and atmospheric greenhouse gases
 vaigyanik aam sahmati hone ke baad bhi haal hi main hui garmi main vruddhi ke vistrut kaaran shodh kaa vishay hote hanyah he ki maanviya gatividhiyon ke kaaran vaataavaran kii greenhouse gaison main vruddhi se hone vaali adhikansh garmi ko audyogic yug kii shuruyaat ke baad se dekha gaya
 This credit goes to the most recent 50 years for which data are available
 aam sahmati ke vichaar se alag kuch anya sankalpanaaon kaa suzav adhikansh taapmaana vruddhi kii vyakhya karne ke liye diya jaataa he
 One such hypothesis proposes that heat can be a result of solar activity in different forms
 baadhyataa kaa koi bhi prabhaav taatkaalik nahin he
 The heat inertia of the Earth's oceans and the slow response to many indirect effects mean the Earth's current temperature is not in equilibrium with the pressure exerted on it
 Studies of climate commitment show that if greenhouse gases are stabilized at 2000 levels So to some extent even beyond this
 garmi dikhaai degi The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fournier and was first quantitatively investigated in 1896 by Scenti Arness
 yah prakriya dwaara jo avasorana or utsarjan ke avarakt vikiran dwaara vaataavaran main garm gaisen vaataavaran main ek or grah kii sataha kam he
 The existence as a greenhouse effect is thus not disputed
 swaabhaavik rup se green house gaison ke paas hone kaa matlab he ek garmi ke prabhaav ke bare main 33 degree celsius, jo prithvi par rahane yogya nahin honge
 
 Important greenhouse gases on the earth are water vapor, which produces 36–70 percent greenhouse effect); carbon dioxide that produces up to 9–26 percent greenhouse effect; methane up to 4-9 percent and ozone, which produces up to 3-7 percent effect
 The issue is how the power of the greenhouse effect changes when atmospheric concentrations of certain greenhouse gases increase from human activity
 audyogic kranti ke baad se maanvi gatividhi main vruddhi hui he jiske kaaran green house gaison ki maatra main bahut jiyaada vruddhi hui he, iske kaaran vikaranshil baadhya CO se2, methane, tropospheric ozon, siefasi or s nitrous bhi bahut bad gaye hai Iagara anu ki drushti se dekhen to methane greenhouse gasccharbon dioxide kii tulana main adhik prabhavi he, par uski sandratha itani kam he ki uskaa vikaranshil jor carbon dioxide ki tulana main keval ek chauthai he praaqatik rup se utpann hone vaali kuch duusari gaise greenhouse prabhaav main yogadan detii hai
 One of these nitrous oxide is developing due to human activities like agriculture! Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 have increased by 31% and 149% respectively since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700th century
 pichley 650,000 varshon ke dauraan kisi bhi samay se in staron ko kaaphi adhik mana ja rahaa he
 This is the period for which the reliable figures are ice cores
 Are derived from
 kam pratyaksh bhuvaigyanik pramaan se yah mana jaataa he ki CO2 kii itani zyada maatra pichhali baar 20 karod varsh pehle hui thi
 Burning of fossil fuels has increased at least one-third of the increase in CO2 from human activities in the last 20 years
 shesh kaary bhoomi ke upyog main parivartan ke kaaran se hota he visheshkar wanon kii kataai se aisa hota he
 Current vaso-atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are approximately 385 per million ppm) by volume
 bhavishya main CO2 kaa str zyada hone ki ashanka he kyunki jeevashm eendhan or bhoomi ke upyog main kaafii parivartan aa rahe hai vruddhi k dar anishchit aarthik, saamaajik, takneekee or prakritik ghatnaon par nirbhar karegi par shaayad aakhirkaar jeevashm eendhan kii uplabdhta hi nirnaayak sabit ho ipisisi kii utsarjan paridrishyon par vishesh report bhavishya ke kai CO2 paridrishyo ke bare main bataati he jo 2100 ke akhir tak 541 se lekar 970 pipiem tak ho sakate hai
 There are sufficient reserves of fossil fuels to reach this level and to continue emissions even after 2100 if coal, sand sand or methane claretrate are widely used
 jalwaayu par baadhk ghatakon ke prabhaav vibhinn prakriyaaon dwaara jatil ho jate hai
 One of the most obvious responses relates to water evaporation
 carbon daai oxide jaisi dirghakaalin greenhouse prabhaav vaali gaison ke milane se paidaa hone vaali garmi vayumandal main jal ke adhik maatra main vashpikaran kaa kaaran banataa he
 Because water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, it makes the atmosphere even hotter and it changes more water vapor into B) and this reaction continues until the recycling cycle is stopped
 Its effect from oxide will be huge
 yadhyapi pratyuttar kii yah prakriya vaayu kii nami ke kanon main badhotari karti he, tab bhi saapeksh ardrata yaa to sthir rahati he yaa thodi si ghat jaati he kyonki vaayu garm ho jaati he
 This effect of response can only be reversed slowly as carbon dioxide has a longer atmospheric lifespan
 badalon se prabhavit hone vaale pratyuttar ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 Seen from below, the cloud emits infrared radiation back to the surface and exerts a heat effect, seen from above, the clouds and sunlight emit space to reflect infrared radiation and therefore exert a cooling effect
 shuddh prabhaav kya garm athwa thanda he yah badal kii kism or unchai jaise vivaranon par nirbhar karata he
 These descriptions on climate models are difficult to demonstrate because clouds are much smaller than the points between spaces on computer mines of climate models
 jaise jaise vayumandal garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise paramarshi pratyuttar kii prakriya chook dar main parivartan se sambandhit hoti he
 As the temperature in the troposphere increases, the temperature of the atmosphere decreases
 avarakt vikiran kaa utsarjan taapmaana kii chauthi shakti par nirbhar karata he, vaataavaran kii upari tah se zyada lambi vikiran utsarjit hoti he or nichali tah se yah kam hoti he
 Most of the radiation that is emitted from the upper atmosphere goes into the hole, while the radiation emitted from the lower atmosphere is again absorbed by the atmosphere
 is prakaar, green house prabhaav vaataavaran main taapmaana ke oonchai ke saath kam hone kii raftaar pe nirbhar karata he, agar taapmaana kii dar kam he to green house asar zyada hoga or agar taapmaana girane kii dar kam he to green house asar kam hoga
 Both the theory and the model indicate that warming will reduce the temperature drop with altitude, creating a negative lapse rate feedback and weakening the greenhouse effect
 oonchai ke saath taapmaana parivartan kii dar kaa maapan choti-choti trutiyon ke prati bahut savendenshil hota he, isse yah pataa karnaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa he ki model hakeekat se mail khaataa he ke nahin 
 Another important process is the ice 'albedo response when the global temperature increases, then the ice near the poles starts melting at a faster rate
 jaise jaise barf pighalati he vaise vaise bhoomi athwa khulaa jal uskaa sthsthaan le letaa he
 Both land and water are less reflective than ice and therefore absorb more amount of solar radiation
 isse adhik garmi ho jaati he jiske kaaran or adhik barf pighalane lagati he tathaa yah chakra chalata rahata he
 Positive reorientation that occurs due to the emission of CO2 and CH4 is another reason that increases warming
 yah gaisen jamate hue permphrost jaise kii jamaa hui lakdi, siberia main daldal se paidaa hoti hai
 Likewise, methane clathrate, which is found in the oceans, emits enormous amounts of CH4, can be a major cause of warming, as the clathrate gun hypothesis states
 jaise jaise samudr garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise carbon ko alag karne kii kshamta ghatati jaati he
 This is because the declining levels of nutrients in the mesopelagic region are impeding the development of diatoms and favor small phytoplankton that are biological pumps of carbon
 pichley 30 varshon se Some papers suggest that the Sun's contribution has been underestimated
 Duke University ke do shodhakartaaon, Bruce West or Nicola Scafetta ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki surya ne 1900-2000 tak shaayad 45-50 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaane main yogadan diya he or 1980 or 2000 ke bich main lagbhag 25-35 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaaya he
 Climate models have been found by Peter Scott and other researchers to overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases and do not give much importance to solar forcing, suggesting that volcanic dust and sulfate aerosols are also underestimated
 Despite solar forcing, much of the warming is likely to be caused by greenhouse gases, especially from the mid-20th century
 ek anumaan yah he ki alag alag alag roopon main saura nirgam, jo kii badalon ke bannane se, jo kii gaalactic brahmadia kirnon dwaara banate hai, ne bhi haal kii varming main hissedari kii he
 It has also been suggested that the magnetic activity in the Sun also triggers cosmic rays which affect the condensation nuclei of clouds and also affect the climate
 surya kii gatividhi kaa ek asar yah bhi hoga kii isse stretosphior garm ho jaayegi, jabaki green house gas siddhant vahaan par shitalan kii bhavishyavaanee karata he
 This trend has been observed since the stratosphere has cooled since the 1960s
 stratosferick ozon kii katautee ke kaaran sheetaltaa bhi paidaa hoti he, par ozon riktikaran 1970 ke dashak ke ant tak nahin hua
 Due to solar variation and volcanic activity, from the industrial age to the 1950s, the heat did not increase but only cooling
 2006 main peter fokal or sanyukt rajya america, germany or switzaraland ke anya shodhakartaaon ne paaya kii surya kii chamak main pichley 1000 saalon se koi parivartan nahin aayaa he
 The solar cycle has increased by only 0
07 percent in the last 30 years
 global varming ke liye yah bahut chota tathaa mahatvapurn yogadan dene vaala prabhaav he
 a research by Mike Loquood and Klaus Frohlich found that since 1985, there is no correlation between global warming and solar radiation, whether it is solar energy or cosmic rays
 Henrik Svensmark or Eigil Friis - Christensen, jo kii badalon ko paidaa karne ke sansthaapak hai, ne apane is anumaan kii aalochana kii he 2007 main ek shodh se paaya gaya kii pichley bees saalon main dharti par aane vaali brahmadia kirnon or badalon or taapmaana main koi sambhandh nahin nahi 
 According to the instrumental temperature record, the temperature of the Earth, whether on land or at sea, has increased from 1860–1900

 Clubs can decide, through their corporate bye-laws, how many members to have and who can be one
 saamanyatya, jabaki yah ek gaiyr-laabhakaari nigam he, ek parsparik laabhakaari nigam ek dani sanstha nahin he
 Because it is not a charity, a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation cannot achieve a 501 rating
 If there is a dispute over the manner of operation in a non-profit corporation for mutual benefit, then its members can settle the dispute, as the corporation is formed only to meet the needs of its members and not the general public

 | From whose west it can be found in the sub-languages of Rajasthani
 haryana main yah dilli ke dakshini ilaakon main boli jaati he- faridabad jila or gudgaanv or mevaat jilon ke purvi bhaag
 It developed mainly in western Uttar Pradesh and adjoining Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 mathura, bharatpur,hindun city, dhaulpur, agra, gwalior aadi ilaakon main aaj bhi yah mukhya samvaad kii bhashaa he
 The Brajbhasha exists either in its original form or with slight changes in this one area
 isiliye is ilaake ke ek bade bhaag ko brijanchal yaa brijbhoomi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The "brajbhasha" developed in the tradition of Indian Aryan languages is born from the womb of Shaurseni Apabhramsa
 jab se gokul vallabh sampradaay kaa centre bana, brajabhasha main krishna vishyak sahitya likhaa jane laga
 With this effect, the dialect of Braj became a literary language
 bhaktikaal ke prasiddh mahakavi mahatma surdaas se lekar aadhunik kaal ke vikhyath kavi shri viyogi hari tak brajabhasha main prabandh kavy tathaa muktak kavy samay samay par rache jate rahe
 Due to the influence of district life, many forms of Braj Bhasha are visible to us
 kintu thode se antar ke saath unamem ekarupata kii spasht jhalak hamen dekhne ko milti he
 Brajbhasha has its own metaphorical nature, that is, its singular masculine nouns and adjectives are often immediate; Nouns such as Khurpou, Yamrau, Manjou, etc
 are out of date

 The common past-present singular masculine form of the verb also remains predominantly in Brajbhasha
 yah baat alag he ki uske kuch kshetron main "y" shruti kaa aagam bhi paaya jaataa he
 In the dialect of Tehsil Kol of District Aligarh, the common past tense form is devoid of "Y" Shruti, but "Y" Shruti is definitely found in the Tehsils of District Mathura and South Bulandshahr
 jaise : "" Carau Chora Bolou "" -
 ""karau chhora bolgau"" -
 "" Carau Landa Bolou "" -
 kannauji kii apni prakruti okarant he
 In the forms of nouns, adjectives and verbs, Kannauji follows Okranta where Brajbhasha moves with inertia
 jila aligarh kii jalapadiya brajabhasha main yadi ham kahen ki- ""karau chhora bolau"" to ise hi kannauji main kahenge ki-""kaaro larika bolo
 The future verb kannauji has a tintarupini, but in the Brajbhasha, it is found to be kridantarupini
 yadi ham "ladkaa jayega" or "ladki jaaegi" vaakyon ko kannauji tathaa brajabhasha main roopantarit karke bolen to nimnaankit rup pradaan karenge : In Kannauji - Lurika Jai hai
 bitiyaa jaihai
 In Brajbhasha - Chhora Jaigou
 chhori jaigi
 It is clear from the above examples that the verb in the common future tense form of Brajbhasha changes according to the gender of the subject, while there is a form in Kannauji
 iske atirikt kannauji main avadhi kii bhanti vivruti kii pravriti bhi pai jaati he jiskaa brajabhasha main abhaav he
 Sandhyrithya is often found in the nouns, pronouns, etc
 of Kannauji, but in Brajbhasha, those terms are found in the rheumatic state
 udhaaharan : Kannauji - "" Bu Go ""
 brajabhasha -""bo gayu"" 
 In the pronouns "bo" and "bo", the pronouns of the above sentences describe the nature of the two languages of Sandhirahitya and Sandhi

 yahan jaadu rajputon kii bastiyaan hai
 Kannauji-influenced Braj Bhasha - District Etah and Tehsils are influenced by Kannauji language of Anupshahar and Atrauli
