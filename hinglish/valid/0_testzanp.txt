 Many malware are used to send unsolicited email and to send and receive confidential and pornographic messages on computers

 Both of them damage and damage the necessary system of the computer
 asal main ye computer ko fries yaa krash kar dete hai
 Both worms and viruses often use the same file

 Since the Second World War, all countries of the British Empire, extended around the world, were granted independence as a Dominion

 Today, there are a total of 16 states in the world outside which identify themselves as a homeland of Queen Elizabeth II
 angrezi bhashaa main british samprabhu ke adheen in rajyon ko aam taur par riyalm ke naam se janaa jaataa he, joki francisi shabd royum se liya gaya he, realm yani ek aisa rajya, kshetra yaa pradesh, jisapar ek raja / rani raaj karti he
 It is necessary to know here that "realm" is not a legal or legal term in the official terminology of the United Kingdom or Commonwealth or any Commonwealth Territory, that is, there is no legal definition of "realm"
 atah aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he kii british samprabhu ke adheen aanevaale in rajyon ko kisi vishesh naam se sambodhit kiya jaae, naahin "realm" shabd, ek rajya ke kisi vishesh darje ko paribhaashit karata he

 vidhik rup se "rajmukut" ko ek ekvyakti santhaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki vidhanpalika, karypalika tathaa nyaaypalika ke sampurna samucch nyaayik avatar he

 The royal family, based on this criteria, included Adhirat, his / her companions, the widow / widower of the former sovereign, the offspring of the eldest son of the prince of Wales, and the siblings or widows of the sons of the former ruler and grandson of his male line

 raajnneetik darshan ke antargat raajnneeti, swatantraaa, nyaay, sampatti, adhikaar, kanoon tathaa satta dwaara kanoon ko lagu karne aadi vishyon se sambandhit prashnon par chintan kiya jaataa he : ye kya hai, unki aavashyaktaa kyon hai, koun si vastu sarkaar ko 'vaid' banaati he, kin adhikaron or swatantraaaon kii raksha karnaa sarkaar kaa kartavya he, vidhi kya he, kisi vaid sarkaar ke prati nagarikon ke kya karttavya hai, kab kisi sarkaar ko ukaad phenkna vaid he aadi
 In ancient times, all systematic thinking was under philosophy, so all the disciplines came in the field of philosophy
 raajnneeti siddhanth ke antargat raajnneeti ke bhinn bhinn pakshon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa hai
 Politics is concerned with public life of human beings
 paramparaagat adhyayan main chintan mulak paddati kii pradhanta thi jisamen sabhi tatwon kaa nirikshan to nahin kiya jaataa hai, parantu tark shakti ke aadhaar par uske saare sambhavit pakshon, paraspar sambandhon prabhaavon or parinaamon par vichaar kiya jaataa hai
 'siddhanta' means a group of logically accumulated and analyzed knowledge
 raajnneeti kaa sarokaar bahut-si chizon se he, jinamein vyaktiyon or samoohon tathaa virgon or rajya ke bich ke sambandh or nyaaypalika, naukarshahi aadi jaisi rajya kii sansthaayen shaamil hai
 David Weld, defining political theory, says- andru haikar kii paribhaasha ke anusaar raajnneetik siddhanth- While giving a broad definition of political theory, Guld and Kolb have stated that 'political theory is a subfield of political science', which includes: ham yah nishkarsh nikaal sakate hai ki buniyadi taur par raajnneetik siddhanth kaa sambandh darshanik tathaa anubhavik donon drushtiyon se rajya kii sanghatana se he
 Attempts are made to clarify, describe and give suggestions regarding the state and political institutions
 nihsandeh, naitik darshanik prayojan kaa adhyayan to usamen antarnihit rahata hi he
 Thinker Weinstein said while filling the ocean in Gagar that political theory is primarily an operation in which questions are asked, answers to those questions are developed and imaginary perspectives are created regarding the public life of human beings
 jo prashn puche jate hai ve kuch is tarah ke hote hai rajya kaa swaroop or prayojan kya he? raajnneetik sanghathan ke saadhyon, lakshyon or paddatiyon ke bare main ham kaise nirnay karen? rajya or vyakti ke bich sambandh kya he or kya hona chahie? itihaas ke puure daur main raajnneetik siddhanth in prashnon ke uttar detaa rahaa he
 It has been considered important because the fate of man depends on what kind of system the rulers and the rulers get and whether the joint action is taken for the common good as a result of that system
 darshan main satya or gyaan kii khoj main kisi bhi vishay par kiye gaye samast chintan kaa samavesh he
 When that search is on political subjects, then we call it political philosophy
 isliye jaruri nahin ki usamen koi siddhanth prastaavit kiya jaae or raajnneetik darshan tathaa raajnneetik siddhanth main yahi antar he
 Thus, political theory is a part of political philosophy, but political philosophy is mostly much broader and does not necessarily include any theory
 is prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki raajnneetik darshan rajya, sarkaar, raajnneeti, swatantraaa, nyaay, sampatti, adhikaron, kanoon or kisi bhi praadhikaran dwaara kanoonee samhita ko lagu karaane aadi se sambandhit prashnon arthath ve kya hai? unki jarurat agar he to kyon he? koun-si baaten kisi sarkaar ko vaid banaati hai, use kin adhikaron or kin swatantraaaon kii raksha kerani chahie or use kyon or koun-sa rup grahan karnaa chahie or kanoon kyon he or kya he or vaid sarkaar ke prati nagarikon ke kartavya yadi hai to kya hai or kab kisi sarkaar ko apdasth kar dena vaid hoga yaa nahin hoga aadi prashnon kaa adhyayan he
 By 'political philosophy' we often refer to a general attitude towards politics or to a specific morality or belief or attitude in relation to it, and not all of it necessarily comes under the entire technical subject of philosophy
 raajnneetik darshan kaa sarokaar aksar samakaleen prashnon se nahin, balki manushya ke raajnneetik jivan ke adhik saarvbhaum prashnon se hota he
 But the political theorist's vision is mainly on contemporary political life and although he is interested in explaining the nature and purpose of the state and similar general questions, he is however interested in political behavior, the actual relationship between the state and the citizens and society
 It is also trying to describe and understand the realities of the role of power
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan karte hue hamen yah mahasoos hota he ki raajnneetik siddhanth kii anupurti hamen raajnneetik darshan ke adhyayan se kerani chahie anyathaa vah banjar or apraasangik prathit hote hai
 Political theories are sometimes seen as synonymous with political thought, but it is important to understand that they do not necessarily mean the same
 raajnneetik chintan ek samanyikrut muhaavara he, jisamen rajya tathaa rajya se sambandhit prashnon par kisi vyakti yaa vyaktiyon ke samooh yaa samudaay ke sabhi chintanon, siddhanton or mulyon kaa samavesh hota he
 When a person - whether he is a professor, journalist, writer, poet, novelist etc
 or of course he is a politician - expresses ideas that have a concern in our lives and the thoughts which are about the state and governance and the questions related to them, then he is really Is contemplating political
 uske vichaaron main siddhanth kaa samavesh ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 There will be no theory contained in those ideas when there is no systematic and rational hypothesis presented to explain the historical and political composition related to political rule of state and governance etc
 is prakaar raajnneetik chintan hameshaa kisi vyakti yaa samooh kaa raajnneeti-vishyak saamaanya vichaar hota he, jabaki raajnneetik siddhanth apane-aap main purna or apane bal-boote khadi aisi vyakhya yaa vichaar athwa siddhanth hota he jisamen prashnon ke uttar dene, itihaas kii vyakhya karne or bhavishya kii sambhavit ghatnaon ke bare main purvanumaan lagane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 Of course, this theory is always the creation of a single thinker 
 barker ne kaha tha ki raajnneetik chintan kisi puure yug kaa antarvarti darshan hota he, lekin raajnneetik siddhanth kisi ek vyakti kaa chintan hota he
 Political science is a broad subject or field of study and political theory is a sub-field of it
 raajnneeti vigyaan main ye tamaam baaten shaamil hai: raajnneetik chintan, raajnneetik siddhanth, raajnneetik darshan, raajnneetik vichaardhaara, sansthagat yaa sanrachanagat dhaancha, tulanaatmak raajnneeti, lok prashasan, antarrashtriya kanoon or sanghathan aadi
 Some thinkers have emphasized the science side of political science
 unka kahana he ki jab raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan ek vigyaan ke rup main vaigyanik paddatiyon se kiya jaataa he tab raajnneetik siddhanth jis had tak raajnneetik darshan kaa hissaa he us had tak vah raajnneeti vigyaan nahin mana ja saktaa, kyonki raajnneeti vigyaan main to amurtt or antahprerana se udbhoot nishkarshon yaa chintanon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he lekin raajnneetik darshan thik inhen ayatharth paddatiyon par bharosa karke chalata he
 Political theory is neither pure thought nor pure philosophy nor pure science
 raajnneetik siddhanth main jin prashnon kaa mahatva rahaa he ve samay ke saath-saath badalte rahe hai
 Classical and early political theories were concerned with the quest for a morally flawless political system and focused on questions about the nature and purpose of the state, the basis for the use of political power, and the problem of political defiance
 aadhunik raashtra rajyon ke udai or aarthik sanrachana main hue parivartanon tathaa audyogic kranti ke falswaroop nai praathamikataayen saamne ain or dhyaan kaa centre vyaktvaad tathaa vyakti kii swatantraaa or samaaj evam rajya ke saath uskaa sambandh ban gaya
 Questions like rights, duties, liberty, equality and property became more important
 dhire-dhire ek avadharana ke saath dusro ke sambandh kii vyakhya jaise swatantraaa or samanta, nyaay or swatantraaa, yaa samanta or sampatti ke bich ke sambandh kii vyakhya : bhi mahatvapurn ho gai
 After World War II, a new type of empirical political theory emerged
 isamen manushya ke raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karne or uske aadhaar par saidhantik nishkarsh nikaalane kii koshish kii gai
 Scholars studying human behavior posed new questions for study
 ve bahudhaa vidha kii anya shakhaon se aise prashn udhaar lete the
 Some of these questions are as follows: vigat kuch dashakon se kai or bhi masale ubhare hai - jaise pahchaan, ling, paryaavarnavaad, paristhitiki, samudaay aadi
 At the same time, the value-based political theory has also been revived, in which the questions of freedom, equality and justice have been emphasized in a new way

 As a result, political theory becomes important for paving the way for the unity and integrity of human societies or the collective needs of society, as it tries to study problems and find solutions in that process

 In addition, political theory also tries to establish moral standards and suggest alternative political management and behavior to test the moral quality of the political state
 sankshep main kahen to raajnneetik siddhanth kii praasangikta nimnlikhit baton main nihit haih It should also be remembered that at least in the present period the state is facing greater challenges of poverty, corruption, mass democracy and ethnic and racial tensions, environmental pollution etc

 Political theory tries to study the present and future problems of the political life of society and suggest solutions to those problems
 david heldne kaha he ki raajnneetik siddhanth kaa kaary apni jatiltaaon ke kaaran bahut guru-gambhir he, kyonki vyavasthit adhyayan ke abhaav main is baat kaa khatra rahata he ki raajnneeti agyaan or swaarthee logon ke haathon main apni shakti kii bhukh mitaane kaa saadhan banakar na rah jaae
 Thus, if we have to systematically consider the nature and purpose of the state and the problems of governance, keeping in mind the social reality and ideals and political philosophy, then we have to adopt the path of theoretical study of the problem
 is prakaar raajnneetik siddhanth praasangik he
 At the same time, studying political theory on a personal level gives us information about our rights and duties and helps in understanding social realities and problems like poverty, violence, corruption etc
 raajnneetik siddhanth isliye bhi mahatvapurn hai ki vibhinn raajnneetik siddhanton ko aadhaar bana kar ‘aage badhate hue vah hamen samaaj ko badalane ke upaay or dishaaen suza saktaa he, taaki adarsh samaaj sthapit kiya ja sake
 The Marxist theory is an example of a theory that not only suggests direction but goes to the extent of advocating revolution to establish an egalitarian society

 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2128 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 alternetr prayavarti dhara utpann karne vaala vidyut janitr he
 In fact it is a synchronous machine
 vartmaan samay main adhikansh shakti sanyantron main vidyut utpaadan kaa kaary alternetr hi karte hai
 Over time, very large size alternators begin to form
 50,000 se 1,50,000 kilowat kii kshamtawale janitr ab saamaanya ho gaye hai
 These are continuous actuation machines, so they are also structured on a very standard basis
 mukhyat:, yah swat: kaaryakari mashin hoti he or iske saare pravartan duurastha niyantran dwaara niyantrit kiye ja sakate hai
 Voltage control can be done easily by varying the field current
 bhaar ke anuroop nivesh swayan hi niyantrit ho jaataa he
 For all these reasons, current power generators are very efficient and reliable
 vastav main inke vishwasaneey pravartan ke kaaran hi vidyut sambharan ko vishwasaneey banaaya janaa sambhav ho sakaa he
 As the use of electricity increased, the size and voltage of the generators also increased
 parantu dishtdhaara janitron main, armechar ghoomanevaala hone ke kaaran uske aakaar main bahut vruddhi karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 Hence high voltage generating alternating current generators were made, in which the armature was voluntary and the field rotating
 vastut:, voltata janan ke liye yah aavashyak nahin ki chaalak hi chumbakeey kshetra main ghume
 Voltage will also be induced in the conductor located in a rotating magnetic field, because even in this case, it is cutting the magnetic current
 at: is siddhant par, sthitik armechar or paribhraman kshetra dwaara voltata janit ho sakati he
 This voltage will be of alternating type and will depend on the relative position of the armature conductor and the field
 prayavarti dhara janitr, saamanyat:, sthitik armechar or paribhramanshil kshetra ke siddhant par aadhaarit hote hai
 In these, field magnets and coils are made revolving and the armature surrounds them
 armechar main kate khaanchon main chaalak sthit hote hai
 Due to the armature being static and outward, its size can be greatly increased, which means, it can have a much higher driver number
 kshetra vinding saapekshatya chote hote hai or unhen adhik veg par ghumaya janaa, vyaavhaarik rup main, koi kathinaayee nahin utpann karata
 Due to these reasons it is possible to generate high voltages in alternating current generators and they are usually applied at 11,000 volts
 in janitron main burushon ke sthaan par sarpi valay hote hai, jo kshetra kundaliyon ko uttejit karne ke liye dhara pahunchaate hai
 They are required to be stimulated by direct current due to the area being revolving
 uttejan dhara yaa to bahari strot se praapt kii jaati he, athwa usee shaft par aropit ek chote se disht dhara janitr se, jise uttejk kehete hai
 The excitation voltage is usually 110 or 220 volts
 sabhi bade janitron main uttejk dwaara sambharan hota he, jisase uttejk ke liye alag se disht dhara strot kii aavashyaktaa na rahe
 Reverse current generators have to act at a fixed velocity, which depends on the frequency of voltage generated in them and the number of field poles
 ise nimnlikhit sameekaran se vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : Here n = revolutions per minute, f = frequency and p = pole number
 is prakaar, 50 chakree aavriti ke liye chaar dhruvi mashin 1,500 parikraman prati minute ke veg se pravartan karegi or do dhruvi mashin 3,000 parikraman prati minute ke veg se
 If the fixed velocity remains the same, then there will be a difference in frequency
 saamanyat: vidyut sambharan nirdhaarit voltata or aavriti ke hote hai
 Therefore, to keep the frequency constant, it is necessary not to keep the velocity of the generator together and this velocity is fixed according to its pole number
 bharat tathaa duusare kaamanwealth deshon main vidyutsambharan kii aavriti saamanyat: 50 chakra prati second nishchit he
 60 cyclic frequency is used in USA and other countries
 aavriti ke anusaar vibhinn dhruvon ke janitron kaa veg bhi nishchit hota he, jise samakramik veg kehete hai
 Based on the above, these generators by velocity have two main types: one is a turbogenerator that is driven by a steam turbine and is driven at high velocity, and the other is a hydroelectric generator, which is usually fired at a low velocity
 kuch kaa veg to 125 parikraman prati minute tak hota he
 They have 48 poles for 50 cyclic frequency
 tervojanitr main dhruv sankhya 2 yaa 4 se adhik nahin hoti
 Larger generators have only 2 poles and operate at 3,000 revolutions per minute
 is antar ke saath saath inaki rachana main bhi bahut antar hota he
 The rotor of a more polarized machine is much larger
 uski rachana ek gatipalak chakra ke samaan hoti he, jo madhya bhaag se cycle ke pahiai kii bhanti spokon par aropit hota he or dhruv golai main chaaron ore lage hote hai
 It is called rotor with salient pole
 iske vipareet, terbo janitr kaa roter bahut lanbaa or belanaakaar hota he
 The poles are not protruding, but the area in the grooves made of cylindrical rotor is formed by the coil
 akruti ke anuroop is prakaar ke roter ko belanaakaar roter athwa chikna roter kehete hai
 Due to the turbogenerator being propelled at high velocity, problems of lubrication and ventilation of the bearings are extremely important
 jalavidyut janitron main vering par bahut adhik bhaar hone ke kaaran tathaa parshv bal ke lagane ke kaaran, snehan kii samasya jatil hoti he, parantu sanvathan swayan apane aap hi paryaapt ho jaataa he
 The oil pump for lubrication is sent with oil pressure to the movable parts, where lubrication is necessary
 tel saaf karne ke liye tel filter bhi aavashyak sahaayak he
 There is also a system of actively shutting down the machine when lubrication pressure decreases
 terbojanitron main sanvathan ke liye bahudhaa valit sanvathan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The ducts in the armature and rotor are made in such a way that air is drawn into these vessels by pulling air from one side and leaving the other side frosting the machine
 ucch veg par is kriya main sahaayta to milti he, parantu bade bade janitron main yah prakritik rup se sanvathan paryaapt nahin hota or hawa ko dabaav ke dwaara mashin main bheja jaataa he
 To protect the machine from dust and moisture, a closed convection system is used
 isamen usee vaayu ko baar baar prayukt kiya jaataa he or garam hone par, vayushitak dwaara use thanda kar liya jaataa he or phir use dabaav ke saath mashin main sanvathan ke liye bheja jaataa he
 In large generators, hydrogen gas is also used instead of air for ventilation
 hydrogen vaayu se 14 guna halkaa hota he
 Therefore, using it for ventilation reduces aerial loss
 ooshmaa nishkasana kaa bhi yah vaayu se adhik prabhavi madhyam he
 But hydrogen combined with air can be explosive and adequate care is taken to protect it
 aato phon botlink germany ke bharatvid tathaa sanskrit ke prakand pandit the jinhone sanskrit sahitya kaa vidhipurvak adhyayan karke, varshon ke parishram ke pashchaat 'sanskrit varterbukh' naamak ek vishaal shabdkosh saat bhaagon main prakashit kiya
 It is a unique book even today
 bottlink kaa janm 30 may 1815 ko rus ke leningrad nagar main hua tha
 He received his higher education in Berlin and Bonn
 bon us samay europe main sanskrit kaa bada centre tha
 His mentor was also a Sanskrit scholar named Francis Bop in Berlin
 vidwaanon ke saath sansarg tathaa vaataavaran ke prabhaav ne inke adhyayan ko nayaa mode diya
 Although his subjects in the university were Arabic and Persian from the beginning, he leaned towards Sanskrit and later he got world fame with this subject
 1840 main inhone 'gramer sanskrit' naamak granth likhaa jo panini kii 'ashtaadhi' par aadhaarit tha
 In 1843, with the same subject, his detailed treatise 'panini Grammatic' was published, in which the formulas have been commented in simple German language
 inkaa ek granth francisi main 'dizarteshiyaan sar laa accent sanskrit' naam se prakashit hua or phir german main kalidas ke shaakuntal kaa anuwaad mul sahit niklaa
 In 1811 a book entitled 'christromathe Sanskrit' was published
 inkaa 'sanskrit varterbukh' 1852 se 75 tak ke kathin parishram kaa prayaas he
 Roth and Weber shared their hand in it
 is granth main prayek shabd kii purna rup se vyakhya kii gai he tathaa sampurna sanskrit sahitya main jahaan bhi uskaa ullekh he, ankit kar diya gaya he
 This allows them to be easily found in the original texts
 san 1904 main germany ke lipazig nagar main is vidvan kaa dehant ho gaya
 To prevent the movement of speed and acceleration, the device that is attached to the main device is called resistor or brake
 yantravidya main prakritik shaktiyon ko niojit kar, icchit prakaar kii gati or twaran praapt kar, usase upyogi kaam lene se bhi adhik mahatv kaa kaam icchit samay par uchit prakaar se unki gati or twaran kaa avrodh karnaa he
 In terms of doing the right thing and also in terms of safety as per state rules, it is necessary to have brakes with each moving device
 avarohak yantra ko kriyasheel karne ke liye bhi kai prakaar kii yantric or prakritik shaktiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or in upayantron main anek prakaar kii yantric prayuktiyaan bhi kaam main laai jaati hai
 Due to these differences, the brakes are classified into the following three categories: patta brake : isamen ek lacheela patta, brake dhol par lapet kar kasne se gharshan ke kaaran gatyavrodh hota he
 Gutka brake: In this, the circular-shaped blocks are hung with the help of levers, they are brought in contact with the circumference of the wheel or drum
 aksheeya brake : jo brake pahie athwa dhol par lagane ke badale mukhya dhure athwa uske samaantar rahanevaale angon par lagaae jate hai, unhen aksheeya brake kehete hai
 Other names for these are heavy brakes, safety, automatic and mechanical brakes
 inaki rachana is prakaar kii hoti he jisase gatyavarodhak bal, dhure par padanevaale balaghurna ke anupaat se hota he, jaisaa bijli or haath se chalaae janevaale crenon main
 When the driving force of the power, or the force of the hand, suddenly becomes weak, the burden hanging from this type of brake stops there itself
 isi kaaran is brake ko swachal kehete hai, lekin yah us prakaar kaa swachal brake nahin he jaisaa railgadiyon main swat: hi lag jaataa he
 In almost all types of brakes, abrasion is caused by drums, wheels, or axles, etc
, but in engines and devices driven by the power of cylinders and pistons, if the other side of the piston is also the working medium, such as vapor, or compressed Even when air, or gas, is delivered, the speed of that device is blocked
 aisa brake gharshanhin brake kehalaata he
 Dynamic brakes are also counted in this category, for example if the electric motor that speeds the device is converted into a dynamo for a few moments, the speed of the powered device is blocked
 inkaa upyog crenon or anya prakaar ke yantron ko chalaanevaale bijli ke motaron kii raftaar ko band karne tathaa rokane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It is mainly of two types: inamen gharshan utpann karanevaale bhaagon par niyantran vidyucchumbakon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Finally, these brakes also work by mechanical action
 ye bhi banaavat ke anusaar teen prakaar ke hote hai, yatha gutkeyukt, pattayukt or chakali yukt
 The drum drums move in any direction, with great stability by the gutka
 pattayukt brikon main gutkeyukt brikon kii apeksha shakti kam lagaani padati he, lekin iske dwaara ek hi disha main gatyavrodh hota he or duusari disha main kamjor pad jaataa he
 In a braided brake, friction knobs are rubbed with axles, which are suppressed by the force of the seams, but have to use the magnetic force of the solenoid to release them
 yah brake donon dishaao main ghoomte samay apana prabhaav daalata he or adhik vishwasaneey bhi he
 In normal use in leased brakes, only the weight of the magnet works and the magnet is pulled to release them
 khulne or band honevaale pulon ko uthaane or waapas baitaane ke liye yadi is prakaar ke brake kaa upyog kiya jaay, to pul kii sthiti badalane ke kaaran sampurna brake yantra hi tedha tirachha ho jaataa he
 In such a condition, only the weight of the magnet is unable to provide the power to hold the brakes
 at: iske saath kamanion kaa bhi upyog karnaa padataa he
 Magnets and its coils for brakes: Where direct current is used, there is a solenoid type in circular brakes, and a fixed-magnet magnet in banded and blunted brakes, but all types where there is a secondary current
 Solenoid magnets are often used in brakes
 lekin us parinalika kaa kor paratyukt bananaa hota he
 The coil current magnet can be placed in the range, or sideways, depending on the design of the controlling device
 praaia: ek hi niyantrak yantra dwaara motor or brake, donon hi ko shakti di jaati he
 Therefore, it is arranged that as soon as the driving motor is stopped powering, the brakes are automatically charged by the brakes and when the motor is revived, the brakes are automatically discharged
 aisi yojana main kundaliyaan shrenee main lagaai jaati hai
 Where alternating current is used, magnetic coils are always fitted according to the lateral current method
 parinalika brake kii kshamta sadaiv boj ko thaamne or gati mandan main prayukt honevaale balaghurna ke rup main vyakt kii jaati he
 This is taken as a fraction of the amount of force in the driving motor to carry full load while calculating, the formula is as follows: anubhav se dekha gaya he ki gatimandan ke liye, sampurna bhaarvahee balaghurna kaa yah 20 se 200% tak hota he
 Where the entire load in the crane etc
 has to be stopped in the middle, the force is to be applied from 100% to 200%
 chhapekhane ke yantron main jahaan kaagaj ke fat jane kaa dar rahata he 20 se 25% tak hi bal lagaaya jaataa he or yatayaat vaahanon main 50% tak lagaaya jaataa he
 When a side-coiled motor of a direction is stimulated, at the same time if it is driven by some other driving medium, such as the momentum of the armature or the momentum of other devices related to it, then that motor starts working as dynamo
 , Because at that time the power of the motor is unconnected to the main power source and becomes related to the controller, so that it can also inhibit the speed of the motor
 Mitigation think the way Dynamo inhibits the speed of your driver engine
 prayavartt dhara ke motaron se jab is prakaar kaa kaam liya jaataa he, tab uske taron kaa sambandh prayavartt dynamau ke samaan hi kar diya jaataa he
 Often the inductor motor is stimulated with a low voltage direction and attaches the rotor to the current controller
 aisa karne se motor kii chaal kaa niyantran dhara niyantrak main honevaale pratirodh kii maatra se thik vaise hi ho jaataa he jaisaa dishtdhaara ke prayog main hota he
 The mechanical energy exploited when the brakes of the dynamic regenerative system are returned to the stationary voltaic system instead of being destroyed in the current controller
 is pranali main disht athwa prayavartt, kisi bhi prakaar kii dhara kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Many brake systems have a mixed use of both dynamic and regenerative systems
 motargadiyon main pair se dabaakar laae janevaale vishuddh yantric brake or dravchaalit brake, donon hi prakaar ke, brikon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It has a double cylinder instead of a cam with two pistons on either side to press the levers on the circumference of the drum
 drav daab utpaadan or pareshan karanevaala pradhan silinder ingine ke paas laga hota he, jinamein andi kaa tel or ether aadi kaa mishran puraa-puraa bharaa rahata he
 a small piston in the cylinders of the above drum is pressurized into the cylinders by the large, strong and flexible tubes, but this fluid being incompressible transmits the pressure to the cylinders in the drum, driving its pistons and friction between the levers and the circumference
 Detracts from pair ke saadhaaran dabaav se silinderon main 100 pound prati varg inch tak daab utpann hoti he or aavashyaktaa ke samay adhik jor se dabaane par 350 pound prati varg inch tak ho jaati he
 In tram trains, three types of brakes are applied by hand, compressed air and electrified
 injanon or prayek vaahan main jo brake lagaae jate hai ve sampidit vaashp, hawa, athwa nirvaat yaa hastshakti chaalit hua karte hai
 Due to compressed air and vacuum, the brakes are auto-driven, which automatically stop the train sections in all vehicles when the train's wafer connectors break or become unrelated, when the train splits
 prayek ingine or alahanda vaiganon tathaa vishesh prakaar ke sawari dibbon main haath brake to avashya hi hota he, jisase ingine kii shakti ke abhaav main, yard main unhen icchit sthaan par roak diya jaay or dhaal athwa vaayu ke jhokon ke kaaran ludhakkar ve chal na pade
 The engines and the accompanying coal and water tanks also have a handheld evaporative brake, whose brakes go into the cylinder and pressurize its piston
 isse liveron kii sahaayta se brake gutke chakkon ko pakad lete hai
 It works in the entire train including the engine
 yadi railgadee ko chalaane ke liye vaashp ingine ho, to uske boyler ke vaashp se or bijli ke ingine main motor dwaara, ek vayusampidak pump chalaaya jaataa he, jisamen ingine par lagi ek badi mukhya tank main 90 se 100 pound prati varg inch kii daab se hawa bhar di jaati he
 a small auxiliary tank is also installed in the vehicles running behind the engine, which has a space of about 12 to 15 cubic feet
 ingine railgadee main jut jane par ingine kii mukhya tank main se dabi hawa ko train pipe main chhod diya jaataa he, jo pipe kii shakhaon main se hoti hui sahaayak tank main bhar jaati he, lekin gaadi main lage brake silinderon main yah hawa keval usee samay pahunchati he jab brake lagaana aavashyak hota he
 The engine has a fill valve located close to the driver's brake controller valve, through which the air pressure of about 70 pounds per square inch is maintained in all its tanks, etc
, when the vehicle is running
 tab driver apni ichha se brake lagaana chahta he, athwa koi bigaad hone ke kaaran jab swat: hi brake lagane lagate hai, us samay train pipe kii hawa kisi na kisi maarg se, chaahe vah driver athwa guard kaa brake valve ho athwa koi anya maarg ho, vayumandal main nikalne lagati he, jisase train pipe kii hawa kii daab ghatate hi sab gadiyon main lage tripal vaalvon ke piston sarak jate hai
 This allows the pressurized air in the tanks of each vehicle to go into the brake cylinders and shrug them with the strength of their pistons, which allows the brake blocks to catch the wheels through the levers
 brikon ko chhudaane ke liye ingine kii mukhya tank main se dabi hawa phir se train pipe main bhar di jaati he, jisase usamen dabaav bad jane se tripal vaalvon ke piston apane puraane sthanon par laut aate hai
 This opens the way of air trapped in the brake cylinders to the atmosphere through triple valves and the brakes are missed
 nirvaat brake jin gadiyon main laga hota he unke prayek vaahan main ek silinder laga hota he, jisamen ek sarakta hua pola piston use do vayurodhi bhaagon main baant detaa he
 At the time when the vehicles stand idle, the piston in the cylinder is filled with ordinary air on both sides and the piston is sitting downward from its load
 gadiyon ko ingine main jot dene par, train pipon ke madhyam se un sab silinderon ko ingine main lage vayuniskaasak yantra se sambandhit kar dete hai or boyler kii vaashp kii drutgamini dhara kii sahaayta se vah yantra samgr gadiyon ke train pipe or usase sambandhit silinderon kii hawa ko chushan kriya dwaara baahar phenkakar, unamem 22 inch tak nirvathan kar detaa he
 Due to both the piston being vacuumed and even at the time of vacuum, it remains below its burden as before
 jab brake lagaana hota he, us samay driver apane valve, athwa guard apane valve, ke dwaara; athwa yatri log zanjeer khinchakar; ek chote valve dwaara train pipe main hawa ko pravisht karvaa dete hai
 With this, it reaches the underside of the pistons in the brake cylinders through the pipe branches
 uske upar kii ore jane ke raste main ek golinuma valve laga rahata he, jo hawa ke dabaav se band ho jaataa he or hawa upar na ja saconeke kaaran piston upar nirvaat bana rahata he
 Hence the air from the bottom lifts it up, allowing the pistons to catch the brakes of the brakes corresponding to the lashing
 brake ko chhudaane ke liye phir se nirvaat karne par, jab piston ke neeche ai hui hawa nikal jaati he, tab piston ke donon ore ek si daab hone ke kaaran apane bojhe se vah neeche baith jaataa he or brake chhot jate hai
