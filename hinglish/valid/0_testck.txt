 In an effort to keep cricket away from government interference, the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday asked its member countries' boards to refrain from including politicians in the executive
 isisi ne kaha ki uske kaaryakari board ne apni baithak main faisla kiya he ki cricket kii behatari ke liye sabhi cricket bordo ko swatantra chunaav karaane or raajnneetik hastkshep se dur rahete hue swatantra tareeke se kaam karnaa hoga
 The executive has made it clear that if the ICC finds that a national board has administrative interference with the government, it can suspend that board
 isisi ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari haaron logart ne kaha ki yah pechida maamla he or yahi kaaran he ki isisi ne sabhi bordo ko apni vyavastha sudhaarney ke liye 12 maheene kaa samay diya he
 Was Raghuram Rajan trying to become an Indian middle class banker? Were they engaged in an attempt to formulate a monetary policy that suits the needs of the majority middle class? Has the populist and sensitive-looking government actually become more liberal towards borrowers or had Rajan become more democratic? Was Rajan trying to become the spokesperson for millions of bank depositors and consumers rather than a handful of borrowers? Was Rajan's ruthlessness towards big bank borrowers and bankers protecting him making him a central banker who was not suited to industry-leader alliances in India? Till now we have never had a debate on monetary policy to mean majority
 hamaari charchaaen karj kii aapurti or byaaj daron main kami-beshi se baahar kabhi nahin nikalatin, jo simit logon kii chintaa he
 After looking at the impact of Indian banking and monetary policy in a wide range, one realizes that perhaps Rajan was turning this policy towards those who do not take loans but are badly affected by monetary policy
 rajan ke purvavarti governor subba raav is baat par achraj main the ki unke bal to kam ho rahe hai lekin bal kataane kii laagat badhati jaati he
 Rajan tried to catch the confusion of inflation, which is the biggest problem of the average Indian middle class
 mahangaai niyantran kisi bhi kendriya bank kaa pehla kartavya he
 For this purpose, the flow of money is controlled through the reduction of interest rates so that more money does not run behind the lesser things in the market and prices are kept under control
 rajan se pehle tak byaaj daren tay karne ke liye thok mahangaai ko aadhaar banaaya jaataa tha or jidipi growth kii jarurat ko lakshya kiya jaataa tha
 This formula did not stop the inflation that cuts our pockets
 rajan ne byaaj daren tay karne ke formule ko khudara mahangaai se jod diya, jo zyada paardarshee or sthaayee tha
 This was also accepted by the financial market
 formula badalane ke saath rigerv bank ne sarkaar ko baadhya kiya ki byaaj daron main kami ke liye upabhokta mahangaai ko kam kiya jaae
 The government is the biggest beneficiary of low interest rates on loans, which takes the maximum loan from banks
 yah niti sarkaar ko phaltu ke kharch ghataakar karj kaarykram (rajkoshiya ghate) ko simit rakhane par bhi baadhya karti thi jo bazaar main karj kii maang ko prabhavit karata he
 Data for the last three years shows that consumer inflation also decreased and the government controlled the deficit
 rajan ne apane ek bhaashan main mahangaai or byaaj daron ke rishte ko samajhane ke liye dose kaa udhaaharan diya tha
 This means that if inflation keeps rising and interest rates are reduced, the ability of pensioners and depositors to buy both becomes limited
 yah udhaaharan unhen pehla aisa kendriya banker banaata he jo banking dhaanche main jamakartaon ke hiton ko karj lene waalon ke baraabar tarjeeh de rahe the
 It is evident that the number of people holding deposits in the bank is much larger than those taking loans
 jamaa hi banking kaa aadhaar he
 Rajan was supportive of giving positive returns (dearness-cum-interest rate) to depositors
 unhone sujhaayaa tha ki sarkaar ko apane ek saal ke karjon par mahangaai dar se do fisadi zyada byaaj dena chahie taaki jamaa par byaaj daren tarksangat rahen
 It is not the opinion of the Finance Ministry, which reduced interest rates on small savings this March
 ullekhneey he ki rajan ke governor banane ke kuch maah baad janvari 2014 se jamaa par real turm ritern sakaaratmak ho gaye the
 Even if we do not think of loans and interest in the case of banks, there is a difference in the reality of banking in India
 yahaan 45 fisadi vayask aabaadi ke paas bank khate nahin hai yani ki vah banking ke daayre se baahar hai
 6 only
 4 fisadi vayask aise hai jinhone kisi vittiya santhaan se karj liya he
 (world Bank Global findex Database 2014) There is also a very limited number of consumer borrowers and the size of their loans
 darasal, bharat main karj kaa vaastavik sansar bade udyogon kaa he
 a quarterly percentage cut in interest rates reduces the monthly installment of a few hundred rupees for the general consumer, but for the largest customers of debt, ie industries and government, this reduction is in crores of rupees
 kaa maamla he
 The Reserve Bank data confirms that as of 31 March last year, only 30 borrowers accounted for one-third of the total loans of public sector banks
 paanch pramukh sarkari bainkon ke kareeb 4
 87 lakh crores
 ke karj sirf 44 karjadaaron ke khate main darj hai or yah sabhi ausat 5,000 karod ru
 Are debtors above
 is karj kii vasuuli ke bina bainkon kii laagat ghatana or karj sasta hona naammumkin he
 It is not difficult to understand that the campaign led by Rajan under the leadership of the Reserve Bank to recover the big borrowers and clean the banks must be troubling
 rajan ke virdohi unhen america se prabhavit bataate hai lekin america main upbhog ke liye bhi karj liya jaataa he, vahaan mahangaai koi mudda nahin he or vahaan sasta karj hi sab kuch he
 India's banking depositors, in contrast, are those for whom returns on bank balance and inflation are the biggest concerns
 rajan kii maudrik koshishon ko bharat ke banking paridrishy ke sandarbh main dekhne ke baad yah sawaal peechha nahin chodta ki kya raghuram rajan madhya varg ke hiton ko maudrik niti kaa sthaayee kaarak bananaa chaahate the jabaki unhen hataane kii muhim chhedgaye vaale kuch or hi chaah rahe the?dhyaan rahe ki centre sarkaar maudrik niti ko tay karne ke nae paimaane jari karne vaali he
 If he were in favor of borrowers more than depositors, then many of our doubts may be proved right

 National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval has been retained by the Modi government once again for 5 years
 itnaa hi nahin unka pramotion kar unhen cabinet mantri kaa darja diya gaya he
 Now the rebel and former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha have raised questions on this appointment
 unhone twit kar likhaa he ki ajit dobhaal pehle hi 74 kii umr paar kar chuke hai, aise main phir bhi unhen cabinet rank kaa darja diya gaya he
 Yashwant Sinha tweeted on Tuesday morning that Ajit Doval has turned 74 years old
 phil unhen paanch saal ke liye rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar bana diya gaya he itnaa hi nahin ab unhen cabinet mantri kaa darja bhi diya gaya he
 Probably, the rule that applies to mps and ministers does not apply to cabinet rank
 Ajit Doval is already 74, yet he has been appointed NSA for five years with cabinet rank
 What applies to mps and ministers obviously does not apply to ministerial rank

 He said the hotel was not closed that day, open
 taj land se jane ke baad or royal china pahunchane se pehle plan main kuch change hua tha jo ki shina ne bataaya tha
 Perhaps she landed on Amar Sons at 9:30
 papa, kuch aisa ho rahaa he jo sahi nahin he
 peter-indrani had said that we had gone to Royal China but it was closed and if you want to go and check then you can say that those people went there or not
 rahul-royal china main booking hoti he or un logon ne bataaya ki shina, indrani, peter yaa phir kisi bhi bora naam ke shaks kii us din koi booking nahin thi
 Yes, but it was open that day
 indrani-koi kanphyus naa ho, main puri baat bataati hum
 Sheena came to Amar Sons at 6:30 pm, we also bought a sari from there
 usne 6-7 saadiyaan dekhi thi
 She bought a saree with a blouse piece
 uske baad ham jeweler kii dukaan par gaye
 After that we went from Taj Land to Royal China
 shina ne mujhase kaha ki 9:15 tak use amar sans waapas janaa he
 So we started walking from there
 maine kaha ki agar hamaare paas samay bachegaa to kuch kha bhi lenge kyonki ham donon ko bhukh lagi hui thi or royal china band tha
 i also called in Royal China but no one answered
 jaahir si baat he vah band tha tabhi kisi ne phone nahin uthaaya
 After this we went to Taj Lands
 jab ham vahaan se nikle tab shaayad 9:15 ho rahe the
 i am not completely sure but i was back home by 9:45
 amar sans se lekar jitna bhi samay laga, main waapas aa gai thi
 At that time, one of my guests in the house was Mikhail, he is a very good friend of ours
 vah ghar ke baahar isiilie intjaar kar rahaa tha kyonki ham log baahar the
 i brought him home and he was there overnight
 yahi puri kahani he royal china kii

 She met me at 6:30
 chalo 07:15 maan lete hai
 
 
 Now ask them how long it is open
 bas unhen phone karo or pucho ki unke shater kab khulte hai
 If they say we open at 6 then it is a different thing
 or agar yah 7:30 yaa 8 baje khulata he, to tumhe pataa chal jayega ki main jo bhi kah rahi hum vah sach he
 So will you call them for me? Rahul - Yes, absolutely Indrani - just check once

 Rahul - yes Indrani - you can call Taj and ask
 rahul-indrani, suno is tarah kii ulti-sidhi baaten naa bataao
 i am trying to find something out
 indrani-rahul, agar tum yah kehane kii koshish kar rahe ho ki main iske bare main jaanati hum
 i don't know anything about Sheena's disappearance
 tumhen mujh par vishwaas karnaa hoga jo kuch bhi main kah rahi hum
 You have a choice not to believe or believe in me
 main keval vahi bataa sakati hum jo sach he, vah nahin jo tum sunanaa chaahate ho
 Okay
 
 
 main tumhen ghatnaon kaa sahi sikvence de rahi hum
 Ok i got a message from him

 tumhen do chizon ke bare main jaankaree jutani he
 Everything that Indrani knew she has told you and also where she left Sheena
 
 
 tumhaare paas uskaa massej bhi aayaa tha
 rahul-hapiter - So now go and find him, where is he or anything
 or plis is kaam ko karo
 rahul-hapiter - Neither i nor Indrani can tell you anything now
 ham ummid karte hai ki vah thik ho
 rahul-okpeeter - Now you can walk as you wish
 
 
 yahi bilkul thik bhi he
 rahul-yes of course and i should do the same

 a traveler shouted, 'malik sahib, you are no longer a minister
 agar aap hai to bhi ham aapaki parvaah nahin karte

 Wakwani also left the plane after hooting for a long time

 The enthusiasts of Gujarat assembly elections have intensified
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar panchayat ajtak ke manch par aae purv mukhyamantri shankar singh waghela ne kaha ki gujarat main congress kii haar modi ke vikaas model kii vajah se nahin, balki apni party kii kalah se he
 He said that in the 2012 assembly elections, Congress changed 28 tickets at the last minute
 agar ye tikat nahin badale jate to bijepi haar jaati
 At the behest of the Congress high command, tickets were given, the worker was ignored
 shankar singh waghela ne kaha ki raajnneetik dalon main aantarik loktantr nahin he
 Today there is no party that has any ideology
 sabhi partiyon ko satta kaa laalach he
 Vaghela said that i kept saying that Congress mlas are about to leave the party but the Congress high command remained silent
 jaise match phixing chal rahi ho
 Vaghela said that the people of Gujarat are not like pendulums
 wo congress se naakhush hokar bijepi ke paas gai or usne 20 saal se use satta saunp rakhi he
 If the public is disappointed with BJP also, should it go to the Congress again
 kyon teesraa vikalp nahin hona chahie
 When Vaghela was asked that he was being called the bjp's b team, which is in the fray to defeat the Congress, Vaghela's answer was whether Kejriwal formed the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi to defeat the Congress
 hamaare jitne bhi point hai wo sarkaar ke khilaaf hai
 To call us bjp's b team is an insult to the public
 ham teesraa vikalp denge
 Vaghela was asked when there was no history of a third option in Gujarat
 keshu bhai patel ne koshish kii thi lekin vifal rahe isapar waghela ne kaha ki vikalp har jagah hota he
 Was the AAP party in Delhi? biju patnayak kii party kya thi pehle, shivasena pehle thi kya, mulaayam kii party thi kya
 If Mamata went to Banerjee, did she go to break the vote of BJP or Congress or CPM
 sab apane liye jate hai
 Vaghela said that in Gujarat there is some Leua Patel, some Kadua, some Kshatriyas, some Parmars, some Dalits, some Brahmins
 yahaan tisare morche kii bharpoor sambhaavnaaen hai
 We will give tickets by asking the people and will not make the candidate what the public calls corrupt

 correction Android smartphones are the victim of malware the day they arrive
 ek baar phir se kuch researchrs ne ek nayaa mailaware dhundha he
 This malware replaces Android apps with its own code
 aisa puri tarah nahin hota, balki kuch had tak riples kiya jaataa he
 According to the report, 25 million Android smartphones around the world have been affected by this agent Smith named malware
 bharat main is mailaware se sabase zyada android divaais prabhavit hai
 The report is saying that around 1 in India
 5 karod android divaais is mailevyar se prabhavit hai
 Security firm Check Point has detected Agent Smith malware
 yah mailaware android oparating system kii kamajoriyon kaa phayda uthaa kar smartphone main maujuud eps ko khatarnaak varjan ke eps se riples kar detaa he
 The scary thing is that it is done without user's permission
 Check Point ke mobile thread ditection research head Jonathan Schimonovich ne kaha he, ‘ye mailaware chupake se yugers dwaara install kiye gaye eps ko atake karata he or ye aam android yugers ke liye ise dhund paanaa chalanging banaata he’yah Agent Smith mailaware divaais main broad acces lekar yugers ko frod vaale vigyaapan dikhaata he taaki ataikars ko iskaa phayda ho sake
 However, this malware can be used for a larger purpose
 report ke mutabik is mailaware se banking credential yani jaankariyaan chori ho sakati hai
 You will remember about copycat malware, it works in the same way
 report ke mutabik Agent Smith sabase pehle ek third party ap store 9apps se downlod kiya gaya tha or isamen hindi, arabic, russian or indocian yugers ko torget kiya tha
 The Check Point security firm says that Agent Smith is the primary Victim Indian of malware
 haalanki duusare desh jaise pakistan or bangladesh main bhi iskaa prabhaav he
 Apart from this, this malware also targets Android devices in the US, Australia and UK
 security form ne ye saaf kar diya he ki google ke saath company ne mil kar kaam kiya he or ab play store par aisa koi khatarnaak ap nahin he
 Since this malware is spread through the Third Party App Store, you should be careful and avoid downloading the app from any third party App Store

 UP board results will be announced, results of 10th and 12th congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi is baar ko loksabhaa chunaav main amethi ke saath-saath kerala kii vynad sansadeey seat se chunavi maidan main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 Let me tell you that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi had won from Vadodara seat of Gujarat as well as from Kashi's Rann from Purvanchal to Bihar
 isi tarj par rahul ne vynad ko chunaa he
 Through this, not only Kerala but the whole of South India is being considered as a strategy
 bataa den ki congress ne ravivaar ko aadhikarik taur par elaan kar diya he ki party adhyaksh rahul gandhi is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main do siton se chunavi maidan main utrenge
 Rahul Gandhi will contest from his traditional seat Amethi and also try his luck from the Wayanad seat, popularly known as the strong fortress of Congress for the purpose of serving South India
 congress ise jahaan uttar bharat ke saath-saath south ko saadhane kaa daanv bataa rahaa he
 At the same time, BJP is creating an atmosphere in Amethi by telling Rahul fear of defeat
 itnaa hi nahin bijepi rahul ke vynad se chunaav ladane ke faisle ko unke nanihaal italy se jodate hue isai prem bataaya he
 BJP national spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad said, Rahul Gandhi is feeling uneasy, insecure and helpless in Amethi
 isliye unhone vynad seat ko apane 'ethnic profil' kii vajah se surakshit maanate hue vahaan se chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 'let us know that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi had fielded from Vadodara seat of Gujarat as well as Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh
 bijepi ko iskaa phayda bhi mila tha
 The BJP did well in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, winning all the seats in Gujarat
 isi tarj par rahul gandhi ne upi ke saath-saath kerala ke maidan main utarane faisla kiya he
 Like Amethi and Rae Bareli, Wayanad Lok Sabha seat is also considered a Congress dominated seat
 yah seat 2008 main parisemen ke baad raajnneetik vajood main ai
 This seat is made up of Kannur, Malappuram and Wayanad parliamentary constituencies
 congress netaa emai shanvaas pichley do baar se sipiai ko maat dekar saansad bane the
 This seat is such that where BJP has never been in the race
 aise main congress adhyaksh ke liye kaaphi surakshit maani ja rahi he
 It is believed that the decision to contest from Wayanad seat has been taken by Rahul Gandhi and Congress in view of strengthening the party in South India
 congress vynad seat ke jariye kerala, karnataka or tamilnadu ko saadhane kii ranneeti maani ja rahi he
 In fact, there has been such a continuous demand in South India that he be represented on the throne of power in Delhi
 mana ja rahaa he ki congress is daanv se dakshin bharatiyon kaa dil jeetna chaahati he
 Rahul is looking at the Congress from this seat as a strategy to help the whole South by getting into the electoral arena
 desh main narsimha raav desh ke pehle pradhanmantri bane the jo dakshin bharat se aate the
 HD Deve Gowda was formed after this
 dilachasp baat ye he ki donon ke piem banane main congress kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 Narasimha Rao became PM in 1991 when Congress formed the government and HD Deve Gowda was elected PM with the support of Congress in 1996
 rahul gandhi dakshin ke ran main utarkar sameekaran saadhane kii ranneeti rahi he
 At one time, South India was considered a stronghold of the Congress, but over time the Chhatrapas have taken over the Congress land
 aise main rahul dakshin ke siyaasi ran main khud utarkar apni siyaasi jameen ko waapas paane kii he
 The Wayanad Lok Sabha seat is considered to be Muslim and Christian dominated
 vynad main 49 fisadi hindu hai to 51 fisadi muslim or isai aabaadi he
 Seven assembly constituencies fall under the Wayanad parliamentary seat
 is sansadeey kshetra main manantavadi, tiruvambady, vandur, sultanbatheri, eranad, kalapatta or nilambur vidhansabha siten aati hai
 Three of them are in Wayanad district, 3 in Mallapuram and 1 in Kozhikode district
 vynad or mallpuram ilaake main congress or ol india muslim lig kii majboot pakad maani jaati he
 This is the reason why the Congress has been winning continuously for the last two Lok Sabha elections
 aise main rahul ke liye vynad kii raah main bahut zyada dikkatein nahin hongi
