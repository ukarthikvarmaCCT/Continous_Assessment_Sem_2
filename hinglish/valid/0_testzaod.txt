 The seventh edition was published by Bharti Bhandar
 tab iskaa mukhaprishth baayi ore die gaye chitra ke anusaar do rang vaala tha
 It was then published by Rajkamal Prakashan
 isko niraala ne sistar nivedita ko samarpit kiya he
 It contains 80 poems selected by Mahakavi Nirala from all his collections published till 1946
 chayan swayan niraala ne kiya tha, isliye isaki mahatta swatahsiddh he
 a complete introduction to the poetic form of Nirala can be obtained from the poems compiled here, in that sense this compilation is the ocean in Gagar
 niraala kii aatma nai disha khojane ke liye sadaa se vikal rahi thi or aparaa tak yah khoj teen dashak paar kar chuki thi
 In this compilation, even an odd combination of several lines is found in his compositions
 ek ore unka darshan un rahasyamay sookshm tattavon kaa saath nahin chhodana chahta jo yugon yugon kaa arjeet anubhuti vaibhav he or duusari ore unki parthivta dharti ke us gurutv se baandhe hue he, jo aaj kii pehali aavashyaktaa he
 On the one hand, his cultural vision fills the bright colors in every line of antiquity, and on the other hand, his modernity keeps on lighting all the colors by burning it in the flame of satire
 komal madhur geeton kii vanshi se oj ke shankh tak unki swar sadhana kaa utaar chadhaav he
 Nirala is the masterpiece of the shadow age, who gave rise to the rebellion in life, giving free subtle sky of music's voice and emotion
 ve aise yug kaa bhi pratinidhitiv kar rahe hai, jo us vidroh kaa parichay kathor dharti par visham kanth main chahta he
 There are three epics under Brihatatrayi - "kiratarajunya", "shishupalavadh" and "nasadharcharitha"
 bhamah or dandi dwaara paribhaashit mahakavy lakshan kii roodhiyon ke anuroop nirmit hone vaale madhyayug ke alankaran pradhan sanskrit mahakavyon main ye teenon kritiyaan atyant vikhyath or pratishthabhaajan baniin
 In Kalidasa's poetry, the flow of the narrative is the dynamic, the simple, but effective expression of the expression of the human mind, the generality of the canvas of history - these poems target their disregard
 chote chote varnya vritton ko lekar mahakavy roodhiyon ke vistrut varnanon or kalatmak, alankarik or shastreey uktiyon evam chamatkaaramayi abhivyaktiyon dwaara kavy kii akaarmurti ko inamen vistaar mila he
 These trends have increased more and more in Kiratarjunjya, Shishupalavadh and Nishidharcharit respectively
 isi se kuch pandit, is harshavardhanottar sanskrit sahitya ko kavyasrjan kii drushti se "hrasonmukhyugin" maanate hai
 But the orthodox practices of orthodox poetry appear with great flourish in these poems
 in kaavyon main bhashaa kii kalaatmakataa, shabdarthlankaaron ke gunfan dwaara uktigat chamatkarasarjan, chitra or shlisht kavyavidhan kaa sayas kaushal, vividh viharakeliyon or varnanon kaa sangrathan aadi kavy ke rumrup or kalapaksheeya praudhata ke nidarshak hai
 Among them, the color of the descriptions of the Valasic circumference of Shringarras is indeterminately vivid
 hriday ke bhavaprerit, anubhutibodh kii sahaj kii apeksha, vasanamulak andriya vilasita kaa adhik udwelan he
 Then the maturity of the erudition, the brilliance of the expression and the power of expression, have made his poetry poetic
 sahityakshetra kaa pandit banane ke liye inkaa adhyayan anivaary mana gaya he
 It is the first and the least in terms of size in the epics of Brihattrayi
 iske nirmaataa bharavi ne apane kavy main swavrittaparichayatmak kuch bhi nahin likhaa he
 The only basis for fame as Mahakavi is Kiratarjanya
 pramanik aitihaasik vivaran unke vishay main anyatra bhi anuplabdh he
 The mention of the inscription "iohal" inscription in 634 AD and the indication of Dandi's "avantisundarikatha" is inferred that "bharavi" was a Paramasiva and Dakshinatya poet

 The Kathavastu Prakriti, adapted from the Mahabharata of Kiratarajunya Kavya, is small - Yudhishthira, along with the brothers, was living in duality

 The Mahadveda, the Kirathaveshadhi, first protects Arjuna, and then pleases the invincible Divyastra in Parikshayayuddha, pleased with Arjuna's valor
 yaheen kavy samaapt hota he
 This poem begins with the word 'shri'
 kalatmak alankaranwali kavyastylee ke anusri is kavy main shabd or arth ubhaymulak anlakaaron kaa chamatkaar, varna or shabd kaa aadhrut chitrakavyata, aprastut vidhaan kaa kalpanaaparak lalit sangyojan aadi utkrisht rup main shilpit hai, raajnneeti or vyavhaaraniti ke upadesh, prabhaavapurn samvaad, aadi se is kavy kaa nirmanshilp atyant sajjit he
 It has imaginative descriptions of seasons, mountains, rivers, sunrise, sunset, etc
, following the epic trait of Dandi
 shringaar ras kii vividh keliyon or prasangon ke kaamshastreey vivaranchitron dwaara laghukathavstu vaale is kavy main paryaapt vistaar hua he
 Its main organ is "ras" Veer
 phir bhi shringaar ke vilasaparak sandarbh isamen bade aasanjan se varnit hai
 Excellent art appears in the scheme of Sadharmyamukala Upama Nattarakshadi ornate
 is kavy main lakshith arthgaurav kii badi prashansa hui he
 The smooth flow of Bhavapaksha is well maintained in the context of "veer", "shringar" etc
 even though it is secondary than Kalapaksha
 valmiki or kalidas kii sahjanubhuti kaa abadhitvilas na rahane par bhi kavy main varnanalaalitya kaa abhaav nahin he
 This poem is definitely of ornate poetry-style
 isamen buddhi or hriday, shringarrasikata or raajnneeti kushalta, varnananapunya or kalatmak chamatkaar ek saath milte hai
 Its poetry is unique in its form
 parantu shishupal vadh main kiratarjuneey kii apeksha sab drushtiyon se utkarsh yoga adhik he
 According to the Sanskrit poet's pacific subhashikoti, in this epic of the Magha poet, the three metaphors of Kalidasa, Bharavi's Artha Gaurava and Dandi's Padalatyaya are all collected
 kalidas kaa bhavapravaah, bharavi kaa kalanapunya or bhattikaar ke vyakaranpanditya ke ekatra yoga se uskaa utkarsh bad gaya he
 The use of idiomatic language of Paninian Sanskrit is also superior to Shishupala Slaughter Bhatti Poetry in Neptune
 bhavahrasonmukhi alankritakavyayugin sanskrit kaavyon main sarvaadhik priy maghakavy ko pathpradarshak or adarsh maan liya gaya tha
 The only available epic of Magha is his epochal record

 His grandfather Suprabhadeva was the Prime Minister at a king named "dharamnam", the ruler of a province under Gujarat

 The Magadhapati were extremely thankful and kind

 Their extant period is considered by most scholars to be the late seventh century
 janashrutiyon main kaha jaataa he ki shishupalavadh kii rachana kiratarjuneey ke anukaran par hui thi
 Padyadi and pictographic vocabulary poetry with monosyllabic duality are also here and political consultancy in the first two cantos
 spasht hi is par bharavikavy kii pratichhaya he
 But in terms of description of ornate-poetic-composition-skill and nature, Shishupalavadha is very excellent as compared to the tenant
 iske varnan paandityapurna, alankrita or roodhisanwalit hone par bhi bade sapraan hai
 They have direct observation of the poet and liveliness of the raga
 kiraatkavyatulya alankritavarnan kii style par chalakar bhi iske vishayvarnanon main bhavataralata, abhivyanjanstyli kii praudhata, murttapratyakshikaran, samarth alankaravidhan aadi se yah kavy atyant saras or praudh kaha jaataa he
 But it also has a Mahabharata, the original story short, which has gone from narration to inflation
 atyaachaar or bal se trast trailoky kii dasha naarad se sunakar krishna, balram or uddhav ne mantranaa kii or pandavon ke rajasuya yajna main jane kaa nishchay kiya
 Journey, rest, etc
 from the third canto to the Trayodash canto is a description of the intermittent episodes and viharakelis where there is a complete lack of sustenance of the chronicles
 chaudaaven se lekar biswein sarg tak yudhisthir ke rajasuya yajna tathaa krishna or shishupal ke yuddh evam tatsambaddha avaantar prasangon kaa kalatmak or alankrita varnan he
 This poem is also mainly of Veer Rasa but endowed with oily bananas and lustful sweetness of beauty
 parantu vir ras se samprukt varnan bhi isamen bade jeevant or prabhaavshaalee hai
 The main story is mainly in numerical circles 1, 2, 14 and 20
 paratu shringaari varnanon main - visheshat: vibhavanubhaavon ke ankan main sanshlisht chitra sajiv or gatimay hai
 Their nature description is also cumbersome due to the burden of adornment of unprepared laws
 ve swabhaavokti or praudhokti dwividh nirmaan ke nishnaat shilpi hai
 Overall, Shishupalavadha is the finest poem of its kind, whose impressive poeticity and generosity are unmatched
 alankrita kavyrachana style kii pradhantavaale maghottarayugi kaviyon dwaara nirmit kaavyon main alankaran pradhanta, praudhokti kalpana se prerit varnan pransgon kii sphitata tathaa paandityalabdh gyanagarishthata atisangyojan aadi kii pravriti badi
 The full climax of that interest can be seen in Sriharsha's medical chart
 brihattrayee ke is brihattam mahakavy kaa mahakavi, nyaay, mimasaa, yogashastra aadi kaa udbhat vidvan tha or tha taarkik paddati kaa mahaan advait vedanti
 In the Naishdha, the classical vaishutya and the great flight of imagination, Adyant is seen
 is mahakavy kaa mul aadhaar he "mahabharat" kaa "nalopakhyaan"
 Necessary changes in the original form of the original story have also been done here and there
 aisa maaloom padataa he ki is puranakatha kii lokapriyata ne bade pracheen kaal se hi ise lokkatha bana diya he
 For this reason, the poet also took some elements from there
 yah mahakavy aadyant shringaari he
 Purvarag, Viraha, Swan's cremation, Swayambara, nal-damayanti-vivah, the couple's first encounter and the Ashtayamacharya and the fragmentary narrative of Sanyukavilas have been greatly enlarged by poet's narrators and imaginative Vaidushyavilas

 With the help of the flight of his imagination, the same portrait by Pandit Kavi has been elaborated in many forms by various new unaided schemes

 Nature of nature, pathology, metaphor, metaphor, inspirational exaggeration, divergence, syllogism etc
 Supporting the use of semantics, alliterative, lexical, authoritative use of vignette miracles and the amazing ability to use the appropriation of dictionaries, poignant, mature and expedient planning of classical aspects, imaginations and Proper insertion of images, first-mogul This poetry has continued to have unprecedented respect in Sanskrit pandimandali till date due to its lifelong marking of shame and utterance, the ornamental poetic style of ornamentation and miracle and its pedagogy
 magh kavi se bhi adhik sriharsh ne ise kavyabadhak paandityapradarshan ke yoga se bahut badha diya he jisase laghukthanakwala kavy ati vrihat ho gaya he
 Being insensitive in marking the skills of Shringari villas and chiefly Kailas and the luxuries of Rasik Nagars, the poet's philosophical generosity increased poetic place in poetry
 punarukti, chyutsamskruti aadi anek dosha bhi yatra tatra dhunde ja sakate hai
 But even after his stay, the artist's amazing talent has shone in the epic due to his grandeur and sublime, imaginativeness and generosity, pedagogy and euphoria, even when ornamented, there is a spontaneous luxury in his play

 ek baar bhagwat-anuraagi tathaa puneatma maharishiyon ne shri vedavyas ke param shishy sutaji se prarthana kii-he gyanasagar ! aapke shrimukh se vishnu bhagwaan or shankar ke daivi charitra tathaa adbhut lilaayen sunakar ham bahut sukhi hue
 Faith in God increased and knowledge gained
 ab krupa kar maanav jati ko samast sukhon ko uplabdh karaane vaale, atmik shakti dene vaale tathaa bhoga or moksh pradaan karaane vaale pavithratam puraana aakhyaan sunaakar anugrihit kiijie
 Knowing the sincere desire of the knowledgeable and humble Mahatmas, Mahamuni Sutaji accepted the grace
 unhone kaha-jan kalyaan kii laalasaa se aapane badi sundar ichha prakat kii
 i tell you to him
 yah sach he ki shri mad devi bhagwat puraana sabhi shastron tathaa dharmik granthon main mahaan he
 Big pilgrimage and fast are negligible in front of it
 is puraana ke sunne se paap sookhe van kii bhaanti jalakar nasht ho jate hai, jisase manushya ko shok, klesh, du:kha aadi nahin bhogane padate
 Just as darkness is cut off in front of the sunlight, similarly, hearing of Bhagavat Purana eliminates all the sufferings, diseases and inhibitions of human beings
 mahatmaon ne sutaji se bhagwat puraana ke sambandh main ye jigyaasaaen rakhin: By the combination of Maharishi Parashar and Goddess Satyavati, Anshvatar Dev Vyasji of Srinarayan was born
 vyasaji ne apane samay or samaaj kii sthiti pahachaanate hue vedon ko chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya or apane chaar patu shishyon ko unka bodh karaayaa
 After this, he created eighteen Puranas for the welfare of the male and female retarded women, who were deprived of the right to study, so that they too would be able to practice religion
 sutaji ne kaha-mahatman! guruji ke aadeshaanusaar satraa puraanon ke prasar evam prachaar kaa daayitv mujh par aayaa, kintu bhoga or mokshadaata bhagwat puraana swayan guruji ne janmejay ko sunaaya
 You know - Janmejaya's father Raja Parikshit was bitten by the Takshak serpent and the king listened to Srimad Bhagavat Purana for the welfare of his murder
 raja ne nau din nirantar lokmata bhagwati durga kii puja-aradhana kii tathaa muni vedavyas ke mukh se lokmata kii mahima se purna bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya
 Sutji said - Mahatma! According to Guruji's responsibility, the responsibility of spreading and propagating seventeen Puranas came upon me, but the Bhog and Mokshadata Bhagavata Purana itself was narrated by Guruji to Janmejaya
 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha
 The king worshiped Lokmata Bhagwati Durga for nine days continuously and listened to the full Bhagavata Purana with the glory of Lokmata from the mouth of Muni Ved Vyasa
 shri krishna prasenjit ko dhundhane ke prayaas main kho gaye the jo shri devi bhagwati ke aashirwad se sakushal laut aae
 While narrating this account in detail with the wishes of the Maharishi, Mr
 Sutji started saying - Gentlemen Long ago, Bhojwanshi King Satrajit lived in Dwarka Puri
 surya kii bhakthi-aradhana ke bal par usne swamantak naam kii atyant chamakdaar mani praapt kii
 Due to the revolution of Mani, the king himself became sun-like
 is bhram main jab yadavon ne shrikrishna se bhagwaan surya ke aagaman kii baat kahi, tab antaryami krishna ne yadavon kii shankaa kaa nivaaran karte hue kaha ki aane vaale mahanubhav swamantak manidhari raja satrajit hai, surya nahin
 The virtue of the self-styled gem was that the person holding it would receive eight kilos of gold per day
 us pradesh main kisi bhi prakaar kii maanviya yaa divine vipatti kaa koi chihn tak nahin tha
 Krishna himself aspired to receive the Swatantak Mani, but Satrajit rejected it
 ek baar satrajit kaa bhai prasenjit us mani ko dhaaran karke ghode par chadhakar shikaar ko gaya to ek singh ne use maar daalaa
 Incidentally, a bear named Jamwant killed Singh and he took Mani to his cave
 jamavant kii beti mani ko khilonaa samajhakar khilne lagi
 On Prasenjit's return, a rumor spread in Dwarka that Krishna was assassinated by Sranjith's refusal to grant Mani to Krishna and took possession of Mani
 krishna is afvaah se du:khee hokar prasenjit ko khojane ke liye nikal pade
 In the forest, Krishna and his companions found a lion dead along with Prasenjit
 unhen vahaan rich ke pairon ke nishaanon ke sanket bhi mili, jo bheetar gupha main pravesh ke suchak the
 With this Krishna speculated to kill Singh and near Mani's bear
 apane saathiyon ko baahar rahakar pratiksha karne ke liye kahkar swayan krishna gupha ke bheetar pravesh kar gaye
 After a long time, the returned companion, disheartened when Krishna did not return, falsely propagated the death of Krishna
 krishna ke na lautne par unke pita vasudev putr-shok main vyathit ho uthe
 At the same time Maharishi Narada came
 samachar jaanakar naradji ne vasudev se shrimad devi bhagwat puraana ke shravan kaa upadesh diya
 Vasudev was previously familiar with the grace of Mother Bhagwati
 unhone naradji se kaha-devarshi, devaki ke saath karagaravaas karte hue jab chha: putr kansa ke haathon maare ja chuke the to ham donon pati-patni kaaphi vyathit or ansatulit ho gaye the
 Then he consulted his clan priest Maharishi Garg and asked for a solution to get rid of trouble
 gurudev ne jagadamba maa kii gaatha kaa parayan karne ko kaha
 Being in prison was not possible for me
 at: gurudev se hi yah kaary sampann karaane kii prarthana kii
 Vasudev said - By accepting my prayer, Gurudev went to Vindhyachal mountain and worshiped the goddess with the Brahmins
 vidhi-vidhanpurvak devi bhagwat kaa nawahr yajna kiya
 On completion of the ritual, Gurudev informing me of this, said - Goddess has pleased this Akashvani - With my inspiration, Vishnu himself will incarnate the house of Vasudev Devaki to alleviate the suffering of the earth
 vasudev ko chahie ki us balak ko gokul gram ke nand-yashoda ke ghar pahunchaa den or usee samay utpann yashoda kii balika ko laakar aathvin santan ke rup main kansa ko saunp den
 Kans, as always, would throw the baby girl to the ground
 vah balika kansa ke haath se tatkaal chhootakar divya sharir dhaaran kar, mere hi ansh rup se lok kalyaan ke liye vidhyanchal parvat par vaas karegi
 On hearing this ritual fruit by Garga Muni, i expressed happiness and completed the following events according to Muni's statement and protected Krishna
 yah vivaran sunaakar vasudev naradji se kehane lage-muniver ! saubhaahgya se aapkaa aagaman mere liye shubh he
 Therefore, please oblige me by narrating the story of Goddess Bhagwat Purana
 vasudev ke kehane par naarad ne anugrah karte hue nawahr parayan kiya
 At the end of the ninth day, Vasudeva worshiped Naradji and when Krishna entered the cave from the Maya of Bhagwati's mother, he saw a girl playing with a gem
 jaise hi krishna ne balika se mani lee, to balika ro uthi
 Hearing the crying of the girl, Jamwant arrived there and started fighting with Krishna
 donon main sattaees din tak yuddh chalata rahaa
 By the grace of Goddess, Jamwant continued to suffer and Shri Krishna became powerful
 ant main unhone jamavant ko parajeet kar diya
 By the grace of Bhagwati, Jamwant had a prior memory
 treta main ravan kaa vadh karne vaale ram ko hi dwapar main krishna ke rup main avatarit jaanakar unki vandana kii
 Apologized for the crime committed in ignorance
 mani ke saath apni putree jambavati ko bhi prasantaapurvak krishna ko samarpit kar diya
 After the narrative ended in Mathura, Vasudev was taking blessings after the Brahmin banquet, at the same time Krishna reached there with Mani and Jambavati
 krishna ko vahaan dekhakar sabhi kii prasannataa kii koi seemaa na rahi
 In gratitude to Bhagwati, vasudev-devaki welcomed Shri Krishna with tearful eyes
 vasudev kaa safal kaam banaakar naarad devloak waapas laut gaye
 According to the Goddess Bhagwat Purana, Sutji while narrating this story to the incoming monks said, Sridvalu sages! The devotees should take advice from any astrologer to get the auspicious time for Katha Shravan or it is suitable for Navratras
 is anushthan kii soochna vivaah ke samaan hi apane sabhi bandhu-baandhvon, sage-sambandhiyon, parichiton, brahman, kshatriyon, vaishyon, shudron evam striyon ko bhi aamantrit karnaa chahie
 Whoever can give more time in listening, definitely give it
 sabhi aagantukon kaa swaagat satkar aayojan kaa dharm he
 The place of legend should be dipped with cow dung and hang a dome shaped canopy over it and hoist a flag containing goddess image over it
 katha sunaane ke liye sadaachari, karmkandi, nirlobhi kushal upadeshak ko hi niyukt karnaa chahie
 Retire from morning bath, etc
, and put a clean cloth and establish a Kalash
 ganesh, navagraha, yogini, maatrakaa, kshetrapal, batuka, tulsi vishnu tathaa shankar aadi kii puja karke bhagwati durga kii aradhana kerani chahie
 Goddess Bhagwat Granth should be worshiped by worshiping Goddess Shodashopachara and pray for the Goddess Yagya to end uninterrupted
 pradakshina or namaskara karte hue devi kii stuti prarambh kerani chahie
 After that, one should listen to the Devi Katha while meditating
 katha ke shravankaal main shrota athwa vaktaa ko kshor karm nahin karwaanaa chahie
 Sleeping celibacy on the ground, simple food restraint, pure conduct, true speech, and fasting for non-violence should be taken
 taamas padaarth yatha-pyaaj, lahasun, maance, madiraa aadi kaa bhakshan bhi varjit he
 The female affair should be forcibly abandoned
 navahn yajna kii samaapti par nawein din anushthan kaa udhyapan karnaa chahie
 On that day both the speaker and the Bhagavata Purana should be worshiped
 brahman tathaa kumarikaon ko bhojan evam dakshina dekar trupt karnaa chahie
 Home to the Gayatri Mantra, donating it to the Bhagavata Purana speaker Brahmin installed on the Golden Manjusha, should leave him satisfied with Dakshinadi
 purvokt vidhi-vidhaan se nishkaam bhav se parayan karne vaala shrota shraddhalu mokshapad ko or sakaam bhav se parayan karne vaala apane abhisht ko praapt karata he
 At the time of storytelling, any type of conversation, meditation, change of posture, sleeplessness or insolence can cause great loss, so do not do this
 sutaji maharaj ne kaha-atharah puraanon main devi bhagwat puraana usee prakaar sarvottam he, jis prakaar nadiyon main ganga, devon main shankar, kaavyon main ramayana, prakaash sroton main surya, sheetaltaa or ahlad main chandramaa, kshamashilon main prithvi, gambhirtha main sagar or mantron main gayatri aadi shreshth hai

 samucchy siddhanth, ganit kii ek shakha he jo samucchyon kaa adhyayan karti he
 a collection of objects is called a set
 yadhyapi samucchy ke antargat kisi bhi prakaar kii vastuon kaa sangrah sambhav he, kintu samucchy siddhanth mukhyatah ganit se sambandhit samucchyon kaa hi adhyayan karata he
 Broadly, synonyms of the English set are 'set', aggregate, class, domain and totality
 samucchy main avyavon kaa vibhinn hona aavashyak he
 The set theory, organized by first-class logic, is the most commonly used fundamental system of mathematics today
 samucchy siddhanth kii bhashaa ganit ke lagbhag sabhi vastuon ko paribhaashit karne ke kaam aati he
 The initial concepts of the set theory are so simple that they can be taught in the curriculum of primary schools
 aadhunik samucchy siddhanth kaa armbh george cantre evam dedkind ne san 1870 main kiya
 Describes the members of a set of members in the following four ways: writing to all members; kuch sadasyon ko likhane ke baad dot-dot lagaakar chhod dena; Giving a description, such as bijganit kii sahaayta se; Finite set: with a limited number of members, eg {3,7,9}
 aparimit samucchy : jiske sadasyon kii sankhya aseemit ho, jaise A={2,4,6,8, xxrep 13 
 } Empty set or zero set: in which the number of members is zero or which has no member
 ise ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset } athwa {} se nirupit karte hai
 ∈ { \ displaystyle \ in} denotes who is a member of a set
 udhaaharan ke liye, S={2,5,6,7,9} kaa ek sadsy 7 he
 We can write that 7 ∈ s { \ displaystyle 7 \ in S}, in contrast the ∉ { \ displaystyle \ notin} sign indicates that something is not a member of the set
 jaise 3 sankhya purvokt samucchy s kaa sadsy nahin he; ise ham likhte hai ki 3 ∉ s { \ displaystyle 3 otin S} 
 "∈ { \ displaystyle \ in}" This sign is called 'member'
 yadi kisi samucchy a ke sabhi sadsy kisi anya samucchy b ke bhi sadsy hai to yah kaha jaataa he ki A, b kaa upasamucchy he
 For example, if a = {p, q, r} and b = {p, q, r, s}, we write that a ⊂ b { \ displaystyle a \ subset B} must be two subsets of each set; One is itself a subset of itself, the second set of zeros is a subset of all the sets
 samucchy {a,b,c} ke sabhi upasamucchyon ko likhen to ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset }, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c} evam {a,b,c} tathaa shunya samucchy
 If a set has n members, the number of all its subsets will be 2 n { \ displaystyle 2 ^ {n}}
 jis upasamucchy main sadasyon kii sankhya mul samucchy ke sadasyon kii sankhya se kam ho use 'uchit upasamucchy' kehete hai
 The set formed by taking all the existing components in a problem is called an all-inclusive set relative to that problem
 udhaaharan ke liye, 11 sankhya tak sabhi visham sankhyaon kaa sarvasamaveshi samucchy hoga - ξ { \ displaystyle \ xi \ } ={1,3,5,7,9,11} Many problems of set theory are easily solved using the Venn diagram
 sarvasamaveshi samucchy ko ek aayat dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he tathaa iske sabhi upasamucchyon ko vrutt dwaara darshaya jaataa he
 In this diagram the complementary set of a is shown by shading, ie a c { \ displaystyle a ^ {c}}
 iske alaava vrutt ke bheetar vrutt banaakar upasamucchyon ko darshaate hai
 Such as b ⊆ a { \ displaystyle b \ subseteq A} do samucchy a or b hon to inkaa sarvanishtha samucchy vah samucchy hoga jisamen ve sadsy honge jo a or b donon main hon
 For example, if a = {2,4,7} and b = {2,3,7,8}, then the common set of a and b will be {2,7} which we write as: a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} = {2,7} What is shown by the shadow in the Venn diagram in the picture is a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B}
 do samucchy a or b kaa sangh vah samucchy he jiske sadsy ve hai jo a main hai, yaa b main hai yaa donon main hai
 For example, if a = {3,4,6} and b = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then we will write the union of these two sets as: a ∪ b { \ displaystyle a \ cup B} = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
 yadi do samucchyon a or b main koi bhi sadsy ubhaynishth nahin he to in donon samucchyon ko asamyukt samucchy kaha jaataa he
 We write it like this: a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} = ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset} samucchy main avyavon kaa vibhinn hona aavashyak he
 If x is any element of the set A, we write: x ∈ A
 sabhi avyavon kaa byora na dekar, unhen niyam dwaara bhi bataaya ja saktaa he, jaise visham sankhyaon kaa samucchy
 b is called a subset of a when each element of b is a member of a and writes it as: b ⊂ A
 It reads as follows: b is included in A
 yadi a main kam se kam ek aisa avyav ho jo b kaa sadsy nahin he or B, a kaa upasamucchy he, to b ko a kaa vaastavik upasamucchy kehete hai
 Such a set, which does not have a single component, is called a zero set and expresses it with φ
 shunya samucchy saidhantik vivechan main upyogi hote hai
 The basic verbs on sets are: logical sum, logical multiplication, logical differential
 taarkik yoga or gunan saamaanya bijganit ke saahchary, kramavinimeya or vitaran niyamon kaa paalan karte hai
 The function p { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {P}}} for the relation ⊆ { \ displaystyle \ subseteq} is partially ordered, for all A, B, c ⊆ x { \ displaystyle A, B, c \ subseteq X} ,: samucchyon kaa sarvanishtha ∩ { \ displaystyle \ cap } tathaa sangh ∪ { \ displaystyle \ cup } kramavinimeya, saahchary tathaa vitaran niyamon kaa paalan karata he: The following rules apply for differences: samamit antar ke liye nimnlikhit niyam lagu hote hai: He became MLA in 2013

 uski praarambhik shiksha apni mata kii dekharekh main hui thi, jo apane samay ke "pavitra maarg" naamak dharmik andolan se bahut prabhavit thi
 Therefore, at an early age, he was interested in righteous conduct, simple, well-organized and professional life
 16 varsh kii aayu main, "collegium fidericaanum" kii shiksha samaapt kar, vah konigsburg ke vishvavidhyalay main pravisht hua, jahaan chah varsh usne bhautikashastra, ganit, darshan evam dharamshastra kaa adhyayan kiya
 For nine years after leaving university, Kant moved to a village called Judskin, 60 miles from Königsberg
 vahaan vah do teen pariwaron main adhyaapan kaary kar apni jeevika chalaata or bhautikashastra tathaa darshan main swadhyay karata rahaa
 In the meantime, many of his articles and epics were published, two of which are "special Considerations on the Approximation of Living Powers" and "general Natural History and Theory of the Akash"

 He had also submitted the necessary arrangements for the degree of "doctor's Legacy" in 1755 AD and the University of Königsberg certified his qualification by granting him the said degree
 kintu uski vyaktigat samasyaon main koi parivartan na hua
 Pleased with his nine years of hard work, the university had appointed him a distinguished lecturer, but he did not get paid for this work

 main use adhyaapan ke saath-saath sahaayak pustkaalay prabandhak bhi niyukt kiya gaya or ab use das pound vaarshik vetan milane laga
 For four years, Kant also worked in this form, but he continued to study, think and write
 "privet dogent" niyukt hone ke baad se 1770i tak uske paanch prakaran granth prakashit hue– The titles of the above texts suggest that the time between 1755 and 1770 AD was the creation of Kant's ideas

 In the same year, he was appointed to the same teacher of logic and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, for which he had to be disappointed 12 years ago
 pehle se ab vah chintamukt bhi ho gaya tha kyonki use 60 pound vaarshik vetan milane laga tha
 In those days, such salaries were paid only to respectable teachers

 Kant earned only 30 pounds from his "critique of Pure Reason"

 Even after 1796 AD, he was busy studying, thinking and writing, but these eight years of his life were spent in a very pathetic condition
 uski smriti itani ksheen ho gai thi ki use choti-moti baaten bhi likhakar yaad rakhni padati thim
 He did not have the power to take care of his own house; He did not marry, but during the teaching period of 42 years, he made a good impression on his colleagues and students

 All the stories and stories related to this have been on the tongue of the people for the last several decades

 Actually, this temple was built for the idol of Lord Rama, but it did not move from its place when the idol was installed
 is murti ko madhukar shah ke rajyakaal ke dauraan unki rani ganesh kuvar ayodhya se laai thim
 It was installed in the palace for some time before the Chaturbhuj Temple was built
 lekin mandir banane ke baad koi bhi murti ko uske sthaan se hilaa nahin paaya
 Believing it to be a miracle of God, the palace itself was given the shape of a temple and was named Ram Raja Mandir
 aaj is mahal ke chaaron ore shahar basaa he or ram navami par yahaan hajaaron shraddhalu ikattha hote hai
 By the way, Lord Rama is considered to be Lord here and is also considered the king here, because the face of that idol is not towards the temple but towards the palace

 kaha jaataa he ki badshaah akbar ne abul fazal ko shahjade saleem ko kaabo karne ke liye bheja tha, lekin saleem ne bir singh kii madad se uskaa katl karvaa diya
 Pleased with this, Salim handed over the command of Orchha to Bir Singh

 All the Bundela architectural features like open corridors, stone latticework, animal sculptures, balloons can be seen here

 Stories stemming from the new movements happening here everyday are still on people's tongues
 inhen main se ek he hardaul kii kahani, jo jujhar singh ke rajya kaal kii he
 In fact, due to the conspiracy stories of Mughal spies, this king suspected that his queen had relations with his brother Hardaul
 lihaaja usne rani se hardaul ko zehar dene ko kaha
 To prove himself innocent when the queen could not do so, Hardaul himself drank poison and set a new example of sacrifice
 bundelaon kaa raajkaal 1783 main khatm hone ke saath hi orchha bhi gumnami ke ghaney jangalon main kho gaya or phir yah swatantraaa sangram ke samay surkhiyon main aayaa

 It is the only temple in the entire world where Lord Rama is worshiped as a king
 ramraaja ke ayodhya se orchha aane kii ek manohari katha he
 One day Orchha King Madhukarshah asked his wife Ganeshkunwari to walk to Vrindavan with the intention of worshiping Krishna

 The queen told him her wish

 The queen sent a message to the king that she was coming to Orchha with Ramraja
 raja madhukarshah ne ramraaja ke vigrah ko sthapit karne ke liye karodon kii laagat se chaturbhuj mandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 When the queen reached Orchha, she kept this idol in her palace
 yah nishchit hua ki shubh murut main murti ko chaturbhuj mandir main rakhkar isaki praan pratishtha kii jaaegi
 But this Deity of Rama refused to go to the quadrilateral
 kehete hai ki ram yahaan bal rup main aae or apni maa kaa mahal chhodkar wo mandir main kaise ja sakate the
 Rama still sits in this palace and the quadrangular temple built for him is deserted even today
 yah mandir aaj bhi murti viheen he
 It is also a coincidence that the writing of Ramcharit Manas was also completed on the same day in 1631, when Ramaraja arrived in Orchha
 jo murti orchha main vidyaman he uske bare main bataaya jaataa he ki jab ram vanvaas ja rahe the to unhone apni ek bal murti maa kaushalya ko di thi
 Mother Kaushalya used to offer her child enjoyment
 jab ram ayodhya laute to kaushalya ne yah murti sarayu nadi main visarjeet kar di

 unhone faisla kiya ki unhen apane kharidaaron ko yah samajhane ke liye ki unako unke paison ke badale main ek uchit maatra praapt ho rahi he, maapan kii ek maanak ikai kii jarurat thi
 They agreed to base this measurement more or less on the standard 40-gallon whiskey barrel, but added an additional two gallon volume to ensure that any measurement error would always be in the buyer's favor to win the buyer's trust
 There was an additional method, apparently based on the same principle behind the Bakers design and some other long units of measurement

 agar koi kuan 20% kii pani kii katautee ke saath taral padaarthon kii 10 em bi di maatra kaa utpaadan karata he to kuen ke bare main bhi yah kaha jayega ki yah prati din 8 hazaar bairal kachche kaa utpaadan karata he
 In other circumstances it may be important to include gas in production and consumption figures

 Its production and consumption are referred to as equivalent oil barrels per day
