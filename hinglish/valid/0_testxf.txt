 a university is an institution in which all types of education are imparted high quality education, examinations are conducted and people are awarded academic degrees
 iske antargat vishvavidhyalay ke maidan, bhawan, prabhag, tathaa vidhyaarthiyon kaa sanghathan aadi bhi sammilit hai
 In ancient times there were no universities in the recognized sense in the countries of Europe, although there were many important schools, such as the philosophical schools of Athens, or the schools of literature and customs of Rome, which were higher education institutions
 madhya yug main shiksha par dharmik sansthaaon kaa niyantran rahaa
 Religious institutions arranged schools in which clergy were taught religious, literary and scientific subjects
 is yug main paris kaa dharmik vidhyalay dharmashiksha kaa ek centre ban gaya, tathaa san 1198 tathaa 1215 i
 ke bich paris vishvavidhyalay ke rup main parivartit ho gaya or usamen dharmavigyaan, kala tathaa chikitsa ke prabhag banaae gaye
 Later, expert teachers and students jointly run the university
 12veen shatabdi ke madhya ke aasapaas bolona main kanoon ke vidhyaarthiyon ke prayaas se ek kanoon vishvavidhyalay sthapit kiya gaya
 Around 1250 AD, the word 'university' started being used in a new sense and instead of erudite students, the rulers started establishing political and social needs of their states
 madhyayugin vishvavidhyalay 13veen shatabdi ke madhya ke sarvotkrisht samay main bauddhik swatantraaa kii adwitiya avasthaa ko prakat karte hai
 Their progress was not interrupted due to money and they were able to resist the efforts that destroyed their independent rights

 Medieval philosophy was born into colleges similar to some great religious movements that shook Europe of the Middle Ages and divided its unity
 isi 13veen shatabdi main mahadwipiya europe ke prabhaav se england main bhi oxford or cambridge vishvavidhyalay sthapit ho chuke the
 In Europe there was a definite change in the outlook and expansion of the university with the religion-reform-movement
 unki paramparaagat swavyavastha or swatantraaa lupt ho gai; praachaarya, rajya ke sevak ho gaye; kathor niyantran tathaa jaanch kii vyavastha kii gai
 The university came to be regarded as the institution for initiating workers for the state and related expenses
 ye vishvavidhyalay dharmik sansthaaon se sambandhit hote hue bhi 16veen shatabdi ke dharmik sangharshon se dur rahe
 Universities became centers of scientific discoveries in this century
 baad main 16veen shatabdi main shikshan hi inkaa mukhya kaary ho gaya
 In the 18th century, universities became adapted to the needs of society and tried to teach various subjects which were required for professional training
 france kii kranti ke baad vishvavidhyalayon dwaara rashtriya shiksha kii aayojana hone lagi
 In the 19th century, it was felt that universities should focus on higher education and research and remove secondary education from their minutes
 vaigyanik vishyon ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya gaya
 Universities of this period became not only science but also the center of politics and they did important work by creating permanent sense of nationality in national uplift of different countries
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak vishvavidhyalay kaa sambandh janata ke saath kaaphi ghanishtha ho gaya
 The 20th century saw wide changes in the approach of universities

 Thus gradually the university moved away from the predominantly religious area and became related to the masses
 bharat main vaidic kaal ke gurukulon ko vishvavidhyalay kaa pracheen rup kaha ja saktaa he kyonki unheen main ucch shiksha kii vyavastha thi
 Later, in the Upanishads and Brahmin periods, we find "councils" functioning as universities

 started being taught
 san 1924 i

 The Central Government set up a University Grants Committee to examine the economic condition of universities and to give them appropriate grants for the promotion of higher education
 bhartiya vishvavidhyalay shikshan tathaa sambandhit karanevaale donon prakaar ke hai
 The University Grants Committee lays greater emphasis on the institution's teaching

 Due to the spread of education at the secondary level, the number of students in universities is increasing and the question is whether universities should place all the students who want to study further, or choose only those who are able to benefit from higher education
 The What is the medium of education ?, is also an important question

 In some universities, indiscipline of students is also a problem in schools

 The Bahamas Commonwealth is theoretically a monarchy, and the ruler of the Bahamas is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all of the constitutional powers as his representative, the governor-general of the Bahamas
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " bahamaz kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " bahamaz ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he

 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail

 The time of Maharaja Bhojraj has been accepted by historians from 1010-1055 AD
 atev saraswatikanthabharan kaa rachanakaal isvi gyarahavin shatabdi kaa madhya mana ja saktaa he
 Its pioneer is somewhat predecessor to Mammatt, the author of Kaviprakash

 Both acharyas have given importance to doshava and quality in poetry
 bhojdev kii yah visheshta he ki unhone alankaaron kii upadayeta kanthat: sweekaar kii he tathaa kavy ke liye rasanvit hona aavashyak samajha he
 Thus, Bhojdev's Saraswati Kantha Bharan has influenced Mammat and Vishwanath in part
 saraswatikanthabharan ek dirghakaay granth he jisamen paanch pariched hai
 In the first passage, after giving the definition of poetry general, the author has first discussed the long and virtue of poetry
 isi sandarbh main bhojdev ne pad, vaakya evam vaakyarthgat dosha bataae hai
 The number of defects of each type is sixteen
 bhojdev ke anusaar gun, shabdagat or vaakyarth gat hote hai or prayek ke choubees bhed hai
 At the end of the first passage, certain defects become attributes somewhere
 is kavyatatv ko udhaaharan dwaara samajhaate hue unhone kavyadosha kaa nityanityatv sweekrut kiya he
 In the second passage, while deciding on the phraseology, he first emphasized justification and has given a thoughtful explanation of caste, ritual, attitude, shadow, posture, utterance, tact, bhuniti, hump, bed and readiness
 in baarah tatwon main se reeti ko chhod shesh tatwon kaa vishad vivechan sanskrit ke kisi anya uplabdh sahityagranth main praapt nahin hota
 Banabhatta mentions the bed of special poetic element, but its definition is available only in Saraswati Kantabharana
 tatpashchaat, yamak, shlesh, anupras, chitra, prahelika, gudh evam prashnottar alankaaron ke bhuri bhedopabhedon kaa sodaaharan vivaran diya gaya he
 This part also has the most personal feature of Saraswati Kantabharan
 tadnantar bhojdev kavyavyutpatti ke kaarnon kaa vivechan kar kavy ke teen bhedon ko shravy, drishy evam chitrabhinay ke rup main prastut karte hai
 He has not mentioned Darsuparchakas under visualization, but his division on dance and dance is limited
 tisare pariched main arthanlakaaron ke swaroop evam prakaar bhed kaa vivechan he jo itar saahityachaaryon kii apeksha bhinn swaroop ko liye hue he
 In the fourth passage, there is a discussion of bisexuality, in which the distinction of ornaments of upma etc
 is explained in detail
 antim pariched he - rasvivechan
 In it, the character of Naikadi and the expressions, emotions and experiences have been decided in detail; At the same time, there is also a reference to the form of Kavyapaka, the diverse nightlife
 ant main bharti, kaishiki aadi vrittiyon ke vivechan ke saath granthopasanhaar hota he
 Rasasiddhanta's explanation in Saraswati Kantabharana is often a bird's eye view of the subject
 kavyagat ras gambhir vishay he jisaki garima ke saath purnat: nyaay karne kii drushti se bhoj ne ek shringarprakash naamak swatantra granth kii rachana kar rasvivechan ke adhyay kii purti kii he
 The specialty of Saraswati Kantha Bharan is that it is a broader and derivative text than other literary texts
 iske rachayita bhojdev granthvistaar ke bhay se bhit honevaale nahin hai, udhaaharan de-dekar anek sookshm bhed evam upabhedon ko samajhane kaa sadaa ve udaar prayaas karte hai
 Although the recognition of the discrimination presented by them has not been accepted by the later writers, yet the persistence of disagreeing with their elemental deliberations is also not visible
 is granth par adyopant kisi tikaa kii rachana nahin milti
 On the first three passages, there is a vaccine called Ratneshwar Ramsinghrit Darpan Tika and on the fourth passage, the description of the famous commentator Jagadghar, is not the vaccine for the fifth passage

 Perhaps the pressure on Team Lords also affected Strauss and the rest of the team, as he contributed 2 to the team's score of 190 and did something better in the second innings, scoring 37 of the team's 180 in this lost match, though Strauss did take a punting catch in the first innings
 doosraa test adhik naatakeey sabit hua jisamen strans ne apane lords ke pradarshan main kuch sudhaar kiya or trescothique ke saath pehle wicket ke liye 112 kii saajhedaari bana kar adtalis ran par shen worne kii spin par out ho gaye
 Although this solid start gave England a 99-run lead in the first innings, it was Strauss's frivolous six runs in the second innings that drew more attention, Warne's one legbreak from the rough four balls before the end of the second day's play
 Spinned wonderfully and collided with his body and took a leg stump
 Those six runs are certainly important as England's winning margin was just two runs
 This score of six followed him into the next Test at Old Trafford, making room for Vaughan who scored his first century of the series
 Strauss followed in his captain's footsteps, adding 106 to his side in the second innings and set a target of 371 for Australia, who secured a draw by not letting his last wicket fall and leading the series to a 1–1 draw
 chauthe test main strans ne pehle wicket ke liye shatkeey saajhedaari karke england ko ek acchhee shuruyaat dene main madad kii, gimen unka khud kaa yogadan 35 ran kaa tha tathaa do kaich lekar australia ko 218 tak simit rakhane main sahaayta kii, khaskar teji se ran bana rahe adam gilcrist kaa slip se kaaphi dur kaich pakad kar, jise “garmiyon kii sthai chhavi” kaha gaya
 After giving a follow-on, England got a target of 129 and the batsmen were out under pressure, Strauss kept on till the third wicket fell and won the Test by being one of the four batsmen to score more than twenty and gained the series lead
 
 Only a draw was needed in the final Test to capture the Ashes, Strauss batted almost all day on day one with a winning attitude in which he played seven partners and scored 129 runs and scored another century in the Ashes series for both teams
 Became the only player to score two centuries

 When there was only a few days remaining in the series, England had to bat again and unfortunately Strauss could not sustain his brilliant performance, he was again dismissed by Warne when he was caught by Simon Katich for just one run
 Grabbed is sab ke baavjood, dakshin africa main hi janme england ke saathi khilaadi kevin peterson ne apana pehla shatak thok kar australia ko jeetne se roak diya or england ne 18 varshon main pehali baar shrinkhalaa jeet kar ashes par kabja kar liya
 Bowling was arguably more effective than batting in a series, Strauss batting average was 39
30 while he was only the fourth highest run-scorer in England with 393 runs, only one batsman from Australia, Justin Langer, scored more than that
 One run; Strauss was the only player to score two centuries and hold six catches, making him the second best fielder after England's Ian Bell

 In the following winter months, England toured Pakistan with the aim of advancing the undisputed series of six series since 2004 following the success of their Ashes

 Acknowledging Strauss's batting problems, Strauss's performance could never improve because before England's final defeat, before leaving Pakistan to join at the birth of their first child, the first two Tests, the first losing and In the second draw, he scored just 44 runs at an average of 11

 He also scored 26 runs in the low-scoring final match, which was won by England, but also wore zero glasses in the first two matches

 Cook repeated Strauss's initial theatrical performance when he scored a half-century and a century, fading Strauss's 28 and 36 in the drawn match
 Strauss shone once again without Cook in front in the third Test and scored 128 runs in a winning effort to level the series

 Strauss's double-digit score was 61 in the second match, but as Flintoff wanted a break from captaincy, the captaincy was handed over to Strauss in the fifth match, a match that was canceled due to violence by a crowd of spectators in Guwahati
 agle oriai main flintoff ko barahawein khilaadi ke rup main lekar strans ne pehle bharat se ballebaaji karwaai, phir ian bel ke saath shatkeey saajhedaari karke, jisamen mansapeshiyon main khinchaav ke kaaran ritair hone ke samay unka yogadan 74 kaa tha, aath over shesh rahete shandaar jeet england kii is daure kii ekmaatr ek divasiy safalataa thi kyonki antim match main bharat ne 5 gend shesh rahete hue hi safaltaapurvak lakshya kii peechha kar liya tha, isamen strans kaa yogadan sirf 25 ran kaa tha
 After the euphoria of the last two years, England returned home exhausted throughout the century without a series victory, the rule of the subcontinental trio was completed as it reached Sri Lanka when it proved that Asian domination was not limited to the Indian subcontinent
 captaini kaa taj flintoff ko lautaa kar strans ne keval maidan par apane ballebaaji kaushal par dhyaan kendrit kiya jisane use prasiddh kar diya
 Starting the innings once again with Trescothick, Strauss became the victim of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling just before half-century at lunch, followed by Cook and the remaining players

 Strauss had scored the second highest number of runs in both England innings before being controversially dismissed from the pad for 16 in the second Test
 tisare test match main unhone ek or ardhshtak darj kiya, haalanki yah 134 ran se haar ko rokane ke liye paryaapt nahin tha
 Once again Strauss was offered the captaincy for the short form of the game, leading the England team in a tense two-match losing match to Sri Lanka, where he formed a 59-run opening partnership with Trescothick
 strans kii captaini main england ko paanch maichon main dhulaai sahan kerani padi, jahaan strans 50 ran bhi nahin juta sake, haalanki yah sweekaar kiya gaya ki team, visheshkar team kaa gendbaaji paksh kamjor tha
 When England began their busy international schedule from the Ashes to the World Cup, despite being washed out for one day, Strauss was made the formal captain in place of caretaker for the summer tour of Pakistan, looking at Test captaincy
 The first match took place at his favorite Lord's ground in which he recorded another century, this time in 128 second innings
 Which their bowlers came under criticism for the fact that he won were only 80 overs, which they did not achieve
 In the second Test, he made a drastic change in the situation with an agile fielding that limited Pakistan to under 250 in both innings and contributed to England's fast-paced 461 score of 42, allowing him an innings in just three days
 Won impressive victory

 The first Test series, under Strauss's captaincy, ended with some controversy at the Oval, it was named the Ovalgate by commentators, umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove inspected the ball during the second innings and decided that the ball was tampered with was

 The series thus ended 3–0 in favor of England, with Strauss being named the best player of the series after Mohammed Yunus scoring the most runs for England

 He could not do well in the only Twenty20 International, was dismissed for zero and Pakistan won the match with two overs of atrophy, and when the one-day series started, his fate remained the same

 After missing the first two Tests, questions began to arise about the divided dressing room, as captaincy was repeatedly transferred between Strauss and Flintoff, but Strauss did not attach importance to these allegations

 Strauss secured the only recognition of his tour in the Boxing Day Test when he scored 50 runs, though he would remember it more as Shane Warne's 700th Test victim, the Australian spinner until the final Test of his life, ashes He had lost his hand, before it was taken in the match

 After the series, Test team coach Duncan Fletcher regretted the lack of confidence in both Strauss and Paul Collingwood, whom he wanted to encourage as a role model for the rest of the team

 Although England have a tendency to do better in the longer run than in the shorter format of the game, they gained momentum after the initial defeats and defeated New Zealand, as it would be if they lost at the group level but won in the end
 He is the winner, Strauss's only notable score being 55 runs
 is samay tak, flechar ke yah sweekaar karne ke saath hi ki unhen uthle ballebaaji vikalpon ke kaaran hi adhiktar team main liya gaya tha, ek divasiy main strans kii kharaab farm ujagar ho chuki thi
 However, the s fifties did nothing to their confidence as they were bowled out for zero in the first final and six in the second, although they kept both Ponting and Mike Hussey to a score of unit points, keeping duckworth-lewis impressed
 Could be used to win England so that the third match is not needed
 Due to his poor performance, he had to stay out of the team till the group level of the World Cup and had to wait until the commentators were called to play against arch-rivals Australia despite his hopes of a comeback against Sri Lanka in the Super Eight, where he Only 7 runs were scored and his appeal to run out was rejected after TV replays
 jab tak england nock out main baahar na ho gaya tab tak ve shesh sabhi maichon main england kii ore se khele; agle do varsh tak phir se ve england ke liye ek divasiy cricket main nahin khele

 Strauss then announced that he was, as he described, retiring from cricket after "a long, tiring and extremely disappointing 12 months"
 haalanki, ve team ke liye byaap ke rup main bharat kii yatra ke liye sakasham the, yadi ve aisa chaahate
 Strauss was thus eliminated from cricket matches in England's winter

 Despite the fact that he had not scored a single century from 25 Test innings so far, Strauss was selected to play in the second warm-up match over Owais Shah, sparking speculation that he would miss the first Test against New Zealand
 You will get a place in the match team
 Strauss was placed in the third order batting, leaving Vaughan and Cook to open as was done against Sri Lanka

 However in the second innings he returned to the place of opener and scored an unbeaten 104 with Ian Bell

 In the second innings, however, he scored his slowest but his first century since August 2006, off 226 balls and went on to score his highest Test cricket score of 177

 Neutrino This is a new particle which was first invented by Pauli in 1930
 is kan kaa pratham saidhantik aadhaar prasiddh bhautikeevid fermi ne san 1934 main batalaaya
 The properties of neutrinos are summarized as follows: un abhikriyaaon kii, jinase beta kirane milti he, jaanch karte samay yah dekha gaya ki nikle hue kanon kaa urja varnakram elfaa kiran ke urja varnakram se bhinn he
 Alpha rays meet in a different line spectrum, but beta rays emulate a completely different type of spectral spectrum
 radium-i ke liye praapt beta kiran kaa urja varnakram chitra main dikhaaya gaya he
 The energy of beta rays can be any value between zero and maximum value ea
 aisa hi santat varnakram un abhikriyaaon main bhi miltaa he jinase pozitron praapt hote hai
 Stabilizing the theoretical basis of the spectral spectrum given by beta rays remained a difficult problem for a long time
 maan liya jaay ki kisi nabhik k se, jo ek vishesh urja ke tal par he, ek beta kiran nikalati he or is abhikraya dwaara ek doosraa nabhik kha banataa he, jo pun: ek vishesh urja ke tal par he
 According to the theory of Puja and energy stability: the energy of the emitted beta particle should be equal to the difference between the energy cells of nucleus a and B
 yah urja siddhant sarvada E=mc2 ke tulya praapt hoti he
 From the test, particles emit energy of all values from zero to e = mc2
 aisa prathit haata he ki aisi abhikriyaaon main urja kaa kuch ansh lupt ho jaataa he or punj evam urja sthirataa ke siddhant kaa atikaraman hota he
 Fermi first successfully solved this problem by giving his neutrino subconception after beta rays
 unhone yah suzav diya ki beta kiran dene vaali abhikriyaaon main ek or kan nutrino bhi praapt hota he or vahi lupt prathit hone vaali urja ko grahan kar letaa he
 Till date, the neutrino has not been identified by examination, consequently its properties should be such that its identification is very difficult
 isaliye yah dharna kii gai ki nutrino aavesh rahit he or iskaa bhaar electron kii tulana main atinune he, shunaya ke hi lagbhag he
 Neutrino's charge is in accordance with the principle of charge for the reaction of a beta ray
 nutrino pariklpana ke anusaar, beta kiran abhikriya main praapt hui urja kii maatra ir a he
 This energy is received by the beta particles neutrinos and the rebound nucleus
 teen kanon main urja vibhaajan anekanek bhanti ho saktaa he, isaliye santat varnakram ban jaataa he
 When a beta ray is received from a nucleus, then the charge of the nucleus changes by unit, then the charge of the nucleus changes by unit, the weight remains unchanged
 yadi ek electron praapt ho, to nabhik ke proton kii sankhya main ikai kii vruddhi hoti he tathaa clebanu ikai dwaara sankhya ikai dwaara kam ho jaati he
 In the same way if a positron is obtained in a beta ray reaction, then the proton number decreases by unit and the cleban number increases by unit
 in beta roopantaron ko nimnlikhit dhang se spasht kiya ja saktaa he: In these reactions, neutrons are not considered to be made up of protons, electrons and neutrinos
 beta-utsarjan ke samay, neutron kaa teen kanon main tatkshan parivartan ho jaataa he
 a similar withdrawal occurs in protons in beta + emission
 evam samikarnon dwaara nutrino ke anya gunon ke bare main bhi soochna milti he
 Only when the angular capacity h / 2 is assumed does the law of its stability occur exactly
 usee bhanti, sankhyikee ke bare main bhi soochna milti he
 If the stability of the statistic is seen in the equation and this rule is true only if the neutrino follows the fermi-dirac statistic
 meson ke apkshay kii samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye bhi nutrino pariklpana kaa prayog kiya gaya
 Like a beta-ray reaction, the laws of heat and energy stability are broken when a mu-meson is converted into an electron
 in niyamon kii satyata ke liye nimnlikhit vidhi batalaai gai : Similarly, alpha-meson weathering can be shown by the following equation
 evam samikarnon ke viruddh koi samparikshawya sakshya nahin he In this way, the problems of beta rays and mesons have been resolved by neutrinos
 is kan ke liye sabhi sakshya abhi tak apratyaksh hi hai

 Under the leadership of Mr
 Vegesna, the company has earned a maiden profit after 10 years of its inception
 As of March 31st 2006, it has 171 points of presence serving more than 250 cities in the country
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, antarrashtriya simaaon yaa kshetron ke aar-paar puunji, maal or sevaaon kaa aadan-pradaan he
 
 In most countries, it represents a significant fraction of GDP
 jabaki antarrashtriya vyapaar, itihaas ke adhikansh bhaag main maujuud rahaa he iskaa aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik mahatv haal kii sadiyon main badhane laga he
 Industrialization, advanced transport, globalization, multinational corporations and outsourcing have all had a wide impact on the international trade system
 vaishvikaran kii nirantarata ke liye antarrashtriya vyapaar main badhotaree mahatvapurn he
 Without international trade, countries will be limited to goods and services produced within their own borders
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, siddhant rup main gharelu vyapaar se bhinn nahin he kyonki ek vyapaar main shaamil pakshon kii abhiprerana or vyavhaar moulik rup se badalata nahin he bhale hi vyapaar seemaa paar kaa ho yaa nahin
 The main difference is that international trade is generally more expensive than domestic trade
 iskaa kaaran he ki ek seemaa aam taur par atirikt shulk lagaati he jaise prashulk, seemaa par vilamb ke kaaran aavadhik laagat or bhashaa, kanoonee pranali yaa samskruti jaise deshiy bhinnataaon se judi laagtein
 Another difference between domestic and international trade is that production factors such as capital and labor are generally more dynamic within countries than outside
 is prakaar antarrashtriya vyapaar zyaadaatar maal or sevaaon ke vyapaar tak simit he or puunji, shram yaa utpaadan ke anya karkon ke vyapaar main keval ek chote paimaane par
 iske alaava maal or sevaaon kaa vyapaar, utpaadan karkon main vyapaar ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main kaary kar saktaa he
 Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of the factor of production and thus include the related factor
 An example is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China
 Rather than importing Chinese labor, the US is importing goods from China that are produced using Chinese labor
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, arthshaastra kii ek shakha bhi he, jo antarrashtriya vitt ke saath milakar antarrashtriya arthshaastra kii vistrut shakha kaa nirmaan karti he
 Several different models have been proposed to forecast the methodology of trade and to analyze the impact of trade policies such as tariffs
 ricardian model tulanaatmak laabh par kendrit he or antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main shaayad sabase mahatvapurn avadharana he
 In a Ricardian model, countries specialize in the production of the things they produce well
 anya modelon ke vipareet, ricardian dhaancha purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, maal kii ek vistrut shrunkhlaa kaa utpaadan karne ke bajaay visheshgy honge
 In addition, the Ricardian model does not directly consider factor funds, such as the relative amount of labor and capital within a country
 The major advantage of the Ricardin model is that it visualizes technology variations between countries
 praudyogiki antar, ricardian or ricardo-srapha model main aasaani se shaamil hota he 
 The Ricardian model makes the following assumptions: ricardian model laghu-avadhi main maapan karata he, isliye praudyogiki antarrashtriya str par bhinn hoti he
 This supports the fact that countries follow their comparative advantage and allow for specialization
 ricardian vyapaar model kaa adhyayan graham, jones, mekenzi or anya dwaara kiya gaya
 All principles excluded trade input goods such as intermediate goods, commodities and capital goods
 mekenji, jones or samuelson ne jor diya ki vyapaar se madhyavarti vastuon ko baahar rakhe jane se kaaphi laabh kho jayega
 ek prasiddh tippanee main mekenji ne kaha ki "ek pal kaa vichaar ek vyakti ko samajha degaa ki sooti kapade kaa utpaadan karne ke liye lankashair asambhavy hoga, yadi kapaas ko england main ugaana pade
 More recently, it expanded the theory to include the business intermediate case as well
 is prakaar "keval shram" dharna siddhant se nikaal di gai
 Thus the new Ricardian theory, sometimes named the ricardo-sraffa model, theoretically includes capital goods such as machines and materials, traded between countries
 vaishvik vyapaar ke samay main, yah dharna heksher-olin model kii apeksha adhik yathartwaadee he, jo yah maanata he ki puunji, desh ke andar sthir he or antarrashtriya str par gatisheel nahin he
 In the early 1900s, two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Olin, created an international trade theory called the factor ratio theory
 is siddhant ko heksher-olin siddhant bhi kaha jaataa he
 The heckscher-olin theory emphasizes that countries should produce and export goods that require resources that are abundant and must import goods that require short-supply resources
 yah siddhant, tulanaatmak laabh or purna laabh ke siddhanton se bhinn he kyonki ye siddhant ek vishesh vastu ke liye utpaadan prakriya kii utpaadakta par kendrit hai
 In contrast, the heckscher-olin theory states that a country should specialize in production and export using factors that are most abundant and therefore cheap
 Do not produce those goods, as stated by earlier theories, which they produce most efficiently
 heksher-olin model ko buniyadi tulanaatmak laabh ke ricardian model ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Despite its greater complexity, it did not prove to be more accurate in its forecasts
 lekin ek saidhantik drushtikon se dekhne par yah antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main nav-shastreey mulya tantra ko shaamil karke ek suruchipurna samaadhaan pradaan karata he
 This theory argues that the pattern of international trade is determined by differences in factor funds
 yah purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, un maalon kaa niryaat karenge, jo sthaneey rup se prachur karkon kaa upyog karte hai or un maalon kaa aayaat karenge, jo aise karkon kaa upyog karte hai jo sthaneey rup se atyant alp hai
 Empirical problems with the HO model, known as the Leontief paradox, were encountered in empirical tests by Vasily Leontief, who found that the US was exporting labor-intensive goods despite the abundance of capital
 H-O model nimnlikhit mukhya dharanaen banaata he: The problem with HO theory is that it does not involve the trade of capital goods
 In HO theory, labor and capital are constant substances for each country
 ek aadhunik arthvyavastha main, puunjigat vastuon kaa antarrashtriya str par kaarobaar kiya jaataa he
 Trade in intermediate goods benefits greatly, as emphasized by Samuelson
 kai arthshaastri ricardo siddhant kii tulana main heksher-olin siddhant ko pasand karte hai, kyonki yah kam saral dharanaon ko banaata he
 In 1953, Vecily Leontief published a study where he tested the validity of the heckscher-olin theory
 The study showed that the US was more abundant in capital than other countries, so the US was exporting capital-intensive goods and importing labor-intensive goods
 Leontief found that US exports were less capital-intensive than imports
 leontiff virodhabhas ke ubharne ke baad, kai shodhakartaaon ne heksher-olin siddhant ko bachaane kii koshish kii, yaa to maapan ke nae tareekon dwaara, yaa nai vyakhyaaon ke dwaara
 limar ne bal diya ki leontiff ne H-O siddhant kii sahi vyakhya nahin kii or daawa kiya ki ek sahi vyakhya ke saath virodhabhas ghatit nahin hua
 Brecher and Choudary found that, if Leamer was right, the per capita consumption of American workers should be lower than the world average of workers' consumption
 baad main kai anya pareekshan hue lekin unamem se zyaadaatar asafal rahe
 Many well-known textbook authors, including Krugman and Obstfeld and Bowen, Hollander, and VN, are negative about the validity of the HO model
 
 anubhavjanya anusandhan ke lambey itihaas kaa pareekshan karne ke baad, boven, holender or vien ne nishkarsh diya: "kaarak bahutayat siddhant ke haal ke pareekshan jo sidhe HOV samikarnon kii jaanch karte hai, ve siddhant kii asweekruti kaa bhi sanket dete hai"
 :321 The Heckscher – Olin theory has not been well adapted to analyze south – north trade problems
 HO ke anumaan, N-N vyapaar kii tulana main N-S ke sambandh main kam yathartwaadee hai
 The income difference between North and South is the one thing the Third World cares the most
 kaarak mulya samakaran ne vasuuli kaa adhik sanket nahin dikhaaya he
 The HO model assumes that similar production functions between countries
 yah behad avastavik he
 Differentiation of technology between developed and developing countries is a major concern for poor countries
 is model main, udyogon ke bich shram gatishiltaa sambhav he, jabaki alpavadhi main udyogon ke bich puunji sthir he
 Thus, this model can be interpreted as a 'short-term' version of the Heckscher – Olin model
 vishisht kaarak naam, pradaan kiye jane vaale ke liye yah sandarbhit karata he ki alpavadhi main, bhautik puunji jaise utpaadan ke vishisht kaarak udyogon ke bich aasaani se antarneey nahin hai
 The theory suggests that if there is an increase in the price of the goods, then the owners of the factor of production in the specific context of that goods will have real good advantage
 iske alaava, virdohi utpaadan ke vishisht karkon ke maalikon ke paas virdohi kaarysoochee hone kii sambhaavna hoti jab ve shram ke apravas par niyantran ke liye paksh jutate hai
 In contrast, owners of both capital and labor benefit realistically from the increase in capital funds
 yah model vishesh udyogon ke liye adarsh he
 This model is ideal for understanding income distribution but is naïve to discuss the method of trade
 naveen vyapaar siddhant, vyapaar ke bare main kai tathyon ko samajhane kii koshish karata he, jo upar ullikhit do mukhya modelon ke liye mushkil he
 It also includes the fact that most trade occurs between countries with similar factor endowment and productivity levels and the large amount of multinational production that exists

 kai sadiyon tak vanikwaad main vishwaas ke tahat adhikansh deshon main antarrashtriya vyapaar par seemaa shulk ucch tha or kai pratibandh the
 In the 19th century, especially in the United Kingdom, trust in free trade became paramount
 uske baad se yah dharna pashchimi deshon ke bich prabhavi soch ban gai
 In the years following World War II, controversial multilateral treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization attempted to promote free trade by creating a globally regulated trade framework
 in vyapaar samjhauton ne, anuchit vyapaar ke daavon ke saath jo vikasshil deshon ke liye laabhadaayak nahin hai, aksar virodh or asantosh ko janm diya he
 Free trade is generally the most favored by the most economically strong countries, although they often engage in selective protectionism for industries that are strategically important, such as the US and Europe's imposition of agriculture
 a protective tariff
 The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were staunch advocates of free trade at the time when they were financially influential, today the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan being its biggest supporters
 haalanki, kai anya desh tezi se mukt vyapaar ke himachati banate ja rahe hai kyonki ve aarthik rup se khud adhik shaktishaalee ban rahe hai
 As the tariff level is declining, the desire to discuss non-tariff measures is also increasing, including foreign direct investment, recovery and trade facilitation
 Trade facilitation takes into account customs procedures and transaction costs related to carrying out trade

 During a recession, there is often excessive domestic pressure to increase tariffs to protect domestic industries

 Previous articles have discussed how international businesses need supporting ecosystems and business-friendly policies if they are to succeed in emerging markets
 vishesh mahatv tay he ki ve seoup unke sanchaalan ke liye antarrashtriya kaarobaar kii anumati dene or unhen aage badhane or safal hone ke liye protsaahit karegaa main sarkaron kii bhoomika he
 Often, there is not an option for governments of many countries but they are also known as welcoming international businesses as they need "cash" or dollars
 udhaaharan ke liye, niryaat or aayaat ke bich ke antar ko chaalu khate ke ghate yaa siedi ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Since many emerging markets, the deficit is the ones that need funding with the dollar
 phir, sarkaron ucch daron par in dollar udhaar lene yaa pratyaksh videshi nivesh yaa videshi pratyaksh nivesh or equity ke madhyam se ghaataa vitt exai yaa videshi sansthagat niveshkon se share bazaaron main bahati kar sakate hai
 In addition, domestic industry capabilities may not be a particular area nor the expertise to be successful in developing that field
 isliye, epadiai ki kshetra ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 In addition, the opening of the economy is necessary for entry into the World Trade Organization or World Trade Organization, which means that in order to export to other countries, to open in emerging markets and developing economies
 in vajahon se vikasshil deshon main kai sarkarein apane-apane deshon main seoup ke sanchaalan ke liye antarrashtriya kaarobaar main videshi nivesh ko protsaahit karne or anumati dene ke kuch kar rahe hai
 However, a host of factors that do not continue the policies of the same governments include the ideological balance of governments, the compulsions of politics, and the fact that foreign investment may not succeed in kick-starting as a planned economy
 it depends on
 yahaan mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon ke kai sarkarein aksar kyonki uparokt kaarnon kaa khuli bahon se antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat he
 However, through the intervening process, some of them develop cold feet due to policy paralysis, and the factors listed above
 yah samajha ja saktaa he ki antarrashtriya kaarobaar ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon main pravesh karne kii ijaajat di dwidaleey arth he ki vahaan sabhi hitdharakon se is mudde par vyapak sahmati hona chahie hona chahie kii jarurat he
 Only then will international business succeed in emerging market economies
 iske alaava, videshi puunji ke liye pratispardhaa he ki kisi main prakriya par pratikul arthvyavastha or isliye, is prakriya ko jari rakhaa janaa chahie or kaaran protsaahan diya antarrashtriya kaarobaar ko prabhavit karte hai itani teevr he
 Finally, examples from China, Brazil, South Africa, and Vietnam demonstrate the need for a consensus on the opening of economies and following through on this process
 duusari ore, bharat or rus ke udhaaharan ke anya tareeke se in deshon khuli bahon ke saath majaburiyon ke kaaran unki arthvyavasthaaon ko kholaa or phir lekin gati ko banaae rakhane ke rup main asafal aasapaas hai
 This means that integration in the global economy will only take place when the process of reforms is stopped wholeheartedly or without a U-turn
