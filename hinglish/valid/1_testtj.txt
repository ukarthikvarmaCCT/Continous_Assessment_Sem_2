baad main likhi gayi naak tathaa overkot jaisi kahaniyon ko milakar in sab kahaniyon ko petersburg kii kahaniyaan ke naam se abhihit kiya gaya
 Gogol's folklore has been quite extensive in these stories

 The poignant portrayal of life's anomalies and irony through humor and subtle satire is amazing in these compositions
 hansee ke vaataavaran main maarak chot ke madhyam se swatah udbhoot samaadhaan ke sanket gogol kii kala ko vishisht banaate hai
 It is for these reasons that Belinsky called Gogol's satire 'laughter among tears'

 In 1835–36, there was an intimacy between Gogol and Pushkin
 pushkin dwaara prakashit patr 'samakaleen' main gogol sahyog dene laga
 The theme of his famous compositions 'the Government Inspector' and 'the Dead Souls' was received from Pushkin itself
 'inspector' ke bare main gogol ne swayan sweekaar kiya he ki usamen maine rus kii sari buraaiyon ko, jinase ki main avgat hum, ek jagah ekatrit karne kaa nishchay kiya he, tathaa un saare anyaayon ko, jo ki un jagahon or sthitiyon main kaye jate hai, jahaan manushya se sabase adhik nyaay kii maang kii jaati he, or in sab par ek saath hansane kaa nishchay kiya he
 People of progressive ideology were pleased with the performance of this comedy, but the reactionaries were very angry and demanded to seize the play by calling it an unrestrained attack on the employees
 in baton se gogol kaaphi pareshaan hua tathaa uskaa swasthya bhi kharaab ho gaya
 In such a situation, Gogol went on a foreign trip in 1836 to get some peace and pay attention to the writing of 'dead souls'
 kuch samay tak paris main rahane ke baad vah rome main bas gaya tha or prakaashan-kaary hetu hi kabhi-kabhi rus aata tha
 The first part of dead souls was completed in 1841
 kaaphi kathinaayee ke baad iskaa prakaashan ho paaya
 This creation made Gogol immortal

 By presenting a nude portrait of the Russian life of the then era, Geranson called the dead souls a scream of tragedy and shame, and Belinsky considered it the most important literary work of that era

 There are many forms of this dance among North East Indian groups, for example "deori Bihu Dance", "mising Bihu Dance" etc
, although the basic goal of the dance remains the same: expressing the desire to feel both pain and pleasure

 The michelson-morley experiment is an 1887 experiment by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley
 kai baar ise mikelson morle vyatikaranmaapi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The result of this experiment proved the ether theory to be untrue
 is prayog ne paramparaagat raste se hatakar us raste par kadam badhaayaa jo vaigyanik samaaj ko 'dwitiya vaigyanik kranti' kii disha main le gaya
 There are three experiments that perform fundamental tests of specific relativity - the Michelson Morley experiment, the Ives – Istivel experiment and the Kennedy – Thorndike experiment
 san 1887 main e0 e0 micelson or i0 dablyoo0 morly ne milakar ether main gumti hui prithvi kaa veg gyaat karne kaa prayaas is purvanumaan par kiya ki prithvi ke veg kaa prabhaav prakaash ke veg par padataa he
 But Michelson and Morley failed to find any effect of the velocity of the Earth on the velocity of light
 in dono vaigyanikon kii asafalataa hi oinstin ke aapekshikta siddhant kii janmdatri he
 This experiment was repeated again and again as it was important for relativity theory
 is prayog main micelson ne swanirmit vyatikaranmaapi kaa upyog kiya tha kii ore jaataa he or shesh 50 pratishat prakaash pargamit hokar sidhaa tisare darpan c darpan par aaptit hota he
 These two mirrors c are perpendicular to each other
 prakaash ke ye do kiranpunj kramash: donon c darpanon se paravartit hokar pun: b darpan par aaptit hoti he or prekshak in donon kirnon ke dwaara vyatikaran kii dhariyon ko ek saath dekh saktaa he
 If both c mirrors are equally spaced from B, then the central stripe is bright in these stripes
 b darpan se donon c darpanon kii duuri main bahut thodaa antar bhi ho to in do prakashakirnon main se ek ko pahunchne main usee ke anupaat main thodaa vilamb hoga or kendriya dhari swalp maatra main vichlit hogi
 By measuring the location deviation of the central stripe, the difference in the time span of these two rays can be detected
 b se C1 or C1 ke antar yadhyapi thik-thik baraabar hon, kintu maan len kisi kaaran BC1 or BC2 paraspar abhilamb dishaao main prakaash kaa veg bhinn hota ho, to bhi kendriya dhari visthapit hogi or is visthaapan kaa maapan kar in do dishaao main prakaash ke veg gyaat kiye ja sakate hai
 According to the ether hypothesis, it should be natural and necessary for the velocity of light to vary in these two normal directions
 newtoneey antariksh ek swatantra satta he or usamen ether bharaa hua he
 This ether is stable
 jab prithvi is sthir ether main surya kii parikrama karti he, tab 'etherwat' utpann hoga
 We would imagine that the 'etherwat' is in BC2 direction and its velocity is
 yah veg vastut: keval prithvi kii saura parikrama kaa hi veg nahin rahegaa kintu prithvi kii saura parikrama kaa veg, saura mandal kaa veg, akashganga kaa veg ityadi sarvasambhavya vegon kaa parinami veg hoga
 The first transmission of the light in BC2 direction will be from the velocity of transmission and the velocity of return, where is the velocity of light
 BC1 disha 'etherwat' se abhilamb he
 The Michelson – Morley experiment did not cause displacement of the central stripe
 yah sambhav he ki 'etherwat' jaisaa BC2 disha main samajha gaya vaisaa nahin hoga, kintu kisi anya disha main hoga
 This doubt was also canceled in this experiment
 micelson-morly prayog main vyatikaranmaapi ek shila par dridhtaa se sthapit tha, jiskaa prishth 150 senmido or motaai 30 semi0 thi 
 This rock was filled with mercury in an iron circular hull and the rock could float in the mercury with an interferometer
 vyatikaranmaapi ko is prakaar tairta rakhane se do laabh the : ek to companon se hone vaala updrav nasht ho gaya or doosraa, prayog karte samay vyatikaranmaapi ko purnat: ghumana sambhav hua
 Thus, at any given moment while rotating the interferometer, the BC2 direction will be in the direction of 'etherwat' and the BC1 direction will be normal
 at: prekshan karte samay vyatikaranmaapi ko ghurnan diya jaae to kendriya dhari kaa visthaapan kramash: kam athwa adhik hota rahegaa, athwa duusare shabdon main kendriya dhari kaa vishisht antar main dolan hota rahegaa
 To make the experiment more sensitive, the paths of light were increased, for which the reflections were repeatedly reflected from the mirrors prior to interference
 aavashyak sudhaar tathaa saavdhaaniyaan rakhane par bhi kendriya dhari kaa visthaapan nahin hua or jo kuch atyant swalp maatra kaa vichlan praapt hua vah praayogic truti ke antargat tha
 Therefore, the existence of 'etherwat' was not proven
 micelson-morly prayog kii shrunkhlaa ke parinaamon ko sankshep main is tarah kah sakate hai ki ether main gumti hui prithvi kaa veg prakaash ke veg par koi prabhaav nahin daalata he, at: prakaash ke veg kii sahaayta se prithvi kaa veg nahin gyaat kiya ja saktaa
 Endoscope means looking inside, and especially it means looking inside the body with the help of endoscope for medical reasons
 endoscope ek aisa upkaran he, jiskaa prayog sharir ke khokhale ang athwa chhidron ke andar jaanch karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Unlike other medical imaging devices, the endoscope is inserted directly into the body part
 endoscopy, aisi takneekee paristhitiyon, jinamein pratyaksh drushti-rekha avlokan vyaavhaarik na ho, main borescope ke prayog ko bhi ullekith kar sakati he
 An endoscope may consist of the following components: endoscopy ke antargat shaamil ho sakate hai: The first endoscope was invented in 1806 by Philippe Bozzini with the development of the "lichtliter" introduced by him to examine the tubes and troughs of the human body

 unka iraadaa aisa upkaran viksit karne kaa tha, jisaki madad se chikitsak maanav sharir ke andar dekh sakane main safal ho sake
 The technology available at the end of World War II was still very simple

 karl stores ne ek yojana ko apanaaya: unhone sharir ke andar upkaran ke jariye bahut hi chamakili, lekin thandi, roshni daalane kaa prayaas kiya, jisase sharir ke andar behtareen drishyata praapt ho or saath hi chitra prasaaran ke jariye vastunishth dastavejikaran sambhav ho sake
 Karl Storge played an important role towards the development of endoscopy, with over 400 patients and functional samples as guides for the coming time
 haalanki ve harold hopkins the jinhone apni ejineering pratibha or drushti ke saath-saath optical diziner ke kaary dwaara medical optics ke kshetra main aakhirkaar kranti paidaa kar di

 In the early 1950s Harold Hopkins produced a "fibroscope", which proved useful in both the medical and industry sectors
 in fibron par hone vaale baad ke shodh or vikaas se chitra kii gunvattta main or bhi sudhaar aae
 In the days to come, the use of additional fibers to bring light from a powerful external source to the ends of the object was included in the new development - allowing for a higher level of full spectral brightness, which was needed to see the nuances of the image and color photography
 Is meant for
 optical kshetra main hone vaale vikaas ke saath hi yah kshamta viksit hui, jisamen endoscopist ke haathon main sthit niyantran dwaara tip ko “sanchalit” karnaa sambhav hua or saath hi endoscope ke andar lage shalya-chikitsa upkaran ko remote ke jariye sanchalit karne kii disha main bhi nai suvidhaayen hasil huin
 This was the beginning of the surgery that we know today as key hole surgery
 portugal ke fernando alwes martins ne pratham fibre optics endoscope kaa avishkaar kiya 
 However, the picture quality of the fibroscope had physical limitations
 aadhunik shabdaawalee main 50,000 fibre kaa ek bandal prabhaavshaalee rup main keval 50,000 picksal kaa chitra hi detaa he, iske alaava istemaal main lagaataar parivartan ke kaaran fibre tuutate hai or is prakaar dhire-dhire picksal kam ho jate hai
 Eventually enough damage occurs that the entire bundle needs to be replaced
 hopkins ne mahasoos kiya ki kisi agle optical sudhaar ke liye ek alag vidhi kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Earlier strict endoscopes had very low light transmittance and poor image quality
 sargical kaaryon ke liye shalya-chikitsa ke aujaaron or ilumination system ko endoscope tub se hokar gujaarne kii aavashyaktaa ke kaaran imaging optics ke liye koi khaas gunjaaish nahin thi
 The smaller lens of the traditional system required an auxiliary ring, which acquired a larger portion of the lens; These were quite difficult to construct and put together, as well as optically failing
 hopkins ne jo parishkrut nidaan prastut kiya, vah tha ‘little lens’ ke bich ke sthaan ko glass rod se bhar dena
 These fit precisely into the endoscope tube, making them self-concentrating and requiring no support to fully distribute the 'little lens'
 rod-lens ko sanchalit or istemaal karnaa kaaphi aasaan tha or isane adhiktam uplabdh vyas kaa upyog kiya
 The quality of the image was converted into a 1 mm diameter tube with the correct curvature, coating at the ends of the rod and maximum choices of glass type, as assessed and mentioned by Hopkins
 aise chote vyas vaale ucch gunvattta yukt ‘telescope’ ke saath tul tathaa iluminesh system ko aasaani se ek bahari tub ke bheetar rakhaa ja sakaa
 Karl Storge once again created these new endoscopes first in the form of a long creative collaboration between two individuals

 The Encyclopédie was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772
 iskaa puraa naam Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers tha
 The encyclopaedia was new in many respects
 yah pehla vishwakosh tha jisamen bahut se namit yogakartaaon ke lekh sammilit kiye gayi the
 It was the first general encyclopedia that paid attention to the 'mechanical arts'
 kintu in sab baton se pare inacychlopidi isliye bhi prasiddh he ki isane kii gyanoday kaa vichaar prastut kiya
 Denis Didero wrote in an article called 'encyclopédie' that its purpose is to change the way people think
 uski ichha thi ki vishwa ke saare gyaan ko inacychlopidi main samet diya jaay or vartmaan tathaa bhavi pidiyon main yah gyaan fail jaay
 Its work began as a French translation of "chambers Cyclopaedia" by the English scholar John Mills in his French residence, which he finished in 1745 with the help of Mottfi Sales
 par vah ise prakashit na kar sakaa or england waapas chalaa gaya
 Services of several scholars were obtained one by one for its editing and after many struggles this encyclopedia was published
 inacychlopidi atharahavin shatee kii mahattam saahitiyik uplabdhi he
 This was not a mere reference book; It also provided instructions
 yah aasthaa or anasthaa kaa vicitra sangam tha
 It attacked the most powerful church and government of that era
 sambhavat: anya koi aisa vishwakosh nahin he, jise itnaa raajnneetik mahatv praapt ho or jisane kisi desh ke itihaas or sahitya par krantikari prabhaav daalaa ho
 But despite these specialties, this encyclopedia is not a high quality work
 isamen sthal-sthal par trutiyaan evam visangatiyaan thim
 It was a mixture of high and low quality essays in almost equal proportions
 is vishwakosh kii katu aalochanaayen bhi huin
 Didero and A'lambart decided that their encyclopaedia would document all knowledge, giving knowledge of all kinds of arts and craftsmanship as a matter of serious study, with special attention to the classification of various branches of knowledge and their interrelationships
 And will try to permanently change the normal methods of contemplation in the light of ideas emanating from enlightenment
 pehle teenon lakshya to haris or chembers ne bhi vedhane kii koshish kii thi lekin yah chauthaa makasad kuch khaas tarah kaa tha
 The editors-duo wanted to dismiss the medieval philosophy and establish the imperative of scientific thinking in the light of sensualism, so that future generations are forced to think in a new way
 unke liye indrianubhavvaad kaa sidhaa matlab tha indriyon ko sabhi tarah ke gyaan kaa ekmaatr pramanik strot maananaa or tab tak kisi bhi daawey ko gyaan kii sangya na dena jab tak vah anubhav or prayog kii kasuti par khara na sabit ho jaae
 According to this theory, which emphasizes the experience gained through the five senses, proof of knowledge should also be confirmed by sensory observational experience
 indrianubhavvaad kii jaden is vichaar main nihit thim ki yah jagat keval utana hi he jitna vah hamen apane bare main bataane ke liye taiyaar he
 Therefore, we should observe this world in a neutral way without any rage and malice
 prekshniya soochna praapt karne ke raste main daali gayi koi bhi baadha gyaan ko vikrut karke use manamaani kalpana kaa shikaar bana degi
 The urges of observation, experience and experiment emerged from the womb of sensualism, which later left an indelible impression on the philosophy of science, giving prominence to inductive reasoning
 maanviya indriyajanit anubhav ko gyanamimasak praathamikta milane ke saamaajik, raajnneetik or naitik falitarth hone laazmi the
 Man and his ecological world were to come to the center of all thinking and understanding
 inacychlopidi kaa pathak us jigyaasu ke rup main saamne aayaa jo daawa kar saktaa tha ki usamen tathy ko mithyaa se alag karke jaanchne-parakhane kii kshamta he
 This reader was going to deny the need of proof given by any higher authority for this value-judgment
 swaabhaavik taur par ansien rezim kii numaaindgi karne vaali tatkaaleen saamaajik or rajkeey vyavastha is naye gyaan or uske aadhaar par banane vaale naye vyakti main nihit sambhavaanaon ke prati kisi kism kii gafalat main nahin rah sakati thi
 He quickly realized that the books of knowledge Didero and A'lambart have been publishing, section by section, will eventually prove to be an silent tool of the decay of the monarchy's legitimacy
 isi ke parinamswaroop keval teen saal ke bheetar 1751 main paris ke arqbishap ne inacychlopidi kii bhartsana kii or agle saal royal concil of state ne uske prakaashan ko pratibandhit kar diya
 In 1759, the Parliament of Paris also condemned the project of enlightenment and by an order withdrawing all the facilities which had been given to Didero and d'almbert

 unhone rambhakti kii dhara ko samaaj ke nichle tabake tak pahunchaaya
 He was the first such Acharya who preached devotion in North India
 unke bare main prachlit kahawat he ki - dwavid bhakthi upjau-laayo ramanand
 That is, the credit of propagating devotion in North India goes to Swami Ramanand
 unhone tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt kuritiyon jaise chuaachhut, oonch-neech or jaat-paat kaa virodh kiya
 Swami Ramanand was born in a Brahmin family in Prayag
 unki mata kaa naam sushila devi or pita kaa naam punya sadan sharma tha
 In the early period, he started showing many supernatural miracles
 dharmik vichaaron vaale unke mata-pita ne balak ramanand ko shiksha paane ke liye kaashi ke swami radhvanand ke paas shrimath bhej diya
 While living in Srimath, he studied the Vedas, Puranas and other scriptures and became a scholar
 panchganga ghat sthit shrimath main rahete hue unhone kathor sadhana kii
 There are many misconceptions about his birthday, but most scholars believe that Swamiji was born in 1300 AD
 yani aaj se koi saat sau das saal pehle
 Swami Ramanand made the door of Rama Bhakti accessible to all
 unhone anantanand, bhavanand, peepa, sen, dhanna, nabha das, narharyanand, sukhanand, kabir, raidas, sursari, padamavati jaise baarah logon ko apana pramukh shishy banaaya, jinhe dwadash mahabhagwat ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Among them, Kabir Das and Raidas later gained considerable fame
 kabir auki ravidaas ne nirgun ram kii upasna kii
 In this way, Swami Ramanand was such a great saint under whose shade both saguna and nirgun saints and worshipers found rest
 jab samaaj main chaaro ore aapasi katoota or vaimnasy kaa bhav bharaa nua tha, vaise samay main swami ramanand ne naaraa diya-jaat-paat puche naa koi-firi ko bhajai so hari kaa hoi
 unhone survey prapattedhikarinon matah kaa shankhanaad kiya or bhakthi kaa margh sabake liye khol diya
 He also gave women equal place in the canopy of devotion
 unke dwaara sthapit ramanand sampradaay yaa ramavat sampradaay aaj vaishnavon kaa sabase bada dharmik jamaat he
 Of the 52 gates of the Vaishnavas, 36 gates belong to the Ramanandis only
 is sampradaay ke sant bairangi bhi kahe jate hai
 They also have their own arenas
 yun to ramanand sampradaay kii shakhaaen auki upashakhaayen desh bhar main faili hai
 But there are hundreds of monasteries of this sect in Ayodhya, Chitrakoot, Nashik, Haridwar
 kaashi ke panchganga ghat par avasthit shrimath, duniya bhar main faile ramanandiyon kaa mul gurusthaan he
 In other words, the Shrimath of Kashi is the original Acharya Peetha of the Saguna and Nirgun Rambhakti tradition and the Ramanand community
 vartmaan main jagadguru ramanandacharya swami shriramnareshacharyaji maharaj, shrimath ke gaadi par virajman hai
 He is a learned scholar of jurisprudence and is acclaimed in the Sant Samaj
 swami ramanand ne bhakthi maarg kaa prachaar karne ke liye desh bhar kii yatraaen kii
 He went to many religious places in Puri and South India and preached Rambhakti
 pehle unhen swami ramnuj kaa anuyaadi mana jaataa tha lekin srisampradaay kaa acharya hone ke baavjood unhone apni upasna paddati main kaam or sita ko variyata di
 He made them his worshipers
 ram bhakthi kii paavan dhara ko himalay kii paavan oonchaiyon se utarkar swami ramanand ne garibon or vanchiton kii jhopadi tak pahunchaaya
 ve bhakthi maarg ke aise sopan the jinhone vaishnav bhakthi sadhana ko nayaa aayam diya
 Their sacred feet are still safe in Shrimath, Kashi, which is the center of faith of crores of Ramanandis
 swamiji ne bhakthi ke prachaar main sanskrit kii jagah lokbhasha ko praathamikta gi

 bhartiya dharm, darshan, sahitya or samskruti ke vikaas main bhagwat dharm tathaa vaishnav bhakthi se sambhddha vaicharik kranti kii mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 Swami Ramananda emerged about seven hundred and nine years ago in the same superior tradition of great saints of Vaishnava devotion
 unhone shri sitaaji dwaara prithvi par pravartit vishishtadvait siddhant tathaa rambhakti kii dhara ko madhyakaal main anupam tivrata pradaan kii
 He is acknowledged as the proponent of the modern Bhakti path in Uttarabharata and the original promoter of Vaishnava cultivation
 ek prasiddh lokokti ke anusaar- In the erstwhile society, by removing the extreme animosity and bitterness among the various sect-sects, Hindu society did an important work of formulation
 swamiji ne maryaada purushottam shriram ko adarsh maanakar saral rambhakti maarg kaa nidarshan kiya
 In his disciple circle, while on the one hand there were casteist, untouchable, Vedic rituals like Kabirdas, Raidas, Sennai and Pipanresh, anti-virtue saints of idolatry, on the other side, archanavatar, a full-fledged supporter of avatarism, considered idolatrous masters Swami Anantananda, Bhavananda, Sursurananda, Sagunopasak Acharya like Narahariyananda was also a devotee
 usee parampara main krishnadutt payohari jaisaa tejasvi sadhak or goswami tulsidas jaisaa vishwa vishrut mahakavi bhi utpann hua
 It is famous about Acharya Ramanand that he preached Tarak Ramantra by climbing trees so that people of all castes can fall in ears and get maximum welfare of people
 unhone naaraa diya tha- Acharyapada independently enforced the Sreesapradaya
 is sampradaay ko ramanandi athwa vairaagi sampradaay bhi kehete hai
 He described the distinction of caste-line in the path of devotion with the feeling of strengthening the society, shattering and falling down, and said that the path of refuge of God is equally open to all- kahkar unhone kisi bhi jati-varan ke vyakti ko ramamantra dene main sankoch nahin kiya
 Raidas, born in tanner caste and raised in Kabul's home, Kabirdas are unique examples of this
 madhyayugin dharm sadhana ke centre main swami ji kii sthiti chatushpath ke deep-stambh jaisi he
 He protected society and culture with great vigor by initiating unprecedented social revolution
 unheen ke chalate uttarbharat main tirth kshetron kii raksha or vahaan saanskrithik kendron kii sthapana sambhav ho saki
 According to the circumstances of that era, Vairagini organized an active idolized form of Dharma to protect the pilgrimage by organizing the Sadhu Samaj as a prostitute equipped with weapons
 tirthasthanon se lekar gaanv-gaanv main vairaagi saadhuon ne akhaade sthapit kiye
 Even in this asymmetrical state of depreciation, all the monasteries, saints, Ramgunagans, Akhand Ramnath Sankirtans of the Ramanand Sampradaya are still organized throughout the world and are spreading spiritual light everywhere
 vaishnavon ke baawan dwaaron main sarvaadhik santis dwaare isi sampradaay se jude hai
 Apart from this, its branch, prashaka and avantara branches spread like Ramsnehi, Kabirdasi, Ghisapanthi, Dadupanth etc
 have become the conduits of the origin of this sect
 yah swami ramanand ke hi vyaktitv kaa prabhaav tha ki hindu-muslim vaimnasy, shaiva-vaishnav vivaad, varna-vidwesh, mat-matantar kaa jhagada or paraspar saamaajik katutaa bahut had tak kam ho gai
 Impressed by the miracle of his own compound power, the then Mughal ruler Mohammad Tughlaq came to the shelter of Swami Ramanandacharya through Sant Kabirdas and issued a directive to remove all restrictions on the Hindus and Jaziyakar
 balpurvak islam dharm main dikshit hinduon ko phir se hindu dharm main waapas laane ke liye paravartan sanskaar kaa mahaan kaary sarvapratham swami ramanandaarch ne hi prarambh kiya
 History testifies that thirty-four thousand Rajputs under the leadership of King Harisingh of Ayodhya had inspired Swamiji to adopt Swadharma from a single platform
