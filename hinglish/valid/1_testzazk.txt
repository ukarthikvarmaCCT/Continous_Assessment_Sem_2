 With the advent of Java 2, new versions had a multi-shape built for a wide variety of platforms
 udhaahranswarup, enterprize aplication ke liye lakshith J2EE or mobile aplication ke liye atyant naveen varsan J2ME 
 J2SE ne maanak sanskaran ko lakshith kiya
 In 2006, for business purposes, Sun renamed the new versions of J2 to Java EE, Java ME and Java SE, respectively
 1997 main, san microsystemus ne java ko amali jama pehanaane ke liye ISO / IEC JTC1 maanak samiti ko or baad main aikma antarashtriya ko prastaav bheja, par jald hi yah is prakriya se hat gai
 Java remains a de facto standard controlled by the Java community process
 apane software maalik hone ke darje ke baavjood, ek baar san ne bina shulk ke java karyanvayan kaa adhikansh hissaa uplabdh karaayaa
 san ne java se vishesh utpaada jaise java interprise system ko license bechakar munafa kamaaya
 san ne apane software development kit or rantime envyranment ) main bhed kiya; praathmik bhed main JRE kaa compiler kii kami, upyogita program or header files shaamil hai
 On 13 November 2006, Sun released most of Java as free and open source software, subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License
 8 may 2007 ko san ne prakriya kaa samaapan kiya, code ke ek chote se hisse jis par san kaa prakashnadhikaar nahin he, use chhodkar baaki java ke sabhi kor code ko muft software / mukt-strot vitaran shart ke tahat uplabdh karaayaa
 There were five main objectives of creating Java language: haalanki java kaa adhikansh pratyaksh munafa licencing or JCP sadsyta raashi se aata he, kuch maanate hai ki java pramukhtah hardware sarwar ko badhaava dene kaa ek vaahan or / yaa aantarik rup se san ke liye solaaris OS kii bikri hai or san ke upaadhyaksh rich green ne kaha ki java ke liye san kii adarsh bhoomika "enjilwad" ke jaisi he
 One feature of Java is affordability, which means that computer programs written in the Java language function similarly on any hardware supported / operating system platform
 ise java bhashaa sanket ko sankalit karke praapt kiya gaya he, mashin code se nahin balki java bitcode se, - nirdesh mashin sanket ke anuroop he lekin vishesh taur par host hardware ke liye likhit virtual mashin dwaara bhashantarit karnaa abhisht hoga
 End-users generally use the Java runtime environment in a web browser for standalone usage machines and / or Java applets installed on their own machine
 maanaktaprapt libraries host vishisht suvidhaon jaise:- arekhi, threading or netwarking ke abhigaman ke liye ek kriyasheel rasta pradaan karte hai
 The most important benefit of using bytecode is affordability
 However, the overhead of interpretation means that interpreted programs always run more slowly than programs compiled from native executables, and Java's reputation is damaged due to poor performance
 haal hi main JVM karyanvayan main kai ishttameekaran takneekon ke aane se yah pareshaani thodi kam ho gai he
 Sun Microsystems officially licenses Java Standard Edition platforms for Linux, Mac OS x and Solaris
 Although Sun has previously licensed Java to Microsoft, the license has expired and has not been renewed
 tisare-samooh ke vikritaon or licendhariyon ke network dwaara, vaikalpik java envyranment iske or duusare plateformas ke liye uplabdh hai
 Sun's trademark license to use the Java brand asserts that all implementations are 'appropriate'
 iskaa parinaam Microsoft ke saath kanoonee vivaad ke rup main niklaa jab san ne daawa kiya ki Microsoft kriyanvayan RMI or JNI ko samarthan nahin karti or isamen uske swayan ke atirikt plateform-vishisht visheshtaayen hai
 Sun went on trial in 1997 and received a payment of $ 20 million in 2001 as well as a court order enforcing the terms of Sun's license
 parinamswaroop, Microsoft ne windos ke saath java ko zyada din nahin chalaaya or windos ke haal ke varsano main, internet explorer bina teesri party ke niyantran ke java eppeplats ko samarthan nahin kar saktaa
 san or dusron ne windos ke us or anya varsano ke liye muft java ran-time system uplabdh karaayaa
 Platform-independent Java is essential to the Java EE strategy and even more strict legalization is required to authenticate the implementation
 antahsthapit java envyranment kaa upyog karke, yah envyranment vahneey sarwar-said jaise web services, sarvalets or interprise javabins, saath hi saath osgi par aadhaarit antahsthapit system ko sakasham banaata he
 Through the Glassfish project, Sun is working on a fully operational, integrated open source implementation of Java EE technology
 san JRE kaa superset bhi vitarit karata he jise java deveopment kit, kaha jaataa he jisame vikaas upkaran jaise java compiler, javadok, jaar or dibgar shaamil he
 It is difficult to compare the performance of a Java program to its equivalent program originally written in a compiled language because the target platform of Java's bytecode compiler is the Java platform itself, and the bytecode is either interpreted or compiled into machine code by the JVM
 goes
 in do bhinn drushtikonon: sthitik banaam gatisheel sankalan or punah sankalan or anya se utpann paridrishyon kii tulana karnaa bahut kathin or alag he
 Programs written in Java have been slower and require more memory than programs written in compiled languages
 jo kuch bhi ho, just-in time sankalan, ke aagaman ke kaaran java prograamon kii kriyanvayan gati teji se badi he, atirikt bhashaa visheshtaayen uttam code vishleshan, or java virtual mashin main swany ishtatameekaran ko samarthan karti he
 Java uses an automated garbage collector to manage memory throughout the object life cycle
 programmer nirdhaarit kar letaa he kab object kaa nirmaan hoga or ek baar object jab or upyog ke laayak nahin rah jaataa to uske smriti ko punah praapt karne kii jimmedaari java rantime kii hoti he
 Once no reference to the object remains, the inaccessible object becomes eligible to be automatically freed by the container
 kuch kuch memory risaav ke samaan tab bhi jari rah saktaa he agar ek programmer kaa code kisi object kaa ek sandarbh jisaki ab or jarurat nahin he use pakadta he, usee tarah jab objects jisaki or jarurat nahin he vah us container main sangrahit he jo abhi bhi istemaal main he
 If methods are called for a non-existent object, a "null pointer exception" is thrown
 java ke swachaalit smriti prabandhan model ke peeche ek vichaar yah he ki programmers niyamit smriti prabandhan ko prardashit karne kaa boj thodaa kam kar le
 kuch bhashaaon main object ke nirmaan ke liye smriti steke par anumaan se aavantit kii jaati he yaa spashtatya aavantit hoti he or dher se punah aavantit kii jaati hai
 In every way, the responsibility of memory management rests with the programmer
 agar kaarykram kisi object ko punahavanton nahin karata he to ek smriti risaav utpann hone lagata he
 If the program tries to access or reallocate memory that has already been reallocated, then the results become difficult to predict and interpret and the programs are likely either unstable and / or terminated
 ise smart sanketon ke istemaal se anshatah thik kiya ja saktaa he lekin yah uprivyay or jatilta ko badhaata he
 Garbage collection can occur at any time
 adarshatah yah tab hoga jab kaarykram khaali rahata he
 It is sure to run if there is insufficient free memory to allocate to the new object, which may cause a program to be installed momentarily
 spasht smriti prabandhan java main sambhav nahin he
 Java does not support c / c ++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses and unmarked integers can be used interchangeably
 yah kachra colector ko sandarbhit objectos ko sthanantarit karne kii anumati detaa he or iskaa bachaav or suraksha sunishchit karata he
 As in c ++ and some other object-oriented languages, Java's variable primary type is not an object
 praathmik prakaaron kii upyogita ko yaa to kshetron main pratyaksh rup se sanchit kiya jaataa he yaa dheron par naa ki steke par, jaisaa object ke liye saamaanya taur par sahi he 
 This was a conscious decision taken by Java's designers for demonstration
 iske kaaran, java ko ek shuddh object-unmukh programing bhashaa nahin mana gaya
 Whatever it is, as in Java 5
0, self-operation enables programmers to proceed if the primary types are instances of their wrapper ranges
 java ke vaakyavinyas zyaadaatar C++ se vyutpann he
 Unlike c ++, which combines design, methodology and program syntax, Java was created as an object-oriented language only
 sabhi code ek class ke bheetar likhe gaye hai or sabhi kuch ek object he; antarbhoot aakadon ke prakaaron ko chhodkar, jo pradarshan kaarnon se claason nahin he
 Java hides many features for classes, to simplify the language and to prevent natural errors and clutter
 java C++ kii tarah hi samiksha paddati upyog karti he
 There are two different types of reviews: single line style marking with two forward slashes and a multiline style open forward slash with asterisk and closed one asterisk with forward slash
 udhaaharan: Traditionally, helloworld
java is a public class naming of source files by applying the 
java suffix
 iskaa sankalan helloworld
class ke naam se file upadit karke sabase pehle java compiler kaa istemaal karke bitcode main hona chahie
 Only then can it be implemented or "executed"

 a class that has been declared private can be stored in any 
java file

 The name of the class file is the name of the class, with 
class attached
 For class file generations, unnamed classes are handled as if their name was a combination of their attached class name, a $, and an integer
 mukhya shabd public suchit karata he ki ek pranali duusare claason main code ke dwaara laayaa ja saktaa he, yaa class padanukram ke baahar claason ke dwaara class kaa prayog ho saktaa he
 The class hierarchy relates to the name of the directory in which the Java file resides

 Only positional systems can be invited without reference to an object
 sthitik pranaliyaan kisi bhi char pranali jo sthitik nahin he uskaa abhigam nahin kar saktin
 The word void indicates that the main system does not return any value to the caller
 If a Java program is to exit with the wrong code, it will explicitly call System
exit
 pranali naam "main" java bhashaa main mukhya shabd nahin he
 This is just the name of the system the Java Creator calls the program to extend control
 java claason jo prabandhit parivesh jaise applates or interprise java beans main chalate hai usko main pranali kii zarurat nahin padati hai yaa istemaal nahin karte

 The main system] docs / api / java / lang / String

 Traditionally, it is referred to as args although any legal identifying name can be used
 java 5 ke samay se, mukhya pranali ko string yuktiyon ke swechhachari sankhya ke saath aamantran ko anumati dete hue public static void main ke rup main, mukhya pranali parivartit yuktiyon kaa bhi istemaal kar saktaa he
 The effect of this optional declaration is semantically recognizable, but it allows alternative syntax to construct and extend the table

 Proportional representation has been adopted in various forms, however there is a commonality among them, which is also an essential part of the system that this system cannot be used without multi-member constituencies

 saamanyat: is pranali ke antargat vibhinn raajnneetik dalon kii soochiyon ko unke praapt kiye gaye maton ke anusaar sadsy die jate hai
 This system can best be interpreted under the Weimar Legislative Assembly of Germany in 1930 by the electoral system of the lower house of the German Parliament, the Reichtag, which is called the Baden Plan
 is aayojana ke anusaar rishtag kii kul sankhya niyat nahin thi varan nirvachan main daale gaye maton kii kul sankhya ke anusaar ghatati-badhati rahati thi
 One representative was elected for every 60,000 votes, known as quotas
 germany ko 35 chunaavakshetron main baant diya gaya tha or inako milakar 17 chunaav bhaagon main
 Each political party had the right to submit three types of lists: Local List, State List and National List
 prayek matadaata apana mat pratinidhi ko na dekar kisi na kisi raajnneetik dal ko detaa tha
 After the counting of votes in each constituency, each political party was given as many representatives from the first candidate above the local list as on the basis of the quota according to the total votes received; Thereafter, after adding the remaining votes of local areas in each state, then each party is given special members from the state list and similarly by adding the remaining votes in all the regional areas, special members according to the quota from the national list and if there are remaining votes on it If a special member got more than 30,000 votes, that party would get more
 is prakaar badenpranali ne anupatik pratinidhaan ke is siddhant ko ki "koi bhi mat vyarth na janaa chahie" kaa taarkik nishkarsh tak paalan kiya
 The biggest drawback of this system is that voters do not have personal freedom in the election of representatives
 ekal sankramntic mat yaa hair pranali ke anusaar pratinidhiyon kaa nirvachan saamaanya suchi dwaara hota he, nirvachan ke samay prayek matadaata, ummidavaaron ke naam ke aage apni ruchi ke anusaar 1, 2, 3, 4 ityadi sankhya likh detaa he
 The first step is to conclude the quota from calculation kota ko praapt karne ke liye daale gaye maton kii kul sankhya ko nirvachankshetra ke niyat sadasyon kii sankhya main ek jodakar, bhaag karke, taduparant parinamfal main ek jod diya jaataa he, arthath : First those candidates who are declared quota are declared elected
 yadi isse samast sthanon kii purti nahin hoti tab purvanirvaachit sadasyon ke kota se adhik maton ko unke matadaataaon main unki ruchi ke anusaar baant diya jaataa he
 If the seats are not filled even then, then at least votes are distributed by the candidate's vote till the total seats are filled
 anubhav se prathit hota he ki ekal sankramntic pranali matadaataaon ko nirvachan main swatantraaa tathaa prayek samooh ko sankhya ke anusaar pratinidhitiv pradaan karti he
 It is also characterized by the fact that political parties cannot take undue advantage in elections, but critics say that this election is beyond the intelligence of ordinary voters
 apane gunon ke kaaran anupatik pratinidhitiv kaa badi shighrata se prachaar hua he
 Even before the First World War, the list system was being used mostly in the Lok Sabha elections in many countries of Europe
 denmark main to 1855 main hi sansad ke ucch bhawan ke nirvachan ke liye iskaa prayog aarambh ho gaya tha
 Subsequently, in 1891, Switzerland adopted it for territorial parliaments and in 1895 for Belgium, for local elections and in 1899 for parliament
 sweden ne 1907 main, denmark ne 1915 main, holland ne 1917 main, switzaraland ne 1918 main or norway ne 1919 main is pranali ko purna rup se sab chunaavon ke liye lagu kar diya
 After the First World War, proportional representation in some form or the other was given to all the new legislations in Europe
 angreji bhashi deshon main adhiktar ekal sankramntic pranali kaa prayog hua he
 In the UK the system has been used since 1918 in the election of representatives of the Universities of Parliaments, and for the General Assembly of the Church of England, in Scotland since 1919 for educational institutions, in Northern Ireland since 1920, members of both Houses of Parliament
 for
 ireland ke vidhaan ke anusaar saare chunaav isi pranali dwaara hote hai
 It is used in South Africa in the Senate and some local elections
 canada main bhi sthaneey chunaav isi aadhaar par hote hai
 In the United States, the system has not yet been used in elections other than local elections
 dwitiya mahayuddh ne is andolan ko or aage badhaayaa; udaahranarth, france ke chaturth ganatantreey vidhaan ne samanya suchi ko apni nirvachanvidhi main sthaan diya
 Subsequently, new legislations in Ceylon, Burma and Indonesia have adopted a single transferable vote system
 bharatvarsh main lok-pratinidhaan-adhiniyamon tathaa niyamon ke antargat lagbhag saare chunaav ekal sankramntic matpranali dwaara hi hote hai
 a number of arguments can be made in favor and opposition to the proportional representation system
 isamen to andeh nahin ki saidvantik tathaa vyaavhaarik drushti se yah pranali yadi yatharth rup main lagu kii jaae to apane uddeshy main safalataa praapt kar sakati he
 It undoubtedly protects the representation of all major groups in society
 aise deshon main jahaan jaateey tathaa saamaajik alpsankhyak samooh hai, is pranali kaa vishesh mahatv he
 The statement of critics that this system is entangled does not seem logical
 pratham to yah pranali swayan hi ek prakaar kii raajnneetik shiksha kaa saadhan he or jahaan tak uljhan tathaa vishmata kaa prashn he, usko nipun tathaa suyogy adhikari kii niyukti se dur kiya ja saktaa he
 a criticism of proportional representation is also that it promotes the increase in the number of political parties, which in turn makes it difficult for a single party to have a majority in Parliament, making most of the cabinet joint and consequentially temporary
 parantu belgium tathaa switzaraland jaise deshon ke raajnneetik anubhavon se yah tark niraadhaar prathit hota he, kyonki kisi desh kii raajnneetik dalpaddati itani us desh kii nirvachanpaddati par nirbhar nahin karti jitani us desh kii saamaajik, aarthik, dharmik, jaateey, bhashaa sambandhi tathaa raajnneetik paristhitiyon par
 The magnitude of the two-dimensional shape of a plane is called area

 Fiqh is called Islamic theology
 fiqh musalamaanon ke liye islamic jivan ke har pahalu par apana asar rakhata he
 While the Shari'a calls that set of policy
 jo islamic kanoonee, paramparaon or islamic vyaktigat or naitik aacharnon par aadhaarit hoti he
 Fiqh is the terminology for Islamic jurisprudence, which is made up of the judgments of Islamic jurists
 islamic adhyayan kaa buniyadi ghatak, fiqh us paddati ko vistaar se batalaata he jiske jariye se islamic kanoon ko praathmik or madhyamik sroton se baahar nikaala gaya he
 The history of Islamic jurisprudence is "divided into eight periods by custom"
 mahatvata ke kram main fiqh ke strot hai: The Qur'an gives clear instructions on many issues such as how to perform purification rituals before compulsory daily prayers, but on other issues, some Muslims believe that the Qur'an alone is not enough to make things clear
 udhaaharan ke liye, koran ke anusaar— ramadan ke maheene ke dauraan, dainik prarthanaayen or upwas main sanlagn hone kii zarurat he lekin musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki in kartavyon kaa paalan karne ke tareeke ke bare main unhen or hidaayat kii aavashyaktaa he
 Explanations of these issues can be found in the traditions of Prophet Muhammad, so in most cases the arguments are the basis of the Quran and Sunnah
 islam ke praarambhik kaal main kuch vishay bina misaal ke hai un maamalon main, musalmaan nyayavid anya tareekon se nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Sunni jurists exercise the historical consensus of the community; In the modern era, most jurists also use analogy and comparison of the profit and loss of new subjects
 in atirikt upkarnon kii sahaayta se nishkarsh aane par sharia ke hisaab se kanoonon kii ek vyapak sarani banati he or ise fiqh kaha jaataa he
 Thus, in the face of the Shari'ah, Fiqh is not considered sacred, and there are disproportionate views on other aspects of the 'schools of thought process' without looking at them as sacred
 adhik vistrut muddon main vyakhya ke yah vibhaajan vichaar-prakriya ke vibhinn skulon main parinamswaroop mila he islamic nyaayashastra kii yah vyapak avadharana vibhinn vishyon main kai kanoonon kaa strot he jo rosemara kii jindagi main musalamaanon ko nirdeshit karata he
 The study of jurisprudence is called Fiqh or Fiqh by making the foundation of Shari'a policy
 fiqh ke maamle main islamic vidwaanon kii alag alag vyakhyaaon ke kaaran islam main nyaayashastra kai bhaagon main bat gaya or kai alag alag nyaayashastra se sambandhit vichaardhaaron kaa janm hua
 These are called religions
 sunni islam main pramukh mazahab hai: Most Muslims believe that all four religions are fundamentally correct, and the differences are in the nuanced interpretations of jurisprudence

 perilin ek carbonic yogic he
 a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances is called a solution
 kisi nishchit taapmaana par vilyan ke upaadaanon kaa aapekshik anupaat ek seemaa tak parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 a homogeneous mixture is formed when the sugar is dissolved in water
 yah samaangi mishran chini kaa pani main vilyan kehalaata he
 When two substances are exposed to each other, there can be four consequences: yadi ham khadiya ke kuch tukdon ko pani main daalkar bhalee bhanti hilaa dulaakar rakh den, to khadiya ke tukade paatr ke pende main baith jaayenge or pani se ghire rahenge
 If finely grind the chalk and add it to the water, the mixture of very small particles of chalk with water becomes like milk and it stays in the same condition for some time
 yahan khadiya kaa pani main paayas bana he
 If the filter is filtered on paper, the chalk will be separated from the water
 yadi namak ke tukade ko pani main daalen or use hilaawein dulaaven, to kuch hi samay main namak kaa tukdaa pani main ghulkar samaapt ho jayega or jo padaarth banegaa vah pani sa hi dikhaai padegaa
 If you taste it, it will taste salty
 aise namak ghule jal ko namak kaa jal main vilyan kehete hai
 Chalice does not dissolve in water, it is insoluble in water
 par bahut maheen khadiya yadhyapi pani ke saath ghulti nahin he, tathaapi vah paayas yaa imlshan ban jaati he
 Salt is soluble in water
 kya namak aparimit maatra main jal main ghul saktaa he? nahin, jal main namak ke, vastut: kisi bhi lavan ke, jal main ghulne kii ek seemaa hoti he
 This limit also depends on heat and, in the case of gases, pressure
 jis namak ke vilyan main or namak na ghul sake, use ham namak kaa santrupt vilyan kehete hai
 The solution in which more salt dissolves is called unsaturated solution
 kabhi kabhi ham kuch thos padaarthon ko itani maatra main ghulaa sakate hai ki vilyan main unki maatra santrupt vilyan main upasthit maatra se adhik rahe, to aise vilyan ko atisantripta vilyan kaha jaataa he
 Most supercritical solutions are usually temporary and are formed under a specific condition
 adhik ghulaa hua thos usase kabhi bhi nikal kar alag ho ja saktaa he
 The dissolving substance is dissolved and the dissolving substance is called a solvent
 jab gaisen yaa koi thos kisi drav main ghulata he, tab drav ko vilaayak evam gas yaa thos ko viley kehete hai
 When one fluid dissolves in another, the higher volume is called solvent and the lower volume is called solute
 vilaayak do prakaar ke hote hai : ek ko dhruviya or duusare ko adhruviya kehete hai
 Polar solvents contain hydroxyl or carboxyl groups and are relatively active and have high reflectivity
 adhruviya vilaayak rasayanat niskriy hote hai or inkaa paravaidyuthank nimna hota he
 Polar solvents are more potent and dissolve many substances
 ek duusari drushti se vilaayakon ko acarbonic or carbonic vilaayakon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The location of water is of paramount importance in inorganic solvents
 vilaayak ke rup main isaki shreshthata is kaaran he ki yah saralata se shuddh rup main prapya he
 It is neither toxic nor flammable
 ooshmaa se isamen koi parivartan nahin hota or anek padaarthon ko yah ghulaata he
 It is also widely used as a solvent in herbs
 par anek carbonic padaarth jal main nahin ghulte hai
 The solvents that behave to dissolve these organic materials are called organic solvents
 anek udhyogdhandhon main carbonic vilaayakon kaa vyavhaar hota he
 Some organic solvents are hydrocarbons, some halogen compounds, some alcohols, ketones, ethers, and esters
 kuch vilaayak bade vashpashil hote hai tathaa kuch vishakt bhi
 Therefore, great care is required in their use
 aise vashpashil evam vishakt vilaayak petrol, naphtha, benzin, toluin, methenul, ethanol, butenul, asitone, ether, chloroform, carbon tetracloride, amil isitate aadi hai
 These solvents are used in large quantities in paints, varnishes, lacquers and other non-coating types of coating
 anek vastuon kii safai main vilaayak kaam main aate hai
 Cleaning of wood and metal articles is also done by solvents
 inase mile dhulkar nikal jaati he or vastu saaf ho jaati he
 At one time petrol, or benzene, was widely used in the washing of woolen garments
 jvalansheeltaa ke kaaran hydrocarbonon kaa sthaan chlorinavaale yogic, trichloroethilin or carbon tetracloride le rahe hai
 Non-toxic solvents should be used in food, medicines and cosmetics
 inamen aruchikar gandh yaa swaad bhi na rahanaa chahie
 Hence only ethyl alcohols behave in tincture extracts etc
 jahaan avashpashil yaa mithe swadwale vilaayak kii aavashyaktaa padati he, vahaan glissrol or glikol prayukt hote hai
 Solvents are also used to extract a specific compound from many natural substances
 prakritik sroton se vilaayakon ke dwaara hi alcaloid, chlorophyl, penicillin, tel aadi naanaa prakaar ke padaarth nikaale jate hai
 If two gases are exposed to each other, it can have two consequences: yadi gas ko drav ke sampark main laayaa jaae, to vishisht taap or daab par gas drav main ghulkar santrupt vilyan banaati he
 Some gases, such as ammonia, or hydrogen chloride, dissolve too much in water, and some gases, such as nitrogen, or oxygen, dissolve less in water
 gaison kii vileyata gaison kii prakruti, vilaayakon kii prakruti, taap or dabaav par nirbhar karti he, jaisaa neeche kii sarini se prakat he : It is clear from the above table that solubility of gases decreases with high temperature and solubility increases with high pressure
 sodawater kii bottle main adhik dabaav par hi carbon dioxide adhik ghulaa hua rahata he or bottle ke kholane par dabaav kam hone par adhik ghuli hui gas budbud karke nikal jaati he
 If the mixture of gases is dissolved, the different gases dissolve independently according to their solubility and the presence of other gases does not affect their solubility
 kai drav ek duusare main kisi bhi anupaat main milaane se ghul jate hai
 Water and methanol are all soluble in proportion
 inhen ham mishraneey kehete hai
 Those fluids are miscible liquids, in which they are chemically similar
 kuch drav aise hai jo ek duusare main bilkul nahin ghulte, jaise paara or pani, pani or benzin
 We call them immutable
 kuch drav aise hote hai jo ek duusare main kuch ghul jate hai or ghulkar do str banaate hai
 Two such fluids are water and ether
 jal or ithur ke milaane se do str ban jate hai
 The top level is of ether and the bottom is of water
 parantu upar ke ether ke str main kuch jal tathaa neeche ke jal ke str main kuch ether bhi ghulaa hua rahata he
 They are partly miscible liquids and these two levels are called conjugate levels
 yahan bhi vileyata taap or kuch seemaa tak daab par nirbhar karti he
 Solubility of solids in liquids is limited
 prayek taap par thoson kii ek nishchit maatra hi drav main ghulti he
 a lot depends on the solute and the nature of the solvent
 saadharantaya anek lavan jal main vilayashil hote hai
 Some salts, such as ammonium nitrate, are very soluble in water and some salts, such as calcium sulfate, are soluble in water
 jab koi thos kisi drav main ghulata he, to saamanyatya ooshmaa kaa avasorana hota he
 The solubility of solids generally increases with the increase in heat, but there are some exceptions
 calcium sulphate or calcium isitate kii vileyata taap kii vruddhi se kuch kam ho jaati he
 If the solubility of a solid is high at high temperatures, that solid can be purified by crystallisation
 unche taap par santrupt vilyan banaakar, usko thandha karne se adhik maatra main viley padaarth ke crystal pruthak hokar shuddh rup main praapt hote hai
 a low amount of impurities does not form a saturated solution, and frosting does not lead to crystals
 thoson kaa thoson main bhi vilyan banataa he
 Either these can dissolve completely to form a miscible solid or partially dissolve to form conjugate layers
 anek mishradhatuen thoson ke vilyan he, yaa anshat: mishraneey mishran hai
 Solutions of solids are not formed by mixing of solids only, but are made by mixing them thoroughly
 saadharantaya kisi vastu kii vileyata ko uske pratishat sanghatan main pradarshit karte hai
 When we say that a salt solution is a 15% solution, it means that 15 grams of salt are dissolved in a 100 volume solvent
 yah reeti vaigyanik nahin he
 Scientists display the concentration by gram-molecule-concentration
 ek litre vilyan main jitani gram-anu-bhaar kii maatra ghuli hui hoti he usee se sandran kii maap jaani jaati he
 This is called gram-anukta
 chunki taap or daab se vilyan kaa aaytan ghatata badhata he, at: sandran pradarshit karne ke liye yah upyukt nahin he
 In its place there is the behavior of the village molecule
 100 gram vilyan main viley kaa kitna gram anu ghulaa hua he yah gram aanwata darshaati he
 If the solution is dilute, then the gram molarity and atoms for a specific solute and solvent are proportional to each other for different concentrations
 vishleshan main vilyanon kaa sandran normalata dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 One gram of a solute is dissolved in a liter of normal solution
 vilyanon ke anya sandran narmalata main hi suchit kiye jate hai, jaise 2 narmal, 5 narmal 10 narmal, dashansh narmal, sahasransh narmal ityadi
 a scientist named Rouault established a quantitative relationship between the vapor pressure of the solution and the concentration of the solute, which is called the Rowlatt law
 kisi vilyan main avashpashil viley upasthit hone par sthir taap par avashpashil viley ke vilyan ke upar present vilaayak kaa vaashp daab vilaayak ke mol prabhaaj ke samaanupati hota he

 a heart beat results when an electrical impulse passes through the atria ventricles to the AV and contract to the atrioventricular node
 During the AF, if the impulses from all the atria passed through the node AV, the heart must be produced there
 Security constraints severe ventricular tachycardia severe resulting === thromboembolism In atrial fibrillation, atrial contraction can result in a decrease in the left atrium, resulting in some steady blood loss or left atrial appendage movement due to anemia

 a rhythm to control the rate one wants to do is usually lower than normal, without trying to change BPM 100-60
 Regular close that one wants to restore heart rate with controlled medications for cardioversion with regular heart rhythm and maintain it
 Studies suggest that the rhythm can be controlled
 Instrumentation is primarily a concern in the newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is more important in the chronic phase as far as death is concerned, voice tests showed that there is no treatment versus rhythm control treatment with statistical differences

 The theory of structural engineering is based on empirical knowledge related to physical laws and properties of various materials / geometries
 anekon chote chote sanrachanaatmak avyavon ke yoga se jatil sanrachanaayen nirmit kii jaatin hai
 a structural engineer should not only have the knowledge of iron and steel, but also have advanced knowledge of wood, brick, stone, lime and cement and should also be proficient in mechanical and electrical engineering work, because they are safe and secure according to the principles of their structure, mechanics and physics
 Have to make from bhoomi, jal or vaayu kii prakruti kaa bhi purna gyaan civil ejeeniyar ke samaan hi hona chahie
 Structural engineering was considered a department of civil engineering till the 19th century, but as the requirements of civil society changed and increased according to the circumstances, production and use of advanced types of iron, steel etc
 started to increase, so did mechanics Has progressed

 The design of each building requires roofs and floors for dharnas, scissors, pillars and a foundation built on the ground
 inkaa sangyojan hi makaan kaa 'dhaanchaa' he
 Whether the structure is for any building, bridge or crane, etc
, it is necessary to consider while constructing them that what kind of force and how much quantity of external force will fall on their various components

 Making the structure strong does not mean making its components very thick and heavy
 dhaanche kii banaavat main bal sahan karne kii kshamta honi chahie
 Such a structure is made by combining several triangles
 chaturbhujon or panchabhujon se bane dhaanche main itani kshamta nahin hoti
 The triangular frame is called scissors
 ye balon ke sahane ke drushtikon se sarvatha nirdosh or avyavon kii drushti se swat: purna hoti he
 Such scissors can be made for very long legs and can also be balanced on its own

 For large legs, triangular canes are very strong and very light and cheap

 Therefore, these burdens have to be estimated very carefully
 ye bojhe sadaiv ek se hi bane rahane ke kaaran achal bhaar kehalaate hai
 All vertical walls and sloping roofs are subjected to the vertical pressure caused by the side air, which is called air pressure and it comes in the count of moving load
 anek manzile makaanon kii madhyavarti chhaton par vahaan ke nivaasiyon or uthau fernichar kaa bhaar hi hota he lekin yah anya achal bhaaron kii apeksha naganya hota he
 The forces falling on different components of the structure are calculated according to the principle of force triangle or force polygons
 iske liye ejeeniyar "bau sanket" pranali kaa upyog karte hai
 This method is relatively simple
 balon kaa pariklan vishuddh ganit dwaara bhi sthitiki or trikonmiti kii sahaayta se kiya ja saktaa he
 To calculate in this way, assuming an appropriate point to be the center of the pulverizer, equate the rotating force of unknown force falling in any component of the structure
 jitne hi adhik bade paat kii chat kii kanchi athwa pul kaa kanchinuma garder anaaya jaataa he usamen utane hi adhik sankhya main chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yahi baat kainchiyon ko bal sahan karne yogya uchit aakaar ke chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yah baat kainchiyon ke thaamon par bhi lagu hoti he
 Therefore, the scissors are divided into small triangles of appropriate size to withstand the force
 dhaanchaa par jo boj padate hai use bhaar kehete hai
 Movable and fixed loads are mentioned above
 yadi bhaar kisi thodi si jagah par kendrit he, to use kendrit bhaar or yadi puure avyavon par failaa ho, to use vibhajit bhaar kehete hai
 The load of the vehicles, trains, motors, trucks, etc
, is called the load and the load coming from one direction and immediately after the other direction is called the load with the alternating load and the impact load
 padaarthon kaa pratibal bhi hota he
 Stress, compression, shear, cramps etc
 can be stress due to the condition and tendency of the load
 pratibal ke prabhaav se jo parivartan hota he use vikruti kehete hai
 Substances have the property of elasticity, less in some and less in some and more in some
 pratyasthata kii seemaa hoti he
 Substances that exceed the limit are broken
 hook ne san 1676 main ek niyam sthapit kiya ki yadi prayek padaarth par uski pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar bal lagaaya jaae, to uske kaaran padanevaala pratibal tathaa us padaarth main honevaali vikruti main ek vishesh anupaat hoga
 In 1826, Dr
 Young definitively ascertained the proportions of deformations in various substances due to stresses falling within the range of elasticity
 ise yang kaa pratyasthata mapank kehete hai
 The tensile and compression ratios are expressed by the E, shear ratios C, or the letter g and the volume ratios are expressed by the k letter: pratyaksh pratyasthata mapank Transverse elasticity modulus sampeden se padaarthon kaa aaytan ghat jaataa he
 Thus, the elastic elasticity modulus tapochar tathaa yantropchaar se pratyasthata mapaankon main parivartan ho jaaya karata he
 If a solid rod is pulled, we see that it breaks thinly in the middle and if it is pulled by applying force within the range of elasticity, its lateral measurement becomes smaller as it increases in length
 
 isi prakaar yadi kisi chad ko dabaaya jaae, to uski parshvik naap bad jaati he
 Therefore, the change in the lateral measurements of a direct solid due to stretch or pressure is in proportion to the Poisson
 ise m akshar se vyakt karte hai
 a pure mismatch is in the form of a mixture of stresses, two materials and each other acting in opposite directions
 inaki kriya rekha bhi ek duusare se samakon par hoti he
 If one end of the axle is firmly tightened in the wall and the other end is applied with force, the other end will be slightly bent
 mula rekha se jitna kone, dd banaakar vah mudata he vah kone uskaa anthan kone hoga
 With the help of this angle the spasm force of axle can be removed
 ejiniyari main kaam aanevaali samagriyon kaa pareekshan atyaavashyak he
 Placing them under the same conditions as the materials used, should be tested
 pareekshan do prakaar se hota he : ek raasayanik reeti se samagriyon ke aanvik sanghathan kaa gyaan hota he or bhautik reeti se khinchakar, dabaakar, aparupan kar, panch se chhedakar, jhukaa kar tathaa modakar dekha jaataa he ki unke sahan karne kii samta kisi he
 Nowadays, a device has been made to test the material in physical way, which is called Hounsfield tensometer
 isaki kaarypaddati badi saral he or saamaanya vyakti bhi thode se prashikshan se iskaa upyog kar saktaa he
 With this, knowledge of the strength of materials, load distortion, abstinence etc
 is easily achieved
 jab tak kisi padaarth par padanevaale pratibal us padaarth kii pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar rahata he, tab tak vikruti badi sookshm yaa asthaayee hoti he
 As soon as the weight is removed, that substance returns to its original state
 par yadi pratibal pratyasthata kii seemaa ke upar ho, to vikruti paryaapt ore adhik sthaayee hoti he
 The fraction weight is much higher than the limit of elasticity, but in terms of trade and utility, this weight is kept low and is called the point of defeat and it is considered as the differential weight
 pratyasthata kii seemaa sahane yogya bhaar se bhi kaaphi kam maatra main bhaar daalane kii yojana, abhiklpana ke samay kii jaati he
 Therefore, the ratio in which this practical load is less than the most bearable load, that ratio is called the Abbey Coefficient or Depressor of that substance
 ise nimnlikhit sutara se vyakt kiya jaataa he : Representatives of different substances are different in different states
 kathor ispaat kaa abhayank sthir bhaar main teen tathaa chal bhaar main paanch se aath or prayavarti chal bhaar main nau se 13 tak hota he
 The hardness of materials can easily be estimated by their stress, compression, contouring, etc
 forces
 kathorta pareekshan kii aadhunik vidhiyaan, sthitik danturata or gatyaatmak danturata ke siddhanton par aadhaarit hai
 Are based on static dentistry theory
 sthitik danturata siddhant par aadhaarit hai
 Brinell's hardness-test-method based on static dentistry theory, according to which a part of the test substance is polished finely like glass, and is pressed on it with standard weights by instruments by placing a bullet of very hardened steel, standard diameter
 isse polish kii hui sataha par gol nishaan pad jaataa he
 By measuring the diameter of the mark, remove the hardness of the bullet according to the following formula: yadi goli kaa vyas d or nishaan kaa vyas d mimi
 hoti to Joe Krigra Per square mm It is written in saadharantaya goli kaa vyas 10 mimi
 or lohe tathaa ispaat ke liye 3,000 kigra
, pital aadi mulaayam dhaatuon ke liye 1,000 kriga
 or sis aadi bahut mulaayam dhaatu ke padaarthon ke liye 50 kriga
 maanak bhaar rakhaa jaataa he
 The weight is usually kept so that the diameter of the mark does not exceed 3 / 8 of the diameter of the bullet
 pareekshan kisi bhi vyas kii goli se kiya ja saktaa he, par daab or goli ke vyas kaa anupaat, p / , ek sa rahanaa chahie
 a steel bullet is used for general hardness and a diamond bullet for high hardness
 kathor padaarthon par 15 second tak or mulaayam padaarthon par 30 second tak bhaar diya jaataa he
 There is a system of finely measuring the mark
 wickers vidhi se bhi kathortank nikaala jaataa he
 In this place, Hirakni is used in the form of a square pyramid in place of bullet

 The Russian Revolution of 1917 is one of the most important events in world history
 iske parinamswaroop rus se zaar ke swechhachari shashan kaa ant hua tathaa roosi soviet sanghatmak samaajawaadee ganraajya kii sthapana hui
 This revolution took place in two parts - in March 1917, and in October 1917
 pehali kranti ke falswaroop samraat ko pad-tyaag ke liye vivash hona padaa tathaa ek asthaayee sarkaar bani
 As a result of the October Revolution, the Provisional Government was replaced by a temporary government
 1917 kii roosi kranti beesvin sadi ke vishwa itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana rahi
 France's state revolution in 1789 AD affected Europe's life on a deeper level by propagating the spirit of freedom, equality and brotherhood
 roosi kranti kii vyapaktaa ab tak kii sabhi raajnneetik ghatnaon kii tulana main bahut vistrut thi
 It not only brought an end to autocratic, monarchical, autocratic, czarist rule but ended the economic and social power of the elite landlords, feudalists, capitalists etc
 and established the first power of workers and peasants in the world
 marks dwaara pratipaadit vaigyanik samaajwaad kii vichaardhaara ko moort rup pehali baar roosi kranti ne pradaan kiya
 This revolution established the socialist system and established itself as the father of this system
 yah vichaardhaara 1917 ke pashchaat itani shaktishaalee ho gai ki 1950 tak lagbhag aadha vishwa iske antargat aa chukaa tha
 The world history after the revolution was dynamic in some way that it was either in favor of its spread or against its spread
 rus kii kranti kaa mahatv na keval europe ke itihaas main varan vishwa ke itihaas main he
 Just as the most important event in the history of the 18th century is the State Revolution of France, similarly the most important event of the twentieth century was the Bolshevik Revolution of Russia in 1917 AD
 rus main saamaajik samanta kaa nitant abhaav tha
 At this time, the entire society of Russia was divided into three different categories, in which there was no goodwill among themselves
 ve ek duusare ko apane se purnataya bhinn or pruthak samajhati thim
 Czar Nicholas was an absolute autocratic and autocratic ruler
 yah janata ko kisi prakaar kaa adhikaar pradaan karne ke paksh main nahin tha
 The following reasons of the Russian Revolution of 1917 were- anya deshon ke samaan rus main bhi audyogic kranti hui, yadhyapi yahaan par kranti anya deshon kii apeksha kaaphi samay ke uparaant hui kintu iske hone par rus main bahut se kaarkaanon kii sthapana ho gai thi
 Thus began the industrialization of Russia
 isamen kaam karne ke kaaran lakhon kii sankhya main majdoor dehaton or gaanvon kaa parityag kar un nagaron tathaa shaharon main nivas karne lage, jinamein kal kaarkaanon kii sthapana hui thi
 Due to residing in cities and cities, they were no longer as simple as before
 nagaron main rahane se unamem na keval chalata-poorjaapan hi aa gaya tha, apitu ye raajnneetik maamalon main bhi ruchi lene lage the
 He also took note of his political and social rights
 inhone apane klbon kaa nirmaan kiya, jahaan ye sab prakaar ke maamalon par vichaar karte the or aapas main vaad-vivaad karte the
 He also got knowledge of new ideologies and trends by staying here
 inhone shramik sanghathanon kii sthapana bhi kerani aarambhn There was a revolution in Russia in 1905, by which an attempt was made to establish a legal monarchy in Russia, but due to mutual quarrels, this revolution could not succeed and the rule was re-established
 is kranti kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki usne rus kii saadhaaran janata ko raajnneetik adhikaron kaa parichay kara diya tha
 He came to know what the meaning of the vote is? How should members of Parliament be elected in Duma or in other words? The government should decide its policy according to the public opinion and move forward to do the works of public interest
 apane raajnneetik adhikaron se parichit ho jane ke kaaran rus kii janata samaj gai ki rus main bhi purnataya loktantr shashan kii sthapana honi chaiye jahaan saadhaaran janata ke haath main shashan satta ho
 The democracy states of Western Europe also had an impact on Russia, although the emperors of Russia made special efforts to stop the propagation of Western progressive ideas in Russia, but it is very difficult to stop the ideas, because ideas are like air
 
 pratham vishwayuddh ke samay germany or uske saathiyon ke viruddh jo prachaar-kaary mitra rashtron kii ore se kiya ja rahaa tha, usamen mukhyatah yahi kaha jaataa tha ki ve loktantr shashan, janata kii swatantraaa or rashtriyata ke aadhaar par naveen rashtron kaa nirmaan karne ke abhipraay se yuddh kar rahe hai
 Russia was under the Allies
 atah vahaan kii janata par bhi is prachaar kaa bahut asar padaa
 Education was promoted in Russian to middle-class individuals
 jis prakaar france kii kranti kaa shrey france ke darshanik, shikshit varg aadi ko praapt he usee prakaar rus main bhi kranti kaa veg isi shrenee ke logon ne teevr kiya

 Many Asian writers also presented new and progressive ideas through their texts

 a feeling was awakened in his heart that it is his duty to make great efforts to upgrade his country
 mahayuddh main rus mitra rashtron kii ore se sammilit hua
 His large army demonstrated great ability and competence at the start of the war, but after two years of continuous fighting, the signs of laxity were clearly visible in it
 rus kii sena bahadur avashya thi, kintu usamen desh-bhakthi or rashtriyata kii ve bhaavnaayen vidyaman nahin thi, jo apurv tyaag or mar mitane ke liye prerana pradaan karti hai
 Russian armies were recruited to meet the numbers
 unamem vir sainikon kii parampara avashya thi, par unke sammukh koi adarsh vishesh nahin tha
 This was the condition of Russia's bureaucracy
 rus ke karmchaaree yah nahin samajhate the ki ve desh kii unnati or raashtra seva ke liye niyukt kiye gayi hai
 His ideal was to please the emperor and occupy high positions
 jab vishwayuddh lambaa hota gaya or do varsh kii ladaai ke uparaant bhi vijay ke koi chinh prakat nahin hue to rus kii sena or naukarshahi ghabara uthi
 Bribery, corruption etc
 had already attained their climax in Russia
 garib logon ke liye guzar kar sakna asambhav ho gaya tha
 Finally, on 7 March 1917, the public's condition became very miserable
 uske paas na pahanane ko kapadaa tha or na khaane ko anaaj tha
 She was distraught with hunger and clothes
 pareshaan hokar bhukhe or thand se thithurate hue garib or majaburon ne 7 march din petrogred kii sadakon par ghoomana aarambh kiya
 Bread shops were piled with fresh and hot rotis
 bhukhi janata kaa man taaji or garam chaay va rotiyon ko dekhakar lalachaa gaya or vah apane aapako niyantran main nahin rakh saki
 They started looting in the market
 sarkaar ne sena ko un par goli chalaane kaa aadesh diya ki vah goli chalaakar luutmaar karne waalon ko teetar-bitar kar de, kintu sainikon ne goli chalaane se saaf manaa kar diya kyonki unako janata se sahanubhuti thi
 The spirit of revolution had entered them as well
 jab mazdooron ne yah dekha ki sainik un par goli chalaane ko taiyaar nahin hai, to unka saahas bahut bad gaya
 Hence, the revolution had become inevitable now
 duusari ore duma ne visarjeet hone se manaa kar diya
 It was compromised by the Petrograd Soviet, on the basis of which a social government was established on 14 March 1917 AD under the chairmanship of the liberal leader George Slavin
 usne 14 march ko jaar se shashan kaa parityag karne kii maang kii
 Bounded by the situation, he accepted his demand and resigned from the government
 is prakaar rus main jaarshahi kaa ant hua
 The workers were successful in the revolution, but they did not think it appropriate to keep the reins of governance in their hands, and handed over all the power to the middle class

 Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade was an Indian judge, writer and social reformer of the British era
 rande nasik, maharashtra ke ek chote se kasbe nifaad main paidaa hue the
 He was born in Nimphad and spent the early years in Kolhapur, where his father was a minister
 inaki shiksha mumbai ke elfinstone college main chaudaa varsh kii aayu main armbh huai thi
 These are both from Bombay University; And passed the first class in law postgraduate courses)
 san 1897 main rande us samiti main bhi sevarat rahe, jise shahi evam prantiy vyay kaa lekha jokha rakhane evam aarthik katautiyon kaa anumodan karne kaa kaarybhaar mila tha
 For this service, he received the status of Companion of the Order of Indian Empire
 inhone san 1887 se da deccan agriculchrists relif act ke antargat vishesh nyaayadhish ke padbhaar ko bhi sambhala
 Ranade was from a staunch Chitpavan Brahmin family
 unka janm nimphad main hua or aarmabhik kaal unhone kolhapur main bitaayaa, jahaan unke pita mantri the
 After the death of his first wife, his reformers wanted him to marry a widow and save her
 parantu, unhone apane parivaar kaa maan rakhte hue, ek balika, ramabai ranade se vivaah kiya, jise baad main unhone shikshit bhi kiya
 After his death, his wife undertook his educational and social reforms
 unke koi santan nahin thi
 ---> apane mitron doytmaram pandurang, bal mangesh vaagle evam vaaman abaaji modak ke sang, ranade ne prarthana-samaaj kii sthapana kii, jo ki brahmo samaaj se prerit ek hinduvadi andolan tha
 It was based on the principles of published theism, which was based on the ancient Vedas
 prarthana samaaj maharashtra main keshav chandra sen ne armbh kiya tha, jo ek drudh brahmasamaji the
 It was originally committed to bring religious reforms in Maharashtra
 ranade saamaajik sammelan andolan ke bhi sansthaapak the, jise unhone mrityu paryant samarthan diya, jiske dwaara unhone samaaj sudhaar, jaise bal vivaah, vidhwaa mundan, vivaah ke aadambaron par baari aarthik vyay, sagarpar yatra par jaateey pratibandh ityadi kaa virodh kiya
 He laid full emphasis on widow remarriage and female education
 ranade ne pune saarvajanik sabha kii sthapana kii or baad main bhartiya rashtriya congress ke sansthaapakon main se ek bane
 He was always shown as a former opponent of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and a trusted advisor to Gopal Krishna Gokhale
 1911 ke britannika vishwakosh ke anusaar, puna saarvajanik sabha, praayah sarkaar kii yuktipurna salahon se, sahaayta karti rahi he
 In a letter to Henri Fossett, Florence Nightengale wrote: 1943 main, babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar ne, ranade kii prashansa kii, evam unhen gandhi or jinah ke virdohi kaa darja diya
 Ranade has written many articles and books on social, religious, economic and political subjects
 in rachanaaon ko anek sheershakon se sankalit kiya gaya he
 His articles titled "ranade's Economical Writing" have been edited by Vipin Chandra which was published by Gyan Books Private Limited based in New Delhi
 yah siddh karne ke liye ki unke vichaar shastron ke purnat: anuroop the, unhone vidvattapurna granth likhe, jaise 'vidhwaaon ke punarvivaah ke samarthan main veda' or 'bal vivaah ke viruddh shastron kaa mat
 ' ranade 19veen sadi ke bhartiya sudhaarwadi the
 He was opposed to revivalism
 punarutthanavaad kii simaaon ko rekhaankit karte hue unhone apane ek lekh main likhaa tha ki- There is nothing exuberant and extravagant in Ranade
 He refused to reap cheap notoriety by playing the part of an extremist
 He refused to mislead people by playing upon and exploiting the patriotic sentiments of the people
 He refused to be a party to methods which are crude, which have volume but no effect, and which are neither fool-proof nor knave-proof, and which break the back even of the most earnest and sincere servants of the country and disable them from further effort
 In short, Ranade was like the wise captain who knows that his duty is not to play with his ship clever and masterful tricks, just for effect and show in the midst of the ocean, but to take it safely to its appointed port
 In short, Ranade was not a forged bank note and in worshipping him we have no feeling of kneeling before anything that is false

 In developed countries, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers, who donate blood for community supplies
 garib deshon main, sthapit aapurti simit hai or aamtaur par parivaar yaa mitron ke liye aadhaan kii jarurat hone par hi raktadata rakt diya karte hai
 Many donors donate blood in the form of donations, but some are paid and in some cases incentives are given in the form of paid vacation during work hours instead of money
 koi daata apane bhavishya ke upyog ke liye rakt daan kar saktaa he
 Blood donation is relatively safe, but some donors get scratched at the point where the needle is inserted or some people may feel fainter
 sambhavit daataaon kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he taaki unke khun kaa upyog asurakshit na rahe
 Investigations include testing for diseases such as HIV and viral hepatitis that can be transmitted through blood transfusions
 daata se uske chikitsa itihaas ke bare main bhi poocha jaataa he or daata ke swasthya par daan se koi kshatikaarak prabhaav nahin pade, yah sunishchit karne ke liye uski ek sankshipt shaareerik jaanch kii jaati he
 The number of times a donor can donate can vary over days and months, depending on what he is donating or doing and in which country the donation is being made
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main ek daata ko purna rakt daanon ke bich 8 hafte kaa intjaar karnaa padataa he, lekin plateletferosis daanon ke liye sirf teen dinon kaa
 The amount and manner of blood given can vary, but an ideal donation is 450 milliliters of whole blood
 ise menuali yaa swachaalit upkaran se sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki keval khun ke vishisht bhaag ko letaa he
 Most of the blood components used for transfusion have a short fixed life and maintaining a constant supply is a permanent problem
 sangrahit rakt ko koun praapt karegaa, is par rakt daan ko samoohon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 An allogeneic donation is called when a donor gives blood for storage to a blood bank for transfusion of an unknown person
 ek nirdeshit daan use kehete hai jab koi vyakti, aksar ek paariwarik sadsy, kisi vyakti vishesh ke aadhaan ke liye rakt daan karata he
 Guided donations are relatively rare
 ek pratisthaapan daata daan do kaa ek mishran he or ghana jaise vikasshil deshon main aam he
 In this case, the recipient's friend or family member donates blood to use the stored blood to replace the blood used in the transfusion to ensure a continuous supply of blood
 jab ek vyakti kaa rakt sangrahit kar liya jaataa he or use baad main daankarta ko waapas chadha diya jaataa he, aamtaur par surgery ke baad, to yah autologus kehalaata he
 Allogeneic donation or donations made specifically for the manufacture of the drug can be used to make the drug
 vaastavik prakriya desh ke kanoonon ke anusaar badalati rahati he or daataaon ke liye anushansa rakt ikattha karanevaale alag-alag sanghathan ke hisaab se badalati rahati he
 The World Health Organization has provided recommendations for blood donation policies, but developing countries are not following many of them
 udhaaharan ke liye, pareekshan ke liye prayogshaala kii suvidhaon, prashikshit karmchaaree or visheshgy abhikarmakon kii aavashyaktaa kii anushansa kii gayi he, vikasshil deshon main ho saktaa he ye sab uplabdh na hon yaa bahut hi mahange hon
 Programs where donors give allogenic blood are sometimes called blood drives or blood donation sessions
 aise kaarykram rakt bank main ho sakate hai, lekin aksar ye log iskaa aayojan kisi saamudayik sthaan jaise shouping centre, kaarysthal, vidhyalay yaa puja sthal main karte hai
 This entire process usually requires donors to consent and this requirement means that minors cannot donate without the permission of their parent or guardian
 In some countries, to maintain anonymity, the answer is associated with the donor's blood, not the blood donor's name; But in some other countries, such as the United States, names are placed to make lists of ineligible donors
 yadi ek sambhavit daata in mandandon ko puraa nahin karte hai to unhen vilambit kar diya jaataa he
 The term is used because many donors who are ineligible may later be allowed to donate blood
 daata kii nasl yaa jaateey prishthbhumi kabhi-kabhi mahatvapurn ho jaati he, chunki kabhi kabhi kuch rakt ke prakaar, khaastaur par durlabh kism ke rakt, kinhin jaateey samooh main bahut aam hote hai
 Historically, donors were separated based on race, religion, or ethnicity, but no longer do so
 swasthya jokhim ke liye daataaon kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he kyonki ho saktaa he praapak ke liye vah daan asurakshit ho
 Some such restrictions are controversial, such as a ban on blood donation from men who have sex with a man at risk of HIV
 chunki daata vahi vyakti he jo rakt kaa praapak hoga isiilie daataaon kii suraksha samasya ke liye autologus daataaon kii jaanch hameshaa nahin hoti he
 Donors are also questioned about drug intake, especially dicastride, as it can be dangerous for the receiving pregnant woman
 aisi bimariyon, jaise echivi, malaria yaa viral hepatatis jinka sankraman rakt aadhaan ke madhyam se ho saktaa he, ke sanket va lakshanon ke liye rakt daataaon kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 During the test, questions can also be asked about risk factors for various diseases, such as travel to a country where there is a risk of malaria or variant creutzfeldeit-jacob disease
 ye sawaal alag-alag desh main bhinn hote he
 For example, Quebec, Poland, and the US may delay donors who lived in the United Kingdom at risk of vcjd, while the United Kingdom only has restrictions on donors who are at risk of vcjd if they have had a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom
 
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki raktadan uske swasthya ke liye khatarnaak na ho, daata kaa bhi pareekshan hota he or uske chikitsa itihaas ke bare main bhi kuch sawaal puche jate hai
 Hematocrit or or hemoglobin levels of the donor are tested to ensure that blood transfusions will afflict them with anemia and this test is very common to disqualify a donor
 nabj raktchaap or sharir kaa taapmaana kaa bhi moolyankan kiya jaataa he

iske alaava crossmatch sahit anya pareekshan, aadhaan se pehle aamtaur par kiye jate hai
 Group o is often referred to as a "universal donor", but is only allowed for transfusion of red cells
 plasma ke aadhaan ke liye pranali vipareet ho jaati he or abi saarvbhaumik daata ho jaataa he
 Mostly blood is tested for various diseases including some stds
 pareekshan main ucch-samvedansheel screening test kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he or koi vaastavik nidaan nahin hota he
 Some test results are later found to be false positives when even more specific tests are used
 farji rinatmak virale hi hote hai, lekin daataaon ko anjaan etidi screening ke kaaran rakt daan karne se hatotsahit kiya jaataa he, kyonki ek farji rinatmak hone ke matlab ikai kaa dooshit ho janaa he
 If the test is positive, that blood is destroyed, but there are some exceptions; Such as autologous blood donation
 The donor is usually informed of the test result
 daan kiye gaye rakt kaa kai tarah se pareekshan kiya jaataa he, lekin vishwa swasthya sanghathan dwaara chaar mukhya pareekshan sujhaaye gaye hai: In 2006 the WHO stated that the survey found that 124 out of 56 countries are not using basic testing in all blood donations

 There are two main ways of receiving blood from the donor
 aparivartit rakt ke rup main sidhe shira se zyaadaatar rakt le liya jaataa he
 This blood is usually divided into separate parts, mostly red blood cells and plasma, as more and more recipients need only a specific component
 anya tarika daata se rakt lene kaa he, isamen ek apkendritra yaa ek filter kaa upyog kar ise alag kar vaankshit hisson ko sanchit kar liya jaataa he or baaki daata ko waapas de diya jaataa he
 This process is called apheresis and is often done through a machine specially designed for this
 sidhe rakt aadhaan ke liye shira kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, lekin badale main rakt dhamni se liya ja saktaa he
 In this case, blood is not accumulated, but is pumped directly from the donor into the recipient
 rakt aadhaan kaa yah purana tarika he or aaj ke samay main shaayad hi kabhi iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 When doctors returned to civilian life after logistics and treatment of wounded soldiers, it was phased out during World War II due to the problem of establishing a bank for accumulated blood
 lambey haath kii twachaa ke najdiki shira se rakt liya jaataa he, aamtaur par kohni ke bheetar madhyika prakoshti shira se
 twachaa ke bacteria se sanchit rakt ko dooshit hone se rokane or saath main daata kii twachaa main jahaan sooyee lagaayi jaati he vahaan se sankraman ke rokthaam ke liye rakt vahika ke upar kii twachaa ko iodine yaa chlorhexidine jaise antiseptic se saaf kiya jaataa he

 The donor can also be told to hold an object in hand or to tighten the fist, by doing this again and again the blood flow in the vein increases
 daata shira se ek container main rakt ekatrit karnaa sabase aam tarika he
 The amount of blood expelled varies from 200 ml to 550 ml depending on the country, but usually 450–500 ml
 rakt aamtaur par lacheele plastic kii thili main sangrahit kiye jate hai, jisamen sodium citrate, phosphate, dextroj or kabhi-kabhi adenine bhi hota he
 This combination prevents and protects blood from clotting during storage
 anya rasayan kabhi kabhi prasanskaran ke dauraan jode jate hai
 Plasma from unchanged blood can be used to make plasmas for transfusion, or by fractionation and processing, it can be used to make other drugs
 sookhe plasma kaa viksit rup he, jiskaa istemaal dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan jakhmon kaa ilaaj karne main kiya gaya or iskaa bhinn rup ab bhi vibhinn kism ke aushadhi banane main kiya jaataa he
 Apheresis is a method of blood donation, where blood passes through a device that separates a particular component and the remaining components are returned to the donor
 aamtaur par lautya janevaala ghatak laal rakt koshikaayen hoti hai, jitani maatra main rakt liya jaataa he use waapas karne main lanbaa samay lag jaataa he
 Using this method, a person can safely donate plasma or platelet as much as possible, rather than by unchanged blood donation
 Both can be combined with a donor donating both plasma and platelets in a single donation
 bimbaanu ko bhi aparivartit rakt se alag kiya ja saktaa hai, lekin ve bahut saare daanon se ikattha kiya janaa chahie
 The therapeutic dose requires three to ten units of blood
 plateletferosis prayek daan se kam se kam ek purna khuraaq pradaan karata he
 Plasmapheresis is frequently used to collect plasma sources, which are used in the manufacture of drugs, like plasmas from unchanged blood

 The range of recovery benefits in that study was 20 to 59 days
 aise pratisthapana kii dar kaa aadhaar is baat par hota he ki daata kitni baar rakt de saktaa he
 Plasmapheresis and plateletpheresis can be given repeatedly to the donor, as they do not reduce the amount of the most important red blood cells
 The exact rate of how often a donor can donate varies from country to country
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main plazmaferesis daata ko ek saptaah main do baar badi maatra main daan karne kii anumati he or saal main saamaanya taur par 83 litre de sakate hai, jabik yahi daata japan main har ek vaikalpik saptaah ke baad daan de saktaa he or saal main 16 litre daan de saktaa he
 Red blood cells are limited to the unchanged blood donor, so there is a wide difference in the frequency of donation
 hong kong main yah teen se chah maheene main banataa he, australia main yah baarah saptaah main, sanyukt rajya america main yah aath saptaah main or britain main yah aamtaur par solah saptaah main, lekin yah baarah se kam ho saktaa he

 is parshv prabhaav ko rokane ke liye rakt daan ke dauraan daataaon ko kabhi-kabhi calcium anupoorak diya jaataa he
 In apheresis procedures, red blood cells often return
 agar yah minial rup se kiya jaataa he or kisi alag vyakti se daata rakt praapt karata he, tab ek aadhaan pratikriya ho sakati he
 Because of this risk, manual apheresis is very rare in the developed world and automated procedures are as safe as whole blood donation
 rakt daataaon ke liye antim jokhim aise upkaran hote hai jinhen visankramit nahin kiya gaya ho
 In most cases, devices that come in direct contact with blood are discarded
 1990 ke dashak main china main phir se istemaal kiye jane vaale upkaran ek badi samasya the, kyonki 250,000 tak rakt plasma daata aise upkarnon se echivi se peedit hue ho sakate hai

 mujhe acchhee tarah se yaad he
 Very well As if the curry on the psyche is deep


 indelible and unforgettable


 covered with invisible but dense sensations


 as if the eyelids are full of the feeling of the pupil
 gaanv kii mitti apanepan kii gandh se


kaliyaan madhur suvaas se


maanas-jhil mithe-sunahale sapanom se or jaise sanchetana rasi-pagi rahati he, komal anubhutiyon se

 haa, mujhe yaad he, thik-thik yaad he ki varshon pehle maine hi kahin likhaa tha, suranjan or unki kavita, donon ke antahsambandh ke bare main
 yah ki donon main bhed karne kii jarurat nahin
 suranjan ko samajhnaa he to uski kavitaaon main utaro
 ruukhaa, sookhaa, bhavuk, samvedansheel, kunthit, yahaan tak ki swaarthee or parapidak, meetha-kadava or kirkira bhi
 suranjan kaa prayek rup, unka anoothaa vyaktitv, uski prayek chhavi, khamiyaan-khubiyaan unki kavitaaon main kaid he
 Very transparent and clear
 suranjan ne yun to kahani or upanyaas bhi likhe hai, kintu unki pahchaan ek kavi kii he
 Suranjan himself also considers himself a poet
 lekin kavi ve romaaniat ke hai
 The reason for this may also be that the poetry of the poetry within them was not due to any social or moral commitment, or a strong impulse of intellectualism
 na hi ve bahut padhate-likhte srujanaatmakataa ke dabaav ke kaaran kavi bane han
 kavita uske man main mukesh ke dard-bhare geeton or lata ke swar-maadhurya se janmi he
 Film songs and music can make someone a poet-litterateur, you can hardly believe this
 Before this i too did not have to
 suranjan ko dekhakar janaa ki aisa bhi sambhav he
 Though there are limits to excessive sentimentality, so too are Suranjan's poets
 aap unki bahut-si kavitaaon ko nakaar sakate hai
 But the poems in which his condolences have been broken by breaking all the embankments, you can accuse them of personalism and cannot deny them
 Suranjan still considers Mukesh his mentor without any intellectual inhumanity
 or preranarot bhi
 suranjan or unki kavita kii antarangta ko lekar jo maine varshon pehle kaha tha, aaj bhi usee par kaayam hum
 jabaki is bich dharti suraj kii hajaaron parikramaayen kar chuki he
 Everlasting Sadanira like Hindon and Yamuna, but today, polluted rivers have washed away millions of tons of waste
 khud suranjan ke bhi ujadane or basane silsilaa chalaa he
 They returned to Gaya after selling everything, house, shop, saying that Gaya's soil was calling them
 unka bholaa man samaj hi nahin paaya tha ki varshon pehle gaya se palaayan karne se lekar ab tak phalgu nadi main athaah pani bah chukaa he
 So when Gaya arrived with wife and children, the circumstances had completely changed
 dubaara jad jamaane kii koshish main sahityarath kii shuruyaat kiiμpustakon kii chalati-phirti dukaan
 graahakon ko lubhaane ke liye ‘hanuman chalisa’ kii pratiyaan muft bantee
 par halaat vipareet the
 Therefore, with new aspirations, new dreams, new hopes, the road to Delhi had to be held again
 Suranjan's life is still the same today, as it was twenty years ago, amidst heavy ups and downs, endless ups and downs with the eternal struggle
 is lambey antaraal main suranjan ko lekar meri raay jyon kii tyon he
 Not because my concepts are victims of inertia and status quoism
 samiksha-punariksha kaa daur unamem aayaa hi nahin he
 My concern is that even today Suranjan has not been able to recover from his stubbornness and repugnance
 unki kunthaayen aaj bhi jas kii tas hai
 In the meantime, their work and frustrations have taken even more serious flights
 iske baavjood jo nahin badla, vah he suranjan kii teevr bhavukta, jo unke kavitv kii aatma, jidon kaa avlamban he
 Meanwhile, there has been continuity between us in connection with introduction and unfamiliarity
 aparichay kaa daur haalanki chota he, lekin mere liye mahatvapurn bhi vahi he
 Perhaps my thinking behind this is that with complete introduction we are not able to know anyone fully
 To reach the untouched aspects of a person, to understand them, to understand, to understand, there is a need for a gap of unfamiliarity
 yani mujhe itnaa samay mila he ki main suranjan ke prati apni dharna kii punariksha kar sakuun
 unke prati man main jo anuraag jamaa he, jo dwaish jad jamaaye hue hai, unpar punarvichaar kar sakuun
 or aisa maine kiya bhi he
 Only on the basis of my unfamiliarity can i claim that my comments have enough potential for truth
 suranjan ko lekar main yadi khaasaa nirmam ho sakaa hum to is aparichay ke kaaran hi
 maansik dharaatal kii dooriyaan, yani aparichay kii avasthaa sambhawatah suranjan ke saath bhi he
 Whenever he got an opportunity to be ruthless towards me, he used it without giving up
 yah sthiti ai to ve aage bhi nahin chukange
 bina laag-lapet khari-khari kahenge
 balki aise maukey to vah nikaalte hi rahete hai
 Sometimes directly, through dialogue, sometimes under the pretext of poetry
 If she is angry then the anger becomes painful
 kuch varsh pehle uski naaraazgi se vaasta padaa tha
 Here i will not go to the bottom of the reasons for resentment
 This article also does not have this purpose
 un dinon suranjan ne mujhapar ek kavita likhi thi
 Don't know what the poem was like, how it was
 Neither Suranjan ever told me, nor did i request him
 shaayad isliye ki apane bare main kadavi-khari baaten sunne kaa saahas viralon main hi hota he, uskaa mujhamen abhaav tha
 Or perhaps thinking that there was nothing worth knowing in that poem
 In the mood in which Suranjan wrote that poem on me, or the expression he wanted to express through me through his poem, euphemism would have helped to give artistic height to the composition
 But Suranjan's hand is tight in the satire
 aise main kavita dil kii bhadaas athwa kuntha ke aaveg ke atirikt shaayad hi or kuch ho
 kam se kam mujhe to yahi laga tha
 a few days later, as Suranjan himself pointed out, he took the title of the poem from my own satirical novel 'jug-jug Jeevau Corruption'
 naaraazgi ke daur main vah kavita unhone hamaare kai doston ko sunai thi
 But i could never taste him
 Possible to avoid unpleasant situation in mind
 That is why i neither requested Suranjan to recite the poem nor showed interest in learning about the poetry of friends who had heard it
 vah kavita suranjan kii baaki saikadon anchhapi kavitaaon ke bich aaj bhi dhul chaat rahi hogi
 sthiti ko phase karne kaa yah bhi ek tarika he, jiskaa main jab-tab upyog karata rahata hum
 suranjan bhi is bare main kuch kamjor nahin hai
