 lavan ke kuch kaarkaane kharaghoda main is aashay se sthapit kiye gaye hai ki is bitern se magnesium chloride praapt kiya jaae jo vipul maatra main sugamawa se mil saktaa he
 Salt is produced in large quantities from this source and production can be greatly increased

 yah vishwa kii ek pramukh bhashaa he | Open Shortest Path First Internet Protocol is a dynamic routing protocol used in networks
 vishesh rup se, yah ek link state rooting protocol he jo ek autonomas pranali main oparate karata he or interior getwe protocol samooh ke antargat aata he
 In RFC 2328 for ipv4 it is defined as OSPF Ver
2
 ipv6 ke liye apadet RFC5340 ke OSPF Ver
3 main die gaye hai
 OSPF is perhaps the most widely used interior gateway protocol used in networks of large business institutions
 IS-IS, ek or link state rooting protocol he, jo aam taur par bade sarvice proveader network main prayukt hota he
 The Border Gateway Protocol is the most commonly used exterior gateway protocol, which is the main protocol among various systems on the Internet
 BGP · DHCP · DNS · FTP · HTTP · IMAP · IRC · LDAP · MGCP · NNTP · NTP · POP · RIP · RPC · RTP · SIP · SMTP · SNMP · SOCKS · SSH · Telnet · TLS / SSL · XMPP · TCP · UDP · DCCP · SCTP · RSVP · ECN · IP · ICMP · icmpv6 · IGMP · ipsec · OSPF is an internal gateway protocol that sends Internet protocol packets entirely to a single routing domain
 yah uplabdh routers se link state soochna ikattha karata he tathaa network kaa ek topology maanchitr banaata he
 The topology defines the routing table in the Internet layer, which automatically determines the routing based on the IP address given in the IP datagram
 OSPF ko alag-2 lambaai kii sabanet masking or class-las inter domen rooting adress modelon kii sahaayta karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya tha
 OSPF quickly detects changes in topology such as link failures, etc
 and connects it to a new loop-less routing structure within seconds
 yah dijxtra elgorithm par aadhaarit paddati kaa upyog karke har root ke liye ek sabase choti path shrinkhalaa banaata he, jise shortest path first elgorithm ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The link state information is maintained on each router in the form of a link state database, which is a tree image of the entire network topology
 LSDB kii isi tarah kii pratiyaan samay samay par sabhi OSPF router ko data bhej kar apadet kii jaati hai
 The route tables created by OSPF routing policies are controlled by the cost factors associated with each routing interface
 cost fector ek router tak kii duuri, ek link kaa network thruput, yaa link kii uplabdhta or vishwasaneeyata, ho saktaa he jise ek sankhya ke rup main darshaya jaataa he
 It provides a dynamic process to balance the traffic load on routes with equal values
 ek OSPF network taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he, yaa prabandhan ko saral karne tathaa trephic tathaa sansadhano kaa sadupyog niojit karne ke liye rooting kshetron main purnvibhajit kiya ja saktaa he

 Each additional region must have a direct or virtual connection with the OSPF base area
 is tarah ke conection ek interconnecting router dwaara sthapit kiye jate hai jise aria border router ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 An ABR creates separate link state databases in each region and summarizes routes for all regions in a network
 OSPF TCP / IP transport protocol kaa prayog nahin karata, lekin ise IP datagrams main protocol nan 89 ke saath samajhaayaa gaya he
 This works in contrast to other routing protocols such as the Routing Information Protocol, or the Border Gateway Protocol
 OSPF trutiyon kaa pataa lagane tathaa sudhaar karne kaa kaary khud karata he
 OSPF uses multicast addressing to route routes over a broadcast network link

 multicast IP trephic kii rooting ke liye, OSPF multicast open shortest path first protocol kaa sahyog karata he, jaisaa ki RFC 1584 main bataaya gaya he
 The OSPF protocol works securely between routers using alternative authentication methods when running on ipv4, and only allows trusted routers to participate in routing
 ospfv3, jo ipv6 par chalata he, ab protocol-internal pramanikaran kaa samarthan nahin karata
 iske bajaay, yah ipv6 protocol suraksha par nirbhar karata he
 The third version of OSPF contains modifications for the implementation of the ipv4 protocol
 abhaasi links ke alaava, sabhi padosi exange ipv6link-local adressing kaa prayog karte hai
 The ipv6 protocol runs per link rather than being based on the subnet
 protocol ko multah swatantra protocol banane ke liye link-state vigyapanon tathaa hello discovery packets main se sabhi IP prifiks soochna hataa di gayi he
 Despite IP addressing in ipv6 up to 128 bits, the area and router identities are still based on 32-bit values
 routers ek hi broadcast domen main yaa point tu point telecommunication link main prayek sire par, sameepvarti router kaa pataa laga kar pratikriya karte hai
 This address occurs when routers see themselves in the Hello OSPF protocol packet
 ise tu ve state kaha jaataa he tathaa yah sarvaadhik buniyadi rishta he
 Routers in an Ethernet or frame relay network choose a designated router and a backup designated router that acts as a hub to reduce traffic between routers
 OSPF donon unicast or multicast kaa prayog "hello packet" bhejne or link state ko apadet karne ke liye karata he
 As a link state routing protocol, OSPF establishes relationships with other routers to receive / provide routing updates
 OSPF main padosi teble ko adjesency teble kaha jaataa he
 OSPF only makes connections with directly connected routers provided that OSPF is properly organized
 jin routers ke saath yah sambandh banaata he vah interphes ke saath samaan kshetra main hone chahiyein
 ek interphes sirf ek hi kshetra se sambandhit ho saktaa he
 An OSPF network is divided into regions that are labeled with a 32-bit region identity
 kshetra pahchaan chinh zyaadaatar ek ipv4 adress ke dot decimal notesan ke rup main likhe jate hai
 However, these are not IP addresses and can mimic any ipv4 address without difficulty
 OSPF ke ipv6 karyanvan ke liye kshetra pahchaanane ke liye bhi isi notesan main likhe 32-bit pahchaan chinhon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Although most ospfs will associate with other field numbers not written in dotted decimal format, it is always good to use dotted-decimal

 Areas are logical groups of hosts and networks, including routers connected by interfaces to the network
 prayek kshetra ek alag link state databes rakhata he saar jude hue router dwaara baaki network kii ore bheja ja saktaa he
 Thus the topology of a region remains unknown outside the region
 yah ek autonomas pranali ke bhaagon ke bich rooting trephic ko kam kar detaa he
 Several "special" field types are defined: bakabon kshetra ek OSPF network kaa pramukh hissaa he
 All other areas are connected to it and the inter area routing is done by routers connected to the backbone area and the areas connected to them
 yah 'OSPF domen' kii logical or shaareerik sanrachana he or OSPF domen main sabhi nonazero kshetron se judi he
 Note that the term autonomous system border router in OSPF is historical in the sense that multiple OSPF domains can coexist in the same Internet autonomous, RFC1996
 bakabon kshetra non bakabon kshetron ke bich rooting soochna ke vitaran ke liye jimmedaar he
 The backbone area should be nearby but they do not have to be around physically
 bakabon sampark abhaasi links ko niojit kar ke sthapit kiye ja sakate hai
 All OSPF areas must be connected to the backbone area
 However, this relationship can occur via a virtual link

 To be a transit area, a region must have transit characteristics, so it cannot be obstructive in any way
 rukaawat kshetra ek aisa kshetra he, jo bahari autonomas pranali se root vigyaapan praapt nahin karata tathaa kshetra ke bheetar hone vaali rooting puri tarah se ek difolt root par aadhaarit hoti he
 This reduces the size of the routing database of internal routers of the region
 rukaawat kshetron kii buniyadi avadharana main sanshodhan se kam rukaawat vaala kshetra bana he
 In addition, many customary changes have been implemented by system vendors, such as the fully obstructed area and the NSSA completely constrained area
 Both are extensions of the Cisco Systems routing tool
 ek kam rukaawat vaala kshetra rukaawat kshetra kaa ek prakaar he jo autonomas pranali ke bahari rooton ko pakad saktaa hai or unhen anya kshetron main bhej saktaa he, lekin phir bhi anya kshetron se AS bahari root praapt nahin kar saktaa
 NSSA rukaawat kshetra kaa vistrut rup he jo rukaawat kshetra main simit maatra main bahari rooton ko aane detaa he
 Creates what is known as type 7 that can only exist in an NSSA region
 ek NSSA ASBR is LSA ko utpann karata he or ek NSSA ABR router ise tip 5 LSA main roopantarit karata he jo OSPF domen main mil jaataa he
 An area may be simultaneously of less obstruction and total obstruction
 yah tab hota he jab kisi vyaavhaarik jagah par ek ASBR sampoorn rukaawat ke chor par rakhaa jaataa he
 For example - with a newly acquired company
 In such a case, ASBR sends the external routes to the entire interrupt area, and they are available to the OSPF speakers in that area
 cisco kiryanvan main bahari rooton ko sampoorn rukaawat kshetra main bhejne se pehle sarabaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 In general, ASBR should not launch TSA-NSSA, although with very careful design and operation, this may be the case in limited special cases in which such projection makes sense
 sampoorn rukaawat kshetra ko NSSA ke rup main ghoshit karne se, difolt root ke alaava bakabon se koi bahya root kshetra main pravesh nahin kar saktaa
 TSA-NSSA ke dwaara bahya root 0
0
0
0 kshetra pahonchte hai lekin difolt root ke alaava anya koi root TSA-NSSA main pravesh nahin karata
 TSA-NSSA ke routers ASBR dwaara prakshepit rooton ko chhod kar saare trephic ko ABR ko bhej dete hai
 a transit area has two or more OSPF border routers and is used to send traffic from one area to another contiguous area
 transit kshetra is trephic ko utpann nahin karata tathaa is prakaar ke trephic kaa gantavy nahin hota
 OSPF uses route cost as its basic routing metric, which is not the same as any standard value, such as speed, defined by the standard, so the network designer can take the metric to suit the design
 vyavhaarik rup main, yah die gaye root adress ke interphes kii gati dwaara maapi jaati he, yadhyapi ab network ke liye vishesh maapan karkon kii aavashyaktaa he kyonki 100 Mbit / s se tej link aam baat he
 Cisco uses 10 ^ 8 / bandwidth metric
 isliye ek 100mbit / s kii laagat 1 hogi, 10mbit / s kii laagat 10 hogi or isi prakaar gananaa kii jaayegi
 100mbit se bhi tej link ke liye laagat 1 se kam hogi
 However metrics can only be compared when they are of the same type
 There are four types of metrics, which are listed below in order of priority
 metric par dhyaan die bina ek intra-kshetra root ko ek inter-kshetra root ke mukaable hameshaa praathamikta di jaati he tathaa aisa hi anya prakaaron ke saath kiya jaataa he
 OSPF-TE is an extended form of OSPF that allows to speed up traffic engineering and allow it to be used on non-ip networks
 topology ke bare main adhik jaankaree opek LSA, jisamen tip-lambaai-mulya kii jaankaree hoti he, se mil sakati he
 These extensions allow OSPF-TE to run completely out of band of the data plane network
 iskaa arth yah he ki iskaa non-ip network jaise ki optical network main bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 OSPF-TE mainly describes a topology in GMPLS networks on which the GMPLS path can be established
 iske pashchaat puure network ke maanchitr kaa upyog karke GMPLS apana path seoup or forvarding protocol kaa prayog karata he
 The RFC 3717 documents operate in the optical route for IP, which is based on the "interrupt-based" extension of OSPF and IS-IS
 OSPF nimnlikhit prakaar ke router paribhaashit karata he: Router types are characteristics of an OSPF process
 ek router main ek yaa ek se adhik OSPF prakriyaayein ho sakati he
 For example, a router that is connected to more than one region and that receives routes from a BGP process connected to another AS is both an ABR and an ASBR
 prayek router main pahchaan karne kii kshamta he, jise saamanytah IP adress ke doted decimal formet main likhaa jaataa he 
 This ID must be employed for an OSPF process
 yadi spasht rup se niojit nahin he, to sabase bada logical IP adress router ID kii bhoomika grahan karegaa
 If there is no logical / loopback IP address, the largest IP address of an active physical interface will assume the role of router ID
 router idi ko network main sabanet kaa hissaa banane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he tathaa aksar bhram se bachane ke liye aisa kiya jaataa he
 Note: When reading router types, do not get confused with a designated router or backup designated router which are elements of a router and not the router itself
 ABR ek router he jo ek yaa adhik OSPF kshetron ko mukhya bakabon network se jodta he
 It is considered a member of all the regions to which it is connected
 ek ABR memory main link state databes kii kai pratiyaan rakhata he, har kshetra ke liye ek jisase vah router judaa hua he
 ASBR is a router that is connected to more than one AS and that sends routing information to routers in another AS
 asbrs aamtaur par non IGP rooting protocol, yaa static root athwa donon kaa prayog karata he
 
 ASBR is used by its AS to distribute routes received from other As
 IR ek router he jiske saare interphes ek hi kshetra main hote he
 Backbone Routers: These routers are a part of the OSPF backbone
 paribhaasha ke anusaar, inamen sabhi aria border routers bhi shaamil hai, kyonki ve kshetron ke bich kii rooting jaankaree dete hai
 However, a backbone router can also be a router that is only connected to another backbone router and is therefore not part of any region
 dhyaan den ki: ek aria border router hameshaa ek bakabon router he, lekin ek bakabon router kaa aria border router hona jaruri nahin he
 a designated router is a router interface that all routers choose over a particular multiaccess network segment and is generally considered to be a broadcast multiax
 vishesh takneekein, jo aksar vikreta par nirbhar he, DR prakriyaaon ko nonbrodcast multi acces media par sahaayak ho sakati hai
 It is generally wise to configure a single virtual circuit of the NBMA subnet into a single point-to-point line for which implementation-dependent techniques are used
 DR ko OSPF router ke prakaar na samajhen
 ek router ke kuch interphes decigneted ho sakate hai, kuch byaap decigneted or kuch non-decigneted ho sakate hai
 If there is no router DR or BDR on a subnet then DR is chosen first and next election is held if there is more than one BDR
 DR kaa chunaav nimnlikhit purvanirdhaarit mandandon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 The purpose of DR is to reduce network traffic by providing a source for routing updates
 DR network kii puri topology kii talika banaata he tathaa multicast ke dwaara duusare routers ko apadet bhejtaa he
 All routers in a region form a slave / owner relationship with DR
 ve keval sameepvarti DR or BDR ke saath hi aisa karte hai
 Whenever the router sends an update, it sends the DR and BDR to the multicast address 224
0
0
6
 iske pashchaat DR kshetra ke anya sabhi routers ko multicast adress 224
0
0
5 par apadet bhejtaa he
 This way all routers do not have to continuously update each other and can instead receive all their updates from a single source
 multicasting kaa upyog network lod ko or kam kar detaa he
 DR and BDR are always ready / selected on the broadcast network
 DR NBMA network par bhi chune ja sakate hai jaise ki frem riley yaa atm
 DR yaa BDR point tu point link par nahin chune jate kyonki link ke kisi ek chor par do routers puri tarah se paas paas hone chahiyein tathaa unke bich kii bandwidth or nahin sudhari ja sakati
 a backup designated router is a router that becomes a designated router when a problem occurs or fails in the current designated router
 BDR aakhri chunaav ke samay duusari sarvocch praathamikta vaala OSPF router he
 Connections to neighboring routers are dynamically created by sending multi-cast hello packets to 224

 ek DR or BDR saamaanya taur par chune jate hai or saamaanya rup se kaary karte hai
 As described in 2328 RFC, the following two official types for OSPF in NBMA topology are: cisco ne NBMA topology main OSPF ke liye teen or prakaar paribhaashit kiye hai: Mu Dynamics Service Analyst was credited with finding a 0-day problem in an open source OSPF
 duusare pareekshan upkaran bhi upyogita tathaa lod yaa tanaav kii jaanch ke liye bade paimaane par prayukt hote hai jaise iksia communication or agelent technologies ke upkaran
 OSPF is the first widely deployed protocol that can connect a network in a few seconds and guarantees a barrier-free route
 isamen kai visheshtaayen he jin se root ke prakshepan ke dauraan nitiyon ko lagu karne kii anumati milti he isliye iskaa prayog local, lod baantne ke liye tathaa IS-IS se zyada chuninda root emport karne ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 In contrast IS-IS can be employed for lower overheads in a static network, which is typically used in more isps than in business networks
 kuch aitihaasik durghatnaon kii vajah se IS-IS ISP ke liye praathmik IGP ban gaya he, lekin ab ISP, pehle ek sarvice proveader kii aavashkataaon ke anusaar ISIS ke laabh tathaa haani kii gananaa ke pashchaat, OSPF ko uski visheshtaon ke adhik prabhavi hone kii vajah se chun sakate he
 As mentioned, OSPF over external links can perform better load sharing than other igps
 jab ek aiespi ke difolt root ko OSPF main tip 1 bahya root ke rup main tathaa di gayi eksternal laagat main multiple asbrs dwaara pravaahit kiya jaataa he to duusare routers apane sthaan se asbrs ke paas kam se kam path laagat ke saath jaayenge
 bahya laagat ko samyojit karke ise or behatar kiya ja saktaa he
 Conversely, if default routes from different isps flow at a different external cost, Type II external form, then the low-cost default becomes the primary exit and the more expensive one becomes just the backup

 sabhi insaan kai alag-alag prakaar ke saamaajik samoohon se sambandhit hote hai, jisamen logon ke chote samooh se lekar badi saamaajik shreniyan tak hoti hai
 Intergroup Relations When people think and act as members of a group, they increase the similarities between themselves and members of their groups, and exaggerate differences between their group and members of other groups
 log is baat par nirbhar karte hai ki ve apane swayan ke samoohon yaa anya samoohon ke sadasyon ke sadsy hai yaa nahin; vishesh rup se, log aam taur par apane swayan ke samoohon ke sadasyon ke liye variyata dikhaate hai, jaise ki ve adhik sakaaratmak rup se unka moolyankan karte hai or unke vyavhaar ke liye adhik sakaaratmak shrey dete hai, jaisaa ki ve samooh samooh kaa moolyankan karte hai

 It has seen three great narratives and some of the most heroic works of valor still sung by local singers
 chittod ke durg ko 2013 main unesco vishwa viraasat sthal ghoshit kiya gaya
 According to historians, this fort was built by the Mauryan dynasty king Chitrangad Maurya in the seventh century and built it in the name of Chitrakuta
 mewar ke pracheen sikkon par ek taraf chitrakoot naam ankit miltaa he
 Later it came to be called Chittor
 san 738 raja bappa rawal ne raajaputaane par rajya karne vaale mauryvansh ke antim shaasha manmori ko haraakar yah kila apane adhikaar main kar liya
 Then the Paramara king Munj of Malwa snatched it from the Guhilvans and merged it with his kingdom
 is prakaar 9 veen -10 veen shatabdi main is par parmaron kaa aadhipaty rahaa
 In 1133, Solanki king Jai Singh of Gujarat defeated Yashovarman and took away Malwa from the Paramaras, due to which the fort of Chittorgarh also came under the authority of the Solankis

 It is a little difficult to say for sure about time
 ek kinvadanmat ke anusaar pandavon ke duusare bhai bhim ne ise kareeb 5000 varsh purv banwaaya tha
 The prevailing story in this regard is that once Bhima goes out in search of property, he meets a yogi Nirbhayanath and a Yeti Kukadeswar on the way
 bhim ne yogi se paras pathar maanga, jise yogi is shart par dene ko raji hua ki vah is pahari sthaan par raaton-raat ek durg kaa nirmaan karvaa de
 Bhima had almost finished this task with the help of his Shaurya and Devarup brothers, with only a little work remaining in the southern part
 yogi ke ruday main kapat ne sthaan le liya or usne yeti se murge kii aawaaj main bang dene ko kaha, jisase bhim savera samajhakar nirmaan kaary band kar de or use paras pathar nahin dena pade
 Bhima got angry on hearing the hen's bang and he gave a kick to the ground with anger, which made a big pit there, which people also know as the addiction pool
 vah sthaan jahaan bhim ke ghutane ne vishram kiya, bhim-ghodi kehalaata he
 The pond on which Yeti tied the rooster is called Kukdeshwar
 bappa rawal ke vanshaj jo sisodiya rajvansh ke sansthaapak rana hammir ne punah maldev se yah kila hastgat kiya
 Hamir was very powerful and visionary
 usne yahan 50 varshon tak badi yogyata se shashan karte hue apane rajya kaa vistaar kiya
 With his efforts, the glory of Chittor was restored
 or road rajya dwaara stapit kiya san 1538 main chittod par gujarat ke bahadurshah ne akraman kar diya
 This war is known as the Second Shaka of Mewar
 san 1567 main mewar kaa teesraa shaakaa hua, jisamen akbar ne chittod par chadhaai kar di thi
 All this Muslim invasion is one of the main reasons for the cultural destruction of Chittorgarh
 tisare shaake ke baad hi san 1559 main maharana udaisingh ne mewar kii rajdhani chittod se hataakar aravali ke madhya pichhola jhil ke paas sthapit kar di, jo aaj udaipur ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The fort of Chittorgarh always has a special significance in Rajputana
 ise mewar ke guhilavanshiyon kii pehali rajdhani ke rup main sammaan praapt he, jise unhone mauryvansh ke antim shaasha manmoni ko haraakar apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 This fort is built in length from north to south on the hill of Aravali, in which a tank, pond, temple, palace etc
 have all been built from time to time under a definite construction plan due to the level land in the middle
 kuch jalashay to aise hai jo nirantar jalaapurti ke saadhan ke rup main kaam aate rahe hai
 There is a saying prevalent in relation to this fort, which explains the importance of this fort
 vastav main is durg kaa nirmaan abhi bhi hamen vismay va romaanch se bhar detaa he
 But from a strategic point of view it shows that due to its geographical reasons it was not suitable for fortification like fortifications like Ranthambore and Kubhalgarh
 ni:andeh kila sudrudh tha
 On the edge of the hill was a row of rocks standing on top of which a high and strong type was built
 saath hi saath durg main pravesh karne ke liye lagaataar saat daravaaje kuch interval par banaae gayi the
 For all these reasons, it was very difficult for the enemies to enter the fort
 parantu yah vistrut maidan ke bich ek lambi pahari par bana he jo anya parvat shreniyon se pruthak ho gaya he
 Therefore, it was easily prevented by the enemies by encircling it and transporting the logistics used in the fort
