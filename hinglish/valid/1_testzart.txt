 Cried out manshali File transfer protocol is a network protocol through which files are exchanged over an Internet-based TCP / IP network
 ise upayokta aadhaarit kuta yaa anonimas yujar acces ke dwaara kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Now with FTP servers in almost every institution, this system does not work
 anek haal ke web broujar or file prabandhak apatpi sarvaron se jud sakate hai
 This can do the same thing as local files on files coming from remote locations
 isamen apatpi yuarel prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Other methods of sending files such as SFTP and SCP are not associated with FTP
 inaki puri prakriya main esaech kaa prayog hota he
 The File Transfer Protocol or FTP in its current form has arrived at various stages
 sarvapratham 16 april, 1971 main ise refsi 114 ke naam se taiyaar kiya gaya tha jise baad main june, 1980 main refsi 765 se badla gaya jise san aktubar 1985 main refsi 959 se parivartit kiya gaya
 After that, many security related changes came
 ye suraksha sambandhi badlaav isliye laae gaye the kyonki aarambh main sanchikaayen bhejne kaa yah tarika bahut asurakshit tha
 The main reason for this vulnerability was that anyone could steal or copy that file on the same network in the process of sending the file
 achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet se purv yah internet protocol ke kaaryakshetra main aane vaali ek aam samasya bani hui thi
 This problem was possible only through SFTP
 apatpi ko sakriy mod, niskriy mod or vistrut niskriy mod main sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 In September 1998 by RFC 2428, extended passive mode was added
 network par data antarit karte samay, kai data pratinidhitiv kiye ja sakate hai
 There are two most common transfer modes: FTP sarwar vaapasi code, apane bheetar ke ankon dwaara apni sthiti suchit karte hai
 The basic FTP specification is an inherently unsafe method of transferring files, as there is no specified method of transferring data in an encrypted manner
 iskaa arth yah he ki adhikansh network vinyason ke antargat, prayokta naam, password, afatipi cmand or antarit sanchikaayen, ek packet sansuchak ke upyog dwaara usee network par avasthit koi bhi antarit sanchikaon ko hathiyaa saktaa he
 This has been a common problem for many Internet protocol specifications written prior to the creation of SSL such as HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet
 is samasya ke liye aam samaadhaan he esaftipi, yaa apatpies, jo arefasi 4217 main vinirdisht tareeqe se afatipi main esasail yaa tles ancripshan jodate hai
 a host providing FTP service is additionally capable of providing anonymous FTP access
 prayokta naam ke liye puche jane par, prayokta saamaanya taur par 'anaam' khate kii seva main log-in karte hai
 Although users are generally asked to send their e-mail address in lieu of a password, little or no verification of the supplied information is done
 chunki aadhunik afatipi client aam taur par prayokta se anaam pravesh prakriya ko chhupate hai, afatipi client, password ke rup main nakli data kii aapurti kar sakate hai kyonki anuprayog ko prayokta kaa i-mail pataa gyaat nahin ho saktaa he
 The Gopher protocol, as well as the simple file transfer protocol and file service protocol, have been suggested as an alternative to anonymous FTP
 jahaan apatpi acces prayog main nahin aata, vahaan doorvarti yaa remote apatpi yaa apatpi mail prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this, an email is sent to another FTP server that completes the FTP command and sends back an attachment containing the download file
 yah khaskar vahaan prayog main laayaa jaataa he, jahaan FTP pahunch pratibandhit ho
 An e-mail containing the FTP command to be executed is sent to the remote FTP server
 yah ek mail sarwar hota he jo aavak i-mail ko pars karata he, afatipi commandon ko karyanvit karata he or atachament ke rup main downlod kiye gaye kisi sanchika ke saath i-mail waapas bhejtaa he
 This is obviously less flexible than an FTP client, as directories cannot be seen interacting or modifying commands, and replies may also have problems with large file attachments escaping through the mail server
 aajkal adhikansh internet prayoktaaon ke paas afatipi kaa pahunch sulabh he, atah yah prakriya dainandin upyog main prachlit nahin he
 Currently modern and recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers, although they may lack support for protocol extensions such as FTPS
 yah afatipi par doorvarti sanchikaon kii adla-badali main sthaneey sanchikaon ke liye prayukt interfes jaise madhyam ko anumat karata he
 This is done by an FTP URL
 yah is rup main hota he: Alternatively a password can be provided in the URL, eg: adhikansh web brouzaron ko niskriy mod afatipi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jisase puraa karne hetu sabhi afatipi sarwar sakasham nahin hai
 Some browsers only allow files to be downloaded, but do not provide any means to upload files to the server
 ypi pate or port cmand par port sankhyaon kaa pratinidhitiv or pieesavi uttar, network pataa anuwaad upkarnon ke liye FTP se nipatane main ek or chunauti he
 These values have to be changed by the NAT tool, so that they include the IP address of the nat-ed client and the port selected by the NAT device for the data connection
 nayaa pataa or port sambhawatah unke dashamalav pratinidhitiv kii lambaai main apane mul pate or port se alag hon
 This means that the value on the control connection must be carefully changed, with the NAT tool changing the TCP sequence and acknowledgment fields for all subsequent packets
 adhikansh NAT upkarnon main aam taur par is tarah ke anuwaad nahin kiye jate hai, balki is uddeshy ke liye vishesh anuprayog stareey get-ve uplabdh rahete hai
 FTP over SSH refers to the use of creating a normal FTP session container over an SSH connection
 afatipi ek se adhik tisipi conekshnon kaa upyog karata he, atev esaech par tunnel bananaa vishesh rup se kathin hota he
 As with many SSH clients, attempting to prepare the tunnel for the control channel would only protect the channel; When data is transferred, FTP software on both ends will establish TCP connections, which will pass over the SSH connection to the bypass, thus securing privacy, integrity protection, etc
 anyathaa, esaech client software ke liye afatipi protocol kaa vishisht gyaan or afatipi niyantran sandeshon kii nigaraanee or punarlekhan tathaa swytt rup se afatipi data channelon ke liye nae agreshan kholana aavashyak hota zaruri he
 Version 3 of SSH Communications Security's software parikar and FONC licensed by GPL are two software packages that support this mode
 SSH kii apeksha FTP ko kabhi-kabhi surakshit FTP ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he; ise FTP surakshit karne kii SSL / TLS jaisi anya paddati nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Other methods of transferring files using SSH include SFTP and SCP, which are not related to FTP; In each of these, the entire conversation is always protected by the SSH protocol

 Brajbhasha was the main literary language of Madhya Pradesh in India from the 13th century to the 20th century as well as the literary language of all India
 vibhinn sthaneey bhashaai samanvay ke saath samast bharat main vistrut rup se prayukt hone vaali hindi kaa purv rup yah ‘brajabhasha‘ apane vishuddh rup main aaj bhi agra, dhaulpur, mathura or aligarh jilon main boli jaati he jise ham 'kendriya brajabhasha' ke naam se bhi pukaar sakate hai
 Hindi-poetry was composed initially in Brajbhasha itself
 sabhi bhakt kaviyon, reetikalin kaviyon ne apni rachanaaen isi bhashaa main likhi hai jinamein pramukh hai surdaas, rahim, raskhaan, keshav, ghananand, bihari, ityadi
 In terms of language and style, there was a wide area of shaurseni or Western apostrophes
 brajabhasha ko ek prakaar se isi vyapak kshetra kii seemayen viraasat main mili thim
 The style-form of Brajbhasha touches boundaries far beyond the language-field
 kuch lekhakon ne brajabhasha naam se uske kshetra-vistaar kaa kathan kiya he
 Surajmal, the author of 'vansh Bhaskar', is considered to be between Braj Bhasha Pradesh Delhi and Gwalior
 'tuhaftul hind' ke rachayita mirza khan ne brajabhasha ke kshetra kaa ullekh is prakaar kiya he "bhashaa' braj tathaa uske paas-pados main boli jaati he
 Gwalior and Chandwar are also included in it
 ganga-yamuna kaa doaab bhi brajabhasha kaa kshetra he
 According to Lallujilal, the area of brajbhasha is "brajbhasha", which is the language spoken in Braj, District Gwalior, Bharatpur, Bateshwar, Bhadavar, Antveda and Bundelkhand
 isamen shabd mathura kshetra kaa vaachak he
 'lallujilal has also written that the Braj language of Braj and Gwalior is pure and refined
 grearsan ne brajabhasha-seemayen is prakaar likhi hai
 "mathura is the center
 dakshin main agre tak, bharatpur, dhaulpur or karauli tak brajabhasha boli jaati he
 The same is prevalent in the western parts of Gwalior and the eastern part of Jaipur
 uttar main isaki seemaa gudgaanv ke purvi bhaag tak pahunchati he
 In the northeast, its boundaries are up to Doab
 bulandshahr, aligarh, eta tathaa gangapar ke badaanu, bareli tathaa nainital ke tarai pargane bhi isi kshetra main he
 The language of the intermediate Doab is given the name Intuvedi
 antarvedi kshetra main agra, eta, mainpuri, farrukhabad tathaa itawa jile aate hai, kintu itawa or farrukhabad kii bhashaa inke anusaar kannauji hai, shesh samast bhaag brajbhaashi he
 ' kelaag ne likhaa he ki raajapootaana kii boliyon ke uttar-purv, puure apper doaab tathaa ganga-yamuna kii ghaatiyon main brajabhasha boli jaati he
 Dr
 Dhirendra Verma has not considered the Kannauji area specified by Grierson as distinct from the area of briji
 apane surveykshan ke aadhaar par unhone kanpur tak, brajbhaashi kshetra hi kaha he
 According to him, the districts of Mathura, Aligarh, Agra, Bulandshahar, Etah, Mainpuri, Badaun and Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh - eastern part of Punjab and Gurgaon district - Bharatpur, Dhaulpur, Karauli in Rajasthan and eastern part of Jaipur - Gwalior in central India
 The western part of the region falls in the Briji region
 chunki grearsan sahab kaa yah mat lekhak ko maanya nahin ki kannauji swatantra boli he, isliye uttar pradesh ke pilibhit, shahjahanpur, farrukhabad, hardoi, itawa or kanpur ke jile bhi brajabhasha kshetra main sammilit kar liye hai
 The area of brajbhasha spoken thus becomes extremely wide
 ek prakaar se pracheen madhyadesh kaa adhikansh bhaag isamen sammilit ho jaataa he
 Braj Bhasha became distinguished as poetry
 kai shatabdiyon tak isamen kavy- rachana hoti rahi
 Violation of the boundaries of the general Braj Bhasha-region created a greater area of braj Bhasha-style
 is baat kaa anumaan reetikaal ke kavi acharya bhikharidasji ne kiya
 He clearly stated that the introduction of Brajbhasha can also be found from poets living outside Braj
 yah nahin samajhnaa chahie ki brajabhasha madhur- sundar he
 Not only Sanskrit and Farsi, other languages also have a mix with it
 phir bhi brajabhasha style kaa vaishishty prakat rahata he
 This also proves that Braj Bhasha style was integrated with many languages
 vastav main 16veen shatee ke madhya tak brajabhasha kii mishrit style saare madhyadesh kii kavy-bhashaa ban gai thi
 Bhakti movement was also involved in expansion
 krishna-bhakthi kii rachanaaon main ek prakaar se yah style rudh ho gai thi
 Pt
 Vishwanath Prasad Mishra has revealed the geographical location of Braj Bhakta-poets of many states in this way - "braj's descendant - Meera dancing with unique sound of his footsteps with sound was from Rajasthan, Namdev was from Maharashtra, Narsi was from Gujarat, Bharatendu Harishchandra was from Bhojpuri language area
 


bihar main bhojpuri, magahi or maithili bhashaa kshetron main bhi brajabhasha ke kai pratibhashali kavi hue hai
 Earlier poets of Bengal also wrote poetry in Brajbhasha
 ' In the west, Rajasthan continued to use Brajbhasha styles in abundance, and in the west, Brajbhasha style was also extended to Gujarat and Kutch
 kuccha ke maharav lakhapat bade vidyapremi the
 He also opened a school for the promotion and training of Brajbhasha
 is prakaar madhyakaal main brajabhasha kaa prasar braj evam uske aasapaas ke pradeshon main hi nahin, purvavarti pradeshon main bhi rahaa
 In Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kathiawad and Kutch etc
 Brajbhasha compositions were also done
 brajabhasha style ke kshetra vistaar kii do sthitiyaan raheen
 The first situation arose from the sequence of language scientific history
 jab pashchimi yaa madhyadeshiy bhashaa anek kaarnon se apni bhugolic simaaon kaa ulanghan karne lagi, tab sthaneey rupon se samanvit hokar, vah ek visisth bhashaa style kaa rup grahan karne lagi
 Areas in which this text, rather than the language of language, have been molded into artificial, mixed and specific forms used only in literature, and have become embedded in specific occasions, contexts or poetic forms, will be considered as genre areas
 style-kshetra purvayugin bhashaa-vistaar yaa style-vistaar ke sahare badhata he
 The later forms of Western or Madhyapriya Apabhramsa expanded in this way
 duusari sthiti tab upasthit hui jab purv-parampara kii bhashaa-style kii kshetreey vistruti to prishthbhumi bani or shailigat kshetra-vistaar ke aitihaasik or vastugat kaaran bhi upasthit ho gaye

 Originally from them, it appears that in about 176 BC, Mao Tanu, the ruler of Heung Nu, sent a message to the Chinese emperor that he had ousted Yuvachi and drove him into the area between Tunu Huang and Ki Lien

 Later the Yuvachi caste had to leave the area themselves due to Vasun's invasion

 In 126 BC, Chinese Ambassador Chang Kien found the race of Yuvachi on the river Akshu
 euvachi kii mukhya shakha ne aage chalakar pun: shako ko haraaya or kapish par adhikaar kar liya
 From this time, the historical relationship of Yuvachi caste begins with India

 In opposition to this, some scholars find no connection between the Yuichi and Kushan dynasty
 unka kathan he ki kushaan vastav main shaq jati ke hi ek ang the or yuichi ne jab shakon ko haraaya to isi vansh ke kuch pramukh sardaar yuichi main mil gaye
 Later Chinese historians did not understand the separation of these two nations
 kushaanon ke atirikt chaar or jatiyon ne yuichi aadhipaty sweekaar kar liya tha
 In fact, Yuichi's struggle with those castes named Heungnu and Nusun and the bloodshed of each other does not seem appropriate with Kujul Cadficz assuming his 'satyadharma Pramukh' title

 One version of the legend states that Houyi was an immortal and Chang'e was a beautiful young girl, the queen mother of Yudi West, the palace of the Jade Emperor
 Houyi the other immortals, who then aroused him jealousy before the Jade Emperor
 Houyi and his wife, Chang'e, were later banished from heaven

 The second version of the legend, similar to the one above, is saying that Chang'e swallowed the pill of immortality because Peng, a Houyi of several trainee archers, is different in trying to force him to shoot her
 
 jaanate hue bhi ki vah band peng nahin lard saktaa he, Chang'e koi chaara nahin balki khud goli nigal tha saanchaa:prashasti patr kii jarurat Other versions say that Houyi and Chang'e still live in heaven at the time that Houyi nine immortals of the Sun
 Houyi and Chang'e were the sons of punishment by the sun birds Jade Emperor, who forced them to live on Earth as humans
 dekh rahaa he ki Chang'e atyant amarta kii use nuksaan par dukhi mahasoos kiya, Houyi ko goli he ki ise behaal hoga khojane kaa faisla kiya
 At the end of his hunt, he meets the Queen Mother of the West, who agreed to give him the shot, but warns him that each person will only need one half of the shot to achieve immortality
 Houyi brought the pill home and stored it in a case
 He warned Chang'e not to open the case and then left home for a while
 Like Pandora in Greek mythology, Chang'e became inquisitive
 He opened the case and found the bullet, just as Houyi was returning home
 nervas ki Houyi use pakadaney ke liye, cese kii saamagree kii khoj karenge, vah galati se puure goli nigal karne ke liye or adhik maatra kii vajah se aasmaan main naav shuru kar diya
 Some versions of the legend do not refer to Houyi or Chang'e as being previously immortal and initially require them instead of humans as current mortals
 vahaan bhi kahani ke sanskaran jisamen Houyi nau surya kii maut ho gai or logon ko bachaane ke liye ek inaam ke rup main raja banaaya gaya tha
 However, King Houyi became a dictator who either stole the pill of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West or learned that he could make such a pill every night for a hundred nights by grinding the body of a different teenage boy
 Chang'e stole the pill and swallowed it herself, either to stop more boys being killed or her husband's tyrannical mold from lasting forever: the citation needed to stop the rule

 Astronomy The study of the light, origin, structure and behavior of celestial bodies located in the universe is a matter of astronomy
 ab tak brahmad ke jitne bhaag kaa pataa chalaa he usamen lagbhag 19 arab akaash gangaaon ke hone kaa anumaan he or prayek akaash ganga main lagbhag 10 arab taare hai
 The diameter of Akash Ganga is about one lakh light years
 hamaari prithvi par aadim jeev 2 arab saal pehle paidaa hua or aadmi kaa dharti par avatan 10-20 lakh saal pehle hua
 According to scientists, the universe originated from the explosion of a superpower
 surya ek ausat tara he jiske nau mukhya grah hai, unamem se prithvi bhi ek he
 Every star in this universe is like the Sun
 bahut-se taare to aise hai jinke saamne apana surya anu ke baraabar bhi nahin thahartaa he
 Just as there are planets of the Sun and we all call them together in the name of Solar family, similarly each star has its own family

 In view, the stars of the Ganges seem to be interconnected, but this vision is illusion
 ek duusare se sate hue taron ke bich kii duuri arabon mile ho sakati he
 When this is the condition of contiguous stars, then the distance between the wires located far away is such a calculation that it is difficult to say
 isi kaaran se taaraon ke bich tathaa anya lambii dooriyaan prakashavarsh main maapi jaati hai
 a light year is the distance that the distance light travels in a year at a speed of one lakh twenty six thousand thousand miles per second
 udhaaharan ke liye surya or prithvi ke bich kii duuri sava nau karod mile he, prakaash yah duuri sava aath minute main tay karata he
 Thus, the distance of the Sun from Earth was a quarter to eight light minutes
 jin taron se prakaash aath hajaar varshon main aata he, unki duuri hamane paune santalis padam mile aanki he
 But the stars are so far away that it takes millions, crores, billions of years for light to come from them
 is sthiti main hamen in duriyon ko milon main vyakt karnaa sambhav nahin hoga or na kuch samaj main hi aayega
 That's why scientists have used the unit of light year
 maan lijie, brahmad ke kisi or nakshatron aadi ke baad bahut dur dur tak kuch nahin he, lekin yah baat antim nahin ho sakati he

 If you get the screen of this light, then the tilt of the screen is more towards red color

 Many people will be familiar with the sound related Doppler effect
 jab ham prakaash ke sandarbh main dopalar prabhaav ko dekhte hai to dur se aanevaale prakaash kaa jhukaav nile rang kii ore hota he or dur jane vaale prakaash strot ke prakaash kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore hota he
 Thus Hubble's observations revealed that the sky Ganges is going away from us
 habal ne yah bhi bataaya ki unki prithvi se dur hatane kii gati, prithvi se unki duuri ke anupaat main he
 Astronomers have observed the extinction of the galaxy from the telescope of a 200-inch diameter lens located at Mount Polomer Observatory
 doorabeen se brahmad ko dekhne par hamen aisa prathit hota he ki ham is brahmad ke centrebindu hai or baaki chijen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 If observers are sent to other sky Ganges, they will also find that they are the focal point of this universe, the rest of the sky Ganges are running away from us
 ab jo sahi chitra hamaare saamne aata he, vah yah he ki brahmad kaa samaan gati se vistaar ho rahaa he
 And any point of this huge format is moving away from other objects
 habal ke anusandhan ke baad brahmad ke siddhanton kaa pratipaadan aavashyak ho gaya tha

 lekin phir bhi ainstin ke siddhant ko soramandal sambandhi nirikshanon par aadhaarit nishkarshon kii vyakhya karne main newton ke siddhanton se adhik safalataa praapt hui thi
 According to Newton, the transpiration force between the two bodies has an immediate effect on each other, but Einstein proved that the speed of reciprocal transpiration power cannot be as fast as the speed of light
 aakhir yahan par ainstin ne newton ke patr ko galat pramanit kiya
 People liked Einstein's theory

 According to this belief, the universe has originated from the explosion of a Mahapind and that is why the Ganges of the sky is running away from us
 is brahmad kaa ulataa chitra aap apane saamne rakhie tab aapako brahmad prasaarit na dikhaai dekar sakunchit hota hua dikhaai degaa or akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui na dikhaai dekar aati hui prathit hogi
 Therefore, it means to say that at some time there must have been a Mahapind and due to its explosion, the Akash Ganges are running away from us

 Historians understand that it has all the signs that are in the respective settlements of the Indus Valley
 mana jaataa he ki lajvard ke alaava yahan se tin or sona bhi hokar jaataa tha or sambhav he ki madhya asia kaa or bhi maal dakshin main bhartiya upmahadweep bheja jaataa ho
 This settlement was spread over two mountains, which were referred to by archaeologists as' a 'and B'
 'e' par rahane kii basti thi or 'bi' par ek qilenuma nirmaan ke khandhhar hai
 Both are spread over an area of two hectares
 yahan kuch sankshipt likhaai vaali ek mohar, mitti ke bane bail or baiylgaadee kii pratimaaen or rang kare hue mitti ke bartan mili hai
 These are all things related to the Indus Valley Civilization
 do yaa adhik dhatvik tatwon ke aanshik yaa purna thos-vilyan ko mishratu yaa mishra dhaatu kehete hai
 Steel is an alloy
 praayah mishra dhaatuon ke gun us mishradhatu ko banane vaale sanghatakon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai
 Steel is stronger than iron
 kaansa, pital, taanka aadi mishratu hai
 Alloy is a term that is widely used for any metallic substance, unless it is a chemical element
 mishradhatu banane kii kala ati pracheen he
 The truth is that the importance of bronze was so much in one era that the name of that era of development of human civilization has become 'bronze Age'
 yadhyapi shuddh dhaatuon ke kai upyogi gun hai, jaise ooshmaa or vidyut kii suchaalakata, tathaapi yantric or nirmaan sambandhi kaaryon main saadharantaya shuddh dhaatuen upyog main nahin laai jaatin, kyonki inamen aavashyak majbootee nahin hoti
 The most important method of making a metal stronger is metalworking
 is disha main 19veen shatabdi main bahut adhik prayaas hua, usee kaa fal he ki anek upyogi kaaryon ke liye aaj paanch hajaar se bhi adhik mishradhatuen uplabdh hai or nai mishradhatuen taiyaar karne ke liye nity nae nae prayog kiye ja rahe hai
 Today alloys with desired properties are made for any particular use
 dhaatuen jab kisi saamaanya vilyan, jaise amla, main ghulti he tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ko chhod detii hai or saadharantaya lavan banaati hai, kintu pighalaane par jab ve paraspar ghulti hai tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ke sahit rahati hai
 Such solid solutions of metals are called alloys
 anek mishradhaatuon main adhatuen bhi alp maatra main hoti hai, kintu sampurna kaa gun dhatvik rahata he
 Therefore, in 1939, the American Board of Examiners made the following definition of alloy - prarambh main mishradhatu kaa adhiktam upyog sikkon or aabhushanon ke banane main hota tha
 Copper, tin and zinc are 95 / 4 and 1 percent respectively in copper coins
 san 1920 tak england main chaandi ke sikke, 'sterling' chaandi ke banaae jate the, jisamen chaandi or tanba kramash: 92
5 or 7
5 pratishat hote the
 In the United States, silver and copper are 90 and 10 percent of all silver coins, respectively
 england ke sone ke sikken main sona or tanba kramash: 91
67 or 8
33 pratishat hote hai or america ke sone ke sikkon main sona 90 pratishat tathaa shesh anya dhaatuen, visheshkar tanba rahata he
 Platinum, gold and silver are used to add beauty to the colors of jewelery, to make them hard, strong and durable, or to mix them with other metals for sale at cheaper prices
 yah nishchay karnaa ki mishradhatuen saadhaaran mishran hai yaa rasinic yogic, ek jatil samasya he
 In some sense, these are chemical compounds, because when sodium succulents are made, then every piece of sodium in the cross causes a strong flame of light and the mercury becomes hot, a symptom of the compound being formed
 isi prakaar pighalate hue sone main jab aluminium dhaatu kaa ek tukdaa daalate hai, tab itani adhik ooshmaa utpann hoti he ki sampurna pighali hui dhaatu ujjwal prakashmay ho jaati he
 The color of many alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 udaahranarth, chaandi or jasta dona shwet rang ke hote hai, kintu inase jo mishradhatu banati he uskaa rang ati sundar gulabi hota he
 Gold is yellow and aluminum is white, but the color of their alloy is very shiny
 yah gun bhi yogicon kaa he
 On extracting the melting point of alloys, it is known that the behavior of alloys is of two types: The melting point of some alloys changes as the content of the metal changes, it is the property of the mixture and the melting point of some alloys is a constant temperature
 Occurs, indicating that alloys are compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke bhautik tathaa rasinic gun apni avyav dhaatuon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai or mishradhaatuon ke gun kisi bhi prakaar se avyav dhaatuon ke gunon ke madhya nahin hote
 This difference is due to the fact that when metals are melted together, they form many interconnected compounds and solid solutions
 mishradhatu kaa ghanatv apni avyav-dhaatuon ke madhya ghanatv se kam yaa adhik ho saktaa he
 The color of some alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 ye apni avyav dhaatuon se kathortar, kintu kam lacheelee tathaa ghaatvarghy or adhik bhangur hoti hai
 The melting point of alloys is always less than the melting point of the melting element at maximum temperature
 or praaia: nunatam taap par pighalanevaali avyav dhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 For example, an alloy containing lead, tin, bismuth and cadmium is faulted at 75 ° C, while the melting point of tin, the metallic ingredient at the lowest temperature, is 232 ̊c
 ye sab ve gun hai jinke kaaran mishradhatuen shuddh dhaatuon se adhik moolyawaan ho jaati hai tathaa udyog main adhik upyogi siddh hoti hai
 As a result of detailed study of the organization and crystalline composition of alloys by the fruits mentioned above and by microscopes, X-ray spectral measurements, thermal and chemical analysis and other physical tests, alloys are placed in three categories
 yah vibhaajan mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuon ke parmaanuon kaa samooh kis prakaar se sangathit he, uske aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 These three categories are the following: is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuen jab pighali hui hoti hai, tab ve ek duusare main ghuli hui rahati hai, kintu thos hone par dhaatuon ke crystal alag-alag ho jate hai, arthath dhaatuen paraspar aviley hai
 In this way, the alloy is a mixture of pure crystals of each element metal, and on cooling, one element separates the metal into solid form
 udaahranarth, ek taral mishradhatu, jisamen matraanusaar 10 bhaag sisa or 90 bhaag tin hote hai, jab thandi kii jaati he tab shuddh tin ke crystal pratham usee prakaar se pruthak hote hai jis prakaar shuddh him ke crystal chini ke tanu vilyan main se thanda karne par pruthak hote hai
 The temperature at which tin crystals begin to separate is lower than the melting point of pure tin
 tin ke galnaank ko jab usamen sisa ghulaa rahata he, gyaat kar sise kaa anubhaar usee niyam dwaara nikaalte hai jis niyam se pani main ghuli vaston kaa anubhaar nikaalte hai
 By this method, several molecules of those metals have been extracted, which remain as separate atoms in the diluent solution
 sisa-antimony mishradhatu mishran shrenee kii he
 Antimony is brittle and lead soft
 mudran dhaatu sisi, antimony or atyant kam maatra main tin kii mishradhatu he
 This alloy has the hardness of antimony, but it is not as brittle as that
 is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main ek avyav dhaatu ke parmaanu duusari avyav dhaatu ke crystalia dhaanche main bhalee-bhanti baith jate hai
 There are two different types of alloys of solid solution: tanba-nikal kii anek mishradhatuen jinka mahatvapurn upyog he, thos vilyan kii shrenee main aati hai
 For example, alloys from which nickel coins, rifle bullets and a wire have high electrical resistance are made
 canada ke bahut se khanijon main tanba or nikal ke sulphide hote hai, jinako galane se ek mishradhatu milti he
 It contains nickel and copper 67 and 28 percent and the remaining five percent contains iron and manganese respectively
 is mishradhatu ko monelle dhaatu kehete hai
 It is more tensile, flexible and corrosion resistant
 saadhaarant: dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar yogic nahin banaatin, kintu ooshmaa vishleshan dwaara gyaat hua he ki dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar bahut adhik sankhya main yogic banaati hai
 The class name of these compounds is interstitial compound
 is prakaar ke sabase adhik yogic kshar or kshareey mitti kii dhaatuen, aavart sarini ke visham upavirgo kii dhaatuon ke saath sanyog karke, banaati hai
 The amount of metals in these compounds is reflected by chemical formulas
 in sutron ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki is prakaar ke yogic sanyojaktaa ke un sab niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hai jo dhaatu tathaa adhatu ke sanyog se bananevaale yogicon dwaara pratipaadit hue hai
 For example, sodium, tin and lead are chemically reacted to form the following compounds: anek antaradhaatuk yogic bahut sthaayee hote hai or apane galnaank se adhik taap par garam karne se bhi apni avyav dhaatuon main vighatit nahin hote
 These compounds dissolve in liquid ammonia and thus the solution prepared is an electronegative
 jab inkaa vaidyut apghaton kiya jaataa he, tab ek avyav dhaatu, jo duusari kii apeksha nune dhanvidyuti hoti he, dhanagar par jamati he or duusari runagra par
 There is no theoretical explanation as to why interstitial compounds are formed
 keval itnaa hi pratipaadit ho paaya he ki ve dhaatuen, jinke gun ek se hai, ek duusare ke saath sanyog nahin karti hai
 Since these types of alloys are hard, brittle, very less tensile and flexible, only a few of these are useful
 sab mishradhaatuon ko saadharantaya louh tathaa aloh mishradhaatuon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 When iron is the base metal in the alloy, then that iron and when the base metal is any other metal, then it is called non-ferrous alloy

 In 1895 X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Konrad Runtzen, a professor of physics at the University of Wurtzburg in Germany
 yadi kaanch kii nalika main se vaayu ko pump se kramash: nikaala jaae or usamen ucch vibhav kaa vidyudvisarjan kiya jaae, to daab ke paryaapt alp hone par vaayu swayan prakashit hone lagati he
 While conducting an experimental study of this phenomenon, Rantzen observed that when the air pressure was very low, the rays coming out of the sluice tube gave light to barium platinocyanide and, when the tube was completely covered with black paper Also, the manibh kept nearby keeps on shouting
 at: yah spasht tha ki visarjananalika ke baahar jo kirane aati hai ve kaale kaagaj main se sugamawa se paar ho sakati hai or barium platinosynide ke parade ko dhyutimaan karne kaa vishesh gun in kirnon main he
 Such rays were not yet known in science
 at: in nai avishkrut kirnon kaa naam 'eksrez' rakhaa gaya, kintu rantjan ke sammaan main, visheshat : germany main, in kirnon ko 'rantjan kirane' hi kaha jaataa he
 As soon as Rantzen's invention was published, the attention of the entire scientific world was attracted to X-ray

 daab ke atyant alp ho jane par electranon se sanghaat hone ke liye paryaapt anu nahin rahete; at: electron runagra se nikalakar apni sampurna urja se dhanagar se sidhe takaraate hai
 Due to these effects, the intense energy of electrons gets to the atoms of the cation and one result is the production of X-rays
 is paddati se eksre kaa utpaadan karne ke liye nalika main ek kranthik daab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If the air pressure is higher than this critical pressure, then there is not enough energy in the electrons to produce the x-ray 
 duusari ore, yadi daab is kranthik daab se kam ho to electron utpann hi nahin hote, at: vidyudvisarjan hi band ho jaataa he
 Initially the X-ray was produced using a similar type of aerial and the air pressure was kept at a critical value of this critical pressure
 eksre ke do vishesh gundharm adhik mahatvapurn hai : There are three main methods of intensity measurement
 pratideept parade par eksre se jo dipti aati he uski tivrata-maryaadit dipti tak-eksre kii tivrata kii samaanupati hoti he
 The intensity of the x-ray can be broadly compared by estimating the intensity of fluorescence
 duusari vidhi main photo pattica ke upar eksre kii jo kriya hoti he, uskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The blackness that comes from the X-ray incident on the photo plate depends on the intensity of the X-ray and the time of incidence
 is paddati se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii tulana karne ke liye adhik tivrata ke eksre punj se photo pattica par maryaadit sthaan par kisi upyukt kaal tak kriya hone di jaati he or tatpashchaat usee pattica par kuch neeche duusare eksre punj kii kriya kaal t, 2t, 3t aadi tak hone di jaati he
 After developing the plaque, comparing the blackness of the two pictures gives a sense of the relative intensity of the two arms
 tivrathamapan kii teesri reeti adhik prachlit he, kyonki is reeti se tivrata thik thik maapi ja sakati he
 When the x-ray passes through the air, the air becomes electronegative and its conductivity depends on the intensity of the x-ray
 eksre kii kriya se vaayu ke anuon ke electron visthapit hote hai or aayan utpann hote hai
 In the presence of proper electrodepolarization, the electrons that can be obtained from ions can be measured with a sensory electronometer, or with other appropriate sensory devices
 eksre kii tivrata vidyuddhara kii samaanupati hoti he
 More recently, the use of multiplier-illuminant and x-ray sensing spurs has made intensity measurements extremely accessible
 usee prakaar, gaigagunak kii sahaayta se ynikaran kii dhara kaa maapan bhi sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 Therefore, measurement of intensity of X-rays by both these types of devices is more prevalent in present day
 tivrathamapan kii in teenon prachlit ritiyon se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii keval tulana hi ho sakati he, nirpeksh tivrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 In fact, we can call the intensity of the X-ray as the energy exerted per second on an area of one square centimeter perpendicular to the x-ray
 is tivrata ko arg prati varg centimetre prati senkad main vyakt karte hai
 In order to measure intensity as energy, the energy of the X-ray is very low because in this way intensely specific instruments are required for intensification
 is reeti se tivrathamapan kaa pratham prayaas terril ne kiya tha
 Subsequently, in 1953, Henderson, BT and Laffan of the University of Illinois in the United States also tried
 ati prachand vidyudvibhav se utpann eksre kii tivrata keval isi reeti se naapi ja sakati he
 Experimental work of physics always requires units and has its shape according to the measured amount
 eksre kii maatra ke ekak ko 'rantjan' kehete hai or vartmaan kaal main ek rantjan kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit prakaar se kii jaati he- Another special feature of X-rays is their solubility
 bhinn bhinn thos pindon kii samaan motaayiyon main se paar hone par eksre kii tivrata main jo kami hoti he vah samaan nahin hoti
 The absorption of X-rays is higher in some solids and less in some substances
 prayog dwaara yah fal praapt hua ki kisi thos vishesh kii bhinn bhinn motaayiyon main se yadi eksre paar jaae, to nirgat eksre ko tivrata, praarambhik tivrata or thos padaarth kii motaai, in teenon main nimnlikhit sameekaran ke anusaar sambandh rahata he : log = - m × thickness --- yahan = eksre kii praarambhik tivrata; i = intensity of x-ray after crossing through solid material; m = ek sthiraank, jisko 'avasorana gunak' kehete hai
 This constant is called that solid's special x-ray-absorption-multiplier
 vastut: yah rekhiy gunak he
 To express it broadly, it is divided into the density of that solid substance and thus the absorption coefficient obtained is called 'code-absorption-factor'
 at: mmass = m / density sanhati-avasorana-gunak kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki vah avasorak padaarth kaa lakshanik gundharm he
 For example, the linear absorption-multiplier of water and steam is different, because water is liquid and steam is gas
 parantu jal tathaa bhaap kaa eksre sanhati-avasorana-gunank samaan hi hota he, kyonki jal tathaa bhaap ke rasinic sanrachak abhinn hai arthath hydrogen tathaa oxijan
 The variation of the properties of light and x-rays is very clear from the code-absorption-multiplier
 saadhaarant: drav or thos padaarth prakaash ke liye swayan apaardarshee athwa parbhasak hote hai
 Diamond is transparent and graphite opaque to light, but the codon-absorption-coefficient of X-ray remains the same for diamond and graphite, as these two materials are essentially different forms of carbon
 eksre nalika se jo sampurna eksre praapt hote hai, un sabakaa avasorana-gunak mukhyat: vidyudvibhav or avasorak parade kii dhaatu kaa parmaanu-kramank, in donon par nirbhar rahata he
 As the voltage increases, the penetration or hardness of the x-ray produced increases
 sameekaran se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kisi ek thos padaarth ke liye avasorana gunak sab motaayiyon ke liye sthir rahegaa
 But in direct use, the low passable portion of radiation received from the x-ray tube is completely absorbed in the first levels of the absorber screen
 keval adhik praveshkshmata ke eksre avasorana parade ke antim staron tak pahunch pate hai
 It is clear that the absorption factor of the x-ray entering the absorption screen is higher than the absorption factor of the x-ray crossing the absorption screen
 jab samast eksre kaa avasorana gunak samaan hota he tab unako samang eksre kehete hai
 Thus the amount of X-rays is measured by their intensity and their characteristic by their absorption-multiplier
 jis padaarth se prakaash aata he us padaarth ko ham dekh sakate hai, kyonki prakaash kirnon kii ek kriya hamaari aankh ke roopaadhar par hoti he
 This type of action is not by X-ray, so X-rays are not visible
 itnaa hi nahin, aankhon par tathaa sharir ke anya angon par eksre kii kriya atyant hanikaarak hoti he
 Due to the action of X-rays on living cells for a sufficient period of time, they are reduced
 eksre sharir ke charm main se saralata se paar ho jate hai or bheetar ke jivit koshaaon par inaki paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se unke mrit ho jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Again, X-ray effects are durable; Therefore, X-ray activity continues at different places at the same place of the body, and in some periods, cancer-like refractory diseases occur
 at: eksre kaa upyog karte samay atyant saavdhaanee se kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Special tools are used to protect the body
 iske atirikt eksre kaa nity upyog karanevaale vartmaan kaal main ek eksre-maatra-maapi apni jeb main rakhte hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki vikiran kii kitni maatra karmchaaree ke upar kaary kar chuki he
 This lethal property of X-rays is also used in other diseases; For example, if harmful pathogens grow in any part of the body, they can be destroyed by using X-rays on them
 eksre kaa ayurvigyaan main, visheshat: shalyakarm main, adhik upyog hota he
 The possibility of this type of use was evident from the time of X-ray's invention
 sharir ke bhinn-bhinn avyavon ke avasorana-gunak vibhinn hote hai; at: sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag main se eksre paar karke photo lene se asthiyaan tathaa anya ghatak pruthak pruthak dikhaai dete hai 
 Therefore, X-ray photographs are very useful before surgery, or to find out what condition the disease is in
 eksre ke utpaadan main pragati hone par unka upyog udyogon main bhi hone laga or vartmaan kaal main dhaatuvigyaan main eksre kaa upyog aavashyak ho gaya he
 Energy is either combined with particles or combined with waves
 kisi udgam se urja kaa visarjan hota ho to is urja kaa astitv saadhaarant: vidyucchambukiy tarangon kii tivrata main, athwa electron, proton, neutron, aayan ityadi kanon kii gatij urja ke rup main, vyakt hota he
 The patterns of wave and particle are different; Therefore, they are usually kept in different categories
 kintu anek prayogon ke falon se yah spasht ho gaya he ki in virgon kaa bandhan tarangon main kanon ke gun hai or, vilomat: kanon main bhi tarangon ke gun hai
 This duality form began with the principle of the heat of the Planck
 eksre ke gun bhi is dwait rup ke apwaad nahin hai
 X-rays have certain properties of waves and certain properties are also of particles
 pehle ham tarangeey gunon par vichaar karenge
 From the fruits of early experiments, it was clear that X-rays and light have properties comparable
 eksre tathaa prakaash kii kirnon kaa dik main saral rekhaon main prachaaran hota he
 Like light, the intensity of an x-ray is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance
 photo pattica par honevaali kriya tathaa gas main kiye gaye ynikaran ke gunon main bhi donon main samya he
 In 1905 AD, by experiment, Marx proved that the velocity of the x-ray is the same as the velocity of light — that is, 3 × 10 ° cm per second
 vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey kshetron main eksre aprabhavit rahete hai
 It was clear from all these properties that X-rays are electromagnetic in nature, not light charged particles
 bhed keval tarangadairghyo main ho saktaa he
 From the experiments of scientists such as Haga, Windt, Walters, Pol, Sommerfeld, etc
, it could be inferred that the wavelength of the x-ray was 1 × 10–8 cm
 Is near kintu pratham nirnayaatmak fal lave, freederish tathaa kniping ke prayogon se praapt hua or eksre kii tarangadairghy pramanit hui
 After this experiment, several attempts were made to clarify the wavelength of the X-ray and to obtain experimental results of other results in relation to it and to obtain experimental results of other dimensions with respect to it
 eksre kaa tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghy se bahut kam hone ke kaaran jin prayogon dwaara prakaash kaa tarangadairghy saralata se mapa ja saktaa he, vaise prayog eksre ke liye karne main anek kathinaaiyaan upasthit hoti hai
 However, in the present times, experiments like X-ray interference, diffraction, polarization, etc
 have been successful, and the wavelengths of the X-rays have been known to be as high as the optical waves
 jin prayogon se eksre kii tarangaprakruti pramanit hoti he unamem se kuch neeche die ja rahe hai- X-rays are particularly helpful in finding the crystalline structure
 chikitsiya upyogon ke alaava bhi eksre kaa anekon prakaar se upyog kiya jaataa he
 Due to the unique properties of X-rays, they are widely used in many branches of science and in various industries
 udyogon main, visheshat: nirmaan tathaa nirmit padaartho ke gunon ke niyantran main, eksre kaa bahut upyog hota he
 Intrinsic errors of manufactured materials can be easily detected by X-ray photographs
 vimaan tathaa usee prakaar ke sadhano ke yantron main ati teevr veg tathaa charam bhautik paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa hai; aise yantron ke nirmaan main prayek avyav antarbahya nirdosh tathaa yatharth hona chahie
 Each such component is tested with an X-ray and the defective components are discarded
 dhaatu eksre kaa avasorana karte hai, at: dhaatuon ke antarbhaagon kii pariksha ke liye mridu eksre anupyukt hote hai
 Extremely high-voltage X-rays are required for large-sized metallic materials
 dhaatu vigyaan tathaa dhatugaveshna main eksre atyant upyogi hai
 Metals are also crystalline, but their crystals are fine and they are set up in the desired way, so the lave-statue of metals usually has a concentric circle
 prayek vartual ek samaan tivrata kaa hota he, kintu kisi bhautik kriya se kanon ke aakaaron main vruddhi ho jane par in vartualon main bindu bhi aate hai
 Therefore, by X-ray interference, it is known exactly what the particles of metallic particles are and how their shape is like
 is gyaan kaa dhaatuvigyaan main atyant mahatv he
 At the time of making metal materials, heat causes them to become insoluble
 dhaatu ko modane se bhi usamen antarvikruti ho jaati he
 Such distortions can be analyzed by X-ray
 is prakaar vishisht gunon se yukt nirdosh dhaatu praapt karne main eksre kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 Among other uses of X-rays, the X-ray microscope is notable
 eksre ke tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghyo se sookshm hote hai, at: eksre sookshmdarshi ko prakaash sookshmdarshi se adhik prabhaavshaalee hona chahie
 In 1948, Kirkpatrick's efforts to focus X-rays were partially successful
 is reeti se tathaa anya ritiyon se pratibimb kaa aavardhan karne ke praytn ab praayogic avasthaa paar kar chuke hai or anek nirmaataaon dwaara nirmit kai prakaar ke eksre sookshmdarshi sulabh hai
 Things that cannot be detected with light microscope are easily understood by X-ray microscope

 vidhishastra yaa nyaayashastra, vidhi kaa siddhanth, adhyayan va darshan hai
 This includes all legal principles that make laws
 vidhishastra ke vidwaan, jinhen jurist yaa vidhik siddhantavaadi bhi kaha jaataa hai, vidhi, vidhik karann, vidhik pranali or vidhik sansthaaon ke prakruti kii gahari samaj praapt kar paane kii aashaa rakhte hai
 Jurisprudence as a science of law, is a special kind of research about law
 saadhaaran arth main samast vaidhanik siddhant vidhishastra main antarnihit hai
 Jurisprudence "jurisprudence" ie Juris = Legislation, Prudence = Knowledge
 is arth main kanoon kii sari pustaken vidhishastra kii pustaken hai
 In this context, the only meaning of the law is the general law of the country, which is completely separate from the rules, which are called law because of their resemblance to law
 yadi ham vigyaan shabd kaa prayog iske adhik se adhik vyapak rup main kare jisamen bauddhik anusandhan ke kisi bhi vishay kaa gyaan ho jaae to ham kah sakate hai ki vidhishastra desh ke saadhaaran kanoon kaa vigyaan he
 The oldest Indian jurisprudence is present in many texts of theology, such as Bodhoyan's theology
 vidhi main maanav ko bhaavnaatmak sambal pradaan karne va prakruti dwaara pradutt sukh-suvidhaon ke samyak upbhog hetu samaan adhikaar he
 This method, protected in human interest by law, is called "natural law"
 alpian -"daivi or maanviya vastuon kaa gyaan, uchit evam anuchit vastuon kaa vigyaan" Jurisprudence is divided into three branches - vaidhanik abhidarshan kaa uddeshy he kisi prastaavit vidhi kii pranali ke tathy ko, chaahe vah vartmaan ho athwa bhootkaal main iskaa astitv rahaa ho, upasthit karnaa
 The purpose of statutory history is to present the historical process by which a law system has developed or occurred
 vidhinirmaan ke siddhant kaa uddeshy he kanoon ko upasthit karnaa-vah kanoon nahin jo vartmaan he yaa bhootkaal main tha, balki vah kanoon jo desh, kaal, paatr ke anusaar hona uchit he
 Jurisprudence does not expect the present or past of any legal system, it is related to its ideal future
 vidhishastra siddhanth ke teen ang hote hai- vishleshnatmak vidhishastra, aitihaasik vidhishastra, evam naitik vidhishastra
 The analytical branch consists of philosophical or general ideas of systematic legal theory; The historical branch contains the philosophical or general part of the legal history; The moral branch contains philosophical principles of legislation
 kintu ye teenon shakhaayen paraspar sambhddha hai
 Therefore, separating them from each other cannot consider them
 dekhen, vishleshnatmak vidhishastra The purpose of analytical jurisprudence is - 'analysis of fundamental principles of legislation'
 inke aitihaasik udgam, vikaas, naitik bhav athwa manyata par is prasang main vichaar aavashyak hota he
 The following topics are covered under this- mulat: vidhaan ke saadhaaran siddhanton ke udgam evam unke vikaas se sambhddha he
 The sources by which the ordinary legislation of the country is affected are also within its limits
 anya shabdon main, yah vidhaan ke mul siddhant evam unki paddati kii bhaavana kaa itihaas he
 Ethical jurisprudence treats the law in terms of moral seriousness and its completeness
 kanoon kii pranali ke bauddhik tatv athwa iske aitihaasik vikaas se ise koi prayojan nahin he
 The purpose of the legislation and to what extent and in what form it is fulfilled, this is its subject
 saadhaarant: iskaa lakshya evam uddeshy kisi raajnneetik ferme ke antargat rajya kii bhautik shakti dwaara nyaay kaa paalan karne main he
 Hence, moral jurisprudence looks at how far the principle of justice is related to legislation
 yah naitik evam vaidhanik darshan kaa milanbindu he
 Justice in its general form is related to morality or moral philosophy
 apane vishesh rup main nyaay, desh ke kanoon kii antim shrunkhlaa ke rup main vaidhanik darshan kii us shakha se sambhddha he, jise naitik vidhishastra kehete hai
 General within its periphery: The following topics fall under- dekhen, tulanaatmak vidhishastra In different countries of the world, jurisprudence has been defined in some different forms
 germany ke vidhaan main vidhishastra kanoon kaa motamoti vah paryaay he, jiskaa lakshya vaigyanik adhyayan hota he
 In the French legislation, this gives a sense of jurisdiction of the court, which distorts and develops the "code" of the law
 angreji evam amareeki vidhaan main sannihit hai
 Sanatana is based on theology in Indian legislation
 "dharm" kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit rup main kii gai he- That is, Vedas, Smriti, Virtue and Suniti are the origin of religion
 "dharm" vyapak shabd he
 From religious, moral, social and legal point of view, it is a collection of duties and responsibilities of man
 dharmik evam dharm nirpeksh bhaavana ke bich vibhaajan rekha sthapit nahin kii ja sakati, kyonki kitne hi vishay aise hai jo dharmik evam sansaarik donon hai
 The eternal religion of India is not based on the order of the king or ruler
 isaki manyata isi main antarnihit he
 Smritiks and their ancestors have stated that “dharma is the gift of God
 yah raajaaon kaa raja he
 No one is more powerful than this
 isaki sahaayta se shaktiheen bhi shaktishaalee se apana adhikaar le sakate hai
 The king is not the creator of justice, only its foster
 " According to the theory of jurist Austin Kinwa Bentham, most of Sanatana Dharma will be embedded in morality, because this "religion" is not the order of a king or sovereign ruler
 yah satya he ki smriti apane tain kanoon nahin he, kyonki ise na to vyavasthapika sabha ne banaaya or na rajya ne ghoshit kiya
 But it was valid on the principle of Jas Receptum, that is, society had accepted it
 at: ek mat ke anusaar smriti ke kanoon kaa udgam samaaj hi he
 a part of it is moral order, the source of which is considered natural and the relic is tradition and virtue
 smritikaron ke vyaktitv evam sammaan tathaa suniti par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran smriti ke vachanon kii manyata hi inke vaidhanik vyadesh kaa praadhikaar he
 When the authentic version of Kautilya's Arthashastra was published, a controversy arose whether the legislative legislation in India was at any time more valid than the law declared by theology
 kautilya ne kaha he ki vidhaan chaar stambhon par aadhaarit he- Of these, the latter basis is more powerful than the preceding basis, but it is worth remembering that no fundamental order or practice alleged in theology by the royal edict was violated
 kautilya ne bhi saidhantik rup main yah sweekaar kiya tha ki rajanirmit vidhaan dharamshastra kii paridhi se baahar nahin he
 See, Legal Sociology 19veen shatabdi ke aarambh main francisi darshanik august kont ne soshiyalogy shabd kaa namakaran kiya
 Sociology is largely a study of society
 samajashastri ke adhyayan main vidhaan bhi sammilit he kintu uskaa drushtikon se bhinn he
 The lawyer, as advocate or adjudicator, sees the rules that the general public should emulate
 samajashastravetta yah dekhtaa he ki ye niyam kya hai
 To some extent both can follow, because in reality these rules are indicative of the desired character
 kintu samajashastravetta ko vaastavik charitra main adhik utsukata rahati he, vaanchit charitra ke vichaar main nahin
 Statutory sociology is also called criminology
 yah aparaadhon ke kaaran, aparaadhiyon ke charitra, vibhinn prakaar ke dandon kaa aparaadhiyon par prabhaav - visheshat: kahan tak dandon se aparaadh ke ghatane par prabhaav padataa he - in sab kaa adhyayan karata he
 This facilitates the reform of the law
 samand ke anusaar vidhishastra ke adhyayan kii apni abhyaantarik ruchi he jiske kaaran isaki tulana kisi gambhir gyaan kii shakha se kii ja sakati he
 In fact there is a natural attraction of inference and theory
 vidhishastrik anusandhan vidhik, raajnneetik, saamaajik aadi vichaaron ko prabhavit karte hai atev vidhishastra kaa adhyayan mahatvapurn he
 The study of jurisprudence increases the intensity of contemplation of human beings
 diase ke anusaar yah vidhi-vetta ko siddhanth or jivan prakaash laan kaa suavasar detaa he kyonki yah saamaajik vigyaan ke sambandh main maanav vichaaron par vichaar karata he
 Logical analysis of legal concepts leads to the development of logical method of legalists
 isse vidhivetta kii vyavsaayik praroopvaad kii buraai ko dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Dias believed that by developing life in the legal system, it gives inspiration to the genius of the scholar
 je ji philimor ne spasht kiya he ki vidhishastra kaa vigyaan itnaa ucch stareey he ki iskaa gyaan iske adhyeta ko gyanpurn avadharanaon or manovegon, jo maanav paristhitiyon main utpann sabhi apekshaaon main lagu ho sake, ke saath jivan main pravesh karaata he
 Laski evaluates the importance of jurisprudence and calls it the 'eye of the Law'
 vidhi kii badhati gutthiyon evam maanav sambandhon kii jatiltaaon ke niraakaran kaa rasta vidhishastra ke adhyayan main paaya ja saktaa he
 That is why it has been considered the grammar of the method
 aniruddh prasad ke anusaar vidhishastra kaa jaagruk adhyayan saamaajik samasyaon ke samaadhaan evam nyaay kii sarthakata ko avashyabhavi karata he
 The current jail reform, the expectation of human behavior with prisoners, the right to live with human dignity, social action litigation, and the investigation of public interest promises have arisen from the new legislative approach
 isi prakaar paryaavaran sudhaar vidhi, garibon k liye muft kanoonee sahaayta aadi vidhishastra or anya saamaajik vigyaanon kii antarvidya gyaan ke aadan-pradaan tathaa parsparik prabhaavon kii dein he
 Jurisprudence not only teaches the theoretical basis of the basic concepts of various branches of law, but also provides knowledge of their interrelationships
 vidhishastra keval vidhik pranali ke madhyam se nyaay prashasit hi nahin karata varan naveen siddhanton, vichaaron evam anya marga kii khoj ke madhyam se nyaaypurna samaaj kii sthapana main sahaayak hota he
 In the end, jurisprudence gives us a sense of the study, research and inference whose primary goal is the question of the commoner 


 "what is law"? Has to be answered
 vidhivetta kii drushti main kanoon un prabhaavon kii samshti he, jinke dwaara nyaayalayon main nirnay die jate hai
 The first goal of the law is to eliminate social conflicts, although all kinds of conflicts do not fall within this limit
 vidhivetta rasko pound ke anusaar kanoon kaa kaary yah he ki vah logon ke parsparik haq kaa santulan kare, jisase prayek vyakti ko adhiktam mili evam samaaj ke hit ke liye use nunatam tyaag karnaa pade

 The cherry blossom ceremony is a special social antiquity event in Japan from the time when the elites with their artists, musicians and poets spent some time under the blooming Sakuraras
 yah pataa chalaa he ki "hanami" kaa arth "phool dekhne" or gaiyr ke liye japan ke rup main jo japani samskruti kaa gyaan paas nahin he ke rup main acchhee tarah se, yah kyon ek park main kuch phool dekhne aashcharya he ek vishesh ghatana he ho saktaa he aashcharya kii baat ho sakati he
 Sakura is an icon in Japanese culture and society and is often depicted in Japanese art and even on candy wrappers
 The flower represents the rare beauty of a woman and aside from its exquisite charm, it only blooms for ten days during the year
 yah sachmuch ek phool 'der se chook ho saktaa he, "lekin jab yah he yah nishchit rup se apni tarah kaa sabase sundar he
 The traditional way to see the cherry blossom ceremony is the beauty worship of this unique blossom with parks and temples and some traditional Japanese music, dance and even a tea ceremony
 aadhunik samay main, Hanami ek picnic yaa ek party ke saath adhik manaaya jaataa he
 Some people think that it is just a time for Japanese people to get drunk with their foreign friends
 lekin, dusron ke liye, us se bhi adhik he
 The cherry blossom ceremony is a time to bond and hang out with your friends outside the bar and club of Roppongi district in Tokyo

 is tarah, tum updravi picnic-goers se batch sakate hai
 The parks are shaded with slightly pink flowers and as the wind gusts the fallen petals draw a magical rocker
 With all the trees in full bloom you will be transported in this wonderful experience
 If you look closely, the flower is almost white in color, but if you watch the tree from a distance, it has a beautiful and faint pink color
 Sakura dekh, ye mithaiyaan thodi phool spasht rup se saadagi or khubsuurati kaa pratik he
 Get Enchanted! The Cherry Blossom Festival usually takes place from late March to mid April each year
 baadhaon 'n rupais phool kii ek vishisht visheshta he ki yah bahut mushkil he bhavishyavaanee karne ke liye jab phool khile jayega

 aam upyog main, pratijaivik yaa antibiotic ek padaarth yaa yogic he, jo jeevanu ko maar daalata he yaa uske vikaas ko roktaa he
 There is a broad group of antibacterial antimicrobial compounds, which are used to treat infections caused by bacteria seen by microscopes, including fungi and protozoa
 "antibiotic" shabd kaa prayog 1942 main cellman voxman dwaara kisi ek sookshm jeev dwaara utpann kiye gayi thos yaa taral padaarth ke liye kiya gaya, jo ucch tanukaran main anya sookshmjivon ke vikaas ke virdohi hote hai
 This basic definition does not contain naturally occurring solids or liquids that are capable of killing bacteria, but are not produced by microorganisms, and do not contain synthetic antibacterial compounds such as sulfonamide
 kai pratijaivik apekshaakrit chote anu hote hai, jinka bhaar 2000 Da se bhi kam hota hai
 Along with the advancement of medicinal chemistry, most antibiotics are now synthetic, chemically modified from basic compounds found in nature, as in the case of betalactam
 kuch pratijaivik dawaaon kaa utpaadan abhi bhi aminoglaicosaidajaise jivit jeevon ke jariye hota he or unhen alag-thalag rakhna jaataa he or anya puri tarah kritrim tareekon- jaise salphonamides,quinolonsoroxajolidinonsase banaaye jate hai
 Antibiotics can be broadly divided into two groups according to their classification based on origin - their effect on microorganisms in addition to natural, semisynthetic and synthetic: one, which kills bacteria, is called bactericidal agent and Those that impair the growth of bacteria are called bacteriostatic agents
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat se pehle kai sankramak rogon ke ilajaushadheey lokoktiyon par aadhaarit hote the
 The use of plant-derived antibiotics to treat infections in ancient Chinese medicine began 2,500 years ago
 pracheen misr,pracheen unani or madhyayugin arab jaisi kai pracheen sabhyataaon main sankraman ke ilaaj ke liye fafoond or paudhon kaa istemaal hota tha
 In the 17th century, bark of quinine was widely used to treat malaria, caused by the protozoan parasite of the pathogen Plasmodium

 There are basically antibiotics called antibiosis which work against bacteria
 antibiosis shabd kaa matlab he "jivan ke khilaaf" or isaki shuruyaat france ke jeevanu vigyanivillemin ne in dawaaon ke asar kaa varnan karne ke liye kii
 or baad main pratijaivik penicillin kii khoj ke baad salvarsan kaa pratijaivik ke rup main istemaal khatm ho gaya
 In 1932, after Erlich's works, which led to the birth of the antibiotic revolution, Domec discovered proantosil
 The first commercially available antibacterial antibacterial protosil was developed by a team led by Gerhard Domeck at IG Farben Conglomerate Kaber Laboratories in Germany
 prontosil kaa gram positive cocai par apekshaakrit vyapak prabhaav dikhaa or yah introbacteria ke khilaaf bhi nahin tha
 The development of this first sulfonamide drug marked the beginning of the era of antibiotics
 prakritik sookshmjivon dwaara utpaadit pratijaivik dawaaon kii khoj sookshm jeevon ke bich antibiosis ke nirikshan par pehle kiye gayi kaam se prabhavit thi
 Pasteur said that "if we can interfere in the process of conflict between some bacteria, then it will probably create a lot of hope for medical science"
 John Tyndan was first described in England in 1875 by penicillium spp bacteria
 haalanki, unke kaam par 1928 main alexander fleming dwaara penicillin kii khoj kiye jane tak vaigyanik samudaay ne zyada dhyaan nahin diya
 yahaan tak ki tab penicillin kii chikitsiya kshamta par puraa vishwaas nahin tha
 Ten years after that, Ernst Chen and Howard Florey b
 Interest in Fleming's work took place after the discovery of another natural antibiotic that was discovered by Brevis and named Germicidin
 In 1939, Rene Dubos received distinct recognition of germicidin as the first commercially produced antibiotic used in the treatment of wounds and ulcers during World War II
 Florey and Chan succeeded in purifying penicillin
 This purified antibiotic demonstrated antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria
 isamen vishaaktata bhi kam thi or pratikul prabhaav paidaa kiye bina inhen liya ja saktaa tha
 Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological components such as pus, as was the case with the use of synthetic antibiotic sulfonamide available at the time
 itani taqatvar pratijaivik kii khoj abhootpurv thi
 The development of penicillin aroused renewed interest in the discovery of antibiotic compounds with similar capacities
 His discovery of penicillin led to the joint Nobel Prize in 1945 to Ernst Chen, Howard Florey
 flore ne puri dridhta se or vyavasthit rup se jeevanurodhi yogicon kii khoj prarambh karne kaa shrey dubose ko diya
 isi tarah kii paddati kii vajah se jarmicidin kii khoj hui, jisane penicillin main flore kii khoj ko punerjeevit kiya
 Evaluation of the activities of an antibiotic is important for the successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy
 gaiyr-sookshmdarshi vishaanuon ke kaarak, jaise mejabaan pratirodhi kshamta tantra, sankraman kaa sthaan, beemaari ke rup main maujuud saath-saath aantarik fermakokinetic or fermacodinemic pratijaivik ke sookshm ghatak hai
 Basically, the classification of antibiotics can be such that those that take lethal or bactericidal action against bacteria, or those that are bacteriostatic, whose function is to inhibit bacterial growth
 pratijaivik dawaaon kii jeevanunashak gatividhi unke charanbaddh vikaas par nirbhar he or sabhi nahin, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main dawa kii "vinaashak" kshamta ke liye jeevanunashak pratijaivik dawaaon kii karrwai ke dauraan koshikaon ke vibhaajan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This classification is based on the behavior observed in the laboratory; In practice, both of them are capable of eradicating a bacterial infection
 pratijaivik dawaaon kii karrwai ke 'in vitro gatividhi ke lakshan kii jaankaree, gatividhi moolyankan ke liye roganurodhi kii nunatam nirodhatmak ekaagratha va roganurodhi shakti roganurodhak kshamta ke utkrisht sanketak hai
 However, in therapeutic activity, these steps alone are insufficient for predicting diagnostic outcomes
 roganurodhi gatividhi ke saath kisi pratijaivik ke fermakokinetic profil ke sangyojan dwaara kai fermacological parameter main dawa kii prabhaavashiltaa ke mahatvapurn chinh dikhte hai
 Antibiotic activity is concentration dependent and their antimicrobial activity progressively increases with antimicrobial concentrations
 ve bhi samay par aadhaarit ho sakate hai, jahaan unki roganurodhi gatividhi main vruddhi pratijaivik sandratha kii vruddhi ke saath nahin hoti, haalanki, yah bhi mahatvapurn he ki ek khaas avadhi ke liye nunatam nirodhatmak ekaagratha serum ko barkaraar rakhaa jaye
 karvis maarane ke liye upyog kiye jane vaale pratijaivik ke maarak tatwon kaa prayogshaala moolyankan karnaa samay nirdhaaran yaa ekaagratha par aadhaarit ektimicrobile gatividhi ke nirdhaaran main upyogi he
 Antibiotic drugs are usually classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical composition or spectrum of activity
 adhikansh pratijaivik bacteria ke kaary yaa unki vikaas prakriya par nishaanaa sadhate hai
 Antibiotic drugs, which focus on the bacterial cell wall or cell membrane, or essential bacterial enzymes, are generally bactericidal in nature
 ve, jo protein synthesis, jaise aminoglaicosaidas, microlides or tetraciclins par nishaanaa sadhate hai, aamtaur par bacterostatic hote hai iske alaava apane lakshya kii khaasiyat par aadhaarit vargeekaran bhi hota he: jaise "sankuchit spectrum pratijaivik" vishesh prakaar ke jeevanuon, jaise gram negative, yaa gram positive jeevanu par lakshya sadhate hai, jabaki vyapak spectrum pratijaivik jeevanuon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ko prabhavit karte hai
 In the last few years, three new classes of antibiotics have been used for diagnosis
 is tarah pratijaivik yogicon ke nae virgon kii khoj main 40 saalon kaa samay laga he
 There are the following three classes of these new antibiotics: cyclic lipopeptidases, glycylcycline, and oxazolidinones
 Tegacycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, while two others are used to treat Gram-positive infections
 in ghatnaon ko vartmaan pratijaivik dawaaon kii bacteria pratirohak pratikriya maapne ke saadhan kii ummid ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Since the first major efforts by Florey and Chan in 1939, the importance of antibiotics in medicine has led to the discovery and production of research
 utpaadan kii prakriya main saamanytah sookshmjivon kii vyapak shreniyon kaa nirikshan or unka pareekshan tathaa sanshodhan shaamil hota he
 Production is done through fermentation, usually in a strong aerobic manner
 maukhik pratijaivik ko nigalkar liya jaataa he, jabaki nason ke jariye diye jane vaale pratijaivik or zyada gambhir maamalon, jaise gaharaai tak faile pranaligat sankramanon main istemaal kiye jate hai
 Antibiotics are also sometimes used from outside, such as eye drops or ointments
 haalanki aamtaur par pratijaivik dawaaon ko surakshit or acchhee tarah sahan karne yogya mana jaataa he, par ye vyapak rup se pratikul prabhaav se bhi judi hui hai
 The side effects are many, varied and entirely dependent on the microorganisms used and targeted
 nai dawaaon se upachaar ke suraksha profile kai varshon se upyog kii ja rahi dawaaon jitne sthapit nahin he
 Adverse effects can range from fever and nausea to major allergies such as photodermatitis and anaphylics
 aam rup se dikhne vaale dushprabhavon main se ekadast he, jo kabhi-kabhi anerobics bacterium chlostridium diphisile ke kaaran hote hai or yah pratijaivik dwaara aant ke flora ke saamaanya santulan ko astavyast karne se hota he
 Such overgrowth of disease-causing bacteria can be eliminated by taking pro-biotic supplements while taking antibiotics
 pratijaivik ke kaaran un jeevanuon kii sankhya bhi bad sakati he jo saamaanya rup se yoni ke flora ke ghatak ke rup main upasthit hote hai or isse volvon-yoni kshetra main jinas candida khamir kii prajatiyon kaa jarurat se zyada vikaas ho saktaa he
 Interactivity with other drugs may also show other side effects, such as taking a quinolone antibiotic with systemic corticosteroid increases the risk of tendon damage
 anumaan kiya jaataa he ki janm niyantran goliyon kii prabhaavashiltaa ke saath kuch pratijaivik dawaaon kaa hastkshep do tareekon se hota he
 Modification of the intestinal flora may lead to decreased absorption of estrogens
 duusare, heptic liver anzime lene se goli ke sakriy tatwon kaa chayapchayan tej hota he or isse goli kii upyogita prabhavit ho sakati hai
 However, most studies indicate that antibiotics do not interfere with the work of contraception
 haalanki kuch pratishat mahilaayein pratijaivik lene ke dauraan janm niyantran goliyon ke kam prabhaav padane kii anubhuti karti hai, jabaki asafalataa kii dar kii tulanagoli lene vaali mahilaon se kii ja sakati he
 In addition, there are no other studies that show conclusively that interruption of the abdominal flora affects contraception
 antiongal dawa greesophulvin or vyapak daayre vaale pratijaivik riffampisin dwaara yakrut anzimon ke adhishthapan ke madhyam se maukhik garbhanirodhak goli lene se aisa ho saktaa he
 It is therefore recommended that during the antimicrobial therapy using these antimicrobials additional contraceptive measures should be resorted to
 sharaab pratijaivik dawaaon kii gatividhi yaa chayapchayan main dakhal de sakati he isse yakrut anzime kii gatividhi prabhavit ho sakati he, jisase pratijaivik dawaaon kaa prabhaav khatm ho jaataa he
 In addition, some of the antibiotics such as metronidazole, tinidazole, cefamandol, catechonazole, latamoxeph, cefoprazone, cephamenoxime, and furazolidin react with, causing severe side effects, including vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath
 isliye aise pratijaivik lene ke dauraan sharaab kaa seven nahin karnaa chahie
 iske atirikt, sharaab ke seven se kuch khaas paristhitiyon main doxiciclin or irithromicine susinet ke serum str main kami ho sakati he
 The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a developmental process based on the selection of the organism and thereby increasing the survival ability for doses of antibiotic drugs, which were previously fatal
 penicillin or irithromycin jaise pratijaivik, jo ek samay chamatkaari ilaaj maane jate the, ab kam prabhavakaari dikh rahe hai, kyonki jeevanu adhik pratirodhi ban rahe hai
 Antibiotics themselves act as selective pressures, which allow the growth of a certain number of resistant bacteria and then keep the easily destroyed bacteria alive
 1943 main luria-delbruk prayog ke jariye jeevanuon kii aabaadi ke bheetar pehle se maujuud pratijaivik pratirodhi utparivarti jeev kaa pradarshan kiya gaya
 Bacterial life is often the result of inherited resistance
 koi bhi pratijaivik pratirodh ek jaivik keemat maangata he or pratijaivik pratirodhi jeevanuon kaa prasar pratirodh ke saath ghati hui fitness se prabhavit ho saktaa he, jo khaskar pratijaivik ke maujuud nahin hone kii sthiti main bacteria ko jivit rakhane main laabhprad sabit hota he
 However, additional mutant organisms may help offset the cost of fitness and restore survival of these bacteria
 antarnihit aanvik pratirodh tantra, jisase pratijaivik pratirodh hota he, bhinn-bhinn ho saktaa he
 Basic resistance is natural due to the genetic design of the bacterium
 The bacterial chromosome may fail to encode the protein that the antibiotic targets
 hasil kiya hua pratirodh jeevanu gunasutra main parivartan yaa atirikt gunasutra diene ke adhigrahan se utpann hota he
 Antibiotic-producing bacteria are part of the immune system from simple to complex, similar in appearance and can migrate to antibiotic resistant strains
 pratijaivik pratirodh tantra kaa prasar kshaitij anuvanshik vinimay dwaara pichhali pidiyon or diene ke anuvanshik punarsangyojan se viraasat main mili parivartan ke sheersh sancharan ke madhyam se hota he
 Antibiotic resistance can be exchanged between different bacteria by the plasmid, which encodes antibacterial resistance, allowing multiple antibiotics to coexist
 ye plasmid vividh pratirodh tantra ke saath alag jin dhaaran kiye hue ho sakate hai or asambaddha pratijaivik se mil sakate hai, kyonki ve sthananantarit kiye gayi ek pratijaivik se zyada plasmid ekaadhik pratijaivik pratirodh paidaa karte hai
 Alternatively, mutual resistance to other antibiotics within the bacteria occurs when a similar resistance mechanism is responsible for resistance to more than one antibiotic chosen
 anupyukt pratijaivik upachaar or pratijaivik kaa ati prayog pratirodhi jeevanuon ke ubharne kaa ek mukhya kaarak hai
 The problem is further compounded when one starts taking antibiotics on their own without the instructions of a qualified physician and there is non-therapeutic use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture
 pratijaivik dawaaon main baar-baar ye sanket diye jate hai ki kahaan inaki jarurat nahin hai, yaa upyog galat he yaa diya gaya pratijaivik maamuli asar vaala he
 It also happens in some cases where the infection can be cured without treatment
 penicillin or irithromicine jaise pratijaivik, jo ek samay chamatkaarik ilaaj maane jate the, ke atiprayog se 1950 ke dashak ke baad se inke pratirohak tatv ubharne shuru ho gayi
 The therapeutic use of antibiotics in hospitals is associated with the growth of multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria
 pratijaivik ke durupyog ke aam roopon main-yatriyon dwaraprophelatic pratijaivik kaa zyada upyog, dawa likhte samay rogi ke vajan va use pehle di gayin pratijaivik dawaaon kaa dhyaan na rakhana shaamil he, kyonki donon pratijaivik dawaaon kii prabhaavashiltaa ko nasht yahaan tak ki puure course ko vifal kar sakate hai
 Antibiotics can also fail due to lack of rest for the infected organism to recover fully, not to mention the interval of taking them while writing such antibiotics
 aisa karne se pratijaivik pratirodh ke saath jeevanuon kii aabaadi badhane main madad milegi
 anupyukt pratijaivik upachaar pratijaivik durupyog kaa ek aam rup he
 As a common example, we can take the use of antibiotics that relieve viral infections for the common cold, which has no effect on it
 Wrote the same antibiotics for patients he believed, although he was suitable for only one in every 4 patients
 chikitsakon or marijon donon kaa bahukaaryakari hastkshep pratijaivik dawaaon ke anupyukt nirdhaaran ko kam kar saktaa he
 a 48-hour delay in taking antibiotics for spontaneous diagnosis of respiratory tract infections can reduce the use of antibiotics
 lekin, yah ranneeti rogi main santosh kii bhaavana kam kar sakati he
 Many organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are advocating to improve the regulatory environment
 america ke interegency roganurodhi pratirodh task force kii sthapana kaa makasad pratijaivik dawaaon ke durupyog or atiprayog se jude muddon se nipatane kaa prayaas karnaa he, jiskaa makasad roganurodhi pratirodh kii samasyaon kaa sakriyata se adhyayan karnaa he
 The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and several other government agencies coordinate these issues for consideration
 ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan abhiyaan samooh kaa naam "keep pratijaivik varking"he
 In France, a government campaign "antibiotics Are Not Automatic" has been launched since 2002, reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, especially for children
 united kingdom main, kai doctoron ke clinicon main NHS poster lagaae gaye hai, jinamein sanket kiya gaya he ki 'durbhaagya se, pratijaivik dawaaon kii kitni bhi maatra aapako cirkedi se chhutkaaraa nahin dilaa sakati, kyonki kai rogi apane doctor se khaskar anupyukt pratijaivik dene kaa anurodh karte he, is vishwaas se unhen viral sankraman ke ilaaj main madad milegi
 In agriculture, antibiotic resistance associated with the non-clinical treatment of antibiotics as growth-sponsors in animals began in the post-1970 restricted form in the UK
 vartmaan main puure europea sangh main vikaas praayojakon ke rup main pratijaivik dawaaon ke gaiyr-nidanmoolak upyog par pabandi lagi he
 It is estimated that more than 70% of the antibiotics used in the US are fed to animals without causing disease
 khaadya pashu utpaadan main pratijaivik ke upyog salmonella spp, capilobacter esapeepi, esacherichia kolai or introcucus esapeepi sahit jeevanuon ke pratirodhi prakaaron se judaa hua he
 Some American evidence and European studies indicate that these resistant bacteria cause infections in humans, which do not respond to commonly prescribed antibiotics
 In relation to these customs and associated problems, many organizations, such as the need to ban the use of antibiotics in the production of edible animals and to eliminate all non-medical use of it
 haalanki, pratijaivik dawaaon ke upyog ko simit karne ke liye viniamak or vidhaayi karrwai main deree aam he or isamen in pratijaivik kaa upyog kar rahe yaa bech rahe udyogon kaa virodh or saath-saath pratijaivik ke upyog or vishaanujanit laailaaj bimariyon ke bich aakasmik sampark banane se sambandhit anusandhan main lage udyogon kaa virodh bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Public health and medical organizations, including two federal bills, supported
 europea sangh ne 2003 ke baad se vikaas sanwarddhak agent ke rup main pratijaivik dawaaon ke istemaal par pratibandh laga diya he
 Research is currently being conducted on a solution for the development of drug compounds that can withstand resistance, which can reverse many antibiotic resistance
 ye tathakthith pratirodh ko sanshodhit karne vaale agent MDR tantra ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai or unhen baadhit kar sakate hai, jisase bacteria pratijaivik dawaaon se aakraant ho sakate hai, jo pehle se hi pratirodhi ke rup main maujuud the
 These compounds can target the following including others- yogicon kii pahchaan ke tulanaatmak adhyayan, jo surakshit rup se bacteria kaa sankraman thik karata he, kavak or viral sankraman ke upachaar main nakli kii pahchaan karnaa mushkil tha
 Antibiotic research led to considerable progress in the field of knowledge of biochemistry and this led to major differences between the cellular and molecular physiology of a bacterial cell, and this was the case with the mammalian cell
 This explained the opinion that many compounds that may be toxic to bacteria are non-toxic to human cells
 iske vipareet, kavak prakoshth ke buniyadi jaev rasayan or stanpayi cell kaaphi kuch milte-julate hai
 It focuses on the development and application of therapeutic compounds to attack the fungal cell, while not harming mammalian cells
 Similar problems appear in antibiotic treatment of viral diseases
 maanav viral chayapachay jaev rasayan maanav jaev rasayan ke bahut samaan he or ativeiral yogicon ke sambhavit nishane bahut kuch ek standhari virus ke liye adwitiya ghatak tak hi simit rah jate hai

 The growth of these organisms has created a need for alternative antibacterial treatment
 phej chikitsa, jiske tahat bacteria par hamale ke liye khaas tarah ke virason kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, 1920 or 1930 ke dashak ke dauraan america, pashchimi or purvi europe main upyog main thi

 Small molecule bacteriocins can be similar to classic antibiotics; Like colicin, there is a possibility of a more narrow spectrum of bacteriocins, which would lead to the demand for new molecular diagnostics prior to therapy and would increase the likelihood of resistance at the same level
 One drawback of large molecule antibiotics is the relative difficulty for them to cross the membrane and travel systemically throughout the body

 Three armies were sent from the land route to Assam, Kachar, Manipur and Arakan and one to Rangoon by waterways
 prarambh main arakaan ko chhodkar sabhi kshetron main kuch safalataa mili, par varsha ritu main anek kathinaaiyon tathaa asafalataaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 By the end of 1825 the Burmese armies were repulsed from Assam, Manipur and Arakan, the Pigu and Tenasarim and Burmese armies were repulsed from Arakan, Pigu and Tenasarim were captured and the Burmese commander Mahabandala was killed

 Dalhousie, believing them to be true, sent Marine officer Liebert to Rangoon

 Dissatisfied with the behavior of the Burmese governor, he opened fire on the port and returned to Calcutta and advised Dalhousie to go to war
 pigu praant tathaa rangoon ke bandargah par angrejon kii drushti pehle se hi thi
 The Governor General therefore waged a war in 1852 without declaring war by giving an ultimatum, and without making a treaty, threatened by a declaration annexed the most prosperous province of Burma into the British Empire

 Lactation or lactation or lactation describes the process of weaning the milk from the mammary gland, the process of feeding that milk to the baby, and the time it takes for a mother to breastfeed her baby
 yah prakriya sabhi maadaa stanpayi praaniyon main hoti he or manushyon main ise aam taur par stanpan yaa nursing kaha jaataa he
 In most species milk is released from the mother's nipples; However, milk is released from the stomach ducts of the platypus
 stanpayi praaniyon kii keval ek prajati dayak fruit chamagadad main doodh utpann karnaa nar kaa ek saamaanya kaary he
 Males can produce milk due to an imbalance of hormones in some other mammals
 is ghatana ko navjaat shishuon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he )
 Galactopoiesis is the maintenance of milk production
 is charan main prolactin or oxitosin kii jarurat padati he
 The main function of lactation is to provide nutritional and immune protection to children after birth
 lagbhag sabhi stanadhariyon main, lactation baanjhapan kii ek avadhi ko janm detaa he jo santan ke jivit rahane ke liye ishtatam janm antaraal pradaan karne kaa kaam karata he
 From the fourth month of pregnancy, the female or female body produces hormones that stimulate the development of the milk duct system in the breasts: garbhavastha ke paanchaven yaa chhathwein maheene tak stan doodh utpann karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 Lactation can also be induced without pregnancy
 garbhavastha ke uttarardh main mahila yaa maadaa ke stan lactogenesis ke pratham charan main pravesh karte hai
 This occurs when colostrum is formed in the breast, which is a thick and sometimes yellowish fluid
 is charan main projesterone kii atyadhik maatra kii vajah se doodh utpaadan main kaaphi rukawat aati he
 It is not a medical concern if colostrum starts coming out of the breast of a pregnant woman before she gives birth to her baby and it is not a sign of future milk production
 janm ke samay prolactin kaa str ooncha rahata he jabaki garbhanal ke prasav ke parinamswaroop projesterone, estrogen or echpiel ke staron main achaanak giravat aa jaati he
 a sudden drop in progesterone in the presence of a high prolactin level leads to a fairly abundant milk production in the second phase of lactogenesis
 stan ke uttejit hone par rakt main maujuud prolactin kaa str badhane lagata he or lagbhag 45 minute main kaaphi upar chalaa jaataa he or lagbhag teen ghante baad doodh pilaane kii avasthaa main aane se pehle iskaa str waapas neeche gir jaataa he
 The release of prolactin stimulates the cells of the airway, causing milk to form
 prolactin stan ke doodh main bhi chalaa jaataa he
 Some research has shown that the quantity of prolactin in milk is very high at the time of excessive milk production and when the breast is full of milk it is less and its high level from two o'clock to six o'clock in the morning
 There is a possibility of mukhya rup se insulin, thyroxin or cortisol jaise anya hormone shaamil hote hai lekin abhi tak unki bhoomikaaon ke bare main puri jaankaree nahin mili he
 Although biochemical markers indicate that Phase II of lactogenesis begins about 30 to 40 hours after giving birth, but mothers typically breastfeed for 50 to 73 hours after giving birth
 Does not feel full
 apni maan ke stan se doodh pine vaale bachche ko sabase pehle doodh ke rup main colostrum praapt hota he
 It contains a much larger amount of white blood cells and antibodies than mature milk, and in particular, has a high level of immunoglobulin A, which acts to cover the lining of the baby's immature intestines, and invade microbes from the baby's system
 Helps prevent
 sravi iga se khaadya allergy ko rokane main bhi madad milti he
 The production of colostrum for the first two weeks after birth gives the breast milk the opportunity to mature slowly
 hormonal endocrine niyantran tantra, garbhavastha or janm dene ke baad pehle kuch dinon ke dauraan doodh utpaadan ko prerit karti he
 The autocrine control mechanism functions when the milk supply reaches a more robust state
 is charan ko lactogenesis kaa tritiy charan kehete hai
 During this stage, the more milk is produced from the breasts, the more milk is produced in those breasts
 shodh se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki puri tarah se stanon se jitna zyada doodh nikalataa he, doodh utpann hone kii dar utani hi adhik ho jaati he
 In this way, the milk supply has a huge impact on how often the baby drinks milk and how well the milk gets out of the breast
 kam aapurti kii pahchaan aksar nimna baton se kii ja sakati he: The release of the hormone oxytocin results in a milk ejection or retraction reaction
 oxitosin stan ke aasapaas kii mansapeshiyon ko uttejit kar detaa he jisase stan se doodh nikalne lagata he
 Feeding mothers have described the feeling of breastfeeding differently
 kuch maataaon ko maamuli jhunjhuni kaa ehsaas hota he jabaki anya maataaon ko khub zyada dabaav yaa halkaa dard / bechaini kaa ehsaas hota he or aisi bhi kuch maatayen hai jinhen kuch alag mahasoos hi nahin hota
 The abandonment response is not always particularly consistent initially
 doodh pilaane kaa vichaar aane par yaa kisi bachche kii awaz sunai dene par yah riflex arthath pratikriya uttejit ho sakati he jisaki vajah se na chaahate hue bhi doodh kaa risaav hone lagata he yaa us vakt bhi donon stanon se doodh nikal saktaa he jab shishu kisi ek stan se doodh pi rahaa hota he
 However, such and other types of problems often go away after two weeks of weaning
 tanaav yaa chintaa kii vajah se doodh pilaane main kathinaayee ho sakati he
 Poor milk ejection response can be caused by a number of reasons, such as - wound or cracked nipples, separation from the infant, history of breast surgery, or tissue damage from prior breast trauma
 If a mother has difficulty in feeding, then she can be helped in many different ways that prove helpful in the milk ejection reaction
 in tareekon main shaamil hai: kisi parichit yaa aaramdaayak sthaan main doodh pilaanaa, stan yaa peeth kii maalish, yaa kisi kapade yaa snaan aadi ke madhyam se stan ko garm karnaa
 The increase of oxytocin may potentially stimulate the milk ejection reaction and may also cause uterine contractions
 doodh pilaate samay maataaon ko is tarah ke sankuchan kaa ehsaas ho saktaa he jise afterpens kehete hai
 It can also experience a lot of problems such as cramps, from minor discomfort to contractions, and may worsen with other and later children
 kuch mahilaon ke stan suukh or chatak jate hai or unamem khuli daraaren bhi pad jaati hai or doodh pilaane ke dauraan unase khun bhi nikal saktaa he
 Rubbing lanolin on the nipples and areola can relieve these problems
 jo mahila garbhvatee nahin he us mahila main "kritrim rup se" or jaanboojhkar doodh utpann kiya ja saktaa he
 This does not necessarily mean that the woman is pregnant and she can do this job well even in the post-menopausal period
 jo mahila kabhi garbhvatee nahin hui he vah bhi kabhi-kabhi doodh pilaane laayak kaaphi pariman main doodh utpann karne main sakasham hoti he
 This is called "induced lactation" ie "release of milk when excited"
 jin mahilaon ne pehle bhi stanpan karaayaa he unamem phir se doodh kaa nikalnaa shuru ho saktaa he
 This is called "reallocation" ie "re-milking"
 isi tarah se aam taur par ek poorak nursing system yaa kuch anya prakaar kii poorakta se shuru karne vaali kuch dattakagrahi maatayen stanpan kara sakati hai
 It is believed that there is little or no difference in the composition of milk whether the release of milk is artificially induced or as a result of pregnancy
 shaareerik uttejnaa or dawaaon dwaara bhi doodh nikal saktaa he
 In theory, milk can also be extracted only by sucking the nipples with great patience and persistence
 iske liye niples ko lagaataar uttejit karnaa pad saktaa he or inhen uttejit karne ke liye stan ko dabaanaa yaa vastav main chusane kii jarurat padati he or doodh ke bahaav ko badhaane ke liye stanon kii maalish kerani padati he or unhen nichodna padataa he
 Temporary use of galactagogue drugs is also effective; Galactagogue herbs may also prove useful
 ek baar sthapit ho jane par jarurat ke mutabiq doodh nikalnaa shuru ho jaataa he
 In addition, some couples may also use lactation for sexual purposes
