 In view of the convenience, the walls of aquariums are made of mud

 Maintaining the necessary heat and chemical composition of water is essential for taking care of public aquacultures and also resolving problems related to health, food, diseases and parasites of aquatic animals
 jahaan uchit prakaar kaa jal aavashyak pariman main sulabh hota he, vahaan mashiinon dwaara aavashyak jal kii purti saralata se hoti he
 Fresh water is mixed with municipal water reservoirs, but the residue of chlorine gas used to kill bacteria of this water is first isolated, as this gas damages the organisms of the reservoir
 yadi jalashay ke liye samudri pani aavashyak he, to samudr ke aise sthaan se jal lete hai jahaan nadiyon se ai hui, yaa anya prakaar se giranevaali, gandagiyaan na hon
 In such places, due to storms, water may be unfit for use, so in many places there is such a arrangement that once filled water in the Hauj keeps circulating, and the filtering and fitting operations are completed on the way

 chikitsa ke liy mukhyat: jeev ko aise vilyan main rakh dete hai jisamen usko koi haani na pahunche, kintu sankramak jeevanu mar jaaen

 There is a false belief that stable aquatic flora is oxidized by the flora present in the above mentioned aquariums
 vastav main baat iske vipareet he
 Vegetation also takes oxygen from water and gives carbon dioxide at night, or on cloudy days, in the same way as aquatic organisms; But the presence of flora in these livestock has other advantages

 If the quantity of fauna and flora in any reservoir is balanced with the climate-mediated-level area, work can be done without special arrangement of air circulation

 Therefore, there is a greater possibility of this mistake that instead of giving less food, more food should be given than required
 yah dhyaan rakhana sadaiv aavashyak he ki jalaashyon main utana hi bhojan daalaa jaae jitna khap sake
 The aforementioned principles for the maintenance of aquariums apply to all methods of fishing, whether small home shelters for decoration, or gardens, or the pools of fish that are fed for food
 lagbhag sabhi deshon kii sarkaron ne, saarvajanik jalaashyon main yathesht machhliyaan banaae rakhane ke liye, vishesh matsayshaalaaon main machhliyon ke rakhane, unke andon kaa sangrakshan tathaa bacchon ke paalane kaa prabandh kiya he
 Where possible, there is also a provision for hatching and raising children by keeping the eggs separate from the fish

 ve 1 se badi prakritik sankhyaayein, jo swayan or 1 ke atirikt or kisi prakritik sankhya se vibhajit nahin hotin, unhen abhajya sankhya kehete hai
 Natural numbers greater than 1 which are not prime numbers are called composite numbers
 abhajya sankhyaon kii sankhya anant he jise 300 isapurv euclid ne pradarshit kar diya tha
 1 is not considered prime by definition
 pratham 25 abhajya sankhyaayein neeche di gayin hai- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 abhajya sankhyaon kaa mahatv yah he ki kisi bhi ashoonya prakritik sankhya ke gunankhand ko keval abhajya sankhyaon ke dwaara vyakt kiya ja saktaa he or yah gunankhand ekmev hota he
 This is called the fundamental theorem of arithmetic
 pracheen misr main abhajya sankhya kaa gyaan hone kaa sanket rind papires main miltaa he
 Detailed information on prime numbers is found in the book "elements" written by the mathematician Euclid of Ancient Greece
 abhajya sankhya kaa aglaa vistrut ullekh satravahin shatabdi ke ganitagya piyere de farmat ke dwaara miltaa he
 Format gave a formula from which prime numbers can be estimated
 farmat ne anumaan lagaaya kii jis bhi sankhya ko, jahaan n ek prakritik sankhya he, ke rup main likhaa ja saktaa he, wo abhajya sankhya honge
 Although this was true up to n = 4, the number that comes at n = 5 is divisible by 641, so it is not a prime number
 iske baad jo abhajya sankhya pe ullekhneey kaary hua, uskaa shrey germany ke vaigyanik or ganitagya johann karl fredrick gauss ko jaataa he
 In mathematics there are many number series, such as geometric series, parallel series, etc
, whose formula can be used to find a number in a series, but no such series of prime numbers is found, because it is not Does not follow the permanent format
 This is still an unresolved problem in the field of mathematics

 Maharaja Surajmal was a visionary of the Bharatpur state]

 Surajmal attacked Fatehgarh of Khemkaran Sogaria in 1733 and conquered and laid the foundation of the city of Bharatpur here in 1743, which had been inhabited since 1753
 maharaja surajmal raajnneetikushal, doordarshee, sundar, sudaul or swasth the
 He also formed a friendship with Maharaja Jai singh of Jaipur
 21 sitambar 1743 ko jaisingh kii maut ho gai or uske turant baad uske beton ishwari singh or madhosingh main gaddi ke liye jhagada hua
 Maharaja Surajmal was in favor of elder son Ishwari Singh while Maharana Jagat Singh of Udaipur was in favor of Madhosingh
 baad main jahajpur main donon bhaiyon main yuddh hua or march 1747 main ishwari singh kii jeet hui
 a year later in May 1748, the Peshwas pressurized Ishwari Singh to hand over the four parganas to Madho Singh
 phir marathe, sisodiya, rathod vagaira saat raajaaon kii fujen madhosingh ke saath ho gai or ishwarisingh akelaa pad gayamai 1753 main maharaja surajmal ne firozshah kotla par kabja kar liya
 The Nawab of Delhi, Ghazi-ud-din, again incited the Marathas against Surajmal and then the Marathas surrounded the Kumher fort of Surajmal in Bharatpur district from January 1754 to May 1754
 marathe kile par kabja nahin par paae or us ladaai main malhaar raav kaa betaa khande raav holkar maaraa gaya
 The Marathas were determined to kill Surajmal, but the Empress Kishori made a treaty between the Marathas and Surajmal with the help of Scindia
 vendel ke anusaar jarjar mughal-satta kii isi kalavadhi main jat-shakti uttari bharat main prabal shakti ke rup main ubharkar saamne ai
 After the death of Sawai Jai Singh, Surajmal proved the superiority of jat-shakti by giving Vijayashree the weak but right side against the power of seven kings including Marathas and Rajputs in the succession war of 1748
 usee samay mughalon kaa koi bhi abhiyaan aisa nahin tha jisamen jat-shakti ko sahyog ke liye aamantrit na kiya gaya ho
 Wazir Safdarjung was completely dependent on the power of his friend Suraj Mal

 Abdali, invited by Najibuddaula in 1757, could not destroy Surajmal's power through his inhuman massacre
 deshadrohi najeeb ne us samay vajeer gajiuddin khan or maraathon ke coup se bachane ke liye abdali ko hindustan par akraman karne ke liye san 1759 main punah aamantrit kiya tha

 baad main 1760 main sadashiv raav bhaau or surajmal main kuch baton par anban hui thi
 On seeing the Nabi Masjid of Mathura, Bhau said angrily - Surajmal ji, Mathura has been in your possession for so long, then how did you leave this mosque? Surajmal replied - If i had believed that i would be the ruler of this area for the rest of my life, i might have got this mosque demolished, but what is the use? Tomorrow Muslims will get our temples demolished and build mosques there, would you like it? Later, Bhau ordered the demolition of the roof of the Red Fort, thinking that he would sell his gold and pay his soldiers
 is par bhi surajmal ne use manaa kiya, yahaan tak kaha ki mere se paanch lakh rupee le lo, par ise mat todo, aakhir nadirshah ne bhi is chat ko baksh diya tha
 But Bhau did not agree - when the gold of the roof was broken, it hardly came out of three lakh rupees
 surajmal kii kai baton ko bhaau ne nahin mana or yah bhi kaha bataate hai - main itani dur dakshin se aapaki takat ke bharose par yahaan nahin aayaa hum
 On 14 January 1761, the third battle of Panipat took place between the Marathas and Ahmad Shah Abdali

 The Marathas neither had full ration nor did they have any distinction of this area, what would the war-hungry soldiers do for many days? If Sadashiv Rao did not quarrel with the small talk with Maharaja Suraj Mal and made him a partner in this war, today the picture of India would have been different
 Maharaja Surajmal still paid the friendship

 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn

 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of development
 yah aarekh sex kii dohari laagat ko darshata he
 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation
 phir bhi eukeriots or bahukoshikeey jeevon ke bich yon prajnan prajnan ke adhik saamaanya saadhan hai
 The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to understand the importance of sexual reproduction as a means of enabling continuous development and adaptation in response to co-evolution with other species in an ever-changing environment

 It may therefore be a source of diversity that is new to the population or a species
 Gene flow may be due to the movement of individuals between different populations of organisms, as the movement of mice or grasses between inland and coastal populations
 k may be due to the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations

 It is often called the "self-sustaining" mechanism because it is necessary that according to three simple facts: akruti vigyaan, sharir vigyaan or vyavhaar ke sambandh main jeevon kii aabaadi ke bheetar bhinnata maujuud he
 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height
 natural sellection kaa ek vishesh maamla yon chayan hota he, jo kisi bhi gun ke liye chayan hota he jo sambhog kii safalataa ko badhaata he or sambhavit mitron ke jeevon ke aakarshan ko badhaata he
 Characteristics developed through sexual selection are especially prominent among males of many animal species
 yadhyapi kaamuk rup se isht, haalanki bojhil sing, sangat kol, bade sharir ke aakaar or ujjwal rang jaise lakshan aksar prerana ko aakarshith karte hai, jo ki vyaktigat purushon ke astitv se samjhauta karte hai
 This survival loss is balanced by high reproductive success in men who show these difficult-to-fake, sexually selected traits
