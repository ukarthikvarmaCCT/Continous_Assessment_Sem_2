 Methods that follow linear, stationary, and Koshi products, in synonyms in the range 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 


 and range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


, with results from the prior section
 Are embedded sisera prameya ek saral udhaaharan he
 The range 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 


 if weakly Sisera-computable is also called -comparable, while 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 requires the dominant form of the Cicera theorem to be called -comparable writes
 chunki sisera prameya ke sabhi rup raikhik or sthaayee hote hai, iske yoga kii bhi gananaa kii ja sakati he
 To find the Cicero collection of the range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


, the Cesaira compilation of the considered series exists, so first let's calculate the arithmetic mean of the partial sum of the series
 shrenee kaa aanshik yoga: And the parallel mean of these formulations is given as follows: chunki madhya kaa anukram abhisari nahin he atah shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 sisera sankalneey nahin he
 There are mainly two generalizations in the Sisera compilation: The method of sequencing k for the natural number n is conceptually the simplest of these two
 yoga ko sisera sankalan kehete hai or ucchtar vidhiyaan madhya ke abhikalan kii punrariti karti hai
 In the above the mean of all even terms is 1⁄2, while the mean of odd terms is equal to 0, so the mean of the mean converges to an average of 0 and 1⁄2 with a value of 1⁄4
 atah 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


, sankalneey he jiskaa maan 1⁄4 praapt hota he
 Here "H" is the symbol for the auto holder, who first proved the relationship in 1882 in Abel compilation and compilation; 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 was his first example
 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 kaa yoga 1⁄4 hona is tathy kii pratyabhuti karata he ki yah able yojya he; isaki upapatti neeche kii gai he
 Another formulated generalization sequence method for Sisera compilation
 yah siddh kiya ja chukaa he ki sankalan or sankalan hameshaa samaan parinaam dete hai lekin donon kii aitihaasik prishthbhumi bhinn he
 In 1887, Sissera almost defined the collection but gave only a few examples
 vishesh rup se unhone 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


, kaa yoga kisi vidhi se 1⁄4 praapt kiya jise ke rup main kathith kiya ja saktaa he lekin wo us samay par uchit tareeke se nahin samajha paye
 He formally defined the method in 1890 according to which the Koshi product of the -comparable series and the -comparable series -sensitive
 san 1749 kii ek rapat ke anusaar, leonard islar ne sweekaar kiya tha ki shrenee apsaari he lekin kisi na kisi prakaar se iskaa yoga gyaat kiya ja saktaa he: Ayler proposed the term "yoga" to be generalized at various times; This can be seen in the Eiler on the infinite series
 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


, kii sthiti main unke vichaar samroop the jinhen able sankalan ke naam se janaa jaataa he: There are various methods of looking at this, including at least absolute values | x | According to Eiler for <1,: dakshin-hastha disha main tailor shrenee vistaar karne par or bahupadon ke liye vrahat bhaag prakriya lagu karne par
 According to modern ideas, the range 1 - 2x + 3x2 - 4x3 + 


 does not define a function on x = 1, so that value cannot be used directly in the resulting expression
 chunki falan sabhi |x| < 1 ke liye paribhaashit he atah x ke 1 kii ore agrasar maan kaa seemaant maan praapt kar saktaa he or yahi able yoga kii paribhaasha he: Eiler used another method on the category: Eiler composition, one of his inventions
 islar rachanaantar kii gananaa karne ke liye sarvapratham dhanatmak padon ke anukram se armbh karte hai jo ekantar shrenee kaa nirmaan karata he— vartmaan avasthaa main yah shrenee 1, 2, 3, 4, xxrep 4 
 he
 The first element of this range is denoted by a0
 iske baad 1, 2, 3, 4, 


 main agr interaalon kaa ek anukram paribhaashit kiya jaataa he; jo keval xxwrep 4 1, xxrep 4 
 praapt hota he
 The first term of this sequence is denoted by Δa0
 islar rachanaantar antaron ke antar or ucch punraritiyon par bhi nirbhar karata he lekin xxwrep 4 1, 


 ke sabhi agr antar 0 hi praapt hote hai
 Therefore, the oil composition constant of 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 is defined as: aadhunik paribhaashit shabdaawalee main 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 islar sankalneey he jiskaa maan 1⁄4 praapt hota he
 Other types of computability are also embedded in the Eiler compiler
 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 ko nimnavat likhaa ja saktaa he: In which the following-convergent category is related to: atah shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 kaa boral yoga nimna hoga: Sachaev and Vyczinsky arrived at the result 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 = 1⁄4 with the help of two physical principles: minimal relaxation and scale separation
 in siddhanton ko yatharth unhone ek vistrut "φ-sankalan vidhi" kaa parivaar jisamen un sabhi shreniyon ko rakhaa gaya jinka yoga 1⁄4 praapt hota he, paribhaashit kiya: This solution is a generalization of Abel summation which can be obtained by writing φ = exp
 vyapak kathan shrenee ke m padon ko yugmit karke vyanjakon ko riman-samakal main parivartit karke praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 For the latter term, the mean theorem is used to prove the solution for the range 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 


 but requires harder language, like the Taylor theorem
 shrenee 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 kaa tihara kosi gunanfal shrenee 1 − 3 + 6 − 10 + 


 praapt hoti he jo trikon sankhyaon kii shrenee he; iskaa able or islar yoga 1⁄8 he
 By multiplying the fourth cell of the range 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 


 one gets the range 1 - 4 + 10 - 20 + 


 which is an alternating series of tetrahedric numbers, its absolute sum is 1⁄16
 
 shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 kaa n ke anya maanon ke liye shrenee 1 − 2n + 3n − 4n + 


 main vyapkikaran kiy ja saktaa he
 The positive sum of the series for positive numbers n is as follows: jahaan Bn barnuli sankhyaayein hai
 for even values of n pichhlaa yoga niles henrik able dwaara 1826 main vishesh uphaas kaa vishay bataaya gaya: "the divergent categories are entirely on the work of devils and it is a shame that many dare to get subsets on this
 jab isse baahar aa saktaa he jise koi kaam main lenaa chahta he or ye wo hai jo aprasannataa suchak he tathaa isamen bahut hi virodhabhas hai
 Is there anything more to be thought of than implementing the following here? jahaan n ek dhanatmak sankhya he
 Friends can be smiled here
 " Cicero's master Eugene Charles Catalan also ignored divergent categories
 catalan ke prabhaav se sisero ne bhi prarambh main shrenee 1 − 2n + 3n − 4n + 


 ke liye "arthhin samanta" ke rup main "paramparaagat sutron" ko ullikhit kiya or 1883 main sisero ne us samay kaa praroopik drushtikon vyakt kiya jiske anusaar wo sutara galat the lekin abhi bhi aupchaarik rup se upyogi hai
 Finally in 1890 Sisera sur la multiplication de series introduced a modern approach, starting with the definition
 shreniyon kaa adhyayan n ke apurnank maanon ke liye bhi kiya gaya; isse hi dirikhle ita falan kaa nirmaan hua
 Studying the categories related to the range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 Part of Euler's motivation was the functional equation of the eta function, which directly gives the functional equation of the Reiman zeta function
 islar ne dhanatmak sam sankhyaon par in falnon ke maan praapt karne ke liye prasiddhi praapt kii or unhone dhanatmak visham sankhyaon ke liye bhi samaan koshish kii, jo vartmaan main bhi ek nivaranhin samasya bani hui he
 In particular, it is easy to use the eta function oil method because its Dirichle class is universally able to compile; When the zeta function's diary ranges are divergent, their sum is very difficult
 udhaaharan ke liye, jita falan main shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 kaa praturup an-ekantar shrenee 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 


 he, jiske aadhunik bhautikee main gaharaa anuprayog hai lekin yoga ke liye bahut kathin vidhiyon kii aavashyaktaa hogi

 gunasutra yaa chromosome sabhi vanaspatiyon va praaniyon kii koshikaon main paye jane vaale tantu rupi pind hote hai, jo ki sabhi anuvaanshik gunon ko nirdhaarit va sanchaarit karte hai
 The number of chromosomes in each species remains fixed
 maanav koshika main gunasutron kii sankhya 46 hoti he jo 23 ke jode main hote he
 Of these, 22 chromosomes are identical in male and female and homologous to their pairs
 inhen sammilit rup se samajaat gunasutra kehete he
 The chromosomes of the 23rd pair are not the same between men and women, which are called heterogeneous chromosomes
 gunasutra kii sanrachana main do padaarth visheshat: sanmilit rahete hai- DNA is the only genetic material
 di e na e anu kii sanrachana main chaar carbonic samaakshar sammilit hote hai : do purine, do pirimidine, ek chini-dioxyribose or phosforic amla 
 Purine contains adenine and guanine, and pyrimidine has thymine and cytosine
 di en e ke ek anu main do sutara hote hai, jo ek duusare ke chaaron or sarpil rup main valayit hote he
 Each DNA formula consists of one or more of the four organic cells in this sequence - thymine, cytosine, adenine, and guanine, and they are interconnected in a particular way
 in chaar samaakshaaron or unase sambandhit sharkara or phophoric amla anu kaa ek ekak tetraneucliotid hota he or kai sahastra tetraneucliotidon kaa ek di en e anu banataa he
 The reason for the variation of DNA of different beings is the difference in the sequence of cells
 di en e or aisa hi ek doosraa newcliik amla aar en e carbonic samaakshar kii upasthiti ke kaaran parabangnee ko adhikansh 2,600 angstrom ke kshetra main antarleen karte hai
 On this basis, a quantitative quantitative arrival of DNA is made
 praaniyon main do vishesh prakaar ke centresutra paae jate hai
 One is found in some dipterra insecta in the nuclei of the ovarian ligaments
 ye gunasutra usee jati ke saadhaaran gunasutron kii apeksha kai sau gune lambey or chaude hote hai
 For this reason, they are called Mahagunasutra
 inaki sanrachana saadhaaran samasutran or ardhasuthran centresutron se kuch bhinn dikhaai padati he
 Here, instead of one chromosome, a transverse line consists of granules that have more ability to stain
 gunasutra ke ek chor se duusare tak bahut si aisi anuprastha pankti kii sab kanikas ek samaan hoti hai or anya panktiyon kii kanikaon main visheshtaayen or vibhinnataayen hoti he
 As these chromosomes are very long, it is believed that they are completely desensitized and perhaps there is some elongation of the protein
 adhik chaude hone ke kaaran yah he ki ek gunasutra apane samaan ek duusare cendrak-tra kaa sanshleshan karata he
 At the time of samasutraana in ordinary state, these two sutras separate from each other, but in the Mahagunasutra it does not
 donon sutara ek duusare se jude hi rah jate hai
 The number of the Mahagunasutra is half that of the ordinary chromosome, as each sutra is paired with another sutra like it
 is ghatana ko daihik yugman kehete hai
 Another odd chromosome is also found in animals
 isak lampbrush gunasutra kehete hai
 These chromosomes are found in the nuclei of the eggs of animals that have high amounts of eggs, such as fish, amphibians, eggs, birds etc
 gunasutra saadhaaran diplotine-dyakinisis gunasutron ke samaan do do yugmit sutron ke bane hote hai
 Both paired sutras are connected to each other in some places and are far away from each other in other places
 in jodon ko kiesma samajha jaataa he
 On each sutra, which is called chromonima, there are granules of different lamination in place, which are called chromimiers
 prayek chromomier se ek jodi yaa adhik parshvapash jude hue hote he
 The lateral side is also made of a formula similar to chromonema, but the ribonucleo-protein corpuscles are gathered around it, making these formulas appear thick
 chromomier bhi chromonima se santat hote hai
 The nuclei are produced on a particular chromosome
 adhikansh jantuon kii prayek koshika main gunasutron ke do ekatm kulak hote hai
 a clan remains in the mature larynx
 aise praani or koshikaaye dwiganit kahi jaati hai, parantu kuch praaniyon, visheshat: paudhon, main do se adhik kulak gunasutron ke hote hai yah bahugunit kahe jate hai
 If the centrosome of a diploid animal is doubled, so that each of the sutras in its cells is like four, then such a creature is called an autopolyploid
 yadi kisi dwiguneet sankar ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to aise praani ko allopoliploid kehete hai
 If a diploid animal, whose centrosomes are K1a1b1b1c1c1, etc
, is hybridized to another animal, whose chromosomes are K2a2b2b2c2c2, etc
, then its offspring will have chromosome A1a2b1b2c1c2 etc
 k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ityadi ek duusare se bhinn honge or inamen saadhaarant: yugman nahin hoga
 If the chromosomes of this creature are doubled, then in their cells A1a1a2a2; b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2; C1 c1 c2 c2, etc
 will have chromosomes
 yah allopoliploid kaha jayega
 Polyploids may also have more than four kulaks
 yah spasht he ki autopoliploid main zaigotin avasthaa main chatu:sanyojak utpann ho jaayange, kyonki prayek prakaar ke chaar chaar gunasutra upasthit hai or chaar sutron ke yugman se ek chatu:sanyojak banataa he
 At the time of cell division each pole will not get equal number of chromosomes
 praaia: aisa hota he ki ek chatu:sanyojak ke tuutane se kisi dhruv par teen sutara pahunche or uske sanmukh dhruv par ek hi sutara pahunche
 The offspring cells formed at the end of cell division will either have more chromosomes or fewer, and such imbalance results in the cell's death
 isi kaaran autotetraploid bahut kam urvar hote hai
 Autotetraploid plants are much larger than ordinary diploid plants and their seeds are also very large, so that they can prove more beneficial for the householder even when fertility is low
 thandhak pahunchaakar, yaa kuch alkelidon ke prabhaav se, paudhe atopoliplide banaae ja sakate hai
 The conditions are opposite in allotetraploids
 yadi donon aadim matapita ke sutara ek duusare se purna rup se vibhinn hon to allopoliplide kriyaatmak rup se dwiguneet he or purna rup se urvar hoga
 For example, if the formulas in a hybrid are completely different from those of K1a2, B1b2, C1c2, then such a hybrid will be sterile, but this state will be changed by doubling its chromosomes
 aisi koshikaon main k1 k1 k2 k2, kha1 kha1 kha2 kha2, ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2 ityadi sutara honge or jin shakhaon main aisi koshikaaye hongi unpar phool lagenge, kyonki aisi koshikaon main miotic vibhaajan safal hoga, k1 k1 se yugmit hoga, kha1 kha1 se ityadi
 The dhatura stramonium has 12 pairs of chromosomes in the diploid state and becomes bivalent at the time of meiosis
 iske autopoliploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra hote he or ardhasuthran ke samay 12 chatu:sanyojak banate hai
 Similarly, the plant diploid from Primula sinensis has 12 pairs of chromosomes and the autotetraploid has 48 formulas and at the time of meiosis it has 9 to 11 quadruple connectives and 2 to 6 are divalent
 solemon likopersicon ke dwiguneet main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or uske autotetraploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra
 These are all plants
 kripis rubra aura kripis foetida main 5 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 Their formulas do not differ much from each other and in hybrids resulting from their hybridization, 5 bisects are formed at the time of meiosis
 iske allopoliploid main 20 ken drakasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran main 0 se 5 chatu:sanyojak banate hai or 0 se 10 dwisanyojak
 It is clear that allotetraploids will not be very fertile
 primmula floribanda or primmula resticileta donon main hi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare ke praaia: samaan hote hai
 The hybrids that they make from their hybridization are known as primateza kivensis
 isamen bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 At the time of meiosis, the coupling is successful and 9 bisectors are formed
 sutron ke dvigun hone se jo allopoliplide banataa he usamen 9 chatushk sutara hote hai or aise paudhe main 12 se 18 tak dwisanyojak banate hai or 0 se 3 tak chatu:sanyojak
 It is clear that the number of quadrilateral is very small and sometimes not a single quadrant is formed
 muuli or karamkalla main se prayek main 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare se purnat: bhinn hote hai
 The hybrid Raphanus brassicae resulting from their hybridization also has 9 pair of chromosomes; But in meiosis, a single bisector is not formed, because the coupling action is not successful and all the formulas remain unpaired, making 12 unicellular
 iske sutara dvigun se utpann elotetraploid main 12 jodi sutara hote hai or ardhasuthran main 12 sanyojak banate hai, chatu:sanyojak ek bhi nahin
 The result is that raphanus-brassica-allatetraploid is very fertile, although raphanus-brassica-diploid is sterile
 jantuon main poliploidi bahut kam pai jaati he par yah anishekajanit jantuon main bahudhaa pai jaati he
 Many new species in plants may have arisen due to polyploidy
 iskaa pramaan isse miltaa he ki angiousparmon kii lagbhag aadhi jatiyaan aisi he jinke paripakv yugmakon ke gunasutron kii sankhya kisi sambandhit jati ke yugmakeey gunasutra kii sankhya kii guneet he
 There are many varieties of wheat
 in jatiyon kii mul yugmakeey cendraksutra sankhya 7 he
 The number of chromosomes is found to be 14, 21,42 and 49 multiplied by 7 among the wheat species
 isi bhanti tambaakoo kii bhinn bhinn jatiyon main gunasutron kii sankhya 12 athwa 12 kii guneet 24 hoti he
 Many polyploids have been formed by use in plants, which have two clusters of unitary formulas
 ye urvar hote hai
 There is no doubt that cytoplasm functions under the control of the nucleus

 For example, the exocrine cells of the pancreas produce special digestive enzymes
 gud kii nalika kii koshikaaye rudhir se uria nikaal leti hai or yakrut kii koshikaaye glucose ko glikojan main parinat karke ekmit kar leti hai
 It is clear that in every cell of any creature, all its genes are normally present

 Last updated: 28 January 2018 dipawans ek pracheen granth he jisamen shri lanka kaa pracheenatam itihaas varnit he
 'deepavans' is an apostrophe of the 'island dynasty' which means 'history of the island'
 aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki is granth kaa sankalan atthakatha tathaa anya sroton se teesri-chauthi shatabdi main kiya gaya tha
 Many incidents of ancient history of Sri Lanka and India are recorded from Mahavans and Deepavans itself
 yah keval itihaas kii drushti se hi mahatvapurn nahin he balki yah buddha tathaa pali sahitya kaa mahatvapurn pracheen granth bhi he
 Undoubtedly, Sinhala's "mahavansa" is more revered as a historical epic, but in terms of creation, Deepavans is not only the oldest than Mahavansa and in some respects different from the material used
 george turnar ne kisi samay apana yah mat prakashit kiya tha ki "dipawans" or "mahavans" donon do bhinn rachanaayen na hokar ek hi rachana ke do naam hai
 This is his opinion only
 yadi anuradhapur ke mahavihar ke "aththkatha-mahavans" kaa or dipawans kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaae to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki "dipawans" ke rachayita ne apane granthsampadan ke liye "attakthamhavans" se na keval yathesht saamagree hi lee, balki abhivyakti kii style or kahin-kahin vaakya ke vaakya jyon ke tyon apana liye hai
 Much of "deepavans" is such that it appears not to be an independent composition but a collection of extracts from the Adhakatha-like text or other texts
 yah ek prakaar se sinhal main praapt saamagree kaa kachi pakki pali main anuwaad maatr he
 The period of which the historical account "deepavans" has preserved is parallel to the time of Mahavansa
 donon granth mahasen naresh kii mrityu ke samay hi apane apane varnan kii "iti" karte hai
 One of the major reasons for this similarity is that both texts have selected their original gift material from one place and that site is Mahavihara's "adhakatha Mahavansa"
 " One possible reason for the termination of "deepavans" and "mahavans" on the death of Mahasen Naresh is that Mahavihara's opponents had demolished the Mahavihara after getting Mahasen's permission
 puure nau varsh tak mahavihar mahaviharavasiyon se shunya rahaa
 We cannot take the creation period of Deepavans before AD 302, because it mentions events up to that time
 duusari dhyaan dene laayak baat yah he ki mahaan atthakathacharya buddhaghosh "dipawans" se athwa uske kisi ansh se avashya parichit rahe hai
 Then the Mahasthavir who has taken "mahavansa" forward has also given us information that Dhatusen Naresh had given permission to recite "deepavans" in the festival which was done to show the pride of the idol of Mahasthavir Mahendra
 
 in baton par vichaar karne se ham isi parinaam par pahonchte hai ki dipawans kii rachana chaturth shatabdi ke aarambh or paanchavin shatabdi ke tritiyansh ke pratham bhaag main hui hogi
 As far as the creation period is concerned, the fixed composition of "mahavans" is unknown
 kintu, "dipawans" jahaan kavy kii drushti se ekadam dhyaan na dene laayak lagata he, kahin kahin padya bhi vidyaman he, vahaan "mahavans" ek shreshth mahakavy he
 It is especially noteworthy that just as the Sri Lankan Pali Mahakavis of Sri Lanka kept the tradition of "mahavans" updated, the story of Pandit Ahungall Vimalakitti Mahan Sthavir has just extended the present "deepavanshak Kathak"
 Update has been made
 himdhara kisi himchadar ke aise kshetra ko kehete hai jisamen barf apane aasapaas kii barf se adhik tezi se bah rahi ho

 is shakha main paryaton evam yatraaon se sambandhit tatwon kaa adhyayan, bhugolic pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya jaataa he
 According to a definition of the National Geographic, "tourism geography" is called tourism, which acquires a wide knowledge of the culture, taste, tradition, climate, environment and nature of a place and its inhabitants and supports its development
 bhu paryaton ke anek laabh hai

 Geo tourism helps each other in exchange of information, knowledge, culture and traditions, both of which provide opportunities for business and economic development, new goods, products and products provide new markets and development of humanity
 Directions open, as well as true stories, pictures and films for children and family that tourists make during their travels

 The relationship between geography and tourism is very old, but the geographical commencement of tourism gradually
 pracheen kaal se hi log ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko gamnaagaman karte the
 Many species such as Mongoloid species, Negroids, etc
 made intercontinental transfers, but these migrations were only based on the standard of living and were a permanent process of human settlement and hence cannot be considered of any tourist importance
 jab khoj kaa yug aayaa to portugal or china jaise deshon ke yatriyon ne aarthik kaarnon, dharmik kaarnon evam duusari samskritiyon ko jaanane or samajhane kii jigyaasa ke saath anek agyaat sthanon kii khoj karne kii shuruyaat kii
 At this time the means of transport were only sea routes and walking tours
 yaheen se paryaton ko ek alag rup evam mahatva milanaa prarambh hua
 Geography showed tourism the path of development, and following this path, tourism collected the necessary facts for geography

 These characteristics may also occur in uninhabited and non-populated hilly regions and in hilly regions with a healthy climate, for example Shimla and Mount Abu in India

 Several tourist areas in the United States and Australia are examples of this
 jwalamukhi bhi paryatakon ke aakarshan kaa centre samajhe jate hai
 But tourism also suffers from the horrors of nature

 Seasonal causes such as temperature, wind, humidity, rainfall, and seasons are directly related to tourism
 is kaaran sabhi pramukh paryaton sthalon kii websiton par mausam ke vishay main paryaapt jaankaree di jaati he
 Tourists get information about the climate of that place before going anywhere

 Clear records of the appearance of this comet were recorded by the Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European rulers, but at that time it was not identified as a recurring comet

 The Halley comet last appeared in the inner solar system in 1986, and will next appear in mid-2061

 is mishan ne jo data uplabdh karaayaa he, usase heley ke bare main hamaare vichaaro main kaaphi sudhaar hua he
 For example, we now understand that the surface of the heli is largely made up of dust and non-volatile materials and only a small part of it is made up of ice or volatile matter

 Aristotle's belief on the nature of comets was the consensus among the then philosophers that comets were the result of disturbances in the Earth's atmosphere

 Tycho used parallax measurements to show that comets exist beyond the moon
 kai log abhi bhi is baat se asahmat the ki dhoomaketu vastav main surya kii parikrama karte he or wein maanate the ki dhumaketu sidhe path kaa paalan karte hue soramandal se hokar guzarate he
 In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his Principia, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion

 His belief was later found to be correct

 Finally, in 1705 in his Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, Newton's friend, editor and publisher Edmund Haley used Newton's new laws to calculate the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on comet orbits

 The Halley Comet return prediction proved to be correct

 Hailey himself could not see the return of this comet in his lifetime as he died in 1742

 In contrast, long-term comets complete their orbits in thousands of years

 Thus Hailey's orbit is somewhat nontrivial

 Like Halley, the recurring comets whose orbital period is between 20 and 200 years and whose inclination from the ecliptic extend from 0 ° to 90 ° or more are called 'heli-type comets'
 aaj din tak pahachaane gaye kariban 400 brihaspati parivaar dhoomaketuon main se keval 54 heley- tip dhoomaketu hi awalokit kiye ja sake he
 Looking at the orbits of heli-type comets, it seems that they were originally long-term comets whose orbits were affected by the gravitation of giant planets as well as directed into the inner solar system

 The Treaty of Versailles took place at the end of the First World War between Germany and the coalition countries
 pratham vishwayuddh ke baad parajeet germany ne 28 june 1919 ke din varsay kii sandhi par hastakshar kiye
 This led to Germany losing a large part of its land, banning the occupation of other states, limiting the size of their army and imposing heavy compensation
 varsay kii sandhi ko germany par jabardastee thopa gaya tha
 For this reason Adolf Hitler and other Germans considered it disgraceful and thus the treaty was one of the causes of World War II
 paris shanti sammelan main anekanek sandhiyon evam samjhauton kaa masavida taiyaar kiya gaya or un par hastakshar kiye gayi, lekin in sabhi sandhiyon main germany ke saath jo varsay kii sandhi hui vah anek drushtiyon se mahatvapurn he or sabhi sandhi main pramukh he
 After four months of hard work, the contract of the treaty was ready
 230 prishthon main ankit yah sandhi 15 bhaagon main vibhakt thi or usamen 440 dharaayen thim
 On 6 May 1919, it appeared before the conference and was approved

 German politicians seriously considered the treaty issue and after 26 days submitted an opposing proposal of sixty thousand words on their behalf
 germany ne is baat kii shikaayat kii thi ki usne jin sharton par aatmasamarpan kiya tha, prastaavit sandhi main un siddhanton kaa ulanghan hua he
 He said that the new government of Germany is completely democratic and is interested in membership of the League of Nations
 nirastrikaran kii shart keval germany par hi nahin, apitu samast rajyon par lagu kii jaani chahie
 It is wrong to hold sole Germany responsible for the World War
 german prastaav main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki sandhi kii sabhi sharton ko maananaa asambhav he
 Permanent peace cannot be established by crushing and enslaving a large nation
 mitrarashtron ne germany ke prastaavon par vichaar kiya or kuch chote-mote parivartan ke baad germany ko paanch dinon ke bheetar hi sanshodhit sandhi par hastakshar karne ko kaha gaya
 This time Germany was not given the opportunity to submit any amendment or request regarding the terms of the treaty
 mitrarashtron ne spasht kar diya tha ki hastakshar nahin karne kaa arth germany par punah akraman hoga
 Finally, the German government accepted the signing of the treaty

 The first part of the treaty is related to this

 For this, he was ready to make any sacrifice and in the end it was due to his hard efforts that the League of Nations was created
 wilson ko chhodkar mitrarashtra ke anya pratinidhiyon kaa yah vichaar tha ki rashtrasang sambandhi baton ko varsay-sandhi ke antargat rakhana aavashyak nahin he
 Eventually Wilson agreed and the Constitution of the League of Nations was placed under the Treaty of Versailles

 It was meant that the welfare and development of the countries which are very backward

 It was because of Wilson's influence that the League of Nations was placed in the Treaty of Warsaw
 rashtrasang kaa uddeshy anterrashtriya sahyog evam suraksha ko kaayam karnaa tha
 In many treaties in world history, the Treaty of Versailles has been the most described and disputed
 vastutah is sandhi ne vishwa itihaas kii dhara ko gahare rup se prabhavit kiya
 These treaties are sharply criticized and understood as the seeds of this Second World War
 nimna binduon ke tahat is sandhi kii aalochana ko dekha ja saktaa he- 1
 Accused Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw is known as the "accusatory peace", that is, the "accusatory treaty"
 sandhi ko taiyaar karte samay sammelan main germany ko sthaan nahin diya gaya
 This was the order of the Allies which Germany had no other remedy except to accept
 german pratinidhiyon ke dwaara sikaayat karne par bhi unhen dhamkee di gayi kii yadi ve paanch din ke andar sandhi par hastakshar nahin kiye to unke khilaaf punah akraman kar diya jaayegaa
 Therefore, it sat on the mind of Germany that it is an alleged treaty which they are not obliged to obey
 yahi vajah he ki germany ne aage chalakar sandhi praavdhaanon ko thukraa diya
 2
 No peace of public, peace of diplomats: The provisions mentioned in the Treaty of Versailles could not fulfill the interests and aspirations of the general public
 isamen kai aisi pradeshik vyavasthaayen thi jisamen sanshodhan kii jarurat thi
 Several provisions were made in compensation that could not be recovered without causing devastating blow to the industrial revival of Europe
 is tarah jansadharan kii shanti kaa yah sandhi puraa nahin karti
 3
 Strict and Disgraceful Conditions: Germany was shattered by the Treaty of Warsaw, the colonies were stripped financially, the ownership of other nations over economic resources, and the military was crippled
 
 kshatipurti kii shart atyant kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 In the event of non-payment of compensation amount, there was talk of occupying the territories of Germany
 vastutah vijeta raashtra ne pratishodh ke tahat kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 The terms of the treaty were so harsh that no self-respecting, cultured nation could bear it
 churchill ke shabdon main “isaki aarthik sharten is had tak kalankapurna tathaa nirbuddha thi ki unhone ne ise spashtatya nirarthak bana diya
 " 4
 sandhi galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi : yah sandhi keval asaamaanya rup se kathor nahin thi, varan galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi
 The attempt by Germany to approve so-called war crime provisions was beyond reality because, as David Thomson put it, "mentioning this in a draft that the German delegates were forced to sign cannot create a sense of sense of responsibility
" Were
 ” duusare kshatipurti kii maang bhi asambhav maatra main kii gai thi or isaki vrihat raashi bina kisi gambhir vichaar kiye nishchit kii gai thi
 How it would be possible for the Germans to repay this wealth economically and for the Allies was not analyzed
 nihsandeh dand or muaavje kaa sampurna aakaar aviveki or avyavhaarik tha
 All the above mentioned unnecessary rigors did not take any distinct action against Germany's ability to express national dissatisfaction and anger
 yah sandhi galat tareeke se naram thi, 'saar kshetra' kaa raashtra sangh dwaara 15 varsh tak shashan or 1935 main use germany kaa lautaa dena shaayad hi uchit tha
 The authority of the Allies on Rhineland for 15 years also proved hollow
 5
 pratishodhatmak sandhi : vijeta rashtron ne pratishodhatmak ravaiya apanaakar kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 France was seeking to avenge its old defeat and non-compliance, so that the treaty made the most stringent provisions with Germany
 6
 apmanjanak sandhi : yah sandhi germany ke liye rashtriya apmaan kaa kaaran thi
 The overthrow of Kaiser William, recovery of heavy damage supply

 Clemenceau's indecent behavior with German delegates coming for the signing of treaty letters, keeping them as prisoners, abusing the public, throwing rotten fruit, bricks, stones at them, was not an insult to the delegates but to Germany
 7
 vishwasghaatee sandhi : varsay kii sandhi naitik drushti se anuchit va germany ke saath vishwasghaat maani gai
 Germany had accepted a war tax treaty based on Wilson's 14 sources, but these treaties of Wilson were openly violated in the Treaty of Warsaw
 germany ke saath rashtriyata ke siddhant kaa paalan nahin hua tha
 Many conditions were imposed on him
 lekin vijetaon ko usase mukt rakhaa gaya he
 According to Wilson's third source, the attempt was to remove all barriers to international trade, but Germany's collective freedom was not protected
 uskaa antarrashtriya vyapaar varshon tak mitrarashtron ke niyantran main rahaa
 The 14 sources suggested the reduction of arms of all nations, but the Allies severely limited Germany's military power without reducing their arms
 mitra rashtron ne wilson ke 14 sutron kaa paalan usee seemaa tak kiya jahaan tak unhen laabh tha
 Thus Germany was betrayed in the Treaty of Warsaw
 is vishwasghaat kaa badla lene ke liye aage germany ne yuddh kiya
 8
 Ideological Conflicts among the Prophets of the Treaty: The Treaty of Varsay provided a status of conflict among the three elders' opinions and objectives
 wilson ke ucch parantu avyaavhaarik vichaar, climenso ke rashtravaadi va yathartwaadee maangon tathaa lid george ke avasarwaadi uddeshyon ke bich virodh tha, baavjood iske varsay kii sandhi par inaki sahmati thi jo inke samrajyavaadee va shoshan kii maansikta ko pratibibint karata he
 According to Logson "there was intense opposition to Wilson's idealism and materialism of convention, and in most cases materialism emerged victorious
" ” 9
 Beginning of new phase of Conflict: The Treaty of Warsaw launched a new struggle for universal power among European nations
 1919 tak anterrashtriya vidhi kisi desh kii sarkaar tathaa uske nagarikon kii sampatti main bhed maanati thi
 But according to the treaty of Warsay, the warring country could seize some kind of property of a person of an enemy country within the border of himself and his allies
 yadi vah yuddh main vijayi hua to parajeet desh kii sarkaar ko apane nagarikon kii idas prakaar jabt kii gai sampatti kii kshatipurti karne ke liye baadhya kar saktaa tha
 This was a new parable
 10
 wimer ganatantr ke prati ghrinaa : yuddh ke baad germany main wimer ganatantr kii sthapana hui or use varsay kii sandhi se jodakar dekha gaya
 Among all the liberal features, it was considered as an institution established by the enemy party
 isliye germany main prajatantr aarambh se hi dwandv, ghrinapatr va shatrupaksh kii vyavastha ban gaya
 11
 Disregard of the principle of self-determination: The boundaries of Italy were not set on the principle of nationalism, nor were all citizens on Poland's land unquestionably polled

 The doctrine of self-judgment concerning Germany was disregarded
 raashtrapati wilson ke aatmanirnay ke siddhant ke anusaar europe ke anek rashtron kaa punargathan kiya gaya tha
 According to this, it was decided to create a separate system of people of the same nation, caste, language and cultural tradition
 isi aadhaar par checkoslovakia, poland, yugoslavia ke swatantra rajyon kaa janm hua
 But this principle was not followed in relation to Germany, Austria and Hungary
 germany ke hajaaron nagarikon ko german samrajya se pruthak karke anya rajyon ke adheen kar diya gaya
 "in 1918 AD, when the Austrian Germans established the german-austrian Republic and expressed the desire of the Germans to join the Republic and annex the land, the Allied States banned the annexation of the two states in September 1919 AD
 Gone
 is prakaar mitra rashtron dwaara swayan dwaara sweekrut siddhant ko germany ke vishay main kriyanvit na kar german nagarikon ko niraash kiya gaya
 According to Butlerne, "not using the principle of self-determination in a reasonable sense was an indication of the inherent weakness in the Parisian system
" ” The treaty of Versailles has a special place in the most discussed treaties of world history and its effects
 us sandhi ke kathor praavdhaanon or uske swaroop ke sandarbh main aalochakon ne ise dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, the Treaty of Warsaw was the father of discontent rather than a system of peace
 sandhi ke thik 20 varsh 2 maheene 4 din pashchaat yah sansar dwitiya vishwayuddh ke chapet main aa gaya
 Since the treaty, its arrangements were disbanded by Germany
 saath hi sandhi praavdhaanon main sanshodhan bhi kiye jate rahe
 Violations and amendments of these treaty provisions pushed the world towards World War II
 sandhi praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan evam sanshodhan isliye kiya gaya ki yah atyadhik kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 No self-respecting nation could tolerate the terms of such a harsh and degrading treaty for a long time
 atah yah spasht tha ki germany bhavishya main uparyukt avasar milte hi varsay sandhi dwaara thopi gai vyavastha se mukt hone tathaa apmaan ke kalank dhone kaa prayaas karegaa
 Ezberger of the Catholic Center Party of Germany said at the time of the cease-fire treaty that "the German race will suffer but will not die
 " swabhaavik rup se germany ne is apmanjanak sharton ko dhone kaa safal prayaas kiya
 As a result, within a few years the political atmosphere of Europe became very turbulent and the world had to witness a fierce and catastrophic war even more than the First World War
 france ke marshall foch ke anusaar bhi "yah sandhi shanti nahin he, keval 20 varshon kaa yudhviram he
 "it is clear that the seeds of World War II existed in this treaty
 1919 main sandhi ke samay germany asahaay tha or sandhi ke chupchaap sweekaar karne ke alaava uske paas koi chaara na tha lekin jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya vaise-vaise vah kuch shakti sanchay karke sandhi kii sharton kaa ulanghan karne laga or sandhi nirmaataaon ne bhi usamen sanshodhan kiye
 The first part of the treaty was amended in 1926 when Germany was granted membership of the League of Nations
 yuddh aparaadhiyon sambandhi saatvaan bhaag kabhi purnatah kriyanvit nahin kiya gaya
 Many of the war criminals, including the German Emperor William Kaiser, were punished and only a few were given general punishment
 kshatipurti se sambandhit praavdhaan ko pehle to sanshodhit kiya gaya or baad main purnatah tyaag diya gaya
 The question of indemnification at the Lojan Conference was abolished
 1933-34 main german raajnneeti main hitler ke utkarsh ke baad varsay kii sharton ko todna to ek maamuli baat ho gai
 In 1935–36, Hitler violated the provisions relating to disarmament of the treaty and increased armies and in 1936 took control of Rheinland
 march 1938 main austria ko germany ke saath milakar tathaa sitambar 1938 checkoslovakia ko milakar hitler ne varsay kii sandhi ke pradeshik vyavasthaaon ke praavdhaanon ko bhang kar diya
 World War II started when Hitler invaded Poland with the aim of breaking the Polish Corridor and Danzing Port-related arrangements made by Poland under the Treaty of Versailles
 kuch milakar varsay sandhi kii anyaaypurna vyavasthaaon ko todane ke liye hi hitler ne ghatnaon kii vah shrunkhlaa aarambh kii jiske kaaran dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa visphot hua
 In this way, the final culmination of the process of elimination of the Treaty provisions of Versailles occurred at the beginning of the Second World War
 is drushti se dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej varsay kii sandhi main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Some critics believe that the World War II was not the harsh condition of the Versailles treaty, but the laxity in implementing them
 logsam ke anusaar- Thus there is no doubt that the unjustly harsh and degrading treaty of Versailles was to a extent liable to World War II
 kintu yah bhi satya he ki mitra rashtron kii paraspar virdohi niti, upeksha, udaseenta, tushtikaran or sandhi kii sharton ko kathortapurvak lagu na karwaane kii niti bhi iske liye kam uttaradaayi nahin thi
