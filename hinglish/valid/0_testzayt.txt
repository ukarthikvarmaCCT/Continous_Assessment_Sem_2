 Namaste or Namaskar is a term mainly used by Hindus and Indians to show greetings and humility when they meet each other
 is bhav kaa arth he ki sabhi manushyon ke hriday main ek divine chetana or prakaash he jo anahath chakra main sthit he
 The word derives from the Sanskrit Namas word
 is bhavamudra kaa arth he ek aatma kaa duusari aatma se aabhaar prakat karnaa
 In everyday life, the word Namaste is used to meet someone or to say good luck while taking leave or to greet
 namaste ke atirikt namaskara or pranaam shabd kaa prayog karte hai
 According to Sanskrit grammar, its origin is as follows - Namaste = Namah + Te
 arthath tumhaare liye pranaam
 In Sanskrit, 'namah' is invariably used for worship or respect, such as "surya Namah"
 isi prakaar yahan- "tumhaare liye pranaam he", ke liye yushmad kii chaturthi vibhakti kaa prayog hota he
 By the way, the common usage of Sanskrit for "for you" is "tubhyam", but the alternate, abbreviated form of "te" is also used a lot, here the same is used
 atah namaste kaa shabdic arth he- tumhaare liye pranaam
 It can also be called "salute you" or "salute you"
 parantu iskaa sanskrit rup hameshaa "tumhaare liye namah" hi rahata he, kyonki namah avyay ke saath hameshaa chaturthi vibhakti aati he, aisa niyam he
 To salute, both hands are placed on the Anahata Chak, the eyes are closed and the head bowed
 iske alaava The word hello is now worldwide
 vishwa ke adhikansh sthanon par iskaa arth or taatpary samajha jaataa he or prayog bhi karte hai
 As a fashion, it is custom to say Namaste in many places
 yadhyapi pashchim main "namaste" bhavamudra ke sangyojan main bolaa jaataa he, lekin bharat main ye mana jaataa he ki bhavamudra kaa arth namaste hi he or isliye, is shabd kaa bolnaa itnaa aavashyak nahin mana jaataa he
 Divine love flows by bringing the hands on the heart chakra
 sir ko jhukaane or ankhen band karne kaa arth he apane aap ko hriday main virajman prabhu ko apane aap ko saunp dena
 One can also be Namaste to drown in deep meditation; It is a beautiful and intense meditation when done with someone else
 ek shikshak or vidhyaarthee jab ek duusare ko namaste kehete hai to do vyakti urjaatmak rup se ve samay or sthaan se rahit ek judaav bindu par ek duusare ke nikat aate hai or ahan kii bhaavana se mukt hote hai
 If this is done by dedicating the mind with a deep sense of heart, then a kindred relationship is formed between two souls
 adarsh rup se, namaste kaksha ke aarambh or samaapti par kiya janaa chahie
 This is usually done at the end of class because then the mind is less active and the energy of the room is more calm
 shikshak namaste kahkar apane chaatro or apane shikshakon kaa abhivadan karata he or apane chaatro kaa swaagat karata he ki ve bhi utane hi gyanvaan bane or satya kaa pravaah ho

 According to Hindu calendar, there are 30 dates in the month, which are divided into two sides
 chandra maas ek amavasya ke ant se shuru hokar duusare amaa vasya ke ant tak rahata he
 On Amavasya, the geography of Sun and Moon is equal
 in donon grahon ke bhongash main antar kaa badhnaa hi tithi ko janm detaa he
 The date is calculated as follows
 tithi = chandra kaa bhogaansh - surya kaa bhogaansh / 12
 Vedic people consider dates as Akhand based on Vedang astrology
 ksheen chandrakala jab badhane lagata he tab ahoratritmak tithi maanate he
 Amavasya is considered the day on which Chandrakala is weakened
 uske ke duusare din shuklapratipada hoti he
 The time from one sunrise to upper sunrise which is called Ahoratra in Veda is considered as a date
 pratipadatithiko 1, isi kramase 2,3, 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, 13, 14 or 15 se poornima janaa jaataa he
 In the same way, on the second day of full moon, Krishna Paksha begins and it is considered as Krishnapratipada, in the same order, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, 13,14 on the same day Chandrakala is weakened
 So Krishnachaturdashi is considered broken and Darshadhra is done on the same day as Amavasya and on the 15th day if the Chandrakala is diluted, then the broken date ends

 The word malaria originates from the medieval Italian language Mala Area which means 'bad wind'
 ise 'daldali bukhaar' yaa 'egg' bhi kaha jaataa tha kyonki yah daldali kshetron main vyapak rup se failata tha
 The first serious scientific study on malaria occurred in 1880 when Charles Louis Alphonse Lavern, a French military physician, first noticed the parasite inside a red blood cell while working in Algeria
 tab usne yah prastaavit kiya ki malaria rog kaa kaaran yah protozoa paraseete he
 For this and other discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 Medical Nobel Prize

 More than twice as much as $ 469 million was spent for malaria in November 2007 against AIDS and tuberculosis
 malaria ke lakshanon main shaamil hai- fever, kanpakanpi, jodon main dard, ulti, raktaalpata, mutr main haemoglobin or daure
 The most common symptom of malaria is a sudden cold, accompanied by a cold, followed by a fever
 4 se 6 ghante ke baad fever utarataa he or pasinaa aata he
 In P
 falciparum infection this entire process occurs every 36 to 48 hours or may be persistent fever; Malaria resulting from P
 vivax and P
 ovale causes fever every two days, and P
 malaria every three days
 malaria ke gambhir maamle lagbhag hameshaa pi
 failciparum se hote hai
 It occurs 6 to 14 days after infection
 tilli or yakrut kaa aakaar badhanaa, teevr sirdard or adhomadhuraktata bhi anya gambhir lakshan hai
 The excretion of hemoglobin in the urine and this can lead to the failure of the kidneys, which is called Kalapani fever
 gambhir malaria se moorchha yaa mrityu bhi ho sakati he, yuva bachche tathaa garbhvatee mahilaon me aisa hone kaa khatra bahut zyada hota he
 In very severe cases, death can occur within a few hours
 gambhir maamalon main uchit ilaaj hone par bhi mrityu dar 20% tak ho sakati he
 Treatment is often not satisfactory in the epidemic area, so the death rate is very high and 1 out of every 10 malaria patients die
 malaria yuva bacchon ke vikasshil mastishk ko gambhir kshati pahunchaa saktaa he
 Children are more likely to develop brain malaria and in this case the blood supply to the brain can decrease and often directly harm the brain as well
 atyadhik kshati hone par haath-paanv ajeeb tarah se mud-tud jate hai
 In children with severe malaria over the long term, poor mental development is often seen
 garbhvatee striyaan machharon ke liye bahut aakarshak hoti hai or malaria se garbh kii mrityu, nimna janm bhaar or shishu kii mrityu tak ho sakate hai
 It is mainly caused by infection with P
 falciparum, but P
 vivax can also do this
 pi
 vivax tathaa pi

 Therefore, it is wrong to assume that the disease has been completely eradicated even after the disease has been eradicated from the blood
 pi
 vivax me sankraman ke 30 saal baad tak phir se malaria ho saktaa he
 One out of every five cases of P
 vivax in temperate regions suddenly arises next year by hiding in cold weather
 malaria plasmodium gana ke protozoa parjiviyon se failata he
 Four members of this group infect humans - Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae
 inamen se sarvaadhik khatarnaak pi
 failciparum mana jaataa he, yah malaria ke 80 pratishat maamalon or 90 pratishat mrityuon ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 This parasite also infects birds, crawling creatures, monkeys, chimpanzees and mice
 kai anya prakaar ke plasmodium se bhi manushya main sankraman gyaat hai kintu pi

 The primary nutrient of the malaria parasite is the female anopheles mosquito, which also helps to spread malaria infection
 anopheleas gana ke machhar saare sansar main faile hue hai
 Only the female mosquito nourishes by blood, so it is the carrier and not the male
 maadaa machhar anopheleas raat ko hi katati he
 In the evening, it goes out in search of prey and roams till the hunt is found
 yah khadey pani ke andar andey detii he
 Both the eggs and the larvae emanating from them are in dire need of water
 iske atirikt larva ko saans lene ke liye pani kii sataha par baar-baar aana padataa he
 The mosquitoes take about 10–14 days to hatch into the egg-larva-pupa and then adults
 vayask machhar paraag or sharkara vaale anya bhojya-padaarthon par palate hai, lekin maadaa machhar ko andey dene ke liye rakt kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The female Anopheles mosquito becomes the first prey and carrier of the malaria parasite
 yuva machhar sankramit maanav ko kaatane par uske rakt se malaria paraseete ko grahan kar lete hai
 The germs of the parasite present in the blood develop into males and females in the stomach of the mosquito and then together form an ovum that grows in the wall of the mosquito's intestines
 paripakv hone par ye footte hai or isamen se nikalne vaale bijaanu us machhar kii laar-grathiyon main pahunch jate hai
 When a mosquito bites a healthy human, it sends saliva as well as spores to the skin
 maanav sharir main ye bijaanu phir palakar jananaanu banaate hai, jo phir aage sankraman failaate hai
 In addition, malaria can also be spread by transfusion of infected blood, but this is very unusual
 malaria paraseete kaa maanav main vikaas do charnon main hota he: yakrut main pratham charan or laal rakt koshikaon main doosraa charan
 When an infected mosquito bites a human, the spores enter the human blood and reach the liver and infect the liver cells within 30 minutes of entering the body
 phir ye yakrut main alangik janan karne lagate hai
 This phase lasts for 6 to 15 days
 is janan se hajaaron anshaanu banate hai jo apni mehmaan koshikaon ko tod kar rakt main pravesh kar jaate hai tathaa laal rakt koshikaon ko sankramit karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 This starts the second phase of the disease
 pi
 vivax or pi
 ovel ke kuch bijaanu yakrut ko hi sankramit karke ruk jate hai or suptanu ke rup main niskriy ho jate hai
 These remain dormant for 6 to 12 months and then suddenly appear as bacteria and cause disease
 laal rakt koshika main pravesh karke ye paraseete khud ko phir se guneet karte rahete hai
 They develop into ring form and then make bhosa and then multinuclear schizont and then many more
 samay samay par ye anshaanu poshak koshikaon ko todakar nayin laal rakt koshikaon ko sankramit kar dete hai
 Many such phases go on
 malaria main bukhaar ke daure aane kaa kaaran hota he hajaaron anshaanuon kaa ekasaath nai laal rakt koshikaon ko prabhavit karnaa
 The malaria parasite spends almost all of its life hiding in liver cells or red blood cells, thus protecting the immune system of the human body
 tilli main nasht hone se bachane ke liye pi
 failciparum ek anya chaal chalata he- yah laal rakt koshika kii sataha par ek chipkau protein pradarshit kara detaa he jisase sankramit rakt koshikaaye ko choti rakt vahikaaon main chipak jaati hai or tilli tak pahunch nahin paati hai
 For this reason only the ring forms are seen in the bloodstream, in all other developmental stages it sticks to the surfaces of small blood vessels
 is chipchipahat ke chalate hi malaria raktastrav kii samasya karata he
 Although the protein pfemp1 displayed on the surface of an infected red blood cell can become a victim of the body's immune system, it does not occur because this protein has a very high diversity
 har paraseete ke paas iske 60 prakaar hote he vahiin sabhi ke paas mila kar asankhya roopon main ye is protein ko pradarshit kar sakate hai
 They are one step ahead of the body's immune system by repeatedly changing this protein
 kuch anshaanu nar-maadaa jananaanuon main badal jate hai or jab machhar katata he to rakt ke saath unhen bhi le jaataa he
 Here they complete their life cycle again
 anek malaria-grast kshetron main bukhaar ke har marij ko malaria kaa anumanik nidaan de diya jaataa he or kunain se ilaaj shuru kar diya jaataa he
 Along with this, blood plaques are also made, but the results are not awaited to start treatment
 aisa kai aise kshetron main bhi kiya jaataa he jahaan saamaanya prayogshaala pareekshanon kii suvidhaae uplabdh nahin hon
 But a study in Malawi suggests that unnecessary treatment of malaria can be avoided if the temperature of the anus, anemia, and spleen size are taken into consideration along with fever
 )
 Testing blood vessels under a microscope is considered the cheapest, best and reliable method of diagnosing malaria
 is pareekshan se chaaron malaria parjiviyon ke vishisht lakshanon ke dwaara alag-alag nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Blood plaques are made in two ways - thin and thick
 patali patticoon main paraseete kii banaavat ko behatar dhang se surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa he, vahiin duusari ore moti patticoon se kam samay main rakt kii adhik maatra kii jaanch kii ja sakati he or isse kam maatra ke sankraman kaa bhi nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Experienced testers can detect up to 0
 xxrep 6 0 1 percent infection in the blood
 in kaarnon se moti or patali donon pattiyaan banaai jaati hai
 Also, it is necessary to examine more than one ring phase, because the ring phases of the four parasites often look the same
 
 Several antigen-based dipstick tests or malaria rapid antigen tests are also available to diagnose malaria
 inhen rakt kii keval ek boond kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, or sirf 15-20 minute main hi parinaam saamne aa jaataa he, prayogshaala kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 These are considered to be slightly inferior to microscopic examination
 lekin jin kshetron main sookshmdarshi jaanch kii suvidha uplabdh nahin hoti yaa pareekshakon ko malaria ke nidaan kaa anubhav nahin hota vahaan prabhavit kshetra main ja kar rakt kii ek boond se antigen pareekshan kar liya jaataa he
 These tests were first developed using the fermented glutamate dehydrogenase of P
 falciparum as an antigen
 lekin jaldi hi ek anya kinvak lactate dihadrosenez kaa prayog karke optimal-iti naamak pareekshan kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 These enzymes are not present in the blood for a long time and when the parasite is eliminated, they also get out of the blood, so these tests are also used to know the success or failure of treatment
 optimal-iti failciparum or gaiyr-failciparum malaria main antar bhi kar saktaa he
 It can diagnose P
 falciparum by 0
01 percent and non-falciparum malaria parasites in the blood by 0
1 percent
 iske atirikt pi

 In addition to this, some tests have also been developed using polymerase chain reactions and using molecular methods, but they are still quite expensive, and are available only in specialized laboratories
 saste, samvedi tathaa saral pareekshanon ke vikaas kii ab bhi aavashyaktaa he, jinka prayog kshetra main, malaria ke nidaan ke liye kiya ja sake
 It is often a mistake to identify severe malaria in Africa, due to which other mortal diseases are not treated
 rakt main paraseete kii maujuudagi keval gambhir malaria se hi nahin, anya kai jaanaleva bimariyon ke chalate bhi ho sakati he
 Recent studies suggest that malarial retinopathy is superior to any other test for distinguishing between malaria-borne unconsciousness and non-malaria-borne unconsciousness
 malaria ke kuch maamle apatkaaleen hote he tathaa marij ko purnataya swasth hone tak nigaraanee me rakhana anivaary hota he, kintu anya prakaar ke malaria main aisa aavashyak nahin hai, ilaaj bahirang vibhaag main kiya ja saktaa he
 With proper treatment, the patient gets well
 kuch lakshanon kaa upachaar saamaanya dawaaon se kiya jaataa he, saath main malaria-rodhi davaayen bhi di jaati he
 These drugs are of two types - first those which are resistant and protect against disease when taken before the disease occurs and the second which are used after getting infected by the disease
 anek davaayen keval pratirodh yaa keval upachaar ke liye istemaal hoti hai, jabaki anya kai donon tarah se prayog main laai ja sakati hai
 Some drugs increase each other's effects and are used together
 pratirohak dawaaon kaa prayog aksar samuhik rup se hi kiya jaataa he
 Many medicines based on quinine are considered good treatment for malaria
 iske atirikt artimicinin jaisi aushadhiyaan, jo artimisia ennua naamak paudhe se taiyaar kii jaati he, malaria ke ilaaj main prabhavi pai gai hai
 Use of some other drugs has also been successful against malaria
 kuch aushadhiyon par prayog jari he
 The most prominent factor in the choice of medicine is that malaria parasites have developed resistance to which drugs in that area
 anek davaayen jinka prayog pehle malaria ke viruddh safal samajha jaataa tha aajkal safal nahin samajha jaataa kyon ki malaria ke paraseete dhire dhire unke prati pratirohak kshamta praapt kar chuke hai
 Malaria treatment is available in homeopathy, although many physicians believe that serious diseases like malaria should be treated with allopathic medicines, as they are based on scientific research
 yahan tak ki british homeopathic association kii salaah yahi he ki malaria ke upachaar ke liye homeopathy par nirbhar nahin karnaa chahie
 In Ayurveda, malaria is called anomalous fever and many medicines are available for its treatment
 yadhyapi malaria ke aaj prabhavi upachaar uplabdh he, lekin vishwa ke anek avikisit kshetron main malaria peedit kshetron main yaa to yah miltaa nahin hai yaa itnaa mahangaa hota he ki aam marij uskaa upyog nahin kar paata he
 In view of the increasing demand for malaria medicines, fake medicines are traded on a large scale in many affected countries, which causes many deaths
 aajkal companiyaan nai takneekon kaa prayog karke is samasya se nipatane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 The spread of malaria depends on these factors - the density of the human population, the density of the mosquito population, the spread from mosquitoes to humans and the spread from humans to mosquitoes
 in karkon main se kisi ek ko bhi bahut kam kar diya jaae to us kshetra se malaria ko mitaayaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, to prevent the spread of disease in malaria affected areas, along with medicines, measures are taken to eradicate mosquitoes or to avoid biting them
 anek anusandhan karta daawa karte hai ki malaria ke upachaar kii tulana me us se bachaav kaa vyay deergh kaal me kam rahegaa
 Extensive efforts were made to eradicate malaria globally in the decade 1956–1960
 kintu uname safalataa nahin mil saki or malaria aaj bhi africa me usee str par maujuud he
 Much control over malaria can be achieved by destroying mosquito breeding sites
 khadey pani main machhar apana prajnan karte hai, aise khadey pani kii jagahon ko dhak kar rakhana, sukha dena yaa baha dena chaiye yaa pani kii sataha par tel daal dena chaiye, jisase machharon ke larva saans na le paaen
 In addition, pesticides are often sprayed on the walls of homes in malaria-affected areas
 anek prajatiyon ke machhar manushya kaa khun chusane ke baad diwaar par baith kar ise hajam karte hai
 In such a situation, if insecticides are sprayed on the walls, the mosquito will die as soon as it sits on the wall, before any other humans are bitten
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne malaria prabhavit kshetron main chhidkav ke liye lagbhag 12 dawaaon ko manyata di he
 These include drugs such as permethrin and deltamethrin in addition to DDT, especially in areas where mosquitoes have developed anti-ddt resistance
 machhardaniyaan machharon ko logon se dur rakhane me safal rahati hai tathaa malaria sankraman ko kaaphi had tak rokatii hai
 Since the Anopheles mosquito bites at night, the protection is completed by hanging large mosquito nets on the bed / bed and completely encircling the bed
 machhardaniyaan apane aap main bahut prabhavi upaay nahin hai kintu yadi unhen rasinic rup se upachaarit kar den to ve bahut upyogi ho jaati hai
 Malaria-affected areas have seen a 20 percent reduction in malaria by spreading awareness about malaria
 saath hi malaria kaa nidaan or ilaaj jald se jald karne se bhi iske prasar main kami hoti he
 Other efforts include collecting and analyzing malaria on a large scale and examining how effective the methods of malaria control are
 aise ek vishleshan main pataa laga ki lakshan-viheen sankraman vaale logon kaa ilaaj karnaa bahut aavashyak hota he, kyonki inamen bahut maatra main malaria sanchit rahata he
 Vaccines are being developed against malaria, although success has not yet been achieved

 In the event of complete closure of the artery, the risk of heart attack increases
 hriday kii teen mukhya dhamniyon main se kisi bhi ek yaa sabhi main avrodh paidaa ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, the vein is removed from any part of the body by surgery and it is added parallel to the stopped place of the artery of the heart

 This surgical technique is called bypass surgery
 praayah chaati ke andar se mameri artery yaa haath se redial artery yaa pair se safenus wain nikaalkar hriday kii dhamni se jodi jaati he
 This action does not remove the old stunted artery, but instead a new vein is added in front of the block or blockage in the same artery, thereby smooth the blood flow again
 dhamni rukaawat ke maamle main bypass surgery sarvshereshth vikalp hot he
 Another and cheaper option is angioplasty
 hriday kii kisi ek dhamni main avrodh hone par praayah angeoplasty se samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 But when there is too much congestion in one or more coronary arteries or if the subclavuses shrink too much, then bypass surgery, ie coronary artery bypass grafting, is the only option

 After this, the heart and lungs connect back to the circulatory system, so that they start working as before
 heart langs mashin ko hataa lete hai, va hriday kii sataha par do pesamekar ke taar laga dete hai

 All these tubes are removed one day after operation
 inke alaava aaparishan ke 16 se 24 ghante baad tak rogi kii saans nalee main ek andotracial taub lagi rahati he
 This tube is connected to the artificial respirator and helps the patient in respiration
 jab rogi acchhee tarah saans lene lagata he to ise hataa diya jaataa he
 As long as this tube is in the respiratory tract, the patient can neither eat or drink or talk
 rogi ke munh or naak par ek oxigen mask bhi laga rahata he, taaki rogi ko paryaapt maatra main oxigen milti rahe
 Often, the patient is superannuated from the hospital within 1-2 weeks of the operation
 tab tak uski chaati or pair ke jakhm bhi suukh jate hai
 Due to the removal of the vein from the foot, the foot may remain swollen for a few days

 The modern new method, called beating heart surgery, prevents the flow of blood only to the heart where the surgery is to be performed

 Now there is no need for long tearing
 is takanic kii visheshta yah he ki ise hriday ke upree bhaag par lagaakar isse hriday ko aavashyaktaanusaar ghumaya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, it has become easy to see the back and side parts of the heart with the minimally invasive technique
 is takanic main heart-langs mashin kii bhi aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 There is a small cut in the chest compared to open heart surgery, which is not bad to see
 cat chota hone se rakt-srav bhi bahut kam hota he or teen se chaar din main rogi waapas ghar ja sakate hai
 After this, the need for repeat operation is almost nil and its expenditure is also 50-60 thousand rupees less than the old open-heart technique
 jin rogiyon kaa hriday hridayaghat se kaaphi kshatigrast hua he, unke alaava sabhi ke liye, khaskar vridhon va madhumeh rogiyon ke liye ye takanic kargar hoti he
 According to experts, yoga is beneficial at the first level in cardiovascular diseases but doing yoga after angioplasty and bypass surgery can be harmful

 To establish their rule in India, the officers of the East India Company thought in necessary to preserve the knowledge of Hindus and Muslims
 In the year 1750 they passed a resolution for that purpose
 To preserve Urdu, they established a Madarsa at Calcutta, whereas for protection and development of Sanskrit, they chose Benares
 In 1791, during the period of British rule in India, Jonathan Duncan, the representative of the Honourable East India Company proposed the establishment of a Sanskrit college for development and preservation of the Sanskrit Vangmaya and to show that the English people were in favor of the development of the Indian culture
 This was sanctioned by Governor General Lord Cornwallis
 Kashi Naresh Mahip Narayan Singh donated a huge tract of land in the southern part of Benares for construction of the college
 The first teacher of this Institution was Pandit Kashinath
 The Governor General initially sanctioned a budget of Rs
 20,000 per annum
 Initially the college offered courses up to graduation
 From 1857, the College started Postgraduate teaching
 The examination system was adopted in 1880
 In 1894 the famous building of Saraswati Bhavan Granthalaya, where thousands of manuscripts are preserved, was constructed, 
 These manuscripts are edited by the Principal of the College and published in book form
 The series of books are known as Sarasvati Bhavana Texts
 More than 400 books have been published in the series

 From 1791 to 1844 the college was governed by the Administrative officers of the city
 Later British officers decided that Indians should also obtain knowledge of European literature and Philosophy
 Therefore they ordered the appointment of a Principal for the college
 The qualification laid down was the Principal must be a scholar of Sanskrit with knowledge of European literature and philosophy
the Principals from 1844 were: hafathali madhya asia main 5veen or 6thi sadi isvi main rahane vaali ek kanaabadosh jati thi

 caffeine ek kadavi, safed crystalabh axcenthine alcaloid he, jo ek manosphurtidayak yaa psychoactive uttejk aushadhi he
 Caffeine was discovered in 1819 by Friedrich Ferdinand Runge, a German chemist
 unhone caffeine shabd kaa izaad kiya, jo coffee kaa ek rasinic yogic he, he), jo angreji main caffeine ban gaya main badal gaya)
 Caffeine is found in varying amounts in the legumes, leaves, and fruits of some plants, where it acts as a natural insecticide that paralyzes and kills some insects that eat the plants
 coffee ke paudhe kii faliyon or chaay kii jhaadi kii pattiyon se nikaale gayi arq kaa hi bahut aam taur par manushyon dwaara upbhog kiya jaataa he

 The US Food and Drug Administration) lists caffeine as "generally considered a multi-purpose food item
" jin marijon main caffeine ko sahane kii kshamta nahin hoti he, unhen isaki paryaapt maatra dene par iske mutrvardhak gunon kaa pataa chalata he
 However, regular users have considerable potential to tolerate this effect, and studies on it generally fail to support the general belief that common consumption of caffeinated beverages contributes substantially to dehydration

 High levels of caffeine are also found in the ground around coffee bean sprouts
 isliye, mana jaataa he ki caffeine ek prakritik kitnashak ke saath-saath coffee ke ankur ke aasapaas anya kisi paudhe ke ankuran ke pravrodhak kaa bhi kaam karti he, is tarah ise bache rahane kaa behatar avasar miltaa he
