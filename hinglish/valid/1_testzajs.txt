 rupvaad kisi granth kii bhashik sanrachana par kendrit saahitiyik aalochana or sahitya siddhanth kii ek paddati he
 Language has been given a lot of importance in this
 yah saahitiyik paath ke adhyayan kaa aadhaar bhashaa ko maanata he
 It studies the text without considering any external influences on its language
 yah saahitiyik aalochana main praayah saanskrithik mulyon, saamaajik prabhaavon yaa lekhak ke jivan kii andekhi karata he
 Instead, it pays attention to the nature, genre etc
 of the language of the book
 sahitya siddhanth main rupvaad us aalochanatmak paddati ko kaha jaataa he jisamen paath kii bhashaa main maujuud visheshtaon kaa vishleshan, vivechan, udghaatan or moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 This method involves thinking about the grammar or origin of the language as well as literary applications like verses and ornamentation
 rupavaadi paddati sahitya kii aalochana ke liye uske saanskrithik, aitihaasik yaa lekhak ke jivan sambandhi sandarbhon kii jarurat ke mahatv ko kam karti he
 This theory also denies the importance of the story of any work

 Romantic literature theory gave central importance to the litterateur and individual creative genius

 From the end of the Second World War to the 1970s, Rupism had remained an effective form of American literary study

 Formalism was replaced by new literature theories in the late 1970s

 It includes the following basic ideas: roosi rupavaadiyon ne saahitiyik aalochana main praayah saanskrithik mulyon, saamaajik prabhaavon yaa lekhak ke jivan kii bhoomika ko asweekaar kiya
 a clear mention of this principle can be seen in the main arguments of Viktor Shklovsky's early writing "art as a tool"
 rupavaadi shodh adhyayan karne kaa vah maarg apanaataa he jisamen vidhyaarthee apana lekhan prastut karte hai
 In this way, the language gets the place of the owner writer

 In this way, instead of language, the teacher is in the position of the author
 bhartiya reeti sampradaayon yaa alankaar sampradaayon ko rupavaadi samiksha aandolan ke samaan maananaa uchit nahin he

 They have also considered an element of poetry such as ritual or ornamentation to be the soul of poetry, but they have not boycotted other elements but have also tried to make them complete by including other elements in their thinking

 Formalism was heavily criticized for its excessive emphasis on form

 In the context of style, their analysis and evaluation is possible

 fir bhi isaki pratishtha sarvaadhik he, jiskaa ek kaaran gita main krishna dwaara vedanan samavedosmi kahana bhi he
 Although the Samaveda is small but in a way it is the essence of all the Vedas and selected portions of all the Vedas are included in it

 May we grow together and be people

 quran kaa adhyay 
 --HINDI TRANSLATION-- sure al maaedah madina main nazil hua or isaki ek sau bees aayate hai In the name of God, who is a great kindness, fulfill the faith of the believers, for you, the animals have been halal except those who will be read to you
 Understand the ungodly God who wants to dictate, do not disbelieve in disrespecting the goddesses of God, nor sacrificing a month or sacrificing nor leasing animals Those who disbelieve in the blessing of the Kaaba, who are the joys of their family and the joys of the fajal, and when you open up, you can celebrate and the clan of the clan that you were prevented by the people of the Kaaba
 i do not make the decision that you start to torture them and help each other in righteousness and abstinence and do not help anyone in crime and crime and be afraid of yourself
 Is it really a very tough wonder dead animal and blood and pig meat And at which time someone other than God is called and the neck is twisted and bruised and who dies by falling into the well and who has been killed by the horn and who has been torn by the poor but whom you have killed Recite the word and offer it on the idols, and the one who has been killed by the arrows of yours has been beaten on you
 It is a matter of crime now that the kuffaar is disappointed with your poor If you went, you should not be afraid of them, but only be afraid of me, today i have helped your deen and you have fulfilled your devotion and i like your Islam, the person who is forced into hunger and not even Mael towards crime
 If you are a godless man, you ask me what things have been done for them, you tell me that things have been done for you and hunters Anvr who keep trained to have a victim and that God has Btayee you Some of them you have taught those animals too, then eat these hunter animals which you hold for you and take the name of God and be afraid of God, there is no doubt that God is going to take account very soon
 Things have been halal for you and the happy things of the first book, wheat is halal for you and wheat is happy for you and today Aad pak daman women and those free pak daman women who have been given the book before you, when you give them the intention of pak damini, neither openly indulge nor steal secretly and the person who Denied faith, all of it was done and in the end, it will remain in the same loss
 When you are intent on offering prayers, wash your mouth and elbows
 Go and wipe your heads and legs to the ankles and if you do If you are sick, then you can take a dance and if you are sick or traveling or if any of you come out of the store or you are in bed with women and you cannot get water, then get ready for swimming, that is, your mouth and your hands Do not worry that God does not want to put any kind of stress on you, rather he wants to cook and cook and fulfill his love for you so that you become thankful and that That God has done to you and remember those whom you have confirmed with you when you said that we heard and obeyed you and be afraid of God because there is no doubt that even the secret of the hearts Hey, the believers, be ready to testify with justice for God and do not let any clan feast in the crime that you start to judge you justice Mr
 piety is very close, and fear God, because whatever you do God knows him and those who have confided in faith and have done good deeds, God has promised that there is a great and a great deal for him, and those who have abused and rejected our verses are the people who have faith
 Remember the violence that has been done to you and when a clan had intended to scour you, God has prevented his hands from reaching you
 i gave and be afraid of God and Mominin should have faith in God himself and there is no doubt that God had taken the Ehad and the scale from the Israel made by him and we had twelve of them set on him and God made him from the Israel made
 i was with you for sure if you too continue to offer prayers and offer zakat and believe in our prophets and help them and make your own debts laughable
 So i have your sins will surely overcome you and gardens thee behistif any of you refuse even after this, then surely he has lost the path, we have cursed him because of his great prejudice and we have made his heart very hard to change the Kalamat from his real ways and use it in other ways
 Do and forget a large part of the things that they were taught and now among them, except for a few men, there are equal muttels If you keep getting, then forgive them and do it, God certainly keeps friends with the people doing the favor, and those who say that we are disrespectful, we have taken the honor of Imaan, but when the things they were taught If a large part of them is forgotten, then we have also put the foundation of Baham Advaat and Dushmani in them till the price and God will tell them very soon what he used to do
 Have access to those things our prophet who has come books God you Used to hide, you will make a very clear statement and will go through many things
 You have come to a book that is a simple and clear statement from the side of God, people who are proud of their own happiness, get rid of it through them
 He instructs and brings out the light from his command and gives way to the people who are convinced that Mary's son Christ is just God i am sure he is infuriated to ask him that if God wants to kill Mary's son Christ and his mother and all those who are in the ground, then who is the one who is stronger than God and all the sky and the ground and whatever He is also in his court, it is the Sultanate of God who produces what he wants, and God is the master of everything, and the Nasranis and Jews say that we are the sons of God and his favorites
 Veins let you say again lets you punishing your sins but You are also a basher from his demeanor, God will give you whatever he wants and will punish whomever he wants, the sky and the land and everything that is between them both is an own country and everyone has to return to the same book when the prophets If there is a lot of obstruction in the inflow, then our Rasul came to you, who makes a clear statement to God, so that you do not say that we have any good news
 That one did not come to scare you, now surely you have a good prophet who gives you good news and is afraid, and God himself is in control of everything
 Remember that because he made many prophets from you and made you the king and gave you the blessings that have been given to one person Proceeded AI go to my people that holy land Jho God of your destiny You have written and do not turn your back against the enemy, then you will incur a perverse loss, those people started saying, "O Moses, there are great people in this country and until those people come out of it, we will never have any power in it
" Will keep it, if those people themselves get out of it, then we will definitely go, the man who was afraid of God and whom God had specifically fudged, fearlessly said that by attacking him So you entered the gate and you won and if you are truly honest, believe in God
 He says, "as long as those people are in it, we will not keep a sure foot in it
 You go and save yourself and fight both of us
" So while sitting here, Moses said that you are very proud of the request that i have no control over anyone other than my brother and my brother, but now the people of our and those hated people If we cannot support Ramayan, then his punishment is that he For forty years the rule will not be destined; these people will remain in the woods, then you do not feel sorry for these ill-fated monks, you tell these people the truth of the two sons of Adam that when they both prayed in the shrine of God
 When one was accepted and the other did not approve, he said to Habil, i will surely kill you
 He replied that God only accepts the eyes of the dieters
 If you raise your hand towards me with the intention of killing me, i am not going to raise my hand for the thought of your murder, i am afraid of that God who is going to be the cradle of the whole ship, i definitely want that my crime and your If both of you are guilty, then you will become a soul and this is the punishment of the oppressors, then his nafs provoke him on the murder of his brother, and finally kill him
 If it was done then it became one of those who took the loss, then God sent a crow that he He began to scrape the ground so that he could show him why he should hide his brother's corpse
 He started saying sorry to me that i could match that crow so that he would hide his brother's corpse
 Because of the reason, we had made it clear that the person who killed a person in exchange for not knowing his life or for spreading justice in the country, then he went to all the people
 When he gave the district to a man, he took all the people and brought them to our Prophet's light, and then even after that, many of them continued to spend many lives on God and his Rasul They fight and fight with disdain to spread their fate, their punishment is that either they are killed or they are crucified or their hands are found Er back to a side of hand cut Paॅv the other hand Jaaॅ or Srjhmin them If this city was changed from the city, it was done in their world and then in the end it is very big for them, but the people who have done it before you can control them will be spared the crime because understand that God Of course, it is a great blessing, be afraid of God, and believe in Him, and live in the path of Him, and jihad in his path so that you will succeed Some people refused to do anything if they had what they had in the land, but more so with it that the compensation of the price of the doom of the day would not be accepted, and they would have painful wonders for them
 They escaped from the fire of the world, but they could not get out of there, and for them, Daemi is a wonder, and the thief is a man or a woman, you cut off his hand in punishment of his handiwork
 This is the side of God and your God big thumping Wise Ho itself After committing the crime and fixing your movement, of course God also accepts you because God is a very splendid man, do you not know that there is a special rule in the whole sky and the land, which can be loved by anyone? Do and forgive whoever you want and God is on everything, you should not eat the sorrow of those who go on the side of the kitchen, so that the hawk is such that your They say that we believe that their hearts are dishonest and that the Jews are such that they hear a lot of lies so that they can tell the other gang of Kuffar who have not come to you, even after their real meaning of Alphas Tehrif says that if you are ordered by Mohammed, then obey it and if this command is not given to you, then stay separate from it and If you want to spoil yourself, then you have nothing harder than God It is possible that these people are the same, whose hearts did not intend to cook for them, for them, there is Russia in the world, and in the end, it will be a great wonder, if they listen to false things with great passion and they are very mean If these people come to you, you have to take care of them and make a decision between them or stay away from them and if you stay on edge, these people will not spoil you at all
 You can and if you decide them, then decide with justice because God keeps friends of justice and when they have their own torture and there is a command of God, then why come to you to decide and then go again And the truth is that these people are not honest, of course we did the Taurat Nazil, in which Hidayat and Noor are there, according to that, the Gods of God are bound
 To give the command of Allah that and Ulemaa the books which he Muhafijh from God He was created and he was also a witness
 Do not be afraid of me, do not be afraid of me and do not take in return for my verses, and those who do not give orders according to the blessings of God, then such people are Kafir and we have done Taurat i had ordered the Jews that the life and life for life and the eye for nose and nose for nose and ear for ear and tooth for tooth and wound was changed for equal amount of tooth and wound
 This will be a spurt of his crimes and if the person does not give orders for the sake of God, then such people are guilty and we have followed the steps of those same prophets to Mary, the son of Mary, and he would also like this book money Were those who were present in front of them and we gave them the Scripture in which they were instructed and Noor and he wrote this book, which was the time in which the Holy Scripture was present The instructions and advice of the residents was Do not be afraid of people, be afraid of me and do not take my verses and do not give orders as per the dictates of the Nazis, then such people are infidels and we have ordered the Jews in Touret to say that my life In lieu of life and eye for eye and nose for nose and ear for ear and ear for ear and tooth, it is equal revenge for tooth and wound, then if the account is forgiven then it will be spread by its sins

 According to Nazi's order, if we do not give orders, then such people are infidels and we in Taurat have ruled on the Jews that for life and life for eye and eye for nose and nose for nose and ear for ear and tooth
 Revenge is equal revenge for tooth and wound, then if the account is forgiven, then it will be disgusted with its crimes and if the person does not give orders against the person of the evil, then such people will be alive i am and we have followed the same prophets to Jesus, the son of Mary, and he also used to approve this book, which was present in front of him, and we gave him the scripture which instructed and Noor and he wrote this book which At the time, there was a clear Scripture, there was the instruction and advice of the persecutors and dieters

 Do not make the difference your guard and if you are truly honest, be afraid of yourself And that when you call for prayer, these people make Namaz as a game because they don't understand anything else, after all, what else can you call us except that we have been sent to God and what we have and i have been sent the faith before me and it is often a rebuke of you to tell me that i can tell you a far worse sentence in the close sentence of God, which God has cursed and has done a great deal to him
 They have made any of them monkeys and pigs and have the reputation of Satan, these people have gone far worse in the door and away from the path, and when these people come to you, they say that we are i have brought faith even though he brought the Kufr with him and then he came out and took it with him and the Nephqa he was hiding, he knows it well, you will see many of them that sin and crime And rush towards Hramkhori who work these people he surely It is very bad, why do not the people of Allah and the ulema stop them from lying and stalking, which these people do is definitely very bad and the Jews started saying that the hand of God is bound and their hands should be tied and the alimony is given at their behest rather Both of his hands are Kushada, he spends the way he wants, and many of those who have been revealed to you, will increase the number of kufa and sarkashi and we have ourselves They put the foundation of feuds and feuds till daily doom, when these people provoke the fire of fire, God extinguishes it and the rue runs in the land to spread the fate and God does not keep the friends friends and if i believe the book If we used to bring and fear, we would surely go through their sins and give them peace and comfort and if these people go towards Taurait and Gospel and their family
 Persist with were revealed are surely above and also boil down to Paॅvon Some of them come and eat, they are reluctant to do what many of them do is bad
 Reach the order which has been passed on to you from your family and if you have not done this then you have a message Not only did you reach and God will protect you from the peasants, God does not let the infidels of the infidels reach the destination
 Mouret and Gospel and those who have fallen on you from the side of your family, do not keep them alive till that time, you have nothing to do with that and that which has been sent to you from the side of your family, you will find many of them in the coffin and coffin
 And will increase you do not regret the gang of infidels, there is no doubt that whether Muslims or Jews are prohibited for consideration, Khwah Nasrani himself No one else will believe in the doom and will do good things, but neither will there be any fear
 Neither those people would be for the sake of freedom, we had taken a great deal of respect from the Israel made and had also sent a lot of rasul to them, when some Rasul came to them against their will, then these people rejected someone and killed someone
 Poured and understood that there would be no problem
 Those people became blind and deaf
 When these people lost their lives, God accepted the situation and then many of them became blind and deaf
 Whatever these people are doing, Allah sees those who believe that Jesus Christ, the son of Mary, is God, although all of them are Kafir, although Christ himself said that Ai Israel is to worship only the God who is ours and yours
 Cradle because God who has created God's own self has been destroyed and his whereabouts are evil and there is no help for the oppressors who are guilty
 That's in God three that there except Khudaa Ykta become arguably infidel Mabud is not and if these people do not stop what they owe, then those who are disgusted with them will surely have a painful opening, then why do these people not live in God's own garden and ask for forgiveness, though God a very splendid kindness, Mary's son Christ is just a Rasul, and his cousins have passed through many and their mother was also a true prisoner
 They were careful how we make a clear statement with our ehkam, then see if these people are going astray, tell me if you pray for something except God, who is neither a loser nor a judge
 If you listen to me, o Rasool, you should tell me that you should not do this book in your day and do not follow the aspirations of those who have already been misled and Left mislead Huteron and Raahe those of Israel was turned away from lanes The Kafirs were cursed by the words of David and Mary's son Jesus because of the fact that they disobeyed and grew to a great extent and were not deterred by any evil deeds that they did It was so bad that you will see many of them that they are friends with the Kuffar, which they have already fixed for themselves, how bad it is that God is gawking at them and Always be in wonder or agar ye log khuda or rasul par or jo kuch unpar nazil kiya gaya he imaan rakhte hai to haragiz dost na banaate magar unamem ke bahuterey to badchalan hai imaan laane waalon kaa dushman sabase badhake yahudiyon or musharikon ko paaoge or eemaandaaron kaa dosti main sabase badhake qareeb un logon ko paaoge jo apane ko nasara kehete hai kyonki in main se yaqini bahut se aamil or aabid hai or is sabab se ki ye log haragiz shekhi nahin karte And you see that when they listen to the people who have been nourished by our Rasul, there will be a lot of tears being released from their eyes because they have recognized the right that i believe that my parents, i have believed Keep writing to us with the helpers and what has happened to us is that we should not believe in God and the right that has come to us and expect God to be his righteous If you will reach us with God, then God has given them the garden at whose disposal the canals will always remain in them, and this is the duty of those who do righteousness and those who have done good things and our verses
 These people are false people, honest people, do not harm yourself and grow to the limit, because the food that God himself has made for you
 He does not keep friends who grow to great extent, and those who are halal clean things God has given them to you and eat them and be afraid of the God whom you have believed, God will not arrest you on your useless oaths, but the person will surely take your penalty if you take true oath and against him
 You feed your Ahloyal yourself, you have to feed or dress them or free a slave of the ten medals of the same type
 If this is not possible, then it is the penalty of my oath for three days, when you swear and take care of your oaths, God expressly tells your ehkam for you, so that you can trust the believers, Gambling and fetish and lust are just badass things, so you people stay away from it so that you can enjoy the yatra, it is only the desire that because of the evil and the gambling, you should be able to keep your body alive and hurt and keep your memories and prayers alive
 So are you going to halt from it and stay away from the orders of God and the rules of Rasool, and even if you turned your back on it, then understand that there is a clear message on our Rasool
 It is a duty to give those who have confessed faith and done good deeds, that there is no sin in what they have eaten, when they have abstained and brought faith and did good deeds, then they abstained and did righteousness, and those who do good righteousness are friends
 Keeps you, believers who can reach your hands and eyes with a few gifts, God will surely test to see who is afraid of spears
 Then killed then who will transgresses the painful punishment for him The two Munsif men of you who chase him out of the chapayas will be rewarded by sacrificing them to reach the Kaaba, or to eat fine obedience or to keep fast equal to it so that you can enjoy the punishment of your deeds that God has already done
 If you do so, then whoever does such an act will punish him and God is the avenging avenger for you and the convoy
 Food has been justified for you, but the happiness of the dryness is as long as you live in Ihram, you are forbidden, and be afraid of the God whom you will be raised to, the God who is home to the Kaaba and hurts the months and sacrifices more
 The animal who has been put around the neck has given the promise of keeping the peace of the people, because you know that God is in some hope and everything is in the ground
 Hinn knows and that Beshk Knowing God's cognizance of every thing that surely God It is a great wonder and that is a very splendid kindness, nothing but to deliver the message to Rasul and whatever you reveal and everything you do secretly, everyone knows that the evil and the dish are not equal It is possible that if you do not know the goodness of the nefarious exercise, then be afraid of such foolish Allah so that you can succeed, do not ask such things about those who believe that if If you know, then you know bad and if you ask about them at the time of the Quran, then you will be revealed by God, and God is a very big boar, even before you people asked such things
 She was then acquitted, God has not set up any book or wedding, nor did she make any money, but the Goddess of God They lie Bohtan are binding and they do not often and when told that God has given the Nazil to him and found his father's grandfather in Rasool's Aayo, that is enough for us, if our fathers don't know anything or have not been instructed, those who believe should take your news while you are on the way If someone misleads you cannot harm you, you all have to return to God only, then whatever you used to do will tell you, when the believers die on any of you If at the time of the will, it is necessary to witness the testimony of two of you, and when you travel somewhere by chance and you face the trouble of death, then two witnesses are not right if you believe them, then stop them both after prayer
 They both swear by God that we belong to this and we will not hide the testimony of God
 If we do this, then we are dishonest criminals if it is known that both of them are free from crime

 This would have made him the co-officer of the throne of Scotland and would have become the legal king of Scotland if he had died before his wife, the queen
 mairi ne uske is anurodh ko khaarij kar diya or iske baad se unke vaivaahik sambandhon main katutaa aati gai
 Darnley was jealous of Mary's close friendship with her private Catholic secretary David Rizzio, who he also considered the father of Mary's son
 march 1566 tak, darnle mairi ke khilaaf vidroh karne vaale protestant saamanto ke saath ek gupt shadyantra main shaamil ho gaya

 However, there was no doubt at that time as Mary had gone with her security personnel and advisors
 jedburg lautne ke turant baad mairi ko gambhir beemaari ne jakad liya
 She succumbed to frequent vomiting, low visibility, mute and fainting tremors
 unhen maranavastha main samajha jane laga
 But after 25 October, his health improved and the credit was given to his French physicians
 unki beemaari kaa kaaran anjaan tha, phir bhi jaanch ke anusaar unhen aisa maansik dabaav or shaareerik thakaan kii vajah se hua tha
 In November 1566 Mary and other noblemen met at Craigmillar's Fort near Edinburgh to understand and discuss "the problem facing Darnley"

 There were no marks of injury or violence on his body

 By the end of February, Bothwell was believed to be guilty of the murder of Darnley
 darnle ke pita lennox ne bothewel par scotland kii sansad main mukadmaa chalaane kii maang kii jise mairi ne maan liya lekin saboot jutaney ke liye vakt dene se inkaar kar diya
 Bothwell was freed on April 12 after a 7-hour hearing in the absence of Lenox and lack of evidence

 Initially, Mary felt that many of the lords had accepted and supported her marriage with Bothwell, but Bothwell, who had now become the queen's husband, and his position was elevated from the other ministers in the court and Relations with the courtiers began to become bitter
 yah vivaah logon ke bich behad alokapriy ho gaya tha
 Catholics considered marriage illegal because they did not consider Bothwell's divorce and marriage to Protestant customs proper
 protestant or catholic donon ko hi is baat kaa yakeen nahin tha ki mairi apane purv pati ke hatyaropee se shaadi kar lengi
 The marriage brought a storm in Mary's life and she was very disappointed and frustrated

 Mary and Bothwell were confronted by these feudatories at Carberry Hill, but there was no war because many soldiers of Mary's army escaped during the settlement negotiations and their numbers were greatly reduced

20 and 23 July
 14 july ko unhen apane 1 varshiya putr james 6 ke liye rani ke apane pad ko tyaagane ko majaboor kiya gaya
 James 6 became King and More acting ruler
 jabaki james hepabern yani bothewel ko deshnikala diya ja chukaa tha
 He was imprisoned in Denmark where he died of insanity in 1578
 2 may 1568 ko jorz duglas kii madad se mairi lock leven kile ke apane karawas se bhaag gayin

 Mary thought that Elizabeth would help them regain Scotland's power
 lekin elizabeth satark thim, unhone 26 darbariyon dwaara mairi ke khilaaf kiye gayi vidroh or darnle kii maut main mairi kaa haath hone kii kisi bhi sambhaavnaaon ko jaanchane ke liye jaanchdal gathit kiya
 In mid-july 1568, the British authorities moved Mary to the fort of Bolton, very far from the Scottish border
 oktober 1568 or janvari 1569 ke bich pehle york va baad main westminster main ek jaanch dal ne baithken kin
 While in Scotland his supporters continued to wage a civil war against the acting ruler More and his successors
 ek rani hone ke naate mairi ne kisi bhi adaalat main apane upar mukadmaa chalaane kii takat hone se or york main sunwaayee ke dauraan vyaktigat upasthiti darz karaane se inkaar kar diya
 Mary sent her representatives to the court but Elizabeth denied his presence
 mairi ke khilaaf sabooton ke taur par more ne kuch atra dikhaaye jinhen sandook kii chiththiyaan yaa kaha jaataa he
 —these were unsigned chest sheets that were said to have been sent by Mary to Bothwell
 inamen shaadi ke do anubandh patr the, or 14 panktiyon kii ek prem kavita thi jo ek raja francis 2 kii muhar se susajjit ek foot lambey chaandi ke sandook main pai gayin thim
 Mary is ignorant of these letters and says that following her authorship is not a difficult task to write the same and she does not have any signature on the letters so they are false
 in chitthiyon ko behad ahm mana gaya kyonki iname mairi ke darnle ke katl ko lekar aatmaglani kii bhavanaayen varnit thim
 The Duke of Norfolk, the chairman of the investigation team, considered these letters to be very serious and fierce and of many different kinds of loving songs, and sent copies of them to Elizabeth stating that Mary was guilty if they were real
 sandook ke in patron kii pramanikta itihaaskaaron ke bich vivaad kaa vishay rahi he
 Now it is impossible to prove anything about them
 french bhashaa main likhi gai yah chiththiyaan sambhavat: mairi ke putr dwaara 1584 main nasht kar di gayin thim
 Some of the remaining copies which have been translated into English are also not complete
 anya dastavej jinaki jaanch hui unamem bothewel ke gordon ko diye talaak kii pratiyaan thim jinhen more ne dunbar se mangvayi thim
 Authors of biographies of Mary, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, conclude that the letters were either completely fake or that some deliberate passages were added that could become evidence against Mary
 yaa phir in patron ko kisi or shaks ne bothewel ko yaa phir mairi ne kisi or shaks ko likhaa tha
 Guy says that the language of the letter seems to be different from each other and that there are so many grammatical mistakes in sentences and paragraphs written in French that one cannot expect to be educated and knowledgeable in French like Mary
 haalaanki patron main maujuud kuch anubhag or ardhvakya or kuch lekhan sheliyaan mairi kii lekhan style se mail khaati hai
 The letters of the chest were never released before the 1568 conference
 haalaanki scottish darbariyon ne inhen 1567 main hi dekh liya tha
 Mary was forced to abdicate and was jailed for almost a year
 mairi ko jail bhejne or rani pad se vanchit karne kii kaarywai ko sahi tehraane ke liye in chitthiyon ko kabhi saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya
 Historian Jenny Wormald believes that the Scottish not making these letters public and destroying them in 1584 indicates that there was strong evidence against Mary, while Weir thinks that the events indicate that the Scottish feudal who was Mary's They were opposed, they spent so much time making these letters
 haalaanki mairi ke samakaleen kuch aise vyakti bhi hai jinhone in chitthiyon ko dekha tha or wo inaki sachai par yakeen karte hai jaise kii norflock ke duk jisane sunwaayee ke dauraan mairi se shaadi karne kii gupt yojana banaai thi lekin elizabeth ke dwaara iskaa zikr kiye jane par yah kehete hue isse isse inkaar kar diya ki vah aisi mahila ke saath shaadi karne ke bare main nahin sochataa he jiske saath rahane kaa abhi kuch nahin pataa
 Most of the people of the investigation team considered them right after studying the contents of these letters and matching them with the handwriting of Mary
 elizabeth ne apane chahat ke anusaar jaanch khatm karte hue faisla diya ki mairi yaa uske virdohi scottish saamanton ke khilaaf kuch bhi pakke saboot nahin hai or kuch bhi sabit nahin hota
 For political reasons, Elizabeth did not want Mary to be guilty of Darnley's murder nor innocent, and she did not want to go through the judicial process in this regard
 isaliye is jaanch ko sirf ek rajnatik shigupha hi samajha gaya
 Eventually Morey returned to Scotland and Mary was imprisoned
 is tarah se elizabeth scotland main vahaan kii rani se naahi mitrataa or naahi shatruta pradarshit karte hue ek protestant sarkaar banaae rakhane main kaamyaab raheen
 In Fraser's opinion, this was one of the strangest cases in history in which nothing was proved against both the plaintiff and the defendant, but one was allowed to return to Scotland while the other was held captive
 26 janvari 1569 ko mairi ko tutbari kile le jaaya gaya
 And kept under the supervision of George Talbot and his wife
 elizabeth ne angreji sihansan ke liye mairi ke vichaaron vakaaryon ko apane liye khatra mana or isaliye unhe shrevsbari ke mehalon main bandi bana ke rakhaa
 All these forts were off the border of Scotland and away from London
 mairi ko apane nizi sahaayak va sevak rakhane kii anumati thi jinaki sankhya 16 se adhik rahati thi
 His chambers were decorated with new paintings, decorative items and mats
 unke kaksh main unka rajasi kapadaa jisapar fransisi main mere ant main meri shuruyaat he gutha rahata tha bhi hameshaa susajjit rahata tha
 His servants took care of him, changing sheets and clothes daily by washing and making 32 dishes of his choice which he would serve in silver utensils
 unhen kadi nigaraanee main kabhi kabhi baahar bhi nikalne diya jaataa tha
 He spent most of his time in sewing embroidery

 Overall, it can be said that Elizabeth did not put him in jail, gave him all the royal facilities, but took away his freedom and kept him under detention in various forts in trust of his trusted people

 Norfolk continued to make strategies for marrying Mary, angered by which Elizabeth imprisoned her in the London Tower from October 1569 to August 1570
 agle varsh kii shuruyaat main more kii hatya ho gai va saath hi saath catholicon ke netritv main scotland va uttari england main vidroh shuru ho gaya
 This rebellion of Catholics led Elizabeth to think that Mary could become a proverb for them
 angrej senaaon ne scottish grihayuddh main hastkshep karte hue more samarthak vidrohiyon ko ekajute kiya
 Meanwhile, Elizabeth keeps an eye on Mary with the help of her detectives
 1571 main elizabeth ke mantriyon, cesil or valsingham ne ridolphi shadyantra kaa pardaafash kiya jiskaa uddeshy spani sena or norfott ke duk kii madad se elizabeth ko hataakar mairi ko england kii rani banvaanaa tha
 Norfolk was given the death penalty, and the British Parliament proposed legislation repealing Mary's claim to the English throne, which Elizabeth rejected
 mairi ko badnaam karne ke liye landan main sadook kii chitthiyon kaa mudran or vitaran kiya gaya
 Many such incidents continued to keep Mary at the center
 pope gregory 13 ne 1570 ke purvardh main ek yojana banaai jisamen mairi kaa vivaah spain ke raja philip 2 ke nazaayas bhai or ek praant ke rajyapal austria ke don jon se karne kaa prastaav tha jo spani sena kii madad se netherland kii taraf se england par akraman kii aguwai karne vaala tha
 Following the Throckmorton Conspiracy of 1583, Walsingham proposed to enact a Queen's Protection Act which had legal clauses to punish any of the conspirators against Elizabeth, and to prevent any fictitious heir from gaining the throne by taking advantage of Elizabeth's murder
 farvari 1585 main wiliam peri jo ki ek jasoos tha ko elizabeth kii hatya kaa shadyantra rachate hue giraftaar kiya gaya
 Mary was not aware of this, but her representative Thomas Morgan was involved in the case
 isse elizabeth ko laga ki mairi apane vafaadaaron kii madad se unki hatya karne kii sajeesh rach rahi hai
 In April, Mary was closely supervised by Sir Amias Paulette and at Christmas she was transferred to the Cartley Fort
 11 agast 1586 ko babington shadyantra main doshi paae jane par mairi ko giraftaar kar ke tiksial ke sarkari bhawan le jaaya gaya
 In a successful attempt to prove Mary guilty, Welsingham deliberately made arrangements to get Mary's letters out of Chartley's residence
 mairi ko bataaya gaya ki unki chiththiyaan surakshit haathon main hai lekin vaastaviktaa main vailsingham ne unka kuta khoj liya tha or vah unhen padh letaa tha
 It was clear from these letters that Mary had approved Elizabeth's murder plan
 unhen chaar dinon kii yatra par photheringhe kila le jaaya gaya or oktober main unpar rani suraksha kanoon ke tahat 36 nyayadhishon ke saamne, jinamein se ek vailsingham khud tha, deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya
 In her defense, Mary denied these allegations
 unhone apane virodhiyon ko kaha He pointed out to the judges that he was not even allowed to examine the evidence presented against him, he was not given the liberty to plead and as a foreign queen, he should never be tried for treason under the justice system of England

 Despite this, Elizabeth was reluctant to give him the death penalty

 Elizabeth asks Paulet, the last protector of Mary, if he can find a more illegitimate way to reduce her age than to punish Mary, which she refuses, saying that her conscience does not allow her to do so He does not want to leave a black spot in the name of his descendants
 1 farvari 1587 ko elizabeth ne mrityudand ke aadesh par hastakshar kar diye or apane darbari wiliam davisan ke supurd kar diye
 On 3 February, 10 members of the court of England were summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge and immediately decided to emulate the sentence
 photheringhe main 7 farvari 1587 kii shaam ko mairi ko unhen agali subah mrityudand die jane kii soochna de di gai
 He spent the last hours of his life praying, distributing his personal belongings to the people and writing his last wishes and letters addressed to the King of France

 There were 3 stools, one Mary, and the other two for the Earls of Shrewsberry and Kent who were about to sit to watch the punishment
 chabutare par ek takiya tha jisapar mairi ko jhuk kar baithna tha or sir lakdi ke saanche main fansaana tha
 The executioners bowed down to Mary and apologized
 mairi ne jawaab diya main tumhen puure dil se kshamaa karti hoon, main ummid karti hoon ki ab tum mere saare dukhon kaa ant kar doge
 Her servants Jane Kennedy, Elizabeth Curl, and the executioners helped Mary to land royal clothes, jewelry and other royal marks
 mairi ab catholicon ke shahadat ke rang, katthi-gaade bhure rang ke aasteen va makhmali peticot main thim
 Kennedy blindfolded them and a gold shawl mounted on a pillow placed in front of the white blanket
 saanche par apana sir rakhte hue mairi ne apni bhujaayen failaayin or apana antim vaakya kaha ki he bhagwaan! main apni aatma aapke haathon main detii hoon
 Mary's head was not separated from the torso in one stroke and the executioner was able to separate her head in the second blow
 kate hue sir ko uthaate hue chillaaya god seve da queen yani "ishwar rani kii raksha karen"
 At this time Mary's head fell down and the wig was left in the executioner's hand, indicating that Mary's hair was very short and brown in her final years
 kaha jaataa he ki mairi kaa paaltu kutta unke paas hi khada tha or khun main bhigane ke baad usne vahaan se jane se inkaar kar diya va apane maalik ke mrit sharir ke paas hi baitha rahaa
 At the last minute, the jewels, clothing, and other related items worn by Mary, with their blood sprinkled on them, were burnt in the chimney of the Great Hall so that future relics could not be found by memorials to find them
 jab yah soochna elizabeth ke paas pahaunchi to wo behad cruddh ho gayin or kaha ki davidson ne warrant darbariyon ko dikhaakar unke aadesh kii avhelnaa kii he or darbariyon ne bina unki marzi ke yah kaarywai kii he
 However, Elizabeth's uncertainty, back and forth, and ambiguous instructions saved her to some degree from the accusations of Mary's murder
 davisan ko giraftaar kare ke main daal diya gaya
 After Cecil and Welsingham pleaded and were not found guilty, he was freed from prison after 19 months
 france main dafnaae jane ke mairi kii chahat ko elizabeth ne thukraa diya
 His corpse was then placed in a safe glass coffin until he was cremated in July 1587 at Peterborough Cathedral under Protestant customs
 sanlepan prakiya ke tahat nikaali gai uski antadiyon va andruni hisson ko photheringhe mahal main chori chupe dafna diya gaya
 His body was excavated in 1612 at the behest of his son and the new King of England, James I, and was buried respectfully in front of Elizabeth I's tomb in Westminster Abbey

 But all his other descendants, including Elizabeth of Bohemia and Prince Rupert of Aine and the children of Queen Anne, were found in the tomb of Mary's grave
 Assessments of Mary in the sixteenth century divided between Protestant reformers such as George Buchanan and John Knox, who vilified her mercilessly, and Catholic apologists such as Adam Blackwood, who praised, defended and eulogised her
 After the accession of James i in England, historian William Camden wrote an officially sanctioned biography that drew from original documents
 It condemned Buchanan's work as an invention, and "emphasized Mary's evil fortunes rather than her evil character"
 Differing interpretations persisted into the eighteenth century: William Robertson and David Hume argued that the casket letters were genuine and that Mary was guilty of adultery and murder, while William Tytler argued the reverse
 In the later half of the twentieth century, the work of Antonia Fraser was acclaimed as "more objective 


 free from the excesses of adulation or attack" that had characterised older biographies, and her contemporaries Gordon Donaldson and Ian B
 Cowan also produced more balanced works
 Historian Jenny Wormald concluded that Mary was a tragic failure, who was unable to cope with the demands placed on her, but hers was a rare dissenting view in a post-fraser tradition that Mary was a pawn in the hands of scheming noblemen
 There is no concrete proof of her complicity in Darnley's murder or of a conspiracy with Bothwell
 Such accusations rest on assumptions, and Buchanan's biography is today discredited as "almost complete fantasy"
 Mary's courage at her execution helped establish her popular image as the heroic victim in a dramatic tragedy
