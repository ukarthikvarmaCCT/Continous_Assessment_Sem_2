 His imaginations, his knowledge, his eloquence and best of all his generosity and combative consciousness are such that it is believed that Swami Ramanand's personality must have been
 vartmaan jagadguru ramanandaarch pad pratishthit swami ramanareshacharya ji maharaj ke satprayaason kaa nateeja he ki shrimath se kabhi alag ho chuki kabirdasiya, ravidasiya, ramsnehi, prabhruti paramparaayen vaishnav ke sutara main bandhakar shrimath se ekarupata sthapit kar rahi he

 spasht he ki daante uske vyavhaar or rang dhang se santusht na tha or baad main sambhavat: usase ghrinaa bhi karne laga tha
 For the convenience of tooth creations, we can divide it into three parts or periods
 pratham bhaag main ve kritiyaan rakhi ja sakati hai jinamein yauvan kaa utsaah or biatris ke prati uske utkar anuraag kaa dharmik roopantaran drushtigochar hota he
 Its duration can be roughly considered from 1283 to 1290
 is kaal kii sabase mukhya rachana vita nuova he
 The second part begins after the death of Viratris
 iskaa vistaar 1291 se 1313 tak rakhaa ja saktaa he
 During this period, his life was temporarily dominated by despair, sorrow and faith, and his inclination became more and more towards philosophy and science
 vah raajnneetik jhagadon kii katutaa main ek daanv pechon yaa yojanaon main lipt hota gaya
 The main compositions of this period are The Convivio, The Monarchia, The Epicles etc
 samrat henry saptam se daante ne badi badi aashaaq band rakhi thi jinpar uski mrityu ne pani pher diya
 All his plans ended abruptly, but the reward was that he could not defeat him completely
 usne ek baar phir aadhyatmik santulan kii ore kadam badhaayaa
 The ideas and beliefs of youth resurfaced in him and he became even more strongly oriented towards the worship of the Holy Spirit of the late Biatris
 'divine kamedi' kii kitni hi kavitaaon main iske pramaan bikhare pade hai
 This third period of tooth creations can be considered from 1314 to 1321, till the time of his death
 'di vita nuova' ko ham italy ke pratham premakavy kii sangya de sakate hai
 In this, we get a glimpse of the psychological analysis of the said feelings of the poet
 biatris ke pratham darshan ke baad hi kis tarah uske nae jivan kaa aarambh hua, uske hriday main kis tarah kram kram se is nari ke saundarya evam maadhurya kii bhaavana prabalatar haati gai, dhire dhire vah kis tarah uski aashaaon tathaa prem-bhakthi-upasna kaa centre banati gai, usee mrityu par use kitni maansik vednaa or akulata hui or kis prakaar uskaa parthiv prem ant main divya bhakthi ev poojabhaav main parinat hota gaya, isaki manoram jhaanki is kavy main dekhi ja sakati he
 After the death of Biatris, his attention shifted to the idyllic feelings, thoughts and selfishness for a few years, and he began to eat in the midst of disappointments or doubts
 yah ham uski duusari rachana 'conbivon' main dekh sakate hai
 In both these compositions, where and when Biotrice appears to be a statue of a supernatural beauty, and where it looks like a divine shadow from a philosophical or religious point of view, it is unnecessary to discuss it
 itnaa hi kahana alam hoga ki 'vita nuova' saamaanya premgautha na hokar ek ucch satviktaa ev shraddha kii ore kavi kaa maansik unnayan he
 There is no doubt that despite the many contradictions of hope despair, the heart of the tooth seems to be conscious of its recurrence
 vastut: kavy ke antim bhaag se hi abhas milane lagata he ki kavi ke maanas chakshu par us parloukik jagat kii chaaya padani aarambh ho chuki thi jiskaa centrebindu biatris hi thi or jiskaa paripaak uske 'divine kamedi' naamak kavy main hua
 Among the Latina compositions of teeth, 'de Monarchia' is particularly notable
 isamen dikhalaayaa gaya he ki samrajya kii aavashyakt ek tarah se ishvarsamarthit he
 They depict the separate territories of state and church or religious institution and emphasize that the power of the Pope should be confined to religious matters only
 use patrasangrah 'ipicills' main se bhi kai patron main isi aashay ke vichaar prakat kiye gaye hai
 There was a lot of criticism in the opposition in favor of Dante, whose fame was sometimes seen as being smeared
 phir bhi isamen andeh nahin ki vah mahaan kavi tha jisane apane parvarti anek kaviyon tathaa sahityakaron ko vyapak rup se prabhavit kiya
 With the passage of time, many scholars and thinkers have praised him very much, which helps in giving him a very high place among the writers and poets of the world today

81; 85 sohai imamganj, gaya, bihar sthit ek gaanv he
 Hepatitis e virus is a virus
 kalbhairav nimnlikhit se sambandhit ho saktaa he: Via one of the motherboards by the host adapter: hard discs drive ek aankadon ko sahej kar surakshit rakhane vaala yantra he, jo digital jaankaree chumbakeey rup se likh or pard saktaa he
 It consists of rotating disks which are coated with magnetic material
 bijli na hone par bhi data bhandaaran yantra aankadon ko surakshit rakhata he
 Data is read randomly from a data storage device
 iskaa matlab he ki aankadon ke samooh ko bhandaaran yantra main kisi bhi jagah likhakar surakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Meaning there is no need to store data in any particular order
 iskaa avishkaar 1956 main aai0bi0ium0 naamak company main hua tha
 By the 1960s, the data storage device became the most common standby / auxiliary storage device among all common work computers
 aankada bhandaaran yantra main niyamit rup se sudhaar hone laga or aaj sarwar or vyaktigat sanganakon ke jamaane main bhi isane apni jagah sthir rakhi he
 More than 200 industrial units have built data storage devices
 halaanki zyaadaatar data bhandaaran yantra aaj sigate,toshiba or western digital banaate hai
 Data storage equipment revenue worldwide was $ 32 billion in 2013, down 3% from 2012
 data bhandaaran yantra ko uski bhandaaran kshamta or pradarshan ke aadhaar par vishleshit kiya jaataa hai
 Data storage devices have capacity in bytes
 1024 bite ko 1 kilobite kaha jaataa he
 In the same way, 1024 kilobytes is called 1 megabyte
 1024 megabite ko 1 gigabite kehete he or 1024 gigabite ko 1 terabite kaha jaataa he
 The entire storage space of the data storage system is not available to the user as some part is meant to keep the operating system and some part for the file system and some part possibly for internal redundancy fault correction and data recovery
 aankadon ko likhane vaale nok ke patari tak pahunchane ke samay or padhate vaqt vaanchit kshetra ke nok ke neeche tak pahunchane main lagane vaale samay or aankadon ke yantra se avaagaman kii gati ke aadhaar par pradarshan kshamta kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Today's data storage devices are 3
5 inches for computers that can be placed on the table and 2
5 inches for computers that can be placed on a lap
 data bhandaaran yantra mukhya pranali se sata, yuasabi yaa es
e
es jaise maanak vidyut chaalak taron se jude hote hai
 As of 2014, flash memory was the technology to compete as a solid state operator in the field of additional or auxiliary storage
 In the coming times, it is believed that the hard disk will continue its dominance, but where speed and low power consumption are more important, solid state equipment is being used in place of hard disk
 hard discs arthath sakht chakrika sanchaalak ko pehali baar 1956 main ai bi em ke vaastavik samay transction processing computer ke liye data bhandaaran yukti ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha
 It was also developed for general use, mainframes and use on small computers
 yah pehla ai bi ium drive 350 aar mike do refrigerator ke samaan bada tha or yah 5 million 6 bit aksharon ko rakhane kii kshamta rakhata tha
 It saved the data on a stack of 50 disks
 1962 main ibidam model 1311 ne discs drive laayaa jo washing mashin ke aakaar kaa tha or yah ek hataa sakane vaale discs pack par 20 lakh aksharon ko surakshit rakh saktaa tha
 Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, exactly like magnetic tape reels
 iske baad ke discs pack drivs jo ibidam or duusari companiyon ne banaaye the, computers main istemaal hone lage or 1980 ke dashak tak yah 300 megabite kii kshamta tak pahunch gaye
 hdds that cannot be removed from computers are called "fixed disk" drives
 kuch ucch nishpaadan kshamta vaale achdidi banaaye gaye the jisame prati patari ek nok thi jaise ibidam 2305 taaki nok ko ek patari se duusari patari tak le jane main jo samay vyateet hota he, use bachaaya ja sake
 These were called "fixed heads" or "track on heads" disk drives
 yah bahut manhage the or inhe ab banaaya nahin jaataa
 In 1973, IBM launched a new type of HDD called the "winchester" code
 isamen praathmik taur se khaas baat yah thi kii bijli chale jane par discs head puri tarah se plater se alag nahin hota tha
 Rather it stayed in a particular place of the head disc when the disc stopped moving
 phir se shuru hone par discs head vahi se shuruyaat karata tha
 This proved effective in reducing the expenses of the head promoter system
 vincester praudyogiki ke pehle drivs main hathaaye ja sakane vaale golakaar hisse hote the
 It had a disk pack and a write and read nozzle system
 pravartak motor se jude hue chakke main hi rahata tha
 Subsequent "winchester" drives replaced removable disk packs and used non-removable disk planters
 pehle vincester drivs ke plantres 14 inch ke vyas vaale hua karte the
 After a few years, there was a possibility that if the planters are small then perhaps there may be some more benefits
 8 inch vyas ke plantres vaale drivs aaye or inke baad 5 1 / 4 inch vyas ke plantres vaale drivs bhi aaye
 The 5 1 / 4 inch drives were designed to market the personal computers growing rapidly at the time
 1980 ke dashak ke shuruyaat main HDD bahut manhage the, lekin 1980 ke dashak ke ant tak inke bhav itane kam ho gaye ki sabase saste computaron main bhi inako istemaal kiya jane laga
 In the early 1980s, most hdds were sold as a separate subsystem to the personal computer user
 is up pranali ko drive nirmaataa ke naam se nahin balki up pranali nirmaataa ke naam se bechaa jaataa tha jaise corvas systams, tolgrass technologys yaa to phir nirmaataa ke naam se jaise appal profile
 The IBM PC / XT, launched by IBM in 1983, had a 10-megabyte internal HDD, and since then internal hdds have been used regularly in personal computers
 appal macintosh par bahari achdidi lambe samay tak istemaal kiye jate rahe
 Between 1986 and 1998, every Macintosh computer had a SCSI port on the back to connect external hdds
 2011 ke thailand main aaye baadh ne kai data bhandaaran yantra utpaadak sayantron ko nuksaan pahuchaya tha jisase 2012-2013 ke bich data bhandaaran yantra ke keemton main izaafaa hua tha
 Since the invention of hdds, their air density has steadily increased
 data bhandaaran yantra par ferromegnetic padaarth kii ek patali film hoti he jise aakrisht karke data bhandaaran yantra aankanon ko sahejataa he
 The change of direction of the magnetic field in a sequential manner represents the binary data bits
 chumbakeekaran ke badlaav ko jaanch karke data discs / yantra se padhaa jaataa he
 The data is encoded using a code-writing method
 jaise ran length limited kuta lekhan vidhi
 Which present the data according to the change of magnetic direction
 ek achdidi main takala hota hai jo sapaat gol discs ko pakade rahati hai
 Planters are generally made of non-magnetized materials such as aluminum alloy, glass or ceramic
 in plantres ke upar chumbakeey padaarth kii lep kii jaati hai jo data pakade rahati hai
 The layer of this magnetic material has a thickness of 10 to 20 nanometers and a layer of carbon over it for its protection
 yah chumbakeey padaarth kii parat paper ke motaai se bhi kam hoti hai jo kii 7 xxrep 4 0 se 18 xxrep 4 0 nanometer hoti hai
 Today's hard disk planters are rotated at different speeds, ranging from 4200 rotations per minute in portable devices to 15,000 rpm in high performance capacity servers
 pehla achdidi 1200 arpm kii gati se ghuma tha or kai varsh tak saare achdidi 3600 arpm main ghoomte the
 As of December 2013, most consumer-class hdds run at 5400 rpm or 7200 revolutions per minute
 plater jaise hi read - rhite head ke neeche ghumta hai us samay soochna plater par se padhi jaati hai yaa likhi jaati hai
 Reed - Right head and plotter have very short distances of just a few nanometers
 read - rhite head uske neeche ke chumbakeey padaarth ko padhane or badalane kaa kaam karata hai
 Modern hdds have a reed-right head above each magnetized plotter that is attached to a common arm
 ek gati denevaali bhujaa head ko discs ke ghoomte samay ek vrutt-chaap kii disha main hilaati hai taaki harek head plater ke pure sataha tak pahunch sake
 Voice coil actuators or some earlier designs use stepper motors to move this arm
 drive main jo chumbakeey plate lagi hoti he uske upar prakaashiya tapavarodhan kiya jaataa he
 In earlier hard disk drives, static / same bits were written in seconds, so data was on every track
 lekin aadhunik discs drivs main jone bit recording istemaal karte hai isamen likhane kii raftaar andar se baahar ke trek / patari main jate hue badhati rahati hai isse baahar ke patariyon main zyaada data surakshit rakh sakate hai
 Due to the small size of the magnetic field in modern instruments, it is likely that it can lose its magnetic state due to heat
 garmi ke vajah se hui is chumbakeey asthirataa ko "superperamagnetic limit" bhi kaha jaataa hai
 To avoid this situation, planters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, between them there is a non-magnetized layer of 3 molecules thickness
 donon parato main vipareet disha main chumbakeey prabhaav hota hai, is prakaar donon parat ek duusare ko sudrudh karte hai
 Another technique used to deal with the effect of heat is called perpendicular recording
 isse recording dencity bhi zyaada milti hai 2005 main ise pehali baar ship kiya gaya tha aaj kai HDD yah takanic istemaal kar rahi hai
 a simple HDD consists of two electric motors
 ek takali se lagi hui motor jo chakrika ko ghumaati hai or ek pravartak motor jo read / rhite head pranali ko ghoomte hue chakrika ke upar le jaataa hai
 The motor connected to the disc has an external rotor that is connected with the disc, the electrical conductor permanent winding wire] installed in one place
 pravartak ke thik vipareet takale se judy chadi ke ant par ek read -rhite head hoti hai
 This write / read nozzle is connected to a very thin electrical circuit with the amplifier electronics located at the focal point of the actuator
 nok kii sahaayak bhujaa vajan main bahut halaki or thos hoti he
 Its speed can be up to 550 g in modern devices
 pravartak ek sthaayee chumbak hota hai
 It has a rotating coil which drives the write / read tip at the right place
 dhaatu kii ek thali ek squat neodiminum -aayran -boron teevr pravaah vaale chumbak ko thame rakhti he
 Beneath this plate is a rotating metal latch, also called a voiced coil
 yah qoil pravartak ke centre se judaa rahata hai or is qoil ke neeche ek neodiminum -aayran -boron chumbak hota he
 It is mounted on a plate at the very bottom of the motor
 awaz vaali qoil kaa aakaar ek tir ke nok ke jaisaa hota hai or ise 2 baar lep kiye hue tambe ke chumbakeey taar se banaaya jaataa hai
 The inside surface is for heat insulation and the outside surface is hot plastic
 nok ke donon taraf ke qoil chumbakeey kshetra ke saath lagate rahete hai
 When the electric current travels in the direction of one metal flanks and in the outer direction of the other flakes, a tangent pressure is produced which rotates the actuator
 HDD ke electronics pravartak ke harakat ko niyantrit karti hai or discs ke parikraman yaa golakaar chalane ko bhi niyantrit karti hai
 She also works for reading or writing information from the disc according to the instructions of the disk controller
 drive electronics kii pratipushti chakrika ke khaas hisson se hoti hai jo sarvo pratipushti ke liye samarpit hota hai
 These are either fully concentric circles or the parts in which the real data are scattered
 ek data bhandaran yantra yaa sakht chakrika sanchaalak main ek yaa ek se zyaada tej ghoomane vaali chakrikaay or chumbakeey nok hote hai
 They are placed on top of a moving actuator arm so that the data can be written or read on the surface of the disc with the help of this tip
 jitna samay chumbakeey nok ko silinder yaa patari main le jane main lage or uske saath hi jo samay chakrika ke hisse ko nok ke neeche ghoomane main lage or kitna data har kshan main preshit ho rahaa hai in maapdando par hi data bhandaran yantra kaa pradarshan nishchit kiya jaataa hai
 Modern data storage devices use error correction codes a lot, especially the read-solomon error prevention code
 yah takanic atirikt bit sahej kar rakhti hai
 Each data block contains a few extra bits that use some math formulas to correct mistakes invisibly
 yah atirikt bits data bhandaran yantra main kuch jagah zarur le lete hai lekin yah data bhandaran yantra par zyaada lekhan ghanatv hona sambhav banaati hai or jo is prakriya main jo galtiyaan aa jaati hai unhen thik karnaa bhi sambhav banaati hai
 The result is that the storage capacity of the data storage device is high
 udhaaharan swaroop ek 1 tibi kshamta vaala data bhandaran yantra jisame 512 bite khand hai vah 93 jibi atirikt data bhandaaran kshamta paata hai
 Small Density Parity Check codes have been replaced by reed-solomon in a brand new data storage system

 This gives the highest storage density
 menfrem or chote computers ke hard discs alag alag aakaar ke hua karte the
 These were the size of a washing machine or so that they could fit in a 19 inch rack
 ibm ne 1962 main model 1131 discs ko bazaar main utaara
 It used 14-inch discs
 yah kai saalon tak menfrem or chote computer kaa maanak aakaar rahaa
 Such large discs have never been used in microprocessor based systems
 jaise jaise flopy discs drive vaali microprocesar kii bikri badhati gayi apadidi anukulak ke naap kaa ho aise hard discs kii maang bhi bad gayi
 Initially, microcomputer hdds had the same form factories as 8 "inch, 5
25" inch and 3
5 inch fdds
 baad main isse bhi chote achdidi form factors aaye
 9
5 inches × 4
624 inches × 14

 This small form factor in HDD was first introduced by Seagate in 1980
 iskaa aakaar 51 / 4 inch apadidi jitna hi tha
 Its height was 3

 This small form factor was first introduced by Praeritech in 1988
 yah mobile yantro or solid state drivs main hard drive kii tarah istemaal hota hai
 It is also used in playstation 3 and Xbox 360 video game systems
 54 mm x 8mm x 78
5 mm yah form factor sabase pehle 1993 main Integral Pehripherals ne laayaa tha
 For some time it was used extensively in digital audio players and subnotebooks
 lekin baad main isaki lokapriyata bahut kam ho gayi or yah form factor market main rer hota ja rahaa hai
 42
8 mm x 5 mm x 36
4 mm This form factor was introduced in 1999 as an IBM microdrive
 yah isliye banaaya gaya tha taaki yah CF Type 2 slot main feet ho sake
 Samsung in its Product Literature describes its same form factor as 1

85 inch form factor vaale HDD kaa nirmaan bandha kar diya hai kyunki yuasabi_flash_drive kii keemte ghat rahi hai or iname ko ghoomane vaala poorja bhi nahin hota
 The time it takes to access data depends on two reasons
 ghoomane vaale chakra kaa yantrik swabhaav
 Rotation speed of tip
 ek HDD kaa ausat abhigam kaal saare sambhav sik time kaa ausat hota hai matlab saare sambhavit sik time ko jitne baar aankanon ko padhne kii koshish hui hai unase bhaag karne par yah sankhya hamen milti hai
 But in practice we get this number from statisticians
 difregmentation ek paddati hai jise istemaal karke aankanon ko padhne main jo vilamb hota hai use kam se kam kiya ja saktaa hai
 In this, the related data are kept in areas close to each other
 kuch computer prachaalan tantra swachaalit tareeke se hi difregmentation karte hai
 The goal of automatic defragmentation is to reduce delays but the performance of hdds slows down for a while while this method is running
 ghoomane kii gati badhaakar yaa sik time kam karke data acces karne kaa samay sudhara ja saktaa hai
 Throughput can be increased by increasing air density, thereby increasing the data rate and the amount of data below the head, which also reduces the seek time
 ausatan sik time hai and sarwar ke hard drivs ke liye 4 ms kaa hota hai, mobile drivs ke liye 15 ms aam mobile drivs ke liye 12 ms or desktop hard drivs ke liye 9 ms kaa hota hai
 First, the hard disk drive had a peak time of 600 ms, by the mid-1970s, hard drives became available with a peak time of 25 ms
 shruwaat ke kuch desktop drivs main heads ko hilaane ke liye stepper motors kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha or iske vajah se sik time 80-120 ms jitna hua karata tha
 But by the 1980s, it started using voice coil type octation, making it faster, reducing the time to 20 ms
 iske baad sik time dhire dhire kam hota rahaa
 They typically store data from 60 GB to 4 TB and rotate at 5400 to 10,000 rotations per minute

 But later the name aqueduct, bottomway or covered path started to be considered more suitable
 inke nirmaan kii kriya ko surang lagaana nahin, balki saamaanya khudaai or bharaai hi kehete hai
 Initially, the purpose of enlarging the tunnel by widening it is initially called small tunneling
 khaanon main choti surangen gailariyaan, ddeerghaayen yaa praveshikas kehalaati hai
 The path leading from the top to the bottom of the tunnels, if it is vertical, is called the follicle and if it is slant, it is called the slope or slope

 Seeing abundant examples of such tunnels in nature, it is undoubtedly conceivable that humans must have moved in the direction of digging tunnels since time immemorial - first perhaps for habitats and mausoleums, then for the purpose of extracting minerals and finally : Water systems, drains etc
 for other requirements of civilization

 The problem of ventilation is very important in tunnels
 ise drushti se ojhal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Temporary arrangements can be made for the people working at the time of construction, but if the tunnel is for rail or road etc
, then it is necessary to have a permanent arrangement for proper ventilation
 iskaa saralatam upaay to yah he ki puri surang kii chaudaai ke baraabar chaude or 6-6 me lambey khand lagbhag 150-150 me antar se khule chhod die jaaen, jahaan se surya kaa prakaash or khuli hawa bheetar pahunch sake
 But this is not possible in very long and deep tunnels, it is necessary to resort to mechanical means

 If the tunnel is sloping, smoke and gases will move up the slope
 surang main koi ingine teji se chal rahaa ho to uski gati ke saath bhi dhuaan bheetar hi khinchataa chalaa jayega
 Therefore, one has to make ventilators at different places
 bijli ke motaron kii apeksha bhaap ke ingine chalate hon, to sanvathan kii adhik aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The basis of natural ventilation is the difference between the temperature of the air inside the ventilator and the outside air on the surface
 sheet ritu main coopak main hawa upar kii ore padati he or garmi main neeche kii ore utarati he
 In the spring and autumn seasons, the temperature difference inside and outside the follicle is negligible, so ventilation is not possible
 yantric sanvathan kaa siddhant yah he ki yathasambhav surang ke bichobich se kisi coopak dwaara jiske munh par pankhaa laga hota he, gandi hawa nikalati rahe
 This was not possible in the tunnel leading from below the river Mersey, because the top was flooded
 isliye ek sanvati surang upar se banaai gai, jo nadi ke kinaaron par khulti he or bich main mukhya surang se uske nimnatam bhaag main milti he
 To estimate the speed of ventilation, that is, how much air must pass through the tunnel, it is measured to estimate the time it takes the engine to pass through the tunnel and how much coal will burn in that time

 Dental caries, also known as dental caries or perforation, is a disease in which bacterial processes damage the hardening of the tooth
 ye utak kramshah tuutane lagate hai, jisase dant-kshay utpann ho jate hai
 Tooth decay is caused by two bacteria: Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus
 If left untreated, the disease can result in pain, tooth loss, infection, and even death in extreme conditions

 Instead, dental health organizations support preventive and preventive measures such as regular oral hygiene and dietary changes to prevent dental caries
 danta-kshay kaa vargeekaran sthaan, hetuvigyaan, vikaas kii dar or prabhavit sakht utakon ke aadhaar par kiya ja saktaa he
 These classifications can be used to describe a specific case of tooth decay, so that others can be informed of the situation more accurately and at the same time be informed of the severity of tooth decay
 
 saamanytah sthiti ke aadhaar par vargeekaran karne par kshati ke do prakaar hote hai: chikani sataha par milane vaali kshati or gaddhon va daraaron main milane vaali kshati
 chikani sataha par hone vaali kshati kaa sthaan, vikaas or shrenee gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaali kshati se bhinn hota he

 Blake developed a classification system that is widely used and is based on the condition of tooth decay
 mul vargeekaran main danta-kshayon ko paanch samoohon main rakhaa gaya tha, jinhen shabd “shrenee ” tathaa ek roman ank ke dwaara suchit kiya jaataa tha
 Decay in pits and crevices is reported as Category I; The damage on smooth surface is further divided into Category II, Category III, Category IV and Category V
 danta-kshay ke blake ke vargeekaran main ek shrenee VI bhi joda gaya tha or yah bhi chikani sataha par hone vaali kshati kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Pits and cracks are structural marks on the tooth from which enamel turns inward
 daraaron kaa nirmaan khaanchon ke vikaas ke dauraan hota he, lekin us sthaan par sthit dantabalk puri tarah judaa hua nahin hota
 As a result, a deep linear crater is formed on the enamel's surface structure, which provides a place for dental caries to develop and thrive
 daraaren adhikanshtah pasch daanton kii samrodhak sataha or jambhika par sthit agr daanton kii talvya sataha par sthit hoti hai
 The pits are small, needle-shaped holes, found mostly at the ends or transverse sections of the grooves
 vishisht rup se, charvnak daanton kii bahari satahon par kapol gadde paae jate hai
 For all types of pits and crevices, the highly enamel-folded enamel makes it difficult to maintain oral health care on these surfaces, causing dental damage to develop in these areas is more common
 daanton kii samrodhak parat daant kii kul parat kaa 12
5% hoti he, lekin kul danta-kshayon kaa 50% se adhik bhaag inhen par paaya jaataa he
 90% of total dental caries occur in pits and crevices of children's teeth
 gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaale ksharan kii pahchaan kar paanaa kabhi-kabhi kathin ho saktaa he
 As caries increases, enamel decay near the tooth surface begins to progressively increase in depth
 ek baar jab yah kshay dant-utak or dantabalk ke sangyojan-sthal ke dant-utak par pahunchataa he, to yah ksharan tezi se parshvik rup se failata he
 Within dentin, this erosion follows a triangular pattern, which is directed towards the tooth pulp
 ksharan ke is pattern kaa varnan vishisht rup se do tribhuj ke dwaara kiya jaataa he, jinke aadhaar diije par ek duusare se jude hote hai
 This base-to-base pattern is the typical pattern of erosion of a pit and crack, as opposed to erosion on a smooth surface
 chikani sataha par hone vaale ksharan ke teen prakaar hote hai
 Proximal caries, also known as interspersed caries, occur on the smooth surface between the proximal teeth
 mul ksharan daanton kii mul satahon par hota he
 The third type of erosion that occurs on a smooth surface occurs on any other smooth surface of the tooth
 samipsth ksharan kii pahchaan karnaa sarvaadhik kathin hota he
 Often this type of caries cannot be identified humanely by seeing or by a dental investigator
 Proximal caries form gravelly just below the point of contact of two teeth
 iske parinamswaroop, shuruaati charan main hi samipsth ksharan kii pahchaan karne ke liye ek radiograph kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In Blake's classification system, proximal caries on posterior teeth are called category II caries
 agle daanton par hone vaale samipsth ksharan main yadi krintak chor shaamil na ho, to ise shrenee III main rakhaa jaataa he or yadi krintak chor shaamil ho, to ise shrenee IV main rakhte hai
 Original caries, sometimes described as a type of smooth-surfaced caries, are the third most common type of caries and usually occur when the original surfaces have been exposed to gingival subsidence
 
 If the gums are healthy, the development of root caries is unlikely because the bacterial plaque cannot reach the original surfaces
 The parent surfaces are more vulnerable to demineralization process than enamel because enamel begins to demineralize at ph 6
7, which is higher than enamel's delicate ph
 iske baavjood, dantabalk ksharan kii apeksha mul ksharan ke vikaas ko rokna adhik saral he kyonki dantabalk kii tulana main mul main fluoride kaa punauvasoshana adhik hota he
 Compared to intramuscular surfaces, substantive caries are more likely to occur on the lingual surfaces than on the gingival surfaces
 jabadon par sthit charvnak daant mul ksharan ke sabase aam sthaan hai, jiske baad jabadon par sthit agracharvanak, jambhika par sthit agravarti, jambhika par sthiti pashchavarti or jabade par sthit agravarti daant aate hai
 Injuries are also possible on the smooth surfaces of teeth
 chunki ye antahsamipsth kshetron ke alaava chikani sataha ke sabhi kshetron main hoti hai, atah is prakaar ke ksharan kii pahchaan karnaa saral hota he or ye plak tathaa ksharan ke nirmaan ko protsaahit karne vaale bhojan se jude hote hai
 Under Blake's classification, erosion on gums located near anatomical or gingival surfaces is marked as Category V
 shrenee VI pashchasth daanton ke siron or agrastha daanton ke krintak chhoron ke liye arakshit he
 In addition to the two categories described earlier, caries injury can also be described by their position on a specific surface of a tooth
 daant kii jo sataha gaalon yaa hothon se sabase nikat hoti he, un par hone vaale ksharan ko “ananmukh ksharan kaha jaataa he or jeebh kii ore sthit sataha par hone vaala ksharan, jiheey ksharan kehalaata he
 Erosive caries is further called cupola and bracket
 samrodhak ksharan pashchasth daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paaya jaataa he
 Rodent caries is found on the chewing surfaces of the anterior teeth
 ksharanon kaa varnan “madhyam " athwa "duurastha " ke rup main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Moderate caries refers to a location on the teeth that is closest to the midline of the face, which is located on the vertical axis between the eyes down to the nose and the middle rodent's contact
 madhya rekha se dur sthit daanton kii sthiti kaa varnan duurastha ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 In some instances, the damage is also described in some other way, indicating its cause
 “shishu bottle ksharan”, “praarambhik shishav ksharan” athwa “shishu bottle daant ksharan” asthaayee daanton vaale chote bacchon main paaya jane vaala ek pattern he
 It is most likely to affect the teeth located on the anterior part of the jaw, but all teeth can be affected
 is prakaar ke ksharan ko yah naam is tathy ke aadhaar par mila he ki yah ksharan saamanytah shishuon ko unki bottle main rakhe mithe dravon ke saath sone kii anumati dene athwa shishuon din main kai baar mithe drav pilaane ke parinamswaroop hota he
 Another pattern of caries is "highly diffuse caries", which indicates advanced or excessive caries on multiple surfaces of multiple teeth
 atyadhik failanevaala ksharan munh sookhne kii beemaari se grast, munh ke swasthya kaa dhyaan na rakhane vaale, uttejk kaa prayog karne vaale tathaa / yaa chini kaa bahut adhik seven karne vaale vyaktiyon main dekha ja saktaa he
 If excessive diffuse erosion is due to preceding radiation on the head and neck, it can be described as radiation-affected erosion
 ye samasyaayein mul ke swatahvinaash or jab naye daant ug rahe hon, to puure daant kii punarrachana yaa baad main agyaat kaarnon se utpann ho sakati hai
 Dr
 Miller stated in 1887 that "dental caries is a chemical-parasitic process, which consists of two stages - enamel denervation, resulting in complete destruction, and enamel tissue as the primary stage, followed by The residual solution of the softened residue occurs
 " apni is pariklpana main, dow miller ne teen karkon ko aavashyak bhoomikaayen aavantit kin: To inform the progress rate and past history of caries, temporary details can be applied to them

 duusari ore, praarambhik ksharan kaa prayog kisi aise sthaan par hue kshay kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jisane pehle kisi kshay kaa anubhav na kiya ho
 Paused caries describes an injury on a tooth that has previously been demineralized, but which has been re-privatized before a perforation has occurred
 fluoride upachaar kaa prayog karnaa punarkhatikaran main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Depending on the tissue that is affected, it is possible to describe caries as enamel, dentin, or dentinal caries
 apane vikaas ke prarambh main, ksharan dwaara keval dantabalk ko prabhavit kiya janaa sambhav he
 Once the expansion of caries reaches the deep layer of dentin, the term "dentin caries" is used
 chunki cementem daanton kii jadon ko dhankane vaala sakht utak he, atah saamanytah yah kshay dwaara tab tak prabhavit nahin hota, jab tak ki daant kii jaden munh main ujagar na ho rahi hon
 haalanki, “dant-mul ksharan” shabdaawalee kaa prayog daanton kii jadon par hone vaale kshay kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, lekin bahut hi durlabh sthitiyon main hi yah ksharan keval dant-mul ko prabhavit karata he
 The roots have a very thin layer of cementum on top of a large layer of dentin and thus most caries affecting dentin also affect dentin
 yah sambhav he ki ksharan kaa anubhav kar rahe vyakti ko isaki jaankaree na ho
 The earliest sign of a new carious lesion is in the form of a chapped white patches on the tooth surface, indicating that enamel is demineralized in that area
 ise praarambhik kshay kaha jaataa he
 When demineralization of the wound continues, it can turn brown, but eventually it will turn into a coat
 Before the hole is formed, this process is reversible, but once the hole is formed, the damaged tooth structure cannot be regenerated
 Any lesion that appears brown and shiny indicates that dental caries was present at some point, but the demineralization process has stalled and only one scar remains

 When enamel and dentin are destroyed, this perforation becomes symptomatic
 daant ke prabhavit kshetra apana rang badal dete hai or chune par mulaayam mahasoos hote hai
 Once the caries passes through enamel, the tooth ducts, which have a passage leading to the vein of the tooth, are exposed, causing pain in the teeth
 garm, thande yaa mithe bhojan va peya ke sampark main aane par yah dard or adhik bad saktaa he
 Due to tooth decay, problems like bad breath and distorted taste can also occur
 atyadhik viksit sthitiyon main, daant main hua sankraman aas-paas ke narm utakon tak bhi fail saktaa he
 Complications such as cavernous thrombosis and Ludbig's mumps can also pose a life threat

 Dental caries can occur on any surface of the tooth that is exposed to the pore of the mouth, but it cannot occur on the salvaged structure within the bone
 daanton ko prabhavit karne vaali kuch vishisht bimaariyaan va vikrutiyaan hai, jinke kaaran kisi vyakti main ksharan kaa khatra bad saktaa he
 Amelogenesis imperfecta, which occurs between 1 in 718 and one in 14,000 people, is a disease in which enamel is either not fully formed or is insufficiently formed and can fall out of the teeth
 donon hi sthitiyon main, daanton main kshay kaa khatra bad saktaa he kyonki dantabalk daant kii raksha kar paane main sakasham nahin hota
 In most individuals, the primary cause of dental caries is not teeth deformities or diseases
 Ninety-six percent of the tooth enamel is made up of minerals

5 ke ek piech par dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran prarambh ho jaataa he
 There is a higher risk of erosion in dentin and dentin than enamel because they contain less mineral content
 is prakaar, jab daant kii mul satahon kaa saamana masoodon main hone vaale gaddhon yaa masoodon se judi anya bimariyon se hota he, to ksharan jaldi viksit ho sakate hai
 However, even in a healthy oral environment, there is a risk of tooth decay
 daanton kii sanrachana ksharan ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 Where the deep grooves of teeth are more numerous and exaggerated, there is a greater possibility of development of pits and cracks
 saath hi, yadi daanton ke bich ann-kan dabe hue hon, to ksharan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Many types of oral bacteria are found in our mouths, but it is believed that only a few specific species of those bacteria are responsible for tooth decay, including Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli
 lactobacilas acedophilas, actinomices viscosas, nocardia esapeepi
 or stryptococas mutans kaa danta-kshay, visheshtah danta-mul main hone vaale kshay, ke saath nikat sambandh hota he
 Bacteria around the teeth and gums accumulate in a viscous, cream-like substance called plaque, which acts as a bio-covering
 kuch vishisht sthanon par plak kaa ekatra hona anya sthanon kii tulana main aam hota he
 Like the point of contact between teeth, the grooves found on the chewing surfaces of the molars and forearm teeth also provide microscopic occlusion
 masoodon par plak bhi ekatrit ho saktaa he
 Bacteria present in a person's mouth convert glucose, fructose, and most commonly sucrose into acids such as lactic acid, etc
 through a glycolytic process called fermentation
 yadi in amlon ko daant ke sampark main chhod diya jaae, to ve akhanijeekaran kaa kaaran ban sakate hai, jo ki khanijon ke vilyan kii prakriya he
 However this process is kinetic because remineralization can also occur if this acid is neutralized by saliva or mouthwash
 fluoride toothpaste athwa danta varnish punarkhanijeekaran main sahaayak ho sakate hai
 If demineralization continues for a long time, such a large amount of mineral-content may be lost that the remaining soft biomass decomposes, forming a coat or hole
 aisi sharkaraaon dwaara danta ksharan ke vikaas par daale jane vaale prabhaav ko ksharanakarita kehete hai
 Although sugars are a bound glucose and fructose unit, they are actually more corrosive than a mixture of equal amounts of glucose and fructose
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jeevanu glucose va fructose kii up-ikaayiyon ke bich upasthit bandha se urja praapt karte hai
 S
 by converting sucrose into a highly viscous substance called dexran polysaccharide by enzyme dextransucranase
 Mutans stick to the bio-layer positioned on the tooth
 ksharan ke vikaas kii sambhaavna is baat se bhi prabhavit hoti he ki daant kis aavriti par ksharankari vaataavaranon ke sampark main aate hai
 After a meal or snack, bacteria present in the mouth metabolize sugars, resulting in the formation of an acidic by-product that lowers the ph
 samay ke saath-saath, laar kii pratirohak kshamta or daant kii sataha kii vighatit khanij samagri ke kaaran piech punah saamaanya sthiti par laut aata he
 During each contact with the acidic environment, some part of the non-organic material present on the surface of the teeth disintegrates and can remain decomposed for two hours
 chunki, in amleey avadhiyon ke dauraan daanton par ksharan kaa khatra hota he, atah danta ksharan kaa vikaas amleey sampark kii aavriti par atyadhik nirbhar hota he
 If there is sufficient amount of appropriate carbohydrate in the food, then this erosion process can start within a few days of tooth eruption in the mouth
 pramaan is baat kii ore sanket karte hai ki fluoride upachaar is prakriya ko dhimaa kar dete hai
 Proximal caries take an average of four years to pass through the enamel of a permanent tooth

 This development and loss of mineralization on root erosion is 2
5 times faster than erosion on enamel

 For example, this can happen if children consistently consume sugary drinks from baby bottles

 Examples include Sjögren's syndrome, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and sarcoidosis
 antihistamine or avsaadarodhi dawaaen bhi laar ke pravaah ko khandit kar sakati hai
 Catalysts, most notoriously methylemphetamine, also greatly block the flow of saliva
 utprerakon kaa durupyog karne waalon main bure maukhik swasthya kii pravriti paayi jaati he
 Tetrahydrocannabinol, the active chemical substance found in the cannabis plant, also stops the flow of saliva almost completely and this condition is colloquially called "cotton mouth"

 Use of tobacco may increase the risk of building erosion
 dhoomraviheen tambaakoo ke kuch brandon main ucch sharkara maatra hoti he, jisase ksharan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Tobacco use is an important risk factor for teeth-related diseases that push the gums back
 jab masoode kaa daanton se judaav khatm ho jaataa he, to mul sataha munh main adhik darshneey ho jaati he
 If this happens, basic caries is a worrying factor because the dentin that covers the teeth is demineralized by acids more easily than enamel
 vartmaan main, dhumrapaan or shirobandh ksharan ke bich ek anaupchaarik sambandh kaa samarthan karne vaale paryaapt pramaan uplabdh nahin hai, lekin ye pramaan dhumrapaan or mul-sataha ksharan ke bich ek sambandh kii ore avashya sanket karte hai
 Lead exposure in intrauterine and neonates encourages dental caries

 Enamel is a highly mineralized acellular tissue and is damaged by a chemical process initiated by caries bacteria
 jab ye jeevanu sharkara kaa seven karne lagate hai or iskaa prayog apni swayan kii urja ke liye karne lagate hai, tab ve lactic amla utpann karte hai
 The effects of this process include demineralization of the particles present in enamel, which is caused by the passage of time as well as acids and continues until bacteria physically penetrate the dentin
 Enamel rods, which are the basic units of enamel structure, are located perpendicularly from the tooth surface to the dentin
 chunki ksharan ke dwaara dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran saamanytah dantabalk kii chad kii disha main hi hota he, atah dantabalk main gaddhon va chhidron ke bich bhinn-bhinn tribhujaakar pattern tathaa chikani-sataha vaale ksharan viksit hote hai ki daant ke do kshetron main dantabalk kii chhadon kii sthiti bhinn-bhinn hoti he
 When enamel loses its minerals and dental caries begins to develop, many clear areas develop in enamel, which can be seen with a light microscope
 dantabalk kii sabase gahari parat se dantabalk kii sataha tak, jin kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai he, ve hai: parbhasi kshetra, kaala kshetra, ghaav kaa mukhya-bhaag or sataha kshetra 
 The translucent zone is the first visible sign of erosion and occurs when one to two percent loss of minerals occurs
 kaale kshetra main dantabalk kaa thodaa-sa punarkhanijeekaran hota he, jo is baat kaa ek udhaaharan prastut karata he ki danta kshay kaa vikaas vaikalpik parivartanon ke saath kis prakaar ek sakriy prakriya he
 The area of most demineralization and destruction is the main part of the wound itself
 sataha kshetra apekshaakrit khanij-yukt bana rahata he or tab tak upasthit rahata he, jab tak ki daant kii sanrachana ek chhidr main na badal jaae
 Unlike enamel, dentin responds to the progression of dental caries
 daant ke nirmaan ke baad, dantabalk ko utpann karne vaale aminoblast dantabalk kii rachana puri ho jane par nasht ho jate hai or isaliye baad main dantabalk ke nasht ho jane par ve uski punarrachana nahin kar sakate
 duusari ore, puure jivan-kaal ke dauraan odontoblast ke dwaara dant-utak utpaadit hota rahata he, jo goode or dant-utak ke bich sthit hota he
 Since odontoblasts are present, a catalyst, such as corrosion, can initiate a biological reaction
 in suraksha karypranaliyon main shwetapatli va tritiyak dant-utak kaa nirmaan shaamil hota he
 In dentin located from the deepest layer to enamel, the areas affected by corrosion are the area of translocation, area of destruction, and area of bacterial perforation
 parbhasi kshetra kshati kii prakriya kii aage badhati suchi kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or yah vahaan sthit hota he, jahaan praarambhik akhanijeekaran kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Areas of bacterial perforation and destruction are areas of invading bacteria and ultimately disintegration of dentin
 dant-utak kii sanrachana sookshmdarshi dhaaraon, jinhen dant-utak nalikaayen kaha jaataa he, kii ek vyavastha hoti he, jo goode vaale bhaag se bahari dant-mul yaa dantabalk kii seemaa kii ore baahar nikalati hai
 The diameter of dentinal tubules is more near the pulp and the lowest at the placenta of dentin and enamel
 kshati-prakriya puri dant-utak nalikaaon par jari rahati he, jo ki daant main gaharaai tak ksharan ke vikaas ke parinamswaroop utpann tribhujaakar pattern ke liye zimmedaar hoti hai
 The ducts also allow caries to develop rapidly
 isaki pratikriyaswaroop, nalikaaon ke bheetar upasthit drav is jeevanvik sankraman se ladane ke liye hamaare pratirohak tantra se immunoglobulin laata he
 At the same time, the mineralization of nearby tubes also increases
 iskaa parinaam nalikaaon ke nirmaan ke rup main miltaa he, jo ki jeevanvik pragati kii gati ko kam karne kaa ek prayaas he
 Additionally, when bacterial acids demineralize the hydroxyapatite particles, calcium and phosphorus are released, allowing a greater number of particles to penetrate deeper into the dentinal tubules
 ye kan ek avrodh kaa nirmaan karte hai or ksharan ke vistaar ko dhimaa karte hai
 Following these protective responses, dentin is considered to be whitish
 aisa mana jaataa he dant-utak kii nalikaaon ke bheetar upasthit dravon ke kaaran daant ke goode ke bheetar sthit dard abhigrahi sakriy ho jate hai
 Since the white dentin blocks the flow of such fluids, it is possible that the pain that would have warned of the invasion of bacteria may not have occurred before
 iske parinamswaroop, daant kii kisi bhi samvedansheeltaa ke bina danta ksharan ek lambey samay tak pragati karata rah saktaa he, jisase daant kii sanrachana kii bahut adhik haani ho sakati he
 In response to dental caries, more dentin may be produced in the pulp direction
 is nae dant-utak kaa ullekh tritiyak dant-utak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Tertiary dentin is produced to protect the pulp from the advancing bacteria as much as possible
 jab adhik tritiyak dant-utak utpann ho jaataa he, to goode kaa aakaar ghat jaataa he
 This type of dentin is subclassified according to the presence or absence of the original odontoblast
 yadi odontoblast itane adhik samay tak batch jate hai ki ve danta kshay ke prati pratikriya de saken, to is sthiti main utpann dant-utak ko “pratikriyaatmak " dant-utak kehete hai
 If odontoblasts are destroyed, the dentin produced in this condition is called "rectal" dentin
 sudhaarak dant-utak kii sthiti main, nasht ho chuke odontoblast kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye anya utakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is believed that growth factors, especially tgf-beta, initiate the formation of rectal dentin by pulmonary fibroblasts and mesenchymal tissues
 sudhaarak dant-utak ausatan 1
5 μm / pratidin kii dar par viksit kiya jaataa he, lekin ise 3
5 μm / pratidin tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The resulting dentin consists of irregularly shaped dentinal tubules and may not line up with pre-existing dentinal tubules
 This reduces the ability of dental caries to progress within the dentin tubules

 Dental radiographs may show dental caries, especially caries between the teeth, before being visible in any other way
 bade danta ksharan aksar nangi ankhon se dekhe ja sakate hai, lekin chote ghaavon ko pahchaan paanaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Dentists use radiographic as well as visual and tactile inspection to detect erosion of pits and holes
 praarambhik, chhidr-hin ksharan kii pahchaan aksar sandigdh kshetra ke aar-paar hawa pravaahit karke kii jaati he, jo nami ko hataa detii he or akhanijeekrut dantabalk kii prakaashiya visheshtaon ko parivartit kar detii he
 Some dental researchers have warned against using dental investigators to find caries
 jin sthitiyon main daant ke kisi chote bhaag kaa akhanijeekaran prarambh ho gaya ho, lekin abhi tak koi chhidr utpann na hua ho, unamem danta anveshak se padane vaale dabaav ke kaaran chhidr kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 Since the process of damage can be returned by stopping the formation of the hole, it may be possible to prevent corrosion with fluoride and to reprogram the tooth surface
 jab ek chhidr upasthit ho, to daant kii kho chuki sanrachana ko badalane ke liye punarsthapana kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 At times, erosion of pits and holes can be difficult to identify
 dant-utak tak pahunchane ke liye jeevanu dantabalk kaa bhedan kar sakate hai, lekin tab bahari sataha ko punarkhanijeekrut kiya ja saktaa he, visheshtah yadi fluoride upasthit ho
 These caries, sometimes called "hidden caries", can still be seen by X-ray radiographs, but visual examination of the tooth will show that enamel is intact or minimally perforated
 daant kii nasht ho chuki sanrachana puri tarah punarnirmit nahin hoti, haalanki yadi swatchta ko iske ishtatam str par rakhaa jaae, to bahut chote kshatigrast ghaavon kaa punarkhanijeekaran sambhav ho saktaa he
 For small wounds, occasional fluoride is sometimes used to encourage remineralization

 a spoon is a dental device that is carefully used to remove caries, and is sometimes used when caries in the dentin reaches the pulp
 Once the caries is removed, the lost tooth structure needs some kind of dental restoration, to bring the tooth back to its functional and elegant condition

 When caries is very widespread, it is possible that the structure of the tooth does not have enough space to contain the restorative material within the tooth
 atah ek sheersh kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 This restoration appears like a cap and is folded over the remaining top of the tooth
 sheersh aksar swarna, chini-mitti yaa dhaatu main judi chini-mitti se bane hote hai
 In some specific conditions, endodontic treatment may be necessary to restore the tooth
 andodontic upachaar, jise “root kanal " bhi kaha jaataa he, ki anushansa tab kii jaati he, yadi daant main upasthit guda kshati-kaarak jeevanuon ke kaaran yaa chot ke kaaran nasht ho jaae
 root kanal ke dauraan, daant ke kshatigrast bhaag ke saath hi daant ke goode, nason va sanvahani utakon sahit, ko hataa diya jaataa he
 The ducts are cleaned and shaped by tools of endodontic files, then normally filled with rubber-like material, called gutta form
 daant ko bharaa jaataa he or isamen ek sheersh bhi joda ja saktaa he
 The tooth is now dead without the root canal being complete because it is devoid of any living tissue

 a toothbrush can be used to remove plaque on accessible surfaces, but not between the teeth or inside the pits and crevices on chewing surfaces
 If used properly, dental floss can remove plaque from the places at which otherwise proximal caries may develop
 swatchta kii anya sahaayak vidhiyon main antardant brush, water pick or mouthwash shaamil hai
 However oral health is probably more effective in preventing gum diseases than dental caries
 brush or fluoride toothpaste un gaddhon va daraaron tak nahin pahunch sakate, jinamein chabaae jate samay bhojan funs jaataa he

 For dental health, the frequency of sugar intake is more important than the amount of sugar consumed
 chini or anya carbohydrton kii upasthiti main, munh main sthit jeevanu aise amla utpann karte hai, jo dantabalk, dant-utak va dant-mul ko akhanijeekrut kar sakate hai
 The higher the frequency of bringing teeth into such an environment, the greater the likelihood of dental caries occurring
 Therefore, it is recommended to keep the amount of breakfast to a minimum because having breakfast provides a continuous supply of nutrition for the acid-making bacteria present in the mouth
 saath hi, bahut adhik chabaae jane vaale or chipchipe khaadya-padaarth lambey samay tak daanton par chipke rahete hai or parinamswaroop ve kisi bhojan ke ek bhaag ke rup main sabase acchhee tarah khaae jate hai

 The use of dental sealant is a means of prevention
 ek seelint ek patali plastic-numa parat hoti he, jise charvnak daaton kii chabane vaali satahon par lagaaya jaataa he
 This layer prevents food from getting trapped in pits and crevices within the grooves due to the pressure generated when chewing, so that the bacteria residing there are deprived of the carbohydrates they convert to acid demineralization and thus It prevents the formation of caries in pits and crevices, which are the most common form of dental caries
 bacchon ke daanton par seelint ko saamanytah charvnak daanton ke ugane ke kuch hi samay baad lagaaya jaataa he
 Older people can also benefit from dental sealants, but their dental history and the possibility of caries formation are generally considered

 Hearing the news of the birth of Bairam Khan's son, he himself went there and named the child "rahim"
 rahim ke pita bairam khan teraa varshiya akbar ke atali tathaa abhibhavak the
 Bairam Khan was conferred with the title of khan-e-khana
 ve humayun ke sadhu or antarang mitra the
 Rahim's mother was Sultana Begum, a beautiful and quality girl from Jamal Khan, a Mewati Rajput in present-day Haryana province
 jab rahim paanch varsh ke hi the, tab gujarat ke patan nagar main san 1561 main inke pita bairam khan kii hatya kar di gai
 Rahim was raised by Akbar like his son
 shahi khandaan kii paramparanuroop rahim ko 'mirza khan' kaa kitaab diya gaya
 Rahim studied intensively under the supervision of Baba Jambur
 shiksha samaapt hone par akbar ne apni dhai kii beti mahabaano se rahim kaa vivaah kara diya
 After this, Rahim won wars in Gujarat, Kumbhalner, Udaipur etc
 is par akbar ne apane samay kii sarvocch oopaadhi 'miorj' se rahim ko vibhooshit kiya
 In 1584, Akbar honored Rahim with the title of khan-e-khana

 Bairam Khan stayed in Patan, Gujarat, and sat on the shore after boating at Patan's famous Sahasraling Sarovar, an Afghan chieftain Mubarak Khan came to visit and fraudulently killed Bairam Khan
 yah mubarak khan ne apane pita kii mrityu kaa badla lene ke liye kiya
 This incident made Bairam Khan's family an orphan
 in dhokhebaajon ne sirf katl hi nahin kiya, balki kaaphi lutpaat bhi machaaya
 Widow Sultana Begum, along with some of her servants, escaped to Ahmedabad
 akbar ko ghatana ke bare main jaise hi maaloom hua, unhone sultanaa begum ko darbar waapas aane kaa sandesh bhej diya
 After getting the message on the way, Begum entered Akbar's court
 aise samay main akbar ne apane mahanata kaa saboot dete hue inako badi udaartaa se sharan diya or rahim ke liye kaha “ise sab prakaar se prasann rakho
 He must not know that his father, Khan Khana is no more

 Put it in front of our eyesight

 After the abolition of Rahim's education, Emperor Akbar, while following the tradition of his father Humayun, got Rahim married to Mahaban, sister of Mirza Aziz Koka, Bairam Khan's adversary
 is vivaah main bhi akbar ne vahi kiya, jo pehle karata rahaa tha ki vivaah ke sambandhon ke badaulat aapasi tanaav va puraani se puraani katutaa ko samaapt kar diya karata tha
 Because of Rahim's wedding Beram Kha and Mirza's ongoing estrangement is finished
 rahim kaa vivaah lagbhag solah saal kii umr main kar diya gaya tha
 One of the principal posts to Akbar's court was the post of Mir Arj
 yah pad paakar koi bhi vyakti raaton raat amir ho jaataa tha, kyonki yah pad aisa tha, jisase pahunchakar hi janata kii fariyaad samraat tak pahunchati thi or samraat ke dwaara liye gaye faisle bhi isi pad ke jariye janata tak pahunchaae jate the

 The whole court was stunned upon hearing this decision
 is pad par asin hone kaa matlab tha ki vah vyakti janata evam samraat donon main saamaanya rup se vishwasaneey he
 After much effort and blessings, Akbar could get a boy, whom he named Salim, with the blessings of Sheikh Salim Chishti
 shahjada saleem maan-baap or duusare logon ke adhik dulaar ke kaaran shiksha ke prati udasin ho gaya tha
 Akbar got many great people engaged in Salim's education

 Despite the efforts of all the people, Shahzada Salim did not mind studying
 akbar ne sadaa kii tarah apana aakhri hathiyaar rahim khaane khaanaa ko saleem kaa atali niyukt kiya
 It is said that Rahim was very happy to get this glory
 rahim ne avadhi or brajabhasha donon main hi kavita kii he jo saral, swaabhaavik or pravahpurn he

 rasvidya kaa uddeshy is erkanam ko hi praapt karnaa he or yah siikhnaa he ki roganivaranarth is erkanam kaa kaise prayog kiya jaay

 Part of the category of vajrayan ko tantric buddha dharm, tantrayaan, mantryaan, gupt mantra, gudh buddha dharm or vishamkon style yaa vajra rasta bhi kaha jaataa he

 From the Tantric point of view, the light of knowledge comes from the experience that the two theories that seem opposite are actually one; Along with passive concepts of emptiness and wisdom, active compassion and measures should also be conceptualized
 is mul dhruvata or iske sankalp ko akasar kaam-vaasana ke pratikon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 The historical origins of Vajrayana are not clear, only it shows that it developed with the expansion of the intellectual ideology of Buddhism
