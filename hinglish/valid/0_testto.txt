 chaplin kii pehali filmi upasthiti ke baad, mekking a living film banaai gai, senet ko laga kii unhone ek badi mahangi galati kii thi
 Most believe Normand had persuaded him to give Chaplin another chance
 normand ko chaplin saunpe gaye the, jinhone unki kuch pehali filmon ko nirdeshit kiya or likhaa tha
 Chaplin did not like being directed by a woman and the two often disagreed
 ant main donon ne apane matbhedon ko dur kiya or chaplin ke keestone chhodane ke baad bhi lambey samay tak dost bane rahe
 Mac Sennett was not at all angry with Chaplin, and Chaplin believed that Sennett would have fired him after a disagreement with Normand
 However, Chaplin's films soon became successful and he became one of Keystone's biggest stars
 chaplin kii pehali filmein mike senet ke keestone studio ke liye banaai gai thi, jahaan unhone apane bahetu charitra ko viksit kiya or bahut jaldi film banane kii kaushal or kala sikhi

 However, she made her own dress for a film, Mabels Strange Prediction, which was to be released a few days ago but was released later
 Mack Sennett requested that Chaplin "be in a comedy makeup"
 As Chaplin recalled in his autobiography
 "mujhe pataa nahin tha ki kaisaa mechap karnaa he
 i did not like my character as a press reporter
 lekin almaari kii ore jate hue maine sochaa ki main baigi pant, bade juute, ek chadi or ek darbi topi pahanoonga
main sab kuch virodhabhas chahta tha: pant baigi, kot tang, topi choti or juute bade
 main duvidha main tha ki bada dikhuun yaa chota, lekin senet ko yaad kiya to vah chahta tha kii main ek vruddh aadmi laguun, maine ek choti much lagaai, jo mujhe laga ki mujhe bada dikhaaegi, meri abhivyakti chhupaae bina
mujhe bhoomika kaa pataa nahin tha
 But when i was ready, i felt that person in those clothes and makeup
 main use jaanane laga or jab tak main stage main pahunchaa tab tak vah janm le chukaa tha
 Fatty Arbakkal contributed his father-in-law's derby and his pant
 Chester Conklin gave short cutaway tailcoat and Ford Sterling 14 no
 Provided the shoes, which were so large, that Chaplin had to wear them on the wrong feet to walk
 He made a mustache out of Mc Sven's crepe hair

 Chaplin's many roles immediately began to gain enormous popularity among cinema audiences
 chaplin kii shuruaati keestone main mike senet kii atyadhik shaareerik kamedi or atishyoktipurna ishaaron ke maanak kaa upyog kiya gaya tha
 Chaplin's pantomime was subtle and could be suitable for romantic and homely imitations, replacing the usual keystone shooting and crowd scenes
 drishy pratibandh shuddh keestone the, lekin; bahetu bhoomika main laaton or eenton ke saath apane dushman par aakraamak hamalaa karnaa tha
 Film audiences liked the new cheerful comedian, though critics warned that his actions were at the limit of obscenity
 chaplin ko jaldi hi apni filmon kaa nirdesan or sampadan kaary saunpa gaya tha
 In his first year in films, he made 34 shorts for Sennett, as well as the historical comedy feature "tillis Punctured Romance"
 chaplin kii mukhya bhunika "da trenp" kii thi 
 parishkrut shishtachar, kapadey or ek sajjan ke sammaan ke saath "da trenp" ek aawaara he
 This character wears a tight coat, large trousers and shoes, and a derby; a bamboo stick; And has a unique toothbrush mustache

 In 1915, Chaplin signed a more favorable contract with Essene Studios and further developed his cinematic prowess, adding a new level of depth and compassion to the Keystone style spectacle
 Most Essene films were more ambitious, twice the average Keystone comic
 Used to go chaplin ne apni bhi share company banaai, jisamen bholi edana parviens or hasya khalanaayak liyo white or bed jamison shaamil the
 In 1916, the Mutual Film Corporation paid Chaplin US $ 670,000 to produce two dozen reel comedies
 unhen puraa kalatmak niyantran diya gaya tha or atharah maheenon main baarah filmon kaa nirmaan kiya, jinhen cinema main sabase prabhaavshaalee kamedi filmon kii shrenee mili
 Practically every mutual comedy is an excellent one: Easy Street, One Aim, The Poonshop and The Adventure are best known

 Chaplin considered the Mutual Period the happiest period of his career, although he had other concerns that the films were formulaic during that time, due to the stringent production schedules that his contract required
 vishwa yudgh main america ke pravesh ke baad, chaplin apane kareebi dost duglas ferebanks or meri picleford ke saath ek swatantraaa bands ke pravaktaa ban gaye
 Most of Chaplin's films were distributed in the Keystone, Essene, and Mutual periods
 After Chaplin took control of his productions in 1918, industrialists met his demand by bringing back Chaplin's old humor
 filmon ko phir se gadha gaya, punah sheershak gadha gaya or baar-baar pun: prachlit kiya gaya, pehle cinemagharon ke liye, phir grih film bazaar or haal ke varshon main, grih video ke liye
 Essene was also guilty of this practice, creating 'new' Chaplin humor from old film clips and rejected performances
 1933 main baarah mutual hasya ko dhwani film ke rup main nayaa banaaya gaya, jab nirmaataa amadi je

 Attempts to make definitive versions of Chaplin's pre-1918 short films have begun in recent years; All twelve mutual films were reinstated in 1975 by archivist David Sheppard and the Blackhawk films, and in 2006 new restorations were released on DVD with more footage
 chaplin ne kabhi bhi prasanketak se zyada apni film nirmaan vidhiyon ke bare main baat nahin kii, yah daawa karte hue ki aisa karnaa ek jaadugar ke bhram ko todane ke samaan hoga
 In fact, Chaplin had never worked in the finished script until he started making the film The Great Dictator in 1940
 unhone yah vidhi tab viksit kii thi jab unke assane anubandh ne unhen apni filmein likhane or nirdeshit karne kaa mauka diya, jo ek aspasht parisar se shuru karnaa tha - udhaaharan ke liye "charlie ek swasthya spa main pravisht hue" yaa "charlie ek sahuukaar kii dukaan main kaam karte hai
 "chaplin then produced the sets and worked with his share company to improve the jokes and" business "around them, almost always considering the film
 jaise vichaaron ko sweekaar kar or tyaag kar, ek katha kii sanrachana ubhartee thi, to aksar chaplin ko pehle se hi puure ank ko waapas shoot karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi, jo kii anyathaa kahani kaa khandan karti

 This is one of the reasons that Chaplin took longer to complete his films than his rivals
 iske alaava, chaplin ek avishwasaneey rup se maang karanevaale nirdeshak the, jaisaa pradarshan vah chaahate the bilkul vaisaa apane abhinaytaon ko dikhaate the or anginat shot lete the, jab tak unhen vaisaa shot naa mili jaisaa vah chaahate the
 Was funded and distributed by First National but otherwise gave him full creative control over what he could do at a slow pace, allowing him to focus on quality
 Chaplin built his Hollywood studio and exercised his freedom , Eternal work that will remain entertaining and impressive
 Although First National expected Chaplin to make short comedies such as: Rakhyat Mutuals, Chaplin, with ambition expanded most of his personal projects into long feature-films, including Shoulder Arms, The Pilgrim and the feature-length classic, The Kid

haalanki, kai darshak ise abhi bhi ek mook film-or ek yug kaa ant maanate hai
 However, after becoming prevalent in 1927, "eloquent" immediately became a major method of film making, but during the 1930s Chaplin opposed making such a film
 vah cinema ko multah ek mook naatak kala maanate the
 He said: "anger is generally understood more easily than words

 Chaplin's successful move to Limelight won an Academy Award in 1972; Delays in the film's debut in Los Angeles made it desirable after decades of filming

 In the political climate of the time, the film was seen as an act of courage, both for the depiction of Nazism and its depiction of Jewish characters, and for their persecution

 But his films of the 1930s were openly political

 The final dramatic speech in The Great Dictator, which was without question important to patriotic nationalism, and his outspoken public support for opening a second European border to aid the Soviet Union in World War II in 1942, were controversial
 un bhaashanon main se kam se kam ek main, dainik kaaryakarta main ek samakaleen vivaran ke anusaar, unhone suchit kiya tha ki dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad samyawad duniya main fail jayega or ise maanav pragati ke baraabar bataaya gaya tha

 As a result, Chaplin's last American film, Limelight was less political and more autobiographical

 This never happened, perhaps because of fear of Chaplin's ability to satirize investigators
 1952 main chaplin ne US chhod diya, jise united kingdom main landan ke liye limlite ke premier ke liye ek sankshipt yatra ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha

 He believed that if the polity interfered with the economic decisions and interests of the people, then the people would not be able to produce the quantity and quality of goods as they wished, consequently welfare would not be maximized

 In the economies of all countries in the modern period, the principles of voluntary trade in economic planning must be partial

 The city of Pisa, modern Italy, had historically blamed the birth of the great scientist Galileo Galilei on 15 February 1564 as a flaw in the creation of God
 galileo ke dwaara pratipaadit sindvanto se dharmik manyataon kaa khandan hota tha jiske liye galileo ko ishwariya manyataon se chhedchhad karne ke liye sari umr karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 His father Vincenzo Galilei was a well-known music expert of the time
 ve "lut" naamak vaadya yantra bajaate the, yahi lut naamak yantra baad main guitar or benzo ke rup main viksit hua
 During his musical composition, Vincenzo Galilei intimately studied the tension of the stringed string or the string and the tones emanating from it, and found that there is a connection between the tension of the string and the string
 pita ke dwaara sangeet ke liye tani huyi dori yaa taar se nikalne vaali dhvaniyon ke antarasambandhon ke parinaamon kaa vaigyanik adhyayan unke putr galileo dwaara kiya gaya
 During the course of this study, the child Galileo was inspired to assimilate his results by doing a thorough experiment in his mind

 He gave the oscillation formula
 inhone doorabeen kaa avishkaar kiya
 He made the visionary device more advanced

 He is considered the father of modern experimental astronomy
 unhone paaya ki prakruti ke niyam ek duusare karkon se prabhavit hote hai or kisi ek ke badhane or ghatane ke bich ganit ke samikarnon jaise hi sambandh hote he
 That is why he said: - 'the language of God is mathematics
 ‘is mahaan ganitagya or vaigyanik ne hi prakaash kii gati ko naapane kaa saahas kiya
 For this, Galileo and one of his assistants sat on two mountain peaks located several miles away in the dark night
 jahaan se galileo ne laalaten jalaakar rakhi, apane sahaayak kaa sanket paane ke baad unhen laalaten or uske khatke ke madhyam se prakaash kaa sanket dena tha
 His assistant on the second hill had to see the light of the lantern and remove the sign of the second lantern kept near him
 is prakaar duusari pahaad kii chotii par chamakate prakaash ko dekhakar galileo ko prakaash kii gati kaa akalan karnaa tha
 Thus, the results that Galileo achieved were not real to a large extent, but the frequency and success of the experiments, the failure to achieve the desired results only after the failure was unique

 Till that time, it was universally accepted that the Earth is located in the center of the universe and all the celestial bodies including the sun and the moon revolve around the earth continuously
 is manyata ko tadsamay ke dharmacharyon kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Due to the results obtained on the basis of his experiments, Galileo decided to stand against the old concepts
 jab galileo ne yah sidwant saarvajanik kiya to carch ne ise apni avagya mana or is avagya ke liye galileo ko carch kii ore se karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 The idea given by Galileo forced the new man to accept a new form of direction of contemplation
 saamaajik or dharmik pratadna ke chalate purv se vyaapt manyataon or vishwaason ke vipareet pratipaadit sindvanto ke saath ve adhik din tak khadey nahin rah sake
 In 1633, 69-year-old Old Galileo was ordered by the Church to publicly apologize, saying that his doctrine against religious beliefs was the biggest mistake of his life for which he is ashamed
 unhone aisa hi kiya parantu iske baad bhi unhen karawas main daal diya gaya
 His health continued to deteriorate and due to this, the sentence of imprisonment was changed to house-imprisonment i
e
 imprisonment in his own house
 apane jivan kaa aakhri din bhi unhone isi kaid main hi bitaayaa
 The supreme institution of Christianity, always under the supervision of the Pope, in Vatican City, admitted in 1992 that he had made a mistake in deciding Galileo's case
 is prakaar ek mahaan khagol vigyaani, ganitagya, bhautikavid evam darshanik galileo ke sambandh main 1633 main jari aadesh kar apni aitihaasik bhul sweekaar karne main carch ko saade teen sau saalon se bhi adhik kaa samay laga
 Four hundred years after the creation of binoculars and the observation of celestial bodies in the year 1609, the year 400 was celebrated as the International Year of Astronomy as the 400th birth anniversary and paid tribute to this great scientist and tried to make a mistake
 saptarshi taramandal prithvi ke uttari golardh ke akaash main raatri main dikhne vaala ek taramandal he
 It can be seen as a group of seven stars in the sky from the month of phalgun-chaitra to the month of shravan-bhadra

 Naxalism is the informal name of the movement of communist revolutionaries that arose as a result of the Indian communist movement
 naksal shabd kii utpatti pashchim bengal ke chote se gaanv naksalbadi se hui he jahaan bhartiya communist party ke netaa charu majumdaar or kanu sanyaal ne 1967 me satta ke khilaaf ek sashastr andolan kii shuruyaat kii
 Majumdar was one of the biggest admirers of Chinese communist leader Mao Tse Tung and believed that government policies were responsible for the plight of Indian workers and peasants, leading to the establishment of upper-class governance mechanisms and consequently dominance of agriculture
 is nyaayaheen damankaaree varchasv ko keval sashastr kranti se hi samaapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In 1967 the "naxalites" formed an All India Coordination Committee of Communist revolutionaries
 in vidrohiyon ne aupchaarik taur par swayan ko bhartiya communist party se alag kar liya or sarkaar ke khilaaf bhumigat hokar sashastr ladaai ched di
 After the 1971 internal rebellion and the death of Majumdar, the movement split into multiple branches and was distracted from its goal and ideology
 aaj kai naksali sanghathan vaidhanik rup se sweekrut raajnneetik party ban gayi hai or sansadeey chunaavon main bhaag bhi lete he
 But many organizations are still engaged in proxy fighting
 naksalwad ke vichaardhaaratmak vichlan kii sabase badi maar andhra pradesh, chhattisgarh, urisa, jharkhand or bihar ko jhelni pad rahi he
 The term Naxalism originated from the village of Naxalwadi in West Bengal
 bhartiya communist party ke netaa chaaru majumdaar or kanu sanyaal ne 1969 main satta ke khilaaf ek sashastr andolan shuru kiya
 Majumdar was a great fan of China's communist leader Mao Zedong
 isi kaaran naksalwad ko 'maowad' bhi kaha jaataa he
 In 1968, the Communist Party of Marxism and Leninism was formed, headed by Dipendra Bhattacharya
 yah log marks or lenin ke siddhanton par kaam karne lage, kyonki ve unheen se hi prabhavit the
 In 1969, for the first time, Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal started a widespread fight against power in the entire country over land acquisition
 bhoomi adhigrahan ko lekar desh main sabase pehle aawaaj naksalwari se hi uthi thi
 The agitating leaders believed that 'the land is the one who cultivates it'
 naksalwari se shuru hua is andolan kaa prabhaav pehali baar tab dekha gaya jab pashchim bengal se congress ko satta se baahar hona padaa
 The effect of this movement was that for the first time in 1977, Communist Party came to West Bengal and Jyoti Basu became the Chief Minister
 saamaajik jagriti ke liye shuru hue is andolan par kuch saalon ke baad raajnneeti kaa varchasv badhane laga or andolan jald hi apane muddon or raaston se bhatak gaya
 When this movement reached the expanding Bihar, it had completely deviated from its issues
 ab yah ladaai jameenon kii ladaai na rahakar jaateey varg kii ladaai shuru ho chuki thi
 The fierce struggle between the upper class and the middle class begins from here, due to which the Naxal movement took a new form in the country
 shriram sena jo maovadiyon kii sabase badi sena thi, usne ucch varg ke khilaaf sabase pehle hinsak pradarshan karnaa shuru kiya
 Earlier in 1972, Charu Majumdar was arrested due to violent agitation and he died in prison while imprisoned for 10 days
 naksalwadi andolan ke praneta kanu sanyaal ne andolan ke raajnneeti kaa shikaar hone ke kaaran or apane muddon se bhatakane ke kaaran tang aakar 23 march, 1972 ko aatmahatya kar lee

 aapas main sambandhit bhashaaon ko bhashaa-parivaar kehete hai
 There are scientific grounds for which languages belong to which family
 is samay sansar kii bhashaaon kii teen avasthaaen hai
 The ancient languages of various countries, which have not been studied and categorized for lack of sufficient material, are in the first stage
 inkaa astitv inamen uplabdh pracheen shilalekho, sikkon or hastlikhit pustakon main abhi surakshit he
 Similar languages are Sumerian, the old language of Mesopotamia and Etruscan, the ancient language of Italy
 duusari avasthaa main aisi aadhunik bhashaayen hai, jinka samyak shodh ke abhaav main adhyayan or vibhaajan prachur saamagree ke hote hue bhi nahin ho sakaa he
 Basque, Bushman, Japanese, Korean, Andamanese etc
 languages are in this stage
 teesri avasthaa kii bhashaaon main paryaapt saamagree he or unka adhyayan evam vargeekaran ho chukaa he
 Many developed and prosperous languages like Greek, Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, English etc
 are under it
 bhashaa kaa sambandh vyakti, samaaj or desh se hota he
 Therefore each language has its own special feature
 inke aadhaar par vah ek ore kuch bhashaaon se samanta sthapit karti he or duusari ore bahut-si bhashaaon se asamanta
 Mainly there are two types of this characteristic equilibrium-morphological and semantic
 pratham ke antargat shabdon kii akruti arthath shabdon or vaakyon kii rachanastyli kii samanta dekhi jaati he
 In the second there is a similarity of meaning
 inke anusaar bhashaaon ke vargeekaran kii do paddatiyaan hoti hai–akritimulak or paariwarik yaa aitihaasik
 This discussion is related to historical classification, so its bases should be known in some detail
 isamen akritimulak samanta ke atirikt nimnilikhit samantaayein bhi honi chahie
 Geographically, there is often a similarity in proximate languages and inequality in remote languages
 is aadhaar par sansar kii bhashaayen africa, uresia, prashantmahasaagar or america ke khadon main vibhajit kii gayi hai
 However, this basis is not scientific to much extent
 kyonki do samipsth bhashaayen ek-duusare se bhinn ho sakati hai or do duurastha bhashaayen paraspar samaan
 Hindi and Malayalam are two different family languages of India but Sanskrit and English are languages of the same family in remote countries like India and England
 samaan shabdon kaa prachlan jin bhashaaon main rahata he unhen ek kul ke antargat rakhaa jaataa he
 This similarity is based on the proximity of linguists and is possible in two ways
 ek hi samaaj, jati athwa parivaar ke vyaktiyon dwaara shabdon ke samaan rup se vyavahrut hote rahane se samanta aa jaati he
 Apart from this, when people of different countries or castes come into contact with each other for political or commercial development after the development of civilization and means, equality is established between them by exchange of words
 paariwarik vargeekaran ke liye pratham prakaar kii anurupata hi kaam kii hoti he
 Because such words are the original words of the language
 inamen bhi nityprati ke kautumbik jivan main prayukt honevaale sangya, sarvnaam aadi shabd hi adhik upyogi hote hai
 The biggest difficulty in this premise is that with the development of words from other languages, the original words get mixed up in such a way that it becomes difficult to identify and separate them
 is kathinaayee kaa samaadhaan ek seemaa tak arthgat samanta he
 Because many words in the languages of a family are similar in meaning and such words relate them to a family
 isliye arthparak samanta bhi ek mahatvapurn aadhaar he
 Each language has its own theory of sound and pronunciation
 yahi kaaran he ki vah anya bhashaaon kii dhvaniyon se jaldi prabhavit nahin hoti hai or jahaan tak ho saktaa he unhen dhvaninium ke anusaar apni nearesth dhvaniyon se badal leti he
 For example, the A, B, f etc
 sounds of Persian are converted to nearby A, B, f etc
 in Hindi
 atah dhvanisamya kaa aadhaar shabdaawalee-samta se adhik vishwasaneey he
 By the way, sometimes the sounds of one language also develop together in the sounds group of one language and confuse the comparative conclusions
 arya bhashaaon main vaidic kaal se pehle murdhanya dhvaniyaan nahin thi, kintu dravid bhashaa ke prabhaav se aage chalakar viksit ho gayin
 The grammatical basis is most authentic
 kyonki bhashaa kaa anushaasan karne ke kaaran yah jaldi badalata nahin he
 Under the similarity of grammar, word-formation by applying suffix to metal, metal, grammatical process, it is necessary to determine the similarity of terms and structure of terms, etc
 in words
 in chaar aadhaaron par bhashaaon kii adhikadhik samanta nishchit karte unka vargeekaran kiya jaataa he
 In this regard, it should be clearly understood that this equilibrium is relative
 jahaan ek ore bhaaropee parivaar kii bhashaayen anya parivaar kii bhashaaon se bhinn or aapas main samaan hai vahaan duusari ore sanskrit, farsi, greek aadi bhaaropee bhashaayen ek-duusare se inhen aadhaaron par bhinn bhi hai
 At the time of classification, entire languages are divided into Eurasia, Pacific, Sea, Africa and America segments or cycles based on geographical proximity
 phir aapasi samanta rakhanevaali bhashaaon ko ek kul yaa parivaar main rakhkar vibhinn parivaar banaaye jate hai
 a comparison of Avesta, Persian, Sanskrit, Greek etc
 showed that there is a lot of similarity in their vocabulary, sound group and composition
 atah bharat or europe ke is tarah kii bhashaaon kaa ek bhartiya kul bana diya gaya he
 Families are divided into classes
 bhaaropee parivaar main shatam or kentum aise hi varg hai
 Classes are divided into branches
 shatam varg kii ‘irani’ or ‘bhartiya arya’ pramukh shakhaayen hai
 Branches have been divided into sub branches
 grearsan ne aadhunik bhartiya arya bhashaaon ko bhitari or bahari upashakha main vibhakt kiya he
 Hence, subdivisions are divided into language communities and community languages
 is tarah bhashaa paariwarik-vargeekaran kii ikai he
 At this time, the study of the languages of the European family has been done so much that the whole process is applied to it
 in naamon main thodi her-pher ho saktaa he, kintu is prakriya kii avasthaaon main praayah koi antar nahin hota
 It was only in the nineteenth century that the attention of scholars drew attention to the classification of the languages of the world, and to date, many scholars have presented their different classifications from time to time; However, no scientific and authentic classification has yet been presented
 is samasya ko lekar bhashavidon main bada matbhed he
 This is the reason that on the one hand, where the Friedrich Müllers consider the number of these families to be 100, on the other hand, Rice keeps all the languages of the world in only one family
 kintu adhikansh vidvan inaki sankhya baarah yaa teraa maanate hai
 Around seven thousand languages spoken around the world are divided into at least ten families, of which the main families are mentioned below: mukhya lekh hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar This group is the largest family of languages and also the most important because English, Russian, Ancient Persian, Hindi, Punjabi, German - all these languages belong to this group
 ise 'bhaaropee bhashaa-parivaar' bhi kehete hai
 About half of the world's population speaks indo-european language
 sanskrit, greek or laathini jaisi shastreey bhashaaon kaa sambandh bhi isi samooh se he
 But Arabic belongs to a completely different family
 is parivaar kii pracheen bhashaayen bahirmukhi shlisht-yogtmak thim
 This group was also called arya-parivar earlier
 vishwa main jansankhya ke anusaar sabase badi bhashaa mandarin isi parivaar se sambandh rakhti he
 Apart from many languages spoken in China and Tibet, Burmese language also belongs to this family
 inaki swaralahari ek hi he
 If the same word is spoken in high or low vowel, the meaning of the word changes
 shri rajendra singh ne bharat ke sandarbh main is bhashaa parivaar ko 'naag bhashaa parivaar' naam diya he
 It is also called 'monosyllabic family'
 kaaran ki iske mul shabd praaia: ekakshar hote hai
 These languages are spoken in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Nepal, Sikkim, West Bengal, Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura and Mizoram
 isaki pramukh bhashaaon main arami, aseri, sumeri, akkadi or kanani vagairah shaamil thim lekin aajkal is samooh kii prasiddhtam bhashaayen arabi or ibrani hai
 These languages mainly consist of three metal-letters and by making vowels in between, they form verbs and nouns
 bhashaaon kaa dravidi parivaar is lihaaz se bada dilachasp he ki haalaanki ye bhashaayen bharat ke dakshini pradeshon main boli jaati hai lekin unka uttari kshetra main boli jane vaali bhashaaon se koi sambandh nahin he 
 Therefore, Urdu or Hindi can be related to English or German language, but not to Malayalam language
 dakshini bharat or srilanka main dravidi samooh kii koi 26 bhashaayen boli jaati hai lekin unamem zyaada mashhoor tamil, telegu, malayalam or kannada hai
 These are inter-vulgar-yogic languages
 pramukh bhashaaon ke aadhaar par iske anya naam – ‘toorani’, ‘sidian’, ‘phoni-tatarik’ or ‘turk-mongol-manchu’ kul bhi hai
 Its area is very wide, but mainly in Siberia, Manchuria and Mongolia
 pramukh bhashaayen–turki yaa tathari, kirgiz, mongoli or manchu he, jiname sarv pramukh turki he
 The literary language is Osmanali
 turki par arabi or farsi kaa bahut adhik prabhaav tha kintu aajkal iskaa shabdasmooh bahut kuch apana he
 The Ural and Altai languages of this family differ significantly from each other in terms of sound and vocabulary
 isliye kuch vidvan inhen do pruthak kulon main rakhane ke paksh main bhi hai, kintu vyakaranik samya par nissandeh ve ek hi kul kii bhashaayen thaharti hai
 The rules of word formation with the addition of suffixes, immutability of metals, the form and form of the suffixes are the main features of the languages of a family
 swaranurupata se abhipraay yah he ki mak pratyay yajdhatu main lagane par yajmak kintu saadharantaya vishaal aakaar or adhik shakti kii vastuon ke bodhak shabd pulling tathaa durbal env laghu aakaar kii vastuon ke suchak shabd streeling hote hai
