 Badminton is a racquet sport played face-to-face in a rectangular court divided by two opposing players or two opposing pairs from the net
 Players hit the shuttlecock from their racket by dropping half of the court's half of their opposing side's points
 Receive
 ek raily tab samaapt ho jaati he jab shatalkock maidan par gir jaataa he
 Each side can strike the shuttlecock only once before crossing it
 shatalkock chidiyon ke pankhons se bana prakshepya he, jisaki anokhi udaan bharne kii kshamta ke kaaran yah adhikansh racket khelon kii gendon kii tulana main alag tarah se uda karti he
 In particular, the wings can be stretched to a much higher height, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate much faster than the ball
 anya racket ke khelon kii tulana main shatalkock kii sheersh gati bahut adhik hoti he
 Since the flight of shuttlecock is affected by wind, it is good to play badminton competition indoor only
 kabhi-kabhi manoranjan ke liye bageeche yaa samudr tat par bhi khule main badminton khelaa jaataa he
 Since 1992, badminton has been playing an Olympics with five types of events: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles, with each pair consisting of a man and a woman
 khel ke ucch str par, khel utkrisht shaareerik fitness kii maang karata he: khilaadiyon ko aerobics kshamta, dakshata, shakti, gati or durustata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is also a technical game, requiring good operational coordination and development of sophisticated racket gambits
 badminton kii shuruyaat 19veen sadi ke madhya main british bharat main maani ja sakati he, us samay tainaat british sainik adhikariyon dwaara iskaa srijan kiya gaya tha
 In the initial photographs, the British are seen attaching the nets to the British traditional game of bat and shuttlecock
 british chhavnee shahar puna main yah khel khaastaur par lokapriy rahaa, isiilie is khel ko punai ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Initially, the upper classes preferred to play with fleece in wind or wet weather, but eventually the shuttlecock outperformed
 is khel ko sevanivritti ke baad waapas lautanevaale adhikari england le gaye, jahaan ise viksit kiya gaya or niyam banaaye gaye
 Around 1860, Isaac Spratt, a London toy merchant, published a booklet called Badminton Battledore - a new game, but unfortunately no copies survived
 nayaa khel nishchit rup se san 1873 main glustershire sthit beufort ke duk ke swaamitvvaale badminton house main shuru kiya gaya tha
 Until that time, it was known as the "game of badminton" and later the official name of the game became badminton
 san 1887 tak, british bharat main jari niyamon ke hi tahat england main yah khel khelaa jaataa rahaa
 The Bath Badminton Club standardized the rules and the game was molded according to English ideas
 1887 main buniyadi niyam banaaye gaye
 In 1893, the England Badminton Association published the first set of rules according to these regulations, just as they are today, and officially started badminton in a building called "dunbar" of 6 Waverly Grove, Portsmouth, England, on 13 September the same year
 Of
 1899 main, unhone ol england open badminton championships bhi shuru kii, jo vishwa kii pehali badminton pratiyogita bani
 The International Badminton Federation was established in 1934; Canada, Denmark, England, France, Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales became its founders
 bharat san 1936 main ek sahyogi ke rup main shaamil hua
 The BWF now regulates international badminton sports and develops the game worldwide
 haalanki iske niyam england main bane, lekin europe main pratispardhi badminton par paaramparik rup se denmark kaa dabadabaa he
 Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia are among the countries that have consistently produced world class players for the last few decades and dominate international level competitions; These include China, which has been the most dominant in recent years
 nimnlikhit soochna niyam kaa ek sarlikrut saransh he, puri pratilipi nahin he
 The BWF statute is the definitive source of the publication rule, although the numerical distribution of the rule has poor reproductions of the drawing
 court ytaakar hota he or net dwaara do hisson main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 Courts are generally marked for both singles and doubles games, although the rule allows courts to be marked for singles only
 yugal court ekal court se adhik chaude hote hai, lekin donon kii lambaai ek samaan hoti hai
 The exception, which often confuses new players, is that the doubles court's serve-length dimension is small
 court kii puri chaudaai 6
1 meter or ekal kii chaudaai isse kam 5
18 meter hoti he
 The entire length of the court is 13
4 meters
 sarvice court ek madhya rekha dwaara court kii chaudai ko vibhajit karke chinhit hote hai
 It is marked by a short service line at a distance of 1
98 meters from the net and by the outer and rear boundaries
 yugal main, sarvice court ek lambii sarvice rekha dwaara bhi chihnit hoti he, jo pichhali seemaa se 0
78 meter kii duuri par hoti he
 The net rises 1
55 meters at the edges and 1
524 meters in the middle
 net ke khambe yugal parshvarekhaon par khadey hote hai, tab bhi jab ekal khelaa jaataa he
 There is no mention of the minimum ceiling height above the court in the rules of badminton
 phir bhi, aisa badminton court acha nahin mana jaayegaa agar ooncha sarv chat ko chhu jaay
 The rule specifies which device can be used
 vishesh rup se, racket or shatalkock ke dizin or aakaar ko lekar niyam seemaabaddh hai
 The rule also provides for testing the shuttlecock for the correct speed: 3
1 : shatalkock kii jaanch ke liye phul anderhand stroke kaa upyog karen jo shatalkock ko pichhali boundry rekha tak le jaataa he
 The shuttlecock must be hit at an upward angle and in a parallel direction to the side line
 3
2 : sahi gati kaa ek shatalkock anya pichhali boundry line se kam se kam 530 mimi or 990 mimi se zyaada dur nahin giregaa
 Each game is played at 21 points, where the player scores one point after winning a rally
 teen khel main sarvottam kaa ek match hota he
 At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand diagonally to each other in their respective service courts
 sarwar shatalkock ko is tarah hit karata he ki yah resiver ke sarvice court main jaakar gire
 yah tennis ke samaan he, sivaay iske ki badminton sarv qamar kii oonchai ke neeche se hit kiya janaa chahie or racket shaft adhomukhi hona chahie, shatalkock ko bouns karne kii anumati nahin he or badminton main khilaadiyon ko apane sarv corton ke andar khadey rahanaa padataa he, jabaki aisa tennis main nahin hota he
 When the serving side loses a rally, the serve goes to the opponent or rivals
 ekal main, sarwar kaa score sam hota he tab vah apane daahine sarvice court main or jab uskaa score visham hota he tab vah apane baayen sarvice court main khadaa hota he
 In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but has to change service courts so that he or she works for each opponent in turn
 agar virdohi raily jeet jate hai or unka nayaa score sam he, tab daahine sarvice court kaa khilaadi sarv karata he; agar visham he to baayen sarvice court kaa khiladi sarv karata he
 The players' service courts are determined by their place at the start of the last rally, not at the end of the rally where they were standing
 is pranali kaa ek parinaam yah he ki har baar ek said ko sarvice kaa mauka miltaa he, aise khilaadi ko sarwar banane kaa avasar miltaa he jisane pichhali baar sarv nahin kiya tha
 When the server serves, the shuttlecock must cross the short service line in the opponents' court or else it will be considered a lapse
 agar score 20-ol tak pahunch chukaa he, to khel jari rahata he jabatak ki ek paksh do ank kii badhat nahin le letaa, adhiktam 30 ank tak aisa hi chalata rah saktaa he 
 At the beginning of the match, a coin is tossed
 isamen jeetnevaale yah tay kar sakate hai ki ve pehle sarv karenge yaa risive karenge, yaa ve court ke kis chor se pehle khelnaa chahenge
 unke virodhiyon ko bache hue kaa hi chayan karnaa padataa he
 In less formal settings, the coin is often flown into the air by hitting a shuttlecock instead of tossing it, the side of the cork pointing to which side it will serve
 baad ke khel main, pichley khel ke vijeta pehle sarv karte hai
 They can also be called rubbers
 agar ek team ek khel jeet jaati he to ve ek baar phir khelte hai or agar vah ek baar phir se jeet jaati he to vah us match ko hi jeet leti hai, lekin yadi vah haar gayi to unhen match main jeet-haar ke liye ek or match khelnaa padataa he
 For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair can decide who will serve first and the receiving pair can decide who will receive first
 duusare khel kii shuruyaat main khilaadiyon ko apana chor badalanaa hota he; agar match tisare khel tak pahunchataa he, tab game ke aarambh main or phir jab agrani jodi kaa score 11 ank tak pahunchataa he tab, unhen do baar apane chor badalane padate hai
 The server and receiver have to remain in their service court without touching the boundary line, until the server strikes the shuttlecock
 The other two players can stand anywhere they wish, as long as they are out of sight of the opposing server or receiver
 khilaadi shatalkock ko strike karke or use virdohi paksh ke court kii seemaa ke andar giraakar ek raily jite jate hai )
 The player still wins a rally when the opponent makes a mistake
 badminton main sabase aam galati yaa folt he jab khilaadi shatalkock ko waapas bhejne or virdohi court main giraane main vifal hota he, lekin or bhi anya tareeke se khilaadiyon se galati ho sakati he
 Many mistakes are specifically related to service
 serving khilaadi kii galati hogi agar sampark ke samay shatalkock uski qamar se upar ho, yaa sanghaat ke vaqt uske racket kaa sir adhomukhi na ho
 This special rule was amended in 2006: first, the server's racket would have to be downward to the extent that the racket's head was required to remain below the arm from which the racket is held; And now, any angle below the level is acceptable
 na to sarwar or na hi resiver ek pair uthaa sakate hai jab tak ki sarwar shatalkock ko strek na kare
 sarwar ko shuru main shatalkock ke aadhaar par bhi hit karnaa hoga, haalanki vah baad main usee stroke ke ek bhaag ke rup main pankhwale hisse par bhi hit kar saktaa he
 This law was enacted to prohibit a very effective service style known as s-serve or Cdec Serve
 is style ke jariye sarwar shatalkock kii udaan main avyavasthit spin paidaa kiya karte the
 Each side can strike the shuttlecock only once before being sent back across the net; But during a single-stroke movement, a player may approach the shuttlecock twice
 baharhaal, koi khilaadi shatalkock ko ek baar hit karne ke baad phir kisi nayi chaal ke saath use hit nahin kar saktaa, yaa vah shatalkock ko tham yaa sling nahin kar saktaa he
 If the shuttlecock hits the roof it will fault
 agar lats hota he to raily band kar di jaati he or score main bagaiyr koi parivartan ke phir se kheli jaati he
 Some unexpected obstruction can cause lats, for example when a shuttlecock falls into the court or if the shuttle touches the top of the small hall, it can be called lats
 jab sarv kiya gaya tab agar resiver taiyaar nahin he, use lats kaha jayega; phir bhi, agar resiver shatalkock waapas karne kaa prayaas karata he, to maan liya jayega ki vah taiyaar ho gaya
 If the shuttlecock hits the tape, it will not lie
 badminton racket halake hote hai, achche kism ke racket kaa vajan taar sahit 79 or 91 gram ke bich hota he
 These can be made from many different materials, from carbon fiber mixtures to solid steel, with a variety of materials to enhance
 carbon fibre vajan anupaat main ek utkrisht shakti pradaan karata he, jo kathor he or gatij urja kaa sthanantaran bahut badhiya detaa he
 Before carbon fiber mixing, the racket was made in light metals such as aluminum
 isse pehle racket lakdi ke banate the
 Cheap rackets are still often made of metal such as steel, but due to the excessive amount of wood and its price, wooden rackets are no longer made for the general market
 aajkal, adhik se adhik tikaaupan dene ke liye naino material jaise phullerene or carbon nanotub ko bhi racket banane main shaamil kiya ja rahaa hai
 There are many variations in racket design, although the size and size of the regulation racket has been fixed
 alag-alag khilaadiyon ke khel ke andaaz ke liye vibhinn tarah ke racket hote hai
 Traditional upper oval racquets are still available, but a isometric shaped racket is becoming increasingly common
 ve zyaadaatar khilaadiyon main bahut lokapriy hai
 Badminton wires are thin, very well performing wires in the range of 0
65 to 0
73 mm thickness
 motaa taar adhik tikaoo hota he, lekin zyaadaatar khilaadi patale taar pasand karte hai
 The tension of the wire is usually from 80 to 130 N
 peshewar ke bajaae shaukia khiladi aamtaur par taar kam kasaav main rakhte hai, khaas taur se 18 or 25 pound-bal ke bich hota he
 Professional wire tension between about 25 and 36 lb-force
 aksar yah tark diya jaataa he, taar kaa kasaav niyantran ko unnat banaata he, jabaki kam kasaav shakti main vruddhi karata he
 The device used for this is usually applied as a crude mechanical logic, such that the base of a less tight wire is more bouncy and therefore provides more power
 darasal yah galat he, vastav main, ek ucch kasaavvaale taar ke kaaran shatal racket se phisal saktaa he or isiilie shot thik se maar paanaa mushkil hota he
 An alternative suggests that the best tightness for strength depends on the player: high tightness for the highest strength allows the player to wave his racket more quickly and more accurately
 kisi bhi vichaar ke liye na to kade yantric vishleshan kii zarurat he or na hi iske yaa duusare ke paksh main spasht saboot hai
 The most effective way for a player that has a good string tension is to experiment
 pakad yaa grip kii pasand khilaadi ko apane racket ke mutthe kii motaai main vruddhi or pakad ke liye aaramdaayak sataha ke chunaav karne kii anumati detii he
 Before placing the final layer, the player can prepare a fold of racket with one or several grips
 khiladi grip kii vibhinn prakaar kii saamagree ke bich chunaav kar sakate hai
 Most PU is the practice of synthetic grip or toweling grip
 grip kii pasand nijee praathamikta kaa maamla he
 Sweating is often a problem for players; In this case, the grip or a drawing agent may be applied to the hand, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another type of grip material or change the grip repeatedly
 mukhya prakaar ke do grip hai: riplacement grip or overgrips 
 riplacement grip motaa hota he or aksar iskaa istemaal mutthe kii maap main vruddhi main kiya jaataa he
 Overgrips are thin and are often used as the last layer
 baharhaal, bahut saare khiladi antim parat ke rup main riplacement grip kaa upyog karnaa pasand karte hai
 Toweling grips are always replacement grips
 riplacement grip chipakane vaala hota he, jabaki overgrips tepe ke shuru main chipakane vaale keval chote ptch hote hai or kasaav ke aadhaar par ise lagaaya janaa chahie; overgrips un khilaadiyon ke liye or adhik suvidhajanak hai jo aksar grip baar-baar badalte hai, kyonki bagaiyr kharaab hue ve antarnihit saamagree ko jaldi-jaldi badal de sakate hai
 The shuttlecock is an open cone-shaped high-flying projectile: a cone is made of sixteen overlapping interconnected wings in the base of the cork
 cork ko maheen chamade yaa synthetic saamagree se dhank diya jaataa he
 Since wing shuttles break easily, synthetic shuttles are often used by amateur players to reduce their costs
 ye nylon shatal yaa to prakritik cork yaa kritrim fom base or plastic ke ghere se banaaye jate hai
 Additionally, there are three varieties of nylon shuttlecock, each with different temperatures
 ye teen kism ke hoe hai; haraa, nila or laal ke liye
 Therefore, a colored strip sticking around the cork indicates color and movement
 thande taapmaana main tej shatal kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or garm mausam main dhimen ko chunaa jaataa he
 Badminton shoes are lightweight under weight or made of non-marking material with similar high grip
 daudnevaale juuton kii tulana main, badminton juute thodaa parshvik avlambanwaale hote he
 High level lateral recumbency is useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unpredictable
 baharhaal, badminton main shaktishaalee parshv gati kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In badminton, a high-built lateral recumbency will not be able to protect the feet, instead, in a place where the shoe does not have recumbency, it will fall catastrophically and the player's ankles are not ready for a sudden load
 May cause sprains
 is kaaran, badminton khilaadiyon ko saamaanya prashikshu yaa dhaavak juuton ke bajaae badminton juuton kaa chunaav karnaa chahie, kyoki sateek badminton juuton main ek bahut hi patala-sa tala, vyakti ke gurutvkarshan ke centre ko kam karne vaala hota he or isliye chot kii kam gunjaaish hoti he
 Players should also ensure the alignment of knees and feet with the use of safe and appropriate steps in all types of strikes
 yah na keval suraksha ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he, court main prabhavi tareeke se gati banaaye rakhane ke liye uchit qadamon kaa upyog bhi myne rakhata he
 Badminton has a lot of basic strokes and players need a very high level of skill to perform effectively
 sabhi stroke yaa to forehand yaa bacand se khele ja sakate hai
 a player's forehand side is the side of his playing hand: For a right-handed player the forehand side is his right side and the backhand side is his left side
 pramukh hatheli se forehand stroke daahine haath ke saamne se maaraa jaataa he, jabaki bacand stroke daahine haath ke peeche se maaraa jaataa he 
 Players often play a few strokes with the backhand side of the forehand side and vice versa
 saamne ke court or madhya court main, yaa to forehand yaa phir bacand said se samaan prabhavi tareeke se zyaadaatar stroke khele ja sakate hai; lekin court ke pichley bhaag se khilaadi apane forehand se jitna sambhav ho utane stroke khilne kaa prayaas karata he, praayah bacand overhead ke bajaae sir ke paas se forehand overhead khelnaa pasand karata he
 There are two main disadvantages of playing a backhand overhead
 sabase pehle, khilaadi apane virodhiyon kii ore apni peeth jarur karata he, isse vah unhen or court ko nahin dekh paata he
 Secondly, backhand overheads may not hit with as much force as forehand: the shoulder joint restricts hitting action, allowing for a much larger range of forehand overhead operations rather than backhand
 khel main adhikansh khilaadi or coach bacand clear ko kathin buniyadi stroke maanate hai, kyonki shatalkock court kii puri lambaai main yatra kare iske liye paryaapt shakti batorne ke kram main sateek takanic kii zaroorat hoti he
 For the same reason, backhand smashes become weaker
 stroke kaa chunaav is baat par nirbhar karata he ki shatalkock net ke kitne najadik he, kahin yah net kii oonchai se upar to nahin he or virdohi kii vartmaan sthiti kahaan he: agar ve net kii oonchai ke upar shatalkock tak pahunch sakate hai to khilaadi behatar hamale kii sthiti main hote hai
 In the forecourt, an elevated shuttlecock will be met by a net kill, hitting it rapidly downwards, trying to win the rally immediately
 This is why it is better to let the shuttlecock fall on the net in this situation
 In midcourt, the elevated shuttlecock is usually made a powerful smash, it hits the bottom and is expected to win a complete win or a weak answer
 kasarati kud smash, jahaan khilaadi neeche kii ore smash kone ke liye upar kii ore uchhalata he, yah elite purushon ke dubles khel kaa ek aam or shandaar tatv he
 In the rearcourt, instead of allowing the shuttlecock to come down, the player is desperate to kill him while he is on top of them
 yah overhead aghat unhen kai tarah ke smash, clears or dropashots khilne kii anumati detaa he
 If the shuttlecock comes down a bit, the smash is impossible and the entire length, high clear is difficult
 jab shatalkock net kii oonchai se khaasaa neeche he, to khilaadiyon ke paas upar kii taraf maarane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin rahata he
 Lifts where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to move past the opponents' court can be played from any part of the court
 agar khilaadi lift nahin karata he, uske paas shatalkock ko dhire se net kii ore kar dene kaa hi vikalp shesh rah jaataa he: four court main yah net short kehalaata he, mid court main yah aksar push yaa block kehalaata he
 When the shuttlecock is close to the height of the net, players can hit drives, which go flat and quickly over the net in opponents' midcourt and rear courts
 midcourt ke saamne shatalkock ko le jate hue push or bhi sapaat hit kar saktaa he
 Drives and pushes can be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are often used in doubles: they are used to retrieve the attack, rather than trying to lift the shuttlecock or defend with a smash
 ek safal push yaa drivs ke baad, virdohi aksar shatalkock ko lift karne ke liye majaboor ho jaaenge
 When defending against a smash, the player has three basic options: lift, block, or drive
 In singles, block in the net is a very common response
 yugal main, ek lift sabase surakshit vikalp he, lekin aamtaur par yah virodhiyon ko lagaataar smash kii anumati detaa he; block or drive muqabla karne ke stroke hai, par smash karanevaale ke saajhedaar dwaara bich main roka ja saktaa he
 Many players hit the bankhand to return the smash to both the forehand and backhand side, as the backhand is more effective than the forehand for smashes coming directly to the body
 sarvice niyam dwaara pratibandhit he or yah apane hi kism ke stroke kaa chunaav karne ke liye vyuh pesh karata he
 Unlike tennis, the racket of the server must be aimed downwards while serving, usually the shuttle must be struck upward so that it passes over the net
 The server can choose a low serve in the forecourt, or a lift behind the service court, or a flat drive serve
 lift sarv yaa to hai sarv hona chahie, jahaan shatalkock itnaa upar uth jaae ki vah lagbhag khadi disha main court ke peeche jaakar gire, yaa flik sarv, jahaan shatalkock kam oonchai par uthe lekin jald hi gir jaae
 Once a player has mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock on any part of the court with full force and as slowly as necessary
 buniyadi baton ke alaava, tathaapi, badminton unnat stroke lagane ke kaushal ke liye acchhee kshamta pradaan karata he jo pratispardhaatmak laabh detaa hai
 Because badminton players have to cover the shortest distance possible as quickly as possible, the aim is to give Virodi several very advanced strokes, so that he either gets into the trick that a different stroke has been played, or He is forced to slow down his speed until he sees the direction of the shuttle
 In badminton, "trickery" is often used in both of these ways
 jab khilaadi vastav main chalbaazi karata he, aksar vah usee dam point kho degaa kyonki vah shatalkock tak pahunchane ke liye apane disha utani jaldi nahin badal saktaa
 anbhavi khilaadi chaal ke prati jaagruk honge or bahut jald hi kadam badhaane ke prati sachet honge, lekin chalbaasike prayaas phir bhi upyogi hote hai, kyonki yah virdohi ko apni gati ko dhimaa karne ko majaboor kar dete hai
 a weak player who is about to hit a stroke, the experienced player moves before his or her shuttlecock hits in order to benefit from that stroke
 slising or showended hiting ection do mukhya takneekee upkaran hai jo chalbaazi karne main sahuuliyat dete hai
 Slicing is related to hitting the shuttlecock with an angle to the front of the racket, causing it to move in a different direction than the movement suggested by the body and arms
 slising se shatalkock baajuon dwaara dikhaayi gayi gati ke bajaae bahut hi dhime bhi jaataa he
 For example, a good crosscourt slipped dropshort that uses both the ability and direction of the shuttlecock to hit the opponent with a loud hit that is either clear or smash
 ek bahut hi parishkrut slising kaarywahi hit karne ke dauraan shatalkock ko ghumaane ke liye iske chaaron ore taar se brushing karne se judaa he
 It can be used to increase the trajectory of a shuttle by moving through the net at a very steep depth; For example, the sliced low serve can travel a bit faster than the normal low serve, yet falls in the same place
 shatalkock spinning netshort kii bhi rachana karata he jisamen shatalkock sthir hon se pehle apane aap kai baar gumti he; kabhi-kabhi shatalkock ludhakne ke bajaae aundha rah jaataa he
 The major advantage of a spinning netshort is that the opponent will not want to take it until the shuttlecock stops rolling, as the result of an unexpected stroke in the wings
 spinning netshort oonche darje ke ekal khilaadi ke liye vishesh mahatv kaa hota he
 The lightness of modern rackets allows the player to use a short hitting action to retain the option of hitting a powerful or light stroke until the last possible moment for multiple strokes
 udhaaharan ke liye, ekal khilaadi netshort ke liye apane racket ko pakde rakh saktaa he, lekin iske baad shatalkock ko waapas karne ke liye uthle lift ke bajaae flik kar detaa he
 This makes it harder for the opponent to swing while covering the entire court rather than lift with a big hit
 chalbaasike liye ek short hiting karrwai upyogi nahin hota he: khilaadi ke paas jab bade arm swing kaa samay nahin hota tab yah use shaktishaalee stroke maarane kii anumati detaa he
 Strong grip is very important in such techniques and is often described as finger power
 sambhraant khilaadi ek had tak finger power ko viksit karte hai taaki ve kuch shaktishaalee stroke, jaise ki racket ko 10 senmi se kam swing karakar net kil, maar saken
 It is also possible to reverse this style of trickery by powerful strokes before the hitting action slows down to play a soft stroke
 rurcourt main saamanyatya chalbaaziki pichhali style bahut aam he, jabaki badwali style forcourt or midcourt main bahut aam he
 Deception is not limited to slicing and short hitting action
 jahaan khilaadi duusari disha main maarane se racket ko bachaane se pehle ek disha main racket kaa praarambhik sanchaalan karata he vahaan vah dabl moshan kaa bhi istemaal kar saktaa he
 It usually suggests the use of a crosscourt angle, but plays the stroke straight or vice versa
 tripal moshan bhi sambhav he, lekin asli khel main yah bahut hi viral hota he
 Counterfeit use of the upper part of the racket is an alternative to double motion, where the racket rotates during a hit, even while the initial motion continues
 isse disha main halkaa-sa badlaav aata he, lekin isamen zyaada samay kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 To win in badminton, players need different strokes in the right position
 iskaa range shaktishaalee kud kar smash karne se lekar net se vaapasi ke liye sookshm ludhakaane tak he
 Often rallies end with a smash, but a sharp stroke is required to establish the smash
 udhaaharan ke liye, shatalcork ko uthaane ke liye netshort virdohi ko majaboor kar saktaa he, jo smash kaa avasar pradaan karata he
 If the netshort is tight and rolling, the opponent's lift will reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash too difficult for a comeback
 chalbaazi bhi mahatvapurn he
 Experts create a variety of strokes of the player who look alike and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke
 yadi koi pratidwandvi stroke kaa anumaan lagane kii koshish karata he, to vah galat disha main chalaa ja saktaa he or thik samay par shatalkock tak pahunchane ke liye apane sharir kii gati ko badalane main asamarth ho saktaa he
 Both pairings will try to take advantage and retain the attack by smashing downwards whenever possible
 jab bhi sambhav ho, jodi adarsh hamale kaa vyuh banaaenge, ek khilaadi rurcourt se neeche kii ore se hit karata he or uskaa saajhedaar midcourt main lift ko chhod kar sabhi smash ko bich main hi rokte hue lautaane ke saath
 agar rurcourt kaa hamalavar dropshort kheltaa he, uskaa saajhedaar forcourt main jate hue net kaa khatara lete hue forcourt kii ore badhegaa
 agar jodi hit nahin kar sakati he to hamale kaa laabh uthaane kii koshish main ve sapaat stroke kaa upyog karenge
 They must defend if the pair are forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock: they are positioned close to cover the entire width of their court to counter the opponent's smash in the rear midcourt
 Will adopt
 In the doubles game, the player usually smashes in the middle ground to take advantage of the confusion and confrontation between the two players
 ucch str ke khel main, bacand sarv is had tak lokapriy ho gaya he ki peshewar khel main forehand sarv lagbhag dikhaai hi nahin detaa he
 Low serve has been used extensively in an attempt to prevent the opponent from taking advantage of the attack
 virdohi ko pehle se hi lo sarv kii ummadi rakhane or nirnaayak rup se hamalaa karne se rokane ke liye flik sarv kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In high level sports, doubles rally is very fast
 ucch anupaat main puri takat se kud kar smash karne ke saath purushon kaa yugal badminton kaa sabase aakraamak rup he
 The singles court is narrower than the doubles court, but is similar in length, singles in serve and back box in doubles
 kyonki puure court ko cover karne ke liye ek vyakti jaruri hota he, ekal ranneeti virdohi ko jitna sambhav ho sake utana chalane ke liye baadhya karne par aadhaarit hoti he; iskaa matlab yah he ki ekal stroke aamtaur par court ke kone se judaa hota he
 The player takes advantage of the full length of the court by combining lift and clear with dropshot and netshort
 yugal kii tulana main ekal main smash kam hi dekhne main aata he, kyonki khilaadi smash karne kii adarsh sthiti main kam hi hote hai or agar smash waapas laut kar aata he to smash karanevaale ko aksar chot lag jaati he
 In singles, the player will most likely begin the rally with a forehand high serve
 lagaataar lo sarv yaa to forehand yaa phir bacand kaa bhi upyog hota he
 The flick serve is rare and the drive serve is rare
 ucch str ke khel main, ekal main ullekhneey fitness kii jararat hoti he
 Unlike the very aggressiveness of the doubles, singles are a game of patient situational betting
 mishrit yugal main saamne kii ore mahila or peeche kii ore purush ke saath donon jodi aakraamakata ko barkaraar rakhane kii koshish karti he
 The reason for this is that male players who are very strong and therefore the smashes they do are very powerful
 natijatan, mishrit yugal main ranneetik jaagrukta or sookshmatar sthitijanya khel kii bahut zaroorat hoti he
 The clever adversary will try to change their ideal position by forcing the woman backwards and the man to come forward
 is khatre se bachane ke liye, mishrit khilaadi ko apane shot kaa chunaav karne main chaukanna or vyavasthit hona hoga
 In high-level games, the structure is usually flexible: the top female player is able to play with full force from the rearcourt and will do so happily when needed
 However, when the opportunity arises, the pair will again go into the standard mixed offensive position by keeping the woman in front of them
 baayen haath ke khilaadi ko daahine haath ke khilaadi ke khilaaf ek swaabhaavik laabh mil jaataa he
 This is because most of the right hand players are there in the world
 agar aap baayen haath se khelte hai, forehand or bacand badal jaataa he, isliye aapke daahine ore ke court main ek shot kaa parinaam aapke khilaaf ek bahut hi shaktishaalee smash hoga
 For this reason, the left-handed players will be inclined to take more and more shots towards their forehand and as a result their bankhand is not fully trained
 isliye, baayen haath ke khilaadi kii mukhya kamajori uskaa bacand hota he
 Knowing this, a left-handed player should try to play most of his shots on the left side of the court
 aisa isliye kyonki daahine haath ke vyakti kaa forehand hone ke baavjood, shot kii vaapasi bhi aapke forehand kii ore hogi yah sunishchit karegaa ki aap smashing jari rakh sakate hai
 It is said that left-handed smashes are better
 yah aanshik rup se sahi he kyonki baayen haath kaa khilaadi durlabh kone banane main sakasham hota he or isliye bhi ki shatalkock par pankh is tarah lage hue hote hai jo baayen haath ke khilaadi kii madad karte hai 
 However, a left-handed player will find himself confused when he is playing with an equivalent partner
 unnat str ke khel main baayen haath / daahine haath kii yugal jodi bahut hi aam he
 This is because they have a distinct advantage over a pair of right-handed / right-handed or left-handed / left-handed doubles
 sabase ullekhneey laabh yah he ki court kaa koi bhi said kamjor nahin hota he
 This gives the opposing team more time to think about which side is the backhand and where to send the shuttlecock, as against a normal right / right pair you usually almost always send to your right side of the court, while LH The / RH pair make changes to their weaker side during the rally
 baayen haath ke khilaadi ko smash karne main bhi ek anya laabh miltaa he
 The bird's shuttlecock has a natural spin, so when shooting the shuttlecock lightly diagonally with the left hand, you take advantage of the natural spin and drag and smash it
 jab ek daahine haath kaa khilaadi apane bacand se shot ko slis karata he tab ek hi prabhaav padataa he
 a very good example of this is Tan Boon Heong, a left-handed player with a world record of 421 km / h

 The most powerful stroke in badminton is the smash, which is rapidly hit downwards into the opponents' midcourt
 smash kiye gaye shatalkock kii adhiktam gati duusare kisi anya racket khel ke prakshepya se kahin adhik hoti he
 The recording of this speed is measured by the initial speed of the shuttlecock immediately after the player is released from the racket

 Badminton is often compared to tennis
 gaiyr vivaadaaspad tulana kii ek suchi is prakaar he: Other comparisons of agile badminton enthusiasts are more controversial than statistics such as smash speed, 261 miles / hour
 udhaaharan ke liye, aksar yah daawa kiya jaataa he ki badminton sabase tezi se chalane vaala racket kaa khel he
 Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed in racket sports, shuttlecocks are actually significantly faster than other projections such as tennis balls
 iske alaava, is yogyata shatalkock ke duuri tay kiye jane ke dwaara kaabil vivechit hona chahie: ek ko mitaa diya shatalkock ek kii seva ke dauraan ek tennis gend se ek kam duuri kii yatra karata he
 Badminton as the fastest racket sport can also be claimed based on reaction time requirements, but arguably table tennis also requires faster reaction times
 is baat ke paksh main kaaphi majboot tark he ki tennis kii tulana main badminton kahin adhik shaareerik kshamta kii maang karata he, lekin khelon kii apni alag-alag maangon ko dekhte hue is tarah kii tulana ko nishpaksh bananaa mushkil hota he
 Some informal studies indicate that badminton requires greater aerobic capacity than tennis players, but very rigorous research has not been done on this topic
 nimnlikhit tulana main or adhik santulit ravaiya sujhaayaa gaya he, haalanki ye bhi vivaad ke vishay hai: The techniques of badminton and tennis are quite different
 shatalkock kaa halkaapan or badminton racket ke tennis khilaadiyon kii tulana main badminton khilaadi ko kalai or ungaliyon kaa upyog zyaada karne kii anumati detaa he; tennis main aam taur par kalai sthir rahata he or kalai ghumaane se chot lag sakati he
 For the same reason, badminton players can build strength with a small swing of the racket: in similar strokes such as net kills, the big players are 5 cm
 Can swing less than
 aisa stroke jisamen adhik takat kii zarurat padati he aamtaur par lambey swing kaa istemaal kiya jayega, lekin tennis swing kii tarah badminton racket bahut birla hi swing hoga
 It is often said that badminton stroke is mainly associated with the wrist
 yah ek galatafahami he or do kaarnon se isaki aalochana kii ja sakati he
 First, it can be called a square error: the wrist is a joint, not a muscle, the arm muscles control its movement
 doosraa, aage kii yaa upree baanh ke harakat kii tulana main kalai kii harakat kamjor hoti he
 Badminton biomechanics is not the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the small role of the wrist in power generation and indicate that strength plays a major role in the internal and external rotation of the upper and lower arms
 aadhunik koching sansaadhan jaise badminton england takanic DVD in vichaaron ko kalai kii harkaton ke bajaae agali baanh par jor dene ke dwaara darshaate hai
 The shuttlecock is very different from most other racket games that use balls
 pankh majboot draig pradaan karata he is kaaran shatalkock jor se kaaphi dur girtaa he
 The shuttlecock is also stabilized by rapid aerodynamics: regardless of the initial orientation, it will spin first towards the cork and remain oriented toward the cork
 shatalkock ke draig kaa ek mahatva yah he ki court kii puri lambaai main maarane ke liye isamen paryaapt kaushal kii zaroorat padati he, jo zyaadaatar racket vaale khel ke liye nahin he
 Drag also affects the flight path raised above the shuttlecock: its flight parabola is very skewed and falls through a sloping angle instead of rising upwards
 bahut oonche sarv ke saath bhi shatalkock ekadam lamberup main gir saktaa he
 The ball can rotate to change its bounce, and the player can slice for such a spin; Since the shuttlecock does not allow bouncing, it does not apply in badminton
 shatalkock ko aisa slis kare ki vah gum jaae, haalanki yah prayog he or kuch khaas rup se badminton ke liye hai
 Its wings are interconnected in such a way that the shuttlecock naturally rotates round its axis
 jab shatalkock girtaa he tab yah ghadi kii vipareet disha main jaisaa ki upar dikhaaya gaya he ghumta he
 Some strokes are affected by natural movement: a tumbling netshot is much more effective if the slicing action is from right to left rather than left to right

 But there is abundant evidence of excavation of Sindhundi kadha antiquities that five thousand years ago, agriculture was in a very advanced state and people were paying revenue in the form of food grains, according to the large rooms found in archaeologist Muhanjodado

 Dwayne Johnson on the Internet Movie Database nimnatapiki, tusharajaniki yaa prashitani bhautikee kii vah shakha he, jisamen atyadhik nimna taap utpann karne va uske anuprayogon ke adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The origin of cryogenic is derived from the Greek word cryos meaning cold as ice
 is shakha main taapmaana par kaam kiya jaataa he
 Processes and measures using this low temperature are studied under cryogenic engineering
 yahaan dekha jaataa he ki kam taapmaana par dhaatuon or gaison main kis prakaar ke parivartan aate hai
 Many metals become more solid at lower temperatures than before
 saral shabdon main yah sheethal taapmaana par dhaatuon ke ascharyajanak vyavhaar ke adhyayan kaa vigyaan hota he
 One of its branches studies the effect of refrigeration on electronic elements and in another the effect of refrigeration on humans and plants
 kuch vaigyanik tusharajaniki ko puri tarah kam taapmaana taiyaar karne kii vidhi se jodakar dekhte hai jabaki kuch kam taapmaana par dhaatuon main aane vaale parivartan ke adhyayan ke rup main
 The range of temperature studied in cryogenics is quite high
 kuch vaigyanikon ke anusaar isamen -180° fahrenheit se neeche ke taapmaana par hi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This temperature is well below the refrigeration point of water and when metals are brought up to this temperature, amazing effects are seen on them
 itnaa kam taapmaana taiyaar karne ke kuch tareeke hote hai, jaise vishesh prakaar ke prasheetak yaa nitrogen jaisi taral gas, jo anukool daab kii sthiti main taapmaana ko niyantrit kar sakati he
 Metals increase the efficiency of their molecules when they are cooled by frost
 isse vah dhaatu pehle se thos or majboot ho jate hai
 Many drugs are prepared by this method and various metals are also preserved
 rocket or antariksh yaan main cryogenic eendhan kaa prayog bhi hota he
 Blight genetics are also used in GSLV rockets

 rocket main prayukt hone vaali dravya eendhan chaalit ingine main eendhan bahut kam taapmaana par bharaa jaataa he, isliye aise ingine cryogenic rocket ingine kehalaate hai
 In such rocket engines, extremely cold and liquefied gases are used as fuel and oxidizer
 is ingine main hydrogen or eendhan kramash: eendhan or oxikaarak kaa kaary karte hai
 They prove to be many times more powerful than solid fuels and give a boost to rockets
 visheshkar lambii duuri or baari rocketon ke liye yah takanic aavashyak hoti he
 One branch of frost-based conservation is called cryonic
 sambhav he ki iske madhyam se bhavishya main chikitsa takanic dwaara manushya or pashuon ke shariron ko prashithan main sangrakshit kar rakhaa ja saken
 It will be possible to do this only under controlled conditions
