 In 1968–1969, a new navigation system supporting the Navy as well as air, land and space forces was conceived
 aupchaarik aavashyaktaaon ko 1970 main puraa kiya gaya; sarkaar ne "ekikrut antariksh nevigation pranali" kaa vikaas shuru karne kaa faisla kiya
 The work of preparing the design of GLONASS was entrusted to a group of young experts of NPO PM in the city of Krasnoyarsk-26
 Under the leadership of Vladimir Cheremicin, he developed several proposals, from which the Director of the Institute Grigory Chernivsky selected the final proposal
 is kaam ko 1970 ke dashak ke antim daur main puraa kiya gaya; is pranali main madhyam vrittakar kaksh main 20,000 kimi kii oonchai par sanchalit hone vaale 24 upgrah shaamil honge
 The system will be able to quickly locate the receiving station position based on signals received from 4 satellites and will also be able to disclose the speed and direction of the object

 US media in its news described the incident as the launch of a satellite and "two secret objects"
 kaaphi samay tak americanyon ko un "vastuon" kii prakruti kaa pataa nahin chal sakaa
 Covering this launch, the Soviet Union Telegraph Agency described GLONASS as a system that was "designed to track the positions of the Soviet Union's civil aviation aircraft, naval transport and boats used for fishing"
 1982 se april 1991 tak soviet sangh ne kul milakar 43 glonas sambandhi upgrahon or paanch pareekshan upgrahon kaa safal prakshepan kiya
 At the time of the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, twelve operational GLONASS satellites were operating in two aircraft, which was enough for limited use of the system
 roosi sangh ne upgrah samooh kaa niyantran apane haath main le liya or iskaa vikaas jari rakhaa
 In 1993, the system was formally declared operational, which now had 12 satellites, and in December 1995 the satellite group was finally brought to its optimum position, which included 24 operational satellites
 isane glonas kii parishuddhta ko america jeepies pranali ke baraabar laakar khadaa kar diya jisane do saal pehle sampoorn sanchaalan kshamta hasil kii thi
 With each of the first generation satellites operating for 3 years, the system required two launches every year to maintain the entire network of 24 satellites to retain full capacity

 As a preamble to demilitarization, the responsibility of the program was handed over from the Ministry of Defense to Russia's civilian space agency Roskosmos
 2000 ke dashak ke shuruuaati daur main vladimir putin kii adhyakshata main roosi arthvyavastha main sudhaar hua or rajya ke vitt main kaaphi sudhaar hua
 Putin himself took a special interest in GLONASS and the restoration of this system was made one of the top priorities of the government
 is prayojan ke liye agast 2001 ko sangheey lakshyit kaarykram "vaishvik nevigation pranali" 2002-2011 kaa shubharambh kiya gaya
 The program had a budget of $ 420 million and was intended to restore the entire satellite group by 2009
 10 disambar 2003 ko duusari peedi ke upgrah dizin glonas-em ko pehali baar prakshepit kiya gaya
 Its mass was slightly higher than the base GLONASS weighing 1415 kg but its life span was twice that of the original satellite, reducing the required replacement rate by 50 percent
 nae upgrah main bhi do atirikt asainik sanketon ko prasaarit karne kii kshamta or behatar sateekta thi
 In 2006, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov ordered one of those signs to be made available to civilian users
 haalanki putin isse santusht nahin the or unki maang kii thi ki sampoorn pranali ko puri tarah se sabhi ke liye uplabdh karaayaa janaa chahie
 As a result, on 18 May 2007 all restrictions were lifted

 As of June 2008, the system had 16 satellites, of which 12 satellites were fully operational at that time
 is samay roscosmos kaa uddeshy pehle yojanabaddh samay seemaa se ek saal baad 2010 tak kaksha main 24 upgrahon kaa ek sampoorn upgrah samooh sthapit karnaa tha
 The military importance of having a domestic, independent satellite navigation system was understood during the 2008 South Ossetia War in August 2008: the US GPS system had completely enveloped the area during hostilities
 sitambar 2008 main pradhanmantri vladimir putin ne sangheey bajet se glonas ko atirikt 67 billian rabal aavantit karne ke liye ek decri par hastakshar kiya
 Although the GLONASS satellite group is approaching global coverage, its commercialization is particularly behind the growth of the user segment compared to the US GPS system

 In the final round of 2010, only a handful of GLONASS receivers were available on the market and very few of them were made for ordinary consumers
 isaki sthiti main sudhaar laane ke liye roosi sarkaar sakriy rup se naagarik upyog ke liye glonas ko badhaava de rahi he
 To improve the growth of the user segment, on 11 August 2010 Sergei Ivanov announced plans to impose a 25% import duty on all GPS forgiving devices, including mobile phones, while being compatible with GLONASS

 aadhunik manovigyaani durghatana ko nae andaaj se dekhte hai
 They believe that labor laws are different in different countries, so the definition of accident also varies
 ek samay tha jab durghatana ko daivi prerana kaa kaaran mana jaataa tha
 With the development of science and the advent of psychology in industry, this old belief was considered meaningless
 is samasya kii ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan gaya, dhire-dhire audyogic kshetra main is prashn par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya gaya
 Scholars compiled important items related to the accident and made it the main subject of their research
 pashchimi deshon ne is disha main bahut pragati kii
 The scholars of India presented important facts to the general public
 aadhunik udyogon main durghatana ko abhishaap samajha jaataa he
 These accidents cause huge damage to the industry
 durghatana ke nimnlikhit kaaran hai - Accidents can be prevented by adopting the following methods - aam upyog main, pratijaivik yaa antibiotic ek padaarth yaa yogic he, jo jeevanu ko maar daalata he yaa uske vikaas ko roktaa he
 There is a broad group of antibacterial antimicrobial compounds, which are used to treat infections caused by bacteria seen by microscopes, including fungi and protozoa
 "antibiotic" shabd kaa prayog 1942 main cellman voxman dwaara kisi ek sookshm jeev dwaara utpann kiye gayi thos yaa taral padaarth ke liye kiya gaya, jo ucch tanukaran main anya sookshmjivon ke vikaas ke virdohi hote hai
 This basic definition does not contain naturally occurring solids or liquids that are capable of killing bacteria, but are not produced by microorganisms, and do not contain synthetic antibacterial compounds such as sulfonamide
 kai pratijaivik apekshaakrit chote anu hote hai, jinka bhaar 2000 Da se bhi kam hota hai
 Along with the advancement of medicinal chemistry, most antibiotics are now synthetic, chemically modified from basic compounds found in nature, as in the case of betalactam
 kuch pratijaivik dawaaon kaa utpaadan abhi bhi aminoglaicosaidajaise jivit jeevon ke jariye hota he or unhen alag-thalag rakhna jaataa he or anya puri tarah kritrim tareekon- jaise salphonamides,quinolonsoroxajolidinonsase banaaye jate hai
 Antibiotics can be broadly divided into two groups according to their classification based on origin - their effect on microorganisms in addition to natural, semisynthetic and synthetic: one, which kills bacteria, is called bactericidal agent and Those that impair the growth of bacteria are called bacteriostatic agents
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat se pehle kai sankramak rogon ke ilajaushadheey lokoktiyon par aadhaarit hote the
 The use of plant-derived antibiotics to treat infections in ancient Chinese medicine began 2,500 years ago
 pracheen misr,pracheen unani or madhyayugin arab jaisi kai pracheen sabhyataaon main sankraman ke ilaaj ke liye fafoond or paudhon kaa istemaal hota tha
 In the 17th century, bark of quinine was widely used to treat malaria, caused by the protozoan parasite of the pathogen Plasmodium
 bimaariyaan kyon hoti hai, yah jaanane-samajhane ke vaigyanik prayaason, synthetic pratijaivik chemotherapy ke vikaas or prakritik pratijaivik dawaaon kaa pruthakkaran pratijaivik ke vikaas main mile ke pathar sabit hue
 There are basically antibiotics called antibiosis which work against bacteria
 antibiosis shabd kaa matlab he "jivan ke khilaaf" or isaki shuruyaat france ke jeevanu vigyanivillemin ne in dawaaon ke asar kaa varnan karne ke liye kii
 or baad main pratijaivik penicillin kii khoj ke baad salvarsan kaa pratijaivik ke rup main istemaal khatm ho gaya
 In 1932, after Erlich's works, which led to the birth of the antibiotic revolution, Domec discovered proantosil
 The first commercially available antibacterial antibacterial protosil was developed by a team led by Gerhard Domeck at IG Farben Conglomerate Kaber Laboratories in Germany
 prontosil kaa gram positive cocai par apekshaakrit vyapak prabhaav dikhaa or yah introbacteria ke khilaaf bhi nahin tha
 The development of this first sulfonamide drug marked the beginning of the era of antibiotics
 prakritik sookshmjivon dwaara utpaadit pratijaivik dawaaon kii khoj sookshm jeevon ke bich antibiosis ke nirikshan par pehle kiye gayi kaam se prabhavit thi
 Pasteur said that "if we can interfere in the process of conflict between some bacteria, then it will probably create a lot of hope for medical science"
 John Tyndan was first described in England in 1875 by penicillium spp bacteria
 haalanki, unke kaam par 1928 main alexander fleming dwaara penicillin kii khoj kiye jane tak vaigyanik samudaay ne zyada dhyaan nahin diya
 yahaan tak ki tab penicillin kii chikitsiya kshamta par puraa vishwaas nahin tha
 Ten years after that, Ernst Chen and Howard Florey b
 Interest in Fleming's work took place after the discovery of another natural antibiotic that was discovered by Brevis and named Germicidin
 In 1939, Rene Dubos received distinct recognition of germicidin as the first commercially produced antibiotic used in the treatment of wounds and ulcers during World War II
 Florey and Chan succeeded in purifying penicillin
 This purified antibiotic demonstrated antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria
 isamen vishaaktata bhi kam thi or pratikul prabhaav paidaa kiye bina inhen liya ja saktaa tha
 Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological components such as pus, as was the case with the use of synthetic antibiotic sulfonamide available at the time
 itani taqatvar pratijaivik kii khoj abhootpurv thi
 The development of penicillin aroused renewed interest in the discovery of antibiotic compounds with similar capacities
 His discovery of penicillin led to the joint Nobel Prize in 1945 to Ernst Chen, Howard Florey
 flore ne puri dridhta se or vyavasthit rup se jeevanurodhi yogicon kii khoj prarambh karne kaa shrey dubose ko diya
 isi tarah kii paddati kii vajah se jarmicidin kii khoj hui, jisane penicillin main flore kii khoj ko punerjeevit kiya
 Evaluation of the activities of an antibiotic is important for the successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy
 gaiyr-sookshmdarshi vishaanuon ke kaarak, jaise mejabaan pratirodhi kshamta tantra, sankraman kaa sthaan, beemaari ke rup main maujuud saath-saath aantarik fermakokinetic or fermacodinemic pratijaivik ke sookshm ghatak hai
 Basically, the classification of antibiotics can be such that those that take lethal or bactericidal action against bacteria, or those that are bacteriostatic, whose function is to inhibit bacterial growth
 pratijaivik dawaaon kii jeevanunashak gatividhi unke charanbaddh vikaas par nirbhar he or sabhi nahin, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main dawa kii "vinaashak" kshamta ke liye jeevanunashak pratijaivik dawaaon kii karrwai ke dauraan koshikaon ke vibhaajan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This classification is based on the behavior observed in the laboratory; In practice, both of them are capable of eradicating a bacterial infection
 pratijaivik dawaaon kii karrwai ke 'in vitro gatividhi ke lakshan kii jaankaree, gatividhi moolyankan ke liye roganurodhi kii nunatam nirodhatmak ekaagratha va roganurodhi shakti roganurodhak kshamta ke utkrisht sanketak hai
 However, in therapeutic activity, these steps alone are insufficient for predicting diagnostic outcomes
 roganurodhi gatividhi ke saath kisi pratijaivik ke fermakokinetic profil ke sangyojan dwaara kai fermacological parameter main dawa kii prabhaavashiltaa ke mahatvapurn chinh dikhte hai
 Antibiotic activity is concentration dependent and their antimicrobial activity progressively increases with antimicrobial concentrations
 ve bhi samay par aadhaarit ho sakate hai, jahaan unki roganurodhi gatividhi main vruddhi pratijaivik sandratha kii vruddhi ke saath nahin hoti, haalanki, yah bhi mahatvapurn he ki ek khaas avadhi ke liye nunatam nirodhatmak ekaagratha serum ko barkaraar rakhaa jaye
 karvis maarane ke liye upyog kiye jane vaale pratijaivik ke maarak tatwon kaa prayogshaala moolyankan karnaa samay nirdhaaran yaa ekaagratha par aadhaarit ektimicrobile gatividhi ke nirdhaaran main upyogi he
 Antibiotic drugs are usually classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical composition or spectrum of activity
 adhikansh pratijaivik bacteria ke kaary yaa unki vikaas prakriya par nishaanaa sadhate hai
 Antibiotic drugs, which focus on the bacterial cell wall or cell membrane, or essential bacterial enzymes, are generally bactericidal in nature
 ve, jo protein synthesis, jaise aminoglaicosaidas, microlides or tetraciclins par nishaanaa sadhate hai, aamtaur par bacterostatic hote hai iske alaava apane lakshya kii khaasiyat par aadhaarit vargeekaran bhi hota he: jaise "sankuchit spectrum pratijaivik" vishesh prakaar ke jeevanuon, jaise gram negative, yaa gram positive jeevanu par lakshya sadhate hai, jabaki vyapak spectrum pratijaivik jeevanuon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ko prabhavit karte hai
 In the last few years, three new classes of antibiotics have been used for diagnosis
 is tarah pratijaivik yogicon ke nae virgon kii khoj main 40 saalon kaa samay laga he
 There are the following three classes of these new antibiotics: cyclic lipopeptidases, glycylcycline, and oxazolidinones
 Tegacycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, while two others are used to treat Gram-positive infections
 in ghatnaon ko vartmaan pratijaivik dawaaon kii bacteria pratirohak pratikriya maapne ke saadhan kii ummid ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Since the first major efforts by Florey and Chan in 1939, the importance of antibiotics in medicine has led to the discovery and production of research
 utpaadan kii prakriya main saamanytah sookshmjivon kii vyapak shreniyon kaa nirikshan or unka pareekshan tathaa sanshodhan shaamil hota he
 Production is done through fermentation, usually in a strong aerobic manner
 maukhik pratijaivik ko nigalkar liya jaataa he, jabaki nason ke jariye diye jane vaale pratijaivik or zyada gambhir maamalon, jaise gaharaai tak faile pranaligat sankramanon main istemaal kiye jate hai
 Antibiotics are also sometimes used from outside, such as eye drops or ointments
 haalanki aamtaur par pratijaivik dawaaon ko surakshit or acchhee tarah sahan karne yogya mana jaataa he, par ye vyapak rup se pratikul prabhaav se bhi judi hui hai
 The side effects are many, varied and entirely dependent on the microorganisms used and targeted
 nai dawaaon se upachaar ke suraksha profile kai varshon se upyog kii ja rahi dawaaon jitne sthapit nahin he
 Adverse effects can range from fever and nausea to major allergies such as photodermatitis and anaphylics
 aam rup se dikhne vaale dushprabhavon main se ekadast he, jo kabhi-kabhi anerobics bacterium chlostridium diphisile ke kaaran hote hai or yah pratijaivik dwaara aant ke flora ke saamaanya santulan ko astavyast karne se hota he
 Such overgrowth of disease-causing bacteria can be eliminated by taking pro-biotic supplements while taking antibiotics
 pratijaivik ke kaaran un jeevanuon kii sankhya bhi bad sakati he jo saamaanya rup se yoni ke flora ke ghatak ke rup main upasthit hote hai or isse volvon-yoni kshetra main jinas candida khamir kii prajatiyon kaa jarurat se zyada vikaas ho saktaa he
 Interactivity with other drugs may also show other side effects, such as taking a quinolone antibiotic with systemic corticosteroid increases the risk of tendon damage
 anumaan kiya jaataa he ki janm niyantran goliyon kii prabhaavashiltaa ke saath kuch pratijaivik dawaaon kaa hastkshep do tareekon se hota he
 Modification of the intestinal flora may lead to decreased absorption of estrogens
 duusare, heptic liver anzime lene se goli ke sakriy tatwon kaa chayapchayan tej hota he or isse goli kii upyogita prabhavit ho sakati hai
 However, most studies indicate that antibiotics do not interfere with the work of contraception
 haalanki kuch pratishat mahilaayein pratijaivik lene ke dauraan janm niyantran goliyon ke kam prabhaav padane kii anubhuti karti hai, jabaki asafalataa kii dar kii tulanagoli lene vaali mahilaon se kii ja sakati he
 In addition, there are no other studies that show conclusively that interruption of the abdominal flora affects contraception
 antiongal dawa greesophulvin or vyapak daayre vaale pratijaivik riffampisin dwaara yakrut anzimon ke adhishthapan ke madhyam se maukhik garbhanirodhak goli lene se aisa ho saktaa he
 It is therefore recommended that during the antimicrobial therapy using these antimicrobials additional contraceptive measures should be resorted to
 sharaab pratijaivik dawaaon kii gatividhi yaa chayapchayan main dakhal de sakati he isse yakrut anzime kii gatividhi prabhavit ho sakati he, jisase pratijaivik dawaaon kaa prabhaav khatm ho jaataa he
 In addition, some of the antibiotics such as metronidazole, tinidazole, cefamandol, catechonazole, latamoxeph, cefoprazone, cephamenoxime, and furazolidin react with, causing severe side effects, including vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath
 isliye aise pratijaivik lene ke dauraan sharaab kaa seven nahin karnaa chahie
 iske atirikt, sharaab ke seven se kuch khaas paristhitiyon main doxiciclin or irithromicine susinet ke serum str main kami ho sakati he
 The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a developmental process based on the selection of the organism and thereby increasing the survival ability for doses of antibiotic drugs, which were previously fatal
 penicillin or irithromycin jaise pratijaivik, jo ek samay chamatkaari ilaaj maane jate the, ab kam prabhavakaari dikh rahe hai, kyonki jeevanu adhik pratirodhi ban rahe hai
 Antibiotics themselves act as selective pressures, which allow the growth of a certain number of resistant bacteria and then keep the easily destroyed bacteria alive
 1943 main luria-delbruk prayog ke jariye jeevanuon kii aabaadi ke bheetar pehle se maujuud pratijaivik pratirodhi utparivarti jeev kaa pradarshan kiya gaya
 Bacterial life is often the result of inherited resistance
 koi bhi pratijaivik pratirodh ek jaivik keemat maangata he or pratijaivik pratirodhi jeevanuon kaa prasar pratirodh ke saath ghati hui fitness se prabhavit ho saktaa he, jo khaskar pratijaivik ke maujuud nahin hone kii sthiti main bacteria ko jivit rakhane main laabhprad sabit hota he
 However, additional mutant organisms may help offset the cost of fitness and restore survival of these bacteria
 antarnihit aanvik pratirodh tantra, jisase pratijaivik pratirodh hota he, bhinn-bhinn ho saktaa he
 Basic resistance is natural due to the genetic design of the bacterium
 The bacterial chromosome may fail to encode the protein that the antibiotic targets
 hasil kiya hua pratirodh jeevanu gunasutra main parivartan yaa atirikt gunasutra diene ke adhigrahan se utpann hota he
 Antibiotic-producing bacteria are part of the immune system from simple to complex, similar in appearance and can migrate to antibiotic resistant strains
 pratijaivik pratirodh tantra kaa prasar kshaitij anuvanshik vinimay dwaara pichhali pidiyon or diene ke anuvanshik punarsangyojan se viraasat main mili parivartan ke sheersh sancharan ke madhyam se hota he
 Antibiotic resistance can be exchanged between different bacteria by the plasmid, which encodes antibacterial resistance, allowing multiple antibiotics to coexist
 ye plasmid vividh pratirodh tantra ke saath alag jin dhaaran kiye hue ho sakate hai or asambaddha pratijaivik se mil sakate hai, kyonki ve sthananantarit kiye gayi ek pratijaivik se zyada plasmid ekaadhik pratijaivik pratirodh paidaa karte hai
 Alternatively, mutual resistance to other antibiotics within the bacteria occurs when a similar resistance mechanism is responsible for resistance to more than one antibiotic chosen
 anupyukt pratijaivik upachaar or pratijaivik kaa ati prayog pratirodhi jeevanuon ke ubharne kaa ek mukhya kaarak hai
 The problem is further compounded when one starts taking antibiotics on their own without the instructions of a qualified physician and there is non-therapeutic use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture
 pratijaivik dawaaon main baar-baar ye sanket diye jate hai ki kahaan inaki jarurat nahin hai, yaa upyog galat he yaa diya gaya pratijaivik maamuli asar vaala he
 It also happens in some cases where the infection can be cured without treatment
 penicillin or irithromicine jaise pratijaivik, jo ek samay chamatkaarik ilaaj maane jate the, ke atiprayog se 1950 ke dashak ke baad se inke pratirohak tatv ubharne shuru ho gayi
 The therapeutic use of antibiotics in hospitals is associated with the growth of multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria
 pratijaivik ke durupyog ke aam roopon main-yatriyon dwaraprophelatic pratijaivik kaa zyada upyog, dawa likhte samay rogi ke vajan va use pehle di gayin pratijaivik dawaaon kaa dhyaan na rakhana shaamil he, kyonki donon pratijaivik dawaaon kii prabhaavashiltaa ko nasht yahaan tak ki puure course ko vifal kar sakate hai
 Antibiotics can also fail due to lack of rest for the infected organism to recover fully, not to mention the interval of taking them while writing such antibiotics
 aisa karne se pratijaivik pratirodh ke saath jeevanuon kii aabaadi badhane main madad milegi
 anupyukt pratijaivik upachaar pratijaivik durupyog kaa ek aam rup he
 As a common example, we can take the use of antibiotics that relieve viral infections for the common cold, which has no effect on it
 Wrote the same antibiotics for patients he believed, although he was suitable for only one in every 4 patients
 chikitsakon or marijon donon kaa bahukaaryakari hastkshep pratijaivik dawaaon ke anupyukt nirdhaaran ko kam kar saktaa he
 a 48-hour delay in taking antibiotics for spontaneous diagnosis of respiratory tract infections can reduce the use of antibiotics
 lekin, yah ranneeti rogi main santosh kii bhaavana kam kar sakati he
 Many organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are advocating to improve the regulatory environment
 america ke interegency roganurodhi pratirodh task force kii sthapana kaa makasad pratijaivik dawaaon ke durupyog or atiprayog se jude muddon se nipatane kaa prayaas karnaa he, jiskaa makasad roganurodhi pratirodh kii samasyaon kaa sakriyata se adhyayan karnaa he
 The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and several other government agencies coordinate these issues for consideration
 ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan abhiyaan samooh kaa naam "keep pratijaivik varking"he
 In France, a government campaign "antibiotics Are Not Automatic" has been launched since 2002, reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, especially for children
 united kingdom main, kai doctoron ke clinicon main NHS poster lagaae gaye hai, jinamein sanket kiya gaya he ki 'durbhaagya se, pratijaivik dawaaon kii kitni bhi maatra aapako cirkedi se chhutkaaraa nahin dilaa sakati, kyonki kai rogi apane doctor se khaskar anupyukt pratijaivik dene kaa anurodh karte he, is vishwaas se unhen viral sankraman ke ilaaj main madad milegi
 In agriculture, antibiotic resistance associated with the non-clinical treatment of antibiotics as growth-sponsors in animals began in the post-1970 restricted form in the UK
 vartmaan main puure europea sangh main vikaas praayojakon ke rup main pratijaivik dawaaon ke gaiyr-nidanmoolak upyog par pabandi lagi he
 It is estimated that more than 70% of the antibiotics used in the US are fed to animals without causing disease
 khaadya pashu utpaadan main pratijaivik ke upyog salmonella spp, capilobacter esapeepi, esacherichia kolai or introcucus esapeepi sahit jeevanuon ke pratirodhi prakaaron se judaa hua he
 Some American evidence and European studies indicate that these resistant bacteria cause infections in humans, which do not respond to commonly prescribed antibiotics
 In relation to these customs and associated problems, many organizations, such as the need to ban the use of antibiotics in the production of edible animals and to eliminate all non-medical use of it
 haalanki, pratijaivik dawaaon ke upyog ko simit karne ke liye viniamak or vidhaayi karrwai main deree aam he or isamen in pratijaivik kaa upyog kar rahe yaa bech rahe udyogon kaa virodh or saath-saath pratijaivik ke upyog or vishaanujanit laailaaj bimariyon ke bich aakasmik sampark banane se sambandhit anusandhan main lage udyogon kaa virodh bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Public health and medical organizations, including two federal bills, supported
 europea sangh ne 2003 ke baad se vikaas sanwarddhak agent ke rup main pratijaivik dawaaon ke istemaal par pratibandh laga diya he
 Research is currently being conducted on a solution for the development of drug compounds that can withstand resistance, which can reverse many antibiotic resistance
 ye tathakthith pratirodh ko sanshodhit karne vaale agent MDR tantra ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai or unhen baadhit kar sakate hai, jisase bacteria pratijaivik dawaaon se aakraant ho sakate hai, jo pehle se hi pratirodhi ke rup main maujuud the
 These compounds can target the following including others- yogicon kii pahchaan ke tulanaatmak adhyayan, jo surakshit rup se bacteria kaa sankraman thik karata he, kavak or viral sankraman ke upachaar main nakli kii pahchaan karnaa mushkil tha
 Antibiotic research led to considerable progress in the field of knowledge of biochemistry and this led to major differences between the cellular and molecular physiology of a bacterial cell, and this was the case with the mammalian cell
 This explained the opinion that many compounds that may be toxic to bacteria are non-toxic to human cells
 iske vipareet, kavak prakoshth ke buniyadi jaev rasayan or stanpayi cell kaaphi kuch milte-julate hai
 It focuses on the development and application of therapeutic compounds to attack the fungal cell, while not harming mammalian cells
 Similar problems appear in antibiotic treatment of viral diseases
 maanav viral chayapachay jaev rasayan maanav jaev rasayan ke bahut samaan he or ativeiral yogicon ke sambhavit nishane bahut kuch ek standhari virus ke liye adwitiya ghatak tak hi simit rah jate hai

 bahu-aushadhi pratirodhi jeevon kaa matlab aam taur par us bacteria se nikaala jaataa he, jo clasical pratijaivik dawaaon kii naidanik khuraaq, jinhen haal hi main unke nidaan ke liye liya gaya ho, ko prabhavit nahin kar rahe hai
 The growth of these organisms has created a need for alternative antibacterial treatment
 phej chikitsa, jiske tahat bacteria par hamale ke liye khaas tarah ke virason kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, 1920 or 1930 ke dashak ke dauraan america, pashchimi or purvi europe main upyog main thi
 Phages are a common organ of bacteria born in the surrounding ecology, which greatly controls the population of bacteria in the gut, ocean, soil and other environments
 in upachaaron kii safalataa kaaphi had tak anumaan yaa kalpana par aadhaarit yaa kharaab tareeke se niyantrit he
 "bacteriocins" are also a growing alternative to classic small molecule antibiotics
 bacteriosins ke vibhinn virgon ke chikitsakeey agent ke rup main vibhinn tarah kii sambhaavnaaen hai
 Small molecule bacteriocins can be similar to classic antibiotics; Like colicin, there is a possibility of a more narrow spectrum of bacteriocins, which would lead to the demand for new molecular diagnostics prior to therapy and would increase the likelihood of resistance at the same level
 One drawback of large molecule antibiotics is the relative difficulty for them to cross the membrane and travel systemically throughout the body
 poshak tatwon kii vaapasi pratijaivik ko badalane yaa unka poorak vikalp taiyaar karne kii ek sambhavit ranneeti ho sakati he
 Restrictions on the availability of iron are one way in which the human body can limit bacterial proliferation
 sharir ko louh mukt karne kaa tantra rogajanakon ke bich aam he
 These dynamic, different research groups are attempting to produce new types of researchers that will pull back the iron element, otherwise these pathogens will become available to bacteria, fungi and parasites
 It differs from chelation therapy in conditions different from bacterial infections, including successful treatment of excessive iron content
 MDRO sankramanon ke mukaable ke liye aam taur par tike kaa suzav diya jaataa he
 They actually fit within a larger class of therapies, which rely on immune modulation or enhancement
 ye chikitsa pranaliyaan sankramit yaa sambhavit mejabaan kii prakritik pratirohak kshamta ko jagaati hai yaa majboot banaati hai, jisase macrophesso, antibody kaa nirmaan, sujan, yaa anya clasik pratiraksha pratikriya jaisi gatividhiyaan dikhti hai
 Because, macrophages consume bacteria and they are absorbed, various forms of biotherapy are suggested, which prepare the organism to pass on the pathogens
 isamen protojoa kii tainaati or maget rapy shaamil hai
 Probiotic is another option, which transcends traditional antibiotics by producing a live culture, which in theory proves itself to be a sciambiant, competitive, inhibiting, inhabiting or simply interfering with the colonization of pathogens

 The criteria of the World Health Organization are: Z- score umr-milan saamaanya se tulana hota he or aamtaur par gambhir osteoporosis ke maamalon main iskaa istemaal hota he
 This is the number of standard deviations a patient's BMD differs from the mean BMD of their age, sex, and ethnicity

 Nandita Morarji or Namrata Sadana, popularly known as Nagma, Hindi: Naghmatamil: நக்மா, is an Indian actress from Bollywood, Tollywood and Kollywood
 1990 ke dashak main apane charam par, da hindu akhbaar ke uddharnanusaar, "tamil cinema par unka prabhutv" tha
 He was born on Christmas Day to a Muslim mother and Hindu father
 unhone bollywood main apana abhinay kareer shuru kiya or kuch filmon main abhinay kiya, lekin dakshin main sthanantarit ho gayi, jahaan unki mumbai vaapasi se pehle tak, unhen beshumaar safalataa mili
 Although she is sometimes listed as Nagma in the film titles, she is not considered an older actress who adopted the same stage name - this mistake is made on her list on the Internet Movie Database website
 nagma hindi, telugu, tamil, kannada, malayalam, bengali, bhojpuri, punjabi or ab marathi jaisi bhartiya bhashaaon main vistrut rup se kaam karne ke liye ullekhneey rahi hai
 Nagma's biological father is the late Mr
 Arvind Pratapsin Morarji of the textile-world
 Her mother is Seema Sadana, who married Morarji in 1972, but only broke up "a few years later", as the Telegraph reported in 2006, when Nagma revealed it publicly
 nagma ke passport ke anusaar, unako janm ke samay nandita naam diya gaya tha, or isi naam se ve parivaar dwaara mudrit smritilekh main nirdisht kii gai thim, jab unke pita arvind morarji kaa nidhan hua
 After divorcing Morarji "due to some family problems", Nagma's mother later married filmmaker Chander Sadana, who had two more daughters, Jyothika and Radhika, who have acted in a Tamil film as well There was a son named Suraj
 apane jaivik pita se, jinhone baad main dubaara shaadi kii, nagma ke do sautele bhai hai, dhanraj or yuvaraj
 Nagma was close to her biological father, until she died on 1 January 2006
 unhone ek mumbai reporter ko spasht kiya: "mujhe is tathy par garv he ki meraa rishta sammanit dharamsingh morarji parivaar se he
 My mother legally married Arvind Morarji in a public ceremony at the Radio Club in Colaba
 " nagma kii maa ne hi unhen abhinetri banane ke liye protsaahit kiya or kehete hai ki kai saal tak "filmi seton par unke saath raheen"
 vastra udyog main apane pita kii prishthbhumi kii ore rujhaan dikhaate hue, ab mumbai ke hill road par nagma kii khud kii nagamaas naamak vastron kii ek dukaan he, jiskaa sitambar 2003 main akshay kumaar ne udghaatan kiya tha
 Nagma told mid-day in 2006 "I am not bent on getting married
 


 You should not get married unless you have full confidence in your partner
 


 Marriage is an institution in which i would like to join, but only when i find the right person
 " nagma ko 1990 kii salmaan khan ke saath abhinit apni pehali hit film Baaghi: a Rebel for Love se kaafii safalataa mili, us samay ve 16 saal kii thim
 Along with Karisma Kapoor, she was also among the leading heroines of Suhag in 1994, starring Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgan
 is aarambhik safalataa ke baavjood, apni saheli divya bharti ke kehane par ve telugu or tamil filmon main kaam karne ke liye dakshin bharat chali gayi
 Explaining his transfer to the south later, he not only mentioned the high quality of work there, but said "I did what was better then! i was a Muslim girl and the Shiv Sena was slowly turning its head at that time
" Was picking ve dakshin main ek badi star ban gayi or 1990 dashak ke adhikansh samay main, kam se kam 1997 tak, chotii par bani raheen or kathith taur par tamilnadu main prashansakon ne unako ek mandir samarpit kiya
 His major hits in Telugu include Gharana Mogudu with Chiranjeevi in 1993, Allari Alludu and N
 with Akkineni Nagarjuna
 Major Chandrakant with T
 Ramrao and Mohan Babu
 His main Tamil hit films were Baasha with superstar Rajinikanth in 1995 and Kadlan with Prabhu Deva in 1994
 Most of his performances during this period were glamor oriented
 mumbai waapas lautne ke baad, 2001 main unhone ek saakshaatkaarkarta se kaha tha ki "tamil cinema main chotii kii abhinetri bane rahane kaa dabaav main sambhaal nahin paa rahi thi
 i was unhappy with the kind of films i was working on
 jis tarah kaa kaam main karnaa chaahati thi, vah main isliye kar nahin paa rahi thi, kyonki mujhe ek vyast abhinetri ke rup main darshakon kii apekshaaon ke anuroop hi kaam karnaa padataa tha
 i was tied up, so i decided to take a break
 phir se bollywood main rahete hue, unhone badi hit filmon main sahaayak bhoomikaaon par dhyaan kendrit kiya, jaise ki 2000 kii chal mere bhai, jisamen ve dubaara karishma kapur, salmaan khan or sanjay dutt jaise apane purv sahyogi kalakaaron ke saath judin
 ek saal ke bheetar, nagma ne aadhyatm-unmukh art of living paathyakram main daalila liya, antat khud hi mumbai or anya sthanon main padhaane lageen
 mumbai main rahete samay, unhone kuch telugu or tamil filmon main kaam karnaa jari rakhaa, jaise allari ramudu or citizan, jinamein mahatvapurn sahaayak bhoomikaayen nibhaane ke saath hi saath, kuch malayalam filmon main mukhya bhoomikaayen bhi nibhaain
 Nagma "was a prominent campaigner for the Congress party

 Dance in India has its roots in ancient traditions
 is vishaal upmahadweep main nrityon kii vibhinn vidhaon ne janm liya he
 Each genre is shaped by the influence of specific times and environments
 raashtra shastreey nrity kii kai vidhaon ko pesh karata he, jinamein se prayek kaa sambandh desh ke vibhinn bhaagon se he
 Each genre represents the ethos of a particular area or group of people
 bharat ke kuch prasiddh shastreey nrity hai - Special features of this dance form are the Padams or poems based on the hero-heroine theme
 bharat natyam, bharat ke prasiddh nrityon main se ek he tathaa iskaa sambandh dakshin bharat ke tamilnadu rajya se he
 The name is derived from the word "bharata" and is related to dance
 aisa mana jaataa he ki brahma, hindu devkul ke mahaan tridevon main se pratham, natya shaastra athwa nrity vigyaan hai
 Brahma was so impressed by the persuasion of Indra and other gods of heaven that he used the four Vedas to create the dance Vedas
 natya veda athwa pancham veda, bharat va uske anuyaayiyon ko pradaan kiya gaya jinhone is vidya kaa parichay prithvi ke nashwar manushyon ko diya
 Hence its name was Bharata Natyam
 bharat natyam main nrity ke teen moolbhoot tatwon ko kushaltapurvak shaamil kiya gaya he
 These are Bhava or state of mind, raga or music and melody and rhythm or kaal samajana
 bharat natyam kii takanic main, haath, pair, mukh, va sharir sanchaalan ke samanvayan ke 64 siddhant hai, jinka nishpaadan nrity paathyakram ke saath kiya jaataa he
 Bharata Natyam has three basic elements of life - philosophy, religion and science
 yah ek gatisheel va sansaarik nrity style he, tathaa isaki pracheenta swayan siddh he
 It is perfectly compatible to be seen as a symbol of beauty and beauty
 vastut: yah ek aisi parampara he, jisamen purna samarpan, sansaarik bandhanon se virakti tathaa nishpadankarta kaa isamen charmotkarsh par hona aavashyak he
 Bharata Natyam is a comparatively new name
 pehle ise sadir, daasi attam or tanjavurnatyam ke naamon se janaa jaataa tha
 Some of the prominent artists of Bharatanatyam - Leela Samson, Mrinalini Sarabhai, Baijayantimala Bali, Malavika Sarkar, Yamini Krishnamurthy, Padma Subrahmanyam, Sonal Man Singh, Rukmini Devi Arundel etc
 kerala ke dakshin - pashchimi rajya kaa ek samrudh or phalne phoolne vaala nrity kathakali yahaan kii parampara he
 Kathakali means a story drama or a dance drama
 katha kaa arth he kahani, yahaan abhinayta ramayana or mahabharat ke mahagranthon or puraanon se liye gaye charitron ko abhinay karte hai
 This is a very colorful dance
 iske nartak ubhare hue paridhaanon, phooldaar dupatton, aabhushanon or mukut se saje hote hai
 They take a form of symbolic characterization to portray various roles that are closer to the character than to the individual character
 vibhinn visheshtaayen, maanav, devtaa samaan, daitya aadi ko shandaar veshbhusha or paridhaanon ke madhyam se pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 The most impressive part of this dance is that its characters never speak, only the highly developed language of their hand gestures and the expression of the face that displays the text of this play to the audience
 unke chehre ke chote or bade haav bhav, bhanvon kii gati, netron kaa sanchalan, gaalon, naak or thodi kii abhivyakti par baariki se kaam kiya jaataa he tathaa ek kathakali abhinayta - nartak dwaara vibhinn bhaawanaaon ko prakat kiya jaataa he

 vartmaan samay kaa kathakali ek nrity naatika kii parampara he jo kerala ke natya karm kii ucch vishisht style kii parampara ke saath shatabdiyon pehle viksit hua tha, vishesh rup se kudiattem
 Traditional customs such as Theyam, Mudiyattam and the martial arts of Kerala play an important role in bringing the dance to its present form
 kathak kaa nrity rup 100 se adhik ghunghruon ko pairon main baandh kar talbaddh padchaap, vihangam chakkar dwaara pahachaanaa jaataa he or hindu dharmik kathaon ke alaava persian or urdu kavita se lee gai vishyavastuon kaa naatakeey prastutikaran kiya jaataa he
 Kathak was born in the north, but with Persian and Muslim influence, it reached the temple's way of court entertainment
 kathak kii style kaa janm brahman pujaariyon dwaara hinduon kii parmparik pun: gananaa main nihit he, jinhen cathik kehete the, jo naatakeey andaaj main haav bhaavon kaa upyog karte the
 In this, the style of storytelling developed more and became a dance form
 uttar bharat main mughalon ke aane par is nrity ko shahi darbar main le jaaya gaya or iskaa vikaas e parishkrut kalaroop main hua, jise mughal shaskaon kaa sangrakshan praapt tha or kathak ne vartmaan swaroop liya
 Now in this dance, more emphasis was placed on aesthetic sense than religion
 shabd kathak kaa udbhav katha se hua he, jiskaa shabdic arth he kahani kahana
 In olden times, storytellers used to speak it as songs and dance to give their narrative a new look
 isse katha kalakshepam or dakshin bharat main hari katha kaa rup bana or yahi uttar bharat main kathak ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Around the 15th century, this dance tradition underwent a major transformation due to Mughal dance and music
 16veen shatabdi ke ant tak kase hue chudeedaar pyjame ko kathak nrity kii veshbhusha maan liya gaya
 There are two major gharanas of this dance tradition, both of which are named after cities in North India and both of them expanded under the patronage of the regional kings - Lucknow Gharana and Jaipur Gharana
 odisi ko puratathvik saakshyon ke aadhaar par sabase puraane jivit nrity roopon main se ek mana jaataa he
 The traditional dance of Odisha, Odissi originated from the dance of the devadasis who danced in the temple
 odisi nrity kaa ullekh shila lekhon main miltaa he, ise brahmeshwar mandir ke shila lekhon main darshaya gaya he saath hi konark ke surya mandir ke kendriya kaksh main iskaa ullekh miltaa he
 This entire dance form was given a facelift in the year 1950, thanks to the acting Chandrika and the postures of the carved dances found in the temples
 kisi anya bhartiya shastreey nrity rup ke samaan odisi ke do pramukh paksh hai: nrity yaa gaiyr nirupan nrity, jahaan antariksh or samay main sharir kii bhangimaaon kaa upyog karte hue sajaavati pattern srujit kiye jate hai
 Another form of this is Abhinaya, which is used to explain the story or theme to the gestures and facial expressions of the symbolic hand
 isamen tribhang par dhyaan kendrit kiya jaataa he, jiskaa arth he sharir ko teen bhaagon main baantnaa, sir, sharir or pair; mudraaen or abhivyaktiyaan bharat natyam ke samaan hoti he
 Odissi dance tells stories about Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu
 yah ek komal, kavitamay shastri nrity he jisamen urisa ke parivesh tathaa iske sarvaadhik lokapriy devtaa, bhagwaan jagannatha kii mahima kaa gaan kiya jaataa he
 The classical dance form from the Manipur region of the Northeast is the Manipuri dance
 manipuri nrity bharat ke anya nrity roopon se bhinn he
 In this, the body moves at a slow pace, the arms flow to the fingers with symbolic splendor and adorable speed
 yah nrity rup 18veen shatabdi main vaishnav sampradaay ke saath viksit hua jo iske shuruuaati reeti rivaaj or jaadui nrity roopon main se bana he
 Themes from the compositions of Vishnu Purana, Bhagavata Purana and Geetgovind are mainly used in it
 manipur kii metai janajati kii dantakthaon ke anusaar jab ishwar ne prithvi kaa srijan kiya tab yah ek pind ke samaan thi
 Seven lanurahs danced on this newly formed hemisphere, pressing it softly with their feet to make it strong and smooth
 yah metai jaagoi kaa udbhav he
 To this day, when the Manipuri people dance, they do not move fast, but place their feet on the ground with tenderness and softness
 mul bhranti or kahaniyaan abhi bhi metai ke pujaariyon yaa mibis dwaara mibi ke rup main sunai jaati hai jo manipuri kii jad hai
 The female "raas" dance is based on the theme of radha-krishna, which is a form of belle and solo dance
 purush "sankirthan" nrity manipuri dholak kii taal par puri shakti ke saath kiya jaataa he
 Mohiniyattam is a semi-classical dance performed by women in Kerala, which is believed to be older than Kathakali
 saahitiyik rup se nrity ke bich mukhya mana jane vaala jaadui mohiniatatm kerala ke mandiron main pramukhat: kiya jaataa tha
 It is also believed to be the successor of the Devadasi dance heritage such as Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi and ODC
 is shabd mohini kaa arth he ek aisi mahila jo dekhne waalon kaa man moh len yaa unamem ichha utpann karen
 It is a well-known story of Lord Vishnu when he took the form of a siren to attract people during the churning of the ocean of milk and the story of the destruction of Bhamasura is associated with it
 at: yah sochaa gaya he ki vaishnav bhakton ne is nrity rup ko mohiniatatm kaa naam diya

 19veen shatabdi main swati thirunal, purv travana kor ke raja the, jinhone is kala rup ko protsaahan or sthirikaran dene ke liye kaaphi prayaas kiye
 However, this art form declined in the post-swati era

 soviet sangh, 25 disambar 1991 ko vighatit ghoshit hua
 In this declaration the former republics of the Soviet Union were considered independent
 vighatan ke purv mikhail gorvachev, soviet sangh ke raashtrapati the
 He had stepped down the day before the announcement of dissolution
 vighatan kii is prakriya armbh aam taur par gorvachev ke satta grahan karne ke saath joda jaataa he
 In fact, the process of disintegration of the Soviet Union had begun long before
 soviet sangh ke nipaat ke anek buniyadi evam aitihaasik kaaran hai jo satahi najar daalane par nahin dikhte
 The Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 gave birth to a new communist state called the Soviet Union
 isi ke saath soviet sangh ne aarambh main hi spasht kar diya ki raajnneetik vyavastha or samyavaadee sanghathan samaajawaadee vichaardhaara par ashrith hoge tathaa samyavaadee marxvaadi vishwa darshan hi rashtrahit ko paribhaashit karne kii ek maatr kasuti hoga
 It was but natural that the capitalist western states considered this revolutionary communist state as their inborn enemy
 1920 evam 30 ke dashak main lenin kii mrityu ke baad stallin ne apane ko sarvocch netaa ke rup main sthapit kiya or us desh main samyavaadee paati kii taanaashaahee sthapit ho gai
 Stalin brutally eliminated and suppressed his opponents
 is kaaran soviet sangh kii pahchaan janatantr kaa hanan karne vaale ek rajya ke rup main hone lagi
 Even after the death of Stalin, dictatorial tendencies continued to exist under the rule of Khushchev and Brezhnev
 naagarik swatantraaa, prashasan, videsh yatra aadi par pratibandh jari rahe
 In a way "iron curtains" were put on the folk spirit
 'sarvhaara ke adhinaayakatv' kaa arth hi thi ki satta sarvhaara varg ke haath main ho
 The essence of socialist democracy was to guarantee the basic rights of the toiling masses and to ensure their participation in the formulation of state policies
 soviet union ne is prajatantr kii sthapana kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 As a result, the "dictatorship of the proletariat" turned into the dictatorship of the leaders occupying the proletariat at the top positions in the state and the party
 janata rajya tathaa vyavastha ke prati udasin ho gai
 His indifference and resentment reached such a limit that when the system was abolished, no one voice was heard from any part of the public in his defense
 rus na keval bhugolic drushti se duniya kaa sabase bada rajya tha balki uski aabaadi adbhut vividhta jhalkaane vaali bahurashtriya thi
 The Russian jars made no effort to subdue this vast empire under central administration, but the Soviet Communist Party attempted to centralize and this ethnic diversity remained a threat to the national unity and integrity of the Soviet Union
 soviet samyavaadee party is uljhi gutthi kaa samaadhan dhundne main asamarth rahi
 The propagation of Western powers during the Cold War years made this challenge explosive
 soviet samrajya ne jin purvi deshon ko apane prabhaav main laayaa tha, jaise- hungary, poland, checkoslovakia, romania, aadi un sabhi jagahon main swadhinata kii lalak soviet samrajya ke liye chintaa kaa vishay bana rahaa
 The option of economic development and social restructuring put forward by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union did not prove very successful
 tratski jaise aalochakon ne to bahut pehle hi stallin kii niti ko samaajwaad se vishwasghaat ke rup main prachaarit kiya tha or aage khurshchev ne bhi stallin or stallin vaad kii ninda kii
 It was during this Khurshchev regime that Maoist China also began to stigmatize that the Soviet Union was no longer a communist revolutionary state, but a reformist, regressive, opportunistic compromising force
 is tarah soviet netritv apane sahyogi duusare samyavaadee deshon kaa vishwaas ganvaa chukaa tha
 His national interest was beginning to be seen as giving preference to collective, national and revolutionary interests
 soviet-china vivaad ho yaa purvi europe ke samyavaadee deshon main asantosh, in sabakaa nateeja soviet samyavaadiyon ko kamjor karne vaala hi siddh hua
 The top leadership of the Communist Party was also responsible to a extent for the disintegration of the Soviet Union
 soviet sangh main party tathaa rajya ke bich koi bhed na rahane ke kaaran party tathaa rajya kaa netritv unheen ke haathon main tha
 This party leadership was infamous for its accommodative life, nepotism and corrupt conduct
 faltah soviet netaa janata ke liye apane adarsh rup ko kho chuke the
 As far as economic development is concerned, even though Soviet achievements in military and strategic fields were equal to and sometimes higher than the Americans, this achievement greatly reduced the economic growth rate of the Soviet Union
 vastutah antarit anusandhan kii pratispardhaa, shastr-nirmaan par betahasha kharch tathaa apni prabhutaa banaae rakhane ke liye anya deshon kii aantarik samasyaon main hastkshep karne se soviet sangh kii arthvyavastha ladkadaane lagi
 Not only this, it was the moral responsibility of the Soviet Union to provide economic and military and political help to the socialist states that were established in Eastern Europe
 saath hi navaswatantra deshon kii arthvyavasthaaon ko aarthik sahaayta pradaan karnaa bhi uski niti rahi, taaki ve america kheme main jane se bache rahe
 Due to all these reasons, the economic condition of the Soviet Union fell
 soviet sangh ke 1970-85 kii avadhi main vruddhi dar main 10% kii giravat hui
 The share of exports of equipment and equipment decreased
 krishi utpaadan, audyogic utpaadan main kami ai
 As a result, long lines were started for consumer goods, the standard of living of the citizens declined
 is tarah aam upabhokta ke liye abhaav hi aam baat thi
 During the Cold War, the emphasis of Western propaganda was to prove that the communist system had failed in both production and distribution
 abhaav ke is maahaul main upabhoktaaon ke bade asantosh ke saath-saath abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke abhaav main or maanavdhikaron ke ulanghan ne soviet vyavastha ko or kshtdaayi bana diya tha
 The ambition of equalization of nuclear weapons with the US put an enormous burden on the Soviet Union's economy
 raashtrapati reagan ke samay ghoshit star vars pariyojna ko prabhaavaheen banane ke liye soviet sangh ko apane raksha bajet main betahasha vruddhi kerani padi
 At the same time, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan
 is hastkshep ne na keval us par aarthik boj daalaa balki alokapriy bhi banaaya
 This left the Soviet Union completely alone in the international fraternity
 isi samay purvi europe main samyavaadee soviet samrajya ko chunauti dene vaali parivartankami halchal shuru ho gai
 In Poland, a military organization called "solidatory" was showing a militant attitude against the country's communist party, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to support the corrupt regime of Chechenscue in Romania
 mikhail gorbachob ne in piristhatiyon main santta sanbhali
 On 11 March 1985, Gorbachev assumed the leadership of the Soviet Union, and with this began a new chapter in Soviet communist history
 gorbachov ne rus kii aarthik dasha main sudhaar hetu tathaa samyawad ko sakaaratmak drushti se majboot banane ke liye apni vishisht nitiyon kii ghoshan kii jise uskorani perestroika or glasnost ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Gorbachev's aim was to bring about radical changes in the Soviet system through these concepts
 uski koshish samyawad main naveen parivartan laakar aadhaar pradaan karne kii tha
 For this reason, the changes brought by him are considered to mark the arrival of the Second Soviet Revolution
 gorbachov ke anusaar tatkaaleen soviet arthvyavastha ghatiya vastuon, akushalta tathaa pratidwandvita ke abhaav se grasit he
 There was a difference between the goods and services presented to the people and the goods and services they demanded
 is tarah yah mana gaya ki uskorani arthvyavastha ke dhaanche ko is prakaar parivertin karegaa ki logon kii aavashyaktaaon kii santushti adhik gatisheel, kushal va samajonmukh ho
 Under this, instead of using more resources, there was talk of increasing efficiency by increasing efficiency
 perestroika kaa arth he- punargathan yaa punarsarachna iske madhyam se samaaj me aise sudhaar laane kaa sankalp liya jisase puraani kathorataaon kaa ant karke manushya ke aarthik, saamaajik, raajnneetik, saanskrithik va atmik vikaas kaa maarg prashastr kiya ja sake
 Thus it was a process of moving towards a new society
 perestroika ke antargat nimnlikhit bate shaamil he- Accelerating socio-economic progress
 samaaj kaa vyapak loktantrikaran karnaa
 Democratize decentralization
 vyakti kaa naitik va aadhyatmik vikaas karnaa
 Expose the distortions of society
 is tarah perestroika kaa uddeshy ek aise samaaj kaa vistaar karnaa tha jahaan maanav kii garima or gaurav kendra main ho, maanviya mulyon kii pratishtha ho
 Gorbachev encouraged private farming through reforms, leases and contracts under the Perestroika
 krishi main sahakaari sanghathan ko samuhik sanghathan kii tulana main adhik mahatv diya kyonki isamen vyakti kii kaam karne kii prerana bani rahati he
 Similarly, consumer industries were developed, wages and salaries were linked to productivity and work skilled workers were provided more salaries and facilities
 isi tarah praudyogiki evam nivesh sambandhi niti main parivartan laakar arthvyavastha ke gahan sanrachanaatmak punargathan kaa prayaas kiya
 Tried to move the economy on a path of stagnant and rapid growth, by stagnating it
 perestroika ke madhyam se gorbachov soviet sangh ko nae samaaj kii ore le janaa chaahate the
 He wanted to rebuild this new society on the basis of Lenin's ideology
 in nitiyon kaa yathasthitivaadiyon dwaara vyapak virodh kiya gaya
 Glasnost means 'openness'
 glasnost ke tahat khuli bahes ko protsaahan diya gaya jisase loktantr kii shaktiyaan sudruth ho
 Gorbachev stressed that Glasnost should be expanded in planning and administration in all functions and open debate on territorial, economic, ethnic, youth related, environmental social and other problems in the country so as to ensure people's right May the opinion be known
 gorbachov ne kaha bhi ki hamen glasnost kii usee prakaar aavashyaktaa he jaise hawa kaa
 Socialism was to follow the path of democracy through Glassnost
 vastutah perestroika kii vyapak avadharana ke tahat jis saamaajik, aarthik, raajnneetik roopantaran kii baat kii gai or ek aise samaaj kii punarsarachna kaa prayaas kiya gaya jisamen logon kii bhaagedari is roopantaran main ho, uske liye jaruri tha glasnosat arthath khulaapan
 For this reason, it was said that without Glassnot, there is no Perestroika and no democracy
 glasnost kii prakriya vastutah chunauti bhari thi kyonki bandhe samaaj ko khule main rahane kii aadat nahin thi
 1
 Glasnost and Perestroika became not only words but symbols of change
 soviet samaaj ke har mode par parivartan aane laga,rajnatik kaidiyon ko reeha kaa diya gaya
 2
 Open debate started in the country
 bahudaleey chunaav kaa nayaa anubhav soviet janata ko praapt hua
 3
 Soviet citizens were allowed foreign travel and civil immigration
 4
 videsh niti main parivartan laayaa gaya or sheet yuddh ke sthaan par tanaav shithily ko mahatv diya gaya
 5
 Soviet society was relieved of rigid discipline and iron cover policy through reform programs
 6
 is khuli bahes kaa soviet sangh main durupyog bhi hua log iske madhyam se gutbaji or sankeern swaarthon kii purti main lag gaye
 During this time the republics demanded more autonomy
 jinakon milakar soviet sangh bana tha
 Some republics wanted to be completely independent
 7
 janatantric tatwon tathaa kattarpanthi samyavaadiyon ke bich rassakashi main prashasan niskriy ho gaya
 Separatism erupted into violence, with the Soviet Union reaching the brink of anarchy
 agast 1991main kuch communist netaaon ne takhta palatney kaa asafal prayaas kiya
 As a result, the process of disintegration of the Soviet Union was accelerated
 or antat vah bikhar gaya
 Gorbachev resigned
 or soviet sangh ke sthaan par 15 swatantra ganraajya kaa disambar 1991 main janm hua
 As far as the Gobachyov and his policies resulted in the Soviet Union's formation, it can be said that his policies completed the process of disintegration of the Soviet Union
 uski niti ke kaaran soviet sangh kii kendriya satta kamjor ho gai, falswaroop soviet sangh main kendra ke viruddh sangharsh karne vaali shaktiyon ke hausale badhate gaye
 Gorbachev's so-called democratic policies recognized the republics' separation from the Soviet Union
 falswaroop dekhte hi dekhte ek ke baad ek karke soviet sangh ke ganraajya swatantra ho gaye or soviet sangh kaa vighatan ho gaya
 It was a result of Gorbachev's policies that the power of the Soviet communist party continued to decline
 faltah soviet sangh kii ekta ke sutara main baandhane vaale sabase bade sampark sutara kii shakti hi ghatati gai
 The result was to raise the head of the anti-communist forces
 america or paashchaatya deshon kaa bhi soviet sangh ko todanevaali in shaktiyon ko samarthan praapt tha
 As a result, these powers undermined the unity of the Soviet Union
 gorbachov ne purvi europe main bhi samyawad ke durg ko dhahne se rokane kii disha main koi prayaas nahin kiya, ulte uski nitiyon ke kaaran purvi europe main samyawad virdohi shaktiyaan haaavee hoti gai
 Communism collapsed in Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, East Germany, and the collapse destroyed the image of the Soviet Union's superpower
 yah kahana aasaan he ki soviet sangh kaa patan or avsaan kii jimmedaari sirp gorbachov kii he
 To do so would be a mistake to consider one person important from historical trends
 gorbachov to in aitihaasik pravritiyon ko pratibimbat karne vaale darpan maatr the jo khud tut-kar bikhar gaye
 In fact, the Soviet Union was sown in the midst of its disintegration
 samaajawaadee vyavastha ko jivit rakhane ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki desh main samaajawaadee manushya va samskruti ko paidaa kiya jaae, soviet vyavastha aisa karne main vifal rahi
 For nearly two decades under Stalin's rule, the unity of the Soviet Union was sustained by the central government's ruthless discipline
 desh ke vibhinn hisson ko samyawad kii raksha ke liye rashtrahit main yaa antarrashtriya bhaichaare ke bahaane qurbaani dene ke liye majaboor hona padataa tha aisa nahin tha ki asantosh yaa aakrosh paidaa hi nahin hote the sirp damankaaree nitiyon ke kaaran inaki mukhar abhivyakti kathin thi
 Gorbachev's liberal policies provided a way to express this outrage
