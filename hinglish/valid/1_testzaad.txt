 They reside on the site and the sides develop externally
 ninf se purna keet tak kii vruddhi kramik hoti he or pupa nahin banataa he
 The incomplete transformation of this type of transformation and the insect community is called hemimetabola, such as a reed petal
 dimbh us apraudh avasthaa ke keet se bahut bhinn hota he
 No external sign of the sides is found in it
 dimbh ko purna keet banane se pehle pupa bananaa padataa he
 This type of change is called complete conversion, such as in a domestic fly

 There are four types of ovum, protopods are found in the GV appendages on the ovum, because their eggs have a small amount of yoke
 ye dimbh lagbhag bhruneey avasthaa main hi hote hai
 It is possible to survive because they live either in the eggs of other insects or within their bodies, where they get highly nutritious food to grow
 inke udar main khand yaa kisi prakaar ke avyav nahin paae jate hai
 Polypods or erusiform columns also have clear segments in the body and components on the abdomen
 shringikas or vidyaman hoti hai, kintu choti hoti hai
 They live near their food and are lazy for this reason

 Can compare it to the sound emanating from Bella
 duusari vidhi main keet kii peshiyon kaa sankochan vimochan hota he
 These muscles are attached to the membrane and hence the membrane also vibrates
 is prakaar se dhwani utpann karne kaa manushya ke paas koi saadhan nahin he
 Jhingur, katydid, grasshopper and cicada are members of the famous choir of insects
 jheengur, katedid or tidde ek hi gana ke antargat aate hai
 On one front side of the beetles and catechids, there is a plank similar to the sand, which rubs the part of the other forearm which becomes thicker towards the edge

 The life of a large number of insects depends on flora
 lagbhag prayek prakaar kaa paudha or uskaa prayek bhaag kisi na kisi jati ke keet kaa bhojan ban jaataa he
 It is estimated that about fifty percent of insects do their subsistence from plants
 tiddiyaan or tidde khule main rahakar lagbhag prayek paudha kha jate hai
 Many species of moths, ovaries, saucers and thorns also eat almost every part of the plant, either in the open or hiding it
 ye pattey, stambh, jad tathaa kashtha ke bheetar rahakar bhi apana bhojan paa jaati hai
 Jhalaripaksha, Drumayuka and other makuna of plants suck the juice by piercing it

 Each plant nurtures many species of insects
 do sau jati ke keet makai par, chaar sau jati ke seb par tathaa ek sau pachaas se adhik jatiyon ke keet chid ke vriksh par nirvaah karte paae gaye hai
 Often, insects of different species are found on different parts of the tree and thus to some extent remain from competition
 bahut se keet apana purna jivan ek hi paudhe par vyateet karte hai
 Insects that live inside the leaves, holes inside the plants, and insect-forming insects live their lives in this way
 inkaa paudhon main pravesh karnaa paudhe kii vishesh dasha par nirbhar rahata he
 Many pests attack many plants, or plants of several species of the same class
 saadharantaya prayek jati ke keet kaa paudha nirdhaarit rahata he, tathaa anek keet nirdhaarit jati ke paudhon ke atirikt kisi anya paudhe ko nahin khate, chaahe unki mrityu bhale hi ho jaae
 Many pests and plants are interrelated
 aise keet paraag or makrand praapt karne ke liye pushpon par jate hai
 While receiving these items, they wreath in ignorance
 pushpon se bhojan praapt karne vaale kiton main praaia: vishesh prakaar kii rachanaayen pai jaati hai
 These compositions help in sucking up Makarandaka from very deep mukarandakoshas
 karmkaari madhumakhiyon main paraag ko ekatra karne ke liye pichhali taangon par paraag daliyaan hoti hai
 The flowers also have color and aroma to attract pests
 kuch pushpon kii rachana aisi hoti he ki keet bina paraag ekatra kiye makrand praapt kar hi nahin saktaa or jab vah duusare pushp par jaataa he to pushp kii rachana ke kaaran iske vartikagra par paraag giraae bina makrandkosh tak pahunch hi nahin saktaa
 Yucca flower and yucca shalabh are very beautiful examples of this
 jo keet vanaspati nahin khate, ve ucchhisht vastuon, anya kiton yaa anya jeevon ko apana bhojan banaate hai
 The cleaning insects live their lives on other abandoned items like garbage, etc
 sadi gali vanaspatiyon se bahut se kanchukpaksh, makkhiyaan tathaa anya keet aashray tathaa bhojan pate hai
 Dung, rotting carcasses of animals and their remains become food of some insect
 kiton kii ye kritiyaan manushya ke liye bahut laabhadaayak hai
 a dietary is a creature that subsists on other organisms, is a carnivore, is in search of its prey and eats it when it is found
 is prakaar kaa vyavhaar vibhinn virgon ke kiton main paaya jaataa he
 Their prey is any other insect, or invertebrate
 aise jivan ke kaaran in kiton kii taangon, mukh bhaagon or samvedak indriyon main bahut se parivartan ho jate hai
 In the behavior of some such insects, obvious changes are also visible
 kuch keet apni taangon kaa apane shikaar ko pakadaney tathaa bhakshan karte samay thaamne ke liye upyog karte hai
 Huntsman kites use their three pairs of legs, and only watery legs and mantids are used in this work
 is kaaran inaki taangon main parivartan paaya jaataa he
 The jaws of the disticus are pointed and forward to catch their prey
 vyadhapatang ke ninf kaa oshth anya kiton ke pakadaney ke liye vishesh akruti kaa ban jaataa he
 The combined eyes of these insects are particularly developed
 kuch apahari kiton kii taange daudane ke liye upyukt hoti hai or kuch tivrata se ud sakate hai
 Many cripples lay their eggs in contact with their prey, such as the lady-bird beetle lays its eggs near Drumayuca
 anek apahari apane shikaar kii pratiksha main chhipe baithe rahete hai or jaise hi unka shikaar unki pahunch main aata he, us par ekbargi jhapata maarthe hai, jaise mantis main apane ko gupt rakhane ke liye pattee jaisaa rang hota he
 Some of the waterway poles make a pit to catch their prey, ants
 paraseete ve keet hai jo anya jeevon par nirvaah to karte hai, kintu unka vadh kiye bina hi unase bhojan praapt karte hai or praaia: ek hi poshak par nirbhar rahete hai
 They often lay their eggs on their nutritious body
 paraseete keet do prakaar ke hote hai-ek jo kasheru k dandiyon par or duusare jo anya kiton tathaa unke sambandhiyon par jivit rahete hai
 The first class insects are the genus Anoplura, Malophaga and Cyphonaptera and belong to the Hippobosidae lineage
 ye paraseete apane poshak kii tulana main bahut chote hote hai
 The power to bear them develops in the nutrient and due to this their effect is not fatal
 inamen se adhiktar pahya paraseete hai or poshak ke sharir par rahete hai
 Apart from Cyphonaptera, the body of others is flattened from the top down and they stick to the body of the nutrient
 inke pairon par poshak ko pakade rahane ke liye hook hote hai tathaa netra ksheen yaa lupt ho jate hai
 The sides are also often lacking and even if they are, they are very small
 kiton ke paraseete ine gine hi hai
 Apart from Strepsiptus gana, the bee lice, breula, are only other examples
 ardh paraseete kaa vyavhaar apahari or paraseete ke madhya kaa sa hota he
 Initially it remains like a parasite, that is, it does not destroy the nutrient's much-needed senses, but later it behaves like a parasitic and it devours its nutrient
 yah praaia: apane andey poshak ke sharir ke upar yaa bheetar rakhata he
 Its eggs stick to the nutrient permanently and get their food from inside or outside the nutrient body
 adhiktar ye keet dwipaksh vansh kii texnidi or kalapaksh ke paracitica varg main hi paae jate hai
 Their adults are functional and not parasitic
 ardhparasite kaa aakaar poshak ke aakaar kii tulana main bada hota he or yah apane vyavhaar se poshak ko praaia: sadaa hi nasht kar detaa he
 Nutrients are mostly other pests, whose parasites are invaded by eggs or other unhygienic conditions
 praudh keet par kabhi bhi akraman nahin hota
 Pests of the Tachinidi lineage live within the nutrient, but lay the eggs above the nutrient, or away from the nutrient
 bahut se parashrayi kalapaksh bahya parashriton kii bhanti rahete hai, kintu adhiktar aantarik parashrayi hai or apane andey poshak kii twachaa ke bheetar pravisht kar dete hai
 The most important thing in semi-parasites is found in their respiratory system, especially in internal parasites, which respire the oxygen found in their nutrient blood
 kintu kuch aantarik ardhparasite aise bhi hai
 Which receive oxygen directly from the atmosphere
 kuch keet duusare kiton kaa to bhakshan nahin karte, kintu unki ekatra kii hui saamagree ko kha jate hai
 Such pests are called Inquiline
 ye keet saamaajik kiton ke ghoslon main bahutayat se paae jate hai
 a very well known example of this is wax moth, which lives in beehives and destroys canes

 The insect called atelura lives in ants and when an ant starts giving its inverted food to another ant, it drinks it
 kuch aise bhi keet hai jo apane poshakon ko, unke saath rahane ke badale main, laabh pahanchaate hai
 Some snakebites find shelter and food in the ants of the ants and in turn release secretions from their body, which these ants are very eager to get
 is sambandh kii antim shrenee yah hai kii chitiyaan srav ke badale main atithi kanchukpaksh ko vastut: bhojan detii hai
 This is a beautiful example of mutual benefit
 adhiktar kiton kii prakruti akele hi rahane kii hoti he, kintu kuch jatiyon ke keet niyat paristhiti main apni mandali bana lete hai
 In winter, when the temperature drops very low, domestic flies often gather together
 kuch illiyaan yuthchari hai or ek saath janmi hui sab illiyaan ek hi jaale main ek saath-saath rahati hai, kintu aisi mandaliyaan bhojan samaapt hote hi teetar bitar ho jaati hai or prayek illi swatantra rahane lagati he
 Many insects, compelled by many circumstances, gather to spend summers, to become pupas, and to pass cold
 inamen se ek paristhiti he surakshit sthaan kii khoj
 Due to the nature of living in the circle of insects, they are probably protected from parasitic and parasitic enemies and from adverse conditions
 bhramanakari kanchukapakshon kii jhundon main rahane or kriyasheel hone ke kaaran kuch raksha ho jaati he
 Locusts and butterflies become gregarious during migration
 helictus naamak ekaaki makshika bhoomi main bani hui surang ke mukh ke chaaron or nanhen-nanhen kamare banaati hai
 They keep food and eggs in these rooms, after which they keep protecting them
 yah us samay tak jivit bhi rah jaati hai jab tak andon se makshikaaye nikal na aaen
 That insect, which takes care of its offspring at least early in their life, can be said to be the first class of social life
 bhinn-bhinn virgon ke samjik kiton main bhinn-bhinn vilakshantaayen drushtigochar hoti hai, kintu inaki prayek mandali kaa sabase mahatvapurn lakshan yah hai ki ek hi kutub hota he, jisamen ek nar, ek maadaa or unki santan, yaa ek ganbhat maadaa or uski santan, arthath kam se kam do peediyaan ek hi sthaan par hi mil julkar rahati hai
 Real social life is found in jumbo, bees, ants and termites
 
 There is another type of symbiosis in which an insect sticks to the body of another insect
 jin kiton ke sharir par chipakate hai ve praaia: bade hote hai, kintu chota keet unako khaataa nahin hai, arthath koi haani nahin pahunchaata
 The triangulins of the Miloidei dynasty carry the ovum in their mosses on their bodies
 vahaan ye dimbh unki santan ko kha jate he
 Some parasites of the Silionidae lineage sit on the backs of female locusts
 jab tak tidde andey na rakh den unki peeth par chadhe rahete hai
 Finally they lay their eggs in the grasshopper eggs
 sabase sundar udhaaharan botfli kaa he
 The female fox sticks its eggs on the legs and body of the mosquito and when the mosquito reaches the human sucking blood, the eggs fall out of these eggs and attack their nutritious human
 kiton kii ek badi sankhya jal main rahati he
 They mostly live in fresh water, some are also found in saltwater and sea
 in kiton ke bahut se lakshan upyogi hote hai
 The smooth and shining body of many accents reduces water blockage while swimming
 bahut se kiton main jalpravaah main bahane se bachane ke liye vishesh prakaar ke saadhan paae jate hai, jaise kaali mackhiyon ke dimbh resham ke dhaagon ko atkaaye rakhte hai
 The oily secretion comes out from the glands found around the esophagus in the mosquito poles
 iske kaaran in sthanon ke bahyatvak main jalasantrasic gun aa jaataa he or vahaan jal thahar nahin paata
 Therefore, respiration continues uninterrupted
 kuch kiton, jaise paudura acvatika main aise bal hote hai jinke kaaran bahyatvak jalasantrasic ho jaataa he
 Due to this property, water cannot enter the respiratory tract
 inamen bhojan praapt karne ke liye bhi vishesh saadhan hote hai, yatha-odineta ke ninfon main labium kaa ghunghat ek jaal kaa kaary karata he
 There are vibrating burruses in the mouths of mosquito eggs which produce waves in the water and thus the microorganisms of the food reach their esophagus
 dietiscus kii pichhali taange patavaar ke aakar kii ho jaati hai
 Notonecta and Dietiscus run both of their hulls together while swimming, but Hydrophilus runs his last leg shift
 jirinus naamak kanchukpaksh madhya or pasch taangon se, jinamein bahut parivartan aa jaataa he, tivrata se chakkar lagaate hue ghumta or tairta he
 The eggs of some flies and mosquitoes float by the dominant industry of abdominal muscles
 bahut chote chote polinima naamak kalapaksh, jo jalawaasi kiton ke andon main parashrayi hote hai, apane pakshon kii sahaayta se jal main tairte hai
 The respiratory system of aquatic insects undergoes many changes
 ye trekkia, jalashvasanika yaa rakt jalashwasanika dwaara shwasan karte hai
 Some insects store the air near them and use it when they are immersed in water
 dwipakshon ke corthre naamak keet ke paardarshee dimbh kaa trekkia tantra saim ke aakaar kii do jodi thili si ban jaati he
 These bags act as buoyancy senses
 yah dimbh in theliyon kaa pariman kisi agyaat vidhi se pavirtit k saktaa he or is prakaar jal kii jis gaharaai main chaahe usee ke anusaar aapekshik guru tv utpann kar paata he
 Pests are found all over the world, from the snowy polar parts to the equatorial, warming regions near the equator
 inkaa vitaran anya sab sthaliy jeevon kaa tulana main sabase adhik vistrut he
 They are found in almost all places where vegetation can grow, that is, wherever they can get food
 kiton or anya jeevon kaa bhojan vanaspatiyaan hai
 Paksha is a composition of great importance
 pakshon ke kaaran kiton main athulit vitaransamarthy aa jaataa he, jo anya sthaliy jeevon main nahin paaya jaataa
 The power of distribution gives each species of insects the freedom to survive the intense competition and the impact of rigorous election, which results in excessive congestion in the finite area, but there are many insects whose distribution is limited
 saare sansar main manushyon ke gharon main paae janevaale kiton main telchatta, chaaval kaa suundwala keet, daalon ke keet aadi prasiddh he
 Apart from these, gram flour, potato moth, sweet potato dill and cabbage moth are also found all over the world
 isi prakaar aise bhi bahut se keet hai jo kisi vishesh pradesh yaa desh main hi paae jate hai
 Such distribution depends on many circumstances
 bhojanprapti or prakritik dashaaen nihsandeh bahut adhik prabhaavshaalee paristhitiyaan hai
 Waterborne pests cannot live where there is no water
 vrikshon kii chaal main rahane vaale keet un sthanon main nahin paae ja sakate jahaan vriksh hi na ho
 Natural barriers, such as high mountains, sea and desert, do not allow pests to be distributed from one country to another
 kuch keet, jaise safilise, bandgobhi kii titali aadi samshitoshna katibandh main hi paae jate hai
 Fruit flies, paddy pests etc
 are found only in the epoch
 kuch kiton main jaise tiddiyon or kuch titliyon main, kabhi-kabhi pravajan kii pravriti hoti he or ye sudur deshon tak pahanch jate hai
 But the modern distribution of many insects cannot be interpreted on the basis of the modern state of the earth and climate and therefore often has to resort to geological changes
 spring tail naamak keet newjiland or chile main paaya jaataa he
 From this, it can be inferred that the atactic continent was spread between these two countries at some time, because this insect is so soft and unbiased that it cannot be distributed in any other way
 spring tail kaa anya kiton kii tulana main sabase adhik vistrut vitaran he or is kaaran isane apane ko in vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anukool bana liya he
 Ants are also distributed in almost the same way and they have adapted themselves to different circumstances
 da biar, ne san 1954-55 main yah batalaaya ki miriapoda ke jo dimbh dimbhavstha main janan kar saken unako hi kiton kaa purvaj maananaa chahie
 To prove this, it is important to compare the adult of insects and some of the bones of Miriapoda, for example, that of Aeulus, a millipede
 aiulas kaa dimbh jab andey se nikalataa he, iskaa sir utane hi khandon kaa bana maaloom hota he jitne khandon kaa kiton kaa sir
 The rest of the body consists of about 12 segments, of which the first three segments each have a pair of legs
 chauthaa tathaa inke pechhevaale khand bhi bina taangon ke nahin hote
 But their growth is hindered and they remain very small
 is prakaar yah chah taangon vaala aiulas kaa dimbh ant main lanbaa praudh ban jaataa he, jiske sharir main bahut se khand or bahut si taange hoti he
 If the growth of the legs after the first three pairs of this egg is more hindered and about 12 sections of the body of the egg persist in adulthood, then this organism will be insect-shaped, with the legs behind the first three pairs of legs being either so weak
 That only their remains will be or they will be completely lost
 yah baat bahut hi rochak he ki vastav main aise keet hai jinamein udar par bhi taangon ke avshesh vartmaan hote hai, jaise campodia, jepix or machilis 
 These insects do not have favors, and they contain compositions that have disappeared from other insects, such as gonation of the gonads
 isliye kiton ke vikaas main in kiton ko miriapoda ke dimbhavstha main janane vaale dimbhon or anya kiton kii madhyavaali dasha kaa samajhnaa chahie
 It is also approved by many other arguments that insects originated from figures like Miriyapoda
 atyadhik sambhaavna yah he ki un sab lambey sharir or tongowale jeevon main miriapoda hi kiton ke purvaj hai, kyonki in main kai rachanaayen ek-si hoti hai udaahranarth, malepigian nalikaay or trekial nalikaay
 But it should also be noted that the insects could not have originated from the adult myriapoda, as they have many characteristics and characteristics
 epterigota upvarg adhiktar vividh prakaar ke kiton kaa ek samooh he or us upvarg kaa keval thisaneura gana hi terrigot kiton kii vikasawali mukhya shrenee ke sambhavat: sameep he
 It has been proved by logic that the remaining three gonas of Apertigota should not be considered insects
 kintu aisa koi santoshjanak kaaran prathit nahin hota he, jisase in teenon ganon ko is upvarg se pruthak kar diya jaae, yadhyapi isamen koi andeh nahin ki ye vilakshan rachanaayen pradarshit karte hai, udaahranarth colembola gana ke kiton main keval nau khand hi hote hai
 Anemorphosis occurs in the pests of the protura gana, the diplora, asymptomatic tracheal system found in the pests of gana, the muscles in the flagellum of the genus Dipura and colombala
 upvarg terrigota do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he-exopterigota or endopterigota 
 Exopterigota Ganes have a close relationship between Epimeraptra and Odoneta, as they are both palaepteron, Ganes
 yadi aadhunik kiton ke sharir ke siddhant se vichaar kiya jaay to blatteria, mantodia, isoptera, joreptra, gailoblattodia, ri jupaj, phesemida, plicoptera, dermaptra or ambioptra ri jupakshika orthoptred, samudaay ke antargat aate hai
 All of these properties form a community due to the following characteristics — unchanged mouthpiece, a pair of mustard on the posterior end of the giant anel lobe in the posterior, numberless malipagian tubules and several distinct tufts in the peritoneal nerve
 in ganon main se blatteria or mantodia main bahut adhik nikat sambandh hone ke kaaran in donon ko saath-saath dicteoptera ke antargat rakhte hai
 The remaining ganas of Exopterigota, namely Socoptera, Malophaga, Cyphanculata, Matkungana and Jallaripaksha, belong to the Matkunganik community
 matkunaganik samudaay ke lakshan is prakaar he: vishesh prakaar ke mandibulate yaa chusanevaale mukhbhaag hote hai, pashchapaksh main anelle lob nahin paaya jaataa, sarasai kaa abhaav hota he
 The number of malpigian tubules is very small, and the peritoneal nerves are almost collected
 ri jupakshik or matkunaganik samudaayon main spasht bhed nahin hai, kyonki joreptra main pakshon kii shirayen kuch ksheen ho jaati he, mailipigiyan nalikaaon kii sankhya bhi kam hoti he or tantrikatantu kii gucchhikaaye bhi kuch kuch ekatribhoot ho jaati he
 There seems to be a clear relationship between Socoptera and Malophaga, as both have eccentric types of hypopharyx
 sambhavat: simonculeta mellophayga se nikat sambandh rakhte hai
 With them, they not only have an analogy in many external and internal creations and nature, but there is also an analogy in the composition of the breath and the process of hatching
 ab prashn yah uthta he ki junon ke donon ganon ko ek hi gana ke antargat kyon nahin mana jaataa
 The reason for this is that there is so much difference between the faces of the two ganas
 ki inkaa pruthak pruthak ganon main rakhana hi praaia: uchit samajha jaataa he
 Considering Indopterygote pests, there is an extreme difficulty in keeping Kalapaksa, Strepsiptera and Kanchukapaksa with other Ganas, hence the rest of them are kept under Panorpid community
 panorapid samudaay jaalpaksh neuroptra ke saath micoptera par kendribhoot he or kuch kuch pruthak kintu sambandhi shakha banaata he
 It is more likely that the lower members of the Mikaptera originated on the one side as the bipartite and on the other side the Salki Paksha and Lomapaksha
 cyphonaptera ke praudhon kii rachana bahut bhinn hoti hai, kintu iske dimbh dwipaksh ke upagan nimetocera ke kuch dimbhon se bhinn nahin hote or yadi cyphonaptera kii utpatti aadi dwipakshon se na hui ho to kam se kam panorapid samudaay se to hui hi hogi
 There also seems to be some difficulty in the subject of acupuncture, ejaculate and strepsiptera
 kalapaksh ke upagan simphyta ke dimbh or panorapid kiton ke dimbhon main sadashya he, saath hi saath simphyta ke pakshon kii shira kii utpatti bina kisi kathinata ke, megacoptaran pattern se prathit hoti he
 For these two reasons it is also said that the ancestor of Kalapaksha and ancestors of jalapaksha and other panorpid villages were the same
 kanchuk paksh ke vishay main aisa vichaar he ki inaki utpatti anya indopterigot se bhinn rup main hui
 But some authors speculate that the origin of the Kanchukapaksha originated from the ancestors with a nettle shape
 strepciptera praaia: kanchukpaksh se sambandhit samajhe jate hai, kintu kuch lekhak inkaa sambandh kalapaksh ke nirdhaarit karte hai

 Unlike other Congress leaders, Gandhiji did not wear foreign clothes, used Hindi more and more in place of English and Sanatan used Hindu thinking in politics

 jinna ne congress ko gathbandhan ke liye aamantrit kiya
 At first they both decided that they would face the British together, but Jinnah stipulated that the Congress would have to consider a separate constituency for Muslims and the Muslim League as representative of the Muslims of India, which the Congress rejected
 congress main us samay kai muslim netaa the, isliye lig ko bhartiya musalamaanon kaa pratinidhi maananaa uske liye aasaan nahin tha

 One day Sri Ramachandraji called Bharata and Lakshmana to him and said, "O brothers, i wish to perform the Rajasuya Yajna as it is the culmination of Rajdharma
 is yajna se samast paap nasht ho jate hai tathaa akshay or avinashi fal kii prapti hoti he
 Therefore, both of you should think and say that will this sacrifice be good for the welfare of this world and hereafter? " bade bhai ke ye vachan sunakar dharmatma bharat bole, "maharaj! is prithvi par sarvottam dharm, yash or swayan yah prithvi aap hi main pratishthit he
 You, the whole earth and all the kings who live on it, consider you as Pitrulya

 " tatpashchaat lakshmana bole, "he raghunandan! sab paapon ko nasht karne vaala to ashwamegh yajna bhi he
 If you want to perform a yajna then do this yagna

 Once, he handed over the kingdom to his eldest son Madhureshwar and went into the forest to perform rigorous penance
 uski tapasya se indra kaa bhi asana hill gaya
 He went to Lord Vishnu and said that God! With the help of penance, Vritrasura has accumulated so much power that i can no longer rule him
 yadi usne tapasya ke falswaroop kuch shakti or badha lee to ham sab devataaon ko sadaa uske aadhin rahanaa padegaa
 That's why God Please save the whole world from his suzerainty
 kisi bhi prakaar uskaa vadh kijiye
 "upon hearing this prayer of Devraj Indra, Lord Vishnu said that you know this Devraj! i have love for Vritrasura
 isaliye main uskaa vadh nahin kar saktaa parantu tumhaari prarthana bhi main asweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 That is why i will divide my glory into three parts in such a way that you can kill Vritrasura yourself
 mere tej kaa ek bhaag tumhaare andar pravesh karegaa, doosraa tumhaare vajra main or teesraa prithvi main taaki vah vritrasur ke dharashayi hone par uskaa bhaar sahan kar sake
 After receiving this boon from God, Indra along with the gods went to the forest where Vritra was doing penance
 avasar paakar indra ne apane shaktishaalee vajra vritrasur ke mastak par de maaraa
 Due to this, the head of the circle was cut off and separated
 sir katate hi indra sochane lage, maine ek nirparaadh vyakti kii hatya karke baari paap kiya he
 Thinking this, they started going to some dark place to make atonement
 indra ke lop ho jane par devataaon ne vishnu bhagwaan se prarthana kii ki he dinabandhu! vritrasur maaraa to aapke tej se gaya he, parantu brahmahatya kaa paap indra ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 That is why you should provide a solution for their salvation
 yah sunakar vishnu bole ki yadi indra ashwamegh yajna karke mujh yajyapurush kii aradhana karenge to ve nishpaap hokar devendra pad ko praapt kar lenge
 Indra did the same and with the brilliance of the Ashwamegh Yajna, he got rid of brahmacharya
 " There is a story of Vritrasura, which has been returned by the foolish people that they have gone against both evidence and tactics
 'twashta ke putr vritrasur ne devon ke raja indra ko nigal liya
 Then all the gods came near Vishnu with great fear, and Vishnu gave a solution to kill him that - i will enter the ocean
 tum log, us phen ko uthaakar vritrasur ke maarna, vah mar jaayegaa
 ' yah paaglon kii si banaai hui puranagranthon kii katha sab mithyaa he
 It is appropriate for the best people to never accept them
 dekho satyagranthon main yah katha is prakaar likhi he ki -- Here the name of Sun is Indra

 He kills 'vritra' i

 cloud with his rays
 jab vah marake prithvi main gir padataa he, tab apane jalarup sharir ko sab prithvi main failaa detaa he
 Then several big-2 rivers are filled with it and go into the sea
 kisi ve nadi hai ki parvat or meghon se utpann hoke jal hi bahane ke liye hoti hai
 When Indra Meghroop kills Vritrasura from the sky and falls into the earth, then he falls asleep in the earth
 
 1
 
 Then the same cloud falls down from the sky and takes shelter of the mountain, that is, the cloud
 jisko sury apni kirnon se phir hanan karata he
 Like when someone peels the wood
 vaise hi vah megh ko bhi bindu-bindu karke prithvi main gira detaa he or uske sharirroop jal simat-simat kar nadiyon ke dwaara samudr ko aise praapt hote hai, ki jaise apane bachhadon se gaay daud ke milti hai
 
 2
 
 jab sury us atyant garjit megh ko chhin-bhinn karke prithvi main aise gira detaa he ki jaise koi manushya aadi ke sharir ko kaat kaat kar giraata he, tab vah vritrasur bhi prithvi par mritak ke samaan shayan karne vaala ho jaataa he
 
 3
 
 'nighantu' main megh kaa naam vrutra he--vrutra kaa shatru arthath nivarak sury he,sury kaa naam twashta he, uskaa santan megh he, kyonki sury kii kirnon ke dwaara jal kan hokar upar ko jaakar vaahan milke megh rup ho jaataa he
 And the vrittra name of the cloud is because Vrithrovrnote: 0 He is acceptable and he is the covering of light
 vrutra ke is jalarup sharir se badi-badi nadiyaan utpann hoke agaadh samudr main jaakar milti hai, or jitna jal talab va coop aadi main rah jaataa he vah maano prithvi main shayan kar rahaa he
 
 5
 
 vah vrutra apane bijli or garjanrup bhay se bhi indra ko kabhi jeet nahin saktaa
 In this way, both Indra and Vritra do the same thing as a war of words, that is, when the cloud increases, it removes the light of the Sun, and when the temperature of the Sun increases, it removes the cloud named Vritra
 is
 parantu is yuddh ke ant main indra naam sury hi kii vijay hoti he
 When the cloud rises and spreads wide in the earth and the sky, then it falls into the earth after killing the sun
 uske pashchaat vah ashuddh bhoomi, sade huye vanaspati, kashtha, trin tathaa malamutradi yukt hone se kahin-kahin durgandh rup bhi ho jaataa he
 Then the sea water starts to look terrible
 is prakaar baarambaar megh varshata rahata he
 Ie, water rises in the sky from all places
 vahaan ikattha hokar phir se varsha kiya karata he
 Many substances etc
 are produced from the same water and the earth's shade
 usee megh ko 'vritrasur' ke naam se bolte hai
 The names of Vayu and Surya are Indra
 vaayu akaash main or sury prakashasthan main sthit he
 It is the war of these Vritrasura and Indra in the sky that at the end of which the defeat of the cloud and victory of the sun is undoubtedly

 Atrial fibrillation is a type of abnormal heart attack that occurs in the atrium of the heart
 jab yah pehali baar hota he, yah aamtaur pe teevr hriday dar yaa teevr hriday spandan dar ke saath judaa hota he or supra ventricular teevr hriday spandan dar kii shrenee main aata he
 While this rhythm is often found in those people who may be deformed in heart and blood vessel diseases
 haalanki, yah shaayad hi kabhi varshon se lekar maheenon tak jari rahati he
 In 1920, Alindi Spuran was first recognized as a medical condition by the British physician 0} Sir Thomas Lewis and his colleagues
 jabaki alindi sphuran kabhi-kabhi dhyaan main nahin aa saktaa hai, iskaa shuruyaat niyamit ghabrahat kii abhilakshneey bodh ke dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Such sensations usually last until the episode ends, or the heart rate is under control
 shuru main alindi sphuran aamtaur par acchhee tarah se saha ja saktaa he, haalanki, anya antarnihit hriday kii beemaari yaa maamuli vyaayaam sahishnutaa vaale logon main teji se lakshan viksit ho saktaa he, jo saans kii takalif, seene main dard, moorchhaapan yaa chakkar aana, matlee or kuch rogiyon main, ghabrahat or asann qayaamat kii bhaawanaaon ko shaamil kar saktaa hai
 Prolonged rapid decompression can affect damage-loss, as well as heart failure due to loss of normal cardiac function
 yah kaary se ashishnutaa,, ratrikalin shwaas phoolnaa, athwa pair yaa pet kii sujan ke rup main prakat ho saktaa he
 Atrial pulsation is caused by a circular rhythm in the left or right of the cell
 aam taur par samay se pehle alind main uthta hua bijli se utpann hone vaali aaveg dwaara shuru hota he, alindi sphuran alind utak kii apvartak avadhi main antar ke vajah se vruddhi hota he
 It creates an impulse generated by electricity that moves in a local self-sustaining loop
 pash ke aasapaas prayek chakra ke liye, vahaan ek bijli se utpann hone vaali aaveg sristi hota he jo alind ke madhyam se vruddhi praapt karata he
 The effects and symptoms of atrial bleeding are dependent on the patient's heart rate
 hriday kii dar alindi gatividhi ke bajaay ventricular kaa ek maap he
 The impulses originating from the atrium are driven through the atrial ventricular node to the ventricle
 pehle se dirghakalin apvartak avadhi ke kaaran mukhyatah, e

 agar sphuran dar 300 / minute he, to ventricular dar 150 / minute athwa 2:1 hryday block dete hue in aavegon main se sirf aadhe aavegon kaa sanvahan kiya jayega
 dar ko niyantrit karne vaali dawaaon yaa samvahak pranali kii beemaari kii vruddhi is block ko kaaphi badha sakati hai 
 There are two types of atrial pulsation, normal type i and abnormal type II
 Alindy is one of the most common people with inflammation
 shaayad hi kabhi kisi main donon prakaar prakat ho, haalanki keval ek samay main ek hi prakaar prakat ho saktaa he
 Type i atrial pulsation whose atrial rate ranges from 240 to 350 pulsations / min and is known as simple atrial pulsation or common atrial pulsation
 haalanki, is dar ko ataltarodhi agent dhimaa kar saktaa he
 The reabsorptive loop traverses the right atrium from the tricuspid cavity of the narrow plexus, which is a fibrous tissue, the lower atrium between the lower cistern and the tricuspid valve
 prakaar i sphuran do or upaprakaar main bibhajit kiya jaataa he, jo pash main se vidyut pravaah kii disha par aadhaarit he or yah ghadi kii viruddh disha main alindi sphuran or ghadi kii disha main alindi sphuran ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Narrow pathoscopy is a method commonly available in the electrophysiology laboratory
 sankirnpath ke madhyam se pravaahakatva khatm karnaa rentry roktaa he or yadi yah safal hua to yah, alindi sphuran kii punrariti se bachaata he
 Type II pulsation, notably different, follows the re-entry route of type e and is typically faster, typically at 340–350 pulsations / min
 The left atrial atrophy is incomplete followed by the left atrial atrial excision procedure
 haalanki kai baar taal samasya hitkaari mana jaataa he
 Fibrillation related affinities are found in the atrial sputum
 in donon ke sthitiyon kii tulana ke bare main bahut kam aankade hai, lekin inke mrityu dar samaan dikhaai detaa he
 Fast heart rate can cause significant symptoms in patients with pre-existing heart disease
 jin rogiyon kaa nirogi hryday he un main bhi ventricular apghaton or hriday gati ruk sakati he jisaki shurvat main lambey samay tak ventricular teevr hriday spandan dar yah utpaada karata hai 
 Because there is very less effective contraction of the atrium, there is blood stasis in the atrium
 atisamvedansheel vyaktiyon ke dil main rakt tehraav rakt thakka ke gathan kar saktaa hai
 Blood clots are most likely to form in the atrial branch
 baaye alind shakha main rakt thakka sabase mahatvapurn hai kyun kii dil ke bain ore pure sareer main rakt kii aapurti karti he
 Thus, any clot that is removed from this part of the heart can make the brain inoperable with it leading to heart attack for potentially disastrous results
 thakka sharir ke kisi anya hisse ko bhi antahshalya bana saktaa he sakate hai, haalanki aamtaur par kam gambhir parinaam ke saath
 Sudden death is not associated with atrial pulsation
 However, in individuals with a pre-existing associative vascular tract, such as the Kent bundle in wolf-parkinson-white syndrome, the alveolar vascular tract may perform activities from the atrium to the ventricle at a rate in which a
 
V Nodes will be blocked
 AV Bypassing the node directs the rate of atrial fibrillation rate to 300 pulsations / min to 300 pulsations / min
 bhale hi ventrical hriday ke output ke ucch dar ko sanbhaalane ke liye sakasham he 1:1 sphuran samay ke saath saath ventricular tantuvikson main patit ho saktaa he jis se raktasancharprakaran hryday vifaltaa or maut ho saktaa he
 In general, atrial fibrillation should be treated as atrial fibrillation only because both rhythms may cause clot formation in the atrium, individuals with atrial fibrillation usually require some form of anti-platelet agent or anticoagulation
 donon taal khatarnaak teji se dil kii dar ke saath sambandhit he or is tarah kii dar yaa taal niyantran ke liye dawa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Additionally, there is some specific consideration for the treatment of atrial fibrillation
 alind sphuran alind vikampan kii tulana main kaaphi adhik bijli kii pratyaksh-hrittalavardhan ke prati samvedansheel he or aamtaur par ek kam urja shaq kii aavashyaktaa he
 20–50J is usually sufficient to return to the sinus rhythm
 iske vipareet, yah apekshaakrit rasinic hrittalavardhan ke liye pratirodhi he or aksar sinus taal par vaapasi se pehle alind vikampan main adhampatan hota he
 Due to the spherical nature of atrial pulsation, often this circuit separation is possible that causes atrial pulsation
 yah electrophysiology prayogshaala main alindi sphuran karne vaale circuit ki skaar utak par nishaan ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Separation of the narrow pathway, as noted above, is a common treatment for atrial fibrillation

 The dialect of North Corsica meets Toscano

 Even though they evolved from the same original source, their differences may have come in different ways to pronounce Latin in these dialects
 bahari akramanon kaa bhi prabhaav padaa hoga
 There are beautiful Rustic songs in the dialects of Italy which are now being collected and studied
 boliyon main sajivta or vyanjanashkti paryaapt he
 The folk songs of Nopolitano are very famous
 naveen sadi ke aarambh kii ek pehle "indovinello veronese" milti he jisamen aadhunik italvi bhashaa ke shabdon kaa prayog hua he
 Even before that, the use of Latin apostles are found in the accounts of the accounts written in Latin, which inform the beginning of modern language
 saatvin or aathvin sadi main likhit patron main sthanon ke naam tathaa kuch shabdon ke rup main milte hai jo naveen bhashaa ke dyotak hai
 Gradually, the dialect of literary Latin and the general language gradually increased, and modern Italian developed from the Latin of dialect itself
 is boli ke anek namoonay milte hai
 a testimony in the context of the Panchayat of the boundary of the monastery of Montecassino in 960 is found in the then dialect; a similar dialect and article written in Latin Apabhramsa is found in the church of Saint Clemente of Rome
 oombria tathaa marke main bhi 11veen 12veen sadi kii bhashaa ke namoonay dharmik sweekaaroktiyon ke rup main milte hai, kintu italvi bhashaa kii padhyabaddh rachanaaon ke udhaaharan sicili ke samrat fredrick dwitiya ke darbari kaviyon ke milte hai
 These poems may have been composed in the dialect of Sicily
 shringaar hi in kavitaaon kaa pradhan vishay he
 Pierre Dalla Vinya, Yakopo the Aquino, etc
, were in the court of Frederick, a number of scholars
 vah swayan kavi tha
 After Venevetto's war, the literary and cultural center became Toscana, instead of Sicily, where the sangarivayak Gitikavya was composed, Guittone del Viva de Arrezzo was the principal poet of this stream
 florence, pisa, lukka tathaa aarejjo main is kaal main anek kaviyon ne tatkaaleen boli main kavitaayen likhin
 There was an attempt to stabilize the form of literary language in Bolon
 sicili or toskana kavyadharaon ne saahitiyik italvi kaa jo rup prastut kiya use antim or sthir rup diya "dolche stil novo" ke kaviyon ne
 These poets kept such a form of artistic restraint, refined interest and refined rich language that for many centuries ahead Italian writers kept writing in this as their ideal
 dante alimieri ne isi naveen style main, toskana kii boli main, apni mahaan kriti "divina komediya" likhi
 Dante also introduced a refined form of prose in "convivio" and introduced a form of natural prose different from the artificial and ordinary colloquialism of Guido Faba and Guittonne de Arezzo
 dante tathaa "doche stil novo" ke anya anuyaayiyon main agraganya hai fronchesco, petrarka or jvovanni bokkacho
 Petrarca refined and organized the language of Florence
 petrarka kii kavitaaon or bokkacho kii kathaon ne italvi saahitiyik bhashaa kaa atyant suvyavasthit rup saamne rakhaa
 The writers behind took inspiration from the works of Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio for centuries
 15veen sadi main laathini ke pracheen sahitya ke prashansakon ne laathini ko chalaane kii cheshtaa kii or pracheen sabhyataa ke adhyayanwaadiyon ne naveen saahitiyik bhashaa banane kii cheshtaa kii, kintu yahi laathini pracheen laathini se bhinn thi
 As a result of this trend, what should be the form of literary language, the problem arose
 ek dal vibhinn boliyon ke kuch tatv lekar ek nai saahitiyik bhashaa gadhane ke paksh main tha, ek dal toskana, visheshkar florence kii boli ko yah sthaan dene ke paksh main tha or ek dal, jisamen pietaro bembo pramukh tha, chahta tha ki dante, petrarka or bokkacho kii bhashaa ko hi adarsh mana jaae
 Machiavelli also favored Fiorentino
 toskana kii hi boli saahitiyik bhashaa ke pad par pratishthit ho gai
 Further in 1612, Kruska Academy published the first dictionary of the Italian language, which helped to stabilize the literary language form
 18veen sadi main ek nai sthiti ai
 French began to have a great influence on the Italian language
 french vichaardhaara, style, shabdaawalee tathaa vaakyanshon se or muhaavaron ke anuwaadon se italvi bhashaa kii gati rug gai
 The French rationalist movement was its primary cause
 italvi bhashaa ke anek lekhakon-aalgarotti, verry, bekkaaria-ne ni:sankoch french kaa anusaran kiya
 The biases of the pure Italian were greatly hurt by this
 milan ke nivasee alessandro manjoni ne is sthiti ko suljhaayaa
 They considered it necessary to have a language for the unity of the nation and they considered the language of Florence to be suitable for that place
 apane upanyaas "i promessi sposi" main florence kii bhashaa kaa saahitiyik adarsh rup unhone sthapit kiya or is prakaar toskana kii bhashaa hi antim rup se saahitiyik bhashaa ban gai
 This problem was definitely solved after Italy attained political unity
 vishvaprapanch, germany ke prasiddh pranishastri or bhautikwaadi darshanik ernst hekkel kii pustak ridl of da univers kaa acharya shukla dwaara kiya gaya hindi anuwaad he
 In the translation statement, Acharya Shukla himself has written that 'riddle of the Universe' is the principle text of the non-materialistic side
 isamen naanaa vigyaanon se pusht un sab tathyon kaa sangrah he jinhen bhootvaadi apane paksh ke pramaan main upasthit karte hai
 At the time it was published, it was a big hit in Europe
 akele germany main do maheene ke bheetar isaki 9000 pratiyaan khap gayin
 Its translations were found in all the languages of Europe
 angreji kii to lakhon kapiyaan prithvi ke kone se lekar duusare kone tak pahunch gayin
 This book put the most uproar among the clergy whose hundreds of abused books came out in its counter-protest
 jo pustak anaatmavaadi aadhibhautik paksh kaa siddhanth-granth ho or jiske pratwaad main padariyon kii gaaliyon se bhari hui saikadon pustaken nikali hon use sadgranth to nahin hi kah sakate ! lekin dharm main aasthaa rakhanevaale or vishwaason main aastik acharya shukla atyant shram or utsaah se is pustak kaa hindi main anuwaad karte hai jo ki koi sahitya kii pustak na hokar ek pranishastra kii pustak thi ! kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki us samay hindi main pranishastra kii paribhaashik shabdaawalee kaa nirmaan nahin hua tha
 Acharya Shukla also constructs this vocabulary and wants to spread Hekkel's ideas to the entire Hindi speaking area by presenting the translation of 'riddle of the Universe' in Hindi in a very Pranjal language
 hekkel poonjeewaad ke samarthak the lekin unki pustak bhavvaadi darshan ko ayuktiyukt pramanit kar bhautikwaadi darshan kii sthapana karti thi
 In Russia, the court even ordered all copies of the Russian translation of this book to be confiscated and burned in the fire
 lenin ne ridl of da univers ke bare main likhaa he ki lekhak ke poonjeewaadi raajnneetik vichaaron ke baavjood poonjipati-varg ke viruddh yah lokapriy pustika varg-sangharsh kaa hathiyaar ban gayi
 What a coincidence it is that in Russia, Acharya Shukla presents his linguism in India, which Lenin considers so highly
 Not surprisingly, not in the era of Acharya Shukla, this book is discovered much later and its role becomes an important means of spreading materialistic consciousness
 vishvaprapanch kii visheshta yah he ki iske saath 126 prishthon kii ek bhoomika lagi he jisamen pustak main abhivyakt vichaaron ke sambandh main acharya shukla kaa apana chintan bhi diya gaya he
 Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma owes this role to the attention of Hindi readers
 or ise sahaj-sulabh banane kaa shrey dow namvar singh ko 
 It is quite natural that this role was not noticed by the disciples of Acharya Shukla and the critics who consider themselves to be critics to develop their tradition, but to those critics who are 'heretics' and 'tradition-traitors' in Hindi
 That is, Marxist critics! ukt bhoomika ke armbh main hi hamen acharya shukla kaa yah kathan miltaa he gat shatabdi main yorape main jyon-jyon bhautik vigyaan, rasayan, bhugarbha vidya, pranivigyaan, shareeravigyaan ityadi ke antargat nayi-nayi baton kaa pataa lagane laga or naye-naye siddhanth sthir hone lage, tyon-tyon jagat ke sambandh main logon kii jo bhavanaayen thim, ve badalane lageen
 Where earlier people could not find the cause of even the smallest thing and satisfied it as the work of God, there was such a wide range of work-reasons by the different sciences that no one needed to be interrupted
 She left
 gyaan-drushti ko bahut dur tak badhaane ke liye maarg khul gaya
 The belief expressed in scientific progress in this statement is worth noting
 vigyaan ke prati acharya shukla kaa drushtikon vigyaan-yaan par chadhi hui sabhyataa doobane jaati he vaale drushtikon se kitna bhinn he ! unhone vigyaan kii sabase badi visheshta-kaary-kaaran kii shrinkhalaa kaa anusandhan ko lakshya kar liya he, saath hi uske parinaam ko bhi, jisase jagat ke sambandh main logon kii yah dharna badalane lagi hai ki vah ishvarkrut he
 Further he says, earlier in relation to the living beings, the belief of the people was that all the types of creatures nowadays, all were born together at the beginning of the creation, that is, all kinds of creatures were in the structure etc
 without any change
 As of now, they are still alive
 darvin ne is vishwaas kaa khandan kiya or ‘vikaas siddhanth’ kii sthapana karke yah siddh kar diya ki ye anek prakaar ke dhaanchon ke jo itane jeev dikhaayi padate hai sab ek hi prakaar ke atyant sade dhaanche ke kshudra aadim jeevon se kramshah karodon varsh kii vansh-parampara ke bich, sthiti ke anusaar apane avyavon main bhinn-bhinn parivartan praapt karte hue or uttarottar bhedanusaar anek shakhaon main vibhakt hote hue utpann hue hai
 According to this development sequence, human beings also originated from those creatures of the earlier era from which monkeys were born, that is, ancestors of humans and humans were the same
 acharya shukla ne iske baad jo tippanee kii he vah dilachasp he is vikaswad se badi khalabali machi
 It was against the belief of the general public and the mythological creation of religious books
 hamaare yahan bhi puraanon main yoniyaan sthir kahi gayi hai or unki sankhya bhi churaasi lakh bataa di gayi he
 In Garuda Purana, there is even a count of vagrants of each class
 darvin ne yah acchhee tarah siddh karke dikhaa diya he ki ek jati ke jeevon se hi kramshah duusari jati ke jeevon kii utpatti hui he
 The vaginas are not stable, according to the situation, there are changes in their components etc
 among innumerable vaginas, due to which the branch of vagina organisms has moved from the organisms of the vagina
 vikaswad kaa nirupan karne or us par apni raay dete chalane ke baad acharya shukla ne ‘vishvaprapanch’ kii bhoomika main kaha he isi vikaswad ko lekar haikal aadi ne apane prakrutwad yaa anaatmavaad kii pratishtha kii he jiskaa virodh puranic kathaon tak hi nahin rah jaataa, balki saare ishwarwadi yaa aatmavaadi darshanon tak pahunchataa he
 Even after accepting the theory of development, most of the philosophies consider the eternal conscious element and realize it in many ways
 haikal chaitanya ko dravya kaa ek parinaam kehete hai jiskaa vikaas jantuon ke mastishk hi main hota he
 He says that the soul is nothing but body religion
 atah use sharir se pruthak ek abhautik nity tatva maananaa bhul he
 Along with the body, it also becomes a history
 antajkaran ko apane vyapaaron kaa jo bodh hota he vahi chetana he
 Just as there are many types of anger in the senses and senses by subject interaction, similarly there is also a sense of the rites generated by them in the brain
 atah chetana bhi bhautik antajkaran kaa hi vyapaar he jo us kaaran ke nasht hone par nasht ho jaati he
 But this is the side of Hekkel or materialism, not Acharya Shukla
 acharya shukla kehete hai, ab prashn yah hota he ki kya vikaswad jagat ke samast vyapaaron ke mul kii samyak vyakhya kar detaa he ? sach puuchhie to uski pahunch kii bhi had he
 Take for instance physical development and development of the mind
 sharir vyapaar or manovyapaar dono main, ek hi prakaar ke niyamon kii charitarthta, donon kaa saath-saath uttarottar kram se vikaas, dikhaaya gaya he sahi, par donon ek nahin siddh ho sake hai
 All the representations of evolutionism have not been able to explain the primacy of mind or soul
 or to jane dijie kis prakaar samvedansutra kaa bhautik spandan samvedan ke rup main parinat ho jaataa he yahi rahasy nahin khulata
 No other result of this kind is seen in the physical world
 is kathinata ko kuch log yah kahkar dur kiya chaahate hai ki dravya ke prayek parmaanu main ek prakaar kii antahsangya yaa avyakt samvednaa hota he jo aakarshan or apasaaran ke rup main prakat hota he
 But we want to know the origin of consciousness, that is, the mind's own instinct of realization of its rites, from which this conscience is different
 haikal ne mastishk ke bheetar pratibimb yaa sanskaar grahan karanevaala jo ek prapyakari avyav bataaya he usase bhi chetana kaa vyapaar samajhane main subhita nahin hota
 Just by saying that the image is reflecting on an object, it is not understood that that object also realizes that i have an image or image of this kind
 is prakaar chetana kii utpatti or uske swaroop ko lekar acharya shukla uljhan main pad jate hai lekin ve aashaa nahin chhodte hai
 His statement is very important: "fermentation-related chemistry has been progressing equally
 kai prakaar ke kinv yaa khamir, paudhon yaa jantuon se praapt sharir-dravya ke aashray ke bina, kuch mul dravyon ke parmaanuon ke yoga se bana liye gayi hai
 This legislation has reached the origin of living matter and there is a lot of hope from it
 sajivta kaa jivan vastav main kinv-parampara hi he
 It is here in the footnote that he quoted the quote from Charvaka, which states that the four physical elements result in the incarnation of the Madashaktivat Chaitanya and their destruction is also destroyed
 pashchim ke vaigyanikon main kuch anishvaravaadi hue hai kuch ishwarwadi or kuch sanshaywaadee
 There was a lot of emphasis on the power of the soul by a scientist named Oliver Lodge
 unka mat vistaar se uddhrut karke uske neeche acharya shukla ne apni yah tippanee di he, yorape or america main kuch dinon se paroksh shakti ke sadhak bhi khadey hue hai jo anek prakaar kii siddhiyaan dikhaakar aatmasatta kaa astitv pratipaadit karne kaa udyog karte hai
 They talk about the souls of dead men and tell them about the existence of supernatural events
 Many magazines also come out from them
 par inamen se adhiktar chal or prapanch kaa aashray lete hai isse shikshiton or vaigyanikon kii in par aasthaa nahin he
 Many use unusual practices or stages of conscience
 par in yuktiyon se shikshiton kaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 Then what is the solution? Acharya Shukla was in search of truth
 bhavvaadi darshanik param satya ko ek batalaate the jo ki chetan tha
 On the other hand, scientists were also revealing the ultimate element which was a ghost
 acharya shukla ne isse darshan or vigyaan ko lekar ek sameekaran taiyaar kiya or kaha ki bhedon main abhed gyaan or dharm donon kaa lakshya he
 Science is looking for this impulse, religion is looking towards it
 yahan kaha ja saktaa he ki acharya shukla ne vigyaan or darshan athwa vigyaan or dharm ko ek bindu par laa khadaa kiya he, jabaki in donon ke bich kaa fark unhen acchhee tarah se maaloom tha
 He has written in this role of Vishwanaparanch, there is a great distinction between scientific determination and philosophical inference
 darshanik sanket maatr dete hai or vaigyanik byoron kii chaanbin karte he
 But as stated in the beginning, Acharya Shukla was a member of the newly educated Indian middle class
 is kaaran unke lekhan kaa ek nishchit saamaajik sandarbh tha
 In his time, religious disputes were going on intensely, causing a tension situation among the various religious sects of the society
 swabhaavatah unhone kaha ki naanaa maton or majahabon kii vishesh sthool baton ko lekar jhagada tanta karne kaa samay ab nahin he
 The common sense of religion and God among all faiths and communities can now come under the educated side
 ishwar saakaar he ki niraakaar, lambi dadhiwala he ki chaar haathawaala, arabi bolta he ki sanskrit, murti poojanevaalon se dosti rakhata he ki aasmaan kii ore haath uthaanewaalon se, in baton par vivaad karanevaale ab keval uphaas ke paatr honge
 Similarly, the ancient mythology and mythologies related to the mysteries of the universe which science has uncovered, they can no longer offer the work of shield and sword
 ab jinhen maidan main janaa ho ve naanaa vigyaanon se tathy sangrah karke sidhe us seemaa par jaaen jahaan do paksh ade hue hai - ek ore aatmavaadi, duusari ore anaatmavaadi; ek ore jadwaadi duusari ore nity chaitanyavaadee
 If the eternal power of Chaitanya became universally accepted, then the feeling of all opinions was supported, because Chaitanya is all-pervasive
 naanaa bhedon kii abheddrushti hi sachhee tatvadrushti he
 It is through this that the experience of truth and the antagonism of dissent can be eliminated
 is uddhran main kai baaten dhyaan dene yogya hai
 One is that Acharya was in favor of taking Shukla philosophy out of intellectual concepts and making it useful in life, so that it can be used to avoid the conflict-ridden rage in society
 isi se sambaddh duusari baat yah he ki unki sabase badi chintaa bhedon main abhed ko dekhne kii thi, jisase ki bhedbhaav ke sthaan main maanviya sauhaard or ekatv kii sthapana ho sake
 That is why at the end of the role he strongly advocated the opposition of Prophetic monotheism and formalistic Brahmanism as it expanded the Rigvedic spirit of 'one Sadvipra Bahudha Vdanti'
 acharya shukla darshan ke kshetra main chhide bhavvaad or bhautikwaad ke sangharsh ko saaf-saaf dekh rahe hai
 Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma has drawn our attention to the word 'if' used in "if the eternal power of Chaitanya has become universally accepted", which is very important
 iskaa matlab yah he ki acharya shukla bhavvaad or bhautikwaad ke sangharsh ko nirnay par pahunchaa hua nahin maanate
 They are only willing to know the truth
 They are waiting for the truth to come, as semiotic advaita or as spiritual advaita
 unki mukhya chintaa samaaj ko lekar he
 This is the third notice in the above quote
 vikaswad ke prabhaav se acharya shukla ne sampoorn maanav-sabhyataa ko vikasman mana
 He has written that according to this theory, in the same way it is imperfect that by progressing from Sha, civilized condition has been attained
 manushya aisa praani sristi ke aadi main hi ek baar utpann ho gaya, usee prakaar yah bhi asiddh he ki manushya jati ke bich dharm, gyaan or sabhyataa aadim kaal main bhi utani hi yaa usase badhkar thi jitani aajkal he
 The modern view is that mankind is uncivilized and gradually that knowledge has increased
 isi prakaar dharmbhav bhi pehle bahut swalp or sade rup main tha, peeche saamaajik vyavhaaron kii vruddhi ke saath-saath uskaa bhi anek roopon main vikaas hota gaya
 Further, he has said more clearly about religion that religion and ethics have been explained only from the point of view of public behavior and social development, not from the view of the hereafter and spirituality
 dusron ke prati jo aacharan ham karte hai usee main achche or bure kaa aarope ho saktaa he
 Substantive wisdom has arisen from behavior-related relations
 in kathanon main acharya shukla ne saamaajik vyavhaar yaa vyavhaar sambandh kii jo baat kahi he uskaa khulaasa yah he ki sabhyataa or dharm kaa vikaas samaaj ke bheetar hua he
 It is because of that, no more than that
 samaaj se alag kisi sabhyataa or samskruti kaa vikaas sambhav nahin he
 This is clearly a manifestation of materialistic vision
 maamla chunki dharm kaa he jiskaa aloukikta se anivaary sambandh mana jaataa rahaa he, isliye acharya shukla vikaswad kii etatsambandhi manyata kaa punah ullekh karte hue uskaa samarthan karte he vikaswad kii vyakhya ke anusaar dharm koi alokik, nity or swatantra padaarth nahin he
 It has evolved gradually from the shelter of the society
 dharm kaa koi aisa saamaanya lakshan nahin bataaya ja saktaa jo sarvatra or sab kaal main manushya jati kii jab se utpatti hui he tab se ab tak baraabar maanya rahaa he
 As the society grew, it was also changed in the spirit of religion as per the time period
 koi samay tha jab ek kul duusare kul kii striyon ko churaana yaa ladakar chhinana acha samajhataa tha
 No one used to stand in the way of slaughtering at the altars of the gods
 bible main iske kai ullekh hai, shunagashep kii vaidic gaatha bhi ek udhaaharan he
 In a nutshell, Acharya Shukla's world-view was a philanthropist rather than a philanthropist, in whose construction there was more scientific research and thinking than religion and sentimental philosophy
 unki yahi drushti, joki nirantar vikasman he unke saamaajik raajnneetik, saanskrithik or saahitiyik chintan main abhivyakt hui he
 'vishwa Prapanch' is a pioneer in the Hindi translation genre
