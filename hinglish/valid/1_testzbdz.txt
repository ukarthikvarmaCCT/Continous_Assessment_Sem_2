 People used to come to the court of King Vikramaditya for justice with their problems and sometimes they were also present with questions which they did not think of any solution
 vikram un prashnon kaa aisa sateek hal nikaalte the ki prashnkartta purna santusht ho jaataa tha
 One day two ascetics came to the court with a crooked question and they requested Vikram to answer their question
 unamem se ek kaa maananaa tha ki manushya kaa man hi uske saare kriya-kalap par niyantran rakhata he or manushya kabhi bhi apane man ke viruddh kuch bhi nahin kar saktaa he
 The other did not agree with his opinion
 uskaa kahana tha ki manushya kaa gyaan uske saare kriya-kalap niyantrit karata he
 The mind is also the slave of knowledge and that too is bound to follow the instructions given by knowledge
 raja vikramaditya ne unke vivaad ke vishay ko gaur se suna par turant us vishay par apana koi nirnay nahin de paae
 He asked both those ascetics to come after some time
 jab ve chale gaye to vikram unke prashn ke bare main sochane lage jo sachmuch hi bahut tedha tha
 He thought for a moment that man's mind is really very fickle and after being subjugated, man becomes subject to worldly lust
 magar duusare hi pal unhen gyaan kii yaad ai
 He felt that knowledge really tells man to think before he says mind and motivates him to make a decision
 vikram aise uljhe sawaalon kaa jawaab saamaanya logon kii zindagi main khojate the, isliye ve saadhaaran naagarik kaa vesh badalakar apane rajya main nikal pade
 He did not see any such thing for several days which would help in solving the question

 He was tired and resting under a tree

 He became anxious to know the reason for his plight
 unhone usase poocha ki uski yah dasha kaise hui jabaki marate samay gopal das ne apana sara dhan or vyapaar apane donon putron main samaan rup se baant diya tha
 The wealth of one part was enough that life could be lived comfortably for two books
 vikram ne phir uske bhai ke bare main bhi jaanane kii jigyaasa prakat kii
 The young man understood that the inquirer really had all the information about his family
 usne vikram ko apane or apane bhai ke bare main sab kuch bataa diya
 He told that when his father divided everything between him and his brother, his brother used his share of money very wisely
 usne apni zarooraton ko simit rakhkar sara dhan vyapaar main laga diya or din-raat mehnat karke apane vyapaar ko kai guna badha liya
 He did not take any inspiration from his intelligent and sober brother and was overwhelmed with pride at the immense wealth he had received on his part
 sharabkhori, randibaaji jua khelnaa samet sari buree aadaten daal leen
 All these habits began to hollow out his wealth of wealth

 These bad habits led him to destruction very quickly and within a year he became a pauper

 When he had a lot of wealth, he could not control the fickleness of the mind
 dhan barabaad ho jane par use sadbuddhi ai or thokaren khaane ke baad apni bhul kaa ehsaas hua
 When the king asked if he would tell the mind again when the money comes, he said that the stumbles of the times have given him true knowledge and now on the strength of that knowledge he can control his mind
 vikram ne tab jaakar use apana asli parichay diya tathaa use kai swarna mudraayen dekar hoshiyaari se vyapaar karne kii salaah di
 He assured her that Lagna Shilata would bring him back to earlier prosperity
 usase vidaa lekar ve apane mahal laut aae kyonki ab unke paas un tapasweon ke vivaad kaa samaadhaan tha
 After some time both of them attended the desire of ascetic solution in their court
 vikram ne unhen kaha ki manushya ke sharir par uskaa man baar-baar niyantran karne kii cheshtaa karata he par gyaan ke bal par vivekshil manushya man ko apane par haaavee nahin hone detaa he
 There is an interplay between mind and knowledge and both have their own importance

 ab raja tasveere bana-bana kar apana man bahalane lage
 He never cared about his queens
 jab raniyaan kai dinon ke baad unke paas ain to raja ko khadiya ne chitra banaate hue dekha
 When the queens came and diverted their attention, the king laughed and said that they too had become subordinate to the mind

 Guru Ghasidas Village Girodpuri Tahsil was born here in Balodabazar district Raipur to father Mahangudas ji and mother Amarotin
 Guruji Satnam Satnam Dharma, which is called the originator of Satnami religion in common parlance, Guruji Bhandarpuri certified saint society as his religious place With the power of truth, the descendants of Guruji still live there
 unhone apane samay kii saamaajik aarthik vishmata, shoshan tathaa jatibhed ko samaapt karke maanav-maanav ek samaan kaa sandesh diye
 In 1672, at the place called Narnaul in present day Haryana, two brothers named Sadh Birbhan and Jogidas preached the Satnami Sadh Mat
 satnami saadh mat ke anuyaayi kisi bhi manushya ke saamne nahin jhukne ke siddhant ko maanate the
 He respected but did not bow down to anyone
 ek baar ek kisaan ne tatkaaleen mughal badshaah aurangzeb ke karinde ko jhuk kar salaam nahin kiya to usne isko apana apmaan maanate hue us par lathi se prahaar kiya jiske pratyuttar main us satnami saadh ne bhi us kaarinde ko lathi se peet diya
 This dispute did not end here and the tussle continued and slowly reached the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb that the Satnamis had revolted
 yaheen se aurangzev or satnamiyon kaa aitihaasik yuddh hua tha
 Which was led by Satnami Sadh Birbhan and Sadh Jogidas
 yuddha kai dinon tak chalaa jisamen shahi fouj maar nihathe satnami samooh se maat khaati chali ja rahi thi
 It was also spread in the royal army that Satnami groups are defeating the royal army by witchcraft
 iske liye aurangzeb ne apane phogiyon ko quran kii aayatein likhe tavij bhi bandhavaaye the lekin iske baavjood koi farak nahin padaa tha
 But he did not know that Satnami Sadhas had this condition due to spiritual power

 Those who did not complete the tenacity escaped in different directions after saving their lives

 kyon ki bramhanon or mandir ke pujaariyon dwaara hinduon ke dharmik shoshan kaa virodh karne ke kaaran unhen samaaj se dur karne kaa yahi maarg un logon ko soojha tha
 The effect of which is visible till date
 unki jayanti har saal puure chhattisgarh main 18 disambar ko manaaya jaataa he
 Guru Ghasidas was very sad to see discrimination among castes and lack of brotherhood in the society
 ve lagaataar prayaas karte rahe ki samaaj ko isse mukti dilaai jaae
 But they did not see any solution to this

 The term Dasnami is used to refer to an organization of ascetics and is famously first run by Swami Shankaracharya, but it is sometimes attributed to Swami Suresvaracharya, who was the third Acharya of the Shringeri Matha in South India

 The separate acharyas of these four are referred to as Hastamalak, Trotkacharya, Padmapadacharya and Swaroopacharya respectively and their various traditions as well as the above mentioned names like Puri, Bharati and Saraswati, Giri Parvat and Aranya and Tirtha and Ashram respectively
 Is discussed
 in chaaron main se shrungery math kaa kshetra andhra, dravid, karnataka evam kerala pradeshon tak simit samajha jaataa he, iskaa tirthasthan rameshwaram he, iskaa veda yajurveda he, mahavakya "ahan brahmasmi" he, gotra "bhuriver" he or iske brahmacharee "chaitanya" kehalaate hai jahaan joshi math ke kshetra main uttar ke kuru, paanchal, kashmir, kamboj evam tibet aadi aa jate hai, iskaa tirthasthan badarikashram he, veda atharvaveda he, mahavakya "aymatma brahm" he, gotra "aanandavar" he tathaa iske brahmacharee bhi "anand" kahe jate hai
 Similarly, the area of govardhanmath also extends to Anga, Vang, Kalinga, Magadha, Utkal and Barbar, its pilgrimage place is Puri, its Veda is Rigveda, Mahavakya is "pragyanam Brahma", gotra is "bhogavar" and its brahmachari says "prakash" Go where the area of shardamath goes as far as Indus, Sauvir, Saurashtra and Maharashtra
 iskaa veda samaveda he, mahavakya "tatvamasi" he, gotra "kitvar" he tathaa iske brahmacharee bhi "swaroop" kahe jate hai jo dusron se sarvatha bhinn he
 There are also 52 strongholds of Dushanamis, of which 27 are said to be of Giris, 16 of men, 4 of Indians, 4 of forests and 1 of lamas and half of the pilgrimages, ashrams, Saraswatis and Indians, ie three and a half "dandi" and the rest Six are called "gosai"

 The Dasnami monk who becomes a disciple of any such monastery and becomes his successor also has to manage it
 dashanami sanyasiyon kaa uddeshy dharmprachaar ke atirikt dharmaraksha kaa bhi jaan padataa he
 He has also organized his organization in the form of various akhadas for the accomplishment of this second objective
 aise akhaadon main se "june akhaada" ke ishtdev kalbhairav athwa kabhi-kabhi dattatreya bhi samajhe jate hai or "aavahan" jaise ekaadh anya akhaade bhi usee se sambandhit hai

 Once in Paris, Paul got his hand in a magazine called Vaishnav "back to God"
 In his cover he had seen a portrait of the happy and happy Vaishnava and the title: "the joy of life is different from the happiness of the body

 Already in London, in 1971, Paul decided to visit the Vaishnav temple

 tab paulus vaishnav hataaya sadak he, jo vah vastav main pasand ke saath chalaa gaya
 Two days later he is home again, where he met him at the entry Vaishnav monk
 He came for suggestions to buy a gift for the recently published book titled "krishna Lord's - Supreme Personality"
 " paul, bhikshu soch ke bina ek lambey samay apane puure purse de di he
 The same day earlier in the evening Paul met the founder Swami Prabhupada, who gave a lecture at the temple
 is baithak se prerit, paul agle din poholyv sir or ek nausikhia bhikshu
 Soon Paul accompanied another monk to Bristol, desiring to open there ISKCON temple
 At first they used to live hippie friends in homes, performing daily program propovidnychi
 Soon they joined some new kryshnayitiv and they opened a small house in Cardiff
 After that, Paul spent some time in London and was then sent to Paris as his speech in French
 ek paris carch main, vah ek bawarchi ke rup main seva, dainik prihotavlivaya prasad or unki rozvozyachy kryshnayity ki sabhi din kendriya paris kii sadakon par kharch hataa diya

 After some time in Cardiff, kryshnayitiv new building appeared and they asked Prabhavishnu back and preached to help them
 Then there is the British kryshnayitiv idea of the first group to travel in Europe for the distribution of spiritual literature and vayshnavskoy offerings

 Prabhavishnu went to Ireland in 1973 and opened the first house there ISKKON
 He then returned to England, where he first became the president of the Church in London and - a few months later - in menorah-bhaktivedanta
 While he continued traveling and campaigning, vayshnavskuyu relihiznuyu spread the literature
 All gathered under his leadership core group kryshnayitiv was preaching in Britain

 Shortly before his death in 1977, Prabhupada called Prabhavishnu and gave him the final instruction "to a British famous Indian poet who lived in London, as he said:" You gave courage and the heart of the English knight Bengali mother 
 At the time, the British expanded their empire around the world
 So you spread the worldly heroic Bengali mother of heroism and heart to the worldwide empire of Krishna consciousness

 Eucalyptus can have many meanings: - dhruvan anuprastha tarangon kaa gun he jo unke dolanon kii disha se sambandhit he
 Dhruva means 'fixed'
 dhruvit tarang main kisi simit rup main hi dolan hote hai jabaki adhruvit tarang main sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se dolan hota he
 The moving sound waves in a gas or liquid do not exhibit the properties of polarization because they have the same direction of motion and the direction of oscillation
 saadhaaran prakaash kii kiran sancharandisha ke saapeksh samamit hoti he, kintu vishesh avasthaaon main usamen asamamiti athwa ekapaksheeyata kaa gun utpann ho jaataa he
 This can be easily evidenced by a green natural crystal plaque called tourmaline
 jab saadhaaran prakaash is pattica main hokar nikalataa he, tab to pattica ke kiran ke aksh par ghumaane se kiran kii tivrata main koi parivartan nahin hota, kintu jab taramaileen main se nikali hui yah kiran tourmaileen kii waisi hi duusari pattica ko ghumaane se kiran kii tivrata main bahut adhik parivartan hota he
 The intensity is maximum when the axes of both tourmalines are parallel
 jyon-jyon in akshon ke bich kaa kone badhata jaataa he tyon-tyon tivrata ghatati jaati he or jab vah samakon ke baraabar ho jaataa he tab tivrata kaa maan shunya ho jaataa he
 It is clear that ascending from the first tourmaline, the light has produced such an asymmetry property that was not in ordinary light
 is gun kaa naam "dhruvan" he or is gunayukta prakaash ko "dhruvit" kehete hai
 From this point of view, ordinary light is called "overflow"
 vyatikaran tathaa vivartan kii ghatnaon ke dwaara spasht ho jaataa he ki dhwani kii tarah hi prakaash kaa sancharan bhi tarangon ke rup main hota he or is sancharan ke liye madhyam ke rup main ether naamak ek padaarth kii kalpana bhi kar lee gai he
 The above phenomenon of polarization proves that light waves are not as longitudinal as sound waves, as the above type of asymmetry is not possible due to the direction of vibration transmission in longitudinal waves
 at: prakaash tarangen anuprastha hoti hai, arthath unke kampan sitar ke taar ke companon kii tarah tarangasancharan se samakonik disha main hote hai
 It is not necessary that the vibrational path of the particle of the medium in the transverse wave is simply linear
 aavashyak itnaa hi he ki kampanpath us samtal main avasthit rahe jisapar tarangasancharan kii disha abhilamb rup ho
 Therefore, the shape of this vibrator can be elliptical and circular in special cases
 jis tarang main kampan kii akruti or yadi kampan saral rekhaatmak ho to uski disha, aparivartin rahati he, use dhruvit tarang kehete hai or jisamen yah akruti yaa disha badalati rahati he use adhruvit kehete hai
 In this view, polarized light can be of the following three types: 1
 samtal dhruvit 2
 Ellipse Polarized 3
 vrutt dhruvit 
 It is known from mathematical studies that these different shapes of vibrations are obtained by combining two right-angled simple periodic vibrations
 vipareetat: kampan kii akruti jo bhi ho, uske vighatan se do samakonik saral aavart kampan praapt ho sakate hai
 When the light enters a transparent crystal, such vibrations of its vibrations take place directly and two flat polar rays appear in the crystal
 inke kampan paraspar samakonik hote hai
 Generally they move in different directions and their velocities are not equal
 is ghatana kaa naam dwivartan he or isi ke dwaara higenz ne san 1960 main dhruvan kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 One of these two rays is absorbed into the crystal of tourmaline
 tourmaileen ke dwaara dhruvit prakaash kii utpatti kaa yahi kaaran he
 The direction of vibrations of this light depends on the direction of the crystalline axis of the tourmaline plate and rotating that plate also changes the direction of the vibrations
 kintu saadhaaran adhruvit prakaash main companon kii akruti athwa dish kshan-kshan main nirantar badalati rahati he, at: jab vah tourmaileen main se nikalataa he tab dhruvit prakaash kii tivrata bhi badalati to rahati he parantu uskaa ausat maan tourmaileen kii prayek sthiti main baraabar rahata he or yahi hamen dikhaai detaa he
 But when flat polarized light, which has amplitude, passes through the tourmaline, it remains polarized, but its amplitude decreases, where is the pointer angle of the tourmaline position
 q = 0 tab samajha jaataa he jab aayam mahattam hota he
 When q = 90 °, the amplitude becomes a = 0 and the transmitted light is lost, no matter how large the amplitude value of the incident light
 dirghavritt dhruvit prakaash ko bhi tourmaileen samtal dhruvit to kar detaa he or uski tivrata bhi tourmaileen ko ghumaane se badhati he, kintu uskaa purnat: lop kabhi nahin hota
 The reason for this is that this type of incident light consists of two components of mutually right, but different dimensions, and when one element is greatest in the case of q = 0, the other is lost and q = 90 degrees
 When the first dimension is omitted, the second dimension becomes the maximum
 vrutt dhruvit prakaash kii tivrata main tourmaileen kuch bhi parivartan nahin kar saktaa, kyonki iske donon avyav companon ke aayam baraabar hote hai arthath 
 Hence, it also has the property of symmetry like unfiltered light
 phir bhi yah dhruvit prakaash he
 The trick to identify it will be explained further
 isamen kampan saral rekhaatmak hote hai or unki disha achar rahati he
 Hence, it is also called line polarization
 samtal dhruvit naam kaa kaaran yah hai ki aise prakaash kii kiran ke samast vinduon ke kampan ek hi samtal main hote hai
 Other measures to generate flat polarized light are as follows: 1

 But the two prisms cut from the calcite special tip are connected to the Canadian balsam to form a parallel fruit prism, known as nickel prism

 Polaroid - In this, microscopic crystals of a mineral called hierapathite are deposited in a parallel position between the two planks of the celluloid in a special way, so that they can all work together to form one long broad crystal

 This is called a polyroid

 Reflection - In 1810, Malus testified that the properties of polarization are found partially in the reflected light from the surface of a transparent material such as water or glass, and it becomes perfectly flat when the incidence angle is of particular value
 
 is aapatan kone ko "dhruvak kone" kehete hai
 According to Brewster's rule, if the polar angle is i and the reflector of the reflective material is m, then sp

 patticganj - yadhyapi kaach kii pattica se dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash purnat: dhruvit hota he, tathaapi us main se pargamit prakaash kabhi bhi purnat: dhruvit nahin hota, vah keval anshat: dhruvit hota he, kintu uttarottar anek patticoon main se pargamit prakaash kaa dhruvan uttarottar badhata jaataa he or patticoon kii sankhya paryaapt ho jane par vah lagbhag purnat: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he
 Such a group of many thin strips is called pattikapunj

 prakirnan - jab prakaash kisi paardarshee madhyam main upasthit atyant chote-chote kanon par padataa he tab un kanon se prakirnit hokar chaaron ore failanevaala prakaash bhi saamanyat: anshadhruvit hota he
 But the light which is radiated in a right-angled direction from the primary ray is perfectly flat
 yah baat akaash ke nile prakaash main dekhi ja sakati he, jo vaayu ke anuon dwaara prakirnit surya kaa prakaash hi he
 Just as it is used to find out whether a light plane is polar or not and which is its polar surface, tourmaline is used, in the same way all the above mentioned means of generating polarization were also used for this purpose
 can go
 ise utpann karne kaa upaay yah he ki samtal dhruvit prakaash ko kisi dwivartak crystal, yatha abhrak kii pattica, par abhilambat: daalaa jaataa he
 This causes right-angled polar rays of two different dimensions to move in the crystal on the same path at different velocities
 usamen se duusari ore nikalne par in donon kirnon main kuch kalantar utpann ho jaataa he or donon ke sangyojan se dirghavritt dhruvit prakaash praapt ho jaataa he
 If the thickness of the crystal plaque is such that the time interval reaches 90 degrees, then the plate is called the quadrant wave plate
 is pattica ko ghumaane se ek kiran kaa aayam badhata he or duusari kaa ghatata he
 In the case where the two dimensions are equal, the transmitted light becomes circled
 aise dhruvanon kii pahchaan ke liye bhi chaturthaansh tarangapattica kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This decomposes the ellipsoidal or circular vibrations into two right-angled simple linear vibrations, and by rotating the fillet to the proper position, it reduces or increases their time point to 0 ° or 180 °
 at: pargamit prakaash pun: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he, jisaki pahchaan tourmaileen yaa nikal ke dwaara ho sakati he
 Flat polarized light cannot be obtained by this action from fractionated or depolarized light, because the fractionated light is a mixture of polar and flat polarized light and the tourmaline gate of the depolarized light can never be omitted
 samtal dhruvit prakaash main companon kii disha kaa gyaan hone kaa karna is disha kaa saket dene ke liye ek dhruvanatal kii kalpana kii gai thi or uski paribhaasha yon di gai thi : paravartan dwaara praapt purnat: samtal dhruvit kiran kaa dhruvanatal uskaa aayaat tal hota he
 Therefore, in the event of a tourmaline in which the intensity of this reflected ray is destroyed, a parallel line is drawn from the emergency floor on the tourmaline plate
 usamen tourmaileen pattica par apaat tal se samaantar rekha khinch lee jaati he or tab aise tourmaileen se kisi bhi dhruvit prakaash kaa dhruvanatal maaloom kiya ja saktaa he
 The simplest way to know this is to move a thin beam of polarized light flattened in a dark room in a vertical direction
 kiran kaa maarg adrishy hi rahegaa, kintu yadi bahut patale kanon kaa dhunaa, kaagaj ko jalaakar, is kiran ke nikat utpann kiya jaae to un kanon se prakirnit prakaash ke kaaran kiran kaa maarg dikhaai dene lagegaa
 But by looking around, the ray will remain invisible in one particular direction
 spashtat: is disha main prakirnan nahin hota
 Thus, this is the direction of vibration, because the transverse wave cannot move in the direction of vibration
 is upaay se gyaat ho gaya he ki kampan kii disha dhruvan tal se samakonik hoti he, arthath dhruvak kone par paravartit kiran ke kampan apaat tal se samakonik hote hai
 The same thing has been proved by other measures
 prakaash ke vidyut chumbakeey siddhant ke anusar prayek kiran main vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey donon prakaar ke kampan hote hai or ye paraspapar samakonik bhi hote hai
 This theory also shows that the electrical vibrations in the reflected light at the polar angle are equidistant from the emergency
 at: isse yah parinaam nikalataa he ki netron ko prabhavit karanevaale prakaash ke kampan vaidyut hai, chumbakeey nahin
 In light reflected at the polar angle, the vibrations of the vibrations are right-angled from the emergency plane, which obviously means that if the vibrations of the incident ray are in the emergency plane, its reflection will not be exactly at the polar angle
 at: jab aapatan kone dhruvak kone ke baraabar ho tab apattal main dhruvit prakaash kaa to paravartan ho saktaa he, kintu apattal se samakonat: dhruvit prakaash kaa paravartan nahin ho saktaa
 In geometry, it is necessary that the intensity of light can be reduced at will and also we can know accurately what is the ratio between this reduced intensity and the preceding intensity
 iske liye do nikal prismon kaa upyog kiya jaat he
 When both are in parallel phase, the intensity of the light passing through both of them progressively becomes the greatest, but if there is an angle between the positions of both, then the intensity decreases in proportion
 polaroid kaa bhi is kaary ke liye upyog kiy ja saktaa he

 The concoction is prepared from leaves of tobacco, garlic and basil; lemon juice, rock salt and bulbs of onion
 The latter items are soaked in the urine from cows which acts as the vehicle in which the active principles in these constituents dissolve
 Over fifty chemical compounds have been identified in CUC
 The major compounds it contains are benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, p-cresol, thymol and nicotine
 The chemical composition and pharmacological cations of the individual components of CUC are also reviewed
 Observations of CUC poisoning in man and experimental animals showed that the main effects of CUC are severe depression of respiration, cardiovascular system, the central nervous system and hypoglycaemia
 These toxic effects acting singly or in combination are believed to be the cause of death from CUC
 Management is geared towards correcting these adverse effects

 The word Brahm is attained
 vihit yajna yagadi ke falswaroop swargadi divya kintu anitya lok sadhate hai parantu karmfal kaa bhoga samaapt hote hi manushya athwa hinatar yoni main jeev jaraamaran ke chakkar main padataa he 
 Seeing the impermanence of the results, be disillusioned with the world, taking initiation from the Brahmastriya Guru and attaining brahmopathi is the ultimate effort of man
 brahm "bhootyoni" he arthath usee se pranimaatr utpann hote or usee main leen hote hai
 This action is not caused by any cosmic element, but as the ejaculatory extracts and swallows the webs from itself, just as drugs and hair come out of the earth and hair and follicles come out of the body, in the same way there is cosmopolitanism from Brahm
 apane anirvachaneey gyanarupi tap se vah kinchit sthool ho jaataa he jisase ann, praan, man, satya, lok, karm, karmfal, hiranyagarbha, namrup, indriyaan, akaash, vaayu, jyoti, jal or pruthivi ityadi utpann hote hai

 The true form of Brahma is avyakta and achintya

 For this, the great weapon of the Upanishads is directed towards the pursuit of selling the goal of Brahmrupi, being attuned to the self-proclaimed arrow that is sharpened by worship on the bow
 isse jeevatma or paramatma ke abhed kaa anubhavatmak gyaan ho jaataa he; hryday kii gaanth khul jaati, sab sanshay mit jate or punya or paap ke bandhan se mukti mil jaati he evam maran kaal main aatma or paramatma ek ho jate hai
 The form of this "monotony" is similar to attaining monotony after the flowing rivers meet in the sea
 dwaitvaadi "ek hi vriksh par sate baithe do pakshi mitron main ek pipal ke mithe-mithe gode khaataa or doosraa takata maatr he" 
 In the mantra, the karma-fruit-bhakta takes the distinct distinction between the soul and the brahm, considering the difference between the two, but with the followings and other mantras and the sentence "brahmveda Brahmav Bhavati", the principle of this Upanishads is derived from Brahmatmakya
