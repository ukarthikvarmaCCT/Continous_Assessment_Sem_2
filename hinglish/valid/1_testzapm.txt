 The Act was originally passed in August 1935 and was called the longest Act of Parliament enacted at that time
 isaki lambaai kii vajah se, pratikriya swaroop bharat sarkaar dwaara adhinium 1935 ko ko do alag-alag adhiniyamon main vibhajit kiya gaya: In literature on Indian political and constitutional history, the reference is generally taken to be a shortened form of the Government of India 1935 Act, rather than being enacted originally as a text of the Act
 adhinium ke sabase mahatvapurn pahalu the: However, the degree of autonomy the introduction of the provincial level was subject to significant limitations: the provincial governor retained significant reserve powers and the British authorities also retained the authority to suspend a responsible government
 adhinium ke kuch hisson kii maang bharat sangh ko sthapit karnaa tha lekin rajasi rajyon ke shaskaon ke virodh ke kaaran kabhi sanchaalan main nahin aayaa
 The remaining part of the Act came into force in 1937 when the first elections were held under the Act
 unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh ke baad se bhartiya logon ne apane desh kii sarkaar main lagaataar badi bhoomika kii maang kii
 The contribution of Indians to the British war effort during World War i meant that the more conservative elements of the British political establishment felt the need for constitutional change and the resulting 1919 Act of the Government of India
 The act introduced a neo system of government known as the provincial "dyarchy", that is, the government of some regions was placed in the hands of ministers responsible for the provincial legislature while others were appointed by the British-appointed provincial governor
 Were held in the hands of the officials responsible for
 jabaki adhinium, bharatiyon dwaara sarkaar main ek badi bhoomika nibhaane kii maang kaa ek pratibimb tha, saath hi bharat kii vyavastha main us bhoomika kaa kya matlab ho saktaa he iske bare main british bhay kaa ek pratibimb tha
 Experiments with dyarchy proved unsatisfactory
 bhartiya netaaon ke liye ek vishesh rup se niraashaa yah hi ki un kshetron main jahaan keval nammaatr kaa niyantran unhone praapt kiya tha, lekin "mukhya adhikaar" british naukarshahi ke haathon main hi tha
 It was intended to review India's constitutional arrangements and those princely states that were ready to accept it
 haalanki, samjhaute ko rokane ke liye congress or muslim pratinidhiyon ke bich vibhaajan karnaa mukhya kaarak sabit hua chunki vyavastha main sangh ke kaam karne kii mahatvapurn jaankaree thi
 Against the system, the new Conservative-dominated national government in London decided to come forward with the drafting of its own proposal
 lord linlithgo kii adhyakshata main ek sanyukt sansadeey chayan samiti ne kaaphi had tak white paper kii samiksha kii
 On the basis of this white paper, the Government of India bill was created
 cameti str or baad main kattarta ko shant kiya gaya, "suraksha" ko majboot kiya gaya or kendriya vidhansabha ke liye apratyaksh chunaav kaa punah aayojan kiya gaya
 The bill was duly passed into law in August 1935
 is prakriya kaa ek parinaam yah he ki, haalanki bhartiya maangon ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke 1935 kii adhinium ko thodaa or aage janaa chahie tha, iskaa masauda saamagree main bill kaa bistaar or bhartiya bhagidaari kii kami donon kaa arth tha ki bharat main sarvshereshth nirutsaah pratikriya ke saath adhinium kaa hona jabaki britain main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke liye yah kattarpanthi sabit hui
 Although it became unusual for the Acts of the British Parliament to include the Preamble, the lack of one from the Government of India Act 1935 contrasted with the Act of 1919, which led to the purpose of that Act relating to it for Indian political development
 Established a comprehensive philosophy
 20 agast 1917 ko house of comons ke liye bharat mantri edwin montagu ke vaktavy par aadhaarit 1919 ke adhinium kii prastaavna uddhrut he, jo vaada karti he: 


 is a gradual development of self-governing institution with a philosophy for the progressive presentation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire
 canada or australia jaise maujuuda dominian ke saath bhartiya maangon main ab british bharat main sanvaidhanik samta ko praapt karnaa tha jiskaa arth tha ki british rashtramandal main sampoorn swaittata
 An important element in the British political circle doubted that Indians were able to run their country on this basis and with sufficient "security", perhaps, the Dominion status as an objective after a long period of gradual constitutional development saw
 unke bich yah tanaav or bhartiya or british ke bheetar drushti ke parinamswaroop 1935 adhinium ke besanga samjhaute ko paaya gaya jisamen isaki koi apni prastaavna nahin thi, lekin 1919 adhinium kii prastaavna ko isaki jagah rakhaa gaya phir bhi us adhinium ke avshesh ko nirast kiya
 It was generally seen in India as more mixed messages from the British, suggesting a defiant attitude on its part and the barest of "minimum essentials" towards satisfying Indian desires
 sabase aadhunik samvidhanon ke vipareet, lekin us samay ke rashtramandal sanvaidhanik kanoon ke saath saamaanya, adhinium ne "adhikaar ke bill" ko nae pranali ke bheetar shaamil nahin kiya jisaki sthapana kaa uddeshy tha
 However, in the proposed case of the Union of India there were some complications involving a set of rights, as the new entity included nominal sovereign princely states
 haalanki kuch logon dwaara ek alag drushtikon ko mana gaya or nehru report main masauda ruparekha samvidhan main bill ke adhikaar ko shaamil kiya gaya
 In 1947, a relatively few amendments to the Act made the Interim Implementation Constitution of India and Pakistan
 adhinium keval atyant vistrut hi nahin tha, lekin yah 'suraksha maanak' ke saath ghira tha, british jimmedaariyon or hiton ko banaae rakhane ke liye jab bhi isaki aavashyaktaa hoti hastkshep karne ke liye british sarkaar ko sakasham banane ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 To meet this goal, the Indian government's institutions are gradually increasing in the face of Indianisation, the decision to use the Act and the actual administration of the security measures in the hands of the British appointed Viceroy and the Provincial Governors who are the Secretary of State for India Was under control
 'vishaal shaktiyon or jimmedaariyon jise governor general apane vivek yaa apane vyaktigat nirnay ke anusaar anushaasan karnaa chahie, yah spasht he ki uske ko superman kii tarah ho jane kii ummid hoti he
 He must be endowed with an infinite capacity for humility, courage and hard work
 "we have inserted many safeguards in this bill" Sir Robert Horn said 


 "but all those safeguards are about the same person i think and she is Viceroy
 vah puri vyavastha kii lynch-pin he
 


 if the Viceroy fails, nothing can save your installed system
 " yah bhaashan drudh torij ke drushtakon ko pratibimbit karti he jo ek din lebar government dwaara viceroy kii niyukti hone kii sambhaavna dwaara bhaybheet tha
 a proper reading of the Act shows that the British Government has prepared it for itself, whenever they feel they could take full control of it at any time with the legal tools
 haalanki, bina kisi sateek kaaran ke aisa karnaa bharat ke samooh ke saath unki vishwasaneeyata samaapt ho jaati jinka uddeshy adhinium ko praapt karnaa tha
 Some odd ideas: "sangheey sarkaar main 


 jimmedaar sarkaar kii ek jhalak prastut kiya he
 But there is a lack of reality, as the case lacks the necessary powers in defense and foreign affairs, the Governor General is necessarily given a threshold for ministerial activity and the measure of representation of Indian states is negative and even That there is no possibility of the introduction of democratic control
 ek atyant vishisht sarkaar ke nirmaan ke vikaas ko dekhne ke liye yah atyant ruchi kii vishay hogi; nishchit rup se, agar yah safaltaapurvak sanchalit hota he, sabase adhik credit bhartiya netaaon kii raajnneetik kshamta ko jayega, jinhone aupniveshik rajaneta kii tulana main adhik gambhir kathinaaiyon kaa saamana kiya he jinhone swayan-sarkaar kii pranali ko viksit kiya tha jo ki ab dominian str main paraakaashtha par he
 " lord lothian ne ek pantalis minute ke lambi baatcheet main is bill ke bare main apane vichaar rakhe hai: "I agree with the surrendered Kattaro
 Those who are not used to any constitution cannot realize what great powers they have to use
 yadi aap is samvidhan ko dekhenge to aisa lagegaa ki sabhi shaktiyaan governor general or rajyapal main nihit he
 But here the whole power is not vested in the king? Everything is done in the name of the king, but does the king ever interfere in it? Once power falls into the hands of the legislature, the governor or the governor general never intervene

 The impropriety of this arrangement is evident when the status of British capital in an Indian modern region is given greater prominence and total dominance, the impropriety is maintained through the commercial system, the UK in both India's international and coastal shipping traffic Removal of shipping interests and Indian capital in the UK without value and Indians in shipping within the UK Sector is the non-existence

 Thus the involuntary conditional concessions of power in the Acts of 1919 and 1935 caused more dissatisfaction and failed to win the rule of influential groups in India which were desperately needed

 'at that time the balance of power in the conservative party was considered, the enactment passed in 1935 was unthinkable compared to passing the bill

 However, intervention by the British governor intensified the paternal threat was done

 a monofin is a type of swim fin that consists of two shells in a single large fin with the swimmer or beggar putting both feet
 aam taur se tairne ke do fin hua karte hai jo donon taangon-pairon ko alag-alag hilne dete hai, lekin monophin main ek hi fin hone kii vajah se tairaak ke donon pair or taange ek hi saath hilaate hai

 Swimming knees with monofin are used at a low level, and the thrust is applied by lifting the hips up and down
 yah tairne kaa tareeqa dolphin ke tairne ke tareeqe se miltaa julata he or isamen dhire-dhire jor lagane par bhi monophin se aage kii ore tairne kaa kaafii dhakka lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This is very beneficial in the free dowry that is done without the arrangement of air because even if you swim slowly, you can swim for long enough without breathing

 abhigyaan shaakuntalam mahakavi kalidas kaa vishwavikhyath naatak he jiskaa anuwaad praaia: sabhi videshi bhashaaon main ho chukaa he
 It has a beautiful story of love, marriage, marriage, reprisal and reunion of King Dushyant and Shakuntala
 puranic katha main dushyant ko akashwani dwaara bodh hota he par is naatak main kavi ne mudrika dwaara iskaa bodh karaayaa he
 Its theatricality, its beautiful narratives, its poetic-aesthetic analogies, and the periodic notes used from place to place; And above all, the acoustics of the diverse episodes are so amazing that even Sanskrit dramas cannot compete with Abhigyan Shakuntal when viewed from these points of view; Then what to say about other languages! So this is the best thing here
 kalidas ne abhigyaan shaakuntal kii kathavstu moulik nahin chuni
 This story is derived from the Adiparva of the Mahaharata
 yon padmapurana main bhi shakuntla kii katha milti he or vah mahabharat kii apeksha shakuntala kii katha ke adhik nikat he
 For this reason, Winternitz has assumed that the story of Shakuntala is derived from Padmapurana
 parantu vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki padmapurana kaa yah bhaag shakuntala kii rachana ke baad likhaa or baad main prakshipt prathit hota he
 The curse of Durvasa is not mentioned in the Mahabharata story
 mahabharat kaa dushyant se yadi thik ulataa nahin, to bhi bahut adhik bhinn he
 Shakuntala of Mahabharata is not as well-groomed as that of Kalidasa
 vah dushyant ko vishwamitra or menka ke sambandh ke falswarup hue apane janm kii katha apane munh se hi sunaati he
 In the Mahabharata, Dushyant, enchanted by the appearance of Shakuntala, prays Gandharva marriage to Shakuntala; On which Shakuntala says that i can marry on the condition that the throne be given to my son only
 dushyant us samay to sweekaar kar letaa he or baad main apni rajdhani main lautakar jaan-boojhkar lajjawash shakuntala ko grahan nahin karata
 Kalidasa has refined the narrative thus received in unsophisticated form to his imagination
 durvasa ke shaap kii kalpana karke unhone dushyant ke charitra ko ooncha uthaaya he
 Shakuntala of Kalidasa is also an idol of nobility, beauty and compassion
 iske atirikt kalidas ne sari katha kaa nirvaah, bhaavon kaa chithran ityadi jis dhang se kiya he, vah moulik or apurv he
 Shakuntala was the wife of King Dushyant who was the mother of India's well-known king Bharata and the daughter of Maneka Apsara
 mahabharat main likhaa he ki shankutala kaa janm menka apsara ke garbh se hua tha jo ise van main chhodkar chali gai thi
 It was named Shakuntala by the Shankutas etc
 in the forest which protected it from predatory animals
 van main se ise kanv rishi uthaa laae the or apane ashram main rakhkar kanya ke samaan paalate the
 Once King Dushyant went out to hunt with some soldiers with him and roamed the ashram of Kanva Rishi
 rishi us samay vahaan upasthit nahin the; isse yuvati shakuntla ne hi raja dushyant kaa aatithy satkar kiya
 On the same occasion, the two married Prem and then Gandharva
 kuch dinon baad raja dushyant vahaan se apane rajya ko chale gaye
 When Kanva Muni came back, he was very happy to know that Shakuntala was married to Dushyant
 shakuntla us samay garbhvatee ho chuki thi
 With time, a very powerful and bright son was born from her womb, named 'bharata'
 kehete hai, 'bharat' naam 'bharat' ke naam par hi padaa
 a few days later Shakuntala took her son to Dushyant's court
 parantu shakuntla ko bich main durvasa rishi kaa shaap mil chukaa tha
 The king did not recognize it at all and said clearly that neither i know you nor can you give me shelter here
 parantu isi avasar par ek akashwani hui, jisase raja ko vidit hua ki yah meri hi patni he or yah putr bhi meraa hi he
 He remembered all the things about Kanva Muni's ashram and kept Shakuntala as his head queen
 ‘abhigyaan shaakuntalam’ main anek maarmik prasangon ko ullekh kiya gaya he
 One, when Dushyant and Shakuntala meet for the first time
 doosraa us samay, jab kanv shakuntala ko apane ashram se patigrih ke liye vidaa karte hai
 At that time, the sage himself says that if a sage like me has this fascination in his parents, then what will be the situation of those whose daughters are leaving for the house
 teesraa prasang he, shakuntala kaa dushyant kii sabha main upasthit hona or dushyant ko usko pahchaanane se inkaar karnaa
 The fourth episode is of the time when a ring with the name of Dushyant received by the fisherman is shown to him
 or paanchvaan prasang marichi maharishi ke ashram main dushyant-shakuntala ke milan kaa
 The greatest miracle of Kalidasa in Shakuntala is in his phonetic signs
 isamen kavi ko vilakshan safalataa yah mili he ki usne kahin bhi koi bhi vastu nishprayojan nahin kahi
 No character, any narrative statement, any incident, no natural scene is useless
 sabhi ghatnaayen yah drishy aage aane vaali ghatnaon kaa sanket chamatkaarik reeti se pehle hi de dete hai
 In the beginning of the play, while narrating the summer, the story of the drama was broadly communicated by feeling fragrant, falling asleep and lying in the shadows and being delightful at the end of the day, with the fragrance of the forest floor
 Has gone, indicating the meeting of Shakuntala and Dushyant respectively, then forgetting Shakuntala with sleep-effects and ending the play with pleasure
 isi prakaar naatak ke praarambhik geet main bhramaron dwaara shiris ke phulon ko zaraa-zaraa-sa chuumane se yah sanket miltaa he ki dushyant or shakuntala kaa milan alpasthayee hoga
 Some ascetics stop coming when the king is running after the stag with an arrow on the bow
 kehete hai-‘maharaj’ yah ashram kaa harin he, is par tir na chalaanaa
 'in addition to the stag here, there is also a hint towards Shakuntala, who is naive and helpless like the stag
 ‘kahaan to harinon kaa atyant chanchal jivan or kahaan tumhaare vajra ke samaan kathor baan !’ isse bhi shakuntala kii asahaayta or saralata tathaa raja kii nishthurataa kaa marmasparshi sanket kiya gaya he
 When the love of Dushyanta and Shakuntala begins to grow a bit, then the cry from the back is heard saying, "tapaswiyo, get ready to protect the creatures of the ashram
" shikari raja dushyant yahaan aayaa hua he
 'there also appears to have been a hint of the defense of Shakuntala from Dushyant's hands, but this signal was not heard in anyone's ear; Nobody saved Shakuntala
 isse sthiti kii karunajanakta or bhi adhik bad jaati he
 In the early part of the fourth issue, the disciple of Kanva while describing Prabhat mentioned the constant association of happiness and sorrow and unbearable grief of women in the separation of the beloved, before Dushyanta abandoned Shakuntala
 Makes the background-c from itself
 paanchaven ank main rani hansapadika ek geet gaati hai, jisamen raja ko unki madhur-vritti ke liye ulaahna diya gaya he
 Dushyanta also confesses that he has loved Hanspadika only once
 isse kavi yah gambheer sanket detaa he ki bhale hi shakuntala ko dushyant ne durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran bhuulakar choda, parantu ek baar pyaar karne ke baad raniyon kii upeksha karnaa unke liye koi nai baat nahin thi
 Other queens were also victims of this sweet attitude
 hansapadika ke is geet kii prishthbhumi main shakuntala ke parityag kii ghatana or bhi krur or kathor jaan padati he
 By similar phonetic gestures, Kalidasa has set a pleasant backdrop for Dushyant, Shakuntala and his son in the seventh issue
 indra raja dushyant ko apurv sammaan pradaan karte hai
 After that, upon reaching Hemkut mountain, Prajapati's ashram, the king starts feeling as if he is bathing in the lake of nectar
 is prakaar ke sanketon ke baad dushyant or shakuntala kaa milan or bhi adhik manohar ho uthta he
 German poet Goethe had said about Abhigyan Shakuntalam- isi prakaar sanskrit ke vidwaanon main yah shloke prasiddh he- This means - Among all the forms of poetry, drama is particularly beautiful
 naatakon main bhi kavy-soundarya kii drushti se abhigyaan shaakuntalan kaa naam sabase upar he
 Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top
 abhigyaan shaakuntalan main bhi uskaa chaturth ank or is ank main bhi chauthaa shloke to bahut hi romantic he
 In Abhigyan Shakuntal, there is a considerable amount of poetry as well as a portion of poetry
 isamen shringaar mukhya ras he; or uske sanyog tathaa viyog donon hi pakshon kaa paripaak sundar rup main hua he
 Apart from this, there is good expression of humor, valor and Karun Ras
 sthaan-sthaan par sundar or manoharini utprekshaayen na keval pathak ko chamatkrit kar detii hai, kintu abhisht bhav kii tivrata ko badhaane main hi sahaayak hoti hai
 In all the plays, Kalidas did not use his similes and motivations for mere ornamentation
 prayek sthaan par unki upama yaa utpreksha arth kii abhivyakti ko raspurn banane main sahaayak hui he
 Kalidas is famous in Sanskrit literature for his similes
 shaakuntal main bhi unki upyukt upama chunane kii shakti bhalee-bhaanti prakat hui
 In one place about Shakuntala, King Dushyant says that 'it is a flower that no one has smelled; Such is the Navapallava, which does not scratch anyone's fingernails; There is a gem, which is not pierced and there is a honey, which no one has tasted
 ’ in upamaaon ke dwaara shakuntala ke saundarya kii ek anokhi jhalak hamaari ankhon ke saamne aa jaati he
 Similarly, in the fifth issue Dushyanta abandons Shakuntala, saying, "O Tapaswini, do you want to tarnish your clan and impure me, like a river that breaks the coast and falls down the tree of the shore and It also taps its water
 ’ yahaan shakuntala kii chat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi se di gai upama raja ke manobhaav ko vyakt karne main vishesh rup se sahaayak hoti he
 Similarly, when Kanva's disciples take Shakuntala and reach Dushyant, Dushyant's vision falls on the Shakuntala among those ascetics
 vahaan shakuntala ke saundarya kaa vistrut varnan na karke kavi ne unke mukh se keval itnaa kahalava diya he ki ‘in tapasviyon ke bich main vah ghunghat vaali sundari koun he, jo pile patton ke bich main nai konpal ke samaan dikhaai pad rahi he
 'this small upma has depicted the beauty of Shakuntala by the goodness of the yellow leaves and the buds
 isi prakaar sarvadman ko dekhakar dushyant kehete hai ki ‘yah pratapi balak us agni ke sphuling kii bhaanti prathit hota he, jo dadhakati aag banane ke liye idhan kii raah dekhtaa he
 With this upma, Kalidas not only revealed the brilliance of the child, but has also clearly conveyed that this child will grow up to become the glorious Chakravarti emperor
 is prakaar kii manohar upamaaon ke anek udhaaharan shaakuntal main se diye ja sakate hai kyonki shaakuntal main 180 upamaayen prayukt huin hai
 And all of them surpass one by one
 yah thik he upama ke chunaav main kalidas ko vishesh kushalta praapt thi or yah bhi thik he ki unki-si sundar upmaayen anya kaviyon kii rachanaaon main durlabh hai, phir bhi kalidas kii sabase badi visheshta upama-kaushal nahin he
 Upma-kaushal is a common part of his poetry skills
 apane manobhaav ko vyakt karne athwa kisi ras kaa paripaak karne athwa kisi bhav kii teevr anubhuti ko jagaane kii kalidas anek vidhiyaan jaanate hai
 Kalidas has made his style particularly delightful by using a contextual selection of words, choosing the appropriate verses of the desired sense and using euphemism
 jahaan kalidas shakuntala ke soundarya-varnan par utre hai, vahaan unhone keval upamaaon or utprekshaon dwaara shakuntala kaa rup chithran karke hi santosh nahin kar liya he
 At first, he merely said that 'if there is so much form among the residents of Tapovan, then understand that the forest vines beat the vines of the garden
 ’ phir dushyant ke mukh se unhone kahalwaya ki ‘itani sundar kanya ko ashram ke niyam-paalan main lagaana aisa hi he jaise nil camel kii pankhuri se babul kaa ped kaatna
 'after that, Kalidas says that' Shakuntala's form is so beautiful that even though she is wearing a thick vulcanic cloth, then her beauty is not reduced to anything, but it has increased
 kyonki sundar vyakti ko jo bhi kuch pahana diya jaae vahi uskaa aabhushan ho jaataa he
 'he then compares Sukumar's body of King Shakuntala with the green flower-laden Lata, so that the image of that unique beauty is painted in front of the reader's eyes
 iske baad us saundarya kii anubhuti ko charam seemaa par pahunchane ke liye kalidas ek bhramar ko le aae hai; jo shakuntala ke mukh ko ek sundar khilaa hua phool samajhakar uskaa rasapan karne ke liye uske upar mandaraane lagata he
 Thus, Kalidasa did not take the support of the antlers to portray the beauty of Shakuntala as much as the euphemism; And this cuisine is considered to be the life of poetry

 The smallest compact cameras are generally described as subcompact or "ultra-compact" with a thickness of less than 20 mm
 compact camaron ko aam taur par is tarah dizin kiya jaataa he ki unka prayog karnaa saral ho, unase unnat kism kii suvidhaayen praapt ho sake or unke tasveeron kii gunvattta, compact or saral ho; aam taur par iske chitron ko keval losi compresssont kaa prayog karke hi sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he

 chunki frem karne ke dauraan imager tak prakaash nahin pahunch paata he isliye darpan box main vishisht sensoron kaa prayog karke autofocus ko karyanvit kiya jaataa he
 Most DSLR cameras of the 21st century also have a "live view" mode that, when selected, stimulates the live preview system of compact cameras with data
 anya prakaar ke camaron kii apeksha in camaron ke sensoron kaa aakaar bahut bada hota he jinka vikarn aam taur par 18 mm se 36 mm tak hota he

 The Rangefinder is a user-operated optical system used to measure the distance of objects that were once used in film cameras
 adhikansh digital camere, dhvanik yaa electronic takaneeq kaa prayog karke apane aap vastu kii duuri maap lete hai lekin yah kahana uchit nahin hoga ki unamem rangefinder he
 The noun rangefinder also sometimes means a rangefinder camera, that is, a film camera equipped with a rangefinder that is different from slrs or ordinary cameras that do not have the ability to measure distances
 line-scan camera, ek aisa camera upkaran he jisamen ek line-scan image sensor chip or ek fokasing kriyavali hoti he
 These cameras are often used only to capture images of the continuous flow of a moving object in industrial locations
 video camaron ke vipareet, line-scan camaron main unke metrics ke bajaay pixel sensoron kii ek saarini kaa prayog hota he
 a line-scan camera's data consists of a frequency under which the camera scans, waits, and repeats a line

 However, with rapid development, the gap between mainstream compact digital cameras and camera phones is now gradually narrowing and competition between high-powered camera phones of the same generation and low-level automated digital cameras continues 
 jab digital camere aam ho gaye, tab kai photographeron kaa ek hi sawaal tha ki kya unke film camaron ko digital main roopantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 The answer was yes and no
 The answer is for most 35mm film cameras - no, because it will need to be reworked and will cost too much, especially with a lot of work going into developing lenses as well as cameras and its The cost will also be very high
 In most cases of converting cameras to digital, replacing the rear of the camera would require replacement of a custom built digital unit to make enough room for electronics and preview through a liquid crystal display
 35 mm film camaron se kai aarambhik vyavhaarik SLR camaron jaise - NC2000 or kodak DCS shrinkhalaa ko viksit kiya gaya
 However, based on the technology of the time, the rear of these cameras were larger and heavier units than the almost camera portion, rather than being digital "backs"

 To summarize, it was a video movie camera that recorded single frames, 50 per disc in field mode and 25 per disc in frame mode
 iske chitron kii gunvattta ko tatkaaleen-vartmaan televisionon ke chitron kii gunvattta ke samaan mana gaya
 These analog electronic cameras did not manage to hit the market until 1986 with the Canon RC-701
 Canon demonstrated a prototype of this model at the 1984 Summer Olympics and printed these pictures in a Japanese newspaper called Yomiuri Shimbun
 sanyukt rajya america main, sabase pehle USA today ke world series besabaal ke kawarej main vaastavik vistrut-soochna ke prakaashan ke liye in camaron kaa prayog kiya gaya
 There were several reasons behind the widespread adoption of these analog cameras; Cost, poor picture quality compared to film cameras, and lack of quality cheap printers
 To actually take and print pictures, the presence of equipment such as frame grabber was beyond the reach of the average consumer

 The first true digital camera to record images as a computerized file was probably the 1988 Fuji DS-1P which recorded images in a 16 MB internal memory and used a battery to store data in this memory Gone
 is camere ko sanyukt rajya america ke bazaar main kabhi nahin laayaa gaya or iske japan main bheje jane kii bhi pushti nahin hui he
 The first commercially available digital camera was the 1990 DYCAM Model 1; It was also sold as Logitech Photoman

 Nikon F-mount lenses were also used in this camera, which meant that film photographers could use many of the same lenses that they already had
 ek digital camere ke rizolushan ko praayah camere ke sensor dwaara seemaabaddh kiya jaataa he jo paaramparik photography main film ke kaam kaa sthaan-parivartan karke prakaash ko asatat sanketon main badal detaa he
 The sensor is made up of millions of "buckets" that essentially count the number of photons that affect the sensor
 iskaa matlab yah he ki sensor ke nirdisht bindu par kaa chitra jitna zyada chamkila hota he, uskaa maan utana hi adhik hota he jo us pixel ke liye prastut hota he
 Depending on the physical structure of the sensor, a color filter table may be used that requires a demosaicing / interpolation algorithm
 chitra ke parinami pickselon kii sankhya, iske "pixel gananaa" kaa nirdhaaran karti he
 For example, a 640x480 image would have 307,200 pixels, or about 307 kilopixels; a 3872x2592 image will have 10,036,224 pixels, or about 10 megapixels
 keval pixel gananaa ko aam taur par kisi camere ke rizolushan kaa sanket mana jaataa he lekin yah ek galat dharna he
 There are several factors that affect the resolution of the sensor

atyadhik pixel maujuud hone ke kaaran kai digital compact camaron kii aalochana kii gai he
 The censors, so small that their 'buckets', can easily perfect them; In turn, the resolution of the sensor can be relatively large, which is hardly achievable with the camera lens

 Since only a few aspect ratios are typically used, the number of useful sizes of sensors is limited
 iske alaava, sensor-nirmaataa, prayek sambhavit sensor aakaar kaa nirmaan nahin karte hai lekin aakaaron main vruddhi karne ke liye aavashyak kadam uthaate hai
 For example, in 2007 there were three large sensors used by Canon - 21
1, 16
6 and 12
8 megapixel CMOS sensors
 The following is the table of sensors used in digital cameras: jab se digital back kii shuruuaat hui, tab se image ko capchar karne ke liye mukhya teen vidhiyon ko prayog main laayaa jaataa he jinamein se prayek, sensor or color filtaron ke hardware concigareshan par aadhaarit he
 The first method is often called single-shot, which relates to the number of times the camera's sensor is exposed to the light passing through the camera lens
 single-shot capchar pranaaliyon main yaa to bear filter mosek vaale ek CCD kaa prayog hota he yaa teen alag-alag image sensoron kaa prayog hota he jo ek beam splitre ke madhyam se usee chitra ke samaksh pradarshit hote hai
 The second method is referred to as multi-shot because the sensor is displayed in front of the image in a sequence of three or more orifices of the lens-hole
 multi-shot takaneeq ke anuprayog kii kai vidhiyaan hai
 Originally under the simplest method, a single image sensor with three filters passing through the sensor was used in order to obtain summative color information
 multiple shot kii ek duusari vidhi kaa naam microscanning he
 a single CCD with a bare filter is used under this technique, but in fact the physical state of the sensor chip is shifted to the focus plane of the lens so that it can be "stitched" with a higher resolution image
 Otherwise CCD would be implemented
 Combining these two methods created a third version that did not require a bare filter on the chip
 teesri vidhi ko scanning kehete hai kyonki sensor, sampurna focal plane main zyaadaatar usee tarah chalata he jis tarah ek desktop scinar kaa sensor chalata he
 Their linear or tri-linear sensors use only one category of photosensors or three ranges for three colors
 kuch maamalon main, sensor chalaakar udaahranarth, color ko-site namoonay kaa prayog karke yaa puure camere ko ghumaakar, scanning ke kaam ko anzaam diya jaataa he; ek digital rotating line camera, ucch koti kii rizolushan vaale chitra pradaan karata he
 The selection of a method for a given capture is mainly determined by the content
 aise kisi vastu ko capchar karne kii koshish karnaa aam taur par anuchit hota he jo kisi chiz balki ek single-shot pranali ke saath chalata he
 However, high color fidelity and large-sized file and multi-shot access make it attractive for commercial photographers to work with available resolution and scanning back, stationery items and large-sized format photographs

 Digital cameras require more power or power and over time they have become smaller in size resulting in the need to develop a battery small enough to fit into the camera, increasing day by day and also It is also necessary to have the power or power to flow in it for a reasonable period of time
 digital camaron ke liye khaas taur par do prakaar kii badariyon kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 The first type of battery for digital cameras conforms to an installed off-the-shelf form factor, the most common of which are AA, CR2 or CR-V3 batteries, and along with a handful of The cameras use AAA batteries
 CR2 or CR-V3 batariyaan, lithium par aadhaarit hoti hai or ekal prayog ke vichaar se nirmit hoti hai
 They have also been commonly seen in camcorders
 AA batariyaan, sabase aam taur par prayukt hone vaali batariyaan hai; haalanki, nimna-stareey camaron ke saath aapurt gaiyr-richargeble alkaline batariyaan, adhikansh camaron main sirf kuch samay ke liye paryaapt shakti pradaan karne main sakasham hoti hai
 They can serve satisfactorily in cameras that are only occasionally used

 In particular, mid-range consumer models and some low-level cameras use off-the-shelf batteries; Only a few DSLR cameras accept them
 Rechargeable RCR-V3 lithium-ion batteries are also available as an alternative to non-rechargeable CR-V3 batteries
 digital camaron ke liye bydaree kaa doosraa prakaar, swaamitvayukt bydaree praaroop he
 These are made to the manufacturer's custom specifications and may be either aftermarket replacement parts or OEM

 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort's magical knowledge is far greater than any living sorcerer, and that even with Voldemort's return to full power, Dumbledore's knowledge of having the most powerful defense spells in front of his spells would be insufficient

 abhijatatantr vah shashantantr he jisamen raajnneetik satta abhijan ke haath main ho
 "abhijana" in this context means noble, scholar, virtuous, noble
 pashchim main "aristocraisi" kaa arth bhi lagbhag yahi he
 Aflatoon and his disciple Aristotle in his books consider Aristacracy as the rule of intelligent, virtuous persons
 abhijatatantr kaa ullekh praaia: anek deshon ke itihaas main miltaa he
 Scholars believe that India also had some aristocrats in ancient times

 For these philosophers, Aflatoon has arranged communic and property-related communism
 rajyadarshan ke itihaas main dhaniktantr ko bhi kabhi-kabhi abhijatatantr mana gaya he
 There are two reasons for this
 pratham, donon main shashansatta ek vyakti yaa samast vayask nagarikon ke haath main na hokar thode se vyaktiyon ke haath main hoti he
 Secondly, some believe that only Dhanasanchaya can do Charatrivaan and thus he is an expression of virtue
 anek aadhunik samajashastriyon kaa mat he ki rajtantr or janatantr main bhi vastav main samprabhutaa thode se vyaktiyon ke hi haath main hoti he
 The king has to depend on the help of shrewd politicians for governance
 janatantr main bhi praaia: saamaanya janata ko raajnneeti main ruchi nahin hoti, vah anugami hoti he
 The reins of governance are also in the hands of clever politicians in a democracy and they are rich
 vaastavik raajnneetik prakriya main jo sanmpann hai, vahi chatur hai, vahi raajnneetijna hai, prashasan or raajnneetik dalbandi main unheen kaa sikaa chalata he
 But how to appoint an elite? If by public election, it is a kind of democracy
 yadi anya kisi prakaar se, to abhijan shashan sankeern, swaarthee, durvinith or dhanpriya ho jate hai or apni kshamta ko parivartit paristhiti ke anuroop nahin rakh pate
 Today, the main problem of democracy and aristocracy is that somehow the incremental effect of money in the state should be resolved and the public should choose the wise service persons as their ruler

 Bhojeshwar Temple is a temple built in a village named Bhojpur, about 30 km from Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh
 ise bhojpur mandir bhi kehete hai
 This temple is situated on a hill between the Vindhya ranges on the banks of the Betwa River
 mandir kaa nirmaan evam iske shivlinga kii sthapana dhar ke prasiddh parmaar raja bhoj ne karavaayi thi
 It is also called Bhojpur Temple or Bhojeshwar Temple after his name, though according to some legends the original temple of this place is believed to have been established by the Pandavas
 ise "uttar bharat kaa somnath" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The inscriptions here give a knowledge of the architecture of the 11th century Hindu temple construction and it is known that the dome was used even before the arrival of Islam in India
 is apurna mandir kii vrahat kaary yojana ko nikatavarti pashaan shilaon par ukera gaya he
 According to these map diagrams, there was a plan to build a large temple complex in which many other temples were also to be built
 iske safaltapurvak sampann ho jane par ye mandir parisar bharat ke sabase bade mandir parisaron main se ek hota
 The temple complex has been marked as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India and has made a successful effort to revive it by renovating it
 mandir ke baahar lage puraatatva vibhaag ke shilaalekh anusaar is mandir kaa shivlinga bharat ke mandiron main sabase unchaa evam vishaltam shivlinga he
 The entrance of this temple is also the largest among the doors of any Hindu building
 mandir ke nikat hi is mandir ko samarpit ek puraatatva sangrahalay bhi bana he
 The Bhojpur festival is organized every year by the state government on the occasion of Shivaratri
 is mat ke anusaar mata kunti dwaara bhagwaan shiv kii puja karne ke liye pandavon ne is mandir ke nirmaan kaa ek raatri main hi puraa karne kaa sankalp liya jo puraa nahin ho sakaa
 Thus, this temple is incomplete till date
 is mat ke anusaar aisi manyata he ki mandir kaa nirmaan kala, sthapaty or vidya ke mahaan sangrakshak madhya-bharat ke parmaar vansheey raja bhojdev ne 11veen shatabdi main karavaaya
 According to the traditions and beliefs, it was he who built Bhojpur and now a dam that was broken
 mandir kaa nirmaan kabhi purna nahin ho paaya, atah yahan ek shilanyas yaa udghaatan / nirmaan ankan shila kii kami he
 Nevertheless the name here is Bhojpur which is associated with the name of Raja Bhoj
 kuch manyataon ke anusaar yah mandir ek hi raat main nirmit hona tha kintu isaki chat kaa kaam puraa hone ke pehle hi subah ho gai, isliye kaam adhuraa rah gaya
 The recognition of the construction by Raja Bhoj is also supported by the artifacts of the site, whose carbon age-calculation ensured them of the 11th century itself
 bhojpur ke ek nikatavarti jain mandir main, jis par unheen shilpiyon ke pahchaan chihn hai, jinke is shiv mandir par bane hai; un par 1035 i kii hi nirmaan tithi ankit he
 Apart from many literary works, historical evidence here also confirms the rule of King Bhoja in the year 1035 AD
 raja bhoj dwaara jari kiye gaye modas tamra patr, unke raajakavi dashabal rachit chintamani saranika aadi is pushti ke sahaayak hai
 There used to be three dams and one lake in the adjacent area of this temple
 itane bade sarovar evam teen bade baadhon kaa nirmaan koi shaktishaalee raja hi karvaa saktaa tha
 All these evidences appear in favor of the temple being built by King Bhoja
 puraatatvashastri prokirit manakodi is mandir ke nirmaan kaal ko raja bhoj ke shashan ke uttarardh main, lagbhag 11veen shatabdi ke madhya kaa bataate hai
 Inscriptions written by later Parmar rulers in the Udaipur Commendation contain such references as: phrases like those filled with temples, and dedicated facts related to Shiva
 inamen kedareshwar, rameshwar, somnath, kalbhairav evam rudra kaa varnan bhi miltaa he
 According to the proverbs and traditions, he also built a Saraswati temple
 ek jain lekhak merutung ne apni kriti prabandh chintamani main likhaa he ki raja bhoj ne akele apni rajdhani dhar main hi 104 mandiron kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 However, as on date, only Bhojpur temple is the only remaining monument, which can be associated with the name of Raja Bhoj
 prabandh chintamani ke anusaar; jab raja bhoj ek baar shrimaal gayi to unhone kavi magh ko bhojaswamin naamak mandir ke bare main bataaya tha jiskaa ve nirmaan karwaane vaale the
 After this, the king returned to Malwa
 haalanki magh kavi raja bhoj ke samakaleen nahin the, atah yah katha kalbhramit prathit hoti he
 This temple was originally built on the banks of an 18
5 mile long and 7
5 mile wide lake
 is sarovar kii nirmaan yojana main raja bhoj ne pathar evam baaluu ke teen baandh banawaaye
 The first of these was built on the Betwa River, which used to hold water and there were hills in that valley from the remaining three sides
 doosraa baandh vartmaan mendua gram ke nikat do pahadiyon ke bich ke sthaan ko jodakar jal kaa nikaas roak kar rakhata tha evam teesraa baandh aaj ke bhopal shahar ke sthaan par bana tha jo ek choti mausami nadi kaaliyasot ke jal ko mode kar is betwa sarovar ko de detaa tha
 These artificial reservoirs remained until the 15th century
 ek gond kinvadanti ke anusaar malwa naresh hoshang shah ne apni sena se is band ko tudwa daalaa jisamen unhen teen maheene kaa samay lag gaya tha
 It is also told that Hoshang Shah's boy was drowned in the dam's lake and even after searching a lot, his body was not found
 naaraaz hokar usne band ko top se uda diya or mandir ko bhi top se hi gira dene kii koshish kii thi
 Due to this, the top and side part of the temple fell
 is baandh ke tut jane se sara pani bah gaya or tab is apaar jalarashi ke ekaek samaapt ho jane ke kaaran malwa kshetra main jalwaayu parivartan aa gaya tha
 Two annual fairs are also organized at this famous site on the time of Makar Sankranti and Maha Shivaratri respectively
 is samay is dharmik aayojan main bhaag lene ke liye dur dur se log yahan pahonchte hai
 The lake here extends to present day Bhopal
 mandir nirmaan main prayog kiya gaya pathar bhojpur ke hi patharile kshetron se praapt kiya gaya tha
 The remains of cutting stones and rocks are seen from near to the temple
 lekhika vidya dehejia kii pustak arli stone temples of odisha main ullekh miltaa he ki bhojpur ke shiv mandir or bhubaneshwar ke lingraj mandir va kuch or mandiron ke nirmaan main samanta dikhaai padati he
 There are many unique components in Bhojpur temple, some of which are as follows: Deletion of the pavilion from the sanctum sanctorum, straight line roof instead of the domed peak in the temple
 mandir kii bahari deevaaron main se teen bahari ore se ekadam sapaat hai, kintu ye 12veen shatabdi kii bataayi jaati hai
 After studying these unique components, a researcher Krishna Deva is of the opinion that the temple may have been related to the functions related to the funeral, etc; As can often be seen even near cremation grounds etc
 is shodh kii pushti kaalaantar main madhusudan dhaki dwaara khoje gayi kuch madhyakaalin vaastusambandhi paathya se bhi hoti he
 It is known from these fragmentary texts that after the death of many high-ranking persons, a memorial-like temple was built on their remains or funeral sites
 is prakaar ke mandiron ko swargarohan-prasaad kaha jaataa tha
 According to the text, in this type of temples, receding stone blocks are used instead of a single peak
 kirit manakodi ke anusaar bhojpur mandir kii adhirachana is praaroop par sateek baithti he
 According to his estimate, Raja Bhoj may have built this temple for his late father Sindhuraj or Tau Vakapati Munj, who died in a humiliating place in the enemy area
 yahaan dekhakar aisa prathit hota he ki nirmaan kaary ekadam se hi roak diya gaya hoga
 Though the reasons for this are still unknown, but the history of the people speculate that this may have happened due to a natural disaster, lack of supply of resources or the start of a war
 2006-07 main iske punuruddhar kaary ke armbh hone se purv imaarat kii chat bhi nahin thi
 With this, the historian KK Muhammed speculated that the roof may have collapsed during the construction period itself due to mathematical architectural defects in the correct estimation of the entire load
 tab raja bhoj ne is dosha ke kaaran ise punarnirmaan na kar mandir ke nirmaan ko hi roak diya hoga
 Historians, archaeologists and architects also get a lot of knowledge of the organizing and mechanics of the 11th century temple construction style from the evidences found from the then abandoned site
 mandir ke uttari evam purvi ore kai khadaan sthal bhi mili hai, jahaan vibhinn staron ke adhure shilp evam shilpakritiyaan bhi mili hai
 Apart from this, a huge slope has been found to carry heavy stone parts from the quarry to the top of the temple
 bahut si shilpakritiyaan khadaan se mandir ke nikat laakar aise hi rakhi hui mili hai
 They will have to be used later at the time of temple construction, but they would have been left as such after the construction stopped
 puratetvik surveykshan vibhaag ne inhen 20veen shatabdi main apane bhandar grih pahunchaa diya
 The details of the architectural plan of the temple construction are carved on the stones adjacent to the quarry part
 is yojana se gyaat hota he ki yahan ek vrahat mandir parisar banane kii yojana thi, jisamen dheron anya mandir bhi banaaye jane the
 After the successful completion of this scheme, this temple complex would have been one of the largest temple complexes in India
 mandir kii imaarat, khadaanon ke nikat evam gram ke anya do mandiron par 1300 se adhik shilpakaaron ke pahchaan chihn mili hai
 These include the names of 50 craftsmen found in different parts on the main structure of the temple
apart from in naamon ke alaava anya pahchaan chihn bhi hai, jaise chakra, kate hue chakra, pahiye, trishul, swastik, shankhaakriti tathaa nagari lipi ke chihn, aadi
 These signs were made for estimating or estimating the work amount of the craftsmen or their families, which were erased at the time of finalization of the building, but the temple remained as such due to the non-completion of the construction

 aisa nirantar varsha jal risaav, uske kaaran ai sillen evam aantarik suraksha lepan ke hatane ke kaaran ho rahaa tha
 In 1951 the site was handed over to the Department of Archaeological Survey of India under the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act 1904 for conservation and restoration
 1990 ke aarmabhik dashak main, surveykshan vibhaag ne mandir ke chabutare evam garbhagrih kii sidhiyon ke marammat kaary kiye evam hathaaye hue pattharon ko punarsthapit kiya
 He also repaired the wall on the northwest side of the temple as part of the revival drive
 iske baad kuch interval tak yah kaary rukaa rahaa
 During the year 2006-07, a team of KK Muhammad's subordinate department resumed the renovation work of the memorial
 unhone sanrachana ke ek tut kar hat gayi stambh ko bhi punarsthapit kiya
 This 12 tonne monolithic pillar was to be built by the artisans and craftsmen closely matching the original copy, so for this, after the countrywide search of the stone matching the original structure, the rock was brought from near Agra and the construction of this pillar Done iske banane ke baad dal ko itani lambi bhujaa vaali kraine mashin uplabdh na ho paayi, jiske abhaav main dal ne charakhiyon evam uttolkon kii ek shrunkhlaa kii sahaayta se kaary ko purna kiya
 It took him six months to make this series
 kekemuhammad ne paaya ki mandir ke do stambhon kaa bhaar 33 ton tha, or ye donon bhi ekashm hi the, atah aadhunik praudyogiki evam sansadhano ke abhaav main tatkaaleen kaarigaron ke liye ye ek chunauti bharaa kaary rahaa hoga
 The same team also replaced the open part of the roof of the temple with a Vastu component matching a new basic structure
 ye ghatak fibar-glass se bana hone ke kaaran ek to mul sanrachana ke us bhaag se bhaar main kahin kam he atah dhaanche par anaavashyak bhaar bhi nahin daalata he, duusare varsha-jal ke risaav ko bhi prabhavi rup se rokane main sakasham he
 After this, the department has covered the space between the walls and the component of this new roof by sloping stone blocks to eliminate water leakage on the roof from other sources
 dal ne mandir kii uttari, dakshini evam pashchimi bahari deevaaron ke anshon ko bhi naye shilpakriti pashaanon ke dwaara badal diya
 The layer of dirt that has been stored on the walls of the temple for the last several centuries has also been removed beautifully

 england pravaas se lautne ke baad sheeghra hi baapu ko africa chalaa janaa padaa
 When he came to India in 1896, he took Ba along with him
 tab se ba baapu ke pad kaa anugaman karti raheen
 He had made his life as simple as that
 ve baapu ke dharmik evam deshseva ke mahavraton main sadaiv unke saath raheen
 This is the essence of all his life
 baapu ke anek upwaason main ba praaia: unke saath raheen or unki saar sanbhaal karti raheen
 When Bapu started fasting in Yerwada jail in 1932 on the question of Harijans, Ba was in Sabarmati jail
 us samay ve bahut baichaiyn ho uthin or unhen tabhi chaiyn mila jab ve yarvada jail bheji garin
 The rites of religion were deeply ingrained in Ba
 ve kisi bhi avasthaa main maance or sharaab lekar manus deh bhrasht karne ko taiyaar na thim
 He refused to drink meat broth even in a state of difficult disease in Africa and persevered for a lifetime
 dakshin africa main 1913 main ek aisa kanoon paas hua jiske anusaar isai mat ke anusaar kiye gaye or vivaah vibhaag ke adhikari ke yahan darj kiye gaye vivaah ke atirikt anya vivaahon kii manyata agrahya kii gai thi
 In other words, marriages of Hindus, Muslims, Parsis etc
 were declared illegal and the status of such married women became more like a mistress than a wife
 baapu ne is kanoon ko rad karaane kaa bahut prayaas kiya
 But when they did not succeed, then they decided to do Satyagraha and called upon women to join it
 par is baat kii charchaa unhone anya striyon se to kii kintu ba se nahin kii
 He did not want Ba to go to the satyagrahis at his behest and then present a difficult situation after falling into difficulties
 ve chaahate the ki ve swechhaya jaayan or jaayan to drudh rahen
 When Ba saw that Bapu did not talk to him about taking part in the Satyagraha, he became very sad and gave a blessing to Bapu
 phir swechhaya satyagrah main sammilit hui or teen anya mahilaon ke saath jail garin
 The food he got in the jail was inedible, so he decided to make fruit
 kintu jab unke is anurodh par koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya to unhone upwas karnaa aarambh kar diya
 On the fifth day, officers had to bow down
 kintu jo fal die gaye vah puure bhojan ke liye paryaapt na the
 So Ba had to stay in jail for three months on half stomach food
 jab ve jail se chhutin to unka sharir thathri maatr rah gaya tha
 Except for going to jail in South Africa, he probably did not participate in any public work there, but after coming to India, Bapu shared all the tasks he took, like an experienced soldier
 champaran ke satyagrah ke samay ba bhi tiharva gram main rahakar gaanvon main gumti or dawa vitaran karti raheen
 In this work, the white people got a sense of politics
 unhone ba kii anupasthiti main unki jhopadi jalawaa di
 Children used to study in that hut of Ba
 apni yah chatshaala ek din ke liye bhi band karnaa unhen pasand na tha at: unhone sari raat jagakar ghaas kaa ek doosraa jhopra khadaa kiya
 Similarly, at the time of Kheda Satyagraha, women wandered around and encouraged them
 1922 main jab baapu giraftaar kiye gaye or unhen chah saal kii sajaa hui us samay unhone jo vaktavy diya vah unhen virangana ke rup main pratishthit karata he
 He called upon the people to abandon foreign clothes to protest against Gandhiji's arrest
 baapu kaa sandesh sunaane naujavaanon kii tarah gujarat ke gaanvon main gumti phirin
 In the days of Dandi Cooch and Dharasana's raid in 1930, Bapu continued to fill Bapu's absence in a way
 ve police ke atyaacharon se peedit janata kii sahaayta karti, dhairya bandhaati phirin
 He spent most of 1932 and 1933 in jail
 1939 main rajkot ke thakur sahab ne praja ko katipay adhikaar dena sweekaar kiya tha kintu baad main mukar gaye
 The public decided to do Satyagraha to express their protest against it
 ba ne jab yah suna to unhen laga ki rajkot unka apana ghar he
 It is their duty to participate in the Satyagraha to be held there
 unhone iske liye baapu kii anumati praapt kii or ve rajkot pahonchte hi savinay avagya ke abhiyog main najarband kar lee garin
 First he was kept in a secluded village in Sunsan where the atmosphere was not favorable to him at all
 janata ne andolan kiya ki unka swasthya thik nahin he, unhen chikitsa kii suvidha se dur rakhana ammanushik he
 As a result, she was kept in a palace, 10–15 miles from Rajkot
 ba ke jane ke kuch samay baad baapu ne bhi satyagrah main bhaag lene kaa nishchay kiya or vahaan pahunchakar upwas aarambh kiya
 When Ba got the news of this, he decided to have a meal at one time
 baapu ke upwas ke samay ve sadaiv hi aisa karti thim
 Two or three days later, the Rajkot government, forgetting that they could go to meet Bapu, sent them to Bapu
 kintu jab shaam ko koi unhen najarbandi ke sthaan par waapas le jane nahin aayaa tab pataa chalaa ki is chalaave se unhen reeha kiya gaya he
 Bapu did not tolerate this
 unhone ba ko ek baje raat ko jail waapas bheja
 The Rajkot government did not dare to let them stay on the road all night
 ve waapas rajmahal le jaai gayin or uske baad duusare din ve baqayada reeha kii gayin
 After Bapu Adi was arrested on 9 August 1942, Ba decided to give a speech in the meeting at Shivaji Park, where Bapu himself was going to give a speech, but was arrested when he reached the gate of the park
 do din baad ve puna ke aagaa khan mahal main bhej di garin
 Bapu was already arrested and sent there
 us samay ve aswasth thim
 On 15 August, when Mahadev Desai suddenly did Mahaprayana, why did he keep saying Mahadev again and again; Why not me? Later, the shrine of Mahadev Desai became like a temple to shankar-mahadev for him

 She also lit a lamp on him
 giraftaar kii raat ko unka jo swasthya bigadaa vah phir santoshjanak rup se sudhara nahin or antatogatva unhone 22 farvari 1944 ko apana aihik samaapt kiya
