 The latter symptoms may be related to abdominal aneurysm and bile duct
 adhiktar arbud adenocarcinoma hote hai or kuch fisadi squamus koshika ke karkat hote hai

 Due to Dr
 Pitambaradatta Barathwal's indescribability of spiritual experience, the seeker sometimes has to adopt a way of expressing himself by conflicting utterances, such as moonless moonlight, sunless sunlight, etc
 and on the basis of this, such esoteric symbols are created
 "reversal" or "reversal"
 jab satya kii abhivyakti bina in paraspar virdohi kathanon ke sahare nahin ho paati to use aavashyak satyabhaas kah sakate hai
 But sometimes these reversals are also used to deliberately hide the meaning so that the secrets of the spiritual path are not revealed to unqualified persons
 aisi ulatvasiyon ko jaan boojhkar rachi gai ulatvasiyaan kar sakate hai
 Generally, spiritual practices are explained in such reversals

 There is no doubt that there is a high degree of poetry in symbolic reversals

 The order according to the world is: dharma-artha-kama-moksha, earth-water-fast-air-sky-brahma-vishnu-shiva etc
; That is, all the opposite, because the one who is best should be put first and the one who is relatively less is better later

 windos vista microsoft ke oparating system kii shrinkhalaa kii sabase nai kadi he or sambhawatah windos 95 ke pashchaat sabase krantikari bhi
 Although the Vista operating system has gained more popularity due to its three-dimensional graphics format and various desktop animations, it is in fact considered to be the most secure operating system ever released by Microsoft
 sanchaar or netwarking ke lihaaj se bhi yah apane se pichley aaparating system kii tulana main zyada kshamtawan he
 Hindi support for Vista is also fully available and through the Hindi Language Interface Pack, Windows Vista can be fully painted in Hindi
 computer upyogkartaaon ke man main jigyaasa he ki kya sachmuch unhen microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya nayaa oparating system windos vista apnaane kii jarurat he
 Does Microsoft's previous operating systems Windows XP Windows 2003 and Windows 2000 have such features that it is not possible to ignore
 microsoft kaa daawa he ki vista pichley windos kii tulana main adhik sakasham, saral, tej, sudarshan or surakshit he
 Vista opens and closes faster than previous operating systems
 start ap or shat down prakriyaayein paanch se das second main puri ho jaati hai
 Although Vista's relatively better hardware also contributes to this, special efforts have been made in the code of the operating system itself
 vista kii teji kaa kaaran uski memri ke prabandhan kii nai takanic bhi he jo adhik istemaal kiye jane vaale anuprayogon ko pehle se hi loding ke liye taiyaar rakhti he
 This is called 'memory fetch'
 vista main die gaye ready boost feechar ne bhi isaki gati badhaane main yogadan diya he
 Until now, pagefiles were used as virtual memory to meet additional memory requirements in Windows
 inhen computer kii hard discs par rakhaa jaataa tha
 But Vista has a provision of using a USB drive that works at a much faster speed than a hard disk
 microsoft ne apane nae aaparating system main hybrid hard drive saport bhi pradaan kiya he jiske tahat flash drive or paaramparik hard drive donon ko sanyukt rup se istemaal kar computer kii gati badha jaati he
 One of the first things to get noticed in Windows Vista is its beautiful vocal and graphic effects called Windows Aero
 haalaanki maikintosh computer par is tarah ke sudarshan graphics pehle se hi maujuud hai lekin windos plateform par ye pehali baar 'vista' ke madhyam se hi saamne aae hai
 On computers with Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate and Enterprise editions that have a good graphics adapter, Aero's stunning graphics effects can be enjoyed
 is mukhaawaran ne windos kaa kalevar hi badal diya he or use pehle kii tulana main behad aakarshak, vividhtapurna or shaleen bana diya he
 Aero's high quality graphics and visual effects enhance the beauty of a Windows computer but it does not impair the functionality or speed of the computer

 Microsoft has paid special attention to this in Vista
 haalaanki vista kii mul 'karnel' to nae sire se nahin likhi he lekin uski suraksha ko is baar bahut majboot bana diya gaya he
 First of all, now not all parts of this operating system run in kernel mode, but only a select few of them run
 vista main zyaadaatar driver or software yujar mod main chalate hai or karnel mod main kisi bhi na cheez ko install karnaa aasaan nahin rah gaya he
 This requires security certificate and administrator level rights
 or administrator str ke visheshadhikaar praapt karnaa, visheshkar daftaron main, ab bahut mushkil hoga
 Windows Vista has limited common user rights
 aisa bhi nahin he ki aap bataur saamaanya upyogkarta ke apane computer main ko software instaal hi na kar paaen
 To do this, they get the necessary rights temporarily
 microsoft ne vista aaparating system install karne ke lihaaj se computaron kii do shreniyan banaai hai- vista capable pisi or vista premium ready 
 All such computers are Windows Vista enabled with at least 800 mhz processor and 512 MB system memory available
 is tarah ke procesar to ab durlabh se ho gaye hai kyonki bazaar main 2 gigahatrj se kam ke procesar shaayad hi koi kharid rahaa ho
 If you have bought your computer in the last two years, then its processor will have at least this much capacity
 rahi system memri kii baat to ho saktaa he ki aapke paaramparik computer main 128 embi yaa 256 embi memri lagi ho
 In such a situation, you may have to upgrade your RAM by spending seven to eight hundred rupees
 windos vista sakasham computer ke liye kam se kam diarect eks 9 ko samarthan dene vaala graphics card hona chahie jisamen dabludidm driver samarthan uplabdh ho
 a graphics memory of 32 MB in a computer's graphics card is sufficient
 iske atirikt aapako ek dividi rome drive kii aavashyaktaa padegi jo sambhavat: aapke computer main pehle se hi maujuud ho

 An autotransformer is a transformer with a structure that has only one winding
 ek hi vinding kaa kuch bhaag primary kaa kaam karata he or kuch bhaag dwitiyak vinding kaa kaam karata he
 Thus, this single winding has at least three electrical ends
 is tarah kaa transafarmar samaan kevie reating se saamaanya transafarmar kii apeksha aakaar or vajan main chota hota he
 But there is no isolation between primary and secondary, which is essentially necessary somewhere
 autotransformar main ek hi vinding hoti he jiske do siron ke alaava bich main bhi ek yaa adhik truminal hote hai
 The primary is placed between the two ends
 output voltage bich ke kisi terminal or ek antim sire ke bich liya jaataa he
 Each turn of the entire winding of this transformer has the same voltage, whether it is in the turn primary or in the secondary
 autotransformar main primary se kuch dhara sidhe lod ko chali jaati he
 v 1 v 2 = n 1 n 2 = a { \ displaystyle { \ frac {V_ {1}} {V_ {2}}} = { \ frac {N_ {1}} {N_ {2}}} = a} The ampere-turns provided by the upper half: FU = i 1 = n 1 i 1 { \ displaystyle F_ {U} = I_ {1} = N_ {1} I_ {1}} The ampere-turns provided by the lower half: FL = n 2 = n 1 a { \ displaystyle F_ {L} = N_ {2} = { \ frac {N_ {1}} {a}}} For ampere-turn balance, FU=FL: n 1 i 1 = n 1 a { \ displaystyle N_ {1} I_ {1} = { \ frac {N_ {1}} {a}}} Therefore: i 1 i 2 = 1 a { \ displaystyle { \ frac {I_ {1}} {I_ {2}}} = { \ frac {1} {a}}} autotransformar kaa aakaar samaan aakaar ke do vinding vaale transformar se chota hota he
 They are also autotransformers but the output is not taken from a fixed point but through a carbon brush sliding on the winding 
 isse laabh yah hota he ki output main ek seemaa ke andar koi bhi voltata praapt kii ja sakati he
 For this reason, it is used in testing many devices
 udhaaharan ke liye iskaa upyog balb ko aavashyaktaanusaar kam yaa adhik tivrata se jalaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, it can be used to 'soften' the motor
 iskaa iske brush ko swatah niyantrit karke isse ek voltage-stablizer bhi banaaya jaataa he

 ‘two aspects of a printing’


 are ‘originality in its effectiveness’



 kyonki "supaathya" kaa aam arth "pathneey" hi he phir bhi kuch log hai, jinamein se kuch vyavsaayik rup se typography se jude log bhi hai, jo yah sochate hai ki "supaathyata " ek aisa shabd he jisapar tip kii prabhaavashiltaa ko lekar or bahes kii jarurat he
 But clarity and readability vary, although they are related to the type aspect
 sahi tareeke se janaa hua he ki ye do shabd tip kii visheshta or kaary ke vishleshan ko akele supaathyata shabd kii tulana main bahut hi sankshipt bhang se samajhane main madad kar sakate hai
 


 in typography we need to give a definition of legibility 


 to understand the meaning of clarity and the quality of being easily identifiable - so, for example, we can say that the lower size of the old italic style is lower
 Case h is not obvious because its folded leg looks like b; Or a number 3 is very similar to an 8 in a classified ad
 


 disple aakaaron main suvachyata ke maamle gambhir hote hai, ek varna jo 8 point par anischitata kaa kaaran hota he vahi 24 point par spasht ho jayega
 It is worth noting that the above principle applies to people with 20 / 20 vision at the appropriate reading distance in the required light
 arth kii swatantraaa or drishy kii tikshnata kii pariksha ke liye ek opticiuns chart kii samanta, spashtataa kii avadharana kii gunjaaish kaa sanket karne ke liye upyogi he
 'in typography 


 if the columns of a newspaper or magazine or the pages of a book can be read for many minutes without stress or difficulty, then we can say that the readability of the type is good
 is baat se drishy aaraam kii gunvattta kaa sanket miltaa he - paath kii lambii vistrut samaj main yah ek mahatvapurn aavashyaktaa he, lekin iske vipareet, telephone nirdeshika yaa hawaii jahaaj kii samay sarini jaisi chizon ke liye yah utana mahatvapurn nahin he, jahaan pathak ise lagaataar padhate nahin hai balki ek choti cheez kii soochna ko dhundte hai
 The difference in both aspects of visual effects is made by a familiar argument of sans-serif's suitability for text setting
 ek vishisht sans-cerife phase ke varna aapas main purna rup se samaj main aa sakate hai, lekin ek prasiddh upanyaas ko koi bhi isamen set karne ke bare main nahin soch saktaa kyonki isaki pathneeyata kam he
 Readability 'relates to direct knowledge' and readability 'refers to understanding'
 Typographers aim to excel in both
 "chunaa hua tiphphes spasht hona chahie
 matlab, yah prayaas ke bina padhaa janaa chahie
 kabhi kabhi spashtataa mahaj tip ke aakaar kaa maamla he
 But very often, this is a case of typeface design
 saamanyat: jo tiperphes buniyadi letterfarm ke najadik hote hai, ve un tiperpheson ke mukaable adhik spasht hote hai jo saghan, faile hue, sanware hue yaa alag hote hai
 However, a clear typeface can also be unreadable due to weak settings and sequence space, just as clear typefaces can be made more readable by good design
 spashtataa or pathneeyata donon ke adhyayan ne tip ke aakaar or dizin sahit anya tatwon ke ek bade range kii jaanch kii he
 For example, comparing serif vs sans serif type, italic type vs roman type, line length, line spacing, color contrast, right-edge design versus right extension, and whether the text is hyphenated
 suvachyata anusandhan unnisvin sadi ke baad ke dinon main prakashit kii gai
 Although there are often commonalities and consensus on many topics, others often bring up poignant areas of conflict and diversity of opinion
 udhaaharan ke liye, elex pool ke anusaar kisi ne bhi iskaa antim uttar nahin diya he ki koun phant, ceriphd yaa sans cerriff sabase adhik spashtataa pradaan karata he
 Other topics such as justified vs unzestified, use of hyphen, fonts suitable for people with difficulty reading, such as dyslexia, continue to be debated

 Clarity is usually measured through reading speed and with a level of comprehension to check effectiveness
 udhaaharan ke liye, miles tinkar, jisane, 1930 se 1960 ke dashak main kai adhyayanon ko prakashit karaayaa, tej gati se padhane ke pareekshan kaa upyog kiya jisamen aise pratibhaagiyon kii jarurat thi jo prabhaavashiltaa ke filter ke rup main betuke shabdon kaa upyog na karen
 The printability of the Royal College of Art's readability under the supervision of Professor Herbert Spencer, along with Brian Coe and Linda Reynolds, did important work in this area and was one of many centers that highlighted the importance of eye saccadic rhythms for readability - one Ability to take three words in a bar and physiognomy of the eye which means eye fatigue, if more than 3 or 4 second jump is required in the line
 Is
 isse adhik padhane main tanaav or trutiyaan pai jaati hai 
 These days, clarity-related research has been confined to difficult issues, or limited to testing specific design solutions
 Examples of difficult issues may include typefaces for people with visual impairments and typefaces for highway signs or other situations where clarity can make a significant difference
 suvachyata anusandhan sahitya kaa bahut kuch etheoratical he - vibhinn karkon kaa vyaktigat yaa samooh main pareekshan kiya gaya, lekin kai pareekshan padhane ke model yaa drishy dharna ke abhaav main kiye gaye
 Some typographers believe that overall word size) is very important for readability and that the theory of parallel letterwise identification is either inaccurate, less important, or does not include everything
 is baat ke sandarbh main ki log padhate samay aksharon kii pahchaan kaise karte hai, boma pahchaan evam saamanaantar akshar ke anuroop pahchaan main antar karne vaale adhyayanon ne saamanantar akshar ke anuroop pahchaan kaa samarthan kiya he jise sangyanatmak manovaigyanikon ne vyapak taur par sweekaar kiya he
 Some commonly agreed conclusions about feasibility research include the following: pathneeyata main letters-spacing, verde-spacing yaa bahut kase hue yaa ek dam deele liding ke dwaara bhi jokhim paidaa hota he

 Urdhvapundra Chandan: ★ The artistic style of Vaishnav sects is called Tilak Upadhyapundra
 chandan, gopichndan, harichandan yaa roli se bhrikuti ke madhya main nasagra yaa nasamul se lalaat par kesh paryant ankit khadi do rekhaaen urdhvapundr kahi jaati hai
 | ★ There are two types of beliefs in the Puranas about Vaishnava vertigo
 naarad puraana main – ise vishnu kii gada kaa dyotak mana gaya he
 urdhvapundropanishad main – urdhvapundr ko vishnu ke charan paad kaa pratik bataakar vistaar se isaki vyakhya kii he
 | ★ In the Puranas - the south line of the vertical line has been considered as the reflection of the "dakshin Charan Tal" of Vishnu avatar Rama or Krishna, which has Vajra, Ankush, Ambar, Kamal, Yava, Octagon, Flag, Chakra, Swastika and Vertical
 ★ And the line towards the left hairline of the vertical is Vishnu's "left foot plane" which consists of Gopad, Conch, Jambuffal, Kalash, Sudha Kund, Ardha Chandra, Shatakon, Pisces, Bindu, Triangle and Indus signs
 ★ in mangalakaari chinhon ke dhaaran karne se vajra se – bal tathaa paap sanhaar, ankush se – mananigrah, ambar se – bhay va Acharya Dev of the definition defined by the litterateurs has given this symptom of the wonderful rasa - 'ahcharj Dekhe Sune Bismai Burhadat chitt adbhut ras bismay badhai achal sachkit nimitt’
 Bharatmuni has told the origin of the wonderful with the heroic juice and its character is called yellow and the deity Brahma
 vishwanath ke anusaar iske devtaa gandharv hai
 The definition of 'amazement' is given in 'saraswati Kantabharana' - 'vismayantantavistara: Padarthatishyadibhi:' The expansion of the mind arising from the transgression of any supernatural substance is amazement
 vishwanath ne ‘sahityadarpan’ main is paribhaasha ko duhraate hue vismay ko chamatkaar kaa paryaay bataaya he - ‘chamatkaarashchittavistaar rupo vismayapraparyaay:’ 
 Therefore, that miraculous state of mind, in which it rises outside the periphery of the ordinary and gains expansion, will be called 'astonishment'
 vastav main yah vismay yaa chamatkaar prayek gahari anubhuti kaa aavashyak ang he or isiilie yah prayek ras kii pratiti main vartmaan rahata he
 Bhanudatta has said that astonishment communicates in all the juices
 vishwanath rasaswad ke prakaar ko samajhaate hue kehete hai ki ras kaa praan ‘lokottar chamatkaar’ he or is prakaar sarvatra, sampoorn rasgarbhit sthanon main adbhut ras mana janaa chahie
 In this connection, he has quoted the following lines - 'rasse saraschamakatara: Sarvatrapayanubhuyate
 tachchamatkarsaratwe sarvatrapyadbhuto ras:
 Tasmadadbhutmeva Kriti Narayano Rasam
 ’ arthath sab rason main chamatkaar sarrup se hone se sarvatra adbhut ras hi prathit hota he
 Therefore, Narayan Pandit considers only a wonderful rasa
 manovaigyanikon ke anusaar manovigyaniyon ne bhi vismay ko pradhan bhaavon main gruhit kiya he tathaa uski pravriti ‘jigyaasa’ se bataai he
 In fact, the primitive human being must have believed these two emotions mainly in the context of nature's playground
 kala evam kavy ke aakarshan main vismay kii bhaavana sarvaadhik mahatva rakhti he
 The object which the poet and artist want to depict the beauty, there exists an element that encroaches the folk, which overwhelms the spirit with its extravagance
 angrezi sahitya ke romantic kaviyon ne kavy kii aatma vismay ko hi sweekaar kiya tha
 Therefore, the importance of the wonderful juice is proven itself
 sahitya shastriyon ne ras ke virodh evam avirodh kaa vyaakhyaan kiya he

 Hey mother You are always seated on the best Vindhyachal in the mountains
 padmapurana main vindhyachal-nivasini in mahashakti ko vindhyavasini ke naam se sambandhit kiya gaya he- vindhyevindhyaadhivasini
 The story comes in the tenth Skanda of Srimaddevi Bhagwat, the creator Brahmajee when first born Swayambhuvamanu and Shatrupa from his mind
 tab vivaah karne ke uparant swymbhuv manu ne apane haathon se devi kii murti banaakar sau varsho tak kathor tap kiya
 Satisfied with his austerity, Bhagwati blessed him with a fair state, family growth and the ultimate post
 var dene ke baad mahadevi vindhyachalparvat par chali gai
 From this it is clear that Vindhyavasini has been worshiped since the beginning of creation
 sristi kaa vistaar unke hi shubhashishase hua
 In the Treta Yug, Lord Shri Ram Chandra came to Vindhyachal with Sitaji
 maryaada purushottam shriram dwaara sthapit rameshwar mahadev se is shaktipeeth kii mahatmaya or batch gaya he
 In Dwaparyug, when King Kansa of Mathura put his sister-in-law devaki-vasudev in prison and he killed their children
 tab vasudevajike kul-purohit garg rishi ne kansa ke vadh evam shrikrishnavatar hetu vindhyachal main lakshachandi kaa anushthan karke devi ko prasann kiya
 As a result of which she appeared at Nandaraji's place
 markendeyapurana ke antargat varnit durgasaptshati ke gyarahawein adhyay main devataaon ke anurodh par bhagwati unhen aashwast karte hue kahati hai, devataaon vaivaswatamanvantar ke atthaiswein yug main shumbhaur nishumbhnam ke do mahadaitya utpann honge
 Then i will go to Vindhyachal, who has incarnated from his wife Yashoda's womb in Nandagop's house and will destroy both the above Asuras

 In the Sri krishna-janmakhyana of Srimad Bhagwat Maha Purana it is described that Sri Krishna, who was born from the eighth womb of Devaki, was taken to Nandaji's house in Gokul across Yamunaji, overnight by the fear of Vasudevji Kansa and there Yogoda's womb was born as the daughter of God Yogoda silently
 They brought him to Mathura
 aathvin santan ke janm kaa samachar sun kar kansa karagaar main pahunchaa
 As soon as he tried to slap the newborn girl on the stone, she got out of Kansa's hands and reached the sky and she displayed her divine form
 kansa ke vadh kii bhavishyavaanee karke bhagwati vindhyaachal waapas laut gai
 This meditation of Vindhyavasini by the name of Vandurga is mentioned in the famous scripture Sharadatilaka of Mantras
 arth-jo devi swarna-camel ke asana par virajman hai, teen netron vaali hai, vidyut ke sadrush kaanti vaali hai, chaar bhujaaon main shankh, chakra, var or abhaya mudra dhaaran kiye hue hai, mastak par solah kalaon se paripurna chandra sushobhit he, gale main sundar haar, baahon main baajuband, kaanon main kundal dhaaran kiye in devi kii indradi sabhi devtaa stuti karte hai
 Shiva, who resides on Vindhyachal, is always close to these Vindhyavasini with a beautiful face like the moon

 It is generally used in business or in situations where two groups speak different languages than the language of their country
 Originally, the pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, constructed immediately between people from communities
 pigin kisi baatcheet karne vaale samudaay kii deshiy bhashaa nahin he, balki dwitiya bhashaa ke rup main sikhi gai bhashaa he
 Pidgins can be formed from words, sounds or sign languages from various other languages and cultures
 aam taur par anya bhashaaon kii tulana main pigin kii pratishtha kam he
 Not all simplified or "fragmented" forms of language are pidgins
 prayek pigin ke upyog sambandhi maandand alag hai jinhen pigin main praveenta hasil karne ke liye siikhnaa zaruri he
 There is uncertainty about the origin of the word pidgin
 pehali baar pidgin shabd 1850 main mudrit hua tha or shabd kii vyutpatti ke bare main anek strot maujuud hai
 For example: shabd pidgin jise pehle pigion vartanee ke saath bhi uccharit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jo mul rup se chini pigin angrezi ko varnit karne ke liye prayukt hota tha, baad main kisi bhi pigin ko nirdisht karne ke liye lokapriy hua
 The use of pidgin may be specified as a specific name for the local pidgin or creole where it is spoken
 udhaaharan ke liye, tok pisin naam angrezi shabd talk pidgin se vyutpann he
 Speakers generally refer to it simply as "pidgin" when speaking English
 shabd jargon kaa bhi upyog pigin ko varnit karne ke liye hota he or kuch piginon ke naamon main bhi paaya gaya he, jaise ki chinuk jargan 
 is sandarbh main, aajkal bhashavid jargon kaa upyog visheshtah alpaviksit prakaar ke pigin ko nirupit karne ke liye karte hai; haalanki, yah prayog praayah durlabh he or shabd jargon aksar kisi peshey ke vishisht shabdon ko sanderbhit karata he
 Pidgin may begin or become a language of trade such as Tok Pisin
 vyapaarik bhashaaen apane aap main aksar swahili, farsi yaa angrezi jaisi viksit bhashaaen ho sakati he
 Business languages are oriented towards "ie languages", while Pidgin develops as a native language
 chunki pigin bhashaa moulik rup se sanchaar kaa saral rup he, aam taur par jahaan tak sambhav ho uskaa vyakaran or swar-vigyaan saral hota he or saamanytah isamen shaamil hote hai: The construction of pidgin generally requires: iske alaava, kith whinom suzav dete hai ki pigin ke nirmaan ke liye teen bhashaaon kii zarurat he, jisamen ek spasht rup se anya se prabhavi ho
 It is often believed that when a generation of pidgin-speaking parents teaches their children it as their first language, pidgin becomes the creole language
 uske baad creole samudaay kii deshi bhashaa banane ke liye vartmaan bhashaaon ke mishran kii jagah le leti he 
 tathaapi, sabhi pigin creole bhashaaen nahin banati hai; is charan se pehle hi pigin samaapt ho sakati he 
 Other scholars, such as Salikoko Mfwane, argue that pidgin and creole arise independently under different circumstances and do not necessarily always have pidgin before creole, nor does creole develop from pidgin
 magavene ke anusaar, pigin vyapaar coloniyon ke "dainandin parsparik kriya ke liye apni deshi boli ko sangrakshit karne vaale prayoktaaon" ke bich ubhari
 is bich, creole upnivesh coloniyon main viksit hui jahaan europea bhashaa bolne vaale, aksar maanak se kam bhashaai str vaale anubandhit karmchaaree, gair-europea daason ke saath vyapak rup se paraspar baatcheet karte the, jisamen ghulaamon ke gair-europea deshi bhashaaon ke kuch shabd or visheshtaayen aatmsaat ho jate the, jiske parinamswaroop mul bhashaa kaa baari kramik-parivartit sanskaran saamne aa jaataa he
 These men and slaves, not only when in need of contact with a high-level language speaker, but also use Creole as their day-to-day local dialect

 Hemoglobin is also found outside the red blood cells and progenitor lines that produce them
 Other hemoglobin-containing cells include the A9 dopaminergic neuron, macrophage, alveolar cells, and mesangial cells of the kidneys of the substancia nigra
 The role of hemoglobin in these tissues is as an antioxidant and a regulator of iron metabolism, rather than oxygen transport

 Reversible oxidation of hemoglobin was reported by Felix haap-sealer after a few more years
 In 1959 Max Perutz determined the molecular structure of hemoglobin by X-ray crystallography
 For this achievement, he was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with John Kendrew

 stanpayiyon ke sabase aam haemoglobin main aisi chaar upikaiyaan hoti hai
 Hemoglobin consists mostly of proteins and these proteins are made up of chains of amino acids
 These chains are linear in form, such as a written sentence containing letters or beads in a garland
 The variation in the types of amino acids in the protein chain of amines acids in all proteins determines the chemical properties and function of that protein
 The same applies to hemoglobin, in which a series of amino acids can affect important functions such as the attraction of proteins to oxygen

 In any one species, different types of hemoglobin are always present, although one chain is usually the most common in every species
 Differentiation of hemoglobin produces different types of hemoglobin protein genes
 There is no disease due to many of these deformed types
 But some malformed hemoglobins cause a group of genetic diseases called hemoglobinopathies
 Sickle cell disease is the most famous hemoglobinopathy, which is the first human disease, the process of which is understood at the molecular level
 In another group of diseases, thalassemia, small amounts of normal or sometimes abnormal hemoglobins are produced due to problems and pathologies of the globin gene control
 There is anemia in all these diseases

 Synthesis of hemoglobin occurs in a complex step chain
 Synthesis of the heme portion occurs in various steps in the mitochondria and cytosol of immature red blood cells, while the globin protein portions are synthesized by ribosomes in the cytosol
 Hemoglobin in the bone marrow is produced in the cell throughout the period of its early development from the proerythroblast to the reticulocyte stage
 At this time the nucleus of mammals' red blood cells disappears, but this does not happen in birds and many other species
 Despite the absence of a nucleus in mammals, the remaining ribosomal RNA produces hemoglobin until the reticulocyte's RNA is depleted after entering the bloodstream

 In most humans, the hemoglobin molecule is a group of four globular protein subunits
 Each subunit is made up of a protein chain tightly connected to a non-protein heme group
 Each protein chain is arranged in a globin fold arrangement as a set of interconnected alpha-helix conformational segments, as other heme / globin proteins such as myoglobin have the same folding motif-like arrangement
 There is a space in this folding pattern, which holds the heme group firmly

 The most common hemoglobin type in adult humans is a tetramer called hemoglobin A, which consists of two alpha and two beta subunits with non-covalent bonds composed of 141 and 146 amino acids, respectively
 This is indicated by α2β2
 These subunits are anatomically similar and approximately the same size
 The molecular weight of each subunit is about 17000 daltons and the total molar mass of the tetramer is about 68000 daltons
 In this way 1 g / dl = 0
1551 millimole / l
 Hemoglobin a is the most refined molecule among hemoglobin molecules
 maanav shishuon main haemoglobin anu 2 alpha or 2 gamma shrinkhalaaon se bana hota he

 These four polypeptide chains are bound together by salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions
 There are two types of interactions between alpha and beta chains - α1β1 and α1β2

 Deoxyhemoglobin is a type of hemoglobin devoid of bound oxygen
 The absorptive spectrum of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin is different
 Oxyhemoglobin has a much lower absorption of 660 nm wavelength than deoxyhemoglobin, while its absorption is slightly higher at 940 nm
 This is why the color of hemoglobin is red and that of deoxyhemoglobin is blue
 This variation is used to measure the amount of oxygen in the patient's blood by a device called pulse oximeter
 oxykrut haemoglobin kii oxikaran sthiti nishchit karnaa kathin he kyonki prayogic maapan se oxihemoglobin diamagnetic hoti he, phir bhi oxygen or louh donon main kam-urja vaali electron sanrachanaayen paramagnetic hoti hai 
 oxygen or usase sambandhit louh kii oxikaran dashaon ke nunatam-urja prakaar nimna hai: All these structures are paramagnetic, rather than diamagnetic
 Thus, in order to understand the observed diamagnetism and unpaired electrons, an uneven distribution of electrons in the combination of iron and oxygen is necessary
 diamagnetic echbi-otu ke utpaadan ke liye teen sambhaavnaaen hai: Straightforward information is tarah, echbi-otu main louh kii sabase najdiki aupchaarik sthiti oxikaran +3 dasha hoti he, jisamen oxygen -1 dasha main hoti he
 is sanrachana main diamagnetismo superaksaide par maujuud ekal ayugal electron ke louh par sthit ekal ayugal electron se pratiferomagnetic tareeke se vyavasthit hone se utpann hota he, jisase prayog ke diamagnetic oxihemoglobin ke anusaar, sari sanrachana ko koi kul spin nahin praapt hoti
 It is not surprising to find that the second of the three possibilities above for diaminagnetic oxyhemoglobin is found to be correct by experiment - both singlet oxygen and large splits of charge are unfavorable high-energy conditions
 Moving to a higher oxidation state of iron in HB-OTO reduces the size of amu, allowing it to move to the bottom of the peripherin ring, and initiating the allosteric changes observed in glabulines by pulling the coordinated histidine residue
 jaev-acarbonic rasayanagyon dwaara prastut praarambhik siddhanton ke anusaar sambhaavna san

 aisa isaliye lagata tha kyonki louh kii metahaemoglobin ke rup main oxikaran dasha III, jab 
O2- electron ko "pakadaney" ke liye superaksaide maujuud na ho, to haemoglobin ko hawa main maujuud saamaanya triplate O2 ko baandhne main aksham bana detii he
 isaliye yah maan liya gaya ki jab oxygen gas fefdon main bandhi hoti he, to louh Fe ke rup main rahata he
 is pehle vaale clasik model main louh kaa rasayanashastra lubhaavna tha, lekin diamagnetic ucch-urja singlate oxygen kii aavashyaktaa kabhi samaj main nahin ai
 yah tark diya gaya ki oxygen anu kaa bandhan ucch spin louh ko shashakt-kshetreey ligandon ke ek octahedral kshetra main rakh detaa he –kshetra main is parivartan se sphatik kshetra main vruddhi se urja kaa vibhaajan ho jaataa he, jisase louh ke electron jode banaakar kam-spin vaali sanrachana kaa nirmaan karte hai, jo Fe main diamagnetic hote hai
 yah jabaran kam-spin yugleekaran oxygen ke bandhane par hota he, lekin yah louh ke aakaar main parivartan ko samajhane ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 louh ke chote aakaar or badi hui oxikaran dasha, va oxygen ke kamjor band ko samajhane ke liye oxygen dwaara louh se ek atirikt electron ko nikaalnaa aavashyak he
 It should be kept in mind that the determination of whole-number oxidation state is a formalism, since covalent bonds are not necessary for flawless bond sequences in full electron-transfer
 In this way, all three models of paramagnetic HB-OTO may be responsible to some extent for the actual electronic structure of HB-OTU
 But Fe of iron model in HB-OTO seems more correct than Fe
 oxygen ligand ke atirikt, jo haemoglobin ko sahakaari rup se baandhe rakhata he, haemoglobin ligandon main spardhaatmak avarohak jaise, carbon monoaksaide va alostrik ligand jaise carbon dioxide bhi shaamil hai
 When oxygen is bound to the iron complex, it causes the iron atom to move towards the center of the porphyrin ring
 At the same time, the imidazole co-chain interacting with the second pole of the histidine residue is pulled towards the porphyrin ring
 This interaction causes the ring plane to tilt outward to the outside of the tetramer and also exert pressure in the protein helix containing histidine as it approaches the iron atom
 This pressure is transmitted to the rest of the three monomers of the tetramer, which causes similar changes in other heme sites and eases the binding of oxygen to these sites
 is tarah, saamaanya vayask haemoglobin ke tetramrik prakaar main, oxygen kaa bandhikaran ek sahakaari prakriya he

 Oxygen binding is affected by molecules such as carbon monoxide
 CO heme competes with oxygen at the binding site
 The hemoglobin binding affinity of CO is 200 times greater than its oxygen affinity, meaning that small amounts of CO dramatically reduce hemoglobin's ability to carry oxygen
 When hemoglobin is combined with CO, it forms a very bright red compound called carboxyhemoglobin, which can cause the skin of a person with CO poisoning to look pink instead of white or blue after death
 When the exhaled air has levels as low as 0
02% of CO, headache and nausea occur, fainting occurs if the CO concentration is increased to 0
1%
 In heavy smokers, up to 20% of the active sites of oxygen may be blocked by CO

 ye sabhi hime main louh se uski oxikaran dasha ko badale bina bandhit hote hai, lekin oxygen bandhan ko avaruddha karte hai, jisase gambhir vishaaktata hoti he
 The iron atom of the heme group should initially be in the ferrous oxidation state for binding and transport of oxygen and other gases
 Initial oxidation in ferric condition without oxygen results in hemoglobin hemiglobin or methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen
 Normal red blood cells have a reduction mechanism to protect hemoglobin from such a condition
 Nitrogen dioxide and nitrous oxide have the potential to convert small amounts of hemoglobin to methemoglobin, but are generally not health-critical
 carbon daai oxide haemoglobin par ek bhinn bandhan sthal par sthit hoti he
 carbon daai oxide oxygenheen rakt main aasaani se ghul jaati he, jisase chayapachay karte utakon main oxygen ke pahunchane ke baad carbon daai oxide ko saralata se sharir ke baahar nikaala ja saktaa he

 anzime carbaanik enhydrage ke jariye carbon daai oxide pani se pratikriya karke carbaanik acid detii he, jo bicarbonate or protaanon main vighatit ho jaataa he - In this way, blood with high carbon dioxide has a lower ph
 Hemoglobin can bind protons and carbon dioxide, which leads to protein changes and release of oxygen
 Protons bind to the protein in many places, while carbon dioxide binds to the α-amino group
 Carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin
 The Bohr effect is a decrease in the affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen by binding of carbon dioxide and acid
 Conversely, when the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood are reduced, carbon dioxide and protons are released from hemoglobin, which increases the protein's affinity for oxygen
 bandhit kii hui oxygen ko haemoglobin dwaara mukt kiya janaa aavashyak hota he, varanaa uske bandhit hone kaa koi matlab hi nahin he

 In people adapted to high altitude climates, the concentration of 2,3-biphosphoglycerate increases in the blood, allowing these people to give higher amounts of oxygen to tissues in conditions of low oxygen stress
 This process, in which molecule y affects the binding of molecule x to transport molecule Z, is called heterotropic allosteric effect

 The hemoglobin also carries nitric oxide in the globin portion of the molecule
 This helps oxygen reach the periphery and control respiration
 NO is recurrently bound to a specific cysteine residue in globin
 This binding depends on the state of hemoglobin
 The S-nitrosylated hemoglobin obtained from it affects various no-related actions, such as duct inhibition, blood pressure, and respiration
 NO is not released into the cytoplasm of red blood cells but is transported out of them by an anion exchanger called AE1

 Different types of hemoglobin are a part of the normal development of the fetus and baby, but there may also be morbid deformable types of hemoglobin produced due to differences in genetics in a population

 Deficiency of hemoglobin may result in a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin molecules, such as in anemia, or a decrease in the ability of each molecule to bind oxygen at a partial pressure equal to oxygen
 Hemoglobinopathies can be the cause of both
 In any case, the lack of hemoglobin decreases the ability of the blood to carry oxygen
 In general, hemoglobin deficiency must be distinguished from a lack of oxygen in the blood, or a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, although both are involved in the causes of hypoxia
 Retrieved on May 25, 2009 although both are causes of hypoxia

 Symptoms of anemia are caused by a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin, with or without a deficiency of red blood cells
 There are many reasons for anemia, although iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are the main reasons for this in the western world
 Since heme synthesis is reduced due to the absence of iron, red blood cells appear light red in color and smaller in size due to iron deficiency anemia
 Other anemia is rare
 In hemolysis the hemoglobin metabolism causes jaundice due to bilirubin, and the hemoglobin in the bloodstream can cause kidney failure

 Glycosylated hemoglobin is a type of hemoglobin that is combined with glucose
 Glucose is combined with hemoglobin throughout the life of red blood cells, which is about 120 days
 Glycosylated hemoglobin levels are measured for long-term control of type 2 diabetes
 Glycosylated hemoglobin levels in red blood cells are increased if ta2dm is not properly controlled
 Generally it should be around 4-5
9%
 7% for patients with T2DM, even when it is difficult
 It is advisable to keep less than 
9%
 Levels greater than 12% signify poor control of glycosylated hemoglobin, and 12%
 Exceeding levels is considered very bad control
 Patients whose glycosylated hemoglobin level is 7%
 The chances of complications arising from diabetes are greatly reduced

 Long-term control of blood glucose levels can be done by measuring the amount of hba1c
 Samples are needed to directly measure this, as blood sugar levels can vary greatly throughout the day
 hba1c is the result of the reaction of hemoglobin a to glucose
 hba1c is high when glucose is high
 As this reaction is slow, the ratio of hba1c represents the average of glucose levels in the blood over the half-life of red blood cells
 a ratio of 6
0 percent or less of hba1c is considered to be a good long-term control of glucose, while greater than 7
0 percent
 The level of is considered insufficient control

 Many oxygen-transport and binding proteins are found in organisms throughout the animal and plant world
 Bacteria, protozoa, and mildew all contain hemoglobin-like proteins, whose known and expected roles include binding of gaseous ligands
 Since many of these proteins contain globin and heme portions, they are often called hemoglobin, even though their composition is not very different from vertebrate hemoglobin
 It is often impossible to differentiate between myoglobin and hemoglobin, especially in lower-order organisms
 , Because some of these organisms do not have muscles
 Or, they have a recognizable distinct hemorrhagic system, but are not related to the transport of oxygen
 In all these groups, the gas-binding heme and globin-containing molecules are called hemoglobins
 In addition to the transport and detection of oxygen, they are NO, CO2, sulfide compounds, And also perform O2 cleaning in anaerobic environments
 They also act as deoxidizing chlorinated materials, like heme-containing P450 enzymes and peroxidases

 One of the most common uses of hemoglobin in organisms is its use in giant tube worms, which can grow up to 2
4 meters long and live in marine volcanic vents
 These organisms contain bacteria weighing half the weight of the organism instead of the digestive tube
 These bacteria react to the vent's H2S and water's O2 to produce energy, which produces food from water and CO2
 The back end of these worms has a deep red fan-like structure, which spreads in water and absorbs CO2 for use as synthesized raw materials like H2S and O2 for bacteria and photosynthetic plants
 
 These compositions are bright-red due to the exceptionally complex hemoglobins present in them, which contain up to 144 globin chains, each containing the corresponding heme compositions

 In the brain, the A9 dopaminergic neuron of the Substantia nigra, the astrocyte of the cerebral cartex and hippocampus, and all mature oligodendrocytes are involved
 It is thought that these cells are homozygotic in brain hemoglobin oxygenated conditions
 It makes possible the storage of oxygen for the process, which A9DA does not Uranon is especially important for, as is required of them require more oxygen with high metabolism to produce energy
 In addition, A9 dopaminergic neurons are at particular risk, as they are under extremely intense oxidation pressure due to hydrogen peroxide produced by deoxygenation to dopamine made by selfoxidation and monoamine oxidase, and in which the ferrous iron reaction results in extremely toxic hydroxyl roots

 This may explain the risk of weathering of these cells in Parkinson's disease

 Historically, the color of blood was associated with war, because the ancient Romans associated Mars with the God of War because of its orange-red color
 The color of Mars is due to the presence of iron-oxygen in its soil, but the red color of the blood is not due to the iron present in the hemoglobin and its oxides, which is a misnomer
 The red color is due to the porphyrin portion of hemoglobin, which binds iron, and not iron itself, although iron ligation and redox status may affect electronic changes and thus its optical properties
