 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Steel is maintained at this temperature until the carbon trapped in the martensite diffuses and forms a chemical organization until it has the ability to form bainite or perlite
 When actually steel is made of bainite or perlite, the steel is once again moved to the oxygenate area and cooled slowly to a controlled temperature before it is completely quenched to a low temperature
 Let

 The alloy is then cooled to a sufficiently high rate to prevent the alloying elements from breaking out of the solution
 This alloy is then tempered, for which it is heated to a temperature lower than the solute temperature

 Acharya Kanad, the first person to throw light on the atomic structure of Acharya Kanad, was born in 600 BC
 His name is still associated with Dolton, because earlier Kanad had told that matter is made of very fine particles
 His idea was philosophical
 , He named these microscopic particles atoms
 Later Dolton introduced the theory of atoms
 Call atoms in English language atom
 This is what Kanad said- "if a substance is divided repeatedly and continues to divide until it cannot further divide, then this tiny particle is called an atom
 Atoms do not remain independently
 It is not possible to destroy the atom

 samadesh yaa 'vyadesh' vah aadesh he jise nyaayalay apane samta sambandhi adhikaron ke antargat kisi paksh yaa nigam ke naam kisi ko karne ke liye, kisi kaam ko karne ke liye, kisi kaam ko karne se rokane ke liye vaa koi aisa kaam karte rahane ke liye jari karata he jise karne yaa na karne kii use baadhyataa ho
 This order of the court applies to the individual personally
 Violation of this order is considered defamation of the court
 yadi koi vyakti is dhang kii manahani kare to uski sampatti jabt kar liye jane kii vyavastha he
 Under the Indian Legislation, in cases where punishment of a person or confiscation of property is not effective, in those cases, according to Civil Procedure Code Order 21 Rule 32, the court can order any person receiving the decree or any other person to perform the prescribed work
 is sthiti main ukt kaary sampadan karne kaa puraa vyay us vyakti ko vahan karnaa padegaa, jise mulat: ukt kaary puraa karne kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 The command can be acceptable and also prohibitive
 sweekaaratmak vaa aadeshaatmak samadesh ke dwaara prativaadee ko koi aisa kaary karne kaa aadesh diya jaataa he jise karnaa kanoonee drushti se uske liye laazmi he
 By the injunctive or restraining order, the defendant is ordered to retire from doing any work or maintaining a position
 samadesh kaa sweekaaratmak vaa nisheghaatmak rup main vibhaajan us kaary ke swaroop par nirbhar karata he jiske sambandh main nyaayik nirdesh jari kiya jaae
 There are again two divisions of the command - interchangeable and permanent
 is dhang kaa vibhaajan do baton kaa dhyaan main rakhkar kiya jaataa he- ek to yah ki aadesh kii yah avadhi kitni he or duusari baat yah he ki nyaayik prakriya kii kis avasthaa main aadesh jari kiya gaya he
 It can be said broadly that the interlocutory order is one which is effective till the completion of the hearing of the case
 sthaayee samadesh maamle kii sunwaayee puri hone ke baad aavashyatanusaar jari kii jaati he
 The issuance of a permanent injunction means to permanently deprive the defendant of any such right or prevent him from doing any act which is against the rights of the plaintiff
 bahut aavashyaktaa hone par prativaadee kaa bayaan liye bina keval vaadi ke aavedan par hi ekapaksheeya samadesh bhi jari kii ja sakati he
 But the unilateral order issued in this manner will remain temporary until the defendant submits to give his statement as per the information
 bhartiya nyaayalayon main is samay jin nyaayik upachaaron kii vyavastha he, ve sabhi nahin to unamem se adhiktar aise hai jo angreji nyaay vyavastha se le liye gaye the
 In the middle of the 19th century, there were two types of courts related to the said judiciary and the second court was the Samyam Court, also called the Court of Chancery
 saamaanya vidhaan ke nyaayalay rajya ke samaanya nyaayalay the
 The judiciary in these courts was based on the ancient customs of the country
 un pracheen ritirivaajon ko hi saamaanya nyaay kii sangya de di gai thi
 Used to live in the court of general or parity
 sthool rup se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki saamaanya nyaay main jo trutiyaan thim, samya ke siddhant par aadhaarit nyaay vyavastha main unka niraakaran se spasht ho jaati he
 According to the general justice, all kinds of damages were done by money
 mana k ke paas ek acre jameen he jo 'kha' kii jameen se mili hui he or 'k' 'kha' se is aashay kaa qaraar karata he ki vah use 'kha' ko vah jameen qaraar kii tithi se chha: maheene ke baad bech degaa evam hastantarit kar degaa
 Then after one month of this first agreement, 'A', if he sold the land to a third person 'C', then in this situation, the general law could only order the liquid to compensate for the damage caused by breaking the agreement
 
 duusari ore is dhang kii sthiti main samya kaa nyaayalay samadesh jari karke 'k' ko keval is baat se roak hi nahin saktaa tha ki vah 'ga' ko jameen na beche apitu is baat kaa vishisht nirdesh bhi kar saktaa tha ki ukt bhoomi upyukt samay par 'kha' ko bech or hastantarit kar di jaae
 This makes it clear how much was needed to remove the flaws in this form of general legislation
 saath hi isse samta sambandhi nyaay ke adhikarashetra kii seemaa kaa bhi pataa chal jaataa he
 In situations in which economic returns are equally useful, special remedies will not be used under parity
 kintu yadi nyaas yaa is prakaar ke anya adhikaar kaa ulanghan hota ho or saamaanya vidhaan main ukt adhikaar bhang kii abhigna na ho, us sthiti main samya ke antargat vishesh upachaaron kii vyavastha he
 This theory and its related sub-principles will be found everywhere in the field of command law
 bhartiya ucch nyaayalayon ke vibhinan shashapatron ke madhyam se bahut se anya upachaaron ke saath saath samadesh jari karne kii vyavastha bhi england se hi bharat main laai gai he
 Part III of the Specific Deprivation Act of India 1877 mentions the elemental rules governing the command
 prakriya sambandhi kuch baton kaa vivechan civil prasodyu ral code ov india main kiya gaya he
 If the defendant infringes on the property rights of the plaintiff or deprives the plaintiff of the property's consumption or threatens to act in this manner, the court may issue a permanent injunction to the defendant in the following situations: Of the trustee of the property or when there is no means of knowing that the infringement of the property rights of the plaintiff by the defendant is actually a How much damage has been done, or where the damage is of such a manner that substantial deviation from the capital by its substance is not possible, or where there is a possibility that the supply of the damage is not provable by the substance, or where the extension of the judicial process is prevented It has become necessary to issue a command
 vidhayak sanstha ko aavedan karne se kisi vyakti ko samadesh nahin roak sakati, sarkaar ke kisi vibhaag dwaara sampadit kiye janevaale prajasambandhi kaaryon main bhi samadesh hastkshep nahin kar sakati, kisi videshi sarkaar ke rajsambandhi kaaryon main bhi samadesh hastkshep nahin kar sakati, aparaadh sambandhi maamalon kii sunwaayee ko bhi samadesh dwaara nahin roka ja saktaa or na hi samadesh dwaara kisi ko aisa qaraar todane se roka ja saktaa he jiske nirvaah ke liye vah vishesh rup se patibaddh na ho
 If the applicant, by his own permission or by any of his behavior, makes himself an officer of the command, in that case the command will not be issued in favor of that person
 saamanyat: kisi sarkari vibhaag ko kartavyapaalan se nahin roka ja sakati lekin iskaa arth yah nahin he ki bhartiya nyaayalay sarkaar ko yaa sarkaar ke kisi vibhaag ko avaidhanik kaary karne se yaa karte rahane se nahin roak sakate
 Sometimes a command is necessary to maintain a contract
 kintu aisi sthiti main yah aavashyak he ki us qaraar kaa vishisht rup se nirvaah sambhav ho sake
 This has caused some difficulty in contracting personal services
 saamanyat: vyaktigat sevaaon ke qaraar vishisht rup se jabaran karyanvit nahin karaae jate
 For example, if a famous singer contracts for five years in a auditorium called 'A' and also agrees that he will not sing elsewhere in this period, but only after one year has passed
 In case of refusal to sing in the auditorium, the court will not specifically give permission to the singer to sing in the auditorium of 'A'
 kintu nishedhaatmak ajna pradaan kar nyaayalay nirdhaarit avadhi samaapt hone tak us gayak ko anyatra gane se roak saktaa he
 Some judges are of the view that there is no need for injunctive covenant in so many words when on the other hand it is expressed that even where there is a clear prohibitive covenant, the court may not allow its execution even if it so By doing so, the covenanter is forced to forcibly stop his work
 bharat main vishisht avamukti adhinium ke khand 57 main die gaye 'si' tathaa 'di' udaahranon se ek spasht drushtikon vyakt ho jaataa he
