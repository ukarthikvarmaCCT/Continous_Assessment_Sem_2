 Korozok is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery belonging to the Drupa lineage
 yah korozoke gaanv main sthit he, leh jila, ladakh, bharat main tso moriri ke uttar-pashchimi bank par sthit he
 At 4,560 meters, Gompa holds a Shakamuni Buddha and other sculptures

 It is an independent monastery under Korozok Rinpoche, widely known as Langna Rinpoche

 This revered monastery is 300 years old
 neeche tso moriri jhil bhi shraddhey main yojit kii jaati he, or sthaneey logon dwaara samaan rup se pavitra mana jaataa he
 Through the efforts of wwf-india, Tsomoriri has been concocted by the local community as a 'sacred gift to a living planet'
 natijatan, is kshetra ko paryatakon ke liye khol diya gaya he
 The word ‘korozok’ is a derivative of two words, namely ‘kor’ is a place in Ladakhi language and the word ‘zok’ which is said to be a derivative of the word ‘dzot-pa’ which means “manager”
 varshon main, shabd kaa aakhri patr 'ke' main badalakar vyutpann shabd 'zok' or 'korozoke' ke rup main janaa jane laga
 Another explanation is that the shepherds who worked for the monasteries in the nearby areas kept the king's cattle at this place, not only to extract them but also milk, cheese and butter
 isliye, jagah "kosok" ke rup main janaa jane laga
 It is said that nomads were used by the monasteries because they were paid a very small amount for services
 isliye is sthaan ko 'korozoke' naam diya gaya tha 
 The history of Korozok leads to kings who ruled in orphaned areas and fought many wars
 yuddh main unhen kai asafalataaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa or algaav main ek khanaabadosh jivan kaa netritv karnaa padaa
 One of the kings of this nomadic dynasty sent his envoy to Tibet for help
 He brought lamas from Tibet who established the monastery in Korozok about 300 years ago
 tab se khanaabadosh apane animastic dharm ko badalane or buddha dharm ko apnaanaa pasand karte the

 raajaaon main se ek, rupshu goba, jo apane parivaar ke saath rahete the, ne nau sthaayee ghar banaae
 The village has several houses, but the temporary population in the summer, setting up their tents in the summer, adds to agricultural operations in the region
 dhuen ko baahar jane ke liye tent ke sheersh par chhidr hai pashmina ek moolyawaan utpaada he, jo ki changmaj ke vyapaar main namak ke saath-saath kshetra main bade namak kshetron se nikaale jate hai, jaise pouga main springs

 Barley fields in the vicinity of the village of Corazok claim to be the most cultivated land in the world due to pasture by the chang-pa shepherds

 bhashaa kaa prashn maanviya he, khaskar bharat main, jahaan samrajyavaadee bhashaa janata ko janatantr se alag kar rahi he
 The rivalry of Hindi and English has changed into the duality of the native languages and the national language, the sutra connecting the minds has been dubbed the sword, the language of subjugation has become the pride of independence
 nishchay hi iske peeche das man kii sakriyata he
 What a strange feeling it is when someone agitates, give us slavery, clothe it! bhashaa ke bare main hamaara soch or ravaiya vahi he jo jivan ke bare main he
 Is there any value left that language and self-respect are left? i think it is useless to curse politics, bureaucracy, capitalism or imperialism now; As long as the public does not see its own interests and interests, nothing will change
 isliye koi bhi samasya ho, vah sidhe janata ko nivedit yaa sambodhit honi chahie
 By handing people divisive conspiracies, we are not creating any sensation, any heartiness within the language

 There is no competition in Hindi from native languages
 vah unhen phoolate-falte dekhnaa chaahati he, unase atmalap karnaa chaahati he
 The national language hesitates to say anything about Hindi, because luckily or unfortunately we are Hindi speakers, whereas we have not chosen to be
 hindi ko rashtrabhasha banane kaa swapn bhi hindibhashiyon kaa nahin tha
 The need for this as the national language was first experienced by non-speakers
 hindibhashiyon ne to unke swar main swar milaayaa, taaki unhen naakaara na maan liya jaae
 Yet the irony is that they are accused of imposing Hindi or establishing Hindi imperialism
 yah hindi ham par kisne thopi he ? hamaari hindi to santon-bhakton kii god main pali he, aaj tak kabhi vah satta kii mohataaj nahin rahi
 In the words of Makhanlal Chaturvedi, she has been despised by thrones

 She has no desire to become a Tamga, yet she has definitely become the country's flute, sword and shield

 When Gandhiji gave his first speech in Hindi on his return from Africa and some people objected, he said that i am not speaking in Hindi but in the language of India
 hindi main hi subhaashachandr bose kii lalkaar dason dishaao main goonji thi
 Perhaps by remembering these services, Hindi was given respect for the national language and the official language in the constitution of independent India

 First of all, you are being snatched away from your language, so that in any case you are not able to maintain mutual intimacy, like aggression forces blow up bridges

 The Japanese, the Chinese Jews, and even the British themselves, used the languages of the conquerors as weapons in their subjugation period, which they all threw away after independence
 aaj bhi africa nigro, goron ke viruddh angreji main hi sahitya likh rahe hai, parantu isaki teevr vednaa unke sahitya main jhalkati he
 That is why they are busy making their own language through their own dialects

 In our country since independence, such webs of mischief about Hindi have been spread continuously
 unheen kaa parinaam he ki hindi aaj tak apana anivaary aitihaasik sthaan nahin paa saki he
 To my knowledge, in an important independent nation, its national language was not deposed for so long
 yahan to sthiti yah he ki yah silsilaa lagaataar tej hota ja rahaa he
 We will consider in the next pages why this situation has arisen, what have been the reasons for it, but today the mindset of the common educated people of the country has been so polluted that sometimes it seems that about the national language Talking and communal rioting is the same thing
 aisi krur or gulam maansikta paidakarne vaale log hi aaj badi hasarat se angrej or angreji raaj ko yaad karte hai-isse kya yah sabit nahin hota ki bharat main angrejon or angreji raaj kii bhoomika ko alag karnaa saraasar nasamajhi dikhaanaa he
 We were horribly missed in the early fragile and emotional period of independence, showing perceived generosity
 tab kya pataa tha ki hindi ke saath 15 varsho tak angreji jari karne kaa nirnay hindi ko apdasth karne kii bhoomika sabit hoga
 In this interval, the British bureaucrats, selfish politicians, foreign powers, the mean capitalists, etc
, had devised their strategy and had further attacked the national language by advancing Indian languages and regionalism
 itihaas main bhi ham dekh chuke hai ki maamuli chhot ke sahare hi east india company ne bharat main apana jaal failaayaa tha or baad main samast deshi rajyon ko ek-ek kar hadapte hue sampurna samprabhutaa hasil kar lee thi
 That character is English - as an official language

 In this regard, he ignored the old advice that should enable Hindi, why do we resist the English? ' Lohia knew what the implications of this showy non-violent advice were? In fact, maintaining any foreign language as the national language is like maintaining independence as an option for independence

 For example, the targets of the bullets and other missiles being released from the tank are pre-determined and they fall there
 yaa phir leisure gided bam yaa missile hote hai jo lager kirnon ke aadhaar par lakshya ko sadhate hai
 But if a target is away from all this and is constantly moving, then it can be difficult to target it
 yaheen yah takanic kaam aati he

 India is also building its indigenous subsonic missile Nirbhay

 But the development of a longer range missile is not possible with Russia because Russia is a signatory to the International Missile Technology Control Treaty
 isse vah 300 kimi se adhik maarak kshamta vaali missile ke vikaas main anya deshon ko madad nahin de saktaa he
 On 18 December 2009, India successfully test-fired the brahmos supersonic cruise missile in the Bay of Bengal on Thursday

 dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan bharat ke pratham up-raashtrapati or dwitiya raashtrapati rahe
 He was a pioneer of Indian culture, an eminent educationist, a great philosopher and a devout Hindu thinker
 unke inhen gunon ke kaaran san 1954 main bharat sarkaar ne unhen sarvocch sammaan bharat ratna se alankrita kiya tha
 His birthday is celebrated as Teachers' Day in India
 dow radhakrishnan kaa janm tamilnadu ke tirutani gram main, jo tatkaaleen madras se lagbhag 64 ki me kii duuri par sthit he, 5 sitambar 1888 ko hua tha
 The family he was born into was a Brahmin family
 unka janm sthaan bhi ek pavitra tirthasthal ke rup main vikhyath rahaa he
 Radhakrishnan's ancestors had previously lived in a village called 'sarvepalli' and in the mid-18th century they had migrated towards the village of Tirutani
 lekin unke purakhe chaahate the ki unke naam ke saath unke janmasthal ke gram kaa bodh bhi sadaiv rahanaa chaiye
 That is why his family started wearing 'sarvapalli' before his name
 dow radhakrishnan ek garib kintu vidwaan brahman kii santaan the
 His father's name was 'sarvepalli Veeraswamy' and mother's name was 'sitamma'
 unke pita rajasav vibhaag main kaam karte the
 He was responsible for the maintenance of a very large family
 veeraswami ke paanch putr tathaa ek putree thi
 Radhakrishnan's place was second among these descendants
 unke pita kaafii kathinaayee ke saath parivaar kaa nirvahan kar rahe the
 Due to this, the child Radhakrishnan did not get any special pleasure in childhood
 radhakrishnan kaa balykaal tirutani evam tirupati jaise dharmik sthalon par hi vyateet hua
 He spent the first eight years in Tirutani
 yadhyapi unke pita puraane vichaaron ke the or unamem dharmik bhavanaayen bhi thim, iske baavjood unhone radhakrishnan ko chrishchiyan mishanri sanstha luthern mishan skool, tirupati main 1896-1900 ke madhya vidyadhyayan ke liye bheja
 Then for the next 4 years he was educated in Vellore
 iske baad unhone madras chrishchiyan college, madras main shiksha praapt kii
 He was brilliant since childhood
 in 12 varshon ke adhyayan kaal main radhakrishnan ne bible ke mahatvapurn ansh bhi yaad kar liye
 For this, he was awarded the honor of special merit
 is umr main unhone vir saavarkar or swami vivekananda kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 He passed the matriculation level examination in 1902 and also received a scholarship
 iske baad unhone 1904 main kala sankaay pariksha pratham shrenee main uteern kii
 He also received special merit remarks in psychology, history and mathematics due to his high scores
 iske alaava chrishchiyan college, madras ne unhen chaatravrutti bhi di
 After doing his MA in Philosophy in 1916, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Madras Residency College
 baad main usee college main ve praadhyaapak bhi rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan introduced the Indian philosophy to the world through his writings and speeches
 saare vishwa main unke lekhon kii prashansa kii gayi
 At that time, in the Brahmin families of Madras, marriage was completed at an early age and Radhakrishnan was no exception
 1903 main 16 varsh kii aayu main hi unka vivaah dur ke rishte kii bahan 'sivaakamu' ke saath sampann ho gaya
 At that time his wife was only 10 years old
 atah teen varsh baad hi unki patni ne unke saath rahanaa armbh kiya
 Although his wife Sivakamu was not traditionally educated, he had good authority over the Telugu language
 vah angrezi bhashaa bhi likh-pard sakati thim
 In 1908, the Radhakrishnan couple received a daughter as a child
 1908 main hi unhone kala snaatak kii oopaadhi pratham shrenee main praapt kii or darshan shaastra main vishisht yogyata praapt kii
 In 1909, after six years of marriage, he also passed the postgraduate examination in Arts
 inkaa vishay darshan shaastra hi rahaa
 He also continued to teach tuition to children for his personal income during higher studies
 1908 main unhone em0 e0 kii oopaadhi praapt karne ke liye ek shodh lekh bhi likhaa
 At this time, he was only twenty years old
 isse shastron ke prati unki gyaan-pipaasa badi
 Soon he also studied Vedas and Upanishads deeply
 iske atirikt unhone hindi or sanskrit bhashaa kaa bhi ruchipurvak adhyayan kiya
 While education definitely has an impact on every individual, the quality of an educational institution also leaves an impact
 chrishchiyan sansthaaon dwaara us samay pashchimi jivan mulyon ko vidhyaarthiyon ke bheetar kaaphi gaharaai tak sthapit kiya jaataa tha
 This is the reason that while studying in Christian institutions, Radhakrishnan's life had high qualities
 lekin unamem ek anya parivartan bhi aayaa jo ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon ke kaaran hi tha
 Some people used to view Hindutva ideas and criticize them
 unki aalochana ko dow radhakrishnan ne chunauti kii tarah liya or hindu shastron kaa gaharaa adhyayan karnaa armbh kar diya
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan wanted to know that in which culture ideas really are conscious and in which culture ideas are rooted? Then by natural intuition started to believe strongly that the poor and illiterate people living in remote places of India also knew the ancient truth
 is kaaran radhakrishnan ne tulanaatmak rup se yah jaan liya ki bhartiya aadhyatm kaafii samrudh he or chrishchiyan mishnariyon dwaara hindutv kii aalochanaayen niraadhaar hai
 From this he concluded that Indian culture is based on religion, knowledge and truth which gives the true message of life to the creature
 dow radhakrishnan ne yah bhalee bhanti jaan liya tha ki jivan bahut hi chota he parantu isamen vyaapt khushiyaan anishchit hai
 For this reason, a person should live happily and comfortably
 vastutah mrityu ek atal sachai he, jo amir garib sabhi ko apana grass banaati he tathaa kisi prakaar kaa varg bhed nahin karti
 True knowledge is the only one who can eliminate the ignorance inside you
 sadgipurn santoshavritti kaa jivan amiron ke ahamkaari jivan se behatar he, jinamein asantosh kaa nivas he
 a quiet mind is better than those thunderous applause; Which are heard in parliaments and courts
 vastut: isi kaaran dow radhakrishnan bhartiya samskruti ke naitik mulyon ko samaj paane main safal rahe, kyonki ve mishnariyon dwaara kii gai aalochanaon ke satya ko swayan parakhnaa chaahate the
 That is why criticisms are said to be acts of purification
 sabhi matayen apane bacchon main ucch sanskaar dekhnaa chaahati hai
 For this reason, they teach children how to believe in God, stay away from sin and help those who are in trouble
 dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah bhi janaa ki bhartiya samskruti main sabhi dharmon kaa aadar karnaa sikhaaya gaya he or sabhi dharmon ke liye samta kaa bhav bhi hindu samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan he
 Thus he understood the specific identity of Indian culture and became very close to it
 dow radhakrishnan samooche vishwa ko ek vidhyalay maanate the
 He believed that only through education can the human mind be properly utilized
 at: vishwa ko ek hi ikai maanakar shiksha kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 In his speech at the University of Edinburgh, UK, Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had said - "man should be one
 maanav itihaas kaa sampurna lakshya maanav jati kii mukti tabhi sambhav he jab deshon kii nitiyon kaa aadhaar puure vishwa main shaanti kii sthapana kaa praytn ho
 "dr
 Radhakrishnan used to enchant the students with his wit-filled explanations, joyful expressions and mildly tickling stories
 ucch naitik mulyon ko apane aacharan main utaarne kii prerana vah apane chaatro ko bhi dete the
 Whatever subject he taught, he himself studied it deeply
 darshan jaise gambheer vishay ko bhi vah apni style se saral, rochak or priy bana dete the
 In 1909, at the age of 21, Dr
 Radhakrishnan started teaching philosophy as a junior lecturer in Madras Presidency College
 yah unka param saubhaahgya tha ki unako apni prakruti ke anukool aajeevika praapt hui thi
 Here he not only did teaching work for 7 years but also studied Indian philosophy and Indian religion deeply
 un dinon vyaakhyaata ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki adhyaapan hetu vah shikshan kaa prashikshan bhi praapt kare
 That is why in 1910 Radhakrishnan started taking training in Madras
 is samay inkaa vetan maatr 37 rupee tha
 Radhakrishnan, the then Professor of Philosophy Department, was greatly overwhelmed by the philosophy of classical knowledge
 unhone unhen darshan shaastra kii kakshaon se anupasthit rahane kii anumati pradaan kar di
 But instead, it was conditioned that he should teach in philosophy classes instead
 tab radhakrishna ne apane kaksha saathiyon ko teraa aise prabhaavshaalee vyaakhyaan diye, jinase ve shikshaarthi bhi chakit rah gayi
 The reason for this was that he had a deep grip on the subject, his approach to philosophy was clear and he had also chosen the appropriate words while giving lectures
 1912 main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan kii "manovigyaan ke aavashyak tatv" sheershak se ek laghu pustika bhi prakashit hui jo kaksha main diye gayi unke vyakhyanon kaa sangrah tha
 This qualification was proved by this booklet that "not only do they have a rich store of words to explain every verse, their memory power is also very unique
 " When Dr
 Radhakrishnan returned to India from Europe and America, then various universities here honored him by awarding him honorary degrees
 1928 kii sheet ritu main inaki pratham mulaaqaat pandit jawahar laal nehru se us samay hui, jab vah congress party ke vaarshik adhiveshan main sammilit hone ke liye kalakatta aae hue the
 Although Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan could not participate in any political discourse as a member of the Indian Educational Service, he did not care for this taboo and gave a speech
 1929 main inhen vyaakhyaan dene hetu 'maanchester vishvavidhyalay' dwaara aamantrit kiya gaya
 He gave many lectures in Manchester and London
 inaki shiksha sambandhi uplabdhiyon ke daayre main nimnavat sansthanik seva kaaryon ko dekha jaataa he- Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan did the same and put his address to rest at 12 o'clock at night
 pandit nehru or radhakrishnan ke alaava kisi anya ko isaki jaankaree nahin thi
 After independence, he was requested to fulfill diplomatic work with the Soviet Union as a distinguished ambassador to serve the motherland
 is prakaar vijayalakshmi pandit kaa inhen nayaa uttaradhikari chunaa gaya
 Pandit Nehru's selection prompted many to wonder why a philosopher was chosen for diplomatic services? He suspected that the abilities of Dr
 Radhakrishnan were not compatible with the responsibility assigned to him
 lekin baad main sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah sabit kar diya ki moscow main niyukt bhartiya rajanyikon main ve sabase behatar the
 He was a non-traditional diplomat
 jo mantranaayen der raatri hoti thim, ve unamem raatri 10 baje tak hi bhaag lete the, kyonki uske baad unke shayan kaa samay ho jaataa tha
 Even when Radhakrishnan was a teacher, he was not bound by rules
 kaksha main yah 20 minute deree se aate the or das minute purv hi chale jate the
 They said that the lectures they had to give in class were completed in enough time of 20 minutes
 iske uparant bhi yah vidhyaarthiyon ke priy evam aadarneey shikshak bane rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was elected Vice President after his arrival from the Soviet Union in 1952
 samvidhan ke antargat uparashtrapati kaa nayaa pad srujit kiya gaya tha
 Nehru again surprised the people by choosing Radhakrishnan for this post
 unhen aashcharya tha ki is pad ke liye congress party ke kisi raajnneetijna kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Radhakrishnan also served as the Speaker in the Rajya Sabha as Vice President
 san 1952 main ve bharat ke uparashtrapati banaaye gayi
 Later this selection of Pandit Nehru also proved to be meaningful, because a non-politician as Vice President influenced all politicians
 sansad ke sabhi sadasyon ne unhen unke kaary vyavhaar ke liye kaafii saraahaa
 People still remember his generosity, perseverance and humorous nature
 hamaare desh ke dwitiya kintu adwitiya raashtrapati dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ke janm din ko prativarsh 'shikshak diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 On this day, awards are also given to the best teachers in the entire country by the Government of India
 yadhyapi unhen 1931 main british samrajya dwaara "sar" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gayi thi lekin swatantrata prapti ke pashchaat uskaa auchity dow radhakrishnan ke liye samaapt ho chukaa tha
 When he became the vice-president, the first President of independent India, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad ji, in 1954 gave him the country's highest decoration Bharat Ratna for his great philosophical and educational achievements

 banjarmacin kii ek sadak a Mall of Banjarmasin suriunsyah masjid River bank manusmriti hindu dharm kaa ek pracheen dharamshastra he
 It is also known by the names Manav dharma-shastra, Manushahita etc
 yah upadesh ke rup main he jo manu dwaara rishiyon ko diya gaya
 Subsequent theologians have followed Manusmriti as a reference
 dharamshastreey granthkaaron ke atirikt shankaracharya, shabaraswami jaise darshanik bhi pramanroopen is granth ko uddhrut karte hai
 Traditionally, this memory is composed by Swayambhuva Manu, not by Vaivasvata Manu or oriental Manu
 manusmriti se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki swyambhuv manu ke mulashastra kaa aashray kar bhrigu ne us smriti kaa upavrihan kiya tha, jo prachlit manusmriti ke naam se prasiddh he
 Like this 'bhargaviya Manusmriti', 'nardiya Manusmriti' is also popular
 manusmriti vah dharamshastra he jisaki manyata jagavikhyath he
 Decisions have been made on the basis of its evidence not only in India but also in foreign countries and even today
 atah dharamshastra ke rup main manusmriti ko vishwa kii amuly nidhi mana jaataa he
 After the Vedas in India, 'manusmriti' is the most recognized and practiced
 isamen chaaron varnon, chaaron ashramon, solah sanskaron tathaa sristi utpatti ke atirikt rajya kii vyavastha, raja ke kartavya, bhaanti-bhaanti ke vivaadon, sena kaa prabandh aadi un sabhi vishyon par paraamarsh diya gaya he jo ki maanav maatr ke jivan main ghatit hone sambhav he
 All this religious system is based on the Veda
 manu maharaj ke jivan or unke rachanakaal ke vishay main itihaas-puraana spasht nahin hai
 However, everyone accepts with one voice that Manu was a primitive man and this scripture is his scripture
 ‘manusmriti’ bhartiya samskruti kaa abhinn ang he
 It is counted in such texts of the world, from which humans have gained inspiration for personal behavior and society
 isamen prashn keval dharmik aasthaa yaa vishwaas kaa nahin he
 Every social person has this expectation and aspiration to meet the needs of human life, in any way, by mutual cooperation and in an elegant way
 videshon main is vishay par paryaapt khoj hui he, tulanaatmak adhyayan hua he or samalochanaayen bhi hui hai
 Its place in Hindu society is after Vedatrayi
 manusmriti ke bahut se sanskaran uplabdh hai
 In time, many interpolations are also natural
 saadhaaran vyakti ke liye yah sambhav nahin he ki vah baad main sammilit hue anshon kii pahchaan kar sake
 Only an official scholar can do this after comparative studies
 antoni read kehete hai ki burma, thailand, cambodia, java-bali aadi main dharamshastron or pramukhtah manusmriti, kaa bada aadar tha
 In these countries, these texts were considered to be natural laws and the kings were expected to conduct themselves accordingly
 in granthon kaa pratilipikaran kiya gaya, anuwaad kiya gaya or sthaneey kanoonon main inako sammilit kar liya gaya
 a book memorial called 'bible in India' Louis Jacquilot writes: manusmriti ke kaal evam praneta ke vishay main naveen anusandhankaree vidwaanon ne paryaapt vichaar kiya he
 Some people believe that this memory was named Manusmriti, because it was active in the "human" stage
 koi kehete hai ki manusmriti se pehle koi 'maanav dharmasutra' tha jiskaa aashray lekar kisi ne ek mul manusmriti banaai thi jo baad main upbrunhit hokar vartmaan rup main prachlit ho gai
 Many answers of Manusmriti are considered even when considering for them many of the ideas or sentences which are not found in ancient texts like Nirukta, Mahabharata etc
 is prakaar ke anek tathyon kaa boohaler, pandurang vaaman kane aadi vidwaanon ne paryaapt vivechan kiya he
 It seems quite logical that the theological sentences with the name of Manu were prevalent in the society, whose instructions are in the Mahabharata etc
 and the words of which the present Manushahita was taken by taking shelter, as well as the name of an ancient sage named Bhrigu for fame
 Added to it
 manu se pehle bhi dharamshastrakaar the, yah manu ke "ete" aadi shabdon se hi gyaat hua he
 Kautilya mentions "manavaah"
 vidwaanon ke anusaar manu parampara kii pracheenta hone par bhi vartmaan manusmriti isa purv chaturth shatabdi se pracheen nahin ho sakati, yah baat yavan, shaq, kamboj, china aadi jatiyon ke nirdesh se gyaat hoti he
 It is also certain that the present form of memory had become strong by the second century BCE and no rites were performed after this period
 manusmriti bhartiya aachaar-samhita kaa vishwakosh he, manusmriti main baarah adhyay tathaa do hajaar paanch sau shloke hai, jinamein sristi kii utpatti, sanskaar, nity or naimitthik karm, ashramadharm, varndharm, rajdharm va praayshchit aadi vishyon kaa ullekh he

 There are many beautiful things in Manusmriti, from personal mindfulness to the whole social system, which can guide us even today
 janm ke aadhaar par jati or varna kii vyavastha par sabase pehali chot manusmriti main hi kii gai he 
 It is also a matter of education for all and to receive the most education
 striyon kii puja karne arthath unhen adhikadhik sammaan dene, unhen kabhi shok na dene, unhen hameshaa prasann rakhane or sampatti kaa vishesh adhikaar dene jaisi baaten bhi hai 
 The king has been told not to force the subjects to do anything
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki praja ko hameshaa nirbhayata mahasoos honi chahie 
 There has been talk of non-violence towards everyone
 manu par kai vyakhyaayein prachlit hai- The names of many commentators of Manu are known, whose commentaries are now extinct, such as - helpless, Bhartriyajna, Yajva, Upadhyaya Riju, Vishnuswamy, Udayakar, Bharuchi or Bhaguri, Bhojdev Dharanidhar etc
 bharat main vedon ke uparant sarvaadhik manyata or prachlan ‘manusmriti’ kaa hi he
 In this, apart from the four varnas, the four ashrams, sixteen rites and the creation of creation, the system of the state, the king's duty, all kinds of disputes, the management of the army, etc
 have been consulted on all those topics which are possible in the life of human beings
 All this religion is based on the Vedas
 manu maharaj ke jivan or unke rachanakaal ke vishay main itihaas-puraana spasht nahin hai
 However, everyone accepts with one voice that Manu was a primitive man and his scripture is Adi Shastra
 kyonki manu kii samast manyataayen satya hone ke saath-saath desh, kaal tathaa jati bandhanon se rahit hai

 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi

 upss are different from auxiliary power sources such as standby generators, etc
 in the case that when power goes out they interfere with the power received by the concerned equipment for a negligible time, so that the work of that device is not interrupted or hindered

 a simple description of hormonal puberty is as follows: is neurohormonal prakriya kii shuruyaat pehle pratyaksh shaareerik parivartan se 1-2 saal pehle ho sakati he
 The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is the operator of the reproductive system

 adrenal androgen donon lingon main guptang ke baalo, vayask sharir gandh evam anya androgenic parivartanon ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 The primary medical significance of the difference between adrenarche and gonadarche is that these changes such as the hair and body odor of the genitals do not prove that a child is undergoing puberty
