 Ever since England seized Scotland and merged it with the British Empire, there has been a sense of rebellion in Scotland - which has become moderate and intense at times
 skin ke pathar kii landan main maujuudagi ko bahut se scot log apni gulaami kaa pratik maanate the
 Therefore, in view of these Scotty sentiments in 1996, the British Government decided that the stone of the schoon would be laid in Scotland and London would be brought only when a new chef or queen was to be crowned
 khaataa-bahi yaa lager us mukhya bahi ko kehete hai jisamen paise ke len-dein kaa hisaab rakhaa jaataa he
 Nowadays it is also in the form of a computer-file
 khaataa bahi main sabhi len-dein ko khaataa ke anusaar likhaa jaataa he jisamen debit or credit ke ke do alag-alag kollam hote hai
 One objective of accounting is to easily determine what the trader has to give to his creditors, what he has to take from his debtors, his expenses and income etc
 yah bhi spasht he ki yah jaankaree keval rojnaama main saudon ke likhane maatr se hi turant praapt nahin ho sakati
 Suppose a person wants to know what to take or give from 'A', then he will have to see the entire scroll to find the entries related to 'A', because he has bought the goods from him many times and has given him money many times
 
 yadi yahi tarika apane saath vyavhaar karne vaale prayek vyakti yaa form ke saath apni sthiti maaloom karne ke liye prayog main laayaa jaay to vahi khate likhane kaa uddeshy antashah hi praapt hoga
 Apart from this, it will mean wasteful time, energy and money
 atah prayek vyakti athwa form se sambandhit sabhi pravishtiyon ko ek saath likhane ke liye koi twarit saadhan praapt karnaa chahie
 All this is done by collating and collating the entries in another book, called Khatabahi
 prayek vyakti se sambandhit un sabhi pravishtiyon ko jo ab tak rojnaama main vikhri padi thi ek jagah ekatrit evam sankshipt kiya jaataa he
 According to Batleboy, Khatabahi is the main book of accounts and in this book all the business transactions are divided in the end and get a place in their accounts
 picals ke anusaar, ‘khatabahi khaaton kii sabase mahatvapurn pusatak he or sahaayak pustakon main kii gai pravishtiyon kii manzil he
 It is essentially a collection of three types of accounts - real, personal and nominal
 uparyukt vivechan se yah puri tarah se spasht ho jaataa he ki khaataavhi pratham pravishti kii pustak nahin he kyonki koi bhi pravishti sidhi is prastak main nahin kii jaati he
 The entry is first made in the supporting books
 yah pramukh mahatva kii pusatak he
 In this, there are accounts related to all the transactions in the transaction
 yadhyapi aisa koi pakkaa niyam nahin he tathaapi saadharantaya khatabahi ke ek prishth main ek hi khaataa hota he
 This is done to remove impurities and clumsiness of the entire handwriting
 yadi khaaton kii sankhya bahut adhik ho to ek hi khatabahi main sab khaaton ko rakhana sambhav nahin ho saktaa
 In such a situation the book is divided into several departments or results
 udhaaharan ke liye rokad bahi khatabahi kaa hi ek upavibhaajan hai
 Cash deals are written in it
 khatabahi ko vibhajit karne kaa ek-tarika use vyaktig or avyaktigat yaa saadhaaran khatabahi main vibhajit karnaa he
 The individual ledger can be further subdivided into the ledger ledger account
 isi prakaar se khatabahi ko bhi vaastavik khatabahi or naam maatr khatabahi main upavibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes a personal account is maintained to maintain a capital account and a withdrawal account
 parantu company main aisi koi khatabahi nahin rakhi jaati he
 It should be noted that the above method is not the only one to subdivide the account
 vibhajit karne kii vidhiyaan prayek ke ke halaat par nirbhar karti he
 Each account is suggestive at the beginning
 saamanyata yah varnatmak abhisuchak hota he
 a page of the suffixer is assigned to a letter in the alphabet and the names that begin with it are written on the page assigned to that letter
 abhisuchak main prayek khate ke saamne khatabahi ke us prishth kii sankhya likh di jaati he jis par vah khaataa kholaa gaya he
 Many forms of ledger are found in business
 sarvasaamaanya praaroop main tithi, saude kaa vivaran, prishthank or dhanrashi ke liye stambh hote hai
 Additional cubic columns can be added to suit business needs
 praaroop kaa ek vaikalpik rup, jise bainko or kuch vyavsaayik sansthaaon me apaana jaataa he, vah he jiske khatabahi ke puure prishth ko chah stambhon main baant diya jaataa he
 These columns are - is vaikalpik praaroop kaa laabh yah he ki prayek saude ke uparant khate kaa shesh apane aap nikaala ja saktaa he shesh gyaat karne ke liye varsh kii samaapti tak pratiksha nahin kerani padati hai
 The process of making entries in the ledger from the booklet and other supporting books is called Khatauni
 rojnaama evam anya sahaayak pustakon main di gai pravishtiyon ke liye aadhaar banaati he
 Khatauni work does not require special skill as it is a normal type of work
 pravishtiyon ke rojnaama main likhane ke pashchaat khatabahi main khataya janaa chahie
 It is easier than the lettering of the journalists than the letter of the other supporting books
 rojnaama ke debit paksh ke dhan-raashi stambh main likhi gai dhanrashi ko khatabahi main sambandhit khate ke credit paksh me khataya jaataa he or credit paksh ke dhan-raashi stambh main likhi gai dhanrashi ko khatabahi main sambandhit khate ke credit paksh main khataya jaataa he
 Names of accounts are exchanged in the statement column of the ledger - the name of the account in which the money is debited
 khatabahi main duusare khate ke credit paksh ke vivaran stambh main likhaa jayega
 Similarly, the opposite is also true
 yah nimnlikhit udhaaharan dwaara samajha ja saktaa he
 a separate account of each creditor is opened in the ledger
 prayek kray kii dhan-raashi usase sambandhit vyaktigat khate main saadharantaya pratidin credit kii jaaegi
 The double-entry of this book will be completed by debiting the purchase account of the total purchases over a periodic sum
 khaataa pustak main prayek dendar kaa ek alag khaataa kholana hoga
 Generally, credit sales are maintained daily in individual accounts
 graahakon ke vaiyakti khate ko vikray kii dhanrashi se debit kiya jayega
 The sales account will be credited with the monthly sum of credit sales
 is prakaar is pustak kii dwi-pravishti purna kii jaaegi
 In Khatabhi every person to whom the goods have been returned is debited and at the end of the month the periodical sum of the returns is credited to the purchase return account in the ledger
 us prayek graahak ko jo maal lautaata he, credit kiya jaataa he or maheene ke ant main vikray-vaapasi pustak ke yoga ke vikray-vaapasi khate ko debit kiya jaataa he
 All the cash items are consumed in the ledger in the ledger
 rokad bahi ke debit paksh main likhi sabhi praptiyon ko sambandhit khaaton ke credit main ‘rokad se’, bank se’, ‘chhot se’ likhakar khataya jaataa he
 All payments written on the credit side of the cash book are debited to the respective accounts debit by writing 'from cash', 'with discount', from bank '
 rokad bahi ke debit paksh ke chhot satmbh ke yoga ko khatabahi main chhot khate ke debit paksh main likhaa jaataa he
 Because items are sourced on the credit side of individual accounts
 madon ko vyaktigat khaaton ke debit main khatai jane kii vajah se rokad bahi ke credit paksh ke chhot stambh ke yoga ko khatabahi main chhot khate ke credit paksh main likhaa jaataa he
 The account of the person from whom the exchange is received is credited with the money amount of the bill
 praapt vipatron ke masik yoga se khatabahi main prapya-vinimay-vipatr khaataa debit kiya jaataa he
 The account of the person to whom the bill is given is debited from the money amount of the bill
 dey vipatron ke masik yoga se khatabahi main dey vinimay vipatr khate ko credit kiya jaataa he
 a general entry is made to the analysis of retail expenditures indicated by the analytical columns of the retail cash book at periodic intervals
 prayek naam maatr ke khate ko uske sambindh yoga se debit kiya jaataa he or khudara rokad khaat avadhi main kiye gaye kul khudara vyayon kii se credit kiya jaat he
 In order to find out what to take from a particular person or what to give to a particular person, it is necessary to extract the balance of his personal account
 is prakriya ko khate band karnaa kehete hai
 To remove the balance of an account, the sum of both its sides is applied
 yadi donon paksh baraabar nahin hote, to donon pakshon ko baraabar karne ke liye antar kii kami vaale paksh main likh diya jaataa he
 The difference obtained in this way for writing on the deficient side is called the balance of that account
 yadi debit paksh kaa yoga credit paksh ke yoga se adhik he to shesh ko shthal thansandbam badhakashlikh kar credit paksh likh diya jaataa he
 In such case, that balance is called debit balance
 duusare varsh ke armbh main is shesh ko khaataa kholane samay shthal insandbam idhakashlikh kar debit paksh main likh diya jaataa he
 Similarly, if the sum of the credit side is more than the sum of the debit side, then the balance is written on the credit side by writing the latest insubam
 is shesh ko credit shesh kaahaa jaataa he
 Real accounts represent the assets of the business
 is khaaton ke shesh chitthey kii tithi par vyapaar ke adhikaar vaali sampattiyon kii dhan-raashi gyaat karne ke liye nikaale jate hai
 Their balance is also extracted in the same way
 jis prakaar vyaktigat khaaton kaa shesh nikaala jaataa he
 It should be noted that the balance of real accounts is always debited or no balance, ie their balance can never be a credit balance
 naam maatr khate vyapaar ke vyayon, haniyon aayon tathaa laabhon se sambandh rakhte hai
 Their balance is not removed
 vastutah inhen vyapaar khate athwa laabh-haani khate main sthaanantarit karke band kar diya jaataa he
 Comment khaaton kaa shesh nikaalte hue yaa usko band karte samay yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki donon pakshon kaa jod ek sidh main likhaa jaae
 If there is only one entry in the accounts then it is necessary to add
 pravishti ke neeche khichi dohari rekha kaa taatpary yah hoga ki vah pravishti hi swayan kaa jod he
 Similarly, if there is one entry on each side of the account with the same amount of money, then it would be unnecessary to add
 994 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 994 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 994 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 banaras gharaana bhartiya tabalaa vaadan ke chah prasiddh gharaanon main se ek he
 This gharana was developed some 200 years ago by the efforts of the famous Pandit Ram Sahai
 pandit ram sahay ne apane pita ke sang paanch varsh kii aayu se hi tabalaa vaadan aarambh kiya tha
 He came to Lucknow at the age of 9 and became a disciple of Modhu Khan of Lucknow Gharana
 jab ram sahay maatr 17 varsh ke hi the, tab lakhanu ke naye nawab ne modhu khan se poocha ki kya ram sahay unke liye ek pradarshan kar sakate hai? kehete hai, ki ram sahay ne 7 raaton tak lagaataar tabalaa-vaadan kiya jisaki prashansa puure samaaj ne kii evam un par bheton kii barsaat ho gayi
 Ram Sahai returned to Benaras after performing his talent
 kuch samay uparaant ram sahay ne paaramparik tabalaa vaadan main kuch badlaav kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii
 For the next six months, they became isolated and the result of this solitude came to the fore, which is today called banaras-baz

 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role
 anukulan kaa prakritik varan hi ek gyaat kaaran he, lekin kram-vikaas ke or bhi gyaat kaaran hai
 Other non-adaptive causes of micro-sequence evolution are mutation and genetic drift
 1842 main, charles darwin ne on da origin of spaciz kaa apana pehla sketch likhaa
 Main article: History of Evolutionism prastaav he ki ek prakaar kaa ek jeev duusare prakaar se utar saktaa he, kuch purv-secretic greek darshanikon jaise ki aneximundar or empodoclas main waapas jaataa he
 Such proposals survived into Roman times
 kavi or darshanik lucratius ne ampadocals ko apane masterwork di reram natura main dekha
 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types
 Give examples of life
 chijen aa sakati hai
 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 However, this new approach was slow to take root in biological science, the last bastion of the concept of definite natural types
 jon re ne nirdhaarit prakritik prakaaron, "prajatiyon" ke liye paudhon or jaanwaron ke prakaaron ke pehle se adhik saamaanya shabdon main se ek ko lagu kiya, lekin unhone prayek prakaar kii jivit chizon ko sakhti se ek prajati ke rup main pahachaanaa or prastaavit kiya ki prayek prajati ko un suvidhaon ke dwaara paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jo chakit ho peedi ke baad swayan peedi
 The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still in view of species determined according to a divine plan
 is samay ke anya prakrutivaadee samay par prakritik kanoonon ke anusaar prajatiyon ke vikasvaadi parivartan par anumaan lagaate hai
 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents
 Is obtained
 in vichaaron ko sthapit prakrutividon dwaara ninda kii gai thi kyonki anumaan lagaaya gaya tha ki anubhavjanya samarthan kii kami he
 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians

 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line

 Hereditary traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome is called its genotype
 ek jeev kii sanrachana or vyavhaar ko banane vaale anokhi lakshanon kaa puraa set use fanotip kaha jaataa he yah lakshan paryaavaran ke saath apane ginotip ke sampark se aate hai
 As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited

 However, relatively small differences in genotype can also lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differentiate in about 5% of their genomes
 mukhya lekh: utparivartan Repeat mutation of part of a chromosome is a change in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome
 jab utparivartan hote hai, ve ek jin ke utpaada ko badal sakate hai, yaa jin ko kaary karne se roak sakate hai, yaa iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, it has been suggested that if a gene changes the protein produced by the gene, it will likely be harmful, with approximately 70% of these mutations having a harmful effect, and the remaining neutral or weak forms

 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around
 yah, udhaaharan ke liye, kaaran jeev dhire-dhire sabhi ek hi oonchaai ban jaaenge
 a special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is the selection for any trait that enhances the success of sexual intercourse and the attractiveness of creatures of potential friends
