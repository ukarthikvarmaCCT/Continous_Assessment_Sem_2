 '' vishwa hindu parishad ke netaa ashok sighal ne vishwa hindu congress main kuch aisa kaha diya he jis par vivaad hona tay he
 Ashok Singhal said that after 800 years, the command of Delhi has come in the hands of Hindu self-respecters
 bijpi netaa ne kaha- bharat main rahane vaale sabhi log hindu harrshok singhl ne kaha, 'prithviraj chavaan ke baad dilli kii satta hinduon ke paas ai he
 This statement of the VHP leader is being seen by linking the Modi government with the overwhelming majority
 singhl ne jab yah bayaan diya us vakt rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pramukh mohan bhagwat bhi manch par hi maujuud the
 It is worth noting that ever since the BJP came to power at the Center, such statements have been made by Hinduist organizations
 khud sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne bharat ko hindu raashtra bataaya tha
 a political uproar took place on his statement
 yah baat he disambar, 2001 kii, jab taliban ke safaaye ke baad afghanistan ke bhavishya par vichaar karne ke liye bon main ek baithak sampann hui thi
 Returning from Frankfurt Airport, a man walked through the fast steps to the Indian delegation
 yah afghanistan ke nrishastri ashraf gani the, jinhen sanyukt raashtra ke vishesh doot kaa sahyog karne ke liye vahaan bheja gaya tha
 Even though the donors' conference promised Afghanistan millions of dollars of support, Ghani was nervous about this
 unki chintaa bahut buniyadi thi
 Right now only promises have been made, cash is missing, while the transitional government of Afghanistan urgently needed money
 unhone poocha, ''kya bharat shuruaati taur par 1 karod dollar kii madad de saktaa he?” us din gani apni baat samaj paane main kaamyaab rahe the
 India obeyed him and this amount reached Kabul
 gani aaj afghanistan main raashtrapati chunaav jeetne ke muhane par khadey hai
 They are leading by one million votes
 is badhat par vivaad he
 However, India is still apprehensive about the election results
 raashtrapati chunaav kii daud main ek baat bilkul saaf thi ki bharat gani par nahin, abdulla abdulla par apana daanv khel rahaa tha
 It is not that Indian intermediaries' relations with Ghani are not good, but Abdullah's relationship with India overshadows that
 abdulla kaa parivaar barason bharat main rahaa he
 His children have been educated here and they have been an essential part of the old Northern Alliance led by Ahmed Shah Masood
 duusari ore gani pashchim kii paidaaish hai
 He studied at American University and Columbia University in Beirut and later at Berkeley and John Hopkins University before joining the World Bank
 vishwa bank kii pariyojnaon kii nigaraanee karne ke silsile main unhone kuch vakt karnataka main bitaayaa tha
 He is said to have had a keen interest in India's agricultural history and land reforms during that time
 baad main ve afghanistan ke vitt mantri bane or kabul uniwarsity ke chancelar bhi
 Like Abdullah, he too contested the 2009 election and finished fourth
 haal hi main sankramanakalin afghanistan main ve pramukh madhyasth ke rup main charchaa main aae, jiske baad vahaan se nato balon kii vaapasi kaa rasta khulaa
 India's concerns in their context are two-sided
 pehali chintaa janadesh ke khandit hone kii he, jahaan pakhtoon or tajik ke bich khatarnaak dhruvikaran ho rahaa he
 This scenario is perfectly suited to the rise of religious fundamentalism and pro-taliban forces
 duusare, pakistan ko lekar gani kaa najariya pashchimi udaarvaad se prerit he
 They believe that India and Pakistan should resolve their mutual issues in the interest of Afghanistan
 yah apane aap main ek acha vichaar ho saktaa he, lekin kabul ke liye nitigat taur par yah donon deshon se samaan duuri banaae rakhane kaa nuskhaa bhi he
 He has expressed his views in closed-door meetings with Indian officials
 bharat ko dar he ki pakistan ke sandarbh main gani afghanistan kii niti ko or lacheela banaaenge taaki taliban ko niyantran main rakhane ke liye unhen pakistan kaa sahyog mil sake
 The Taliban are spreading terror there under Pakistani protection
 iske badale pakistan chahega ki afghanistan apane yahaan bharat kii maujuudagi or asar ko kam kare
 Since Ghani does not suffer from any anti-india mindset, he will have to take tough decisions on this front
 vastav main nivartmaan raashtrapati hamid karaji kaa rukh pakistan ke saath kuch samay tak samjhautavaadi tha
 But when he realized that Afghan policy was not in the hands of Islamabad, he changed his stand
 abhi haal hi main jab pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne aatankiyon se ladgaye ke liye karaji se sahyog maanga to unhone sahyog ke liye kuch sharten rakhkar pakistan ko chaunkaa diya
 The conditions were as follows: All terrorists would be targeted without discrimination; Afghan Taliban leaders who are supportive of Aman in Afghanistan will be released
 or afghanistan or pakistan ko bharat va china ke saath milakar apane aatankwaad virdohi prayaason ko samanvit karnaa hoga
 If Ghani was elected President, there would be no hope of a letter written to Pakistan in such strong words
 lekin bharat ko is tarah kii kisi bhi sthiti ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 The biggest diplomatic challenge at the moment is that efforts should be made to bridge such a deep political gap
 chunavi prakriya ko lekar kuch sawaal jarur hai, jo aane vaale ekaadh hafte main nipat jaaenge
 But after that there should be peace
 gani ke liye yah baat khaas isliye hogi kyonki ve khud pakhtoon hai or unhen tajikon ko satta main hissedari dene kii disha main pahal kerani he
 Since the Afghan National Army consists mostly of Tajik, there is an option to give a Tajik the post of Defense Minister

 In India, many incidents of violence were exposed due to rumors and fake news through whatsapp
 iske baad fasebuk ke swaamitv vaale watsap ne in ghatnaon par lagaam lagane ke liye kai campan shuru kiya tha
 It is now learned that the government can issue guidelines to whatsapp to put a stop to fake news and inflammatory posts after the Lok Sabha elections
 iske tahat sarkaar miseging ap company se ye poochhegi aisi kisi post kii shuruyaat kahaan se hui
 But whatsapp does not want to tell the government
 company kaa kahana he ki aisa karnaa niztaa or abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 According to the Economic Times news, whatsapp will oppose the government's proposed rules in this regard
 soshal media company ke is kadam kii jaankaree sutron ke hawaale se mili he
 According to the information received, the government can issue guidelines to social media companies after the general elections, according to which if such companies or employees of the app do not tell what the source of the message is, then the company can be fined, as well as employees Jail can also be sent
 watsap se jude ek sutara ke hawaale se ye khabar mili he ki, watsap ko lagata he ki prastaavit niyamon kaa dayera bahut bada he or ye niztaa ke adhikaar ke khilaaf bhi he
 The right to privacy is of great importance to all people around the world
 company ko lagata he ki sarkaar jo maang kar rahi he use puraa karnaa kaaphi mushkil he kyonki company yugers ko and tu and encripshan ofer karti he
 In such a situation, the company will have to work on a completely new product to give information about the source of a post
 ek anya sutara ne ET ko bataaya ki, watsap is maamle main sarkaar kaa virodh jari rakhegi, kyonki use lagata he ki aise niyamon se encripshan feechar kamjor hoga
 The company believes that storing users' personal data does not match the nature of the platform
 watsap kaa nirmaan isliye kiya gaya he taaki yugers ke bich aapasi baatcheet main gopniyata bani rahe
 The music launch program of the film 'ghar Bounty' starring the famous Pakistani Ghazal singer Ghulam Ali has been canceled
 iske liye pehle dilli main yojit hone vaale press conferes ko bhi radd kar diya gaya
 The event was to take place at the Hotel Royal Plaza in Connaught Place
 hindu sena or bajrang dal kaa virongulam ali ke kaarykramake khilaaf hindu sena or bajrang dal ne virodh pradarshan kiya tha
 Ali was about to press conference before the music launch of his film 'ghar Vaasti'
 virodh ke baad hotel management ne kaarykram radd kar diya
 After this Ali is halfway through and Amar Singh has to return back to the hotel doorway
 hotel royal plaza ke prabandhan ne kaha ki ise ‘kaarykram kii koi jaankaree naa die jane’ or saath hi ‘koi kanoonee dastavej’ naa dikhaane ke liye radd kiya gaya
 The organizers had demanded from the police that the director of the film Suhaib Ilyasi, who had organized the program for Gulaam Alike before protection, had lodged a police complaint and requested for his safety
 unhone kaha tha ki hindu sena naam ke sanghathan se gulam ali ko khatra he
 Ilyasi had also sought protection for himself
 eliyasi ne daawa kiya ki unhen hindu sena ke vishnu gupta ne phone kol kar kaarykram ko baadhit karne kii dhamkee di thihiraasat main liye gaye kai pradarshnkariyojan sthal ke baahar pulicekarmiyon ko tainaat kiya gaya or ‘bharat mata kii jai’ kaa naaraa laga rahe kuch logon ko hiraasat main bhi liya gaya
 Some of them said that they are volunteers of the Hindu army
 nirdeshak ab kaarykram ke dobaaraa aayojan kii yojana bana rahe hai lekin iskaa aayojan sthal abhi tay nahin kiya gaya he
 Ilyasi said - will organize again Iliasi said that we will definitely organize again
 mujhe pataa tha ki is tarah kii ghatana ho sakati he, isliye maine dilli police or grih mantralay ko patr likhakar suraksha muhaiyaa karaane ke liye kaha
 i am glad that the Government of India and the police did everything possible on their behalf
 iske baavjood hotel ne aayojan radd karne kaa faisla kiya
 The program was canceled in Mumbai due to Shiv Sena
 Iliasi had earlier organized Ghulam Ali program in Mumbai, but the program had to be shifted from Mumbai to Delhi after Shiv Sena protests
 us dauraan dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne gulam ali ko dilli main kaarykram karne kaa bulaava bheja tha

 Union Minister Ananth Kumar Hegde gave a clarification on Thursday in the Lok Sabha this morning after increasing opposition to the controversial statement regarding the constitution

 His colleague and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav had said a day before that the Chief Minister of Bihar and his ally Nitish Kumar had supported the candidate for the post of NDA President
 ab shuukravaar ko lalu prasad ne kaha he ki pataa nahin kya khichdi paki ki nitish aresas kii raah chal die
 He has said that he will meet Nitish Kumar during Iftar party and talk to him on this issue
 tippaniyan Lalu said, 'I also attended two meetings, i had also gone to one meeting and i had also gone
 maine nitish kumaar ji se poocha tha ki kya karnaa he, kya nirnay he? to nitish ji ne kaha tha ki jo sabhi log kahenge usko maananaa he, vipaksh ko ek saath chalanaa he
 Now suddenly, what did Khichdi say that Nitishji's party JDU named BJP candidate and took the name of candidate of RSS
 jarur nitish ji se baat karenge or apil karenge ki is par phir se vichaar kii, aitihaasik galati to aapse ho gai he
 ' guuruuvaar ko lalu ne kaha tha, 'unke sahyogi jadyu dwaara endie ke raashtrapati pad ke pratyaashee ramnath kovind kaa samarthan karne kaa nirnay 'ek galat nirnay' he or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar unka samarthan kar 'aitihaasik bhul' kar rahe hai
 ' rajd bihar main nitish kumaar ke jad you or congress ke saath gathbandhan sarkaar main shaamil he
 The RJD supremo had said that he would ask Nitish Kumar to reconsider the case but there was no threat to the state government and the alliance would continue despite the JD-U decision
 lalu ne kaha tha ki ki main unase aitihaasik galati nahin karne ke liye kahuunga kyonki bhaajapa ummidavaar ko samarthan karne kaa unka nirnay galat he
 ' lalu ne kaha, 'do do baithak main shariq bhi hue, main bhi gaya tha ek baithak main to main bhi gaya tha
 i asked Nitish Kumar, what to do, what is the decision? So Nitish ji had said that all those who will say, believe him, the opposition has to go together
 ab ekaek kya khichdi paki ki nitish ji kii party jediu ne naam bol diya bijepi ke ummidavaar kaa, aresas ke ummidavaar kaa naam le liya
 Surely we will talk to Nitish ji and appeal that to reconsider it, a historical mistake has been made from you
 ' On Thursday, Lalu had said, "the decision by his ally JDU to support NDA presidential candidate Ramnath Kovind is a" wrong decision "and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is making a 'historic mistake' by supporting him
 ' The RJD is in a coalition government in Bihar with Nitish Kumar's JD u and the Congress
 rajd supremeo ne kaha tha ki vah nitish kumaar se maamle main punavarchir karne ke liye kahenge lekin isse rajya sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he or jad you ke is nirnay ke baavjood gathbandhan jari rahegaa
 Lalu had said that i would ask him not to make a historical mistake as his decision to support the BJP candidate is wrong
 ' The RJD is in a coalition government in Bihar with Nitish Kumar's JD u and the Congress

 nehru par die bayaan par kaayam shivarajchauhan urisa main desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ko lekar die gaye bayaan par abhi bhi kaayam hai
 He said that everything he said about Jawaharlal Nehru was not wrong
 shivaraj ne kaha ki desh ke sabhi mahapurushon kaa sammaan karata hum, lekin mere liye raashtra sarvopari he
 He who commits a crime with the nation is the biggest criminal
 jo kaha tha vah tathyon ke aadhaar par kaha tha, congress ke log is baat kaa jawaab den
 Chauhan said that Kashmir was a part of India like other states, but why did he love Sheikh Abdullah so much? Sheikh Abdullah demanded a special state
 doctor ambedkar ne manaa kiya, lekin nehru ji ne baat nahin suni
 Due to special love for Sheikh Abdullah, Article 370 was imposed in Kashmir, so i believe that it was a crime to implement Section 370
 unhone kaha ki ghati khun se rangati rahi
 Sheikh Abdullah's family flourished
 kashmir ko mukhya dhara se alag kiya gaya
 bjp's national vice president did not stop here
 unhone kaha ki ek or aparaadh kiya panditji ne, jab bhartiya fouj pakistaniyon ko lahore main khaded rahi thi to yuddh viraam kar diya gaya
 Internal matters became international matters

 sajjanar cybrabad ke police ayukta hai or ye sanyog hi he ki 2008 main jab ve warangal main tainaat the to vahaan ejineering kii chaatra se ekatarfa pyaar main tejaab phenkane kii ghatana main giraftaar teen aropiyon ne ghatana ke ricriation ke dauraan police ke hathiyaar chhinane kaa prayaas kiya tha lekin police ne teenon ko maar giraaya
 Now on 6 December, the accused of raping a Veterinary Doctor in Hyderabad also tried to execute the same incident during the incident, but they were killed by the sharp policemen of Sajjanar, who are being praised all over the country
 
 khushiyaan manaai ja rahi hai
 From common man and women to mps and veteran leaders are praising the police
 ye tarif acchhee he lekin is tarif main ek ninda chhipi he nyaayik system kii jisamen police, nyaaypalika or raajnneeti teenon kii hissedari he
 Our system has failed, so in this way people celebrate in the encounter of the dreaded criminals
 na ye encounter nae hai or na hi ye khushiyaan nai hai
 British era police also used to carry out such operations against criminals
 aazaadee ke baad khaastaur par sakriy hue chambal ke daakuon kaa encounter bhi tab logon ko raahat dilaataa tha
 It is another matter that the bandits used to get patronage of the politicians there
 ye sab baaten filmon main bhi dikhaai ja chuki hai
 Actually, there is a provision in democracy to listen to everyone's voice and many people take advantage of it
 hamaare desh main bhi aise netaaon-afasaron yani taqatvar logon kii kami nahin he jo khud ko kanoon se bachaane ke liye vyavastha kii khaamiyon kaa phayda uthaate hai
 Gurmeet Ram Rahim and Asaram also stayed out of the prison bars for a long time, but the treatment that this system is doing with people like these is creating deep anger among the common people
 isi vajah se hyderabad encounter jaisi ghatnaon par log khushi jataa rahe hai
 These people are celebrating an event which is heavy on a rotten system, which is a matter of concern for the future of that system
 ham saal 1860 main bani ipisi kii jagah kanoon kii kitaab nahin bana sake to isaki vajah bhi hamaare tantra main chhipi hui he
 The British made laws to rule which was in their favor and not in favor of the people

 nirbhay missile kaaphi nichi oonchai par udne main sakshan he, jisase yah dushman ke radar se chhipakar uske thikaanon ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 It has a very high-level navigation system for accurate aiming of the missile
 raksha vaigyanikon ko ummid he ki yah missile brahmos kii kami ko puraa karti he, kyonki uski maarak seemaa 290 kilometre he, jabaki yah 1000 kilometre tak maar sakati he
 Scientists got the fifth success in the test of Ismail

 You could be surprised to see the medal table how the United States won 25 disciplines and how Britain managed to finish second behind China by a slight margin
 yaa aap bharat ke ab tak ke sabase bade jatthe ke pradarshan par ankhen gadaaye rakh sakate the or is baat par tesue baha sakate the ki kis tarah ek or olympic khel keval do maukon ko chhodkar bharat kaa raashtragan bajaae or tirangaa fahraae bagaiyr biit gaya
 You could also keep an eye on the Olympics in all these ways simultaneously and avoid the superficial analysis that forces Indian sportspersons to beat their chests on lost occasions one after the other
 america, britain or china ke lagaataar badhate kad ke saamne, felps or bolt kii chaaya main bhartiya athleton ne jo hasil kiya, vah behad maamuli dikhaai detaa he
 No matter how important it is to win medals in the Games, the Olympics have always meant a new definition of 'winner'
 iskaa matlab uplabdhi or kamyaabi ko hameshaa tulanaatmak taur par maapna rahaa he—khud se tulana, apane maahaul se tulana, aap jahaan se aae hai or aapane pehle jo kiya he, usase tulana
 The meticulous study of India's performance in Rio reveals a number of extraordinary events that raise hope even in our 67th-ranked disappointment in the medals table
 bharat ke olympic safar main rio main aisa pehali baar hua jab keval hamaare athleton ko dekhne waalon ke liye bhi roj kuch na kuch na tha
 Two shooters reached the final of their respective events, and Beijing Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra missed the bronze medal by a distance of one millionth of a meter or one thousandth of a millimeter

 kuch logon ko lag saktaa he ki yah noummidi main ummid khojane kii tarah he, ki ham tinakon kaa sahaara khoj rahe hai
 But if the games mean how you play, then you can say that most of the players were the ones who played the game
 iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki maayusiyaan nahin thim
 We had high expectations from archers, boxers and wrestlers, in which it has become our tradition to win medals on international forums
 magar choton, kade muqablon or tanaav ke maukon par ummid se kamatar pradarshnon kii vajah se in teen khelon main bharat mahaj ek kaansya padak hasil kar sakaa—josho-kharosh se bhari sakshi malik kaa padak
 No one can feel the pain more than the athletes who have spent their lives for the last four years preparing for this moment, without any support for that disparate, economical system that they have with others It behaves like class citizens

 Instead it is left to the Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ), a non-profit organization, to take all the blame on its head and vow to find answers within itself
 ojiku pichley ek dashak se kuleen athleton kii madad ke liye kaam kar rahaa he or bharat ke liye jite gaye pichley aath padakon main se paanch main iskaa yogadan rahaa he
 In a tweet on August 21, OGQ congratulated the athletes, saying, "we feel that our efforts to help the athletes were not enough and we need to look deep within ourselves
" 
 
 ham feedback or rachanaatmak aalochana ke liye bilkul khule hai
 "india may be far away from becoming a real sports nation, but it is also expected that Indian sports have finally begun to express themselves
" hamaare athlete khud apane kandhon par bidaa uthaa rahe hai or khud se oonchi ummiden kar rahe hai
 They are not happy just playing in the Olympics, they want to become champions

 is pahari ko aaj bhi kodhya duungri ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Villagers believe that bathing under the waterfall made on this hill during rainy cures many diseases because there are many types of metals in this hill
 varshon pehle bane chabutare ke aaj bhi mandir main tabdeel na hone ke peeche gaanv ke upasarpanch ganesh meena daleel dete hai, ''kyonki manyata he ki yahaan nirmaan kaary puraa hone se baval ke dhani naaraaz ho jaaenge or gaanv mahamari kii chapet main aa jayega
 At first, the villagers tried to put stones in the house, then the disease spread from house to house throughout the village

 It was here that Maharaja's mare Revathi died
 '' gaanv main jarurat padane par log dur sthit pahari se hi pathar laate hai
 Anyway, after the wishes are fulfilled today, the women of Tamdoli and surrounding villages offer Padukas with great faith
 vahiin pradesh ke dakshini jile duungarpur shahar se 6 kilometre dur sthit lakshmanpura gaanv main kuch aise hi dev or pujaarey he
 Here people come and offer five stones on Parya Dev
 phir apni manokamana puri hone kii arji lagaate hai
 Once the wish is fulfilled, once again come to pray
 lakshmanpura sahit aasapaas ke kai gaanvon ke logon kii is sthaan se gahari aasthaa judi he
 The antiquity of the place and the faith of the people associated with it reached not only in the state but also in Gujarat
 yahaan parya dev ke prakat hone kii daastaan bhi kaaphi rochak he
 Talking about the villagers, about 300 years ago, the recognized person of the village, Mogaji Bhai, had gone to the police station village to take a cauldron for making jaggery in return for his dues
 vahaan unako na to rakam mili or na kadaha
 While being hungry and thirsty for three days, when Mogaji Bhai was returning from there, he died near Laxmanpura village
 us vakt mrityu ke samachar kaise mili?gaanv ke ek vyakti ko wo sapane main aae or apni laash lakshmanpura main padi hone kii baat kahi
 Also said that at the place where i died, if a person comes there and will offer five stones, then his wish will be fulfilled
 agle din subah jab gaanv vaale bhagkar lakshmanpura gaye to vahaan mogajibhai kii laash mili
 Today a small temple is built at that place, behind which a mountain of stones offered by people is formed
 dher zyada hone par samay samay par gaanv vaale inako hataate bhi hai
 Keshubhai says, "for five generations we have been offering stones to Parya Dev
 '' yuva mayank joshi kii maane to yuvaaon kaa bhi is sthaan se kaaphi judaav he
 "it is a simple matter, if the desire is fulfilled, then why won't anyone come?" Here, in the middle of jodhpur-pali in Marwar, near the Rohit Police Station, Omji also draws hundreds of people to his side every day
 yahaan ek ped ke neeche rakhi bullate motorcycle par log dhaagaa or prasad chadhaane aate hai
 This place has become so famous that offerings, toys and breakfast-water shops are decorated here
 jodhpur-paali mukhya rajmarg par hone se har koi darshan karne aasaani se aa jaataa he
 The story of this place is also interesting
 logon kii maane to ek durghatana main motorcycle savaar om bana kii mrityu ho gai
 The police took the motorcycle to a nearby police station
 bataate hai, raat ke vakt vah swatah durghatanasthal par aa gai
 This happened many times
 tab police or gaanv ke logon ne milakar motorcycle ko ek ped ke neeche khadaa kar diya jo aaj ek aasthaa kaa centre ban chukaa he
 People from far-flung areas of the state also come here
 yahaan aane vaali bheed dekhakar lagata he ki unke dukh-dard dur hote hi honge
 It is necessary to add one thing here that people do not blindly trust public beliefs
