ye plig jaisi bimariyon kaa ilaaj karte the
 In his poems, he had described the future events
 adhikansh shaikshanik or vaigyanik sutron kaa kahana he ki duniya kii ghatnaon or nastredamas ke shabdon ke bich dikhaae gaye sambandh kaaphi had tak galat vyakhyaaon yaa galat anuwaad kaa parinaam he yaa phir itane kamjor hai ki unhen vaastavik bhavishya bataane kii shakti ke sakshya ke rup main prastut karnaa bekaar he
 Some misinterpretations or incorrect translations have also been made intentionally
 is ke baavjood he bhi, beesvin shatabdi main nastredamas kii kathith bhavishyavaaniyan aam logon ke bich bahut lokapriy ho gayi or kai pramukh vishwa ghatnaon kii bhavishyavaanee kaa shrey unhen diya gaya
 Nostradamus, famous for announcing the future thousands of years ago, was born on 14 December 1503 in Saint Remy, a small village in France
 unka naam mishael di nastredamas tha bachapan se hi unki adhyayan main khaas dilchaspee rahi or unhonen latin, unani or hebru bhashaaon ke alaava ganit, sharir vigyaan evam jyotish shaastra jaise good vishyon par vishesh maharath hasil kar lee
 Nostradamus started making predictions from adolescence
 jyotish main unki babbti dilchaspee ne mata-pita ko chintaa main daal diya kyonki us samay kattarpanthi isai is vidya ko acchhee najar se nahin dekhte the
 To divert his attention from astrology, he was sent to Mont Pelier to study medical science, after which he completed three years of study and became a doctor of Nostradamus
 23 oktober 1529 ko unhone maant polier se hi doctoret kii oopaadhi lee or usee vishvavidhyalay main shikshak ban gaye
 After the death of his first wife, he went to Europe in 1547 and married Ann second
 is dauraan unhonen bhavishyavaktaa ke rup main khaas naam kamaaya
 According to a legend, once Nostredamus was walking on the streets of Italy with his friend, he saw a young man in the crowd and when he came near the youth greeted him with respect
 mitra ne aashcharyachakit hote hue iskaa kaaran puchha to unhone kaha ki yah vyakti aage jaakar pope kaa asana grahan karegaa
 According to legend, the person was actually Felis Peretti who was elected Pope in 1585
 nastredamas ke bare main aisi kai kahaniyaan hai, lekin inamen se kisi ke liye koi saboot nahin he
 Hearing the fame of the prophecies of Nostradamus, Queen Catherine of France expressed her desire to know the future of her children
 nastredamas apni ichha se yah jaan chuke the ki maharani ke dono bachche alpaayu main hi puure ho jaaenge, lekin sach kehane kii himmat nahin ho paayi or unhone apni baat ko pratikatmak chhandon main pesh kiya
 In this way, he also said his words and there was no injury to the Queen's mind
 tabhi se nastredamas ne yah tay kar liya ki ve apni bhavishyavaaneeyan ko isi tarah chando main hi vyakt karengen
 After 1550, Nostredamus left the profession of doctor and concentrated his attention on the practice of astrology
 usee saal se anhone apana vaarshik panchag bhi nikaalnaa shuru kar diya
 There were forecasts about planetary positions, weather and crops etc
 kaha jaataa he ki unamem se zyaadaatar satya sabit hui
 Along with astrology, Nostradamus spent hours immersed in books related to magic
 nastredamas ne 1555 main bhavishyavaaniyon se sambandhit apane pehle granth centuri ke pratham bhaag kaa lekhan puraa kiya, jo sabase pehle french or baad main angreji, german, italvi, roman, greek bhashaaon main prakashit hua
 This book created such a panic in France that it sold hands and hands despite being expensive at that time
 unke kuch vyakhyakaaron k maananaa he ki is kitaab ke kai chando main pratham vishwa yuddh, nepolian, hitler or kennedy aadi se sambanddh ghatnaayen spasht rup se dekhi ja sakati hai
 Interpreters claim to have succeeded in understanding the prognosis of the Third World War and the signs of the destruction of the world in several verses of Nostradamus
 adhikansh shaikshanik or vaigyanik sutron kaa kahana he ki ye vyakhyaayein galat anuwaad yaa galatarahami kaa parinaam hai or kuch galtiyaan to jaanboojhkar bhi kii gayi hai
 The last years of Nostradamus's life went through a lot of suffering
 france kaa nyaay vibhaag unke viruddh yah jaanch kar rahaa tha ki kya vah vaastaav main jaadu-tone kaa sahaara lete the
 Had this charge been proved, they would have been entitled to punishment
 lekin jaanch kaa nishkarsh yah niklaa ki ve koi jaadugar nahin balki jyotish vidya main paarangat he
 In those days, i was suffering from ascites
 sharir main ek phoda ho gaya jo lakh upachar ke baad bhi thik nahin ho paaya
 He had foreseen his death, so he got his will ready on 17 June 1566
 ek july ko padri ko bulaakar apane antim sanskaar ke nirdesh die
 On 2 July 1566 this famous prophet died
 kaha jaataa he ki apni mrityu kii tithi or samay kii bhavishyavaanee ve pehle hi kar chuke the
 According to one interpretation "one of the few predictions made by Nostradamus in his relation was that 225 years after his death, some anti-social elements would dig his grave and try to remove his remains but immediately his Will die vastav me aisi hi hua
 After the French Revolution, in 1791, three people dug the tomb of Nostredamus, who died instantly

 Since not much material of that period has been preserved, little is known about the Hedian period, but scientists estimate that at about 4

 Gradually as the cloud increased its rotation speed, due to gravity and inactivity, it transformed into a micro-planetary wheel, which was perpendicular to its axis of rotation

 According to the widely accepted nebula concept, the process by which the planets of the Solar System arose, the same process produces growth circles around all the new stars that form in the universe, some of which are stars from the planets

 During the accumulation of material on the primitive planet, a cloud of gaseous silica must have surrounded the Earth, which later condensed into its surface as solid rocks

 When the current radius of the Earth increased by about 40%, it changed and gravity held the atmosphere, including water

 During the Apollo program, rock fragments were brought from the lunar surface to Earth

 Also said, it must have been slightly smaller in size than the current Mars
 sambhav he ki uskaa nirmaan surya va prithvi se 150 million kilometre dur, unke chauthe yaa paanchave lagrengian bindu par padaarth ke sanchayan ke dwaara hua ho
 Initially her orbit would have been stable, but when Theia's weight started increasing due to the accumulation of matter, she would have become unbalanced
 lagrengian bindu ke chaaron ore theia kii ghurnan-kaksha badhati gai or antat lagbhag 4
533 Ga main vah prithvi se takaraa gaya
 The models show that when a colliding planet of this size collided with ancient Earth at a low angle and at a relatively slow rate, most of the material emanating from the inner layer and outer cover of the primitive-earth and dominant planet bounced into space, where Most of it remained in orbit around the Earth
 antat isi padaarth ne chandramaa kii rachana kii
 However, the metallic-like elements of the planetary planet combined with the Earth's element went below its surface, leaving the Moon deprived of metal-like elements

 It is possible that the material emitted in orbit around the earth has become condensed as a body within two weeks
 apane swayan ke gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav main, yah utsarjit padaarth ek adhik vrittakar pind main badal gaya: chandramaa
 Radiometric calculations show that Earth existed at least 10 million years before this impact, which is a sufficient period for the differentiation between the Earth's initial mantle and the inner layer

 It is also believed that due to this impact the Earth's axis also changed and it produced an axial tilt of 23

 It would have also increased the speed of the Earth's rotation

 Since the sun's production was only 70% of the current volume, it is most likely that large amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prevented the surface water from freezing
 The free oxygen must have been bound to the surface with hydrogen or minerals

 Casing convection, the process governing current plate tectonics, is the result of heat flow from the center to the Earth's surface

 The alternation between the greenstone belts and the ttg-mixtures is interpreted as a tectonic situation, in which the small archaic continents were separated by an entire network of subducting zones

 There are two theories about the origin of life
 ek yah suzav detii he ki jaivik ghatak antariksh se prithvi par aae, jabaki duusari kaa tark he ki unki utpatti prithvi par hi hui
 Despite this, both theories suggest a similar approach to how life originally originated
 yadi jivan kii utpatti prithvi par hui thi, to is ghatana kaa samay atyadhik kalpana aadhaarit he-sambhawatah isaki utpatti 4 Ga ke lagbhag hui
 It is possible that life may have arisen and destroyed more than once due to the continuous formation and destruction of the oceans during the same period by the bombardment of high-energy asteroids

 When the choice of raw materials was exhausted, the breeds could use different substances, or possibly stunt their resources and become more widespread, preventing the development of other breeds

 One of the older theories, the theory that has been worked on in some detail, will serve as an example of how this would have happened

 In any case, at some point DNA took over the task of replicator; All known organisms use DNA as their replicator in a nearly identical manner
 aadhunik jivan kaa pratilipikaarak padaarth ek koshikeey jhilli ke bheetar rakhaa hota he
 It is easier to understand the origin of the cellular membrane than the origin of the replicator because a cellular membrane is composed of phospholipid molecules, which when placed in water, often immediately form two layers

:40 The prevailing theory is that the membrane was formed after the replicator, which by then was probably RNA with its replicating material and other biological molecules
 The initial protocell would probably have exploded if it had grown too much; The dispersed material may have reassembled as "bubbles"
 protein, jo ki jhilli ko sthirataa pradaan karte the, yaa jo baad main saamaanya vibhaajan main sahaayta karte the, ne un koshika rekhaon ke prasaran ko protsaahit kiya hoga
 RNA can be an early replicator because it can perform both the task of storing genetic information and catalyzing reactions

 The glacial deposits found on all cratons indicate that around 2

 According to some scientists, this and subsequent Proterozoic ice ages were so severe that the planet was completely frozen from the poles to the equinoxes, a concept called Snowball Earth

 Being an inseparable part of the Indian Union, it is not appropriate to separate Kerala's economic system from the national economic system
 phir bhi kerala kii aarthik vyavastha kii apni visheshtaayen hai
 The achievements of Kerala are commendable as per the basic information of human resource development
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas ke buniyadi tattvon main ullekhneey hai - bharat ke anya rajyon kii tulana main aabaadi kii kam vruddhi dar, rashtriya ausat saghanta se unchi dar, unchi aayu-dar, gambhir swasthya chetana, kam shishu mrityu dar, unchi sakshartaa, praathmik shiksha kii saarvajaniktaa, ucch shiksha kii suvidha aadi aarthik pragati ke anukool hai
 But due to slowdown in production sector, high unemployment rate, rising market prices, low per capita income, impact of consumer litigation etc
, the economy of Kerala is getting complicated
 lambi aayu dar ke maamle main kerala kii tulana dakshin korea, malaysia, china aadi se kii ja sakati he
 But all three are different from Kerala and are on the path of economic development
 yadhyapi maanav sansaadhan vikaas ke suchakon ke anusaar kerala bhartiya rajyon main agrani he
 In the past, Kerala's per capita income rate was below the national income rate
 jabaki kerala kii aarthik vyavastha vikaas kaa gun prakat karti he
 The economic growth of Kerala in the late eighties has surpassed the average national economic growth rate
 yah vikaas abhi bhi jari he
 But this alone does not make the state strong
 vaishvikaran ke pratikul prabhaav ne krishi tathaa anya paramparaagat kshetron kaa khaatmaa kar diya he
 Development has not been done in these areas for the last six-seven years
 lekin ab is sthiti main badlaav aana shuru hua he jo shubhasuchak he
 Kerala has to achieve economic development which is just, permanent and immediate
 saath hi vikaas ke kshetra main jo niti apanaai gayi he usamen sarkari hastkshep kam karne yaa saamaajik kalyaan ke vyay kam karne kaa koi prayaas nahin dikhaai detaa
 Development of pre-independence Thiruvittankur, Kochi, Malabar regions is the backdrop of modern Kerala's economic system
 bhugolic evam prakritik visheshtaayen kerala kii aarthik vyavastha ko prakritik sampada ke vaividhya ke saath shram sambandhi vaividhya bhi pradaan karti hai
 Kerala is divided into three major geographical regions
 tateey kshetra sarvaadhik saghan aabaadi vaala kshetra he
 Its fertile soil, riverine area, lakes etc
 are suitable for fish production, rice, coconut and greens
 parvatiy evam samudr tateey kshetron ke bich ke pradeshon main nariyal, chaaval, tapyoka, supaari ke ped, kaashew ke ped, rabad, kalimirch, adarak aadi kii kheti hoti he
 The cultivation of coffee, tea, rubber in the Eastern Pahari region has been going on since colonial times
 20 veen sadi ke madhya main purvi pahari kshetra main jansanchaar evam sthaapan hua isse kerala kii aarthik vyavastha viksit hui
 Agriculture in Kerala is suitable for food grains and export crops
 shashan vyavastha tathaa vyapaar ke kaaran niryaat kii janevaali fasalon badhotari hui he
 Coir industry, wood industry, edible oil production etc
 are also based on agriculture
 isi ke saath hi dhaatuen, rasayan vastuen, ejineering aadi ko aadhaar banane vaale bade-bade udyog bhi vikaas karne lage hai
 Public and private establishments are working in these areas
 kayar utpaadan, kaarigari, handloom aadi kerala ke paramparaagat vyavsaay he
 Nevertheless, it is not fair to say that Kerala's economic system is based solely on agriculture
 kerala ke aarthik vikaas kaa ullekhneey pahalu na to praathmik kshetra maane janevaala krishi udyog he or na hi vibhinn utpaadan-nirmaan se yukt udyog kshetra he
 The main aspect of economic development is the third sector called the service sector
 keraly aamadani tathaa rojgaar kaa adhikansh bhaag yaheen se praapt hota he
 Kerala is moving ahead of the other states of India in almost all the regions, generally any state can reach the high foot of economic development only by crossing the first, second and third regions
 is aarthik siddhant ke viruddh pratham kshetra evam dwitiya kshetra ko chod tritiy kshetra main pahunchakar kerala mrityu dar, sakshartaa aurat aayu aadi main viksit deshon ke samaksh sthaan grahan kar saktaa he
 How Kerala could achieve this status by making low capital per capita income and high unemployment remains an unanswered question
 bharat kaa koi bhi doosraa rajya is prakaar duniya kaa dhyaan aakrisht nahin kar sakaa
 Not only in the economic sector, but also in the political, social and cultural fields, the development that has taken place in Kerala is being discussed in developed countries
 1980 ke ant main kerala kii aarthik vyavastha ne jo unnati kii uski Kerala Model naam se videshon main bhi charchaa hui
 Many questions are raised today regarding this example
 uske sthayitv par kai arthshaastri andeh prakat karte hai
 Since the 19th century, the government has adopted a social welfare policy and under its implementation the government has been spending for basic amenities is the main source of social development of Kerala

 As mentioned earlier, the economic system of Kerala is developing from agricultural culture to service culture
 bharat kii krishi pradhan aarthik vyavastha main kerala kaa pramukh sthaan he
 The elements that determine the agricultural life of Kerala are: - The specific natural area, the variety of soils and the climate
 kerala kii pramukh fasalein hai - chaaval, nariyal, daal kii vibhinn kismein, rabad, supaari, ilaychi, coffee, chaay, kaashew, tapyoka, kalimirch, adarak, haldi, cocao, laung, jaifal aadi
 North Indian crops like potato, onion etc
 are also grown here
 rabad, coffee, ilaychi, chaay aadi farm fasalein maani jaati hai
 The second type of crops are mainly with the farming families who are adopting agriculture as a livelihood
 kerala kaa krishi kshetra anek sankaton kaa saamana kar rahaa he jinamein chaaval tathaa nariyal donon ke utpaadan kshetra main ghor sankat hai
 Today, Kerala has to depend on other states for rice and vegetables
 yahi nahin krishi bhoomi kaa vistaar bhi ghat gaya he
 The period of soil-filling in agricultural land is going on, which is pushing Kerala towards serious crisis
 yadhyapi kheton main mitti daalkar unhen nariyal ke bageeche banaaya gaya he phir bhi nariyal ke utpaadan main vruddhi nahin hui he
 The production of coconut in 1992 - 1993 was 5843 per hectare which in 2000 increased to 5638 hectares
 rin bhaar, fasalon kaa vinaash, daam giravat ke kaaran krishakon kaa jivan kathin ban gaya he
 Therefore, the government is trying to revive agriculture by setting up agricultural packages and credit assurance commission etc
 kerala kii krishi kaa itihaas naveen prastar yug se prarambh hota he
 Primitive agricultural practices like Punam Krishi were prevalent in ancient times
 adivaasiyon ke paas unki nijee krishi reetiyaan thim
 Ancient agricultural culture was an integral part of the various tools of agriculture, native seeds, methods of conservation of seeds, agricultural period, different types of agricultural lands and agricultural customs, agricultural rituals, agricultural festivals, agricultural songs etc
 kerala ke paas krishi se sambandhit deshi gyaan kaa bada bhandar he
 Kerala has special agricultural areas, such as Kuttanad, Palakkad, Kantallur, Nelliyampati etc
 krishi kshetra main duusare ullekhneey tatv hai - choti-bady jal-sinchan yojanaayen, jalaashyon ke vikaas kii yojanaayen aadi
 Fisheries and animal husbandry are also the main tasks of the agriculture sector
 naveen prastar yug main manushya krishi tathaa pashu paalan kii ore agrasar hua tha
 In those days, humans had two types of weapons - stone-made furs and tree sticks made of sticks
 kerala main bhi naveen prastar yugin krishi rahi hogi, kyonki sahyadri ke kuch kshetron se tej dhar vaale prastar - farse praapt hue hai
 The stones which were received from the banks of Tirunelli and Bavalippusha in Wayanad and from a place called Putatti are of this stone age
 pashupaalan tathaa pahad kii taraaiyon ke jhaad-jhankhad kaat-chhant kar kheti karnaa naveen prastar yugin krishakon kii jivan style thim

 Sangamam literary works, which are considered to be of great stone age, give a detailed presentation of the production process
 sanghamakaleen rachanaayen utpaadan prakriya se judy hai jo vibhinn jan-jatiyon kaa vivaran bhi detii hai
 In those days people who made agriculture a livelihood were called Vellalars
 kerala main vellalar ko vishisht jati vibhaag ke rup main nahin mana jaataa he
 Here the farmers have not been considered as belonging to any particular caste
 baad main waiter or ir varg ke log bhi krishi karm karne lage
 Seeing the fertility of the river banks, the waiters, Ayer, Kurwar etc
 settled there
 ve log kaalaantar main halwale or pulyar kahalaane lage
 The word 'pulam' means land
 krishi pradesh ko 'menpulam' tathaa uske chaaron ore ke pahari pradesh jahaan krishi nahin kii jaati, 'vanpulam' kehete the
 'mainpulum' signified the development of primitive agriculture
 yadhyapi sangham sahitya krishi kaa vistrut varnan prastut karata he tathaapi inamen utpaadan ke parinaam kaa koi ullekh nahin he
 It is also not clear whether agriculture of that period could sustain a large population
 sanghamakaleen paanch 'tinkal' roopi bhoomi ke vibhaajan kii pariklpana bhi pracheen krishak - jivan kaa chitra prastut karti he
 The next phase of the history of agriculture is after the arrival of people of Buddhist, Jain, Brahmin etc
 religion to Kerala
 buddha dharm krishi kii prerana detaa tha
 When the Brahmins settled on the river bank, they took possession of agriculture
 kheton kaa bada hissaa brahmanon ke graamon main aa gaya
 The reason for the Brahmins gaining dominance over farming was their astrological knowledge, on the basis of which they formulated a plan of agriculture and kept control of it
 mandiron kii sthapana ke dwaara unhone zamin par apana aadhipaty jamaaya
 In this way, they gained control of agricultural production even without doing agriculture directly
 is se utpaadan vyavastha main bhi parivartan aayaa
 The people called Ushwar, people of the general department, were divided into several subdivisions
 karalar, kutical, atiyaar pramukh up vibhaag ban gaye
 The major cultivators came to be known as Kaler

 Those living in the fields were called Kutima or Kutianma

 It is also known as the Second War of Kashmir
 bharat or pakistan ke bich jammu or kashmir rajya par adhikaar ke liye bantwaare ke samay se hi vivaad chal rahaa he
 In 1947, the first war between India and Pakistan was also fought for Kashmir
 is ladaai kii shuruuaat pakistan ne apane sainikon ko ghuspaithiyon ke rup main bhej kar is ummid main kii thi ki kashmir kii janata bharat ke khilaaf vidroh kar degi
 This campaign was named by Pakistan as Warbhian Gibraltar
 paanch maheene tak chalane vaale is yuddh main donon pakshon ke hajaaron log maare gayi
 The war ended with the United Nations declaring a ceasefire and an agreement on both sides in Tashkent
 is ladaai kaa adhikansh hissaa donon pakshon kii thal sena ne ladaa
 Before the Kargil War, there was never such a large military gathering in Kashmir
 yuddh main paidal or bakhtarband tukadiyon ne vayusena kii madad se anek abhiyaanon main hissaa liya
 Like many wars between the two sides, both sides did not reveal many details of this war
 bharat or pakistan ke 1947 main hue batwaare ke samay se hi bharat or pakistan ke bich kai muddo par tanatani chal rahi thi haalanki jammu or kashmir kaa mudda isame sabase bada tha par anya seemaa vivaad bhi the iname sabase pramukh kuccha kaa ran, jo ki ek banjar ilaaka he, ke batwaare par tha
 On 20 March 1965, Pakistan deliberately started skirmishes in the Rann of Kutch
 shuru main iname keval seemaa suraksha bal hi shaamil the par baad main dono deshon kii sena bhi yuddh main shaamil ho gayi 1 june 1965 main british pradhanmantri herold wilson ne dono paksho ke bich ladaai rukvaa kar is vivaad ko hal karne ke liye ek nishpaksh madhyasth nyaayalay kii sthapana kar di
 This court gave about 900 square kilometers of the Kutch run to Pakistan
 haalanki pakistan kaa daawa 3500 varg kilometre par tha
 
 kuccha ke ran main mili safalataa se utsahit pakistan ke rajanetaaon khaskar tatkaaleen videshmantri zulfikar ali bhutto ne rashtrpati or senadhyaksh general ayub khan par dabaav daalaa ki ve kashmir par hamale kaa aadesh de
 India had lost the war with China at that time and they believed that India was not in a position to wage war at that time
 iske alaava bhutto or unke vichaar se sahamat anya generalo yahya khan or tikka khan kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki kashmir kii janata bharat se aaazaad hokar pakistan se vilay kii icchhuk he or sainiko ko ghuspaithiyon ke vesh main bhejne par unke samarthan main vidroh kar degi
 At last General Ayub Khan came under pressure and ordered the covert operation of Operation Gibraltar
 is abhiyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy kashmir kii janata main vidroh bhadakaana or bhartiya sanchartantr evam parivahan vyavastha ko nuksaan pahuchana tha
 The infiltrators of Pakistan were quickly identified and instead of rebelling, the public informed the Indian soldiers and the operation completely failed
 5 agast 1965 ko 26000 se 3 xxrep 4 0 ke bich pakistani sainikon ne kashmir kii sthaneey aabaadi kii veshbhusha main niyantran rekha ko paar kar bhartiya kashmir main pravesh kar liya
 The Indian Army, after receiving information from the local population, crossed the Line of Control on 15 August
 
 In the beginning, the Indian Army had good success
 usne topakhane kii madad se teen mahatvapurn pahari thikaano par kabja jamaa liya
 Pakistan made significant progress in the Tithwal, Uri and Poonch regions, but on August 18, the strength of the Pakistani campaign had decreased significantly
 bhartiya atirikt tukadiya laane main safal ho gayi or bharat ne pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir main 8 kilometre andar ghus kar haji pir darre par kabja kar liya
 With this occupation Pakistan came into being
 abhiyaan jibraltar ke ghuspaithiye sanikon kaa rasta bharatiyon ke kabje main aa gaya tha or abhiyaan vifal ho gaya
 Not only this, Pakistan's command felt that Muzaffarabad, the important city of Pakistani Kashmir, is now going to be captured by Indians
 mujaffarabad par dabaav kam karne ke liye pakistan ne ek nayaa abhiyaan oparation grand slam shuru kiya
 On 1 September 1965, Pakistan, under an operation called Grand Slam, attacked the strategic city of Akhnoor, Jammu and Kashmir, from a strategic drift
 is abhiyaan kaa uddeshy kashmir ghati kaa shesh bharat se sampark tod tha taaki uski rasad or sanchaar vayvastha bhang kar di jaay
 India was not ready for this invasion of Pakistan and Pakistan was getting the benefit of large number of soldiers and better type of tanks
 shuruwat main bharat ko baari kshati uthaani padi is par bhartiya sena ne hawaii hamale kaa upyog kiya iske jawaab main pakistan ne punjab or srinagar ke hawaii thikaano par hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan was in a very good position during this phase of the war and this unexpected attack caused panic in the Indian camp
 akhnur ke pakistani sena ke haath main jane se bharat ke liye kashmir ghati mehar kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa tha
 There were two reasons for the failure of the Grand Slam
 The first and the biggest reason was that Pakistan's military command changed its military commander at the mouth of the victory, in such a way, the Pakistani army was delayed by a day and those 24 In the hour, India got an opportunity to bring additional troops and goods to protect Akhnoor
 Local commanders of the Indian Army themselves were aghast why Pakistan gave up such an easy victory
 Used to be
 ek din kii deree ke baavjood bharat ke pashchimi kaman ke sena pramukh yah jaanate the ki pakistan bahut behatar sthiti main he or usko rokane ke liye unhone yah prastaav tatkaaleen senadhyaksh general choudhary ko diya ki punjab seemaa main ek nayaa morcha khol kar lahore par hamalaa kar diya jaay
 General Chaudhary did not agree with this, but the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri ignored the matter and ordered the attack
 bharat ne 6 sitambar ko antarrashtriya seemaa rekha ko paar kar pashchimi morche par hamalaa kar yuddh kii aadhikarik shuruwat kar di
 On September 6, India's 15th infantry unit faced a major Pakistani attack on the western side of the Ichogil Canal under the leadership of Major General Prasad, a World War II veteran
 icchhogil nahar bharat or pakistan kii vaastavik seemaa thi
 Major General Prasad's convoy was also attacked in this attack and had to leave his vehicle and run away
 bharat ne pratinkraman main barki gaanv ke sameep nahar ko paar karne main safalataa arjeet kar lee
 This led the Indian Army to attack Lahore air base and as a result the US appealed for a temporary ceasefire to evacuate its citizens from Lahore
 isi bich pakistan ne lahore par dabaav ko kam karne ke liye khemkaran par hamalaa kar us par kabja kar liya badale main bharat ne bediyaan or uske aas paas ke gaavon par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack on Lahore on 6 September included the first infantry division of the Indian Army along with three tank squads of the second armored subdivision
 ve turant hi seemaa paar karke icchhogil nahar pahuch gayi pakistani sena ne puliyaaon par raksha daste tainaat kar diye jin pulo ko bachaaya nahin ja saktaa tha unako uda diya gaya pakistan ke is kadam se bhartiya sena kaa aage badhnaa ruk gaya
 The 3 Jats, a unit of the Jat Regiment, crossed the canal and captured Dograi and Batapore
 usee din pakistani sena ne bakhtarband ikai or vayusena kii madad se bhartiya sena kii 15ve khand par bada pratiakraman kiya haalaaki isse 3 jat ko maamuli nuksaan hi hua lekin 15ve khand ko peeche hatana padaa or uske rasad or hathiyaaro ke vahno ko kaaphi kshati pahuchi
 The big officers of the Indian Army did not know the ground situation properly, so they ordered the 3 Jats to retreat, fearing that the 3 Jats had also suffered heavy losses, this caused a lot of disappointment to the command officer of the 3 Jats and later on Dograi Then there was a huge cost to capture
 8 disambar 1965 ko 5 maratha lit infentry kaa ek dasta ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn kasbe munaabaav main tainaat rajasthan sainya bal kly majbootee pradaan karne ke liye bheja gaya
 They were ordered to stop the Pakistani army from advancing but they could only protect their outpost amidst heavy bombardment by the artillery of the Pakistani army and aerial and infantry offensive, 5 Maratha soldiers showed great valor
 As a result, today that outpost is known as Maratha Hill
 5 maratha kii madad ke liye bheje gayi 3 gurkha or 954 baari topakhana kaa dasta pakistani vaayu sena ke baari hamale ke kaaran pahuch nahin paaya or rasad le kar barmer se aa rahi tren bhi garda road rail adde ke paas hamale kaa shikaar ho gayi 10 sitambar ko munaabao par pakistan kaa kabja ho gaya
 The events after 9 September crushed the proud pride of the armies of both the countries
 bharat ke 1 bakhtarband khand jise bhartiya sena kii shaan kaha jaataa tha ne sialkot kii disha main hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan's relatively weak 6 armored division in Chhavinda was defeated badly
 The Indian Army lost about 100 tanks and was forced to retreat
 isse utsahit hokar pakistan kii sena ne bharatiyon par pratiakraman kar diya or bhartiya seemaa main aage ghus aayi
 For their final offensive, Pakistan along with its 1st Armored Division and 11th Infantry Division attacked Khemkaran with the intention of occupying Amritsar
 unke anusaar amritsar ke baad jalandhar or phir raashtrapati ayub khan kii taraf se aaye bayaan ke anusaar dilli aglaa lakshya hota
 The Pakistani Army moved ahead of Khemkaran as India's fourth mountain division, 7 Mountain Brigade, 62 Mountain Brigade, Deccan Horse, equipped with Sherman tanks, stood for battle with their other division

 After this, this place came to be known as Patton Nagar over the Pakistani tanko named Patton made in America
 is ladaai ke baad pakistan kii pehali bakhtarband divijan ko waapas sialkot bhej diya gaya jahaan phir usne yuddh main aage bhaag nahin liya
 By this time, the war had come to a standstill and both the countries were paying more attention to protect the areas they had won
 ladaai main bhartiya sena ke 3000 or pakistani sena ke 3800 jawan shahid ho chuke the
 India occupied 710 square kilometers in the war and Pakistan occupied 210 square kilometers

 For the first time since independence in this war, the planes of the Indian Air Force and the Pakistani Air Force fought each other
 isse pehle in donon vaayu-senaaon ne 1940 ke dashak main pratham kashmir yuddh main hissaa liya tha jisamen ki 1965 yuddh kii tulana main inkaa yogadan bahut kam or keval parivahan tak hi simit tha
 The Indian Air Force had a large number of Hawker Hunters, Faland Nate, De Havilland Vampires, EE Canberra bombers and a squadron of mig-21s built in India
 pakistani vaayu sena ke fadter plane the- 102 F-86F saibar or 12 F-104 starfiter, or 24 B-57 canberra bamavarshak
 The ratio of India and Pakistan Air Forces during the conflict was 5: 1
 halanki yuddh main donon vayusenaayen samaan thim, kyonki china ke yuddh main pravesh karne kii sambhaavna se bachane ke liye adhiktar bhartiya vaayu sena purv kii ore tainaat thi
 Pakistani aircraft were mostly American, while India had a mixed fleet of Soviet and European aircraft
 aisa bahut prasaarit tha ki pakistan ke america vimaan bharat ke vimaanon se behatar hai, lekin kich visheshgyon ke anusaar yah sahi nahin tha kyonki bhartiya vaayu sena ke mig 21, hoker hunter or folland nait fiter kii parformens unke pratidwandvi pakistan ke F-86 saibar se behatar thi
 According to Air Commander Sajjad Haider, who led Pakistan's No
 19 Squadron in the war - although the Indian Air Force vampire fighter aircraft were older and weaker than the F-86 Saber, Hunter aircraft were superior to them both in strength and speed
 bharatiyon ke anusaar F-86 chote se folland nait ke saamne kamazor tha jiske kaaran in vimaanon ko "saibar naashak" kaha jane laga tha
 The Pakistan Air Force's F-104 Starfighter was the fastest flying fighter aircraft in the subcontinent at the time and was often called the "pride of the Pakistan Air Force"
 lekin sajaad haidar ke anusaar ve vimaan is sammaan ke laayak nahin the kyonki ye "40,000 feet se adhik kii oonchai par udne vaale soviet bamavarshakon ko rokane va muqabla karne ke udeshy" se bane the, naa ki kam oonchaai par tej tarraar fiter vimaanon ke saath ladane ke liye
 Therefore, they were not suitable for the atmosphere of that time
 " bhartiya vayusena starfiter kii vajah se chintit thi, kintu ladaai main ye utane prabhavi sabit nahin hue jitne ki kahin adhik dhime kintu kahin adhik furtile,folland nait fiter
 Yet with the supersonic pace in the feud battle between Saber and Nats, Saber was far more successful
 donon deshon ne ladaai main hue nuksaan ke ek-duusare ke vipareet daawey kiye hai tathaa kuch hi tatasth sutron ne unka satyaapan kiya he
 The Pakistani Air Force claimed that it dropped 104 aircraft from India and lost 19 of its aircraft, while the Indian Air Force claimed that it dropped 73 aircraft from Pakistan and lost 35 of its aircraft
 ek tatasth strot ke anusaar, yuddh samaapti ke sheeghra baad hi hui ek parade main pakistani vayusena ne 86 F-86 saibar, 10 F-104 starfiter, or 20 B-57 canberra vimaan udaae jisase ki bhartiya vayusena kaa 73 pakistani vimaan giraane kaa daawa galat prathit hota he, jo ki us samay pakistan kii ladaaku vimaanon kii lagbhag sampurna pratham pankti thi
 Pakistan sources have denied claims of losing only one squadron of the Pakistan Air Force, stating that Pakistan had sought additional aircraft from Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and China within 10 days of the initial war
 swatantra sutron ke anusaar, pieef ne kuch 20 vimaan kho die the jabaki bharatiyon ne 60-75 vimaan kho diye the
 Pakistan lost 17 percent of its front-line strength by the end of the war, while India's losses were less than 10 percent
 iske alaava, yah anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki yadi sangharsh teen saptaah tak or chalati to pakistani nuksaan main 33 pratishat kii or badhotaree hoti or bharat kaa nuksaan 15 pratishat hota
 In the 1965 war, the largest wars of tanks were fought after World War II
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, bharat fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T
H
 Malik
 At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armored cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armored divisions, the 1st and 6th armored divisions - the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armor, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar 
; They were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armored Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, bharat's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded

 The brief table of claims of the two countries is as follows There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; Each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy — on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time United Nations intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on US ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, India had the better of the war
 New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 varg mile of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 varg mile of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 The United States and the Soviet Union used important diplomatic equipment to prevent further escalation in conflict between the two South Asian countries

 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, India budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, India reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 December killing one Pakistani Army captain and on 2 February 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 Due to many strategic mistakes made by both India and Pakistan, this war came to a disastrous situation
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defense of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian Army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 " Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani Air Marshal and Commander in Chief of PAF during the war, Noor Khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; The war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan As such, India agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, India was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war - Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, bharat's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, bharat focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, bharat established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy - India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", SM Burke writes - After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote - The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; This result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during the early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defense spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defense spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government advisory
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, India did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, saanchaa:pakistani sena Sully Prudhom was a French poet and essayist
