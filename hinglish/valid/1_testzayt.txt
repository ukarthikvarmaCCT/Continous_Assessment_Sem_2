 Only four types of Plasmodium parasites affect humans, the most dangerous of which are considered Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, as well as Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae
 is saare samooh ko 'malaria paraseete' kehete hai
 The female anophyllase mosquito is the carrier of the malaria parasite

 The earliest description dates back to 2700 BC from China
 malaria shabd kii utpatti madhyakaalin italian bhashaa ke shabdon maala aria se hui he jinka arth he 'buree hawa'
 It was also called 'swamp fever' or 'egg' as it spread widely in marshy areas
 malaria par pehle pahal gambhir vaigyanik adhyayan 1880 me hua tha jab ek francisi sainya chikitsak charles lui alphons laveren ne algeria main kaam karte hue pehali baar laal rakt koshika ke andar paraseete ko dekha tha
 He then proposed that this protozoan parasite is the cause of malaria disease
 is tathaa anya khojon hetu use 1907 kaa chikitsa nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 This protozoa was named by Plasmodium Italian scientists Ettore Marchiafava and Angelo Sealy
 iske ek varsh baad cubai chikitsak carlos finle ne pit fever kaa ilaaj karte hue pehali baar yah daawa kiya ki machhar rog ko ek manushya se duusare manushya tak failaate hai
 But the work of certifying it as irrefutable was done by Sir Ronald Ross of Britain in 1898 while working in Secunderabad
 inhone machharon kii vishesh jatiyon se pakshiyon ko katwa kar un machharon kii laar grathiyon se paraseete alag kar ke dikhaaya jinhe unhone sankramit pakshiyon main paala tha
 For this work he received the Medical Nobel of 1902

 Although some patients died of malaria, it was considered better than definite death from syphilis
 yadhpi malaria paraseete ke jivan ke rakt charan or machhar charan kaa pataa bahut pehle lag gaya tha, kintu yah 1980 me ja kar pataa laga ki yah yakrut me chhipe rup se maujuud rah saktaa he
 This discovery solved the mystery as to why patients recovering from malaria suddenly suffer from the disease after years

 As an exception, all urban-rural areas in Africa suffer from this, although the risk is less in large cities
 1960 ke dashak ke baad se kabhi iske vishwa vitaran ko mapa nahin gaya he
 Recently, the Wellcome Trust of Britain has given financial support to the Malaria Atlas Project for this work, so that the current and future distribution of malaria can be studied better

 Malaria is spread by protozoa parasites of Plasmodium gana
 is gana ke chaar sadsy manushyon ko sankramit karte hai- plasmodium failciparum, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium ovel tathaa plasmodium malarie
 The most dangerous of these is believed to be P
 falciparum, which accounts for 80 percent of malaria cases and 90 percent of deaths
 yah paraseete pakshiyon, rengne vaale jeevon, bandaron, chimpaziyon tathaa chuhon ko bhi sankramit karata he
 Infections in humans are also known by many other types of plasmodium, but are negligible except for P

 Additionally, larvae have to repeatedly come to the surface of the water to breathe
 andey-larva-pupa or phir vayask hone main machhar lagbhag 10-14 din kaa samay lete hai
 Adult mosquitoes thrive on pollen and other sugary foods, but female mosquitoes need blood to lay eggs
 malaria paraseete kaa pehla shikaar tathaa vaahak maadaa anopheleas machhar banati he
 Young mosquitoes take the malaria parasite from its blood upon biting the infected human
 rakt main maujuud paraseete ke jananaanu machhar ke pet main nar or maadaa ke rup main viksit ho jate hai or phir milakar andanu bana lete hai jo machhar kii antadiyon kii diwaar main palane lagate hai
 When they mature, they burst and the spores that come out of it reach the salivary glands of that mosquito
 machhar phir jab swasth manushya ko katata he to twachaa main laar ke saath-saath bijaanu bhi bhej detaa he
 These spores in the human body then germinate to form germs, which then spread the infection further
 iske alaava malaria sankramit rakt ko chadhaane se bhi fail saktaa he, lekin aisa hona bahut asaadhaaran he
 The development of malaria parasites in humans takes place in two stages: first stage in liver and second stage in red blood cells
 jab ek sankramit machhar maanav ko katata he to bijaanu maanav rakt main pravesh kar yakrut main pahonchte hai or sharir main pravesh paane ke 30 minute ke bheetar yakrut kii koshikaon ko sankramit kar dete hai
 Then they start asexual reproduction in the liver
 yah charan 6 se 15 din chalata he
 Thousands of bacteria are formed from this germ which break into their guest cells and enter the blood and start infecting red blood cells
 isse rog kaa doosraa charan shuru hota he
 Some spores of P
 vivax and P
 ovale infect the liver and stop and become inactive as crypts
 ye 6 se 12 maas tak niskriy rah kar phir achaanak anshaanuon ke rup main prakat ho jate hai or rog paidaa kar dete hai
 These parasites keep re-multiplying themselves by entering the red blood cell
 ye valay rup main viksit hokar phir bhojau or phir bahunabhikeey shysont or phir anekon anshaanu bana dete hai
 From time to time, these bacteria break down nutrient cells and infect new red blood cells
 aise kai charan chalate hai
 Fever attacks in malaria cause thousands of bacteria to affect new red blood cells simultaneously
 malaria paraseete apane jivan kaa lagbhag sabhi samay yakrut kii koshikaon yaa laal rakt koshikaon main chupa rahakar bitaata he, isliye maanav sharir ke pratiraksha tantra se bachaa rah jaataa he
 P
 falciparum is another trick to avoid damage to the spleen - it causes a sticky protein to appear on the surface of the red blood cell causing the infected blood cells to stick to the small blood vessels and not reach the spleen
 
 is kaaran raktadhara main keval valay rup hi dikhte hai, anya sabhi vikaas ke charnon main yah choti rakt vahikaaon kii satahon main chipka rahata he
 Due to this stickiness, malaria causes bleeding problems
 yadhyapi sankramit laal rakt koshika kii sataha par pradarshit protein piefiempi1 sharir ke pratiraksha tantra kaa shikaar ban saktaa he, aisa hota nahin he kyonki is protein main vividhta bahut zyada hoti he
 Each parasite has 60 types of it, while all of them can display this protein in myriad forms
 ve baar baar is protein ko badal kar sharir ke pratiraksha tantra se ek kadam aage rahete hai
 Some bacteria turn into male-female genomes and when the mosquito bites, carries them with blood
 yahan ve phir se apana jivan chakra puraa karte hai
 In many malaria-prone areas, every patient with fever is given a presumptive diagnosis of malaria and treatment is started with quinine
 iske saath hi rakt kii patticas bhi bana lee jaati hai, lekin ilaaj shuru karne ke liye iske parinaamon kii pratiksha nahin kii jaati
 This is also done in many areas where facilities for general laboratory tests are not available
 lekin malawi main hua ek adhyayan bataata he ki bukhaar ke saath-saath yadi guda kaa taapmaana, nakhunon main raktaheenata or tilli ke aakaar ko bhi dhyaan main liya jaae to malaria ke anaavashyak upachaar se bahut bachaa ja saktaa he 
 )
 rakt patticoon kaa sookshmdarshi se pareekshan karnaa malaria ke nidaan kaa sabase sasta, acha tathaa bharosemand tarika mana jaataa he
 The specific symptoms of the four malaria parasites can be diagnosed separately by this test
 rakt patticas do tarah se banaai jaati hai - patali or moti
 Thin plaques can better protect the parasite's texture, on the other hand, thicker plaques can allow more blood to be checked in less time and a lower volume of infection can be diagnosed

 malaria ke nidaan ke liye anek antigen-aadhaarit dipstick pareekshan yaa malaria rapid antigen test bhi uplabdh hai
 They require only one drop of blood, and in just 15–20 minutes, the result is not required, laboratory is not required
 ye sookshmdarshi jaanch se thode kamatar maane jate he
 But in areas where microscopic examination facilities are not available or the examiners do not experience the diagnosis of malaria, antigen testing can be done with a drop of blood in the affected area
 sabase pehle in pareekshanon kaa vikaas pi
 failciparum ke kinvak glutamet deehydrogenez ko antigen ke rup main prayog karke kiya gaya
 But soon a test called optimal-it was developed using another enzyme lactate dehydrogenase
 ye kinvak rakt main adhik samay tak maujuud nahin rahete or paraseete kaa khaatmaa ho jane par ye bhi rakt se nikal jate hai, atah in pareekshanon kaa upyog ilaaj kii safalataa yaa vifaltaa jaanane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 optimal-it can also differentiate between falciparum and non-falciparum malaria
 yah pi
 failciparum kaa 0
01 pratishat or gaiyr-failciparum malaria parjiviyon kaa 0
1 pratishat tak rakt main nidaan kar saktaa he
 Additionally, P
 falciparum can diagnose up to 0
002 percent of malaria parasites in the parachoc-pf blood based on specific histidine-rich proteins, but does not distinguish between falciparum and non-falciparum malaria
 inke atirikt polimarez shrinkhalaa abhikriya kaa prayog karke or aanvik vidhiyon ke prayog se bhi kuch pareekshan viksit kiye gaye hai, lekin ye abhi kaaphi mahange hai, tathaa keval vishisht prayogshaalaon main hi uplabdh hai
 There is still a need to develop cheap, sensory and simple tests that can be used to diagnose malaria in the region
 gambhir malaria ko africa me praayah pahchaan lene main galati hoti he, jiske chalate anya pranaghatak bimariyon kaa ilaaj bhi nahin ho paata he
 The presence of parasites in the blood can be caused not only by severe malaria, but also by many other deadly diseases
 haal ke adhyayan bataate hai ki malaria-janit moorchha or gaiyr-malaria-janit moorchha main antar karne ke liye malarial retinopathy kisi bhi anya pareekshan se behatar he
 Some cases of malaria are emergencies and it is mandatory to keep the patient under observation until they are completely healthy, but in other types of malaria it is not necessary, treatment can be done in outpatients
 uchit ilaaj hone par marij bilkul thik ho jaataa he
 Some symptoms are treated with normal medicines, along with anti-malarial drugs

 Many drugs are used only for resistance or treatment only, while others can be used both ways
 kuch davaayen ek-duusare ke prabhaav ko badhaati hai or inkaa prayog saath main kiya jaataa he
 Resistant drugs are often used collectively
 kunain par aadhaarit anek aushadhiyon ko malaria kaa acha upachaar samajha jaataa he
 Additionally, drugs such as artemisinin, which are prepared from a plant called Artemisia annua, have been found effective in treating malaria
 kuch anya aushadhiyon kaa prayog bhi malaria ke viruddh safal hua he
 Experimentation on some drugs is in progress
 dawa ke chunaav main sabase pramukh kaarak hota he us kshetra main malaria paraseete kin dawaaon ke prati pratirodh viksit kar chukaa he
 Many medicines which were earlier considered successful against malaria are not considered successful nowadays because malaria parasites have gradually acquired immunity against them
 homeopathy main malaria kaa upachaar uplabdh he, haalanki anek chikitsakon kaa maananaa he ki malaria jaisi gambhir beemaari kaa ilaaj allopathic dawaaon se hi kiya janaa chaiye, kyonki ye vaigyanik shodh par aadhaarit hai
 Even the advice of the British Homeopathic Association is that homeopathy should not be depended on for the treatment of malaria
 ayurveda main malaria ko visham fever kaha jaataa he or iske upachaar ke liye anek aushadhiyaan uplabdh hai
 Although effective treatment of malaria is available today, in many underdeveloped regions of the world, it is either not available in malaria affected areas or is so expensive that the common patient is unable to use it
 malaria kii dawaaon kii badhati maang ko dekhakar anek prabhavit deshon me bade paimaane par nakli dawaaon kaa kaarobaar hota he, jo anek mrityuon kaa kaaran banataa he
 Nowadays companies are trying to tackle this problem by using new techniques
 malaria kaa prasar in karkon par nirbhar karata he- maanav jansankhya kaa ghanatv, machharon kii jansankhya kaa ghanatv, machharon se manushyon tak prasar or manushyon se machharon tak prasar
 If any one of these factors is reduced too much, then malaria can be eradicated from that area
 isiliye malaria prabhavit kshetron me rog kaa prasar rokane hetu dawaaon ke saath-saath machharon kaa unmoolan yaa unase kaatane se bachane ke upaay kiye jate hai
 Many researchers claim that the cost of prevention against malaria treatment will be less in the long run
 1956-1960 ke dashak me vishwa str par malaria unmoolan ke vyapak prayaas kiye gayi 
 But they could not succeed and malaria is still present in Africa at the same level
 machharon ke prajnan sthalon ko nasht karke malaria par bahut niyantran paaya ja saktaa he
 Mosquitoes breed in standing water, such standing water spaces should be covered, dried or drained or oil should be applied on the surface of the water, so that the mosquito larvae cannot breathe
 iske atirikt malaria-prabhavit kshetron main akasar gharon kii deevaaron par kitnashak dawaaon kaa chhidkaav kiya jaataa he
 Mosquitoes of many species digest the human's blood after sitting on the wall
 aise main agar deevaaron par kitnashkon kaa chhidkaav kar diya jaae to diwaar par baithte hi machhar mar jayega, kisi or manushya ko kaatane ke pehle hi
 The World Health Organization has recognized about 12 drugs for spraying in malaria-affected areas
 inamen dediti ke alaava paramathrin or deltamathrin jaisi davaayen shaamil hai, khaskar un kshetron me jahaan machhar dediti ke prati rodhak kshamta viksit kar chuke he
 Mosquito nets are successful in keeping mosquitoes away from people and prevent malaria infection to a great extent
 anopheles machhar chunki raat ko katata he isliye badi machharadaani ko charpai / bistar pe lataka dene tathaa iske dwaara bistar ko chaaron taraf se purnatah gher dene se suraksha puri ho jaati he
 Mosquito nets are not very effective measures in their own right, but if treated chemically, they become very useful
 malaria-prabhavit kshetron main malaria ke prati jaagrukta failaane se malaria main 20 pratishat tak kii kami dekhi gai he
 Also, diagnosis and treatment of malaria as soon as possible also reduces its prevalence
 anya prayaason main shaamil he- malaria sambandhi jaankaree ikatthi karke uskaa bade paimaane par vishleshan karnaa or malaria niyantran ke tareeke kitne prabhavi hai isaki jaanch karnaa
 One such analysis found that it is very important to treat people with symptomatic infections, because they contain a lot of malaria

 Prakrit, called Shaurseni, was a major language of northern India in the medieval period
 yah naatakon main prayukt hoti thi 
 Later Hindi-language groups and Punjabi developed from it
 digambar jain parampara ke sabhi jainacharyon ne apane mahakavy shauraseni main hi likhe jo unke aadrut mahakavy hai
 Shaurseni is the name of the Prakrit language which was prevalent in Madhya Pradesh in ancient times and whose center was Shursen ie Mathura and its surrounding region
 saamanyat: un samast lokbhashaon kaa naam praakrit tha jo madhyakaal main samast uttar bharat main prachlit huin
 Originally, there were many distinctions of Prakrit in terms of alphabetization, grammar and style, from the region itself, the main ones were - Magadhi and Ardh Magadhi Prakrit of East country, Pashchi Prakrit of Northwestern State and Shaurseni Prakrit of Madhya Pradesh
 maury samrat ashok se lekar alabhya pracheenatam lekhon tathaa sahitya main inhen prakriton or visheshat: shauraseni kaa hi prayog paaya jaataa he
 There is a law in Bharata Natyashastra whether to use Shaurseni Prakrit language in drama or other country languages as per the wishes of the users
 pracheenatam naatak ashwaghoshkrut hai unke jo khandavshesh uplabdh hue hai unamem mukhyat: shauraseni tathaa kuch anshon main magadhi or ardhamagadhi kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 The use of Shaurseni is also found mainly in Bhasa's plays
 pashchaatkaaleen naatakon kii pravriti gadhy main shauraseni or padya main maharashtri kii ore pai jaati he
 Modern scholars are of the opinion that from Shaurseni Prakrit itself, later on in order of linguistic development, those characteristics which are considered to be the characteristics of Maharashtri Prakrit
 vararuchi, hemchandra aadi vaiyakarnon ne apane-apane praakrit vyakaranon main pehle vistaar se praakrit saamaanya ke lakshan batalaaye hai or tatpashchaat shauraseni aadi prakruton ke vishesh lakshan nirdisht kiye hai
 Among them, the main characteristics of Shaurseni Prakrit were d in place of t and d in place of t between two vowels
 jaise ateet > adid, kathan > kadhan ; isi prakaar hi kriyaapadon main bhavati > bhodi, hodi ; bhutva > bhodun, hodun
 According to linguistics, the letters t and d and V, which came in the middle of the words of the second century of Jesus, were also omitted and this was considered to be the specialty of Maharashtri Prakrit
 praakrit kaa uplabhy sahitya rachana kii drushti se is kaal se parvarti hi he
 Therefore, the Maharashtri mixed form is not included in the pure form of Shaurseni in it and for this reason scholars like Pishal have named him Jain Shaurseni or Jain Maharashtri according to the majority of the said tendencies
 jain shauraseni sahitya dingbar jain parampara kaa paaya jaataa he
 These are the major compositions - the oldest Pushpadanta and the geometrical form of the hexhandagam and the sutra scripture called the virtuous Kashay Prabhrita

 All these compositions are prophetic

 The main works related to the Muni ethos are the Bhagwati Aradhana performed by Shiva and the Mulachara by Vattaker
 anupreksha arthath anitya, asharan aadi baarah bhavanaayen bhavashuddhi ke liye jain muniyon ke vishesh chintan or abhyaas ke vishay hai
 Kundakundacharya has summarized these sentiments in his composition called 'baras Anusvekkha', the detail of which is also found in the Karttikeyanupraksha, the Karta whose name is Swami Karthikeya
 
 The Yatri Vrishabharyakrita Tiloypannanti describes in detail the Tralakya according to Jain belief, and the Jambudweep in the Padmanasabandit Jambudiivapanatti

 Its rendering is found in the Shaurseni Prakrit in compositions called Devasenakta miniature and Brihat Nayachakra

 Although the first scholarly editor of Karporamanjari, Dr
 Stancono attempted to bring the trends of Shaurseni in prose and Maharashtri Prakrit in verse on the strength of one of his beliefs against the evidence of dozens of ancient copies, Dr
 Manmohan Ghosh called this trend inappropriate
 The trend of Shaurseni is attested in Sattak itself

 It was established in 1791

 In 1958, it was merged with Sampurnanand Sanskrit University
 To establish their rule in India, the officers of the East India Company thought in necessary to preserve the knowledge of Hindus and Muslims
 In the year 1750 they passed a resolution for that purpose
 To preserve Urdu, they established a Madarsa at Calcutta, whereas for protection and development of Sanskrit, they chose Benares
 In 1791, during the period of British rule in India, Jonathan Duncan, the representative of the Honourable East India Company proposed the establishment of a Sanskrit college for development and preservation of the Sanskrit Vangmaya and to show that the English people were in favour of the development of the Indian culture
 This was sanctioned by Governor General Lord Cornwallis
 Kashi Naresh Mahip Narayan Singh donated a huge tract of land in the southern part of Benares for construction of the college
 The first teacher of this Institution was Pandit Kashinath
 The Governor General initially sanctioned a budget of Rs
 20,000 per annum
 Initially the college offered courses up to graduation
 From 1857, the College started Postgraduate teaching
 The examination system was adopted in 1880
 In 1894 the famous building of Saraswati Bhavan Granthalaya, where thousands of manuscripts are preserved, was constructed,
 These manuscripts are edited by the Principal of the College and published in book form
 The series of books are known as Sarasvati Bhavana Texts
 More than 400 books have been published in the series 

 From 1791 to 1844 the college was governed by the Administrative officers of the city
 Later British officers decided that Indians should also obtain knowledge of European literature and Philosophy
 Therefore they ordered the appointment of a Principal for the college
 The qualification laid down was the Principal must be a scholar of Sanskrit with knowledge of European literature and philosophy
the Principals from 1844 were: The Hafthali was a nomadic caste living in Central Asia in the 5th and 6th centuries AD
