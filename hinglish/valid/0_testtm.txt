 There is a predominance of devotion in it
 iske do prasang 'krishna kii bal-lila’ or 'bhramaragit-prasang' atyadhik mahatvapurn hai
 Regarding this, Acharya Shukla Nai has said, The most touching and eloquent part of Sursagar is misguided
 acharya shukla ne lagbhag 400 padon ko sursagar ke bhramaragit se chhaantkar unako 'bhramaragit saar' ke rup main sangrah kiya tha
 In the Bhramargeet, Surdas has included those verses in which Krishna sends Uddhav to Braj with messages from Mathura
 uddhav yoga or brahm ke gyaata hai
 They have no connection with love
 jab gopiyaan vyakul hokar uddhav se krishna ke bare main baat karti hai or unke bare main jaanane ko utsuk hoti hai to ve niraakaar brahm or yoga kii baaten karne lagate hai to khiji hui gopiyaan unhen 'kaale bhanware' kii upama detii hai

 To ionize, atoms or molecules have to give some charged particles or some charged particles have to be taken from it

 shankars vikali bharat main prakashit pehali cartoon patrika thi
 Its frequency used to be weekly
 shankars vikali kaa prakaashan bharat main cartoon kala ke pitamah kahe jane vaale cartoonist ke shankar pillai ne prarambh kiya tha
 Shankers Weekly was Shankar's dream which came true in 1948
 bharat ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pandit jawaharlal nehru ke haathon shankars vikali kaa vimochan hua
 Shunkers Weekly used to publish political and social cartoons of many well-known cartoonists of India including cartoons of many cartoonists like Ranga, Kutty, Bal Thackeray and Kak-cartoonist
 apane lambe kaarykaal main is patrika ne charchit cartooniston ke cartoonon ke prakaashan ke saath hi nae cartooniston ko bhi manch pradaan kiya
 Shunkers Weekly gave many cartoonists who later went on to gain considerable fame
 jane-maane cartoonist ranga or ve ji narendra ne to shankars vikali se hi apane cartoonist jivan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Shunkers Weekly was a weekly magazine based on purely Indian political cartoons, with sharp cartoons on cartoonist leaders and government activities across India

 It is still remembered with respect in the history of Indian journalism as a Hindi satirical magazine
 japani bhashaa japan desh kii mukhyabhasha or rajbhasha he
 Japanese was also spoken in Korea, Farmosa and Sakhalin before the Second World War
 ab bhi korea or formosa main japani jaananevaalon kii sankhya paryaapt he, parantu dhire dhire unki sankhya kam hoti ja rahi he
 Linguists consider it an 'vulgar-yogic language'
 japani bhashaa chini-tibeti bhashaa-parivaar main nahin aati
 Linguists place it in their own Japanese-language family
 ye do lipiyon ke mishran main likhi jaati hai : kanji lipi or kaana lipi 
 This language has a large system of respectful words and a "pitch-system" is necessary in speaking
 isamen kai shabd chini bhashaa se liye gayi hai
 No definite opinion has been established so far as to which language is included in the Japanese language
 parantu yah spasht he ki japani or korian bhashaaon main ghanishtha sambandh he or aajkal anek vidwaanon kaa mat he ki korian bhashaa altike bhashaakul main sanmilit kii jaani chahie
 The Japanese language also has many pronunciation and grammatical features that are similar to other Altaï languages, but these characteristics are still not quite understood in which we can say with certainty that the Japanese language is one of the Altaic languages
 hiku isaki pramukh kavy vidha he
 When the Japanese language starts, nothing can be said with certainty due to lack of evidence in this regard
 teesri shatabdi main likhi gai ek chini pustak main japan ke kuch sthanon or logon ke naam milte hai jinase anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki us samay japani bhashaa kaa vikaas ho chukaa tha
 In the 7th-8th century the Japanese learned the Chinese language and script, and history, geography, etc
 were written in the Chinese language
 dhire dhire chini lipi main japani bhashaa likhane kaa upaay khoj nikaala gaya
 The earliest collection of poems in Japan, Manyosheu, was written in this way
 chini bhashaa ke shabd ekmaatrik hote hai
 For this reason, it was very easy to reveal the pronunciation of the Japanese language with each of its scriptmarks
 is prakaar kii lipiyon ko "manyo" lipi kehete hai
 The study of these scripts showed that there were eight types of vowels and vowel analogies in the Japanese language of that time
 ab bhi cocoro, atama aadi shabdon kii bhanti ek hi swar se bane anek shabd he
 Japan's own culture developed as swapping with China ceased
 bhashaa main swar anurupata kaa lop ho gaya or swaron kii sankhya keval paanch rah gai
 Japan's own two types of scripts became "hiragana" and "katakana" by simplifying Chinese scripts
 hiraagaana chini lipi ko saral karke banaai gai
 Initially this script became especially popular among women
 chini lipi ko na milakar keval usee lipi main bhashaa likhi jaati thi
 a book written in Katakana Chinese was made to read like Japanese
 praaia: chini lipi chihn kaa ek bhaag lekar uskaa nirmaan hua tha
 From the beginning, this script was written in conjunction with Chinese scripts
 is samay china ke madhyam se japan main sanskrit bhashaa or lipi kaa adhyayan bhi aarambh ho gaya tha
 The alphabet of the new Japanese scripts was created in imitation of the Sanskrit alphabet
 is samay kaa raajnneetik centre pashchimi japan tha
 The arrival of soldiers from East Japan led to a change in language, especially pronunciation
 is samay senapatiyon kii shakti bad gai or kuch samay tak tokio ke nikat kamakura raajnneetik centre raho
 Due to many battles in this period, the tradition of ancient language started to break down and there was a big change in pronunciation and grammar
 is kaal ke antim bhaag main europe ke log lage or isai mat ke prasar ke uddeshy se unhone japani bhashaa kaa adhyayan kiya
 His written grammar and dictionary are available
 unki likhi anek pustakon se us samay kii japani bhashaa kaa haal acchhee bhanti janaa jaataa he
 At the same time printing developed and books of medicine etc
 were printed in Buddhism, Confucianism
 parantu chini bhashaa main likhi pustaken adhik chhaapi gayi or japani main likhi pustakon kii sankhya kam rahi
 Till this period, we can say the age of ancient language; But at the end of this time the language changed to the form of modern language
 is prakaar main samrat ke sthaan par tokugava parivaar ke log rajya karne lage, tokio rajdhani ho gaya tathaa jagiradaari paddati drudh ho gai
 Osaka was initially a cultural center, but by the late 18th century "edo" became a cultural center
 sahitya adhiktar edo kii boli main hi likhaa jane laga
 Many dialects developed during this period due to the country being divided into jagirs and the opportunity for people to come out
 uccharan aadhunik bhashaa kii bhanti ho gaya or vyakaran main kriya ke rupaparivartan ke niyamon kaa saral hona prarambh hua
 Initially, speakers of different dialects were gathered in Edo, but gradually their own dialect of Edo city developed
 yah or bhi viksit hokar aajkal kii sarvamaanya bhashaa ban gai he
 At this time, the study of ancient Japanese language and literature began to be studied a lot
 is samay se hirkaana main chini lipiyon ko adhik milakar likhane kii paddati pasand kii jane lagi
 During this period, the emperor himself began to rule, and Tokyo became the capital
 yahan kii boli sarvamaanya bhashaa maani jane lagi
 Contact with Europe was established and many words of Europe were translated into Chinese script and started becoming popular among the masses
 chini lipiyon ke atyadhik prayog main aa jane ke kaaran ek hi uccharanwale anek shabd ban gaye
 The translation of European literature led to the development of new styles in the language
 1887 se bolchaal kii bhashaa main sahitya shighrata ke saath lokapriy hota gaya
 Books of knowledge science have been written from left to right instead of being written from top to bottom in the writing style
 yah pravriti aajkal or bhi bad rahi he or dwitiya mahayuddh ke baad sarkari aagyaptr bhi bain se dayee ore likhe jate hai
 Now the promotion of the common language through the medium of magazine, radio, television etc
 is growing very fast and the language of Tokyo was understood and spoken in every corner of the country
 meji kaal ke aarambh main adhik prayog main ai chini lipiyon ko kam karnaa, chini lipi ko laghu rup main likhnaa, hirkaana or katakana ke prayog main ekarupata se aana, roman lipi prayog kaa adhyayan karnaa aadi aadi upayon se bhashaa ko yathasambhav saral banane ke liye praytn kiya ja rahaa he
 Since 1946, when the new constitution of Japan was written combining Hiracana and Chinese scripts, almost the same measures are being adopted in almost all the newspapers
 videshi shabdon ke uccharan kii nakal karte samay katakana kaa prayog hota he
 Some people use Katakana for typewriters but it has not become popular so far
 japani samaaj main bhartiya samaaj jaisi visheshtaon ke hone tathaa bhashaa ke bahut puraani hone ke kaaran japani bhashaa main anek boliyaan hai
 Jin has main Kyushu
 pashchimi japan tathaa purvi japan kii boliyo main, visheshkar unke uccharan main spasht antar he
 Because of the promotion of education since Meji period, the language of the most common language in every region is understood as the dialect of Tokyo
 kshetreey boliyon ke atirikt peshey, stri purush, ucch varg nimna varg aadi ke bhed se bhinn bhinn boliyaan boli jaati hai
 Along with each type of distinction above, each Japanese has to speak in three types of style, with the distinction of the great minor of the hearer, as well as the distinction of the great minor of each hearer
 apane se chote yaa baraabar ke logon se bolte samay da prakaar kaa vaakya, kuch bade se bolte samay desu prakaar kaa tathaa bahut aadar se baaten karte samay gozaimasu prakaar kaa vaakya bananaa padataa he
 In the written language also there are both Aru and Arimasu styles
 swar : a i u e o Consonants: Being always pronounced with a vowel is not just a consonant script
 vyanjan swar vaali lipi nimnlikhit he : Why should you ga gi gu ge go gy gu gyo Shi shi se so shy shyu shyo ja ji ju je jo jya ju jyo Ta chi tsu te to ch chyu jyo da de do Na Ni Nu Ne No Ny Nyo ha hi hu he ho ha hu hyo There are no special script marks for voicing
 aghosh lipi chihn par hi do nukte lagaae jate hai
 When the Japanese script was made, there were no accents such as Kykyu Kyo
 ye baad me chini bhashaa ke prabhaav se apanaae gaye hai
 Therefore, they are revealed by putting lowercase letters after the original script
 upar likhit uccharan ke atirikt do or hai : For n jab pakkaa, acha jaisaa shabd ho k ch k ch ko bhi ek maatra samajhate hai
 To reveal this volume, the small letter Tasu writes
 japani shabd sangitatmak swaraghaat ke hai
 There are very few types of accent
 chaar matraavaale shabdon main nimnlikhit keval chaar prakaar ke bhed hai
 The Japanese language has many words with the same pronunciation and different meanings
 swaraghaat main bhi un shabdon main bhed bataane kii shakti nahin he
 There is no difference in pronunciation of kami and kami
 ham keval unki chini lipi ko dekhne se hi donon kaa bhed jaan sakate hai
 But it tells the word group well in accented sentences
 nivaano sakuro mo minna chite shiritta Vatakushi and Nihongo no Benkyo o Shite Orimasu is prakaar ek vaakya main shabdon kaa sthaan sanyog se hindi se bahut miltaa he
 But some features are worth noting because the Japanese language is additive rather than coincidental
 sangya main vibhaktiyon kaa prayog nahin hota
 Supportive words or auxiliary verbs are used to indicate the relation of noun in a sentence
 upar ke vaakya main "main" ko prakat karne ke liye "vatakushi" main koi rupaparivartan nahin hua he
 The auxiliary word "V" is used to express the subject factor
 sangya main lingabhed nahin he, parantu manushya, jaanavar aadi chetan or achetan vastuon main kuch bhed he
 There is no distinction in the form of a noun, but in a later verb, there is a distinction in the form of a singular plural
 aadar athwa namrata prakat karne ke liye sangya main upsarg "o" lagaaya jaataa he
 Such as: Tegami xxrep 8 
 Letter otegaami xxrep 7 
 aapkaa patr There are different words to say with respectable, with equal, small-scale people or politely
 in shabdon kaa samuchit prayog karnaa bahut kathin he jaise main ke liye
 Vatakushi Hriday especially says women
 purush bhi bado ke saamne namrata prakat karne ke liye is shabd kaa prayog karte hai
 Airplane vashi, boku, ore, Atai: Little Girls kriya main rupaparivartan hota he
 a word is of two or more quantities
 1 kriya main ek visheshta mieru kichoeru jaise shabd hai jo keval achetan vastuon ke sambandh main prayukt kiye jate hai
 Like Hindi, verbs are formed by introducing a noun like - shippatsu suru parantu is prakaar kii kriyaaon ke sambandh main ek visheshta yah he ki jab aisi kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, kabhi kabhi "suru" lagaakar vaakya purna kiya jaataa he
 Like Rokuji Kisho
 shichiji shippatsu
 
 kuroi, aki, jaise ikraant ore shijukana, genkina, jaise nakaarant do prakaar ke shabd hai
 Adjectives also change like verbs
 manushya, jaanav aadi jeev jantu or achetan vastuon ke ginaney kii reeti bhinn bhinn he : The auxiliary word does not change form
 shabdon ke rup bahut chote hote hai hri adhiktar ek matraavaale
 Words longer than three volumes are too short
 ye shabd hindi ke sambandhbodhak tathaa samuchhyabodhak shabd kii vibhakti or kriyavisheshan kaa kaam karte hai

 chini lipiyon ko adhik lagaakar bahut bade, bade, kabhi kabhi 10-15 matraaon ke shabd bhi banaae ja sakate hai
 But due to the choice of three to four words, it is preferred to cut short any part of Chinese scripts and make short words like "nihon Kyoshokuin Kumiyi" instead of "nikkyoso" because of the many words being made in this way
 Words of utterance and many meanings are found very much
 chini shabd athwa chini lipiyon ko jodakar japan main bane shabd japani bhashaa main atyant mahatv kaa sthaan rakhte hai
 Some 10 percent of the words used in today's newspapers are such words
 chini lipiyon main likhe shabdon ko padhane main ek badi kathinaayee yah he ki ek ek lipi ke liye teen bhinn uccharan hai
 The reason is that Chinese scripts differed in the reigns of "kan" Rajkul, "go" Rajkul and "so" Rajkul in China, and that the Chinese language continued to influence the Japanese language in all three periods
 is prakaar chini uccharan ke anusaar padhane ke liye teen bhed hai
 In addition, when these scripts are used for their native words in Japan, these Chinese scripts are read in Japanese pronunciation according to their own meaning
 is prakaar kabhi kabhi ek chini lipi saat aath prakaar se padhi jaati he
 In the Meiji period when foreigners began to have influence in Japan, words like Club, Bucket, Blanket, Romantic, Tobaco were either written in Chinese script for their pronunciation or their meaning
 parantu aajkal aise shabd adhiktar katakana main likhe jane lage hai
 There are five per cent of such foreign words in modern Japanese language

 English and American words are the most among these

 Foreign words combined with Chinese language do not have variations

 kii vruddhi ke liye aavashyak ushma kii maatra ko 1 calories maan sakate hai
 Thermodynamics - The heat of an object is that of heat which is 1 cm
 For heating, that item has to be given, or 1 cent
 It is obtained by heating
 jal kii ushmadharita kii tulana main kisi padaarth kii ushmadharita ko us padaarth kii vishisht ushma kehete hai
 That is, the amount of heat required for any temperature increase of a mass of matter and the heat dissipation required for the same temperature rise of water of the same mass is called the specific heat of that substance
 1 gram jal kii 1° sein
 tapavriddhi ke liye aavashyak ushma 1 ekak ushma hoti he at: ek gram padaarth kii ushmadharita us padaarth kii vishisht ushma hoti he
 If the amount of heat required to raise an object of mass m to temperature is m, then the specific heat according to the aforesaid definition will be found in the following formula: kisi vastu ke dravyaman tathaa vishisht ushma ke gunanfal ko us vastu kii ushmadharita kehete hai
 It is also called the 'water balance' of that object
 saadharantaya vishisht ushma kii paribhaasha karte samay us paristhitiyon kaa nirdesan aavashyak he jinamein taapaparivartan hua ho
 For example, if compression increases the temperature of a gas, the value of dt will not be zero but dq = 0
 atev vishisht ushma vi shunya hogi
 On the other hand if a gas is given a finite amount of heat and its diffusion is such that its temperature is constant, then in this situation dt = 0 and dq will not be zero
 atev vishisht ushma bahut adhik hogi
 The diffusion of gas can also be done in such a way that some amount of heat is given to it but still its temperature declines; In this case, due to dt being negative, the value of its specific heat will also be a minus
 isse yah prathit hota he ki gas kii vishisht ushma kaa maan + ananat se - ananat ke bich kuch bhi ho saktaa he tathaa yah maan paristhitiyon se sambandhit he
 For this reason, it is very important to direct the conditions of temperature conversion with respect to the specific heat of the gas
 at: gas ke vishay main do vishisht ushmayen hoti hai : The volume changes in ordinary experiments are low and negligible due to less compression in liquids and solids
 at: ek hi vishisht ushma rah jaati he
 At each temperature, solid and liquid have a certain specific heat and increase with temperature
 isamen jal kaa taapan ek niyat taap tak kiya jaataa he tathaa is jal kii maatra se ushma kii maatra gyaat kii jaati he
 This method has the following practices: mishran vidhi, Cooling method, is vidhi dwaara rena ne param shuddh fal gyaat kiye
 If the mass of two substances a and b are m1 and m2 heat T1) and T2 and specific heat S1 and S2 and if they are placed with each other, the heat will go from one to the other and consequently their temperature will eventually be between T1 and T2
 a normal temperature will be t parinamat: yadi ushma kaa niyaman k tathaa kha hi main ho to k dwaara di gai ushma kha dwaara lee gai ushma ke tulya hogi- Here we have assumed that a and b neither take heat from other objects nor give them to them during the period of the equation of heat
 vyavhaar main yah avasthaa asambhav he
 Generally, heat is also exchanged with other things
 aisi trutiyon ko dur karne athwa kam karne kii vishesh reetiyaan hai
 The main tool for calorimetry experiments is a thermometer made of copper, brass or a thin sheet of silver
 yah ek bade bartan ke bheetar kuchaalak aadhaaron par rakhaa jaataa he
 The thermometer is filled with water of measured mass, in which a heated object of certain temperature is added and the temperature conversion is read from a microscopic thermometer
 jal ko chalaane ke liye usamen taanbe kaa muda hua vichaalak rahata he
 To remove or reduce heat loss by radiation, polishing is done on the outer floor of the thermometer and the inner floor of a large vessel
 kisi tapt padaarth ko ushmamapi ke jal main daalane par jal ke atirikt ushmamapi, vichaalak tathaa tapamapi kaa paara bhi tapt padaarth kii ushma lete hai tathaa unke taap main bhi vruddhi hoti he
 Therefore, it is also necessary to take account of their heaters
 tapantar kii vruddhi se vikiran shodhan main bhi vruddhi hoti he; is kaaran uchit yah he ki ushmamapi main jal kii maatra itani adhik lee jaae ki taap main adhik vruddhi na ho; parantu aisa karne se prayog kii sookshmata ghat jaati he
 To counteract this, the behavior of a microscopic thermometer becomes necessary
 yah vidhi is kalpana par nirdhaarit he ki jab koi vastu kisi samaavrutt main sheethal hoti he to samay kii us avadhi main uske dwaara utsarjit ushma dq vastu ke samaavrutt par, taap ke aadhiky par, uske tal kii prakruti par, tathaa tal ke kshetrafal par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore is sameekaran main vastu ke tal par, arthath uske kshetrafal tathaa vikiran shakti par nirbhar he, tathaa f taap ke aadhiky kaa agyaat falan he jo prayek vastu ke liye samaan hoga
 Therefore, if Newton's coagulation law is the case, then this function is only the temperature dt
 yadi dt avadhi main vastu tapantaral dt se sheethal hoti he to m is the code of the object and s is the specific heat
 at: If the area of the floor of both the objects is same then a = a 'then the following relation can be derived- arthath donon vastuon kii ushmadharitaayen un avadhiyon kii nishpatti hai jo un vastuon ko taap ke samaan paraas dwaara sheethal hone main lagati hai
 In this way perfect fruits are not available

 This object gives heat immediately to the ejection of the snow and this causes a certain amount of snow to liquefy
 purv taule hue ek spanj se is jal ko sokhkar spanj ko pun: taul lete hai tathaa dravit him kaa dravyaman gyaat kar lete hai
 If the initial temperature of the object is T, and mass m and specific heat S, then the amount of heat given by it will be m ST

 Based on this theory, Bunsen's snow thermometer is a highly sensitive tool to determine the specific heat of liquids and solids

 The roots of al-qaeda can be traced back to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan
 Immediately after the invasion, Osama bin Laden traveled to Afghanistan, where he helped organize the Arab Mujahideen and founded the Maktab al-khidmat) organization to resist the Soviets

 The idea of the September 11 plot came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who presented the idea to Osama bin Laden in 1996
 is samay, sudan se waapas afghanistan sthanantarit hokar, bin laden or al kaayda sankraman kii avasthaa main the
 The 1998 bombing of the African embassy and bin Laden's 1998 edict took a new turn, with bin Laden intending to attack America

 In late 1998 or early 1999, bin Laden approved Mohammed to proceed with the plot
 There was a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 between Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden and his Naib Mohammed Attef
 mohammad ne, lakshya ke chunaav tathaa aparankartaaon kii yatra kii vyavastha main sahaayta sahit sajeesh hetu kriyaatmak sahyog pradaan kiya
 Bin Laden overturned Mohammed's selection, rejecting such important goals as the US Bank Tower in Los Angeles because "there was not enough time to prepare for such an operation"
 bin laden ne aarthik sahaayta ke saath, sajeesh ke liye netritv pradaan kiya or vah sajeesh ke liye pratibhaagiyon ke chayan main shaamil tha
 Bin Laden initially selected veteran jihadists Nawaf al-hazmi and Khalid al-mihadhar who fought in Bosnia

 Bin Laden initially denied it, but later accepted participation in the events

 "this denial was broadcast on news channels in the US and around the world
 november 2001 main america sena ne jalalabad, afghanistan main ek nasht makaan se baraamad ek video tepe baraamad kiya jisamen osama bin laden khalid al-harabi se baat kar rahaa tha
 In the tape, Laden confessed that he had foreknowledge of the attacks
 is tepe ko 13 disambar 2001 se vibhinn samachar network par prasaarit kiya gaya
 The tape transfer technique has been attributed to its distorted image on the tape

 On 27 December 2001, a second video of bin Laden was released
 is video main vah kahata he ki, "hamaare logon ko maarane vaale israyal kaa samarthan karne se america ko rokane ke uddeshy se america ke khilaaf aatankwaad prashansa kaa hakdaar he, kyonki yah anyaay kii pratikriya thi," lekin usne hamalon kii jimmedaari sweekaar karnaa band kar diya
 In his taped statement, shortly before the US presidential election in 2004, bin Laden publicly acknowledged al-qaeda's involvement in the attacks on the US and acknowledged his direct contact with the attacks
 usne kaha ki hamale kiye gaye the, "kyonki ham azaad hai
 

and want to regain independence for our country
 jis prakaar aap hamaari suraksha ko kamjor samajhate hai, usee prakaar ham aapaki suraksha ko kamjor samajhate hai
 "osama bin Laden said that he had instructed his followers on the Zee Tour to attack the World Trade Center
 is video main usne kaha, "allaah us par meharbaan ho, ham commander general mohammad atta ke saath sahamat hue the ki bush or unke prashasan ko soochna milane se pehle, sara oparation 20 minute ke andar kriyanvit ho janaa chaiye

 To date, only superficial people have been prosecuted or convicted for attacks
 bin laden par abhi tak aupchaarik rup se hamalon kaa abhiyog nahin lagaaya gaya he
 On 26 September 2005, on the direction of Judge Baltasar Thunder, the Spanish High Court sentenced Abu Dahdah to 27 years imprisonment for conspiring in the 9 / 11 attack and being a member of the terrorist organization al-qaeda
 At the same time, the other 17 al-qaeda members were sentenced to sentences ranging from six years to eleven years
 On 16 February 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court reduced Dahdah's penalty to 12 years because he thought his involvement in the conspiracy was not proven
 hamalon ke uddeshyon main se ek, saudi arab main america upasthiti he
 Israel's support by the US, and sanctions against Iraq
 al-qaeda clearly stated these objectives in the declarations before the attacks, including an August 1996 fatwa and a small fatwa published in February 1998
 hamalon ke baad, bin laden or al zawaahiri ne atirikt video tepe or audio tepe prakashit kiye, jinamein se kuch main hamale ke kaarnon ko doharaaya gaya tha
 Two particularly important publications were bin Laden's 2002 "letter to America", and a 2004 bin Laden videotape
 In addition to direct declarations by bin Laden and al-qaeda, many political analysts have conceived motivations for the attacks
 11 sitambar ko hue aatankwaadi hamale or khobar tower kii bambaari ke peeche, saudi arab main khadi yuddh ke baad america sena kii nirantar upasthiti kaa haath mana jaataa he, sanyukt rajya america ke duutavas par 1998 kii bambaari america dalon ko saudi arab bheje jane ke aath saal baad hui
 bin laden ne paigambar mohammad ke "arab main kafiron kii sthaayee upasthiti" par roak lagane kii vyakhya kii
 In 1996, bin Laden issued a fatwa asking US forces to leave Saudi Arabia
 1998 ke fatve main al-kaayda ne likhaa "saat saal se adhik samay se islam kii bhoomi ke pavithratam sthanon, arab prayadweep par, sanyukt rajya america kabja kiye hue he, isaki daulat ko lut rahaa he, iske shaskaon ko hukum de rahaa he, iske logon kaa apmaan kar rahaa he, padausiyon ko aatankit kar rahaa he or prayadweep main iske addon ko padosi muslim logon se ladane ke liye haraval daston main parivartit kar rahaa he
 In a 1999 interview with Rahimulla Yusufzai, bin Laden said, he felt that Americans were "very close to Mecca" and considered it provocative to the entire Muslim world
 november 2002 main apane "america ke liye patr" main bin laden ne israyal ko sanyukt rajya america ke samarthan ko ek prerana bataaya: israyal kaa nirmaan or uski nirantarata sabase bade aparaadhon main se ek he or aap in aparaadhiyon ke netaa hai
 And of course there is no need to explain or prove the amount of US support for Israel
 israyal kaa nirmaan ek aparaadh he jise mitaa dena chahie
 Each and every person whose hands have been polluted by contributing to this crime, will have to pay the price for it and pay a heavy price
 " 2004 or 2010 main, bin laden ne phir se 11 sitambar ke hamalon or sanyukt rajya america dwaara israyal ke samarthan ke bich sambandh ko doharaaya
 Many analysts, including Mearsheimer and Walt, also consider Israel's support by the United States as the motivation for the attacks
 1998 ke fatve main al-kaayda ne iraq par pratibandh kii, amarikiyon ko maarane ke kaaran ke rup main pahchaan kii haih "mujahid-yahudee gathbandhan dwaara kii gai iraqi logon kii mahatbaahi ke baavjood, badi sankhya main logon ke maare jane ke baavjood, jo das lakh ko paar kar chuki he, is sab ke baavjood, america ek baar phir se bhayanak katleam ko doharaana chaahate hai, jaise ki ve ati krur yuddh yaa vikhandan or vinaash ke baad thopi gai lambii nakebandi se abhi santusht nahin hai
 

on this basis and in compliance with the command of Allah, we issue this fatwa to Muslims: "every Muslim's decision to kill Americans and their allies - civilians or soldiers - is a duty of Muslims
 

" In addition to the objectives published by Al Qaeda, analysts have suggested other objectives, including insults arising from the Islamic world lagging behind the Western world, a discrepancy that appears particularly due to recent globalization
