 vitt siddhant main vaarshik bhriti yaa varshiki kaa matlab aise bhugtan se he jo ekasmaan maatra main nishchit interval par ek nishchit avadhi tak kiya jaataa he
 For example, depositing a fixed amount in a savings account at regular intervals; Payment of EMI on the purchase of the house; Monthly insurance premium depositing etc

 Annual allowance: An annuity payable for the assistance of a poor or deserving person, or the allowance given in a year for the maintenance of a person, is called an annual allowance
 is prakaar kii sahaayta ke rup main diya gaya dhan anek kishton main, kisi nishchit samay ke antar par, jaise masik, tremasik yaa vaarshik, diya jaataa he
 More broadly, we can call any series of grants as Bhriti
 chaatravrutti tathaa pension se sabhi parichit hai
 The 15-year-old graffiti of the Government of India is also an example of this and the series of interest received on National Fund Savings Deposits is also called Bhriti
 anudaanon kii shrunkhlaa ke bhed se bhritiyon ke bhi anek bhed ho sakate hai
 Just as the rate of interest is usually given 'per year', even if the interest is payable multiple times in a year, similarly Bhriti is payable according to 'bhriti Dhan every year', no matter how many times in the year

 There are two types of frescoes, one which only deals with 'kaal', such as 15-year-old frescoes
 yahan par bhritipatr kaa maalik koi bhi ho, bhriti thik 15 varsh tak milti rahegi, na kam na adhik
 Therefore, these types of freshers can be called 'fixed period' or 'fixed' freshers

 Just as in life insurance, we cannot say how much money the insurer will get from the proposer in the insurance fee, similarly here also, we cannot say how much money the proposer will get in the form of allowance
 aisi bhriti ko 'jivan bhriti' kahenge
 Man's death is certain, but no one can tell his time

 ek prashn or aata he ki bhriti ke adhishthit hone se purv hi yadi bhritidaar kii mrityu ho jaae, to aisi dasha main yadi namit ko kuch na diya jaae to acha na hoga
 In fact, in case of the death of the proposer before his retirement, his dependents need more money
 atev saadhaarant: aisi dasha main die hue shulk waapas kar die jate hai
 Rs 1,025 The annual fee of Rs is for this type of recruitment scheme
 yah shart saath na hoti to shulk or kam hota
 From this point of view, it would probably be better to pay Rs 30,000 more
 40,000, or Rs
 40,000 Benefit insurance of 25 years should be taken in the Endowment Scheme and on attaining the age of 60 years, the life insurance should be taken immediately from the insurance money
 kintu sambhav he, 25 varsh baad sood kii daren gir jaaen or tatkaal dey bhriti kaa kray mulya bad jaae
 In such a situation, another way can be that both problems of life should be solved separately, at least in value
 pehle ke liye uchit dhanrashi kaa keval avadhi beemaa kiya jaae, jisen sevanivrutt hone se purv mrityu ho jane kii dasha main bimaadhan mili, anyathaa kud nahin
 For the longevity person, that deferred life should be given, in which nothing is found after death
 saadhaarant: aise bime die nahin jate, kintu samuhik beemaa yojanaon main praapt hote hai
 There is also a question of how much recruitment will be required on retirement, what will be the standard of living at that time and how will the value be? The answer is not easy, but one can say that if the recruitment is related to the income just before retiring, then the question gets resolved a lot

 The employer may bear a certain portion of the fee, such as quarter, or third, and the rest of the employee; Or the employee can bear a fixed part of salary, ie 5 or 7

 attharahavin or unnisvin sadi ke sandhikaal par sakriy in vichaarkon kaa kahana tha ki romani sahitya or kala kaa swabhaav taral or khandit he
 Therefore, that ambition to achieve wellness and fulfillment is not in him which is the main feature of classical literature and art
 jo romani he vah vyakhya kii samasyaon se grast rahegaa hi
 According to Schlegel, the works of art refuse to be 100 percent comprehensible on the ground of understanding
 august shlegal ne romani vidmbana kii thisis kaa pratipaadan karte hue kavita kii virodhabhasi prakruti ko rekhaankit kiya
 This meant that it is the nature of poetry not to accomplish any objective or definitive meaning

 According to Dr
 Amarnath, the creator of the technical terminology of Hindi criticism, the mention of Romanticism in Hindi is first found in the history of Hindi literature by Ramchandra Shukla's famous treatise, where he has described Sridhar Pathak as the originator of Romanticism
 amarnath ke anusaar chhayavaad or svachhndathawad main gaharaa samya he
 Both have visions of nature-love, human outlook, self-expression, mystification, personal love expression, paranoia towards ancient culture, symbol-planning, despair, exodus, sublimation of ego, etc

 This movement recognized strong emotions as the real source of aesthetic experience, with renewed emphasis on emotions such as panic, fear and terror, and awe - especially those emotions that are experienced in the face of sublime nature and its sublime qualities
 , Which are both new aesthetic categories
 isane lok kala or kuch uttam karne kii pracheen reeti, jo ki sahajata ke aichhik gun se yukt he ko aage badhaaya or prakruti dwaara bhashaa avan prachlit prayogon ke rup main anukulit maanav gatividhiyon kii ek "prakritik" gyaan mimasaa ke paksh main tark kiya
 To rise to the level of revivalist medievalism and elements of art and history, which are authentically considered medieval, went beyond the idealized models of libertarianism, rationalism and antiquarianism, from the limits of population growth, urban disorder and industrialism
 In an attempt to escape and it used its imaginations to flee and imagine further, foreigner, unfamiliarity And welcomed more authentic sources of remote and Rococo Cinoyiseri in terms of the medium

 Although the roots of this movement have developed from the German movement Sturm & Dreng, which values instincts and emotions as enlightenment rationalization, the French Revolution laid the foundations of ideals and events that set the backdrop for scholasticism and counter-enlightenment
 audyogic kranti kii parisimaaon kaa bhi swachhandathawad par prabhaav padaa, jo ek prakaar se aadhunik vaastaviktaaon se palaayan tha; vastav main, 19 veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main "yatharthwaad" ko swachhandathawad ke dhruviya vipareet ke rup main prastut kiya gaya

 vah aitihaasik or prakritik anivaaryta kaa ek shashakt avlamb tha or apane vichaaron ke pratinidhitiv main ek yugachetana 
 Fundamentally, the term "romanticism" was used to refer to some specific artists, poets, writers, musicians, as well as political, philosophical and social thinkers of the late 18th and early 19th centuries
 iskaa prayog saamaan rup se us yug ke anekon kala sambandhi, bauddhik or saamaajik chalanon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa tha
 Even after such general usage of the term, a brief description of Romanticism has been a subject of controversy throughout the 20th century in the areas of intellectual history and literary history and no specific measures could be obtained to agree on it
 arthur lavajoy ne apane history of idias ke nibandhon ke moulik lekh "on da discrimination of romentisism" main is samasya kii jatilta ko vyakt karne kaa prayaas kiya he; kuch vidwaan swachhandathawad ko vartmaan ke saath anivaary rup se satat maanate hai, kuch isamen aadhuniktaa ke praarambhik lakshanon ko dekhte hai, kuch ise gyanoday tarkwaad- gyanoday kaa vipareet, ke virodh kii parampara ke shuruyaat ke rup main dekhte hai or phir bhi kuch anya ise francisi kranti ke sidhe parinaam ke rup main dekhte hai
 An early definition that was given by Charles Boudlier: "in short, autonomy is neither situated in the choice of subject nor in the real truth, but rather it is a way of experience
" kai buddhijivi itihaaskaar swachhandathawad ko prati gyanoday ke mukhya aandolan ke rup main dekhte hai, joki gyanoday kaal ke virodh main ek pratikriya he
 While Enlightenment thinkers emphasized the superiority of deductive causes, Romanticism emphasized experience, imagination and emotion to the extent that some of its thinkers were also accused of being irrational
 haalaanki jab shabd "swachhandathawad" kaa prayog sangeet ke sambandh main kiya gaya vah samay takreeban 1820 se 1900 kaa tha, sangeet ke liye 'romani' shabd kaa samakaleen prayog is aadhunik spashtikaran se mail nahin khaataa tha
 In 1810 the E
T

 Hoffman named Mozart, Hayden, and Beethoven three "romani composers" and Ludwig Sphor used the words "good romantic style" to refer to parts of Beethoven's fifth symphony
 vaastaviktaa main mozart or heden pracheen sangeetkaar maane jate hai or adhikansh tathyon ke aadhaar par bithoven sangitamay romani yug kii shuruyaat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai

 isse unhen pataa lagata he ki doordarshee kaa mukh kis samay kis disha main rakhane se vah nakshatra dikhaai degaa
 From one place of observation, the place where a star appears in the sky, the next night will be found in the same constellation time in approximately the same direction
 jis prakaar surya or chandramaa purv main ugte hue tathaa pashchim main ast hote hue maaloom padate hai, usee tarah anya nakshatra bhi
 Both 'solar time' and 'constellation time' are based on the regularity of rotation speed on the Earth's own polar axis
 samay kaa gyaan surya kii drishy sthitiyon se kiya jaataa he
 Generally, the day is from sunrise to sunset and night from sunset to sunrise again, but the day for tithinna is called night by day
 kisi sthaan par surya dwaara yamyottar vrutt ke adhobindu kii ek parikrama ko ek 'drishy din' kehete hai, tathaa surya kii kisi sthir nakshatra ke saapeksh ek parikrama ko 'nakshatra din' kehete hai
 According to this constellation convention, the initial point of measurement, that is, the spring coincident point of the ecliptic and equatorial circle is taken
 yadhyapi nakshatra din sthir he, tathaapi yah hamaare vyavhaar ke liye upyogi nahin he, kyonki yah drishy din se 3 minute 53 second kam he
 The value of visible day is not always the same
 at: kisi ghadi se drishy surya ke samay kaa bataaya janaa kathin he
 There are two reasons for this: one, the apparent motion of the Sun is not always the same, the other is that the apparent Sun is seen moving in the eclipse
 hamen samaysoochak yantra banane ke liye aise surya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo madhyam gati se sadaa vishuvatvrutt main chale
 Such astrologers call astrology astrology-mean-sun or simply mean sun
 vishuvatvrutt ke madhyam surya tathaa krantivrutt ke madhyam surya ke antar ko bhaskaracharya ne udayantar tathaa krantivrittiya madhyam surya tathaa spasht surya ke antar ko bhujaantar kaha he
 If the astrology-mean Sun performs Udayantar and Bhujantar rites, then that scene will become Surya
 aadhunik shabdaawalee main udayantar tathaa bhujaantar ke ek saath sanskaar ko samay sameekaran kehete hai
 This is similar to the difference between the time of our clocks and the time of visible sun
 samay samikar kaa prati din kaa maatr ganit dwaara nikaala ja saktaa he
 In the Sailor Almanac published today, its daily value is given
 is prakaar ham apni ghadiyon se jab chahen drishy surya kaa samay gyaat kar sakate hai
 It is used a lot in astrology
 vilomat: ham surya ke urdhv yamyottar bindu ke langhan kaa vedh karke, usamen samay samikar ko jod yaa ghataakar, vaastavik madhya-surya kaa samay gyaat karke apni ghadiyon ke samay ko thik kar sakate hai
 We told modern watches to measure time, then it was found that due to cold and heat these watches do not give proper time due to shrinking and spreading of metal parts
 ab hamaare saamne yah samasya thi ki ham apni yantric ghadiyon kii sookshm ashuddhiyon ko kaise jaane? yadhyapi surya ke urdhv yamyottar langhan kii vidhi se ham apni ghadiyon kii ashuddhi jaan sakate the, tathaapi surya ke urdhv yamyottar langhan kaa vedh swayan kuch vilsht hai tathaa surya ke bimb ke vishaal hone ke kaaran usamen vedhakarta kii vyaktigat truti kii adhik sambhaavna he
 The second difficulty was that the time of our mean-sun-clock had no direct relation with the position of the celestial bodies
 isi kami kii purti ke liye nakshatra ghadi kaa nirmaan kiya gaya, jo nakshatra samay bataati thi
 Its 24 hours are equivalent to the time of one orbit of the Earth's own axis, or one orbit of the posterior point of the spring point
 21 march ke lagbhag, basantpaat bindu hamaare drishy-surya ke saath urdhv yamyottar langhan karata he
 At that time the time of the sidereal clock is zero hour, zero minute, zero second
 hamaari ghadiyon main us samay 12 bajte hai
 In the afternoon on the second day, the time for the sidereal clock will be 4 minutes
 anya kisi bhi nichit din madhya-surya ke samay ko ham anupaat se nakshatra sam main, yaa nakshatra samay ko madhya surya ke samay main, parivartit kar sakate hai
 Sailor almanacs have tables of this type of time conversion
 is prakaar yadi hamen kisi prakaar shuddh samay denevaali nakshatra ghadi mil jaae, te hamen apni madhya ghadi ke samay ko shuddh rakh sakate hai
 Although the sidereal clock is also mechanical and it also undergoes mechanical error, it can be purified daily, as it has direct relation to the position of celestial bodies
 vah is prakaar he : koi grah va tara urdhv yamyottar bindu se pachim kii ore khagoleey dhruv par jo kone banaata he, use kalkon kehete hai
 Thus, the constellation is the spring of some spring
 kisi tara vaa grah kaa vishuvaansh basantpaat se uski vishuvatvritiya duuri dwaara surya athwa taron kaa vedh karke, kronometer naamak yantra kii sahaayta se, unke yamyottar langhan kaa nakshatra samay jaan liya jaataa he
 Combined with the sidereal clock, the constellation time of the planetary or star piercing in the telescope of the post-mortem device is determined by pressing the chronometer switch
 is samay se yantric ashuddhiyon ko nikaal dene par jo samay praapt hota he, vahi grah yaa taare ke yamyottar ke urdhv bindu ke langhan kaa samay hota he
 If the sidereal is right, it will be equal to the equinox of the planet or star and the difference is inaccuracy of the clock
 is prakaar nakshatra ghadi ko shuddh rakhkar usase madhya surya ghadiyon ko shuddh kiya jaataa he
 There is a greater possibility of personal inaccuracy in perforation by post-mortem instrument
 isliye taron ke yamyottar langhan ke nakshatra samay ko camera lage khamadhya doordarshkon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Thus even though the mean time clocks are maintained properly, daily modifications to them were a problem
 isliye aajkal ghadiyon ke second suchak upkaran quartz ke crystalon se banaae jate hai
 Thermal effects on quartz crystals have little effect
 atev ye ghadiyaan bahut shuddh samay detii hai
 The inaccuracy of up to a thousandth of a second can be known
 saath is ghadi ko us tarah kii duusare steshnon par rakhi ghadiyon ke samay sanketak, pip, ko sunakar, milaayaa ja saktaa he tathaa isse samay sanketak pip bheje bhi ja sakate hai
 a watch of this type was proposed in 1953 for the proposed Sanskrit Kalaj Observatory of Kashi, which is now in Nainital
 is prakaar kii ghadiyon se desh kii mukhya ghadiyon ko thik karke, radio ke samay sakentak "pip" se sab madhya suryan ghadiyaan thik rakhi jaati hai
 Nowadays, in every country, considering the time of midnight as zero, it is considered the beginning of the day from there
 din raat ke 24 ghanton ko do 12 ghanton main, raat ke baarah baje se 12 ghanton tak purvahnkaal tak tathaa din ke 12 baje se raatri ke 12 baje tak aparahnkaal main, baant diya jaataa he
 Our clocks tell this time right here
 in 24 ghanton ko naagarik din kehete hai
 There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in 1 hour and 60 seconds in one minute
 vigyaan kii angreji maapan pranali foot second main tathaa antarrashtriya pranali centimetre gram second main second hi samay kii ikai he
 a brown dwarf or brown dwarf universe is said to contain an object that holds the position between the gas demons and stars in shape
 bhure boune gas ke bane hote hai, jisamen hydrogen or hilium pradhan hoti hai
 Brown dwarfs are smaller than stars and do not have enough gravity to begin the process of nuclear fusion by crushing atoms of hydrogen gas, but some other heavy elements begin to coalesce - such as deuterium and lithium
 Of gas daanav grahon main bilkul kisi prakaar kaa sanyalan nahin hota
 There is some dispute among scientists that on which shape Vastu gas does not remain a monster and becomes brown dwarf and on which shape it becomes a star
 anumaan he ke brihaspati se 13 guna zyaada dravyaman hone par bhura bouna or 75 guna zyaada dravyaman hone par tara ban jaataa he
 Stars are also made of gas like gas demons, but the stars are so large that the atoms of the hydrogen gas in them start to form helium through the process of nuclear fusion by the pressure of gravity
 is sanyalan main bahut urja or prakaash paidaa hota he or yahi taron se nikalne vaali roshni kaa strot he
 Brown dwarfs do not have this much pressure, but the combination of other elements in them is believed to be a slow brown light
 isliye unhen bhura bouna kaha jaataa he

 Maitreya, Mettayya, or Maithri, is the future Buddha according to Buddhist beliefs
 katipay buddha granthon, jaise amitabh sutara or saddharmpundaree sutara main inkaa naam ajit bhi varnit he
 According to Buddhist traditions, Maitreya is a Bodhisattva who will incarnate on earth and attain enlightenment and teach pure religion
 granthon ke anusaar, maitrey vartmaan buddha, gautam buddha ke uttaradhikari honge
 Maitreya's arrival predicts his arrival at a time when the people of the earth must have forgotten religion

 The word "maitreya" derives from Sanskrit "friend" or "friendship"

 Most parts of the Pali branch are found in the form of a question-answer, however, this Sutta is found in completely different contexts, while talking to the disciples
 isi kaaran katipay vidwaanon kaa mat he ki yah baad main joda hua athwa kuch parivartit kiya hua ho saktaa he
 In northern India, Maitreya has been depicted as a popular subject in greek-buddhist Gandhara art, which was at its height around the first century
 gautam buddha ke saath maitrey kaa chithran vividh roopon main hua he or in kalakritiyon main gautam or maitrey main bhinnata kaa nirupan ek pramukh vishay rahaa he
 Gautam Buddha and Maitreya Buddha are synonymous with each other in China from the fourth to the sixth century, although the Chinese representation of these two has not yet been fully analyzed and reviewed
 maitrey buddha ke nirupan kaa ek udhaaharan kingjhau se praapt hua he jiskaa kaal 529 isvi nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 It is believed that Maitreya's religious reputation took place around the same time as Amitabh's reputation, around the third century
 aamtaur par maitrey buddha ko baithi hui avasthaa main nirupit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 He is represented as sitting on the throne, either with his feet on the earth or with one foot bent over the other, sitting on the other foot
 ek bodhisattva ke rup main inhen sidhaa khadaa rahane kii mudra main or aabhushanon se susajjit pradarshit kiya janaa chahie
 But it is seen only in a few Gandhara art sculptures where they are depicted standing
 nirupanon main inhen sar par stupakar mukut dhaaran kiye hue dikhaaya jaataa he
 This stupa is believed to represent the relics of Gautama Buddha by whom Maitreya would prove the identity of his successor and reclaim the Dharmachakra placed on the white lotus
 greek-buddha kala main unhen apane baayen haath main kumbh dhaaran kiye hue bhi pradarshit kiya gaya he
 The Tibetan tradition also sees it as the enlightenment
 kuch jagahon par, unke donon ore asang or vasubandhu ko nirupit kiya gaya he
 In the Buddhist tradition it is believed that Maitreya currently resides in a heaven called Tushit and is looking forward to the time of his revelation
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki gautam buddha bhi apane janm se pehle is swarg main nivas kar chuke hai
 All Bodhisattvas reside in this heaven before their descent on earth
 haalaanki, buddha dharm kii hinayan or mahayan shakhaon main bodhisattva kii sankalpana alag-alag he

 jisase mithila kaa prayek vyakti apane aapako urjawan evam tejasvi anubhav karte hai

 The 62nd passage of Manusmriti, which introduces the Devalaya sub in the Mithila pilgrimage section, clearly mentions that Kapilmuni's ashram is a typical Shivalinga named Videshvarnath in the cremation area of lohini Devi, five places of fire from Kapileshwar place

 Peter Drucker has a view in this regard that whatever the manager does, it is by decisions
 ham jaanate hai ki prashaskon ko din–pratidin anek kaary karne padate hai or in kaaryon ko karne ke liye unke paas anek vikalp hote hai, in vikalpon main se sarvonttam vikalp koun sa he, iskaa nirdhaaran karnaa 'nirnay' lenaa he
 Terry has said in this regard that 'life is the decision-making of administrators
 terry ke shabdon main yadi prashaasak kii koi saarvbhaumik pahchaan he, to vah he uskaa nirnay lenaa
 Administrators have to take their decision management tasks only under planned organization, direction, control, etc
 duusare shabdon main, ham kah sakate hai ki nirnayan prabandh prakriya main sarvavyaapak he
 Simon's view that decision-making is administration, seems to be quite appropriate
 simon ke shabdon main ham sahamat ho yaa na ho parantu yah nirvivaad satya he ki nirnay hi prashasan kaa hriday he
 Decisions in administration are the result of certain processes
 nirnay prakriya kii teen visheshtaayen hoti hai – Since decision making is a process and takes place at a time, the surroundings and the events that occur simultaneously will affect the outcome
 nirnayan kaa shabdic arth antim parinaam tak pahunchne se lagaaya jaataa he, jabaki vyaavhaarik drushtikon se iskaa aashay nishkarsh par pahunchne se he

 According to Glover, the decision regarding one of the chosen options is the decision
 re 
re 
 kilions ke anusaar, nirnayan vibhinn vikalpon ke chunaav kii ek saralatam vidhi he
 George r
 In Terry's words, a decision is a choice of two or more possible alternatives based on a single criterion
 mekafarland ke anusaar, nirnay lenaa chayan kii ek kriya he, jiske antargat koi adhishashi di hui paristhitiyon main is nirnay par pahunchataa he ki kya kiya janaa chahie
 a decision represents a behavior that is selected from several possible choices
 ji

 shekel ke anusaar, nirnay lenaa rachanaatmak maansik kriya kaa vah kendra bindu he, jahaan kaary purti ke liye gyaan, vichaar, bhaavana tathaa kalpana kaa sanyog hota he
 According to Ernest Dale, administrative decisions mean decisions that are always taken in the course of correct administrative actions, such as - planning, organization, recruitment, direction, control, innovation and representation of employees
 lundvarg ke shabdon main, prashaskeey nirnay ek prakriya he jisamen ki ek vyakti sanghathan main duusare vyaktiyon ke vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne ke liye ek nirnay karata he, taaki ve vyakti sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne main apana yogadan de sake
 Thus it is clear that decision-making refers to selecting the best option from the available options to achieve the stated goal
 ek vishesh paristhiti main kaary kiya jaave, iskaa nirdhaaran nirnay lene waalon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The administrator has more than one option when making decisions
 nirnay karnaa anek uplabdh vikalpon main se jaagruk chayan karnaa he
 Decisions are often expressed in the form of policy, rule, order or instruction
 at: saamanyat: nirnay kaaphi jatil or kathin hote hai, balki kai nirnay aise bhi hote hai, jinamein vichaar vimarsh karnaa adhik jaruri hota he
 In short, it can be said that out of the many options available under the most complex and intertwined circumstances, choosing the best option and giving it the form of work in an effective manner is called 'decision'
 
 upurkt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par nirnayan ke nimnaankit lakshan kehete ja sakate hai – Herbert Simon has described three levels of decision-making - peter epa
 drukar ne nirnay prakriya ke nimna charan batalaaye hai – Newman, Summer, and Warren have described the following four stages of the decision process - baike ne nirnay prakriya ke nimna 11 charan batalaaye hai – After studying the appropriate stages of the decision process, it can be said that a decision process may consist of the following steps - nirnay prakriya ke pratham str main kisi ek samasya ko vyavasthit dhang se su lajhane ke liye uske uddeshyon ko jaananaa va samajhnaa bahu t aavashyak he
 These objectives should be such that individual and institutional objectives can be coordinated
 che ster ai
 barnard is sambandh main yah kehete hai ki samasya kii vyakhya karne se purv uske kisi samalochak tatv ko gyaat kar lenaa chahie kyonki samalochak tatv hi nirnayan kaa kendra bindu hota he
 This is the point where the election is made
 he ns tathaa mesi ke anusaar, samasya kii vyakhya main samalochak tatv pramu kha hota he
 Many officials even say that it is more difficult to explain the problem than its solution
 at: samasya kii vyakhyasaavdhaneepurvak kii jaani chahie
 After clear explanation and definition of the problem, the next step of the decision making process is to analyze the problem
 yadi samasya badi he to usko kai bhaagon main vibhakt kar liya jaataa he tathaa uske prayek bhaag kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 The relevant facts should be collected for analysis
 samasya kii spasht vyakhya tathaa vishleshan karne ke baad nirnayakarta vibhinn soochnaaon tathaa tathyon ke aadhaar par vibhinn vaikalpik samaadhaanon kaa vikaas karata he
 Developing alternative solutions is an important stage of the decision making process
 at: prashaskon main yah yogyata honi chahie ki ve vaikalpik samaadhaanon kaa vikaas kar saken
 After developing various alternative solutions, evaluating these options with a view to deciding them is the next stage of the decision making process
 in vikalpon kaa moolyankan nimna baton ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya janaa chahie– After evaluating the various options, the next stage of the decision making process is to choose the best option from one of those options
 prashaskon ke anubhav, anusandhan evam vishle shan ityadi vikalpon ke chunaav ke aadhaar ho sakate hai
 The administrator is influenced by many things before making the final decision
 isamen uskaa anubhav mahatvapurn he
 The administrative experience of administrators plays an important role in taking decisions
 lekin anubhav ke aadhaar par hi sadai va nirnay nahin liye ja sakate
 For this, administrators should examine the reality of the effects of decisions by organizations and the perceived circumstances
 chayan kii anusandhan tathaa vishle shan vidhiyaan bhi bahut adhik pra bhaavshaalee vidhiyaan maani jaati hai
 When a decision is taken to solve a problem, the next step is to give it a function
 prashaasak ko is prakaar ke prayaas karne chahie ki chuni hui kaarividhi sucharu rup se lagu kii ja sake
 The consent of the people to whom the decision is being implemented should also be taken in relation to that decision
 jab kisi nirnay ko kaaryrup pradaan kiya jaataa he, to prashaasak ko chahie ki vah us nirnay ke prabhaavon kaa mu lyankan kare tathaa unke sambandh main sabhi aavashyak soochnaaon ko ekatrit karen
 At the same time, the administrator should also establish control over the actions that are being taken to make the decision functional
 nirnay prakriya ke uparokt sabhi str par ek adarsh nirnay prakriya ke str kahe ja sakate hai, uparokt str hamako is baat se avgat karaate hai ki nirnay le ne ke liye kya–kya kriyaayein kii ja sakati hai
 These levels can also be reduced or increased according to the nature of the decision

 vidhyalay ke bare main saamaanya jaankaree is prakaar he:- Harivansh festival is the last festival of Mahabharata, it is also known as 'harivanshpuran'
 harivanshpurana main teen parv tathaa 318 adhyay hai
 According to the Sarvapratisarga of Purana Panchalakshan in the future of Harivanshpurana, the origin of the universe, the form of Brahm, incarnation calculation and Samkhya and Yoga have been considered
 smritisamagree tathaa sampradayik vichaardhaaraen bhi is parv main adhikansh rup main milti hai
 For this reason, this festival is known from Harivanshaparva and Vishnuparva
 vishnuparv main nrity or abhinayasambandhi saamagree apane moulik rup main milti he
 Bhalikya is mentioned in two places under this festival
 chhaaliky vaadyasangitamay nrity gyaat hota he
 The performance of Hav Bhava occupies an important place in this dance
 chhaaliky ke sambandh main anya puraana koi bhi prakaash nahin daalate
 On the occasion of Vasudeva's Ashvamegh Yajna in Vishnuparva, a nut named Bhadra is described to appease the sages with his act
 isi nat ke saath pradhyumna, samb aadi vajranabhapur main jaakar apane kushal abhinay se vahaan daityon kaa manoranjan karte hai
 Here the purpose called "ramayana" and the performance of the episode "kaubera Rambhabhisar" are described in detail

 Hajra has given the fourth century Purana to Harivansh on the basis of Raas
 vishnupurana or bhagwatpurana kaa kaal haajra ne kramash: paanchavin shatabdi tathaa chhathi shatabdi ke lagbhag nishchit kiya he
 According to Mr
 Dixit, the period of Matsya Purana is the third century
 krishnacharitra, raji kaa vrittant tathaa anya vrittanton se tulana karne par harivansh in puraanon se purvavarti nishchit hota he
 Therefore Vishnuparva and Bhavishparva of Harivamsa should be considered as the third century
 harivansh ke antargat harivanshaparv style or vrittanton kii drushti se vishnuparv or bhavishyaparv se pracheen gyaat hota he
 In the Ashwaghochata Vajra list, there are some verses literally resembling Harivamsa
 paashchaatya vidvan vaibar ne vajrasuchee ko harivansh kaa rini mana he or re choudhary ne unke mat kaa samarthan kiya
 The period of Ashwaghosh is almost second century
 yadi ashwaghosh kaa kaal dwitiya shatabdi he to harivanshaparv kaa kaal prakshipt sthalon ko chhodkar dwitiya shatabdi se kuch pehle samajhnaa chahie
 Poetry in Harivansh has its own characteristic like other ancient Puranas
 rasaparipaak or bhaavon kii samuchit abhivyakti main yah puraana kabhi kabhi utkrisht kaavyon se samanta rakhata he
 The allegorical passages reveal the talent and imagination of the mythological poet
