 There are different types of children in a class which may have their own requirements
 jaise - kuch bachche aksharon ko ulta likhte hai, kuch kii shravan shakti kam hoti hai, kuch mand buddhi vaale hote hai
 Not all children can learn at normal speed

 The Ritas in ancient Vedic religion rightly call the principle of eternal natural order and equilibrium, that is, the elements that place or bring the whole world and the universe into a religious position

 His large military corps always used to roam, so it is also called 'd-pangu'
 iskaa gungan prithviraj raso main bhi hua he
 Rajashekhar Suri has stated in his management book that Kashiraj Jayachandra was the conqueror and ganga-yamuna Doab was his specially occupied territory
 nayanchandra ne rambhamanjari main jayachand ko yawanon kaa naash karne vaala kaha he
 Being warlike, he increased his military power in such a way that it became unique, by which Jayachand came to be known as 'pangu'

 jayachand ne sindhu nadi par musalamaanon se aisa ghor sangram kiya ki rakt ke pravaah se nadi kaa nil jal ekadam aisa laal hua maanon amavasya kii raatri main usha kaa arunoday ho gaya ho 
 Yavaneshwar Sahabuddin Gauri was defeated several times in the battle by Jayachandra
 rambhamanjari main bhi kaha gaya he ki jayachandra ne yawanon kaa naash kiya
 He had a large kingdom in North India
 usne anhilwara ke shaasha siddhraj ko haraaya tha
 It extended its state border from north to south along the banks of the Narmada
 purv main bengal ke lakshmanasen ke rajya ko chooti thi
 Prithviraj Chauhan was defeated by Gauri in the battle of Tarain
 iske parinaam swaroop dilli or ajmer par musalamaanon kaa aadhipaty ho gaya tha
 Gauri handed over the administration here to his chief commander Aibak and went to his own country
 tarain ke yuddh ke baad bharat main musalamaanon kaa sthaayee rajya bana
 Aibak became the representative of Gauri and started ruling from here
 is yuddh ke do varsh baad gauri dubaara vishaal sena lekar bharat ko jeetne ke liye aayaa
 This time he intended to win Kannauj
 kannauj us samay sampann rajya tha
 Gauri carried out this attack with the intention of securing his conquered territory in North India
 vah jaanata tha ki bina shaktishaalee kannauj rajya ko adheen kiye bharat main uski satta kaayam na rah sakegi
 Two years after the Battle of Tarain, Qutbuddin Aibak marched on Jaichand
 sultan shahabuddin raste main pachaas hajaar sena ke saath aa mila
 On receiving the information about the Muslim invasion, Jaichand also came to the battlefield with his army
 donon ke bich itawa ke paas ‘chandaavar naamak sthaan par muqabla hua
 In the war, King Jayachand sat on an elephant and started operating the army
 is yuddh main jayachand kii puri sena nahin thi
 There were armies in different areas, Jaichand had a small army at that time
 durbhaagya se jayachand ke ek tir laga, jisase unka praanant ho gaya, yuddh main gauri kii vijay hui
 This war took place on 1250 AD
 jayachand par deshadrohi kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 It is said that he called Gauri to India to attack Prithviraj and also gave him military support
 vastut: ye aarope niraadhaar hai
 There is no evidence to suggest that Jaichand assisted Gauri
 gauri ko bulaane vaale desh drohi to duusare hi the, jinke naam prithviraj raso main ankit hai
 The main feudal work of Prithviraj came in the Sanyogita episode
 in logon ne gupt rup se gauri ko samachar diya ki prithviraj ke pramukh samant ab nahin rahe, yahi mauka he
 Even then Gauri did not believe, she sent her messengers to Delhi in disguise of fakirs
 ye log inhen logon ke paas gupt rup se rahe the
 He went and informed Gauri, when Gauri attacked Prithviraj
 gauri ko bhed dene vaale the nityanand khatri, pratapsingh jain, madhobhatta tathaa dharmayan kysth jo tenwaron ke kavi or adhikari the 
 There is no mention of Jaichand anywhere in contemporary history that he helped Gauri
 yah sab aadhunik itihaas main kapol kalpit baaten hai
 Jaichand had no disharmony with Prithviraj
 sanyogita prakaran se jarur vah thodaa kupit hua tha
 At that time Prithviraj was saved only by the grace of Jayachand
 sanyogita haran ke samay jayachand ne apni sena ko ajna di thi ki inako gher liya jaae
 He kept pressing Prithviraj for five consecutive days
 prithviraj ke pramukhpramukh samant yuddh main kaam aa gaye the
 On the fifth day, the army encircled and hardened
 jayachand aage badha vah dekhtaa he ki prithviraj ke peeche ghode par sanyogita baithi he
 He considered that Sanyogita had chosen Prithviraj
 agar main ise maar detaa hoon to bada anarth hoga, beti vidhwaa ho jaaegi
 He ordered the army to break the cordon, then Prithviraj reached Delhi
 phir jayachand ne apane purohit dilli bheje, jahaan vidhi-vidhaan se prithviraj or sanyogita kaa vivaah sampann hua
 Jayachand was neutral in the war between Prithviraj and Gauri
 is yuddh main prithviraj ne usase sahaayta bhi nahin maangi thi
 The first war also did not ask for help
 agar prithviraj sahaayta maangata to jayachand sahaayta jarur kar saktaa tha
 If Jaichand and Gauri had friendship then why would Gauri attack Jaichand later? Therefore, this allegation is false
 prithviraj raso main yah baat kahin nahin kahi gai ki jayachand ne gauri ko bulaayaa tha
 Similarly, in contemporary Persian texts, there is not even an indication that Jaichand invited Gauri
 yah ek suni-sunai baat he jo ek rudhi ban gai he
 Jaichand and historian Historians are said to be abusive in the absence of sufficient knowledge of history for Emperor Jaichand while the opinion of eminent historians towards Emperor Jaichand is as follows
 is kathan main koi satyata nahin he ki maharaj jayachand ne prithviraj par akraman karne ke liye mohammad gauri ko aamantrit kiya ho
 - Dr
 RC Existent yah baat aadharahin he ki maharaj jayachand ne mohammadgauri ko prithviraj par akraman karne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 - J
C
 Powal jayachand par yah aarope galat he
 Contemporary Muslim historians are completely silent on the fact that Jaychand sent such an invitation

 ramshankar treepathi The notion that Jayachand invited Muslims to ascend Prithviraj is unfounded
 us samay ke katipay granth prapya hai kintu kisi main bhi is baat kaa ullekh nahin he
 There is no such mention in the description of Prithviraj Vijay, Hamir epic, Rambha Manjari, Pramukh Kosh and any Muslim traveler
 itihaas is baat kaa sakshi he ki jayachand ne chandaavar main mohammad gauri se shaury purna yuddh kiya tha
 | - Mahendra Nath Mishra yah baat nitant asaty he ki jayachand ne shahbuddin ko prithviraj par akraman karne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Shahabdin was well aware that till the superpower Jaichand was defeated in North India, the authority over the territories of Delhi and Ajmer etc
 would not be permanent because Jaichand's ancestors and Jayachand himself had defeated the Turko many times
 - ebn naseer In the historical book titled Early History of India, it is not mentioned by the historian Smith
 yah vishwaas ki gauri ko jayachand ne prithviraj ke viruddh nimantran diya tha, thik nahin jaan padataa kyonki musalmaan lekhakon ne kahin bhi iskaa zikr nahin kiya he

 Induction of immunity Artificial induction of immunity for specific diseases - makes people immune to them rather than waiting to catch them
 iskaa prayojan mrityu or peedit ke jokhim ko kam karne ke liye he
 Critical illness can cause infection against immunization, which is generally beneficial
 pashchar ke rogaanu siddhant ke samarthan ke baad, hamane junglee sankraman se jude jokhim ko rokane ke liye teji se rogakshmata ko prerit kiya he
 It is hoped that further understanding of the molecular basis of immunity will translate to improved clinical practice in the future
 yah lekh mukhya vishyon main se prayek aitihaasik or taarkik anukram kaa vistrut lekh detaa he
 See main article variolation and smallpox
 sab se pehle maanav main rogakshmata kii kritrim preran darj kii gai thi variolation yaa tikaakaran ke dwaara, jo kam ghaatak chechak ke sankraman ke niyantran se kiya jaataa tha, jo use uske adhik ghaatak prakritik rup sheetala major se rogakshmata detaa he
 It was practiced in ancient times in India and China and imported into Europe, via Turkey, around 1720 by Lady Montagu and perhaps others
 england se takanic coloniyon main teji se fail gaya or boston main bhi failaa pahunchane africa das ke dwaara
 The disadvantage of variolation is that the inoculating agent was still an active form of smallpox and, although less potent, could still kill the inoculee and spread the pass to others in its full form
 haalanki, chechak miner ke tikaakaran se maut kaa khatra 1% se 2% tha, chechak ke prakritik rup se maut kaa 20% jokhim ke muqaabale, tikaakaran kaa jokhim aam taur par sweekaarya mana jaataa tha
 View the main article by Edward Genertification and Edward Jenner 1796 main, edward jennar, jo ek doctor or vaigyanik jo variolation kaa abhyaas karte the, unhone ek pareekshan kiya is lok aadhaar par ki gosheetla ke sankraman se maamuli rog ke lakshan the, ghaatak kabhi nahin tha or chechak se unmukti bhi sammanit hui
 jennar ne ek rogi ke ghaav se saamagree duusare rogi ko sthanantarit kiya, is prakaar duusare rogi ko gosheetla se sankraman kiya
 He then demonstrated that there was immunity against smallpox by exposing
 is siddhant kaa pradarshan kuch saal pehle binyamin Jesty ne kiya tha, lekin uskaa prachaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 Jenner described and generalized the process and then reproduced in Goshitala's therapeutics and is credited with the discovery
 tikaakaran ne variolation se padbhaar sambhaal liya
 Jenner was, in those days, an empiricist like the members of the Royal Society
 tikaakaran ke siddhant main aage pragati karne kaa samarthan baad aayaa tha
 See the main article Louis Pasteur and the germ theory
 lui pashchar ne siddh prayogon sahaj swaabhaavik vyutpann ke lokapriy siddhant ko galat sabit kiya or aadhunik rogaanu siddhant kaa praapt kiya
 Based on the theory that specific infectious diseases cause microorganisms, Pasteur isolated the anthrax agent
 iske baad unhone sankramak agent ke hanirahit parivartan se tikaa vyutpann kiya or phir is niskriy rup main sankramak agenton ko khet ke jaanwaron ko diya, jo rog se pratiraksh sabit hue
 Pasteur prepared a different crude for the rabies infectious agent
 In a brave drug development, he probably saved the life of a person who was bitten by a crazy frantic dog and that patient was inoculated from inactive rabies preparations
 or is tarah jo rogi marane ke liye vaanchit tha, vah pehla safaltaapurvak rebies ke khilaaf tikaa lagaaya vyakti tha
 Now known, anthrax is caused by a bacterium and rabies is caused by a virus
 us samay ke microscope se bacteria ko yathochit dikhaa sakane kii ummid thi, lekin virus ke imaging ko 20 veen sadi main hal, adhik se adhik lens kshamta ke electron microscope ke vikaas karne ke liye pratiksha karnaa padaa
 Some diseases, such as tetanus, are not caused by bacterial growth but by the production of bacterial toxin
 tetanus vish itnaa ghaatak he, ki manushya vyakti prakritik sankraman se pratiraksha nahin kar sakate, kyonki ek vyakti ko maarane ke liye raashi or samay kii aavashyaktaa, pratiraksha pranali ko vish ko pahchaanane main or vish ke khilaaf pratipind kaa utpaadan karne kii tulana, main bahut kam he
 Although tetanus toxin is easily deformed, causing it to lose its ability to produce disease, tetanus injection is capable of producing immunity
 vikrut vish toxoid kaha jaataa he

 By using simple molecules such as toxoids for vaccination, the immune system produces a lower immune response and less immune memory
 haalanki, kuch padaarthon ko mishran main jodakar, udhaaharan ke liye, tetanus toxoid ko fitkiri par sokhna, pratiraksha pratikriya ko badhaata he
 These substances are known as enhancers
 kai alag alag gunavardhak aushadhi tikaa taiyaar karne main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The enhancer drug has been used in immune system research
 adhik saral pratijnak anuon ke liye "pratiraksha badhaane" kaa ek or samakaleen drushtikon he pratijan ko sanyugma karnaa he
 Conjugation is the antigen's attachment to another substance that also produces an immune response, thus increasing the overall response and producing a more robust immune memory for the antigen
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek toxoid ko lobaar nimonia ke liye adhikansh jimmedaar bacteria ke capsule ke policecorids se sanlagn kiya ja saktaa he
 See also immunoglobulin
 vishisht sankraman se asthaayee pratiraksha unmukti karne ke liye, ek vishisht immunoglobulin yaa antibody ke rup main baahar anu kaa utpaadan kiya ja saktaa he
 It was performed previously, after separating the serum fraction from the blood of an already immunized person, injecting this serum to the person for whom immunity is desired
 ise niskriy rogakshmata kaha jaataa he or yah serum jo ek vyakti se anya main injection ke rup main diya jaataa he, use kabhi kabhi serumrodhi kaha jaataa he
 Antitumor from other mammals, especially horses, has often been used to save life and results in life, usually in humans, but there is also the risk of severe sensory reaction from shock and death, as some human bodies sometimes have antibodies from other animals Identifies as a foreign protein
 niskriy rogakshmata asthaayee he, kyonki sthanantarit kar rahe antibody kaa jivan keval 3-6 maheene he
 Every placental mammal has experienced immunity, by corresponding antibody transfer across its mother's placenta, which has led to her passive immunity - something that her mother was immune to inactivated immunity
 yah yuva ke liye kuch sangrakshan kii anumati detaa he, jabaki uskaa apana pratiraksha pranali viksit kar rahaa he
 Synthetic human immunoglobulin can be made for many reasons, including and is often more and more likely to be used
 haalanki, ve nirmaan karne ke liye mahange hai or 2006 main bade paimaane par utpaadan ke rup main nahin hai
 In the future it may be that the antibodies are artificially designed to fit specific antigens, then produce them in large quantities, causing temporary immunity in people, before a particular pathogen is exposed, such as a bacterium, a virus, or Prion
 Currently, science is available to understand this process, this technique is not available to perform

 Those who look from a distance feel that the speed of that object falling towards the black hole is slowing down and the redness in its image is increasing

 But that object does not feel any such effect - it feels that it quickly falls towards the black hole and crosses the event horizon

 39 Psychology is the latest discipline of the modern era
 vaise to manovigyaan kii shuruuaat aaj se 2,000 varsh purv yunaan main hui
 We see him in the writings of Plato and Aristotle
 madhyakaal main manovigyaan chintan kii yorape main kami ho gai thi
 It began in the modern era in the eighteenth century BCE
 parantu us samay manovigyaan keval darshanashastron kaa sahyogi tha
 He had no independent existence
 manovigyaan kaa swatantra astitv 19 veen shatabdi main hua, parantu is samay bhi vidwaanon ko manushya ke chetan man kaa hi gyaan tha
 He had no knowledge of his unconscious mind
 jab achetan man kii khoj hui to pataa chalaa ki jo gyaan man ke vishay main tha vah uske kshudra bhaag kaa hi tha
 The discovery of modern psychology is the result of activists of medical science
 in khojon kii shuruyaat dow frid ne kii
 His disciples Alfred Adler Charles Yug William William and Frankji carried it forward
 dow frid swayan prarambh main shaareerik rogon ke chikitsak the
 Some patients came to him, whose disease did not go away despite all types of physical therapy
 aise kuch jatil rogiyon kaa upachaar dow broar ne keval pratidin baatcheet karke tathaa rogi kii vyathaa ko prati din sunakar kiya
 This experience of Dr
 Brewer showed that many physical and mental diseases of humans also occur due to suppression of some kind of strong emotions, and when these feelings are gradually published
 If it is, then it also ends
 dow frid kii pramukh dein damit bhaawanaaon kii khoj kii hi he
 Searching for them, he came to know that Munsya had many parts of his mind
 saadharantaya jis bhaag ko vah jaanata he, vah uskaa chetan man hi he
 Beyond this mind is the part of the mind where the knowledge of man is stored which he gathers with great diligence
 is bhaag main aisi icchaayen bhi upasthit rahati hai jo vartmaan main kaarynvit nahin ho rahi hotin, parantu jinhen vyakti ne barabas dabaa diya he
 This part of the mind is called the subconscious mind
 iske pare manushya kaa achetan man he
 In this part of the mind, there are such desires, aspirations, memories and emotions of the municipality, which he has to suppress and forget
 ye damit bhav tathaa icchaayen vyakti ke achetan man main sangathit ho jaati hai or phir ve uske vyaktitv main khinchaav or sangharsh kii sthiti utpann kar detii hai
 This type of repressed emotions, desires and memories are called mental glands
 maansik rogi ke man main aisi ane prabal granthiyaan rahati hai inkaa rogi ko swayan gyaan nahin rahata or unki sweekruti bhi vah karnaa nahin chahta
 Such suppressed glands are involved in many types of mental and physical diseases
 histyria kaa rog unheen main se ek hai
 This disease sometimes manifests as physical disease, then it is called metamorphic hysteria
 manushya ke achetan man main na keval damit avaanchhneeya or aniatik bhav rahete hai, varan unhen daman karanevaali naitik dharanaayen bhi rahati hai
 Because of the lack of knowledge of the person's conscious mind, one cannot easily change them
 manushya ke suswatv or uske achetan man main upasthit vaasanamak, asaamaajik bhaavon or ichchhaaon kaa sangharsh munashya ke anjaane hi hota he
 The beauty of a man is similar to that of a dog, which does not allow antisocial thoughts and desires in the unconscious mind of man to come to the level of consciousness
 phir ye damit bhav apana rup badalakar manushya kii jaagrath avasthaa main athwa uski swapnavastha main, jabaki uskaa suswatv kuch dhilaa ho jaataa he, rup badalakar prakashit hote hai
 These expressions are changed in many forms and are published in physical diseases or defects of conduct
 dow frid ne swapn ke liye nayaa vigyaan hi khadaa kar diya
 According to his statement, dreams are the result of the actions of repressed emotions present in the unconscious mind
 kisi vyakti ke swapn ko jaanakar or uskaa thik arth lagaakar ham uske damit bhaavon ko jaan sakate hai or uske maansik vibhaajan ko samaapt karne main uski sahaayta kar sakate hai
 The discovery of modern psychology has gone beyond the above discoveries of Dr
 Freud
 unke shishy dow yung ne bataaya ki manushya ke suswatv kii jad keval uske vyaktigat anubhav main nahin he, varan yah sampurna manavsamaj ke anubhav main he
 For this reason, when a man behaves against the beliefs of society, then fear of punishment arises in his inner mind without reason
 yah bhay tab tak nahin jaataa jab tak manushya apni naitikta sambandhi bhul sweekaar nahin kar letaa or uskaa praayshchit nahin kar daalata
 With this kind of self-acceptance and atonement, unity is established in the human self-realization and self-realization, ie the social self-present self
 manushya ko maansik shanti na to bhogavaadi swatv kii avhelnaa se milti he or na suswatv kii avhelnaa se
 Mental health and happiness are experienced by the coordination of both
 england ke ek prasiddh manovaigyanik dow wiliam brown man ke uparyukt sabhi staron ke pare manushya ke vyaktitv main upasthit ek aisi satta ko bhi bataate hai, jo desh or kaal kii seemaa ke pare he
 Its feeling is in the state of mental and physical relaxation
 unka kathan he ki jab manushya apane sabhi prakaar ke chintan ko samaapt kar detaa he or jab vah is prakaar shant avasthaa main pad jaataa he, tab vah apane hi bheetar upasthit ek aisi satta se ekatv sthapit kar letaa he jo apaar shakti kaa centre he or jisase thode samay ke liye bhi ekatv sthapit karne par anek prakaar ke shaareerik or maansik rog shant ho jate hai
 After establishing unity with it, human thoughts take a new turn
 phir e vichaar rogamulak na hokar swasthyamulak ho jate hai
 Modern psychology is now going towards the discoveries of Lord Buddha and Maharishi Patanjali
 man ke uparyukt teen bhaagon ke pare ek aisi sthiti bhi he jise ek ore shunya rup or duusari ore anant gyaanamay kaha ja saktaa he
 In this state, the seer and the scene unite and the Triputi Janya Gyan ends

 The Bessemer process was the first inexpensive industrial process to produce steel on a large scale from molten cast iron
 is prakriya kaa naam iske avishkaarak henry besimar ke naam par rakhaa gaya jinhone 1855 main is prakriya kaa patent karavaaya
 swatantra rup se is prakriya kii khoj wiliam keli ne 1851 main kii thi
 This process has also been used outside of Europe for hundreds of years, but did not occur on an industrial scale
 iskaa mukhya siddhant pighale lohe par hawa kii phuhaaren maar kar oxikaran dwaara lohe kii ashuddhiyon ko dur karnaa he
 Oxidation also increases the temperature of the iron mass and maintains it in a molten state
 mul durdamy parat ke upyog vaali prakriya ko mul besimar prakriya yaa gilcrist thomas prakriya ke naam se janaa jaataa he, yah naam iske avishkaarak sidney gilcrist thomas ke naam par padaa he
 This process is carried out in a large oval steel vessel with layers of clay or dolomite, known as Bessemer transformers
 is parivartak kii kshamta 8 se 30 ton pighale lohe kii hoti thi or saamaanya taur par ise lagbhag 15 ton bharaa jaataa tha
 There is a lid at the top of this converter which opens on the side where it is attached to the vessel, this causes iron to be inserted in and the finished product is taken out
 isaki tali main bahut se chhidr bane hote hai jinhen tuyiries kaha jaataa he, inke dwaara parivartak main hawa kaa dabaav daalaa jaataa he
 This converter is mounted on a rotating axis so that it can be rotated to insert the material, it becomes perfectly straight during the transformation and then later rotates back to eject the molten steel
 oxikaran prakriya silicon, mangneej, or carbon jaisi ashuddhiyon ko oxids ke rup main nikaal detii he
 These oxides are precipitated in the form of gas or solid solids
 parivartak main lagi durdamy paraten bhi parivartan main bhoomika nibhaati hai - chikani mitti kii paraton kaa istemaal acid besimar main kiya jaataa he, yah tab hota he jab kachche maal main halki phosphorus mili hoti he
 Dolomite is used when phosphorus is high in the original Bessemer - also known as the Gilchrist Thomas converter, named after its inventor Sidney Gilchrist Thomas
 steel ko aavashyak gundharm pradaan karne ke kram main, parivartan puraa hone ke baat pighale hue steel main anya padaarth bhi milaae ja sakate hai, jaise spiglacian 
 After drafting the required steel, it was put out in the doi and then transferred to the mold and the slag was left behind
 parivartan prakriya jise "blo" kaha jaataa he, 20 minute main puri ho jaati thi
 The progress of oxidation of impurities during this period was judged by the flame emanating from the mouth of the transformer: the modern use of photoelectric methods of recording the properties of the flame has greatly assisted the blower in quality control of the final product
 hawa ke jhonke dene ke baad, taral padaarth ko vaanchit bindu par punah-carbonikrut kiya jaataa tha or vaanchit utpaada ke aadhaar par anya mishradhatu padaarth milaae jate the
 Prior to the Bessemer process there was no experimental method in Britain to reduce the amount of carbon from pig iron
 steel kaa nirmaan carbon mukt bane lohe main carbon jodne kii vipareet prakriya dwaara kiya jaataa tha, jise aam taur par sweden se aayaat kiya jaataa tha
 This manufacturing process, called the assembling process, consisted of heated iron bars placed in stone boxes with charcoal for a week
 isse blistor steel kaa utpaadan hota tha
 3 tons of expensive coal was burnt to make each ton of steel
 aise steel ko salaakhon main dhalkar £ 50 se £ 60 prati ton ke hisaab se bechaa jaataa tha
 Although the most difficult and working part of the process, iron was used in Sweden's scum furnaces
 is prakriya ko 18 veen sadi main benjamin huntman kii crucible steel banane kii takanic ke aane ke baad parishkrut kiya gaya, is takanic main teen ghante kaa atirikt firing samay lagata tha or atirikt koyalo kii badi maatra main aavashyaktaa padati thi
 In making crucible steel, the blister steel rods were broken into pieces and melted into small scraps, about 20 kg in all of them
 The substance used to come

 The Bessemer process takes less than half an hour to produce steel of this quality, whereas coal is needed only to melt cast iron initially
 shuruuaat main besimar parivartak £7 prati ton ke hisaab se steel kaa utpaadan karte the, yadhyapi shuru main ise lagbhag £ 40 prati ton ke hisaab se bechaa jaataa tha
 Historian Robert Hartwell states that in the 11th century the Song Dynasty invented the "partial inorganization" method of repeatedly casting cast iron under cold blast
 itihaaskaar joseph nidham or vertime yah sweekaar karte hai ki yah vidhi, besimar prakriya kii purvavarti prakriya thi
 This process was first summarized by scholar and erudite government official Sen Kuo in 1075, when he was on a visit to Kizhou

 In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman developed the crucible technique of steel making in his workshop in Handsworth District, Sheffield
 is prakriya ne ispaat utpaadan kii maatra or gunvattta par bahut bada prabhaav daalaa
 Sir Henry Bessemer describes the origin of this invention in chapters 10 and 11 of his autobiography
 is kitaab ke anusaar siremian yuddh ke prakope ke baad bahut se angrej udyogpatiyon or niveshkon ne yuddh takneekon main ruchi dikhaai or swayan besimar ne topakhane ke projectile kii grouving ke liye ek takanic viksit kii taaki ve bandook kii bor main rifling kaa prayog kiye bina gum saken
 unhone 1854 main is vidhi kaa patent karaayaa or yah france kii sarkaar ke sangyojan se iskaa vikaas shuru kiya
 After a successful day of testing his method in Polygon, France, he spoke with claude-itini Minnie, who stated that the ability of the gun could be a major obstacle in the use of large, heavy rotating projectiles, and in particular "

 He does not believe it is not safe to fire a 30-lb shot from a 12-pounder cast iron gun
 asli sawaal jo unhone kaha wo yah tha ki kya itane baari projectile ko sahan karne ke liye koi bandook banaai ja sakati he?" yahi vah vajah thi jisane besimar ko steel ke bare main sochane par majaboor kiya
 At that time steel was difficult and expensive to make and as a result it was used in making small items such as knives and knives
 janvari 1855 ke shuru main unhone us tareeke par kaam karnaa shuru kiya jisase topakhaanon ke liye aavashyak steel kaa badi maatra main utpaadan kiya ja sake or oktober main unhone besimar prakriya se sambandhi apana pehla patent file kiya
 According to his autobiography, Bessemer first began working on an ordinary reverbatory furnace, but during a test, some of the molded ingots moved toward the doi and overheated the furnace's hot air
 jab besimar ne unhen waapas doi main daalane gaye to unhone paaya ki ve abhi tak shail the: garm hawa ne silliyon ke bahari bhaagon ko steel main badal diya tha
 This important discovery forced them to completely rebuild the furnace so that they could pass high-pressure air from molten iron using special air pumps
 Intuitively it seemed silly because doing so would cool the iron, but due to exothermic oxidation, both silicon and carbon reacted with excess oxygen to remove the hot iron, turning it into steel
 besimar ne apni prakiya ke liye patent ke license kul £27,000 main paanch lauhaswamiyon ko die, lekin licenson ne vaade ke anusaar gunvattta vaali steel kaa utpaadan nahin kiya or besimar ne £32,500 main inhen waapas kharid liya
 He realized that this problem was due to iron impurities and concluded that the solution could be found out when to stop the flow of air; So that impurities burn and the right amount of carbon is left
 However, despite spending thousands of pounds on experiments, he could not find the answer
 steel ke kuch grad 78% nitrogen ke prati samvedansheel hai joki steel se guzar rahi hawa kaa hissaa hai
 a simple but elegant remedy was discovered by the English metallurgist Robert Forrester Mushet, who conducted thousands of scientifically valid experiments in Dean's forests
 unki vidhi ke anusaar jitna sambhav ho sake sabhi ashuddhiyon or carbon ko pehle hi jala lenaa chahie, phir uchit maatra main spigelishyan jodakar carbon auki magnes ko punah jodna chahie
 This improved the quality of the finished product by increasing the malleability of the product — its ability to roll and forging at high temperatures and making it suitable for a wide array of uses
 is prakriya kaa license lene vaali pehali company dowles aayran company thi
 This company first used this process in 1865 to make Bessemer steel
 sanyukt rajya america main pehali besimar steel mil 1855 main detroit ke dakshin main lagbhag 14 mile kii duuri par michigan ke vandote main detroit nadi par sthapit kii gayi
 Detroit became the first steel-producing city in North America due to easy access to iron ore and Great Lakes shipping from North Mishigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota

 Of course, patents of such evidentiary value did not survive criticism and in many areas disqualification was freely asserted against them
 lekin besimar kaaphi bhaagyashaalee rahe ki unhone bina kanoonee jhagade ke apane patent ko sabit kiya, haalanki unhen laga ki ek patenti ke adhikaar kharid lenaa uchit rahegaa, jabaki robert forester muset ke maamle main, ve gaiyr-bhugtan fees ke kaaran 1859 main patent ke chook jane kii chintaa se mukt the
 Mushet's process was not absolutely necessary and Bessemer proved it in 1865, demonstrating a series of steel specimens made using only his process, but in conjunction with Bessemer's process for its near universal acquisition The values of the Mushet process were shown by
 muset ke patent kii nirantar ke bare main kuch bhi kah paanaa mushkil he, lekin 1866 main robert muset kii 16 saal kii beti landan main henry besimar ke offis main pahunchi or yah tark diya ki besimar kii safalataa unke pita ke kaary ke parinaamon par aadhaarit thi
 Bessemer decided to pay Mushet an annual pension of £ 300 a year, a very significant sum and paid for 25 years; And it is possible that this was done to avoid legal action by Mushet
 1866 main, besimar ne landan ke bedfort street par rahane vaale america ke locomotive ejeeniyar or patrkaar jerah colobern ko ejineering naam kaa saptahik akhbaar nikaalane ke liye paise die
 Colburn's philanthropist's name was revealed only years later
 ejineering laanch karne ke pehle, colobern ne di ejeeniyar ke pannon ke madhyam se besimar ke steel ke kaam or steel nirmaan main samarthan kiya tha
 Bessemer's process revolutionized steelmaking by reducing costs, as well as greatly increased the scale and speed of production of this important raw material
 is prakriya se steel banane ke kaam main majdoor varg kii aavashyaktaa main bhi kami aayi
 Prior to its introduction, steel was very expensive to design bridges or buildings, and therefore iron was used throughout the Industrial Revolution
 besimar prakriya kii shuruuaat ke baad steel or lohe ke mulya samaan ho gayi or adhiktar nirmaataa steel kii taraf mud gaye
 Due to the availability of cheap steel, it was used for construction of large bridges, railroads, skyscrapers and large ships

 This proven process of mass production of steel by Henry Bessemer paved the way for industrialization, as seen in the 19th – 20th centuries
 america main, is paddati dwaara vanijyik steel utpaadan 1968 main band kar diya gaya

 Although it is now used for many items, from computer software to luxury cars, historically it was only applicable to stitched clothes, shirts and other men's apparel with measurements and fittings
 bispok silaai ke visisth pahalu istemaal kiye jane vaale kapade, visheshtaayen tathaa upyuktata or paridhaan ke nirmaan ke tareekon par graahak kaa puraa niyantran hai
 And more generally, Bispoke can be described as having a high degree of customization and user involvement in the production of the item
 bispok shabd kriya tu bispik se vyutpann he, jiskaa matlab he" kisi baat kaa sanket dena" or vishesh arth he "ise banane ke liye aadesh dena"

 Although the term is used extensively in the United Kingdom, it is rarely used in the United States in this sense, although it may be used by some in the large-scale tailoring business
 bispok kapade paaramparik rup se graahak ke liye chihnit kiye gayi namoonay se alag hote hai or isliye ye ready-tu-viyar se bhinn hai, jo taiyaar sthiti main or manakikrut aakaaron ke mutabik kaarkaanon main bane hote hai or samyojit block pattern se praapt aadesh par utpaadit maap ke aadhaar par nirmit hote hai
 Resistance to these references may not initially suggest that bespoke clothing is necessarily better manufactured, but since the introduction of readymade clothing in the early 20th century, bespoke clothing has become more expensive and generally But they are manufactured with high quality
 jabaki hute kochar dwaara pradutt vishistataa france main vidhi dwaara surakshit he, british edverticument standerds athurity ne faisla diya ki bispok shabd kaa prayog vaise utpaadon ke liye karnaa acha he, jo puri tarah nirmaan ke paaramparik tareekon ko shaamil nahin karte
 paaramparik dargiyon ke vyapaar samooh savile bispok associyeshan ne is najariye kaa virodh kiya he
 Until the late 19th century the boundary line between bispoke and readymade clothing remained, however, "an undefined area of clothing was observed in which the customer was measured, but not always, if not always in the factory, making clothes of the nearest standard size Used to go " yahaan par antar yah he ki bispok kapade pehle se maujuud namoonay or maap ke mutabik banate hai, jo graahak main feet hone ke liye ek maanak pattern aakaar ko badal dete hai
 Technological changes make this distinction more nuanced, as "the need for fitting is increasing both for bispoke and fabrication by measurement; an individual cut pattern may be needed for bispoke service, which is then put forward And now measurements made according to measurements are often stored in a computer
 yahaan tak ki haath se kiye gayi kaam ko, aksar bispok kaa nirdesh chihn mana jaataa he, jo ab teji se maap ke anusaar bane vastron main paaya jane laga he, jabaki mashin kaa upyog adhiktar bispok suut banane ke kuch hisson main hota he

 abhi tak association ne hute kochar kii tulana main bispok ko ek sangrakshit label ke rup main safaltaapurvak sthapit nahin kiya he
 In June 2008, a British advertising regulator Advertising Standards Authority ruled that an advertisement, in which the suit was "cut and stitched by a machine, placed inside a 'working frame'", would be "uniquely tailored to your individual measurements and specifications
 Described as "bispoke suits"
 yah praadhikaran ke aatm ghoshit vigyaapan code, vishesh rup se satyavadita ke niyam kaa ulanghan nahin karata, kyonki bispok shabd ke prayog se bhram paidaa hone kii sambhaavna nahin thi
 This decision was important in deciding the less traditional definition of bespoke costumes, although by measure the older uniqueness of the construction was recognized
 is faisle main oxford english dictionari kii bispok kii "aadesh ke mutabik bana" paribhaasha ko uddhrut kiya gaya or kaha gaya ki is tathy ke baavjood ki bispok suut "puri tarah haath se bana he or ek rekhankan ke mutabik namoona kaata gaya he, saath hi madhyamik str par isaki dhili silaai kii gai he, jisamen pehali fitting shaamil he, taaki aadhe bane suut main aavashyaktaanusaar parivartan kiya ja sake" jabaki maap ke anusaar bane suut ko aamtaur par "maujuuda namoonay ke aadhaar par mashin dwaara kaata jaayegaa or graahak kii maap ke anusaar samyojit kiya jaayegaa
" "puri tarah bispok or naap lekar banaaye hue suut donon "aadesh ke mutabik" bane hote hai, kyonki ve graahak ke sateek maap or vinirdeshon ke mutabik bane hote hai, haalanki of da pegs suut main aisa nahin hota
" Some, like etymologist Michael Queenian, viewed the decision as "the term historical art has changed the subject", with some others concluding that "bespoke stitching, unofficially, has traditionally been interpreted in the dictionary
" Goes far beyond the definition "and stated that the ASA" made an ignorant decision by declaring that there is no difference in construction according to BISPOC and MEASUREMENT
 " " At one time, Bispoke, a special term of the fashion industry, started growing rapidly in other industries, including: tiruvallur bharat ke rajya tamilnadu kaa ek jila he

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Black hole ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 In general relativity, a black hole or a black hole or a Krishna vivar is such an astronomical object with such a powerful gravitational field that nothing can escape the light, including the stretch
 kalenidr ke chaaron ore ghatana kshitij naamak ek seemaa hoti he jisamen vastuen gir to sakati hai parantu baahar kuch nahin aa saktaa
 It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light falling on it and does not reflect anything
 yah ooshmaagatiki main thik ek adarsh krishnika kii tarah he
 Quantum analysis of the black hole shows that they contain temperature and Hawking radiation
 apane adrishy bhitari bhaag ke baavjood, ek kalachhidr anya padaarthon ke saath antah-kriya ke madhyam se apni upasthiti prakat kar saktaa he
 For example, black holes can be detected by the motion of a group of stars orbiting a part of the space that appears empty
 vaikalpik rup se, ek saathi taare dwaara aap apekshaakrit chote kalenidr main gas giraate hue dekh sakate hai
 This gas spirals inwards, heating up to very high temperatures and emits large amounts of radiation that can be detected by telescopes located on Earth or orbiting the Earth
 is tarah ke avlokanon ke parinaam swaroop yah vaigyanik sarv-sammati ubhar kar saamne ai he ki, unke swayan na dikhne ke baavjood, hamaare brahmad main kalenidr astitv rakhte he
 By these methods, scientists have discovered that a radio source called Dhanu a *, located in the center of our galaxy, Kshirmarg, has a giant black hole whose mass is 43 million times the mass of our sun
 saidhantik rup se, kisi bhi maatra kaa padaarth ek kalachhidr ban saktaa he, yadi vah itani jagah ke bheetar sankuchit ho jaay jisaki trigya apni samatuly schvarsscield trigya ke baraabar ho
 Accordingly, the mass of our Sun is 3 km
 m Radius of the earth and 9 mm of the earth It can turn into black hole when inside
 vyaavhaarik rup main electron or neutron aapjatya dabaav ke vipareet na to prithvi or na hi suraj main aavashyak dravyaman he or isliye na hi aavashyak gurutvkarshan bal he
 The minimum mass required for a star to be able to recover from these pressures and to be more compressed is the extent proposed by Tolman - Oppenheimer - Volkoff, which is about three solar masses
 ek kalenidr ko aksar ek aisi vastu rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa palaayan veg prakaash kii gati se adhik ho
 This picture is qualitatively incorrect but provides a way of understanding the order of magnitude of the radius of the black hole
 palaayan veg vah nunatam gati he jo ek vastu main honi chahie taaki vah vastu rukne se pehle kisi guruttvakarshan strot kii kaksha se bachakar nikal jaye
 The escape velocity on Earth is equal to 11
2 km / s, so no matter what the object is, a bullet or a ball, it must move at least 11
2 km / s to avoid falling back to the surface of the Earth
 neutonian yantriki main palaayan veg kii gananaa hetu, maaniye ki ek baari vastu he jiskaa dravyaman m mul par kendrit he
 a second object with a m { \ displaystyle m} mass starts at a v { \ displaystyle v} speed at a distance of r { \ displaystyle r} from the origin, tries to escape towards the infinity, with exactly the same kinetic energy
 Should be so that it can overcome the potential energy of negative gravity, leaving nothing later: is prakaar, yah jaise jaise r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r= \ infty } ke kareeb aati jaati he vaise vaise isaki gatij urja kam hoti jaati he, antat yah bina kisi gati ke ananthata par pahunch jaati he
 This formula represents the critical migration velocity v { \ displaystyle v} in terms of m { \ displaystyle M} and r { \ displaystyle r}
 lekin yah formula yah bhi kahata he ki v { \ displaystyle v} or m { \ displaystyle M} kii prayek value ke liye, r { \ displaystyle r} kii ek critical value hoti he taaki v { \ displaystyle v} gati vaala ek kan bhaagane maatr main safal rahe: When the velocity is equal to the speed of light, it provides the radius of an imaginary Newtonian dark star, a Newtonian body from which no particle moving at the speed of light can escape
 ek kalenidr kii trigya kii value ke liye sarvaadhik prayukt chalan main, ghatana kshitij kii trigya is neutonian value ke baraabar hoti he
 In general relativity, it is not easy to define r coordinates because of the curved nature of space-time and the selection of different coordinates
 is parinaam ke satya hone ke liye, r kii value ko is prakaar paribhaashit karnaa chahie taaki vakrit antariksh samay main r trigya ek sphier ke a satahi kshetra ko abhi bhi is formula dwaara prakat kiya ja sake a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle A=4 \ pi r^{2}} r kii is paribhaasha se koi arth tabhi nikalataa he jab gurutvkarshan kshetra spherickli samamit ho, taaki vahaan ek ke upar ek kai siyaar hon jinpar ekasmaan gurutvkarshan kshetra ho
 The escape velocity depends on the density of an object to escape its gravitational field; This is the ratio of its mass to volume
 ek kalachhidr tab banataa he jab koi vastu itani ghani ho jaye ki kisi khaas duuri tak prakaash bhi usase bachakar na jane paye, kyonki prakaash kii gati kalenidr ke palaayan veg se kam hogi
 Unlike Newtonian gravity, in general relativity, the light moving away from the black hole does not slow down and turn back
 schvarjaschild trigya abhi bhi vah antim duuri he jahaan se prakaash anantta ke liye batch saktaa he, lekin schvarjaschild trigya se shuru hokar baahar nikalne vaala prakaash waapas nahin aata he, vah baahar hi rahata he
 Inside the Schwarzschild radius, each object moves inwards, somehow to be crushed in the center
 saamaanya saapekshata main, kalachhidr kaa dravyaman kisi gurutveey apurvata) par kendrit rah saktaa he, yah ek bindu, ek challa, ek prakaash kiran, yaa ek sphier ho saktaa he; vartmaan main iske vishay main thik thik jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 There is a circular border around this singularity called the event horizon
 yah ghatana kshitij ko 'waapas lautne kaa sthaan' hota he, ek seemaa jiske pare saare padaarth or vikiran bheetar singhulerity kii taraf khinche chale aate hai
 Centrally, the distance between this singularity and the event horizon is the size of the black hole and is equal to twice the mass in the unit where g and c are equal to 1
 surya ke baraabar dravyaman vaale kalenidr kii trigya lagbhag 3 kimi hoti he
 For distances many times greater than this, the gravitational power of the black hole is exactly equal to the gravitational power of any other body of equal mass, just like the Sun
 isliye yadi surya ko samaan dravyaman vaale ek kalenidr ke parivartit kar diya jaye, grahon kii kakshaen aparivartit rahengi
 There are several types of black holes, which are identified by their specific size
 jab ve ek tara ke gurutvkarshan patan ke kaaran banate hai, unhen taarakeey kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 The mass of black holes formed at the center of galaxies can be several billion times the solar mass, they are called giant black holes because they are very large
 in donon paimaanon ke bich main kuch madhyavarti kalenidr bhi hote hai jinke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai hajaar gune tak hote hai
 Very low-mass black holes that are thought to have formed during the Big Bang in the early history of the universe may still exist and are called primordial black holes
 vartmaan main unka astitv abhi nishchit nahin he
 It is not possible to see a black hole directly
 haalaanki, aasapaas ke paryaavaran par uske guruttviya prabhaav dwaara uski upasthiti kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he, khaas kar microkvasar or sakriya gallexic nabhikon dwaara, jahaan paas ke kalenidr main girane vaale padaarth ati garam ho jate hai or eks-re vikiran kii badi maatra chhodte hai
 This observation method enables astronomers to ascertain their existence
 kalenidr ekmaatr aise padaarth hai jo in paimaanon par khare utarate hai or saamaanya saapekshata ke dhaanche ke anuroop hote hai
 The concept of a heavy body so incapable of escaping even light was revealed in a letter written by geologist John Michel to Henry Cavendish in 1783 and published by the Royal Society: 1796 main, ganitagya pierre-simon laplas ne apni kitaab exposishan du system du monde ke pehle or duusare sanskaran main isi vichaar ko badhaava diya tha 
 These "dark stars" were ignored in the nineteenth century, because then it was believed that light was a massless wave and therefore free from the effects of gravity
 aadhunik blike hole avadharana ke vipareet, aisa mana jaataa tha ki kshitij ke peeche kii vastu kaa patan nahin ho saktaa he
 In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he had already proved that gravity actually affects the speed of light
 kuch maheene baad, karl schvarjaschild ne ek bindu drabyaman or ek golakaar dravyaman ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa samaadhaan diya, yah dikhaate hue ki ek blike hole kaa astitv siddhanthata sambhav he
 The Schwarzschild radius is now known as the radius of the event horizon of non-rotating black holes, but this fact was not understood at the time, for example Schwarzschild himself did not consider it physical
 johanise droste nen, hendrick lorentz ke ek chaatr, swatantra rup se bindu dravyaman par schvarjaschild ke kuch maheenon ke baad aisa hi samaadhaan diya or iske gunon ke bare main bade paimaane par or adhik likhaa
 In 1930, astronomer Subramanian Chandrasekhar, using general relativity, calculated that the solar mass of a non-rotating body containing electron-generated matter would collapse if it exceeded 1
44
 unke tark kaa arthur edington dwaara virodh kiya gaya tha, jinka vishwaas tha ki koi vastu nishchit rup se is patan ko rokegi
 Eddington was partially right: a slightly dwarf white dwarf star above the Chandrasekhar range would transform into a neutron star after its collapse
 But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that due to the reasons given by Chandrasekhar, a star with more than three solar masses would collapse into a black hole
 oppenheimer or unke sah lekhakon ne shwarzschild nirdeshaank pranali kaa upyog kiya, jisane shwarzschild trigya par ganitiya vishistataa ko utpaadit kiya, duusare shabdon main, is sameekaran main istamaal kiye gaye kuch ghatak shwarzschild trigya par anant ho jate the
 This implies that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a "bubble" in which time "stopped"
 yah baahar se dekhne waalon ke liye ek vaid bindu he, lekin andar girane waalon ke liye nahin
 Because of this feature, collapsed stars have been known as "frozen stars" for some time, as an external observer will see the star's surface frozen at the moment the star's collapse falls within the Schwarzschild radius
 Must be taking yah aadhunik blike holon kaa ek gyaat lakshan he, lekin is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki jame hue taare kii sataha kaa prakaash bahut jaldi redshifted ho jaataa he or blike hole ko bahut jaldi kaale rang kaa bana detaa he
 Many physicists were unable to accept the idea that time halts within the Schwarzschild radius and that people had no interest in the subject for 20 years
 1958 main, david phinkeistein ne edington-phinkelsten nirdeshaank prastut karte hue ghatana kshitij kii avadharana pesh kii, jisane unhen yah sabit karne main sakasham kiya ki schvarjaschild sataha r= 2 m ek vishistataa nahin he balki yah ek adarsh ekaladisha jhilli ke rup main kaary karata he: karnatmak prabhaav ise ek hi disha main paar kar sakate hai
 There was no significant contradiction in this and Oppenheimer's results, but it expanded it by adding a falling observer's viewpoint
 finkelstin samet, abhi tak ke saare siddhant keval gaiyr-chakrit blike holon ko cover karte the
 In 1963, Roy Kerr found the perfect solution for recurring black holes
 isaki chakrit singhulerity ek bindu nahin balki ek challa thi
 After some time, Roger Penrose is able to prove that singularity is found within all black holes
 1967 main, khagolavidon ne pulsar kii khoj kii or kuch varshon ke bheetar yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki gyaat pulsar, teji se chakrit neutron taare hi hai
 By that time, neutron stars were also confined to theoretical curiosity only
 isliye pulsar kii khoj ne un sabhi ati ghanatv vaali vastuon ke prati ruchi ko jaagrit kiya jinaki sanrachana gurutveey patan se hona sambhav hua hoga
 Physicist John Wheeler is widely credited with coining the term black hole in his public speech Our Universe: Known and Unknown in 1967, more cumulatively as an alternative to the "star that has gravitationally fallen to full collapse"
 in the form of
 haalanki, whealer ne jor diya tha ki sammelan main yah shabd kisi or ne gadha tha or unhone isko keval ek upyogi laghu-shabd ke rup main apanaaya
 The term was also cited in a letter to AAAS by Anne Ewing in 1964: jab kisi bade taare kaa puraa kaa puraa eendhan jal jaataa he to usamen ek jabardast visphot hota he jise supernova kehete hai
 The substance that survives after the explosion slowly starts to shrink and takes the form of a very dense mass called a neutron star
 agar neutron star bahut vishaal he to gurutvkarshan kaa dabaav itnaa hoga ki vah apane hi boj se simatata chalaa jayega or itnaa ghanaa ho jayega ki blike hole ban jayega or shyaam vivar, krishna gart yaa blike hole ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 The No Hair Theorem states that, once established, a black hole has only three independent physical characteristics: mass, charge, and angular momentum
 kinhin do blike hole kii in visheshtaon yaa parameter kii value yadi samaan ho to unke bich bhed karnaa kaaphi dushkar ho jaataa he
 These characteristics are special because they are seen from outside the black hole 
 udhaaharan ke liye, anya kisi chargekrit vastu kii hi tarah ek chargekrit blike hole bhi samaan charge ko dur dhakelta he, is tathy ke baavjood bhi ki vidyut or chumbakeey balon ke liye jimmedaar kan photauns, aatanrik kshetra se bachakar nikal nahin pate hai
 The reason for this is the Gauss law, the total electric current exiting a large sphere is always the same and measures the total charge within the sphere
 jab charge blike hole main girtaa he, vidyut kshetra line bani rahati hai or kshitij se baahar kii or jhaankati rahati hai or ye kshetra line girane vaale sabhi padaarthon ke kul charge ko sangrakshit karti hai
 Electric field lines eventually spread uniformly across the surface of the black hole, establishing uniform field line density on the surface
 is sandarbh main blike hole ek aam condkating sphier kii tarah kaam karata he jisaki ek nishchit rasistivity hoti he
 Similarly, the total mass of a sphere containing a black hole can be found using the gravitational analog of the Gauss law, sitting far away from the black hole
 isi tarah, koniya gati ko bahut dur se, guruttviya-chumbakeey kshetra dwaara frem dreging kaa upyog karke mapa ja saktaa he
 When a black hole swallows a substance, its horizon oscillates like a wide membrane with friction, a transient system, until it is finally established
 yah vidyut-chumbakatv yaa gej siddhant jaise anya kshetra siddhant se alag he, jinamein kabhi bhi koi gharshan yaa rasistivity nahin hoti kyonki ve samay palatwaan hote hai
 Because a black hole eventually sets up in a final state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: very little about the gravity and electric field of the black hole
 Be able to provide information lupt jaankaree main ve sabhi chijen shaamil hai jinhen blike hole kshitij se bahut duuri se mapa nahin ja saktaa he, jaise kii, kul beryon number, laptone number, tathaa kan bhautikee ke lagbhag sabhi anya sangrakshit sudo-charge
 From here on, this behavior is so strange that it has been called the 'black hole information loss paradox'
 paaramparik rup se bhi blike hole main jaankaree kaa lupt hona kaaphi ajeeb he, kyonki saamaanya saapekshata ek lagrengian siddhant he jo upar upar se time reversible or hamiltonian prathit hota he
 But the black hole is not reversible due to the horizon: matter can penetrate into it but cannot escape
 ek aam blike hole main samay ke palatney ko white hole kaha gaya he, haalaanki entropy or kwantum makenix yah darshaate hai ki white hole blike hole ke samaan hi hai
 The no-hair theorem makes some assumptions about the nature of our universe and the substances involved, while other assumptions provide different conclusions
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi chumbakeey ekal-dhruvon kaa astitv he, jaisaa ki kuch siddhanton dwaara kaha gaya he, chumbakeey charge ek parmparik blike hole kaa chauthaa maapdand hoga
 Examples of the no-hair theorem are known for the following cases: ye apwaad kabhi kabhi asthir hote hai or kabhi kabhi blike hole se dur nai sangrakshit kwantum sankhyaon tak nahin le jate hai
 This theorem must apply in our four-dimensional and almost flat universe
 saralatam blike hole vah he jiskaa drabyaman he lekin na to charge he or na hi koniya gati
 These black holes are also known as Schwarzschild black holes, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1915
 yah oinstin kshetra sameekaran ke liye khoja jane vaala pehla vishwasaneey or sateek samaadhaan tha or birkhophf prameya ke anusaar yah ekmaatr nirvaat samaadhaan he jo spherickli cymetric he
 This means that there is no visible difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and the gravitational field of any other spherical object of equal mass
 blike hole ke liye yah lokapriy dharna kii yah apane chaaron ore "prayek vastu ko andar khinchataa rahata he" keval iske kshitij ke paas hi satya baithti he; duuri par, iskaa bahari gurutvkarshan kshetra anivaary rup se saadhaaran baari pindon kii tarah kaa hi hota he
 More common solutions to black holes were discovered in the late 20th century
 reissner-nordastrom metric vidyut charge vaale blike hole kaa varnan karata he, jabaki kerr metric ek chakrit blike hole pradaan karata he
 The Kerr – Newman metric is generally the more prevalent stationary black hole solution, which describes both charge and angular momentum
 haalanki ek blike hole kaa dravyaman koi bhi positive mulya le saktaa he, charge or koniya gati dravyaman dwaara baadhya hote hai
 In natural units, the total charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} and the total angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} are expected to satisfy the following m dravyaman vaale ek blike hole ke liye
 The black hole that fills this disparity is called extreme
 asamanta kaa ulanghan karne vaale oinstin ke samikarnon ke samaadhaanon kaa astitv he, lekin unamem kshitij nahin he
 These solutions have naked specificity and are considered immaterial, because the cosmic censorship hypothesis rejects this specificity because of the overall gravitational collapse of real substances
 yah sankhyatmak anukritiyon dwaara samarthit he
 Due to the relatively large force of the electromagnetic force, black holes formed by the collapse of stars are expected to retain the neutral charge of the stars
 chakran ko compact vastuon kaa ek saamaanya gun mana gaya he or aisa prathit hota he ki blike hole ke pratyaashee binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 kii koniya gati apane adhiktam sambhav value ke kareeb he
 Black holes are generally classified according to their mass, independent of the angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,}
 The size of a black hole determined by the event horizon radius, or the Schwarzschild radius, is proportional to the mass m { \ displaystyle m \ ,}, jahaan r s h { \ displaystyle r_{sh} \ ,} schvarjaschild trigya he or m ⨀ { \ displaystyle M_{ \ bigodot }} surya kaa dravyaman he
 Thus the size and mass of a black hole are simply related, independent of rotation
 is kasuti ke anusaar, blike holon ko is prakaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: The characteristic of a black hole is the appearance of the event horizon; a space of time beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer
 jaisaa ki saamaanya saapekshata ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi, dravyaman kii upasthiti antariksh-samay ko is prakaar vikrut kar detii he ki kanon ke maarg unhen us dravyaman kii taraf le jate hai
 This deformation becomes so powerful on the incident horizon of the black hole that there is no way to go out
 ek baar koi kan ghatana kshitij ke andar aa jaye, uskaa blike hole ke bheetar janaa avashyambhavi ho jaataa he
 For a spectator standing far away, the clocks near the black hole would seem to move more slowly
 is prabhaav ke kaaran, dur khadaa darshak yah dekhegaa ki blike hole main girane vaali koi vastu uske ghatana kshitij ke nikat aane par dhimi ho jaati he, us tak pahunchne ke liye anant samay leti hui prathit hoti he
 At the same time all the actions of this object slow down, resulting in the light appearing more red and dim, this effect is called gravitational red shift
 ant main, girane vaali vastu itani maddham ho jaati he ki dikhaai dena band ho jaati he, ek bindu par ghatana kshitij par pahunchne se thik pehle
 The Schwarzschild radius limits non-spherical event horizons for non-rotating black holes
 ek vastu kii schvarjaschild trigya dravyaman ke anupaat main hoti he
 Circled black holes have a distorted, nonspherical event horizon
 chunki ghatana kshitij ek bhautik sataha nahin he balki keval ek ganitiya paribhaashit seemaa he, padaarth yaa vikiran ko blike hole main pravesh karne se rokane vaala kuch bhi nahin he, keval baahar nikalne se inako roka jaataa he
 The description given by general relativity for black holes is an approximation and it is expected that quantum gravity effects become important from near the event horizon
 yah, blike hole ke ghatana kshitij ke nikat padaarth ke prekshan ko, saamaanya saapekshata or uske prastaavit vistaaron ke adhyayan ko sambhav banaata he
 Although black holes themselves do not radiate energy, electromagnetic radiation and matter particles can radiate from outside the event horizon, via Hawking radiation
 singhulerity blike hole ke centre main hoti he, jahaan padaarth main dabane ke kaaran anant ghanatv ho jaataa he, gurutvkarshan khinchaav anant shaktishaalee hota he or antariksh-samay main anant vikruti hoti he
 This means the mass of a black hole is completely compressed into a region with zero volume
 blike hole ke centre main is shunya-aaytan, anant rup se saghan kshetra ko gurutveey singhulerity kaha jaataa he
 The singularity of a non-rotating black hole is zero in length, width, and height; The singularity of a rotating black hole is ring-shaped and is located on the plane of rotation
 challe main koi motaai nahin hoti isliye koi aaytan nahin hota
 The presence of singularity in general relativity is generally considered an indication of the principle not being applied
 haalaanki yah apekshit he; yah aisi paristhiti main ghatit hota he jahaan kwantum yantric prabhaavon ko inkaa varnan karnaa chahie tha, ati ucch ghanatv or kan sahabhaagitaaon ke kaaran
 Until now it has not been possible to combine the effects of quantum and gravity in one theory
 aam taur par ummid kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv ke siddhant main singulerity rahit blike hole honge
 The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness where the photons will be trapped in a circular orbit, moving along the tangent of the sphere
 anavarti blike hole ke liye, photone sphere kii trigya schvarjaschild trigya kii 1
5 guna hoti he
 These orbits are dynamically unstable, so any small disturbance will also grow larger over time and either throw it beyond the black hole or push it within the event horizon
 haalaanki prakaash abhi bhi photone sphere ke andar se batch saktaa he, koi prakaash jo andar kii or jaati prakshepan path se photone kshetra ko paar karti he us par blike hole kaa kabja ho jaayegaa
 Therefore any light that reaches an audience standing outside from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by an object outside the photon sphere but beyond the event horizon
 neutron taron jaisi anya compact vastuon main bhi photone sphere ho sakate hai
 This is based on the fact that the gravitational field of an object does not depend on its actual size, so an object that is smaller than 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius would actually have a photon sphere corresponding to the object's mass
 chakrit blike hole chaaron taraf se argosphior namak ek antariksh-samay kshetra se ghira hota he jisamen sthir khada hona asambhav he
 This is the result of a process called frame-dragging; General relativity predicts that any rotating mass will try to stretch the space-time around itself
 chakrit drabyaman ke paas kii koi bhi vastu chakra kii disha main ghoomana shuru kar degi
 For a rotating black hole, its impact becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction just to stand still
 ek blike hole kaa argosphior nimnlikhit se ghira hota he: Within the ergosphere, space-time is drawn at a greater speed than light - in general relativity physical objects are forbidden to move faster than light, but space-time zones allow them to be compared to other space-time regions i can walk faster than light
 vasteen or vikiran, centre main gire bina argosphior ke bheetar kaksha main rah sakati hai
 But they cannot hover, because this would require them to travel faster than light backwards, compared to their own space-time zone, which is moving faster than light compared to an outside viewer
 vasteen or vikiran bhi argosphior se batch kar nikal sakate hai
 In fact, the Penrose process predicts that objects will sometimes fly out of the agosphere, for this they will gain energy by "stealing" some of the black hole's energy
 agar vastuon ke kul drabyaman kaa bada bhaag is tarah batch nikalataa he, blike hole kii ghoomane kii gati or dhimi pad jaayegi or antat shaayad ghoomana band bhi ho jaye | The fascinating image of the black hole is bound to raise the question of whether such bizarre objects actually exist, or are they merely imaginary solutions to the Einstein equations
 oinstin kii swayan kr yah galat dharna thi ki blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he, kyonki unka vishwaas tha ki patan kii ore agrasar kanon kii koniya gati unki chaal ko sthirataa pradaan karegi
 Because of this, the general relativity community continued to dismiss its opposing results for many years
 lekin unamem se kuch is vishwaas par kaayam rahe ki blike hole kaa astitv vastav main he, or 1960 ke dashak ke ant tak ve adhikansh shodhakartaaon ko yah vishwaas dilaane main safal rahe ki ghatana kshitij kaa nirmaan vaaki main sambhav he
 Once upon a time, Roger Penrose proved that there must be some form of syngularity within him
 iske kuch hi samay pashchaat, stephen hawking ne yah darshaya ki big baing ke kai brahmadia samaadhaanon main singulerity kaa astitv he, scaler kshetron or anya videshi padaarthon kii anupasthiti main 
 The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical characteristics of a black hole are simple and easily understandable, making them respected research subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki blike holon ke nirmaan kii praathmik prakriya taron jaisi baari vastuon kaa guruttviya patan rahi hogi, lekin kai anya prakriyaayein bhi hai jo blike hole ke nirmaan kii taraf le ja sakati hai
 Gravitational collapse occurs when the internal pressure of an object is insufficient to resist its own gravity
 taron main yah aamtaur par isliye hota he kyonki yaa to taron main apane taapmaana ko banaae rakhane ke liye "eendhan" aparyaapt he, yaa ek tara jo sthir tha use dher saare atirikt padaarth mili parantu uske crod kaa taapmaana nahin badhaa
 In both cases, star temperature would prove insufficient to prevent its collapse under its own weight
 is patan ko taare ke ghatakon ke aapjatya dabaav dwaara roka ja saktaa he, padaarth ek aakarshak ghani avasthaa main sanghanit ho jaataa he
 The result is a type of compact star
 What type of compact star will form will depend on the mass of the residue - the residuals have decimated the outer surfaces after the changes caused by the collapse
 note karen ki yah mul taare se kaaphi kam hoga- 5 se adhik saura drabyaman vaale avasheshon kaa utpaadan aise taron se hota he jinka dravyaman patan se pehle 20 se adhik rahaa hoga
 If the mass of the residue exceeds ~ 3-4 solar masses - because the original star was either too heavy or the residue has collected additional mass) - the neutron's inelastic pressure is also insufficient to prevent collapse
 iske baad aisi koi gyaat prakriya nahin he jo is patan ko roak sake or vastu patit ho kar blike hole main tabdeel ho jaayegi
 This gravitational collapse of heavy stars is attributed to the formation of most stellar mass black holes
 gurutveey patan ke liye bahut adhik ghanatv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the current age of the universe, this high density is found only in stars, but in the early universe the density was much higher soon after the Big Bang, which may have made the creation of black holes possible
 ucch ghanatv akele ek blike hole ke nirmaan ke liye paryaapt nahin he kyonki drabyaman kaa samaan vitaran, drabyaman ko ikattha hone kii anumati nahin degaa
 For the formation of ancient black holes in this dense medium, it is necessary to have initial cubic disturbances that can later grow under the influence of their own gravity
 praarambhik brahmad ke vibhinn modelon main in gadbadiyon ke aakaar ke bare main vyapak matbhed he
 Various models predicted the creation of black holes, ranging from Planck masses to hundreds of thousands of solar masses
 atah aadim blike hole kisi bhi prakaar ke blike hole ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakate hai
 Gravitational collapse is not the only process that can create a black hole
 siddhant rup main, blike hole kaa nirmaan ucch urja takkaron main bhi sambhav he jo paryaapt ghanatv paidaa karti hai
 However, so far, no such phenomenon has been detected, either directly or indirectly, as a lack of oscillating equilibrium in particle accelerator experiments
 iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki blike hole ke dravyaman ke liye ek nichali seemaa honi chahie
 Theoretically, this limit should be around the Planck mass, where it is expected that quantum effects would prove the theory of general relativity to be false
 is kaaran prithvi yaa uske aas paas blike hole ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko bilkul nakaara ja saktaa he
 However, some developments in quantum gravity suggest that the limit of this bond may be considerably lower
 udahaaran ke liye, kuch brinworld paridrishy plank dravyaman ko kaaphi neeche rakhte hai, shaayad 1 tev / c2 itnaa neeche tak
 This may allow the creation of microscopic black holes in high-energy collisions or large Hadron colliders of the CERN
 haalaanki ye saare siddhant kaaphi kaalpanik hai or kai vaigyaniko kaa mat he ki in prakriyaaon main blike hole kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he
 Black holes, once formed, continue to develop by absorption of additional substances
 saare blike hole antartaarkeey dhul or sarvyaapee vikiran ko lagaataar avashoshit karte rahenge, lekin inamen se kisi bhi prakriya kaa ek taarakeey blike hole ke dravyaman par koi khaas prabhaav nahin padataa he
 More significant contributions occur when a black hole is formed in a binary star system
 nirmaan ke baad blike hole apane saathi se kaaphi maatra main padaarth avashoshit kar saktaa he
 Extremely large contributions occur when a black hole merges with other stars or compact objects
 adhikansh akashgangaon ke centre main sthit ati vishalkay blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhawatah kai choti vastuon ke vilay ke dwaara hua hoga
 The same process has also been proposed to form some intermediate-mass black holes
 jaise jaise ek vastu ghatana kshitij kii taraf babbti he, kshitij phoolnaa aarambh kar detaa he or lapak kar usko nigal letaa he
 Shortly thereafter, the expansion of the radius is evenly distributed throughout the hole
 1974 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki blike hole puri tarah se kaale nahin hai, balki ye thodi maatra main tapiya vikiran bhi nikaalte hai
 They found this result using quantum field theory in a stable black hole background
 unke samikarnon kaa parinaam yah he ki ek blike hole ko kanon ko ek adarsh blike body spectrum main chhodana chahie
 This effect became known as Hawking radiation
 hawking parinaam ke baad se, kaiyon nen vibhinn tareekon ke madhyam se is prabhaav ko satyapit kiya he
 If this theory of black hole radiation is correct, then it is expected that the black holes will remove the thermal beam of radiation and this will cause the mass to decay, since according to the theory of relativity, the mass is just the high condensed energy
 Over time, black holes will shrink and fly in the air
 is kiranpunj kaa taapmaana blike hole ke satahi gurutvkarshanake anupatik rahata he, jo badale main dravyaman ke liye vipareet rup main anupaatik rahata he
 Hence larger black holes emit less radiation than smaller black holes
 5 saura drabyaman vaale ek taarakeey blike hole kaa hawking taapmaana kareeb 12 nanokelvins hota he
 This is much lower than the 2
7K produced by the space micro-wave background
 taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike hole hawking vikiran ke madhyam se jitna drabyaman chhodte hai usase adhik dravyaman ve cosmik microwave prishthbhumi se praapt kar lete hai, atah ve sikudne kii bajaay failte jate hai
 To achieve Hawking temperatures higher than 2
7 K, a black hole would have to be lighter than the Moon
 duusari taraf yadi ek blike hole bahut chota he, ummid kii jaati he ki uskaa vikiran kaa prabhaav bahut shaktishaalee ho jaayegaa
 a black hole that is even heavier than humans will vanish in a moment
 ek car ke vajan vaala blike hole ko vashpit hone ke liye maatr ek nanosecond kaa samay hi lagegaa, is dauraan kuch kshanon ke liye isaki chamak surya se 200 guna se bhi adhik ho jaayegi
 Light black holes are expected to evaporate even faster, for example a black hole with 1 tev / c 2 mass will take less than 10–88 seconds to completely disappear
 beshak, itane chote blike hole ke liye kwantum gurutv prabhaav se ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii ummid kii jaati he or yahan tak ki – haalaanki kwantum gurutv main hue haal ke vikaas is ore koi sanket nahin karte hai – parikaalpanik taur par aise chote blike hole sthir honge
 The presence of most accretion disks and gas jets is not a clear evidence of the presence of stellar mass black holes, as other more massless and very dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs can cause and create accretion disks and gas currents
 The behavior is the same as that around a black hole
 lekin ve aksar khagolavidon kii yah batalaakar madad kar sakati hai ki kis jagah blike hole kii talash faldaayi siddh ho sakati he
 But on the other hand, supermassive accretion disks and gas currents can be a good proof of the presence of a highly soluble black hole, because as far as we know, only one black hole can be the cause of these phenomena
 sthir eks-re or gamma kiran utsarjan bhi kisi blike hole kii maujuudagi sabit nahin karte hai, lekin khagolavidon ko yah bataa sakate hai ki kahan khoj karnaa faldaayi hoga- or inaki ye khubi hoti he ki ve kaaphi aasaani se nabulai or gas ke badalon se nikal pate hai
 But powerful, irregular X-rays, gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiation can help prove that that massive, super-dense object is not a black hole, so that the "black hole hunter" is focused on another object Can do
 neutron taron or anya ati saghan taron par satahen hoti hai or padaarthon kaa prakaash kii gati ke ek ucch pratishat par sataha ke saath takaraav, aniyamit antaraalon par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa utsarjan karata he
 The black hole has no solid surface, so the absence of intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals around a very densely compact object indicates that there may be a good chance of a black hole
 gahan parantu ek hi baar gamma kiran kaa nikalnaa kisi "nae" blike hole ke janm kaa sanket ho saktaa he, kyonki khagol-bhautikavidon kaa vichaar he ki grbs kaa kaaran yaa to kisi vishaal taare kaa gurutveey patan he athwa neutron taron ke bich takaraav, or in donon ghatnaon main blike hole kaa srijan karne hetu paryaapt drabyaman or dabaav shaamil hota he
 But it appears that a collision between a neutron star and a black hole can also produce a GRB, so a GRB is not evidence that a "new" black hole has formed
 sabhi gyaat GRB hamaari apni akashganga ke baahar se aate hai or adhikansh arabon prakaash varshon kii dur se aate hai isliye inase jude blike hole vastav main arabon varsh puraane hai
 Some space-physicists believe that some super bright X-ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate-mass black holes
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kasaar atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii abhivruddhi discs hai, kyonki ab tak gyaat koi bhi vastu itani shaktishaalee nahin he jo itnaa shaktishaalee utsarzan kar sake
 Quasars produce powerful emissions throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, including UV, X-rays and gamma-rays, and are also visible from a considerable distance due to their high brightness
 5 se 25 pratishat ke bich kasaar "radio laud" hote hai, yah sangya inke shaktishaalee radio utsarjan ke kaaran he
 a gravitational lens is formed when rays of light coming from a far away bright source are "twisted" around a giant object, between the viewer and the source object
 This process is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of general relativity theory
 is siddhant ke anusaar, drabyaman gurutvkarshan kshetron ko banane ke liye antariksh-samay ko "samete" rahata he or isliye parinamswaroop prakaash ko mode detaa he
 The image of the source behind the lens can appear to an observer as multiple images
 yadi strot, baari lencing vastu or paryvekshak ek sidhi rekha main hon, strot baari vastu ke peeche ek challe ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 Gravitational lensing can also be caused by objects other than black holes, because any very powerful gravitational field has the ability to bend light rays
 in bahu chhaviyon vaale prabhaavon main se kuch, sambhawatah sudur sthit akashgangaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Objects orbiting a black hole continue to explore the gravitational field surrounding the central object
 1970 ke dashak main khoja gaya, ek purana udhaaharan he, ek prasiddh eksre strot signs X-1 ke liye jimmedaar kalpit blike hole ke ird-gird parikrama karti abhivruddhi discs
 Although the matter itself cannot be seen directly, the flickering of the x-ray continues in milliseconds, as expected just before accretion from a hot mass-like material orbiting around a black hole of about ten solar masses
 Is performed
 eksre spectrum us vishisht aakaar ko darshata he jisaki apeksha us discs se kii jaati he jisamen aurbiting relativistic padaarth hon, ek louh rekha ke saath or jise ~6
4 kev par utsarjit kiya gaya ho, tathaa laal or nile kii taraf chaudaa kiya gaya ho
 Another example is the S2 star which is seen orbiting the celestial center
 yah tara ~ 3
5 × 106 saura drabyaman vaale blike hole se kai prakaash ghanton kii duuri par he, isliye isaki parikraman gati ko ankit kiya ja saktaa he
 Nothing is visible in the center of the supervised orbit, as would be expected from a black object
 ardh-aavadhik dolan kaa istamaal blike hole ke dravyaman kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique uses the relationship between the black hole and the inner part of its surrounding disks, where the gas continues to rotate inward before reaching the event horizon
 jaise hi gas kaa patan bheetar kii ore hota he, yah eksre vikiran prasaarit karata he jisaki tivrata ek nishchit kram se kam-zyada hoti rahati he or jo ek niyamit antaraal par khud ko doharaata rahata he
 This indicator is called half-period oscillation or QPO
 ek QPO kii aavriti blike hole ke dravyaman par nirbhar karti he; chote blike hole main ghatana kshitij nikat hi sthit hota he, isliye QPO kii aavriti ucch hoti he
 For black holes with greater mass, the event horizon is farther outward, so the QPO frequency is lower
 ab yah vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki prayek akashganga ke, yaa lagbhag prayek, centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole hota he
 The close correlation between the mass of this black hole and the rise of the host galaxy indicates that there is a deep correlation between the formation of the galaxy and the black hole
 dashakon tak, khagolavidon ne "sakriy akashganga" shabd kaa istemaal aisi akashgangaon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jinamein asaamaanya visheshtaayen hoti thi, jaise ki asaamaanya varnakrameey rekha utsarjan or ati shaktishaalee radio utsarjan
 However, theoretical and observational studies show that the galactic nuclei active in these galaxies may contain supermassive black holes
 in AGN ke modelon main ek kendriya blike hole hota he jo ki suraj se lakhon yaa arabon guna adhik baari ho saktaa he; ek gas or dhul kii discs jise abhivruddhi discs kehete hai; or do dharaaen jo abhivruddhi discs ke lambavat hoti hai
 Although it is expected that supermassive black holes will be found in almost all agns, the nuclei of only a few galaxies have been carefully studied in an effort to both identify and measure the actual mass of central supermassive black hole candidates
 Can be done
 aisi kuch ullekhneey akashgangaon ke udhaaharan hai, andromeda akashganga, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, or sombrero akashganga
 Astronomers believe that a supermassive black hole is located in the center of our own galaxy, in an area called Segitarius a *, because: 2002 main, habbal antarikshawya doorabeen ne jo avlokan prastut kiya ve sanket karte hai ki M15 or G1 naamak golakaar samoohon main madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole ke hone kii sambhaavna he
 This interpretation is based on the size and duration of the orbit of stars in spherical clusters
 lekin habbal saboot nirnaayak nahin he, kyonki neutron taron kaa ek samooh is tarah ke avlokanon kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Until recent discoveries, many astronomers thought that complex gravitational interactions in spherical clusters would expel newly formed black holes
 november 2004 main, khagolavidon kii ek team ne hamaari akashganga ke pratham or purnatah satyapit madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, jo segiterius A* se 3 prakaash varsh dur parikrama kar rahaa he
 This black hole, with a mass of 1300 solar masses, is in the middle of a group of seven stars, possibly a remnant of a massive star cluster that has fallen from the center of the Ganges
 yah avlokan is baat kii pushti karata he ki ati vishalkay blike hole aasapaas ke chote blike holon or taron ke avasorana dwaara apni vruddhi karte he
 In January 2007, researchers at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom reported the discovery of a black hole, possibly containing 10 solar masses and located in a galaxy called NGC 4472, at a distance of about 55 million light years
 hamaari akashganga main kai sambhavit taarakeey-dravyaman vaale blike hole shaamil hai, jo sagiterius A* kshetra ke ati vishalkay blike hole kii tulana main hamase adhik najadik hai
 All of these candidates are members of X-ray binary systems in which a more dense object draws substances from its partner through an accretion disk
 in jodon main blike hole teen se lekar ek darjan se zyada saura dravyamanon ke ho sakate hai
 The hitherto observable stellar mass black hole, Messia is a member of the binary system located in 33 galaxies
 siddhanthata ek blike hole ke liye koi nunatam aakaar tay nahin he
 Once they are created, they have the properties of black holes
 stephen hawking ne pratipaadit kiya ki atipraarambhik blike hole vashpit ho kar or bhi sookshm ho sakate hai, arthath sookshm blike hole
 The Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope is being proposed for the discovery of a supermassive black hole that evaporates, which was launched on 11 June 2008
 haalaanki, agar sookshm blike hole kaa nirmaan duusare tareekon se ho saktaa he, jaise ki antarikshawya kiran ke prabhaav se yaa coliders main, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki unhen nishchit rup se vashpit ho janaa chahie
 The formation of analogs of black holes in particle accelerators on Earth is reported
 ye blike hole anuroop gurutveey blike hole ke samaan nahin hote hai, lekin gurutv pramaatra siddhanton kii jaanch ke liye ye mahatvapurn hai
 They behave like black holes, which have nothing to do with gravity and the quantum theory of gravity, in line with the theory of strong nuclear power
 ve samaan hai kyonki donon string siddhant dwaara varnit kiye jate hai
 Therefore, the formation and dissolution of fire spheres in quark gluons plasma can be explained in the language of black holes
 rileytivistik haivi aayan colider main aag kaa gola parighatna blike hole ke kaaphi nikat kaa anuroop he or is anuroop kaa upyog karke iske kai bhautik gunon kii bhavishyavaanee sahi dhang kii ja sakati he
 a fireball, however, is not a gravitational object
 vartmaan main yah gyaat nahin he ki kya or adhik urjavan large hadran colider aashaa ke anuroop bade atirikt aayam vaale sookshm blike hole ke utpaadan main sakasham hoga, jaisaa ki kai shodhakartaaon dwaara sujhaayaa gaya he
 For a more in-depth discussion, see: Particle collision protection in the Large Hadron Collider
 saamaanya saapekshata main aise vinyas kii sambhaavna kaa varnan kiya gaya he jisamen do blike hole ek duusare se jude hue hai
 Such a configuration is usually called a wormhole
 varmholon ne kalpit vigyaan kathaon ke lekhakon ko prerit kiya he kyonki ve ati lambi duuri kii yatraaon ko shighrata se tay karne kaa saadhan pradaan karte hai, time travel bhi
 In practice, such configurations are almost impossible in astrophysics, as no known process seems to allow the creation of these objects
 1971 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki paaramparik blike hole ke kisi bhi sangrah ke ghatana kshitij ke kul kshetra ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, bhale hi ve aapas main takaraa kar ek duusare ko nigal len, arthath vilay ho jaae
 This is remarkably similar to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, where the field plays the role of entropy
 aisa mana jaataa tha ki shunya taapmaana hone kii vajah se blike hole kii entropy shunya hogi
 If this were the case, the entry of entropy-rich matter into the black hole would have violated the second law of thermodynamics, resulting in a decrease in the total entropy of the universe
 isliye, jacob bekensten ne prastaav rakhaa ki ek blike hole kii ek entropy chahie or ise ghatana kshitij kaa anupaatik hona chahie
 Since black holes traditionally do not emit radiation, the thermodynamic approach seems to be consistent, as zero temperature means infinite changes in entropy by any sum of heat, which means infinite entropy
 haalaanki, 1974 main, hawking ne ghatana kshitij ke paas pramaatra kshetra siddhant ko vakrit antariksh-samay par lagu kiya or paaya ki blike hole hawking vikiran chhodte hai, jo ek tarah kaa tapiya vikiran he or unru prabhaav se sambaddh he, jiskaa arth yah niklaa ki unamem ek saakaratmak taapmaana nihit he
 This reinforced the simulation between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics: using the first law of black hole mechanics, it can be concluded that the entropy of a non-rotating black hole will be one-fourth of the area of its event horizon 
 yah ek saarvbhaumik parinaam he or ise sampoorn brahmadia kshitij par lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jaise kii di citter antariksh kshetra main
 Later it was suggested that a black hole is an object with maximum entropy, that is, the maximum possible entropy of a single region of space would be the entropy of the largest black hole that can be contained in that region
 isaki vajah se holographic siddhant kii utpatti hui
 Hawking radiation refers to the specific temperature of a black hole, which can be calculated from its entropy
 taapmaana jitna giregaa, blike hole utana hi vishaal hota jaayegaa: jitani adhik urja avashoshit karegaa, utana hi adhik adhik thanda hota jaayegaa
 a black hole with approximately the mass of the planet Mercury has a temperature in equilibrium with celestial micro-wave radiation
 isse adhik baari hone par, ek blike hole prishthbhumi vikiran se adhik thanda ho jayega or yah hawking vikiran ke madhyam se utsarjit urja kii tulana main, prishthbhumi se zyada teji se urja praapt karegaa, isse bhi adhik thanda ho jaayegaa
 However, in a less massive black hole this effect would indicate that the mass of the black hole evaporates slowly over time, while the black hole will continue to heat up while doing so
 haalaanki ye prabhaav un blike hole ke liye naganya hai jo antarikshawya rup se gathit hone ke liye paryaapt rup se baari hai, ve kaalpanik chote blike hole ke liye badi teji se mahatvapurn ho jaayenge, jahaan pramaatra-yantric prabhaav haaavee hon
 In fact, small black holes will probably evaporate at a rapid rate and eventually disappear with an explosion of radiation
 haalanki saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog kisi blike hole kii entropy kii gananaa hetu kiya ja saktaa he, yah sthiti siddhanthata santushti dene vaala nahin he
 In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as the calculation of the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have similar microscopic properties
 lekin ek pramaatra gurutv ke santoshjanak siddhant ke bina, blike hole ke liye is prakaar kii gananaa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 However, little hope has been aroused by string theory, according to which the microscopic amount of freedom of a black hole is D-branes
 pradaan kiye gayi charge or urja dwaara di-brans kii avasthaaon kii gananaa karke, kuch khaas ati samamit blike hole ke utkram maap ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Extending the field of validity of these calculations is an ongoing area of research
 tathakthith jaankaree lop virodhabhas, yaa blike hole kendrikaran virodhabhas, moulik bhautikee main ek khulaa prashn he
 Traditionally, the laws of physics will remain the same, move forward or backward
 arthath, yadi brahmad ke prayek kan kii sthiti or veg kii maap kii jaye, to ham icchaanusaar ateet ke brahmad ke itihaas kii khoj ke liye peeche kii taraf kaam kar sakate hai
 The Louville theorem describes the conservation of the phase space volume, which can be understood as "conservation of information", so there is a problem in established physics as well
 kwantum yantriki main, yah kendrikaran naamak ek mahatvapurn gun ke saath mail khaati he, jiskaa sambandh prayikta ke sangrakshan ke saath he 
 However, black holes can violate this rule
 sthapit saamaanya saapekshata ke antargat yah sthiti sookshm kintu spasht he: sthapit no-hair prameya ke kaaran, yah kabhi nirdhaarit nahin kiya ja saktaa ki blike hole ke andar kya gaya? haalaanki, baahar se dekhne par, jaankaree vastav main kabhi nasht nahin hoti he, kyonki blike hole main girte hue padaarth ko ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne main anant samay lagata he
 It is necessary to emphasize that the equations of general relativity do in fact follow t-symmetry and that the fact that the above argument comes from the application of general relativity should be a bit cautious
 yah is tathy kii vajah se he ki time-cymetric siddhant dwaara time-reversal-acemmetric nishkarsh tak pahunchaana sambhav nahin he, jo is maamle main saamaanya saapekshata he
 Rindler coordinates, which are applied near the event horizon for an external viewer, are T-symmetric, so the existence of something like an "invariant" process can be ruled out
 yah sambhav he ki "virodhabhas" time-samamit siddhant par time-asamamit seemaa ko lagu karne kaa parinaam he, yah isko loshmit virodhabhas kaa ek prakaar banataa he
 Considerations of quantum gravity, on the other hand, suggest that there may only be a finite finite inverse measurement that will be related to the space near the horizon: but the change in the horizon's entropy and the Hawking radiation's entropy measure are sufficient Happens to contain all the transverse measurements of matter and energy that are falling into a black hole
 haalaanki kai bhautikeevidon kii yah chintaa he ki yah abhi bhi thik prakaar se samajha nahin ja sakaa he
 In particular, at a quantum level, the quantum state of Hawking radiation is determined only by what has previously fallen into the black hole; And the history of what had fallen into a black hole is determined solely by the quantum state of black hole and radiation
 yahi niyatatvvaad or kendrikaran kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 For a long time Stephen Hawking defied the idea, insisting on his original 1975 position that Hawking radiation is completely thermal, therefore completely disorganized, with no information of the material previously ingested by the black hole
 ; He argued that this information has been omitted
 haalaanki, 21 july 2004 main, unhone nayaa tark prastut kiya, apane pichley tark ke vipareet
 In this new calculation, the entropy measurement corresponding to the black hole passes out to the Hawking radiation
 haalaanki, ise siddhant main samaj paanaa bhi mushkil he, jab tak blike hole apana vashpikaran puraa na kar le
 Until then, it is impossible to establish a 1: 1 approach to Hawking radiation information and the initial state of the system
 ek baar jab blike hole puri tarah vashpit ho jaye, unki pahchaan kii ja sakati he or unamem hua kendrikaran sangrakshit rahata he
 By the time Hawking completed his calculations, it was quite clear by the ads / CFT relationship that black holes decay in a unitary way
 kyonki gej siddhanton main aag ke gole, jo hawking vikiran ke anuroop hai, nishchit rup se ekaatmak hai
 Hawking's new calculations have not been evaluated by the expert scientific community, because their methods are unintentional and of questionable conformity
 lekin khud hawking ne isapar paryaapt vishwaas jataate hue 1997 main caltech bhautikavid jon preskill ke saath lagaai gayi shart ke liye bhugtan kiya, jisamen media ko kaaphi ruchi rahi thi
 Leonard Saskind and Nobel Prize winner Gerard t Huft have suggested that the three-dimensional space around the black hole can be fully characterized by a two-dimensional behavior of the event horizon
 ve isapar vishwaas karte hai kyonki yah blike hole jaankaree-lop virodhabhas kaa samaadhaan kar saktaa he
 This idea has been adapted under string theory, and is known as holographic theory
