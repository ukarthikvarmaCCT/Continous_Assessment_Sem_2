 Pandit Gauridutt was the first preacher and exclusive devotee of Devanagari
 bacchon ko nagari lipi sikhaane ke alaava aap gali-gali main ghumkar urdu, farsi or angreji kii jagah hindi or devanagari lipi ke prayog kii prerana diya karte the
 a few days later you also established the 'nagari Pracharini Sabha' in Meerut and in 1894 gave a memorandum to the government on its behalf that the Nagari script should be accommodated in the courts
 hindi bhashaa or sahitya ke vikaas main pandit gauridatt ji ne jo ullekhneey kaary kiya tha usase unki dhyeynishtha or kaary-kushalta kaa parichay miltaa he
 The Nagari Script Council has instituted 'gauridutt Nagari Sevi Samman' in his honor
 pandit gauridatt kaa janm punjab pradesh ke ludhiana naamak nagar main san 1836 main hua tha
 Your father Pandit Nathu Mishra was a famous Tantric and Saraswat Brahmin
 aapaki praarambhik shiksha saadhaaran hi hui thi
 It was limited only to the work of panditai
 jab aapaki aayu keval 5 varsh kii hi thi tab aapke ghar ek sanyasi aayaa or aapke pitaaji ko usne aisa gyaan diya ki ve sab maaya-moh tyagkar ghar se nikal gaye
 Your mother had moved to Meerut with her two children
 meerut aakar gauridatt ji ne apane adhyayan ko aage badhaayaa
 After studying Algebra, Geometry, Surveying, Drawing and Crafts etc
 from the Engineering College of Roorkee, he also got a proper knowledge of Persian and English
 vaidyak or hakimi kii disha main bhi aapane apni yogyata se ullekhneey safalataa praapt kii thi
 Maharishi Swami Dayanand Saraswati visited Meerut when you were a teacher in the Mission School of Meerut
 munshi lekharaj ke bageeche main swamiji ne apane bhaashanon main ekaadhik baar is baat ke liye bahut khed vyakt kiya tha ki deshvasi hindi or devanagari ko tyagkar urdu-farsi or angreji ke das hote ja rahe hai
 These speeches of Swamiji had a great impact on the youth Gauridutt and from that time you resolved to propagate and propagate Devanagari
 swami dayanand saraswati kyonki apane bhaashanon main rashtriyata kaa prachaar bhi kiya karte the, atah angrej sarkaar aapako rajdrohi maanati thi
 When the officers of the Mission School came to know that Gauridutt ji listened diligently to Swamiji's speeches and also showed reverence to him, he expressed his displeasure over this to Gauridutt ji
 yuvak gauridatt par skool ke adhikariyon kii is ghatana kaa yah prabhaav padaa ki aapane apane swabhimaan kii raksha karte hue skool se turant tyaagptr de diya or duusare hi din meerut ‘vaidwada‘ naamak muhalle ke ek chabutare par ‘devanagari paathshaala‘ kii sthapana kar di
 Your own school became the form of 'devanagari College' later
 aapkaa nidhan 8 farvari san 1906 ko hua tha
 He also established the 'nagari Pracharini Sabha' in Meerut and in 1894 gave a memorandum to the government on his behalf that the Nagari script should be accommodated in the courts
 aapane gyaapan main devanagari lipi kii upadeyata or grahyata par is prakaar prakaash daalaa tha- ‘devanagari itani saral evam vaigyanik lipi he ki uske 36 akshar or 12 matraaen keval 3 din main aasaani se siikhe ja sakate hai tathaa 6 maheene main to uskaa puraa abhyaas kiya ja saktaa he
 In any other script, it is read as it is written
 padhane or likhane main kuch bhi antar nahin rahata
 'in the same memorandum, you also wrote in the end-' If you start writing Urdu and Persian words in Nagari script, then they will become very simple
 ‘ pandit ji iske liye dabaav daalate rahe
 As a result of your continuous efforts, on April 18, 1900, Sir Anthony mcdanal issued an ordinance to pave the way for the promotion and propagation of Hindi by approving the reading of Hindi in schools and schools in Uttar Pradesh
 pandit ji nagari or hindi ke itane diwane ban gaye the ki aapane apane angarakhe par jai nagari shabd bhi ankit kara liya tha or parmparik abhivadan ke samay ‘jai nagari‘ hi kaha karte the
 On his samadhi, therefore, people had inscribed the words Devanagari Prachanananda
 devanagari ke prachaar ke liye aapane jo ek geet banaaya tha usase aapaki lagan or nishtha kaa parichay miltaa he
 The beginning of the song was as follows: aapke devanagari-prem kaa sabase adhik supusht pramaan isse adhik or kya ho saktaa he ki apni mrityu se purv apane 1 june san 1903 ko jo apana vasietnama likhaa tha usamen apni puri sampatti nagari ke prachaar ke liye arpit kar di thi
 It was your heartfelt desire that 'devnagari Pathshalas' be opened from place to place with this fund
 ek atyant saadhaaran sthiti vaale is vyakti ne iske alaava apni khun-paseene kii kamai se arjeet 32 hajaar rupee kii raashi devanagari-prasar ke kaary main swaha kar di thi
 Pandit Gauridutt established many schools in place for the promotion of Devanagari, while also putting his writing in this direction
 aapane ‘nagari-sau akshar‘ 'akshar deepika‘, ‘nagari kii gupt vaarta‘, ‘lipi bodhini‘, ‘devanagari ke bhajan‘ or ‘gauri nagari kosh‘, ‘devanagari gajet‘ tathaa ‘nagari patrika‘ naamak patr kaa sampaadan tathaa prakaashan bhi kiya tha
 For this work, you often used to go to the fairs and games of your region and made people aware of the importance of Devanagari by displaying plays and giving speeches etc
 there
 apni is dhun ke kaaran janata aapako ‘devanagaripracharanand‘ or ‘hindi kaa sucraat‘ tak kahati thi
 It is worth mentioning here that before the establishment of 'kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha', you played an important role in the history of hindi-prachar by editor and publication of Devanagari Preacher in 1892
 yahaan tak ki aapke is kaary main bihar ke shri ayodhyaprasad khatri ne bhi apana yogadan diya tha
 Pandit Gauridutt wrote so many books for the promotion and dissemination of Devanagari script and edited several journals, in his 1870s he wrote a novel called 'derani Jethani Ka Kahani'
 yahan yah bhi gyatavya he ki bharatendu babu harishchandr ne hindi gadhy-lekhan san 1873 main prarambh kiya tha
 This novel by Pandit Gauridutt was published in 1870
 isse purv hindi-gadhy main saiyad insha allaa khan kii ‘rani ketki kii kahani‘ naamak pustak hi thi
 This proves that the first Hindi novel is the story of 'devrani Jethani'
 yah bade durbhaagya kii baat he ki hindi ke itihaaskaaron ke agrani acharya ramachandra shukla tak ne isaki upeksha karke pandit shraddharam fillori kii ‘bhagyawati‘ lala shrinivasadas kii ‘pariksha guru‘ naamak pustakon ko apane ‘hindi sahitya kii itihaas‘ naamak granth main kramshah ‘hindi kaa pehla saamaajik upanyaas' or ‘angreji dhang kaa pehla hindi upanyaas‘ mana he
 It is also a remarkable fact in this regard that on the publication of this novel, the then Governor of Uttar Pradesh also presented a prize of 'hundred rupees'
 aapke dwaara anudit ‘girija‘ naamak ek or upanyaas bhi ullekhneey he
 Where Pandit Gauridutt ji was a good prose writer, his talent in the field of poetry was also amazing
 iskaa supusht pramaan aapke ‘devraani jethaani kii kahani‘ naamak upanyaas kii bhoomika ke ant main die gaye us padya se mil jaataa he jo aapane uttar pradesh ke tatkaaleen governor dwaara puraskaar praapt hone par likhaa thah This automatically proves that in both prose-writing and poetry-writing, the name of Pandit Gauridutt is the leading and exclusive
 yah prasannataa kii baat he ki hindi ke kuch viveki adhyetaon kaa dhyaan gauridatt ji kii is pratibha kii ore gaya he or yah bhram ab dhire-dhire dur hota ja rahaa he ki hindi kaa pratham upanyaas ‘bhagyawati' or 'pariksha guru‘ na hokar ‘devraani-jethaani kii kahani‘ hi he
 The novel was first published in 1870 in Leitho method in the 'ziya raidkhana' of Meerut and its copy is still preserved in the 'national Library Calcutta'
 is upanyaas kaa punarprakashan ab patna vishvavidhyalay ke praadhyaapak or ‘samiksha‘ naamak shodh-patrika ke sampadak dow gopal raay ne karke vastav main ek abhinandaneey kaary kiya he

 Metal and wood arts have been an integral tool in the life of human civilization in every country and in every era, through which man has tried to make his life easy, happy and prosperous
 pragaitihaasik kaal se hi prakruti ko vijayi athwa pramohit karne ke liye or jivan main ek niyamit niyantran laane ke liye, bhay se ho athwa shraddha se, jab manushya ne apane chaaron ore ke vaataavaran kii taal se apane jivan ko sanyojit kiya to uskaa yah praytn kala ko keval sundarataa ke liye varan karnaa na tha balki usamen uske jeevananirvaah or dainik kriya kaa lakshya kendrit tha
 We see that the art of the stone age, the copper age and the ages after it is based on this ideal and goal, not just to beautify an unusable object
 yahi kaaran he ki jahaan ek ore unke dwaara bane hue dainik kaaryon main kaam aanevaali in dhaatu or kashtha kii vastuon main bhi unke jivan, dharm or saamaajik vyavastha kii chhap spasht he, vahaan duusari ore inhen vastuon dwaara ham unamem nihit supt saundarya bodh kii jhaanki bhi pate hai
 It is not right to say that wood was used later than metal
 haan, yah avashya he ki lakdi kam tikaoo madhyam hone ke kaaran usamen udhaaharan hamen itane pracheen nahin praapt hote, jitne dhaatu, haddi athwa pathar main milte hai
 The architecture of the historical era, whether it is a dwelling dwelling, temple, Chaitanya or Vihara, confirms that all these things would have been made in wood before that
 lomas kii kuti, sanchi ke dwaar or khidki, ajanta kii gufaaon kii banaavat iskaa jwalanth pramaan hai jo pathar main bani hokar bhi unki kalpana or yojana lakdi ke madhyam par hi aadhaarit he
 Although these useful items of daily life were not created with the goal of fine arts, we must be able to see the part of the art of collective life in them and if these are called artistic things then we will not forget them
 sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath saath maanav ne yadhyapi apni nirmit vastuon main upyogi dharna ko nahin choda par ham dekhte he ki uski kalapriyata ne apni pravaahashiltaa dwaara kuch maatra main unhen lalit kala ke sundar upadan bana diya he
 It is only a gift of the modern era that where art became individual and not collective, on the other hand, its usefulness was for art, art, on the other hand, it is another matter that the effect of this useless art is also our useful things
 But lay and in a way he took a collective form
 aaj ke vaigyanik yug main yatayaat ke viksit sadhano dwaara kala kaa ek naveen rup antarrashtriyata bhi saamne aa rahaa he jahaan kisi raashtra kii raajnneetik, saamaajik athwa dharmik paridhiyaan tut chuki he or maanavtaa ek sanyukt drushtikon main aabaddh hokar bhi, kala vyaktigat moulikta ko nahin chhod pai he kyonki manovaigyanik vichaaron se bhi abhibhoot hokar vyaktivishesh ke antaraal main supt laalasaaon, kaamanaayon or pratirodhi ashankaon ko bhi ab kala ke upaadaanon kii uchit saamagree maan liya gaya he
 The metal sculpture of Mohenjodaro's dancer is clearly reflected in the scale, attitude and essential qualities of the art of that period and if we look in the later metal sculptures which started to become abundant from the tenth century, the dancer It is full of all the qualities that a high quality idol should have
 nataraj kii kaanse kii murti kii bhavpurn gatishiltaa main ham paramparaagat kala saundarya ke sab lakshanon ke saath saath aadhunik maapdandon dwaara bhi use sarvagun sampann pate hai
 The Shata Ardhanayan-nominated mildness of the idol of Napali Tara, the unnecessary adornment around it, which gradually increased in later statues, could not hide from anyone
 yadhyapi is prakaar kii yah sabhi murtiyan dharmik bhaawanaaon ko lekar baniin tathaapi unke kalasaundarya ke kaaran vah sarvapriya dharmanirpeksh ho sakin
 There were three types of metal sculptures, cast, beaten and cast
 dhaali hui murtiyan prarambh main mom dwaara bana lee jaati thim
 And then a thick coating was made by dipping the idol in a thin fine clay solution
 neeche lagi hui mom kii nalee dwaara jo prayek murti ke aavashyaktaanusaar sthanon par laga lee jaati he garmi dekar mom baahar nikaal diya jaataa or usee rikt sthaan ko unheen naleevaale maarg se dhaatu dwaara bhar diya jaataa he
 All the idols of silver, gold, bronze, brass and Ashtadhatu are molded in this way
 duusari prakaar kii murtiyon main dhaatu kii chadar ko peeche kii ore se peet petakar ubhaar liya jaataa he or ise ubhare hue vibhinn ang ke kholon ko jod diya jaataa he
 Sometimes the decorations of the molten idols are made by beating and folded later or the throne or ornamentation of the molten idols remain in the mold
 dakshin bharat, nepal or gujarat aisi murtiyon kaa centre rahaa he or ab bhi vahaan paramparaagat style or vidhi se in murtiyon kaa nirmaan hota he, yadhyapi ab inkaa lakshya dharmik kam or adbhut vastuon kii rachana kar videshi mudra arjan karnaa adhik he
 Apart from the idols, the worship work temple and the things which are used in daily life are still made in the traditional style like Kalash, Dharti, Pradeep, Purna Kumbh Hour, Chhip Lakshmi, Sarout, Knives etc
 which are still lively and are still a local style Let's charm
 kashtha kala ke adhiktar praapt namoonay hamen madhyayug se purv ke nahin milte par unki kalanipunata or kaushalparakashtha dekhakar sahaj main hi maan liya ja saktaa he ki us ucch koti ke str tak pahunchne ke liye is prakaar kii kala kii parampara bahut puraani rahi hogi
 The best examples of woodwork of sandalwood, walnuts, rosewood, avanus, jackfruit, sheel, neem, are found in the buildings of Kathmandu, Ahmedabad, and the large size chariots used during the Rath Yatra in Kerala
 swatantra murtiyon kii apeksha in sabhi kaa dhyey kashtha vastu kala kaa ek alankrita ang hona tha par kalakaaron ko apni apni shilp chaturata or praudhata dikhaane kaa kaaphi avasar mila he or ye lakdi ke makaan, aradhana athwa vasasthaan hone ke kaaran, dharmik vishay par hi adhik protsaahan hone par bhi ham pate hai ki dharmanirpeksh vishay jaise shikari, pashupakshi, dainik jivan main tallin narnariyon se in bhawanon kii khudaai otprot he
 After excavation, oil must be used to refine these buildings at the time of the annual celebrations, due to which the wood-like medium has been able to bear the cruel brunts of time and climate
 kuch bhawan to ab bhi kal ke bane hue se nae dikhte hai
 Sandalwood and walnut wood, which is the hub of Mysore and Kashmir, have been brought into the art of making small and large items of daily life of art forms and animal husbandry, shoulders, boxes etc
 uskaa vishesh kaaran is prakaar kii lakdi kii durlabhta or badi paridhi ke ped na hona hi he
 Even during the Mughal period, this art flourished and for the work of the Aavnus, whose elaborate combs, combs, kaladan cans etc
 were made
 uttar pradesh ke nagar nagina or saharanpur vikhyath hue
 From the same period, the inlay work of brass wire with the use of brass wire, oyster or different types of wood on wood also started

 Somewhere he was lost, and somewhere his skilled craftsmen took up other trades for the survival
 dhani shikshit varg videshi vastuon kii sabhyataa or kala kii chakachaundh main apni parishkrut ruchi gavaan baithe
 Educated artists also followed foreign art, but over the years, now these lost magnificent arts are getting noticed and many budding artists have made wood sculpture their medium in which we today have a beautiful co-ordination of international art with Indian traditional style
 Find it
 prayek madhyam kaa apana swatantra gun or charitra he jo duusare madhyam main hamen nahin miltaa
 The metal idol should not look like wood and the idol of wood should not look like stone, cement or metal and by examining its inherent properties, keeping in mind the medium, the vein, the color, the form, the artist should imagine his work and his secret beauty Do it so that a mixture of fluctuations, lines, etc
, presents an original work, this is the aim and purpose of the modern artist
 bahyarup kuch bhi ho par hamaari kala ke mul siddhant, jo shadang ke antargat aate hai, ab bhi kisi bhi maap dand se khare utarate hai chaahe drushtikon kitna hi ati aadhunik ho

 Scientific management is a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes work flow and thus helps in increasing labor productivity
 iske mul siddhanth 1880 evam 1890 ke dashakon main fredrick winslo tailor dwaara pratipaadit kiye gayi jo unki rachanaaon "shop management" tathaa "da principuls of sintific management" ke dwaara prakaash main aaye
 Taylor believed that practices based on convention and "rule of thumb" should be replaced with methods that were developed as a result of a careful study of the work of workers
 vastut: tailorvaad, dakshata vruddhi kaa doosraa naam he
 In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, there was a lot of discussion about increasing efficiency in human life, reducing waste, using experimental methods etc
 tailorvaad ko inkaa hi ek ansh mana ja saktaa he
 In the early days of the Industrial Revolution, while there was no established method of factory organization, the factory owner or the manager relied mostly on individual decisions when solving management problems
 ise angootha tech niyam kaha jaataa he
 While managing the factories by adopting the thumb-thumb rule, the managers could work according to the situation, but they had to face the limitations of effort and origin
 unke anubhav ko vishistataa pradaan karne ke liye yah jaananaa mahatva rakhata tha ki koun kaary ko karata he tathaa yah aisa kyon karata he? iske liye jis maarg par chalanaa tha, vah vaigyanik paddati par aadhaarit thi arthath samasya ko paribhaashit karnaa, vaikalpik samaadhaanon kaa vikaas karnaa, parinaamon kaa purvanumaan lagaana, pragati ko maapna evam parinaam nikaalnaa aadi
 In this scenario, Taylor emerged as the father of scientific management
 unhone angootha tech ke sthaan par vaigyanik prabandh sujhaayaa
 He divided human activities into small parts and found out how he could do it with less time and more productivity
 isamen vyavsaayik kriyaaon ko stareey upkaran, 
 In the words of taylor baithlaham steel company, jisamen tailor swayan karyrat the, main vaigyanik prabandh ke siddhanton ko lagu karne se utpaadakta main teen guna vruddhi hui
 Therefore it would be appropriate to consider these principles
 tailor ne prabandh ke kshetra main vaigyanik paddati ko lagu karne kii pahal kii
 We have already discussed the limitations of the Management Thumb Tech rule
 ab kyonki sabhi prabandhak apane-apane angootha tech niyamon ko apnaayenge isliye swabhaavik he ki sabhi samaan rup se prabhavi nahin honge
 Taylor believed that increasing efficiency was the only best method
 is paddati ko adhyayan evam vishleshan ke dwaara viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 The method developed in this way should be applied in place of the 'thumb Tech Rule' throughout the organization
 vaigyanik paddati main praarambhik pranaaliyon kaa kaary adhyayan, sarvshereshth tareekon kaa ekikaran evam stareey paddati ke vikaas ke madhyam se jaanch padtaal sammilit thi, jise ki puure sanghathan main apanaaya janaa chahie
 According to Taylor, the small production process of loading iron rods in canned trains can also be planned and managed scientifically
 isse maanviya shakti evam samay tathaa maal kii barbaadi main baari bachat hogi
 The more systematic the process, the greater the savings
 vartmaan sandarbh main internet kaa prayog aantarik kaarykushalta evam graahak kii santushti main ascharyajanak parivartan laayaa he
 In the factory system of production, there are links between managers, owners and workers
 prabandhakon ko shramikon se kaary puraa karaane kaa adhikaar mila hota he isliye aap saralata se samaj sakate hai ki ek prakaar ve varg bhed arthath prabandhak banaam shramik, kii sadaa sambhaavna bani rahati he
 Taylor found that because of this confrontation, workers, managers or factory owners do not benefit anyone
 usne prabandh evam shramikon ke bich puri tarah se sahyog par jor diya
 Both should understand that both are important
 is sthiti ko paane ke liye tailor ne prabandhak evam shramik donon main sampurna maansik kranti kaa aahwan kiya
 This meant that there should be a change in the thinking of both managers and workers
 aisa hone par shramik sanghathan bhi hadtaal karne aadi kii nahin sochenge
 If the company benefits, then managers must share it among employees
 karmchaariyon ko bhi chahie ki company kii bhalaai ke liye vah parishram karen evam parivartan ko apnaayen
 According to Taylor, scientific management is based on the conviction that the interests of both are the same, the prosperity of managers without the prosperity of employees and conversely the prosperity of the workers without the prosperity of the workers can also not last long
 japaniyon kii kaary samskruti is sthiti kaa utkrisht udhaaharan he
 Japanese companies administer ancestral style
 prabandhak evam shramikon ke bich kuch bhi chupa nahin hota
 Workers strike black cats if they go on strike, but they work more than normal hours to get the sympathy of the management
 vyaktvaad ke sthaan par shram evam prabandh main purnroop sahyog hona chahie
 This cooperation is not an extension of the principle of collision
 pratiyogita ke sthaan par sahyog hona chahie
 Both should understand that both need each other
 iske liye aavashyak he ki yadi karmchaariyon kii ore se koi rachanaatmak suzav aata he to us par dhyaan dena chahie
 If his suggestion reduces the cost enough, he should get the award
 unki prabandh main bhagidaari honi chahie or jab bhi koi mahatvapurn nirnay liya jaae to shramikon ko vishwaas main lenaa chahie
 Along with this, workers should also not go on strike and do not demand unfair treatment
 vastav main yadi khuli sampreshan vyavastha evam aapas main vishwaas hoga to shram sanghathan kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin hogi
 Japanese companies will have the same patrilineal style arrangement in which the employer takes into account the needs of the employees
 tailor ke anusaar shramik evam prabandh ke bich kaary evam uttardaayitv kaa lagbhag samaan vibhaajan hoga
 The entire time management will work side by side of the employees
 unki sahaayta karegaa, protsaahit karegaa evam unka maarg prashast karegaa
 Industrial work capacity depends largely on the qualifications of the employees
 vaigyanik prabandh bhi karmchaariyon ke vikaas ko manyata detaa he
 Training of staff was necessary to learn the best method developed as a result of working in a scientific manner
 tailor kaa vichaar tha ki kaarykushalta kii neenv karmchaaree chayan prakriya main hi pad jaati he
 Every person should be selected scientifically
 jo kaary use saunpa jaataa he vah uski shaareerik, maansik evam bauddhik yogyataon ke anuroop hona chahie
 They should get the necessary training to increase their efficiency
 kaarykushal karmchaaree donon kii adhiktam kaarykushalta evam samruddhi sunishchit hogi
 It is clear from the above description that Taylor was a staunch supporter of the scientific method in the production of business
 tailor dwaara nirdhaarit takneekein uske apane karier / jivan vritti ke dauraan kiye gaye shodh kaaryon par aadhaarit hai
 In the factory system, the foreman is the manager, who directly comes to the workers daily in contact
 is pustak ke pratham adhyay main aapane padhaa ki forman nimnatam str kar prabandhak or ucchtam shrenee kaa shramik hota he
 It is the focal point around which the entire production planning, implementation and control revolves
 tailor ne kaarkaana dhaanche main is bhoomika ke nishpaadan ke sudhaar par dhyaan diya
 Prepared a list of qualifications of a really good foreman / supervisor but found that no person could fulfill them, so he suggested functional foremanship through eight persons
 tailor ne niyojan evam uske kriyanvayan ko alag-alag rakhane kii vakaalat kii
 This concept was extended to the lowest level of the factory
 yah kriyaatmak formanship kehalaata he
 There were planning officers and production officers under the factory manager
 niyojan adhikari ke adheen chaar karmchaaree kaary kar rahe the_ jinke naam hai nirdesan card clerk, kaarykram clerk, samay evam laagat clerk, evam kaaryshaala anushaasak
 These four respectively will prepare instructions for employees, employees, prepare production schedule, schedule time and cost list and ensure discipline
 utpaadan adhikari ke adheen jo karmchaaree kaary karenge ve hai-gatinayak, tolinayak, marammat nayak evam nireekshak
 They are respectively responsible for preparing working hours properly, keeping machine tools fit for work by workers and checking the quality of work
 kriyaatmak formanship shramavibhaajan evam vishishtikaran ke siddhant kaa nimnatam str tak vistaar he
 Every worker has to take orders from these eight Formanas of production work or related process
 forman main buddhi, shiksha, chaturth, sthirataa, nirnay, vishisht gyaan, shaareerik dakshata evam urja, eemaandaaree tathaa acha swasthya
 Because all these qualities cannot be found in one person, Taylor suggested a team of eight experts
 prayek visheshgy ko uski apni yogyatanusaar kaary saunpa jaataa he
 For example, those who are well-versed in technology, are intelligent and have a stable mind can be assigned planning tasks
 jo urjavan hai evam acha swasthya liye hai unako kriyanvayan kaary saunpa ja saktaa he
 Taylor was a strong advocate of standardization
 uske anusaar aguntha tech niyam ke antargat utpaadan paddatiyon ke vishleshan ke liye vaigyanik paddati ko apnaanaa chahie
 The best system can be reserved for standard development and further improvements that should be put into use throughout the organization
 isko kaary adhyayan takneekon ke madhyam se kiya ja saktaa he jisamen samay adhyayan, gati adhyayan, thakaan adhyayan evam kaarividhi adhyayan sammilit hai tathaa jinka varnan isi adhyay main aage kiya gaya he
 It should be noted that contemporary techniques of business process, engineering, caiman and milestones were also the goal of certification
 pramapikaran se abhipraay prayek vyavsaayik kriya ke liye maanak nirdhaaran prakriya se he
 The standardization process can be of raw material, time, product, machinery, working method or working conditions
 yah maanak maandand hote hai, utpaadan ke dauraan jinka paalan karnaa hota he
 The objectives of standardization are as follows: sarleekaran kaa uddeshy vyarth kismon, aakaar evam ayaamon ko samaapt karnaa hota he, jabaki pramapikaran kaa arth he vartmaan kismon ke sthaan par nayi kismein taiyaar karnaa
 In simplification unnecessary redundancy of production is eliminated
 isse shram, mashin evam upkarnon kii laagat kii bachat hoti he
 This includes keeping the goods unmanned or low, total use of equipment and increasing the period
 adhikansh badi companiyaan jaise nokia, toyota, evam microsofrat aadi ne pramapikaran evam sarleekaran kaa safaltaapurvak kriyanvayan kiya he
 This is evident from their huge share in their respective markets
 kaary paddati adhyayan kaa uddeshy kaary ko karne kii sarvshereshth paddati ko foondnaa he
 There are many ways of doing a task
 sarvshereshth maarg ke nirdhaaran ke kai prachal hai
 Every process of action, from obtaining raw materials to delivering finished goods to the customer, is under study
 tailor ne kaary paddati adhyayan ke madhyam se kai kriyaaon ko ek saath jodne kii avadharana kaa nirmaan kiya
 Ford Motor Company successfully used this concept
 aaj bhi auto companiyaan isko apana rahi hai
 The objective of this entire process is to keep production costs to a minimum and provide maximum quality and satisfaction to the customer
 iske liye kai takneekon kaa prayog hota he jaise, prakriya chart evam parichaalan anusandhan aadi kaa prayog
 To design a car, the set line means to determine the order of operations, location of employees, machines and raw materials etc
 yah sabhi kuch kaarividhi adhyayan kaa bhaag he
 Motion studies study the movements of various postures, which are performed to perform a particular type of work, such as lifting, keeping, sitting or moving
 anaavashyak cheshtaaon ko samaapt kiya jaataa he jisase ki kaary ko bhalee-bhanti puraa karne main kam samay lagata he
 For example, Taylor and his partner Frank Gilberth reduced brick making efforts from 18 to 5
 tailor ne yah dikhaa diya ki is prakriya ko apnaane se utpaadakta chaar guna bad gai
 If the postures of the body are studied closely, you will find that - vibhinn mudraon kii pahchaan karne ke liye tailor ne stopwach, vibhinn chihnon evam rangon kaa prayog kiya, gati adhyayan kii sahaayta se tailor aise upkaran dizin karne main safal rahaa jo shramikon ko unke prayog ke sambandh main shikshit karne main upyukt the
 The results it produced were truly amazing
 bhalee-bhanti paribhaashit kaary ko puraa karne ke liye yah maanak samay kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 Time measurement methods are used for each component of the task
 kai baar maap kar puure kaary kaa maanak samay nishchit kiya jaataa he
 The method of time study will depend on the quantity and frequency of work, time cycle of operation and cost of time measurement
 samay adhyayan kaa uddeshy karmiyon kii sankhya kaa nirdhaaran, upyukt prerak yojanaon ko taiyaar karnaa evam shram laagat kaa nirdhaaran karnaa he
 For example, it was decided by repeated observations that an employee's standard time to prepare a card board box is 20 minutes
 is prakaar se ek ghante main vah teen bakse taiyaar karegaa
 Assuming that a worker works for 8 hours in an innings
 jisamen se ek ghanta dopaher ke bhojan evam aaraam kaa nikaal dete hai
 In this way, at the rate of three boxes per hour, he will prepare twenty-one boxes in seven hours of work
 ab yah ek karmi kaa maanak kaary hua
 Wages will be determined accordingly
 koi bhi vyakti kaary karte-karte shaareerik rup se evam maansik rup se thakaan anubhav karne lagegaa
 From time to time, the person will regain the internal force and will be able to work with the former capacity
 isse utpaadakta main vruddhi hogi
 Fatigue studies determine the duration and frequency of rest intervals to complete a task
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi sanyantr main saamanytah aath ghante kii ek pari ke hisaab se teen pariyon main kaary hota he
 If the work is being done in an innings, then the worker will have to give some rest time for food etc
 yadi kaary baari shaareerik shram vaala he to shramik ko kai baar thodi-thodi avadhi kaa aaraam dena hoga
 So that his energy is compensated and he can make his maximum contribution
 thakaan ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai jaise lambey kaary ke ghante, anupyukt kaary karnaa, apane adhikari se sambandhon main maadhurya kii kami athwa kaary kii kharaab paristhitiyaan aadi
 Obstacles to good performance should be removed
 tailor vibhedatmak paarishramik pranali kaa jabardast pakshdhar tha
 He wanted to differentiate between skilled and unskilled artisans
 maanak avadhi evam anya maandand kaa upar varnit kaary-adhyayan ke aadhaar par nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 Artisans can be divided into skilled and unskilled classes based on these standards
 vah chahta tha ki kushal karmchaariyon ko paritoshik milanaa chahie
 Therefore, he started different wage rates to complete standardized works and different from standardized wages
 udhaaharan ke liye yah nirdhaarit kiya gaya ki maanak utpaadan prativyakti pratidin 10 ikai he evam jo is maanak ko praapt kar lenge athwa isse adhik kaary karenge unako 50 rupye prati ikai se mazdooree milegi jabaki isse neeche kaary karne par 40 rupye prati ikai se mazdooree praapt hogi
 Thus a skilled worker would get paid 11 × 50 = 550 rupees per day while an unskilled employee who designed the unit would get 9 × 40 = 360 rupees per day
 tailor ke anusaar 190 rupye kaa antar ek akushal karmchaaree ke liye kaary ko or adhik shreshthata se karne ke liye paryaapt abhiprerak he
 From his own experience, Taylor cites the example of an employee named "abycup" who worked at Bethlehem Steel
 usne, vaigyanik prabandh kii takneekon ke anusaar kaary karte hue pratidin box-car main kachche lohe ke ladaan main 12-5 ton prati vyakti pratidin se badhaakar 47 ton prativyakti pratidin vruddhi kar di jisase aay main 1-15 dollar se 1-85 dollar vruddhi hone se 60 pratishat kii vruddhi hui
 It will be important to revisit the techniques of scientific management once again as this efficiency is integrated by integrating all the methods of Taylor
 kaarykushalta kii khoj ke liye ek sarvshereshth paddati kii khoj kerani hoti he tathaa chayan kii gai paddati din ke uchit kaary ke nirdhaaran main sahaayak hoti he
 There should be a system of compensation to treat those who have completed the proper work of the day or have done more than that
 yah vibhedatmak paddati is dharna par aadhaarit honi chahie ki kaarykushalta prabandhak evam shramik donon ke sanyukt praytn kaa parinaam hoti he
 Therefore, they should not dispute the share of surplus, but instead cooperate to increase production instead of limiting the production
 spasht he ki tailor ke vichaaron kaa saar / vaigyanik prabandh ke takanic evam siddhanton ke alag-alag varnan main nahin he, balki maansik dharna ke parivartan main he jise ‘maansik kranti’ kehete hai
 Mental revolution is the change in behavior of employees and management towards each other, that is, cooperation in place of competition
 donon ko samajhnaa chahie ki unhen ek duusare kii aavashyaktaa he donon ke lakshya aadhiky main vruddhi karnaa hona chahie
 This will not require any kind of movement
 prabandh ko aadhiky ke kuch bhaag ko karmchaariyon ke bich baantna chahie
 Employees should also exert their full power so that the company makes maximum profit
 yah drushtikon donon paksh evam company ke hit main hoga
 In the long run only the well being of the employees will ensure the prosperity of the business
 ham vaigyanik prabandh kii vartmaan sthiti kii bhi jaanch kar sakate hai
 In the present era, many new techniques have been developed in order of scientific management
 yuddh saamagree kii adhiktam tainaati ke liye parichaalan anusandhan kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 Similarly, Taylor discovered a gradual combination that was successfully used by Ford Motor Company in manufacturing the 'model T' for the masses
 is avadharana kaa ab bahut adhik prayog ho rahaa he
 a new development in scientific management is manufacturing
 aajkal utpaadan evam anya vyavsaayik gatividhiyon main robots evam computer kaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 This is the scientific form of management of these activities
 isse utpaadan str main vruddhi hui he
 Techniques of operational research have been developed and are being used due to scientific management

 It is called Priyamvand in Sanskrit

 Anand Vihar railway station, station code ANVT, which is a large railway station, is located in the East Delhi district of Delhi, the capital of India
 yah dilli prabhag ke prashasnic niyantran main aata he
 And there is also Anand Vihar Metro Station and 'vivekanand Bus Terminal' located on the Blue Line of the Delhi Metro
 yahan par parking kii bhi suvidha uplabdh he
 The station was formally inaugurated on 19 December 2009 by Union Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee, and former Delhi Chief Minister Smt
 Sheela Dixit
 42 hectares main failaa yah terminal sabase bade railway steshnon main se ek he
 The city of Delhi is completely dependent on railways for transport and transportation of passengers from one place to another and for importing and exporting goods
 dilli se lambii duuri kii railgadiyaan teen steshnon se chalaa karti thi namat: dilli jankshan, nai dilli or hazrat nizamuddin
 These stations did not have the basic facilities to handle such a large crowd of passengers
 punjab, haryana, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand or jammu va kashmir jaise uttari rajyon ke liye dilli ek sampark jodne vaala stesan he
 Keeping in view the increasing number of passengers in the existing stations, Northern Railway has identified the need for additional major passenger terminals
 dilli se purv kii ore uttar pradesh, bihar, urisa, pashchim bengal, jharkhand or anya purvottar rajyon ke liye chalane vaali railgadiyon ko yamuna nadi par bana pul paar karnaa padataa he kyonki sabhi teenon stesan nadi ke us paar sthit hai
 Thus the Anand Vihar area was chosen for the construction of a large railway terminal in the state beyond the Yamuna
 or varsh 2003 main kendriya rail mantri nitish kumaar ne ghoshnaa kii ki dilli ko anand vihaar main ek nayaa rail terminal milegaa
 The new terminal was developed to reduce congestion from New Delhi Railway Station, Delhi Junction and Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station
 terminal navi mumbai ke washi kii tarj par taiyaar kiya gaya he
 The new terminal has also helped in reducing congestion on the streets of the city, reducing the number of millions of people visiting Delhi daily
 railway terminal ko anand vihaar antarraji bas terminal or nazadik hi sthit dilli metro ke anand vihaar metro stesan ke saath joda gaya he, isprakaar yah dilli ke pramukh parivahan centre ke rup main parivartit ho gaya he
 In addition, the railway over bridge at Anand Vihar is planned to be widened as the existing bridge structure is not capable of handling traffic

 When the planning of this city started, it was decided that the confluence of Ramganga and Kosi rivers be made here
 devataaon ne turant gagas nadi se ramganga or kosi ko isaki soochna dene ko kaha, lekin gagas, jo har samay jaldi main rahati thi, usne swayan naa jaakar ek simal ke ped ko ramganga ke paas, or ek anya doot ko kosi ke paas bheja, parantu ve donon vahaan samay par naa pahunch sake
 The Semal tree fell asleep resting on a walk while walking, and by the time she woke up, Ramganga had reached Givad
 doosraa doot bhi dahi khaane ke chakkar main samay par kosi ke paas nahin pahunch paaya
 For this reason, Dwarahat could never become the capital of any state in history

 Omprakash gets two opportunities to approach Shantipriya
 pehla film 'drimigirl' ke premier par, jahaan om or pappu chaalaaki se ghus jate hai
 Another on the set of the film where Om saves Shanti from fire by playing on her life
 tab se om or shanti achche dost ban jate hai
 One day Om listens to the peace dispute with top producer Mukesh Mehra
 om ko yah jaanakar jhatka lagata he ki shanti mukesh se gupachup shaadi kar chuki he or garbhvatee he
 Mukesh is determined to keep his relations with Shanti a secret until his new film 'om Shanti Om' is completed
 shanti ko yah shaq he ki mukesh ek dhani vyavsaayee kii beti se vivaah kii yojana bana rahaa he
 She demands Mukesh his rights
 sab sunakar om kaa dil tut jaataa he
 One night, Mukesh takes Shanti to the set of the film 'om Shanti Om'
 vah kahata he ki vah film ko band kar degaa or saare samaaj ke saamne shanti se vivaah kar legaa
 But it turns out to be a trick of Mukesh
 vah shanti ko apni vittiya haani kaa kaaran samajhataa he
 So he sets the set on fire and leaves Shanti to die there
 om shanti ko bachaane kaa prayaas karata he par mukesh ke guard use aisa karne nahin dete
 Om falls away from the explosion and falls under a car

 On seeing him, Om remembers all the things of past life clearly

 Om Kapoor makes a plan together with Pappu, Bella and other companions to avenge Shanti's death
 om mukesh se tay karata he ki ve donon phir se 'om shanti om' film kaa nirmaan karenge
 Then Om and his assistant seek Shantipriya's lookalike
 unhen sandhyaa yaa 'sandy" naam kii yuvati milti he jo dekhne main shantipriya ke samaan or 'o ke' kii divaani he
 And then their plan begins - Om plays games with Mukesh
 sandy shanti ke rup main mukesh ke samane baar baar aati he
 Mukesh thinks that he is the soul of peace and starts to fear
 lekin phir ek din mukesh jaan jaataa he ki yah yuvati koi or he, shanti nahin
 He becomes alert
 ant main set par om or mukesh main hathapayee hoti he
 Om states that he was witness to the killing of Shanti by Mukesh in his previous birth
 mukesh use chunauti detaa he ki purvajanm kii baat par koi bhi adaalat vishwaas nahin karegi
 Just then, a young woman in the guise of peace comes there and says that just below the chandelier on the set, the proof of murder is buried - her body, which Mukesh had buried alive under the ground
 vah om ko mukesh par waar karne se roak detii he
 a heavy chandelier falls down and Mukesh gets subdued by it
 duusari ore se pappu ke saath sandy kamare main aa jaati he
 Om then realizes that Sandi, not the one who spoke the evidence, was the soul of the real Shantipriya, who avenged his killer
 shanti kii aatma om ko karun drushti se dekhakar muskuraati he or ojhal ho jaati he

 Industrial processes play a major role in large industries
 Most processes make the production of an otherwise rare material vastly cheaper in price, thus changing it into a commodity; i
e
 the process makes it economically feasible for society to use the material on a large scales, in machinery, or a substantial amount of raw materials, in comparison to batch or craft processes
 Production of a specific material may involve more than one type of process
 Most industrial processes result in both a desired product and by-products, many of which are toxic, hazardous, or hard to deal with
 Very, very few processes are self-contained
 These may be applied on their own, or as part of a larger process
 The availability of electricity and its effect on materials gave rise to several processes for plating or separating metals
 There are several physical processes for reshaping a material by cutting, folding, joining or polishing, developed on a large scale from workshop techniques
 The physical shaping of materials by forming their liquid form using a mould
 Many materials exist in an impure form, purification, or separation provides a usable product
 Early production of iron was from meteorites, or as a by-product of copper refining
 Heating iron ore and carbon in a crucible at 1000 k produces wrought iron
 This process gained popularity during the Iron Age
 Temperatures of 1300 k were produced around the 8th century by blowing air through the heated mixture in a bloomery or blast furnace ; producing a strong but brittle cast iron
 Furnaces were growing bigger, producing greater quantities; a factor contributing to the Industrial Revolution
 In 1740 the temperature and carbon content could be controlled sufficiently to consistently produce steel; very strong and very workable
 The 19th century saw the development of electric arc furnaces that produced steel in very large quantities, and are more easily controlled

 Chandrabhanu Gupta's political career began in 1926
 He was made a member of Uttar Pradesh Congress and All India Congress Committee
 Chandrabhanu had made his mark in the Congress in a very short time as soon as he entered politics
 He immediately became the Treasurer, Vice President and President of the UP Congress
 In the election of 1937, he was elected a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 Then in the first state government formed in 1946 after independence, he joined Govindballabh Pant's cabinet as Parliamentary Secretary
 He then worked as a minister of several departments from 1948 to 1959
 In 1960, he was made the Chief Minister of UP
 At that time, he was an MLA from Ranikhet South
 Politics had become very complicated when Sampurnanand was the Chief Minister
 Many factions were formed in the Congress
 In such a situation, Sampurnanand was made the Governor of Rajasthan and Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of UP
 Meanwhile, Gupta's stature had increased a lot in UP politics
 Becoming the Chief Minister was a landslide victory over all types of opposition
 This created panic among the leaders of the Center
 This was the period when the Congress people started challenging Nehru's power at the Center
 Chandrabhanu was not completely influenced by Nehru's socialism
 So Nehru did not like them
 But in the UP Congress, Chandrabhanu was so angry that the mlas were first bowed down in front of Chandrabhanu, and later in front of Nehru
 Nehru not like this In 1963, k Kamaraj advised Nehru that all Congress chief ministers, except a few people, should be designed
 So that state governments can be re-organized
 It was said that leave the post for a few days
 Have to work for the party
 But in Chandrabhanu's eyes, it was that all this game is happening so that the one whom Nehru does not like, he should leave
 They declined
 But they were convinced that it was a matter of a few days
 You will be made Chief Minister again
 But this did not happen
 Under the Kamaraj plan, Chandrabhanu had to step down on the dictum of ideals
 This was a very Democratic war of dictatorship over democracy
 The elected leader had to step down due to dislike
 Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh thrice
 From 1960 to 1963
 But even after leaving the post of Chief Minister, he remained an influence in politics
 a matter of luck
 He again became the Chief Minister after winning the 1967 election
 But this time for only 19 days
 Same luck again
 Farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh broke the Congress and formed his party
 Chandrabhanu's government went
 Charan Singh became Chief Minister
 But they could not run the government
 That government also fell
 And Chandrabhanu Gupta was re-appointed as Chief Minister in a hurry in 1969
 He remained in this position for almost a year
 Then something happened that changed the Congress forever
 The Congress party broke up in 1969
 This was not an internal issue of UP
 This time the breakdown took place at the center level
 In a syndicate group led by Indira Gandhi and Kamaraj
 Everyone thought that Indira would be a puppet in her hands
 But Indira turned out to be the biggest politician
 There was a dispute between the two factions about the President
 Morarji Desai turned out to be a strong opponent of Indira
 Chandrabhanu Gupta went to Morarji Camp
 But this camp lost
 VV Giri became President with the support of Indira
 It was here that the career of most of the leaders of the syndicate got a break
 Chandrabhanu's career ended
 But it's a matter of time Morarji also became Prime Minister
 Chandrabhanu was offered a position in the cabinet
 But Chandrabhanu's health had deteriorated
 It was not appropriate to take the post of minister
 They declined
 He died on 11 March 1980

 vatting for godot shamooel baket dwaara rachit ek betuka naatak he, jisamen do mukhya paatr vladimir or estrogan ek anya kaalpanik paatr godot ke aane kii antaheen va nishphal pratiksha karte hai
 Since the premiere of this drama, many interpretations have been made about the absence of Godot and other aspects
 ise "beesvin sadi kaa sabase prabhaavshaalee angreji bhashaa kaa naatak" bhi bulaayaa ja chukaa he
 In fact, Waiting for Godot Beckett is his own English translation of the French drama En Attendant Godot and has been given the subtitle of a two-part tragedy-comedy in English "
 9 October 1948 and Done between 29 January 1949
 iskaa stage premier 5 janvari 1953 ko paris ke theatre di babilon naamak theatre main hua
 It was produced by Roger Blinn, who also played the role of Pozzo in it
 vatting for godot donon mukhya paatro ke jivan ke do dinon kaa varnan he, jahaan ve donon kisi godot naam ke vyakti ke aagaman kii vyarth va nishphal pratiksha kar rahe hai
 They say that they know him, but they themselves say that if he comes, they will not recognize him, this proves that he does not recognize him
 To keep themselves busy in this wait, they do all the work like eating, sleeping, debating, playing games, exercising, changing hats among themselves and even contemplating suicide i
e
 That "dreadful silence may be kept away"
 naatak kii shuruyaat main estrogan apane paanv se juuta nikaalane kaa vifal prayaas kar rahaa he
 He mumbles "there's nothing to do"
 Holding this sentence, Vladimir begins to think, as if 'nothing' is really something big that he has to do throughout the play
 jab estrogan juuta nikaalane main safal ho jaataa he to vah uske bheetar jhaankta he, tathaa vahaan kuch nahin paata
 isse thik purv vladimir apane hat main jhaankta he
 This pattern is repeated throughout the play
 donon mukhya paatr naatak ke dauraan pashchaatap kii baat karte hai, jisamen ve prabhu yishu ke saath cross par taange gaye donon choron kaa zikr karte hai
 It also discusses that only one in four more jalists told that one of the two thieves was saved
 yah charchaa naatak ke dauraan bible se sambandhit anek charchaaon main se ek thi, jo naatak main pratyaksh hoti he
 This shows that the original and hidden subject of the play is God-union and nirvana
 jab-jab donon mukhya paatro ko lagata he godot nikat hai to ve khushi se chilla uthte hai, 'ham batch gaye'
 Vladimir is periodically enraged by Estragon's dialogue ineptitude
 udhaaharan ke liye vah kahata he "are gogo tum kam se kam ek baar to gend vaapis meri ore bhej sakate ho?" bhav se vah estrogan athwa gogo ko apni samvaad kaala sudhaarney ko prerit kar rahaa he
 Gogo seems to struggle in the dialogue arts throughout the play, and Vladimir leads him in dialogue between their mutual and other people
 bich-bich main vladimir gogo ke prati apana aapa bhi kho detaa he, parantu adhiktar donon main ghanishthata rahati he jiskaa pramaan unke maitreepurn aalingan va ek duusare kaa samarthan karne main pratyaksh ho jaataa he
 Estragon looks at the viewing gallery and asks if there is a colorless atmosphere
 vah vahaan se dur janaa chahta he, parantu use yaad dilaayaa jaataa he ki ve pratiksha kar rahe hai
 However, both characters are unable to agree that the time and place of Godot's meeting is today and now
 unako yahan tak spasht nahin he ki aaj koun sa din he
 Time is either interrupted or fragmented throughout the play, or does not exist at all
 saare uplakshya main unhen keval ek baat kaa purnagyaan he ki ve ek ped ke nikat milane vaale hai
 That tree is close by
 estrogan so jaataa he parantu vladimir use nahin uthaata kyonki vah nahin chahta ki gogo uth kar apane sapanom ke vrittant se use bor kare
 estrogan uthta he or kisi veshyaghar vaala koi purana haasyaaspad kissa sunanaa chahta he jise vladimir sunaanaa shuru karata he parantu bich main hi use prashaadhan vyavdhaan lenaa padataa he
 When he returns, he abandons this anecdote in the middle and asks Estragon what else he should do to spend time
 Estragon proposes that they can hang on the cross, but the idea is abandoned thinking that if one of the two survived, the life of one would be very painful
 In the end, both choose a safe path to do nothing
 estrogan kahata he "yahi surakshit maarg he", or poochta he jab godot aayga to vah kya karegaa
 is par ek baar ke liye vladimir ko bhi kuch nahin sujhata or vah keval itnaa hi kah paata hai: "kuch pakkaa nahin he"
 When Estragon says that he is hungry, Vladimir gives him a carrot
 estrogan ko vah adhik pasand to nahin aati parantu kha letaa he
 This way of spending time also ends and Estragon says we have nothing to do
 donon paatro ke intjaar main ek nayaa mode aata he jab pojo va uskaa bhaar se ladaa das lucky vahaan se guzarate hai
 Lucky's arrival is announced with "a painful cry"
 uski gardan main rassi bandhi he
 He crosses half the stage after which Pojo is seen holding the other end
 pojo apane das lucky par khub chillaata he tathaa use "boar" kahkar pukaarata he, parantu vah estrogan or vladimir ke prati sabhy he
 These two first consider themselves as Godot and do not pay attention to his obstinate and rude behavior
 Pozo gets a little irritated when he considers Godot
 vah unako bataata he ki "sadak par sabhi kaa samaan adhikaar" he
 After this Pozo contemplates relaxation by consuming chicken and alcohol
 jab vah khaakar haddiyaan phenkane lagata he to estrogan unki ore lapakata he
 This makes Vladimir feel very remorseful
 pojo kahata he ki yah haddiyaan lucky ke liye he tathaa estrogan ko lucky se poochna hoga
 estrogan lucky se poochta he or lucky chup rahakar munh jhukaa letaa he
 Assuming it to be "no", Estragon acquires bones
 vladimir pojo ko lucky ke prati nirdayatapurna vyavhaar ke liye pratadit karata he, parantu pojo us par dhyaan nahin detaa
 donon mukhya paatr lucky se poochhate hai ki jab pojo usase koi or kaary nahin karvaa rahaa hota to lucky apana boj neeche kyon nahin rakh detaa
 yah sunakar pojo kahata he ki lucky use prasann karne kii cheshtaa main he, taaki vah use punah na bech de
 yah sunakar lucky rone lagata he
 Pozo hands her the handkerchief, but as Estragon tries to wipe her tears, Lucky bruises on her ankles
 jane se pehle pojo kahata he ki uskaa man bahalane ke liye vah unako kya de saktaa he
 Estragon asks for money, on which Vladimir is a bit angry and says that Pozo will allow Lucky to think a little and dance
 lucky kaa naach purna tathaa avyavasthit hota he
 His "thinking" began with Vladimir placing a cap on his head, only the meaningless dialogue of a man suddenly awakened from sleep
 lucky kaa ekalaap aarambh main to kuch thik hota he parantu baad main purnataya samaj se pare ho jaataa he or vah tabhi ho saktaa he jab vladimir apni hat uske sir se hataa letaa he
 Lucky becomes a slave back and starts packing things as ordered
 pojo or lucky chale jate hai
 At the end of both parts of the play comes a boy who is supposed to be the messenger of Godot
 vah kahata he ki "godot aaj shaam nahin par kal avashya aayega
" vaartalap main vladimir ladke se poochta he ki kya vah kal bhi aayaa tha, jisase pataa chalata he ki donon paatr anant samay se godot ke intjaar main hai or yah bhavishya main bhi anant samay tak chalata rahegaa
 ladke ke jane ke baad vah bhi jane kaa sochate hai parantu is prati koi prayaas nahin karte
 aisa donon bhaagon ke ant main hota he, pardaa girtaa he
 The second part begins with Vladimir humming the song, which relates to a dog and has a broad knowledge of the purpose of the play
 is geet se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki naatak main paramparaagat sangeet, manoranjan va utsav kaa vaataavaran he
 This play is only one of the references and examples related to the Kukkur caste
 isse yah bhi maaloom ho jaataa he ki vladimir ko is aashay kaa abhas he ki jis duniya main vah ulajhaa he, vah utsavmay he 
 vah yah samajhane lagata he ki yadhyapi uski duniya main nishchit samroop vikaas ke kuch pramaan hai tathaapi vah multah nijee jivan ke diwason ko tathaavat doharaa rahaa he
 Concerning the song of Vladimir, Eugene Webb wrote: "the period of the song is not uniformly moving, but it is symbolic of the endless situation whose only eternal end is: death"
 ek baar punah estrogan kahata he ki usne raat ek khai main bitaai or "10 logon ne" peeta - upar se haalanki use koi chot kaa nishaan nahin he
 Vladimir tells him about the seasonal changes happening in the tree and also about the activities of the previous day, but Estragon does not remember much
 Vladimir takes the names of Pozo and Lucky but Estragon only remembers bones and ankle pain
 vladimir ko dhyaan aata hai ki yadi estrogan apni taang dikhaae to use yaad aa saktaa he
 With great difficulty Estragon shows the leg on which the wound has now deepened
 vladimir ko ahsaas hota he ki estrogan ne koi juute nahin pahane hue hai
 The carrot is finished, so Vladimir tells Estragon to choose turnip and radish
 estrogan muuli chunata he parantu kaala hone kii vajah se lautaa detaa he
 Estragon then attempts to sleep in a state equivalent to the previous day's fetus
 Vladimir tells him Lori
 vladimir ko lucky vaali hat najar aati he or vah use pahanane kii sochataa he
 This starts a hat change process
 ve pojo or lucky kaa anusaran karne kii koshish karte hai, parantu estrogan ko kuch bhi yaad nahin aata ki vah pojo va lucky se mila bhi tha ki nahin
 vah bas keval vladimir ke adeshon kaa paalan karata jaataa he
 They both abuse each other and then make up
 uske baad ve kuch shaareerik jatke va ek yogasana karne kaa prayaas karte hai parantu donon vifal ho jate hai
 Pojo and Lucky arrive again
 pojo andhaa ho chukaa he or kahata he ki lucky goonga he
 The rope is now quite short and Lucky is now in the leading guiding role instead of Pozo
 pojo samay kaa abhas kho chukaa he tathaa kahata he ki use nahin yaad ki vah pichley din estrogan va vladimir se mila tha
 He also says that even today's activities will not be remembered tomorrow
 ek samay to sabhi ek ke upar ek gir padate hai
 Estragon thinks this is his chance to avenge being fired and killed by Lucky
 is par lambii charchaa hoti he
 Pozo offers to give them the money, but Vladimir thinks that the mind of both of them is exasperating and both of them are forced to join them in waiting for Godot
 ant main haalanki sab uth khadey hote hai
 Pozo was a proud man in Part 1, but now he has matured a little after blindness
 uske jane ke baad vladimir uske antim shabdon kii vyakhya karata he: "janm kaa sthaan bhi kisi shavgrih ke paas hi hota he, ek kshan kii roshni hoti he phir raat ho jaati he"
 Lucky and Pozo go away
 vahi ladkaa phir aata he or doharaata he aaj godot kii pratiksha naa karen parantu kal vah avashya aayega
 is par niraashaa main donon estrogan kii belt se latak kar aatmahatya kaa prayaas karte hai parantu donon ke bhaar se vah tut jaati he
 Estragon's paint drops but he does not know until Vladimir tells him
 They decide that they will bring a strong rope tomorrow and attempt suicide again, if Godot does not come
 ve phir jane kaa nirnay karte hai parantu iskaa koi prayaas nahin karte
 Beckett has not shed much light on the characters except in the stream of the play
 baket ne kaha tha ki ek baar jab sar ralf richardsan ne apane atyant prabhaavshaalee dhang se pojo, vladimir va anya paatro ke vishay main vistrut jaankaree maangi thi
 Then they just said that
 


 ki inke bare main jo naatak main likhaa he ve keval vahi jaanate hai
 "if i wanted to know more, i would have written in the drama before and this is applicable to all the characters
 " When Beckett started writing the play, there was no image of Vladimir and Estragon in his mind
 na hi usne kahin unako nimna bataaya yaa dikhaaya he
 Roger Blinn explained: "beckett used to hear their voices, but was unable to describe his characters
 vah kahata tha]: 'ki mujhe keval ek baat pataa he ki donon mukhya paatr bowler hai
 "'" Bowler Hat was a popular men's garment in Beckett's hometown foxrock
 bachapan main uski maan usko berat pahanane par tokati thi tathaa bowler hat pahanane ko prerit karti thi jo baket ke pita bhi pahana karte the
 " donon paatro kii shaareerik sanrachana ke vishay main bhi kuch bhi nahin likhaa gaya he; haalanki aisa prathit hota he ki vladimir donon main adhik baari tha
 The impact of Laurel and Hardy becomes apparent to modern audiences as compared to Baller Hat and other ridiculous aspects
 'di comic mind: kamedi and di movies naamak lekh main gerold mast ne is bare main likhaa 'sachai ko paroksh rup main dikhaane ke liye nae praaroop kaa prayog'
 baad main baket ke 1953 main chape apane anya upanyaas wat main laurel va hardi par vishesh tippanee kii
 us upanyaas main baket ne ek swasth jhaadi ko 'ek hardi laurel' yaa 'ek majboot laurel' kah kar sambodhit kiya
 Vladimir stands in almost all the drama while Estragon often sits and falls asleep
 "estrogan shant he jab ki vladimir baichaiyn
" vladimir akaash kii ore dekhakar dharmik va darshanik vishyon ke bare main sochataa he
 On the other hand, Estragon is entangled in everyday things like ordinary men
 vah khaane va dard dur karne jaisi baton se zyada upar nahin ja paata
 vah thodaa bhulakkad bhi he parantu vladimir ke yaad dilaane par use yaad bhi aa jaataa he
 For example, Vladimir asked him "do you remember the Gospel?" On this, Estragon says that he remembers the colored map of that holy place and was about to celebrate his honeymoon on the Dead Sea
 vastav main uski laghu avadhi kii smriti kamjor thi or shaayad vah aljahaimar se peedit tha
 On the other hand, Al Alvarez writes: "perhaps this forgetfulness helped the two to remain friends
 estrogan bhuulataa he, vladimir yaad dilaataa he tathaa is tarah samay vyateet ho jaataa he
 Both of them have been together for fifty years but when Pozo asked, they refused to give their age
 vladimir ke jivan main bhi anek ksht hai parantu vah donon main sakht jaan he
 "vladimir's pain is mental though
 isiilie vah lucky se bhi apana hat badal letaa he kyonki vah dusron se vichaar vimarsh karnaa chahta he
 " pur naatak ke dauraan donon ek duusare ko "didi" va "gogo" kah kar sambodhit karte hai, haalanki ek ladke ne vladimir ko bhi "mistar albert" kah kar pukaara
 baket ne aarambh main estrogan ke liye levi naam chunaa tha, parantu pojo ke poochne par vah apana naam "magaragore aadre" bataata he
 At the same time, he continued to be called the French name "katule" or "cutule", especially in the earlier "faber edition"
 In the American version it became "adam"
 baket ne keval itnaa kaha ki ve "katulas se ub" gaye the
 a critic named Vivian Mercer said that the drama Waiting for Godot set the record for making an impossible seeming thing possible
 ek naatak jisamen kuch nahin ghatata, magar phir bhi darshak ekagra hokar ise dekhte hai
 Not only this, the second part is a slightly different form of the first part, so Beckett has written a wonder where nothing happens twice
 "- The newspaper questioned and wrote the language of the two main characters in this edition
 "perhaps Beckett sarcastically, how can you say that he is a ph
d
 Are not? 'how do you know that he has ph
d
 Haven't done it? ' His reply was "they must have had a good past, though only known, they had once gone to the Eiffel Tower, and once to the vineyard on the banks of the Rhys River
 The first theatrical staging, which Beckett himself monitored, featured the two chiefs
 The clothes of the characters are not dirty, but a bit ordinary
 udhar estrogan dwaara bag va haddiyaan maangane par vladimir thodaa bhadak jaataa he jisase gyaat hota he ki use vyavhaar uchit hone kaa abhas rahata tha
 " haalanki baket ne paatro kii prishthbhumi ke vishay main kuch nahin likhaa parantu naatak main kaam karne vaale abhinaytaon ne apni-apni prerana talash lee he
 Marthe Gottier, a doctor friend of Jean Martin's, used to work at Salpatrière Hospital and Martin asked her: "listen, Marthur, where can you find a description and explanation of this play that speaks of a certain voice?" Told: In this disease, the hands, feet of the patient start to tremble and slowly he cannot even speak without trembling
 i then said that i want this
 Beckett and Rajar were a little less confident but still agreed
 "jab martin ne baket se kaha ki ve lucky ke paatr ko ek parkisns marij kii tarah karenge to baket ne kaha "avashya"
 baket ne yah zikr bhi kiya ki marco kii yahi beemaari thi
 But then soon the subject changed
 " jab baket se poocha gaya ki lucky kaa naam aisa kyon rakhaa gaya to unhone kaha ki vah "lucky bhaagyashaalee he ki uski koi aakankshaayen role nahin he" Some assessments even state that because "DD and Gogo's relationship was not fully described or established", Lucky and Pozo are one of them
 pojo or lucky ke rishte main pojo kaa prabhutv asal main bemaani tha
 It is known from careful observation that Lucky's influence was always greater
 vah naachata tha or pojo ke khalipan ko dur karne ko sochataa bhi tha
 So from the first time Pozo was actually a slave of Lucky
 yah baat pojo bhi sweekaar karata he ki lucky ne use samskruti, vinay or tarkshiltaa pradaan kii he
 His curiosity came naturally
 pojo kaa party vrittant ek acha udhaaharan he: jab uski smriti jaati rahati he to vah is vakrapatutaa ko bhi kho detaa he
 The only thing known about Pojo is that he was going to the fair to sell his slave Lucky
 vah swany ko ucch koti kaa jameendaar maanata he jab ki vah keval ek ghamandi va swaarthee vyakti he jo dusron se asabhy vyavhaar karata he
 His pipe is made by Dublin's most famous tobacco company, Cap & Peterson
 Pozo called his pipe "briar", while Estragon showed him the "dudin" and the social and economic differences between the two
 pojo apni smriti kuch kamjor maanata tha parantu aisa isliye tha kyonki vah swalin rahata tha
 In Beckett's words "pozo suffered from an insecure mindset
 isiilie vah har vishay main bad chadh kar vaad-vivaad karata tha or har kaary main bhi aisa hi vyavhaar karata tha
 Pozo controlled Lucky with a long rope and jerked the rope harder when Lucky was too slow
 lucky purnataya uske kabje main tha tathaa ek "vafaadaar kute kii tarah" uski naikari bajaata tha
 "he did not hesitate to carry a heavy burden on his back
 saare naatak main lucky sirf ek baar bolta he, vah bhi tab jab pojo use vladimir va estrogan ke liye sochane ko kahata he
 Pozo and Lucky have been together for sixty years and their relationship has deteriorated significantly during this period
 lucky sadaa pojo se budhimaan tha parantu aayu ke saath vah ghrinaa kaa paatr ban gaya
 His "thinking" is his intelligence and his inferior "dance" is a cruel sign of old age
 pojo ke krur vyavhaar ke baavjood lucky sadaa uskaa vafaadaar rahaa
 duusare bhaag main bhi jab pojo achaanak andhaa ho jaataa he, lucky uskaa saath nahin chodta or maardarshak banataa he
 Their relationship value is more than a rope joint just as DD and Gogo are connected through "godot's Fantasy"
 america nirdeshak alan shnider ko baket ne yahi kaha tha: " ek manorogi he or uskaa paatr abhinit karne ke liye abhinayta ko thodaa paagalpan kaa put nihit karnaa hoga
" "in the translation of the play 


 Beckett continued to try to incorporate all the French things and added all the English names and places to Lucky
 Beckett believed that the name Lucky had a strong connection to English
 " The characters mention only one boy
 pehle bhaag main ek sthaneey ladkaa vladimir ko aashwast karata he ki vah didi ko pehali baar dekh rahaa he or vah kal nahin aayaa tha
 He reveals that he grazes goats for Mr
 Godot
 yah bhi kahata he ki uskaa bhai jise godot khub peethta he, bhed charaata he
 However Godot provides food to both and also allows them to live in their pasture
 bhaag do main ladkaa vladimir ko aashwast karata he ki pichley din aane vaala vyakti vah nahin tha, yah uskaa pehla aagaman he
 When Vladimir asks him what Godot does, the boy says, "sir, nothing
" The boy also says that Godot probably has a white beard
 baton main ladke ke ek biimaar bhai kaa bhi zikr aata he parantu yah spasht nahin ho paata ki yah bhai bhaag ek vaala hi ladkaa he yaa koi anya
 There have been many debates over the identity of Godot
 "jab colin dakworth ne baket se sidhe poocha ki kya pojo hi godot he to baket ne uttar diya: 'nahin
 aisa prathit hota he parantu yah asaty he
 "' "jab roger blin ne poocha ki godot ke paatr kaa kya paryaay he to baket ne kaha ki iskaa udgam juuton ke liye french apshabd godillo, godase se hua he kyonki pairon kaa naatak main ahm sthaan he
 Beckett used to explain this mostly about Godot
 " "once Beckett told Peter Woodthorp that he now regrets having named the character Godot because many viewers have created many misconceptions by linking it to God or God
 "maine richardsan se kaha ki agar meraa aashay bhagwaan se hota to main god hi naam rakhata godot nahin
 isse richardsan bahut niraash hue
" lekin baket ne ek baar yah bhi mana, "yadi main kahoon main godot shabd ke arth se waakif nahin hoon to yah vivekahin baat lagati he
 i know very well that many people consider it as a form of 'god' or God
 magar yaad rahe ki maine yah naatak french main likhaa tha or yadi yah khyaal meri upchetana main kahin tha bhi to pratyaksh main kabhi nahin aayaa
 "it was a funny statement because Beckett had said many times that the subconscious write with mind and even go into a trance-like state
 baket ke anya kaaryon kii tarah is naatak main koi cycle nahin haparantu hay kennar ne apane niabandh "di cartisian sentor" main likhaa he ki baket ne ek baar godot ke vishay par kaha tha ki godot ek vayovruddh cyclist he tathaa ganja va sadaa tikne vaala vyakti he
 Also, he is often seen as an official in national and city competitions
 uskaa pehla naam agyaat he parantu upnaam godiu he jiskaa uccharan godot hi he
 Although the play is not about the track cycle race, Beckett was an admirer of the French cyclist Rajar Gadot and had waited for him outside at the Rubel's velodrome
 donon ladakon main se ek hi pitayee se bachaa najar aata he, "baket bhi majaak main kehete hai, estrogan kaa ek pair batch gaya
 " britain va ireland main godot shabd ke uccharan main pratham shabdaansh par jor diya jaataa he, / ˈɡɒdoʊ / ; jabaki uttari america main duusare shabdaansh par, / ɡəˈdoʊ / 
 baket haalanki england vaale uccharan ko sahi maanate the
 It is silent
 ireland main janme paley baket ko irish bhashaa kaa acha gyaan tha
 In Irish Gaulik, "go dio" has two meanings "forever" and "for a long time"
 While writing, Beckett probably used the term from a somewhat sarcastic angle because he knew that English and French audiences would hardly understand those jargon
 donon krity main keval ek hi drishy he
 Two men are waiting near a tree on a native road
 purush anirdisht mul ke hai, haalanki yah spasht he ki rashtriyata kii drushti se ve angrej nahin he 
 script ke anusaar estrogan ek nichle tile par baithta he lekin vyaavhaarik drushti se - baket ke 1975 kii german film kii tarah - aam taur par yah ek pathar he
 The tree in the first digit is empty
 duusare ank main, kuch pattey dikhaai dete hai jabaki script ke anusaar yah aglaa din he
 Very few details are available to the mind "the idea of liu Vel which is a place which should not be given a detailed description"
 ek baar alan shnider ne naatak ko ek chakkar main daalane kaa suzav diya tha - pojo ko aksar ek ringamaster ke rup main ullikhit kiya gaya he - lekin baket ne unke vipareet paraamarsh diya: "apni anbhigyata kii drushti se main is chakra vaali baat se sahamat nahin hoon or mujhe lagata he ki godot ko ek bahut hi band bakse kii jarurat he
 "he also once expected the" foggy shadow of the stage floor bars "but eventually decided against this" disclosure "
 apane 1975 ke shiller theatre production main kuch had tak james nolsan ke vivaran main " jaal kii rassiyon main fansi hui pakshiyon kii tarah" didi or gogo kai baar uchhaalate hue dikhaai dete hai
 DD and Gogo are trapped only because they still cling to the concept that freedom is possible; Freedom is a state of mind like imprisonment
 baket ke anusaar is naatak kii prerana kaa ek strot casper david fredrick kii ek painting thi
 Ruby Cohan is lost in memories by seeing an 1824 painting with Beckett titled Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon, who "explicitly proclaims, 'you know, this was the source of Waiting for Godot
' '""ho saktaa he ki ve do paintingon ko lekar uljhan main pad gaye hon kyonki duusare maukon par unhone doston kaa dhyaan 1819 ke tu main contemplatting da moon kii taraf aakarshith kiya jisamen labaadaa pahane do purush ek sampoorn chaand ko dekh rahe the jo ek bade or bina pattiyon vaale ped kii kaali shakhaon se ghira hua tha
 "in both cases the painting was substantially the same, so their evaluation may apply equally to both
 haalanki kuch strot rucilon main sujen deschevox-dumesnil or baket ke bich hui baatcheet ko is kaary kii prerana maanate hai
 Beckett admitted this in a New York Post interview taken by Jerry Tallmer
 rubi kohan baket ke naatak lekhan kaa varnan "kaalpanik trayee ke uttarottar nirankush aantarikta ke ek palaayan" ke rup main karti hai - jiske liye vah baket ke moloy, melone dies or da ananameble kaa sandarbh prastut karti hai; baket ne daawa kiya he ki unhone "godot ke lekhan kaa armbh us samay swayan dwaara likhe ja rahe bhayankar gadhy se dur jane ke liye ek vishram ke rup main kiya tha
 " "chunki yah itnaa nirvastr, itnaa moulik he ki yah har tarah kii saamaajik or raajnneetik or dharmik vyakhya ko aamantrit karata he," normand berling ne sharad ritu 1999 ke ek naatak kii ek shradhanjali main likhaa tha, "jiske saath khud baket ko vibhinn sampradaayon ke vichaaron, vibhinn aandolanon or vichaarwaadon se joda gaya tha
 Attempts to explain him clearly have not been successful, but the desire to do so is natural when he encounters a writer whose minimalist art reaches a basic reality
 'kam' hamen 'adhik' kii talash karne ke liye majaboor karata he or godot or baket ke bare main baat karne kii jarurat ke parinamswaroop kitabon or lekhon kaa boj lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 " puure vatting for godot main pathak yaa darshak kaa saamana dharmik, darshanik, paaramparik, manovishleshnatmak or jivan sambandhi - khaas taur par yuddh ke samay ke - sandarbhon se ho saktaa he
 There are certain ritual aspects and elements that are directly derived from vaudeville and there is danger in making them more than they are: namely the mere structural features, the avatars in which the author establishes his fictional characters
 naatak main "kai theth roopon or paristhitiyon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he jinamein se sabhi apane aapako hasya or karuna donon main samahit karte hai
 "beckett makes this fact well evident in the opening notes of the film:" The above fact has nothing to do with any truth that has only been named a structural and dramatic feature
 " unhone yah kehete hue laurence harvey par ek or mahatvapurn tippanee kii ki "unka kaam anubhav par nirbhar nahin karata he - anubhav kaa record nahin he
 Of course you use it "
 baket "anant galatafahami" se turant thak gaye
 Long ago in 1955 he remarked that "I don't understand why people make a small thing so big
" " vah gupt suraagon se zyada kuch ummid nahin kar rahe the, haalaanki: "peter woodthrope ne ek din taxi main unase poocha ki naatak kis bare main tha: "yah sahjivita he, peter; yah sahjivita he,' baket ne jawaab diya
" Beckett directed the play for the Schiller Theater in 1975
 haalanki unhone kai prastutiyon kii dekharekh kii thi lekin aisa pehali hua tha ki is baar unhen sampoorn niyantran praapt hua tha
 Walter Asmus was his honest young assistant director
 yah production yaa prastuti prakritik nahin tha
 Beckett explained, yah ek khel he, sab kuch ek khel he
 When all four of them are on the ground, then it cannot be handled naturally
 He has to do it artificially, like a ballet
 nahin to sabakuch ek nakal, vaastaviktaa kii ek nakal ban jaati he 
 ise spasht or paardarshee hona chahie, na ki sookhaa
 yah jivit rahane ke liye khelaa jane vaala ek khel he
 " pichley kai saalon main baket ne spasht rup se yah mahasoos kiya ki kaaphi had tak godot kii kamyaabi is baat se sambandhit thi ki yah tarah-tarah ke pathan ke liye khulaa tha or yah anivaary rup se koi buree cheez nahin thi
 Beckett himself approved "one of Gadot's most famous mixed-race productions performed at the University of Cape Town's Baxter Theater, directed by Donald Howarth in which two black actors John Kani and Winston Natshona produced D
D
 Gogo played; Pojo and Lucky were played by two blond actors Bill Flynn and Peter Piccolo
 Redaction is often depicted as an explicit political presentation when in fact it was less heavily emphasized
 haalaanki aisi pratikriya dikhaai gai thi ki naatak ko kisi bhi tarah se ek raajnneetik roopak ke rup main nahin liya ja saktaa lekin phir bhi usamen kuch aise tatv hai jo kisi bhi sthaneey sthiti ke liye praasangik he jisamen ek vyakti ko duusare vyakti dwaara shoshit yaa pratadit kiya ja rahaa he
 " "ise sheet yuddh ke ek roopak ke rup main dekha gaya tha" yaa germanon ke prati francisi pratirodh ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 Customer Hasell writes that, "it seems that Pozo and Lucky's accession is nothing more than a metaphor for Ireland's view of Mainland Britain where society is still cursed by a greedy ruling elite while the working class is left passive and everything Is unaware of " Like the Beckett on Film project, the pair are often featured with an Irish accent
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki yah baket kii lay or shabd rachana kaa ek anivaary parinaam he lekin ise paath main nirdisht nahin kiya gaya he
 By no means are they part of the English repository: at one point in the play Estragon makes fun of the English pronunciation of the word "calm" and enjoys the "story of the Englishman in the brothel"
 "barnard deukor didi, gogo and da absent godot main ek trayee siddhant ko viksit karte hai jo sigmund frid ke da igo and da id main trimurti maanas vivaran or onomastic takanic ke upyog par aadhaarit he
 Ducor defines characters based on the absence of "rational go-go embodies the incomplete ego, the principle of missing happiness: go-go
 D-d - which is of a more natural nature and irrational - than the rational principle Backward is seen as ID or sabotage
 godot maha-ahankaar yaa naitik maanakon ke kaary ko puraa karata he
 Pozo and Lucky are mere repetitions of the main characters
 deukor ant main baket kii naatak ko manushya ke astitv kii nirarthakta ke ek roopak ke rup main dekhtaa he jab ek bahari antity se mukti kii ummid kii jaati he or khud ke aatmanirikshan se nakaar diya jaataa he
 "the four aspects of the soul or the four typical personalities are classified into two pairs: the ego and the shadow, the personality and the image of the soul
 The shadow is the character that contains all our petty feelings under the ego
 lucky, chaaya nirankush pojo, samrudh saamanyata kaa prototip, ke dhruviya vilom ke rup main kaary karata he jo uttarottar apane adhinsth ko niyantrit or tang karata he, is prakaar yah nirankush ahankaar se achet chaaya ke utpeedan kaa pratik he
 Lucky's monologue in the first issue appears as an example of a stream of repressed unconsciousness as he is allowed to "think" for his master
 sugandhit jadibuti taragon ke alaava estrogan ke naam kaa ek or matlab he: "estrogan" mahila hormone estrogen kaa ek sajaateey he 
 yah hamen vladimir kii aatma kii mahila chhavi enema kii pahchaan karne ke liye prerit karata he
 It tells of Estragon's poetic instincts, his sensibilities and dreams, his irrational moods
 vladimir poorak maradaana siddhant kii tarah yaa shaayad tarksangat vyaktitv ke manansheel prakaar ke rup main dikhaai detaa he
 It is widely said that existentialists think that there are some fundamental questions that every human being faces if they take their subjective existence seriously
 un sawaalon main mrityu, maanav astitv kaa arth or us astitv main ishwar kaa sthaan jaise sawaal shaamil hai
 To a large extent the principles of existentialism emphasize that conscious reality is very complex and lacks any "objective" or universally known value: by accepting and leaving it to the individual, not just about it By talking or imagining it in mind, value should be created
 Here this drama can be seen touching all these issues
 godot sahit baket kii zyaadaatar rachanaaon ko darshanik or saahitiyik vidwaan theatre of da absard ke andolan kaa hissaa maanate hai jo theatre kaa ek aisa rup he jisaki utpatti albert kaamu ke nirarthakwaadi darshan se hui thi
 Futileism itself is a branch of traditional assertions of existentialism, whose precursor was Søren Kierkegaard, and who believes that mankind is incapable of detecting it because of some form of mental or philosophical limitation, despite the existence of meaning well contained in the universe
 is
 is prakaar maanavtaa da absard yaa aatanrik uddeshy ke abhaav main astitv kii param nirarthakta kaa saamana karne ke liye abhishpt he
 Right after DD and Gogo are particularly selfish and rude the boy comes to tell that Godot is not coming
 ladke ko namrata or aashaa kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue dekha ja saktaa he jiske baad ek ubharate vyaktitv or charitra dwaara jaanboojhkar dayaa ke bhav kaa tyaag kar diya jaataa he or is maamle main yuva pojo or lucky shaamil ho sakate hai
 Godot thus has a sense of pity and fails to reach his promise every day
 kisi ko is baat kii parvaah nahin he ki ek ladke ko peeta gaya he
 The irony in this interpretation is that only by making their hearts compassionate can the characters waiting near the tree move forward and stop waiting for Godot
 baket kii luk 23:39–43 kii do choron kii kahani ke samavesh main bahut kuch padhane ko mil saktaa he or uske baad pachhataave par charchaa kii ja sakati he
 It is easy to see the solitude tree as a representative of the Christian cross or indeed as a tree of life
