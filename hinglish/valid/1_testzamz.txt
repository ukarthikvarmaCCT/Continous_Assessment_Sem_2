 The reality is that leadership does not refer to one of these behaviors, but leadership is the way in which a person influences others more than his own behavior rather than the behavior of others
 bhale hi yah kaary dabaav dwaara kiya gaya he athwa vyaktigat sambandhi gunon ko pradarshit karke kiya gaya ho
 Pinzer has defined leadership in this way - "leadership is a notion that makes the relationship between the individual and the environment clear, it describes the situation in which a person has taken place in a particular environment in such a way that his Desire, emotion and insight direct and control other people to achieve a common goal 
 ’’ is paribhaasha ke aadhaar sameekaran ke rup main is prakaar rakhaa ja saktaa he- vishisht paryaavaran, vyakti kii sthiti, nirdesh, netritv arthath vyakti ek vishesh paryaavaran main ek vishesh sthiti ko praapt kar letaa he jo vah apni kshamtaaon athwa gunon ke dwaara duusare vyaktiyon ko prabhavit karne lagata he
 This is the leadership position
 lepior or farnsworth ke anusaar- ‘‘netritv vah vyavhaar he jo dusron ke vyavhaar ko usase adhik prabhavit karata he jitna ki duusare vyaktiyon ke vyavhaar netaa ko prabhavit karte hai
 "according to Seamen and Maurice -" Leadership is in those actions given by individuals that influence other people in a particular direction
 ’’ kinwal yang ke anusaar- ‘‘netritv kii vivechna prabhutv ke rup main kii jaani chahie
 '' netritv kii visheshtaayen is prakaar hai- Leadership is required for each group
 chaahe vah rajnatik ho yaa saamaajik, dharmik ho yaa audyogic
 No group is non-existent without leadership
 audyogic kshetra main maalik yaa karmchaaree hi netaa kaa chayan karte he
 It should be that both the owner and the employee together choose the leader
 is prakaar kii adarsh chayan pranali ke dwaara maalik or karmchaaree ke bich ke chote-chote jhagadon ko roka ja saktaa he
 This can also solve problems quickly
 maalikon tathaa prabandhakon dwaara chunaa vyakti adhik swaami-bhakthi rakhata he or karmchaariyon ke hiton ko upekshit kar saktaa he
 In contrast, the person chosen by the employees is responsible to the employees
 is prakaar niti sangharsh badhane lagata he
 Effective leadership, therefore, requires that both the owner and the employee together choose a qualified, experienced and behavior-efficient person to be the leader
 netritv ko teen str par teen virgo main baanta gaya he- In the first level management, the upper class Big Boss, only the boss in the middle level and the foreman or supervisor in the third category
 ye teenon prakaar ke netaa bhinn-bhinn staron par kaary karte he
 Their responsibilities and duties also vary
 netaa ko apane pad par bane rahane ke liye aavashyak hota he ki vah apane samooh ke prayek paksh par sambandh banaae rakhane main samarth ho
 Therefore, for smooth work, it is necessary that the leader always maintain close relations with the employees of his group, this will not bring tension between the leader and the employees nor will any other problems affect the production
 kaarkaane ke prayek kaary main pradhan kaary karmchaariyon par hi nirbhar rahata he
 Employees are the important unit of work operations
 bhale hi takneekee dhang se prashikshan praapt ho yaa nahin, phir bhi usee ke dwaara utpaadan kaa pratham charan aarambh hota he
 After the employee, the supervisor is then an officer of different types depending on the nature of work
 adhikari ke anek kaary hote he
 The officer oversees the smooth running of the work, the responsibilities of the employee, the quantity of production, its quality etc
 duusari ore vah karmchaariyon ko samay-samay par nirdesh dena, un par niyatrann rakhana, unke aapasi jhagadon kaa nipataara, unki uchit-anuchit maangon ko dhyaan se sunanaa tathaa unka nivaaran karnaa aadi kaary adhikari ke kaary kshetra main aate ho jin par adhikari ko har samay tatpar rahanaa hota he
 If this is not done then the system gets disturbed
 jisase utpaadan, karmchaaree tathaa prambdhak isse prabhavit hote hai
 Supervisors are leaders to supervise the work of employees
 utpaadan ke liye yah aavashyak hota hai ki karmchaaree apane kaary ke saath samaayojan karen
 This adjustment of staff depends on the officers and their system of governance
 udyogon main avyavashtha jaise hadtaal, talabandi, karmchaaree evam prabandhakon ke bich aapasi sambandh aadi aise paksh hai jinka sambandh karmchaaree or prabandhakon kii galat fahmi se hota hai
 But the main reason is intelligent leadership
 netritv hi aisa vikalp he jo kaary-pranali main santulan banaaye rakhata he
 This type of leadership is done by an officer class, hence the officer or manager is called the leader
 udyog main vetan tathaa anya suvidhaayen praapt karne vaale karmchaariyon main kai karmchaaree aise hote jo man lagaakar sampoorn shakti se kaary karte hai
 While there are many employees who interrupt the work
 isi prakaar ke karmchaaree netaa ke liye samasya paidaa karte hai
 Leadership characteristics and pragmatism are the practical characteristics of such employees
 adhikariyon ko karmchaariyon ke sampark main rahanaa chahie, unhen udyog main ek ikai ke rup main maananaa chahie
 This can reduce mutual differences, hatred, malice etc
 karmchaaree bhi adhikariyon kii tarah ek sambhrant vyakti hota he, uski bhi apni maan-pratishtha hoti he
 The officer should not behave in such a way that the employee feels that he is being perceived differently or is being pressurized
 adhikari ko is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki karmchaaree kii bhi apni icchhaaen hoti hai
 They are a great force in the industry
 yah sanghathan hi udyog kii bhalaai or unnati main mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa karata he
 Therefore officers and owners should have good ideas for this organization so that bad feelings do not arise within the organization
 vipareet ja rahe karmchaariyon ko sahi maarg-darshan dena chahie, unke bich main vichaar goshtee kaa aayojan karnaa chahie tathaa unke vichaaron ko sahi disha deni chahie
 The officers should think about the interests of the employees and take into account their appropriate demands
 karmchaariyon kii maang vetan, labhaansh aadi se sambandhit hoti hai
 They also give importance to their medical and residency demands
 ve samajotthana kii baat bhi karte hai lekin udyog main avyavashtha utpann karte hai
 Continuation of sabotage, fasting, strike etc
 goes on
 aisi visham paristhitiyon main hi prabandhakon, maalikon tathaa adhikariyon ko mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaani padati he
 Employees' demands and demands should be taken seriously
 yah yaad rahe ki moolyavriddhi ke saath manhagaai bhatte kii maang bhi uchit he
 In such circumstances, the officers should hold a seminar with the employees and understand each other through mutual discussion and solve the problem by agreement
 hameshaa sahi drushtikon apnaanaa chahie
 The ability and quality of officers is the conductor of this so that they understand each other from close quarters
 udyog main karmchaaree ke kaary kii dekhbhaal hetu suparvaaiger yaa nireekshak hote he, ye nireekshak hi netaa kehalaate hai
 Characteristics and mild behavior of inspectors depends on the kind of factory policies
 in nitiyon kaa nirmaan prabandhakagan dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The policies should be in such a way as to instill a sense of trust in the employees
 in nitiyon ko kaary rup dene vaala nireekshak hota he isliye yah aavashyak he ki kaarkaane main nirikshakon ke chunaav main unki eemaandaaree, sahanubhuti, kaary ke prati lagan tathaa sabhi achche gunon ko mahatv diya jaae
 Only a qualified inspector can strike a balance between employees and work
 vyavahaarakushal or sahansheel nireekshak karmchaariyon par visisth chhap chhodte hai
 They succeed in getting employees to work at will
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki nireekshak adhik budhimaan ho lekin yah aavashyak he ki nireekshak ko vyavahaarakushal hona chahie, nireekshak ko prashikshit hona chahie
 If the inspector is trained, it is easy for employees to establish adjustments
 isliye niyukti pad nireekshak ko prashikshit kiya janaa chahie
 a trained and experienced inspector is not only a skilled leader but can also solve problems in difficult situations
 aisa kushal janatantric netaa karmchaariyon ke saath samjhaute yaa man-mutaav ke samay apni pratishtha ko aage nahin aane detaa
 He controls his emotions and behaves fairly
 sajjan, eemaandaar va mehnatee karmchaariyon ko mahatv detaa he, un karmchaariyon ko utpeedan se bachaata he
 Provides maximum facilities to the employees and craig evam charts ne ek safal netaa ne nimnlikhit gunon kaa hona aavashyak mana he- Blum has described five principles
 unke anusaar safal netaa ko nimna paanch siddhaton antargat kaary karnaa chahie- In this context, Blum instructs a successful leader not to perform tasks that maintain a distance between the employee and the leader
 ve kaary he- The following are the functions of a democratic leader samasyaon kii ore dhyaan dena- netaa ko chahie ki vah karmchaaree kii samasyaon par dhyaan de, isse karmchaaree main niraashaa kii sthiti paidaa nahin hoti
 If their problems are ignored or attempts are made to suppress them then it will have the opposite effect on the employee
 isliye unki samasyaon par uchit vichaar-vimarsh karnaa chahie
 Group meeting - The leader should organize a collective meeting with employees
 jisamen karmchaariyon ke vichaaron ko dhyanpurvak sunanaa chahie tathaa apane suzav dene chahie
 Employees should be motivated to do group work
 samooh main baithkar karmchaariyon kii samasyaon par vichaar-vimarsh kaa aadan-pradaan karnaa chahie
 Giving information about a definite purpose - Employees should be well informed about the purpose of their group
 saath main yah bhi aavashyak he ki uddeshy tak pahunchane vaale sadhano main kise, kis tarah apanaaya jaay aadi kaary jan tantric netaa ko karne chahie
 This makes the employee aware of the appropriate tasks to achieve the goal
 kaaryakshmata ke maapdand nishchit karnaa - janatantric netaa ko chahie ki vah karmchaariyon kii kaaryakshmata ke maapdand nishchit kar de or usase parichit kara de
 Reasonable Decisions - The leader must make appropriate decisions and the employees must also accept those decisions
 karmchaaree varg yadi nirnyon main shankaa vyakt kare to use yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki ve apni shankaa kaa samaadhaan samuhik baithak main kar sakate hai
 Motivating - Employees should realize that their hard work, honesty etc
 have a special effect on production
 isse sanstha kii pragati hoti he
 In which the progress of employees is the same
 is pragati ke liye karmchaariyon ko vishesh paritoshik, aarthik labhaansh, padonnati aadi die jane kii charchaa karnaa, janatantric netaa kaa kaary he
 This gives a kind of relief to the employee, he is excited about the work
 udyog main netaa kii safalataa is baat par nirbhar karti he ki vah apane vyavhaar main kuch moolbhoot niyamon ko bhi shaamil kare
 This creates a balance between employee and leader
 kuch niyam is prakaar hai- Listening to problems patiently - Employees have their own problems which are faced by the leader
 aise main yadi netaa uttejit ho jaataa he to karmchaaree apni baat ko puraa nahin bataa paata he
 This discourages the employee
 isliye karmchaaree ko baat karte samay bich main bhi nahin tokna chahie yaa use rokna nahin chahie
 This creates a feeling of neglect in the mind of the employee
 iske vipareet karmchaaree kii baton ko shantipurvak evam dhairyata se sunanaa chahie
 This keeps the employee's trust in their leader
 ve netaa kii avhelnaa bhi nahin karte hai
 Decision wisely - The leader should not be in a hurry to take any decision
 soch-samajhakar liya hua nirnay baadhak nahin banataa he
 Many problems can be solved appropriately by this
 karmchaariyon ko hatotsahit na karnaa - yadi netaa karmchaariyon ko hatotsahit karegaa to nishchit hi uskaa prabhaav udyog main padegaa
 Employees should be encouraged from time to time so that employees remain aware of their work
 yadi karmchaaree apni samasya lekar aata he to bhi use daant-fatkaar nahin deni chahie
 But their morale should be increased
 netaa kam se kam samvedansheel va samvegshil ho - udyog main praayah netaa ke saamne sam tathaa visham paristhiti aati rahati he
 If the leader assimilates itself under these circumstances, it will not be good for the industry
 netaa kii shikaayat adhiktar samvegpurn hoti he
 In such a situation, if the leader does not control himself, treat the employees in a cautious manner, then the problem can become even more complicated
 iske vipareet yadi karmchaaree par aavashyaktaa se adhik samvednaa karata he to bhi karmchaaree iskaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 Therefore the leader should behave judiciously
 netaa swayan vaad-vivaad se bachaa rahe - praayah dekha jaataa he ki vaad-vivaad vaimnasyta paidaa karata he
 Therefore, the leader should avoid debate with employees
 adhik vaad-vivaad se karmchaaree bhi apane ko asurakshit mahasoos karne lagate hai
 Commandments can be given to employees
 unhen thopane kaa prayaas nahin karnaa chahie, isse karmchaaree ek atirikt boj samajhane lagata he
 Praising employees - The employee plays an important role in the industry
 netaa ko chahie ki vah samay aane par uski prashansa kare
 Praise be in front of everyone
 isse karmchaaree prasannataa kaa anubhav karata he
 It boosts its morale
 vah apane kaary ko mehnat tathaa lagan se karne lagata he
 On the contrary, if the evils of the employee are told in front of everyone, then the situation of the employee will be tense
 uskaa prabhaav udyog par padegaa
 Therefore, the leader keeps the evils of the employee in solitude by keeping the key of the employee safe

 From this, it was tried to know that what will be the mood of the officers who are surrounded by industrial environment and who have direct contact with the employees? This questionnaire is as follows- isi prakaar ke kai prashn banaae gaye
 By analyzing the answers that came out of these questions, the following information was obtained- is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Leadership ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 In the past, some researchers have argued that the actual impact of leaders on organizational outcomes is egoistic and has become obtrusive as a result of the biased characteristics of leaders
 Despite these claims, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers
 unka maananaa he ki netritv mahatvapurn he or anusandhan kii dharna he ki netaa mahatvapurn sanghathanaatmak parinaamon main yogadan kar samarthan karte hai 
 safal pradarshan ko sugam banane ke liye netritv pradarshan ko samajhnaa or maapna jaruri he
 Work performance usually reflects behavior that contributes to organizational success
 campbell ne vishisht prakaar ke pradarshan ayaamon ko pahachaanaa, inamen se netritv aayam ek he
 There is no definitive and holistic definition of leadership performance
 netritvpradarshan kii oot main kai vishisht dharanaen aa jaati hai, jaise - netaa kii prabhaavashiltaa, netaa kii unnati, netaa kaa udbhav 
 udhaaharan ke liye, netritv pradarshan kaa prayog, vyaktigat netaa kii safalataa, samooh yaa sanghathan ke pradarshan yaa netaa ke udbhav ke liye hota he
 The perception of each of these measures is different
 haalanki ye pahalu ek duusare se sambandhit ho sakate hai, unke parinaam alag ho sakate hai or unka samavesh aavedan / anusandhan kendribhoot hone par nirbhar hota hai
 An organization that is set up as a means or formed to achieve defined objectives can be called a formal organization
 iskaa namoona is baat ko nirdishit karata he ki kis tarah ek sanghathan main lakshyon ko vargeekrut or nirdisht karte hai jo sanghathan ke upavibhaagon main parilakshith hota he
 Divisions, Departments, Classes, Status, Employment and Work, Builds Infrastructure
 is prakaar, aupchaarik sanghathan ko graahakon yaa apane sadasyon ke saath avyaktigat rup se pesh aana chahie
webar kii paribhaasha ke anusaar, pravesh or baad kii pragati yogyata yaa varishthata ke dwaara hoti he
 Each employee receives a salary and a degree of tenure that supervises superiors or powerful clients with an arbitrary effect
 padanukram main jaise uski sthiti hogi waisi hi sanghathan ke nimna str ke kaary ko sampann karne main uski anumaanit visheshgyata samasyaon ko sulajhaate samay utpann ho sakati he
 It is a bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads of administrative divisions in the organization and remains attached to its authority
 ek ikai ke niyat prashasnic adhyaksh yaa pramukh ke vipareet ek netaa aupchaarik sanghathan ke adheen sthit anaupchaarik sanghathan se ubhar kar aata hai
 The informal organization expresses the personal purpose and goal of individual membership
 unke uddeshy or lakshya aupchaarik sanghathan ke saath mail kha bhi sakate hai yaa nahin bhi kha sakate hai
 Informal organization represents an evolving social structure that often arises and ends on its own, similar to the groups and organizations that suddenly emerge in human life
 pragaitihaasik kaal main, aadmi apni vyaktigat suraksha, rakrakhaav, suraksha or jivan nirvaah karne main vyast tha
 Now the man spends a large part of his life working for organizations
 usko suraksha, sangrakshan, anurakshan pradaan karne vaale ek samudaay ko pahchaanane kii uski chaah or apanepan kii bhaavana pragaitihaasik kaal se aparivartit hi bani hui he
 This need is met by informal organizations and its, casual or unauthorized, leaders
 anaupchaarik sanghathan ke dhaanche ke bheetar se hi netaa ubharate hai
 Their personal qualities, position demands, or a combination of these two and other aspects attract followers who accept their leadership in one or several overlay structures
 ek pradhan yaa adhyaksh dwaara niyukt hokar ek aakasmik netaa apane adhikaron ke bajaay, prabhaav or shakti ko sambhalata he
 Influence is the ability of an individual to be achieved through the cooperation of others, persuasion and control over rewards
 adhikaar prabhaav kaa ek majboot vidhaan he kyonki yah ek vyakti kii kshamta, uske kaaryon se sazaa ko niyantran karata he
 a leader is a man who influences a group of people towards a specific outcome
 yah adhikaar yaa aupchaarik adhikaar par nirbhar nahin he
 
 Leaders are identified by their ability to care for others, clear communication, and a commitment
 ek vyakti jo ek prabandhkeey sthiti ke liye niyukt kiya jaataa he uske paas adhikaar hota he ki vah ajna de saken or vah apane adhikaar kii sthiti ko lagu karata he
 He must have sufficient personal characteristics matching his rights, because he activates by authority
 paryaapt vyaktigat yogyata ke abhaav main ek prabandhak jo ek apaat netaa dwaara jis bhoomika ko chunauti de saktaa he us sanghathan main uski bhoomika ko uske kalpit sardaar se kam saamana kiya hota he
 However, the right to the post supports formal restrictions
 aisa lagata he ki jo koi bhi vyaktigat pad yaa adhikaar sambhalata he, vah nyaaysangat rup se keval padanukram main aupchaarik sthiti, anuroop praadhikari rup se, praapt karata he
 The definition of leadership is the ability to run at will of other people
 har sanghathan ko har str par netaaon kii jarurat he
 For many years, the relationship of management and leadership has been so close that people are generally considering them as synonymous with each other
 haalanki, yah maamla vichaarneey nahin he ki achche prabandhakon main netritv kaushal or achche netaaon main achche prabandhak gun hote hai
 With this idea in mind, leadership can be seen as: koi bhi dwidhruvi naam kii paramparaagat style jo prabandhan ke liye lagu hoti he vah netritv style ke liye bhi lagu hoti he
 Hersay and Balanchard use this approach: they claim that management leadership meets business conditions
 duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to prabandhan vyapak netritv prakriya kaa hi ek bhinn rup he
 He states that: "leadership occurs when a person tries to influence the behavior of one individual or group at any time or for an untimely, no reason
 prabandhan ek prakaar kaa netritv he jisamen sanghathanaatmak lakshyon kii prapti sarvopari hota he
 "according to Warren Bennis and Dan Goldsmith, a good manager does all the work
 a leader does the right thing
 haalanki, prabandhan or netritv ke bich spasht antar bhi upyogi sabit ho saktaa he
 It allows for interpersonal relationships between leadership and management, an effective manager must have leadership skills and an effective leader must have management skills
 a clear distinction can provide the following definitions: ibrahim zalejnic, ne netritv or prabandhan ke bich matbhedon ko chitrit kiya he
 He has called leaders an inspiring visionary who is concerned about the element while managers are good planners who are concerned about processes
 warren bennis ne prabandhakon or netaaon ke bich nirdeshon kaa vistaar kiya he
 He has given twelve distinctions between the two: paul birch bhi netritv or prabandhan ke bich antar ko spasht karte he
 They state that as a broad generalization, managers are concerned with tasks while leaders have relationships with people
 birch ne netaa kaary "par dhyaan kendrit nahin karte, aisa suzav nahin diya

 Effective leaders create, sustain, sustain competitive advantage through cost leadership, revenue leadership, time leadership, market value leadership

 People are dominant in these resources and poor managers see people as another exchange item
 ek netaa dusron ko raah dikhaane kii bhoomika adaa karte hai taaki ve ek drushti ko kendrit kar ek kaary ko sampann karen
aksar log kaary ko darshan ke adhinsth dekhte hai
 For example, an organization sees profit by completing the overall task, but a good leader sees profit as a byproduct that flows from the point of view of its product, so that their company remains distinct from the competition
 netritv na keval swayan ko prakat karata he parantu puri tarah ek vyavsaayik ghatana ke rup main prakat hota he
 Many people can think of an inspirational leader who has nothing to do with business: a politician, an officer of the armed forces, a scout guide or leader, a teacher, etc
 Similarly, management is not just a pure business event
 phir ham yahan un logon ke kuch udhaaharan dekh sakate hai jo prabandhan ko avyapaarik sanghathanon ke aalaa ko purna karata he
 The non-business organization supports vision without money
 haalanki, kai baar yah ghatit nahin hota he
 Patricia Pitcher has challenged the classification of leaders and managers
 unhone ek kaarak vishleshan takanic kaa prayog 8 varshon se ekatrit aankade par kiya
 She came to the fact that there are three types of leaders: each leader has a different psychological profile: artists are accomplished, craftsmen are, technicians are
 unhone kaha ki kisi bhi vyakti kii ruparekha netritv style ke liye paryaapt nahin he
 If we want to make a leader, then we should create an 'artist leader', if we want to strengthen the position then a 'craftsman leader' should be made, if we have an ugly job that we have to hurry through So a 'technician leader' has to be found
 The teacher has also said that a balanced leader is very difficult to meet, any leader has all these three senses, in his own study period he has no such did not get
 bruce linn 'netritv' or 'prabandhan' ke bich tathyon ko ujagar karte hai
 Specifically, "as a leader seizes the opportunity, a manager minimizes the downside risks
 " unhone kaha ki ek safal kaaryashalee ko udhyam or uske sandarbh main puri tarah se santulan banaaye rakhni he
 Without management, leadership does not move forward, but leadership without management takes a few steps back
 prabandhan ke bina netritv peeche jaataa he, lekin aage nahin badhata
 Instead of individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership
 is sthiti main, ek se adhik vyakti samooh ke liye disha pradaan karte he
 Some organizations have adopted this with the hope that they can hinder creativity, reduce costs and reduce size
 Some see traditional leadership as costing the owner too much when a group is performing

 For example, leadership in a group involves many tasks

 The structure of a team equally gives rights as a partner on all issues, usually it is changing leadership

 ogbonia ke anusaar, "prabhavi netritv kii itani kshamta hoti he ki ve safaltaapurvak ekikrut hokar uplabdh sansadhano kaa adhiktam upyog karte hai or sanghathanaatmak yaa saamaajik lakshyon kii prapti karte hai
 According to Ogbonnia, an effective leader is someone who consistently meets the expectations of a meeting and organization under any circumstances, achieving consistent success at his / her potential

 sun taju In the 19th century, anarchist thought questioned the entire concept of leadership
 is vaataavaran main logon ke netritv ke liye agragami prabandhan kii ek vishesh kaushal kii aavashyaktaa he
 These leaders must operate effectively and work in an unstable environment by establishing relationships between individuals, groups and work

 In some stages their development, social rank according to the Padasopan, appears in different degrees or in different positions of leadership in society
 is prakaar ek yoddha ne raja se zyada saamaanya yaa kuch purushon kaa netritv kiya
 a barronet controlled more land than the earl

 During the 18th and 20th centuries, many political drivers adopted non-traditional routes to make their societies effective

 But existing titles and positions often seemed inappropriate, inadequate in some circumstances

 Whereas the traditional view of leadership is that people want 'to tell them what to do
 vyakti ko yah sawaal karnaa chahie ki ve kyon kaaryon ke adheen hai jo tarksangat or vaanchhneeya he
 When 'leader', 'trust me', 'keep faith', then it lacks the key element - reasoning
 yadi tarkshakti par zyada dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he to logon ko 'netaa' kaa anusaran chupchaap karnaa padataa he
 Another challenge to the concept of leadership is that it builds the 'spirit of following' of parties and organizations

 When his leg was amputated, the patient became unconscious due to pain
 uske saath hi doctor sempson jo us vakt padhai kar rahe the vah bhi behosh ho gaye
 When he regained consciousness, he vowed that he would invent something that does not hurt the patient so much
 jab unhone is ke bare main apane saath padhne vaale mitron se baat kari tab sab ne unka majaak banaaya par unhone himmat nahi haari
 Even after becoming a doctor, he did not forget his pledge, he continued the search of this medicine, so that no patient could suffer pain during the operation
 4 navambar 1847 ko koi prayog karte samay unki nazar apane sahyogi doctor par padi jo unki banaayi ek dawa soongh rahe the or dekhte hi dekhte vah behosh ho gaye
 Sempson looked at him with his own sniff and he had the same condition as that of his associate doctor
 tabhi unki patni vahaan ai or yah dekh kar cheekh uthi or kisi or doctor ne doctor sempson kii nadee dekhi vah thik chal rahi thi usee samay doctor sempson ne aankhe khol di or hosh main aate hi vah chillaaye ki mil gaya, behosh kar ke dubaara hosh main aane kaa nuskhaa mil gaya
 Later many changes were made in this and this medicine proved to be a boon for patients

 Nalin Vilochan Sharma was a professor, Hindi writer and critic of Hindi at Patna University
 ve hindi main 'nakenvaad' aandolan ke teen puraskartaaon main se ek the
 Nalin ji was born Vikram Samvat 1972 Magh Shukla Chaturdashi in Sarauparin brahmin-kul of Bharadwaj gotra, accordingly, on February 18, 1916 AD, at six o'clock in the evening near Baderghat in Patna City
 ve darshan or sanskrit ke prakhyat vidvan mahamahopadhyaay pan
 ramavatar sharma ke jyeshtha putr the
 At the age of just 46 years, on September 12, 1961, he died due to cardiac arrest at one and a half hours
 nalin ji sanskrit, hindi evam angreji ke nishnaat vidvan the
 Along with this, he had gained enough knowledge of French and German
 chitrakala main bhi unki gahari ruchi thi
 Nalinji created a new criterion for Hindi criticism
 apane prakhar aalochanatmak lekhon, saahitiyik tippaniyon or pustak samikshaon ke jariye ve hindi-sansar ko naye dhang se andolit karne main safal hue
 He was equally revered as a critic among all new and old writers
 puraane sahitya ke bare main unki pasand kaa jitna mahatva tha, utana hi naye sahitya ke bare main bhi
 His written criticism books are not very large
 unke jivan-kaal main 'drushtikon' or 'sahitya kaa itihaas darshan' naamak do aalochana pustaken prakashit huin
 Posthumously, his three critique books - 'criterion', 'hindi Novel: Especially Premchand', and 'sahitya: Elements and Criticism' were published in a chaotic manner
 inke atirikt nalin ji vishisht style ke ek uttam kahanikar bhi the
 He has published two collections of stories - 'poison Teeth' and 'seventeen Unorganized pre-short Stories'
 unki kavitaaon ke bhi do sankalan hai -- 'naken ke prapadhy' tathaa 'naken-2' 
 He also edited several books
 nalin ji kii kahaniyon ke sandarbh main nishantaketu ji ne likhaa he ki "nalin vilochan sharma ne 'vish ke daant' tathaa 'satraa asangruhit purv kahaniyaan' in do sangrahon ke madhyam se hindi main vah prayog or chamatkaar kiya jo manto urdu main, catherine mansfield angreji main or balja french main ek saath milakar karte
 Sharma has formulated the stories of sexual deviation, pathology, micro-psychology and disguised philosophy in stories; He is virtually the most
 bhashaa kaa aisa ghanatv or shilp kii aisi taraash ke dharaatal par hindi main thodi hi kahaniyaan prashansit hongi
 " nalin ji par apekshaakrit vistaar se vichaar karte hue apni pustak 'hindi aalochana kaa vikaas' ke praayah tees prishthon main nandakishor naval ji ne unki unheen uktiyon ko chunakar, jinase rupvaad kaa samarthan hote jaan padataa he, unhen puri tarah rupavaadi qaraar diya he or vinamratapurvak unka vaicharik sanhaar kar daalaa he
 In this detailed discussion of Naval Ji, not a single sentence is completely positive towards Nalinji
 yahi aashcharya hota he ki nalin ji jab aise hi uplabdhi-shunya aalochak hai to naval ji ne unhen apni is hindi aalochana kaa 'vikaas' dikhalaane ko 'patibaddh' pustak main vivechaneey mana hi kyon he ! It is essential to know the importance of Nalinji in this perspective, that he was not opposed to the idea or the viewpoint, but considered it to be one of the constituent elements of the composition, not considering it as the decisive element of creation
 iske anek pramaan unki aalochana-kritiyon main uplabdh hai
 Today many Marxist critics are also praising Agnayy for the reason of appearance, and his famous novel 'shekhar: Ek Biography' has often been considered as one of the best Hindi novels, then Nalin in this context Seeing Zee's thoughts becomes even more important
 nalin ji ne style kii drushti se 'shekhar : ek jeevani' ko hindi main adwitiya maanate hue bhi vaicharik drushtikon se hi sarvshereshth kii suchi se khaarij kar diya he
 Regarding the architecture which Nalinji has been considered as the most insistent, he has a clear statement that "the real importance of architecture is only when it is the inevitable result of the imaginative object, but at the same time the specific approach
 Could also be a reason
 " yahi kaaran he ki godaan main premachand ke paripakv drushtikon ke anuroop hi ve godaan ke sthapaty ko bhi paripakv / paripurna maanate hai
 He also believes that even if Premchand did not make an equal combination of two different social classes in Godan, that approach could not be expressed properly
 isiilie ve sthapaty ko bhi kaarak tatva ke rup main vivechit karte hai
 Due to these thoughts, Nalinji not only recognized Godan but also identified the importance of Banabhatta's autobiography as well as the first, but clear announcement, along with the poignant and sloppy Anchal, the pillars of progress
 taatpary yah he ki nalin ji hindi sahitya main bhi fishan kii shakl apanaaye sankramak rog kii tarah failte ja rahe vishay-vastu ke kaaran hi agada yaa pichhadaa, safal yaa asafal ghoshit karne ke sakht khilaaf the or rachana ke sanghatak tattvon ke samuchit samaayojan ko aavashyak maanane ke kaaran sthapaty par atirikt bal dete the
 There is a need to understand their intentions and adopt them for the proper development of literature and not to dismiss them as rhetorical

 sookshmjaiviki un sookshmjivon kaa adhyayan he, jo eckoshikeey yaa sookshmdarsheey koshika-samooh jantu hote hai
 These include fungi and protists such as eukaryotes, and prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea
 vishaanuon ko sthaayee taur par jeev yaa praani nahin kaha gaya he, phir bhi isi ke antargat inkaa bhi adhyayan hota he
 In short, microbiology is the study of living organisms that are not visible with the naked eye
 sookshmjaiviki ati vishaal shabd he, jisamen vishaanu vigyaan, kavak vigyaan, paraseete vigyaan, jeevanu vigyaan, va kai anya shakhaayen aatin hai
 There are quick researches in microbiology and this field is on the path of continuous progress
 abhi tak hamane shaayad puri prithvi ke sookshmjivon main se ek pratishat kaa hi adhyayan kiya he
 Although microorganisms were seen about three hundred years ago, microbiology is at its very early stage in comparison to other branches of biology, such as animal science or plant science
 sookshmjivon ke astitv kaa anumaan unki khoj se kai shatabdiyon purv laga liya gaya tha
 The first theory on these was given by the ancient Roman scholar Marcus Terenceius Varro in a book on his agriculture
 isamen unhone chetavanee di thi ki daldal ke nikat khet nahin banaae jane chahie
 In a book entitled Canon of Medicine, Abu Ali ibn Sina states that body secretions are contaminated by external microorganisms before they become infected
 unhone kshay rog va anya sankramak bimariyon ke sankramak swabhaav kii pariklpana kii thi, va sangrodh kaa prayog sankramak bimariyon kii rokthaam hetu kiya tha
 When the black death and bubonic plague reached al-andalus in the fourteenth century, Ibn Khatima estimated that microorganisms reach the human body and cause infectious diseases
 1546 main jirolamo fracastoro ne yah prastaav diya ki mahamariyaan sthanantaraneey beej jaise astitvon dwaara failati hai
 These items can be infected directly or indirectly even at long distances without contact
 sookshmjivon ke bare main ye sabhi daawey anumaan maatr hi the kyonki ye kisi aankadon yaa vigyaan par aadhaarit nahin the
 By the seventeenth century, micro-organisms were neither proven nor seen
 inako satrahavin shatabdi main hi sahi taur par dekha gaya tathaa varnit kiya gaya
 The basic reason for this was that all the earlier information and research was done in the absence of a basic tool, which was necessary for the existence of microbiology or bacteriology and that was the microscope
 antony won luvenhok pratham sookshmjeevvaigyanik the jinhone pehali baar sookshmjivon ko sookshmdarshi yantra se dekha tha, isi kaaran unhen sookshmjaiviki kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 It was he who invented the microscope instrument
 jeevanu va sookshmjivon ko sarvapratham antony won luvenhok ne 1676 main swanirmit ekal-lens sookshmdarshi se dekha tha
 By doing this, he did an unprecedented work in the field of biology, through which bacteriology and microbiology started
 bacterium shabd kaa prayog kaaphi baad main ehrenberg dwaara hua
 It derives from the Greek word βακτηριον, which means - little stem
 haloki luvenhok ko pratham sookshmjaivijna kaha gaya he, kintu pratham manyata praapt sookshmjaivik robert hook ko mana jaataa he jinhone mold ke falan kaa avlokan kiya tha
 The bacteriology is believed to have been established by Ferdinand Kohn
 ye ek padapavaigyanik the, jinke shaiwal va prakashasanshleshit jeevanu par kiye gaye shodh ne unhen basilas va baggeyatoa sahit kai anya jeevanuon kaa varnan karne ko prerit kiya tha
 Kohn was the first person to define the scheme of classification of bacteria
 lui pashchar va robert coach kohn ke samakaleen the tathaa unako ayurvigyaan sookshmjaiviki kaa sansthaapak mana jaataa he
 Pasteur had become famous for the graded experiments he had done to disprove the theory of the then spontaneous production
 isise sookshmjaiviki kaa dharaatal or thos ho gaya
 Pasteur had found food preservation measures, he had discovered the safety vaccines of many diseases including anthrax, foul cholera and rabies
 coach apane rogon ke jeevanu siddhant ke liye prasiddh the, jiske anusaar koi vishisht rog, kisi vishisht rogajanak sookshmjeev ke kaaran hi hota he
 He was the one who made the Kochs postulates
 coach shuddh culture main se jeevanuon ke pruthakeekaran karne vaale vaigyanikon main se pratham rahe hai
 As a result, many new bacteria can be discovered and described, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which was also the root organism of Tuberculosis
 pashchar evam coach praayah sookshmjaiviki ke janak kahe jate hai parantu unka kaary sahi dhang se sookshmjaivik sansar kii vaastavik vividhta ko nahin darshata he, kyonki unak dhyaan pratyaksh chikitsa sambandhi sandarbhon vaale sookshmjivon par hi kendrit rahaa
 It was only after the works of Martinus William Beijerink and Sergey Vinogradski, who are said to be the founders of general microbiology, that the precise periphery of microbiology was realized
 beijrink ke sookshmjaiviki main do mahaan yogadan hai: vishaanuon kii khoj tathaa upjau sanvardhan takanic kaa vikaas
 His research work on tobacco mosaics virus established the basic principles of virology
 yah unke enrichment culture kaa vikaas tha, jiskaa tatkshanik prabhaav sookshmjaiviki par padaa
 Through this, a series of large microorganisms could be cultivated, which had a wide variety of physiology
 vinogradski ne acarbonic rasinic padaarthon par pratham siddhant prastut kiya tha, jiske saath hi sookshmjivon kii bhuraceinic prakriyaaon main atimahatvapurn bhoomika ujagar hui
 He was the first to isolate nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria
 sookshm jivi anek prakaar ke hote hai jinamein jeevanu pramukh hai
 a bacterium is a unicellular organism
 iskaa aakaar kuch millimetre tak hi hota he
 Their shape can be from round or free-circular to the shape of rods etc
 ye prokariotic, koshika bhittiyukt, ekkoshkeey saral jeev hai jo praayah sarvatra paye jate he
 They are found in the soil on the earth, in acidic hot water streams, in nuclear materials, in water, in the earth's crust, even in organic matter and within the bodies of plants and animals
 saadharantah ek gram mitti main 4 karod jeevanu kosh tathaa 1 millilitre jal main 10 lakh jeevanu paae jate hai
 Approximately 5X1030 bacteria are found all over the Earth
 jo sansar ke biomas kaa ek bahut bada bhaag he
 They play a very important role in the cycle of many elements, such as the stabilization of nitrogen for the atmosphere
 halaaki bahut saare vansh ke jeevanuon kaa shrenee vibhaajan bhi nahin hua he tathaapi lagbhag aadhon kii kisi na kisi jati ko prayogshaala main ugaaya ja chukaa he
 Bacteria are studied under bacteriology which is a branch of microbiology
 maanav sharir main jitani maanav koshikaaye hai, uske lagbhag 10 guna adhik jeevanu kosh he
 Most of these bacteria are found in the skin and the esophagus
 hanikaarak jeevanu suraksha tantra ke rakshak prabhaav ke kaaran sharir ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa pate he
 Some bacteria are also beneficial
 anek prakaar ke paraseete jeevanu kai rog utpann karte hai, jaise - haija, miyadi bukhaar, nimonia, tapedic yaa kshayrog, plig ityadi
 Only about 2 million people die every year from tuberculosis, most of them from the sub-saharan region
 viksit deshon main jeevanuon ke sankraman kaa upachaar karne ke liye tathaa krishi kaaryon main pratijaivik prayogon ke liye inkaa upyog hota he, isliye jeevanuon main in pratijaivik dawaaon ke prati pratirohak shakti viksit hoti ja rahi he
 In the industrial area, fermentation of bacteria produces curd, cheese etc
 items
 inkaa upyog pratijaiviki tathaa or rasayanon ke nirmaan main tathaa jaevpraudyogiki ke kshetra main hota he
 Apart from this, viruses which are micro-organisms
 ve sharir ke baahar to mrit hote hai parantu sharir ke andar jivit ho jate hai
 They can be assembled as crystals
 kavak jo ek prakaar ke paudhe hai, apana bhojan sade gale mrrit carbonic padaarthon se praapt karte hai or jinka sabase bada laabh sansar main apamarjak ke rup main kaary karnaa he, protozoa jo ek eckoshikeey jeev he, jisaki koshikayen ukariotic prakaar kii hoti hai or saadhaaran sookshmdarshi yantra se aasaani se dekhe ja saktaa he, orchia yaa archibacteria jo apane saral rup main bacteria jaise hi hote hai par unki kosiya sanrachana kaafii alag hoti he
 And algae which are simple living, like plants make their own food by the process of photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight and can be in many forms from unicellular to multicellular, but like plants it has roots, leaves etc
 The compositions not found also fall under the category of microorganisms
 sookshmjeev jaise jeevanu tathaa vishaanu atyant sookshm hote hai parantu inaki sanrachana saral hoti hai
 Microscopic instruments have an important role in their study
 electron sookshmdarshi yantra ke avishkaar ke baad to inkaa adhyayan or bhi saral ho gaya he
 The magnification capacity of electron microscopes is thousands of times greater than ordinary or compound microscopes
 isse sookshmjivon ko vaastavik aakaar se lakhon guna bada karke dekha jaataa he
 Their methods have been simplified after the discovery of methods of staining bacteria
 gram sten kii sahaayta se jeevanuon kaa vargeekaran evam adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The colony of bacteria is grown by cultivation in the laboratory
 is prakaar se ugaai gai jeevanu-colony jeevanuon par shodh karne main atyant upyogi siddh hui he
 The field of microbiology for study is often divided into several subfields: microbiological physiology This includes the study of how microbiological cells perform biochemical functions, and microbiological production, microbial metabolism and microbial cell structure
 sookshmjaivik anuvaanshiki ismensookshmjivon main jin tathaa unki koshikeey kriyaaon ke sambandh main, ve kis prakaar vyavasthit va niyamit hote hai, isaki jaankaree praapt kii jaati he
 This category is closely related to the field of molecular biology

 The editor, t Stanhope Sprigg, was helped by Walter Gillings, a British science fiction reader who has been active in fan circles since the early 1930s to find good productions, but the project was put on hold after 15 months
 gillings ne da vards work, wiliam heniman kii sahaayak company se sampark kiya, jo pehle se hi unke master thriller shrinkhalaa ke hisse ke rup main khitaab ko prakashit kar rahe the jaise ki kisse kii rahasy or jaanch or kahaniyon kii anchaani
 Gillings had heard that the work of the world was planning a science fiction magazine; As it turns out this was not the case, but Gillings quickly persuaded him to add science fiction to his list
 unhen bazaar kaa pareekshan karne ke liye 80,000 shabdon kaa ek bhi mudda taiyaar karne ke liye kaha gaya
 World's work republished a good deal of American fiction, and since they were paying for reprint rights, their rates were normal for the new narrative
 gillings ko prati hajaar shabdon ke liye 10 / 6 kaa bajet diya gaya tha: nimna dar ne un lekhakon ko niraash kiya jo behatar-bhugtan vaale america patrikaon ko bech sakate the
 New writers had a chance to develop a British market for their work, although most American writers were unimpressed

 It was good enough to continue selling for World's Work, and from Spring 1938 the magazine appeared on a quarterly schedule, with occasional shortages
 master thriller shrinkhalaa main se kisi bhi anya khitaab kabhi bhi ek alag patrika ban gaya, isliye yah spasht rup se acchhee tarah se bech rahaa tha
 The success of Tales of Wonder led Newnes to believe he was wrong to shut down Gillings, and in 1938 he launched Fantasy as a contestant

 Gillings was called for military service, and for a while, he was able to edit the magazine from his army camp, but the magazine eventually ceased publication with the Spring 1942 issue

 Gillings decided that many British science fiction readers would not be familiar with most developments in American SF, and therefore did not make a point of seeking innovative and original material

 Despite being a visionary and an idealist, he was the best, more realistic and accomplished political leader after Lincoln
 parantu 1913 main koi bhi yah nahin jaanata tha ki wilson mahaan vyakti banegaa
 No one knew that in spite of all efforts by Wilson for the United States not to participate in the First World War, that nation would have to take a decisive part in the war
 koi nahi jaanata tha ki vah atlantic ke us paar jaakar vishwa ko sthaayee shaanti dene kaa prayaas karegaa or uske praytn kuch europea raajnneetigyon kii swaarthparayanata or gharelu tuchh virodhon kii vedi par nasht honge
 No American president would have seen his own ideals and plans being mercilessly overthrown and defeated by his own people
 wilson raajnneeti shaastra kaa praadhyaapak tha
 Therefore, he was a thinker
 usne america prashasan par vishad granth likhe the
 His idea was that the sharing of power between the executive and the administration could not reconcile the governance
 atev uski ichha thi ki america raashtrapati ko england ke pradhanmantri kii bhaanti shaktishaalee hona chaiye
 When he became President, he undoubtedly implemented his ideas and made it a powerful focal point of President's rule
 usamen saahasik nirbhikta, niruttar kar dene vaali nishkapatata thi
 He believed that satvik works will always triumph and that the representatives of truth should not compromise with untruths, indiscretions and hypocrisy
 apane shasankaal ke aarmabhik varshon main hi usne sampoorn janata kaa dhyaan aakarshith kar liya
 He inspired a sense of dedication, sacrifice and morality throughout national life

 vah adarshavaadi tha
 When he was elected President for the second time, he was deeply concerned that in view of the tense world situation, America could not be placed on the foot of neutrality
 wilson shaanti kaa samarthak tha
 He was well aware that the war of war would have a huge impact on the ideology, philosophy and literature of the Americans from the American state in the world war
 wilson ne america prastaavon ko shaanti ke liye prastut kiya jinhen europea shaktiyon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The US declared neutrality
 4 sitambar 1914 ko congress ke naam apane rajanyik sandensh main wilson ne kaha ki-”yah sthiti hamaare dwaara nirmit nahin he lekin yah hamaare saamne he
 It directly affects us as if we are partakers of the circumstances that gave rise to it
 ham iskaa bhugtan karenge yadhyapi hamane jaanboojhkar ise janm nahin diya he
 "america could not remain untouched by the Great War, yet in 1914 no American knew that they would have to engage in war
 jab germany kii you-boton ne aniyantrit yuddh shuru kar diya to germany ke viruddh antim shaktishaalee tatasth desh america bhi yuddh main pravisht ho gaya
 Wilson sent his famous message to the Congress on 2 April 1917, in which he advised his country to enter the war and protect the world democratic powers
 ukt sandesh main usne kaha, ”jin siddhanton ko ham hriday se chaahate hai, unki raksharth ham avashya ladege
 We will protect democracy
 ham un logon ke adhikaron kii raksha karenge jo kisi nyaaypurna satta kaa aadar karte hai or is prakaar anushaasan main rahakar apane shashan main kuch adhikaar chaahate hai
 We will protect the rights and freedoms of all small countries and nations
 ham avashya chahenge ki saare sansar main swatantra logon ko nyaaypurna swatantrata praapt rahe jisase sabhi deshon main shaanti or suraksha bani rahe or is prakaar sara vishwa swatantra rahe
 Today is the fortunate day of America, when our citizens will spend their blood and their power to protect the principles on which America was born, on the basis of which America got happiness and prosperity and that priceless peace
 Which he has been observing in terms of great importance
 “ Peaceful Wilson was constrained
 america ke bhavishya ke liye yah atyant mahatv kii baat thi ki use aisa vyakti raashtrapati ke rup main mila tha jisane is yuddh ke aadhaar ko ‘moksh or sudhaar kii sangya’ main parinat kar diya
 a part of the speech of 17 January 1917 expresses his sensitive thoughts towards the whole of humanity - "peace without victory of any party, principle of self-judgment for each caste, collective, freedom, limitation of arms and weapons, engaging System of collective protection for eradication of treaties and to prevent invasion
 “ 2 april ko wilson ne desh kii sarvocch pratinidhi sanstha congress ke saamne upasthit hokar yuddh kii ghoshnaa karne kii anumati maangi
 "let this great peaceful people go towards war - the most terrible and destructive war

 Civilization itself is swinging in the pan of crisis, but justice is more valuable than peace and we will fight for such things which have been dear to us

 The words emanating from his heart were so poignant that the whole nation jumped on his voice in the war for the victory of civilization over the barbarism of democracy over dictatorship
 samudr paar ke deshon main vah na keval ek adwitiya mahapurush ke rup main prakat hua, na keval ek shaktishaalee raashtra ke netaa ke rup main pahachaanaa jane laga, jo vishwa main shantipriy, sukhad va vyavasthit jivan kii raksha ke liye avatarit hua ho
 In the words of Nevins and Koumager - "power as much as power, power without any hindrance or limitation" was promised by President Wilson and succeeded in imposing nation fanatics
 is vachan kii purti ke liye avilamb karyrat ho gaya
 No government before it had shown more intelligence and efficiency in war
 iske purv americavsiyon ne bhi aisi sphurti, saadhan-sampannataa or avishkaar buddhi kaa prabhaavshaalee pradarshan nahin kiya tha
 "peace without victory" had become the slogan of war
 yuddh-viraam sandhi ke pashchaat wilson jab apane sachiv kii salaah na maanakar disambar, 1918 main paris shaanti sammelan main pahunchaa to uskaa ‘shaanti ke maseehaa’ ke rup main swaagat hua
 At that time in Europe, there was a feeling that Wilson is the only person who has risen above the rage and hatred of various nations and is the protector of humanity
 atah jab yah darshanik raja apane siddhanton kii pustika haath main lekar sainik-shakti se las, sandhi kii sharten nirdhaarit karne aayaa to europe kii janata ne uske sammaan main hriday khol diya
 It received unprecedented reception in all countries
 jab vah paris pahunchaa to francisi use dekhakar anand-vibhor ho uthe
 He was praised by a large crowd on the streets and the newspapers praised him
 vastav main sabhi kii ankhen uski ore lagi thim
 The victors hoped for justice, victories of mercy and common manpower
 wilson is sammelan main shaanti kaa deep banakar aayaa tha
 He did not want the Paris Conference to become a stronghold of vested interests like the Vienna Congress of 1815
 parantu vah andaaj nahin laga paaya tha ki vijeta rashtron main swaarth kii gandh rahati he or yadi vah anya tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhata to vah us jaal yaa dhokhe se batch jaataa jisamen vah swayan apane adarshavaad ke kaaran buree tarah ulajh gaya
 His sacred objectives were consumed in front of the conquering nations
 wilson ne apane vichaaron ko prasiddh 14 sutron ke rup main prastut kiya
 The first of its 14 sources was that peace agreements would be made publicly, there would be no secret agreement
 in siddhanton kii mitrarashtron ke raajnneetigyon ne bhi saraahna kii thi
 Apart from the above principles, what else did they have to solve post-war problems? And the defeated nations also agreed to these principles, but the ultimate strength of ideals and principles could not be done in front of the power-loving nations
 is sammelan main bhi rashtravaadi vichaaron, vyaktigat swaarthon kaa bolbalaa rahaa, jinka vienna congress main praadhanya rahaa tha
 Both Clemensi of France and Lloyd of England succeeded in imposing their dogma on Wilson
 aar0bi0 mobaat ne ‘european diplomasi’ main likhaa he ki ”klemenso praatavkaal yah vaakya duharaaya karata tha- main rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa samarthan karuunga
 "but when Orlando of Italy was asked what is your opinion about the League of Nations, he replied that" We would undoubtedly welcome the establishment of the League of Nations, but the question of Fume should be fixed
 “ wilson sampoorn sammelan main akelaa pad gaya tha
 After the Vienna Congress, there was no such global conference in Europe on such a large scale
 princeton main raajnneeti-darshan kaa yah bhootpurv professor ek pratibhashali vaktaa tathaa adarshavaadi vichaarak tha
 He was a man of strong beliefs with a high degree of political foresight, but not so much diplomatic competence as to prepare other representatives for lenient dealings with defeated nations
 stennard baker ke shabdon main ”jis kisi ne bhi usko kaam karte dekha, uski kabhi himmat nahin hui ki vah wilson ke samaksh athwa uski peeth peeche ninda karne kaa saahas karata
 "wilson believed that mankind could be protected only by the establishment of the League of Nations, so he wanted to make it an indispensable part of all peace
 kintu vah maansik drushti se loyad jorge tathaa klemenso ke samaan kushagra nahin tha or apane purv-nirdhaarit vichaaron par vishesh rup se bharosa rakhata tha, atah vah kootneeti ke kshetra main or raajnneetik saudebaaji ke nausikhia siddh hua
 Other countries took full advantage of his idealism and excessive enthusiasm to establish a League of Nations
 anya desh rashtrasang ke nirmaan kii baat maan len, iske liye wilson sab kuch tyaagane ke liye taiyaar tha, yahaan tak ki rashtrasang ke liye vah apane 14 sutron ke anek siddhanton kii avhelnaa karne ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gaya
 According to Paul Birdsall's statement, he was successful in getting most of his sayings in the name of the League from Britain, France and Japan on all other questions besides the problem of compensation
 chini janata dwaara baas hua shantung kaa pradesh wilson ke aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth ke aadhaar par china ko milanaa chaiye tha, kintu wilson ne rashtrasang kii sthapana ke liye anya mahashaktiyon kaa sahyog praapt karne kii ichha se ise japan ko dene kaa nirnay kiya
 This decision was a rebuff by Wilson himself
 phir bhi, paris-sammelan main yadi parajiton ke saath thodi narmi barti gai to vah wilson ke kaaran hi
 There was no doubt that if Wilson had not been in the conference, Lloyd George and Clemenso would have known what to do
 wilson hi unki aseem aakankshaon par ankush lagaataa rahaa
 If Wilson had not been there, France would have died by erasing Germany's nomination
 wilson ke do uddeshy the
 First just agreement according to which the boundaries of nations are determined on the principle of self-decision so that mutual peace can be established
 dwitiya, rashtrasang kii sthapana
 In the first objective, he did not succeed because the peace that was done was imposing peace and not on the basis of self-judgment or peace of negotiation
 parantu use duusare uddeshy main safalataa praapt hui
 The idea of a League of Nations was not original and many people contributed to clarify this idea in many countries, but the League of Nations that was finally founded was Wilson's creation and the temple of his ideals
 kuch vidwaanon kaa vichaar he ki wilson ne swayan paris main aakar ek baari bhul kii
 If he had stayed in Washington and ordered the American delegates, it would have been more likely that his influence would have been more widespread, but Wilson was most concerned with the League of Nations and his desire was to make the legislation of the world institution his own
 vastav main yah bahut durbhagyapurna rahaa ki jahaan sammelan main uski upasthiti swayan sammelan ke liye hitkar na rahi, vahaan apane desh se dur hokar vah america janata se bhi sampark sthapit na rakh sakaa jiskaa dushprinaam yah hua ki uske dwaara poshit rashtrasang ko uske swayan ke desh ne hi asweekaar kar diya
 The US Senate did not accept Wilson's offer of membership of the League of Nations
 1918 main congress ke chunaavon main wilson virdohi republican dal ko congress ke donon sadanon main bahumat praapt ho gaya or seenet ne rashtrasang ke vidhaan evam varsay kii sandhi ko sweekaar karne ke masavide ko radd kar diya
 It was a sad defeat of a great prophet of humanity
 woodro wilson kaa maananaa tha ki lok prashasan ko raajnneeti se pruthak hona chahie
 He is generally remembered for underlining divisions in administration and politics
