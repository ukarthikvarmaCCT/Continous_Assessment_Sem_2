 Can any of you give your head? On hearing this, all the Sikhs present there were surprised and silence came

 In the early stages, or with self-realization, architecture takes place in the occupations, or occupations necessary for the limited purposes of humans — often to provide some kind of defense for humans

 Architecture is also said to bring to light the social status of the ancient period

 Then architecture is also called the mold of civilization

 In these primitive endeavors and in their improved forms, some things are so important and distinctive in all the countries that they are evident even in the greatest art works of a long time later

 The achievements of each historical architecture can be broadly determined by two fundamental principles, one which is embedded in the concept and the other which signifies supreme uniqueness
 misri vaastu main yah yugottarajive vishaal or baari smarakon dwaara vyakt rahasyamyata he, asyrian, babinloni or irani kala main, yah shastrshakti or vilaasi jivan tha, unani kala main yah nishchayatmak aayojana or sanshodhit drushtibhram tha jiske falswaroop saadagi or parishkrut purnataa ai
 It was the love of grandeur, enjoyment and power among the Romans that resulted in a unique scientific creation

 The outstanding quality of Buddhist and Hindu architecture is its metaphysics, which is evident in its development
 musalamaani vaastukala main acolpaneey dhan sampada, thaat or vishaal bhukhand par uskaa prabhutv jhalkata he; jabaki bharat kaa bhimkaay afgani vaastu us shashan kii aakraamak pravriti prakat karata he; kintu mughal smarak utkrisht anupaat mughalon ke or kriti sambandhi prem ko darshane main shreshth hai tathaa bharat kii garmi main unka jivan bhaleebhanti vyakt karte hai
 Thus in the past works we see that the rock, bricks and stones are the only ideas which express the above and reliably, in some way or the other, the religious or other awakening of civilizations that have reached the pinnacle of glory
 in tamaam saalon main vaastukala samayik chetana paryaavaran tathaa sthaneey prishthbhumi ke saamanjasy main viksit hui
 Even today, we keep looking for the most suitable forms for talented people
 aaj kuch aise vaastu hai jo bhoot kaa anusaran karne main hi santusht hai kuch anya hai jo videshi dhang kaa anukaran karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 There are very few who are trying to develop Vastu according to their time, pace and national vision
 is chote se varg kaa prayaas nayaa sanghaat prastut karne kaa he, jo manushya kaa nae vichaar sochane or dhaaran karne kii prerana detaa he
 In this way we try to build buildings of our era and later these buildings will build caste by encouraging healthy development of body and brain
 iske atirikt ham dekhte hai ki vaastukala kabhi kabhi gyaat upyogita sambandhi aavashyaktaaon or uski nirmaan paddatiyon se aage bhi bad jaati he
 In architecture itself, a pure creation of imagination, when expressed with a wide barrage of all perspectives, is able to reach the pinnacle of perfection, such as Athena with the head of juice in Greece, or the simile of Swayambhu in India
 isamen andeh nahin ki vaastukala kaa aadhaar imaaraten hai, kintu yah imaaraten khadi karne ke atirikt kuch or bhi hai jaise kavita gadhy rachana ke rachana ke atirikt kuch or bhi he
 Poetry is impressive when sung in a sweet tone, but when it is accompanied by appropriate music and rhythmic dance efforts, it not only attracts the human heart and the different senses, but also the whole atmosphere created by their glorious combination
 She makes him aware
 isi prakaar vaastukalpanaayen, darshanik gatividhiyon se, kavyamay abhivyaktiyon se or sammilit layaatmak, sangitatmak tathaa varnatmak arthon se paripurna hoti hai or aisi utkrisht vaastukritiyaan maanav ke antarmanas ko chooti hui sabhi prakaar se uski prashansa kaa paatr hoti hai or phir vishwavyaapee khyaati arjeet karti hai
 This commendation of unanimous great objects is everlasting and inspires future generations
 yah satya he ki vaastukala ke prayogon main bahut asthirataa rahi he, jisase aganit sheliyaan prakat ho gai hai
 But what purpose does any of those styles have? Or what is their relation to his era? The truth is that architecture is neither a creed nor a style, but it is an inexhaustible sequence of development
 isliye vaastu ko shaileyon se vishesh prayojan nahin, jaise badalte hue fishan se kisi mahila kii poshaak kaa koi sambandh nahin
 In this subject, Frank Lloyd Wright has said that the periphery of architecture keeps on moving here and there, its center does not change
 aadhunik vaastukala kaa or vyapak arthon main, vaastukala kaa vikaas vinyas kii sanrachanaatmak aavashyaktaaon or uplabdh saamagree kii saundaryasambhaavnaaon dwaara prastut pratibandhon kii upasthiti main sundarataa ke liye khoj or sangharsh ke falswaroop hua he
 When a creation of a creation results in them, then it seems that today's architecture is a sculpture expressed in the form of heavy compositions and frequencies
 yadi is sandarbh main dekhe to vaastukala vyakti ke apane sarjak man kii sampurna evam suviksit rachana honi chahie, jo swayambhu ke ucch str tak pahunchati he
 In the Natyashastra compiled by Bharatamuni from 200 BCE to 200 CE, musical instruments are divided into four main categories: bhalaa / tabl / chameli - goblet drum La]] 2533 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 2533 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of Jesus' birth
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2533 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 sainya bhugol maanav bhugol kii ek pramukh shakha he
 In this branch, international border disputes, areas of strategic importance, geographical factors of wars and treaties, colonies of different nations, UN activities and international peace and goodwill are studied in geographical perspective

 yah nadi rus ke sudur purvi kshetron or purvottaree china ke darmiyaan antarrashtriya seemaa bhi he
 The Amur River played an important role in land conflicts between Russia and China that began in the 17th century and lasted until the 20th century
 amur nadi pashchimi manchuriya kii pahadiyon main shilka nadi or argun nadi ke milaap se 303 meter kii oonchai par janm leti he

 Here also comes the river Zeya, which increases its water and breadth considerably
 thodaa aage chalakar is se bureya nadi bhi mil jati he or phir 250 kilometre baad is se songaua nadi milti he
 It now moves northeast and moves towards the city of Khabarovsk in Russia
 yahan is se ussuri nadi milti he, jiske baad yah china-rus kii seemaa nahin rahati or puri tarah rus main hi aa jaati he
 At this place, there is so much water in it that instead of one torrent, many rails run along it in a wide valley
 lagbhag 200 kimi baad yah ghati thodi tang ho jaati he or phir nadi uttar kii ore chalakar amgun nadi se vilay karti he
 It then abruptly turns east and joins the Pacific Ocean at the Tatari Strait connecting the Okhotsk Sea and the Japan Sea about 20 kilometers later
 lakshmi naam ke kai arth hai:- Kakolat is a waterfall situated near a very beautiful hill, with historical and mythological references
 yah jharnaa bihar rajya ke navada jile se 33 kilometre kii duuri par sthit govindpur police stesan ke nikat sthit he

 There is forest around this waterfall
 yahaan kaa drishy adbhut aakarshan utpann karata he
 This scene provides coolness to the eyes
 is jharne ke sambandh main ek puranic aakhyaan kaaphi prachlit he
 According to this conclusion, a king was cursed by a sage in Treta Yuga
 shaap ke kaaran raja ajgar ban gaya or vah yahaan rahane laga
 It is said that Pandavas came here while spending their exile in Dwapara Yuga
 unke aashirwad se is shaapyukt raja ko yatnaa bhari jindagi se mukt mili
 After being released from the curse, the king predicted that whoever took a bath in this waterfall would never be born in a snake's vagina
 isi kaaran badi sankhya main dur-dur se log is jharne main snaan karne ke liye aate hai
 On the occasion of Baisakhi and Chaitra Sakranti, a Vishu Mela is organized
 is avasar par anekon gaanv tathaa anya log bhi yahan aate he
 This fair is also considered the formal beginning of the arrival of Kakolat, as it is celebrated at the beginning of summer

 fatehper se 18 kilometre kii yatra main 15 kilometre tak saarvajanik vaahan mil jate he,,aakhir ke teen kilometre jo thali mode se shuru hota he,, Hiralal Yadav is a firm pledge worker
 pakistan kii jelon main kaid bhartiya yudhbandiyon or unke parijanon kii pidaa heeralaal yadav ko itani gahari chhap chhod gai ki ve logon main alakh jagaane ke liye antaheen yatra par nikal pade
 They not only create awareness by meeting people, but the pain of the prisoners of war is also reflected in their poems
 heeralaal yadav uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur jile ke gola kasbaa sthit sidhaari gaanv ke nivasee hai
 Hiralal Yadav has traveled around 56 thousand kilometers for the last ten years traveling abroad without a bicycle
 unhone 19 disambar 2005 se 4 july 2006 tak bina ruke do sau din bina gaddi vaali cycle se yatra kii
 In an obsessive journey of 15,000 kilometers, Hiralal appealed to the people whether the Indians would take the news of the prisoners of war only when they were dead
 unhone vibhinn sthanon par pradarshnee lagaakar kaidiyon ke parivaar janon ko unki mukti kaa vishwaas dilaayaa he
 In this way, by abandoning home life, he has strengthened this movement
 unke is mishan rihaai ne bharat paak ke sambandhon ko madhur kiye jane vaale prayaason par sawaal khadaa kar diya he
 His journey on these questions is still going on
 jeevajagat ke samuchit adhyayan ke liye aavashyak he ki vibhinn gundharm evam visheshtaon vaale jeev alag-alag shreniyon main rakhe jaaain
 In this way, the classification of animals and plants is used in classics or taxonomy in English, two terms for taxonomy - taxonomy and systematics
 karl liniyas ne 1735 i
 main sistemaa naturai naamak pustak systematics shabd ke aadhaar par likhi thi
 In the modern era both these terms are used for plant and animal classification
 vargiki kaa kaary aakaariki, akritivigyaan kriyavigyaan, paristhitiki or anuvanshiki par aadhaarit he
 Like other scientific disciplines, it is also an analysis of many types of knowledge, beliefs and systems, which are used in the field of classification
 jeevigyaan sambandhi kisi prakaar ke vishleshan kaa pratham sopan he suvyavasthit dhang se uskaa vargeekaran; at: padap, yaa jantu ke adhyayan kaa pehla kadam he uskaa namakaran, vargeekaran or tab varnan
 The basic formulation of taxonomy is based on morphology, morphology, ecology and genetics
 anya vaigyanik anushasano kii tarah yah bhi anek prakaar ke gyaan, mat or pranaaliyon kaa sanshleshan he, jiskaa prayog vargeekaran ke kshetra main hota he
 The first step of any kind of biological analysis is the classification of it in a systematic way; Therefore, the first step in studying a plant, or animal, is its naming, classification and then description
 aajkal padap kii chaar lakh jatiyon se adhik jatiyaan gyaat hai
 These are sixty times greater than the time of Linnaeus
 prati varsh lagbhag 4,750 nai jatiyon kaa varnan hota he
 More than a million names have been given from 1763 to 1942 AD in plant groups called phenerogams and cryptougams, including synonyms and subcastes
 varnit jantuon kii jatiyaan ginati main padap jatiyon se kahin adhik hai
 The names of more than two million castes, including the sub-castes, are known and about 10,000 new castes are described every year
 vargeekaran vigyaan kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitna maanav kaa itihaas
 As soon as it was understood, man started recognizing and naming the animals and plants around him
 greece ke anek pracheen vidwaan, visheshat: hipocreties ne or democritus, ne apane adhyayan main jantuon ko sthaan diya he
 Apparently Aristotle has compiled the wisdom of his time appropriately
 aristotle ke ullekh main vargeekaran kaa prarambh dikhaai padataa he
 They are of the opinion that animals can be separated on the basis of their way of living, nature and physical size
 inhone pakshi, machhlee, hwel, keet aadi jantusamoohon kaa ullekh kiya he or chote samoohon ke liye colioptera or dyptera aadi shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya he
 The botanists of this time were ahead of Aristotle's ideology
 unhone sthaneey paudhon kaa safal vargeekaran kar rakhaa tha
 Brunfels and Bauhin were scientists on the successful path of plant taxonomy, but the experts of this time classifying animals were still working under Aristotle's ideology
 janvigyaan visheshgyon main jon re pratham vyakti the, jinhone jati or vansh main antar spasht kiya or pracheen vaigyanikon main ye pratham the, jinhone ucchtar prakritik vargeekaran kiya
 They had an impact on the great naturalist Carl Linnaeus, who lived in Sweden
 linius ne is disha main adwitiya kaary kiya
 Therefore, they are considered to be the father of classification science
 atharahavin shatabdi main vikaswad ke vichaaron kaa prabhaav vargeekaran vigyaan par padaa
 This influence reached its peak in the mid-nineteenth century
 isi samay doorvarti sthanon ke jantuon main vargeekaran visheshgyon kii gambhir ruchi ho gai thi
 They wanted to know about animals from distant countries and related them to familiar animals
 isliye is samay lambii jalayatraayen hui
 Animals from far away were studied and their offspring and family etc
 were studied
 ek aisi yatra bigle naamak jahaaj par hui thi jisamen charles darwin naamak prakrutivaadee bhi sammilit tha
 During this period, great progress was made in taxonomy and many new castes, lineages and clans were added to the classification
 beesvin shatabdi main kiya gaya vargeekaran vigyaan kii visheshta he
 According to Haxley, modern taxonomy is a synthesis of geography, ecology, extracellular and genetics etc
 pehle samay main vargeekaran vigyaan kaa aadhaar tha "prakaar", jisko akritik lakshanon kii sahaayta se upasthit karte the
 In modern taxonomy, the description of castes is not solely based on natural traits, but is biological, due to which attention is also given to geographical, ecological, genetic and some other characteristics
 praroop sankalpana shreniyon kii sthirataa ko vistrut rup detii he, ek duusare ke bich antar ko badhaati he or parivartanshiltaa ko kam karti he
 In contrast to this is the population concept, according to which species is made up of variable population and is not stable
 utkram se vishesh samoohon athwa shreniyon kii paribhaasha karnaa vargeekaran kaa nishchit dhang he
 Linnaeus created five such categories: prayek shrenee main ek athwa ek se adhik neeche str ke samooh sammilit hote hai or ve nimna shrenee banaate hai
 Similarly each successive category belongs to one or more higher category
 ye shreniyan prakritik prabhed kam karke ek vyapak pranali bana detii hai
 With the development of knowledge, the number of these categories increased
 jagat or varg ke bich sangh or gana tathaa vansh ke bich main kutumb naamak shreniyan jodi gai
 According to Linnaeus, the species is an alternative category, which includes geographical or individual variation
 is tarah ab nimna saat shreniyan ho gai hai : For a more accurate interpretation of the classification, these categories are also divided into other categories
 adhiktar mul naam ke pehle adhi athwa up upsargon ko jodakar in shreniyon kaa namakaran kiya gaya he
 For example, precepts and subgroups etc
 unchi shreniyon ke liye kai naam prastaavit kiye gaye, parantu saamaanya prayog main ve nahin aate
 Only the primitive caste is used between the family and the clan
 kuch lekhakon ne, jaise simpasan, ne gana or varg ke bich sahagan naam kaa prayog kiya he
 In this way, the number of commonly used categories is presently as follows: vartmaan samay main 'anterrashtriya namakaran code' dwaara jeevon ke vargeekaran kii saat shreniyan paribhaashit kii gayi hai
 These categories are - Jagat, Sangha, class, Gana, clan, clan and caste
 In recent years, another level called domain has come into vogue which is placed above the 'world'
 kintu ise abhi tak kodon main sweekrut nahin kiya gaya he
 Categories can also be created between the seven main categories, for which prefixes 'adhi-', 'sub-' or 'infra-' should be used
 iske alaava jantuvigyaan tathaa vanaspati vigyaan ke vargeekaran kii shreniyon main maamuli antar bhi he )
 The following are the commonly used categories at this time: parjiviyon main vrahat bhinnata, jeev vaigyanikon ke liye unka varnan karnaa tathaa unhen namavali baddh karnaa ek badi chunauti upasthit karti he
 DNA to separate, identify and identify the various castes that have taken place between different groups on different taxonomy scales
 Experiments have been very important and helpful for ecologists
 vargeekaran kii kul aath shreniyan hai
 Changsha is the capital of Hunan Province in south-central China
 yah shiang nadi par sthit he jo yangtse nadi kii ek shakha he
 In the 2010 census, Changsha had a population of 70,44,118
 yah shahar chin rajvansh ke jamaane se mahatvapurn he or ek mukhya vyapaarik centre hua karata tha
 It became the capital of Hunan Province in 1664 AD during the time of the Ching Dynasty and a main rice market was located here
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japani faujon ke isapar kuch der ke liye qabza kar liya tha or shahar bahut tahas-nahas hua

 Apostasy in Islam refers to the deliberate abandonment of Islam by a Muslim
 iske antargat kisi duusare dharm ko apnaanaa, bhi sammilit he
 The definition of renunciation of Islam and the punishment prescribed for it is highly controversial and Islamic scholars have different views on it

 Charvak philosophy is a materialistic atheist philosophy
 yah maatr pratyaksh pramaan ko maanata he tathaa parloukik sattaaon ko yah siddhant sweekaar nahin karata he
 This philosophy is also called Vedabhya
 vedabaahya darshan chha: hai- charvak, madhyamik, yogachaar, sautrantik, vaibhashik, or arhat
 In all these, there is a rendering of principles unrelated to the Veda
 ajit keshakambali ko charvak ke agradoot ke rup main shrey diya jaataa he, jabaki brihaspati ko aamtaur par charvak yaa lokayat darshan ke sansthaapak ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Most of the primary literature of the Charvaka, Jupiter Sutra, is missing or lost
 isaki shikshaaon ko aitihaasik madhyamik sahitya se sankalit kiya gaya he jaise ki shaastra, sutara, or bhartiya mahakavy kavita main or gautam buddha ke samvaad or jain sahitya se
 Charvak was an atheist and atheist logical of ancient India
 ye naastik mat ke pravartak brihaspati ke shishy maane jate hai
 Nothing is known about when Jupiter and Charvak happened
 brihaspati ko chanakya ne apane arthshaastra granth main arthshaastra kaa ek pradhan acharya mana he
 On hearing the name of Charvak, you will remember 'jeeva jeevat sukham jeevat, loan kritva, ghritam peewat' The name 'charvak' has been changed to abusive abusive language
 maanon is siddhant ko maanane vaale sirf karjkhor, bhogavaadi or patit log the
 The prevailing belief is that the word Charvak originated from 'charu' + 'speech'
 zaahir he ki yah namakaran is siddhant ke un virodhiyon dwaara kiya gaya he ki jinka maananaa tha ki yah log mithi-mithi baton se bhole-bhale logon ko bahakaate the
 The term 'lokayat' is used even in Buddhist Pitas for Charvaka doctrines which means 'the system of philosophy which believes in this folk and does not believe in the concept of heaven, hell or liberation'
 Charvak or Lokayat philosophy is also mentioned in Mahabharata, but no original text is available
 zaahir he ki chunki yah apane samay kii sattadhari takaton ke khilaaf baat karata tha, to iske granthon ko nasht kar diya gaya or prachlit kathaon main charvaakon ko khalnaayakon kii tarah pesh kiya gaya
 Charvak's vote is found in Sarvadarshan Sangraha
 padmapurana main likhaa he ki asuron ko bahakaane ke liye brihaspati ne vedaviruddh mat prakat kiya tha
 In relation to the atheist faith, it is written in Vishnupurana that when the demons became very strong with the power of religion, then the gods called on Vishnu
 vishnu ne apane sharir se mayamoh naamak ek purush utpann kiya jisane narmada tat par digbanr rup main jaakar tap karte hue asuron ko bahakaakar dharmamarg main bhrasht kiya
 What Mayamoh preached to the Asuras is very similar to the verses of the Charvak faith given in the Sarvadarsanasangraha
 jaise, - mayamoh ne kaha he ki yadi yajna main maaraa hua pashu swarg jaataa he to yajmaan apane pita ko kyon nahin maar daalata, ityadi
 In the context of Tripuravinash in Lingpuran, there is also a story of a Digambar Muni, inspired by Shiva, being seduced by asuras in a similar way, which aims at the Jains
 valmiki ramayana ayodhya kandamen maharishi jawali ne ramchandra ko banbaas chhod ayodhya laut jane ke liye jo upadesh diya he vah bhi charvak ke mat se bilkul miltaa he
 All these things prove that atheism is very ancient
 iskaa avirbhaav usee samay main samajhnaa chahie jav vaidic karmkaandon kii adhikta logon ko kuch khatakane lagi thi
 Charvak does not believe in God and the hereafter
 paralok na maanane ke kaaran hi inke darshan ko lokayat bhi kehete hai
 Happiness is the main goal of this life in the Sarvadarshan Sangraha by the opinion of Charvaka
 sansar main dukh bhi he, yah samajhakar jo sukh nahin bhogana chaahate, ve murkh hai
 If a fish has thorns, does it not eat any fish? The foursome will go to the field, fearing that no field should be sown? And so on
 charvak aatma ko pruthak koi padaarth nahin maanate
 According to their opinion, alcohol is produced in alcohol due to the combination of jaggery, tandul etc
 Similarly, consciousness is generated by the combination of these four ghosts like earth, water, light and air
 inke vishleshan yaa vinaash se 'main' arthath chetanta kaa bhi naash ho jaataa he
 There is no return etc
 after the name of this conscious body
 ishwar, paralok aadi vishay anumaan ke aadhaar par hai
 But Charvak does not take the inference into evidence except direct
 unka tark he ki anumaan vyaptigyaan kaa ashrith he
 The name of the knowledge that is passed on to us through the senses is extended to the past and future, which is impossible
 man main yah gyaan pratyaksh hota he, yah koi pramaan nahin kyonki man apane anubhav ke liye indriyon kaa hi ashrith he
 If you say that there is prevalence of knowledge through inference, then the error of error comes, because you want to prove the conjecture only on prevalence
 charvak kaa mat sarvadarshansangrah, sarvadarshanshiromani or brihaspatisutra main dekhnaa chahie
 This opinion is also mentioned in the 17th canto of Naishadh
 charvak keval pratyakshvadita kaa samarthan karata he, vah anumaan aadi pramaanon ko nahin maanata he
 In his opinion, the earth is water fast and air is the only four elements from which everything is made
 uske mat main akaash tatv kii sthiti nahin he, inhi chaaron tatwon ke mail se yah deh bani he, inke vishesh prakaar ke sangyojan maatr se deh main chaitanya utpann ho jaataa he, jisko log aatma kehete he
 When the body is destroyed, Chaitanya also disappears
 is prakaar se jeev in bhuto se utpann hokar inhi bhuto ke ke nasht hote hi samaapt ho jaataa he, aage peeche iskaa koi mahatv nahin he
 Therefore, the body that is seen in the conscious is the form of a soul, there is no evidence to be an additional soul from the body
 charvak ke mat se stri putr or apane kutumbiyon se milane or unke dwaara diye jane vaale sukh hi sukh kehalaate he
 To embrace them is to make effort, to eat and live happily in the world
 is darshan main kaha gaya he, ki:- Meaning that as long as you want to live, you should live happily, if you do not have the means, then you should have fun by borrowing from another, who has seen the body come back after burning of the body in the crematorium? charvak darshan ke anusaar prithvi, jal, tej tathaa vaayu ye chaar hi tatva sristi ke mul kaaran hai
 Just like Buddhist, Charvak also believes that there is no element called Akash
 yah shunya maatr he
 Upon coming from its molecular state to the gross state, the above four elements are seen as external world, sense or body
 akaash kii vastvatmak satta na maanane ke peeche inaki pramaan vyavastha kaaran he
 Just as we experience their smell, smell, form and touch, we also express their relatives through senses
 akaash tatva kaa vaisaa pratyaksh nahin hota
 Therefore, there is no element called Akash in their opinion
 chaar mahabhuton kaa mulkaaran kya he? is prashn kaa uttar charvaakon ke paas nahin he
 This world is just a collection or collision of four mahabhutas found in different forms and in different quantities
 charvaakon ke anusaar chaar mahabhuton se atirikt aatma naamak koi anya padaarth nahin he
 Chaitanya is the quality of the soul
 chunki aatma naamak koi vastu he hi nahin at: chaitanya sharir kaa hi gun yaa dharm siddh hota he
 That is, this body is the soul
 isaki siddhi ke teen prakaar he-tark, anubhav or ayurveda shaastra
 For the attainment of the soul by logic, the Charvak people say that the living remains conscious and the absence of the body does not remain conscious
 is anvay vyatirek se sharir hi chaitanya kaa aadhaar arthath aatma siddh hota he
 Experience 'I am gross', 'I am weak', 'I am fair', 'I am inactive' etc
 We experience on foot
 sthulata durbalata ityadi sharir ke dharm hai or 'main' bhi vahi he
 Therefore, the body is the soul
 ayurveda jis prakaar good, jau, mahua aadi ko mila dene se kaal kram ke anusaar us mishran main madshakt utpann hoti he, athwa dahi pili mitti or gobar ke paraspar mishran se usamen bichchhu paidaa ho jaataa he athwa paan, kattha, supaari or chuunaa main laal rang na rahane par bhi unke mishran se munh main laalimaa utpann ho jaati he usee prakaar chaturbhuton ke vishisht sammishran se chaitanya utpann ho jaataa he
 But what is the reason for mixing of these ghosts in specific amounts? The answer to this question is nothing but Charvak
 ishwar-nyaay aadi shastron main ishwar kii siddhi anumaan yaa aapt vachan se kii jaati he
 Since Charvak considers direct and only direct evidence, the only visible king in his opinion is God, he is the controller of his kingdom and the subjects living in it
 at: use hi ishwar maananaa chaiye
 Theorem means accurate knowledge of the subject, that is, proof is required for prama
 charvak lok keval pratyaksh pramaan maanate hai
 Knowledge arising out of the proximity of subject and senses is called direct knowledge
 hamaari indriyon ke dwaara pratyaksh dikhalaayi padane vaala sansar hi prameya he
 Other than this, other substances are discrete
 aankh, kaan, naak, jihva or twachaa ke dwaara rup shabd gandh ras evam sparsh kaa pratyaksh ham sabko hota he
 There is no need for any other evidence for an object which is not empirical
 buddha, jain naamak avaidic darshan tathaa nyayavaisheshik aadi ardhvaidic darshan anumaan ko bhi pramaan maanate hai
 He says that the power of all theorems cannot be proved by direct evidence
 parantu charvak kaa kathan he ki anumaan se keval sambhaavna paidaa kii ja sakati he
 Cognitive knowledge is direct
 duurastha hare bhare vrikshon ko dekhakar vahaan pakshiyon kaa kolahal sunakar, udhar se aane vaali hawa ke thande jhoke se ham vahaan pani kii sambhaavna maanate hai
 The achievement of water is determined by going there and seeing it directly
 at: sambhaavna utpann karne tathaa lokvyavahaar chalaane ke liye anumaan aavashyak hota he kintu vah pramaan nahin ho saktaa
 The prevalence on the basis of which the presumption is considered the power of proof is nothing but coverage
 dhooma ke saath agni kaa, pushp ke saath gandh kaa hona swabhaav he
 Happiness and sorrow of religion and the working sense of unrighteousness are natural
 jaise kokil ke shabd main madhurata tathaa kauwe ke shabd main karkashta swaabhaavik he usee prakaar sarvatra samajhnaa chaiye
 As far as word proof is concerned, it is a kind of direct proof
 aapt purush ke vachan hamako pratyaksh sunaayi dete hai
 Listening to them makes sense
 yah pratyaksh hi he
 As far as the Vedas are concerned, their sentences describe uninteresting and inauspicious topics, so their credibility is relevant
 saath hi adharm aadi main ashwalingagrahan sadrush lajjaspad evam mansabhakshan sadrush ghrinaaspad kaary karne se tathaa jarbhari turfari aadi arthhin shabdon kaa prayog karne se veda apni apramanikta swayan siddh karte hai
 From the above description it becomes clear that the Charvak people do not accept anything other than this directly visible body and world
 dharm, arth, kaam or moksh naamak purusharthchatushtay ko ve log purush arthath manushya deh ke liye upyogi maanate hai
 In his view, meaning and work are the ultimate effort
 dharm naam kii vastu ko maananaa morrkhtaa he kyonki jab is sansar ke atirikt koi anya swarg aadi he hi nahin to dharm ke fal ko swarg main bhogane kii baat anargal he
 It is not religion to perform the yajna etc
 to enjoy the happiness of heaven conceived by the hypocritical rascals, but it is unrighteous due to animal violence, etc
 It is the misuse of things, and the misuse of things and suffering of the waste body
 He should do the same to bring happiness to the body
 jisamen indriyon kii tripti ho man andith ho vahi kaary karnaa chaiye
 Those who are satisfied with the senses should rejoice and those subjects should be consumed
 sharir indriya man ko anandaplavit karne main jo tatva baadhak hote hai unako dur karnaa, na karnaa, maar dena dharm he
 To endure physical mental distress, to force the mind and body from contentment is wrong
 taatpary yah he ki aastik vaidic evam yahan tak ki ardhvedic darshanon main, puraanon smritiyon main varnit aachaar kaa paalan yadi sharir sukh kaa sadhak he to unka anusaran karnaa chaiye or yadi ve uske baadhak hote hai to unka sarvatha sarvada tyaag kar dena chaiye
 The imagination of salvation of the Charvakas is also strongly influenced by the influence of their element, the epistemology and the knowledge epistemology
 jab tak sharir he tab tak manushya naanaa prakaar ke ksht sahataa he
 This is hell
 is ksht samooh se mukti tab milti he jab deh chaitanyarahit ho jaataa he arthath mar jaataa he
 It is salvation to die because the dead body dies experiencing any suffering
 yah maranaa hi moksh he kyonki mrit sharir ko kisi bhi ksht kaa anubhav nahin hota
 Although in other philosophies, the existence of the soul is acknowledged to be free and the nature of salvation is different in different philosophies, yet the Charvakas do not support their belief
 ve na to moksh ko nity maanate hue sanmaatr maanate hai, na nity maanate hue sat or chit swaroop maanate hai na hi ve sachchidanand swaroop main uski sthiti ko hi moksh sweekaar karte hai
 Charvak philosophy is a philosophy that is naturally beloved by the common man
 jis darshan ke vaakya chaaru arthath ruchikar hon vah charvak darshan he
 The practical and temporal antecedent of all classical serious subjects is the Charvak philosophy
 sahaj rup main jo kuch ham karte hai vah sab kuch charvak darshan kaa aadhaar he
 Charvak Darshan looks at every aspect of life with ease
 jivan ke prati yah sahaj drushti hi charvak darshan he
 The reality is that every human life that lives in the world is a Charvak philosophy
 aise vaakya or siddhanth jo sabko romantic lagen lok main aayat yaa vishrut aavashya honge
 Probably this is the reason why we also know Charvak philosophy as Lokayat philosophy
 yah darshan barhospaty darshan ke naam se bhi vidwaanon main prasiddh he
 From this name, it appears that this philosophy is opposed by Jupiter
 brihaspati bhartiya samaaj main devataaon ke guru ke rup main maanya hai
 But Jupiter is not one in Indian literature
 charvak darshan ke pravartak acharya brihaspati koun hai, yah nirnay kar paanaa atyant kathin kaary he
 The mention of two Brihaspati in Aigaras and Laukya forms is found in the Rigveda
 ashwaghosh ke anusaar anigaras brihaspati rajshastra ke praneta hai
 The origin of the true substance is believed to be from Asat in the opinion of Laukya Jupiter
 isi prakaar asat padaarth kii utpatti sat se maani gayi he
 The roots are called discrete
 chetan padaarthon ko is manyata ke anusaar sat kaha jaataa hai
 The instruction of a Jupiter is also found in the Van Parva of Mahabharata
 yah brihaspati shukr kaa swaroop dhaaran kar indra kaa sarankshan evam daanvon kaa vinaash karne ke uddeshy se anaatmavaad yaa prapanch vigyaan kii sanrachana karata he
 As a result of this great science, considering the auspicious as inauspicious and inauspicious, demons get involved in criticism and blasphemy of Vedas and scriptures
 anya prasang main mahabharat main hi ek or brihaspati kaa varnan miltaa he jo shukracharya ke saath mil kar pravanchanashastra kii rachana karte hai
 If the teachers of various scriptures are to be believed, then the Charvak faith cannot be considered in the category of philosophy because in this philosophy, the work of deception is done only in the guise of sweet words
 yah baat or he ki yadi charvak kii sunen to vah bhi vibhinn shastragyon ko vanchak hi ghoshit karata he
 a description of such a Jupiter is found in the Taittriya Brahmana text that strikes the forehead of Gayatri Devi, Gayatri Devi has been considered as the origin of all the Vedas according to the Padma Purana
 is drushti se yah brihaspati veda kaa virdohi mana ja saktaa he
 Possibly because of opposing the Vedas, it would be reasonable to consider this Jupiter as the leader of the Charvak philosophy
 vishnu puraana main bhi brihaspati kaa prasang praapt hota he
 According to this belief of Jupiter, the Vedic ritual is practiced by the expenditure and effort of polygamy
 vividh sukh ke sadhak ye vaidic upaay kuch arth lolup swaarth kendrit dhurton kaa hi vidhaan he
 a description of the logical Jupiter is also found somewhere
 ye brihaspati veda ke anugami to avashya hai par tarksmmat anushthanon kaa hi samarthan karte hai
 From their point of view, the decision must be based on scripture, but it is absolutely necessary to maintain this classical research logic
 tark virahit chintan dharm ke nirdhaaran main kabhi bhi sarthak nahin ho saktaa he
 Vatsyayana Muni has mentioned Jupiter as the author of Arthashastra in his world famous book Kamasutra
 brihaspati dwaara virachit arthshaastra ke ek sutara ke anusaar shaastra ke rup main maatr lokayat ko hi manyata di gayi he
 As a result, it is very difficult to distinguish between Jupiter, the pioneer of economics and the originator of Lokayata Shastra
 kuch samalochakon ne arthshaastra ke evam lokayat shaastra ke nirmaataa ko abhinn maanane ke saath-saath kamasutron ke praneta bhi brihaspati hi hai, yah mana he
 If the fulfillment of cosmic desires is the aim of Charvak philosophy, then the founder of Kamasastra, Muni Vatsyayan, is Jupiter, it is only appropriate to believe
 kautilya ne arthshaastra main lokayat darshan kaa sahaj pratipaadan kiya he
 In this way, Kautilya, the creator of Arthashastra and Jupiter, the proponent of Lokayat philosophy, is the same
 koshkaar hemachandra ke anusaar arthshaastra, kamasutra, nyayasutra-bhashya, panchatantra evam chanakya niti ke rachayita ek hi he
 After such deliberation, the names of the Jupiter which are discussed in various contexts in Vedic Vamāya are clearly explained in this way
 padam puraana ke sandarbh main angira brahma ke maanas putr hai
 Angiras Brihaspati is the son of Angira and grandson of Brahma
 falat: inaki devon main gananaa hoti he
 In this way, there can be no distinction between Dev Guru Jupiter and Angiras Jupiter
 devon kii sangraksha ke liye devataaon ke guru dwaara asuron ko pradutt upadesh vibhinn lokon main aayat ho gaya yah kathan dev guru brihaspati ke sandarbh main vishwasaneey nahin ho saktaa
 Why would Asuras respect the teachings of Devguru under his guru Shukracharya? Therefore, no one is expected to be the originator of Charvaka philosophy other than Devguru
 kuch samalochakon ne spasht rup se sweekaar kiya he ki charvak ke guru brihaspati, swarg ke swami indra ke acharya vishwavikhyath brihaspati nahin hai
 This Brihaspati is the guru of a royal family
 aitihaasik drushti se denkhe to vasishtha, vishwamitra, dronacharya aadi kaa kisi rajkul kaa guru hona is manyata ko aadhaar bhi de rahaa he
 Just as Shankara philosophy is accepted as Shiromani in theistic philosophies, similarly the Charvak philosophy is undisputed as Shiromani as the most outstanding atheist among the atheist philosophies
 naastik shiromani charvak isliye bhi mana jaataa he ki vah vishwa main vishwaas ke aadhaar par kisi na kisi rup main maanya ishwar kii alokik sarvamaanya satta ko sire se nakaar detaa he
 According to them, there is no object named God in the world
 naastik shiromani charvak jo kuch bahari indriyon se dikhaai detaa he anubhoot hota he, usee kii satta ko sweekaar karata he
 This is the reason that no other proof is considered in the theory of Charvak except for the direct evidence
 jis ishwar kii kalpana anya darshanon main kii gai he uski satta pratyaksh pramaan se sambhav nahin he
 According to their opinion, it is unnecessary and laughable to assume the role of God in the seedling that emerges from the seed
 ankur kii utpatti to mitti evam jal ke sanyog se nitant swaabhaavik evam sahaj prakriya se sarvanubhav siddh he
 Approval of an unseen actor to complete this natural work is meaningless
 ishwar ko na maanane par jeev saamaanya ke shubh evam ashubh karmon ke fal kii vyavastha kaise sambhav hogi? is prashn kaa samaadhaan karte hue charvak poochta he ki kis karm fal kii vyavastha apekshit? sansar main do prakaar ke karm dekhe jate hai
 One is cosmic and the other is supernatural action
 kya aap loukik karmon ke fal kii vyavastha ke sambandh main chintit hai? yadi haan, to yah chintaa anaavashyak he
 Legislative deeds result in legislation, which is the only accepted king or administrator in the world
 yah sarvanubhav siddh tathy, pratyaksh hi he
 We see that the charitable deeds, etc
, prohibit those who perform the prohibited work, by sending them the proper fruits of their misdeeds, as Lok Siddha Raja, in the prison etc
 as punishment
 isi prakaar kisi kii praan raksha aadi shubh karm karne vaale purush ko raja hi puraskaar rup main sufal arthath dhan dhaany evam sammaan se vibhooshit kar detaa he
 If you are truthful about the arrangement of the fruits of supernatural actions, then you should not worry too
 kyonki parloukik fal kii drushti se vihit ye sabhi yajna, puja, paath tapasya aadi vaidic karm jan saamaanya ko thagne kii drushti se tathaa apni aajeevika evam udar ke bharan poshan ke liye kuch dhurton dwaara kalpit hue hai
 In fact, Agnihotra, the three Vedas, the wearing of Tridand and the devouring of Bhasma from place to place in the body are the only sign of wisdom and effortlessness
 in vaidic karmon kaa fal aaj tak kisi ko bhi drushti gochar nahin hua he
 If Vedic deeds had any fruit, it would have been evident to someone till date
 at: aaj tak kisi ko bhi in vaidic yaa varnashram-vyavastha se sambaddh karmon kaa fal-swarg, moksh, devloak gaman aadi pratyaksh anubhuti nahin he at: ye samast vaidic karm nishphal hi hai, yah swat: yukti purvak siddh ho jaataa he
 Here if the believer says that the trade that proves the heavens etc
 is unseen or religion and unrighteousness which leads to the attainment of heaven, then it is not acceptable to Charvak
 alokik adrusht kaa khandan karte hue charvak swarg aadi paralok ke saadhan main adrusht kii bhoomika ko nirast karata he tathaa is prakaar aastik darshan ke mul par hi kutharaghaat kar detaa he
 This is the reason that along with the abrogation of heaven and heaven, which is proven on the basis of the unseen, as well as the regulator or administrator of this unseen, the God also becomes spontaneous in the Charvak faith
 charvak mat main koi jeev sharir se bhinn nahin he
 The body is the soul or soul
 falat: sharir kaa vinaash jab mrityu ke uparant dah sanskaar hone ke baad ho jaataa he tab jeev yaa jeevatma bhi vinasht ho jaataa he
 The solution of four or five mahabhutas in the body is the reason for enlightenment
 yah jeev mrityu ke anantar paralok jaataa he yah manyata bhi, sharir ko hi chetan yaa aatma sweekaar karne se niraadhaar hi siddh hoti he
 Even the ultimate effort of salvation as defined in the scriptures does not accept Charvaka
 chetan sharir kaa naash hi is mat main moksh he
 Due to the absence of religion and unrighteousness, there is no invisible heaven and hell, fruit etc
 in the Charvak theory, it is proved unintended
 charvak mat main sharir ko hi aatma maan lene par baalyavastha main anubhoot kanduk kreedaa aadi kaa vriddhavastha yaa yuvavastha main samaran kaise hota he? yah ek jvalant prashn sahaj hi uth khadaa hota he
 It cannot be said here that the body of childhood, the body of old age and the body of youth are the same
 yadi teenon avasthaaon kaa sharir ek hi hota to in teenon avasthaaon ke shariron main itnaa bada antar nahin hota
 From the difference, it is clearly proved that the components of the body which are meat bodies etc
 increase and decrease
 tathaa in hraas evam vruddhi ke kaaran hi baalyavastha ke sharir kaa naash evam yuvavastha ke sharir kii utpatti hoti he yah bhi siddh hota he
 If you say that this is the same body in the body of puberty, because of this behavior, the above remembrance can be generated by considering the body as one, then this statement also cannot be justified
 kyonki yah vahi sharir he yah pratybhigyaan to swaroop evam akruti kii samanta ke kaaran hota he
 As a result, the bodies of both the states cannot be considered integral
 aisi sthiti main purv darshit balya-kaal ke samaran ko sampann karne ke liye charvak balykaal ke sharir main utpann krida se janya sanskaar duusare yuva-kaal ke sharir main apane jaise hi naye sanskaar paidaa kar dete hai
 In the same way, the rites existing in the body of puberty produce the same rites in the body of old age
 etavata in baalyavastha ke sanskaron ke udbodhan se charvak mat main samaran bina kisi baadha ke ho jaataa he
 After all, in Charvak philosophy, the body is the soul, it proves to be natural
 yadi sharir hi aatma he to charvak se yah poocha ja saktaa he ki 'mam shariram' yah meraa sharir he, aisa loksiddh jo vyavhaar he vah kaise utpann hoga? is vyavhaar se to yah prathit ho rahaa he ki sharir alag he evam sharir kaa swami koi or he, jo sharir se bhinn aatma hi he
 Addressing this question, Charvak says that even though the head of a particular demon has been called Rahu, the common man 'rahu's head' behaves in a very natural way, in the same way that the body itself is a soul
 This popular practice will also be born as 'my body'
 charvaakon main kuch charvak indriyon ko hi aatma maanane par indriya ke nasht hone par samaran kii aapatti kaa niraas nahin ho paata he
 Some charvakas have also considered soul and mind as soul
 sharir hi aatma he yah siddh karne ke liye charvak is veda ke sandarbh ko bhi aastikon ke santosh ke liye prastut karata he
 This Vedic text implies that 'a spirit with science originates from these ghosts and finally merges with these ghosts
 yah bhuton main sharir swaroop aatma kaa vilay hi mrityu he

 He probably died in 1929 in the lower Himalayan region

 From two sides
 ek baar main kai hamale karne kii ummid karte hue, sanghon ne muslim-sambhddha medinan yahudiyon, banu kuraija ko dakshin se shahar par hamalaa karne ke liye raji kiya
 However, Muhammad's diplomacy put an end to the negotiations, and broke the union against him
 suvyavasthit rakshakon, sangheey manobal ke doobane, or kharaab mausam kii sthiti ne gheraabandi ko samaapt kar diya
 The siege was a "battle of victory", in which Muslims strategically conquered their opponents while suffering from very few casualties

 Muslim scholar Ibn Kathir states: "the reason for the Confederates was that a group of leaders of the Banu Nadir, who were expelled by the Messenger of Allah from al-madina to Khyber, including Sallam bin Abu al-hukkayq, Sallam bin Mishkam and Qinanah bin ar-rabi 'went to Mecca where he met the leaders of the Quraysh and incited them to wage war against the Prophet " 627 ke aarambh main, banu nadir makka ke kuraishi se mulaakaat kii

 From Banu Sulayam, Nadir secured 700 people, although this force probably had grown so large that some of its leaders were sympathetic to Islam

 At the same time the mounted attackers from Banu Khuja left to warn Medina of the army
 banu khuja ke purush chaar dinon main mohammad pahunche, unhen ek saptaah main aane vaali sangheey senaaon kii chetavanee di
 Muhammad gathered the Medinians to discuss the best strategy to overcome the enemy
 khule main dushman se mulaakaat, or shahar ke andar unke liye intjaar kar rahaa tha donon suzav die gaye the
 Eventually, the Muslims at large opted to engage in defensive fighting by digging deeper trenches to act as a barrier along the northern front
 salmaan farsi dwaara rakshaatmak khai kii ranneeti pesh kii gai thi
 Every able Muslim in Medina, including Muhammad, contributed to digging a huge ditch in six days
 khai ko keval uttari taraf khod diya gaya tha, kyonki baaki madina chattani pahaado or pedo se ghira hua tha, jo badi senaaon ke prati abhedya the
 The ditch was excavated in chillies together with a famine
 mahilaayein or bachche aantarik shahar main chale gaye the
 The Medinians harvested all their crops early, so federal armies would have to rely on their own food reserves
 mohammad ne saalaa ke pahari ilaake main apane sainya mukhyalay kii sthapana kii or sena vahaan thi; yadi dushman khai paar kar jaataa he to yah sthiti musalamaanon ko laabh pradaan karegi
 The last army to defend the city from the invasion consisted of 3,000 men, and at the age of 14 encompassed all the inhabitants of Medina, except Banu Quraiza
 madina kii gheraabandi janvari 627 main shuru hui or 27 dinon tak chali
 Since the siege was uncommon in the Arab war, unions were not prepared to deal with the trenches opened by the Muslims
 sanghon ne ek maarg ko majaboor karne kii ummid main ghudsavaaron ke saath hamalaa karne kii koshish kii, lekin medinan itane crossing ko rokane, kathor rup se funs gaye the
 The two armies gathered on either side of the trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and poetry, supported with arrows fired from a comfortable distance
 rodinson ke anusaar, hamalaavaron main se teen or rakshakon main se paanch mrit the
 On the other hand, the crop was collected and the siege had some trouble finding food for their horses, which left no use for them in the attack
 kuraishi ke diggajon ne dedlock ke saath adheeratha main vruddhi kii
 Ikrima ibn Abi Jahan, a group of militants led by 'amr ibn' Abd Wud, attempted to thrust through the trench and managed to influence a crossing, a marsh-occupied area near the hill of Sala
 amrit ne musalamaanon ko ek dwandv ko chunauti di
 In response, Ali ibn Abi Talib accepted the challenge, and was sent to fight by Muhammad
 jaise hi ali amrit ebn abd vud se ladane ke liye gaye the, mohammad ali ke bare main kaha, "vah sabhi vishwaason kaa avatar he jo sabhi avishvaas ke avatar ke saath muthbhed main ja rahaa he
 " donon yoddha dhul main kho gaye kyonki dwandv gahan ho gaya
 Eventually, the soldiers heard screams that indicated a decisive surge, but it was unclear which of the two was successful
 dhul se naaraa, 'allaah akbar' he, ali kii jeet kii pushti kii
 The unions were forced to withdraw in a state of panic and confusion
 ali ne apane siddhanton ke anusaar, amrit ke ghuspaith ko peeche hatane kii ijaajat di; ali ne kabhi bhaagane vaale dushman kaa peechha nahin kiya
 The Confederate army made several other attempts to cross the ditch during the night but failed repeatedly
 yadhyapi sanghavaasi khai kii puri lambaai par apane paidal sena ko tainaat kar sakate the, lekin ve musalamaanon ko kareebi timahi main shaamil karne ke icchhuk nahin the kyonki purv main baad main haath se haath se ladane ke liye behatar mana jaataa tha
 As the Muslim army dug well behind the embankment made of earth, which was taken from the ditch and prepared to bombard the attackers with stones and arrows, any attack killed a large number
 kanfederates ne tab kai baar hamalon kaa prayaas kiya, vishesh rup se banu kuraija ko dakshin se muslimon par hamalaa karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 From the Confederates, Huayy ibn Akhtab, Khybian, leader of the exiled tribe Banu Nadir, returned to Medina seeking his support against the Muslims
 ab tak banu kuraija ne tatasth rahane ke liye apni puri koshish kii thi, or kanfederates main shaamil hone ke bare main bahut sankoch kar rahe the kyonki unhone pehle mohammad ke saath samjhauta kiya tha
 When Akhtab approached him, his leader refused to admit him
 antatt antat pravesh karne or unhen manaane main kaamyaab rahe ki muslim nishchit rup se abhibhoot honge
 The sight of the huge Confederate armies, as far as the eye could see, marched Kuraya Rai to the side of the Confederacy, climbing the land with soldiers and horses
 mohammad ke saath samjhaute ke kuraijah ke anumaanit tyaag ke samachar baahar nikle, or umr ne turant mohammad ko suchit kiya
 Such suspicion was reinforced by the movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza
 mohammad apane aacharan ke bare main chintit ho gaye, or kuraija ne gambhir sambhavit khatre ko mahasoos kiya
 Because of his agreement with the Quraiza, he did not bother to make defensive preparations along the Muslim frontier with the tribe
 kuraija main hathiyaar bhi tha: 1,500 talavaarein, 2,000 lens, kavach ke 300 suut, or 500 dhaal
 Muhammad sent three prominent Muslims to bring details of recent developments
 unhone purushon ko salaah di ki ve apane nishkarshon ko khuleam ghoshit karen, kya unhen banu kuraija ko vafaadaar hone chahie, taaki muslim senaniyon ke manobal ko badhaayaa ja sake
 However, he cautioned against spreading news of a possible breach of agreement on the part of the Qurayza, so as to avoid any terror in the Muslim ranks
 netaaon ne paaya ki samjhaute ko vastav main tyaag diya gaya tha or mohammad ke haathon banu nadir or banu kayanuka ke bhagya kii yaad dilaakar unhen kuraiza ko waapas laane ke liye vyarth sabit karne kii koshish kii gai thi
 The leaders' conclusion Muhammad was indicated in a metaphor: "adal and Qarah"
 kyonki adal or karah ke logon ne musalamaanon ko dhokhaa diya tha or unhen upyukt kshan main maar daalaa tha, isliye maududi kaa maananaa he ki roopak kaa arth he ki kuraija aisa hi karne vaala tha
 Muhammad attempted to hide his knowledge of the activities of Banu Quraija; However, rumors soon spread of a massive attack on the city of Medina from the side of the Quraysh, severely degrading the Medinense
 musalamaanon ne khud ko din main badi kathinaaiyon main paaya
 Food was running low, and the nights were cold
 neend kii kami ne maamalon ko or bhi kharaab kar diya
 So tense was that, for the first time, daily daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community
 keval raat main, jab andhere ke kaaran hamale band ho gaye, to kya ve apni niyamit puja phir se shuru kar sakate the
 According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became critical and fear was everywhere
 quran surah al-ahzab kii sthiti kaa varnan karata he: Soon after hearing rumors about Quraiza, Muhammad sent 100 people to the interior for his protection
 baad main unhone shahar kii raksha ke liye 300 ghudsavaar bheja
 The loud voices, in which the army prayed every night, caused the confusion of a large force
 sankat ne mohammad ko dikhaaya ki unke kai purush apane dhiraj kii seemaa tak pahunch gaye hai
 He sent word to Ghatafan, tried to pay for his deviation and gave him the third part of the Medina date crop when he withdrew
 haalanki ghatfan ne aadha maang kii, phir bhi ve un sharton par mohammad ke saath baatcheet karne par sahamat hue
 He consulted the leaders of Medin, before Muhammad began the order to draw up the agreement
 unhone samjhaute kii sharton ko teji se khaarij kar diya, madina kaa virodh is tarah ke apmaan ke str tak kabhi nahin dub gaya tha
 The conversation was broken
 jabaki ghatfan waapas nahin gaye the, unhone madina ke saath vaarta main pravesh karke swayan samjhauta kiya tha, or kanfedersi ke aantarik vighatan main vruddhi hui thi
 At that point, Muhammad received a visit from an Arab leader, Nuaym ibn Mas'ud, who was honored by the entire Confederacy, but who was unknown to him, secretly converted to Islam
 mohammad ne unhen sanghon ke bich vivaad paidaa karke gheraabandi samaapt karne ke liye kaha
 Nuaym then came up with a skilled stratagem
 vah pehle banu kuraija gaye or unhen baaki kanfedersi ke iraadon ke bare main chetavanee di
 If the siege fails, he said, the Confederate would not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad
 is prakaar kuraija ko sangh ke netaaon ko sahyog ke badale main bandhak ke rup main maangana chahie
 This advice touched on the fears that Quraiza had already experienced
 aglaa nuam kancedaret netaa ke abu sufaan ke paas gaya, unhen chetavanee di ki kuraija mohammad ko dosha pahunchaa tha
 He said that the tribe's purpose is to ask for confederation for hostages, apparently in return for cooperation, but in fact handing over to Muhammad
 is prakaar sanghatan ko ek vyakti ko bandhak ke rup main nahin dena chahie
 Nuaym repeated the same message to other tribes in the Union
 nuem kii chaturaai kaa kar gai
 After consultation, the union leaders sent Ikrima to Quraiza, signaling a united invasion of Medina
 haalanki, kuraija ne bandhakon ko guarantee ke rup main maang kii ki sangheeyta unhen registani nahin karegi
 The Confederacy, considering that the Quraysh could give Muhammad hostage, refused
 partiyon ke bich baar-baar sandesh bheje jate the, lekin prayek apni ziddee sthiti main yojit hota tha
 Abu Sufyan summoned Huayy ibn Akhtab, informing him of the reaction of Quraiza
 huyayi ko waapas le liya gaya, or abu sufaan ne unhen "gaddaar" ke rup main branded kiya
 Fearing for his life, Huayi fled to the strongholds of Quraiza
 najad ke beduins, ghatfan or anya sanghon ko mohammad kii vaarta se pehle hi samjhauta kiya gaya tha
 He participated in the campaign in the hope of plunder rather than any special prejudice against Islam
 unhone aashaa kho di kyonki safalataa kii sambhaavna kam ho gai, gheraabandi jari rakhane main koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 The two Confederate armies were marked by discrimination and mutual mistrust
 sangheey senaaon ke praavdhaan samaapt ho rahe the
 Horses and camels were starving and dying of wounds
 dinon ke liye mausam asaadhaaran rup se thanda or geela tha
 Violent winds sparked camp fires, taking away the source of heat from the Confederate army
 muslim shivi, haalanki, is tarah kii hawaaon se aashray tha
 The enemy's tents were torn down, their fire extinguished, sand and rain fell in their faces, and they were afraid of the porters against them
 ve pehle se hi apane aap main gir gaya tha
 During the night the Confederate forces withdrew, and by morning the ground was cleared of all enemy forces
 sangheey sena ke peeche hatane ke baad, badla lene vaale musalamaanon dwaara banu kuraija pados ghire the
 Banu Kuraiya surrendered unconditionally after a 25-day siege of his neighborhood
 jab banu kuraija janajati ne aatmasamarpan kiya, to muslim sena ne apane garh or unki sampatti jabt kar lee
 At the request of Banu Aus, who was associated with the Qurayza, Mohammed chose one of them, Saad ibn Mu'ad, as an arbitrator to decide on them
 saad, jo yuddh se apane ghaavon ke baad mar jaaenge, ne torah ke anusaar sajaa sunai, jisamen purushon ko maaraa jayega or mahilaayein or bachche das honge
 Deuteronomy 20: 10-14 states: jab aap kisi shahar par hamalaa karne ke liye march karte hai, to apane logon ko shanti kii peshkash karen
 If they accept and open their gates, then all the people in it will be subject to forced labor and work for you
 agar ve shanti banane se inkaar karte hai or ve aapako yuddh main sanlagn karte hai, to us shahar main gheraabandi karen
 When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, place the sword in it
 mahilaon, bacchon, pashuon or shahar main baaki sab kuch ke liye, aap inhen apane liye lut ke rup main le sakate hai
 And you can use loot God your God gives you from your enemies

 According to Ibn Ishaq's biography of Muhammad, a woman who had thrown stones during the siege from a battle and killed one of the Muslim sieges was also beheaded with men
 mohammad kii patniyon main se ek 'aaisha' ko narsanhaar ke dauraan uske saath hanste hue or uske saath chat karne ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, us samay tak uskaa naam bulaayaa gaya tha: 'allah is a witness', they said,' He is me
 ' maine usase kaha 'tum garib aatma, tumhaare saath kya ho rahaa he?' usne kaha: "mujhe maaraa janaa chahie
 "why?" i asked him

 She left and was beheaded

 The spoils of war, including the slave women and the children of the gotra, were divided among the Muslims who took part in the siege and the emigrants from Mecca] in their book Tafsir ibn Kathir about the incident, and in their commentary on this verse in the war
