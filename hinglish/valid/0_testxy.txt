 Ozone is removed when one oxygen atom and one ozone molecule are "recombined" to form two oxygen molecules
 o + O3 → 2O2
 In the 1950s, David Bates and Marcel Nicolet provided evidence that various free radicals in particular hydroxyl and nitric oxide could catalyze this recombination reaction
 or ozon kii samgr maatra main kami laate hai
 These free radicals were thought to be present in the stratosphere and were therefore considered a part of the natural equilibrium; It is believed that in their absence the thickness of the ozone layer would have been two times the current state

 Krutzen demonstrated that nitrous oxide survives so long that it easily reaches the stratosphere, where it converts to NO
 crutajan ne note kiya ki urvarkon ke upyog ke badhane se prakritik prishthbhumi main nitras oxide kaa utsarjan adhik hota he, jo antat samtap mandal main NO kii maatra ko badhaata he

 In 1974, Frank Sherwood Rowland, a professor of chemistry at the University of California at Irvine and his colleague Mario J
 Molina, reported that long-lived organic halogen compounds such as CFC behave in the same way as Crutzen reported in the case of nitrous oxide

 sabase haal hi ke prekshan 2007 se hai jahaan upgrah maapan ne darshaya ki ozon parat kaa chhed thik ho rahaa he or ab yah ek dashak main sabase chota rah gaya he
 Ozone depletion is not regarded as a more serious controversy in the scientific community

 It is often said that since CFC molecules are heavier than nitrogen and oxygen, they do not reach the stratosphere in sufficient quantities
 lekin vayumandaleey gaison ko vajan ke dwaara pruthak nahin kiya ja saktaa he; vaayu ke bal itane prabal hote hai ki ye geson ko puri tarah se mishrit kar dete hai
 cfcs are heavier than air, but, like argon, krypton and other heavy gases with a long lifetime, they are evenly distributed in the turbosphere and reach the upper part of the atmosphere

 alaayudh mahabharat kaal kaa ek rakshas tha jo usee kaal ke ek anya rakshas alambush ke saath chaudaaven din ke yuddh main ghatotkach ke haathon maaraa gaya
 Alayudh was a warrior of the Kaurava side
 alaayudh rakshas jati kaa tha or vah bhimka rishtedaar bhi tha par vah bhim kehidimba se vivaah se naakhush tha
 He was hurt by the death of Hidimba, brother of Bhima Kehathon Hidimba
 vah vakaashur ke maare jane kaa badla lenaa chahta tha
 Vahansali was suffering from emotion and associated Bhima with insult to his caste
 apane kishoravastha se hi vahabhim se ghrinaa paale baitha tha aurkisi naa kisi din bhim sebadla lene kaa swapn dekhtaa
 He hates Bhima's son Ghatotkacha even half-alien, but because of living together, he would not be able to say anything directly to him
 anek baar usne ghatotkachako apane vansh kaa kalank or avishvasi siddh karneka prayaas bhi kiya par ghatotkach ke achche vyavhaar,parakram or hidimba ke prabhaav ke kaaran alaayudhaki ek naa chali
 All the people in that clan generally held reverence for the Pandavas and especially Karbhim, but considered Alayudh and some of his companions Bhima as a symbol of insult to their lineage
 yuddh ke pehle bhim ne ghatotkach ko aapane paksh seyuddh hetu nimantran bheja
 Ghatotkacha reached there to battle with his other friends and friends
 usne alaayudhako bhi saath aane kaa aagrah kiya par alaayudh ke manamen to kuch or hi tha
 If the war continued even on the fourteenth day of the war, Ghatotkachaki's powers increased greatly due to the darkness and he ended the horrific form of the Kauravas
 vahamayavi bhi tha or use roak paanaa karn keliye bhi kathin tha
 Then Alayudh entered the battlefield
 usneduryodhana ko sampark kar kaurav paksh se yuddh karneki anumati maangi
 His only aim was to eliminate Bhima
 duryodhana to khush ho gaya parakarna ne virodh karte hue asasuron ko avishvasi bataaya or apane dam parabhim or arjuna ke ant kii batki
 With the might and holocaust of Ghatotkacha, Trastaduryodhana did not listen to Karnaki and welcomed Kalaalayudha to be confined to Ghatotkacha
 alaayudh ne sampurna bal, chal or aavesh se bhim parakraman kiya
 He was jealous of the revenge and became fierce
 lambe yuddh ke baad bhimdhire-dhire shithil padane laga
 On one hand, the deceitful war of Allayudha and on the other hand his illusion, Bhima started coming on the defensive
 bhagwaan krishna ke chehre parchintaa kii lakeeren ubharne lageen
 Only then did Ghatotkacha stand in the middle
 ghatotkach ne alaayudh ko samajhaate hue waapas janeko kaha
 He told the family members that it was foolish to fight among themselves
 usne bachapan ke saath ke dinon kaa hawala dekar aapasi yuddh taalna chaha
 But Allayudh was full of negativity
 usne jehar ugalate hue apanepurvajon kii bhim ke haathon paraajayki baat kii or bhim ke saath-saath ghatotkach kaa bhi vadh karke apane vansh ke apmaanaka badla lene kii ghoshnaa kii
 Being compelled, Ghatotkacha fought with Alayudh
 usne alaayudhako anek maukey diye or baar-baar use samajhaata rahaa par alaayudhbhishan or bheeshan hota gaya
 He did not think of his goodness more than his weakness
 aakhir bhagwaan krishna neghatotkach ko samajhaayaa - he putr ghatotkach ! abhi tumpar waar kar rahaa alaayudh tumhaara swajan nahin haina hi dayaa kaa paatr he
 In war, those who give the enemy many times the cause of their destruction themselves, so it is only wise to end the enemy at the first opportunity
 ghatotkach ne agle hi pal alaayudh ko gira karuskaa vadh kar diya

 Initially, he had two assistants to help in his business

 By 1980, the total amount of Ambani was valued at 1 billion rupees
 1982 main, reliance industries / reliance udyog anshatah parivartaneey dibenture ke adhikaar mudde ke kilaaf khadaa hua
 Rumor has been raised that the company is trying its best to not even count its stock prices by an inch
 maukey ki samaj rakhte hue, ek bear cartil jo ki kalakatta ke stock brokaron kaa samooh tha ne reliance ke sheyaron ki khudara bikri shuru kar di
 To prevent this, a group of stock brokers, until recently referred to as "friends of Reliance", started buying short-selling shares of Reliance Industries from the Bombay Stock Exchange
 bear cartil is vishwaas par kaary kar rahe the ki bulls lenden ko pura karne ke liye nakadi se kam honge
 And will be ready for agreement under the "badla" trading system that was in force at the Bombay Stock Exchange at that time
 bulls pratishere ko 152 rupaye main kharidne ko us din tak banaaye rakhaa jab tak samjhauta nahin ho gaya
 On the day of the agreement, the beer cartel was retaken / withdrawn, when the Bulls demanded physical delivery of the shares
 lenden ko pura karne ke liye, ati aavashyak nakadi ko stock brokaron ko diya gaya, jinhonen kisi or se nahin balki dhirubhai ambani reliance ke shares khride the
 In case of no compromise, the Bulls demanded an "uncalled for" of Rs 35 per share

 The agreement created a stir in the market and Dhirubhai Ambani became the undisputed emperor of the stock market

 The situation was spiraling out of control
 is sthiti kaa samaadhaan khojane ke liye, bombai stock exange ko teen vyavsaayik dinon tak band kar diya gaya
 The officials of the Bombay Stock Exchange intervened in this matter and brought 'ambdala' down to Rs 2, deciding that the beer cartel would have to provide shares in the coming days
 The beer cartel bought Reliance shares from the market at high prices and also came to know that Dhirubhai Ambani himself provided these shares to the beer cartel and made a good profit / healthy profit from the risk of the beer cartel

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Pythagorean theorem ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 The Pythagorean theorem is a relation theorem between all three sides of a right triangle in Euclide geometry
 is prameya ko aamtaur par ek sameekaran ke rup main nimnlikhit tareeke se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he- Where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides
 pithagoras yunaan ke ganitagya the
 Traditionally, he is credited with the discovery of this theorem, although it is believed that the information of this theorem dates back to him
 bharat ke pracheen granth boudhayan shulbasutra main yah prameya diya hua he
 There is considerable evidence that the Babylonian mathematicians also knew this theory
 ise 'boudhayan-pithagoras prameya' bhi kehete hai
 If we take the length of the hypotenuse c and the length of the other two sides a and b, then the theorem can be expressed as the following equation: yaa, If c is already given and the length of one arm is to be derived, the following equation can be used: yaa This equation provides a simple relation between the three sides of a right-angled triangle
 is prameya kaa samanyikaran 'kojya niyam' kehalaata he jisaki sahaayta se kisi bhi trikon ke teesri bhujaa kii lambaai kii gananaa kii ja sakati he yadi shesh do bhujaaon kii lambaai or unke bich ke kone kii maap di gayi ho
 This is a theorem that has probably the most evidence compared to other theorems
 elisha scot loomis dwaara rachit paaythagorian theram kitaab main, 367 pramaan die gaye hai
 Like most of the proofs of the Boudhayan theorem, it is based on the property of being proportional to the arms of two identical triangles
 mana ABC ek samakon tribhuj he, jisamen kone c samakon he, jaisaa akruti main dikhaaya gaya he
 We draw a perpendicular to the hypotenuse from point c and the length of that length with arm AB is H
 yah nayaa trikon ACH hamaare trikon ABC ke samroop he, kyonki un donon main hi samakon he or a kone unka hissaa he
 This means that the third angle is also the same in both triangles
 isi aadhaar par tribhuj CBH bhi ABC ke samroop he
 From these analogies we get two proportions: jaise And inhen aise bhi likhaa ja saktaa he Summarizing these two equations, anya shabdon main, boudhayan prameya: In Euclid's Elements, Proposition 47 of Book 1, the Boudhayan theorem is proved by an argument along the following lines
 A, B, c ko samakon trikon ke kone maanate hai, jisamen samakon a par hoga
 a se karn ke vipareet ek adholamb chhoden varg main karn par
wo rekha karn par varg ko do aaayaaton main vibhajit karti he, prayek kaa samaan kshetra he kyunki donon main se ek pairon main varg banataa he
 For formal proof, we need four primary lemmata: is pramaan ke peeche sahaj vichaar, jo iskaa paalan karnaa aasaan bana saktaa he, ki upar ke do virgon ko ek hi aakaar ke samanaantar chaturbhuj main badla gaya he, phir modakar or baayen or daahine aayat ko nichle varg main badla gaya he, phir nirantar kshetra main
 The proof is as follows: yah pramaan euclid ke tatwon main prastaav 1
47 ke rup main pesh hota he
 James A
 Garfield is credited with a novel algebraic proof: puraa samalamb bai varg kaa aadha he, to uskaa kshetrafal = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 Each area of triangle 1 and triangle 2 is ab / 2
 trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal c2 / 2 he or yah karn par varg kaa aadha he
 But also the area of triangle 3 = - isliye karn par varg = anya do parshvon ke virgon kaa jod he
 In this proof, one can add 4 copies of square plus triangle on the hypotenuse as squares on the other two sides plus 4 copies of triangle
 This proof has been recorded from China
 upar euclid ke pramaan ke chitra se, ham teen samaan aankadon ko dekh sakate hai, prayek main "ek varg ke upar trikon" he
 Because the larger triangle is made up of two smaller triangles, its area is the sum of these two smaller ones
 samanta se, teen varg ek duusare ke saath usee anupaat main hai jaise vah teen trikon or isi tarah ke bade varg kaa kshetrafal do chote virgon ke kshetrafal kaa jod he
 Evidence from the anagram is given through illustration and animation
 is udhaaharan main, har ek bade varg kaa kshetrafal 2 he
 In both, the area of the same triangle is removed
 shesh kshetron, a2 + b2 or c2, baraabar hai
 QED yah pramaan vastav main bahut aasaan he, lekin yah praarambhik nahin he, is arth main ki yah keval sabase buniyadi siddhant or yucalidian jyamiti ke pramayon par nirbhar nahin he
 In particular, while it is very easy to give the formula for the area of triangles and squares, it is not easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of the areas of its pieces
 vastav main, aavashyak gun sabit karnaa paaythagorian prameya siddh karne kii tulana main kathin he 
vastav main, yah kathinaayee sabhi saadhaaran kshetra shaamil yucalidian pramaan ko prabhavit karata he; udhaaharan ke liye, ek samakon trikon kaa kshetra paane ke liye ek dharna shaamil he ki yah ek hi oonchai or tal ke ek aayat kaa aadha kshetra he
 For this reason, axiomatic introduction to geometry generally uses another proof based on the similarity of triangles
 is paaythagorian prameya kaa teesraa graphic chithran main karn kaa varg parshvon ke varg main feet baithta he
 a related proof may show that the restored parts are identical to the original and, because the sum of the same is the same, that their areas are also the same
 yah dikhaane ke liye kii ek varg hi parinaam he, hame nae parshvon kii lambaai ko c ke baraabar dikhaanaa padegaa
dhyaan den kii is pramaan ke kaam karne ke liye, hame chote varg ko or adhik hisson main kaatane ke tareeke ko sanbhaalane ke liye rasta pradaan karnaa hoga chunki parshv or chote hote jaayenge
 The algebraic variation of this proof is provided by the following argument
 chithran ko dekhte hue jo ek bada varg he jiske konon main samaan samakon trikon he, in chaar trikon main prayek kaa kshetra c ke saath ek kone ke dwaara diya gaya he
 The A-lateral angles and B-lateral angles of these triangles are the supplementary angles, each of the angles of the blue region are right angles, making this area a square whose side length is C
 is varg kaa kshetrafal he C2
is tarah samast kaa kshetra diya jaataa he: However, the length of the sides of the larger square is a + B, we can calculate its area as 2, which extends into A2 + 2AB + B2
 boudhayan prameya main pahunchaa ja saktaa he nimnlikhit chitra ke adhyayan se kii ek parshv main parivartan kaise karn main ek parivartan ke utpaadan kar saktaa he or ek thoda kalan kaa upyog karke
 As a result of the change in side of a, da, trikon kii samanta or antar main badlaav ke liye
isliye On the separation of variables
 parshv b main parivartan ke liye ek doosraa kaarykaal jodne kaa parinaam he
 Consolidated returns jab a = 0 tab c = b, to b2 "nirantar" he
 So jaise dekha ja saktaa he, parivartan or parshvon ke bich vishesh anupaat ke kaaran he yah varg jabaki parshvon main parivartan kii swatantra yogadan kaa parinaam raashi he jo jyamitiya saakshyon se spasht nahin he
 From this given ratio it can be shown that the changes in the sides are inversely proportional to the sides
 is vibhedak sameekaran suzav detaa he kii yah prameya sambandhit parivartan ke kaaran he or iske vyutpatti lagbhag line abhinn abhikalan ke samaan he
 This quantity da and dc are very small changes in a and c respectively
 lekin ham iske badale vaastavik sankhya Δa and Δc kaa upyog karte hai, tab unke anupaat kii seemaa da / dc he jab unka aakaar shunya nikatataa, vyutpanni or c / a bhi nikatataa he, trikon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa anupaat or vibhedak sameekaran kaa parinaam pataa chalata he
 The antonym of this theorem is also true: kisi bhi teen dhanatmak sankhya a, b or c aisi he a2 + b2 = c2, vahaan ek trikon maujuud he jiske parshv hai a, b or c or har aise trikon main parshvon ke bheech ek samakon he jinaki lambaai a or b he
 This antonym is present in the elements of Euclid
 kosine kii vidhi kaa prayog karke yah sabit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa nimnlikhit pramaan ke dwaara: Let ABC be a triangle whose sides are a, b and c, with a2 + b2 = c2
 We have to prove that the angles between a and b sides are right angles
 ham ek or trikon kaa nirmaan karte hai jisamen parshvon ke bich ek samakon he jisaki lambaai a or b he
 From the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse length of this triangle is also c
 chunki donon trikon ke parshvon kii ek hi lambaai he a, b or c, ve anukool hai or isliye unka ek hi kone hona chahie
isliye, jin parshvon kii lambaai a or b he hamaare mul trikon main unke bich kaa kone ek samakon he
 An approximation of the inverse of the Pythagorean theorem is a simple way of determining if a triangle is right-angled, obtuse, or acute, thus
 Where c is chosen as the longest of the three sides: ek paaythagorian tripal main teen sakaaratmak purnank hai a, b or c, jaise kii a2 + b2 = c2
anya shabdon main, ek paaythagorian tripal ek samakon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa varnan karata he jahaan teenon parshv kii purnank lambaai he
 Evidence from large stone monuments in Northern Europe shows that such triplets were known before the discovery of writing

 According to legend, Hippasus, who first proved the square root of the two by reason , was drowned at sea as a result

 The Baudhayan theorem is a special case of the more general theorem related to the length of the sides, the method of cosine: is jatil aantarik utpaada antariksh main do vector v or w diya jaae, to boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit rup le leti he: In particular, || v + w || 2 = || v || 2 + || w || 2 if v and w are rectangles, although the antonym is not necessarily true

 Here two cases have to be considered — spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; In every case, like the Euclidean case, the law of proper cosine results in: ek gola jisaki trigya r he usapar koi bhi samakon trikon ke liye, paaythagorian prameya yah rup letaa he This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines

 For any triangle in this hyperbolic plane, the Pythagorean theorem takes this form jahaan cosh ke atishyoktipurna kosine he
 Using the mclaurin series for this function, it can be shown that the exaggerated form of the Pythagorean theorem is closely related to the Euclidean form, as the hyperbolic triangle becomes very small

 The history of this theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of the Pythagorean triple, knowledge of the relationship between right triangle triangles, knowledge of the relationship between adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem

 Among its famous idioms are "april is the cruellest month"; "I Will Show You Fear in a Handful of Dust"; And the Sanskrit mantra "om Shantiha, Shantiha, Shantiha" aliot ne 1922 main apane pehle prakaashan se pehle sambhavatya kai saalon tak is kavita da west land par kaam kiya hoga
 In a letter written on 9 May 1921 to John Quinn, a New York lawyer and patron of modernism, Eliot wrote that "I have a long poem in mind, and partly written on paper, i Want to complete it

 While living there, Eliot worked on the poem 'westland' and probably depicted an early version of Ezra Pound when, after returning to London, Eliot traveled to Paris in November 1921

 Eliot traveled to Lausanne, Switzerland to seek treatment from Doctor Roger Vittoz, with Ottoline Morel advising him to visit this doctor; Viven had to stay outside the Sanatorium outside Paris at that time
 In Lausanne, Eliot produced a 19-page version of the poem
 ve 1922 kii janvari ke prarambh main main logen se laut aae
 Pound then made editorial comments on it and made several cuts to the manuscript
 Eliot later dedicated the poem to Pound
 aliot ne oktober 1922 main jon queen ko kavita kii pandulipi kaa draft bheja; jo janvari 1923 main neuyark main queen ke paas pahunch gaya
 After Quinn's death, the manuscript's draft was inherited by his sister Julia Anderson

 The drafts of the poem show that the original poem was almost twice as much as the last published version

 Currently famous lines of poetry - 'april is the cruellest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land,

 The first page of typescript contained 54 lines, which we can reread at the end of the second section, a Game of Chase
 is pej ko khud aliot dwaara halke se kaata gaya he
 Although there are similar signs to the adjustments made by Eliot and many commentaries have been made by Viven, the most important editorial changes have been made by Ezra Pound, who suggested several cuts to the poet in his poem
 'da typist home at tii time' khand mul rup se panchapadi padya ke niyamit padyon main tha, jisamen abaab kii chand yojana thi, grey kii elegi main isi skim kaa upyog kiya gaya tha, jiske bare main us samay aliot ke dimag main vichaar chal rahe the
 Pound said of this section of the draft "the verse is not as interesting when the poem warrants it

 In one version, at the beginning of 'the Fire Sermon', there was a lengthy section of a heroic couplet, copied by Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock
 isamen ek mahila freska kaa varnan diya gaya tha
 As Richard Almon describes it "instead of making her toilet like the Pope's Belinda, Fresca is going into it like Joyce's Bloom
 " ye panktiyaan hai: According to Alman "pound warns Eliot that the Clonky Pope improved the couplets and Joyce toilets, so no further rounds make any sense
" pound ne kuch choti kavitaaon ko isamen shaamil karnaa chaha jise aliot paanch khandon ke bich daalana chaahate the
 One of these is from where Eliot started the 'mourning'
 aliot kii patni, vivian ke anurodh par 'a game of ches' khand main se ek pankti ko hataa diya gaya: And we shall play a game of chess / The ivory men make company between us / Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door" yah khand jaahir taur par unke vaivaahik jivan par aadhaarit he or ve in panktiyon kaa khulaasa karti hui prathit hoti hai
 However, The "ivory Men" may mean something else to Eliot: in 1960, thirteen years after Vivian's death, he inserted the line in a copy sold to the Library of London
 disambar 1921 ke ant main kavita ke "janm" ko manaane ke liye aliot ko ek patr main pound ne 48 panktiyon kii ek kavita likhi

 The deal with Dial was almost certain, but with Pound's efforts the deal was finally settled, with Lava Eliot of $ 150 being selected for Dial Magazine's second annual award, as he provided his exclusive services
 2000 dollar kaa puraskaar diya gaya
 At the end of the summer in New York, Bonnie and Liveright signed an agreement with The Dial that the magazine would first print the poem in the United States, with the agreement to purchase 350 copies from Bonnie and Liveright at a discount

 Eliot originally wanted to give the poem the title Hey Do the Police Different Voices
 kavita ke sanskaran main aliot kavita ke pehle do khandon ko switzaraland se laaye-'da bariyal of da ded' or 'a game of chess'- jo is sheershak ke antargat prakat hote hai
 These strange phrases are taken from Charles Dickens's novel Are Mutual Friends, in which the widow Betty Higdon tells her adopted son, "you might not think it but sloppy is a beautiful reader of a news paper
 Do the polis in Different Voices "
 This will help the reader understand that although the poem has many different voices, some critics believe that it has a single central consciousness
 is sheershak ko asweekrut karke aliot ne mahasoos kiya hoga ki vah tiracias ke bare main apane note main apane paatro kii tippaniyon ko behaal kiye hue hai
 In the end, Eliot chose the title 'the West Land'
 In his first note for the poem, he holds the title of Jessie L
 Weston's book From the Ritual to Romance on the Grail Ligand in which the Fisher King is wounded and as a result his land is barren
 raja ko thik karne ke liye or bhoomi ko phir se urvarak banane ke liye grel quester poochta he "aap kii samasya kya he"? The poem is mistakenly given the title "west Land"
 haalanki, ejra pound ko likhe gaye ek patr main aliot ne vinamratapurvak kaha ki sheershak "da" se shuru hona chahie
 The poem is preceded by a Latin and Greek inscription from The Setarikon of The Patronias
 angreji main yah nimnanusaar he: ""I saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a jar, and when the boys said to her, Sibyl, what do you want? she replied i want to die 
" a 'dedication' is given after the inscription, according to Ezra Pound: il miglior fabbro "here Eliot is both quoting line 117 of Canto XXVI of Dante's Purgatorio, the second cantica of The Divine Comedy, where Dante defines the troubadour Arnaut Daniel as "the best smith of the mother tongue" and also Pound's title of chapter 2 of his The Spirit of Romance where he translated the phrase as "the better craftsman
" Written in the version, this version of the poem was introduced to Pound; later versions of it were included
 da west land ke paanch bhaagon ke sheershak hai: The text of the poem is followed by several pages of notes, which explain its metaphors, references and allusions
 inamen se kuch tippaniyan kavita ke vyakhya karne main madad karti hai, lekin kuch vivadaspad hai or adhikansh apaardarshee gadhy hai jin par koi tippaniyan nahin kii gayin hai
 These notes were added following Eliot's publisher's request, as they thought it appropriate to publish The West Land as a separate book
 aliot khud mul rup se da west land ke bare main kuch sawaalon kaa sangrah chaahate the yaa ve ek kavita ko paanch khandon main baantnaa chaahate the
 The style of Eliot's work illustrates the possibilities of dramatic monologue

 Eliot Music also enjoys the hall, and the popular form of entertainment is added to the poem, the songs composed by Gigfeld Follis are the creators of The Shakespearian Rag, Dev Stemper and Jean Buck
 yah sangeet faj ke praturup kaa anusaran karata he, jisamen theme main kai awaajen pravesh karti hai
 Above all, perhaps it is the unconnected nature of poetry, the way it suddenly shifts from one way to another, it moves between multiple voices, uses idioms of foreign languages, it is the most distinguishing feature of the genre of poetry
 
 dilachasp baat yah he ki jab aliot da west land likh rahe the, usee samay robert brij apni pehali nio-miltonic cilibics par kaam kar rahe the, is kavita kaa naam tha 'pier pool', isamen bhi kai alag alag bhashaaon se panktiyaan lee gayi thim
 Sources from which Eliot has taken his citations or whose work he has included are: Homer, Sophoclas, Petronias, Virgil, Ovid, St
 Augustine of Hippo, Dante Aligheri, William Shakespeare, Edmund Spencer, Gerrard de Narwal, Thomas Kidd , Geoffrey Chaucer, Thomas Middleton, John Webster, Joseph Konrad, John Milton, Andrew Marvel, Charles Boudlere, Richard Wegner, Oliver Goldsmith, Hermann Hosea, Aldous Huxley, Pau Verlaine, Walt Whitman and Bram Stoker
 Eliot has also made great use of mythological writings, in which many things have been taken from the Bible, The Book of Common Prayer, Hindu Great Aranyaka Upanishad and Buddha's Fire Sermon

 Every team can have 11 players on the field at any time, but teams have the right to change one or all of their players at any given time in the game
 isliye footbaal ek visheshgy khilaadiyon kaa khel he
 In any team, there are actually many players, which are divided into three types: the attacking player, the defending player and the special player
 kuch khilaadi to tiimon main sirf isliye rakhe jaate hai ki agar unke hi hunar vaale kisi khilaadi ko chot lag jaae to unhen unke sthaan par daalaa ja sake
 In most cases, many players of any team do not get the chance to get into the field
 jis team ke paas gend par qabza ho, use "aakraamak" bulaayaa jaataa he or jis ke paas na ho use "rakshak" bulaayaa jaataa he
 The most important player on the offensive team is called the quarterback
 jab akramak or rakshakon main bhidnt shuru karti he to isi kaa kaam he ki tezi se maidan kaa muina karke faisalaa kare ki akramak team kaa koun-sa khilaadi gend ko rakshak team ke oundzon kii taraf badhaane ke liye sabase acchhee sthiti main maujuud he
 Then the quarterback tosses the ball to him, or himself runs away and tries to push the ball forward
 khel kaa puraa samay ek ghanta hota he, jise chaar 15 minute ki chauthaiyon main baanta jaataa he
 The second quarter is followed by a 12-minute break
 khelte hue kai baar gend ruk jaati he or tab khel kii ghadi bhi roak di jaati he
 a quarter of 15 minutes can actually take more than 45 minutes, and a full one-hour game can actually run more than three hours
 jab khel television par prasaarit hota he to in antaraalon main prasarankarta ishtehaar dikhaate hai
 At the beginning of the match, the coin is tossed and a team is declared an offensive team and they are given the ball
 ab 50 gaz kii lakeer par donon timen ek dusre se bhidane ke liye aamane-saamne lakeeren banaakar khadi ho jaati hai
 The quarterback of the offensive team stands behind his team
 maahaul thik aisa hota he ki do gut jang ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hon
 The game begins when the ball reaches the hands of the offensive quarterback
 foran rakshak team ke khilaadi us tak pahunch kar use dhane kii ziddo-jahad main lag jate hai
 Some aggressive players try to stop them by confronting them, while the rest of the aggressors enter the opponent's field and try to put themselves in a good position to move the ball forward
 quarterbaque ke paas kuch hi kshan hote hai jisamen use faisalaa karnaa hota he: kis saathi ko gend phenken yaa phir khud rasta dhundta hua aage bhaage
 In a few moments, the defending players of the count, who defend him, reach the quarterback by banging or pushing them
 agar gend quarterbaque ke haath main ho or use daboch diya jaae to ise "sac" kehete hai or kisi bhi quarterbaque ke liye yah bahut sharmnaak mana jaataa he
 Being sacked more often means that the quarterback was unable to think between skirmishes: he is weak and not capable of leading the aggressors
 chaahe quarterbaque gend kisi ko phenke, chaahe khud use lekar bade, aam taur se rakshak thodi hi duuri par gendwale aakraamak khilaadi ko dha hi lete hai or gend ruk jaati he
 This condition is called down
 aakraamakon kaa kaam he kii 4 dounon main gend ko kam-se-kam 10 gaz badhayen
 If they cannot do so, the defenders are taken possession of the ball and the defenders now become aggressive and the offensive defenders
 gend kaa qabza tab bhi badal jaataa he agar kisi aakraamak ke haath se khelte hue gend chhot jaae or koi rakshak us hilti hue gend ko pakad le yaa phir quarterbaque kisi anya aakraamak khilaadi ko gend phenke or koi rakshak bich main aakar use pakad le 
 In the event of a fumble or interception, the defender who has caught the ball may immediately start running towards the opponent's endzone and run until it is dropped, pushed out of the ground, or he Do not score points for your team by reaching the endzone
 jab gend ruukti he to yah bade dhyaan se mapa jaataa he kii 100 gaz ke maidan main yah kaunse gaz par he
 The next play is started in the middle of the field at the same Ghaz
 is jagah ko "bhidane kii lakeer" kaha jaataa he
 As stated, the aim of the offensive team is that the ball moves 10 yards in four or less downs
 farz kijiye ke ve do hi dounon main gend ko 10 gaz aage badha len
 So it is said that he is again on the first down and now he has to raise the ball 10 yards in four downs again with this new scrimmage streak
 yah silsilaa tab tak chalata he jab tak aakraamak rakshakon ke oundzon tak na pahunch jaaen yaa galati karke virdohi ko gend kaa qabza na de den
 Players are also changed in the game which is interrupted when the occupation is changed
 bahut se aakraamak khilaadi daudane main or phenki gai gend pakadaney main nipun hote hai or aksar unke sharir halake hote hai
 Many defenders are terrific and most offensive-specific players are difficult to pick up if they are caught or slammed
 acha aakraamak vahi he jise quarterbaque dwaara phenki gai gend ko bina galati ke pakadana aata ho or jo bhaagate hue rakshakon ko chakma dete hue dushman ke kshetra main dur tak gend badha sake
 The job of some aggressors is to take on defenders so that others can take the offensive ball forward

 Kavalam Madhav Panikkar was a scholar, journalist, historian, administrator and diplomat of India
 ve sardaar ke em panikkar ke naam se adhik prasiddh hai
 The name of Sardar KM Panikkar is definitely mentioned in modern diplomats of India
 panikkar china main lambe samay tak bharat ke rajdoot rahe
 He believed that the birth of diplomacy is related to the birth of modern states in Europe
 rajnay kii paribhaasha dete hue panikkar ne kaha, ”anterrashtriya raajnneeti main prayukt rajnay apane hiton ko duusare deshon se agrim rakhane kii ek kala he
 “diplomacy is an art by which the states of the world cultivate their mutual relations and serve their interests
 panikkar ke anusaar rajanyajna ”ek desh kaa duusare desh main sthit aankh or kaan he
 “A country, through its diplomats, keeps making necessary changes to its foreign policy by getting information about the events, policies and outlook of another country
 bahut se vichaarkon ne chaaturya, kushalta, kapat aadi ko rajanyik gun mana he jabaki panikkar ke anusaar dhoortta, kapat aadi se purna rajnay apane desh ke prati duusare deshon kii shubh kaamana praapt karne kii drushti se prerit hota he or kapat aadi is uddeshy ke maarg main khatarnaak saadhan he
 Good luck of another country, there can be more than four ways to achieve the goal of achievement - other countries should understand the policies of that country properly and have a sense of respect for it, that country should understand the legitimate interests of the people of other countries
 And consider it paramount and he should behave honestly
 aap bahut se logon ko sadaa ke liye dhokhe main nahin rakh sakate
 When the reality of the country's policy is revealed, the level of that country in the world society will be pushed
 panikkar kaa mat he ki vyaktigat jivan kii bhanti anterrashtriya jivan main bhi eemaandaaree sabase acchhee niti he
 Panikkar considered swearing towards the state an essential quality of a diplomat
 unheen ke shabdon main, ”rajdoot ko us niti ko kriyanvit karnaa hota he, jo uski sarkaar nirdhaarit karti he
 This may be different from his own consultations because the government of a country is familiar with the whole situation while the ambassador knows only his specific goals
 isliye jab use un anudeshon ko kriyanvit karnaa padataa he jo aadharbhoot rup se uske vichaaron ke viruddh ho to use bhaavana, pakshpaat athwa maitribhav se prabhavit nahin hona chaiye or kisi bhi sthiti main use sambandhit sarkaar ko apane netra timatimaane ke dwaara bhi yah prakat nahin karnaa chaiye ki uske swayan ke vichaar bhinn nahin he
 The ideal ambassador should not under any circumstances give a rough estimate of the behavior of his government by softening the strict instructions from his country even if the state does not like his country's foreign policy acceptor
 panikkar jo swayan ek safal rajanyigya the, striyon ke sanidhya va sampark ko rajnay kaa sahaayak maanate hai
 In 1926, French Ambassador Jules Camban wrote in an article that the connection of honorable women would be beneficial to the Ambassador

 According to Panikkar, an ideal ambassador should not be proud of his success and despair at failure
 panikkar ne rajdoot ke do mul kaaryon se sahmati vyakti kii hai- pratham, apni sarkaar ko sthaneey paristhitiyon tathaa vahaan kii nitiyon se avgat karaae rakhana
 Second is to successfully follow the orders from the country for the implementation of the foreign policy of our country

 Panikkar is of the view that the most dreadful and final method of pressure behind negotiations is war
