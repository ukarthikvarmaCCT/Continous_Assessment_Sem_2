 Shriharsha had a poetic talent of high order and was the best poet of ornate style
 ve shringaar ke kala paksh ke kavi the
 Sriharsha was a great poet as well as a great philosopher
 ‘khandan-khand-khaadya’ naamak granth main unhone advait mat kaa pratipaadan kiya
 The principles of justice have also been refuted in this
 sriharsh, bharavi kii parampara ke kavi the
 He created his work for scholars, not ordinary humans
 is baat kii unhen tanik bhi chintaa nahin thi ki saamaanya jan unki rachana kaa anadar karenge
 He himself admits that he has included esoteric elements in many places in his poetry, which only the Pandits can understand
 at: panditon kii drushti main to unka kavy magh tathaa bharavi se bhi badhkar he
 But modern scholars call it a repository of artificiality
 mahakavi sriharsh kii mata kaa naam maamll devli or pita kaa 'heerpandit' tha
 He was crowned by both King Vijayachandra of Gahadwalvanshi Kashi and his son King Jayachandra
 raja kanyakubjeshwar kahe jate the, yadhyapi unki rajdhani baad main chalakar kaashi main ho gai thi

 It is also said that poetic lightist 'mammat' was his maternal uncle who introduced Sri Harsha to some of the faults that came in the 'naishadha epic'
 sriharsh keval kavyanirmaan kii vilakshan pratibha se hi sampann na the apitu ve ucch koti ke darshan-shaastra marmajna bhi the
 Sukumar was able to create a classical text, as confirmed by his adult arguments, in the form of a literary literature, as his voice unabashed luxury appears
 pandit mandali main prasiddh janashruti ke anusaar taarkikshiromani udaynacharya ko bhi unhone shastrarth main parajeet kiya tha
 Sriharsha's treatise titled 'khandankhandakhadyam', refuting the principles of justice with the rational method of Naiyayikas, is considered to be the most excellent and mature work of Advaita Vedanta
 iske atirikt 'stheryavichaarprakaran' or 'shivshaktisiddhi' naamak do darshanik granthon kaa sriharsh ne nirmaan kiya tha
 He was also the pioneer of the three Pravastikavis named 'vijay Prasasti', 'gaudovinskulprashasti' and 'chindaprashasti' and 'arnav narration' and 'navasankashankrit' Champu poems
 sriharsh kaa 'naishadhiyacharit' 'brihattrayee' main brihattam mahakavy he
 As a superlative epic of poetical and ornate poetry style, full of the utmost classical classical Vaidusya, poetic and embellished with poetic imagination, the 'nadiadhika Charitra' has a unique place in the Sanskrit epics
 'bharavi' ke kiratarjunium se aarambh alankaranpradhan sayas kavyrachana style kaa charmotkarsh naishadhiyacharit main viksit he
 The story of this epic, taken from the Nalopakhyana of Mahabharata, describes Nal and Damayanti's antecedents, viraha, swayamvara, marriage and navadampatimilan and sangamkali
 prasangat: anya madhyaagat vishay bhi kavyprabandh main gunfit hai
 There are more than 150 verses of many cantos of this giant poem with 22 cantos
 parantu iskaa varnya kathanak kavyakaar ke anupaat main chota he
 Its poetry is big because of the description and detail in the intermittent episodes, when there is a slight concentration in the story
 chaar sargon main nal kaa shrotranurag, poorvaragajanya virah, hansamilan kaa dautya, damayanthivirah aadi maatr varnit he
 Indra, Agni, Varuna, Yama go to Damayanti as a messenger to enlighten any of these four deities, extinguish it and fail in messenger work - the same story is described from 5 to 9 cantos to the tenth canto
 From the sixteenth canto, sangopang, damayanti swayamvara, nalavaran and vivahadi are given
 satrahavaan sarg kali or devon ke bich samvaad he jisamen naastikwaad or uskaa khandan he
 The first encounter of the newly married couple is described in the eighteenth canto
 shesh chaar sargon main-raja rani kii dincharya, vilaas vihaar aadi ke saras vivaran prastut kiye gaye hai

 is kavy kaa mukhya varnyapravah shringaar ras he
 The same rasadhara, with various sub-sections and infinite wavelengths, is moving, no matter how slow its movement from place to place
 dandi aadi kavyashastriyon ke mahakavy-lakshananusaar hi praaia: adhikansh varnyavishay gunfit hai

 Numerous delineation of narrative with illusion, imaginative flight of the imagination, lifelike drawing of nature, proper investment of sentiments, graceful aesthetics on the ornamentation of the llenarum, newness extravagance in the Earth-plum, extraordinary authority over the dictionary of the Sanskrit language, poignant and mature combinations of the classical sides, The quintessential genius of ornamenting miracles, Valasic and upper class WM is due to unprecedented power in stunning portrayal of Sukvihar etc
 sanskrit-panditmondli the sriharsha poet who enjoyed the reputation he is missing the other

 The light of the maturity of the philosophical and classical knowledge in the presented form is scattered everywhere in poetry
 ve advait vedant hi nahin tantra, yoga, nyaay, mimasaa aadi ke bhi praudh marmajna the
 But the philosophy of philosophy has also assisted in the flow of emotionality of his poet's heart from time to time
 in sabake saath drishyjagat kii swaabhaavik sahaj chhaviyon main bhi unka man rama rahaa
 The natural and unrelated forms, efforts, and trades of the swan exposed to the tap in the first canto have been marked - in their dispositions the determination to nature is targeted
 inhen sab vaishishton ke kaaran sriharsh ko vilakshan pratibhashali, shaastramarmajna, aprastut vidhaan main param samarth or alankaran kavyrachana main atinipun mahakavi kaha gaya he
 Similar to Valmiki, Kalidas, etc
, he has his own special importance and place as a poet due to his erudition and mastery of art, even though there is no special affection in the ease of Bhavlok

 Nagarjuna was the eminent Buddhist master of nihilism and the awardee of secondary opinion
 yuvan chwanu ke yatravivaran se pataa chalata he ki ye mahakaushal ke antargat vidarbha desh main utpann hue the
 Indication of his emergence during the reign of a Shalivahana king of the Andhra Bhadra clan is available in Chinese texts
 is naresh ke vyaktitv ke vishay main vidwaanon main aikamaty nahin hai
 In 401 AD, Kumarjee translated a biography of Nagarjuna composed in Sanskrit in Chinese
 falat: inkaa aavirbhaavkaal isse purvavarti hona siddh hota he
 The majority of scholars do not consider the said Shalivahana king different from King Gautamiputra Yajnashree
 nagarjun ne is shaasha ke paas jo upadeshmay patr likhaa tha, vah tibeti tathaa chini anuwaad main aaj bhi uplabdh he
 King Yajnashree Nagarjuna is considered a contemporary ruler even if not specifically mentioned in this letter
 buddha dharm kii shiksha se sanwalit yah patr saahitiyik drushti se bada hi rochak, aakarshak tathaa manoram he
 The name of this letter was - "arya Nagarjuna Bodhisattva Suhrilkh"

 In Tibetan language, "certification" and in Chinese language remedy Kaushalya Hridaya Nagarjuna's compositions are considered
 nagarjun kii rachanaayen apni style tathaa yukti ke liye atyant prakhyat hai
 These are the texts which gained fame in these works - pramanvighatan athwa pramanvidhwanson, jisamen gautam ke shodash padaarthon ke rup tathaa lakshan kaa khandan kiya gaya he

 These types of compositions are available in Buddhist literature by which the Buddhist masters preached the principles of Buddhism to any of their recognized disciples or to Tatvajinigasu

 Nagarjuna is a repository of erudition, pervasive philosophicalism, excellent rationality and innovative imagination
 This sublime treatise which has the distinction of being adorned by adult practices like Acharya's grand work Prajnapradipa - and Acharya Chandrakirti's "prasannapada"
 27 prakarnon main vibhakt yah granth karikaon main hi nibaddh he
 It has also been published in the original translation from Leningrad to Nagarakshara with Prasannapada
 nagarjun kii drushti main mul tatv shunya ke atirikt anya kuch nahin he
 The point to note is that this zero is not a prohibitive object to be dealt with
 kisi bhi padaarth kaa swarupanirnay karne main chaar hi kotiyon kaa prayog sambhavya he - asti, naasti, tadubhayam tathaa nobhayam 
 Paramarth is free from these four categories and that's why we use the word "zero" for its designation
 nagarjun ke shabdon main- Nagarjuna has used subversive reasoning for the attainment of nihilism - that logic, with the help of analyzing matter, it only remains in the void
 is tark ke bal par dravya, gati jati, kaal, sansarg, aatma, aadi tatwon kaa bada hi gambhir, maarmik tathaa moulik vivechan karne kaa shrey nagarjun ko he
 In this opinion, there are two types of truth - Conventional truth and Transcendental truth in which the first indicates the practical power arising from ignorance; The second wisdom is the exponent of truth generated
 "sanvruti" shabd kaa arth he avidya
 Being indistinguishable, practical truth is known as communicative truth
 satya kii yah dwividh vyakhya nagarjun kii drushti main shoonyavad ke dwaara udbhavit nutan kalpana nahin he, pratyut buddha ke dwaara hi pracheen kaal main sanketit kii gai he
 Some of Buddha's teachings are given on the basis of practical truths; Other sermons are postponed above the orthodox truth
 abhisht donon he buddha ko - Nagarjuna, despite being a philosopher, was not a teacher who ignored behavior
 ve jaanate hai ki vyavhaar kaa bina aashray liye parmarth kaa upadesh hi nahin ho saktaa or parmarth kii prapti ke abhaav main nirvana mil nahin saktaa
 The intellect of ordinary human beings is so obsessed with behavior that behavior cannot be practiced to bring it to the altar
 falat: vyavhaar kii asatyata parmarth shabdon ke dwaara pratipaadya vastu nahin he
 That is why he is known by the designation of "illiteracy"
 parmarthatatv buddhivyapaar itani aasakt he ki use parmarth path par laane ke liye vyavhaar kaa aplaap nahin kiya ja saktaa
 As a result, by showing "untruth" of behavior, a seeker has to be distinguished in charity
 parmarth shabdon ke dwaara pratipaadya vastu nahin he
 That is why we know him by designation of the non-literal element
 parmarthatatv buddhivyapaar se agochar, avishay, sarvaprapanchanirmukt tathaa kalpanavirahit he, parantu uske upar jaagtik padaarthon kaa samarope karne se hi uskaa gyaan hamen ho saktaa he
 This element bears an extreme resemblance to the overthrow and exception of Vedantis
 arya nagarjun ke naam se vaidyak, rasayan vidya tathaa tantra ke granth bhi uplabdh hote hai
 Certain scholars consider the philosopher Nagarjuna to be extremely integral to the Tantric Nagarjuna, but the majority of scholars favor the difference between the two
 isi se arya nagarjun se bhinnata dikhalaane ke hetu tantric nagarjun "siddhanagarjun" ke naam se abhihit kiye jate hai
 There is also a substantial difference in the timing of the two
 arya nagarjun kaa aavirbhaav dwitiya shatee ke uttarardh main hua tha, jab ki siddh nagarjun kaa samay saptam shatee ke aas paas sweekaar kiya jaataa hai
 Nagarjuna's Tibetan name is - on the authenticity of Clus-groove and Taranath, they are said to be contemporaries of King Nemichandra who ruled around 300 AD, but this view is not authentic

 Therefore, at an early age, he was interested in righteous conduct, simple, well-organized and professional life

 For nine years after leaving university, Kant moved to a village called Judskin, 60 miles from Königsberg
 vahaan vah do teen pariwaron main adhyaapan kaary kar apni jeevika chalaata or bhautikashastra tathaa darshan main swadhyay karata rahaa
 In the meantime, many of his articles and epics were published, two of which are "special Considerations on the Approximation of Living Powers" and "general Natural History and Theory of the Akash"

 He had also submitted the necessary arrangements for the degree of "doctor's Legacy" in 1755 AD and the University of Königsberg certified his qualification by granting him the said degree

 Pleased with his nine years of hard work, the university had appointed him a distinguished lecturer, but he did not get paid for this work

 Even after 1796 AD, he was busy studying, thinking and writing, but these eight years of his life were spent in a very pathetic condition

 parmparik reeti rivaaj jaise theyam, mudiattem or kerala kii marshall kalaayen nrity ko vartmaan swaroop main laane ke liye mahatvpurn bhoomika nibhaati hai
 The dance form of Kathak is recognized by the rhythmic footsteps, the Vihangam Chakkar, with more than 100 ghungars tied to the feet, and a dramatic rendition of themes from Persian and Urdu poetry, in addition to Hindu religious stories
 kathak kaa janm uttar main hua kintu persian or muslim prabhaav se yah mandir kii reeti se darbari manoranjan tak pahunch gaya
 The style of Kathak originated in the traditional re-enumeration of the Hindus by Brahmin priests, who were called Kathikas, who used haw expressions in a dramatic way
 kramash: isamen katha kehane kii style or adhik viksit hui tathaa ek nrity rup ban gaya
 After the arrival of the Mughals in North India, the dance was taken to the royal court and developed into a sophisticated kalarupa, patronized by the Mughal rulers, and Kathak took its present form
 is nrity main ab dharm kii apeksha saundarya bodh par adhik bal diya gaya

 This is the origin of Metai Jagoi
 aaj ke samay tak jab manipuri log nrity karte hai ve kadam teji se nahin rakhte balki apane pairon ko bhoomi par komalta or mriduta ke saath rakhte hai
 The original misconceptions and stories are still narrated by the Metai priests or Mibis as Mibis which are the root of Manipuri

 It was a unique bank of its kind which was run by the Government of British India and Bengal on common stock

 These three banks remained the principal banks of modern India until they were merged with the Imperial Bank of India on 28 January 1921

 As a result, State Bank of India was established on 1 July 1944, in which the government holds 61

 But for a long time, especially at the time until the three presidency banks had the right to issue notes, bank notes and government deposits were mostly the investible instruments of the banks

 Loans were made in lieu of opium, indigo, salt, woolen cloth, cotton, cotton yarn, spinning machine and silk goods, etc
 But the boom in finance through cash loans started only from the third decade of the nineteenth century

 Among the borrowers by depositing company papers, the borrowers were predominantly Indian, while the business of discounting on private and pay bills was basically monopolized by European citizens and their participating institutions

 There were significant changes in the terms of operation of the Bank of Bengal, Bombay and Madras after 1860
 1861 ke paper karency act ke paarit ho jane se presidency bainkon kaa mudra jari karne kaa adhikaar samaapt kar diya gaya tathaa 1 march 1862 se britain shasit bharat main kaagazi mudra jari karne kaa mul adhikaar bharat sarkaar ko praapt ho gaya
 The responsibility of managing and operating the new paper currency was entrusted to the Presidency Banks and the Government of India took the responsibility of transferring deposits in the treasury to the banks where the banks would open their branches
 tab tak teenon presidency bainkon kii koi shakha nahin thi jabaki unke samvidhan ke antargat unhen yah adhikaar praapt tha
 But as soon as the three presidency banks got assurance of using the deposits in the treasury without interruption, they started to open branches of the bank at those places rapidly
 san 1876 tak teenon presidency bainkon kii shakhaayen, abhikaran va up-abhikaranon ne desh ke pramukh kshetron tathaa bharat ke bhitari bhaagon main sthit vyapaar kendro main apana vistaar kar liya
 Bank of Bengal had 18 branches including its headquarters, temporary branches, and sub-agencies while Bank of Bombay and Madras each had 15 branches
 1 may 1876 se lagu presidency banks act ke dwaara vyavsaay par ekasmaan pratibandhon ke saath teen presidency bainkon ko ek samaan kanoon ke antargat laayaa gaya
 However, the ownership relationship of the government was terminated despite the banks having custody of public debt offices in three presidency towns and a portion of government deposits
 is act dwaara kalakatta, bombai evam madras main teen arakshit koshon ke srijan kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya jahaan presidency bainkon ko keval unke pradhan karyaalayon main rakhane ke liye nirdhaarit nunatam raashi se adhik kii jamaarashiyaan rakhi jaati thim
 The government could lend to the presidency banks from these reserve funds, but these banks saw it as a grace rather than a right

 Despite the slow pace of expansion in the last decade, there has been a steady increase in the case of Bank of Madras, as the bank benefited mainly from the trade between several cities adjoining the port of the Presidency and the inner centers of the country

 The three presidency banks were both beneficiaries and promoters of this process of commercialization as they became practically involved in financing every business, manufacturing and quarrying activity of the sub-continent
 bengal evam bombai ke bank bade aadhunik vinirmaan udyogon ke vittaposhan main lage the, jabaki bank of madras laghu udyogon kaa vittaposhan karne laga jaise anyatra kahin bhi hota nahin tha
 But these three banks were kept away from any foreign exchange related business

 Till the formation of Reserve Bank of India in the year 1935, these banks were kept away from this business

 But behind this formation was a discussion on the need of the State Bank of India for years
 ant main ek mili-juli sanstha ubhar kar saamne ai jo vanijyik bank evam ardh-kendriya bank ke kaary nishpadit karti thi
 With the formation of the Reserve Bank of India as the central bank of India in 1935, the role of the semi-central bank of the Imperial Bank came to an end
 imperial bank bharat sarkaar kaa bank na rahakar aise kendron main jahaan kendriya bank nahin he, sarkari vyavsaay ke nishpaadan ke liye bhartiya reserve bank kaa agent ban gaya
 But it continued to operate the depots of currency chests and small coins and to operate the Remittance Facility Scheme for other banks and the public on the terms set by the Reserve Bank of India
 vah bankeron kaa atirikt nakad apane paas rakhkar tathaa praadhikrut pratibhuti par unhen rin dekar unke bank ke rup main bhi kaary karne laga
 The bank also managed clearing houses at many places where the Reserve Bank of India did not have offices
 yah bank sarkaar kii taraf se reserve bank dwaara yojit rajkoshiya bill nilaamiyon main sabase bada nividakarta bhi rahaa
 After the establishment of the Reserve Bank, important amendments were made to its constitution to convert the Imperial Bank into a commercial bank
 uske vyavsaay par purv main lagaae gaye pratibandhon ko hataaya gaya tathaa pehali baar bank ko videshi mudra vyavsaay karne tathaa nishpadak evam nyaasi vyavsaay karne kii anumati di gai
 The Imperial Bank has recorded very impressive growth in the form of offices, reserves, deposits, investments and advances during the three and a half decades since its existence
 kuch maamalon main yah vruddhi chah guna se bhi adhik rahi
 The financial position and security inherited from the predecessors unambiguously provided the bank a solid and robust platform
 imperial bank ne banking kii jis gauravpurn parampara kaa niyamit rup se paalan kiya tathaa apane parichaalanon main jis prakaar kii ucch stareey satyanishtha kaa pradarshan kiya usase jamakartaon main, jis tarah kaa aatmavishvaas tha uski barabari us samay ke kisi bhi bhartiya bank ke liye sambhav nahin thi
 Due to all this, Imperial Bank attained a very special position in the Indian banking industry and also gained an important place in the economic life of the country
 swatantraaa prapti ke samay imperial bank kaa puunji-aadhaar arakshitiyon sahit 11

 Deposits and advances were Rs 275

 varsh 1951 main jab pratham panchavashiya yojana shuru hui to desh ke gramin kshetra ke vikaas ko isamen sarvocch praathamikta di gai
 Till then, the commercial banks of the country, including the Imperial Bank of India, were confined to the urban sector and were not fully prepared to meet the future requirements of economic reconstruction of rural areas

 Accordingly, an Act was passed in Parliament in May 1955 and the State Bank of India was formed on 1 July 1955
 is prakaar bhartiya banking pranali kaa ek chauthai se bhi adhik sansaadhan sarkaar ke sidhe niyantran main aa gaya
 Later, in 1959 the State Bank of India Act was passed which resulted in the State Bank of India acquiring eight associate banks of the erstwhile states as subsidiaries, thus leading to the emergence of the State Bank of India with a new obligation of social purpose

 Kuntiputra Dharmaraja Yudhishthira started saying that, o God, i have heard the blessings of Ashadha Shukla Devshayani Ekadashi and Chaturmasya Mahatmya
 ab krupa karke shravan krishna ekadshi kaa kya naam he, so bataaie
 Lord Krishna started saying, o Yudhishthira! Once upon a time, Lord Brahma himself told the story of this Ekadashi to Devarshi Narada, that is what i tell you
 naradji ne brahmaji se poocha tha ki he pitamah! shravan maas ke krishna paksh kii ekadshi kii katha sunne kii meri ichha he, uskaa kya naam he? kya vidhi he or uskaa mahatmaya kya he, so krupa karke kahie
 Hearing these words of Naradji, Brahma said - o Narada! You have asked a very beautiful question for the interest of the people
 shravan maas kii krishna ekadshi kaa naam kamika he
 Just by listening to it, you get the result of Vajpayee Yagya
 is din shankh, chakra, gadadhari vishnu bhagwaan kaa pujan hota he, jinke naam shridhar, hari, vishnu, madhav, madhusudan hai
 Listen to the fruits that result from worshiping them
 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The fruit which is obtained from the bathing of Ganga, Kashi, Naimisharanya and Pushkar, is obtained by worshiping Lord Vishnu
 jo fal surya va chandra grahan par kurukshetra or kaashi main snaan karne se, samudr, van sahit prithvi daan karne se, singh raashi ke brihaspati main godavari or gandaki nadi main snaan se bhi praapt nahin hota vah bhagwaan vishnu ke pujan se miltaa he
 Those who worship God in Shravan, God, Gandharva and Surya etc
 are all worshiped by them
 at: paapon se darane vaale manushyon ko kamika ekadshi kaa vrath or vishnu bhagwaan kaa pujan avashyamev karnaa chahie
 The fast of this Ekadashi and worship of Lord Vishnu is very important for people trapped in the mud of sin and immersed in the ocean of the world
 isse badhkar paapon ke naashon kaa koi upaay nahin he
 Hey Narada! God Himself has said that the creature does not get Kuyoni by fasting
 jo manushya is ekadshi ke din bhakthipurvak tulsi dal bhagwaan vishnu ko arpan karte hai, ve is sansar ke samast paapon se dur rahete hai
 Lord Vishnu is not so happy with the gemstone, pearl, gem and jewelery etc
 as much as the Tulsi group
 tulsi dal pujan kaa fal chaar bhaar chaandi or ek bhaar swarna ke daan ke baraabar hota he
 Hey Narada! i always greet the Tulsi, the beloved of God
 tulsi ke paudhe ko seenchne se manushya kii sab yatnaayen nasht ho jaati hai
 With the mere sight, all sins are destroyed and a person becomes pure by touch
 kamika ekadshi kii raatri ko dipadaan tathaa jaagran ke fal kaa mahatmaya chitragupta bhi nahin kah sakate
 Those who light a lamp in the temple of God on the night of this Ekadashi, their ancestors take amritpana in heaven and those who light a lamp of ghee or oil, light it with hundred crores of lamps and go to the sun
 brahmaji kehete hai ki he naarad! brahmahatya tathaa bhrun hatya aadi paapon ko nasht karne vaali is kamika ekadshi kaa vrath manushya ko ytn ke saath karnaa chahie
 a person who listens to and observes the fasting of Kamika Ekadashi goes to Vishnu Lok free from all sins
 jo fal ganga, kaashi, naimisharany or pushkar snaan se miltaa he, vah vishnu bhagwaan ke pujan se miltaa he
 The fruit which is not obtained by bathing in Kurukshetra and Kashi on sun and lunar eclipse, donating earth including sea, forest, Godavari in Jupiter of Leo zodiac and bathing in Gandaki river also gets worship from Lord Vishnu
 jo manushya shravan main bhagwaan kaa pujan karte hai, unase devtaa, gandharva or surya aadi sab poojit ho jate hai
 Therefore, humans who are afraid of sins, must observe Kamika Ekadashi fast and worship Lord Vishnu
 paparupi keechad main phase hue or sansarrupi samudr main duube manushyon ke liye is ekadshi kaa vrath or bhagwaan vishnu kaa pujan atyant aavashyak he
 Beyond this, there is no way to destroy sins
 he naarad! swayan bhagwaan ne yahi kaha he ki kamika vrath se jeev kuyoni ko praapt nahin hota
 People who devoutly offer Tulsi party to Lord Vishnu on this Ekadashi stay away from all sins of this world
 vishnu bhagwaan ratna, moti, mani tathaa aabhushan aadi se itane prasann nahin hote jitne tulsi dal se
 What is the story behind the fast ek gaanv main ek vir shratriya rahata tha
 One day, due to some reason, he got scrambled with a Brahmin and the Brahmin died
 apane haathon mare gayi brahaman kii kriya us shratriya ne kerani chaahi
 But the pundits refused him to participate in the action
 brahamanon ne bataaya ki tum par braham hatya kaa dosha he
 First, make atonement and get rid of this sin, then we will eat at your house
 is par shratriya ne poocha ki is paap se mukt hone ke kya upaay he
 Then the Brahmins told that by observing the fast and worshiping Lord Shridhar with devotion on Krishna Ekadashi of the month of Shravan month, by getting food to the Brahmins and getting blessings with Sadashrina, one will get rid of this sin
 panditon ke bataaye hue tareeke par vrath karaane vaali raat main bhagwaan shridhar ne shratriya ko darshan dekar kaha ki tumhen braham hatya ke paap se mukti mil gai he
 Cleanliness has special significance in Kamika Ekadashi
 vrati vyakti praat: snanadi karke bhagwaan vishnu kii pratimaa ko panchamrita se snaan karaayen
 The statue should be bathed with pure Ganges water before taking bath with Panchamrit
 panchamrita main doodh, dahi, ghi, shahad or shakkar shaamil he
 After taking bath, use the smell, good Indra barley and offer flowers to God
