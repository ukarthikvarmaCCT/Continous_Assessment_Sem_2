 The creation of holograms requires the recording of fine details, so it is made through laser light

 Because holograms are seen in normal light, laser rays with these special wavelengths make the hologram bright
 hologram par chitra praapt karne ke liye do alag alag tarangadairghy vaali lager kirnon ko ek photographic plate par ankit kiya jaataa he
 Before this, both laser rays pass through a beam spreader, causing the light of the laser rays on the plate to be like a flashlight and imprint the image
 isse ek hi jagah do chhaviyaan praapt hoti hai
 That is, through laser light on the same base, two different shapes are inscribed in such a way that different shapes are seen when the viewer views the hologram from different angles
 maanav aankh dwaara jab hologram ko dekha jaataa he to vah donon chhaviyon ko milakar mastishk main sanket bhejti hai, jisase mastishk ko uske triayami hone kaa bhram hota he
 When the hologram is ready, it is printed on silver plates

 In these we can consider the origin of boat or ship

 Just as the canoe does not contain water, but it has neither the same carrying capacity as the fleet nor the stability

 As people learned the art of adding wooden planks, even though they were cut from axes, and were made out of a rough shape, they also started building water-repellent boats

 Long-term blood pressure control is mainly dependent on the kidneys
 mukhyatah aisa koshiketar drav upkhand ke anurakshan ke madhyam se hota he, jiskaa aakar plasma sodium sandrata par nirbhar karata he
 However, the kidneys cannot directly estimate blood pressure, but changes in the delivery of sodium and chloride to the distal parts of the nephron alter the secretion of the renal fermentin used by the kidney

 At that time the color of the earth's seas was green because a large amount of iron compounds were dissolved in them
 in samudron main faile shaiwal ne oxigen utpann kiya jisane is lohe se milakar magnetic bana diya
 Gradually, the color of the seas began to clear
 jab samudr se adhiktar loha hat chukaa tha to is oxigen ko sokhne ke liye kuch nahin bachaa, jis se prithvi ke vayumandal main - jahaan ab tak methane gas kii badi bhoomika thi - oxigen kii maatra badhane lagi
 Most of the organisms that had evolved on Earth until then were inexperienced anaerobics that thrive in low-oxygen air, and most of them went extinct due to the lack of this oxygen concentration
 oxigen badhati rahi or vayumandal main methane kii sandrata ghatati rahi
 This had a huge impact on temperature because methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than oxygen, and prevents heat from the sun more at the atmosphere and surface
 bahut se jeevvaigyanik va bhuvaigyanik maanate hai ki is se huronian himyug armbh hua, jo prithvi kaa sabase lambaa va bhayankar himyug tha, jisamen ek samay par sambhav he ki prithvi puri tarah se himchaadaron se dhaki gai ho
 This whole event is known as the Great Oxygen Holocaust
 aage chalakar jaise oxigen-shwaasai jeev utpann hue oxigen kii maatra main santulan aa gaya
 Poetry, poetry or poetry, is the genre of literature in which a story or emotion is artistically expressed by a language
 bharat main kavita kaa itihaas or kavita kaa darshan bahut purana he
 Its beginning can be understood from Bharatmuni
 kavita kaa shabdic arth he kaavyatmak rachana yaa kavi kii kriti, jo chhandon kii shrunkhalaaon main vidhivat baandhi jaati he
 Poetry is the syntax that makes the mind complete with any juices or impulses
 arthath vahjisamen chune hue shabdon ke dwaara kalpana or manovegon kaa prabhaav daalaa jaataa he
 In Rasgangadhar the exponent of the meaning of 'delightful' is called 'poetry'
 'arth kii romaniyata' ke antargat shabd kii romaniyata bhi samajhakar log is lakshan ko sweekaar karte hai
 But 'elegance' of 'earth' can be of many types
 isse yah lakshan bahut spasht nahin he
 Literature is the most appropriate sign of the poet Vishwanath
 uske anusaar 'rasaatmak vaakya hi kavy he'
 Ras is the soul of poetry of pleasant communication of the souls
 kavyprakash main kavy teen prakaar ke kahe gaye hai, dhwani, gunibhoot vyangy or chitra
 Sound is one in which the hidden meaning is dominant, rather than the meaning derived from the words
 gunibhoot byangy vah he jisamen gaun ho
 a picture or an ornament is one in which a miracle is done without exorcism
 in teenon ko kramshah uttam, madhyam or adham bhi kehete hai
 The poetic lighter's emphasis seems to be more on the hidden sense, not on the stimulus of the juice
 kavy ke do or bhed kiye gaye hai, mahakavy or khand kavy
 The epic canto and its hero must be a deity, king, or Dhirodatta, a rich Kshatriya
 usamen shringaar, vir yaa shant rason main se koi ras pradhan hona chahie
 Periodic compassion; Humor etc
 and juices and other people's references should also come
 kam se kam aath sarg hone chahie
 In the epic, the place of Sandhya, Surya, Chandra, Ratri, Prabhat, Mrigaya, Mountains, Forest, Ritu, Sagar, Sanyog, Vipralambha, Muni, Pur, Yajna, Ranprayana, Vivah etc
 should be imminent
 kavy do prakaar kaa mana gaya he, drishy or shravy
 Visual poetry is that which is shown by acting, such as drama, skit, etc
 which is readable and listenable, it is audible
 shravy kavy do prakaar kaa hota he, gadhy or padya
 The epic and Khandakavya of the verse poetry have been called two distinctions
 gadhy kavy ke bhi do bhed kiye gaye hai- katha or aakhyayika
 Champu, Virud and Karambhaka are considered three types of poetry and poetry
 saamanyat: sanskrit ke kavy-sahitya ke do bhed kiye jate hai- drishy or shravy
 In addition to visual poetic words, the costumes, gestures, motifs, actions and performances of the characters bring excitement to the audience's heart
 drishykavy ko 'roopak' bhi kehete hai kyonki uskaa rasaswadan netron se hota he
 Audible poetry communicates juice to the heart of readers and listeners through words
 shravyakavy main padya, gadhy or champoo kaavyon kaa samavesh kiya jaataa he
 The word 'padya', which is removed from the padma in the motion, indicates the primacy of motion
 at: padyakavy main taal, lay or chand kii vyavastha hoti he
 Again there are two strains of the verse - the epic and the Khandakavya
 khandakavy ko ‘muktkavy’ bhi kehete hai
 In the Khandakavya, instead of a complete chronicle of life like the epic, one part is described
 kavitv ke saath-saath sangitatkata kii pradhanta hone se hi inako hindi main ‘geetikavy’ bhi kehete hai
 The meaning of 'geeti' is to express the emotional spirit of the heart in a phased manner
 geeti kii aatma bhavatirek he
 The poet of his emotional sensation and imagination makes the narrative emotional
 geetikavy main kavyashastreey roodhiyon or paramparaon se mukt hokar vaiyaktik anubhav ko saralata se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 By nature, the shape-type of lyrical poetry is smaller than the epic
 in sab tattvon ke sahyog se sanskrit muktakkavy ko ek utkrisht kavyarup mana jaataa he
 Muktakavya has become more popular than the epics
 sanskrit main geetikavy muktak or prabandh donon roopon main praapt hota he
 The best example of managerial lyricism is Meghdoot
 adhikansh prabandh geetikavy isi ke anukaran par likhe gayi hai
 Muktak is that in which each verse is independent in itself
 iske sundar udhaaharan amaruukshatak or bhatruharishtakatray hai
 Musical verses are characteristic of melodious verse lyrics
 shringaar, niti, vairaygy or prakruti iske pramukh pratipaadya vishay he
 a natural depiction of the beauty and nature of women is found in these poems
 upadesh, niti or lokvyavahaar ke sutara inamen bade hi romantic dhang se praapt ho jate hai
 This is the reason that the Suktikas and Subhashitas are found in abundance in Muktakayas
 muktakkavy kii parampara sfoot sandesh rachanaaon ke rup main vaidic yug se hi praapt hoti he
 In the Rigveda there is a reference to sending a dog named Sarma as messenger
 vaidic muktakkavy ke udaahranon main vasishtha or vamdev ke sookt, ullekhneey hai
 In the Ramayana, Mahabharata and their later texts, this type of sphincter is available in large quantities
 kadachit mahakavi valmiki ke shakodgaaron main yah bhaavana gopit rup main rahi he
 Hanuman, the messenger of Sri Rama sent to husband husbandman Pravasini Sita, Sri Krishna sent by Dharmaraja Yudhishthira towards Duryodhana and messenger Hans sent by King Nal near Sundari Dayamanti are the references counted under this tradition
 is sandarbh main bhagwat puraana kaa venugit vishesh rup se uddharaneey he jisaki rasvibhor karne vaali bhaavana chhavi sanskrit muktakkavyon par ankit he
 Rajasekhar has told in the episode of Kavicharya that the poet should take education of academics and sub-disciplines
 vyakaran, kosh, chand, or alankaar - ye chaar vidyaayein hai
 64 arts are subtexts
 kavitv ke 8 strot hai- swasthya, pratibha, abhyaas, bhakthi, vidwatkatha, bahushrutata, smritidrishta or raag
 Mammatt has stated six purposes of poetry - kavita yaa kavy kya he is vishay main bhartiya sahitya main aalochakon kii badi samrudh parampara he— acharya vishwanath, panditraj jagannatha, pandit ambikadutt vyas, acharya shripati, bhamah aadi sanskrit ke vidwaanon se lekar aadhunik acharya ramchandra shukla tathaa jaishankar prasad jaise prabud kaviyon or aadhunik yug kii mira mahadevi verma ne kavita kaa swaroop spasht karte hue apane apane mat vyakt kiye hai
 Scholars believe that the human heart wanders in the infinite form, trades of the eternal world, but when the human ego abandons the spirit and remains a pure feeling, then it becomes a free heart
 hriday kii is mukti kii sadhana ke liye manushya kii vaani jo shabd vidhaan karti ai he use kavita kehete hai
 Poetry elevates human beings from the narrow circle of selfish relationships and helps in making a raga connection with the rest of creation
 kavy kii anek paribhaashaayen di gai hai
 These definitions also hold true for modern Hindi poetry
 kavy siddh chitt ko alokik anandanubhuti karaata he to hriday ke taar zankrut ho uthte hai
 Poetry also contains the feeling of Satyam Shiva Sundaram
 jis kavy main yah sab kuch paaya jaataa he vah uttam kavy mana jaataa he
 There are two distinctions of poetry: swaroop ke aadhaar par kavy ke do bhed hai - shravyakavy evam drushyakavy
 The poetry which is praised by listening to others or reading by itself is called audible poetry
 jaise ramayana or mahabharat
 Audio poetry also has two distinctions - Prabandha poetry and Muktak poetry
 isamen koi pramukh katha kavy ke aadi se ant tak krambaddh rup main chalati he
 The sequence of the story breaks in the middle and secondary stories become helpful in between
 jaise ramcharita maanas
 There are two distinctions of management poetry - epic and Khandakavya
 1- mahakavy isamen kisi aitihaasik yaa puranic mahapurush kii sampurna jivan katha kaa adyopant varnan hota he
 These things must be in the epic - 2- khandakavy isamen kisi kii sampurna jeevanakatha kaa varnan na hokar keval jivan ke kisi ek hi bhaag kaa varnan hota he
 It is necessary to have these things in the section Poetry- isamen keval ek hi pad yaa chand swatantra rup se kisi bhav yaa ras athwa katha ko prakat karne main samarth hota he
 The songs, poets, doha etc
 are free
 jis kavy kii anandanubhuti abhinay ko dekhakar evam paatro se cathopakathan ko sun kar hoti he use drishy kavy kehete hai
 Like in a drama or a movie
 1- padya kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan kavy main kiya jaataa he, jaise gitanjali 2- Prose Poetry - In this, a story is described in prose, such as Jaishankar's commission
 
 
 gadhy main kavy rachana karne ke liye kavi ko chand shaastra ke niyamon se svachhndatha praapt hoti he
 3- Champu Poetry - It consists of both prose and poetry
 maithilisharan gupt kii 'yashodhara' champu kavy he
 The history of modern Hindi poetry is about 800 years old and its beginning is understood from the thirteenth century
 har bhashaa kii tarah hindi kavita bhi pehle itivrittatmak thi
 That is, a story was tied with a rhythm and decorated with ornaments
 bhartiya sahitya ke sabhi pracheen granth kavita main hi likhe gaye hai
 The specific reason for this was that poetry was easy to memorize due to the rhythm and verses
 jis samay chhapekhane kaa avishkaar nahin hua tha or dastavezon kii anek pratiyaan bananaa aasaan nahin tha us samay mahatvapurn baton ko yaad rakh lene kaa yah sarvottam saadhan tha
 That is why at that time, along with literature, politics, science and Ayurveda were also written in the verse itself
 bharat kii pracheenatam kavitaayen sanskrit bhashaa main rugveda main hai jinamein prakruti kii prashasti main likhe gaye chhandon kaa sundar sankalan hai
 Many other subjects of life have also found place in these poems

 par kai logon kaa maananaa he ki yah galat he evam asamprdayik desh main ek dharm ke liye kiya gaya pakshpaat he
 At a Central Haj Committee meeting in November 2017, it was decided that the Haj subsidy would be completely abolished in 2018 and the funds would be used for educational programs especially for the children of minority community girls

 Mansarovar lake is in Tibet
 Considerable criticism has been leveled against this practice, both by Hindu organizations opposed to state funding of private pilgrimage outside India and by Muslim pressure groups
 As an example of the latter, Mohib Ahmad contends that even Air India's subsidized fare is higher than competing airlines' ordinary fare
 However, the government has continued offering the Haj subsidy despite protests from the Muslim community at large
 Syed Shahabuddin claims that Air India's rising costs for travel, and the consequent increases in the Government of India's subsidy, have resulted partly from differences in foreign exchange rates beyond the airline's control
 He suggests charter fares should be set at two-thirds of regular IATA fares, but points out that the Haj has higher costs than other charters because two empty flights are required to return the aircraft to India and to position the aircraft in Arabia for the pilgrims' return journey
 Shahabuddin maintains that the subsidy ought to be phased out because Hindus view the subsidy as preferential treatment of India's Muslim minority
 Other Muslim leaders have argued that the Hajj subsidy is "un-islamic" and that Hajj money should be invested in education and health instead
 Maulana Mahmood Madani, a member of the Rajya Sabha and general secretary of the jamiat-e-ulema-e-hind, declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic Sharia, since the Quran declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources
 Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is unislamic
 Likewise, Hindu groups argue that a government sponsored Hajj subsidy forcibly taxes Hindus to pay for Muslim religious pilgrimages, and tantamounts to appeasement of Islam
 After considerable pressure from Muslim groups and the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Congress government in 2010 decided to begin phasing out the Haj subsidy that had been in operation since 1993
 The Central Haj Committee of India will work through the Ministry of External Affairs to restructure the Air fares so that the richer Hajis will pay a premium for the poorer pilgirms
 The entire restructuring is expected to take about seven years and be completed by 2017
 In August 2010, the Ministry of Minority Affairs formally opposed providing subsidy for Haj pilgrimage, saying the scheme - in operation since 1993 — was contrary to the teachings of Islam
 The Government of India has proposed that starting from 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person will be decreased, and by 2017 will be ended completely
