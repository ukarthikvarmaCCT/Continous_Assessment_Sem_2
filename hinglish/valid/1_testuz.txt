 The Digambara sect then observe Paryusana for 10 days
 unhen ve 'dasalakshan' ke naam se bhi sambodhit karte hai
 The Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra, describes 10 religions
 yah 10 dharm he: These ten religions are worn on the festival of rituals
 yah sab chijen nashvanth he yah sab chijen ek din aap ko chod dengi yaa phir aapako ek din jabaran in chizon ko chhodna hi padega 
nashvanth chizon ke pichhe bhaagane se behatar he ki abhimaan or parigrah sab bure kam main badhotari karte he jinako chhoda jaye or sab se vinamr bhav se pesh aae sab jivo ke prati maitri bhav rakhe kyonki sabhi jivo ko jivan jine kaa adhikaar he 
 Everyone has to go one day or the other, then all these sacrifices should be discarded, and it is better to recognize yourself and meditate on yourself to destroy the sanctions, meditate with sacrifice and throw it into the hearth, because to save them and save peace Spiritual practice is the only option
 aatma gyaan, khushi, prayaas, vishwaas jaise asankhya guno se sinchit he us main itani takat he ki keval gyaan ko praapt kar sake
 uttam aajav dharm hamen sikhaata he ki moh-maaya, bure kam sab chod chad kar saral swabhaav ke saath param anand moksh praapt kar sakate hai 
 The best defecation teaches us that be happy in what you have got from a pure mind, it is possible to attain the ultimate bliss of salvation only by thanking God and making your soul pure
 uttam satya dham hame yahi sikhaata he ki aatma kii prakruti jaanane ke liye satya aavashyak he or iske aadhaar par hi param anand moksh ko praapt karnaa mumkin he 
 apane man aatma ko saral or shuddh bana len to satya apane aap hi aa jayega 
 Like dislike in sab se chhutkaaraa tab hi mumkin he jab apni aatma ko in sab pralobhanon se mukt kare or sthir man ke saath sanyam rakhen 
 isi raah par chalate param anand moksh kii prapti mumkin he 
 It is probably not possible in this era to do penance like our Tirthankaras, but we also have the same sentiment and during the 10 days of Paryushan Pav, we do fasting, meditation and try to walk the path of attaining ultimate bliss salvation
 chhodne kii bhaavana jain dharm main sabase adhik he kyonki jain sant sif gharbaar nahin yahaan tak ki apane kapadey bhi tyaag detaa he or puraa jivan digambar mudra dhaaran karke vyatit karata he 
insaan kii shakti isse nahin parkhi jaati kii uske paas kitni dhan daulat he balki isse parkhi jaati he ki usne kitna chhoda kitna tyaag kiya he ! It is possible to achieve the ultimate bliss salvation by leaving all temptations and attachments
 jaise jameen par sona na ki gadde takiyon par, zarurat se zyada kisi vastu kaa upyog na karnaa, vyay, moh, vaasana naa rakhte saadagi se jivan vyatit karnaa 
koi bhi sant iska paalan karte he or visheshkar jainsnt sharir, jubaan or dimag se sabase zyada iskaa hi paalan karte hai 
 By following Brahmacharya, you will get the knowledge and power of the whole universe, and if you do not do this then you are just a slave to your desires and desires
 is din shaam ko pratikraman karte hue puure saal me kiye gaye paap or katu vachan se kisi ke dil ko jaanate or anjaane thes pahunchi ho to kshamaa yachana karte he 
ek duusare ko kshamaa karte he or ek duusare se kshamaa maangate he or haath jod kar gale milakar michhami dookkadam karte he
 The basic purpose of celebrating Paryushan festival is to focus on the undertakings required to make the soul pure
 paryaavaran kaa shodhan iske liye vaanchhneeya mana jaataa he
 It is not possible to give the soul a pure form without making it neutral or detached to the environment
 is drushti se'kalpasutra' yaa tatwarth sutara kaa vaachan or vivechan kiya jaataa he or sant-muniyon or vidwaanon ke saannnidhya main swadhyay kiya jaataa he
 More and more time is spent in puja, archana, aarti, samagam, renunciation, penance, fasting, and an attempt is made to stay away from daily business and savvy activities
 sanyam or vivek kaa prayog karne kaa abhyaas chalata rahata he
 It is considered necessary to stay for a maximum time in the temple, suburb, place and complex
 vaise to paryushan parv deepawali va christmas kii tarah ullas-anand ke tyohaar nahin hai
 Yet their influence is visible throughout the society
 upwas, bela, tela, aththai, maskhman jaisi lambii binakuch khaae, bina kuch pie, nirjala tapasya karne vaale hajaaron log saraahna praapt karte hai
 Apart from India, Paryushan is celebrated with great pomp in Britain, America, Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany and many other countries
 magar paryushan parv par kshamatkshamapana yaa kshamavani kaa kaarykram aisa he jisase jainetar janata ko kaaphi prerana milti he
 It can be collectively celebrated as world-friendship Day
 paryushan parv ke samaapan par ise manaaya jaataa he
 Ganesh Chaturthi or Rishi Panchami is celebrated as Samvatsari festival
 us din log upwas rakhte hai or swayan ke paapon kii aalochana karte hue bhavishya main unase bachane kii pratigya karte hai
 At the same time, they are roaming around eighty-four million vagaries, apologizing to all the creatures, informing them that they have no hatred for anyone
 paroksh rup se ve yah sankalp karte hai ki ve paryaavaran main koi hastkshep nahin karenge
 Knowing or knowing by mind, speech and body, they will not participate in any violence activity themselves, nor will they ask others to take it and will not approve those who take it
 yah aashwaasan dene ke liye ki unka kisi se koi bair nahin he, ve yah bhi ghoshit karte hai ki unhone vishwa ke samast jeevon ko kshamaa kar diya he or un jeevon ko kshamaa maangane vaale se darane kii jarurat nahin he
 Khammei svawe jeeva, swaywe jeeva khamantu mein
 mittime savv bhues vairan mamajhan na kenai
 This sentence is of course traditional, but has special intent
 iske anusaar kshamaa maangane se zyada jaruri kshamaa karnaa he
 By granting forgiveness, you give gratitude to all other creatures and resolve to protect them
 tab aap sanyam or vivek kaa anusaran karenge, atmik shanti anubhav karenge or sabhi jeevon or padaarthon ke prati maitri bhav rakhenge
 The soul can remain pure only when it does not interfere with its outside and is not distracted by the external element
 kshamaa-bhav iskaa moolmantra he

 a scientist and politician, Kalam earned respect by his humility at home and abroad and became one of the greatest leaders of India

 bharat ke 11 wein raashtrapati ke rup main inke kaarykaal ke dauraan america-bharat sambandhon main abhootpurv vruddhi dekhi gai
 The aptly named "people's President" provided an inspiration to millions of Indians and fans around the world by public service, humility and dedication
 " Kalam was one of those who followed the discipline completely in his personal life
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki ve quran or bhagavad gita donon kaa adhyayan karte the
 Kalam mentions in many places that he also follows Tirukkural, at least one Kural was mentioned in his speeches
 raajnneetik str par kalam kii chahat thi ki antarrashtriya str par bharat kii bhoomika vistaar ho or bharat zyada se jyaad mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaaye
 He wanted to see India moving towards becoming a superpower
 unhone kai preranaaspad pustakon kii bhi rachana kii thi or ve takanic ko bharat ke jansadharan tak pahunchaane kii hameshaa vaqaalat karte rahe thi
 Doctor Qalam was highly popular among children and youth
 vah bhartiya antariksh vigyaan evam praudyogiki santhaan ke kulapati bhi the
 He always smiled even though he was a servant of the office
 ve jeevanabhar shaakaahaari rahe
 Kalam has also literary formally incorporated his ideas into four books, which are as follows: 'india 2020 a Vision for the New Millennium', 'my Journey' and 'ignatied Minds - Unleashing the Power Within India'
 in pustakon kaa kai bhartiya tathaa videshi bhashaaon main anuwaad ho chukaa he
 Thus, he was a distinguished scientist from India, who has received honorary doctorate from more than 40 universities and institutes
 kalam sahab kii pramukh pustaken nimnavat hai: Other writers have written books on various aspects of Kalam's biography or life, some of which are as follows: kalam ke 79 wein janmdin ko sanyukt raashtra dwaara vishwa vidhyaarthee diwas ke rup main manaaya gaya tha

 The elite is more powerful in its field than other sections of society
 saamaajik jivan ke kisi bhi kshetra main niyantrankari sanrachanaon ke sheersh par maujuud chote se or apekshaakrit samroop samooh ko abhijan kii sangya di jaati he
 The Latin word 'ELITE', synonymous with it, means chosen or best
 ilit banane ke liye liye satta, suvidha, yogyata or sanghathan or netritvkaari kshamta hona anivaary he
 In order to continue any system or system, it is considered necessary to run the operations of a group of well-qualified persons and from time to time, people with similar abilities are selected to take their place
 yah aagrah sheersh yaa netritv main abhijan kii nirantarata kii guarantee karata he
 Elite's interpreter Pareto says that Elite possesses special psychological qualities based on power, using notoriety, deceit, strength, and judicious initiative
 chunki abhijanon kaa gut chota sa hota he isliye use adhik sangathit or susangat rup se karrwai karne main aasaani hoti he
 Its members maintain constant contact with each other, so that the policy-making process is not interrupted on the basis of mutual consensus
 aisi baat nahin ki abhijan hameshaa hi apni satta bachaane main kaamyaab rahete hon
 The blame for their failure is usually attributed to lack of political skill or will power
 samaaj ke saath jeevant sampark rakhte hue naye vichaaron ko grahan karke apana punarsanskaar karte rahane vaale abhijan lambe arase tak tike rahete hai
 Those elites who do not do so, their time is over and the counter-elite standing against them takes power from their hands, leading a 'mass' or mass group
 shuru main abhijan siddhanth ek loktantr virdohi avadharana thi jiskaa sutrikaran shaskaon ke praadhikaar ko nyaaysangat tehraane ke kiya gaya tha taaki europe kii viksit ho rahi loktantric shashan paddati kii vaidhata ko chunauti di ja sake
 Later in the middle of the twentieth century, the insights of this theory were tried to confirm the democratic theory
 iske peeche makasad samyavaadee yaa fasivadi netritv main chal rahe janandolanon se udaarataavaadi loktantr ko bachaana tha
 In democracy, not all the elite are in power
 aaj kii loktantric vyavasthaaon main abhijanon ke kai samooh satta kii bagdor apane haath main rakhane ke liye aapas main pratiyogita karte hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 In order to join the membership of the already frozen elite group, new ones keep coming on the platform of democracy
 shuru main abhijanon kaa chayan keval ucch varg se hi kiya jaataa tha, lekin ab nichle or vanchit samajhe jane vaale tabakon kii netritvkaari shaktiyaan bhi abhijanon kii shrenee main shaamil kar lee jaati hai
 The democracy is considered more successful and durable with the size of the elites increasing
 iske vipareet jahaan abhijan apana aakaar badhane ke kilaaf morchabandi kar lete hai, un loktantron main vyavastha baar-baar sankatagrast hoti rahati he
 The eligibility principle is fundamentally based on the ancient belief that society is divided into a handful of rulers and majority ruled
 plato ne shashan karne ke liye aise logon kii shinaakht karne kaa suzav diya tha jinke paas hukumat karne ke liye aavashyak prakruti-pradutt yogyataayen hon
 It is a prevalent way of understanding history and politics to study the elites who have decision-making powers for the operation of various sectors of society
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main italvi samajashastriyon getano moska or wilfredo parato ke saath- saath moska ke german anuyaayi robert michels ne loktantric vyavasthaaon ke vikaas ke kilaaf pratikriya karte hue daawa kiya abhijanon kaa shashan maanviya itihaas ek pramukh lakshan he
 This formulation was against the egalitarian one promoted and confirmed by Marxism in the nineteenth century
 ye siddhantkaar marks se is bare main to sahamat the ki ateet main samaajon kaa netritv alpsankhyakon ke haathon main rahaa he, par unka yah bhi kahana tha ki ye alpsankhyak samooh anivaary taur par utpaadan ke sadhano ke swami nahin the
 The source of their dominance was not economic, rather their power came from diverse sources
 yah alag baat he ki apane prabhutv kaa laabh uthaa kar abhijan bade paimaane par dhan-sampatti jamaa kar lete the
 Mosca and Pareto also said that the pattern of leadership of future societies is going to remain the same
 haalaanki in vidwaanon ne aagrahpurvak kaha ki unka samaaj-vigyaan kisi mulya se bandhaa hua nahin he, par italy main ubharate hue fasiwad ke prati unki hamadardi kisi se chhipi hui nahin thi
 Pareto and Michaels were straightforward supporters of fascism and viewed fascism as a compulsion due to their resentment from the liberal Mosca Left
 kul mila kar in teenon siddhantkaron kii koshish thi ki sansadeey vyavastha keval ucch or madhyavarg kii bhagidaari tak hi simit rahani chahie
 He used to look at the Parliament representing workers and peasants contemptuously
 marxvaadi siddhantkaron or loktantric bahultawad ke pairokaron ne is abhijanwaad ko kadi chunauti di
 Marxists said that this theory failed to identify the basic basis of the dominance of the elite
 abhijan chaahe faujee hon, dharmik hon, raajnneetik hon yaa saanskrithik; unke prabhutv kii buniyaad aarthik varg-sambandhon main dekhi jaani chahie
 Pluralists argued that in modern, developed and liberal societies there is competition between diverse interests for power and domination
 isliye mutthi bhar abhijanon kaa gut sarvangin prabhutv kabhi sthapit nahin kar paata
 The decision making process is not just one
 is hakeekat ke vipareet abhijanwaad ke pairokaar udaarataavaad ke aadhaar par khadey samaajon main satta or uske sroton kaa adhyayan karne ke liye trutipurna paddati apanaate hai
 Although the elitism doctrine was anti-democracy, Joseph Schumpeter incorporated the elitist doctrine into elitist democratic theory in the mid-twentieth century
 unhone kaha ki loktantr main bhi shashan abhijanon ke haath main hi rahanaa chahie taaki vyavastha ko prabhavi or sthir hukmran lagaataar milte rahen
 The only condition is that such elites are selected through democratic processes
 yah vaicharik ejineering karne ke peeche shumpiter kaa uddeshy udaarataavaadi loktantr ko fasiwad athwa communism kaa samarthan karne vaale vyavastha-virdohi abhijanon ke netritv main chalane vaale andolanon se bachaana tha
 Taking a pluralistic theory, Schumpeter said that the liberal claim of power and multidimensionality of decision is not correct
 darasal prabhutv ke liye aapas main hode karne vaale samoohon kaa niyantran kuch thode se netaaon ke haath main rahata he jo aavashyak nahin ki apane samooh ke sadasyon kii ichchhaaon or zaruuraton ke hisaab se hi chalate hon
 Hence the competition between groups becomes a competition between their leaders
 nattejey taur bahultavaadi loktantr abhijanvaadee loktantr main badal jaataa he
 The sustainability and development of this idea of democracy is the result of the activism and commitment of its relatives, not dependent on the passive civil society
 loktantric vyavastha ho yaa nirankushta, abhijanon ke mahatva se puri tarah se inkaar karnaa mushkil he
 Some scholars argue that the interpreters of liberal democracy pay more attention to decisions taken under the influence of the masses
 is tarah abhijanon dwaara lee gayi pahalakadamiyon kii bhoomika par puraa prakaash nahin pad paata
 Sociologists interested in elite studies try to find out the social and educational backgrounds of leaders from various walks of social life to find out what factors influence them in the elites
 agar samaaj ke kisi hisse main ek se zyaada abhijan samooh sakriy hai to yah pataa lagaaya jaataa he ki unke bich kis tarah kaa saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik or vichaardhaaratmak antarsambandh he; or unamem ekikrut hone kii sambhaavnaayen hai yaa nahin
 a second dimension of elite study is the study of relationships between the elite and the public
 isamen yah jaanane kii koshish kii jaati he ki upar se neeche or neeche se upar is tarah ke sambandh kaa sanchaar kis tarah hota he
 The drawbacks of this relationship determine the status of the forces that wish to replace the elite
 is vishleshan se hi tay hota he ki kisi vishisht abhijan ko hataane ke liye shantipurna yaa krantikari tareekon ke peeche kya kaaran kaam kar rahe the
 C
 Wright Mills, who studies American elite, has formulated the concept of 'power Elite'
 mills ke anusaar sanyukt rajya america main teen tarah ke abhijan ekikrut ho kar hukumat karte hai
 These are industrial, political military
 dilachasp baat yah he ki anya siddhantkaron ke vipareet mills yah dikhaate hai ki abhijanon kii is tikdi se mil kar banane vaala power ilit loktantr ke liye kis tarah se nuksaandeh he
 The elite theory has also interfered in the field of culture-studies
 maas socity ke ubhaar kii aalochana karne vaale yah maan kar chalate hai ki samakaleen maas media or usase nikalne vaali lokapriy jan-samskruti abhijan samskruti kii shreshthata ke liye ghaatak hoti he
 Elite classes can be of many types, for example - aksar kisi ek prakaar ke sambhraant varg kaa sadsy anya kshetron ke sambhraant virgon kaa sadsy bhi hota he
 For example, it has been observed that in many societies, the best education, the most wealth and the greatest political power are found in the people of the same class

 Bundelkhand is a very wide state in view of history, culture and language
 lekin isaki bhugolic, saanskrithik or bhashik ikaayiyon main adbhut samanta he
 Geographers are of the opinion that the boundaries of Bundelkhand are clear and certain in physical and cultural form that it is a geographical region of India in which not only the basis of structural unity, geography and sociality is also the same
 vastav main samast bundelkhand main sachhee saamaajik, aarthik or bhaavnaatmak ekta he
 Based on Puranas, the famous geographer SM Ali has equated the three districts of Vindhyas, Vidisha, Darshana and Karusha with son-can
 isi prakaar tripuri lagbhag upree narmada kii ghati tathaa jabalpur, mandla tathaa narsinghpur jilon ke kuch bhaagon kaa pradesh mana he
 Historian Jayachandra Vidyalankar has tried to combine Bundelkhand into a few lines, balancing historical and geographical terms, the third block of Vindhyamekhala is Bundelkhand comprising Betwa, Dhasa and Kain's kanthas, the upper valley of the Narmada and the Aksh mountain from Pachmarhi to Amarkantak
 Part is included
 uski poorabi seemaa tones nadi he
 Based on the current physical researches, Bundelkhand has been declared as a physical region and its boundaries are based on - the region which is Yamuna in the north, Vindhya Paleto ranges in the south, Chambal in the northwest and Panna in the south-east
 - Ajaygarh is surrounded by ranges, known as Bundelkhand
 isamen uttar pradesh ke jalon, jhaansi, lalitpur, chitrakoot hamirpur, baandaa or mahoba tathaa madhya-pradesh ke sagar, damoh, tikamgarh, chhatarpur, panna, datia ke alaava bhind jile kii lahaar or gwalior jile kii mander tahseelein tathaa raisen or vidisha jile kaa kuch bhaag bhi shaamil he
 However, these boundary lines can be said to be justified in terms of geostructure

 All its basis is mythological texts
 bundelkhand shabd madhyakaal se pehle is naam se prayog main nahin aayaa he
 Its diverse names and their use have been in the modern era itself
 beesvin shatee ke praarambhik dashak main rhibahadur maharajasingh ne bundelkhand kaa itihaas likhaa tha
 In this, the calculation of the names of the Jagirs and their rulers under Bundelkhand was the main one
 dewan pratipaal singh ne tathaa panna darbar ke prasiddh kavi krishna ne apane sroton se bundelkhand ke itihaas likhe parantu ve vidwaan bhi saamaajik saanskrithik chetnaaon ke prati udasin rahe
 According to Dr
 Gupt, Pandit Harihar Niwas Dwivedi has discussed in detail the political, religious, cultural achievements of Bundelkhand in the history book of Central India
 is granth main kuch sthanon par bundelkhand kaa itihaas bhi aayaa he
 Pandit Gorelal Tiwari made a good effort and wrote a brief history of Bundelkhand which was different from most texts till date but he wrote the history of Bundelkhand on sociological basis only on political events
 budelkhand ke pracheen itihaas ke sambandh main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn dharna yah he ki yah chedi janapad kaa hissaa tha
 Some scholars consider Chedi district to be ancient Bundelkhand
 puranic kaal main bundelkhand prasiddh shaskaon ke adheen rahaa he jinamein chandravanshi raajaaon ke shrunkhalabaddh shasankaal kaa ullekh sabase adhik he
 In the Buddhist period, a Buddhist named Shampak built a stupa with the nails and hair of Lord Buddha in Baghuda region
 marhoot main iske avshesh vidyaman hai
 With regard to Buddhist history, the remains of that time in Bundelkhand are clear that there was no significant change in the condition of Bundelkhand during this period
 chedi kii charchaa na hona or vatsa, avanti ke shaskaon kaa mahatv darshaya janaa is baat kaa pramaan he ki chedi inamen se kisi ek ke adheen rahaa hoga
 The ancient district of Chedi is thus Bundelkhand
 itihaas sakshi he ki bharat kii aazaadee ke pratham sangram kii jwaala meerut kii chhavnee main bhadki thi
 But there is a truth missing behind these historical facts, that 15 years before the war of independence, Meerut started a revolution in Dharmanagri Chitrakoot of Bundelkhand
 pavitra mandakini ke kinare gokshi ke khilaaf ekajute hui hindu-muslim birdari ne mau tehsil main adaalat lagaakar paanch firangi afasaron ko faansee par lataka diya
 After this, whenever the British or any of their hangers tried to cheat in the pride of the Bundelas, they were beheaded
 is kranti ke nayak the aazaadee ke pratham sangram kii jwaala meerut ke sidhe-saadhe harbole
 The 'ghaghra platoon' of Burkhanshini women was also instrumental in taking forward the tales of struggle
 aazaadee ke sangharsh kii pehali mashaal sulgaane vaale bundelkhand ke ranbankure itihaas ke pannon main jagah nahin paa sake, lekin unki shoorveerta kii tasdik firangi afasar khud kar gayi hai
 There is a story buried in the Banda Gazette written by the British authorities, which is known by very few people
 gajetir ke panne palatney par maaloom hua ki varsh 1857 main meerut kii chhavnee main firangiyon kii fouj ke sipaahi mangal pandeya ke vidroh se bhi 15 saal pehle chitrakoot main kranti kii chingaari bhadak chuki thi
 Actually, British officers used to slaughter cows on the banks of the holy Mandakini river in Dharmanagari at that time of the past
 gaumance ko bihar or bengal main bhejkar vahaan se evaj main rasad or hathiyaar mangaye jate the
 The local people were distracted by the killing of a second faith, ie the cow dynasty, on the banks of Mandakini, a symbol of faith, but the tongue was closed due to the fear of the Firangi
 kuch logon ne himmat dikhaate hue maratha shaskaon or mandakini paar ke ‘nayaa gaanv’ ke choube raajaaon se fariyaad lagaayi, lekin donon shaskaon ne angrejon kii mukhaalafat karne se inkaar kar diya
 The request went in vain, as a result a flame of vengeance flared inside the chest
 isi dauraan gaanv-gaanv ghoomane vaale harbolon ne gaukashi ke khilaaf logon ko jaagrit karte hue ekajute karnaa shuru kiya
 Then on the sixth day of June in the year 1842, he did not expect any
 hajaaron kii sankhya main nihathe mazdooron, naujavaanon or burkanashin mahilaon ne mau tehsil ko gherkar firangiyon ke saamne baghawat ke naare buland kiye
 The special thing was that hindu-muslim fraternity had equal participation in this movement against Gaukashi
 tehsil main goron ke khilaaf aawaaj buland hui to bundelon kii bhujaaen fadakane lageen
 After seeing the British officers were hostage, after this, a 'public court' was put under the tree and five British officers were hanged after trial
 janakranti kii yah jwaala mau main dafan hone ke bajaay rajapur bazaar pahunchi or angrej afasar khaded diye gayi
 Seeing the beauty of time, the landlords of Merca and Samagra also jumped into the movement
 do din baad 8 june ko baberu bazaar sulagaa to vahaan ke thanedaar or tehseeldaar ko jaan bachaakar bhaagna padaa
 Along with expelling the British from Joharpur, Palani, Bisalpur, Semri, the revolutionaries in the office of Tindwari Tehsil burnt government records and looted three thousand rupees
 aazaadee kii jwaala bhadakne par gori hukumat ne apane pitthu shaskaon ko hukum jari karte hue krantikariyon ko kuchalane ke liye kaha
 On this decree, Panna Naresh sent a thousand soldiers, a cannon, four elephants and fifty bulls, the queen of Chhatarpur and the king of Gaurihar as well as the army of the king of Ajaygarh had also traveled to Chitrakoot
 duusari ore banda chhavnee main dubake firangi afasaron ne banda nawab se jaan kii guhaar lagaate hue bivi-bacchon ke saath pahunch gayi
 Here to suppress the rebellion, all the soldiers of the army of Indian kings who reached banda-chitrakoot started to step in with the agitators
 nattejey main utsaahi krantikariyon ne 15 june ko banda chhavnee ke prabharee mi
 kakrel ko pakadaney ke baad gardan ko dhad se alag kar diya
 After this, to end the awe of the British from inside Awam, roam the streets of Banda with a severed head
 kakrel kii hatya ke do din baad rajapur, mau, banda, darsenda, tarauhaan, badausa, baberu, pailaani, simauni, sihunda ke bundelon ne yuddh parishad kaa gathan karte hue bundelkhand ko aaazaad ghoshit kar diya
 Convener of "bundelkhand Unified Party" Sanjay Pandey says that when the British officers themselves have written about this revolution, then why did Indian historians not give these facts a place in the pages of history? When asked the truth it was a real mass movement Because there was no leader in it but the general public was the agitator, so it is not possible to ignore the struggle of the Bundelas to find a place in history

 kaha ki bundelkhand ekikrut party prachaar prasar ke madhyam se bundelon kii yah veerta purna kahani sari duniya tak pahuchaayegi According to the known history of Bundelkhand, evidence of Mauryan reign is available here 300 BC

 This kernel has many low branches - branches

 Bundelkhand is rich in iron, gold, silver, glass, diamond, emerald etc
 iske alaava yahan chuunaa kaa pathar bhi prachur maatra main paaya jaataa he
 The names of the rocks found on the Vindhaya mountain are famous with the names of the places around it such as - Limestone of Mandar, Chip of Gannaur Garh, Lima of Rewa and Panna, Chip of Vijaygarh etc

 Today we get a glimpse of the past splendor of Bundelkhand from the Paleolithic period scattered over the said land
 is bhoomi par is kala ne kitna aadar paaya or uskaa kitna vikaas hua, yah baat puraatatv-visheshgyon se chhipi nahin he
 The remains of the idols, which are worshiped by the tribal people of the prehistoric period, are obtained from the Bundelkhand land itself
 kala kii drushti se inkaa mulya adhik nahin he, kintu murtikla ke vibhinn rup kaa acha strot he
 These sculptures matter a lot and are priceless
 bharat ek bahut bada desh he
 There is a huge difference between the costumes and the language of every state
 itani badi bhinnata hote hue bhi ek samanta he jo desh ko ek sutara main piroye hue he
 That is the cultural unity and festivals here

 The festivals fulfill the enthusiasm, joy and enthusiasm in our life

 They have mythological and spiritual significance and are part of our cultural heritage

 In the time of Chhatrasal, where Bundelkhand is known as "its Jamuna Ut Narmada, Its Chambal Ut Tons"
 vahaan bhugolic drushti janajivan, samskruti or bhashaa ke sandarbh se bundela kshatriyon ke vaibhavkaal se joda jaataa he
 Bundeli is the most practiced dialect of this terrain

 There is also an introduction to various practices, castes and etc
 of Bundeli poetry

 a total of seven eras of Bundelkhand poetry can be considered on the basis of different trends and movements, which have been designated with the following names for the convenience of study
 bundelkhand ekikrut party dwaara prastaavit bundelkhand rajya main kuch jile uttar pradesh ke tathaa kuch madhya pradesh ke hai, vartmaan main bundelkhand kshetra kii stithi bahut hi gambhir he

 panini sanskrit bhashaa ke sabase bade vaiyaakaran hue hai
 He was born in Gandhara, then northwest India
 inke vyakaran kaa naam ashtaadhi he jisamen aath adhyay or lagbhag chaar sahasr sutara hai
 Panini's contribution in giving grammatical form to the Sanskrit language is considered incomparable
 ashtaadhi maatr vyakaran granth nahin he
 In this way, a complete picture of the then Indian society is found
 us samay ke bhugol, saamaajik, aarthik, shiksha or raajnneetik jivan, darshanik chintan, khan-paan, rahan-sahan aadi ke prasang sthaan-sthaan par ankit hai
 Panini was born in a village called Shalatur
 jahaan kabul nadi sindhu main mili he us sangam se kuch mile dur yah gaanv tha
 He is now called Lahur
 apane janmasthan ke anusaar panini shalaaturiya bhi kahe gaye hai
 And he himself mentions this name in the Ashtadhyayi
 chini yatri yuvanchvaan uttar-pashchim se aate samay shalaatur gaanv main gaye the
 Panini's guru's name was the father's name Panin and mother's name was Daakshi
 panini jab bade hue to unhone vyakaranshastra kaa gaharaa adhyayan kiya
 There were many masters of vocabulary before Panini
 unke granthon ko padhakar or unke paraspar bhedon ko dekhakar panini ke man main vah vichaar aayaa ki unhen vyakaranshastra ko vyavasthit karnaa chahie
 Earlier, before Panini, the Vedic codes, branches, Brahmins, Aranyakas, Upanishads, etc
, which had expanded, they took the word for themselves from the word which they have used in the Ashtadhyayi
 duusare nirukt or vyakaran kii jo saamagree pehle se thi uskaa unhone sangrah or sookshm adhyayan kiya
 The proof of this is also in the Ashtadhyayi, as is known by the mention of the opinions of Acharyas like Shaktaayan, Shakalya, Bharadwaja, Gargya, Senak, Apishli, Galab and Sphotayan
 shakatayan nishchit rup se panini se purv ke vaiyaakaran the, jaisaa niruktkaar yask ne likhaa he
 Shaktayan opined that all noun words are formed from metals
 panini ne is mat ko sweekaar kiya kintu is vishay main koi aagrah nahin rakhaa or yah bhi kaha ki bahut se shabd aise bhi hai jo lok kii bolchaal main aa gaye hai or unase dhaatu pratyay kii pakad nahin kii ja sakati
 The third most important thing Panini did was that he saw the world with his own eyes and wandered and got the introduction of the multifaceted life of people and manipulated the words
 is prakaar se kitne hi sahasr shabdon ko unhone ikattha kiya
 By compiling the words, he classified them and made several lists of them
 ek suchi "dhaatu paath" kii thi jise panini ne ashtaadhi se alag rakhaa he
 It contains 1943 metals
 dhatupath main do prakaar kii dhaatuen hai- 1
 jo panini se pehle sahitya main prayukt ho chuki thim or duusari ve jo logon kii bolchaal main unhen mili
 His second list had many Acharyas of Vedas
 kis acharya ke naam se koun sa charan prasiddh hua or usamen padhanevaale chaatr kis naam se prasiddh the or un chand yaa shakhaon ke kya naam the, un sab kii nishpatti bhinn bhinn pratyay lagaakar panini ne di he; jaise ek acharya tittiri the
 His stage was called Taittariya and the students of that school and the branch or samhita there were also called Taittiriya
 panini kii teesri suchi "gotron" ke sambandh main thi
 The original seven gotras used to go from the Vedic era itself
 panini ke kaal tak aate aate unka bahut vistaar ho gaya tha
 Many lists of gotras are in the Srauta Sutras
 jaise bodhayan shrout sutara main jise mahapravar cond kehete hai
 But Panini made a very large list of names of family or family of both Vedic and cosmic languages, which included both the Arasha gotra and the cosmic gotra
 chote mote paariwarik naam yaa allon ko unhone gotravyav kaha hai
 Panini has given a detailed description of how the names of grandfather, old and uncle etc
 in a gotra or family were kept
 bisiyon sutron ke saath lage hue ganon main gotron ke anek naam panini ke "ganpaath" naamak parishisht granth main hai
 The fourth list of Panini was geographical
 panini kaa janmasthan uttar pashchim main tha, jis pradesh ko ham gandhar kehete hai
 Greek geography writers have written that there were about 500 such villages in the northwest ie Gandhara and Punjab, each of which had a population of about ten millennia
 panini ne un 500 graamon ke vaastavik naam bhi de die hai jinase unke bhugol sambandhi ganon kii suchiyaan bani hai
 The identification of those names of villages and towns is a sincerity question, but if a lot of hard work is done, it is possible that Sunet and Sirsa are two small villages in Punjab called Panini as Sunetra and Sharikshak
 punjab kii anek jatiyon ke naam un gaanvon ke anusaar the jahaan vah jati nivas karti thi yaa jahaan se uske purvaj aae the
 In this way, the surnames that were made from both the residence and the elite were added to the male name because such names were also part of the language
 panini ne punjab ke madhyabhaag main khadey hokar apni drushti purv or pashchim kii ore daudai
 He saw two mountainous areas
 purv kii ore kullu kongdaan jise us samay trigart kehete the, pashchimi ore kaa pahari pradesh vah tha jo gandhar kii purvi rajdhani takshashila se pashchimi rajdhani pushkalavati tak failaa tha
 In this, it was the region now known as the tribal region and was spread from north to south of the Indus River and at the northern end was Dard and at the southern end was Saubir
 panini ne is pradesh main rahanevaale kabeelon kii vistrut suchi banaai or samvidhanon kaa adhyayan kiya
 This region was called the rural area at that time because in these tribes, as it is today and still at that time, Gramani was the practice of governance and the word Gramani was the title of their leader or ruler
 in jatiyon kii shashansabha ko is samay jirga kehete hai or panini ke yug main use "bratapug", "sangh" yaa "gana" kehete the
 In fact, there was not a single type of rule of all tribes, but they were in different stages of development of union rule
 panini ne vraat or pug in sangyaaon se bataaya he ki inamen se bahut se kabeeley utsedhajivi yaa lutpaat karke jivan bitaate the jo aaj bhi vahaan ke jivan kii sachai he
 At that time all these tribes or castes were Hindus and the names of their overlords were in Sanskrit language such as Devadattak, the ancestor of the clan or the founder was some Devadatta
 ab naam badal gaye hai, kintu baat vahi he jaise isakhel kabeeley kaa purvaj isa naamak koi vyakti tha
 Many of the names of these tribes are found in Panini's Ganpath, such as Afridi and Mohammed whom Panini has called Apriet and Madhumant
 panini kii bhugolic soochiyon main ek suchi janapadon kii he
 In ancient times, our country was sitting in the district lands
 madhya asia kii vankshu nadi ke uparibhaag main sthit kamboj janapad, pashchim main saurashtra kaa kuccha janapad, purab main assam pradesh kaa surmas janapad or dakshin main godavari ke kinare ashmak janapad in chaar khunton ke bich main sara bhubhag janapadon main banta hua tha or logon ke raajnneetik or saamaajik jivan evam bhashaaon kaa janapadiya vikaas sahasron varshon se chalaa aata tha
 Panini explains the etymology of Sahasrona words in the fourth fifth chapters of Ashtadhyagi
 brahman, kshatriya, sainik, vyapaaree kisaan, rangrej, badhai, rasoie, mochi, gwaale, charvaahe, gadriye, bunakar, kumhaar aadi saikadon peshewar logon se miljulkar panini ne unke vishesh peshey ke shabdon kaa sangrah kiya
 Panini explained which word suffixes
 varnmaala ke swar or vyanjan rup jo akshar he unheen se pratyay banaae gaye
 Just like annual from rain, the root word here is rain and a suffix is added to it and it means yearly
 ashtaadhi main tadwiton kaa prakaran rochak he
 Somewhere one is surprised at the subtle scrutiny of Panini, for example, that in the Bangar land on the northern bank of the Vyas river, the names of the paved Baramasi wells were pronounced in a different tone and every year in the Khadar land on the western side of the same The raw wells that were dug had a slightly different tone of names
 yah baat panini ne "udak c bipasha" sutara main kahi he
 Panini has given the life story of cows and bulls in the formulas
 aarthik jivan kaa adhyayan karte hue panini ne un sikkon ko bhi jaanchaa jo bazaaron main chalate the
 Such as "shataman", "karshapana", "suvarna", "andha", "paad", "mashaka" "trinshatk", "winshatik"
 kuch log ablaa badali se bhi maal bechate the
 He was called "niman"
 panini ke kaal main shiksha or vaanmay kaa bahut vistaar tha
 He had studied Sanskrit very deeply
 vaidic or loukik donon bhashaaon se ve purnataya parichit the
 With his material, Panini composed his grammar, but kept the predominance of secular Sanskrit
 bolchaal kii loukik sanskrit ko unhone bhashaa kaha he
 He not only did scripture but also did teaching work
 
 Panini's educational relationship is possible from the University of Taxila
 kaha jaataa he, jab ve apni saamagree kaa sangrah kar chuke to unhone kuch samay tak ekantavaas kiya or ashtaadhi kii rachana kii
 There are many opinions about what was the time of Panini
 koi unhen 7veen shatee i
 pus
, koi 5veen shatee yaa chauthi shatee i
 pus
 kaa kehete hai
 Patanjali has written that Panini's Ashtadhyayi was not related to any one Veda but to the councils of all Vedas
 panini ke granthon kii sarvasammat pratishtha kaa yah bhi kaaran hua
 Panini was not partial to any particular opinion
 shabd kaa arth ek vyakti he yaa jati, is vishay main unhone donon pakshon ko mana he
 The word cow is also a sign of cow and also of cow
 vaajapyayan or vyadi naamak do aacharyon main bhinn maton kaa aagrah yaa, par panini ne saralata se donon ko sweekaar kar liya
 a famous grammar before Panini was that of Indra
 usamen shabdon kaa praathikanthik yaa pratipadik vichaar kiya gaya tha
 The same tradition was taken in the grammar of Bharadwaj Acharya before Panini
 panini ne usapar vichaar kiya
 He took many technical nouns from him, such as pronouns, avyayas, and made many new ones, like ti, ghu, bhi etc
 panini ko mangalik acharya kaha gaya he
 The generous instinct of his heart was to aspire to manly deeds and fruits
 isaki sakshi yah he ki unhone apane shabdanushasan kaa aarambh "vruddh" shabd se kiya
 Some scholars say that Panini's treatise contains not only the primitive but also the middle and antimal
 unka antim sutara a aa he
 Harsvaraka is the origin of varna symposium
 panini ko suhridbhoot acharya arthath sabake mitra evam pramanbhoot acharya bhi kaha he
 Pantjali says that the formula which Panini once wrote did not cut it
 vyakaran main unke prayek akshar kaa pramaan mana jaataa he
 The words disciple, guru, folk and Vedas Dhatuli and the native word which the Acharya saw, watered him with juice
 aaj bhi panini "shabd:loke prakashte", arthath unka naam sarvatra prakashit he
 Ur inkaa samaykaal anishchit tathaa vivaadit he
 It is certain that they must have existed after the sixth century BC and before the fourth century BC
 aisa mana jaataa he ki inkaa janm punjab ke shalaatula main hua tha jo aadhunik peshawar ke kareeb he
 Their lifespan is believed to be 520–460 BC
 panini ke jeevankaal ko maapne ke liye yavanani shabd ke uddhran kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 It is interpreted by the Greek woman or the Greek script
 gandhar main yawano ke bare main pratyaksh jaankaree sikandar ke akraman ke pehle nahin thi
 Alexander came to India around 330 BC
 par aisa ho saktaa he ki panini ko farsi yon ke jariye yawanon kii jaankaree hogi or panini daara pratham ke kaal main bhi ho sakate hai
 According to Plutarch, when Alexander came to India, there were already some Greek settlements here
 aisa mana jaataa he ki panini ne likhane ke liye kisi na kisi madhyam kaa prayog kiya hoga kyonki unke dwaara prayukt shabd ati clisht the tathaa bina likhe unka vishleshan sambhav nahin lagata he
 Many say that he used the memory of his disciples as his writing book
 bharat main lipi kaa pun: prayog 6thi sadi isa purv main hua or brahmi lipi kaa pratham prayog dakshin bharat ke tamilnadu main hua jo uttar pashchim bharat ke gandhar se dur tha
 Gandhara had Persian rule in the 6th century BC and it is possible that they may have used the Armaic characters
 panini kaa sanskrit vyakaran chaar bhaagon main he - Patanjali wrote his commentary on the Ashtadhyayi of Panini named Mahabhashya)
 ek shatabdi se bhi pehle prasiddh german bharatvid maiks mular ne apane science of that main kaha - "I can boldly say that in English or Latin or Greek such concepts are negligible which cannot be expressed by words derived from Sanskrit metals
 iske vipareet meraa vishwaas he ki 2,50,000 shabd sammilit maane jane vaale angrezi shabdkosh kii sampoorn smapda ke spashtikaran hetu vaanchit dhaatuon kii sankhya, uchit simaaon main nunikrut panineey dhaatuon se bhi kam he
 xxrep 4 
 There is no such sentence in English, after careful analysis of the contents of each word from 800 metals and each idea provided by Panini, the 121 fundamental concepts cannot be extracted
 " The style of Panini's sutras is very brief
 ve sutarayug main hi hue the
 The Shrouta Sutra, Dharma Sutra, Grihasthasutra, Pritishakhya Sutra are also in the same style but the flourishing in the Panini Sutras is not elsewhere
 isiliye panini ke sutron ko pratishna sutara kaha gaya he
 Panini divided the varna or alphabet into 14 pratyahara sutras and made 42 pratyahara sutras by ordering them in special order
 panini kii sabase badi visheshta yahi he jisase ve thode sthaan main adhik saamagree bhar sake
 If the letters of Ashtadhyayi are counted, then its 3995 sutras are equal to one thousand verses
 panini ne sankshipt granthrachana kii or bhi kai yuktiyaan nikaalin jaise adhikaar or anuvritti arthath sutara ke ek yaa kai shabdon ko aage ke sutron main le janaa jisase unhen doharaana na pade
 He also made some definitions of meaning
 ek badi vicitra yukti unhone asiddh sutron kii nikaali
 That is, the latter formula disappears the work of the formula before it
 panini kaa yah asiddh niyam unki aisi tantra yukti thi jo sansar ke anya kisi granth main nahin pai jaati

 mecromedia graphics or web vikaas karne vaala ek america software house tha jiskaa mukhyalay san francisco, california, main sthit tha or jisane flashaur drimavivar jaise utpaadon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Its competitor, Adobe Systems, acquired Macromedia on 3 December 2005 and as of 2010 controls Macromedia's range of products
 1992 main hue othraware ink or mechromind-paracomp ke vilay se mecromidia kii utpatti hui
 Director was an interactive multimedia-authoring tool widely used in the creation of CD roms and information repositories and served as Macromedia's flagship product until the mid-1990s
 jaise-jaise CD-ROM ke bazaar main giravat aane lagi or world wide web kii lokapriyata badhane lagi, mecromedia ne shockwave banaaya, jo web brouzar ke liye ek diarector-vyler plagain tha, lekin usne yah faisla kiya ki use apni shakhaon ko web netive media upkaran main failaa kar apane bazaar kaa vistaaran karne kii jarurat he
 In January 1995, Macromedia acquired Altsys for its intellectual property; In particular, Freehand, a page-layout and vector-drawing program very similar to Adobe Illustrator
 freehand kaa vector-graphics pradaan karne vaala ingine or program ke andar ke anya software ghatak, mecromedia ke liye uske web ranneeti kaa samarthan karne vaale praudyogikiyon ke vikaas main upyogi sabit hote
 In 1996, Macromedia made two acquisitions to begin its web strategy immediately
 sarvapratham, mecromedia ne futurevev software kaa adhigrahan kiya, jo futuresplash animator ke nirmaataa the, yah ek aisa anemeshan upkaran tha jise futurevev software ne mul rup se kalam-aadhaarit computing saadhan ke liye viksit kiya
 Because of the small size of the futuresplash Viewer application, it was particularly suitable for downloading via the web, where most users had, at the time, low-bandwidth connections
 mecromedia ne splash kaa naam badal kar mecromedia flash rakh diya or netscape kaa anukaran karte hue, tezi se bazaar par apni paith banane ke liye, flash player ko ek ni:shulk brouzar plagain ke rup main vitarit kiya
 As of 2005, computers around the world had more installed Java, Quick Time, Real Networks and Windows Media Player, Flash Player than any other web media format
 jaise-jaise flash paripakv hua, mecromedia kaa dhyaan use ek graphics or media upkaran ke rup main vipanit karne se hat kar use ek web anuprayog plateform ke rup main badhaava dene par kendrit ho gaya, is player ke chote padchihn ko banaae rakhane kaa prayaas karte hue unhone isamen scrypting or data abhigam kshamtaaon ko joda
 Also in 1996, Macromedia acquired iband Software, a manufacturer of innovative backstage HTML authoring-tools and application-servers
 mecromedia ne backstage kodebes ke bhaagon ke ird-gird, mecromedia drimavivar naamak ek nae HTML sanlekhan upkaran kaa vikaas kiya or 1997 main uske pehle sanskaran ko jari kiya
 At that time, most professional web authors preferred to manually encode HTML using a text editor because they wanted complete control over the source
 drimavivar ne apane "roundtrip HTML" suvidha dwaara iskaa samaadhaan pesh kiya, jo drishy sampadan ke dauraan hast-sampadit strot kuta kii nishtha ko banaae rakhane kaa prayaas karata tha, jisase prayokta drishy or kuta sampadan ke bich aage or peeche jane main sakasham hote hai
 Over the next few years, Dreamweaver became widely adopted among professional web authorities, although many still preferred hand-code, and Microsoft frontpage remained a strong competitor among amateur and business users
 mecromedia ne vilay or adhigrahan kaa safar jari rakhaa: disambar 1999 main, usne trephic vishleshan software company andromedia corporation kaa adhigrahan kiya
 Web development company Alair was acquired in 2001 and Macromedia added a number of popular server and web development products to its portfolio, including coldfusion, a web unusable server based on the CMFL language, Jeron, a Java EE application server And homesite, an HTML code editor, was also reunited with Dreamweaver
 2003 main, mecromedia ne web conferencing company pressedia kaa adhigrahan kiya or unke brand brij ke tahat unke flash aadhaarit online sahyog or prastuti utpaada kii peshkash ko viksit karnaa or badhaava dena jari rakhaa
 Later that same year, Macromedia acquired the subsidiary authoring software company ehelp Corporation, these products included Robohelp and robodemo
 robohelp ke kai vikasakarta madacap software ko banane main jute gaye jo help-othuring spes main ek pratiyogi tha
 On April 18, 2005, Adobe Systems announced the acquisition of Macromedia in a $ 3
4 price share swap, which was performed on the last day of trading prior to the announcement
 3 disambar 2005 ko, adhigrahan sampann hua or uske turant baad adobi ne companiyon ke parichaalan, network or graahak seva sanghathanon ko ekikrut kar diya

" airlift internet movie database par Structural engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with the analysis and design of structures to be built to withstand load or resist force
 ise praayah civil ejiniyari ke andar ek visheshgyata kaa kshetra samajha jaataa he
 The job of a structure engineer is often to design buildings and large non-building structures, but they can also be associated with the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles, etc
 sanrachana ejiniyari kaa siddhanth bhautik niyamon tathaa vibhinn padaarthon / jyamitiyon ke gundharm se sambandhit anubhavjanya gyaan par aadhaarit he
 Complex structures are created by the addition of many small structural components
 sanrachana ejeeniyar ko lohe or ispaat kaa hi nahin, balki lakdi, eent, pathar, chuunaa or cement kaa bhi aadhuniktam gyaan tathaa yantric evam vidyut ejiniyari ke kaamon main bhi daksh hona chahie, kyonki inhen apane dhaanche yantriki tathaa bhautikee ke siddhanton ke anusaar niraapad dhang se banane padate hai
 Full knowledge of the nature of land, water and air should be the same as that of a civil engineer
 sanrachana ejiniyari 19veen shatabdi tak civil ejiniyari kaa ek vibhaag samajha jaataa tha, parantu jaise-jaise sabhy samaaj kii aavashyaktaayen paristhitiyon ke anusaar badalati or badhati gai, unnat prakaar ke lohe, ispaat aadi kaa utpaadan tathaa prayog badhane laga, vaise-vaise yantra-vigyaan kii unnati hui
 Knowledge of the physical properties of various metals increased, so steel was used more and more in the construction of factories and houses

 Today, building twenty-two storey houses in big cities has become a minor thing
 sanrachana ejiniyari ke sahare hi aisa ho sakaa he
 There is also great help from structure engineers in manufacturing
 scotland kii forth nadi ke prasiddh pul main, jo cantelivernuma bana he, nadi ke bich main teen khambhon ke aadhaar par do mehrav to puure bane hai, jinke prayek khambhe kaa paat 1,710 foot he or samast pul kaa paat, tat se tat tak, 5215 foot he
 America's Quebec Bridge is considered the largest of the cantilever bridges around the world
 iske kendriya mehrab kaa paat 1,800 foot he
 The construction of this bridge was finished in 1918 AD, it was started for traffic
 yah pul aadhunik sanrachana kala kaa sarvshereshth namoona he
 The bridge called Hellgate of New York has only one arch
 iske paat kaa vistaar 1,017 foot he
 Among the bridges in India, the Howrah bridge in Calcutta and the Lakshman Jhula in Rishikesh near Haridwar are good examples of this art
 prayek imaarat kii banaavat main chat or farsh ke liye dharanon, kainchiyon, khambhon tathaa jameen par bani buniyaad kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Their combination is the 'structure' of the house
 dhaanche chaahe kisi imaarat, pul athwa kraine aadi yantron ke liye hon, unki rachana karte samay yah vichaar karnaa aavashyak he ki unke vividh avyavon par kis kis prakaar ke tathaa kis pariman main bahari bal bhaar ke rup main padenge
 According to the theory of statics, due to those forces, the stresses on the various components of the structure also have to be calculated very carefully, so that the structure becomes strong and secure in all respects
 dhaanche ko drudh banane kaa arth uske avyavon ko khub motaa tathaa baari bana dena nahin hota
 The structure of the structure should have the ability to bear the force
 aisa dhaanchaa anke tribhujon ko milakar banaaya jaataa he
 Structures made of quadrilaterals and panchmen do not have this much capability
 trikonyukt dhaanche ko kanchi kehete hai
 It is completely innocent from the point of view of the forces to be tolerated and is self-fulfilling from the point of view of the elements
 aisi kainchiyan kaaphi lambey paaton ke liye banaai ja sakati hai tathaa bhaar padane par swayan santulit bhi rah sakati hai
 Why not work by placing simple concrete type long girder on the walls to make big roof roofs? Why triangular scissors are made? The roofs of moderately small roofs can be made by placing a plain girder of the proper size, but the girder is very heavy and expensive if it is too long
 bade paaton ke liye trikonyukt kainchiyan kaaphi majboot hone ke saath hi bahut halaki or sasti padati hai
 The joints of the scissors are made firm by the ribs not by making pins
 ribaton main kuch vishesh prakaar ke bal adhik aane lagate hai jinhen sahane ke liye in ribaton ko adhik majboot avashya hi banaaya jaataa he
 The weight of the entire roof drop is divided through the lights, coming to the upper joints of the triangles, dividing them evenly on all the scissors, and dividing them half-by-half with the weight of these scissors, finally falling to the base
 at: in bojhon kaa anumaan badi saavdhaanee se kar lenaa hota he
 These burdens always remain the same because they are called immovable loads
 sabhi urdhwadhar deevaaron tathaa dhaalu chhaton par bagal se chalanevaali hawa ke kaaran jo urdhwadhar daab padati he, vah vaayu daab kehalaati he or yah chal bhaar kii ginati main aati he
 The interiors of many storied houses carry the weight of the residents and lift furniture but it is negligible compared to other fixed loads
 dhaanchon ke vibhinn avyavon par padanevaale balon kaa pariklan bal tribhuj athwa bal bahubhujon ke siddhant ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 Engineers use the "bau signal" system for this
 yah reeti apekshaya saral he
 The forces can also be calculated by pure mathematics with the help of statics and trigonometry
 is prakaar se gananaa karne ke liye, kisi upyukt bindu ko dhurnakendre maanate hue, dhaanche ke kisi avyav main padanevaale agyaat bal ke ghurna se samikrut kar dete hai
 The more the number of small triangles are made in it, the greater the scissors of the roof of the roof or the girder of the bridge are anatomized
 yadi kisi lambey khambhe par bhaar daalaa jaae, to ek seemaa se aage chalakar vah khambha bich main se jhukne lagata he
 The same thing is made of small size triangles of appropriate size to withstand force
 yadi kisi lambey khambhe par bhaar daalaa jaae, to ek seemaa se aage chalakar vah khambha bich main se jhukne lagata he
 The same applies to the pauses of scissors
 at: kainchiyon ko bal sahan karne yogya uchit aakaar ke chote chote trikonon main vibhajit kar banaate hai
 The burden that is placed on the structure is called weight
 chal or achal bhaar kaa ullekh upar hua he
 If the weight is concentrated at some place, it is called the concentrated weight and if it is spread over the entire component, it is called divided weight
 railgadee, motor, trek aadi chalane vaale vaahanon ke bhaar ko charbhaar or ek baar ek disha main or turant baad duusari disha se aanevaale bhaar ko prayavarti bhaar or dhamaake ke saath aanevaale bhaar ko sanghaat bhaar kehete hai
 Materials also have a stress
 bhaar kii paristhiti ore pravriti ke kaaran tanan, sampeden, aparupan, anthan aadi pratibal ho saktaa he
 The change that results from the effect of stress is called distortion
 padaarthon main pratyasthata kaa gun hota he, kisi main kam or kisi main kam or kisi main adhik
 There is a limit of elasticity
 seemaa se adhik bal padane par padaarth tut jate hai
 Hooke established a rule in 1676 that if a force was applied to each substance within its range of elasticity, there would be a special ratio between the stress caused by it and the deformation that occurred in that substance
 san 1826 main doctor yang ne pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar padanevaale pratibalon ke kaaran vibhinn padaarthon main honevaali vikrutiyon ke anupaaton kaa nishchayatmak rup se pataa lagaaya
 This is called Young's elasticity modulus
 tanan evam sampeden sambandhi anupaaton ko E, aparupan sambandhi anupaaton ko C, yaa g akshar or aaytan sambandhi anupaaton ko k akshar dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he: Direct elasticity modulus anuprastha pratyasthata mapank The volume of substances is reduced by compression
 at: aaytani pratyasthata mapank Changes in elasticity parameters lead to aplomb and mechanization
 yadi kisi thos chad ko khinchaa jaae, to ham dekhte hai ki vah bich main se patali padakar tut jaati he or yadi pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar bal lagaakar khinchaa jaae to uski lambaai badhane ke saath hi sab jagahon se uski parshvik naap choti ho jaati he
 Similarly, if a rod is pressed, its lateral measurement increases
 at: khinchaav athwa dabaav ke kaaran kisi pratyaksh thos kii parshvik naapon main jo parivartan hota he, vah pason ke anupaat ke anusaar hota he
 Express it with the letter M
 vishuddh aparupak pratibal, do saamaan tathaa ek duusare kii virdohi disha main kaam karanevaale pratibalon ke mishran ke rup main hota he
 Their action lines are also at right angles to each other
 yadi dhure kaa ek chor diwaar main dridhtaa se ksaa hua he or uske duusare chor par anthan bal lagaaya jaataa he, to doosraa chor kuch mud jayega
 The angle, which he turns by making the angle from the radish line, will be his convulsive angle
 is kone kii sahaayta se dhure kaa anthan bal nikaala ja saktaa he
 Testing of materials used in engineering is essential
 jis paristhiti main samagriyon kaa upyog hota he usee paristhiti main unako rakhkar, unka pareekshan karnaa chahie
 The test takes place in two ways: one has knowledge of the molecular organization of materials and is seen physically by pulling, pressing, shearing, punching, bending and turning to see how they are able to bear
 bhautik reeti se samagriyon kaa pareekshan karne ke liye aajkal ek yantra bana he jise hounfield tensometer kehete hai
 Its methodology is very simple and even a normal person can use it with a little training
 isse samagriyon kii samathrya, bhaar vikruti, abhishranti ityadi kaa gyaan saralata se ho jaataa he
 Deformation is very subtle or temporary as long as the stress on a substance remains within the range of elasticity of that substance
 bhaar hatate hi vah padaarth apni mul avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 But if the stress is above the threshold of elasticity, then the deformation is substantial and more permanent
 vibhanjak bhaar pratyasthata kii seemaa se kaaphi adhik hota he, par vyapaarik or upyogita kii drushti se yah bhaar kam hi rakhaa jaataa he or ise paraabhav bindu kehete hai tathaa ise hi vibhanjak bhaar maan liya jaataa he
 The limit of elasticity is planned at the time of design, weighting of much less than the bearable load
 at: yah vyaavhaarik bhaar atyadhik sahane yogya bhaar se jis anupaat main kam ho, us anupaat ko us padaarth kaa abhaya gunank yaa abhayank kehete hai
 It is expressed by the following formula: bhinn bhinn padaarthon ke abhayank vibhinn avasthaaon main vibhinn hote hai
 Hard steel is characterized by three in static load and five to eight in movable load and nine to 13 in alternating moving load
 padaarthon kii kathorta se unke tanaav, sampeden, avarupan aadi balon kaa anumaan saralata se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Modern methods of hardness testing are based on the principles of static dentistry and dynamic dentistry
 sthitik danturata siddhant par aadhaarit hai
 Are based on static dentistry theory
 sthitik danturata siddhant par aadhaarit brinelle kii kathorta-pareekshan-vidhi he, jiske anusaar parikshya padaarth ke ek bhaag par kaanch ke samaan badhiya polish kar usapar bahut kathor ispaat kii, maanak vyas kii, ek goli ko rakhkar yantron dwaara maanak bhaar se dabaate hai
 This causes round marks on the polished surface
 nishaan kaa vyas naapakar nimna sutara ke anusaar goli kaa kathortank nikaalte hai : If the diameter of the bullet is d and the diameter of the mark is d mm
 If it were jo crigra
 prati varg mimi
 main likhaa jaataa he
 The diameter of the bullet is usually 10 mm
 And 3,000 kg for iron and steel, 1,000 kg for soft metals like brass etc
 And 50 kg for very soft metal materials like sis etc
 Standard weights are kept
 saadharantaya bhaar itnaa hi rakhaa jaataa he jisase nishaan kaa vyas goli ke vyas ke 3 / 8 se adhik na ho
 The test can be done with a bullet of any diameter, but the ratio of pressure and diameter of the bullet, p / , should remain the same
 saamaanya kathorta ke liye ispaat kii goli or unchi kathorta ke liye heere kii goli prayukt hoti he
 Weight is given for 15 seconds on hard materials and 30 seconds on soft materials

 This creates a square crater, whose diagonal and depth can be measured more accurately
 isse kathortank is prakaar nikaala jaataa he: Numerous instruments based on dynamic dentistry have been made, of which Scalp made of noise is the most famous
 isamen ispaat kii belanaakaar hathaudi rahati he, jiskaa bhaar lagbhag 40 grain hota
 The hammer below the hammer has a convex hirakni, whose end area is about 0
01 to 0
25 square inch, whose end area is dropped from about 0
01 to 0
025 square inch, then it collides with the test material Leaps up

 The scale carries 140 marks
 kaanch kii uthaal 130, chid kii lakdi kii oochaal 40 or rabar kii oochaal 23 lagbhag hoti he
 The hardness obtained by this device multiplied by six is known as Brinell's hardness and by multiplying it by 6 or 0
22 and 1
32, the approximate peak strength of the substance, in tons per square inch, can be found
 isi prakaar upyukt sthiraankon se guna kar vibhinn padaarthon kii sampeden tathaa aparupak samathrya bhi maaloom ho sakati he
 Various types of forces are seen in the works of structural engineering
 inhen nimnlikhit chah pramukh virgon main baanta ja saktaa he: Various components are added by rebats, or by bolts
 ribaton dwaara bane jod sthaayee hote hai or katkar hi alag alag kiye ja sakate hai, par bolton dwaara jode gaye jod asthaayee hote hai or vibhinn upkhandon main kholkar alag alag kiye ja sakate hai
 All types of components in the structure work are made of rods and plates with various passages of soft steel
 chhadon ke pariched gol, chapate, ytaakar, el, tii athwa ech aadi ke aakaar ke hote hai
 When constructing large scissors in the factory itself, all their components are made by cutting different pieces according to the map and some smaller subdivisions are placed in the factory itself on the flat land and are put in place by the rebates in place; Then by lifting those connected subdivisions by means of cranes etc
, they sit in place and tighten them with bolts
 taanon or thaamon ke avyavon par kitna pratibal padataa he or isamen unke sahane yogya, prati varg inch niraapad pratibal se bhaag dekar, unka pariched ganit dwaara gyaat kar liya jaataa he or usee ke aadhaar par unka nirmaan hota he
 Dharnas and girders occupy a very important place in structured structures, because on them static, variable and movable loads of flat roofs, bridges, gantries, and overhanging paths etc
 are carried
 jab kisi sidhe avyav ke donon siron ko kisi majboot aadhaar par tikaakar, usapar bhaar ladaa jaataa he, tab vah dharan yaa garder kehalaata he
 By placing the burden on the handle, it can be stretched in the middle and if the burden on it is more than its strength, then its lower surface starts to burst
