 It appears from Mahasiddhanta that the things Brahmagupta has denied of Aryabhatta have been corrected
 kuttak kii vidhi main bhi aryabhatta pratham, bhaskar pratham tathaa bahmagupta kii vidhiyon se kuch unnati dikhaai padati he
 Hence there is no doubt that Aryabhata II is after Brahmagupta

 Sometimes it decreases to zero and sometimes increases to 173

 The Bhoodan movement was a voluntary land reform movement started in 1951 by Sant Vinoba Bhave
 vinoba kii koshish thi ki bhoomi kaa punarvitaran sirf sarkari kanoonon ke jariye nahin ho, balki ek andolan ke madhyam se isaki safal koshish kii jaae
 In order to make the Bhoodan movement a success in the fifties of the 20th century, Vinoba used ideas such as creative works and trusteeship, following Gandhian ideas
 unhone sarvoday samaaj kii sthapana kii
 It was the All India Association of Creative Workers
 iskaa uddeshy ahimsaatmak tareeke se desh main saamaajik parivartan laana tha
 It was dated April 18, 1951, when Acharya Vinoba Bhave received the first donation of land
 unhen yah jameen telugana kshetra main sthit pochampalli gaanv main daan main mili thi
 This was the beginning of the same Bhoodan movement of Vinoba, which is now recorded in the pages of history or in the memory of the old people
 tab vinoba padayatraaen karte or gaanv-gaanv jaakar bade bhuswamiyon se apni jameen kaa kam se kam chatha hissaa bhudaan ke rup main bhoomihin kisaanon ke bich baantne ke liye dene kaa anurodh karte the
 It was then targeted to acquire five crore acres of land, which was one-sixth of the 30 million acres of cultivable land in India
 us vakt praja socialist party ke netaa jaiprakash narayan bhi 1953 main bhudaan andolan main shaamil ho gaye the
 In the early days of the movement Vinoba had traveled to around 200 villages in the Telangana region and received 12,200 acres of land in charity
 iske baad andolan uttar bharat main failaa
 Its deep impact was seen in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 march 1956 tak daan ke rup main 40 lakh acre se bhi adhik jameen bataur daan mil chuki thi
 But since then, the force of the movement was shattered
 1955 tak aate-aate andolan ne ek nayaa rup dhaaran kiya
 It was identified as 'gramdan'
 iskaa arth tha ‘sari bhoomi gopal kii’
 All the lands in the villages of Gramdan were considered as collective ownership, over which all had equal rights
 isaki shuruyaat urisa se hui or ise kaaphi safalataa mili
 By 1960 there were over 4,500 Gramdan villages in the country
 inamen 1946 gaanv urisa ke the, jabaki maharashtra duusare sthaan par tha
 There were 603 Gramdan villages
 kaha jaataa he ki gramdaan vaale vichaar unheen sthanon par safal hue jahaan varg bhed ubhare nahin the
 That area was tribals only
 par badi ummiido ke baavjood saath ke dashak main bhudaan or gramdaan andolan kaa bal kamjor pad gaya
 In public opinion its creative abilities could not be generally used
 daan main mili 45 lakh acre bhoomi main se 1961 tak 8
72 lakh acre jameen garibon va bhoomihinon ke bich banti ja saki thi
 It is said that there were many reasons for this
 masalan- daan main mili bhoomi kaa acha-khaasaa hissaa kheti ke laayak nahin tha
 a lot of land was stuck in litigation, etc
 kul milakar ye baaten ab bhula di gai hai
 However, sometimes in the media, news about land found in Bhoodan keeps coming up
 acharya vinoba kaa bhudaan andolan logon ke jehan main rah gaya he
 In the opinion of experts, it was one of the first attempts after independence where land reforms were tried through constructive movement
 so logon ne badi koshishen kii hai, is samaaj ko aage laane kii
 Sadly, that effort remains stuck in political or official mazzaal

 The Kashmir dispute has been going on since 1947 between India and Pakistan over the authority over Kashmir
 isko lekar pakistan ne bharat par teen baar hamalaa kiya or tino baar use buree tarah se paraajay mili! 1971 ke yuddh main to bharat ne palatwaar karte hue pakistani sena ko islamabad tak khaded diya tha! or lagbhag aadhe pakistan par kabja kar liya parantu pakistan ke aatmasamarpan ke baad bharat ne udaartaa dikhaate huai jiti hui jameen punah lautaa di! In October 1947, Maharaja Harisingh, the then ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, signed a merger letter for the merger of his princely state with India
 governor general mountbeton ne 27 oktober ko ise manjuuri di
 The blueprint of the merger letter was exactly what the hundreds of other princely states who had joined India used to include their princely states in India
 na isamen koi shart shumaar thi or na hi riyasat ke liye vishesh darje jaisi koi maang
 As soon as this legal document was signed, the entire Jammu and Kashmir, including the illegally occupied area of pakistan, became an integral part of India
 ab ham baat karte hai ki kis tarah aadhe kashmir par kabja kiya gaya
 Here we will talk about Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh
 bharat ke is uttari rajya ke 3 kshetra hai- jammu, kashmir or ladakh
 Unfortunately, Indian politicians declared the region a state without understanding the geographical location of the region, as all three regions were under the same king
 sawaal yah uthta he ki aazaadee ke baad se hi jammu or ladakh bharat ke saath khush hai, lekin kashmir khush kyon nahin?haalanki visheshgy kehete hai ki pakistan kii chaal main philhal 2 fisadi kashmiri hi aae hai baaki sabhi bharat se prem karte hai
 Mehbooba Mufti has said this in one of her interviews
 landan ke researchron dwaara pichley saal rajya ke 6 jilon main karaae gaye survey ke anusaar ek vyakti ne bhi pakistan ke saath khadaa hone kii vakaalat nahin kii, jabaki kashmir main kattarpanthi algaavvaadi samay samay par isaki vakaalat karte rahete hai jab tak kii unako vahaan se aarthik madad milti rahati he
 From there the order comes closed and stoned and that order is served
 aatankwaad, algaavvaad, fasaad or dange- ye 4 shabd hai jinke madhyam se pakistan ne duniya ke kai mulkon ko pareshaan kar rakhaa he
 Especially, India is the most important target for him
 kyon? is ‘kyon’ ke kai jawab hai
 India has no clear policy
 bhartiya rajaneta nirnay lene se bhi darate hai yaa unamem shuturamurg pravriti viksit ho gai he
 Now they can not even think about the battle of r or Par because they keep fighting and making rhetoric all day
 seemaa par sainik mar rahe hai purvottar main jawan shahid ho rahe hai isaki bhartiya rajanetaaon ko koi chintaa nahin
 They also have to do politics on this
 kehete jarur hai ki deshhit ke liye sabhi ekajute hai lekin lagata nahin he
 These are notable: the matter is of Kashmir, then the people of Kashmir on both sides, whether they are Muslims or non-muslims, are leading lives and painful lives
 maje kar rahe hai to algaavvaadi, aatankwaadi or unke aakaa
 Their children roam around the country and abroad and live in all kinds of luxury
 bhartiya kashmir ke halaat to pakistani kashmir se kai guna zyada achche hai
 Many Muslim families from Pakistan occupied Kashmir have come and taken refuge in India
 pakistan ne donon hi taraf ke kashmir ko barbaad karke rakh diya he
 Neither the land nor the Kashmiri Muslims will benefit the land locked Azad country with an area equal to the 10th part of Bhutan
 pakistan or china kaa isse jarur bhala ho jayega or antat: yah hoga ki iske kuch hisse pakistan kha jayega or kuch ko china nigal legaa
 China has swallowed some part
 yah baat kattarpanthi kashmiriyon ko samaj main nahin aati or ve samajhnaa bhi nahin chaahate
 This is history: in 1947, partitioned India became independent
 us daur main bhartiya riyasaton ke vilay kaa kaary chal rahaa tha, jabaki pakistan main kabailiyon ko ekajute kiya ja rahaa tha
 Here the princely states of Junagadh, Kashmir, Hyderabad and Travancore were delaying the merger, while some independent states wanted
 iske chalate in rajyon main asthirataa faili thi
 The problem of merging Kashmir was more complex than the problem of Junagadh and Hyderabad
 kashmir main musalmaan bahusankhyak the lekin panditon kii taadaad bhi kam nahin thi
 The problem was complicated due to the border of Kashmir with Pakistan, so Jinnah immediately started working on a plan to occupy Kashmir
 haalanki bharat or pakistan kaa bantwaaraa ho chukaa tha jisamen kshetron kaa nirdhaaran bhi ho chukaa tha phir bhi jinna ne paristhiti kaa laabh uthaate hue 22 oktober 1947 ko kabaili luteron ke bhesh main pakistani sena ko kashmir main bhej diya
 Rivers of blood were washed away in present-day occupied Kashmir
 is khooni khel ko dekhakar kashmir ke shaasha raja harisingh bhaybheet hokar jammu laut aae
 There he demanded military assistance from India, but it was too late to reach aid
 nehru kii jinna se dosti thi
 They could not think that Jinnah would do something like this
 lekin jinna ne aise kar diya
 At the time of partition of India, the issue of Kashmir remained unresolved due to wavering policy and short-sightedness of the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 yadi puraa kashmir pakistan main hota yaa puraa kashmir bharat main hota to shaayad paristhitiyaan kuch or hotin
 But this could not happen, because Kashmir was ruled by King Harisingh and after a long time he decided that Kashmir should be merged with India
 der se kiye gaye is nirnay ke chalate pakistan ne gilgit or baltistan main kabyli bhejkar lagbhag aadhe kashmir par kabja kar liya
 The Indian Army was advancing rapidly, rescuing the Pakistani Army's sixes, reclaiming the Kashmiri territory they had occupied, that on 31st December 1947, Nehruji appealed to the UNO to call on the north-west robbers of Pakistan
 Prevented from invading India
 falswaroop 1 janvari 1949 ko bharat-pakistan ke madhya yuddh-viraam kii ghoshnaa karai gai
 Earlier in 1948, Pakistan disguised its army into Indian Kashmir in the form of tribesmen and tried to capture the entire valley, which failed
 nehruji ke yuano main chale jane ke kaaran yudhviram ho gaya or bhartiya sena ke haath bandha gaye jisase pakistan dwaara kabja kiye gaye shesh kshetra ko bhartiya sena praapt karne main phir kabhi safal na ho saki
 Today, half of the area in Kashmir is the Line of Control and in some areas the international border
 antarrashtriya seemaa se lagaataar firing or ghuspaith hoti rahati he
 After this, Pakistan tried to occupy Kashmir in 1965 with its military force, due to which it had to face mouth
 is yuddh main pakistan kii haar hui
 Stung by the defeat, Pakistan acted to spread hatred towards India and the entire politics of Pakistan became based on Kashmir, that is, if you want power, then talk about seizing Kashmir
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki 1971 main usne phir se kashmir ko kabjane kaa prayaas kiya
 Then the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi fought it out and eventually 1 lakh soldiers of Pakistan Army surrendered to the Army of India and an independent country called 'bangladesh' was born
 indira gandhi ne yahaan ek badi bhul kii
 If she wanted to, the problem of Kashmir would have been solved here forever, but she came under the influence of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and 1 lakh soldiers were released
 is yuddh ke baad pakistan ko samaj main aa gai ki kashmir hathiyaane ke liye aamane-saamne kii ladaai main bharat ko haraa paanaa mushkil hi hoga
 After a humiliating defeat in 1971, soldiers were sworn in to revenge the defeat at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kabul, and preparations for the next war began to be carried out but the situation in Afghanistan began to deteriorate
 1971 se 1988 tak pakistan kii sena or kattarpanthi afghanistan main uljhe rahe
 Here the Pakistan army strengthened itself in guerrilla warfare and learned new methods as options for war
 yahi tareeke ab bharat par aajamaae jane lage
 He first showed Sikhs' dream of 'khalistan' in Pakistani Punjab and helped to set up an organization of armed Sikhs to launch terrorism in Indian Punjab
 pakistan ke is khel main bharat sarkaar ulajhati gai
 The politics of India changed after the assassination of Mrs
 Indira Gandhi on 31 October 1984 as an unfortunate Operation Blue Star in Golden Temple and its revenge action
 ek shaktishaalee netaa kii jagah ek anubhav or vichaarheen netaa rajeev gandhi ne jab desh kii bagdor sanbhali to unke aalochak kehane lage the ki unke paas koi yojana nahin or koi niti bhi nahin he
 Many people rejected what he said during the 1984 riots
 unhone kashmir kii taraf se puri tarah se dhyaan hataakar punjab or srilanka main laga diya
 The road to India changed after Indira Gandhi
 punjab main aatankwaad ke is nae khel ke chalate pakistan kii najar ek baar phir muslim bahul bhartiya kashmir kii ore tik gai
 He started preparing people for terror in Pak occupied Kashmir
 afghanistan kaa anubhav yahaan kaam aane laga tha
 The then President General zia-ul-haq planned a 'war with low intensity' against India in 1988 under the name 'operation Topak'
 is yojana ke tahat bhartiya kashmir ke logon ke man main algaavvaad or bharat ke prati nafrat ke beej bone the or phir unheen ke haathon main hathiyaar thamane the
 After many mouths, Pakistan began to think of a new kind of war against its more powerful enemy in the 90s and eventually called it 'war of Low Intensity'
 darasal, yah gorilla yuddh kaa hi viksit rup he
 Indian politicians knew everything but still they were silent, because they were worried about more votes than India, worried about alliances, worrying about staying in power
 bhartiya rajanetaaon ke is dhulmul ravaiye ke chalate kashmir main ‘oparation topaak’ bagaiyr kisi pareshaani ke chalata rahaa or bhartiya rajaneta shuturamurg banakar satta kaa sukh lete rahe
 Except for Kashmir and the Northeast, Indian politicians kept paying attention everywhere
 ‘oparation topaak’ pehle se duusare or duusare se tisare charan main pahunch gaya
 Now his intention was not only to keep Kashmir disturbed, he started being active in Jammu and Ladakh too
 pakistani sena or iesai ne milakar kashmir main dange karaae or uske baad aatankwaad kaa silsilaa chal padaa
 Increasing the number of mosques in the first phase, evacuating non-muslims and Shias from Kashmir in the second phase and preparing the public for rebellion in the third phase
 ab iskaa chauthaa or antim charan chal rahaa he
 Now Pakistani flags are waved publicly and openly against India, because there are no non-muslim nor Shias in the Kashmir Valley
 kashmir main aatankwaad ke chalate kareeb 7 lakh se adhik kashmiri pandit visthapit ho gaye or ve jammu sahit desh ke anya hisson main jaakar rahane lage
 During this time thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were killed
 haalanki abhi bhi kashmir ghati main lagbhag 3 hajaar kashmiri pandit rahete hai lekin ab ve ghar se kam hi baahar nikal pate hai
 According to former UK Foreign Minister Jack Straw, problems like the Kashmir dispute and the arab-israel conflict are a product of Britain's colonial past
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke samay britani shashan ne dhulmul ravaiya apanaaya tha jo is vivaad kaa kaaran bana
 Senior BJP leader and MP Shanta Kumar said that the dispute in Kashmir was a gift of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country
 aazaadee ke baad pakistan sena ne hamalaa kar diya or iske jawaab main jab bhartiya sena ne akraman kiya to puure kashmir ko jeetne se pehle hi bharat sarkaar ne yuddh viraam kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Sartaj Aziz, the Prime Minister's advisor on Pakistan's foreign affairs and national security, raised the Kashmir dispute as the main issue between the two countries
 pradhan mantri nawaz sharif ne paak adhikrut kashmir kii vidhansabha main ek satr ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki jab tak kashmiri janata kii mahatvakankshaon ke anusaar is vivaad kaa hal nahin kiya jaataa, yah kshetra ‘avishvaas or tanaav’ kii giraft main bana rahegaa
 The indo-pakistan War of 1947–1948, sometimes known as the First Kashmir War, was fought between India and Pakistan between the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu from 1947 to 1948
 yah chaar bharat-pakistan yudhon main se pehla tha do nae swatantra raashtra kashmir ko surakshit karne ke prayaas main pakistan ne wajiristaan se adivasee lashkar kaa shubharambh karke aazaadee ke kuch hafton baad pakistan yuddh shuru kar diya tha, jisaki bhavishya main shesh raashi main lataka hua tha
 The inconclusive outcome of the war still affects the geopolitics of both countries
 maharaja ko poonch main apane muslim vishyon dwaara vidroh kaa saamana karnaa padaa, or apane rajya ke pashchimi jilon par niyantran kho diya
 On 22 October 1947, the Pashtun tribal forces of Pakistan crossed the state's border

 Hari Singh filed a petition for aid to India and was offered assistance, but it was subject to the signing of a means of negotiating a settlement for India
 yuddh shuru main jammu evam kashmir rajya balon or uttar pashchimi simavarti praant se jude frontier adivasee ilaakon se adivaasiyon dwaara ladaa gaya tha
 After the entry of the state, Indian forces were lifted into the air from the state capital, Srinagar
 british cmanderon ke adhikariyon ne shuru main pakistan ke sainikon ko bharat main pravesh ke hawaale se sangharsh main pravesh se inkaar kar diya
 However, later in 1948, they were worried and Pakistani forces entered the war thereafter
 niyantran rekha ke rup main janaa jane ke saath-saath morchon ko dhire-dhire drudh kiya gaya
 a formal ceasefire was declared at 23:59 on the night of 31 December 1948
 : 37 9 yuddh kaa parinaam anirnaayak tha
 However, most neutral assessments believe that India was the winner of the war as it was able to successfully defend nearly two-thirds of Kashmir, including the Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Ladakh
 1965 main bharat-pakistan yuddh pakistan or bharat ke bich april 1965 or sitambar 1965 ke bich hui jhadpon kii parinti thi
 The conflict began after Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to force troops into Jammu and Kashmir to revolt against Indian rule
 bharat ne pashchimi pakistan par ek purna paimaane par sainya hamale shuru karne kaa zikr kiya
 The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and saw the largest participation of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II
 sanyukt raashtra ke anivaary yudhviram ke baad soviet sangh or sanyukt rajya dwaara rajanyik hastkshep ke baad ghoshit kiye jane or taashkand ghoshnaptr ke baad jari hone ke baad donon deshon ke bich kii ladaai samaapt ho gai
 Most of the war was fought in Kashmir by the ground forces of the country and the border between India and Pakistan
 1 9 47 main british bharat ke vibhaajan ke baad se is yuddh ne kashmir main sainikon kaa sabase bada hathiyaar dekha, jo ki bharat or pakistan ke bich 2001-2002 ke sainya gatirodh ke dauraan hi dhanke hue the
 Most battleships fought infantry and armored units, with substantial support from the Air Force, and naval operations
 yuddh ne pakistan ke sainya prashikshan ke aparyaapt maanakon, iske gumraahe ke chayan ke adhikariyon, garib cmand or niyantran vyavastha, kharaab khufia jaankaree or buree budhimatta prakriyaaon kaa pardaafash kiya
 Despite these shortcomings, the Pakistani Army managed to fight the larger Indian Army

 In other words, job analysis is a formal and detailed inspection of tasks
 yah kisi kaary ke vishay main soochnaaon ke sangrahan kii ek prakriya he
 Thus, job analysis is the systematic research of the subject matter of the work, the physical conditions under which the work is performed and the qualifications required to fulfill the responsibilities of the work

 macormik ke anusaar, ml
 According to Blum, edwin bi
 philippo ke anusaar, Job analysis is a very important foundation for all human resource management activities
 iske visheshikrut uddeshyon ko nimnlikhit prakaar se samajha ja saktaa haih Job analysis is the explanatory study of various aspects of one's work, which includes the duties, responsibilities, nature and conditions of work and the capabilities and qualifications required for work

 required for the execution of the work

 Features of good job description: The following points should be kept in mind while recording the job description: kaary vishistataa kaary ko santoshjanak rup se sampadit karne ke liye apekshit maanviya visheshtaon kaa ek sankshipt vivaran prastut karata he
 It describes the necessary qualifications in a person to complete a job successfully
 kaary vishistataa, ek kaary vivaran kii ek taarkik apvriddhi hoti he
 For each job description, it is desirable to have the job specification
 yah sanghathan ko, ek kaary vishesh kaa uttardaayitv dene hetu kis prakaar ke vyakti kii aavashyaktaa he, iskaa pataa lagane main sahaayta pradaan karata he
 Employee specificity is related to human abilities or characteristics and does not refer to those qualifications that indicate human abilities
 paatrata, yogyataon kaa maapan karne kaa ek maanak he, jo kuch nishchit yogyataon, nipunataaon tathaa gyaan aadi ke swaamitv kaa pramanit karata he
 Hence, employee exclusivity is a description of a post-holder's minimum required qualifications for a job, such as physical, educational, psychological and social, etc
, which describes the minimum human qualifications required to perform the job from a prospective employee
 Does
 ek pad ko bharne ke liye kis prakaar ke vyakti kii aavashyaktaa he, yah gyaat karne kii uddeshy se kaary vishistataa kii soochnaaon ko, karmchaaree vishistataa kii soochnaaon main parivartit karnaa aavashyak he
 Employee exclusivity is similar to a popular 'production name', which leads to the finding that a candidate with a particular employee specialty is often equipped with the human qualifications mentioned under the job specification

 After some time the story moves forward a few years when both Akshara's children Naksh and Naira grow up
 yahan kahani naksh ke ird gird gumti he
 At the same time Naira leaves her house due to a misunderstanding
 iske baad kahani kuch varsh or aage badhati he or akshara apni beti ko dhund leti he kuch samay baad akshara kii maut ho jaati hai
 And finally the story revolves around Akshara's daughter Naira
 The story continues with an ideal family and husband-wife relationship
 ye rishta kya kehalaata he shuruyaat main ek yuva jode, akshara or naitik singhania kii kahani thi, jo udaipur main marwari sanyukt parivaar main rahete the
 The story goes through adjustment issues as a married couple, as parents of young children, and they learn to love each other as their extended families mature
 ab kahani naira or karthik goyanka par ek yuva mode ke saath naira ke mata-pita ke samaan yatra kaa saamana kar rahi he
 After the accident, Naitik falls into a coma
 naksh ab 5 he or apane pita ke bare main nahin jaanata he
 Naksh is still a child and the family is happy together and sometimes unhappy
 ek din, naitik coma se uth jate hai or haalanki pehle naksh apane pita kaa swaagat nahin karte hai, baad main vah unhen apane jivan main sweekaar kar letaa he
 One day the whole family goes on a journey
 lekin is dauraan gayatri ke saath durghatana ho jaati he or uski maut ho jaati he
 Now Rajasekhar is asked to marry someone, and he marries Devayani, who comes from a divorced marriage with her two children

 Later, Bhabhima's husband grandfather dies of a heart attack, and Bhabhima accuses Akshara of her husband's death and leaves her out of the house
 akshara, naitik, naksh or naira ghar chhod kar chale jate hai
 Naksh and Naira grow up after ten years

 Naksh is now a mature adult and Naira is a divine teenager
 naksh udaipur laut aata he

 kai dinon ke baad, akshara ko maafee mil jaati he or wo apane pati naitik or donon bacchon naksh or naira ke saath waapas apane ghar, bharat laut aati he
 After this the story focuses on Naksh

 The marriage of both is also decided
 donon parivaar shaadi kii taiyaariyon main jute jate hai

 saat saalon ke baad, ab sho kii kahani naira par kendrit ho jaati he
 She continues to hate her mother, Akshara, due to which she lives away from her home in Rishikesh
 naira kaa pataa chalane or uske ghar lautne ke baad kahani main ek nayaa mode aa jaataa he

 atah, kahani ek nayaa mode leti he - ek prem trikon jo karthik, naira or gaayu ke bich he
 Naira and Karthik have feelings for each other but do not know that it is love
 is bich, gaayu karthik se pyaar karata he, is baat se anjaan he ki karthik use waapas pyaar nahin karata he
 When Karthik proposes to Naira, she initially rejects him, but by the time she realizes that Gayu loves her too, she thinks about sacrificing her happiness in favor of Gayu
 
 ek din naira ko karthik apane dil kii baat bataata he, lekin naira manaa kar detii he
 But shortly after, she realizes that she too has fallen in love with Karthik
 par use ye bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki gaayu bhi karthik se pyaar karti he, is kaaran wo apane pyaar kii qurbaani de detii he
 When Mishti reveals that Karthik only loves Naira, Karthik and Naira confess their love for each other
 karthik keval naira se hi pyaar karata he, to naira or karthik donon apane pyaar kaa ikraar kar dete hai
 Gayu then understands this and sacrifices his love for his sister
 gaayu is baat ko samaj jaati he ki karthik usase kabhi pyaar nahin karegaa
 Karthik does not want to talk about his family because he hates them
 use lagata he ki uski maan kii uske pita or uski sauteli maan ne hatya kii he
 Karthik does not like his father and stepmother as he feels they were responsible for his mother's death
 is kaaran shaadi kii baat unase nahin karata he
 At the same time the party is organized on the day of Akshara's birthday, everyone goes to worship, but at the same time Akshara dies in a car accident
 singhania parivaar akshara kii maut ke liye karthik ko doshi tehraata he kyonki wo durghatana sthal par apane gaadi ke saath nashe kii haalat main paaya jaataa he
 Karthik's family tries to save his son and supports him
 baad main naira ko pataa chalaa ki karthik apradhi nahin he
 He learns that Karthik is innocent and the accused is someone else
 naira asli apradhi ko dhundhakar karthik ko bekasoor sabit kar detii he
 Karthik's family approves of Naira and Karthik's relationship, given Karthik's feelings towards the Singhania family, despite Naira's family not being very much in favor
 donon parivaar naira or karthik kii shaadi ke liye taiyaari karnaa shuru karte hai
 Naira is called to the Goenka residence for the tilak ceremony
 shaadi se thik pehle karthik ko pataa chalata he ki akshara ko gaadi se takkar maarane vaali uski chacheri bahan maanasi he, wo ye sachai naira ko bataane hi vaala rahata he ki uske chachaa akhilesh use sachai na bataane ke liye manaa lete hai or use wo naira ko sachai bataa detaa
 Before marriage, Karthik learns that Akshara is a Mansi to be hit by a car, he is about to tell the truth to Naira that her uncle Akhilesh convinces her not to tell Naira the truth and he tells Karthik
 That he will tell Naira the truth
 lekin akhilesh naira ko itnaa hi bataate he ki karthik apni maan ko yaad kar rahaa he is kaaran dukhi he
 Karthik and Naira get married
 shaadi ke agle din hi use yaad aata he ki naira ne suvarna se vaada kiya tha ki wo karthik ko goyanka nivas se dur rakhegi
 Due to this, Karthik takes him to a different house on the same day

 This finding is generally more convincing for men than women, although the gender pattern is not universal in all studies, and some results suggest gender-based differences in only certain causes of mortality and self-assessment of health in certain age groups Some appear for specific sub-groups

 Common methods of disinfection include - ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite
 Chlorine is not used in wastewater treatment because of the continuum of chlorine used for drinking water
 chlorinikaran apni kam laagat or prabhaavashiltaa ke dirghakaalik itihaas kii vajah se uttar america main apshisht jal keetanushodhan kaa sabase aam rup bana hua he
 a disadvantage of this is that chlorination of residual organic matter can produce chlorine-containing organic compounds that can be carcinogenic or environmentally harmful
 avshish chlorine yaa chlormin main prakritik jaleey vaataavaran main carbonic padaarthon kaa chlorinikaran karne kii kshamta bhi ho sakati he
 In addition, since residual chlorine is toxic to aquatic species, treated wastewater must be chemically chlorinated, increasing the complexity and cost of treatment
 chlorine, iodine, yaa anya rasayanon kii jagah parabangnee prakaash kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Due to the non-use of chemicals, treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that consume it later, while with other methods, there may be other issues
 yuvi vikiran kii vajah se jeevanu, vishaanu or anya rogaanuon kii anuvanshik sanrachana kshatigrast ho jaati he jisase unamem prajnan shakti samaapt ho jaati he
 The major disadvantages of UV disinfection are the frequent maintenance and replacement of the lamps and the need for highly purified effluent to ensure that the targeted microorganisms are not shielded from UV radiation

 Edmonton and Calgary, Alberta and Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada also use UV light for their effluent water disinfection
 sanlagn hone or O3 kaa nirmaan karne vaale oxigen ke tisare parmaanu main parinat karne vaale ek ucch voltage vibhav se hokar oxigen O2 ke guzarane par ozone O3 utpann hota he
 Ozone is very volatile and reactive and it oxidizes most of the organic material it comes in contact with, destroying many pathogenic microorganisms
 chlorine kii tulana main ozone ko zyada surakshit mana jaataa he kyonki site par sangrahit kiye jane vaale chlorine ke vipareet, ozone ko aavashyaktaanusaar site par hi utpann kiya jaataa he
 Ozonization produces fewer disinfection byproducts than chlorination
 ozone keetanushodhan se hone vaala ek nuksaan yah he ki ozone utpann karne vaale upkaran kii laagat adhik hoti he or vishesh parichaalkon kii jarurat padati he
 Deodorant emitted from sewage treatment is usually an indication of an anaerobic or "septic" condition
 prasanskaran ke praarambhik charnon main badboodaar gas, sabase aam taur par hydrogen sulphide, utpann hone lagate hai
 In large-scale processing plants in urban areas, these odors are often combined with carbon reactors, a contact media with bio-clay soils, small amounts of chlorine, or liquids to generate unpleasant gases biologically controlled and metabolized
 It is circulated and treated
 durgandh niyantran ke anya tareekon ke tahat hydrogen sulphide ke str ko prabandhit karne ke liye isamen louh lavan, hydrogen paroxide, calcium nitrate, ityadi milaayaa jaataa he
 In order to use less space and to treat difficult waste materials and for intermittent flow, several designs of hybrid treatment plants have been made
 aise sanyantr aksar prashodhan ke teen mukhya charnon main se kam se kam do charnon ko ek sanyukt charan main sanyukt kar dete hai
 In the UK, where large-scale wastewater treatment plants serve small populations, a package plant is a viable option to build a large structure for each processing stage
 dwitiyak prashodhan evam niptaan ko ek saath sanyukt karne vaali ek prakaar kii pranali - krambaddh batch riector he
 Typically, catalyzed sludge is mixed with raw incoming sewage and then mixed and aerated
 mukhya kaary ke liye tali main baithe hue keechad ke ansh ke waapas aane se pehle use baha diya jaataa he or phir se vaatit kar diya jaataa he
 SBR plants are now being installed in many parts of the world

 Package plants can be referred to as high charged or low charged
 yah us tareeke ko sanderbhit karata he jis tareeke jaivik bhaar ko prasanskrit kiya jaataa he
 In highly charged systems, the organic phase is presented with a high organic load and combined floc and then oxygenated for a few hours before the organic material is charged again with a new load

 The sludge collected in a wastewater treatment process should be treated and discharged in a safe and effective manner
 apghaton kaa uddeshy carbonic padaarth kii maatra or thos padaarthon main maujuud rog paidaa karne vaale sookshm jeevon kii sankhya ko kam karnaa he
 The most common treatment options include anaerobic decomposition, pneumatic decomposition and composting
 yadhyapi bahut kam had tak bhasmeekaran kaa bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Sludge treatment depends on the amount of solids generated and other location-specific conditions
 khaad-nirmaan kii kriya aksar sabase zyada laghu stareey sanyantron ke liye madhyam aakaar vaale sanchalanon ke liye viviya apghaton or deergh stareey sanchalanon ke liye avayaviya apghaton ke saath lagu kii jaati he
 Anaerobic decomposition is a bacterial process performed in the absence of oxygen
 yah prakriya yaa to thermophilic apghaton ho sakati he, jisamen keechad ko 55 degree celsius taapmaana par tankiyon main kinvit kiya jaataa he, yaa yah prakriya mesophilic apghaton ho sakati he, jisamen keechad ko lagbhag 36 degree celsius taapmaana par kinvit kiya jaataa he
 Although its retention time is very short, thermophilic decomposition is more expensive in terms of energy consumption for heating sludge

 Pneumatic decomposition is a bacterial process that occurs in the presence of oxygen
 viviya paristhitiyon ke tahat, jeevanu teji se carbonic padaarthon kaa upbhog karata he or ise carbon dioxide main badal detaa he
 Operating costs for pneumatic decomposition are high because the energy used by the blowers, pumps, and motors requires oxygen in the process
 haalanki, oxijnikaran ke liye prakritik vaayu dhaaraon kaa istemaal karne vaali pathar fibre filter praudyogiki ke aagaman ke baad se iskaa istemaal ab nahin kiya jaataa he
 This pneumatic decomposition can also be accomplished by using diffuser systems or jet aerators to oxidize the sludge
 khaad-nirmaan bhi ek viviya prakriya he jiske tahat keechad ko carbon ke sroton, jaise - lakdi kaa buraada, bhusa yaa lakdi kaa tukdaa, ke saath mishrit kiya jaataa he
 In the presence of oxygen, the bacteria decompose both the solids of the wastewater and the carbon source added and produce a large amount of heat while doing so
 nimna ushmiya gun vaale keechad ko jalaane or avshisht jal ko vashpikrut karne ke liye aavashyak poorak eendhan or vaayu utsarjan kii chintaaon kii vajah se keechad ke bhasmeekaran kii prakriya kaa istemaal bahut kam hota he
 Wastewater sludge combustion is the most widely used step-by-step multi-stove furnace and fluidized bottom furnace
 nagarpalika ke apshisht-se-urja sanyantron main kabhi-kabhaar sah-agnikaran kiya jaataa he, kam mahangaa hone kii vajah se is vikalp kothos apshisht ke liye pehle se maujuud suvidhaon ke rup main apana liya gaya he or iske liye kisi sahaayak eendhan kii jarurat nahin he
 When liquid sludge is produced, further treatment may be needed to make it suitable for final removal
 aamtaur par, nishkasana ke liye sthaan se dur le jane ke liye keechad maatra ko kam karne ke liye ise gadha kiya jaataa he
 There is no process that can completely eliminate the need for removal of organic solids
 haalanki, keechad ko bahut zyada garm karne or ise chote-chote golinuma daanon main parivartit karne ke liye kuch shaharon main ek atirikt kadam uthaae ja rahe hai jinamein bahut adhik nitrogen or anya carbonic padaarth hote hai
 In New York City, for example, several sewage treatment plants have hydroelectricity facilities where large centrifuges are used, along with the addition of chemicals such as polymer to remove excess fluid from the sludge
 centret naamak is nishkasit taral padaarth ko aam taur par apshisht jal prashodhan prakriya main phir se prashodhit kiya jaataa he
 The rest is called a "cake" that many companies buy at a lower price and convert it into fertilizer pellets
 uske baad is utpaada ko ek mitti sanshodhan yaa urvarak ke rup main sthaneey kisaanon or trikhaachhadit kheton ko bech diya jaataa he, jisase bhumibharan kshetron main keechad ko nishkasit karne ke liye kam sthaan kii jarurat padati he
 Many processes in a wastewater treatment plant are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes occurring in the environment, whether the environment is a natural water body or land
 If not overloaded, bacteria present in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce oxygen levels in the water and can significantly alter the overall ecology of receiving water
 mul jeevanvik jansankhya carbonic sandooshit padaarthon par apana bharan-poshan karti hai or rogotpadak sookshmjivon kii sankhya parabangnee vikiran ke shikaar yaa jokhim jaisi prakritik paryaavarniya paristhitiyon dwaara kam ho jaati hai
 As a result, high-level wastewater treatment may not be required in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution
 haalanki, haal hi main praapt sabooton se is baat kaa pataa chalaa he ki yadi jal ko peya jal ke rup main phir se istemaal kiya jaataa he to apshisht jal main bahut kam maatra main paae jane vaale hormone or apane kaaryon main hormone kii nakal karne vaale phthalet jaisi synthetic samagriyon sahit vishisht sandooshit padaarthon kaa prakritik jeev jagat or sambhawatah maanav jati par apratyaashit rup se pratikul prabhaav pad saktaa he
 In the United States and the European Union, law does not allow uncontrolled discharge of wastewater into the environment and meet stringent water quality requirements
 aane vaale dashakon main teevr vikasshil deshon ke bheetar apshisht jal kaa badhata hua aniyantrit nishkasana ek bahut bada khatra ban jayega
 Some reliable data on the participation of stored wastewater in the drains being treated worldwide still exists
 kai vikasshil deshon main adhikansh gharelu or audyogic apshisht jal ko bina kisi prashodhan ke yaa keval praathmik prashodhan ke baad nishkasit kar diya jaataa he
 About 15 percent of the waste water stored in Latin America passes through treatment plants
 apshisht jal prashodhan ke sambandh main dakshin america ke venezuela naamak ek nimna ausat desh main utpann malajal main se 97 pratishat malajal ko paryaavaran main aprishkrut rup main hi nishkasit kar diya jaataa he
 In a relatively developed country in the Middle East such as Iran, most of Tehran's population diverts completely untreated sewage into the city's groundwater
 israel main, krishigat upyog hetu pradaan kiye jane vaale jal main se lagbhag 50 pratishat jal naaliyon kaa punarnirmit jal hota he
 Future plans need to include the use of treated sewage as well as plans to install more desalination plants

 Every week many types of people gathered in the society and went away listening to the Bhajan discourse
 isse adhik kuch nahin
 Devendranath's arrival in the Brahma Samaj brought new life to him
 san 1847 main unhone tatvabodhini sabha ko ek pratigya se parichit karaayaa
 In this vow, it was said that each member of the Brahmas Samaj would be saved from evil deeds, would worship God with a sincere heart and would offer something to the Brahmas Samaj on the occasion of family happiness
