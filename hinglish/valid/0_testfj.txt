 margerine kai khaadya padaarthon or vyanjanon kii taiyaari kaa ek ghatak he, tathaa bolchaal kii bhashaa main is kabhi-kabhi oliyo kaha jaataa he
 Margarine naturally appears white or almost white: By prohibiting the addition of artificial dyeing factors, legislators have found in some jurisdictions that they can protect their dairy industry, discouraging consumption of margarine
 america, austrlaysia or canada main rang milaane par roak aam baat ho gai; or kuch maamalon main, ye pratibandh lagbhag 100 saal tak bane rahe
 For example, until 1960, the sale of colored margarine was not legal in Australia

 In 1853, the German structural chemist, Wilhelm Heinrich Heintz, analyzed organic acid as simply a combination of stearic acid and previously unknown palmitic acid
 1869 main, france ke samraat luis nepolian III ne sashastr balon or nichle virgon ke upayogaanukool, makkhan kaa santoshjanak sthanapann padaarth banane vaale ko puraskaar kii peshkash kii
 The French chemist Hippolite mege-maurice invented a substance called oleomargarine, which remained confined to the trade name "margarine"
 mege-moris ne 1869 main avadharana ko patent karaayaa or france se apane praarambhik nirmaan kaary kaa vistaar kiya, par adhik vyavsaayik safalataa hasil nahin ho pai
 1871 main, unhone dach company jargans ko patent bechaa, jo ab uniliver kaa hissaa he
 Since 1877, the first United States states had passed laws prohibiting the sale and labeling of margarine
 1880 dashak ke madhya tak, sangheey sarkaar ne do saint prati pound kaa kar pravartit kiya tha or nirmaataaon ke liye utpaada taiyaar karne or bechney ke liye mahange license kii zarurat thi
 a clear label of margarine was needed for individual states
 neuyork or new jersey deyari rajyon main makkhan kii lobby dwaara praroopit rang par roak shuru ho chukaa tha
 In many states, legislatures enacted laws making it necessary for margarine makers to mix pink to make the product tasteless, but the Supreme Court rejected New Hampshire's law and rescinded these actions
 20veen sadi kii shuruuaat tak, das americanyon main se aath pilaa margerine nahin kharid sakate the or jo samarth the unhen us par baari kar chukaana padataa tha
 Illegal colored margarine became common, and manufacturers began supplying food-coloring capsules so that consumers could rub the margarine yellow before serving
 Nevertheless, regulations and taxes had a significant effect: for example, the 1902 restrictions on the color of margarine reduced US annual consumption from 120 million to 48 million pounds
 tathaapi, 1910 dashak ke ant tak, yah pehle se kahin zyaada lokapriy ho gaya tha
 With the advent of the First World War, margarine consumption also increased enormously in safe areas such as the Americas
 yuddh-kshetra ke nikatatam deshon main, deyari utpaada lagbhag nayab ban gaye or un par sakhti se rashan lagu kiya gaya
 For example, the United Kingdom relied on Australia and New Zealand for imported butter, and the risk of intermittent attack meant very little cargo would reach there
 margerine or deyari lobiyon ke bich dirghakaalin aarthik-labharjan kii hode jari rahi: america main maha mandi deyari-samarthak kaanoon kii naveekrut lahar le ai; dwitiya vishwa yudgh, margerine kii ore waapas gatisheel hua
 After the war, the margarine lobby gained power and gradually, major margarine restrictions were lifted, the most recent states to do so include Minnesota in 1963 and winconsin in 1967
 Nevertheless, some unenforceable laws exist in the books
 canada main, margerine par 1886 se 1948 tak pratibandh lagaaya gaya tha, haalanki deyari kii kami ke kaaran 1917 se 1923 tak asthaayee taur par yah pratibandh hataa liya gaya tha

 Similar to saturated fatty acids, a linear gradient exists between the intake of trans fatty acids and LDL cholesterol saturation and therefore by increased LDL cholesterol levels and decreased HDL cholesterol levels, there is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease
 
 kyonki hydrogenikrut telon main prakritik telon kii apeksha adhik trans band shaamil hote hai, aam taur par unhen adhik hanikaarak mana jaataa he
