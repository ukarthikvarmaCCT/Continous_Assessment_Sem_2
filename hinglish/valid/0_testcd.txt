 The aim of the contract for web is to bring government institutions, companies and end users together and develop them by implementing policies

 If we let the web stay like this, then on a much larger scale, things can get worse

 ) unhone bataaya ki is haadase main rohit, praveen or sanjay kii ghatnasthal par hi maut ho gayi
 The seriously injured Atul and Laxmi have been admitted to the district hospital
 police ne shavon kaa postmortem karaayaa he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 )(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) varanasi kii sankari or tang galiyon main agar aag lag jaae to kya hoga ye sawaal aap sab ke dimag main aa saktaa he
 But now Varanasi's fire brigade is ready to deal with it, as his squad joins the motorcycle fire brigade squad to go down these narrow streets
 sirf yahi nahin badi gadiyon kii jagah jeep main bhi fire dasta taiyaar he, jo thodi sankari sadakon main aag par kaabo paane kaa kaam karegaa
 a motorbike fire brigade playing siren immediately sets out to control the fire in the narrow streets of Benares
 banaras main trephic jam bhi ek badi samasya he, lekin is jam se ve logon nahin funsate jo cycle yaa motor cycle se hon or unhen banaras kii galiyon kaa gyaan ho
 These fire brigade squad are on a motorcycle and they also have knowledge of the interconnected lanes, so they reach these narrow streets within a few minutes and take whatever container filled with water and chemical behind them to the house
 Parts are set on fire and they are overcome immediately
 yah dekhne main ek dam aam motor cycle jaisi hi he
 There is something special in this, two cylinders fitted in it, hooter siren, light and foam chemical with 9 liters of water to overcome the fire
 aag agar choti hoti he, to itane se hi kaabo main aa jaati he agar nahin aa paati to isamen vahiin se pani bhar kar istemaal karte hai
 Apart from this, this squad also keeps a separate chemical for itself
 pichley kuch maheenon main taqariban 15 baar silendar or duusari choti aag ko bada banane se pehle buja chuke hai
 Significantly, Banaras is a city of narrow streets, where a large population lives
 in sankari galiyon ko jodne ke liye jo sadake hai, vah bhi itani chaudee nahin ki usame fire brigade kii badi gaadi ja sake, lihaaja uske liye ek water mist he or saath hi pressor jeep bhi he
 It has a 50 liter chemical foam tank with a 200 liter water tank and a 30 meter long pipe, which can be folded up to 90 meters
 vah in motor cycle daste ke peeche ke byaap kaa kaam karata he
 Not only this, Benaras is also the Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency
 yahaan kaa fire brigade aag se ladane kii puri taiyaari kiye hue he
 a fire brigade with a 42 meter long hydrolink platform costing about four and a half crores has also arrived from Italy, which is currently only in Lucknow after Banaras across the state
 is brigade se banaras kii badalati tasviir kii badi building main lagi aag, logon ko rescue karne jaisi museebaton main kaam aegi 
 However, the challenge of dealing with fire has been huge all the time and this is the reason why new technology is being developed
 galiyon ke shahar banaras main yah chunauti or badi hoti jaati he, lekin is fire brigade ke daste ke aane se isse kuch raahat zarur mil rahi he
 There is a need and a motorbike squad so that it can make a foolproof arrangement to deal with fire in the streets of Benaras
 bhartiya railway ko 'lifline of di nesan' kaha jaataa he
 But in the new financial year, there will be major changes in the rules of the lifeline of the country
 kuch badlaav aapaki jeb par kanchi chalaayenge to kuch aapako raahat pahunchaayenge
 Let's know about the major changes coming in Indian Railways
 1
 Separate seats will not be available on half tickets, till now, for children between 5 and 12 years, they used to get separate seats even after getting half tickets cut
 lekin 22 april se yah niyam khatm ho jayega
 Now this will not happen
 haalanki half tikat karavaaya ja sakegaa lekin iske liye alag se seat nahin milegi
 On one hand, with this step, the common man will have to spend more money for the journey, while the railways will be able to give confirmed tickets to 2 crore other passengers
 2
 The quota for senior citizens, pregnant women has increased the reservation quota for senior citizens and pregnant women on the train
 varisht nagarikon kaa kota 50 fisadi badhaayaa gaya he
 Now 80 to 90 seats will be reserved for the elderly in each train, while 6 lower berths have been reserved for pregnant women
 asi-2 or 3 main teen loar berth garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye arakshit hongi
 3

 4
 ek kol se karvaa sakenge tikat cansilayatri ab sirf139 par kol kar apni tikat cancilakarvaa sakenge
 For this, phone details will have to be given on 139
 iske baad paisanger ko van time password milegaa
 The passenger has to show this at the OTP railway ticket counter and he will get the money back
 haalanki jis din kii tikat hogi paise usee din tak rifund honge
 This facility is for those who have taken a counter ticket

 unhone kaha ki assam desh main prashasit sambhavat: sabase jatil rajya he kyonki yahaan vibhinn samudaayon ke log rahete hai
 The people of the country need to learn to live together because people from different communities live in India
 baharhaal unhone kaha ki rajya main avaidh pravaasiyon kii sankhya main kaaphi kami ai he or isaki seemaa bangladesh ke saath judi hui he
 Chidambaram, who is on a two-day visit to the state, said Assam's border is a difficult border

 He said that the government would have to construct border posts, and roads and build border security complex

 metro dilli waalon ke liye na sirf shaan kii sawari he, balki safar kaa aasaan or behatar saadhan bhi he
 That is why the congestion in the Delhi Metro continues to increase
 lekin metro ke musafiron ke saamne sabase badi samasya last mil connactivity kii hoti he
 That means the biggest problem is to reach the metro station from home or the office from the metro station
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ab dilli metro ne last mil connactivity ke liye nae i rickshaw launch kiye hai, jo aam i rickshaw se alag hai

 DMRC is currently running 291 feeder buses on 42 routes, but this is not enough to provide last mile connectivity to passengers
 isliye ab dmarsi kaa plan kiraaye par cycle dene or sankari galiyon ke liye i-rickshaw chalaane kaa he

 In the meeting of the Congress Working Committee, which lasted nearly four hours at the party headquarters, there has been talk of rethinking the organization
 vichaar hua ki aane vaale dinon main adhyaksh kaa kaarykaal paanch saal se teen saal kiya jaae
 However, no major change is visible in the policies of the Congress
 congress kaarysmiti kii baithak main rahul gandhi ko lekar kisi bade elaan kii ummid bhi galat sabit hui
 Senior general secretary of Congress Janardan Dwivedi said in clear terms after the meeting that there was no discussion on the issue
 haalanki sanghathan ke bheetar bhi congress kai badlaavon kii soch rahi he
 For this, she will also amend her constitution
 adhyaksh, mahasachiv or duusare santhnik ohadon kaa kaarykaal paanch saal se gata kar teen saal kiya ja saktaa he
 But it is clear that neither at the level of the organization, the Congress is moving away from the grip of sonia-rahul and neither is it thinking of anything new at the level of thought
 kaarysmiti main faisalaa hua ki party bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh kaa virodh karegi, adivaasiyon, daliton or pichhadon ke liye 50% aarakshan maangegi, bade paimaane par jan sampark abhiyaan chalaaegi or party ke alag-alag wing ke liye alag-alag sadsyta kii zarurat khatm karegi

 He has written tagging Sona Mahapatra that he is a black spot in the name of the woman
 rangoli yaheen nahin rukii, unhone ye bhi kaha ki sirf publicity paane ke liye aisi coment karnaa bekaar he

 Former India captain Rahul Dravid praised Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team for a resounding victory in the Champions Trophy, saying that the Indian team is balanced and the role of a superb fielding was instrumental in winning the title
 dravid ne kaha, bharat sarvshereshth team thi
 They did not come under pressure in a decisive position
 bharat kii ballebaaji, kohli or jadeja ke bich saajhedaari or aakhri overon main gendbaaji shandaar thi
 The Indian team was better in the final
 unhone kaha, bharat kii sabase badi khubi uskaa santulan he
 We are surprised by the situation in England
 gend ko kitni spin mili or isse bharat saat ballebaajon ke saath utar sakaa chunki jadeja ne saatven number par utar rahe the
 This was not the case earlier
 dravid ne bharat kii fielding kii bhi tarif kii
 He said, India did a great fielding
 kisi toornament main hameshaa yah kehane kaa mauka nahin miltaa ki bharat kii fielding sarvshereshth thi
 The energy on the field of the Indians was commendable
 unhone kaha, iskaa shrey chayankartaaon ko jaataa he
 Many times we forget him, but he did his work well
 kai logon ko laga hoga ki is team main anubhav kii kami he, lekin khilaadiyon ne chayankartaaon ko sahi sabit kar diya
 a title win in the Champions Trophy will boost India's confidence for the 2015 World Cup, but Dravid does not want to think that far ahead
 dravid ne kaha, bahut aage kii sochna khatarnaak he
 After India won the 2011 World Cup, who thought that after two years our team will have only three of them
 yah puri nai team he, lihaaja bahut aage kii sochna khatarnaak he

 Irfan is a bowler who can complete this shortfall by regaining his rhythm in one and a half years
 dravid ne kaha ki november main dakshin africa kaa daura bharat ke liye kathin chunauti hoga
 He said, it will be a different type of examination
 ranking main ham van-de main number van hai, lekin test main chauthe yaa paanchaven number par hai
 We are behind South Africa, so it will be a tough challenge
 khaskar agar del sten, morni morkal or vernon philander feet hue to
 Dravid said, India was the best team
 ve nirnaayak sthiti main dabaav main nahin aae
 India's batting, the partnership between Kohli and Jadeja and bowling in the last over was superb
 bhartiya team final main behatar thi
 He said, India's greatest quality is its balance
 england ke halaat se ham hairaan hai
 How much spin the ball got and that helped India get down with seven batsmen as Jadeja came down at number seven
 pehle aisa nahin tha
 Dravid also praised India's fielding
 unhone kaha, bharat ne shandaar fielding kii
 No tournament always has the chance to say that India's fielding was the best
 bharatiyon kii maidan par urja kaabile tarif thi
 He said, the credit goes to the selectors
 kai baar ham unhen bhul jate hai, lekin unhone apane kaam ko bakhubi anjaam diya
 Many may have felt that this team lacked experience, but the players proved the selectors right

 bharat ke 2011 vishwacap jeetne ke baad kisne sochaa tha ki do saal baad hamaari team main unamem se sirf teen khilaadi honge
 This is a whole new team, so it is dangerous to think ahead

 The comments unhone kaha, bharat ko ek tej gendbaaj harfanmaulaa kii jarurat he

 Dravid said visiting South Africa in November would be a tough challenge for India
 unhone kaha, yah alag tarah kii pariksha hogi
 We are number one in the ODI rankings, but are ranked fourth or fifth in Tests
 ham dakshin africa se peeche hai, lihaaja yah kathin chunauti hogi
 Especially if Dale Steyn, Morni Morkel and Vernon Philander fit

 The Delhi High Court has slammed the DDA and other agencies, including the NBCC, over the cutting of 16,500 trees in South Delhi and questioned where patients are not getting water outside the two big hospitals AIIMS and Safdarjung in the country

 is dauraan acting chif justise gita mittal or justise hari shankar kii bench itani naaraaz thi ki unhone saaf kaha ki agar jarurat padi to court enbisisi ke is pureproject par roklaga degaa

 philhal, hoicourt ne ped kaatane par 26 july tak roak laga di he
 And the court has ordered NBC, DDA, Central Government, Delhi Government to file a reply in detail on the project and cutting of trees
 hoicourt ne sabhi agenciyon ko fatkaar lagaate hue kaha ki 2 manjila building ko 8 manjila building main tabdeel karnaa reedeveopment nahin hota

 In the last few years, due to the continuous increase in the construction of Delhi NCR, the green cover is getting reduced, the concern of the High Court is that if trees continue to be cut down in the name of redemption, then it will not take much time for Delhi to become a desert
