 After Dominici was fired, Dream Theater successfully fought to free himself from the contract with the mechanic, after which he began auditioning singers and writing material for his next album
 In his search for a new singer, he auditioned over 200 people, among them Fates Warning's lead singer John Arch and all others were turned down

 To promote this, the label released a CD single and video clip for the song "another Day", but both showed no commercial impact
 The song "pull Me Under", however, received a fairly high level of radio broadcasts without any managed promotion from the band and the label
 pratikriya main, ATCO ne pul me under ke liye ek video clip banaai, jiskaa MTV par baari doharaav hua
 a third video clip was produced for "take the Time", but it was not as successful as "pull Me Under"

 At the end of the tour, the band decided to take Sherinian as Moore's permanent replacement
 ek baar phir khud ko ek nae sadsy ke saath paakar, dream theatre ne turant nai saamagree par kaam shuru nahin kiya
 Fans around the world merged onto the Etsyjam mailing list and began to pressure the band to officially release the song "A Change of Seasons"
 yah 1989 main likhaa gaya tha or ise imejez and vards kaa hissaa banaae jane kii baat thi, lekin lagbhag 17 minute kaa hone ke kaaran ise studio main prayog ke liye kaaphi lanbaa samajha gaya

 1997 ke madhya main, unhone apana aglaa album likhane ke liye studio main pravesh kiya
 In addition to pressuring the band to adopt a mainstream sound, Eastwest hired writer / producer Desmond Child to carve out the lyrics to Petrucci's "you and Me"

 However, Portnoy did not say anything publicly at the time, several years later, in a 2004 DVD commentary for 5 Years in a Livetime, stating that he was so frustrated during this period that he completely disbanded Dream Theater Had made up my mind to do it

 In 1999, he accepted Dream Theater's third offer to become a board player, replacing Sherinian
 ek nae sadsy ke saath, apane agle album ko likhane or record karne ke liye dream theatre ne ek baar phir boartreks studio main pravesh kiya
 As a result of Portnoy's ultimatum, the label gave the band complete creative control
 "metropolis part 1" kaa anuvarthi, jise fouling intu infinity ke satron ke dauraan likhaa gaya tha, us par dubaara kaam shuru kiya gaya
 He decided to expand that 20-minute song into a full concept album, which would have a story that would revolve around themes such as rebirth, murder and betrayal
 To avoid any kind of trouble from the fan base, the writing and recording process was kept completely confidential
 album ke jari hone se pehle jo baaten prashansakon ko pataa chal sakin vah thim, ek trek suchi jise band kii ichha ke khilaaf li kiya gaya tha or relies kii ek taarikh

 unhone seens from a memory album ko, shuru se lekar ant tak pesh kiya, jahaan manch ke peeche kii diwaar par ek video screen tha jo album kii kahani ko saath-saath pesh kar rahaa tha
 In addition to presenting the album in its entirety, the band also played a second set of Dream Theater songs, as well as playing some of Dream Theater's covers and some new forms of older material
 For an additional special show at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City, actors were hired to play the characters in the story and perform a part of the presentation, enlisting a church choir

 On 4 March 2010, it was announced that Dream Theater would support Iron Maiden as part of its summer tour of the US and Canada
 apana naam badalane ke liye majaboor hone ke baavjood, dream theatre ne ek custom logo apanaaya or vardemark jo unki tamaam prachaar samagriyon par or dream theatre ke har studio elbum ke aavaran par chapa hota he
 The Majesty symbol is derived from the Mary, Queen of Scots symbol, modified by Charlie Dominici for use on album artwork for When Dream and Day Unite
 yah capital Phi, ek capital Mu or ek capital lambda se bana he
 Throughout his career, the live performances of Dream Theater gradually became larger, longer and more diverse
 is kaa sabase spasht udhaaharan unki chakree set list niti he
 Which means that, every night of each tour, prepared by Portnoy, has its own set list, for which he adopts a complex process that ensures his uniqueness
 iske liye kai karkon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa tha, jaise pichley shaharon kii soochiyon kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa tha, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki jo log ek hi kshetra main dream theatre ko kai baar dekhte hai unhen ek gane ko dubaara na sunanaa pade or yahaan tak ki us set list par bhi dhyaan diya jaataa he jise kisi khaas shahar main band ne apane kaarykram ke dauraan apanaaya tha taaki band ke un prashansakon ko ekresata na lage jo sabhi dauron ko dekhte hai
 To make this possible, the band tries to make the most of its catalog in any of its performances, depending on what Portnoy has scheduled for the night
 is prakriya main ek jatil prakaash vyavastha kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti thi taaki vyaktigat geeton par aadhaarit purv-vinyast prakaash sanketon ko lod kiya ja sake
 Some notable partners on Dream Theater tours include Deep Purple, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Iron Maiden, Joe Satriani, Kings X, Marillion, Megadeth, In Flames, Pain of Salvation, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, Queensrice, Riverside, Spokes Beard, Fear Factory, Enchant, Symphony x and Yes In 2005, Dream Theater toured North America with the Gigantour Festival, where it performed with Megadeth

" kaha jaataa he, jisamen band ek madhyantar ke saath kam se kam teen ghante tak pradarshan karata he, jisamen koi aarambhik act nahin hota
 The program, which was recorded for Live Scenes from New York, was nearly four hours long and resulted in Portnoy being hospitalized due to the intake of toxic food before the program
 dream theatre ke kaarykram se hasya, anaupchaarik tarika or ashurachana kii kaaphi maatra judi hui he
 In the middle of "A Change of Seasons", it was very common to quote from topics such as Major League Baseball and the Simpsons, and Rudess regularly revises his and others' solo section in songs, often under the Liquid Tension Experience 2
 Se plays the ragtime section of "when the Water Breaks"
 vans in a livetime main shaamil adhikansh gaanon main anya logon ke snipats shaamil the jaise linyard skinyard kaa "free bird" or rimski-coursecove kaa "flit of da bombalbi"

 sabase haal ke "20th aneverseri world tour" main rudes ne yahaan tak ki "andles secrifis" ke dauraan ek choti "tvinkal, tvinkal, little star" theme bhi shaamil kii or israel main ek sangeet kaarykram ke dauraan usne ek swatahpravartit "hawa-nagila" shuru kiya jisamen baad main band ke baaki logon ne uskaa saath diya
 Occasionally, one of the viewers is randomly called to perform on stage, which can be seen during Portnoy's drum solo in the Live at Budokan DVD

 Perhaps the best example of Dream Theater's unpredictable program structure was during Derek Sherinian's time in the band
 chuninda kaaryakramon main band ke sabhi sadsy apane vaadyayantron kii adla-badali kar lete or ek kaalpanik band nikhmer cinema ke rup main doharaav kaa pradarshan karte
 ve aamtaur par deep purple ke "parfect stranger" ke cover kaa pradarshan karte or ek avasar par uzi osborn ke "suicide solution" kaa
 kuch kaaryakramon main, sherinean, petruki or portnoy "niki lemons and da migraine bros" ke naam ke tahat ek saath manch par aate the
 Sherinian, wearing a feather boa and novelty sunglasses, performed a pop-punk song "I Don't Like You" with the vocals of Portnoy and Petrucci
 caos in moshan tour main, "trial of tours" ke kai samaaroh pehle, portnoy or petruki apni jagah badal kar vaan hellen ke "irpshan" ko pesh karte the
 Dream Theater had 20,000 viewers on 6 December 2005 in Santiago, Chile as the main event presenter

 On the score DVD, during the song Octavarium, the band is shown performing in an octagonal shaped maze
 anemeshan ke aage badhane par jordan rudes, apneaap hi santa clos main badal jaataa he or jon petruki ko aag lag jaati he
 In "the Dark Eternal Night" from the Chaos in Motion DVD, the band members battle a monster by firing fireballs from their guitars, throwing drum sticks and screaming
 2008 main, dream theatre ne, opeth, bitwin da barid and me or 3 ke saath milakar "progressive nesan 08" tour shuru kiya
 The tour is the brainchild of Mike Portnoy, who said “I have wanted to collect such a package tour for many years
 un sabhi tyoharon or package tour ke saath jo america se guzarataa he, main apane prabandhak or agent se aaj se kareeb 10 saal pehle se kuch aisa karne kii baat karata rahaa hum jo hard rock or metal ke apekshaakrit adhik pragatisheel, sangeetkaar unmukh paksh par jor detaa ho
 maine tay kar liya, ki ab baaten band karne kaa samay he or qamar kasakar maidan main utar janaa chahie
" On 13 February 2009, Dream Theater announced the official presenters for its Progressive Nation 2009 tour
 is daure main mul rup se swedish band birdfish or pen of salveshan ke saath-saath zappa plaz zappa ko prastuti deni thi
 On June 22, 2009, Mike Portnoy announced that Pain of Salvation and Birdfish would not be present on the North American leg of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour due to record label complications
 usee ghoshnaa main, portnoy ne kaha ki scale da summit or bigelf band, tour main birdfish or pen of salveshan kii jagah lenge
 is parivartan ke kaaran, bigelf, progressive nesan 2009 ke uttar america or europea charnon main shaamil hua
 The North American phase of this round continued throughout July and August 2009
 26 march 2009 ko, yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki dream theatre, progressive nesan tour ko opeth, bigelf or anexpect ke saath pehali baar europe le jayega
 yah daura 2009 ke puure sitambar or oktober chalaa
aayran meden ke june 2010 ko shuru ho rahe daure ke liye, dream theatre shubharambh karegaa
 Mike Portnoy launched an official series of bootlegs in response to Dream Theater fans' relationship with live versions of their programs
 pragatisheel metal style main, dream theatre ek sakriy bootleg band he
 Since his debut in New York as Majesty, fans have recorded almost every Dream Theater show and some very extensive and professional recordings have been released
 haalanki, band kaa har sadsy, dream theatre ke bootleg ko jari karne ko pasand nahin karata he
 Portnoy is the most pro-bootleg member, since he has collected many bootlegs since his childhood and has his own personal collection of Dream Theaters in his basement
 petruki or labri ne logon dwaara apane sangeet kaarykram kii recording karne ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai he
 Petrucci does not like the bootleg because he wants the audience to focus on the musicians on stage and not on adjusting their recording equipment
 labrie, on the other hand, argues that bootlegging allows ownership and control of Dream Theater performances away from the band and into the hands of the public
 myung ne bootleging ke liye halke virodh kaa pradarshan kiya he, lekin kuch saakshatkaaron main usne ullekh kiya he ki vah iske liye vishesh rup se koi mudda nahin bananaa chahta
 Dream Theater has released an official series of bootlegs, demos and other rare scenes through etsyjam Records headed by Portnoy
 unamem aise demos shaamil hai jo aadhikarik album se pehle band dwaara baahar rakhe gaye, saath hi saath kai sajiv kaarykram, jinamein un kaaryakramon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he jisamen band ne kisi vishesh album ko prastut kiya
 Albums included include The Dark Side of the Moon, Made in Japan, Master of Puppets and Number of the Beast
 dream theatre ko apane puure karier main anya kalakaaron ke gaanon ko cover karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 He took the practice to a new level during the promotional tour of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence
 In three special events that took place in Barcelona, chicago and New York City, he performed Metallica's Master of Puppets album in full, followed by a full set of Dream Theater material
 yah prashansakon ke liye ek aashcharya tha, kyonki vahaan aisa kuch hone kaa koi sanket nahin tha, sirf itani ghoshnaa kii gai thi ki prayek shahar main do raaton ke kaarykram main kuch "atyant vishesh" hoga
 The background to this tradition can be traced to Mike Portnoy's favorite band Phish, who began presenting the "musical costumes" of the entire album from other artists, beginning in 1994, each Halloween
 portnoy ne kaarykram kii ek shrinkhalaa main pratham ke rup main is "album cover" ko taiyaar kiya jise un band ke prati shradhanjali ke rup main bajaanaa tha jo dream theatre ke nirmaan or vikaas main prabhaavshaalee rahe the
 The cover set divided many fans attending the event, with some saying that Dream Theater went to enjoy the original music at the event rather than listening to another artist's composition
 Others, however, said it was a bonus and not a replacement for a normal Dream Theater concert, as a simple show had been performed the night before
 daure ke agle charan par, unhone aayran meden ke da number of da bist ko shaamil kiya or master of papets ke liye bhi waisi hi pratikriya praapt hui, haalanki yah pehle se pataa tha ki ek cover ko us raat prastut kiya jayega kyonki kyonki us raat, daure ke kaarykram main ek hi shahar main do kaarykram lagaataar shaamil the

 13 janvari 2006 ko or 15 ko dream theatre ne deep purple ke sajiv album maid in japan ko cover kiya
 Portnoy has said that he has planned another cover show, but declined to say when it will take place and which album it will cover
 gigntur 2005 ke dauraan, dream theatre ne paintera ke "cymmetry gates" ko "dimbag" derel lans abt ko shradhanjali dene ke rup main cover kiya

 Due to these reasons, this Mahakalp is considered to be the beginning of a new Mahakalpa in rock-level-science

 There are three kalpas under this Mahakalpa, which are called Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous

 The Indian Navy has training institutes at Cochin, Lonavla, and Jamnagar
 open source intelligence, and intended to serve as a source of continuing education on naval and military affairs Autism is a disorder occurring during brain development that affects a person's social behavior and interaction
 hindi main ise 'aatmavimoh' or 'svaparayanata' bhi kehete hai
 The affected person behaves in a limited and repetitive manner, such as repeating the same task over and over
 yah sab bachche ke teen saal hone se pehle hi shuru ho jaataa he
 a set of these symptoms differentiates narcissism from mild narcotic spectrum disorder, such as Asperger's syndrome
 otism ek maansik rog he jiske lakshan janm se hi yaa baalyavastha se nazar aane lagaten hai
 The development of children who have this disease is unusual compared to other children
 otism hone ke koi ek kaaran nahin khoja ja sakaa he
 According to the recommendations, there can be many reasons for autism such as- aatmavimoh kaa ek majboot anuvanshik aadhaar hota he, haalanki aatmavimoh kii anuvanshiki jatil he or yah spasht nahin he ki ASD kaa kaaran bahujine samvaad he yaa durlabh utparivartan 
 In rare cases, narcissism has also been linked to factors that are responsible for birth defects
 anya prastaavit kaarnon me, bachapan ke tike, vivaadaaspad hai or iske koi vaigyanik saboot bhi nahin he
 According to a recent review, two cases per 1000 people are self-reported, while the number is close to 6 / 1000 for ASD
 ausatan ASD kaa purush:mahila anupaat 4,3:1 he
 Cases of narcissism have increased dramatically since 1980, one of the reasons being the growth in the field of medical diagnosis, but whether these cases have actually increased is an unanswered question
 aatmavimoh mastishk ke kai bhaagon ko prabhavit karata he, par iske kaarnon ko dhang se nahin samajha jaataa
 Parents usually recognize its symptoms in the first two years of their child's life
 shuruaati sangyanatmak yaa vyavhaari hastkshep, bacchon ko swayan kii dekhbhaal, saamaajik or baatcheet kaushal ke vikaas main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 There is no cure for it
 bahut kam aatistic bachche hi vayask hone par aatmanirbhar hone main safal ho pate hai
 Nowadays, a self-imposed culture has developed, in which some people believe in treatment and for some people self-immolation is a condition rather than a disorder
 aatmavimoh ko ek lakshan ke bajaay ek vishisht lakshanon ke samooh dwaara behatar samajha ja saktaa he
 Key symptoms include inability to social interaction, inability to communicate, limited hobbies, and repetitive behavior
 anya pahaluon me, jaise khaane kaa ajeeb tarika haalaanki aam he lekin nidaan ke liye aavashyak nahin he
 Social development In addition to being incapable of self-immolation, humans are unable to understand the intentions of other people, so people often do not take them seriously
 saamaajik asamarthataayen bachapan se shuru ho kar vyask hone tak chalati hai
