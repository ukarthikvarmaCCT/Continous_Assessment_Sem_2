 yah prayek 75 se 76 varsh ke antaraal main prithvi se najar aata he
 Heli is the only short-term comet that can be seen clearly with the naked eye from Earth and is the only comet seen with the naked eye that appears twice in human life
 nagn aankhon se dikhaai dene vaale anya dhoomaketu chamakdaar or adhik darshneey ho sakate he lekin vah hajaaron varshon main keval ek baar dikhaai dete he
 Halley returned to the inner solar system by its astronomers in 240 BC
 Observations and records have been recorded since
 is dhoomaketu ke dikhne ke spasht record chini, babylonian or madhyakaalin europea shaskaon dwaara darj kiye gaye the parantu us samay ise aavarti dhoomaketu ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa ja sakaa tha
 It was first identified by the British astronomer Edmund Halley in 1705 as a recurring comet and was later named Halley comet after him
 heley dhoomaketu bhitari soramandal main aakhri baar san 1986 main dikhaai diya tha or yah agali baar san 2061 ke madhya main dikhaai degaa
 Upon its entry in 1986, Halley became the first comet to be studied closely and in detail by a spacecraft
 isane heley kii naabhi kii sanrachana tathaa coma or poonch ke gathan ke tantra kaa sabase pehla avlokan data uplabdh karaayaa
 This observation provided the basis for long-standing concepts about the composition of comets, particularly Fred Whipple's 'dirty Snow Ball' model
 unhone heley kii sanrachana kaa sahi anumaan lagaaya tha ki yah asthir padaarthon ke mishran se bana he jaise ki - pani, carbon dioxide, ammonia or dhul
 The data provided by this mission has greatly improved our views about Heli
 udhaaharan ke liye hamen ab yah samaj main aa rahaa he ki heley kii sataha mote taur par dhul or gaiyr vashpashil padaarthon se bani he tathaa uskaa maatr chota sa hissaa hi barf yaa asthir padaarth se bana hua he
 Halley is the first comet that was recognized as a recurring comet
 dhoomaketu kii prakruti par arestu kii dharna kii tatkaaleen darshanikon main aam sahmati thi ki dhoomaketu prithvi ke vayumandal main gadabadi kaa nateeja he
 This idea of aristotle was proved wrong in 1577 by Tycho Brahe
 tiko ne lamban maapan kaa istemaal kar dikhaaya ki dhoomaketu kaa astitv chandramaa se bhi pare he
 Many people still disagreed that comets actually orbited the Sun and believed that dhumketu followed a straight path and passed through the solar system
 san 1687 main sar ijac newton ne apni ' princepia ' prakashit kii, jisamen unhone gurutv or gati ke apane niyamon ko rekhaankit kiya
 His work on comets was certainly incomplete though he suspected that the first sighting in 1680 and 1681 and the dhumketu which appeared after the Sun passed through were the same
 unki yah dharna baad main sahi paayi gai thi
 He was completely unable to reconcile the comets in his model
 aakhirkaar newton ke mitra, sampadak or prakaashak edmund heley ne san 1705 main apni 'synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, ' main dhoomaketu kii kakshaon par brihaspati or shani ke gurutvkarshan prabhaav kii gananaa ke liye newton ke nae niyamon kaa upyog kiya
 This calculation enabled him to examine the historical records and determine orbital elements
 unhone paaya ki san 1682 main dikhaai dene vaala doosraa dhumaketu kareeb-kareeb vahin do dhumaketu he jo aaj se pehle san 1531 or san 1607 main dikhaai die the
 Thus Hailey concluded that the three Dhumketu are in fact the same, returning every 76 years
 is avadhi ko baad main sanshodhit kar prayek 75-76 varsh kar diya gaya
 Considering the gravitational effects of planets falling on comets, it was predicted after a rough estimate that Halley would return again in 1758
 heley dhoomaketu vaapasi kii bhavishyavaanee sahi sabit hui
 It was spotted on 25 December 1758 by a German farmer and amateur astronomer Johann Georg Pelsijk
 khud heley apane jeevankaal main is dhoomaketu kii vaapasi nahin dekh paae the kyonki san 1742 main unki mrityu ho gai
thi
 Confirmation of this dhumketu return showed for the first time that bodies other than planets exist which revolve around the Sun
 yah vaapasi purv neutonian bhautikee kaa ek safal pareekshan tha or saath hi uski vyaakhyaatmak shakti kaa ek spasht pradarshan bhi tha
 This dhumketu was named in 1759 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de lasalle in honor of Hailey
 heley kii kakshiya avadhi pichhali teen shatabdiyon se 75 or 76 varsh ke bich rahi he
 Although 240 BC Since its orbital period has varied between 74 and 79 years

967 vikendrata ke saath atyadhik andakar he
 Hailey is classified as a recurring or short-duration comet with an orbital period of 200 years or less
 iske vipareet deergh-avadhi dhoomaketu apni parikrama hajaaron varshon main puri karte he
 The average tilt from the ecliptic of the rotating comets is only 10 degrees and its average orbital period is just 6
5 years
 is prakaar heley kii kaksha kuch apraroopik he
 The shortest period comet whose orbital period is less than 20 years and tilt from ecliptic is 20-30 degree or less is called 'jupiter family comet'
 heley ke jaise wein aavarti dhoomaketu jinaki kakshiya avadhi 20 or 200 varsh ke bich he or jinke krantivrutt se jhukaav kaa vistaar 0 degree se 90 degree yaa usase adhik he ' heley- tip dhoomaketu ' kehalaate he
 Of the nearly 400 Jupiter family comets identified to date, only 54 heli-type comets can be observed
 heley -prakaar dhoomaketuon kii kakshaon ko dekhakar lagata he ki wein multah dirdh -avadhi dhoomaketu the jinaki kakshaon ko vishaal grahon ke gurutvkarshan ke dwaara prabhavit kiya gaya or saath hi aatanrik saura mandal main unhen nirdeshit kiya gaya
 If Halley was ever a long-term comet, it is likely that it originated in the Oort cloud, a massive sphere of comet bodies whose inner edge is 20,000–50,000 astronomical units away from the Sun
 iske vipareet brihaspati parivaar dhoomaketuon kii utpatti kuiper belt main maani jaati he jo barfile malbe kii ek sapaat chakti he jo surya se 30 khagoleey ekak or 50 khagoleey ekak ke bich sthit he
 In 2008 another new point for the origin of Heli-type comets was proposed the trans-neptunian object whose orbit extends from the outer part of Uranus to twice the distance to Pluto
 ho saktaa he yah soramandal ke chote nikaayon kii ek nayi aabaadi kaa ek sadsy ho jon heley-prakaar dhoomaketuon ke strot ke rup main kaary karata he

 Ghasiram Kotwal is a Marathi play written by Vijay Tendulkar
 yah brahmanon ke garh puna main rojgaar kii talash main gaye ek hindi bhashi brahman ghasiram ke traasadee kii kahani he
 Humiliated by the Brahmins, Ghasiram deals with his daughter's marriage to the Maratha Peshwa Nana Phadnabis and seeks revenge on the Brahmins by acquiring Poona's Kotwali
 kintu naanaa uski beti kii hatya kar detaa he
 Ghasiram cannot take revenge even after wanting it
 ulte naanaa uski hatya karvaa detaa he
 The original Marathi form of the play was first performed on 16 December 1972 in Poona by the Progressive Dramatic Association at the Bharat Natya Mandir
 nirdeshak the dow jabbaar patel
 'ghasiram Kotwal' is not a historical drama
 vah ek naatak he, sirf naatak !naatak sirf naatak hi hota he
 To say in the context of a literary work that it is historical, or mythological, or social, is meaningless
 samay bahut jaldi saamaajik ko aitihaasik or aitihaasik ko puranic bana detaa he
 Yet the content of this play — raw masala — is chronologically chronologically
 itihaas kaa ksheen-sa aadhaar avashya liya gaya he
 However, the drama has nothing to do with history beyond this
 or yah kaccha masala bhi thik usee tarah itihaas se liya gaya he, jis tarah samasamyik jivan-sthitiyon se bhi liya jaataa he
 Maharashtra was ruled by the Peshwas, Nana Phadnavis was the head of the Peshwa, one was a Ghasiram, a Brahmin, a Maratha chieftain, and all those units in their respective circles, like a wooden stick in the flow of time, sometimes moved away, sometimes
 Sometimes touching each other, sometimes colliding, the untimely flow was flowing
 unka yah kaary-karan uchit tha yaa anuchit yaa unka moolbhoot astitv sarthakatayukta tha athwa nahin, isaki khojbin karnaa itihaas kaa shodh karanevaale vyakti kaa kaam ho saktaa he, naatakkaar kaa nahin
 For this reason, i consider 'ghasiram Kotwal' as an historical drama
 ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ ek kinvadanti, ek janashruti ek dantakatha he
 And the legend has its own structure: when we rekindle our reality with the help of imagination, it becomes a legend
 dantakatha gapp bhi he or dekhne kii drushti ho to ek daahak anubhav bhi
 There is no doubt in this that only the creative experience becomes creative literature
 parantu dantakatha kya hoti he or kisi hoti he, isse zyada mahatva kii baat yah he ki ham use kis tarah lete hai, kyonki tabhi ham apni jaanch-padtaal karte hai
 Obviously this is the most difficult task, that is a deep challenge
 use swikaarna apni sahitya-nishtha kaa parichay dena he
 In my view, 'ghasiram Kotwal' indicates a specific social situation
 vah samaaj-sthiti na puraani he or na nai
 Neither is it tied to any geographical boundary, nor from time itself
 vah sthal-kalathit he, isliye ‘ghasiram’ or ‘naanaa fadanvis’ bhi sthal-kalathit hai
 Societies give birth to them, they will continue to give
 kisi bhi yug kaa naatakkaar unase achoota nahin rah paaegaa
 According to his nature, he will sometimes give a grand and gruesome look to the stage, sometimes he will make a dance-musical and present it
 maine jaan-boojhkar duusari reeti apanaai he
 The flexibility of folklore is noted and most useful for the presentation of the legend
 usamen ek paatr vishisht manovriti kaa pratinidhi banakar ubharta he or vah manovriti ekadam pratyaksh tathaa paripurna or amishrit hoti he
 In spite of the superficiality, she remains equally exposed to the general audience
 iske atirikt uskaa apana ek bhadesapan bhi hota he jo bhashaa or tamaasha ke staron par swayamev avateern hota he
 Why would i leave out this peculiarity of Loknatya? lekin rachanaakaar ko apni rachana ke vishay main zyada nahin bolnaa chahie, rachana swayan bolti he or vahi satya he
 Vijay Tendulkar is naatak main ghasiram or naanaa fadanvis kaa vyakti-sangharsh pramukh hote hue bhi tendulkar ne is sangharsh ke saath-saath apni vishisht style main tatkaaleen saamaajik evam rajnatik sthiti kaa maarmik chithran kiya he
 As a result, the difference of time-settlement on the entire state of the ruling class and the general public does not make much of a real difference
 ghasiram har kaal or samaaj main hote hai or har us kaal or us samaaj main use vaisaa banaanevaale or banaakar mauka taak uski hatya karanevaale naanaa fadanvis bhi hote hi hai-vah baat tendulkar ne apane dhang se pratipaadit kii he
 Nana has used Ghasiram very cunningly
 par jab unka rachaa ‘rakshas’ palatakar unheen ko chunauti dene lagata he to naanaa hi use nasht bhi kar detaa he
 From this point of view, this drama is of Nana Fadnavis, no doubt
 ghasiram ek prakaar se ek prasang maatr he jise tendulkar ne apane vaktavy kii abhivyakti kaa ek nimitt, ek saadhan banaaya he
 The portrayal of Nana Fadnavis and the then decadent society in the drama 'ghasiram Kotwal' has to reveal some truth to Tendulkar about the political and special social conditions which have become eternal
 itihaas ke naanaa fadanvis bauddhik prakharata se tadapati hui shakti ke rup main pratishthit hai
 But in this drama, only Ghasiram Kotwal is surrounded by the limits of his personality, his personality is seen as one, his other dimensions are not revealed
 apratyaksh rup se tendulkar ne iskaa bhi usee tarah upyog kiya he jaisaa lok naatakon main hota he jahaan charitra aamtaur par ek yaa do ayamavaale hi hote hai
 That is why a famous Marathi critic has described the play as being very traditional Indian drama-form epithet
 maine apni prastuti main isi baat ko kendriya sutara ke rup main mana he
 While watching the play, it should be unconsciously descending in the minds of the audience that the whole society is collapsing, it is getting lost
 yah baat apratyaksh nahin honi chahie
 As the composition of this play was completely new to Marathi theater, i was very happy to express its intended meaning in the desired indirect way
 kisi pratishthit naatakkaar ne lokanaty ke swaroop main koi naatak pehle dhaala nahin tha, isliye main lokanataka ke lacheele lochapurna shilpatantra kaa upyog kai prakaar se khulkar kar sakaa
 The imagery of the men’s swinging curtains is wonderful for the theater
 is naatak kii sabase badi yukti bhi yahi he
 Twelve Brahmins handle the narrative as a chorus
 aavashyaktaanusaar taatkaalik ikhari bhoomikaaye bhi nibhaate hai
 This curtain divides into two sections and in a moment, is transformed into many components of society, units
 ghasiram ko kotwaal ke rup main sthapit karanevaala yahi paradaa ghasiram ke vadh ke samay rusht brahmanon ke rup main rangamanch par dikhta he
 The same screen which is sung by Shri Gajraj Nartan, connects his relationship with Lokanatya through ganapati-vandana
 kalakaar or bhoomika ke bich ek sookshm or tar sambandh lokanaty kii visheshta he
 i did not tie my performance to any particular folk style but have mixed use of pure Marathi folk arts like Dashavatar, Bharuad, Khela, Tamasha, Powada, Wadhyamurali, Kirtan etc
 saraswati, lakshmi, ganpati dwaara dashavathari armbh hota he
 i have tried to show the equanimity in these different styles by using the Thal of Aarti of this time only for black vaccines during Kirtan
 brahman-veshdhari kalakaar prekshagrih se hokar rangamanch par aate hai
 In this way, the folklore form of performance becomes more and more communicated to the mental level of the audience due to the intimacy arising
 naatak ke pehle ank kii gati duusare ank kii apeksha dhimi he
 It is only natural to take time to establish a historical person in the external form of folk theater because it is an entirely new experience
 naanaa fadanvis sareekhe itihaas-purush kaa rangamanch par nrity-talbaddh hokar aana marathi darshak ke liye nishchay hi dhakka pahunchaanevaala anubhav tha
 Therefore, the viewer had to be convinced that the character of this play, Nana Phadnavis, is merely a folk character - not the authentic, complete personality of the historical plays
 kuch samikshakon kii drushti main yah baat bahut dhime-dhime sthapit hui
 But i felt that the direction of Ghansiram's use of Nana to get the place of Nana in it and to get the cotwali in it by directing the hollow society, etc
 should have been very detailed
 duusare ank kii gati tej thi
 Ghasiram, the oppressor of Poona's Brahmins, his vengeance, the transformation of Ghasiram into a demon due to that vengeance, etc
 is established by going to the scene of fire test
 naanaa ke vivaah se lekar gauri kii mrityu tak ghasiram bahut baichaiyn he lekin uski bechaini naradham kii he
 He did not want to slay the Brahmins in the cell, but the murder of Naradham Ghasiram is the result of his indirect crime - this contradiction of destiny has been effectively depicted by Tendulkar
 niyati kaa aisa pratishodh anek aitihaasik khalnaayakon ke prasang main miltaa he
 After Ghasiram's assassination, Nana's clever speech is full of levity and diplomacy, producing a unique impression of his dominance and Nana Fadnavis is again at the center of the play
 is naatak kaa angrej paatr ek darshak maatr he
 At the end of the play, he is standing in the lighthouse to the left at the rear post
 neeche ghasiram kii hatya ke baad samuhik utsav ho rahaa he
 This is the premonition of upcoming history of Poona
 yahi angrej ghasiram ke kotwali praapt karne ke samaaroh ke samay bhi ek kone main khadaa hokar uskaa sakshi banataa he
 When i first read this play, it seemed that the play is not visual-oriented, but rather visual-oriented
 mujhe aise hi drishy-bimbon dwaara prabhaav utpann karanevaale naatak kii talash thi
 Secondly, it was in my mind for a long time that the special effect that is produced in the films from three to four distances of distant intermediate and proximal pictures and the craft and tact of their blending should not be on theater as well? This drama proceeds from the sum of many segments like dialogue, dance, music, motion, characters, scenes etc
 in sabko jodanevaala sutara bhi jabardast he
 With all these elements, the play seems to be 'complete', so i tried to make it come true with the imaginary camera in hand
 prakaash-yojana dwaara rangamanch ko vibhajit kar dur or paas ke anek vaanchit prabhaav rangamanch par utpann kiye
 i set the pace and grouping etc
 in paper preparation only
 meri paddati main naatak kii pradarshan-prati ke har prishth par prasang ke rekhachitr pehle se taiyaar rahete hai
 Sixty-sixty-five characters of this drama did not automatically vibrate, but they were fully prepared for this
 in paatro kii gati-style kathputliyon kii tarah apekshit thi
 Ghasiram, which i chose in terms of character, was small in stature
 aasapaas ke ‘prachand’ vyaktiyon main vah bouna hi laganaa bhi chahie tha
 The dance movements were simple and easy but rhythmic
 shastreey nrity kaa prayog is lokanaty main jatil or atiprishkrut laga
 It was necessary to have the unrestrained energy of folk dance in the dance movements
 ghasiram kii nritymay mrityu-maatr ko hi swat: sfoort dhang se prastut kiya gaya
 The strong rhythm of the drum and the drum was further enhanced by Chandavarkarji 1, which increased the intensity of the scene
 naanaa kii nrity-gatiyon main sanyam or prabhutaa kaa put barkaraar tha
 Mulagandji 2 had molded Lavani into a sitting of Lavani, who was a full-fledged Marathi Rangwali

 Only the sundari instrument was an exception there
 naanaa-gauri ke baag ke drishy main or naanaa ke vivaah ke samay sundari alag-alag dhang se bajaai gayi thi
 Chandavarkar ji did not want the organ because the effect of popular music plays would have come in folk music
 naman, laavni, powada, vaadhyamurali, bharud aadi apane prakrut angadh oj ke saath hi gaae gaye
 Chanting was used for the first time on Marathi theater by Chandavarkar
 manushyon ke hilte parade kii gunagunaahat dwaara bhinn-bhinn bhavaveg vyakt kiye gaye
 After the murder of Ghasiram, there is celebration and then the curtain of human beings comes to the fore
 katha samaapt ho chuki he, isliye naanaa kii bhoomika karanevaala abhinayta bhi is parade main sammilit ho jaataa he
 Ghasiram is lying dead, but the actor does not get upset due to the rise, so he is allowed to remain in the same place as an exception
 tabhi sutaradhar aage badhkar shri gajraj nartan karain dhrupad ko bhairavi ke karun swar main gaakar us ‘kalakaar’ ko shrridhanjali arpit karata he

 However, this new rule was ruled in federal court that it was beyond the statutory authority of the FDA

 chunki prithvi kii sataha ek saamaan yaa samtal nahin he, atah avashoshit urja kii maatra bhi sthaan va samay ke anusaar bhinn bhinn hoti he
 This results in variations in temperature, density, and pressure - which then generate forces that force air to flow from one place to another

 These can be planted in one place, as a group or scattered over the entire country
 inamen rakrakhaav kii kam aavashyaktaa hoti haih- Since these wind-powered plants are simple and easy to operate, they require less maintenance as compared to other alternatives
 pawan urja kam kharchili haih- Since air is available without value, there is no risk of inflation with increase in fuel prices
 is prakaar pawan urja dhan tathaa eendhan donon hi roopon main bachat karti he
 Hence wind power is cost effective
 aaj vishwa ke kai kshetron main, jahaan vaayu ke strot kendrit he, vahaan pawan urja tel chaalit tathaa nabhakeey-shakti se utpaadit vidyut ko kadi chunauti de rahi he, kyonki paramparaagat urja sroton ke vikaas kii laagat jahaan din-pratidin bad rahi he, vahin pawan urja kii laagat tivrata se gir rahi he
 The increasing reliability of wind powered turbines is proving that in the near future, more and more regions will adopt wind energy as the least cost-effective alternative to other forms of energy
 pawan chaalit sanyantr mahange he or keval vahiin lagaae ja sakate he jahaan aavashyaktanuroop vaayu uplabdh ho
 Areas with high wind speeds may be inaccessible or may be located away from transmission lines with high volt capacity, which can cause problems in the transmission of wind energy

 Therefore, the practical inconvenience of wind energy due to non-availability of the same quantity continuously and unreliable supply has limited its use to areas where either no continuous supply of electricity is required, or a required supply Other sustainable energy options are available
 vidyut urja kaa bhandaaran kathin evam mahanga bhi he, isliye pawan urja kaa upyog kisi anya prakaar kii urja ke saath saath athwa gaiyr-vaidyut bhandaaran ke saath kiya ja saktaa he
 It is more advantageous to use wind energy with hydroelectric power generators, as water can be used as a source of energy storage and storage of underground compressed air is another option

 This interference may decrease as the distance from the plants increases, yet it may also affect trans-high frequency channels at distances of several kilometers
 agar blade sthir bhi ho to bhi vaayu main prasaarit sanket ' chhadam bimb ' utpann kar sakate he
 This problem can be overcome by changing the 'line of sight' between proper site-selection and micro-wave contact and putting the plants away from the broadcasting centers
 shor -- In many developed countries, the problem of 'noise' is presented as a weapon against wind energy development

 Furigana Furigana is a Japanese reading assistant in which the younger Kana is printed near Kanji to indicate his pronunciation
 yah ek tarah kaa rubi paath he
 Furigana is also called Yomigana or Ruby ル ビ) in Japanese
 aadhunik japani main ise aam taur par durlabh kanji yaa durlabh, amanak pathan dikhaane ke liye yaa bacchon or vidhyaarthiyon ke kitabon main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It was more prevalent before World War II
 furiganaa ko aam taur par hiraagaana main likhaa jaataa he, lekin kuch maamalon main katakana kaa bhi upyog hota he
 In vertical writing, the furigana is placed to the left of the letters, whereas in horizontal writing it is placed above the letters
 furiganaa ko ek akshar ke liye likhaa ja saktaa he, jisamen furiganaa ko us akshar par kendrit hote hai
 When this is done on one word, the entire Furigana word is centered on all those Kanji letters, even though not every Kanji has the same part in that Furigana word
 aisa tab hota he jab us japani shabd kaa vishesh uccharan hota he jiskaa us shabd ke kanji ke pathan se koi sambandh nahin he
 The design of the Furigana font is such that two Kana characters can sit on one Kanji
 yadi usase adhik kaana chahie, to sankshipt font yaa rikti badali jaati he 
 In case an isolated kanji character has a long reading — for example 〜 に 携 わ る —the furigana may instead spill over into the space next to the neighboring kana characters, without condensing or changing spacing
 Three-kana readings are not uncommon, particularly due to yōon with a long vowel, such as ryō; five kana are required for kokorozashi and six for uketamawaru, the longest of any characters in the Joyo kanji
 Very long readings also occur for certain kanji or symbols which have a gairaigo reading; the word "centimeter" is generally written as "cm" and has the seven-kana reading セ ン チ メ ー ト ル; Another common example is "%", which has the five kana reading パ ー セ ン ト
 These cause severe spacing problems due to length and these words being used as units
 jab sthaneey japani kunyomi or chini onyomi uccharanon main antar dikhaanaa zaruri he, jaise japanese shabdkoshon main, tab japani uccharanon ko hiraagaana or chini uccharanon ko katakana main likhaa jaataa he
 But this distinction is required only in dictionaries and reference subjects
 aam likhaai main hiraagaana kaa upyog hota he
 An exception to this is the names of modern Chinese places, individuals, and food - they are written in Kanji and Katakana is used in Furigana; And in informal writing it is often written only in Katakana
 aisa kabhi-kabhi duusare bhashaaon ke shabdon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he - 角獣 ke upar ユニコーン likhaa gaya hoga, japani main unicorn shabd ke uccharan ko dikhaane ke liye
 But katakana is generally used here
 furiganaa kaa upyog aam taur par bacchon ke kitabon main hota he, jinase sabhi kanji samajhane kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati, par hiraagaana main uccharan dikhaane se ve shabd ko samaj sakenge
 Because hiragana is taught to children first, hiragana furigana occurs on katakana in the books of very young children
 saath hi in kitabon main har kanji par furiganaa di jaati he
 It is called Sorubi in Japanese
 bacchon ke maanga or shonen maanga furiganaa kaa istemaal karte hai
 Many books have pronunciation aids
 yah suvidha kuch websiton par bhi uplabdh he
 They are popular with people who are learning Japanese and want to read Japanese stories, novels and articles
 vayask japani bhashiyon ke liye paathon main furiganaa kaa istemaal hota he durlabh kanji ko dikhaane ke liye; prasaaran sevaaon main aisa gair-joyo kanji ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Furigana is often shown with Kanji and English names of railway stations
 maanchitron par atapate naamon ke uccharan ko dikhaane ke liye bhi furiganaa kaa upyog hota he
 Without Furigana, youth would have been virtually illiterate before World War II
 Furigana Name japani naam aam taur par kanji main likhe jate hai
 Because a Kanji can have many readings, Furigana often shows the name reading
 japani aupchaarik patron main naam likhane ke sthaan ke paas furiganaa main naam likhane kii jagah hoti he
 Katakana is expected
 kanji main likhe videshi naamon main bhi furiganaa kaa upyog hota he
 Especially in Chinese and Korean names: Chinese names are pronounced according to Japanese recitation and recitation is given in Hiragana, while Korean names are pronounced according to Korean recitation and pronounced in Katakana
 kanji or kanji yagic shabdon ko japani shikshan kitabon main furiganaa ke saath diya jaataa he
 In the same way, in the books of learning foreign languages, words are pronounced in furigana
 jaise, korian bhashaa kii kitaab main hangul lipi main shabd par furiganaa se uccharan dikhaaya jaataa he
 According to the Japanese Ministry of Education guidelines, Japanese furigana should not be used in English education, given the differences in Japanese and English pronunciation
 udhaaharan ke liye, "birthdate" ko japani main バースデイト likhaa jayega, jiskaa uccharan he "basudeito"
 Okurigana are those kanas that come after the Kanji root in words, to complete an adjective or verb and to show disorder
 is tarah ve adhik pathan vaale kanji ke vahi uccharan ko bhi dikhaa sakate hai
 Examples: 上 が る and 上 る
 furiganaa ke vipareet okuriganaa ko likhnaa anivaary he
 Japanese style of literary Chinese letters is pronounced in a writing style called Kanbun
 isamen kunten naamak chihnon kaa upyog hota he
 Unlike Furigana, Kunten shows Japanese grammar parts that are not written in Kanbun and how to bring words into the Japanese dictionary
 furiganaa kaa upyog shabdon kaa arth dikhaane ke liye bhi hota he
 On foreign words kana or kanji the meaning of that word can be shown in Japanese, which is equivalent to its translation
 19veen or 20veen sadi main lekhak aksar videshi shabdon ko katakana main likhakar furiganaa kanji main unke arth dikhaate the
 This usage is called Furikanji in Japanese, as Furigana suggests the use of kana

 It is in this rationalization that there will be a federation of independent nations that will encourage a peaceful society globally, thus leading to a sustained peace among international communities
