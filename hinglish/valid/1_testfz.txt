 The small village of Nauti, the original home of the Rajguru Nautiyals of Garhwal's royal family, is famous for the tough Nand Raj Jat Yatra, which is held once in 12 years and is considered as important as the Kumbh Mela
 yah yatra nanda devi ko samarpit he jo gadhwal evam kumaun kii isht devi hai
 Nanda Devi is considered as another form of Parvati, which has a special place in the heart of the people of Uttaranchal, which inspires unmatched devotion and affection

 The Raj Jat is organized every 12 years, the entire preparation of which is done by the descendants of the original participants of this custom, the Nautiyals of Nauti and the Kunwar of Kansua village
 kunwar raaj parivaar ke vanshaj hai
 When Ajay Pal made Srinagar his capital, he entrusted the responsibility of organizing the Nand Raj Jat to the Kunwar
 yah mana jaataa he ki ajay paal ne hi har 12 varshon main raaj jat yojit karne kii pratha chalaayi
 This practice has been going on ever since

 Any additional arrangement that is made to maintain the output or phase variables of a system is called the control system
 jis mul tantra ke output ko niyantrit karnaa hota he, use sanyantr yaa niyantrit tantra kehete hai
 The control system constantly monitors the output or state variables of the plant and changes the output of the plant in such a way that the output remains the same or changes as desired

 The Sopani control system consists of more than one loop
 isamen niyantran char ke niyantran ke liye na keval ise hi mapa jaataa he balki kisi anya char ko bhi mapa jaataa he
 The outer loop, instead of directly controlling the control variable, provides a set-point for the inner loop that ultimately controls the primary variable through the process
 sopani niyantran chunane kaa mukhya kaaran yah hota he ki isse niyantran karne main kathin tantra do bhaagon main bant jaataa he or mukhya disterbens ko gherte hue ek dwitiyak niyantran loop bana diya jaataa he
 Thus the secondary loop removes most of the disturbances, so the main loop has to control only the small disturbances
 'sheeghra soochna safalataa kaa aadhaar he' - yahi sopani niyantran kaa bhi aadhaar he
 Sopani control is most beneficial where the inner closed loop covers all the disturbances and delays of the second order so that only the 'big lag' is included in the primary loop

 'great Life Giver'
 ahura majadaa koi vyakti nahin he, balki satv he, shakti he, urja he
 According to Zarathustra, there is a constant struggle between two primordial souls in the world
 inamen ek he ahura majadaa kii aatma, 'spenta manu'
 The second is the evil spirit 'anghara Menu'
 is dusht aatma ke naash hetu hi ahura majadaa ne apni saat kritiyon yatha akaash, jal, prithvi, vanaspati, pashu, maanav evam agni se is bhautik vishwa kaa srijan kiya
 They knew that due to their destructive nature and ignorance, the Anghara menu would attack this world and would enter into chaos, untruth, sorrow, cruelty, sickness and death
 manushya, jo ki ahura majadaa kii sarvshereshth kriti he, kii is sangharsh main kendriya bhoomika he
 He has to voluntarily take on the evil spirit in this struggle
 is yuddh main uske astr honge achchhai, satya, shakti, bhakthi, adarsh evam amartv
 By following these principles, humans will eventually end all the evil in the world
 kuch adhik vaigyanik kasuti par dharm ko parakhane vaale 'spenta manu' kii vyakhya alag tarah se karte hai
 According to it, the 'spenta menu' is not a soul, but an incremental, progressive mind or mindset
 arthath yah ahura majadaa kaa ek gun he, vah gun jo brahmand kaa nirmaan evam sanvardhan karata he
 God created the spenta menu so that a happy world could be created
 pragatisheel maansikta hi prithvi par manushyon ko do virgon main baantati he
 The virtuous, who promote the world and the vicious, who stop its progress
 zarathustra chaahate hai ki prayek vyakti ishwar tulya bane, jeevandaayee urja ko apanaae tathaa nirmaan, sanvardhan evam pragati kaa vaahak bane
 According to the teachings of Prophet Zarathustra, the world is a moral system
 is vyavastha ko swayan ko kaayam hi nahin rakhana he, balki apana vikaas tathaa sanvardhan bhi karnaa he
 Inertia is not allowed in Zarathosti religion
 vikaas kii prakriya main buree takatein baadha pahunchaati hai, parantu manushya ko isse vichlit nahin hona he
 He has to keep moving in the direction of development always while maintaining the path of virtue
 jivan ke prayek kshan kaa ek nishchit uddeshy he
 It is not something that starts spontaneously and ends spontaneously
 sab kuch ishwar kii yojana ke anusaar hota he

 manushya ko achchhai se, achchhai dwaara, achchhai ke liye jeena he
 'humat', 'huqt' and 'huvarshat' are the pillars of the Zarthosti way of life
 jarathosti dharm main mathvaad, brahmacharya, vrath-upwas, aatm daman aadi kii manaahi he
 It is believed that they weaken humans and reduce their strength to fight against evil
 nirashavad va avsaad ko to paap kaa darja diya gaya he
 Zarathustra wants humans to enjoy this world fully and be happy
 vah jo bhi kare, bas ek baat kaa khyaal avashya rakhe or vah yah ki sadachaar ke maarg se kabhi vichlit na ho
 a life endowed with material comforts is not forbidden, but it has also been said that you give more than what you take from the society
 kisi kaa haq markar yaa shoshan karke kuch paanaa duraachaar he
 Those who are less rich than us should always help
 jarathosti dharm main daihik mrityu ko buraai kii asthaayee jeet mana gaya he
 After this, the soul of the deceased will be judged
 yadi vah sadaachari hui to anand va prakaash main vaas paaegi or yadi duraachaari hui to andhkaar va nairashya kii gaharaaiyon main jaaegi, lekin duraachaari aatma kii yah sthiti bhi asthaayee he
 After all, Zoroastrian religion considers the ultimate aim of the world to be the victory of good, not the punishment of evil
 atah yah manyata he ki antat kai muktidaata aakar buraai par achchhai kii jeet puri karenge
 Then Ahura Mazda will be well-supported as Aseem Prakash
 phir atmaaon kaa antim faisla hoga
 After this the physical body will be resurrected and reunited with its own soul
