 Many sister cities share a water boundary which quite often serves as a border of both cities and counties
 For example, Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts appear to the casual traveler as a large city, while locally they are each culturally different and occupy different counties

 Comparative politics compares the politics of two or more countries or the politics of the same country at different times and it is seen what is the similarity and difference between them
 edward friman ke anusaar, tulanaatmak raajnneeti raajnneetik sansthaaon evam sarkaron ke vividh prakaaron kaa ek tulanaatmak vivechan evam vishleshan he
 According to Rolf Brabanti "comparative politics is the interpretation of the elements in the entire social system that affect political functions and their institutional publication
" " In the words of S
 Curtis, important regularities, similarities, and inequalities in the functioning of political institutions and political behavior are related to comparative politics
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti kii visheshtaayen:~ Comparative study in political science is not revolutionary and new
 raajnneeti main prarambh se hi tulanaatmak adhyayan kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 That is why Blondell stated that "the study of comparative governments is the oldest, most difficult and extremely important and has been the center of attention of man from the beginning
" " kintu tulanaatmak raajnneetik ke vyavasthit adhyayan kaa shrey arestu ko he
 Aristotle was the first to elaborately compare the characteristics and differences of autocratic systems, class systems and democracy present in the systems of the erstwhile political system
 arestu se lekar aadhunik raajnneetishastra ke vidwaanon tak ne raajnneetik vyavhaar ko samajhane ke liye raajnneetik vyavasthaaon kaa adhyayan, vishleshan or vargeekaran kiya he or naye–naye shodh upkarno ke madhyam se naye drushtikonon kii vyakhya kii he
 We find the tradition of comparative studies of politics and governance even before Aristotle
 baad main mekiaveli, mantescue, brice, laski, finer aadi vichaarkon ne is paddati ko apanaaya
 It continued to develop at a small level until the Second World War
 lekin, uske baad tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke kshetra main krantikari vikaas hue or ise ek naye anushaasan ke rup main viksit kiya jane laga
 Today it has become an important part of political science from a theoretical point of view and many theories and concepts have been born under it
 puraane vichaaron me arestu pehla raajnneetik darshanik tha jisane raajnneeti ko vigyaan kaa darja dena chaha
 He used to think about such problems and used such methods which are very much accepted even today in the field of political studies
 usne 158 samvidhanon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kar vaigyanik vidhi kaa prayog kiya
 Aristotle adopted the inductive method in political science for the first time
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa doosraa chinh maikayavali or punarjagran ke yug main miltaa he
 The origins of the state, the political system, abandoned the deductive method of governance, and thinkers like mackavali studied the circumstances of those days seriously, adopting a policy of scientific neutrality
 apane yug kii samasyaon ko samajha or phir nishkarsh par pahunche
 In this way he coordinated empiricism and history debates in his method of study
 usne raajnneeti ke adhyayan main itihaas or tark kaa sahaara liya
 We see the emergence of comparative studies of politics in some writers of the Montescue and Historical era
 heri ekstin kaa to nishkarsh he ki aadhunik tulanaatmak raajnneeti se sambandhit koi bhi pathak saralata se anumaan laga saktaa he ki mantescue dwaara vichaar kiye gayi vishay uske adhyayan kshetra main aate he
 In the thought of Montescue, political science should be studied with all human connections including the study of theology, geography, history, psychology, anthropology etc
 itihaasavaadi vichaarkon ke kai pramukh udhaaharan hamaare saamne hai, jaise vivek or prajatantra ke saath–saath vikaas main vishwaas karne vaala kant, vivek or swatantrata ko buniyadi maanate vaala higel, vaigyanik pravriti ko buniyadi maanane vaala kamte or varg–sangharsh ke madhyam se swatantraaa kii prapti main vishwaas karne vaala marks
 The greatest gift of these historians was that they awakened the interest of political historians in social mobility, especially in evolutionary theory, which led to the birth of elaborate theories of politics
 unhone un samasyaon kii ore bhi dhyaan diya jo raajnneeti or aarthik vikaas, raajnneeti or shiksha, saamaajik samskruti or raajnneeti ke bich sambandh jaisi samasyaon se sambandhit he
 After the Second World War, the right direction has developed in the field of comparative political
 pehle to manthar gati se vikaas hua, phir teji se nayi pravritiyaan ubharne lageen
 Understanding the importance of comparative studies first discovered new techniques, then new concepts like political analysis, political sociology etc
 developed
 pichley do dashakon main raajnneeti ke kshetra main tulanaatmak adhyayan kaa vikaas vishesh rup se or bady teji se hua
 Easton
 Amand, Carl Dr
 H
 Coleman, etc
, gave a new direction to comparative analysis under the system theory
 vyavastha ke siddhanth bahut hi mahatvapurn or upyogi siddh hue
 The theory made comparisons of all types of social systems beyond the state and the state possible
 lagbhag sabhi vidwaanon ne apni–apni vishesh shabdaawalee or bhashaa kaa vikaas kiya
 'input', 'output', 'feedback', 'cybernetics', etc
 are examples of this
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke shodh ke liye kai nayi paddatiyaan apanaayi gayin, jaise 'boating study', 'scalling technic', 'contint analysis’ aadi
 In recent years, the contributions of Dale, Aptor Rosto, Lucian Pai, Sidney Verba, Myron Winer, etc
 have special significance in the development of comparative politics
 unhone keval pashchimi deshon kaa hi adhyayan nahin kiya, balki navdith rashtron or tisare vishwa ke adhyayan ko hi vishesh mahatv diya
 Following are the new trends which were incorporated in the field of comparative politics after the Second World War: tulanaatmak raajnneeti kaa kshetra vivadpurn rahaa he
 The main reason is that its traditional and modern approaches do not match
 puraane raajnneetik vichaarak apane adhyayan kshetra ko keval shashan tathaa sarkaar ke dhaanche tak simit rakhte the jabaki aadhunik vidwaan iske kshetra ko bahut hi vyapak bana dete hai
 The subject area of comparative politics is as follows: - raajnneetik samajikaran tulanataamak raajnneeti kaa ek mahatvapurn adhyayan vishay he
 Political socialization is a process through which information about political values and attitudes is obtained
 raajnneetik samajikaran ek dirghakaalin prakriya he
 It starts from the life of the person and continues till his death
 vyakti apane bachapan se hi vibhinn raajnneetik vishyon main ruchi le ne lagata he or jivan paryant vah isse judaa rahata he
 Political socialization is included in comparative politics because the success or failure of a political system depends on political socialization
 praaia: viksit deshon main raajnneetik samajikaran kii prakriya teevr hoti he
 In contrast, this process is very slow in backward and developing countries
 raajnneetik sankruti se abhipraay ek raajnneetik vyavastha ke nagarikon ke us vyavastha ke prati drushtikon, vishwaas, bhaawanaaon tathaa mulyon se he
 Each political system has its own specific political culture
 raajnneetik samskruti hi yah spasht karti he ki log raajnneetik vyavastha ko kitna mahatv dete hai
 In fact, the success or failure of a political system depends on the political culture itself
 at: tulanaatmak raajnneetik adhyayanon main raajnneetik samskruti kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Traditional scholars of comparative politics considered the legislature, executive, judiciary and bureaucracy to be political subjects
 yadhyapi aajkal sansthaaon ke sthaan par kaary–paddati or vyaavhaarik paksh par adhik bal diya jaataa he, tathaapi raajnneetik saranchana ko bilkul choda nahin ja saktaa
 It is generally believed that the power of Parliament to take the final decision is getting reduced day by day and this power has come into the hands of the executive
 is sarkaar ke nishkarshon par pahunchne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki ham adhik se adhik deshon kii karypalika or vidhanmandalon kaa adhyayan karen
 Scholars of comparative politics also study the extent to which sections of society belong to those individuals who use the state power and what is the basis of their power
 prayek rajya me shashan kii shakti kuch vishisht logon yaa ek vishisht varg ke haathon main hoti he
 In countries that have a healthy party system, political parties are the main source of recruitment of teachers
 aarthik asamanta or raajnneetik shaskaon kii bhartee ke bhang kaa raajnneetik hinsa or aantarik kalah se gaharaa sambandh he
 In the words of Crisis and Ward, "in countries in which certain special sections of society are deprived of 'political power', these classes try to grab power by violent means
 " Emphasis has been given more on comparative studies in comparative politics
 iske antargat raajnneetik sansthaaon, unki sanrachnaao kii apeksha iske kriyasheel kaaryakrttaaon athwa tatwon ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan hota he
 The modern era is the era of democracy and parties are essential in democracy
 praaia: sabhi de shon main raajnneetik dal paye jate hai
 Two-party system is found in USA, Great Britain, Australia and Germany, while multi-party system is found in countries like France, Italy, Norway, India etc
 samyavaadee china, cuba, uttari korea, vietnam aadi me ekadaleey paddati vidyaman he
 The student of comparative politics studies the organization, programs and functions of political parties
 raajnneeti dal hi nahin, balki hit–samooh bhi raajnneetik sakriyata ke mahatvapurn pahalu hai
 Interest groups play an important role in determining the policies of parties and government
 majdoor sangh, railway unionon, vyapaariyon ke sangh, vyavsaayik sangh ityadi sabhi dabaav guton kii shrenee main aate hai america, brit na, france, ityadi loktantreey rajyon main dabaav samooh sarkari nirnyo ko kaaphi prabhavit karte hai, jabaki china, ityadi samyavaadee de shon main inkaa mahatv bahut kam he
 Scholars of comparative politics also consider these questions - what effect does the spread of education have on the political conduct of citizens and their political institutions', what changes are there in different castes and religious allegiance that are within the same society
 The Is it possible through economic development that the allegiance of citizens of Asia and Africa to their family, clan, village, clan, religion and caste is gradually eradicated and a sense of nationality can develop in their place? tulanaatmak raajnneeti main na keval viksit pashchimi deshon kii shashan pranaaliyon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, balki isamen asia or africa ke pichde or vikasshil deshon kii shashan pranaaliyon kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Political participation refers to the participation of citizens in political activities
 sabhi raajnneetik pranaaliyon main raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa str ek samaan nahin hota
 Citizens participate more in political activities in liberal democratic political systems whereas backward and totalitarian political systems do not get much opportunities for political participation
 vastav main raajnneetik bhagidaari hi kisi vyavastha ke auchity kii kasuti maani jaati he
 The importance of participation in comparative politics
 prayek raajnneeti pranali main anek raajnneetik prakriyaayein chalati rahati hai
 In every political system, the process of decision making, judicial process, etc
, many processes go on continuously
 in raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa raajnneetik vyavastha par prabhaav padataa he
 Hence political processes are studied in comparative politics
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti me 'yuddh or shaanti' tathaa shakti santulan kii samasyaon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 There are some important questions related to this
 naukarshahi kii prayek raajnneetik vyavastha main atyant mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he
 Bureaucracy has become the backbone of government or administration, especially in the current political systems
 yadi aadhunik yug ko naukarshahi kaa yug kaha jaae to galat na hoga
 Along with the notion of a welfare state, the role of bureaucracy also increased
 yaheen kaaran he ki aaj chaahe niti kaa nirmaan karnaa ho yaa kriyanvayan karnaa ho, naukarshahi sadaiv pratham rahati he
 Bureaucracy is accepted as a tool in socio-economic change, so bureaucracy is studied in comparative politics
 aadhunik yug main tulanaatmak raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra keval maatr raajnneeti shaastra ke adhyayan tak hi simit nahin he, balki isamen raajnneetik vyavastha ke vyaavhaarik raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan hone ke kaaran iske vishay kshetra main kaaphi vruddhi hu i he
 For this reason, comparative politics has become an inter-disciplinary approach
 ab tulanaatmak raajnneeti main raajnneetik shaastra ke alaava anya saamaajik vigyaanon jaise ki samajashaastra, manovigyaan, arthshaastra, itihaas, vigyaan, rasayan vigyaan ityadi kaa bhi adhyay kiya jaataa he
 Modern scholars believe that the complexities of political systems can be understood well in social and economic contexts
 raajnneeti kaa sambandh raajnneetik vyavastha ke aadarshatmak swaroop kii apeksha uske vyaavhaarik va vaastavik swaroop se adhik he
 That is why in comparative politics, price-intervention political principles have been replaced by non-value political principles
 is prakaar tulanaatmak raajnneeti kaa kshetra bahut kuch spasht, sunishchit or nirdhaarit ho gaya he
 G
 K
 Robtter's statement seems correct, thus, that comparative politics has proved to be 'nothing' and its counter-claim that it is 'everything' has been modified
 arthath tulanaatmak raajnneeti kaa apana swayan kaa vishay kshetra ban gaya he
 But it does not mean that such an independent scripture of comparative politics has been made which has no relation with politics
 puraane raajnneetik vichaarkon dwaara tulanaatmak adhyayan main apanaaye gayi tareeko ko paramparaagat drushtikon kaha jaataa he
 Five main features of the traditional approach to comparative politics are given: - raajnneeti ke kshetra main naye vishleshanon or adhyayanon kii aavashyaktaa padi
 Therefore new methods and approaches began to be discovered
 vishleshan or pareekshan kii nayi paddati or naye drushtikonon kaa vikaas hua
 Thus scholars like Lord Bryce, Frederick tried to give a new direction to comparative politics, but its literature developed only in recent years
 amand lucian pai, sidney varba, david i
 epter aadi aadhunik vidwaanon ne tulanaatmak raajnneetik ko aadhunik rup diya
 The same principles and values are used for comparison
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti kaa aadhunik drushtikon adhik pareekshan karne vaala, adhik khojbin karne vaala or adhik vyavasthit he
 This study attempts to go to the core of political institutions
 aadhunik drushtikon main hit samoohon, dabaav samoohon, raajnneetik dalon ke vichaardhaara se prabhavit vyavhaaron kaa vishesh adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This approach explores real connections between political and other behaviors
 aaj vishwa main 190 se adhik prabhutaa praapt desh hai
 The people of the new nations are no longer as straightforward and humble as the people of the colonies
 aaj ke samudaay purv kii tulana main kahin adhik raajnneetikrut he
 The political participation of the public is increasing in all countries

 There has been a revolution in the field of communication in the present century
 jansadharan tak pahunchne ke sanchaar madhyamon ne jansadharan main raajnneetik jagriti ko bahut badhaayaa he
 Comparative politics studies political behavior and is very helpful in understanding and explaining it
 iske dwaara raajnneeti ke adhyayan ko vaigyanik swaroop pradaan kiya gaya he tathaa raajnneeti main vyavhaarik saamaanya niyamon athwa siddhanto kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 The study of comparative politics has two purposes in a general form, which we can summarize as follows
 pratham, yah hamen videshon main shashan or raajnneeti ke kshetra main ghati or sambhavit ghatnaon kaa acchhee tarah se nirvachan karne main sahaayta detaa he
 Secondly, the governance practices of various states are determined by their historical and geographical conditions, social, economic and political institutions and ideas
 adhiktar deshon main shashan paddati or vichaardhaara kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 The study of comparative politics is useful for students of sociology, for various reasons
 kisi bhi desh ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye, yah ek prakaar se videshon kii maargdarshita ke samaan he
 Students get many types of useful and educative information about other countries
 aise hi, yadi ham haal hi main swatantra hue kuch alpaviksit de shon kii raajnneetik paddatiyon kii 20 tulana karen to unamem se prayek main puraane videshi shaskaon dwaara vahi kaayam kii gayi sansthaaon or unki paramparaon kaa gyaan unke vartmaan antaron ko samajhane ke liye praapt karnaa ati aavashyak he
 We can get its knowledge only through comparative study
 duusare shabdon main, sanrachanaatmak–kaaryaatmak upaagam raajnneetik paddatiyon kii gaharaai main parishkrut paribhaasha kii ore jane kaa prayaas karata he
 It tries to find out the most important institutions in each method and to reach the classification and explanation of their political differences and similarities
 We can determine the hypothesis about political behavior and actions of government and with the help of such words We can compare different political methods
 tulanaatmak paddati abhi 'pravaah kii sthiti' main he
 It has not reached a decisive or final position
 atev, iske raste main anek kathinaaiyaan paayi jaati he

 For this, some degree of similarity in the subjects of comparison is necessary and the learner should be fully aware of them
 teesri samasya vibhinn rashtron kii samskritiyon ke adhyayan or videshi bhashaaon ke prayog ke sambandh main paidaa hota he
 Knowledge of various nations' shapes and foreign languages is necessary for comparative study
 kisi bhi shodhakartta ke liye sabhi bhashaaon kii jaankaree praapt karnaa sambhav nahin he or naa to vibhinn deshon kii samskruti ke bare main sahi or puri jaankaree praapt kar lenaa hi sambhav he
 The fourth difficulty relates to the collection of data and the use of scientific methods in the Rajitsharatra

 ■ Wolf is a 1994 American romantic-horror film directed by Mike Nicklas and co-written by Jim Harrison, Wesley Streak and indirectly by Ellen Maye
 sangeet aneo marikan or chhayankan jispi ratunno ne diya he
 The film's lead role is played by Jack Nicholson and Micheal Pfeffer and co-starring James Spader, Kate Nelligan, Richard Jenkins, Christopher Plummer, Eileen Atkins, David Hyde Pearce and Om Puri
 vermant se ghar laut rahe vil rendal jangal raste main car se ek bhedie ko takkar maar baithte he, mara hua jaanakar use hataane dauraan bhediya vil ko dhokhe se katkar bhaag nikalataa he
 On the other hand, Will Rendall and his office colleagues discuss that his publishing house has been taken over by Raymond Alden, a stubborn billionaire, and that Will is being removed from the position of Chief in Editor and assigned to his subordinate Stewart Swinton
 is darmyaan vil khud main is manovaigyanik rup se tabdiliyaan mahasoos karata he, ab usamen khuraaq or jismani bhukh kii tarah uski adhed or sust indriyon main chaitanyata aa jaati he
 There is some suspicion while smelling his wife Sherlott's clothes at home and rushing home and reaches Stewart's house
 stewart ke rokane kii koshish main vil uski hatheli par daant gadaakar bhaagate hue sidhiyon par kulaanche bharta hua uske bedroom pahunchataa he, jidhar sherlot ko apattijanak sthiti par uski behayaayi kaa yakeen ho jaataa he
 On this infidelity of Charlotte, Will leaves home and stays in another location in Mayflower Hotel
 udhar apane tanhai se ubarne ke liye vah remand elden kii naakhush beti lara par aasakt hone lagata he
 He stops at Laara's guesthouse and then wakes up on the night of the Puranmasi to find a wolf hunter, hunting for a deer strolling through Alden's estate in Alden's estate
 agali subah neend tutane par vil nadi ke ek sote kinare paata he, lekin apane hi chehre or haathon ko kun main sanaa dekhakar vah ghabara jaataa he or chhipate-chhupate apni valvo se bhaag nikalataa he
 After the necessary formal examination by the doctor, he is an Indian paranormal expert, Dr
 Vijay meets Allezius, where he offers a silver talisman to get rid of that gothic flourish in Will, but since Dr
 Vijay is at the last stage of his age after his declining health, he is told to become a wolf human after being bitten by Will and to get rid of this moment's torture
 lekin vil chunki khud is daraavne badlaav se waakif he wo inkaar karata he, lekin wo tabiz is khyaal se apane paas rakhata he ki kahin uske bheetar kaa jaanavar dubaara na jaag jaae
 Then, in the evening, Will arrives at the hotel and laments Laura for disappearing from the previous night, and asks him to come to the hotel to meet her again
 lagbhag usee shaam jab punam kaa chand badhata he, vil ke andar kaa bhediya us par haaavee hota he, or shahar kii chidyaghar se aa rahi jaanwaron ke shorgul se khinchaa chalaa jaataa, par uske kuch karne se purv hi vahaan maujud do police officer use dhar lete he or lekin hathkadi lagane ke prayaas main vil behad furti se diwaar kudakar baahar ek sunsaan raste pahunchataa he, lekin vahaan kuch teen uthaigiri kism ke log usase paise chhinane ko dhamkaate he or vil unheen par hamalaakar buree tarah maar detaa he
 vil apane rum vaapis lautataa he par agali soobah use beeti raat ke bare main kuch yaad nahin padataa
 At the same time, in the effort of Will, he subordinated the group of all his main writers
 Returning from Alden, he seizes the chair of his editor Ein Chief, whose news comes as a surprise to Stewart, who is in the toilet, and notices his dismissal through his second additional official force
 is varchasv ke bahaane vah stewart ke jute par peshaab kar vil khud ke ilaake banane kii baat kahata he
 When angry Stewart goes out, when she removes a handkerchief from her jacket to wash and wipe, a fallen human finger also falls into the washbasin
 Will has no where to go and troubles, and from there, he runs out of disgrace
 vahiin hotel kii labi se guzarane dauraan vil ko sharlat rokatii he, or stewart se judi nazaij rishton ke khatm hone or is pashchaatap ke liye usase maafee maangati he, magar vil ab usase kisi bhi tarah kaa vaasta nahin rakhana chahta or dutkaarte hue dfa hone ko kahata he
 vahiin paas ke vatting coach par baithi lara un donon kii baaten sun leti he, sharlat ke hatane baad lara vil ke peeche ho leti he
 Will, in the room, wears the talisman for fear of waking up to his bride, and imprisons himself with handcuffs found the previous night
 lara kisi prakaar ek hotelkarmi se ekastra chaabi se darwaja khol andar daakhil hoti he
 In the third meeting, both of them get rid of Will's handcuffs
 is bich jab lara gahari neend main hoti he vil main maujud bhediya jaagta he or chandani raat main baahar park jaakar hunk lagaataa he, aas-paas tahaltey log lagbhag dar se tharra jate he
 raat bitne par vil vaapis apane bistar lautataa he
 
 agali subah detective karl bridger or detective vade vil ko rah khabar dete he ki uski bivi sharlat kaa kisi ne berahami galaa kaat kar katl kiya he
 Will is overcome by the news, Detective Bridger calls Will to ask for Sherlot's identity and his suspects at the police station
 in sabake bich stewart or remand ko tivi samaacharon par vil kii patni sherlot kii katl kii khabaren milti he
 Randall tells Stewart that if Will's evidence in this crime is confirmed, the editor-in-chief's chair will be transferred to Roy mcallister
 tab stewart bhi kahata he ki agar donon main se kuch aashaatheet na hua to vah vaapis naukari par aana chahega
 When the same Laura takes Will to her father's estate, all his doubts turn into fear
 vil ke juto main lagi mitti, apni atisamvedansheel kaanon se dur phone kii ring ko sunanaa, or phone par detective brij par yah maaloom hona ki sherlot kii katl kii forencik report main kisi jaanavar ke diene jude nishaan mili he
 Now Laura is convinced that the beast responsible for the killings by Will is inside her
 phir lara ko vil ke kehane par use ghodon ke astabal main band karnaa padataa he or police stesan ittala karne jaati he
 But by chance, Stewart meets there, which he had reached to witness Sherlott's murder
 lekin stewart kii pili ankhe, lara ke sharir se vil kii gandh pataa hone par lara ko ehsaas hota he ki stewart bhi vil ke dansh kaa shikaar he or vah bhi bhediya ban rahaa he
 Stewart goes to the cabin, asking him to date her, and Laura finds an opportunity to escape
 lara ko vil ke nirdosh hone yakeen ho jaataa he or vahaan shahar se bhaag nikalalane kaa faisla leti he
 On the other hand, Stewart also follows Laara to her estate and the gateman is crushed under her jeep in an attempt to stop her
 phir garden main ek or sangharsh ke baad lara stewart kii pakad main aati he, lekin stewart ke balaatkaar karne ke prayaas main lara kisi tarah jaan chhudaakar astabal main ghus jaati he
 Stewart pounces again on Lara, while imprisoned Will captures Stewart by breaking the talisman from the cage
 purnamasi kii raat or jabardast gusse main donon ke andar kaa bhediya haaavee hota he or vahashiyon kii tarah ek-duusare par tut padate he
 Will slams Stewart on the stairs and proceeds to lara
 peeche stewart jhaadi kaatane vaali kanchi lekar usapar kud lagaataa he, lara jaldi se saamne mrit guard kii pistaul se us par shut karke khatm karti he
 Will and Laura linger silently expressing their regret and Will quietly escapes towards the forest
 or lagbhag usee shaam police or remand ghatnasthal par pahunchati he, lara lagbhag in sabase anjaan or bhaybheet hone kaa bahaanaa karti he
 Detective Bridger reveals lara and Will's friendship, but lara cleverly avoids the talk
 phir lara unase vodaka kii gangh aane par drink kaa nyotaa detii he, brij ko hairaani hoti he ki is baat ko ghanton biit chuke he use kaise pataa ? lara jawaab detii he ki use to mile bhar dur gandh kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Now the same paleness is seen in Lara's eyes
 dur kahin vil puri tarah bhedie ke rup main chand ke mukhaatib hunkaarta he or lara kaa cheharaa bhi dhundhlate hue jaanavar main badalata jaataa he
