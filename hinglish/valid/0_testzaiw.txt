1 f Ethanol is a well-known alcohol
 ise ethil alcohol bhi kehete hai
 There are two different methods of preparing it: sanshleshan vidhi-ethilin gas ko sandra salfurik amla main shoshit karaane se ethil hydrogen salphet banataa he jo jal ke saath ubaalane par uddhighatit hokar ethil alcohol detaa he
 The prevalence of this method is not yet high
 kinvikaran vidhi- iske dwaara kisi bhi shakkarmay padaarth yaa starchamay padaarth se alcohol vyapaarik maatra main banaate hai
 This reaction can be broadly written as follows: saadhaarant: alcohol shire se, jo shakkar or chukundar ke milon main vyarth bachaa padaarth he, banaaya jaataa he
 About 30 to 35 percent sugarcane sugar in molasses and about the same glucose and fructose is dissolved
 shore main itnaa hi jal milaayaa jaataa he jitne se uskaa aapekshik ghanatv 1
03 se lekar 1
04 tak ho jaataa he
 To prevent the growth of bacteria and other unnecessary ferments, a few drops of sulfuric acid are added to this solution
 ab isamen thodaa sa yeast daalkar ise 30°-40° centegrade taap par rakh dete hai
 At about 40-50 hours, denaturing ceases
 is prakaar se shire kii lagbhag 95% shakkar vicchhinn hokar alcohol or carbon-daai-oxide main parivartit ho jaati he
 Starchy substances are first boiled in hot steam by cutting into small pieces or grinding with water
 starchamay padaarth lei kii tarah ho jaataa he; ise halava kehete hai
 Mix a little malt extract in the mash and keep it at 55 ° -60 ° c temperature
 malt nishkarsh main vidyaman diastess-enzim dwaara starch kaa udvighathan hokar maltose banataa he
 This process takes about half an hour and the fluid that is found in this way is called a decoction
 kwath ko ubalkar isamen vidyaman diastess ko nasht kar dete hai; ise 20° sein
 taap tak thanda kar isamen yeast daalate hai or phir ise 20°-37° sein
 ke bich rakh chhodte hai
 Maltase-enzymes present in yeast extract the maltose into glucose
 is glucose ko phir zimes-enzim dwaara vighatit kar alcohol praapt karte hai
 In this way it takes 3-4 days to make alkol

 firoz shah tululaq dilli sultanate main tululaq vansh kaa shaasha tha
 Ferozeshah Tughlaq was born on 1309
 wo bharat par antim muslim shaasha tha
 He ruled from 1351 to 1388
 wo, dipalpur kii hidun rajkumaari kaa putr tha
 He forced many Hindus to adopt Muslim religion during his rule
 usne apane shasankaal main hi chaandi ke sikke chalaaye| firozshah tululaq, mohammad tululaq kaa chachera bhai evam sipahsalaar 'rajab' kaa putr tha
 His mother 'bibi Jaizella' was the daughter of Rajput chieftain Rajamal
 mohammad tululaq kii mutyu ke baad 20 march 1351 ko firoz tululaq kaa rajbhishak thatta ke nikat hua
 Feroze was crowned again in Delhi in August, 1351
 sultan banane ke baad firozshah tululaq ne sabhi qarze maaf kar die, jisamen 'sondhar rin' bhi shaamil tha, jo mohammad tululaq ke samay kisaanon ko diya gaya tha
 After becoming Sultan, Feroze Tughlaq invaded Bengal and Sindh as part of his campaign to conquer his territories separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal ko jeetne ke liye sultan ne 1353 i
 main akraman kiya
 At that time, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was the ruler of that place
 usne ikdala ke qile main sharan le rakhi thi, sultan firoz antatah qile par adhikaar karne main asafal hokar 1355 i

 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Thus it can be said that Sultan Firuz Tughlaq did not undertake any military campaign during his reign for the expansion of the empire and whatever campaign he did, only to save the empire
 rajasav vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne apane shashan kaal main 24 kshtdaayak karon ko samaapt kar diya or keval 4 kar ‘karaaj’, ‘khums’, ‘jazia’, evam 'zakaat' ko vasuul karne kaa aadesh diya

 During the reign of Firoz, the number of slaves reached about 1,80,000
 inaki dekhbhaal hetu sultan de 'dewan-e-bandaraan' kii sthapana kii
 Some slaves were sent to the provinces and the rest were kept in the center

 usne hindu janata ko ‘jimmy’ kaha or hindu brahmanon par jazia kar lagaaya
 Dr
 R
C
 Majumdar has stated that, "firuz was the most fanatical of this era and the Sinkadar Lodi and Aurangzeb in this region was outgoing
 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas
 usne 'jiyauddin barani' evam 'shams-e-siraaj afif' ko apana sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Barani composed 'fatwa-e-jahandari' and 'date-e-firozshahi'
 firoz ne apni aatmakatha ‘phutuhat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kii jabaki ‘sirat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kisi agyaat viddhan dwaara kii gai he
 Firoz translated some of the 1300 texts looted from the library of the Jwalamukhi temple under the name 'dalaiyte-firozshahi' by Eduddin

 khwaja hisamuddin ke ek anumaan ke anusaar- firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal kii vaarshik aay 6 karod 75 lakh takaad Firoz Tughlaq issued a large number of coins made of a mixture of copper and silver under the currency system, which were probably called 'adha' and 'egypt'
 firoz tululaq ne ‘shanshgani’ kaa nayaa sikaa chalavaaya tha
 He inscribed the name of his son or successor 'fatah Khan' with his name on the coins
 firoz ne apane ko caliph kaa nib pukaara tathaa sikkon par caliph kaa naam ankit karavaaya
 The rule of Ferozeshah Tughlaq was based on welfare autocracy

 bharat ke kisi bhi abhayaarany kii charchaa itani nahin thi jitani billy ke is privet faresti kii thi jise sari duniya tiger haven ko jaanati he
 After the Second World War, this international figure, Billy Arjan Singh, left the british-indian Army and made the vast forests of Kheri his own and made a beautiful result, which we know today as Dudhwa National Park
 shuruwati dinon main palia se sampoornanagar jane vaali sadak par apane pita jasvir singh ke naam par ek farm house kaa nirmaan kiya or kheti ko apana jariya banaaya
 Once a hunter, Billy, riding in his forest one day, entered the forest and was stunned to see the middle part of the Suheli and Nevara rivers, covered with incomparable natural beauty, the earth around which extended forests of shaku
 yahi vah ghadi thi jisane tiger haven ke pradurbhaav kaa nishchay kar diya tha
 This forest was purchased by Billy in 1969 AD, with saritas in the south-north and dense forests in the west-east
 or yahan baaghon or tenduon ke liye tiger haven kii sthapana kii
 Due to the continuous efforts of Arjan Singh, Dudhwa National Park was started in 1977 and then the Tiger Project was started and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve was established in 1988 by combining Dudhwa National Park and Kishanpur Wildlife Vihar
 tiger haven se sate sathiana renj ke jangalon main barasinha ke awaas he jise sangrakshit karwaane main billy kaa yogadan vismaraneey he
 Arjan Singh always kept saying that wild-life should be separated from forest department and made a separate department, wild-life department! Because at that time, the forest department was more in the attempt to cut down the forest than to save it, the government was treating the forests by timber mafia
 yadi yah alag vibhaag bana diya jaay to isamen shaamil hone vaale log vanya-jivan kii visheshgyata hasil karke aayenge
 The broken chains of forests were a matter of concern for Billy, because the tigers are very large and if the forests shrink, the tigers will also become less! In this once inaccessible area, "the Collective Farms and Forest Limited cleared 10,000 hectares of forested land and people migrated from Pakistan, later settled in Bhoodan Andolan
 Turned into fields
 or dudhwa jangal kaa van-tapu main tabdeel ho gaya
 Which always annoyed Billy
 aazaadee ke baad jis tarah is junglee kshetra main logon ne ruukh kiya or van-bhoomi ko krishi bhumin main tabdeel karte chale gayi vahi vajah ab baaghon or anya jeevon ke astitv ko mitaa rahi he
 It was because of his desire to have more protected areas for tigers that the Kishanpur wildlife sanctuary came into existence, which is now a part of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve

 The work done by Billy Arjan Singh to trend the cubs of tigers and leopards by rehabilitating them in their natural habitat i

 in the forest is unique in the whole world

 The result is the generation of Tara which is flourishing in the forests of Dudhwa
 billy ko tara ke siberian yaa anya naslon kaa mila-jula hona bataakar badnaam karne kii koshish kii or ise naam diya "anuvanshik pradooshan" jabaki anuvashik vigyaan ke mutabik bhugolic simaaon va vibhinn vaataavaraniya kshetron main rahane vaali jatiyon kaa aapas main sambadh hanikaarak nahin hota he balki behatar hota hai
 If that were the case, no British would establish matrimonial relations in any Asian country, nor any Asian or American
 bhartiya parampara main bhi samgotreey vaivaahik sambadh amaanya he or vigyaan kii drushti main bhi, fir kaise siberian yani rus kii nasl vaali is baghin kaa bharat ke baaghon se sambadh anuvashik pradooshan hai
 In order to avoid the dangers of in-breeding, they establish relationships between organisms of different communities so that their gene-diversity is maintained and Billy thus established this diversity among the tigers of Dudhwa
 dudhwa main tara kii vashanwali nirantar sanmriddh ho rahi he, dudhwa ke baaghon main indo-siberian nasl kii upasthit ko ek vaigyanik santhaan bhi maan chukaa he, kintu adhikarik taur par ise maanane main intjamiyaan dar rahi he
 It has been proved that tigers in Dudhwa forest are strengthening this breed with gene diversity of siberian-royal Bengal tiger
 is anuvanshik vivadhita ke kaaran bhartiya baaghon kii nasl ab or behatar hogi
 Otherwise, these tigers in the jungles of the shrunk forests would maintain a relationship 


 in the same gene pool 


 and in-breeding would weaken their breed

 In resistance welds, mechanical pressure along with electric current is used to connect two pieces of metal
 weldon electrodon main us samay dhara bahati he jab veld kiye ja rahe donon tukade aapas main jud rahe hote hai
 In this process of Weldon, the first electric current produces at least enough heat in a small part of the metals to liquefy there
 iske baad dono tukade kuch der tak dabaakar hi rakhe jate hai taaki pighali hui dhaatu thandi ho jaay or usamen aaps main jude rahane ke liye paryaapt shakti aa jaay
 Flammation weldons, spots, projections, suture and percussion methods are the main features of weld by resistance welds
 weldon kii yah vidhi bhi takkar kii weldon vidhi ke samaan hi he, bhed keval itnaa hi he ki donon pindon ko sampark main laane ke pehle hi yantra main vidyut dhara pravaahit kar di jaati he or pindon ke nikat aane par unke bich ke antaraal main vidyut arq ke chaalu hone se dhatupind ke kinare pighalane lagate hai
 When some of the metal spills start bouncing from them, then close the current and press them and connect them with the device itself
 weldon kii yah vidhi vahi apanaai jaati he jahaan dhaatu kii chaadaron ke kinaaron ko ek par ek rakhkar jodna ho
 Its principle is also similar to that of percussion weldons
 iskaa siddhant bhi takkar ke weldon ke samaan hi he
 In this work device, the welders place the edges on top of each other, between the two electrodes in the device
 phir pair se ek liver ko dabaane par, uuparavaala electrode neeche utarkar sampidit vaayu kii shakti se un platon ko dabaa detaa he or electrodon tathaa platon ke sampark main aate hi, usamen vidyut dhara pravaahit hokar platon main se hoti hui neeche ke electrode main pravesh karti he, us samay platon kaa vah bhaag, jo un electrodon ke sampark main aata he, garam hokar jyon hi weldon ke taap par pahunchataa he, un electrodon kaa dabaav or badha diya jaataa he, jisase ve us sthaan par aapas main jud jate hai or vahaan ek chitti si pad jaati he
 The principles of this method of Weldon are also the same as those of the weld, the only difference being that the heat from the electrode is concentrated at a small point
 vaise electrodon kaa kshetrafal to kaaphi bada hota he
 To concentrate the heat, a bulge or crater is made in one or both plates
 is vidhi se vibhinn motaai ke platon ko bhi aapas main joda ja saktaa he
 This method is also similar in principle and action to Chitti Weldon, the difference being that the electrodes are made by rotating cylinders instead of being of the shape of a stationary column, and the joining plates are driven mechanically between them and the current of those cylinders Intermittently goes on spinning
 dhara ke pravaahit hone or rukne ke samay kaa anupaat 1:1 se lekar 1:10 tak rakhaa ja saktaa he, is kaaran jod aisa lagata he maano dore se si diya gaya ho
 In this method, one piece of machine is fastened by binding one piece to the first, and then in a second screw sliding the other piece
 ki donon ko nikat laane par jod sahi sahi baith jaae
 These two screws are electrically insulated from each other by the insulating currents, and the current of one current is not able to pass into the other
 jab sarkanevaale shikanje ko dhatupind sahit sthir shinkaje kii ore sarkaate hai, tab in dhatupindon ke judanevaale kinaaron kaa taap, kinaaron ke nikat aane par, vidyut dhara ke ucch pratirodh ke prabhaav se ekadam garam hone ke kaaran, weldon ke taap tak pahunch jaataa he; phir kinaaron ko dhire-dhire khub dabaa diya jaataa he or vidyut dhara band kar di jaati he
