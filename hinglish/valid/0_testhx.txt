 By Kalyan Chand
 tathy vaanchit chand raajaaon ke samay main ise raajpur kaha jaataa tha
 The name 'rajpur' has also been mentioned on many ancient copper plates
 ek puranic katha ke anisaar daksh prajapati kii putree uma kaa vivaah shiv se hua tha
 Daksha Prajapati did not like Shiva, but he could not defer the requests of the gods, so he did not want his daughter to marry Shiva
 ek baar daksh prajapati ne sabhi devataaon ko apane yahan yajna main bulaayaa, parantu apane damaad shiv or beti uma ko nimantran tak nahin diya
 Uma stubbornly reached this yagna
 jab usne haridwar sthit canarvan main apane pita ke yajna main sabhi devataaon kaa sammaan or apane pati or apni niraadar hote hue dekha to vah atyant du:khee ho gayi
 In the Havan Kund of the yagna, she jumped and said, "I will make Shiva my husband in the next life too
" apane meraa or mere pati kaa jo niraadar kiya iske pratifal - swarup yajna ke havan - kund main syvan jalakar aapke yajna ko asafal karti hoon
 'when Shiva came to know that Uma became Sati, his anger was no longer in the cross
 unhone apane ganon ke dwaara daksh prajapati ke yajna ko nasht - bhrasht kar daalaa
 All the Gods and Gods, seeing this insurmountable form of Shiva, started thinking that Shiva should not be destroyed
 isliye devi - devataaon ne mahadev shiv se prarthana kii or unke krodh ko shant kiya
 Daksha Prajapati also apologized
 shiv ne unako bhi aashirwad diya
 However, upon seeing Sati's burnt body, his quietness swelled
 unhone sati ke jaale hue sharir ko kandhe par daalkar akaash - bhraman karnaa shuru kar diya
 In such a situation, wherever the parts of the body fall, there the power returned
 jahaan par sati ke nayan gire the ; vahiin par nainadevi ke rup main uma arthath nanda devi kaa bhavy sthaan ho gaya
 Today's Nainital is the place where the Nain of that goddess fell

 Ever since then, Shivapathi Nanda is worshiped here as Nainadevi
 yahaan ke nikat ek gaanv main machhlee evam ghongho ke jeevashm paye gayi hai jisase ingit hota he ki pithauragarh kaa kshetra himalay ke nirmaan se pehle ek vishaal jhil rahaa hoga
 Until recently, Pithoragarh has been ruled by the Khas dynasty, who are credited with building forts or coats here
 pithauragarh ke aasapaasd chaar coten hai jo bhatkot, duungarkot, udaikot tathaa oonchakot hai
 After the Khas dynasty, the Kachudi dynasty ruled here and the king of this dynasty was Ashok Malla, a contemporary of Balban
 isi avadhi main raja pithora dwaara pithauragarh sthapit kiya gaya tathaa isi ke naam par pithauragarh naam bhi padaa
 Three kings of this dynasty ruled from Pithoragarh itself and the brick fort built by them in the nearby village of Khakot was demolished by the then Collector of Pithoragarh in the year 1560
 varsh 1622 se aage pithauragarh par chand vansh kaa aadhipaty rahaa
 There is another controversial description of the history of Pithoragarh
 atkins ke anusaar, chand vansh ke ek samant piru gosai ne pithauragarh kii sthapana kii
 It seems that during the reign of King Bharti Chand of the Chand dynasty, his son Ratna Chand defeated King Doti of Nepal and took control of the Solar Valley and in 1449 merged it with Kumaon or Kurmanchal
 usee ke shasankaal main piru yaa prithvi gosai ne pithauragarh naam se yahaan ek kila banaaya
 It was later named Pithoragarh after the fort itself
 chandon ne adhikansh kumaun par apana adhikaar vistrut kar liya jahaan unhone varsh 1790 tak shashan kiya
 He defeated many tribes and also fought with the neighboring kings so that their position would be strengthened
 varsh 1790 main, gorkhiyaali kahe jane vaale gorakhon ne kumaun par adhikaar jamaakar chand vansh kaa shashan samaapt kar diya
 The exploitation of the Gorkha rulers came to an end in the year 1815 when the East India Company defeated them and established their suzerainty over Kumaon
 atkins ke anusaar, varsh 1881 main pithauragarh kii kul jansankhya 552 thi
 During the British era there was a military cantonment, a church and a mission school

 Till 1960, Pithoragarh was a tehsil of Almora district with the preponderance of the British, after which it became a district
 varsh 1997 main pithauragarh ke kuch bhaagon ko katkar ek nayaa jila champavat banaaya gaya tathaa isaki seemaa ko punarnirdhaarit kar diya gaya
 In the year 2000, Pithoragarh became a part of the new state of Uttarakhand
 tehri or gadhwal do alag naamon ko milakar is jile kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Where Tehri is derived from the word 'trihri', which means a place that washes away three types of sins, while the second word is made from 'garh', which means fort
 san 888 se purv sara gadhwal kshetra chote chote ‘gadhon’ main vibhajit tha, jinamein alag-alag raja rajya karte the jinhen ‘rana’, ‘raay’ yaa ‘thakur’ ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 It is said that Prince Kanakpal of Malwa once visited Badrinathji where he met the mighty King Bhanu Pratap
 raja bhanu pratap unase kaaphi prabhavit hue or apni iklauti beti kaa vivaah kanakapaal se karvaa diya saath hi apana rajya bhi unhen de diya
 Gradually Kanakpal and his succeeding generations won their strongholds one by one and grew their kingdom
 is prakaar san 1803 tak sara gadhwal kshetra inke adhikaar main aa gaya
 Unsuccessful attacks by Gurkhas continued in those years, but in 1803, the Gurkhas were finally conquered in a battle of Dehradun in which King Pradvamun Shah was killed
 lekin unke shahjade jo us samay chote the vafaadaaron ke haathon bachaa liye gayi
 Gradually, the dominance of Gurkhas grew and they ruled for almost 12 years
 inkaa rajya kangra tak failaa hua tha, phir gorkhaon ko maharaja ranjit singh ne kangra se nikaal baahar kiya
 And here Sudarshan Shah, with the help of East India Company, recaptured his kingdom from the Gorkhas
 east india company ne phir kumaanun, dehradun or purv gadhwal ko british samrajya main mila diya or pashchim gadhwal raja sudarshan shah ko de diya jise tab tehari riyasat ke naam se janaa gaya
 King Sudarshan Shah made his capital Tehri or Tehri Nagar, later his successors Pratap Shah, Kirti Shah and Narendra Shah established the capital of this state, Pratap Nagar, Kirti Nagar and Narendra Nagar respectively
 in teenon ne 1815 se san 1949 tak raaj kiya
 Then during the Quit India movement, people here also participated very vigorously

 It was becoming difficult for the Maharaja to rule now
 or phir ant main 60 wein raja manvendra shah ne bharat ke saath ek ho janaa swikar kar liya
 Thus in 1949, Tehri State was merged with Uttar Pradesh and made a district of the same name
 baad main 24 farvari 1960 main uttar pradesh sarkaar ne isaki ek tehsil ko alag kar uttarkashi naam kaa ek ore jila bana diya
 The main reason for this is also the geographical conditions, it is the border district of Uttarakhand

 Uttarakhand was established on 9 November 2000 as a result of the reorganization of Uttar Pradesh as a new state
 isliye is din ko uttrakhand main sthapana diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 In the erstwhile state, 13 districts were included, of which 7 districts were in Garhwal and 6 districts in Kumau Mandal, which are as follows: Dehradun, Haridwar, Chamoli, Rudraprayag, Tehri Garhwal, Uttarkashi and Pauri Garhwal
 Kumau: Almora, Nainital, Pithoragarh
 , Udham Singh Nagar, Bageshwar, and Champawat
 The main basis of dividing all the districts is geographical

 As early as 1960, Jean Roddenberry drafted a proposal for a science fiction series, which later became Star Trek
 Although he publicly marketed him as a Westerner in outer space - the so-called "wagon Train to the Stars" - he privately told friends that he was actually building him based on Jonathan Swift's Gulliver Travels , Where each episode requires action on two levels: one as a hilarious thriller and one as a morality tale
 star treks kahaniyaan, aam taur par maanav or federation ke staraflit main sevarat anya grahvaasiyon ke saahasik kaaryon kaa varnan karti hai

 Issues depicted in various series include war and peace, personal allegiance, authoritarianism, imperialism, class warfare, economics, racism, religion, human rights, sexism and the role of feminism and technology
 Roddenberry said: "A new world with new rules, i could make statements about gender, religion, Vietnam, politics and intercontinental missiles
 In fact, we made them on Star Trek: we were sending messages and luckily everyone Found from the network

 He wanted Star Trek to show how humanity could develop further if he could learn something from the lessons of his past, especially by ending violence
 An extreme example is the Vulcans, who had a very violent past, but learned to control their emotions
 Their efforts were hampered to some extent by network concerns about marketability
 For example, he opposed Roddenberry's insistence on a racially diverse crew for the Enterprise, as opposed to the studio
 saanchaa:timeline of Star Trek franchise In 1964 Roddenberry produced the original Star Trek TV
 a proposal for the series was presented to desilu Studios as "wagon Train to the Stars"
 The show's first experimental episode, "the Cage", in which Jeffery Hunter played Enterprise Captain Chris Pike, was rejected by the network, however, desilu's executives were still influenced by the concept and he added a second pilot episode: Decided to make "where No Man Has Gone Before" an unusual decision

 The show's fanbase conducted an unprecedented letter-writing campaign, requesting NBC to keep the show running
 NBC renewed the show, but removed it from primetime, shifted it to the "friday Night Death Slot" and also significantly cut the budget
 Roddenberry reduced his direct involvement with Star Trek before the start of the season to protest the changed time slot, and was replaced by Fred Freiburger

 The popularity of syndicated Star Trek prompted Paramount Pictures and Roddenberry to develop a new Star Trek: Phase II series in May 1975
 shrinkhalaa par kaary ruk gaya, jab prastaavit paramount television seva band ho gai
 With the success of science fiction films Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the experimental episode of Phase II was adapted into the feature film Star Trek: The Motion Picture
 The film, released in North America on 7 December 1979, received mixed reviews from critics
 The film grossed $ 139 million worldwide, slightly below studio expectations, but enough to offer Paramount the sequel
 The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels
 In total, six Star Trek feature films were produced between 1979 and 1991

 Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, died on 24 October 1991 at the age of 70, due to a heart failure

 TNG ke paas star treks kii kisi bhi shrinkhalaa kii sarvocch reating thi or iske mul saat sizan prasaaran ke antim kuch varshon ke dauraan yah # 1 sindicated sho tha
 In response to tng's success, Paramount began producing Deep Space Nine as a spin-off of the Star Trek series, released in 1993
 Although the DS9 was not as popular as TNG, its rating was also quite solid and it also ran for seven seasons

 Increased audience interest in Star Trek, the concurrent broadcast of DS9 and Voyager and the release of three of four tng-based feature films in 1994, 1996 and 1998, reached the climax in the mid-1990s
 Voyager was the flagship show of the new United Paramount network and thus the first series to appear on a large network, following the original Star Trek
 It lasted seven seasons until 2001, making the show the longest running in the short history of UPN

 Enterprise did not receive high ratings like its predecessors, and by the third season of the series, UPN threatened to cancel Enterprise
 Fans began the campaign reminiscent of saving the third season of the original series

 Portions of the fourth season's story are often spread over two or three episodes

 video compresssont sorce koding kii avadharana tathaa soochna siddhant kaa ek udhaaharan he
 This article deals with applications of video compression: compressed video can effectively reduce the bandwidth it takes to transmit video, whether it is through broadcast on Earth, cable TV or satellite TV services
 adhikansh video compresssont hanipurna hote hai - yah is avadharana par aadhaarit he ki yah aavashyak nahin he ki sankuchan se pehle uplabdh adhikansh data bodhtmak rup se acchhee gunvattta ke liye aavashyak hi ho
 udhaaharan ke liye, dividi ek video koden maanak kaa upyog karata he jise empiiji-2 kaha jaataa he or jo 2 ghanton ke video data ko 15 se 30 guna sankuchit kar saktaa he or iske baad bhi jo chhavi gunvattta praapt hoti he vah saadhaaran vyakhya ke aadhaar par ucch gunvattta kii hi maani jaati he
 Video compression is a type of deal between disk space, video quality, and the cost of the hardware needed to remove compression from the video within a reasonable time
 haalanki, agar video hanipurna dhang se ati-sankuchit he, drishy vishisht lakshan prakat ho sakate hai
 Video compression typically operates on square groups of side-by-side pixels called macroblocks
 pixlon ke ye samooh yaa block kii agle frem se tulana karke video sankuchan codek dwaara sirf in blokon main parivartit pixel hi bheje jate hai
 It works very well if the video does not have motion
 udhaaharan ke liye text kaa ek gatiheen frem bahut kam sthanantarit data ke saath doharaaya ja saktaa he
 And in high-speed video, more pixels change from one frame to the next
 jab adhik picksal parivartit hote hai, video compresssont yojana ko badi sankhya main parivartansheel pixlon ko banaaye rakhane ke liye adhik maatra main data bhejnaa padataa he
 If there is an explosion in the video content, a flock of thousands of birds or any other similar image, including high-frequency details, etc
, either the quality will be reduced or the variable bitrate will have to be increased to maintain the quality, thereby increasing this The information provided can be supplied and the level of detail can be maintained
 isse pehle ki use vitaran pranali ko bheja jaye, programing pradaata apane video par lagu hone vaale compresssont kii maatra par niyantran karata he
 Video compression is performed on dvds, Blu-ray Discs, and HD dvds during the mastering process, although the compression on Blu-ray and HD dvds is limited due to the large amount of space on them, in contrast to stream video For example, on the Internet and cell phones, contractions are quite high
 hard drive yaa optical discs par video sanchit karne vaale software dwaara taiyaar video kii gunvattta adhikanshtah kam hoti he, haalanki sabhi maamalon main aisa nahin he
 High bitrate video codecs are available for post-production work, where the level of compression is very low or not, but the files obtained from them are very large, so they are not used as videos ready for distribution

 yadi ek baar atyadhik hanipurna compresssont ke saath video taiyaar ho jaye, jisamen chhavi kii gunvattta se samjhauta kiya gaya ho, to usase mul gunvattta vaale video kii chhavi praapt karnaa asambhav hota he
 The video is basically a three-dimensional table of colored pixels
 do aayam chalchitron ke sthanik nirdeshon kii poorti karte hai, tathaa teesraa aayam samay prakshetra ko nirupit karata he
 a data frame is a group of all pixels that are projected in a unit of time

 Video data includes spatial and temporal addition
 is prakaar samanta koden karne ke liye fremon ke bich ke antar tathaa fremon ke bich ke samyaantar ko panjibaddh kar liya jaataa he
 One is the fact that the human eye does not see small differences in color, but sees differences in brightness and takes advantage of this by spatial encoding, in which regions of similar colors are "averaged"
 
 When a large number of pixels are the same in a series of frames, only the pixels converted to spatial compression are coded
 data compresssont ke kuch rup hanirahit hote hai
 This means that when the data is decompressed, every bit between the result and the origin is the same
 yadhyapi video kaa haniheen compresssont sambhav he, iskaa prayog virale hi kiya jaataa he, kyoki hanipurna compresssont main sweekaarya gunvattta kahin adhik sankuchan anupaat ke saath praapt ho jaati he
 One of the most powerful techniques of video compression is interframe compression
 interfrem compresssont ek yaa adhik pichley athwa agle fremon kaa prayog vartmaan frem ke sankuchan ke liye karata he jabaki intrafrem compresssont sirf vartmaan frem ko hi sankuchit karata he, is prakaar yah ek prabhavi chhavi compresssont he
 The most popular method is to compress each frame by comparing it to the previous frame of the video
 yadi frem main kuch aise kshetra hai jahaan koi badlaav nahin aa rahaa ho, to compresssont pranali ek chota nirdesh dekar pichley frem se unhi hisson ko bit-waar dhang se agle main prayog kar leti he
 If parts of the frame are moving normally, the compressor adjusts the pattern by moving, rotating, lightening, or deepening the instructions - although it is still shorter than the intraframe
 interfrem compresssont un prograamon ke liye to acha kaary karata he jo darshak dwaara sirf dekhe jate hai, par yadi video ke hisse sampadit kiye jane hon, to yah compresssont samasya paidaa karata he
 Since data is copied from one frame to another in an interframe compression, if the original frame is lost, other frames based on it will not be created properly
 Some video formats, such as DV, compress each frame independently using intraframe compression
 intrafrem dwaara sankuchit video main 'cat' bananaa lagbhag utana hi aasaan he jitna ki asankuchit video kaa sampadan - iske liye sirf prakyek frem kaa prarambh tathaa ant khoj kar, un fremon ko jinhen rakhana chaahate hon, bit-waar dhang se copy kar liya jaayegaa, tathaa jinhen nahin rakhana ho, unhen tyaag diya jaayegaa
 intrafrem or interfrem compresssont ke bich ek or antar yah he ki intrafrem system main, prayek frem ke data kaa aakaar ek samaan hi hota he
 In most interframe systems some frames are not able to copy data from other frames so they require more data than other frames near them
 yah sambhav he ki aisa caputer aadhaarit video sampadan tul banaaya ja sake jo is pareshaani kaa pataa laga sake ki jab anya fremon ko ai frem kii aavashyaktaa ho, to use sampadit na kiya ja rahaa ho
 isaki vajah se hi sampadan ke liye prayog kiye jane vaale anya nae formats jaise echdivi ban paae hai
 However, this process requires far more computing power than editing an equivalent quality intraframe compress video
 aajkal lagbhag sabhi saamaanya rup se prayukt video compresssont prakriyaayein sthanik atiriktata ko kam karne ke liye discreet kaunsin transform kaa prayog karte hai
 Other methods, such as fractal compression, matching purse, and discrete wavelet transform, are currently the subject of research and have not yet been included in practical products
 People's interest in fractal compression is decreasing, this is because theoretical analysis has shown ineffectiveness in such methods

 Nagarjuna was a metallurgist and philosopher of India
 11veen shatabdi main al baruni ke dwaara likhe dastavejon ke anusaar ve 100 varsh pehle gujarat ke nikat daihak naamak gram main janme the
 That is, he was born in the early 10th century
 jabaki chini or tibeti sahitya ke anusaar ve 'vaideh desh' main janme the or paas ke satvahan vansh dwaara shasit kshetra main chale gayi the
 Apart from this, confusion continues between the philosopher Nagarjuna and Rasastri Nagarjuna of Mahayana sect in history
 maharashtra ke nagalvadi gram main unki prayogshaala hone ke pramaan mili hai
 According to some evidences, he was engaged in discovering the attainment of 'immortality' and had knowledge of the extraction of mercury and iron
 dwitiyak sahitya main bhi rasshasthri nagarjun ke bare main bahut hi bhram kii sthiti he
 It was previously believed that his famous work called Rasratnakar is his own scripture, but a 1984 study showed that another creator name came out in Rasratnakar's manuscript
 nagarjun kaa janm san 931 main gujarat main somnath ke nikat daihak naamak kile main hua tha
 He was a chemist Arthat Alchemist
 log unke bare main dher sari kahaniyaan kehete the
 He never had distraction or trouble with him
 is lok-vishwaas ko ki vah bhagwaan ke sandeshvahak hai, rasaratnakar naamak pustak likh kar pusht kar diya
 This book was written in the style of interaction between him and the gods
 rasaratnakar main ras banane ke prayog die gayi hai
 In this, a survey of the level of metallurgical and alchemy in the country was also given
 is pustak main chaandi, sona, tin or tambe kii kachi dhaatu nikaalane or use shuddh karne ke tareeke bhi bataaye gaye hai
 Nagarjuna also used animal and vegetable substances and acids and minerals to make mercury and other substances from mercury
 heere, dhaatu or moti gholne ke liye unhone vanaspati se bane tejaabon kaa suzav diya
 It contained sour porridge, plantains and fruit juices
 unhone or pehle ke kemiagaron ne jin upkarnon kaa istemaal kiya tha uski suchi bhi pustak main di gai he
 The book also has a description about distillation, liquefaction, uptake and roasting
 pustak main vistaarpurn diya gaya he ki anya dhaatuen sone main kaise badal sakati hai
 If not made of gold, such metals can be made by Rasagam Vishman whose yellow glow was similar to gold
 hingul or tin jaise kelmine se paare jaisi vastu banane kaa tarika diya gaya he
 Nagarjuna also wrote a book called ‘uttara Tantra’ to supplement the Sushruta Samhita
 isamen davaaiyaan banane ke tareeke diye gayi hai
 Also wrote 'arogyamanjari', a book of Ayurveda
 unki anya pustaken he- kakshaput tantra, yogasar or yogactak
 The following manuscripts are said to be composed by a 'nagarjuna' - yadhyapi 'rasaratnakar' naamak granth kaa rachayita rasayanashastri nagarjun ko hi mana jaataa rahaa he kintu 1984 main pandulipiyon evam print saamagree ke adhyayan se yah baat saamne aayi ki rasaratnakar kii pandulipi main kisi nityanath siddh kaa naam baar-baar uske rachanaakaar ke rup main aayaa he
 Ice dance is a form of physical skating, which came from the world of ballroom dancing
 pehali baar 1952 main world figure skating championships main isaki pratiyogita hui, par 1976 tak yah sheetakaaleen olympic khelon main padakwala khel nahin ban paaya
 In doubles skating, dancers compete as a couple with a male and a female participation
 barf nrity yugal skating se alag he, jisamen lifton ke liye alag-alag jaruratein hoti hai va ek-duusare ko pakadakar hone vaale nrity main ek team ke rup main ghumaav kii jarurat hoti he or is dauraan phenkane or uchhalane kii manaahi hoti he
 Typically, the pairs do not separate the length of the two arms by a distance, whereas originally the couples were to hold each other and dance throughout the event, although the modern ice dance has lifted this restriction to some extent
 barf nrity or skating kii duusari vidhaon ke bich ek or antar pradarshan ke dauraan sangeet kaa upyog he; barf nrity main nartak ko hameshaa sangeet ke mutabik hi sket karnaa hota he, jisaki ek nishchit dhun yaa lay hoti he
 Singles and doubles skaters often skate according to the song and a particular style of its music, not according to its rhythm, while in ice dancing it is severely punished
 kuch gaiyr-isu pratiyogitaaon main ekal nartak bhi pratispardhaa kar sakate hai
 Ice dance competitions have two components: 'short dance ") and free dance")
 mukt nrity kaa scoring main adhik mahatv hota he or iskaa ek tibraker ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 By the end of the 2009–10 season, competitions included one or more compulsory dance "), original dance") and free dance

 One or more obligatory dances were performed as competitions for the first stage of the ice dance, but they are popular among skaters as a form of recreational or social dance
 adhikansh nrityon ke liye pattern rink ke aadhe yaa puure circuit ko cover karne vaale hote hai
 The International Skating Union will tell about the mandatory dances, which will be performed before each season and the compulsory dances will be prepared later for specific events
 2010 ke sijan ke baad anivaary nrity sabhi ISU pratiyogitaaon main band kar diye gayi
 The 2010 World Figure Skating Championship competition was the last event to include a mandatory dance, and Italy's Federica Fália and Massimo Scali were the last teams to perform in the competition
 mul nrity nrity pratiyogitaaon ke teen bhaagon kaa doosraa hissaa tha
 Every year the ISU sets a rhythm or set of rhythms for the original dance, according to which, or as a folk dance, all the arguments are to be performed according to a specific theme
 pratiyogiyon ko apane sangeet or nrity ke chayan anumati di gai
 The length of the program was shorter than in free dance and skaters had to follow more rules

 haalanki, 1990 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main sabhi sheersh nrity dalon kii pradarshan dincharya bollroom style se zyada natya style vaali thi
 During this time, the International Skating Union first attempted to return to its ballroom roots by controlling more theatricality in the ice dance by placing more restrictions on music and dance hold
 baad main, jab yah shikaayat mili ki barf nrity kaaphi ubaau ho gaya he to in pratibandhon ko hataa diya gaya or uski jagah par waisi aavashyaktaaon ko shaamil kiya gaya ki nartak mul nrity or mukt nrity main kuch nirdisht takneekee tatwon ko shaamil kar saken
 iskaa asar yah hua ki ab nirnay karne main naatakeeyata par kam takanic or mallavritti par adhik jor diya jaataa he
 Even though the need for dancers to skate to music with a certain tune is still intact, ice dance is currently the only mode that allows for instrumental music to accompany the song in the competition key

 SI ko 1960 main puraani meter-kilogram-sacond yani pranali se viksit kiya gaya tha, bajaay centimetre-gram-sacond pranali kii, jisamen kai kathinaaiyaan thim
 The SI system does not remain stable, but it continues to evolve, but units are created and changed only through international agreements

 But exceptions are the United States and Britain, where non-si units still have their old systems

 Along with this, new money was also introduced here, which was based on the decimal system itself
 is pranali main kai nai namakaran kii gai ikaiyaan lagu hui
 There are seven basic units in this system and many other derived units
 kuch vaigyanik or saanskrithik kshetron main es ai pranali ke saath anya ikaiyaan bhi prayog main laai jaati hai
 It is easy to express very small and very large quantities through SI prefixes
 kisi ikai kii paribhaasha or karyanvan ke bich antar mahatvapurn he
 The definition of each SI root unit has been carefully designed to be unique and unique, and at the same time presents a solid theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made

 How definitions of certain critical units are implemented is given on the BIPM website
 An SI derived unit unique form is defined only as SI root units

 On April 7, 1795, gramme and kilogramme replaced the old terminology "gravet" and "grave"
 10 disambar, 1799 ko, metric pranali ko sthai rup se france main apanaaya gaya
 The metric system being used around the world has seen many changes today

 Based on the results of this study, the Tenth CGPM decided in 1954 to derive an international system from six basic units that could provide measurements of mechanical and electromagnetic quantities as well as temperature and optical radiation

 In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units or the International System of Units, abbreviated as SI, originally from French: Le Système international d'unités
 The seventh parent unit, the mole or the mole, was added to the 14th CGPM in 1971

 intaraashtriya ikai pranali main ikaayiyon kaa samooh he, jiske sadash hi upsargon ke samooh bhi hai
 SI units can be divided into two subgroups: - in ikaayiyon ke saath hi To create multiples of the root unit, the SI prefix can be added
 sabhi gunak das kii purna sankhya ghaat ke hai
 For example, kilo- = sahasra or thousand milli - = thousandth part i

 one meter has one hazards millimeters, plus one thousand meters to one kilometer
 upsargon ko milaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 a milligram is a millionth of a kilogram, but it will not be called a micro-kilogram

 Transfer factors are used to transfer between units

 Specific gravity is often represented in SI units, or in the context of water
 kyonki ek ghan jiske naap hai 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, uski aaytan hogi 1000 cm3, jo baraabar he 1 l ke; or jab jal se bharaa jaye, to uskaa bhaar 1 kg hota he, atev pani kii spacific gravity he 1 g / cm3 or yah 0 degree celsius par jam jaayegaa
 The metric system has received worldwide support as a means of means and daily commerce
 iskaa kaaran bahut had tak yah bhi tha ki kai deshon main rudhigat pranaaliyon main kai siddhanton ko samajhane kaa samarthy nahin thi
 At the same time, by standardizing regional changes, a world-wide system, which is universally accepted, was created
 isse anterrashtriya vyapaar ko bhi badhaava mila
 From a scientific point of view, the use of decimal can also be described as very large and very small units

 In many cases this change is BIPM
 Is also valid by Some examples include: The European Union has given a directive that prohibits the sale of non-si marked goods from 31 December 2009 onwards

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 Currency war, also known as competitive devaluation, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade over profit by other countries in relation to the decline in their currency of the exchange rate of other currencies
 
 As the exchange rate falls the currency of one country, exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports in the country become more and more expensive

 " At a G-20 meeting issued on February 15, finance ministers and central bank governors in Moscow said that Japan would not face high levels of international criticism for its planned monetary policy
 Supported by a comment in the US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said that there had recently been concerns about a possible currency war, "overblown"
 Paul Krugman echoed Eichengreen's view that the central bank's unconventional monetary policy is best understood as a shared concern to promote growth, not as the currency war
 Goldman Sachs strategist Kamakshya Trivedi suggested that rising stock market means market players generally agree that central bank actions are best understood as monetary easing and not competitive devaluation
 Other analysts believe, however, that continued to emphasize the ongoing tensions over currency valuations remain, with currency wars and even trade wars still a significant risk

 Since September 2014, many journalists, commentators and financial sector insiders again raised the possibility of currency war ahead
 This time, instead of being intended as a means to promote competition, some states, notably Japan and the Eurozone, may have a means to induce devaluation of their currencies
 To combat the danger of deflation
 ECB President Mario Draghi has however denied any intention to engage in competitive devaluation

 The competitive devaluation of both the 1930s episode and the outbreak began in the global economic downturns that occurred during 2009
 The period of 2010s with a significant difference is that international traders are much better able to hedge their risk due to exchange rate fluctuations and more sophisticated financial markets
 a second difference is that later period devaluations have always been influenced by nations to expand their money supply — either by making money to buy foreign currency, in the case of direct intervention, or by making money
 With its domestic economies to inject into, there is quantitative easing

 chaar main se do siton par shiad ummidavaar bhaajapa ke chunaav chinh camel kaa prayog karenge
 Number of seats mat pratishat The induction motor is a alternating current motor whose angular speed of the rotor is less than the angular speed of the rotational magnetic field produced by the stator winding
 isi kaaran is motor ko 'atulykaalik motor' kaha jaataa he 
 This is called the 'induction motor' because the current is generated by induction in its rotor because the speed of the rotor and rotational magnetic field are different
 yah motor sabase adhik upyog main aata he jiske kaaran ise udyogon kaa workehorse kehete hai
 There is no wear-resistant component so that it can last for many days without repair
 yah kai prakaar kaa hota he- Most motors used in homes for general tasks and low power are single-phase induction motors, also known as fractional horsepower motors
 udhaaharan ke liye pankhons, dhulaai kii mashiinon ke motor aadi
 Reverse current motors also have field coils and armatures similar to direct current motors, but in some different form
 inamen do mukhya bhaag hote hai : ek to stater, jo sthir rahata he or doosraa roter jo ghumta he
 Reverse current motors are also of different types
 sabase-saamaanya prayavarti dhara motor preran motor he, jo preran ke siddhant par kaary karata he
 In induction motors, the stator coiling is associated with the triplet capacitance, causing a rotational magnetic field
 roter ke chaalak aapas main trikleey kundalan ke rup main bhi ho sakate hai, jo donon siron par taanbe ke valay dwaara laghu paripathit hon
 Such a composition is, in effect, like a squirrel's cage
 at: aise motaron ko saamanyat: 'gilahari panjar preran motor', athwa keval 'panjar motor' hi kehete hai
 These motors are very strong in design as well as are simple and cheap
 inaki dakshata bhi usee aakaar ke duusare motaron kii apeksha unchi hoti he
 Hence the use of these motors is often universal
 parantu in motaron kaa prachaalan, ek prakaar se, roter kii banaavat se anusaar nishchit hota he or usamen aavashyaktaa ke anusaar parivartan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Their initial force is very low, which is necessary to insert some resistance in the rotor circuit to improve, but this is not possible due to the formation of stable type
 saath hi sthaayee taur par roter chaalkon kaa pratirodh bhi adhik nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki aisa karne par haani adhik bad jaaegi or motor kii dakshata ghat jaaegi
 In order to achieve more initial, forced bipeder motors are used, which have two toes instead of one
 roter ke khaanchon ke praroop tathaa unki sthiti ke anusaar prachaalan lakshanon main kuch vibhinnata praapt kii ja sakati he or unhen vividh prayojanon ke yogya banaaya ja saktaa he
 The synchronous speed ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} of an AC motor is the speed of the rotational magnetic field of its stator
 iskaa maan nimnlikhit sutara se nikaala ja saktaa he- Where f { \ displaystyle f} is the frequency of supply of the motor and p { \ displaystyle p} is the number of magnetic poles, for example, 50 Hz supply and, for a 6-pole three-phase motor, p { \ displaystyle p} = 6 and ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} = 1,000 RPM slip s { \ displaystyle s} ko praayah nimnlikhit prakaar se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he- Where ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} synchronous speed, nr { \ displaystyle n_ {r}} the rotor speed if the rotor is moving at synchronous speed, the value of slip will be zero if the rotor is not moving at all
 The value will be 1
 motor dwaara utpann balaghurna kaa maan uske roter kii slip par nirbhar karata he
 Which is called 'slip-torque specification'
 spasht he ki preran motor 'lagbhag' sthir chaal par chalate hai
 Their gait variance is very less with weight
 at:, jin bhaaron ke liye sthir chaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, vahaan ve bahut upyogi hote hai
 However, motor motors are not commonly used where variable speed is required
 inaki chaal tulykaalik chaal se kuch hi kam hoti he, jo dhruv sankhya tathaa aavriti par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, to move around, it is necessary to either change the pole number, or to vary the frequency
 aavriti vicharan karne kaa taatpary he ki alag aise sambharan kii vyavastha karnaa jisaki aavriti badali ja sake
 Nowadays variable frequency drives are coming for this
 dhruv sankhya ko ek vishisht anupaat main, kundalan ke sambandhan main parivartan karke badla ja saktaa he, jaise ek 4 dhruvi motor ko 8 dhruvi athwa 6 dhruvi motor main parivartit karnaa sambhav he
 Thus the velocities corresponding to these pole numbers can also be obtained
 50 chakree aavriti par 4 dhruvi motor kii tulykaalik chaal 1,500 RPM or 6 dhruvi tathaa 8 dhruvi kaa kramash: 1,000 tathaa 750 RPM he
 In this way, by changing the pole number of such motor, its speed can be obtained
 par ye keval do yaa teen kramon main hi ho sakate hai
 By this method it is not possible to get the variance in a wide range
 kuch nishchit kramon main chaal vicharan kii ek duusari vidhi "sopanipat niyantran" kehalaati he
 This method is mostly used in rolling mills
 vibhinn prakaar ke mashin aujaaron main bhi vicharanshil chaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, parantu unamem saamanyat:, chaal vicharan giyar kramon ko badalakar kiya jaataa he

 autotransafarmar ek aisi sanrachana vaala transafarmar hota he jisamen keval ek hi vinding hoti he
 Some parts of the same winding act as primary and some parts work as second winding
 at: is akeli vinding main kam se kam teen vidyutiya sire hote hai
 Such transformer is smaller in size and weight than normal transformer with similar KVA rating
 kintu isamen primary or secondari ke bich isolation nahin miltaa jo kahin-kahin anivaary rup se aavashyak hoti he
 An autotransformer has only one winding with two or more terminals in the middle of the two ends
 primary ko do antim chhoron ke bich lagaaya jaataa he
 The output voltage is taken between a terminal and an end terminal
 is transformar kii puri vinding ke prayek turn main samaan voltage hota he, chaahe vah turn primary main ho yaa secondari main
 In autotransformer, some current from the primary moves the load directly
 v 1 v 2 = n 1 n 2 = a { \ displaystyle { \ frac {V_{1}}{V_{2}}}={ \ frac {n_{1}}{n_{2}}}=a} The ampere-turns provided by the upper half: f u = i 1 = n 1 i 1 { \ displaystyle F_{U}=I_{1}=N_{1}I_{1}} The ampere-turns provided by the lower half: f l = n 2 = n 1 a { \ displaystyle F_{L}=N_{2}={ \ frac {n_{1}}{a}}} For ampere-turn balance, FU = FL: n 1 i 1 = n 1 a { \ displaystyle N_{1}I_{1}={ \ frac {n_{1}}{a}}} Therefore: i 1 i 2 = 1 a { \ displaystyle { \ frac {I_{1}}{I_{2}}}={ \ frac {1}{a}}} The size of an autotransformer is smaller than a two-way transformer of the same size
 ye bhi autotransformar hi hote hai lekin isamen output ek niyat bindu se nahin liya gaya hota he balki vinding par phisalkar chalane vaale ek carbon brush ke madhyam se liya gaya hota he
 This has the advantage that any voltage can be achieved within a range in the output
 is kaaran iskaa upyog anek yuktiyon ke pareekshan main hota he
 For example, it can be used to light a bulb less or more intensively than necessary
 isi tarah iskaa upyog motor ko 'soft sturt' karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 By controlling its brush automatically, a voltage-stabilizer is also made from it
