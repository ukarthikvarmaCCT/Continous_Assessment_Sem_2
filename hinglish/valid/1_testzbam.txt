 Traffic signs or road signs are signs placed along the roads to provide information to road users
 pichley aath dashakon main vaahanon kii sankhya main vruddhi ke saath kai deshon ne antarrashtriya yatra ko suvidhajanak banane tathaa aam taur par yatayaat suraksha ko badhaane main madad ke liye sachitr sanketon ko apanaaya he yaa anyathaa apane sanketon ko sarlikrut or manakikrut kiya he
 Such illustrated signs use symbols in place of words and are generally based on international protocols
 aise sanketon ko sabase pehle europe main viksit kiya gaya tha or inhen adhakansh deshon dwaara vibhinn staron par apanaaya gaya he
 Traffic signals can be divided into several types
 udhaaharan ke liye, sadak sambandhi chihnon or sanketon par vienna sammelan kii anusuchee 1, jahaan 30 june 2004 ko 52 hastaksharkarta desh shaamil the, in sanketon kii aath shreniyon ko paribhaashit karti he: Signs in the US, Canada and Australia are classified as follows: sanyukt rajya america main yatayaat ke sanketon or footpath ke chihnon ke liye shreniyon, sthaan or graphic maanakon ko fedral haive administration ke minial on uniform trephic control divices main maanak ke rup main vaidhanik taur par paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 a relatively informal difference in directional signals is the difference between advance directional signals, exchanged directional signals, and assurance signals
 advance dishaatmak sanket prayek disha kii jaankaree dete hue interchange sanketon se ek nishchit duuri par dikhaai dete hai
 Many countries do not provide information for the road ahead, but only the left and right directions
 agrim dishaatmak sanket chaalkon ko nikasi ke liye saavdhaanee baratane main sakasham banaate hai 
 ye aksar choti sadakon par nahin dikhaai dete hai lekin aam taur par inhen express-ve or motor-ve par lagaaya jaataa he kyonki inke bagaiyr chaalak nikasi ko bhul jaaenge
 haalanki har desh kii apni khud kii ek pranali hoti he, ek motor-ve nikasi ke liye pratham pahunch sambandhi sanket adhikanshtah vaastavik interchange se kam se kam 1000 meter kii duuri par lagaaya jaataa he
 That signal is then followed by one or two additional advance directional signals, especially before the actual interchange
 sabase pehle ke sadak sanket mile ke pathar ke rup main hote the jo duuri or disha kii jaankaree dete the; udhaaharan ke liye, roman log apane sampurna samrajya main rome se duuri ko nirdeshit karne vaale pattharon kii panktiyaan khadi karte the
 In the Middle Ages, multi-direction signs at intersections became common, giving directions for cities and towns
 bade paimaane par lagaae gaye pehle aadhunik sadak sanketon ko 1870 ke dashak ke uttararddh main or 1880 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main oonche yaa "saadhaaran" cycle kii sawari karne waalon ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 These machines were fast, quiet and difficult to control, apart from these, their riders traveled long distances and often preferred to travel on unknown roads
 is tarah ke savaaron ke liye cycle chaalak sanghathanon ne sthanon ke liye sirf duuri or dishaao kii jaankaree dene vaale sanketon kii bajaay aage ke sambhavit khataron kii chetavanee dene vaale sanketon ko lagaana shuru kiya, jisase sanketon kaa ek aisa prakaar viksit hua jo "aadhunik" yatayaat sanketon ko paribhaashit karata he
 The development of motor vehicles promoted more complex signaling systems that used more than just letter-based information
 aadhunik-samay ke sabase pehle sadak sanketak pranaaliyon main se ek 1895 main italvi touring club dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 In 1900, proposals for standardization of street signaling were considered at a congress of the International League of Touring Organizations in Paris
 1903 main british sarkaar ne akruti par aadhaarit chaar "rashtriya" sanketon kii shuruyaat kii lekin zyaadaatar sadak sanketon kii moulik paddatiyon ko rome main yojit 1908 ke international road congress main nirdhaarit kiya gaya
 In 1909, nine European governments agreed to use four pictorial signs directing "bump" "bend", "intersection" and "grade-level railroad crossing"
 1926 or 1949 ke bich antarrashtriya sadak sanketon par kiye gaye gahan adhyayan se antat europea sadak sanket pranali kaa vikaas hua
 Both Britain and the United States developed their own road indicator systems, both of which were adopted or adapted by many other countries in their respective jurisdictions
 britain ne 1964 main europea sadak sanketon ke ek sanskaran ko apanaaya or pichley dashakon main uttar america chetavanee sanketak ne kuch sanketon or graphics ko angreji ke saath milakar upyog karnaa shuru kiya
 This change was gradual over the years
 purv-audyogic sanket pathar yaa lakdi ke hote the, lekin coke kaa upyog kar lohe ko galane kii darbi kii vidhi ke vikaas ke saath atharahavin sadi ke uttararddh or unnisvin main paint kiye gaye dhalwaan lohe ko pasand kiya jane laga
 Cast iron continued to be used until the middle of the twentieth century, but was gradually replaced by aluminum or other materials and processes such as glass lacquered and / or pressurized iron or steel
 1945 ke baad se zyaadaatar sanketon ko aluminium kii chadar par chipakane vaali plastic kii parat kaa istemaal kar banaaya gaya he, ye raat ke samay or kam-roshni kii drishyata ke liye aam taur par retroriflactive hote hai
 Prior to the development of reflective plastics, reflectivity was provided by using glass reflectors in handwriting and signs
 electronic pradarshan par aadhaarit yatayaat sanketon kii nayi peediyaan automatic trephic sensoron yaa remote minial input se judi "chatur niyantran " pradaan karne ke liye apni likhaawat ko badal bhi sakati hai
 Warnings of real-time traffic message channel activity in more than 20 countries are routed directly to vehicle monitoring systems using FM radio, 3G cellular data, and voiceless signals via satellite transmissions
 ant main video number-plate scanning kaa istemaal kar gaadiyaan path-kar kaa bhugtan kar sakati hai or trek suraksha jaanch vyavastha se hokar guzar sakate hai, yaa on-board siganling, path-kar sangrah or yatra ke samay kii nigaraanee ke samarthan main sadakon par antina se jude windshields main rfidi transponders kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Another "medium" for transferring information commonly associated with direct signals is RIAS, such as "speaking signals" for people unable to read handwriting
 uttar america, australia or newjiland ke rangon ke arth aam taur par is prakaar hai: The American Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices dictates four other colors: kabhi-kabhi viniamak sanketon ko bhi laal yaa kaale sanketon par safed aksharon ke saath dekha jaataa he
 In Quebec, blue is often used for tourist attractions and brown for public services such as restrooms; White-on-red color is used instead of yellow-on-black signs in many places
 kai america rajyon or canadai praanton main ab fluoroscent naarangi rang kaa upyog nirmaan sambandhi sanketon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Each state and province has different markings for their own highways, but they all use standard signs for federal highways
 kai vishesh rajmargon - jaise ki queen elizabeth maarg, trans-canada haive or america main vibhinn auto trails - main vishisht sanketon kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 a five-pointed blue sign with yellow letters is sometimes used for numbered county routes in American counties, although this experiment is inconsistent within states
 yatayaat sanketon par dooriyaan aam taur par sambandhit desh ke dwaara prayog kii jane vaali maapak pranali kaa paalan karti hai
 Most U
S
 road signs use the "U
S
 Customary Units" system of Miles or Yards, although the federal Department of Transportation has developed metric standards for all signs
 united kingdom ke sanketon main bhi duriyon ko milon main dikhaaya jaataa he
 Metric distances are widely used in other places, although this is not universal
 jahaan sanketon main kisi bhashaa kaa prayog hota he, vahaan aam taur par us kshetra kii manyata praapt bhashaa / bhashaaon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Most signs in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are in English
 cuebek vaasi francisi bhashaa kaa upyog karte hai, jabaki montrial main new burnsvik, jaik-cartier or champlen brijes angareji or francisi donon bhashaaon kaa prayog karte hai, saath hi kai anya praanton or rajyon, jaise ki ontario, manitoba or varmont main kuch khaas kshetron main francisi-angareji dubhashiya sanketon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he

 Road signs in the capital region of Brussels occur in French and Dutch
 finland main sanket finnish or swedish bhashaa main hai
 In Germany and Austria the signs are in the German language

 ab yah emutisidi ke sah-sanskaran, standard haive scince kaa hissaa he jo sanketakritiyon ke liye sampurna dizin kaa vivaran detaa he
 Initially, all alphabet series were made up of only uppercase letters and numbers, although shs's year 2000 review provided lowercase extensions for each alphabet series
 shrinkhalaa bi se lekar shrinkhalaa epa tak kii utpatti ek samaan naam vaali varnmaala shrinkhalaaon se hui jinaki shuruyaat 1927 main hui thi
 The straight-stroke letters in the 1927 series later became similar to their modern counterparts, but used glyphs for characters such as B, C, D, etc
