ek ek kar raja sabakuch haarane lagate hai
 And there comes a time when kings lose everything
 shart ke hisaab se raja ko ab apana raaj paat chhodana he
 Leaving the Raj Pats, they move towards the west
 raja kii aisi durdasha dekhakar bhagwaan brahma sadhu ke vesh main unke paas aate hai or kuch sikke dekar kehete hai ki jaao ek baar jua khelo tumhaara raaj-paat waapas ho jayega
 Kings do this
 is baar mehara haarane lagata he
 He loses six times
 ab uske paas haarane ke liye kuch bhi nahin bachaa he
 Has also lost his wife
 lekin uski patni garbhvatee he
 And for the seventh time he also loses his wife's womb
 badi vicitra baat he
 But kings show leniency
 kehete hai ki agar betaa hua to astabal main kaam karegaa
 If she had a daughter, she would be appointed to the service of the queen
 haara hua mehara kuch nahin kar paata
 But the story comes at a strange turn here
 mehara ke saatvin santan ke rup main ek badi hi adbhut bacchee kaa janm hota he
 The name is called Manjari
 raja ko jab pataa chalata he to wo manjari ko livane ke liye sipaahi ko bhejte hai
 But Manjari's mother refuses to send him
 manjari kii maa raja ko sandesh bhijwati he ki jab manjari kii shaadi ho jaaegi to uske pati ko markar manjari ko le janaa
 The king accepts this
 dekhte hi dekhte manjari jawan bhi ho jaati he
 Then the parents start worrying about his marriage
 manjari ko pataa he ki uskaa var koun he
 Who is the one who can defeat the king after marriage? manjari apane maa baap se kahati he ki aap log baliya naam kii jagah par jaao
 a young man named Lorik will be found there
 usase mere janmon kaa naata he or vahi raja ko haraa bhi sakegaa
 Manjari's father goes to Lorik's house and their relationship is fixed
 loric dedh lakh baratiyon ko lekar manjari se shaadi karne nikalataa he
 Son arrives on this bank of the river, but the king arrives to fight him with his soldiers
 yuddh main loric haarane lagata he
 Manjari is an extraordinary girl
 wo loric ke paas jaati he
 It tells him that there is a village named Gothani near this fort of Agori
 vahaan bhagwaan shiv kaa ek mandir he
 You go worship God
 is yuddh main jeet tumhaari hi hogi
 Lorik wins
 donon kii shaadi hoti he
 Manjari farewell
 lekin gaanv kii dahalij chhodane se pehle wo loric se kahati he ki kuch aisa karo jisase yahaan ke log yaad rakhen ki loric or manjari kabhi is had tak pyaar karte the
 Lorik says tell me what to do if we become a token of our love, no loving couple returns from here
 manjari ne loric ko ek pathar dikhaate hue kaha ki ise talwaar ke ek hi waar se kaat do
 Lorik did the same
 par ek nai samasya aa gai
 The stone was broken into two pieces
 lekin uskaa ek hissaa pahaad se neeche gir gaya
 Manjari said that cut the stone such that both its parts stand in the same place
 loric ne aisa hi kiya
 And they have been standing here since the time of stone

 kathboli yaa slang kisi bhashaa yaa boli ke un anaupchaarik shabdon or vaakyanshon ko kehete hai jo bolne vaale kii bhashaa yaa boli main maanak to nahin maane jate lekin bolchaal main sweekaarya hote hai
 Linguists believe that puppets have always existed in every standard language, and almost everyone uses them
 aksar ek hi bhashaa samudaay ke vibhinn virgon kii apni bhinn kathboliyaan hoti hai or kisi vyakti dwaara kathboli kaa prayog uskaa kisi vishesh varg main sadsyta kaa sanket hota he
 For example, a Hindi-speaking policeman from Delhi is called 'thulla' in slang while in Mumbai she is called 'mama'
 kabhi-kabhi kathboli bahut lambe arase tak maanak bhashaa kaa bhaag na hote hue bhi prachlit rah sakati he, masalan samaaj ke kuch virgon main thanedaar yaa darogaa ke liye 'thulla' shabd kathboli ke rup main punjab kshetra ke kuch samudaayon main san 1880 main bhi prachlit paaya gaya tha
 Slang is also often used as euphemisms when the standard word for something is considered offensive or derogatory to hear, for example 'urine' is called 'susu' in many Hindi-speaking slang
 kabhi-kabhi yah bataanaa kathin hota he ki koi shabd maanak bhashaa kaa bhaag he yaa kathboli he
 The linguists Bethany Dumas and Jonathan Lighter listed some signs of slang for a word or phrase that slang is probably if a word has at least two of these characteristics: kathboli kisi vyavsaayik kshetra main boli jane vaali visheshgy boli se alag hoti he
 Classification is the technical terminology of a particular profession and its words meet only the second criterion from the list above, so slang cannot be called, although they can be used to keep a person outside the profession separate from the group
 
 kuch kathboliyon kaa prayog keval ek vishesh kshetra main hota he, udaharantah fiji hindi main 'kya' kii jagah kabhi-kabhi 'konchi' bolaa jaataa he, jo 'koun chiz' kaa sikuda rup he
 In contrast slang nouns are often associated with a particular subculture such as music or video games rather than territory
 phir bhi kathboli kii abhivyaktiyaan apane vaastavik kshetron se baahar jaakar "kool" or "jive" kii tarah aam taur par istemaal karne laayak ho sakati hai
 While some words eventually lose their status as slang, the use of other words continues to be treated in a similar way by most speakers
 jab kathboli mul rup se iskaa istemaal karne vaale samooh yaa up-samskruti se pare nikal jaati he to iske vaastavik upyogkarta samooh kii pahchaan ko kaayam rakhane ke liye isaki jagah duusare, kam-manyata praapt shabdon kaa prayog karne lagate hai
 One use of slang is to circumvent social prohibitions as mainstream language tries to shy away from appropriating certain realities
 isi kaaran se kathboli kii shabdaawaliyaan kuch khaas kshetra jaise ki hinsa, aparaadh, drugs or sex main vishesh rup se samrudh hai
 Alternatively, slang can only get out of familiarity with the things described
 udhaaharan ke liye californian sharaab ke kadaradaanon main se caburnet sauviganon ko aksar "cab so" ke rup main, cardone ko "card" ke rup main or isi tarah se janaa jaataa he; iskaa matlab yah he ki alag-alag sharaabon kaa namakaran iske anaavashyak prayog ko kam karata he; saath hi yah sharaab ke saath upyogkarta ke apanepan ko darshane main bhi madad karata he
 Even in a language community, slang and the extent to which it is used vary widely across social, ethnic, economic and geographic areas
 kathboli kaaphi samay ke baad prayog se baahar ho ja sakati he; haalanki kabhi-kabhi iskaa prayog adhik se adhik saamaanya ho jaataa he jab tak ki yah kuch kehane kaa ek prabhaavshaalee tarika nahin ban jaataa he, jab aam taur par ise mukhyadhara kii sweekaarya bhashaa ke rup main samajha jane lagata he, haalanki nishedhaatmak shabdon ke maamle main aisi koi abhivyakti nahin bhi ho sakati he jise mukhyadhara yaa sweekaarya bhashaa samajha jaataa ho
 Many slang words enter informal mainstream dialogue and sometimes in formal dialogue, although this can also include a change in meaning or usage
 kathboli main aksar maujuuda shabdon ke liye aupnyasik arthon kaa srijan shaamil hota he
 It is common for those novel meanings to diverge substantially from the standard meaning
 is prakaar 'kool' or 'hot' donon kaa matlab "bahut acha," "prabhaavshaalee," yaa "sundar" ho saktaa he
 Slang words are often known to be used only within a group or intergroup
 udhaaharan ke liye lit mul rup se keval kuch vishesh internet up-samskritiyon jaise ki pataakhon or online video gamers ke bich lokapriy the
 However, during the 1990s and in the early 21st century, lit has begun to take more and more common space on the Internet and has now spread beyond Internet-based dialogue and conversational languages
 kathboli ke anya prakaaron main shaamil hai mobile phone par istemaal hone vaali esemes kii bhashaa or "chatspea," ", jo "jor se hansane" yaa "joardaar hansee" yaa aroefel, "hansate-hansate jameen par lot janaa" kaa ek vipareet arth he), jiskaa istemaal internet par twarit samvaad bhejne ke liye vyapak rup se kiya jaataa he
 Some linguists make a distinction between the use of slang and the use of slang
 ghilad jukarman ke anusaar "kathboli kaa sandarbh ek vishisht saamaajik samooh, udhaaharan ke liye kishoron, sainikon, kaidiyon or choron dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale anaupchaarik shabdic samagriyon se he
 Slang is not the kind of colloquial language that is an informal, easy dialect used by the speaker on some occasion; Which may include words such as "yours" and the use of other colloquial words
 The use of common colloquial is a lexical material used in informal dialect whereas in the broad sense "colloquial" terminology may include slang use, not in its narrow sense
 kathboli kaa prayog aksar bolchaal kii bhashaa main kiya jaataa he lekin sabhi bolchaal kii bhashaayen kathboli nahin hoti hai
 One way to do between slang and colloquial language is to ask if most local speakers understand the term; If they do, then it is a colloquial language
 haalanki samasya yah he ki yah ek alag, pramaathran pranali nahin he balki ek nirantarata kii pranali he
 However, most slang are short-lived and often used by newcomers, some of which achieve non-slang colloquial status as 'bliss, fortune' and the first name of a Jewish woman, Zelda) and even a formal position "

 yah guphaayen ajanta naamak gaanv ke sannikat hi sthit he, jo ki maharashtra ke aurangabad jile main he
 Ajanta Caves have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983
 " According to "national Geographic": The flow of faith was such that almost all Buddhist temples, including Ajanta for centuries, seem to have been built under the rule and shelter of Hindu kings

 The village is 106 km away from Aurangabad city of Maharashtra

 In the foothills of this valley, the hill stream Vaghur flows

 Their elevation from the river ranges from 35 to 110 feet

 The first phase is mistakenly called the Hinayana phase, which is related to the Hinayana faith of Buddhism
 vastutah hinayan sthaviravaad ke liye ek shabd he, jisamen buddha kii moort rup se koi nishedh nahin he
 Ajanta's cave numbers 9, 10, 12, 13 15A were discovered at this stage
 in khudaayiyon main buddha ko stupa yaa math rup main darshit kiya gaya he
 Second phase excavations were discovered after nearly three centuries of stability
 is charan ko bhi galat rup main mahayan charan 9 buddha dharm kaa doosraa bada dhada, jo ki kamatar kattar he, evam buddha ko sidhe gaay aadi rup main chitron yaa shilpon main darshit karne kii anumati detaa he
 ) Many people call this phase Vakataka phase
 yah vatsagulm shakha ke shasit vansh vaakatak ke naam par he
 The construction date of this second phase is disputed among many academics
 haal ke varshon main kuch bahumat ke sanket ise paanchavin shatabdi main maanane lage hai
 According to Walter M
 Spink, an Ajanta expert, the Mahayan caves were built between 462–480 AD
 mahayan charan kii guphaayen sankhya hai 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, evam 29
 Cave number 8 was considered a cave of Hinayana phase for a long time, but at present it has been declared as Mahayan on the basis of facts
 mahayan, hinayan charan main do chaityagrih mili the, jo gupha sankhya 9 va 10 main the
 The cave numbers of this phase are 12, 13, 15 viharas
 mahayan charan main teen chaityas grih the jo sankhya 19, 26, 29 main the
 From the very beginning, the last cave was uninhabited
 anya sabhi mili guphaayen 1-3, 5-8, 11, 14-18, 20-25, va 27-28 vihaar hai
 The viharas found in the excavation are of several sizes, the largest being 52 feet, almost all square
 inke rup main bhi bhinnata he
 Many are simple, many are ornate, some are made of pavilions, and many are not
 sabhi viharon main ek aavashyak ghatak he— ek vrahat haul cameraa
 Among the Vakataka stages, many have not had holy places, because they were made only for religious gatherings and accommodation; Later holy places were added to them
 phir to yah ek maanak ban gaya
 The statue of Buddha in a central hall in this sacred place was often seated in the dharma-chakra-pramana posture
 jin gufaaon main naveenatam visheshtaayen hai, vahaan kinare kii deevaaron, dwaar mandapon par or praangan main gaun pavitra sthal bhi bane dikhte hai
 The walls of many viharas are decorated with carvings
 deevaaron or chhaton par bhitti chithran kiya hua he
 With the difference in Buddhist thought in the first century, Buddha was given the status of a deity and worshiped him
 parinamtah buddha ko puja-archana kaa kendra banaaya gaya; jisase mahayan kii utpatti hui
 In the past, academics divided the caves into three groups, but were rejected due to evidence and research
 us siddhanth ke anusaar 200 i purv se 200 i tak ek samooh, dwitiya samooh chhathi shatabdi kaa or tritiy samooh saatvin shatabdi kaa mana jaataa tha
 The expression cave temple used by the anglo-indians for the viharas was considered inappropriate
 ajanta ek prakaar kaa mahavidhyalay math tha
 Hiuen Tsang states that Dinnag, a famous Buddhist philosopher, philosopher who was the author of several texts on logic, lived here
 yah abhi anya saakshyon se pramanit hona shesh he
 At its peak, the Viharas had the ability to accommodate hundreds
 yahan shikshak or chaatr ek saath rahete the
 It is very sad that no cave of Vakataka stage is complete
 yah is kaaran hua ki shaasha vaakatak vansh ekaek shaktiviheen ho gaya, jisase uski praja bhi sankat main aa gayi
 Due to this, all activities were interrupted and stopped suddenly
 yah samay ajanta kaa antim kaal rahaa
 This is a first step and has no meaning in the sequence of other caves
 yah ashwanal aakaar kii dhaal par purvi ore se pratham gupha he
 According to Spink one of the last caves built at this site is towards the end of the Vakataka phase
 haalaanki koi shilalekhith sakshya upasthit nahin hai; phir bhi yah mana jaataa he ki vaakatak raja harisena is uttam sangrakshit gupha ke sangrakshak rahe hon
 The main reason for this is that Harisena was not initially involved in the protection of Ajanta, but could not stay away from them for a long time, because this site was full of activities during his reign and his Buddhist subjects were given this sacred work of that Hindu king
 Could be happy to shelter
 yahan darshit kai vishay rajsik hai
 This cave has very elaborate carving work, which also has many highly embossed crafts
 yahan buddha ke jivan se sambandhit kai ghatnaayen ankit hai, saath hi anek alankaran namoonay bhi hai
 Its two-storied gate-pavilion, which was visible until the nineteenth century, is now extinct
 is gupha ke aage ek khulaa sthaan tha, jiske donon ore khambhedaar galiyare the
 Its level was relatively high
 iske dwaar mandap ke donon ore kothiyaan hai
 The absence of the pillared cells at the end suggests that this pavilion was not built with the last phase of Ajanta, when the pillared cells had become a regular part

 There are three gateways here, one central and two sideways

 Each wall of the hall is about 40 feet long and 20 feet high

 a gargantuan image is carved on the back wall, in which the Buddha is shown seated in his dharma-chakra-vimana posture
 peeche, baayin evam daayin diwaar main chaar-chaar kamare bane hai
 These walls are full of paintings, which are in a perfect state of preservation
 darshit drishy adhiktar upadeshon, dharmik evam alankaran ke hai
 Their subjects are related to Jataka tales, life of Gautama Buddha, etc
 gupha sankhya 1 se lagi gupha san 2, deevaaron, chhaton evam stambhon par sangrakshit apni chitrakaari ke liye prasiddh he
 It looks very beautiful and looks almost similar to the cave number, but is in a far better state of conservation
 is gupha main do dwaar-mandap hai, jo ki sankhya 1 se bahut alag he
 Rather, the carving of the panels also looks different from that
 is gupha ko sahaara diye do achche khaase mote stambh hai, jo ki baari nakkashi se alankrita hai
 Yes, it definitely resembles the first cave in size, shape and land plan
 saamne kaa porch donon ore stambhon se yukt prakoshthon se yukt he
 Formerly, rooms made up of vacant spaces were necessary when the latter required space, as the latter increased the need for more accommodation

 Mural paintings on its roofs and walls have been published in sufficient quantity

 If seen, in politics, today, where each party has collected only the chandal-chowkadi of the spies, due to which the mud is seen in the place of clean water in the pond of politics; The lack of lotus like Shankardayal Singh is really disturbed in the polluted environment there

 Shankar Dayal Singh, who considers life as a sport of sunlight, was right to believe that just as nature balances itself, every person working in politics should be the first qualification criteria to be a writer

 In order to kill Hume during the freedom struggle, the fighters were completely surrounded by Hume, wearing a sari and hiding his identity

 These important things about Hume have been mentioned in the historical books of Etawah, in the thousand years of Etawah and in the history of Etawah

 Hume is considered to be an English officer who not only thought about his future too much but also worked on it
 vaise to itawa kaa vajood hum ke yahan aane se pehle hi ho gaya tha lekin hum ne jo kuch diya uske koi duusari misaal dekhne ko kahin bhi nahin milti
 Despite being an English officer, this Etawah love of Hume became a cause of trouble for him
 inhone bharat main bhinn-bhinn padon par kaam kiya or 1882 main avkaash grahan kiya
 At the same time, due to the unsatisfactory actions of the British Government, amazing awareness arose in India and they began to organize themselves
 is kaary main hum sahab se bharatiyon badi prerana mili
 In the last part of 1884, the Indian National Union was formed with the efforts of Surendranath Banerjee and Vyomesh Chandra Banerjee and Hume Sahab

 During his sabbatical, he tried to get more and more Indians to the British government
 is sambandh main unako kai baar england bhi janaa padaa
 In England, Hume sahab told the British that Indians are now able to manage their own country
 unako angrejon kii bhanti sab prakaar ke adhikaar praapt hone chahie or sarkari naukariyon main bhi samanta hona aavashyak he
 They will not sit peacefully until this happens

 The people of India started getting the biggest government posts

 Every suggestion of Hume sahib and Vyomeshchandra Banerjee was considered by the English government and consulted them in every government work
 hum apane ko bhartiya hi samajhate the
 He loved Indian food more
 gita tathaa bible ko pratidin padhaa karte the
 His speeches contained Indian ideas and how the Indian public can be made happy and how the British government should treat the Indian public, he used to say all these things in his articles and speeches
 ve kehete the ki bharat main ekta tathaa sanghatan kii badi aavashyaktaa he
 Whenever Indians will adopt both these qualities, at that time the British will leave India

 jab film camera yaa video camera se ek shot yaa photograph lene ke liye camera ko kisi vishisht sthaan par rakhaa jaataa he use camera angel kehete hai
 One shot can be taken from multiple angles at a time, simultaneously
 is se alag anubhavon yaa kabhi-kabhi alag bhavanaaen dikhaai ja sakati hai
 Each camera angle can produce a different effect on the audience
 iske alaava bhi kuch or raste hote hai jinase camera sanchaalak aise prabhaav paidaa kar saktaa he
 Keeping the subject Vastu in mind, where the camera is placed also affects the viewer's view of the subject
 camera angel kai prakaar ke hote hai, jaise: hai-angel shot, lo-angel shot, bards -oy vyuu or varm-oy vyuu
 a clear distance and angle through which the camera is visible or recorded is called a viewpoint
 oy-level shot or point of vyuu shot bhi kuch camera angles ke prakaar hai
 a high-angle shot is one in which the camera is placed above the subject Vastu and is looking down at it
 hai-angel shot vishay vaastu ko chota, kamazor or bhedya dikhataa he or vahin lo-angel shot vishay vaastu ko neeche se upar kii or dikhataa he, jaha camera vishay vaastu ke neeche rakhaa hota he jisase vishay vaastu shaktishaalee yaa dhamkaanewaala dikhaai detaa he
 Neutral shot or eye-level shot does not have any mental effect on the audience, in this shot the camera is kept in line with the subject Vastu exactly
 jab darshako ko vishay vaastu kii aankhon nazaaraa dikhaaya jaataa he tab use point of vyuu shot kehete hai
 Sometimes the camera is held in the hands to take a point of view shot so as to create an illusion for the viewer that the scene is being seen through the eyes of the subject
 bards oy shot yaa bards oy vyuu, shots drashya ke upar se liye jate he taaki paridrishy ko sthapit kiya ja sake
 When viewers are made to feel that they are watching the character from below, it is called a worm eye view, often used to show a view of a small child or a pet
 in camera angel ko chunate vaqt yah dhyaan main rakhana chahie kii har angel kaa ek alag prabhaav hota he isliye inkaa upyog seen athwa film ke sandharbh ko dhyaan main rakh kar karnaa chahie
 There are different types of shots that can be used using these angles
 jaise kii extream long shot jo kii vishay vaastu ke bahut dur se record kiya jaataa he or kabhi kabhi to isamen vishay dikhaai bhi nahin detaa he
 Extreme long shot is mostly taken from high angle, so that the viewer can see the plain position of the low scene
 extream long shot zyaadaatar kisi bhi seen ke shruwaat main upyog kiya jaataa he khaas kar use sthapit karne ke liye yaa phir varnanaatmak rup se seen kii vyvhastha darshakon ko dikhne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Although most shots are eye-level or point-of-view shots at the amator, it is possible to take any shot from any angle
 long-shot main vishay vaastu ko dikhaaya jaataa he kintu shot kii setting aisi hoti he kii pikchar frem vishay vaastu par haaavee hota he
 In medium-shot both the subject matter and settings have equal importance and both are 50 / 50 in the frame
 isse alag jab medium-shot main keval paatr par dhyaan yaa jor de rahaa hota he tab paatr ko qamar se upar tak dikhaa ke jaataa he, tab vah mid-shot hota he
 a medium close-up shot is one in which the character is shown above the chest
 close-up main kisi khaas visheshta yaa vishay ke hisse se puraa frem bhar jaataa he, jaise kii agar ek frem main keval paatr kaa cheharaa hi dikhaaya gaya ho
 And finally the extreme close-up shot, in which only one of the body parts of the character has completed the entire frame, such as eyes, hands, or some other part
 ye sabhi shot kinhi bhi purvakthith camera angles ke saath upyog kiye ja sakate hai
 The Dutch angle, also known as the contended angle or tilted angle, is the angle in which the camera itself is tilted to the right or left
 yah aprakratik angel darshakon ko aisa mahasoos karata he kii jaise duniya santulan ke bahaar chali gayi he yaa maansik ashaanti kii stithi paidaa karata he
 Every camera angle needs to be given a unique alphanumeric identity during production and post-production
 uddhran ke taur par "seen 24C
" camera angles ke naamo main die gaye aksharon ko aksar NATO phonetic alphabet yaa older police-style radio alphabet ke tarah bolaa jaataa he, jaise uddhran ke taur par "seen 24 charlie
" kuch aksharon ko upyog nahin kiya jaataa he kyun kii ve akshar likhane ke baat anko kii tarah dikhaai dete hai, jaise uddhran ke taur par "S" jo kii angreji main ank "5" kii tarah dikhta he
 Vrittra was an Asura in ancient Vedic religion who was also a serpent or azhadaha
 sanskrit main vrutra kaa arth 'dhakne vaala' hota he
 It also had another name 'ahi' which means 'snake' and which is found in the forms of 'azi' and 'azhi' in the Avastai language
 vedon main vrutra ek aisa andaha he jo nadiyon kaa maarg rokkar sookhaa paidaa kar detaa he or jiskaa vadh indra karte hai
 Some descriptions depict its three heads
 ek din shriramachandraji ne bharat or lakshmana ko apane paas bulaakar kaha, "he bhaaiyon! meri ichha rajasuya yajna karne kii he kyonki vah rajdharm kii charamasima he
 All sins are destroyed by this yagna and you get the results of renewable and imperishable fruit
 atah tum donon vichaarkar kaho ki is lok or paralok ke kalyaan ke liye kya yah yajna uttam rahegaa?" Hearing these words of the elder brother, the righteous Bharata said, "maharaj! The best religion on this earth, fame and this earth itself is reputed among you
 aap hi is sampoorn prithvi or is par rahane vaale samast raja bhi aapako pitrutulya maanate hai
 So, how can you do this Yajna so that all the dynasties and heroes of this earth are feared to be killed by us? " bharat ke yuktiyukt vachan sunakar shriram bahut prasann huye or bole, "bharat! tumhaara satyaparamarsh dharmsangat or prithvi kii raksha karne vaala he
 By accepting this good statement of yours, i give up my desire to perform Rajsuya Yagya
 " After that Laxman said, "O Raghunandan! There is also Ashwamegha Yagya to destroy all sins
" yadi aap yajna karnaa hi chaahate hai to is yajna ko kijiye
 This ancient account about Mahatma Indra is heard that when Indra was incurred by Brahma, he was sanctified by performing the Ashwamedha Yagya
 " On asking the full story by Sri Rama, Lakshmana said, "in ancient times, the demon named Vritrasura ruled the earth with full religious devotion
 ek baar vah apane jyeshtha putr madhureshwar ko rajya bhaar saunpkar kathor tapasya karne van main chalaa gaya
 Indra was also shaken by his penance
 vah bhagwaan vishnu ke paas jaakar bole ki prabho! tapasya ke bal se vritrasur ne itani adhik shakti sanchit kar lee he ki main ab us par shashan nahin kar saktaa
 If he increased his power more as a result of penance, then all of us gods would always be subject to him
 isaliye prabho! aap krupa karke sampoorn lokon ko uske aadhipaty se bachaaiye
 Slay him anyway
 "devraj indra kii yah prarthana sunakar bhagwaan vishnu bole ki yah to tum jaanate ho devraj! majhe vritrasur se sneh he
 That is why i cannot kill him, but i cannot refuse your prayers
 isaliye main apane tej ko teen bhaagon main is prakaar vibhajit kar doongaa jisase tum swayan vritrasur kaa vadh kar sako
 One part of my glory will enter you, another in your thunderbolt and third in the earth so that it can bear the weight of Vritrasura when it collapses
 bhagwaan se yah vardaan paakar indra devataaon sahit us van main gayi jahaan vrutra tapasya kar rahaa tha
 On getting the opportunity, Indra gave his powerful thunderbolt to the forehead of Vritrasura
 isse vrutra kaa sir katkar alag ja padaa
 As soon as the head was cut off, Indra started thinking, i have committed a huge sin by killing a innocent person
 yah sochakar ve kisi andhkaarmay sthaan main jaakar praayshchit karne lage
 When Indra was lost, the Gods prayed to Lord Vishnu, o Deenabandhu! If you hit Vritrasura, it has gone faster than you, but Indra has to suffer the sin of brahmacharya
 isaliye aap unke uddhaar kaa koi upaay bataaiye
 Hearing this, Vishnu said that if Indra worshiped Yajnapurusha by performing the Ashwamedha Yagna, he would get the post of Devendra without sin
 indra ne aisa hi kiya or ashwamegh yajna ke pratap se unhone brahmahatya se mukti praapt kii
 " ek katha vritrasur kii he jisko murkh logo ne aisa dhar ke lautaa he ki vah pramaan or yukti in donon se viruddh ja padi he
 'vritrasura, the son of Tvashta, swallowed Indra, the king of the gods
 tab sab devtaa log bade bhay yukt hokar vishnu ke sameep gayi, or vishnu ne uske maarane kaa upaay batalaaya ki --main samudr ke phen main pravisht ho jaaounga
 You guys, pick up that froth and kill Vritrasura, he will die
 ' The story of mythology made like crazy is all false
 shreshth logo ko uchit he ki inako kabhi na maane
 Look, this story is written in the Satyagraha in such a way that - yahan surya kaa indra naam he
 We call his valor done, which is very strong for being the ultimate glory
 vah apni kirnon se 'vrutra' arthath megh ko martha he
 When he dies and falls in the earth, then he spreads his water body in all the earth
 phir usase anek badi-2 nadi paripurna hoke samudr main ja milti hai
 What are those rivers that water originating from mountains and clouds is meant to flow
 jis samay indra meghroop vritrasur ko maar ke akaash se prithvi main gira detaa he, tab vah prithvi main so jaataa he
 
 1
 
 phir vahi megh akaash main se neeche girake parvat arthath meghmandal kaa punah aashray letaa he
 Whom the Sun breaches again with its rays
 jaise koi lakdi ko chhil ke sookshm kar detaa he
 In the same way, he also plunges the cloud into the earth, and his body forms the water through the rivers in such a way that the cows get from their calves in the race
 
 2
 
 When Surya disintegrates that very fallen cloud in the earth such that a person cuts the body of a person and cuts it down, then that Vritrasura also becomes like a sleeping person on the earth
 
 3
 
 In 'nighantu', the name of the cloud is Vritra - the enemy of Vrittra means preventive Surya, Surya's name is Tvashtha, his child is the cloud, because the rays of the Sun become cloudy by moving upwards to form water particles
 tathaa megh kaa vrutra naam isaliye he ki vrutrovrinoteh0 vah sweekaar karne yogya or prakaash kaa aavaran karne vaala he
 Large rivers originate from this watery body of the circle and go into the deep sea, and the water remains in the pond and well, as if it is sleeping in the earth
 
 5
 
 That circle can never win Indra even with its lightning and thundering fear
 is prakaar alankariroop varnan se indra or vrutra ye donon paraspar yuddh ke saamaan karte hai, arthath jab megh badhata he, tab to vah sury ke prakaash ko hataata he, or jab sury kaa taap arthath tej badhata he tab vah vrutra naam megh ko hataa detaa he
 But at the end of this war, the name of Indra is conquered by Surya
 jab jab megh vruddhi ko praapt hokar prithvi or akaash main vistrut hoke failata he, tab tab usko sury hanan karke prithvi main gira detaa he
 After that, having impure land, rotten vegetation, wood, straw and excrement, it sometimes causes deodorant
 tab samudr kaa jal dekhne main bhayankar maaloom padane lagata he
 In this way, there is a frequent cloudy year
 --arthath sab sthanon se jal ud ud kar akaash main badhata he
 Gathers there and rains again
 usee jal or prithvi ke sayong se oshadhi aadi anek padaarth utpann hote hai
 The same cloud is called 'vritrasura'
 vaayu or sury kaa naam indra he
 Air is located in the sky and in the sunlight
 inhen vritrasur or indra kaa akaash main yuddh hua karata he ki jiske ant main megh kaa paraajay or sury kaa vijay nihsandeh hota he
 Except for the ornate form of these true texts, people with little intellect like fools have written false stories in the brahma-vaivarta and Srimad Bhagavatadi texts, never consider them superior men

 rajiadhipati ko rajya ke adhikariyon or janata kii gatividhiyon evam sameepvarti shaskaon kii nitiyon ke sambandh main suchnaayen dene kaa mahatvapurn kaary unke guptcharon dwaara sampann hota tha
 Durmukh mentioned in the Ramayana was one such detective who gave Ramachandra the information about Sita's genocide
 arthshaastra main ullekh he ki raja ke paas vishwaasapaatr guptcharon kaa samudaay hona chahie or in guptcharon ko yogya evam vishwast mantriyon ke nirdesan main kaam karnaa chahie
 In economics, there are two types of detectives named 'samasht' and 'sanchar'
 samsht koti ke guptchar sthaneey suchnaayen dete the or sanchaar koti ke guptchar vibhinn sthanon kaa paribhraman karke soosachanaayen ekatra karte the
 There were many types of detectives of the entire category, such as the scorching, the heated, the homemaker, the vaudeka and the tapas
 sanchaar naamak guptchar main satritikshn, rashad evam stri guptchar jaise bhikshuki, parivrajika, mund, vishalee bhi hoti thim
 In the era of Chandragupta Maurya, secret correspondents and visiting judges were used to control remotely located officials
 ye samvaadadaata athwa nirnaayak un adhikariyon ke kaaryakalapon kaa bhaleebhanti nirikshan evam moolyankan karte the or raja ko is sambandh main gupt rup se suchnaayen bhejte the
 The class of such spies continued to function smoothly till the time of Ashoka
 uske baad bhi shashan main guptcharon kaa mahatv bana rahaa
 The rank of these detectives was given only to the most loyal people of the state
 guptcharon kaa upyog sangathit rup se or vistrut paimaane par muslim or mughalkaal main nahin hua
 The Muslim and Mughal police rule, laid by Sher Shah, was based on the principles of responsibility of the local head, head or local police officers
 kintu thodi si sankhya main shashan ke adhikariyon evam prajajanon kii manovritiyon tathaa kaaryakalapon kii soochna dene ke liye raja dwaara apane vishwaasapaatr or chatur anucharon kaa prayog maatr hota rahaa
 At present, the use of detectives within and outside the country for political purposes is a universally accepted political notion
 germany ke gestapo dal ne natsi shashan ko desh ke bheetar sudrudh banane main atyant mahatvapurn yoga diya
 The success of Hitler and his principal assistant Himmler, the policy of suppressing the anti-natsi anti-regime elements, is attributed to the Gestapo party whose feelings of terror and fear were sustained in every person's heart by detectives
 germany main is guptchar dal kaa sanghathan itnaa vyapak tha ki nagarikon kii shashan virdohi prayek gatividhi kii soochna sarkaar ko turant mil jaati thi or vah vyakti abhiyukt banakar dand kaa bhaagi hota tha
 During the period of the establishment of Tsarist and then Communist rule, intelligence parties in Russia acted to give information about the anti-government activities, as a result of which the public was always afraid of the anti-government statement and work
 pichley do vishwayudhon main, visheshkar dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay, antarrashtriya guptchar dalon kaa yuddh main sanlagn deshon dwaara sanghathan kiya gaya
 Agents were either made or sent by one country to another to receive military institutions, ordinances, factories, military plans and expeditions

 These agents used to transmit or disseminate information to the enemy's officers or specific persons by establishing intimacy with them or by obtaining necessary information from any other secret device
 aise anek guptchar yudhkaal main pakade gaye or unhen kathor dand diya gaya
 The organization of political detectives is widely practiced at the present time
 vidrohi athwa rajya virdohi tatwon se prayek sarkaar aakraant he
 Where there is governance, the supporters of democracy try to reverse the state power
 prajatantravaadi deshon main jo samyavaadee nahin hai, samyavaadee vicharonvaale, araajaktaavaadi athwa anya aprajatantric tatv satta hathiyaane kii cheshtaa karte hai or apni kaarywahiyon se bahari deshon kaa samarthan athwa sambandh banaae rakhte hai
 From the point of view of state interest, information about their activities is given by detectives
 sansar ke deshon main jo do virdohi varg is samay sthapit hai unamem ek duusare ke raajnneetik athwa sainik rahasyon kii jaankaree ke nimitt yuktiyon kaa prayog hota he
 Scientific methods are now being used for the collection of secret information
 san 1960 kii you-2 vimaan ghatana vaigyanik upkarnon ke upyog kaa pramukh udhaaharan he jab nabhmandal main prithvi se paryaapt oonchaai par vaigyanik sadhano evam photography kii vishisht saamagree se yukt ladanevaale amareeki vimaanchaalak ko rus ne topon dwaara gira liya tha or is prakaar roosi sainik sansthaanon kii photo lene kii amareeki yukti kaa anaavaran kiya tha
 In addition to political spies, each country has another type of intelligence known as intelligence police as part of the governance system
 inkaa kaam aparaadh or aparaadhiyon kii chaanbin apratyaksh rup se karnaa he
 They search for the culprit using the sources of crime found at the scene

 Dayanand Kanya Inter College is a government school located in Subhash Nagar, Dehradun, Uttarakhand
 isaki sthapana shri panna laal dwaara 1972 main kii gai thi
 The general information about the school is as follows: - gasatran yaa 'gas prachhadak' us aavaran ko kehete hai jise chehre par dhaaran karne se vaayu main mishrit vifailli gaison evam anya pradooshkon se raksha hoti he
 The gas covers the nose and mouth and does not allow external air to enter the nose / mouth
 isamen aankh va chehre ke anya komal utakon ko dhakne kii vyavastha bhi ho sakati he
 In the First World War, the first war war gases were used to conquer the enemies and to avoid the impact of the war gas, the first gas war was used
 us samay kaa gasatran bada bhadda hota tha
 This troon was kept on the face
 usamen ek nalee hoti thi jo ek canster se jodi rahati thi
 It used to hang in front of Canister's neck
 canster main lakdi kaa koyala rakhaa rahata tha, jisamen paarit hokar shuddh vaayu naak main jaati thi
 The toxic gas was absorbed into the coal
 is gasatran se sainikon ko ladane main bahut asuvidhaayen hoti thim
 In World War II, gaseration became very advanced
 yah paryaapt halkaa tha or canster sharir ke parshv main lataka rahata tha, jisase yuddh karne main aadchan kam hoti thi
 It improved even further
 ab aise traan bane jinaki taul teen pound se bhi kam thi
 Kannster is now directly connected to Tran
 isse bhaddi lambii nalee kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahi
 The sieved pure air comes from above and enters the nasal cavities without blurring the eye glasses
 canster main bharne ke liye ab koyale ke saath soda chuunaa bhi prayukt hota he
 If there are microscopic solid particles scattered in the air of the battlefield, mattresses of felt are kept in the airways of the troposphere to remove them, in which solid particles are sieved
 gasatran kaa upyog ab keval yuddh main hi nahin hota, varan khan or rasinic sanyantron main, jahaan hanikaarak gaisen or dhuen banate hai, inkaa upyog kaam karanevaalon or aag bujhaanewaale vyaktiyon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he

 The bodies of organisms are made up of very small cells
 saralatam ek-koshikai jeev ko len
 We know the chemical structure of the cell
 koshikaia protein se bani hai or unke andar nabhik main nabhikeey amla he
 These proteins are formed by chain sorting of only 20 types of amino acids, and thus a variety of proteins are composed of 20 amino acids
 america or roosi vaigyanikaan ne prayog se siddh kiya ki methane, ammonia or oxigen ko kaanch ke khokhale lattu ke andar band kar vidyut chinagaari dwaara amino amla kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 He began to say that on a lifeless earth in ancient times, in an atmosphere filled with methane, ammonia and oxygen, electric thunder between the clouds made amino acids, which added proteins
 apane pracheen granthon main surya ko jivan kaa daata kaha gaya he
 Inspired by this, experiments were done in India that when sunlight falls on water in the presence of formaldehyde, amino acids are produced
 isamen formaldihide utprerak kaa kaary karti he
 It does not require electrical launch in any particular type of atmosphere
 ab koshika kaa nabhikeey amla ? imali ke beej se imali kaa hi ped utpann hoga, pashu kaa baccha vaisaa hi pashu banegaa, yah nabhikeey amla kii maaya he
 This nuclear acid forms the nucleus of the gene, from which the composition of the body and brain and the properties that are obtained in inheritance - all are passed on from the old generation to the new generation
 jab prajnan ke kram main ek koshika do koshika main vibhakt hoti he to dono koshikayen janak koshika kii bhanti hongi, yah nabhikeey amla ke kaaran he
 With five types of nuclear acid, you can make as many types of nuclear acids as you want from a molecule structure like a ladder
 nabhikeey amla main antarnihit gun he ki vah uchit paristhiti main apane ko vibhakt kar do samaan gundharmi swatantra astitv dharna karata he
 Secondly, which type of protein is made, it also determines nuclear acid
 ek se usee prakaar ke anek jeev banane ke jaadu kaa rahasy isi main he
 Did the gods of a distant planet, enlightened beings, sow these five nuclear acid's original compounds on this earth? ek koshika main lagbhag nau arab parmaanu hote hai
 How is it possible that so many atoms come together to form a living cell? vibhinn avasthaaon main bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke protein yaa nabhikeey amla banane ke pashchaat bhi yah prashn shesh rahata he ki inhone kis paristhiti main sanyukt hokar jivan sambhav kiya
 In India, Dr
 Krishna Bahadur created bacteria through a photo-chemical process
 formaldihide kii utprerak upasthiti main surya kii kirnon se protein tathaa nabhikeey amla ek koshikeey jeevanu me sanyojit hue
 These bacteria grow for themselves by ingesting nutritious food, digesting it and forming part of the cell
 jeev vigyaan main is prakaar swavardhan kii kriya ko ham upaapachay kehete hai
 These bacteria grow from the inside, like the beautiful Kantya rava hanging inside the slurry in the chemistry, not from outside
 jeevanu badhkar ek se do bhi ho jate hai, arthath prajnan bhi hota he
 And such bacteria were made not only of carbon but also of copper, silicon etc
, which had the above mentioned qualities of life
 kehete hai ki jeev ke andar ek chetana hoti he
 What is that consciousness? If the needle pierces the finger, the finger immediately pulls back, bowing in front of the external stimulus
 maan lo ki ek santulit tantra he
 If there was an external obstacle in him, a desire, a desire arose that the obstacle should be removed
 niraakaran karne ke liye kisi seemaa tak us santulit tantra main parivartan bhi hota he
 If this is Chaitanya then it is in humans and animals
 kuch kahenge, vanaspatiyon, ped-paudhon main bhi he
 But think of an atom — there are electric particles revolving around the nucleus
 paas ke kisi shakti-kshetra kii chaaya ke rup main koi bahya baadha aane par yah anu apane andar kuch parivartan laata he or aanshik rup main hi kyon na ho, kabhi-kabhi use niraakrit kar letaa he
 Willingness and ability to eradicate external pressure to some extent - this is Chaitanya
 yah chaitanya sarvyaapee he
 In the words of Maharshi Aravind, 'the living entity and root of the pasture, is the omnipresent Chaitanya contained in all
 ‘ But life is different from inertia, today this difference is evident
 sabhi jeev upaapachay dwaara arthath baahar se yogya aahaar lekar pachaate hue sharir kaa bhaag banaakar, swavardhan karte tathaa urja praapt karte hai
 The root objects do not see the process of growing from the inside
 phir mote taur par sabhi jeev apni tarah ke anya jeev paidaa karte hai
 Even a single-celled microscopic organism; As the amoeba grows, it gets divided into two or many of its own unicellular organisms
 kabhi-kabhi anek avasthaaon se guzarakar jeev praudhata ko praapt hote hai or tabhi prajnan se pun: kram chalata he
 Reproduction in some form or the other is the instinct of life, as if the creature is for this
 par ye donon gun jeevanu main bhi hai
 If this is an evolutionary definition of life, then bacteria is its primary link
 koshika main ye vrittiyaan kyon utpann hui ? iskaa uttar darshan, bhautikee tathaa rasayan ke us sandhi-sthal par he jahaan jeev vigyaan prarambh hota he
 Here all the sciences get blurred into each other, as if all are united
 iske liye do buniyadi bhartiya abhidharanaayen hai— yah padaarth maatr kaa gun he ki uski tikaoo ikai main apni punrariti karneki pravriti he
 The Purusha Sukta has called repetition the law of creation
 har jivit tantra main ek anukulanshiltaa he; jo baadhaein aati hai unka aanshik rup main niraakaran, apane ko paristhiti ke anukool banaakar, vah kar saktaa he
 a far-reaching result of these qualities is the evolutionary journey of the organism
 chaitanya sarvyaapee he or jeev tathaa jad sabamein vidyaman he, yah vishuddh bhartiya darshan samyavaadiyon ko akharata tha
 Both the above Indian conceptions, which show the behavior of bacteria and the reason for the growth journey of the organism, shook them
 yah vishwaas anek sabhyataaon main rahaa he ki ishwar ne sristi kii rachana kii
 There are many imaginations of God in Indian philosophy
 aisa samajhnaa ki ve sari kalpanaagan srishtikarta ishwar kii hai, thik na hoga
 With the faith of God, what can be called an atheistic philosophy flourished here
 kanad rishi ne kaha ki yah sari sristi parmaanu se bani he
 Sankhya philosophy can also be called an atheistic philosophy from a point of view
 sankhya kii manyata he ki purush evam prakruti do alag tatv hai or donon ke sanyog se sristi utpann hui
 Man is passive and nature is fickle; She is illusionary and keeps changing
 par bina purush ke yah sansar, yah charachar sristi nahin ho sakati
 Upma was given that if the man is Sun then Prakriti Moon, that is, he is brighter than his
 mere ek mitra is antar ko bataane ke liye ek roopak sunaate the
 He said that there was no electricity in his childhood and gas lamps, which could gather in the light, were mandatory
 par gas lamp niskriy tha
 He did not clap, nor wow, nor participate in the proceedings, nor could he inspire nor consult
 par yadi sabha main maar-peet bhi kerani ho to gas lamp kii aavashyaktaa thi, kahin apane samarthak hi andhere main na pit jaafan
 This gas lamp or light is the 'man' of Sankhya darshan
 vah niskriy he, kuch karata nahin
 But there could not be a meeting without him
 isi prakaar prasiddh nau upanishdon main paanch upanishdon ko, jis arth main bible ne srishtikarta ishwar kii mahima kahi, us arth main anishvaravaadi kah sakate hai
 Among the texts that consider God as the creator, there is a famous sentence, 'ekohun Bahusamy'
 ishwar ke man main ichha utpann hui ki main ek hoon, anek banun or isliye apni hi anek anukritiyaan banaai—aisa arth usamen lagaate hai
 But to become one to many is the quality of an organism
 yahi nahin, yah to padaarth maatr kii bhi swaabhaavik pravriti he
 According to Indian philosophy, this creation is not a creation of anyone, as is the Christian or Muslim belief
 yadi ishwar ne yah bramhand rachaa to ishwar tha hi, arthath kuch sristi thi
 Therefore, God himself was a physical element or substance, it has to be said
 isi se kaha ki yah akhil bramhand keval uski abhivyakti athwa prakatikaran he, rachana athwa nirmit nahin
 In the same way as gold ornament, the size of gold is only special
 isi rup main bhartiya darshan ne sristi ko dekha
 People of religious instincts have the idea that life was born on this earth by natural and compulsory chemical-physical process without any miraculous power, so it is counterproductive that they relate the soul to the soul
 unka vishwaas he ki bina aatma ke jivan sambhav nahin or isliye koi paramatma he jisamen antatogatva sab atmathan villin ho jaati hai
 But the natural beauty of the root nature, the crystal, the sun that holds the gold on the snowy peaks of the Himalayas, the redness of the sun or the sunset of the treaty of the three oceans of Kanyakumari, or the lights playing on the rippling waters of the lake
 - Are all these insects or mosquitoes or cancerous molds or amarabels or any petty animals? Is there a soul in the plants and mushrooms that grow in them? One thing Muslims or Christians do not believe
 sristi main is prakaar ke jivit tathaa jad vastuon main bhedbhaav bhala kyon ? Perhaps we think, all living beings have an end
 ‘kehi jag kaal na khaay
 'flora and fauna all die and their body is destroyed
 parantu yadi ek-koshik jeev bada hokar apane hi prakaar ke do yaa adhik jeevon main bant jaataa he to is ghatana ko pehle jeev kii mrityu kahenge kya ? vaise to santati bhi mata-pita ke jivan kaa vistaar hi he, unka jivanansh ek nae sharir main pravesh karata he
 Origin of the creature hajipur lok sabha nirvachan kshetra bharat ke bihar rajya kaa ek lok sabha nirvachan kshetra he
