 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai
 Five major deities are revered in Hinduism beliefs
 ye ek ishwar ke hi alag-alag rup or shaktiyaan hai
 Jupiter is considered the guru of the gods
 puranic manyataon ke anusaar ve maharishi angira ke putr the
 He attained the position of Devguru through the hard tenacity of Lord Shiva
 unhone apane gyaan bal va mantra shaktiyon se devataaon kii raksha kii
 He is also revered as a Guru planet by the grace of Shiva
 guuruuvaar, guru brihaspatidev kii upasna kaa vishesh din he
 Shukracharya, the guru of the demons, is considered
 brahmadev ke putr maharishi bhrigu inke pita the
 It was Shukracharya who received the dead Sanjivani Vidya by performing harsh penance of Shiva, by which he used to burn his life again in the dead body
 brahmadev kii krupa se yah shukr grah ke rup main poojaneey hai
 Friday is the special day of worship of Venus
 hindu dharm ke anusaar har chetan praani main ek abhautik aatma hoti he, jo sanathan, avyakt, aprameya or vikaar rahit he
 According to Hinduism, not only human beings, but every animal and plant, that is, every living being has a soul
 bhagavadgita main bhagwaan shrikrishna dwaara aatma ke lakshan is prakaar bataae gaye hai: In any birth, according to the deeds done freely, the soul assumes the next body
 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina
 janm maran kaa sansaarik chakra tabhi khatm hota he jab vyakti ko moksh miltaa he
 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever
 maanav yoni hi akelaa aisa janm he jisamen manushya ke karm, paap or punyamay fal dete hai or sukarm ke dwaara moksh kii prapti mumkin he
 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai 
 The major Smriti texts are: History - Ramayana and Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, Purana -, Manusmriti, Dharmashastra and Dharmasutra, Agam Shastra
 bhartiya darshan ke 6 pramukh ang hai- sankhya darshan, yoga, nyaay, vaisheshik, mimasaa or veydant
 According to Hindu scriptures, the demons of the deity religion are the symbol of unrighteousness
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki puranic manyataon main dev-daanvon ko ek hi pita, kintu alag-alag maataaon kii santan bataaya gaya he
 According to this, the father of the Devas and Demons is Rishi Kashyapa

 India is a vast country, but we cannot know its greatness and greatness until we see it
 is ore vaise anek mahapurushon kaa dhyaan gaya, lekin aaj se baarah sau varsh pehle aadiguru shankaracharya ne iske liye ek bahut hi mahatvapurn kaary kiya
 He established four benches at the ends of India in four directions, Jyotipitha near Badrinath in the north, Sringeri Peeth near Rameshwaram in the south, Govardhan Peeth in Jagannathpuri in the east and Dwarikapith in the west
 tirthon ke prati hamaare deshavaasiyon main badi bhakthi bhaavana he
 Therefore, by establishing these chairs Shankaracharya gave the countrymen a comfortable opportunity to visit the whole of India
 ye chaaron tirth chaar dham kehalaate he
 People believe that the person who travels to these four dhams gets blessed
 zyaadaatar hindu bhagwaan kii murtiyon dwaara puja karte hai
 For them, the idol is a simple instrument, in which the same formless God can be seen in any beautiful form as he wishes
 hindu log vastav main pathar or lohe kii puja nahin karte, jaisaa ki kuch log samajhate hai
 Idols are merely a means for Hindus to do devotion to God

 There were no temples during the ancient Vedic period
 tab upasna agni ke sthaan par hoti thi jisamen ek sone kii murti ishwar ke pratik ke rup main sthapit kii jaati thi
 According to one view, due to the worship of Buddha and Mahavira idols and temples by Buddhist and Jain religions, Hindus too started building temples after being influenced by them
 har mandir main ek yaa adhik devataaon kii upasna hoti he
 The idol of the presiding deity is revered in the sanctum sanctorum
 mandir pracheen or madhyayugin bhartiya kala ke shreshthatam pratik hai
 Millions of pilgrims visit the temples every year
 adhikansh hindu chaar shankaraachaaryon ko hindu dharm ke sarvocch dharmaguru maanate hai

 The standard charger adopted by the 17 manufacturers, including Nokia, Samsung and Motorola, should be the micro USB connector

 Mobile phone manufacturers, including solar cells, are experimenting on alternative sources of energy
 bydaree ke alaava, GSM mobile phone ko kaam karne ke liye ek choti si microchip kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise graahak pahchaan maapdand yaa sim card kaha jaataa he
 The SIM card of approximately a postage stamp size is usually placed at the back of the unit under the battery and stores the configuration data and information about the phone, such as which call scheme the user is using
 jab graahak sim card ko hataa detaa he, to ise pun: duusare phone main daal kar saamaanya rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each SIM card is activated by the use of a unique numeric identifier; Once activated, the identifier is localized and the card is permanently clad in the active network
 is kaaran se, adhikansh khudara vikreta ek sakriy kiye gaye sim card ko vaapis lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 Cell phones that do not use a SIM card have data programmed into their memory
 ek vishesh aankik kram kaa upyog karke is data kaa upyog kiya jaataa he he, "NAM" ko "naam" yaa number kramadesh suchi ke rup main upyog karne ke liye
 From here, one can get any information such as a number for your phone, new service provider number, new emergency number, change of their authentication key or A-key code and list or perl to rotate their favorites
 However, to prevent someone from accidentally deactivating their phone or deleting it from the network, service providers use a master assistant shut down or MSL on this data
 MSL yah sunishchit karata he ki seva pradaata khride gaye yaa patte par liye gaye phone ke liye bhugtan praapt karen
 For example, the Motorola RAZR V9C costs more than CAD $ 500
 lagbhag $200 main, vaahak ke aadhaar par, aapako ek mil sakati he
 The difference is paid by the customer as a monthly bill
 yadi graahak ne ek MSL kaa upyog nahin kiya, to ve $300 - $400 kaa antar kho denge jo unke masik bill main bhugtan kiya jaataa he, kyunki kuch graahak maujuuda seva ko radd karke duusare vaahak ke paas phone le jate hai
 The MSL applies to the SIM only because once the contract is completed, the MSL still applies to the SIM
 phone haalanki, shuru main bhi seva pradaata MSL main nirmaataa dwaara band kiya jaataa he
 This lock can be disabled so that this phone can use another service provider's SIM card
 america ke baahar kharide gaye phone khule phone hai kyonki vahaan zyaadaatar phone ek duusare ke nikatataa main kai seva pradaata yaa ativyapee vyapti he
 The cost of unlocking a phone varies but is usually very inexpensive and sometimes provided by independent phone vendors

 mrityu ke praayah dedh maah baad 18 farvari 1700 ko maharashtra ke shahi-shivi main bishan singh ke kabul main hue nidhan kii khabar pahaunchi, to do din baad badshaah aurangzeb ne unke sabase bade putr kaa naam vijay singh se badal kar jaisingh karte hue, unhen amer kii gaddi kaa vaaris sweekaar kiya
 The king named Jai Singh's younger brother Cheema ji as Vijay Singh
 yadunath sarkaar ke anusaar "


july 1698 main dakshin se lautne ke baad se jaisingh amer main hi bane rahe, jab ki badshaah ne inhen hajiri dene ke liye kai 'kade bulaave' bhi bheje| inke pita ke samay se hi dilli-badshaah inako apni sainik 'seva' main lene ke liye hetu dakshin main bulaanaa chaahate the
 But King Vishnusinh did not want to send his son to the south
 lekin badshaah ke zyada dabaav dene par i0 1698 main ye maharashtra gayi
 After returning to the Mughal camp for eight months, he returned to his capital, Amer
 gaddi par baithne ke turant baad, jaisaa upar likhaa gaya he, inhen navambar 1700 main dakshin main apni sena ke saath mogul badshaah kii fuj ke rup main ladane ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha, par kisi na kisi tarah jaisingh baraabar taalamatol karte rahe
 When he had disobeyed many royal orders, the king eventually sent some of them to Amer to bring them 'forcibly'
 Annoyed by his absence, Emperor Aurangzeb did not take away the title of Amer Raja from him, but on 13 September 1701, he was 'demoted', making him a modest mansabdar of only 500 castes, 100 riders
 kathin maarg or varsha se avaruddh raaston se jujhate burhanpur main padaav daal kar oktober 1701 main inke dakshin main pahunchne par inhen aurangzeb ke pote shah bidarbakht ke paas panhala kii suraksha ke liye unka sainya-sahyogi niyukt kiya gaya
 The Badshahi army led by Aurangzeb's grandson Shah Bidar Bakht attacked the fort of Khilna on 11 May 1702
 isamen amer or mogul sanyukt-sena kii bahut janahani hui, par uski deevaaron ko tod kar sabase pehle jaisingh kii kushwaha sena hi khilanaa-durg main pravisht hui
 Amber's 'panchranga flag' was hoisted on his turret
 
 In the blossom-war, his brave and trusted Diwan Buddha Singh was killed
 is khilanaa-vijay par badshaah aurangzeb dwaara inkaa mansab badha kar pehle ek hazaar, phir shah bidarbakht ke anurodh ke baad 2000 kaa kar diya gaya
 Jai Singh received this award for the six-year 'hard service' of the emperor! After this, when Shahzada Bidarbakht became the Subedar of Malve, he made him the Deputy Subedar there, respecting the services of Jaisingh, which Aurangzeb immediately 'disallowed' and wrote a decree that Ainda even a Hindu to a minor faujdar
 Neither should be made
 ' The irony is that Aurangzeb, who once honored him by calling him 'sawai', was later so annoyed and prejudiced that he issued this insulting command - "by not giving Jayasinha a seat on Masnad, laying on the ground below"
 Ask to sit on Sujani! " isi bich i0 1704 main do baadashahi faujadaaron ne sthaneey madad le kar thakur kushal singh rajaavat se savai madhopur main aaj sthit jhilaay thikaane kii jaagir chin kar 13 navambar 1704 ko jaisingh ko saunp di
 In the second year A
D
 1705, Shah Bidarbakht tried again in his favor and made Jaisingh also the deputy governor of Malwa
 par jab tak aurangzeb jivit rahaa, mogul kheme main inkaa prabhaav maddham sa hi rahaa
 After the death of Aurangzeb on 21 February in 1707, a fierce struggle between his sons for the Mughal throne began
 shah ajam ne agra va dilli par chadhaai kii
 By that time, he had reduced his mansab to 5000 and 500 riders
 june 18, 1707 i0 ko maujam or aazam kii senaaon ke bich agra ke 20 mile dakshin main jaju kaa yuddh hua
 Jaisingh was with Maujam and his immediate younger brother, Cheema, towards Azam's army
 is yuddh main maujam or unke putr maare gayi
 Azam won in the battle of Jaju
 isi yuddh main jaisingh tathaa akhesinh toradi bhi ghayal hue | inke kai sardaar- biharidas, kesharisingh, surasingh aadi maare gayi
 At the end of the war, the king of Jai Singh Bundi met his brother-in-law Budhsinh Hada in the battle of victory, but he did not give them a special welcome
 , Jaisingh's younger brother Vijay Singh wanted to get his sister married to Emperor Bahadur Shah to please the emperor
 unhone isaki khabar dilli bhej di tathaa buddhasingh hada ko chuttee jate samay raste main roak kar un se saamod main yah vivaah karvaa diya
 The new emperor Bahadur Shah attacked Rajasthan after this
 janvari 1708 i0 main vah amer pahunchaa or use khalsa kar liya
 The estate of Amir from Jaisingh was confiscated and given by King Bahadur Shah on 10 January 1708 to his younger brother Vijay Singh with many expensive gifts
 savai jaisingh kaa rajnatik kad gata kar ek maamuli 'manasabadaar' ke rup main kar diya gaya
 The king then proceeded to fight his brother Kambaksha for the south via Ajmer
 amer or jodhpur ke donon raja mandaleshwar ke ilaake tak uske saath hi gayi
 When he did not expect the emperor to return to his territory, he, in the opinion of Durgadas Rathore, left the Badshahi-camp on 20 April 1708 Vaishakh Sudi 13, when the emperor proceeded to cross the Narmada river and went back to Rajputana
 Mewar reached Udaipur
 yahan maharana pratap ke putr or uttaradhikareerana amarsingh ne inkaa swaagat kiya tathaa apni potee jaisingh ko byaahi
 From here, 30 thousand army of three kings jointly attacked Jodhpur and took possession of it on 8 July 1708
 raja atsingh jodhpur ke jaisingh ne tikaa kiya
 From here, he also wrote letters to several kings of Hindustan to collect against the Mughals
 joghpur se vijay singh shasit amer par adhikaar karne ko do senaayen bheji gayin
 Led by a Durgadas Rathore, who had a war with the Sayyids near Kala Dera
 duusari sena main, maharaja jaisingh kaa dewan ramachandra or shyamsingh ke adheen 20 hajaar ghudsavaar the
 He had a fight with Hausain Khan, the Faujdar of Amer near Ratanpura, in which he defeated him and took control of Amer
 iske baad in donon raajaaon ke viruddh var xxrep 6 
 xxrep 4 ? ne mevaat ke faujadaar saiyad husain khan, ahamed khan faujadaar bairth sidhaana or gaaraat khan faujadaar narnol ko sambar bheja
 These soldiers of these two kings fought a fierce battle in Sambhar on October 3, 1708, in which the Mughals won
 yuddh ke baad vijay kii khushi main mughalon kii mehfil ho rahi thi
 At the same time, under the leadership of Rao Sangram Singh, the Naruka fighters reached there and climbed on a sand dune, under which Syed etc
 was making a great deal
 narrukon ne un par ekaek banduukon or tiron se bhayanak hamalaa kiya
 All the Mughal soldiers were killed in it and the winning stake of the Mughals went out of hand
 phir jaisingh ne ek patr badshaah ke viruddh durgadas ko likhaa ki "udaipur maharana se baat kii jaae 


maraathon ko mila kar mughalon ke viruddh rajputon ko vahi karnaa chahie jo 'hindustan' ke liye gaurav kii baat ho
 " badshaah bahadurshah jab dakshin se vaapis lautaa, to usne yah jaruri samajha ki kisi tarah jodhpur or amer donon raajaaon se samjhauta kiya jaae
 To bring them, he sent Budhsingh Hada king Bundi, against whom on 21 June 1710, he appeared before the emperor near Ajmer
 badshaah ne inke jabt kiye rajya waapas lautaa die or in donon ko 4000 jaat 4000 savaar ke mansab bhi diye
 Even at that time, the Rajputs had no faith in the Mughals, so when Sawai Jaisingh went to the Emperor's camp in Ajmer, all the mountains and valleys of Ajmer were filled with Rajput soldiers
 mansab badhane or ilaake waapas aane par bhi unhen bahadurshah kii niyat par kabhi bhi purna vishwaas nahin hua
 Something happened to Jaisingh's brother Vijay Singh too that after being disappointed, he finally left the Mughal court and came to Hindaun
 jaisingh ko bhai vijaisingh kii taraf se sashastr vidroh khatra to bana hua tha hi
 In 1713 AD, in the name of compromising Vijay Singh and 'meeting the Rajmata', he along with his armed soldiers and chieftains went to Sanganer and imprisoned them fraudulently and sent them to Jaigad Fort
 vijaisingh ke is 'hatyakand' main shyamsingh khangarot vishesh sahaayak rahaa
 After the death of Bahadur Shah, his successor Jahandarshah sought to back both Amer and Marwar kings in his favor
 usne donon ko 7000 jaat va 7000 savaar kaa mansab bhi diya, parantu is baar inhone mogul-uttaradhikari ke aapasi sangharsh main aurangzeb ke putron se dur hi rahane kaa faisla kiya
 After Farrukh Sayar became the Mughal Emperor, Hussain Ali Syed summoned Shyamsingh Khangarot and after talking to him gave Jai Singh the mansab of 5000 Jat 4500 riders from the emperor
 jab atsingh kaa badshaah ke saath matbhed ho gaya, tab badshaah ne saiyad hossain ali ko sena lekar ajmer bheja jahaan atsingh ne kabja kar liya tha
 Jai Singh was also with Hussain Ali Syed at that time
 ant main atsingh se sandhi hui
 In October 1713, the emperor Farrukh Sier granted him the subdivision of Malwa
 inhone vahaan kii anek bagawatein dabaai va marahathon ke updrav bhi kuchle
 When a large army of Marhtas entered Malwa, they defeated him very hard near Palsud

 Jaisingh attacked him at night
 inaki sena ko dekhte hi ve bhaag nikle va narvada nadi paar kar gayi
 All the goods of his loot remained there

 In 1715, he was called to Delhi
 tab inaki anupasthiti main inke dhabhai ruparam ko inhone vahaan naayab bana kar rakhaa
 He remained the Subedar of Malwa till 1717
 badshaah farrukh sier ne bhimsingh hada raja kota ko bundi kii riyasat de di thi or usne bundi par kabja bhi kar liya tha
 Jaisingh tried to get the Bundi back from the emperor to King Budhsinh Hada
 dilli se badshaah ne inako bharatpur ke chudaaman jat par chadhaai karne kii ajna di, jisane agra ke ilaake main luutmaar se bada updrav machaa rakhaa tha
 Along with them, Buddha Singh of Bundi, Bhimsingh of Kota, Gaj Singh of Narwar, Durgadas Rathore and many other mansabdars were also appointed
 15 sitambar 1716 ko ye apni fouj le kar mathura ke liye ravaanaa hue
 In November, the famous fort of Chudaman started the enclosure of Thun
 var abdulla khan saiyad, jaisingh ke viruddh tha tathaa chudaaman ko madad de rahaa tha
 This did not make them successful in this campaign
 var abdulla khan saiyad ne ant main bich main pad kar thun kaa gheraa uthva liya
 Jaisingh returned to Delhi in May 1718
 chudaman ke ilaake main is asafalataa ke baavjood badshaah ne inkaa bada sammaan kiya
 Swords were drawn between the Sayyids and the Emperors
 jaisingh ne badshaah farrukh sier ko bahut samajhaayaa ki saiyadon se yuddh karke unhen hameshaa ke liye saaf kar dena chahie
 At that time, 20 thousand Rajput riders were present in Delhi and Buddha Singh Hada of Bundi was also with them
 parantu badshaah kii yah sainya kaarywai karne kii himmat nahin hui
 He kept trying to please the Syed
 ant main saiyadon ne badshaah se jaisingh ko dilli se jane ko kahalava diya
 Jaisingh warned the emperor that his departure would threaten the emperor's life, but this advice was not understood by the emperor
 13 farvari 1719 i0 ko jaisingh dilli se ravaanaa hue
 a few hours after that, Bhimsingh Kota Raja attacked Budhsinh Bundi
 unke swamibhakt sardaar jaitsingh ne badi veerta se kota kii sena ko roka tathaa budhsingh ko surakshit vahaan se nikaal diya
 They ran away and reached Sawai Jai Singh
 17- 18 april ko saiyad bhaaiyon, atsingh jodhpur or bhimsingh kota ne mil kar dilli main badshaah farrukhsier ko maar daalaa
 Jaisingh also corresponded with the Subedar Chhabila Ram of Allahabad and the Nizam against the Sayyids
 ve chaahate the ki sab mil kar saiyadon ko apdasth kar den
 He also called Chhatrasal Bundela for war
 saiyadon ne kai senaayen inke viruddh kai taraf se gherne ke liye bhejin| var abdulla khan ne 5 july ko nammaatr ke badshaah rafiudulla ko saath lekar jaisingh par chadhaai kii or mathura hota hua vah agra pahunchaa, jahaan saiyadon ke viruddh baghawat ho rahi thi
 Jaisingh too had prepared to face the Syed in full force, but before leaving for the war, he summoned the Brahmins and donated them to the Amer kingdom and, wearing a saffron bana, he left to fight the Syed
 ye amer se aage bad kar toda risingh tak pahunch gayi the
 But both Nizam and Chhabilaram did not stand in their favor as promised
 jaisingh ko niraashaa haath lagi
 Finally, At Singh took Jaisingh with him to Jodhpur where he married his daughter to Jaisingh
 saiyadon ne jaisingh ko 20 lakh rupee diye, jisase ve amer vaapis brahmanon se waapas khariden
 Even at that time, Jai Singh did not believe in At Singh Jodhpur, so he wore Jirhabkhtar even in his marriage
 saiyadon kii do senaayen jab dakshin main nizaam se parrast ho gai, tab hossain ali khan saiyad, badshaah mohammad shah ko saath le kar, ek badi sena ke saath nizaam ko dabaane ke liye ravaanaa hua
 On September 8, 1720, at Todabhim, he deceitfully killed Hussain Ali

 For this war, Maharana asked Jaisingh, 'what should he do?' Jaisingh wrote a letter to Maharana of Udaipur to help the emperor and also sent letters to Bikaner, Kota and Rao Indrasingh Nagaur besides Maharana to help the emperor
 savai jaisingh ne khud badshaah mohammad shah kii madad ke liye raav jagraam ke saath ek acchhee sena bheji

 Sardar
 3 or 4 navambar 1720 ko yuddh hua jisamen saiyad abdulla khan pakadaa gaya
 After the victory, the emperor gave the Jaipur chieftains with his hands
 mohammad shah ne dilli pahunchate hi jaisingh ko dilli aane kaa farmaan bheja jisamen likhaa ki unase anek mahatvapurn samasyaon par salaah leni he
 When he reached Delhi, the emperor sent his new groom Muhammad Amin Khan to his tent
 darbar main aane par badshaah ne unka bada satkar kiya or anek tohfe die
 4000 riders were added to their mansab
 isi maukey par inhen do karod rupee inhen inaam / bakhshish main diye jinako inhone namratapurvak lene se manaa kar diya
 But the emperor waived the hard jaziya imposed on Hindus at the request of Sawai Jai Singh and King Girdhar Bahadur
 maharana mewar ne jajia hatwa dene kii safalataa par savai jaisingh ko apni or se prasann ho kar likhit badhai bheji
 After the fall of the Sayyids, Jaisingh's political importance began to grow rapidly
 rajasthan, malwa or bundelkhand ke raja har musiibat main unase sahaayta or salaah chaahate the
 There was nothing in these areas without their opinion
 1735 i0 ke baad to marahathe bhi inaki salaah lene tathaa inako aadar dene lag gaye
 Apart from Sawai, the other titles given by the Mughal emperors from time to time were - sarmade-raja-e-hind ' / ' Rajarajeshwar ' / ' Srirajadhiraj etc
 sitambar 1722 i0 main jaisingh ko agra kaa soobedaar bana kar jaaton ko dabaane ko bheja gaya
 There was a large army of 50 thousand soldiers with them and many mansabdars were also with them
 shahi topakhana bhi inke saath tha
 Mohudam Singh, son of Chudaman Jat, was the leader of Jats at this time
 parantu chudaaman kaa bhatija badansingh jo usase naaraaz tha, jaisingh se aa kar mila
 He gave him a big welcome
 ek baar phir inhone thun ke kile par gheraa daalaa
 At Singh Joghpur sent an army to help Mohammad Singh, but she did not advance to Jobner
 vibhishana kii tarah badansingh kii salaah se thun ke kile kaa vijay hona nishchit dikh rahaa tha
 Frustrated, Singh left the fort by secret route and reached Jodhpur near Atar Singh
 kintu jaaton ke thun sthit kile par savai jaisingh kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 He gave the Jagir of Bharatpur to Surajmal's father Badansingh and tied his turban as a king

 Badansingh used to visit the Dussehra court of Jaipur every year
 jaipur main jahaan jat sena sahit deeg ke raja kaa padaav lagata tha, vah sthaan ab bhi baas badanpura kehalaata he
 Possibly the greatest and grand task of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh's tenure was the establishment of the Jaipur city in 1727
 isaki neenv pus vadi 1 vi
 san
 1784, i0 ko rakhi gai
 Rajguru Emperor Jagannath took out a muhurat to lay the foundation of the new city and got the Bhoomi worship done
 maharaja kii ajna ke anusaar nae nagar kaa nakshaa dewan vidyadhar ne banaaya jo bahut pratibhashali bengali brahman tha or inke lekha-vibhaag kii seva main naayab-ankekshak tha
 In 1733, this city, named Sawai Jaisingh, was named as 'sawai Jayanagar'
 jaisingh ko mogul badshaah dwaara malwa kaa dubaara soobedaar banaaya gaya
 He left for Ujjain on 23 October 1729 AD
 jaisingh apane rajya kii suraksha ke liye vidrohi marahathon se samjhauta karnaa chaahate the
 This compromise proposal was accepted by the emperor
 inaki is vijay par sahu se likhaa padhi hui
 Sahu was ready for this, but the Peshwa people were not much in favor of this agreement
 inhone deepasingh kumbhani ko sahu ke paas satara bheja
 While returning, Deep Singh also met the Nizam, but in September 1730, his agreement with Malwa was not resolved
 buddhasingh bundi or unki kushwahi rani ke aapas main gambhir matbhed paidaa hone par jaisingh ke sambandh bhi bundi naresh buddhasingh se bahut kharaab ho gayi
 In the end, the relations deteriorated so much that Jai Singh made the King of Bundi the king of Salim Singh Hada of Karwar in place of Buddha Singh, and called him the king, and later married his daughter
 isse rajasthan main jaipur or bundi ke bich lambe samay tak bada du:khad sangharsh chalaa
 With this mutual estrangement, the Marathas again got the opportunity to intervene in Rajasthan
 jaisingh ko 1730 i0 main malwa main ittala mili ki buddhasingh phir se bundi par adhikaar karne ja rahe hai
 He sent an army to Dalel Singh's help
 On 6 April 1730, the Jaipur Army fought with Budh Singh at Kushtal Pancholas in which five Rajawat chieftains of Jaipur, Fathas Singh Sarsop Khojuram, Sanvaldas, Achal Singh and Ghasiram Achre were killed
 
 Buddha Singh did not get victory in this war
 malwa se lautate samay maharaja savai jaisingh kushattal pancholas gayi
 He beheaded the killed chieftains and gave siropaav to their sons
 jaisingh disambar 1732 main teesri baar malwa praant ke soobedaar banakar ujjain gayi
 This time in Malwa also, the number of marhtas had increased so much that their efforts to remove the marines from Malwa failed
 1734 i0 main khandaura ek badi sena lekar raajapootaana hota hua malwa main marathon ke viruddh aage aayaa
 Many kings like Jai Singh, Abhay Singh etc
 were with him
 jab yah vishaal sena rampura pahaunchi to use maratha mili
 But after sparing battles, they ditched them and entered Rajasthan from behind
 vahaan unako rokane vaala koi nahin tha or ve marathe jaipur rajya main sambhars tak lutpaat karte chale gayi
 In 1735, Peshwa Bajirao's mother came to the north to do pilgrimage
 maharaja jaisingh ne uskaa bada aadar-satkar kiya tathaa maharana se bhi uskaa satkar karavaaya
 In Agra, his Naib Subedar sent his Diwan Aaymal's brother Narayandas to welcome him and accompany him to Poona
 janvari 1737 i0 ko peshwa uttar bharat main aayaa uske saath holkar, sindhiya, panvaar aadi sabhi the
 While coming from Udaipur, Maharaja Jaisingh met Peshwa on 25 February in Jhadli village of Malpura region

 His and new Peshwa Bala Rao met in Dholpur
 inke prayaas se badshaah ne peshwa ko malwa kii naayab soobedaari de di
 When Nadirshah came to India, everyone was very skeptical
 peshwa, maharana anya raajaaon va bundelon ko mila kar jaisingh, nadirshah kaa sangathit muqabla karnaa chaah rahaa tha
 However, on 24 February 1739, he defeated the Mughal army badly in Karnal
 yah bhi afvaah thi ki nadirshah jaipur hota hua ajmer jayega
 This was also a big danger for Jai Singh
 sab chaukanne the, lekin ant main vah mathura se hi waapas apane desh laut gaya
 "when Nadirshah attacked India, Jaisingh did not go to Delhi for help
 is kaa kaaran yah tha- tab nizaam or kamruddin us samay samrajya main ucch padon par the or nadirshah ke hamale ke liye ve log inke uttaradaayi hone kaa shaq kar sakate the, kintu samraat baraabar inamen vishwaas rakh kar inase aavashyak paraamarsh karata rahaa

 caliph arabi bhashaa main aise shaasha ko kehete hai jo kisi islamic rajya yaa anya sharia se chalane vaali rajkeey vyavastha kaa shaasha ho
 The caliphs after the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD were considered political leaders of the entire Muslim region
 caliphaaon kaa silsilaa ant main jaakar osmani samrajya ke patan par 1925 main hi khatm hua
 The word 'khalifa' in Arabic means 'representative' or 'successor'
 pigambar mohammad kii 632 isvi main mrityu ke baad puure muslim jagat kii rajnatik bagdor sanbhaalane waalon ko 'caliph rasul allaah' kaha jaataa tha, yani 'allaah ke rasul kaa uttaradhikari'
 Just as the kingdom of 'nobles' was called 'princely', the kingdom of 'rich' was called 'emirate' and the kingdom of 'khan' was called 'khanat', similarly the rule of 'khalifa' was called 'khilafat'
 'caliph' main 'kh' akshar ke uccharan par dhyaan den kyonki yah bina bindu vaale 'kha' se zaraa bhinn he
 It is pronounced with 'khab' and 'kha' for 'khad'
 pigambar mohammad ke dehanth ke baad ke pehle chaar caliphaaon ko sunni mat ke anuyaayi 'raashidi caliph' kehete hai, jise arabi lahaze main 'caliph ur-rashidun' or farsi lahaze main 'caliph-e-raashidin' bhi kehete hai
 'rashid' means 'one who walks on the right track' in Arabic
 yah chaar caliph is prakaar the: abu bakar as-siddiq, umr ebn al-khattab, osman ebn affaan or ali ebn abu talib
 These four were his companions during Muhammad's lifetime
 pigambar mohammad ke guzarane ke turant baad aapasi baatcheet se abu bakar ko caliph chunaa gaya or mohammad ke saathiyon ne unase vafadaari kii shapath lee
 Some people were angry with this election because they thought that Ali was the closest relative of the Prophet, so he should have become the Khalifa
 abu bakar kaa shashan 632 se 634 keval do saal hi chalaa tha ki ve biimaar pade or mrityodasha par aa pahunche
 Before his death, he made Umar Khalifa without consulting him
 umr se vafadaari kii shapath keval unhi saathiyon ne lee jo us samay madina main the, jis se kuch anya saathiyon ne unhen caliph maanane se anakani kerani shuru kar di
 At that time, the Arabs attacked Iran for spreading Islam, and enraged by this, some Iranians killed Omar on November 7, 644, about 10 years after taking power
 umr ne pehle hi chah logon kaa ek gut banaaya tha jisamen se aapasi samjhaute se unhone ek ko chunakar caliph bananaa tha
 This included Ali and Usman
 osman ko chunaa gaya or ve 11 navambar 644 tisare caliph bane
 About 12 years later, on 17 July 656, he was also murdered by some rebels and Ali was elected the fourth Khalifa
 shiya anuyaayion kaa mat he ki pehle teen caliphaaon kaa raaj najayas tha or shuru se hi ali ko caliph hona chahie tha kyonki ve pigambar ke paariwarik rishtedaar bhi the or unki beti fatima ke pati bhi
 When Ali became Khalifa, there was a lot of disturbance and stigma
 sabe badi chunauti damishq ke rajyapal muawiyah se ai jo osman ke rishtedaar the or jinaki bahan se pigambar mohammad ne vivaah kiya tha
 Mu'awiyah said that Ali is not catching the slaves of his relative Usman
 unhone furaat nadi ke kinare ali kii faujon ke saath 'sifin kaa yuddh' chhedaa jisamen kisi kii jeet-haar na hui
 Ali agreed to negotiate with Mu'awiyah to stop the bloodshed
 ali kii faujon main 4,000 kattarpanthi logon kaa gut tha jo 'kaariji' kehalaate the or jinka yah kadaa mat tha ki haar-jeet kaa nirnay keval ishwar ke haath main he or marate dam tak yah yuddh nahin rokna chahie
 They split from him, accusing Ali of deviating from the right path
 lagbhag do saal baad 'naharvaan ke yuddh' main ali ko kaarigiyon se ladanaa padaa jisamen ali kii jeet hui
 After this, one day he was offering prayers in the mosque of Kufa when he was attacked by a Khariji named 'ibn Muljam' with a poisoned sword
 ve guzar gaye
 One of his two sons - Hasan and Hussain - was to be elected the Khalifa, as Prophet Muhammad was the maternal grandfather of both, and Ali instructed that the latter Khalifa should belong to the Prophet's household
 hasan ko chatha caliph banaaya gaya lekin unke caliph banate hi muawiyah ne unki faujon ko unke viruddh bhadakaana shuru kar diya
 The war between Hasan and Mu'awiyah became a condition
 muslim samudaay ko bantane se rokane ke liye hasan ne samjhauta kiya ki ve caliph kii gaddi tyaag denge or muawiyah ko caliph sweekaar lenge basharte muawiyah kii mrityu ke baad gaddi waapas hasan yaa unke uttaradhikari ko mili
 Mu'awiyah became the seventh Khalifa, but she wished that her son Yazid would become Khalifa
 kaha jaataa he ki muawiyah ne hasan kii kisi patni ko uksaakar hasan ko zehar khilvaaya jis se hasan kii mrityu ho gai
 When Mu'awiyah died in 680, his son Yazid declared the eighth Khalifa
 ali ke dusre bete hossain ne yah maanane se inkaar kar diya
 On 10 October 680, the 'war of Karbala' took place in which Husain was beheaded
 phir unke 6 maheene kii umr ke bete ko maaraa gaya or unke parivaar kii striyon kaa apmaan kiya gaya
 Every year Shia people consider these incidents in Muharram as mourning

 Therefore, their views are being made differently
 vanaspatiyon main janan kii pramukh vidhiyaan - In botanical reproduction, a botanical part originates a new tree and starts a new life, separated from the parent plant
 iske do prakaar, ek prakritik or doosraa kritrim, hai
 It is of the following type: kuch paudhon kaa janan kritrim reeti se bhi hota he
 Some plants produce new plants through clipping of stems, some plants by tying pens and some by pressing pens
 alangik janan main vishesh prakaar kii koshikaaye, bina kisi duusari ikai se mili hi, nae paudhon ko utpann karti hai
 It is caused by fragmentation method or spore formation
 pehali vidhi se hi shaiwal, kavak or bijaanuon aadi kaa janan evam vardhan hota he
 The second method is reproduction by spores
 bijaanu ekkosiya or bahut sookshm hote hai
 Some algae, waterfowl and fungi have spores that are made only of protoplasm
 inamen lomak hote hai
 Such spores are called chalujanu
 ye chaljanu lomak kii sahaayta se tairte hai or shuddhjaleey praaniyon kii bhanti baad main nae paudhon main badal jate hai
 In some substances, such as Eulothrax chalgensis, it is produced in greater numbers and in saprolagnia
 kuch shaiwalon, jaise naustock main, bijanutantu kii koshikaon se achal bijaanu utpann hote hai, jo hawa se udakar failte hai
 Spores are produced by spores, which contain both males and females
 ye paraspar milakar yugmak-su banate hai, jinase phir bijaanu or unase bijanujanak banate hai
 In more developed plants, sexual reproduction occurs by fruits and seeds
 unke phulon main nar gamit or maadaa gamit hote hai, jinke sayujya se yugmak banate hai
 These develop into embryos inside the seed, sprouting and giving rise to new plants
 gamit bahut sookshm or eckoshikeey hote hai
 Sexual reproduction requires two different parents
 kabhi-kabhi ek hi prakaar ke do gamit milakar janan karte hai
 The meeting of such union is called
 do vibhinn gamiton ke milane ko nishechan kehete hai
 Algae and fungi resemble germination in lower grade plants and fertilization in higher grade plants
 jin paudhon ke gamit main nar or maadaa kaa vibhed nahin hota unhen samayugmak kehete hai or aise paudhon ko samayugmi 
 What makes male and female together in fertilization is the spermatozoa, the Assam gametes of the gametes and the plant is called asaugamia or miscellaneous flowers
 janan kii uparyukt vidhiyon ke atirikt kuch anya vidhiyon, jaise ajeevanujanan, apyugmajanan or asechan janan se bhi janan hota he
 The methods of reproduction in animals can be divided into two categories, asexual and sexual
 inamen bhed yah he ki alangik vidhi se janan ke liye keval ek hi janak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or janakakoshika tathaa santankoshika kaa vibhaajan samasutran se hi hota he

 He gave this revolutionary formula that the Earth is not in the center of space
 nicholas pehle europi khagolashastri the jinhone prithvi ko brahmand ke kendra se baahar mana, yani heliosentrism model ko lagu kiya
 Before this, the whole Europe believed in the concept of Aristotle, in which the earth was the center of the universe and the sun, stars and other bodies revolved around it

 All theoretical and applied aspects of measurement are studied in metrology or metrology

 Metrology is the branch of physics in which we have knowledge about pure measurement

 Non-invariant standards are not only instructed by metrology, but they are also upheld

 The other side is that keeping in view a particular function, metrology provides ways in which comparisons can be made to a very high degree of accuracy

 tarang dairghy prakritik maanak ke rup main -- baad kii pragati ne kaaphi had tak hamaari manyataon main parivartan laa diya he
 First, scientist Michelson's experiments established a natural standard, the wavelength of, which is unanimously assumed that this standard is reproducible with at least as high a level of accuracy as is found in comparisons of fluid parameters
 lekin is maanak kii sarvotkrisht visheshta yah he ki yah dirghakaalik vicharan kii sambhaavna se pare he, jabaki anya sabhi prakaar ke maanakon kaa hi prayog hota he
 In any part of the earth, we can verify fluid parameters with the help of this natural standard
 yadi dravyatmak maanakon ko antarrashtriya kendriya prayogshaala main bhejkar adiprarup meter se tulana karaani hoti he, to avaagaman main use haani pahunchne kii sambhaavna rahati he, kintu prakritik maanak kii sahaayta se ham apni hi prayogshaala main yah kaary kar sakate hai
 The second is that such reforms led to the development of flat-headed standards
 aajkal aise dand bhi prapya hai jinke sire ekadam samaantar hai
 The lengths of such punishments are derived directly from optical interference rather than from the linear standard
 micelson ke vyatikaranmaapi kaa upyog is baat ko jaanane main bhi kiya gaya ki ek maanak meter main kitni prakaash kii tarangen aati he tathaa unki sankhya kya he? micelson ne 150 centegrade taap tathaa 760 mimi0 vayumandal ke dabaav par antarrashtriya meter kaa, jo paris ke paas maap or taul ke antarrashtriya santhaan main rakhaa hua he, maan cadmium kii laal taragon main, gyaat kiya

 fabri paro ke baad ke prayogon se gyaat hua ki 15° sein0 tathaa 760 millimetre dabaav par shushk hawa main ek meter main yah sankhya 15,53,164

 If Michaelsson's experiments are modified to have the effect of water vapor, it is clear that there is no difference in the value of the two

 The experiments of Michelson and Fabry Para have also proved this
 inaki tulana kaa aadhaar cadmium kii laal rekha thi
 All standard meters of matter are made of an alloy, which consists of 90% platinum and 10% metal called iridium
 is prakaar main metron ko aadharbhoot maanakon ke liye sabase santoshprad mana jaataa he
 In many works, where the problem of very accurate measurement arises, it is necessary that we treat such a material whose thermal expansion is nominal

 It is a alloy of nickel and steel, which contains 36% nickel

 The second material is fused silica, whose diffusion coefficient is very low

 The standard meter of fused silica is the shape of a tube, with parallel banding at the end

 As far as this standard is known, there has been no change in its length

 This alloy has been used in the manufacture of 'state standard pound' and 'international etc
 type kilogram'
 kai varshon ke baad jab kilogram kii vibhinn rashtriya pratiyon kii pun: tulana kii gai, to yah gyaat hua ki sthirataa kaa str 108 main ek bhaag tak he
 This reflects not only the accuracy of the standards but also the completeness of comparisons
 ek doosraa dravya, jisamen sanhati kii ucch str kii sthirataa pai jaati he, crystal quartz kehalaata he
 The errors in this are that its density is relatively low and it is absorbent
 hawa main sanhati ke maanakon kii tulana karte samay ye maanak vaayu ke vibhinn aaytanon ko hataate hai
 Therefore, consideration of upper buoyancy effect must be taken in comparing the standards of the code
 yadi maanak kaa ghanatv kam hoga, to utplavan sanshodhan zyada hoga
 The accuracy achieved in comparison to platinum-iridium standards is based on the fact that their density is not only very high but very close
 iske kaaran utplavan sanshodhan bahut hi kam hota he
 Buoyancy modification arises as a problem in comparison to weights whose density varies greatly, such as platinum, quartz, and brass, etc
 is dosha ko dur karne ke liye vayurahit vaataavaran main taulnaa aavashyak he
 In daily business activities, weighing is done in the air and the difference due to buoyancy in the weights and goods is negligible from the business point of view
 nireekshak vyapaarik baaton kii tulana ke liye pital ke, jiskaa ghanatv 8

 Even when we do not weigh in an airless environment, the balance of the bent should be good, the method of application should be efficient and alert for proper comparison of the primary parameters of mass
 tula ke shunya pathnaank ko sthir rakhane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki tapasthirataa main atyant saavdhaanee barti jaay
 Therefore, the room in which the balance is kept, it is necessary to control the temperature in a structural manner and the inspector should do the weighing work from outside the room, or it should be weighed from some distance

 If a very high degree of purity is required, it is necessary that the pedicle of the weft is completely disguised by magnetic effects and the weigher is placed in an iron box

 mishael phuko france ke pramukh vichaarak or darshanik the
 Fuco is counted among the most prominent thinkers of the 20th century
 yah phuko ke lekhon kaa hi prabhaav tha ki aadhunik vigyaan ke bahut se kshetron main or khaskar itihaas lekhan ke kshetra main krantikari parivartan huye
 Michel Fuco has made the most recent and thoughtful development in the understanding of how the state's institution asks people to speak
 poonjipati varg rajya main apni saamaajik satta keval hinsa ke upkarnon ke dwaara hi sthapit nahin karata
 He also ensures continuity of his social power by using a variety of cultural forms
 isliye rajya kii sanrachanaon ko unke saanskrithik roopon main samajhnaa bhi aavashyak he
 Ultimately, these cultural structures bear the responsibility of creating consensus in favor of the state
 phuko bataate hai ki aadhunik samaaj main logon ko niyantrit yaa anushaasit karne ke liye nigaraanee kii ek bahustareey vyavastha ke alaava dusron dwaara kiye gayi nirnyon ko aatmsaat karne tathaa pariksha pranali jaise upaay apanaaye jate hai
 Fuko insists that just keeping an eye on the people completes half the power
 iske liye ve stadium kii vyavastha kaa hawala dete hai jisamen siton kii vyavastha is tarah kii jaati he ki darshak kisi kaarykram ko aasaani se dekh paayen par saath hi yah vyavastha satta ke niyantrakon ko darshakon par nigaah rakhane kii sahuuliyat bhi pradaan karti he
 Fuco also mentions the prison punopticon conceived by political thinker Jeremy Bentham to mark the model of power of discipline and control
 jisaki mul vaastu-yojana kuch aisi thi ki kothriyon main band kaidi ek duusare ke liye to adrishy rahen lekin jail ke kendriya tower kii nigaraanee se baahar na ho paayen
 Prisoners never get to know whether they are being monitored or not, but there is a thought in their minds that someone keeps an eye on them
 phuko panoptican ke siddhant ko ek aise roopak kii tarah dekhte hai jo jail kii chauhaddi ke paar jaakar skulon, kaarkaanon or aspataalon main anushaasan kaa aam dharra ban jaataa he
 Although this proposed prison of Bantham was never able to materialize, but as a theory, it has occupied almost every activity of modern society
 aadhunik samaaj main anushaasan kaayam karne vaali vyavasthaaon ke liye vah ek aisa aujaar siddh hui he jisane praaq-aadhunik kaal ke raajaaon or hakimon ko apdasth kar unki jagah khud ko sthapit kar liya he
 In this sequence, Fuko also shows that the system governing modern power or discipline does not only monitor the activities of the people but also controls the people by showing their incompetence
 unke anusaar aadhunik satta samaj, pratibha, saamaanya or asaamaanya vyavhaar jaisi kotiyon kaa nirmaan karti he or jab koi vyakti iske dwaara sthapit kasautiyon yaa maanakon par karaa nahin utarataa to vyavastha aise vyakti ko kamatar yaa asaamaanya ghoshit karne kaa mauka nahin chookti
 In this context, Fuku does not forget to remind that this attitude of these disciplinary institutions of modern society is not driven by any kind of vengeance but by reform
 jiskaa antim lakshya yah hota he ki vyakti samaaj kii pradutt kasautiyon yaa maanakon ko sweekaar kar le
 Note that this method of discipline by the beliefs of the society is quite different from that system of judicial punishment in which a person was punished only on the basis of whether his act is lawful or not
 aise kisi faisale main yah nahin kaha jaataa tha ki vyakti saamaanya he yaa asaamaanya
 But modern society insists on setting certain standards in the matters of educational programs, medical practices and industry and products, and the dominance of these standards is so all-round that the behavior and personality of the individual starts to change accordingly
 saamanytah rajya ko shashan, sanghathan yaa raajnneetik samudaay ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 It is believed that its various forms have existed in every phase of history
 isamen hone vaale badlaav itihaas ke pramukh vishay rahe hai
 Only primitive nomadic political communities are not given the status of the state
 mana jaataa he ki in samudaayon main is avadharana ke saath- saath usase judi sunishchit vyavastha kaa abhaav hota he
 In fact, to be a state, it is necessary that there is a permanent relationship between the community and the territory
 is saamaanya tareeke se upyog kiye jane par yah shabd is vichaar ko abhivyakt karata he ki raajnneetik samudaay kii kuch aisi nishchit saarvbhaumik visheshtaayen hoti hai, jo samay or sthaan se pare hoti hai; arthath greek polis, madhyayugin regnum or aadhunik ganatantron ke bich kuch saamaanya visheshta hai
 Can this property or feature be defined more narrowly? yah baat to spasht he ki yadi rajya kii koi paribhaasha ise shaashvat or aparivartansheel vastu yaa sanghathan ke rup main pesh karti he, to aisa karke vah itihaas main badlaav or vikaas kii prakriya kii upeksha karti he
 Therefore a valid definition should focus on other aspects and functions
 itihaas yah dikhaata he ki ek saarvbhaumik parighatna ke rup main rajya ek aisi gatividhi yaa sanghathan he, jo manushya par aavashyaktaaon ke rup main thopi gayi he
 Some of its main features as an activity of this kind are as follows: It creates a definite connection between humans and their possessions; Or in other words it creates unity or society among humans
 isliye rajya kaa astitv vishisht taur par ek buniyadi chiz he
 Second, it accepts the connection between humans with the power of order, or a form of rule or command and obedience
 teesraa, rajya ko banane or kaayam rakhane vaali gatividhi vishisht hoti he, jo hameshaa khud ko un logon ke kilaaf pesh karti he, jo is samudaay kaa bhaag nahin hote hai
 However, despite seeing the state as a historical phenomenon, it cannot be denied that a philosophical aspect has always been involved in the writing on it
 iske tahat prashn uthta he ki rajya jis tarah kii vyavastha yaa logon ke bich sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta he, uskaa adarsh rup kya he? kya vah adarsh rup hasil kar liya gaya he? kya shashan kaa vartmaan tarika sahi he? kya samudaay ke bahari sambandhon ko sahi tareeke se sanchalit kiya ja rahaa he? asal main, is najariye se vichaar karne par rajya sirf manushyon par thopi gayi aavashyaktaa ke rup main hi saamne nahin aata he, balki yah manushyon ke saamne ‘sahi’ ke chunaav kii samasya ke rup main bhi saamne aata he
 There is no struggle to establish a system instead of just anarchy in the state
 isaki bajaay, yah ek aisi vyavastha sthapit karne kaa bhi sangharsh he, jo sachhee, pramanik or nyaaypurna ho
 Therefore, the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Hegel etc
 can be seen as an attempt to find a philosophical answer to the question of what the kingdom should be like
 in vidwaanon ne rajya or duusare tarah ke maanav- sanghathanon ke bich antar karne kii koshish kii he or iske saath hi inhone apane adarsh rajya kii pariklpana or uske paksh main tark bhi prastut kiye hai
 There is also a need to connect the idea of the state as a universal historical phenomenon and the idea of the state as a philosophical concept, especially the modern phenomenon
 aise bahut se itihaaskaar or raajnneetik sidghantkaar hai, jo yah tark dete hai ki ‘rajya’ shabd kaa upyog europe main punarjagran or dharm-sudhaar ke baad saamne aayi vyavastha ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 They believe that the principle of the state is in fact linked to this specific phenomenon
 isliye yadi iskaa prayog itihaas ke duusare daur main maujuud sanghathanon ke liye kiya jaataa he, to isse iske arth ke bare main bhram badhegaa
 The term state as an organized system also arose between the end of the fourteenth century and the seventeenth century
 rajya kaa angrezi shabd ‘state’ latin shabd ‘stair’ se niklaa he, jiskaa arth he khadaa hona
 In this way it tells about a situation
 rajya ko ek aadhunik avadharana maanane ke peeche ek mukhya vichaar yah bhi he ki aadhunik rajya kaa ubhaar prabhusatta kii avadharana ke saath hua
 It is a clear modern belief that a state which is not sovereign, is not a state in the true sense
 prabhusatta kaa arth yah he ki rajya apane adhikaar main aane vaale bhu-kshetra main raajnneetik praadhikaar kaa sarvocch strot he
 Sovereignty has two aspects - the internal aspect and the external aspect
 aantarik pahalu kaa arth he ki rajya kii simaaon ke bheetar rajya se unchaa koi bhi praadhikari nahin he
 The state is supreme and the citizen cannot appeal against any other authority against the state
 bahari prabhusatta kaa arth he— kisi vishisht rajya ko duusare rajyon dwaara di jane vaali manyata
 Also, it also accepts that a state can speak on behalf of its citizens in international affairs
 yah adhikaar antarrashtriya daayre main rajya kii swaittata or prabhusatta ko vyakt karata he
 To consider the state as a modern phenomenon does not mean that it should also be dismissed as a historical entity or a philosophical idea
 yah bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik rajya kii koi bhi visheshta itihaas ke pehle ke daur main maujuud nahin thi
 In fact, many of the characteristics of the earlier 'states' of the modern era and the 'states' encountered with the modern era are similar
 isi tarah, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki ek darshanik vichaar ke rup main rajya aadhunik rajya kii ‘purna avadharana’ kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 In fact, philosophically, the concept of the state has been conceived and discussed in different ways
 masalan, udaarataavaadiyon ne rajyon ko ek ‘tatasth’ sanstha ke rup main dekha, lekin rajya kii bhoomika ke bare main udaarataavaad ke bheetar gambheer or vividh charchaa hoti rahi he
 Even within Marxism, there is a rich tradition of debate over the state
 isamen rajya ko poonjipati virgon kaa saadhan maanane ke saath hi ‘rajya kii saapekshik swaittata’ se judaa vaad-vivaad bhi shaamil rahaa he
 Anarchists have considered the state as an unnatural power and advocated its complete abolition
 marks-angels ke lekhan main bhi ek aisi samyavaadee sthiti kii kalpana kii gayi he, jisamen rajya puri tarah khatm ho jaayegaa
 But instead of waiting for such a situation, anarchists want to end the state as soon as possible
 inkaa maananaa he ki rajya manushya kii swaabhaavik prakruti ke kilaaf hinsa par aadhaarit he
 On the other hand, conservatives favor the state so that it can preserve the traditions and values accumulated over many generations
 nariwadiyon ke bheetar kii vibhinn dhaaraon main rajya ke bare main alag-alag tarah se vichaar kiya gaya he
 For example, liberal-feminism holds that the state as an institution is inclined towards male supremacy, but this trend of the state can be improved by making laws and using it to establish male-female equality
 can be done
 duusari ore, samaajawaadee-nariwad rajya ke poonjeewaadi charitra ko mahilaon kii samasya kaa mukhya kaaran maanata he
 It is believed that only the end of capitalist state can improve the condition of women
 teesraa, radical nariwadi vichaar ke mutabik rajya pitrusatta par aadhaarit parivaar or uske dwaara aage badhaaye jane vaale mulyon kii hifaazat kaa kaam karata he
 Therefore, to completely eliminate patriarchy, it is necessary to abolish the state
 spasht taur par, rajya, isaki prakruti or bhoomika ke bare main bahut vividh or gahan vaad-vivaad he
 In recent times, it has been argued that the state is slowly becoming irrelevant due to the emergence of structures like the European Union
 lekin yah tark bahut majboot nahin he
 It is true that the countries involved in the European Union have given their consent to form a strong regional organization
 phir bhi, ve ek raashtra-rajya ke rup main apni-apni pahchaan khatm nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Many other regional organizations have also increased cooperation between the countries of the region, but there is no possibility that they will prove to be an alternative to the nation-state
 samakaleen duniya main rajya ek aisi hakeekat he, jiske khatm hone kaa koi asaar nahin he
 Followers of many ideologies opposing it ideologically have failed to finish the institution of the state even if given a practical opportunity

 sohani bhi uski taraf aakarshith ho gai
 He started working in Sohni's father's house, his name became Mahiwal, as he started grazing buffalo
 jab unke prem ke kisse aasapaas faile to tula ne sohani ko bina bataae uski shaadi kisi kumhaar se kar di
 Mahiwal forgot his home, country and became mystic
 magar donon premiyon ne milanaa na chhoda
 Every day, when the whole world slept at night, she would wait for Mahiwal across the Sohni river, who would swim near her
 mahivaal biimaar hua to sohani ek pakke ghade kii madad se tairkar usase milane pahunchane lagi
 Once her sister-in-law saw them, she put a raw pitcher in place of a pucca watch

 On the way, the gang of dacoits collided and the gang headman told him that Maru had been married elsewhere
 yah dakait bhi maaru se ekatarfa prem karata tha
 Dhola was determined to meet Maru
 antat: vah maaru se milane pahunch gaya
 But the sufferings had not ended yet
 lautate hue registan ke saanp ne maaru ko das liya or vah gahan murchhavastha main chali gai
 For the first time in Rajput history, Dhola wanted to sati herself with the wife's pyre
 isi bich ek yogi-yogini ne kaha ki vah maaru ko jivit kar sakate hai
 He resurrected Maru
 donon phir mahal ko lautne lage, tabhi dakaiton kaa sardaar unhen maarane aa gaya, lekin lok gayakon ne unhen bachaa liya
 Eventually, he was able to return to his palace, becoming a happy love story after many sorrows
 faras kii prishthbhumi main janmi is kahani kaa paatr farhaad ek shilpkaar tha, jo rajkumaari shirin se beintahaa muhabbat karata tha, lekin rajkumaari is prem se anbhigya thi
 Frustrated, Farhad started living in the hills and playing the tunes in praise of the princess on the flute
 jab yah baat shirin ko maaloom hui to vah farhaad se mili or uske prem main giraft ho gai
 Sheerin's father and king did not want their daughter to marry a common man
 aakhir unhone apni beti ke saamne shart rakhi ki yadi farhaad pahaadon ke bich chattaanon main nahar khod de to vah shirin kaa vivaah usase kar denge
 This was an extremely difficult task, but Farhad began digging the canal
 uski athak mehnat dekhakar raja ko laga ki kahin farhaad apana lakshya praapt na kar le
 The canal was nearing completion, the bewildered king sought to consult his courtiers for the daughter's marriage
 unke vajeer ne salaah di ki kisi boodhi stri ko farhaad ke paas bhejein or yah sandesh den ki rajkumaari kii maut ho chuki he
 Then an old woman came to Farhad and started crying loudly
 farhaad ne usase rone kaa kaaran poocha to budhiya ne kaha, tum jiske liye apane sharir ko khata rahe ho-vah to mar chuki he
 Hearing this, Farhad got shocked and killed himself with his tools, the canal had been built, but instead of water, Farhad's blood was flowing in it
 farhaad kii maut kii khabar sunakar shirin ne bhi khud ko khatm kar liya
 Thus another love story fell asleep in the lap of untimely death
