 And when England host an international Test match, they use the "duke cricket ball", while Kookaburra balls are used for all other Test matches

 Homeopathy is a medical practice
 homeopathy chikitsa vigyaan ke janmdata dow chrishchiyan friderick samul hanemaan he
 It is based on the 'principle of symmetry' of medicine according to which medicines can cure diseases similar to those they can cause
 aushadhi kii rogahar shakti jisase utpann ho sakane vaale lakshanon par nirbhar he
 Those who like the symptoms of the disease but should prevail
 at: rog atyant nishchaypurvak, jad se, avilamb or sadaa ke liye nasht or samaapt usee aushadhi se ho saktaa he jo maanav sharir main, rog ke lakshanon se prabal or lakshanon se atyant milte julate sabhi lakshan utpann kar sake
 In the homeopathy method, the main task of the doctor is to listen to the life-history and symptoms mentioned by the patient and choose the medicine that produces the same symptoms
 rog lakshan evam aushadhi lakshan main jitani hi adhik samanta hogi rogi ke swasth hone kii sambhaavna bhi utani hi adhik rahati he
 The physician's experience is his greatest assistant
 puraane or kathin rog kii chikitsa ke liye rogi or chikitsak donon ke liye dhairya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Some homeopathy medical system proponents believe that the cause of the disease is the increase of atrophy in the body
 homeopathy chikitsakon kii dharna he ki prayek jivit praani hamen indriyon ke kriyasheel adarsh ko banaae rakhane kii pravriti hoti he aure jab yah kriyasheel adarsh vikrut hota he, tab praani main is adarsh ko praapt karne ke liye anek pratikriyaayein hoti hai
 The creature is only assisted in its efforts by medicine
 aushadhi alp maatra main deni chahie, kyonki beemaari main rogi atisanvegi hota he
 a small amount of the drug is effective, so that only one effect appears and there are no side effects
 rugnavastha main utakon kii roopantarit sangraahakta ke kaaran yah ekavastha prabhaav swasthya ke pun: sthaapan main viniyamit ho jaataa he
 Scholars consider homeopathy as pseudoscience
 da haniman dwaara pravartit homeopathy kaa mul siddhant he - "similia simivibas curenter" arthath rog unheen aushadhiyon se niraapad rup se, shighratisheeghra or atyant prabhaavshaalee rup se nirog hote hai, jo rogi ke rogalakshanon se milte-julate lakshan utpann karne main sakasham hai
 In other words, according to this rule, the small amount of the same drug, which creates a disorder in a healthy body, also destroys the natural symptoms of such symptoms
 udhaaharan ke liye kachche pyaaj kaatane par zukam ke jo lakshan ubharate hai jaise naak, aankh se pani nikalnaa usee prakaar ke zukam ke sthiti main homeopathic aushadhi alium sipa dene se thik bhi ho jaataa he
 In homeopathy, patients are instructed to give only one medicine at a time
 hanemaan ne anubhav ke aadhaar par ek baar main keval ek aushadhi kaa vidhaan nishchit kiya tha, kintu ab is mat main bhi paryaapt parivartan ho gaya he
 Some of the modern practitioners are following the path suggested by Hanaman and some have decided their own path and use two, three medicines at a time
 sadrush vigyaan ke aadhaar par rogi kii chayan kii gai aushadhi kii maatra ati nayun honi chaiye taaki dawa ke dushprinaam na dikhen
 Firstly, it acts as a component in the success of the body's resistance
 homeopathic aushadhi ko vishesh rup se taiyaar kiya jaataa he jise aushadhi shaktikaran kaa naam diya jaataa he
 These substances are prepared from trituration and liquids with suction system
 yah ek mul prasang he
 It is also true that homeopathy does not cure in the name of diseases
 vastav main yah rog se grasit vyakti ke maansik, bhavatmak tathaa shaareerik aadi sabhi pahaluhein kii chikitsa karti he
 Homeopathy of five asthma patients cannot be treated with a single medicine
 sampurna lakshan ke aadhaar par yah paanch rogiyon main alag-2 aushadhiyaan nirdhaarit kii ja sakati hai
 Hahnemann recognized the biographical power in the human body, and proclaimed that this biographical power protects the body from external invasive diseases
 parantu rogki avasthaa main yah jeevani shakti rog grasit ho jaati he
 The medicine selected on the basis of similar science, destroys this biotic power disorder and frees the body from disease
 haniman ne paaya ki sabhi puraane rogon ke aadharbhoot kaaran sora, psychosis or siphilis hai
 Hahnemann gave them the word Miyaz which means Greek - to pollute
 aushadhi ko chikitsa hetu upyog karne ke liye unki therapuyitak kshamta kaa gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Drug certification is a process in homeopathy in which the basic characteristics of the medicine are used to know the medicine by using it in healthy humans
 in aushadhiyon kaa pramann swasth manushyon par kiya jaataa he or inase hone vaale lakshanein kii jaankaree ke aadhaar par sadrushta vigyaan kii madad se rogon kaa ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 The important aspect of this medical practice is the potency
 prarambh main hanemaan ucch samarthy kii aushadhi prayukt karte the, kintu anubhav se inhone nimnasamarthy kii aushadhi kaa prayog bhi prabhavakaari paaya
 They found that many times, where physical changes or external factors are present in the disease, the drug of low strength works better
 homeopathic aushadhiyon main teen prakaar ke scale prayog kiye jate hai - In this, the process of triturate or succussion is done by mixing one part of the medicine in nine parts of the vehicle
 inase banane vaali aushadhi kii scale ko "x" shabd se janaa jaataa he jaise kaali faas 6x, aconite 3x ityadi
 Mostly, this scale used in solid drugs takes one part of medicine and 9 parts of milk-sugar to make 1x, liquid medicines use one part root and 9 parts alcohol to make 1x
 isse aage 2x ke liye 1x kaa ek bhaag or 9 bhaag dugdh sharkara athwa alcohol kaa lete hai ; aise hi aage kai potency banane ke liye pichhali potency kaa ek bhaag lete huye aage kii power ko badhaate hai
 In this, one part of the medicine is sacrificed with 99 parts of the vehicle
 inaki inase banane vaali aushadhiyon ko dawa kii shakti "c" se janaa jaataa he
 Such as 30c, 200c, 1000c etc
 sakkashan sirf dawa ke mul arq ko alcohol main milaanaa bhar nahin he balki use sakkashan karnaa he
 Nowadays automatic machine is used for succession, whereas in olden times it was to be made by hand by itself
 pehali potency banane ke liye dawa ke mul arq kaa ek hissaa or 99 bhaag alcohol liya jaataa he, isko 10 baar sacshan kar ke pehali potency taiyaar hoti he ; isi tarah duusari potency ke liye pichhali potency kaa ek bhaag or 99 bhaag alcohol ; isi tarah aage kii potency taiyaar kii jaati hai
 One of the main reasons for opposition to homeopathy is the low quantity of homeopathic medicines
 homeopathy davaayen arq, sampeshan tathaa tanutaaon ke rup main hoti he or kuch ether yaa glisreen main dhuli hoti hai, jaise sarpavish
 The extracts are mainly derived from the animal and vegetable world
 inhen vishisht ras, mul arq yaa matics tinchar kehete hai or inkaa pratik greek akshar 'theta' he
 The methods for preparing different strengths from matrix tinctures and transmissions are the same
 tanutaaon main bhinn-bhinn samarthy kii aushadhiyaan taiyaar kii jaati hai
 After starting from Moolark, as we grow in the scale of Tanuta, as we move away from the raw material, this is why the medicines made by the homeopathy method are generally toxic and harmless
 in aushadhiyon main ascharyajanak prabhaavshaalee aushadhiy gun hota he
 They are strong in disease and inactive towards body formation
 gandhak, paara, sankhiya, jasta, tin, barita, sona, chaandi, loha, chuunaa, tanba, tathaa telurium ityadi tatwon tathaa anya bahut se padaarthon se aushadhiyaan banaai gai hai
 Drugs are also made from the compounds of the elements
 homeopathy aushadhvivarani main 260 se 270 tak aushadhiyon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Most of these have been tested on healthy males, females or children to determine their pathogenic properties

 He died of brain trauma in 1924
 woodro wilson ne swapn main bhi yah nahin sochaa hoga ki ek din vah sanyukt rajya america kaa raashtrapati banegaa

 lekin raashtrapati banane ke pashchaat kisi ne itani dridhtaa, sooyeeboojh, raashtra-nirmaan kii dakshata evam karttavya-parayanata se kaary nahin kiya hoga, jitna shaanti ke maseehaa wilson ne
 Despite being a visionary and an idealist, he was the best, more realistic and accomplished political leader after Lincoln
 parantu 1913 main koi bhi yah nahin jaanata tha ki wilson mahaan vyakti banegaa
 No one knew that in spite of all efforts by Wilson for the United States not to participate in the First World War, that nation would have to take a decisive part in the war
 koi nahi jaanata tha ki vah atlantic ke us paar jaakar vishwa ko sthaayee shaanti dene kaa prayaas karegaa or uske praytn kuch europea raajnneetigyon kii swaarthparayanata or gharelu tuchh virodhon kii vedi par nasht honge
 No American president would have seen his own ideals and plans being mercilessly overthrown and defeated by his own people
 wilson raajnneeti shaastra kaa praadhyaapak tha
 Therefore, he was a thinker
 usne america prashasan par vishad granth likhe the
 His idea was that the sharing of power between the executive and the administration could not reconcile the governance
 atev uski ichha thi ki america raashtrapati ko england ke pradhanmantri kii bhaanti shaktishaalee hona chaiye
 When he became President, he undoubtedly implemented his ideas and made it a powerful focal point of President's rule
 usamen saahasik nirbhikta, niruttar kar dene vaali nishkapatata thi
 He believed that satvik works will always triumph and that the representatives of truth should not compromise with untruths, indiscretions and hypocrisy
 apane shasankaal ke aarmabhik varshon main hi usne sampoorn janata kaa dhyaan aakarshith kar liya
 He inspired a sense of dedication, sacrifice and morality throughout national life
 lekin swayan kii satviktaa evam uddeshyon ke prati usamen itnaa garv kar gaya ki vah sochane laga ki jo uskaa virodh karte the ve ishwar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 He lacked Lincoln's humility
 apane chunaav abhiyaan main usne purv ke anudaaravaadi vichaaron ko tyagkar pragativaad kaa naaraa diya tha
 After becoming president, he did not take a compromising life in his personality, although he also praised Brian for his presidential nomination, with the impression that he should 'throw her in the trash'

 He was well-versed in the art of pleasant taste and humble bribery, but at the same time he was also of deep morality, kindness and sensitive instinct

 It included elements of the 'former plane', the 'philosopher king' of Plato and the 'prince' of Machiavelli

 Wilson believed in the diplomacy of peace, favoring the resolution of differences by diplomacy of negotiations
 vah adarshavaadi tha
 When he was elected President for the second time, he was deeply concerned that in view of the tense world situation, America could not be placed on the foot of neutrality
 wilson shaanti kaa samarthak tha
 He was well aware that the war of war would have a huge impact on the ideology, philosophy and literature of the Americans from the American state in the world war
 wilson ne america prastaavon ko shaanti ke liye prastut kiya jinhen europea shaktiyon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The US declared neutrality
 4 sitambar 1914 ko congress ke naam apane rajanyik sandensh main wilson ne kaha ki-”yah sthiti hamaare dwaara nirmit nahin he lekin yah hamaare saamne he
 It directly affects us as if we are partakers of the circumstances that gave rise to it
 ham iskaa bhugtan karenge yadhyapi hamane jaanboojhkar ise janm nahin diya he
 "america could not remain untouched by the Great War, yet in 1914 no American knew that they would have to engage in war
 jab germany kii you-boton ne aniyantrit yuddh shuru kar diya to germany ke viruddh antim shaktishaalee tatasth desh america bhi yuddh main pravisht ho gaya
 Wilson sent his famous message to the Congress on 2 April 1917, in which he advised his country to enter the war and protect the world democratic powers
 ukt sandesh main usne kaha, ”jin siddhanton ko ham hriday se chaahate hai, unki raksharth ham avashya ladege
 We will protect democracy
 ham un logon ke adhikaron kii raksha karenge jo kisi nyaaypurna satta kaa aadar karte hai or is prakaar anushaasan main rahakar apane shashan main kuch adhikaar chaahate hai
 We will protect the rights and freedoms of all small countries and nations
 ham avashya chahenge ki saare sansar main swatantra logon ko nyaaypurna swatantrata praapt rahe jisase sabhi deshon main shaanti or suraksha bani rahe or is prakaar sara vishwa swatantra rahe
 Today is the fortunate day of America, when our citizens will spend their blood and their power to protect the principles on which America was born, on the basis of which America got happiness and prosperity and that priceless peace
 Which he has been observing in terms of great importance
 “ Peaceful Wilson was constrained
 america ke bhavishya ke liye yah atyant mahatv kii baat thi ki use aisa vyakti raashtrapati ke rup main mila tha jisane is yuddh ke aadhaar ko ‘moksh or sudhaar kii sangya’ main parinat kar diya
 a part of the speech of 17 January 1917 expresses his sensitive thoughts towards the whole of humanity - "peace without victory of any party, principle of self-judgment for each caste, collective, freedom, limitation of arms and weapons, engaging System of collective protection for eradication of treaties and to prevent invasion
 “ 2 april ko wilson ne desh kii sarvocch pratinidhi sanstha congress ke saamne upasthit hokar yuddh kii ghoshnaa karne kii anumati maangi
 "let this great peaceful people go towards war - the most terrible and destructive war
" 
le janaa bhayanak baat he
 Civilization itself is swinging in the pan of crisis, but justice is more valuable than peace and we will fight for such things which have been dear to us

 You can dedicate your life and your everything to such folk work
 is abhiyaan ke saath ki vah din aa gaya he, jab america kaa aparaa rakt or shakti, apane siddhanton ke liye jinhone use janm or sukh-shaanti di he, jise usne surakshit rakhaa he, kharch kerani chahie yani ishwar kii krupa rahi to vah iske atirikt or kuch kar bhi nahin saktaa

 The words emanating from his heart were so poignant that the whole nation jumped on his voice in the war for the victory of civilization over the barbarism of democracy over dictatorship

 In the words of Nevins and Koumager - "power as much as power, power without any hindrance or limitation" was promised by President Wilson and succeeded in imposing nation fanatics
 is vachan kii purti ke liye avilamb karyrat ho gaya
 No government before it had shown more intelligence and efficiency in war
 iske purv americavsiyon ne bhi aisi sphurti, saadhan-sampannataa or avishkaar buddhi kaa prabhaavshaalee pradarshan nahin kiya tha
 "peace without victory" had become the slogan of war
 yuddh-viraam sandhi ke pashchaat wilson jab apane sachiv kii salaah na maanakar disambar, 1918 main paris shaanti sammelan main pahunchaa to uskaa ‘shaanti ke maseehaa’ ke rup main swaagat hua
 At that time in Europe, there was a feeling that Wilson is the only person who has risen above the rage and hatred of various nations and is the protector of humanity
 atah jab yah darshanik raja apane siddhanton kii pustika haath main lekar sainik-shakti se las, sandhi kii sharten nirdhaarit karne aayaa to europe kii janata ne uske sammaan main hriday khol diya
 It received unprecedented reception in all countries
 jab vah paris pahunchaa to francisi use dekhakar anand-vibhor ho uthe
 He was praised by a large crowd on the streets and the newspapers praised him
 vastav main sabhi kii ankhen uski ore lagi thim
 The victors hoped for justice, victories of mercy and common manpower
 wilson is sammelan main shaanti kaa deep banakar aayaa tha
 He did not want the Paris Conference to become a stronghold of vested interests like the Vienna Congress of 1815
 parantu vah andaaj nahin laga paaya tha ki vijeta rashtron main swaarth kii gandh rahati he or yadi vah anya tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhata to vah us jaal yaa dhokhe se batch jaataa jisamen vah swayan apane adarshavaad ke kaaran buree tarah ulajh gaya
 His sacred objectives were consumed in front of the conquering nations
 wilson ne apane vichaaron ko prasiddh 14 sutron ke rup main prastut kiya
 The first of its 14 sources was that peace agreements would be made publicly, there would be no secret agreement
 in siddhanton kii mitrarashtron ke raajnneetigyon ne bhi saraahna kii thi
 Apart from the above principles, what else did they have to solve post-war problems? And the defeated nations also agreed to these principles but nothing could be done in front of the ideals and principles in the power-loving nations
 is sammelan main bhi rashtravaadi vichaaron, vyaktigat swaarthon kaa bolbalaa rahaa, jinka vienna congress main praadhanya rahaa tha
 Both Clemensi of France and Lloyd of England succeeded in imposing their dogma on Wilson
 aar0bi0 mobaat ne ‘european diplomasi’ main likhaa he ki ”klemenso praatavkaal yah vaakya duharaaya karata tha- main rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa samarthan karuunga
 "but when Orlando of Italy was asked what is your opinion about the League of Nations, he replied that" We would undoubtedly welcome the establishment of the League of Nations, but the question of Fume should be fixed
 “ wilson sampoorn sammelan main akelaa pad gaya tha
 After the Vienna Congress, there was no such global conference in Europe on such a large scale
 princeton main raajnneeti-darshan kaa yah bhootpurv professor ek pratibhashali vaktaa tathaa adarshavaadi vichaarak tha
 He was a man of strong beliefs with a high degree of political foresight, but not so much diplomatic competence as to prepare other representatives for lenient dealings with defeated nations
 stennard baker ke shabdon main ”jis kisi ne bhi usko kaam karte dekha, uski kabhi himmat nahin hui ki vah wilson ke samaksh athwa uski peeth peeche ninda karne kaa saahas karata
 "wilson believed that mankind could be protected only by the establishment of the League of Nations, so he wanted to make it an indispensable part of all peace
 kintu vah maansik drushti se loyad jorge tathaa klemenso ke samaan kushagra nahin tha or apane purv-nirdhaarit vichaaron par vishesh rup se bharosa rakhata tha, atah vah kootneeti ke kshetra main or raajnneetik saudebaaji ke nausikhia siddh hua
 Other countries took full advantage of his idealism and excessive enthusiasm to establish a League of Nations
 anya desh rashtrasang ke nirmaan kii baat maan len, iske liye wilson sab kuch tyaagane ke liye taiyaar tha, yahaan tak ki rashtrasang ke liye vah apane 14 sutron ke anek siddhanton kii avhelnaa karne ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gaya
 According to Paul Birdsall's statement, he was successful in getting most of his sayings in the name of the League from Britain, France and Japan on all other questions besides the problem of compensation
 chini janata dwaara baas hua shantung kaa pradesh wilson ke aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth ke aadhaar par china ko milanaa chaiye tha, kintu wilson ne rashtrasang kii sthapana ke liye anya mahashaktiyon kaa sahyog praapt karne kii ichha se ise japan ko dene kaa nirnay kiya
 This decision was a rebuff by Wilson himself
 phir bhi, paris-sammelan main yadi parajiton ke saath thodi narmi barti gai to vah wilson ke kaaran hi
 There was no doubt that if Wilson had not been in the conference, Lloyd George and Clemenso would have known what to do
 wilson hi unki aseem aakankshaon par ankush lagaataa rahaa
 If Wilson had not been there, France would have died by erasing Germany's nomination
 wilson ke do uddeshy the
 First just agreement according to which the boundaries of nations are determined on the principle of self-decision so that mutual peace can be established
 dwitiya, rashtrasang kii sthapana
 In the first objective, he did not succeed because the peace that was done was imposing peace and not on the basis of self-judgment or peace of negotiation
 parantu use duusare uddeshy main safalataa praapt hui
 The idea of a League of Nations was not original and many people contributed to clarify this idea in many countries, but the League of Nations that was finally founded was Wilson's creation and the temple of his ideals
 kuch vidwaanon kaa vichaar he ki wilson ne swayan paris main aakar ek baari bhul kii
 If he had stayed in Washington and ordered the American delegates, it would have been more likely that his influence would have been more widespread, but Wilson was most concerned with the League of Nations and his desire was to make the legislation of the world institution his own
 vastav main yah bahut durbhagyapurna rahaa ki jahaan sammelan main uski upasthiti swayan sammelan ke liye hitkar na rahi, vahaan apane desh se dur hokar vah america janata se bhi sampark sthapit na rakh sakaa jiskaa dushprinaam yah hua ki uske dwaara poshit rashtrasang ko uske swayan ke desh ne hi asweekaar kar diya
 The US Senate did not accept Wilson's offer of membership of the League of Nations
 1918 main congress ke chunaavon main wilson virdohi republican dal ko congress ke donon sadanon main bahumat praapt ho gaya or seenet ne rashtrasang ke vidhaan evam varsay kii sandhi ko sweekaar karne ke masavide ko radd kar diya
 It was a sad defeat of a great prophet of humanity
 woodro wilson kaa maananaa tha ki lok prashasan ko raajnneeti se pruthak hona chahie
 He is generally remembered for underlining divisions in administration and politics
 wilson ke anusaar kisi samvidhan kii rachana to aasaan he kintu usko kriyanvit karnaa kathin he
 He laid special emphasis on the study of the field of implementation
 apane nibandh study of administration main wilson ne raajnneeti or prashasan ke antarasambandhon par charchaa karte hue likhaa tha ki, prashasan raajnneeti ke vishay kshetra ke baahar he
 Administrative problems are not political problems
 yadhyapi raajnneeti, prashasan ke kaary va swaroop nirdhaarit kar sakati he phir bhi usko yah adhikaar nahin diya janaa chahie ki vah prashasnic pakshon ke bare main her-pher kar sake
 Woodrow Wilson was instrumental in establishing the administration as a subject, making the administration independent of politics

 The constitutions of other countries are fully in writing but the UK has no original constitutional document
 isaliye praayah kaha jaataa he ki euke kaa samvidhan alikhit, akodit he
 But the word 'unwritten' is often misleading because most of the British constitution is written in various forms
 @sureshpatelsa Features of British Constitution: british samvidhan ko ”samvidhanon kii janani” kaha jaataa he kyonki sabase puraane is samvidhan ne baad ke sabhi samvidhanon ke liye maardarshak kaa kaam kiya 
 The first democratic governance system of modern world came into existence in Britain, the monarchy
 kulinavaad se prerit rahe britain main rajtantr ke rahete hue bhi prajatantric sansthaaon or pratinidhik shashan kaa vikaas hua or alikhit british samvidhan par rajtantr, kulinatantr or janatantr teenon kaa asar aayaa 
 The characteristics of the British Constitution can only be understood in these contexts as follows: 1
 alikhit samvidhan: Where the constitution of various progressive countries of the world is written, the British constitution is unwritten
 yahi nahin vahaan sarkari kaam kaaj ke niyam aadi kaa bhi adhikansh bhaag alikhit he 
 In fact, the development of the British constitution progressively coincided with the development of other institutions and was never written down because they did not feel its need
 iske peeche mukhya kaaran unki vyavhaarik or spasht soch he 
 The symbol of the rule of law is that Britons are maintaining this symbol without a written constitution, it is a unique feature
 lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki likhit nyaayik nirnyon, sansadeey adhiniyamon or shasnadeshon ke rup main samvidhan kaa anshatah lekhikaran bhi ho gaya he 
 This has not been done for the purpose of giving written form to the Constitution
 yahi kaaran he ki british samvidhan ek alikhit dastavej hi he 
 2
 Traditionally gradual development: british samvidhan koi ek din yaa ek varsh main ek sthaan par baithkar nahin banaaya gaya 
 It has developed and is continuously developing from the fifth century to the present day
 is samvidhan ke adhikansh aadharbhoot siddhant yaa tark paramparaon par aadhaarit hai 
 JS Mill has called these traditions "the unwritten proverbs of the constitution"
 yadhyapi ye paramparaayen nyaayalay dwaara pravartaneey nahin he tathaapi vahaan kii shashan pranali main maanviya or paalniy he 
 Their importance lies in the fact that the British Raj system cannot be imagined without them
 jaise: Taj to work in consultation with the Cabinet
 jan pratinidhi sadan ke bahumatadhari dal ke netaa ko taj dwaara pradhanmatri niyukt karnaa 
 The collective and individual responsibility of the Cabinet towards the House of Representatives
 sansadeey adhiniyamon ko taj dwaara sweekruti

 Emery states that "the British constitution is a mixture of law, precedence and tradition
" ” 3
 Difference in theory and practice: britain main samvidhan ke alikhit siddhant prachlit hai lekin vyavhaar main kuch bhinnataayen najar aati hai 
 like: britain vidhi ke shashan ko antim maanata he lekin vahaan prashasnic vidhi kaa prachlan nirantar bad rahaa he 
 There is a parliamentary democracy in principle, but the crown is a hereditary, not a mere elected executive
 munro ke anusaar- ”british samvidhan kii ek adbhut visheshta yah he ki yah jaisaa dikhataa he vaisaa he nahin or jaisaa he, vaisaa dikhataa nahin 
 " 4
 sansadeey prajatantr: The parliamentary form of democracy is the creation of Britain
 british sansadeey vyavastha main: There is a dual executive - a nominal executive as the Taj and a real executive as the Council of Ministers
 taj rajya kaa pramukh he jabaki mantriparishad sarkaar kii pramukh he 
 Here the government emerges from the legislature i
e
 the Council of Ministers and the legislature have homogeneous relations
 janpratinidhi sadan main bahumat praapt dal sarkaar banaata he 
 And the government is responsible to this house
 yah uttardaayitv mantriparishad kaa samuhik or mantriyon kaa vyactik donon prakaar kaa hota he 
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the Taj can dissolve the lower house
 britain main vishisht kism kaa ganatantr he 
 Because a legitimate monarchy exists in this democratic country
 taj kaa chunaav nahin hota or vah vanshanugat pad he 
 The person on whose head the crown is placed becomes the king
 jaan aag isaliye is ”mukutadhaari” ganatantr kehete hai 
 5
 Parliamentary Supremacy: british rajvyavastha kaa aadhaar he- sansadeey sarvocchata kaa siddhant 
 This means: sansad ko koi bhi kanoon banane, sanshodhit karne yaa nirast karne kaa antim adhikaar he 
 De Lolme says- "the British Parliament can do anything except change a woman from man to man
" ” The British Parliament makes general or specific or constitutional law by the same general procedure
 british kanoonon ko nyaayalay main chunauti nahin di ja sakati he 
 The Taj has to sign parliamentary laws
 bejahot likhte hai- ”yadi sansad ke donon sadan uske mrityu-aadesh ko paarit kar uske paas preshit karen to hamen us par bhi hastakshar karne hi padenge 
 " 6
 vidhi kaa saaman: Britain is world famous for the rule of law because the rule of law started not only from here but in its best sense it is applicable in Britain itself
 vidhi ke shashan kaa arth he – saamaanya kanoon kii sarvocchata 
 In "the Law of Constitutions", Dicey states three meanings of the rule of law: saamaanya kanoon kii sarvocchata: Common law is supreme in the country, which does not have the influence of any arbitrary power
 prayek vyakti keval kanoon dwaara hi shasit he 
 equality before the law: kanoon ke samaksh sab vyakti ek samaan hai chaahe unki saamaajik, aarthik, rajnatik haisiyat kuch bhi ho 
 There is only one law for everyone
 swayan samvidhan kanoon kii dein he: In England, the source of civil rights is common law, which is enforced by judicial decisions
 vahaan vidhaan swayan hi in nirnyon-kanoonon ke parinamswaroop viksit hua he 
 7
 Finesse: britain kaa samvidhan prakruti main lachila he or use aasaani se sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he 
 There is no difference between common law and constitutional law, that is, amendments are made through the same general parliamentary process by which common laws are made
 8
 ekaatmak samvidhan: The British Constitution is a single constitution
 yah na sirf sampurna great britain ke liye ek he, apitu yah ikhari naagarikta, ek hi kanoon aadi ko sunishchit karata he 
 9
 Civil Rights: britain kaa samvidhan nagarikon ko anek adhikaar pradaan karata he jaise daihik swatantraaa, sabha-sammelan kii swatantraaa, shastrdharan karne kii swatantraaa, vichaar abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ityadi 
 10
 Unitary State: britain kaa samvidhan sampurna britain ko sangh ke sthaan par ”ekaatmak rajya” ghoshit karata he 
 In this, the entire power is considered to be vested in the central government and it can form and disband regional units, local government etc
 for its governance convenience

 dwi-daleey raajnneetik vyavastha: Britain has adopted a two-party system in place of multi-party, adopting parliamentary democracy

 a positive electron is a fundamental particle found in an atom
 yah dhan aavesh yukt electron he
 Its properties are similar to electrons, but the difference between the two is that electron is negatively charged particle and positron is positive charged particle
 iskaa dravyaman electron ke dravyaman ke samaan hota he
 It was discovered in 1932 by Carl D
 Anderson
 iskaa vidyut aavesh +1
602176487×10−19 kulamb hota he
 Its rotation speed is half
 positron ko β+ chinh se bhi darshaate he
 When the positron and electron collide, both are destroyed and two gamma ray photons are generated
 chikitsaalay main upyog hone vaale eks kiran main neutron, gamma kiran, protone, nutrino, ke saath positron bhi shaamil rahata he
 Positron's experimental invention occurred in 1932 AD
 andersan ne dekha ki wilson abhrakoshth main chumbakeey kshetra lagaakar yadi antariksh kirnon ke photo len, to praaia: electron jaise do path drushti main aate hai, jinaki vakrata ulti dishaao main hoti he
 The curvature depends on the charge of the particle
 isaliye in prayogon se spasht he ki in kanon kaa aavesh ulta hoga
 Now the existence of positron has also been established by other tests
 pozitron ke prayogtmak avishkaar se chaar varsh pehle dirack ne ek sameekaran diya tha, jisase electron ke sab gyaat gundharmon kaa varnan ho jaataa tha, kintu saath hi iske anusaar ek aise kan kaa maananaa bhi anivaary tha jisaki sanhati or urja rinatmak hon
 This thing was strange
 is avaanchhneeya sthiti se bachane ke liye dirack ne prastaav rakhaa ki saadharantaya rinatmak urja kii sab avasthaaen electronon se bhari rahati hai
 Therefore, we can see only the states of positive energy
 par kabhi kabhi jab vidyutchchumbakeey kshetra dwaara prabal, paraspar kriyaayein hoti hai tab rinatmak urja kii avasthaaon main se ek electron baahar nikal aata he tathaa baahar aakar aise vyavhaar karata he jaise dhan urja electron karte hai
 But at the same time a state with negative energy becomes empty
 ise ham rin urja ke samudr main ek chhidr se chitrit kar sakate hai
 This hole behaves in the same way as a positively charged particle, which is equivalent to an electron
 pahile dirack ne is kan ko proton maanane kaa praytn kiya, par andersan ke parinaam kaa pataa chalane par unhone is kan ko proton nahin, parantu pozitron mana
 Dirac's perforation theory is not very satisfactory
 electron or pozitron kaa aadhunik siddhant dirack sameekaran ke dwitiya quanteekaran par nirbhar he
 The properties of positron are derived from the natural method
 electron or pozitron ko 'kan' or 'pratikan' kah sakate hai
 This ideology has proved extremely useful in physics

 It also has a tendency to evolve like Awadhi - Khet> Khetu, Marat> Mattu
 kahin-kahin ‘kha’ ke sthaan par ‘k’ uccharit hota he- bheekh > bhik, ‘na’ ‘d’ ho jaataa he- ravan > ravad, gana > gad
