 rugveda main aaryon kaa nivasasthal "saptsindhu" pradesh ke naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 The riverside of the Rigveda has an aggregated description of the rivers flowing in the Aryanivas, the main ones being - Kubha, Krugu, Gomti, Indus, Parushni, Shutudri, Vitta, Saraswati, Yamuna and Ganga
 yah varnan vaidic aaryon ke nivasasthal kii seemaa kaa nirdeshak mana ja saktaa he
 In the Brahmin texts, the Kuru Panchal country is considered to be the center of Aryan culture where this land was called "prajapati's navel" by the legislation of many yagyagas
 shatapath brahman kaa kathan he ki kuru paanchal kii bhashaa hi sarvottam tathaa pramanik he
 In the Upanishads period, the progress of Aryasabhaya spread to Kashi and Videha districts
 falat: punjab se mithila tak kaa vistrut bhubhag aaryon kaa pavitra nivas upanishdon main mana gaya
 The extent of Aryavarta in the Dharmasutras differed greatly in the subject
 vashishthadharmasutra main aryaavart kii yah prakhyat seemaa nirdhaarit kii gai he ki yah adarsh ke purv, kaalak van ke pashchim, paariatr tathaa vindhyas ke uttar or himalay ke dakshin main he
 The other two opinions are also mentioned here that Aryavarta is the terrain between the Ganges and the Yamuna and the Krishna deer performs uninterrupted transmission in it
 boudhayan, patanjali tathaa manu ne bhi vasishthokt mat ko hi pramanik mana he
 In Manu's vision, Aryavarta is very similar to Madhya Pradesh and has a small, but holiest terrain called "brahmavart" within it, which is confined by the rivers Saraswati and Drishdwati, and the traditional ethos is considered ethic
 aryaavart kii yahi pramanik seemaa thi or iske baahar ke desh mlechh desh maane jate the, jahaan tirthayatra ke atirikt jane par ishti yaa sanskaar karnaa aavashyak hota tha
 The countries of Avanti, Anga, Magadha, Surashtra, Dakshinapatha, Upavritta, indus-sauvir etc
 have been counted in the Mudcha countries in the Boudhayan Dharmasutra
 parantu aaryon kii samskruti or sabhyataa brahmanon ke dharmik utsaah ke kaaran anya deshon main bhi faili jinhen aryaavart kaa ansh kaa na maananaa satya kaa aplaap hoga
 Medhatithi's opinion on this subject seems very rational
 unka kahana he ki ""jis desh main sadaachari kshatriya raja mlecchon ko jitkar chaaturvarnya kii pratishtha kare or mlecchon ko aryaavart ke chandalon ke samaan vyavasthit kare, vah desh bhi yajna ke liye uchit sthaan he, kyonki prithvi swat: apavitra nahin hoti, balki apavitron ke sansarg se hi dooshit hoti he"" 
 Such conquered Mlechcha countries are also biased to consider Medhatithi Aryavarta
 samskruti kii pragati kii yah maang thukraai nahin ja sakati
 That is why Mahabharata Punjab, which was once the center of Vedic period of Aryan culture, is not worth staying for even two days, because in the era of purity due to the influence of the Yavan, it had become extremely ethics in that era
 aryaavart hi guptkaal main 'kumari dweep' ke naam se prasiddh tha
 In the Puranas, Aryavarta is specifically referred to as "bharatavarsha"

 In 1471, the kingdom of Mosca maha-duke captured it but the Russians continued to come here
 in nae roosiyon ne sthaneey sami va pomor logon ko apane adheen mehnat-mazaduri karne par majaboor kar diya
 By the 16th century, there was a tussle between the Russian Tsar-state and the denmark-norway monarchy over the Kola Peninsula, which further strengthened the Russians' presence here
 purv se komi log or nenets log bhi yahan aakar basane lage kyonki unki mathrubhumiyon main unke rangifer jhundon main mahamari failane lagi thi
 Under pressure from Russian, Komi, and Nenets, the Sami people began to move north

 Only one book was published in his life - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 baad kii prakashit pustakon main Philosophical Investigations kaaphi charchit rahi
 Wittgenstein has been a professor at the University of Cambridge
 vitgenshtin ke pita karl ek yahudee the jinhone baad main protestant dharm apana liya tha
 Wittgenstein's greatest contribution is to put language in a philosophical perspective
 aaj koi bhi bhashaa vigyaan main jab darshan kaa ullekh karata he to vitganstin kaa naam swatah samaran hota he
 Wittgenstein's writings have resulted in considerable argumentation, even many times Wittgenstein's work has been called a paradox, but it would be wrong to say that logicians had emphasized logical analysis of language even before Wittgenstein
 vitganstin ke guru bartrand rasal rahe hai kaa tarkshastra ko darshan main uchit sthaan dilaane main baari yogadan he
 Wittgenstein's philosophical life is quite interesting because he has refuted his earlier works in his later works

 Wittgenstein's conclusion proved to be new and important to the philosophical world
 vitgenstin ne ek prakaar se is vichaar kaa pratipaadan kiya ki bhashaa se satya kaa vivaran nahin balki satya kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 All western philosophy is rooted in language, but language shows us only one form of truth, the truth which we create by our belief or experience
 vitgenstin baar baar ek bhashakreedaa kaa ullekh karte hai, jisamen bhaag lene vaale kisi satya kii abhivyakti ke liye bhashaa kaa nirmaan va upyog karte hai
 Through this play, we tell the difference in the facts and truths related to the Wittgenstein language
 apni nirnaatmak pustak "philosophical investigations" main wo kehete hai ki " adhiktar baar jab ham shabd ke "arth" kii baat karte hai, tab ham keval ek bhashaa main us shabd ke yojan kii baat karte hai "

 The word 'appeal' is originally in English, though it has many meanings, but in Hindi it is used in the context of 'application' which can be taken from someone below or from a lower judge or tribunal before a higher judge or tribunal
 The judge or tribunal is presented for reconsideration of the decision
 kisi hetu yaa vaad ke neeche ke nyaayadhish yaa nyaayaadhikaran se hataakar ucchtar nayaayadhish yaa nyaayadhish ke samaksh prastut karnaa chaar vibhijh pranaliyon dwaara hota he-- By appeal, punarikshan dwaara, By text, and nirdesh kii karrwai dwaara
 The decision of a judge or tribunal by review action may be reconsidered by the same judge or judge
 apil or punarikshan main antar yah he ki punarikshan ucchtar nyaayalay ke swavivek par sadaiv nirbhar rahata he or adhikaar yaa swatv ke rup main uski maang nahin kii ja sakati
 The High Court can appoint the revision on the basis that justice has been done in summary form by the court below, even if the decision has been contrary to law
 parantu apil aise kisi aadhaar par viyukt nahin kii ja sakati kyonki apil kaa, ek baar sweekaar ho jane par, nirnay vidhi ke anusaar kiya janaa tab tak anivaary he jab tak apil karneka adhikaar denevaali samavidhi main koi vipareet upbandh na ho
 The appeal differs from the Indian system of accounting in many ways
 lekh kii karrwai keval ucch nyaayalayon tathaa ucchtam nyaayalay main ho sakati he jab ki apil ucch nyaayalayon tathaa ucchtam nyaayalay ke atirikt anya nyaayalayon yaa nyaayaadhikaran main bhi ho sakati he
 The article is taken out under the superintendence power of the High Court to ensure that the court below, the tribunal, the rule or its officials do not act outside their jurisdiction or refuse to exercise the jurisdiction given for public purpose, or their decisions are direct Do not be adverse to the law of the country and they should perform their duties properly
 apil is prakaar seemaabaddh nahin he
 Appeal can be about all questions --- whether the question is of fact or of law
 dwitiya apil keval vidhi ke prashnon tak hi simit rahati he
 There is a distinction between appeals and directions that the instruction is sought by the lower court from the higher court so that any question of law or practice in respect of which the lower court has reasonable doubts, may be decided by the higher court
 angreji saamaanya vidhi main apil ke liye koi upbandh nahin tha
 But the mistakes of the common law courts could be rectified by the King's Bench court through error
 trutilekh keval vidhi ke prashn par hota tha, tathy ke prashn par nahin
 But Roman law provided for appeal
 englad main apil kii karrwai roman vidhi se lee gai or angreji vidhi main uskaa samavesh un vaadon main hua jinka nirnay suniti kshetradhikaar ke antargat lard chancelar dwaara athwa dharm yaa naukaadhikaran nyaayalayon dwaara hota tha
 Later, the statute regularized the right of appeal, both in common law and in other types of promises
 pracheen bharat main, jab vivaad kam hote the, raja swayan prajae ke vivaadon kaa nipataara karata tha
 There was no question of appeal at that time because the king was the source of justice
 parantu raja ke nyaayalay ke saath saath lokapriy nyaayalay hua karte the, baad main raja ne swayan neeche ke nyaayalayon kii sthapana kii
 An appeal against the popular court or the decision below could have been made before the king

 But after the failed independence war of 1857 AD, when the British state took over the rule of India from the East India Company, the Sadar civil court and the nizam-i-adalat were abolished and their jurisdiction was located in the metropolitan cities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras
 High Courts were given
 baad main bharat ke vibhinn praanton main ucch nyaayalayon kii sthapana hui
 There are generally two types of appeals --- first appeal or second
 katipay vaadon main tritiy apil bhi ho sakati he
 The first appeal lies in the higher court in relation to the adjudication of the initial court
 dwitiya apil--apil nyaayalay ke nirnay ke sambandh main shreshthatam adhikari ke samaksh hoti he
 In practice promises, all the orders of the court are divided into two parts - 'decree' and order '
 ajyapti se taatpary us abhinirnayan se he jiske dwaara, jahaan tak abhinirnayan denevaale nyaayalay kaa sambandh he, vaad yaa vaadanuroop anya aarambhik karrwai main nihit vivadagrast sab yaa kisi ek vishay ke sambandh main, vibhijh pakshon ke adhikaron kaa antim rup se nivaaran hota he vyavhaar-prakriya-samhita)
 The order implies the behavior of each such decision of the court, which does not fall in the category of decree, Code of behavior-procedure)
 aadesh ke viruddh keval ek apil ho sakati he
 The first appeal is against a decree under Section 96 of the Code of behavior-procedure before the High Court or District Judge at a later price
 pratham apil main tathy tathaa vidhi ke sabhi prashnon par vichaar ho saktaa he
 The First Appeal Court has all the powers of the trial court

 When the second appeal is heard by a judge of the High Court, the judge may allow another appeal before the 'letters Patent' or High Court Legislative Act, before a two-judge bench of the same court
 dand apil sambadhi vidhi dand--prakriya--samhita kii dhara 404 se lekar 431 tak main di hui he
 Punitive promises can only have one appeal

 The amount of work depends only on the initial and final stages of the body, not on how this work is done
 yadi praarambhik avasthaa main daab tathaa aaytan ke maan p0 tathaa V0 hai to kaary kii maatra antim avasthaa kii daab tathaa aaytan par nirbhar rahati he, arthath kaary kii maatra p tathaa v kaa ek falan he
 If the quantity of work is W, we can write w = u - U0 This equation is the definition of a zodiac U, which depends only on the state of that body and not on how that body has reached that state
 is raashi ko ham pind kii aantarik urja kehete hai
 If a body starts from a certain state and goes through different states and then comes to the same initial state, there will be no difference in its internal energy, ie f du = 0 And is a real difference
 yadi koi pind ek avasthaa se duusari avasthaa main jaae to kaa maan sarvada shunya ke baraabar nahin hoga
 This difference can be found if the value of u has been determined for each state
 yadi pind kii deevaaron kaa koi bhaag ushmagamya he to sarvada is antar ke baraabar ushma us pind ko deni padegi
 If the quantity of heat is q then q = u - U0 - w In this equation, q will be measured in the same units in which W, but if we have already determined the unit of Q, then we can find the ratio of these two units by this equation
 is prakaar jul ke prayog dwaara ham ushma kaa yantric tulyank nikaal sakate hai
 In this experiment, q equals zero and the value of is determined in heat units

 It is also characteristic of such a process that these processes are caused by phase 2 by reversing the signs of displacement, work done and absorbed heat
 These processes are called reversible processes
 jo prakram utkramntic nahin hote unhen anutkramntic prakram kehete hai
 It can be easily proved that if the pressure of a body is p then the work it will do in a reversible process is equal to pdv
 atev ushmagatiki ke pratham siddhant ko ham is tarah bhi likh sakate hai : dq = du + pdv roddan main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke anantpur jile kaa ek gaanv he

 saanchaa:infobox Election Voting age bhashavigyaan main, sanket prakriyaaon, yaa abhivyanjana or sampreshan, lakshan or pratik kaa adhyayan sanketavigyaan kehalaata he
 It is generally divided into the following three branches: sanketikta ko aksar mahatvapurn maanavshastreey ayaamon sahit dekha jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye, ambarto iko kaa prastaav he ki prayek saanskrithik ghatana kaa adhyayan sampreshan ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 However, some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of science
 ve prakritik vigyaan se sambandhit kshetron kii bhi jaanch karte hai-jaise ki kis prakaar jeev duniya main apane lakshanik karm sthiti ke bare main bhavishyakathan kar sakate hai or uske anukool ban sakate hai 
 saamanytah, lakshanik siddhant sanketon yaa sanket pranaaliyon ko apane adhyayan ke uddeshy ke rup main lete hai: jivit praaniyon main soochna kaa sampreshan jeev-lakshaniki yaa praani-lakshaniki main aavruth kiya jaataa he
 Syntax is the branch of semiotics that deals with the formal characteristics of signs and symbols
 darasal, vaakya-vigyaan "un niyamon se sambandhit he jo yah shasit kare ki kis prakaar vaakyansh or vaakya banane ke liye shabdon ko joda jaae
" charles morris kehete hai ki arthvigyaan sanketon kaa apane nirdesh or vastuon ke saath ve jo sambandh nirupit kar sakate hai yaa karte hai, ke sambandh se judaa he; or upyogetavaad lakshanikta ke jaiviny pahaluon ke saath sambandh rakhata he, arthath sanketon kii kriya main ghatit hone vaale sabhi manovaigyanik, jaivik yaa saamaajik ghatnaayen
 The term, written in English as semeiotics, was first used by Henry Stubbs in the definitive sense of denoting the branch of medical science related to the presentation of signs
 jon loke ne en esse cansarning human anderstanding ke pustak 4, adhyay 21 main semeiotike or semeiotics shabdon kaa prayog kiya
 In it, he explains how science can be divided into three parts: uske baad loke is teesri shrenee ke swabhaav ke bare main, use Σημειωτικη naam dete hue or nimna shabdon main "sanketon ke siddhant" ke rup main samajhaate hue vistrut karte hai: In the nineteenth century, Charles Sanders Pierce defined what he called a "semiotic" which is "the semi-essential, or formal principle of signs", the essence of which is "


 what must be the characters of all signs used by the intellect Are able to learn by experience "and which follows philosophical logic according to the signs and signs process
 charles morris ne "semiotic" shabd kaa upyog karne main piers kaa anusaran kiya or use maanav sampreshan se pashuon ke seekhney or sanketon ke upyog tak vistrut kiya
 However, Ferdinand de Laussure, looking at a very important area within symptomology, found it related to social science: lakshanshasthri sanketon or sanket pranaaliyon ko unke sanchaar tareeqe ke anusaar vargeekrut karte hai 
 sarthakata kii yah prakriya shabd banane ke liye maanvon dwaara prayukt kuta ke upyog par nirbhar karata he jo vyaktigat swar yaa akshar, apane angavinyas yaa bhaawanaaon se darshane ke liye shaareerik kriyaayein, yaa saamaanya rup se pahane jane vaale vastra ho sakate hai
 To create a word for reference to an object, the community must accept a common meaning in its language
 But that word will only be able to transmit the grammatical structure of the language and the meaning within the code
 The codes also represent the values of culture and are capable of adding new shades of meaning to every aspect of life
 lakshan-vigyaan or sampreshan adhyayan ke bich sambandh ko spasht karne ke liye, sampreshan ko strot se praptakarta ke bich data antaran kii prakriya ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Therefore, communication thinkers build models to elucidate the biology, psychology, and mechanics involved on the basis of code, medium, and context
 donon vishay yah bhi maanate hai ki takneekee prakriya ko is tathy se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki praptakarta ko data kaa kutanuwaad karnaa padataa he arthath data ko mukhya ke rup main pahachaanate hue uskaa arth nikaalane main sakasham rahanaa padataa he
 This means that there is essentially an interplay between semiotics and communication
 vastav main, kai avadharanaen saajha kii jaati hai, haalanki prayek kshetra main jor alag hota he
 Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics, Marcel Danesi suggests that symptomatologists have had priorities, studies of importance before and communication later
 jin-jequis natiez dwaara ativaadee drushti pesh kii gai, jinhone ek sangeet-shastrajna ke rup main apane lakshanikta ke anuprayog ke liye sampreshan ke saidhantik adhyayan ko apraasangik mana
 Semiotics differs from linguistics in the sense that it generalizes the definition of a sign so that signs can be incorporated into any medium or sensory system
 Thus it increases the prevalence of sign systems and sign relations and gives the definition of language its most elaborate rhetorical or semiotic meaning
 sanketon kii aavashyak visheshtaon ke adhyayan ke taur par shabd "semiotic" ke liye piers kii paribhaasha main use maanav vikaas ke kram main vishwa kii bhashaaon dwaara hasil aakasmik visheshtaon ke adhyayan ke rup main bhashaa vigyaan se alag karne kaa prabhaav shaamil he
 Perhaps it is more difficult to distinguish between semiotics and philosophy of language
 ek myne main, vishyon ke antar kii apeksha yah vastutah paramparaon ke bich kaa antar adhik he
 Various authors have named themselves "philosophers of language" or "semioticians"
 yah antar vishleshnatmak or mahadwipiya darshan ke algaav se mail nahin khaataa he
 Looking closely, some differences can be found with respect to subjects
 bhashaa kaa darshan, prakritik bhashaaon yaa saamaanya taur par bhashaaon par adhik dhyaan detaa he, jabaki lakshanikta kaa sambandh gaiyr bhashaai mahatv se adhik gaharaa he
 Philosophy of language also has a strong relationship with linguistics, while semiotics is close to certain humanities and cultural anthropology
 Semiosis yaa semeiosis aisi prakriya he jo sanketon ke madhyam se duniya ke bare main kisi bhi jeev kii ashanka se arth grahan karte hai
 The importance and significance of signs has been recognized throughout the history of philosophy and psychology
 plato or arestu donon ne sanketon or duniya ke rishton ke bich ke sambandh kaa pataa lagaaya or augustin ne paramparaagat pranali ke antargat sanket ke swabhaav par vichaar kiya
 These theories had a lasting impact on Western philosophy, especially through educational philosophy
 More recently, Umberto Eco has argued in his Semiotics and Philosophy of Language that semiotic theory is rooted in the works of most, possibly all leading thinkers
 is kshetra ke praarambhik vichaarkon main shaamil hai charles dablyoo
 morris
 maiks blike, bartrand rasel ke kaary ko praarambhik maanate hai
 Applications of semiotics include: lakshanikta keval dhire-dhire khud ko ek sammanneey vishay ke rup main sthapit kar rahi he
 In some countries, its role is limited to literary criticism and visual and audio medium only, but this narrow focus can extend to a broad general study of social and political forces on how active status can be shaped within modern culture
 
 vartmaan jansanchaar ke yug main sanchaar madhyamon ke chayan or sanchaar ranneetiyon kii dizine main praudyogiki niyatatvvaad ke mudde nae mahatv grahan karte hai
 The use of metaphorical methods to reveal various levels of meaning and sometimes hidden purposes has led some to give a hellish look to the elements of the subject as Marxists, Nashists etc

 Semiotics has produced several subfields, including but not limited to: sachitr lakshanikta kala ke itihaas or siddhant ke saath antarang rup se judi he
 However, it has moved ahead of both in at least one fundamental way
 jahaan kala ke itihaas ne uske drishy vishleshan ko chitron kii kam sankhya tak simit rakhaa he, jo "kalatmak rachana" ke rup main arhata rakhte hai, sachitr lakshanikta ne aam taur par chitron ke lakshanon par dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 This traditional history and theory of art — and at the same time, diverging from other major streams of semiotic analysis — allows for a wide variety of possibilities for pictorial semiotics
 ghatana-kriya vishleshan, sangyanatmak manovigyaan, sanrachanaatmak or sangyanatmak bhashaa-vigyaan tathaa drishyaatmak maanav-shaastra / samaaj-shaastra se kuch prabhaav grahan kiye gaye hai
 Diet has been a favorite traditional subject to illustrate semiotic theory, as it is highly accessible and can be easily linked to the life of the average person
 lakshanikta sanket prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan he, jab vah vyaktigat rup se yaa samoohon main sanchalit hota he or kis prakaar ye sanket prakriyaayein arth ko parichaalit karne or saath hi samajhane main antardrushti pradaan karti hai
 Diet is called symbolic because it changes its meaning when prepared
 ek junglee jaanavar dwaara laash se khaae gaye aahaar kii tulana kisi saanskrithik pakwaan kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye rasoighar main maanvon dwaara taiyaar aahaar se kiye jane par spashtatah arth badal jaataa he
 Food can also be called a symbol of some social gestures
 "agar khaadya padaarth ko ek sanket-paddati ke rup main vyavahrut kiya jaataa he, to jo sandesh vah kutabaddh karata he vah abhivyakt saamaajik sambandhon ke pattern main paaya jayega
 sandesh padanukram kii vibhinn shrenee, samavesh or bahishkaran, simaaen or simaaon ke paar len-dein ke bare main he"
 The diet is symbolic without regard to how it is prepared
 chaahe bhojan ko kisi achche dining restaraan main puri parishuddhta ke saath taiyaar kiya gaya he, yaa kooday ke dher se uthaaya gaya he, todaa, niglaa, yaa junglee jaanavar dwaara khaaya gaya he, tab bhi hameshaa hi is aadhaar par arth nikaala ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht aahaar ko kaise taiyaar kiya gaya or kis sandarbh main use parosa gaya
 Current research has found that, as branches develop and become more international, their symbols become more symbolic and less iconic
 kisi sanket kii pratishtha or pratikatmakataa saanskrithik paripati par nirbhar karti he or us aadhaar par ek duusare ke saath sambandhit hai
 If cultural practice has a strong influence on the sign, the sign acquires more symbolic value

 saathottaree hindi sahitya hindi sahitya ke itihaas ke antargat san 1960 i0 ke baad mukhyatah navlekhan yug se kaaphi had tak bhinnata kii pratiti karaane vaali aisi peedi ke dwaara rachit sahitya he jinamein vidroh evam araajaktaa kaa swar pradhan tha
 However, along with it, the parallel stream of spontaneity and democratic consciousness was also prevalent in the field of literature, which later became dominant
 saathottaree lekhan main vidrohi chetanayukta aandolan praathmik rup se kavita ke kshetra main mukhar hui
 Therefore, all the movements related to it were mainly poetry movements
 haalaanki kahani evam anya vidhaon par bhi iskaa asar paryaapt rup se padaa or kahani ke kshetra main bhi 'akahani' jaise aandolan ne rup dhaaran kiya
 Around sixty, the stream of new poetry began to look somewhat different from itself
 saath ke baad jo nayaa mode lakshith hota he vah ekaek deekhne vaali koi naveen vastu nahin, varan nayi kavita se hi phuta hua he
 The tone of discontent, disapproval and rebellion has emerged very clearly in the later sixties
 nayi kavita main bhi asantosh or asweekruti kaa swar vidyaman he, kintu saath ke baad is swar ne or tikhe vyangy or vidroh kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he, jivan kii tuutati murtiyon ke bahut kareeb jaakar unki tuutane kii talkhi, vyathaa or usamen se footati asweekruti kii ugrata ko pahachaanaa he
 The greatest feature of the new poem is that it conveyed authentic experiences of the whole life in their living environment
 vishay yaa anubhuti ke abhijatya or bhinn-bhinn drushtiyon yaa vaadon se bane hue unke gheron ko todakar vyakti dwaara bhoge jate hue jivan ke har chote-bade satya ko pratikon or bimbon ke madhyam se ubhaarne main hi usne kavita kii sarthakata samajhi
 But overall, despite the pain in the poets of the new poem, there remained a positive hope for future creation
due to the conditions of post- swatantryottar bharat kii tatkaaleen paristhitiyon ke kaaran unamem hataasha or tuutan kaa bhav kaaphi tha parantu sapane puure hone kii ek ksheen aashaa bhi bachi rahi thi
 Disillusionment or disillusionment did not occur as a whole, so the new poem has a sense of torture, a tone of disapproval, but not a revolt
 dhire-dhire 'ilugen' ek dam tut gayi, mohabhang ho gaya
 The social environment of the person started to look more ugly, dreams of the future were broken
 dow0 bachchan singh ke shabdon main kaviyon ke ugaae hue suraj main roshni nahin aayi-- surya kaa swaagat vyarth chalaa gaya
 Many litterateurs began to see only two ways that either they would express the intense feeling of pain by adding tone to the head of the new poem, or all these circumstances would make their sensitive mind emerge from the midst of torture and torture
 Everything started to inspire rejection
 sahitya main ye donon dharaayen raheen, parantu san saath ke turat baad vidrohi dhara pradhan rahi jinamein se adhikansh nirlakshya yaa yon-vikrutilakshi thim
 By being objective, these poems were conveniently revolting, that is, where there is a danger in rebellion, there is rebellion where there is convenience
 saathottaree hindi sahitya kaa pehla dashak aadhuniktawaad se vishesh prabhavit he
 It is important to note that there is a difference between modern and modernity
 'aadhunik' 'madhyakaalin' se alag hone kii soochna detaa he
 'modern' is the result of scientific inventions and industrialization while 'modernism' is the result of excesses of industrialization, metropolitan monotony, the catastrophe of two great wars
 dow0 bachchan singh ke anusaar "vastutah naveen gyaan-vigyaan, technology ke falswaroop utpann visham maanviya sthitiyon ke naye, gaiyr-romentic or amithkeey saakshaatkaar kaa naam 'aadhuniktaa' he
 " aadhuniktaavaadi sahitya ek vishesh prakaar kaa sahitya he
 It rejects established culture, values and sensibilities
 yah duniya kii manyataon ko manjuur nahin karti, parampara ko bedi ke rup main leti he
 The modernist undertakes interludes, mocking the values, he is a rebel
 bheed kaa virodh karata he, vah vyakti kii mukti kaa vishwasi he
 He finds himself in a non-human condition, and expels affection, gratitude etc
 sanyam kii kami, prayog, sahitya roopon kii tod-phod, shock dene kii manovriti, aakrosh-kshobh-hinsa kii aakanksha aadi isaki visheshtaayen yaa 'motiff' hai
 Among the many trends that were active in the poetry field, experiencing the isolation from the new poem, the most notable is Ginsberg, Rajkamal Chaudhary emerging in Hindi parallel to American Beatnik and hungry poets like Malay Raychaudhuri and Subimal Basak of Bengal influenced by them
 Some other poets associated with poetry and rejected poetry who wrote about 'hetero sexuality' and 'open secret' Specific assumptions made by adopting an attempt to your 'disfiliatt' society
 unki kavita main yon shabdaawalee kaa nanga prayog, apane vikshobh or aakrosh ko vyakt karne ke liye praayah ek sanskarahinta evam vikruti ke rup main miltaa he
 Rajkamal Chaudhary has been considered the leading poet of this decade
 raajakmal choudhary main aadhuniktaa apni samagrata main dikhaai padati he
 Chaudhary's imprint can be seen on most of the compositions of this time
 bitanic aandolan hindi main ek fishan kii tarah aayaa or kuch hi samay main nishprerak ho gaya kyonki uski jaden desh ke yatharth main nahin thim
 Actually he was a poet of anger
 apni aakroshpurna vaani main ye apana gussa utaarte rahe
 He continued to express his screams, wounds and sexual innuendo in poetry, rejecting all the previous values and traditions
 parantu, yuyutsavadi, nav pragatisheel yaa nav pragativaadee kaviyon ne saamaajik mulyon par bal dete hue in bitanicon se apni asahmati vyakt kii
 After the new poem, so many slogans were heard in a short period in the field of Hindi poetry, so many movements came that no other literature of the world had such a lot of slogans and movements in such a short period
 inamen se kuch andolan or naare to samay kii gard main hi dab gayi kintu kuch vikaas ke path par bade bhi
 In fact, the nutritious compositions of these movements were also similar to each other and sometimes the same poet followed many movements
 sahitya-rachana kaa yah samay andolanon kii arajak baadh kaa samay rahaa
 The names of these movements are mainly poem-oriented
 is dashak main baadh kii tarah aaye kavita-andolanon main vyavastha-virdohi andolanon ke saath-saath vyavastha-samarthak kai andolan bhi the; parantu praayah in sabhi andolanon main suvyavasthit chintan kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran praayah ye sabhi laghujivi siddh hue
 The general introduction of both these types of main movements is visible in the following headings
 march 1962 ke 'bharti' ke ank main srivirendrakumar jain ne 'sanathan suryodayi' nayi kavita kii ghoshnaa kii
 Expressing his intention, he said that "we are wandering in the shadow of the fall-defeat, frustration, self-defeating and self-destructive darkness of living suicides in front of today's orphaned poetic consciousness - carrying little to no importance, light from darkness Carrying in, taking in nectar from death and bringing down the limitless leela in the border - the imperative Sanatan Suryodayi Nutan Kavita stream tomorrow We do
 " is prakaar is andolan kaa mukhya swar vyavastha kaa hi tha, parantu lagbhag 3 saal baad hi 'bharti' ke hi farvari 1965 i0 ke ank main 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke sthaan par 'nutan kavita' kaa swar sunai dene laga
 Former supporters of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita' like Gangaprasad Vimal joined themselves in the 'akavita' category
 yuyutsavadi kavita kaa sambandh 'yuyutsa' naamak patrika se rahaa he
 Shalabh Sriram Singh was the originator of the Yutaswadi poetry
 unki manyata rahi he ki aadim yuyutsa hi sahityasarjan kii mul prerana he
 He says that "I accept the same primitive youth as the original inspiration for literature, which has been at the core of every revolution, change or dissolution somewhere
 vah yuyutsa jijeevishaavaadi, mumurshavadi, vidrohatmak athwa platonic kuch bhi ho sakati he
 "in 'roopambra' of April 1965, under the 'commencement', this quote of Shalabh Sriram Singh was given by the Swadesh Indians while declaring 'yuyotsa is the only cause of all'"
 'roopambara' ke hi agast 1966 ke 'adhunathan kavita ank' main 'yuyutsavadi navlekhan pradhan sahakaari prayaas' ke rup main saamne aayaa, teen kaviyon ke vaktavy sahit
 The editor also raised the issue of new sensibilities
 vimal pandeya, rameshwaradutt maanav, om prabhakar, bajrang bishnoi aadi ne bhi apane aap ko is andolan se sambandhit kiya
 Vimal Pandey tried to associate 'yuyotsavada' with 'angry Young Man'
 shri om prabhakar ne 'yuddhechha' ko sanathan vritti maanate hue yuyutsa ko jijeevishaa kaa paryaay mana he
 Bajrang Bishnoi has linked the question of commitment to Yuyutsa
 'utkarsh' patrika ke july '66 ke ank main shriram shukla ne 'asweekrut kavita' kaa naaraa buland kiya or 'ek lambii asweekrut kavita' 'mari hui aurat ke saath sambhog' sheershak se prastut kii
 For Shukla ji, the experience of sexual intercourse is enough - to carry seven epics
 ' asweekrut kavita ke pravaktaa kavi kii manyata he-- "satya ko satya na kah paane kii vishmata kabhi na kabhi avrodh todakar bah nikalati he or tabhi janm hota he asweekrut kavita kaa
 "and" is a communicative poem of specific tendencies, emotions, situations, values, inconsistencies and moods, disproved in the present era, but also rejected
 " asweekrut kavita yon vikrutiyon kii kavita he
 The use of vulgar words is readily accepted for them and according to them they are anxious to 'change disliked arrangements'
 hal na prastut kar sake to bhi 'un par prashn chihn lagaakar besudh logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa' ye apana kartavya samajhate hai
 Dr
 Shyam Parmar, the narrator of 'akvita', has been considered, but Jagdish Chaturvedi was also an equal partner with him and was among the early proponents of 'akvita'
 vastutah 'akavita' patrika ke teen sampadak the-- jagadish chaturvedi, shyaam parmaar or rabindranath tyaagi
 Theoretical articles in support of Akvita were often not published in 'akvita' magazine
 un logon kii manyata thi kii 'baat bolegi ham nahin'
 However, Dr
 Shyam Parmar also wrote a book titled 'akvita and art-references' in support of Akvita, which attempted to define multiple verses
 jagadish chaturvedi is varg ke kaviyon ke dwaara bauddhik str par jeeye gayi jivan kii ekangita, visangati tathaa kachot ko sapraan abhivyakti pradaan karne kii sachetanta ke kaaran tathaa kavy kii puraatan parampara se pruthakta ke kaaran is kavy ko 'abhinav kavy' kii sangya dete hue kehete hai ki "unhen 'anti-kavy' ke saarth-vaahakon ke rup main pariganit kiya ja saktaa he
 "but Shyam Parmar does not consider Akvita as anti-poetry or anti-poetry
 ve akavita ko 'antarvirodhon kii anveshak kavita' maanate hai
 According to him, the specialty of this poetry movement is in the fact that "the tendencies of poets are associated with different mindsets"
 " "akavita kaldharmee kavita he
 It will be a limited-time poem, as it will not have to hoist flags in the future
 " tathaa "akavita main abhivyakti ke anek str sambhav hai
 In language and narrative, he is not committed, hence 'flexible'
 usamen jatil or 'tipsi' prakriyaayein hai-- sidhi or tuuti baaten hai
 "akavita's spokesperson Kavi also mentions that" new poetry or newcomers are not worthy of opposition to Akavita
 aandolan vritti ke log vyarth hi ise gut yaa shadyantr kii sangya dete hai
 " akavita ke andolan ko bhi bitanic aandolan ke saath jude hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 However, its proponents Jagdish Chaturvedi and Shyam Parmar described the behavior of the Beatnikis as blasphemous and absolutely denied their involvement with 'akvita'
 san 1965 se 67 tak nikalne vaali 'akavita' patrika ke prastaavkon main girijakumar maathur, prabhakar machave, bharat bhushan agarwal, vimal or atul aadi ke naam bhi saamne aaye the
 In this context, the works of Saumitra Mohan and Mudrarakshas are also notable
 america bitanic prabhaav ke kaaran dow0 prabhakar machave, bangla prabhaav ke kaaran raajakmal choudhary tathaa ginsvarg ke prabhaav ke kaaran trilochan or shamsher bahadur singh ne bhi beet kavita se apane aap ko sambhddha kiya tha
 In magazines called 'kriti' and 'expression', Machwe ji also declared his belief
 elahabaad se prakashit 'vidrohi peedi' ke kaviyon par bhi apratyaksh rup se yah prabhaav dikhaa
 Laxmikant Varma was the promoter of 'fresh poetry'
 verma ji pehle 'nayi kavita' ke bade samarthakon main se the
 He wrote the first important book related to the theoretical analysis of new poetry, 'paradigms of new poetry'
 parantu, baad main manyata badalane par ve 'taaji kavita' ke pravartak bane
 She started the movement of 'fresh poetry' because in the new poem, there was no longer any 'newness' and she had become distinguished in a particular way
 verma ji kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki "nayi kavita kaa adhikansh paroksh rup se nabhinal dwaara chhayavaad se jeevanshkti letaa rahaa tha
 "however, even this movement of 'fresh poetry' could not go on
 july 1965 tak main hi verma ji kaa saath nibhaane vaala koi ek kavi yaa lekhak bhi saamne nahin aayaa or "bina kisi shor-gul ke, 'taaji kavita' ke tajie apane aap dafn ho gayi
 " patibaddh kavita ke saath dow0 parmanand shrivastav kaa naam judaa hua he
 Dr
 Srivastava's belief is: "I believe that there is no other option in front of Kavita to interview the entire humanitarian of today and fight against the dehumanization induced by the capitalist system
 " tathaa "patibaddh kavita ke daayre main 'bhashaa' ek mahatvapurn astr he-- uparyukt sangharsh kaa
 "dr
 Srivastava has also further defined the nature of the struggle--" Conflict is a straightforward and meaningful word in committed poetry - it has no disguise - people who do not accept any kind of commitment create false conflict and Let's enjoy it
 is prakaar yah andolan aadhuniktawaad athwa araajaktaa se dur vyavastha kaa hi andolan tha or marxvad kaa hi ek rup tha
 There was an ideology, a political vision behind it
 sahaj kavita kaa sutaradhar dow0 rabindra bhramar ko mana gaya he
 This movement also had no connection with modernism or far-fetchedness

 Dr
 Shyam Parmar and Rajkamal Chaudhary also supported it
 march 1967 main sahaj kavita kii vijyapti prakashit hui
 The excerpts of the communiqué are as follows: "after the '60s, the craftsmanship of manorism in a class was considered to be the original goal and Hindi poetry emerged as a trade of crooked lines altogether
 isiilie vah fishan rahi he or bahut arthpurna bhi nahin xxrep 4 
 "so the goal of this poem is to" search for poetry from afresh "
 dow0 paramanand shrivastav, rajendra prasad singh, dow0 kumaar vimal, shrikant joshi, dow0 shyamsundar ghosh, dow0 vishvambharnath upaadhyaay, dow0 ganapatichandra gupt tathaa shivapratap singh ne 1968 i0 main prakashit 'sahaj kavita' naamak sangrah ke apane lekhon main sahaj kavita kaa samarthan kiya
 Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar defined Sahaja poetry in his article as follows - "the etymological meaning of the word 'sahaj' in the context presented will have to be 'saha jayate iti sahajah
 ' arthath jo rachana yatharth anubhuti samveg ke saath vaani ke moort madhyam main janm leti he, vah sahaj he
 From this point of view, authenticity of cognition is the primary object
 anubhuti pratyaksh tathaa pramanik hui to abhivyakti akrutrim or ajatil hogi
 "and" Sahaja's demand is social, despite being objective
 " dow0 bhramar ne patibaddhta ke prashn ko bhi sahaj kavita ke saath sambhddha karke dekha he : "apane yug ke jivan or sarjanaatmak daayitv se sahaj kavita puri tarah patibaddh he
 At its core lies the realization of simple life and a sincere effort to search for a medium of simple craft
 " The name of the new song appeared in a magazine called 'geetangini' published from Muzaffarpur in February 1958
 is patrika main kuch navagit bhi sankalit the
 Some authors consider the development of the new song to be parallel to the new poem and consider it to be a special genre of new poetry
 'navagit' kaa pratham samavet sankalan 'kavita' 1964 main om prabhakar ke sampadan main prakashit hua
 With this, Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar, Ramdarsha Mishra and Dr
 Ramesh Kuntal appeared as spokespersons of the Megh Navgita
 is sankalan main niraala se lekar nayi peedi tak ke anek geetkaaron ke geet sankalit the
 This movement of the new song was completely different from the other sixty-second momentary movements
 na to ise araajaktaa aadi se koi lenaa-dena tha or na hi waisi shaak aadi dene kii koi pravriti
 This genre has established itself
