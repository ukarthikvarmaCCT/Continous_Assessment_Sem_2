uttar pradesh ke bulandshahr ke ek college kaa haal ab lete hai
 Bulandshahr has two government and 10 aided degree colleges, most of the colleges are short of teachers
 1956 main diavi degree college banane ke liye bulandshahr ke vyapaariyon ne khub daan diya, zamin di

 aaj yahaan 3000 se adhik chaatr to padhate hai magar padhaane vaale shikshak nahin hai
 40 posts are acceptable, but work is going on with 20 teachers

 All these 20 professors have been teaching only temporarily for 20-20 years

 Teachers have been teaching here temporarily for twenty years
 usee tarah chemistry vibhaag kii adhyaksh suvidha choudhary bhi kai saal se yaha edock par padhaa rahi hai
 You might wonder what would be happening to the students of this college
 ham bhavishya bana rahe hai yaa bhavishya bigaadane kaa rashtriya project chal rahaa he bharat main
 Unbelievable when Professor Vikas Sharma, President of Meerut University Association, said that sixty percent posts in degree colleges are vacant all over UP
 agar itane pad khaali hai jo phir itane chunaav ho chuke, kabhi ye sab mudda kyon nahin bana
 Did nobody want a job in college, did the students have to study without a professor
 phir se rajasthan chalate he

 The posts of 648 teachers have been approved but only 324 teachers are regular
 kisi guest faikalti ko ek class ke liye 500 miltaa he to kisi ko 300 bhi miltaa he
 Now the government has found a new way
 puraane guest faikalti ko hataa kar unki jagah ritair prophessoron ko rakhaa jane laga he
 Where the youth should have been given jobs, but the rights of the youth are being killed by taking work from the retired people
 gaiyr shikshak main bhi bhayankar kami he
 There are 801 posts sanctioned but more than 200 posts are vacant
 2013 main is uniwarsity main bahaali hui thi magar ghotaale kaa aarope lag gaya
 The investigation of the Anti Corruption Bureau is still going on
 uniwarsity main inkaa ek cameraa bhi ban gaya he
 Many employees, including professors, have been arrested in this case
 sidinket member or vaais chancelar bhi jail ja chuke hai
 This time in the history of the university, the first female president has been elected here
 enesayuai kii kanta jwaala teacher bhale na ho, visi jail ja chuke hai magar uniwarsity main itihaas kaa bananaa jari he
 The comments hamaare sahyogi arun harsh 13 saal tak guest lekturer ke rup main padhaane vaale maakhanlaal ke ghar aae hai
 From 2001 to 2013, Makhanlal has taught economics to arts and commerce students

 Never could earn more than 7-8 thousand
 jainarayan vyas uniwarsity se hi eme or piechdi karke vahiin padhaa rahe the magar 13 saal ke baad uniwarsity ne tata kar diya
 Teaching in the hope that due to physical challenges will be permanent, but when the vacancy came in 2008, the post did not come for him
 ab ve theke par bhi nahin padhaa sakate hai
 Because the rule has changed
 jo ab ritair hoga vahi theke par padhaa sakegaa
 The Housing Board lives in a house which is its own
 do bachche hai
 She is 44 years old
 kisi ne bataaya ki elahabaad uniwarsity main bhi kai sau pad shikshakon ke khaali hai
 There are 18 posts approved in the Zoology Department, but here also 7 guests are teaching and five are permanent
 baaki 6 pad khaali hai
 The guest who is teaching did not get more than 25000 of the month
 is kaarykram ke baad jagah-jagah se shikshakon ne mail kiya he, kaha ki meri report or bhi bhayaavah ho sakati thi, isamen ye kami he wo kami he, vitt poshit kalege kii baat nahin he, privet kalejon main kis tarah paanch hazaar se aath hazaar par logon ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa gaya he ye abhi tak nahin ai
 Are you sure you were not talking anything on political topics, some must have been discussing, these leaders, those leaders, then how did they forget their issues
 ye to shikshakon kii baat hui, chaatro ke saath kitna khilwaad ho rahaa he
 So review the colleges in your area, talk to them, question them
 biaar ambedkar uniwarsity ne 2017-18 ke liye jo bajet report rajya sarkaar ko bheji he, use dekhakar sthiti to or bhi bhayaavah nazar aati he
 Some are giving the accounts of the colleges so that the youth there can pressurize their representatives for permanent appointment
 uniwarsity ke piji department main 230 shikshak hone chahien magar 101 hi padhaa rahe hai
 In RC College, Sakra, only 4 are teaching instead of 24 teachers
 doctor esake sinha mahila kalege motihaari main 29 shikshak hone chahie magar hai sirf 7
 MJK College, Bettiah has 67 posts but only 17 teachers are posted
 ek uniwarsity kii suchi dekhakar lagata he ki jaanboojh kar padon ko nahin bharaa ja rahaa he
 Either there is no recruitment or if the process continues for many years
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki ilaake ke sabhi bade logon ko yah baat maaloom he
 Young people also know this
 magar kisi ko nahin dekha ki sabane milakar vidhayak or saansadon par dabaav daalaa ho ki college main niyuktiyaan hon, padhai thik se chale
 Now take the condition of a college in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh
 bulandshahr main do sarkari or 10 aded degree college hai, zyaadaatar collejon main teacheron kii kami he
 In 1956, Bulandshahr merchants donated a lot of land to build a DAV degree college
 us vakt shahar kaa yah akele piji college tha
 Today, more than 3000 students study here, but there are no teachers to teach
 40 pad manzur hai magar 20 shikshakon ke bharose kaam chal rahaa he
 Can 20 teachers teach 3000 students
 ye sabhi 20 professor 20-20 saal se asthaayee taur par hi padhaa rahe hai
 That is, there is not a single permanent teacher in this college
 angrezi vibhaag ke adhyaksh to 23 saal se edock padhaa rahe hai
 His salary has increased from 2200 to 8000 in 23 years
 bees-bees saal se shikshak yahaan asthai taur par padhaa rahe hai
 Similarly, Faculty of Chemistry Department Suvidha Chaudhary has also been teaching here on Adhawk for many years
 aap soch sakate hai ki is college ke chaatro ke saath kya ho rahaa hoga
 We are creating a future or a national project to spoil the future is going on in India
 yakeen hi nahin hua jab meerut uniwarsity association ke adhyaksh professor vikaas sharma ne bataaya ki puure upi main degree collejon main saath fisadi pad khaali hai
 If there are so many vacancies which have been held so many elections, why did not all these issues ever arise
 kya kisi ko college main naukari nahin chahie thi, kya chaatro ko bagaiyr professor kii padhanaa tha

 It has become difficult to count the number of ceasefire violations in 13 years
 hajaar se zyada baar yudhviram kaa ulanghan ho chukaa he or jaise lagata he ki ye bas ek aupchaarikta bhar rah gaya he
 In fact, this ceasefire has proved to be a hollow agreement

 duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye paak apane sabase khaas aatanki hafiz said or uske sanghathan ko bachaane ke liye edi chotii kaa jor laga rahaa he
 Sources in the Indian Intelligence Agency have revealed that Pakistan is only pretending to ban JUD
 iske badale pakistan kii asaliyat ye he ki usne JUD ke liye kaam karne or kashmir aatank ko badhaava dene ke liye do nae sanghathan bana die hai
 Through which he will be able to raise funds
 aazatak ko mili jaankaree ke mutabiq pakistan kii kufia agency ISI kii shai paraatanki hafiz saidane jammu kashmir movement (JKM) or Rescue, Relief and Education Foundation (RREF) naamak 2 nae sanghathan banaae hai

 On this move of Pakistan, PK Sehgal, who knows about security matters, said that "hafiz Saeed has many organizations
 har baar jab uske upar antarrashtriya dabaav padataa he, to vah turant usee organijeshan kaa naam badalakar alag kaam karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 So that none of his accounts can be seized and he can transfer money to other organizations

 Sources reveal that Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has asked Lashkar and Jamaat-ud Dawa militants to join these two new groups
 taaki badale naam se bharat ke khilaaf aatanki gatividhiyon ko jari rakhaa ja sake or duniya kii najaron se pakistan in aatanki guton ko bachaa sake
 There was also a report in Pak media that under pressure from the US, Pak is taking steps against JUD

 He said, 'we took action on these so that our children are safe in schools
 pakistan ne said nit jeyudi or exef ko chanda lene ko lekar ko pratibandhit kar diya tha
 Earlier, US President Donald Trump alleged that Islamabad did not give America anything other than lies and deceit
 trump ne kaha tha ki pakistan ne aatankwaadiyon ko surakshit panaahagaah muhaiyaa karai he
 The government of Pakistan then banned companies and people from donating to the JUD, FIF and other organizations according to the UN Security Council sanctions list

 Just a week before this video surfaced, on June 13, there were 6 serial terrorist attacks in the valley

 The terrorists also attacked the security personnel of the High Court judge in Anantnag
 anantnag se pahalgam kii duuri mahaj 43 kimi he
 Questions are also arising because the infiltration of terrorists increases with the melting of snow in the valley

 The terrorists who defeated the preparations of the security forces, the Pakistan Army and ISI are plotting to infiltrate a large number of mercenaries into Indian territory

 Film Name: juniyotdirector: Vivek agnihotristar Cast: Pulkit Samrat, Yami Gautam, Gulshan Devaiah, Hrishita Bhatt Duration: 2 Hours 09 Minutes Certificate: u Rating: 1 directorvivek Malhotran has made his first romantic film about Staryami Gautam and Pulkit Samrat
 vaise yami or pulakit kii jodi ko iske pehle 'sanam re' film main bhi dekha gaya he jisaki kam saraahna kii gai thi
 Let's know how this film is
 
 
 kahani:film kii kahani indian army ke captain jahaan bakshi (pulakit samraat) or suhaani kapur (yami kapur) kii he
 During one incident, Suhani meets Jahan and the two fall in love with each other
 lekin pyaar kii is kahani main twist tab aata he jab suhaani ke gharavaalon ko is rishte se naaraazgi hoti he
 Will this love between Jahan and Amrutsar Kudi Suhani, posted on the country's border, get the right result? You will know about it only by watching the film
 script:film kii kahani tipicallav storijaisi hi he jisamen koi bhi logic nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Anjan girl is caught swimming in the army area and Head Saab invites her to a night party
 ittefaq pe ittefaq puri film main hote rahete he
 The story is extremely weak and there is nothing that is appealing
 script or bhi behatar ho sakati thi
 Also, it seems that special sequences have been prepared to fit the songs, due to which the speed of the film is affected
 vaise shaayari kaa acha istemaal film main kiya gaya he
 Acting: Pulkit Samrat is seen speaking dialogues like Salman Khan once again, due to which very expressive expressions are seen in every frame
 yami gautam ne thik thaak acting kii he
 But there is nothing that can be appreciated more
 dono actors kii maujuudagi ke baad bhi kaaphi khalipan sa najar aata he
 Weak Link: The weak link of the film is its script, length and hill dule sequences which are very difficult to connect
 sangeet:film kaa sangeet bahut hi acha he
 The songs are a hit even before release but during the scene these songs are seen to be forcefully fitted
 gaanon ko istemaal behatar dhang se kiya ja saktaa tha
 This time, the Congress made a special strategy for the Gujarat elections
 22 saalon se rajya kii satta se baahar rahi congress ko lagata he ki itane saalon kii satta virdohi lahar, patidaar, dalit, obisi andolan or saamne siem kii kursi par narendra modi kaa na hona uske liye acchhee khabar laa sakate hai
 If sources are to be believed, the biggest fear for the Congress was that the BJP may be the last bet of hindu-muslim in Gujarat
 congress ko lagata he ki 2002 ke dangon ke baad se BJP hindu-muslim maton ke bantwaare ke chalate hi chunaav jitati aa rahi he
 For this, the then CM Modi used to inform Congress President Sonia Gandhi's political advisor and Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel on the last occasion even as the Chief Ministerial candidate
 congress lakh manaa kare lekin ahamed kaa party main rutaba or kad itnaa rahaa he ki vah gujarat ke sabase bade netaa maane jate rahe hai
 Only then Modi's speeches used to mention jumleas like Mian Ahmed Patel
 isiilie is baar BJP kaa yah daanv naa chalane paae
 For this, the Congress has prepared a special 5 point agenda
 yah he congress kaa5 sutreey agenda1
 Rahul Gandhi will go to temples only and create a soft Hindutva image of the party
 2
 Ahmed Patel, who always denied himself to be a contender for the chief minister, decided that he would remain active from behind the scenes
 3
 All the Muslim leaders of the party will talk to the other Muslim organizations secretly and appeal to them to stay away from inflammatory things

 Instead of replying to such a statement of a BJP leader, it should be put on the back burner, which is a possibility of communal polarization at all

 Those who suffer from chronic migraine headaches have up to three times the likelihood of severe jaw disease
 ek shodh main yah baat saamne ai
 Researchers said the findings of the research showed that temporomandibular disorder (TMD) directly affects the joints of the jaw rather than causing migraine
 haalanki tiemdi, migraine ke ek hamale kii tivrata or aavriti donon ko badha saktaa he
 Leadan Florencio, a researcher and lead researcher at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, said migraine is a neurological disease with a multitude of causes, while TMD, neck pain and other brain cell disorders are a series of factors that affect migraine sufferers
 And increases the frequency of disease
 pichley adhyayan ye darshaate hai ki migraine kis tarah chabane main madadgaarmasapeshiyon main dardase judaa hota he
 The temporomandibular joint performs the same function of occupancy as attaching the jaw to the skull bone, so difficulty with chewing and tension of the joints include symptoms of the disorder
 florenciyo ne kaha ki kendriya samvedikaran se migraine ke hamalon kii aavriti or tiemdi kii gambhirtha ke bich ke sambandh kii vyakhya ho sakati he
 They stated that recurrence of migraine attacks may increase pain sensitivity
 shodh kii report 'jarnal of manipulative and physiological theraputics' main prakashit hui he
 For the study, the team looked at women around the age of 30 who had no chronic migraine or episodic migraine or history of migraine
 jinhen migraine kii shikaayat nahin thi, unamem 54 pratishat tiemdi ke lakshan paae gaye, jabaki praasangik migraine ke saath 80 pratishat or puraane migraine vaali mahilaon main iske 100 pratishat lakshan paae gaye
 Researchers have said that people with migraines have a high probability of having TMD, while people with TMD may not necessarily have migraines
 bangkok kii ek court ne daaud ibrahim ke gurgey munna jhingada ko pakistani manisase pehle 8 agast 2018 main bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ne jeet liya tha yahi kesachhota rajan par bangkok main hamalaa karne vaale daaud ibrahim ke gurgey munna jhingada kaa cese thailand kii adaalat main bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ke khilaaf gaya, pehle cese bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ne jeeta tha or tab sabit kar diya tha ki munna jhingada bhartiya naagarik he, lekin uske baad pakistan khufia agency iesai ne daaud ke ishaare par bangkok kii adaalat main apil file kii or is baar adaalat ne use pakistani naagarik qaraar diya
 Sources reveal that for this Dawood shed money like water
 8 agast 2018 main bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ne pakistani khufia agency ke tamaam jhuthe daavon ko adaalat main galat sabit kiya tha or cese jeet liya tha
 After this, there is an opportunity for an appeal in which Dawood Ibrahim invested money and on 11 September 2019, the court considered Munna as a Pakistani citizen
 bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ko jhatkapichley 2 saal se bainkak kii adaalat main daaud ibrahim ke khaas gurgey saiyad muddasar hossain urf munna jhingada ko lekar bhartiya jaanch agenciyon or pakistan jaanch agenciyon ke bich khinchataan chal rahi thi, jisamendaaood ibrahimne is baar jamkar paisa bahaya or cese pakistan ke paksh main chalaa gaya
 While the Indian investigating agency wanted Munna Jhingra to be deported to India
 saiyad muddasar hossain urf munna jhingada ne daaud ibrahim ke ishaare par saal 2000 main bainkak main chota rajan par hamalaa kiya tha jisamen chota rajan ko goli lagi thi, lekin wo chat se kud kar bhaag kar apni jaan bachaane main kaamyaab rahaa tha jabaki uskaa saathi rohit verma maaraa gaya tha
 After the attack, Munna Jhingra was arrested in Bangkok and a Pakistani passport was recovered from him
 tab se munna jhingada bangkok kii jail main band he
 2 years ago, Indian investigative agencies filed an appeal in Bangkok court to report Munna Jhigda to India and gave all the evidence, after which Dawood & Company, through ISI, hired a famous lawyer in Bangkok
 8 agast 2018 ko bharat cese jeet gaya tha, lekin faisle ke khilaaf apil file karne kaa adhikaar bangkok main har kaidi ko he or jiskaa usne istemaal kiya
 Then on 19 September 2019, the verdict went against the Indian investigative agencies
 munna he bharat kaa naagarik, ISI kii khuli polpakistan munna ko saleem bataata he or adaalat main uski shaadi kaa jhootha certificate bhi daakhil kiya tha
 Not only this, Pakistan proved Munna's dead father dead
 pakistan ne in sabake liye kai farji dastavej banaae or adaalat main daakhil kiya
 In the first appeal, which was telling Pakistan Munna's father was dead, Indian investigative agencies kept the same Munna's father alive in Bangkok court
 itnaa hi nahin bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ne diene sample tak adaalat main die the tab jaakar cese bharat ke paksh main rahaa tha
 But now that the Indian Investigation Agency case has been lost, but it proves once again that Dawood is in Pakistan
 bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ne adaalat main jab daaud ibrahim or iesai ko jhatka diya or cese jeet liya, jisase khilaaf court main apil file kii gai
 So is Dawood in Pakistan? According to sources, this time Dawood shed money like water and won the case through fake documents, Dawood and ISI are afraid that if Munna India is deported, India will face the world Will open the pole of his terrorist antics
 chota rajan par hamalaa karne vaale daaud ke shooter ko pakistani sabit kar use pakistan deport karne kii jid ek baar phir ye sabit karti he ki daaud pakistan main hi chupa hua he or wo bhi iesai kii saraparasti main

 In his address on this occasion, PM Modi said that the results of the census of tigers will please every Indian and every nature lover
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki aaj ham garv ke saath kah sakate hai ki lagbhag 3000 baaghon ke saath bharat duniya ke sabase bade or sabase surakshit habetats main se ek he
 He said that it was decided in St

 iske liye 2022 tak kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya gaya tha
 We met this goal four years ago in India

 PM Modi said that i will tell the people associated with this area that the story that started with 'ek Tha Tiger' has reached 'tiger Zinda Hai', they should not stop there
 keval tiger jinda he, se kaam nahin chalegaa
 The efforts related to tiger conservation should be further expanded

 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki hamaari nitiyon main, hamaare arthshaastra main, hamen sangrakshan ke bare main baatcheet ko badalanaa hoga
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has been banned thrice during the British Raj, is now the government, and its credit goes to its 'activist' Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 kal, 15 agast ko RSS pramukh mohan bhagwat ne durlabh tareeke se behad udaar shabdon main anuchhed 370 ko hataakar kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm kiye jane ke liye pradhanmantri kii saarvajanik rup se saraahna kii
 Using the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) election slogan, the RSS sarsanghchalak said, "article 370 is gone because Modi is there, it is possible
" 
 
 "RSS or usase jude sanghathanon ke sangh parivaar kii teen buniyadi ichchhaaon main se ek tha kashmir ko anuchhed 370 ke antargat die ja rahe visheshadhikaron kaa khaatmaa
 Apart from this, the remaining two wishes of the Sangh Parivar are - to implement the Common Civil Code (uniform Civil Code) to prevent people of different religions from following their own laws on issues such as marriage and land ownership
 Construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya
 maine is aalekh ke liye BJP tathaa sangh ke kai netaaon se baat kii
 He said two important things somewhere
 (pradhanmantri narendra) modi or unke sheersh sahyogi va kendriya grahamantri amit shah ne (RSS pramukh mohan) bhagwat tathaa unke naayab bhaiyaji joshi ko aashwaasan diya he ki anuchhed 370 ke baad agenda par maujuud anya do icchhaaen bhi modi ke pradhanmantri ke rup main maujuuda kaarykaal main hi puri kar di jaaengi
 Right now, the RSS, which is working fully with Modi, has also offered its electoral support through its wide network of volunteers and offered Modi a place among the great leaders of the Sangh (modi in his speech on the occasion of Independence Day The mention of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the leading thinker of the Sangh, who died in Kashmir in 1953, was not a mere coincidence
 
 
 )RSS or modi ke bich rishte hameshaa se itane achche nahin rahe hai, kyonki modi ke pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan modi se jude adhiktar maamalon ko party adhyaksh kii haisiyat se amit shah hi sambhalate rahe the
 He made a habit of calling Bhagwat twice a week, and was always available to meet top RSS leaders
 amit shah har maheene nagpur jaaya karte the, taaki sunishchit ho sake ki vah or bhagwat har kadam ke bare main jaankaree rakhte hon, or sarkaar kaa koi bhi kadam sangh ke liye hairaan karne vaala sabit nahin ho
 The economy is now looking towards a deep crisis, so the BJP is of the opinion that by continuing to work on the cultural and ideological agenda its basic voter will be satisfied, and it will also be ensured that the newspaper headlines are only about unemployment and recession
 Don't stay about behad shaktishaalee logon kaa ek chota-sa samooh aane vaale kadamon ko lekar saavdhaanee se kaam kar rahaa he
 a senior BJP leader, who is familiar with the upcoming plans, says, "article 370 was part of our manifesto, but nobody was sure that we would fulfill the promise, but we did
" 
 
 modi or shah sangh kaa hissaa nahin hai, ve hi sangh hai, or man kii awaz par kaam karne vaale netaa hai
 
 
 They know that the removal of Article 370 will benefit us politically
 
 
 bharat ab is sachai ko sweekaar karne se sakuchaata nahin he ki ham 'hindu pradhan desh' hai
 
 
 The mood has changed
 
 
 modi vichaardhaara ke antargat sarkaar chalaa rahe hai or vakt aa gaya he ki RSS deshbhar ke saamne aae or sunishchit kare ki hamaare hi mulya deshbhar main parilakshith hon
 
 
 "right now the RSS is running the country, so the matter of coming forward can be debated
 raisina hill ke sheersh par sthit ghar (raashtrapati bhawan) se lekar sheersh sarkaar karyaalayon or north va south block main sthit mantralayon tak sab kuch purv sangh prachaarkon dwaara hi chalaaya ja rahaa he
 The RSS is receiving unprecedented funding to spread its ideology across the country
 iske alaava, purv raashtrapati dow pranab mukherjee jaise diggaj nagpur sthit uske mukhyalay main aane lage hai
 Even the mention of population control in the speech given by Modi on Independence Day is part of a script written thoughtfully
 modi sarkaar aisi yojana par pehle se kaam kar rahi he, jiske tahat chote pariwaron ko laabh pahunchaaya jaae
 So what to expect now
 
 
 ? arthvyavastha ko aage badhaane vaale kadam uthaae jaaenge, jin kadamon ko 'tex terarism' kii sangya di gai, un par kadam peeche nahin hataaya jayega, udyogpatiyon ko samajhaayaa jayega ki tex dekar aap arthvyavastha main yogadan den
 And major steps will be taken on the Common Civil Code and Ram Mandir
 ab ram mandir maamle main supreme court rozaana sunwaayee kar rahaa he, so, sarkaar ko ummid he ki uttar pradesh main agle saal hone vaale ahm chunaav se pehle sakaaratmak faisla aa jayega
 It is easy to pass the Uniform Civil Code in both houses of Parliament, probably in the same manner as Article 370
 sangh ke ek varisht vichaarak kaa kahana he ki kashmir (par faisle) ke saath modi ne apana naam hameshaa ke liye itihaas main darj kar liya he
 "good or bad, history will decide, but for the Sangh, he has surpassed any other BJP leader, including Atal and Advani," he said
 
 
 " so, is vakt, jo vah kar rahe hai, vahi karne do

 As soon as the presidential election is over, the name of the Vice Presidential candidate has been stamped in the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting

 At the same time, Gopalakrishna Gandhi has been made a candidate from the opposition
 naidu piem modi or party adhyaksh amit shah ke bhi bharosemand hai
 Read why Venkaiah Naidu is perfect for the BJP for this post
 1
 The face of South is Venkaiah Naidu from Andhra Pradesh
 endie raashtrapati pad ke liye pehle hi uttar bharat se ramnath kovind elaan kar chuki he
 It is expected that he will also become the President
 puure desh main apni jaden majboot karne kii koshish karne kaa plan kar rahi bijepi ke liye ye ek mauka he
 If the BJP runs the gamut of the South, then a path will also be ready for 2019
 2
 Rajya Sabha veteran Venkaiah Naidu has been a four-time Rajya Sabha MP
 vah rajasthan se saansad hai
 BJP also lacks numbers in Rajya Sabha, if a veteran Rajya Sabha leader is elected to this post, it will be easy to run the House
 naidu pehali baar rajyasabha ke liye 1998 main chune gaye the iske baad se hi 2004, 2010 or 2016 main vah rajyasabha ke saansad bane
 Apart from this, Venkaiah Naidu has been a part of many committees
 3
 After the meeting between the Sangh and the BJP, the trusted face of the party, there were reports that the BJP wants a face who understands the ideology of the Sangh and the BJP
 naidu 1975 ke dauraan immergency main jail bhi gaye the
 He was also the President of Youth Wing during the Janata Party time between 1977 and 1980
 1978 main ve vidhayak bhi chune gaye the
 Apart from this, Naidu has also held many important posts in the party, vice-president of National BJP Youth Wing between 1980 and 1983, Andhra Pradesh bjp's Leader of Opposition in 1980 to 85 Legislative Assembly, President of Andhra Pradesh BJP between 1988 and 1993 Become 1993 se 2000 tak naidu bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv bane, 2002 main ve pehali baar bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane
 He remained the chairman till December 2002
 iske baad 2004 main dobaaraa ve adhyaksh bane
 He was made Senior Vice President of BJP after April 2005, after 2006 Venkaiah was made a member of BJP Parliamentary Board and a member of Central Election Committee
 4
 Along with the big face of the government, Venkaiah Naidu is also a big face in the government
 pradhanmantri narendra modi, grahamantri rajnath singh, vittamantri arun jetali, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke baad venkaiya hi sabase senior mantri hai
 Venkaiah was the Minister of Rural Development during the Atal Government, while he took the reins of the Urban Development Ministry during the Modi Government
 iske alaava naidu ne sansadeey kaarymantri, soochna prasaaran mantri kaa kaarybhaar bhi sambhala
 5
 rajyasabha main phayda, mantrimandal main nuksabgar bijepi naidu kaa cheharaa aage karti he to rajyasabha main kam sankhya hone ke baavjood bhi ve sthiti ko sanbhaalane main kargar sabit honge
 However, there will be a setback for Modi in his cabinet, as Naidu has been seen giving a befitting reply to the opposition for PM Modi on several occasions during his three-year tenure

 He also alleged that Akhilesh and SP have retained the identity of Yadavs as "anti-nationals" and their "blind devotees" do not understand this
 ‘nirahua' ne yahaan ''pitiai-bhashaa'' ko die saakshaatkaar main kaha, ''akhilesh yadavon ke netaa kehalaate hai or ‘yadav' kehete hi logon ko lagata he ki sapa kaa aadmi he
 If you have become the identity of the Yadavas, then why are you bringing that identity down so much? You are going to stop an honest man (modi) by forming an alliance
 aisa kyon ?"bhojpuri filmon ke superstar ne kaha, '' agar mulaayam singh yadav pradhanmantri pad kii daud main hote to main unka samarthan karata
 If Akhilesh were to become Prime Minister, i would have supported him
 lekin vah to daud main nahin hai

 '' unhone kaha, ''aap (akhilesh) pradhanmantri banane kii daud main shaamil hote to samaj main aata ki aap modi ji se ladanaa chaahate hai
 You do not have to become Prime Minister, yet you are losing the pride of the Yadavas

 The benefits of Prime Minister Modi's works and schemes have reached every household
 logon ne pehle se hi man bana liya he
 "will Nirhua stay away from active politics or BJP in the event of defeat?" To this he said, "I will remain in politics and remain in BJP
 main azamgarh main ek-ek vyakti ko bhaajapa se jodoonga
 i have come to end the politics of casteism and dynasty
 '' ‘nirahua' ne yah bhi kaha ki jeetne par vah azamgarh main filmon kii zyaadaatar shooting karenge or janata kii seva bhi karte rahenge

 i cigarette (e-cigarette)par pratibandh ko yuvaaon evam bacchon ke swasthya ke liye mahatvapurn kadam bataate hue swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan mantri da
 Harshvardhan said on Wednesday that many tobacco companies in the world wanted to target the youth by introducing e cigarette products in India, so as a responsible government, we have banned it
 electronic cigarette (utpaadan, vinirmaan, aayaat, niryaat, parivahan, vikray, vitaran, bhandaaran or vigyaapan) pratishedh vidheyak, 2019 par loksabhaa main hui charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan mantri da
 Harshvardhan said that big tobacco companies are in the business of e-cigarettes under different names and many of these companies wanted to introduce their products in India
 swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan mantri ne kaha, ''yah sahi he ki bharat main kul aabaadi ke kareeb 0
 E-cigarettes are reported to be used by 2 percent, but a recent school surprise inspection found 150 evaporation devices in children's bags
 aise main hamaara maananaa he ki yuvaaon ke sandarbh main khaas taur par iske gambhir khatre hai''
 He said that the e-cigarette being offered as a symbol of modernity is being promoted through its attractive design, smoke marketing and glamor in advertising, but it is necessary to protect the youth from its harmful effects
 mantri ne kaha ki agast 2018 main ek janhit yachika par dilli ucch nyaayalay ne mantralay se is sambandh main ek niti banane ko kaha tha
 The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) suggested a ban on e-cigarettes in its white paper
 america main bhi haal ke samay main i cigarette ke hanikaarak prabhaav saamne aae hai
 Dr
 harshavardhan ne kaha ki i cigarette kaa swasthya par hanikaarak prabhaav hota he
 This affects the lungs, heart, liver, and other diseases including hypertension
 unhone kaha, ''aise main ek jimmedaar sarkaar hone ke naate pehle ham ise pratibandhit karne ke liye adhyadesh le kar aae or ab ham vidheyak lekar aae hai''
 He said that once the e-cigarette has spread in the country, the subject would become serious, so we took precaution
 mantri ke jawaab ke baad sadan ne sadasyon kii ore se laaye gaye sanshodhano ko asweekaar karte hue electronic cigarette (utpaadan, vinirmaan, aayaat, niryaat, parivahan, vikray, vitaran, bhandaaran or vigyaapan) pratishedh vidheyak, 2019 ko manjuuri pradaan kar di
 The Health and Family Welfare Minister said that there is strong evidence that e-cigarettes are very harmful in terms of health
 isamen farmeldihide, baari dhaatuen, benzene jaise tatv hote hai jo cancerkari hote hai
 Glycogen and nicotine are found in the e fluid present in it, which is poisonous
 unhone kaha ki isamen nicotine sulphate paaya jaataa he jiskaa pehle kitnashak main upyog kiya gaya lekin baad main ise kitnashak ke upyukt bhi nahin paaya gaya
 The minister said that by 2025 a target has been set to reduce tobacco consumption by 30 percent
 electronic cigarette (utpaadan, vinirmaan, aayaat, niryaat, parivahan, vikray, vitaran, bhandaaran or vigyaapan) pratishedh vidheyak, 2019 vidheyak kanoon banane ke baad haal hi main is sambandh main jari adhyadesh kii jagah legaa
 The central government issued an ordinance in September to ban these products, citing the health hazards posed to people, especially the youth, from e-cigarettes
 sarkaar ne iske saath hi i-hukke ko bhi pratibandhit kiya he
 The Bill states that for violation of this law, for the first time, in the case of crime, imprisonment for one year or fine up to one lakh rupees or both; And imprisonment up to three years and a fine of up to five lakh rupees or both for the next offense
 is vidheyak ke anusaar, i cigarette kaa bhandaaran bhi dandaneey hoga or iske liye chah maheene tak kii sajaa yaa 50 hajaar rupaye tak jurmaana athwa donon kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 The objectives and reasons of the Bill stated that e-cigarettes are electronic devices that heat any substance, including or without nicotine and aroma, for inhalation, which the user uses for smoking
 iske tahat sabhi prakaar kii electronic nicotine paridaan pranali, hukka baar or is prakaar kii anya yuktiyaan aati hai
 It states that the available scientific evidence shows that the use of e-cigarettes is a risk for the active user
 i-cigarette ke ghol or utsarjan ko nuksaandaayak mana jaataa he
 The Bill provides that the authorized officer will have the right to enter and search the premises where electronic cigarette packages are placed and to seize such stocks and their components

 inamen sirf hatya ke 35 maamle hai
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Bablu was a resident of Sisuvabathan village in East Champaran district and was the self-styled president of Bihar People's Liberation Front
 bablu ke khilaaf hatya, rangadari, apharan sahit 50 se zyada maamle darj hai
 Of these, there are only 35 murder cases
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Still do not know what will become the main issue of the election this time
 iske pehle ke16loksabhaa chunaavon kaa anubhav hamaare paas he
 It has never happened that even after the announcement of the election, it is not known what the main issues will be on the election, otherwise it was known only six months before the election
 lekin is baar koi atkal lagaate hai to do-chaar hafte main chunavi mudda khisak letaa he
 Six months ago, it seemed that this time the farmers' plight and unemployment would be the biggest issue, but both of these things were not suitable for the ruling party, so instead of this, every effort was made to create emotional issues of lasting sentiment in the country
 lekin puraane padane ke kaaran ve bhaavnaatmak mudde bhi thahar nahin paae
 Recently there was an attempt to create terrorism and hindu-muslims
 lekin ghatnakram aisa rahaa ki chunavi mudda banane ke liye aatankwaad par fori chot kaa kaam sadh nahin paaya
 Recently, diplomatic failure to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist ended the possibility of terrorism becoming an election issue
 uske bhi pehle vikaas kii baat chalaane kii bhi koshish hui
 But amidst the news of catastrophic unemployment, it was risky to pursue development
 haalanki yah bhi ek hakeekat he ki berojgaare kaa mudda utana dab nahin paaya
 This was also not suppressed, because it is not a matter of political parties but of the people
 udhar kisaan andolanon or vipaksh ne kisaan kii badahaali kii baton ko bhi nahin marane diya
 But there is a difference of earth and sky in not letting an issue die and making it the main issue
 baharhaal,chunaav main ek maheene se kam kaa samay bachaa rahane ke baavjood hamen yah nahin pataa chal rahaa he ki is baar chunaav prachaar ke dauraan mukhya mudda kya hoga
 Now there is no time left to speculate
 phir bhi yah hakeekat he ki koi bhi chunaav muddavihin nahin ho saktaa
 This has never happened in any democratic country of the world
 bhale hi phizul ke mudde par chunaav ho jate hon,yaa aise mudadon ko khadaa kar liya jaataa ho,jinhen manovaigyanik aadhaar par saarvkalik or saarvbhaumik mana jaataa he
 For example, the identity of religion and race is an eternal issue
 aajkal isi aadhaar par raashtra or desh kaa aham bhi puri duniya main chunavi mudda banane laga he
 In the long history of wars, my religion, my village, my country has been made an eternal spirit
 lekin duniyabar main iskaa raajnneetik istemaal pichley kai dashakon main itnaa zyada kar liya gaya ki is mudde kaa utana asar ho nahin paata
 War and terrorism are an issue of the same species
 sansanikhej bhi he
 But politically no safe solution to terrorism could be found so far
 lihaaza chunavi mudda banane kii paatrata isamen nahin dikhti
 Maybe, that's why the classic issue like roti cloth and house is not able to be evicted even in the most developed countries nowadays
 'roti,kapadaa or makaan'kaa nayaa rup
 
 
 If we look at the situation, we still could not get rid of poverty completely
 sattar saal main bhale hi halaat sudhare hon,lekin sabake liye khaadya suraksha or sabake liye makaan abhi bahut dur kii baat he
 Anyway, the biggest problem for us has become the widening gap between the poor and the rich
 bilkul nai pravriti dekhen to duniya ke apane sabase bade loktantric desh main samaveshi vikaas sabase badi chunauti he
 Especially then, even today, when we remain a agricultural country and more than half of the country's population, that is, the farmer is going through the worst phase historically
 aise main koi bhi yah atkal laga saktaa he ki is chunaav main mudde ke taur par kisaan ko bedakhal koi bhi nahin kar saktaa
 Unemployment cannot be ignored
 
 
 chunavi raajnneeti main yuvavarg ko sabase bada hissedaar mana jaataa he
 Especially his energy and time play the biggest role in elections
 ham to duniya main is samay yuvaaon kii sabase zyada aabaadi vaale desh hai
 At present 65% of our population is young
 saare ke saare voter bhi hai
 a large part of this class is troubled to the extent of panic due to sudden increased unemployment
 aise main kaise sambhav he ki berojgaare is baar ke chunaav main mudda na bane
 Even if this issue is fatal for the ruling party during elections
 ise chunavi mudda banane se kaise roka ja sakegaa,yah abhi pataa nahin he
 The matter of showing the remaining dreams
 
 
 beshak sapanom main mudde banane kii jabardast kshamta hoti he
 Especially in election slogans
 lekin haal ke daur main iskaa istemaal itnaa khinchaa gaya ki isaki jaan si nikal gai he
 At least this time election cannot be done
 haalanki raajnneetik dalon ke chunavi ghoshnapatron main sapane chhapana sabase aasaan kaam hota he
 Yet there has been a difference between before and today
 yah ki aaj kii duniya main jaagrukta badi he
 Literacy has increased very fast all over the world, which is why in some developed countries recently, dreaming technology has started to fail badly
 vishwa kaa nayaa naagarik yah samajhane laga he ki use jhuthe sapane dikhaae ja rahe hai yaa koi nishtha ke saath vyaavhaarik vaada kar rahaa he
 On this basis, it can be said that there will be newness in the election manifestos of this time
 har samajhadaar raajnneetik dal bade sapane dikhaane se bachegaa
 So in this election, it is very possible that the political parties should put concrete plans and promises in front of the voters
 sattapaksh ko to yah saavdhaanee bahut hi zyada baratani padegi
 In this way, it seems that in this election, there will be a competition to present a practical plan to reduce the misery or crisis of farmers and youth of the country
 khaastaur par maujuuda sarkaar kii bedakhli kii koshish karne vaale vipaksh ke netaaon main yahi hode machegi ki koun sabase zyada vishwasaneey tareeke se apni yojanaayen pesh kar paata he
 Goal management technology has to be used
 
 
 udyog vyapaar jagat main lakshya prabandhan praudyogiki is samay bade asardaar tareeke se istemaal ho rahi he,jabaki lakshya prabandhan praudyogiki kii zarurat raajnneetik kshetra main zyada he
 Now that we have got this technology, what is the harm in using it in this election
 masalan kisaanon or berojgaaron kii samasya dur karne kaa lakshya hasil karne ke liye prabandhan praudyogiki ke ye paanch nukte chunavi ghoshnaaon main daale ja sakate hai
 The first is not to pile up plans and programs
 yani ek-do yojanaon par hi jor ho
 Second, that goal is worth the measure
 yani baad main bataaya ja sake ki jitna kaha gaya tha,vah puraa hua
 Thirdly, that goal should be achieved
 yani baqayada bataaya ja sake,us kaam ko puraa karne ke liye itane paise kii jarurat padegi or ye paise desh ke in in logon se tex ke zariye ugaahe jaaenge
 The fourth thing is reliability
 yani vaisaa kaam apane desh main yaa duniya main or kahin pehle kabhi hua jarur ho
 The public's confidence in new experiments has been lost
 lakshya prabandhan kaa paanchvaan nukta samaybaddhata kaa he
 This time the manifestos will also have to open the account of fulfilling the promises that the futures will be completed in these stages in the next five years
