 The metric method is being used extensively for scientific and technical works
 vartmaan main keval uese, myanmar or liberia ko chhodkar vishwa ke sabhi deshon ne aadhikarik rup se metric pranali ko apana liya he
 The practice of expressing numbers through the ten signs first originated in India
 sanskrit sahitya main ankaganit ko shreshthatam vigyaan mana gaya he
 Numerical nouns were invented by Aryabhata in India in about the fifth century
 dashamik pranali dwaara vibhinn ikaayiyon ke maanon ko nirdhaarit karne main das kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, arthath iske antargat prayek ikai apane se choti ikai kii das guni badi hoti he or apane se thik badi ikai kii dashamansh choti hoti he
 In this way, one, ten, hundred, sahasra etc
 came to be used for measuring numbers
 ganit vishyak vibhinn prashn hal karne ke liye bhartiya vidwaanon ne vargamul, ghanmul or agyaat sankhyaon ko maaloom karne ke dhang nikaale
 The decimal system came into use to express small parts of numbers
 vastuon ke moolyankan main is pranali kaa prayog sarvapratham france kii kranti ke praarambhik dinon main hua tha or kranti ke kuch hi varshon baad desh kii samast maap taul dashamik pranali dwaara hone lagi thi
 Impressed by the ease of this system, many other countries also adopted it
 belgium ne san 1833 or switzaraland ne san 1891 main is pranali ko apanaaya
 Germany, Holland, Russia and America also had a great impact on this system and these countries also adopted this type of system soon
 is pranali ko antarrashtriya manyata pradaan karne ke liye 1870 i
 main francisi sarkaar dwaara ek sammelan bulaayaa gaya, jisamen 30 deshon ke pratinidhiyon ne bhaag liya or is pranali ko antarrashtriya manyata dene kaa suzav sweekaar kiya
 Gradually, this system started being used in almost part of the world
 is pranali kaa sabase bada gun isi sugamawa he
 Its original digit is 10
 prayek maap yaa taul main 10 yaa iske dasven bhaag kaa prayog hota he
 The length measuring unit according to this system is meters
 isi prakaar dravyaman kii ikai kilogram he or drav padaarth ke paimaane kii ikai litre he
 In India, there were many different types of measurement and weighing
 prayek praant or mandi main alag alag dhangon se chijen maapi or tauli jaati thim
 It is estimated that there were more than 150 types of weights and different methods of measurement in the country
 in kathinaaiyon se vastuon kaa adanapradaan tathaa unka sahi bhav maaloom karnaa bada kathin ho jaataa tha
 Due to the variation of the measurement weights, there is not even an accurate estimate of the decreasing prices of the items
 isse vyapaar kii bahut kshati haati he or kreta evam vikreta donon ko shankaa rahati he
 The method of bringing uniformity in the methods of measurement of weights was considered many times in India, but only in September, 1956, the Weights and Measures Model Act was passed
 28 disambar 1956 i
 ko usapar raashtrapati kii sweekruti praapt hone par kendriya sarkaar ko dashamik pranali ke baat or maap chalaane kaa adhikaar praapt hua
 By adopting this system, the government got the right to implement the same type of measurement and weighing methods in the whole country
 isse vyapaar or vastuon ke yatayaat main badi sahaayta mili
 The ease of the decimal system also made it easier to calculate and weigh transactions
 is pranali ko desh main purna rup se prachlit karne ke liye 10 varshon kii avadhi nirdhaarit kii gai thi
 Till this period both the new and old methods continued to work and gradually the use of the new method increased in place of the old method
 7 april 1795 main france main ek kanoon lagu hua jisane maapan main upyog ke liye nimnlikhit paanch ikaiyaan paribhaashit kin- Over time, many forms of the metering system have emerged
 in sabhi main meter or kilogram ko aadharbhoot ikai ke rup main liya gaya
 But in these latter methods, the derived units were defined differently
 metry paddati ke kuch pramukh parivarti rup ye hai- The hard disk operator is a data storage device consisting of hard circular drives that rotate
 ise sanganak main aankadon ke bhandarad ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 a hard disk or hard drive can also mean: panopticon jeremi bentham dwaara 18veen shatabdi main abhikalpit ek prakaar kii sansthanik bhawan he
 The term 'panopticon' is made up of two components: pun and opticon
 pen kaa matlab he kaidi or opticon kaa matlab he kaidiyon par nazar rakhane vaala nigaraneekartta
 a place where prisoners are monitored can only be a prison
 is pad or isse judaa siddhant gadhane kaa shrey angrej darshanik or saamaajik siddhantkaar jeremi bentham ko jaataa he
 He designed its prison blueprint in 1785 as a prison design
 ve ek golakaar imaarat bananaa chaahate the jiske bich main ek unchaa tower banaaya janaa tha
 Between the tower and the boundary walls built some distance around it, there were chambers to house prisoners or lunatics
 bentham kii yojana thi ki in kothriyon main hameshaa roshni rakhi jaae taaki usamen rahane waalon kii gatividhiyon par tower se najar rakhi ja sake
 Bentham intended that prisoners or lunatics should not detect their surveillance
 bentham upyogetavaadi darshan ke pairokaar the or unki manyata thi ki agar jail ko is prakaar banaaya jaae ki usamen band kaidi apane upar nigaraanee rakhane vaale ko dekh hi na saken to nigaraanee kaa kharchar bahut kam ho jayega
 Since the inmates will not know whether they are being monitored or not, the watchdog will not always have to be on duty
 samaaj-vigyaan ke liye panopticon kaa mahatva keval isiilie nahin he
 For him, the idea of panopticon has acquired the status of a metaphor
 francisi chintak mishael phuko ne apni rachana 'disiplin and panish' main bentham kii is avadharana ke istemaal ke jariye dikhaaya ki kis tarah aadhunik samaaj main karagaar hi nahin, balki sena, vidhyalay, aspataal or kaarkaanon jaisi koticram aadhaarit sanrachanaon kaa vikaas aitihaasik rup se panopticon ke tarj par hi hua he
 According to Fuco, modern society wants to enforce discipline, which requires it to monitor every member in every situation
 nigaraanee kii yah prakriya kuch is tarah chalati he jaise ki kuch ho hi na rahaa ho, sab kuch saamaanya ho
 This is the purpose of the Panopticon
 aisi baat nahin ki panopticon ke vichaar main nihit sattakendriyata ke prabal agrahon se bentham bhi aparichit the
 Therefore, he also defined it as an unprecedented method through which one brain can establish its power over another
 ve ise jail ke alaava ek vyapak falak par bhi dakhte the
 He believed that if working under an architecture like Panopticon, people would be able to improve ethically, their health would be fine, industries would be revived, education would be spread, the burden would be reduced on the public, economy would be reduced
 The base will solidify as a rock and the law will be able to be strengthened despite its weaknesses
 is kathan se zaahir he ki bentham ko panopticon se bahut ummiden thim
 Perhaps that's why he spent a lot of his life and a large part of his wealth on efforts to build a prison based on the design of Panopticon
 is chakkar main bentham ko kai tarah kii raajnneetik or vittiya kathinaaiyaan jhelni padin
 In 1811 the British Parliament allowed them to buy a place to erect such a building, but the King of England refused to stamp it
 do saal baad sansad ne bentham ko hui vittiya haani kii bharpai karne ke liye unhen 23,000 pound kaa muawza diya
 On the whole, no jail room could be built during Bentham's lifetime based on his design
 baad main panopticon ke vichaar se prabhavit ho kar britain, america, hungary, spain, argentina, mexico, vietnam, frans, canada, newjiland, austeraliya, cuba or dakshin africa main kai karagaron kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 The buildings of the Wooster State Hospital in England and the Rounds Mill in Derbyshire are also believed to have been built by the Panopticon
 aaj panopticon sthapaty ke rup main faishan se baahar ho chukaa he
 But its importance as a principle of monitoring the society and the citizens has increased continuously
 saahitiyik or saanskrithik nirupanon main panopticon jaisi sanrachanaon kaa zikr hota rahata he
 These include Franz Kafka's famous work The Cassell and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Chronicle of a Death Fortold
 mishael phuko panopticon ke vichaar kaa vistaar karte hue use aadhunik samaaj kii us buniyadi pravriti par lagu karte hue ‘panoptisizam’ kii dharna pesh karte hai jiske tahat maanviya aabaadiyon ko kuch aisi takaton dwaara prabandhit or niyantrit kiya jaataa he jo aksar adrishy rah kar badi safaai or nafaasat se yah kaam anjaam detii hai
 Fuko writes that if there are prisoners living in the Panoptikon, then this method of monitoring them is about any intrigue they have, a collective plan of escape, a future crime or a bad influence on each other
 Will cancel the possibilities
 agar vah imaarat kisi aspataal kii he to nigaraanee ke zariye sankramak rog failane se roka ja saktaa he, agar vah paagalakhaana he to paaglon dwaara ek-duusare ke viruddh hinsa karne kaa khatra khatm kiya ja saktaa he, agar vah skool he to bacchon ko nakal karne, shorgul karne, baaten karne or vakt barbaad karne se roka ja saktaa he
 And, if it is a factory, it can be monitored by the workers, such as dislocation, theft, factionalism, which reduces the level of work or falls or causes accidents
 phuko ke anusaar yah prakriya nigaraanee karne vaale kii nigaranishuda logon par satta kii guarantee karti he, baavjood iske ki nigaranishuda logon ko apane upar satta aropit kiye jane kaa ehsaas nahin hota
 In this sense, the Panopticon takes the form of an automated process
 phuko ke mutabik nigaraanee karne vaala adrishy vyakti bina kisi dikkat ke nigaranishudaaon kii vyavhaar-style se vaakif ho jaataa he
 This trend is not limited to the relationship between the watchdog and the watchdog alone
 ‘panoptic nigaah’ 841 pa main dhaalane kii kshamta honi chahie
 For this, an actor becomes so disrespectful to his supervisors that they assimilate him as a person, to the extent that they can be monitored on their own
 ve apane hi daman or niyantran ke agent ho jate hai
 In his analysis, Fuco comes to the conclusion that not only in liberal democracies is the basis of panopticism, but the capitalist system itself adopts panopticism to continuously increase the rate of growth and profits
 phuko ke anusaar panopticon kii sanrachanaayen isiyat dwaara diye gayi shram sambandhi mulyon, naitiktaaon or kendrikrut praadhikaar ke prati nishtha kii tajaviz karti hai
 In the capitalist system, instead of authority like God, the elite of the economic world get it
 phuko kaa yah vishleshan internet-purv yug kaa he
 But is the formlessness of the digital world of the Internet free of panopticons? Close surveillance of television and videography can easily be termed as a panoptic view, but Slavoj Jizek says that formlessness is found in its purest form in the panopticons that Bentham envisions
 koi nahin jaanata ki us panopticon ke centre main koi he bhi yaa nahin
 If you know that there is someone there, then the horror of the Panopticon will be reduced slightly
 lekin, bentham kii bhashaa main to vah ek ek behad andheri jagah hoti he
 Somebody is chasing, it is more scary to realize that someone is actually chasing
 aisi anischitata behad santraskaari hoti he
 Perhaps Jijek's clear reference here is towards those Internet-related codes under which isps can not only track users and their activities, but also record their functioning

 Traditions in Indian popular cinema are made up of 6 major influences
 pehla; pracheen bhartiya mahakavyon mahabharat or ramayana ne bhartiya cinema ke vichaar or kalpana par gaharaa prabhaav choda he visheshkar kathanak par
 Examples of this effect are the accompanying story, the back story and the technique of story within the story
 In the plot of popular Indian films, the story often spreads to sub-narratives, the plot can be seen in the 1993 film Khalnayak Aur Gardish
 doosraa : pracheen sanskrit naatak, apni shailibaddh swarup or pradarshan par mahatv ke saath sangeet, nrity or bhav bhangima milakar " jeevant kalatmak ikai kaa nirmaan karte hai jahaan nrity or anukaran / swang naatakeey anubhav kaa centre hai"
 Sanskrit plays are also known as Natya
 natya shabd kii utpatti "nrit" shabd mul se hui he jisase sanskrit naatak ke bhavy nrity naatak charitra kaa pataa chalata he jis parampara kaa paalan aaj bhi hindi cinema main ho rahaa he abhinay kii raas vidhi jisaki utpatti pracheen sanskrit naatak ke kaal main hui thi, ek mul gun he jo jo bharitay cinema ko pashchimi cinema se bhinn karata he
 In the Raas Vidhi, the actor exhibits a "sense of empathy" that the viewer feels is in contrast to the Western Stanislavski method where the actor must become the "living awakening avatar" of his character
 " abhinay kii raas paddati lokapriy hindi film abhinayta jaise amitabh bachchan or shahrukh khan or desh bhar main priy film jaise rang de basanti, or antarashtriya str par saraahi gayi satyajit re ke filmo bhi dikhataa he
 Third: The traditional folk Indian theater, which became popular after the fall of Sanskrit drama in the 10th century
 in kshetreey prathaon main bengal kii jatra, uttar pradesh kii ram lila, karnataka kaa yakshagan, andhra pradesh kaa chindu naatakam, or tamilnadu kaa terukkutu he
 Fourth: Parsi theater, which presents realism and fantasy, music and dance, plot and performance, ground dialogue and a mastery of stage performances, all of them together in a dramatic address by Atinatak
 parsi naatakon main bhonda hasya, madhur gane or sangeet, sansanikhej or chakachaundh stage kala hoti he
 "all these effects are evident in the masala films made by filmmakers like Manmohan Desai in the 1970s and 1980s
 iskaa udahaaran hai kuli or haal hi main samikshakon dwaara prashansit rang de basanti 
 Fifth: Hollywood in the 1920s to 1950s when musical films were popular there, though Indian filmmakers differed from their Hollywood counterparts in many ways
 udahaaran ke liye hollywood kii sangitamay film kaa plat adhiktar manoranjan kii duniya main hi hota tha jabaki bhartiya filmkaar lokapriy filmo main fantasy ke tatwon ko badhaate hue geet-sangeet or nrity ko kai paristhitiyon main abhivyakti kaa ek prakritik madhyam kii tarah istemaal karte the
 Mythology, history, fairy tale etc
 along with song and dance is an Indian tradition
 iske atirikt "jahaan hollywood ke filmkaar apni filmo ko nirmit swarup ko chhipaane kii koshish karte hai taaki yathartwaadee kathanak puri tarah se pradhan rahe, bhartiya filmkaar is tathy ko chupaane kii koshish nahin karte kii screen par dikhaaya gaya drishy ek kriti, ek maaya, ek kalpana he
 But he mixed his work with people's daily life in interesting and complex ways
 " ek or prabhaav pashchimi mujeec video hai jinka 1990 ke baad se kaaphi prabhaav padaa he jise nrity kram, camera angel, gati or sangeet meme bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 An early example of this is Mani Ratnam's' Bombay
 lokapriy bhartiya cinema kii tarah bhartiya samaantar cinema par bhi bhartiya theatre or bhartiya sahitya kaa prabhaav padaa he lekin antarrashtriya prerana ke rup main us par european cinema khaas taur par italian navayathartwaad or french kaavyatmak yathartwaad) kaa hollywood ke mukaable zyaada asar padaa he
 Satyajit Ray has called the Italian film filmmaker Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves and French filmmaker John Raynor's The River, an inspiration for his debut film Pather Panchali
 re ne apane aap ko european cinema or bengali sahitya ke alaava bhartiya theatre kii parampara khaas taur par shastreey sanskrit naatak kii raas paddati kaa bhi karzdaar mana he
 In Raas, the characters not only feel emotion but also depict the audience in an artistic form and this is the double depiction seen in the Apu trilogy
 
 bimal roy kii do bigha zamin bhi de sika kii bisical thivs se prerit thi or isane bhartiya nayi lahar kaa maarg prashast kiya jo french nayi lahar or japani nayi lahar kaa samakaleen tha
 Some Indian films of the 1930s are known as "multilingual"
 in filmo ko milti julati lekin asmaan roopaantar main vibhinn bhashaaon main shoot kiya gaya tha
 According to Rajadhyaksha and Willeman in the Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema, a multilingual film in its exact form ek bahubhashi yaa tribhaashi ek prakaar kii film he jo 1930s main studio yug main bani thi, jisame alag bhashaaon main har drishy ke alag lekin samaan shot liye jate the jisame abhinayta alag hote the lekin takaniki karmi or sangeet ek hote the
 : 15 rajdhakshya or villemen ke anusaar apane inacychlopedia ke shodh ke dauraan unhen bahubhashi, dab filmo, rimek ityadi ke bich main bhed karne main kaaphi kathinaayee hui
 In some cases, the same film is listed in another language as a different film with a different title
 kai varshon ke vidvattapurna kaary ke baad hi isamen nirnaayak vivaran nikaala ja saktaa he
 ": 15 asamiya film udyog kii utpatti krantikari kalpanaakar rupakonvar jyotiprasad agarwal ke kaaryon main he, jo ek kavi, naatak lekhak, sangeetkaar or swatantraaa senaanee bhi the

 bahut se vidyut yaa electronic ghatakon yaa avyavon ko jodakar vidyut paripath banate hai
 There are two types of components that can be added to a circuit: hierarchy and parallelogram
 jis paripath main sabhi ghatak shreneekram main jude hon, use shrenee paripath or jis paripath main sabhi ghatak samanaantar kram main jude hon use samanaantar paripath kaha ja saktaa he
 In the series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in the parallel circuit, the same voltage is available on each component
 shrenee paripathon main prayek ghatak kaa karyrat rahanaa aavashyak he, anyathaa paripath tut jaayegaa
 The remaining components will continue to function even if any component in the sequence circuits is defective, but the entire circuit may be short-circuited if any component is short-circuited
 yadi kisi paripath main kisi sthaan par 10 om ke pratirodh kii aavashyaktaa he kintu vah uplabdh nahin he kintu 5-5 om ke do pratirodh sulabh hai to inako shreneekram main jodakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if two resistors of 20–20 ohm are available, adding them in parallel, the equivalent resistance of 10 ohm is obtained
 dedh-do volt sahan kar sakane vaale saikadon balbon ko shreneekram main jodakar 230 volt se gharelu bijli se unako jagamagaaya jaataa he
 If 24 volts are needed somewhere, 24 volts can be obtained by connecting two 12 volt batteries in series
 paripathon main bhinn prakaar ke avyav bhi shreneekram yaa samaantarkram main jude ho sakate hai udhaaharan ke liye diod kii raksha ke liye uske shreneekram main upyukt maan kaa fus laga diya jaataa he; yaa pankhe ko chaalu / band karne ke liye uske shreneekram main ek switch daalaa jaataa he
 In the same way, a diode is inserted in its parallel in order to avoid voltage in the reverse direction in an electrolytic capacitor
 kisi sthaan par 2 ampir dhara vahan kar sakane vaala diod lagaana ho to 1 ampear dhara vahan kar sakane vaale do diod samaantarkram main laga dene se bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 When two or more components of electricity are connected in such a way that the same current flows in them, it is called hierarchy
 arthath, shreneekram main jude sabhi avyavon main prayek kshan ek samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he
 However, the potential difference between the ends of those individual components depends on the electrical properties of those components
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi 10 om, 20 om or 50 om ke teen pratirodhon ko shreneekram main joda gaya ho or 10 om vaale pratirodh main 2 ampiore dhara bah rahi ho to 20 om evam 50 om vaale pratirodhon main bhi 2 ampear dhara pravaahit ho rahi hogi
 But the potential of these three resistors will vary
 samaantar kram main jude do yaa adhik 'do siron vaale' vidyut avyavon main sabhi ke siron ke bich vibhavaantar samaan hota he kintu inamen se hokar bahane vaali dhara alag-alag ho sakati he jo un avyavon ke pratirodh, prerakatv, dharita evam anya baton par nirbhar karti he
 Electric bulbs, fans, tube lights etc

 The second story behind the establishment of Bikaner is that one day Rao was sitting in Jodha's court
 Bikaji came late in the court and bowed and started talking softly in his ear to his uncle Kandhal
 Seeing this, Jodha said sarcastically " That uncle and nephew are planning to conquer a new state "
 is par bika or kandhal ne kahan ki yadi aap kii krupa ho to yahi hoga
 And with this, both uncle and nephew came out of the court and both established the state of Bikaner

 In 1791, during the period of British rule in India, Jonathan Duncan, the representative of the Honourable East India Company proposed the establishment of a Sanskrit collegefor development and preservation of the Sanskrit Vangmaya and to show that the English people were in favor of the development of the Indian culture
 This was sanctioned by Governor General Lord Cornwallis
 Kashi Naresh Mahip Narayan Singh donated a huge tract of land in the southern part of Benares for construction of the college
 The first teacher of this Institution was Pandit Kashinath
 The Governor General initially sanctioned a budget of Rs
 20,000 per annum
 Initially the college offered courses up to graduation
 From 1857, the College started Postgraduate teaching
 The examination system was adopted in 1880
 In 1894 the famous building of Saraswati Bhavan Granthalaya, where thousands of manuscripts are preserved, was constructed, 
 These manuscripts are edited by the Principal of the College and published in book form
 The series of books are known as Sarasvati Bhavana Texts
 More than 400 books have been published in the series

 From 1791 to 1844 the college was governed by the Administrative officers of the city
 Later British officers decided that Indians should also obtain knowledge of European literature and Philosophy
 Therefore they ordered the appointment of a Principal for the college
 The qualification laid down was the Principal must be a scholar of Sanskrit with knowledge of European literature and philosophy
the Principals from 1844 were: aarasi–aa–aado sindhi bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar kala prakaash dwaara rachit ek upanyaas he jiske liye unhen san 1994 main sindhi bhashaa ke liye sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya

 Ayyappan is considered to be an incarnation of the infant Shasta mentioned in the Kamb Ramayana, the Eighth Scandal of the Maha Bhagwat and the Asura Scandal of Skandpuran
 kehete hai, shasta kaa janm mohini veshadhari vishnu or shiv ke samagam se hua tha
 The famous temple of Ayyappan is located in this Dham, situated among 18 hills, known as Punakavan, which is called Sabarimala Sridharmashastha Temple
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki parashuram ne ayppan puja ke liye sabarimala main murti sthapit kii thi
 Some people also associate it with the name of Rambhakta Shabari
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki kareeb 700-800 saal pehle dakshin main shaiva or vaishnavon ke bich vaimnasy kaaphi bad gaya tha
 Mr
 Ayyappan was then envisaged to address those differences
 donon ke samanvay ke liye is dharmatirth ko viksit kiya gaya
 Even today, this temple is considered a symbol of harmony and harmony

 On reaching Pampa, we decided to travel to Sabarimala on foot

 Sri Ayyappan's birth is considered to be on the day of coincidence of Makar Sankranti and Uttara Phalguni Nakshatra, coinciding with Panchami Tithi and Scorpio Lagna
 isiilie makar sankranti ke din bhi dharmashashtha mandir main utsav manaaya jaataa he
 We reached there on the day of Makar Sankranti
 yah mandir sthapaty ke lihaaj se to khubasurat he hi, yahaan ek ajeeb kism kii shanti kaa ahsaas bhi hota he
 Just as it is situated between 18 hills, similarly one has to cross 18 steps to reach the temple courtyard
 mandir main ayppan ke alaava malikapuratt ammaa, ganesh or nagaraja jaise up devataaon kii bhi murtiyon hai
 Ayyappan is anointed with ghee during the festival

 Apart from Makar Sankranti, there is a big celebration on 17th of November

 Apart from these, the doors of the temple remain closed for common visitors throughout the year

 Therefore, there can be small girls here, who are not menstruating or old women, who have become free from it

 The rest, a wonderful example of secularism, is seen at a place called Erumeli, just a few miles from here, as the mausoleum of the Muslim Dharmanuayi Vavar, considered an ally of Mr

 upachaaraarthi kendrit manashchikitsa yaa vyakti-kendrit chikitsa yaa anirdeshaatmak chikitsa maansik upachaar kii ek vidhi he jisamen rogi ko lagaataar sakriy rakhaa jaataa he or bina koi nirdesh die use nirog banane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 In contrast, it is self-preservation in which neither the patient is made dependent on the doctor nor the circumstances before him are interpreted, on the contrary, by indirectly helping the patient to try to mature his cognitive and emotional area so that He could adjust himself to the present and future circumstances
 isamen chikitsak kaa daayitv maatr itnaa hota he ki vah rogi ke liye "swasangrakshan"kii vyavastha kaa uchit prabandh karata rahe kyonki rogi ke samvegatmak kshetra main samaayojan laane ke liye chikitsak kaa sahyog vaanchit hi nahin, aavashyak bhi he
 Nonoperative therapy is very similar to psychoanalysis
 donon main hi chetan-avchetan-str par prastut bhaavana ichchhaaon kii abhivyakti ke liye puri aazaadee rahati he
 The only difference is that in indirect treatment, the patient is kept familiar with the problems of the present, while in psychoanalysis, he is taken towards the memories of the past
 maansik upachaar kii yah vidhi safal rahi he kyonki jaise hi rogi main ek vishisht sujh paidaa hoti he, vah swasth ho jaataa he
 Instructional therapy also has certain drawbacks: kuch vyaktiyon or rogon par iskaa prabhaav nahin hota
 This method is successful only at the higher intellectual level
 vartmaan paristhitiyon se sambhddha samasyaayen hi isse sulajh sakati hai, ateet main viksit manogranthiyon par iskaa prabhaav nahin hota
 Treatment-focused psychiatry is a psychological method of mental illness prevention propounded by Carl Rogers
 rogers kaa swa-vaad prasiddh he jo adhikanshat: upachaar prakriya yaa paristhitiyon se udbhoot pradatton par avlambit he
 Rogers' original fantasies are about self-development, self-knowledge, self-control, familiarity with external and internal experiences, development of understanding, real acceptance of emotions, etc
 vastut: vyakti main vriddhivikas, abhiyojan evam swasthyalabh tathaa swasphoton kii swaabhaavik vritti hoti he
 Mental conflict and emotional excitement inhibit this type of feeling
 in avarodhon kaa nivaaran bhaavon ke prakaashan or unako angikaar karne se sujh ke udai hone se ho jaataa he
 In this method, such an environment is present that the patient remains more and more active
 vah swatantra hokar upachaarak ke sammukh apane bhaavon, ichchhaaon tathaa tanaav sambandhi anubhutiyon kaa abhivyaktikaran kare, uddeshy, prayojan ko samajhe or sangrakshan ke liye duusare par ashrith na rah jaae
 In this, self-preservation or self-sighting is necessary
 upachaarak paroksh rup se, bina hastkshep ke rogi ko vastusthiti kii chetana main keval sahaayta detaa he jisase uske bhavatmak, gyanatmak kshetra main praudhata aae
 He does not instruct, nor does he explain the situation
 is vidhi ke paanch str hai : Assistance of the treatment-seeker: This is the role of active support of the patient
 upachaarak apane haav bhav, rang dhang or baatcheet se prarambh main hi yah spasht kar detaa he ki uske paas rogi kii samasyaon kaa pratyuttar nahin he
 Yes, upon coming in contact, the patient must feel a situation in which he can solve his problems
 bhaavon kii abhivyakti : sahanubhuti kaa vaataavaran paane se rogi ke nishedhaatmak evam virdohi sanvegon kaa, jo abhi tak nichle str par dabe the, pradarshan ho jaataa he
 Similarly, there is also a free release of positive sentiments
 bhaawanaaon kii abhivyakti upachaar kaa ek aavashyak ang he
 Without this, prevention of disease is not possible
 antardrushti kaa abhyuday : ek nai drushti se udai hone se rogi apane vaastavik swa ko usee rup main angikaar karata he tathaa vaastavik swa or adarsh swa main saamanjasy laata he
 Positive Attempts: In this state he makes macro plans and is proactive
 sampark kaa samaapan : is avasthaa main rogi ko kisi prakaar kii sahaayta lene kii aavashyaktaa nahin rah jaati
 He becomes a free thinker and a pioneer
 aatmavishvaas ke udai hone se uski vichaardhaara main parivartan aa jaataa he or vah daayitv kaa anubhav karata he
 He does not need the help of the therapist and 'that is enough' - this feeling rises and becomes firm in him
 yadhyapi upachaaraarthi kendrit manashchikitsa upachaar kii utkrisht vidhi he tathaapi kuch aise maansik rog hai jinpar iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Mostly, this treatment method proves to be highly beneficial when there is mental and general mental debility
 is yukti ke dwaara taatkaalik samasya sahaj hi sulajh jaati he
 This method is mostly successful on those whose intellectual level is high
 nyaayalayik bhashavigyaan yaa nyaay-bhashavigyaan, anuprayukt bhashavigyaan kii ek shakha he jo bhashavaigyanik gyaan, vidhiyon tathaa antardrushti kaa upyog karke nyaalayon main aparaadh-anveshan main sahaayak hota he
 Linguists working in courts use it in the following three areas; bhashavaigyanikon ne nimnlikhit kshetron main sakshya prastut kiye hai- Is a physical element

 aavart sarini main tattvon kii shreniyan Shringar rasa is one of the main juices
 yah rati bhav ko darshata he
 Shringar is mainly divided into two parts in the name of coincidence and vipralambha or disconnection, but some scholars like Dhananjaya etc
 consider the antecedent distinction of Vipralambha as a coincidence-vipralambha-non-preceding condition and the remaining two are known as vipralam and mating
