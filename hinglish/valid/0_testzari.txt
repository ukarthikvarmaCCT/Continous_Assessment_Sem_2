 Strong controversies were generated by the representatives of the aerosol and halocarbon industries on the Roland – Molina hypothesis
 board ke adhyaksh dupont ne kaha kii ozon riktikaran siddhant "ek vigyaan kii katha he

 President of Precision Valve Corporation Robert Abplanalp wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine about Rowland's public statements complaining
 Despite this, most of the core assumptions made by Rowland and Molina were confirmed by laboratory measurements They were given and certified by direct observations in the stratosphere

 However, they were initially rejected by data quality control algorithms as inappropriate; The ozone hole was detected only in satellite data when the raw data was rechecked for evidence of ozone depletion in situ observations
 jab software jhande ke bina lautaa to ozon chhed ko peeche 1976 main dekha gaya tha
 Susan Solomon, an atmospheric chemist in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, reported that the chemical reaction on the polar stratospheric cloud in the cold Antarctic stratosphere has a vast amount of chlorine, albeit local and seasonal increases that lead to ozone

 unnisvin shatabdi ke ant evam beesvin shatabdi ke prarambh main maanav-jivan main dakshata badhaane, barbaadi kam karne, prayogadhaarit vidhiyon kaa upyog karne aadi kii bahut charchaa hui
 Taylorism can be considered a part of them
 audyogic kranti ke praarambhik dinon main, jabaki kaarkaana sanghathan kii koi sthapit paddati mimasha nahin thi, kaarkaana maalik athwa prabandhak prabandh kaary karte hue aane vaali samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karte samay adhikansh vyaktigat nirnyon par hi nirbhar karte the
 This is called the thumb tech rule
 angootha tech niyam apnaane par kaarkaanon kaa prabandh karte samay prabandhak paristhiti ke anusaar kaary kar sakate the lekin unhen praytn evam mul kii paddati kii simaaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 To make their experience unique, it was important to know who does the work and why does it do it? The path to be followed for this was based on the scientific method i
e
 defining the problem, developing alternative solutions, forecasting results, measuring progress and finding results
 is paridrishy main tailor vaigyanik prabandh ke janak ke rup main ubhar kar aae
 He suggested scientific arrangement in place of thumb tech
 unhone maanviya kriyaaon ko chote-chote bhaagon main baanta tathaa yah pataa kiya ki vah ise kam samay evam adhik utpaadakta se kis prakaar se kar saktaa he
 It includes the level tools for commercial actions,
 tailor ke shabdon main Applying the principles of scientific management to Bethlehem Steel Company, in which Taylor himself was employed, increased productivity threefold
 isliye in siddhanton par vichaar karnaa uchit hi hoga
 Taylor took the initiative to apply the scientific method in the field of management
 ham pehle hi prabandh angootha tech niyam kii simaaon kii charchaa kar chuke hai
 Now because all managers will adopt their thumb-rule rules, it is natural that not all will be equally effective
 tailor kaa vishwaas tha ki adhiktam kaaryakshmata main vruddhi keval ek hi sarvottam vidhi thi
 This method can be developed through study and analysis
 is prakaar se viksit paddati ko puure sanghathan main ‘angootha tech niyam’ ke sthaan par lagu karnaa chahie
 The scientific method consisted of investigation through the work study of elementary systems, integration of best practices and development of a level system, which should be adopted throughout the organization
 tailor ke anusaar lohe kii chhadon ko dabbaband gadiyon main ladane kii choti si utpaadan kriya ko bhi vaigyanik dhang se niojit kiya ja saktaa he evam uskaa prabandhan kiya ja saktaa he
 This will result in huge savings in human power and time and waste of goods
 jitani adhik vyavasthit prakriya hogi utani hi adhik bachat hogi
 In the present context, the use of the Internet has brought about astonishing change in internal efficiency and customer satisfaction
 utpaadan kii kaarkaana pranali main prabandhak, maalik evam shramikon ke bich kii kadi hote hai
 Managers are empowered to get the work done by the workers, so you can easily understand that there is always a possibility of those class distinctions ie manager versus labor
 tailor ne paaya ki is takaraav se, shramik, prabandhak athwa kaarkaana maalik kisi ko laabh nahin pahunchaata he
 He emphasized on full cooperation between management and workers
 donon ko samajhnaa chahie ki donon kaa hi mahatva he
 To achieve this position, Taylor called for a complete mental revolution in both managers and workers
 iskaa arth tha ki prabandhak evam shramik donon kii soch main badlaav aana chahie
 If this happens, the labor organizations will not even think of going on strike etc
 yadi company ko laabh hota he to prabandhakon ko chahie ki vah ise karmchaariyon main baante
 Employees also need to work hard for the good of the company and adopt change
 tailor ke anusaar vaigyanik prabandh is drudh vishwaas par aadhaarit he ki donon kaa hit samaan he, karmchaariyon kii samruddhi ke bina prabandhakon kii samruddhi or iske vipareet prabandhakon kii samruddhi ke bina karm shramikon kii samruddhi bhi adhik samay tak nahin rah sakati
 The work culture of the Japanese is a classic example of this situation
 japani companiyon main pitruvatt style kaa prabandh hota he
 Nothing is hidden between the manager and the workers
 shramik yadi hadtaal karte hai to vah kaale bille laga lete hai lekin prabandh kii sahanubhuti praapt karne ke liye saamaanya ghanton se bhi adhik kaary karte hai
 There should be full cooperation in labor and management in place of individualism
 yah sahyog, na ki takaraav ke siddhant kaa vistaar he
 There should be cooperation at the venue of the competition
 donon ko samajhnaa chahie ki donon ko ek duusare kii aavashyaktaa he
 For this it is necessary that if any constructive suggestion comes from the employees, then attention should be paid to it
 yadi unke suzav se laagat main paryaapt kami aati he to unhen iskaa puraskaar milanaa chahie
 They should be involved in the management and whenever any important decision is taken, the workers should be taken in confidence
 iske saath-saath shramikon ko bhi chahie ki vah hadtaal na karen tathaa prabandh se anuchit maang na karen
 In fact, if there will be open communication system and mutual trust, then there will be no need for labor organization
 japani companiyon ke samaan pitruvat style kaa prabandh hoga jisamen niyokta karmchaariyon kii aavashyaktaaon ko dhyaan main rakhega
 According to Taylor, there would be almost equal division of work and responsibility between labor and management
 puure samay prabandh karmchaariyon ke kandhe se kandhaa milakar kaary karegaa
 Will help them, encourage and pave their way
 audyogic kaary kshamta adhikansh rup se karmchaariyon kii yogyataon par nirbhar karti he
 Scientific management also recognizes the development of employees
 vaigyanik tareeke se kaary karne ke parinamswaroop jo shreshthatam paddati viksit kii gai usko seekhney ke liye karmchaariyon kaa prashikshan aavashyak tha
 Taylor's view was that the foundation of efficiency lies in the employee selection process itself
 prayek vyakti kaa chayan vaigyanik reeti se hona chahie
 The work assigned to him should be in accordance with his physical, mental and intellectual abilities
 unki kaaryakshmata main vruddhi ke liye unako aavashyak prashikshan milanaa chahie
 The maximum efficiency and prosperity of both skilled employees will be ensured
 uparokt vivaran se yah spasht he ki tailor vyavsaay ke utpaadan main vaigyanik paddati kaa kattar samarthak tha
 The techniques set by Taylor are based on research work done during her own career / career career
 kaarkaana pranali main forman vah prabandhak hota he, jiske sidhe sarmpak main shramik pratidin aate hai
 In the first chapter of this book you read that the foreman is the lowest level tax manager and the highest class worker
 vah centre bindu hota he jiske chaaron ore puraa utpaadan niyojan, kriyanvayan evam niyantran ghumta he
 Taylor noted improvements in the execution of this role in the factory structure
 vastav main ek achche forman / paryvekshak kii yogyataon kii suchi taiyaar kii lekin paaya ki koi bhi vyakti inako puraa nahin kar sakaa isliye usne aath vyaktiyon ke madhyam se kriyaatmak formanship kaa suzav diya
 Taylor advocated separate planning and implementation
 is avadharana ko kaarkaane ke nimnatam str badha diya gaya
 This is called functional foremanship
 kaarkaana prabandhak ke adheen yojana adhikari evam utpaadan adhikari the
 Four employees were working under the planning officer, whose names are Direction Card Clerk, Program Clerk, Time and Cost Clerk, and Workshop Disciplinary
 yah chaar kramshah karmchaaree, karmchaariyon ke liye nirdesh taiyaar karenge, utpaadan kaa kaarykram taiyaar karenge, samay evam laagat suchi taiyaar karenge evam anushaasan sunishchit karenge
 The employees who will work under the production officer are - ginayak, tolinayak, repair hero and inspector
 ye kramshah kaary samay thik se taiyaar karne, shramikon dwaara mashin upkarnon ko kaary ke yogya rakhane evam kaary kii gunvattta kii jaanch karne ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 Functional foremanship is an extension of the theory of labor division and specialization to the lowest level
 prayek shramik ko utpaadan kaary athwa sambandhit prakriya ke in aath formaina se aadesh lene honge
 Intelligence, education, chaturth, stability, judgment, specialized knowledge, physical efficiency and energy, honesty and good health in the foreman
 kyonki yah sabhi gun kisi ek vyakti main nahin mil sakate isliye tailor ne aath visheshgyon kii team kaa suzav diya
 Each specialist is assigned the task according to his / her own ability
 udhaaharan ke liye, jo takneekee main siddhasth hai, budhimaan hai evam sthir mastishk ke hai unako niyojan kaary saunpa ja saktaa he
 Those who are energetic and in good health can be given the task of execution
 tailor pramapikaran kaa jabardast pakshdhar tha
 According to him, the scientific method should be adopted for analysis of production methods under the Agunta Tech Rule
 sarvshereshth pranali ko pramaap ke vikaas ke liye surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa he tathaa usamen or sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he jise puure sanghathan main upyog main laayaa janaa chahie
 This can be done through work study techniques which include time study, speed study, fatigue study and procedure study which are described further in this chapter
 dhyaan rahe ki vyavsaayik prakriya ke samakaleen takanic punah ejineering, camen evam mile kaa pathar kaabhi lakshya kaary kaa pramapikaran hota tha
 Standardization refers to the standard determination process for each business action
 pramapikaran prakriya, kaccha maal, samay, utpaada, mashinari, kaary paddati athwa kaary-sharton kaa ho saktaa he
 These are standard criteria to be followed during production
 pramapikaran ke uddeshy is prakaar hai- The purpose of simplification is to eliminate wasted varieties, sizes and dimensions, while standardization means to create new varieties in place of existing ones
 sarleekaran main utpaadan kii anaavashyak anekataaon ko samaapt kiya jaataa he
 This saves the cost of labor, machines and equipment
 isamen malrahit yaa kam rakhana, upkarnon kaa sampurna upyog evam aavart main vruddhi sammilit hai
 Most large companies such as Nokia, Toyota, and Microsoft have successfully implemented standardization and simplification
 apane-apane bazaar main inaki baari hissedari se yah spasht he
 Methodology The purpose of the study is to find the best method of doing the work
 kisi kaary ko karne kii kai paddatiyaan hoti hai
 There are several parameters for determining the best route
 kaccha maal praapt karne se lekar taiyaar maal ko graahak tak pahunchaane tak prayek kriya kaary paddati adhyayan ke antargat aati he
 Taylor created the concept of linking multiple verbs together through functional methodological studies
 ford motor company ne is avadharana kaa safaltaapurvak upyog kiya
 Even today, auto companies are adopting it
 is puri prakriya kaa uddeshy utpaadan laagat ko nunatam rakhana evam graahak ko adhiktam gunvattta evam santushti pradaan karnaa he
 Many techniques are used for this, such as process charts and operational research etc
 ek car kaa dizin taiyaar karne ke liye samuchy rekha kaa arth he parichaalan kriyaaon, karmchaariyon kaa sthaan, mashin evam kaccha maal aadi kaa kram nirdhaarit karnaa
 This is all part of some methodological study
 gati adhyayan main vibhinn mudraon kii gati, jo kisi vishesh prakaar ke kaary ko karne ke liye kii jaati he, kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he jaisaa ki uthaanaa, rakhana, baithna yaa phir sthaan badalanaa aadi
 Unnecessary efforts are eliminated so that the work takes less time to complete properly
 udhaaharan ke liye, tailor evam uskaa sahyogi frank gilberth eent banane kii cheshtaaon ko 18 se 5 tak gata laae
 Taylor demonstrated that by adopting this process, productivity increased fourfold
 yadi sharir kii mudraon kaa baariki se adhyayan kiya jaae to pataa lagegaa ki- Taylor used stopwatches, various symbols and colors to identify different postures, with the help of motion studies Taylor was able to design tools that were suitable for educating workers on their use
 iske jo parinaam nikle vah vastav main adbhut the
 This standard determines the time to complete a well-defined task
 kaary ke prayek ghatak ke liye samay maapan vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 By measuring several times the standard time of the entire work is determined
 samay adhyayan kii paddati kaary kii maatr evam barambharataa, parichaalan kii samay chakra evam samay maapan kii laagat par nirbhar karegi
 The purpose of time study is to determine the number of personnel, to prepare suitable motivational schemes and to determine the labor cost
 udhaaharan ke liye baar-baar ke avlokan se yah tay kiya gaya ki ek card board ke bakse ko taiyaar karne ke liye ek karmchaaree kaa maanak samay 20 minute he
 In this way he will prepare three boxes in one hour
 yah maanakar chalate hai ki ek shramik ek pari main 8 ghante kaary karata he
 Out of which one hour takes out lunch and rest
 is prakaar se teen bakse prati ghante kii dar se saat ghante ke kaary main vah ikkis bakse taiyaar karegaa
 Now this is the standard work of a worker
 iske anusaar mazdooree kaa nirdhaaran kiya jayega
 Any person will start feeling physically and mentally tired while working
 samay-samay par aaraam milane par vyakti aantarik bal punah praapt kar legaa tathaa purv kshamta se kaary kar sakegaa
 This will increase productivity
 thakaan adhyayan kisi kaary ko puraa karne ke liye aaraam ke antaraal kii avadhi evam barambharataa kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 For example, a plant normally operates in three shifts at an eight-hour shift
 yadi kaary ek pari main ho rahaa he to shramik ko bhojan aadi ke liye kuch aaraam kaa samay dena hoga
 If the work is heavy manual labor, the laborer will have to give a short period of rest
 jisase ki uski urja kii kshatipurti ho jaae or vah apana adhiktam yogadan de sake
 There can be many reasons for fatigue such as long working hours, inappropriate work, lack of pleasantness in relationship with your officer or poor working conditions etc
 achche kaary nishpaadan main aane vaali adchanon ko dur kar dena chahie
 Taylor was a strong advocate of the differential remuneration system
 vah kushal evam akushal karigar main antar karnaa chahta tha
 The standard duration and other criteria should be determined based on the work-study described above
 kaarigaron ko in pramaapon ke aadhaar par kushal evam akushal virgon main baanta ja saktaa he
 He wanted skilled employees to get reward
 isliye usne pramaapit kaaryon ko puraa karne ke liye bhinn tathaa pramaapit se kam karne par bhinn mazdooree dar prarambh kii
 For example, it was determined that the standard production per capita is 10 units per day and those who will achieve or exceed this standard will get wages from Rs 50 per unit while those working below it will get wages from Rs 40 per unit
 
 is prakaar se ek kushal karmchaaree ko 11×50 = 550 rupye pratidin bhugtan milegaa jabaki akushal karmchaaree, jisane ikai taiyaar kii he, ko 9 ×40 = 360 rupye pratidin milegaa
 According to Taylor, a difference of 190 rupees is sufficient motivator for an unskilled employee to do the work more optimally
 apane swayan ke anubhav se tailor ne "biupacap" naam ke karmchaaree kaa udhaaharan diya he jo bathleham steel main kaary karata tha
 He, working according to the techniques of scientific management, increased the loading of cast iron in box-car from 12-5 tons per person per day to 47 tons per day, increasing the income from $ 1-15 to $ 1-85
 Increased by 60 percent
 vaigyanik prabandh kii takneekon par ek baar phir se nigaah daalana mahatvapurn hoga kyonki yah kaarykushalta, tailor ke sabhi tareekon ko ekikrut kar sampoornataa liye hue he
 One of the best method to find efficiency is to search and the method chosen helps in determining the proper work of the day
 jo din ke uchit kaary ko puraa kar lete hai athwa usase bhi adhik kar lete hai unako dusron se alag se maanane ke liye kshatipurti kii pranali honi chahie
 This differential method should be based on the assumption that efficiency is the result of the joint efforts of both managers and workers
 isliye unhen aadhiky main hissedari par vivaad nahin karnaa chahie balki utpaadan ko simit rakhane ke sthaan par usamen vruddhi karne ke liye parsparik sahyog karnaa chahie
 It is clear that the essence of Taylor's ideas is not in the separate description of the techniques and theories of scientific management, but in the transformation of mental perception which is called 'mental revolution'
 maansik kranti karmchaaree evam prabandh ke ek duusare ke prati vyavhaar main parivartan ko kehete hai arthath pratiyogita ke sthaan par sahyog
 Both should understand that they need each other
 The goal of both should be to increase the excess
 isse kisi bhi prakaar ke andolan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi
 The management should share some part of the excess among the employees
 karmchaariyon ko bhi apni puri shakti lagaani chahie jisase ki company adhikadhik laabh kamayen
 This approach will be in the interest of both the party and the company
 deergh kaal main karmchaariyon kii bhalaai hi vyavsaay kii samruddhi ko sunishchit karegi
 We can also examine the current state of scientific management
 vartmaan yug main vaigyanik prabandh ke kram main kai nayi takneekon kaa vikaas kiya gaya he
 Operational research was developed for maximum deployment of munitions
 isi prakaar se tailor ne kramik sangyojan kii khoj kii jiskaa ford motor company ne jansadharan ke liye ‘model tii’ ke vinirmaan main safaltaapurvak prayog kiya
 This concept is now being used a lot
 vaigyanik prabandh main ekadam nayaa vikaas vinirmaan he
 Nowadays robots and computers are being used in production and other commercial activities
 in kriyaaon kaa yah vaigyanik prabandh swaroop he
 This has increased the production level
 parichaalan anusandhan ke takneekon kaa vikaas kiya gaya he tathaa vaigyanik prabandh ke kaaran inkaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 Veteran care refers to the fulfillment of special needs that are required in old age
 is shabd main sahaayak jivan, vayask din kii dekharekh, lambe samay kii dekharekh, nursing home, coma kii dekharekh or gharelu dekharekh shaamil hai
 Facilities are different for older people in different countries of the world
 bharat or kai deshon kii jansankhya kaa bada hissaa 60 varsh se upar kii aayu kaa he
 If a person fails to live a healthy and independent life during this age and his family does not provide sufficient personal and financial support, he may need the help of society and government
 north dakota uttari sanyukt rajya america main rajya he
 It was admitted as the 39th state in 1889
 iskaa ilaaka great plane naamak maidani kshetra main padataa he or ise france se 1803 main kharida gaya tha
 It is bordered on the north by the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, on the east by Minnesota, on the south by South Dakota, and on the west by Montana
 kshetra ke hisaab se north dakota kaa america rajyon main 19waan sthaan he
 According to 2016 estimates, the state has a population of only 7,57,952 making it 47th
 bismark rajya kii rajdhani he
 a country's foreign policy, also called the policy of foreign relations, is a set of self-styled strategies chosen by the state to protect its national interests and to achieve its goals in an environment of international relations
 kisi desh kii videsh niti duusare deshon ke saath aarthik, rajnatik, saamaajik tathaa sainik vishyon par paalan kii jane vaali nitiyon kaa ek samucchy he
 Due to the increasing level of globalization and increasing international activity, states will now have to interact with non-state actors
 kisi bhi desh kii videsh niti mukhya rup se kuch siddhanton, hiton evam uddeshyon kaa samooh hota he jinke madhyam se vah rajya duusare rashtron ke saath sambandh sthapit karke un siddhanton kii purti hetu karyrat rahata he
 Similarly, each state has its own foreign policy through which they represent their relations at the international level
 vishesh rup se sarvapratham modelski ne isko paribhaashit karte hue kaha tha ki videsh niti samudaayon dwaara viksit un kriyaaon kii vyavastha he jiske dwaara ek rajya duusare rajyon ke vyavhaar ko badalane tathaa unki gatividhiyon ko anterrashtriya vaataavaran main dhaalane kii koshish karata he
 But this type of definition of foreign policy will be considered as over simplification because the objective of foreign policy cannot be merely change of behavior of others
 apitu iske madhyam se duusare rajyon kii gatividhiyon kaa niyantran karnaa bhi ati aavashyak hota he
 Thus, along with changes in foreign policy, there is a need for continuity at times
 kyonki videshi niti parivartan evam yathasthiti donon prakaar kii nitiyon kaa samanvay hota he
 Rather, Felimus Grass goes a step further when he says that sometimes there is no relation with any state or no definite policy about it is also called foreign policy
 is prakaar videsh niti ke sakaaratmak evam nakaaratmak donon pahalu hote he
 It occurs positively when it attempts to treat other states and negatively when it tries to change the behavior of other states
 atah videsh niti un siddhanton, hito va uddeshyon ke prati vachanabaddhata he jinke dwaara ek rajya duusare rajyon ke saath antarrashtriya sandarbh main apane sambandhon kaa nirvaah karata he
 In this context, along with deciding on foreign policy, it also becomes very important to carry out relations with other states
 lekin is prakaar ke vyavhaar ke samay rajya ko apane laabh-haani arthath sansaadhan evam jokhim donon kaa moolyankan bhi kar lenaa chahie
 An important point in this context is that there is a deep connection between foreign policy and national interests
 rashtrahit vibhinn sandarbho main videsh niti hetu aavashyak bhoomika nibhaate hai- pratham, ye videsh niti ko anterrashtriya vaataavaran ke sandarbh main saamaanya abhivinyas pradaan karte he
 Second, they provide an alternative to the norms governing foreign policy in the near future
 tritiy, rashtriya hit videsh niti ko nirantarata pradaan karte hai
 Fourth, on the basis of these, foreign policy may be able to mold itself in the changing international form
 pancham, rashtriya hit videsh niti ko majboot aadhaar pradaan karte hai kyonki ye samaaj ke samanvit evam sarvasammati par aadhaarit mulyon kii abhivyakti hote hai
 Ultimately, they act as guidelines for foreign policy
 mongolon kaa gupt itihaas mongol bhashaa kii sabase puraani sahitya kriti he jo aadhunik kaal tak uplabdh he
 After Genghis Khan's death in 1227, it was written by an unknown author to the Mongol royal family

 These copies, based in Chinese script, were created by the Ming dynasty in the 14th century by translating from the Mongol script as 'the Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty'
 'gupt itihaas' changez khan ke jivan kaa sabase ahm mongol-krit bakhaan mana jaataa he
 From the perspective of linguistics, it is also a good source for studying the old Mongol language

 kii ek lokapriy hindu bhakthi rachana he, jo sanskrit main likhi gayi he, tathaa ise likhane kaa shrey aadi shankaracharya ko he
 This composition underlines that devotion to God is a very important part of general spirituality, which has been supported by Bhakti Yoga and Bhakti movement

 And as Chakravarti Rajagopalachari has written in his commentary, when intelligence matures and takes root in the heart, it becomes wisdom
 jab vah pragna jivan ke saath sanyukt hoti he tathaa kriya kaa rup le leti he tab bhakthi ban jaati he
 Knowledge that matures is called devotion

 haalanki, in lakshanon main se kai anya sthitiyon ke kaaran ho sakate hai, or kidney cancer vaale vyakti main vishesh rup se beemaari ke shuruaati charnon main koi lakshan yaa kaaran nahin ho sakate hai
 Stage 1 kidney cancer stage 2 kidney cancer Stage 3 kidney cancer stage 4 kidney cancer For stage 4 kidney cancer, the most common sites for kidney cancer metastasis are the lungs, bones, liver, brain, and distant lymph nodes
 gurde ke cancer ke khatre ko badaye jane vaale kaarak main dhumrapaan shaamil he, jo rog ke jokhim ko doharaa sakate hai; iibiprophen or neporosen jaise nsaids kaa niyamit upyog, jo 51% or ucch raktchaap, jisaki jaanch kii ja rahi hai

 Kidney cancer has its origins in two major places: renal tubules and renal inflammation Most cancers in the renal cancers are renal cell carcinomas and clear cell adenocarcinomas
 gurde kii sujan main adhikansh cancer sankramanakalin koshika carcinoma hai
 Treatment for kidney cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease
 surgery sabase aam upachaar he kyonki gurde ke cancer se aksar chemotherapy or radiotherapy kaa jawaab nahin hota he
 Surgical complication can be estimated by renal nephrometry scoring system
 yadi cancer failata nahin he, to yah aam taur par surgery dwaara hataa diya jayega
 In some cases it is associated with the removal of the entire kidney, although most tumors are responsible for partial removal to terminate the tumor and preserve the remaining normal portion of the kidney
 surgery hameshaa sambhav nahin he - udhaaharan ke liye rogi ko anya chikitsa sharton se rokna pad saktaa he, yaa cancer sharir ke chaaron ore fail saktaa he or doctor ise hataane main sakasham nahin ho sakate hai
 There is currently no evidence that body-wide medical treatment after surgery where there is no known residual disease is an adjuvant, helping to improve survival in kidney cancer
 yadi cancer kaa ilaaj surgery ke saath nahin kiya ja saktaa he, jaise ki tumor thanda karnaa yaa ise ucch taapmaana ke saath ilaaj karnaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 However, they are not yet used as standard treatment for kidney cancer

 In establishing the second line, nivolumab demonstrated an overall survival benefit in advanced clear renal cell carcinoma over aliens ever in 2015 and was approved by the FDA
 
 cabozantinib ne kabhi bhi sololimus par ek samgr uttarjivita laabh kaa pradarshan kiya or 2016 main epad dwaara duusari line upachaar ke rup main sweekrut kiya gaya
 Lenavitinib, in combination with lonelimus, was approved in 2016 for patients who had an earlier line of angiogenic therapy
 wilms ke tumor main, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery sweekaar kiye jate hai upachaar, rog ke str par nirbhar hone par iskaa nidaan kiya jaataa he
 Most kidney cancers found in children are of Wilms' tumor type
 These tumors can begin to grow when a fetus is still developing in the uterus, and cannot cause problems until the child is a few years old
 wilms tumor 5 varsh se kam umr ke bacchon main sabase aam he, lekin shaayad hi kabhi bade bacchon yaa vayaskon main nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 It is still unclear what causes most Wilms' tumors? The most common symptoms are inflammation of the stomach and blood in the urine
 gurde ke cancer ke lagbhag 208,500 nae maamalon kaa nidaan duniya main har saal hota he, jo ki sabhi cancer ke 2% se kam he

 sanyukt rajya america ke enech ne anumaan lagaaya he ki 2013 main gurde ke cancer ke lagbhag 64,770 nae maamle or 13,570 logon kii maut hui he
 The incidence of kidney cancer is also increasing in the United States
 yah ek vaastavik vruddhi mana jaataa he, na keval rog ke nidaan ke tareeke main parivartan ke kaaran
 Recent estimates of the incidence of kidney cancer suggest that 63,300 new cases will occur each year in the European Union
 europe main, sabhi cancer ke maamalon main lagbhag 3% kidney cancer hota he
 Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the UK, and it is the fourteenth most common cause of cancer death

 Hearing many exaggerated things about Shri Goswami ji in Mathura and having an attitude like taking his exam, one day Chhitswami reached Gokul with his two-four colleagues, who have been called goons in the "talks" and sitting alone with the fellow and lost money
 And took some coconuts to where Goswami Vitthalnath ji was talking with his eldest son Giridhar ji about intercourse

 After that, after taking him to his revered Bhagavadvigraha, recite Namamantra to him

 himalay parvatashrinkhalaaon ke dakshinvarti bhubhag main kashmir ke purv se lekar nepal tak pahari bhashaayen boli jaati hai
 Grierson considered an independent community of Pahari languages while classifying modern Indian Aryan languages
 chatterjee ne inhen pashachi, darad athwa khas praakrit par aadhaarit maanakar madhyaka main inpar rajasthan kii praakrit evam apbhransh bhashaaon kaa prabhaav ghoshit kiya he
 According to a new opinion, the origin of at least Middle Pahari languages is Shaurseni Prakrit, which is also the origin of Rajasthani
 pahari bhashaaon ke shabdasmooh, dhvanisamooh, vyakaran aadi par anek jaateey staron kii chhap padi he
 Linguistic features of different castes like Yaksha, Kinnar, Kirat, Nag, Khas, Shaka, Arya etc
 can be discovered by trying, in which now the arya-aryan elements are mixed here
 aitihaasik drushti se aisa vidit hota he ki pracheen kaal main inkaa kuch pruthak swaroop adhikansh maukhik tha
 In the medieval period, this area came in more contact with the Rajasthani language speakers and due to the convenience of movement in modern times, Hindi linguistic elements are entering here
 pahari bhashaaon kaa vyavhaar ek prakaar se gharelu bolchaal, patravyavhaar aadi tak hi simit ho chalaa he
 Pahari languages have some phonetic features of the coarse languages such as Ghosha Mahapraan being replaced by a very low-sounding sound
 pashchimi tathaa madhya pahari pradesh kaa naam pracheen kaal main sampadalaksh tha
 Gurjars and other Rajput people continued to visit here during the medieval period, mainly because of the Muslim invasion
 at: sthaneey bhashaprayogon main jo adhikansh "na" ke sthaan par "na" tathaa acarant shabdon kii okarant pravriti lakshith hoti he, vah rajasthani prabhaav kaa dyotak he
 Eastern Hindi also has multiple trends in the Middle Pahari languages because the Katyura dynasty here belonged to the king of Suryavanshi Ayodhya
 is aadhaar par pahari bhashaaon kaa sambandh ardh-magadhi-kshetra ke saath bhi spasht ho jaataa he
 Considering their present form, two elements mainly emerge
 ek to yah ki pahari bhashaaon kii ekaadhik visheshta inhen hindi bhashaa se bhinn karti hai
 Some other elements are similar to both
 kahin to hindi shabd sthaneey shabdon ke saath vaikalpik rup se prayukt hote hai or kahin hindi shabd hi sthaneey shabdon kaa sthaan grahan karte ja rahe hai
 Some foreign words, such as "shaving", "hospital", "lace", "oyster", "doggar", etc
 have also been introduced through the Khadi dialect
 pahari bhashaaon ke teen bhed nirdhaarit kiye ja sakate hai : It is also called Nepali or "khaskura"
 "gorkhali" isi ke antargat he
 There is enough written literature in it
 ye kumaun evam gadhwal main boli jaati hai at: isi aadhaar par "kumaunni" tathaa "gadhwali" ke naam se prasiddh hai
 Their areas are the seven Parvatya districts of Uttar Pradesh and their number of speakers is about 16 lakhs
 kumaunni bhashaa jila nainital, almoda tathaa pithauragarh main prayukt hoti he
 Its area is presently about 8000 square miles and according to the census of 1951, its number of speakers is about 570,008
 hindi dwitiya bhashaa ke rup main prayukt hoti he
 Due to this, Kumaoni has come very close to the Hindi Khadi dialect
 vyakaran kii drushti se sarvanaamon main - mai, tu, ham, tum, uu, uun, kaa prayog chalata he
 The plural form of affinity is "uner" rather than "them"
 hindi kii bhanti kumaunni main do hi ling prayukt hote hai or yah lingatv keval purushatv, stritv ke bhed par aadhaarit nahin pratyut vastu ke aakaar tathaa swabhaav par bhi nirbhar he
 There are two words, and almost all the metals of Hindi are found
 padakram, evam vaakyavinyas bhi miltaa julata he
 In the beginning the subject is the verb at the end
 kriyavisheshan bhi hindi kii bhanti kriya ke purv aata he
 Nevertheless, some sounds in Kumaoni are distinctly different from those of Khadi Boli Hindi
 swaron kii drushti se hrasv "aa", hrasv "e", hrasv "i", hrasv "o" tathaa hvasv "ou" dhvaniyaan dekhi ja sakati hai
 This distinction has made a difference of semantics
 jaise, "kaanv" shabd kaa kumaunni main arth hai - "kaala" or "kaav" shabd kaa arth hota he "kaal" - arthath mrityu
 Special "N" and special "L" are available in dishes
 "kan", "bhaan" jaise shabdon main vishisht "na" dhwani he jiskaa uccharan kuch talvya kii ore jhukaa hua he
 The special "L" letter is found in the dialects of Gangoli and Kali Kumaon
 kumaunni kii aath boliyaan hai - khasrajia, kumyyan, pachhaayi, danpuria, sormali, sheerali, gangola, bhotiya
 The script of the Kumaoni language is Devanagari

 Ancient elements in Garhwali language are still safer than Kumaoni

 This area is about 10,000 sq
 m and the number of Garhwali speakers is about 1 million

 Therefore, characteristics have emerged in linguistic experiments of people living on both sides of the mountains or across the same river
 uttar kii boliyon main tibeti, tathaa purv kii ore kumaunni prabhaav spasht hota gaya he kyonki in kshetron kii seemayen mili hui hai
 Being the residence of Rajput castes, Garhwali has an unrestrained influence on it, and its dialect standing towards the south-west is also making its impact
 gadhwali bhashaa kii kuch visheshtaayen drashtavy hai
 Its inclination is towards elongation, hence the sounds of A, Ai, O, and Au, which have a long form predominant, are used more in vowels
 anunasikta kii pravriti apekshaakrit kam hai
 There are some words which have come from ancient languages like the word "gichko" in the meaning of "mouth"
 sambhav he inamen anek praapt shabd pracheenatam jatiyon ke avshesh hon
 Grammatically, a gargantuan "L" sound is found in Garhwali, which is not found elsewhere
 kriya roopon main dhaatu ke antim "a" kaa lop karke "o" yaa "awa" joda jaataa he, jaise daudna
 Gender discrimination is also not regular
 vastuon kii laghutaa, guruta par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Many words have the same singular, plural form
 uccharan main murdhanya "l" or "na" kii visheshtaayen drashtavy hai
 Garhwali has nine main dialects from localities - Srinagariya, Salani, Manjhakumaiyan, Gangwariya, Badhani, Rathi, Dasoulia, Lobhiya and Rarvalati

 The oral literature of Garhwali language is also important

 In fact, it is the collective name of many dialects
 ye boliyaan jonsar baawar, shimla, uttar-purvi-seemaant punjab, kullu ghati, chamba aadi sthanon main boli jaati hai
 The literature of all these dialects is not received in writing, due to which the scientific discovery of language has been very less
 abhi tak jo boliyaan iske antargat nishchit kii ja saki hai, unka kshetravistaar lagbhag 14 hajaar vargamil kaa he tathaa balanevaale praaia: 16 lakh hai
 The main among them are - Sirmauri, Jaunsari, Kului, Champali, Andiali and Bhadrawahi, etc
 in boliyon main adhikansh loakgeet or kathaayen vishesh prachlit hai
 Some work has been done here on Kului and Chambali
 kului kaa kshetra, bahut sambhav he, pracheen kunind jal kaa kshetra rahaa ho jisane yahan rajya kiya tha
 Presently this dialect is spoken from Kullu Valley to Mahasu district of Himachal Pradesh

 He was born in 1835 in a small princely dynasty called Khandapada near Puri

 Along with Oriya literature, he received higher education in Sanskrit grammar, poetry and literature
 inke pita ne, jo swayan achche vidwaan the, inhen jyotish kaa gyaan karaayaa
 He had no knowledge of languages other than Oriya and Sanskrit, and neither were the printed books available at that time, but the lore of planets, constellations and stars attracted him
 falat: tadpatron par hastlikhit, ganit jyotish ke pracheen siddhant granthon kaa inhone adhyayan aarambh kiya
 He was surprised to see that there was a big difference between what he saw from the statements and inspection of these texts

 According to the belief of many historians and local people, Jammu was founded by King Jambulochan in the 14th century BC
 i named it Jambupura which later deteriorated to Jammu
 raay jambulochan raja bahulochan kaa chota bhai tha
 In Bahulochan, Bahu Fort was built on the banks of river Tavi and Jambulochan settled the city of Jambupura
 raja ek baar akhet karte hue tavi nadi ke tat par ek sthaan par pahunchaa jahaan usne dekha ki ek sher va bakrii ek saath ek hi ghat par pani pi rahe hai
 Both animals went their own way after drinking water
 raja aashcharyachakit rah gaya or akhet kaa vichaar chhodkar apane saathiyon ke paas pahunchaa va sari katha vistaar se bataayi
 Everyone said that this place will be full of peace and harmony where lion and goat are drinking water together
 tab usne aadesh diya ki is sthaan par ek kile kaa nirmaan kiya jaye va uske nikat hi shahar basaaya jaye
 The name of the city was called Jambupura or Jambunagar and later became Jammu
 aaj bhi yahaan bahu kaa kila ek aitihaasik evam darshneey sthal he
 The name of the city is also mentioned in the Mahabharata
 jammu shahar se 32 kilometre duurastha akhnur main puratetvik khudaai ke baad is jammu nagar ke hadappa sabhyataa ke ek bhaag hone ke sakshya bhi mili hai

 The mention of Jammu is also found in the records of the conquests of Timur
 is kshetra ne sikhon evam mughalon ke akramanon ke saath ek baar phir se shakti-parivartan dekha or antatah british raaj kaa niyantran ho gaya
 Here the Deva dynasty ruled from 840 AD to 1860 AD
 tab nagar anya bhartiya nagaron se alag-thalag pad gaya or unase pichad gaya tha
 After that the Dogra rulers came and the city of Jammu regained its lost aura and pride
 unhone yahaan bade bade mandiron va tirthon kaa nirmaan kiya va puraane sthanon kaa jirnoddhar karavaaya, saath hi kai shaikshik santhaan bhi banawaaye
 The city progressed a lot during that period
 dogra shasakon se jammu kaa shashan 19veen shatabdi main maharaja ranjit singh ji ke niyantran main aayaa or is prakaar jammu sikh samrajya kaa bhaag bana
 Maharaja Ranjit Singh appointed Gulab Singh as the ruler of Jammu
 kintu ye shashan adhik samay nahin chal paaya or maharaja ranjit singh ke dehant ke baad hi sikh samrajya kamjor pad gaya or maharaja dalip singh ke shashan ke baad hi british sena ke adhikaar main aa gaya or dalip singh ko company ke aadeshaanusaar england le jaaya gaya
 But at that time the British Raj did not have enough resources to fight in the mountains due to the right to control many parts of Punjab
 atah unhone maharaja gulab singh ko sutluj nadi ke uttari kshetra kaa sabase shaktimaan shaasha maanate hue jammu or kashmir kaa shaasha maan liya
 But in return he took 75 lakh cash from Maharaj
 yah nagad bhugtan maharaja ke sikh samrajya ke purv jagirdaar rahe hone ke kaaran vaid mana gaya or is sandhi ke dayittvon main bhi aata tha
 Thus Maharaja Gulab Singh is revered as the founder of Jammu and Kashmir

 ongenpiyo ke smarak kii khudaai nahin kii gai he
 The main protagonist, Beowulf, the protagonist of the Gates, arrives to assist Hrothgar, the King of the Danes, whose great hall Heorot is destroyed by the demon Grendel
 biovulf jaadui talwaar kii sahaayta se grandal or grandal kii maan donon ko martha he
 Later in his life, when Beowulf becomes king of the Gates, a dragon begins to terrorize his territory, whose treasure was stolen from his burial mound
 vah apni sena ke saath dregon par akraman karata he, lekin use safalataa nahin milti he
 Beowulf decides to follow Ardragon to his den at Ahernaness, but is only dared to accompany him to the young Swedish relative Wiglaf
 biovulf antat dregon ko maar detaa he, lekin gambhir rup se ghayal ho jaataa he
 He is buried in a tumulus by the sea
 biovulf ko ek puranic mahakavy ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jiskaa mukhya paatr ek nayak he, jo divya shaktiyon se paripurna rakshason or jaanwaron se ladane ke liye lambii duriyon kii yatraaen karata he
 The poem also begins with the Medias race, or in general, "in the middle", which is characteristic of ancient epics
 haalanki kavita biovulf aagaman ke saath shuru hoti he, lekin grandal ke hamalen kuch samay tak jari rahete hai
 The poet who composed Beowulf, while telling the story, has focused on using a certain style to maintain excitement and courage within the story
 paatro or unke vansh kaa vistrut itihaas, saath hi ek duusare ke saath unki mulakaaton, unke kaaryon kii sarrathkata unki veerta ke karm aadi kaa varnan uttam rup main kiya gaya he
 Jane Chance wrote in her 1980 article "the Starkural Unity of Beowulf: The Problem of Grandmothers Mother" that the poem makes two standard interpretations: the first side suggests a two-part structure and the second side, a three-part structure Suggests that
 chance ne kaha he ki, "do-bhaag vaali sanrachana kaa paksh british academy 22 kii kaarywahi ke je

 Beowulf begins with the story of King Harugar, who built the great hall Heorot for his people
 isamen, uski patni velhpiyo or uske yoddha naach gaakar khushiyaan manaakar samay vyateet karte hai, jab tak ki naach gane se naaraaz hokar samaaj se baahar kii prajati grandal, haul par hamalaa karti he or harugar ke kai yoddhaon ko sote samay hatya kar detii he or unka bhakshan kar leti he
 But Grendel does not dare to touch the throne of Harugar, as he is told that powerful gods are protected by Harugar
 harugar or uske log, grandal ke hamalon ke khilaaf asahaay hokar, hioroot kaa parityag karne ke bare main sochane lagate hai
 Beowulf, the young warrior of Getland, learns of Harugar's condition and, after getting permission from his king, leaves his homeland and goes to help Harugar
 biovulf or uske sainik hioroot main raat bitaate hai
 When they go to sleep, Grendel enters the hall and attacks and devours one of Beowulf's men
 biovulf, jiske paas koi hathiyaar nahin tha, jo ki nihathe jaanavar par ek anuchit laabh tha, sone kaa abhinay kar rahaa tha or grandal chalaang lagaakar use apane haath main jakad leti he
 The two start fighting
 biovulf ke anuyaayi apane talwaar lekar hamalaa karte hai, lekin unke hathiyaar grandal kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin kar pate hai
 Eventually, Beowulf breaks his hand from Grendel's body with his shoulder, and Grendel tears up and runs away to his home in a dying state
 agali raat, grandal ke maut kaa jashn manaane ke baad, harugar or uske log hiorut main sone lagate hai
 Grendel's mother appears and attacks Hall
 vah harugar ke sabase vishwaasapaarthi yoddha, ashechar, ko grandal kii maut kaa badla lete hue maar daalati he
 Hroगरgar, Beowulf and their soldiers find Grendel's mother in her lair inside the lake
 biovulf khud ko ladaai ke liye taiyaar karata he, yoddha anfarth, use talwaar haranting detaa he
 After getting Harugar to pledge for several conditions for his posthumous death, Beowulf jumps into the lake
 grandal kii maa use jald hi dekh leti he or usapar hamalaa bol detii he
 However, she is not able to harm Beowulf through her weapon, dragging him to the bottom of the lake
 gupha main grandal kaa sharir or do aadamiyon kii laashen rakhi hui hai, grandal kii maa or biovulf ke bich bheeshan ladaai chal rahi hai
 At first, Grendel's mother seems to prevail
 biovulf, apane haranting se apane dushman ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa paa rahaa haikar saktaa apane dushman main, yah use krodhit karata he
 Beowulf again escapes his enemy's attack due to his armor, or is and hurts Grendel's mother's hands with his sword, Beowulf beheads him
 khoh main aage jane par, biovulf ko grandal kii laash milti he, vah uskaa sir kaat kar apane paas rakh letaa he
 Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his comrades after "nine hours"
 vah hioroot jaataa he, jahaan harugar biovulf ko apane parivaar kii viraasat nagling talwaar sahit kai uphaar detaa he
 Beowulf returns home and later becomes king of his own people
 ek din, biovulf ke jivan main kuch samay pashchaat, ek gulam airnanes main agyaat dregon ke maand se ek swarna cap churaataa he
 When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, he angrily comes out of his cave and burns everything out of his sight
 biovulf or uske yoddha dregon se ladane jate hai, lekin jab biovulf dregon ke waar se ghayal ho jaataa he, to uske sabhi yoddha dar kar bhaag khadey hote hai
 Only one warrior, a brave young wiggle, stops to help Beowulf
 donon milakar dregon ko maar giraate hai, lekin biovulf kii uske ghaavon ke kaaran maut ho jaati he
 After the cremation, Beowulf is buried in a rock near the sea, where seafarers can see his tumulus
 dragon ke khajaane ko logon ke bich vitarit karne ke baajaay biovulf kii icchaanusaar uske saath hi dafan kar diya jaataa he
 There is a curse associated with that pile
 yah vyapak rup se sweekaarya he ki biovulf kii teen shavyatraaen kii gai thim
 These funerals help to change the outline of the poem's story as well as to change the audience's views on worldly possessions, war and fame
 shavyatraaon ko upar varnit teen yudhon ke saath jodakar bhi dekha jaataa he
 The three funerals share the same proposal of change in theme through the description of each funeral
 gail oven-croker ne apni pustak da for funerals in biovulf main tark diya he ki kavita ke le of last cerviver" ke rup main jaani jaati he, jo ki ek atirikt antim sanskaar he
 The funeral processions include the ritual of self-accumulation: evidence of sacrificial objects with both religious and socio-economic functions
 kavita main pehali shavyatra ko dens kaa raja scield sefing kaha gaya he 
 The first part helps the poet explain the settings of the poem by introducing Hrothgar's lineage
 shavyatra nayak biovulf or pehle daanav grandal ke saath ke takaraav kaa parichay he
 The excerpt begins with a description of Scheild's glory as "the curse of many tribes, the destroyer of the liquor table
" scield kii mahima or mahatv ko uski pratishthit maut dwaara darshaya gaya he, jo use dence ke raja ke rup main seva karte hue praapt hui thi
 His importance once again proves his grand funeral procession carried out by the people: the many weapons and treasures displayed at his funeral are proof of his being a great warrior and great leader
 kavi ne scield ke madhyam se nayakik samaaj ko prastut kiya he
 The importance of such items is described by burying them with the king's property
 in sansaarik sampattiyon ke mahatv kaa upyog baad main khajaane ke sambandh main is mrit raja kii mahanata sthapit karne main kii gai he
 Scheild's funeral helps the poet to explain how heroism and worldly possessions define the importance of an individual in the war of judicial society
 yah antim sanskaar kavi kii madad pratipakshi, biovulf or mukhya daanav grandal ke bich kii sajeesh ke patal ko viksit karne main karata he
 The second rite in the poem is that of the family Hildeburg and the poem is on the second number of FITT
 antim sanskaar ko hioroot main grandal par biovulf kii jeet kaa jashn manaane ke liye gaaya jaataa he
 It also marks the hero's victory in the battle against Grendel's mother
 yuddh main hildebrg ke bhai, bete or pati kii maut ho gai thi
 Scheild was also killed in the fight and is also the saga of the extraordinary wealth used in the funeral of the dead
 den ke raja kii tarah, hildebrg ke rishtedaaron ko bhi unke hathiyaar or swarna ke saath unki mahatvata ko darshane ke liye dafnaaya gaya tha
 However, the funeral procession of relatives was not as grand, it was only a funeral ceremony
 iske alaava, kavi ne yuddh main marane waalon kii bhaawanaaon ko bhi chitrit kiya he
 Horrific details such as "melting heads, open mortal wounds 


 and blood coming out of the body" describe the war as a painful and horrific accident rather than a heroic tale
 haalanki kavi ne maut se zyada sampatti ke vishay ko mahatvata dene kii puri koshish kii he, phir bhi yuddh kii mahima ko shaatir yuddh kii pravriti chunauti detii he
 The second funeral procession displays a different concept than the first, and a change in the direction of the story leads to Beowulf's fight against Grendel's mother
 "le of da last cerviver" taarkik rup se anya dafnaae gaye logon ke mahatv ko nirdhaarit samaantaaon ke kaaran biovulf ke teen anya shavyatraaon ke atirikt he
 The similarities that identify this passage with the three other funeral processions are similar to burial ceremonies, changes in setting and role, and changes in theme
 shok ek shavyatra jaisaa prathit hota he kyonki dafan prastaavon main antim uttarajive ke varnan hai, jo ki scield sefing, hildebrg ke parijan or biovulf kii shavyatraaon main bhi milte hai
 The Last Survivor tells of the many treasures left by the dead, such as weapons, weapons, and gold cups, whose "best shining cups 


, blood-soaked weapons and armor" of Scheldt, "blood-soaked armor of the family of Hildeburg
 And there are considerable similarities with the discovery of pig-shaped helmets "and Beowulf's dragons
 is ansh ko shavyatra ke rup ambling hoque swift horse" bhi he
 It is an animal offering that was a ritual to be buried during the era of poetry
 iske alaava, yah ansh, anya shavyatraaon kii tarah, setting or bhoomika ke parivartanon ko nirdisht karata he
 People also say that the third part of the poem describes the time spent during the last battle between Beowulf and the dragon
 kavi ne yuddh main hui mauton ko bhayaavah bataaya he, jo ki antim uttarajive kii aankhon ke madhyam se kavita ke duusare bhaag kii avadharana ko aage badhaata he
 The fourth funeral procession mentioned in the poem is the original funeral of Beowulf
 dregon ke khilaaf antim yuddh ke baad, biovulf ko ghaatak ghaav lagate hai or uskaa dehanth ho jaataa he
 The greatness of Beowulf's life is described in his funeral, especially through the many tributes of his people
 In addition, the vast treasure of dragons was buried with the hero
 kavi ne bhi biovulf ke antim sanskaar ke varnan ko anya kii apeksha adhik mahatv diya he
 For the funeral of their leader, "viohsten's son announces to many people that he should stay away from the pyre
" The remains of the dragons are thrown into the sea parallel to Scyld's tomb
 biovulf kii shavyatra kavita kaa chauthaa bhaag he, jo us nayak ko shradhanjali he, jo "shaleen or nishpaksh, logon ke dayaalu or jeetne ke liye samvedansheel" tha
 The first known owner of the Beowulf manuscript is the 16th-century scholar Lawrence Nowell, after whom the manuscript is named, although its official designation is Cotton Vitellius A
XV, as it was one of the possessions of Robert Bruce Cotton in the mid-17th century

 He referred to this work as the era of Canute the Great

 In a letter to Wanley, Hiches made a clear allegation against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith Cotton MS

 Beowulf has failed to mention the script when making xv's catalog
 hikes ne vaanale ko uttar diya "mujhe biovulf se sambandhit ab tak kuch nahin mila"

 The original Beowulf manuscript was transcribed by two clerks: cleric a and cleric B, whose letter is placed in line 1939
 donon lipikon kii likhaawat kaa bilkul bhi nahin milte hai
 Clerk B's script is archaic
 donon lipikon ne apane kaam ko sahi kiya he or lipic bi ne lipic e ke kaam kii bhi sahi kiya he
 The work of Clerk b has a similarity to the work of the first clerical of the Blickering Homilies, and even to the extent that they are written with the same script
 pratilekhan malmesbari abi ke librari main rakhe or strot kaaryon ke rup main uplabdh gyaan kii pustakon se or paath main paae jane vaali sthaneey boli ke kuch vishisht shabdon se likhi gai prathit hoti he
 However, for at least a century, some scholars maintain that Grendel's character in Beowulf was derived from St
 Paul's view of hell in Homily 16 of the Blickering Homilies
 iceland ke vidwaan grimer johnson throkaleen ne dainish sarkaar ke aitihaasik anusandhan ayog ke antargat kaam karte hue, pandulipi kaa pehla pratilekhan 1786 main kiya or 1815 main use prakashit kiya
 He transcribed one himself and got the other transcriptionists who did not know anglo-saxon
 Since that time, the manuscript has been twisted several times, yet Throcklein's transcription remains a valuable secondary source for Beowulf scholars

 His accuracy came under question and in fact the Throklein manuscript was said to be ambiguous despite the highly readable manuscript of the time

 It has been variously dated between the 8th century and the early 11th century
 yah aitihaasik pariprekshya kii ek mahakavy kavita he; mahakavy ghatnaon or mahanatam ateet ke veeron kii ek kahani he
 Although its author is unknown, its themes and subject matter resemble European heroic poems rooted in the original anglo-saxon tradition and plowed by scoops

 Felt that the manuscripts present the transcription of the exhibit, although may have taken more than one meeting
 keayrnan peliographical or kodicological saakshyon ke aadhaar par tark diya he ki kavita pandulipi ke saath samakaleen he
 Kiernan's argument corresponds to part of the political context of the much-talked-about poem: Most scholars have also recently stated that the poem was written in the 8th century, and they infer it on the basis that the poem's extreme sympathy for Danes Is shown and there is no possibility of it being written by anglo-saxon during the Viking era in the 9th and 10th centuries
 keayrnan ke tark 8veen sadi ke udgam ke khilaaf hai, kyonki iske liye bhi yah jaruri he ki kavita kii anglo-sexon dwaar viking yug main pratilekhan kii gai ho, peliographical or kodicological sakshya is vishwaas ko badhaava dete hai ki biovulf 11veen sadi ke samgr kii kavita he or yah kahatha he ki e or lipic bi lekhak the or lipic bi donon main se adhik maarmik tha

 Tolkien is of the opinion that the poem, written a few generations after the completion of Christianity in England around 700 AD, contains a genuine memory of anglo-saxon paganism
 tolkin kaa drudh vishwaas ki kavita 8veen sadi main likhi gai thi, ko tom shippi kaa samarthan praapt he
 The suggestion by John Mitchell Kimbley and the defense of jatching brings at least one early 9th-century Finnsburg episode to a terminus post quem
 kimbali ne aitihaasik almainic nobalman hoching ke putr hnobi ke saath hoque ke putr hnaf ke kirdaar kii pahchaan kii or 800 i
 ke shuruyaat main frisia par aadhaarit purv ank par kaam kiya
 The date of the 11th century is due to scholars who argue that, rather than the transcription of the story from oral tradition by a literate monk, Beowulf reflects the original interpretation of the story by the poet
 biovulf uski vartmaan pandulipi se pehle kabhi kisi maukhik parampara main lipt rahaa he yaa nahin, yah prashn sadiyon se bahes kaa vishay he or isamen iskaa nirmaan kaise hua, iske alaava bhi kai or prashn shaamil hai
 Rather, it refers to the principle of oral-formulaic structure and oral tradition, the question of how to understand the poem and what type of interpretation is needed
 maukhik parampara ke sandarbh main biovulf par vidwaanon kii charchaa 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main atyant sakriy thi
 The debate can be seen as: On the one hand, we can infer the poem by bringing together several stories related to the protagonist
 in tukdon ko parampara ke kaaran kai varshon tak rakhaa jayega or aane vaali peedi ke kaviyon kii iske dwaara shikshuta pradaan kii jaaegi
 kavita ko maukhik rup se bina kisi taiyaari ke likhaa gaya he or yah ek parmparik puralekhan he, jo maukhik, butaparast, german, vir or adivasee sabhi ko aakarshith karata he
 On the other hand, some people believe that the poem was written by a literate clerk who was literate while learning Latin, possibly a monk or a Christian with a deep outlook
 is paksh par, butaparast ke sandarbh sajaavati puralekhan kii koi vidhi hogi
 According to the third view both the above mentioned debates are correct and this is an attempt to add them, so they cannot be expressed as conflicting; Accordingly, the work of poetry contains a glimpse of more than one Christian and more than one pagan spirit, which has been separated from each other for several hundred years; It says that the poem was originally written by a literate Christian writer who had knowledge of paganism and may have had ancestors and pagan converts, a poet who was proficient in both oral and literate clerks
 And who was able to "reconstruct" the poetry of oral tradition; This early Christian poet saw his desire to sacrifice for justice and his efforts to help and protect the needy, and the greatest security; Good pagan people were seen choosing the right path and so this poet presented the pagan culture with patience and respect; Yet the creation of this early Christian poet and much later composer is "fire-and-brimstone", a Christian poet who calls the pagan practice dark and sinful and which added to the demonic aspects of its demons

 abram or stephen greenblot ne angreji sahitya ke norton sankalan main biovulf kaa parichay karaate hue kaha he ki, "kavi ne virgatha kii bhashaa, style or pracheen europea maukhik kavita kii butaparast duniya ko punerjeevit kiya gaya tha yah aap vyapak rup se mana jaataa he ki biovulf ek ekal kavi kii rachana he jo ek isai tha or uski kavita isai parampara ko darshaati he

 For example, the scholar states that poetry was delivered from the reader to the reader by the principle of oral-formulaic composition, which suggests that epic poems are improved from time to time by the reader
 apane aitihaasik kaam main, kahaniyon ke gayak, albert lord francis pi
 mogon or dusron ke kaaryon kaa sandarbh yah kehete hue dete hai ki "dastavezikaran purna, pralekhith or or sateek he"
 yah sampurna vishleshan yah sabit karne ke liye paryaapt he ki biovulf kii rachana maukhik thi
 Beowulf and other anglo-saxon poems have mixed results from tests conducted for oral-formulated composition
 jabaki "vishay" anglo-sexon or anya europea kaaryon main maujuud hai, kuch vidwaan, tark dete hai ki kavitaayen shabd-dar-shabd ke aadhaar or kai sutron or paddatiyon kaa anusaran karke rachi jaati hai
 Larry Benson has argued that interpreting Beowulf as a purely formative work undermines the reader's ability to analyze that the poem is written in unified form and that they cannot concentrate on the poet's creativity 
 iske bajaay, unhone prastaavit kiya ki german sahitya ke anya anshon main "parampara ke tatv" hai jinase biovulf uddhrut or vistaarit hua he
 a few years later, Ann Watts published a book, in which she described the traditional, Homer, oral-formulaic theory for anglo-saxon poetry as incomplete
 unhone yah bhi tark diya he ki do paramparaon kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati or isliye aisa nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Thomas Gardner agreed with Watts, arguing in a newspaper published four years ago that the Beowulf text is of diverse nature and is constructed entirely by formulas and themes
 jon miles fole ne biovulf bahes ke sandarbh main vishesh rup se kaha he ki, jabaki tulanaatmak kaary aavashyak or maanya donon he, lekin iskaa aayojan di gai paramparaon kii vishistataaon ke saath dekhnaa chahie; fole ne maukhik paaramparik siddhant ke vikaas ko dekhte hue tark diya ki rachana ke bare main asatyaapit anumaan kaa anumaan na lagaaein or na hi isapar nirbhar hon or paramparikta or paathyata ke avichhinnak ke paksh main kii gai rachana par maukhik / likhit manyataon par dhyaan kendrit na karen
 Ultimately, in the view of Ursula Scheffer, the poem was "oral" or "written", this question becomes somewhat like a red herring
 is model main, kavita kii rachana kii gai he or vah donon maansik kshitij ke bheetar vyakhya ke yogya he
 Scheffer's "oral" concept proposes neither an agreement nor a coincidence of ideas that treat the poem as European, pagan and oral on the one hand, and quoting it from Latin, Christian or literate on the other, but as Monica Otter states: "


 'a coin of rupees', is found in both oral and literate cultures and both have their own logic and beauty
" " Old English topics The poem has a mix of Old English Western Saxon and Anglian dialects, although they are more of a dialect of Western Saxon, as many other Old English poems were copied at the same time
 biovulf pandulipi main bhashaai rup main ek vismayakari sarani he
 This is the fact that has led some scholars to believe that Beowulf's long and complex transmission has been carried out through all the main dialect areas
 kavita main nimnlikhit boliyon kaa jatil mishran he: marsian, northmbarian, aarambhik pashchimi sexon, cantish or antim pashchimi sexon
 keayrnan kaa tark he ki yah lagbhag asambhav he ki us samay sancharan kii koi prakriya hui hogi jiske dwaara ek boli se duusari boli tak, peedi dar peedi or lipic dar lipic is jatil mishran ko banaae rakhaa gaya ho
 Kiernan's argument against the initial date based on a mixture of forms is long and concise, but he concludes that a mixture of forms may have indicated a relatively straightforward history of the written text as follows: 


 ek 11veen sadi kaa emes, ek 11veen sadi kaa marsian kavi ne puraatan kavy boli kaa upyog karte hue; or 11veen sadi kii maanak saahitiyik boli jo ki aarambhik yaa ant kaa ho saktaa he, dwandvatmak-boli ke roopon or vibhinn vartanee kaa prayog; or do 11veen sadi ke lipikon thoa bhinn vartanee tareekon se likhaa ho
 According to this view, Beowulf can be seen as a product of large-scale archaeological interests and it gives readers a sense of the 11th-century anglo-saxon sentiments about Denmark and its pre-history, then the Age of Bade and the 7th or Tells more about the 8th-century anglo-saxon expressions of their ancestral homeland
 biovulf jaisi ek puraani angrezi kavita aadhunik kavita se bahut alag hoti he
 anglo-saxon poets used specific alliteration verses, a form of verses in which alliteration is used as the main structural tool for integrating lines of poetry, in place of other instruments such as rhyme
 It is a technique in which the first part of the line is connected to the second part through the same initial sound
 iske atirikt, do bhaagon ko ek yeti main vibhajit kar diya jaataa he: " oft scield sefing \ \ skipina pritom" or sanyuktakshar "cg" kaa uccharan "dj" kii tarah kiya jaataa he, jaise ki shabd "edge" main
 f or s donon ke uccharan unke dhvanyatmak vaataavaran par nirbhar karte hue bhinn hote hai
 Between vowels or consonants, there are sounds that sound like modern v and z
 anyathaa ve chup rahati hai, jaise aadhunik "fat" main f or "sat" main s
 kuch akshar jo ab aadhunik angrezi main nahin milte hai, jaise thorn, þ or eth, ð - aadhunik angrezi "th" ke donon uccharan "cloth" or "clothe" main kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai- kaa upyog mul pandulipi or aadhunik angrezi ke sanskarnon main vyapak rup se kiya gaya he
 The sound of these characters resonates like f and s
 donon swar hai or anya swar dhvaniyon ke bich main hai: oðer, laþleas, suþern
 anyathaa ve aghosh hoti hai : þunor, suð, soþfæst
 Canning is also an important technique in Beowulf
 ve rosemara ke chizon ke udbodhak kaavyatmak varnan hai, aksar pad main anupras kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye banaaya jaataa he
 For example, a poet might call the sea "swan-road" or "whale-road"; a king can be called a "ring-giver"
 biovulf main kai caning hai or upkaran puraani angrezi kii theth clasik kavita hoti he, jisamen bahut saare sutara hote hai
 There is also widespread use of vowel-figurative forms in poetry

 In historical context, the characters of the poem may have been Norse paganism, although the poem was recorded by Christian anglo-saxon who converted widely to anglo-saxon paganism in the 7th century - both anglo-saxon paganism and Norse paganism are cited from European paganism

 In the poem depicting the warrior society, the most important aspect of human relationships existed between the warrior - thean - and his master, a relationship that was based on mutual trust and respect rather than one man's submission to the will of another man
 
 jab ek yoddha apane swami ke prati vafadari kii kasam khaataa he, to vah uske naukar kii bajaay ek svaichhik saathi ban jaataa he, jise apane swami kaa bachaav karne or yuddh main uske ke liye ladane main garv mahasoos hota he
 In return, Swami was expected to take care of his thanqui and award him for his valor

 Stanley B
 Greenfield suggests that references to the human body throughout Beowulf emphasize the relative position of their masters of Thanes
