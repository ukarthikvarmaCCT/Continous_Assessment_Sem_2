 Pulp Fiction is self-referential from its earliest moments, it begins with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of "pulp"
 tarantino ke adhikansh anya kaaryon ke saath di plot ko kalanukramik kram ke anusaar prastut kiya gaya he
 The picture's self-analysis, unconventional structure and widespread use of homage and adulteration have led critics to describe it as a prime example of postmodern film
 kuch aalochakon ne ise ek blike kamedi mana he, ise aksar ek "nio-noir" kaa label bhi lagaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Critic Geoffrey o'brien argues that "old-time noir feelings, melancholy contemplations, and scenes of operatic death all remained out of whack, but it created an astonishing state that resembled a spell performed by Tarantino
" 
 yah na to nio-noir he naa hi noir kii parody he"
 isi tarah, nicholas christopher kaha ki yah "nio-noir kii tulana main gengland camp adhik he", or foster hirsh ne kaha ki isaki "treeppi kalpana paridrishy" ise kisi bhi anya parmparik label se adhik vishesh rup se parilakshith karti he
 Pulp fiction was seen as an inspiration for many later films, adopting many elements of its genre in these films

 The impact of a cultural wave pulp fiction has also been felt in many other popular media
 lekhak or nirdeshak quentin tarantino kii araikhik kahani ke trademark ke saath, isaki kahani ko kram ke baahar prastut kiya gaya he
 The story of Pulp Fiction revolves around three different but interrelated stories — in Tarantino's concept, mob hitmen Vincent Vega is leading the first story, professional boxer Butch Coolidge is leading the second story and Vincent's Fellow contract killer, Jules Winfield, is leading the third story
 haalanki har kahani ghatnaon kii ek alag shrinkhalaa par dhyaan kendrit karti he, phir bhi ye kahaniyaan kai tarah se ek duusare se judy hui hai or ek duusare se sambandh rakhti hai
 The film begins with a dinner hold-up staged by "pumpkin" and "honey Bunny", followed by stories by Vincent, Jules, Butch and several other characters, including mob kingpin Marcellus Wallace, his wife , Mia and Winston Wolfe solving the underworld
 ant main yah kahani vahiin, dinar main pahunch jaati he, jahaan se yah shuru hui thi: vinset or juls, jo ek grass ke liye rukate hai, khud hi hold-ap main ulajh jate hai
 It has a total of seven narrative series — three primary stories preceding the identification of differential titles on a black screen
 yadi saat anukramon ko kalanukram ke anusaar lagaaya jaye to ye honge: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5

 Other analysts simply describe the structure as a "circular narrative"
 "pumpkin" or "hani bani" ek diner main naashtaa le rahe hai
 They decide to rob, thinking that they can make money not only from business but also from customers, as happened during their previous robbery
 jab ve hold-ap shuru karte hai, uske thik baad drishy tut jaataa he or sheershak ghoomane lagata he
 While Jules is driving to Winnfield, Vincent Vega talks about his experience in Europe from where he has just returned — the hash bar in Amsterdam; French mcdonald's and its "royal With Cheese"
 In appropriate attire, the couple is going to take the briefcase from Brett, who is up against his Bose Gangster Marcellus Wallace
 juls vincent ko bataata he ki marcelas ko kisi ne chauthi manzil kii balakani se gira diya tha kyonki usne uski patni ke pair kii maalish kii thi

 He is in the color of his boxing — it is time to fight
 He is given money to throw

 When he takes a taxi to escape, he learns from the dying driver Esmeralda Villalobos that he killed the opposing fighter

 The next morning, at the motel where he and his girlfriend, Fabine, are taking, Butch learns that she forgot to pack the very important watch
 vah ise lene ke liye apane apartment main waapas aata he, haalanki marcelas ke aadmi nishchit rup se use hi dhund rahe hai
 Butch quickly finds the clock, but realizes that he is alone, so he stops to eat something

 Upon hearing the sound of a flush from the toilet, Butch gets ready with a gun so that he can kill Vincent Vega while coming out of the bathroom

 Marcellus tells Butch that they are all the same in this useless fight, they will never tell anyone about rape and leave Los Angeles forever

 The story returns to Vincent and Jules on Brett

 The hit completes the last of the men
 pulp fiction kii patakatha ko 1990 ke ant main roger every dwaara likhaa gaya, iskaa pehla tatv: The initial inspiration for this was a three-part horror compilation film Black Sabbath, produced by Italian filmmaker Mario Bava
 tarantino-every pariyojna ko asthaayee sheershak "blike mask" diya gaya, yah sheershak praathmik hardboild aparaadh katha patrika ke aadhaar par diya gaya tha
 Tarantino's script was made like his first film Reservoir Dogs; Avery's title, "pandemonium Rhines", formed the basis for Pulp Fiction's "gold watch" tale
 rigervoyar dogs par kaam puraa karne ke saath, tarantino ek trayee film kii dharna kii ore laut aaye: "mujhe kuch aisa karne kaa vichaar aayaa jise karne kaa mauka ek upanyaaskaar ko mil jaataa he lekin film nirmaataa ko nahin: isamen teen alag alag kahaniyaan di gayin, jisamen kahani ke aadhaar par paatr kahani ke andar or baahar aate jate rahete hai
 " tarantino bataate hai ki isamen mul vichaar tha sabase purana akhrot jo aapane kabhi dekha ho, jab aparaadh kii kahaniyon main aata he to kya hota he- pustak kii sabase puraani kahaniyaan


 aap jaanate hai, 'vincent vega or marcelas wales kii patni-- us ladke ke bare main sabase puraani kahani jo bade aadmi kii patni ke saath baahar jaataa he or use choota bhi nahin he
 You know, you must have seen such a story many times
 " "main kahani sunaane ke puraane tareeke kaa istemaal kar rahaa hoon or jaanboojh kar unhen dharashayi kar detaa hoon
" ve kehete hai
 "part of the trick is to show these characters in the film more situations and actually apply them to some real-life rules and see how they unfold
 " Tarantino went to Amsterdam in March 1992 to work on the script for Pulp Fiction
 vahaan par every unke saath mil gaye, jinhone is pariyojna main "pendemonium rhins" se yogadan diya or isaki nayi kahani ko phir se likhane or iske vikaas ke liye bhaag liya, yah kahani isse milti julati thi
 Two scenes, originally written by Avery, for the actual romance screenplay, are attributed to Tarantino, these scenes shown at the beginning of "bonnie Situation": the "miraculous" manner of shooting by the Hidden Gun Men
 Missing and killing in the automobile on the back seat
 Inspired by the "cleanser" of the crime world that became the main part of the episode by a small, doom, Tarantino saw it at a film festival
 unhone pulp fiction main mukhya abhinetri angela jones ko liya or baad main sanhaar kii ek feechar lambaai ke sanskaran ke film nirmaataa ke utpaadan kaa samarthan kiya
 The screenplay featured two commercial brands, often featured in later Tarantino films: Big Kahuna Burgers and Red Apple Cigarettes
 While working on the screenplay, Tarantino also accompanied Reservoir Dogs around European film festivals
 Released in the US in October 1992, the film was very important and went on to become a commercial success
 In January 1993, the script for Pulp Fiction was completed
 tarantino or uske nirmaataa, laurence bender is patakatha ko jersey films main laaye, yah ek production company he jise deni davito, maaikel shemberg or stasi sher ke dwaara sanchalit kiya jaataa he
 Even before seeing Reservoir Dogs, Jersey wanted to sign Tarantino's next project
 antat 1 million dollar kii keemat kaa ek sauda kiya gaya-is saude ne ek band ke alaava, bender or tarantino kii nav nirmit production company ko praarambhik vittaposhan or karyaalay suvidhaayen pradaan kin; jersey ko pariyojna kaa ek hissaa mila or use patakatha ko ek studio par bechney kaa adhikaar bhi praapt hua
 Jersey signed and distributed a "first look" deal with Columbia Tri Star, which gave Tarantino the right to consider its options in practice
 In February, Pulp Fiction appeared on a list of several varieties of films in preproduction on Tri Star
 In June, however, the studio changed the script
 ek studio adhikari ke mutabik, tristar ke pramukh mike medavoy ne ise "bahut uttejit" paaya
 There were suggestions that tristar was resistant to endorsement of a film featuring a heroin user; There were also indications that the studio saw it as a very low-budget project for its star-made image
 Averi — who was about to begin shooting for his directorial debut Killing Zoe — said that tristar's objections were widespread and included the basic structure of the screenplay
 ve studio kii sthiti ko parilakshith karte hai: "yah ab tak likhi gayi sabase buree cheez he
 It makes no sense
 koi mar jaataa he or phir ve jinda ho jate hai
 It is too long, violent and unfit for films
 '


 to maine sochaa ki, 'dats det! Bender brought the screenplay to Miramax, formerly an independent studio, recently acquired by Disney
 miramax ke adhyaksh, harvey vinstin apane bhai bob ke saath- is patakatha se tunrat romanchit hue or company ne ise chun liya
 Pulp Fiction was the first Miramax project to receive the green light following its acquisition of Disney, with a budget of $ 8
5 million
 yah pehali film ban gayi jo puri tarah se miramax ke dwaara vittposhit thi
 Bender paid the same amount of money to all actors every week to help reduce the price, not to mention their status in the industry
 is pariyojna ko sin karne vaala sabase bada star tha bruce villis
 haalanki ve haal hi main kai bade bajet kii flop filmon main dikhaai die, phir bhi ve pramukh videshi aakarshan the
 On the strength of its name, Miramax earned $ 1
1 million for the worldwide rights to the film, ensuring its profits indeed
 jon trolta vincent vega ke rup main: tarantino ne trolta ko pulp fiction main keval isliye liya kyonki maaikel madsan, jisaki reserveoyar dogs main-vik vega kii- mukhya bhumika thi, ne iske bajaay kevin costner kii vayat arp ko chunaa
 madsan abhi bhi ek dashak se bhi adhik samay ke baad apni pasand ko mahatva de rahe hai
 Harvey Weinstein emphasized on Daniel Day Lewis
 Travolta accepted a rate for his services — sources claim the rate was $ 100,000 or $ 140,000 — but the film's success and his nomination as Best Actor for the Oscars revived his career done
 Travolta later appeared in a number of hit films, including Get Shortly, in which he played a similar character and was also featured in the John Woo block buster Face / Off
 2004 main, tarantino ne ek aisi film ke vichaar par charchaa kii, jisamen vega bhaaiyon ke rup main trolta or madsan abhinayta honge; yah avadharana abhi tak abhyaas main nahin aayi he
 Samuel L
 as Jules Winfield Jackson: Tarantino had written Jackson's part in his mind but the audition for the role of Paul Calderone was overshadowed by the actor
 jackson ne man ki yah audishan ek pathan maatr tha
 Harvey Weinstein betrayed Jackson for the audition for the second time, and his performance for the final dinner scene won him over Tarantino
 Jules originally wrote the screenplay with a giant Afro, but Tarantino and Jackson agreed to the zerikirld wig scene in the film
 jackson ko sarvshereshth sahaayak abhinayta ke liye auskar namakan mila
 kalderron film main marcelas ke daahine haath, paul ke rup main dikhaai dete hai
 Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace: Miramax favors Holly Hunter or Meg Ryan for the role
 alfre woodard or meg tili par bhi vichaar kiya gaya, lekin tarantino apni pehali baithak ke baad thuraman ko chahta tha
 She dominated most of the film's promotional material, she appears on a bed with a cigarette in hand
 unhen sarvshereshth sahaayak abhinetri auskar ke liye namankit kiya gaya or celibrity A-suchi main shaamil kiya gaya
 He took advantage of his new fame quite a bit and opted not to act in any big budget film for the next three years
 Thurman later went on to star in two of Tarantino's Kill Bill films

 The shooting of Pulp Fiction began on 20 September 1993
 All the main off-screen talents worked with Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs — cinematographer Andrzej Sekula, film editor Celie Menke and production designer David Vasco
 According to Tarantino, "we had $ 8 million
 
main chahta hum ki yah film 20-25 dollar kii film kii tarah dikhe
 main ise ek mahakavy kii tarah dekhnaa chahta hum
 yah har drushti se ek mahakavy he- mahatvakanksha main, lambaai main, kshetra main, keemat ke alaava har cheez main

 No film score was composed for Pulp Fiction with Quentin Tarantino, instead an eclectic assortment of surf music, rock and roll, soul, and pop music
 shuruyaat main dick del kaa "missirlou" kaa gayan darshaya jaataa he
 Tarantino has chosen surf music as the original musical style for the film, but he is not emphasizing much because of its association with surfing culture: "for me it's just like stop and roll, here In addition, there is Moricon music
 isaki dhwani rock or role spegheti pashchimi sangeet kii tarah he
 Some of the songs were suggested to Tarantino by his friends Chuck Kelly and Laura Lovelace, who were credited by music advisors

 Despite Tarantino's statements, there are several solutions for which one scholar calls it "the obscure postmodern puzzle" that has been proposed
 1955 kii film noir kis me dadli ke saath ek bahut hi prabal samanta dekhi gayi he
 The film, whose protagonist Tarantino is a source for Butch, values a glowing briefcase containing nuclear explosives

 Much of Pulp Fiction revolves around characters who are in the bathroom or have to use the bathroom; Other films by Tarantino also reflect the same troupe, although they have somewhat less range

 In later years, Islam was considered a religious sect only due to opposition from the people of Mecca and the departure of Muhammad from Medina

 Many people became Muslims under the influence of their followers

 Those believing this belief were called Shia

 mobile phone aajkal har vyakti kii aavashyaktaa ban chukaa he
 Users of Hindi on Internet want a phone so that they can use Hindi on their phone as well, which includes surfing of Hindi sites, email, chat, blogging, tweeting, etc
 ab prashn uthta he ki mobile phone main hindi kaa samarthan kis rup main he
 There are mainly three aspects of Hindi support in mobile
 mobile par hindi paathya athwa taxt kaa pradarshan ho saktaa he yaa nahin? yadi phone main hindi dikh hi nahin sakati to input to hoga hi nahin, hindi samarthan kii yah pehali shart he
 Some phones have full support of Hindi display
 kuch main aanshik unicode samarthan hone se hindi dikhaai to detii he lekin sahi rup se nahin yani matraayen evam sanyuktakshar sahi rup se prakat nahin hote or hindi bikhri hui si dikhaai detii he
 The reason for this is that the phone has a Hindi font, but the phone's complex script layout engine does not support Hindi, that is, it does not render Devanagari correctly
 aise phonon main kuch softwaron main hindi sahi rup se dikh sakati he jo ki phone kii bajaay apana hindi font ingine prayog karte hon
 In phones where Hindi is not supported at all, coaches appear instead of Hindi
 yadi phone main hindi pradarshan hetu samarthan he to input kaa vikalp ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 If the phone has the option of Hindi input, then SMS can be sent in Hindi and Hindi can be written in the text box anywhere on the web
 is vikalp ke hone par mobile se hindi main email bhejne, chitthee likhane, tippanee karne samet internet par tamaam kaary hindi main kiye ja sakate hai
 Most phones have a T-9 system for Hindi typing
 sabhi devanagari varnon ko keepad ke nau batano par samyojit kiya jaataa he tathaa baar-baar dabaakar sahi varna tip kiye jate hai
 Additionally, many phones also have a T-9 prediction so that words can be typed by simply pressing a few buttons with predictive input
 purvanumaan phone main hindi main saralata se tip karne main bahut sahaayak he, thode abhyaas ke uparant purvanumaan se kaaphi gati se hindi tip kii ja sakati he
 Words that are not in the phone's prediction dictionary can be added so that they can be typed by prediction next time
 tach screen vaale jin kuch phonon main hindi samarthan uplabdh he unamem iske liye inascript onscreen virtual keyboard hota he
 It is like the image of a computer so that Hindi can be written anywhere on the phone
 hindi interphes se arth he ki phone main interphes bhashaa ke rup main hindi kaa vikalp hona
 On selecting the Hindi interface language in the phone, all the menus, options etc
 are displayed in Hindi
 yadhyapi hindi interphes kaa vikalp uplabdh hone par bhi prayog bahut kam log karte hai jiskaa kaaran ashuddh anuwaad tathaa clisht shabdaawalee hota he
 If the phone has an option of interface language Hindi, then generally Hindi display and input support will be there
 nokia phone main iskaa pataa lagane ke liye menu>settings>phone>phone Language main jaaen
 If it is, then your phone has display and input support, the interface may or may not be language
 yah pataa lagane ke liye kisi anya phone se us phone par hindi main sandesh bhej kar dekhie athwa yadi phone main jeepiaras sakasham he to koi hindi site khol kar dekhie

 kisi taxt box main hindi input sakasham karne hetu options>writing languages>hindi main jaayen athwa phone kii "*" kunjee dabaakar rakhen to Writing Languages kaa vikalp aa jaataa he
 The words can be typed by just pressing a few buttons with predictive text input
 purvanumaan phone main hindi main saralata se tip karne main bahut sahaayak he, thode abhyaas ke uparant purvanumaan se kaaphi gati se hindi tip kii ja sakati he
 Words that are not in the phone's prediction dictionary can be added so that they can be typed by prediction next time

 There were several categories of these feudal lords whose top place consisted of a king
 uske neeche vibhinn koti ke samant hote the or sabase nimna str main kisaan yaa das hote the
 It was an organization of guards and subordinates
 raja samast bhoomi kaa swami mana jaataa tha
 The feudal lords were loyal to the king, equipped the army to protect him and in return got land from the king
 samantgan bhoomi ke kray-vikray ke adhikari nahin the
 In the early period feudalism did commendable service to the society by making proper arrangements for local security, agriculture and justice
 kalantar main vyaktigat yuddh evam vyaktigat swaarth hi saamanton kaa uddeshy ban gaya
 Feudalism disappeared due to the rise of resource-rich new cities, the invention of gunpowder, and the rise of nationalism in place of local royalism
 
 Feudalism in Europe generally flourished under these circumstances
 roman samrajya ke tuutane ke baad us par pashchimi europe kii asabhy jatiyaan-frank lombard tathaa goth ityadi ne adhikaar kar liya
 These robbery castes gave a new look to society and government
 paanchavin shatabdi tak roman samrajya apni raksha karne main asamarth ho chuke the
 Italy's villages had become insecure due to the German invasion of barbaric castes, as the government was not able to protect, as a result of which the public compromised the powerful class for their protection
 yahi shaktishaalee varg aage chalakar samantvaad ke aadhaar bane
 In Encyclopडियाdia Britannica, there is also a special emphasis on the need for safety
 uske anusaar ‘‘samantvaad ke janm main suraksha kii bhaavana pradhan thi
 The need for a power that could provide them protection at any cost was being felt to relieve the possible foreign aggression and uncontrolled demands of government officials
 ’’ The rise of feudalism in Europe has been another tremendous reason
 samrajya ke duurastha vistaar ke kaaran samraat puure samrajya kaa sucharu rup se sanchaalan karne main asamarth tha
 Hence decentralization of power took place which was a step in the direction of democracy with necessary work being done
 dhire-dhire janata ko suraksha pradaan karne vaala yah shaktishaalee varg arthath samantvaad sampoorn europe main fail gaya
 Its center was in the Carolinian Empire

 Feudalism had an impact on Spain in southern France

 In this context, Dr
 Ramsharan Sharma can be quoted as saying - "their political and administrative structure was formed on the basis of land grants and the same structure was based on the practice of agricultural slavery
" is pratha ke adheen kisaan bhoomi se bandhe hote the or bhoomi ke maalik ve jameendaar hote the jo asli kaashtkaaron or raja ke bich kadi kaa kaam karte the
 DDR Bhandari also considers "feudalism" as a form of cautious government in which the feudal lords acted
 kuch inhen aadhaaron ko pusht karte hue dow satishchandra kaa mat he ki ‘‘europe main samantvaad kaa sambandh do vyavasthaaon se tha jinamein se ek krishi das vyavastha tathaa doosraa aadhaar tha sainik sanghathan
 On this basis, both agricultural slavery and military organization are the mainstay of feudalism
 is vishleshan ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki samantvaad europe main bhoomivyavastha se sambandhit vikendrikaran par aadhaarit ek aisi prashaskeey vyavastha thi jisamen samant sarvocch satta or kisaanon ke madhya pul tha, jo donon party se nishchit anubandhon ke madhyam se judaa hota tha
 In Europe, the feudal lords were given land as a reward for their state service, and the entire revenue of the area was under the administrative supervision of those feudals, but they received their lords from their subordinate people regularly
 Will keep sending some look
 raja afasaron ko nakad vetan ke badale jameen detaa tha
 Land was also given to other people whom the king wanted to reward
 isliye europea samantvaad main kisaanon ko, jameendaaron yaa un vyaktiyon ke liye kaam karnaa padataa tha jinhen jameen de di jaati thi or jo saamanti kehalaate the
 The duty of the feudal lords was to collect troops for the king
 pro sijavik ne samantvaad ko chaar vibhinn pravritiyon kaa parinaam mana he
 The first tendency was a person's personal relationship with another human being, which was higher than that
 apni suraksha ke drushtikon se unhonen apane se shaktishaalee vyakti ke saath sambandh sthapit kiya jo naagarikta ke naate na hokar vaiyaktik tha
 The protector and the dependent were bound by personal relationships with each other
 sangrakshak apane ashriton kii raksha karata tha tathaa ashriton kii badhati hui sankhya ke kaaran uskaa bal bad jaataa tha
 The second trend was to determine the rights, political place and social status of man
 samantvaad main vyakti ke rajnatik sambandh tathaa uski saamaajik sthiti is baat par nirbhar karti he ki vah kitni bhoomi kaa swami tha
 The third trend was that big Bhupathis started exercising political power in their territories
 yah parivartan kramshah hua
 He did not get this right from the beginning, due to the weakness of the central power, as his power increased, he increased his authority for the orderliness of his state and started ruling over them
 chauthi pravriti saamaajik virgon ke parthakt kii pravriti thi raja athwa samant par ashrith vyakti do prakaar ke hote the
 First those who were tied to kings or feudatories in exchange for military services and second those who did agriculture or other kind of work on their land
 shri ech
 es
 davis ne samtanvaad ke swaroop ko nirdhaarit karte hue isaki moulik pravritiyon kaa vishleshan karte hue kaha he ki ‘‘is vyavastha ke antargat vyakti suraksha ke drushtikon se apane prabhu se anubandhit hota tha
 He could not declare his independent power separately from his feudal lord
 yuddh saamanti vyavastha kaa pramukh siddhanth tha
 Nobody was hesitant to fight against brother and brother and against father
 nimna varg kii dasha bhi atyant shochaneey thi
 In the presented approach, more emphasis has been laid on the sense of security of the person and indicated the firmness of feudal relations and contracts
 jis prabhu se vyakti labhanvit hota tha, uske prati apane swami-bhakthi kaa pradarshan karnaa padataa tha
 The individual's personal liberty was lost
 heni es lukas ke anusaar ‘‘saamanti sanghathan main samant ko mahatvapurn sthaan praapt tha
 Q
 There were several Vesols under each feudal prince, who had restricted him to give his advice and help in the battle
 ’’ According to Mr
 Lucus, both the king and the feudal had a mutual contract, the basis of which was mutual exchange
 samant raja ko sainik sahaayta pradaan karata tha, raja ko mahatvapurn paraamarsh dekar raja kii mantranaa praapt karne kaa adhikari tha
 Mr
 Bewster, while highlighting the form of feudalism in his dictionary, wrote that "it was a political system which was based on the mutual relations of the king and the feudal land and in which service and respect was owned by the recipient of the land, assistance
 , Incidents of marriage etc
 were prominent
 ’’ In the Chambers Encyclopedia, feudalistic beliefs emphasize Swami devotion and obedience, saying that the word "feudalism, though a type of social order, mainly describes the relations between individuals who own land rights and personal property
" On the basis of a person's subordination to another person, however it is based on that individual relationship and rules Which refers to the elegant method is the protection and maintenance and follow the other hand serve and obey
 is prakaar samant ke nirvaah or samantvadah saamaajik evam aarthik vikaas prakriya suraksha kaa uttardaayitv prabhu par tha
 At the same time, the feudal was contracted by obedience and devotion to God
 ajna paalan na karne par raja keval saiddhanthik rup main usase bhoomi waapas lekar use padchyut kar saktaa tha
 This was only the initial theoretical form, but in practice it did not happen
 kalantar main yah vyavastha badal gayi
 The land was first given a lifetime, later genetic rights began to occur
 tab unhone bhi praapt bhoomi ko unheen sharton par pradaan kiya jin sharton par inhen raja se praapt hui thi
 Thus the feudal system began to be hereditary
 purvokt mat kii pushti ke sandarbh main vah vichaar dekha ja saktaa he
 The feudal system was hereditary
 samant kii mrityu ke baad uskaa uttaradhikari uskaa swami banaaya jaataa tha, jo pehle rajya darbar main jaakar kuch bhent kar raja ke prati apni swami bhakthi pragat kiya karata tha
 '' is prakaar raja dwaara samant ko or samant dwaara apane se neeche saradaaron ko bhoomi pradaan karnaa vanshanugat ho gaya or samantvaad ke ek naye str arthath upasamantvaad kaa janm hone laga
 The peasants did not belong directly to the king but to an intermediary elite class
 yadhyapi mudra kaa chalan purnatah samaapt nahin hua tha tathaapi uskaa prayog bahut kam hota tha, dhan ke rup main bhoomi kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 The most important principle of the feudal system was heredity
 paashchaatya samantvaad vishyak purvokt vidwaanon ke maton kaa vivechan-vishleshan karne par jo mukhya nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hai
 Somewhere the contractual relationship between Lord and Samanta is emphasized on the legal side, on the social side and on the economic side, but there are also some common elements which are indicated in the opinions of almost all thinkers
 in saamaanya tatwon main prabhu dwaara bhoomi anudaan or samant dwaara seva evam ajna-paalan
 Along with them, agricultural slavery is also an important element in determining the nature of European feudalism
 iske adheen kisaan bhoomi se bandhe hote the or bhoomi ke asli maalik ve jameendaar hote the jo asli kaashtkaaron or raja ke bich kadi kaa kaam karte the
 Instead of plowing land, the peasants used to pay the feudal land in the form of produce and beth
 is pranali kaa aadhaar aatmanirbhar arthvyavastha thi, jisamen chizon kaa utpaadan bazaar bazaar main bechney ke liye nahin, balki mukhyatah sthaneey kisaanon or unke maalikon ke upyog ke liye hota tha
 '' samantvaad ko lekar mote taur par koi sweekrut aadhunik paribhaasha nahin he
 The term feudalism or the feudal system was coined in the pre-modern period and was often used in political and propaganda terms
 20 veen shatabdi ke madhya tak, franswa lui ganshof ke fudilism he, 3 edishan
, samantvaad kaa ek paaramparik paribhaasha ban gaya
 Since the 1960s when Mark Bloch's Feudal Society concurred when it was first translated into English, many medieval historians incorporated a broader social aspect, adding to it the bonds of zamindari, sometimes referred to as " Referred to as "feudal system"
 1970 ke dashak ke baad se, jab elizabeth e
aar
 brown ne da tyreni of e construct prakashit kiya, kai logon ne phir se saboot kii jaanch kii or nishkarsh nikaala ki samantvaad ek asaadhya shabd he or vidvatapurna or shaikshik charchaa se puri tarah ise nikaal dena chahie yaa kam se kam keval gambhir yogyata or chetavanee ke saath iskaa istemaal hona chahie
 Outside of the European context, the concept of feudalism is commonly used by analogy, with shogun most frequently discussed in Japan and sometimes medieval and gondarine Ethiopia
 However, some analogy feudalism has been taken forward, ancient Egypt, the Parthian Empire, the Indian subcontinent, and the South of America were seen as the first diversions of the fighting
 samantvaad shabd kaa istemaal bhi kiya jaataa he - aksar anupyukt yaa prabal bhi hai madhyayugin europe kii gai un lagu-aksar anupyukt yaa nindaatmak bhang se- gaiyr pashchami deshon main jahaan sanstha or vyavhaar un madhyayugin europe ke saath samaan mana jaataa tha
 Some historians and political theories believe that the term feudalism has been used in many ways to deprive it of its specific meaning, rejecting this useful concept in understanding society
 franswa lui ganshof kaa samantvaad sanskaran bade yudhon ke bich parsparik kanoonee or sainya dayitvon kaa varnan karata he or bhagwaan, jagirdaar or milkiyat ke aasapaas teen mahatvapurn avadharanaen gumti hai
 a lord is a great reference in the broad sense that the land was occupied by a vassal god, and the land is known as the manor
 milkiyat kaa istemaal karte or prabhu ke sangrakshan ke liye videshi mudra main, jagirdaar prabhu kii seva ke kuch prakaar pradaan karegaa
 There were many varieties of tenure feudal country, including military and non-military
 swami or jagirdaar ke bich dayitvon or iske adhikaar ke bich sambandh ke vishay main saamanti jaagir ke rup ke aadhaarit tha
 Before God could grant land to anyone, they had to make that person a vassal
 ise aupchaarik or pratikatmak samaaroh main sampann kiya gaya jise prashasti samaaroh kaha gaya or yah shapath or shradhanjali adhinium do bhaagon main baanta gaya
 During the tribute Swami and the subordinates enter into a contract which the Jagirdar had to enter under his command to fight for the Lord, though the Lord had to agree to a promise to protect the Jagirdar from outside forces
 shrandhanjali latin ke fidelitas shabd se aata he or prabhu arth saamanti apane liye ek jagirdaar dwaara nishtha hota tha
 The "shraddhanjali" also refers to the oath and more explicitly confirms the vassal's commitments made during the tribute
 is tarah kii shapath shradhanjali ke baad hota tha
 Once the Commendation Ceremony was completed, a feudal relationship with the lord and the vassal was mutually agreed upon on each other
 prabhu kaa pramukh daayitv "sahaayta", yaa sainya seva ke liye jagirdaar kiya gaya tha
 The North was responsible for performing military service on behalf of the lord to call the subordinates, using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain on a revenue basis
 sainya madad kii yah suraksha kaa praathmik kaaran prabhu saamanti rishte main pravesh kiya tha

 for example, ek gunottar shrenee he jiskaa sarvanisht anupaat 3 he
 The following category is the common form of the geometric series, jahaan a shrenee kaa pratham pad tathaa r sarvanisht anupaat he
 The following table shows several geometric categories and their first terms and all the specific ratios - gunottar shrenee ke kai gun uske sarvanisht anupaat r par nirbhar karte hai
 The sum of a geometric series will be a finite number if the numerical value of its common ratio r is less than 1
 aisi sthiti main us shrenee ke baad vaale pad naganya hote chale jate hai or us shrenee main anant pad hone ke baavjood bhi yoga anant nahin, simit hota he
 Suppose we want to find the sum of the following series - This series has common ratio 2 / 3
 If we multiply through by this common ratio, then the initial 1 becomes a 2 / 3, the 2 / 3 becomes a 4 / 9, and so on: This new series is the same as the original, except that the first term is missing
 Subtracting the new series s from the original series s cancels every term in the original but the first, a similar technique can be used to evaluate any self-similar expression
 For r ≠ 1 { \ displaystyle r \ neq 1}, the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is where a is the first term of the series, and r is the common ratio
 We can derive this formula as follows: so As n goes to infinity, the absolute value of r must be less than one for the series to converge
 The sum then becomes When a = 1, this can be simplified to the left-hand side being a geometric series with common ratio r
 The formula also holds for complex r, with the corresponding restriction, the modulus of r is strictly less than one
 We can prove that the geometric series converges using the sum formula for a geometric progression: Since = 1 − rn + 1 and rn + 1 → 0 for | r | <1
 Convergence of geometric series can also be demonstrated by rewriting the series as an equivalent telescoping series
 Consider the function, Note that Thus, If then So s converges to meri kavitaai kii aadhi sadi harivansh raay bachchan kii ek kriti he

 Management accounting or managerial accounting relates to the provision and use of accounting information for managers within organizations, providing them with a basis for making sound management decisions that allow them to perform their management and control functions optimally
 Will give
 vittiya lekhankan kii jaankaree ke vipareet, prabandhan lekhankan jaankaree: This is due to various effects: management accounting information is commonly used within the organization to make decisions
 chartered institute of management accountants ke anusaar, prabandhan lekhankan "prabandhan dwaara kisi nikaay ke bheetar yojana banane, aankalan karne tathaa niyantran ke liye istemaal kii jane vaali jaankaree kii pahchaan, maap, sanchay, vishleshan, taiyaari, vyakhya or sanchaar kii prakriya tathaa apane sansadhano ke uchit upyog or javabdehi ko sunishchit karnaa he
 Management accounting also includes "the preparation of financial reports for non-management groups such as shareholders, lenders, regulatory agencies, and tax authorities"
 di american institute of certyphoid public accountants ke anusaar, abhyaas ke rup main prabandhan lekhankan kaa vistaar nimnlikhit teen kshetron tak he: According to The Institute of Certified Management Accountants, "A management accountant applies his or her knowledge and skills to preparing and presenting financial and other decision-oriented information in such a way that helps management plan and control the formulation of policies and the actions taken by the enterprise
 Received
 " Therefore management accountants are seen as "value-creators" among accountants
 ve vyavsaay ke aitihaasik recording or anupaalan ke ayaamon kii tulana main doordarshita or sanghathan ke bhavishya ko prabhavit karne vaale nirnyon ko lene main adhik ruchi lete hai
 Therefore, management accounting knowledge can be acquired from diverse fields and functions within the organization, eg, information management, funding, efficiency audit, marketing, valuation, pricing, logistics, etc

 Professional accounting institutions, perhaps fearing that management accountants would increasingly be seen as superfluous in business organizations, later devoted substantial resources to developing a more innovative skill set for management accounting

 Cost accounting is the central method in management accounting and traditionally, the key technique of management accountants was variance analysis, which is a systematic approach to the comparison of actual and budgeted costs of raw materials and labor used during the production period
 haalanki bhinnata vishleshan ke kuch prakaaron kaa upyog abhi bhi adhikansh nirmaataa farmon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 These days it seems to be trending to be used in combination with innovative techniques, such as life cycle cost analysis and activity-based costing, designed with specified dimensions of the modern business environment in the brain

 Activity-based costing assumes that, in modern factories, most manufacturing costs are determined by the magnitude of 'activities' and, therefore, the key to effective cost control is to optimize the efficiency of these activities
 gatividhi-aadhaarit lekhankan kaaran or prabhaav lekhankan ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Both life cycle costs and activity-based costs, in typical modern factories, recognize that avoidance of disruptive events is of greater importance than reducing raw material costs

 Monitoring and reviewing costs in business, including management accountant forecasting and planning of activities, performance of different analyzes, are the dual responsibilities of both the finance and business teams

 Looking at the progress in the accounting and finance career path, a broader view is that financial accounting is an important step for management accounting

 In corporations that channel most of their profits from the information economy, such as banks, publishing houses, telecommunications companies, and security contractors, information technology costs are important sources of uncontrolled spending that are often gross compensation costs in size and asset costs

 Differently speaking, management accounting information is the mechanism used by managers to simplify their control functions in the organization as a vehicle for the landscape of the entire internal structure of the organization

 irani mul ke ye kavi 1585 main bharat aaye or 1591 main apni maut tak yaheen rahe
 Urfi resident of Shiraz was named Muhammad, the title Jamaluddin and Takhallus 'urfi'
 uskaa janm 964 hi
 athwa 963 hi
 main hua
 His father Zainuddin Balvi was appointed to a high position in Shiraz
 usne tatkaaleen prachlit gyaanon ke saath-saath chitrakala kii bhi shiksha praapt kii or apane pita ke ucch pad ke anuroop apana tabllus urfi rakhaa
 His father's high position and his talent made him self-respecting even when he turned ugly due to smallpox at the age of 20 years
 parinamswaroop yuvavastha main hi apane samakaleen prasiddh irani kaviyon se takkar lene ke kaaran use iran tyagkar bharatvarsh aana padaa
 At that time not only Akbar's court attracted foreign artists, but also Akbar's high officials were no less than Iran's Shah Tahmasp Safavi and Shah Abbas Safavi in giving shelter to artists
 un logon kii sahrudayata ne use bharatgaman ke liye prerit kiya
 Urfi Shiraji reached Ahmednagar by sea in 1585 AD and from there on 10 March 1585 AD to Fatehpur Sikri, where the famous poet Sheikh Abul Faiz of Akbar's court joined the servants of 'faizi' and with him in November, 1585 AD i got stuck in Akbar's camp
 kuch samay uparaant vah akbar ke ek anya amir masihuddin hakim abul fatah kaa ashrith ho gaya
 Hakim died in 1589 AD and was adorned by the dependents of Abdurrahim Khankhana, as a result the art of Urfi continued to become more sophisticated and advanced, respectively
 khaankhaana uske prati vishesh udaartaa pradarshit karata tha
 Later he joined Akbar's court poets
 shahjada saleem se, jo jahangir ke naam se singhasanarudh hua, use bada prem tha
 But Urfi did not live long
 shavwaal, 999 hi
 main 35 athwa 36 varsh kii alpavastha main amatisar ke kaaran lahore main uski jeevanalila kaa ant ho gaya
 Even in India, there was no decrease in his self-respect
 uski kushagra buddhi, vakpatutaa evam vyangapriyata ne logon ko usase rusht kar diya tha
 Although his talent could not be fully developed due to his untimely death, as a poet he gained popularity both in Iran and India during his lifetime
 uski adhik prasiddhi kaa kaaran uske kaside the jinaki joardaar bhashaa, naveen tathaa moulik vaakyanshon kii rachana, prakarnon kii krambaddhata tathaa nae alankaaron evam naveen upamaaon ne use ek nai rachanastyli kaa avishkaarak bana diya
 The Ghazals of Urfi could not get much fame but he was proud of his Ghazals
 gajalon main darshanik vichaaron tathaa ucch aadarsho kii kavyamay abhivyakti uski rachana kii mukhya visheshta he
 His independent expression and his religious generosity have made his Ghazals very interesting
 uski rachanaayen sarvapratham 1587-88 i
 sankalit huin
 The compilation consisted of 26 pieces, 270 ghazals and 320 lions' katya and 380 lions
 usne kuch masanaviyon tathaa sufi mat ke atmasambandhi siddhanton kii vyakhya karte hue 'nafasia' naamak gadhy kii ek pustak kii bhi rachana kii thi
 The oldest Jain temple in Delhi is located opposite the Red Fort and Chandni Chowk

 Currently its building is made of red stones
 isliye yah laal mandir ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 There are many temples here but the most prominent temple is that of Lord Mahavira who was the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism
 yahaan jain dharm ke pratham tirthankar bhagwaan adinath kii pratimaa bhi sthapit he
 This place is very popular among the followers of Jainism
 yahaan kaa shant vaataavaran logon kaa apni ore khinchataa he
 Temples of temples were not allowed to be built in the Mughal Empire
 isliye is mandir kaa koi aupchaarik shikhar nahin tha
 Later this temple was revived after attaining independence
 sankaran vah prakriya he jisamen do padap yaa do alag-alag jati ke jantuon main nishechan karakar nayaa padap yaa nayaa jantu utpann kiya jaataa he
 The offspring produced by this process are called hybrids
 chaaku yaa chura yaa churi ek kaatane vaala auzaar hota he jisamen ek yaa ek se adhik kaatane vaali dhar hoti he
 There is usually a handhold for holding knives by hand, although this is not necessary
 chaaku maanvon dwaara bahut prachinkaal se istemaal hote aaye hai or itihaaskaaron ko kuch chaaku-numa aujaaron ke 25 lakh varsh se bhi puraane avshesh mili hai
 Humans were first made of cut stones by dicing them, but later the use of metals became common
 samajikaran vah prakriya he jiske madhyam se manushya samaaj ke vibhinn vyavhaar, reeti-rivaaz, gatividhiyaan ityadi sikhta he
