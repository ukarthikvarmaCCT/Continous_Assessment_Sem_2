 Along with Karl Marx and Max Weber, he is also said to be the chief architect of modern social science and the father of sociology
 david emil durkhime ko aadhunik samajashaastra kaa sansthaapak or samaaj-vaigyanik shabdaawalee main duniya kaa pehla adhikarik samajashastri mana jaataa he
 He was also the first professor of sociology in the university system of study
 apane academik jivan ke teen dashakon main unhone samajashaastra ko na keval ek vishisht anushaasan ke rup main sthapit kiya, balki is anushaasan kii saidhantik or paddatigat jameen bhi taiyaar kii
 Durkheim's Bill of Sociological Concepts considers humans to be the result of social relations
 is kaaran durkhime kaa samajashaastra apane buniyadi dhaanche main vyaktvaad ke kisi bhi rup ko manyata dene se inkaar karata he
 Durkheim Comt, Marx, Weber etc
 sit close to social thinkers in the context of considering human rights as the product of society
 gauratlab he ki vyakti ko samaaj kaa utpaada maananaa or saamaajik parighatna ko kendriya mahatva dena hi samajashaastra ko anya anushasano kii tulana main ek vishisht swaroop pradaan karata he
 This distinction of sociology was not possible without Durkheim
 haalaanki durkhime ne montescue or ruso jaise vichaarkon se lekar vyavahaarwad, samaajwaad tathaa naitik shiksha jaise masalon par bhi saghan chintan kiya he, parantu samajashaastra ke kshetra main unki chaar rachanaaon— 'da divizan of lebar', 'da rules of sosiolgical mathed', 'suiside' tathaa 'da alementary forms of da relijas life' ko sabase zyaada mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 David Emile Durkheim was born in a French Jewish family of Epinal, Lorraine
 unke pita or dada donon hi rabbi the
 His early education was also in a religious school, but at the very beginning of his life he decided to live a completely secular life
 ek adhyavsaayee chaatr ke rup main unhone vikhyath echol normel superioyre main daakhila liya or 1886 main apni doctoret ke ansh ke rup main unhone 'da divizan of lebar in socity' kii rachana kii
 In this work, Durkheim shows the difference between modern and traditional societies, suggesting that while modern society is based on the specialization of labor, traditional society runs on shared beliefs
 unke mutabik samaaj ke roopon kaa yah antar niyamon kii vyavastha ke antar ko bhi darshata he
 In this way, modern society is governed by self-regulation, whereas the rules of traditional society are based on external beliefs and approval
 durkhime ke anusaar chunki saajhe vishwaas sarvamaanya naitikta ke praadhikaar par tike hote hai isliye in vishwaason par aadhaarit vyavastha shakti or dabaav ke jariye hi kaayam rah saktaa he
 Whereas self-regulatory or modern society cannot be balanced without elements like freedom, equality and justice
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki saamaajik roopon kii vividhta ko niyamon ke vishisht dhaanche se jod kar dekhne kaa yah sutrikaran aparaadh or kanoon ke samajashastreey adhyayanon ke liye buniyadi prerak tatva rahaa he
 Durkheim believed that due to confusion in traditional and modern forms of society and the tendency to impose traditional laws or rules on modern societies, it has been responsible for many social problems
 aadhunik samaajon kii yah vyakhya durkhime ke krititv kii vishisht uplabdhi maani jaati he
 In this composition, Durkheim also analyzes the social association or affiliation of a person and holds the view that a person needs special social companionship
 durkhime dikhaate hai ki saamaajik sansthaaon ke andar swatah hi ek sansakti kaa tatva hota he jo apane sahabhaagiyon se ek nishchit vyavhaar kii maang karata he
 Durkheim therefore stressed that social processes should be studied instead of individuals
 unke anusaar in saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa thos rup sansthaaon or vyavhaar main abhivyakt hota he jinka anuvikshan ke aadhaar par bhi adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Durkheim calls these processes social factors or social facts
 durkhime ko samajashastreey adhyayan main sankhyikee ke sarjanaatmak upyog karne kaa shrey bhi jaataa he
 In this regard, his creation Suicide is set as a standard
 is kriti main durkhime ne yah pratipaadit kiya tha ki aatmahatya kii alag-alag daron kii vyakhya vyakti ke saamaajik sambaddhta ke staron main pragat antar ke aadhaar par kii ja sakati he
 For example, he showed that it is not possible to guess why older men commit suicide based on the individual's personal tendencies
 lekin agar vyakti kii saamaajik sthiti ke karkon jaise uske avivaahit hone yaa samaaj se uske algaav aadi par dhyaan diya jaae to aatmahatya ke kaarnon kii shinaakht kii ja sakati he
 Durkheim uses statistics in his studies to reveal the strength or character of social facts such as forms of mutual association of members of a group
 masalan, agar kisi samooh main aapasi saahchary kii bhaavana kamazor he to uske sadasyon main naitik yaa manovaigyanik samasyaayen paye jane kii sambhaavna zyaada hogi
 Conversely, if there is a deep feeling of companionship in a group, then its members will be more willing to sacrifice for their group
 durkhime kii anya kriti 'da rules of sosiolgilakal mathed' samajashaastra main prayukt kii jane vaali paddatiyon kii aadharbhumi maani jaati he
 Durkheim in this work makes it clear that the central theme of sociology is social system, so it should give priority to institutional and systemic forms of society rather than individual
 is rachana main durkhime samajashaastra ko aise hi saamaajik tathyon kaa adhyayan bataate hai
 According to him, there is a special kind of consistency between these social facts which cannot be called just the accumulated result of their constructive parts
 apni rachana suiside main durkhime isi bindu ko spasht karnaa chaahate the ki aatmahatya jaisi nijee parighatna ko bhi logon ke saahchary-sambandhon tathaa saamaajik banding ke aadhaar par vyakhyayit kiya ja saktaa he
 He argued that things like personal feelings, values or thoughts actually originate from social participation
 durkhime kii do rachanaayen 'da divijan of lebar' tathaa 'da alementary forms of da relijas life' tatkaaleen saamaajik vyavastha kii padtaal main aadhunik upagamon kaa istemaal karne ke liye jaani jaati he
 In the sociological discourse of modernity, both these works remain an essential reference even today due to their fine and intensive study
 durkhime kaa chintan gahare arth main aadhunik tha
 Even psychoanalysts like Fried were not free from the prejudices of their time and compared primitive brains to mental patients in his work Total and Taboo, while Durkheim proposed in his work Elementary Forms of the Religious Life that logic Thus, the social structures and beliefs of primitive tribes cannot be undermined by the rationale of modern man
 durkhime ke samay main vyaapt raajnneetik duragrahon ko dekhte hue yah ek saahasik vichaar tha
 Since Durkheim considers logic to be a social product, he rejects the idea that proves humans to be inferior or superior
 durkhime ke is hastkshep ne samajashaastra ko ek buniyadi samtawaad se las kiya he
 In considering the social utility of religion in the above work, Durkheim argues that human participation is an understanding of the basic forms of human reasoning - space, time, classification, power, work and reason only through participation in religious customs and rituals
 Earns a sense of wholeness
 is rachana main durkhime yah vichaar bhi pesh karte hai ki pavitrataa kaa saamaajik anubhav saamaajik antahsambandhon ko janm detaa he
 According to him, the birth of a social person and the development of reasoning is also canceled by this process
 is rachana main durkhime yah bhi kehete hai ki samast avadharanaon kii utpatti samaaj se hi hoti he
 Therefore, in order to develop an understanding of logic, language and meaning, it should be studied in which social forms and contexts words and concepts have been used
 yahan durkhime dharm ko samaaj kaa prakaarya bataate hue ek or ahm sutrikaran karte hai ki dharm saamaajik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhane kaa madhyam he
 Durkheim does not directly deny the truth of religious beliefs, but for him the truth of religion is determined by his ability to encourage rituals or not
 unke anusaar sangathit dharmon ko keval vishwaason ke aadhaar par nahin samajha ja saktaa kyonki is tarah ke dharm aksar samaaj ke parmparik roopon ko akshunn rakhane ke liye vyaktigat aasthaa kaa daman karte hue bhi paye jate hai
 Durkheim's formula regarding the role of religion in modern and traditional societies is also worth considering that the functions of religion are not the same in these two different varieties of society
 parmparik samaajon main to dharm saamaajik niyantran kaa aujaar hota he jabaki aadhunik samaajon main uskaa yah prakaarya gair-zaruri ho jaataa he kyonki aadhunik samaajon main vah gyaan-mimasaa kaa prakaarya nibhaane lagata he
 That is why his role in the social system is not the same as before
 durkhime kii yah nishpatti samajashastreey chintan ke lihaaz se ek uplabdhi kahi jaaegi ki manushya ke ek jaivik praani se saamaajik praani main roopantarit hone kii parighatna ko vyakti kii jaivik kshamtaaon yaa manovigyaan ke aadhaar par vyakhyayit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He argues that the conversion of biological to social is accomplished through social processes
 isliye durkhime ko lagata he ki man or sharir ko do alag iyatta qaraar dene vaala mat keval samaaj kii prakriya se baahar khadey jaivik astitv or saamaajik praani kaa antar darshata he
 According to him the first stage creature cannot be called a rational human being
 ve is baat par bhi jor dete hai ki manushya main tarkbuddhi yaa vyaktitv jaisi chizein samaaj kii prakriya se hi paidaa hoti hai
 Durkheim believed that to maintain a human being as a social animal, social processes and special forms of association are needed
 yani saamaajik manushya ko uske nishchit saamaajik vinyas or sandarbh se alag hataakar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Therefore Durkheim warns that if any method of study of psychology, economics or philosophy undertakes to understand social phenomena only on the basis of the accumulated activities of individuals, then it should be held guilty of bypassing the most important aspect like society
 hgfrtewxurkzaima ke chintan or krititv main samtawaad kii spasht pratishtha ke baavjood nariwadi vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki unhone striyon ke mudde par paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya he
 To a certain extent, it is true that as a sociologist, no work of Durkheim is concentrated on the female side
 lekin unnisvin sadi ke jis daur main durkhime samajashaastra ko vyavasthit kar rahe the us samay striyon ke prashnon par bahut kam saamaajik chintak vichaar kar rahe the
 In Suicide, he mentions a fatalistic type of suicide, which he mainly associates with women
 durkhime kaa khyaal yah bhi tha ki vivaah purushon ke liye to laabhakaari hota he lekin striyon ke jivan par uskaa nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 In The Division of Labor, Durkheim refers to the indigenous people, stating that the social status of women in such communities was not inferior to that of men, whereas female status in modern societies has become weaker
 tatkaaleen samaaj kii ausat pravriti stri ko komal or kamazor ke rup main chitrit karti thi
 In view of this, Durkheim's vision will surely be called as pioneer
 durkhime kaa avdaan samajashastriyon kii kai pidiyon ke liye prerana, prashnankan, samaveshan or jirah kaa vishay rahaa he
 In the thirties, Talcott Parsons attempted to assimilate Durkheim's work into structural functionalism
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki america main durkhime ke avdaan ko prakaaryawad or pratyakshthawaad ke najaariye se dekha jane laga
 While in France, his vision was used by anthropologists such as levi-strauss who were interested in creating a symbolist anthropology based on the concepts, ideas, and interrelationships of society, as propounded by Durkheim
 lekin durkhime ke vichaaron ko aadhaar banaakar nayi vyakhya karne kaa yah upkram is myne main ekangi sabit hua ki usne durkhime kii mul prastaavnaon ke kuch nishchit hisson kaa hi istemaal kiya
 Marxist stream sociologists have attempted to counterbalance Parsons' approach by emphasizing the radical nature inherent in Durkheim's thinking in his writings, which emphasizes the proving of Durkheim as politically conservative
 samajashastriyon ke ek samooh kaa maananaa he ki durkhime kaa samajashaastra vyakti ko gaun kar detaa he
 But if we look carefully, Durkheim does so intentionally
 unki drushti samaaj ko multah samuhikta main samajhane kaa aagrah karti he tathaa is baat par jor detii he ki agar saamaajik siddhanton kii padtaal or samajashaastra ke vyavhaar main antarvirodhon ke adhyayan ko tavajjo na dekar use vyaktvaad kaa paryaay bana diya jaataa he to samajashaastra kaa buniyadi uddeshy nirast ho jaataa he
 Durkheim's task of sociology is not to provide raw material for philosophical research and then wait for what the philosopher's vision says in his assessment
 iske barakes, durkhime yah israar karte hai ki samajashaastra ko saamaajik tathyon ke adhyayan sambandhi kasautiyon kaa nirmaan khud karnaa chahie
 He rejected the argument of philosophers that social facts have an element of contingency
 is aalochana kaa suchintit jawaab dete hue durkhime ne kaha ki samaaj kii nirantarata banaaye rakhane ke liye kuch khaas tarah ke or sthaayee rup zaruri hote hai

 ‘dhaatu’ shabd sabhi shastron main atyant mahatvapurn he
 The word 'dha' is derived from the word 'dha' in metal
 vyakaran main ‘dhaatu’ kaa arth he - ‘jisase shabd nishpann hota he’
 Maharishi Panini has mentioned about two thousand dhatus
 bhashaa kaa mul beej ‘dhaatu’ he
 vata-pitta-kapha has been called 'dhatu' in Ayurveda, which has created the entire living body
 ayurveda main prayukt datu ko dekha nahin ja saktaa, parantu inamen se kisi ek main bhi vikaar hote hi use ham anubhav karte hai
 In the human body, 'oz' is referred to as 'metal'
 yah sharir ke mul beej kaa ghatak he jinhen ham satva-raj-tam bhikehte hai
 They also cannot be seen, but in practice, one quality is developed
 Similarly, the essence of all the instruments used in the playing of the veena is 'metal'
 prabandh ke avyav ko bhi dhaatu kaha gaya he
 In the context of classical music, 'metal' has been used in various special meanings such as the element metal of the arrangement, the metal used in various instruments, the metal in the context of the speech, the metal in the context of the musical act, etc

 This word is used in many ways - mulya vardhit kar, yaa vastu or seva kar ek upbhog kar he, kisi bhi mulya par jo ek utpaada main jodi jaati he
 VAT, unlike sales tax, is neutral with respect to the number of routes between the producer and the end consumer; Where sales tax is levied on the total price at each stage, the result is a step
 waite ek apratyaksh kar he, is rup main ki kar ko aise kisi se ekatra kiya jaataa he jo kar kaa puraa kharch nahin uthaata
 Maurice Louré, the joint director of the French tax authority, Direction générale des impôts was the first to introduce VAT on 10 April 1954, although the concept was proposed in 1918 by German industrialist Dr
 Wilhelm von Siemens
 shuru main bade paimaane ke kaarobaaron par lakshyit, samay ke saath sabhi vyavsaayik kshetron ko shaamil karne ke liye iskaa vistaar kiya gaya
 In France, it is the most important source of finance for the country, contributing 52% of the country's revenue
 utpaadon or sevaaon ke nijee antim upabhokta, kharid par waite ko vasuul nahin sakate, lekin udyog un maal or sevaaon par jinhen ve aage kii aapurti yaa seva pradaan karne ke liye kharidte hai, jise sidhe yaa paroksh rup se antim upyogkarta ko bechaa jayega, waite ko vasuul sakate hai
 In this way, the total tax levied at each level in the economic chain of supply is a constant fraction of the value that a business adds to its products and much of the cost of tax collection is borne by the business rather than the state
 waite kaa avishkaar isliye kiya gaya kyonki bahut adhik bikri karon or shulkon ne dhokhadhadi or taskari ko protsaahit kiya
 Critics say this leads to an inconsistent tax burden on middle-class and low-income households
 mulya yojit kar, utpaadan ke har charan main yojit mulya par kar laga kar bikri kar ke sopan asar se bachaata he
 Value-added taxation is being preferred worldwide instead of the traditional sales tax
 siddhant rup main, mulya yojit kar un sabhi vanijyik gatividhiyon par lagu hote hai jisamen maal kaa utpaadan or vitaran tathaa sevaaon kaa praavdhaan shaamil hota he
 In each transaction of a business, VAT is evaluated and collected on the value added to the goods

 In many developing countries like India, sales tax / VAT is an important revenue source as high unemployment and low per capita income make other income sources inadequate
 haalanki, kai up-rashtriya sarkaron dwaara iskaa virodh hota he chunki isse unke dwaara ekatrit kul rajasav sangrah main kami hoti he saath hi saath swaittata kaa kuch nuksaan bhi hota he
 Sales taxes are usually levied only on final sales to consumers: because of reimbursement, VAT has the same overall economic impact on final prices

 When there is some exemption in the VAT system, if any, as with GST in New Zealand, it becomes even easier to pay VAT
 ek saamaanya aarthik vichaar yah he ki yadi bikri kar 10% se adhik ho jaataa he to log bade paimaane par karapavanchan gatividhiyon main lipt ho jate hai 
 The total VAT rate, on the other hand, may exceed 10% without extensive evasion due to innovative collection systems
 tathaapi, kyonki apane sangrah kii vishesh vyavastha ke kaaran, waite kaaphi aasaani se vishisht dhokhadhadi kaa nishaanaa ban jaati he jaise carozal frod jo rajyon ke liye kar aamadani main kami ke maamle main bahut mahangaa ho saktaa he
 The standard method for applying VAT is the principle that a business retains a percentage of the product minus the price previously paid
 yadi waite dar 10% he, to ek santare kaa ras nirmaataa prati galen keemat £5 ke 10% ko santare ke kisaan dwaara purv main bhugtan kiye gaye kar se gata kar degaa 
 In this example, the orange juice producer would have a £ 0
30 tax liability
 prayek vyavsaay ke aapurtikartaaon ke liye apane karon kaa bhugtan karne ke liye ek majboot protsaahan hota he, jisase ek khudara bikri kar kii tulana main waite dar, kam kar chori ke saath oonchi ho jaati he
 Behind this simple principle are variations in its implementation, as discussed in the next section
 sangrah kii paddati se, waite lekha aadhaarit yaa bijak aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Under the invoice method of collection, each seller imposes a VAT rate on their product and gives the buyer a special invoice indicating the amount of tax levied
 kharidaar jo apni bikri par waite ke daayre main hai, in bijkon kaa prayog waite kii apni dendaree ke prati ek credit praapt karne ke liye karte hai
 The difference between the tax shown on the invoice passed and the invoice received is then passed on to the government
 lekha aadhaarit tareeke main, aisa koi vishesh bijak prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Instead, the tax is calculated at the value added, which is measured as a difference between revenue and allowable purchases
 adhikansh deshon main aaj bijak vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, ekmaatr apwaad he japan jahaan lekha paddati kaa upyog karata he
 By the time of collection, VAT can be either accrual or cash based
 nakad aadhaarit lekhankan, lekhankan kaa ek bahut hi saral rup he
 When a payment is received for the sale of an item or service, an accumulation is made and the revenue is recorded at the date of receipt of the funds - no matter when the sale was made
 check tab likhe jate hai jab bill dene ke liye dhan uplabdh ho or vyay ko check kii taarikh main darj kiya jaataa he - isaki bina parvaah kiye ki kharch kab kiya gaya
 The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank and the secondary focus is on ensuring that all bills have been paid
 rajasav ko us samay avadhi ke saath jab unhen arjeet kiya gaya, tulana karne main adhik prayaas nahin kiya jaataa, yaa kharchon ko us avadhi se milan karne main jab unhen vyay kiya gaya
 Accrual based accounting matches the revenue from the period when they were earned and the expenses for the period when they were incurred
 haalanki yah nakadi aadhaarit lekhankan se zyada jatil he, yah aapke vyavsaay ke bare main adhik jaankaree pradaan karata he
 The accrual basis enables you to track receivables and payables
 prodbhavan aadhaar aapako unhen kamaane main kiye gaye vyay ke liye rajasav ke milan main madad karata he, aapako or adhik sarthak vittiya report detaa he
 Consider the manufacture and sale of any item, which we would call a widget in this case
 ek 10% bikri kar ke saath: Hence the consumer paid 10% extra as compared to the zero tax scheme and the government collected this amount
 khudara vikreta ne tex main sidhe kuch nahin khoyaa or khudara vikritaon ko atirikt kagaji karrwai kerani hoti he taaki unke dwaara ikattha kiye gaye bikri kar ko sahi dhang se sarkaar tak pahunchaaya ja sake
 Suppliers and manufacturers have the administrative burden of supplying the right certificate and checking that their customers are not consumers
 10% waite ke saath: That is, the consumer paid 10% extra as compared to the zero tax scheme and the government collected this amount in taxation
 kaarobaar ne kar main sidhe kuch nahin khoyaa
 They do not require a request for a certificate from buyers who are not end users, but they will have to do additional accounting so that they can correctly differentiate between the government, what they collected from VAT and what they spent in VAT
 Can give dhyaan den ki prayek maamle main pradutt waite, laabh yaa yojit mulya ke 10% ke baraabar he
 The advantage of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that the industry cannot hide consumption, proving that it is not a consumer
 uparokt udhaaharan main, hamane mana ki kar kii shuruuaat se pehle or baad main vijet kii utani hi sankhya main nirmaan hua or bikri hui
 This is not true in real life
 aapurti or maang ke mul tatv sujhaate hai ki koi bhi kar kisi ke liye lenden kii keemat ko badha detaa he, chaahe vah kreta ho yaa vikreta
 keemat main badhotaree se yaa to maang vakr baayi taraf jaataa he, yaa aapurti vakr upar kii taraf
 donon hi kaaryaatmak rup se baraabar hai
 As a result, the quantity of goods purchased decreases and / or the price it is sold increases
 upar ke udhaaharan main aapurti or maang kaa yah badlaav shaamil nahin he, saralata ke liye or kyonki ye prabhaav har prakaar kii vastu ke liye bhinn hai
 The above example assumes that the tax is non-distortable
 baaki sabhi karon kii tarah, ek waite, iske bina hota, ise viroopit karata he
 Because the price for someone increases, the quantity of goods decreases
 tadnusaar, kuch log adhik dwaara badtar ho jate hai jahaan sarkaar kar kii aay se behatar ho jaati he
 That is, the supply and demand change leads to a far greater loss than the tax benefits
 ise dedwet haani ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Income lost by the economy is higher than government income; Tax is disabled
 sarkaar kii aay kii puri raashi ho saktaa he ek dedwet draig naa ho, agar kar rajasav ko laabhadaayak kharch ke liye istemaal kiya jaay yaa sakaaratmak bahyata ho - duusare shabdon main, sarkarein bas kar aay kaa upbhog karne kii bajaay kahin adhik kuch kar saktin hai
 While distortions occur, consumption taxes, such as VAT, are often considered better because they distort incentives to investment, saving and working less than most other forms of taxation - in other words, rather than producing a VAT Discourages consumption
 upar chitra main, The "value added tax" has been criticized since its burden depends on consumers of personal end products and is therefore a regressive tax, although it should be understood that all company taxes ultimately arrive as a tax on consumers
 bachaav pakshon kaa daawa he ki aay ke madhyam se karadhaan ko nikaal dena ek manamaana maanak he or mulya yojit kar vastav main ek anupatik kar he or isamen adhik aamadani vaale log adhik bhugtan karte hai usee dar par jis par ve khapat adhik karte hai
 Both measurements make VAT more regressive than making it a progressive income tax
 ek waite pranali kaa prabhavi pratigaami gun, bad bhi saktaa he kyonki maal ke vibhinn virgon par alag-alag daron se kar lagaae jate hai
 Therefore VAT is mostly a flat tax and in practice can be regressive
 ek mulya yojit kar se praapt rajasav aksar apeksha se kam hote hai kyonki ve kathin hai or unka prabandhan or sangrah karnaa mahangaa hota he
 In many countries, where collection of personal income tax and corporate profit tax has historically been weak, VAT collection has been more successful than other taxes
 waite kai kshetradhikaron main or adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he chunki vyapaar udaarikaran ke kaaran tarriff str duniya bhar main gira he or anivaary rup se waite ne khoye hue tarriff rajasav ko pratisthapit kiya he
 The distortion of cost and value added tax is less than the high import duty of economic inefficiencies and enforcement issues, but it is disputed by principle that value added taxes are far more effective
 kuch udyogon main waite kaa adhik parihaar paaya jaataa he, vishesh rup se jahaan nakad lenden prabal hota he or ise badhaava dene ke liye waite kii aalochana kii ja sakati he
 From the government's point of view, however, VAT may be better because it can hold at least some value additions
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek badhai nakadi ke liye ek grihaswami ko, jo aamtaur par ek input waite kaa waapas daawa nahin kar saktaa, sevaayen uplabdh kara saktaa he 
 Therefore the homeowner will incur lower costs and the carpenter may avoid other taxes
 sarkaar ko, tathaapi, abhi bhi kai anya input ke liye jo badhai ko bechaa gaya he waite praapt hoga or badhai in input par waite ko punah praapt karne main asamarth hoga
 While the total income will be lower than that of full compliance, it will not be less than the income under the other probable taxation system

 VAT that is levied by a business and paid by its customers is called "output VAT"
 praapt aapurtiyon par ek vyavsaay dwaara anya vyavsaayon ko diya jane vaala waite "input waite" kehalaata he, 
 Typically an industry can recover input VAT to the extent that the input VAT can be declined at its taxable output
 input waite ko output waite ke vipareet sthapit karke vasula jaataa he jiske liye vyavsaay kaa sarkaar ke khate main hona aavashyaktaa he, yaa, agar vahaan ek aadhiky he, to sarkaar se ek chukauti kaa daawa karte hue
 According to the VAT Directive, some goods and services should be exempt from VAT and some other goods and services should be exempt from VAT but the option of VAT on those supplies should be subject to an EU member state

 On the other hand, the introduction of VAT would result in a revenue deficit for states and a reduction in their autonomy with greater centralization
 " chanchal kumaar sharma jor dekar kehete hai: "raajnneetik majaburiyon ne sarkaar ko waite kaa ek asangat model pesh karne ke liye prerit kiya" 'bhartiya waite pranali apurna' he, is had tak ki yah 'waite ke mul siddhanton ke khilaaf jaati he'

 The question is, in the case of a typical purchase and sale, can there be more production tax than investment tax? Can production tax be higher than investment tax when purchases are consistently higher than sales? If a VAT trader balances his purchases and sales, can there be a net tax for the state? Is there a mathematical model or model that can give credit returns to value added tax and which can reduce the percentage of credit returns? There are no ready answers to these questions

 Modulation is the process of distinguishing one waveform from another waveform
 doorsanchaar main adhimishran kaa istemaal sandesh bhejne ke liye hota he, lekin ek sangeetkaar swar-saamanjasy ke liye kisi vaadyayantra ke swar kii maatra, uskaa samay yaa timming or swaraghaat ko alag karne main iskaa upyog karata he
 Often high frequency sinusoid waveforms are used as carrier signals for low-frequency signals
 sin wave ke teen pramukh maapdand hai - uskaa apana aayam, uske charan or uski aavriti, ek modulated singnal praapt karne ke liye in sabhi sanchaar sanket ko kam frequency ke aadhaar par sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 The device which performs modulation is called modulator and the device which performs the opposite action is called demodulator
 jo upkaran donon hi tarah kaa kaary kar saktaa he vah modem kehalaata he 
 The purpose of digital modulation is to transfer digital bit streams to an analog passband channel, for example; Public switched telephone networks, or transfers over a limited radio frequency band
 anuroop adhimishran kaa uddeshy ek anuroop besaband sanket ko hastantarit karnaa he, udhaaharan ke liye ek audio sanket yaa tivi sanket ko ek anuroop pasband channel par hastantarit karnaa he, doosraa udhaaharan radio frequency band yaa cabel tivi network channel ko simit karnaa bhi he
 Analog and numerical modulation simplifies frequency division multiplexing, while simultaneously transferring multiple low-pass information signals via separate passband channels via a shared physical medium
 ankiy besaband adhimishran pranali, jo ki line koding kehalaata he, kaa uddeshy bhi ek ankiy bit stream par besaband channel ko, ek serial bas yaa taar dwaara jude local aria network jaise non filter-tambe ke taar ke jariye hastanantarit karnaa he
 The purpose of a pulse modulation system is to transfer a narrowband analog signal, for example a call call coming to a wideband baseband channel, or in some schemes the beat stream to another digital transmission system
 anuroop adhimishran main, anuroop information sanket par adhimishran lagaataar chalata rahata he
 Common analog modulation techniques are as follows: ankiy adhimishran main, anuroop vaahak sanket ek ankiy bit pravaah ke jariye adhimishrit hota he
 The digital modulation method can have digital-to-analog conversion and demodulation or detection can be analog-to-digital conversion
 vaahak sanket main parivartan m vikalp pratikon ke ek parimit sankhya se chune jate hai
 a common example: a telephone line is designed to transfer audible sound, for example take a tone, it is not numeric bits
 computer isiilie telephone main modem ke jariye sampark sthapit kar saktaa he, jo ankiy bits kaa pratinidhitiv tone, jise pratik kehete hai, ke dwaara karata hai
 If there are four choice symbols, the first symbol can represent bit sequence 00, similarly the second one on 01, the third 10 and the fourth 11
 If a modem plays music with 1000 tones per second, its symbol rate is 1000 symbols
 / Per second, or baud
 Since each tone in this example represents a message with two numeric bits, the bit rate is twice the symbol rate i
e
 2000 bits per second
 ankiy sanket kii ek paribhaasha ke anusaar, adhimishrit sanket ek ankiy sanket he, lekin ek anya paribhaasha main adhimishran ko ankiy se anuroop ke roopantaran bhi kaha gaya he
 In most textbooks, the digital modulation scheme is synonymous with data transmission as digital transmission, in very few textbooks it is called analog transmission
 atyaadhik moulik ankiy adhimishran takanic is prakaar hai: In QAM, an infinite signal and a quadrature phase amplitude are expressed in a finite number
 ise ek tu-channel pranali ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, harek channel ASK kaa upyog karata he
 The resulting signal is equivalent to a combination of both PSK and ASK
 uparokt sabhi paddati main harek charan, aavruti yaa aayam ek adbhut dohare beats ke pattern dwaara tay hote hai
 Typically, each phase encodes the same number of beats of frequency or amplitude
 is bits kii sankhya main shaamil pratik kaa pratinidhitiv vishesh charan dwaara hota he
 If the alphabet includes m = 2 n { \ displaystyle m = 2 ^ {N}} as an optional symbol, each symbol represents a message of n bits
 yadi pratik dar f s { \ displaystyle f_{s}} pratik prati second he, data dar n f s { \ displaystyle nf_{s}} beats prati second he
 For example, an alphabet that has 16 optional symbols, each symbol represents 4 bits
 isliye data dar bod dar se chaar guna hoga
 In PSK, ASK or QAM, where the carrier frequency of the modulated signal is constant, the modulation alphabet often simply represents the zodiac, the i signal of the amplitude for each signal representing the x-axis and the q signal by the y-axis

 The following are the common steps useful for transmitting data by a modulator: resiver kii ore se aamtaur par di-modulator nimna kaary karata he: It is common in all digital communication systems that both the modulator and the de-modulator must be designed simultaneously
 Numerical modulation schemes are possible because both the sender-recipient parties must know in advance how to encrypt the data and how to represent the communication system
 In all digital communication systems, both the modifier of the sender and the de-modulator of the receiver are designed in such a way that they can work with each other in addition to their work

 However, they only work with relatively stable amplitude modulation signals such as angular modulation and CDMA, but not with QAM and OFDM
 Although the switching amplifier is also completely unsuitable for a common QAM group, the QAM modulation principle is often used to allow switching amplifiers to run with these fms and other waveforms, and sometimes QAM de-modulation uses these switching
 This is done to get the signal by the expanders

 Due to the interdisciplinary nature of environmental science, expert teams conduct joint work together, usually conducting environmental research or details of environmental impact, as required under the US National Environmental Policy Act or governmental laws
 chunki zyaadaatar paryaavarniya mudde maanviya gatividhiyon se sambandhit hote hai, atah paryaavarniya vigyaan ke saath aksar arthshaastra, vidhi or samaaj-vigyaan vishyon kaa adhyayan bhi karaayaa jaataa he
 Environmental science covers issues such as climate change, conservation, biodiversity, groundwater and soil contamination, use of natural resources, waste management, sustainable development, air pollution and noise pollution
 haalanki paryaavaran kaa adhyayan kam se kam tab se to karaayaa hi ja rahaa he, jab se vigyaan kaa adhyayan ho rahaa he lekin 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main paryaavarniya vyavastha kaa adhyayan ek sthai or sakriy vaigyanik anveshan ke kshetra main ubharkar saamne aayaa he
 This was necessitated because the need of a large multidisciplinary team for the analysis of serious environmental problems was realized and there was a growing awareness of the public about sustainable environmental laws and the environment required for specified environmental investigations to address environmental problems

 inke kaaran graahakon ko kai baar pareshaani uthaani pad jaati he
 Sometimes fake notes come out from the machine and sometimes without the note, the blank receipt of the withdrawn rupees shows out

 Apart from this, some recent incidents of theft of ATM machine itself have been heard
 inke kaaran chori yaa lut kaa alarm na bajnaa yaa mashin ke taar kaate jane par switch yani control room ko khabar bhi na lag paanaa aadi hai
 The ATM machine breaks its contact with the switch when it is open for repair
 aise samay bank adhikari yaa atm vainder ke saamne mashin kii aavashyak marammat kii jaati he
 But even in the case of ATM machines' chests or chests being open, these machines remain online giving false message to the switch
 yani aisa sambhav he ki mashin chor le jaaen or switch ko khabar bhi na lage
 Many times fake notes come out of an ATM machine and the bank is not ready to take any responsibility for them
 kai baar jab atm mashin khate se rupee to nikaale dikhaa detii he lekin nakadi mashin se baahar nahin aati yaa kabhi kam hi nikaalati he

 graahak shikaayat sankhya lekar maansik tanaav grast ho isse kahin behatar he ki bank main jaakar chack se apni raashi nikaale or in jhanjhaton se mukt rahe
 Often it is clearly written on the application of ATM card and Internet banking that the bank will not be responsible for any kind of loss
 hekking or password chori main bankkarmiyon kii sanliptata ke maamle bhi ab khulne lage hai
 Customers cannot cancel their lost ATM card at their bank
 bank daawa karata he ki aap kisi bhi shakha se atm card jari karvaa sakate hai, lekin yahi card kho jaae to pehle bank ke kaal centre main isaki shikaayat darj karaani he
 The bank has to take the complaint number and inform it
 khoe hue atm card se nakadi nikaalane ke alaava khariddaari bhi sambhav he so graahak chahta he ki turant use khoe card se mukti milani chahie
 If the ATM card is used incorrectly, then the customer can also get the police or court office closed

 From this point of view, these machines cannot be considered safe for banking
 galat bhugtan kii pravishtiyon ko thik karne kii vyavastha bhi kargar nahin he
 Sometimes the machine keeps making noise, the money does not run out and the ATM hangs
 kabhi yah raashi kisi duusare graahak ko anayas hi mil jaati he kyonki raashi bich main ataki rahati he or atm achaanak kaam karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 Sometimes the same amount of the customer also gets in the hands of the people of the company feeding cash, paper or ribbon in the ATM
