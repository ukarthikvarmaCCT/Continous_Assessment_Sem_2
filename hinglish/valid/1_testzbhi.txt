 Certain types of Bills can be introduced only after receiving the recommendation of the President or any further action can be taken on them
 jaisaa ki iske naam se pataa chalata he, rajyasabha rajyon kii parishad he
 It represents the people indirectly
 rajyasabha ke sadsy kaa chunaav rajya vidhaan sabhaaon ke chune hue vidhayak karte hai
 The number of representatives of each state depends mostly on its population
 is prakaar,chhattisgarh ke rajyasabha main 5 sadsy hai, uttar pradesh ke rajyasabha main 31 sadsy hai
 Manipur, Mizoram, Sikkim, Tripura etc
 are only one member of smaller states
 rajyasabha main 250 tak sadsy ho sakate hai

 aarambh main yah aarakshan das varsh ke liye tha
 Under the latest amendment, it is now for fifty years i
e
 2000 years
 bharat main sadan kii karyavadhi paanch varshon kii he
 The House itself is dissolved when the five-year period ends
 kuch paristhatiyon main sansad ko purna karyavadhi samaapt hone se pehle hi bhang kiya ja saktaa he
 Parliament can extend the term of the Lok Sabha in case of emergency
 yah ek baar main ek varsh se adhik nahin ho sakati
 The two Houses of Parliament enjoy equal powers and status in all areas except in certain cases
 koi bhi gaiyr-vittiya vidheyak adhinium banane se pehle donon main se prayek sadan dwaara paas kiya janaa aavashyak he
 The Rajya Sabha has the same powers as the Lok Sabha in important matters such as impeachment of the President, removal of the vice-president, amending the Constitution and removal of judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts
 raashtrapati ke adhyadeshon, apaat kii udghoshnaa or kisi rajya main sanvaidhanik vyavastha ke vifal ho jane kii udghoshnaa or kisi rajya main sanvaidhanik vyavastha ke vifal ho jane kii udghoshnaa ko sansad ke donon sadanon ke samaksh rakhana anivaary he
 Disagreements between the two Houses on any other Bill except a Money Bill and a Constitution Amendment Bill are resolved by both Houses in a joint sitting
 is baithak main maamle bahumat dwaara tay kiye jate hai
 The Presiding Officer of such a meeting of both the Houses is the Speaker of the Lok Sabha

 Finally, it is necessary for him to resign as soon as he loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha
 sansadeey shashan kaa arth hona chahie sansad dwaara shashan
 But the Parliament does not govern itself nor can it
 mantriparishad ke bare main ek tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki yah sansad kii mahaan karypalika samiti hoti he
 Who is entrusted with the responsibility of governing on behalf of the parent body
 sansad kaa kaary vidhaan bananaa, mantranaa dena, aalochana karnaa or logon kii shikayaton ko vyakt karnaa he
 The executive's job is to govern, although she governs on behalf of the Parliament
 bharat jaise bade or baari jansankhya vaale desh main chunaav karana ek bahut bada kaam he
 An independent Election Commission has been set up to ensure that elections to both houses of Parliament - Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha - are unhindered and fair
 lok sabha ke liye saamaanya chunaav jab uski kaaryvadhi samaapt hone vaali ho yaa uske bhang kiye jane par karaae jate hai

 After the notification is issued, the Election Commission sets dates for filing nomination papers, scrutinizing them, withdrawing them and voting
 lok sabha ke liye pratyaksh chunaav hone ke kaaran bharat ke rajya kshetra ko upyukt pradeshik nirvachan kshetron main baanta jaataa he
 One member is elected from each parliamentary constituency
 yadi ek sadan kaa koi sadsy duusare sadan ke liye bhi chun liya jaataa he to pehle sadan main uskaa sthaan us tithi se khaali ho jaataa he jab vah anya sadan ke liye chunaa gaya ho
 Similarly, if he is also elected as a member of a State Legislature, if he does not resign from his place in the State Legislature, within 14 days from the publication of the proclamation in the State Gazette, the Parliament The member is no more
 yadi koi sadsy, sadan kii anumati ke bina 60 din kii avadhi tak sadan kii kisi baithak main upasthit nahin hota to vah sadan uske sthaan ko rikt ghoshit kar saktaa he
 Further, a member has to vacate his place in the House if yadi kisi sadsy ko samvidhan kii dasvin anusuchee ke upbandho ke antargat dal-badal ke aadhaar par ayogy siddh kar diya gaya ho, to us sthiti main bhi uski sadsyta samaapt ho sakati he

 lok sabha kii pehali baithak shapath vidhi ke saath shuru hoti he
 Its newly elected members take an oath 'to have reverence and allegiance to the Constitution of India', 'to keep the sovereignty and integrity of India intact' and 'to devoutly discharge the duties of a Member of Parliament'
 raashtrapati samay samay par sansad ke prayek sadan ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karata he
 After the last date of each session, the President has to invite the Houses for the meeting for the forthcoming session within six months
 yadhyapi sadanon ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karne kii shakti raashtrapati main nihit he tathaapi vyavhaar main is aashay ke prastaav kii pahal sarkaar dwaara kii jaati he
 There are usually three sessions or sessions of Parliament every year
 yatha bajet adhiveshan, monsoon adhiveshan or sheetakaaleen adhiveshan 
 But, in the case of Rajya Sabha, the budget session is divided into two sessions
 in do adhiveshnon ke bich teen se chaar saptaah kaa avkaash hota he
 Thus, there are four sessions in a year of Rajya Sabha
 raashtrapati kaa abhibhaashan The president is elected following the oath of newly elected members
 iske baad, raashtrapati sansad bhawan ke kendriya kaksh main ek saath sansad ke donon sadanon ke samaksh abhibhaashan karata he
 The President's address is a very important occasion
 abhibhaashan main aisi nitiyon evam kaaryakramon kaa vivaran hota he jinhen aagaamee varsh main kaaryrup dene kaa vichaar ho
 Also, a review of his activities and successes of the first year is also given
 vah abhibhaashan chunki sarkaar kii niti kaa vivaran hota he ant: sarkaar dwaara taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Addressing is discussed very widely
 dhanyavad prastaav ke sanshodhano ke dwaara un maamalon par bhi charchaa ho sakati he jinka abhibhaashan main vishesh rup se ullekh na ho
 The Lok Sabha elects two members of the House as Speaker and Deputy Speaker
 kuch aisi parampara bani he ki upaadhyaksh vipaksh ke sadasyon main se chunaa jaataa he
 It is often the effort of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman in the Rajya Sabha to conduct the proceedings of their House in an orderly manner
 sansadeey kaary do mukhya shirshon main baanta ja saktaa he
 Government work and non-government work
 sarkari kaary ko phir do shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he, The work of non-official members, that is, Bills and Resolutions, is discussed on every Friday or any day which the Speaker determines for two and a half hours
 sadan main kiye jane vaale vibhinn kaaryon ke liye samay kii sifarish saamanytah kaary mantranaa samiti dwaara kii jaati he
 There is usually a meeting every week
 sansad ke donon sadanon kii kaarywahi kii chhapi hui pratiyaan saamanytah baithak ke baad ek maas ke andar uplabdh kara di jaati hai
 The proceedings are tape-recorded
 vaad vivaad ke adhivationavaar chape hue khand hindi tathaa angreji bhashaa main uplabdh hote hai
 The government is responsible to the Parliament for every mistake it makes and to the people through Parliament
 sadan ke sadsy is adhikaar kaa prayog, anya baton ke saath saath, sansadeey prashnon ke madhyam se karte hai
 Members of Parliament have the right to ask for information from the Ministers of the Government on matters of public importance
 jaankaree praapt karnaa prayek gaiyr-sarkari sadsy kaa sansadeey adhikaar he
 It is necessary for a Member of Parliament as a representative of the people that he is aware of the activities of the Government to carry out his responsibilities
 prashn poochne kaa mul uddeshy lok mahatv ke kisi maamle par jaankaree praapt karnaa or tathy jaananaa he
 In both the Houses, questions are held for an hour at the beginning of each meeting
 or unke uttar die jate hai
 This is called the 'question Hour'
 iske atirikt, khoji or anupoorak prashn poochne se mantriyon kaa bhi pareekshan hota he ki ve apane vibhaagon ke kaarykaran ko kitna samajhate hai
 The Question Hour is the most interesting part of the proceedings of Parliament
 logon ke liye samachar patron ke liye or swayan sadasyon ke liye koi anya kaary itani dilchaspee paidaa nahin karata jitani ki prashnkaal paidaa karata he
 The atmosphere of the house during this period is uncertain
 kabhi achaanak tanaav kaa bavandar uth khadaa hota he to kabhi kahkahe lagane lagate hai
 Occasionally a question arises from a bitter argument
 aisi haalat sadasyon yaa mantriyon kii hajir-javaabi or vinodpriyata se dur ho jaati he
 This is the reason that during the Question Hour not only the House Room but also the audience and press galleries are almost always full
 kuch prashnon kaa maukhik uttar diya jaataa he
 These are called starred questions
 atarankit prashnon kaa likhit uttar diya jaataa he
 It can be said with certainty that members have been showing great interest in exercising their right to ask questions
 chunki prashnon kii prakriya apekshtah saral or aasaan he
 Therefore, it is becoming more and more beloved among Members of Parliament than other measures of parliamentary procedure
 sansad ke donon sadanon main prashnkaal ke thik baad kaa samay aamtaur par ‘shoonyakaal’ athwa jiro aavar ke naam se janaa jane laga he
 It is zero in more than one sense
 12 baje dopaher kaa samay na to madhyahn purv kaa samay hota he or na hi madhyahn pashchaat kaa samay
 'zero Hour' is also known as 'hour' due to its commencement at 12 o'clock because earlier 'zero Hour' used to run for a full hour, that is, until the house was recessed for dinner at 1 o'clock in the day
 yah koi nahin kah saktaa ki is kaal ke dauraan koun-sa maamla uth khadaa ho yaa sarkaar par kis tarah kaa akraman kar diya jaae
 There is no mention of 'zero time' anywhere in the rules
 prashnkaal ke samaapt hote hi sadsygan aise maamle uthaane ke liye khadey ho jate hai jinke bare main ve mahasoos karte hai ki kaarywahi karne main deree nahin kii ja sakati
 However, there is no provision in the rules for raising the case thus
 aisa prathit hota he ki is pratha ke peeche yahi vichaar rahaa he ki aise niyam jo rashtriya mahatv ke maamle yaa logon kii gambhir shikayaton sambandhi maamle sadan main turant uthaae jane main sadasyon ke liye baadhak hote hai, ve nirarthak hai
 In terms of rules, the so-called 'zero time' is an irregularity
 maamle chunki bina anumati ke yaa bina purv soochna ke uthaae jate hai atah isse sadan kaa bahumoolya samay vyarth jaataa he
 This leads to encroachment of legislative, financial and other routine work of the House
 ab to shoonyakaal main uthaaye jane vaale kuch maamalon kii pehle se di gai soochna ke aadhaar par, adhyaksh kii anumati se, ek suchi bhi banane lagi he
 The rules of both the Houses of Parliament provide for raising matters of public importance without delay and in many ways
 jo vibhinn prakriyaayein prayek sadsy ko uplabdh rahati hai ve is prakaar hai: By this, the matter of immediate importance can be discussed by stopping the regular work of the Lok Sabha
 iske dwaara koi bhi sadsy sarkaar kaa dhyaan tatkaal mahatv ke maamle kii or dilaa saktaa he
 The minister has to give a statement in that case
 dhyanakarshan karne vaale prayek sadsy ko ek prashn poochne kaa adhikaar hota he
 They can discuss questions of immediate importance for one hour
 haalaanki is par matdaan nahin hota
 How our elected representatives try to raise matters which have no relation to the interpretation of rules and regulations
 lekin ye maamle us samay unhen or unke nirvachan kshetra ke logon ko uttejit kar rahe hote hai
 The matters which are not questions of the system or which cannot be raised under the rules related to questions, short notice questions, call attention proposals, etc
, are raised under it
 sadan lok mahatv ke vibhinn maamalon par anek faisle karata he or apni raay vyakt karata he
 Any member can put a suggestion before the House in the form of a resolution
 jisamen uski raay yaa ichha di gai ho
 If the House accepts it then it becomes the opinion or wish of the entire House
 ant: mote taur par ‘prastaav’ sadan kaa faisla jaanane ke liye sadan ke saamne laayaa jaataa he
 The proposals are actually the basis of parliamentary proceedings
 lok mahatv kaa koi bhi maamla kisi prastaav kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 Proposals may be offered by different members for different purposes
 prastaav mantriyon dwaara pesh kiye ja sakate hai or gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon dwaara bhi
 The purpose of the proposals presented by non-government members is usually to know the opinion or views of the government on a matter
 sankalp bhi ek prakriyaagat upaay he yah aam logon ke hit ke kisi maamle par sadan main charchaa uthaane ke liye sadasyon or mantriyon ko uplabdh he
 Resolutions can be in the form of a declaration of opinion, or recommendation, similar to resolutions of the general form
 yaa kisi aise anya rup main ho saktaa he jaisaa ki adhyaksh uchit samajhe
 The Council of Ministers remains in office till it has the confidence of the Lok Sabha
 lok sabha dwaara mantriparishad main avishvaas vyakt karte hi sarkaar ko sanvaidhanik rup se pad chhodana hota he
 The rules provide for a motion to this effect called a motion of no confidence
 rajyasabha ko avishvaas prastaav par vichaar karne kii shakti praapt nahin he
 The motion of censure differs from the motion of no-confidence
 avishvaas ke prastaav main un kaarnon kaa ullekh nahin hota jin par vah aadhaarit ho
 But it is necessary to mention such reasons or allegations in the motion of condemnation
 yah prastaav katipay nitiyon or kaaryon ke liye sarkaar kii ninda karne ke iraade se pesh kiya jaataa he
 The censure motion is moved against the Council of Ministers or against any one minister or against some ministers
 usamen kisi mantri yaa mantriyon kii vifaltaa par sadan dwaara khed, rosh yaa aashcharya prakat kiya jaataa he
 Government has to do many tasks of governance, security and public welfare
 in sabake liye bahut saadhan chahie
 Where should he come from? The government collects taxes from the public
 jarurat padane par karje bhi leti he
 Because we live in a parliamentary system, it is necessary for the government to get the approval of Parliament before imposing any tax or incurring any expenditure
 is manjuuri ko lene ke liye hi har varsh sarkaar ek bajet yani puure saal kii aamadani or kharche kaa lekha jokha sansad main pesh karti he
 Rail budget and general budget are presented separately
 saamaanya bajet praayah farvari ke antim kaary diwas par laayaa jaataa he
 The railway budget comes a few days before that
 vittiya varsh is samay prayek saal kii pehali april se aarambh hota he
 It is proposed in the budget that how much money is to be spent on the item during the coming year
 usamen kitna dhan kis tareeke se aayega yaa kahan se jutaya jayega
 Grants are given for the coming year of the budget
 sarkaar ko apni vittiya or aarthik nitiyon tathaa kaaryakramon or unki vyakhya karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 At the same time, Parliament also gets an opportunity to consider and criticize them
 bajet paas karne kii prakriya main sansad ke donon sadanon main gambhir evam purna charchaa hoti he
 This happens a few days after the budget is presented
 charchaa saamaanya vaad vivaad se aarambh hoti he
 It lasts for three or four days in both houses of Parliament
 pratha yah he ki is avasthaa main sadsy sarkaar kii rajkoshiya or aarthik nitiyon ke saamaanya pahaluon par hi vichaar karte hai
 Do not go into tax and expenditure details
 is prakaar saamaanya vaad vivaad se prayek sadan ko apane vichaar vyakt karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 The government also realizes what will be the reaction to a particular proposal in later stages
 yah dhyaan dene kii baat he ki rajyasabha ko saamaanya charchaa ke alaava bajet se koi sarokaar nahin hota
 Voting on demands takes place only in the Lok Sabha
 duusari avasthaa anudaanon kii maangon par charchaa or matdaan kii he
 Normally, separate demands are placed for the proposed grants for each ministry
 in ‘maango’ kaa sambandh bajet ke vyay vaale bhaag se hota he
 Their form is that of the request made by the Executive to the Lok Sabha to be given the right to spend the amount demanded
 maango par charchaa ruchipurna hoti he
 During the discussions, the policies and activities of the Ministry are closely scrutinized
 anudaanon kii maangon ke mul prastaav ke sahaayak prastaav pesh karke sadsy aisa kar sakate hai
 These subsidiary proposals are called 'cut motions' in parliamentary language
 bajet paas karne kii prakriya bajet pesh kiye jane se is par charchaa karne or anudaanon kii maange sweekrut karne or viniyog tathaa vitt vidheyakon ke paas hone tak saamanytah chaalu vittiya varsh ke aarambh hone ke baad tak chalati rahati he
 Till Parliament approves the demands, it is necessary that the government has sufficient funds available to run the administration of the country
 isliye ‘lekhanudaan’ ke liye vishesh upbandh kiya gaya he
 By which the Lok Sabha has been given the power to grant advance grants for a part of a financial year till the completion of the budget process
 kanoon bananaa sansad kaa pramukh kaam mana jaataa he
 The initiative for this is mostly done by the executive
 sarkaar vidhaayi prastaav pesh karti he
 After discussion and debate on it, Parliament imposes its seal of approval on it
 sabhi kanoonee prastaav vidheyak ke rup main sansad main pesh kiye jate hai
 a bill is a draft legislative proposal
 vidheyak sansad ke kisi ek sadan main sarkaar dwaara yaa kisi gaiyr-sarkari sadsy dwaara pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus broadly, there are two types of Bills: Government Bills and Private Members' Bills
 vidhi kaa rup lene vaale adhikansh vidheyak sarkari vidheyak hote hai
 By the way, very few bills of non-government members take the form of law
 phir bhi unke dwaara yah baat sarkaar or logon ke dhyaan main laai jaati he ki maujuuda kanoon main sanshodhan karne yaa koi aavashyak vidhaan banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The draft of the Bill is prepared with the help of the Ministry of Law in the Ministry of Government related to that subject
 mantrimandal ke anumodan ke baad ise sansad ke saamne laayaa jaataa he
 It can be introduced in either of the two houses of Parliament by the Minister concerned
 keval dhan vidheyak ke maamle main yah pabandi he ki vah rajyasabha main pesh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Bill has to go through various stages in Parliament before it takes the form of an Act
 prayek vidheyak ke prayek sadan main teen vachan hote hai
 That is, first reading, second reading and third reading
 vidheyak ‘pesh karnaa,’ vidheyak kaa pehla vaachan he
 According to custom, this stage is not discussed
 vidheyak kaa doosraa vaachan sabase adhik vistrut evam mahatvapurn avasthaa he kyonki isi avasthaa main isaki vistrut evam baariki se jaanch kii jaati he
 When the House considers and approves all sections of the Bill and the schedules, if any
 tab mantri yah prastaav kar saktaa he ki vidheyak ko paas kiya jaae
 This is called the third reading
 jis sadan main vidheyak pesh kiya gaya ho usamen paas kiye jane ke baad use sahmati ke liye duusare sadan main bheja jaataa he
 There the bill then passes through all three stages
 kisi vidheyak par donon ke bich asahmati ke kaaran gatirodh hone par ek asaadhaaran sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 Which is resolved in the joint sitting of the two houses
 jab donon sadanon dwaara koi vidheyak alag alag yaa sanyukt baithak main paas kar diya jaataa he to use raashtrapati ke paas bheja jaataa he
 If the President grants permission, the Bill becomes an Act from the date of the assent
 sanshodhan ke dwaara samvidhan ke kisi bhi anuchhed main badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 But according to the decision of the Supreme Court, no change which can destroy or reduce the basic structure or fundamental elements of the Constitution can be made
 sansadeey visheshadhikaar ve vishisht adhikaar hai jo sansad ke donon sadanon ko, uske sadasyon ko or samitiyon ko praapt he
 Privileges are given with the view that both the Houses of Parliament, its committees and members can function independently
 unki garima bani rahe, parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki kanoon kii najaron main saadhaaran nagarikon ke mukaable main visheshadhikaar praapt sadasyon kii sthiti bhinn he
 As far as the enforcement of the statutes is concerned, the members are representatives of the people as well as ordinary citizens
 mul vidhi yah he ki sansad sadasyon sahit sabhi naagarik kanoon kii najaron main baraabar maane jane chahie
 The responsibilities which belong to other citizens also belong to them and perhaps there are some more as members
 sansadon kaa sabase mahatvapurn visheshadhikaar he sadan or uski samitiyon main puri swatantraaa ke saath apane vichaar rakhane kii chhot
 No action can be taken in any court against any matter said or given by a member of Parliament
 sansadeey visheshadhikaron kii suchiyaan taiyaar kii ja sakati hai
 In fact, they have also been prepared, but no such list is complete
 thode main kah sakate hai ki koi bhi vah kaam jo sadan ke, uski samitiyon ke yaa uske sadasyon ke kaam main kisi prakaar kii baadha daale vah sansadeey visheshadhikaar kaa hanan karata he
 For example, a member cannot be arrested not only when the House of which he is a member is in session or while the Parliamentary Committee of which he is a member is in the meeting, or both
 The joint sitting of the Houses is going on, or while the joint sitting of the two Houses is going on
 sansad ke adhiveshan ke prarambh se 40 din pehle or uski samaapti se 40 din baad yaa jabaki vah sadan ko aa rahaa ho yaa sadan ke baahar ja rahaa ho, tab bhi use giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Within the premises of Parliament, no legal or criminal 'summons' can be given without the permission of the Speaker / Chairman
 adhyaksh / sabhapati kii anumati ke bina sansad bhawan ke andar kisi ko bhi giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Because in the premises of Parliament only the orders of the House of Parliament or the Speaker / Chairman are followed
 yahan anya kisi sarkari praadhikari ke yaa sthaneey prashasan ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin hota
 Each House of Parliament is its own defender of privilege
 visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa sadan kii avmaananaa karne vaale ko bhartsana karke yaa taadna karke yaa nirdhaarit avadhi ke liye karawas dwaara dandit kar saktaa he
 In the case of its own members, the House can impose the other two types of punishment, that is, suspend and remove from service of the House, a member may be suspended from serving the House for a specified period
 kisi ati gambhir maamle main sadan se nikaala ja saktaa he
 The House may punish the offenders with imprisonment for a term which does not ordinarily exceed the duration of the session of the House
 jaise hi sadan kaa satravsaan hota he, bandi ko mukt kar diya jaataa he
 Due to the contempt of the House by the audience shouting slogans in the gallery and / or throwing advertisements, both houses have, from time to time, punished the offenders with imprisonment till the House adjourns on that day
 sadan kaa dandic kshetra apane sadanon tak or unke saamne kiye gaye aparaadhon tak hi simit na hokar sadan kii sabhi avmaananaaon par lagu hota he
 Whether contempt is committed by members or by persons who are not members
 isse bhi koi antar nahin padataa ki aparaadh sadan ke bheetar kiya gaya he yaa uske parisar se baahar
 This power of the House to punish persons for breach or contempt of privilege of the House is the foundation of parliamentary privilege
 sadan kii aisi panrapara bhi rahi he ki sadan kaa visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa sadan kii avmaananaa karne ke doshi vyaktiyon dwaara spasht rup se or bina kisi shart ke dil se vyakt kiya gaya khed sadan dwaara sweekaar kar liya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the House generally decides not to take further action on such matters in view of its dignity
 donon sadanon ke sadsy aise vetan or bhatte, jinhen sansad samay samay par, vidhi dwaara tay kare, paane ke hakdaar he
 The Parliament has approved the pension of Members under the Members of Parliament Act

 prayek sadsy 1500 rupaye pratimaas kaa vetan tathaa aise sthaan par, jahaan sansad ke kisi sadan kaa adhiveshan yaa samiti kii baithak ho, duty par nivas ke dauraan 200 rupaye pratidin kaa bhatta praapt karne kaa hakdaar he
 In addition to the monthly salary and daily allowance, each member is entitled to a constituency allowance of Rs 3000 per month and office expenses at the rate of Rs 1000 per month

 chosar ne koi nai bhashaa nahi gadhi, keval landan kii bhashaa par apni nijee chhap laga di
 It is difficult to determine the date of pre-verse verses
 unamem se kuch to pandulipiyon ke rup main vitarit kiye gaye the or kuch smriti evam maukhik paath ke aadhaar par chal rahe the
 From this one can think that these verses were mostly written in the 13th century and mainly in the second half of that century
 kabhi kabhi ham uske apratyaashit saundarya ke ek geet main ascharyajanak taazgi kaa anubhav karte hai
 like- Summer is a comen in londe sing cuckoo Some are completely different from the dark darkness of the anglo-saxon imagination
 yahi kuch aisi vastu he jo normanon ne england ko di-vah tha jeevanollas or thi nirikshan evam muulyankan kii kshamta
 The combination of Saxon ritualism and density with Celtic imagination and mysticism and then an affection for the Normans' love for the elements of life - these are the things that make England literature so great
 yah sab kuch bahut nishpraan rup main aayaa he, phir bhi isamen angrejon ke swabhaav ke ve pramukh gun abhivyakt hai jo unke sahitya main pratibimbit hote hai
 In the early stage of the mutual merger of the Normans and Saxons, the literature of the two was somewhat different from each other, or it may be said that they met in a rough way
 kintu willian ke purna hone ke turant baad hi kaaphi sankhya main lambii kavitaayen likhi gai
 The old Celtic stories, which belonged to King Arthur, became the great Arthur's Romantic literature in the French language
 sar gavaayan or "harith yoddha" jaisi romani athwa "moti" jaisi sundar komal vishay vastuvali evam karunapurna kavitaayen padhakar koi bhi yah anubhav karata he ki in kavitaaon ke, visheshat: arthur sambandhi romani kathaon ke madhyam se ek nae dhang kii rashtriyata abhivyakt kii ja rahi he
 King Arthur takes the form of a national hero

 Richard Roll was the eldest of the medieval mystics of England
 vah 1350 main chal basaa
 Most of the authors were from North or Marcia
 kintu ab ham landan ke abhyuday kaa dhanyavad die bina na rahenge
 The language of London became prominent and the names of these poets would be considered notable here: Lagland, Gover and Chaucer
 ye sabhi samasamyik the
 Although Lagland was more adult, he may have met most of the gover and chaucer, as London was then a vast and densely populated region
 kavi ke rup main lagland ne bahut kuch khoyaa
 His original talent and greatness was lost, as it seems, his manuscripts fell into his hands, it destroyed the original forms of the poems, and now only a very efficient editor can hope to give them the final pure form, because carefully On reading it becomes clear that the poet was omnipresent in his compositions and was completely devoid of repetitions and ruthless lines of waste Later, people had added
 doosraa dosha yah tha ki usne aangl-sackson chhandon ko, uski shleshatmakataa or balaghat ke saath grahan kar liya tha
 He felt very little that the ancient features of the anglo-saxon language were dying, so an emergency change in the language's design was necessary
 or yadi unka sahitya aaj utana nahin padhaa jaataa jitna padhaa janaa chahie, to uskaa kaaran keval unke chand hai jo pathakon ko apni saamaanya pahunch ke baahar prathit hote hai
 His syllogism does not have the power to speed up and bring glory
 gover main hamen aisi kaavyatmakataa kaa darshan hota he jo thodi gambhir he
 It had good speed in Latino, French and English
 dhyaan dene yogya mukhya baat yah he ki vah apni hi maatrubhaasha angreji main, jo ki us samay in teenon main sabase ashakt thi, vishwast nahin prathit hota he
 Although its English style is not as prasad and elegance as that of Chaucer, it is still simple and could have given similar creations if it had been a little too obsessed with "moral" assumptions
 phir bhi chosar kaa ek alag hi sansar tha
 He was probably much younger than Lagland, but seems to have lived in a different world
 lagland ek utprerit madhyakaalin kavi tha or chosar main aadhunik sahitya kii pehali vaastavik aawaaj thi
 It was indeed a long training period in which he followed the traditional Romanticism of the French verse
 francisi kaviyon, yatha jyaan da myung, gilem da laaris ko anudit kiya
 Boccashio followed the path of great Italian writers like Petrarch and Dante
 kintu in aupchaarik rachanaaon main bhi kuch aisi baaten thim jo kavi kii bhavi mahanata prakat karti thim
 It was not only that he used to make a simple eight-volume verse on a sample of the French verse, but also some kind of inspection or image, which also told what was going to be developed
 lekin cantarbari tels kii bhaanti moolyavaan saamagree inamen aprapya thi
 It was the first authentic thing of the modern era
 uskaa ek ansh hi kavi kii pratibha kaa dyotak he
 a common occurrence, such as the gathering of a group of yatris for a pilgrimage to Canterbury, seems to be very simple, which was also natural for medieval British pilgrims, but it is a beautiful selection of such subject and an example of fine art
 keval ek hi jhonke main chosar ne madhyakaalin england ke jivan kaa ek mahatvapurn ansh lekar or usamen swaabhaaviktaa tathaa naatakeeyata kaa niyojan karte hue aadhunik yugin dhang se use apni niraali style main udghaatit kiya
 In it, Chaucer portrays a large world
 in tirthayatriyon main aise stri purush hai jo apni ek sachhee pratikruti rakhte hai or ve swayan apane aap bhi waisi hi dridhtaa ke saath sachche hai
 It is a perfect mix in which the respected warrior, Susheela Prioress, the polygamous orator wife of the cunning physician Bath, the debater "cook", the lowly officer, the badass, the despicable "summon taker", the "cool friar" or Clark of Auxon Ford, true faith
 All are dissolved from the effervescent spirits
 vaividhya kaa kitna sundar saamanjasy he jo samast madhyakaalin england ke samaaj ko aisi spashtataa ke saath chitrit karata he jo sadaiv amar rahegaa
 What are the reasons for success of Chaucer? His great talent will be said in the north
 kintu mahaan pratibha ek bada golmol shabd he
 It contains innumerable qualities that do not match the imagination of the great genius of every new generation in exactly the same way
 mahaan pratibha apni kirane bhavishya ke garbh main phenkati he or uskaa sandesh is bhaanti sampreshit hota he ki log use puure taur se samaj nahi pate
 Therefore Chaucer adopted the language of the public unlike his contemporaries, but the choice of the new verse was contrary to the general interest
 usne sarvapratham francisi kaviyon kaa anukaran kiya or aath matraavaali dvipadiyon ko saraltapurvak likhaa
 But he knew that it did not fit with English, because such a small measure suited the French language talents and because he had a lot of relevance to the sound and omission of a vowel
 kintu aangl-sackson prishthbhumi ke naate angreji main gati laane ke liye kuch adhik sthaan kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Chaucer gave a verse called Pentameter which is a major achievement of English verse
 normanon ore sexno kaa parsparik vilyan sarvapratham chosar main hi parilakshith hota he
 In fact, he is the man of English who sang his songs in English, the new language of that period
 vitamin, poshak tatwon or urja antargrahan kii gambhir kami ko bhukhmaree kehete hai
 It is the most extreme form of malnutrition
 adhik samay tak bhukhmaree ke kaaran sharir ke kuch ang sthaayee rup se nasht ho sakate hai or antat mrityu bhi ho sakati he
 The term weathering refers to the symptoms and effects of starvation
 vishwa swasth sanghathan ke anusaar, vishwa ke sampurna swasth ke liye bhukh swayan main hi ek gambhir samasya he
 The WHO also states that so far malnutrition is responsible for half of the total cases of infant deaths
 eggeo ke anusaar, vartmaan main 1 billian se bhi zyada log, yaa is grah par prati chah main se ek vyakti, bhukhmaree se prabhavit he
 The root cause of starvation is the imbalance between energy expenditure and energy intake
 duusare shabdon main, sharir bhojan ke rup main grahan kii gayi urja se adhik urja vyay karata he
 This imbalance may be due to one or several medical reasons and / or may also be due to ecumenical conditions, which may include: chikitsakeey kaaran Circumstantial reason bhukhmaree se grasit vyakti main charbi kii maatra or mansapeshiyon kaa bhaar kaaphi ghat jaataa he kyunki sharir urja praapt karne ke liye in utakon kaa vighatan karne lagata he
 When the body begins to disintegrate its own muscles and other tissues to maintain the functioning of its vital organs like nervous system and heart muscle, it is called catabolitis
 vitamin kii kami bhukhmaree kaa saamaanya parinaam he, jo praayah khun kii kami, beriberi, pelegra or scurvy kaa rup le letaa he
 Jointly, these diseases can also be the cause of diarrhea, skin rash, edema and cardiac arrest
 iske parinamswaroop isse grast vyakti praayah chidchida or aalsee rahata he
 Stenosis of the stomach reduces the experience of hunger, as the experience is controlled by the part of the stomach that is empty
 bhukhmaree ke shikaar vyakti itane kamazor ho jate hai ki unhen pyaas kaa anubhav nahin ho paata or isliye nirjaleekaran se grast ho jate hai
 All actions become painful as a result of weathering of the muscles and dry and cracked skin, which is caused by severe dehydration
 kamazor sharir ke kaaran bimaariyaan hona saadhaaran he
 For example, fungus often develops inside the food pipe, making swallowing anything very painful
 bhukhmaree se hone vaali urja kii swaabhaavik kami ke kaaran thakaavat hoti he or urja kii yah kami lambe samay tak rahane par peedit vyakti ko udasin bana detii he
 Because the person suffering from starvation becomes so weak that he is unable to eat and move and then his interaction with the environment around him also starts to decrease
 vah vyakti rogon se ladane main bhi asamarth ho jaataa he or mahilaon main masikdharm bhi aniyamit ho jaataa he
 When food intake stops, the glycogen accumulated by the body is depleted within 24 hours
 sanchaarit insulin kaa str kam ho jaataa he or glucagon kaa str atyadhik batch jaataa he
 The major means of energy production is lipolysis
 glucogenesis glissrol ko glucose main badal detaa he or kori cycle lectate ko prayog yogya guocos main badal detaa he
 Glucogenesis has two energy systems: proteolysis gives alanine and lactate made by pyruvate, while acetyl coa is a soluble nutrient that can be detected by urine and used by the brain as a source of energy Let's go
 insulin pratirodh kii shabdaawalee main, bhukhmaree kii avasthaa main mastishk ke liye uplabdh glucose se adhik glucose banane lagata he
 Treatment of patients with starvation is possible, but it should be done with utmost care to avoid refeeding syndrome
 kisi vyakti ke liye, rokthaam main swaabhaavik rup se adhik bhojan lenaa sammilit he, is bhojan main itani vividhta ho ki vah poshan kii drushti se ek sampurna aahaar ho
 Sitting in front of a person suffering from a possible starvation, raising voice for social systems that deprive people of food, etc
 are more complex matters

 It has also been reported that the world already produces so much food that it can feed the entire population of the world - the total population of the world is 6 billion - while twice as many people produce food to feed it
 - 12 billion people
 However, agriculture is now largely dependent on the increasing use of inert mineral fuels and freshwater reservoirs; Istiuto Nezionale dela Nutrizione, a senior researcher from Rome and a professor at Cornell University's College of Life Science and Agriculture, estimated the maximum global population to be around 2 billion if it relied exclusively on only renewable sources

 Another daughter-in-law of Tiberias, named Agrippina the Elder, also died of starvation 33 BC
 haalanki yah spasht nahin he ki usne is prakaar bhukh se marane kaa nirnay swayan liya tha
 a son and daughter of Agrippina were also sentenced to starvation for political reasons; His second son, Drusas Caesar, was imprisoned in 33 BC and was tortured to death by Tiberius' command; Agrippina's youngest daughter, Julia Livilla, was banished to an island by her uncle, Emperor Claudius, in the 41st year, and shortly thereafter arranged to be starved to death by the Empress Messalina

 Factualism in seed form was present in the education of some ancient ideologues, but the credit of giving it the post of a philosophy branch is to Agastar Kant
 kamt ke siddhant main moulik sthaan maansik vikaas ke us niyam kaa he, jise usne aitihaasik rup main gyaan kii sabhi shakhaon par lagu kiya
 This is the rule of three floors or stages of mental development

 varnakrammapi vidyut chumbakeey varnakram ke ek vishisht bhaag ke liye prakaash kii visheshtayon ke maapan hetu upyog kiya janaa vaala yantra he jo aam taur par saamagree kii pahchaan ke liye spectroscopy vishleshan main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The variable measured is often the intensity of light, but it can also be a polarization state for example
 swatantra char aamtaur par yaa to prakaash kii tarang dairdhya yaa photone urja ke liye sidhe anupatik ek ikai hota he jaise wevanumber yaa electron volt jiskaa tarang dairdhya ke saath vyutkram sambandh hota he
 Spectrometer is used in spectroscopy to produce spectral lines and to measure wavelength and intensity
 spectrometer ek shabdaawalee he jo gamma rez or eks rez se lekar for infrared kii vyapak range ke tarang dairdhya par sanchalit hone vaale upkarnon par lagu kii jaati he
 If the region of interest is restricted near the visible spectrum, the study is called spectrophotometry
 saamanyat: koi bhi vishesh upkaran is purna range ke ek chote se hisse par sanchalit ho saktaa he aisa spectrum ke vibhinn bhaagon ko maapne ke liye istemaal kii jaani vaali takanic kii vajah se hota he
 Below optical frequencies, the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device
 spectroscops aksar khagol vigyaan or rasayan kii kuch shakhaon main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The former spectroscopes were simple spectra with gradual notation of wavelengths of light
 aadhunik spectroscops jaise monochrometars aam taur par ek vivartan jhanjhari, gatimay sankari daraar or kuch prakaar ke photoditactor kaa upyog karte hai ye sabhi swachaalit he or computer dwaara niyantrit kiye jate hai
 The spectroscope was invented by Joseph von Fraunhofer
 jab ek saamagree ko uddipti ke liye garam kiya jaataa he tab yah saamagree prakaash chhodti he jo saamagree ke parmaanu shringaar kii visheshta he
 Special light gives rise to sharply defined bands on the frequency scale that can be interpreted as fingerprints
 udhaaharan ke liye, sodium tatv main ek bahut vishisht dabl sodium pilaa band hota he jise 588
9950 or 589
5924 nenometers par sodium D-linon ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jiske rang se aisa koi bhi vyakti parichit ho saktaa he jisane kam dawaab kaa sodium vaashp lamp dekha ho
 In the original 19th-century spectroscope design, light enters the slit and a convolutional lens converts light into a thin beam of parallel rays
 prakaash phir prism se paas hoti he jo beam ko ek spectrum main mode detii he kyonki failaav ke kaaran vibhinn tarangadairya vibhinn maatra main mode di jaati he
 The image was then viewed through a tube with a scale that was transferred to the spectral image, enabling its direct measurement
 photographic film ke vikaas ke baad or adhik sateek spectrograph banaaya gaya tha
 It was based on the same principle as the spectroscope, but had a camera in place of the display tube
 haal ke varshon main photomultiplir tub ke aasapaas bane electronic circuit ne camere ko visthapit kar diya he, jo adhik sateekta ke saath vaastavik spectrographic vishleshan kii anumati detaa he
 In spectrographic systems, tables of photosensors are also being used in place of film
 aisa varnakrameey vishleshan, yaa spectroscopy, agyaat saamagree kii sanrachana kaa vishleshan or khagoleey ghatana ke adhyayan or siddhanton ke pareekshan ke liye ek mahatvapurn vaigyanik upkaran ban gaya he
 In modern spectrographs, the spectrum is usually given as photon numbers or watts and is displayed along the abscissa which is usually given as wavelength, wavenumber, or ev
 spectrograph ek upkaran he jo aavriti spectrum main aane vaali wave ko alag karata he
 There are several types of machines known as spectrographs based on the precise nature of the waves
 pehle spectrographs main detector ke rup main photographic paper kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 Star spectral classification and the discovery of the main sequence, Hubble's law and the Hubble sequence are all made of the same spectrographs that used photographic paper
 sanyantr rangadravya phaytokrome kii khoj aise spectrographs kaa upyog karke hui thi jo paudhon ko detector ke rup main istemaal karata tha
 The latest spectrographs use electronic detectors such as ccds that can be used for both visible and UV light
 detector kii sateek pasand ricard kii jane vaali prakaash kii tarang dairdhya par nirbhar karti he
 The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will include both a near-infrared spectrograph and a mid-infrared spectrometer
 ek achelle spectrograph do vivartan jhanjhari kaa upyog karata he, jinhen ek duusare ke sandarbh main 90 degree ghumaya jaataa he or ek duusare ke kareeb rakhaa jaataa he
 Hence the entry point and a 2D CCD chip are used, not a narrow crack, which records the spectrum
 aam taur par aisa sochaa jaataa he ki spectrum vikarn par praapt hota he, lekin jab donon jhanjhariyon main vyapak rikti hoti he or ek is tarah prajvalit hoti he taaki keval pehla kram dikhaai de or duusari is tarah prajvalit hoti he ki bahut se ucch kram pradarshit ho, is tarah ek choti si aam sisidi chip par acchhee tarah se muda hua bahut acha spectrum praapt hota he
 The small chip also means that statutory optics is not meant to adapt to astigmatic coma or need, but spherical aberration can be set to zero
 ek spectrograph ko kabhi kabhi monochromator ke ek saadrishy ke rup main policromator bhi kaha jaataa he

 Sadmukhyo Ramay jon flit ne 1888 i main uparokt lekh kaa angreji anuwaad kiya jo nimnlikhit he- "may he protect you, who is victorious, -dispelling the darkness of the banks of clouds with the masses of the multitude of his rays that light up the sky; decorating the top of the side of the mountain of dawn with horses, which have the tossing ends of manes deshevelled through the fatigue by startled gait; - who, -having chariot-wheels swallowed xxrep 4 


 
 the mountain of dawn; dispelling distress; the light of the house which is the world; effecting the destruction of night , -creates the fresh beauty of the waterlilies by rays which are of the color of molten gold! - a ruler of, of great merit, who was renowned by the name of the glorious Tôramâna; by whom, through heroism that was specially characterised by truthfulness, the earth was governed with justice
 -of him, the fame of whose family has risen high, the son he, of unequalled prowess, the lord of the earth, who is renowned under the name of Mihirakula, who, unbroken, Pasupati
 -while, the king, the remover of distress, possessed of large and pellucid eyes, is governing the earth; in the augmenting reign, in the fifteenth year, of the best of kings; the month Kârttika, cool and fragrant with the perfume of the red and blue waterlilies that are caused to blossom by the smiles of the rays of the moon, having come; while the spotless moon is shining; and a very auspicious day,-heralded by the chiefs of the classes of the twice-born with the noise of the proclamation of a holy day, possessed of the tithi and nakshatra and muhûrta,-having arrived;- -the son's son of Matritula, and the son of Mâtridâsa, by the name Mâtrichêta, an inhabitant of xxrep 4

 -as long as the moon shines on the thicket that is the knot of the braided hair of Sarva; and as long as the mountain Mêru continues to have slopes adorned by the feet of the nymphs of heaven; and as long as Vishnu bears the radiant Srî upon breast which is like a dark-blue cloud;-so long chief of -temples shall stand upon the delightful summit of the hill!" Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy
 bharat main krishi sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke daur se kii jaati rahi he
 After 1960, a new era came with the Green Revolution in agriculture
 san 2007 main bhartiya arthvyavastha main krishi evam sambandhit kaaryon kaa sakal gharelu utpaada main hissaa 16
6% tha
 At that time, 52% of all those working in agriculture were engaged
 bharat main krishi main 1960 ke dashak ke madhya tak paaramparik bijon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha jinaki upaj apekshaakrit kam thi
 They required less irrigation
 kisaan urvarkon ke rup main gaay ke gobar aadi kaa prayog karte the
 The use of high yield seeds started after 1960
 isse sinchai or rasinic urvarkon or kitnashkon kaa prayog bad gaya
 This agriculture began to require more irrigation
 iske saath hi gehun or chaaval ke utpaadan main kaaphi vriddhi hui jis kaaran ise harith kranti bhi kaha gaya
 Production of pulses and wheat in different years in India - bharat main krishi main paramparaagat aujaaron jaise fawda, khurpy, kudaal, hansiya, ballam, ke saath hi aadhunik mashiinon kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he
 Farmers use tractors for plowing, harvesters for harvesting and threshers for threshing
 2010 eggeo vishwa krishi sankhyikee, ke anusaar bharat ke kai taaja fal or subjia, doodh, pramukh masaale aadi ko sabase bada utpaadak tehraaya gaya he
 Fibrous crops like jute, many staples such as millet and castor oil seeds, etc
 are also produced
 bharat gehun or chaaval kii duniya kaa doosraa sabase bada utpaadak he
 India is the world's second or third largest producer of many things such as dried fruits, textile agro-based raw materials, roots and tubers crops, pulses, fish, eggs, coconut, sugarcane and many vegetables
 2010 may bharat ko duniya kaa pochava sthaan hasil hua jiske mutabik usne 80% se adhik kai nakadi fasalo kaa utpadan kiya jaise coffee or kapaas aadi
 According to the 2011 report, India was ranked fifth in the world, according to which it is the fastest growing livestock producer
 2008 ke ek report ne daawa kiya ki bharat kii jansankhya, chaaval or gehun kaa utpaadan karne kii kshamta se adhik teji se bad rahi he
 Other sources suggest that India can feed its growing population with Aram, as well as export rice and wheat
 bas, bharat ko apni buniyadi suvidhaon ko badhaana hoga jisase utpaadak bhi bade jaise anya desh brazil or china ne kiya
 India exported around 2 lakh metric tonnes of wheat and 21 million metric tonnes of rice in 2011 to Africa, Nepal, Bangladesh and other countries around the world
 jaleey krishi or pakad matsaypalan bharat main sabase teji se badhate udyogon ke bich he
 The Indian fish crop doubled between 1990 and 2010, while the aquaculture crop tripled
 2008 main, bharat duniya kaa chatha sabase bada utpaadak tha samudri or mithe pani kii matsay paalan ke kshetra main or doosraa sabase bada jaleey machhlee krishi kaa nirmaataa tha
 India exported around 6,00,000 metric tons of fish products to all the countries of the world
 bharat ne pichle 60 varsho main krishi vibhaag main kai safaltaae praapt kii he
 These benefits were mainly derived from the Green Revolution, power generation, basic amenities, knowledge improvement etc
 in India
 bharat main fasal paidaavaar abhi bhi sirf 30% se 60% hi he
 Agriculture in India still holds the potential for major productivity and total production gains
 vikasshil deshon ke saamne bharat abhi bhi peeche he
 Additionally, due to poor infrastructure and unorganized retail, India experienced some of the largest food losses in the world and suffered losses as well
 bharat main sinchai kaa matlab kheti or krishi gatividhiyon ke prayojan ke liye bhartiya nadiyon, talabon, kuon, naharon or anya kritrim pariyojnaon se pani kii aapurti karnaa hota he
 In a country like India, 64% of the cultivated land depends on the monsoon
 bharat main sinchai karne kaa aarthik mahatv he - utpaadan main asthirataa ko kam karnaa, krishi utpaadakta kii unnati karnaa, monsoon par nirbharta ko kam karnaa, kheti ke antargat adhik bhoomi laana, kaam karne ke avasaron kaa srijan karnaa, bijli or parivahan kii suvidha ko badhanaa, baadh or sookhe kii rokthaam ko niyantran main karnaa
 The level of investment required for the development of marketing, storage and cold storage infrastructure is estimated to be enormous
 haal hi main bharat sarkaar ne puri tarah se krishi kaarykram kaa moolyankan karne ke liye kisaan ayog kaa gathan kiya
 However, the recommendations have received only a mixed reception
 navambar 2011 main, bharat ne sangathit khudara ke kshetra main pramukh sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 These reforms included logistics and retailing of agricultural products
 yah sudhaar ghoshnaa pramukh raajnneetik vivaad kaa kaaran bhi bana
 This reform scheme was put on hold by the Government of India in December 2011

 In addition to Project Varsha, in 2009 Hindustan Shipyard Limited located in Visakhapatnam was transferred from Ministry of Shipping to Ministry of Defense to undertake the non-grade nuclear submarine construction program
 ye nae jahaaj ienes varsha par aadhaarit honge
 160 crore was sanctioned for the project in the 2011-12 budget, of which 58 crore was for civil works and the remaining 100 crore was for setting up a VLF communication system
 hardutt naam se madhyakaal main sanskrit ke anek vidwaan hue hai- Public literature means the literature that the folk creates
 lok-sahitya utana hi pracheen he jitna ki maanav, isliye usamen jan-jivan kii prayek avasthaa, prayek varg, prayek samay or prakruti sabhi kuch samahit he
 According to Dr
 Satyendra- "lok Man is that class of society which is void of the consciousness or arrogance of the classical culture and erudition and which survives in the flow of a tradition
 " Literature related to the general public should be called folk literature
 saadhaaran janajivan vishisht jivan se bhinn hota he at: janasahitya kaa adarsh vishisht sahitya se pruthak hota he
 The folklore of a country or region is a symbol of all those trends from the beginning to the present, which fall under ordinary public nature
 is sahitya main janajivan kii sabhi prakaar kii bhavanaayen bina kisi kritrimata ke samaai rahati hai
 Therefore, if you want to study the entire culture of somewhere, then you will have to do special observation of the folklore
 yah lipibaddh bahut kam or maukhik adhik hota he
 However, efforts have been made to script Hindi folklore for some years and many texts have also appeared in edited form, but oral oral literature is still largely unorganized
 lok jivan kii jaisi saralatam, naiysargik anubhutimayi abhivyanjana kaa chithran lokgeeton va lok-kathaon main miltaa he, vaisaa anyatra sarvatha durlabh he
 People's heart speaks in folk literature
 prakruti swayan gaati-gunagunaati he
 The evaluation of beauty inherent in folk literature is purely cognizant
 adikaal se shruti evam smriti ke sahare jivit rahanevaale loksahitya ke kuch vishesh siddhant hai
 In this literature, only those compositions are accepted or found to be life which, after being formed in many forms from many larynx, take a common form
 yah rachanakram adikaal se abtak jari he
 Many such literary material is still prevalent today, which has not yet acquired uniformity
 paramparaagat evam samuhik pratibhaaon se nirmit hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne loksahitya ko "apaurushey" kii sangya di he
 Certainly traditional folklore is not the result of any one person's creation
 vaise to iske kai pramaan die ja sakate hai ki ek hi geet, katha yaa kahawat ek sthal par jis rup main hota he duusare sthal par pahonchte-pahonchte uskaa vah rup badal jaataa he kintu ek acha pramaan yah hoga ki saikadon varsh se gaae janevaale lokmahakavy aalh-khand ko aaj tak ekarupata nahin praapt ho saki
 In this work, folk propagation does not accept any restriction
 sfoot geeton main to keval panktiyaan hi idhar udhar hoti hai kintu prabandh geeton evam kathaon main ghatnaayen bhi badalati rahati hai
 Despite all this, almost no change is accepted in the results of those arrangements and stories
 parinaam evam lokprachlit satya tathaa tathy ko aadhaar maanakar ghatnachakra manamaane dhang se chalaae jate hai
 Take the story of Ram
 "naanaa bhanti ram avtara, raamaayan sat koti apaara" vaali baat shat pratishat satya he
 If all of the variations related to Ramkatha are prevalent in the folklore, then if all of them are collected, then this strange type of "lokramayana" will be prepared which will be of a different existence from all the Ramakhyas till date
 ghatnachakron ko dekhte hue kabhi-kabhi to unki sangati baithaana bhi kathin ho jayega
 For example, in folklore, there are many reasons for the birth of Ram, but a very simple reason is that once when Maharaj Dasaratha was going to bathe in Saryu in the morning, he appeared early in the morning to Helin, who sweeps in the street
 usne taana maaraa ki aaj praat: kaal hi satanheen vyakti kaa darshan hua, pataa nahin din kaise beetegaa
 Dasaratha realized this and then he went to do penance in the forest for his son's attainment with the queen
 is prakaar kaaran doosraa dikhaate hue bhi lokkthakaar dasharath ko phir tapasyawale sthal par le aata he jahaan katha anya ramaayanon kii katha se mil jaati hai
 Many such examples can be found which are not in the result but not in the case of events
 aise parivartanon evam sanshodhano ko loksahitya bahut hi aasaani se sweekaar kar letaa he
 The biggest feature of this literature is that despite its many forms, it has a sense of unity in diversity
 bhashaa ke kalevar ko badalakar bhi bhavapaksh main koi parivartan nahin dikhta
 The same composition which is found in the dialect there at some place, is also found in the other dialect too far
 sfoot geeton ke bhaavon evam prabandhon kii kathaon kii yah yatra kabhi kabhi to itani lambii hoti he ki aashcharya hota he
 Even though humans may set the boundaries of regions and countries, public literature does not accept it
 aisa shaayad isliye sambhav hua hoga ki yatrakaal main pracheen maanav jab kabhi dur gaya hoga to apana sahitya saath letaa gaya hoga or gantavy sthaan par uski chhap chhod aayaa hoga jise vahaan ke logon ne sweekaar kar liya hoga
 This sequence continues even today
 jab koi gramya naihar se sasuraal jaati he to swabhaavat: vah naihar kii un lokrachanaon ko apane saath leti jaati hai jo use samaran rahati hai
 It does not matter if she is married in the dialect area of maike, but when married in another dialect area, she adapts the songs of Naihar to the accents of the local dialect
 us is kaary main sasuraal kii graamyaon dwaara bhi sahaayta milti he
 In this way, the spoilage continues to go on
 lokagayak evam gayikaon kaa yah swabhaav bahut dinon se chalaa aa rahaa he ki yadi unhen kisi kavi kii rachana pasand aa gai to use tod marodakar apni boli ke anukool bana leti hai
 While doing so, sometimes the poet's name is removed and sometimes he is allowed to remain
 pramaan ke liye aaj bhi aise loakgeet sune ja sakate hai - jo sur, kabir, tulsi evam mira ke prakashit granthon main jis tarah milenge lokgayakon ke kanth par unka vah rup nahin hoga
 In some folklore, their names have been spontaneously inserted
 yah pravriti hindi hi nahin anya bhashaaon ke loksahitya main bhi pai jaati he
 Some scholars say that such hymns and songs have been composed by the folk folk themselves and to increase their usefulness, the names of high and erudite poets were added so that most people remember such songs
 par yah baat he nahin
 The folk poet is moderate at this place
 aise bahut se bhajan lokajeevan main na jane kab se chale aa rahe hai jinke rachanakaaron ke bare main pataa hi nahin chalata
 The truth is that the number of such hymns is much more than the number of hymns and they are not inferior in name to the hymns
 lokgayakon kii ek pravriti yah bhi hoti he ki ve sthaneey ghatnaon ko turant bhavabaddh kar lete hai, jaisaa 1934 ke bihar bukamp ke samay hua tha
 Zonal narrative materials that have been around for a long time are the result of this trend
 ghatnapradhan prabandh evam lokkathaayen is pravriti se janm to paa jaati hai kintu deergh jivan maatr unako miltaa he jo janamanas ko adhik kushalta ke saath chooti hai
 The language of folk literature is not the elegant and literary language but the language of ordinary people and its content is limited to the characters, emotions and influences acquired in public life
 yah to lok-sahitya kii pehali maryaada hui
 Its second dignity is not the contribution of the individual but the entire society
 yahi kaaran he ki lok-sahitya par vyakti kii chhap na hokar samgr vyakti-lok kii chhap hoti he
 When we talk about these two main limitations when it comes to craftsmanship, then it becomes clear that no practice or skill for craftsmanship can be reflected in it, because if the law of craft shows us it is social Owing to the compulsion of harmony itself
 vaise prachlit arth main shilp-vidhaan kii baat yahan nahin uthaayi ja sakati he
 People understand that a pre-anxious trade is embedded behind the craft and since there is no possibility of such a trade in folk literature, there is no question of its craft
 par tattvik drushti se dekhne par shilp-vidhaan kaa arth he abhivyakti ko abhivyajya se jodna
 Craftsmanship in folk literature is at its peak, because it is here, at most, resolute, uninterested and disinterested
 lok-sahitya ke mukhyatah chaar bhed kahe jate hai; lok-geet, lok-gaatha, lok-katha or lok-natya
 The distinction between folklore and folklore is so much that folklore operates as a long narrative song and it has a rhyme-oriented rather than a management-narrative saga, while folklore being proselytizing -satha is predominant or in other words event-oriented
 lok-natya jansulabh rangamanch ko drushti main rakhkar angik or vaachik abhinay par aadhrut swang yaa lila tak simit rahata he
 It does not have the ability to make a lasting impact due to special attention being given to timeliness
 lok-kathaon or lok-gaathaon main katha-shilp hi pramukh rahata he, keval lok-gaan aisa prakaar he, jisamen apane samgr rup main shilp-vidhaan viksit ho saktaa he, in chaaron prakaar ke roopon main shilp-vidhaan ke ye ang samaan rup se apekshit hai
 Some of its special trends of folklore are as ancient as this ancient literature
 in pravritiyon kii pushti ko hi vishaal evam vibhinn rachana karaane kaa shrey he
 For convenience, they can be divided into the following types: adikalin maanav ke prakrutipradutt vibhinn kalyankari parinaamon se prabhavit hone ke kaaran unpar jo vishwaas aropi kiya isse sambhddha sahitya iske antargat aata he
 Both the feelings of devotion and fear are embedded in it
 devi devataaon kii puja ke liye rachit tathaa andhvishwaason se sambhddha sahitya isi ke antargat he
 Some of these beliefs are zonal and some are given wide importance
 sthaneey uplabdhiyon par sthaneey or vyapak par vyapak rachanaayen milti hai
 Mantras or songs prevalent on the earth, sky, well, pond, river, stream, deeh, doyara, mari masan, tree, crop, plant, animal, demon, demon, deity, totem, brahma and pilgrimage etc
 are part of it 
 jab bhi gramin koi shubh kaary prarambh karte hai to usase sambhddha devi-devataaon ko prasann karne ke liye jin geeton athwa mantron kaa prayog hota he ve sab is sahitya main aate hai
 For the diagnosis of diseases, instead of the songs and mantras of Oshadhi are used
 udhaaharan ke liye sheetala mata ke geeton ko liya ja saktaa he
 For different Gods and Goddesses, the contents of different mantras, songs, worship and indulgence etc
 have not been determined since when
 kisi ko kuch pasand hota he parantu brahm ko in sab ke sthaan par janeu chahie
 According to these songs and mantras change, as well as priests keep changing
 iske antargat aachaar vichaar evam vyaavhaarikta tathaa vibhinn lokmanyataon se sambhddha sahitya aata he
 There is a penetration of feelings and beliefs in literature composed for ethics, but this is rarely seen in literature composed for behavior
 vyavhaar kii visheshta loksahitya main mukhya rup se dekhne ko milti he
 Let us talk about mutual behavior
 yahan saanp ko bhi doodh pilaayaa jaataa he
 The tree is also called Baba and the transferee and rivers assume the form of sister
 isi tarah anek amanviya tatwon se tathaa hinsak jantuon se sambandh jodakar sari sristi ko ek rup main bandha gaya he
 In this context, the basic purpose of composed literature is to lead a simple and happy life on the basis of practicality
 yahi kaaran he ki janajivan ek rishte main bandhaa hua he or jaateey bhedbhaav, jo bheeshan rup se vyaapt hai, uski diwaar ko tod nahin sake hai
 The relationship of grandparents, siblings etc
 is carried out in the entire village without any caste discrimination
 vibhinn avasaron ke liye prachlit lokachar bhi isi vidha ke ang hai
 Under this literature, literature related to meteorology, health science, agronomy, and Shakun etc
 comes
 lokajeevan main is prakaar ke sahitya ko aadhunik vaigyanik yug main kaaphi mahatvapurn sthaan praapt he
 These include the experiences, rules set by the foregoing and preaching things related thereto
 yah manyataayen praaia: pariksha kii kasuti par khari utarati he kintu saath hi kuch apwaad bhi hai
 Under meteorology, indications have been made for the causes of hypertrophy, drought and hypoglycemia, and exudative losses and measures to avoid them
 is prakaar ke vaigyanik sahitya ke aadhaar paramparaagat anubhav hi hote hai
 Since those experiences are very strong, the chances of their becoming spoiled like in folk songs are less
 yahi dasha krishivigyaan ke liye rache gaye sahitya kii he
 Under this, essential things related to farming have been said
 khet kii jutai kis tarah ho, kis prakaar ke khet main kis prakaar kii buaai kii jaae, beej kii maatra kitni ho, sinchai kab kii jaae, nirvaahee evam gudayi kab kii jaae tathaa kis samay fasal kii kataai ho, yah sab baaten to vaigyanik sahitya ke antargat aati hi hai, inke atirikt fasal sambandhi rogon tathaa upachaaron kaa bhi varnan miltaa he
 a large amount of literature has also been written on the identification of equipment and bulls used in agricultural work
 belon ke atirikt anya paaltu pashupakshiyon ke bare main bhi prachur sanket milte hai
 Public literature after the bulls is received regarding the identification of horses
 chunki aadhunik vaigyanik vaahanon ke kaaran ab ghode kam rakhe jate hai isliye is prakaar ke sahitya kaa dhire dhire abhaav hota ja rahaa he
 With the arrival of tractors in the village, the literature written about the identity of bulls will probably be the same
 anya paaltu pashuon main gaay, bhens evam kutton kii characha aati he kintu inpar naam maatr ke liye sanket kiya gaya he
 In birds, signs about parrot, myna, crow, munis, peacock, cuckoo and pigeon etc
 are indicated
 graminon ke upyog main jitne prakaar ke pashupakshi aate hai un sabaki pahichaan evam unase honevaale laabehani ke bare main is sahitya ke antargat sanket praapt hote hai
 In health science, signs of various diseases and ways to avoid them and medicines are indicated
 koun sa rog kyon utpann hota he tathaa kin aacharnon se rog utpann nahin hota yaa dur ho jaataa he aadi baaten ise antargat aati hai
 Also, some orders have also been given for health care routines
 jadi bootiyon kii pahchaan, unke upyog tathaa isse utpann laabehani kii charchaan bhi is vibhaag ke vishay hai
 Such signs are often presented as commands and are in verse
 yahi vidha krishivigyaan evam shakunvigyaan ke liye rache gaye sahitya main bhi apanaai gai he
 In order to start the journey mainly in Shakun ideation literature, according to chronological auspicious signs, orders have been given or forbidden for yatra due to waste
 yadi yatra bahut hi aavashyak ho or dinon kii gananaa main uskaa samay anukool na padataa ho to usase vachane ke liye upaay bataae gaye hai
 Shakun ominous information is also given by the various antics of seasons, human traits and animal husbandry under this type of literature
 jaise varsha kaal main ghar nahin chhodana chahie, mundere par yadi praat: kaal kaag bole to use kisi priy jan ke aagaman kii soochna samajni chahie, ityadi
 There is a common form of total folk literature, but at the same time there is literature based on traditional culture of different castes
 inamen un jatiyon ke nijee devi devtaa, kul devtaa ke aadesh tathaa aacharyon evam sant mahatmaon dwaara bataae gaye niyam, upanium or unki vaani shaamil hoti he
 Different cultures of different castes like - Nai, Dhobi, Ahir, Chamar, Kurmi, Koyri, Noni, Bar, Bhat etc
 and wild and other castes are under the ethnic folk culture
 yadi yah kaha jaae ki kahin kaa sampurna loksahitya vahaan kii vibhinn jatiyon kii samuhik samskruti kaa pratik hota he or anupyukt nahin hoga
 The form of folklore that survives after the removal of ethnic literature will not be a true representation of it
 is sahitya kii rachnasthali vishisht sahitya kii rachnasthali se bhinn hoti he
 It is the specialty of folk literature that none of its forms are built in isolation
 praaia: ve sabhi sthal ukt sahitya ke rachanakendre hote hai jahaan samay samay par use premi athwa aavashyaktaaon se prerit graamy jan juta karte hai
 That is why it can never be said that the form of the part of folklore today was the same yesterday and will continue to be so
 yadi ham kahen ki loksahitya kii pramukh rachnasthali chaoupal evam aangan he to beja nahin hoga
 The villagers often congregate in the chaupalas at leisure
 tarah tarah kii baaten chalati hai
 Discussion of rituals, religion discussion, story-telling, farming talk and folk songs etc
 keep on chaupalas from time to time
 vartmaan kaal kii sthaneey pramukh ghatnaayen bhi kuch dinon tak vaarta ke liye aadhaar bani rahati hai
 The material that gets life in the form of all these squeezes, they join the local literature after a few days
 yadi mahatv adhik hua to aisi rachanaaon kaa prachaar bad jaataa he or ve ek chaoupal se duusari main tathaa ek gaanv ke duusare gaanv main jaakar apana kshetra vyapak banaati rahati hai
 In this way, those compositions get included in the store of elaborate folklore in a few years
 yahi baat ogan main rache gaye sahitya par lagu hoti he jahaan gramyaayein samay samay par ekatra hoti hai
 In this way, the literature of men and women is separate from birth itself
 chaoupaalon evam aanganon ke atirikt bhi kuch aise sthaan hai jahaan is sahitya kii vibhinn vidhaayen nirmit hoti hai
 While doing nirvah or katiyas in the fields, carrying the bundles of stalks, while doing other collective wages, in pilgrimage or fair journey, near evening bonfires in winter, during festivals and ceremonial events or in short, say that when and where rural women There is an opportunity for the mobilization of men and then there is the creation of folk literature
 aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki bhootkaal main rachaa gaya sabhi loksahitya jivit he or aaj jinka nirmaan ho rahaa he unka ant kabhi nahin hoga
 The truth is that the genres of this literature change their form by accepting the effect of age
 idhar pachaas varsh ke bheetar rache gaye sahitya ko dekhne se yah baat spasht bhi ho jaati he
 Most of the scientific achievements achieved by the villages during this period have been incorporated in public literacy
 pracheen loksahitya main aae jaadu ke udan khatole ko chhodkar is yug ke loksahitya ne sidhe sidhe hawaii jahaaj ko sweekaar kiya he
 By the way, vehicles such as bullock cart, horse, camel, elephant and boats are still alive in the folklore, but motor and train have also made their way
 vartmaan kaal main honevaale nav nirmaanon ko bhi ukt sahitya main sthaan miltaa ja rahaa he
 These literary works are also associated with all the characteristics which give them long life
 praaia: vidvan log yah kaha karte hai ki yadi vistrut loksahitya kaa sangrah nahin kar liya gaya to unka lop ho jayega
 This is true because due to the impact of the era, ancient creations seem inappropriate and then slowly disappear, as is happening at this time
 cinema ke geeton ne gaanvon main apana sthaan bana liya he jisase loakgeet kshinta ko praapt ho rahe hai
 Due to the spread of education, there is a lack of men and women singing songs in the dialects of villages
 aisa lag rahaa he ki kuch dinon main vibhinn sanskaron ke avasar par gaae janevaale pracheen lokgeeton kaa lop ho jayega or unke sthaan par naveen geet sthaan paayenge yaa yadi ichha hui to loksahitya ke sangrahon kaa dekh-dekh kar padhi likhi striyaan geet gaakar kaam chalaengi
 The flour grinder has reached the village tomorrow and many more instruments are proliferating, so "zantasar" and some other labor related songs are becoming scarcity
 isi tarah vartmaan yug kii ghatnaayen bhi isamen sweekaar kii ja rahi hai
 Rani of Jhansi, Kunwar Singh, Gandhiji, Subhash Chandra, Bhagat Singh, Khudiram and Chandrashekhar Azad etc
 are alive with reputation in folklore
 ye vir senaanee usee kadi main jode gaye hai jinamein pracheen kaal ke veeron ke naam aate hai
 From the above Viven, the place of folklore becomes clear, but this literature rising from the ground has also made its apex place where it has an equivalent posture of Vedic literature
 pramaan yah he ki hamaare lokajeevan ke bahut se or visheshkar saanskarik tathaa dharmik kaary vaidic mantron se purna hote hai
 While these mantras are recited in Sanskrit, other activities based on folk songs and ethos sung by the Gramyas continue
 ek or purohit mantracchar karata he to duusari or gramin striyaan geet gaati hai
 Mantan, Karnaveedh, Yajnopavit and marriage ceremonies and chanting of houses, Dharamshala, wells and ponds etc
 are also followed by chants and folk songs
 aisa ek hi saanskarik evam dharmik tathaa parmarth kaa kaary lokajeevan main nahin miltaa jisamen vaidic sahitya ke saath loksahitya ko sthaan na praapt ho
 Shiv Kumar sonpalli, ichchod mandal main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke adilabadu jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Prem Nath Dogra was a politician from India
 unhone jammu tathaa kashmir ke bharat main purna ekikaran ke liye bahut kaary kiya
 He was also the President of Bharatiya Jana Sangh
 ve praja parishad ke pehle adhyaksh the
 He is called 'sher-e-duggar'
 dogra kii doordarshee soch kaa hi parinaam tha ki 'ek vidhaan, ek nishaan or ek pradhan' kii maang par andolan kaa aagaaj hua
 As a result, strong relationships were established between the country, the center and the state

 Later he became the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Sanghchalak and then joined the Praja Parishad movement

 He remained dominant in Jammu politics till 1972
 pandit premnath dogra kaa janm 23 aktubar, 1894 ko samalpur gaanv main hua
 Samailpur village is 22 km from Jammu city
 Far from the jammu-pathankot route is a famous village in the north
 unke pitaaji kaa naam pan anant raay tha
 Pt
 Anant Rai was the Superintendent of the Ranvir Government Press at the time of Maharaja Ranveer Singh of Jammu and Kashmir and thereafter Superintendent of Kashmir Property in Lahore
 pandit ji tab raja dhyaan singh kii lahore kii haveli main rahete the
 At the same time, childhood and education initiation of Pt Premnath was also completed
 pandit premnath ji bachapan se hi padhai main atyant yogya or khelon main atyant chust evam nipun the
 In 1904, he passed the matriculation examination from Model School, Lahore and took admission in FC College
 vahaan unhone padhai ke saath-saath khelon main vishesh ruchi dikhaai or 100 gaj, 400 gaj, aadha mile, ek mile kii daud main pratham sthaan praapt kiya
 Also received a reward from the then Governor of Punjab, who was presiding over the event
 pandit ji ko ek jeb ghadi inaam main mili thi unhone us ghadi ko bahut dinon tak sambhaal kar rakhaa, aaj bhi vah unke parivaar ke paas surakshit he
 In college life, Panditji was also a high level player in football
 kalege kii footbal team main shaamil the
 Chetram Chopra, the then Governor of Jammu State, once said- "I think that the cause of Panditji's vigor and speed was the game of football, which had an impact till the last day in his life
" 1931 main jab maharaja ne sabhi ke liye dharmik sthalon ke dwaar kholane kaa aadesh diya to aapane apni atyant budhimata ke saath chuaachhut kii buraai ke viruddh safal sangharsh kiya or aise pag uthaae jinase tanaav kii sambhaavnaaen samaapt ho garin
 Pt
 Dogra became the Wazir Wazarat of Muzaffarabad in 1931, working in many places and high positions
 1931 main shaikh abdulla kaa 'kashmir chodo andolan' joro par tha
 Even in Muzaffarabad, there was a high probability of disturbing the peace, but Panditji did not show strictness towards the miscreants, did not lathi charge or shoot bullets, but acted with maleficence
 unhone kaha, sampradayikta ek aandhi he jisamen kai vyakti ulajh jate hai, parantu aise samay main daman chakra chalaane se sthiti bighad jaaya karti he
 If some affection is to be shown then what is the harm
 pandit ji ne bina lathi va bandook chalaaye updrav shant kar diya, parantu unki yah niti us samay kii sarkaar ko thik nahin lagi or isi vajah se sarkaar ne uske baad unako naukari se alag kar diya
 Sheikh Abdullah also came to Jammu in 1931
 vah jammu main dogra sadar sabha main bhi aaye
 At that time the president of Dogra Sadar Sabha was Sardar Buddha Singh
 vahaan shaikh abdulla ne kaha ki sarkaar ne pandit premnath dogra ko naukari se nikaalkar acha nahin kiya or unako naukari par dobaaraa lenaa chahie
 After leaving the government job, Pandit ji got involved in public service
 1940 main pandit ji jammu main praja sabha ke pehali baar sadsy chune gayi
 After that, he became more and more close to the people
 1947 ke dauraan desh vibhaajan ke samay jammu-kashmir main bada sankatpurna or bhayaavah raajnneetik maahaul bana tha
 Maharaja Harisingh had to go out of the princely state and here on the instigation of Jawaharlal Nehru, Sheikh Abdullah raised the slogan of "separate head, separate mark and separate legislation" according to his "new Kashmir" agenda and plow marks in place of Indian tricolor
 Wala began to wave the red colored flag of Kashmir

 premnath dogra ke netritv main praja parishad kaa gathan hua or ek desh main 'ek pradhan, ek nishaan or ek vidhaan kaa andolan' chhid gaya
 He was arrested in 1949
 unhen mukt karaane ke liye aandolan hua
 The slogan at that time was "open the prison doors, leave Panditji
 is andolan main pandit ji teen baar jail gayi or kaaphi dinon tak jail main rahe jahaan shaikh abdulla sarkaar ne unhen bahut ksht die
 His government pension was also stopped

 But on 23 June 1953, Dr

 After the death of Dr

 They were airlifted to Delhi Airport on the orders of the Central Government

 Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad was also present during that time
 pandit ji 1953 ke praja parishad ke andolan ke pashchaat desh bhar main ek rashtranishth rajaneta ke rup main ubharkar saamne aaye
 After this he was also the All India President of Jana Sangh for one year
 vah jammu kashmir ke ekmaatr aise netaa the jo kisi rashtriya dal ke adhyaksh rahe
 Since then no one has received this privilege
 1957 main jammu nagar kshetra se pandit ji pradesh kii vidhansabha ke sadsy chune gaye or 1972 tak har chunaav jitate rahe
 Regarding the referendum in Jammu and Kashmir, he clearly said that there was no mention of referendum in the merger letter
 riyasat ke sabhi netaaon or raajnneetik dalon ne, jinamein neshnal conference bhi shaamil thi, is vilay ko manyata de di thi
 After the elections, the Legislative Assembly headed by Sheikh Abdullah also considered the merger to be authentic, so it is not the job of a patriotic citizen to talk about public opinion
 21 march, 1972 ko apane nivas sthaan kachi chhavnee main desh ke is prakhar netaa evam raashtra kii akhandta ko samarpit jujharu vyaktitv kaa nidhan ho gaya
 There are many Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activists who worked with Panditji on many occasions, among them prominent are Kedarnath Sahni, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, Jagdish Abrol, Balraj Madhok, Shyamlal Sharma, Durga Das Verma, Chaman Lal Gupta, Sahadev Singh, Rajendra Singh, Mulakh Raj Pargal and Gopal Sachar
