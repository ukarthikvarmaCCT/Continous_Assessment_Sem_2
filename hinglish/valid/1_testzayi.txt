 jwalamukhi prithvi kii sataha par upasthit aisi daraar yaa mukh hota he jisase prithvi ke bheetar kaa garm lava, gas, raakh aadi baahar aate hai
 In fact, it is a fracture in the upper layer of the Earth through which the internal matter comes out
 jwalamukhi dwaara nicksruth in padaarthon ke jamaa ho jane se nirmit shankvakar sthalaroop ko jwalamukhi parvat kaha jaataa he
 Volcanoes are related to plate tectonics because it has been found that they are often found on the boundaries of plates because plate boundaries provide weak sites for fractures in the Earth's upper crust
 iske alaava kuch anya sthalon par bhi jwalamukhi paae jate hai jinaki utpatti mantal plum se maani jaati he or aise sthalon ko hotspot kii sangya di jaati he
 In geomorphology, a volcano is seen as an accidental event, and it is classified as a creative force in the forces that bring changes to the surface of the Earth because it creates many landforms
 vahiin, duusari ore paryaavaran bhugol inkaa adhyayan ek prakritik aapadaa ke rup main karata he kyonki isse paaritantr or jaan-maal kaa nuksaan hota he
 Volcano bhu-vaigyanikon main sakriyata ko lekar mataiky nahin he lekin agar koi jwalamukhi vartmaan main fat rahaa ho, yaa uske jald hi fatne kii ashanka ho, yaa phir usamen gas risne, dhuaan yaa lava ugalane, yaa bhucamp aane jaise sakriyata ke chihn hon to use sakriy mana jaataa he
 These are volcanoes that scientists expect will not explode
 inke bare main yah anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki inke andar lava va megma khatm ho chukaa he or ab inamen ugalane kii garmi va saamagree bachi hi nahin he
 If there is no memory of any volcano ever having any event of explosive type of activity, then it is often considered dead
 vaigyanikon main mrit or supt jwalamukhiyon main antar bataa paanaa kathin he, lekin agar maanviya smriti main koi jwalamukhi kabhi bhi itihaas main bahut pehle fata ho to use supt hi mana jaataa he lekin mrit nahin
 There are many volcanoes that, after bursting, go through millions of years to create pressure for another eruption - they are considered dormant during that time

 In this ejaculation, a large amount of gas flows out with the lava, and the lava is cone-like and sometimes in the form of a dome or mound
 arthath ve jwalamukhi jinke vivar yaa mukh kaa vyas kuch 100 feet se adhik nahin hota he or iskaa aakaar gol yaa kareeb-kareeb gol hota he, tathaa jinase gas lava tathaa vikhandit padaarth adhik maatra main visphotak udbhedan ke saath aakaar main kaaphi oonchaai tak prakat hote hai, kendriya udgaar vaale jwalamukhi kehalaate hai
 They are highly destructive
 udgaar se bhayankar bhucamp aate hai
 These are again classified into several types depending on the intensity of the explosion: is prakaar ke udbhedan main lava ke saath gas kii maatra kam hoti he jisase lava daraaron main hokar dhraraatal par jamane lagata he
 Sometimes due to the accumulation of large amounts of lava, a thick layer is formed, which results in the formation of lava plains or lava plateaus
 jaise-1783 main iceland main ek 17 mile lambe daraar se hokar lava kaa udgaar hua he
 Which extended to 218 miles

 Vegetative cover affects the water flowing above the surface of the land while river vessels get their shape from the vegetation within them
 paristhitik jal vaigyanik sthaliy or jaleey pranaaliyon donon kaa adhyayan karte hai
 In terrestrial ecosystems, interaction of vegetation, land surface, vados area and ground water are the main attraction points
 jaleey paaritantron main is baat par bal diya jaataa he kis tarah jal rasayan, bhu-akruti vigyaan or jal vigyaan unki sanrachana or kaary ko prabhavit karte hai
 The principles of ecological hydrology are expressed in three sequential components: paristhitiki tantra sevaaon main vruddhi ho
 His expression can be seen as a testable estimate: paristhitik jal vigyaan main ek moulik sankalpana yah he ki paudhe kaa sharir vigyaan sidhe pani kii uplabdhta se judaa hua he
 Where there is sufficient water such as in the rainforest, plant growth depends more on the availability of nutrients
 haalanki, africa charaagaah jaise arddh-shushk kshetron main vanaspati kaa prakaar or vitaran sidhe hi pani kii us maatra se sambandhit hota he jo paudhe mitti se nikaal sakate hai
 When sufficient soil water is not available, a water-stressed condition occurs

 aam taur par vados kshetra yaa zamin ke neeche mitti ke asantrupt bhaag main maujuud pani kii maatra kaa varnan karne ke liye mitti kii nami shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since plants depend on this water for important biological processes, soil moisture is an integral part of the study of ecological hydrology
 mitti kii nami ko aam taur par jaleey tatv, θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } yaa santrupti, s { \ displaystyle S} ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 These terms are related to the constancy, n { \ displaystyle n} through the equation θ = n s { \ displaystyle \ theta = ns}
 samay ke saath mitti kii nami main aae parivartan ko mitti kii nami kii gatiki ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Ecological hydrological theory also gives importance to topical and spatial relationships
 samyaanusaar paaritantr ke vikaas main vishesh rup se varshan ghatnaon main, jal vigyaan ek mahatvapurn kaarak ho saktaa he
 For example, the Mediterranean landscape has dry summers and rainy winters
 agar vanaspati garmi ke mausam main utpann hoti he to aksar pani ke tanaav kaa anubhav hota he bhale hi saal bhar main kul varsha thik maatra main hui ho
 in kshetron main paaritantr is prakaar viksit hue hai taaki sardiyon main jab jal sulabh hota he tab adhik pani kii maang karne vaale ghaas ko or garmiyon main jab jal kii kami hoti he tab sookhaa-anukulit pedo ko sahaara mili
 Ecological hydrology is also related to aquatic factors behind the spatial distribution of plants
 paudhon main ishtatam antar or sthanik sanghathan kam se kam aanshik rup se jal kii uplabdhta se nirdhaarit hota he
 Trees are located farther in soil-less soil ecosystems than in well-watered areas
 ek paridrishy main ek bindu par jal kaa santulan paristhitik jal vigyaan kaa moulik sameekaran he
 Water balance shows that the amount of water entering the soil should be equal to the change in the amount of water coming out of the soil and stored in the soil
 The main four components of water balance are: precipitation penetration into the soil, evaporation, water leakage into the soil depth beyond the reach of plants and water runoff from the surface of the soil
 This is described by the following equation: n z r d s d t = r − i − q − e − l { \ displaystyle nz_{r}{ \ frac {ds}{dt}}=r-i-q-e-l} The total amount of water contained in the core region is indicated on the left side of the equation
 vanaspati ke liye sulabh is pani kii maatra mitti kii sanradhrata n { \ displaystyle n} isaki santrupti se gunan or paudhe ke mul kii gaharaai ke samaan he
 The differential equation ds / dt { \ displaystyle ds / dt} shows how the saturation of the soil changes as time passes
 daayin ore varsha kii dar, avarodhan, apvaah, vaashpan-utsarjan or risaav die gaye hai
 These are given in millimeters per day
 Runoff, evaporation and leakage all depend heavily on the saturation of the soil at a given time
 sameekaran ko hal karne ke liye, mitti kii nami ke kaary ke rup main vaashpan-utsarjan kii dar gyaat honi chahie
 aam taur par ise varnan karne vaale namoonay ke anusaar ek nishchit santrupti ke baad vashpikaran uplabdh dhoop jaise jalwaayu ke karkon par hi nirbhar hoga
 is bindu ke neeche pahunchane par mitti kii nami vaashpan-utsarjan ko niyantrit karti he or yah kam hone lagati he jab tak ki mitti us bindu tak na pahunch jaae jahaan vanaspati ke liye or pani nikaalnaa sukar na ho
 mitti ke is str ko aam taur par "sthaayee shithilan bindu" kaha jaataa he
 The term is misleading because many plant species are not really "relaxing"

 The Nand Dynasty was the most powerful and great justice or barber dynasty of ancient India
 jisane paanchavin-chauthi shatabdi isa purv uttari bharat ke vishaal bhaag par shashan kiya
 Nandavansha was founded by the first Chakravarti Emperor Mahapadmananda
 bhartiya itihaas main pehali baar ek aise samrajya kii sthapana hui jisaki simaaen ganga ke maidaanon ko long gai
 This empire was not actually a loose union of independent states or feudal lords but rather a powerful king force
 ye ek ekaraat kii chhatrachhaaya main ek akhand rajtantr tha, jiske paas apaar sanybal, dhanabal or janabal tha
 Chakravarti emperor Mahapadmananda conquered all the nearby dynasties and established a vast empire and implemented the system of central governance
 isiilie samraat mahapadam nand kokendriya shashan paddati kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 It is worth remembering what the kings of Nandavans donated to their heirs and future generations
 In Smith's words, "he forced 66 conflicting states not to overthrow each other and entrust themselves to a higher regulatory authority
" " ni:andeh nando ke utthan ko bhartiya raajnneeti ke utkarsh kaa pratik mana ja saktaa he
 This was confirmed in "mahananda" from the early three shlokas of the epic "krishna Charitra" composed by Emperor Samudragupta
 magar ukt mahakavy kaa vivaran maatr hi shesh he
 Samudra Vasana Shebhya: Hai Aas Mudampi Shriya:
 upaay hastera krishya:tat:shodkrut nandsaat
 
 itihaas kii jaankaree ke anek vivaran puraanon, jain or buddha granthon evam unani itihaaskaaron ke varnan main praapt hote hai
 However, it can be said with certainty that Nanda was a Kshatriya dynasty whose most of the nature was of Indian governance tradition
 curtius kahata he ki sikandar ke samay shaashak kaa pita vastav main ek garib nai kaa betaa tha, unani lekhakon ke varnanon se gyaat hota he ki vah "vartmaan raja" agramas athwa jandrama tha, jisaki pahchaan dhananand se kii gai he
 His father was Mahapadmananda, which seems to be the Kshatriya varna from the appropriate statement of Curtius
 kuch puraana granth or jain granth "parishisht parvan main bhi use naapit kaa putr kaha gaya he
 Only one thing is clear from these many references that the king of Nandavans was of the justice justice Kshatriya varna
 nandavansh kaa pratham or sarvaprasiddh raja hua
 The Puranas count it only in the Shaishunag dynasty, but in the Buddhist and Jain Anushrutis it is considered the initiator of a new dynasty, which is correct
 use jain granthon main ugrasen or puraanon main mahapadmapati bhi kaha gaya he
 In the Kaliyugarajavrittantavale portions of the Puranas, it is given the nouns of Atibali, Mahakshatrantaka and and Parasurama
 spasht he, bahut badi senawale us raaj ne apane samakalik anek kshatriya rajwanshon kaa uchchhed kar apane bal kaa pradarshan kiya
 It is not surprising that with that immense wealth and military power, he undertook to conquer all the regions between the Himalayas and the Narmada
 uske jite hue pradeshen main akshvaku, paanchal, kauravy, kaashi, haihay, ashmak, vitihotra, kaling, shurasen, mithila, tathaa anya anek rajya shaamil the
 Nowhere between the Himalayas and Vindhyachal could there be a violation of his rule
 is prakaar usne sari prithvi par "ekarat, hokar rajya kiya
 The authenticity of these Puranic victories of Mahapadmananda is also proved by some scattered references to the Kathasaritsagar, the elephant cave records of Kharavel and some records from Mysore
 jain or buddha granthon se ye praapt hota hai ki mahapadmanand kii do raniyon thi rani avantika or ranimura or donon maharaniyaan hi behad sundar or khubasurat thi mahapadmanand kii raniyon ke bare main adhik jaankaree nahi milti hai The Puranas state the ten sons of Mahapadmananda as the heir
 vahaan unke naam milte hai Ganga Pal, Panduk, Pandugati, Bhootpal, Rashtrapal, Govishanak, Dashasiddhak, Kaivart and Dhananand, Chand Nand chandragupta maury nand vansh ke sasthaashak chakravarti samraat mahapadmanand ke ve putr the jinka vaastavik naam chandranand tha jinaki maa ekbrahraman parivaar se thi mahapadmanand ke baad unke putr dhananand raja hue jinke dar se sikandar bhi bhaag gaya tha
 Dhanananda beat the minister Chanakya and drove him out of the assembly, because Chanakya sat on the throne before Dhananand
 chanakya ne dhananand ke sautele bhai chandranand ko bhadakaakar dhananand ko dhokhe se chandranand se maravakar chandranand kro raja banaaya or chandranand kro chandragupta maury naam diya 
 The Sumalya of the Puranas seems to be difficult to match to any of the eight names other than Mahapadma mentioned in Buddhist texts
 kintu sabhi milakar sankhya kii drushti se navanand kahe jate the
 There is no dispute in this
 puraanon main un sabakaa rajyakaal 100 varshon tak bataaya gaya he - 88 varshon tak mahapadmanand kaa or 12 varshon tak uske putron kaa
 But the same person continued to rule for 88 years and subsequent successive 8 kings should rule only for 12 years, it does not seem wise
 sinhalai anushrutiyon main navanandon kaa rajyakaal 40 varshon kaa bataaya gaya he or use ham sahi maan sakate hai
 Accordingly, the Nawanandas circa 364 BC
 From 324 BC Ruled until
 itnaa nishchit he ki unamem antim raja agramas arthath ugrasen kaa putr) sikandar ke akraman ke samay magadhaa kaa samrat tha, jisaki vishaal or shaktishaalee senaaon ke bhay se unani sipaahiyon ne poras se hue yuddh ke baad aage badhane se inkaar kar diya
 Plutarch says that Chandragupta Maurya met Alexander and spoke of his lowliness and unpleasantness in public
 sambhav he, dhananand ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye chandragupta ne us videshi akramanakari ke upyog kaa bhi praytn kiya ho
 It is known from the "mahavanshatika" that the last Nanda was a tough ruler and a person of greedy and scrupulous nature
 sambhavat: is lobhi prakruti ke kaaran hi use dhananand kaha gaya
 He also insulted Chanakya
 isaki pushti mudrarakshas naatak se hoti he, jisase gyaat hota he ki chanakya apane pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 Humiliated, he took the oath of annihilation of the Nanda Empire and with the support of Prince Chandragupta Maurya, he succeeded in that task
 un donon ne us kaary ke liye punjab ke kshetron se ek vishaal sena taiyaar kii, jisamen sambhavat: kuch videshi tatv or lutere vyakti bhi shaamil the
 It is also known that Chandragupta had made a treaty with Parvatak in the overthrow of Dhanananda
 usne magadh par do akraman kiye, yah sahi prathit hota he, parantu "divyavdaan" kii yah anushruti ki pehle usne sidhe magadh kii rajdhani patliputra par hi dhaava bol diya tathaa asafal hokar use or chanakya ko apane praan bachaane ke liye vesh banaakar bhaagna padaa, sahi nahin prathit hoti
 Probably between them, 324 BC The war took place when Chandragupta started the Mauryan dynasty in Pataliputra, the capital of Magadha
 nando kaa samrajya saamaajik, aarthik, raajnneetik sampannataa evam sainya sanghathan kaa charam bindu tha
 His largest well-organized army had 2 xxrep 5 0 footmen, 8 xxrep 4 0 cavalry, 8000 war chariots, 6000 elephants
 jisaki sahaayta se samraat mahapadmanand ne uttar pashchim, dakshin purv disha main bahut badi sainik vijay praapt kii or us samay ke lagbhag sabhi aas pados ke samrajyo kaa ant kar ke un kaa namonishaan mitaa diya
 For this reason, in the Puranas, he has been called Sarvakshatrantaka or another Parashurama
 vishwa vijeta sikandar ne bharat par akraman ke samay samraat ghanaanand kii vishaltam sena dekh kar ke hausala post ho gaya 
 In front of such a huge power, even a great world conqueror like Alexander, understood his goodness in returning only by bowing down
 samraat mahapadmanand ne tatkaaleen bharat kii vistrut sabhi 16 mahajanapadon kaashi, kaushal, vajji, mall,chedi,vatsa,ank, magadh, avaneet, kuru, paanchal, gandhar kamboj,shurasen ,ashmak, evam kaling ko jitkar evam susangathit kar pratham baar sudrudh kendriya prashasan kii niv daali tathaa aage aane vaali peedi ke shaskaon ko shashan karne kii utkrisht paddati sikhalaai jiskaa prabhaav aadhunik shashan paddati main bhi dikhaai padataa he
 That is why Chakravarti emperor Mahapadmananda is called the father of central governance
 nando kaa rajkosh dhan se bharaa rahata tha, jisamen 99 karod kii apaar swarna mudraaen thi 
 The main reason for their economic prosperity was systematic profit oriented foreign and internal trade

 When he is not a helpless creature who is only hoping to get something from life, he will be able to give something to life, then his worry will suddenly be wasted about how life is so destructive - his main concern will be that Can make it so abstract

 How many such people were born in India and went away

 "hindu society used to say that" humans are for religion "while Ambedkar believed that" religions are for humans
 " " ambedkar ne kaha ki aise dharm kaa koi matlab nahin jisamen manushyata kaa kuch bhi mulya nahin
 There is no point in living in such a religion which does not allow the followers of their own religion to get religious education, interrupts their jobs, insults them and even gives them water
