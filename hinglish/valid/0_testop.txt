 Ardhangini of Prithviraj was formed by doing Gandharva with Prithviraj
 bharat ke itihaas kii mahatvapurn ghatnaon main sanyogitaaharan gina jaataa he
 The coincidence was the most beautiful of Prithviraj's thirteen rajnis
 sanyogita ko tilottama, kantimati, sanjukta ityadi naamon se bhi janaa jate the
 His father was King Jayachand of Kannauj
 jinhone prithviraj ke viraddh ghori ko yuddh main sahaayta kii thi
 Sanyogita was born in Kannauj region
 uske pita kaa naam jayachand tha
 Prithvirajaraso mentions in the poetry of Samyukritasvayamvara, that Samyukrita was an apsara named Rambha in his previous birth
 kasi rishi ke shaap ke kaaran vah sanyogita ke naam se prithvi par avatarit hui
 Sanyogita is available in a different form in the Vividha poems
 yatha prithvirajraso kavy main sanyogita, prithvirajvijay mahakavy main tilottama or surajncharitamahakavy main kantimati
 In Prithvirajasso's poetry and in the famous epic, it is clearly stated that Sanyogita was the daughter of Jayachand
 prithvirajvijay mahakavy kaa mahan bhaag kshatiyukt he
 But there too, coincidence was born in a village developed on the banks of river Ganges, this mention is attainable
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, wo nagar nishchay hi kannauj tha 
 When Sankatita attained youth, Prithviraj's valor was being discussed all over India
 sanyogita ne jab prithviraj kii veerta kii katha suni, tab vah prithviraj ke prem pash main bandha gai
 In courtship, AC girls have been called Mugdha
 mugdh sanyogita ke hridayastha prem ke vishay main jab jayachand ko sangyaan hua, to usne anya raja ke saath apni putree kaa vivaah karne ke liye udyat hua
 Because the relationship between Jayachand and Prithviraj was illogical
 uske baad jayachand ne ashwamedhyagy kaa aayojan kiya
 At the end of that sacrificial fire, he announced the Swayamvara of Sanyogita
 swayamvar ke avasar par usne sampoorn bharat ke sabhi raajaaon ko nimantran diya parantu prithviraj ko nimantran nahin diya
 Jayachand was not satisfied even after insulting Prithviraj in this way
 atah usne lohe se prithviraj kii murti banavaa kar dwarpal ke sthaan par prasthaapit kar di
 But at the time of swayamvar, Sanketita put the statue of Prithviraj to the garland
 dwaar par sthit sanyogita jab prithviraj kii murti ko varmala pahana rahi thi, usee samay prithviraj ne prasaad main pravesh kiya
 Prithviraj placed Sanyogita on the horse and went to Dehli
 ek baar ajmeru ke mahal ke udyaan main raja prithviraj vihaar kar rahe the, usee samay vahaan pratihaari upasthit hua
 Pratihari said to the king, "O Rajan! a woman from Kanyakubj wants to meet you"
 uske baad raja kaa sanket paa kar pratihaari ne us mahila ko raja ke sammukh prastut kiya
 Greeting the king, the woman said, "O Rajan! The name of the coincidental lady of Jayachand, the lord of Kanyakubja is a girl
 main uske soundarya kaa kya varnan karun ? kaamdev kaa siddhi ke rup main samast padaartha ke saar se brahma ne uski rachana kii he
 The things which were collected by Brahma at the time of creation of Sanyogita, only those things produced amrit, moon, kumud and lotus "
 kinchat ruk kar vah mahila aage boli, "he hindushreshth ! yadi kisi amritsamudr main kaamdev manthan karte, to jo lakshmih hui, un soundaryavati lakshmi se hi kadachit sanyogita ke soundarya kii tulana kar sakate hai"
 Once in the palace with his father, Sanyogita accidentally heard your virtuous song sung by the bards
 jab aap ne mlechhraj ko yuddh main parajeet kiya, tab hi uske hriday main aapke prati anuraag samudbhoot hua
 The golden face like the golden flower of Sanyogita has become the desired lotus flower from your face
 janau kaphoni, karkamal main kapolan, nasika kii ore drushti or aapako man main sthapit kar vah din bitaa rahi hai
 One day, in the third stroke of the night, in a dream, Sanyogita appeared to you as Kamdevarupi
 uskaa virah charamasima ko laangh gaya he
 Hey Rajan! Today the Creator is also raining on him
 sanyogita ke pita uske shatru ban kar sanyogita kaa vivaah anyaraaja ke saath karwaane ke liye udyukt hai
 Hearing the father's wish, weeping princess sadly said to her friend, "ah! Ipsa is foolish to get to the moon by being on the earth
" jis purush ko main nahin jaanati hoon, us purush ke krute pranay ev haasyaaspad he
 It is special that the man is a great emperor
 kanya dwaara kiya gaya vivaah prastaav api vidmbana utpann karata he
 So hey sister! i do not even have the imagination of the seed of hope on my mischievous desire
 ”by saying this, the coincidence fainted
 uske baad prayatnon se jaagarit sanyogita boleen, "tum shakambhari jaao
 Set my heart in front of the emperor
 yadi vah mere uddhaaran ke liye nahin aayenge, tarhi main ganga main dub jaaongi"
 Hearing the request of the hostess, the emperor replied that, "let the wish of that mriganayani be fulfilled
 use kaho ki, main sheeghra hi uski raksha ke liye kanyakubj aauunga"
 After that the hostess deserved hospitality and sent her back
 turant vah swayan bhi apane samanton ke saath kanyakubj kii ore chal padey
 When Prithviraj entered Kanyakubja, he was a pseudo-magician
 kyonki vah kanyakubj kii prayek vithi dekhnaa chaahate the
 Therefore, Prithviraj started touring here and there in the city disguised as Charan
 prithviraj ne kanyakubj nagar ke dwaar, prasaad, vishaal bhawan, chatushpadi or udyaan dekhen
 And while traveling in Kanyakubj city, he gathered information about the city
 surjancharit mahakavy ke anusaar prithviraj ratri main hi sanyogita ko le kar indrapastha chale gayi
 From the mention of coincidence in other texts, a few different references are found in the epics
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki, "jayachand ke shilalekhon main kahin bhi sanyogita kaa ullekh nahin praapt hota he
 And with no evidence of her existence, she is considered a fictional character "
 jo vidvan sanyogita ke aitihaasik paatr hone ke vishay par prashnarthchihn karte hai, unamem dow
 gaurishankar hirachand ojha kii gananaa hoti he
 Dr
 Ojha is of the opinion that nowhere in Jayachand's inscriptions or in the Tamrapatras is there a description of coincidence and no mention of coincidence is found in Rambhamanjarimahakaavya and in Hammirmahakaavya
 atah solahavin shatbdi ke kisi bhaat kii kalpana thi sanyogita kaa paatr he 
 Other historians say that, in Rambhamanjarimahakaavya and in Hammirmahakaavya, there is no description of coincidence Oza-sir said
 parantu un granthon main prithviraj ke vivaahon kaa ullekh hi nahin he
 Can not say that Prithviraj was not married

 The Sami people are the name of a tribal community settling in the Kola Peninsula of northern Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia
 yah jis arctic kshetra main rahete hai use sapami bhi bulaayaa jaataa he or iskaa kshetrafal lagbhag 3,88,350 kimi2 he
 Originally these people speak Sami languages, which is a branch of the Yurali family
 parmparik rup se inkaa vyavsaay rangifer-paalan, machhlee pakadana, bhed charaana or junglee jaanwaron kaa shikaar karnaa hua karata tha
 The total population of Samians has been estimated between 1
5 to 2 lakhs
 samiyon ko europe main pehle 'lap' yaa 'laplander' bulaayaa jaataa tha, lekin sami ab ise ek apshabd samajhate hai kyonki iskaa matlab ' kapade kaa chithda' he
 This word meant that the Sami are poor and fathala
 sami log apni mathrubhumi main pichley 5,000 saalon se bas rahe hai, haalaanki inke ilaaken main 10,000 varsh puraane avshesh mili hai jinamein se kuch par usee prakaar ke chithran hai jo sami aaj bhi paramparaagat rup se prayog karte hai
 
 yah europe ke sabase uttartam mul nivasee samajhe jate hai
 He was named by his ancient Roman historian Tacitus in his writings as 'fan'
 mana jaataa he ki pichley himyug ke dauraan samiyon ke purvaj norge ke pashchimi tat par based hue the or jaise-jaise badhati garmi se himaniyaan hatate gaye vaise yah purv kii ore baaqi uttari scandinavia main fail gaye
 In Europe, it has been a matter of controversy how far the Sami formerly extended from their modern region to the south
 is prashan ke uttar par samiyon kaa apni zameenon par adhikaar hone kaa nirnay bhi tikaa hua tha
 At first it was believed that they lived north of central Scandinavia, but modern discovery has also found medieval Semitic remains in some parts of southern Norway
 18veen sadi tak sami log bahut had tak norge se swatantra jivan vyateet karte the, lekin 19veen sadi main apane raashtra ko sangathit karne ke prayaas main norge ne samiyon par apni samskruti chhodkar norgeian samskruti or bhashaa apnaane ke liye dabaav daalaa
 Northern Norway was developed, and it also created an inferiority complex among the Samians for their culture
 sweden or finland main itnaa dabaav nahin tha lekin vahaan bhi paathshaalaon main sami bhashaaon par pabandi laga di gai
 In Sweden, under the racist policies of 1913–1920, the Samians were described as an inferior caste
 jivit logon or qabron main dafan shariron se adhyayan ke liye sample liye gaye
 Some Sami women were forcefully sterilized so that they could not produce children
 norgeian logon ko sami kshetron main ghuskar basane ke liye riyaayaten di gai
 When Nazi Germany annexed Scandinavia, they also tried to eradicate the symbols of Semitic culture
 1979 main norge ke sami kshetra ke finmark zile ke aalata shahar main ek band banane kii yojana bani
 The Samians strongly opposed this
 band phir bhi bana lekin is ghatana se samiyon main apane adhikaron or apni pahchaan le liye ladane kii ek nai chetana janmi
 In 1986 the Samians created their own national anthem and flag
 2005 main norge kii sansad ne 'finmark vidheyak' paarit kiya jiske antargat sami sansad or finmark prantiy parishad ko finmark zile ke un ilaaqon kaa prashasan saunpa gaya jinpar pehle norge kii sarkaar kaa niyantran tha
 Now the Sami are trying to rekindle their language and culture

 His most famous song is Damadam Mast Qalandar
 runa laila kaa janm purvi bengal ke silahat shahar main 17 navambar 1952 ko hua jab us kshetra kaa naam purvi pakistan tha 
 His middle-class father was from the city of Rajshahi
 jab ve choti bacchee thim, ek sangeet ke ustad ghar aakar unki badi bahan dina laila ko sangeet sikhaaya karte the
 Runa was small but she learned music easily
 runa laila kii asli ruchi nrity ke saath thi or unhone katthak, bharatnatyam or kathakali main talim hasil kii
 In 1960, he got his early music education in Karachi where his family was settled
 unke guru ustad kasim the, jo baad main 'piya rang' ke naam se jane jate the
 Like other Bengali families, Runa Laila's family also emphasized art

 Runa Laila's singing was first performed by coincidence when her elder sister, Dina, was invited to sing on stage, but her throat suddenly worsened
 runa tab itani choti thim ke unase tanpura bhi khadaa karke pakadaa na gaaya or use apane god main lita kar unhone ek khyaal gaya

 He drew a lot of inspiration from the famous Pakistani playback singer Ahmed Rushdie and later Runa's jugalbandi in many songs
 1970-80 ke dashak main unhone kain pakistani filmi nagmein gaaye
 'umrao Jaan Adaa', made in 1972, was a film that ran a lot and was sung by Runa Laila for the rest of the song
 unki bahan dina bhi, jo kabhi pakistani netaa makhdoom amin fahim se vivaahit thim, gayikee main pravesh karnaa chaahati thim lekin unhone shaadi hone par yah sapana tyaag diya
 He later died of cancer
 runa laila nen unki smriti main bangladesh main chheh sangeet kaarykram yojit kiye jinase mili hui raashi se unhone bangladesh kii rajdhani dhaka main ek bacchon ke aspataal main ek cancer ward banwaaya
 Bangladesh became independent in 1971 and in 1974 she sang in the Hindustani film 'ek Se Ek Se Ek Ek', whose song 'damadam Mast Qalandar' became a superhit in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh
 1977 main bani film 'gharonda' ke bhi kain gane unhone gaaye jo bahut pasand kiye gaye
 After that he stopped singing in Hindi films but he is still liked in India

 iske vipareet kumargupta pratham kii pratham gyaat tithi guptasanwat 96= 415 i
, unke bilsand abhilekh se praapt hoti he
 On this basis, it is estimated that the reign of Chandragupta II may have ended in 413–14 AD

 chandragupta ke sandhivigrahik virasen shaab ke udaygiri guhaalekh se, unka samast prithvi jatine ke uddeshy se vahaan tak aana spasht he
 His long-standing presence in the Malava region is evident from the writings of the Gupta Samvat 82 of the feudatory ruler of Chandragupta, Sanakaniq Maharaj, and the Sanchi Gupta Samvat 93 of a magistrate named Amarkardava, obtained from this place
 sambhavat: chandragupta dwitiya ne shaq rudrasingh tritiy ke viruddh yusanchalan tathaa vijayoparant saurashtra ke shashan ko yaheen se vyavasthit kiya ho
 Chandragupta's Shakavijaya is also estimated from his Rajatamudras

 Chandragupta ii's picture, name, Virud and date of Mudrachalana are written on these postures prevalent in imitation of Saukamudra tradition of Saurashtra

 Chandragupta's army chief Amarkardava, in his Sanchi inscription, calls himself, many Samaravaptavijayyasupatakas
 in anek samaron ke ullekh se yah bhi anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki chandragupta ne shakayuddh ke atirikt anya yuddh bhi kiye honge
 But in the present situation his discussion is unproven

 Chandra has been identified with various emperors of ancient India 
 kintu praaia: vidvan unki pahchaan chandragupta dwitiya se karte hai
 If this theory is believed to be correct, then it will not be said that the second Chandragupta defeated the enemies who came in the organization of Vanga region and crossed the seven faces of the Indus and won the Vahlikas
 vang ko pahchaan saadharantaya purvi bengal tathaa bahli kii balkh se kii jaati hai, yadhyapi kuch aashcharya nahin jo vahlikon kii nivas pashchimi pakistan main hi kahin rahaa ho

 Some people add them and make fun of history

 In this connection, it is known that during the Gupta period there used to be an independent council for the support of the Crown

 The capital of Chandragupta was Pataliputra

 It is quite possible that after the defeat of Shaka Rudrasinh, Chandragupta made Ujjayini the second capital of the kingdom of Hapna
 sahityagranthon main vikramaditya ko bhi in donon hi nagaron se sambhddha kiya gaya he
 Only after the victory of Ujjayini would Malav Samvat be associated with the name of Vikramaditya and started being named as vikram-samvat
