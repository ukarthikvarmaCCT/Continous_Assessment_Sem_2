 This revolution changed the direction of modern history

 In the modern era, the state revolution of France proved to be the most dramatic and complex in which the Western civilization shook Western civilization

 The French Revolution has been called a milestone in the history of the entire world

 This created an atmosphere against monarchy and autocracy in Asian countries, including European nations

 In this the king had unlimited rights and the king was arbitrary

 Louis was the ruler of the 16th on the eve of the revolution
 vah ek akarmanya or ayogy shaasha tha
 He too exhibited demeanor and autocracy

 Which was hereditary

 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people
 in utpeedak raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne kranti kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi
 The peasants had to pay many taxes to the state, the church and other zamindars and the feudal tyrants had to bear
 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable
 is tarah 1789 kii francisi kranti, francisi samaaj main asamanta ke viruddh sangharsh thi
 The economic condition of France was in trouble

 In fact the royal treasury was emptied due to the extravagance of the kings of France and the frequent wars of Louis the 14th

 An excessive amount of the state was spent on the emperor, empress and his family

 On the other hand the tax system was unsatisfactory

 In this way the state of the treasury had become extremely thoughtful

 The state was burdened with debt
 mul dhan kii to baat hi kya france byaaj chukaane main asamarth tha arthath rajya divaaliepan kii sthiti main pahunch gaya tha
 The country's economic malpractices could be improved by encouraging trade commerce, but the government's commercial policy was so uncontrolled and flawed that it did not make possible the development of production and trade in the state
 lui 16wein ne turgon, nekar jaise vitt salaahkaaron ke madhyam se aarthik sankat ko dur kanane kaa prayaas kiya lekin ye sudhaar prayaas lagu nahin ho sake kyonki visheshadhikaar praapt varg ne apane upar kar lagane kii baat sweekaar nahin kii
 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is
 francisi kranti main darshanikon kii bhoomika ke sandarbh main do mat saamne aate hai-ek, darshanikon ne kranti kii paristhitiyon ko janm dekar kranti ko utpann kiya or doosraa kranti kaa strot to us samay ke rashtriya jivan ke dosha main tathaa sarkaar kii bhuulon main tha or darshanikon ne kranti utpann nahin kii
 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii
 Voltaire illustrated the liberal politics, religion and freedom of thought of Britain through his book Letters on English and compared it to the ancient French system and noted the evils and shortcomings prevalent in France
 pratibandhit hone se purv ye pustaken bahut lokapriy hui thi
 "voltaire" wrote against the Church's corrupt pickles, intolerance, injustice, oppression and tyranny

 He wrote that crush the notorious and infamous thing
 yah spasht rup se france ke nirankush rajtantr evam carch ke atyaachaar par prahaar tha
 Waltair wanted to establish a similar rule in France, in line with the constitutional monarchy of England
 usne kaha ki main sau chuhon ke sthaan par ek singh kaa shashan pasand karata hoon
 Voltaire did not speak of revolution but laid the background for freedom of thought
 usne puraatan francisi vyavastha kii buraaiyon ko ujagar kiya
 He presented to the people the mirror of the erstwhile French society and said that the mirror is called a stain
 ruso ne apni pustak “emily”, “soshal contract”, “rusoni” ke madhyam se manushya kii swatantraaa kii baat kii
 It said that despite being born free of human beings, everyone is chained with chains
 in zanjeeron se mukti paane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham prakritik aadim avasthaa kii ore laute
 The Russians said that it is the compulsory and universal duty of a state made by collective will to conduct the work considering the whole society as paramount
 jin logon ko karypalika shakti saupin gai he ve janata ke swami nahin uske kaaryakari he, or unka kartavya janata kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa he
 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya
 The law of the state should be an expression of this common desire, but the nature of the law is no longer such, but it is dependent on the will of the ruler
 ruson ne bhi kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin sabhi vyakti ko swatantra evam samaan mana or francisi kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav usee ke vichaaron se prabhavit the
 Napoleon acknowledged his importance and said that if there had not been the Russians, there would not have been a revolution in France

 The French scholar Didro is credited with compiling the works of the best thinkers of the 18th century and bringing them to the general public

 The French government considered the Daiders to be its greatest enemy and imposed several restrictions on his book

 He argued that only land is the primary source of all wealth

 By the time of the 16th, the French financial system had sunk into debt
 america swatantraaa sangram ne france ke divaaliepan par muhar laga di
 Therefore, in order to overcome the economic distress, the help of economists like Turks, Necker, Cologne took
 colon ne visheshadhikaar praapt kuleen varg par kar lagane kaa suzav diya jise kulinon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The meeting of the States General was finally called

 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy
 estats general ke adhiveshan main matadhikaar paddati ke mudde par tritiy state evam anya state ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote
 is prakaar visheshadhikaar praapt varg kaa do tathaa jansadharan kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court
 francisi kranti vibhinn charnon se hote hue apane mukaam tak pahunchi
 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes
 janata kii in kaarywahiyon kaa rashtriya sabha par bhi gaharaa asar padaa
 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791
 samvidhan main do baton par bal diya gaya-ek, rajya kii saarvbhaum shakti janata main nihit he or doosraa, shakti kaa pruthakkaran rajya evam janata ke hit main he
 Although the system of governance remained monarchical, the king's powers were limited
 ab vah kanoon nirmaataa nahin rahaa
 The king did not have the right to make war or treaty with any country
 kanoon banane kaa adhikaar ek vyavasthapika sabha ko diya gaya or uske sadasyon kii sankhya 745 thi
 The citizens were divided into two parts, active and inactive, for the election of members of the administration and the franchise was given only to the active citizens
 sakriy naagarik 25 varsh se adhik aayu ke ve log the jo rajya ko teen din kii aay ke baraabar pratyaksh kar dete the jabaki niskriy naagarik ve the jo garib the
 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune
 prayek ikaiyon kaa shashan chalaane ke liye nirvachan parishad hoti thi jiskaa chunaav sakriy naagarik karte the
 In this way, the entire state system from the local level to the central level came to the Barja class

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge
 faltah ye vyaavhaarik raajnneetijna nahin the
 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
 The ability of property to be representative was also made a basis and it was only the rich who could participate in political activities and this meant that the rich people belonged to the middle class
 is tarah francisi kranti ne janm par aadhaarit bhedbhaav ko nasht kiya parantu uske jagah pracheen samantvaad ke badale dhan par aadhaarit nae samantvaad kaa prabhutv hua
 During the revolution, the revolutionaries talked about the loans taken by the autocratic government, but no one talked about forgiving those loans
 iskaa kaaran tha yah rin sarkaar ko burjua varg ne diya tha
 Similarly, the government seized the property of the church but it was not distributed to the landless
 jameenon ko sarvaadhik oonchi keemton par bechaa gaya or is jameen ko kharidne kii kshamta madhyavarg ke paas thi
 The French Revolution ignored the interests of the workers and discouraged the labor movement
 kranti ke dauraan shramik varg ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi kintu burjua netritv ko uski badhati sthiti manjuur nahin thi
 Therefore, the National Assembly re-enacted the laws made in the autocratic monarchy era
 jiske tahat sabhi shramik sangh sambandhi kaaryon par pratibandh laga diya gaye or gildon ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the National Assembly, the bourgeoisie dominated and the Jirondist and Jacobians also belonged to the bourgeoisie
 yadhyapi jacobiyan sarvhaara varg ke hit kii baat karte the parantu aatank ke rajya kii sthapana main burjua hiton ko hi upar rakhaa gaya or shramikon pratikriyaaon ko dabaane hetu sena kii sahaayta lee gai
 Middle-class interests were also given prominence in directory governance
 sanchaalak mandal ne jis dwisadani vidhayika kaa nirmaan kiya uske sabhi sadsy madhyavargeey buddhijivi the
 The bourgeoisie effect can also be seen on Napoleon's reforms
 usne burjua hiton ko sangrakshit rakhte hue apni vidhi samhita main sampatti ke adhikaar ko surakshit rakhaa, kulinon ko apekshaakrit vyapak adhikaar die tathaa uske vyapaarik or vanijyik sudhaaron kaa phayda madhyavarg ko hi mila
 In this way, middle class elements are seen in the form of revolution
 kintu puure kranti or uske prabhaav ke vishleshan se yah spasht hota he ki kranti main madhyavargeey tatwon ke saath krishak, majdoor, mahilaon kii sahamaagita thi
 In this way, it was not just a middle class revolution, but it can be seen as a popular revolution
 francisi kranti ek vishwavyaapee charitra ko liye hue thi
 The revolutionaries declared human and civil rights in 1789, under which it was said that being born equal from birth, all human beings should get equal rights and this is for all nations, for all human beings, for all time and for example
 Are for the world
 yah ghoshnaa sirp france ke liye nahin varan har jagah ke un sabhi logon kii bhalaai ke liye hai jo swatantra hona chaahate the tathaa nirankush rajtantr evam saamanti visheshadhikaron ke boj se mukti paanaa chaahate the, banaaya gaya tha
 In 1792 AD, the English hero named Kompene was awarded the title of French citizen by the National Assembly and was also elected a delegate to the National Convention
 isi prakaar kranti ke dauraan yah vichaar aayaa ki kranti ko sthaayee or sudrudh rakhane ke liye ise europe ke anya deshon main bhi vistaarit kiya jaaen
 It envisages a war in which French forces enter neighboring countries and meet local revolutionaries and overthrow the monarchy and establish republics
 france kii kranti maatr ek rashtriya ghatana nahin thi apitu siddhanton- swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav ke naaron se sampurna europe gunj uthaa
 The effects of the revolution were so far-reaching that all of Europe was covered by it
 isi sandarbh main kaha gaya “yadi france ko zukam hota he to samast europe cheenkta he
 " france kii kranti roosi kranti ke samaan suniyojit nahin thi
 In fact, the Russian Revolution was planned by the Bolsheviks and its aim was to establish the rule of the proletariat by gaining power, but the French Revolution was a victim of events and circumstances from the beginning to the end and the events did not happen in the way that the revolutionaries wished but rather the events gave the revolutionaries Forced to change his path
 stats general kii baithak main yadi tritiy state kii baat anya stats ne maan lee hoti to kranti kaa ruukh doosraa hota
 Similarly, the state of terror and the rule of the directory also did not run in a planned manner
 is drushti se yah kranti avyavasthit thi
 The degeneration of erstwhile French society was also an important factor in the origins of the French Revolution
 puraa samaaj visheshadhikaar praapt or adhikaar viheen virgon main vibhakt tha
 The condition of the peasants was bad due to the burden of taxes, on the other hand they had to suffer exploitation by the tyranny of the feudal and the intervention of the church
 in sthitiyon ne kranti ko raah dikhaai or krantikariyon ne isi asamanta ke viruddh aawaaj buland kii or swatantraaa, samanta tathaa bandhutav kaa naaraa diya
 It was only during the revolution that the end of feudalism was announced, the privileges were abolished
 francisi kranti main sarsaadhaaran kii bhaagedari raheen thi kintu unke hiton ko najrandaaj karke kranti ne adhinayakawad kaa rup dhaaran kar liya jisamen kisi ek vyakti ke siddhanton or ichchhaaon kii pradhanta thi
 In fact, during the revolution, a dictatorial government or dictatorship was established under the leadership of Robspier and later the Nepalese also established the dictatorship
 france kii kranti vahaan kii puraatan vyavastha main vyaapt tamaam vikrutiyon, visangatiyon evam buniyadi dosha ke viruddh ek shashakt pratikriya thi
 The revolution paved the way for democratic governance in France by ending French society based on autocratic monarchy inequality, luxury clergy and the crisis facing economic insolvency
 is drushti se ise drushti se ise pragatisheel kranti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he Not only this, the declaration of human rights, the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity and the ideology of nationalism made the whole world aware of the slogan of nationalism and the ideology of nationalism
 italy evam germany ke ekikaran kii bhaavana ko protsaahan mila
 The issue of segregation of religion and politics first arose during this revolution
 rajya or raajnneeti dharm se alag kiye gaye
 France's state revolution enjoys special importance in world history, it is considered an important event in human history
 isamen na keval france balki europe ke jan jivan main amulya parivartan laa diya isamen shadiyon se chali aa rahi saamanti vyavastha ko nasht kar aadhunik loktantric vyavastha kaa maarg praast kiy
 The autocracy of the monarchy came to an end and people breathed peace in the democratic atmosphere
 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries
 kuch rajyon kii sthiti to france se bhi adhik vikrut thi prasha, austria or rus aadi france se bhi adhik vikrut the
 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation
 samrudh or unnat desh main bhi kranti ho sakati he
 Provided that its residents feel that injustice is being done to them
 france kii janata is anyaay ko mahasus kar rahi thi
 Wanted to get away from it
 vahaan aise anek darshanik or lekhak paidaa hue jinhone apni lekhnee ke dwaara in kashton kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrishti karaayaa anya europee deshon kii badtar sthiti ke baavjud france main sarvapratham lui solvaan ke khilaaf kranti hui
 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom
 parantu france ke kisaan swatantra ho chuke the
 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees
 falat: kulinon kii upyogita samaapt ho gai
 Yet there was no cut in its prerogative
 isliye kisaan or madhyam varg ke log kulinvarg se ghrinaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries
 vahaan abhi bhi kulinon ki payogita bani hui thi
 The influence of philosophers 18 veen shatabdi main sampoorn europe main boudik halchal machi hui thi
 Philosophers, thinkers, scientists were present in all countries
 parantu unamem mukhya france ke vichaarak the
 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha
 Due to this, there was a revolution in France for the first time
 america swatantraaa sangram kaa prabhaav- The American War of Independence started in 1766 AD
 gimen america ke logon ne england ke khilaaf vidroh kar kar diya
 The soldiers of France also got an opportunity to participate in this freedom struggle, so they felt that freedom can be achieved through war
 unhone yah bhi anubhav kiya ki swatantraaa so hi sukh kii prapti sambhav he
 On returning to France, he saw that the freedom he fought for in America is the complete lack of freedom in France
 at: ve yahan kii kranti ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe or yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa praapt karne kii cheshtaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries of Europe
 francisi sabhyataa kii shreshthata- a specific reason for the revolution in France itself was that the civilization and culture of other Europe was more prosperous and rich than other European nations
 shashan vyavastha kii drushti se bhi france kaa shashan atyadhik suvyavasthit tha
 France is considered a symbol of civilization and culture throughout Europe
 sampoorn europe main paris sahitya or chintan kaa sabase bada kendra mana jaataa he
 The France public opinion was more aroused and critical than other European states
 in sabhi kaarnon ke falswarup 1789 i
 main anya europe rajyon main kranti na hokar sarvapratham france main hi krati hui

 After completion of the addition, the mixture was heated for a while
 Formation of the Grignard reagent had completed
 a small amount of magnesium still remained in the flask
 The Grignard reagent thus prepared was cooled to 0°C before the addition of carbonyl compound
 The solution became cloudy since the Grignard reagent precipitated out
 a solution of carbonyl compound was added to the Grignard reagent
 The solution was warmed to room temperature
 The reaction was complete

 The force acting towards the center of the path in the perpendicular direction of the instantaneous velocity of a body is called the centripetal force
 abhikendra bal ke kaaran pind vakr-path par gati karti he 
 For example, concentric force is the cause of circular motion
 a = − v 2 r = − v 2 r u ^ r = − ω 2 r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {a} =-{ \ frac {v^{2}}{r}} \ left=-{ \ frac {v^{2}}{r}}{ \ hat { \ mathbf {u} }}_{r}=- \ omega ^{2} \ mathbf {r} } Where: newton ke gati ke dwitiya niyam ke anusaar yadi kahin koi twaran he to twaran kii disha main bal avashya lag rahaa hoga
 Therefore, if the particle of mass m is moving in a uniform circular motion, the value of the centripetal force acting on it will be given by the following formula: f = − m v 2 r u ^ r = − m ω 2 r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {F} =-{ \ frac {mv^{2}}{r}}{ \ hat { \ mathbf {u} }}_{r}=-m \ omega ^{2} \ mathbf {r} } Auto gain control) is a circuit or control system that maintains the output at a fixed value even if the input signal does not increase

 apekshaakrit baad ke lekhan main unhone kahani-samiksha se dur hatakar kuch vivaadit aalochanatmak lekhan bhi kiya he
 Apart from original writing, there is also a long series of books edited by him
 hindi katha-samiksha main lagbhag paanch dashakon se sakriy hissedari nibhaanevaale madhuresh kaa mul naam ramprakash shankhadhaar he
 He was born in Bareilly on January 10, 1939 in a low-middle-income family
 unki sari padhai vahiin hui
 Apart from pursuing MA in English and Hindi from Bareilly College, Bareilly, he also received phd degree
 aajeevika ke liye unhone praadhyaapan kaa kshetra chunaa
 After teaching English for a few years, he taught for nearly thirty years in the Hindi department of Shivnarayan Das Post Graduate College, Badaun
 vahiin se 30 june, 1999 ko sevanivrutt hokar puri tarah sahitya main sakriy hai
 Initially some of his articles were also published in English
 unki anek rachanaaon kaa vibhinn bhartiya bhashaaon main anuwaad bhi hua he
 Madhuresh's critical writing began in 1962
 pehali aalochanatmak tippanee 'yashpal : santulanheen samiksha kaa ek pratik' san 62 kii 'lahar' main chhapi thi
 In the words of Madhureshji himself, that comment made me the greatest thing for me, that quite a lot made me a potential authentic and reliable commentator of Yashpal
 yadhyapi madhuresh ne kahani evam upanyaas donon kii aalochana main paryaapt shram tathaa prabhoot kaary kiye hai, phir bhi kahani-sameekshak ke rup main unki pahchaan adhik rahi he
 Nearly two dozen original and more than a dozen edited - rich in both quantitative and quantitative terms - in the works of author-editor of books Maduresh, his two books Hindi story: Seeking Asmita, and New Story: Status of Reconsideration 'spine' And both these books are also the basis of their fame - for both strength and range
 vivaadon se praayah dur rahete hue unhone lagbhag ek sadhak kii tarah kahaniyon-upanyaason kii nisthapurna vivechna tathaa kathakaron-aalochakon par vichaar ke dwaara vaiyaktik purvagrahon tathaa aapasi uthaa-patake se sahitya kii lokapekshikta kii kshati ke viruddh sahitya kii sahaj janchetana ke paksh main apane dhang se ek lambaa sangharsh kiya he
 However, the issue of ideological disagreement towards Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma in this sequence and Dr
 Sharma's focus on the neglected litterateurs to some extent also reinforced his own insistence that despite his being considered a 'holtheimer story-critic', his original critical work Away from story-criticism, and despite activism, he did not write anything specific on contemporary stories after 1996 Yes
 yadi ve vastav main kahani-aalochana par hi kendrit rahete to nissandeh hindi kii kahani-aalochana kaaphi samrudh ho chuki hoti
 Ravibhushan ji's comprehensive article compiled in 'criticism is always a possibility' is a well-informed and balanced analysis of both the strength and extent of Madhuresh's writing
 ukt aalekh ke ant main ravibhushan ji kaa nishkarsh drashtavy he- kisi bhi kathalochak kii tulana main unhone kahaniyon kaa vyapak adhyayan kiya he
 His writings peep his labor
 unamem dagamagaahat kam he
 His storytelling has been influenced by book reviews
 ve nirantar sakriy hai
 They cannot be ignored
 jahaan tak unki aalochana-drushti kaa sawaal he, vah khuli, udaar or santulit he

 Lyricist: Sameeras Lyricist: anand-milind chhatrapati shivaji maharaj yaa shivaji raaje bhosle bharat ke raja evam ranneetikaar the jinhone 1674 main pashchim bharat main maratha samrajya kii neenv rakhi
 He fought the Mughal Empire of Aurangzeb for many years
 san 1674 main raigarh main unka rajbhishek hua or chhatrapati bane
 Shivaji provided a qualified and progressive administration with the help of his disciplined army and well organized administrative units
 unhone samar-vidya main anek navachaar kiye tathaa chhapamar yuddh kii nayi style viksit kii
 He revived ancient Hindu political practices and courtesy etiquette and replaced Marathi and Sanskrit with the language of royalty
 bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut se logon ne shivaji ke jeevancharit se prerana lekar bharat kii swatantrata ke liye apana tan, man dhan nyochhavar kar diya
 Today, on the lines of his politics, there is a political aspect called Shiv Sena in Nepal and India
 shivaji maharaj kaa janm 19 farvari 1630 main shivneri durg main hua tha
 Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630 in Shivneri fort with the womb of Jijabai, wife of Shahji Bhonsle
 shivneri kaa durg puna se uttar kii taraf junnar nagar ke paas tha
 His childhood was spent under the guidance of his mother Jijau Maa Saheb
 vah sabhi kalaon main maahir the, unhone bachapan main raajnneeti evam yuddh kii shiksha lee thi
 These belonged to the Bhonsle sub-caste who were originally from the Kshatriya Maratha caste
 gagabhatta ke anusaar shivaji kaa vansh mewar ke prasiddh guhil sisodiya vansh se miltaa he
 It is due to Shivaji that the entire Maratha community has got the status of being a Kshatriya
 unke pita apratim shoorveer the or unki duusari patni tukabai mohite thim
 His mother Jijabai Jadhav was an extraordinary genius born in the clan and his father was a powerful feudal
 shivaji maharaj ke charitra par mata-pita kaa bahut prabhaav padaa
 Right from childhood, he began to understand the atmosphere and events of that era
 shaasha varg kii karatuuton par ve jhallaate the or baichaiyn ho jate the
 The flame of freedom was ignited in his child's heart
 unhone kuch swamibhakt saathiyon kaa sanghathan kiya
 As the situation progressed, his resolve to break the shackles of foreign rule became stronger
 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa vivaah san 14 may 1640 main saibai nimbalkar ke saath laal mahal, puna main hua tha
 At that time the kingdom of Bijapur was going through a period of mutual struggle and foreign invasion
 aise samrajya ke sultan kii seva karne ke badale unhone maawalon ko bijapur ke kilaaf sangathit karne lage
 Maval Pradesh is connected to the Western Ghats and is some 150 km long and 30 km wide
 ve sangharmpurn jivan vyateet karne ke kaaran kushal yoddha maane jate hai
 Marathas and people of all castes live in this region
 shivaji maharaj in sabhi jati ke logon ko lekar maawalon naam dekar sabhi ko sangathit kiya or unase sampark kar unke pradesh se parichit ho gaye the
 He had started the construction of the fort by bringing Maval youths
 maawalon kaa sahyog shivaji maharaj ke liye baad main utana hi mahatvapurn sabit hua jitna shershah suri ke liye afagaanon kaa saath
 At that time Bijapur was troubled by mutual struggle and Mughal invasion
 bijapur ke sultan adilshaah ne bahut se durgon se apni sena hataakar unhen sthaneey shaskaon yaa samanton ke haath saunp diya tha
 When Adilshah fell ill, anarchy spread in Bijapur and Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of the opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 shivaji maharaj ne iske baad ke dinon main bijapur ke durgon par adhikaar karne kii niti apanaai
 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Shivaji sent his envoy to Sultan Adilshah and informed him that he was ready to pay better money than the first fortress and handed over this area to him
 unhone adilshaah ke darbariyon ko pehle hi rishwat dekar apane paksh main kar liya tha or apane darbariyon kii salaah ke mutabik adilshaah ne shivaji maharaj ko us durg kaa adhipati bana diya
 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset
 usne shahji raaje ko apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha
 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe
 usake baad aurangzeb ne mirzaraja jaisingh ko bhejkar 23 kilon par kabja kiya baad main shiji maharaj ke mawala tanaji malusre ne kondhana durg par kabja kiya par us yuddh main vah viragati ko praapt hua uski yaad main kondana par adhikaar karne ke baad uskaa naam singhgarh rakhaa gaya
 Shahaji Raje was given the title of Poona and Soupa and the fortress of Soupa was in the hands of his relative Baji Mohite
 shivaji maharaj ne raat ke samay soopa ke durg par akraman karke durg par adhikaar kar liya or baaji mohite ko shahji raaje ke paas karnataka bhej diya
 Some part of his army also came in the service of Shivaji Maharaj
 isi samay purandar ke kiledaar kii mrityu ho gai or kile ke uttaradhikaar ke liye uske teenon beton main ladaai chhid gai
 Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar on the invitation of two brothers and, taking recourse to diplomacy, he imprisoned all the brothers
 is tarah purandar ke kile par bhi unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed
 1647 isvi tak ve chaakan se lekar nira tak ke bhubhag ke bhi adhipati ban chuke the
 With his increased military power, Shivaji Maharaj planned to enter the plains
 ek ashwarohi sena kaa gathan kar shivaji maharaj ne aabaaji sonder ke netritv main konkan ke viruddh ek sena bheji
 Abaji captured nine other fortifications including Konkan
 iske alaava taala, mosmala or raiti ke durg bhi shivaji maharaj ke adheen aa gaye the
 All the property looted was kept safe in Raigad
 kalyaan ke governor ko mukt kar shivaji maharaj ne kolaba kii ore rukh kiya or yahan ke pramukhon ko videshiyon ke kilaaf yuddh ke liye uksaaya
 Sultan of Bijapur was already in a rage before Shivaji Maharaj's antics
 usne shivaji maharaj ke pita ko bandi banane kaa aadesh de diya
 Shahaji Raje was in Karnataka at the time and was taken prisoner by a treacherous assistant Baji Ghorpade and brought to Bijapur
 un par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone qutubashah kii seva praapt karne kii koshish kii thi jo golconda kaa shaasha tha or is kaaran adilshaah kaa shatru
 After the mediation of two chieftains of Bijapur, Shahaji Maharaj was freed on the condition that he would control Shivaji Maharaj
 agle chaar varshon tak shivaji maharaj ne bijipur ke kilaaf koi akraman nahin kiya
 During this time he organized his army
 shahji kii mukti kii sharton ke mutabik shivaji rajane bijapur ke kshetron par akraman to nahin kiya par unhone dakshin-pashchim main apni shakti badhaane kii cheshtaa kii
 But in this order the state of Javali was acting as a hindrance
 yah rajya satara ke sudur uttar pashchim main vama or krishna nadi ke bich main sthit tha
 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army
 chandrarav more or uske donon putron ne shivaji ke saath ladaai kii par ant main ve bandi bana liye gaye par chandrarav bhaag gaya
 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion
 isse shivaji ko us durg main sangrahit aath vanshon kii sampatti mil gai
 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army
 shivaji ke bijapur tathaa mughal donon shatru the
 At that time, Shahzada Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Deccan
 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin
 iske parinamswaroop aurangzeb shivaji se khafaa ho gaya or maitri vaarta samaapt ho gai
 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira
 par zanjeera ke siddiyon ke saath unki ladaai kai dinon tak chali
 After this Shivaji himself invaded Janjira and took control of South Konkan and collected annual tax from the Portuguese of Daman
 kalyaan tathaa bhiwandi par adhikaar karne ke baad vahaan nausainik adda bana liya
 By this time, Shivaji had become the owner of 40 fortifications
 idhar aurangzeb ke agra laut jane ke baad bijapur ke sultan ne bhi raahat kii saans lee
 Now Shivaji was the most powerful enemy of Bijapur
 shahji ko pehle hi apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha gaya tha par shahji ne isamen apni asamarthta jaahir kii
 The Sultan of Bijapur sent Abdullah Bhatari against Shivaji to deal with Shivaji
 afajal ne 12 xxrep 4 0 sainikon ke saath 1659 main kooch kiya
 Destroying the temples of Tuljapur, he came to Shiraval, 30 km north of Satara
 par shivaji pratapgarh ke durg par hi rahe
 Afzal Khan sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar for a treaty
 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya 
 After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji took control of the fort of Panhala
 iske baad pavangadh or vasantgarh ke durgon par adhikaar karne ke saath hi saath unhone rustam khan ke akraman ko vifal bhi kiya
 With this they also captured Rajapur and Dawul
 ab bijapur main aatank kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya or vahaan ke samanton ne aapasi matbhed bhulaakar shivaji par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 2 October 1665, the Bijapuri army captured the Panhala fort
 shivaji sankat main funs chuke the par raatri ke andhkaar kaa laabh uthaakar ve bhaagane main safal rahe
 The Sultan of Bijapur, taking command himself, withdrew his authority over Panhala, Pawangarh, looted Rajapur and killed the head of Shringargarh
 isi samay karnataka main siddijohar ke vidroh ke kaaran bijapur ke sultan ne shivaji ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Shivaji's father Shahaji acted as a mediator in this treaty
 san 1662 main hui is sandhi ke anusaar shivaji ko bijapur ke sultan dwaara swatantra shaasha kii manyata mili
 According to this treaty, the area ranging from Kalyan in the north to Ponda in the south and from Indapur in the east to Davul in the west came under Shivaji's control
 shivaji kii sena main is samay tak 3 xxrep 4 0 paidal or 1000 ghudsavaar ho gaye the
 After the end of the race to become king in North India, Aurangzeb's attention shifted to the south
 wo shivaji kii badhati prabhutaa se parichit tha or usne shivaji par niyantran rakhane ke udyeshy se apane mamaa shysta khan ko dakshin kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Shaiska Khan took 1,50,000 fos and took control of the fort of Supan and Chakan and reached Poona
 usne 3 saal tak mawal main lutmar ki
 One night Shivaji attacked him with his 350 Mavalos
 shysta to khidki ke raste batch nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa par use isi kram main apni chaar anguliyon se haath dhonaa padaa
 The sons of Shaista Khan, and forty guards and countless soldiers were slaughtered
 is ghatana ke baad aurangzeb ne shysta ko dakkan ke badale bengal kaa soobedaar bana diya or shahjada muajjam shysta kii jagah lene bheja gaya
 This victory increased Shivaji's reputation
 6 saal shaista khan ne apni 15 xxrep 4 0 fuj lekar raja shivaji kaa pura mulukh jalaakar tabah kar diya tha
 Therefore, Shivaji started looting in the Mughal territories to recover his damages
 surat us samay pashchimi vyapaariyon kaa garh tha or hindustani musalamaanon ke liye haj par jane kaa dwaar
 It was a prosperous city and its port was very important
 shivaji ne chaar hajaar kii sena ke saath 1664 main chah dinon tak surat ke dhanadya vyapaariyon ko lutaa
 They did not rob the common man and then returned
 is ghatana kaa zikr dach tathaa angrejon ne apane lekhon main kiya he
 By that time, European traders had settled in India and other Asian countries
 nadir shah ke bharat par akraman karne tak kisi bhi europea shakti ne bhartiya mughal samrajya par akraman karne kii nahin sochi thi
 Disgusted by the loot of Shivaji in Surat, Aurangzeb appointed Gaiyasuddin Khan as a faujdar of Surat in place of Inayat Khan
 or shahjada muajjam tathaa upasenapati raja jaswant singh kii jagah diler khan or raja jaisingh kii niyukti kii gai
 King Jai Singh attacked Shivaji with the support of Sultan of Bijapur, European powers and small feudatories
 is yuddh main shivaji ko haani hone lagi or haar kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue shivaji ne sandhi kaa prastaav bheja
 According to this treaty in June 1665, Shivaji will give 23 fortifications to the Mughals and thus only 12 fort will be left with him
 in 23 durgon se hone vaali aamadani 4 lakh hun salanaa thi
 The areas of Balaghat and Konkan will be given to Shivaji, but he will have to pay 40 lakh Huns in 13 installments in return
 iske alaava prativarsh 5 lakh hun kaa rajasav bhi ve denge
 Shivaji himself will be free from being in Aurangzeb's court, but his son Shambhaji will have to fight in the Mughal court
 bijapur ke kilaaf shivaji mughalon kaa saath denge
 Shivaji was called to Agra where he felt that he was not getting proper respect
 iske kilaaf unhone apana rosh bhare darbar main dikhaaya or aurangzeb par vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aurangzeb was angered by this and he saw Shivaji being detained and guarded by 5000 soldiers
 kuch hi dinon baad raja shivaji ko maar daalane kaa iraadaa aurangzeb kaa tha
 But both Shivaji and Sambhaji, with their courage and courage, managed to escape from it
 sambhaaji ko mathura main ek vishwasi brahman ke yahan chhod shivaji maharaj banaras, gayi, puri hote hue sakushal rajgad pahunch gaye 
 This gave the Marathas a new life
 aurangzeb ne jaisingh par shaq karke uski hatya vish dekar karvaa daali
 Shivaji signed a second treaty with the Mughals in 1668 after Jaswant Singh took the initiative
 aurangzeb ne shivaji ko raja kii manyata di
 Shivaji's son Shambhaji received a mansabdari of 5000 and Shivaji was returned to the districts of Poona, Chakan and Soupa
 par, singhgarh or purandar par mughalon kaa adhipaty bana rahaa
 Shivaji looted Surat city for the second time in 1670
 nagar se 132 lakh kii sampatti shivaji ke haath lagi or lautate vakt unhone mughal sena ko surat ke paas phir se haraaya
 By 1674, Shivaji had captured all the territories which had to be given to the Mughals under the Treaty of Purandar
 pashchimi maharashtra main swatantra hindu raashtra kii sthapana ke baad shivaji ne apana rajbhishek karnaa chaha, parantu muslim sainiko ne brahamanon ko dhamkee di ki jo bhi shivaji kaa rajbhishek karegaa unki hatya kar di jaayegi
 jab ye baat shivaji tak pahunchi kii mughal sardaar aise dhamkee de rahe he tab shivaji ne ise ek chunauti ke rup me liya or kaha kii ab wo us rajya ke brahamn se hi abhishek karavaayenge jo mughalon ke adhikaar main he
 shivaji ke nijee sachiv balaji ji ne kaashi main teen duto ko bheja, cunki kaashi mughal samrajya ke adheen tha
 jab duuton ne sandesh diya to kaashi ke brahamn kaaphi prasann huye
 kintu mughal sainiko ko yah baat pataa chal gai tab un brahmano ko pakad liya
 parantu yukti purvak un brahmanon ne mughal sannico ke samaksh un duuton se kaha ki shivaji koun he ham nahin jaanate he
 ve kis vansh se hai ? duuton ko pataa nahin tha isaliye unhone kaha hamen pataa nahin he
 tab mughal sainiko ke sardaar ke samaksh un brahmanon ne kaha ki hamen kahin anyatra janaa he, shivaji kis vansh se hai aapane nahin bataaya at: aise main ham unke rajbhishek kaisekar sakate hai
 ham to tirth yatra par ja rahe hai or kashika koi anya brahman bhi rajbhishek nahin karegaa jab tak raja kaa purna parichay na ho at: aap waapas ja sakate hai
 mughal sardaar ne khush hoke brahmano ko chod diya or duto ko pakad kar aurangzeb ke paas dilli bhejne kii sochi par wo bhi chup ke se nikal bhaage
 waapas laut kar unhone ye baat balaji aav tathaa shivaji ko bataai
 parantu aashcharya janak rup se do din baad vahi brahman apane shishyon ke saath raigarh pahuchen ore shivaji kaa rajbhishek kiya
 After this, the Mughals tried to divide and even after the coronation of Shivaji, threatened the Brahmins of Poona that they should not accept Shivaji as the king
 So that people do not even consider it !! But they did not work
 Shivaji established the Ashtapradhan Mandal
 Apart from the envoys, representatives of various states, foreign traders were also invited to this ceremony
 par unke rajbhishek ke 12 din baad hi unki mata kaa dehanth ho gaya tha is kaaran se 4 oktober 1674 ko duusari baar shivaji ne chhatrapati kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 The ceremony, which took place twice, cost about 50 lakh rupees
 is samaaroh main hindu swaraj kii sthapana kaa udghosh kiya gaya tha
 It was the first Hindu kingdom in the south after the fall of Vijayanagar
 ek swatantra shaasha kii tarah unhone apane naam kaa sikaa chalavaaya
 After this, the Sultan of Bijapur sent two of his commanders against Shivaji for the Konkan victory but they failed
 san 1677-78 main shivaji kaa dhyaan karnataka kii ore gaya
 On April 4, 1680, Shivaji passed away after commanding Konkan in south of Bombay, Belgaum and Dharwad region west of Tungabhadra river, Mysore, Valari, Trichur and Jinji
 teen saptaah kii beemaari ke baad shivaji kii mrityu 3 april 1680 main hui
 At that time, Sambhaji inherited Shivaji's succession
 shivaji ke jyeshtha putr sambhaji the or dusi patni se rajaraam naam ek doosraa putr tha
 At that time Rajaram was only 10 years old, so the Marathas accepted Shambhaji as the king
 us samay aurangzeb raja shivaji kaa dehant dekhakar apni puure bharat par rajya karne ki abhilasha se apni 5,00,000 sena sagar lekar dakshin bharat jeetne niklaa
 Aurangzeb finished Adilshi in 2 days and Qutb Shahi in 1 day
 par raja sambhaji ke netritv main marathao ne 9 saal yuddh karte huye apni swatantrata barkaraar rakhi
 Aurangzeb's son Shahzada Akbar revolted against Aurangzeb
 sambhaji ne usko apane yahan sharan di
 Aurangzeb now vigorously started attacking against Sambhaji
 usne antatah 1689 main sambhaji ke bivi ke sage bhai ne yane ganoji shirke kii mukhabari se sambhaji ko mukarav khan dwaara bandi bana liya
 Aurangzeb misbehaved with Raja Sambhaji and miserably killed him
 apni raja ko aurangzeb ne badasluki or buree haal maaraa hua dekhakar pura maratha swarajya krodhit hua
 He continued his struggle with the Mughals under the leadership of the Third Rajaram with his full strength
 1700 isvi main rajaraam kii mrityu ho gai
 After that Rajaram's wife Tarabai ruled as guardian of 4-year-old son Shivaji II
 aakhirkaar 25 saal maratha swarajya ke yuddh lad ke thake huye aurangzeb kii usee chhatrapati shivaji ke swarajya main dafan huye
 Shivaji is known as a skilled and enlightened emperor
 yadhyapi unako apane bachapan main parmparik shiksha kuch khaas nahin mili thi, par ve bhartiya itihaas or raajnneeti se suparichit the
 He considered Shukracharya and Kautilya to be ideal and resorted to diplomacy many times
 apane samakaleen mughalon kii tarah vah bhi nirankush shaasha the, arthath shashan kii samoochee bagdor raja ke haath main hi thi
 But there was a council of eight ministers called Ashtapradhan to help with his administrative work
 isamen mantriyon ke pradhan ko peshwa kehete the jo raja ke baad sabase pramukh hasti tha
 Amatya used to look after the functions of finance and revenue, then the minister used to take care of the personal diary of the king
 sachiv dafatari kaam karte the jisame shahi muhar lagaana or sandhi patron kaa aalekh taiyaar karnaa shaamil hote the
 Sumant was the foreign minister
 sena ke pradhan ko senapati kehete the
 The head of charity and religious affairs was called Panditrao
 nyaayadhish nyaayik maamalon kaa pradhan tha
 The Maratha Empire was divided into three or four divisions
 prayek praant main ek soobedaar tha jise prantapati kaha jaataa tha
 Each Subedar also had an Ashtapradhan Committee
 kuch praant keval karadaata the or prashasan ke maamle main swatantra
 The judiciary was based on the ancient system
 shukracharya, kautilya or hindu dharamshastron ko aadhaar maanakar nirnay diya jaataa tha
 The Patel of the village used to investigate criminal cases
 rajya kii aay kaa saadhan bhoomikar tha par chouth or sardeshmukhi se bhi rajasav vasula jaataa tha
 'chauth' was a tax levied to guarantee the security of neighboring states
 shivaji apane ko maraathon kaa sardeshmukh kahata the or isi haisiyat se sardeshmukhi kar vasula jaataa tha
 After the coronation, he entrusted the work of one of his ministers to form suitable Sanskrit words for the Persian words used in the government
 ramachandra amaatya ne dhundhiraj naamak vidwaan kii sahaayta se 'rajyavyavahaarkosh' naamak granth nirmit kiya
 This dictionary had Sanskrit words equivalent to 1380 Persian administrative words
 isamen ramachandra ne likhaa he- Shivaji was a devoted Hindu and he was also religious tolerant
 unke samrajya main musalamaanon ko dharmik swatantraaa thi
 Shivaji gave grants for the construction of many mosques
 hindu panditon kii tarah musalmaan santon or fakiron ko bhi sammaan praapt tha
 There were also Muslim soldiers in his army
 shivaji hindu sankruti ko badhaava dete the
 The emphasis was on traditional Hindu values and education
 vah apane abhiyaanon kaa armbh bhi akasar dashahra ke avasar par karte the
 Shivaji Maharaj got Swaraj's education from his father, when the Sultan of Bijapur made Shahji Raje a prisoner, then like an ideal son he made a treaty with the Shah of Bijapur and got Shahji Raje released
 isse unke charitra main ek udaar avyav hojar aata he
 Later, he did not kill his father as other emperors did
 shahji raaje ke marane ke baad hi unhone apana rajbhishek karavaaya hanlanki wo us samay tak apane pita se swatantra hokar ek bade samrajya ke adhipati ho gayi the
 His leadership was accepted by everyone, that is why there was no major incident like internal rebellion during his reign
 vah ek achche senanayake ke saath ek achche kootneetijna bhi the

 This firm rule applies only to the universal use of magnets, while in the case of endemic use, more attention is given to disease infection, pain, swelling etc
 uttam parinaam hasil karne ke liye jab rog athwa uskaa prasar sharir ke upree bhaag arthath naabhi se upar ho to chumbakon ko hatheliyon par lagaaya jaataa he, jabaki sharir ke nichle bhaagon arthath naabhi se neeche vidyaman rogon main chumbakon ko talvon main lagaaya jaataa he
 In this, magnets are placed in places that are diseased, such as the knees and feet, painful vertebrae, eyes, nose, etc

 They are described here - is prayog vidhi ke anusaar uttari dhruv tathaa dakshini dhrav se sampann chumbakon kaa ek joda liya jaataa he
 Depending on the electrical correlation of the body, generally the north pole magnet is used on the right parts of the body, forward and north, while the south pole magnet is used on the left, back and lower parts of the body
 is done
 yah atal niyam chumbakon ke sarvadaihik prayog par hi lagu hota he, jabaki sthanik prayog kii avasthaa main rog sankraman, dard, sujan aadi par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 To get the best results, when the disease or its spread is above the upper part of the body ie the navel, the magnets are applied to the palms, while in the diseases of lower parts of the body, ie below the navel, the magnets are applied to the soles
 is prayog vidhi main chumbakon ko un sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he, jo rogagrast hote hai, jaise- ghutana or pair, dardanaak kasheruka, aankh, naak aadi
 According to the intensity and form of the disease, one, two and even three magnets can be used
 udaahranarth- ghutane tathaa gardan ke tej dard main do chumbakon ko alag-alag ghutanon par tathaa tisare chumbak ko gardan kii dardanaak kasheruka par lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The method of this experiment is also useful in the case of endemic disease infection
 anguthe main tej dard hone jaisi kuch avasthaaon main kabhi-kabhi donon chumbakon ke dhruvon ke bich angutha rakhane se turant aaraam miltaa he
 It is beneficial for males and females of all ages
 chumbakon ke madhyam se ilaaj itnaa sidhaa-sada he ki yah kisi bhi samay, kisi bhi sthaan par or sharir ke kisi bhi ang par aajamaaya ja saktaa he

 For this reason, magnets have an effect on all diseases, pain goes away and disorders of body functions are cured
 chumbak kaa aakaar or dizin is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki use sharir ke kis bhaag par lagaana he
 There are some parts of the body, where large size magnets cannot be installed, small magnets will not work properly on some parts
 udhaaharan ke liye agar aankh par chumbak lagaana ho to chote aakaar kaa gol chumbak hona chahie, jo band aankh ke upar aa jaae
 On the other hand, if there is pain or swelling in most parts of the body, then a large size magnet will be applied
 isliye ek hi aakaar-prakaar ke chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke vibhinn bhaagon par nahin ho saktaa
 The same thing applies to the power of magnets
 sharir ke kuch komal ang jaise mastishk, aankh or hriday jahaan adhik shakti vaale chumbak nahin lagane chahie or na madhyam shakti ke chumbak adhik der tak lagane chahie
 Conversely, low-power magnets will not suffice for diseases of stiff and large muscles or bones, such as those of the hips, thighs, knees, or ankles
 na keval sthaneey rogon, balki saare sharir ke liye chumbakon ke chunaav main in baton kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 It is necessary that the patient does not have contact with the ground or any iron item while taking treatment
 atah lohe kii kursi yaa palang varjit he, jabaki lakdi kii kursi yaa palang adarsh he
 The position of the magnets should be such that the North Pole is towards North and South Pole should be towards South
 isse chumbak kaa kshetra prithvi ke chumbakeey kshetra ke samanaantar rahegaa or chumbak adhik prabhaavshaalee banenge
 If two different poles of two magnets are being used at the same time, then the patient should face towards the west, so that the right part of his body is towards the north and the left side is towards the south
 aisa upyukt mana gaya he ki chumbakon kaa sthanik athwa sarvadaihik prayog 10 minute se 30 minute tak samichin rahata he
 For chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults, the use of magnets for the first one week should be only for 10 minutes and this period should be gradually increased to 30 minutes
 anya kai rogavasthaon main bhi tadnusaar samay badhaayaa janaa chahie
 The more powerful magnets should be reduced accordingly
 jab mastishk jaise komalangon par chumbak kaa prayog karnaa ho, to yah acchhee tarah samaj len ki isamen shaktishaalee chumbak nahin lagaae jate
 Magnet should never be used for more than 10 minutes

 6
 At the time of treatment, the jewel or such objects should be removed from the body which exploit the magnetism
 kuch bijli ke upkaran tathaa ghadiyaan bhi chumbakon ke prabhaav se nasht ho sakati hai, yadi unhen chumbakon se dur nahin rakhaa jaae
 Hence magnets should be kept away from them
 7
 jab chumbakon kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa to unke upar dharak rakhkar acchhee tarah sambhaal dena chahie

 Ozone depletion or ozone depletion describes two distinct but related observations; Since the 1970s, there has been a slow but steady decrease in the total amount of ozone in the Earth's stratosphere by about four percent per decade; and there is a greater but seasonal decrease in the ozone of the stratosphere over the Earth's polar regions during the same period is

 In addition to this well-known stratospheric ozone depletion, there have also been occurrences of tropospheric ozone depletion, which occur near the surface of polar regions during spring

 It is suspected that a variety of biological consequences are due to increased skin cancer, plant damage, decreased plankton population in the ocean light area, increased ultraviolet rays due to ozone depletion
 parabegni kirnon ke kaaran ozon kaa hraas hota he
 The three upper forms of oxygen are involved in the ozone-oxygen cycle: oxygen atoms, oxygen gases, and ozone gases
 ozon kaa nirmaan samtap mandal main tab hota he jab oxigen ke anu 240 nm se chote tarang dairdhya ke ek parabangnee photone ko avashoshit karke prakaash apaghatit ho jate hai
 It forms two atoms of oxygen
 ab parmanvik oxigen O2 ke saath sanyojit hokar O3 banaati he
 The ozone molecule absorbs UV light between 310 and 200 nm, causing the ozone to split into an oxygen atom and an O2 molecule
 ab oxigen parmaanu oxigen anu ke saath sanyojit hokar fir se ozon anu banaata he
 This is a continuous process that ends when an oxygen atom "recombines" with an ozone molecule to form two O2 molecules
 o + O3 → 2 O2 The total amount of ozone in the stratosphere is determined by a balance between photochemical production and recombination
 ozon ko mukt mulak utprerak kii ek sankhya ke dwaara nasht kiya ja saktaa he, isamen se sabase mahatvapurn he hydroxil mulak ,nitric oxide mulak or parmaanu chlorine or bromine 
 All of these have both natural and synthetic sources; at the present time, the majority of OH and NO
 It has a natural origin in the stratosphere, but human activity has resulted in dramatically higher increases in oxygen chlorine and bromine
 cfcl3 + hν → cfcl2 + Cl Now the atoms of chlorine and bromine destroy ozone molecules through several decomposition cycles
 is tarah ke ek chakra ke saralatam udhaaharan main, ek chlorine parmaanu ek ozon anu ke saath, kriya karata he, iske ek oxigen parmaanu ko lekar clo bana letaa he or ek oxigen anu ko mukt kar detaa he
 Chlorine monoxide reacts with another molecule of ozone to form another chlorine atom and two oxygen molecules

 Bromine is more effective than chlorine in destroying ozone on an atomic basis
 lekin vartmaan main vaataavaran main kam maatra main bromine he
 As a result, both chlorine and bromine contribute significantly to overall ozone depletion

 Instead, laboratory tests that show stratospheric conditions indicate that the magnitude of the molecule's decay is less than the amount previously thought

 However, holes in ozone are not measured in these levels as a decrease in the concentration of ozone but by a decrease in the total column ozone above one point of the ground surface

 The marked decrease in Antarctic spring and warmth in this column ozone has been compared to the early 1970s using tools such as total ozone mapping spectrometers

 Chlorine-catalyzed ozone depletion can occur in the gas phase, but it increases dramatically in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds
 ye dhruviya samtap mandaleey badal sardi main, atyadhik thand main banate hai
 Polar winters are very deep, sunlight cannot be seen for about three months
 na keval surya kaa prakaash main kami taap ko kam karti he balki dhruviya bhavar ko jakad kar thanda kar detii he
 The temperature remains below about -80 ° C, these low temperatures make clouds of clouds, they are made of either nitric acid or ice
 donon prakaar rasinic abhikriyaaon ke liye sataha uplabdh karte hai, jo ozon ke vinaash kaa kaaran hai
 Photochemical activity is complex but understandable
 kunjee avlokan yah he ki saamanyatya, samtap mandal main adhikansh chlorine sthaayee "bhandar " yogikon main rahati he, praathmik rup se hydrogen chloride or chlorine nitrate 
 The reaction on the surface of polar stratospheric cloud particles during Antarctic winter and spring transforms these "reservoir" compounds into reaction free radicals
 badal vayumandal main se no2ko bhi hataa dete hai, ve ise nitric amla main badal dete hai, yah nav nirmit clo ko clono2main parivartit hone se roktaa he
 Antarctic ozone depletion occurs most during spring due to the role of sunlight in ozone depletion
 sardiyon ke dauraan, haalanki pscs apni adhiktam maatra main hote hai, dhruv ke upar rasinic abhikriya ke liye koi prakaash nahin hota he
 During the spring season, however, the sun rises and provides energy for photochemical reactions and melts the polar stratospheric clouds, freeing the aggregates in it
 adhikansh nasht hui ozon nichle samtap mandal main hoti he, iske vipareet sajaateey gas charan pratikriyaaon, ke madhyam se bahut kam ozon riktikaran hota he, jo praarambhik rup se upari samtap mandal main hota he
 The heat-giving temperature near the end of spring breaks the vortex in mid-december

 Although the Antarctic ozone hole has little effect in reducing global ozone, it is estimated to be 4% per decade, the hole has generated much interest because: chunki ozon parat surya ke UVB ko avashoshit karti he, atah ozon parat riktikaran sataha UVB ke str main vruddhi kar saktaa he, yah kshati kaa kaaran ho saktaa he yah twachaa cancer kii sambhaavna ko badhaata he
 This was the reason for the Montreal Protocol
 yadhyapi samtap mandal kii ozon main kami siefasi se sambandhit he, ozon main kami satahi UVB main vruddhi karegi is par vishwaas karne ke liye paryaapt kaaran hai, ozon kii kami ko maanav main twachaa cancer ke badhane se sambandhit karne vaale pratyaksh pramaan uplabdh nahin hai
 This is partly due to the fact that UVA is effective in many types of skin cancers, it is not absorbed by ozone, it is impossible to control statistics for lifestyle changes in most populations
 ozon jo prithvi ke vayumandal main ek alpsankhyak ghatak he, UVB vikiran ke adhikansh avasorana ke ke liye jimmedaar he
 The amount of UVB radiation that passes through the ozone layer exponentially decreases with the slope path thickness / density of the layer
 is se sambandhit ek tathy yah bhi he ki vayumandal main ozon main kami sataha ke paas UVB ke str main ullekhneey vruddhi ke liye jimmedaar hogi
 The increase in surface UVB due to the ozone hole can be partially hindered by radiation transfer model calculations
 lekin kyonki vishwasaneey aitihaasik sataha yuvi data main kami ke kaaran ise pratyaksh gananaaon ke dwaara mapa nahin ja saktaa he, yadhyapi adhik haal hi ke avlokan maap kaaryakramon ke udhaaharan upasthit hai
 Because it is the same parabengy radiation that forms O2 to ozone in the ozone layer, the reduction of ozone in the stratosphere increases the photochemical production of ozone at lower levels, although) overall analysis still shows a decrease in the column of ozone
 , Because the ozone produced in the lower levels naturally has a shorter life span, so before it can supply damaged ozone, it Specific cause is
 ozon chhidr ke bare main mukhya saarvajanik chintaa kaa vishay he;maanav swasthya par sataha yuvi kaa prabhaav
 adhiktar sthanon main ab tak, ozon riktikaran kuch hi pratishat he, adhikansh aakshanshon main swasthya kshati ke koi pratyaksh pramaan nahin mili hai
 High levels of depletion in the ozone hole are common worldwide, the effects may be more dramatic
 antarctic par ozon hole kuch udaahranon main itnaa bada ho gaya he ki australia or newjiland, ke dakshini bhaagon tak pahunch gaya he, paryaavaranvaadiyon ke anusaar satahi yu ve main vruddhi mahatvapurn ho sakati he
 UVB is commonly accepted as an adjunct to skin cancer
 iske alaava, satahi yu ve main vruddhi, kshobh mandal kii ozon main vruddhi karti he, jo maanav ke swasthya ke liye jokhim he
 An increase in surface UV represents an increase in the ability of sunlight to synthesize vitamin D
 vitamin di ke cancer nirodhak prabhaav ozon riktikaran ke ek sambhavit laabhadaayak prabhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In terms of health costs, the potential benefits of increased UV radiation can increase the burden

 Malignant melanoma - Another form of skin cancer, malignant melanoma, is less common but more dangerous, being fatal in about 15% - 20% of the cases diagnosed
 ghaatak melanoma or parabangnee kirann ke bich sambandh abhi tak thik prakaar se gyaat nahin he, lekin aisa prathit hota he ki donon UVB or UVA shaamil hai machhlee par prayog darshaate hai ki 90 se 95% ghaatak melanoma UVA or drishy vikiran ke kaaran hote hai
 Whereas experiments on oposum indicate a greater role of UVB
 is anischitata ke kaaran yah anumaan laganaa mushkil he ki melanoma kii ghatana par ozon riktikaran kaa kya prabhaav padataa he
 One study shows that a 10% increase in UVB radiation increases melanoma by 19% in men and 16% in women
 chilike dakshini sheersh panta arenas main logon par kiya gaya ek adhyayan darshata he ki ozon main kami or UVB staron main vruddhi ke saath saat varshon main melanoma main 56% kii vruddhi or gaiyr melanoma twachaa cancer main 46% kii vruddhi hui
