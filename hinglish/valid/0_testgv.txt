 According to this theory, words can be solved with jothode, they have no special significance in the language
 jaise khed yaa sahanubhuti vyakt karne ke liye ‘c-c’, ‘t-t’ aadi kaa rup sandehatmak he isliye use kuch bhi adhyayan-vishleshan kaa aadhaar nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 In Hindi, it is called 'shram Parivarunamoolatism'
 nvaare naamak prasiddh vidvan dwaara is siddhanth kaa sutarapaat kiya gaya
 According to this theory, when a person is laboring, due to the rapid pace of breathing, a vibrator is automatically formed in the larynx that produces some natural sounds
 aadi maanav jab samuhik shram karte the to unke mukh se kuch dhvaniyaan nikal padati hongi jaisi ham dhobiyon ke mukh se ‘hiyo-hiyo’, ‘chhiyo-chhiyo’, tathaa mallahon ke mukh se ‘haiyaa ho’, hathaudaa chalaane vaale mazdoor ke munh se ‘hoon-hoon’ kii dhvaniyaan nikalate hue praayah dekhte hai
 In English, 'heave' and 'hall' are verbs formed by the sounds 'yo-hee-ho'
 samiksha This theory has the following errors: nishkarsh Words formed on the basis of this principle do not solve the problem of the origin of language
 prasiddh samajashastri, angrez vakil e
 es
 diamand ko ek pracheen bhashaa ‘ore’ main ek bhi shabd aisa nahin mila jo is siddhanth par aadhaarit ho
 Therefore, in relation to such languages, this theory is a complete failure
 is siddhanth main vishwaas karne vaale iske janmdata dow raye, ‘richard’ tathaa jehansan hai
 According to this theory, when a man drank water, he used to make a sound like 'pa-pa'
 jisase ‘pipaasa’ jaise shabd bane
 Analysis maanav apni hi dhvaniyon kaa uccharan karegaa yah adhik vishwasaneey prathit nahin hota
 The conclusion sari bhashaa kii utpatti kii drushti se ye dhvaniyaan bahut alp hai
 They do not solve the problem of language-origin
 prasiddh vidwaan ji
 reves iske janmdata hai
 According to this theory, when a primitive human being came into contact with a group, first some sounds must have come out of his mouth and later words and then language were born
 in vidvan ke anusaar pehle bhashaa main kriya pad bane honge or baad main anya shabd
 Analysis manovigyaan ke aadhaar par is siddhanth main kuch tathy to prathit hota he parantu keval inhen shabdon ke dwaara sampoorn bhashaa kii utpatti ke prashn kaa samaadhaan praapt nahin hota
 Imagination and inference have been resorted to in this theory
 nishkarsh We can only give partial importance to the theory in the origin or development of language
 prasiddh vidvan cosidy bhi is siddhanth ko apurna maanate hai
 Most of the above mentioned principles are not able to solve the problem of the origin of language, that is why scholars have tried to find a solution to this problem by coordinating those three-four principles which have more quantity of partial solution
 is prakaar is samasya kaa samaadhaan khojane kaa prayaas auchitypurna prathit hota he
 Renowned scholar Henry Sweet has done the same thing
 unhone kisi naye siddhanth ko na khoj kar ‘anukaran siddhanth’ ‘aaveg siddhanth’ ‘pratik siddhanth’ or ‘upachaar-siddhanth’ kaa samanvit rup hi prastut kiya he
 Here the simulation principle under the simulation principle should also be considered as coordinated because the simulation of the sounds remains the same in both
 bhashaa main aavegatmak shabdon kii sthiti bhi avashya rahi hogi kyonki sabhi bhashaaon main is prakaar ke milte julate shabd dikhaai dete hai
 Apart from both the above types of words, we can also find a solution to this problem by 'symbol theory'
 prarambh main bhashaa kaa sthool, vastumulak rup dekhne main aata he baad main usamen sookshmata, lakshanikta or vyanjana shakti kaa vikaas hota he
 Earlier, some sounds in the language which were used in the macro economies later came to be used in the subtle sense
 is prakaar bhashaa ke pratikon kaa dhwani-pratikon ke rup main vikaas hua
 If the treatment principle is included in the same way as the 'symbol theory', then a large group of words used in the language is resolved
 upachaar kaa arth he- gyaat ke aadhaar par agyaat kii vyakhya
 Treatment or analogy also plays an important role in moving the language from physicality to subtlety
 dakshini africa kii ‘sasutho’ bhashaa main mackhiyon kii bhinbhinane kii dhwani ke aadhaar par unka naam ‘natsi-natsi’ kaha jaataa he
 Later, for his fickle person who keeps going round, he also started saying 'natsi-natsi'
 sanskrit main ‘vyarth’ or kup dhaatuen pehle bhautik padaarthon ke compann or gati ko prakat karti thi, jaise- ‘vyathmana prithvi’ tathaa ‘kupitah parvatah’ kaa arth ‘kaanpati hui prithvi’ tathaa ‘chalata hua pahaad’ tha
 Over time, the terms 'meaningless' and 'anger' for the expressions of human beings came to mean 'mental misery' and 'anger'
 samiksha Even though there is enough truth in Sweet's coordination theory, it cannot be considered completely absolute because the problem of origin of language cannot be completely solved by this principle
 nishkarsh Many theories were created regarding the origin of language, but all of them have been proved to be insignificant from the point of view of scientific study of the language, because they are based on all imagination and conjecture, only they are mentioned in the history of this question

 vastav main abhi tak bhashaa kii utpatti ke prashn kaa koi sarvamaanya or uchit samaadhaan nahin khoja ja sakaa he

 The Hindustan Republican Association, also known as HRA for short, was a major revolutionary party of North India before the independence of India, with the aim of freeing Hindustan from British rule, some of Uttar Pradesh and Bengal It was done in Kanpur in 1924 by revolutionaries

 After the Kakori incident, when four revolutionaries were hanged and sixteen major HRA revolutionaries were sentenced to life imprisonment from four years, this organization was shattered
 baad main ise chandrasekhar aaazaad ne bhagat singh ke saath milakar punerjeevit kiya or ek nayaa naam diya hindustan socialist republican association
 From 1924 to 1931, for almost eight years, this organization dominated the whole of India, as a result, not only the British government but the British government, the forty-six year old Congress Party established in 1885, was forced to change its basic policies
 janvari 1923 main motilal nehru va deshbandhu chitaranjan das sareekhe dhanadhy logon ne milakar swaraj party bana lee
 The young men announced the Revolutionary Party as the ad hoc party
 sitambar 1923 main hue dilli ke vishesh congress adhiveshan main asantusht navayuvakon ne yah nirnay liya ki ve bhi apni party kaa naam va samvidhan aadi nishchit kar raajnneeti main dakhal dena shuru karenge anyathaa desh main loktantr ke naam par luutatantra haaavee ho jaayegaa
 Lala Hardayal, who was working in those days to strategize to free India from abroad, was in contact with Ram Prasad 'bismil' since Swami Somdev
 lala ji ne hi patr likhakar bismil ko shachindranath sanyaal va yadu gopal mukherjee se milakar nayi party kaa samvidhan taiyaar karne kii salaah di thi
 Following the advice of Lala ji, Bismil went to Allahabad and prepared the party's constitution at Shachindranath Sanyal's house
 navgathit party kaa naam sankshep main echaare rakhaa gaya va iskaa samvidhan pile rang ke parche par tip karke sadasyon ko bheja gaya
 On 3 October 1924, an executive meeting of this party was held in Kanpur, in which many prominent members of Shachindranath Sanyal, Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee and Ram Prasad Bismil etc
 attended
 is baithak main party kaa netritv bismil ko saunpkar sanyaal va chatarji bengal chale gayi
 These youths were having a lot of difficulty in collecting party funds
 angrezon ke dar se koi inhen chandaa detaa na tha or yuvakon ke apane gharon kii mali haalat acchhee na thi
 Eventually they adopted the method of revolutionaries of Ireland and with the intention of raising money for the party fund, the first robbery took place on the night of 25 December 1924 in Bamrauli which was led by Bismil
 
 On January 1, 1925, a four-page advertisement was published by HRA on behalf of the revolutionary
 ise 28 se 31 janvari 1925 ke bich hindustan ke sabhi pramukh sthanon par vitarit kiya gaya
 This was the open manifesto of this party which was deliberately printed in English as The Revolutionary so that even the British could understand its meaning
 isamen vijay kumaar ke chhadam naam se ech0aar0e0 kii vichaar-dhara kaa khulaasa karte hue saafe shabdon main ghoshit kiya gaya tha ki krantikari is desh kii shashan vyavastha main kis prakaar kaa badlaav karnaa chaahate hai or iske liye ve kya-kya kar sakate hai
 Making a mockery of Gandhiji's policies in this letter, the question was also raised that "this person presents himself as a spiritual being, but in speaking openly with the British, his wind blows
" iskaa rahasy kya he?" ghoshnaa-patr main hindustan ke sabhi naujavaanon ko "aise chhadmaveshi mahatma" ke bahekaave main na aane kii salaah bhi di gayi thi
 Apart from this, an open call was made for all the youths to join hands in this secret revolutionary party and give a hand to the British
 di revolutionari ke naam se angrezi main prakashit is ghoshnaptr main krantikariyon ke vaicharik chintan ko bhalee-bhanti samajha ja saktaa he
 The manifesto published by the Hindustan Republican Association and the party's constitution, two leaders of the party who reached Bengal - were arrested while distributing leaflets at Shachindranath Sanyal Bankura and were caught by the train at Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee Howrah station
 un donon ko alag-alag jelon main band kar diya gaya
 With the arrest of these two leaders, the responsibility of the entire party came on the shoulders of Bismil
 party ke kaary hetu dhan kii aavashyaktaa to pehle se hi thi kintu ab or bad gayi thi
 Seeing that money could not be obtained from anywhere, on March 7, 1925, Bichpuri and Dwarkapur on May 24, 1925, committed two robberies, but nothing special came into them
 ulte in donon dakaitiyon main ek-ek vyakti bhi maukey par maaraa gaya
 Eventually he decided that now only the government treasury would be looted
 antatogatva shahjahanpur main bismil ke ghar par hui ek apatkaaleen baithak main angreji sarkaar kaa khajaana luutane kii yojana bani
 According to this plan, on August 9, 1925, in front of Kakori railway station in Lucknow district, the eight down saharanpur-lucknow Passenger train was pulled by a chain and all ten revolutionaries escaped after looting the government treasury kept in it
 angrej sarkaar ne hindustan republican asosiyeshan ke kul 40 krantikariyon ko puure hindustan main sthaan-sthaan par chapa markar giraftaar kiya or un sabko lakhanu laakar kakori kand ko sajeesh qaraar diya
 After this, the British government prosecuted the leader of the party Ram Prasad 'bismil' and all other HRA members for waging an armed war against the emperor, looting the government treasury and killing the passengers
 lagbhag atharah maheene tak chale is mukademen main rajendranath lahidi, ram prasad bismil, ashfak ulla khan tathaa roshan singh ko phaansi sajaa di gayi jabaki 16 anya krantikariyon ko kam se kam 4 varsh kii sajaa se lekar adhiktam aaajeevan karawas tak kaa dand diya gaya
 The incident devastated the association
 kakori kand se faraar bismil ke sachche uttaradhikari pandit chandrasekhar aaazaad ne yuva krantikari bhagat singh ke saath milakar dilli ke ferojshah kotla maidan main ek gupt meeting karke is dal ko punerjeevit kiya or sanghathan ko ek nayaa naam diya hindustan socialist republican association
 In this way, from 1924 to 1931, for almost 8 years, this organization was worshiped throughout India, as a result of which not only the British Government but also the 46 years old Congress Party of that time established in 1885 from the British knot Had to change

 is samaaroh main ek parmaanu ke kisi bhi electron paane kii sambhaavna kii gananaa karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa parmaanu ke nabhik ke chaaron ore kisi bhi vishisht kshetra main
 The term, atomic orbital, can also refer to the physical region or location where the electron, as the orbital, can be calculated to present a special mathematically defined presence
 ek parmaanu main prayek kakshiya teen kwantum sankhya n, l, or meter ke mulyon, jo kramshah electron kii urja, koniya gati, or ek koniya gati vector ghatak ke anuroop kii ek adwitiya set kii visheshta he
 In this way each orbital with two electrons can have its own spin quantum number occupied by a maximum of each

 The electron cloud of a multi-electron atom being constructed in this model can be seen as an electron configuration that is a product of simple hydrogen-like atomic orbitals kwantum yantriki or prayogtmak nishkarshon ke vikaas ke saath, yah paaya gaya he ki ek nabhik ke chaaron ore parikrama electronon ko puri tarah se kanon ke rup main varnit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, lekin lahar kan dwandv se samajhaayaa ja karne kii jarurat he
 In this sense, electrons have the following properties: lahar kii tarah gun:1

 The lowest possible energy an electron can carry is therefore corresponding to the fundamental frequency of a wave on a wire

 Electrons are never in a point location, although the possibility of interaction with the electron at a single point can be found by the wave function of the electron

 Particle-like properties to retain electrons: Each wave state is in charge of the same electric charge as the electron particle

 Thus, despite the apparent resemblance to planets revolving around the Sun, electrons cannot be described as just solid particles
 iske alaava, parmaanu kakshaon baariki se saadhaaran parmaanuon main ek grah kii andakar path samaan nahin he
 a more precise analogy may be that a large and often oddly shaped "atmosphere" is distributed around a relatively small planet
 parmaanu kakshaon vastav main is " vaataavaran" ke aakaar kaa varnan he jab keval ek electron ek parmaanu main maujuud he
 The more electrons are added to an atom, the more electrons fill a volume of space more evenly around the nucleus so that the resulting collection leads to a generally spherical region to describe the possibility
 For where atoms will get electrons

 Atomic orbitals can be hydrogen-like "orbitals" which are exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen-like "atom"
 vaikalpik rup se, parmaanu kakshaon kaary karata he ki ek electron ke samanvay par nirbhar karti he lekin lahar kaary karata he ki ek parmaanu yaa anu main sabhi electronon kaa ek saath nirdeshaank par nirbhar anumaan karne ke liye ank shuru karne ke rup main istemaal kar rahe hai ke liye dekhen
 The coordinate system chosen for atomic orbitals is typically spherical coordinates of atoms and molecules in polyatomic in Cartesian
 golakaar nirdeshaank kaa laabh ek kakshiya lahar samaaroh teen karkon prayek nirbhar kaa ek utpaada he us par ek bhi samanvay sthapit he : ψ = r θ φ

 Functions as real combinations of spherical rhythms Ylm shabd " kakshiya " ek electron kakshiya lahar samaaroh ke liye ek sankshipt naam ke rup main 1932 main robert mullikkan dwaara gadha gaya tha
 However, the idea that electrons may revolve around a compact nucleus with fixed angular momentum was argued at least 19 years ago by Niels Bohr, and an orbit-based approach to electronic behavior by Japanese physicist Hanataro Ngoka The hypothesis published as early as 1904 explained the behavior of electron "orbits" as the driving force behind the development of quantum One of the wing forces was mechanics
 je je ke saath 1897 main electron kii thomson kii khoj, yah spasht ho gaya he ki parmaanu prakruti ke sabase chote blokon kaa nirmaan nahin the, balki samgr kanon the
 Many examinations imagine the structure of newly discovered structures within atoms, how atomic component parts may interact with each other
 thomson ne anumaan lagaaya he ki kai electronon ek sakaaratmak aarope lagaaya jelly jaisaa padaarth ke bheetar kaksha - tarah ke challe main gumti he, or electron kii khoj or 1909 ke bich, is " ber kaa halava model" parmaanu sanrachana kaa sabase vyapak rup se sweekaar vivaran tha
 Shortly after Thomson's discovery, Hanataaro Nagaoka predicted a different model for electronic structure
 ber kaa halava model ke vipareet, nagaoka ke " saturnean model" main sakaaratmak charge ek kendriya kor main kendrit tha ,shani ke challe kii yaad taaja paripatr kakshaon main electronon khinch
 Some people took notice of Nagioka's work at the time, and Nagaoka himself also recognized in principle a fundamental flaw on his concept, namely that it is a classical charged object because it is fast not to maintain orbital motion
 And therefore loses energy due to electromagnetic radiation
 phir bhi, saturnean model niklaa apane samakalinon kii tulana main kisi bhi aadhunik siddhant ke saath aam main adhik he
 The orbits are named as: "X type" where the x energy level corresponds to the principal quantum number n type is a subset of a lower case shape or orbital and it corresponds to the angular quantum number l, and y That is the number of electrons in the orbital

 The simplest atomic orbitals are those that are computed for systems with an electron, such as a hydrogen atom
 ek electron ke liye neeche ynit kisi bhi anya tatv ke ek parmaanu bahut hydrogen ke samaan he, or kakshaon main ek hi rup le lo
 In the Schrödinger equation for this system of a negative and positive one particle, atomic orbitals are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator for energy
 ve vishleshnatmak praapt kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa arth he ki jiske parinamswaroop kakshaon bahupad shrinkhalaa ke utpaadon, or ghaateey or trikoshmetiya kaary kar rahe hai For atoms with two or more electrons, the governing equation can only be solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation
 bahu electron parmaanuon kii kakshaon main gunatmak hydrogen ke un logon ke liye samaan hai, or saral model main, ve ek hi farm ke liye liya jaataa he
 For more rigorous and accurate analysis, numerical approximations should be used
 ek parmaanu main ek crystalia thos kai variya kulhadiyon kaa maananaa he ambeded he, lekin koi pasandida disha
 Instead of building atomic orbitals outside the product of radial functions and a single spherical harmonic, linear combinations of spherical rhythms are typically used, so that the imaginary part of spherical harmonics cancel out
 ye asli kakshaon imaarat blokon sabase adhik kakshiya drushyavlokan main dikhaaya jaataa he
 In real hydrogen-like orbitals, for example, n and l have the same interpretation and significance as their complex counterparts, but m is no longer a good quantum number
 kakshaon ek manakikrut kartiya aadhaar ke liye sammaan ke saath unke aakaar ke aadhaar par nae naam die gaye hai
 In atoms with an energy of one electron, an orbital is specifically chosen n
 n = 1 kakshiya parmaanu main sambhav sabase kam urja he
 Each successively higher value of n has a higher level of energy, but n increases as the difference decreases
 ucch n ke liye, urja kaa str itnaa adhik he ki electron aasaani se parmaanu se batch sakate ho jaataa he
 In single electron atoms, there are n within all levels with different l degenerate, have the same energy
 
 This approximation is broken to a minor extent by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus and by the quantum electric effect
 uttararddh vishesh rup se electronon ki nabhik najadik janaa he, kyonki ye ek bahut thodaa alag parmaanu prabharee lag rahaa he, yahaan tak ki ek electron parmaanuon main chote bandhan urja matbhedon ko prerit In atoms with many electrons, the energy of an electron depends not only on the intrinsic properties of its orbit, but also on its interaction with other electrons
 in mulakaaton apane sthanik sambhaavna vitaran ke vistaar par nirbhar karti he, or isliye kakshaon kii urja ke str par hi nahin n lekin yah bhi par l nirbhar karte hai
 Favors are associated with higher values of energy; For example, the 2p state is higher than the 2s state

 Kabir or Bhagat Kabir was a 15th century Indian mystic poet and saint
 ve hindi sahitya ke bhaktikalin yug main gyanashrayi-nirgun shakha kii kavyadhara ke pravartak the
 His compositions influenced the Bhakti movement of the Hindi state to a deeper level

 He was a critic of Hinduism and Islam
 unhone saamaajik andhvishwaas kii ninda kii or saamaajik buraaiyon kii sakht aalochana kii thi
 During his lifetime both Hindus and Muslims threatened him for his views
 kabir panth naamak dharmik sampradaay inaki shikshaaon ke anuyaayi hai
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars about the place of birth, but most scholars consider their birth in Kashi only, which also confirms this statement of Kabir himself
 kabir ke guru ke sambandh main prachlit kathan he ki kabir ko upyukt guru kii talash thi
 He wanted to make Vaishnava saint Acharya Ramanand his master but he refused to make Kabir a disciple but Kabir decided in his mind to make Swami Ramananda his master at all costs, for this, a thought in Kabir's mind He came that Swami Ramanand ji goes to bathe in the Ganges at four o'clock in the morning before he will lie down the stairs on his way and he did so
 ek din, ek pahar raat rahete hi kabir panchganga ghat kii sidhiyon par gir pade
 Ramanand ji was descending the stairs to perform Gangesan, when his foot fell on Kabir's body
 unke mukh se tatkaal 'ram-ram' shabd nikal padaa
 Kabir accepted the same Rama as the deeksha-mantra and accepted Ramanand ji as his guru
 kabir ke hi shabdon main- Kabir used to work as a weaver to earn a living
 kabir kii drudh manyata thi ki karmon ke anusaar hi gati milti he sthaan vishesh ke kaaran nahin
 He went to Maghar at the end of time to prove his belief; because people believed that one dies in Kashi and one gets heaven when Maghar dies
 magahar main unhone antim saans lee
 Even today the tomb and mausoleum are located there

 The disciples collected their works in a book titled "bijak" which has three main parts: Sakhi, Sabad, Ramani sadhu santon kaa to ghar main jamaavada rahata hi tha
 Kabir was not educated - 'don't touch my paper, i don't touch a pen
 'unhone swayan granth nahin likhe, munh se bhakhe or unke shishyon ne use likh liya
 The glory of Ramnama is echoed in all your thoughts

 They did not consider avatar, idol, Roza, Eid, Masjid, temple etc
 ve kabhi kehete hai- 'harimor Piu, i am Ram's daughter-in-law', sometimes say, 'hari janani main balak tora'
 or kabhi "bada hua to kya hua jaisai" At that time, the Hindu public was affected by the terror of Muslim terror
 kabir ne apane panth ko is dhang se suniyojit kiya jisase muslim mat kii ore jhuki hui janata sahaj hi inaki anuyaayi ho gayi
 He kept his language simple and comprehensible so that it could reach the common man
 isse donon sampradaayon ke paraspar milan main suvidha hui
 Their creeds were against Muslim culture and cow-feeding
 kabir ko shantimay jivan priy tha or ve ahimsa, satya, sadachaar aadi gunon ke prashansak the
 Today, due to his simplicity, saintly nature and saintly tendency, he is also being respected abroad

 There was a small temple of Ramakrishna
 vahaan ke sant bhagwaan goswami ke jigyaasu sadhak the kintu unke tarkon kaa abhi tak puri tarah samaadhaan nahin hua tha
 He exchanged views with Sant Kabir
 kabir kii ek saakhi ne un ke man par gaharaa asar kiya- 'ban te bhaga bhirahe bhi bhi bhi, moan apni baan karaha bedan kaason kahe, ko karaha ko jaan
 
 ' Who should tell the elephant who has fallen in the pit lost by the fowler while running from the forest? saransh yah ki dharm kii jigyaasa sein prerit ho kar bhagwaan gosai apana ghar chhod kar baahar to nikal aaye or harivyasi sampradaay ke gadde main gir kar akele nirvasit ho kar asanvaadya sthiti main pad chuke hai
 Targeting the idol worship, he made a appearance - paahan puuje hari milain, to main poojon pahaar
 Well, it is good, PC Khay Sansar
 
 Kabir's Rama is unknowable and resides in every particle of the world
 kabir ke ram islam ke akeshwarwadi, eksattavadi khuda bhi nahin hai
 In Islam, Khuda or Allah is believed to be different from entire world and creatures and supremely capable
 par kabir ke ram param samarth bhale hon, lekin samast jeevon or jagat se bhinn to kadaapi nahin hai
 Rather, on the contrary, they are the prevalent Ramta Ram
 vah kehete hainvyapak brahm sabanimain ekai, ko pandit ko jogi
 ravana-rao Kavansun Kavan Veda
 kabir ram kii kisi khaas roopakriti kii kalpana nahin karte, kyonki roopakriti kii kalpana karte hi ram kisi khaas dhaanche main bandh jate, jo kabir ko kisi bhi haalat main manjuur nahin
 Kabir wanted to give a different and broader form to the concept of Ram
 iske kuch vishesh kaaran the, jinaki charchaa ham is lekh main aage karenge
 But despite this, Kabir definitely establishes a personal family type relationship with Ram
 ram ke saath unka prem unki alokik or mahimashali satta ko ek kshan bhi bhulaae bagaiyr sahaj premparak maanviya sambandhon ke dharaatal par pratishthit he
 Kabir believes in the name, not the form
 haalaanki bhakthi-samvednaa ke siddhanton main yah baat saamaanya rup se pratishthit he ki ‘naam rup se badhkar he’, lekin kabir ne is saamaanya siddhant kaa kranthidharmee upyog kiya
 Kabir, with the name Ram, gave a sublime and comprehensive look to the centuries-old synthetic sentiments created in Lokmanya and tried to prevent him from being tied to the mythology-propounded Brahminical ideology
 kabir ke ram nirgun-sagun ke bhed se pare hai
 In fact, he used the word 'nirgun Rama' - 'nirgun Rama Japahu Re Bhai' to separate his Rama from Rastra, the patron of the scripturally-rendered Avatari, Saguna, dominant Varnashrama system
 ’ is ‘nirgun’ shabd ko lekar bhram main padane kii jarurat nahin
 Kabir means just this word that God cannot be bound within the boundaries of any name, form, quality, time etc
 jo sari simaaon se pare hai or phir bhi sarvatra hai, vahi kabir ke nirgun ram hai
 He named it 'ramta Ram'
 apane ram ko nirgun visheshan dene ke baavjood kabir unke saath maanviya prem sambandhon kii tarah ke rishte kii baat karte hai
 Sometimes he considers Rama as his lover or husband, and sometimes he is a lord in the sense of bondage
 kabhi-kabhi vah ram ko vatsalya murti ke rup main maan maan lete hai or khud ko unka putr
 This kind of succulent, spontaneous, human love is unique to Kabir's devotion even with the nirgun-formless Brahm
 yah duvidha or samasya dusron ko bhale ho sakati he ki jis ram ke saath kabir itane anany, maanviya sambandhparak prem karte hon, vah bhala nirgun kaise ho sakate hai, par khud kabir ke liye yah samasya nahin he
 He also says, "santou, tell me cheating
 gunamem nirgun, nirgunamem gun, baat chhandi kyun bahise!”nahin he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain, while expressing his views regarding Kabir's spiritual practice of Ram and Kabir, said: "kabir's entire life was spent in the search for truth and refutation of the truth
 kabir kii sadhana ‘‘maanane se nahin, ‘‘jaanane se armbh hoti he
 He is not a disciple of anyone, but a disciple warned by Ramanand
 unke liye ram rup nahin he, dasharathi ram nahin he, unke ram to naam sadhana ke pratik hai
 His Rama is not imprisoned within the boundaries of any sect, caste or country
 prakruti ke kan-kan main, ang-ang main raman karne par bhi jise anang sparsh nahin kar saktaa, ve alakh, avinashi, param tatv hi ram hai
 His Rama is not a discriminator between man and man
 ve to prem tatv ke pratik hai
 Rising above the sense of love or worship are: ‘prem jagaavai virah ko, virah jagaavai piu, piu jagaavai jeev ko, joi piu soi jiu' - jo piu he, vahi jeev he
 That is why his whole practice is the practice of "hans Ubaran Aaya"
 is hans kaa ubaarana pothiyon ke padhane se nahin ho saktaa, dhai aakhar prem ke aacharan se hi ho saktaa he
 Religion is not a matter of wear and tear, it is a continuous practice of conduct in life
 unki sadhana prem se armbh hoti he
 Love it so deeply that God becomes divine for you
 usko paane kii itani utkantha ho jaae ki sabase vairaygy ho jaae, virah bhav ho jaae tabhi us dhyaan samadhi main piu jaagrath ho saktaa he
 That same Pew can awaken a creature sitting in your heart
 joi piu he soi jiu he
 Then you will love the world, the world will become an object of your love for each organism
 sara ahankaar, sara dwesh dur ho jayega
 Then great spirit will arise

 His mother's name was Anandi Devi and father Munshi Ajayabarya was a postman in Lamhi
 unki shiksha kaa aarambh urdu, farsi se hua or jeevanyaapan kaa adhyaapan se padhane kaa shauk unhen bachapan se hi lag gaya

 All copies of Soje-watan were confiscated and destroyed
 colector ne nawabrai ko hidaayat di ki ab ve kuch bhi nahin likhenge, yadi likhaa to jail bhej diya jayega
 By this time Premchand used to write under the name Dhanpat Rai
 urdu main prakashit hone vaali zamana patrika ke sampadak or unke ajij dost munshi dayanarayan nigam ne unhen premchand naam se likhane kii salaah di

 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala

 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'

 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life
 yah avadh ke kisaan andolanon ke daur main likhaa gaya
 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'
 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi
 Premchand's novels were translated into many languages of India and the world, especially his most popular novel Godan
 inaki adhiktar kahaniyon main nimna va madhyam varg kaa chithran he

 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya

 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill
 premchand ne sahitya ko sachai ke dharaatal par utaara
 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty

 He became a hero in his creations, which Indian society deemed untouchable and disgusting
 unhone saral, sahaj or aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa kaa upyog kiya or apane pragatisheel vichaaron ko dridhtaa se tark dete hue samaaj ke saamne prastut kiya
 Presiding over the first conference of the Progressive Writers Association in 1936, he said that the writer is progressive by nature and he who is not, is not a writer
 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 prem chandra ko log aaj unki kaabiliyat kii vajah se yaad karte hai jo vivaadon ko bahut kam jagah detii he
 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye
 In the era in which Premchand took the pen, there was no solid legacy behind him nor was there any model of thought and progress, except in Bengali literature
 us samay bankim babu the, sharathchandra the or iske alaava tollstoy jaise rusi sahityakar the
 But by the time he composed a classic novel like Godan which is considered a modern classic
 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
 When the freedom movement of India was going on, the expression he gave to both Hindi and Urdu languages through narrative literature gave rise to political stirring, passion and movement to all and made him powerful and this also made his writing powerful
 premchand is arth main nishchit rup se hindi ke pehle pragatisheel lekhak kahe ja sakate hai
 In 1936, he addressed the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Association as the Chairman
 unka yahi bhaashan pragatisheel andolan ke ghoshnaa patr kaa aadhaar bana
 Premchand gave birth to a tradition of storytelling in Hindi and an entire generation followed in his footsteps, Renu, Nagarjuna and after him Srinath Singh has written stories of rural environment in the 50-60s, in a way that tradition of Premchand Comes in line with premchand ek krantikari rachanaakaar the, unhone na keval deshbhakti balki samaaj main vyaapt anek kuritiyon ko dekha or unako kahani ke madhyam se pehali baar logon ke samaksh rakhaa
 He began to portray all the problems of society at that time
 usamen dalit bhi aate hai, nari bhi aati hai
 All these subjects later became major discourses of Hindi literature
 premchand hindi cinema ke sabase adhik lokapriy sahityakaron main se hai
 Satyajit Rai made memorable films on two of his stories
 1977 main shatranj ke khilaadi or 1981 main sadgati
 Two years after his death, Subramaniam made the film in 1938 on the novel Sevasadan in which Subbalakshmi played the lead role
 1977 main mrinal sen ne premchand kii kahani kafan par aadhaarit oka uri katha naam se ek telugu film banaai jisko sarvshereshth telugu film kaa rashtriya puraskaar bhi mila
 Godan in 1963 and embezzlement in 1966 became popular films
 1980 main unke upanyaas par bana tivi dharawahik nirmala bhi bahut lokapriy hua tha
 The credit for distinguished Premchand in Hindi literature and criticism is given to Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma
 unhone premchand par do pramukh kitaaben likhin- 'premchand' or 'premchand or unka yug'
 Amritrai and Madangopal did the work of saving Premchand's letters
 premchand par hue nae adhyayanon main kamalkishor goyanka or dow dharmaveer kaa naam ullekhneey he
 Kamalkishore Goenka has edited 'premchand's Unreachable Literature' and 'premchand Encyclopaedia' along with highlighting the weak sides of Premchand's life
 dow dharmaveer ne dalit drushti se premchand sahitya kaa mulyankan karte hue 'premchand : samant kaa munshi' va 'premchand kii neeli ankhen' naam se pustaken likhi hai
 On July 31, 1980, a postage stamp worth 30 paise was issued by the Indian Postal Service Department in memory of Premchand
 gorakhpur ke jis skool main ve shikshak the, vahaan premchand sahitya santhaan kii sthapana kii gai he

 Premchand's wife Shivrani Devi wrote his biography by name in Premchand's house and has exposed the part of his personality that people were unaware of

 In the medieval period, 'newspapers' started coming out in the trading centers of Europe
 un main kaarobaar, kray-vikray or mudra ke mulya main utaar-chadhaav ke samachar likhe jate the
 But all these 'newsletters' were written by hand

 Aryabhata was a great astrologer and mathematician of ancient India
 inhone aryabhatiy granth kii rachana kii jisamen jyotishshastra ke anek siddhanton kaa pratipaadan he
 In the same book, he has written his birthplace Kusumpur and the birth term Saka Samvat 398
 bihar main vartmaan patna kaa pracheen naam kusumpur tha lekin aryabhat kaa kusumpur dakshin main tha, yah ab lagbhag siddh ho chukaa he
 According to another belief, he was born in the Ashmak country of Maharashtra
 unke vaigyanik kaaryon kaa samaadar rajdhani main hi ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, after a long journey, he completed his compositions in Rajsanidhi, located in Kusumpur near modern Patna
 yadhyapi aryabhat ke janm ke varsh kaa aryabhatiy main spasht ullekh he, unke janm ke vaastavik sthaan ke bare main vivaad he
 Some believe that they were born in the region between Narmada and Godavari, known as Ashmaka and they identify Ashmaka from central India, which includes Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, although the early Buddhist text called Ashmaka to the south , As Dakshinapath or Deccan, while other texts describe that the people of Ashmaka must have fought Alexander, according to Ashmaka should be further to the north

 Aryabhata also mentions King Bharata while defining the Yugas - the fifth verse of the Dasgeetika describes the time passed by the time of King Bharata
 un dinon main kusumpura main ek prasiddh vishvavidhyalay tha jahaan jainon kaa nirnaayak prabhaav tha or aryabhat kaa kaam is prakaar kusumpura pahunch sakaa or use pasand bhi kiya gaya
 However, it is fairly certain that at some point he went to Kusumpura for higher education and also lived there for some time

 He used to live there during the last days of the Gupta Empire

 unhone aryabhatiy naamak mahatvapurn jyotish granth likhaa, jisamen vargamul, ghanmul, samaantar shrenee tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke samikarnon kaa varnan he
 In his treatise called Aryabhatiya, he also represented the mathematician theory in 33 verses which can contain a total of 3 pages, and the astronomical theory in 75 verses in 5 pages and also the instruments for this
 aryabhat ne apane is chote se granth main apane se purvavarti tathaa pashchaadvarti desh ke tathaa videsh ke siddhanton ke liye bhi krantikari avadharanaayen upasthit kin
 His major work, Aryabhatiya, is a collection of mathematics and astronomy, which has been extensively cited in the Indian mathematical literature and is still in existence in modern times
 aryabhatiy ke ganitiya bhaag main ankaganit, bijganit, saral trikonmiti or goleey trikonmiti shaamil hai
 It includes continuous fractions, quadratic equations, sum of power series and a table of sines

 Possibly in the 9th century inscription, it is mentioned by the Persian scholar and Indian historian Abu Rehan al-biruni
 mukhya lekh aryabhatiy Direct details of Aryabhata's work are known only from Aryabhatiya
 aryabhatiy naam baad ke tippaneekaron dwaara diya gaya he, aryabhat ne swayan ise naam nahin diya hoga; yah ullekh unke shishy bhaskar pratham ne ashmakatantr yaa ashmaaka ke lekhon main kiya he
 It is also sometimes known as arya-shata-ashta - the number of verses in his text
 yah sutara sahitya ke samaan bahut hi sankshipt style main likhaa gaya he, jahaan prayek pankti ek jatil pranali ko yaad karne ke liye sahaayta karti he
 Thus, the interpretation of meaning is due to commentators

 Aryabhata has had a great influence on the astrological theory of India and the world
 bharat main sabase adhik prabhaav kerala pradesh kii jyotish parampara par rahaa
 Aryabhata holds the most important position among Indian mathematicians
 inhone 120 aryaalandon main jyotish shaastra ke siddhant or usase sambandhit ganit ko sutararup main apane aryabhatiy granth main likhaa he
 He on the one hand represented the value of pi more accurate and sure than the preceding Archimedes in mathematics, while on the other hand it was declared for the first time in astronomy with the example that the Earth itself rotates on its axis
 aryabhat ne jyotishshastra ke aajkal ke unnat sadhano ke bina jo khoj kii thi,yah unki mahatta he
 Aryabhata had discovered the discovery of Copernicus a thousand years ago
 "golpad" main aryabhat ne likhaa he "naav main baitha hua manushya jab pravaah ke saath aage badhata he, tab vah samajhataa he ki achar vriksh, pashaan, parvat aadi padaarth ulti gati se ja rahe hai
 In the same way, stable constellations also appear to be moving in reverse from the moving earth
 " is prakaar aryabhat ne sarvapratham yah siddh kiya ki prithvi apane aksh par gumti he
 He considered Satyuga, Treta, Dwapara and Kali Yuga as equal
 inke anusaar ek kalp main 14 manwantar or ek manwantar main 72 mahayug tathaa ek chaturyug main satyuga, dwapar, treta or kaliyug ko samaan mana he
 According to Aryabhata the relation of circumference and diameter of a circle comes to 62,832: 20,000 which is pure to four decimal places
 aryabhat ne badi-badi sankhyaon ko aksharon ke samooh se nirupit karne kityant vaigyanik vidhi kaa prayog kiya he
 The place-value numeral system, first seen in the Bakshali manuscript of the third century, was clearly present in his works
 unhone nishchit rup se pratik kaa upyog nahin kiya, parantu francisi ganitagya george iffrah ke matanusaar- rikt gunank ke saath, das kii ghaat ke liye ek sthaan dharak ke rup main shunya kaa gyaan aryabhat ke sthaan-mulya ank pranali main nihit tha
 However, Aryabhata did not use Brahmi numerals; Continuing the Sanskrit tradition dating back to the Vedic period, he used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities as mnemonic
 aryabhat ne pai ke sanniktan par kaary kiya or sambhawatah unhen is baat kaa gyaan ho gaya tha ki pai irreshnal he
 In the second part of Aryabhatiyam, he writes: iske anusaar vyas or paridhi kaa anupaat × 8 + 62000) / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416 he, jo paanch mahatvapurn aankadon tak bilkul sateek he
 Aryabhata, interpreting the word imminent, coming immediately before the preceding word, states that it is not only an approximation, but that the value is incomparable
 yadi yah sahi he, to yah ek atyant parishkrut drushtikon he, kyonki europe main paai kii tarkheenata kaa siddhant lambert dwaara keval 1761 main hi siddh ho paaya tha
 This approximation was mentioned in Muhammad ibn Musa al-khwarizmi's book on algebra after Aryabhatiya's translation into Arabic
 ganitpad 6 main, aryabhat ne trikon ke kshetrafal ko is prakaar bataaya he- This translates to: The area of a triangle is equal to the result of half of the side with a perpendicular
 aryabhat ne apane kaam main dwijya ke vishay main charchaa kii he or usko naam diya he ardh-jya iskaa shabdic arth he "ardh-tantri"
 People started calling it sine because of the ease
 jab arabi lekhakon dwaara unke kaam kaa sanskrit se arabi main anuwaad kiya gaya, to unhone isko jiba kaha 
 Since, in Arabic writing, vowels are used less frequently, hence its more abbreviated name
 jab baad ke lekhakon ko ye samaj main aayaa ki jb jiba kaa hi sankshipt rup he, to unhone vaapis jiba kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 Jiba means "koh" or "trench"
 baad main barahavin sadi main, jab krimona ke gheraardo ne in lekhanon kaa arabi se latin bhashaa main anuwaad kiya, tab unhone arabi jiba kii jagah uske latin samakaksh sinus ko daal diya, jiskaa shabdic arth "khoh" yaa khai" hi he
 And after that in English, the sinus itself became the sign
 pracheen kal se bhartiya ganitagyon kii vishesh ruchi kii ek samasya rahi he un samikarnon ke purnank hal gyaat karnaa jo ax + b = cy swaroop main hoti he, ek vishay jise vartmaan samay main diophentine sameekaran ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Here gives an example from Bhaskara's interpretation on Aryabhatiya: arthath, bataaen n = 8x+ 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 isse n ke liye sabase chota maan 85 nikalataa he
 In general, the diophantine equations were notorious for rigidity
 is tarah ke samikarnon kii vyapak rup se charchaa pracheen vaidic granth sulb sutara main he, jiske adhik pracheen bhaag 800 i

 Aryabhata's method has been called the Kuttaka method for solving such problems
 kuṭṭaka kuttak kaa arth he peesna, arthath chote chote tukdon main todna or is vidhi main choti sankhyaon ke rup main mul khandon ko likhane ke liye ek punaravarti kalanvidhi kaa samavesh tha
 Today this algorithm, according to Bhaskar's interpretation in 621 AD, is the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations, and is often referred to as the Aryabhata algorithm
 diophentine samikarnon kaa istemaal kryptolujee main hota he or aresae sammelan, 2006 ne apana dhyaan kuttak vidhi or sulvasutra ke purv ke kaaryon par kendrit kiya
 In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata has provided interesting results for the classes and ranges of cubes
 or Aryabhata's astronomy system was called the Auric system, his later writings on astronomy, which propose a second model, superficially, have been lost, but they can be partially reconstructed from the discussions in Brahmagupta's Khandakhadyaka
 is
 kuch granthon main ve prithvi ke ghurnan ko akaash kii abhaasi gati kaa kaaran bataate hai
 Aryabhata seemed to believe that the earth revolves around its axis
 yah srilanka ko sandarbhit ek kathan se gyaat hota he, jo taron kii gati kaa prithvi ke ghurnan se utpann aapekshik gati ke rup main varnan karata he
 The next stanza describes the motion of stars and planets as actual motion: lanka yahan bumadhya rekha par ek sandarbh bindu he, jise khagoleey gananaa ke liye madhyahn rekha ke sandarbh main samaan maan ke rup main le liya gaya tha
 Aryabhata has described a seismic model of the solar system, in which the sun and the moon move through the home cycle, orbiting the Earth
 is model main, jo paaya jaataa he pitamahasiddhanth, prayek grahon kii gati do grahchakron dwaara niyantrit he, ek chota mand grahchakr or ek bada sheeghra grahchakr
 The order of the planets according to the distance from Earth is as follows: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Constellation grahon kii sthiti or avadhi kii gananaa samaan rup se gati karte hue binduon se saapeksh ke rup main kii gayi thi, jo budh or shukr ke maamle main, jo prithvi ke chaaron ore ausat surya ke samaan gati se ghoomte hai or mangal, brihaspati or shani ke maamle main, jo raashichakr main prithvi ke chaaron ore apni vishisht gati se gati karte hai
 According to most historians of astronomy, this two-planetary model reflects elements of Greek astronomy prior to Ptolemy
 aryabhat ke model ke ek anya tatv sighroka, surya ke sambandh main buniyadi grahon kii avadhi, ko kuch itihaaskaaron dwaara ek antarnihit surya kendrit model ke chinh ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 He said that the moon and planets shine with the reflected light of the sun
 maujuuda brahmandavigyaan se alag, jisame grahanon kaa kaarak chhadam grah nispand bindu raahu or ketu the, unhone grahanon ko prithvi dwaara daali jane vaali or is par girane vaali chaaya se sambaddh bataaya
 Thus lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters the Earth's shadow and discusses in detail the size and extent of this Earth's shadow and then the size of the eclipse part during the eclipse and its calculation
 baad ke bhartiya khagolavidon ne in gananaaon main sudhaar kiya, lekin aryabhat kii vidhiyon ne pramukh saar pradaan kiya tha
 The calculation was so accurate that the 18th-century scientist Guillaume le Gentil, during his visit to Pondicherry, found that the period of lunar eclipse of 1765-08-30 by Indians was calculated to be 41 seconds shorter, while its charts were 68 seconds

 This approximation was a significant improvement over the computation of the Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes, 200 AD), whose calculations are not known in modern units, but his estimate had an error of about 5–10%

 Similarly, according to them, the duration of the year of the Earth is 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds, according to the calculation of modern time there is an error of 3 minutes 20 seconds

 Aryabhata claimed that the Earth rotates on its own axis and that some elements of their planetary planetary models rotate at the same speed with which the planets revolve around the Sun
 is prakaar aisa suzav diya jaataa he ki aryabhat kii sangannaayen anternihit surya kendrit model par aadhaarit thim, jisame grah surya kaa chakkar lagaate hai

 haalaanki kuch log yah sweekaar karte hai ki aryabhat kii pranali purv ke ek surya kendrit model se upji thi jiskaa gyaan unako nahin tha
 It has also been claimed that they considered the planets to be elliptical, although no primary evidence has been presented for this

 Aryabhata's work had a major influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and through translation he influenced many neighboring cultures
 islamic swarna yug, ke dauraan iskaa arabi anuwaad vishesh prabhaavshaalee tha
 Some of his results are cited by al-khwarizmi and referenced by 10th-century Arabic scholar al-biruni, who wrote in his description that Aryabhata's followers believed that the earth rotated on its axis
 sin, kosine ke saath hi, varsin kii unki paribhaasha,or vilom sin, ne trikonmiti kii utpatti ko prabhavit kiya
 He was also the first person to construct sine and versatile tables, from 0 ° to 90 ° at 3
75 ° intervals, to a precision of 4 decimal places
 vastav main "sin " or "kosine " ke aadhunik naam aryabhat dwaara prachlit jya or kojya shabdon ke galat uccharan hai
 He was pronounced in Arabic as Jiba and Kojiba

 Aryabhata's methods of astronomical calculation were also very influential
 trikonmitik talikaon ke saath, ve islamic duniya main vyapak rup se istemaal kii jaati thi
 And many Arabic astronomical tables were used to calculate
 vishesh rup se, arabi spain vaigyanik al-jharkaali ke kaaryon main pai jane vaali khagoleey talikaon kaa latin main tolado kii talikaon ke rup main anuwaad kiya gaya or ye europe main sadiyon tak sarvaadhik sookshm panchang ke rup main istemaal main rahi
 The date calculations done by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for practical purposes of determining the Panchang or Hindu calendar, which was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar, which Omar Khayyam in 1073 Including some astronomers, the version of which is presented as a national calendar in Iran and Afghanistan today
