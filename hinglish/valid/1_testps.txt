abhigyaan shaakuntalan kaa naam sabase upar he
 His fourth verse in Abhigyan Shakuntalam and fourth verse in this issue is very delightful
 abhigyaan shaakuntal main naatakeeyata ke saath-saath kavy kaa ansh bhi yathesht maatra main he
 Shringar is the main juice in it; And its coincidence and disconnection have matured beautifully on both sides
 iske atirikt hasya, vir tathaa karun ras kii bhi jahaan-tahaan acchhee abhivyakti hui he
 Beautiful and enchanting expectations from place to place not only amazes the reader, but also helps in increasing the intensity of the desired emotion
 saare naatak main kalidas ne apni upamaaon or utprekshaon kaa upyog kahin bhi keval alankaar-pradarshan ke liye nahin kiya
 Their simile or catalysis at each place has helped in making the expression of meaning juicy
 kalidas apni upamaaon ke liye sanskrit-sahitya main prasiddh hai
 In Shakuntal too, his power to choose the appropriate simile was well known
 shakuntala ke vishay main ek jagah raja dushyant kehete hai ki ‘vah aisa phool he, jise kisi ne suungha nahin he; aisa navpallav he, jis par kisi ke nakhon kii kharonch nahin lagi; aisa ratna he, jisamen chhed nahin kiya gaya or aisa madhu he, jiskaa swaad kisi ne chakhaa nahin he
 'through these similes, a unique glimpse of Shakuntala's beauty comes before our eyes
 isi prakaar paanchaven ank main dushyant shakuntala kaa parityag karte hue kehete hai ki ‘he tapaswini, kya tum vaise hi apane kul ko kalankit karnaa or mujhe patit karnaa chaahati ho, jaise tat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi tat ke vriksh ko to giraati hi he or apane jal ko bhi malin kar leti he
 'upma, given here by the river flowing through the river of Shakuntala, is particularly helpful in expressing the king's mood
 isi prakaar jab kanv ke shishy shakuntala ko saath lekar dushyant ke paas pahunchate hai to dushyant kii drushti un tapasviyon ke bich main shakuntala ke upar jaakar padati he
 By not giving a detailed description of Shakuntala's beauty there, the poet has only said to her mouth that 'who is that veiled beauty among these ascetics, which looks like a new spring in the midst of yellow leaves
 ’ is choti-si upama ne pile pattey or konpal kii sadrishyata ke dwaara shakuntala ke soundarya kaa puraa hi chitrankan kar diya he
 Similarly, looking at Sarvadamana, Dushyant says that 'this majestic child appears like the fire that is burning, looking for fuel to become a blazing fire
 ’ is upama se kalidas ne na keval balak kii tejaswita prakat kar di, balki yah bhi spasht rup se suchit kar diya he ki yah balak bada hokar mahapratapi chakravarti samraat banegaa
 Many examples of such delightful similes can be given from Shakuntal because 180 similes have been used in Shakuntal
 or unamem se sabhi ek se ek badhkar hai
 It is fine that Kalidas had special skill in the choice of Upma and it is also true that some of his beautiful analogies are rare in the compositions of other poets, yet Kalidasa's biggest feature is not upma-kaushal
 upama-kaushal to unke kavy-kaushal kaa ek saamaanya-sa ang he
 Kalidas knows many methods to express his mood or to perfect a rasa or to awaken the intense feeling of an emotion
 shabdon kaa prasangochit chayan, abhisht bhav ke upyukt chand kaa chunaav or vyanjana-shakti kaa prayog karke kalidas ne apni style ko vishesh rup se romantic bana diya he
 Where Kalidas has descended on Shakuntala's aesthetic narrative, he has not satisfied by merely drawing the form of Shakuntala by similes and incantations
 pehle-pehle to unhone keval itnaa kahalwaya ki ‘yadi tapovana ke nivaasiyon main itnaa rup he, to samajho ki van-lataaon ne udyaan kii lataaon ko maat kar diya
 Then he told Dushyant's face that 'it is like to plant such a beautiful girl in the rules of the ashram, like cutting the acacia tree from the petals of Neel Kamal
 ’ uske baad kalidas kehete hai ki ‘shakuntala kaa rup aisa manohar he ki bhale hi usne motaa valkal vastra pahana hua he, phir usase bhi uskaa saundarya kuch gata nahin, balki badha hi he
 Because whatever is given to a beautiful person becomes his ornament
 ’ uske baad raja shakuntala kii sukumaar deh kii tulana hari-bhari phulon se ladi lata ke saath karte hai, jisase us vilakshan saudarya kaa swaroop pathak kii ankhon ke saamne chitrit-sa ho uthta he
 After this, Kalidasa has brought a bhramar to bring that beauty to the climax; Who considers the face of Shakuntala as a beautiful blossoming flower and hovers over it to make it juicy
 is prakaar kalidas ne shakuntala ke saundarya ko chitrit karne ke liye anlakaaron kaa sahaara utana nahin liya, jitna ki vyanjanashkti kaa; or yah vyajana-shakti hi kavy kii jaan maani jaati he

 har ek jivi, jisko saas lenaa aata he, use kuch na kuch to mahasoos hota hai
 This is not only for empty humans, but for every GV
 is mahasoos ko ham english main imotional naam ke dwaara jaanate he
 Emotional levels are seen differently from one organism to another
 is tarah hum fcologi ke dwaara is imotional lewel yaa balance ko pramanit kar sakate he or use bahut achche se nibhaa bhi sakate hai
 We should never insult the emotion of any other person
 ham har samay kuch na kuch to mehsoos karte hai
 We also call it sentiment
 vah bhaavana samay, duusare logon or apane man ke anusaar badalta rahata hai
 We keep expressing this feeling through our face
 hamaari aakhon main vah bhavnaae prakat hoti rahati hai
 But if a person wants, he can stop this feeling from seeing another person
 iske liye thode drid sankalp kii zarurat hoti he
 But more and more people cannot stop these feelings and show their feelings to others even if they want to or not
 maanav jivi baat ke prati ek duusare se bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karte hai
 By their language style, use of body, movement of eyes and ways of speaking, we can consider their mind
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki hum jo bhi man main aaye hum vah such sakate he duusare insaan ke bare main, par iske dwara ham khali andaaza kar sakate he ki duusare maanav yaa jivi ke man main kya chhalra hai
 We human beings can know the mood of others by looking at each other's eyes and faces
 is pakaar se ham baad main us vyakti se baat chit karte hai
 If he is a flower with Adam or Auraath Khushi, then we also participate in that happiness and if he is sad for Adam or Auraath, then we are trying to fix his mood
 is prakaar ek susare ke bhavanaavon ke bal par ek dusron ko samaj sakate hai
 In the same way, there are many emotions in the mind
 jaise kii shrungar { jaha ek duusare kaa paar karata hai }, rodhra { gussa dikhaanaa }, haasya { has mukh }, bibats { asah karnaa }, vir { virtv }, bhayanak { dar jaan }, adbut { chakit konaa }, karuna { dayaa karnaa }, sahaj { samaa bhaavana } yah hamaraa shaaston main likhaa gaya nav ras hai
 Whatever we show in the faces, all of them are one of these new feelings
 is prakaar ek maanav duusare maanav se in bhavanon ke dwara bhashan kar dete he
 Humans are fine, but what about those who cannot talk? a creature and a human being? Between two animals, we can also overcome this question
 yah jaruri nahi ki baat ke dwara hi ham ek duusare se bhaavana prasut karte hai
 The last is enough
 jisase hum ek duusare ko pahchaan kar sakate hai
 Similarly, there is no need to speak between a dog and a human
 par aakhon ke ishaaron se hi sab baat prakat kiya jaataa hai
 We can put this thing not just to some wells, but also to trees, plants and other animals
 is prakaar hum hameshaa ek duusare ko zyada samajhane kii, ek dusre kii bhalaai karenge or mil-julkar rahane kii koshish karte he
 Similarly, we should understand and understand each other's feelings
 dusron ko galat naa samaj ke unki bhaawanaaon ko mahatv dete hue agar ham sabakaa bhaawanaaon ko ek samaan rakhte he to hamaari jindagi aasaan ho jaati hai
 You can also understand each other better and nature will also maintain a good relationship between animals and humans

 In ancient times, agriculture was cultivated in harmony with the natural environment of human health, so that the cycle of exchange between organic and inorganic materials continued, which did not pollute water, land, air and environment
 bharat varsh main pracheen kaal se krishi ke saath-saath gau paalan kiya jaataa tha, jiske pramaan hamaare granthon main prabhu krishna or balram hai jinhen ham gopal evam haldhar ke naam se sambodhit karte hai arthath krishi evam gopaalan sanyukt rup se atyaadhik laabhadaayi tha, joki praani maatr va vaataavaran ke liye atyant upyogi tha

 Therefore, in order to deal with all the above problems of this kind, it has been recommended to cultivate the principle of sustainable farming continuously over the years, which was encouraged by the State Agriculture Department to adopt this particular type of farming, which we have been promoting for organic farming

 This dimension of individualism brings him closer to anarchist results
 lekin, vyaktvaad kaa dilachasp pahalu yah he ki aadhunik samay main iske zariye samaaj-vigyaan main saamaajik kalyaan or rajya ke hastkshep kii dharanaon ko bhi pusht kiya gaya he
 Individualist formulations have been used by leftists as well as rightists

 Individualists who insist on limiting the role of the state favor free market based capitalism

 John Stuart Mill formulated the principle of individualism in his work On Liberty
 unhone mukt vyapaar kii vakaalat adam smith kii tarah bhautik kushahaali kii khaatir na karke vyaktigat str par aatm-vikaas kii khaatir kii
 In this famous work on freedom, Mill introduced Jeremy Bentham's ideas in a more sophisticated way
 unhone tark diya ki kisi vyakti ke mat kaa samaaj yaa rajya ke samuhik nirnay ke aadhaar par daman nahin kiya ja saktaa
 They advocate to protect personal liberty and see happiness as a protection of individuality, going beyond Bentham
 unke yahan vaiyaktikta manushya kii iyatta ke vikaas kii purvashart he
 Progress will only happen when the individual will be useful to society apart from others in their individuality
 mil swadhinata ke teen aayam bataate hai : vichaar or bahes kii swatantraaa, vaiyaktikta kaa siddhant or vyakti kii kriyaaon par rajya or samaaj ke niyantran kii seemaa
 It is evident that this second stream of individualist thinking expands this principle from the limits of personal greed and extends it to personal self-development
 ahanvaadi vyaktvaad in vyakhyaaon ke tahat vaikasik vyaktvaad kaa rup le letaa he
 For this reason, some socialist thinkers have also adopted individualism
 unke anusaar agar manushya swaabhaavik rup se saamaajik praani he to vyaktvaad kaa taatpary swa-hit tak simit na rah kar birdaraana sahyog or saamudayik jivan se judaa hona chahie
 In the nineteenth century, French socialist Jean Jourez called socialism to the logical end of individualism

 Redefining individualism, he has seen an autonomous person as an active figure in an atmosphere of mutual dependence and reciprocity
 semual smiles ne 1859 main 'self-help' naamak kitaab likhi thi, jise vyaktvaad kii bible samajha jaataa he
 Smiles lauded the Victorian qualities of enterprise, concentration and sustainability, calling 'self-help' without any outside help the basis for a person's true development

 In this way Spencer tried to provide a biological basis to individualism

 The new rightists attacked the philanthropic state as a 'culture of dependency'

 Individualism is not only important as a normative principle, but it also has a methodological form
 iske tahat vyakti ke purv-sthapit model ke aadhaar par maan liya jaataa he ki uski aavashyaktaayen, kamanaayen or chaalak-tatva kya-kya ho sakate hai
 On the basis of this 'prescribed' and 'given' human nature, the principles of social settlement were formulated in the seventeenth century and in the twentieth century political science it was used to formulate the concept of intelligent selection
 vyaktvaad kii paddati ke mutabik hi clasical or nioclasical arthshaastra ke siddhanton kaa sutrikaran hua
 The biggest problem of methodological individualism is that it is non-social and non-historical
 maanviya prakruti samaaj-dar-samaaj badalati rahati he
 It cannot have any universally prescribed or paid form
 samudaay kaa prashn aate hi vyaktvaad ko aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Individualism has been criticized from time to time by socialist, communist, conservative, nationalist and most fascist thinkers
 in aalochanaon ke centre main mukhyatah do prashn hai : kya vyakti ko samudaay se swatantra or aatm- nirbhar hona chahie? kya aisa karne se saamaajik ekta asambhav nahin ho jaaegi or vyakti algaav va asuraksha kaa shikaar nahin ho jayega? The problem of individualism in Western philosophy first arose during the time of sophist thinkers, around the fifth century BCE
 mulat: yah saamaajik samasya thi
 The early regimes were founded on the valor of the warriors
 kalantar main, un praarambhik shaskaon ke vanshaj, parivaar tathaa unke sambandhiyon ke kul kuleen ban gaye the
 The warriors were his helpers and retainers
 sophist kaal ke unani samaaj main kulinon or yoddhaon kii hi ginati thi
 These were the facilities available to them
 kuleen samaaj paramparaon ko daivi bataakar saamaanya janon ke adhikaron kaa apharan kar rahaa tha
 In such circumstances, the Sophists tried to prove the traditions to be honorable
 sophiston main vayovruddh protagoras ne manushya ko sabhi vastuon kaa maandand ghoshit kiya
 The above statement of Protagoras is famous as the original source of individualism in the history of Western philosophy
 isi pratigya ke anuroop protagoras ne gyaan kii vyakhya main kaha, "ham vastuon ko nahin, pratyaksh ke vishyo ko jaanate hai
 Mentioning the common direct as the source of knowledge was the endorsement of the power and the value of the ordinary person on mental grounds
 " yah "alp" kii saidhantik satta ke viruddh saamanyat: gyaat "bahu" kii satta kaa samarthan tha
 But the dispute did not end
 aflatoon ne satta kii samasya par vichaar karte hue vastuon ke "saar" ko satta sweekaar kiya
 He called it a matter
 par vah "saar" vastuon ke virgon main vyas "saamaanya" tha
 In this way, he tried to show specific things to be inaccurate and to show their generalities as real
 aflatoon pratyaksh kii bahuta ko, uske saar kii pruthak satta maanakar, nissar evam asaty siddh karnaa chahta tha
 Aristotle did not immediately make any specific changes to the generalist philosophy of Aflatun, but he emphasized that "matter" and "shape" are the two contributory causes of the object
 inhen vastu se alag nahin kiya ja sakat
 That sounds fine
 vastuen keval sarabhoot gun to nahin ho saktin; keval saar samgr vastu kaa sthanapann kaise ho saktaa he, Following the philosophy of Aflatun and Aristotle, the Cynic and Stoic philosophers emphasized the power of the material object and supported the freedom of the individual on moral grounds
 chhathi shatabdi main bithius ne, arestu kii "kaitagoriya" naamak pustak kaa porphiri krit parichay anudit kar, namawaad kaa maarg prashast kiya
 In the medieval period of Western philosophy, from the 11th to the 14th century, nominalist thinkers equated that the common suffix is nothing but the name, the real power is that of things
 is prasang main wiliam ov okhm kaa samaran kiya ja saktaa he
 He clearly said that only specific things are there
 inhen kii hamen aparokshanubhuti hoti he, jise ham nirnay ke madhyam se vyakt karte hai
 We create common suffixes, excluding the ordinary religions of objects

 They were not ready to place everything in the nutritious world of tradition

 Natural sciences also continued to develop

 Kant, himself a scholar of science, accepted the power of things
 usne jagat kii bhramaatmakataa ko kaayam rakhaa, kintu gyaan kii prakriya ko iske liye uttaradaayi tehraaya
 Now the problem of supporting the object world was over; The problem was to know it

 Against the suffragette Advaita, he established a multiplicity of concrete things
 usne kaha, yadi manushya sahit prayek vastu maatr praathmik niraakaar yaa aseem dravya kaa parinaam he, to naitik uttardaayitv, karm sabandhi swatantraaa, vyaktigat prayatnon or aakankshaon kaa arth kya hoga? It is from here that the plurality of the direct world, including humans, was freed from the philosophical speculation of philosophers
 manovigyaan ne pratyaksh kaa adhyayan kar uchit pratyaksh or bhram ke aadhaaron ko alag kiya
 Realistic thinking was pervaded by the influence of psychology
 manushya or jagat kii satta par andeh karne kii koi baat na rah gai or pratyaksh donon ke bich preshniyata kaa madhyam samajha jane laga
 In the 20th century, philosophical epistemology and psychological interpretations led to a compromise between philosophers emphasizing non-objection or undisclosed direct
 manovigyaan ne vyaktitv ke adhyayan se prayek vyakti ko ek swatantra prakaar nishchit kiya
 The French thinker Henri Vergans gave more value to the inner experience than to the mental perception of things
 vyakti kii aparokshanubhuti use anya vyaktiyon se vishisht bana detii he
 This feeling is not in any specific person, but in everyone
 abhipraay yah he ki ek hi sansar main rahete hue, sabake drushtikon bhinn hai, sabhi apane apane dhang ke vyakti hai
 In this way, the present knowledgemaking confers a specific place to each person in the society
 vartmaan astitvvaad isse bhi thodaa aage badhkar vishisht manasthitiyon evam vaasanaon kaa udghaatan karne main pravrutt he
 If we give place to these individual human trades in the business, we certainly accept the existence and value of all individuals equally

 Although Alauddin accepted the title of 'yamin-ul-khilafat-nasiri-amir-ul-mominin' in recognition of the authority of the Caliphate, he did not think it necessary to take his post from the Caliph
 ulema varg ko bhi apane shashan kaary main hastkshep nahin karne diya
 He considered the interest of the state as paramount, not giving prominence to the principles of the religion of Islam in governance
 allaudin kilji ke samay nirankushta apane charam seemaa par pahunch gayi

 The third rebellion was fought by Alauddin's sister's sons Malik Omar and Mangu Khan, but both of them were defeated and killed
 chauthaa vidroh dilli ke haji maula dwaara kiya gaya, jiskaa daman sarkaar hamiddin ne kiya
 Thus all these rebellions were successfully suppressed
 allaudin ne turk amiron dwaara kiye jane vaale vidroh ke kaarnon kaa adhyayan kar un kaarnon ko samaapt karne ke liye 4 adhyadesh jari kiye
 Under the first ordinance, Alauddin confiscated the land given to the rich in the form of donations, gifts and pensions and imposed a right of tax on him, due to which he lacked funds

 Ranthambore ruler Hammir Dev was famous for his ability and courage
 allaudin ke liye ranthambhore ko jeetna isliye bhi aavashyak tha, kyonki hammirdev ne vidrohi mongol netaa mohammad shah evam kehab ko apane yahan sharan de rakhi thi, isliye bhi allaudin ranthambhore ko jeetna chahta tha
 Hence, in July 1301 AD, Alauddin took the fortress of Ranthambore into his possession
 hammirdev veergati ko praapt hue
 Alauddin killed Ranmal and his companions, who met Hammirdev by betraying him
 ‘tarikh-e-alaai’ evam ‘hammir mahakavy’ main hammirdev or unke parivaar ke logon kaa johar dwaara mrityu praapt hone kaa varnan he

 The ruler of Mewar was Rana Ratan Singh, whose capital was Chittor
 chittod kaa qila samrik drushtikon se bahut surakshit sthaan par bana hua tha
 Therefore this fort was in the eyes of Alauddin
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne amir khusarav ke rani shiba or suleman ke prem prasang ke ullekh aadhaar par or 'padmavat kii katha' ke aadhaar par chittod par na ke akraman kaa kaaran rani padmini ke anupan soundarya ke prati uske aakarshan ko tehraaya he 
 Finally, on 28 January 1303 AD, the Sultan succeeded in taking over the fort of Chittor
 rawal ratan singh yuddh main shahid huye or unki patni rani padmini ne anya striyon ke saath johar kar liya,ye charchaa kaa vishay he

 At the death of friend Muhammad Khan, at first it seemed that all Sher Ali Khan agreed to the throne
 lekin kuch hi der main afzal khan ne afghanistan ke uttari bhaag main sher ali khan ke viruddh baghaavat shuru kar di
 It was seen in these skirmishes that Afzal Khan did not have any thing to show might in the war, but his son Abdur Rahman Khan showed great courage in the fight
 kuch der main donon bhai, afzal khan or sher ali khan, main samjhauta ho gaya
 But by then Amir Sher Ali Khan had been knocked out by Abdur Rahman Khan's jurit and he began to see him as a threat
 sher ali khan ne abdur rahamaan khan ko apane darbar main turant haazir hone kaa farmaan diya, lekin abdur rahamaan khan ne amir ke iraade bhaanp liye
 He crossed the Amu Darya and fled to Bukhara from Kabul

 unhone tashkand main based abdur rahamaan khan par jor daalaa ke vah aamu dariyaa paar karke angrezon ke saath kabul ke takht ke liye jujhe
 march 1880 ko dilli khabar pahunchi ke abdur rahamaan khan uttari afghanistan pahunch gaya he
 After thinking, the British decided that instead of fighting, they should make friends and invite them to become rich in Kabul

 See: antidote yah punjab ke jilon kii suchi he:- Saturn's half-and-half, according to Indian astrology, one of the planets of the Navagrahas, is a kind of planetary condition of Saturn lasting seven and a half years
 jyotish evam khagolashastra ke niyamanusaar sabhi grah ek raashi se duusari raashi main bhraman karte rahete hai
 In this way, when Saturn enters the twelfth zodiac from the lagna, it passes its time in the next two zodiac signs and finishes its cycle
 shani kii manthar gati se chalane ke kaaran ye grah ek raashi main lagbhag dhai varsh yatra karata he, is prakaar ek vartmaan ke pehle ek pichley tathaa ek agle grah par prabhaav daalate hue ye teen guna, arthath saadhe saat varsh kii avadhi kaa kaal saadhe saat varsh kaa hota he
 In Indian astrology, it is known as 1⁄2 and a half
 saadhe saati ke armbh hone ke bare main kai manyataayen hai
 According to an ancient belief, the day when Saturn is in a particular zodiac sign, Saturn's half-century starts
 ek anya manyata yah bhi he ki shani janm raashi ke baad jis bhi raashi main pravesh karata he, saadhe saati kii dasha armbh ho jaati he or jab shani janm se duusare sthaan ko paar kar jaataa he tab isaki dasha se mukti mil jaati he
 Astrologists assess a mathematical method regarding the beginning and end of Saturn , which requires explicit portions of the moon to estimate the time of the start and end of Sati 
 chandramaa ko is vidhi main kendra maan liya jaataa he
 Thus, if Saturn emerges from the three zodiac signs in the period of one and a half years, then the total time of the degrees of the three zodiac signs is divided into two parts
 is prakriya main chandra se donon taraf ek-ek ansh kii duuri banati he
 When Saturn reaches the starting point of this fraction, it is considered the beginning of the seven and a half years and when the last part is crossed it is considered to be the end
 jyotish shaastra ke anusaar alag alag raashiyon ke vyaktiyon main iskaa prabhaav bhi alag alag hota he
 Some people get its signs shortly before the start of the half-century and get rid of its effects before the end of the period, while some people see the effect of Saturn late and the half-century ends
 After some time, its effects cease
 unke anusaar saadhe saati ke sandarbh main kundalee main janm chandra se dwadash sthaan kaa vishesh mahatv he
 The importance of this place is more because the Dwadash place is near the moon sign
 jyotish main dwadash sthaan se kaal purush ke pairon kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he to duusari ore buddhi par bhi iskaa prabhaav hota he
 According to astrologers, there are certain types of events that indicate the onset of seven and a half years
 is dauraan asaamaanya ghataanaon se abhas ho saktaa he ki avadhi chaalu he
 Jyotishacharya suggests several ways to avoid its effects: kehete hai ki shiv kii upasna karne waalon ko isse raahat milti he
 Hence, worship and worship of Shivling should be done regularly
 pipal vriksh shiv kaa rup mana jaataa he, vaise isamen sabhi devataaon kaa nivas maanate hai, atah pipal ko arghr dene se shani dev prasann hote hai
 Anuradha nakshatra should have amavasya and Saturday is the day, worshiping the peepal tree along with oil, sesame and law is liberating
 shanidev kii prasannataa hetu shani stotra kaa niyamit paath karnaa chahie
 Apart from this, Hanuman ji is also considered as Rudravatar
 atah unki aradhana bhi iske nivaaran hetu faldaayi hoti he
 According to the belief, the nail under the boat and the black horseshoe are also worthwhile measures in it
 inaki anguthi banavaakar dhaaran kar sakate hai
 Donating items related to Saturn, such as utensils made of iron, black cloth, mustard oil, leather shoes, black antimony, black gram, black sesame, whole pulse of urad, etc
 on Saturday and black clothes and black items Saturn gets happiness by using it
 iske alaava anya upaay bhi bataaye jate hai
 To avoid the condition of Shani, it is possible to get liberation even if you do the consecration of Shiva by a great priest with the mantra of Mahamrityunjaya
 shani kii dhaiya or saadhe saati ko praayah ashubh evam hanikaarak hi mana jaataa he
 According to learned astrologers, Saturn is not troublesome for everyone
 shani kii dasha main bahut se logon ko apeksha se badhkar laabh, sammaan va vaibhav kii prapti hoti he
 However, some people have to face a lot of trouble and suffering in the condition of Saturn
 is prakaar shani keval ksht hi nahin dete balki shubh or laabh bhi pradaan karte hai
 During this period, if the moon is in a higher zodiac, then more endurance comes and the efficiency increases, while the weak and low moon reduces the tolerance and the mind does not work
 isse samasyaayein or bad jaati hai
 Besides assessing the position of the moon in the horoscope, it is also necessary to assess the position of Saturn
 agar lagn,vrish,mithun,kanya,tula,makar athwa kumbh he to shani haani nahin pahunchaate hai varan unase laabh va sahyog miltaa he shani yadi lagn kundalee va chandra kundalee donon main shubh kaarak he to kisi bhi tarah shani kshtakaari nahin hota he
 If the situation in the horoscope is the opposite, then at the time of 1⁄21⁄2, a lot of problems and difficulties one after the other are encountered
 yadi chandra raashi evam lagn kundalee uparokt donon prakaar se mail nahin khate hon arthath ek main shubh hon or duusare main ashubh to saadhe saati ke samay mila-jula prabhaav miltaa he

 jin kaarnon se sharir ke vibhinn angon kii samyavastha, yaa swastheavastha, nasht hokar unamem vikrutiyaan utpann hoti hai, unako hetukikaarak or unke shaastra ko hetuvigyaan kehete hai
 These reasons are many
 inhen nimnlikhit bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he : The pathogen causing these pathologies is called pathogenesis
 rogakaarak hetuon se sharir ke vibhinn angon main jo aswasth avasthaaen yaa sthityantar utpann hote hai, unako vikrutiyaan kehete hai tathaa in vikrutiyon se yukt dhaatu ang yaa aashay ke vivaran ko vikrut sharir tathaa in vikrutiyon ke shaastra ko vikruti vigyaan yaa pathalogy kehete hai
 The main purpose of pathology is to show the working sense of the various pathologies that occur in different organs from different pathogens
 un vikrutiyon ke sthool or sookshm swaroopon kaa vivaran dena or unke aadhaar par vividh vyaadhiyon se utpann honevaale lakshanon kaa spashtikaran dena hi vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 This objective cannot be proved without combining the complete history of dead persons with various diseases, post-mortem examination, of the deformities found within the various organs of their body
 16 veen - 17 veen shatabdi main paashchaatya deshon main vikruti vigyaan ke liye shavpareekshan kaa prarambh kiya gaya

 It was only after this that pathology gained independent existence
 rudolf phikhon ne 19veen shatabdi main sharirgat vikrutiyon ke pareekshan main sookshmdarshi yantra kaa upyog aarambh kiya or koshikeey vikrutivigyaan par apana granth 1846 i
 main prakashit kiya
 This treatise revolutionized the imagination of the relation between the nature of diseases and which tools should be used for their practice and pathology, which was earlier a small subject under Roganidan, Made a great foundation for diagnosis
 sharir ke angon main honevaali vikrutiyaan avyakt hote hue bhi pratikriya, sujan, jirnoddhar, vruddhi main baadha, apjanan, arbud ityadi kuch ini-gini saamaanya prakaar kii hoti he
 When the nature of these deformations is easily perceptible within the body, then it is called macro deformity and when there is a deformity of the subtle form, when the microscope instrument is needed to see these deformations then it is called micro deformation
 vikrutiyon main sharir ke vibhinn angon kii vaishamyavastha par tathaa unke rachanaatmak or swarupatmak parivartanon par jor diya jaataa he or rogon main unke kaaryaatmak parivartanon par jor diya jaataa he
 In the summary, malformations are related to different organs and the disease is mostly related to symptoms
 sharir main vikrutiyon ke swaroop main rog bahut pehle se rahata he
 Only by being very subtle does the sensory intelligence become less and more intelligent
 jab sharirgat sampurna vikrutiyon kaa tathaa unke hetuon kaa varnan uparyukt sarsaadhaaran prakaaron ke anusaar kiya jaataa he, to usko saamaanya vikrutivigyaan kehete hai or jab sharir ke prayek ang, aashay yaa santhaan kaa varnan usamen honevaali uparyukt prakaar kii vikrutiyon ke saath swatantra rup se kiya jaataa he, tab usko vishesh vikrutivigyaan kehete hai
 The patient's pathology is studied by clinical pathology from various examinations inside the laboratory
 saamaanya vikrutivigyaan ko nimnlikhit adhyyon main baanta gaya he
 Modern thinkers believe that inflammation is simply a reaction made by living body cells against any irritation
 kshobh ke chaar kaaran maane gaye hai : The following are the major signs of inflammation: iske saath hi saath utakon main kuch aghat hone se tathaa kuch shul ke kaarnon se ang kii kriyashakti kaa bhi hraas hota he
 The loss, destruction and damage of various tissues that make up the body is called normal tissue
 kaaran - oothkakshay ke nimna kaaran pramukh hai : In summary, the main cause of adipose tissue is the blockage of arteries, veins and capillaries
 iske kaaran ukt sthaan par paushtik padaarth nahin pahunchataa he
 The following are the types of tissue: yah bhi ootkavishesh par honevaali kriya he
 When a tissue is called degeneration, it must be understood to mean a particular type of change in the tissue, such as saying fat degeneration is the presence of fat in a particular tissue, such is the perception, naming accordingly, such as the heart Deterioration, muscular degeneration, mechanical degeneration etc
 duusare shabd main utakon ke paushtik aahaar kii kami se koshika kii rasinic kriya main jab parivartan aa jaataa he, to use apakarshan kehete hai
 In this, the cell dies completely and a new type of chemical substance is produced from its protoplasm
 yah padaarth koshika kii rachana se pichhali purnataya bhinn hota he or isse koshika kaa kaary bilkul bhinn ho jaataa he
 When a specific substance comes out of the lymph inside the cell, it is called inhalation
 yah ant:spandan mukhyat: vasiy, chooneydaar varna kii tathaa amiloid prakaar ko hota he, jab ki apakarsh vasiy mucaide tathaa coloid hota he
 When there is a type of rot in the tissue due to lack of blood, it is called koth
 yah do prakaar kaa hota he shushk koth tathaa ardra 
 Dry koth - When the blood reaches an organ through an artery of one part, dry koth is produced
 ardra kosh - isamen shiraaon dwaara ang vishesh se rakt kaa hriday kii ore dhoya janaa purnataya ruk jaataa he
 There is a flow of blood at that place, but there is no drain
 uparyukt do prakaar ke koth ke atirikt or prakaar ke bhi koth hote hai, jaise, ant: shaalyik koth, sankrami koth, vaatikoth, madhumeh janit koth, vardhaky koth tathaa renon kaa rog 
 The action of chronic or destroyed tissue or cells is regained as much as possible, with the intention that their regeneration is called reconstruction, or renovation
 yah sharir kii aisi vishisht avasthaa he, jisamen shaareerik utak kii navvruddhi hoti he
 Generally, tumors are of two types: mridu arbud - ye praghatak isiilie kahe jate hai ki inke dwaara jivan ko kisi prakaar kii kshati nahin pahunchati
 Malignant tumors - In those tumors where disruption is excessive, the shape of tissue is not formed
 unki rachana utak se bhinn hoti he tathaa unki vruddhi bahut hi drut veg se hoti he
 They circulate in the body quickly and induce healthy ingredients inside
 is aantarik prasaaran kii kriya ko metastasis kehete hai
 For this reason, they are also very deadly and because of this they are called deadly, wicked, or few tumors
 manushya sharir main jab koi rogotpadak jeevanuon kaa akraman hota he, to sharir ke andar prakruti unka ghortam pratirodh karti he or isi yuddh main sharir ke bali kosh un bahari jeevanuon kaa bal nasht karke sharir ko rog se bachaa lete hai
 This curative power produced from inside the body is called immunity
 pratiraksha do prakaar kii hoti he : Natural immunity - The natural force that is produced inside the body in resistance to a disease is called natural immunity
 arjeet pratiraksha - kisi vyakti main kisi vishesh rog ke pratirodh kii shakti yadi nahin he or peeche se swayan yaa kisi anya upayon dwaara usamen us rog ke pratirodh kii shakti paidaa kar di jaae, to use arjeet pratiraksha kah sakate hai
 For example, some germs that produce cholera, smallpox, pearl, tetanus, etc
 are small that can cause disease once they enter the body, but produce small amounts of immunity against disease
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki ek vish adhik maatra main hone se sharir main vyaadhi utpann karata he, kintu vahi vish atyalp maatra main rahane se pratiraksha paidaa karata he

 kisi bhashaa main kahi yaa likhi gayi baat kaa kisi duusari bhashaa main sarthak parivartan anuwaad kehalaata he
 The work of translation has been done since very old times
 sanskrit main 'anuwaad' shabd kaa upyog shishy dwaara guru kii baat ke duhraaye jane, punah kathan, samarthan ke liye prayukt kathan, aavriti jaise kai sandarbhon main kiya gaya he
 The word ‘translation’ is derived from the ‘vad’ metal of Sanskrit
 ’vad‘ kaa arth he bolnaa
 Adding the suffix 'a' to the 'vad' metal has its changed form in the expressive noun 'vad' which means 'action to say' or 'said thing'
 'vaad' main 'anu' upsarg upsarg jodakar 'anuwaad' shabd bana he, jiskaa arth he, praapt kathan ko punah kahana
 It was first used by Monier Williams as a synonym for the English word translation
 iske baad hi 'anuwaad' shabd kaa prayog ek bhashaa main kisi ke dwaara prastut kii gai saamagree kii duusari bhashaa main punah prastuti ke sandarbh main kiya gaya
 In fact, translation is the best way to identify the rainbow form of language
 anuwaad kii anivaaryta ko kisi bhashaa kii samruddhi kaa shor machaa kar taala nahin ja saktaa or na anuwaad kii bahukoniya upyogita se inkaar kiya ja saktaa he
 JT chhis
 The accepted meaning of the word 'translation' as a synonym of JPV is to reach the idea content of one language to another language
 anuwaad ke liye hindi main 'ultha' kaa prachlan bhi he
 Along with TRANSLATION in English, there is also the practice of TRANSCRIPTION, which is called 'transliteration' in Hindi
 anuwaad or lipyantaran kaa antar is udhaaharan se spasht he- It is clear from this that the Hindi translation in 'translation' is presented in English, whereas in transliteration the thing written in the Nagari script is kept only in the Roman script
 anuwaad ke liye 'bhashaantar' or 'roopaantar' kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa rahaa he
 But now new meanings and uses of both these words are prevalent
 'bhashaantar' or 'roopaantar' kaa prayog angreji ke INTERPRETATION shabd ke paryaay-swaroop hota he, jiskaa arth he do vyaktiyon ke bich bhashik sampark sthapit karnaa
 The linguistic distance between a Kannada-speaking person and an Assamese-speaking person is overcome by interpretation
 'roopaantar' shabd in dinon praayah kisi ek vidha kii rachana kii anya vidha main prastuti ke liye prayukt he
 Like, Premchand's novel 'godan' has been adapted into a drama 'hori'
 kisi bhashaa main abhivyakt vichaaron ko duusari bhashaa main yathavat prastut karnaa anuwaad he
 In this particular sense, the meaning of the word 'translation' is sure
 jis bhashaa se anuwaad kiya jaataa he, vah mulbhasha yaa strotbhasha he
 The new language to be translated from it is 'presented language' or 'target language'
 is tarah, strot bhashaa main prastut bhav yaa vichaar ko bina kisi parivartan ke lakshyabhasha main prastut karnaa hi anuwaad he
 j ek acha anuvadak vah he jo- Translation is considered an exceptionally difficult and ad hoc task
 yah ek jatil, kritrim, aavashyaktaa-janit, or ek drushti se sarjanaatmak prakriya he jisamen asaadhaaran or vishisht koti kii pratibha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is its own nature
 parantu mana jaataa he ki moulik lekhan na hone ke kaaran anuwaad ko sammaan kaa sthaan nahin miltaa he
 Because it is calculated that translation is difficult because it is not original writing - it is necessary to reiterate what was said earlier, in which it is necessary to follow many controls and restrictions
 is prakaar amaulik hone ke kaaran anuwaad kaa mahatva to kam ho gaya, parantu isi kaaran iske liye apekshit niyantranon or bandhanon ko mahatvapurn nahin samajha gaya
 The ideas of creative writers have often been discussed in this regard
 kuch vichaar is prakaar hai : The entire translation work is only an attempt to find a solution to an irreparable problem
 kisi kriti kaa anuwaad uske dosha ko badha detaa he or uske gunon ko vidrup kar detaa he
 Translations can never be successful as a genre of art
 anuvadak vanchak hote hai
 The circumstances behind the emergence of such ideas and the beliefs inspired by them are considered
 pehle anuwaad saamagree kaa bahulansh saahitiyik rachanaayen hoti thim, jinka anuwaad rachanaaon kii saahitiyik prakruti kii simaaon ke kaaran pathak kii aashaa ke anuroop nahin ho paata tha
 At the same time, it was also believed that the translation of each part of the language of the composition is required, so that no part of the original sensation is removed, and because it is not possible, the translation was placed in the category of discourse
 yah sthiti sthool rup se unnisvin shatabdi ke purvardh tak rahi jisamen anuwaad mukhya rup se vyaktigat ruchi se prerit adhik tha, saamaajik aavashyaktaa se prerit kam
 Apart from this, this type of opinion was also formed due to the quantum abundance of original writing
 duusare vishwayuddh ke pashchaat samrajyavad ke khandit hone ke falswaroop anek chote-bade raashtra swatantra hue tathaa unki asmita kaa prashn mahatvapurn ho gaya
 The constituents of the federal republics also began to become aware of their identity
 is sampark-sthapana tathaa asmita-vikaas kii sthiti main bhashaa kaa kendriya sthaan he, jo bahubhashikta kii sthiti ke rup main dikhaai padataa he
 The power of translation is inevitable in this
 iske falswaroop anuwaad pradhan rup se ek saamaajik aavashyaktaa ban gaya he
 a variety of writings began to be translated
 anuwaad kaary ek vyavsaay ho gaya
 Agencies to train translators were established, in which short-term and full-time courses and workshops etc
 were organized
 iskaa yah bhi parinaam hua ki ek or to anuwaad ke prati saamaajik drushtikon badla tathaa duusari ore gyanatmak drushti se anuwaad siddhanth ke vikaas ko vishesh bal mila tathaa anuwaad prashikshan paathyakramon ke liye anuwaad siddhanth kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar kiya gaya
 As a result, the translation theory became a relatively independent enlightenment, accessible to all three, including translator, translation teacher, and translation critic
 anuwaad ke vishay main saiddhanthik charchaa kaa sutarapaat aadhunik yug main hi hua, aisa samajhnaa tathy or tark donon ke hi vipareet mana jane laga
 Given the long tradition of translation work, it became logical to assume that the tradition of theoretical discussion about translation work is also old
 isa purv pehali shatabdi main siciro ke lekhan main anuwaad chintan ke beej praapt hote hai or tatpashchaat bhi is vishay par vidvan apane vichaar prakat karte rahe hai
 The background of this thought has also been there, though it is not clearly defined
 yah avashya mana gaya ki jis prakaar anuwaad kaary kaa sangathit rup main hona aadhunik yug kii dein he, usee prakaar anuwaad siddhanth kii apekshaakrit suparibhaashit prishthbhumi kaa viksit hona bhi aadhunik yug kii dein he
 The main feature of the modern context of translation theory is its multilateralism
 yah kisi ekanvit prishthbhumi par aadhaarit na hokar anek parantu paraspar sambaddh shastron kii samanvit prishthbhumi par aadhaarit he, jinke prasangochit anshon se vah prishthbhumi nirmit he
 The main scriptures are text science, communication theory, language use theory, and comparative applied linguistics
 yah spasht karnaa bhi uchit hoga ki ek ore maanav anuwaad tathaa yantrik anuwaad, tathaa duusari ore likhit anuwaad or maukhik anuwaad ke vyaavhaarik mahatva ke kaaran inke saiddhanthik paksh ke vishay main bhi chintan armbh hone laga he
 However, the translation of humanized written medium has been considered to be of quantitative and qualitative precedence and the issues of theoretical thinking related to them are particularly relevant
 yadhyapi pracheen bhartiya parampara main anuwaad chintan kii parampara utane vyavasthit tathaa lekhabaddh rup main praapt nahin hoti, jis prakaar pashchim main, tathaapi anuwaad chintan ke beej avashya uplabdh hai
 Accordingly, translation is repetition - re-telling a message expressed in one language to another
 anuwaad ke prati yah drushti pashchimi parampara main sweekrut dharna se bahya str par hi bhinn prathit hoti he
 But by adopting this vision, many theoretical points related to translation have been given more vivid and relevant interpretation
 isi sambandh main duusari drushti dwandvatmakataa kii he
 Which is modern and mainly the result of structuralism
 anuwaad kaary kii parampara ko dekhne se yah spasht he ki anawaad siddhanth sambandhi chintan saahitiyik kritiyon ko lekar hi adhik hua he
 This situation is also true
 vigat yug main saahitiyik kritiyon ko hi anuwaad ke liye chunaa jaataa tha
 Even now translations of literary works are more frequent
 tathaapi, paristhitiyon ke anurodh se ab saahityetar lekhan kaa anuwaad bhi adhik maatra main hone laga he
 The special thing is that there is a fundamental difference between the writings of the two categories
 jise lekhak kii vyaktinishthata tathaa nirvaiyaktikta kii shabdaawalee main adhik spasht reeti se prakat kar sakate hai
 Individual writing, by virtue of its nature, has its own context
 yah kahkar ham donon kii ubhaynishth prishthbhumi kaa nishedh nahin kar rahe, parantu prastut sandarbh main ham donon kii duuri or aapekshik swaittata ko vishesh rup se ubhaarna chaahate hai
 It is only appropriate that the theoretical context of translation of non-personal writings from the side of linguistics be particularly highlighted
 anuwaad siddhanth kaa ek vikasman aayam he anusandhan kii pravriti
 Due to the multidisciplinary nature of translation theory, experts in various fields — philologist, sociologist, psychologist, academician, anthropologist, information theory expert — became interested in research work on the theoretical parts of translation with mutual cooperation
 anuwaad kaary kaa kshetra badhata gaya
 Connections between people of different cultures increased - people went abroad for education, business-industrial organizations worked in different countries, people of different languages sat together in conferences and exchanged, diplomatic agreements started between nations
 in sabhi main anuwaad kii anivaary rup se aavashyaktaa prathit hui or anuwaad kii vishisht samasyaayen ubharne lagi
 The study of these problems became a fertile field of research related to translation
 ek ore bhashaa or samskruti tathaa duusari ore bhashaa or vichaar ke madhya sambandh par anuwaad dwaara prastut sakshya ke aadhaar par nayaa chintan saamne aayaa
 New possibilities began to emerge in the areas of machine translation and oral translation, which gave impetus to translation research in these areas
 maanav anuwaad tathaa likhit anuwaad ke paramparaagat kshetron par bhi bhashaa adhyayan kii nai drushtiyon ne visheshgyon ko nutan paddati se vichaar karne ke liye prerit kiya
 From all these trends, the theory of Anavad started getting the status of prestige and it started getting acceptance as an appropriate field of theoretical research

 The legend of Babel's tower is famous, which points to the fact that, many languages are spoken in human society
 yah tarksangat rup se anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki parsparik sampark kii saamaajik anivaaryta ke kaaran anuwaad vyavhaar kaa janm bhi bahut pehle ho gaya hoga
 But as far as the written evidence is concerned, brihat str par anuwaad tabhi hota he, jab do bhinn bhashabhashi samudaayon main dirghakaal paryant sampark bana rahe tathaa use santulit karne ke prayaas ke antargat alp viksit samskruti ke log suviksit samskruti ke logon ke sahitya kaa anuwaad kar apane sahitya ko samrudh karen
 Prachara translations from Greek to Latin and Arabic to European languages are believed to be the result of this trend
 anuwaad kaary ko itihaas kii pravritiyon kii drushti se do bhaagon main vibhajit kija jaataa he - pracheen or aadhunik
 Translations of three types of compositions are mainly received in the ancient era
 kyonki in teen kshetron main hi praayah granthon kii rachana hoti thi
 These fields are - literature, philosophy and religion
 saahitiyik rachanaaon main greek ke elliod or odesi, sanskrit ke ramayana or mahabharat aise granth hai, jinka vyapak str anuwaad hua
 Plato's dialogues in philosophical works became popular from the point of view of translation
 dharmik rachanaaon main bible ke sabase adhik anuwaad paae jate hai
 Through the translation of modern era, these great texts of ancient era are now available to different languages
 anuwaad takanic kii drushti se in anuwaadon kii visheshta yah he ki, pracheen yug main ye anuwaad vishesh rup se ekapaksheeya rup main hote the arthath jis bhashaa main anuwaad kiye jate the unase unki kisi rachana kaa mul granth bhashaa main anuwaad nahin hota tha
 The reason for this is that the texts of the target language were often not so excellent compared to the original texts, secondly, it was considered improper to use as the target language due to the high regard for the language of the original texts
 aadhunik yug main anuwaad kaa kshetra vistrut ho gaya he
 The texts and compositions of the above mentioned three areas of science, technology, medicine, administration, diplomacy, law, public relations and many other areas have also come into being
 pracheen yug ke anuwaadon kii tulana main aadhunik yug ke anuwaad dwipaksheeya rup main hote hai
 The economic and political importance of translation has also become prestigious in the modern era
 vibhinn rashtron ke madhya raajnneetik, aarthik or saanskrithik anubandhon ke prapatr ke dwibhashik paath taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Multinational institutions have to use more than one language
 sanyukt raashtra main prayek kaary paanch yaa chah bhashaaon main kiya jaataa he
 All of this essentially requires translation
 is sthiti kaa auchity bhi he
 As a result of the industrial, technological, economic and political revolution in the modern era, the consciousness of the need for close contact with each other in the nations of the world has developed very quickly, due to which translation is considered natural to get this importance
 yahi kaaran he ki yadi pracheen yug kii prerak shakti anuvadak kii vyaktigat ruchi adhik thi, to aadhunik yug main anuwaad kii saamaajik-aarthik-raajnneetik aavashyaktaa ek prabal prerak shakti banakar saamne ai he
 There are many examples of this situation
 bhashaayi alpsankhyak varg ke lekhakon kii rachanaayen duusari bhashaaon main anudit hokar adhik padhi jaati hai
 Relatively small and multi-lingual nations face the problem of establishing contacts between different linguistic communities within their own country
 saamaajik aavashyaktaa ke anuroop anuwaad ke is mahatva ke kaaran anuwaad kaary ab sangathit rup se hota dekha jaataa he
 To meet the needs arising due to political-economic reasons, translation has now become a business and as it is personal, its organizational form also seems to be distinguished
 anuwaad kaushal ko sikhaane ke liye shiksha sansthaaon main prabandh kiye jate hai tathaa swatantra rup se bhi prashikshan santhaan kaam karte hai
 Translation as a specific kind of linguistic trade, from the Indian tradition point of view, is not new
 vastutah 'anuwaad' shabd or usase uplakshith bhashik vyapaar bhartiya parampara main bahut pehle se chale aae hai
 Therefore, with the help of the etymological and prophetic meanings of the word 'translation' and its English synonym 'translation', the definition and form of translation can be better known
 'anuwaad' kaa vyutpattimulak arth he - punah kathan; ek baar kahi hui baat ko dobaaraa kahana
 It consists of repetition of meaning, not of word
 'transleshan' shabd kaa vyutpattimulak arth he 'parvahan' arthath ek sthaan-bindu se duusare sthaan-bindu par le janaa
 This is a place-point language text
 isamen bhi le jaai jane vaali vastu arth hota he, shabd nahin
 The difference in both the above words is in terms of etymological meaning, hence superficial
 vaastavik vyavhaar main donon kii samanta spasht he
 The repetition of meaning is called in other words and by interpretation, the interpretation of meaning, in which the morphological-constitutive features of the original language are sometimes transposed into the target language
 vastutah 'anuwaad' shabd kaa bhartiya parampara vaala arth aadhunik sandarbh main bhi maanya he or isi ko kendra bindu banaakar anuwaad kii prakruti ko anshashah samajha jaataa he
 Accordingly, there are three references to translation work - bilingual, dialectical and intertextual
 sambhashik sandarbh main arth kii punrariti ek hi bhashaa kii seemaa ke antargat hoti he, parantu iske aayam bhinn-bhinn ho jate hai
 The main dimensions are two - chronological and synchronous
 kalkramik aayam par sambhashik anuwaad ek hi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kii do nearesth avasthaaon main hota he, jaise, puraani hindi se aadhunik hindi main anuwaad
 Synchronous translation on the synchronous dimension mainly takes place at three levels - dialect, style and medium
 boli str par sambhashik anuwaad ke chaar upstar ho sakate hai : From one geographical dialect to another geographical dialect; Like in Braj to Awadhi
 amanak boli se maanak boli main; jaise ganjam oriya se puri kii oriya main athwa nagpur marathi se pune marathi main
 Dialectively in language form, like Braj or Awadhi to Hindi ek saamaajik boli se duusari saamaajik boli main, jaise ashikshiton yaa alpashikshiton kii bhashaa se shikshiton kii bhashaa main yaa ek dharm main dikshit logon kii bhashaa se anya dharm main dikshit logon kii bhashaa main
 At the genre level, bilingual translation can also be seen as genre-substitute
 iskaa ek acha udhaaharan he aupchaarik style se anaupchaarik style main anuwaad; jaise ‘dhumrapaan varjit he' → ‘bidi cigarette pinaa manaa he' 
 Similarly, there is no symmetry in 'tubular air transfusion'
 he' -> 'tair kii hawa nikal gai he' 
 From the point of view of medium, there is a situation of linguistic translation where the message presented in the oral medium is repeated in the written medium or vice versa; For example, there is a sentence in the oral medium: "due to the time limit, i will not be able to tell my listeners about this in more detail
 " isi ko likhit madhyam main is prakaar se kahana sambhavtah uchit mana jaataa he : "sthaan kii seemaa ke kaaran main apane pathakon ko adhik vistaar se is vishay kaa spashtikaran nahin kar sakunga
 "
 sambhashik anuwaad ke uparyukt udaahranon se do baaten spasht hoti hai
 In the process of semantics or repetition of meaning, both words and syntax are affected
 madhyam anuwaad main svanaprakriya kii visheshtaayen likhit vyavastha kii visheshtaon kaa rup le leti hai yaa iske vipareet hota he
 There is not a rigid dividing line between the dimensions of dialect, style, and medium, but only partial overlap is found in them, the possibility of which lies in the tendency to use language
 jaise, shailigat anuwaad kii aanshik satta madhyam anuwaad main dikhaai detii he, or tadnusaar 'ke vishay main bataa paanaa' jaisaa maukhik madhyam kaa, at ev anaupchaarik, chayan, likhit madhyam main aupchaarikta kaa sparsh letaa hua 'kaa spashtikaran kar sakna' ho jaataa he
 Similarly, in stylistic translation, social spoken translation is also sometimes included
 jaise, shikshiton kii boli main, aupchaarik style kii pradhanta kii pravriti ho sakati he or alpashikshiton yaa ashikshiton kii boli main anaupchaarik style kii
 Problems of bilingual translation are not only interesting but also important in terms of other bilingual translation
 anuwaad ko bhashaprayog kii ek vidha ke rup main dekhne par sambhashik anuwaad kaa mahatva or bhi spasht ho jaataa he
 Apart from this, understanding the nature of bilingual translation is not only helpful, but also necessary in terms of understanding the nature of other bilingual translation
 ye kaha ja saktaa he ki anuwaad vyutpann bhashaprayog he, jiske do sandarbh hai - sambhashik or anybhashik
 In this context, there is a difference in translation behavior, but in both cases the nature of translation remains the same
 anybhashik anuwaad do bhashaaon ke bich main hota he
 These two languages are recognized as independent languages on a coordinated criterion of historicity and regionality
 aitihaasik drushti se ek hi dhara main aane vaali bhashaaon ko saamanytah us sthiti main swatantra bhashaa ke rup main dekhte hai yadi vah kalkram main ek duusare ke nikat sannihit na hon, jaise sanskrit or hindi; in donon ke madhya praakrit bhashaayen aa jaati hai
 Likewise, in terms of regionalism, even if they are highly respected in the Adivasi languages, they will have to consider different languages, such as Hindi and Punjabi
 anybhashik anuwaad ke sandarbh main sambandhit bhashaaon kaa swatantra astitv mahatva kii baat hoti he
 Other bilingual translation is more important socially and practically than the linguistic translation
 bhashaprayog kii drushti se anybhashik anuwaad kii samasyaon main sambhashik anuwaad kii samasyaon se gunatmak antar dikhaai padataa he
 Thus, despite relating to bilingual translation, other bilingual translation is relatively private business
 anuwaad shabd ke uparyukt donon sandarbh apekshaakrit simit hai
 In these, translation has been considered as the trade of languages
 vastutah bhashaa-sanket, sanketon kii ek vishisht shrenee he, jinke dwaara sampreshan kaary sampann hota he
 Signs of different categories are used for communication
 inhen saamaanya sanket kaha jaataa he
 From this point of view, the word translation is also defined
 iske anusaar ek sanketon dwaara kahi gai baat ko dusri koti ke sanketon dwaara punah kahana is prakaar ke anuwaad ko antarasanketaparak anuwaad kaha jaataa he
 It is under general signology
 bhashik sanketon ko pravartan bindu maanakar sanketon ko bhashik or bhashetar main vibhakt kiya jaataa he
 There are two parts in Bhashaatar - external and internal
 anuwaad kii drushti se sanket-parivartan ke vyapaar kii nimnlikhit kotiyaan ban sakati hai : 1
 Translation of external signs into external signs - Accordingly, a map of a country is a translation of that country; a picture of a creature is a translation of that creature
 2
 bahya sanket kaa bhashik sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi praani ke liye kisi bhashaa main prayukt koi shabd us praani kaa anuwaad he
 From this point of view, this is really the problem of language philosophy, which has been interpreted in the hint theory of meaning
 3
 aantarik sanket se aantarik sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi ek ghatana ko uski samshil samvednaa main parivartit karnaa is shrenee kaa anuwaad he
 It is clear that this situation cannot be the real authority
 atah keval saiddhanthikta kii dashti se hi yah koti nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 4
 Translation from internal signs to linguistic signs - According to this, the use of a word for any internal sensation is a translation of this category
 isko adhik spashtataa se kaha jaataa he ki, kisi bhautik sthiti ke saath sampark hone par - jaise, kisi durghatana ko dekhakar, prakruti ke kisi drishy ko dekhakar, kisi vastu ko haath lagaakar, kuch sanghakar; duusare shabdon main indriyaarth sannikarsh hone par - man main jis samvednaa kaa udai hota he vah ek prakaar kaa sanket he
 For him, using any language word or repeating it with linguistic signs will be called translation of this category
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vishisht prakaar kii vednaa kaa sanket karne ke liye hindi main ‘shok' shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or duusari ke liye 'prem' kaa
 One sensation is believed to be translated by the word 'mourning' and the other by 'love'
 is drushti se yah kaha jaataa he ki samast moulik abhivyakti anuwaad he
 The speaker or writer repeats their sensory signals into linguistic signs
 is drushti se yah bhashaa manovigyaan kii samasya he, jisaki vyakhya uddipan-anukriya siddhanth main kii gai he
 Thus, translations have the place of translations of all three references in the wider range of the word - linguistic translation, linguistic translation, and intertextual translation
 teenon kaa apana-apana saiddhanthik aadhaar he
 It is important to know the difference between these three
 anuvadak ko yah sthir karnaa he ki in teenon main kendriya sthiti kiski he tathaa shesh do kaa unke saath kaisaa sambandh he
 From the point of view of theoretical justification, the position of dialectical translation is central
 keval ‘anuwaad' shabd se anybhashik anuwaad kaa arth grahan kiya jaataa he
 Its root is bilingualism
 anuvadak kaa bodhan tathaa abhivyakti donon sthitiyon main hi bhashaa se bandhe rahete hai or ye bhashaayen bhi bhed kii drushti se nahin, api tu code kii drushti se bhinn-bhinn hoti hai; jaise hindi or angreji, hindi or sindhi aadi
 This central position has two ends
 pratham chor par donon sthitiyon main bhashabaddhata rahati he, parantu bhashaa vahi rahati he
 The difference of positions is based on the difference of differences in the same language
 yah sambhashik anuwaad he
 For clarity of the use of technical terms, it is called 'exploration' or 'translation'
 doosar chor par bhashetar sanket kaa bhashik sanket main parivartan hota he
 This change of signaling method leads to the normal state of language use
 paribhaashik shabdaawalee main ise 'bhashaa vyavhaar' kaha jaataa he
 These three have both relation and difference
 yah sambandh ubhaynishth he
 The important thing from the translation point of view is that translators are helped by concepts of bilingual translation and intertextual translation in the actual translation work and in the evaluation of translated text
 yah aavashyaktaa tabhi mukhar rup se saamne aati he, jab anuwaad karte-karte anuvadak kabhi atak jate hai -mul paath kaa samyak bodhan nahin ho paaten, lakshyabhasha main shuddh or upyukt anuwaad kaa paryaaptatya anveshan karne main kathinaayee hoti he, anuvadak ko yah jaanchna hota he ki anuwaad kitna safal he, ityadi
 In the parlance, the word 'translation' refers to the dialectical translation
 or isi kaaran shaniah shaniah yah baat siddhanth kaa bhi ang ban gai he ki anuwaad do bhashaaon ke madhya hone vaali prakriya he
 This condition is accepted
 sanskrit parampara kaa 'chaaya' shabd isi sthiti kaa sanket karne ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he
 The definition of translation is particularly helpful for understanding the nature of translation
 anuwaad kii bahupaksheeyata ko dekhte hue anuwaad kii paribhaasha vibhinn drushtikonon se prastut kii gai he
 The main approaches are of three types - translation is a process
 anuwaad ek prakriya athwa / or uskaa parinaam he
 Translation is the name of a relation
 is drushtikon ke antargat nimnlikhit paribhaashaayen uddhrut kii jaati hai : "translation is the act of presenting the equivalent message in the target language
 sandeshon kii yah moolyasmata pehle arth or phir style kii drushti se, tathaa nikatatam evam swaabhaavik hoti he
 " "anuwaad vah prakriya he, jiske dwaara sarthak anubhav ek bhashaa-samudaay se duusare bhashaa-samudaay ko sampreshit kiya jaataa he
 " "ek bhashaa kii paathyasaamagree ko duusari bhashaa kii samanarthak paathyasaamagree dwaara prasthaapit karnaa anuwaad kehalaata he
