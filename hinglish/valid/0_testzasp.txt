 terahavin putali kirtimati ne is prakaar katha kahi- Once King Vikramaditya organized a Mahabhoja
 us bhoj main asankhya viddhan, brahman, vyapaaree tathaa darbari aamantrit the
 In the middle of the banquet, there was discussion about who is the biggest donor in the world
 sabhi ne ek swar se vikramaditya ko duniya kaa sarvshereshth daanveer ghoshit kiya
 King Vikramaditya was watching the sentiments of the people
 tabhi unki nazar ek brahman par padi jo apni raay nahin de rahaa tha
 But it was clear from his facial expressions that he did not agree with the idea of all people
 vikram ne usase uski chuppi kaa matlab poocha to vah darate hue bolaa ki sabase alag raay dene par koun uski baat sunegaa
 When the king asked his idea, he said that he was in a state of confusion
 agar vah sach nahin bataata, to use jhooth kaa paap lagata he or sach bolne kii sthiti main use dar he ki raja kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padegaa
 Now Vikram's curiosity increased
 unhone uski spashtvaadita kii bhari-bhuri prashansa kii tathaa use nirbhay hokar apni baat kehane ko kaha
 Then he said that Maharaj Vikramaditya is very big donor - this is true but not the biggest donor on this land
 yah sunate hi sab chaunke
 Everyone was surprised and asked it is possible? On that the Brahmin said that there is a kingdom across the sea, where the king Kirikittadhwaj does not even accept food and water until he donates one lakh gold coins daily
 agar yah baat asaty pramanit hoti he, to vah brahman koi bhi dand paane ko taiyaar tha
 There was a flutter in the King's huge banquet hall
 brahman ne bataaya ki kirkittadhvaj ke rajya main vah kai dinon tak rahaa or pratidin swarna mudra lene gaya
 In fact, the kirkittadhvaj takes food only by donating one lakh gold currencies
 yahi kaaran he ki bhoj main upasthit saare logon kii haan-main-haan usne nahin milaai
 King Vikramaditya was pleased with the candor of the Brahmin and he gave him the reward and took him away
 brahman ke jane ke baad raja vikramaditya ne saadhaaran vesh dharaa or donon betaalon kaa samaran kiya
 When both betals appeared, they asked them to take King Kirkitadhvaja across the sea to the kingdom
 betaalon ne palak jhapakate hi unhen vahaan pahunchaa diya
 Arriving at the gate of Kirkittadhwaj's palace, he introduced himself as an ordinary citizen of the city of Ujjayini and expressed his desire to meet Kirkittadhwaja
 kuch samay baad jab ne kirkittadhvaj ke saamne upasthit hue, to unhone uske yahan naukari kii maang kii
 When Kirkittadhwaj asked what work he could do, he would show what he could not do
 raja kirkittadhvaj ko unka jawaab pasand aayaa or vikramaditya ko uske yahan naukari mil gai
 He was appointed as the gatekeeper
 unhone dekha ki raja kirkittadhvaj sachmuch har din ek lakh swarna mudraayen jab tak daan nahin kar letaa ann-jal grahan nahin karata he
 He also saw that King Kirikittadhvaja walks out alone in the evening and when he returns, he has a bag full of one lakh gold coins in his hand
 ek din shaam ko unhone chhipakar kirkittadhvaj kaa peechha kiya
 He saw that King Kirkitadhvaja bathed in the sea and went to a temple and worshiped a statue and jumped into a cauldron of boiling oil
 jab uskaa sharir jal-bhun jaataa he, to kuch joganiyaan aakar uskaa jala-bhunaa sharir kadaah se nikaalkar noch-noch kar khaati hai or trupt hokar chali jaati hai
 After the Jogunis leave, the goddess of the idol appears and pours drops of nectar to resurrect the Kirkittadhvaja
 apane haathon se ek lakh swarna mudraayen kirkittadhvaj kii jholii main jaal detii he or kirkittadhvaj khush hokar mahal laut jaataa he
 In the morning, he donates the same gold currency to the petitioners
 vikram kii samaj main uske nity ek lakh swarna mudraayen daan karne kaa rahasy aa gaya
 The next day, after King Kirkittadhwaja had received the golden postures, Vikram also took a bath and worshiped the goddess and jumped into the cauldron of oil
 joganiyaan jab unke jaale-bhune sharir ko nochakar khaakar chali gayi to devi ne unako jivit kiya
 When the goddess did not want to give him gold postures when alive, he refused, saying that the grace of the goddess is paramount for him
 yah kriya unhone saat baar duharai
 For the seventh time Devi asked him to settle down and asked him to ask for anything
 vikram isi avasar kii taak main the
 He asked Goddess for the bag from which the gold currencies came out
 jyonhi devi ne vah thili unhen saunpi- chamatkaar hua
 Temple, Statue - Everything disappeared
 ab dur tak keval samudr tat dikhataa tha
 The next day when Kirkittadhwaj came there, he was very disappointed
 uskaa varshon kaa ek lakh swarna mudraayen daan karne kaa niyam tut gaya
 After leaving food and water, he remained helpless in his room
 uskaa sharir ksheen hone laga
 When his condition began to worsen, Vikram went to him and wanted to know the reason for his sadness
 usne vikram ko jab sab kuch khud bataaya to vikram ne use devi vaali thili dete hue kaha ki rose-rose kadah main use kudakar praan ganvaate dekh ve dravit ho gaye, isliye unhone devi se vah thili hi sadaa ke liye praapt kar lee
 By giving that bag to King Kirkittadhwaj, he also protected that promise by giving him a job in the court of Kirkittadhwaj
 unhone sachmuch vahi kaam kar dikhaaya jo koi bhi nahin kar saktaa he
 King Kirkittadhwaj, after getting acquainted with them, placed him on his chest and said that he is truly the best donor on this earth, because he donated the sachet of money which was obtained after so much difficulty, as if something was trivial

 One problem with illicit cocaine use, especially in long-term users to fight high amounts of fatigue, is the risk of bad effects or damage caused by compounds used in adulteration
 Erosion or "stamping" on drugs is common, using compounds that give a false impression of the ingestion effect, such as novocaine, which cause temporary anesthesia, as many users believe, with intense numb effects, hard and / or pure cocaine, Ephedrine or such stimulants, which produce an increase in heart rate, are the result of

 Cocaine in its pure form is a white, pearl-colored product
 powder ke rup main pradarshit hone vaala kokene ek namak he, aam taur par kokene hydrochloride 
 Common market cocaine is often adulterated or "cut" with various substances such as powder to increase its weight; The most common substance used in this process is baking soda; Sugars in the form of lactose, dextrose, inositol, and mannitol; And local anesthesia, such as lidocaine or benzocaine that mimic or exacerbate the numbing effect of cocaine on the mucous screen
 kokene ko anya uttejk jaise, methamphetamine ke saath bhi "cat" kiya ja saktaa he
 Adulterated cocaine is often white, light-white, or pink powder
 "crack" kokene kaa rang kai karkon par nirbhar karata he, jisamen shaamil he istemaal kiye gaye kokene kii utpatti, taiyaar karne kii vidhi - ammonia yaa baking soda ke saath - or gandagee kii upasthiti, lekin aam taur par yah safed se pile kriim or ek halke bhure rang kaa hota he
 Its texture also depends on the process of adulteration, origin and processing of powdered cocaine, and the method of changing the base

 coca herbal saar, coca pattee ke utpaadak deshon main prayog kiya jaataa he, jaise ki koi anya aushadhiy jadi-booti saar vishwa ke anya bhaagon main hota he
 The independent and legal commercialization of dry coca leaves in the form of filtration bags for use as "coca tea" has been actively promoted for many years by the governments of Peru and Bolivia as a medicinal power drink
 peru main kajko shahar or bolivia main laa paaz main aagantukon kaa swaagat coca pattee ke saar ko pesh karke kiya jaataa he taaki, manyatanusaar, nav-aagatuk yatriyon ko ucch kshetra kii bimaari se ubaarane main madad kii ja sake
 The effect of drinking coca tea is seen in a mild sensation and good mood
 yah munh ko sunn nahin karata he or naa hi yah kokene soonghney kii tarah aaveg detaa he
 To prevent the malformed use of this product, its advocates propagate the unproven concept that most of the effect of coca leaf extract intake comes from secondary alkaloids, as it is not only quantitatively different from pure cocaine
 But also qualitatively different
 yah kokene nirbharta ke upachaar ke liye ek sahaushadhi ke rup main prachaarit kiya gaya he
 In a controversial study, coca leaf infusion was used - in addition to counseling - to treat 23 people who smoked coca paste in Lima, Peru
 prayaavartan, coca chaay se ilaaj se pehle prati maah chaar ke ausat se gir kar upachaar ke dauraan ek ke ausat par aa gaya
 The duration of abstinence increased from an average of 32 days before treatment, to 217 days during treatment
 in parinaamon se pataa chalata he ki coca pattee saar ke saath-saath paraamarsh kaa prayog karnaa, kokene kii lat ke ilaaj ke dauraan punrariti rokane ke liye ek prabhavi tarika hoga
 Importantly, these results also strongly suggest that the pharmacologically primary active metabolite in coca leaf extract is actually cocaine and not secondary alkaloids
 kokene metabolit benzoyalgonin ko, coca pattee saar kaa ek cap pine ke kuch ghante baad, logon ke mutr main paaya ja saktaa he
 Many users rub this powder on the gum line, or draw it in the breath through a cigarette filter, which numbs the gums and teeth - hence this type of intake is colloquially referred to as "moist" in English, "gummers" or "cocoa puffs" are named
 yah zyaadaatar pradhaman ke baad, sataha par bachi kokene kii choti maatra ke saath kiya jaataa he
 Another oral method is to swallow a little cocaine wrapped in round paper
 It is sometimes called "snow Bomb" in English

 The juice is gradually absorbed by the inner mucous membrane of the cheek and by the gastrointestinal tract when swallowed
 Alternatively, coca leaves can be soaked in water and used as tea
 coca pattiyon ko khaanaa aam taur par kokene seven kaa ek prabhaavaheen tarika he
 Those advocating the use of coca leaf say that consumption of coca leaf should not be declared criminal because it is not genuine cocaine and as a result it is not a truly illegal drug
 kyonki kokene kaa jaleey sanlayan hota he or amleey pet main yah niskriy ho jaataa he, jab ise akele khaaya jaataa he to yah aasaani se avashoshit nahin hota he
 Only when it is mixed with a highly alkaline substance can it be absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach

 First, the drug is partially catabolized by the liver
 doosraa, munh ke andar keshika or annapranali is drug ke saath sampark ke baad sikudti he or us sataha kshetra ko kam karti he jis par is drug ko avashoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Nevertheless, cocaine metabolites can be found in the urine of a person who drank only one cup of coca leaf infusion
 isliye, yah kokene ke seven kaa ek vaastavik atirikt rup he, yadhyapi ek aksham tarika he
 Orally consumed cocaine is found in the bloodstream in about 30 minutes
 aam taur par, maukhik khuraaq kii ek tihaai hi avashoshit hoti he, haalanki niyantrit sthitiyon main avasorana ko 60% tak pahunchate hue dikhaaya gaya he
 Given the slow rate of absorption, the maximum physiological and narcotic effect dominates approximately 60 minutes after cocaine ingestion
 jabaki in prabhaavon kii shuruuaat dhimi he, prabhaav apane charam par pahunchane ke baad lagbhag 60 minute tak bana rahata he
 Contrary to popular belief, both food and perfusion result in approximately the same proportion of drug being absorbed: 30 to 60%
 Compared to food, the rapid absorption of cocaine by elimination results in quicker recovery of the drug's maximum effect
 naak se soonghney par kokene, 40 minute ke andar adhiktam shaareerik prabhaav or 20 minute ke andar adhiktam maadak prabhaav utpann karti he, baharhaal, ek adhik yathartwaadee sakriyan kii avadhi 5 se 10 minute he, jo kokene ke khaane ke baraabar he

 It has been responsible for many deaths, including celebrities such as John Belushi, Chris Farley, Mitch Hedberg, River Phoenix and Len Stelle
 prayog ke rup main, kokene injection ko cocaine kii lat kii kriyavidhi kaa adhyayan karne ke liye pashuon ko diya ja saktaa he jaise makkhiyaan
 Breathing or smoking is one of several methods of cocaine consumption
 taap dwaara thos kokene kii uthati bhaap kaa dhumrapaan kiya jaataa he
 In a 2000 study by the Brookhaven National Laboratory Department of Medicine, based on the own experience of the 32 addicts who took part in the study, the "peak peak" was found at a mean of 1
4 minutes + / - 0
5 minutes freebase yaa crack kokene kaa dhumrapaan aksar ek choti si shishe kii nalee se bane pipe se kiya jaataa he, jise aksar "lav rojez" se liya jaataa he, shishe kii ek choti nalee jisamen ek gulab hota he or jise ek prempurna uphaar ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 These are sometimes called "stems", "horns", "blasters" and "straight shooters"
 tambe kaa ek saaf baari tukdaa yaa kabhi-kabhi steneles steel kaa ek chota sa saafe pad – jise aksar "brilo" kaha jaataa he, yaa "chow", chow boy brands ke tambe ke saafe pad ke naam par aadhaarit, – ek apchayan aadhaar or pravaah adhimishrak kaa kaam karata he jisamen yah "pathar" pighalaaya or ubaal kar bhaap banaaya ja saktaa he
 Crack smokers sometimes smoke through a small hole in the bottom of a soda can
 crack ko pipe ke ant main rakhkar piya jaataa he; uske paas aag kii ek choti lapat rakhane se bhaap paidaa hoti he, jise dhumrapaan karne vaala phir saanson main khinchataa he
 The effects felt almost immediately after smoking are very intense and do not last long - usually five to fifteen minutes
 jab iskaa dhumrapaan kiya jaataa he, to kokene ko kabhi-kabhi anya drug ke saath mila liya jaataa he jaise canbis, jise aksar ghumaakar golakaar kar liya jaataa he
 Powdered cocaine is also occasionally smoked, although most of the chemical is destroyed by the heat; Smokers often sprinkle it on marijuana
 kokene dhumrapaan ke upkaran or tareekon kii charchaa karne vaali bhashaa main bhinnata he, jaisaa ki baazaaroo bikri main iske packing tareeke main he
 Cocaine pharmacology involves complex linkages to neurotransmitters
 The most intensively studied effect of cocaine on the central nervous system is the inhibition of dopamine transporter proteins
 The dopamine transmitter released during the neural signal is usually renewed via the transporter, that is, the transporter binds the transmitter and passes it out of the synaptic cleft and sends it back to the presynaptic neuron, where it is taken into the storage vesicle 
 kokene, dopamin transporter par kasakar baandhta he or ek sankul banaata he jo transporter ke kaaryon ko block karata he
 The dopamine transporter can no longer perform its own function of reuse and thus dopamine accumulates in the synaptic cleft
 isse praapt hote neuron par dopamin receptors par dopaminargik sanketan ke syneptic pashchaat ke prabhaav badhate hai or lambey samay tak rahete hai
 Prolonged cocaine exposure, as in the case of addiction, induces homeostatic dysregulation of normal dopaminergic signaling, through down-regulation of dopamine receptors and enhanced signal transduction
 kokene istemaal kii puraani lat ke baad nune dopaminargik sanket, avsaadagrastata jaise vikaron ko utpann kar sakate hai or kokene ke is majboot prabhaav ke prati mastishk ke is mahatvapurn inaam circuit ko samvedansheel bana sakate hai 
 This sensitivity leads to the nightmarish nature of addiction and relapse
 dopamin sampann mastishk kshetra, jaise ventral tegmental kshetra, nabhik ekambence or agr praantastha, kokene lat ke anusandhan ke aksar lakshya rahe hai
 Of particular interest is the pathway that is made up of dopaminergic neurons originating in the ventral tegmental region and which terminate in the nucleus accumbens
 yah prakshepan "inaam centre" ke rup main kaary kar saktaa he, is myne main ki yah bhojan yaa maithun jaise prakritik puraskaar ke alaava kokene jaise bure drug kii pratikriya main sakriyata dikhaata he
 While the exact role of dopamine in the subjective experience of reward is highly controversial among neuroscientists, the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is widely believed to be at least partially responsible for the spectacular effects of cocaine
 yah pariklpana mukhyatah prayogshaala ke aankadon par aadhaarit hai jisamen kokene kaa khud seven karne vaale prashikshit chuuhe shaamil hai
 If dopamine antagonists are directly transmitted to the nucleus accumbens, well-trained rats that consume cocaine on their own will become extinct, thus indicating that cocaine does not support drug-seeking behavior
 serotonin par kokene prabhaav ekaadhik serotonin receptors dikhaata he or ise 5-HT3 ke punah seven ko rokte hue dikhaaya gaya he, vishesh rup se kokene ke prabhaavon main ek mahatvapurn yogadanakarta ke rup main
 kokene main 5-HT3 receptors kii adhikta ne chuhon ko is visheshta kaa pradarshan karne ke liye anukulit kiya, tathaapi is prakriya main 5-HT3 kaa sahi prabhaav aspasht he
 The 5-HT2 receptor has shown effects in inducing hyperactivity displayed in cocaine intake
 upar chart main pradarshit kriyavidhi ke alaava, kokene ko khuli bahya-abhimukh sanrachana par DAT transporter ko sidhe sthir karte hue baandhte hue dikhaaya gaya he jabaki duusare uttejk band sanrachana ko sthir karte hai
 Furthermore, cocaine binds in such a way as to prevent endogenous hydrogen binding in the DAT, which would otherwise occur even when amphetamine and similar molecules bind
 kokene kaa badhyakaari gun aisa he ki yah jud jaataa he taaki yah hydrogen band naa ho or ise kokene anu ke kasakar band unmukhikaran ke kaaran nirmaan se avaruddh kar diya jaataa he
 Research studies show that the affinity for the transporter is not what is involved in the formation of the substance, but rather the structure and binding properties of when and where molecules bind to the transporter
 sigma receptor kokene se prabhavit hote hai, chunki cocaine, sigma ligand prachaalak peshi ke rup main kaary karata he
 Also specific receptors on which it has been shown to act are NMDA and D1 dopamine receptor
 kokene sodium channel ko bhi block karata he, jisase kaary kshamta ke prachaar ke saath hastkshep karata he; is prakaar, lignoken or novocan kii tarah, yah ek sthaneey chetanashunya karanevaali aushadhi ke rup main kaary karata he
 This dopamine and cirrotonin act at additive sites as a mechanism distinct from the reabsorption of those carriers, targeting sodium-based carrier regions; Due to the unique usefulness of its local anesthetic, it is in a different functional category than its own derivative phenyltropanes, in which they are removed, and amphetamine class stimulants, where they are completely lacking
 iske alaava, kokene ke, kappa-opiod grahi sthal par bhi kuch badhyakaari lakshya hai
 Cocaine also causes vasoconstriction, thus reducing blood flow during minor surgical procedures
 gati ko badhaane ke kokene ke gunon kaa shrey iske sabsatanshia nigra se dopaminargik sancharan kii vruddhi ko diya ja saktaa he
 Recent research points to an important role of the circadian mechanism and clock genes in cocaine effects
 chunki nicotine dimag main dopamin ke str ko badha detaa he, kokene kaa seven karne vaale kai log yah mahasoos karte hai ki cocaine prayog ke samay tambaakoo utpaadon kaa upyog unmadotsaah ko badhaata he
 This approach, however, can have undesirable consequences, such as uncontrollable continuous smoking during cocaine use, which is in addition to the harmful effects on health caused by tobacco and the extra emphasis on the cardiovascular system
 chidchidepan, mood gadabadi, bechaini, vyamoh or shravan matibhram ke alaava, kokene kaa seven kai khatarnaak shaareerik sthitiyon ko janm de saktaa he
 It can cause disturbances in heart rate and heart attack, as well as chest pain or breathlessness
 iske alaava, baari upyogkartaaon main pakshaaghaat, daura or sir dard aam he
 Cocaine often reduces food intake, many older users lose appetite and may experience severe malnutrition and weight loss
 iske alaava kokene ke prabhaav main, upyogkarta ke liye vruddhi dekhi jaati he, jab nae parivesh or uttejnaaon ke saath sanyojit rup se istemaal kiya jaataa he, duusare shabdon main nae maahaul main
 Cocaine is extensively metabolized, mainly in the liver, leaving only 1% unchanged in the urine
 upaapachay par, hydrolytic aster clivej kaa prabhutv rahata he, isliye samaapt metabolites zyaadaatar, pramukh metabolite benzoylegonin se milakar banataa he or kam maatra main anya mahatvapurn metabolites se jaise egonin mithail aster or egonin
 aage, kokene ke chote metabolites main shaamil hai norkokene, pi-hydroxicocaine, em-hydroxicocaine, pi-hydroxibenzoylegonin or em-hydroxibenzoylegonin
 inamen, maanav sharir main drug ke maanak upaapachay se pare banaae gaye metabolites shaamil nahin hai, udhaaharan ke liye pirolysis prakriya dwaara, jaisaa kii mithailegonidain ke maamle main
 Depending on liver and kidney function, cocaine metabolites can be detected in urine
 benzoylegonin, kokene seven ke baad chaar ghante ke bheetar mutr main paaya ja saktaa he or 150 ng / ml se adhik kii saghanta main aam taur par kokene seven ke aath dinon baad tak paaya ja saktaa he
 The discovery of a collection of cocaine metabolites in hair is possible in regular users until the hair that has grown during the intake is cut or falls off
 agar sharaab ke saath seven kiya jaae to kokene sharaab ke saath milakar jigar main cocaithalin banaata he
 Studies show that cocaethylene, euphoria and has higher cardiovascular toxicity than cocaine itself
 chuhon par kiye gaye ek adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki mirch spray main paaya jane vaala capsicine kokene ke saath milakar ghaatak parinaam paidaa kar saktaa he
 The method through which they interact is not known
 kokene ek shaktishaalee tantrika tantra uttejk he
 Its effect can last from 15-30 minutes to an hour depending on the method of consumption
 kokene satarkta ko, kushi kii bhaawanaaon or utsaah ko, urja or gatik gatividhi ko, yogyata or kaamuktha kii bhaawanaaon ko badhaata he
 Sports performance can be enhanced
 chintaa, vyamoh or bechaini bhi pai jaati he
 Due to excessive intake, tremors, convulsions and body temperature rise are observed
 kanoonee padaarthon, vishesh rup se sharaab or tambaaku ke upyog se hone vaali swasthya samasyaayein, kokene seven se hone vaali swasthya samasyaon se kahin adhik hai
 Occasional use of cocaine does not usually cause serious or minor physical or social problems
 atyadhik yaa lambey samay tak prayog karte rahane se, yah drug khujali, kshiprahridayata, matibhram or sanvibhram paidaa kar sakati he atyadhik khuraaq ke kaaran hridaygati main tezi or raktchaap main ullekhneey vruddhi hoti he
 This life can be fatal, especially if the user has an existing heart problem
 kokene kaa LD50 jab chuhon ko intraperitonium rup se diya gaya to 95
1 mg / kg he
 Toxicity results in seizures and is followed by respiratory and circulatory depression arising from the cortex
 iske falswaroop shwasan tantra kii vifaltaa, pakshaaghaat, mastishk raktasrav, yaa hriday gati ke ruk jane se maut bhi ho sakati he
 Cocaine is also highly pyrogenic, because stimulation and increased muscle activation produce more heat
 taap haani teevr vahikasankirnan se niyantrit hoti he
 Cocaine-induced hyperthermia can cause muscle cell destruction and induce renal failure by increasing myoglobinuria
 apatkaaleen upachaar ke tahat aksar ek benjodigepine dardanivarak agent diya jaataa he, jaise diazepam, taaki badi hui hriday gati or raktchaap ko kam kiya ja sake
 Body coolness and paracetamol can be used to treat hyperthermia, while specific treatments are developed for other complications
 kokene adhimaatra ke ilaaj ke liye aadhikarik taur par anumodith koi vishisht pratikaarak nahin he or haalanki kokene adhimaatra ke upachaar main kuch dawaaon jaise, dexmedatomadin or rimkazol ko pashuon ke adhyayan main upyogi paaya gaya he, koi aupchaarik maanviya pareekshan nahin kiya gaya he

 Disability is nothing less than a curse for anyone, but Graham Bell did not let the disability become a curse

 Graham Bell was deeply saddened and disappointed by her mother's inability to listen, but never let her disappointment hinder her path to success
