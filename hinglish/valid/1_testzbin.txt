isliye isse sambandhit saare aandolan mukhyatah kavita ke aandolan rahe
 However, the story and other genres too had a substantial impact and in the field of story also, a movement like 'akhani' took shape
 san saath ke aasapaas nayi kavita kii dhara apane se kuch alag hoti dikhne lagi
 The new twist that is targeted after sixty is not a new thing to look at all of a sudden, but only by new poetry
 saath ke baad kii kavita main asantosh, asweekruti or vidroh kaa swar bahut saaf taur par ubhara he
 The tone of dissatisfaction and disapproval is present in the new poem as well, but after sixty this tone has taken the form of more intense satire and rebellion, going too close to the broken idols of life, their brokenness, agony and rejection from it Has recognized the fierceness of nayi kavita kii sabase badi visheshta yahi he ki usne samgr jivan kii pramanik anubhutiyon ko unke jivant parivesh main vyakt kiya
 He understood the significance of the poem only in highlighting every small and big truth of life through symbols and images, by breaking the siege of the subject or cognition of the subject and made of different visions or promises
 lekin kul milakar nayi kavita ke kaviyon main pidaa ke baavjood bhavishya nirmaan ke prati sakaaratmak aashaa bhi bani rahi
 Due to the conditions of post-independence India, there was a lot of frustration and breakdown in them, but there was also a weak hope of fulfilling dreams
 mohabhang yaa disilusenment puure rup main nahin hua tha, isliye nayi kavita main yatnaa-bodh he, asweekruti kaa swar bhi he, kintu vidroh kaa ubhaar nahin he
 Gradually 'illusion' broke down, disillusioned
 vyakti kaa saamaajik parivesh or bhi kurup lagane laga, bhavishya ke sapane tuutate gayi
 In the words of Dr
 Bachchan Singh, there was no light in the sun grown by the poets - the reception of the sun went in vain
 anek sahityakaron ko do hi raste najar aane lage ki yaa to ve nayi kavita ke pradhan swar main swar milakar pidaa kii mukt anubhuti ko or gahanta se vyakt karte athwa ye sari paristhitiyaan unke samvedansheel man ko jhakazorkar or yatnaa ke bich se ubhar kar unhen vidrohi banaati hui sab-kuch asweekaar karne ko prerit karne lageen
 Both these streams remained in the literature, but immediately after the sixties, the rebel stream was predominant, most of which were malevolent or sexually perverse
 nirlakshya hone se ye kavitaayen suvidhaatmak rup se vidroh karne vaali huin yani jahaan vidroh karne main khatra anubhav ho vahaan nahin, jahaan suvidha ho vahaan vidroh hota rahaa
 The first decade of Sathotari Hindi literature is particularly influenced by modernism
 is sandarbh main dhyatavya he ki aadhunik or aadhuniktaa main antar he
 'modern' reports separation from 'medieval'
 'aadhunik' vaigyanik avishkaron or audyogikaran kaa parinaam he jabaki 'aadhuniktaa' audyogikaran kii atishyata, mahanagareey ekresata, do mahayudhon kii vibheeshikaa kaa fal he
 According to Dr
 Bachchan Singh, "modernity" is actually the name of new, non-romantic and non-romantic interviews of heterogeneous human conditions arising as a result of new science and technology
 " Modernist literature is a special kind of literature
 yah sthapit samskruti, mulya or samvednaa ko asweekaar karti he
 It does not accept the beliefs of the world, adopting the tradition as fetters
 aadhuniktaavaadi antaryaatra karata he, mulyon kaa makhul udaata he, vah vidrohi hota he
 Opposes the crowd, is a believer of the person's salvation
 vah apane ko a-maanav kii sthiti main paata he, or sneh, kritagyata aadi ko nishkasit kar detaa he
 Its characteristics or 'motif' are lack of restraint, experimentation, sabotage of literature forms, attitude of giving shock, aspiration for resentment-violence etc
 nayi kavita se vilgau anubhav karte hue kavy-kshetra main jo anek pravritiyaan sakriy raheen, unamem sabase adhik ullekhneey he ginsburg aadi america bitanicon tathaa unase prabhavit bengal ke malay raichaudhuri or subimal basaa jaise bhukhi peedi ke kaviyon ke samanaantar hindi main ubharne vaale raajakmal choudhary tathaa akavita or asweekrut kavita se sambaddh kuch anya kavi jinhone 'hetro sexuality' evam 'open sikresi' kii beet dharanaon ko apanaakar samaaj se apane ko 'disephiliet' karne kaa praytn kiya
 Nude use of sexual terminology in his poetry is often found in the form of rites and mutilation to express his distress and resentment
 raajakmal choudhary ko is dashak kii aguwai karne vaala kavi mana gaya he
 Modernity is seen in its totality in Rajkamal Chaudhary
 is samay kii adhikansh rachanaaon par choudhary kii chhap dekhi ja sakati he
 The Beatnik movement came to Hindi as a fashion and in no time became disinterested because its roots were not in the realities of the country
 vastutah ye gusse ke kavi the
 He kept venting his anger in his angry speech
 purvavarti samast mulyon or paramparaon ko nakaar kar ve apni chikhon, jakhmon or yon-vidrupataaon ko kavita main vyakt karte rahe
 However, the euthanistic, neo-progressive or neo-progressive poets, while emphasizing social values, expressed their disagreement with these beatniks
 nayi kavita ke uparant hindi kavy ke kshetra main thodi si hi avadhi main itane adhik naare sunai diye, itane adhik aandolan aaye ki vishwa ke kisi anya sahitya main itani kam avadhi main itane adhik naare or andolan kabhi nahin utpann hue
 Some of these movements and slogans were buried in the neck of time, but some grew on the path of development
 vastutah in andolanon kii poshak rachanaayen ek-duusare se milti-julati bhi raheen tathaa kabhi-kabhi to ek hi kavi kai andolanon kaa anugami rahaa
 This time of literature was a time of chaotic flood of movements
 mukhyatah kavita-pradhan in andolanon ke naam is prakaar hai- There were many pro-system movements along with anti-system movements in the poetry-movements that came like floods in this decade; But often there was a lack of systematic thinking in all these movements, due to which almost all these proved to be short-lived
 in donon prakaar ke mukhya andolanon kaa saamaanya parichay agrankit sheershakon main drashtavy he
 In the March 1962 issue of 'bharati', Sri Virendrakumar Jain announced the new poem 'sanatan Suryodayi'
 apana mantavya vyakt karte hue unka kahana tha ki " patan-paraajay, kuntha, atmpidana or jivit aatmghaat ke asujh andhkaar main aatmahaara dishaharaa hokar bhatak rahi aaj kii anaath kavy chetana ke sammukh ham-- alp se mahat main le jane vaali, andhkaar se prakaash main le jane vaali, mrityu se amrit main le jane vaali or seemaa main aseem kii lila ko utaar laane vaali-- aagaamee kal kii anivaary sanathan suryodayi nutan kavita dhara kaa dwaar mukt karte hai
 "thus the main tone of this movement was of the system, but only after 3 years, in the February 1965 issue of 'bharati', instead of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita', the tone of 'nutan Kavita' was heard
 gangaaprasad vimal jaise 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke bhootpurv samarthak swayan 'akavita' varg main sammilit ho gayi
 The Yuyotsavist poem is related to a magazine called 'yuyutsa'
 yuyutsavadi kavita ke pravartak shalab shriram singh the
 He has been of the opinion that primitive Yuyutsa is the main inspiration of literature
 unka kahana he ki "main sahityasarjan kii mul prerana ke rup main usee aadim yuyutsa ko sweekaarta hoon jo kahin na kahin prayek kranti, parivartan athwa vighatan ke mul main pramukh rahi he
 It can be anything young, zoological, puerile, platonic or platonic
 " april 1965 kii 'roopambara' main 'prarambh' ke antargat swadesh bhartiya dwaara 'sabakaa ek maatr kaaran yuyutsa' kii ghoshnaa karte hue shalab shriram singh kaa yah uddhran diya gaya tha
 'rupambara' itself appeared in the 'adhyunatan Kavita issue' of August 1966 as a 'yuyotsavist Navlakhan Pradhan co-operative effort', with statements from three poets
 sampadak ne nayi samvedansheeltaa kii baat bhi uthaayi
 Vimal Pandey, Rameshwaradatta Manav, Om Prabhakar, Bajrang Bishnoi etc
 also related themselves to this movement
 vimal pandeya ne 'yuyutsawad' ko 'engri yang main' se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya
 Shri Om Prabhakar considers Yuyutsa as a synonym for Jeejivisha, considering 'wariness' to be an eternal instinct
 bajrang bishnoi ne patibaddhta ke prashn ko yuyutsa se jod diya he
 In the July '66 issue of 'utkarsh' magazine, Shriram Shukla raised the slogan of 'rejected Poetry' and introduced 'long Rejected Poem' titled 'sexual intercourse with dead woman'
 shukla ji ke liye 'sambhog kaa anubhav hi paryaapt he-- saat mahakavy likh le jane ke liye
 The poet of the spokesperson of the rejected poem believes - "the asymmetry of not telling the truth as truth is sometimes broken by breaking the barrier and only then is the birth of the rejected poem
" " tathaa "prastut yug main vyaapt, yatharth hote hue bhi asweekrut vishisht pravritiyon, sanvegon, sthitiyon, mulyon, asangatiyon or mood kii sampreshak kavita he
 "rejected poetry is a poem of sexual perversions
 ashleel shabdon kaa prayog inke liye sahaj sweekrut he tathaa inke anusaar ye 'naapsand vyavasthaaon ko badalane ke liye' vyagr hai
 Even if they cannot present a solution, they consider it their duty to 'draw the attention of the insane people by putting question marks on them'
 'akavita' kaa sutaradhar dow0 shyaam parmaar ko mana gaya he, parantu jagadish chaturvedi bhi unke saath baraabar ke bhagidaar the or 'akavita' ke aarambhik prastaavkon main the
 In fact, there were three editors of 'akvita' magazine - Jagdish Chaturvedi, Shyam Parmar and Rabindranath Tyagi
 'akavita' patrika main akavita ke samarthan main saidhantik lekh praayah nahin chaape jate the
 Those people believed that 'we will not speak'
 parantu, dow0 shyaam parmaar ne akavita ke samarthan main 'akavita or kala-sandarbh' sheershak se baqayada pustak bhi likhi, jisamen bahuvidh akavita ko paribhaashit karne kaa praytn kiya gaya
 Jagdish Chaturvedi calls this poetry as 'abhinav Kavya', due to the awareness of the monotony, inconsistency and sacramental expression of life lived on the intellectual level by the poets of this class and separation from the ancient tradition of poetry
 Are that "they can be enumerated as meaningful carriers of 'anti-poetry'"
 " parantu shyaam parmaar akavita ko anti kavita yaa kavita virdohi nahin maanate
 They consider Akavita to be an 'investigative poem of contradictions'
 unke anusaar is kavyandolan kii visheshta is tathy main he ki "kaviyon kii pravritiyaan alag-alag manahosthitiyon se judi hai
 "" Akavita is a tenacious poem
 vah simit samay kii kavita hogi, kyonki use bhavishya main jhande nahin gaadna hoga
 Many levels of expression are possible in "and" avaita
 bhashaa or kathy main vah patibaddh nahin he, isliye 'flexbal' he
 It has complex and 'tipsy' processes - straight and broken things
 " akavita ke pravaktaa kavi ne yah bhi ullekh kiya he ki "akavita ke liye nayi kavita yaa navagit virodh yogya nahin hai
 People of the movement instinctively call it a faction or conspiracy
 " Akvita's movement was also accused of being associated with the Beatnik movement
 parantu, iske prastaavkon jagadish chaturvedi evam shyaam parmaar ne bitanicon ke vyavhaar ko spashtatah nindaneey bataaya tathaa usase 'akavita' ke judaav se bilkul inkaar kiya
 The names of Girijakumar Mathur, Prabhakar Machwe, Bharat Bhushan Aggarwal, Vimal and Atul etc
 were also found in the proposers of 'akvita' magazine, which originated from 1965 to 67
 is sandarbh main saumitr mohan tathaa mudrarakshas kii rachanaayen bhi ullekhneey hai
 Dr
 Prabhakar Machwe due to American Beatnik influence, Rajkamal Chaudhary due to Bangla influence and Trilochan and Shamsher Bahadur Singh due to Ginsberg influence also associated themselves with beat poetry
 'kriti' or 'abhivyakti' naamak patrikaon main machave ji ne apni dharna ko ghoshit bhi kiya
 Poets of 'rebel generation' published from Allahabad also showed this effect indirectly
 'taaji kavita' ke pravartak lakshmikant verma the
 Verma ji was one of the great supporters of the first 'new poem'
 unhone nayi kavita ke saidhantik vishleshan se sambandhit pehali mahatvapurn pustak likhi thi 'nayi kavita ke pratimaan'
 However, later on changing the recognition, he became the promoter of 'fresh poetry'
 unhone 'taaji kavita' kaa andolan isliye chalaaya ki nayi kavita main ab kuch 'nayaapan' bhi shesh na rah gaya tha or vah ek khaas rup main pratishthit bhi ho chuki thi
 Varma ji also said that "much of the new poem was indirectly taken up by Naibhinal taking the vitality from the shadows
 " haalaanki 'taji kavita' kaa yah andolan bhi aage chal nahin sakaa
 Not even a single poet or writer who accompanied Verma ji appeared until July 1965 and "without any noise, 'fresh poetry' was buried in its own right
 " The name of Dr
 Parmanand Shrivastava is associated with committed poetry
 dow0 shrivastav kii dharna he : "main maanata hoon ki kavita ke saamne iske sivaay doosraa vikalp nahin he ki vah aaj kii sampurna manavniyati kaa saakshaatkaar kare or poonjeewaadi vyavastha dwaara prerit amanavikaran ke viruddh sangharsh kare
 "and" language is an important tool in the realm of committed poetry - the above struggle
 " dow0 shrivastav ne sangharsh ke swaroop ko bhi aage paribhaashit kiya he-- "patibaddh kavita main sangharsh sidhaa or sarthak shabd he-- uskaa koi chhadmavesh nahin he-- jo log kisi kism kii patibaddhta ko sweekaar nahin karte ve jhootha sangharsh rachate hai or us main majaa lete hai
 Thus, this movement was a system of movement away from modernism or anarchy and was a form of Marxism
 iske peeche ek vichaardhaara, ek raajnneetik drushti thi
 Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar, the narrator of Sahaja poetry, has been considered
 is andolan kaa bhi aadhuniktawaad yaa araajaktaa se dur dur tak koi sambandh nahin tha
 Its supporters included Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Acharya Nandadulare Vajpayee, Agnayya, Dinkar, Dr
 Nagendra, Dr
 Devaraj, Dr
 Indranath Madan, Dr
 Prabhakar Machve and Ramdarash Mishra
 dow0 shyaam parmaar tathaa raajakmal choudhary ne bhi ise samarthan diya tha
 In March 1967, the release of Sahaj Kavita was published
 vijyapti ke kuch ansh is prakaar hai-- "san '60 ke baad ek varg main manarism kaa croftmanship ko hi mul lakshya mana or hindi kavita kul milakar tedi rekhaon ke vyapaar ke rup main saamne aayi
 That is why it has been fashion and not very meaningful

 Dr
 Parmanand Srivastava, Rajendra Prasad Singh, Dr
 Kumar Vimal, Shrikant Joshi, Dr
 Shyamsunder Ghosh, Dr
 Vishwambharanath Upadhyay, Dr
 Ganapatichandra Gupta and Shivapratap Singh supported Sahaja Kavita in their articles of collection called 'sahaja Kavita' published in 1968 AD
 dow0 rabindra bhramar ne apane lekh main sahaj kavita ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya-- "prastut sandarbh main 'sahaj' shabd kaa vyutpattimulk arth lenaa hoga 'sah jaayate iti sahajah
 'that is, the creation which takes birth in the tangible medium of speech with true sensation momentum, it is easy
 is drushti se anubhuti kii pramanikta praathmik vastu he
 If the feeling is direct and authentic, then the expression will be unnatural and uncomplicated
 " tathaa "sahaj kii maang vyashtimulak hote hue bhi samajasaapeksh he
 "dr
 Bhramar has also associated the question of commitment with Sahaja poetry:" Sahaja poetry is fully committed to the life and creative responsibility of his era
 uske mul main sahaj sampurna jivan kii pratiti or sahaj sugathit shilp ke madhyam kii khoj kaa ek eemaandaar praytn nihit he
 " navagit kaa naam farvari 1958 main mujffarpur se prakashit 'gitangini' naamak patrika main dikhaai diya
 Some new songs were also compiled in this magazine
 kuch lekhak navagit kaa vikaas nayi kavita ke hi samanaantar maanate hai or use nayi kavita kii ek vishesh style maanate hai

 dhruvit prakaash tathaa prakaashat: sakriyata kii khoj ke uparaant vinyasarsayan ke siddhanton main ullekhneey pragati paister ke dwaara hui
 Paster discovered that the composition of tartaric and racemic acids and their structure is HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH, but their physical properties differ
 racemic amla, tarterik amla kii apeksha pani main kam viley he tathaa tarterik amla or uske lavan prakaashat: sakriy hai, par racemic amla or uske lavan prakaashat: niskriy hai
 Paster's most famous discovery was on sodium and ammonium salts of racemic acid
 yah lavan jab jal se 22 degree par crystalikrut hota he, to iske cristan duusare recemet se bhinn hote hai or inaki ardhafalakeey falikaay hoti hai
 Two types of crystals are obtained, one is southward like sodium ammonium tartrate and the other is crystals whose opposite properties are opposite
 is duusare prakaar ke crystal ko darpan pratibimb kii sangya di gai
 When they were separated from the mixture, its aqueous solution was counterclockwise
 isse praapt amla kaa crystal bhi tarterik amla ke crystal ke darpan pratibimb ke rup main tha or vilyan bhi vamavart tha
 Therefore, this acid was considered as another form of tartaric acid
 inke crystal asamamit hote hai : It was found that only those crystals and molecules, whose mirror images are not imputed, are lightly activated
 aisi sanrachana ko asamamit kehete hai
 Many substances are lightly activated only in solid state, such as crystalline, sodium chlorate, etc
 sarvapratham gyaat, prakaashat: sakriy padaarth sphatik hi he, jiske crystal do prakaar ke, ek dakshinvart or doosraa vamavart, hote hai
 These two crystals are mirror reflections of each other and do not impose
 crystal ke aise jodon ko pratibimb rup kehete hai
 Its activation disappears when the crystal is smelted
 isliye sphatik kii prakaashat: sakriyata uske asamamit crystal sanrachana ke kaaran hoti he
 Substances of this class remain lightly active only as long as they are in solid form and their activity is destroyed by melting, evaporation and in solution
 bahut se yogic thos, galan, gasiy yaa vilyan avasthaa main bhi prakaashat: sakriy hote hai, jaise glucose, tarterik amla aadi
 Their activation is due to the unmatched molecular structure of the compound
 is anu or uske darpan pratibimb ko pratibimb rup, prakaashiya prativinyasi yaa prakaashiya samaavyavi kehete hai
 Except for only two things, these forms result from one of the physical properties
 ek hi dhruvit prakaash ke saath baraabar or vipareet ghurnan dete hai or duusare dakshinavart tathaa vamavart vrittiya dhruvit prakaash ke saath inkaa avasorana gunank bhinn hota he
 The chemical properties of reflection forms are the same, but there is often a difference in the reaction with another optically active substance
 sharirkriyaatmak sakriyata main bhi antar ho saktaa he, jaise histydin meetha hota he or histydin swadaheen; nicotine nicotine se adhik vishaiylla hota he
 In 1874, Vant Hoff and Le Bal resolved the existence of the apparently isomerism of organic compounds
 waant half ne vichaar kiya ki carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaa kisi samachatushfalak ke chaaron siron kii taraf nirdeshit he or carbon parmaanu us chatushfalak ke madhya main sthit he
 According to this theory, the four hydrogen atoms of methane will be the same, which has also been proved by physical and chemical reactions
 iske purv 1858 i
 main yah samajha jaataa tha ki carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaayen ek samtal main hai or carbon parmaanu is varg ke centre par he
 The four valencies of carbon in the CX4 molecule are the same and it is conceivable that they have a symmetric configuration in the stereoscope
 is prakaar teen vyavastha sambhav ho sakati he - taleey, piramidia or chatushfalkeey
 If the molecule is unilateral, three forms of the compound c abde may be possible
 yadi anu piramidy he, to is yogic ke chah rup sambhav ho sakate hai
 If the molecule is tetrahedral, only two forms of compound c abde will be possible and both will be mirror reflections of each other
 vastav main yogic c a b d e ek jode pratibimb rup main hi praapt hote hai, jo chatushfalkeey anusanrachana kii pushti karte hai
 When all four groups in carbon are different, then such carbon is called asymmetric carbon
 prakaashat: sakriy carbonic yogicon main ek, athwa ek se adhik, asamamit carbon parmaanu avashya rahete hai
 When both the c abde forms of the asymmetric carbon compound change to Ca2 bd, only one optically inactive substance is obtained, such that both the lactic acid clockwise and counterclockwise give the same propionic acid
 isse chatushfalkeey carbon kii pushti hoti he
 Crystalline analysis of the Runtgen ray, dipole base, absorption spectrum and electron diffraction studies also confirm the tetrahedral nature of carbon
 ganitiya gananaa ke dwaara carbon kii kisi do sanyojaktaa ke bich kaa kone 109 degree 28minute nikaala gaya
 It was previously thought that this valence angle is constant, but it is now known that valence may deviate from its location and this angle can also change
 jab carbon parmaanu se sanyojit sabhi chaaron parmaanu yaa samooh ek se hote hai, to yah kone nishchay hi 109 degree 28 minute hota he, jaisaa methen, CH4, yaa carbon tetracloride, ccl4, main he
 But in methylene chloride CH2 Cl2, the angle is found to be 112 degrees, because greater dispersion in the valence angle is possible due to the repulsive force of large atoms of chlorine
 ek asamamit carbon parmanuwale samaavyaviyon main mukhya antar unki prakaashiya sakriyata main he
 The only difference is in the sign of rotation of both reflection forms
 isliye inhen prakaashat: prativinyasi bhi kehete hai
 The molecule of lactic acid, CH3
CHOH
COOH, has only two optically active isomers, which are mirror mirrors of each other
 inhen dectro - or livo - lactic amla kehete hai
 In equal proportions, the mixture of the two forms is lightly inert, because the rotation of the two reflection forms is the same and the direction is opposite
 aise anu anupaati mishran, jo bahyat: pratikaarit tathaa prakaashat: niskriy hote hai, racemic roopaantar kehalaate hai
 Such racemic compounds are directed by r or dl-prefixes
 is prakaar ek asamamit carbon parmaanu vaala yogic teen roopon main praapt ho saktaa he
 The probability of these isomers is dependent on the asymmetric carbon atom
 carbon kii asamamitati nasht hone par prakaashiya sakriyata tathaa samavyawata donon lupt ho jaati hai
 Decomposition of both forms of activated malic acid gives inactive succinic acid, HOOC
CH2
CH2
COOH
 yogicon main jyon-jyon asamamit carbon parmaanuon kii sankhya badhati jaati he tyon-tyon adhik samaavyavi roopon kii sambhaavna badhati jaati he
 In the normal case of an asymmetric compound consisting of the number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the number of optically active isomers can be 2n and 2n-1 will be pairs of reflection forms f, ie 2n racemic forms
 ve yogic, jinamein do bhinn asamamit carbon parmaanu hon 2 x 2 arthath chaar roopon kii kshamta rakhte hai
 These will have two pairs and each pair will have the same and opposite sign rotations
 donon jodon se do racemic rup bhi praapt honge
 Examples of this type are the cinematic acid dibromide, C6H5
 CH Br
 chbr
 COOH is obtainable in four optically active forms and two racemic forms
 yogic, jinamein donon samaan asamamit carbon parmaanu hon, teen vinyason main paae jate hai, jinamein do prakaashat: sakriy pratibimb rup hote hai or teesraa ant:pratikaarit niskriy hota he or inkaa vibhedan prakaashat: sakriy roopon main nahin ho saktaa
 Apart from these, a racemic form also arises from both active forms
 sankhya 3
 dwaara nideshit padaarth prakaashat: niskriy hota he
 Although it has two active carbons, they neutralize each other, as their rotation is the same and opposite
 is ant:pratikaarit anu ko i athwa meso rup kehete hai
 Inactive and undifferentiated forms are not possible in compounds that have the same asymmetric carbon atom
 yah racemic roopon se bhinn hota he, jinka vibhedan unke prakaashat: sakriy roopon main kiya ja saktaa he
 The best example of this type is dihydroxycinic acid, which has two identical asymmetric carbons and which historically has great value
 siddhant ke anusaar yah dakshinvart, vamavart or meso-tartirik amla roopon ke samaan mishran se praapt hota he
 The southward and counterclockwise are optically transient and the meso and racemic are passive
 inke sanrachanasutra nimna rup se darshaae ja sakate hai : An equivalent mixture of a pair of models is called a racemic form
 yah rup nimna kaarnon se praapt ho saktaa he : By mixing both models in equal amounts
 asamamit yogicon ke sanshleshan main racemic rup praapt hota he
 The process of converting a lightly active compound into a racemic form is called respiration
 praaia: yogicon ke + or - roopon kaa rapeemikaran taap, prakaash or rasinic abhikarmakon ke prabhaav se ho saktaa he
 The action of transformation depends on the compound and the reagents
 kuch yogicon kaa rapeemikaran itani saralata or shighrata se hota he ki unako prakaashat: sakriy rup main nahin praapt kiya ja saktaa
 There are some compounds that are not mixed
 vibhedan yah kriya he jisase racemic roopantaran se uske donon pratibimb rup alag kiye jate hai
 In fact, their quantitative separation is very rare and in some there is only one model
 vibhedan kii kuch vidhiyaan is prakaar hai : Mechanical separation - Paster discovered the method by which the crystals of both models are different and can be separated by hand
 paister ne sodium ammonium tarteret ko 28 degree sein
 par crystalikrut kar, donon prakaar ke crystalon ko chimate se alag alag kiya tha
 The use of this method is very limited
 niveshan dwaara varnatmak crystalan - racemic mishran ke atisantrupt vilyan main jab ek pratibimb rup kaa ek crystal daalaa jaataa he, to pehle usee pratibimb rup kaa crystal hota he or is prakaar us rup kaa pruthakkaran ho saktaa he
 Biochemical resolution - When some bacteria or mold grow on a dilute solution of a racemic, they destroy one image form more quickly than the other
 is prakaar kisi nirdisht samay ke uparaant ek pratibimb rup kii prapti ho sakati he
 Penicillium glaucum, when grown on a solution of racemic ammonium tartrate, destroys the first dextro form and the levo survives
 rasinic vibhedan - yah vidhi sabase uttam he
 In this, the reflection forms of the racemic compound are treated with a lightly active compound, so that they combine together to form compounds that can be easily separated
 racemic amlon ko prakaashat: sakriy ksharak ke saath upachaarit karne se jo lavan banenge, unamem kuch lavan +amla tathaa +ksharak ke honge or kuch lavan - amla tathaa +ksharak ke honge
 Their properties may vary, from which they can be separated by crystallization
 varanatmak avasorana - prakaashat: sakriy padaarthon kaa varanatmak avasorana kisi vishesh prakaashat: sakriy avasorak dwaara ho saktaa he
 Many chemists have done the differentiation by this
 pehle dakshinavart or vamavart pratibimb roopon ko kramash: dactro or livo upsargon se nirdeshit kiya jaataa tha
 Similarly, it was called factory tartaric and levo tartaric acid
 waantahof ne + or - chinhon kaa prayog asamamit carbon ke vinyas ko darshane ke liye kiya he
 Fisher later proposed that the prefixes d and l be used for their configuration position and not to be used for the direction of rotation
 kisi prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke ghurnan kaa chinh praaia: praayogic dasha main parivartan se vipareet ho saktaa he or isi bhaanti unke sanjaton kaa, jinka vinyas usee prakaar he, chinh bhi ghurnan kii disha se vipareet ho saktaa he, jaise vamavart lactic amla ke lavan or aster dakshinavart hote hai or dakshinavart lactic amla ke vamavart
 For all these reasons, it was considered that for lightly active matter such a mark should be used which directly indicates the position of the configuration and this mark is independent of its mark of rotation direction
 glissraldihide, jisamen ek asamamit carbon parmaanu he, do pratibimb roopon main prapya he or ek swaichh nishchay ke anusaar dakshinavart rup ko aise darshaate hai ki hydraxil, -OH, samooh kaa carbon daahine or hydrogen parmaanu vaain taraf hota he
 According to the arrangement of tetrahedral carbon, the hydrogen and hydroxyl groups are above the surface of the surface and the -CHO and -CH2OH groups are below the surface of the surface
 glissraldihide ke is vinyas ko d kehete hai
 According to popular practice, the group connected by a horizontal line is above the surface of the page
 is bhanti iske pratibimb kii dasha kaa sanket hai
 The configurations related to the authentic configuration of this D-glyceraldehyde fall under the D-class, ie compounds that can be derived from D-glyceraldehyde, or can be converted to D-glyceraldehyde by chemical reaction, into the D-range
 Come
 is tarah glissraldihide kaa puraa naam d glissraldihide or l glissraldihide hota he
 And indicate its rotation direction
 inke eldihide samooh ko agle sajaateey - CHOH - CHO main badla ja saktaa he or jaise ki isamen ek asamamit carbon he vaise hi har glissraldyhide do rup denge
 In carbon compounds, when one group is replaced by another group, it is understood that the substituent replaces the removed group
 yadi ek prakaashat: sakriy yogic a saadhaaran pratisthaapan abhikriya se ba yogic main parivartit hota he, to inke vinyas ek se hote hai
 This is true, but sometimes the configuration changes as well as replacement
 is vinyas parivartan ko prakashkeey pratilomon, yaa avishkaarak wolden ke naam se walden pratilomon kehete hai
 a simple example of this is the substitution of chlorine in chloroxynic acid from the hydroxyl group, malic acid is obtained and southward acid is obtained using potassium hydroxide

 The year of 1204 BCE or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus

 Rahim has chosen for example in poetry the scripts of texts like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana and Gita and has tried to explain the temporal life behavior aspect by him, which offers a glimpse of Indian culture
 abdurrarahim khaankhaana kaa janm sanwat 1613 i

 As a royal dynasty, Rahim was given the title of 'mirza Khan'
 rahim ne baba jambur kii dekh-rekh main gahan adhyayan kiya
 At the end of education, Akbar got Rahim married to his daughter's daughter Mahabano
 iske baad rahim ne gujarat, kumbhalaner, udaipur aadi yudhon main vijay praapt kii
 On this, Akbar honored Rahim with the highest title of his time, 'mirarj'

 Humayun chose Bairam Khan for the education of Crown Prince Akbar and appointed Akbar's guardian in the last days of his life, giving him the responsibility of managing the state
 bairam khan ne kushal niti se akbar ke rajya ko majboot banane main puraa sahyog diya
 For some reason there was a difference of opinion between Bairam Khan and Akbar
 akbar ne bairam khan ke vidroh ko safaltaapurvak dabaa diya or apane ustad kii maan evam laaj rakhte hue use haj par jane kii ichha jataai
 As a result, Bairam Khan left for Haj
 bairam khan haj ke liye jate hue gujarat ke patan main tehre or patan ke prasiddh sahasraling sarovar main nauka-vihaar ke baad tat par baithe the ki bhent karne kii niyat se ek afgaan sardaar mubarak khan aayaa or dhokhe se bairam khan kii hatya kar di
 Mubarak Khan did this to avenge his father's death

 Not only did these fraudsters commit murder, but they also caused a lot of looting
 vidhwaa sultanaa begum apane kuch sevakon sahit bachakar ahmedabad aa gai
 As soon as Akbar came to know about the incident, he sent a message to Sultana Begum to return to the court
 raste main sandesh paakar begum akbar ke darbar main aa gai
 At such a time, Akbar, giving proof of his greatness, gave shelter to him with great generosity and said to Rahim, "keep it happy in all ways
" ise yah pataa na chale ki inke pita khan khaanaan kaa saaya sar se uth gaya he
 Baba said to Jambur that this is our son
 ise hamaari drushti ke saamne rakhaa karo
 In this way, Akbar raised Rahim just like a son of religion
 kuch dinon ke pashchaat akbar ne vidhwaa sultanaa begum se vivaah kar liya
 Akbar honored Rahim with the title of "mirza Khan" as per the royal family
 rahim kii shiksha- diksha akbar kii udaar dharm- nirpeksh niti ke anukool hui
 Due to this education, the poetry of Rahim remains a thunderous neck of the Hindus even today
 dinakar ji ke kathananusaar akbar ne apane deen-ilaahi main hindootv ko jo sthaan diya hoga, usase kai guna zyada sthaan rahim ne apni kavitaaon main diya
 It is said about Rahim that he was a Muslim by religion and a pure Indian by culture
 rahim kii shiksha samaapt hone ke pashchaat samraat akbar ne apane pita humayun kii parampara kaa nirvaah karte hue, rahim kaa vivaah bairam khan ke virdohi mirza ajij coca kii bahan mahabaanon se karvaa diya
 In this marriage too, Akbar did the same, which had been doing before that due to the relationship of marriage, mutual tension and old bitterness was ended
 rahim ke vivaah se bairam khan or mirza ke bich chali aa rahi puraani ranjish khatm ho gayi
 Rahim was married at the age of about sixteen

 lekin sanders ise sire se khaarij karte hai, kyonki vah harmis ke sadsy kisi jokhim main nahin daal sakate, lekin henderson gupachup rup se yah jaankaree harmis tak bhej dete hai
