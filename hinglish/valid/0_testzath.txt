 The family listens to a tape given by Jahnavi in which she confesses her love
 raaj se shaadi karne ke prayaas main, jahnavi shahar ke ganesh mandir ke andar laalchee kaajal se milti he
 She offers two crore rupees in exchange for Raj's marriage

 The bungalow she buys turns out to be Nisha's
 tab kaajal ne use taana maar ke kaha ki usne apane sapanom ko puraa kar liya he, jabaki nisha ke sapane ab sabakuch khone ke baad tut gaye hai

 ab kaajal ko pataa chalata he ki vah apane parivaar se kitni dur chali gai he
 She forgets her wedding anniversary and holds a birthday party for her daughter's birthday, without realizing that Raj has never been attracted to the lavish lifestyle and thus pushing her towards Jahnavi
 kaajal sudharne kii koshish karti he
 When nothing works, Kajal slaps Jahnavi and accuses her of stealing her husband
 tab vah jahnavi ko ghar se baahar phenkane kii koshish karti he, lekin iskaa koi phayda nahin hua, kyonki raaj ne jahnavi ke saath jane kaa faisla kiya
 The children also decide to live with Jahnavi and his father
 duusari ore kaajal, apane parivaar ko chhodkar chale jane se vyakul ho jaati he
 She donates all her money
 jab vah jaanati he ki raaj or bachche america ja rahe hai, to vah hawaii adde par jaati he
 She finds them ready to go
 lekin aakhri minute main, jahnavi raaj ko bataaya ki vah akele america ke liye ja rahi he, lekin vah sachmuch akeli nahin he
 She is expecting Raj's child
 jahnavi sweekaar karti he ki yadhyapi kaajal ne apane pati ko bech diya tha, lekin vah hi thi jisane use kharidne kii peshkash kii or is tarah use bhi apni dendariyon kaa bhugtan karnaa chahie
 So, the film ends with Kajal coming back to her family and Jahnavi moving to New York forever

 a good advertisement should have the following qualities / features: - kisi bhi vigyaapan kii sabase badi visheshta yah hoti he ki vah logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kare
 The presentation, language and location of the advertisement should be such that people must have an eye on it
 aisa na hone par vah apane uddeshy main safal nahin ho paaegaa
 Be it advertisements published in magazines or magazines or presented through hoardings etc
, its decoration should be so original that it automatically draws the eyes of the people towards it
 saamaanya se alag kuch vishesh aakarshan hona vigyaapan kii shartan he
 The main feature of the product or item being advertised should be in the advertisement, so that there is no hindrance in establishing a perception among the people
 mukhya baaten yaa kendriya bindu ko aadhaar banaakar vigyaapan aadhik tarksangat tathaa prabhavi banaaya ja saktaa he
 The agency that makes the advertisement should create an advertisement that is literate for all, educated and illiterate, urban and rural
 jis vigyaapan ko samajhane main darshak ko dimag lagaana padegaa uske prati vah judaav mahasoos nahin kar paaegaa
 In such a situation when people will not understand it, how will we move towards using the product? vigyapandaata ko chahie ki vah jis utpaada ko vigyaapit karnaa chahta he usase jude tamaam tathyon ko kramvaar prastut kare
 In fact, the need to create an advertisement was realized only because it is not attracted to anyone who does not need it
 tathyon kii tarkpurna prastuti se log vigyaapan ke prati khulaapan mahasoos karte hai
 The ad must have the quality to speed up the thinking of the viewer or the reader even when it is stationary
 iske liye usamen gatyaatmak sanket hone aavashyak hai, jisase vigyaapan jahaan samaapt ho, dekhne vaala uske aage ko sochakar uske upyog ke liye apana man banaae
 The ad title should be attractive

 Product information is given in the shortest possible time through advertisement
 logon ke vyast samay main se ek kshan churaakar vigyaapan ko unke saamne pradarshit kiya jaataa he

 isliye yah aavashyak he ki utpaada kaa upyog karne waalon tathaa vigyaapan dekhne vaale donon kii ruchi kaa khyaal rakhaa jaay
 Today, technological development has brought people from all over the world closer to each other
 duriyon kaa koi matlab nahin rah gaya he
 All these reasons have made man more ambitious
 vartmaan samay ke bazaar pradhan samaaj main upabhoktavaadi samskruti kaa bolbalaa bad rahaa he
 In such a situation, the task of establishing a relationship between the consumer, society and production is advertising
 utpaadak ke laabh se upabhokta kii iccha kii purti tathaa utpaadit vastu ke upyog kaa maarg prashast karne kaa kaary vigyaapan ko pahchaan pradaan karata he
 In such a situation, the importance of advertising is well known
 vigyaapan ke mahatv ko rekhaankit karte hue britane ke purv pradhanmantri wiliam gledstone ne kabhi kaha tha - vyavsaay main vigyaapan kaa vahi mahatv he jo udyogkshetra main bashpashakti ke avishkaar kaa
 Wiston Churchill countered the importance of its economic utility - no one can produce money without advertising except for mint
 vigyaapan ke mahatv ko ham nimnlikhit rap main prastut kar sakate he- New items are produced through industries and information about these new products is given through advertisement
 saamaanya rap se upabhokta athwa janata paramparik rap se jis vastu kaa upyog karti aayi he use chhodkar nayi vastu ke prati usamen andeh bana rahata he
 Through advertising, interest is generated in the consumer towards the new product produced
 keval vastu hi nahin, utpaadankarta, vastu kii upyogita tathaa uske gunon kii jaankaree dene kaa kaarybhi vigyaapan karata he
 In this way, the consumer has the option of comparing similar items, differentiating their prices, etc
 through advertising and he selects and uses his convenience to buy it
 vigyaapan se keval upabhokta kaa hi laabh nahin praapt hota balki use bechney vaale dukandaar arthath vikreta ko bhi laabh praapt hota he
 The ad seller makes the task so easy that he does not have to repeatedly tell the consumers about the new item
 sachai to yah he ki vigyaapan vastu ke saath hi saath vah kahan-kahan uplabdh he, isaki jaankaree muhaiyaa karaata he
 Hence, both consumers and sellers benefit from advertising
 vigyaapan ke madhyam se nayi vastua ke utpaadan tathaa uski upyogita kii jaankaree di jaati he jisase upabhokta kaa dhyaan us vastu ke istemaal kii ore kendrit hota he
 This is how advertising creates the market
 aaj ham dekhte he ki kal tak jahaan pahunchnaa durgam mana jaataa tha vahaan bhi logon kii bheed pahunch gai he
 People have been making markets at their place of residence
 pehle log kisi vishesh din samay nikaalkar bazaar jate the, ab bazaar swayan unke paas aa gaya he
 All this has been possible due to advertising
 vigyaapan kaa yogadan rashtraseva ke liye bhi kam nahin he
 By making people aware towards production, advertising provides special support in the development of the country's economy

 People can understand education and development of women well through advertisements like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Women Empowerment etc
 vigyaapan kaa kshetra puri tarah se vyavsaayik he
 Its work and utility is related to commercial profit only
 hindi bharat main sabase zyada logon dwaara boli tathaa samajhane vaali bhashaa he
 In this sense, Hindi is the most important language in the medium of advertisement
 vigyaapan ke vishay athwa utpaadit vastua ke gun tathaa uski prastuti ke aadhaar par uski aantarik evam bahi aavashyakta ke anurap bhashaa kii zarurat hoti he
 Today Hindi is taking a new look according to the requirement of advertisement
 vigyaapan ke anusaar hindi bhashaa main nit-naye prayog ho rahe he
 Due to this, language is developing and Hindi is becoming a living language of new times and society, not just the language of books
 prayek bhashaa kii apni bhashaa samskruti hoti he
 His vocabulary, syntax, idioms etc
 are special
 hindi kaa bhi apana bhashaa sanskaar he
 In the present form of advertising, the status of renunciation of traditionalism and acceptance of modernity can be seen
 usamen keval utpaadak, utpaadit vastu or upabhokta hi nahin aata, balki jansanchaar ke sabhi madhyam or yatayat ke saadhan bhi aate hai, ye sabhi vigyaapan ke prasar main sahaayak hote he
 The use of Hindi verbs creates the ability to say more in advertisements
 bikaoo he, jararat he, chaahate ho, aate hai, jate hai, aaie jaise shabdon ke prayog se vigyapanon kii arthvatta badhati he
 The Hindi-vocabulary used in printed advertisements such as letters and magazines changes with the change of medium
 radiyon main jahaan dhvanyatmak shabdon kaa mahatv hota he vahiin televijan tathaa cinema main drishyaatmak kriyaapadon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, if an advertisement like 'apply Boroline' is printed to keep the skin soft on frosty days, then for radio - words like 'remove frosty sweetness Boroline', but Doordarshan and audio-visual
 Visuals in mediums such as' Have you seen? Did you know? Etc
 words are used
 vigyaapan ko aarthik vikaas ke liye dekha ja saktaa he, kai log vigyapanon ke saamaajik lagat par bhi dhyaan dena chaahate he
 Internet advertising is the prime example of this criticism
 internet vigyapanon spem jaise roopon main aakar computer ko kshati karte he
 Exploits the desires of a consumer by making the ads more attractive
 janata ke hit kii raksha ke prayaason kaa dhyaan dene ke liye vigyapanon kaa viniman kii gai he
 Example: The Swedish government banned tobacco advertisements on television in 1991

 Signs and symbols displayed between consumers and the market are encoded in everyday objects

 We use semiotics to study and interpret messages

 us samooh kii ruchi, aadaton evam mahatvakankshaon ko lakshya karke hi vigyaapan kii bhashaa, chitra evam akhbaar, patrikaon, sampreshan madhyamon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa he
 For example - if an entrepreneur prepares an item for women, then his style will be determined on the basis of: upabhokta samooh - mahilaayein Economic - Medium / Low / High shaikshik str - saadhaaran / ucch i do not use any such cream for my saloni skin

 The artistry and creativity of advertising lies in the fact that it tries to look at situations from a new perspective

 The importance of these reagents is evident from the fact that in the first eight years of research, more than 800 research articles were published on them and in 1912, Victor Greenyard was awarded the Nobel Prize in view of the importance of the subject

 The following year, in 1900, his student Greenyard drew the attention of chemists to the many possibilities of this exploration and demonstrated that in the presence of dry ether, magnesium merges into a number of organic halogen compounds to form a new class of compounds

 Formation of the Grignard reagent had completed
 a small amount of magnesium still remained in the flask
 The Grignard reagent thus prepared was cooled to 0°C before the addition of carbonyl compound
 The solution became cloudy since the Grignard reagent precipitated out
 a solution of carbonyl compound was added to the Grignard reagent
 The solution was warmed to room temperature

 According to Sports Illustrated, Rossi is one of the highest earners in the world's sporting personalities, earning an estimated $ 34 million in 2007
 apane pita gragiano rosi ke nakshe kadam par, rosi ne 125cc ke varg main 1996 main aprilia ke liye grand pricks se racing shuru kiya
 Subsequently, he advanced to the 250cc category with Aprilia and in 1999 he won the 250cc World Championships
 In 2001, he won the 500cc World Championship with Honda, the motogp World Championship in 2002 and 2003, and joined Honda and Yamaha before retaining the 2008 and 2009 titles, retaining his win one after the 2004 round

 Valentino Rossi was born in Urbino, then his family moved to Tavulia

 Rossi's first love in racing was go-karts
 apane bete kii suraksha ko lekar chintit maa steffainia ke bhadakaane par gragiano ne bike ke vikalp ke taur par go-cart kharid diya
 chunki zyada teji se aage badhane rosi parivaar kii chaah thi, isliye ve ridizin ke liye tatpar kiya; us samay apane 5 saal ke bete ke liye gragiano ne 60 sisi ke motor kii jagah 100cc rashtriya cart motor lagaaya
 In 1990 Rossi won the regional cart championship
 He then took Minimoto and before the end of 1991 he won several regional races
 rosi ne cart res jari rakhaa or parma main rashtriya cart pratiyogitaaon main unhone paanchvaan sthaan paaya
 Both Valentino and Graziano started thinking about joining the Italian 100cc series as well as the corresponding European series, which would have likely pushed them to Formula One
 However, due to the high cost of racing carts, he decided to participate fully in the minimoto race
 During 1992 and 1993, Valentino continued to learn the interior and exterior aspects of Minimito racing
 1993 main apane pita kii madad se unhone virginio faraari, claudeo costiglioni or claudeo lucwardi kii cagiva milto 125cc motorcycle chalaayi, jise unhone pit len se sau meter se bhi kam duuri tak jaakar pehle-corner krash main nuksaan pahunchaaya

 In 1994, Aprilia by Sandroni used Rossi to improve the RS125R and in turn allowed him to learn how to handle 125cc racing speed
 He initially ran Sandroni at the 1994 Italian Championships and continued in the 1995 European and Italian Championships

 In 2000 Rossi was allowed to run Honda as the prize for his 250cc World Championship, which was the last category of the 500cc Motorcycle Racing World Championship in those days

 This was the first time Rossi would race against another Italian racer, Max Biaggi, who often compared him to the racing press
 This would have been the ninth race before Rossi's win over Honda, but he made a strong start to the second season, finishing second to American Kenny Robertus Jr
 as in the 125 and 250 seasons

 Many observers believe that 2003 was a great time for Australian GP Rossi's career at Phillip Island due to unique circumstances

 The speculation market was hot during the second half of the 2003 season over Rossi's future plan
 kuch logon ko shaq tha ki lagaataar tisare saal apane khitaab ko barkaraar rakhane main shaayad hi ve safal hon or bhavishya main unki sthiti ko lekar andeh jaahir kiya
 His contract with Honda expired at the end of this year and rumors were rumored that Rossi had become somewhat disenchanted with Honda
 honda ke saath unka kaarykaal prabhavi tareeke se chalata rahaa; unhen honda ke saath 500cc vishwa championships ke saath lagaataar aglaa motogp vishwa championships bhi mila
 With participation aroused suspicion that RC211V was dominated by Rossi in their success, with Honda and Rossi becoming inevitable

 2004 ke sijan main dukaiti ke fike pradarshan se yah baat sach sabit hui, jo darasal, 2003 main motogp main unke udghaatan varsh se bhi badtar tha
 In his 2005 autobiography, "what If I'm Never Tried It?", Rossi cited another reason behind choosing Yamaha over shoplifting, making up the mind for shopkeeper Corse and trying to avoid Honda was almost the same
 Was the matter
 antat: rosi ne pratidwandvi yamaha ke saath do saal kaa anubandh kiya, yah anubandh 12 million dollar se kahin adhik kaa tha, yah raashi koi bhi nirmaataa, yahaan tak ki honda bhi dene ko taiyaar nahin tha
 Some commentators say that Rossi will not be able to regain his last year's World Championship win through a cheap machine, especially due to the additions to the RC211V and the likes of Honda's Max Biaggi and Sette Giborno
 The RC211V was a much better machine in every respect, although it was expected that the gap would be reduced with the departure of Rossi and Jeremy Burgess

 Rossi went on to win eight more that season, mainly battling with Sete Giberno, with Rossi deciding the championship before the end of the season at Phillip Island
 Rossi finished the season with 304 points, while Giberno received 257 points and Max Biaggi finished third with 217 points

 The 2006 motogp season began once again with Rossi, his favorite for the championship, but not performing well in the first half of the season
 Hayden maintained the points lead for almost the entire season, but Rossi continued to climb the score ladder slowly
 It was only after Motegi that Rossi took second place after Hayden
 portugali grand pricks main sijan ke aakhri se pehali res main heden ko baahar rakhkar unki jagah unke saathi danni pedrosa ne lee or unhone res samaapt nahin kiya
 This gave Rossi a lead of points, with only one race left of the season

 Rossi returned for the 2007 season of motogp with the new Yamaha YZR M1-800cc ride
 In the first race in Qatar, he came second after Cassi Stoner, a shopkeeper Desmosedici
 Rossi won the second race of the season in Spain in the second round of the season and won three more races that season
 Stoner dominated that season, winning his first title by winning ten races, with Danny Pedrosa finishing second with a clear margin of 125 points
 Seeing Rossi's retirement match with Pedrosa's victory in Valencia's final race meant that he beat Rossi and took Rossi to third place with a one-point lead
 It was Rossi's lowest in the championship since his first season of 1996 in 125s
 2008 ke liye rosi ne brigestone tiron ko apanaaya

 Rossi won his 9th championship title by winning 6 races in the 2009 season, beating his teammate Jorge Lorenzo by 45 points to take him to second place
 Rossi's 6 wins in any championship season were the lowest by number; Earlier in 1999 in the 250 cc category and motogp had minimum number of 9 in 2003, 2004 and 2008

 The rivalry also featured in the 2003 documentary Faster
 2003 / 2004 / 2005 ke sijan main rosi ke mukhya pratidwandvi sete gibernau the, jo 2004 main team grejini ke moviestar honda team ke saath satellite RC211V par or 2005 main naam ke alaava baaki sab kuch, factory RC211V par sawari kii, jise viksit karne main gibernau ne madad kii thi
 They initially had a great friendship, gibernau partying with Rossi on various occasions at the Ibiza villa - but from 2004 the relationship began to soured and culminated in the "qatar incident", the same season as Honda Ponce Rossi's team, along with k Max Biaggi, were penalized for "cleaning" their grid position to aid in traction, and both riders were later charged with the grid's p Was forced to start with six
 gibernau kii team or aadhikarik repsol honda factory team sahit kai tiimon ne rosi ke liye res nirdesh anumodith karne ke liye safaltaapurvak apil kii
 rosi or unke mukhya maikenic jeremi burgess ne jor dekar kaha ki ve aisa kuch nahin kar rahe the jo kharaab trek milane par anya anek ne isse pehle nahin kiya ho
 The two have not had a conversation since then and Rossi appears to have decided to use the incident to put psychological pressure on Gibernau
 katar res ke baad, jisame gibernau kii jeet hui or 6the sthaan par aane ke baad rosi durghatnagrast ho gayi the, kehete hai ki unhone kasam khaayi ki gibernau ko phir se podium ke sabase oonche manch par nahin aane dene ke liye ve sab kuch karenge
dukaiti ke saath 2006 ke sijan main ek asafal res, jisamen ve ghayal hue, ke baad gibernau ne grand pricks racing se sanyas le liya or katar ke baad unhone koi res nahin jeeta, spanish or italvi motorcycle media ke kuch logon ne ise "katar abhishaap" bataakar isaki vyakhya kii
 lekin ve 2008 ke ant main laut aae, 2008 main dukaiti par pareekshan ke baad unhen yakeen ho gaya ki ve abhi bhi motogp main pratisparddha kar sakane ke laayak hai or 2009 main dukaiti par sawari karne ke liye unhone anubandh kiya
 In 2007, Cassie Stoner emerged as a rival to Rossi
 The young Australian won the first race of the year with Duketi, winning several other races, and winning the 2007 motogp World Championship title
 2008 main laguna seka main stoner or rosi kii pratidwandvita ek naatakeey charmotkarsh par ja pahunchi
 kai baar pojishan main badlaav ke baad, rosi ne corkescru ke jariye stoner se aage nikal kaa prayaas kiya
 As a result of this bold move, Rossi had to run on the gravel he had laid and when they came back on the track, the two riders collided with each other
 kuch lap ke baad stoner bajri par jaakar 11wein sthaan par dhimi pravishti main chale gayi, phir bhi bike main teji laakar ve duusare sthaan par ja pahunche, jabaki abhi tak samaapt karne ke liye doosraa len uthaaya jabaki rosi ne res jeet lee
 iske baad, kisi stoner ne tippanee kii 'itihaas ke ek mahanatam rider ke prati meraa aadar samaapt ho gaya
 Stoner apologized to Rossi for this comment in the next race
 apane racing karier ke dauraan vailentino rosi ke kai upnaam pade
 unka pehla pramukh upnaam tha "rosifumi"
 is upnaam kii vyutpatti ke bare main rosi bataate hai ki yah unke saathi savaar norifumi abe kaa ullekh or unke prati shradhanjali he
 His next surname appeared sometime during the days of racing at the 250cc World Championship
 "vailentinic" upnaam italvi donald dak superhiro "peparinik" ke sandarbh main tha
 Rossi began using the nickname "the Doctor" because of his expertise on 500cc and motogp
 125cc or 250cc ke unke ati-uttejnaa ke jamaane main unka pradarshan asthir or khatarnaak hua karata tha, parinamswaroop anek durghatnaayen gata karti thim; us jamaane kii tulana main "apane virodhiyon ko shanti or naidaniktaa ke saath vikhandit karne" racing main shanti or sthirataa se kaam lene kii unki pravriti ke kaaran yah upnaam rakhaa gaya
 There are two types of opinions on why Rossi deserves the nickname "the Doctor"
 ek yah he ki rosi ne ek degree praapt kii he, jo italy main "doctor" oopaadhi ke upyog kaa hakdaar banaati he
 The other opinion is, according to Graziano himself, "the Doctor because, i don't think there is any specific reason, but it is beautiful and important, The Doctor
 And in Italy, to honor someone you name The Doctor
 , This is very important, The Doctor


 Important "
 Although Valentino often jokes that Rossi is a common surname of doctors in Italy, hence the name
 in dinon shaayad hi kabhi rosi durghatnagrast hote hai or darasal unhone lagaataar manch par chadhane kaa record kaayam rakhaa hua he
 At the end of all 23 races from 8 September 2002 to 18 April 2004, including each race in 2003, he stood on the podium
 apane motorcycle grand pricks karier main # 46 number ke saath hi unhone hameshaa res kii
 rosi ne bataaya ki is number ke chayan kii mul prerana rahe japani "wild card" resar norifumi abe the, jinhen unhone geeli res main anbhavi savaaron ko bahut peeche chhodte televijan main dekha tha
 He later finds out that this is the number with which his father recorded his first 3 Grand Prix career victories over the 250c Morbidelli in Yugoslavia in 1979
 vishisht rup se, agle sijan main vishwa championships vijeta ko # 1 stikar se sammanit kiya gaya
 However, in tribute to Barry Sheen, Rossi has held the famous # 46 number throughout his career
 unke helmet par likhaa vaakya unki mitramandali ke liye he: "da trib of da chihuahua," or unke ledar stand par likhaa hua WLF jo "vivaa laa phiga" ke liye he, "laung liv pusi" kaa italvi anuwaad
 un aksharon ko hataane ke liye un par ab tak koi pratibandh nahin laga he yaa unhen koi chetavanee nahin di gayi he, kyonki "WLF" kaa "W" "viva" ke do "V" kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Also, no disciplinary action has been taken on behalf of FIM or Dorna against placing those letters so discreetly on the front of their leather
 unhone apane ledar dizin main apana pasandida rang bhi paramparaagat rup se shaamil kar rakhaa he
 Although Rossi won the motogp title seven times, he did not put the number 1 on his motorcycle representing the world champion, instead staying with his famous "46"
 But by putting # 1 on the shoulder of his leather racing dress, Rossi continued to express himself as a world champion
 purv motorcycle resar sangi or purv timemet colin edwards sahit kuch tivi patrkaar aksar hi unka ullekh 'the GOAT' kahkar kiya karte hai
 Colin Edwards said this in the film 'faster'
 rosi ne valencia main 31 janvari 1 farvari or 2 farvari 2006 ko faraari formula 1 kaa pareekshan kiya
 In the first test, Rossi began to circle the wet track of the gravel trap, thus ending his day
 duusare din, ve pandrah driveron ke tivratam samay main ve nauven sthaan par aaye, maaikel shoomakar se lagbhag ek second peeche, jo khud tisare sthaan par rahe the
 Rossi has made faster rounds than season drivers such as Red Bull Racing's Mark Webber and David Colthard and Toyota F1's Journo Truly
 On the final day of the test, Rossi took a little more than half a second of Schumacher's best time
 Schumacher praised Rossi, calling him infinitely talented and said he was fully capable of Formula One and could become competitive immediately
 24 may 2006 ko rosi ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve motogp main hi rahenge, jab tak ki ve yah mahasoos nahin karte ki motorcycle main unka kaam "samaapt" ho gaya he
 Ferrari driver Schumacher said he was "saddened" by Rossi's decision, but supported him
 rosi ne baad main 2007 or 2008 or phir 2009 or 2010 ke sijan ke liye yamaha ke saath nae anubandhon par hastakshar kiye
 Beyond his interest in F1, Rossi has an overwhelming passion for rallying
 naujavaani main rosi ke nayakon main se ek the WRC champion colin macre
 raily kii kinvadanti macre ne rosi ko raily car driving ke multatv sikhaaye the
 The two competed with each other in 2005, with mcrae on the डाkoda Fabia WRC while Rossi on the Subaru Impreza WRC won
 He officially attended the WRC rally in Great Britain in 2002 for the first time, in which he crashed in the second leg
 11 oktober 2006 ko yah ghoshnaa kii gayi thi ki rosi 17-19 navambar tak chalanevaali varsh kii raily newjiland kii WRC pratiyogita main bhaag lenge
 unhone subaaru WRC car main bhaag liya or 39 pratisparddhiyon main 11wein aaye
 26 navambar 2006 ko ford focus WRC car ko drive karke unhone vaarshik monja raily bhi jeet lee
 unhone saat charnon main se paanch par vijay praapt karke 2005 raily vijeta rinaldo capelo ko 24 second se maat di
 ve purv WRC champion didier oriol ko bhi master sho final ke sidhe mukaable main saat second se maat dene main kaamyaab rahe
 2006 monja raily main rosi ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki ve 2007 raily of great britain main hissaa lenge, haalanki baad main unhone aisa nahin kiya
 Rossi regained Perth at the 2007 Monza rally
 rosi pichley 18 maheenon main formula van or world raily championships donon ke saath jude rahe, pheraari ke liye pareekshan diya or anek raily pratiyogitaaon main bhaag liya
 But Rossi decided to stay in moto-gp, "I have a contract with Yamaha until 2008," Rossi said
 "after that expiration, there will be further thought
 i am confident that i will ride until at least 31 or 32
 i will look to new inspirations over the next few seasons, but at the moment i am completely motivated
 Rossi has given a new a new two-year contract confirmed that he would remain with Yamaha until 2010
 He originally planned to use the Impreza WRC2008 during his participation in the December 2008 rally in GB But instead decided to drive a Ford Focus WRC
 raily main ve 12wein sthaan par rahe, ve antim vijeta sebstian loeb se 13 minute or 20
4 second peeche rahe
 In January 2010, Rossi stated that he hoped to move to the rally when he retired from motorcycle racing
 "between the ages of 22 and 34, there are not many changes in the body of a man, so i still have some time left
 main kaaron ke liye sthanantaran par vichaar kar saktaa hum, shaayad raily main, usase pehle ki maine ise sahajata se lene kaa nirnay kiya he
 

 i know F1 might be a little easier, but by the time i retire from motogp, i will be quite old for F1
 "however, Ferrari's Formula One team chief Stephano Domenicelli reaffirmed that Rossi drives a third Ferrari on the F1 grid, plus he confirmed that Rossi will be tested for the old Ferrari F1 on 21 and 22 January 2010
 march 2010 ko, italvi mantri franco fratini sarkaar ne antarrashtriya str par ke str par apane desh kaa sammaan badhaane ke liye rosi ko pehla vining itaili award diya
 Valentino Rossi adopted many designs of helmets throughout his career, most with motifs of the sun and moon, which would reveal two aspects of his personality
 Rossi's current helmet has graphics artist Aldo Druidy
 vailentino rosi ek bahut hi andhvishwasi vyakti hai or ride se pehle unke karmkand prasiddh hai
 On race day, he always sees the start of 125cc race
 Before the ride, he will start his ritual by stopping about 2 meters from his bike, then bow down and reach his boot
 Then, upon reaching his bike, he will bend down and hold his right foot-peg with his head bowed
 In an interview Rossi said "it's just for a moment to focus and 'talk' to your bike, it's like going from one place to another
 " apane foot-pegon par sidhe khadey hokar ve apane chamade kii poshaak ko thik kiya karte hai, res yaa abhyaas ke shuru hone se pehle pit-len par sawari karte rahete hai
 He also uncovered the secret in an interview with motogp
com that he always kept one boot on top of another, one glove on the other and he always rode the bike on the same side
 apane daahine pair ko bike ke saamne kii ore se laharaate hue ve bike se usee ore se utarate hai
 In 2007, Italian tax authorities declared that Rossi had been investigated on suspicion of tax evasion
 2002 main rosi ke kar-chori ke silsile main asafal tahakikat ke baad adhikariyon ne ghoshnaa kii ki 2000 se 2004 ke bich 112 million euro kii aghoshit aay ke liye ve rosi se poochtacha kar rahe the
 Officials said that against European tax agreements between European countries, Rossi's London residency enabled them to take advantage of favorable tax conditions, such as declaring income earned only in the UK and taxing their beneficial deals and sponsor contracts Giving up, Rossi is said to have "resided in London but is not a resident there
" " gaur kiya gaya ki 2002 main, rosi ke italvi kar-prapatr main 500 euro kii aay kii ghoshnaa kii, jabaki sabhi praayojak anubandhon ko videshi companiyon ke saath hua dikhaaya gaya he, lekin unke maamle mukhya rup se italy se niyantrit hote the
 In February 2008, Rossi announced that he had reached an agreement with the Italian tax authorities: he paid 35 million euros to close the tax-related matter
 kar ghotaalon ke alaava, rosi apane nijee jivan ko yathasambhav logon kii najaron se dur rakhane kii koshish karte hai, haalanki italvi footbal club inter milan ke prati apane sneh ko ve nahin chipaaya karte hai
 After their ninth World Title win in October 2009, Inter Milan congratulated Rossi on their official website
 gaido rosi kaa prakhyat kutta he, jo ek british bulldog he or 2000 se unke paas he
 
 Since Rossi often travels around the world, Guido cannot live in London, so he lives in Rossulia with Rossi's mother
 rosi apane kute se tabhi mil pate hai jab ve apni maa se milane jate hai
 Guido, who is photographed on Rossi's bike and helmet as the mascot, died in 2008 after Australian GP, the new world champion, designed a special sticker of Guido with a pair of wings in the heavenly sky
 Guido also appears in Rossi's bike in some other way
 2006 kii championships main 32 ank par pichhadane par gaido ko inute kaa poshaak pahanaaya gaya
 During the pre-season trial, Guido was dressed as a prisoner
 gaido kii maut par sabakaa dhyaan is kadar kendrit hua ki italy main khel ke pratishthit khel samachar-patr gazeta delo spots main iskaa ullekh kiya gaya
 Since Guido's death, Rossi now has two new dogs, named Caesar and Cecilia

 In the past century in America and Britain, there have been better science fiction stories - Isaac Azimov, Arthur C
 Clarke, Robert Heinlein have been famous science fiction writers
 ab teenon divangat hai
 When Devaki Nandan Khatri, the father of Aiyari and Tilasmi novels in Hindi, appeared in Hindi along with Chandrakanta, it was usually during that period that Ambika Dutt Vyas's wonder wonder-story also created a new array of science fiction writing in Hindi
 ‘piyus pravaah’ patrika main 1884-88 ke madhya dharawahik rup se iskaa prakaashan ho chukaa tha
 The 'wonder story' was purely a science fiction, completely free from mischievous and espionage influences
 udhar bangla bhashaa main "panch kaudi de" jab jasusi sahitya- ‘ghatana-ghatatope’, ‘jai-paraajay’, ‘jivan rahasy’, ‘nil vasana sundari’, ‘mayavi’, ‘-ke nirmaan main pravrutt the to usee kaal main vigyaan kathaayen bhi likhi ja rahi thi, balki kahana yah chahie ki bangala main vigyaan galp kaa unmesh isse purv ho chukaa tha
 Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, an analyst of life in plants and inventor of wireless, wrote the first Bengali science fiction titled 'storm over Victory' in 1897 itself
 anadidhan binraji ne ‘van kusum’, ‘champa phool’, ‘chor’ jaise upanyaason ke saath saath ‘mangal grah’ jaisaa vigyaan galp bhi prastut kiya
 In Marathi, Sridhar Balakrishna Ranade wrote the first science fiction titled 'tareche Humor' in 1915
 praayah isi samay nath madhav ne ‘shrinivas raav’ naamak vaigyanik upanyaas marathi main prastut kiya
 The Hindu readership of Devaki Nandan Khatri created in the backdrop of the Aranyas of Mirzapur, the Hindi readers were astonished and bemused and he took Khatri ji hands
 khanni pranit ‘narendramohini’ ‘virendra vir’, ‘chandrakanta santati’, ‘kusum kumari’, ‘naulakha haar’, ‘guptagodana’ 
 ‘kaagaj kii kothri’ ‘anuthi begum’, ‘bhootnath’ ne lokapriyata kii sari hadein paar kar leen
 The magic of Indrajal of Devaki Nandan Khatri started to speak on the head of the readers
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne ‘hindi sahitya kaa itihaas’ main likhaa he ki khatri ke tilsmi sahitya kaa anand lene ke liye urdubhashiyon ne hindi sikhi
 It was like Khatri's dark world! pathak hi kya, samakaleen lekhak bhi is jaadu ke mohpash main aabaddh hue bina na rah sake
 Then meaningful efforts to create Tilasmi literature started and such things started coming out in a surprising amount and the Hindi readers got wet in it
 is kaal khand main aise lekhakon kii samrudh parampara dikhaai padati he
 Devi Prasad Upadhyay's 'maya-vilas', Jagannath Chaturvedi's 'vasant-malati', Hare Krishna Johar's 'kusum Lata', 'terrible Love', Saraswati Gupta's 'rajkumar', Bal Mukunda Varma's 'kamini', Rajendra Mohini , Hare Krishna Johar Kriti 'vampire', 'manayak-mohini', 'magician' and 'kamal Kumari', Madan Mohan Pathak Kriti 'anand Sundari', Munni Lal Khanni Krita Bahadur ', Hare Krishna Johar Krita' Nirala Masked 'and' terrible blood ', that Rori Lal Goswami wrote 'two-piece of cut mud', Vishweshwar Prasad Varma, 'virendra Kumar', Kishori Lal Goswami, 'yakuti Takhti', Ram Lal Varma's 'putlimahal', Roop Kishore Jain's 'surya Kumar Sambhav' Etc
 are representative works of this literature
 aage bhi yah parampara chalati rahi lekin yaheen se tilsmi sahitya kaa praayah avsaan mana janaa chahie
 It is also a strange coincidence that along with Tilasmi literature, there was a sudden flood of espionage and readers were appreciated and adopted
 hindi main jasusi upanyaason ke prenta gopal ram gahamri hai
 After a brief period of 'chandrakanta' and 'narendra Mohini' of Devaki Nandan Khatri, 'awesome Corpse' and 'detective' also emerged together
 in jasusi upanyaason kii badhati lokapriyata se prerit hokar gahamri ne prabhoot maatra main aisa sahitya rachaa-‘bekasoor kii faansee’, ‘sarakati laash’, ‘khooni koun he ?’, ‘begunaah kaa khun’, ‘jamuna kaa khun’, ‘dabl jasoos’, ‘mayavini’, ‘jaaduugarani manorama’ 1901), ‘ladki chori’, ‘jasoos kii bhul’, ‘thana kii chori’, bhanyakar chori’, ‘andhe kii aankh’, ‘jaal raja’, ‘jaali kaaka’, ‘jasoos kii chori,, ‘malgodaam main chori’, ‘daake par daaka’, ‘doctor kii kahani’, ‘ghar kaa bhedi’, ‘jasoos par jasoos’, ‘devi singh’ 
 ‘ladkaa gaayab’, ‘jasoos chakkar main ’, ‘khooni kaa bhed’, ‘bhojpur kii thangi’ 
 ‘balihaari buddhi’, ‘yoga mahima’ or ‘guptbhed’ aadi
 Even contemporary Hindi writers could not keep themselves afloat due to the influence of detective literature, and many such compositions came out during this period
 yatha-rudradutt sharma krit ‘var singh daaroga’, ‘kishori laal goswami krit ‘jinde kii laash’, ‘jairam gupt krit ‘langadaa khooni’, jang bahadur singh krit ‘vicitra khun’ sher singh krit ‘vilakshan jasoos’, ‘chandrashekhar pathak krit ‘amir ali thang’, ‘shashi bala’ or shiv narayan dvivedi krit ‘amar dutt’ aadi
 But this tradition ends here
 kaaran yah ki hindi main yah parampara naveen thi or angl sahitya se purnatah prabhavit
 The reader quickly got bored of it due to not conforming to the Indian environment
 pathakon kii aruchi ne tilsmi, aiyaari or jasusi sahitya kaa achir main hi garbhalopan bhi kar diya
 With the landing of Premchand, the screen was completely transformed
 1917-18 ke aas-paas tilsmi or jasusi sahitya nepathy main chale gayi
 In the thirties of the twentieth century, psychological and phenomenal novels knocked

 aise main kishori laal goswami ke ‘gupt godana’ ne sanjivani kaa kaam kiya

 While Vishwambhar Nath Sharma presented a cosmic novel called 'turk Taruni', Bhagwati Charan Verma made Wajid Ali Shah's luxury in 'fall' the basis of his narrative
 rishabhcharan kaa ‘gadar’ hindi upanyaason main ek nayi karavat kaa pratik he
 Vrindavanlal Varma carried this tradition forward
 unhone ‘virata kii padmini’ or ‘gadhn kundar’ jaise aitihaasik upanyaason ke srijan ke liye bundelkhand ke bhukhando, samskruti or vahaan ke veeron ke paraspar vaimnasy, prem-prasangon ko apana aadhaar banaaya
 The 'cane' of Krishna Nand Gupta is also a creation of this category
 bhagwati charan verma ne ‘chitralekha’ main paap or punya kii vishad vyakhya kii
 Premchand's 'durgadas' and Chatur Sen Shastri's 'rana Raj Singh' made aiyari-tilasmi-espionage literature a contradiction, and this tradition ended there
 hindi kii vigyaan kathaon ke bare main likhte samay log praayah keshav prasad singh kii ‘chandralok kii yatra’ kaa pratham vigyaan galp ke rup main ullekh karte hai
 So far there is such a view
 kadaachit iskaa kaaran pan shrinarayan chaturvedi kii vah tippanee he jo unhone ‘saraswati’ patrika ke 60 varsh puure hone ke uplakshya main prakashit ‘hirak jayanti visheshank’ ke kahani khand ke aarambh main di thi
 In Part 1, Number 6, 'saraswati', for the first time, two stories were published simultaneously
 kishori laal goswami kii ‘indumati’ or keshav prasad singh kii ‘chadralok kii yatra’
 Chaturvedi ji comments on these - the second story seems to be written based on an English story
 vah lambii he or dharawahik rup se prakashit hui thi
 'indumati' is the first story of modern style in Hindi, not only in Saraswati
 ’ He made 'chandralok's journey' unimportant by calling it anglo-based, but declared 'indumati' as the first Hindi story
 ‘isse pahile ‘harishchandra chandrika’ or ‘piyush praavah’ main ek-do kahaniyaan chhapi thim
 Stories before Pandit Ambika Dutt Vyas's 'surprise-history' and Pandit Bal Krishna Bhatt's 'nutan Brahmachari' had probably been published before this
 kintu ‘indumati’ ko hi hindi kii pahili aadhunik kahani hone kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 ' sambhawatah kahkar unhone apni baat samaapt kar di lekin yadi isaki padtaal karne kii cheshtaa hi gai hoti to yah vibhram samaapt ho gaya hota ki pratham hindi vigyaan galp koun-sa he ? yadhyapi hindi main yah vimarsh aaj bhi jari he ki hindi kii pehali aadhunik kahani koun si he
 


 'indumati'? Insha Alla Khan's 1803 story of Rani Ketki? Or Pandit Gauri Dutt Praneet 'deorani Jethani Ka Kahani', published in 1870, which is actually a short social novel
 is vimarsh main pratibhaag karne kaa yahaan na to mujhe avkaash he or na hi yah charchaa praasangik hi he
 Ambika Dutt Vyas published the serial 'surprise History' in the self-edited magazine 'puc-pravah' which was first printed in 1893 from Vyas Yantralaya, Bhagalpur

 Ambika Dutt Vyas became a Goloki at a very young age but he was a very talented artist, he attained adult wisdom at a young age
