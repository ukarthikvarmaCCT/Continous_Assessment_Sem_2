 When the demon Tarakasura created a fire, the gods begged Kamadeva to kill Tarakasura so that he could fall in love with Shiva and Parvati because Tarakasura had the boon that only Shiva and Parvati's son can kill Tarakasura
 to kaamdev tathaa devi rati kailash parvat shiv kaa dhyaan bhang karne ke liye gayi par kaamdev kaa baan lagane se shiv kaa dhyaan to bhang ho gaya par shiv ko bahut krodh aa gaya va shiv ne apana teesraa netra khol kar kaamdev ko bhasma kar diya tathaa rati ko bhi apane kii mrityu par krodh aa gaya to rati ne parvati ko shraap diya ki parvati ke pet se koi bhi putr janm nahi legaa

 An alcoholic elephant can be seen in three directions and can be cautious even if a slight sound is made at the back
 hathi kaanon se har taraf kaa sun saktaa he or apni sound se chaaron dishaao main waar kar saktaa he

 The Chairman of the UN Counter Terrorism Committee believes that this committee has been made aware of 12 international agreements on the subject and none of them referred to state terrorism, which was not an international legal concept
 Abuse of power, they should be judged against handling international conventions war crimes, international human rights And international humanitarian law
 Former United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan has said that it is "time to set aside the debate over alleged state terrorism"
 The use of force by these states is already fully regulated under international law "however, he also Said that, "


 regardless of the difference between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on made clear innocent citizens Not any attack on, " State terrorism has been used by government agents or forces to refer to terrorist incidents

 State terrorism has also been used to describe peace time actions by government agents or forces, such as the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
 The concept is also used to describe Is political repression by governments against their own civilian population to incite fear with this purpose
 For example, taking and executing civil hostages The extrajudicial eradication campaign is commonly considered "terror" or terrorism, for example during the Red Terror or the Great Terror
 Such actions are often also described as Demosidae which have been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism
 Empirical studies on democracy have found the younger Demosidae

 The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political struggle
 This type of conflict varies widely; Historical examples include: aatankwaadi hamalon main aksar dar or prachaar ko adhiktam karne ke liye lakshith kar rahe hai
 They commonly use explosives or poisons, but there is also concern about using terrorist attacks weapons of mass destruction
 Militant organizations may usually methodically plan attacks in advance and train participants, plant "undercover" agents and Organized crime through supporters or raising money again

 There are demands for greed or grievances placed by terrorists
 Supply is driven by relative deprivation resulting in triple losses - growth deficit, democratic deficit and dignity deficit 
acts of terrorism take place at the point of intersection between supply and demand

 The tariff is generally levied on imported goods
 tarriff arthath prashulk, aayaat yaa niryaat par lagaaya jane vaala tex arthath kar he
 Tariffs, generally protectionism, are linked to economic policy limiting trade between countries
 raajnneetik kaarnon se, tarriff, aam taur par aaayaatit maal par lagaaya jaataa he, haalanki niryaatit maal par bhi tarriff lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Compared to nowadays, in the past, tariffs accounted for a much larger share of government revenue
 jab maal se bharaa jahaaj kisi seemaa paar yaa bandargah par pahunchataa he, to seemaa shulk adhikari samagriyon kaa nirikshan karte hai or un samagriyon par tarriff formula arthath prashulk sutara ke anusaar ek tarah kaa kar lagaaya jaataa he
 Since the goods cannot move until the duty has been paid, it is the easiest duty to be collected and the cost of its collection is also less
 tarriff se bachane kii koshish karne vaale vyapaariyon ko smagaller arthath taskaron ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 There are different types of tariffs: ve anuchit sthanantaran keemat kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karte hai jahaan koi company vyapaar kiye jane vaale maal ke mulya kii ghoshnaa karata he jo bazaar keemat se alag hota he jiskaa uddeshy kul shesh karon main katautee karnaa hota he
 In the 20th century, tariffs are determined by a tariff commission based on information received from the government or local authority, or on the spur of industry structure studies
 aadhunik samay main kar, tarriff or vyapaar sambandhi niyamon ko aam taur par audyogic niti, nivesh niti or krishigat niti par unke aam prabhaav kii vajah se ek saath sthapit yaa nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 a trade bloc is a group of allied countries to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other barriers or tariffs imposed on trade with each other and possibly on the goods imported from a country outside that bloc
 Agree to impose tariffs
 seemaa shulk sangh kaa ek aam bahari tarriff hota he or, sahmati sutara ke anusaar, isamen bhaag lene vaale desh is seemaa shulk sangh main pravesh karne vaale maalon par lagaae jane vaale teriffon se praapt rajasav ko aapas main baant lete hai
 If a country's major industries lose out on foreign competition, loss of work and tax revenue can severely distort that country's economy and increase poverty
 agar kisi desh ke jeevanyaapan kaa maanak yaa audyogic niyamon kaaphi ooncha ho to gharelu udyog chote deshon ke saath samjhauta kiye bina unke saath asanrakshit vyapaar ko jivit rakh sakate hai; is samjhaute main neeche kii ek vaishvik daud shaamil he
 Protective tariffs have historically been used as a measure against this possibility
 haalanki, sangrakshnatmak teriffon se nuksaan bhi hota he
 Most notable is that they inhibit the price of goods subject to tariffs by weakening local competition, causing losses to consumers or manufacturers of the goods who use the goods to produce something different: for example, Food tariffs can increase poverty, while tariffs on steel or steel may make automobile manufacturers less competitive
 ve ulti pratikriya bhi kar sakate hai agar tarriff se nuksaan hone vaale vyapaar ko karne vaale desh khud par hi tarriff lagaate hai jiske parinamswaroop vyapaar yuddh shuru ho jaataa he or, mukt vyapaar siddhantkaron ke anusaar, donon pakshon ko nuksaan uthaanaa padataa he
 According to neo-traditional economic principles, tariffs are a harmful interference with the laws of individual freedom and free market
 unka vishwaas he ki sthaneey maangon dwaara aksham kiye gaye kisi udyog kaa kritrim rup se rakrakhaav karnaa upabhoktaaon ke prati anuchit or aam taur par kisi desh ke liye nuksaandaayak he or ve yah bhi maanate hai ki iskaa patan hone kii ijaajat dena behatar he
 The reverse side of all tariffs is part of the free trade principle; The objective of the World Trade Organization is to reduce tariffs and to keep countries away from discrimination between different countries when implementing tariffs
 nimnlikhit graph main ham gharelu arthvyavastha par aayaat tarriff ke prabhaav ko dekhte hai
 In a closed economy with no trade, we will see a balance at the intersection point of the demand and supply curve that yields a $ 70 gain in price and a product of y *
 is maamle main, upabhokta kaa adhishesh A, b or k binduon ke bheetar ke kshetra ke baraabar hoga, jabaki nirmaataa ke adhishesh ko A, b or l kshetra ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he
 While incorporating free international trade into this model, we establish a new supply curve that is reported as SW
 is vakrarekha se ek purvanumaan miltaa he ki maal yaa seva kii antarrashtriya aapurti puri tarah se namya he or yah bhi ki duniya main bataai gai keemat par ek najdiki anant maatra main utpaadan ho saktaa he
 Obviously, in real-world situations, this is somewhat impractical or unrealistic, but making such predictions is unlikely to have any material impact on the model's outcome
 is maamle main maal kii antarrashtriya keemat 50 dollar he 
 The above model is completely accurate only in extreme situations where none belongs to the consumer group and the cost of the product is a fraction of their salary
 agar iske bajaay, ham vipareet charam sthiti ko lete hai or maan lete hai ki sabhi upabhokta nirmaataa samooh se sambandhit hai or yah bhi maan lete hai ki unki ekmaatr kharidari shakti vetan se sambandhit he jo utpaadan ke rup main praapt hota he or utpaada kii laagat unka puraa vetan he, to graph ekadam alag dikhaai detaa he
 Without tariffs, only producers or manufacturers / consumers capable of producing the product at world price would have enough money to buy it at that price
 chote exl trikon ko kharidne main abhi bhi samarth upabhoktaaon ke ek samaan chote darpan chhavi trikon se milan kiya jayega
 tarriff ke saath, ek bada sidiel trikon or uskaa darpan batch paaegaa
 Also note that there is no incentive to buy imported goods over domestic, with tariffs or without tariffs, as each has the same price
 keval rin ke madhyam se, parisampattiyon ko bechakar, yaa nai tarah kii gharelu utpaadan se nae vetan ke madhyam se uplabdh kharidne kii shakti main pherbadal karke aaayaatit maal ko karidaa jayega
 yaa, jaahir he, agar isaki keemat keval mazdooree yaa vetan kaa ek ansh ho
 In the real world, as more imported goods replace domestic goods, they consume a much larger fraction of the available domestic salaries, leading the graph to move towards this approach of the model
 agar utpaadan ke nae tareeke samay par na mili, to desh diwalia ho jayega or aatanrik raajnneetik dabaav ke falswaroop rin kaa bhugtan nahin ho paaegaa, bahut zyada tarriff lagegaa, yaa usase bhi badtar haalat ho jaaegi
 The establishment of tariffs slows down this process, allowing more time for new types of production to develop, but it also strengthens industries that may never regain competitive pricing
 tarriff ko ek swatantra raashtra kii sthapana karne ke liye ek raajnneetik upkaran ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america kaa tarriff act of 1789 arthath prashulk adhinium 1789, jis par vishesh rup se 4 july ko hastakshar kiya gaya tha, ko akhbaaron ne "second dikaleyareshan of independence" arthath 'swatantraaa kii duusari ghoshnaa' kaha kyonki iskaa makasad saarvbhaumik or swatantra sanyukt rajya america ke raajnneetik lakshya kii prapti ke liye ek aarthik saadhan bananaa tha
 In modern times, the political impact of tariffs is seen in a positive and negative sense
 2002 united stats steel tarriff arthath 2002 kaa sanyukt rajya america ispaat prashulk ne teen varshon kii ek avadhi tak vibhinn prakaar ke aaayaatit steel utpaadon par 30% kaa tarriff lagaaya
 america steel utpaadakon ne tarriff kaa samarthan kiya, lekin kaato institute ne is kadam kii aalochana kii
 Tariffs can sometimes emerge as a political issue before an election

 The Liberal Party made a similar commitment, while independent applicant Nick Xenophon announced his intention to establish tariff-based legislation as "a matter of urgency"

 If Bengali language is kept in mind, its title should be "bande Mataram" and not "vande Mataram"
 chunki hindi va sanskrit bhashaa main 'vande' shabd hi sahi he, lekin yah geet mularoop main bangla lipi main likhaa gaya tha or chunki bangla lipi main va akshar he hi nahin at: bande maataram sheershak se hi bankim chandra chattopadhyaay ne ise likhaa tha
 Keeping this fact in mind, the title should have been 'bande Mataram'
 parantu sanskrit main 'bande maataram' kaa koi shabdaarth nahin he tathaa "vande maataram" uccharan karne se "mata kii vandana karata hoon" aisa arth nikalataa he, atah devanagari lipi main ise vande maataram hi likhnaa va padhanaa samichin hoga

 Gives expression to

 Despite the decisive participation of this song in the freedom struggle, when it came to the selection of the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, a song written and sung by Rabindranath Thakur, was given preference over Vande Mataram
 isaki vajah yahi thi ki kuch musalamaanon ko "vande maataram" gane par aapatti thi, kyonki is geet main devi durga ko raashtra ke rup main dekha gaya he
 Apart from this, he also believed that the Anand Math novel from which this song was taken was written against Muslims
 in aapattiyon ke maddenjar san 1937 main congress ne is vivaad par gaharaa chintan kiya
 The committee constituted under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, found that the first two verses of the song are said to be in praise of the motherland, but later verses mention Hindu deities; Therefore, it was decided that only the first two verses of this song will be used as national songs

 After achieving independence, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad read a statement in the Constituent Assembly on 24 January 1950 regarding the adoption of 'vande Mataram' as a national anthem
 dow rajendra prasad kaa samvidhan sabha ko diya gaya vaktavy is prakaar he) : There are also some controversies about the Anand Math novel, some staunch people consider it anti-muslim
 unka kahana he ki isamen musalamaanon ko videshi or deshadrohi bataaya gaya he
 The song Vande Mataram is also being debated
 is geet ke pehle do band, jo ki praasangik hai, main koi bhi muslim virdohi baat nahin he or na hi kisi devi yaa durga kii aradhana he
 But these people say that- haalaanki aisa nahin he ki bharat ke sabhi musalamaanon ko is par aapatti he yaa sab hindu ise gane par jor dete hai
 It is also worth mentioning that a few years ago, the famous music composer AR Rahman, himself a Muslim, had prepared a music album about Vande Mataram which became very popular
 adhiktar logon kaa maananaa he ki yah vivaad raajnneetik he
 Can anyone be forced to sing a song or not? This question was raised before the Supreme Court in a suit named Bijoy Emmanuel Versace State of Kerala
 is vaad main kuch vidhyaarthiyon ko skool se isaliye nikaal diya gaya tha kyonki unhone raashtra-gaan jan gana man ko gane se manaa kar diya tha
 These students used to stand in honor of the national anthem at school and respected it but did not sing the song
 gane ke liye unhone manaa kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court accepted his plea and asked the school to withdraw him
 sarvocch nyaayalay kaa kahana tha ki yadi koi vyakti raashtragan kaa sammaan to karata he par use gaata nahin he to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki vah iskaa apmaan kar rahaa he
 Therefore, that person cannot be punished or tortured for not singing it
 chunki vande maataram is desh kaa raashtragit he at: isko jabardastee gane ke liye majaboor karne par bhi yahi kanoon va niyam lagu hoga

 rawal ratnasingh chittod ke shaasha the
 His reign was short-lived
 bappa rawal ke vansh main samar singh ke do putron main ratnasingh ek yogya parakramee shaasha tha, ratna singh ke bhai kumbhakarna pehle se hi mewar ko chhodkar nepal palaayan kar gaye, is kaaran ratan singh shaasha bane jo rawal shakha ke antim shaasha the | Seated on the throne of Chittor in the very early years of the fourteenth century
 inaki vishesh khyaati hindi ke mahakavy padmavat main raja ratansen ke naam se rahi he
 Some historians believe his ascension in 1301 AD and some in 1302 AD
 inaki patni itihaas-prasiddh rani padmini yaa padmavati thi
 These were destroyed along with the family and the government in 1303 AD by the invasion of Alauddin Khilji
 praayah 1 varsh kaa hi shashan kaal hone tathaa inke saath hi inke vansh kaa ant ho jane se pashchaatkaaleen bhaaton-chaarnon kii gaathaon main inkaa naam hi lupt ho gaya tha
 Even being based mainly on these sources, they have not even been named in Colonel Tod's famous Rajasthani treatise
 unke sthaan par atyant bhraamak rup se bhimsingh se inaki patni rani padmini kaa sambandh joda gaya he
 Renowned historian Mahamahopadhyay Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha proved the historicity of Rawal Ratnasinh while clarifying Colonel Tod's mistake
 ojha ji ne sari bhrantiyaan tathaa sachai spasht karte hue likhaa he ki "rawal summersingh ke peeche uskaa putr ratnasingh chittod kii gaddi par baitha
 It was only a few months before he ruled, so Sultan of Delhi Alauddin Khilji attacked Chittor and after fighting for more than six months, he took the fort
 mewar ke kuch khyaton, rajprashasti, mahakavy or karnal tod ke rajasthan main to ratnasingh kaa naam tak nahin diya
 Karan Singh is written to be the king after Samarsingh, but Karansingh is not after Samarsingh, but it was 8 generations before that
 muhanot nanasi apni khyath main likhata he ki ratansi padmani ke maamle main allaudin se ladakar kaam aayaa; parantu vah ratnasingh ko ek jagah to samarsi kaa putr or duusari jagah ajaisi kaa putr or bhadlakhamasi kaa bhai batalaata he, jisamen se pichhlaa kathan vishwaas-yogya nahin he, kyonki lakhamasi ajaisi kaa putr nahin kintu pita or sisode kaa sardaar tha
 Thus Ratnasinh was not the brother of Lakhmsi but the lord of Mewar and the son of Samarsingh, as found in the inscription and Ekalingamahatmya of Kumbhalgarh dated 1517, around the time of Rana Kumbhakarna
 in donon main yah bhi likhaa he ki summersingh ke peeche uskaa putr ratnasingh raja hua
 When he was killed, Lakshman Singh was killed, along with his seven sons, by destroying the Mlechchas for the protection of Chittor
 " No details are available regarding Ratnasinh more than the ancient inscriptions etc
 allaudin khilji ke akraman se sambaddh vivaran amir khusro ke 'tarikhe alaai' main miltaa he
 The above book by Amir Khusro shows that Sultan Alauddin Khilji left Delhi to take Chittor on 28 January 1303 AD and the fort was conquered on 26 August 1303 AD
 allaudin khilji ke akraman ke sambandh main mahakavi malik mohammad jaaysi ne apane suprasiddh mahakavy padmavat main likhaa he ki yah akraman raja ratansen kii adwitiya sundari patni padmavati ko praapt karne ke liye hua tha or anek varshon tak gheraa daalane ke baad asafal hokar khilji laut gaya tha tathaa dubaara akraman karke vijayi hua tha
 But now with the historical facts coming out, historians have started to believe that the main reason for the invasion was the imperial ambition of Alauddin and the military and commercial utility of Chittor
 gujarat, malwa, madhya pradesh, sanyukt praant, sindh aadi bhaagon ke vyapaarik maarg chittod se hokar guzarate the
 It is natural that an ambitious Sultan like Alauddin Khilji would like to authorize it
 yah sambhav he ki padmini kii sundarataa jaanakar uskaa ek uddeshy use praapt karnaa bhi ho gaya ho
 Whatever be the reason, but Alauddin's invasion destroyed the life of Rawal Ratnasinh along with the rule and Rani Padmini, along with her majority friends and other queens, became Sati by doing Jauhar

 raja sahab ne is vishay par mantriyon, darbariyon tathaa vidwatajanon se gahan vichaar-vimarsh kiya, tatkaaleen yuddh ke sadhano evam unki maarak kshamta kaa dhyaan rakhte hue kila banane kaa nirnay liya gaya, jiske falswaroop kile ke donon taraf majboot daravaaje jinamein nukile lohe kii salakhen lagaayi gayi
 At that time the prevalence of cannons and gunpowder was very high, so that the strongest walls of the forts could be easily demolished
 isliye pehle kile kii chaudee-chaudee majboot pathar kii unchi-unchi prachiren banaayi gayi, ab in par topon ke golon kaa asar nahin ho iske liye in deevaaron ke chaaron ore saikadon foot chaudee kachi mitti kii diwaar banaayi gayi or neeche saikadon foot gahari or chaudee khai banaakar usamen pani bharaa gaya, jisase dushman ke dwaara topon ke gole deevaaron par daagne ke baad wo mitti main dhansakar dam tod de or agar neeche kii ore prahaar kare to pani main shant ho jaae or pani ko paar kar sapaat diwaar par chadhana to mushkil hi nahin asambhav tha
 In difficult times, by closing the doors of the fort, the soldiers used to make the whole fort easily impenetrable, just behind the paved walls and taking a front on the doors
 jis kile main leshmaatr bhi loha nahin laga or apni abhedyata ke bal par lohgarh kahalaaya
 From time to time, the teeth of the enemies were sour and forced the enemy to get his iron
 aise the bharatpur ke doordarshee raja
 The Lohagad fort was built in the early 18th century by Jat ruler Maharaja Suraj Mal
 yah kila bharatpur ke jat shaskaon kii himmat or shaury kaa pratik he
 This fort became known as Lohagad due to its security system
 kile ke chaaron ore gahari khai hai jo ise suraksha pradaan karti he
 Although Lohagad Fort is not as luxurious as other forts in the region, but its strength and grandeur is amazing
 kile ke andar mahatvapurn sthaan hai— kishori mahal, mahal khaas, moti mahal or kothi khaas
