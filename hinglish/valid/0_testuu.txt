 These policies undoubtedly helped maintain power and the stability of the empire, were protected by two immediate successors, but were abandoned by Aurangzeb, who adopted a policy that had little place for religious tolerance
 iske alaava aurangzeb ne lagbhag apane puure jivan-vritti main deccan or dakshin bharat main apane daayre kaa vistaar karne kii koshish kii
 This enterprise drained the resources of the empire which aroused strong resistance within the Marathas, Sikhs of Punjab and Hindu Rajputs
 aurangzeb ke shasankaal ke baad, samrajya main giravat hui
 Beginning with Bahadur Zafar Shah I, the Mughal emperors declined in power and became fictitious chieftains, initially controlled by various diverse courtesans and later by several rising chieftains
 18 veen shatabdi main, is samrajya ne persia ke nadir shah or afghanistan ke ahamed shah abdali jaise hamalaavaron kaa lut ko saha, jinhone baar baar mogul rajdhani dilli main lutpaat kii
 The Marathas were defeated before the British got most of the territories of this empire in India
 1803 main, andhe or shaktiheen shah alam II ne aupchaarik rup se british east india company kaa sangrakshan sweekaar kiya
 The British government had started calling the already weak Mughals the "king of Delhi" rather than the "emperor of India", which was formally exercised in 1803, which led to the uneasy implication of the Indian King moving on from the British Emperor
 Avoided
 phir bhi, kuch dashakon ke baad, BEIC ne samraat ke nammaatr naukaron ke rup main or unke naam par, apane niyantran ke adheen kshetron main shashan jari rakhaa, 1827 main yah shishtachar bhi khatm ho gaya tha
 When some rebels of the Sepoy Mutiny announced their allegiance to Bahadur Zafar Shah II, a descendant of Shah Alam, the British decided to abolish this institution altogether
 unhone 1857 main antim mogul samraat ko pad se giraaya or unhen burma ke liye nirvasit kiya, jahaan 1862 main unki mrityu ho gai
 Thus came the end of the Mughal dynasty, which contributed an important chapter to the history of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan
 mogul samraaton ke bare main kuch mahatvapurn vivaran neeche sarinibaddh he: Akbar Shah II bhartiya upmahadweep ke liye mughalon kaa pramukh yogadan unki anuthi vaastukala thi
 Many great monuments including the Taj Mahal were built by the Muslim emperors during the Mughal period
 muslim mogul rajvansh ne bhavy mehalon, kabron, minaaron or kilon ko nirmit kiya tha jo aaj dilli, dhaka, agra, jaipur, lahore, shekhpura, bharat, pakistan or bangladesh ke kai anya shaharon main khadey hai
 His successors, with little recollection of the Central Asian country for which they waited, took a less lively view of the subcontinent's culture and became quite self-sufficient
 unhone kai upmahadwipon ke lakshan or pratha ko avashoshit kiya
 The Mughal period saw the blending of the Indian, Iranian and Central Asian artistic, intellectual and literary traditions into a more fruitful one than others in India's history
 bhartiya upmahadweep kii donon, hindu or muslim paramparaon, samskruti or style par baari prabhaav padaa tha
 He brought many notable changes to the societies and culture of the subcontinent, including: mughalon ke tahat kala or vaastukala kaa ullekhneey kusumit kai karkon ke kaaran he
 This empire provided a safe framework for the development of artistic talent and promoted unique wealth and resources in the history of this subcontinent
 swayan mogul shaasha kala ke asaadhaaran sangrakshak the, jinaki bauddhik kshamta or saanskrithik drushtikon ko sabase parishkrut swaad main vyakt kiya gaya tha
 Although the Hindustan he once ruled is now divided into Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, his influence can still be seen widely

 They have 160 million dynasties, spread across the continent and possibly the world

 Ayurveda is one of the oldest medical systems in the world
 yah vigyaan, kala or darshan kaa mishran he
 The name 'ayurveda' means 'knowledge of life' and that is the essence of Ayurveda in a nutshell
 "ayurveda " shabd do shabdon se milakar bana he - "aayush" or "veda"
 , Ahit Age, Happiness Age, and Grief Age - they should be described as Ayurveda
 ) Ayurveda is Indian medicine
 ayurvigyaan, vigyaan kii vah shakha he jiskaa sambandh maanav sharir ko nirog rakhane, rog ho jane par rog se mukt karne athwa uskaa shaman karne tathaa aayu badhaane se he
 Ayurveda is the literature existing in the world, after which we can analyze our own lifestyle
 is shaastra ke aadi acharya ashvinikumar maane jate hai jinhone daksh prajapati ke dhad main bakre kaa sir joda tha
 Indra acquired this knowledge from Ashwini Kumar
 indra ne dhanvantari ko sikhaaya
 King of Kashi, Divodas is said to be the incarnation of Dhanvantari
 unase jaakar sushrut ne ayurveda padhaa
 Atri and Bharadwaj are also considered to be the promoters of this scripture
 apurveda ke acharya ye hai— ashvinikumar, dhanvantari, divodas, nakul, sahadev, arki, chyavan, janak, budh, jawal, jajali, pel, karath, agastya, atri tathaa unke chah shishy, sushrut or charak
 Brahma divided Ayurveda into eight parts and named each part 'tantra'
 ye aath bhaag nimnlikhit hai : Under this Ashtanga Ayurveda, there are also the elements of the body, physiology, armaments, pharmaceuticals and matter properties, medical elements and science
 iske atirikt usamen sadrush chikitsa, virdohi chikitsa or jalchikitsa aadi aajkal ke abhinav chikitsa pranaaliyon ke vidhaan bhi paye jate hai 
 According to archaeologists, the ancient book of the world is Rigveda
 vibhinn vidwaanon ne iskaa rachana kaal isa ke 3,000 se 50,000 varsh purv tak kaa mana he
 Even in this Samhita, the principles of the great importance of Ayurveda are disseminated here
 charak, sushrut, kaashyap aadi maanya granth ayurveda ko atharvaveda kaa upved maanate hai
 This proves the antiquity of Ayurveda
 atah ham kah sakate hai ki ayurveda kii rachanakaal isa purv 3,000 se 50,000 varsh pehle yani sristi kii utpatti ke aas-paas yaa saath kaa hi he
 In the context of historical knowledge of Ayurveda, the first mention of knowledge, according to Charaka, is the mention of Agnivesh - with the descent of Ayurveda in the death of the dead
 sarvapratham brahma se prajapati ne, prajapati se ashvini kumaron ne, unase indra ne or indra se bharadwaj ne ayurveda kaa adhyayan kiya
 The tenure of Chyavan Rishi has also been considered a contemporary of Ashwini Kumars
 ayurveda ke vikaas main rishi chyavan kaa atimahatvapurn yogadan he
 Then Bharadwaj got a long happy and healthy life under the influence of Ayurveda and propagated it among other sages
 tadnantar punarvasu aatreya ne agnivesh, bhel, jatu, parashar, harit or ksharpani naamak chah shishyon ko ayurveda kaa upadesh diya
 The most intelligent of these six disciples, Agnivesh first created a Samhita - the Agnivesh Tantra which was later re-invented by Charaka and named it Charaksamhita, which is the foundation pillar of Ayurveda
 sushrut ke anusaar kashiraj divodas ke rup main avatarit bhagwaan dhanvantari ke paas anya maharshiryon ke saath sushrut jab ayurveda kaa adhyayan karne hetu gayi or unase aavedan kiya
 At that time, Lord Dhanvantari preached to them that Brahma himself first published the Upveda Ayurveda of Atharvaveda in a thousand chapters - Shata Sahasra Shlokas before the creation of the universe and then divided it into eight organs by considering the human being as short-sighted
 is prakaar dhanvantari ne bhi ayurveda kaa prakaashan brahmadev dwaara hi pratipaadit kiya hua mana he
 Lord Dhanvantari again said that Daksha Prajapati from Brahma, Ashvinikumar Dwya from him and Indra studied Ayurveda from him
 ayurveda ke itihaas ko mukhyatya teen bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he - The time of the Code was in the 5th century BC
 It is believed to be from the 6th century
 yah kaal ayurveda kii moulik rachanaaon kaa yug tha
 At this time, Acharyo, on the strength of his talent and experience, practiced his erudite texts about different organs
 ayurveda ke trimuni - charak, sushrut or vagbhat, ke udai kaa kaal bhi samhitakaal hi he
 The amazing success in the field of karyotherapy through Charaka Samhita Granth is a major feature of this period
 iskaa samay 7veen shatee se lekar 15veen shatee tak mana gaya he tathaa yah kaal aalochanaon evam tikaakaron ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In this period, commentators on the compositions of the Samhidakala formulated mature and healthy interpretations
 is samay ke acharya dalhan kii sushrut samhita tikaa ayurveda jagat main ati mahatvapurn maani jaati he
 The research text 'rasaratnasamuchaya' is also a composition of this period, which has been written by Acharya Vagbhat based on Charaka and Sushruta Samhita and the composition of many rasastriyas
 is kaal kaa samay 14veen shatee se lekar aadhunik kaal tak mana jaataa he
 This period has been the period of writings of texts on specific subjects
 madhavnidan, jverdarpan aadi granth bhi isi kaal main likhe gayi
 Special attention was also paid to various forms of medicine in this period, which is relevant even in the present day
 is kaal main ayurveda kaa vistaar evam prayog bahut bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 It is clear that the antiquity of Ayurveda has been proved since the Vedas
 aadhunik chikitsapaddati main saamaajik chikitsa paddati ko ek nai vichaardhara mana jaataa he, parantu yah koi nai vichaardhaara nahin apitu yah uski punrariti maatr he, jiskaa ullekh 2500 varshon se bhi pehle ayurveda main kiya gaya he
 The aim of Ayurveda is to protect the health of healthy animals and protect the patient from disease
 
 Ayurveda has two objectives: iske liye apane sharir or prakruti ke anukool desh, kaal aadi kaa vichaar karnaa niyamit aahaar-vihaar, cheshtaa, vyaayaam, shouch, snaan, shayan, jaagran aadi grihasth jivan ke liye upyogi shastrokt dincharya, ratricharya evam ritucharya kaa paalan karnaa, sankatmay kaaryon se bachanaa, prayek kaary vivekpurvak karnaa, man or indriya ko niyantrit rakhana, desh, kaal aadi paristhitiyon ke anusaar apane apane sharir aadi kii shakti or ashakti kaa vichaar kar koi kaary karnaa, mel, mutr aadi ke upasthit vegon ko na rokna, irshyaa, dwesh, lobh, ahankaar aadi se bachanaa, samay-samay par sharir main sanchit dosha ko nikaalane ke liye vaman, virechan aadi ke prayogon se sharir kii shuddhi karnaa, sadachaar kaa paalan karnaa or dooshit vaayu, jal, desh or kaal ke prabhaav se utpann mahamariyon main vijna chikitsakon ke upadeshon kaa samuchit rup se paalan karnaa, svachh or vishodhit jal, vaayu, aahaar aadi kaa seven karnaa or dusron ko bhi iske liye prerit karnaa, ye swasthyaraksha ke saadhan hai
 For each disease ye teenon ayurveda ke 'triskandh' kehalaati hai
 It is detailed in Ayurveda texts
 yahan keval sankshipt parichay maatr diya jayega
 But before that, a brief introduction of each ingredient is necessary, because without the knowledge of the components it will not be possible to know the disorders that occur in them
 ayurveda kaa arth pracheen aacharyon kii vyakhya or isamen aae hue 'aayu' or 'veda' in do shabdon ke arthon ke anusaar bahut vyapak he
 The Acharyas of Ayurveda have called the 'combination of body, sense, mind and soul' as age
 arthath jab tak in chaaron sampatti yaa vipatti ke anusaar aayu ke anek bhed hote hai, kintu sankshep main prabhaavbhed se ise chaar prakaar kaa mana gaya he : Sukhayu: a person rich in knowledge, science, force, strength, wealth, wealth, fame, family, etc
, being devoid of any kind of physical or mental development, is called "sukhayu"
 dukhaayu : iske vipareet samast sadhano se yukt hote hue bhi, shareerik yaa maansik rog se peedit athwa nirog hote hue bhi saadhanheen yaa swasthya or saadhan donon se hin vyakti ko "du:khaayu' kehete hai
 Hitayu: a person who possesses qualities like prudence, virtue, gentleness, generosity, truth, non-violence, peace, benevolence, etc
, while being full of health and resources or lacking in them, and continues in the welfare of society and the people
 He is called Hitayu
 ahitayu : iske vipareet jo vyakti avivek, duraachaar, krurta, swaarth, dambh, atyaachaar aadi durgunon se yukt or samaaj tathaa lok ke liye abhishaap hote hai unhen ahitayu kehete hai
 Thus, there are four distinctions of interest, harm, happiness and grief
 isi prakaar kalpramaan ke anusaar bhi dderghaayu, madhyaayu or alpaayu, sankshep main ye teen bhed hote hai
 By the way, many distinctions can also be imagined in these three
 'veda' shabd ke bhi satta, laabh, gati, vichaar, prapti or gyaan ke saadhan, ye arth hote hai or aayu ke veda ko ayurveda kehete hai
 That is, the scripture in which the nature of age, the various distinctions of age, beneficial and disrespectful to age and the means of their knowledge and the corporeal body of age, sense, mind and soul, with the development of all or any of these interests, pleasures and Ayurveda is considered to be a means of achieving the means of achieving longevity and measures to solve their obstructive issues
 kintu aajkal ayurveda "pracheen bhartiya chikitsapaddati' is sankuchit arth main prayukt hota he
 The basic five physical bodies of all efforts, senses, mind and soul are called 'bodies'
 maanav sharir ke sthool rup main chah ang hai; do haath, do pair, shir or greeva ek tathaa antradhi ek
 The components of these organs are called suffixes- ayurveda ke anusaar saare sharir main 300 asthiyaan hai, jinhen aajkal keval gananaa-kram-bhed ke kaaran do sau chah maanate hai tathaa sandhiyaan 200, snaayu 900, shirayein 700, dhamniyaan 24 or unki shakhaaen 200, peshiyaan 500 tathaa sookshm strot 30,956 hai
 According to Ayurveda, the seven metals are juice, blood, meat, fattening, bone, marrow and Venus
 nityprati swaabhaavat: vividh kaaryon main upyog hone se inkaa kshay bhi hota rahata he, kintu bhojan or paan ke rup main ham jo vividh padaarth lete rahete hai unase na keval is kshati kii purti hoti he, varan dhaatuon kii pushti bhi hoti rahati he
 The food taken in the form of food matures by pachcagni, geotropic and various metals and after many changes, it turns into the aforesaid metals and nourishes these metals
 is pachankriya main aahaar kaa jo saar bhaag hota he usase ras dhaatu kaa poshan hota he or jo kitt bhaag bachataa he usase mel or mutr banataa he
 This juice reaches the whole body through the veins through the heart and provides nutrition to every metal and organ
 dhaatvagniyon se pachan hone par ras aadi dhaatu ke saar bhaag se rakt aadi dhaatuon evam sharir kaa bhi poshan hota he tathaa kitt bhaag se malon kii utpatti hoti he, jaise ras se kaph; rakt pitt; maance se naak, kaan or netra aadi ke dwaara baahar aanevaale mel; med se swead ; asthi se kesh tathaa lom or majja se aankh kaa keechad malaroop main banate hai
 Venus has no stool, oozes are produced from all its parts
 inhen rasadi dhaatuon se anek upadhaatuon kii bhi utpatti hoti he, yatha ras se doodh, rakt se conderaayein or shirayen, maance se vasa, twachaa or uske chah yaa saat str, med se snaayu, asthi se daant, majja se kesh or shukr se oj naamak upadhaatuon kii utpatti hoti he
 These metals and substrates are useful in different body functions by being located in different forms in different components
 jab tak ye uchit pariman or swaroop main rahati hai or inaki kriya swaabhaavik rahati he tab tak sharir swasth rahata he or jab ye nune yaa adhik maatra main tathaa vikrut swaroop main hoti hai to sharir main rog kii utpatti hoti he
 According to the ancient philosophical theory, all the gross matter of the world, earth, water, light, air and sky are formed by the combination of these five elements
 inke anupaat main bhed hone se hi unke bhinn-bhinn rup hote hai
 Similarly, all the metals, substrates and feces of the body are five physical
 parinamat: sharir ke samast avyav or atat: sara sharir paanchabhautik he
 These are all unconscious
 jab inamen aatma kaa sanyog hota he tab uski chetanta main inamen bhi chetana aati he
 The body starts in the mother's uterus due to the combination of pure raja and pure semen under proper conditions and the infusion of the soul in it
 ise hi garbh kehete hai
 The fetus receives nutrition from the dietary blood of the mother through the placenta and the womb, which is attached to the navel
 yah garbhodak main nimagn rahakar upasnehan dwaara bhi poshan praapt karata he tathaa pratham maas main kalal or dwitiya main ghan hota he? tisare maas main ang pratyang kaa vikaas aarambh hota he
 In the fourth month, it becomes more stable and the signs of pregnancy start to appear clearly in the mother
 is prakaar yah mata kii kukshi main uttarottar viksit hota hua jab sampurna ang, pratyang or avyavon se yukt ho jaataa he, tab praaia: nawein maas main kukshi se baahar aakar naveen praani ke rup main janm grahan karata he
 Each organ or any component in the body is formed with the purpose, that is, the accomplishment of specific functions by each element, such as holding with hands, walking with feet, eating with mouth, chewing with teeth etc
 kuch avyav aise bhi hai jinase kai kaary hote hai or kuch aise hai jinase ek vishesh kaary hi hota he
 Among those who have a particular work, there is a specific subtle structure that is empowered for that work
 isi ko indriya kehete hai
 In order to gain knowledge of these external subjects, words, touch, form, juice and smell, these components are called sensory organs, respectively, ear, skin, eye, tongue and nasal and the specific powerful subtle object in them is called sense
 ye kramash: paanch hai- Among these subtle elements, among the panchamabhutas is the characteristic of the mahabhut whose words etc
 have special properties; Such as the sky in the srotra sense for the word, the air in the sensory sense for touch, the sharp in the sensory sense for the form, the earth in the sun for the juice and the earth element in the olfactory for smell
 in paanchon indriyon ko gyanendriya kehete hai
 In addition to these, there are five concentrates for specific performance, such as legs for movement, hands for eclipse, lingua for speaking, anus and urethra for excretion and penis for childbirth
 ayurveda darshanikon kii bhanti indriyon ko aahankaarik nahin, apitu bhautik maanata he
 These senses have a tendency to be inspired by their actions
 man se sampark na hone par ye niskriy rahati he
 Every creature has a very subtle body and only one mind
 yah atyant drutagati vaala or prayek indriya kaa niyantrak hota he
 But it itself remains inactive by being unconscious without contact with the soul
 prayek vyakti ke man main satv, raj or tam, ye teenon prakritik gun hote hue bhi inamen se kisi ek kii saamanyat: prabalata rahati he or usee ke anusaar vyakti satvik, rajas yaa taamas hota he, kintu samay-samay par aahaar, aachaar evam paristhitiyon ke prabhaav se dasre gunon kaa bhi prabalya ho jaataa he
 Its knowledge is through the signs of instincts, such as raga-malice - zero realist mind is satvic, ragya, conscious and playful mind is Rajas and the mind is tamas with laziness, longevity and inactivity
 isiilie satvik man ko shuddh, satv yaa prakritik mana jaataa he or raj tathaa tam uske dosha kahe gaye hai
 By attaining consciousness from the soul, the natural or sad mind induces the senses in their respective subjects according to their qualities and according to that the bodily functions are done accordingly
 aatma man ke dwaara hi indriyon or shariravayavon ko pravrutt karata he, kyonki man hi uskaa karan he
 That is why knowledge comes from the senses with which the mind interacts, not through another
 kyonki man ek ore sookshm hota he, at: ek saath uskaa anek indriyon ke saath sampark sabhav nahin he
 Yet his pace is so rapid that he quickly changes in contact with the other senses, so that we know that he is in contact with everyone and all things are happening simultaneously, but not really Happen
 aatma panchmahabhoot or man se bhinn, chetanavan, nirvikaar or nity he tathaa sakshi swaroop he, kyonki swayan nirvikaar tathaa niskriy he
 It interacts with the active but unconscious mind, senses and body, and they are conscious
 aatma main rup, rang, akruti aadi koi chihn nahin he, kintu uske bina sharir achetan hone ke kaaran nishcesht padaa rahata he or mrit kahalata he tathaa uske sampark se hi usamen chetana aati he tab use jivit kaha jaataa he or usamen anek swaabhaavik kriyaayein hone lagati hai; jaise shwasochvas, chote se bada hona or kate hue ghaav bharna aadi, palkon kaa khulanaa or band hona, jivan ke lakshan, man kii gati, ek indriya se hue gyaan kaa duusari indriya par prabhaav hona, vibhinn indriyon or avyavon ko vibhann kaaryon main pravrutt karnaa, vishyon kaa grahan or dhaaran karnaa, swapn main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak pahunchnaa, ek aankh se dekhi vastu kaa duusari aankh se bhi anubhav karnaa
 Desire, malice, happiness, sorrow, effort, patience, intelligence, memory, ego, etc
 are only when the soul is in the body; Selfless people are not in dead bodies
 at: ye aatma ke lakshan kahe jate hai, arthath aatma kaa purvokt lakshanon se anumaan maatr kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not possible to direct it from any other senses other than mental imagination
 yah aatma nity, nirvikaar or vyapak hote hue bhi purvakrit shubh yaa ashubh karm ke parinamswaroop jaisi yoni main yaa sharir main, jis prakaar ke man or indriyon tathaa vishyon ke sampark main aati he vaise hi kaary hote hai
 Progressively inauspicious actions leads to downward progress and progress is progressively by auspicious deeds, salvation is attained when the mind is raga-malice-inferior
 is vivaran se spasht ho jaataa he ki aatma to nirvikaar he, kintu man, indriya or sharir main vikruti ho sakati he or in teenon ke paraspar saapekshya hone ke kaaran ek kaa vikaar duusare ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to keep them in a state of nature or deformed or brought into nature
 isse deergh sukh or hitayu kii prapti hoti he, jisase kramash: aatma ko bhi uske ekmaatr, kintu bheeshan, janm mrityu or bhavabandhanrup rog se mukti paane main sahaayta milti he, jo ayurveda main naitishthaki chikitsa kahi gai he
 Charaka has briefly written the symptoms of disease and healing- sushrut ne swasth vyakti kaa lakshan vistaar se diya he- If the symptoms are contrary, it should be considered unhealthy
 rog ko vikruti yaa vikaar bhi kehete hai
 Therefore, malformations in the natural form or action of body, senses and mind are diseases
 rog ke kaaran ko 'nidaan' yah paryaayi shabd aayaa he
 When a diet or vihara shows the disease on the body, then it is called diagnosis
 sansar kii sabhi vastuen saakshaat yaa parampara se sharir, indriyon or man par kisi na kisi prakaar kaa nishchit prabhaav daalati hai or anuchit yaa pratikul prabhaav se inamen vikaar utpann kar rogon kaa kaaran hoti hai
 Detailed discussion of all these is difficult, so in a nutshell they are divided into three sections: pragyaparaadh : avivek, adheeratha tathaa purv anubhav or vaastaviktaa kii upeksha ke kaaran laabh haani kaa vichaar kiye bina hi kisi vishay kaa seven yaa jaanate hue bhi anuchit vastu kaa seven karnaa
 This is also called inferior, false and excessive yoga of karma in other and clearer terms
 asatmyendriarsanyog : chakshu aadi indriyon kaa apane-apane rup aadi vishyon ke saath asatmya sanyog indriyon, sharir or man ke vikaar kaa kaaran hota he; yatha aankh se bilkul na dekhnaa, ati tejasvi vastuon kaa dekhnaa or bahut adhik dekhnaa tathaa atisookshm, sankeern, ati dur main sthit tathaa bhayanak, bibhats, evam vikrutrup vastuon ko dekhnaa 
 They also cause disorder in the mind and body along with the eye and its innate eyes
 isi ko duusare shabdon main arth kaa duryog bhi kehete hai
 Rituals like summer, rain, cold etc
 and childhood, youth and old age also have an effect on the body, etc
, but their inferiority, falsehood and non-use effect are particularly harmful
 purvokt kaarnon ke prakarantar se anya bhed bhi hote hai; yatha In contrast, they have two other differences - sharir par in sabhi kaarnon ke teen prakaar ke prabhaav hote hai : Doshapakop - Changes in any one or many of the five elements, etc
, due to many factors, it is mandatory to change their natural proportions
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar ayurvedacharyon ne in vikaron ko vaat, pitt or kaph in virgon main vibhakt kiya he
 Panchamabhuta and Tridosha are considered separately, but in short it should be understood that all the tangible substances of the world are made up of these five elements, sky, air, light, water and earth
 ye prithvi aadi ve hi nahin he jo hamen nityprati sthool jagat main dekhne ko milte hai
 These last five are the five physics generated by the combination of the aforesaid elements
 vastuon main jin tatwon kii bahulata hoti he ve unheen naamon se varnit kii jaati hai
 In the same way, the elements of which we have a lot in our body metals or in their components are counted in the same category
 in paanchon main akaash to nirvikaar he tathaa prithvi sabase sthool or sabhi kaa aashray he
 Whatever development or change happens, it clearly has an impact on it
 shesh teen sab prakaar ke parivartan yaa vikaar utpann karne main samarth hote hai
 Therefore, depending on the abundance of the three, various metals and their constituents have been labeled Vata, Pitta and Kapha
 saamaanya rup se ye teenon dhaatuen sharir kii poshak hone ke kaaran vikrut hone par anya dhaatuon ko bhi dooshit karti hai
 Therefore, due to defects and feces, it is called mal
 rog main kisi bhi kaaran se inhen teenon kii nunata yaa adhikta hoti he, jise doshapracope kehete hai
 Metal pollution - There are some substances or causes that cause disorder in a particular metal or component
 inkaa prabhaav saare sharir par nahin hota
 These are called metal pollutants
 ubhayhetu- ve padaarth jo saare sharir main vaat aadi dosha ko kupit karte hue bhi kisi dhaatu yaa ang vishesh main hi vishesh vikaar utpann karte hai, ubhayhetu kehalaate hai
 But the changes which occur in these three, vata, pitta or kapha cause disorder in any one, two or three of these three
 at: ye hi teenon dosha pradhan sharirgat kaaran hote hai, kyonki inke swaabhaavik anupaat main parivartan hone se sharir kii dhaatuon aadi main bhi vikruti hoti he
 Due to a disorder in the composition, it is also natural to have a disorder in the action
 is aswabhaavik rachana or kriya ke parinamswaroop atisar, kaas aadi lakshan utpann hote hai or in lakshanon ke samooh ko hi rog kehete hai
 In this way, the effects of which are the deformities in vata etc
 defects and Vatadi doshas, which distort physical metals, are called both for or nidana
 antat: inke do anya mahatvapurn bhedon kaa vichaar apekshit he : The means by which disorders are identified due to the aforesaid causes are called gender
 iske chaar bhed hai : purvarup, rup, samprapti or upshay
 Poorforma - The symptoms that arise due to the small or initial deformity within the body before a disease is expressed, and the possibility of origin of a particular disease is called Puroform
 rup - jin lakshanon se rog yaa vikruti kaa spasht parichay miltaa he unhen rup kehete hai
 Procreation: For which reason, which defect is caused independently or subcutaneously, singly or secondly, in how many degrees and in how much quantity, in which metal or in which organ, what kind of disorder it causes Determination is called attainment
 chikitsa main isi kii mahatvapurn upyogita he
 In fact, it is only due to these changes that diseases arise in the form of sorghum, so they can actually be called diseases as well and the treatment done with these changes is also successful
 upshay or anupashay - jab alpata yaa sankeernata aadi ke kaaran rogon ke vaastavik kaarnon yaa swaroopon kaa nirnay karne main andeh hota he, tab us andeh ke niraakaran ke liye sambhavit dosha yaa vikaron main se kisi ek ke vikaar se upyukt aahaar-vihaar or aushadh kaa prayog karne par jisase laabh hota he use upachay ke vivechan main ayurvedacharyo ne chah prakaar se aahaar-vihaar or aushadh ke prayogon kaa sutara batalaate hue upshay ke 18 bhedon kaa varnan kiya he
 These formulas are of such importance that on the basis of each of them, a medical system has emerged; like, upshay or anupashay se bhi rog kii pahchaan main sahaayta milti he
 Therefore, they too have been counted by the elders in "linga"
 hetu or ling ke dwaara rog kaa gyaan praapt karne par hi uski uchit or safal chikitsa sambhav he

 ghar main kisi kii mrityu ho jane par yah parv nahin manaaya jaataa he
 ' aisi manyata he ki chhath parv par vrath karne vaali mahilaon ko putr ratna kii prapti hoti he
 In general, women keep this fast for the want of a son and for the skill of the son
 purush bhi puri nishtha se apane manovanchit kaary ko safal hone ke liye vrath rakhte hai
 Chhath festival is basically a festival of worship of the sun, which has a special place in Hinduism
 hindu dharm ke devataaon main surya aise devtaa hai jinhen moort rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 The main sources of Sun's powers are his wife Usha and Pratyusha
 chhath main surya ke saath-saath donon shaktiyon kii sanyukt aradhana hoti he
 In the morning, both the first rays of the sun and the last rays of the sun in the evening are paid by offering arghya
 bharat main suryopasna rug vaidic kaal se hoti aa rahi he
 The Sun and its worship are discussed in detail in Vishnu Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Brahma Vaivarta Purana etc
 madhya kaal tak chhath suryopasna ke vyavasthit parv ke rup main pratishthit ho gaya, jo abhi tak chalaa aa rahaa he
 Due to the creation and rearing power, the worship of the sun started in different form at different places with the development of civilization, but the worship of the sun as a deity is first mentioned in the Rigveda
 iske baad anya sabhi vedon ke saath hi upanishad aadi vaidic granthon main isaki charchaa pramukhataa se hui he
 Yasak, the creator of Nirukta, has placed the Sun in the first place among the local gods
 uttar vaidic kaal ke antim kalkhand main surya ke maanviya rup kii kalpana hone lagi
 It later took the form of idol worship of the sun
 puranic kaal aate-aate surya puja kaa prachlan or adhik ho gaya
 Temples of Suryadev were also built in many places
 puranic kaal main surya ko aarogy devtaa bhi mana jane laga tha
 The rays of the sun were found to have the ability to destroy many diseases
 rishi-muniyon ne apane anusandhan ke kram main kisi khaas din iskaa prabhaav vishesh paaya
 Probably this is the birth of Chhath festival
 bhagwaan krishna ke pautra shamb ko kusht rog ho gaya tha
 Special Suryopasana was done to get rid of this disease, for which Brahmins were called from Shakya Island
 chhath puja kii parampara or uske mahatva kaa pratipaadan karne vaali anek puranic or lok kathaayen prachlit hai
 According to a belief, Lord Rama and Mother Sita fasted and worshiped Suryadev on Kartik Shukla Shashthi on the day of the establishment of Ram Rajya after the Lanka victory
 saptami ko suryoday ke samay punah anushthan kar suryadev se aashirwad praapt kiya tha
 According to another belief, Chhath festival started in the Mahabharata period
 sabase pehle suryaputra karn ne suryadev kii puja shuru kii
 Karna was the supreme devotee of Lord Surya
 vah pratidin ghanton qamar tak pani main khade hokar suryadev ko arghya dete the
 He became a great warrior by the grace of Suryadev
 aaj bhi chhath main arghya daan kii yahi paddati prachlit he
 Some stories also mention the worship of the Sun by Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas
 ve apane parijanon ke uttam swasthya kii kaamana or lambi umr ke liye niyamit surya puja karti thim
 According to a legend, King Priyavad had no children, then Maharishi Kashyapa made a son's sacrifice and offered his wife Malini a pudding made for Yagyahuti
 iske prabhaav se unhen putr hua parantu vah mrit paidaa hua
 Priyavad went to the crematorium with a son and his son started dying in isolation
 usee vakt brahmaji kii maanas kanya devsena prakat hui or kaha ki sristi kii mul pravriti ke chathe ansh se utpann hone ke kaaran main shashthee kehalaati hoon
 Hey! Rajan, you should worship me and inspire people to worship as well
 raja ne putr ichha se devi shashthee kaa vrath kiya or unhen putr ratna kii prapti hui
 This puja was performed on Kartik Shukla Shashthi
 chhath puja kaa sabase mahatvapurn paksh isaki saadagi pavitrataa or lokpaksh he
 This festival, full of devotion and spirituality, spreads the sweetness of folk life, consisting of bamboo-made soup, baskets, earthen pots, sugarcane juice, prasad made from jaggery, rice and wheat and sweet folk songs
 shastron se alag yah jan saamaanya dwaara apane reeti-rivaajon ke rangon main gadhi gayi upasna paddati he
 At its center is the peasant and rural life rather than scriptures like Vedas, Puranas
 is vrath ke liye na vishesh dhan kii aavashyaktaa he na purohit yaa guru ke abhyarthna kii
 If needed, it is the support of the neighborhood which is presented with pleasure and gratitude for its service
 is utsav ke liye janata swayan apane samuhik abhiyaan sangathit karti he
 The society does not look for the help of the government for the cleanliness of the cities, the management of the passing paths of the vratas, the proper arrangement of arghya donations on the banks of the pond or river
 is utsav main kharnaa ke utsav se lekar ardhyadaan tak samaaj kii anivaary upasthiti bani rahati he
 It is a monumental and grand performance of the collective work done by the common and poor people, forgetting the difficulties of their daily life, with service and devotion
 lokparv chhath ke vibhinn avasaron par jaise prasad banaate samay, kharnaa ke samay, arghya dene ke liye jate hue, arghya daan ke samay or ghat se ghar lautate samay anekon sumdhur or bhakthi-bhav se purna loakgeet gaaye jate hai
 This song mentions a parrot that is hovering near one such banana bunch
 tote ko daraaya jaataa he ki agar tum is par chonch maaroge to tumhaari shikaayat bhagwaan surya se kar di jaaegi jo tumhen nahin maaf karenge, par phir bhi tota kele ko jutha kar detaa he or surya ke coup kaa bhaagi banataa he
 But what should her Indian Sugani do now, poor thing? How to bear this disconnection? Now Suryadev cannot help him, he has destroyed the sanctity of worship

 Kanheri caves are located in the northwest of Borivali in the western region of Mumbai city
 ye sanjay gandhi rashtriya udyaan ke parisar main hi sthit hai or mukhya udyaan se 6 ki
me
 or borivali stesan se 7 ki
me
 dur hai
 These caves depict Buddhist art
 kanheri shabd krishngiri yani kaala parvat se niklaa he
 They are carved with large basalt rocks
 kanheri kaa yah girimandir mambay se lagbhag 25 mile dur salset dweep par avasthit parvat kii chattan katkar bana baudhon kaa chaityas he
 This Chaityamandir of the Hinayana sect was built at the end of the second century AD, usually in the last eras of Andhra Pradesh
 yah bana praaia: karle kii parampara main hi hai, usee kaa sa iskaa chaityas haal he, usee ke se stambhon par yugal akritiyon isamen bhi baithai gai hai
 The difference between the two is that Kanheri's art is not as life-like and gracious as Carly's
 karle kii gupha se isaki gupha kuch choti bhi he
 Then, about one third of this cave is also incomplete
 isaki bahari deevaaron par jo buddha kii murtiyan bani hai, unase spasht he ki isapar mahayan sampradaay kaa bhi baad main prabhaav padaa or hinayan upasna ke kuch kaal baad buddha bhikshuon kaa sambandh isse tut gaya tha jo gupt kaal aate-aate phir jud gaya, yadhyapi yah nayaa sambandh mahayan upasna ko apane saath liye aayaa, jo buddha or bodhisatvon kii murtiyon se prabhavit he
 Among these sculptures, a statue of Buddha is 25 feet high
 kanheri ke chaityamandir kaa plan praaia: is prakaar he - chaturdik faili vansampada ke bich bahati jaldharaayen, jinke upar uthati hui parvat kii diwaar or usamen kati kanheri kii yah gahari lambii gupha
 Outside the courtyard is surrounded by a low wall on which idols are made and through which a stairway leads to Chaityadwar
 donon ore dwarpal nirmit hai or chattani diwaar se nikali stambhon kii parampara banati chali gai he
 Some columns are also ornate
 stambhon kii sankhya 34 he or samoochee gupha kii lambaai 86 foot, chaudaai 40 foot or oonchaai 50 foot he
 Some people have also speculated the male and female idols above the pillars to be the producer couple, which is probably just a guess
 koi pramaan nahin jisase inako is chaityas kaa nirmaataa mana jaae
 Kanheri is counted among the leading Buddhist churches in western India, and its architecture imitates the craftsmanship of Karli with its gates, windows and arches
 pahaad ke aadhaar se gupha kaa drishy Cave No

 The binary number method is the local value numbering method used only by two digits
 isamen sankhya kaa maan nikaalane kaa aadhaar 2 liya jaataa he
 Since two-position electronic gates represent these numbers very easily, this method is used extensively in computer hardware and software
 dwayadhari sankhyaon ko dashamalav numberon main badalane ke ganitiya tareeke hote hai
 Under this, there are many mathematical tools that allow addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and other mathematical estimation in other methods including binaries
 dwayadhari numberon se dashamalav main ankon ko badalanaa jahaan jatil he, vahiin dwayadhari ko anya vidhiyon main antaran karnaa apekshaakrit saral hota he
 The scholar Pingal of India has used the binary number method very wisely in the description of the verses
 is prakaar pingal dwayadhari sankhya paddati kaa varnan karne vaale pratham vyakti hai
 The decimal method is simple for human use, so the initial form became the same and later on, when many methods of calculation came to the fore, the decimal method was given a prominent place
 haalanki dwayadhari bhi kaaphi had tak ek prakritik paddati he
 It was also used in many spiritual traditions, such as the Pythagoras school and the ancient Indian saint tradition
 dwayadhari paddati kaa aarambh isa purv chhathi shatabdi se mana jaataa he
 In 1854, the mathematician George Boole published a paper based on the binary method
 isi ke saath bulian algebra kii aadharshila padi thi
 In 1937, Claude Shannon laid the foundation of the Theory of Circuits on the basis of dual algebra
 1940 main binary computing kii shuruyaat bail labs complex number computer ke saath hui thi
 The value of a binary number is calculated as follows: dwayadhari paddati main nirupit sankhya ke aage yaa peeche 'kuch' jodakar yah spasht kiya jaataa he ki sankhya dwi-aadhari he 
 All the 'groups of signs' written below represent six hundred sixty-six
 kintu pehla vaala nirupan sabase adhik prachlit he
 Anything else is added to the binary bases written using 0 and 1 to avoid confusion so that its basis is clear
 is prakaar, nimnlikhit sabhi nirupan ek hi sankhya ko nirupit karte hai- When binary numbers have to be pronounced in words, they are read alphabetically so that the difference from decimal numbers can be understood
 udhaaharan ke liye, binary sankhya 100 kaa uccharan 'ek shunya shunya' karenge na ki 'ek sau'
 With this the binary nature of this number is also known and 'purity' also remains
 '100', ek sau nahin he, yah keval chaar he
 Therefore it is wrong to call it 'one hundred'
 neeche dwayadhari sankhya paddati main shunya se solah tak kii ginati diya gaya he

 lothi mata ek devi kaa naam he, jinka mandir madhyapradesh ke bhitaravar sthaan par he
 According to some popular folklore, a dancer of the Bedni Samaj, from the then Raja of Narwar, conditioned that she could be danced on a raw thread from Narwar Fort to the high hill facing the fort
 raja ne shart main apana sampurna raaj paath laga diya
 The king was allowed to cut thread with any sharp weapon
 nrutyaangna ne jaise hi nrity karte hue us paar jane kii taiyaari kii raja chintit ho uthe
 Bedney was about to reach its destination
 tabhi raja ne dhardaar hathiyaar se dhaage ko kaatna chaha
 He could not cut the thread
 usne saare dhardaar hathiyaar aajamaa liye
 It is believed that that Badni had tied the edge of all weapons with his mantra power
 unhen naakaam kar diya tha
 But a leather tool escaped the effect of spells due to being defiled by being stuck in a shoebox
 uski dhar na baandhi ja saki
 The king cut the thread from that ramp of tanners
 kile kii oonchaai se neeche girakar bedney kii mrityu ho gayi
 The place where the death of Bedney took place is probably a place where a temple is built today
 jise lodhi mata kaa mandir kaha jaataa he
 After this incident, this proverb became popular in the context of Lodhi Mata
 narvar chadhe na bedney, erch pake na eentgudnaura bhojan nahin, bundi chape na chheent
 Even today, this place is famous for visiting Lodhi Mata
 yahan desh bhar se log puja karne ke liye aate hai
 Due to this deceit with dancing, people of Bedia community still come to dance in Narwar
 narvar ke itihaas se judy asi anekon kathaayen samaaj main prachlit hai
 Historian Dr
 Manoj Maheshwari tells that, the story of Lodhi Mata is very ancient and has become very well-known in the public

 Satnam or 'satinam' is the key word used in Guru Granth Sahib
 yah mul mantra main bhi he
 Soil is composed of coarse, medium and finely organic and inorganic mixed particles on the earth's upper surface
 upree sataha par se mitti hataane par praaia: chattan pai jaati he
 Sometimes the rock is found at a slight depth
 'mrudaa vigyaan' bhautik bhugol kii ek pramukh shakha he jisamen mrudaa ke nirmaan, uski visheshtaon evam dharaatal par uske vitaran kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa hai
 Only the particles on the top surface of the earth are called soil nadiyon ke kinare tathaa pani ke bahaav se laai gai mitti jisko 'kachaar mitti' kehete hai, khodne par chattan nahin milti
 There is a source of water in the lower level
 sabhi mittiyon kii utpatti chattan se hui he
 Where nature did not manipulate the soil and the climate did not have much effect, it is possible that we could establish a gradual relationship of the soil with the rocks below
 yadhyapi upar kii sataha kii mitti kaa rang-rup neeche kii chattan se bilkul bhinn he, phir bhi donon main rasinic sambandh rahata he or yadi prakritik kriya dwaara, arthath jal dwaara bahaakar, athwa vaayu dwaara udaakar, duusare sthal se mitti nahin laai gai he, tab yah sambandh purna rup se sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 a layer above the rock can also be found that is formed from the rock itself and has not yet come into full soil by natural action, only thick pieces of rock have been formed, which can neither be called soil
 Are and not rock
 inhen kii upree sataha main mitti kii banaavat pai jaati he
 In this level of soil, we can find the accumulation of chemical and physical properties of the rock below
 yadi chattan crystalia he, to isaki sambhaavna shat pratishat pakki he
 The very proximal, lateral part of the rock below may have similar chemical and physical properties as the rock
 jaise-jaise upar kii ore duuri badhati jaaegi chattan kii ruparekha bhi badalati jaaegi
 In the end, we find the soil, which has proved to be very favorable for agriculture and on which agriculture has been going on since the beginning and man has been producing crops
 koi-koi mitti duusari jagah kii chattaanon se banakar prakritik kaarnon se aa jaati he
 In such places it is unlikely that the physical and chemical relationship of the soil above is established by the accumulation of the bottom, but it is certain that the soil originated from rocks
 kheton kii mitti main chattaanon ke khanijon ke saath-saath, ped paudhon ke sadane se, carbonic padaarth bhi paae jate hai
 The microscopic and chemical analysis shows that the wear and tear of rocks is slowly due to the effects of chemical substances found in nature
 chattaanon ke rasinic avyav badal jate hai or mitti kii ruparekha bilkul bhinn prathit hoti he
 If weeding the rock was a major activity in the formation of soil, then today we do not find the soil of fields suitable for growing plants
 mitti kii tulana pisi hui baarik chattan se nahin kii ja sakati
 Although the minerals of the rocks are found very much in the upper part of the soil and their fragments are also present in large quantities, the animal continues to have animal activities, which have proved important for agriculture
 jeevajantu tathaa unase sambandh rakhanevaale padaartho ke, jaise ped paudhon kii sadi hui vastuon or sade hue jeev jantuon ke, prabhaav se kalil avasthaa main praapt chattaanon ke chote chote kanon par pratikriya hoti rahati he or mitti kaa rang rup badal jaataa he
 This form is not just the particles of rocks, the soil is equipped with a new system of earth
 ham sookshmdarshi se mitti ke ek tukade kii pariksha karen or phir usee yantra dwaara in chattaanon ke kanon kii pariksha karen to ham donon main jameen aasmaan kaa antar paavenge
 This difference is caused by a combination of inorganic materials that are obtained from animals and plants
 prakritik kriyaaon dwaara chattaanon kaa chote-chote kanon main parivartan hone se mitti ke banane main jo sahaayta hoti he, us kriya ko apkshay kehete hai
 This action is important and it is because of this that we find the soil on the earth favorable for agriculture
 is kriya main jal, hawa main sthit oxigen, carbon dioxide, jeevanuon tathaa anya amleey rasinic dravyon se bahut sahaayta milti he
 It is believed that the soil on which natural action takes place, the water falls and the air and sunlight are in contact, it takes a form in a few years to form a variety of different color and quality soils below it
 They become staves
 yadi ham mitti kii upree sataha par 10 yaa 12 foot gaharaa gaddha khoden or mitti ke parshv kaa avlokan karen, to hamen niyamit rup se kai bhinn rup rang, rachana kii mitti ek str se duusare str tak milti jaaegi
 Scientists have considered only three major levels of it and they have also described for what reasons and under what circumstances
 jal mitti ke upree sanstar par se hote hue or bahut se rasinic dravyon ko lete hue neeche ke sanstar main jaataa he or vahaan mitti ke saath milakar anek rasinic kriyaaon dwaara mitti ke rang rup ko badal detaa he
 In this way, the matter comes from the top and gets deposited in the bed below
 inamen ek he upree sanstar, jisamen se jal dwaara vilyan hokar dravya neeche kii ore jate hai, athwa avakshepan kriya dwaara neeche ke str main jamaa ho jate hai
 We call this upper bed
 doosraa vah sanstar he, jisamen upar varnan kii gai kriya dwaara dravya aakar jamaa hote hai ise sanstar kehete hai
 The third stratum is below it, in which the soil above it is formed, it is called stratum
 is sanstar ko duusare shabdon main paitruk sanstar bhi kaha jaataa he
 This name is meaningful because the soil above this bed has originated
 is sanstar main chattan or usase bane bade-bade malbe paae jate hai
 Each bed contains different levels
 sanstaron kaa krambaddh sambandh dikhalaanaa ati kathin samasya he
 This problem was first solved by Russian scientists
 sabase kathin samasya tab prakat hoti he jab mitti ke upree sanstar kaa kuch ansh apradan dwaara cat jaataa he
 Sometimes the entire bed is eroded and the bed remains
 in sanstaron ke aantarik sambandh par jis vigyaan ke kshetra main anusandhan hota he, use mrudavigyaan kehete hai
 This science helps in the classification of soil
 yah aadhunik vigyaan he or isaki uttarotar unnati hoti ja rahi he
 It has now been proved that agriculture cannot be benefited only by knowing the physical and chemical properties of the top surface of the soil
 paudhon kii badhati ko jaanane ke liye tathaa krishakon ko salaah dene ke liye yah aavashyak he ki mitti ke vibhinn sanstaron ke bhautik or rasinic gun tathaa inkaa paraspar sambandh jaan liya jaay
 There are different types of particles in the soil
 inamen jo ausatan nune maatra ke kan hai, ve hi mitti ko urvara banane ke liye aavashyak hai
 Due to these, the formation of soil-like structure is produced
 is rachana dwaara mitti main jal avasorana kii kriya bad jaati he tathaa paudhon ke liye anya vibhinn prakaar ke khaadya padaarth bhi avashoshit hote hai
 The physical properties of soil are dependent on soil composition, heat and mineral content of the soil
 mitti ke kan bhinn-bhinn aakaar prakaar ke, koi bade to koi chote or koi ati sookshm, hote hai
 Larger particles are fragments of small stones
 jaise jaise inpar prakritik kriyaayein hoti jaati hai, bade tukade chote hote jate hai or ant main baaluu, silt, chikani mitti athwa domat mitti ke aakaar ke ho jate hai
 Larger soil particles are found in most sandy soils and smaller sized particles are found in Matiyar soils
 inhen donon aakaar ke kanon ke mishran se bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii mittiyaan banati hai or unke bhinn-bhinn bhautik gun bhi hua karte hai
 The physical properties of the soil are very closely related to agricultural science
 mitti ke kuch bhautik gun, jaise aapekshik gurutv, kanvinyas, kan aakaar,, mitti kii sughatyata or sansanjan, rang, bhaar kanantarik chhidr, samooh aadi mahatv ke hai, mitti kaa aapekshik gurutv do prakaar kaa, ek abhaasi or doosraa nirpeksh hota he
 Virtual relative gravity is achieved by the inclusion of water and air in the inner part of the soil, that is, the gravity of water and air mixed with the mineral located inside the soil
 isaliye is gurutv kii maatra nirpeksh aapekshik gurutv se kam hoti he
 This is the ratio between the weight of dry soil with a known volume and the weight of water with the same volume
 yah 1
40 se 1
68 tak hota he
 The clay and silt particles are very small and light, so they do not condense with each other
 aisi mitti kaa bhaar kam hota he
 To know the weight of soil, loam and silt, it is made dry, because different types of soil have different types of moisture
 nirpeksh aapekshik gurutv mitti ke un bhaagon se sambandh rakhata he jo khanij tatv he
 Because of this its value is high
 nirpeksh aapekshik gurutv 1
4 se 2
6 ke bich main hota he
 Clay particles form clusters
 bhinn-bhinn samooh bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii mitti utpann karte hai
 These particles are mixed with each other in different ways and their interaction is firm and orderly
 kan kisi bhi rup or aakaar ke ho sakate hai
 Soil fertility is dependent on the configuration of the particles
 paudhon ko hawa or pani kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or hawa tathaa pani kaa mitti main rahanaa kanon ke vinyas par nirbhar he
 These particle groups are- ho sakate hai
 Particle size also has an effect on other physical properties of the soil
 bade aakaar ke kanonvali mitti ke kanantarik chhidr bade hote hai
 In such soil, water flows down with great intensity, due to which there is always a lack of moisture
 aisi mitti main sheeghra garam or thanda ho jane kaa gun rahata he tathaa aisi mitti oosar hoti he
 Small mottled soils, especially clay soils, have opposite properties
 mitti ke saath jal ke milane se The presence of organic matter also leads to soil solubility
 chote-chote kanon ke kaaran sughatyata badhati he
 Eitberg has stated four stages of solubility, which depend on the amount of water
 mitti ke vibhinn kanon par ek duusare se vidyut shakti dwaara khinchaav utpann hota he, jise sansanjan kehete hai
 Cogeneration and solubility are interrelated
 ek ke adhik hone se doosraa bhi adhik ho jaataa he
 Soils have different colors
 kuch mittiyaan safed hoti he, kuch laal, kuch bhuri, kuch kaali tathaa kuch raakh ke rang kii
 Yellow soil is also found somewhere
 vibhinn dravyon kii upasthiti ke kaaran mitti main ye rang aa jate hai
 Climate of the soil also has an impact
 jahaan varsha adhik hoti he vahaan kii mitti rangeen hoti he
 Iron-clad soil is found in warm regions, whose color is brown and yellow
 louh ke oxikaran se yah rang praapt hota he
 The color of black soil is black due to the presence of organic matter and humus
 aisi mitti adhik varsha vaale sthanon main pai jaati he
 Most of the soil is made up of minerals
 aapekshik gurutv se bhaar kaa gyaan hota he
 The soil becomes light due to excess of organic matter and fossils
 mitti ke kanon ke bich kuch jagah chhuti rahati he
 These places are called particulate holes
 yah kanon ke vinyas par nirbhar karata he
 By this, the percentage of pores volume can be detected, but the shape and form of the holes is not known
 matiyaar mitti main kanantarik chhidr chote hote hai, jabaki balui mitti main ve bade hote hai
 This makes the soil soil absorb more water and the sand soil absorbs less
 pehle prakaar kii mitti keshikeey hoti he or duusare prakaar kii akeshikeey
 The soil holes have hydroelectric potential due to granular holes
 mitti kii sanrachana kanon kii sanrachana par nirbhar karti he
 Particles bind with electronegativity to form groups
 samoohon main bandh jane se bandhan or majboot ho jaataa he
 Iron and organic materials have a special hand in binding groups
 chote chote kanon ke milane se mridukan vinyas praapt hota he
 This results in more water stagnation and plowing is also more easily
 kanon ko maapkar unka vargeekaran kiya gaya he
 The measurements reveal a lot of soil properties and fertility
 yah vargeekaran antarrashtriya he: The measurement of these particles derives from a scientific equation called Stokes
 mitti main jal kaa bahut bada mahatv he
 This water is of four types: jab tak pani paryaapt rahata he, paudhe kii jad apana kaam karti rahati he
 Gradually, when the water gets depleted, then there is such a situation that the roots of the plant are unable to absorb water and the plants start drying up
 aisi avasthaa main mitti main jal bahut kam rahata he or usko mitti se preshit karne ke liye adhik maatra main shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In such a state, the water which is in the soil, it is called Mlaganigank
 isaki upyogita adhik he, kyoki isse mitti ke colloid padaarth kii maatra gyaat hoti he
 Apart from this, it also gives knowledge of the amount of inert water
 us adhiktam jal ko, jise mitti santrupt vayumandal ke kisi ek taap par avashoshit karti he, ardratagrahi gunank athwa ardrataavashoshi kshamta kehete hai
 Knowledge of hygienic coefficient is obtained as follows
 mitti main kanantarik chhidr rahete hai
 When there is no water in those holes, then air enters
