 He died in 1909
 apane gahan anusandhan or vishleshan se dutt ne dikhaaya ki british shashan na keval bharat kii bhautik sthiti sudhaarney main vifal rahaa, balki uske kaal main bharat kaa vi-udyogikaran hua
 As a result of British economic policy, India's handicrafts production fell drastically and industrial production did not increase as a compensation
 na hi bhartiya udyogon ko kisi bhi tarah kaa sangrakshan pradaan kiya gaya
 As a result, the Indian economy was forced to depend on agriculture more than ever before
 bhartiya samaaj kaa dehathikaran hota chalaa gaya
 Dutt said that India did not benefit from the perceived constructive steps of British colonialism
 angrezon dwaara shuru kiye gayi rail- parivahan ke kaaran parmparik parivahan sevaayen maari gayin or trainon kaa istemaal british kaarakaanon main bane maal kii dhulaai ke liye hota rahaa
 Dutt concluded that the Indian economy is not underdeveloped, but its growth has been stunted
 unke dwaara likhaa gaya itihaas vidwaanon ke ek hisse main prachlit us marxvaadi dharna ko jhuthlaata he jiske mutabik british upniveshwaad kii bhoomika pragatisheel tehraayi jaati he
 Apart from economic historian Ramesh Chandra Dutt was also a talented and skilled cultural historian
 bangeey sahitya parishad ke sansthaapak adhyaksh rahane ke saath-saath unhone mahabharat or ramayana kaa angrezi main sankshipt kavyanuwaad bhi kiya
 Based on the evidence of Sanskrit literature, Dutt also composed the history of ancient civilization of India
 british aarthik niti ke dushprinaamon par prakaash daalane ke alaava aarthik vichaaron ke vikaas main dutt kaa doosraa pramukh yogadan yah tha ki unhone arthvyavastha main sarkari hastkshep kii seemaa nirdhaarit karne kii vakaalat kii
 He recommended this in the early twentieth century at a time when other Indian economists were seeking to reduce the government's interference in economic life
 dutt kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar ko nijee pahalakadami ghataane vaale hastkshepon se bachanaa chahie, lekin khaas paristhitiyon main dakhsandaazi ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie taaki asthai kism ke sankaton se bachate hue hiton kaa takaraav taala ja sake
 Dutt's method of estimating the reality was also different in that era
 vaastaviktaa ke anek kaarnon main ek ko pramukh or dusron ko uskaa prabhaav maan kar chalane ke bajaay dutt ne aarthik or raajnneetik tathyon kii paraspar nirbharta kii avadharana viksit kii
 He believed that everything in the system of society is interdependent, interconnected, so nothing should be done like disturbing the balance
 lekin, saath main dutt yah bhi samajhate the ki santulan hameshaa ek jaisaa nahin rahata he
 He is constantly changing
 isliye sarkaar ko hastkshep karte samay kii fori sthiti kii antarnihit gatishiltaa par apana dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie, varanaa uske hastkshepkaaree kadamon kaa parinaam vipareet bhi nikal saktaa he
 The publication of Dutt's works on economics began in 1900
 unki pehali pustak thi bharat main padane vaale akalon kaa adhyayan karne vaali 'femins and land acesment in india' jisaki saraahna roosi araajaktaavaadi darshanik prince kropatakin ne bhi kii thi
 His work showed how interested he was in the living conditions of the Indian farmer and how his economic thinking was focused on improving his condition
 dutt ne sawaal uthaaya ki 1858 ke baad se chalis saal kii avadhi main bharat kii janata ko das bheeshan akalon kaa saamana kyon karnaa padaa? unhone poocha ki is dauraan hukumat east india company ke bajaay samraji ke haath main thi
 During this time there was usually peace and only one war took place
 hukumat ke paas prashikshit prashaasak the jinhen bhartiya paristhitiyon kaa paryaapt anubhav tha
 The land was fertile, farmers were entrepreneurs and economists
 aisi anukool paristhitiyon ke baavjood aisa kyon hua ki in akalon ke dauraan kareeb dedh karod log bhukh ke shikaar ho kar jaan se haath se dho baithe? dutt yah maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hue ki akalon kaa kaaran aabaadi main tej rakrataar se hui badhotaree he yaa bharat ke kisaan laaparvaah, kahil or fizoolsearch hai
 He also did not accept that farmers being trapped under the clutches of usurers could be the cause of famine
 dutt ne apane adhyayan main dikhaaya ki bharat main aabaadi badhane kii raftaar england ke mukaable na keval hameshaa kam rahi, balki unke adhyayan se pehle ke das varshon main is desh kii aabaadi main badhotaree ruk hi gayi thi
 According to Dutt, more hardworking and less spending farmers than India are nowhere else in the world
 unhone akaal ke kaarnon kii jaanch karne vaale aayogon kii rapaton kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki sarkari rajasav kii kathortapurvak vasuuli ke kaaran hi kisaanon ko mahajanon par nirbhar hona padataa he
 Showing a mirror to the British government, Dutt demonstrated that despite the famine, there was no year when all the crops had fallen
 sarkari godaamon main anaaj hameshaa bharaa rahaa
 If the crop in one province has deteriorated, the crop has been good in another province
 kheti kaa vistaar hua he, vah saghan bhi hui he, pehle ke mukaable paidaavaar bhi badi he, khetihar upaj kii keemten bhi badi hai, par iske baad bhi kisaanon kii haalat lagaataar karaab hoti gayi he
 Dutt blamed British policies for this
 1902 main dutt ke mahaan granth 'da iconomic history of british india' kaa pehla khand prakashit hua
 It is known as the best text written on British rule
 isamen 1757 main angrezon kii satta kii sthapana se lekar samraji kii hukumat lagu hone tak kaa aarthik itihaas pesh kiya gaya tha
 It had an analytical account of policies related to farming and land settlement, trade and factory production policies as well as finance and administration policies adopted under the East India Company
 pustak ke british samikshakon ne bhi isaki nishpakshta or gaharaai kaa loha mana
 In 1904, the second volume of this epic was published
 unhone pramanik tathyon ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ki british shashan ke praarambhik varshon main apanaayi gayi swarthpurna nitiyaan bhartiya udyogon ke patan ke liye zimmedaar rahi hai
 Dutt, highlighting the causes of poverty in India, proved that the British industry had to destroy the indigenous industries and handicrafts
 lakhon log berojgaar ho gayi jisase jivan-yaapan ke liye unke saamne kheti ke alaava koi or chaara nahin rah gaya
 In this way, the number of people living on the basis of agriculture increased and the standard of living of all fell
 iske saath-saath angrez bharat par hukumat karne ke liye baari dhan karchate rahe jiskaa mulk ko koi faaydaa nahin pahunchaa
 The fiscal policy and the land revenue system were made in such a way that only the surviving resources remained with the farmer
 dutt ke paas in samasyaon kaa ilaaj karne kaa nuskhaa bhi tha
 He recommended that the excise duty should be removed from the Indian mill industry, farmers should be rid of all taxes other than the soft taxation of low rates, military and royal expenditure in England should not be recovered from India and also in India Expenses should be reduced dutt ne jaise hi ye suzav diye, british hukumat or uske himytiyon ne unki chautarfa aalochana shuru kar di
 An attempt was made to dismiss his facts and analysis
 dhyaan rahe ki dutt indian civil services ke varisht adhikari the or british shashan kii seva karne ke daayitv se bandhe hue the
 However, he continued to argue with his opponents and urged the government to change the policies to improve India's economic condition
 inaki vilakshan pratibha keval prashasnic kaaryon tak hi simit nahin thi, varan ye moulik lekhak tathaa itihasajna bhi the
 At the beginning of his writing, he wrote in English, but later also composed in Bengali with the influence of Bankim Chandra

 File transfer protocol is a network protocol through which files are exchanged over an Internet-based TCP / IP network
 ise upayokta aadhaarit kuta yaa anonimas yujar acces ke dwaara kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Now with FTP servers in almost every institution, this system does not work
 anek haal ke web broujar or file prabandhak apatpi sarvaron se jud sakate hai
 This can do the same thing as local files on files coming from remote locations
 isamen apatpi yuarel prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Other methods of sending files such as SFTP and SCP are not associated with FTP
 inaki puri prakriya main esaech kaa prayog hota he
 The File Transfer Protocol or FTP in its current form has arrived at various stages
 sarvapratham 16 april, 1971 main ise refsi 114 ke naam se taiyaar kiya gaya tha jise baad main june, 1980 main refsi 765 se badla gaya jise san aktubar 1985 main refsi 959 se parivartit kiya gaya
 After that, many security related changes came
 ye suraksha sambandhi badlaav isliye laae gaye the kyonki aarambh main sanchikaayen bhejne kaa yah tarika bahut asurakshit tha
 The main reason for this vulnerability was that anyone could steal or copy that file on the same network in the process of sending the file
 achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet se purv yah internet protocol ke kaaryakshetra main aane vaali ek aam samasya bani hui thi
 This problem was possible only through SFTP
 apatpi ko sakriy mod, niskriy mod or vistrut niskriy mod main sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 In September 1998 by RFC 2428, extended passive mode was added
 network par data antarit karte samay, kai data pratinidhitiv kiye ja sakate hai
 There are two most common transfer modes: FTP sarwar vaapasi code, apane bheetar ke ankon dwaara apni sthiti suchit karte hai
 The basic FTP specification is an inherently unsafe method of transferring files, as there is no specified method of transferring data in an encrypted manner
 iskaa arth yah he ki adhikansh network vinyason ke antargat, prayokta naam, password, afatipi cmand or antarit sanchikaayen, ek packet sansuchak ke upyog dwaara usee network par avasthit koi bhi antarit sanchikaon ko hathiyaa saktaa he
 This has been a common problem for many Internet protocol specifications written prior to the creation of SSL such as HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet
 is samasya ke liye aam samaadhaan he esaftipi, yaa apatpies, jo arefasi 4217 main vinirdisht tareeqe se afatipi main esasail yaa tles ancripshan jodate hai
 a host providing FTP service is additionally capable of providing anonymous FTP access
 prayokta naam ke liye puche jane par, prayokta saamaanya taur par 'anaam' khate kii seva main log-in karte hai
 Although users are generally asked to send their e-mail address in lieu of a password, little or no verification of the supplied information is done
 chunki aadhunik afatipi client aam taur par prayokta se anaam pravesh prakriya ko chhupate hai, afatipi client, password ke rup main nakli data kii aapurti kar sakate hai kyonki anuprayog ko prayokta kaa i-mail pataa gyaat nahin ho saktaa he
 The Gopher protocol, as well as the simple file transfer protocol and file service protocol, have been suggested as an alternative to anonymous FTP
 jahaan apatpi acces prayog main nahin aata, vahaan doorvarti yaa remote apatpi yaa apatpi mail prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this, an email is sent to another FTP server that completes the FTP command and sends back an attachment containing the download file
 yah khaskar vahaan prayog main laayaa jaataa he, jahaan FTP pahunch pratibandhit ho
 An e-mail containing the FTP command to be executed is sent to the remote FTP server
 yah ek mail sarwar hota he jo aavak i-mail ko pars karata he, afatipi commandon ko karyanvit karata he or atachament ke rup main downlod kiye gaye kisi sanchika ke saath i-mail waapas bhejtaa he
 This is obviously less flexible than an FTP client, as directories cannot be seen interacting or modifying commands, and replies may also have problems with large file attachments escaping through the mail server
 aajkal adhikansh internet prayoktaaon ke paas afatipi kaa pahunch sulabh he, atah yah prakriya dainandin upyog main prachlit nahin he
 Currently modern and recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers, although they may lack support for protocol extensions such as FTPS
 yah afatipi par doorvarti sanchikaon kii adla-badali main sthaneey sanchikaon ke liye prayukt interfes jaise madhyam ko anumat karata he
 This is done by an FTP URL
 yah is rup main hota he: Alternatively a password can be provided in the URL, eg: adhikansh web brouzaron ko niskriy mod afatipi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jisase puraa karne hetu sabhi afatipi sarwar sakasham nahin hai
 Some browsers only allow files to be downloaded, but do not provide any means to upload files to the server
 ypi pate or port cmand par port sankhyaon kaa pratinidhitiv or pieesavi uttar, network pataa anuwaad upkarnon ke liye FTP se nipatane main ek or chunauti he
 These values have to be changed by the NAT tool, so that they include the IP address of the nat-ed client and the port selected by the NAT device for the data connection
 nayaa pataa or port sambhawatah unke dashamalav pratinidhitiv kii lambaai main apane mul pate or port se alag hon
 This means that the value on the control connection must be carefully changed, with the NAT tool changing the TCP sequence and acknowledgment fields for all subsequent packets
 adhikansh NAT upkarnon main aam taur par is tarah ke anuwaad nahin kiye jate hai, balki is uddeshy ke liye vishesh anuprayog stareey get-ve uplabdh rahete hai
 FTP over SSH refers to the use of creating a normal FTP session container over an SSH connection
 afatipi ek se adhik tisipi conekshnon kaa upyog karata he, atev esaech par tunnel bananaa vishesh rup se kathin hota he
 As with many SSH clients, attempting to prepare the tunnel for the control channel would only protect the channel; When data is transferred, FTP software on both ends will establish TCP connections, which will pass over the SSH connection to the bypass, thus securing privacy, integrity protection, etc
 anyathaa, esaech client software ke liye afatipi protocol kaa vishisht gyaan or afatipi niyantran sandeshon kii nigaraanee or punarlekhan tathaa swytt rup se afatipi data channelon ke liye nae agreshan kholana aavashyak hota zaruri he
 Version 3 of SSH Communications Security's software parikar and FONC licensed by GPL are two software packages that support this mode
 SSH kii apeksha FTP ko kabhi-kabhi surakshit FTP ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he; ise FTP surakshit karne kii SSL / TLS jaisi anya paddati nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Other methods of transferring files using SSH include SFTP and SCP, which are not related to FTP; In each of these, the entire conversation is always protected by the SSH protocol

 nadir shah afshaar faras kaa shah tha or usne sadiyon ke baad kshetra main irani prabhutaa sthapit kii thi
 He started his life from slavery and did not become the Shah of Persia, but he drove the powerful enemy Osmani Empire and the Russian Empire out of Iranian territories at that time
 usne afshari vansh kii sthapana kii thi or uskaa udai us samay hua jab iran main pashchim se osmani samrajya kaa akraman ho rahaa tha or purab se afagaanon ne safaavi rajdhani isiahaan par adhikaar kar liya tha

 After that he became immensely powerful and his health also deteriorated
 apane jivan ke uttarardh main wo bahut atyaachaari ban gaya tha
 After his assassination in 1747, his empire soon disintegrated
 nadir kaa janm khorasaan main afshaar qazalbus kabeeley main ek saadhaaran parivaar main hua tha
 Her father was an ordinary farmer, who died during the childhood of Nadir
 nadir ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki uski maan ko uske saath uzbekon ne das bana liya tha
 But Nadir was able to escape and he joined an officer clan and within a few days became the head of one of his sections
 jald hi wo ek safal sainik ke rup main ubhara or usne ek sthaneey pradhan baba ali beg kii do betiyon se shaadi kar lee

 He loved horse riding and was very fond of horses
 uski awaz bahut gambheer thi or ye bhi uski safalataa kii kai vazahon main se ek mana jaataa he
 He was a Turkmen and his clan had greatly assisted the Safavis since the time of Shah Ismail I
 us samay faras kii gaddi par safaviyon kaa shashan tha
 But Nadir Shah's future was not due to Shah's coup which is often with many successful generals
 usne safaviyon kaa saath diya
 At that time, Safavi was very happy to find Nadir Shah in his decadent empire
 ek taraf se osmani samrajya to duusari taraf se afagaanon ke vidroh ne safaviyon kii naak main dam kar rakhaa tha

 It was an honor because it gave him the royal name

 tahmaashp ke darbar main apni sthiti sudrudh karne ke baad usne 1729 main rajdhani isiahaan par kabza kar chuke afagaanon par akraman karne kii yojana banaai

 usne bayaan kiya - nadir abhyaas kshetra main ghusane ke baad apane senapatiyon ke abhivadan kii sweekruti main apana sar jhukaata tha
 After that he used to stop his horse and observe the army silently for some time
 wo abhyaas aarambh hone kii anumati detaa tha
 After this the practice started - chakra, array of composition and horse riding etc 

 Nadir himself practiced on horse for three hours
 san 1729 ke ant tak usne afagaanon ko teen baar haraaya or isiahaan waapas apane niyantran main le liya
 He allowed the Afghans to flee safely
 iske baad usne baari sainya abhiyaan kii yojana banaai
 For which he forced Shah Tahmashp to collect the tax

 His military success was not seen from Tehmashp

 He resumed the war with the Osman with the aim of proving his military worthiness, which ended up embarrassing him and he had to return some of the territories Usman had won
 nadir jab heraat se lautaa to yah dekhakar kshubdh hua
 He sought his support from the public

 At the time of his coronation, Nadir announced that he would defeat the rulers of Kandahar, Delhi, Bukhara and Istanbul
 darbar main upasthit logon ko laga ki yah charam atmapravanchanaa ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 But in time to come, he came to know that it was not so
 usne pashchim kii disha main osmanon par akraman ke liye sena taiyaar kii
 But he was defeated in his first attack
 osmanon ne baghdad kii raksha ke liye ek baari sena bhej di jiskaa nadir koi jabaab nahin de paaya
 But within a few months he reorganized the army
 is baar usne kirkuk ke paas osmanion ko haraa diya
 In June 1735 near Yerevan he defeated the Osmanis once again with the help of the Russians
 is samjhaute ke tahat roosi bhi farsi pradeshon se waapas kooch kar gaye
 Nadir declared himself Shah in 1736 in front of his generals, governors and many supporters

 The Safawis were Shia and under them the Shia people got rid of the atrocities of the Arabs
 aaj iran kii janata shiya he or vahaan shuruaati teen khalifaaon ko gaali dene kii parampara he
 Nadir Shah, while holding his throne, placed a condition that people would give up this disrespect towards those Caliphs
 isse use faaydaa bhi mila
 Shia Sunni tension in Iran not only decreased but at the same time Iran was seen as another center of Islam
 nadir armeniyon ke saath bhi udaar dharmik sambandh rakhata tha
 His rule was a time of peace for the Jews as well
 apane samrajya ke andar usne sunni mazahab ko janata par ladane kii koi koshish nahin ki lekin samrajya ke baahar wo sunni parivartit rajya ke shah ke rup main janaa jane laga
 It began to be compared to the Osmani empire, which was the Surveyor of Islam at that time

 After capturing Kabul, he invaded Delhi
 karnal main mughal raja mohammad shah or nadir kii sena ke bich ladaai hui
 In this, Nadir's army was smaller than the Mughals, but the Persian army won because of its landmines
 uske march 1739 main dilli pahunchne par yah afawaah faili ki nadir shah maaraa gaya
 This caused a stampede in Delhi and the Persian army was killed
 usne iskaa badla lene ke liye dilli main bhayanak khoonkhraba kiya or ek din main koi 20,000 - 22,000 log maar die
 Apart from this, he also took a lot of money from Shah
 mohammad shah ne sindhu nadi ke pashchim kii sari bhoomi bhi nadir shah ko daan main de di
 He was also presented with a volley of diamond jewels which included Cohenoor, dariya-noor and taj-e-mah, each with their own bloody story
 nadir ko jo smapda mili wo kareeb 70 karod rupayon kii thi
 This amount was comparable to the erstwhile Seven Year War in which the French government gave the Austrian government
 nadir ne dilli main samrajya vistaar kaa lakshya nahin rakhaa
 His aim was to collect the necessary funds for his army which he got
 kaha jaataa he ki dilli se lautne par uske paas itnaa dhan ho gaya tha ki agle teen varshon tak usne janata se kar nahin liya tha
 On his return from Delhi, he learns that his son Raza Quli, whom he had made as the voicerai in his absence, has killed Safavi Shah Tahamashap and Abbas
 isse usko bhanak mili ki raza uske kilaaf bhi shadyantra rach rahaa he
 With this fear, he removed Raza from the Viceroy
 iske baad wo turkestan ke abhiyaan par gaya or uske baad dagestan ke vidroh ko daman karne niklaa
 But he did not get success here
 lezgon ne khandak yuddh niti apanaai or rashad ke kaaravaan par akraman kar nadir ko pareshaan kar daalaa
 While he was in Dagestan, Nadir received the news that Raza was planning to kill him
 isse wo kshubdh hua or usne raza ko andhaa kar diya
 Raza said that she is innocent but Nadir did not listen to her
 lekin kuch hi din baad nadir ko apni galati par khed hua
 By this time Nadir had fallen ill and was very upset to blind his son
 nadir shah ne aadesh diya ki un saradaaron ke sir uda die jaayen jinhone uske bete raza quli kii ankhen phodi jate dekha he
 Nadir Shah blamed the chieftains for why none of them said that his eyes should be blown instead of Raza Quli
 dagestan kii asafalataa bhi use khaae ja rahi thi
 Gradually he became more tyrannical
 usne dagestan se khaali haath waapas lautne ke baad usne apni sena ek bahut puraane lakshya ke liye phir se sangathit kii - pashchim kaa osmani samrajya
 At that time when the army was organized it was counted as 3,75,000 soldiers

 He did not face much opposition except in cities
 kirkuk par uskaa adhikaar ho gaya lekin baghdad or basra main use safalataa nahin mili
 His ambition came to an end in Mosul and he had to compromise with Osman
 nadir ko ye samaj main aayaa ki osmani uske niyantran main nahin aa sakate
 New Usmani troops were sent against him
 nadir shah ke bete nasirullah ne inamen se ek ko haraaya jabaki nadir ne yerawan ke nikat 1745 main ek duusare jatthe ko haraaya
 But this was his last big victory

 Nadir's end was beset by his illnesses
 vah dinanudin biimaar, atyaachaari or kattar ho chalaa tha
 In his last days he imposed heavy taxes on the public and even started demanding money from his close relatives
 uskaa sainya kharch kaafii bad gaya tha
 His nephew, Ali Quli, refused to obey his orders
 19 june 1747 main mashhad ke nikat uske apane hi angrakshakon ne uski hatya kar daali
 Nadir Shah's achievements could not last long
 uske marane ke baad ali quli ne swayan ko shah ghoshit kar diya
 He named his name Adil Shah
 nadir ke marane ke baad sena teetar bitar ho gai or samrajya ko kshatrapon ne swatantra rup se shashan karnaa shuru kar diya
 European influence also increased
 nadir ko europe main ek vijeta ke rup main khyaati mili thi
 In 1768, Christian VII of Denmark ordered Sir William Jones to translate his biography written by Persian historian Mirza Mahdi Astarabadali into Persian from French
 1739 main uski bharat vijay ke baad angrezon ko mughalon kii kamazori kaa pataa chalaa or unhone bharat main samrajya vistaar ko ek mauka samaj kar damakham lagaakar koshish kii

 Each flower has its own special type of structure to encourage pollen
 kiliestogamas phool swaparagit hote hai, jiske baad ve khul bhi sakate hai yaa shaayad nahin bhi
kai prakaar ke viola or salvi prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Insectivorous flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another
 saamanytah phulon ke anek bhaagon main ek granthi hoti he jise paraag kaha jaataa he jo in kiton ko aakarshith karti hai
 Some flowers have structures called madhursa instructions that tell pollinators where to find honey
 phool paragakon ko khushboo or rang se bhi aakarshith karte hai
 Yet some flowers mimic or imitate to attract pollinators
 udhaaharan ke liye kuch orchid kii prajatiyaan phool srujit karti hai jo kii maadaa madhumakhi ke rang, aakaar or khushboo se mail khate hai
 Flowers are also experts in forms and stamens have such an arrangement that it is ensured that the pollen grains are transferred to the pollinator when it lands on its attracting Vastu
 However, the pollen transfers the pollen to the pistil in all the flowers that are arranged exactly equally
 vaataparageet phool vaayu kaa istemaal paraag ko ek phool se agle phool tak le jane main karte hai udahaaran ke liye ghaasein, santi vriksh, emborsia jati kii raig ghans or esar jati ke ped or jhaadiyaan

 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 phool-paudhe dwichhidranviy hote hai jo ki do prakaar ke chhidron kaa srijan karte hai
 Pollen and ovules are formed in separate organs, but a typical flower bears bisporangiate strobilus that has both organs
 phool ko ek sanshodhit tana kaha jaataa he, chote internodon or bering ke saath, iske nodes aise sanrachit hote hai jo kii ati sansodhit pattey ho sakate hai
 In short, the structure of a flower is on a modified stem on an anterior meristem, which does not grow continuously
 Flowers are attached to the plant in some ways
 yadi phool tane se jude nahin hote or unka nirmaan paton par hota he to unhen avrint kaha jaataa he jab phool kaa pushpan hota he, to use ek phuleey pushpan kaha jaataa he
 If the flowering flower ends in clusters of flowers, then each trunk that carries the flower is called pedicel
 pushpan vaala tana ek antak rup srujit karata hai jise phool kii kursi yaa uskaa patr kehete hai phool ke hisse patr ke upar vorl main vyavasthit hote hai
 The four main parts of the whorl are as follows: yaddapi upar varnit phulon kii sanrachana ko 'adarsh' sanrachanaatmak yojana mana ja saktaa he, parantu paudhon kii jati is yojana se hatakar badlaav ke vyapak bhinnata ko dikhaate hai
 These changes are very important in the development of flowering plants and botanists use it intensively to establish the relationship between plant species
 masalan phool-paudhon ki do upjatiyaan kaa bhed unke prayek vorl ke phuleey ango ko lekar ho saktaa he: ek dwibipatri ke vorl main adarsh rup main chaar yaa paanch ang hote hai or monocoteledon main teen yaa teen ke gunank vaale ang hote hai
 a group pistil may have only two carpels, or may not be related to the generalization of monocots and dicots given above
 jaisaa ki upar varnit kiya gaya he ki vyaktik phulon ke zyaadaatar naslon main jayang or punkesar dona hote hai
 Botanists describe these flowers as complete, bisexual, hermaphrodite
 phir bhi kuch paudhon ki naslon main phool apurna yaa ek lingeey hote hai: yaa to keval punkesar yaa strikesar angon ko dhaaran kiya hue
pehle maamle main agar ek vishesh paudha jo ki yaa to maadaa yaa purush he to aisi nasl ko dioisius mana jaataa he
 But if a sexual male or female flower appears on the same plant, such a species is called monoecious

 In species where there is more than one flower at the same peak, which is also called a joint flower - a collection of such flowers is also known as inflorescence, with the term having a specific arrangement on the stem of the flower

 Eg rose or trillium
 When the flowers divide and form only a line that forms the components, such flowers are irregular or zygomorphic eg snapdragon / majus or mostly orchids
 ek phool kaa formula, ek tarika he jisase ek phool kii sanrachana kaa pratinidhitiv ek vishesh akshar, ank yaa pratik ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Instead of a particular species, a general formula is used to indicate the flowering structure of a plant family

 Flowers are reproductive organs that mediate sperm from linking pollen to the ovule / testicles, normally from one plant to another, but many plants can pollinate their own flowers

 Sexual reproduction produces unique offspring, ready to adapt
 phulon kii ek vishisht sanrachana hoti he jo kii unhen ek hi nasl ke paraag ko ek paudhe se dusre paudhe main sthantarit karne ke liye prerit karti he
 Many plants depend on external factors for the transfer of pollen between flowers, including air and animals, especially pests
 Very large animals such as birds, bats, and dwarf poses can also be employed / employed / used
 The period of time in which this process takes place is called anthesis
 ko aakarshith karti hai
 Plants cannot move from one place to another, so many flowers grow in a dispersed population to attract animals to transfer pollen to each flower
 phool jo ki kit-paraagit hote hai unhen kitapargeey kaha jaataa hai jo kii latin main kit-premi ke rup main liya jaataa he
 These can be significantly modified with insects pollinated by co-development, usually in different parts of the flower there are glands called sweet organs that attract animals that are looking for nutritious sweet
 pakshiyon or madhumakhiyon main rang drushti hoti he, jo ki unhen "rangile" phool dhundne main yogya banaate hai
 Some flowers have madhuras directors / directives that show pollinators looking for madhuras, which can only be seen in ultraviolet light, which is visible only to bees and insects
 phool paraagan kartaaon ko gandh or kuch gandh hamaare soonghney kii shakti ke liye bhi sukhad hote hai
 The smell of all flowers does not appeal to humans, many flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh, and flowers that smell like dead animals, often called carrion flowers, include reflexia, titanarum and Paupau of North America
 phool jo ki raat ke aagantukon dwaara paraagit hote hai, sambhavit he ko ve paraagan kartaaon ko aakarshith karne ke liye apane gandh par dhyaan kendrit karte hai aise phool zyaadaatar safed hote hai
 Still others use mimicry to attract pollinators, for example the flowers of some species of some orchids match the color, shape and fragrance of bees
 nar madhumakhi aise hi phulon main se ek phool se dusre phool par saathi kii talash main ghoomte rahete hai
 The mechanism of pollination by the plant depends on how pollination is used
 adhikansh phool apane paraagan ke tareeke ko lekar mote taur par do samoohon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 Insectivorous: Flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another
 zyaadaatar ve aakaaron / roopon main visheshgy hote hai or punkesar kii aisi vyavastha hoti he ki yah sunishchit ho jaataa he ki paraag ke daanen paraagan par sthaanantarit ho jaayen jab vah apane aakarshith vastu par utarataa he kai phulon kii ek hi prajati ke is aakarshneey vastu ko paane ke liye, paragankarta un sabhi phulon main paraag ko stigma main sthantarit kar detaa he jo kii bilkul sateek rup se samaan rup main vyavasthit hote hai
 Many flowers rely only on the proximity between the parts of the flower for pollination
 anya jaise kii sarasenia yaa maadaa sleeper orchid ke paas i sunishchit dhaancha hota he jo ki aatmaparagan kaa nirodh karte hue paraagan ko nishchit karata he
 Aphrodisiac flowers: Use of air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, rag grasses of Amboria species and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators due to which they do not have a tendency to 'showy flowers'
 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 Bees and bumblebees actively accumulate aerated pollen corns, although they are not of much importance
 kuch phool swaparagit hote hai or un phulon kaa istemaal karte hai jo kabhi nahin khilte, yaa phool khilne se pehle swaparagit jo jate hai, in phulon ko clisotogamas kaha jaataa he kai prakaar ke viola or salvia prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific types of bacteria
 udahaaran ke liye kai phool ek vishisht keet jati se keval ek keet ko hi aakarshith karte hai, atah safal prajnan ke liye keval us keet par nirbhar karte hai
 This close relationship is often taken as an example of coexistence, as flowers and pollinators are believed to grow over a long period to match each other's needs

 In such a relationship, the deletion of even one means that the deletion of almost the other member also
 The reason for some endangered plant species is a decrease in the population of dying pollinators

 Extreme cases of self-fertilization occur in flowers that are always self-fertile, such as many miscreants
 In contrast, many plant breeds have their own ways of preventing self-fertilization

 aam dharna yah he ki prarambh se hi phulon kaa kaary, pashuon ko prajnan prakriya main shaamil karnaa rahaa he
 Pollen can disintegrate even without bright / golden and clear appearance, so it becomes an obligation to use the plant's resources until it provides no other benefit
 a proposed reason for the sudden presence of fully grown flowers is that they have evolved in a different environment, such as an island or chain of islands, where the plants that held them had a highly specialized relationship with certain animals
 Have evolved from, as in present-day / today, insular breeds / ethnicity

 Likewise, many fruits that are used in the reproduction of the plant come from the expansion of the parts of the flower, often the fruit is a device that depends on the animals that want to eat it, thus scattering those seeds
 Who are in that fruit

 Being in Australia, it is named Australian Open
 isaki shuruwat prayek varsh janvari maah hoti he
 The tournament began in 1905 at the Weerhausman Cricket Ground
 It was named the Australasian Championships because by 1912 it was organized by both Australia and New Zealand
 The competition was only expanded to include women's tennis in 1922
 Due to the geographical distance separating it from the other tournaments, the top American and European players rarely deigned to travel down to the Antipodes until the end of the 1970s, meaning that the title was almost exclusively won by Australians up until that date
 In 1972, The Australian Tennis Federation decided to change the venue of the event every year, with Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and even New Zealand taking turns to host the tournament
 In 1983, the Australian Open set up home in Kooyong, Melbourne, where it began to earn the respect of the tennis-playing world until its move in 1988 to Flinders Park
 Grass courts made way for hard Rebound Ace surfaces, and in 1997, Flinders Park was renamed Melbourne Park
 Since 1988, the Australian Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to have two courts covered by retractable roofs

 It was again re-commissioned by the Education Department of the Government in 1979 by 'dr
 Ambedkar's entire writing and speech was published in eleven parts

 Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar has mentioned that to know his thinking of Buddhism, it is necessary to read his three books
 pramukh pustak bhagwaan buddha or unka dhamm, or anya do pustaken hai: buddha or karl marks; or bharat main kranti or pratikranti
 An idol of Babasaheb is installed in a Buddhist monastery in Britain, and there is a book 'lord Buddha and His Dhamma' in Babasaheb's hand

 Indian Buddhists are extremely devoted to this pious work
 sabbe satta sukhi hontu
 Dr
 Ambedkar's aim to write a treatise: is kitaab ko likhane ke liye aagrah karata hum ki ek alag mul he
 In 1951, the editor of the Journal of the Mahabodhi Society of Calcutta asked me to write an article for the Vaishakh number
 us lekh main maine tark diya ki buddha kaa dharm hi dharm he jo ek samaaj vigyaan se jaagaa sweekaar kar saktaa tha, or jiske bina yah naash hoga
 i have also pointed out that Buddhism is the right religion for the modern world which it should have been to protect itself
 yahi kaaran he ki buddha dharm kaa tathy yah he ki, buddha dharm kaa sahitya itnaa vishaal he ki koi bhi iske bare main puraa pard nahin sakate he, yahi vajah se dhimi gati se agrim he banaata he
 It is not such a thing as a Bible that Christians have, its biggest obstacle
 is lekh ke prakaashan par, main kai kol, likhit or maukhik, is tarah ke ek kitaab likhane ke liye praapt kiya
 It is in response to these says that i have done the work
 pustak sawaal buddha dharm chehre ke aadhunik chaatro ke liye ek jawaab ke rup main likhaa he
 At the beginning, four questions listed outside the author: pehali samasya buddha, arthath, parivraja ke jivan main mukhya ghatana se sambandhit he
 Why did Buddha take Parivraja? The traditional answer is that he took care of the family because he saw a dead person, a sick person and an old person
 is sawaal kaa jawaab ise chehre par betuka he
 Buddha took Paribraja at the age of 29, so he took Parivraja as a result of these three places, how has he not seen these three places before? These have been common events occurring by the hundreds, and Buddha could not have failed to come across them earlier
 yah paramparaagat spashtikaran sweekaar karte hai ki yah pehali baar vah unhen dekha tha asambhav he
 The explanation is not plausible and does not appeal to the cause
 lekin agar is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin he, kya asli jawaab he? The second problem is that Char is created by Arya Satya
 ve buddha kii shikshaaon mul ke hisse ke rup main he? is formule ko buddha dharm kii jad main katautee
 Life is sorrow, death is sorrow, and rebirth is sorrow, so there is an end to everything
 na to dharm he or na hi darshan ek aadmi duniya main khushi praapt karne main madad kar sakate hai
 If no one can escape from sorrow, then, what can Buddha Dharma do, what can a man with such grief do to give relief there ever since birth? The four Arya truths are a great big hurdle in the path of non-buddhists accepting the Gospel of Buddhism
 chaar arya satya ke liye aadmi ke liye aashaa inkaar karte hai
 The four Aryan truths make the gospel of the Buddha the gospel of despotism
 ve mul susamachar ke farm kaa hissaa he, yaa ve bhikshuon dwaara ek baad kii abhivruddhi kar rahe hai? The third problem is related to the principles of the soul, karma and rebirth
 buddha aatma ke astitv se inkaar kiya
 But he is also said to have confirmed the doctrine of karma and rebirth
 ek baar main ek sawaal uthta he
 If there is a soul, how can there be karma? If there is a soul, how can there be rebirth? These are shocking questions
 kis arth main buddha shabd karm or punarjanm kaa upyog kiya tha? vah unhen samaj main aata he jisamen ve apane din ke brahmanon dwaara istemaal kiya gaya tulana main ek alag arth main prayog karte hai? yadi haa, to kya arth main? vah unhen ek hi bhaavana he jisamen brahman unhen istemaal main prayog karte hai? yadi haa, to aatma ke inkaar or karm or punarjanm kii abhipushti ke bich ek bhayanak virodhabhas nahin he? is virodhabhas kaa samaadhaan kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The fourth problem is related to bhikkhu
 bhikkhu banane main buddha kii vastu kya thi? vastu ek sahi aadmi banane ke liye kiya gaya tha? yaa logon kii seva or unke dost, guide kiya ja rahaa he or darshanik ke liye apana jivan devoting ek saamaajik sevak banane ke liye apane uddeshy tha? yah ek bahut hi asli sawaal he
 The future of Buddhism depends on this
 bhikkhu keval ek sahi aadmi he, to vah buddha dharm ke prachaar-prasar ke liye kisi kaam kaa nahin he, kyonki haalanki ek sahi aadmi vah ek swaarthee aadmi he
 If, on the other hand, he is a social servant, he can be the hope of proven Buddhism
 is prashn kaa saidhantik sthirataa ke hit main he, lekin buddha dharm ke bhavishya ke hit main itnaa nahin karne kaa faisla kiya janaa chahie

 'mansabdar' in Persian means mansabdar
 mughal samrajya main mansab se taatpary us padasthiti se tha jo badshaah apane padaadhikariyon ko pradaan karata tha
 There were two types of mansab, 'jat' and 'rider'
 mansab kii pratha kaa aarambh sarvapratham akbar ne san 1575 main kiya
 'jat' refers to the position of mansabdar that he held in the administrative post
 uskaa vetan bhi usee anupaat main un vetan soochiyon ke aadhaar par jo ki us samay lagu thim nirdhaarit hota tha
 The cavalry class meant how much of a troop crew to retain a mansabdar; And how much salary will he get for this
 iskaa nirdhaaran prachlit vetankram ko savaaron kii sankhya se guna karke hota tha
 It is said that the origins of the Mansab system can be traced back to the 'decimal' organization of the early Turkish and Mongol forces, and with this as the basis, Akbar not only converted the present military category into the 'jat' category and a new 'rider' category Giving birth fulfilled the purpose which was the ancient category
 lekin is baat kaa koi pramaan nahin he ki 1575 se purv bhi mansab die jate the
 From this it appears that the categories of 'jat' and 'rider' were started simultaneously in the same year
 akbar ke samay main savaar shrenee praaia: yaa to jaat shrenee ke baraabar athwa kam hi hoti thi
 Jahangir made an important experiment in the mansabdari system i
e
 the introduction of two-horse and three-horse range
 do ashv va teen ashv shrenee ko savaar shrenee kaa hi bhaag mana jaataa tha
 The salary and military responsibilities of the two-horsemen receiving the three-horse category were doubled
 'jaat' shrenee par vetan prayek shrenee ke liye alag-alag nirdhaarit tha
 The increase in salary was not proportional to the increase in category
 paanch hajaar se neeche kii jaat shrenee par vetan teen virgo main alag alag nirdhaarit tha- pratham, jab savaar shrenee jaat shrenee ke baraabar ho; dwitiya, jab 'savaar' shrenee 'jaat' shrenee se kam to ho parantu aadhe se kam na ho; tritiy jab aadhe se bhi kam ho
 The salary of the first class was more than the second class, and the salary of the second class was more than the third class
 savaar shrenee par vetan shreniyon ke anusaar alag alag nishchit nahin tha; lekin prati ikai par vetan kii dar sthaayee rup se bataai gai he
 From Shahjahan to the latter, the rate of salary per unit of 'rider' category was eight thousand
 savaar shrenee kaa vetan is yoga ko savaar sankhya se guna karke nikaala ja saktaa he
 The salary was given to the mansabdar in either cash or jagir
 shahjahan ke rajyakaal main 'masik anupaat' vyavastha kaa janm hua
 This system was also applied to cash payrolls
 iske parinamswaroop mansabadaaron ke vetan, suvidhaon tathaa kartavyon main kami aa gai
 There were many deductions in 'fixed pay'
 sabase adhik katautee dakkhini mansabadaaron ke vetanon main kii jaati thi or yah daamon main ek chauthai kii kami hoti thi
 In particular, the following deductions were applied to all the mansabdars if not forgiven - fodder for cattle, demand for logistics and two prices in rupees
 mansab ke saath-saath akbar ne 1575 main daagne kii pratha kaa prarambh kiya
 Its purpose was to force each mansabdar to retain as many horses and cavalry as they were required for state service
 falswaroop sainik jimmedaariyon se bachaav ko rokane ke liye akbar ne ghodon ko daagne tathaa vyaktiyon ke liye 'cheharaa' kii pratha ko apanaaya
 Abulfazl's description suggests that in Akbar's time the mansabdar was expected to produce as many soldiers as he could in the 'rider' category
 aisa na karne par use dandit kiya jaataa tha
 It remains to be considered whether the number expected from the mansabdar according to his 'rider' category was that of horses or soldiers? In Shah Jahan's time, under the 'tritiyansh' rule, the 100 rider class mansabdar had to carry 33 riders and 66 horses
 isse yahi prathit hota he ki akbar ke samay main 100 'savaar' shrenee ke liye 50 savaar or 100 ghodon se adhik nahin maange jate honge
 Shah Jahan re-organized the mansabdari system
 jo mansabadar un pradeshon main hi niyukt the jahaan unako jaagiren praapt thim, unase yah ummid kii jaati thi ki ve apni 'savaar' shrenee ke ek tihaai savaar prastut karenge; aise pradeshon main niyukt hone par jahaan unki jaagiren nahin thim keval ek chauthai; or balkh yaa badakashaan main niyukt hone par panchamaansh
 The fifth part rule also applied to the mansabdars who received salary cash
 panchamaansh niyam ke antargat vaarshik vyavastha main 5000 'savaar' shrenee par 1000 savaar tathaa 2200 ghode rahenge
 In Siddhantarupa all the mansabdars were appointed by the emperor
 praaia: mughalon kii sainik bhartee jati athwa vansh ke aadhaar par hi kii jaati thi, yogyata ke liye koi vishesh sthaan nahin tha

 Jalaluddin Firoz Khilji ascended the throne only after the assassination of the last Sultan of the Mamluk or Ghulam dynasty, Shamsuddin Qumars, hence the establishment of the Khilji dynasty in history is also known as the Khilji revolution

 Cuban Revolutionary and politician Fidel Castro participated in the Cuban Revolution from 1953 to 1959
 apane praarambhik jivan se fidel kastro ne phulgensio batista kii sainik sarkaar kaa ek arth-sainik sanghathan "aandolan" ke zarie takhta patane kaa faisalaa kiya
 In July 1953, he attempted an unsuccessful attack on the Moncada barracks, during which many guerrillas were killed and Castro arrested

 Renaming Fidel Castro's gang as a July 26 movement, the Batista government pardoned him in May 1955 because the government did not face any political challenge from Fidel

 Here these people met Che Guevara, the Marxist leader of Argentina, and together they formed a small revolutionary party aimed at overthrowing Batista

 Due to an attack from Batista's army, these men fled to the Sierra Maestra hills where 19 safe men set up camps from where the army's war efforts began

 The group collaborated with other Cuban revolutionary parties and Castro became an "international figure" when he featured in The New York Times

 However, the conventional war strategy by his army did not compete with Castro's raiding policies, and eventually MR 26-7 advanced from the Sierra Maestra to capture the majority of the Orient and Las Viès
 is baat ko bhaanpate hue ki yuddh uske haath se nikal rahi thi, batista dominican ganraajya chalaa gaya jabaki faujee netaa eulogio kaantiyo ne desh kii baag-door sanbhali
 When revolutionary forces seized most of Cuba, Castro issued orders for the arrest of Kantio, while a short-lived government was formed by making Manuel Urrutia Lyão the president and José Miró Kardona as prime minister to create laws that weakened the Batista group
 Go march 1952 main cubai faujee general fulgensio batista ne satta ko apane qabze main le liya, jiske kaaran chunaavon se bane raashtrapati karlos prio sokarras ko mexico bhaagna padaa
 While declaring himself president, Batista decided to plan presidential elections and called his new system a "discipline-bound democracy"
 auron kii tarah kastro bhi ise ek vyakti kii taanaashaahee maanate the
 Batista went to the right and deepened relations with the capitalists and the US, while breaking diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and suppressed the labor unions and filed cases against Cuban socialist groups

 When Castro's case began to show impunity, he began to look at other options to oust the new government
 partido ortodoxo ke ahimsawadi vipaksh se asantusht hokar kastro ne "aandolan" kii sthapana kii, ek aisa dal jisaki naagarik or sainik cametiyaan thi
 The first one protested through an underground newspaper "el Akusador" while the second Batista recruited and empowered and trained the opponents
 jab kastro aandolan ke mukhya bane, sanghathan gairqanoonee ikai pranali par aadhaarit tha, jisamen har ikai ke das sadsy the
 The main focus of the movement was a dozen members who were dissatisfied with the Ortodoxo, however from July 1952 these people started recruiting on a large scale, which included 1,200 members within a year, a hundred units were formed, most of which were the poor of Havana Were from districts kastro ke krantikari samaajwaad se gahare sambandh hone ke baavjood usne communist pi es pi se judane se khud ko dur rakhaa kyonki isse dar tha ki rajnatik narampanthi dar jaayenge, haalaanki vyaktigat rup se usne kai pi es pi sadasyon se sampark banaae rakhaa, jisamen uske bhai raul kastro bhi rahe
 In later times Castro stated that the members of the movement were merely anti-batista and that hardly any of them held strong socialist or anti-imperialist views, which, according to Castro, were "a profound influence of New York ideology and the advertising system"
 For this reason, the class consciousness of the Cuban working class was being suppressed
 "ab se kuch hi lamhon main yaa to aap vijayi hon yaa parajeet, magar jo bhi ho - kaan kholkar doston is baat ko maan len ki is aandolan ko jeetna hoga

 Castro's raids had intended that he would arrive at the hideout on July 25, wearing a military uniform, which was the time of the St
 James festival when most officers were not present

 Castro's plan was an imitation of 19th-century Cuban freedom fighters who raided Spain's barracks; Castro began to see himself as the leader of independence and successor to the national hero José Marati
 kastro ne 165 krantikariyon ko is mishan ke liye jamaa kiya; 138 santiyago main or anya 27 bayamo main
 Regarding several young men from Havana and Pinar del Río, Castro decided that no one should have children except himself, and he refused to let the army shed blood in any situation other than the encounter

 Alaram rang as soon as the barracks arrived, with most of the gardens outside the hideout being wiped out

 After this, Castro ordered to turn back

 Aesthetics is the study of sensory-emotional qualities — religion and values
 kala, samskruti or prakruti kaa pratankan hi saundaryashastra he
 Aesthetics is a part of philosophy

 Beauty is the scripture in which there is an elemental, philosophical and poignant interpretation of the beauty that is expressed or contained in artistic works, creations etc

 yah nazariyaa keval kriti kii sundarata or kala-rup se hi apana sarokaar rakhte hue uske raajnneetik or sandarbhagat ayaamon ko vimarsh ke daayre se baahar rakhata he
 But there are also some methods of brainstorming art and literature that communicate the meaning of works and social and historical aspects of their creation process
 marxvaadi saundaryashastra ek aisa hi vimarsh he
 Plato's work in ancient Greek philosophy discusses the concept of beauty in Hippias Major
 naatak kii dukhaant style par arestu dwaara apni rachana poitics main kiye gayi vichaar ne kala-aalochana ko lambe arase tak prabhavit kiya he
 In the context of non-western ancient thinking on art and beauty, the Natyashastra of India, Abhinavagupta's rasa-siddhanta and the creation of Chinese scholar Cheng Yin-yuwan, Li-tai ming-hua Chi's unique and elaborate discussions presented in the Western world as well is believed
 kala-anushilan kii is parampara kii vyakhya karne ke gair-pashchimi maanak abhi tak nahin ban paye hai or pashchimi maanakon ke zariye kii gayi vyakhyaaon ke nattejey asantoshjanak nikle hai
 a separate concept of aesthetics emerged as a philosophical activity in Western thought in the eighteenth century when art works began to be isolated from handcrafts
 iskaa nateeja siddhantkaron dwaara lalit kala kii avadharana ke sutrikaran main niklaa
 Alexander Gottlieb Bomgarthen wrote an esthetica in 1750 to initiate a debate
 iske saat saal baad david hum dwaara ‘of da standard of test’ likh kar saundaryashastra ke ubharate hue vimarsh ko prashnaankit kiya gaya
 But the real beginning of modern European aesthetic aesthetics began with Emmanuel Kant's work published in 1790, Critique of Judgment
 apni is kriti main kaant ne saundaryashastreey akalan kii kasautiyon ko saarvbhaum banane par jor diya
 But on the other hand, he appeared to be skeptical of the possibility of any kind of universal aesthetics
 is virodhabhas ke baavjood kaant kii uplabdhi yah rahi ki unhone kala or saundarya kii vivechna ke liye kuch anivaary dvibhajanon ko sthapit kar diya
 The most notable of these dialects are: sense perception and logic, essence and form, expression and expression, pleasure and epiphany, freedom and necessity, etc
 kaant kii duusari uplabdhi yah thi ki unhone saundaryashastreey anubhav or andrik anubhav ke bich antar sthapit kiya
 He said that aesthetics should be interpreted and concluded without any practical attachment to the goal of analysis
 unnisvin sadi ke bare main kaha ja saktaa he ki vah saundaryashastra kii shatabdi thi
 It was only on Kant's land that German scholars later created a larger philosophical framework of aesthetics
 higel ne apni rachana lectures on esthetics main, shoppenhor ne da world ez vil and ripragentation main or nitshe ne berth of tragedy main pashchimi saundaryashastra ke vibhinn pahaluon kii baarik vyakhyaayein kin or uske naye ayaamon ko prakashit kiya
 Formalism emerged in English-speaking aesthetics in the late nineteenth century
 victoriayan britain ne ‘kala kala ke liye’ kaa naaraa diya jiske pravaktaaon main auskar wild kaa naam ullekhneey he
 The stylistic approach emphasizing purely aesthetic experience deeply influenced modern art forms in almost all fields
 lekin is andolan ke virodh kii dhvaniyaan mahaan roosi sahityakar liyo tolstoy kii rachana whot iz art? or america parinamwad ke pramukh pravaktaa jon divi kii kriti art ez experience main sunaayi deen
 Tolstoy argued that art that cannot communicate moral sensations among humans, however great it may be in terms of metaphorical criteria, cannot be appreciated
 divi ne bhi sampreshan kii bhoomika ke sawaal par rupvaad se loha lete hue kala ko saundaryashastra ke naam par uske daayre ke baahar maujuud anubhav kii sanrachanaon se kaat kar rakhane kaa virodh kiya
 The German tradition of aesthetic thinking continued into the twentieth century as well
 ghatnakriyashastra, vyakhyashastra or marxvad ke auzaaron kaa istemaal karke saundaryashastra sambandhi siddhanton ko or samrudh kiya gaya
 In 1936 Martin Heidegger wrote an essay like 'the Origin of the Work of Art' which is considered one of the best works of philosophy of art
 haidagar ne is niabandh main daawa kiya ki kala-kriti ko is jagat main sthit vastu ke rup main dekhnaa aadhuniktaa kii moolbhoot lakshanik trutiyon main se ek he
 According to Heidegger, art opens the doors of a new world, truth not only decreases in the form of art, it also inaugurates the existence of things in the realm of our own experience
 is tarah saundaryashastra ke madhyam se haidagar ne aadhuniktaa kii aalochana karte hue vastuon kii parmparik astitv-mimasaa or praudyogikeey vyakhya ko aade haathon liya
 By the mid-twentieth century, the utility of aesthetics began to be questioned
 sadi kii shuruyaat main diye gayi apane kuch vyakhyanon main edward bulo yah prashn puch chuke the ki kahin kala or saundarya kii paribhaashaayen kalakaar kii srijan- kshamta kaa kshay to nahin kar rahi hai
 These lectures were published in 1957 and in the sixties American artist Barnett Newman declared that the use of aesthetics is the same for art as that of ornithology for birds
 arthath saundaryashastra se anbhigya kalakaar hi acha he
 Under the study of culture, the oriented trends of aesthetics have been rigorously tested
 pier bordiyo ne samskruti ke samajashaastra ke tahat kala ke vichaardhaaratmak aadhaar kii na keval shinaakht kii balki yah bhi kaha ki isi kaaran se saundayshaastra apni hi saanskrithik or raajnneetik jadon kaa sandhan nahin kar paaya he
 Bordeaux's counterpoint to this idea is found in Adorno's work Aesthetic Theory
 adorno beesvin sadi kii avangaard kala kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki kala main abhi bhi vichaardhaara kaa pratwaad karne kii kshamta he
 According to Adorno, art is a product of its society, but its creation process also contains an autonomous moment from social determinism
 isliye vah kalakaar or uske darshak yaa pathak ko tatkaaleen prabhutvshaalee samskruti dwaara thamaye gayi taur- tareekon se itar sochane kaa mauka bhi detii he
 Some Marxist scholars have also tried to develop a Marxist category of aesthetics
 hindi ke pramukh marxvaadi saahityalochak namvar singh ne is tarah kii koshishon ko aalochanatmak drushti se dekhte hue iskaa pehla udhaaharan soviet sangh main ‘samaajawaadee yatharthwaad’ kaa shaastra-nirmaan mana he
 He has said, 'with the formation of scripture, social reality was also formulated and the style of expressing that reality too
 dekhte-dekhte ek nayaa ritivaad chal padaa, rachana main bhi, aalochana main bhi
 The country which had a socialist revolution, did not hesitate to make any revolution in the field of literature and art
 yatharth kaa aisa or itnaa apmaan to kranti ke pehle ke sahitya main bhi nahin hua tha or unnisvin sadi ke europe ke sahitya main bhi nahin jab burjwa kranti ne yatharthwaad ko janm diya tha
 The condition became very much like that of the literature-trend called Hindi rituals, when poems were being written keeping the characteristic texts of the rhetoric
 ’ Namvar Singh gives another example of a large treatise called Aesthetics by George Lukach
 ve ise lukach dwaara apane lagbhag saath varshon ke deergh sahitya-chintan ko antat ek vyavasthit shaastra main baandhane kaa viraat prayaas qaraar dete hai, ‘hazaron prishthon kaa yah vishaal granth abhi tak german bhashaa main hi uplabdh he or jo german acchhee tarah jaanate honge, vahi iske bare main kuch vishwaspurvak kah sakane main sakasham honge
 On the basis of what has been said about him so far in English and the impression he has received from his sporadic excerpts, it can be said that it has failed to try all the arts in 'imitation'
 is prakaar marxvaadi lukach jab sabhi kalaon ko ek shaastra main baandhane chalate hai to antat arestu kii sharan jane ko baadhya hote hai
 An English weekly reviewing this treatise had published a cartoon in which Aristotle's appearance and appearance with Lukach Marx's beard
 ’ namvar singh kii manyata he ki lukach ke drushtaant se marxvaadi saundaryashastra kii is lambi parampara kaa ek kamazor pahalu saamne aata he
 He says that 'often he himself failed to challenge an institution called' Kala 'and saw no harm in accepting the classical definition of art
 buniyadi rup main ek baar in paribhaashaon ko sweekaar kar lene ke baad to phir thode- bahut her-pher ke saath is-us kavi yaa kriti ke moolyankan kaa kaary hi shesh rahata he; or kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki marxvaadi saundaryashastriyon ne is kshetra main apni pratibha kaa johar bakhubi dikhaaya he— unchi samskruti ke bade-se- bade vichaarkon se hode lete hue
 The language of interpretation and evaluation is certainly materialistic as well as historical, but overall it is not very different from the dominant tradition

 The story of Lord Satyanarayan is popular in the world
 hindu dharmavalambio ke bich sabase pratishthit vrath katha ke rup main bhagwaan vishnu ke satya swaroop kii satyanarayan vrath katha he
 Some people organize this story regularly, on the fulfillment of their wishes
 satyanarayan vratakthake do bhaag hai, vrath-puja evam katha
 The Satyanarayana Vratakatha is compiled from Rewakhand of Skandapuran
 satya ko narayan kii sthiti main aae
 The wood-seller Bhil was also very poor
 kisi tarah lakdi bechakar apana or apane parivaar kaa pet paalataa tha
 He too satya with full devotion; Satyanarayana worshiped God
 raja ulkamukhbhi nishthavan satyavrathithe
 He regularly worshiped Lord Satyanarayana on the banks of Bhadrashilanadi
 satyacharanhi unke jivan kaa mulmantra tha
 On the other side were the satyavrathees of the monk and monk Tungadhvaja Swarthabandhi Koti
 swaarth saadhan hetu baadhya hokar in donon paatro ne satyacharankia ; satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchki
 Sadhu Vanik had no faith in the Satyanarayana God
 satyanarayan puujarchka sankalp lene ke uparant uske parivaar main kalavatinamak kanya-ratna kaa janm hua
 After the birth of the girl, she forgot her resolve and did not worship the Lord Satyanarayan
 usne puja kanya ke vivaah tak ke liye taal di
 Even on the occasion of the marriage of the girl, she took the face of Satyacharan and Pujarcha, and went on a business trip with son-in-law
 daivayog se ratnasarpuramein shvasur-damaad ke upar chori kaa aarope laga
 Here he had to stay in the prison of King Chandraketu
 shvasur or damaad karagaar se mukt hue to shvasur ne ek dandiswamise jhooth bol diya ki uski nauka main ratnadinhin, maatr lata-patr he
 Due to this falsehood, he had to suffer the destruction of property
 antat:baadhya hokar usne satyanarayan bhagwaan kaa vrath kiya
 Due to the misconduct of the monk, his house was also horribly stolen
 patni-putr dane-dane ko muhtaaj
 In the meantime, he was informed of the return of the monk to the house
 us samay kalavatiapani mata leelavati ke saath satyanarayan bhagwaan kii puujarchkar rahi thi
 On hearing the news, Kalawati ran to meet her father and husband
 isi hadbadi main vah bhagwaan kaa prasad grahan karnaa bhul gai
 Due to non-acceptance of the prasad, the monk and his son-in-law drowned in the sea with the boat
 phir achaanak kalavatiko apni bhul kii yaad ai
 She came home to the race and took her prasad
 iske baad sab kuch thik ho gaya
 King Tungadhwajki was also almost in this situation

 Rajasattamandandhatungdhwajan did not go to the place of worship nor received the offerings of God given by Gopabandhu
 isiilie unhen ksht bhogana pada
 Finally, he was obliged to worship Lord Satyanarayana and take a fast of Satyacharan
 satyanarayan vratakthake uparyukt paanchon paatr maatr kathapatrahi nahin, ve maanavmanaki do pravritiyon ke pratik hai
 These trends are satyagraha and mithyagraha
 lok main sarvadine donon pravritiyon ke dharak rahete hai
 Through these characters, Skanda Purana wants to give the message that even the poor and the powerless person can be satyagrahi, satyavrati, truthful and wealth and power person can be misleading
 shatanandaur kashtha-vikreta bhil nirdhan or sattahinathe
 Nevertheless, there was intense satyagraha
 iske vipareet sadhu vanikevam raja tungadhvajadhansampann evam sattasampannthe
 But his instinct is misplaced
 satta evam dhansampann vyakti main satyagrah ho, aisi ghatana viral hoti he
 King Ulkamukh, the character of the story of Satyanarayana, was a person of the same kind
 puri satyanarayan vratakthaka nihitarth yah he ki loukik evam paralaukikahiton kii sadhana ke liye manushya ko satyacharanka vrath lenaa chahie
 Truth is God
 satya hi vishnu he
 The root cause of all evils, all tribulations, all conflicts in the world is the lack of satyacharan

 However, the term is sometimes used to refer to the elimination of all forms of enmity between all individuals for world peace
 jabaki vishwa shanti saidhantik rup se sambhav he, kuch kaa maananaa he ki maanav prakruti swaabhaavik taur par ise rokatii he
 This belief stems from the idea that humans are inherently violent or that in certain circumstances rational factors will prompt them to act violently
 tathaapi dusron kaa maananaa he ki yuddh maanav prakruti kaa ek sahaj hissaa nahin hai or yah myth vastav main logon ko vishwa shanti ke liye prerit hone se roktaa he
 Several theories have been proposed for how world peace can be achieved
 inamen se kai neeche soochibaddh hai
 World peace can be achieved when there is no conflict over resources
 udhaaharan ke liye, tel ek aisa hi sansaadhan haior tel kii aapurti ko lekar sangharsh janaa pahachaanaa he
 Therefore, developing technology that uses a reusable fuel source can be a way to achieve world peace
 daawa kiya jaataa he ki kabhi-kabhi vishwa shanti kisi khaas raajnneetik vichaardhaara kaa ek aprihaary parinaam hoti he
 According to former US President George W
 Bush, "the pursuit of democracy will lead to world peace
" Leon Trotsky, a Marxist thinker, believes that the World Revolution will lead to communist world peace
 vivaadaaspad democratic shanti siddhant ke samarthakon kaa daawa he ki is baat ke majboot anubhavjanya sakshya maujuud hai ki loktantric desh kabhi nahin yaa mushkil se hi ek-duusare ke khilaaf yuddh chhedate hai
 
 Jack Levy repeatedly asserts that "no matter what we do, we need a behavioral law in international relations"
 audyogic kranti ke baad se loktantric banane vaale deshon main vruddhi ho rahi he
 a world peace is thus possible if this trend continues and if the democratic peace principle is correct
 haalanki is siddhant ke kai sambhav apwaad he
 In his book "capitalism Peace Theory" Ion Rand considers that the great wars of history were fought against free by countries with relatively more controlled economies of the time and that capitalism provided mankind with the longest peace in history and the Wars did not take place during the period from the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 to the end of the First World War in 1914 in the participation of the entire civilized world
 yah yaad rakhaa janaa chahie ki unnisvin sadi kii raajnneetik pranaliyaan shuddh poonjivadi nahin thim, balki mishrit arthvyavasthaaon vaali thim
 Although the element of capitalism was dominated, it was as close to a century of capitalism as it was until the arrival of mankind
 lekin puri unnisvin sadi ke dauraan rajyavad ke tatv falte-phoolate rahe or 1914 main puri duniya main iske visphot ke samay tak shaamil sarkaron par rajyavad kii nitiyon kaa bolbalaa rahaa
 However, this theory ignored the brutal colonial wars waged by Western countries against countries outside Europe, as well as the wars in Germany and Italy for unification, the franco-persian War, and other conflicts in Europe
 yah yuddh ke abhaav ko shanti ke paimaane ke rup main pesh karata he, jab vaastavik rup main varg sangharsh maujuud rahaa
 Some proponents of Cobdenism claim that removing tariffs and introducing international free trade will make wars impossible, because free trade prevents a nation from becoming self-sufficient, a necessity for protracted wars
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek desh aagneyastron kaa utpaadan or doosraa gola-barood kaa utpaadan karata he, to donon ek-duusare se hi ladenge, kyonki pehla gola-barood hasil karne main asamarth hoga or doosraa hathiyaar hasil karne main
 Critics argue that free trade cannot prevent a country from making emergency plans to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that one country can simply meet its needs with another
 iskaa ek is acha udhaaharan pehla vishwa yuddh he
 Both Britain and Germany managed to become partially self-sufficient during the war
 yah vishesh rup se is tathy kii vajah se ahm tha ki germany ke paas ek yuddh arthvyavastha banane kii koi yojana nahin thi
 More generally, its other proponents argue that free trade, even if not making war impossible, could lead to war, and trade restrictions due to the wars of international companies engaged in production, research and sales in many different countries Can prove to be expensive
 is tarah, ek shaktishaalee lobby- jo keval rashtriya companiyon ke kaaran upasthit nahin hoti to vah yuddh ke khilaaf tark de sakati he
 Called bilateral assured destruction) is a principle of military strategy, in which the use of full-scale nuclear weapons by two rival parties effectively results in the destruction of both the attacker and defender
 sheet yuddh ke dauraan dwipaksheeya aashwast vinaash kii niti ke samarthakonki vajah se yuddh kii ghaatkata is kadar badi ki kisi bhi paksh ke liye kisi shuddh laabh kii sambhaavna nahin bani or is tarah yuddh vyarth sabit hue
 Some people see a trend in national politics, under which city-states and nation-states became integrated and suggested that the international forum would follow it
 china, italy, sanyukt rajya america, germany, bharat or britain jaise kai desh ekikrut ho gayi, jabaki europea union ne baad main iskaa anupaalan kiya or isse sanket miltaa he ki or adhik bhumandalikaran ek ekikrut vishwa vyavastha banane main madad karegaa
 Proponents of separatism and non-interventionism claim that a world made up of many nations can co-exist peacefully as long as it remains firmly focused on domestic affairs and imposes its will on other countries Do not try gaiyr-hastkshepwaad ke sambandh main pruthakatawaad ko lekar bhramit nahin hona chahie
 Separatism, like non-interventionism, suggests avoiding interference in the internal affairs of other nations, but insists on protectionism and a ban on international trade and tourism
 duusari taraf gaiyr-hastkshepwaad mukt vyapaar ke raajnneetik va sainya a-hastkshep ke sangyojan kii vakaalat karata he
 Nations such as Japan are perhaps best known for establishing separatist policies in the past
 japani ido, tokugava ne ek pruthakatavaadi avadhi ido avadhi shuru kii, jiske tahat japan ne puri duniya se apane ko alag kar diya
 It was a famous isolation period and was well documented in many areas
 vishwa shanti ko sthaneey, swa-nirdhaarit vyavhaar ke ek parinaam ke rup main darshaya gaya he, jo shakti ke sansthanikaran ko roktaa he or hinsa ko badhaava detaa he
 The solution is not so much based on an agreed agenda or investment in high authority, whether divine or political, as a self-organized network of mutually agreed mechanisms that results in a viable political-economic social fabric 
 abhisaran ke utpreran ke liye pramukh takanic vichaaron kaa prayog he, jise baikacasting kehete he or isse koi bhagidaari main sakasham ho saktaa he, bhale hi vah kisi saanskrithik prishthbhumi, dharmik siddhant, raajnneetik sambhddhata yaa janasankhyikeey umr kaa ho
 Similar collaborative mechanisms are emerging around the open source projects, including Wikipedia, via the Internet, and social media is developing
