 There are following 7 subcategories in this category, total subcategories 7 is shrenee main nimnlikhit 33 prishth hai, kul prishth 33 Elite class or elite is called a small group in sociology and politics in a society or community that has more wealth, political power or social influence than its number
 samaaj ke anya virgon kii tulana main sambhraant varg apane kshetra main adhik shaktishaalee hota he
 In any area of social life, a small and relatively homogenous group on top of the controlling structures is termed elation
 iske samanarthak latin shabd ‘ilit’ kaa matlab he chunaa hua yaa sarvshereshth
 To become an elite it is essential to have the power, convenience, competence and organization and leadership capacity
 kisi bhi vyavastha yaa pranali ko jari rakhane ke liye zaruri samajha jaataa he ki uske sanchaalan kii bagdor kuch suyogy vyaktiyon ke samooh ke haath main rahe or samay-samay par unki jagah lene ke liye waisi hi kshamtaaon se las logon kaa chayan kiya jaataa rahe
 This request guarantees continuity of eligibility at the top or leadership
 abhijan ke vyakhyaakaar parato kaa kahana he ki ilit main khaas tarah ke manovaigyanik gun hote hai jinke aadhaar par kutilata, chal, takat or faisalakun pahal kadami kaa istemaal karte hue vah satta par kaabiz rahata he
 Since the group of elites is small, it is easier to act more coherently and coherently
 uske sadsy aapas main lagaataar sampark banaaye rakhte hai jisase aapasi mataiky ke aadhaar par niti-nirmaan kii prakriya main baadha nahin padati
 It is not the case that the elite always manage to save their power
 unki vifaltaa kaa dosha aam taur par raajnneetik kaushal yaa ichha-shakti ke abhaav par madha jaataa he
 The elites, who keep on keeping alive with the society and receive new ideas and do their restorations, have been living for a long time
 jo abhijan aisa nahin karte, unka vakt jaldi puraa ho jaataa he or unke kilaaf khadaa hua prati-abhijan kisi ‘maas’ yaa jansamooh kaa netritv karata hua unke haath se satta chin letaa he
 Initially the elitist theory was an anti-democracy concept that was formulated to justify the authority of the rulers to challenge the legitimacy of the evolving democratic governance system of Europe
 aage chal kar beesvin sadi ke madhya main is siddhant kii antardrushtiyon se loktantric siddhant ko pusht karne kii cheshtaa kii gayi
 The motive behind this was to save the liberal democracy from the mass movements under communist or fascist leadership
 loktantr main aavashyak nahin ki saare abhijan satta main hi hon
 In today's democratic systems, many groups of elites can be seen competing among themselves to hold the reins of power
 pehle se jame hue abhijan-samooh kii sadsyta grahan karne ke liye loktantr ke manch par naye abhijanon kaa aagaman hota rahata he
 Initially, the elite were selected only from the upper class, but now the leadership powers of the lower and deprived sections are also included in the category of the elite
 vah loktantr adhik safal or tikaoo samajha jaataa he jiske abhijanon kaa aakaar badhata rahata he
 On the contrary, in the democracies where the elites make barricades against increasing their size, the system continues to be threatened again and again
 abhijan siddhanth multah is pracheen vishwaas par aadhaarit he ki samaaj mutthi bhar shaskaon or bahusankhyak shasiton main banta hota he
 Plato suggested the identification of people with the requisite nature-mandated abilities to govern
 itihaas or raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa yah ek prachlit tarika he ki un abhijanon kaa adhyayan kiya jaae jinke paas samaaj ke vibhinn kshetron ke sanchaalan ke liye nirnay lene ke adhikaar rahe hai
 In the early twentieth century Italian sociologists Gaetano Mosca and Wilfredo Pareto, as well as German followers of Mosca, Robert Michaels, reacted against the development of democratic systems, claiming that the rule of the elite is a key feature of human history
 yah sutrikaran unnisvin sadi main marxvad dwaara pravartit or pusht samtamulak ke ke kilaaf tha
 These theorists agreed with Marx that the leadership of societies had been in the hands of minorities in the past, but they also said that these minority groups were not necessarily the owners of the means of production
 unke prabhutv kaa strot aarthik nahin tha, balki unki satta vividh sroton se aati thi
 It is another matter that the elite used to accumulate wealth on a large scale by taking advantage of their dominance
 moska or parato kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki bhavishya ke samaajon ke netritv kaa pattern bhi aisa hi rahane vaala he
 Although these scholars insist that their sociology is not tied to any value, their sympathy for the emerging fascism in Italy was not hidden from anyone
 parato or michels to sidhe-sidhe fasiwad ke samarthak the or udaarpanthi moska vampanth se apni naaraazgi ke kaaran fasiwad ko ek majaburi kii tarah dekhte the
 Overall, the effort of these three theorists was that the parliamentary system should be limited only to the participation of the upper and middle class
 ve mazaduron or kisaanon ke pratinidhitiv vaali sansad ko tiraskaarpurn drushti se dekhte the
 Marxist theorists and advocates of democratic pluralism challenged this elitism
 marxvaadiyon ne kaha ki yah siddhant abhijanon ke prabhutv ke buniyadi aadhaar kii shinaakht karne main naakaam rahaa he
 Whether elites are military, religious, political or cultural; The foundation of their dominance must be seen in economic class relations
 bahultavaadiyon kaa tark tha ki aadhunik, viksit or udaarpanthi samaajon main satta or prabhutv ke liye vividh hiton ke bich pratiyogita hoti he
 Therefore, a group of handful members is never able to establish all-round dominance
 nirnay kii prakriya kaa centre sirf ek hi nahin hota
 In contrast to this reality, advocates of elitism adopt a flawed method of studying power and its sources in societies that stand on the basis of liberalism
 haalaanki abhijan siddhant loktantr virdohi tha, par beesvin sadi ke madhya main joseph shumpiter ne loktantric siddhant abhijan main abhijan siddhanth kaa samavesh kiya
 He said that even in democracy, governance should remain in the hands of the elite so that the system gets effective and stable orders
 bas shart yah he ki aise abhijanon kaa chayan loktantric prakriyaaon ke madhyam se kiya gaya ho
 Schumpeter's purpose behind doing this ideological engineering was to protect liberal democracy from movements led by anti-fascist elites who support fascism or communism
 bahultavaadi siddhant ko aade haathon lete hue shumpiter ne kaha ki satta or nirnay kii bahukendriyata kaa udaarataavaadi daawa sahi nahin he
 In fact, the control of the groups competing for dominance remains in the hands of a few leaders who do not necessarily follow the wishes and needs of their group members
 isliye samoohon ke bich kii pratiyogita unke netaaon ke bich kii pratiyogita ban jaati he
 As a result, pluralistic democracy turns into elite democracy
 is vichaar ke loktantr kaa tikaaupan or vikaas niskriy nagar samaaj par nirbhar na ho kar, uske abhijanon kii sakriyata or patibaddhta kaa hi parinaam hota he
 Whether it is a democratic system or autocracy, it is difficult to completely deny the importance of the elite
 kuch vidwaanon kaa tark he ki udaarataavaadi loktantr ke vyakhyaakaar zyaada dhyaan jansamoohon ke prabhaav main liye jane faisalon par dete hai
 In this way, the role of the initiatives taken by the elites is not fully understood
 ilit-study main dilchaspee rakhane vaale samaaj-vaigyanik saamaajik jivan ke vibhinn kshetron ke netaaon kii saamaajik or shaikshik prishthbhumi kii jaanch karke yah pataa lagane kii koshish karte hai ki kin karkon ke prabhaav main unhen abhijan-samooh main shaamil kiya gaya
 If more than one elite group is active in any part of society, it is ascertained what kind of social, political, economic and ideological interrelation is between them; And whether there is a possibility of integrating them
 ilit-study kaa ek doosraa aayam abhijanon or janata ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he
 It tries to know how the communication of this kind of relationship takes place from top to bottom and bottom to top
 is sambadh kii kaamiyaan-kuubiyaan tay karti hai ki ilit ko pratisthapit karne kii ichha rakhane vaali takaton kii sthiti kya he
 It is only from this analysis that the reasons behind the peaceful or revolutionary methods for removing a particular elite were working

 rhite mills ne ‘power ilit’ kii avadharana kaa sutrikaran kiya he
 According to Mills, three types of elites rule in the United States
 ye hai audyogic, raajnneetik faujee
 Interestingly, Mills, unlike other theorists, shows how the power elite created by this trio of elites is damaging to democracy
 abhijan siddhant ne samskruti-adhyayan ke kshetra main bhi hastkshep kiya he
 Critics of the rise of the mass society assume that contemporary mass media and the popular mass culture emanating from it are fatal to the superiority of the elite culture
 sambhraant varg kai prakaar ke ho sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye - Often a member of one type of elite is also a member of elite classes in other areas

 "city of Sisters" was written by Michael Schur, co-producer of the series directed by Alan Yang
 As a guest role in the episode featured comedian Fred Armisen, Raul, one of the deputy directors of the Department of Horticulture of Venezuela
 Armisen was a cast member of nbc's sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, where she has previously worked with actor Poehler and writer Schur
 Armisen has played the first character from Venezuela, and previously imitated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Saturday Night Live
 Armisen said that he got it by thinking of the character as his uncle, who is from Venezuela
 But he said it was not a difficult performance because of "the fun of most," the uniform which included a medallion with a tan military style jacket, a red cap and a Venezuelan flag with a sash color
 vardi bhi shaamil he ek kaalpanik dizin sil Schur, jo shaamil kii ek chhavi chawez, mashinagan, ek tel tower, ek sher or ek tota he
 Schur said that the plot of the episode, "they are very skeptical because the government in Venezuela is so powerful; military escorts and motorcades and stuff travel with their horticulture department
 They all have money in the world because of their oil and why they are the Pawnee The horticulture department is rinky-dink
 " a fan since his inception for Parks and Recreation, Armisen said that he laughed as soon as he was able to read the script, and also cast it with the reading table during the fun

 The city of "sister" is largely portrayed in a negative light in Chavez and his socialist ideology
 The script depicts Venezuelans as belittling and contemptuous Americans
 They are infrequently claimed in Venezuela in the power and splendor they are accustomed to in Venezuela

 She then meets the teams whose three Jaegers: striker Eureka, the first and only Mark-5 Jaeger, whose drivers are father-sons Hercules and Chuck Hansen, respectively; Then "cherno Alpha", the oldest Jaegers was still active for Jung, according to Pentecost, Mark-1 is an extremely brutal combat machine, driven by a couple named Sasha and Alexis Kadanowski, then the "crimson Typhoon"
 4 Jäger is governed by three arms, operated by three triangles of Taeung Wei - Cheyung, Hu and Jin and the fourth Jäger, for Ralif, is Gypsy Danger's Reconstruction and, in this renovation, it is equipped with additional weapons and a nuclear reactor core

 At the same time, Pentecost's adopted daughter, Maco Mori, who sees the possibility of a skilled pilot in Ralph's good partnership, pleads with Pentecost to see him drift once

 Pentecost then tells Newton to go to Hong Kong to find Kaiju's Gorakh buyer, Hannibal Chow, to capture Kaiju's brain and learn more about him
 drift ke dauraan, newton yah samaj jate he, ki kiju kaa yah mastishk bhi apni chetana se sakriy hokar kaam letaa he
 As a result, the two kaiju, codenamed Otaichi and Leatherback, enter the city together, creating havoc, as predicted by Gatlieb

 Newton and Hermann Gatlieb perform the drifting of the infant Kaiju's brain, and they discover that the breakup will only open with the presence of Kaiju's DNA, Pentecost now making a dangerous plan to close it
 lekin maamla tab bighad jaataa he, jab gatilib apni bhavishyavaanee main us viched dwaara sthir hone par teen or kiju ke paidaa hone kaa zikr karata he
 Before that, Jaegers' military body would have reduced the two machines, since they would not be able to take the risk due to their not being strong, Kaiju would have to be revoked anyway if mankind wanted to save itself from extinction

 But while wounded in the previous encounter of Hercules Hansen, Pentecost, Jager is also willing to be a co-pilot on striker Eureka with Chuck Hansen, even when diseased by radiation poisoning during the pilot's early war time; At the same time, Ralph and Maco provide Gypsy Danger to operate

 Ralif and Maco together beat and kill the wounded Slaterne, but their oxygen supply is destroyed

 Subsequently, shaking the corpse of Slaterne, he drives through the Gypsy Danger and undergoes a breakdown of that alien dimension

 Most fragrances are vocs

 Some vocs are hazardous to human health and harm the environment
 Anthropogenic vocs are regulated by law, especially indoors, where concentrations are the highest
 Harmful vocs typically are not acutely toxic, but have compounding long-term health effects
 Because the concentrations are usually low and the symptoms slow to develop, research into vocs and their effects is difficult
 Diverse definitions of the term VOC are in use
 The definitions of vocs used for control of precursors of photochemical smog used by the EPA, and states in the US with independent outdoor air pollution regulations include exemptions for vocs that are determined to be non-reactive, or of low-reactivity in the smog formation process
 EPA formerly defined these compounds as reactive organic gases but changed the terminology to VOC
 In the USA, different regulations vary between states - most prominent is the VOC regulation by SCAQMD and by the California Air Resources Board
 However, this specific use of the term vocs can be misleading, especially when applied to indoor air quality because many chemicals that are not regulated as outdoor air pollution can still be important for indoor air pollution
 Health Canada classes vocs as organic compounds that have boiling points roughly in the range of 50 se 250 °se
 
 The emphasis is placed on commonly encountered vocs that would have an effect on air quality
 a VOC is any organic compound having an initial boiling point less than or equal to 250 ° C
 measured at a standard atmospheric pressure of 101
3 kpa vocs are legally defined in the various laws and codes under which they are regulated
 Other definitions may be found from government agencies investigating or advising about vocs
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates vocs in the air, water, and land
 The Safe Drinking Water Act implementation includes a list labeled "vocs in connection with contaminants that are organic and volatile
" The EPA also publishes testing methods for chemical compounds, some of which refer to vocs
 In addition to drinking water, vocs are regulated in discharges to waters, as hazardous waste, but not in non industrial indoor air
 The United States Department of Labor and its Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulate VOC exposure in the workplace
 Volatile organic compounds that are hazardous material would be regulated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration while being transported
 Not counting methane, biological sources emit an estimated 1150 teragrams of carbon per year in the form of vocs
 The majority of vocs are produced by plants, the main compound being isoprene
 The remainder are produced by animals, microbes, and fungi, such as molds
 The strong odor emitted by many plants consists of green leaf volatiles, a subset of vocs
 Emissions are affected by a variety of factors, such as temperature, which determines rates of volatilization and growth, and sunlight, which determines rates of biosynthesis
 Emission occurs almost exclusively from the leaves, the stomata in particular
 a major class of vocs is terpenes, such as myrcene
 Providing a sense of scale, a forest 62,000 km2 in area is estimated to emit 3,400,000 kilograms of terpenes on a typical August day during the growing season
 vocs should be a factor in choosing which trees to plant in urban areas
 Induction of genes producing volatile organic compounds, and subsequent increase in volatile terpenes has been achieved in maize using -3-hexen-1-ol and other plant hormones
 Anthropogenic sources emit about 142 teragrams of carbon per year in the form of vocs
 a major source of man-made vocs are coatings, especially paints and protective coatings
 Solvents are required to spread a protective or decorative film
 Approximately 12 billion liters of paints are produced annually
 Typical solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, ethyl acetate, glycol ethers, and acetone
 Motivated by cost, environmental concerns, and regulation, the paint and coating industries are increasingly shifting towards aqueous solvents
 Chlorofluorocarbons, which are banned or highly regulated, were widely used cleaning products and refrigerants
 Tetrachloroethene is used widely in dry cleaning and by industry
 The use of fossil fuels produces vocs either directly as products or indirectly as byproducts
 One VOC that is a known human carcinogen is benzene, which is a chemical found in environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels, and exhaust from cars
 Benzene also has natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires
 It is frequently used to make other chemicals in the production of plastics, resins, and synthetic fibers
 Benzene evaporates into the air quickly and the vapor of benzene is heavier than air allowing the compound to sink into low-lying areas
 Benzene has also been known to contaminate food and water and if digested can lead to vomiting, dizziness, sleepiness, rapid heartbeat, and at high levels, even death may occur
 Methylene chloride is another VOC that is highly dangerous to human health
 It can be found in adhesive removers and aerosol spray paints and the chemical has been proven to cause cancer in animals
 In the human body, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide and a person will suffer the same symptoms as exposure to carbon monoxide
 If a product that contains methylene chloride needs to be used the best way to protect human health is to use the product outdoors
 If it must be used indoors, proper ventilation is essential to keeping exposure levels down
 Perchloroethylene is a volatile organic compound that has been linked to causing cancer in animals
 It is also suspected to cause many of the breathing related symptoms of exposure to vocs
 Perchloroethylene is used mostly in dry cleaning
 While dry cleaners recapture perchloroethylene in the dry cleaning process to reuse it, some environmental release is unavoidable
 Studies show that people breathe in low levels of this VOC in homes where dry-cleaned clothes are stored and while wearing dry-cleaned clothing
 MTBE was banned in the US around 2004 in order to limit further contamination of drinking water aquifers primarily from leaking underground gasoline storage tanks where MTBE was used as an octane booster and oxygenated-additive
 Since many people spend much of their time indoors, long-term exposure to vocs in the indoor environment can contribute to sick building syndrome
 In offices, VOC results from new furnishings, wall coverings, and office equipment such as photocopy machines, which can off-gas vocs into the air
 Good ventilation and air-conditioning systems are helpful at reducing vocs in the indoor environment
 Studies also show that relative leukemia and lymphoma can increase through prolonged exposure of vocs in the indoor environment
 In the United States, there are two standardized methods for measuring vocs, one by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and another by Occupational Safety and Health Administration
 Each method uses a single component solvent; butanol and hexane cannot be sampled, however, on the same sample matrix using the NIOSH or OSHA method
 The aromatic VOC compound benzene, emitted from exhaled cigarette smoke is labeled as carcinogenic, and is ten times higher in smokers than in nonsmokers
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency has found concentrations of vocs in indoor air to be 2 to 5 times greater than in outdoor air and sometimes far greater
 During certain activities indoor levels of vocs may reach 1,000 times that of the outside air
 Studies have shown that individual VOC emissions by themselves are not that high in an indoor environment, but the indoor total VOC concentrations can be up to five times higher than the VOC outdoor levels
 New buildings especially, contribute to the highest level of VOC off-gassing in an indoor environment because of the abundant new materials generating VOC particles at the same time in such a short time period
 In addition to new buildings, we also use many consumer products that emit VOC compounds, VOC concentration in an indoor environment during winter is three to four times higher than the VOC concentrations during the summer
 High indoor VOC levels are attributed to the low rates of air exchange between the indoor and outdoor environment as a result of tight-shut windows and the increasing use of humidifiers
 In most countries, a separate definition of vocs is used with regard to indoor air quality that comprises each organic chemical compound that can be measured as follows: Adsorption from air on Tenax TA, thermal desorption, gas chromatographic separation over a 100% nonpolar column
 VOC are all compounds that appear in the gas chromatogram between and including n-hexane and n-hexadecane
 Compounds appearing earlier are called VVOC compounds appearing later are called SVOC
 See also these standards: ISO 16000-6, ISO 13999-2, VDI 4300-6, German agbb evaluating scheme, German dibt approval scheme, GEV testing method for the emicode
some overviews over VOC emissions rating schemes have been collected and compared
 France, Germany and Belgium have enacted regulations to limit VOC emissions from commercial products, and industry has developed numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems, such as EMICODE, M1, Blue Angel and Indoor Air Comfort In the United States, several standards exist; California Standard CDPH Section 01350 is the most popular one
 Over the last few decades, these regulations and standards changed the marketplace, leading to an increasing number of low-emitting products: The leading voluntary labels report that licenses to several hundreds of low-emitting products have been issued 
 Many building materials such as paints, adhesives, wall boards, and ceiling tiles slowly emit formaldehyde, which irritates the mucous membranes and can make a person irritated and uncomfortable
 Formaldehyde emissions from wood are in the range of 0
02 - 0
04 ppm
 Relative humidity within an indoor environment can also affect the emissions of formaldehyde
 High relative humidity and high temperatures allow more vaporization of formaldehyde from wood-materials
 Respiratory, allergic, or immune effects in infants or children are associated with man-made vocs and other indoor or outdoor air pollutants
 Some vocs, such as styrene and limonene, can react with nitrogen oxides or with ozone to produce new oxidation products and secondary aerosols, which can cause sensory irritation symptoms
 Unspecified vocs are important in the creation of smog
 Health effects include eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches, loss of coordination, nausea; damage to liver, kidney, and central nervous system
 Some organics can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans
 Key signs or symptoms associated with exposure to vocs include conjunctival irritation, nose and throat discomfort, headache, allergic skin reaction, dyspnea, declines in serum cholinesterase levels, nausea, vomiting, nose bleeding, fatigue, dizziness
 The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effects
 As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed
 Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics
 At present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes
 Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; Some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans
 To reduce exposure to these toxins, one should buy products that contain low-vocs or No vocs
 Only the quantity which will soon be needed should be purchased, eliminating stockpiling of these chemicals
 Use products with vocs in well ventilated areas
 When designing homes and buildings, design teams can implement the best possible ventilation plans, call for the best mechanical systems available, and design assemblies to reduce the amount of infiltration into the building
 These methods will help improve indoor air quality, but by themselves they cannot keep a building from becoming an unhealthy place to breathe
 Limit values for VOC emissions into indoor air are published by eg agbb, AFSSET, California Department of Public Health, and others
 These regulations have prompted several companies to adapt with VOC level reductions in products that have vocs in their formula, such Benjamin Moore & Co
 in the paint industry and weld-on in the adhesive industry
 The exhaled human breath contains a few hundred volatile organic compounds and is used in breath analysis to serve as a VOC biomarker to test for diseases such as lung cancer
 One study has shown that "volatile organic compounds 


 are mainly blood borne and therefore enable monitoring of different processes in the body
" And it appears that VOC compounds in the body "may be either produced by metabolic processes or inhaled / absorbed from exogenous sources" such as environmental tobacco smoke
 Research is still in the process to determine whether vocs in the body are contributed by cellular processes or by the cancerous tumors in the lung or other organs
 vocs in the environment or certain atmospheres can be detected based on different principles and interactions between the organic compounds and the sensor components
 There are electronic devices that can detect ppm concentrations despite the non-selectivity
 Others can predict with reasonable accuracy the molecular structure of the volatile organic compounds in the environment or enclosed atmospheres and could be used as accurate monitors of the chemical fingerprint and further as health monitoring devices
 Solid-phase microextraction techniques are used to collect vocs at low concentrations for analysis
 Direct injection mass spectrometry techniques are frequently utilized for the rapid detection and accurate quantification of vocs
 PTR-MS is among the methods that have been used most extensively for the on-line analysis of biogenic and antropogenic vocs
 Recent PTR-MS instruments based on time-of-flight mass spectrometry have been reported to reach detection limits of 20 pptv after 100 ms and 750 ppqv after 1 min measurement time
 The mass resolution of these devices is between 7000 and 10,500 m / Δm, thus it is possible to separate the most common isobaric vocs and quantify them independently

 e aar rahamaan Delhi 6 - is a Hindi film produced by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra; It stars Abhishek Bachchan, Sonam Kapoor, Om Puri, Waheeda Rehman, Rishi Kapoor, Atul Kulkarni, Deepak Dobriyal and Divya Dutta
 yah film puraani dilli main chandani chowk kshetra main mehara ke badhate hue varshon par aadhaarit he
 This is Mehra's third film after Aks and Rang De Basanti
 yah film 20 farvari 2009 ko release hui, isane bahut acha box offis collection kiya, lekin aalochakon kii ore se ise mishrit samiksha hi praapt hui
 The film begins with the birth of a hero
 saath hi gende kaa phool=marigold bhi dikhaaya jaataa he
 When Annapurna returns to her old home in Old Delhi, the ceremony is celebrated with much pomp
 roshan shuru main kai padosiyon kii bheed se pareshaan ho jaataa he, ye padosi hai: ali bag punarjagran purush, ek duusare se hameshaa ladate rahane vaale bhai madanagopal or jayagopal, unki patniyaan or parivaar, mamdu or halwai, gobar anaadi, seth ji or kai anya log
 However, Roshan finally feels relaxed in this place and wholeheartedly embraces the sense of community present here
 vah ramlila main apni daadi kaa saath detaa he, mamdu kii mithai kii dukaan par khadaa rahata he, bacchon ke saath kheltaa he or dhire dhire is sthaan kii samskruti main dub jaataa he
 Roshan also slowly comes into contact with some limited realities
 jab annapurna behosh ho jaati he or ve use jaldi se aspataal le jane kii koshish karte hai, us samay vah paata he ki sadak par trephic jam he, kyonki ek gaay vahaan bachhda de rahi hoti he, jise pavitra samaaroh maan kar log us gaay ke chaaron ore ikatthe ho jate hai; use baad main or bhi hairaani hoti he jab uski behosh daadi ko khinch kar log gaay kaa aashirwad dilaane ke liye le jate hai; or vah bhounchakka rah jaataa he jab sthaneey police logon ke is vyavhaar ko protsaahit karti he
 Roshan begins to understand the conflicts and social issues present in the community
 madanagopal kii bahan rama avivaahit he or jayagopal kaa bijli kaa vyapaar nahin chal rahaa he
 Ayyash old old moneylender Lala Bhairam marries a young girl, who is having an affair with Suresh, who runs a young photo studio
 suresh doharaa khel khel rahaa he, vah madanagopal kii beti bittu ke bhi peeche he
 Bittu secretly wants to flee from Old Delhi; She quietly prepares to audition for the popular reality show Indian Idol, hoping to win and open her way to Mumbai
 roshan ali bag kii shahari pasand kii taareef karata he or vah yah jaan kar hairaan ho jaataa he ki ali bag ne kai saal pehle apni maa ko taiyaar kar liya or uske baad se usne kabhi shaadi nahin kii or roshan nichi jati kii kooda binane vaali ladki jalebi ke saath sahanubhuti dikhaata he, jo chuaachhut kaa saamana kar rahi he, ab kuch sthaneey log uske saath ho jate hai
 Roshan crosses the path with the rude Inspector Rannvijay, who persecutes the locals, gets the majority of the local gathering, which is made up of women who demonstrate political ability at every opportunity
 isi bich, media main daraavnee khabaren aane lagati hai jo "kaala bandar " ke aatank se sambandhit hai
 This creature attacks people, steals many things and causes the death of many innocent people
 baharlaal, sthaneey samachar kaale bandar kii har gatividhi par nazar rakhte he or iske karnaamon ke bare main bataate rahete hai
 Jaigopal, who considers himself a genius in electronics, states that a black monkey can be an electric circuit and can be cut with water; This rumor spreads quickly in the area
 film main kai mode aate hai
 After some initial conflict, Roshan and Bittu become closer to each other
 roshan us samay hastkshep karata he jab madanagopal bittu kii shaadi karwaane kii koshish karata he or ladke vaale use dekhne aate hai
 He reveals Bittu's dreams to him; This leaves the boys who have come to see him, and Madangopal gets angry at him
 use dhire dhire bittu se pyaar ho jaataa he, lekin vah us samay bhramit ho jaataa he jab bittu suresh ke liye apane pyaar ko jaahir karti he
 
 isi samay kaala bandar puraani dilli par hamalaa karata he
 Local people with simple thoughts call Tantric Shani Baba to end the demonic influence of the black monkey
 ek lambe havan samaaroh fake baad, tantric baba bataate he ki sthaneey masjid, ko banane ke liye mandir ko dhwast kar diya gaya, isi kaaran kaale bandar kii buree aatma sabko pareshaan kar rahi he
 This creates a sense of enmity between the Hindu and Muslim communities
 praarambhik shantipurna pradarshnon ke baad, kai log bheed main hinsaatmak aacharan karne lagate hai, sthaneey galiyon main hinsa bhadak uthati he
 Mammadu sets fire to the temple of the tree
 roshan shanti banane kii koshish karata he, lekin uske mishrit dharmik pitrutv ke kaaran use asweekruti kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 The locals eventually begin to believe that the black monkey is hidden in a lonely street, and must be destroyed
 ve anaadi gobar ko bure shatru se baalo kaa ek guchha laane kaa nirdesh dete hai taaki tantric ise jala sake or apni bhoot bhagane kii jhaad-phoonk kii prakriya ko puraa kar sake
 Roshan learns that Bittu is planning to elope with Suresh and Suresh is playing a double game
 vah bandar kaa mukhauta or bandar kii poshaak pahan kar chupake se bittu kaa peechha karata hua chat par jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Gobar arrives at Soo Gali where Jalebi gives him a bunch of hair and he returns to bring peace to the community
 usee samay, roshan bittu or suresh ke paas pahunch jaataa he, jisase suresh dar kar bhaag jaataa he
 Before Roshan takes off his mask, Bittu shouts, causing angry people to gather
 unhen lagata he ki roshan hi kaala bandar he, ve uski khub pitayee karte hai or mamdu us par goli chalata he
 Then, Gobar brings the shocking thing about the truth of Kala Bandar, he reveals that Kala Bandar is indeed a problem inhabiting the people of Delhi 6 and people have to defeat it themselves
 vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaaon main yah afvaah fail gayi ki rakesh apni agali film main nae chehron ko lene vaale hai

 Rakesh Omprakash Mehra said that Abhishek Bachchan is always his first choice for Delhi 6

 panzia, panjeya yaa panji, ek vishaal ekikrut mahadweep tha jiskaa astitv lagbhag 250 million varsh pehle peliojoik or mizozoik yug ke dauraan tha; maujuuda mahadweep apane vartmaan swaroop main isi main se nikal kar aaye hai
 The name was coined in the scientific discussion of Alfred Wegener's theory of continental flow
 apni pustak "da origin of continents and oshans" main unhone mana tha ki sabhi mahadweep baad main vikhandit hone or pravaahit hokar apane vartmaan sthanon par pahunchne se pehle ek samay main ek vishaal mahadweep kaa hissaa the jise unhone "uracontinent" kaha tha
 The term Pangea came to light in 1928 during a symposium held to discuss Alfred Wegener's theory
 ek vishaal mahaasaagar jo panzia ko chaaron ore se ghere hue tha, tadnusaar uskaa naam panthalasa rakhaa gaya
 It seems that the fragmentation and origin of the vast continents is consecutive in the history of the Earth's 4
6 billion years
 panzia se pehle kai anya nirmaan bhi hue ho sakate hai
 Last to second, Panotia was formed 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic Eoin and existed until 540 ma
 panotia se pehle rodenia astitv main tha jo lagbhag 1
1 billian varshon pehle se lekar 750 million varshon pehle tak maujuud rahaa tha
 Rhodinia was formed by the deposition and joining of fragments resulting from the fragmentation of an old massive continent called Columbia or Nuna, built in the period 2
0–1
8 GA
 rodenia ke sateek vinyas or jeeyodynamiks itihaas ko utani behatar tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he jitna panotia or panzia ko
jab rodenia kaa vikhandan hua to yah teen tukdon main bant gaya: proto-loresia kaa vishaal mahadweep, proto-gondvanaa kaa vishaal mahadweep or apekshaakrit chota congou creton
 proto-loresia or proto-gondvanaland ko proto-tethis mahaasaagar ne alag-alag kar diya tha
 Laurentia, Siberia and the Baltic continents were formed soon after proto-laurentia itself split and separated
 isaki daraar se do nae mahasaagaron, ipitas mahaasaagar or pelioasian mahaasaagar kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 The Baltic was located east of Laurentia and north-east of Siberia Laurentia
 600 eme ke aasapaas in mahasaagaron main se zyaadaatar ne waapas ek saath milakar ek apekshaakrit alpaayu vishaal mahadweep panotia kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen dhruvon ke paas badi maatra main jameen or bumadhya rekha ke paas dhruviya mahasaagaron ko jodne vaali sirf ek apekshaakrit choti pattee shaamil thi
 Only 6040 years after its origin, about 540 ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian era Panotia disintegrated, giving rise to the southern continent of Laurentia, the Baltic, and Gondwana
 cambrian kaal main laurenshia kaa swatantra mahadweep, jo uttari america bana, yah teen ore se ghire simaankit mahasaagaron ke saath bumadhya rekha par sthit ho gaya: uttar or pashchim main panthalasik mahaasaagar, dakshin main ipitas mahaasaagar or purv main khantee mahaasaagar
 pracheenatam ordovisian main 480 eme ke aasapaas evalonia kaa chota mahadweep, ek jameen kaa hissaa jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america, nova scotia or england bana, gondvanaa se mukt ho gaya or isane laurenshia kii ore apana safar shuru kar diya
 The Baltic, Laurentia, and Avalonia all united together by the end of the Ordovician period, thus forming a small continent near the Iapetus Ocean called Euramerica or Laurecia
 takkar ke parinaam swaroop uttari epalachiyans kii bhi utpatti hui
 siberia do mahadwipon ke bich khantee mahaasaagar ke saath uramerica ke nikat sthit ho gaya
 When all these incidents were happening, Gondwana slowly slipped towards the South Pole
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa pehla charan tha
 The second phase of Pangea's genesis was Euramerica's collision with Gondwana
 By the Silurian period, 440 MA, the Baltic had already collided with Laurentia to form Euramerica
 evalonia abhi tak laurenshia se nahin takaraayaa tha or unke bich ek samudri maarg, ipitas mahaasaagar kaa ek avshesh abhi tak sikud rahaa tha kyonki evalonia dhire-dhire laurenshia kii ore khisakane laga tha
 Meanwhile southern Europe fragmented from Gondwana and the newly formed rake began to move across the ocean towards Euramerica and collided with the southern Baltic in the Devonian, although this small continent was in the form of an underwater strip
 ipitas mahaasaagar kii shakha khantee mahaasaagar bhi siberia se ek dweepiya vrutt ke rup main sikud rahaa tha jo purvi baltic se takaraa gaya
 a new ocean, the Ural Ocean, was present behind this island
 silurian kaal ke ant main uttar or dakshin china gondvanaa se dur chale gaye or sikudte hue proto-tethis mahaasaagar ke paar uttar kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or iske dakshini sire par nayaa peleo-tethis mahaasaagar khul rahaa tha
 In the Devonian period, Gondwana itself started moving towards Euramerica, causing the Rake Ocean to shrink
 praarambhik carbonipheras yug main uttar-pashchim africa ne uramerica ke dakshin-purvi tat ko chhu liya tha jisase epalchian parvaton or messeta parvaton ke dakshini hisson kaa nirmaan hona shuru ho gaya tha
 South America moved northward towards southern Euramerica while the eastern parts of Gondwana started moving from the equator to the south pole
 uttari china or dakshini china swatantra mahadwipon par sthit the
 The small continent Kazakhstania collided with Siberia in the Middle Carboniferous era
 pashchimi kazakhstania carbonipheras yug ke ant main baltic se takaraayaa jisase unke bich ural mahaasaagar kaa sampark band ho gaya karne or unamem pashchimi proto-tethis ural parvaton or vishaal mahadweep loresia kii utpatti kaa kaaran bana
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa antim charan tha
 Meanwhile, South America collided with southern Laurentia, closing the rake ocean and forming the southernmost part of the Appalachians and Ouachita Mountains
 is samay tak gondvanaa dakshini dhruv ke paas sthit ho gaya tha or antarctic, bharat, australia, dakshin africa or dakshin america main glaciaron kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Part of northern China had collided with Siberia by the end of the Carboniferous era and thus the proto-tethys Ocean was completely closed
 parmian yug kii shuruyaat main cimerian plate gondvanaa se vikhandit hokar alag ho gayi or yah loresia kii ore badhane lagi jisase iske dakshini sire par ek nayaa mahaasaagar, tethis mahaasaagar nirmit ho gaya or plato-tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya
 Most of the terrain was still integrated
 trysic kaal main panzia thodaa sa dakshin-pashchim disha main gum gaya tha
 The Cimmerian plate was still crossing the shrinking paleo-tethys which continued until the middle of the Jurassic period
 The paleo-tethys was closed from west to east, thus creating the Cimmerian Orogeny
 panzia angreji ke "si " akshar kii tarah dikhaai detaa tha jisamen si ke andar ek mahaasaagar, nayaa tethis mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Pangea had cracked by the middle of the Jurassic period, its fragmentation is given below
 panzia ke jeevashm-pramaan main mahadwipon par paayi jane vaali ek jaisi or abhinn prajatiyon kii maujuudagi shaamil he jo ab kaaphi dur chale gaye hai
 For example, fossils of therapsid Listerosaurus are found in South Africa, India and Australia, along with members of the Glossopteris flora that would have extended from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their current positions; Similarly, the freshwater reptile Mizosaurus is found only in the local areas of the coasts of Brazil and West Africa
 panzia ke atirikt pramaan dakshin america ke purvi tat or africa ke pashchimi tat ke bich bhuvaigyanik rujhaanon ke milan sahit isse sate mahadwipon ke bhugarbha main paae jate hai
 The polar ice layer of the Carboniferous period covered the southern end of Pangea

 Since the magnetic poles tilt toward recurring poles occur only over a period of a few thousand years, measurements are averaged over several lavas of several thousand years to determine a clear average polarity position
 talchhati chattaanon or ghuspaithi aagney chattaanon ke namoonon main ek chumbakeey jhukaav hota he jo aam taur par chumbakeey uttar ke jhukaav main in 'ek saamaan badlaavon' kaa ek ausat hota he kyonki unke chumbakeey kshetra turant nahin ban jate hai jaisaa ki thande ho rahe lava ke maamle main hota he
 The magnetic variations between sample groups that have a difference of millions of years in age are due to a combined real polarity deviation and movement of continents

 panzia ke vikhandan kaa teesraa mahatvapurn or antim charan praarambhik sinojoik yug main puraa hua
 Lauresia was separated when North America / Greenland was liberated from Eurasia and in about 60–55 MA it opened the Norwegian Sea
 The Atlantic and Indian Ocean continued to expand and the Tethys Ocean's route was closed

 The city of Los Angeles is also the administrative headquarters of Los Angeles County and is the most densely populated and highly diverse county in the United States

 Los Angeles was founded in 1781 by Spanish Governor Felipe de Neve

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions
