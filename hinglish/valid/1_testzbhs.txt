 GDP can be defined in three ways, all of which are conceptually similar
 pehla, yah ek nishchit samay avadhi main ek desh ke bheetar utpaadit sabhi antim maal or sevaao ke liye kiye gaye kul vyay ke baraabar he
 Second, it is equal to the sum of the total value added at each stage of production and subsidized tax on products by all industries within a country within a period
 teesraa, yah ek avadhi main desh main utpaadan ke dwaara utpann aay ke yoga ke baraabar he- arthath karmchaariyon kii kshatipurti kii raashi, utpaadan par kar aurasabsidi rahit aayaat or sakal parichaalan adhishesh The most common method of measuring and simply determining GDP is the expenditure or expenditure method: "sakal" kaa arth he sakal gharelu utpaada main se puunji share ke moolyahras ko ghataya nahin gaya he
 If the net investment is replaced by the gross investment in the above equation, the formula for net domestic product is obtained
 is sameekaran main upbhog or nivesh antim maal or sevaao par kiye jane vaale vyay hai
 The export-import part of the equation adjusts by subtracting the portion of expenditure not generated domestically and adding it back to the domestic sector

 Theoretical macroeconomics has two advantages in dividing total consumption in this way: africa · uttar americadakshin america · asiaurope · oshinia Microeconomics · Macroeconomics: History of economic ideas

 Spending on new housing by a household is also included in the investment

 Purchases of financial products are classified as 'savings', not as investments
 vibhed spasht he: yadi dhan ko maal yaa sevaao main badla jaataa he, yah nivesh he ; lekin, yadi aap ek bond yaa stoke kaa ek share kharidte hai, yah hastantaran bhugtan GDP se alag kar diya jaataa he
 So stocks and bonds indirectly affect GDP
 haalaanki aise kray ko saamaanya bhashaa main nivesh hi kaha jaataa he, kul aarthik drushtikon se yah keval anubandhon kaa vinimay he or vaastavik utpaadan yaa GDP kaa hissaa nahin he
 It does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits
 C, I, g or NX ke udhaaharan : yadi aap apane hotel ke navinikaran ke liye dhan kharch karte hai, taaki adhibhog kii daron main vruddhi ho, to yah nijee nivesh he, lekin yadi aap aisa hi karne ke liye ek sangh main share kharidte hai ta yah bachat he
 The former is used when measuring GDP, not the latter
 lekin, jab sangh naveekaran par apane swayan ke kharch karata he, tab is kharch ko GDP main shaamil kiya jayega
 For example, if a hotel is a private home, then the renewal expense will be considered consumption, but if a government agency is converting the hotel into an office of civil services, the renewal expense will be considered a part of the public sector expenditure
 yadi navinikaran main videsh se ek jhumar kii kharid shaamil he, to vyay kii gananaa bhi aayaat kii vruddhi ke rup main kii jaati he, taaki NX kaa maan gir jaae or kul GDP kray ke dwaara prabhavit hota he
 If a domestic manufacturer is paid to build a chandelier for a foreign hotel, the situation will be reverse and the payment will be calculated in NX
 Again, GDP measures output through expenditure; If the chandelier generated was domestically purchased, it would have been included in the GDP figures when it was purchased by a consumer or business, but because it was exported to give the domestically generated amount It is necessary to "fix" the amount consumed domestically

 Calculating real GDP growth helps economists determine whether production has decreased or increased, unaffected by changes in the purchasing power of the currency

 GDP pays attention to where the out put is originating, not who is producing it
 GDP sabhi gharelu utpaadanon kaa maapan karata he chaahe isaki utpaadan icaayiyon kii rashtriyata koi bhi ho
 In contrast, GNP measures the value of an out put generated by the 'nationality' of a region
 GNP is baat par dhyaan detaa he ki utpaadan kaa maalik koun he
 For example, in the United States, GNP measures the value of out put produced by American companies regardless of where they are located
 Year-on-year, actual GNP growth in 2007 was 3
2%

 For more information, see National Income and Production Measurement prati vyakti GDP ek arthvyavastha main jivan str kaa maap nahin he
 However, it is often used as an indicator of this kind, on the argument that all citizens will benefit from the increased economic output of their country
 isi prakaar, GDP prati vyakti vyaktigat aay kaa maap nahin he
 GDP can increase even if the income of most of the citizens of a country decreases or if it changes in proportion

 The key benefit of GDP per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured repeatedly, consistently and widely; Frequent means that most countries provide information on GDP on a quarterly basis, meaning that some measure of GDP is widely available for every country in the world, and the technical definitions used consistently within GDP, countries
 And are relatively stable, and therefore there is a belief that equal measurement is being done in each country
 jivan str ke ek sanketak ke rup main GDP kaa upyog karne kaa ek mukhya nuksaan yah he ki yah kadai ke saath jivan str kaa maap nahin he
 GDP measures a specific type of economic activity in a country
 GDP kii paribhaasha ke anusaar aisa jaruri nahin he ki yah yah jivan str kaa maap kare
 For example, in an extreme example, a country that exported 100 percent of its production and did not import anything would still have a high GDP, but a very low standard of living
 GDP ke upyog ke paksh main tark nahin he ki yah jivan str kaa ek acha sanketak he, lekin iske bajaay yah he ki jivan str us sthiti main badhane kii pravriti rakhata he jab GDP prati vyakti badhata he
 This makes GDP representative rather than a direct measure of standard of living

 There are many controversies about this use of GDP
 GDP kaa prayog arthshaastriyon ke dwaara arthvyavastha ke swasthya ke maapan ke liye vyapak rup se kiya jaataa he, kyonki isaki kismon ko saapeksh rup se tunrat pahachaanaa jaataa he
 However, its value as an indicator of standard of living is considered limited
 GDP kaa upyog kaise kiya jaataa he, isaki aalochanaon main shaamil hai: In fact, a short-term increase in income inequality can be a factor in long-term reduction in income inequality

 atah yah bhautik kanon hetu saamaanya he, jahaan poor urja praayah paraspar badalte rahete hai, ev / c2 yaa saraltar ev ko bhaar kii ikai hetu prayog karte hue
 For example, 1
022 mev of energy can be obtained by eradicating the load of both an electron and a cube, 0
511 mev / c2, the mass of the electron is 0
938 gev / c2, making gev / c2 a very convenient unit of particle physics
 tulana hetu: Transfer factor: ek prakashanu ke urja E, aavriti f or tarangadairghy λ kaa sambandh he: Where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light
 For example, the spectrum of direct light consists of waves ranging from 400 nm to 700 nm
 pratyaksh prakaash ke prakashanuon main urjaaen hoti hai: to ek electron volt ek adhorakt photone kii bhi urja hoti he, jisaki tarangadairghy lagbhag 1240 nm he
 Similarly, 10ev energy is ultraviolet wavelength 124 nm and more

 mongol fuj ne pichley 13 din se baghdad ko ghere main le rakhaa tha
 jab pratirodh kii tamaam ummiden dam tod gayi to 10 farvari san 1258 ko samarpan ke darvaaze khul gaye
 The 37th Abbasi Khalifa Mustaasim Billah, along with his ministers and officers, came to the main door and laid arms in front of Halaku Khan
 halaaku ne vahi kiya jo uske dada changez khan pichhali aadhi sadi se karte chale aae the
 usne caliph ke alaava tamaam aalaa ohadedaaron ko maut ke ghat utaar diya or mongol sena baghdad main daakhil ho gai
 What happened till the next few days can be estimated from the words of historian Abdullah Vassaf Shirazi
 vah likhte hai, "wo shahar main bhukhe gadhon kii tarah ghus gaye or jis tarah bhukhe bhediye bhedon par hamalaa karti hai vaisaa karne lage
 bistar or takie chaakuon se faad die gaye
 mahal kii auraten galiyon main ghasiti gayi or unamem se har ek taatariyon kaa khilonaa banakar rah gayi
" Settled on both sides of the Tigris River was the city of Baghdad, the city of Alif Laila, the city of Khalifa Harun Alarsheed
 It is difficult to estimate exactly how many people fell victim to this murder
 Historians estimate that between 2 lakh and 10 lakh people were killed with sword, arrow or spear
 itihaas kii kitabon main likhaa he ki baghdad kii galiyaan laashon se ati padi thim
 chand dinon ke andar-andar unase uthne vaali sadaandh kii vajah se halaaku khan ko shahar se baahar tamboo lagane par majaboor hona padaa
 At the same time, when the huge palace was set on fire, the precious wood smell of ebony and sandalwood used in it was found in the stench spreading in the surrounding environment
 It is said that the Matiala water of that river kept flowing in red for a few days and then turned blue
 laal rang kii vajah wo koon tha jo galiyon se bah-bahakar nadi main miltaa rahaa or siyaahi is vajah se ki shahar ke sainkadon pustakaalayon main mahafooz durlabh nuskhe nadi main phenk die gaye the or unki siyaahi ne ghul-ghulkar nadi ke laal rang ko halkaa kar diya tha
 The elder poet of the Persian, Sheikh Saadi, had lived in Baghdad for quite some time and he had studied in the madrasa Nizamia here
 Therefore, he wrote a memorable commentary on the fall of Baghdad, every lion of which stirs the heart
 halaaku khan ne 29 janvari san 1257 ko baghdad kii gheraabandi kii shuruyaat kii thi
 hamale se pehle halaaku ne caliph ko likhaa tha, "lohe ke sue ko mukka maarane kii koshish na karo
 suraj ko buji hui mombatti samajhane kii galati na karo
 baghdad kii deevaaren foran gira do
 uski khaaiyaan paat do, hukumat chhod do or hamaare paas aa jaao
 agar hamane baghdad par chadhaai kii to tumhen na gahare pataal main panaah milegi or na oonche aasmaan main
" 37th Abbasi Khalifa Mustaasim Billah did not have the glory that came from his ancestors
 But still his coinage ran on most parts of the Muslim world and the caliph had the power that all Muslims from Marakash to Iran stood up to him after hearing the news of the attack on him
 isliye caliph ne halaaku ko jawaab main likhaa, "noujvaan, das din kii khushkismati se tum khud ko brahmad kaa maalik samajhane lage ho
 mere paas purab se pashchim tak khuda ko maanane vaali janata he
 salaamati se laut jaao
" Halaku Khan had full faith in the ability of his Mongol soldiers and had migrated from his country Mongolia during the last four years to four thousand miles away and had made large parts of the world his own
 baghdad par hamale kii taiyaariyon ke dauraan na sirf halaaku khan ke bhai mongu khan ne nae sainik daste bhijwaaye the balki armenia or georgia se kaasi sankhya main isaai faujen bhi unke saath aa mili thim jo musalamaanon se salibi jangon main purab kii haar kaa badla lene ke liye betaab thim
 Not only this, Mongol army was much bigger and more modern in technical terms
 The Mongol army had a unit of Chinese engineers who specializes in the use of gunpowder
 baghdad ke log un tiron ke bare main jaanate the jin par aag lagaakar phenkaa jaataa tha lekin barood se unka kabhi vaasta nahin padaa tha

 unke kahani-sansar se iskaa sansar sarvatha nisanssang he, isliye unki kahaniyon se parichit logon ke liye yah anbujh paheli ho jaati he, premchand ke sambandh main bani hui purvavarti dharna ke aahe prashrachihn laga detii he
 This is a story about values
 aadhuniktaa ke saare mudde isamen mil jate hai
 This is the first story of modernism
 yahi kaaran he kuch vidwaan ise pragativaadee kehete hai to doindranath madan kaa kahana he-kahani jis satya ko ujagar karti he vah jivan ke tathy se mail nahin khaataa
 Kafan is the story associated with Premchand's point of life beyond which there is no point
 dobchchan singh ke matanusaar- yah unke jivan kaa hi kafan nahin siddh hui balki unke sanchit aadarshon, mulyon, aasthaaon or vishwaason kaa bhi kafan siddh hui
 While Dr
 Paramanand Srivastava says that 


 Kafan is the first new story in Hindi, it is completely modern because it has neither the familiar idealistic realism of Premchand, nor the pre-scriptural notion, nor the fabricated instrumentals
 As the characters are, no culmination, no climax, no shallow sentimentality and exaggeration, nor any direct communication
 vah lekhak ke badale hue drushtikon or kahani kii badali hui sanrachana kaa thos udhaaharan he
 It starts like this - both father and son are sitting silently in front of an extinguished bonfire at the door of the hut and inside, the son's young wife Budhia was outpacing childbirth
 rah-rahakar uske munh se aisi dil hilaa dene vaali awaz nikalati thi ki donon kalejaa tham lete the
 It was a winter night, nature was immersed in silence, the whole village was turned into darkness
 jab nisang bhav se kahata he ki vah bachegi nahin to madhav chidhkar uttar detaa he ki maranaa he to jaldi hi kyon nahin mar jaati-dekhakar bhi vah kya kar legaa
 It seems as if at the beginning of the story, Premchand is gesturing in a symbolic manner and the sentiment is getting dark in the dark as if there is a deepening darkness of the capitalist system which rises from the ruthless sense of all human values, harmony and intimacy Is going
 is aurat ne ghar ko ek vyavastha di thi, pisai karke yaa ghaas chhilakar vah in donon bagaiyraton kaa dojakh bharti rahi he
 And today both of them are waiting that if they die, then sleep comfortably
 akashavriti par jinda rahane vaale baap-bete ke liye bhune hue aaluon kii keemat us marati hui aurat se zyada he
 None of them wants to go to see him for fear that another man will eat all the potatoes after he leaves
 halak or taalu jal jane kii chintaa kiye bina jis teji se ve garm aalu kha rahe hai usase unki maarak garibi kaa anumaan sahaj hi ho jaataa he
 This discrepancy is ironically associated with the entire structure of the story
 ghisu ko bees saal pehle hui thakur kii baraat yaad aati he-chatnee, rhita, teen tarah ke sookhe saag, ek rasedaar tarkari, dahi, chatnee, mithai
 Now, what should i tell you about the taste of that meal? 


logon ne aisa khaaya, kisi se pani na piya gaya
 


 yah varnan apane byore main kaaphi aakarshak hi nahin balki bhojan ke prati pathakeey samvednaa ko dhardaar bana detaa he
 After this Premchand writes - and Budhia was still moaning
 is prakaar thakur kii baraat kaa varnan amanviyata ko thos banane main puri sahaayta karata he
 The Shroud is the story of a social system that discourages man towards labor because he does not show any significance of that labor
 kyonki jis samaaj main raat-din mehnat karne waalon kii haalat unki haalat se bahut-kuch acchhee nahin thi or kisaanon ke mukaable main ve log, jo kisaanon kii durbalataaon se laabh uthaanaa jaanate the, kahin zyada sampann the, vahaan is tarah kii manovriti kaa paidaa ho janaa koi achraj kii baat na thi
 


 Even then, he was aware that if he is in trouble, then at least he does not have to work hard for the farmers
 uski saralata or nirihata se duusare log beza phayda to nahin uthaate
 For twenty years, this system keeps a man without food for his stomach, so it is not necessary that he has to worry more than a member of his family to die
 aurat ke mar jane par kafan kaa chanda haath main aane par unki niyat badalane lagati he, halke se kafan kii baat par donon ekamat ho jate hai ki laash uthte-uthte raat ho jaayegi
 Who watches the shroud at night? The shroud is burnt with the corpse
 or phir us halke kafan ko liye bina hi ye log us kafan ke chande ke paise ko sharaab, pudiyon, chatnee, achaar or kalegiyon par kharch kar dete hai
 From the satisfaction of their food, both of them imagine the salvation of Budhia - if our soul is happy, will it not get happiness
 jarur se jarur milegaa
 God, you are the conscience
 use baikuntha le janaa
 The happiness of our soul is necessary first, there is a need for the happiness of the world and God even later
 apni umr ke anuroop ghisu zyada samajhadaar he
 He knows that people will arrange the shroud - even if the money does not come in his hand this time
 When Madhav starts crying while thinking of the immense suffering of his wife, Ghisu silences her - using our traditional knowledge that She is freed after dying
 or is janjaal se chhot gayi he
 Drunk, dancing, jumping, jumping, oblivious and intoxicated from all sides, they fall and pile up there

 After sorting out the scattered references of Swamiji's only available mathematical treatise 'vedic Mathematics' or 'sixteen Simple Mathematical Formulas of the Vedas', Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Agarwal has given the list of sutras and sub-sutras at the beginning of the book as follows- is sutara kaa shabdic arth he : 'pehle vaale kii tulana main ek adhik se'
