 With the exception of the Battle of Tabok, Ali took part in all the wars and campaigns fought for Islam
 saath hi un ladaaiyon main maanak dharak hone ke naate, ali ne yoddhaon ke pakshiyon ko dushman bhoomi main chaape par netritv kiya
 Ali first distinguished himself as a warrior in 624 at the Battle of Badar
 umayad champion walid ebn utta ko haraakar ali ne ladaai shuru kii; ek itihaaskaar ne yuddh main ali kii udghaatan jeet ko "islam kii jeet kaa sanket" bataaya
 Ali also defeated many other Mecca soldiers in the war
 muslim paramparaon ke mutabik ali yuddh main bees pachchis dushmano ke bich maare gaye, zyaadaatar saatvin ke saath sahamat hai; jabaki anya sabhi musalamaanon ne sanyukt rup se ek or saatvin kii hatya kar di
 Ali was prominent in the Battle of Uhud, as well as many other battles where he wielded a split sword known as Zulfikar
 mohammad kii raksha karne kii unki vishesh bhoomika thi jab adhikansh muslim sena uhood kii ladaai se bhaag gai thi or kaha gaya tha "ali ko chhodkar koi bahadur yuva nahin he or koi talwaar nahin he jo julfikar ko chhodkar seva pradaan karti he
 "he was the commander of the Muslim army in the Battle of Khabar
 is yuddh ke baad mohammad ne ali ko asadulla naam diya, jiskaa arth he "bhagwaan kaa sher"
 Ali also defended Muhammad at the Battle of Hunain in 630
 mohammad ne 'ali ko un shastriyon main se ek ke rup main namit kiya jo quran ke paath ko likhenge, jo pichley do dashakon ke dauraan mohammad ko bataaya gaya tha
 As Islam began to spread throughout Arabia, Ali helped establish the new Islamic order
 unhen 628 main mohammad or kuraishi ke bich shanti sandhi hoodabiyyah kii sandhi likhane kaa nirdesh diya gaya tha
 Ali was so reliable and reliable that Muhammad asked him to carry the message and declare the order
 630 main, ali ne makka main tirthayatriyon kii ek badi sabha main sunaaya ki quran kaa ek hissaa jisane mohammad or islamic samudaay ko arab bahuvishvaasiyon ke saath pehle kiye gaye samjhaute se bandhe nahin the
 During the conquest of Mecca in 630, Muhammad asked Ali to guarantee that the victory would be bloody
 unhone ali ko purv islamic yug ke bahuwaad se apni ashuddhta ke baad banu aus, banu khajaraj, taiy or kaaba ke logon dwaara puja kii jane vaali sabhi murtiyon ko todane kaa aadesh diya
 Ali was sent to Yemen a year later to spread the teachings of Islam
 un par kai vivaadon ko sulajhane or vibhinn janajatiyon ke vidroh ko dur karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 See also: According to the Ahl al-baithadis collection, in 631, an Arab Christian envoy from Najran came to Muhammad and argued what both sides had done in their doctrine about Jesus
 aadam kii sristi ke liye yishu ke chamatkaari janm kii tulana karne ke baad, mohammad ne unhen mubahaalaa kaha, jahaan prayek party ko apane jaankaar purush, mahilaayein or bachche laae, or jhooth bolne vaali party or unke anuyaayiyon ko shaap dene ke liye allaah se puuchhen

 Allameh Tabatatei states in Tafsir al-mizan that the word "our own" in this verse refers to Muhammad and Ali
 phir unhone varnan kiya ki imam ali al-rida, aathvin shiya imam, al-mamun, abbasid khalif ke saath charchaa main, muslim samudaay ke baaki hisson main mohammad ke vansh kii shreshthata sabit karne ke liye is kavita kaa ullekh karte hai, or ise saboot mana jaataa he ali ke mohammad ke rup main ali banane ke kaaran ali ke adhikaar ke liye khalipha ke adhikaar ke liye
 As Muhammad was returning from his last pilgrimage in 632, he made statements about Ali which have been interpreted very differently by Sunnis and Shias
 unhone gadir khum main kaaravaan ruk gai, sampradayik prarthana ke liye lautne vaale tirthayatriyon ko ikattha kiya or unhen sambodhit karnaa shuru kar diya
 According to the Encyclopedia of Islam: shiya in mukhyalayon ko mohammad ke uttaradhikari or pehle imam ke rup main ali ke padnaam ke rup main maanate hai; iske vipareet, sunni unhen keval mohammad or ali ke bich ghanishtha aadhyatmik sambandhon kii abhivyakti ke rup main lete hai, or unki ichha ke anusaar ali, unke chachere bhai or damaad ke rup main, unki mrityu par unki paariwarik jimmedaariyon kaa uttaradhikari he, lekin jaruri nahin ki unka pad raajnneetik adhikaar kai sufi is prakaran ko ali ke liye mohammad kii aadhyatmik shakti or adhikaar ke hastantaran ke rup main bhi samajhate hai, jinhen ve vaili sam utkrushtataa ke rup main maanate hai
 Both Shia and Sunni sources indicate that, after the sermon, Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman pledged allegiance to Ali
 mohammad ke uttaradhikaar yah bhi dekhen: quran kii utpatti or vikaas, mohammad, sakfah, rashidun or pad ke haddees ke uttaradhikarmuhammad kii mrityu ke baad 632 main ali ke jivan kaa ek or hissaa shuru hua or 656 main teesraa khalipha 'uthman ebn' afaan kii hatya tak chali gai
 During those 24 years, Ali neither participated in any war or victory, nor did he hold any executive position
 unhone raajnneetik maamalon se waapas le liya, khaastaur par apni patni fatima jehar kii mrityu ke baad
 He used his time to serve his family and work as a farmer
 ali ne bahut saare kuen khole or madina ke paas bageeche lagaae or unhen saarvajanik upyog ke liye sampann kiya
 These wells are known today as Abar Ali
 ali ne mohammad kii mrityu ke chah maheene baad quran, musaaf, kaa ek purna sanskaran sankalit kiya
 The volume was completed and performed by a camel to show others from Medina
 is mushaf kaa aadesh us samay se bhinn tha jo baad main uthamanik yug ke dauraan ikattha kiya gaya tha
 This book was rejected by many when he showed it to them
 iske baavjood, ali ne manakikrut mus'haf ke khilaaf koi pratirodh nahin kiya
 After uniting the Arab tribes into a Muslim religious polity in the last years of his life, Muhammad's death in 632 led to disagreements over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community
 jabaki ali or baaki mohammad ke kareebi parivaar apane sharir ko dafnane ke liye dho rahe the, jabaki sakifa main muslimon ke ek chote samooh ne bhaag liya, ek mohammad ke kareebi saathi abu bakar ko samudaay ke netritv ke liye namit kiya gaya tha
 Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph
 abu bakar kii pasand mohammad ke kuch saathi ne vivaadit kii thi, jinhone kaha tha ki ali ko mohammad ne apane uttaradhikari ko namit kiya tha
 Later when Fatimah and Ali sought assistance from the Sahyagis in the matter of the authority of the Caliph, they replied, 'O daughter of the Messenger of God! We have given our allegiance to Abu Bakr
 agar ali isse pehle hamaare paas aae the, to ham nishchit rup se use tyaag nahin paaenge
 Ali said, 'was it appropriate that we should quarrel with the Caliph before the Prophet was buried?' khilaafat ke chunaav ke baad, abu bakar or umr kuch anya saathi ke saath fatima ke ghar gaye or ali or unke samarthakon ko majaboor karne ke liye majaboor kiya jo abu bakar ko apana nishtha dene ke liye ikatthe hue the
 Then, it is alleged that Umar threatened to fire until they came out and swore allegiance to Abu Bakr
 apane pati ke samarthan main fatima ne ek pralobhan shuru kar diya or "apane baalo ko ujagar karne" kii dhamkee di, jis par abu bakar ne pashchaatap kiya or waapas le liya
 Ali has repeatedly said that he had forty men with him, he must have protested
 ali ne sakriy rup se apana adhikaar nahin lagaaya kyonki vah navjaat muslim samudaay ko sangharsh main phenkna nahin chahta tha
 Other sources say that Ali accepted Omar's selection as Khalifa and even gave his daughters Um Kulathum in marriage
 is vivaadaaspad mudde ne musalamaanon ko baad main do samoohon, sunni or shiya main vibhajit kar diya
 Sunnis insisted that Muhammad never appointed a successor, yet Abu Bakr was elected the first caliph by the Muslim community
 sunni mohammad ke sahi uttaradhikari ke rup main pehle chaar khalifon ko pahachaanate hai
 The Shias believe that Muhammad explicitly named Ali as his successor in the Ghadir Khumm and that the Muslim leadership belonged to him as determined by divine command
 wilferd madelang ke mutabik, ali swayan mohammad, unke ghanishtha sambandh or islam ke bare main unke gyaan or unke gunon kii seva main unki yogyata ke saath apane kareebi sambandh ke aadhaar par khalipha ke liye apni vaidhata se aashwast the
 He told Abu Bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance as a caliph was based on his conception of his earlier title
 ali ne aakhirkaar abu bakar or phir umr or uthman ke prati nishtha kaa vachan diya, lekin islam kii ekta ke liye aisa kiya tha, jab ek baar jab yah spasht ho gaya ki musalmaan usase dur ho gaye the
 Ali also believed that he could fulfill his role of Imamate without this fight
 abu bakar ke khaliphot kii shuruyaat main, mohammad kii beti, vishesh rup se fadak, fatimah or ali ke bich ek taraf or duusari taraf abu bakar ke bich ek vivaad tha
 Fatima asked Abu Bakr to change his property, the land of Fadak and Khaybar
 lekin abu bakar ne inkaar kar diya or unase kaha ki bhavishyavaktaaon ke paas koi viraasat nahin he or fadak muslim samudaay se sambandhit tha
 Abu Bakr said to him, "the Apostle of Allah said, We have no successors, everything we leave is Sadaka
 " umm ayman ke saath milakar, ali ne is tathy kii gavaahi di ki mohammad ne ise fatima jehar ko diya, jab abu bakar ne unase apane daawey ke liye gavaahon ko bulaava dene kaa anurodh kiya
 Fatima became angry and stopped talking to Abu Bakr, and he kept following the attitude until she died
 'aisha ne yah bhi kaha ki "jab allaah ke preshit kii mrityu ho gai, to unki patniyon ne uthman ko abu bakar ko bhejne ke liye kaha ki vah viraasat ke apane hisse ke liye kahen
 "then 'aisha said to them," Did not the Apostle of Allah say,' Our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave must be spent in charity? " kuch sutron ke mutabik, ali ne varsh 633 main apni patni fatima kii mrityu ke kuch samay baad abu bakar ko nishtha kii shapath nahin di thi
 'ali attended Abu Bakr's funeral
 unhone duusare khalipha umr ebn khattab ke prati nishtha kaa vachan diya or unhen ek vishwasaneey salaahkaar ke rup main madad kii
 Omar relied exclusively on Ali as the Chief Justice of Medina
 unhone umr ko islamic calendar kii shuruyaat ke rup main hijra set karne kii salaah di
 Omar used Ali's suggestions in political issues as well as religious ones
 'ali umr dwaara niyukt teesri khalipha chunane ke liye chunavi parishad main se ek tha
 Although 'ali was one of the two leading candidates, the council's system was against him
 saad ebn abi vakkaas or abdur rahamaan bin Awf, jo chachere bhai the, swaabhaavik rup se uthman kaa samarthan karne ke icchhuk the, jo abdur rahamaan ke damaad the
 In addition, Umar voted casting Abdur Rahman
 abdur rahamaan ne is shart par ali ko khalipha kii peshkash kii ki use quran ke anusaar shashan karnaa chahie, mohammad dwaara nirdhaarit udhaaharan, or pehle do khalipha dwaara sthapit udhaaharan
 Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it
 ilon abi al-hadeed kii tippaniyon ke anusaar ilokence ali ke shikhar par unki pratishtha par jor diya gaya, lekin adhikansh matadaataaon ne uthman or ali ko samarthan dene ke liye anicchhuk rup se aagrah kiya
 'uthman ibn' Afan expressed leniency towards his relative Banu abd-shams, who seemed to dominate him, and his arrogant mistreatment towards many early companions such as Abu Dhar al-ghafari, abd-allah ibn Mas'ud and Amar ibn
 Yasir provoked outrage among some groups of people
 adhikansh samrajya main 650-651 ke baad se asantosh or pratirodh khuleam ubhara
 Dissatisfaction with his rule and the governments he appointed was not limited to provinces outside of Arabia
 jab uthman ke rishtedaar, vishesh rup se maaravaan ne us par niyantran praapt kiya, to mahaan parishad, jisamen matadaata parishad ke adhikansh sadsy shaamil the, unke khilaaf ho gaye yaa kam se kam apana samarthan waapas le liya, khalipha par dabaav daalane or apane tareekon ko kam karne ke dabaav daalane apane drudh sambandh kaa prabhaav
 At this time, Ali acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him
 kai avasaron par ali ne udhman ke saath hudud ke aavedan main asahmat; unhone saarvajanik rup se abu dhrar al-ghifaari ke liye sahanubhuti dikhaayi thi or ammar ebn yasir kii raksha main dridhtaa se baat kii thi
 He told Uthman about criticisms of other allies and acted as negotiator on behalf of Uthman with provincial opponents who had come to Medina; This seems to have caused some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family
 aakhirkaar, unhone gheraabandi kii gambhirtha ko apane aagrah se kam karne kii koshish kii ki uthman ko pani kii anumati di jaani chahie
 There is a dispute among historians about the relationship between Ali and Uthman
 haalanki uthman ke prati nishtha kii pratigya karte hue, ali apni kuch nitiyon se asahmat the
 In particular, he clashed with Uthman over the question of religious law
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki ubaayad allaah ebn umr or walid ebn ukba jaise kai maamalon main dharmik sajaa kii jaani chahie
 In 650 during the pilgrimage, he faced Uthman with disdain for the change of prayer ritual
 jab uthman ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah jo kuch bhi use fees se le legaa, to ali ne kaha ki us maamle main khalipha ko majaboor kar diya jayega
 Ali attempted to protect mates from motherhood by a caliph like Ibn Masood
 isliye, kuch itihaaskaar ali ko uthman ke vipaksh ke pramukh sadasyon main se ek maanate hai, yadi mukhya nahin he
 But his decision was rejected due to the fact that Wilferd Madelungis did not have the support of Qureshi to be elected as Khalifa
 unke anusaar, is baat kaa koi saboot nahin he ki ali ke vidrohiyon ke saath ghanishtha sambandh the jinhone apane khalipha kaa samarthan kiya yaa unke kaaryon ko nirdeshit kiya
 Some other sources say that Ali acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him
 haalanki, madelang ne maaravaan ko bataaya ki ali ke pote jain al-abidin ne kaha tha ki Someone was more temperate than your mentor than yours
 muslim itihaas main sabase kathin avadhi main se ek ke dauraan, ali 656 or 661 ke bich khalipha tha, jo ki pehle fitnh ke saath bhi hua tha
 Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polar communal historiography, biographical material is often biased
 lekin sutara is baat se sahamat hai ki vah ek gahan dharmik vyakti tha, jo islam ke kaaran or quran or sunnat ke anusaar nyaay kaa shashan tha; vah dharmik kartavyon ke maamle main musalamaanon ke khilaaf yuddh main lage the
 Sources mention in the notice on their austerity, rigorous observance of religious duties, and separation from worldly goods
 is prakaar kuch lekhakon ne bataaya he ki unhen raajnneetik kaushal or lacheelaapan kii kami he
 Uthman's assassination meant that the rebels had to choose a new caliphate
 yah kathinaaiyon se mulaakaat kii kyonki vidrohiyon ko muhjirun, ansaar, misravasi, kufaan or basrite samet kai samoohon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha 
 There were three candidates: Ali, Talhah and al-zubair
 sabase pehle vidrohiyon ne ali se sampark kiya, chauthe khalif hone ke liye unhen anurodh karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept office, but he turned down the offer, suggesting to be a consultant rather than a chief
 talha, jubayre or anya saathi ne khalipha ke vidrohiyon ke prastaav se inkaar kar diya
 Therefore, the rebels warned the residents of Medina to elect a caliphate within a day, or they would implement drastic action
 dedlock ko hal karne ke liye, muslim al-masjid en- naabavi main 18 june, 656 ko khalipha niyukt karne ke liye ekatra hue 
 Initially, 'ali refused to accept it, as only his most powerful supporters were rebels
 haalanki, jab madina ke nivaasiyon ke alaava mohammad ke kuch ullekhneey saathi ne unhen prastaav sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya, to vah antat sahamat hue
 According to Abu Mekhnaf's narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'ali, but other legends claimed otherwise that he was forced to give his vows
 iske alaava, talhah or ez-jubayre ne baad main daawa kiya ki unhone unhen anichhaa se samarthan diya he
 Regardless, Ali rejected these claims, insisting that they recognized them as sloppy
 wilferd madelang kaa maananaa he ki bal ne logon se pratigya dene kaa aagrah nahin kiya or unhone masjid main saarvajanik rup se vachan diya
 While many of the rebels, along with the population of Medina, gave their vows, some important figures or tribes did not
 uthman ke rishtedaar umayyaad levent main bhaag gaye, yaa apane gharon main bane rahe, baad main 'ali kii vaidhata' se inkaar kar diya
 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas was absent and 'abdullah ibn' Umar stopped offering his allegiance, but the two assured 'ali that they would not act against him
 is prakaar ali ne rashidun khaliphot ko viraasat main mila - jo pashchim main misr se purv main irani pahadiyon tak failaa tha- jabaki hejaj or anya praanton kii sthiti main unke chunaav kii purv sandhya par sthiti pareshaan nahin thi
 Soon after becoming Ali Khalifa, he rejected the provincial governors whom Uthman had appointed, replacing them with trusted allies
 unhone mugira ebn shuba or ebn abbaas ke vakil ke khilaaf kaam kiya, jinhone unhen saavdhaanee se apane shashan ke saath aage badhane kii salaah di thi
 Madelung states that Ali was deeply convinced of his authority and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for political expediency, and to fight against overwhelming odds
 uthman ke sansthaapak muvayah pratham or levent ke governor ne ali ke adeshon ko prastut karne se inkaar kar diya; vah aisa karne vaala ekmaatr rajyapal tha
 Ali's name with Islamic calligraphy in Hagia Sophia, when he was appointed Caliph, told the citizens of Medina that Muslim politics had suffered from dissent and controversy; He wanted to purify Islam of any evil
 unhone jansankhya ko sachche muslimon ke rup main vyavhaar karne kii salaah di, chetavanee di ki vah koi rajdroh bardaasht nahin karegaa or jo log vidhvansak gatividhiyon ke doshi paae gaye hai unhen kathor tareeke se niptaya jayega
 Aisha, Talha, al-zubair and the Umayyads, especially Mu'awiyah e and Marvan I, wanted to punish the rioters who had killed 'ali Uthman
 unhone basra ke kareeb deraa daalaa
 The talks lasted for several days and were later sparked by protests during the heated exchange and parley, leading to loss of life on both sides
 bhram main oont kii ladaai 656 main shuru hui, jahaan ali vijayi ho gaya
 Some historians believe that he used the issue to find his political ambitions because he found Ali's caliphate against his advantage
 vidrohiyon ne kaha ki quran or sunnat ke anusaar shashan nahin karne ke liye uthman ko maar daalaa gaya tha, isliye koi pratishodh nahin kiya janaa tha
 Some say that the Khalifa was the gift of the rebels and that Ali did not have enough force to control or punish them, while others say that Ali accepted the rebels' argument or at least did not consider Uthman a ruler
 Ruler
 aisi paristhitiyon main, ek vivaad hua jisane muslim itihaas main pehla grih yuddh shuru kiya
 Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman to be a rightful and just caliph until the end, who was killed illegally
 kuch anya, jinhen ali kii party ke naam se janaa jaataa he, kaa maananaa tha ki uthman galati main gir gaya tha, unhone khalipha ko jabt kar liya tha or kanoonee tareeke se apane tareeke se sudhaarney yaa kadam uthaane ke inkaar karne ke liye kanoon main nishpadit kiya tha; is prakaar ali sirf sahi or sachche imam the or unke virodhiyon main naastik
 This was not Ali's position himself
 is grih yuddh ne muslim samudaay ke bheetar sthaayee vibhaajan banaae, jinke paas khalipha par kabja karne kaa vaid adhikaar tha
 The First Fitna, 656–661, continued after Uthman's assassination, during Ali's caliphate, and was abolished by the Caliph's notion of Mu'awiya
 is grih yuddh islamic ummeh kii praarambhik ekta ke ant ke rup main khed he
 Ali appointed 'abd Allah ibn al-abbas, the governor of Basra and moved his capital to the Muslim garrison city of Kufa in Iraq
 baad roman-farsi yudhon or bijantin saasaani yuddh ki saikadon varshon se chali, vahaan iraq ke bich gahari jaden matbhed, aupchaarik rup se farsi main the sassanid samrajya or syria aupchaarik rup se ke tahat bijantin samrajya
 The Iraqis wanted the newly established Islamic State capital to be in Kufa so that they could bring in revenue to their territory and oppose Syria
 unhone ali ko kupha main aane or iraq main kupha main rajdhani sthapit karne ke liye aashwast kiya
 Later Muawiyah I, the governor of the Levant and cousin of Uthman, refused Ali's demands for loyalty
 ali ne apane nishtha ko waapas paane kii ummiido ko kholaa, lekin muvayah ne apane shashan ke tahat levent swaittata par jor diya
 Muawiyah refused to pay tribute to Ali by mobilizing his Levantine supporters and saying that his party did not participate in his election
 ali ne apni senaaon ko uttar main sthanantarit kar diya or donon senaayen ek sau se adhik dinon tak cyphin main khud ko deraa daale, zyaadaatar samay baatcheet main bitaai gai
 Although Ali exchanged several letters with Mu'awiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuaded him to pledge allegiance
 partiyon ke bich takaraav ne 657 main cyphin kii ladaai kaa netritv kiya
 After a violent battle known as Lalit al-harir after a week of fighting, Mu'awiyah's army was on the point of passage when Amr ibn al-aas advised Mu'awiyah to pounce his troops
 
 ali ne stratage ke madhyam se dekha, lekin keval ek alpsankhyak ladaai kaa peechha karnaa chahta tha
 Eventually the two armies agreed to settle who should be the caliph through mediation
 ladane ke liye ali kii sena main sabase bada block kaa inkaar karnaa madhyasthata kii sweekruti main nirnaayak kaarak tha
 The question is whether the arbitrator will represent Ali or Kufan, with further division in Ali's army
 ashath ebn kyuu or kuch anya ne ali ke ummidavaaron ko 'abd allaah ebn' abbaas or malik al- ashtar ko khaarij kar diya, or abu musa ashaari par apni tatasthta ke liye jor diya
 Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa
 amrit ebn al- e ko muvayah ne madhyasth ke rup main niyukt kiya tha
 Seven months later the two mediators met in Jordan 658, 10 miles northwest of Mann, in Jordan
 amrit ebn al- abu musa ashaari ne aashwast kiya ki ali or muvayah donon ko kadam uthaanaa chahie or ek nayaa khalipha chune jane chahie
 Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision, which reduced the caliphate to the status of rebel Mu'awiyah
 isliye ali ko muvayah or amrit ebn al-es ne bulaayaa tha
 When the arbitrators gathered at daumit-ul-jandal, a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss matters
 jab khalipha ke bare main nirnay lene ke liye samay aayaa, amrit bin al-aas ne abu musa al-ashaari ko is baat kaa manoranjan karne main vishwaas dilaayaa ki unhen khalipha ke ali or muvaaya donon ko vanchit karnaa chahie, or musalamaanon ko chunaav karne kaa adhikaar dena chahie khalipha abu musa al-ashaari ne tadnusaar kaary karne kaa bhi faisla kiya
 According to Punawala, it appears that the arbitrators and other eminent persons met in January 659 to discuss the selection of the new Caliph, with the exclusion of the arbitrators
 amrit ne muvayah kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki abu musa ne apane damaad abdulla ebn umr ko pasand kiya, lekin baad vaale ne sarvasammati se chunaav ke liye khadey hone se inkaar kar diya
 Abu Musa proposed, and Amrit agreed, to leave both Ali and Mu'awiyah and submit a selection of the new Caliph to Shura
 abu musa ke baad saarvajanik ghoshnaa main samjhaute ke apane hisse ko dekha gaya, lekin amrit ne ali ko ghoshit kar diya or muvaaya ko khalipha ke rup main pushti kii
 Ali refused to accept his decision and found it technically in breach of his pledge to hold elections and to follow arbitration
 'ali ne virodh kiya, yah bataate hue ki yah quran or sunnat ke vipareet taur isliye badhyakaari nahin tha
 He then tried to organize a new army, but the Qasr's remnant Ansar, led by Malik Ashtar, and some of his clans remained loyal
 isane ali ko apane samarthakon ke bich bhi ek kamjor sthiti main daal diya
 Mediation resulted in the disintegration of 'ali's alliance, and some have stated that this was Muawiyah's intention
 ali ke shivi main sabase mukhar virodhiyon ne vahi log the jinhone ali ko yudhviram main majaboor kar diya tha
 He broke through Ali's force, rallying under resentment "mediation belongs to God alone
 " is samooh ko kharijiyon ke rup main janaa jane laga
 He considered everyone his enemy
 65 9 main ali kii sena or kharijiyon ne naharvan kii ladaai main mulaakaat kii
 The Qurra then came to be known as Kharijites
 tab kharijiyon ne ali ke samarthakon or anya muslimon kii hatya shuru kar di
 He considered someone who was not part of his group as an unbeliever
 haalanki 'ali ne ek bade antar se ladaai jiti, phir bhi nirantar sangharsh unki sthiti ko prabhavit karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 While dealing with the Iraqis, Ali found it difficult to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions
 unhone kharijiyon se ladane main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 As a result, 'ali found it difficult to expand the kingdom on its eastern front
 lagbhag usee samay, misr main ashaanti paidaa ho rahi thi
 The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali replaced him with Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
 muvayah ne misr ko jeetne ke liye 'amrit ebn al' kii anumati di or amrit ne safaltaapurvak aisa kiya
 Amrit first took Egypt eighteen years before the Romans but was dismissed by Uthman
 mohammad ebn abi bakar ke paas misr main koi lokapriy samarthan nahin tha or 2000 purushon ke saath milakar kaamyaab rahe lekin ve bina ladaai ke fail gaye
 In the following years, Mu'awiyah's army captured many cities in Iraq, which Ali's governors could not stop, and the people did not support him to fight with them
 muvayah ne misr, hijaaj, yaman or anya kshetron ko parajeet kiya
 In the last year of Ali's caliphate, the mood in Kufa and Basra changed in their favor as people became confused with Mu'awiyah's reign and policies
 haalanki, ali ke prati logon kaa ravaiya gaharaai se bhinn tha
 Only a small minority of them believed that Ali was the best Muslim after Muhammad and was only entitled to rule over them, while the majority supported him because of his mistrust and opposition to Mu'awiyah
 kaha jaataa he ki ali ne uthman kii maut ke baad khalipha main safal hone ke liye janata dwaara dabaae jane ke baad khalipha ke rankon main vittiya bhrashtachar or anuchit visheshadhikaron ke khilaaf ek asangat abhiyaan kii shapath lee or aagaah kiya
 The Shias argue that despite their unpopularity with the elite, their determination to push these reforms has been a cause of enmity from the rich and privileged former companions of the Prophet
 apane governor malik ashtar ko ek prasiddh patr main, unhone apane samarthak garib virdohi virdohi drushtikon ko vyakt kiya: Remember that dislike and disapproval of ordinary men, acceptance of important persons and resentment of some of the larger ones do not bother more people than imbalances, if the general public and public relations of your subject are happy with you

 The regular public curse of Imam Ali in congregational prayers remained an important institution that was not abolished after 60 years by Omar ibn Abd al-aziz

 According to the fake Umayyad Islam claims legitimate sovereignty in Islam as a sub-rule of God, and in the context of Umayyad betrayal, arbitrary and divisive government and vindictive vengeance, they came to appreciate his honesty, his unbearable devotion
 The rule of Islam, his deep personal loyalty, the equal treatment of all his supporters, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies

 Ali is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority
 dharamshastra or exegesis se sulekh or ank vigyaan se vishyon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa, kanoon or rahasyavaad se arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti se ali dwaara pehali baar mana jaataa he
 According to a hadith described by the Shia and Sufis, Muhammad told of them, "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate 


" Muslims consider Ali a major authority in Islam
 shiya ke mutabik, ali ne khud hi yah gavaahi di: There was not a single verse of the Quran but was revealed, which he did not proceed to direct me and read to me
 main ise apane haath se likhuunga, or vah mujhe apane tafaseer or tavil, nasikh ke rup main nirdeshit karegaa or manasmukh, muhakkam or matashabih, vishesh or saamaanya 


 According to Seyed Hossein Nasser, Ali is credited with establishing Islamic theology and his citations include the first rational evidence of the unity of God among Muslims
 ebn abi al-hadeed ne uddhrut kiya he For the sake of doctrine and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art
 is tarah ke kuch bhi unke vishisht aankadon yaa nichle rankon main se kuch ke bich prasaarit nahin kiya gaya tha
 The art was the exclusive preserve of Greece, whose sage was the only extender
 arabon ke bich sauda karne vaala pehla vyakti ali tha
 In later Islamic philosophies, especially in the teachings of Mulla Sadra and his followers, like Alemeh Tabatatei, Ali's stories and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of spiritual knowledge, or divine philosophy
 sadara ke skool ke sadsy ali ko islam ke sarvocch aadhyatmik chikitsak maanate hai
 According to Henry Corbin, Nahj al-balagha can be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines made by Shiite thinkers, especially after 1500
 iskaa prabhaav shabdon ke taarkik samanvay, katautee main mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he sahi nishkarshon ke, or arabi main kuch takneekee sharton kaa nirmaan jo saahitiyik or darshanik bhashaa main swatantra rup se unani granthon ke arabi main anuwaad ke pravesh main pravesh kiya
 In addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as Jafar, Islamic numerology, and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, have been established by Ali, through which he al-jafar and al-jamia
 ali arabi sahitya kaa ek mahaan vidwaan bhi tha or arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti ke kshetra main agrani tha
 Many of Ali's short stories have become part of the general Islamic culture and are cited in daily life as excitement and stories
 ve saahitiyik kaaryon kaa aadhaar bhi ban gaye hai yaa kai bhashaaon main kavy kavita main ekikrut kiye gaye hai
 In the 8th century, literary authorities such as' Abd al-hamid ibn Yahya al-amiri pointed to Ali's unique pronunciation of sermons and stories, as did al-jahiz in the following century
 umayyaad ke divaan ke karmchaariyon ne bhi apane vakprachaar ko sudhaarney ke liye ali ke upadeshon ko padhaa
 The most famous selection of Ali's words and writings is gathered by a 10th-century Shia scholar, al-sharif al-radi, in a book called Nahj al-balgha, who selected him for his singular rhetorical beauty
 pustak main uddhrut upadeshon ke bich note, andekha upadesh ke saath hi alef ke upadesh bhi he
 According to the legends, some of Muhammad's companions were discussing the role of letters in speaking
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki bolne main alef kaa sabase bada yogadan tha or bindidaar patr bhi mahatvapurn the
 Meanwhile, Ali read two long impromptu sermons, one according to shell writer Langroudy, without using the letter Aleph and the other without dotted letters, without deep and eloquent concepts
 ek isai lekhak jorge Jordac, ne kaha ki Aleph or dot ke bina upadesh saahitiyik kriti ke rup main mana janaa tha
 Ali is respected for his deep sympathy and support for the poor and orphans, and he pursued similar egalitarian policies during his caliphate with the aim of achieving social justice
 unhen yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he: If God grants wealth and prosperity to any person, then he should show kindness to his worthy kith and kin, provide for the poor, help those who are suffering from disasters, misfortune and the reverse, help the poor And honest people should help in ending their debt


 yah kitaab al- kaaphi main sunai gai he ki amir al-muminine ali ebn abi talib ko baghdad ke paas sthanon se shahad or anjir ke saath prastut kiya gaya tha
 Upon receiving the gift, he ordered his officers to bring the orphans so that they could lick the honey from the containers while he rested himself among the people
 nahaj al-balgha main ali ke liye jimmedaar bolne vaale upadesh, patr or uddhran shaamil hai jinhen raakh-sharif aar-radio dwaara sankalit kiya gaya he
 Reza Shah Kazemi states: "despite ongoing questions about the authenticity of the text, recent scholarship suggests that much of the material in it may actually be attributed to Ali" and in support of an article by Mokhtar Jebali Gives reference
 arabi sahitya main is pustak kii ek pramukh sthiti he
 It is also considered an important intellectual, political and religious work in Islam

 Masadir Nahj al-balagha wa Asanidah, written by al-sayyid ‘abd al-zahra’ al-husayn al-khatib, offers some of these sources
 iske alaava, mohammad baqir al- mahamudi dwaara nahaj al-saadah faai mastadra nahaj al-balaghah ali ke maujuuda bhaashanon, upadeshon, niyamon, patron, prarthanaaon or ekatrit hone vaale kahaniyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he

 Ali's descendants are known as Sharifs, stories or stories by Fatima
 ye arabi main aadarneey khitaab hai, sharif kaa arth 'mahaan' he or kaha jaataa he yaa kaha jaataa he yaa 'bhagwaan' yaa 'sar' kahata he
 As the only descendants of Muhammad, he is respected by both Sunni and Shia
 mohammad ke alaava, islamic itihaas main koi bhi nahin he jiske bare main islamic bhashaaon main ali ke rup main likhaa gaya he
 In Muslim culture, Ali is honored for his courage, wisdom, faith, honesty, devotion to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving defeated enemies, and therefore of mystical traditions The center is like Sufism in Islam
 ali kuranik exegesis, islamic nyaayashasre or dharmik vichaar par ek adhikaar ke rup main apane kad barkaraar rakhata he
 Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders that trace his lineage to Muhammad through them
 puure islamic itihaas main ali kaa prabhaav mahatvapurn rahaa he
 Sunni and Shia scholars agree that the verse of Wilayah was recited in honor of Ali, but Wilayah and Imamate have different interpretations
 sunni vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki kavita ali ke bare main he, lekin unhen shiya muslim vichaar main, imam ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa jaataa he, ali ko bhagwaan dwaara mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 There are several verses interpreted by Shia scholars referring to Ali or other Shia Imams
 is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue ki quran main imam ke naamon kaa ullekh kyon nahin kiya gaya he, mohammad al-baqir uttar dete hai: "allaah ne apane paigambar ko salaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin teen yaa chaar rakaton ke bare main kabhi nahin kaha, jakaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin iske vivaranon kaa zikr nahin kiya haj lekin iske tawaaf or paigambar kii ginati nahin hui thi 
 He revealed this verse and the Prophet said that this verse is about Ali, Hasan, Hussain and the twelve Imams
 " ali ke anusaar kuranik chhandon kii ek chauthai imam ke stesan ko bataa rahi he
 Mammen lists many of these verses in his introduction to Shia Islam
 haalanki, kuch chand hai ki kuch sunni tippaneekar ali ke sandarbh main vyakhya karte hai, jinamein se vilaah kii kavita he ki sunni or shiya vidwaan is ghatana ko sanderbhit karte hai ali ne apni anguthi ko ek bhikhaari ko diya jisane masjid main anushthan prarthana karte hue bhakton se poocha
 Mavadda's poem is one of the verses, both Sunni and Shiite associated Ali's name with some other names
 mubahaalaa kii uparokt kavita, or yah bhi pad 2: 26 9 jisamen ali ko shiya or sunni donon tippaneekaron dwaara adwitiya gyaan ke saath sammanit kiya jaataa he is tarah ke chand
 The Shia consider Ali the most important person after Muhammad and he represents a complex, mythological figure in his memory
 vah gunon kaa ek paragon he, jaise saahas, mahanata, eemaandaaree, sidhaapan, vakprachaar or gahan gyaan
 Ali was righteous but faced injustice, he was authoritative but kind and courteous, vigorous but also patient, learned but also a laboring man
 shiya ke anusaar, mohammad ne apane jeevankaal ke dauraan vibhinn avasaron par suzav diya ki unki mrityu ke baad ali musalamaanon kaa netaa hona chahie
 It is supported by many hadiths, narrated by Shams, including the Hadith of the pond of Khum, the Hadiths of two weighty things, the Hadiths of pen and paper, the Hadiths of the Cloak, the Hadiths of the post, the invitation of the Nimath close family, and the twelve successors The Hadith
 jafar al-sadik haddees main varnan karata he ki mohammad main jo bhi gun paaya gaya vah ali main paaya gaya tha, jo uske maargdarshan se dur hokar allaah or uske paigambar se dur ho jayega
 Ali himself describes that he is the gateway and overseer to reach Allah
 is drushtikon ke anusaar, mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main ali ne nyaay main samudaay par shashan nahin kiya, balki sharia kanoon or iske gudh arth kaa bhi arth diya 
 He was therefore considered free from error and sin, and ordained by God by divine decree through Muhammad
 yah twailvar or ismali shi islam main mana jaataa he ki 'ekl, divine gyaan, bhavishyavaktaaon or imaamon kii atmaaon kaa strot tha or unhen goom naamak gudh gyaan diya gaya tha or unke dukh unke bhakton ko divya krupa kaa saadhan the
 Although the Imam was not the recipient of a divine revelation, he had a close relationship with God through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides people
 unke shabdon or karm samudaay ke liye ek guide or model hai;natijatan yah sharia kanoon kaa strot he
 Shia pilgrims usually go to Mashad Ali in Najaf for Ziyarat, pray there and recite "ziyarat Amin Allah" or other Ziyaratnam

 gregory tithi is ke liye har saal badalata he: Main article: Sunni visions of Ali see Sunnis as the fourth caliph
 ali islam ke sabase mahaan yoddha champiyanon main se ek ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he

 Almost all Sufi orders trace their lineage to Muhammad through Ali, an exception to the Naqshbandi that went through Abu Bakr
 yahaan tak ki is aadesh main, ali ke mahaan mahaan pote jafar al-sadik hai 
 Sufis believe that Ali inherited from Muhammad the saturated Shakti Vilah that makes spiritual travel to God possible
 jaise prakhyat sufi ali huviri kaa daawa he ki parampara ali ke saath shuru hua or junaid of baaghdaad ke rup main mana ali shaikh siddhanton or sufi mat ke prathaon ke
 Sufis read Manakbat Ali in praise of Ali
 ali ko kuch paramparaon main darj kiya gaya he kyonki un logon ko manaa kar diya jinhone apane jeevankaal main unki puja karne kii maang kii thi
 Some groups like the Alawites are believing that Ali was God incarnate
 islamic vidwaanon ke bahumat se unhen gulaat ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 According to traditional Muslims, Islam has been abandoned in these groups because of the exaggeration of human admirable qualities
 main ali-illahism, ek samadharmi vishwaas kiya gaya lagaataar vahaan he par dharm kendron avatar unke ke devtaa puure itihaas main, or bhandar 'ali, mohammad kaa betaa ji ne aise hi ek avatar mana jaataa he ke liye vishesh rup se shraddha
 Druze, a syncretic religion, believes that God was a descendant of al-hakim bi-amr Allah Ali, in particular the incarnated human being
 yah bhi dekhen: praarambhik islam kii aitihaasiktaali ke jivan par chaatravrutti ke liye praathmik strot quran or ahmadi hai, saath hi praarambhik islamic itihaas ke anya granth bhi hai
 Extensive secondary sources include the writings of Sunni and Shea Muslims, Christian Arabs, Hindus, and other non-muslims from the Middle East and Asia, and in addition to some works by modern Western scholars
 haalanki, shuruaati islamic sroton main se kuch ali kii taraf sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak purvaagrah se kuch had tak rangeen hai
 Against these assertions there had previously been a common trend among Western scholars and there were reports collected in later periods due to the tendency towards Sunni and Shea biased positions; Later such scholars about him as texture
 isse unhen kuch report kiye gaye kaaryakramon ko anaupchaarik yaa apraasangik mana jaataa he
 Leon Kaitani considered Ibn Abbas and Aisha to be a feature of historical reports during the profits of accounts reported without Isnad by early compilers of history such as Ibn Issaq
 wilferd madelang ne "shuruaati sroton" main shaamil nahin hone vaali har cheez ko andhadhundh rup se khaarij karne ke rukh ko khaarij kar diya he or is drushtikon main akele pravriti ko der se utpatti ke liye koi saboot nahin he
 According to him, Kaitani's approach is inconsistent
 medalang or kuch baad ke itihaaskaar baad kii avadhi main sankalit kiye gaye kathaon ko asweekaar nahin karte hai or itihaas ke sandarbh main or ghatnaon or aankadon ke saath unki sangatta ke aadhaar par unka nyaay karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Until the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate, few books were written and most reports were oral

 When the paper was introduced to Muslim society, several monographs were written between 750 and 950
 robinsan ke anusaar, kam se kam bees ek alag monograph cyphin kii ladaai par banaaye gayi hai
 Abi Mikhnaf is one of the best-known authors of the period who tried to collect all the reports
 9veen or 10 veen shatabdi ke itihaaskaaron ne ekatrit, chaynit kathaon kaa chayan or vyavastha kii
 However, most of these monographs have not been used except by a few works by Muhammad ibn Jarir al-tabari, such as the History of the Prophets and Kings
 iraq ke shiya ne monograph likhane main sakriy rup se bhaag liya lekin unamem se adhikansh kaam kho gaye hai
 On the other hand, the descendants of Ali in the 8th and 9th centuries describe their citations and reports as Sadiq, such as Muhammad al-baqir and Jafar, which are collected in the Shia Hadith books
 10 veen shatabdi ke baad likhaa gaya shiya kaam karata he jo chaudaa infalibles or baarah imam kii jeevani ke bare main he
 One of the oldest surviving works and most important works in the region is Kitab al-irshad by Shaykh Mufid
 lekhak ne ali ke vistrut khate main apni pustak kaa pehla bhaag samarpit kiya he
 There are also some books called Mankib that describe Ali's character from a religious point of view
 is tarah ke kaam bhi ek tarah kii itihaslekhan kaa gathan karte hai
 Bhagirath Manjhi was the son of Tilaka Manjhi, the pioneer of movements in the Jharkhand region
 tilka maanjhi ko maanjhi vidroh ke baad faansee de di gai thi jiske baad bhagirath maanjhi ne iskaa netritv kiya
 He also led the Kherwar movement
 jain sahitya bahut vishaal he
 It is mostly religious literature
 sanskrit, praakrit or apbhransh bhashaaon main yah sahitya likhaa gaya he
 Magadha has been the center of Mahavira's tendencies, so he gave his sermon here in Ardhamagadhi, the lingua franca which is safe among the available Jain proceeds
 ye aagam 45 hai or inhen shwetambar jain pramaan maanate hai, digambar jain nahin
 According to the Dingbar, the Agama literature has been estranged from time immemorial
 digambar shatkhandgam ko sweekaar karte hai jo 12wein angadrushtiwad kaa ansh mana gaya he
 The language of ancient literature of Digambars is Shaurseni
 aage chalakar apbhransh tathaa apbhransh kii uttarkalin lok-bhashaaon main jain panditon ne apni rachanaayen likhakar bhashaa sahitya ko samrudh banaaya
 In the ancient literature, the texts of Jain literature are found in most number and most authentically
 jain rachanakaaron ne puraana kavy, charit kavy, katha kavy, raas kavy aadi vividh prakaar ke granth rache
 Swayambhu, Pushp Dant, Hemachandra, Somprabha Suri etc
 are the main Jain poets
 inhone hinduon main prachlit lok kathaon ko bhi apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or parampara se alag uski parinti apane matanukool dikhaai
 The oldest part of Jain literature is called 'agam'
 ye aagam 46 hai- The Agam Granth is quite ancient, and the place which is of Vedas in Vedic literature and of Tripitaka in Buddhist literature, the same place is of Agamas in Jain literature
 aagam granthon main mahavir ke upadeshon tathaa jain samskruti se sambandh rakhane vaali anek katha-kahaniyon kaa sankalan he
 According to Jain tradition, after 160 years of Mahavira Nirvana, there was a great downturn in Magadha countries, due to which the Jain monks had to relocate elsewhere
 dushkaal samaapt ho jane par shraman patliputra main ekatrit hue or yahan khand-khand karke gyaarah angon kaa sankalan kiya gaya, barahawaan ang kisi ko samaran nahin tha, isliye uskaa sankalan na kiya ja sakaa
 This conference is known as 'pataliputra-vachana'
 kuch samay pashchaat jab aagam sahitya kaa phir viched hone laga to mahavir nirvana ke 827 yaa 840 varsh baad jain saadhuon ke duusare sammelan hue
 One in Mathura under the chairmanship of Aryaskandil and the other under the chairmanship of Nagarjuna Suri
 mathura ke sammelan ko 'maathuri-vaachana' kii sangya di gayi he
 Then after about 150 years, 980 or 993 years after Mahavira Nirvana, the fourth conference of sadhus was held in Vallabhi under the chairmanship of Devardhigini Apology, in which the proceeds were systematically compiled for the last time
 se 'valbhi-vaachana' ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 The present proceeds are the form of this concept 
 jain aagmon kii ukt teen sankalanaaon ke itihaas se pataa lagata he ki samay-samay par aagam sahitya ko kaaphi kshati uthaani padi, or yah sahitya apane moulik rup main surakshit nahin rah sakaa
 This seems to be the reason that this literature is very less compared to the Buddhist literature, and it was probably due to the disorder in this literature that the Digambara sect refused to accept it
 isa ke purv lagbhag chauthi shatabdi se lagaakar isvi san paanchavi shatabdi tak kii bharatvarsh kii aarthik tathaa saamaajik dasha kaa chithran karne vaala yah sahitya anek drushtiyon se mahatva kaa he
 a detailed description of the ethos of Jain monks in texts like Ayarang, Suyagand, Uttarajhayana, Daswayaliya etc
, it corresponds very much to the Buddhist Dhammapada, Suttanipat and Mahabharata, etc
, and according to the statement of scholars like Dr
 Vintranese, that shramana
 - symbolizes poetry
 bhashaa or vishay aadi kii drushti se jain aagmon kaa yah bhaag sabase pracheen maaloom hota he
 In texts like Bhagwati Kalpasutra, Owaiah, Thanang, Nirayavali, Shramana gives a detailed description of Lord Mahavira, his Chariya, his teachings and the erstwhile king, prince and his war, which reveal many of the endangered practices of Jain history
 nayadhammakaha, uwasgadasa, antgavadasa, anuttarovaviyadasa, vivagasuy aadi granthon main mahavir dwaara kahi hui anek katha-kahaniyaan tathaa unki shishy-shishyaaon kaa varnan he, jisamen jain parampara sambandhi anek baton kaa parichay miltaa he
 Many important topics related to Vaastu Shastra, music, flora, etc
 are described in the texts like Raipanesya, Jeevabhigam, Pannavana, which is not available elsewhere
 chhedsutron main saadhuon ke aahaar-vihaar tathaa praayshchit aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisaki tulana baudhon ke vinayapitak se kii sakati he
 It is told in the Vrhatkalpasutra that when Mahavira Saket was a monk in a garden called Subhumibhaga, at that time he allowed his monks and nuns to visit the monastery in the east of Saket, up to Kaushambi of Daksai, and to Kunala in the north

 As a result of these actions, Mansingh was appointed as the ruler of Bengal, Bihar, South and Kabul
 " When Akbar's general Man Singh Solapur was returning after conquering Maharashtra, Mansingh thought of meeting Pratap

 ' According to some historians, this incident also became the reason for the battle of Haldi valley

 In 1576 AD, he was set on a campaign to punish Maharana Pratapsingh

 Rana Pratap fought that huge Mughal army with a handful of soldiers

 On June 21, 1576 AD, seventeen thousand soldiers were killed in this fierce battle of one day between Pratap and the Mughal army in the Haldi valley near Gogunda

 In the words of James Todd- "in the days when Akbar was horribly ill and feared to die, Mansingh Khusro had laid a web of conspiracies to place him on the Mughal throne

 dhaularai ke baad amer, jo ek maamuli rajya samajha jaataa tha, maansingh ke samay vahi ek shaktishaalee or vistrut rajya ho gaya tha
 In the history of India, the Kachhwahs were not considered as knights, but during the time of King Bhagwan Das and Mansingh, the Kachwaha people showed their strength, might and glory from Khutan to the sea
 maansingh yon akbar kii adheenta main zarur tha, par uske saath kaam karne vaali rajput sena, badshaah kii sena se kahin adhik shaktishaalee samajhi jaati thi"
 Some other historians do not agree with this about Colonel James Tod
 His statement is that Mansingh was not the adopted son of Bhagwan Das, but he was the son of Bhagwant Das
 bhagavaandas or bhagwant das donon bhai the
 Mughal-history books reveal that on the orders of Akbar, his experienced officers Maharaja Mansingh, local subedar Qutubuddin Khan and Raja Bhagwant Das of Amer made a lot of research to capture Maharana Pratap in the forests of Gogunda and Mewar but eventually failed Akbar became very angry - even in the year 1577, both of them were 'locked up' diyodhi!

 a sign of attuned attachment to his origins and deep attachment to the present is reflected in his Deuskar name, which is made up of the sum of 'deus' and 'karun'

 Deuskar, who started his life as a journalist, was particularly interested in history, literature and politics
 unhone bangla kii adhikansh krantikari patrikaon main satat lekhan kiya
 One of Deuskar's works that most influenced the Enlightenment of the Renaissance period was the 'desher Katha' published in 1904

 The foreign exploitation of the Indian economy by William Digby, Dadabhai Naoroji and Ramesh Chandra Dutt, Sakharam Deuskar composed this historical work mainly on the same basis

 But at the Congress session of Surat in 1907, when the Congress split into a hot party and a soft party, the owner of the Hitwadi asked Deuskar to write an editorial in the Hitwadi against the Garam Dal and Tilak
 sakhaaraam tilak ke raajnneetik vichaaron se ekta anubhav karte the, isliye unhone tilak ke viruddh sampadakeey lekh likhane se manaa kar diya

 But in 1910, when the managers of the National Council of Education began to view him with a skeptical view
 aisi sthiti main sakhaaraam ne shikshak pad se bhi tyaagptr de diya
 Later, when the manager of the Hitwadi requested him to be the editor again, Deuskar accepted it

 In the last days of 1910, hurt by all these blows, Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar returned to his village Karun and started living there

 manovikar kisi vyakti ke maansik swasthya kii vah sthiti he jise kisi swasth vyakti se tulana karne par 'saamaanya' nahin kaha jaataa
 In comparison to healthy individuals, the behavior of persons with psychiatry is determined to be abnormal or misdemeanor and involves significant pain or inability
 inhen manorog, maansik rog, maansik beemaari athwa maansik vikaar bhi kehete hai
 Psychiatrists are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain and psychiatric treatment is required for their treatment
 manovigyaan main hamaare liye asaamaanya or anuchit vyavhaaron ko manovikar kaha jaataa he
 They grow slowly
 manovikaron ke bahut se kaarak hai, jinamein anuvaanshikta, kamjor vyaktitv, sahansheeltaa kaa abhaav, baalyavastha ke anubhav, tanaavpurn paristhitiyaan or inkaa saamana karne kii asamarthy sammilit hai
 The situations that a person finds difficult to solve and cope with are called 'stress factors'
 tanaav kisi vyakti par aisi aavashyaktaaon va maangon ko thope detaa he jise puraa karnaa vah ati dubhar or mushkil samajhataa he
 Persistent failure to meet these demands creates mental tension in the person
 aaj ke samay main tanaav logon ke liye bahut hi saamaanya anubhav ban chukaa he, jo ki adhisankhya daihik or manovaigyanik pratikriyaaon dwaara vyakt hota he
 The traditional definition of stress focuses on the somatic response
 hens style ne 'tanaav' shabd ko khoja or isaki paribhaasha sharir kii kisi bhi aavashyaktaa ke aadhaar par anishchit pratikriya ke rup main kii
 The definition of Hans Shale's base is somatic and gives greater importance to the actions of hormones, which are secreted by the adrenals and other glands
 style ne do prakaar ke tanaavon kii sankalpana kii- The new approach to stress focuses on the role of assessment and interpretation of the situation in relation to the adjustment resources available to the individual
 moolyankan or samaayojan kii anyonyashrith prakriyaayen vyakti ke vaataavaran evam uske anukulan ke bich sambandh nirdhaaran karti he
 Adaptation is the process by which an individual arranges the conditions and environment around him to maintain optimal levels of somatic, psychological and social interest
 tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa saamana karte samay aamtaur par vyakti samasya kendrit yaa manobhaav kendrit kootneetiyon ko apanaataa he
 a problem-focused policy uses a person's intellectual solutions to find solutions to stressful situations and often leads to an effective solution
 manobhaav kendrit niti dwaara tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa saamana karte samay vyakti bhaavnaatmak vyavhaar ko pradarshit karata he jaise chillaanaa
 Although, if a person is unable to cope with stress, then he / she tends to resist-oriented diplomacy, different behaviors can arise if these are adopted repeatedly
 pratirohak-abhivinyast vyavhaar paristhiti kaa saamana karne main samarth nahin banaate, ye keval apni kaarywahiyon ko nyaaysangat dikhaane kaa jariya maatr he
 Physical problems like fever, cough, cold etc
 These are different types of psychosis
 in virgon ke manovikaron kii suchi nunatam vyagrata se lekar gambhir manovikaron jaise manobhaajan yaa khandit maansikta tak he
 Clinical and Statistical Manual on Psychiatry) has been published by the American Psychiatric Association, which mentions a wide variety of mental disorders
 manovigyaan kii jo shakha vikaron kaa samaadhaan khojati he use asaamaanya manovigyaan kaha jaataa he
 You might be surprised to know that children can also become psychotic
 dsam, kaa chauthaa sanskaran baalyavastha ke vibhinn prakaar ke vikaron kaa samaadhaan dhundta he, aamtaur par yah pehali baar shaishavkaal, baalyavastha yaa kishoravastha main pahchaan main aate hai
 Some of these careful-absence hyperactive disorders are found in which the child is not careful or focused or he behaves very agile
 or swalin vikaar jisamen baccha antarmukhi ho jaataa he, bilkul nahin muskuraataa or der se bhashaa sikhta he
 If a person feels scared, scared or anxious without any specific reason, then it can be said that the person is suffering from anxiety disorder
 vyagrata vikaar ke vibhinn prakaar hote hai jisamen chintaa kii bhaavana vibhinn roopon main dikhaai detii he
 Some of these disorders are caused by extreme and unconditional fear of something and obsessive-compulsive disorder where a person keeps thinking the same thing again and again and repeating their actions
 ve vyakti jo manodasha vikaar ke anubhavon se grasit hote hai unke manobhaav dirghakaal tak pratibandhit ho jate hai, ve vyakti kisi ek manobhaav par sthir ho jate hai, yaa in bhaavon kii shreniyon main adal-badal karte rahete hai
 For example, whether a person remains depressed for a few days or remains depressed on one day and remains happy the next day, his behavior has nothing to do with the situation
 is tarah vyakti ke vyavhaarik lakshanon par ashrith manodasha vikaar do prakaar ke hote hai - Depression is a mental state that is characterized by sadness, lack of interest and lack of pleasure in daily activities, restless sleep and loss of sleep, less hunger, no weight loss, or more hunger and weight gain, laziness, feeling guilty , Shows disqualification, helplessness, despair, Shani in establishing concentration and signs of negative ideology towards herself and others
 yadi kisi vyakti ko is tarah ke bhav nunatam do saptaah tak rahen to use avsaadagrast kaha ja saktaa he or us ke upachaar ke liye use sheeghra naidanik chikitsa pradaan karwaanaa aavashyak he
 In today's time, some diseases have become very common such as low blood pressure, high blood pressure, diabetes etc
 vaise to ye sab shaareerik bimaariyaan hai parantu ye manavaigyanik kaarnon jaise tanaav va chintaa se utpann hoti hai
 So psychosomatic disorders are psychological problems that exhibit physical symptoms, but are psychological due to this
 vahiin manodaihik kii avadharana main man kaa arth maanas he or daihik kaa arth sharir he
 Conversely, somatic disorders are disorders whose symptoms are physical but their biological causes are not revealed
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi koi vyakti petdard kii shikaayat kar rahaa he parantu tab bhi jab uske us khaas ang arthath pet main kisi tarah kii koi samasya nahin hoti
 After a traumatic event, a person is unable to recognize his / her past existence, past events and the people around them
 naidanik manovigyaan main is tarah kii samasyaon ko vighatnsheel vikaar kaha jaataa he, jisamen kisi vyakti kaa vyaktitv samajadhut va samaaj se pruthak ho jaataa he
 Disruptive amnesia is a class of disruptive psychosis in which a person is usually unable to recall important personal information after a stressful event
 vighatan kii sthiti main vyakti apane naye astitv ko mahasoos karata he
 The second category is disruptive identity disorder in which a person loses his memory, while he starts imagining a new existence
 anya varg vyaktitwalope vikaar he, jisamen vyakti achaanak badlaav yaa bhinn prakaar se vicitra mahasoos karata he
 a person feels as if he has abandoned his body or his movements suddenly become mechanical or dreamlike
 haalanki vighatan manovikar kii sab se gambheer sthiti tab utpann ho ti he jab koi ekaadhik vyaktitv manovikar va vighatan astitv manovikar se grast ho
 In this situation diverse personalities appear at different times in the same person
 aapane sadak par kabhi kisi vyakti ko gande kapadon main, kooday ke aasapaas pade asvachh bhojan ko khate yaa phir ajeeb tareeke se baatcheet yaa vyavhaar karte hue dekha hoga
 They have a weak orientation in terms of person, place and time
 ham aksar unhen pagal, besudha aadi kah dete hai, parantu naidanik bhashaa main inhen manovidhlit kehete hai
 This is a serious state of psychosis, which results from disturbed thoughts, feelings and behavior
 manovidalan vikaron main asangat maansikta, doshapurn abhigna, sanchaalak kaaryakalapon main baadha, neeras va anupyukt bhav hote hai
 People suffering from this are obsessed with reality and often get lost in the world of fantasy and misconception
 vibhranti kaa arth kisi aisi cheez ko dekhnaa he jo vastav main bhautik rup se vahaan nahin hoti, kuch aisi awaajen jo vahaan par vastav main nahin hai
 Illusionism is blind faith in reality
 Such beliefs dissuade others
 manovidalan ke vibhinn prakaar hai jaise catatonic manovidalan
 The personality disorder has its roots in a person's infancy, where some children develop a maladaptive and impolite ideology
 ye vibhinn vyaktitv manovikar vyakti main hanirahit algaav se le kar bhaavanahin kramik hatyare ke rup main saamne aate hai
 The categories of personality psychosis can be classified into three groups
 pehle, samooh kii visheshta ajeeb or sanakee vyavhaar he
 Anxiety and doubt are characteristic of the second group and the third group is characterized by dramatic, emotional and erratic behavior
 pehle samooh main vyamohabh, intarvabandha, pagal vyaktitv vikaar sammilit hai
 The second group is characterized by dependent, altered, obsessive personality psychosis
 asaamaajik, simavarti, abhinay, atmmohi vyaktitv vikaar tisare samooh ke antargat aate hai
 To deal with any type of psychosis, the person is served by some specialized psychotherapeutic procedure
 vah vyakti jo manashchikitsa ke craryakram kaa praaroop tay karata he vah prashikshit vyakti hota he, jise naidanik manovaigyanik yaa manochikitsak kehete hai
 The person who gets this treatment is called a servant / patient
 manashchikitsa ko aksar vaarta upachaar kaha jaataa he kyon ki ye antarvaiyaktik sampark dwaara pradaan kii jaati he
 Its drugs can only be given by a psychiatrist, who is a medicinal doctor
 There are various techniques of psychiatry, which describe the cause and development of abnormal behaviors
 inamen manovishleshan, vyavhaar chikitsa, sangyanatmak-vyavhaar chikitsa, sevaarthee kendrit chikitsa ityadi sammilit hai
 Psychiatry is a designed scheme that is designed keeping in mind the nature and severity of psychosis
 vyakti tanaav se nipatane ke liye aamtaur par kaary-abhivinyast or pratiraksha-abhivinyast yaa manobhaav kendrit prakriyaaon kaa paalan karata he
 The purpose of the work oriented process is to find a realistic solution to the adjusting demand imposed by a particular stress factor
 ye chetan or tarksangat str par tanaavpurn sthitiyon ke vastunishth moolyankan par aadhaarit hoti hai
 These methods of dealing with stress are divided into three categories such as initiation, withdrawal and compromise
 manobhaav kendrit yaa aatmaraksha-abhivinyast tareekon se tanaav kaa saamana karnaa laabhakaari siddh nahin hota, kyonki vyakti iske dwaara kisi samaadhaan par nahin pahunchataa, bas swayan ko aashwaasan dene ke tareeke dhundta he
 An example of self-preservation methods is intelligent interpretation such as arguing that all students failed because exam papers were difficult
 iskaa anya udhaaharan he visthaapan karnaa jaise sakht adhyaaapak par aa rahe krodh ko apane chote bhai ko daant yaa maar kar utaarna
 Here you have displaced anger
 yah samajhnaa bahut mahatvapurn he ki tanaav se prabhaavshaalee tareeke se nipatane ke liye vyakti ko swasth jeevanstyli ko apnaanaa chahie
 Stress cannot be better dealt with only by positive thinking, emotions and actions, but by this we feel very happy and light in life, and become more worthy
 maansik vikaar bahut tarah ke hote hai
 These disorders can be related to personality, mood, eating habits, anxiety etc
 is prakaar maansik rogon kii suchi bahut badi he
 a list of some main psychiatrists is given below- manorogon ke kaaran kai prakaar ke hote hai
 The following are the main types of these: anuvanshik :manoveekshipti yaa psychosis, vyaktitv rog, madirapan, mandabuddhi, mirgee ityadi rog un logon main adhik paye jate hai, jinke parivaar kaa koi sadsy inase peedit hon to santan ko inkaa khatra lagbhag doguna ho jaataa he
 Affective diseases, hysteria, heart disease, etc
 are more prevalent in macro individuals, whereas fragmented psychosis, stress, personality diseases are more common in people with long and lean formation
 apane main khoye hue, chup rahane vaale, kam mitra rakhane vaale kitaabi-keede jaise gun vaale, skijid vyaktitv vaale logon main schijophreniya adhik hota he, jabaki anushaasit tathaa safai pasand, samaynishth, mitavyayi jaise gunon vaale khapati vyaktitv ke logon main khapat rog adhik paaya jaataa he
 Physical changes such as adolescence, puberty, old age, pregnancy can form the basis of many psychiatric conditions
 kuch dawaaon, rasinic tatwon, dhaatuon, madiraa tathaa anya maadak padaarthon ityadi kaa seven manorogon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ban saktaa hai
 Stress in mutual relations, death of a loved one, loss of respect, loss of work, financial loss, marriage, divorce, childbirth, retirement, examination or failure in love, etc
 also contribute to creating or enhancing psychopaths
 Huh
 saamaajik evam manoranjak gatividhiyon se duraav, akelaapan, raajnneetik, prakritik yaa saamaajik durghatnaayen manorog utpann kar sakate hai
 Mental illness or insanity is a term with which many misconceptions and apprehensions are attached about its causes and treatment
 kuch log ise ek asaadhya, anuvaanshik evam chhot kii beemaari maanate hai, to kuch jaadu-tona, bhoot-pret va dian kaa prakope
 Some even consider it as a drama to avoid responsibilities rather than disease
 agyani log upachaar ke liye sthaneey yaa najadik ojha, pandit, mullah aadi ke paas jaakar anaavashyak bhabhoot, jadi-booti kaa seven karte hai tathaa amanviya bhang se sataaye jate hai taaki 'pishachatma' kaa prakope dur kiya ja sake
 All of this is wrong
 sahi dharna yah he ki yah beemaari he or vaigyanik dhang se chikitsa vigyaan dwaara iskaa ilaaj sambhav he
