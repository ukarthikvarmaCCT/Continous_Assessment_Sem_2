 Samudra Manthan is a famous Hindu religious legend
 yah katha bhagwat puraana, mahabharat tathaa vishnu puraana main aati he
 Shri Shukdev Ji said, "O Rajan! In the kingdom of King Bali, demons, demons and demons had become very strong
 unhen shukracharya kii shakti praapt thi
 Meanwhile, Devraj Indra became powerless due to the curse of Durvasa Rishi
 daityaraj bali kaa rajya teenon lokon par tha
 The gods including Indra were afraid of him
 is sthiti ke nivaaran kaa upaay keval baikunthanath vishnu hi bataa sakate the, atah brahma ji ke saath samast devtaa bhagwaan narayan ke paas pahuche
 Praising him, he narrated his calamity to Lord Vishnu
 tab bhagwaan madhur vaani main bole ki is samay tum logon ke liye sankat kaal he
 Demons, demons and demons are getting uplifted and you people are getting downgraded
 kintu sankat kaal ko maitreepurn bhav se vyateet kar dena chaiye
 You befriend the demons and churn the Kshira Sagar and drink nectar from it and drink it
 daityon kii sahaayta se yah kaary sugamawa se ho jaayegaa
 Accept their every condition for this work and in the end take out your work
 amrit pikar tum amar ho jaaoge or tumme daityon ko maarane kaa samarthy aa jaayegaa
 "according to the Lord's order, Indra told Bali about the elimination of nectar from the churning of the sea
 daityaraj bali ne devraj indra se samjhauta kar liya or samudr manthan ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 The Mandarachal mountain was made a churner and Vasuki Nag a neti
 vasuki ke netra se netag kaa udbhav hua
 Lord Vishnu himself took the Kachhap avatar and placed Mandarachal mountain on his back and became its base
 bhagwaan narayan ne daanav rup se daanvon main or devtaa rup se devataaon main shakti kaa sanchaar kiya
 By giving deep sleep to Vasuki Nag too, he defeated his suffering
 devtaa vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney lage
 The demons, demons, demons and demons with vomiting intellect thought that there would be some benefit in catching Vasuki Nag from his mouth
 unhone devataaon se kaha ki ham kisi se shakti main kam nahin hai, ham munh kii ore kaa sthaan lenge
 Then the gods took the place on the tail side of Vasuki Nag
 "samudr manthan armbh hua or bhagwaan kacchap ke ek lakh yojan chaudee peeth par mandarachal parvat ghoomane laga
 Hey Rajan! The first to speak of sea churning was the poison of water
 us vish kii jwaala se sabhi devtaa tathaa daitya jalane lage or unki kaanti feeki padane lagi
 Everyone prayed to Lord Shankar on this
 unki prarthana par mahadev ji us vish ko hatheli par rakh kar use pi gayi kintu use kanth se neeche nahin utarane diya
 Due to the effect of that Kalkut poison, Shiva's gorge turned blue

 a little poison had dripped from his palm on the earth, which poisonous animals like snakes, scorpions, took
 "vish ko shankar bhagwaan ke dwaara paan kar lene ke pashchaat phir se samudr manthan prarambh hua
 The second jewel came out the Kamadhenu cow, which was kept by the sages

 After that Airavat elephant came out which was taken by Devraj Indra
 airavat ke pashchaat kaustubhamani samudr se nikali use vishnu bhagwaan ne rakh liya
 Then Kalpavriksha came out and Apsara named Rambha emerged
 in donon ko devloak main rakh liya gaya
 Next, Lakshmi came out from churning the sea
 lakshmi ji ne swayan hi bhagwaan vishnu ko var liya
 After that Varuni appeared in the form of a girl whom the demons assumed
 phir ek ke pashchaat ek chandramaa, parijaat vriksh tathaa shankh nikle or ant main dhanvantari vaidya amrit kaa ghat lekar prakat huye
 "the demons snatched the nectar from Dhanvantari's hand and started fighting for it among themselves
 devataaon ke paas durvasa ke shaapvash itani shakti rahi nahin thi ki ve daityon se ladakar us amrit ko le saken isaliye ve niraash khadey huye unka aapas main ladanaa dekhte rahe
 Seeing the despair of the Gods, Lord Vishnu immediately took the form of Mohini and reached the demons fighting among themselves
 us vishwamohini rup ko dekhakar daitya tathaa devataaon kii to baat hi kya, swayan brahmagyani, kaamdev ko bhasma kar dene vaale, bhagwaan shankar bhi mohit hokar unki ore baar-baar dekhne lage
 When the demons saw that new young girl coming towards them, then they forgot all their quarrel and started looking at the beautiful girl and looked at them
 ve daitya bole, "he sundari! tum koun ho? lagata he ki hamaare jhagade ko dekhakar uskaa nibatara karne ke liye hi ham par krupa kataaksh kar rahi ho
 Come on! You are welcome
 hamen apane sundar kar kamalon se yah amritpan karaao
 Vishnu as Vishnu Mohini said, "O gods and demons!" Due to being the son of Maharishi Kashyap ji, both of you are brother and brother, yet you fight with each other
 main to swechhacharini stri hoon
 Wise people never believe such a woman, then how are you believing in me? It is good that you all join yourself and take Amritpan
 " On hearing such proverbial words of Vishwamohini, those humble demons, demons and asuras got more faith in him
 ve bole, "sundari! ham tum par purna vishwaas he
 We will consume Amritpan in the same way you will share
 tum ye ghat le lo or ham sabhi main amrit vitaran karo
 "vishwamohini took the nectar and asked the gods and the demons to sit in separate rows
 uske baad daityon ko apane kataaksh se madahosh karte huye devataaon ko amritpan karaane lage
 The demons became so obsessed with their sarcasm that they forgot to drink nectar
 bhagwaan kii is chaal ko rahu naamak daitya samaj gaya
 He sat in the gods, making the form of the deity and put the received nectar in the mouth
 jab amrit uske kanth main pahunch gaya tab chandramaa tathaa surya ne pukaar kar kaha ki ye rahu daitya he
 Hearing this, Lord Vishnu immediately separated his head from the neck with his Sudarshan Chakra
 amrit ke prabhaav se uske sir or dhad rahu or ketu naam ke do grah ban kar antariksh main sthapit ho gayi
 He is the one who gets the sun and the moon due to hatred

 Power was limited to his close relatives and friends

81; 85 Anti Konch is a village in Gaya, Bihar
 kumbhandas ashtchhaap ke prasiddh kavi the
 He was a contemporary of Paramanand Das ji
 kumbhandas kaa charit "churaasi vaishnavan kii vaarta" ke anusaar sankalit kiya jaataa he
 Kumbhandas lived in a village called "jamunavatau", some distance away from Mount Govardhan in Braj
 unke ghar main kheti-baadi hoti thi
 From his village, he used to go to Parsoli Chandrasarovar to do kirtan in Srinathji's temple
 unka janm gaurava kshatriya kul main hua tha
 Kumbhandas had seven sons, except Chaturbhajadas who were engaged in all agricultural activities
 unhone 1492 i0 main mahaprabhu vallabhacharya se diksha lee thi
 He was completely disgusted and far from wanting money, honor, dignity
 ek baar akbar badshaah ke bulaane par inhen fatehpur sikri janaa padaa jahaan inkaa bada sammaan hua
 But he was equally sorry for this, as expressed by his post- anumaanath: kumbhandas ji kaa janm govardhan,mathura ke sannikat jamunaavato naamak gram main samvath 1525 vikrami main caitra krishna ekadshi ko hua tha
 He was a Gorwa Kshatriya
 unke pita ek saadhaaran shrenee ke vyakti the
 He used to do farming and make a living
 kumbhandas ne bhi paitruk vritti main hi aasthaa rakhi or kisaani kaa jivan hi unhen acha laga
 Parsoli was particularly cultivated
 unhen paise kaa abhaav aaajeevan khatkata rahaa par unhone kisi ke saamne haath nahin pasaara
 Bhagavadhakti was his property
 unka kutumb bahut bada tha, kheti kii aay se uskaa paalan karte the
 In addition to his wife in the family, he had seven sons, seven sons-in-law and a widow's niece
 kumbhandas param bhagavadbhakt, adarsh grihasth or mahaan virakt the
 He was a disinterested, renunciate and great conspirator
 nake charitra kii vishisht, aloukikta yah thi ki bhagwaan saakshaat prakat hokar unke saath sakha bhav kii kridaayen karte the
 Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya Ji was his deeksha-guru
 samvath 1550 vikrami main acharya kii govardhan yatra ke samay unhone brahmasambandh liya tha
 Fifteen years before his initiation period, the idol of Shrinath ji had appeared, he started serving Shrinath ji with the permission of Acharya
 'pushtimaarg' main dikshit tathaa shrinath ji ke mandir main kirtankaar ke pad par niyukt hone par bhi unhone apni vritti nahin chodi or ant tak nirdhanavastha main apane parivaar kaa bharan-poshan karte rahe
 In the temple of Srinath ji, Kumbhandas started singing new verses regularly
 'pushti sampradaay' main sammilit hone par unhen kirthan kii hi seva di gayi thi
 Kumbhandas considered Bhagavatkripa to be paramount, even in the biggest domestic crisis, he never deviated from his path of faith
 shrinath ji ke shringaar sambandhi padon kii rachana main unki vishesh abhiruchi thi
 Once Vallabhacharya ji was pleased with his couple's post regarding Leela and said - "'you have felt the juice of Nikunj Leela
 " kumbhandas mahaprabhu kii krupa se gadgad hokar bol uthe ki- "mujhe to isi ras kii nitant aavashyaktaa he
 " mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ke lila-pravesh ke baad kumbhandas gosai vittalanath ke sangrakshan main rahakar bhagwaan kaa lila-gaan karne lage
 Vitthalnath Maharaj had great kindness on him
 ve man-hi-man unke nirlobh jivan kii saraahna kiya rate the
 He was counted among the 'poets of Ashtachhap' in Samvat 1602 Vikrami
 bade-bade raja-maharaja aadi kumbhandas kaa darshan karne main apana saubhaahgya maanate the
 The great rasikas and saint mahatmas of Vrindavan used to wish their satsang excellently
 unhone bhagavadbhakti kaa yash sadaa akshunn rakhaa, aarthik sankat or deenta se use kabhi kalankit nahin hone diya
 Once Srivitthalnath wanted to take him along on his journey to Dwarka, he thought that his financial condition would be improved by the offering of Vaishnavas
 kumbhandas shrinath ji kaa viyog ek pal ke liye bhi nahin sah sakate the, par unhone gosai ji kii ajna kaa virodh nahin kiya
 He had gone to the Apsara Kunda with Gosainji to remember that the beauty of Shrinath ji rose from his limbs, the joy of the sweet sweet smile of God rose in the darkness, his heart was hurt by the pain of Madhuryasamrat Nandanandan Are you done? unhone shrinath ji ke viyog main ek pad gaaya- This rare song had a big impact on Srigosai Ji's heart
 ve nahin chaahate the kumbhandas pal bhar ke liye bhi shrinath ji se alag rahen
 He returned to Kumbhandas
 shrinath jika darshan karke kumbhandas swasth hue
 Once, in the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar, a singer sang the post of Kumbhandas
 badshaah ne us pad se aakrisht hokar kumbhandas ko fatehpur sikri bulaayaa
 At first, Kumbhandas did not want to go, but seeing the special request of soldiers and messengers, he went on foot
 shrinath ji ke sabha sadsy ko akbar kaa aishwarya do kaudi kaa laga
 Kumbhandas's turban was torn, his body was dirty, he was drowning in self-guilt as to which sins he had to appear in front of
 badshaah ne unki badi aavbhagat kii, par kumbhandas ko to aisa laga ki kisi ne unako narak main laakar khadaa kar diya he
 They started thinking that there is a better Braj than Raj Sabha, in which Srinathji himself keeps playing, doing many sports
 akbar ne pad gane kii prarthana kii
 Kumbhandas was a poet of Lord Krishna's majesty, he performed the song - badshaah sahruday the, unhone adarpurvak unako ghar bhej diya
 Maharaja Mansingh visited Braj in Samvat 1620 Vikrami
 unhone vrindavan ke darshan ke baad govardhan kii yatra kii
 Visited Shrinathji
 us samay mrudang or veena ke saath kumbhandas ji kirthan kar rahe the
 Raja Mansingh was greatly influenced by his style of singing
 ve unase milane jamunaavato gayi
 He was amazed to see Kumbhandas's poor condition
 kumbhandas bhagwaan ke rup-chintan main dhyansth the
 On opening his eyes, he asked his niece for posture and mirror, he got the answer that 'the posture was eaten, the mirror was drunk
 ' aashay yah tha ki pani main mukh dekhakar ve tilak karte the
 Maharaja Mansingh came to know of his poverty
 unhone sone kaa darpan dena chaha, bhagwaan ke bhakt ne asweekaar kar diya, moharon kii thili deni chaahi, vishwapati ke sevak ne uski upeksha kar di
 While walking, Mansingh wanted to name the village of Jambuwato Kumbhandas, but he said that "my work is done only by the curry tree and the plum tree
" " raja maansingh ne unki ni:sprihata or tyaag kii saraahna kii, unhone kaha ki "maaya ke bhakt to maine bahut dekhe hai, par vaastavik bhagavadbhakt to aap hi hai
 " vriddhavastha main bhi kumbhandas nity jamunaavato se shrinath ji ke darshan ke liye govardhan aayaa karte the
 One day he stopped near Anodar on the connecting rod
 'ashtchhaap' ke prasiddh kavi chaturbhujadas ji, unke chote putr saath the
 He told Chaturbhuj Das that "now what to do by walking home
" kuch samay baad sharir hi chhootane vaala he
 "gosain Vitthalnathji was present at the time of his death
 gosai ji ne poocha ki "is samay man kis lila main laga he?" kumbhandas ne kaha- laal teri chitwan chitai churaavai or iske anantar yugal swaroop kii chhavi ke dhyaan main pad gaaya- He left the body
 gosai ji ne karun swar se shradhanjali arpit kii ki aise bhagavdiy antardhan ho gayi
 Now the realization of the true Bhagavadkthas on earth was in fact a symbol of disinterestedness, an ideal of renunciation and penance, the ultimate Bhagavadiyya and the simple householder

 On the other hand, Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union wrote in a letter to Kennedy that "the action of his quarantine" of international waterways and skyway traffic is an aggression that will put mankind in the inferno of the world nuclear-missile war

 CIA Director John A

 In its memoirs published in 1970, Khrushchev wrote, "in addition to protecting Cuba, our missiles will begin to equalize what the West has to balance with power
 Where does " Soviet Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev had the idea of responding to the development and deployment of strategic United States missiles in May 1962 by deploying his mid-range nuclear missiles in Cuba

 Told

 Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that losing Cuba would have to harm communist doctrine, especially in Latin America
 He said he wanted a confrontation with the Americans "rather than words 


 the logical answer was missile

 " With these missiles, the Soviet Union virtually took the entire continental United States under its effective target
 chalis laancharon kaa yojit shastraagaar tha
 The Cuban population immediately noted the arrival and deployment of the missiles, and hundreds of reports reached Miami
 The US Intelligence Department received numerous reports, many of them suspicious or ridiculous, and most of them could be dismissed as defensive missiles

 Those reports described night-long transport of very tall canvas-covered cylinders from cities via trucks, which could not be diverted to cities without help and tact

 The US had no plans in fact, because the US intelligence department was confident that the Soviet Union would never deploy a nuclear missile in Cuba
 Exom quickly discussed five possible action sequences: sanyukt chinas of staff ne sarvasammati se sahmati vyakt kii ki ek purna-paimaane par hamalaa or hastkshep hi ekmaatr samaadhaan he
 They believed that the Soviet Union would not attempt to stop the US from conquering Cuba
 kennedy uljhan main the
 They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something
 They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing
 If they don't take action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin
 kennedy ne sochaa ki cuba par hawaii hamalaa karne se soviet yah maan lenge ki berlin ko adheen karne ke liye "ek hari jhandi" kaa signal mil gaya he
 Kennedy also believed that US allies would think that Berlin lost the US as a "war-loving cowboy" because of not finding a peaceful solution to the Cuban situation
 :332 Exom then discussed the strategic balance of power, the impact on both political and military
 sanyukt chinas of staff kaa maananaa tha ki mixilon se sainya santulan gambhir rup se badal jayega, lekin raksha sachiv robert mkanmara ne isse asahmati jataayi

 1990 main unhone doharaaya ki "isse koi antar nahin aayaa
 

the military balance had not changed
 main tab bhi nahin maananaa tha or main ab bhi nahin maanata hum
" Exom agreed, however, that the political balance was being affected by the missiles
 sabase pehle, kennedy ne sankat se ek maah pehle america janata se spasht vaada kiya tha ki "agar america ke khilaaf aakraamak karrwai karne laayak kshamta se sampann hota he
 

 Then America Will Take Action, ": 674-681 Second, would damage the us's credibility between its allies and the American public if they allowed the Soviet Union to change the strategic balance by deploying missiles in Cuba
 Huh

 However, United States Army units were having trouble organizing mechanized and allied material, while the US Navy could not even supply a sufficient supply of amphibious navigation to send a simple armored troop of the Army
 OPLAN 312, jo mukhyatah ek vaayu sena or nausena samvahak aaparishan tha, jise kisi khaas missile adde se kisi bhi bhadakaau gatividhi se nipatane ke liye kaaphi lacheela banaaya gaya tha, taaki OPLAN 316 kii jamini sena ko hawaii madad di ja sake
 On Sunday, October 21, Kennedy met Exom members and other top advisors throughout the day and considered two options: mainly air strikes on Cuban missile bases, or Cuban maritime blockades
 a full-scale invasion was not the first option of administration, but something had to be done
 robert mecnaimara ne samudri nakebandi ko ek majboot magar simit sainya karrwai ke rup main samarthan kiya taaki USSR kaa niyantran bana rahe
 According to international law, the blockade is a war action, but the Kennedy administration did not think that mere blockade would provoke the USSR to attack
 nausena parichaalan pramukh admiral anderson ne ek sthiti dastavej likhaa, jisase kennedy ko aakraamak hathiyaaron ke sangrodh or sabhi saamagree kii nakebandi ke bich fark karne main madad mili, sanket diya ki ek paaramparik nakebandi kaa moulik iraadaa nahin he
 Since it was scheduled to take place in international waters, President Kennedy received approval from the OAS to take military action under the hemispheric defense provisions of the Rio Treaty
 Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the U
S
 Commander South Atlantic at Trinidad on 9 November
 An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required
 In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers and one submarine had reported to COMSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2
 The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of Chaguaramas Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the quarantine
 The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship
 Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the U
S
 to discuss this assistance
 The Argentine Air Force informally offered three SA-16 aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the quarantine operation
 This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the Organization of American States and the Rio Treaty
 Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport
 The action was to be backed up by surveillance of Cuba
 The cno's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the quarantine

 It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union
 Kennedy described the administration's plan: To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated
 All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation and port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back
 This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers
 We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948
 During the speech, instructions for US forces around the world to be placed at DEFCON 3 were issued

 However, after this, at 9:24 pm, a wire sent by Khrushchev was received by Kennedy at 10:52 pm EST, in which Khrushchev said, "if you look at the evolving situation with impunity, you will understand with a cool mind
 That the Soviet Union would not shy away from rejecting America's arbitrary demands, "and that the Soviet Union views the blockade as" an attack action "and instructed its ships to ignore it Ayenge

 On 25 October Thursday morning at 1:45 EST, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by saying that the US had been forced into action, constantly assuring us that there were no offensive weapons in Cuba
 And when these assurances proved to be wrong, then the reactions against the deployment "became necessary which i have announced

 Robert Kennedy called it "a very long and emotional letter"
 Khrushchev reiterated the basic framework, which John Scalley had been told the day before, "I propose: on our part we will declare that there will be no weapons in our ships for Cuba
 You will declare that The United States will not attack Cuba and will not support any other forces that intend to attack Cuba
 Then our military specials in Cuba Jtron is no longer requires the presence of

 Contrary to last night's letter, a new proposal was made in this message that if the Jupiter missiles were removed from Italy and Turkey, the missiles would be withdrawn from Cuba in return
 At 10:00 am EST, the Executive Committee met again to discuss the situation and concluded that the message changed after internal arguments between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin

 i therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive 

 Your representatives will make a declaration to the effect that the United States 


 will remove its analogous means from Turkey 


 and after that, the persons entrusted by the United Nations Security Council could inspect on the spot the fulfillment of the pledges made

 Kennedy had already stated that he would order an attack on those sites if an attack occurred, but decided that he would not do so until a second attack
 40 saalon ke baad mecnaimara ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha: We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational
 We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that — the Cubans did not have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did — we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air -missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict
 And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we would not meet, we'd simply attack
 It was shot down on Friday
 Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought "well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack
" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation

 White House special counsel and advisors Ted Sorrensen and Robert Kennedy went to the meeting and returned 45 minutes later with the effect of a draft letter
 The President had made several changes, typed and sent it
 exom kii baithak ke baad, ovel karyaalay main ek or choti baithak jari rahi
 The team argued that the letter given to Ambassador Dobranin should be outlined with a verbal message saying that if missiles were not lifted, military action would be taken to remove them
 Dean Rusk added a provision that Turkey would not be mentioned anywhere in the language of the agreement, but there would be an agreement that the missiles would be "voluntarily" removed immediately thereafter
 The President agreed to this and the message was sent
 juon brito kii guzarish par fomin or scally phir se mili
 Scali asked why Khrushchev's two letters were so different, so Fomin claimed that it might have happened because of "poor communication"
 scally ne jawaab diya ki yah daawa vishwasaneey nahin or ve chillaaye ki unhen sochaa ki yah "ek bekaar dhokhaa tha"

 Scally said he did not think anyone would believe it, but they agreed to give the message

 Within the US establishment, it was well understood that Khrushchev was in a terrible situation, ignoring the second proposal and accepting the first
 sainya taiyaariyaan jari rahi or sambhavit karrwai ke liye air force ke sabhi adhikariyon ko sakriy duty ke liye unke addon par waapas bula liya gaya
 Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood, saying, "we did not give up hope, but what could be expected now when Khrushchev revisited his position in the next few hours
" yah ek ummid thi, na ki apeksha
 mangalvaar yaa sambhavat: kal tak sainya sangharsh kii apeksha thi
 

 " raat 8:05 iesti ek patr agle din die jane ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya
 The message was like, "as i read your letter, the main points of your proposal - as much as i could understand them, seem to be acceptable - which are the following: 1) You can get these weapons systems from Cuba to the UN proper supervision
" And have agreed to withdraw with proper security under surveillance and not keep such weapon systems in Cuba

 The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure that it would not be "late"

 However, as Robert Kennedy mentioned, there was a small expectation that it would be accepted
 Exom again met at 9:00 pm EST to consider the next day's action

 In a formal letter, he added: "my letter to you on October 27, and your reply today, i consider the firm undertaking of our two governments, which should be continued with vigor 


 In the context of Cuba the Security Council Under the framework, the US would make a statement that goes like this: It would be announced that the United States would respect the inviolability of Cuba's borders, its sovereignty

 The practical effect of this kennedy-khrushchev treaty was that it effectively strengthened Castro's position in Cuba, while also ensuring that the US would not invade Cuba
