 Global warming means the increase in the mean temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and ocean temperatures since the 20th century and its approximate continuity

 The inter-government panel sitting on climate change concludes that "the increase in the world's average temperature since the middle of the 20th century is primarily due to man-made greenhouse gases
" jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he, dharti ke vaataavaran ke taapmaana main lagaataar ho rahi vishwavyaapee badhotaree ko 'global varming' kaha ja rahaa he
 Our earth receives heat from the sun's rays
 ye kirane vayumandal se guzarati huin dharti kii sataha se takaraati hai or phir vahiin se paravartit hokar pun: laut jaati hai
 The Earth's atmosphere is made up of several gases, including some greenhouse gases

 It is worth noting that at least 16 degree Celsius temperature is necessary for humans, creatures and plants to survive

 In such a situation, this cover starts to prevent more rays of the sun and then from here the effects of global warming begin
 ipisisi dwaara diye gayi jalwaayu parivartan ke model ingit karte hai ki dharaatal kaa ausat global taapmaana 21veen shatabdi ke dauraan or adhik bad saktaa he
 This rise in the temperature of the whole world can cause sea level rise, rise in extreme weather and significant changes in the amount and composition of rainfall
 global varming ke anya prabhaavon main krishi upaj main parivartan, vyapaar margon main sanshodhan, glacier kaa peeche hatana, prajatiyon ke vilupt hone kaa khatra aadi shaamil hai
 "global warming" refers to the warming in recent decades and its persistence, and its indirect effects on humans
 jalwaayu parivartan par sanyukt raashtra samjhaute kii ruparekha main "maanav dwaara kiye gaye parivartanon ke liye "jalwaayu parivartan or anya parivartano ke liye "jalwaayu parivartanshiltaa" shabd kaa istemaal kiya he
 The term "climate change" assumes that rising temperatures are not the only effect
 The term "anthropogenic global warming" is used many times when the focus is on human-induced change

 One such hypothesis proposes that heat can be a result of solar activity in different forms
 baadhyataa kaa koi bhi prabhaav taatkaalik nahin he
 The heat inertia of the Earth's oceans and the slow response to many indirect effects mean the Earth's current temperature is not in equilibrium with the pressure exerted on it
 Studies of climate commitment show that if greenhouse gases are stabilized at 2000 levels So to some extent even beyond this
 garmi dikhaai degi The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fournier and was first quantitatively investigated in 1896 by Scenti Arness
 yah prakriya dwaara jo avasorana or utsarjan ke avarakt vikiran dwaara vaataavaran main garm gaisen vaataavaran main ek or grah kii sataha kam he
 The existence as a greenhouse effect is thus not disputed
 swaabhaavik rup se green house gaison ke paas hone kaa matlab he ek garmi ke prabhaav ke bare main 33 degree celsius, jo prithvi par rahane yogya nahin honge
 
 Important greenhouse gases on the earth are water vapor, which produces 36–70 percent greenhouse effect); carbon dioxide that produces up to 9–26 percent greenhouse effect; methane up to 4-9 percent and ozone, which produces up to 3-7 percent effect
 The issue is how the power of the greenhouse effect changes when atmospheric concentrations of certain greenhouse gases increase from human activity
 audyogic kranti ke baad se maanvi gatividhi main vruddhi hui he jiske kaaran green house gaison ki maatra main bahut jiyaada vruddhi hui he, iske kaaran vikaranshil baadhya CO se2, methane, tropospheric ozon, siefasi or s nitrous bhi bahut bad gaye hai Iagara anu ki drushti se dekhen to methane greenhouse gasccharbon dioxide kii tulana main adhik prabhavi he, par uski sandratha itani kam he ki uskaa vikaranshil jor carbon dioxide ki tulana main keval ek chauthai he praaqatik rup se utpann hone vaali kuch duusari gaise greenhouse prabhaav main yogadan detii hai
 One of these nitrous oxide is developing due to human activities like agriculture! Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 have increased by 31% and 149% respectively since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700th century
 pichley 650,000 varshon ke dauraan kisi bhi samay se in staron ko kaaphi adhik mana ja rahaa he
 This is the period for which the reliable figures are ice cores
 Are derived from
 kam pratyaksh bhuvaigyanik pramaan se yah mana jaataa he ki CO2 kii itani zyada maatra pichhali baar 20 karod varsh pehle hui thi
 Burning of fossil fuels has increased at least one-third of the increase in CO2 from human activities in the last 20 years
 shesh kaary bhoomi ke upyog main parivartan ke kaaran se hota he visheshkar wanon kii kataai se aisa hota he
 Current vaso-atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are approximately 385 per million ppm) by volume
 bhavishya main CO2 kaa str zyada hone ki ashanka he kyunki jeevashm eendhan or bhoomi ke upyog main kaafii parivartan aa rahe hai vruddhi k dar anishchit aarthik, saamaajik, takneekee or prakritik ghatnaon par nirbhar karegi par shaayad aakhirkaar jeevashm eendhan kii uplabdhta hi nirnaayak sabit ho ipisisi kii utsarjan paridrishyon par vishesh report bhavishya ke kai CO2 paridrishyo ke bare main bataati he jo 2100 ke akhir tak 541 se lekar 970 pipiem tak ho sakate hai
 There are sufficient reserves of fossil fuels to reach this level and to continue emissions even after 2100 if coal, sand sand or methane claretrate are widely used
 jalwaayu par baadhk ghatakon ke prabhaav vibhinn prakriyaaon dwaara jatil ho jate hai
 One of the most obvious responses relates to water evaporation
 carbon daai oxide jaisi dirghakaalin greenhouse prabhaav vaali gaison ke milane se paidaa hone vaali garmi vayumandal main jal ke adhik maatra main vashpikaran kaa kaaran banataa he
 Because water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, it makes the atmosphere even hotter and it changes more water vapor into B) and this reaction continues until the recycling cycle is stopped
 Its effect from oxide will be huge
 yadhyapi pratyuttar kii yah prakriya vaayu kii nami ke kanon main badhotari karti he, tab bhi saapeksh ardrata yaa to sthir rahati he yaa thodi si ghat jaati he kyonki vaayu garm ho jaati he
 This effect of response can only be reversed slowly as carbon dioxide has a longer atmospheric lifespan
 badalon se prabhavit hone vaale pratyuttar ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 Seen from below, the cloud emits infrared radiation back to the surface and exerts a heat effect, seen from above, the clouds and sunlight emit space to reflect infrared radiation and therefore exert a cooling effect
 shuddh prabhaav kya garm athwa thanda he yah badal kii kism or unchai jaise vivaranon par nirbhar karata he
 These descriptions on climate models are difficult to demonstrate because clouds are much smaller than the points between spaces on computer mines of climate models
 jaise jaise vayumandal garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise paramarshi pratyuttar kii prakriya chook dar main parivartan se sambandhit hoti he
 As the temperature in the troposphere increases, the temperature of the atmosphere decreases
 avarakt vikiran kaa utsarjan taapmaana kii chauthi shakti par nirbhar karata he, vaataavaran kii upari tah se zyada lambi vikiran utsarjit hoti he or nichali tah se yah kam hoti he
 Most of the radiation that is emitted from the upper atmosphere goes into the hole, while the radiation emitted from the lower atmosphere is again absorbed by the atmosphere
 is prakaar, green house prabhaav vaataavaran main taapmaana ke oonchai ke saath kam hone kii raftaar pe nirbhar karata he, agar taapmaana kii dar kam he to green house asar zyada hoga or agar taapmaana girane kii dar kam he to green house asar kam hoga
 Both the theory and the model indicate that warming will reduce the temperature drop with altitude, creating a negative lapse rate feedback and weakening the greenhouse effect
 oonchai ke saath taapmaana parivartan kii dar kaa maapan choti-choti trutiyon ke prati bahut savendenshil hota he, isse yah pataa karnaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa he ki model hakeekat se mail khaataa he ke nahin 
 Another important process is the ice 'albedo response when the global temperature increases, then the ice near the poles starts melting at a faster rate
 jaise jaise barf pighalati he vaise vaise bhoomi athwa khulaa jal uskaa sthsthaan le letaa he
 Both land and water are less reflective than ice and therefore absorb more amount of solar radiation
 isse adhik garmi ho jaati he jiske kaaran or adhik barf pighalane lagati he tathaa yah chakra chalata rahata he
 Positive reorientation that occurs due to the emission of CO2 and CH4 is another reason that increases warming
 yah gaisen jamate hue permphrost jaise kii jamaa hui lakdi, siberia main daldal se paidaa hoti hai
 Likewise, methane clathrate, which is found in the oceans, emits enormous amounts of CH4, can be a major cause of warming, as the clathrate gun hypothesis states
 jaise jaise samudr garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise carbon ko alag karne kii kshamta ghatati jaati he
 This is because the declining levels of nutrients in the mesopelagic region are impeding the development of diatoms and favor small phytoplankton that are biological pumps of carbon
 pichley 30 varshon se Some papers suggest that the Sun's contribution has been underestimated
 Duke University ke do shodhakartaaon, Bruce West or Nicola Scafetta ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki surya ne 1900-2000 tak shaayad 45-50 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaane main yogadan diya he or 1980 or 2000 ke bich main lagbhag 25-35 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaaya he
 Climate models have been found by Peter Scott and other researchers to overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases and do not give much importance to solar forcing, suggesting that volcanic dust and sulfate aerosols are also underestimated
 Despite solar forcing, much of the warming is likely to be caused by greenhouse gases, especially from the mid-20th century

 It has also been suggested that the magnetic activity in the Sun also triggers cosmic rays which affect the condensation nuclei of clouds and also affect the climate

 Due to solar variation and volcanic activity, from the industrial age to the 1950s, the heat did not increase but only cooling

 According to the instrumental temperature record, the temperature of the Earth, whether on land or at sea, has increased from 1860–1900
 This increase in temperature is not affected by the urban heat island effect
 From 1079, the temperature of the land is almost double than the sea temperature
 The temperature in the lower troposphere is between 0
12 and 0
22 ° c per decade, as satellite data suggests
 It is believed that temperatures have remained relatively stable for the last one or two thousand years before 1850, with some regional fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period or the short icy era samudr main taapmaana zamin ke mukaable dhire badate hai kyunki mahasaagaron kii adhik heat capcity adhik hoti he or ve vashpikaran se jiada garmi kho sakate hanutari golardh main zamin jiada he isliye vah dakshini golardh kii tulana main jaldi garm hota he utari golardh main mausami barf or samudri barf ke vyapak ilaake hai jo kii ice-albedo feedback par nirbhar karte hai utari golardh main dakshini golardh ke mukaable adhik green house gaisen utsarjit kii jaati hai, par yah garmi main antar ke liye jimmedaar nahin he kyunki pramukh green house gaisen kaafii samay tak rahati hai or donon golardho main acchhee tarah ghul-mil jaati hai Based on estimates from nasa's Institute for Space Studies, 2005 was the hottest year, since the instrument of measurement became available in the late 1800s, breaking the 1998 record by a few hundredths of a degree from the World Meteorological Organization and Climate Research Unit The estimates drawn by 2005 concluded that 2005 was the second hottest year after 1998, as the temperature was unusually high in 1998 because that year El Niño's southern oscillations occurred Anthropogenic utsarjan ke anya pradooshak -visheshkar sulphate arosol sa-thanda karne vaala prabhaav daalate hai kyunki yah aati hui surya kii raushnee ko pratibimbit kar dete hai yah ek aanshik kaaran he us shitalan kaa jo beesvi sadi ke madhya main paaya gaya haalanki prakritik parivartanshiltaa ke kaaran bhi thandapan ho saktaa he
 James Hansen and his colleagues have proposed that the substances emitted from burning fossil fuels —CO2 and aerosols — have eliminated each other's effect, so the heat is mostly due to non-co2 greenhouse gases

 Natural objects, which correspond to fractals to a fraction, include clouds, mountain ranges, thunderclaps, coastlines, snowflakes, various vegetables and animal dyeing patterns
 However, not all self-similar objects are fractals — for example, the actual line is formally self-similar but does not have other fractal features; As such it is sufficiently regular that it can be described in Euclidean terms

 Finally, in 1975 Mandelbrot coined the term "fractal" to denote an object whose Hausdorff – Basikovich dimension exceeds its topological dimension
 He described this mathematical definition with an example of extraordinary computer-made imagery

 yah dua umr ke haq main qabool hui
 Omar had once set out with the intention of killing the Prophet, a man named Naeem was found on the way who told Omar that his sister and her husband had brought Islam
 umr gusse main aakar bahan ke ghar chal diye

 umr unase kuran maangane lage magar unhone manaa kar diya

 In the battle of Badr, Muslims were defeated and the Musharis of Mecca were defeated

 umr tathaa kuch log ye vishwaas hi naa rakhte the ki mohammad sahab kii mutyu bhi ho sakati he

 is najuk maukey par tabhi hazarat abu bakr ne musalamaanon ko ek khutaba arthath bhaashan diya jo bahut mashhoor he: Then read the verse of the Quran: hazarat abu bakr se sunakar tamaam log gash khaakar gir gayi, umr bhi apane ghutanon ke bal gir gayi tathaa is bahut baden du:kha ko sweekaar kar liya
 When Hazrat Abu Bakr felt that his time was near, he chose Hazrat Umar for the next Khalifa
 umr unki asaadhaaran ichha shakti, buddhi, raajnneetik, nishpakshta, nyaay or garibon or vanchiton logon ke liye dekhbhaal ke liye acchhee tarah se jane jate the
 Hazrat Abu Bakr was fully aware of Omar's power and his ability to succeed
 umr kaa uttaradhikaar is prakaar ke rup main dusron ke kisi bhi rup main pareshaani nahin tha
