 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency
 Mathematics in mathematics is a ordered pair of a set of points or a set of points { \ displaystyle} where x { \ displaystyle X} is a set and x 0 { \ displaystyle x_ {0}} is a component of the set x { \ displaystyle X} that is its base point
 And it is read as base point or basepoint

 Regular expression, also often referred to as a pattern, is a pointer that describes in detail a set of strings
 unka upyog aamtaur par tatwon kii suchi banaae bina set ke bare main sankshep main bataane ke liye hota he
 For example, 'set' which consists of three strings "handel", "händel" and "haendel" can be described as h ndel's pattern
 In most formalisms, if a regex matches a particular set, it should be known that there are an infinite number of such indicators

 "gray" or "gray" matches with | gray
 |grey or gry samroop patterns hai, jo "gray " or "grey " donon hi set ko varnit karte hai

 pattern milan: itihaas bhi dekhen Regular expression can be defined as formal language theory
 regular oxpraishan main sthiraank or operators hote hai, jo strings ke sets in seton par kriyashltaaon ko kramshah suchit karte hai
 The following definitions are standard and found in most textbooks of formal language theory
 Given a bounded alphabet Σ, the following constants are defined: nimnlikhit sankriyaayein paribhaashit hai: | denotes α in r and β in S}
 udhaaharan ke liye {"ab", "c"}{"d", "ef"} = {"abd", "abef", "cd", "cef"}
 | s which indicates the alliance of r and S
 udhaaharan ke liye {"ab", "c"}|{"ab", "d", "ef"} = {"ab", "c", "d", "ef"}
 To avoid parentheses, it has been assumed that clean star has the highest priority, followed by a combination and then a set alliance
 If there is no doubt, parentheses may be omitted
 udhaaharan ke liye, c ko abc or a|) ko a|bc* jaisaa bhi likhaa ja saktaa he
 Many textbooks use ∪, +, or ∨ signs for combination instead of perpendicular bars

 Languages are the standard example here
 Lk varna {{0}a,b } par jiskaa antim akshar k a kii barabari apane sabhi strings sahit karata he
 On the one hand, the regular expression describing l 4 is given by ∗ a { \ displaystyle ^ {*} a}

 As seen from the examples , various regular expressions can express the same language: formalism is unnecessary
 kalanvidhi main lekhan sambhav he jo die gaye regular oxpraishan ke madhya yah nirnay karne ke liye ki ullikhit bhashaaen anivaary rup se ek samaan hai ki nahin
 yah prayek abhivyakti ko nunatam niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin kii had tak kam kar detaa he or nirdhaarit karata he ki kya ve samakritik samakaksh hai yaa nahin
 To what extent can this redundancy be removed? Can we find an interesting subset of regular expressions that are fully suggestive? An alliance of clean stars and sets is obviously necessary, but perhaps we can ban their use

 neeche soochibaddh apwaadon ko aksharon se pare yaa anukramon se alag kaha jaataa he
 Examples: aksharon se pare kaa arth bekaslash se bachakar kuch aksharon ke liye POSIX vistrut regular oxpraishan ke vaakya-vinyas main vipareet he
 In this syntax itself, a backslash causes meta characters to be treated as literal characters
 atah udhaaharan ke liye, \ ab he or \ { \ } ab { }
 saath hi saath, pichley sandarbhon ke liye ko hataa liya gaya he or nimnlikhit aksharon se pare ko shaamil kiya gaya hai: Examples: |dog "cat " yaa "dog " ke saath mail khaataa he
 POSIX extended regular expressions can often be used with modern Unix applicability by including the command line flag -E

 This raises the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that can be used as identification marks
 sampadak Vim aage verde or verde-head shrenee ke bich antar spasht karte hue pahchaan bataate hai 
 chunki kai programing bhashaaon main jo akshar pahchaan chihn ke rup main aarambh kar sakate hai ve unke samaan nahin hai, jo anya sthiti main upasthit ho sakate hai
 It is noted that POSIX regular expression standards call character classes in the color of other regular expressions, which support them, they are commonly referred to as POSIX character classes
 adhikansh anya regular oxpraishan flavors ke saath kairactor claces pad-bandha kaa prayog POSIX nirdhaarit koshthak suchakon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Perl has a more consistent and rich syntax than POSIX Basic and Extended Regular Expression Standards
 isaki nirantarata kaa ek udhaaharan he ki \ hameshaa gaiyr-varnankit aksharon se alag bhaagta he
 Another example of functionality is possible with Perl, but not with POSIX - the subsequent regular expression concept of sluggish quantification
 vyapak rup se apni suchak kshamta ke kaaran kai anya prayojyata or programing kii bhashaaon ne vaakya-vinyas ko Perl kii hi tarah apana liya he -- udhaaharan ke liye, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's 
NET Framework or w3c's XML Schema sabhi regular oxpraishan vaakya-vinyas kaa prayog Perl kii hi tarah karte hai
 Some languages and tools such as Boost and PHP support multiple regular expression flavors
 Perl vyutpann regular oxpraishan ke karyanvayan main ekarupata nahin he or kuch keval Perl kii visheshtaon ke subset ko hi karyanvit karte hai
 The process of Perl 5

NET Framework and Java
 saral regular oxpraishan aisa vaakya-vinyas he, jinka prayog computer aplication program ke aitihaasik sanskarnon main kiya ja saktaa he evam apane antargat kuch anuprayogon ke dwaara sahyog bhi paa saktaa he
 It has been deemed inappropriate for the purpose of providing previous conformity
 regular oxpraishan main maanak parimaapak laalchee hai arthath ve jitna mail kha sakate hai adhik se adhik utani baar mail khate hai, baaki ko rijex ke saath koi nayaa mail khaane ke liye chhod dete hai
 For example, someone new to regexes who wants to find the first instance between a single item can find between the symbols in this example
 ek or whale explozan, ko ghatit hua
 


 who would like to come with the pattern or similar
 However this pattern would actually like to go back to "" instead of "", which was expected, because * quantification is greedy - so it would want to consume as many characters as possible from input, and "january 26>, "will have more characters than" January 26 "
 haalanki is samasya ko kai tareekon se taala ja saktaa he, aadhunik regular oxpraishan upkaran ek parimank ko sust ke rup main vaishishty paane kii anumati dete hai parimank ke baad ek prashnchihn lagaakar kiya jaataa he, athwa sanshodhak kaa prayog kar jo parimank ke laalach ko ulat detaa he 
 sust parimank kaa prayog kar suchak sabase pehle kam se kam mail khaane kii koshish karte hai
 Although slack mail is used in the preceding example to select one of the results of multiple matches, in some cases it can also be used for better performance, when greedy matching needs to backfire
 
 avyavasthit bhashaaon ke liye pattern aadhunik regular oxpraishan sangrahon se praapt kai visheshtaayen suchak kshamta pradaan karti he jo suvyavasthit bhashaaon se bhi adhik ho jaati he
 For example, many implementations allow the grouping of subindexers and reminds the value of matching in the same indicator
 iskaa arth yah he ki ek pattern duhraaye gaye shabdon kii ladiyon se mail kha saktaa he, jaise ki "papa " athwa "wikiwiki ", jise aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant main squares kehete hai
 The pattern for these battles is \ 1
 haalanki, squares kii bhashaa suvyavasthit nahin he
 Nor is it free from the subject
 back refrences kii aseemit sankhyaon pattern ke saath mail khaataa, jaise ki aseemit sankhya main aadhunik upkaran dwaara samarthit, en pi-sampoorn he 
 However, many tools, libraries and engines that provide such structures still use regular expression terminology for their patterns
 isane regular oxpraishan shabdaawalee kaa namakaran kiya he, jiske aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant tathaa pattern ke kai bhinn arth hai
 For this reason, some people use regex or simply pattern terminology to interpret the latter
 parl programing bhashaa ke lekhak, laire wal ek niabandh main parl 6 ke dizin ke bare main likhte hai: There are at least three different Kalaan methods, algorithms that determine how a given regular expression matches a string
 sabase puraane or sabase tej parinaam par nirbhar do aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant jo prayek garaniyatatmak parimit sthiti yantra ko niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin main roopantarit karnaa sweekaar karata he
 DFA can be explicitly constructed and then consequently operates on the input one symbol at a time
 ek regular oxpraishan ke aakaar ke liye DFA kaa nirmaan "O" kii keemat par karne par samay or smriti aa jaati he, lekin yah n aakaar ke string par hi o samay main chal saktaa he
 An alternative effort is to emulate the NFA directly, essentially creating each DFA position on demand and then dropping it out, possibly caching on the next step
 This keeps DFA implicit and the exponential cost of manufacture can be avoided, but the running cost increases to O
 is spasht padakshep ko DFA kalanvidhi kehete hai or antarnihit padakshep ko NFA kalanvidhi
 jaise ki ek samaan DFA ko kriyanvit karne main donon ko bhinn tareekon se dekha ja saktaa he, unhen bhi bina bhed-bhav ke aksar kalanvidhi kehete hai
 These algorithms are fast, but their use for returning grouped subheads is a tricky quantification and complicates similar features
 teesri kalanvidhi back trek ke dwaara pattern ke saath input string ke milan ke liye he
 This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but the terminology is unclear
 iskaa chalan samay ghaataanki ho saktaa he, jiskaa saral karyanvayan yah ujagar karata he ki jab suchakon ke khilaaf milan jaise ki *b jisame prayaavartan or aseemit parimann donon hi hai
 Emphasize the algorithm to consider the increasing exponential number of substitute cases
 More complex implementations often mark and speed up or cancel simple cases when their behavior is slowed
 haalanki back trekking karyanvayan sabase kharaab sthiti main ek ghaataanki guarantee dete hai, ve bahut adhik lacheelaapan or suchak shakti pradaan karte hai
 For example, any implementation that allows the use of backreferences or implements the various extensions implemented by Perl must use a back tracking implementation
 kuch karyanvayan sabase pehle tej DFA ko chalaakar do sabase acchhee kalan vidhiyaan uplabdh karaate hai, yah jaanane ke liye ki regular oxpraishan string ke saath thoda bhi mail khate hai yaa nahin or keval isi sthiti main sambhawatah mand back trekking milan hota he
 Regular expression was used with the letters ASCII
 kai regular oxpraishan ingine ab sampurna unicode ke saath bhi kaam kar sakate hai
 In most cases there is no difference in what the set of characters is, but in some cases there is a difference when regular expressions have to work on Unicode

 Kritika wa Kayabachiya is a constellation
 iskaa latin / angreji main naam Pleiades he
 This group of many stars appearing close to the earth when viewed from the earth has also been called the wives of Sapta Rishi in Indian astronomy and Hinduism
 krittika ek tarapunj he jo akaash main vrish raashi ke sameep dikhaai padataa he
 On seeing the first sight with a blank eye, the stars of this beam are obscure and interconnected and visible because of which it is colloquially called Kitchipichia
 dhyaan se dekhne par isamen chah taare pruthak pruthak dikhaai padate hai
 Hundreds of stars are seen in it from a telescope, in the midst of which a light mist of the nebula is also visible
 is tarapunj main 300 se 500 tak taare honge jo 50 prakashavarsh ke gole main bikhare hue hai
 The density of stars in the center is high
 chamkile taare bhi centre ke hi paas hai
 Kritika Tarapanja is about 500 light years away from Earth
 bhartiya jyotishshastra ke anusaar sattaaise nakshatron main teesraa nakshatra
 There are six stars in this constellation which appear to be combined with the shape of a fire pit
 krittika ko puranic anushrutiyon main daksh kii putree, chandramaa kii patni or kartikeya kii dhatri kaha gaya he
 The name Kartikeya is named after Kritika
 bhagwat puraana hinduon ke attharah puraanon main se ek he
 It is also called Shrimad Bhagavatam or simply Bhagavatam
 iskaa mukhya varnya vishay bhakthi yoga he, jisamen krishna ko sabhi devon kaa dev yaa swayan bhagwaan ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, devotion to Ras Bhava has also been represented in this Purana
 paramparaagat taur par is puraana kaa rachayita veda vyas ko mana jaataa he
 Shrimad Bhagwat is the crown jewel of Indian poetry
 bhagwaan shukdev dwaara maharaj parakshit ko sunaaya gaya bhaktimaarg to maano sopan hi he
 There is fragrance of Shri Krishna-love in each of its verses
 isamen saadhan-gyaan, siddhagyan, saadhan-bhakthi, siddha-bhakthi, maryaada-maarg, anugrah-maarg, dwait, advait samanvay ke saath preranadai vividh upakhyanon kaa adbhut sangrah he
 In the Ashtadash Puranas, Bhagwat is very important and famous Purana
 puraanon kii gananaa main bhagwat ashtum puraana ke rup main parigrihit kiya jaataa he 
 In the Bhagavata Purana, Maharishi Sut Goswami narrates a story to the sadhus presented to him
 sadhu log unase vishnu ke vibhinn avtaron ke bare main prashn poochhate hai
 Sut Goswami says that he had heard this story from another sage Shukdev
 isamen kul baarah sakandh hai
 All incarnations are described in summary form in the first episode
 aajkal 'bhagwat' akhya dhaaran karanevaale do puraana uplabdh hote hai : Therefore, in both these, whose calculation is required in the Purani category? a solution to this question is necessary
 vividh prakaar se samiksha karne par antat: yahi prathit hota he ki shrimadbhagwat ko hi puraana maananaa chahie tathaa devibhagwat ko uppurana kii koti main rakhana uchit he
 There is silence about the form of Shrimad Bhagwat Devi Bhagwat
 parantu devibhagwat 'bhagwat' kii gananaa uppuraanon ke antargat karata he tathaa apane aapako puraanon ke antargat
 The Bhuvanakosh mentioned in the Devi Bhagpanpancham wing literally follows the subject presented in the fifth wing of Srimad Bhagwat
 shribhagwat main bharatvarsh kii mahima ke pratipadak aathon shloke devi bhagwat main aksharsh: usee kram main uddhrut hai 
 The difference in the descriptions of the two is so much that where the Srimad Bhagavat takes a natural medium of prose for the sake of the description of the subject, Devi Bhagwat uses the artificial medium of the verse to demonstrate the uniqueness
 shrimadbhagwat bhakthiras tathaa aadhyatmagyaan kaa samanvay upasthit karata he
 The Bhagavata is considered to be the self-sufficiency of Nigamakalpataru, which has been made amritamay by the natural brahmachari and the great scientist Maharishi Shuk, combined with his melodious speech
 swayan bhagwat main kaha gaya he- 'vidyavatam Bhagwate Examination': Bhagwat is the test of scholarship and for this reason it is also incomparable in terms of commentary
 vibhinn vaishnav sampradaay ke vidwaanon ne apane vishisht mat kii upapatti tathaa paripushti ke nimitt bhagwat ke upar swasiddhantanuai vyakhyaaon kaa pranayan kiya he jinamein kuch tikaakaron kaa yahan sankshipt sanket kiya ja rahaa he: The exact decision of Bhagwat's country has not yet been made
 ekadash skandh main kaveri, tamraparni, kritamala aadi dravidadeshiy nadiyon ke jal pinevaale vyaktiyon ko bhagavan vasudev kaa amalashay bhakt batalaaya gaya he
 It is considered by scholars to be a clear indication of the Alavar of the Tamil country
 bhagwat main dakshin desh ke vaishnav tirthon, nadiyon tathaa parvaton ke vishisht sanket hone se katipay vidvan tamildesh ko iske udai kaa sthaan maanate hai
 There is a substantial difference in the subject of time also
 itnaa nishchit he ki bopadev, mahadev tathaa raja ramchandra ke karnadhipati tathaa mantri, prakhyat dharamshastri hemaadri ne apane 'chaturvarg chintamani' main bhagwat ke anek vachan udhrut kiye hai, bhagwat ke rachayita nahin maane ja sakate
 Shankaracharya's grandfather Guru Gaudapadacharya has quoted two verses of Bhagavat in his 'panchakaranavyakhya', 'jagruhe Paurusam Rupam' and 'shrey: Srutiin Bhakti Mudasya te Vibho' in 'uttaragita Tika'
 isse bhagwat kii rachana saptam shatee se arvachin nahin maani ja sakati
 The following table gives the composition of Bhagavata Purana suggested by some scholars- bhagwat kaa prabhaav madhyayugiya vaishnav sampradaayon ke udai main nitant kriyasheel tha tathaa bharat kii prantiy bhashaaon ke krishna kaavyon ke utthan main vishesh mahatvashaalee tha
 Ashtaghapi, Nimbarki, Radhavallabhi poets of Braj Bhasha took radiance and inspiration from Bhagwat, singing Radha Krishna's leelas in Brajbhasha
 mithila ke vidyapati, bengal ke chandidas, gyaandas tathaa govinddas, assam ke shankardev tathaa madhavdev, utkal ke upendra bhanj tathaa dinkrishnadas, maharashtra ke namdev tathaa madhav pandit, gujarat ke narsi mehta tathaa rajasthan kii mirabai - in sabhi santon tathaa kaviyon ne bhagwat ke rasmay varnan se prerana praapt kar radhakrishna kii kamaneey keli kaa gayan apane vibhinn kaavyon main kiya he
 The influence of Bhagwat on the Vaishnava poets of Tamil, Andhra, Kannada and Malayalam is also less
 bhagwat kaa aadhyatmik drushtikon advaitvaad kaa he tathaa sadhanadrushti bhakthi kii he
 Thus the symmetry of devotion with Advaita is Bhagavata's own peculiarity
 inhen kaarnon se bhagwat valmikiy ramayana tathaa mahabharat ke saath sanskrit kii 'upjivy' kavyatrayee ke antarbhoot mana jaataa he
 Bhagwat has 18 thousand verses, 335 chapters and 12 wings
 iske vibhinn skandhon main vishnu ke leelavataron kaa varnan badi sukumaar bhashaa main kiya gaya he
 But the tenth Skandha is the heart of Bhagwat, giving a detailed account of the fine pastimes of Lord Krishna
 anya puraanon main, jaise vishnupurana, brahmavaivart aadi main bhi krishna kaa charit nibaddh he, parantu dasham skandh main lilapurushottam kaa charit jitani madhur bhashaa, komal padvinyas tathaa bhakthiras se aplut hokar varnit he vah adwitiya he
 Raspanchadhyayi spirituality and literature is a unique object in poetry from a different perspective
 venugit, gopigit,, yugalageet, bhramaragit ne bhagwat ko kavy ke udaatt str par pahunchaa diya he
 Following are the 12 skandas of Bhagwat - bhagwat puraana kaa ek prishth Childhood of lord krishna shrimati madurai shanmukhvadivu subbulakshmi karnataka sangeet kii mashhoor sangeetkaar thim
 You are in the world of classical music Was known by letters
 shrimati subbulakshmi kaa janm 16 sitambar 1916 ko tamilnadu ke madurai shahar main hua
 Aap started teaching music at a young age and recorded his first disc at the age of ten

 The film was made in Tamil and Hindi and you sang many famous Meera Bhajans in it
 anek mashhoor sangeetkaaron ne shrimati subbulakshmi kii kala kii taareef kii he
 Lata Mangeshkar called you 'tapaswini', Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan called you 'susvaralakshmi', and Kishori Amonkar called you 'eighth Sur', which is higher than the seven notes of music
 bharat ke kai mananeey netaa, jaise mahatma gandhi or pandit nehru bhi aapke sangeet ke prashansak the
 On one occasion, Mahatma Gandhi said that even if Mrs
 Subbulakshmi 'hari, Tum Haro Jan Ki Bhir' can speak this Meera Bhajan instead of singing, she will still find that hymn more beautiful than anyone else's song

 Adding the suffix 'a' to the 'vad' metal has its changed form in the expressive noun 'vad' which means 'action to say' or 'said thing'
 'vaad' main 'anu' upsarg upsarg jodakar 'anuwaad' shabd bana he, jiskaa arth he, praapt kathan ko punah kahana
 It was first used by Monier Williams as a synonym for the English word translation
 iske baad hi 'anuwaad' shabd kaa prayog ek bhashaa main kisi ke dwaara prastut kii gai saamagree kii duusari bhashaa main punah prastuti ke sandarbh main kiya gaya
 In fact, translation is the best way to identify the rainbow form of language
 anuwaad kii anivaaryta ko kisi bhashaa kii samruddhi kaa shor machaa kar taala nahin ja saktaa or na anuwaad kii bahukoniya upyogita se inkaar kiya ja saktaa he

 The accepted meaning of the word 'translation' as a synonym of JPV is to reach the idea content of one language to another language
 anuwaad ke liye hindi main 'ultha' kaa prachlan bhi he
 Along with TRANSLATION in English, there is also the practice of TRANSCRIPTION, which is called 'transliteration' in Hindi
 anuwaad or lipyantaran kaa antar is udhaaharan se spasht he- It is clear from this that the Hindi translation in 'translation' is presented in English, whereas in transliteration the thing written in the Nagari script is kept only in the Roman script
 anuwaad ke liye 'bhashaantar' or 'roopaantar' kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa rahaa he
 But now new meanings and uses of both these words are prevalent
 'bhashaantar' or 'roopaantar' kaa prayog angreji ke INTERPRETATION shabd ke paryaay-swaroop hota he, jiskaa arth he do vyaktiyon ke bich bhashik sampark sthapit karnaa
 The linguistic distance between a Kannada-speaking person and an Assamese-speaking person is overcome by interpretation
 'roopaantar' shabd in dinon praayah kisi ek vidha kii rachana kii anya vidha main prastuti ke liye prayukt he
 Like, Premchand's novel 'godan' has been adapted into a drama 'hori'
 kisi bhashaa main abhivyakt vichaaron ko duusari bhashaa main yathavat prastut karnaa anuwaad he
 In this particular sense, the meaning of the word 'translation' is sure
 jis bhashaa se anuwaad kiya jaataa he, vah mulbhasha yaa strotbhasha he
 The new language to be translated from it is 'presented language' or 'target language'
 is tarah, strot bhashaa main prastut bhav yaa vichaar ko bina kisi parivartan ke lakshyabhasha main prastut karnaa hi anuwaad he
 j ek acha anuvadak vah he jo- Translation is considered an exceptionally difficult and ad hoc task
 yah ek jatil, kritrim, aavashyaktaa-janit, or ek drushti se sarjanaatmak prakriya he jisamen asaadhaaran or vishisht koti kii pratibha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is its own nature
 parantu mana jaataa he ki moulik lekhan na hone ke kaaran anuwaad ko sammaan kaa sthaan nahin miltaa he
 Because it is calculated that translation is difficult because it is not original writing - it is necessary to reiterate what was said earlier, in which it is necessary to follow many controls and restrictions
 is prakaar amaulik hone ke kaaran anuwaad kaa mahatva to kam ho gaya, parantu isi kaaran iske liye apekshit niyantranon or bandhanon ko mahatvapurn nahin samajha gaya
 The ideas of creative writers have often been discussed in this regard
 kuch vichaar is prakaar hai : The entire translation work is only an attempt to find a solution to an irreparable problem
 kisi kriti kaa anuwaad uske dosha ko badha detaa he or uske gunon ko vidrup kar detaa he
 Translations can never be successful as a genre of art
 anuvadak vanchak hote hai
 The circumstances behind the emergence of such ideas and the beliefs inspired by them are considered
 pehle anuwaad saamagree kaa bahulansh saahitiyik rachanaayen hoti thim, jinka anuwaad rachanaaon kii saahitiyik prakruti kii simaaon ke kaaran pathak kii aashaa ke anuroop nahin ho paata tha
 At the same time, it was also believed that the translation of each part of the language of the composition is required, so that no part of the original sensation is removed, and because it is not possible, the translation was placed in the category of discourse
 yah sthiti sthool rup se unnisvin shatabdi ke purvardh tak rahi jisamen anuwaad mukhya rup se vyaktigat ruchi se prerit adhik tha, saamaajik aavashyaktaa se prerit kam
 Apart from this, this type of opinion was also formed due to the quantum abundance of original writing
 duusare vishwayuddh ke pashchaat samrajyavad ke khandit hone ke falswaroop anek chote-bade raashtra swatantra hue tathaa unki asmita kaa prashn mahatvapurn ho gaya
 The constituents of the federal republics also began to become aware of their identity
 is sampark-sthapana tathaa asmita-vikaas kii sthiti main bhashaa kaa kendriya sthaan he, jo bahubhashikta kii sthiti ke rup main dikhaai padataa he
 The power of translation is inevitable in this
 iske falswaroop anuwaad pradhan rup se ek saamaajik aavashyaktaa ban gaya he
 a variety of writings began to be translated
 anuwaad kaary ek vyavsaay ho gaya
 Agencies to train translators were established, in which short-term and full-time courses and workshops etc
 were organized
 iskaa yah bhi parinaam hua ki ek or to anuwaad ke prati saamaajik drushtikon badla tathaa duusari ore gyanatmak drushti se anuwaad siddhanth ke vikaas ko vishesh bal mila tathaa anuwaad prashikshan paathyakramon ke liye anuwaad siddhanth kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar kiya gaya
 As a result, the translation theory became a relatively independent enlightenment, accessible to all three, including translator, translation teacher, and translation critic
 anuwaad ke vishay main saiddhanthik charchaa kaa sutarapaat aadhunik yug main hi hua, aisa samajhnaa tathy or tark donon ke hi vipareet mana jane laga
 Given the long tradition of translation work, it became logical to assume that the tradition of theoretical discussion about translation work is also old
 isa purv pehali shatabdi main siciro ke lekhan main anuwaad chintan ke beej praapt hote hai or tatpashchaat bhi is vishay par vidvan apane vichaar prakat karte rahe hai
 The background of this thought has also been there, though it is not clearly defined
 yah avashya mana gaya ki jis prakaar anuwaad kaary kaa sangathit rup main hona aadhunik yug kii dein he, usee prakaar anuwaad siddhanth kii apekshaakrit suparibhaashit prishthbhumi kaa viksit hona bhi aadhunik yug kii dein he
 The main feature of the modern context of translation theory is its multilateralism
 yah kisi ekanvit prishthbhumi par aadhaarit na hokar anek parantu paraspar sambaddh shastron kii samanvit prishthbhumi par aadhaarit he, jinke prasangochit anshon se vah prishthbhumi nirmit he
 The main scriptures are text science, communication theory, language use theory, and comparative applied linguistics
 yah spasht karnaa bhi uchit hoga ki ek ore maanav anuwaad tathaa yantrik anuwaad, tathaa duusari ore likhit anuwaad or maukhik anuwaad ke vyaavhaarik mahatva ke kaaran inke saiddhanthik paksh ke vishay main bhi chintan armbh hone laga he
 However, the translation of humanized written medium has been considered to be of quantitative and qualitative precedence and the issues of theoretical thinking related to them are particularly relevant
 yadhyapi pracheen bhartiya parampara main anuwaad chintan kii parampara utane vyavasthit tathaa lekhabaddh rup main praapt nahin hoti, jis prakaar pashchim main, tathaapi anuwaad chintan ke beej avashya uplabdh hai
 Accordingly, translation is repetition - re-telling a message expressed in one language to another
 anuwaad ke prati yah drushti pashchimi parampara main sweekrut dharna se bahya str par hi bhinn prathit hoti he
 But by adopting this vision, many theoretical points related to translation have been given more vivid and relevant interpretation
 isi sambandh main duusari drushti dwandvatmakataa kii he
 Which is modern and mainly the result of structuralism
 anuwaad kaary kii parampara ko dekhne se yah spasht he ki anawaad siddhanth sambandhi chintan saahitiyik kritiyon ko lekar hi adhik hua he
 This situation is also true
 vigat yug main saahitiyik kritiyon ko hi anuwaad ke liye chunaa jaataa tha
 Even now translations of literary works are more frequent
 tathaapi, paristhitiyon ke anurodh se ab saahityetar lekhan kaa anuwaad bhi adhik maatra main hone laga he
 The special thing is that there is a fundamental difference between the writings of the two categories
 jise lekhak kii vyaktinishthata tathaa nirvaiyaktikta kii shabdaawalee main adhik spasht reeti se prakat kar sakate hai
 Subjective writing, by virtue of its nature, has its own context
 yah kahkar ham donon kii ubhaynishth prishthbhumi kaa nishedh nahin kar rahe, parantu prastut sandarbh main ham donon kii duuri or aapekshik swaittata ko vishesh rup se ubhaarna chaahate hai
 It is only appropriate that the theoretical context of translation of non-personal writings from the side of linguistics be particularly highlighted
 anuwaad siddhanth kaa ek vikasman aayam he anusandhan kii pravriti
 Due to the multidisciplinary nature of translation theory, experts in various fields - philologist, sociologist, psychologist, academician, anthropologist, information theory expert - began to take interest in research work on the theoretical parts of translation with mutual cooperation
 anuwaad kaary kaa kshetra badhata gaya
 Connections between people of different cultures increased - people went abroad for education, business-industrial organizations worked in different countries, people of different languages sat together in conferences and exchanged, diplomatic agreements started between nations
 in sabhi main anuwaad kii anivaary rup se aavashyaktaa prathit hui or anuwaad kii vishisht samasyaayen ubharne lagi
 The study of these problems became a fertile field of research related to translation
 ek ore bhashaa or samskruti tathaa duusari ore bhashaa or vichaar ke madhya sambandh par anuwaad dwaara prastut sakshya ke aadhaar par nayaa chintan saamne aayaa
 New possibilities began to emerge in the areas of machine translation and oral translation, which gave impetus to translation research in these areas
 maanav anuwaad tathaa likhit anuwaad ke paramparaagat kshetron par bhi bhashaa adhyayan kii nai drushtiyon ne visheshgyon ko nutan paddati se vichaar karne ke liye prerit kiya
 From all these trends, the theory of Anavad started getting the status of prestige and it started getting acceptance as an appropriate field of theoretical research

 The legend of Babel's tower is famous, which points to the fact that, many languages are spoken in human society

 Prachara translations from Greek to Latin and Arabic to European languages are believed to be the result of this trend
 anuwaad kaary ko itihaas kii pravritiyon kii drushti se do bhaagon main vibhajit kija jaataa he - pracheen or aadhunik
 Translations of three types of compositions are mainly received in the ancient era
 kyonki in teen kshetron main hi praayah granthon kii rachana hoti thi
 These fields are - literature, philosophy and religion
 saahitiyik rachanaaon main greek ke elliod or odesi, sanskrit ke ramayana or mahabharat aise granth hai, jinka vyapak str anuwaad hua
 Plato's dialogues in philosophical works became popular from the point of view of translation
 dharmik rachanaaon main bible ke sabase adhik anuwaad paae jate hai
 Through the translation of modern era, these great texts of ancient era are now available to different languages
 anuwaad takanic kii drushti se in anuwaadon kii visheshta yah he ki, pracheen yug main ye anuwaad vishesh rup se ekapaksheeya rup main hote the arthath jis bhashaa main anuwaad kiye jate the unase unki kisi rachana kaa mul granth bhashaa main anuwaad nahin hota tha
 The reason for this is that the texts of the target language were often not as excellent as compared to the original texts, secondly, it was considered inappropriate to use as the target language due to the high regard for the language of the original texts
 aadhunik yug main anuwaad kaa kshetra vistrut ho gaya he
 The texts and compositions of the above mentioned three areas of science, technology, medicine, administration, diplomacy, law, public relations and many other areas have also come into being
 pracheen yug ke anuwaadon kii tulana main aadhunik yug ke anuwaad dwipaksheeya rup main hote hai
 The economic and political importance of translation has also become prestigious in the modern era
 vibhinn rashtron ke madhya raajnneetik, aarthik or saanskrithik anubandhon ke prapatr ke dwibhashik paath taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Multinational institutions have to use more than one language
 sanyukt raashtra main prayek kaary paanch yaa chah bhashaaon main kiya jaataa he
 All of this essentially requires translation
 is sthiti kaa auchity bhi he
 As a result of the industrial, technological, economic and political revolution in the modern era, the consciousness of the need for close contact with each other in the nations of the world has developed very quickly, due to which translation is considered natural to get this importance
 yahi kaaran he ki yadi pracheen yug kii prerak shakti anuvadak kii vyaktigat ruchi adhik thi, to aadhunik yug main anuwaad kii saamaajik-aarthik-raajnneetik aavashyaktaa ek prabal prerak shakti banakar saamne ai he
 There are many examples of this situation
 bhashaayi alpsankhyak varg ke lekhakon kii rachanaayen duusari bhashaaon main anudit hokar adhik padhi jaati hai
 Relatively small and multi-lingual nations face the problem of establishing contacts between different linguistic communities within their own country
 saamaajik aavashyaktaa ke anuroop anuwaad ke is mahatva ke kaaran anuwaad kaary ab sangathit rup se hota dekha jaataa he
 To meet the needs arising due to political-economic reasons, translation has now become a business and as a personal being, its organizational form also seems to be distinguished
 anuwaad kaushal ko sikhaane ke liye shiksha sansthaaon main prabandh kiye jate hai tathaa swatantra rup se bhi prashikshan santhaan kaam karte hai
 Translation as a distinct type of linguistic trade, from the Indian tradition point of view, is not new
 vastutah 'anuwaad' shabd or usase uplakshith bhashik vyapaar bhartiya parampara main bahut pehle se chale aae hai
 Therefore, with the help of the etymological and prophetic meanings of the word 'translation' and its English synonym 'translation', the definition and form of translation can be better known
 'anuwaad' kaa vyutpattimulak arth he - punah kathan; ek baar kahi hui baat ko dobaaraa kahana
 It consists of repetition of meaning, not of word
 'transleshan' shabd kaa vyutpattimulak arth he 'parvahan' arthath ek sthaan-bindu se duusare sthaan-bindu par le janaa
 This is a place-point language text
 isamen bhi le jaai jane vaali vastu arth hota he, shabd nahin
 The difference in both the above words is in terms of etymological meaning, hence superficial
 vaastavik vyavhaar main donon kii samanta spasht he
 The repetition of meaning is called in other words and by interpretation, the interpretation of meaning, in which the morphological-constitutive features of the original language are sometimes transposed into the target language
 vastutah 'anuwaad' shabd kaa bhartiya parampara vaala arth aadhunik sandarbh main bhi maanya he or isi ko kendra bindu banaakar anuwaad kii prakruti ko anshashah samajha jaataa he
 Accordingly, there are three references to translation work - bilingual, dialectical and intertextual
 sambhashik sandarbh main arth kii punrariti ek hi bhashaa kii seemaa ke antargat hoti he, parantu iske aayam bhinn-bhinn ho jate hai
 The main dimensions are two - chronological and synchronous
 kalkramik aayam par sambhashik anuwaad ek hi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kii do nearesth avasthaaon main hota he, jaise, puraani hindi se aadhunik hindi main anuwaad
 Synchronous translation on the synchronous dimension mainly takes place at three levels - dialect, style and medium
 boli str par sambhashik anuwaad ke chaar upstar ho sakate hai : From one geographical dialect to another geographical dialect; Like in Braj to Awadhi
 amanak boli se maanak boli main; jaise ganjam oriya se puri kii oriya main athwa nagpur marathi se pune marathi main
 Dialectively in language form, like Braj or Awadhi to Hindi ek saamaajik boli se duusari saamaajik boli main, jaise ashikshiton yaa alpashikshiton kii bhashaa se shikshiton kii bhashaa main yaa ek dharm main dikshit logon kii bhashaa se anya dharm main dikshit logon kii bhashaa main
 At the genre level, bilingual translation can also be seen as genre-substitute
 iskaa ek acha udhaaharan he aupchaarik style se anaupchaarik style main anuwaad; jaise ‘dhumrapaan varjit he' → ‘bidi cigarette pinaa manaa he' 
 Similarly, there is no symmetry in 'tubular air transfusion'
 he' -> 'tair kii hawa nikal gai he' 
 From the point of view of medium, there is a situation of linguistic translation where the message presented in the oral medium is repeated in the written medium or vice versa; For example, there is a sentence in the oral medium: "due to the time limit, i will not be able to tell my listeners about this in more detail
 " isi ko likhit madhyam main is prakaar se kahana sambhavtah uchit mana jaataa he : "sthaan kii seemaa ke kaaran main apane pathakon ko adhik vistaar se is vishay kaa spashtikaran nahin kar sakunga
 "
 sambhashik anuwaad ke uparyukt udaahranon se do baaten spasht hoti hai
 In the process of semantics or repetition of meaning, both words and syntax are affected
 madhyam anuwaad main svanaprakriya kii visheshtaayen likhit vyavastha kii visheshtaon kaa rup le leti hai yaa iske vipareet hota he
 There is not a rigid dividing line between the dimensions of dialect, style, and medium, but only partial overlap is found in them, the possibility of which lies in the tendency to use language
 jaise, shailigat anuwaad kii aanshik satta madhyam anuwaad main dikhaai detii he, or tadnusaar 'ke vishay main bataa paanaa' jaisaa maukhik madhyam kaa, at ev anaupchaarik, chayan, likhit madhyam main aupchaarikta kaa sparsh letaa hua 'kaa spashtikaran kar sakna' ho jaataa he
 Similarly, in stylistic translation, social spoken translation is also sometimes included
 jaise, shikshiton kii boli main, aupchaarik style kii pradhanta kii pravriti ho sakati he or alpashikshiton yaa ashikshiton kii boli main anaupchaarik style kii
 Problems of bilingual translation are not only interesting but also important in terms of other bilingual translation
 anuwaad ko bhashaprayog kii ek vidha ke rup main dekhne par sambhashik anuwaad kaa mahatva or bhi spasht ho jaataa he
 Apart from this, understanding the nature of bilingual translation is not only helpful, but also necessary in terms of understanding the nature of other bilingual translation
 ye kaha ja saktaa he ki anuwaad vyutpann bhashaprayog he, jiske do sandarbh hai - sambhashik or anybhashik
 In this context, there is a difference in translation behavior, but in both cases the nature of translation remains the same
 anybhashik anuwaad do bhashaaon ke bich main hota he
 These two languages are recognized as independent languages on a coordinated criterion of historicity and regionality
 aitihaasik drushti se ek hi dhara main aane vaali bhashaaon ko saamanytah us sthiti main swatantra bhashaa ke rup main dekhte hai yadi vah kalkram main ek duusare ke nikat sannihit na hon, jaise sanskrit or hindi; in donon ke madhya praakrit bhashaayen aa jaati hai
 Likewise, in terms of regionalism, even if they are highly respected in the Adivasi languages, they will have to consider different languages, such as Hindi and Punjabi
 anybhashik anuwaad ke sandarbh main sambandhit bhashaaon kaa swatantra astitv mahatva kii baat hoti he
 Other bilingual translation is more important socially and practically than the linguistic translation
 bhashaprayog kii drushti se anybhashik anuwaad kii samasyaon main sambhashik anuwaad kii samasyaon se gunatmak antar dikhaai padataa he
 Thus, despite relating to bilingual translation, other bilingual translation is relatively self-contained business
 anuwaad shabd ke uparyukt donon sandarbh apekshaakrit simit hai
 In these, translation has been considered as the trade of languages
 vastutah bhashaa-sanket, sanketon kii ek vishisht shrenee he, jinke dwaara sampreshan kaary sampann hota he
 Signs of different categories are used for communication
 inhen saamaanya sanket kaha jaataa he
 From this point of view, the word translation is also defined
 iske anusaar ek sanketon dwaara kahi gai baat ko dusri koti ke sanketon dwaara punah kahana is prakaar ke anuwaad ko antarasanketaparak anuwaad kaha jaataa he
 It is under general signology
 bhashik sanketon ko pravartan bindu maanakar sanketon ko bhashik or bhashetar main vibhakt kiya jaataa he
 There are two parts in Bhashaatar - external and internal
 anuwaad kii drushti se sanket-parivartan ke vyapaar kii nimnlikhit kotiyaan ban sakati hai : 1
 Translation of external signs into external signs - Accordingly, a map of a country is a translation of that country; a picture of a creature is a translation of that creature
 2
 bahya sanket kaa bhashik sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi praani ke liye kisi bhashaa main prayukt koi shabd us praani kaa anuwaad he
 From this point of view, this is really the problem of language philosophy, which has been interpreted in the hint theory of meaning
 3
 aantarik sanket se aantarik sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi ek ghatana ko uski samshil samvednaa main parivartit karnaa is shrenee kaa anuwaad he
 It is clear that this situation cannot be the real authority
 atah keval saiddhanthikta kii dashti se hi yah koti nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 4
 Translation from internal signs to linguistic signs - According to this, the use of a word for any internal sensation is a translation of this category
 isko adhik spashtataa se kaha jaataa he ki, kisi bhautik sthiti ke saath sampark hone par - jaise, kisi durghatana ko dekhakar, prakruti ke kisi drishy ko dekhakar, kisi vastu ko haath lagaakar, kuch sanghakar; duusare shabdon main indriyaarth sannikarsh hone par - man main jis samvednaa kaa udai hota he vah ek prakaar kaa sanket he
 For him, using any language word or repeating it with linguistic signs will be called translation of this category
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vishisht prakaar kii vednaa kaa sanket karne ke liye hindi main ‘shok' shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or duusari ke liye 'prem' kaa
 One sensation is believed to be translated by the word 'mourning' and the other by 'love'
 is drushti se yah kaha jaataa he ki samast moulik abhivyakti anuwaad he
 The speaker or writer repeats their sensory signals into linguistic signs
 is drushti se yah bhashaa manovigyaan kii samasya he, jisaki vyakhya uddipan-anukriya siddhanth main kii gai he
 Thus, translations have the place of translations of all three references in the wider range of the word - linguistic translation, linguistic translation, and intertextual translation
 teenon kaa apana-apana saiddhanthik aadhaar he
 It is important to know the difference between these three
 anuvadak ko yah sthir karnaa he ki in teenon main kendriya sthiti kiski he tathaa shesh do kaa unke saath kaisaa sambandh he
 From the point of view of theoretical justification, the position of dialectical translation is central
 keval ‘anuwaad' shabd se anybhashik anuwaad kaa arth grahan kiya jaataa he
 Its root is bilingualism
 anuvadak kaa bodhan tathaa abhivyakti donon sthitiyon main hi bhashaa se bandhe rahete hai or ye bhashaayen bhi bhed kii drushti se nahin, api tu code kii drushti se bhinn-bhinn hoti hai; jaise hindi or angreji, hindi or sindhi aadi
 This central position has two ends
 pratham chor par donon sthitiyon main bhashabaddhata rahati he, parantu bhashaa vahi rahati he
 The difference of positions is based on the difference of differences in the same language
 yah sambhashik anuwaad he
 For clarity of the use of technical terms, it is called 'exploration' or 'translation'
 doosar chor par bhashetar sanket kaa bhashik sanket main parivartan hota he
 This change of signaling method leads to the normal state of language use
 paribhaashik shabdaawalee main ise 'bhashaa vyavhaar' kaha jaataa he
 These three have both relation and difference
 yah sambandh ubhaynishth he
 The important thing from the translation point of view is that translators are helped by concepts of bilingual translation and intertextual translation in the actual translation work and in the evaluation of translated text
 yah aavashyaktaa tabhi mukhar rup se saamne aati he, jab anuwaad karte-karte anuvadak kabhi atak jate hai -mul paath kaa samyak bodhan nahin ho paaten, lakshyabhasha main shuddh or upyukt anuwaad kaa paryaaptatya anveshan karne main kathinaayee hoti he, anuvadak ko yah jaanchna hota he ki anuwaad kitna safal he, ityadi
 In the parlance, the word 'translation' refers to the dialectical translation
 or isi kaaran shaniah shaniah yah baat siddhanth kaa bhi ang ban gai he ki anuwaad do bhashaaon ke madhya hone vaali prakriya he
 This condition is accepted
 sanskrit parampara kaa 'chaaya' shabd isi sthiti kaa sanket karne ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he
 The definition of translation is particularly helpful for understanding the nature of translation
 anuwaad kii bahupaksheeyata ko dekhte hue anuwaad kii paribhaasha vibhinn drushtikonon se prastut kii gai he
 The main approaches are of three types - translation is a process
 anuwaad ek prakriya athwa / or uskaa parinaam he
 Translation is the name of a relation
 is drushtikon ke antargat nimnlikhit paribhaashaayen uddhrut kii jaati hai : "translation is the act of presenting the equivalent message in the target language
 sandeshon kii yah moolyasmata pehle arth or phir style kii drushti se, tathaa nikatatam evam swaabhaavik hoti he
 " "anuwaad vah prakriya he, jiske dwaara sarthak anubhav ek bhashaa-samudaay se duusare bhashaa-samudaay ko sampreshit kiya jaataa he
 " "ek bhashaa kii paathyasaamagree ko duusari bhashaa kii samanarthak paathyasaamagree dwaara prasthaapit karnaa anuwaad kehalaata he
 " "anuwaad ek shilp he jisamen ek bhashaa main likhit sandesh ke sthaan par duusari bhashaa ke usee sandesh ko prastut karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 " iske antargat nimna likhit paribhaasha ko uddhrut kiya jaataa he : "the process of transferring a product from one language or linguistic to another language or linguistic or its result is called translation
 " Under this comes the following definition: "anuwaad ek sambandh he, jo do yaa do se adhik paathon ke bich hota he; ye paath samaan sthiti main samaan prakaarya sampadit karte hai 
 " anuwaad kii paribhaashaon kaa yah vargeekaran jahaan anuwaad kii prakruti kii bahupaksheeyata ko spasht karata he, vahaan isse yah sanket bhi miltaa he ki, vibhinn uddeshyon ke anusaar anuwaad kii paribhaashaayen bhi bhinn-bhann ho sakati hai
 Thus all these definitions are valid
 in paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par anuwaad ke do paksh maane jate hai
 There are two sides to translation - first the operational side at the dynamic and the second theoretical aspect at the positional point
 sankriyaatmak drushti se anuwaad ek prakriya he
 The aspect of translation is related to the act of translation for which it is considered appropriate to use the word 'translation work'
 saiddhanthik drushti se anuwaad ek sambandh he jo do yaa do se adhik, parantu vibhinn bhashaaon ke paathon ke madhya hota he; parantu ve samanarthak hone chaiye
 This relationship is inaugurated by the study of comparative method
 in donon kaa samanvit rup is dharna main miltaa he ki anuwaad ek nishpatti he - kaary kaa parinaam anuwaad he - jo apane mul paath se paryaayta ke sambandh se judaa he
 The translation is called 'translated text' as a form of objection
 is drushti se ek mul paath ke anek anuwaad ho sakate hai
 In this way, where translation from an operational point of view is known as a mode of language use, in theoretical terms its relation is linked to the question of language relations based on techniques of language text comparison and contrast analysis
