 Nevertheless, Jack Homer, noting Gandhi's long correspondence with Jinnah about the subject of Pakistan, says- "although Gandhi was personally against partition, he suggested a consensus under which the Congress and the Muslim League would form the provisional government
" Get your freedom by compromising below, after which the question of partition will be decided by the opinion of the districts where the number of Muslims Is good "
 Keeping this dual position on the subject of partition of India, Gandhi opened up the dimensions of criticism from both Hindus and Muslims

 Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his associates condemned Gandhi and alleged that he is politically engaged in persuading Muslims and that he is negligent about the atrocities on Hindus and has approved the creation of Pakistan
 It is still politically controversial today, as pakistani-american historian Ayesha Jalal argues that Gandhi and the Congress were not willing to share power with the Muslim League because of the partition, for example Hindu nationalist politician Pravin Togadia also Criticizing the leadership about the subject, it also indicates that the extreme weakness of their part led to the partition of India

 Further in 1612, Kruska Academy published the first dictionary of the Italian language, which helped to stabilize the literary language form

 sidhu-kanhu, chaand-bhairo bhaaiyon or phoolo-jhaano judwa bahanon ne santhal hal kaa netritv, shaam tudu ke maargdarshan main kiya
 Increased persecution of the people due to the permanent settlement initiated by Lord Cornwallis in 1793 was a major reason for this rebellion
 unnisvin shatabdi ke praarambhik varshon main, bukanan ne rajmahal kii pahadiyon kaa daura kiya tha
 According to his description, these mountains looked impenetrable
 yah ek aisa khatarnaak ilaaka tha jahaan bahut kam yatri jane kii himmat karte the
 Wherever Buchanan went, he found the behavior of the residents hostile
 ve log company ke adhikariyon ke prati ashankit the or unase baatcheet karne ko taiyaar nahin the
 In many instances, they had left their homes and villages and fled
 ye pahari log koun the? ve bukanan ke daure ke prati itane ashankit kyon the? bukanan kii patrika main hamen unnisvin shatabdi ke praarambhik varshon main in logon kii jo taras khaane vaali haalat thi uski jhalak milti he
 He had written a diary about the places, places where he had visited, met people and observed their customs
 atharahavin shatabdi ke parvarti dashakon ke rajasav abhilekhon par drushtipaat karen to pataa lagata he ki in pahari logon ko 'pahadiya' kyon kaha jaataa tha
 They used to live around the palace hills
 ve jangal kii upaj se apni guzar-basar karte the or jhum kheti kiya karte the
 They used to clean the land by cutting bushes and burning weeds in a small part of the forest, and they grew from the potash of ashes ?? These hill people used to grow different types of pulses and jowar-millet for their food
 ve apane kudaal se jameen ko thodaa khurch lete the kuch varsho tak us saaf kii gai jameen main kheti karte the aarai fir use kuch varsho ke liye parati chhod kar nae ilaake main chale jate the jisase ki us jameen main khoi hui urvartaa fir se utpann ho jaati thi
 From those forests, Pahariyas used to gather flowers of Mahua for food, silk koya for sale and wood to make resin and Kathkoya
 pedo ke neeche jo chote-chote paudho ug aate the yaa parati jameen par jo ghaas-foos kii hari chadar-si bich jaati thi vah pashuon ke liye charaagaah ban jaati thi
 The lives of Pahariyas were closely associated with the forest as hunters, jhoom cultivators, food gatherers, kathakoya builders, silkworm rearers
 ve imali ke pedo ke bich bani apni jhopadiyon main rahete the or aam ke pedo kii chhaanh main aaraam karte the
 They considered the entire state as their private land and this land was the basis of their identity and life
 ve bahari logon ke pravesh kaa pratirodh karte the
 Their chiefs maintained unity in their group, settled mutual fighting and led their tribes when fighting with other tribes and plains
 in pahadiyon ko apana muladhar banaakar, pahadiya log baraabar un maidaanon par akraman karte rahete the jahaan kisaan ek sthaan par bas kar apni kheti-baadi kiya karte the
 These invasions by the hills were mostly done to keep themselves alive, especially in years of scarcity or famine
 saath hi, ye hamale maidaanon main based hue samudaayon par apni takat dikhalaane kaa bhi ek tarika tha
 Apart from this, such attacks were also done to build their political relations with outsiders
 maidaanon main rahane vaale jameendaaron ko akasar in pahari mukhiyaaon ko niyamit rup se kharad dekar unase shanti kharidni padati thi
 Similarly, merchant people also used to pay some toll to get permission to use the paths controlled by these hills
 jab aisa pathakar pahadiya mukhiyaaon ko mil jaataa tha to ve vyapaariyon kii raksha karte the or yah bhi aashwaasan dete the ki koi bhi unke maal ko nahin luutegaa
 Thus the peace treaty with some levies did not last long
 yah atharahavin shatabdi ke antim dashakon main us samay bhang ho gai jab sthir kheti ke kshetra kii seemayen aakraamak reeti se purvi bharat main badhaai jane lageen
 The British encouraged the felling of forests and the zamindars and landlords converted the fallow land into paddy fields
 angrejon ke liye sthaayee kashi kaa vistaar aavashyak tha kyonki usase rajasav ke sronton main vruddhi ho sakati thi, niryaat ke liye fasal paidaa ho sakati thi or ek sthaayee, suvyavasthit samaaj kii sthapana ho sakati thi
 They considered the forests to be desolate and considered the forest dwellers uncivilized, barbaric, rowdy and cruel over whom it was difficult to govern them
 isliye unhone yahi mahasoos kiya ki jangalon kaa safaaya karke, vahaan sthaayee kashi sthapit kerani hogi or junglee logon ko paaltu va sabhy bananaa hoga unase shikaar kaa kaam chhudvaana hoga or kheti kaa dhandha apnaane ke liye unhen raji karnaa hoga
 As permanent agriculture expanded, the area of forests and pastures became narrower
 isse pahari logon tathaa sthaayee khetiharon ke bich jhagada tej ho gaya
 The hill people started attacking the villages inhabited more regularly and snatched food grains and animals from the villagers
 aupniveshik adhikariyon ne uttejit hokar in pahadiyon par kaabo kii bharsak koshishen kin parantu unke liye aisa karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 In the 1770s, the British authorities adopted a brutal policy of clearing these hills and hunting and killing them
 tadoparaant, 1780 ke dashak main bhagalpur ke colector augustus cleveland ne shanti sthapana kii niti prastaavit kii jiske anusaar pahadiya mukhiyaaon ko ek vaarshik bhatta diya janaa tha or badale main unhen apane aadamiyon kaa chaal-chalan thik rakhane kii jimmedaari leni thi
 They were also expected to maintain order in their settlements and discipline their people
 lekin bahut se pahadiya mukhiyaaon ne bhatta lene se manaa kar diya
 Most of those who accepted it lost their power in their community
 aupniveshik sarkaar ke vetanbhogi ban jane se unhen adhinsth karmchaaree yaa vaitanaik mukhiya mana jane laga
 While the campaigns for peace-making were going on, the Pahadias went to the inner parts of the mountains to protect themselves from hostile forces and to keep fighting with outsiders
 isliye jab 1810-11 kii sardiyon main bukanan ne is kshetra kii yatra kii thi to yah swaabhaavik hi tha ki pahadiya log bukanan ko andeh or avishvaas kii drushti se dekhte
 The experience of peacekeeping campaigns and the memories of brutal repression created a perception in his mind about the effect of infiltration of British people in his area, it seemed to him that every white man was representing such power
 Who are striving to destroy their life style and means of survival by snatching their forest and land from them
 vastut: inhen dinon unhen ek nae khatre kii suchnaayen milane lagi thim or vah tha santhal logon kaa aagaman
 Santhals were entering the area in large numbers, clearing the forests there, cutting timber, plowing land and growing rice and cotton
 chunki santhal bashindon ne nichali pahadiyon par apana kabja jamaa liya tha, isliye pahadiyon ko rajmahal kii pahadiyon main or bheetar kii ore peeche hatana padaa
 The Pahadia people used the hoe for their jhoom cultivation, so if the hoe is considered a symbol of Pahariya life, the plow has to be considered representative of the power of the new settlers
 hal or kudaal ke bich kii yah ladaai bahut lambii chali
 Towards the end of 1810, Buchanan crossed the Ganjuria mountain, a part of the Rajmahal ranges, and passed through the middle of the Chattani region to a village
 vaise to yah ek purana gaanv tha par uske aas-paas kii jameen kheti karne ke liye abhi-abhi saaf kii gai thi
 Seeing the land there, he came to know that the work of that area has been reversed 'with proper use of human labor'
 usne likhaa, ganjuriya main abhi-abhi kaafii jutai kii gai he jisase yah pataa chalata he ki ise kitne shandaar ilaake badla ja saktaa he main sochataa hoon, isaki sundarataa or samrudh vishwa ke kisi bhi kshetra jaisi viksit kii ja sakati he
 The land here is quite flat but very fine and Buchanan did not see such good tobacco and mustard anywhere else
 poochne par use pataa chalaa ki vahaan santhalon ne kashi kshetra kii seemayen kaafii badha lee thi
 They came to this area around 1800
 They drove the hill people living there on the lower slopes, wiped out the forests and then settled there
 santhal 1780 ke dashak ke aas-paas bengal main aane lage the
 The zamindars hired them to prepare new lands for farming and to expand farming and the British authorities invited them to settle in the jungle palaces
 jab british log pahadiyon ko apane bas main karke sthaayee kashi ke liye ek sthaan par basaane main asafal rahe to unka dhyaan santhalon kii ore gaya
 The Pahadia people were not ready to hand the plow to cut the forest and still behaved unruly
 jabaki, iske vipareet, santhal adarsh bascindia prathit hue, kyonki unhen jangalon kaa safaaya karne main koi hichak nahin thi or ve bhoomi ko puri takat lagaakar jotate the
 Santhals were given land and ready to settle in the foothills of the palace
 1832 tak, jameen ke ek kaafii bade ilaako ko damin-i-koh ke rup main simaankit kar diya gaya
 This was declared to be Santhal land
 unhen is ilaake ke bheetar rahanaa tha, hal chalaakar kheti kerani thi or sthaayee kisaan bananaa tha
 The grant letter of the land given to the Santhals had the condition that they had to be plowed within the first ten years by clearing at least one tenth of the land given to them
 is puure kshetra kaa surveykshan karke uskaa nakshaa taiyaar kiya gaya
 Its boundary was fixed by burying the pillars around it and it was separated from the world of the permanent peasants of the plains and from the hills of the Pahadia people
 damin-i-koh ke simakan ke baad, santhalon kii bastiyaan badi teji se badhin, santhalon ke gaanvon kii sankhya jo 1838 main 40 thi, teji se badhkar 1851 tak 1,473 tak pahunch gai
 In the same period, the population of Santhals which was only 3,000 increased to more than 82,000
 jaise-jaise kheti kaa vistaar hota gaya, vaise-vaise company kii tijoriyon main rajasav raashi main vruddhi hoti gai
 The long history of his travels is repeatedly mentioned in nineteenth-century Santhal songs and myths: he states that the Santhal people used to keep walking tirelessly in search of a place to settle for themselves
 ab yahan damin-i-koh main aakar maano unki is yatra ko purna viraam lag gaya
 When the Santhals settled on the palace hills, the hill people first resisted it, but eventually they were forced to move inward into these hills
 unhen nichali pahadiyon tathaa ghaatiyon main neeche kii ore aane se roak diya gaya or i pari pahadiyon ke chattani or adhik banjar ilaakon tathaa bhitari shushk bhaagon tak simit kar diya gaya
 This had a bad effect on their living and life and later they became poor
 jhum kheti nayi-se-nayi jaminen khojane or bhoomi kii practik urvartaa kaa upyog karne kii kshamta par nirbhar rahati he
 The most fertile lands now became scarce for them as they had now become part of Damin
 isliye pahadiya log kheti ke apane tareeke ;jhum kheti ko aage safaltaapurvak nahin chalaa sake
 Pahariya hunters also faced problems when the forests of the region were cleared for cultivation
 iske vipareet santhal logon ne apni pehle vaali khanbdosh zindagi ko chhod diya tha
 Now they had settled in one place and started cultivating many commercial crops for the market and dealing with merchants and moneylenders
 kintu, santhalon ne bhi jaldi hi yah samaj liya ki unhone jis bhoomi par kheti kerani shuru kii thi vah unke haathon se nikalati ja rahi he
 The government cleared the land on which the Santhals started farming; the state was levying a heavy tax, the moneylender; the Diku were charging a very high rate of interest and occupying the land only in the event of non-payment of loans
 And the zamindars were claiming their control over the Damin area
 1850 ke dashak tak, santhal log yah mahasoos karne lage the ki apane liye ek adarsh sansar kaa nirmaan karne ke liye, jahaan unka apana shashan ho, jameendaaron, sahukaaron or aupniveshik raaj ke viruddh vidroh karne kaa samay ab aa gaya he
 The Santhal Parganas were constructed after the Santhal Rebellion of 1855–56, for which an area of 5,500 sq mi was taken from the districts of Bhagalpur and Birbhum
 aupniveshik raaj ko aashaa thi ki santhalon ke liye nayaa pargana banane or usamen kuch vishesh kanoon lagu karne se santhal log santusht ho jaayenge
 He was an employee of the British East India Company
 uski yatraayen keval bhudrushyon ke pyaar or agyaat kii khoj se hi prerit nahin thim
 He used to travel everywhere with a large team of map navis, surveyors, porters who carried the sedan etc
 uski yatraaon kaa kharch east india company uthaati thi kyonki use un soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa thi jo bukanan pratyaashit rup se ikatthi karata tha
 Buchanan was given clear instructions as to what to see, search and write
 vah jab bhi apane logon kii fuj ke saath kisi gaanv main aata to use tatkaal sarkaar ke ek agent ke rup main hi dekha jaataa tha
 When the company consolidated its power and developed its business, it began to search for natural resources that it could capture and use as it wanted
 usne paridrishyon tathaa rajasav sronton kaa surveykshan kiya, khoj yatraayen yojit kin or jaankaree ikatthi karne ke liye apane bhuvigyaniyon, bhugolvettaon, vanaspati vigyaniyon or chikitsakon ko bheja
 Buchanan was undoubtedly one such person of extraordinary observation power
 bukanan jahaan kahin bhi gaya, vahaan usne pattharon tathaa chattaanon or vahaan kii bhoomi ke bhinn-bhinn staron tathaa paraton ko dhyanpurvak dekha
 He tried to find commercially valuable stones and minerals
 He traced all the places related to iron minerals and talc, granite and saltpeter
 usne saavdhaneepurvak namak banane or kaccha loha nikaalane kii sthaneey paddatiyon kaa nirikshan kiya
 When Buchanan used to write about a landscape, he often wrote not only what he had seen and how the landscape was, but also how he could make it more productive by manipulating it
 vahaan koun-si fasalen boi ja sakati hai, koun-se ped kaate ja sakate hai or koun-se ugaae ja sakate hai or hamen yah bhi yaad rakhana hoga ki uski sookshm drushti or praathamikataayen sthaneey nivaasiyon se bhinn hoti thim: kya aavashyak he is bare main uskaa akalan company ke vanijyik sarokaaron se or pragati ke sambandh main aadhunik paashchaatya vichaardhaara se nirdhaarit hota tha
 He was essentially a critic of the lifestyle of the forest dwellers and felt that forests would have to be converted into agricultural land
 majathi main bharat ke bihar rajya ke antargat magadh mandal ke aurangabad jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The Chagtai Khan was a turkish-mongol Khan that included areas in Central Asia ruled by Genghis Khan's second son Chagtai Khan and his descendants
 armbh main yah khaanat mongol samrajya kaa hissaa maani jaati thi lekin aage chalakar puri tarah swatantra ho gai
 At its peak it extended from the Aral Sea to the Amu Darya in the south to the Altai Mountains on the outskirts of modern China and Mongolia

 After the death of Mangu Khan, when the unity of the Mongol Empire was destroyed, Khaidu, the grandson of Ukdai Khan, established his power in Central Asia, and the Chagatai ruler Tua, who was a Muslim, ended the suzerainty of Khapsu's son Chapsu in 1305

 Soon his power was weakened due to his home struggles and after the death of Tiryashirin, his kingdom fell apart
 mahaan vijeta taimur ne vastut: is vansh ko hataa diya, yadhyapi usne or uske praarambhik uttaradhikariyon ne chagatai vanshajon ko apana khan banaae rakhaa
 But Tughlaq Timur established a new branch of the Chagatai rulers at Sikyang which kept his rule until the end of the 16th century
 babar kii maan, isi vansh kii rajakanya thi
 That is why the Mughals describe themselves as belonging to the Chagatai dynasty
