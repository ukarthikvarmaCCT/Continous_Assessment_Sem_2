 Bhaskaracharya discusses permutations in Lilavati's chapter titled 'akpash' At number of places which are filled with equal nymbers of digits, place 1, 2, 3, 4 


 in increasing order
 The product of these digits is the required number of permutations
 Similarly, In the given digits, if some digits are repeated, then at those number of places find number of permutations assuming different digits
 Divide by this number, the number of permutations of all given digits, assuming different digits at all places
 Similarly, Mahaviracharya has given the following formula for the total accumulation of some given items in the Mathematics collection
 in order below; the product in the reverse order is divided by the product in order; is the result
 It is noteworthy that several centuries later, in 1634 AD, exactly the same formula was given by Herrigon

 unhen theva pulvar, valluvar or poyamodi pulvar jaise anya naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Thiruvalluvar was born in Mylapore
 unki patni vasuki ek pavitra or samarpit mahila thi, ek aisi adarsh patni jisane kabhi bhi apane pati ke adeshon kii avagya nahin kii or unka shatshah paalan kiya
 Thiruvalluvar told people that a person can live a life of a householder or householder as well as a divine life or a pure and holy life
 unhone logon ko bataaya ki shuddh or pavitrataa se paripurna divya jivan jeene ke liye parivaar ko chhodkar sanyasi banane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 His knowledge and teachings now exist in the form of a book known as 'tirukkural'
 tamil calendar kii avadhi usee samay se he or use tiruvalluvar andu ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 The time of the existence of Thiruvalluvar is based mostly on linguistic evidence rather than archaeological evidence as no archaeological evidence has yet been determined
 unke kaal kaa anumaan 200 i

 The name Thiruvalluvar is derived from Tiru and Valluvar
 unke vaastavik naam ke bajaae valluvan naam ek saamaanya naam he jo unki jati / vyavsaay kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 However, the author of Therukural is named after his community or vice versa, the question remains unanswered till date
 tiruvalluvar ke janm ke bare main kuch kinvadantiyaan rahi hai
 Shaiva, Vaishnava, Jain, Buddhist sects argue that Thiruvalluvar belongs to them
 tiruvalluvar ke janm ke bare main kuch kinvadanti bhi rahi hai jisamen unhen ek jain samanaar sant yaa ek hindu kaha gaya he
 But there is no evidence available about his religion
 kamatchi shrinivasana "kural kuram samaym", tirukkural prakaashan, madurai kamraj vishvavidhyalay, 1979 | is kriti kaa armbh sarvashaktimaan bhagwaan ko sadar pranaam karte hue ek adhyay se hota he
 That is why it can be said that Thiruvalluvar was a believer
 lekin unke parameshwar sarvashaktimaan hai, saare sansar ke nirmaataa hai or jo apane bhakton kii raksha karte hai
 Actually, Kural does not advocate any specific or communal religious faith
 ek katha main unhen pandya shaskaon kii pracheen rajdhani madurai se joda jaataa he, jinhone tamil sahitya ko sakhti se badhaava kiya tha
 According to another, he was born and brought up in Mylapore, which is currently a part of the city of Madras and traveled to Madurai to collect his work Tirukkural so that he could get approval from the king and his group of poets
 
 His wife's name is Vasuki vahaan or bhi adhik paramparaagat kahaniyaan hai jisamen kaha gaya he ki madurai kaa tamil sangam vah praadhikaran tha jiske madhyam se tirukkural ko vishwa ke saamne pesh kiya gaya
 Thiruvalluvar may have spent most of his life in Madurai as it was under the Pandia rulers where many Tamil poets progressed
 Recently, the Kanyakumari Center for Historical and Cultural Research claimed that Valluvar was a king who ruled Valluvanadu, a mountainous area in Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu

 ho saktaa he graul ne jainiyon ko bhi baudhon ke antargat sammilit kiya 
 Jain scholars and many historians believe that Thiruvalluvar was a Jain monk, as the first chapter of Tirukkural is dedicated to Rishabhdev, the first Tirthankara of Jainism

 Kural has probably been translated into most languages after the Bible, Quran, and Gita
