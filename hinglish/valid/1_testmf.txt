saint paul palli, antigua or barbuda kii ek palli he
 Its capital is Falmouth City
 darshanashastra vah gyaan he jo param satya or prakruti ke siddhanton or unke kaarnon kii vivechna karata he
 Philosophy is an approach to test reality
 darshanik chintan multah jivan kii arthvatta kii khoj kaa paryaay he
 In fact, philosophy is the science of self, that is, nature and society, and the general rules of the process of human thought and cognition
 darshanashastra saamaajik chetana ke roopon main se ek he
 Philosophy is the name of the discipline that seeks truth and knowledge
 vyapak arth main darshan, tarkpurna, vidhipurvak evam krambaddh vichaar kii kala he
 It is born according to experience and situation
 yahi kaaran he ki sansar ke bhinn-bhinn vyaktiyon ne samay-samay par apane-apane anubhavon evam paristhitiyon ke anusaar bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke jivan-darshan ko apanaaya
 The history of Indian philosophy is very old, but in the sense of philosophy, the term philosophy was first used by Pythagoras
 vishisht anushaasan or vigyaan ke rup main darshan ko plato ne viksit kiya tha
 It originated as a science in the slave-master society, which had united the gross sum of human knowledge about the objective world and itself
 yah maanav itihaas ke aarambhik sopanon main gyaan ke vikaas ke nimna str ke kaaran sarvatha swaabhaavik tha
 In the process of development of social production and accumulation of scientific knowledge, different sciences got separated from philosophy and philosophy started developing as an independent science
 jagat ke vishay main saamaanya drushtikon kaa vistaar karne tathaa saamaanya aadhaaron va niyamon kaa karne, yatharth ke vishay main chintan kii tarkbuddhiparak, tark tathaa sangyaan ke siddhant viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa se darshanashastra kaa ek vishisht anushaasan ke rup main janm hua
 The fundamental question of philosophy as a separate science is the problem of contemplation with self, the relation of consciousness with ghosts
 darshan vibhinn vishyon kaa vishleshan he 
 Therefore, the philosophy of consciousness is indispensable in Indian philosophy, which is not in modern philosophy
 maanav jivan kaa charam lakshya dukhon se chhutkaaraa praapt karke chir anand kii prapti he
 The same goal of Indian philosophies is to liberate the human from ignorance from the root cause of suffering and attain salvation
 yani agyaan va paramparawaadi or roodhiwaadee vichaaron ko nasht karke satya gyaan ko praapt karnaa hi jivan kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 There has been a tendency for curiosity and exploration in humans since time immemorial
 prakruti ke udbhav tathaa surya, chandra or grahon kii sthiti ke alaava paramatma ke bare main bhi jaanane kii jigyaasa maanav main rahi he
 It is the result of his relentless efforts to eradicate these curiosities that we are living in such a developed society
 parantu pracheen rishi-muniyon ko is bhautik samruddhi se na to santosh hua or na chir anand kii prapti hi hui
 Therefore, in order to attain this truth and knowledge, he started searching for knowledge through subtle and subtle means and he also got success in it
 usee satya gyaan kaa naam darshan he
 Dishtehyeneti darshanam arthath asat evam sat padaarthon kaa gyaan hi darshan he
 The term Western Philosophy is derived from Philos + Sophia
 isliye philosphy kaa shabdic arth he buddhi prem
 The Western philosopher wants to become a wise or intelligent person
 paashchaatya darshan ke itihaas se yah baat jhalak jaati he ki paashchaatya darshanik ne vishay gyaan ke aadhaar par hi budhimaan hona chaha he
 Some examples will be found to the contrary in which it is also found ideal to conduct interviews with Paramasta on the basis of conduct purification and precision of mind
 parantu yah adarsh praachya he na ki paashchaatya
 The Western philosopher insists on his knowledge and does not consider it mandatory to conduct his character according to his knowledge
 keval paashchaatya rahasywaadee or samadhivaadi vichaarak hi iske apwaad hai
 Darshan is another name to be interviewed with supreme authority in Indian philosophy
 bhartiya parampara ke anusaar manushya ko param satta kaa saakshaat gyaan ho saktaa he
 In this way, the path of devotional knowledge and yoga are explained for the interview
 parantu darshanik gyaan ko vaigyanik gyaan se bhinn kaha gaya he
 In acquiring scientific knowledge, the subject of change has to be changed so that it can be subdued according to its will and then its intended use can be done
 parantu praachya darshan ke anusaar darshanik gyaan jivan sadhana he
 Such a philosophy changes the philosopher himself
 use divya drushti praapt ho jaati he
 By which he sees all beings with his macro vision
 samasamyik vichaardhaara main praachya darshan ko dharm-darshan mana jaataa he or paashchaatya darshan ko bhashaa sudhaar tathaa pratyayon kaa spashtikaran kaha jaataa he Philosophy is the interpretation of experience
 is vyakhya main jo kuch aspasht hota he, use spasht karne kaa ytn kiya jaataa he
 Our knowledge centers open outwards, we often dissolve in the external world
 kabhi kabhi hamaara dhyaan antarmukh hota he or ham ek nae lok kaa darshan karte hai
 As soon as the facts are visible, moral sense also commands
 vaastaviktaa or sambhaavna kaa bhed adarsh ke pratyay ko vyakt karata he
 Under the influence of this suffix we look upwards
 is tarah darshan ke pramukh vishay bahya jagat, chetan aatma or paramatma ban jate hai
 While considering them, we naturally consider their relationship
 pracheen kaal main rachana or rachayita kaa sambandh pramukh vishay tha, madhyakaal main aatma or paramatma kaa sambandh pramukh vishay bana or aadhunik kaal main purush or prakruti, vishayi or vishay, kaa sambandh viven kaa centre bana
 Physics, logic and policy in ancient Greece, these three were considered three parts of philosophy
 bhautikee baahar kii ore dekhati he, tark swayan chintan ko chintan kaa vishay banaata he, niti jaananaa chaahati he ki jivan ko vyavasthit karne ke liye koi nirpeksh aadesh gyaat ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The main questions in philosophy are- 1
 gyaan ke atirikt gyaata or gyey kaa bhi astitv he yaa nahin? 2
 What is the nature of final power? Is it one type, or more than one type? pracheen kaal main niti kaa pramukh lakshya ni:shreyas ke swaroop ko samajhnaa tha
 In modern times, Kant replaced the suffix of duty as the fundamental suffix
 tripti yaa prasannataa kaa moolyankan vivaad kaa vishay bana rahaa he
 The main questions in Jnanamimamsa are- 1
 gyaan kya he? 2
 Is there a possibility of knowledge or not? 3
 gyaan praapt kaise hota he? 4
 What are the limitations of human knowledge? gyanamimasaa ne aadhunik kaal main vichaarkon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 Earlier philosophy was often taken in the sense of philosophy
 darshanikon kaa lakshya samgr kii vyavastha kaa pataa lagaana tha
 Whenever it seemed that human intelligence could not go further in this investigation, then some secondary principles became the subject of discussion
 yunaan main, sucraat, plato or arestu ke baad tathaa germany main kaant or hegal ke baad aisa hua
 Realism and skepticism are such theories
 is tarah darshanik vivechan main jin vishyon par vishesh rup se vichaar hota rahaa he, ve ye hai- the main topic - gaun vishay - Thinkers have viewed these subjects from various sides according to their own interests
 kisi ne ek paksh par vishesh dhyaan diya he, kisi ne duusare paksh par
 Sub-problems are present below each problem
 vistrut vivaran ke liye bhartiya darshan dekhen
 Although all philosophy originated from the Vedas, yet the whole of Indian philosophy has been divided into two parts, the believer and the atheist
 jo ishwar tathaa vedokt baton jaise nyaay, vaisheshik, sankhya, yoga, mimasaa or vedant par vishwaas karata he, use aastik mana jaataa he; jo nahin karata vah naastik he
 The Vedic tradition has 6 philosophies: mimasaa nyaay vaisheshik sankhya yoga veydant This philosophy gives knowledge of paravidya, which is beyond the reach of words, from different perspectives
 prayek darshan main anya darshan ho sakate hai, jaise veydant main kai mat hai
 Note - Often people understand that he who does not believe in God is an atheist but here atheist means not believing in Vedas, so all the three philosophies given above come in atheist philosophy] Anarchism · Deism · Deontology · Dualism · Empiricism · Epiphenomenalism · Feminism · Functionalism · Hedonism · Hermeneutics · Humanism · Idealism · Materialism · Monism · Naturalism · Nihilism · Process · Solipsism · Rationalism · Realism · Relativism · Skepticism · Utilitarianism · more

 The biggest potential impact on data accuracy is due to users who delete or block Google Analytics cookies

 Any individual web user can delete or block cookies causing data loss of those visits for GA users
 website maalik, upyogkartaaon ko kukies ko niskriy karne se manaa kar sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye ve gopneeyata niti post karne ke madhyam se ve aagatuk ke liye sait ke upyog ko adhik sukun bharaa bana sakate hai
 Because GA, through a combination of javascript and cookies, uses a page tagging technique to collect visitor information, there are limitations with websites browsed from mobile phones
 aisa is tathy ke kaaran he ki keval naveenatam phone hi javascript chalaa sakate hai yaa kukies set kar sakate hai 
 These limitations affect all on-site web analytics tools that collect on-site visitor data using page tags
 yani, code kaa chota tukdaa jo aagatuk data kaa ekathran karne ke liye bikan ke rup main kaary karata he
 Another limitation of GA for large websites is its use of samples to generate multiple reports
 In order to reduce the load on its servers and to provide users with relatively quick responses to their queries, GA limits reports to 500,000 random samples at the profile level for its calculations
 jabaki truti ke margin ko vizit aankadon ke liye ingit kiya gaya he, truti ke margin ko kisi anya metric ke liye GA report main uplabdh nahin karaayaa gaya he
 For small areas of data, the margin of error can be very large

 Because it cannot always be said which genes are more likely to prove, the best option is the inertia of conservation
 It is possible to assure as many genes as possible
 For ecologists, this latter approach is sometimes considered too restrictive, as it is considered ecological

 Purebred naturally evolved region specific wild species can be threatened with extinction in a big way through the process of genetic pollution i

 In agriculture and animal husbandry, the use of the Green Revolution popularized traditional hybridization by making multiple layers to increase yield "high yielding varieties"
 The handful of plants and cattle breeds often hybridized in developed countries and hybridized with further localized varieties In the rest of the developing world, high-yield strains were resistant to local climates and diseases

due to complete disuse because of un-profitability and uncontrolled intentional and unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding ) formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution resulting in great loss in genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole
 A] is an organism whose gene tick content has been altered using this genetic engineering technique commonly known as recombinant DNA technology
 Genetically modified crops today are not only a common source for genetic contamination of wild varieties, But also other domesticated varieties have become relatively derived from natural hybridization
 It is being said that genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution is destroying that needed unique genetic base thereby creating an unforeseen hidden crisis which will result in a severe threat to our food security for the future when diverse genetic material will cease to exist to be able to further improve or hybridize weakening food crops and livestock against more resistant diseases and climatic changes
 Conservation of this biodiversity has become a global concern

 ], bhagwat aadi puraanon tathaa kathasaritsagar aadi sanskrit granthon main to chanakya kaa naam aayaa hi he, buddha grantho main bhi isaki katha baraabar milti he
 Chanakya's account has been given in the commentary of Vinayapitaka made by Buddhaghosh and the commentary of Mahanam Sthan, composed by Mahanam
 chanakya takshashila ke nivasee the
 The events of his life have a special connection with the accession of Maurya Chandragupta
 ye us samay ke ek prasiddh vidwaan the, isamen koi andeh nahin
 It is said that Chanakya used to live in a small hut away from the royal palace
 unke naam par ek dharawahik bhi bana tha jo doordarshan par 1990 ke dashak main dikhaaya jaataa tha
 The story of Chanakya's friendship with Chadragupta is as follows- patliputra ke raja nand yaa mahanand ke yahan koi yajna tha
 Chanakya also went there and sat down on a pradhan posture during the meal
 maharaj nand ne inkaa kaala rang dekh inhen asana par se uthva diya
 Enraged at this, he vowed that he would not tie his crest till i destroyed the Nandas
 unheen dinon rajkumaar chandragupta rajya se nikaale gaye the
 Chadragupta reconciled with Chanakya and the two men together took the army of Mlechha king Parvatak and marched on Pataliputra and defeated the Nandas in battle

 It is written somewhere that Chanakya sent Nirmalya to Shaktar whom Mahananda and his sons died on touching
 kahin vishakanya bhejne kii katha likhi he
 It is known from the Mudrarakshas drama that even after destroying the Nandas, Chandragupta had great difficulties in attaining the throne of Magadha due to the skill and policy of the demon of Mahananda
 ant main chanakya ne apane nitibal se rakshas ko prasann kiya or chandragupta kaa mantri banaaya
 There is a similar story in Buddhist texts, only in place of 'mahananda' is 'dhanananda'

 Differences are also found regarding their birthplace
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar kautilya kaa janm punjab ke 'chanak' kshetra main hua tha, jabaki kuch vidwaan maanate hai ki uskaa janm dakshin bharat main hua tha
 Many scholars are of the opinion that he was a Dravida Brahmin from Kanchipuram
 vah jivicoparjan kii khoj main uttar bharat aayaa tha
 According to some scholars, Kerala is also said to be his birthplace
 is sambandh main uske dwaara charani nadi kaa ullekh is baat ke pramaan ke rup main diya jaataa he
 In some contexts it is mentioned that Vishnugupta, a resident of Kerala came to Varanasi for pilgrimage, where his daughter was lost
 vah phir kerala waapas nahin lautaa or magadh main aakar bas gaya
 Scholars who hold such views consider him to be a descendant of the Kutullur Namputri dynasty of Kerala
 kai vidwaanon ne use magadh kaa hi mul nivasee mana he
 Some Buddhist literature describes him as a resident of Taxila
 kautilya ke janmasthan ke sambandh main atyadhik matbhed rahane ke kaaran nishchit rup se yah kahana ki uskaa janm sthaan kahan tha, kathin he, parantu kai sandarbhon ke aadhaar par takshashila ko uskaa janm sthaan maananaa thik hoga
 Vk Subramaniam has said that in many contexts it is mentioned that Alexander had met the young Kautilya in his campaign of attack
 chunki alexander kaa akraman adhiktar takshashila kshetra main hua tha, isliye yah ummid kii jaati he ki kautilya kaa janm sthaan takshashila kshetra main hi rahaa hoga
 Kautilya's father's name was Chanak
 vah ek garib brahman tha or kisi tarah apana guzar-basar karata tha
 Therefore, it is clear that Kautilya's childhood must have gone through poverty and problems
 kautilya kii shiksha-diksha ke sambandh main kahin kuch vishesh zikr nahin miltaa he, parantu uski buddhi kaa prakharata or uski vidwata uske vichaaron se parilakshith hoti he
 Despite being ugly, he was physically strong
 uski pustak 'arthshaastra' ke avlokan se uski pratibha, uske bahuaiami vyaktitv or doordarshita kaa purna abhas hota he
 It is said about Kautilya that he was a man of very self-respect and temper
 ek kinvadanti ke anusaar ek baar magadh ke raja mahanand ne shraadh ke avasar par kautilya ko apamaanit kiya tha
 Kautilya, under the influence of anger, opened his crest and vowed that he would not tie his crest till he destroyed the Nandavansh
 kautilya ke vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa yah bhi ek bada kaaran tha
 After the destruction of Nanda Dynasty, he gave all possible help to Chandragupta Maurya to sit on the throne
 chandragupta maury dwaara gaddi par asin hone ke baad use parakramee banane or maury samrajya kaa vistaar karne ke uddeshy se usne vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 He also became the minister of Chandragupta Maurya
 kai vidwaanon ne yah kaha he ki kautilya ne kahin bhi apni rachana main mauryvansh yaa apane mantritv ke sambandh main kuch nahin kaha he, parantu adhikansh sroton ne is tathy kii sampushti kii he
 The vigorous king whom Kautilya portrays in 'arthashastra' is certainly addressed to Chandragupta Maurya
 bharat par sikandar ke akraman ke kaaran chote-chote rajyon kii paraajay se abhibhoot hokar kautilya ne vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa sankalp kiya
 His paramount desire was to see India as a glorious and vast state
 nishchit rup se chandragupta maury uski ichha kaa kendra bindu tha
 Acharya Kautilya is considered as the founder and patron of the Mauryan Empire on the one hand as a well-known and visionary politician, on the other hand he has the distinction of being the only scholar of his subject due to his incomparable and wonderful work in the history of culture literature
 kautilya kii vidwata, nipunata or doordarshita kaa bakhaan bharat ke shastron, kaavyon tathaa anya granthon main parivyapt he
 The story related to the destruction of the Nanda dynasty by Kautilya and the establishment of the Maurya dynasty comes in the Vishnu Purana
 ati vidwaan or maury samrajya kaa mahaamantri hone ke baavjood kautilya kaa jivan saadagi kaa jivan tha
 He was the true symbol of 'plain Life High Thought'

 He used to live in a small house and it is said that the walls of his house were covered with dung cakes
 uski manyata thi ki raja yaa mantri apane charitra or unche aadarshon ke dwaara logon ke saamne ek pratimaan de saktaa he
 He always followed the limits and lived a life of diligence
 kaha jaataa he ki baad main usne mantri pad tyagkar vanprastha jivan vyateet kiya tha
 In fact, he had no desire for money, fame and status
 saratatv main vah ek 'vitaragi', 'tapasvi, karmath or maryaadaaon kaa paalan karanevaala vyakti tha, jiskaa jivan aaj bhi anukaraniya he
 Kautilya is well known as a scholar and a serious thinker, he has also gained fame as a practical and clever politician
 nandavansh ke vinaash tathaa magadh samrajya kii sthapana evam vistaar main uskaa aitihaasik yogadan he
 According to Salatore's statement, Kautilya occupies a paramount place in ancient Indian political thought
 maikiyaveli kii bhanti kautilya ne bhi raajnneeti ko naitikta se pruthak kar ek swatantra shaastra ke rup main adhyayan karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 As it goes kautilya kaa naam, janmatithi or janmasthan teenon hi vivaad ke vishay rahe hai
 There are differences among scholars regarding the name of Kautilya
 kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke pratham anuvadak pandit shaamasasthri ne kautilya naam kaa prayog kiya he
 To prove the authenticity of the name 'kautilya', Pandit Shamashastri has cited vishnu-purana which states- is sambandh main ek vivaad or utpann hua he or vah he kautilya or kautaly kaa
 Ganapathi Shastri has considered 'kautalya' more authentic than 'kautilya'
 unke anusaar kutal gotra hone ke kaaran kautaly naam sahi or sangat prathit hota he
 It has been said under functional ethics - sambashiv shastri ne kaha he ki ganapatishastri ne sambhawatah kautilya ko pracheen sant kutal kaa vanshaj maanakar kautaly naam kaa prayog kiya he, parantu is baat kaa kahin koi pramaan nahin miltaa he ki kautilya sant kutal ke vansh or gotra kaa tha
 The controversy of the names 'kautilya' and 'kautalya' has been raised by many scholars
 ve
 e
 ramasvami ne ganapatishastri ke kathan kaa samarthan kiya he
 Modern scholars have used both names
 paashchaatya vidwaanon ne kautaly or kautilya naam ke vivaad ko adhik mahatva nahin diya he
 According to them, this kind of confusion can be due to the manipulation of the SIC
 adhikansh paashchaatya lekhakon ne kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Scholars in India have used both names, but mostly Kautilya
 is sambandh main radhakant kaa kathan bhi vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 He has said in his composition 'shabdakalpadram' kautilya ke or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 In which the name Chanakya is famous
 kautilya ko chanakya ke naam se pukararane vaale kai vidwaanon kaa mat he ki chaanak kaa putr hone ke kaaran yah chanakya kahalaaya
 On the other hand, according to the legend of some scholars, he was born in Chanak region of Punjab, hence he has been called Chanakya, although no clear evidence is found in this regard
 ek baat spasht he ki kautilya or chanakya ek hi vyakti he
 Apart from the above names, many other names are mentioned, such as Vishnugupta
 kaha jaataa he ki uskaa mul naam vishnugupt hi tha
 His father named him Vishnugupta
 kautilya, chanakya or vishnugupt teenon naamon se sambandhit kai sandarbh milte hai, kintu in teenon naamon ke alaava uske or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, jaise vatsyayan, malang, dravimal, angul, varanak, katyan ityadi in bhinn-bhinn naamon main koun sa sahi naam he or koun-sa galat naam he, yah vivaad kaa vishay he
 But most Western and Indian scholars have used the name Kautilya as the author of 'arthashastra'
 kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon ne kautilya ke astitv par hi prashnvachak chihn laga diya he
 The name Kautilya is symbolic, which is a symbol of diplomacy, according to the opinions of the Victorians, Jolly and Keith
 pantajali dwaara apane mahabhashya main kautilya kaa prasang nahin aane ke kaaran unke maton kaa samarthan mila he
 Jolly has even said that 'arthashastra' is not the work of a person named Kautilya
 yah kisi anya pandit yaa acharya kaa rachit granth he
 Both Shamashastri and Ganapathastri have refuted the views of Western thinkers
 donon kaa yah nishchay mat he ki kautilya kaa purna astitv tha, bhale hi uske naamon main matantar paaya jaataa ho
 In fact, the points raised by these three Western scholars to deny the existence of Kautilya are unrestrained and insignificant
 paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa yah kahana he ki kautilya ne is baat kaa kahin ullekh nahin kiya he ki vah chandragupta maury ke shasankaal main amaatya yaa mantri tha, isliye us 'arthshaastra' kaa lekhan nahin mana ja saktaa he
 This is childish logic
 kautilya ke kai sandarbhon se yah spasht ho chukaa he ki usne chandragupta maury kii sahaayta se nandavansh kaa naash kiya tha or maury samrajya kii sthapana kii thi
 Differences are also found among many scholars regarding Kautilya's works
 kautilya kii kitni kritiyaan hai, is sambandh main koi nishchit soochna uplabdh nahin he
 Kautilya's most important work is the discussion of Arthashastra everywhere, but there is no special mention in relation to other works
 chanakya ke shishy kaamandak ne apane 'nitisar' naamak granth main likhaa he ki vishnugupt chanakya ne apane buddhible se arthshaastra rupi mahodadhi ko mathkar nitishastra rupi amrit nikaala
 Chanakya's 'arthashastra' is a unique treatise on the subject of politics in Sanskrit
 iske niti ke shloke to ghar ghar prachlit hai
 From behind, people compiled many ethics from their policy texts, increasing the number of Vriddhachanakya, Minichanakya, Bodhichanakya etc
 chanakya sab vishyon ke pandit the
 He also has an astrological treatise called ‘vishnugupta Siddhant’
 kehete hai, ayurveda par bhi inkaa likhaa 'vaidyajivan' naam kaa ek granth he
 Justice commentators consider Vatsyayan and Chanakya to be one, but this confusion is the origin of this verse of Hemchand: yon dhaatukautilya or raajnneeti naamak rachanaaon ke saath kautilya kaa naam joda gaya he
 Some scholars believe that in addition to 'arthashastra', if other works of Kautilya are mentioned, it may be a compilation of Kautilya's sayings and statements
 rajya kii utpatti ke sandarbh main kautilya ne spasht rup se kuch nahin kaha kintu kuch sanyogvash kii gai tippaniyon se spasht hota he ki vah rajya ke daivi siddhant ke sthaan par saamaajik samjhaute kaa pakshdhar tha
 Like Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, he calls the natural condition of the state before its anarchy
 rajya kii utpatti tab hui jab 'matsay nyaay' ke kanoon se tang aakar logon ne manu ko apana raja chunaa tathaa apni krishi upaj kaa chatha bhaag tathaa swarna kaa dasva bhaag use dena sweekaar kiya
 In return, the king took responsibility for their safety and welfare
 kautilya rajtantr kaa pakshdhar he
 Kautilya has discussed seven elements of the state by not giving details of the four essential elements of the state - land, population, government and sovereignty, propounded by Western political thinkers
 is sambandh main vah rajya kii paribhaasha nahin detaa kintu pehle se chale aa rahe saptang siddhant kaa samarthan karata he
 Kautilya has compared the state to the human body and has accepted its form
 rajya ke sabhi tatva maanav sharir ke ango ke samaan paraspar sambandhit, antanirbhar tathaa mil-julkar kaary karte hai- Population includes farmers, entrepreneurs and subjects contributing to economic production
 praja ko swamibhakt, parishramee tathaa raja kii ajna kaa paalan karne vaala hona chahie
 In this way, Kautilya's Weekend Principle highlights the important role of all the organs while representing the invariable form of the state
 yadhyapi yah siddhant rajya kii aadhunik paribhaasha se mail nahin khaataa, kintu kautilya ke rajya main aadhunik rajya ke chaaron tatva vidyaman hai
 District is land and population, amatya is the feeling of government and Swami is the symbol of sovereignty
 kosh kaa mahatva rajprabandh, vikaas va sanvardhan main he tathaa sena aantarik shaanti vyavastha tathaa bahari suraksha ke liye aavashyak he
 Friend plays an important role in foreign affairs, but the fortification has been replaced by other tools of defense and defense in the modern era
 pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan kaa anukaran karte hue kautilya ne bhi rajtantr kii sankalpana ko apane chintan kaa kendra banaaya he
 He considers the power of the king to be paramount in temporal matters, but in matters of duties, he himself is bound in religion
 vah dharm kaa vyaakhyaata nahin, balki rakshak he
 Kautilya, considering the state as practicable in itself, has given it the highest position in social life
 rajya kaa hit sarvopari he jiske liye kai baar vah naitikta ke siddhanto ko bhi pare rakh detaa he
 According to Kautilya, the aim of the state is not just to establish peace and order, but to contribute to the supreme development of the person
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya ke kaary hai- The king's tasks are to protect the state from external enemies and invaders, to protect the internal system of justice and to protect the people from divine calamities - floods, earthquakes, famines, fires, epidemics, deadly animals
 swadharm ke antargat varnashram dharm par bal diya gaya he
 Although Kautilya does not subject the state to religion as Manu like religion, but the king preserves religion if the subjects are not followed by religion
 raja kaa karttavya sarsaadhaaran ke liye saamaajik nyaay kii sthapana karnaa he
 Proper functioning of the social system is possible only when father-son, husband-wife, guru-disciple etc
 fulfill their responsibilities
 vivaah-viched kii sthiti main vah stri-purush ke samaan adhikaron par bal detaa he
 Feminine and Brahmin killing is considered a serious crime
 kautilya ke rajya kaa kaary-kshetra atyant vyapak he
 He entrusts the responsibility of multi-faceted development of human beings to the state and makes it a welfare state of the modern era
 usne rajya ko anek kaary saunpe hai
 Such as construction of dams, ponds and other means of irrigation, development of mines, plowing of wastelands, animal husbandry, forest development etc
 inke alaava saarvajanik manoranjan rajya ke niyantran main tha
 The orphans, the poor, the help of the handicapped, the protection of female dignity, the system of remarriage etc
 were also the responsibility of the state
 is prakaar kautilya kaa rajya sarvavyaapak rajya he
 Its goal is to establish public welfare and good administration, in which religion and morality are used as an instrument
 kautilya kaa kahana he, At another place he wrote
 is sambandh main salattore kaa kathan he, ‘‘jis rajya ke paas satta tathaa adhikaar he, uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy apni praja kii prasannataa main vruddhi karnaa he
 Thus Kautilya has appropriately directed the actions of a welfare state
 ’’ Kautilya has discussed not only the internal work of the state, but also the external functions in detail
 is sambandh main vah videsh niti, anterrashtriya sambandhon tathaa yuddh va shaanti ke niyamon kaa vivechan karata he
 In order to analyze the relationship of diplomacy, he has given the board theory- kautilya ne apane mandal siddhant main vibhinn rajyon dwaara duusare rajyon ke prati apanaai niti kaa varnan kiya
 In ancient times, many small states existed in India
 shaktishaalee raja yuddh dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karte the
 States often compromised in other states in terms of security
 kautilya ke anusaar yuddh va vijay dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karne vaale raja ko apane shatruon kii apekshaakrit mitron kii sankhya badhaani chahie, taaki shatruon par niyantran rakhaa ja sake
 On the other hand, weak states should be vigilant against powerful neighboring states
 unhen samaan str vaale rajyon ke saath milakar shaktishaalee rajyon kii vistaar-niti se bachane hetu ek gut yaa ‘mandal’ bananaa chahie
 Kautilya's Mandal theory shows on the basis of geography how the neighboring countries of the state desiring victory can be its friends or enemies
 is siddhant ke anusaar mandal ke kendra main ek aisa raja hota he, jo anya rajyon ko jeetne kaa icchhuk he, ise ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ kaha jaataa he
 The first state to come in the path of "vijigishu" is "ari" and the state adjoining the enemy is "enemy of enemy", hence he is friend of Vijigishu
 kautilya ne ‘‘madhyam’’ va ‘‘udasin’’ rajyon kaa bhi varnan kiya he, jo samarthy hote hue bhi ranneeti main bhaag nahin lete
 This theory of Kautilya is based on realism, which emphasizes making the balance of power through treaties and agreements, considering wars as the reality of international relations
 kautilya ne videsh sambandhon ke sanchaalan hetu chah prakaar kii nitiyon kaa vivaran diya he- According to Kautilya, these policies should be used by the king only for the welfare of the state
 kautilya ne rajya kii videsh niti ke sandarbh main kootneeti ke chaar siddhanton sam, daam, dand tathaa bhed kaa varnan kiya
 According to Kautilya, the first two principles should be used by weak kings and the last two principles should be used by strong kings, but it is also of the opinion that the value is equal, the price is different and the punishment is better than punishment
 dand kaa prayog antim upaay ke rup main kiya jaae, kyonki isse swayan kii bhi kshati hoti he
 Kautilya has described in detail the types and functions of detectives
 guptchar vidhyaarthee grihapati, tapasvi, vyapaaree tathaa vish -kanyaon ke rup main ho sakate the
 The ambassadors also played the role of undercover
 inkaa kaary desh-videsh kii gupt suchnaayen raja tak pahunchaana hota tha
 They contributed to assess the state of public opinion, control the rebels and destroy the enemy state
 kautilya ne guptcharon ko raja dwaara dhan va maan dekar santusht rakhane kaa suzav diya he
 The thoughts of great men have a great influence in the life of people
 chanakya ke vichaaro ne bhi kai logo ke jivan ko unnat kiya he
 Many books have been written about Chanakya's diplomacy and its principles
 chanakya ke jivan ko padhanevaala or iskaa anusaran karanevaala ek bada varg he
 Chanakya's thoughts are called priceless
 chanakya ke vichaar adhyaaapak, raajnneetijna or vyavsaayik logo ko kaaphi pasand he
 Reading about the glorious personality of Acharya Chanakya brings new energy
 kautilya ke vichaar aaj bhi preranadai banate he
 It is true that Kautilya has described a vast organization of secret systems to protect the nation
 shatrunash ke liye vishakanya, ganika, aupnishadik prayog, abhichaar mantra aadi aniatik evam anuchit upayon kaa vidhaan he or is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye mahaan dhan-vyay tathaa dhan-kshay ko bhi raashtra-niti ke anukool ghoshit kiya he
 Seeing such discussions in 'kautilya Arthashastra', Mudrarakshaskaar poet Vishakhadatta Chanakya has been called untruthful and Banabhatta has condemned 'kautilya Arthashastra' as 'nirguna' and 'atinrushyansprayopadesham'
 'manjushri mulkalp' naam kii ek naveen uplabdh aitihaasik kriti main kautilya ko ‘durmati’, krodhan or ‘paapak’ pukarkar garha kaa paatr pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Many modern Western scholars, who specialize in orientalism, have also compared Kautilya to the famous author and politician Mekiavali of Europe, who, in his book 'the Prince', saw the above unethical systems, taking shelter of all the improper means appropriate to achieve the goal
 Has preached vinternitz aadi paashchaatya vidvan kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main nimnlikhit samanthaayen pradarshit karte hai: It is not rational to show such similarity in Kautilya and Mekiavali
 nissandeh kautilya bhi mekiyavali ke samaan yathartwaadee tha or keval adarshavaad kaa anuyaayi na tha
 But to say that Kautilya had completely abandoned religion or morality would be contrary to the truth
 kautilya ne ‘arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran main hi sthapana kii he; That is, do not let the king subjects be disinherited from their religion
 raja bhi apane dharm kaa aacharan kare
 The king who conducts his religion in this way remains happy in this world and the hereafter
 isi pratham adhikaran main hi raja dwaara amaryaadaaon ko vyavasthit karne par bhi bal diya gaya he or varna tathaa ashram-vyavastha ko sudrudh karne ke liye aadesh diya gaya he
 Here the trilogy and the Vedic rituals have been told the basic basis of protection of the subjects
 kautilya ne sthaan-sthaan par raja ko vridhon kii sangat karne vaala, vidya se vinamr, jitendriya or kaam-krodh aadi shatru-shadvarg kaa daman karne vaala kaha he
 How can such a king persecute people by becoming irreligious or tyrannical? In contrast, the king has been called father-like for the subjects, who does the upbringing, enrichment, protection, maintenance, teaching, etc
 of his subjects as he does for his children
 yah thik he ki kautilya ne shatrunash ke liye aniatik upayon ke karne kaa bhi upadesh diya he
 But in this regard the following word of economics should not be forgotten: arthath- in kootneeti ke upayon kaa vyavhaar keval adharmik evam dusht logon ke saath hi kare, dharmik logon ke saath nahin
 Kautilya's state theory is an important contribution to Indian political thought
 usne raajnneetik shaastra ko dharmikata kii ore adhik jhuke hone kii pravriti se mukt kiya
 Although he does not oppose religion and morality, he has kept politics free from the restrictions of ordinary morality
 is drushti se uske vichaar europea darshanik maikyavali ke vichaaron kaa purv sanket prathit hote hai
 On this basis, he is also called the "machiavelli of India"
 celitor kaa mat he ki kautilya kii tulana arastu se karnaa uchit hoga, kyonki donon hi satta hastgat karne ke sthaan par rajya ke uddeshyon ko adhik mahatva dete hai
 Being realistic, Kautilya has focused more on the practical side of the state
 kautilya kaa rajya yadhyapi sarvadhikari he, kintu vah janhit ke prati udasin nahin he
