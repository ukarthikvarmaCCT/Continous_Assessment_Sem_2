 haalanki yuvavastha kii shuruyaat main ladke ladakiyon se ausatan 2 semi chote hote hai, ausat ke aadhaar par vayask purush mahilaon se lagbhag 13 semi lambey hote hai
 This gender difference in height for adults is due to the rapid and slow completion of the growth spurt, which results from delayed growth and lower levels of estradiol in males
 maadaaon ke vikaas ko prabhavit karne vaala hormone ek androgen he jise estrodeol kaha jaataa he

 People who are deficient in leptin do not start puberty
 Leptin levels rise with the onset of puberty and fall to adulthood levels after completion of puberty

 The first few hairs are described as stage 2
 charan 3 aamtaur par 6-12 maheenon ke bich main hota he, jab baalo ko ginana asambhav ho jaataa he
 By step 4, the pubic hairs completely cover the "genitals triangle"
 charan 5 main guptang ke bal jaanghon tak tathaa pet ke baalo ke vikaas ke rup main naabhi se upar kii ore tak fail jate hai
 In the months and years after the pubic hairs appear, androgenic hairs may develop in other parts of the skin due to the reaction of androgens
 saamaanya anukram he: bagalon ke bal, guda ke aas paas bal, upree hont ke bal, kalmon ke bal, stan ke aas paas ke bal or dadhi kshetra main

 Some men do not get full facial hair even after 10 years of puberty
 Chest hair may appear during puberty or some years after it

 Like girls, another effect of androgens can increase the secretion of oil from the skin, which can cause different amounts of acne
 muhaanson se aasaani se roka yaa khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin yuvavastha ke ant main ye aam taur par puri tarah khatm ho jate hai
 Although it is not uncommon for a full-grown adult to suffer from acne frequently, it is generally less severe than acne in adolescents
 kuch vayask muhaanson se bachane ke liye khaas kriimon yaa marahamon kaa prayog kar sakate hai, yaa dawaaen bhi kha sakate hai, jiskaa kaaran yah he ki bhaavnaatmak rup se muhaanson ko sahan karnaa kathin hota he or ye chehre ko daraavna banaate hai
 Usually the first physical obvious sign of puberty in girls, which occurs at about 10
5 years of age, is a soft nodule hanging down the middle portion of the areola of one or both breasts
 ise stan vikaas ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 In the widely used tanner stage for puberty, it is stage 2 of breast development
 
 chah se 12 maheenon ke bheetar, donon taraf sujan spasht rup se shuru ho jaati he, kam hoti he or ise ariola ke kinaaron ke baahar nikalataa hua mahasoos kiya or dekha ja saktaa he
 This is stage 3 of breast development
 agle 12 maheenon tak, ariola tathaa stnegar ke aas-paas ke kshetra kii tilenuma akruti ke saath, stan paripakv akruti or aakaar ke ho jate hai
 In most young women, this mound dissolves into the outline of the mature breast, although there are so many variations in the shape and size of adult breasts that they cannot always be distinguished separately in stages 4 and 5
 guptang ke bal aamtaur par yuvavastha kaa doosraa dhyaan dene yogya parivartan he, jo stan vikaas ke aksar ek kuch maheene ke bheetar shuru hota he
 This change is known as pubarche
 aamtaur par guptang ke bal pehle lebia par dikhaai dete hai
 The first few hairs are described as tanner stage 2
 aamtaur par 6-12 maheene ke bich charan 3 shuru ho jaataa he, jisamen baalo ko ginana asambhav hota he or ye yoni ke paas bhi prakat hone lagate hai
 By step 4, the pubic hairs cover the "genitals triangle"

 minarche ke pashchaat andotsarg kii shuruyaat hona anivaary nahin he
 Girls who have a high proportion of irregularities and ovulation problems in the menstrual cycle for several years after menarche have a higher risk of decreased fertility

 The size of a particular woman until the end of puberty depends on variations in fat distribution as well as gender differences in local skeletal development
 ausatan, 10 varsh kii umr main, ladakiyon ke sharir main ladakon kii tulana main 6% vasa adhik pai jaati he
 Increased levels of androgens can alter the fatty acid composition of sweat, resulting in a more "adult" body odor

 The average age at which puberty begins may also be influenced by race
 udhaaharan ke liye, vibhinn aabaadiyon ke surveykshan main minarche kii ausat aayu 12 se 18 saal ke bich dekhi gayi he
 Early onset of puberty is higher among African American girls and the latest average is the high altitude subsistence population in Asia

 Subsequent studies have shown that puberty begins in 48% of African American girls at the age of nine and in 12% of white girls by this age
 ausat aayu, jisamen yuvavastha kii shuruyaat hoti he, main 1840 ke dashak ke baad giravat aayi he
 Researchers call this decline an 'earthly trend'

 The specific genes affecting time are not yet known
 iname se ek androgen receptor jin ho saktaa he
 Researchers have hypothesized that some products containing hair care estrogen or the placenta, and certain chemicals such as phthalates that are used in cosmetics, toys, and plastic food containers, can lead to premature puberty
 
 agar anuvaanshik kaarak samay se pehle yuvavastha shuru hone ke pachaas pratishat jimmevaar hai, to paryaavaran kaarak bhi utane hi mahatvapurn hai
 One of the earliest observed environmental effects is that puberty occurs late in children living at high altitudes

 Scientists are concerned about the effect of BPA on fetuses, infants and children and the current level of contact, as it can affect the prostate, mammary gland, and premature puberty in girls
 bipie estrogen, jo ek mahatvapurn prajnan or vikaas niamak he, kii nakal or uski karypranali main hastkshep karata he
 It mixes with plastic in food and fluids, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a significantly higher level of BPA was found in more than 90 percent of the US population during the study

 Mental illnesses appear in puberty
 hormonon ke vikaas ke kaaran mastishk kaa vishesh vikaas hota he jiske kaaran manodasha se sambandhit vikaar jaise pramukh avsaadagrastata vikaar, bipoalr vikaar, disthemia or chizophrenia jaise vikaar ho sakate hai
 In girls aged 15 and 19, 40% of cases are due to diet related disorders
 yuvavastha ke samay par kuch sabase kam samajhe gayi paryaavarniya prabhaavon main saamaajik or manovaigyanik prabhaav shaamil hai
 Compared to the effects of genetics, nutrition and general health, the social effects are small, which can change the changes of puberty from a few months to years
 in saamaajik prabhaavon kii karypranali agyaat he, haalanki bataaya jaataa he ki shaareerik prakriyaaon ke kai prakaar, jinamein pheromone bhi shaamil he, jaanwaron par kiye gayi shodh par aadhaarit he
 The most important part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most social impact research has examined family structure and its relationship with early or late onset of female puberty
 zyaadaatar adhyayan bataate hai ki ucch tanaav vaale gharon main un ladakiyon main minarche kii avasthaa pehle ho sakati he, jinke pita unke shuruuaati bachapan main anupasthit the, yaa jinke ghar main sautela pita tha, yaa jinka bachapan main lambe samay tak yon shoshan hota rahaa he, yaa jinhen vikasshil deshon se kam umr main god liya gaya he
 Conversely, menarche may appear late in girls who grow up in a large family with a biological father
 paryaavarniya tanaav kii asahneeya seemaa, jaise yuddh ke samay sharnaarthi kii sthiti, jisamen shaareerik suraksha ko khatra ho, ko paripakvata main deree se judaa paaya gaya he, ek aisa prabhaav jo aahaar kii aparyaaptta se jatil ho saktaa he
 Most of these so-called social influences are minor and not fully understood by us
 adhikansh "prabhaav" aankadon ke rup main hai jo mahamari ke dauraan hue surveykshanon se pataa chale hai
 Statistical associations are not necessarily facts and a wide variety of transformations and alternative explanations can be imagined
 kisi bhi chote bachche par itani choti maatra main padane vaale prabhaav kii pushti yaa khandan karnaa kabhi bhi sambhav nahin he
 Furthermore, the interpretation of data is politically disputed as this type of research can be used for political advocacy
 raajnneetik agenda ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav ke aarope kabhi kabhi vaigyanik aalochana ke saath lagate rahe hai
 Another drawback of social research is that almost all of them are related to girls, some because female puberty requires greater physical resources and some because it involves a unique phenomenon that allows women survey research to be associated with men
 Makes it easier
 adhik jaankaree minarche lekh main di gayi he
 The sequence of events of pubertal development can sometimes vary
 udhaaharan ke liye, 15% ladke or ladakiyon main, pubarche, gonadarche or thelarche se kramshah kuch maheene pehle ho saktaa he
 Rarely, menarche occurs in some of the girls before other signs of puberty appear
 ye parivartan chikitsa moolyankanon ke laayak he kyonki inase kabhi kabhi ek rog kaa sanket miltaa he
 In a general sense, the culmination of puberty is reproductive maturity

 On average, a girl attains the maximum adult height at an average age of 15 years and a boy at an average age of 18 years
 sambhavit prajnan kshamta, ladakiyon main saamanytah 1-2 saal tathaa ladakon main vikaas ke 3-4 saal puure hone se pehle aati he
 Stage 5 typically represents maximal development of the genitals and adult hormone levels
 kai anya shaareerik pranaaliyon kii pratikriyaaon or viniman ke saath, endosirin prajnan pranali hypothelemus, pituitary, jananaang tathaa adrenal grathiyon se mil kar banati he
 Real puberty is called "central puberty" because it begins due to the process of the central nervous system
 hormonal yuvavastha kaa ek saral vivaran is prakaar he: The onset of this neurohormonal process may occur 1–2 years before the first direct physiological change
 hypothelemus kaa arcuat nabhik prajnan pranali kaa sanchaalak he
 It contains neurons that generate the senses of gnrh in the portal venous system of the pituitary gland
 arcuat nabhik ko mastishk ke anya hisson kii tantrikaon kii pratikriyaaon or yonang, adepos utakon or vibhinn prakaar kii anya pranaaliyon se praapt hormonon dwaara prabhavit or niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 The pituitary gland processes the pulsed gnrh in the normal flow of blood, leaving LH and FSH in a pulsed pattern
 jananaang, testosterone evam estrogen steroid sex hormone utpann kar ke alech va enne ke badhate str ke prati pratikriya karte hai
 The adrenal glands are another source of steroid hormones
 adrenal paripakvata, jise adrenarche kaha jaataa he, aam taur par bachapan ke madhya main gonadarche se pehle hoti he
 The endocrine reproductive system becomes functional by the end of the first trimester of fetal life
 janm ke samay vrushan or andashay kuch samay tak niskriy rahete hai kintu janm ke kai maheenon baad hormonal gatividhi phir se shuru karte hai, jab mastishk kaa na samajha ja sakane vaala tantra arcuat nabhik kii prakriya ko roktaa he
 This has been referred to as the maturity of the pre-pubertal "gonadostat", which becomes susceptible to negative feedback by sex steroids
 janm ke kai maheenon baad kii hormonal gatividhiyon kii avadhi ke baad, rokane kii prakriya shuru hoti he jo shishu kii langikta ke anuroop ho sakati he, jiske baad vilambtaa charan shuru hota he, jise sigmund frid ne varnit kiya he
 Gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels fall below about 8 to 10 years of childhood
 There is increasing evidence that the reproductive system is not completely dysfunctional during childhood years
 There is a slight increase in gonadotrophin senses, and future eggs in the ovarian sac surrounding germ cells double in number
 arcuat nabhik main pulse janarator ke nishedh ke saath hi hypothelemus main saamaanya yuvavastha kii prakriya armbh hoti he
 This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is an active inhibition released by other areas of the brain
 signal or tantra jo nishedh se arcuat nabhik ko chhodte hai, dashakon se jaanch kaa vishay hai or puri tarah se samajhe nahin ja sake hai
 Leptin levels increase throughout childhood and allow the arcuate nucleus to process
 agar bachapan main arcuat nabhik kaa vikaas mastishk main chot ke kaaran samay se pehle baadhit ho jaae, to yah gonodotrophin indriyon ko sanchalit kar saktaa he jisase umr se pehle yuvavastha kii prakriya aarambh ho jaayegi
 Neurons of the arcuate nucleus secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone) into the blood of the pituitary portal system
 ek america physiologist, ernest nobil ne paaya ki hypothelemus se jienarech sanket lagbhag 1-2 ghante ke antaraal par nabz ko alech ) ke srav ke liye prerit karte hai
 LH veins are caused by gnrh secretion caused by the rupture of the arcuate nucleus, which itself, is caused by the shivering of signals or signal generators of the central brain system

 By the end of puberty, there is little difference in the intensity and frequency of gonadotrophin senses during the day and night
 kuch jaanchakartaaon ne yuvavastha kii shuruyaat ke liye mastishk main kanpakanpi kii pratidhwani ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Accordingly, this statement represents the senses of the genitals bursting into the night shortly before puberty
 "swatah teevr hone vaali prakriyaaon" kaa samooh hypothelemus, piyush granthi or jananaangon main kishoravastha ke liye uttaradaayi hormonon kii maatra ko badha detaa he
 Regulation of the adrenarche and its relation to the maturation of hypothalamic genitals has not yet been fully understood, and according to some evidence it is a large independent process parallel to or beyond puberty
 adrenal androgen ke badhate str kii 6 va 11 varsh ke bich, yahaan tak ki hypothelemic yuvavastha kii jananaang nason kii vruddhi se pehle bhi, pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 Adrenal androgens are responsible for genital hair, adult body odor and other androgenic changes in both sexes
 adrenarche or gonadarche ke bich antar kaa praathmik chikitsiya mahatv yah he ki inke dwaara guptang ke baalo or sharir kii gandh jaise parivartan yah pramanit nahin karte ki koi baccha yuvastha ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 The early stages of hypothalamic maturation in males seem to be very similar to the early stages of female puberty, although they occur 1–2 years later
 alech vrushan kii ledig koshikaon ko testosterone banane ke liye uttejit karte hai or rakt ke str main vruddhi shuru ho jaati he
 For most of puberty, nighttime levels of testosterone are higher than daytime levels
 maadaaon kii yuvavastha kii tulana main naron ko janan shiraaon main vruddhi kii aavriti kii niyamitata or tivrata kii kam aavashyaktaa hoti he
 However, in adolescent boys, a significant portion of testosterone is converted to estradiol
 estrodeol vikaas main oochaal, haddi kii paripakvata or ladakiyon kii tarah ladakon main apifizal ko band karne ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Estradiol also induces the development of breast tissue in a large proportion in boys
 ladakon main yuvavastha ke dauraan jab halke ginacomestia yaa suje hue stnagron kii samasya ho jaati he to unhen bataaya jaataa he ki kuch purush kishoron main estrodeol ke ucch str kaaran ye prabhaav asthai hote hai
 Male hormonal changes in most young men occur during adolescence
 naron ke jivan ke is bindu par, testosterone ke str main dhire dhire vruddhi hoti he or adhikansh prabhaav androgen receptaron ke madhyam se diahydrotestosterone ke niojit angon main badlaav ke rup main sanchalit hote hai
 As the LH pulse increases, the theca cells of the vagina begin to produce testosterone and a small amount of progesterone
 zyaadaatar testosterone aasapaas kii koshikaon main samaa jaataa he jinhen granulosa koshikaayen kehete hai
 a small increase in FSH increases the aromatase activities responsible for the growth of these granulosa cells, which convert most testosterone into estradiol for secretion into the veins
 estrodeol kaa badhata str maadaa yuvavastha main estrogen visheshtaon se sambandhit shaareerik badlaav laata he: teevr vikaas, haddiyon kii paripakvata main vruddhi yaa roak, stanon kaa vikaas, vasa kii badi hui sanrachana, garbhashay kaa vikaas, jhilli or yoni kii twachaa kii motaai kaa badhanaa, tathaa nichali shroni kii chaudaai badhanaa
 As estradiol levels rise slowly and other naturally occurring processes develop, the stage of adulthood is attained as soon as the hypothalamic "gonadostat" is reported to be functional
 sakaaratmak pratikriya kii yah uplabdhi mahila yon paripakvata kii parichaayak he, kyonki yah andotsarg ke liye madhya chakra alech aavesh kii anumati detaa he
 Adrenal androgens and testosterone levels also increase during puberty, producing specific androgenic changes in female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hairs as noted above, body odor, pimples

 IGF1 levels increase and then decrease at the end of puberty

 Laboratory evaluation of the antibacterial elements used to kill Curvis is useful in determining actimicrobial activity based on timing or concentration
 aamtaur par pratijaivik dawaaon kaa vargeekaran unki karrwai ke tantra, rasinic sanrachana yaa gatividhi ke spectrum ke aadhaar par hota he
 Most antibiotics target the function of bacteria or their growth process
 pratijaivik dawaaen, jo bacteria kii koshika diwaar yaa koshika jhilli, yaa aavashyak jeevanu anzime par lakshya kendrit karti hai, saamanyat: jeevanunashak prakruti kii hoti hai
 Those that target protein synthesis, such as aminoglycosides, microlides, and tetracycline, are usually bacteriostatic and have a specific classification based on their targets: such as "compressed spectrum antibiotics" in particular types of bacteria, such as Gram negative, Or targets Gram-positive bacteria, while broad-spectrum antibiotics Affect a wide range
 pichley kuch varshon main pratijaivik dawaaon ke teen nae varg nidaan ke liye istemaal kiye ja rahe hai
 Thus, it has taken 40 years to discover new classes of antibiotic compounds
 in nai pratijaivik dawaaon ke nimnlikhit teen varg hai: cyclic lipopapatids, glicilsiclins ,or oxajolidinons 
 tigeciclin ek vyapak spectrum pratijaivik he, jabaki do anya kaa upyog gram-positive sankraman ke ilaaj ke liye hota he
 These developments can be seen as an expectation of a means of measuring bacterial resistance to current antibiotics
 1939 main pehali baar flore or chaiyn ke ahm prayaason ke baad se chikitsa main pratijaivik dawaaon ke mahatv ke kaaran inaki khoj or utpaadan ke liye shodh kii prerana mili he
 The process of production usually involves inspection and testing and modification of broad categories of microorganisms
 utpaadan kinvan ke jariye, aamtaur par majboot aerobics tareeke se kiya jaataa he
 Oral antibiotics are swallowed, while intravenous antibiotics are used in more severe cases, such as deep-seated systemic infections
 pratijaivik kaa prayog kabhi-kabhi baahar se bhi kiya jaataa he, jaise aankh main daali jane vaali dawaaen yaa maraham
 Although antibiotics are generally considered safe and well-tolerated, they are also widely associated with adverse effects
 dushprabhav kai tarah ke, vividh roopon vaale or puri tarah pratijaivik ke upyog or lakshyit kiye jane vaale sookshmjivon par nirbhar hote hai
 The safety profile of treatment with new drugs is not as established as the drugs used for many years
 pratikul prabhaav bukhaar or michali se lekar photodermatitis or anophilix jaise bade allergy tak ke rup main dikh sakate hai
 One of the most common side effects is pain, sometimes caused by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile, and is caused by the antibiotic disturbing the normal balance of the intestinal flora
 rog paidaa karne vaale bacteria kii is tarah ativruddhi ko pratijaivik lene ke dauraan pro-biotic kii khuraaq lene khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 Antibiotics may also increase the number of bacteria that are normally present as components of the vaginal flora and may lead to the over-development of the genus Candida yeast in the vulva-vaginal area
 duusari dawaaon ke saath antarkriyasheeltaa se duusare parshv kuprabhavon bhi dikh sakate hai, jaise pranaligat corticosteroid ke saath ek quinolon pratijaivik lene se kandra kii kshati kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 It is estimated that some antibiotics interfere with the effectiveness of birth control pills in two ways
 antra flora main sanshodhan se estrogens ke avasorana main kami aa sakati he
 Secondly, taking hepatic liver enzymes increases the metabolism of the active ingredients of the pill and may affect the usefulness of the pill
 haalanki zyaadaatar adhyayanon ke jariye yah sanket miltaa he ki pratijaivik dawaaen garbhanirodhakon ke kaam main hastkshep nahin karti hai
 Although some percent of women experience less effect of birth control pills while taking antibiotics, the failure rate can be compared to women taking pills
 iske alaava, koi anya adhyayan nahin dikhataa he, jisase antim taur par pataa chale ki pet ke flora main vyavdhaan garbhanirodhak ko prabhavit karata he
 This may be caused by taking the oral contraceptive pill through the induction of liver enzymes by the antifungal drug grisofulvin and broad-spectrum antibiotic rifampicin
 isliye sifarish kii jaati he ki in antimicrobeales ke prayog se roganurodhi chikitsa ke dauraan atirikt garbhanirodhak upayon kaa sahaara lenaa chahie
 Alcohol can interfere with the activity of antibiotics or metabolites, which can affect the activity of liver enzymes, thereby eliminating the effect of antibiotics
 iske alaava, metronidazol, tinidazol, sifamendol, ketaconajol, latmoxef, sifoprajon, sefemenoksime or furajolidine jaise kuch pratijaivik alcohol ke saath pratikriya karte hai, jisase gambhir parshv kuprabhav, jinamein ulti, michali or saans kii takalif shaamil he, dikhte hai
 Therefore, alcohol should not be consumed while taking such antibiotics
 Additionally, alcohol consumption may decrease serum levels of doxycycline and erythromycin succinate under certain circumstances
 pratijaivik pratirodh kaa udbhav ek vikasshil prakriya he, jo jeev ke chayan par aadhaarit he or jisase pratijaivik dawaaon kii khuraaq ke liye jivit rahane kii kshamta main vruddhi hui he, jo pehle ghaatak hota tha
 Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which were once considered miraculous cures, are now shown to be less effective, as bacteria are becoming more resistant
 pratijaivik khud ek chaynaatmak dabaav ke rup main kaam karte hai, jo ek nishchit sankhya main pratirodhi jeevanuon ke vikaas kii anumati dete hai or phir saralata se nasht hone vaale jeevanuon ko jivit rakhte hai
 Antibiotic resistant mutant organisms already present within the bacterial population were demonstrated through the Luria – Delbrück experiment in 1943
 jeevanu kaa jivan aksar viraasat main mili pratirodh kaa parinaam hota he
 Any antibiotic resistance demands a biological price and the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria can be affected by decreased fitness along with resistance, which proves beneficial in keeping bacteria alive especially when antibiotics are not present
 haalanki, atirikt utparivarti jeev fitness kii keemat kii bharpai or in jeevanuon kaa astitv behaal rakhane main madad kar sakate hai
 The underlying molecular resistance mechanism leading to antibiotic resistance can vary
 jeevanu kii anuvanshik banaavat ke kaaran moolbhoot pratirodh swaabhaavik he bacterial gunasutra us protein ko encode karne main vifal ho saktaa he, jise pratijaivik nishaanaa banaata he
 Acquired resistance arises from changes in the bacterial chromosome or acquisition of additional chromosomal DNA
 pratijaivik utpaadit karne vaale jeevanu saral se jatil banane ke pratirohak tantra kaa hissaa hote hai, dekhne main unke jaise hi hote hai or pratijaivik pratirodhi upabhedon main sthanantarit ho sakate hai
 The spread of antibiotic resistance mechanisms occurs via horizontal genetic exchange through peak transmission of inherited changes from previous generations and genetic recombination of DNA
 pratijaivik pratirodh kaa plasmid dwaara vibhinn jeevanuon ke bich vinimay ho saktaa he, jo jeevanurodhi pratirodh ko incode karte hai or jisase ekaadhik pratijaivik kaa sah astitv sambhav hota he
 These plasmids may hold distinct genes with diverse resistance mechanisms and may belong to unrelated antibiotics, as they produce more plasmid multiple antibiotic resistance than one antibiotic transferred
 vaikalpik rup se bacteria ke bheetar anya pratijaivik kaa aapasi pratirodh tab hota he, jab chune gayi ek pratijaivik se zyada ke pratirodh ke liye jimmevaar vaisaa hi pratirodh tantra paidaa hota he
 Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics are a major factor in the emergence of resistant bacteria
 samasya tab or jatil ho jaati he, jab ek yogya chikitsak ke nirdeshon ke bina khud pratijaivik lenaa shuru karata he or krishi main vikaas pramotaron ke rup main pratijaivik kaa gaiyr-chikitsakeey upyog hota he
 Antibiotics frequently indicate where they are not needed, or that the use is incorrect or that the antibiotic given is of minor effect
 yah kuch vaise maamalon main bhi hota he, jahaan sankraman bina ilaaj ke bhi thik ho saktaa he
 Antagonists such as penicillin and erythromycin, which were once considered miraculous cures, began to emerge from the 1950s on resistance to its anti-inflammatory elements
 aspataalon main pratijaivik dawaaon ke chikitsiya upyog ko bahu-pratijaivik pratirodhi jeevanuon kii vruddhi ke saath joda jaataa he
 Common forms of antibiotic abuse include over-use of prophylactic antibiotics by the passengers, not taking into account the patient's weight and the antibiotics previously administered to them, as both destroy the effectiveness of antibiotics and even fail the entire course

 aisa pratijaivik likhte samay unhen lene ke antaraal kaa ullekh nahin karne, sankramit jeev ke puri tarah swasth hone ke liye aaraam kaa abhaav hone se bhi pratijaivik vifal ho sakate hai
 Doing so will help in increasing the population of bacteria with antibiotic resistance
 Inappropriate antibiotic treatment is a common form of antibiotic abuse
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan ke rup main, ham aam sardi-zukam ke liye viral sankraman dur karne vaali pratijaivik dawaaon ke istemaal ko le sakate hai, jiskaa us par koi asar nahin hota

 Multidisciplinary intervention by both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics
 shwaas nalika ke sankraman kaa sahaj nidaan ke liye pratijaivik dawaaon ke lene main 48 ghante kaa vilamb pratijaivik ke istemaal ko kam kar saktaa hai
 However, this strategy can decrease the feeling of satisfaction in the patient
