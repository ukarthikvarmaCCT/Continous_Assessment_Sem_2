 ek baar marichi nandan kashyap ji ne bhagwaan ko prasann karne ke liye kheer kii aahuti diya or unki aradhana samaapt karke sandhyaa kaal ke samay agnishala main dhyansth hokar baithe gayi
 At the same time, Diti, the daughter of Daksha Prajapati, went to Kashyapji with a longing for getting a son after becoming lustful
 diti ne kashyap ji se mithe vachanon se apane saath raman karne ke liye prarthana kiya
 On this, Kashyap ji said, "oh dear! i will definitely give you a bright son as per your wish
 kintu tumhen ek prahar ke liye pratiksha kerani hogi
 In the evening, after sunset, Bhootnath Lord Shankar takes his ghost, ghost and yakshas to climb on the bull
 is samay tumhen kamkrida main rat dekh kar ve aprasann ho jaavenge
 Therefore, this time is not suitable for procreation
 sara sansar meri ninda karegaa
 This time is only for evening worship and Bhagavat worship
 is samay jo pishaachon jaisaa aacharan karte hai ve narkagami hote hai
 " pati ke is prakaar samajhane par bhi use kuch bhi samaj main na aayaa or us kamaatur diti ne nirlajj bhav se kashyap ji ke vastra pakad liye
 On this, Kashyap ji, assuming strong desire, greeted the divine and fulfilled the wish of Diti and after bathing with pure water, started chanting Gayatri as the eternal Brahman form
 diti ne garbh dhaaran kar ke kashyap ji se prarthana kii, "he aryaputra! bhagwaan bhootnath mere aparaadh ko kshamaa karen or meraa yah garbh nasht na karen
 His nature is very fierce
 kintu ve apane bhakton kii sadaa raksha karte hai
 They are my brothers-in-law, i greet them
 " When Kashyap retired from the evening, he saw his wife praying for the benefit of his children and trembling with awe, then he said, "oh Diti! You did not listen to me
 tumhaara chitt kaam vaasana main lipt tha
 You have enjoyed untimely tumhaare kokh se maha bhayankar amangalakaari do adham putr utpann honge
 The innocent people of the entire world will suffer from their atrocities
 dharm kaa naash karenge
 Will persecute saints and women
 unke paapon kaa gadaa bhar jane par bhagwaan kupit ho kar unka vadh karenge
 " diti ne kaha, "he bhagwan! meri bhi yahi ichha he ki mere putron kaa vadh bhagwaan ke haath se hi ho
 Do not be under the curse of a Brahmin, because through a curse of a Brahmin, a creature goes to hell and takes birth
 " tab kashyap ji bole, "he devi! tumhen apane karm kaa ati pashchaatap he is liye tumhaara naati bhagwaan kaa bahut bada bhakt hoga or tumhaare yash ko ujwal karegaa
 That child will serve the saints and conquer Kaal and become a councilor of God
 " Diti was overjoyed to hear of the birth of a Bhagavadbhukta grandson from the mouth of Kashyap ji and his regret over hearing the slaughter of his sons from God
 uske do putr hiranyaksh tathaa hiranyakashyapu kaa janm hua or vidhi ke vidhaanon ke hisaab se ye dushtataa kii raah par chal pade

 ek baar sanak, sanandan, sanathan or sanatkumar sampoorn lokon se virakt hokar chitt kii shaanti ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ke darshan karne hetu unke baikuntha lok main gayi
 Two gatekeepers named Jai and Vijay were guarded at the gate of Baikuntha
 jai or vijay ne in sanakadik rishiyon ko dwaar par hi roak liya or baikuntha lok ke bheetar jane se manaa karne lage
 On their refusal in this way, the Sankadik sages said, "oh fools! We are the ultimate devotees of Lord Vishnu
 hamaari gati kahin bhi nahin rukati he
 We want to see Devadhidev
 tum hamen unke darshanon se kyon rokte ho? tum log to bhagwaan kii seva main rahete ho, tumhen to unheen ke samaan samdarshi hona chaiye
 The nature of God is absolute peace, so should your nature
 hamen bhagwaan vishnu ke darshan ke liye jane do
 "even when the sages say this, Jai and Vijay stop them from entering Baikunth
 jai or vijay ke is prakaar rokane par sanakadik rishiyon ne cruddh hokar kaha, "bhagwaan vishnu ke sameep rahane ke baad bhi tum logon main ahankaar aa gaya he or ahamkaari kaa vaas baikuntha main nahin ho saktaa
 That is why we curse you that you go into sin and enjoy the consequences of your sin
 " unke is prakaar shaap dene par jai or vijay bhaybheet hokar unke charnon main gir pade or kshamaa maangane lage
 Knowing that the Sanakadik sages have come to meet Lord Vishnu himself, along with Lakshmi ji and all his councilors, came to welcome him
 bhagwaan vishnu ne unase kaha, "he munishwaron! ye jai or vijay naam ke mere parshad hai
 Both of them have taken offense by insulting you with arrogance and intellect
 aap log mere priy bhakt hai or inhone aapaki avagya karke meri bhi avagya kii he
 You have done a great job by cursing them
 in anucharon ne brahmanon kaa tiraskaar kiya he or use main apana hi tiraskaar maanata hoon
 i apologize on behalf of these councilors
 sevakon kaa aparaadh hone par bhi sansar swami kaa hi aparaadh maanata he
 Therefore, i wish you begging for happiness
 " The anger of the Sanakadik sages immediately calmed down with these sweet words of God
 bhagwaan kii is udaartaa se ve ati anandit huye or bole, "aap dharm kii maryaada rakhane ke liye hi brahmanon ko itnaa aadar dete hai
 Hey Nath! We have cursed these innocent councilors under the control of anger and we apologize for this
 aap uchit samajhen to in dwarapalon ko kshamaa karke hamaare shaap se mukt kar sakate hai
 " bhagwaan vishnu ne kaha, "he muniganon! mai sarvashaktimaan hone ke baad bhi brahmanon ke vachan ko asaty nahin karnaa chahta kyonki isse dharm kaa ulanghan hota he
 The curse that you have given is from my inspiration
 ye avashya hi is dand ke bhaagi hai
 They will go into the womb of Diti and get the monster's vagina and they will be killed by me
 ye mujhase shatrubhav rakhte huye bhi mere hi dhyaan main leen rahenge
 After i kill them, they will come back to this dham again
 " Jai and Vijay fall from Baikunth and fall into Diti's womb

 Both demons rose to the sky as soon as they were born
 unka sharir faaulad ke samaan parvataakaar ho gaya
 He was wearing golden armor, helix, girdle, armlet etc
 hiranyakashyapu ne tap karke brahma ji ko prasann kar liya
 He took a boon from Brahma ji that his death should be neither in the day nor at night, neither inside the house nor outside
 is tarah se abhaya ho kar or teenon lokon par vijay praapt kar ke vah ek chhatra rajya karne laga
 His younger brother Hiranyaksha obeyed his orders and started destroying the enemies
 ek din ghoomte ghoomte vah varun kii puri main ja pahunchaa
 Upon reaching Hatalak, Hiranyaksha pleaded for war with Varun Dev and said, "O Varun Dev! You have conquered all the demons and demons of the world
 main aapse yuddh kii bhiksha maangata hoon
 You should prove your fighting skills by fighting with me
 us daitya kii baat sun kar varun dev ko krodh to bahut aayaa par samay ko dekhte huye unhone hanste huye kaha, "are bhai! ab ladane kaa chaav nahin rahaa he or tum jaise balashaali vir se ladane ke yogya ab ham rah bhi nahin gayi hai
 You should go to Yajnapurusha Narayan
 ve hi tumse ladane yogya hai
 Hearing the talk of Varun Dev, that monster went to Devarshi Narada and asked for Narayana's address
 devarshi naarad ne use bataaya ki narayan is samay varah kaa rup dhaaran kar prithvi ko rasaatal se nikaalane ke liye gayi hai
 Hiranyaksha reached the abyss on this
 vahaan usne bhagwaan varah ko apane dadh par rakh kar prithvi ko laate huye dekha
 That Mahabali monster said to the Varaha God, "hey wild animal! Where have you come from in the water? Stupid animal! Where are you taking this earth? Brahma ji has given it to us
 re adham! tu mere rahete is prithvi ko rasaatal se nahin le ja saktaa
 You are the enemy of demons and demons, so today i will kill you
 " Hearing these words of Hiranyaksha, Varaha God was very angry, but leaving the earth there, he did not think it appropriate to fight and he endured his bitter words and soon came out of the water like Gajraj
 unka peechha karte huye hiranyaksh bhi baahar aayaa or kehane laga, "re kaayar! tuje bhaagane main lajja nahin aati? aakar mujhase yuddh kar
 "putting the earth in the proper place on the water and providing its proper foundation, Lord Varah turned to the monster and said," Hey Gram Singh! We are wild animals and keep searching for village lions like you
 ab teri mrityu sir par naach rahi he
 "hearing these sarcastic words, Hiranyaksha pounced on him
 bhagwaan varah or hiranyaksh me madhya bhayankar yuddh hua or ant main hiranyaksh kaa bhagwaan varah ke haathon vadh ho gaya
 After the victory of Lord Varaha, all the gods including Brahma ji started praising them by pouring flowers from the sky
 brahma nen manu or satarupa kaa nirmaan kiya or sristi karne kii ajna di
 For this, land is required which the monster named Hiranyaksha slept in the ocean with a pillow to the earth goddess and kept the circle of worship for fear of the gods
 manu satarupa ko jal hi jal dikhaa jiske bare main brahma ko bataaya tab brahma ne sochaa ki sabhi dev to vishtha ke paas tak nahin jate, ek shookar hi he jo vishtha ke sameep ja saktaa he
 He meditated on Lord Vishnu and gave birth to Varaha Narayana from his nose, commanded to bring the earth up
 varah bhagwaan samudr main utre or hiranyaksh kaa sanhaar kar bhu devi ko mukt kiya

 TVN reporter Mita Mattu reports that the police, with their huge squad, have intervened and fired more than 3000 rounds of ammunition into a very quiet residential area without any announcement

 khan, inspector kaviraj patil or police hawaldaar javed sheikh 
 The main timeline of the film also passes with Dhingra being interviewed by these three officers; Where those officers answer the questions of Dhingra, with which several flashbacks in the film refer to the above events
 dhingra unase is encounter daste ke bare main puchhatacha karte hai
 Khan says that he has selected many of the best 27 personnel and officers from the Mumbai Police Department
 is daste ko banane kaa khyaal unhen america, elepidi swat team ke aparaadh kaa saamana karte dekhne se mili
 Simultaneously, in the film's flashback, Khan is trained to select those men and to make them "agile, capable and deadly" on a physical and mental level
 dhingra bamushkil hi unase prabhavit hote hai: vah is maamle par ingit bhi karte hai ki yadi khan "shoots tu kil" par yakeen rakhte hai to unamem or gangster main koi fark nahin rah jayega jinka vah khaatmaa karnaa chaahate hai
 The case begins to take hold when, for Khan's spotlight, he monitors Maya's various criminal and possibly terrorist activities through his network of spies and newsmen
 isi samay ke saath, maaya apane mahatvakankshaon ke saath, vah apni ai kii bhi zide puri karata hai, vah yah chaahane lagata he ki ek roj dubai main baithe hukmaranon kii jad se chhutne baad vah puure mumbai par kabja jamaa legaa
 The objective of Khan's ATS is now focused on removing Maya and Bhuya, with which the dangerous game of pimples starts where there is no chance of escaping its attack but in this strategy, the enemy tries to Be helpless as well
 khan phir un aparaadhiyon ke parivarajanon se milakar unke aropiyon ko bina jahamat ke samarpan karne kii salaah dete hai
 In return, Maya and her men also forcibly interfere in the private affairs of the policemen and "meet" them
 maaya restaraan main khan se miltaa he jab vah apane parivaar sang bhojan par mashgul rahata he
 Maya immediately tells Khan: "this matter is between your men and me
 bich main family ko mat lao
 "khan also hurts on her words and says:" i also wanted you to come and clear the matter yourself
 par vakt aa gaya he ki yah masalaa faansee ke fande par khatm hoga yaa bandook kii goliyon se
 " vahiin maaya kaa gussa tab badhata he jab mashhoor shahari builder vadhvani use baahar kar detaa he 
 Maya threatens to give him 4 crore protection money; Wadhwani takes the matter to Dubai
 maaya tab vadhvani ke saamne hi bachche kii tarah naak sudakane vaale, mote kism ke ladke ko aguva kar letaa he
 Complaining to Wadhwani, Big Boss then asks Maya to return the child immediately
 maaya phir baas se bahut unchi maang rakhata he or saath main puure mumbai par ecchhatra raaj karne kii baat sunaata he
 Like many characters of the film, it also reveals his personal life
 khan kii patni rohini bhi ab apane hi parivaar ke liye mahatv naa de paane kaaran uske saath rah naa paane kii asamarthta jataati he
 And petition for divorce
 patil unke talaak ke maamle ko sulajhaata he
 At the same time, in the group of enemies, Buva spends time hiding with his bar dancer girlfriend Tannu, saying that he is no longer able to spend time with her
 vahiin uske apradhi saathi fattu or aar
si
 bhi apni mushkilon se jujhte rahete hai
 Then that decisive day of November 1991 comes
 paanch aparaadhiyon main se maaya or buvaa khud ko sabase bachaane ke liye, apahrit vadhvani ke bachche ke saath, lokhandwala ke swati building ke flats main chupe rahete hai
 Khan's secret information gets to know about that area
 khan apane hathiyaarband sipaahiyon evam afasaron ke jatthon ke saath ilaake ke gheraabandi kar letaa he
 He gives strict instructions to the residents that they stay indoors and close the windows
 phir to banduukon-goliyaan kii ek lambii or behad ghamaasan ladaai chhid jaati he
 Buva rocket propelled in the flat causes great damage by launching grenade and tries to escape
 lekin police kii jabardast golibari ke vajah se unka manobal tut jaataa he, or sabhi paanchon apradhi maar giraae jate hai
 In this fierce battle, the building suffers a lot of damage: the film scenes almost destroy the stairs, passageways and houses of various citizens
 reporter mita mattu is puure vaardaat kaa sajiv prasaaran karti he
 In this final decision, Dhingra's side remains negative and Khan and ATS cite an exception to this action
 ve adaalat main tamaam press reporton evam nagarikon kii shikayaton ke maddenjar dekhte hue khan par is ekapakshiya faisle or anepakshit tareeke se apane behisaab hathiyaarband dasten ke saath ek rihaayshi ilaake kii shanti bhang karne kii avmaananaa kaa aarope madhte hai
 Khan and his ATS were to be punished
 lekin jab dhingra ne unke bachaav paksh par vakaalat karne kaa khulaasa karte he, to is arshyachakit karne vaale mode main, ve bachaav main ek aparamparaagat tark-vitark si daleel pesh karte hai
 At the end of the film, Khan and his ATS squad are shown acquitted by the court
 anand raaj anand, mika, biddu Although the origins of the Assamese language are believed to date from the 17th century, the display of literary interests began in the 13th century with the Drona festival of Kandali and the Ramayana of Kandali
 vaishnavi andolan ne prantiy sahitya ko bal diya
 Shankar Dev kept this movement alive in his long life-journey with lyrical poetry, drama and songs
 asamiya ke shisht or likhit sahitya kaa itihaas paanch kaalon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he: Hem Saraswati and Harivar Vip can be considered as the earliest poets of Assamese based on the latest available material
 hem saraswati kaa "prahlaadacharitra" asamiya kaa pratham likhit granth mana jaataa he
 Both these poets were dependents of Kamatur's ruler Rare Narayan
 ek tisare prasiddh kavi kabiratn saraswati bhi the, jinhone "jaydrathvadh" likhaa
 But the most famous poet of the Vaishnavite period was Madhava Kandali, who composed his compositions under the shelter of King Mahamanya
 madhav kandali ke ramayana ke anuwaad ne vishesh khyaati praapt kii
 Converting Sanskrit vocabulary into Assamese was a special art of the poet
 is kaal kii anya footkar rachanaaon main kuch geetikavy ullekhneey hai
 In these compositions, the people of the time were particularly rewarded
 tantra mantra, manasapuja aadi ke vidhaan is varg kii kritiyon main adhik charchit hue hai
 Some deities associated with Vishnu were given importance in earlier compositions of this period
 parantu aage chalakar vishnu kii puja kii vishesh rup se pratishtha hui
 In this change of position, the sum of the great Assamese poet and religious reformer Shankardev AD was more than enough
 shankardev kii adhikansh rachanaayen bhagwatpurana par aadhaarit hai or unke mat ko bhagwati dharm kaha jaataa he
 Shankardev is credited for adapting Assamese life and culture in its specific form
 isliye kuch sameekshak unke vyaktitv ko keval kavi ke rup main hi simit nahin karnaa chaahate
 They basically consider him as a religious reformer
 shankardev kii bhakthi ke pramukh aashray the shrikrishna
 He has about 30 compositions, of which "kirthanghosh" is his masterpiece
 asamiya sahitya ke prasiddh natyarup "ankiya naatak" ke prarambhkarta bhi shankardev hi hai
 His plays offer an equal mix of prose and verse
 in naatakon kii bhashaa par maithili kaa prabhaav he
 The phrase "ankiya Nataka" is called "vargit", whose language is mainly Brajbuli

 His personality was versatile

 "namghosha" is his masterpiece
 shankardev ke naatakon main "chordhara" adhik prasiddh rachana he
 Among other writers of this era, Anant Kandali, Sridhar Kandali and Bhattadev are particularly notable
 asamiya gadhy ko sthirikrut karne main bhattadev kaa aitihaasik yoga mana jaataa he
 After the Ahom kings were established in Assam, the inspiring trend of literature composed in their shelter became secular rather than religious
 raajaaon kaa yashvarnan is kaal ke kaviyon kaa ek pramukh kartavya ho gaya
 As such, the tradition of historiography was already prevalent among the Ahom kings
 kaviyon kii yashvarnan kii pravriti ko ashrayadata raajaaon ne is ore mode diya
 First the Ahom language history texts were translated into Assamese and then basically the Buranjis started being created
 "buranji" mulat: ek ti shabd he, jiskaa arth he "agyaat kathaon kaa bhandar"
 a considerable systematic history of the medieval era of Assam is available through these Buranjis
 buranji sahitya ke antargat kamrup buranji, kachaari buranji, ahom buranji, jayantiya bunraji, beliar buranji ke naam apekshaakrit adhik prasiddh hai
 Apart from these Buranji texts, extensive dynasties of dynasties also occurred during this period
 upyogi sahitya kii drushti se is yug main jyotish, ganit, chikitsa aadi vigyaan sambandhi granthon kaa srijan hua
 Books on art and dance were also written
 is samast bahumukhi sahityasrujan ke mul main rajshray dwaara poshit dharmanirpekshata kii pravriti spasht rup se dekhi ja sakati he
 In this period, two Assamese poems were written based on the plots of two Hindi Sufi poetry
 par mulat: yah yug gadhy ke vikaas kaa he
 Like the literature of many other provincial languages, the beginning of the modern period is associated with English rule in Assamese
 1826 i
 assam main angreji shashan ke prarambh kii tithi he
 In this era, the suppression of indigenous sentiments and social inequality mainly inspired the writers
 idhar 1838 i
 se hi videshi mishnariyon ne bhi apana kaary prarambh kiya or janata main dharmprachaar kaa madhyam asamiya ko hi banaaya
 As a result, in the development of Assamese language, printing and publication in a systematic manner operated by these missionaries also helped at one level
 angreji shashan ke yug main angreji or europea sahitya ke adhyayan manan se asamiya ke lekhak prabhavit hue
 Some westerns were also adopted through Adarsh bungalow
 is yug ke praarambhik lekhakon main aanandaram tekial phukan kaa naam sabase mahatvapurn he
 Among other authors, the names of Hemachandra Barua, Gunabhiram Barua and Satyanash Boda are notable

 These authors were Chandrakumar Aggarwal, Lakshminath Bezbarua and Hemchandra Goswami

 By gradually making this magazine a center, a literary community arose, later called the Jonaki Group

 Lakshminath Bezbarua was a versatile genius among these writers of the early 20th century
 unka "asamiya saahityer chaaneki" naamak sankalan vishesh prasiddh he
 In Assamese literature, he introduced a common form between the story and the fine essay
 bejbarua kii hasyaras kii rachanaaon ko kaaphi lokapriyata mili
 That is why he was given the title of "rasraj"
 is yug main anya kaviyon main kamalakant bhattacharya, raghunatha choudhary, nalinibala devi, ambikagiri raichaudhuri, phukan aadi kaa krititv mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 The poems of Mafizuddin Ahmed are inspired by Sufi Dharmasadhana
 gadhy, vishesh rup se kathasahitya, ke kshetra main 19veen shatabdi ke ant main do lekhak padyanath gosai barua tathaa rajnikant bardolai apane aitihaasik upanyaason tathaa naatakon ke liye mahatvapurn samajhe jate hai
 Among the prose authors who produced literature parallel to the Jonaki community, the names of Venudhar Rajkhowa and Sharachandra Goswami are particularly notable
 sharachchandra goswami kii pratibha vaise to bahumukhi thi, par unki khyaati pramukhat: kahaniyon ko lekar he
 In the field of story, Lakshmidhar Sharma, Bina Barua, Krishna Bhuyan etc
 made some experiments of new ideas related to love
 lakshminath phukan apni hasyaras kii kahaniyon ke liye smaraneey hai
 Apart from Kathasahthya, the work of Atulchandra Hazarika and Jyotiprasad Agarwal is more important in the field of drama
 samiksha tathaa shodh kii drushti se ambikanath bara, vanikant kakati, kaliram medhi, viranchi barua tathaa dimbeshwar niyog kaa krititv ullekhneey he
 In the modern period of Assamese literature, the medium of journal magazines also became quite popular
 inamen se "arunoday", "jonaki", "boli", "aavahan", "jayanti", tathaa "pachhova" ne vibhinn kshetron main kaaphi upyogi kaary kiya he
 a new type of literature has been created, mainly by making "ramdhenu" the center
 is yug main paashchaatya prabhaav adhik swasth tathaa santulit rup main aae hai
 Elliot and his associate English poets have primarily inspired new Assamese writers
 keval kavita main hi nahin, kathasahitya tathaa naatak main bhi in nae prayogon kii pravriti dekhi ja sakati he
 New problems have been raised by both sociological and psychological problems
 unke shilp sambandhi prayog bhi kam mahatvapurn nahin hai
 The literature-interest-richness of ancient Assam can be traced back to the then copper plates
 isi prakaar vahaan ke pustakotpaadan ke sambandh main bhi ek pracheen ullekh miltaa he, jiske anusaar kumaar bhaskaravarman ne apane mitra kannaujasamrat harshavardhan ko sundar lipi main likhi hui anek pustakan bhent kii thim
 One of these books was probably a compilation of proverbs and idioms prevalent in the then Assam
 bahut pracheen kaal se hi assam main sangitpriyata kii parampara chalati aa rahi he
 As a result of this, there are virtually many folk songs presented by unwritten and unknown writers in modern Assam, which have been preserved from oral tradition from one generation to the next
 ye logageet dharmik avasaron, achaaron tathaa rituon ke paritarwanon se sambhddha hai
 In some folklore, stories of prince heroes are also found
 shisht sahitya ke udbhav ke purv is kaal main darshanik dak kaa mahatv asaadhaaran he
 His statements have been called Vedavakya
 dakvachanon kii yah parampara bengal tathaa bihar tak milti he
 Almost every family of Assam used to have a handwritten compilation of these postalogies till some time back
 assam ke pracheen naam "kamrup" se prakat hota he ki vahaan bahut pracheen kaal se tantra mantra kii parampara rahi he
 There are many types of mantras related to these Guhyachars, which give some introduction to the initial stage of language and literature
 "charyaapad" ke lekhak sidhon main se kai kaa kamrup se ghanisht sambandh bataaya jaataa he, jo is pradesh kii tantric parampara ko dekhte hue kaaphi swaabhaavik jaan padataa he
 Thus oral literature from the time of Chariyapada to the 13th century is either of popular folk songs and folk songs or of proverbs and mantras

 Baiju Bawra was the Dhrupadgayak of India
 unako baijnath prasad or baijnath mishra ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 He was the court singer of Raja Mansingh of Gwalior and a contemporary of Tansen, the great singer of Akbar's court
 unke jivan ke bare main bahut si kinvadantiyaan hai jinaki aitihaasik rup se pushti nahin kii ja sakati he
 Gurubhai Pandit Baijnath of the great 16th-century singer musician Tansen was born into a Brahmin family in Chanderi in 1542 on the night of Sharad Purnima
 pandit baijnath kii balykaal se hi gayan evam sangeet main kaafii ruchi thi
 The sweetness of his throat and the cleverness of singing were impressive
 pandit baijnath ko bachapan main log pyaar se 'baiju' kahkar pukaarte the
 With the age of Baiju, his singing and music also increased
 jab baiju yuva hue to nagar kii kalavati naamak yuvati se unka prem prasang hua
 Kalavati was an inspiration as well as Baiju's beloved
 sangeet or gayan ke saath-saath baiju apni preyasi ke pyaar main pagal ho gaye
 This is why people started calling him Baiju Bawra
 baijnath ne dhrupad style main gayan kii diksha us samay ke mashhoor guru haridas swami se vrundavan main grahan kii thi
 According to historical books preserved at Jai Vilas Mahal in Gwalior, Baiju could burn oil lamps by singing raga lamps, making ragas by singing raga megh, megh malhar, or gaur malhar, feeding flowers by singing raga bahar and even raga Stones could also be melted by singing Malkons
 samraat akbar sangeet evam kala kaa premi tha
 There was a flow of musicians and litterateurs in his court
 tansen akbar ke darbar ke nau ratnon main gine jate the
 Akbar organized a music competition in his court
 is pratiyogita kii yah shart thi ki tansen se jo bhi muqaabala kar jitegaa, vah akbar ke darbar kaa sangeetkaar bana diya jaayegaa tathaa haare hue pratiyogi ko mrityudand diya jayega
 No musician came forward due to this condition but Baiju Bawra took this pledge and took orders from his Guru Haridas and participated in the music competition
 antat is pratiyogita main baiju kii haar hui, kintu baad main akbar ne prasann hokar baiju ko apane darbar main rakhane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 But according to Akbar's court historians Abul Fazl and Aurangzeb's court historian Faqirullah, Baiju had defeated Tansen in the competition and Tansen touched the feet of Baiju and begged for his life
 baiju ne tansen ko maaf kar diya or khud gwalior waapas chalaa gaya
 Baiju Bawra came to Gwalior instead of staying in Akbar's court, where he was informed that his Guru Haridas was going to be in the tomb
 ve apane guru ke antim darshanon ke liye vrindavan pahunche or unke darshan karne ke pashchaat vibhinn prakaar kii aapadaaon kaa saamana karte hue apane jivan ke antim padaav main kashmir naresh kii rajdhani srinagar pahunche
 At that time his disciple Gopal Nayak was a court singer there
 fatehaal baiju ne apane aane kii soochna gopaldaas tak pahunchane ke liye dwarpal se kaha, to dwarpal ne do took jawaab diya ki unke swami kaa koi guru nahin he
 Hearing this, Baiju was shocked and reached a temple in Srinagar and started singing the raga Dhrupad
 baiju ke shreshth gayan ko sunakar apaar bheed umadane lagi
 When the news of Baiju reached the King of Kashmir, he himself came there and welcomed Baiju and brought it to his court
 kashmir naresh ne gopaldaas ko punah sangeet shiksha die jane hetu baiju se nivedan kiya
 With the permission of the king, he trained Gopal again by teaching him music
 ek anya dantakatha ke anusaar gopal nayak baiju kaa priy shishy tha
 He left Baiju with his wife Prabha and went elsewhere for a livelihood due to which Baiju lost his temper and got his name Baiju Bawra
 gopal nayak kashmir naresh ke darbar main gayak niyukt ho gaya or vahaan usne yah prachlit kar diya ki vah swa-shikshit he or us par kisi bhi guru kii krupa nahin he
 Hearing this, Baiju reached Srinagar and fascinated everyone with his singing, but Gopal Nayak refused to recognize his guru
 aahat baiju ek mandir main jaakar gaanaa gane laga or vahaan baari bheed umad padi or jab kashmir naresh ko is baat kii soochna mili to kashmir naresh ne baiju ko apane darbar main bulavaa bheja or baiju or gopal kii sangeet pratiyogita rakhwa daali
 Baiju got a chance to sing first and Gopal had to answer
 baiju ne raag bhimpalasi gaaya jiske kaaran pathar pighalane lage
 Gopal sang to the north but could not win
 pratiyogita kii shart ke anusaar haarane vaale ko mrityudand diya janaa tha lekin baiju baavaraa ne raja se anurodh kar gopal ko mrityudand se bachaa liya
 But Gopal had to lose his life due to his stupidity
 uskaa antim sanskaar satluj ke kinare uski putree mira ne kiya
 It is said that after the cremation, when Gopal's bones were thrown into the river, she drowned
 dantakatha ke anusaar gopal kii vidhwaa prabhaa ne jab baiju se un haddiyon ko laane kaa anurodh kiya to baiju ne gopal kii putree mira ko raag malhaar kaa ek nayaa sanskaran sikhaaya jisko ek saptaah tak seekhney ke baad jab mira ne satluj ke kinare bheed ke saamne jab gaaya to gopal kii haddiyaan nadi ke kinare aa lageen
 Since that time, that raga has been given the name of Meera's Malhar

 The Yellow River as its basin is called the "cradle of Chinese civilization" - in particular, the Wei Valley long cut into the Orthodox loop - that was the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization and the most prosperous region in early Chinese history
 However, often destructive floods and sometimes above the level of its surrounding areas, the course change created by the frequent elevation of the river bed also earned it the undesirable name "china's misery" and "the crisis of the son of Han
" aajeevik yaa ‘aajeevak’, duniya kii pracheen darshan parampara main bhartiya jameen par viksit hua pehla naastikwaadi or bhautikwaadi sampradaay tha
 According to the scholars of Indian philosophy and history, the Ajivak sect was founded by Makkhali Gosal
 isapurv 5veen sadi main 24wein jain tirthankar mahavir or mahatma buddha ke ubhaar ke pehle yah bhartiya bhu-bhaag par prachlit sabase prabhaavshaalee darshan tha
 Scholars have identified the philosophy of aajeevak sect as 'fatalism'

 aajeevik shabd ke arth ke vishay main vidwaanon main vivaad rahaa hai kintu aajeevik ke vishay main vichaar rakhanevaale shramanon ke varg ko yah arth vishesh maanya rahaa he
 It is believed that the Ajivik sect was the most popular and prominent among the many Shramana sects which rose in the pre-buddhist era in opposition to Vedic beliefs
 itihaaskaaron ne nirvivaad rup se aajeevak sampradaay ko darshanik-dharmik parampara main duniya kaa sabase pehla sangathit sampradaay mana he
 Because there is no evidence of any other organized philosophical tradition before the livelihoods
 mahavir or buddha jarur makali gosaal ke samakaleen the par unke jain or buddha darshan kaa vikaas evam vistaar aajeevak darshan ke pashchaat hi hua
 Since the authentic literature of the Ajivak sect is not available, historians have been completely dependent on Buddhist and Jain literature and Mauryugyan inscriptions for information about the philosophy and history of the livelihoods
 baavjood iske itihaaskaaron main is baat ko lekar koi mataiky nahin he ki is sampradaay kaa prabhaav or prachlan pehali sadi tak sampurna bharat main vyapak taur par tha
 Scholars are clear that both Jain and Buddhist philosophies developed and developed later are not free from its influence

 Historians believe that in the medieval period this sect lost its segregation
 jain or buddha shastron ne aajeevikon ke tirthankar ke rup main makkhali gosaal kaa ullekh karte hue unhen buddha or mahavir kaa prabal virdohi ghoshit kiya he
 It is known from the jain-buddhist scriptures that Makkhali Gosal was the only Tirthankara to organize and popularize livelihood
 gosaal chitra ke jariye dharmik-naitik upadesh dekar jeevika chalaane vaale mankh ke putr the
 His mother's name was Bhadra
 makali kaa janm goshaala main hua tha
 With this, 'gosal' was associated with his name
 jain parampara ke anusaar ‘makali’ ‘mankh’ se bana he
 Mankh was a community whose members lived like the Charan or Bhat
 jain sahitya ke anusaar makali haath main murti lekar bhatka karte the
 That's why Jains and Buddhists have called him 'makkhaliputt Goshal'
 pracheen granthon main unhen ‘muscari goshaal’ bhi kaha gaya he kyonki aajeevak shraman haath main ‘muscari’ liye rahete the
 Gosal called himself the twenty-fourth Tirthankara
 gosaal shraman parampara se aae the kyonki jain-buddha granthon main unke pehle ke kai aajeevikon kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Before Makkhali, the names of two prominent Ajivikas named Kisanki and Nandavachha are found
 bhagwati sutara ke aathven shatak ke paanchaven uddeshak main mahavir ne 12 aajeevikon ke naam bhi aae hai jo is prakaar hai: taal, talpalamb, uvvih, sanvih, avviha, udai, naamuday, nmuday, anuvalay, sankhuvalay, ayampul or kaayray
 According to Jainagam Bhagwati, 'goshalak was also a practitioner of the instrument of scripture

 manki rishi kaa mul drushtikon nirved yaa jaisaa patanjali ne kaha he shaanti parak tha, arthath apane haath-pair se kuch na karnaa
 This was exactly the opposite of Paninism

 The Jain Prakrit form was Mankhali

 Mankali is definitely another form of peace festival

 There is ample evidence that the above five had gained considerable prestige, popularity and public support long before Mahavira's 'jin' or 'kaivalya' and Buddha attained enlightenment, or long before he became famous
 darshan or itihaas ke vidwaanon ne aajeevak darshan ko ‘niyatwaad’ kaha he
 According to Ajivikas, the world cycle is fixed, it finishes in its own order and performs liberation

 According to him, all human beings are subject to destiny

 aajeevikon ke bare main hamaare paas praathmik saret kii jaankaree bilkul nahin he
 Therefore, it would be a grave mistake to consider the philosophy of Ajivikas as 'fatalism' 'mandarinism' or 'fatalism' based on jain-buddhist texts
 aajeevik log apni jeevika yaa pesha karte hue shraman bane hue the isliye unhen kisi bhi surat main ‘karm’ kaa virdohi nahin kaha ja saktaa

 The Gregorian calendar {gregorian calendar} is a calendar used almost everywhere in the world
 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method
 is paddati ko bhinn-bhinn isai deshon main bhinn-bhinn varshon main sweekaar kiya gaya
 From this it is necessary to keep this in mind while reading the history of these countries
 is naveen paddati ko italy, france, spain or portugal ne 1582 i0 main, prashia, germany ke roman catholic pradesh switzraland, holland or flanders ne 1583 i0 main, poland ne 1586 i0 main, hungary ne 1587 i0 main, germany or netherland ke protestant pradesh tathaa denmark ne 1700 i0 main, british samrajya ne 1752 i0 main, japan ne 1972 i0 main china ne 1912 i0 main, bulgaria ne 1915 i0 main, turki or soviet rus ne 1917 i0 main tathaa yugoslavia or romania ne 1919 i0 main apanaaya
 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day

 Philosophy can achieve the certainty of mathematics only if it does not accept any notion which is not self-proven

 Decart's interpretation was new, but like the ancestors, his affection was also in philosophy
 jon lock ne apane liye nayaa maarg chunaa
 There has been controversy about the truth for centuries
 pehle to yah jaananaa aavashyak he ki hamaare gyaan kii pahunch kahan tak he
 These questions were also related to what is knowledge and how to get it
 europe mahadweep ke darshanikon ne darshan ko ganit kaa praturup dena chaha tha, lock ne apana dhyaan manovigyaan kii ore pheraa "maanav buddhi par niabandh" kii rachana kii
 This epochal book proved to be, it is considered to be the foundation of empiricism
 george barkale ne lock kii aalochana main "maanavgyan" ke niyam likhakar anubhavvaad ko aage badhaayaa or david hum ne "maanav prakruti" main ise charam seemaa tak pahunchaa diya
 The special significance of Hume's ideas is that he opened the way to Kant's "criticalism"
 kaant ne gyanamimasaa ko darshanashastra kaa kendriya prashn bana diya
 But it took a long time for Jnanamimamsa to get proper position in the west
 bharat main kabhi isaki upeksha hui hi nahin
 In the first Sutras in Gautama's Nyasutras, 16 thinkers have been described, whose real knowledge leads to the attainment of free Shreyas
 inamen pratham do vishay "pramaan" or "prameya" hai
 These are both knowledge and knowledge
 yah ullekhneey he ki in donon main bhi pratham sthaan "pramaan" ko diya gaya he
 Knowledge, the knower and the known are concerned
 dekart ne apane anubhav ke vishleshan se aarambh kiya, parantu manushya saamaajik praani he, uskaa anubhav shunya main nahin viksit hota
 The history of philosophy is a story of debate
 plato ne apana mat sanvaadon main vyakt kiya
 The existence of more than one consciousness is accepted in dialogue
 gyanamimasaa main vivechan kaa vishay vaiyaktik chetana nahin, apitu saamaajik chetana ban jaati he
 Knowledge has its own undeniable existence, but it also contains the following acknowledgments - k
 gyaan se bhinn gyaata he, jise gyaan hota he
 B
 Knowledge is the result of contact with more than one knowledgeable person
 ga
 gyaan kaa vishay gyaan se bhinn he
 Each assumption claims to be true
 parantu mimasaa is daawey ko uchit jaanch ke bina sweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 We will examine these assumptions now, but first it is necessary to say something about the nature of knowledge
 gyanamimasaa main pramukh prashn ye hai- Nature of knowledge: Consent, belief and knowledge When we listen to a thought or think about it, our attitude in that regard is as follows - sweekruti ke kai str hote hai
 There is occasional acceptance at the lowest level, it is called consent
 yah sweekruti pramanit nahin hoti, ise tyaagna pade to hamen koi virakti nahin hoti
 With consent, sharpness and liveliness prevail
 dharmik vishwaason par jamen rahane ke liye manushya har prakaar kaa ksht sahan kar letaa he
 Both faith and consent are personal works, knowledge does not have this limitation
 main yah nahin kahata ki meri sanmati main do or do chaar hote hai, na yah kahata hoon ki mere vishwaas ke anusaar, yadi k or kha donon ga ke baraabar hai to ek duusare ke bhi baraabar hai
 These are such facts, which every intelligent creature must accept, there is a difference in consents, knowledge is one for all
 gyaan main sanmati kii atmparakta kaa sthaan vastuparakata le leti he
 According to empiricism, there are only two parts of the material - effects and their images
 dravya ke liye inamen koi gyaan nahin
 Hume said that just as physical matter is nothing but a conglomerate, similarly nothing but a group of experienced experiences
 in donon samoohon main ek bhed he -- kul ke sabhi gun ek saath vidyaman hote hai, chetan kii chetnavasthaayen ek duusare ke baad prakat hoti hai
 Consciousness is a category or line and no line can be perceived to be a row by itself
 hriday kii vyakhya main samaran shakti ke liye koi sthaan nahin; jaise wiliam james ne kaha, anubhavvaad ko smriti maangani padati he
 Hume did not find the knowledgeable material; He could not be found there
 anubhavvaad ke liye prashn tha -- anubhav kya bataata he? peeche kaant ne poocha -- anubhav banataa kaise he? anubhav anbhavi kii kriya ke bina ban hi nahin saktaa
 Man is a social animal; Our whole life and lives with humans
 purushabahutv vyapak sweekruti he
 The question for epistemology is, is this acceptance a state of conviction or knowledge? Dreams are a cause for doubt in this matter
 swapn main main dekhtaa sunata prathit hota hoon; anya manushyon ke saath sansarg bhi hota prathit hota he
 Is awakening and dreaming also a dream? According to egoism, the whole power is a heavy fantasy
 hamaara saamaajik jivan ahamvaad kaa khandan he, parantu prashn to saamaajik jivan ke sambandh main hi he -- kya yah jivan vishwaas maatr hi to nahin? ahamvaad ke viruddh koi aisa pramaan nahin jise akhandaneey kah saken
 When we suffer from such doubt then, as Hume has said, after a short time we find ourselves exhausted and our attention is forced to turn to the world, which also contains material things and conscious beings
 jab buddhi kaam nahin karti, prakruti hamaari sahaayta karti he
 According to empiricism, all knowledge is made up of influences and pictures in the end
 prabhaav main gunbodh or vastuwaad kaa bhed kar sakate hai; chitra main pratibimb or pratyay kaa bhed hota he
 Every knowledge center recognizes a particular quality - eye form, ear word, nose smell
 in gunon ke samanvay se vastugyan praapt hota he
 It is also called Pratibodh or Pratishtha
 aise bodh main gyaan kaa vishay gyaata ke baahar hota he; pratibimb or pratyay andar hote hai
 Whether the distinction between outside and inside is just fiction or fact, it has been a major question in Jnanamimamsa
 pratibodh yaa pratyaksh gyaan ne jitna dhyaan aakarshith kiya he, utana gyanamimasaa main kisi anya prashn ne nahin kiya
 According to the Sankhya philosophy, there are two main signs of the direct - pratyaksh indriya or vishay ke sampark kaa parinaam hota he
 In a direct way, the mind takes the shape of the subject
 iskaa arth yah he ki pratyaksh gyaan kalpanamaatr nahin hota or isamen kisi prakaar kii bhranti nahin hoti
 It is clear that we do not have more reliable knowledge than direct, but the question is whether there can be direct contact between the subject and the subject
 yadi aisa sampark hota he, to bhranti kaise pravisht ho jaati he? vishayi or vishay main kuch antar hota he
 The condition of this difference affects our perception
 jangal ke vriksh dur se harenhin dikhte, kyonki unke rang ke saath bich main padanevaali vaayu kaa rang bhi mil jaataa he
 Then, the state of our senses is not the same, the ear patient sees things yellow
 kuch vichaarak kehete hai ki ham bahya padaarthon ko nahin dekhte, unke chitron ko dekhte hai, in chitron ke vishay main nishchaypurvak nahin kah sakate ki ye bahya padaarthon ke anuroop hai; yahan bhranti kii sambhaavna sadaa bani rahati he
 There are two forms of realism - reflective realism and reflective realism
 pehle rup main bhranti kaa astitv samasya ban jaataa he, duusare rup main satya gyaan kaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 Cynicism eliminates the difference between inside and outside
 jaan lock ke vichaaron main hi iskaa beej vidyaman tha
 He said that the suffix of the substance is unclear
 usne yah bhi kaha ki bhautik padaarthon ke pradhan gun to unamem vidyaman hote hai, parantu apradhan gun ve parinaam hai jo pradhan gunon ke aghat se hamaare man main vyakt hote hai
 Berkeley said that the tips which are given against the objective existence of the secondary qualities, are given against the principal properties
 baahar kuch he hi nahin, uske bodh ke spasht yaa aspasht hone kaa prashn pratyay ban gaya he
 The senses are not qualities of external substances, nor are they mental states
 ye gyaata se bhinn, uske baahar hai or unka swatantra astitv he
 According to Rassala, there exist groups of "senses", some parts of them are acquired
 hamaara paribodh satya gyaan he, parantu aanshik gyaan
 Kant started his famous book "critique of Pure Wisdom" with these words - "is baat main to andeh hi nahin ho saktaa ki hamaara sara gyaan anubhav ke saath aarambh hota he
 Because how is it possible that perception power starts doing something, except that the substances that affect our senses give it this ability
 parantu yadhyapi hamaara sara gyaan anubhav ke saath aarambh hota he, isse yah nishkarsh nahin nikalataa ki sara gyaan anubhav kii hi dein he
 Kant emphasized the contribution of intelligence to the design of experience
 aisa karne par bhi, usne aarambh main kaha ki hamaara vichaar prakatano kii duniya se pare nahin ja saktaa
 Back, he distinguished between the perceptive intellect and practical intelligence, and said that the transcendent intellect gives knowledge, but this knowledge is power beyond the world of manifestations
 manushya sarabhoot rup main naitik praani he
 The demands of the policy are - bharat main para vidya or aparaa vidya main bhed kiya gaya he or donon main pratham ko unchaa pad diya he
 Some thinkers call Apara Vidya as Avidya only
 plato ne vishesh padaarthon ke bodh ko sammati kaa pad diya or sammati ko vidya or avidya ke madhya main rakhaa
 Every decision claims to be true
 is daawey kaa arth kya he? The decision involves the relation of two suffixes or ideas
 yadi yah sambandh un padaarthon main bhi vidyaman he jo un vichaaron ke mul hai, to nirnay satya he
 This solution of truth is called conformism
 vigyaanavaad bahya jagat ko kalpana maatr kahata he, iske anusaar satta main chetnaaon or chetan avasthaaon ke atirikt kuch bhi nahin he
 If a decision can be connected to the rest of knowledge, it is true
 yah avirodhwaad he
 Pragmatism has spread in America during the modernism period
 iske anusaar, jo dharna vyavhaar main safal siddh hoti he, vah satya he
 Truth is not a permanent thing that we see; It is made
 vastav main yahan do prashn hai -- satya kaa swaroop kya he? kisi dharna ke satya hone kii kasuti kya he? anurupatavaad pehle prashn kaa uttar detaa he tathaa avirodhwaad or vyavahaarwad duusare prashn kaa

 According to Devanagari, other South Asians, south-east Asians, Tibetans, and according to some, the Korean script was also developed from this
 ithiopian lipi par brahmi lipi kaa spasht prabhaav he
 Until now, the Brahmi script was believed to have been developed by the Mauryans in the fourth to third centuries BCE, but recent excavations from the Archaeological Survey of India have shown that it existed in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka since the 6th century BCE
 kai vidwaanon kaa mat he ki yah lipi pracheen saraswati lipi se nikali, atah yah purvavarti rup main bharat main pehle se prayog main thi
 After the removal of Saraswati script, Brahmi script came into vogue for writing Prakrit language
 brahmi lipi main sanskrit me zyada kuch aisa nahin likhaa gaya jo samay kii maar jhel sake
 Buddhist teachings of Mauryan Emperor Ashoka written in Prakrit / Pali language are still safe
 isi liye shaayad yah bhram upann hua ki is kaa vikaas mauryon ne kiya
 This script was written in the same way from left to right as the scripts of today
 lalitvistar main lipiyon ke jo naam ginaae gaye hai, unamem 'brahmalipi' kaa naam bhi mila he
 The earliest form of this script is found only in the inscriptions of Ashoka
 baudhon ke pracheen granth 'lalitvistar' main jo un 64 lipiyon ke naam ginaae gaye hai jo buddha ko sikhaai gai, unamem 'nagari lipi' naam nahin he, 'brahmi lipi' naam hai
 'lalitwistar' was translated into Chinese in AD 308
 jainon ke 'pannavna sutara' or 'samavayang sutara' main 18 lipiyon ke naam die hai jinamein pehla naam bambhi he
 His Bhagavatisutra begins with 'namo Bambhiye Libiyye'
 sabase pracheen lipi bharatvarsh main ashok kii pai jaati he jo sindh nadi ke paar ke pradeshon ko chhod bharatvarsh main sarvatra bahudhaa ek hi rup kii milti he
 The script which contains Ashoka's writings is the extracted Brahmi script of ancient Aryans or Brahmins
 jainon ke 'pragyapanaasutra' main likhaa he ki 'ardhamagadhi' bhashaa jis lipi main prakashit kii jaati he vah brahmi lipi he'
 Ardhamagadhi language is the language of the region between Mathura and Pataliputra from which Hindi originated
 atah brahmi lipi madhya aryaavart kii lipi he jisase kramshah us lipi kaa vikaas hua jo peeche 'nagari' kahalaai
 The present form of Nagari is clearly visible in the crooked Magadhi letters of the time of King Adityasena of Magadha
 isa kii 9veen or 10veen shatabdi se to nagari apane purna rup main lagati he
 How the Nagari alphabets are progressively transformed from the letters of the time of Ashoka, has been made clear by Pandit Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha in the book 'ancient Lipimala' and by a map
 kai paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa mat he ki ki bharatvasiyon ne akshar likhnaa videshiyon se siikhaa tathaa brahmilipi bhi usee prakaar pracheen phinician lipi se vyutpann hui he jis prakaar arabi, unani, roman aadi lipiyaan
 But many indigenous scholars have proven that the Brahmi script developed independently in India
 brahmi lipi se udgam hui kuch lipiyaan or unki akruti evam dhwani main samanthaayen spashtatya dekhi ja sakati hai
 Many of these scripts were developed around the time of Christ
 in main se kuch is prakaar hai- Here is a comparative picture of some Indian scripts: vaigyanik namakaran main, paryaay yaa samanaarthi kisi ek varg ke liye prayukt hone vaale alag alag vaigyanik naam hai
