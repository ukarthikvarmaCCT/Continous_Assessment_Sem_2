 Louis Pasteur was a great scientist
 france ke prasiddh vaigyanik lui pasture kaa janm san 1822 i
 In Napoleon Bonaparte had a businessman soldier
 aap bachapan se hi dayaalu prakruti ke the
 During your childhood you saw eight people from the village dying of the mad wolf bite
 unki dardebhari chikhon ko aap bhul nahin sake the
 Even in puberty, when this past incident took place on the table, you used to get restless
 par aap padhane-likhane main vishesh tej nahin the
 Still, there were two qualities in you, which are necessary for success in science - curiosity and endurance
 yuvavastha main aapane likhaa tha ki shabdkosh main teen shabd atyant mahatvapurn hai: ichhashakti, kaam tathaa safalataa
 After finishing college, started working in a chemist to achieve his goal
 yahan par aapane crystalon kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa kuch mahatvapurn anusandhan bhi kiye
 You got good fame in the form of chemicals from them
 san 1849 i
 In France, the Minister of Education appointed you to teach physics in the school of Dijon
 ek varsh baad aap strwsburg vishvavidhyalay main rasayan vigyaan kaa sthanapann praadhyaapak bana die gaye
 The secret of this advancement was that the university president had a girl whose name was mine
 meri shyaamal keshon vaali sundar kishori thi
 You met him meri kaa achoota lavanya aapke hryday main ghar kar gaya
 Only a week after the meeting, you proposed marriage to Mary
 meri ne aapke prastaav ko thukraa diya
 But Louis Pasteur was a good scientist
 dhirajata aap main thi
 You continued to try despite Mary's refusal
 ek varsh ke baad aapako apni ichha purti main safalataa mili
 Mary accepted to be your wife
 vivaah ke uparant aapaki ruchi rasayan vigyaan se hat kar jeevigyaan kii ore agrasar hone lag gai
 This is the science of organisms
 yah vishvavidhyalay france ke angoor utpaadak kshetra ke madhya main he
 One day a group of wine makers came to meet Louis Pasteur
 unhone aap se poocha ki har varsh hamaari sharaab khatti ho jaati he
 What is the reason for this? lui pasture ne apane sookshmdarshi yantra dwaara madiraa kii pariksha karne main ghanton bitaa die
 In the end you found that very young creatures called bacteria sour the wine
 ab aapane pataa lagaaya ki yadi madiraa ko 20-30 minute tak 60 centegrade par garam kiya jaataa he to ye jeevanu nasht ho jate hai
 The heat is lower than the boiling temperature
 isse madiraa ke swaad par koi prabhaav nahin padataa he
 Later you used the same principle to keep the milk sweet and pure
 yahi doodh 'pascharit doodh' kehalaata he
 One day Louis Pasteur realized that if these tiny bacteria are in foods and liquids, they can also be in the blood of living animals and people
 ve beemaari paidaa kar sakate hai
 At the same time, there was a terrible epidemic in chickens of France called 'chuja's Cholera'
 lakhon chuje mar rahe the
 The henkeepers prayed for you to help us
 aapane us jeevanu kii khoj shuru kar di jo chuujon main haija failaa rahaa tha
 You see those bacteria floating around in the blood of dead chicks
 aapane is jeevanu ko durbal banaaya or injection ke madhyam se swasth chuujon kii deh main pahunchaaya
 This did not cause the chickens with vaccine cholera
 aapane tikaa lagane kii vidhi kaa avishkaar nahin kiya par chuujon ke haije ke jeevanuon kaa pataa laga liya
 After this Louis Pasteur made a vaccine for cows and sheep for the disease called anthrax: but you could not do them well after getting the disease: but you succeeded in preventing the disease from happening
 aapane bhedon ke durbal kiye hue enthraiks jeevanuon kii sui lagaai
 It used to be that the sheep had very mild anthrax; But he was so mild that he never fell ill and after that he would never get that fatal disease
 aap or aapke sahyogiyon ne maason france main ghumkar sahasron bhedon ko yah sui lagaai
 This protected the French cow and sheep industry
 aapane tarah-tarah ke sahasron prayog kar daale
 Many of them were also dangerous
 aap vifaille virus vaale bhayanak kutton par kaam kar rahe the
 So, you solved this problem
 aapane thode se vifaille virus ko durbal banaaya
 Then he prepared the vaccine for this virus
 is tike ko aapane ek swasth kute kii deh main pahunchaaya
 After applying the fourteen vaccines, he was protected against rabies
 aapaki yah khoj badi mahatvapurn thi; par aapane abhi maanav par iskaa prayog nahin kiya tha
 In 1885 AD
 kii baat he
 Louis Pasteur was sitting in his laboratory
 ek francisi mahila apane nau varshiya putr jojeff ko lekar unke paas pahaunchi
 The child was bitten by a rabid dog two days ago
 pagal kute kii laar main nanhe jeevanu hote hai jo rabies virus kehalaate hai
 If nothing is done, nine-year-old Jozef will slowly die from suffering from hydrotherapy
 aapane balak jojeff kii pariksha kii
 Perhaps some way to save him can be done
 bahut varshon se aap is baat kaa pataa lagane kaa prayaas kar rahe the ki jalasantras ko kaise roka jaae? aap is rog se vishesh rup se ghrinaa karte the
 Now the question was whether the boy should dare to apply needle on Josephine's rabies vaccine
 balak kii mrityu kii sambhaavna thi
 But his death is certain even after the needles are planted
 is duvidha main aapane tatkaal nirnay liya or balak jojeff kaa upachaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 For ten days, you kept applying the increasing amount of vaccine of the child Joseph and then a great surprise occurred
 balak jojeff ko jalasantras nahi hua
 On the contrary, he started getting better
 itihaas main pratham baar maanav ko jalasantras se bachaane ke liye sui lagaai gai
 You really gave this unique gift to mankind
 aapke deshavaasiyon ne aapako sab sammaan evam sab padak pradaan kiye
 He built the Pasteur Institute in honor of you: but Kirti and Aishwarya did not change you
 aap jeevanaparyant tak sadaiv rogon ko roak kar pidaa haran ke upayon kii khoj main lage rahe
 In 1895 AD main aapaki nixravastha main hi mrityu ho gai

 ha sanjay singhania, shahar ke namjad vyapaaree jo soochnanusaar ghatanottar smriti lop se peedit hai, kii vilakshan vastu-sthiti kii jaanch padtaal karnaa chaahati he
 His professor refuses access to Sanjay's recording as all his criminal facts are currently being investigated
 iske baavjood sunita is jaanch ko khud hi anjaam dene kaa faisla karti he
 Sanjay is shown brutally killing another person
 vah us vyakti kii tasviir khinchataa he or samay tathaa tithi ke saath 'nishpadit' kii muhar apane note main laga detaa he
 It is shown that Sanjay has a peculiar disease of post-operative memory loss in which his memory disappears after every 15 minutes
 sanjay khinchi gai tasviren, note kar lenaa evam badan par gudwaaye godane kii paddatiyon kaa prayog har 15 minute ke chakra ke baad apni yaaddaasht ko phir se lautne ke liye karata he
 Every morning when Sanjay goes to the toilet, he sees a note written "take off the shirt" near the faucet of the wash basin
 jaise hi vah kameez utaarata he apane chaude seene par godane kii ek shrinkhalaa dekhtaa he
 When he sees "kalpana was murdered" anal, it is revealed from one end that Sanjay is finally ready to avenge Kalpana's murder and that's why he supposedly goes one by one to those people Who were responsible for the death of Kalpana
 likhe hue nots or gude hue godanon se yah saafe saboot miltaa he ki uskaa mukhya nishaanaa gajani he
 After all, it is also clear that Ghazni is a famous social personality of the city, but no one else
 mumbai police nireekshak arjuna yadav serial hatyaon ke sangeen maamle kii chaanbin se jude hai
 They find Sanjay and find him in his flat and attack him and cripple him
 arjuna yadav tasveeron or likhit nots ke vyapak set ko dekhakar hairaan ho jate hai
 He finds two diaries in which the events of 2005 and 2006 are sequentially scripted
 jaise hi inspector yadav 2005 kii diary padhate he film 2005 ke purv drishy main pravesh karti he
 Sanjay Singhania is a person of distinguished merchant descent who owns the Air Voice Telephone Company
 videsh main usne apni shiksha-diksha samaapt kar lee he or lautakar apane parivaar ke vyavsaay ko sambhaal liya he
 In the course of his business, Sanjay sends his employees to meet a combative actress / model Kalpana and talk about placing a huge advertisement board of Air Voice over her apartment
 kalpana kii modling / vigyaapan company kaa maalik ise ek romance kaa chakkar samajhane kii bhul kar baithta he or kalpana ko yah prastaav manjuur kar lene ko protsaahit karata he
 He promotes her as the lead model
 kalpana aamtaur par pyaari or rahamdil he
 She accepts this as an innocent prank and thus begins a dramatic game full of riddles as Sanjay's girlfriend
 aakhirkaar sanjay kalpana se miltaa he lekin vah usase kahata he ki vah sachin he or nai jindagi kii talash main chote qasbe se nikal kar bade shahar main aayaa ek adana insaan he
 Kalpana gives her minor tasks of modeling
 dhire-dhire vah uske sammohan main uski ore khinchi chali jaati haior sachin bhi uski saumyata, saadagi or karunaa main bah jaataa he
 They fall in love with each other and Sanjay finally gets the courage to propose marriage to her
 vah uske prastaav par vichaar karne ke liye kuch samay maangati he
 Sanjay maintains that if she accepts his offer, he will reveal his true identity to her; And if she rejects, he will quietly return without harming her
 film kii kahani phir vartmaan main laut jaati he; jab yadav 2006 kii diary padhne lagata he
 Sanjay suddenly arrives, attacking Yadav and tying him up
 vah gajani ko ek college ke samaaroh main khoj nikaalata he jahaan vah sammanneey pradhan atithi he
 Sanjay takes some photographs of Ghajni and decides to kill her
 In the same ceremony, he meets Sunita; She also recognizes him by the cover on her file and intends to befriend her
 baad main usee shaam sanjay gajani ke ek gunde ko parking kshetra main maar giraata he
 He starts waiting for Ghazni's arrival but in the end decides to attack him again on some other occasion
 marataa hua ghayal gunda gajani ko do saal pehle ghati ek ghatana kii yaad dilaataa he jisame kalpana kii hatya kar di gai thi or sanjay aahat hokar ek mariz ban gaya tha
 Ghajni gets confused and fails to remember anything
 is bich, sunita sanjay ke flats main aati he or yadav ko petakar bandhaa hua padaa paati he
 He also comes to know that Ghajni is Sanjay's target
 yadav use is baat kii bhi jaankaree detaa he ki sanjay ek janamana serial hatyara he
 Sunita gets two diaries and frees Yadav
 achaanak isi bich sanjay vahaan pahunch jaataa he; use uname se kisi kii yaad nahin aati he or vah unka peechha karata hua baahar nikal jaataa he
 Ultimately Yadav gets hit by a bus and Sunita barely escapes the freak Sanjay
 yah jaankaar ki gajani khatre main he, vah use suchit kar detii hai ki yah sanjay hi he jo uski jaan ke peeche padaa hua he
 Targeting this name, Ghazni arrives at Sanjay's flat with the intention of killing him
 vah uske saare photographs or nots nasht kar detaa he or uske gunde sanjay ko kaabo main kar uske maujuuda godane par punah godwa dete he taaki puraani yaadon ko sanketit karne vaale saare nishaan mit jaaen
 itminan hokar kii puraani yaadon se jodanevaale saare nishaan mitaa die gaye, gajani sanjay ko isi haalat main chhodkar chalaa jaataa he
 Meanwhile, returning to the hostel, Sunita reads the 2006 diary
 film kii kahani phir 2006 ke purv drishy main laut jaati he
 It is shown that Kalpana accepted Sanjay's marriage proposal
 yah diary bhi achaanak samaapt ho jaati he
 Sunita further investigates and discovers that at some point in 2006, Kalpana was inadvertently entangled in a bad web of unsuspecting prostitutes
 railyatra ke dauraan uski bhent 25 nirih bholi bhali kamasin ladakiyon se hui jo dhandhe ke liye mumbai bheji ja raheen thim
 She protects those girls and saves them
 lekin ladkiyaan giroh ke sargana ke rup main gajani kaa naam letin hai
 Ghazni in his own way uses his medium to stop the girls' tongue and Kalpana sets out to find herself
 gajani or uske gunde tod-phod karte hue kalpana ke apartment main ghus jate hai or uske laut aane kii pratiksha karte he jabaki kalpana andar hi mil jaati he
 Coincidentally, Sanjay reached there to meet Kalpana
 kalpana kaa antim uccharit shabd tha "gajani "
 gundon ne kalpana par hamalaa kar diya
 Sanjay was about to intervene when suddenly Ghazni struck his head with an iron rod
 sanjay kii aankhon ke saamne antim drishy kaundh jaataa he, ki gajani ke lohe kii chad ke krur prahaar se hi kalpana kii hatya hui thi
 Sunita now realizes the truth about the shock, she meets Sanjay and tells him what the truth is
 gusse se bekaabu hokar vah ji-jaan se gajani kaa peechha karata he
 Upon reaching Ghazni's den in Mumbai, Sanjay brutally kills all the Ghazni's retainers one by one in a planned manner and falls behind Ghajni
 durdamy dhang se khadedta hua vah uske paas pahunch kar ladaai main bhid jaataa he
 He wants to kill Ghazni so that his memory cycle disappears again and he forgets the present
 gajani mudata he or chura bhonk detaa he
 While mocking Sanjay, he narrates the gruesome tale of how he murdered Kalpana, when suddenly Sanjay overcomes his power with the ultimate boil
 sanjay gajani ko thik usee tarah martha he jis tarah gajani ne kalpana kii hatya kii thi
 The film progresses to its end, with Sanjay still working as a volunteer in an orphanage suffering from a memory loss
 sunita use ek chota-sa uphaar detii he jo ki plaster ke patt par sanjay or kalpana ke dabe qadamon ke nishaan hai jab undonon ne ek nae apartment main pravesh kiya tha - kalpana ke saath uske antarang saahchary kii yaad taaja karne ke liye hi vah aisa karti he
 The decision is left to the audience whether Sanjay's memory returns again or not
