 How was the era of Maharana Pratap? How was the society and culture of that period? During the invasion of Babur, did the greatest power of the country, Mewar, calm down forever? After Sher Shah, Babur's grandson Akbar crossed all limits for the dignity of Mewar, but what was the reason that the flag of Balandi remained in the injured hands of Mewar
 akbar ke koi aadha darjan hamale or abhiyaan tathaa yuddh ke baavjood sari maryaadaayen maharana pratap ke post nahin the
 Kalmanigars such as Abul Fazl and Faizi, day and night, understood their duty as proving the spiritual Peshwa on the ground and were writing reward and attention to every little thing to sell the king, selling their water
 At the same time, Mewar was preparing to save its water
 aatm prashansa main likhane ke naam par pratap ne apane paas kuch nahin mana anyathaa uske darbar main bhi kaai abul fazal or faiji hota
 Do not remember that Pratap had written a book in his praise
 pratap ke jeevankaal main prashansa kii koi pushpika tak nahin milti, haa chakrapani mishra ne jarur ekaadh shloke pratap kii prashansa main likhaa
 Most historians have portrayed Pratap as the warrior defending Akhbar
 mughalon dwaara desh ko ekta ke sutara main baandhne ke iraade kii raah main roda banane vaale vyaktitv ke rup main varnit kiya he
 It is also to the extent that historians have done this work too much, who have not seen Mewar
 kshetreey sroton ko mahatv hi nahin diya
 On the basis of Persian sources, he avoided measuring Pratap's personality
 


 maharana pratap kaa yug kriti kii rachana karte samay maine apana kathorepan barkaraar rakhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 At some point, inerrancy can also be seen, i have avoided sentimentality or impatience

 By editing the Mahurtamala and editing the fourth work Vyavardhana, i found that Pratap had taken unusual personalities

 If inorganic materials are present then some percentage of the entire plant and animal material included in the food should be organic and any inorganically generated material should be subject to various agricultural requirements
 Foods that claim to be organic must be free of artificial food additives and often processed with artificial methods, materials and conditions such as chemical cooking, food irradiation and genetically modified ingredients
 The use of pesticides is permitted only as long as they are not synthetic

 in naatakon main kavi kii kalpana tathaa uske man ke ahlad kaa uttam prakaashan hua he
 The best historical plays were also written at this time
 marlo se prabhavit 'richard dwitiya' usee shrenee kii purvavarti kriti 'richard tritiy' se rachanavinyas main kahin adhik safal he
 Both the parts of 'henry IV' and 'henry V' which are well known historical dramas, are compositions of this period
 shakespeare ke praaia: sabhi sonet jo apni utkrisht abhivyakti ke liye anupam hai, san 1595 ore 1607 ke bich likhe gaye
 The third stage, which ended in about 1607, holds special significance in Shakespeare's life
 in varshon main paariwarik vipatti evam swasthya kii kharabi ke kaaran kavi kaa man avasann tha
 Hence, most of the compositions of these days are sad
 vishwaprasiddh du:khant naatak hamelet, othelo, king lier or makebeth evam roman du:khant naatak julius sijar, 'antony and cleopatra' evam 'coriolenus' isi kalavadhi main likhe gaye or abhinit hue
 'trivialus and Cressida', 'all's well that ends well' and 'major for Major' have a mixed expression of happiness and grief, even then only the tragic part is predominant
 vikaas kii antim avasthaa main shakespeare ne pericules, sinvilin, 'di winters tail', 'di tempast' prabhruti naatakon kaa sarjan kiya, jo sukhaant hone par bhi du:khad sambhaavnaaon se bhare hai evam ek sandhya vaataavaran kii sristi karte hai
 These joyous sorrow plays are termed as romance or Shakespeare's last plays
 shakespeare ke sukhaant naatakon kii apni nijee visheshtaayen hai
 Although Platus is followed in 'the Comedy of Errors', other pleasant dramas are completely different from the ancient classical plays
 inkaa uddeshy prahasan dwaara kurupataaon kaa mitaanaa tathaa trutiyon kaa sudhaar karnaa nahin varan rochak katha or charitrachitran dwaara logon kaa manoranjan karnaa he
 The theme of almost all such plays is such intense feeling of love that spontaneously arises in the minds of young men and women
 premi janon ke maarg main pehle to baadhaayen utpann hoti hai kintu naatak ke ant tak kathinaaiyaan vinasht ho jaati hai or unka parinaam sampann hota he
 In these compositions, there is a poetic and imaginative expression of life and the whole atmosphere is full of joy
 shakespeare kaa parichay katipay ucchwargeey pariwaron se ho gaya tha or unamem jis prakaar kaa jivan unhone dekha usee kaa prakaashan in naatakon main kiya he
 The grief plays highlight the serious problems of human life
 in naatakon ke abhijaat kulotpann nayak kuch samay tak safalataa or unnati ke maarg par agrasar hone ke uparaant yatnaa or vinaash ke shikaar banate hai
 Shakespeare's opinion on the subject of what causes his grief and death is clearly expressed
 nayak kaa durbhaagya anshat: pratikul niyati evam paristhitiyon se udbhoot he, kintu isse kahin bada kaaran uski charitrik durbalata main miltaa he
 In ancient Greek tragedies, the protagonist was only decimated by faulty judgment or flawed attitudes, but, perhaps influenced by Christianity and moralism, Shakespeare placed the principal responsibility for the hero's downfall on his character in his plays
 hamelet, athelo, lier or makebeth - in sabhi ke swabhaav athwa charitra main aisi kami milti he jo unke ksht evam mrityu kaa kaaran banati he
 In these sad plays, dual duality is reflected, internal duality and multi-duality
 aantarik dwandv nayak ke man main, uske vichaaron or bhaawanaaon main utpann hota he or apni tivrata ke kaaran na keval nirnay kathin bana detaa he apitu kuch samay ke liye nayak kaa asul vichlit bhi kar detaa he
 This type of internal duality has led to the emergence of psychological subtlety and interestingness in plays
 bahya dwandv bahari shaktiyon kii spardhaa or unke sangharsh se utpann hota he, jaise do virdohi raajnneetik dalon athwa senaaon kaa parsparik virodh
 In Shakespeare's major grief plays, the atmosphere of bloodshed and horrific scenes has created a very terror environment
 isi bhanti hatya or pratishodh sambandhi drishyon ke samavesh se bhi avsaad kaa put gaharaa ho gaya he
 Shakespeare took all these features and instruments from certain old plays and playwrights such as Seneca, Kid, Marlow, and used them in his plays, keeping in mind the occasional public interest
 du:khant naatakon kii jin visheshtaon kaa ullekh hamane yahan kiya he ve na keval hamelet, athelo, king lier, or makebeth main milti hai varan romeo and juliet tathaa england or rome ke itihaas par aadhrut du:khant naatakon main bhi aanshik rup main vidyaman hai
 Many of the historical plays that Shakespeare composed are Roman historians
 in roman naatakon ke lekhan main shakespeare ne itihaas ke tathyon ko thodaa bahut badal diya he or katipay sthalon par aisa prathit hone lagata he ki jivan kaa jo chitra upasthit kiya gaya he vah pracheen rome kaa nahin apitu alizveth kaaleen england kaa he
 Despite this, these plays have always been popular, especially Julius Caesar and Antoine & Cleopatra
 antony aid cleopatra kavitvapurn anshon sa bharaa padaa he tathaa cleopatra kii charitrakalpana atyant prabhavotpadak he
 The events of Greek history are represented in the Times of Athens and Perikiles
 angreji itihaas par aadhaarit naatakon main kuch to aise hai jo keval aanshik rup main shakespeare dwaara likhe gaye hai kintu henry chaturth ke donon bhaag or henry pancham purna roopen shakespeare dwaara pranit hai
 The poet has achieved great success in these three plays
 inamen shaury or sammanbhaavna kaa atyant aakarshak pratipaadan hua he or phalstaff kaa charitra atyant rochak evam spruhaniya hai
 Marlow has been successfully imitated in Richard III and Richard II
 shakespeare ke purv ke adhikansh angreji aitihaasik naatakon main tathyon or ghatnaon kaa nirjeev chithran rahata tha tathaa kori itivrittatmakataa ke kaaran ve neeras hote the
 Shakespeare has made these types of plays come alive by making them miraculous
 antim naatakon main shakespeare kaa paripakv jeevandarshan miltaa he
 Mahakavi had different experiences in his life, which is reflected in his creations
 pranay vishyak sukhaant naatakon main kalpanavilas he or kavi kaa man aishwarya or yauvan kii vilasita main rama he
 Grief plays express such sad experiences that make life toxic
 shakespeare ke krititv kii parinti aise naatakon kii rachana main hui jinamein unki samyak buddhi kaa pratifalan hua he
 The poet now sees with his prudent view that both happiness and sorrow remain embedded in life, so both are transient
 jivan main du:kha donon sannivisht rahete hai, at: donon hi kshanik hai
 Happiness comes after grief in life, so equality in thought and behavior is desirable
 in antim naatakon se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki hinsa or pratishodh kii apeksha dayaa or kshamaa adhik shlaghneey hai
 These plays have special significance due to their serious moral message
 shakespeare ke naatak svachhndathawadi hai tathaa pracheen unani or latin naatakon kii parampara se pruthak hai
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to find classical features of object in them
 keval apane antim naatak 'di tempast' main unhone teenon anvitiyon kaa nirvaah kiya he
 In almost all other plays, only the implementation has been taken care of, in terms of time and place, they are absolutely essays
 kathavstu main sadaiv paryaapt vistaar miltaa he or saamanyat: usamen kai kathaayen antarnihit rahati hai
 For example, we can take a Mid Summer Nights Dream, The Merchant on Venice, As You Like It or King Lear
 in sabhi main anek kathaon ke mishran dwaara vastunirmaan sampann hua he
 But this does not mean that the design of Shakespeare's plays is flawed
 ant:kathaon kaa natyavastu main sundar, kalapurna reeti se gunfan kiya gaya he tathaa sampurna kathanak se sankalit ekta kaa abhas miltaa he
 In spite of the lack of inventions in the classical sense, emotional and imaginative integration has taken place in these romantic plays
 patrakalpana main shakespeare ko or bhi adhik safalataa mili he
 In his plays he has created many fascinating characters who come before us in their lively form
 samay ke saath charitranirupan kii prakriya adhikadhik sookshm evam kalatmak hoti gai
 For example, we can take Rosalin, Porcia, Viartrus, Rosalind, Vayala Prabhriti Pragalbha, women included in the Sukhanta plays, who constantly introduce their sharp intellect and speech
 duusari koti kii ve naariyaan hai jinke anupam saundarya or sankatpurna anubhavon ke kaaran man main karunaa kaa udrek hota he
 The major among such females are Juliet, Ophilia, Desdimona, Cardilia, Imogen etc
 du:khant naatakon main charitrachitran kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 For example, we can take Hamlet
 naatak kii samast ghatnaayen nayak ke charitra par kendrit hai or usee ke vyaktitv ke prabhaav se katha kaa vikaas hota he
 Partially the same is true for other sad plays
 pracheen unani naatakon main anek smaraneey paatr milte hai kintu naitik or manovaigyanik upkarnon ke sahare ankit kiye hue shakespeare ke pramukh paatr kahin adhik rochak evam aakarshak hai
 The characterization of grief plays has become even more miraculous with the use of internal duality
 shakespeare ke naatakon ke kuch anya paatr bhi ullekhneey hai jaise vidooshak or khalanaayak
 Among the clowns, Falstaff Touchstone, Feste and King Lear's loyal clowns are important
 khalnaayakon main richard tritiy, iyago, edmund iatiyon aadi kii gananaa hoti he
 As Hazlitt wrote, the power of Shakespeare shows that not only is his character distinguished but his majority of minor characters also hold their own personal importance
 yadhyapi shakespeare ke naatakon main kahin kahin gadhy kaa prayog hua he, tab bhi ve mulat: kaavyatmak he
 Most of his part is stitched
 yahi nahin, praaia: sabhi natya rachanaayen kaavyatmak gunon se bhari padi hai
 Shakespeare has created an enchanting effect by the production of imagination, figurative expressions, musical rhythms and gentle emotions
 pracheen kaal se naatakon kaa kavita kaa ek bhed maatr maanate aae the or shakespeare ne pracheen dharna sweekaar kii
 Prose has been used occasionally for special purposes
 kintu saamaanya rup se ham shakespeare ke naatakon ko kavyanaty kii sangya de sakate hai
 Poetry was excessive initially, but shanai: shanai: his form became restrained and he began to control the idea of purpose
 isi bhanti shakespeare kii style main samavisht karne ke liye nirantar prayaas kiya; falat: praarambhik naatakon main vistrut varnanon ev sundar rupakon kaa bahulya he apni pratibha kii praudhavastha main jab shakespeare apane prasiddh du:khant naatakon kii rachana kar rahe the us samay tak unki style santulit ho gai thi
 In primary stage, expression was more important and ideas were less important
 kintu is madhyamik kaal main vichaaron, bhaavon tathaa abhivyakti ke sadhano kaa samyak samanvay hua he
 This balanced system focused on Shakespeare's ideas and moral paradigms in the last years and ignored stylistic miracles
 isiilie antim naatakon kii style kahin kahin angadh ho gai he
 Shakespeare wrote his plays primarily for theater, although we also enjoy reading from him because of his poetic qualities
 tatkaaleen rangamanch kii banaavat abhinay kii vyavastha, darshakon kii lokaruchi, in sabhi kaa prabhaav shakespeare ke natyanirmaan par padaa
 Two examples will suffice
 us samay range hue paradon kaa upyog nahin hota tha, isliye naatakon main anek varnanaatmak anshon kaa samavesh hua he
 Location, time and situation were indicated by these descriptions
 naatakon main swagat evam swabhaashit kaa nirantar upyog isiilie sambhav ho sakaa ki rangamanch kaa aglaa trikonakar bhaag prekshkon ke bich tak aage badha rahata tha
 Shakespeare did the surgeon for many male and female characters only because his suitable actors were available
 darshakon ke manoranjanarth anek drishyon kii avatarana hui he jiname rangamanch par uttejk evam manoranjak paristhitiyon kaa pradarshan hua he
 Like today's realistic theater, the Elizabethan era theater was bound by abundant means and fixed arrangements
 abhinay or pradarshan donon hi apekshaakrit unmukt the, isliye shakespeare ke naatakon main paryaapt rujuta milti he
 In almost all types of plays, Mahakavi has embodied lyrical freedoms that are unique for their beauty and melody
 inke atirikt shakespeare kii vistrut kavitaayen hai, jinamein 'vinas and adonis', 'di rape aav lukris' tathaa sanets kaa ullekh aavashyak he
 All these works belong to the last decade of the 16th century when Shakespeare's heart was charmed by the effects of beauty and love
 'vinas and adonis' main ek pracheen premakatha ko atyant kaavyatmak reeti se varnit kiya gaya he
 'the Rape of Lucreus' tells the story of the misfortune and death of a supremely beautiful Roman woman
 sanets main kuch aise hai jo kavi ke ek mitra se sambandh rakhte hai jisane vivaah na karne kaa nishchay kar liya tha
 Shakespeare, referring to his form and qualities, urges him to change his determination
 saneton kaa doosraa kram ek shyamvarn mahila se sambandhit he jise prati kavi ke man main teevr aakarshan utpann hua tha kintu jisane us sneh kaa aadar na karke kavi ke us mitra ko apana pranay diya, jisko dhyaan main rakhkar saneton kaa pratham kram likhaa gaya tha
 The question of whether Shakespeare has published his inner feelings in these sennets or whether they are merely traditional works is highly disputed
 sunda bhashaa java ke pashchimi ek tihaai bhaag ke logon kii bhashaa he
 It is spoken by about 27 million people, which is about 15% of the population of Indonesia

 ek chaityas ek buddha yaa jain mandir he jisame ek stupa samahit hota he
 In modern texts related to Indian architecture, the word chaityagriha is used for places of worship or prayer places where a stupa is present
 chaityas kii vaastukala or stambh or mehrab vaali roman dizin avadharana me samantaayein dikhti hai
 Chaitya, derived from Sanskrit 'chita'
 is shabd kaa sambandh mulat: chita yaa chita se sambandhit vastuon se he 
 The ancient tradition of building a memorial building or plantation on the pyre site or on the ashes of a dead person has been mentioned in Brahmin, Buddhist and Jain literature
 ramayana, mahabharat or bhagavadgita main is shabd kaa prayog paavan vedi, devsthan, prasaad, dharmik vriksh aadi ke liye hua he- devsthaneshu chaityeshu naganamalayeshu c, prasdgopursabhachaityadev grihaadishu,, kanchiaityashatarjusht: ; chaityaupankita bhoomiryasyeyan savanakra 
 Among the Buddhists and Jains, the tradition of building a sacred memory-building at the tomb of a bhikkhu or ascetic was followed
 falat: unke sahitya main is tarah ke prasangon kaa bahush: ullekh hua he
 Gradually, this word started being used for stupas
 buddha dharm ke prachaar or prasar ke saath chaityanirmaan kaa pravesh anya deshon main hua
 In Sri Lanka, the words 'dagba' and 'dungatein' were popularized in Tibet
 chaityas shabd kaa prayog kalantar main kisi paavan sthaan, mandir, asthipaatr athwa pavitra vriksh ke liye bhi hone laga
 Modern archaeologists commonly use the term to refer to a Buddhist or Jain temple, although in Buddhist architecture, a building built in a specific style is called Chaityaprasad in which stupas were installed for worship
 is tarah chaityaprasaadon ke nirmaan ke mul main bhi vahi dharmik bhaavana thi
 Ferguson is of the opinion that Buddhist Chaityaprasad of places like Bhaja, Nashik, Ellora, Karle etc
 are very close to the Girjaghars
 unki rachanastyli, vedi yaa garbhagrih, mandap aadi main kaaphi samanta he, yadhyapi chaityon kaa nirmaan girjagharon ke bahut pehle se hi aarambh ho gaya tha
 a special similarity is found in the sanctum sanctorum of the sanctum sanctorum, mandapa and pradakshinapatha and also in the Chaityaprasad and Hindu temples
 chaityaprasaad ke ardhavritakar bhaag main sthapit stupa upasna kaa centre hota tha
 From the side of the stupa, there was an effervescence, which was separated from it by columns
 prasaad kaa aadhaar vrittakar hota tha
 In its initial form, Chaityaprasad wood was made, which is mentioned in Ramayana and Buddhist and Jain literature equally
 kalantar main inhen sthaayee rup dene kii bhaavana se prerit nirmaataaon ne samooche chaityaprasaad kii sajiv kalpana thos chattaanon main aarambh kar di1 khadey parvat kii chattaane tarashkar unamem kala kaa ek nayaa sansar rachaa jane laga
 Large pavilions, pillars, stupas were built within them
 lekhon main inhen selghar, chetiyar, sellmandap aadi kaha gaya he
 Although initially the chaityagriha was wooded in this direction and the wooden bases and joints were also unnecessarily engraved into the stones, as is evident from the grand chaityaprasadas of Bhaja, Kondane and Carle, but later that unnecessary constructions Was abandoned

 bhartiya darshan ke chah prakaaron main se sankhya bhi ek he jo prachinkaal main atyant lokapriy tathaa prathit hua tha
 It is a philosophy with absolutely opposite beliefs from Advaita Vedanta
 isaki sthapana karne vaale mul vyakti kapil kahe jate hai
 The literal meaning of 'sankhya' is 'numerical' or analysis
 isaki sabase pramukh dharna sristi ke prakruti-purush se bani hone kii he, yahan prakruti jad he or purush chetan
 The principles of shiva-shakti of the Shaktas, the energy sources of the Yoga scriptures, are seen in parallel
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya
 mahabharatakaar ne yahan tak kaha he ki gyaanan c loke yadihasti kinchit sankhyagatan tachch mahanmahatman 
 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology
 shaanti parv ke kai sthalon par sankhya darshan ke vichaaron kaa bade kavyamay or rochak dhang se ullekh kiya gaya he
 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita
 isaki lokapriyata kaa kaaran ek yah avashya rahaa he ki is darshan ne jivan main dikhaai padane vaale vaishamy kaa samaadhaan trigunatmak prakruti kii sarvakaaran rup main pratishtha karke bade sundar dhang se kiya
 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the asymmetry of the world on the basis of the satta, rajas and tamas elements of different religions seems very wise
 kisi loukik samasya ko ishwar kaa niyam na maanakar in prakrutiyon ke talmail bigadane or jeevon ke purusharth na karne ko kaaran bataaya gaya he
 That is, the greatest greatness of Sankhya philosophy is that the origin of creation in it is not considered by God but it has been understood as a developmental process and it is believed that the creation after passing through many stages, in its present form Has been received
 kapilacharya ko kai anishvaravaadi maanate hai par bhagavadagita or satyarthprakash jaise granthon main is dharna kaa nishedh kiya gaya he
 The mainstay of Sankhya philosophy is hospitality
 is siddhanth ke anusaar, bina kaaran ke kaary kii utpatti nahin ho sakati
 As a result, this world has its origin from zero, not from any fundamental entity
 yah siddhanth baudhon ke shoonyavad ke vipareet he
 Work remains in the full cause of its origin
 kaary apane kaaran kaa saar he
 Work and reason are express and latent forms of virtually the same process
 satkaryawad ke do bhed hai- parinamwad tathaa vivartvaad
 Consequentialism implies that reason is transformed into action in real form
 jaise til tel main, doodh dahi main roopantarit hota he
 According to discourse, change is real rather than real
 jaise-rassi main sarp kaa abhas hona
 Sankhya philosophy was very popular and famous in ancient times
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya
 mahabharatakaar ne yahan tak kaha he ki gyaanan c loke yadihasti kinchit sankhyagatan tachch mahanmahatman 
 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology
 shanti parv ke kai sthalon par sankhya darshan ke vichaaron kaa bade kavyamay or rochak dhang se ullekh kiya gaya he
 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita
 vastut: sankhya darshan kisi samay atyant lokapriy ho gaya tha
 Whatever may be the reasons for its popularity, but one must have seemed that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by reposing the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale satvon, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat ke vaishamy kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada nyaayayukt tathaa buddhigamya prathit hota he
 The word "samkhya" is derived by adding the atomic suffix to the word "number" and the etymology of the word number is samachaksham dhatiya khyan darshanya suffix top, according to which it means Samyakti Khyati, Sadhu Darshan or True Knowledge
 sankhyacharyon kii yah samyak khyaati, unka yah satya gyaan vyaktavyakt rup dwividh achit tatv se purush rup chit tatv ko pruthak jaan lene main nihit he
 The man remains virtually untouched even if he appears to be stained in the prapancha from the top
 usamen aasakt yaa lipt dikhaai padane par bhi vastut: anasakt yaa nirlypt rahata he--sankhyacharyon kii yah sabase badi darshanik khoj unheen ke shabdon main satvapurushanyatakhyati, vivek khyaati, vyaktavyaktjvvigyaan, aadi naamon se vyavahrut hoti he
 With this wisdom, people believe in accomplishing the ultimate effort or goal of human life
 is prakaar "sankhya", shabd sankhyacharyon kii sabase badi darshanik khoj kaa vaastavik swaroop prakat karne vaala sankshipt naam he jiske sarvapratham vyaakhyaata hone ke kaaran unki vichaardhaara atyant pracheen kaal main "sankhya" naam se abhihit hui
 The term "samkhya" is also considered to be a fallacy from the word "number"
 mahabharat main sankhya ke vishay main aae hue ek shloke main ye donon hi prakaar ke bhav prakat kiye gaye hai
 It is as follows - Number Prakurvate Chave Prakriti Prakrakshate
 tattwani c chatuvinshad ten sankhya: prakirtita:
 The meaning of this is that the number which preaches the wisdom of nature and man, which imparts the effect of nature and the number which determines the number twenty-four of the elements, are called Sankhya
 kuch logon kii aisi dharna he ki gnanarthak "sankhya" shabd se kii jane vaali gaun sankhya main prakruti evam purush ke vivek gyaan se hi jivan ke param lakshya kaivalya yaa moksh kii siddhi maani gai he, at: us gyaan kii prapti hi mukhya he or is kaaran se usee par sankhya kaa sara bal he
 Sankhya assumes twenty-four elements, it is just a statement of a common fact, hence secondary
 udaiveer shastri ne apane "sankhya darshan kaa itihaas" naamak granth main sankhya shaastra ke kapil dwaara pranit hone main bhagwat 3-25-1 par shridhar swami kii vyakhya ko uddhrut karte hue is prakaar likhaa he- antim shloke kii vyakhya karte hue vyakhyaakaar ne spasht likhaa he- tatwanaa sankhyata ganak: sankhya-pravartak ityarth:
 This makes it certain that this Kapil is the innovator or prophet of Sankhya
 shridhar swami ke ganak: shabd par shastri ji ne neeche die gaye footnot main is prakaar likhaa he- madhya kaal ke kuch vyakhyakaaron ne "sankhya" pad main "sankhya" shabd ko gananaaparak samajhakar is prakaar ke vyaakhyaan kiye hai
 In fact, it means elemental knowledge
 parantu gaharaai se vichaar karne par yah baat utani saamaanya yaa gaun nahin he jitani apatat: prathit hoti he
 It seems that in very early times when the number of elements could not be fixed in the initial stage of philosophical development, then Sankhya first tried the subtle metaphysics of this visible physical world, which in turn resulted in the number of elements present in its origin
 : Was determined twenty four
 inamen bhi pratham tatv jise unhone "prakruti" yaa "pradhan" naam diya, shesh taees kaa mul siddh kiya gaya
 This same element "nature" was considered to be the result of the Chish Purush, resulting in twenty-three different elements respectively and generating the entire root world
 is prakaar tatv sankhya ke nirdhaaran ke peeche sankhyon kii bahut badi bauddhik sadhana chhipi hui prathit hoti he
 After all, how would it have been possible to determine the number of elements through micro-intelligence without thinking and analyzing for a long time? uparyukt vivechan se aisa nishchay hota he ki sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam donon hi prakaaron se uske buddhivaadee tarkpradhan hone kaa suchak he
 Even considering the basic nature of the figures and the Chit Purush both of the basic elements as proven by the Agama or Shruti proof, it is also evident to prove it mainly on the basis of conjecture proof
 aaj kal uplabdh sankhya pravachan sutara evam sankhyakarik, in donon hi moulik sankhya granthon ko dekhne se spasht gyaat hota he ki inamen sankhya ke donon hi moulik tatwon- prakruti evam purush kii satta hetuon ke aadhaar par anumaan dwaara hi siddh kii gai he
 Tips are also given in the man's plurality
 satkaryawad kii sthapana bhi tarkon ke hi aadhaar par kii gai he
 
 is prakaar sankhya shaastra kaa shravan, jo vivek gyaan kaa muladhar he, tark pradhan he
 Contemplation is the contemplation of facts and principles scripted by long-term arguments
 is prakaar jis sankhya yaa vivek gyaan ke kaaran sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam padaa, uskaa vishesh sambandh tark or buddhivaadita se he
 Due to this rationalism, some theories of Sankhya philosophy developed very independently from the Vedic sect in the later period, due to which the Acharyas like Badarayana Vyasa and Shankaracharya refuted it and even said it to the vedic sect
 yah sampradaay apane mul main to avaidic nahin prathit hota or apane parvarti rup main bhi sarvatha avaidic nahin he
 The famous commentator Vigyanbhukta has also considered Sankhya to be the contemplation of Agama or Shruti by the arguments of Satta
 unhone apane sankhya pravachan-sutara-bhashya kii avataranika main yahi baat is prakaar kahi he- jo "akodwitiya:" ityadi purush vishyak veda vachan jeev kaa sara abhiyaan dur karke use mukt karaane ke liye us purush ko sarv prakaar ke vaishamry- rupabhed se rahit bataate hai unheen veda vachanon ke arth ke manan ke liye apekshit sad yuktiyon kaa upadesh karne ke liye sankhyakarta narayanavatar bhagwaan kapil aavirbhoot hue the
 Science is clear from the monk's earlier discourses that he considers Sankhya Shastra as Vedanusari
 unka spasht mat he ki "akodwitiyah" ityadi veda vachanon ke arth kaa hi vah sad yuktiyon evam tarkon dwaara samarthan karata he, uskaa pratipaadan or vivechan karke use bodhgamy banaata he
 Vigyanbhuk has actually expressed his aforesaid opinion by following the earlier tradition prevalent in folk
 atyant pracheen kaal se hi mahabharat, gita, ramayana, smritiyon tathaa puraanon main sarvatra sankhya kaa na keval ucch gyaan ke rup main ullekh bhar hua he, apitu uske siddhanton kaa yatra-tatra vistrut vivaran bhi hua he
 In the Gita too, the trinitarian principle of Sankhya philosophy has been adopted very beautifully
 "trigunatmika prakruti nity parinamini he
 His three qualities always produce some or the other result, man is a non-believer "- this principle of Samkhya has become an essential part of Gita's Nishkam Karmayoga
 isi prakaar anyatra bhi sankhya darshan ke anek siddhant anya darshanon ke siddhanton ke poorak rup se pracheen sanskrit vadmay main drushtigochar hote hai
 From all these things, it seems that this philosophy has been Vedic in its origin, not impersonal, because if the truth were contrary to this, Vedaprana would not have given the above mentioned area for so much propagation of Samkhya in this country
 is anishvarwad, prakruti purush dwaitvaad, parinamwad aadi tathakthith veda viruddh siddhanton ke kaaran vedabaahya kahkar iskaa khandan karne vaale vedant bhashyakaar shankaracharya ko bhi brahmasutra 2
1
3 ke bhashya main likhnaa hi padaa ki "aadhyaatmavishyak anek smritiyon ke hone par bhi sankhya yoga smritiyon ke hi niraakaran main praytn kiya gaya
 Because both of them are famous as the means of ultimate effort in the world, are acclaimed by the saintly great men and consist of "linga", "tatkaranam Sankhya Yogabhishannam Gyatva Deva and Muchyatee Sarvapashai: Ya, etc
 " swayan bhashyakaar ke apane sakshya se bhi spasht he ki unke purvavarti sutarakaar ke samay main bhi anek shisht purush sankhya darshan ko vaidic darshan maanate the tathaa param purusharth kaa saadhan maanakar uskaa anusaran karte the
 Based on all these facts, it is expedient to consider Sankhya philosophy as Vedic
 haan, apane parvarti vikaas main yah avashya hi kuch moolbhoot siddhanton main veda viruddh ho gaya he jaise uttarvarti sankhya vaidic parampara ke viruddh nirishwar he, uski prakruti swatantra rup se swat: samast vishwa kii sristi karti he
 But the origin of this philosophy is found in the oldest Chandogya and Vrhadaranyaka Upanishads
 isi se isaki pracheenta suspasht he
 Only two fundamental texts of this philosophy are available today - the first "samkhya-discourse-sutra" with six chapters and the second "samkhikarika" with seventy kariks
 in do ke atirikt ek atyant laghukaay sutaragranth bhi he jo "tatv samaas" ke naam se prasiddh he
 The rest of the Samkhya Vadmaya is only the commentary and epitope of these three
 inamen sankhya sutron ke upadeshta parampara se kapil muni maane jate hai
 Scholars do not consider the Sankhya-discourse-sutras available for many reasons to be Kapilized
 itani baat avashya hi nishchit he ki in sutron ko kapilopdisht maanane par bhi iske anek sthalon ko swayan sutron ke hi ant:-sakshya ke bal par prakshipt maananaa padegaa
 The numerals are composed by Ishvakrishna, whose time is considered by the majority to be the middle of the third century AD
 vastut: inkaa samay isse paryaapt purv kaa prathit hota he
 There is no scripture of Kapuri's disciple, Asuri, but his famous disciple Acharya Panchshikh, in the form of many sutras quoted in ancient texts like Vyasarit Yogabhasya, etc
, it seems clear that any sutra script by him was famous in ancient times
 anek vidwaanon ke mat se yah prasiddh granth shashthitantr hi tha
 By the opinion of Udayveer Shastri, the conspiracy-related Sankhya-discourse-sutra available in the present times was also known as "shashtitantra" due to the representation of shasthi substances
 unke mat se sambhavat: kapil muni ke prashishy panchashikhacharya ne us par vyakhya likhi thi or vah bhi mulgranth ke hi naam par shashthitantr kahi jaati thi
 According to the opinion of some scholars, "shashthi Tantra" is written of the famous numerical annuity
 jaigishadhya, deval, asit ityadi anya anek pracheen sankhyacharyon ke vishay main aaj kuch vishesh gyaan nahin he
 Surface chemistry is the area related to phenomena occurring on the surface or interface
 antaraprishth yaa sataha ko sthool pravasthaon se alag darshane ke liye ek hifan yaa slash kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the interface between a solid and a gas is represented by solid-gas or solid / gas
 purna mishraneeyata ke kaaran gaison ke madhya koi antaraprishth nahin hota
 The macro phases we come into contact with in surface chemistry can be pure compounds or solutions
 antaraprishth kii motaai bahudhaa kuch anuon tak simit rahati he, parantu iskaa kshetrafal sthool pravasthaon ke kanon ke aakaar par nirbhar karata he
 Significant critical changes such as corrosion, electrode process, heterogeneous catalysis, dissolution and crystallization are reflected at the interface
 prishth rasayan kaa vishay udyog, vishleshan kaary evam dainik jivan ko paristhitiyon main kai anuprayog pataa he
 In order to execute page studies cautiously, the cleanliness of the page is essential
 ati ucch koti ke nirvaat main aajkal dhaatuon ke atyadhik svachh prishth praapt karnaa sambhav he
 Such clean surface solids should be stored in a vacuum only, otherwise their surface will be covered by the major components of air, ie, dinitrogen and dioxin molecules
 1
 adhishoshak : jis padaarth par kisi anya padaarth ke kan aakar judate he
 That substance is called absorbent substance
 aise anek udhaaharan he jo yah pradarshit karte hai ki kisi thos ke prishth kii pravriti, sampark main aane vali pravastha ke anuon ko aakarshith kar dhaarit karne kii haunti he
 These molecules only remain on the surface and do not go deep into the macro
 anuk spishij kaa kisi thos yaa daw ke sthool kii apeksha prishth yar sanchit hona adhishoshan kehalaata he
 The specific species or matter which is concentrated or accumulated on the surface is called the adsorption and the substance which has adsorption on the surface is called the adsorbent
 adhishoshan nishchit rup se prishthiya parighatna he
 Particularly finely powdered states, solids that have a higher surface area, such as charcoal, silica gel, alumina gel, clay, colloids, microdivided metals, etc
, act as good absorbers
 yadi churnitt charcol vaale band paatr main kai gaisen lee jaaen, to aisa dekha jaataa he ki paatr main gas kaa daab ghat jaataa he
 The gas molecules get concentrated on the surface of the charcoal, that is, the gases absorb on the surface
 ek carbonic ranjak jaise methilin blue ke vilyan main jab jautav charcol milakar vilyan ko acchhee prakaar hilaayaa jaataa he, to nisyad rangahin ho jaataa he kyoki ranjak ke anu charcol ko sataha par ekatrit ho jate hai arthath adhishoshit ho jate hai
 The aqueous solution of unrefined sugars becomes colorless when the organic charcoal is passed through layers; Because colored substances are absorbed by charcoal
 silica gel kii upasthiti main vaayu shushk ho jaati he, kyoki jal ke anu jail kii sataha par adhishoshit ho jate hai
 It is clear from the above examples that solid surfaces bind gas or liquid molecules due to adsorption
 kisi adhishoshit padaarth ko us prishth se hataanaa jis par vah adhishoshit he, vishoshan kehalaata he
 Adsorption originates from the fact that the dorsal particles of the adsorbent do not occur in an environment that contains particles inside the macro
 adhishoshak ke andar ke kanon par lagane vaale sabhi bal aapas main santulit hote hai parantu prishthiya kan sabhi dishaao main apni prakaar ke parmaanuon yaa anuon se ghire nahin hote, at: un par asantulit yaa adhishesh aakarshan bal hote hai
 These forces of the adsorbent are responsible for attracting the adsorbent particles
 ek die gaye taap evam daab par adhishoshan kii seemaa adhishoshak ke prati ikai dravyaman kaa kshetrafal badhane ke saath badhati he
 Another important factor that characterizes adsorption is adsorption heat
 adhishoshan hone par prishth ke avshisht balon main sadaiv kami aati he arthath prishth urja main kami aati he jo ki ooshmaa ke rup main prakat hoti he
 Hence adsorption is always an exothermic process
 duusare shabdon main, adhishoshan ke tapiya dharita main hameshaa rinatmak badlaav hota he
 When a gas is adsorbed, the circulation of its molecules is limited
 isse adhishoshan ke pashchaat gas kii entropi ghat jaati he
 That is, there is a negative change in entropy
 is prakaar adhishoshan hone par nikaay kii entropi evam tapiya dharita ghatati hai
 For a process to be spontaneous, the thermodynamic requirement is that a negative change must be made in the Gibbs energy field at constant temperature and pressure, ie a decrease in Gibbs energy
 thoson par gaison ke adhishoshan do prakaar ke hote hai
 If the accumulation of gases on the surface of a solid is due to weak wanderwallas forces, the adsorption is called physical adsorption
 jab gas ke anu yaa parmaanu thos prishth par rasinic bandhon se judate hai to adhishoshan, rasinic adhishoshan kehalaata hai
 Chemical bonds can be covalent or ionic in nature
 rasinic adhishoshan main ucch sakriyan urja sammilit hoti he, at: ise saamanyatya sakriyat adhishoshan sadambhit kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes these two processes occur together and it is not easy to determine the type of adsorption
 nimna taap par hone bala bhautik adhishoshan taap badhaane par rasrovasoshana main badal jaataa he
 For example, dihydrogen is first adsorbed by nickel surface settlements on the surface
 tatpashchaat hydrogen ke anu, parmaanuon main viyojit hote hai, jo ki rasovasoshana dwaara nickel ko sataha par bandhe rahete hai
 Lack of specificity - The two surfaces of a adsorbent do not indicate any preference for a specific gas because the wanderwallous forces are widespread
 adhikyonshya kii prakruti - kisi thos dwaara adhishoshit gas ko maatra gas kaa prakruti par nirbhar karti he
 In general, easily liquefied gases are easily absorbed, as the wanderwall forces are more powerful near critical temperatures
 isiilie ek gram sakriyat charcol, methen ko apeksha adhik sulfur dianvisaide ko adhishoshit karata he jo ki saadhe chaar emel- uihainhonjan se bhi adhik he
 Sublime nature - Adsorption of gases on solids is generally inert
 at: thos + gas = gas / thos + urja Increasing the pressure causes more gas to be absorbed as it reduces the volume of the gas and the pressure can be reduced by removing the gas
 adhishoshan prakram ooshmakshepi hone ke kaaran hai bhautik adhishoshan nimna taap par sahajata se hota he or taap badhane ram ghatata he Surface area of the adsorbent - The magnitude of adsorption increases as the surface area of the adsorbent increases
 at: maheen churnit dhaatuen evam sarandhra padaarth jinka prishthiya kshetrafal adhik hota he, achche adhishoshak hote hai
 Enthalpy of Adsorption - Of course, most of the physical is an exothermic process but the extrathalmy of adsorption is extremely low
 aisa isiilie hota he kyonki gasiy anuon evam thos sataha ke madhya aakarshan keval durbal vanderwalas balon ke kaaran hota he
 High Specification - Antibody is highly specialized and only if there is a possibility of chemical bond between the adsorbent and the subdivision
 udaahranarth, aanxigen dhaatuon par aanksaide banane ke kaaran adhishoshit hoti he evam hydrogen kaa sankraman dhaatuon dwaara avasorana dydride banane ke kaaran hota he
 Anuktamarnayata - Due to the formation of a compound in rashabhoshna, its nature is unproductive
 rasovasoshana bhi ek ooshmakshepi prakram hai parantu ucch sakriyan urja ke kaaran nimna tapon par yah bahut dhimaa hauta he
 Like most chemical changes, adsorption often increases with increasing temperature
 nimnataap par gas kaa bhautik adhishoshan, ucch taap par rasovasoshana main badal saktaa he
 Generally, high pressure is also helpful for cookware
 mushthiya kshetrafalad - bhautik adhishishan ke samaan rasovasoshana bhi adhishoshak kaa prishthiya kshetrafal badhane par badhata hai
 Adsorption enthalpy - The enthalpy of adsorption is high because a chemical bond is formed in it
 adhishoshan main padaarth keval prishth par sandrit hota he evam adhishoshak kii sataha se sthool main pravesh nahin karata, jabaki avasorana main padaarth, thos ke sampurna sthool main samaanroop se vitarit ho jaataa he
 For example, when a chalk is immersed in ink, the surface of the chalk retains the color of the ink due to adsorption of dye molecules
 keval syaahi kaa vilaayak avasorana ke karan chaak main andar tak chalaa jaataa he
 On breaking the chalk, it comes out white from inside
 jal vaashp kaa udhaaharan lekar adhishoshan ev avasorana main vibhed kiya ja saktaa he
 Water vapor is absorbed by dry calcium chloride while adsorbed by silica gel
 duusare shabdon main, adhishoshan main adhishoshya kii sandratha keval adhishoshak ke prishth par badhati he jabaki avasorana main sandratha thos ke sampurna sthool main ek samaan rahati he

 The date and origin of a disputed instrument as a musical instrument is believed to be 67,000 years old; The artefacts, which are generally considered to be early flutes, are around 37,000 years old
 haalanki, adhikansh itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki vaadya yantra ke avishkaar kaa ek vishisht samay nirdhaarit kar paanaa, paribhaasha ke vyaktiparak hone ke kaaran asambhav he
 The instruments developed independently in many populated areas of the world
 However, contact between civilizations resulted in the spread and conversion of most instruments far from their place of origin

 Researchers have estimated the age of this flute to be between 43,400 and 67,000, making it the most ancient and the only instrument associated with Neanderthal culture
 haalanki, kuch puratatvavidon ne is bansuri ke, vaadyayantra hone kii haisiyat par sawaal uthaaya he
 German archaeologists have discovered mammoth bone and swan bone flute between 30,000 and 37,000 years old in the Swabian alb

 Archaeological evidence of the instrument was found in the excavation of the royal cemetery in the town of Sumerai, Ur

 vidwaan, is baat par sahamat hai ki vibhinn samskritiyon main vaadyayantra ke sateek kalkram nirdhaaran karne kaa koi purna vishwasaneey tarika nahin he
 Comparing and organizing instruments on the basis of their complexity is misleading, as developments in instruments have sometimes reduced complexity
 udhaaharan ke liye, praarambhik slit drum ke nirmaan main vishaal pedo kii kataai or unhen khokhla karnaa shaamil tha; baad main slit drum kaa nirmaan bans ke tane ko kholkar kiya jane laga, jo kaaphi aasaan tha
 Similarly, it is misleading to organize the development of instruments on the basis of workmanship, since all cultures develop at different levels and have different materials available

 Some of these labels have significantly different connotations than those used in modern times; Early flutes and trumpets were labeled as such for their original function and use, and not for any resemblance to modern instruments
