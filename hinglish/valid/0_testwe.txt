 Kesamuti Sutta or Kalam Sutta is a part of the sermon of Lord Buddha located in the Angussaada body of Tippitaka
 buddha dharm ke therwaad or mahayan sampradaay ke log praayah iskaa ullekh buddha ke 'mukt chintan' ke samarthan ke ek pramaan ke rup main karte hai
 Names in other languages of Kesamuttisutt are as follows- vishwa sahitya main pali sahitya kaa vishesh sthaan he
 Almost all the languages of the world have been influenced and fostered by this language and its large literature
 katha, darshan tathaa bauddhik sahitya ke vikaas main to iskaa atyant mahatvapurn sthaan he
 This literature has been playing an important role in the development of moral and idealistic literature all over the world for centuries
 pali bhashaa main tatkaaleen itihaas, darshan, samskruti tathaa paramparaon kaa vistrut va pramanik varnan praapt hota hi he, kintu apni vaigyanik, pramaan-sammat, kalyankari tathaa maanviya shikshaaon ke liye yah sahitya vishwa main vishesh shraddha-sthaan he
 Pali literature is very large and extensive
 isamen praapt hone vaale buddha-vachanon ko mukhyatah teen bhaagon main sankalit kiya gaya, jo is prakaar vibhakt he- vinay pitak, sutt pitak or abhidhamm pitak
 In vinaya-pitaka, the rules of ethics of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis have been compiled
 sutt-pitak main bhagwaan buddha ke dwaara updisht shikshaayen pramukhtah sankalit kii gai hai
 Reviews of philosophical elements have been collected in the abhidhamma-pitaka
 chunki sutt-pitak main bhagwaan buddha tathaa unke pramukh shishyon ke upadesh upvarnit kiye gayi hai
 For this reason, this Pitaka is very important for the worshipers
 sutt-pitak main atyant saral va subodh style main sundar upamaaon tathaa rupakon ke madhyam se aadhyatmik tathaa bhautik jivan ko sukhpurvak jeene kii kala buddha-dharm parampara ke anusaar sikhaai gai he
 sutta-pitaka is available in five parts
 in paanchon bhaagon main angutar-nikaay apane vaishishty ke kaaran vishesh sthaan rakhata he
 The specialty of Angusak-navy is that in this order of numbers from 1 to 11, sermons of Lord Buddha have been collected on the basis of digits
 prayek ank kii sankhya ek adhyay yaa nipaat he, jo ankavaar vishyon kaa pratipaadan karata he
 Therefore, the chapter is known by the noun nipit
 yah jaananaa rochak hi hoga ki ek ank se ekak-nipaat main dhamm kii ek sankhya kii drushti se vyakhya kii gai
 That is, religion has been considered from one point of view in each unit
 duk-nipaat main us par do-do, tik-nipaat main teen-teen tathaa chatukk-nipaat main chaar-chaar drushtiyon se varnan praapt hota he
 In this way, religion has been explained in eleven-eleven types till ekadasak-nipat respectively
 ekak-nipaat se ankon main vruddhi hote hue duk-tik-chatukk-panchak-chakk-sattak-atthak-nav-dasak-ekadask is prakaar kram se ankottar vruddhi chalati he
 Therefore, this name 'angusadnikaya' seems to be completely meaningful and appropriate
 angutar shabd main ang kaa arth ank hi he
 When the answer of these digits is in the meaning, the word Angusva is proved
 kramshah ankon kaa gananaa kii disha main uttar hi yahan abhipret he
 In this way, the name Angusakya Nikaya is meaningful and appropriate
 angutar nikaay ke kesamutti sutt main jis prakaar se vaigyanik chetana tathaa bauddhikta ko jaagrit karne tathaa andhvishwaason tathaa ghisi-pity baton nakaarne kii baat kii gai he, vah apane aap main ek misaal he
 Two and a half thousand years ago, Lord Buddha was such a great scientist and lecturer, who embodied such modern, scientific and fresh thinking method
 dhai hajaar varshon purv buddha ne itani vaigyanik baaten kah di, jo aaj bhi vigyaan ko raah dikhaa sakati he
 It is certainly a criterion for the science of science
 angutar nikaay ke kesamutti sutt main kalaamon ko sambodhit karke bataaya gaya gyaan sampoorn sahitya-vaanmay main vishisht sthaan rakhata he
 In fact, due to the scientific approach of this Sutta, Buddhist literature and the tradition of Buddhist knowledge gained prestige
 pali bhashaa main kesamuti sutt adhik bada nahin he, kintu iskaa atyant mahatva he
 It has been described that Lord Buddha, along with his huge Bhikkhusangh, arrived in the corporation of Kalaam called Kes-mutt while doing charika in Kosala district
 kalam log bhagwaan buddha ke suyash ko purv main bhi ‘itipi so bhagava arhan sammasambuddho vijzacharansmpanno sugto lokvidu anuttaro purisdhammasarathi sattha devamanussanan buddho bhagavati’ is rup main acchhee tarah se jaanate the
 So they reached him to see Lord Buddha
 unke paas jaakar kalaamon ne apni jigyaasa jaahir karte hue poocha ki ‘he bhante! vufach shraman-brahman cese-mutt nigam aate hai
 Here, they praise their own views and condemn others 'opinions and degrade others' opinions
 punah duusare shraman-brahman yahan aakar apane mat kii prashansa karke dusron ke maton kii ninda karte hue nahin thakte
 '1 bhagavan buddha ke samaksh is prakaar apni baat ko upasthaapit karne ke pashchaat unhone bhagwaan se prashn kiya ki ‘he bhante! apane mat kii prashansa tathaa dusron ke mat kaa dooshan karne se hamaare man main unke prati shankaa paidaa hoti he ki in shraman-brahmanon main kisne satya kaha he tathaa kisne jhooth?’ Then, while quelling the doubts of the Kalamas, the great scientist and psychiatrist, Lord Buddha, presents the test of truth to them and says, 'O Kalamo! It is ok to doubt sandeh karnaa thik he
 Actually, doubt has arisen instead of doubt
 ’ Hey Kalamon! One should not consider a fact only because it has been practiced by tradition, or has been said since ancient times, or it has been said in the scriptures, or the eclipse of this fact is appropriate for the resolution of a suit
 aakaar yaa gurutv ke kaaran hi kisi tathy ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chahie, pratyut isliye grahan karnaa chahie ki ye dharm hai, anindaneey hai tathaa isko grahan karne par iskaa fal sukhad or hitprad hi hoga
 2 kesamutti sutt main kahin gai ye baaten kitni vaigyanik, vivekmay tathaa ashapurna he
 Due to the above subject, scientific thinking led to the beginning of great revolution
 buddha ke pashchaadvarti chintakon ne is vishay par bahut dhyaan diya
 This Sutta is the unique basis of the scientific thinking of Buddhism and Dhamma
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki kisi bhi baat ko, chaahe vah parampara se hi kyon na chali aa rahi hon, maatr parampara ke naam par use bina kisi vivek ke nahin maan lenaa chahie
 Over the centuries, a lot of futile rhetoric and evils have come up in the name of tradition, it is not intelligence to consider these evils without question
 isi prakaar yadi bahut pracheen kaal se bhi kisi vishay ko kaha jaataa rahaa ho yaa paramparaagat rup main vah baat chali aa rahi ho, tab bhi use bina sanshodhan jaisaa kaa taisa sweekaar kar lenaa uchit nahin
 Those subjects should be considered independently about the good and the bad
 adolf hitler ke vishay main prasiddh he ki vah apane anucharon se kaha karata tha ki ‘kisi bhi jhooth ko baar baar dauraane se vah bhi sach lagane lagata he
 Often this tradition also plays the same role
 kitni bhi buree parampara ho yaa kitna bhi neech chalan ho, kintu use maanate-maanate vah hi sahi lagane lagati he
 The same seems appropriate when repeated again and again
 atah bahut kaal se maani jane vaali tathaa suni-sunai baton par aankh mundakar vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie
 Even if something is written in a sacred book, it should not be accepted without discretion
 chaahe kisi bhi dharm-granth yaa pustak main koi vishay kyon na likhaa gaya ho, us par bhi vivekpurna chintan aavashyak hota he
 Many such unhelpful, inhuman and hateful subjects are also filled in many religious texts, books considered sacred and Puranas
 inamen vivarnit sabhi vishyon par vaigyanik drushtikon se paricharchaa tathaa vimarsh hona chahie tathaa vigyaanvaadee bahes bhi jaruri he
 One should not believe them only by having the words of a religious teacher or a person of attractive personality
 sadiyon se kai pakhand dharmaguruon ne buree paramparaon tathaa apana laabh hone vaale panth chalaaye hai
 To fulfill their selfishness, they run a variety of tricks
 punah kisi vaad ke niraakaran ke liye kisi tathy yaa pramaan kaa grahan samuchit ho saktaa he, kintu anya vishay main vah prativufal tathaa anupyukt bhi ho saktaa he
 This saying is famous that 'there are two aspects to the coin', if one side is bright or beneficial then the other side can be blunt and harmful
 isliye kisi vaad ke niraakaran ke liye prayukt tathy kaa sabhi paristhitiyon main sarvada grahan samuchit nahin
 Then due to country, state and circumstances, facts and truth also change
 drushtavy he ki ‘satya or vaastaviktaa main bhi anek baar bhed ho jaataa he
 'because of repeated or popular practice, we accept something as true, but in reality it is not the same
 atah vaastaviktaa ko drushtigat rakhkar hi koi nirnay lenaa samuchit he
 One should not accept any fact due to size or gravity
 anek baar dekha jaataa he ki keval bada hona hi paryaapt nahin, usamen gun bhi hone chahie
 Therefore, it is foolish to accept anything because of mere size gravity
 is prakaar kalaamon ko die gaye is upadesh main shiksha di gai he ki parampara se prachlit athwa pracheen kaal se nirantar kathith athwa dharmagranth main likhit athwa vaad ke niraakaran ke liye prayukt tathy athwa aakaar yaa gurutv ke kaaran hi kisi tathy yaa vishay ko nahin sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 Thus Lord Buddha declared these subjects as invalid according to the circumstances - tab koun si kasautiyaan hai ki jinhen sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he? yadi ye dharm hai, anindaneey hai tathaa isko grahan karne par iskaa fal sukhad or hitprad hi hoga
 Surely, what can be a better criterion for human thinking, scientific and rationalism than this principle? tab bhagwaan buddha ne kalaamon ko maanya baton ke vishay main bataaya
 He presented all the subjects in a very wise and systematic manner to the Kalamas, which can be said to be valid and true
 bhagavan buddha kehete hai ki kisi bhi vishay ko tabhi maanya kiya ja saktaa he, jab vah vishay dhrm-sammat he arthath dharm ke anukool tathaa kushal hai
 Surely, if a work or a topic in the society leads to the welfare of all and the people suffering from grief are relieved or the path of development and development in the lives of people opens up and everyone has an interest, then this topic should be said will
 atah sabhi kalyankari tathaa maanviya shubh karm vufashal dhrm kahe jate hai
 One should give recognition to these successful deeds and serve humanity by performing these successful deeds
 ve sabhi vishay jo anindaneey tathaa aghrunit he, ve samaaj main maanya qaraar diye jane chahie
 If there is no defect in any subject and that subject is worship, then in such a situation it must be recognized
 un sabhi vishyon or manyataon ko maanya qaraar dena chahie jinke grahan se sukhakaari or hitprad parinaam praapt honge
 If the result of doing any work is pleasing and the interest of all humanity is satisfied, then doing such deeds is definitely beneficial for the society
 aise kalyankari vishyon kaa karnaa laabhakaari hota he
 In this way Lord Buddha declared the above mentioned criteria as valid or true before the Kalams
 ve is prakaar hai - Thus, these scientific words of Lord Buddha are equally relevant and receptive in modern times
 aadhunik vigyaan ke liye bhagwaan buddha ke ye vigyaan-sammat kasautiyaan maarg-darshak siddh ho sakati he
 In modern India, the credit for re-establishing Pali and Buddhist literature mainly goes to Bhiksutraya i

 Rahul Sankrityayan, Jagdish Kashyap and Bhadant Anand Kaushaliyan
 aise samay main jabaki bharat se buddha dharm tathaa pali sahitya kaa lop ho chukaa tha, inhone hi granthon kaa sampaadan tathaa anuwaad karke prakaashan karaayaa tathaa prachaar kiya
 Careful reading of his life-stories, it is known that all three of them will be highly influenced by the kutmuti-sutta existing in the Dharmadhurandhar Angusvakya body
 kalaamon ko sambodhit karte hue unhen diya gaya yah kesamutti-sutt samast vaanmay prapanch main vivekwaad tathaa swatantra chintan ke liye ek prakaar kaa ghoshnaa-patr hi he
 This Sutta given to Kalams is indeed a realm for humanity
 is kesamutti sutt ne in vidwaan bhikshuon ko atyant prabhavit kiya
 In his autobiography, Rahul Sanvruthyayan reveals the attraction of Lord Buddha and Buddhist philosophy in this way - dhai hajaar varsh pehle ke samaaj or samay main buddha ke yuktipurna saral or chubhane vaale vaakyon kaa main tanmayata ke saath aswaad lene laga
 The socks and miracles that came to Tripitaka were not entertainment, but the content of my disgust for its improbability
 main samajhataa tha, pachchis sau varshon kaa prabhaav un granthon par na ho yah ho nahin saktaa
 How much Buddha has actually said in impossible things, it cannot be decided today, then the miraculous sentences of Buddha coming in between like coals hidden in ashes or stones covered with stones used to pull my mind towards myself
 jab maine kalaamon ko diye buddha ke upadesh- ‘kisi granth, parampara, bujurg kaa khyaal kar use mat maano, hameshaa khud nishchay karwef us par arudh ho’ ko suna, to hathaat dil ne kaha- yahan he ek aadmi jiskaa satya par atal vishwaas he, jo manushya kii swatantra buddhi ke mahatva ko samajhataa he
 When i read in the majjhim-nikya - 'like a fleet, i have preached to you religion, it is for crossing over, not carrying on your head and not carrying it, then you know, the thing that i have been searching for for so many days
 She was found
 rahulji bhagwaan buddha dwaara updisht maanav kalyaan sambaddh baton se tathaa tarksangat vishyon ke pratipaadan ke kaaran unase atyant prabhavit rahen
 In fact, none of the teachings by Lord Buddha is beyond human welfare and logic
 vefasamutti sutt main buddha bhagwaan dwaara kalaamon ko di gai shikshaprad-panktiyaan rahulji ke hriday main utar si gai thi
 Bhadant Anand Kaushaliyan also accepts his point of view towards this Sutta by accepting a similar thing in the preamble of the Anguskaya body
 ve likhte hai ki kesamutti-sutt ko padhakar hi ve buddha-dhamm tathaa sahitya kii ore aakarshith hue
 In the Preface to Anganwaja Nikaya, he writes as follows - vaishvik itihaas main bhagwaan buddha ne yah nai baat kahin he
 No religious leader dared so much
 sabhi apni apni bhagavatta ko sthapit karne yaa use bachaane ke prayaas main hi lage dikh padate hai
 But the talk of Lord Buddha is unique
 ve swayan ke dwaara kahi gai baat ko bhi aankh band karke na maanane kii shiksha ko is prakaar upasthaapit karte hai- Meaning - 'O Pandit! Just as a suvarna is cooked by high temperature, similarly my words should be tested and received, not due to my pride
 ’ Through the above verses, Lord Buddha keeps the faith of science out of reverence for himself and inspires him to take up the subject by keeping the test of science

 He launched a divine campaign of intellectual Digvijay to bring Buddhism out of India
 kumaril bhat ne jo aadhaar taiyaar kiya usee par aadi shankaracharya vishaal bhawan uthaaya
 Kumaril Bhatt was an Assamese Bhat and was first a Buddhist but later converted to Hinduism through conversion
 taranath unhen dakshin bharat kaa nivasee bataate hai
 Scholars differ about their period
 kintu saamaanya rup se unka samay isa kii saatvin shatabdi main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 He preceded Shankaracharya
 ve vachaspati mishra ke bhi purvavarti hai or mandan mishra unke anuyaayi hai
 Kumaril was the Guru of Bhavabhuti
 kumaril kaa yash harsh ke antim kaal main acchhee tarah fail chukaa tha
 Kumaril wrote three famous chronicles on Shabar Bhashya
 kumaril ke darshan kaa teen mukhya bhaagon main adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he- gyanamimasaa, tatvamimasaa or acharmimasaa
 The nature of knowledge and its means has been discussed in detail by Kumaril
 gyaan ke vishay main pehla prashn he ki yatharth gyaan athwa prama kaa swaroop kya he - yani jo dikhta, suungha jaataa, chakhaa jaataa vah kaise pataa chalata he man ko
 According to Mimamsa, knowledge of a previously unknown and true object is called Prama
 is gyaan kaa kisi anya gyaan dwaara baadh athwa niraakaran nahin hota or yah gyaan nirdosh kaarnon se utpann hota he
 The means by which prama or real knowledge is obtained is called evidence
 kumaril ke mat se pramaan chah prakaar ke hai - pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan, shabd, arthapatti or anuplabdhi
 The Advaita Vedanta also accepts the appropriate six proofs
 mimasaa gyaan ko swat:pramanya maanati he
 According to Kumaril, the authenticity or truth of knowledge comes with its origin
 jis samay kisi vastu kaa gyaan hota he usee samay uski satyata kaa bhi gyaan ho jaataa he
 No other evidence is required to prove its veracity
 kintu gyaan kii asatyata athwa apramanikta kaa bodh tab hota he jab uskaa baad main vastu ke vaastavik swaroop se virodh dikhaai padataa he yaa usko utpann karanevaale kaarnon ke dosha kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Therefore, epistemology considers self-authenticity about knowledge
 mimasaa ke anusaar gyaan kaa pramanya swat: or apramanya parat: hota he
 Both Kumaril and Prabhakar formulate this view
 ve bahya vastuon ke astitv ko sweekaar karte hai
 They do not consider the world false as Advaita Vedanta or Mahayana Buddhist philosophy
 sansar satya he
 The world and matter have independent existence from the mind
 unke mat se padaarth paanch prakaar ke hai : dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya tathaa abhaav
 They divide them into two parts: emotion and absence
 pratham chaar bhav padaarth kehalaate hai
 Like the Vaishyas, they have considered four types of absence: Pragbhava, Prabhavabshava, Exuberance and Interaction
 dravya vah he jisamen gun rahete hai
 According to Kumaril it is of eleven types: earth, water, air, sky, soul, mind, goods, pain, darkness and words
 inamen pratham nau dravya vaisheshik darshan se hi liye gaye hai
 Kumaril has given recognition to the darkness and the word as well
 gunon ke vishay main bhi kumaril par vaisheshik kaa paryaapt prabhaav prathit hota he
 Like Pustapada, they also have 24 qualities
 ye hai rup, ras, gandh, sparsh, sankhya, pariman, pruthaktv, sanyog, vibhaag, paratv, apratv, gurutv, dravatv, sneh, gyaan, ichha, dwesh, praytn, sukh, dukh, sanskaar, dhwani, prakatya or shakti
 In this list of virtues, he has placed sound and place of religion and unrighteousness in place of word of pragmatism
 karm ko bhi vaisheshik kii tarah ve paanch prakaar kaa maanate hai : unkshepan, apkshepan, akunchan, prasaaran or gaman
 According to Prabhakar, karma is a matter of conjecture, but Kumaril believes that it is evident
 saamaanya ko prabhakar tathaa kumaril donon satya maanate hai
 According to him, it is interviewed with the senses
 is vishay main inkaa baudhon se purna virodh he kyonki ve saamaanya kii satta sweekaar nahin karte
 Kumaril does not believe in the origin and destruction of the world
 sansar main vastuen utpann tathaa nasht hoti rahati he
 The process of birth and death of organisms goes on and on, but the whole world has neither its origin nor its destruction
 nyaay kii tarah kumaril ishwar ko jagat kaa kaaran nahin maanate
 Through numerous arguments, he has tried to prove that it is not rational to consider God as the cause of the world
 kumaril ke anusaar aatma ek nity dravya he
 It is different or wider
 vah karta tathaa karm-fal-bhokta donon hi he
 The soul is different from body, sense, mind and intellect
 vah vigyaanon kii santan maatr nahin he
 Kumaril has disproved Buddhist dogma and the theory of scientific science by many strong arguments
 unke anusaar nity aatma ke astvi kii anubhuti tathaa samaran aadi kriyaaon kii vyakhya nahin kii ja sakati
 The soul is consequential and continual
 aatma anshat: jad tathaa anshat: chetan he
 With Chidansh, the soul acquires knowledge of things: through achids, it is the possessive quality in the form of knowledge, pleasure, sorrow, desire, effort, etc
 which arises when a particular situation, such as a coincidence with the subject of the senses
 sushupti tathaa moksh kii avasthaa main aatma main chetana nahin rahati
 In Kumaril's view, the soul is both a knower and a subject of knowledge
 veda ke vaakya ki mai aatma athwa brahm hoon, aatma ko jaano is mat kii pushti karte hai
 The main purpose of Mimamsa philosophy is to represent religion
 jaimini ke anusaar dharm kaa lakshan he chetana arthath kriya kaa pravarttak vachan athwa veda kaa vidhivaakya
 According to the Mimansakas, the main meaning of Veda is the rendering of functional or rituals
 veda main pratipaadit karm teen prakaar ke hai : kamya, pratishiddh tathaa nity naimitthik
 According to Kumaril: *kamya karm - kisi kaamana kii siddhi ke liye kiye jate hai, jaise swarg kii ichha karne vaala vyakti yajna kare
 Prohibited deeds - which have been considered prohibited in the Vedas
 *nity karm - jinka pratidin karnaa aavashyak mana gaya he, jaise sandhyavandan aadi 
 Naimittik deeds are performed on special occasions, such as Shraddha
 manushya ko apane kiye achche bure karmo kaa fal avashya praapt hota he
 How do yajnadi deeds performed in the present result in future or in future? To explain this, Mimansak imagines Apoorva
 kumaril ke anusaar apurv ek adrishy shakti he jo kisi kaary ko karne se utpann hoti he
 It is due to Apoorva that the soul gets the fruits according to its deeds
 isse karm or fal ke bich apurv ek adrishy kadi he
 According to Kumaril, the study and contemplation of Vedanta helps in attaining salvation
 moksh kii avasthaa aatma kaa sharir, indriya, buddhi tathaa sansar kii in vastuon se sambandh sadaa ke liye samaapt ho jaataa he
 The soul is completely free from sorrow
 us avasthaa main sukh kii bhi koi anubhuti nahin rahati
 It is a state of complete freedom and peace
 moksh praapt karne ke liye manushya ko kamya or nishiddh karmon kaa tyaag karnaa chahie
 But it is necessary to keep on editing the routine karmitik karma
 vedavihit karmon kaa anushthan moksh kaa sadhak he

 Malaria is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases and is a serious public health problem
 yah rog plasmodium gana ke protozoa paraseete ke madhyam se failata he
 Only four types of Plasmodium parasites affect humans, the most dangerous of which are considered Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, as well as Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae
 is saare samooh ko 'malaria paraseete' kehete hai
 The female anophyllase mosquito is the carrier of the malaria parasite
 iske kaatane par malaria ke paraseete laal rakt koshikaon main pravesh kar ke bahugunit hote hai jisase raktaheenata ke lakshan ubharate hai 
 Apart from this, nonspecific symptoms such as fever, cold, nausea and cold are also seen

 The earliest description dates back to 2700 BC from China
 malaria shabd kii utpatti madhyakaalin italian bhashaa ke shabdon maala aria se hui he jinka arth he 'buree hawa'
 It was also called 'swamp fever' or 'egg' as it spread widely in marshy areas
 malaria par pehle pahal gambhir vaigyanik adhyayan 1880 me hua tha jab ek francisi sainya chikitsak charles lui alphons laveren ne algeria main kaam karte hue pehali baar laal rakt koshika ke andar paraseete ko dekha tha
 He then proposed that this protozoan parasite is the cause of malaria disease
 is tathaa anya khojon hetu use 1907 kaa chikitsa nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 This protozoa was named by Plasmodium Italian scientists Ettore Marchiafava and Angelo Sealy
 iske ek varsh baad cubai chikitsak carlos finle ne pit fever kaa ilaaj karte hue pehali baar yah daawa kiya ki machhar rog ko ek manushya se duusare manushya tak failaate hai
 But the work of certifying it as irrefutable was done by Sir Ronald Ross of Britain in 1898 while working in Secunderabad
 inhone machharon kii vishesh jatiyon se pakshiyon ko katwa kar un machharon kii laar grathiyon se paraseete alag kar ke dikhaaya jinhe unhone sankramit pakshiyon main paala tha
 For this work he received the Medical Nobel of 1902

 Although some patients died of malaria, it was considered better than definite death from syphilis
 yadhpi malaria paraseete ke jivan ke rakt charan or machhar charan kaa pataa bahut pehle lag gaya tha, kintu yah 1980 me ja kar pataa laga ki yah yakrut me chhipe rup se maujuud rah saktaa he
 This discovery solved the mystery as to why patients recovering from malaria suddenly suffer from the disease after years

 As an exception, all urban-rural areas in Africa suffer from this, although the risk is less in large cities
 1960 ke dashak ke baad se kabhi iske vishwa vitaran ko mapa nahin gaya he
 Recently, the Wellcome Trust of Britain has given financial support to the Malaria Atlas Project for this work, so that the current and future distribution of malaria can be studied better

 Malaria is spread by protozoa parasites of Plasmodium gana
 is gana ke chaar sadsy manushyon ko sankramit karte hai- plasmodium failciparum, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium ovel tathaa plasmodium malarie
 The most dangerous of these is believed to be P
 falciparum, which accounts for 80 percent of malaria cases and 90 percent of deaths
 yah paraseete pakshiyon, rengne vaale jeevon, bandaron, chimpaziyon tathaa chuhon ko bhi sankramit karata he
 Infections in humans are also known by many other types of plasmodium, but are negligible except for P

 When the disease reached the Hawaiian Islands with humans, many of the bird species there were destroyed by it because they had no natural resistance against it
 malaria paraseete kii praathmik poshak maadaa anopheleas machhar hoti he, joki malaria kaa sankraman failaane main bhi madad karti he
 Mosquitoes of Anopheles gans are spread all over the world

 Additionally, larvae have to repeatedly come to the surface of the water to breathe
 andey-larva-pupa or phir vayask hone main machhar lagbhag 10-14 din kaa samay lete hai
 Adult mosquitoes thrive on pollen and other sugary foods, but female mosquitoes need blood to lay eggs
 malaria paraseete kaa pehla shikaar tathaa vaahak maadaa anopheleas machhar banati he
 Young mosquitoes take the malaria parasite from its blood upon biting the infected human
 rakt main maujuud paraseete ke jananaanu machhar ke pet main nar or maadaa ke rup main viksit ho jate hai or phir milakar andanu bana lete hai jo machhar kii antadiyon kii diwaar main palane lagate hai
 When they mature, they burst and the spores that come out of it reach the salivary glands of that mosquito
 machhar phir jab swasth manushya ko katata he to twachaa main laar ke saath-saath bijaanu bhi bhej detaa he
 These spores in the human body then germinate to form germs, which then spread the infection further
 iske alaava malaria sankramit rakt ko chadhaane se bhi fail saktaa he, lekin aisa hona bahut asaadhaaran he
 The development of malaria parasites in humans takes place in two stages: first stage in liver and second stage in red blood cells
 jab ek sankramit machhar maanav ko katata he to bijaanu maanav rakt main pravesh kar yakrut main pahonchte hai or sharir main pravesh paane ke 30 minute ke bheetar yakrut kii koshikaon ko sankramit kar dete hai
 Then they start asexual reproduction in the liver
 yah charan 6 se 15 din chalata he
 Thousands of bacteria are formed from this germ which break into their guest cells and enter the blood and start infecting red blood cells
 isse rog kaa doosraa charan shuru hota he
 Some spores of P
 vivax and P
 ovale infect the liver and stop and become inactive as crypts
 ye 6 se 12 maas tak niskriy rah kar phir achaanak anshaanuon ke rup main prakat ho jate hai or rog paidaa kar dete hai
 These parasites keep re-multiplying themselves by entering the red blood cell
 ye valay rup main viksit hokar phir bhojau or phir bahunabhikeey shysont or phir anekon anshaanu bana dete hai
 From time to time, these bacteria break down nutrient cells and infect new red blood cells
 aise kai charan chalate hai
 Fever attacks in malaria cause thousands of bacteria to affect new red blood cells simultaneously
 malaria paraseete apane jivan kaa lagbhag sabhi samay yakrut kii koshikaon yaa laal rakt koshikaon main chupa rahakar bitaata he, isliye maanav sharir ke pratiraksha tantra se bachaa rah jaataa he
 P
 falciparum is another trick to avoid damage to the spleen - it causes a sticky protein to appear on the surface of the red blood cell causing the infected blood cells to stick to the small blood vessels and not reach the spleen
 
 is kaaran raktadhara main keval valay rup hi dikhte hai, anya sabhi vikaas ke charnon main yah choti rakt vahikaaon kii satahon main chipka rahata he
 Due to this stickiness, malaria causes bleeding problems
 yadhyapi sankramit laal rakt koshika kii sataha par pradarshit protein piefiempi1 sharir ke pratiraksha tantra kaa shikaar ban saktaa he, aisa hota nahin he kyonki is protein main vividhta bahut zyada hoti he
 Each parasite has 60 types of it, while all of them can display this protein in myriad forms
 ve baar baar is protein ko badal kar sharir ke pratiraksha tantra se ek kadam aage rahete hai
 Some bacteria turn into male-female genomes and when the mosquito bites, carries them with blood
 yahan ve phir se apana jivan chakra puraa karte hai
 In many malaria-prone areas, every patient with fever is given a presumptive diagnosis of malaria and treatment is started with quinine
 iske saath hi rakt kii patticas bhi bana lee jaati hai, lekin ilaaj shuru karne ke liye iske parinaamon kii pratiksha nahin kii jaati
 This is also done in many areas where facilities for general laboratory tests are not available
 lekin malawi main hua ek adhyayan bataata he ki bukhaar ke saath-saath yadi guda kaa taapmaana, nakhunon main raktaheenata or tilli ke aakaar ko bhi dhyaan main liya jaae to malaria ke anaavashyak upachaar se bahut bachaa ja saktaa he 
 )
 rakt patticoon kaa sookshmdarshi se pareekshan karnaa malaria ke nidaan kaa sabase sasta, acha tathaa bharosemand tarika mana jaataa he
 The specific symptoms of the four malaria parasites can be diagnosed separately by this test
 rakt patticas do tarah se banaai jaati hai - patali or moti
 Thin plaques can better protect the parasite's texture, on the other hand, thicker plaques can allow more blood to be checked in less time and a lower volume of infection can be diagnosed
 anbhavi pareekshak rakt main 0
 xxrep 6 0 1 pratishat tak ke sankraman ko pahchaan sakate hai
 For these reasons both thick and thin strips are made
 saath hi ek se adhik valay charnon kii jaanch karnaa jaruri hota he, kyonki chaaron parjiviyon ke valay charan bahudhaa ek jaise dikhte hai
 
 malaria ke nidaan ke liye anek antigen-aadhaarit dipstick pareekshan yaa malaria rapid antigen test bhi uplabdh hai
 They require only one drop of blood, and in just 15–20 minutes, the result is not required, laboratory is not required
 ye sookshmdarshi jaanch se thode kamatar maane jate he
 But in areas where microscopic examination facilities are not available or the examiners do not experience the diagnosis of malaria, antigen testing can be done with a drop of blood in the affected area
 sabase pehle in pareekshanon kaa vikaas pi
 failciparum ke kinvak glutamet deehydrogenez ko antigen ke rup main prayog karke kiya gaya
 But soon a test called optimal-it was developed using another enzyme lactate dehydrogenase
 ye kinvak rakt main adhik samay tak maujuud nahin rahete or paraseete kaa khaatmaa ho jane par ye bhi rakt se nikal jate hai, atah in pareekshanon kaa upyog ilaaj kii safalataa yaa vifaltaa jaanane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 optimal-it can also differentiate between falciparum and non-falciparum malaria
 yah pi
 failciparum kaa 0
01 pratishat or gaiyr-failciparum malaria parjiviyon kaa 0
1 pratishat tak rakt main nidaan kar saktaa he
 Additionally, P
 falciparum can diagnose up to 0
002 percent of malaria parasites in the parachoc-pf blood based on specific histidine-rich proteins, but does not distinguish between falciparum and non-falciparum malaria
 inke atirikt polimarez shrinkhalaa abhikriya kaa prayog karke or aanvik vidhiyon ke prayog se bhi kuch pareekshan viksit kiye gaye hai, lekin ye abhi kaaphi mahange hai, tathaa keval vishisht prayogshaalaon main hi uplabdh hai
 There is still a need to develop cheap, sensory and simple tests that can be used to diagnose malaria in the region
 gambhir malaria ko africa me praayah pahchaan lene main galati hoti he, jiske chalate anya pranaghatak bimariyon kaa ilaaj bhi nahin ho paata he
 The presence of parasites in the blood can be caused not only by severe malaria, but also by many other deadly diseases
 haal ke adhyayan bataate hai ki malaria-janit moorchha or gaiyr-malaria-janit moorchha main antar karne ke liye malarial retinopathy kisi bhi anya pareekshan se behatar he
 Some cases of malaria are emergencies and it is mandatory to keep the patient under observation until they are completely healthy, but in other types of malaria it is not necessary, treatment can be done in outpatients
 uchit ilaaj hone par marij bilkul thik ho jaataa he
 Some symptoms are treated with normal medicines, along with anti-malarial drugs
 ye dawaaen do prakaar kii hoti hai- pehali jo pratirohak hoti hai or rog hone se pehle liye jane par rog se suraksha karti hai tathaa duusari ve jinka rog se sankramit ho jane ke baad prayog kiya jaataa he
 Many drugs are used only for resistance or treatment only, while others can be used both ways
 kuch davaayen ek-duusare ke prabhaav ko badhaati hai or inkaa prayog saath main kiya jaataa he
 Resistant drugs are often used collectively
 kunain par aadhaarit anek aushadhiyon ko malaria kaa acha upachaar samajha jaataa he
 Additionally, drugs such as artemisinin, which are prepared from a plant called Artemisia annua, have been found effective in treating malaria
 kuch anya aushadhiyon kaa prayog bhi malaria ke viruddh safal hua he
 Experimentation on some drugs is in progress
 dawa ke chunaav main sabase pramukh kaarak hota he us kshetra main malaria paraseete kin dawaaon ke prati pratirodh viksit kar chukaa he
 Many medicines which were earlier considered successful against malaria are not considered successful nowadays because malaria parasites have gradually acquired immunity against them
 homeopathy main malaria kaa upachaar uplabdh he, haalanki anek chikitsakon kaa maananaa he ki malaria jaisi gambhir beemaari kaa ilaaj allopathic dawaaon se hi kiya janaa chaiye, kyonki ye vaigyanik shodh par aadhaarit hai
 Even the advice of the British Homeopathic Association is that homeopathy should not be depended on for the treatment of malaria
 ayurveda main malaria ko visham fever kaha jaataa he or iske upachaar ke liye anek aushadhiyaan uplabdh hai
 Although effective treatment of malaria is available today, in many underdeveloped regions of the world, it is either not available in malaria affected areas or is so expensive that the common patient is unable to use it
 malaria kii dawaaon kii badhati maang ko dekhakar anek prabhavit deshon me bade paimaane par nakli dawaaon kaa kaarobaar hota he, jo anek mrityuon kaa kaaran banataa he
 Nowadays companies are trying to tackle this problem by using new techniques
 malaria kaa prasar in karkon par nirbhar karata he- maanav jansankhya kaa ghanatv, machharon kii jansankhya kaa ghanatv, machharon se manushyon tak prasar or manushyon se machharon tak prasar
 If any one of these factors is reduced too much, then malaria can be eradicated from that area
 isiliye malaria prabhavit kshetron me rog kaa prasar rokane hetu dawaaon ke saath-saath machharon kaa unmoolan yaa unase kaatane se bachane ke upaay kiye jate hai
 Many researchers claim that the cost of prevention against malaria treatment will be less in the long run
 1956-1960 ke dashak me vishwa str par malaria unmoolan ke vyapak prayaas kiye gayi 
 But they could not succeed and malaria is still present in Africa at the same level
 machharon ke prajnan sthalon ko nasht karke malaria par bahut niyantran paaya ja saktaa he
 Mosquitoes breed in standing water, such standing water spaces should be covered, dried or drained or oil should be applied on the surface of the water, so that the mosquito larvae cannot breathe
 iske atirikt malaria-prabhavit kshetron main akasar gharon kii deevaaron par kitnashak dawaaon kaa chhidkaav kiya jaataa he
 Mosquitoes of many species digest the human's blood after sitting on the wall
 aise main agar deevaaron par kitnashkon kaa chhidkaav kar diya jaae to diwaar par baithte hi machhar mar jayega, kisi or manushya ko kaatane ke pehle hi
 The World Health Organization has recognized about 12 drugs for spraying in malaria-affected areas
 inamen dediti ke alaava paramathrin or deltamathrin jaisi davaayen shaamil hai, khaskar un kshetron me jahaan machhar dediti ke prati rodhak kshamta viksit kar chuke he
 Mosquito nets are successful in keeping mosquitoes away from people and prevent malaria infection to a great extent
 anopheles machhar chunki raat ko katata he isliye badi machharadaani ko charpai / bistar pe lataka dene tathaa iske dwaara bistar ko chaaron taraf se purnatah gher dene se suraksha puri ho jaati he
 Mosquito nets are not very effective measures in their own right, but if treated chemically, they become very useful
 malaria-prabhavit kshetron main malaria ke prati jaagrukta failaane se malaria main 20 pratishat tak kii kami dekhi gai he
 Also, diagnosis and treatment of malaria as soon as possible also reduces its prevalence
 anya prayaason main shaamil he- malaria sambandhi jaankaree ikatthi karke uskaa bade paimaane par vishleshan karnaa or malaria niyantran ke tareeke kitne prabhavi hai isaki jaanch karnaa
 One such analysis found that it is very important to treat people with symptomatic infections, because they contain a lot of malaria
 malaria ke viruddh tike viksit kiye ja rahe he yadhyapi abhi tak safalataa nahin mili he
 The first attempt was made in 1967 on rats that were vaccinated with living but radiation-treated spores
