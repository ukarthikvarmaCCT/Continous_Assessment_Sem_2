 Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643, old style and new style dates | OS]]: 25 December 1642] in Woolsthorpe Manor in woolsthorpe-by-kolsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire

 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her
 jaisaa ki 19 varsh tak kii aayu main unke dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon kii suchi main pradarshit hota he: "maine mata or pita smith ke ghar ko jalaane kii dhamkee di
" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers

 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role
 us samay college kii shikshaayen arastu par aadhaarit thim
 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa

 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations
 did
 unhone laghuganak ke dwaara haraatmak shredhi ke aanshik yoga kaa sanniktan kiya, or ve pehle vyakti the jinhone aatmavishvaas ke saath ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa vilom kiya
 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton resumed his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years

 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views

 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window

 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries

 lekin 


 unhone apane nijee vishwaas kii saarvajanik ghoshnaa kabhi nahin kii- jisase is roodhiwaadee ko behad kattarpanthi jo samajha gaya
 He hid his faith so well that even today scholars are unable to know his personal beliefs

 iske liye libanij Condemned him: "almighty God wants to end his watch from time to time: otherwise it will be stopped to move
 It seems that he did not have enough foresight to make it a perpetual motion
" " Newton's position was strictly defended through a famous correspondence by his follower Samuel Clarke

 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"
 purv-atmagyaan ke khilaaf kiye gaye hamale "jaadui soch," or isaiyat ke rahasyamayi tatv, ko brahmand ke bare main boyal kii yantric avadharana se neenv mili

 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day
 Gone

 Monbodo and Samuel Clarke opposed elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalized it to ensure his strong religious views about nature
 shahi taksaal ke prabandhak ke rup main, newton ne anumaan lagaaya ki dubaara dhalaai kiye jane vaale sikkon main 20% jaali the
 Fraud was a very high treason for which there was a death sentence

 newton ko shanti kaa nyaayadhish banaaya gaya or june 1698 or christmas 1699 ke bich unhone gavaah, mukhabiron or sandigdhon ke 200 parikshan karwaae
 Newton won his commitment and in February 1699 he had ten prisoners awaiting release
 raja ke vakil ke rup main newton kaa ek maamla wiliam chaloner ke khilaaf tha
 Chaloner's plan was to set up a fake conspiracy of Catholics and then turn them into hapless conspirators whom he held hostage
 chaloner ne apane aap ko paryaapt samrudh sajjan bana liya
 While applying in Parliament, the Chaloner also provided equipment for making fake coins in the mint
 He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the mint processes so that he could do something to improve it
 usne sansad main arji di ki sikkon kii dhalaai ke liye uski yojana ko sweekaar kar liya jaye taaki jaalsaji na kii ja sake, jabaki usee samay jaali sikke saamne aaye

 Newton tested it for the second time with conclusive evidence

 According to Newton's first law, an object which is in steady state will remain constant and an object which is in the same state of motion will move in the same direction with the same speed until an external force acts on it
 newton ke duusare niyam ke anusaar ek vastu par lagaaya gaya bal f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec{, samay ke saath iske samveg p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec{ main parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 In mathematical terms it can be expressed as follows chunki doosraa niyam ek sthir dravyaman kii vastu par lagu hota he,, pehla pad lupt ho jaataa he or twaran kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue pratisthaapan ke dwaara sameekaran ko sanketon ke rup main nimnanusaar likhaa ja saktaa he The first and second laws represent the breaking of Aristotle's physics, in which it was believed that a force was necessary to maintain motion
 ve rajya main vyavastha kii gati kaa ek uddeshy he rajya badalane ke liye hai ki ek hi shakti kii jarurat he
 The SI unit of force is named Newton in honor of Newton
 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward push of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun that the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii
 a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room in which Newton lived while studying

 dakshin america ke automobile bag naamak keet ke sir par safed or dum par laal prakaash paaya jaataa he
 Two types of photogenic fishes are found in the Banda Sea of the Dutch East Indies
 inke sharir main ek vishesh avyav hota he, jisamen prakashotpadak jeevanu rahete hai
 The composition of this ingredient is like a cup and the bacteria living in it belong to a particular caste
 inhen saadhaarant: prayogshaala main na to sanvardhit kiya ja saktaa he or na ye machhlee ke sharir ke baahar jivit hi rah sakate hai
 These are symbiotic glowing bacteria
 rakt kii naaliyon kii ek jatil sanhati yahan bhojan evam prakashotpaadan ke liye aavashyak oxigen pahunchaati he
 These bacteria continue to glow as long as they live
 duusari machhliyon ke prakashotpadak ang uttejit hone par chamakate hai
 Therefore they produce and extinguish the light as they wish
 sahjivi jeevanuon dwaara prakaash utpann karanevaale praaniyon kii prakashotpaadan kriya aichhik nahin hoti
 They have a covering over their photogenic organs
 is aavaran ke koshon main kaale rang ke kan hote hai, jo aavaran band hone par jeevanuon ko puri tarah dhank lete hai
 The light does not go out of it
 is aavaran kaa kholana yaa band karnaa aichhik hota he
 That's why these fish are called light eyelids
 in jantuon main prakashotpadak angon kaa kya upyog he, yah thik thik gyaat nahin
 It is estimated that these organs help them to see the objects around them
 si pen prakaash dwaara khaadya jeevon ko aakarshith karte hai
 There are also some creatures in which light is for the attraction of male and female
 jugnu iskaa udhaaharan he
 Regarding the light generated by organisms, earlier people believed that this light is probably due to phosphorus
 kintu yah thik nahin he, kyonki phosphorus vishaiylla hone ke kaaran jivit koshikaon main nahin rah saktaa
 Polyps are virtually the result of oxidation
 san 1794 main italian vaigyanik spalenzani ne siddh kiya ki jantuprakash ke liye jal kii upasthiti aavashyak he
 a light-producing organism gives light only in wet state, not in dry state
 sookhne ke baad yadi jeev ko geela kiya jaay to vah pun: prakaash dene lagata he
 Therefore, it is clear that light is a simple chemical activity, not a special action of living matter
 jantukosh prakashotpaadan ke liye jo vastu banaate hai, use photogen yaa luciferine kehete hai
 French scientist Dubva discovered in 1887 that chemical substances contained two substances, luciferin and luciferase
 luciferine oxikrut hokar prakaash utpann karata he or luciferes utprerak yaa prakinv kaa kaary karata he
 Luciferin does not get destroyed by heating, but luciferase is destroyed when heated
 kuch abhikarmakon kii sahaayta se in donon ko avakshipt karke tathaa upyukt vilaayakon main pun: villin kar inhen pruthak kiya ja saktaa he
 Although these grains have been separated, their exact chemical composition is not yet known
 inako protein kii jati main rakh sakate hai
 In 1918, EN Harvi proved by experiments that luciferin is formed again if the light of luciferin is lost after oxidation, and if it is added with a refractor
 prakaash utpann karanevaale jantuon main oxikaran or avkaran kii kriya kramash: hua karti he or jantuprakash utpann karte rahete hai

 Even though Kalki's historical romance stories have captured the hearts of thousands of readers by recreating the glorious Tamil life of the Pallava and Chola dynasties, critics have been divided on the basis of their literary merit
 ek ore, aalochakon ke abhipraay yah he ki kalki ke upanyaason roylty par bahut mahattav dekar, aam logon par jor nahin lagaaya
 And the sudden twists and turns in their stories make the stories unrealistic

 Kalki was a keen student of these aspects which he learned through engraved inscription and coin sources and enriched his novels with all these facts of history

 By the time Sivagamiyin Saddham was over after twelve years, that vision had left a deep and lasting impression in his heart

 In the preface of Sivagamian Saddham and the epilogue of Ponniyin Selvan, he states the percentage of fact and imagination
 itihaas main kalki ke hit, apane aitihaasik upanyaason kii suvidhaon or unke lokapriyata, dusron ko is vishaal or nae kshetra main pravesh karne or shreshth krity yogadan karne ke liye prerit kiya he

 During that time, the old satellites revolving around Varun had a lot of collisions due to the changing effect of gravity, which caused the satellite to collapse and leave its debris and Duspina is the result of that
 triton ko chhodkar, varun ke anya upgrahon kaa nirmaan kuch aise hi hua tha
 Like some of the other inner moons of Varuna, Duspina is slowly approaching the Varuna and scientists think that at some point it will either collapse and collapse in Varuna's atmosphere or Varun's inside boundary limits Breaking by its gravity would create debris for a satellite ring

 It had a favorable effect on Tolstoy in his youth

 He has clearly condemned it in his diary

 Due to the question of division of the state, he had to leave the university without graduating

 In 1862, Tolstoy was married to a high-ranking elite woman named Safia Berhus
 unke vaivaahik jivan kaa purvaash to bada sukhad rahaa par uttaransh katutapurna beetaa
 In Tolstoy's married life, the ideal of a housewife was completely similar to that of an Indian housewife: but the views of the then Russian elite society were quite different

 But in 1886, he again appeared as a high-profile well-known writer and in the same year published his great novel work "the Death of Ivan Ilyich"

 Towards the end of the 19th century, Tolstoy's service to the poor and helpless grew to such an extent that he donated all his income from his creations to Russia

 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy
 galswardi, tamas maan, juls romyna aadi mahaan lekhakon par tollstoy kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padaa he
 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and so he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa
 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss

 Reference error: Expiry tag not found for tag fiqh islamic dharamshastra ko kaha jaataa he
 Fiqh has its impact on every aspect of Islamic life for Muslims
 jabaki shariat us samucchy niti ko kehete hai
 Which is based on Islamic legal, traditions and Islamic personal and ethical practices
 fiqh islamic nyaayashastra ke liye shabdaawalee he, jo islamic nyayavidon ke faislon se bana he
 The basic component of Islamic studies, Fiqh elaborates on the method by which Islamic law has been drawn out of primary and secondary sources
 islamic nyaayashastra kaa itihaas "prathanusaar aath avadhiyon main vibhajit" kiya gaya he
 The sources of Fiqh in order of importance are: koran kai muddon par spasht nirdesh detaa he jaise ki anivaary dainik prarthana se pehle shuddhikaran anushthan kaise karen, lekin anya muddon par, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa hai ki akele koran hi chijen spasht karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hai
 For example, according to the Qur'an — during the month of Ramadan, one needs to engage in daily prayers and fasting but Muslims believe they need more instruction on how to perform these duties
 in muddon ke bare main spashtikaran paighmbar mohammad kii paramparaon main paaya ja saktaa he, isliye adhikansh maamalon main daleelein koran or sunnat kaa aadhaar hai
 Some subjects in the early period of Islam are without precedent
 In those cases, Muslim jurists try to come to conclusions in other ways
 sunni nyayavid samudaay kii aitihaasik sahmati kaa prayog karte hai; aadhunik yug main adhikansh nyayavid bhi saadrishy or nae vishyon ke nafaa or nuqasaan kii tulana kaa upyog karte hai
 With the help of these additional tools, a wide array of laws are formed according to Sharia and this is called Fiqh
 is prakaar, sharia ke saamne, fiqh ko pavitra nahin mana jaataa he, or 'vichaar-prakriya ke vidyalayon' ke tafasilaat par anya nishkarshon ko pavitraapurna rup main bina dekhe hi asmaan vichaar hai
 This division of interpretation into more elaborate issues has resulted in different schools of thought process
 This broad concept of Islamic jurisprudence is the source of many laws in various disciplines that direct Muslims in everyday life
 shariat kii niti ko neenv bana kar nyaayashastra ke adhyyan ko fiqh yaa fiqah kehete hai
 Due to different interpretations of Islamic scholars in the case of Fiqh, jurisprudence in Islam got divided in many parts and many different jurisprudence related doctrines were born
 inhen mazahab kehete hai
 The main denominations in Sunni Islam are: adhiktam musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki chaaron mazahab buniyadi taur par sahi hai or inamen jo matbhed hai vah nyaayashastra kii baarik vyakhyaaon ko lekar he

 punjabi kaa inamen se matlab ho saktaa: In culture: anya: Monotheism or monotheism is the principle that recognizes the idea of 'god is one' or 'god is one' as the foremost
 akeshwarwadi ek hi ishwar main vishwaas karata he or keval usee kii puja-upasna karata he
 At the same time, he does not believe in any other supernatural power or deity that can be equivalent to or replace that god
 isi drushti se bahudevvaad, ekadevvaad kaa vilom siddhanth kaha jaataa he
 Philosophical pantheism, philosophical infidelism and philosophical skepticism are counted among the philosophical philosophies opposed to monotheism
 sarveshwarawad, ishwar or jagat main abhinnata maanata he
 Its tenets are - 'all are gods' and 'god is all'
 akeshwarwad keval ek ishwar kii satta maanata he
 Sarveshvarism holds the authority of both God and the world
 yadhyapi jagat kii satta ke swaroop main vaimaty he tathaapi ishwar or jagat kii ekta avashya sweekaar karata he
 By doing the philosophical metaphysics of the sentence 'god is one', it can be said that universality is God
 yah nishkarsh sarveshwarawad ke nikat he
 That is why these sentences reveal the same fact in two ways
 inkaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karne se yah prakat hota he ki 'ishwar ek he' vaakya jahaan ishwar ke sarvathitv kii ore sanket karata he vahiin 'sab ishwar hai' vaakya ishwar ke sarvavyaapakatv kii ore
 Three types of monotheism, according to the three odd forms of God, are also mentioned when considering from the time of country influence- inamen se teesraa akeshwarwad sarvaadhik vyapak he or iskaa sarveshwarawad se bahut nikatataa he
 This theory not only emphasizes the absolute power of God, but also emphasizes the inability of the world; But from different philosophical points of view, he also presents both the power and the inability of the world as two types of truths
 jagat kii asatta par bhi samaan rup se jor dene ke kaaran kuch log hindu sarveshwarawad kaa akeshwarwad ke nikat dekhte hue uske liye 'ekasmijls' shabd kaa prayog adhik sangat maanate hai
 From this point of view the power of the world is only realization

 According to the period, they get many forms
 sarveshwarawad or bahudevvaad paraspar ghanishthabhaven sambhddha hai
 Some people place polytheism first in terms of evolution
 bhartiya dharm or chintan ke vikaas main praarambhik vaidic yug main bahudevvaad kii tathaa uttar vaidic yug main sabhi devataaon ke peeche ek param shakti kii kalpana milti he
 Secondly, although the general reader can call the Vedas polytheistic by looking at the plurality of the Vedic deities, the enlightened scholar would neither have a philosophy of polytheism nor monotheism
 vah to bhartiya dharmachintana kii ek aisi sthiti he jise un donon kaa utsa maan sakate hai
 In fact, this religious situation was not so developed that it could be oriented towards either of the two
 kintu jaise jaise dharmachintan kii gambhirtha kii pravriti badhati gai, vaise- vaise bhartiya chintna kii pravriti bhi akeshwarwad kii ore badhati gai
 The notion that ritualistic deeds automatically give their fruits also reduced the importance of the gods of polytheism
 upanishad kaal main brahmavidya kaa prachaar hone par ek ishwar athwa shakti kii vichaarna pradhan ho gai
 Despite the recognition of many deities in the Puranakas, the emphasis was on worshiping any one of them as the head
 veydant darshan kaa prabalya hone par bahudevvaadi manyataayen or bhi durbal ho gai evam ek hi ishwar athwa shakti kaa siddhanth pramukh ho gaya
 It is on these grounds that some people consider monotheism to be the fruit of serious thinking
 vastut: sampurna bhartiya dharmasadhana, chintna or sahitya ke upar vichaar karne par sarveshwarawad kii hi vyapaktaa sarvatra parilakshith hoti he
 Although this Indianism is far from the prevalent polytheism, Sarveshwarism like other countries is establishing its nexus with polytheism
 mahabharat ke narayaniopakhyaan main shwetadipiya nivaasiyon ko akeshwarwadi bhakthi se sampann kaha gaya he
 The Vishwakasena Samhita has severely criticized the Vedic people for not being a monotheist and believing in Vedic ritualistic laws
 isi prakaar bhartiya dharmachintana main akeshwarwad kaa ek or rup miltaa he
 At first the variation of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh was propounded, along with Vishnu and Brahma were sometimes considered as embodied in Shiva
 kalantar main ekta kii bhaavana bhi viksit ho gai
 Only Shiva was accused of the qualities of both the remaining deities
 vishnu ke sambandh main bhi isi prakaar kaa aarope miltaa he
 Vishnupuran considers all three as manifestations of a divine being
 yah paramatma kahin shiv rup main he or kahin vishnu rup main
 The second famous monotheism is Islamic
 keval paramatma kii satta ko sweekaar karte hue yah mat maanata he ki bahudevvaad bahut bada paap he
 God is one
 uske atirikt koi duusari satta nahin he
 He is omnipotent, incomparable, swapam, perfect
 vah is jagat kaa kaaran he or nirmaataa he
 He does not incarnate
 vah desh kaal se pare anadi or aseem he, tathaev nirgun or ekares he
 In addition to these ideas, it was also considered a universal authority in Sufism developed under Islam

 As a result, they considered the abode of God in everyone and their abode in God
