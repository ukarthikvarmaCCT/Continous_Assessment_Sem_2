jaivik astitv se saamaajik astitv main manushya kaa roopantaran bhi samajikaran ke madhyam se hi hota he
 It is through socialization that he assimilates culture
 samajikaran kii prakriya manushya kaa samskruti ke bhautik va a-bhautik roopon se parichay karaati he
 This process of learning is subject to the rules of society
 samajashaastra kii bhashaa main kahen to samaaj main apni paristhiti yaa darje ke bodh or uske anuroop bhoomika nibhaane kii vidhi ko ham samajikaran ke zariye hi aatmsaat karte hai
 Socialization makes a person socially active
 isi ke madhyam se samskruti ke anuroop aacharan karne kaa vivek viksit hota he
 For this, the cultural values practiced by the individual are the form of socialization
 par samajikaran ke vishleshan or adhyayan main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie ki seekhney kii prakriya main saamaajik mandandon va samskruti kii sabase zyaada ahmiyat hoti he
 What is learned by denying them, such as murder, theft, or other criminal acts, is not counted in socialization, but in counterattack behavior
 inhen seekhney vaala vyakti samaaj kii mukhyadhara ke vipareet mana jaataa he
 He is also not in a state to make positive contribution to the society
 in nakaaratmak kriyaaon or aacharnon ko praayah vifal samajikaran ke udhaaharan kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 In this way, socialization enables a person to participate in the activities of society by making him a functional member of society
 samajikaran kii ek sabase mahatvapurn visheshta yah he ki yah jivan-paryant chalane vaali prakriya he
 a person's circumstances and social roles change and he has to learn new patterns of behavior and behavior to behave accordingly
 udhaaharan ke liye bachapan main jahaan baccha samajikaran ke madhyam se mata-pita, sambandhiyon va buzurgon se vyavhaar karnaa sikhta he, vahiin yuvavastha main use naye sire se daftar main apane sahyogiyon, varishton, padosiyon aadi se vyavhaar ke taur-tareekon ko siikhnaa padataa he
 Even in old age, a person adopts related social behavior according to new role expectations
 is prakaar samajikaran vah prakriya he jo janm se lekar mrityu tak lagaataar chalati rahati he
 The social and cultural values learned in socialization are relative to time
 isliye samajikaran kii prakriya bhi desh-kaal saapeksh hoti he
 For example, in some tribal castes, the emphasis is on giving arms training to children and providing formal education to children in urban societies
 bharat jaise jati-bhed aadhaarit samaaj main jatigat peshon tathaa karmkand sthiti ke anusaar bhi samajikaran hota rahaa he
 Such as the practice of preparing children of lower caste for agriculture, handicrafts and manual labor, whereas Brahmin children were provided education
 vishwa ke alag-alag bhaagon kii samskritiyon main kaafii bhinnata he, isliye samajikaran sthaan saapeksh he
 It is relative to the time period that in Indian society in the past, it was the ideal behavior for women to veil, blush and speak softly
 jabaki aaj stri-purush barabari ke yug main striyon se is tarah ke saamaajik vyavhaar kii adhik apeksha nahin kii jaati
 Earlier children were taught step-touch education, whereas today they boy-boy
 yani mulyon va vikaas ke pattern main badlaav ne samajikaran kii vidhi ko bhi badal diya he
 Sociologists have divided the entire process of socialization into two parts: primary socialization and secondary socialization
 yah vibhaajan samaaj ke praathmik va dwitiyak sansthaaon ke vibhaajan par aadhaarit he
 Primary socialization occurs through family, neighborhood and kinship, friend groups and early schooling in which the child learns a lot about becoming a participating member of society
 parivaar ko saarvbhaum maan kar samajikaran main ise aadharbhoot sanstha ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Under this, qualities of cooperation, sympathy, support and exchange are developed
 bhai-bahanon kaa prem, bado ke pyaar tathaa niyantran kii vyakti ke samajikaran main khaas bhoomika hoti he
 Secondary socialization begins with adolescence in which the individual learns to behave according to the needs of a more formal environment
 is avasthaa main college-vishvavidhyalay, raajnneetik sansthaayen, bazaar va dukaan jaisi aarthik sansthaayen, saanskrithik sansthaayen, daftar va factry jaise vyavsaay-samooh aadi ko samaaj kaa prakaaryaatmak sadsy banane main madad karte hai
 Socialization also provides the right solution to the problem of social control
 saamaajik niyantran main mushkil tab aati he jab log saamaajik mandandon ke anusaar vyavhaar nahin karte
 By socialization, all members of society behave in the same social situation and balance, peace and harmony is maintained in the society
 samajikaran ke antargat vi-samajikaran jaise pratyay kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he
 This means that those who have learned to conduct anti-socialism under the influence of negative socialization should be discouraged to conduct this type of conduct
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi aapraadhik charitra ke vyakti ko dand dekar yaa samajha- bujhaakar aparaadhon se mukt kara diya jaae to vah uske liye ek prakaar se vi-samajikaran hoga
 De-socialization is also seen in such a way that one forgets the earlier teachings such as the behavior of the elderly, such as touching the feet, doing havan-puja and not eating meat
 ise siikhe hue vyavhaar kii vi-samajikaran kaha ja saktaa he
 Re-socialization is also a process in which changes in the lifestyle and thoughts of a person occur
 fuj kii seva main vyakti ko puri tarah se jivan kii nayi style kaa prashikshan milanaa, kisi apradhi ko sakaaratmak vichaaron kii ore aakrisht karnaa, vivahoparaant stri kaa bhinn jivan-style vaale ghar ke anusaar swayan ko dhaalnaa isi punrsamajikaran ke udhaaharan hai
 Various thinkers and sociologists have tried to explain socialization on the basis of principles, including G
H
 Mead, Charles Cooley, Emile Durkheim are the main ones
 mid ne mukhya rup se samanyikrut anya kii dharna ko aadhaar banaaya he
 In this, a child and adult internalize the thoughts and expectations of others with respect to themselves
 balyajivan main koi baccha dusron ke kaamon kii kalpana karke uske zariye swayan ko dekhtaa he
 In this way he determines his authority from a social point of view
 charles kule ne apane siddhant kii vyakhya darpan main aatmadarshan ke aadhaar par kii he
 According to Coole, the status of a child is determined by three stages
 pehla, vah jaananaa chahta he ki duusare mere bare main kya sochate hai
 Second, he tries to understand the thinking about himself in terms of the opinions of others
 teesraa, vah apane bare main sochate hue apane ko acha yaa bura, shreshth yaa hin samajhane lagata he
 The main proposition of Kule is that a person makes a perception of himself in a long process and this perception is formed with the help of others
 durkhime ne samajikaran ko saamaajik tathy or samuhik pratinidhaan ke madhyam se samajhane kii koshish kii he
 According to him, the social facts, values, norms, collective beliefs etc
 of society are above the individual
 vyakti ko janm se inaki viraasat milti he
 Their creation is the individual's alone ikai ke haathon na hokar samooh dwaara banaaye hoti he
 They are outside the person and also impose compulsion on him
 is prakaar vyakti samajikaran ke rup main in samuhik pratinidhaanon ko aatmsaat karte hue samaaj kii sakriy tathaa upyogi ikai banataa he jisase samaaj main ekta bhi bani rahati he

 anya vyaktiyon ke liye harbart spencer dekhen
 Herbert Spencer was an English philosopher, zoologist, sociologist and famous traditional liberal political theorist of the Victorian period
 spencer ne bhautik vishwa, jaivik sajivon, maanav man, tathaa maanviya samskruti va samaajon kii kramik vikaas ke rup main utpatti kii ek sarv-samaveshak avadharana viksit kii
 ek bahushrut vyakti ke rup main, unhone vishyon kii ek vyapak shrenee main apana yogadan diya, jinamein nitishasre, dharm, manviki, arthshaasre, rajnatik siddhant, darshanashasre, jeev-vigyaan, samajashasre va manovigyaan shaamil hai
 During his lifetime he gained immense dominance, especially among the English-speaking academic community
 In 1902, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature
 In fact, in the United Kingdom and the United States "there was a time when Spencer's disciples could not even compare him to Aristotle!" ve "sarvshereshth kii uttarjivita " kii avadharana prastut karne ke liye sabase zyada jane jate hai, jo ki unhone charles darwin kii on da origin of spisis padhane ke baad principles of biology main prastut kii thi
 This terminology strongly suggests natural selection, but even when Spencer expanded origins into the fields of sociology and ethics, he also used Lemarkism
 wiliam jorge spencer ke putr harbart spencer kaa janm 27 april 1820 ko darbi, england main hua tha
 Spencer's father was a religious dissenter, whose leanings varied from Methodism to Quakerism, and it appeared that he transmitted all forms of power to his son
 ve johaan henrich pastalozi kii vikasparak shiksha vidhiyon ke anusaar sthapit ek vidhyalay chalaaya karte the or darbi philasofical socity ke sachiv ke rup main bhi kaary kiya karte the, jo ki san 1790 ke dashak main arasmus darwin, charles ke dada, dwaara sthapit ek vaigyanik sanstha thi
 Spencer received experimental science education from his father, while members of the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-darwinian concepts of biological-origin, notably Erasmus Darwin and jean-baptiste Lamarck
 His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer, pastor of the Hinton Charterhouse near Bath, completed his limited formal education by teaching Spencer some mathematics and physics, and a little Latin, which enabled him to translate simple texts
 Granted Thomas Spencer also left an impression on his nephew of his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political outlook
 Otherwise, Spencer was an educator who gained most of his knowledge from micro-focused studies and conversations with his friends and colleagues
 ek kishor or yuva purush donon ke rup main, spencer ne kisi bhi bauddhik yaa vyavsaayik kshetra main sthir hone main kathinaayee mahasoos kii
 san 1830 ke dashak ke dauraan rail parivahan ke kshetra main aae oochaal ke dauraan unhone ek civil ejeeniyar ke rup main kaary kiya or saath hi apana adhikansh samay prantiya patrikaon ke likhane main bhi lagaaya, jo ki apane dharm main gaiyr-anusaarak va apni raajnneeti main prajatantravaadi thim
 From 1848 to 1853, he served as assistant-editor of the free-trade magazine The Economist, during which he published his first book, Social Statistics, which predicted that humanity would eventually find the necessities of social life According to it will be completely adopted and consequently the concept of the state will be destroyed
 iske prakaashak, jon chapman, ne unhen apni sangoshtee se milwaaya, jisamen jon stuart mil, heriet martineau, jorge henry levis or mairi en ivance, jinke saath unka sankshipt romani judaav rahaa, sahit rajdhani ke anek pramukh prajatantravaadi va pragatisheel vichaarak shaamil hua karte the
 Spencer himself introduced biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who later became known as 'darwin's Bulldog' and remained his friend for a lifetime
 However, his friendship with Evans and Lewis led him to John Stuart Mill's a System of Logic and Auguste Comte's positivism and this led him on the path of his career
 He completely disagreed with Comte
 ivance or levis se unki mitra kaa pehla pratifal spencer kii agali pustak, san 1855 main prakashit principles of psychology, thi, jisamen manovigyaan ke liye ek shaareerik aadhaar kii khoj kii gai thi
 This book was based on these basic beliefs that the human mind works according to natural laws and that these could be discovered within the framework of general biology
 isane na keval vyakti ke sandarbh main, balki prajatiyon va nasl ke sandarbh main bhi, ek vikasparak drushtikon ko apnaane kii anumati di
 is pratimaan ke madhyam se, spencer kaa lakshya mil ke logic ke saahcharywaadee manovigyaan, yah dharna ki maanav-man vichaaron ke saahchary ke niyamon dwaara ek saath rakhi gai anvik samvednaaon se nirmit tha, tathaa adhik 'vaigyanik' prathit hone vaale kapaal-vigyaan ke siddhant, jisamen vishisht maansik kaaryon kaa mul mastishk ke vibhinn bhaagon main dhundha jaataa tha, ke bich saamanjasy sthapit karan tha
 Spencer argued that both of these theories were partial descriptions of truth: repetitive associations of ideas involved the creation of specific fibers in brain tissue, and that they be passed from one generation to the other through the Lamarckian methodology of experiment-succession
 could
 unka vinamratapurvak maananaa tha ki psychology maanav-man ke liye vahi kaary karegi, jo izac newton ne padaarth ke liye kiya tha
 However, the book was not initially successful, and the final 251 copies of its first edition were not sold until June 1861
 manovigyaan main spencer kii ruchi prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ko sthapit karne kii ek adhik buniyadi chintaa se vyutpann thi
 Like others of his generation, including members of Chapman's seminar, he was obsessed with the idea of demonstrating that everything in the universe — including human culture, language, and impermanence — was interpreted by the laws of universal validity
 Could be done
 yah us samay ke anek dharamshasreiyon ke drushtikon ke vipareet tha, jinhone is baat par jor diya ki rachana ke kuch bhaag, vishishtatah maanav aatma, vaigyanik anusandhan ke kshetra se baahar the
 Comte's System de Philosophy was written with the goal of demonstrating the universality of positive natural law, and Spencer had to follow Comte to accomplish his goal
 haalanki, spencer comte ke is vishwaas se sahamat nahin the ki saarvbhaumik anuprayog kaa ek niyam dhund paanaa sambhav tha, jise unhone pragatisheel vikaas main dhundha or utpatti kaa siddhant kaha
 In 1858, Spencer created an outline, which later became the system of artificial philosophy
 This huge work, with only a small number of compositions in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the theory of origins applied to biology, psychology, sociology, and impermanence
 spencer kaa vichaar tha ki das khandon kii is rachana ko purna hone main bees varsh lagenge; ant main unhen isse duguna samay laga or isane unke lambey jivan kii lagbhag puri avadhi le lee
 Despite Spencer's early struggle to establish himself as a writer, by the 1870s he had become one of the most famous philosophers of his time
 unke jivan-kaal ke dauraan unki rachanaaon ko vyapak taur par padhaa gaya or san 1869 tak ve apana jivan-yaapan puri tarah pustakon se hone vaale laabh or victorian patrikaon main unke niyamit yogadan, jinhen esez ke teen khandon ke rup main sangrahit kiya gaya, se hone vaali aay ke dwaara kar paane main sakasham ho chuke the
 His works were translated into German, Italian, Spanish, French, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, and many other languages, and he was awarded honors and awards throughout Europe and North America

 Members included physicist-philosopher John Tyndall and Darwin's cousin, banker and biologist Sir John Lubbock
 iske alaava kuch ullekhneey anuchar bhi the, jaise westominster ke dean, udaaravaadi padri arthur stanley; or charles darwin va harman won helmholtz jaise mehmaanon ko samay-samay par aamantrit kiya jaataa tha
 Through such contacts, Spencer had a strong presence in the heart of the scientific community and was able to create an effective audience for his approach
 In spite of his increasing wealth and fame, he never owned his own house
 spencer ke jivan ke antim dashak badhate mohabhang or akelepan se bhare hue the
 He never married and after 1855, he became an incessant diseased and constantly complained of pain and diseases, which was not diagnosed by any doctor

 In his last years, his political views became conservative
 haalanki soshal statics ek aise multah prajatantravaadi kii rachana thi, jo mahilaon ko matdaan kaa adhikaar diye jane main tathaa samantshahi kii shakti ko todane ke liye bhoomi ke rashtriyakaran main vishwaas rakhata tha, lekin san 1880 ke dashak tak aate-aate ve mahila matadhikaar ke kattar virdohi ban chuke the or unhone liberty and property difens lig ke bhu-swaamiyon ke saath milakar ek saajha kaarykram main uske khilaaf yogadan kiya, jise ve wiliam ewart gladstone ke netritv main tatwon kaa 'samaajwaad' kii ore jhukaav maanate the-mukhyatah swayan gladstone kii raay ke khilaaf
 spencer ke is kaal ke rajnatik vichaar da main varses da state main vyakt kiye gaye the, jo ki unki sarvshereshth rachana ban chuki he
 An exception to Spencer's growing conservative tendency was that for a lifetime he remained a staunch opponent of militarism and imperialism
 His criticism of the Boer War was particularly damaging and contributed to his diminishing popularity in Britain
 spencer ne aadhunik paper clip ke ek purvavarti kaa avishkaar bhi kiya, haalanki yah aadhunik cotter pin kii tarah adhik dikhaai detaa tha
 This "binding pin" was distributed by Ackerman & Company
 After Appendix i of his autobiography) Spencer displays a picture of this pin as well as a published description of its experiments
 san 1902 main, apni mrityu se kuch samay purv, spencer ko sahitya ke nobel puraskaar ke liye namit kiya gaya
 unhone aaajeevan lekhan-kaary jari rakhaa, apane jivan ke antim varshon main aksar shrutlekh ke dwaara, jab tak ki 83 varsh kii aayu main ve aswasthta se parrast nahin ho gaye
 His dead body is buried in Highgate Cemetery, London, facing the grave of Karl Marx

 The basis for Spencer's attraction to many people of his generation was that he seemed to present a pre-constructed system of belief that could replace traditional religious beliefs at a time when Orthodox opinion In front of the advancement of modern science, they were broken apart
 spencer kii darshanik pranali yah darshaati hui prathit hoti thi ki unnat vaigyanik avadharanaon, jaise ushmagatiki ke pratham niyam or jaivik utpatti, ke aadhaar par maanavtaa kii antim purnataa par vishwaas kar paanaa sambhav tha
 In short, Spencer's philosophical approach consisted of a combination of deism and positivism
 ek ore, unhone apane pita tathaa darbi philasofical socity ke anya sadasyon se va jorge combay kii atyadhik lokapriy da constitution of main jaisi pustakon se atharahavin sadi ke devvaad kaa kuch ansh grahan kiya tha
 In this, the universe was considered a cosmic harmony and the laws of nature were 'mercifully kind'
 is prakaar prakritik niyam susanchalit brahmad kii pratimaayein thim, jinhen srishtikarta dwaara maanviya prasannataa ko prachaarit karne ke uddeshy se nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Although Spencer renounced his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' concept of divinity, he nevertheless firmly held the concept at an almost subconscious level
 haalanki ve pratyakshvaad ko jitna shrey dete, ve usase bahut adhik grahan kar chuke the, vishesh rup se vaigyanik gyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon ke ekikaran ke rup main ek darshanik pranali ke iske nirmaan main

 This tension between positivism and the rest of their Devism remained throughout the system of artificial philosophy
 vaigyanik satya ke ekikaran ke lakshya main spencer ne comte kaa anusaran kiya; isi arth main unka darshanashasre 'kritrim' hone par kendrit tha
 Like Comte, he was also committed to the universality of natural law, according to which the laws of nature apply as much to the biological field, without exception, as much as to the inert field and to the human mind
 As much as the rest of the universe
 Thus, the first purpose of artificial philosophy was to demonstrate that as natural laws, there is no exception to be able to discover scientific exploration of all the facts of the universe
 jeev-vigyaan, manovigyaan or samajashasre par spencer dwaara likhe gaye sabhi granthon kaa uddeshy in vishisht kshetron main prakritik niyamon ke astitv ko pradarshit karnaa hi tha
 Even in his writings on morality, he held the view that it was possible to find the 'rules' of impermanence, which, despite having normative content, whose state was only the laws of nature, is a concept whose origin Can be seen in Coombe's Constitution of Man
 kritrim darshanashasre kaa doosraa uddeshy yah darshana tha ki yahi niyam anwarat rup se vikaas kii ore le jate hai
 Unlike Comte, who emphasized only the unity of scientific method, Spencer attempted to unify scientific knowledge by decomposing all natural laws into one basic law, the law of origin
 is sandarbh main, unhone edinburgh ke prakaashak robert chembers dwaara unki anaam rachana vestiges of natural history of kriyeshan main prastaavit kiye gaye pratimaan kaa paalan kiya
 Although often dismissed as an ineffective precursor of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Chambers' book was actually a program for the integration of science, with the aim of demonstrating that Laplace's origins in the Solar System Both the nebula concept and Lemark's theory of species conversion exemplify 'an amazing generalization of progressive development' It was a battle
 chembers chapman kii sangoshtee se jude hue the or unka kaary kritrim darshanashasre ke liye ek anbhigyaat sancha bana
 The clearest expression of Spencer's evolutionary approach was first articulated in his essay, 'progress: Its Law and Cause', which was published in 1857 in Chapman's Westminster Review and later the basis of the First Principles of a New System of Philosophy
 Made up
 In it, he explained the theory of evolution, combining information from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's essay 'the Theory of Life' —which itself was derived from Friedrich von Schelling's Naturephilosophy — and generalizing von Baer's law of embryonic development i went
 spencer ne yah vichaar vyakt kiya ki brahmad kii sabhi sanrachanaayen ek saral, samaan, samarupata se ek jatil, bhinn, vividhta main viksit hote hai or vibhinn bhaagon ke bade ekikaran kii prakriya bhi iske saath hi chalati rahati he
 Spencer believed that this evolutionary process could be seen working across the universe
 yah ek saarvbhaumik niyam tha, jo ki taron or akashgangaon par bhi utana hi lagu hota tha, jitna ki jaivik praaniyon par or maanviya saamaajik vyavastha par bhi utana hi lagu hota tha, jitna kii maanav-man par
 yah keval apni vyapak saamanyata ke dwaara hi vaigyanik niyamon se bhinn tha or is siddhant ke udhaaharan ke rup main vishesh vigyaan ke niyam pradarshit kiye ja sakate the
 This attempt to explain the development of complexity was completely different from the one found in Darwin's Origin of Species published two years later
 aksar kaaphi, galat tareeke se, yah mana jaataa he ki spencer ne prakritik chayan par darwin dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko keval hathiyaa liya or samanyikrut kar diya
 lekin, bhale hi darwin ke kaary ko padhane ke baad unhone darwin kii avadharana ke liye apni swayan kii shabdaawalee ke rup main vaakyansh 'sarvshereshth kii uttarjivita ' ko prastut kiya or aksar galat tareeke se unhen ek aisa vichaarak maan liya jaataa he, jisane darvinian siddhant ko samaaj par keval lagu kiya, lekin phir bhi unhone apane sampurna maujuuda tantra main prakritik chayan ko anichhaa se hi shaamil kiya tha
 His primary method of species conversion was the Lamarckist experiment-succession, which posited that organs develop or perish through organ use or application, and that these resulting changes can be transmitted to future generations as well
 spencer kaa maananaa tha ki kramik vikaas kii yah kaary-vidhi 'ucchtar' kramik vikaas kii vyakhya karne ke liye bhi aavashyak thi, visheshtah maanavtaa ke saamaajik vikaas ke liye
 iske alaava, darwin ke vipareet, unka maananaa tha ki kramik vikaas kii ek disha or ek antim-bindu tha, jo ki samatulyata kii prapti kii antim avasthaa he
 He attempted to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology
 unhone pratipaadit kiya ki samaaj nimnatar se ucchtar roopon main parivartan kaa parinaam he, thik vaise hi jaise yah kaha jaataa he ki jaivik kramik vikaas ke siddhant ke anusaar jivan ke nimnatam rup uchachat roopon main viksit hote hai
 Spencer claimed that the human mind had evolved gradually from the simple automatic reactions of lower animals to the process of reasoning in thoughtful humans
 spencer ke anusaar gyaan ke do prakaar the: vyakti dwaara praapt kiya gaya gyaan tathaa prajati dwaara praapt kiya gaya gyaan
 antargyaan, yaa achetan rup se siikhaa gaya gyaan, prajati kaa vanshaagat anubhav tha
 Spencer studied the original positivist sociology of Auguste Comte with great enthusiasm
 vigyaan ke ek darshanik, comte ne saamaajik-saanskrithik kramik vikaas kaa ek siddhant pratipaadit kiya tha, jiske anusaar samaaj kaa vikaas teen charnon ke ek saamaanya niyam ke dwaara hota he
 However, writing after various changes in biology, Spencer attempted to reconstruct social science in the context of evolutionary biology, rejecting the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism
 mote taur par spencer ke samajashasre kaa varnan saamaajik taur par darvinvaadee ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he 
 Spencer argued that the development of society is an example of the gradual development from simple, equal, homogeneity to complex, different, diversity
 unhone samaaj ke do prakaaron, aatankwaadi tathaa audyogic, kaa ek siddhant viksit kiya, jo ki kramik vikasvaadi pragati ke anuroop tha
 The militant society, whose structure consisted of hierarchical and obedient relations, was simple and uniform; Industrial society, which was based on voluntary, contractually accepted social obligations, was complex and varied
 samaaj, jise spencer ne ek 'saamaajik praani' mana tha, kramik vikaas ke saarvbhaumik niyam ke anusaar saraltar avasthaa se adhik jatil avasthaa main kramik rup se viksit hua
 Furthermore, industrial society was a direct descendant of the ideal society developed in social statistics, although Spencer no longer explicitly expressed whether society would result in anarchism or whether it would have informed a continued role of the state
 Is, however, a role that would have been limited to the minimum functions of enforcement of contracts and external security

 The psychological - and hence also moral - structure that has been inherited by our ancestors to the present generation, and which we will pass on to our future generations, was in the process of progressively adopting the needs of residence in society
 udhaaharan ke liye, aakraamakata uttarjivita se judaa ek antargyaan tha, jo jivan kii praathmik sthitiyon ko aavashyak tha, lekin unnat samaajon main ise apnaanaa anaavashyak ho gaya
 chunki maanviya antargyaan kaa mastishk ke utakon ke reshon main vishisht sthaan tha, atah vah prayog-uttaradhikaar kii lemarkwaadi kriyavidhi ke adheen tha, taaki kramik parivartan bhavi pidiyon main sthanantarit kiye ja saken
 anek pidiyon ke bitne ke saath hi, kramik vikaas kii prakriya yah sunishchit karegi ki manushya kam aakraamak or vriddhishil rup se parahitvaadi bane, jiske parinamswaroop antat ek sampurna samaaj kaa nirmaan hoga, jisamen koi bhi vyakti kisi anya vyakti ko dukh nahin pahunchayegaa
 However, in order to build a complete person through gradual development, it was necessary that present and future generations experience the 'natural' consequences of their behavior
 Only in this way will individuals get the necessary motivation to do the work of self-improvement and thus provide an advanced moral formation to their heirs
 Therefore, anything that creates a disruption between the 'natural' relationship of behavior and its consequences must be stopped and this includes the exercise of the state's deterrent power to eradicate poverty, provide public education, or mandate compulsory vaccination
 haalanki, dharmarth daan ko protsaahit kiya janaa tha, lekin use bhi is vichaar ke dwaara simit kiya janaa tha ki manushyon ko dukh aksar unke kaaryon ke parinamswaroop hi praapt hote hai
 Hence, excessive altruism directed towards the 'unqualified poor' of individuals would break the link between behavior and consequences, which Spencer believed to be the basic requirement to ensure that the gradual development of humanity continues at a higher level of development
 spencer ne antim mulya kaa ek upyogvaadi maanak apanaaya-sarvaadhik sankhya kii sarvaadhik prasannataa-or unke anusaar kramik vikaas kii prakriya kaa charambindu upyogita kaa mahattam moolyankan hoga

 'swatantraaa' se aashay avapeedan kii anupasthiti se tha or yah nijee sampatti ke adhikaar se gaharaai se judi hui thi
 Spencer called this law of conduct 'ultimate ethics', which provided a scientifically grounded system of ethics that would replace the supernatural-based ethics systems of the past
 However, he recognized that the moral formation we inherited does not yet allow us to deal in full conformity with the laws of ultimate ethics and that is why we need a rule of 'relative ethics' In which the distortive factors of our present imperfection have also been considered
 sangieshasre par spencer kaa vishisht drushtikon bhi unke nitishasre se judaa hua tha
 Spencer thought that the origins of music can be traced to the eloquent oratory
 vaktaa pratyayakari prabhaav daalate hai, na keval unke shabdon kii tarkshiltaa ke dwaara, balki unke lahaze or swaraghaat ke dwaara bhi-jaisaa ki spencer ne ise vyakt kiya, unke swar ke sangitamay gun "buddhi ke vaakyon par bhaawanaaon kii tippanee" ke rup main kaary karte hai
 Music, considered to be an advanced development of his characteristic of oratory, contributes to the education and development of ethics of the species
 "hamaare bheetar dhun or lay se prabhavit hone kii jo vicitra kshamta he, main shaayad ye donon baaten nihit hai ki un ativ prasantaaon kaa ahsaas kar paanaa hamaare swabhaav kii sambhaavnaaon ke bheetar he, tathaa yah ki kisi na kisi tareeke se ve unki prastuti se sambandhit hai
 If so, the power and meaning of music become perceptible; But otherwise they are a mystery
 " In Spencer's final years his initial optimism appeared to be eroding and was replaced by a pessimism about the future of humans

 Spencer's reputation among the Victorians is largely attributed to his agnosticism
 unhone dharamshasre ko 'dharmanishtha kaa dikhaava karne waalon kii naastikta' kaa pratinidhi kahkar asweekaar kar diya

 Spencer argued that whether we start with religious belief or with science, eventually we have to accept some essential, but literally unthinkable assumptions
 chaahe ham kisi nirmaataa ke prati chintit hon yaa us adhbstar ke prati, jo tathyon ke hamaare anubhav ke neeche sthit he, ham isaki sankalpana kaa koi khaakaa nahin khinch sakate
 spencer kaa nishkarsh tha ki isiliye, dharm or vigyaan is param satya ko sweekaar karte hai ki maanviya samaj keval 'saapeksh' gyaan ko samaj paane main hi sakasham he
 This is because, due to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to gain knowledge of the facts, not the reality below the facts
 Therefore, both science and religion should accept that 'of all the facts, it is most certain that the power we see in the universe, and is completely inaccessible
 ' ise unhone 'agyeya' kaa bodh kaha or unhone agyeya kii upasna ko paaramparik dharm kaa sthaan lene main sakasham sakaaratmak vishwaas ke rup main prastut kiya
 In fact, he was of the view that the agnostic represents the final stage in the gradual development of religion, the final removal of its final anthropomorphic remains

 Spencer argued that the state is not a "necessary" institution and would "decay" if the oppressive aspects of the state were replaced by the voluntary market organization
 He also argued that the individual had "the right to ignore the state

 The expression 'there is no alternative', which was brought to prominence by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, can be traced to its strenuous use by Spencer

 Spencer is sometimes credited with the Social Darwinist model applied to the law of survival of the best of society

 According to a review of the JSTOR English-language database, the terminology "social Darwinism" was first used in an English-language academic journal in a book review of 1895 by Frank Tossig, a Harvard economist
 The data of JSTOR suggest that this term was used only 21 times before 1931

 His ideas were introduced by the Chinese scholar Yen Fu, who felt his writing was a recipe for the reform of the Qing state

 Spencer also had a great influence on literature and oratory
 In his 1852 essay, "the Philosophy of Style", a growing trend of the formist type of writing was discovered
 kisi angrezi vaakya ke bhaagon ke upyukt sthaan va kram par atyadhik kendrit rahete hue unhone prabhavi lekhan ke liye ek maargdarshika kii rachana kii

 spencer ne tark diya ki lekhak kaa adarsh "vichaaron ko is prakaar prastut karnaa he, taaki pathak unhen nunatam sambhav maansik prayaas ke dwaara samaj sake
" He argued that by making the meaning as accessible as possible, the writer would achieve the highest possible communicative efficiency
 According to Spencer, this can be done by placing all the clauses, objects and phrases before the subject of a sentence, so that by the time the reader reaches the subject, they have already had all the information necessary to fully understand its significance
 Although the overall impact of "genre philosophy" on the field of oratory was not as widespread as his contributions to other fields, Spencer's tone lent effective support to the metaphorical approaches to oratory

 Hg Wells used Spencer's ideas as the subject of his short novel, The Time Machine, and was applied to explain the gradual evolution of humans as two species
 Perhaps the best example of Spencer's ideas and influence of writing is that his reach was so diverse

 Gradually, Ganga realizes that Rajiv is not the person Arjuna portrayed him in India

 But because of his loyalty to Kishori Lal, he encourages her to continue the engagement and later worries about changing Rajiv

 Acid is a chemical compound which dissolves in water to give hydrogen ions

 According to the modern definition given by Johannes Nicholas Bronstedt and Martin Laurie, acid is the chemical compound that provides hydrogen ions to the repulsive compound
 jaise- asitic amla or salphurik amla 
 amla, thos, drav yaa gas, kisi bhi bhautik avasthaa main paae ja sakate hai
 They can live in pure form or in slurry form
 jis padaarth yaa yogic main amla ke gun paae jate hai ve kehalaate hai
 Acidity or acidity is a disease caused by excess of hydrochloric acid in the human bowel
 amla un padaarthon ko kehete hai jo pani main ghulne par khattey swaad ke hote hai, haldi se bani roli ko pilaa kar dete hai,tathaa inkaa jaleey vilyan nile litmus paper ko laal karata he
 Most metals react with hydrogen to produce gas, and neutralize the base
 mote hisaab se ksharak un padaarthon ko kehete hai jinka vilyan chikna-chikna sa lagata he, swaad kadva hota he, haldi ko laal kar dete hai or amlon ko udasin karte hai
 To neutralize means to make a substance which has neither the properties of acid nor of base
 lavaazie ne oxygen ke gunon kaa adhyayan karte samay dekha ki carbon, gandhak or phosphorus sadrush tatv jab oxygen main jalte hai tab unase bane oxide jal ke saath milakar amla banaate hai
 They reached the result that there is oxygen in acids and oxygen is the cause of acidic acid
 isi kaaran is gas kaa naam "oxygen" padaa, jiskaa arth hota he "amla banaanevaala padaarth" tathaa isi kaaran german bhashaa main oxygen ko "sir staf" arthath amla padaarth kehete hai
 Lavaziye divided acids into two classes, inorganic acids and organic acids
 peeche dekha gaya ki kuch tatwon ke oxide pani main ghulkar amla nahin balki kshar banaate hai or kuch amlon main oxygen bilkul nahin hota
 Bertile invented hydrocyanic acid in 1787, Davy invented hydrochloric acid in 1810–11 and hydriodic acid in 1813
 inamen se kisi main oxygen nahin he
 It has been observed later that the substances which are completely dry do not have any acidic reaction
 tab logon ne amlon ko do virgon main vibhakt kiya, ek hydro-amla or doosraa oxy-amla
 Back in 1815, Dewey suggested that the acidicity of acids is not due to oxygen, but due to hydrogen

 Acids do not have any properties that we can call specific characteristics of acids
 saadhaaran gun upar bataae ja chuke hai
 In acid and metal reactions, one, or more, hydrogen atoms of an acid molecule are displaced by metals, metal oxides, hydroxides or carbonates
 aise bhi kuch amla hai jo khattey hone ke badale mithe hote hai
 One such acid is amido-phosphoric acid
 kuch aise bhi amla hai jo ksharhar nahin hote
 There are also some alkalis whose hydrogen is displaced by metals
 fitkaree amla nahin he
 There is also no hydrogen to be displaced
 par yah swaad main khatta or kriya main ksharhar hota he
 It also turns blue litmus to red
 isi prakaar sodium baislphide khatta or ksharhar hota he
 It turns blue litmus red
 isamen visthapit honevaala hydrogen bhi he, par yah amla nahin he
 Methane is not an acid, but its hydrogen is displaced by zinc and thus zinc is dimethyl which is not a salt
 at: amla kii koi santoshprad paribhaasha ab tak nahin di ja saki he
 If we want to define acids on the basis of ion theory, then we can say that hydrogen ions are essential in acids
 silavian ne san 1659 main pehle pahal amlon or ksharakon main vibhed kiya tha
 In 1774, Rul gave the name base, which combines with acids to form salts
 aajkal ksharak un oxygen vaale padaarthon ko kehete hai jo amlon ke poorak hote hai
 Alkali metals, alkali metals and other metal oxides and all those things are alkalis which combine with acids to form salts
 aarambh main ksharak keval un dhaatuon athwa dhaatuon ke oxidon ke liye vyavahrat hota tha jo lavenon ke "base" yaa aadhaar the
 The bases of salts are essential components
 ksharak vastav main ve padaarth hai jo amla ke saath milakar lavan or jal banaate hai
 For example, zinc oxide combines with sulfuric acid to form zinc sulfate and water
 daahak soda salfurik amla ke saath milakar sodium sulphate or jal banaata he
 Oxides of metals are generally base
 par iske apwaad bhi hai
 The bases contain metal oxides and hydroxides, but for convenience some groups of elements are also formed which combine with acids to form salts without water
 aise ksharakon main ammonia, hydraxylemin or phosphin hai
 Fluid dissolves ammonia but gives no color with phenolphthalein
 at: kahan tak yah ksharak kaha ja saktaa he, yah baat sandigdh he
 Although the definition of the base above is very unsatisfactory, it has not given a good definition
 ksharak or kshar paryaayavachi jaabd nahin hai
 All bases are bases but not all bases are bases
 kshar-dhaatuon ke oxide, jaise sodium oxide, jal main ghulkar hydraksaide banaate hai
 They are strongly basic
 kshareey mrudadhatuon ke oxide, jaise kellisyam oxide, jal main alp viley or alp kshareey hote hai
 Oxides of other metals do not dissolve in water and their hydroxides are made indirectly
 dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide ksharak hote hai
 Alkali metal oxides dissolve quickly in water
 kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main kam viley hote hai or kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main tanik bhi viley nahin hai
 Some nonmetal hydrides, such as hydrides of nitrogen and phosphorus are also consumed

 Europa is the fourth largest satellite of Jupiter, the fifth planet in our solar system
 iskaa vyas lagbhag 3,138 kimi he jo hamaare chandramaa se chand kilometre hi chota he
 Europa is spelled "europa" in English
 pracheen unani sutron ke anusaar europa ek phonikiyai raaj-mahila kaa naam tha
 Europa is mainly made of stone and its center is of iron
 isaki sataha pani kii barf kii bani hui he or puure saura mandal kii sab se samtal satahon main gini jaati he
 There are cracks on this surface but the striking craters are very few
 daraaron main bhi nai barf se bhari hui lagatee hai
 Looking at the surface, many scientists think that there will be a sea of water beneath it
 unki soch he ke jab bhi sataha kisi ulkapind ke girane se fatati he yaa usamen brihaspati ke jowarbhata bal kii kheenchaatani se daraaren padati hai, to neeche se sagar ke pani se sampark rakhane vaali garm barf upar aa jaati he or sakhti se jamkar ghaav bhar detaa he
 If there is indeed such an ocean then it is possible that life is flourishing in it
 is sambhaavna kii vajah se europe or america kii antariksh kshodh agenciyaan europa par or anusandhan karne kii yojanaayen bana rahi hai
 Scientists also estimate that Europa's hard snow surface has turned 80 ° since its formation billions of years ago
 is se yah shankaa or teevr hoti he kii satahi barf kaa khol ek pani ke gole ke upar tair rahaa he or aaraam se hill-dul saktaa he
 Other scientists say that there is no such sea and that there is only soft ice beneath the hard ice outside - but scientists who believe so are few
 yadi vastav main samudr he to uski gaharaai 100 kimi tak ho sakati he
 This sea will have more than twice the water of all the seas of the earth

 Europa has a very thin atmosphere that contains mostly molecular oxygen
 is vaayu kii taadaad itani kam he ke prithvi par vaayu kaa dabaav europa se das kharab guna zyaada he
 There are many proposals to send a spacecraft around Europa to look at it from space
 uske alaava ek aisa bhi prastaav he ke ek yaan ko europa par utaara jaae
 The vehicle will have a heat-generating part of the nuclear power that will melt the surface ice and sink into Europe until it either enters the ocean or proves that there is no such sea 
 kyonki vaigyanik maanate hai ke upree barf kii sataha 10 kimi se adhik moti he isliye is yaan ko samudr tak pahunchne ke liye bahut gaharaai tak dhansana hoga
 It will also be necessary to have enough broadcast power so that even under such depth of snow, it can send messages and pictures
 is yaan main aisi qabaliyat bhi hogi ki vah swayan hi samudr main ghumta rahe or apni disha chun sake kyonki prithvi se us tak nirdesh pahunchne main kuch minute lagenge

 rashtriya hit se aashay kisi desh ke aarthik, sainik, samskruthik lakshyon evam mahatvakakshaon se he
 The national interest occupies an important place in international politics, as they have a special role in building mutual relations between states
 kisi bhi raashtra kii videsh niti multah rashtriya hiton par hi aadhaarit hoti he, atah uski safaltaaon evam asafalataaon kaa moolyankan bhi rashtriya hiton main parivartan aata he jiske parinamswaroop videsh niti bhi badlaav ke daur se guzarati he
 It is mandatory to define them before any other information related to national interests, which is as follows- vibhinn vidwaanon ne rashtriya hiton ko kai shreniyon main baanta he
 For example, scholars classify them into first class interest, secondary interest, permanent interest, temporary interest, general interest, specific interest, etc
 lekin multah inhen do pramukh shreniyon main rakhana zyada spasht chithran prastut karata he - As far as major interests are concerned, each nation sets its foreign policy objectives based on three major interests
 ye teen pramukh hit hai It is necessary to have these three factors in the major objectives of each nation, because the basic premise / existence of the state rests on the first
 duusare par uskaa sucharu vikaas tathaa tisare kaa mahatv isliye he ki in hiton kii purti ek vishisht vishwa parivesh main hi sambhav he, ekaantavaas main nahin
 Therefore, any nation establishes its foreign policy or reciprocal relationship with states only in the context of these three major interests
 gaun hit pramukh hiton kii bhaanti mahatvapurn to nahin hote lekin kisi bhi raashtra ko satta main banaaye rakhane hetu aavashyak hote hai
 For these interests, the nation is not ready to go to its common or wars, but still tries to fulfill them
 in hiton ke madhyam se raashtra apane saamaajik, saanskrithik, viraasat aadi dwaara sthapit aakankshaon kii purti karata he
 Additionally, tries to complete its overseas operations
 inke madhyam se videshon main based apane nagarikon ke hiton kii purti ke prayaas bhi karata he
 Therefore, to fulfill these interests, the nations also make great efforts
 parantu jaisaa upar kaha he ki kul milakar rashtrahit gatisheel hote hai, sthai nahi
 That is why the nation keeps trying to fulfill as many possible interests as possible
 rashtriya hiton ke sandarbh main jo bhi baaten kahi jaae, antatah satya yah he ki sabhi raashtra inaki abhivruddhi hetu bharsak praytn karte hai
 In this context, nations use various means, the main of which are: kisi bhi raashtra kii videsh niti kaa karyanvayan rajnay ke madhyam se hi hota he
 Diplomacy is not in itself moral, immoral but is in accordance with its national interests
 na hi yah ek vastunishth sthiti he, balki yah vyaktiparak vyavastha he jiskaa akalan prayek raashtra apane-apane drushtikon ke antargat karata he
 Diplomacy is implemented in accordance with the involvement of the Ministry of External Affairs, political leadership, and many other individuals and institutions in addition to the embassies and commerce centers established abroad
 rajnay dwi-paksheeya evam bahupaksheeya donon prakaar ke hote hai
 The forms of diplomacy are also presented in new contexts according to the conditions
 prachaar bhi rashtriya hiton main vruddhi evam purti kaa mahatvapurn tarika he
 Propaganda has always been a way of falsifying the arguments of other nations and spreading its point, but it is only in the 20th century that propaganda has been used as a main tool
 iskaa ati spasht rup do vishwa yudhon ke bich ke kaal main dekhne ko mila jab vibhinn vichaardhaaraon - samyawad, najeevaad, fasism - ke madhyamon se rashtron ne apni shakti sthapit evam sanvardhan hetu inkaa upyog kiya
 Even in the Cold War period, both the superpowers created competition among the nations to adopt the norms of communist and capitalist development to build their respective hegemony
 shityudhottar yug main bhi ek maatr shakti dwaara bhoomandaleekaran, udaarikaran, mukt bazaar vyavastha aadi keval rashtron ke paas bache vikalp ke rup main tathaa apni videsh niti kii hastkshep kii nitiyon ko nyyochit sthapit karne hetu atyadhik prachaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Thus, there has been considerable use of propaganda in the last century for two major reasons
 pehla kaaran rahaa he sanchaar sadhano main ai kranti jisane prachaar ko bahut shighrata, vishwasaneey va aasaani se uplabdh kara diya
 Secondly, the abolition of the use of force from the origin of ultra-modern weapons has also made this tool more important
 kaaran jo bhi rahe hon parantu vartmaan main uplabdh sanchaar kranti ke tareekon ne prachaar ko videsh niti ke prabhavi tantra ke rup main prastut kiya he
 Political warfare has also been an important tool for the promotion of national interests
 yah na to yuddh he parantu na hi shaanti
 By this, through diplomacy, creating punitive conditions or imposing economic restrictions between the states, which keeps the pressure on the opponents
 vartmaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti main vibhinn tareekon dwaara rajnatik yuddh kii sthiti paidaa kii jaati he - The present era is an era of interdependence
 prayek raashtra, kitna hi shaktishaalee ho yaa kitna hi chota ho, sabhi ko paraspar ek duusare par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 No one is completely self dependent
 parantu prayek raashtra apane rashtriya hiton kii purti hetu ve raashtra apane sansadhano ke bal par apane rashtriya hiton kii abhivruddhi karte hai
 By using these resources, the big powers succeeded in establishing military bases abroad, changing power in developing countries, obtaining cheap raw materials, influencing the policies of weak nations, devaluing the currency of states, fixing the terms of trade, etc
 She does it
 is sandarbh main aarthik rup se shaktishaalee raashtra anya deshon ke prati do prakaar ke sadhano kaa prayog karte hai - mukhya aarthik tantra tathaa gaun aarthik tantra
 The main economic system is used in the following ways - gaun aarthik tantra ke aadhaar par prayukt hone vaale sadhano ke antargat - riyasat, bahishkaar, nakebandi aate hai
 It is through these economic means that nations increase their national interests
 1945 se purv atyaadhik badi shaktiyon ne samrajyavad kaa sahaara lekar apane rashtriya hiton kii abhivruddhi kii thi
 In general, when a nation forcibly occupies the borders and people of another state, it is called imperialism
 isaki vyakhya hetu alag-alag vidwaanon ne alag-alag siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 The form of imperialism can be seen in many forms
 yah bade rajyon dwaara kabhi aarthik kaarnon, yathasthiti banaaye rakhane, rashtriya pratishtha aadi kai kaarnon se prerit hoti he
 Through the policies of imperialism, nations get economic benefits, power building and welfare of underdeveloped countries etc
 isse shaktiyon ke rashtriya hiton kii purti hoti he
 But if it is seen in reality, imperialism leads to exploitation, injustice, backwardness, poverty, starvation etc
 of most of the nations to serve the interests of a few nations
 isliye 1945 ke baad ke varshon main kshetreey samrajyavad samaapt praaia ho gaya he
 Through colonialism, in the 18th and 19th centuries, large forces of Europe ruled most of the countries of the Third World
 iske antargat videshi rajyon par bahya shaktiyon kaa shashan chalaaya jaataa rahaa he jo sthaneey logon ke sabhi vishyon par apana niyantran rakhte hai
 The entire political system was in his hands
 sarkaar videshi takaton dwaara hi chalaai jaati thi
 External powers also controlled the terrain
 sthaneey logon kii swatantrataayen bhi unheen ke ishaare par chalati thi
 But the long struggle of the freedom movement liberated everyone in the 1950s and 1960s and often ended the colonial system
 1945 ke baad upniveshwaad kaa sthaan 'nav upniveshwaad' ne grahan kar liya
 Now states became independent regionally and politically, but still remained slaves economically
 aarthik sansadhano kii drushti se 30 pratishat jansankhya 70 pratishat sansadhano kaa upyog karti he tathaa 70 pratishat janata maatr 30 pratishat sansadhano kaa prayog karti hai
 Even today the prices of raw materials, trade terms, economic exchanges, technical transfers, etc
 are all against third world countries
 ab in rashtron kaa shoshan apratyaksh rup se hone laga he
 Today, developed countries are still exploiting developing states through multinational companies, financial assistance, import of investment raw materials and export of ready-made goods, second-rate technology transfer, etc
 vibhinn gaiyr jaruri muddon jaise bal shram, paryaavaran, maanavadhikaar aadi ke naam par aaj bhi inke saath vyapaarik va anya aarthik sambandhon main bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, due to these economic benefits, powerful nations are fulfilling and promoting their national interests
 yuddh ko bhi antim vikalp ke rup main raashtra apane rashtriya hiton ke sanvardhan hetu prayog kar lete hai
 Wars have different causes and different forms
 parantu vartmaan yug main hathiyaaron kii maarak kshamta evam unke vidhvansak swaroop ke kaaran raashtra yudhon ke prayog se bachate hai, parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki yudhon kaa tyaag kar diya gaya
 Even today, the big powers do not miss its use to serve their national interests
 udhaaharan ke rup main vartmaan samay main bhi america ne afghanistan va iraq par yuddh karke apni ekmaatr varchasv vaali mahashakti hone kaa parichay diya
 Therefore, through the above mentioned means, the powers keep increasing their national interests
 yah shakti sanvardhan shantipurna tareekon se lekar yuddh tak ke anek nirdhaaran tatwon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 But in the present era of interdependence, the national interests of some nations are promoted at the expense of other states
 isiilie rashtron ko apni videsh niti kaa aadhaar banaate samay duusare rashtron ke hiton ko bhi dekhnaa chahie
 Similarly, far-reaching and continuous peace and security can be established in the world by the use of national interests

 Fahyan also mentions Ayodhya in his description
 aaj kii avadhi pravaas or samskruthikaran ke chalate khadi boli or angreji ke prabhaav main aa rahi he
 In the west of Awadhi lies the Bundeli and Braj of the western section, Chhattisgarhi in the south and Bhojpuri dialect in the east
 iske uttar main nepal kii tarai he jisamen tha degree aadi adivaasiyon kii bastiyaan hai jinaki bhashaa avadhi se bilkul alag he
 The variation of Awadhi from Hindi Khadiboli is mainly grammatical
 isamen karta kaarak ke parasarg "ne" kaa nitant abhaav he
 Other forms often have two forms - Harsva and long
 
 Like the standing of nouns, there are two distinctions - vikari and invariant
 avikari vibhakti main sangya kaa mul rup rahata he or vikari main bahuvachan ke liye "na" pratyay jod diya jaataa he 
 At the end of consonant nouns in the invariable form of doer and karma, in some dialects there is a praise of a "u"
 kintu nishchay hi yah purna swar nahin he or bhashavigyaani ise fusfusaahat ke swar-hrasv "i" or hrasv "e" milte hai
 Nouns often have two forms, hrasva and long
 inke atirikt avadhi kshetra ke purvi bhaag main ek or rup-dirghatar miltaa he 
 At some places in Awadhi, the form of khadiboli has disappeared; Belaia, Debia, etc
 are not available in the form of cat, box etc
 sarvnaam main khadiboli or braj ke "meraa tera" or "mero tero" rup ke liye avadhi main "mor tor" rup hai
 Apart from these, "aw" in Western Awadhi derives from "so" "jo" "" parallel to "" "J" "K"
 kriya main bhavishyakaal roopon kii prakriya khadiboli se bilkul bhinn he
 In Khadiboli, forms are often made by adding ga-ge-gay to the modern forms of ancient present
 braj main bhavishyat ke rup pracheen bhavishyatkaal ke roopon par aadhaarit hai
 
 avadhi main praaia: bhavishyat ke rup tavyat pratyyant pracheen roopon par ashrith hai 
 In the western dialects of Awadhi, only the forms of Uttam Purusha plural depend on poetical forms
 shesh braj kii tarah pracheen bhavishyat par
 But in the intermediate and eastern dialects, there has been an increase in the prevalent forms of dissimilar forms
 kriyaarthak sangya ke liye khadiboli main "naa" pratyay he or braj main "no" 
 But "B" is the suffix for it in Awadhi
 avadhi main nishtha ekvachan ke rup kaa "vaa" main ant hota he 
 In Bhojpuri, the place ending in "L" is found in its place
 avadhi kaa ek mukhya bhedak lakshan he anypurush ekvachan kii sakarmak kriya ke bhootkaal kaa rup 
 y - The forms ending in "si" are not found elsewhere except Awadhi
 avadhi kii sahaayak kriya main rup "ha", "ah" or "baati" par aadhaarit hai
 According to the above symptoms, three classes of dialects of Awadhi are considered: Western, Intermediate and Eastern
 pashchimi boli par nikatataa ke kaaran braj kaa or purvi par bhojpuri kaa prabhaav he
 Apart from these, the Bagheli dialect has its own existence
 vikaas kii drushti se avadhi kaa sthaan braj, kannauji or bhojpuri ke bich main padataa he
 Braj is definitely derived from Shaurseni and Magadhi Prakrit of Bhojpuri
 avadhi kii sthiti in donon ke bich main hone ke kaaran iskaa ardhamagadhi se nikalnaa maananaa uchit hoga
 Sadly, the oldest form of Ardhamagadhi that we find is of the fifth century AD and it is difficult to derive the form of Avadhi
 pali bhashaa main bahudhaa aise rup milte hai jinase avadhi ke roopon kaa vikaas siddh kiya ja saktaa he
 Probably these forms may have been of the ancient Ardhamagadhi

 Goswami Tulsidas's "ramcharitmanas" in Bhaktikavya is the major work of Awadhi literature

 The sequence of couplets which is in "padmavat" is often found in "manas"

 The tradition of this poem continued for several hundred years

 In terms of terminology, these compositions differ from the texts of Hindu poets in that they do not have the same abundance of Sanskrit words
 pracheen avadhi sahitya main adhiktar rachanaayen deshprem, samajasudhar aadi vishyon par or mukhya rup se vyangyatmak hai
 Among the poets are Pratapnarayan Mishra, Balabhadra Dixit "padhis", Vanshidhar Shukla, Chandrabhushan Dwivedi "ramai Kaka", Guru Prasad Singh "mrigesh" and Shardaprasad "bhushundi"
 prabandh kii parampara main "ramcharitamanas" ke dhang kaa ek mahatvapurn aadhunik granth dwarikaprasad mishra kaa "krishnayan" he
 Its language and style is similar to that of "manas" and the author has written Krishnacharita, often with the same intensity and detail as Tulsidas's Ramcharit, which is written by Tulsidas
 mishra ji ne is granth kii rachana dwaara yah siddh kar diya he ki prabandh ke liye avadhi kii prakruti aaj bhi waisi hi upadey he jaisi tulsidas ke samay main thi

 hazaribagh ke padmama se nikalate hue, yah chota nagpur pathaar ke uttari bhaag main bahati hui, disrgad, vardaman main damodar nadi se mil jaati he
 It has a catchment area of 6,159 km 2
 The main tributaries, Barsoti and Usri, flow in from the south and north respectively
 Apart from the two main tributaries some fifteen medium / small streams join it
 The Barakar skirts the northern portion of Parasnath Hills,, the highest hill in the region, located in Giridih district of Jharkhand and a centre of Jain pilgrimage
 The river flows in all fury during the rains in its upper reaches and has washed away two bridges constructed successively on the Grand Trunk Road
 The great stone bridge across the river near Barhi, in Hazaribagh district, built around 1848, was washed away in 1913, after a fall of 10 inches of rain in 24 hours
 The narrow iron bridge, which was built to replace it, withstood the strains of troop movement during the Second World War, but gave way in 1946, with another great flood
 a new bridge built in the fifties has withstood the fury of the river
 There is another bridge on the Grand Trunk Road, across the Barakar, connecting Barakar, a small town bearing the same name in Bardhaman district of West Bengal with Chirkunda in Jharkhand
 With heavy traffic in the heart of the coal belt, the bridge built in the mid–19th century is in need of repairs
 a new bridge has been built, to the north, on the bypass running from Kalipahari, before entering Asansol to Nirsa in Dhanbad district
 The huge volume of monsoon water was carried down the valley and used to create havoc with floods in the lower Damodar basin
 Annual rainfall over the basin varies between 765 and 1,607 mm with an average of 1200 mm of which 80% occurs during the monsoon season from June to September
 In order to harness the river, the Damodar Valley Corporation planned and implemented independent India's first multipurpose river valley project
 The first dam of the project was constructed across the Barakar at Tilayia
 dvc’s first dam, Tilaiya Dam, was across the Barakar at Tilaiya, in Hazaribagh district of Bihar, now in Koderma district of Jharkhand
 It was inaugurated on 21 farvari 1953
 The dam is 366 meter long and is 30
18 meter high from the river bed level
 Tilaiya hydel power station is located on the left bank of the river Barakar
 The structure is entirely of reinforced concrete
 It has two generating units of 2 MW each with a provision for a third future unit of the same capacity
 dvc's second dam was across the Konar River, a tributary of the Damodar, in Hazaribagh district, and the third was across the Barakar at Maithon in Dhanbad district of Bihar, now Jharkhand
 The river forms the boundary between West Bengal and Jharkhand in that area
 The dam was inaugurated on 27 September 1957
 The dam is 4,860 meters long and the concrete dam is 43
89 meters high above the river bed level
 The unique feature of Maithon is that the hydel power station is located underground in the left bank of the river and is the first of its kind in India
 The Power Station has a total generating capacity of 60 MW with three units of 20 MW each
 About 13 km downstream from Maithon, the Barakar joins the Damodar at Dishergarh
 Maithon Dam is 48 km from Dhanbad and around 25 km from Asansol
 Other towns such as Rupnarainpur, Chittaranjan and kulti-barakar-neamatpur-dishergarh lie still nearer
 It receives a steady and daily stream of tourists
 In order to augment the meagre hydroelectric power generation DVC has gone in for both gas turbine and thermal power generation
 While most of its facilities for such generation lie in the Damodar region, Maithon in the Barakar regions is a major focal point
 Maithon Gas Turbine Station was commissioned at Maithon in 1989
 The station has an installed capacity of 82
5 MW with three units each of 27
5 MW capacity
 The 2 x 500 MW Maithon Right Bank thermal power station is under implementation
 It is a joint venture of Tata Power and DVC
 a 2 x 500 MW greenfield thermal power station has been proposed for Koderma
 DVC is working on the proposal for a third dam across the Barakar at Balpahari in Jharkhand
 Planned as part of its network of dams and barrages in the valley region, the Balpahari project was conceived with the objective of reducing siltation problems at Maithon, increasing the reach of canal irrigation and adding to hydro-electric generation capacity by 20 MW from the existing 144 MW
 After the construction of the four dams at Tilayia, Konar, Maithon and Panchet by DVC, it was observed that the rate of silt inflow into the reservoirs were much higher than what was anticipated earlier
 It threatened the longevity of the reservoirs
 The catchment area of these reservoirs spread over the undulating terrain of the Chota Nagpur plateau is seriously affected by soil erosion
 Large volume of silt in the form of coarse and fine sediment is removed from the area by erosion under the impact of the water flow caused by torrential rain, which runs down the numerous stream channels during the monsoon
 Thus the problem of reservoir siltation assumed great importance in the case of DVC
 In order to prolong the life of the reservoirs, there was need for soil conservation and silt control
 DVC set up a Soil Conservation Department at Hazaribagh to tackle the twin problems of reservoir siltation and soil deterioration in 1949
 The reservoirs at Tilaiya and Maithon, provided scope for development of fisheries
 Efforts were made to introduce carps once the water accumulated behind the dams but the results have not been commensurate with the efforts, largely due to the formidable presence of predatory catfish W
 attu and other predators such as Notopterus chitala and Barilius bola at Tilaiya, and catfishes Wallago attu and Aorichthys aor, at Maithon
 These predators take a heavy toll of the stocked carps Trash and uneconomic fishes form dense population at Tilaiya reservoir, competing with major carps for food
 Composition of catch at both the places is: catla, mrigala, rohita and calbasu

 In various countries of the world, the term Industrial Court has been used in many ways
 ek saadhaaran vyakti ise nyaayalay samajhataa he jahaan vibhinn prakaar ke audyogic vidhaanon ke kaaran utpann maamalon kii sunwaayee hoti he, kintu vastav main yah nyaayalay nahin he
 It is an organization where employment related matters, industrial events, mutual and dividend etc
 are referred for panchayat or settlement with mutual consent of the government or related parties
 san 1915 main britain main sarkari panchpranali kaa nyaayaadhikaran sthapit hua, jisase is prakaar ke nyaayalayon kii neenv padi
 After the Industrial Courts Act was approved in 1919, the Tribunal of the Governmental Panchayat system was reconstituted and named as Industrial Court
 jab maamle is nyaayalay main bheje jate the tab vah unpar apana nirnay detaa tha
 These decisions were formally considered valid for common parties, yet if the parties did not accept them, there was no system to accept them
 pichley donon mahayudhkalon main is prakaar ke nyaayalay un deshon main sthapit ho chuke the jahaan udyog paryaapt viksit ho chuke the
 At that time it appeared that a regular means of compromise was necessary in industrial disputes
 audyogic-vivaad-vidhaan kaa itihaas bharat main utana pracheen nahin he jitna anyaanya udyogpradhan deshon main, kyonki vyapak rup se audyogic hadataalen is desh main samanyat: prachlit nahin thim
 On the basis of the British Industrial Court Act of 1919, the Government of India sought to approve a law in relation to industrial disputes in 1920, but it did not think it appropriate to start such work in the post-turbulent period of 1914-18
 iske atirikt britain main udyogon kii jo avasthaaen rahi hai ve bharat main prachlit avasthaaon se bhinn rahi hai
 Therefore, such thoughts had to be abandoned at that time
 san 1924 main bombai kii sooti milon main vyapak hadtaal hui
 The strike prompted the government to prepare a legislation
 falswaroop san 1929 main majdoor-vivaad-adhinium paarit kiya gaya
 In this act, there was a provision to establish a court of inquiry or a court of confession by the appropriate officer, who should enter into a settlement in the disputed matters
 jaanch adaalat ke jimme yah kaam rakhaa gaya ki vah maamle kii jaanch kar apni report prastut kare tathaa sanraadhan mandal us maamle main samjhauta karaane kaa prayaas kare
 Both of the above associations were not permanent
 iske atirikt, adhinium main audyogic vivaad rokane kii koi vyavastha bhi nahi thi
 The State Commission, which was set up on the question of labor, suggested that permanent officers should be appointed permanently by the State Government, who should be duty bound to make a settlement between the parties at the beginning in the event of industrial disputes
 san 1934 main ek sanshodhan dwaara san 1929 ke adhinium ko sthaayee rup diya gaya
 The above act was again amended in 1938 in relation to the definition of "labor dispute"
 sanshodhit adhinium ne is baat kii bhi vyavastha kii ki gaiyrkanoonee hadataalen or talabandi kam pratibandhaatmak hon
 Notwithstanding this, there was no permanent arrangement in the Act for the resolution of disputes, nor was it the arrangement that the decisions of the Samardhan Mandal or the Court of Inquiry were necessarily valid for both the parties
 san 1938 main bombai sarkaar ne bombai-audyogic-vivaad-adhinium paarit kiya
 The goal of this Act was to redress the errors of its earlier legislations
 san 1939 main bombai rajya main audyogic nyaayalay sthapit kar die gaye
 At the time of the Second World War, in 1942, an arrangement was made in the india-defense-rules, by which the government was empowered to make general or special rules to stop the strike and lockout and entrust any such dispute for conciliation or judicial decision
 Which hurts the public or hinders the task of completing war material
 in yudhkalin niyamon kii safalataa dekhakar bharat sarkaar ne san 1947 main san 1929 ke mul adhinium ke sthaan par audyogic-vivaad-adhinium paarit kiya
 The main provisions in the 1947 Act were: iske saath hi is adhinium dwaara sarkaar ko yah bhi adhikaar diya gaya ki vah sanraadhan adhikari niyukt kare jo audyogic vivaadon main samjhauta karaane kaa maarg nikaalen or aavashyaktaanusaar madhyasthata bhi karen
 The Samradhan Adhikari was empowered to resolve all disputes related to public utility service by the Panch system
 san 1947 ke adhinium ke antargat vibhinn nyaayaadhikrnon ne jo jo mat vyakt kiye ve aapas main mail nahin kha rahe the, kyonki unke bich sampark sthapit karanevaali koi sanstha nahin thi
 As a result, the Industrial Disputes Act was passed in 1950 and Appellate Tribunals were established in the country
 in nyaayaadhikrnon ko adhikaar mila ki ve vibhinn audyogic nyaayaadhikrnon dwaara die gaye nirnyon ke viruddh kii janevaali apilen sunen
 Amendments were made in the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 in 1952, 1953 and last in 1956, to compensate the workers in cases of uncontrolled leave and retrenchment
 iske saath hi shramjivi patrkaar bhi is vidhi ke antargat shramjivi maan liye gaye
 The Industrial Disputes Act of 1956 further broadened the definition of the term "proletarian" and replaced the earlier tribunal system with a three-tier system
 naveen tristareey pranali ke antargat shram nyaayalay, audyogic nyaayaadhikaran or rashtriya nyaayaadhikaran banaae gaye
 Separate legislations regarding industrial disputes also exist in the states of Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir to resolve common and special problems in their respective areas

 When the ENIAC was announced in 1946, it made headlines in the press under the name "giant Brain"
 isane vidyut-yantric mashiinon ke mukaable gati ko ek hazaar guna badha diya, computing shakti main yah ek aisi chalaang thi jisaki tulana koi bhi ekal mashin aaj tak nahin kar pai he

 ENIAC ek modular computer tha, jisamen vibhinn kaaryon ke liye vyaktigat panel shaamil the
 Twenty of these modules were accumulators, which not only did the addition and subtraction, but kept a ten-digit decimal number in memory
 sankhyaon ko in ikaayiyon ke bich kai saamaanya uddeshy bason, yaa trey par paar karavaaya jaataa tha
 To achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, calculate, preserve the response and start the next action, all without any moving part
 uske failaav kii kshamta uski bahumukhi pratibha kii kunjee thi; vah ek gananaa parinaam ke chihnon par nirbhar vibhinn kaaryon ko shuru karata tha
 Apart from speed, the most notable thing about ENIAC was its size and complexity
 The ENIAC included 17,468 vacuum tubes, 7200 crystal diodes, 1500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and about 5 million hand-held joints
 It weighed 30 short tons, was about 8
5 by 3 by 80 feet, took 680 square feet of space and consumed 150 kw of power
 ek IBM card reader se input sambhav tha or output ke liye ek IBM card panch kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 These cards are used to produce printed output in an offline state with the help of an IBM accounting machine, an example of which is the IBM 405
 ENIAC, ankon kaa bhandaaran karne ke liye das-sthetiya ring ganak kaa prayog karata tha; prayek ank 36 nirvaat tubon kaa istemaal karata tha, jinamein se 10 dohare tryod hote the jo ring ganak ke flip flop ko banaate the
 Arithmetic was accomplished by ring counters "counting" the pulse and generating a carry pulse if the pulse was "wrapped", the idea being that the operation of the numerical cycle of a mechanical adding machine was achieved in electronics Can go ENIAC main das-ank chihnit acumulator the jo das ke poorak pradarshan kaa prayog karte the or prayek second ek strot or unamem se kisi ke bhi bich 5,000 saamaanya jod yaa ghataav kar saktaa tha
 It was possible to combine multiple accumulators to run simultaneously, so the fastest speed of the task was probably too high due to parallel work
 ek acumulator ke kairi ko duusare acumulator main taar kii sahaayta se dohari parishuddh, ankaganit kaa pradarshan karne ke liye le janaa sambhav tha, lekin acumulator kairi circuit kaa samay nirdhaaran ucchtar parishuddhta ke liye teen yaa adhik taron ko jode jane par pabandi lagaataa tha
 ENIAC used four of the accumulators, controlled by a special multiplier unit, to perform multiplication operations of up to 385 per second
 ENIAC ne acumulatoron main se paanch kaa bhi upyog kiya, jo ek vishesh divyder / ank-mulak ikai dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa tha, taaki prati second chalis bhaag yaa teen varg-mul kaary kiye ja sake

 The original machine cycle was 200 microseconds, or 5,000 cycles per second to operate on a 10-digit number
 inamen se ek chakra main, ENIAC ek register par ek sankhya likh saktaa tha, ek register se ek sankhya pard saktaa tha, yaa do sankhyaon ko jod / gata saktaa tha
 a 10-digit number multiplied by a d-digit number d +4 cycles, a 10-digit multiplication by a 10 takes 14 cycles, or a rate of 2800 microseconds-357 per second
 yadi sankhyaon main se ek 10 se kam ank ho, to kaary teji se hota tha
 The quadratic and square root took 13 cycles, with d being the number of digits in the result
 isliye ek bhagaganit yaa ank mul 143 chakra tak, yaa 28,600 microsecond-35 prati second kii dar letaa tha
 If the result had less than ten digits, they were obtained faster
 ENIAC un dinon ke aam ashtadhari radio tubon kaa istemaal karte the; dashamalav acumulator 6SN7, flip-flop se bane hote the, jabaki 6l7s, 6sj7s, 6sa7s or 6ac7s kaa istemaal tark kaaryon main kiya jaataa tha
 Many 6l6s and 6v6s acted as line drivers to allow the pulses to pass through the cables between the rack assemblies
 kuch electronics visheshgyon kaa purvanumaan tha ki tub aksar kharaab hogi jiske kaaran mashin kabhi upyogi nahin hogi
 This prediction turned out to be partially correct: Almost every day several tubes were burned, which resulted in it not being able to work for half the time
 vishesh ucch-vishwasaneeyata vaale tub 1948 tak uplabdh nahin the
 However, most of these malfunctions occurred during warm-up and cool-down times, when tube heaters and cathodes were under the highest thermal stresses
 mashin ko kabhi band naa karne kii saadhaaran yukti ke saath ejiniyaron ne ENIAC ke tubon main kharabi ke dar ko gata kar ek tub prati do din kii dar par laa diya jo adhik sweekaarya tha
 According to an interview with Eckert in 1989, the stories of the tube continuously deteriorating were mostly a myth: "almost every two days a tube was damaged and we would have identified the problem in 15 minutes
 "1954 main, bina kisi kharabi ke prachaalan kaa lagaataar sabase lanbaa samay 116 ghante tha 
 As the ballistic research laboratory was sponsoring ENIAC for one year during this three-year project, a mathematician, John von Neumann, working on a hydrogen bomb in Los Alamos, came to know about the computer
 tatpashchaat los ellamos, ENIAC ke saath itnaa jud gaya ki usapar chalaaya gaya pehla samasya parikshan, topakhane kii talikaon ke bajaae hydrogen bam ke liye gananaa thi
 The input / output for this test was one million cards
 ENIAC ko prachaalan ke jatil anukramon ke liye programit kiya ja saktaa tha, jisamen pash, shakhaaen or upanemakaayen shaamil ho sakate the
 The task of taking a problem and mapping it to the machine was complex and usually took several weeks
 program ke kagaz par banaaye jane ke baad, switch or taron ke jodtod ke dwaara us program ko ENIAC ke "andar" daalane main kuch din or lagate the
 This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, with the ability to "single step" the machine

 In 1946, the names they called each other were mcnulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlene Weschoff, Fran Bilas, and Ruth Lichtermann
 Jennifer S
 Light's essay "when Computers Were Women" records and describes the historical omission or diminution of the role of women in the ENIAC as well as the role of women in the history of computer science
 ENIAC apane prakaar kii ek maatr dizin thi or ise kabhi doharaaya nahin gaya
 The ban on its design in 1943 meant that the lack of some innovations in computer design that soon developed well, especially the inability to store a program
 Eckert and Mauchly began work on a new design, later known as EDVAC, which would be simpler as well as more powerful
 vishesh rup se, 1944 main ekirt ne ek memri ikai ke vishay main apana vivaran likhaa jo data or program dono ko dhaaran kar saktaa tha
 John von Neumann, who was consulting for the Moore School at EDVAC, attended Moore School meetings detailing the stored program concept and wrote an incomplete set of notes intended to be used as an internal memo And in which the ideas developed in the meeting were described, elaborated and represented in a formal logical language
 harman goldstine ne first draft kii pratiyon ko sarkari or shaikshik sansthaaon main vitarit kiya, jiske kaaran EDSAC or SEAC jaise nai peedi ke electronic sanganana mashiinon ke nirmaan main vyapak dilchaspee utpann hui
 Several improvements have also been made to ENIAC since 1948, including an ancient read-only stored programming mechanism for which program roms were used as function tables, an idea independently proposed by Dr
 Richard Clippinger of BLR and ENIAC
 Included in the patent of
 clipinger ne anudesh ke set ko lagu karne par won neuman ke saath salaah kii
 Clippinger thought of a 3-address architecture, while von Neumann proposed a 1-address architecture because it was easy to implement
 ek acumulator ke teen ankon kaa program ganak ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa tha, ek anya acumulator kaa prayog mukhya acumulator ke rup hota tha, ek tisare acumulator ko kaary talika se data padhane ke liye ek pataa suchak ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa tha or anya acumulatoron main se adhikansh data memri ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 The programming for the archived program for ENIAC was done by Betty Jennings, Clippinger and Adele Goldstein
 16 sitambar 1948 ko, ise ek sangrahit-program computer ke rup main pradarshit kiya gaya, jisamen adel goldstine dwaara jon won neuman ke liye program chalaaya gaya
 This modification reduced the ENIAC speed by a count of six and eliminated the ability for parallel computation, but as it reduced the time of reprogramming from days to hours, its poor performance was considered reasonable

 In the first half of 1952, a high-speed shifter was added, which improved the transfer speed with a score of five

 kahani kii shruwaat main mukhya paatr henchard sharaab ke nashe main apni patni sujan ko meley main bech detaa he
 Uski sells his wife and daughter to a naval named Newson
 agle din jab use apni galati kaa ehsaas hot he, to vah jivan main kabhi sharaab ko haath na lagane kii kasam khaataa he
 After eighteen years, Hanchard appears as a slough merchant
 uskaa gussa or aakrosh ab bhi uske charitra kaa hissaa he
 Throughout the years, Henchard's past had remained a secret
 log henchard ko vidhur samajhte the, jabaki usne kabhi kisiko yah nahin kaha tha ki uski pehali patni kii mrityu ho chuki he
 In these eighteen years, it was better for Hanchard to assume that Susan and her daughter Elizabetha had died
 isi dauraan jab vah apne vyavsaay ke liye jersey jaataa tha, use luseta naamak ladkee se prem ho jaataa he
 When Henchard and Lucetta think of getting married, Susan and Elizabethe arrive after Athara to find her after years
 saath hi yahan par donald farfre k bhi pravesh hot he
 After this, Hanchard's life changes completely
 henchard or farfre kii mithrat pehale-pehale ghanisht hoti jati he, magar jald hi dono kii mitrataa shatruta main parivartit ho jaati he
 On this, Henchard begins to lose everything due to his anger and resentment
 vah apni shatruta ke kaaran elizbet or farfe ke rishte ko tod detaa he
 But as soon as he learns that after Susan dies, Susan is not his daughter, Newson, and his unmarried daughter had died at the same time, he then writes a letter to Farfrey to re-adopt Elizabetha to pursue her
 Who says isi dauraan luseta kii bhi zindagi poorntah badal jati he or vah bhi castorbridj main nayaa ghar kharid leti he
 Now Lucetta becomes very rich and wants to marry Henchard
 suzan ke vaapis aa jane ke vajah se henchard luseta ko thukra detaa he, parantu suzan bhi henchard se vivaah karne ke pashchaat zyaada din jivit nahin rahati
 After his death, Henchard Vipis goes to Lucetta, by which time Lucetta had fallen in love with Farfe
 jahaan henchard ek taraf apana sab kuch gavaan rahaa tha, vahiin farfre safalataa ki udan bhar rahaa tha
 Thus, Henched loses all his wounds and remains alone at the end of the story
 vah ek-ek kar apane sabase kareebi vyaktiyon ko khone ke dar main vyakul hokar un sabko khud se dur kar detaa he
 In this way, he remains alone in his good times due to his ego and his fear in bad times
 yahan tak ki uske mrityu ke samay bhi uske paas koi apana nahin hota
 Henchard is physically strong
 yadhyapi vah zyaada shikshit nahin he, tathaapi vah padh saktaa he
 The specialty of its character is its ego, charge, quick-wittedness and over-behavior, which is helpful in taking it to its end
 farfre asal main scotland se he or henchard ke baad yahi meyar banataa he
 This is unlike Henchard in every way
 shaareerik avasthaa se lekar shiksha tak henchard or farfre main koi samanta nahin he
 His approach is very scientific
 henchard ko uski har baat bahut acchhee lagati he or isi vajah se un dono kii dosti itani gahari hoti he or baad main isi vajah se unki mitrataa shatruta main badal jaati he
 Susan had to suffer a lot earlier due to being too naive, but in the second part of the story we see Susan as a completely different person
