 This method is less controversial
 Active yuthenesia Providing opium or some other medicines so that the patient gets relief but later dies
 This method is also considered valid in some countries of the world

 Terry Schiavo's death - discussion on euthanasia in the world america mahila terry shiyaavo ke maamle ne is mudde ko garma diya tha
 Terry Schiavo, 41, died last year
 florida kii is mahila ko 1990 main dil kaa daura padaa tha
 His mind remained numb until death
 terry kii jivan-mrityu ko lekar saat saal tak kanoonee ladaai chali thi
 Terry's husband wanted his wife to be free from tragic life and rest in the lap of death
 But Terry's parents wanted to keep their daughter alive

 Terry's food pipe was then removed

 • In 2005, Muhammad Yunus Ansari, a resident of Kashipur Orissa, appealed to the President that his four children are suffering from incurable disease
 unke ilaaj ke liye paisa nahin he
 So they should be allowed mercy death
 But the appeal was rejected
 kya kahata he bhartiya kaanoon In India, both willful death and mercy death are illegal acts because the attempted death, which will take place only after the execution of the will, is a crime of suicide under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code
 isi prakaar dayaa mrityu, jo bhale hi maanviya bhaavana se prerit ho evam peedit vyakti kii asahneeya pidaa ko kam karne ke liye kii janaa ho, vah bhi bhartiya dand vidhaan kii dhara 304 ke antargat sadosh hatya kaa aparaadh mana jaataa he

 That is, if we have the right to live, then we should also have the right to die
 lekin 1996 main ucchtam nyaayalay ne gyanacor banaam punjab rajya ke maamle main ukt nirnay ko ulat diya or saafe kiya ki anuchhed 21 ke antargat 'jivan ke adhikaar' main mrityuvaran kaa adhikaar shaamil nahin he
 Therefore, Sections 306 and 309 are constitutional and valid
 yuthenesia ke paksh main tark Euthanasia is a popular topic in the world today
 yah mrityu ke adhikaar par kendrit he
 Proponents of euthanasia are in favor of giving the right to death to such a person who is suffering from painful incurable diseases or is nominally alive, arguing for this 'honorable death'
 bhartiya vidhi ayog ne pichley saal sansad ko saunpi gai apni report main dayaa mrityu ko kanoonee jama pehanaane kii sifaarish kii he
 However, the Commission has admitted that there is scope for long debate on this and there is no possibility of approving it in the near future

 Andrew Macdonald patanjali ke ashtaang yoga ke sandarbh main pratyaahaar kaa alag arth he
 Here pratyahara is given in the context of Paninian grammar
 pratyaahaar kaa arth hota he – 'sankshipt kathan'
 In grammar, pratyahar is a method of assimilating various alphabets as a summary
 jaise, 'an' se a i u or 'ach' se samgr swar varna— a, i, u, ri, lri, o or ou, ityadi
 Panini has instructed the method of making pratyahara by the 'adirantyen Saheta' sutra, the 71st formula of the first foot of the first chapter of Ashtadhyayi
 adirantyen saheta : aadi varna antim it varna ke saath milakar pratyaahaar banaata he jo aadi varna evam itsanjyak antim varna ke purv aae hue varnon kaa samshti rup main bodh karaata he
 Example: Good = first pratyahar The addition of the initial letter 'A' of the formula 'aiun' with the last letter 'A' of the fourth sutra 'aiu' becomes good pratyahar
 yah ach pratyaahaar apane aadi akshar ‘a’ se lekar itsanjyak ch ke purv aane vaale ou paryant sabhi aksharon kaa bodh karaata he
 Hence, Ach = ae u ॠ ॡ a a o au
 isi tarah hal pratyaahaar kii siddhi 5wein sutara haywarat ke aadi akshar ‘ha’ ko antim 14wein sutara hal ke antim akshar l ke saath milaane se hoti he
 As a result, uparyukt sabhi 14 sutron main antim varna kii it sangya panini ne kii he
 There is a term in the form of metal
 it sanjyak varnon kaa kaary anubandh banaakar ant me nikal janaa he
 Therefore, being a noun, these last letters are used only for contracting to make pratyahar, but they are not counted in the grammatical process, meaning they are not used
 kin varnon kii it sangya hoti he, iskaa nirdesh panini ne nimnlikhit sutron dwaara kiya he: 1
 Preaching Jnunasik: In this sermon there are resonant good
 , dhatupath, ganpaath, unadipth, pratyay, aagam, aadesh ityadi dhatusutraganonadi vakyalinganushasanam
 Orders Agamsha Preaching: Evangelist 4) Resonant - Mukhnasikavchanoanunasik:
 arthath jin varnon kaa uccharan mukh evam nasika dono kii sahaayta se kiya jaae
 In Ashtadhyayi, the letters of which Panini has directed the resonance are considered resonant
 )2
 halantyam : upadesh me antim hal = vyanjan varna it hote hai
 But in divinity, the final favor, acceptance and merriment are not omitted - neither is divinity it sangya kaa vidhaan karne vaale anya sutara hai: 3
 adiritudvah 4
 shah pratyaysy 5
 lashakvataddhite 6
 chutu Due to being a noun, these letters are omitted - Tasya lopah
 lop kaa arth he – adarshan – adarshanan lopah
 As a result, the characters with this noun are not visible even when they exist
 atah, inaki gananaa bhi nahi kii jaati he
 Whenever Panini needs a particular set of alphabets, they use appropriate pratyahara instead of saying all the letters separately, which include those letters
 udhaaharan: panini ek vishisht sangya ‘gun’ kii paribhaasha dete hai: Adana guna means that the adana is called guna
 yahan, aden = at + ein 
 In this example, a is a withdrawal
 maheshwar sutara – eon ke aadyakshar ‘e’ evam antim akshar ke anubandh se yah pratyaahaar bana he
 a = a is the noun of the last letter of O
 it sangya hone se uskaa lop ho jaataa he 
 Consequently, a = A, O
 atah, a, e tathaa o ko gun kehete hai
 Example: Eco-class: If it is good, it is y instead of I
 ach = a, i, u, ri, , e, o, i, ou
 Eq = I, U, ॠ, ॡ
 yan = ya, va, r, l
 If Panini did not use the above pratyahars, he would have to say: If A, I, U, ॠ, ॡ, A, O, A, A, O, A, O, A, o after A, I, U, ॠ, इ, I, U, ॠ and ॡ
 Instead of Y, V, R, L, respectively
 is kathan ko panini ne atyant sankshipt rup me maatr ‘iko yanchi’ in do padon se vyakt kar diya he
 The Environment Act 1986 is a comprehensive legislation designed to coordinate the activities of various central and state authorities of the Central Government, established under previous laws such as the Water Act 1974 and the Air Act, 1981

 1
 Swinging poles, ropes and pegs, which were just developed in 1,900 AD, when wire ropes and steel chains became available
 2

 There was also a special difference in these recently, when steel and reinforced concrete were used
 3
 gol daat - kisi diwaar main banaaya hua chhed, yaa chattan athwa kathor mitti main kaata hua rasta
 It is found in caves
 4
 gadhi daat - funni ke aakaar ke pattharon se banaai hui hoti he
 Its strength depends on its ability to hold horizontally
 5
 toda yaa cornis - pathar yaa lakdi kaa yah niklaa hua bhaag simit hi hota tha
 Now this can be greatly increased by applying steel, reinforced concrete and scissors
 6
 tode nikaalkar shikhar banane se keval urdhwadhar daab padati he, kshaitij thel bilkul nahin padataa
 Such were the peaks of Hindu temples
 7
 tode nikaalte hue gol chhallon se gumbad banane se bhi keval urdhwadhar daab padati he
 This method was prevalent in West Asia and became the basis of the Muslim-style doctrine
 8
 isi prakaar lakadiyon ke dhaanche par, yaa uske bina hi mitti yaa kancreet ke chhallon dwaara bhi, gumbad banaae ja sakate hai; athwa saanche ko chamade yaa sarapat se dhakkar upar se mitti chadhaai ja sakati he
 These methods were often used in domestic structure

 jahaan vent miltaa tha, vahaan is prakaar kaa dhaanchaa viksit hua, is akruti kaa anusaran bharat main or anyatra bhi pathar main kiya gaya or todevaale gumbad bane
 Hunters and fishermen would have taken refuge in mountain caves in the past

 apane pashuon ke saath ghoomanevaale charvaahe chamade ke kholon main rahete rahe honge or unhen baanson yaa latthon se unchaa karke dere banaate rahe honge
 The seeds of later architectural development are found in these caves and deras

 The huts were built to suit the clumps, whose walls were made of interlocked carriage branches and the roof was made of grass

 Leather tents also employ the Baddu and other nomadic castes of Arabia

 Ancient American and Islamic architecture are also independent styles, although Islamic architecture had an indelible influence up to Spain
 misr or pashchimi asia kaa prabhaav yunaan par or falat: sari paashchaatya shaileyon par padaa, isliye ve paashchaatya vaastu ke antargat hi aa sakate hai
 There are many things in oriental art which are not used by Europeans, so they find them unpleasant and distorted
 kintu prayog hi dhire-dhire prakruti ban jaataa he
 Therefore, there is essentially some distinction between Eastern and Western Vastu, which arises as an influence of specific religious acts and social practices in purely oriental architecture
 purv main alankaran yojanaayen hi pramukh rahi hai jabaki europe main nirmaan sambandhi samasyaon kaa dridhtaapurvak saamana karte hue unke kramik samaadhaan dwaara vaastu viksit hua
 There is some ideology at the core of each major phase of the historical development of architecture
 unani vaastu main parishkrut purnataa thi, roman imaaraten apane vaigyanik nirmaan ke liye prasiddh hai, francisi gothi vaastu ugr kriyasheeltaa kaa dyotak he, italvi punaruddhar main us yug kaa paanditya jhalkata he or bhartiya vaastu kaa pramukh gun he uskaa aadhyatmik vishay
 There is no doubt that expressing the religious consciousness of the people in tangible form has been the basic objective of Indian architecture, that is, public sentiment is embodied in brick and stone
 bhartiya vaastu kii visheshta yahan kii deevaaron ke utkrisht or prachur alankaran main he
 The scheme of frescoes and sculptures, which in addition to ornamentation, expresses a serious sense of its subject, sometimes completely envelops the building from the outside
 inamen vaastu kaa jivan se sambandh kya, vastav main aadhyatmik jivan hi ankit he
 The gods and goddesses across the country, engraved in their supernatural acts engraved in the novel elevation, and the age-old mythological gems, symbolize the sculpture, opening a book of highly interesting stories and delightful paintings in front of the audience
 vaastukala par musalamaanon ke akraman kaa jitna prabhaav bharat main padaa utana anyatra kahin nahin, kyonki jis sabhyataa se muslim sabhyataa kii takkar hui, kisi se uskaa itnaa virodh nahin tha jitna bhartiya sabhyataa se
 Compared to the prestigious Indian social and religious trends, Muslim civilization was completely new, its fundamental principles were also different
 donon kaa sangharsh yatharthwaad kaa adarshavaad se, vaastaviktaa kaa swapndarshita se or vyakt kaa avyakt se sangharsh tha, jiskaa pramaan masjid or mandir ke bhed main spasht he
 The mosques are open, their center is in the direction of distant Mecca; While the temple is a house of mystery, the center of which is the middle devasthan or sanctum sanctorum surrounded by many walls and corridors
 majisd kii deevaaren praaia: saadi yaa pavitra aayaton se utkeern hoti hai, unamem maanav akritiyon kaa chithran nishiddh hota he; jabaki mandiron kii deevaaron main murtikla or maanavkruti chithran ucchtam shikhar par pahunchaa, par likhaai kaa naam na tha
 This depiction of the simple colors of the stones brought alive to the temples; Whereas the walls were articulated in the mosques by colorful stones, marble and painting plastered plaster
 dekhen - ankorwat mandir Outstanding specimens of Indian art are also found outside India in Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, Syam, Java, Bali, Hindchina and Cambodia
 nepal ke shambhunath, bodhanath, mamnath mandir, lanka main anuradhapur kaa stupa or lankatilak mandir, barma ke buddha math or pagoda, cambodia main ankor ke mandir, syam main bainkak ke mandir, java main pranbanaam kaa bihar, kalasana mandir or borobandar stupa aadi hindu or buddha vaastu ke vyapak prasar ke pramaan hai
 Some evidence of the entry of Indian culture into Java is found in the 4th century AD

 The Maurya dynasty was a powerful and great dynasty of ancient India, the Kamboja dynasty
 isane 137 varsh bharat main rajya kiya
 Its establishment is credited to Chandragupta Maurya and his minister Kautilya, who defeated Emperor Ghanananda of the Nanda dynasty, who was the brother of Chandragupta Maurya
 maury samrajya ke vistaar evam use shaktishaalee banane kaa shrey samraat ashok ko jaataa he
 This empire started in the Magadha kingdom in the east from the plains of the river Ganges
 isaki rajdhani patliputra thi
 Chandragupta Maurya founded this empire in 322 BC and rapidly developed his empire towards the west
 usne kai chote chote kshetreey rajyon ke aapasi matbhedon kaa phayda uthaaya jo sikandar ke akraman ke baad paidaa ho gayi the
 By 316 BCE, the Maurya dynasty had captured the whole of North Western India
 chakravarti samraat ashok ke rajya main maury vansh kaa behad vistaar hua
 It was due to Emperor Ashoka that the Maurya Empire became the most famous and powerful worldwide
 325 isapurv main uttar pashchimi bharat sikandar ke kshatrapon kaa shashan tha
 When Alexander was invading Punjab, a Brahmin named Chanakya came to encourage Magadha for empire expansion
 us samay magadh acha khaasaa shaktishaalee tha tathaa uske padosi rajyon kii ankhon kaa kaanta
 But the then Emperor Ghananand of Magadha turned him down
 usne kaha ki tum ek pandit ho or apni chotii kaa hi dhyaan rakho "yuddh karnaa raja kaa kaam he tum pandit ho sirf panditai karo" tabhi se chanakya ne pratigya liya kii dhananand ko sabak sikhaa ke rahegaa| The Mauryas have been part of the ancient Kshatriya clan

 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture
 
 Chandragupta was the son of the same Gana chief who was killed as a warrior in his childhood
 chandragupta main raja banane ke swaabhaavik gun the 'isi yogyata ko dekhte hue chanakya ne use apana shishy bana liya, evam ek sabal raashtra kii niv daali jo kii aaj tak ek adarsh he
 This was followed by a web of spies spread across India to collect secret information against the king as traitors - this was perhaps unprecedented in India
 ek baar aisa ho jane ke baad usne chandragupta ko unani kshatrapon ko maar bhagane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives
 magadh ke akraman main chanakya ne magadh main grihayuddh ko uksaaya
 His detectives bribed Nanda's officers and made him in his favor
 iske baad nand shaasha ne apana pad chhod diya or chanakya ko vijayshri praapt hui
 Nanda had to lead an exile life after which what happened to him is unknown
 chandragupta maury ne janata kaa vishwaas bhi jeeta or iske saath usko satta kaa adhikaar bhi mila
 At that time, Magadha was the most powerful state in India
 magadh par kabja hone ke baad chandragupta satta ke kendra par kaabiz ho chukaa tha
 Chandragupta started his conquest of western and southern India
 isaki jaankaree apratyaksh saakshyon se milti he
 The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman states that a dam on the Sudarshan Lake was built by Pushyagupta for irrigation
 pushyagupt us samay ashok kaa prantiy rajyapal tha
 After liberating northwest India from Greek rule, its focus shifted to the south
 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter
 celukas ne megasthaneez ko chandragupta ke darbar main rajdoot ke rup main bheja tha
 According to Plutarch, "sandrocottus had ascended the throne by that time, he had trampled and subjugated the whole of India with his army of 6,00,000 soldiers"
 yah tippanee thodi atishyokti kahi ja sakati he kyonki itnaa gyaat he ki kaveri nadi or uske dakshin ke kshetron main us samay cholon, pandyon, satyaputron tathaa keralaputron kaa shashan tha

 uske shilalikhit dharmopadesh pratham tathaa trayodash main unke padosi chol, pandya tathaa anya rajyon kaa varnan miltaa he
 Since there is no information that Ashoka or his father Bindusar had fought any war in the south and conquered it, it is believed that Chandragupta had conquered them
 apane jivan ke uttarardh main usne jain dharm apana liya tha or singhaasana tyagkar karnataka ke shravanbelagola main apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath sanyasi jivan vyateet karne laga tha
 After Chandragupta his son Bindusara was ruling but not much is known about him
 dakshin kii ore samrajya vistaar kaa shrey yada kada bindusaar ko diya jaataa he hanlanki uske vijay abhiyaan kaa koi sakshya nahin he
 According to the Jain tradition, his mother's name was Durdhar and Bindusara ruled in the Puranas for 25 years
 use amitraghaat kii oopaadhi bhi di jaati he jise unani granthon main amitrochatus kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Bindusar Azivak believed in Dharam
 usne ek unani shaasha en tiocus pratham se sukhi anjir, mithi sharaab va ek darshanik kii maang kii thi
 Emperor Ashoka is one of the greatest rulers not only of India but of the history of the world

 Although he has been a very powerful and great emperor than Akbar

 During the days of his prince, he suppressed the rebellions of Ujjain and Taxila

 He embraced Buddhism and did many things to propagate it

 He held the title of Devanapriya, Priyadarshi
 samraat ashok ke shilaalekh tathaa shilotkeern upadesh bhartiya upmahadweep main jagah-jagah paae gaye hai
 He also sent his preachers abroad to preach Dhamma

 He sent his son Mahendra from the capital Pataliputra through the Sri Lanka waterway
 patna kaa aitihaasik mahendru ghat usee ke naam par namakrit he
 Emperor Ashoka maintained a large army even after the war broke out
 aisa videshi akraman se samrajya ke patan ko rokane ke liye aavashyak tha
 The capital of the Maurya Empire was Pataliputra
 iske atirikt samrajya ko prashasan ke liye chaar or praanton main baanta gaya tha
 Tausali was the capital of the eastern part and Suvarnagiri of the southern part
 isi prakaar uttari tathaa pashchimi bhaag kii rajdhani kramshah takshashila tathaa ujjain thi
 Apart from this, Samapa, Ishila and Kaushambi were also important cities

 Each district was divided into village groups

 Kautilya has written an entire chapter in economics about the administration of cities
 vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki us samay patliputra tathaa anya nagaron kaa prashasan is sinddhant ke anuroop hi rahaa hoga
 Megasthenes describes the administration of Pataliputra
 uske anusaar patliputra nagar kaa shashan ek nagar parishad dwaara kiya jaataa tha jisamen 30 sadsy the
 These thirty members were divided into six committees with five members each
 prayek samiti kaa kuch nishchit kaam hota tha
 The work of the first committee was related to industrial and artistic production
 iskaa kaam vetan nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa milawat rokna bhi tha
 The second committee looked into the affairs of people coming from outside in Pataliputra, especially foreigners
 teesri samiti kaa taalluk janm tathaa mrityu ke panjikaran se tha
 The fourth committee regulated trade and commerce
 iskaa kaam nirmit maal kii bikri tathaa panya par nazar rakhana tha
 The fifth was to keep an eye on the manufacture of goods, and the sixth work was to be done
 nagar parishad ke dwaara janakalyaan ke kaary karne ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke adhikari bhi niyukt kiye jate the, jaise - sadakon, bazaaron, chikitsaalayon, devalayon, shiksha-sansthaaon, jalaapurti, bandargahon kii marammat tathaa rakrakhaav kaa kaam karnaa
 The principal officer of the city was called Nagark
 kautilya ne nagar prashasan main kai vibhaagon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he jo nagar ke kai kaaryakalapon ko niyamit karte the, jaise - lekha vibhaag, rajasav vibhaag, khan tathaa khanij vibhaag, rath vibhaag, seemaa shulk or kar vibhaag
 Another thing which was unprecedented in India during the Maurya Empire was the Mauryo's intelligence trap
 us samay puure rajya main guptcharon kaa jaal bicha diya gaya tha jo rajya par kisi bahari akraman yaa aantarik vidroh kii khabar prashasan tathaa sena tak pahunchaate the
 National political unity was established in India only during the reign of Maurya dynasty
 maury prashasan main satta kaa sudrudh kendriyakaran tha parantu raja nirankush nahin hota tha
 During the Mauryan period, the Republic declined and the political system was strengthened
 kautilya ne rajya sapthank siddhanth nirdisht kiya tha, jinke aadhaar par maury prashasan or uski grih tathaa videsh niti sanchalit hoti thi - raja, amaatya janapad, durg, kosh, sena or, mitra
 One result of the establishment of such a large empire was that there was economic integration throughout the empire
 kisaanon ko sthaneey rup se koi kar nahin dena padataa tha, hanlanki iske badale unhen kadai se par vaazib maatra main kar kendriya adhikariyon ko dena padataa tha
 The currency of that time was gage

 By the time of the Mauryas, Buddhist and Jain communities had developed

 Chandragupta Maurya had renounced his throne and converted to Jainism
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki chandragupta ne apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath karnataka ke shravanbelagola main sanyasi ke rup main rahane laga tha
 In later inscriptions, it is found that Chandragupta died at the same place by fasting fast as a true devoted Jain
 vahaan paas main hi chandragiri naam kii pahari he jiskaa namaakaran shaayad chandragupta ke naam par hi kiya gaya tha
 Ashoka adopted Buddhism after the Kalinga war
 iske baad usne dhamm ke prachaar main apana dhyaan lagaaya
 Here Dhamma meant "moral principles", not religion or religion or religion
 us samay na to islam kaa janm hua tha or na hi isiyat kaa
 Therefore, those moral principles were not to oppose any religion outside, but to provide a moral law to man
 apane duusare shilaalekh main usne likhaa he - " dhamm kya he? alp dushkarm tathaa adhik satkarm
 Avoiding evils like fury, cruelty, anger, pride and jealousy, and observance of virtues such as mercy, generosity, truth, self-control, simplicity, attachment to morality, purity of heart, and internal and external purity
 " After adopting Buddhism, he also tried to bring it into life
 usne shikaar karnaa or pashuon kii hatya chhod diya tathaa manushyon tathaa jaanwaron ke liye chikitsaalayon kii sthapana karai

 He appointed officers of the rank of Dharmamahatra whose work was to propagate Dhamma to the general public

 chandragupta maury ne shashan sanchaalan ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye chaar praanton main vibhajit kar diya tha jinhen chakra kaha jaataa tha

 For many years after the non-cooperation movement ended, Mahatma Gandhi kept himself focused on social reforms
 1928 main unhone pun:raajnneeti main pravesh karne kii sochi
 In that year, an all-india campaign was being carried out against the Simon Commission, which was sent from England to investigate the conditions of the colonies, with all white members
 gandhi ji ne swayan is andolan main bhaag nahin liya tha par unhone is andolan ko apana aashirwad diya tha tathaa isi varsh bardoli main hone vaale ek kisaan satyagrah ke saath bhi unhone aisa kiya tha
 In the end of December 1929, the Congress held its annual session in the city of Lahore
 yah adhiveshan do drushtiyon se mahatvapurn tha : jawaharlal nehru kaa adhyaksh ke rup main chunaav jo yuva peedi ko netritv kii chadi saunpane kaa pratik tha or ‘purna swaraj’ athwa purna swatantraaa kii udghoshnaa
 Now the pace of politics had increased once again
 26 JAN 1930 ko vibhinn sthanon par rashtriya dhvaj faharaakar or deshbhakti ke geet gaakar ‘swatantraaa diwas’ manaaya gaya
 Gandhiji himself gave clear instructions as to how this day should be celebrated
 unhone kaha ki yadi ;swatantraaa kii udghoshnaa sabhi gaanvon or sabhi shaharon yahan tak ki— acha hoga
 It would be nice if all the places have seminars at the same time
 gandhi ji ne suzav diya ki nagaade petakar paaramparik tirake se sangoshtee ke samay kii ghoshnaa kii jaae
 The celebrations will begin with the hoisting of the national flag

 Those participating in it will take a firm pledge that the Indian people, like others, have the inalienable right to enjoy the freedom and fruits of their hard work and that if any government deprives the people of these rights or suppresses them If it does, then people also have the right to change or eliminate it
 ‘swatantraaa diwas’ manaae jane ke turant baad mahatma gandhi ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve british bharat ke sarvaadhik ghrunit kanoonon main se ek, jisane namak ke utpaadan or vikray par rajya ko ekadhikaar de diya he, ko todane ke liye ek yatra kaa netritv karenge
 The issue of salt monopoly which he had selected was another example of Gandhi's skillful prudence
 prayek bhartiya ghar main namak kaa prayog aprihaary tha lekin iske baavjood unhen gharelu prayog ke liye bhi namak banane se roka gaya or is tarah unhen dukaanon se unche daam par namak kharidne ke liye baadhya kiya gaya
 State's monopoly on salt was quite unpopular
 isi ko nishaanaa banaate hue gandhi ji angreji shashan ke khilaaf vyapak asantosh ko sangathitakarne kii soch rahe the
 Most of the Indians understood the importance of this challenge of Gandhiji but not the British Raj
 haalaanki gandhi ji ne apni ‘namak yatra’ kii purv soochna visarai lard ervin ko de di thi kintu ervin unki is kaarywahi ke mahatv ko na samaj sake
 On 12 March 1930, Gandhiji started walking towards the sea from his ashram in Sabarmati
 teen hafton baad ve apane gantavy sthaan par pahunche
 There he made himself a criminal in the eyes of the law by making a handful of salt
 isi bich desh ke anya bhaagon main samaantar namak yatraayen ayojit kii gai
 Apart from the officially sanctioned national campaign like the Non-cooperation movement, there were numerous streams of protest
 desh ke vishaal bhaag main kisaanon ne damankaaree aupniveshik van kanoonon kaa ulanghan kiya jiske kaaran ve or unke maveshi unheen jangalon main nahin ja sakate the jahaan ek jamaane main ve berokatoke ghoomte the
 In some towns, factory workers went on strike, lawyers boycotted British courts and students refused to study in government educational institutions
 1920-22 kii tarah is baar bhi gandhi ji ke aahvaan ne tamaam bhartiya virgon ko aupniveshik shashan ke viruddh apana asantosh vyakt karne ke liye prerit kiya
 In response, the government started arresting dissidents
 namak satyagrah ke silsile main lagbhag 60,000 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Gandhiji was also among those who were arrested
 samudr tat kii ore gandhi ji kii yatra kii pragati kaa pataa unki gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ke liye tainaat police afasaron dwaara bheji gai gopneey repot se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In these reports, Gandhiji's speeches are also given in the villages of the road in which he called upon the local authorities to leave government jobs and join the freedom struggle
 vasana naamak gaanv main gandhi ji ne unchi jati waalon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki yadi aap swaraj ke haq main aawaaj uthaate hai to aapako achhuton kii seva kerani padegi
 You will not get swaraj only by the abolition of salt tax or other taxes
 swaraj ke liye aapako apni un galtiyon kaa praayshchit karnaa hoga jo aapane achhuton ke saath kii hai
 For Swaraj, all Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Sikhs will have to unite
 ye swaraj kii seedhiyaan hai
 The detectives of Fappulis had written in their report that women and men of all castes are attending Gandhiji's meetings
 unka kahana tha ki hajaaron walantier rashtravaadi uddeshy ke liye saamne aa rahe hai
 Many of them were government officials who resigned their posts in colonial rule
 sarkaar ko bheji apni report main jila police suparintendent ;police adheekshak ne likhaa tha ki fshri gandhi shant or nishcint dikhaai die
 As they are advancing, their strength is increasing
 namak yatra kii pragati ko ek or baat se bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 American news magazine Time used to laugh at Gandhiji's stature
 patrika ne unke takue jaise shariray or makadi jaise pairo kaa khub majaak udaaya tha

 These are called fixed points
 in avasthaaon main padaarth ke kisi vishesh gun ke pariman nikaal lete hai or unke antar ko ek nishchit sankhya main baraabar baraabar baant dete hai
 Each of these degrees is considered a unit of temperature, which is called a degree or degree
 bahut samay se tapamapiyon main himbindu or bhapavindu kaa niyat binduon ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The temperature at which pure ice and pure air-saturated water coexist at the pressure of one atmosphere is called a snow point
 isi prakaar nishchit daab par shuddh pani or shuddh bhaap kaa samya bhapabindu batalaata he
 In normal thermometers, there is a small hollow hole in the glass, filled with mercury or liquid
 tapiya prasaran ke kaaran drav nalee main chadh jaataa he
 Marks are placed in front of the bottom of the fluid at both fixed points
 centegrade paimaane main, jisko ab selsius paimaana kehete hai, himbindu ko shunya or bhapabindu ko 100 degree maanate hai
 The distance between these two signs is divided into 100 even parts
 fahrenheit maapehit mapkram main ye donon bindu kramash: 32 or 212 degree maane jate hai or inkaa antar 180 bhaagon main vibhakt hota he
 In the above thermometers, the temperature is based on thermal transmission, but not necessarily so
 koi bhi gun, jo tapavriddhi ke anusaar ekadishtataa se badhata he, is kaary ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he
 In fact, many sensitized thermometers in the laboratory are based on electronegative changes or thermodynamics
 gunon kii tarah drav padaartho par bhi koi pratibandh nahin hota
 Any substance can be used in a thermometer, but the main problem is that different thermometers can be created by the difference of substances and properties, except for the two fixed points, there will be differences in readings at all other temperatures
 isse siddh he ki yah sab mulat: pramanik nahin maane ja sakate
 In principle, thermodynamics based on thermodynamics are considered automatic proofs and other scales are purified accordingly
 is vigyaan main aise ingine kii kalpana kii gai he jo ek bhatthi se ooshmaa lekar uskaa kuch ansh mahattam dakshata ke saath kaary main parivartit kar detaa he or shesh bhaag ek nimnatapiya sanghnitr ko de detaa he
 This is called the Carno engine, or reversible engine
 siddhant ke anusaar agar bhatthi or sanghnitr ke bahut se bhinn tapiya jode ekatrit hon or ek carno ingine prayek ke bich kramash: lagaaya jaae, to uske dwaara kiya gaya kaary in jodo ke tapatar bhed ke samaanupati hota he
 Thus the temperature can be determined by measuring the work
 is ingine kii dakshata uske silinder main bhare hue dravya or uski avasthaa par nirbhar nahin karti, isliye isko taapmaana kaa aadhaar mana gaya he or iske dwaara nirdhaarit taap ko paramtaap kehete hai
 Like the centigrade and Fahrenheit scales, the permittivity scale is not arbitrarily zero
 carno ingine dwaara kiya gaya kaary bhatthi or sanghnitr donon ke taap par nirbhar karata he
 The thermal state of the condenser can also be such that it converts all the heat from the engine furnace to work and the condenser does not get any part of it
 aisi sthiti main sanghnitr kaa taap paramashunya mana jaataa he
 To determine the degree of degree, two fixed points are required as before
 1954 i0 se purv paramtaap paimaane main bhi him or bhaap binduon kaa prayog hota tha
 The temperature difference of these two was considered to be 100 ° ultimate
 iskaa yah arth he ki kaarne ingine kii bhatthi ko bhapabindu par or sanghnitr ko himbindu par rakhane se jo kaary miltaa he uskaa shatansh kaary ek degree pradarshit karti he
 The major difficulty in this arrangement is that the accuracy of the icepoint is limited and there is a difference of up to ± 01 ° Pa in the zodiacs obtained by different scientists
 isse bachane ke liye san 1954 se antarrashtriya nishchay ke anusaar keval ek hi niyat bindu kaa upyog hone laga he
 Trikindu is the temperature at which water, ice and water vapor are possible
 iskaa maan swechha se 273
16° paa maan liya gaya he
 It can be said that before 1954, the paramount scale was determined by three points, but now only two points are used
 duusaren shabdon main is lekh ke prarambh main varnit do niyat binduon main se ek paramashunya or doosraa trikbindu hota he
 The 1 / 273
16 fraction of the work done by the Carno engine working between Trikbindu and Paramanyu shows an absolute degree of work
 carno kaa ingine adarsh maatr he or vyavhaar main iskaa nirmaan sambhav nahin, parantu yah siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki adarsh gas ke tapiya prasaran dwaara nirmit tapamapi ke paathyank paramtaap ke baraabar hote hai
 Therefore, the ideal gas scale is considered to be an automatic proof, or primary standard
 adarsh gas us gas ko kehete hai jo nimnlikhit niyam kaa paalan karti he: In which there is pressure, volume and temperature
 niyatank he jiskaa maan prayek adarsh gas kii ek gram-anu maatra ke liye ek samaan hota he
 Gas thermometers are of two types, one with constant volume and the other with constant pressure
 pehle kii kriya saral he or uski trutiyon kaa sanshodhan vishwasaneey rup se kiya ja saktaa he
 Hence only static volume thermometers are used
 jaisaa naam ke prakat he, inase gas kaa aaytan sthir rakhkar daab kaa maapan kiya jaataa he
 It takes a lot of hard work and time to extract heat from an ideal gas thermometer
 anek kaarnon se paath main trutiyaan hona sambhav he or inke liye praapt falon main sanshodhan karnaa hota he
 Some errors are corrected by making appropriate changes in the temperature of the thermometer and long calculations have to be done for some
 isse yah siddh he ki gas tapamapi prayogshaala main dainik kaary ke liye upyukt nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, according to international determination, the melting and boiling points of some substances are used as the primary standard
 ye ank adarsh gas-paimaane se bahut parishram ke pashchaat thik rup se maap liye gaye hai or unke maan antarrashtriya sweekruti paa chuke hai

 Heat distortions above 1063 ° are measured by thermometers
 jis prakaar tapavriddhi se padaarthon kii lambaai badhati he usee prakaar dhaatu ke taron ke vidyutpratirodh main bhi taap dwaara vruddhi hoti he
 Like thermal propagation, this increase can also be used in temperature
 is kaary ke liye anek dhaatuon ke taron kaa upyog hota he
 Nevertheless, a thermometer made of platinum wire is more important because it is used for interpolation of international scale
 taar shuddh ghaatu kaa or vikrutimukt hona aavashyak he
 Wrap the wire in a thin mica, or crystal frame, in the bulb and measure its resistance by calculating the heat by the appropriate equation as needed
 pratiroshmapan ke liye kai prakaar ke vidyutsetuon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Among them, the calendar-griffith's bridge is old and well known
 yah wheatstone sethu ke siddhanthapar aadhaarit he
 The carrier wires that are connected to the platinum wire of resistance are also heated by heat, which also changes their resistance
 yah parivartan bhi sethu dvaaramaapit hokar taap kii gananaa main ashuddhi kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 To remove this error from the calendar Griffith bridge, exactly the same type of carrier wire is also placed in the conjugate arm of the bridge
 donon jode tapamapi main paas paas rahete hai or inpar ooshmaa kaa ek sa prabhaav padataa he
 For this reason, they have no effect on the balance and measured resistance of the bridge
 is truti ko dur karne kaa anya upaay yah he ki platinum ke taar kaa pratirodh na nikaal kar uske siron ke bich vibhavantar napate hai
 a certain amount of electric current is carried inside the wire
 iske do siron ko ek vibhavamaapi se jodakar vibhavatanr maap lete hai
 Since the resistance is proportional to the resistance, the resistance is calculated according to the rules of ohms
 inamen vaahak taron ke pratirodh kaa prabhaav purnataya lupt ho jaataa he
 If the wires of two different metals are combined in a circuit and their confluents are placed at different temperatures, then electric current flows in the circuit
 yah dhara paripath main sugrahi dharamapi dwaara dekhi ja sakati he
 The value of the generating force of the current, that is, the electric force, depends on the temperature of a and b
 at: isko naapakar tapantar gyaat kar sakate hai
 The joints of such wire are called heat pair
 antarashtriya paimaane main prayukt tapantar yugmon kii dhaatuon kaa varnan upar kiya gaya he, kintu prayogshaala main sugrahita or prayog kii aavashyaktaaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar vibhinn dhaatuen kaam main laai jaati hai
 The temperature in the heat pair is dependent on the temperature, so the temperature at the confluence of the lower temperature is kept constant
 k or kha siron ko vibhavamaapi athwa milivoltmapi se sanyukt karke EMF maap liya jaataa he
 It is directly measured in millivoltmeters, but it is not as sensitive as a voltmeter
 jab kisi thos vastu ko garam kiya jaataa he to usase urja kaa vidyucchumbakeey tarangon ke rup main vikiran hota he
 The wavelength of the waves is low when they are low in temperature and they feel heat
 adhik tapavriddhi hone par chote tarangadairdhyavaali tarangon kaa aadhiky ho jaataa he, jinase prakaash kii pratiti hoti he
 The amount of radiated energy and its properties also depend on the state of the hot object
 purnataya kaali vastu main yah gun hota he ki vah apane upar padanevaali samast vikeern urja kaa shoshan kar leti he or swat: adhiktam urja kaa vikiran karti he
 Such an object is also known as Krishna object or Krishnaka
 yadi chaaron ore se band khokhale pind kii deevaaron ko samtap par rakhaa jaae to uske bheetar utpann vikeern urja gun or maatra main purnataya krishnika vikiran ke samaan hoti he
 Therefore, in the laboratory, we use such a hollow pot for a black body
 yah avashya karte hai ki usamen ek chota chhidr bana dete hai, jisase bheetar se urja baahar aa sake or uske gunon kaa adhyayan sambhav ho
 For the highest temperature use a black body
 isapar aadhaarit tapamapi do prakaar ke hote hai
 The amount of complete radiation is measured in one
 isko purna vikiran uttapamapi kehete hai
 The second type studies the properties of radiation
 inako prakaashiya uttapamapi kehete hai
 These thermometers have the property that they do not require the thermometer to be attached to a hot material and can measure high temperature
 par inamen dosha yah he ki siddhantat: inase keval krishnika kaa tapamaapan sambhav he
 The temperature of other items will be less than the actual temperature, which requires modification
 yah stephen ke niyam par aadhaarit he
 According to this law, the energy radiated by a black body is proportional to the fourth degree of absolute heat, that is, ek sthiraank he
 For temperature measurement, the radiation of a thermodynamic object focuses on one end of a heating pair from a lens or mirror, causing energy to be extinguished
 agar sthiraank maaloom ho to uparokt sameekaran dwaara taap kii gananaa ho sakati he
 In fact, the power of heat is slightly different from 4 due to many errors
 isliye vyavhaar main neeche die gaye sameekaran kaa prayog karte hai: It has more constants
 b stephen ke niyamanusaar 4 hona chahie, kintu yahan isko agyaat maan lete hai
 The heat and temperature of a thermodynamic black body is the temperature of the pair
 uttapamapak ko nishchit tapon kii krishnikaon ke samaksh rakhkar a or b kaa maan nikaal liya jaataa he
 There is such a arrangement of radiation focalization in the device that the heat measured from it does not depend on the distance of the heat object
 yadi vastu purnataya krishna na ho to is ashuddhi ke liye sanshodhan kar liya jaataa he
 In these, the microscopic fraction of the spectrum of radiation received from the black body, which has a wavelength of about one, is sorted and its intensity is compared to the radiation intensity of a standard lamp
 yadi tarangadairghy ke liye paramtaap par krishnika kii vikiran tivrata par uski tivrata ho, to plank ke niyamanusaar Is a constant whose value is determined by Planck's theory
 yadi E1, E2 or T1 gyaat hon, to T2 gyaat ho jaataa he
 The invisible fibers change the radiation intensity of the standard light in the atomometer in such a way that its intensity becomes equal to the intensity of the radiated energy measured
 us samay batti kaa tantu adrishy ho jaataa he
 In another type of optical thermometer, the intensity of standard radiation is kept constant and enters the thermometer, including radiation of objects of unknown heat
 daanon ko lambavat talon main rekhadhruvit kar diya jaataa he
 It is arranged that the image of each radiation should be semi-spherical and adjacent to each other

 Find the temperature from the above formula by finding E1 / E2 from the rotating angle of nickel
 antarrashtriya paimaane ke sambandh main 'nimna taap' kaa 1900 sein0 tak maapan varnit he
 This leads to the use of volatile thermometers for lower temperatures
 drav kii vashpadaab uske taap par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, the gases transform into liquid form and fill them in steam volatiles
 daab kii maatra se turant taap gyaat ho jaataa he
 For this, oxygen, nitrogen and helium are used in liquid form
 helium vashpadabeey tapamapiyon se lagbhag 10 tak taap maapit ho saktaa he
 This causes magnetic thermometers to be used for low temperatures

 The most prominent error in these is that the zero symbol varies
 yah do karno se hota he
 When a thermometer is made, its glass keeps shrinking for a long time after that, due to which the zero sign keeps changing
 duusare, jab bhi kisi garam vastu kaa taap napate he, tab shishe ko apni saamaanya avasthaa main aane main bahut samay lagata hai
 The thermometer or thermometer can be classified into two distinct groups according to the level of information on the underlying thermodynamic rules and the physical basis of the quantities
 praathmik tapamapi ke liye, padaarth kii maapit visheshta itani bhalee prakaar gyaat hoti he ki taapmaana ko bina kisi agyaat pariman ke pariklit kiya ja saktaa he
 Examples of this are thermometers that are angular asymmetrical on the equation of a gas state, the velocity of sound in a gas, the thermal noise voltage or the flow of an electric resistor, and the gamma ray emission of some radioactive nuclei in a magnetic field
 Are based on

 tulykaalik motor yaa sincronas motor prayavarti dhara se chalane vaali vidyut motor he
 Its name is equivalent to a synchronous motor or synchronous motor because the rotational speed of its rotor is exactly the same as the rotational magnetic field speed in the stator
 is motor kaa upyog praayah kisi lod ko ghumaane main nahin kiya jaataa balki shakti gunank ko sudhaarney main kiya jaataa he
 In special situations it is also used in running loads
 sincronas chaal, Where: tulykaalik motor ke mukhya bhaag hai- stater or roter

 Vedic civilization is the civilization of ancient India in which the Vedas were composed
 bhartiya vidvan to is sabhyataa ko anadi parampara aayaa hua maanate hai | pashchimi vidwano ke anusaar aaryon kaa ek samudaay bharat me lagbhag 1500 isvi isa purv aayaa or unke aagaman ke saath hi yah sabhyataa aarambh hui thi
 Generally, most scholars consider the period of Vedic civilization from 1500 BC to 500 AD, but the remains found from new archaeological excavations have found many remains of Vedic civilization, which modern scholars like David Frawley, Telagiri, BB Lal, s r Rao, Subhash Kak, Aurobindo have started to believe that Vedic civilization started in India itself and the Rigveda was composed in the Sunga period, kyonki aaryo ke bharat me aane kaa na to koi puraatatva utkhanno se pramaan mila he or na hi di en e anusandhano se koi pramaan mila he is kaal main vartmaan hindu dharm ke swaroop kii neenv padi thi jo aaj bhi astitv main he
 Apart from Vedas, many other Sanskrit texts were also composed during this period

 There is Gayatri Mantra in the Rigveda itself which is dedicated to Savita
 rugveda ke kaal nirdhaaran main vidwaan ekamat nahin he
 Max Müller first attempted to determine the Vedas
 usne buddha dharm se peeche kii ore chalate hue vaidic sahitya ke teen granthon kii rachana ko manamaane dhang se 200-200 varshon kaa samay diya or is tarah rugveda ke rachana kaal ko 1200 isa purv ke kareeb maan liya par nishchit rup se uske aankalan kaa koi aadhaar nahin tha
 The Vedic period can be mainly divided into two parts - the Rigvedic period and the post-vedic period
 rigvaidic kaal aaryon ke aagaman ke turant baad kaa kaal tha jisamen karmkand gaun the par uttaravaidic kaal main hindu dharm main karmkaandon kii pramukhataa bad gai
 The date of this period has been as controversial as the exact information about the people of this period
 iskaa ek pramukh kaaran yah bhi he ki is samay tak keval isi granth kii rachana hui thi
 According to Max Muller, Arya's original residence is Middle Asia

 It was criticized by D
 Whitney

 It is believed that a group of Aryans went towards Iran and Europe in addition to India
 irani bhashaa ke pracheenatam granth avesta kii sukhtiyaan rugveda se milti julati hai
 If we look at this linguistic analogy, the Rigveda's creation date is 1000 BC
