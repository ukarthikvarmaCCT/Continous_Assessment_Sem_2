 Critics of ideology often treat it as a subject of faith that has no scientific basis
 tark diya jaataa he ki kisi vichaardhaara vishesh ke anuyaayi use apane aap main satya maanakar uskaa anusaran karte hai, uske satyaapan kii aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi jaati
 In fact, supporters of each ideology must offer some theory and logic to confirm it and try to instill faith and trust in the other's mind

 Inter-networking is the process of connecting a computer network to other networks using gateways that provide a common way of routing information packets between networks
 iske parinaam swaroop paraspar jude hue networkon kii pranali ko ek inter-network yaa sirf ek internet kaha jaataa he
 The most notable example of inter-networking is the Internet, a network of networks based on several underlying hardware technologies but integrated by an inter-networking protocol standard called the Internet Protocol Suite, often also known as TCP / IP
 inter-netwarking kii shuruyaat vibhinn prakaar kii netwarking takneekon ko jodne kii ek vidhi ke rup main hui thi lekin kisi prakaar ke wide aria network ke madhyam se do yaa adhik local aria networkon ko jodne kii badhati jarurat kii vajah se iskaa istemaal vyapak rup se hone laga
 inter-network ke liye mul shabd catanet tha
 The definition of inter-network today includes the interaction of other types of computer networks such as personal area networks
 internet ke purvavarti, aarapanet main alag-alag networkon ko jodne ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale network sambandhi tatwon ko multah getwe kaha jaataa tha, lekin vibhinn upkarnon ke saath kaaryaatmakataa ke sambhavit bhram kii vajah se is sandarbh main is shabd ko anuchit samajha gaya
 Today, interconnecting gateways are called Internet routers
 networkon kaa ek anya prakaar kaa interconection aksar udhyamon ke andar netwarking model ke link layer yani tisipi / ypi logical interpheson ke str ke neeche hardware kendrit str main paaya jaataa he
 Such interconnection is accomplished with network bridges and network switches
 ise kabhi-kabhi galat tareeke se inter-netwarking kah diya jaataa he, lekin iske parinaam swaroop banane vaala system sidhe taur par ek bada, ekal sabanetwork hota he or in upkarnon ke prayog ke liye internet protocol jaise kisi inter-netwarking protocol kii jarurat nahin padati he
 However, a single computer can be converted into an inter-network by dividing the network into segments and logically segmenting traffic with routers
 internet protocol ko puure network main ek gaiyr-bharosemand packet sarvice pradaan karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 Its structure ignores intermediate network related elements that maintain any state of the network
 isaki bajaay yah kaary prayek sanchaar satr ke antim binduon ko saunpa jaataa he
 To transfer data in a reliable manner, applications must use an appropriate transport layer protocol such as a transmission control protocol that provides a reliable flow
 kuch aplication un kaaryon main ek saral, sampark-rahit transport protocol, yujar datagram protocol kaa istemaal karte hai jiske liye data kii vishwasaneey supurdagee ke aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he yaa real-time sarvice jaise ki videon strimming kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Two structural models are commonly used to describe protocols and methods used in inter-networking
 open system interconection sandarbh model ko antarrashtriya maanakeekaran sanghathan ke tatwadhan ke antargat viksit kiya gaya tha or yah yujar aplicationon main antarnihit hardware se software interfes avadharanaon tak leering protocol sambandhi kaaryon ke liye ek parishuddh vivaran pradaan karata he
 Inter-networking has been used in the network layer of the model
 internet protocol suite, jise internet kaa tisipi / ypi model bhi kaha jaataa he, ise oesai model ke anuroop dizin nahin kiya gaya tha or naa hi iskaa sambandh tippaniyon ke anurodh or internet maanakon ke kisi bhi maandand sambandhi vinirdesh se he
 Despite a similar appearance as a layered model, it uses a much less precise, lightly defined framework that relates only to aspects of logical networking
 yah hardware vishesh ke nimna-stareey interpheson kii charchaa nahin karata he or local network link main ek link layer interphes kii uplabdhta ko maanakar chalata he jisase host judaa hota he
 Inter-networking is facilitated by its Internet layer protocols

 In botanical reproduction, a botanical part originates a new tree and starts a new life, separated from the parent plant
 iske do prakaar, ek prakritik or doosraa kritrim, hai
 Natural botanical reproduction is of the following types: samudbhavan koshika main ek taraf yaa chaaron taraf anek pravaradh nikalakar matra koshika se alag hokar swatantra rup se pravardhan kar koshikaon kii shrunkhlaa banaate hai
 An example is yeast
 ek duusare prakaar ke samudbhavan ko jima samudbhavan kehete hai, jisamen paitruk pind ke kisi nikle bhaag se kaliyaan nikalakar usee ke saath lipati rahati hai, yaa alag ho jaati hai
 This is seen in genus moss, liververt and coral dendrophilia
 bhustari yaa ranor main jo paudhe sidhe khadey nahin ho sakate ve jameen par rengte hue badhate hai, unke upar ke bhaag par valkal patr rahete hai, jinke konon main kaliyaan rahati hai
 Thin thin roots between buds leave the ground and thus new plants are prepared
 doob ghaas iskaa udhaaharan he
 Sucker resembles landfall
 antar yah he ki sakar main jameen ke andar tanon par valkal patr hote hai or unke konon kii kaliyon se shakhaayen nikalakar hawa main chali jaati hai
 Shattered roots emerge from the floor of each branch and enter the ground
 pudinaa iskaa udhaaharan he
 The terrestrial or offset also spreads like terrestrial, but it is shorter and thicker than the terrestrial and creeps a short distance and produces a new plant at the end of the stem
 patrakand yaa balbil main akshakoniya kaliyaan hoti hai, jo adhik maatra main khaadya padaarth ekatrit ho jane se moti ho jaati hai or jameen par girane par nae paudhe ko janm detii hai
 Garlic, inflorescence, banalu or zaminkand, pineapple etc
 are examples of this
 prakand yaa risom ke upar valkal patr or neeche jhakadaa jaden hoti hai
 Sprouts come out from the buds of the angles of the letter and go into the air
 jaden pramukh risom se alag hokar vanshavistaar karti hai
 Examples are ginger, turmeric and ferns
 ghanakand yaa karm ke udhaaharan ghuiyaan or banda hai
 Below these lies a bloated stem called mandal
 iske upar valkalapatr kaa aavaran hota he
 They have buds in the angle, from which the seedlings go up on favorable weather and the roots come out from the bottom and go inside the earth
 is prakar nae paudhe utpann hote rahete hai
 The bulb is very dense, but its mandible is smaller and there are thick thick slices at the top
 andar kii pattee ke kone main kali rahati he, jo anukool mausam par nae tane ko janm detii he
 Onions are an example of this
 kand yaa tuber valkalapatron ke konon main kand lagata he
 The stem of the tuber remains bloated
 isamen khaadya sanchit rahata he
 Potato is a good example of this
 aalu par kaliyaan yaa aankhe hoti hai
 Each eye produces a plant
 jadon dwaara vanaspatik utpaadan main satawar, dalia or shakarkand kii jaden kand utpann karti hai, in kandon se phir nae paudhe utpann hote hai
 Leaves of some plants produce new plants in production by the leaves
 inhen patrakalika kehete hai
 Examples of this are Kuchi, Begonia, Parvanta, and Calancoi
 kuch fern main bhi isi reeti se janan hota he
 Some plants also breed artificially
 kuch paudhe tanon kii kataran se, kuch paudhe kalam baandhane se or kuch daab kalam se nae paudhon ko utpann karte hai
 The genetic purity of the plant can be maintained by artificial botanical reproduction, which is not fixed by the plant produced by the seed, and the reproduction is often certain
 aise janan ke liye khaadya padaarth paryaapt rahanaa chahie
 In its absence, the reproduction may be sexual or asexual

 hindko shabd kaise bana iske bare main kai vichaar prachlit hai
 The initial people coming to India from Asia and Iran established contact with this dialect after crossing the Hindukush mountain
 kyunki hindukush ko paar karne ke baad hindustan ke raste main koi khaas rukaawat nahin thi isi liye is boli ko hindustan kii boli yaa hindko kaha gaya
 The Greek people have used the word Indicos for Hindustan and that is why the dialect here is called Hindco
 kuch logon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki yah naam ise iraneeyon ne diya
 This language was spoken in the middle or front of the mountains of Sindh valley
 farsi main pahaad shabd ke liye koh shabd he or isi se yah shabd hindko bana

 Mahatma Gandhi first used the word Harijan in his statement and wrote, "it is true to say that those who are most in sorrow in India are Harijan
 Harijan means, devotee of God, beloved of God
 One of his hymns
 In the Bhaktavi Narsi Mehta has mentioned untouchable brothers with the word Harijan
 From this point of view, the word Harijan is suitable for untouchable brothers, i believe that
 " Editor-publisher of Moropant-bibliography R
 D
 Paradkar also saw the post of Harijan in an authentic verse of Moropant and told Mahatma Gandhi
 He said in his comment that the same evidence as Narsi Mehta is found in the compositions of other saints
 The name Harijan was free from the hatred of untouchables, Antyas, etc
, so this name immediately got social acceptance

 Expansion of main indo-aryan languages hind-arya bhashaayen hind-europea bhashaaon kii hind-irani shakha kii ek upashakha hai, jise 'bhartiya upashakha' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Most of these languages are Sanskrit-born
 hind-arya bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke 'gha', 'dha' or 'pha' jaise vyanjan parirakshit hai, jo anya shakhaon main lupt ho gayi hai
 This group includes these languages: Sanskrit, Hindi, Urdu, Bangla, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Punjabi, Nepali, Romani, Assamese, Gujarati, Marathi, etc
 gat do shatabdiyon main bhashavaigyanikon ne hind-arya bhashaaon ko kai prakaar se vargeekrut kara he or yah vyavasthaayen samay-samay par badalati rahi hai
 In modern times the following system is valid for most linguists and is based on the efforts of Masika and Kausen
 kuch ullekhneey bhashaayen hai: domari-romani and Paria were historically members of the central region but have undergone many grammatical and lexical changes due to geographical distance
 yah bhashaayen magadhi apbhransh se viksit hui hai
 These languages have evolved from Maharashtri Prakrit
 in dweepiya bhashaayen main kuch aapasi samantaayein hai jo mukhyabhumi kii hind-arya bhashaaon main upasthit nahin hai
 The following languages are related to each other but their class has not yet been categorized in the indo-aryan family: kusawaari chinali-lahul blacksmith nimnlikhit bhashaaon par adhik adhyayan nahin hua he or athnolog 17 main inhen hind-arya main avargeekrut likhaa gaya he: The Kholosi language has recently been spoken in two villages in southern Iran and is clearly an indo-aryan language but is not yet classified

 Legalizing black money is the art of hiding sources of illegally obtained money
 antat yah ek aisi prakriya he jiske dwaara aapraadhik aay ko vaid banaakar dikhaaya jaataa he
 The money involved can be obtained through a variety of criminal activities including drug bargaining, corruption, accounting and other forms of fraud and tax evasion
 kaale dhan ko vaid banane ke alag-alag tareeke ho sakate hai or iskaa vistaar saral se lekar jatil aadhuniktam takneekon ke rup main ho saktaa he
 Many regulatory and government authorities issue estimates every year for the amount of black money legalized worldwide or within their national economy
 1996 main antarrashtriya mudra kosh ne anumaan lagaaya tha ki duniya bhar main vaishvik arthvyavastha ke do se paanch pratishat hisse main kaale dhan ko vaid banane kaa maamla shaamil tha
 However, to counter the process of money laundering, an intergovernmental body, the FATF, was formed which acknowledged that "it is entirely impossible to provide a reliable estimate of the amount of money laundering as a whole" And hence no data in this context is published by the FATF
 isi prakaar shaikshik tippaneekar bhi sweekruti ke kisi bhi str tak is dhan kii maatra kaa anumaan lagane main asamarth rahe hai
 Despite the difficulty in measurement, the amount of black money that is legalized every year is in the billions and has become an important policy concern for governments
 iske parinaam swaroop sarkaron or antarrashtriya nikaayon dwaara kaale dhan ko vaid banane waalon ko daraane, rokane or pakadaney ke prayaas kiye gaye hai
 Similarly, efforts have been made by financial institutions to detect and prevent transactions related to black money, both as a result of the requirements of the government and to avoid the reputation-related risks involved
 kaale dhan ko vaid banane kii prakriya aksar teen charnon main puri hoti he: pehla, kuch madhyamon se vittiya pranali main nagdi ko daalaa jaataa he, duusare charan main avaidh strot ke chalaavaran ke kram main jatil vittiya lendenon ko nishpadit karnaa shaamil he or antim charan avaidh raashiyon ke lendenon se utpann dhan ko praapt karnaa aprihaary bana detaa he
 Some of these steps can be skipped depending on the circumstances; For example, there would be no need for placement of non-cash income already existing in the financial system
 kaale dhan ko vaid banane kii prakriya kai alag-alag roopon main sampann hoti he haalanki adhikansh tareekon ko inamen se kuch prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 These include "bank methods, smurfing, currency exchange and double-challan making"
 kai adhikaar-kshetron main kaale dhan ko vaid banane ke mukademon ke liye "self-londrar" ke rup main vishisht vidheyi aparaadhon kii ek suchi apanaai jaati he

 To prevent money laundering, a banker must take the following measures: europea sangh nirdesh 2005 / 60 / EC jo kaale dhan ko vaid banane or aatankwaadi vittaposhan ke liye weetiya pranali ke istemaal ko rokane ke liye banaaya gaya he, yah bainkon, real estate agenton or kai anya companiyon ke liye 15000 euro se adhik kii nakadi ke upyog kii jaanch or report ko anivaary kar is tarah ke aparaadhon ko rokane kii koshish karata he

 Recent activities to legalize black money in India have occurred through political parties, corporate companies and the stock market
 britain main kaale dhan ko vaid banane or aatankwaadi vittaposhan ke kaanoon kaa niyantran praathmik vidhaan ke chaar adhiniyamon dwaara niyantrit hota he:- The Criminal Income Act 2002 contains primary UK anti-money laundering legislation as well as necessary provisions for businesses within the "regulated sector" through which customers or other individuals suspected of money laundering are informed 
 britain main kaale dhan ko vaid banane kii prakriya ko vyapak rup se paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 In fact the operation or participation of any proceeds of any crime can be a crime to legalize black money
 kisi apradhi dwaara apane swayan ke aparaadh kii aay kaa swaamitv britain main kaale dhan ko vaid banane kii paribhaasha ke daayre main aata he
 This definition also includes activities that fall within the traditional definition of money laundering as a process by which the proceeds of crime are kept secret or hidden so that it comes from a legitimate source Seems to have happened
 kuch anya adhikaar kshetron ke vipareet, britain main kaale dhan ko vaid banane vaale aparaadh gambhir aparaadhon kii aay tak hi simit nahin hai, na hi vahaan koi maudrik seemaa he, na hi kaale dhan ko vaid banane ke kisi aparaadh kii maatra ke liye kisi karrwai kaa uddeshy yaa koi mani londering dizin banane kii koi aavashyaktaa he
 Under UK law, money is not required to be involved in any crime that legalizes black money because the law of money laundering includes property of any kind
 iske parinaam swarup koi bhi vyakti jo britain main ek arjansheel aparaadh karata he vah britain ke kanoon ke tahat anivaary rup se ek kaale dhan ko vaid banane kaa aparaadh bhi karata he
 This also applies to a person who escapes an obligation by criminal conduct - referred to by lawyers as "receiving a pecuniary benefit" - because it is deemed to be the kind of liability he thus escapes He has received an amount of equal value
 kaale dhan ko vaid banane vaale pramukh aparaadhon main adhiktam 14 saal ke karawas kii sajaa di jaati he
 Secondary regulation is provided by the Money Laundering Regulations 2003 and 2007
 is adhinium kaa ek parinaam yah he ki vakil, lekhaakaar or diwaliyapan ke vyavsaay main lage hue vyakti jo yah andeh vyakt karte hai ki unke graahak kar chori yaa anya aapraadhik gatividhiyon main shaamil hai jiske jariye unhone koi laabh praapt kiya he, ab unhen apane andeh kii soochna adhikariyon ko deni padati he 
 adhikansh paristhitiyon main yah kisi suchnadata dwaara apni soochna ke vishay kii jaankaree dene ke liye ki isaki ek soochna taiyaar kar lee gayi he, yah ek aparaadh kii 'gupt soochna' hogi
 While these provisions do not require disclosure of information to authorities in privileged circumstances or where information is subject to legal professional privilege, the information received by some professionals
 udyog samoohon ke saath-saath sanyukt mani londring sanchaalan samooh or lau sosayadi dwaara vyavsaayik maargdarshan pradaan kiye jate hai
 However, there is no obligation on banking institutions to provide regular notice of monetary deposits or transfers above a specified value
 isaki bajaay sabhi sandigdh jamaa yaa sthanantaranon kii soochna di jaani chahie bhale hi unka mulya kuch bhi ho
 Information obligations include reporting suspicions of benefits related to conduct in other countries that would be criminal in the UK
 baad main kuch khaas gatividhiyon ko chhod dene ke liye un apwaadon ko joda gaya jo us sthaan par vaid the jahaan ye gatividhiyaan hui thim, jaise ki spain main sandon kii ladaai
 There are more than 200,000 reports of suspicion of legalizing black money presented to the authorities annually in Britain
 Most of this information is presented by banks and similar financial institutions
 haalanki 30 sitambar 2010 ko samaapt hue varsh main 5,108 vibhinn sanghathanon ne adhikariyon ke samaksh sandigdh gatividhi kii report pesh kii thi jabaki sabhi soochnaaon kaa lagbhag aadha hissaa sirf chaar sanghathanon dwaara prastut kiya gaya tha or sabhi soochnaaon main teen-chauthai kii bhagidaari sheersh 20 reporting sanghathanon kii thi
 There is a provision of imprisonment for a maximum of 5 years for the offense of failing to report any suspicion of money laundering by someone else
 britain main sabhi beuro di change maharani sahiba ke rajasav or seemaa shulk vibhaag ke saath panjikrut hai jo prayek sthaan ke liye ek vyapaarik license jari karata he
 Bureau de change and money changers such as Western Union outlets in the UK fall within the "regulated area" and are required to comply with the Money Laundering Regulations 2007
 sabhi dhan seva vyavsaayon par echemarsi dwaara jaanch kiya ja saktaa he
 The approach to stop the money laundering in the United States has been divided into two areas by utility: preventive measures and criminal measures
 pehle charan main america vittiya pranali main kaale dhan ko pravesh karne se rokane ke prayaas main sanyukt rajya congress ne kanoonon kii ek shrinkhalaa paarit kii he jisaki shuruyaat 1990 main hui thi jise sanyukt rup se bank sikresi act ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 These laws, which are included in sections 5311 to 5332 of Title 31 of the United States Code, require such financial institutions to include a comprehensive table of entities under the current definition including banks, credit card companies, life insurers, money service businesses and Broker-dealers of securities are required to report certain transactions to the United States Treasury

 is din kuch juluus, dharne, pradarshan, bhaashan to hote hai; par usase saamaanya logon ke man par koi asar nahin hota
 On the other hand, there has been an incident in India's history on September 5, 1730, which cannot be compared in the world
 rajasthan tathaa bharat ke anek anya kshetron main bishnoi samudaay ke log rahete hai
 His Guru Jambheshwar Ji gave 29 rules to his followers such as not to cut green trees, not to kill animals and birds and not to waste water
 in 20 + 9 niyamon ke kaaran unke shishy bishnoi kehalaate hai
 Being environment-friendly, animals and birds roam fearlessly in their villages
 1730 main in paryaavaran-premiyon ke sammukh pariksha kii vah mahatvapurn ghadi aayi thi, jisamen uteern hokar inhone vishwa-itihaas main swayan ko amar kar liya
 In 1730, Ajay Singh, the Jodhpur King, needed lime for the construction work in his palace and he needed fuel to cook it
 unke aadesh par sainikon ke saath saikadon lakadahare nikatavarti gaanv khejadli main shami vrikshon ko kaatane chal diye
 As soon as this news was received by the Bishnois living in that area, they started opposing it
 jab sainik nahin maane, to ek saahsee mahila ‘imarti devi’ ke netritv main saikadon gramvasi; jinamein bachche or bade, stri or purush sab shaamil the; pedo se lipat gayi
 He told the soldiers that only after cutting his body, a green tree will be cut
 sainikon par bhala in baton kaa kya asar hona tha ? ve rajgna se bandhe the, to gramvasi dharmagna se
 Therefore, along with trees, the limbs of the villagers were also cut and started falling on the earth
 sabase pehle virangana ‘imarti devi’ par hi kulhadiyon ke nirmam prahaar hue or vah vriksh-raksha ke liye praan dene vaali vishwa kii pehali mahila ban gayi
 Encouraged by this sacrifice, the villagers clung to the trees with full force
 20veen shatee main gadhwal main gaura devi, chandiprasad bhatta tathaa sundarlal bahuguna ne vrikshon ke sangrakshan ke liye ‘chipko aandolan’ chalaaya, uski preranarot imarti devi hi thim
 This sacrifice festival started on Bhadrapad Shukla 10 and lasted for 27 days
 is dauraan 363 logon ne balidaan diya
 Among them were 69 women including three daughters of Imrati Devi
 antatah raja ne swayan aakar kshamaa maangi or hare pedo ko kaatane par pratibandh laga diya
 The villagers had no hatred for him, they forgave the king
 us aitihaasik ghatana kii yaad main aaj bhi vahaan ‘bhadrapada shukla 10’ ko bada mela lagata he
 The Rajasthan government has started giving 'amrita Devi Bishnoi Smriti Award' for forest, wildlife and environment protection and the Central Government has given 'amrita Devi Bishnoi Award'
 yah balidaan vishwa itihaas kii anupam ghatana he
 Therefore, this date is eligible to be the actual 'world Environment Day'

 madhya pradesh or gujarat kii seemaa par badi sankhya main bhil janajati ke log based hai
 Shri Baleshwar Dayal earned a deity-like reputation among these clashes of the brave soldiers of Maharana Pratap by his service and dedication
 mamaa ji kaa janm paanch sitambar, 1906 ko gram newadi main hua tha
 Due to his interest in service work, destiny brought him to Madhya Pradesh and then he continued to work among the Bhils throughout his life
 1937 main unhone jhabua jile main ‘baamaniya ashram’ kii neenv rakhi tathaa bheelon main vyaapt kuritiyon ko dur karne main jute gayi
 This angered the then zamindars, Mahajan and Raja and closed them in jail; But with the tortures there, his determination became more determined
 kuch samay baad ek seth ne unase prabhavit hokar ‘thandala’ main unhen apane makaan kii upree manzil bina kiraaye ke de di
 Here Mama Ji built a hostel
 dhire-dhire sthaneey logon main vishwaas jaagane laga
 After a severe famine of 1937, Christian missionaries came there for relief work; But he was less interested in service and more in conversion
 yah dekhakar mamaa ji ne puri ke shankaracharya kii likhit sahmati se bheelon ko cross ke badale janeu dilvaaya
 Some conservative Hindu institutions opposed it; But Mama ji knew very well the actual situation in that area
 atah ve is kaary main lage rahe
 This greatly hindered the conversion there
 dhire-dhire unki charchaa sarvatra hone lagi
 Seth Jugalkishore Birla built a grand Ram temple on the hill near Bamnia station
 aaj bhi uski dekharekh unke parivarajanon kii ore se hi hoti he
 The missionaries were to build churches there; But Mama ji failed his conspiracy
 mamaa ji arya samaaj tathaa socialist party se bhi jude rahe
 Leaders like Subhash Chandra Bose, Acharya Narendra Dev, Jayaprakash Narayan, Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia, Chaudhary Charan Singh, George Fernandes used to visit his ashram; But maternal uncle gave priority to service rather than politics
 mamaa ji kaa janm ek sampann parivaar main hua tha; par jab unhone seva vrath sweekaar kiya, to phir ve bheelon kii bich unki tarah hi rahane lage
 They also ate with them thick breads of gram, barley and sardine flour
 ashram dwaara prakashit patrika ‘gobar’ kaa chah varsh tak mamaa ji ne sampaadan kiya
 He died at the ashram on 26 December 1998
 mamaa ji ke dehant ke baad ashram main hi unki samadhi banaakar pratimaa sthapit kii gayi
 The then food minister Sharad Yadav and railway minister Nitish Kumar had come there at the time of its unveiling
 nikatavarti jilon ke bhil mamaa ji ko devtaa samaan maanate hai tathaa aaj bhi saal kii pehali fasal ashram ko bhent karte hai
 a conference is held there three times every year, where thousands of people gather and pay homage to Mama ji
 baamaniya ashram se padhe anek chaatr aaj unchi sarkari evam nijee sevaaon main hai
 Remembering his eye service, 'mama ji', he becomes inaudible

 a monitor or display is an electronic visual display built for computers
 monitor main disple upkaran, circuitary or ek inclozar shaamil hota he
 The display equipment of modern monitors is usually a thin panel of a thin film transistor liquid crystal display, whereas older monitors use a cathode ray tube that is approximately the size of the screen
 mul rup se computer monitoron kaa istemaal data processing or manoranjan ke liye television resiwaron ke taur par kiya jaataa tha; data processing ke saath-saath manoranjan ke liye bhi computaron ke istemaal main uttarottar vruddhi ho rahi he
 Specifically, the display used for data has an aspect ratio of 4: 3; The aspect ratio of the display used for entertainment is also usually 16: 9 widescreen and sometimes its coordinate form like 16:10 is also used
 lagbhag ek ytaakar disple ke aakaar ko aam taur par do vipareet screen konon ke bich kii duuri arthath aayat ke vikarn ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 One problem with this method is that it does not take into account the display aspect ratio, so for example the height and area of a 16: 9 21 inch widescreen display is much lower than a 21 inch 4: 3 screen
 4:3 screen kaa aayam 16
8 inch × 12
6 inch or kshetrafal 211 varg inch hota he jabaki widescreen kaa aayam or kshetrafal kramshah 18
3 inch × 10
3 inch or 188 varg inch hota he
 The height of the display is considered the main criterion for many purposes; a 16: 9 display has a diagonal of 22% larger than a 4: 3 display of the same height
 maap ke is tareeke ko siarti television kii pehali peedi ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale tareeke se liya gaya he jab aam taur par vrittakar agrabhag vaale pikchar tub kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 Being circular, only their diameter was needed to describe their shape
 chunki in vrittakar tubon kaa istemaal ytaakar chitron ko pradarshit karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha isliye aayat ke vikarn kii maap tub ke agrabhag ke vyas ke baraabar thi
 This method continued to be used even when cathode ray tubes were constructed as round rectangles; It had the advantage of being the only number specifying the size and there was no confusion when the aspect ratio was 4: 3 everywhere
 prachaar evam vigyaapan samagriyon main monitor ke aakaar kaa varnan karte samay isaki darshneey chhavi ke bajaay iske chhavi tatv ke aakaar kaa istemaal ek jatil prakriya thi
 a large portion of the CRT screen in the CRT display is hidden or covered behind the case bezels to hide areas outside the "safe area" of the monitor due to overscan
 in prathaon yaa prakriyaaon ko bhraamak mana jaataa tha or vyapak upabhokta aapatti or mukademon kii vajah se zyaadaatar nirmaataaon ko ant main darshneey aakaar ko maapne par majaboor hona padaa
 The performance of a monitor is measured based on the following criteria: anukool tark: Adverse Argument: anukool tark: Adverse Argument: anukool tark: Adverse Argument: phosphor bern-in ek siarti screen kii phosphor kii parat kii sthaniyakrut umr he jahaan isane lambey samay tak sthir chhavi kaa pradarshan kiya he
 This results in the creation of a fuzzy image on the screen, even permanently
 iske gambhir maamalon main bhi kuch paathya shabdon ko padhanaa sambhav ho saktaa he haalaanki aisa keval vahiin hota he jahaan pradarshit paath saalon se yathaavat rah gaye hon
 Burn-in or burn problems are most commonly seen in the following applications: bern-in se bachane ke ek saadhan ke rup main screensevar kaa vikaas kiya gaya jo 1980 ke dashak main ibiem personal computer monocrome monitoron kii ek vyapak samasya thi
 The risk of burn-in is generally higher on monochrome displays because phosphor is directly in front of the electron beam while in color displays there is some protection from shadow masks
 nae computaron main abhi bhi paae jane ke baavjood alsidi monitoron main screen sever kaa hona jaruri nahin hai
 Phosphor burn-in can be "corrected" by running the CRT with 100% brightness for several hours but it only hides the damage by burning all phosphors equally
 siarti punarnirmaataa pikchar tub ke saamne vaale hisse ko katkar, kshatigrast phosphor ko nikaalkar, use badalakar or tub ko phir se sil karke monocrome disple kii marammat kar sakate hai
 Color displays can theoretically be corrected, but this is a difficult and expensive process and is usually done only on professional broadcast monitors
 bern-in kii samasya ek baar phir se aarambhik plasma disple ke liye ek chintaa ke vishay ke rup main ubhar uthaa jin par siarti kii tulana main iskaa adhik khatra hota he
 Screen savers with moving images can be used to reduce the occurrence of localized burns
 pehle se istemaal main rahane vaali rang yojana main samay-samay par parivartan karne se bhi isamen madad milti he
 Brightness is a problem caused by the connection between the light and the screen, or by using monitors in bright sunlight
 mat finnish alsidi or screen siarti par paaramparik ghumaavdaar siarti yaa chamakdaar alsidi or epperchar gril siarti kii tulana main pratibimbit chamak kaa kam khatra hota he jo keval ek aksh par mude hote hai or donon akshon par mude hue anya siarti kii tulana main in par kam khatra hota he
 If the problem persists despite moving the monitor or adjusting the lighting, a filter can be installed on the screen using a mesh of black wire very frequently to reduce glare and improve contrast
 ye filter 1980 ke dashak ke antim daur main kaaphi lokapriy the
 They also reduce light yield
 uparokt ullikhit filter keval paravartak chamak ke khilaaf hi kaam karegaa; pratyaksh chamak puri tarah se monitoron kii zyaadaatar aatanrik prakaash vyavastha ko mitaa degaa or inase keval ek hood yaa transriflactive alsidi ke istemaal se hi nipta ja saktaa he
 Except for properly aligned video projectors and sorted leds, most display technologies have an inherent misregistration of color channels, especially in lcds, ie the centers of red, green, and blue dots are not well lined

 The functional similarity of the electromechanical predecessors led to the labeling of glass teletypes on early crt-based vdus such as DEC VT05 with no graphics capability
 kuch aitihaasik computaron main koi screen disple nahin tha or iske bajaay unamem teletip, sanshodhit electric tiperiter yaa printer kaa istemaal hota tha
 Early home computers such as the Apple Two and Commodore 64 used a composite signal output to run a TV or color composite monitor
 iske parinamswaroop prayukt prasaaran tivi maanakon main asaamanyataon kii vajah se rijolushan kaa str neeche gir gaya
 This method is still used with video game consoles
 rijolushan main sudhaar karne ke liye camodor monitor main es-video input kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha lekin echditivi ke aagaman tak televisionon main yah aam nahin tha
 Early digital monitors are sometimes called ttls because the voltage of the red, green, and blue inputs was consistent with TTL logic chips
 parvarti digital monitor alvidies yaa tmds protocolon kaa samarthan karte hai
 The monitors used with the MDA, Hercules, CGA and EGA graphics adapters used in early IBM pcs and clones were controlled via TTL logic
 aise monitoron kii pahchaan aam taur par video cabel main istemaal hone vaale mail dei-9 conector se kii ja sakati he
 One drawback of TTL monitors was that the number of colors available was limited because of the low number of digital bits used for video signals
 aadhunik monocrome monitoron main maanak rangeen monitoron ke rup main usee 15-pin vaale esavijie conector kaa istemaal hota he
 They are capable of performing 32-bit grayscale at 1024x768 resolution which enables them to interface with modern computers
 titiel monocrome monitoron main nau main se keval paanch pin kaa hi istemaal hota tha
 One pin was used as the base and two pins were used for horizontal or vertical synchronization
 rekhaankit pixlon kii ujjvalata ko niyantrit karne ke liye electron gan ko do alag alag digital signlon, ek video bit or ek tivrata bit, dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa tha
 Only four sheds were possible; Black, dim, medium or bright
 rangeen siarti main istemaal hone vaale teen electron ganon ko niyantrit karne ke liye sijie monitoron main chaar digital sanketon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha jise sanket ke tareeke kii drushti se arjibiai yaa red green and blue plus intencity ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Each of these three RGB colors can be switched on or off independently
 tivrata bit sabhi chaalu ganon kii ujjvalata ko badhaata he yaa agar koi rang chaalu na ho to tivrata bit ek gahare bhure rang kaa nirmaan karne ke liye bahut kam ujjvalata par sabhi ganon ko chaalu karegaa
 The CGA monitor is capable of rendering only 16 colors
 sijie monitor kaa istemaal khaas taur par pisi aadhaarit hardware dwaara nahin kiya jaataa tha
 Commodore 128 could also use CGA monitors
 kai sijie monitor ek alag jaik ke madhyam se compojit video ko pradarshit karne main sakasham tha
 Six digital signals were used in EGA monitors to control three electrons, known as RRGGB in terms of signal
 sijie ke vipareet yahan prayek gan ko khud kaa apana tivrata bit aavantit kiya jaataa he
 This helped each of the three primary colors achieve four different positions resulting in the creation of 64 colors
 mul ibiem vinirdesh main samarthit na hone ke baavjood clon graphics adapter ke kai vikritaon ne becoward monitor compatibility or auto ditection ko karyanvit kiya he
 For example, EGA cards manufactured by Paradise can be operated as an MDA or CGA adapter if a monochrome or CGA monitor was used in place of an EGA monitor
 kai sijie card bhi emd yaa harculas card ke rup main sanchalit hone main sakasham the, agar monocrome monitor kaa istemaal kiya gaya ho
 Green and amber phosphors were used in most monochrome displays in the 1970s and 1980s
 safed asaamaanya tha kyonki iskaa nirmaan karnaa adhik mahangaa tha haalaanki aipal ne lisa or aarambhik macintosh main istemaal kiya tha
 Most modern computer displays can display different colors of the RGB color space by converting red, green, and blue analog video signals into continuously variable sharpies
