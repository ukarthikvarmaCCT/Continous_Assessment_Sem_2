 Some groups like the Alawites are believing that Ali was God incarnate
 islamic vidwaanon ke bahumat se unhen gulaat ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 According to traditional Muslims, Islam has been abandoned in these groups because of the exaggeration of human admirable qualities

 According to him, Kaitani's approach is inconsistent

 Radha is also often called Radhika, is the predominant goddess in Hinduism, especially in the Vaishnava sect
 vah krishna kii premika or sangi ke rup main chitrit kii jaati hai
 Thus he is worshiped as Radha Krishna
 unke upar kai kavy rachana kii gai he or raas lila unheen kii kahaniyon ke upar banaaya gaya he
 Radha is also considered as "lakshmi" form in Vaishnavism
 The religious communities of India, Nimbark and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu are also included in Radha
 aisa mana jaataa he ki jab krishnaji vrindavan chhodkar ja rahe the tab unhone radha se vaada kiya tha ki ve lautakar aayenge lekin unki yatra ke dauraan unki mulaakaat rukmani se hui jo man hi man unhen apana pati maan chuki thim
 jab rukmani kaa vivaah kisi duusare se karaayaa ja rahaa tha tab krishna ji vahaan pahunch gaye or unase shaadi kar lee
 Very little space is read to describe what happened next to Radha
 But according to one belief, Radha got married to a Yadav after Krishna ji left
 This is described in the Brahmavaivarta Purana, which describes Radha's husband, composed by Vedavyasa
 puraana ke anusaar hi radha kaa vivaah yashoda ke bhai rayan gopa se ho gai thi or radha rishte main krishna kii maami lagane lagi thi, isliye bhi uthhone shaadi nahin kii thi
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki radha ne apana ghar chhod diya tha or ek parchaai apane ghar par chodi thi, usee se gopa kii shaadi kii gai thi
 Sri Krishna is considered to have a spiritual relationship with Rukmini and a spiritual relationship with Radha
 rukmini or radha kaa darshan bahut gaharaa he
 Combining this with the philosophy of the whole world, there are three stages of the whole world
 joki kramash: sthool, sookshm, kaaran hai
 The gross that is visible which we can see with our eyes and touch with our hands is called Rukmini in Krishna-darshan
 sookshm jo dikhaai nahin detaa or jise ham na netron se dekh sakate hai na hi sparsh kar sakate hai, use keval mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he vahi radha he or jo in sthool or sookshm avasthaaon kaa kaaran he vah hai shrikrishna or yahi krishna is mul sristi kaa charachar hai

 raman prakirnan yaa raman prabhaav photone kanon ke lacheele vitaran ke bare main he
 It was discovered by the famous Indian scientist Mr
 CV Raman
 raman prabhaav ke anusaar, jab koi ekvarni prakaash dravon or thoson se hokar gujarata he to usamen aaptit prakaash ke saath atyalp tivrata kaa kuch anya varnon kaa prakaash dekhne main aata he
 In 1930, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Chandrasekhar Venkataraman for his discovery
 raman kii puri shiksha-diksha bharat main hi hui
 Rs 200 itself By designing a spectrometer, we could make such an important discovery only on the strength of diligence, diligence and exclusive research
 shuru main raman ne surya ke prakaash ko bangnee filter se guzaar kar praapt bangnee prakaash kiran punj ko drav se guzaara
 The output beam was mainly of purple color, but after passing through the green filter, the presence of green rays in it was also seen in very small quantity
 raman prabhaav rasinic yogicon kii aantarik sanrachana samajhane ke liye bhi mahatvapurn he
 This effect is quite an important discovery for scientists
 rashtriya vigyaan diwas ke din bharat ke vibhinn kshetron main vigyaan ke gatividhiyon kon badhaava dene vaale kaarykamo kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 After repeating the experiment on more than 60 different liquids, it was ensured that all the fluids represented the Raman spectrum
 drav badalane se keval usase prakirnit spectrumi rekha kaa rang badalata he
 In the experiments so far, the effect was being confirmed by just looking
 kintu raman jaanate the ki jab tak raman-rekhaon kii tarangadairdhyon or unki aapekshik tivrata kaa maapan nahin kiya jayega tab tak na to prabhaav kii santoshjanak vyakhya kii ja sakegi or na hi vaigyanik jagat main manyata praapt hogi
 For this he used a quartz spectrograph, the quantitative results of which were published in the Indian Journal of Physics on March 31, 1928
 yah ek adbhut prabhaav he, isaki khoj ke ek dashak baad hi 2000 rasinic yogicon kii aantarik sanrachana nishchit kii gai thi
 After this, the internal structure of the crystal was also explored
 raman prabhaav ke anusaar prakaash kii prakruti or swabhaav main tab parivartan hota he jab vah kisi paardarshee madhyam se nikalataa he
 This medium can be anything solid, fluid and gaseous
 yah ghatana tab ghatati he, jab madhyam ke anu prakaash urja ke kanon ko prakirnit kar dete hai
 This happens in the same way as the striker splashes the pieces on the carrom board
 photone kii urja yaa prakaash kii prakruti main hone vaale atisookshm parivartanon se madhyam kii aantarik anu sanrachana kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Raman was a very enthusiastic, hard working, and brilliant man
 19 varsh kii aayu main unhone pratham shrenee main pratham rahete hue bhautikee main em

 kiya or vitt sevaaon kii pratiyogi pariksha main safal hokar kalakatta main upmahaalekh adhikri ban gaye
 The desire to pass some taxes and interest in science linked him to the Indian Association for Cultivation of Sciences, a science research institute established by Mahendra Lal Sarkar
 ve din bhar apane daayitv kaa nirvaah karne main vyast rahete or shaam se der raat tak prayogshaala main
 His early work was related to the exploration of science associated with the working of musical instruments
 raman kaa vigyaan ke prati samarpan itnaa teevr tha ki 1917 main jab unhen kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee ke palit professor banaae jane kaa prastaav mila to apni sarkari naukari chhodkar lagbhag aadhi tankhaah par unhone is pad ko sweekaar kar liya
 Raman's entire education took place in India and till now his contact with other scientists of the world was through books and articles printed in international research papers
 1921 main pehali baar ek adhyayan yatra par unhen videsh jane kaa avasar mila
 The blue-blue waters of the ocean caught their attention while traveling by ship
 lard raile ne akaash ke nile rang kii safal vyakhya vayukanon se prakaash-vikirnan ke aadhaar par kii thi kintu sagar jal kaa nila rang unhone akaash kaa jal main pratibimb maan liya tha
 This interpretation was not acceptable to Raman
 unako lagata tha ki jo siddhant vaayu ke nile rang ke liye uttaradaayi tha vahi jal ke nile rang ke liye bhi hona chahie, isliye, apni vaapasi yatra main unhone ek jebi spectrummapi apane saath rakhaa
 Ss During the voyage on a vessel called Narkunda, he carried out some experiments of scattering from glaciers and water with the help of this device
 bharat pahunchate-pahunchate unhen vishwaas ho gaya ki unka vichaar sahi tha
 He sent 'a short article to Nature in this regard and got absorbed in his experiments with light scattering with his team of young scientists
 7 varsh ke athak parishram or saikadon dravon evam thoson se prakaash-prakirnan kaa adhyayan karne ke baad aakhir 28 farvari, 1928 ko unhone raman prabhaav kii ghoshnaa kii
 Since 1987, this day has been celebrated in India as National Science Day
 raman prabhaav kii upyukt vyakhya keval kwantum siddhant ke aadhaar par kii ja sakati he, jahaan ekvarni prakaash punj ko urja yukt kanon ke pravaah ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 When these photons collide with the particles of the medium, they either have elastic collisions that emit waves of essentially the same frequency or unpredictable collisions that can also provide spectral lines of longer wavelengths than incident radiation and shorter wavelengths
 Also spectral lines of

 An effective tool for physicists Early Raman effect was used in research studies by physicists
 pehle 7 varshon main is prabhaav ko aadhaar bana kar 700 se adhik vaigyanik shodh patr prastut kiye gaye
 On the one hand, in terms of theoretical physics, this effect provided a strong basis for quantum physics, while on the other hand it gave experimental physicists a highly efficient, simple technique for studying the structures of crystals and molecules
 phir dhire-dhire bhautikavidon kii is nai takanic main ruchi kam hone lagi
 But by then this technique was becoming popular among chemists as an analytical tool
 rasayanagyon ke aujaar ke rup main prayek padaarth kaa apana vishisht spectrum hota he
 Therefore, mixtures could also be chemically analyzed without destroying the substance and the material could be organic or inorganic by its signature in the Raman spectrum
 saath hi spectrumi rekhaon kii tivrata kii tulana se unke saapeksh pariman kii upasthiti kaa akalan bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 It was a widespread technique and could also be used for gases and solids in addition to liquids
 kintu dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad sugrahi sansuchakon or electronic main hue vikaas ke kaaran vaigyanikon ko avarakt spectrummiti raman spectrummiti se saral lagane lagi or raman prabhaav ke anuprayogon kii ore rujhaan kuch kam hua
 But the Raman effect again became popular among scientific inventors from the 1960s after the discovery of laser
 raman prabhaav ke sansuchan main sabase kathin samasya yah thi ki raman rekhaaen bahut ksheen hoti thim isliye unke sansuchan ke liye atyant teevr prakaash strot kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The laser not only provided such a very intense light source, but introduced new effects in the scattering light that added new dimensions to Raman spectrometry
 parinamswaroop raman spectroscopy ke anek parivartt viksit hue
 The basic concepts used in these include paginated Raman for sensitivity enhancement, Raman microscopy for improving spatial resolution, and resonance Raman for highly specific information acquisition
 in sankalpanaaon ke samakalan se anek bhinn-bhinn raman spectrum takneekein viksit kii gai hai
 Commercial Raman spectrometers became available from the late 1980s after the application of computers to furrier conversion techniques and data management, and no field is now untouched by applications of the Raman effect
 jahaan bhi sample ko bina kshati pahunchaae, drutagati se padaarth vishesh ke kuch kan pahchaan kar nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hon, vahaan raman prabhaav sabase adhik prabhavi takanic pradaan karata he

 vyaktiyon, pariwaron yaa anya shrenee ke logon kaa samaaj ke ek varg se duusare varg main gati saamaajik gatishiltaa kehalaati he
 As a result of this motion, the social status of that person or family relative to others changes in that society
 saamaajik gatishiltaa se abhipraay vyakti kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak pahunchne se hota he
 When a person moves from one place to another, we generally consider it to be the action of moving in the common language
 parantu is prakaar kii gatishiltaa kaa koi mahatv samajashastreey adhyayan main nahin he
 In sociological studies, mobility refers to attaining status from one position to another in a social system, as a result of which the dynamic person's position in this stratified social system rises up and goes down
 ek sthaan se upar uthakar duusare sthaan ko praapt kar lenaa, jo usase unchaa he, nihsandeh gatishiltaa he
 In simple words, it can be said that social mobility in sociology means change in the prestige of an individual, group or category
 praayah is prakaar kii gatishiltaa kaa ullekh mote taur par vyavsaayik kshetra tathaa samaajik varg main parivartan se hota he
 Social mobility is often seen as a sign of free or backwardness in this society
 saamaajik gatishiltaa ke adhyayan main gatishiltaa kii daren, va vyakti kii niyukti bhi shaamil kii jaati he
 In this context, the exchange of a family member or rise or fall in a social context involves from one generation to another
 es em lipset tathaa aar bendix kaa maananaa tha ki audyogic samaaj ke swaamitv ke liye saamaajik gatishiltaa aavashyak he
 JH Gould Thorpe, while discussing social mobility in England, talks about its three important features - pi sorokin ne saamaajik gatishiltaa ke nimna do prakaar kaa ullekh kiya he- When a person transfers from one group to another at the same level, it is called horizontal social mobility
 is prakaar kii gatishiltaa main vyakti kaa pad vahi rahata he keval sthaan main parivarttan aata he
 For example, it can be said that many times in government offices there are routine transfers in which a teacher who was teaching in one city is transferred from that city to another city
 isi prakaar sena main kaam kar rahe jawan kaa bhi ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par bheja janaa bina kisi padonnati ke ek rutin tabadalaa he
 When a person is asked to work on a position above or below a post, it is called vertical social mobility
 udhaaharan ke liye ek shikshak ko padonnati kar use prisimple bana dena tathaa ek soobedaar ko sena main tarakkee dekar use capten kaa pad dena lambavat saamaajik gatishiltaa ke udhaaharan hai
 If there can be progress in the post in vertical social mobility, then the decline in the post can also be seen
 udhaaharan ke liye capten ke pad se hataakar waapas ek jawan ko soobedaar bana dena bhi sambhav he jo lambavat saamaajik gatishiltaa ke udhaaharan maane ja sakate hai
 There are two subtypes of vertical social mobility - is prakaar kii gatishiltaa lambavat saamaajik gatishiltaa kaa hi up prakaar he jahaan ek hi disha main arthath padonnati yaa tarakkee kii sthiti hoti he
 The promotion of a school teacher to principal after promotion and the appointment of an army soldier to the post of subedar are examples of vertical upward mobility
 yah bhi ek lambavat saamaajik gatishiltaa kaa up-prakaar he parantu isamen padonnati ke bajaay pad main giravat aati he
 If a principal is asked to work in the post of teacher and similarly an army jawan should be removed from the captain to a sergeant, then these are examples of vertical downward mobility
 is prakaar saamaajik gatishiltaa ne mukhya rup se in do prakaaron kii charchaa kii gayi he
 Brum and Seljanić have emphasized the study of the change in social status on various aspects of both objective and subjective approaches by the establishment approach
 unka kahana tha ki bahut se samajashastreey adhyayanon main bhi iskaa varnan kiya gaya he
 In a family too, there are differences in the positions of the two related to the occupation between father and son
 agar putr kaa vyavsaayik pad apane pita ke apekshaakrit unchaa ho jaataa he or kalantar main us putr ke putr kaa bhi vyavsaayik pad apane pita se unchaa ho jaye to is prakaar ke padonnati ko vanshanugat gatishiltaa kaha ja saktaa he
 In this way, the progress in the positions in the business sector can be studied and the sociological study of the dynamics in his career can be done on the basis of the establishment approach
 yah bataanaa bhi aasaan ho jaataa he ki ek parivaar kii jeevanavritti main gatishiltaa kii daren tathaa uski disha kis taraf rahi he
 Kingsley Davis has studied the change in positions related to caste and class in the study of social mobility
 unka maananaa tha ki jati or varg saamaajik gatishiltaa ke adhyayan ke do mahatvapurn udhaaharan hai
 Where there is no mobility in caste, mobility is found in class
 bhartiya sandarbh main em en shrinivas ne jati main gatishiltaa kaa saanskritikaran kii avadharana ke dwaara vistaar se adhyayan kiya he
 He believed that social status in a caste is determined by the birth of all, which is permanent, but on the basis of a dignified approach, many lower caste people use many methods to elevate their status so that they are higher caste So that they can come at par with the people of is prakaar apni sthiti ko upar uthaane kii koshish aksar nimna stareey jati ke logon main paayi jaati he
 They found that lower caste people often want to elevate their position by following the behavior of upper caste people and following the prevailing cultural norms
 jin jatiyon main pehle upanayan sanskaar kaa prachlan nahin tha ve is sanskaar ke dwaara apni sthiti ko unchaa uthaanaa chaahate hai
 The lower caste people also found that the upper caste people do not take disheartening food along with many religious rituals
 nimna jati ke logon ne apane aap ko unchi jati ke kareeb laane ke liye niraamish bhojan ko laakar dharmik anushthanon ko bhi maananaa shuru kar diya or is prakaar ke kalpit rup se karmkaandon main badlaav laakar apane aap ko unchi jati ke sameep laane kaa prayaas shuru kiya
 This process is called 'sanskritization' by MN Srinivas
 parantu kai anya samajashastriyon ne yah mana he ki saanskritikaran ke madhyam se jati ke sthaan main koi lambavat gatishiltaa nahin aati he balki nimna jati ko aisa lagata he ki unki pratishtha main badlaav aayaa he or sambhawatah isliye apni pratishtha main badlaav laane ke vichaar se adhikansh nimna jati ke log hi apane vyavhaar main is prakaar kaa parivarttan laane kii koshish main lage rahete hai
 It can undoubtedly be said that the changes in caste due to the notion of social mobility are an important reason for change in education, income and profession, and the contribution of this concept is very important in the sociological study to identify the right situation
