 Within the cartography, the method of transferring the latitude and longitude lines of the globe to the plane plane is called map interpolation
 is prakaar khinchi hui akshansh evam deshaantar rekhaon ko "rekhajaal" kaha jaataa he
 It is not possible to move the latitude and longitude lines of the globe purely on a plane plane, because the curve plane of the globe cannot be leveled without any inaccuracy
 prakshepon ke vikaas ke praarambhik kaal main vidwaanon ne prakshepon kii aspasht vidhiyon se swarg ko pradarshit karne kii cheshtaa kii thi
 Probably the first invention of interpolation was done by Thelj sir in 600 BC
 i did
 vastav main yah cendrak khamadhya prakshep tha jise janmapatrak bhi kaha gaya
 300 BC invented real interpolation
 The first latitude line was drawn on a map drawn by Diaccius, a resident of Sicily
 prakshep ke vikaas ke itihaas main iratostheniz, tolmi tathaa macentre ke jeevankaal mahatvapurn rahe hai
 Thereafter, development and modification of projections continued continuously
 kisi bhi maanchitr athwa uske kisi bhi bhaag kii akshansh deshaantar rekhaon ko sthanantarit karne ke liye globe ko kisi vikashneey prishth se dhankkar athwa kisi samtal dharaatal ko globe ke kisi bindu par sparsh karti hui sthiti main rakhkar kisi dhyutimaan bindu se prakaash daalaa jaataa he or is prakaar akshansh deshaantar rekhaon kii chaaya prakshipt kii jaati he
 Permanent lines are drawn on this shadow itself
 taduparant vikashneey prishth ko kisi vishesh deshaantar par katkar khol diya jaataa he
 These are called geometric or perspective interpolation
 uparyukt kriya ko shishe ke athwa taar ke bane globe kii sahaayta se saraltapurvak sampann kiya jaataa he
 It is not always possible that projections are made using the above method
 bahudhaa aisi aavashyaktaa padati he ki kisi vishesh dhyey se prakshep bananaa hota he jisamen jyamitiya athwa sandarsh vidhi kii avhelnaa kerani padati he or ganit ke siddhanton evam gananaaon ke aadhaar par akshansh tathaa deshaantar rekhaayen bina kisi chaaya ko prakshipt kiye kaagaj par khinch lee jaati hai
 These are called Ajayamitiya or non-random projection
 ye adhik upyogi hote hai
 From the point of view of the map, the map has three characteristics: isosphere, normalized and pure direction
 ye teenon visheshtaayen saath saath kisi bhi prakshep par shuddh rup se praapt nahin kii ja saktin
 Each projection lacks one or the other of these features
 in visheshtaon ko shuddh rup main dhaaran karanevaale prakshepon ke naam nimnlikhit hai : Isolation Trajectories: The area of the latitudinal quadrilateral formed on the trajectory of these trajectories is proportional to the area of the congruent quadrilateral appearing on the globe, but the shape of the maps drawn on the trajectory of these trajectories is dissolved
 yathakritik prakshep : in prakshepon par khinche maanchitron kii akruti shuddh hoti he
 To keep the shape pure, the latitude and longitude lines need to be mutually perpendicular and at any one point the scale is the same in all directions
 parantu maapak ek bindu se duusare bindu par bhinn ho jaataa he
 In fact, it is not possible to keep the shape completely pure
 keval laghu kshetron main hi akruti lagbhag thik rah sakati he
 Especially at points, the full-form shape remains pure
 samaantarali prakshep : prakshepon par ankit maanchitron kii dishaaen shuddh hoti hai
 The directions around the map are the same as those on the earth
 yah centrebindu yadi koi dhruv he to deshaantar rekhaayen shuddh dishaaen pradarshit karti hai
 These interpolations are more commonly used by sailors
 vikashneey prishth ke aadhaar par kiya hua vibhaajan adhik pramanik mana jaataa he
 Under this, there are the following four groups of projections: globe ko shanku dwaara is prakaar dhankaa jaataa he ki shanku kisi ek akshansh par hi globe ko chaaron ore sparsh karata ho
 But it is not possible to touch the cone on the pole and equator, because these are odd conditions
 globe ko aavrutt karne ke uparaant kisi dhyutimaan bindu se prakaash daalkar akshansh deshaantar rekhaon kii chaaya shanku dharaatal par praapt kii jaati he
 By making these boards permanent, the cones are cut at any desired longitude and thus the line is obtained on the plane plane with the latitude lines arc and the longitude lines being the simple lines at the vertex of the cone
 jis akshansh par shanku globe ko sparsh karata he use "maanak akshansh' kehete hai
 The cone can also be touched on any other small circle
 parantu yadi shanku kaa sheersh dhruv ke dhur upar na rahe to akshansh rekhaayen chaap rup main nahin hongi or na deshaantar rekhaayen chaap rup main
 In addition to this geometric method, cone interpolations are also obtained in an unsymmetric manner
 belan dwaara globe ko is prakaar dhank diya jaataa he ki belan globe ko vishuvat rekha par chaaron ore sparsh karata ho
 Now the light line is illuminated by throwing light from a grating point
 taduparant belan ko kisi vishesh deshaantar par katkar khol liya jaataa he or is prakaar ek ytaakar rekhajaal samtal dharaatal par ban jaataa he
 Under this method, the center of the globe is considered to be the dimming point
 is prakaar praapt rekhajaal par deshaantar rekhaayen uttar se dakshin kii ore khinchi hui saral rekhaayen hoti hai jinaki lambaai vishuvat rekha ke baraabar hoti he
 In these projections, if the center of the globe is considered to be the point of divergence, the distance between the latitudinal lines increases simultaneously toward the poles
 belan ko vishuvat rekha par sparsh na karte hue anya kisi vruht vrutt par bhi sparsh karaayaa ja saktaa he, parantu is prakaar khinche hue rekhajaal main akshansh ore deshaantar rekhaayen vakr hongi
 In cylindrical precipitates, the pole is not visible, because the surface of the cylinder is parallel to the pole axis and the shadow of the pole falls elsewhere and does not fall on the surface of the cylinder
 in prakshepon main samtal dharaatal par hi pratibimb liya jaataa he
 It touches the ground globe at one point and in this state a light is obtained by lighting it from a dimming point
 dhyutimaan bindu ko sthiti par aadhaarit khamadhya prakshepon ke vibhinn naam nimnlikhit hai : In the methods of mean trajectories, if the plane surface is tangent to a pole, such projections are called polar axis interpolation; if the plane plane touches the globe at some point of the equator, such projections are called equatorial termed interpolation
 iske atirikt samtal dharaatal globe ko dhruv or vishuvat rekha ke madhya sthit kisi bindu par sparsh karata he to is prakaar ke prakshep tiryak khamadhya prakshep kehalaate hai
 The projections are also named based on the above mentioned position of the dead point such as centroid, perpendicular and oblique projection
 uparyukt vivaran se yah spasht hota he ki belanaakaar or khamadhya prakshep shanku prakshep ke hi visham rup hai
 If the cone is too long and can touch the large circle, then the cone will take the form of a cylinder
 iske atirikt shanku yadi bahut hi samtal ho jaay to globe ko keval ek bindu par hi sparsh karegaa
 At this stage, it will become silent projection
 upar likhe hue teenon samoohon ke prakshep jyamitiya evam ajyamitiya donon vidhiyon se khinche jate hai
 Ajyamitiya or non-random are interpolations, because they are drawn on the basis of the principle of mathematics and calculations without taking any reflection
 kisi vishesh uddeshy kii purti hetu hi aisa kiya jaataa he
 Although they are not easy to construct, they are used more than other types of trajectories, and these trajectories, in particular, map out the whole system

 naino vigyaan ne jivan ke har kshetra main apni ek gahari paith banaai he
 This mode of physics based on measurement and application of precision is not very new
 anuprayog ke rup main yah bahut pracheen he
 But researches in recent years have given a new direction to its study
 naino kitna bada hota he yaa kitna chota
 To know this, we start with the history of Nano
 aarambh se hi sookshm kaa adhyayan maanviya utsukata ke kendra main rahaa he
 a description of matter science and subtlety is found in our old texts
 lagbhag 3000 varsh purv rachit shwetashwataropanishad main brahmand ke sabase chote kan ke maap kaa varnan miltaa he
 Keshagrashatabhagasya shatansh: analogical
 jeevah sookshmswaroopousyan sankhyatito hi chitkanah
 
 yadi kesh ke agrabhag ko sau bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaae or prayek bhaag ko or sau bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaae, tab shesh bachaa hua bhaag brahmand kaa sookshmatisookshm bhaag hoga
 It is noteworthy that the measurement of the microscopic portion of the universe mentioned above is equivalent to nanotechnology
 naino vigyaan ke siddhant ke pratham anuprayog kaa shrey rome ko jaataa he
 The colorful glass cups made in Rome in the fourth century are still very attractive
 raganhin shishe ko vividh rango se susajjit karne ke liye sone or chaandi ke naino kanon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Kajal can be named as another ancient application of nano science
 saundarya or swasthya kaarnon se bahut pehle se kaajal kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Commonly use a traditional method to make mascara
 isamen sarso ke tel yaa ghi ke deepak ke upar kisi dhaatu ke paatr ko rakh kar banaate hai
 Nano tubes are abundant in carbon arising from incomplete combustion of oil
 is prakaar kul utpann carbon kaa lagbhag ek pratishat bhaag carbon naino kanon dwaara mil kar bana hota he
 Another example can be given of Japan's famous medieval samurai swords
 japan kii ati pracheen yuddh vidya main samurai talavaaron kaa ek vishisht sthaan he
 These swords are known for their sharp edge and strength
 in talavaaron ko banane main Forge and Fold takneekee kaa prayog karte the
 In this technique, the metal is first heated and beat and then thinned and folded
 aisa baar baar dohraane se bane dhaatu kii sataha bahut patali or majboot ho jaati he
 Another example can be given of the thin gold fibers used in Banarasi sarees
 yah reshe 10 micron tak motaai ke ho sakate hai
 Due to these gold fibers, the aura of Banarasi sari increases manifold
 naino ke in pracheen anuprayogon ko dekhne se yah gyaat hota he ki takneekee vikaas ke liye gahan vaigyanik gyaan kaa hona aavashyak nahin he
 It can also be learned from requirements, experiences and adaptations
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki hamane naino ko vaigyanik rup se abhi jaananaa aarambh kiya he lekin yah bhi satya he ki ham kahin bahut pehle se iskaa prayog karte aa rahe hai
 In recent years, due to the research and scientific development, we have only come to know its scientific reasons
 ab yahaan prashn yah uthta he ki naino vigyaan aaj itnaa charchit kyon he? yahaan tak kii hollywood ke nirmaataa bhi naino kii charchaa kar rahe hai or duusari ore udyogpati bhi naino car kii bot kar rahe hai
 This proves that we are very excited about nanotechnology and its applications
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki ham nagn ankho se 40-50 micron tak hi dekh sakate hai or yah saamaanya anubhav kii baat he ki ham jise dekh sakate hai usee kaa adhyayan bhi kar sakate hai
 By controlling what you can study, you can also use it for technical use
 naino ke vaigyanik adhyayan ko scaning prob sookshmdarshi kii khoj se ek nai disha mili
 He also received the 1985 Nobel Prize for scanning electron microscopes discovered in 1981 by Binigan Roerger
 vastav main is sookshmdarshi kaa avishkaar ek aitihaasik ghatana thi
 This research gave us a new vision which made it possible to study materials at the microscopic level
 yah dekha gaya he ki vibhinn kaarnon se sookshmata ke is str par adhyayan bahut aavashyak he
 There are several reasons for the potential use of nanotechnology
 sabase bada kaaran yah he ki naino aakaar main padaarth ke mul gun bahut badal jate hai
 There is also a noticeable change in color, reactivity, electrical properties etc
 yah parivartan chunki mul gunon se alag hote hai atah niyantrit sthiti main in parivartanon kaa upyog karke asaamaanya se lagane vaale anuprayogtmak vikaas bhi kiye ja sakate hai
 An example of a gold colloidal solution can be given
 sone ke saamaanya kanon kaa rang pilaa hota he lekin naino aakaar par iske laal or safed coloidi vilyan bhi banaae ja sakate hai
 In 1857, Michael Faraday produced a colloidal solution of gold
 sone ke naino aakaar ke kanon kaa yah vilyan kai maamalon main alag he

 Wiesel suggested the possibility of Vedic texts written at the end of the 1st millennium BCE
 kuch vidwaan jaise jaik goodi kehete hai ki "veda ek maukhik samaaj ke utpaada nahin hai", is drushtikon ko greek, srbija or anya samskritiyon jaise vibhinn maukhik samaajon se sahitya ke sancharit sanskarnon main visangatiyon kii tulana karke is drushtikon kaa aadhaar rakhte hue, us par dhyaan dete hue vaidic sahitya bahut susangat or vishaal he jise likhi bina, pidiyon main maukhik rup se bana diya gaya tha
 However, says Gowdy, Vedic texts are likely to be included in both a written and oral tradition, calling it "parallel products of a literacy society"

 There has been a tradition of study and interpretation of Vedas in India since ancient times
 vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm anusaar arshyug main brahma se lekarvedavyasathatha jaimini tak ke rishi-muniyon or darshanikaun ne shabd,pramaan ke rup main inhen ko maane hai or inke aadhaar par apane granthon kaa nirmaan bhi kiye hai
 Parashar, Katyayan, Yajnavalkya, Vyasa, Panini etc
 are called Vedavetta of ancient times
 vedon ke vidit hone yani chaar rishiyon ke dhyaan main aane ke baad inaki vyakhya karne kii parampara rahi he 
 Therefore, as a result only one Vedka form has been considered as four mantras, Brahmins, Aranyakas, Upanishads
 itihaspurana aadi mahan granth vedon kaa vyaakhyaanke swarupamen rache gaye
 In ancient times and medieval times, scriptures have been due to this interpretation and interpretation
 mukhya vishay - dev, agni, rudra, vishnu, marut, saraswati ityadi jaise shabdon ko lekar hue
 In the view of Vedavetta Maharishi Swami Dayanand Saraswati, knowledge, deeds, worship and science are subjects of the Vedas
 jeev, ishwar, prakruti in teen anadi nity sattaaon kaa nij swaroop kaa gyaan keval veda se hi uplabdh hota he

 Although in today's era we are creating a feeling of unity, unity and love in the whole world, but in the period when Britain ruled India, many myths arose from the translation of Vedas by some Anglo translators
 yah koi dosha nahin balki sonchi samajhi sajeesh thi
 His main task was to hollow out India and convert Hindus to Christians

 "but the historians of the same period proved that it is only a myth and there is not even a lot of truth in it and the ancestors of Hadappa Mohenjo Daro were also Aryans

 This omnipotent text of Vedic Age is also known as 'vedatrayi'
 pehle yah veda granth ek hi tha jiskaa naam yajurveda tha- ekaivasid yajurveda chaturdhah vyabhajat punah vahi yajurveda punah rik-yajus-saamah ke rup me prasiddh hua jisase vah 'trayee' kahalaaya | baad main veda ko padhanaa bahut kathin prathit hone laga, isliye usee ek veda ke teen yaa chaar vibhaag kiye gaye
 Then he came to be known as Vedatrayi in the form of Rigyajusam or Chaturveda as Rigyjusamatharva after a long time
 mantron kaa prakaar or aashay yani arth ke aadhaar par vargeekaran kiya gaya
 Its basis is as follows - vaidic parampara do prakaar ke he - brahm parampara or aditya parampara
 The Vedatrayi tradition of both traditions was famous in ancient times
 vishwa main shabd-prayog kii teen sheliyaan hoti he: padya, gadhy or gaan
 There are three such divisions 'verse, prose and song' of Vedas mantras - padya main akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam kaa nishchit niyam hota he
 Therefore, the noun of fixed letter-number and Ved-mantras with foot and punctuation is 'rik'
 jin mantron main chand ke niyamanusaar akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam rishidrisht nahin he, ve gadyatmak mantra 'yajuh' kehalaate hai or jitne mantra ganaatmak hai, ve mantra ‘'sam'’ kehalaate hai
 On the basis of these three types of word-publishing-styles, the word 'trilogy' is also used for Veda in scripture and folk
 yajurveda gadhysangrah he, at: is yajurveda main jo rugveda ke chandobaddh mantra hai, unako bhi yajurveda padhane ke samay gadhy jaisaa hi padhaa jaataa he
 The said four divisions of the Vedas were not separate before the end of Dwaparyuga
 us samay to rik, yajuh or sam - in teen shabd-shaileonme sangrahatmak ek vishisht adhyayaneey shabd-raashi hi veda kehalaati thi
 Atharva also became attached to Veda's counterpart after that, then in place of 'trilogy' he started being called 'chaturveda'
 When the Guru was angry, Yajnavalkya, who received all the Vedas from Aditya, said in his memory after Vedatrayi and in front of Puranas, including Atharva, Veda s Tharvapuranani eti
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar hai- lekin pehle ye ek hi the
 In the present tense, the Vedas are considered four
 parantu in chaaron ko milakar ek hi 'veda granth' samajha jaataa tha
 Significantly, despite the trilogy, the Veda was one, then it was divided into four parts
 sunne se failane or peedi-dar-peedi yaad rakhane ke kaaran vaa srishtikarta brahmaji bhi apaurushey vanike rupame praapt karne ke kaaran shruti, swatah pramaan ke kaaran amnaay, purush bhinn ishvarkrut hone se apaurushey ityadi naam vedon ke hai
 Hearing and remembering Gurmukh in the order of reading and reciting the Veda is of great importance in terms of the preservation and success of the Veda
 isi kaaran veda ko ‘'shruti'’ bhi kehete hai
 The Veda is conserved through diligent practice, hence the name "amnaya"
 vedon kii raksharth maharishiyon ne asht vikrutiyonki rachana kii he -jataa maala shikha rekha dhwajo dando ratho ghanah | ashtau vikrutyah prokto krampurva maharaayah || jiske falswarup pracheen kalke tarah aaj bhi hrasv, deergh,plutt or udaatt,anudaatt swarit adike anurup mantroccharan hota he
 Accordingly, the classification of the Vedic word-zodiac of each branch - each Veda mentioned above has four parts
 pehle bhaag mantrabhag ke alaava anya teen bhagako veda na maanane vaale bhi hai lekin aisa vichaar tarkpurna siddh hote nahin dekha gaya hai
 In the eternal Vedic tradition, mantra, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishad are the four components of the same Veda
 kul milakar vedake bhaag ye hai :- Despite the above four sections being Vedas, some people consider only 'samhita' as Vedas
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke samay shrikrishnadwaipayan vedavyas ji ne yagyanushthan ke upyog ko drushtigat rakhkar us ek veda ke chaar vibhaag kar diye or in chaaron vibhaagon kii shiksha chaar shishyon ko di
 These four divisions are famous as Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 pel, vaishampayan, jaimini or sumantu naamak -chaar shishyon ko kramshah rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda kii shiksha di
 These four disciples taught Shakal etc
 to their different disciples
 in shishyon ke dwaara apane-apane adheen vedon ke prachaar va sangrakshan ke kaaran ve vaidic granth,charan ,shakha, pratishakha or anushaakha ke madhyam se bahut rupame vistaarit hogaye | unheen prachaarak rishiyon ke naam se prasiddh hai
 The aforementioned four disciples started as many disciples as they were called Charanasamuh
 Each stage has many branches in us
 or isi tarah pratishakha,anushaakha aadi ban gaye
 Several branches of the Vedas, that is, the method of lecture, have been described
 rishi patanjali ke mahabhashya ke anusaar rugveda kii 21, yajurveda kii 101, samaveda kii 1001, arthvveda kii 9 is prakaar 1131 shakhaaen hai parantu aaj 12 shakhaaen hi mul granthon main uplabdh hai
 The Vedic words of each branch of the Veda are available in four parts: 1
 Samhita 2
 Brahmin 3
 Aranyaka 4
 Upanishads
 kuch log inamen samhita ko hi veda maanate hai
 The remaining three parts are considered as the interpretation texts of the Vedas
 alag shakhaon main mul samhita to vahi rahati hai lekin aaranyak or brahman granthon main antar aa jaataa he
 Upanishad is also found in many mantras, as in the Shuklayujurveda mantrabhag, the Isavasopanishad
 In the old times, there were as many branches as there were mantras, Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads
 Babajud of such branches is also found in texts of only 9 branches today
 anya shakhaonme kisiike mantra,kisiike brahman,kisiike aaranyak or kisiike upanishad hi paaya jaataa he
 Not only this, even more branches are found in Upanishads, only then more Upanishads are found

 parantu aajkal teen hi prachlit hai - kothumiya, jaimineey or ranyneey
 It is divided into anterior and posterior

 There are a total of 640 mantras in all the four scandals

 kuch log isamen mantra-tantra bhi khojate hai
 While this Veda preaches Brahm Gyan, it also explains the way of salvation
 ise brahm veda bhi kehete hai
 It is also called Atharva Angiras mainly due to the mantras of Rishis and Atharvan
 yah 20 kandon main vibhakt he
 There are many sutras in each kand and there are mantras in sutras
 is veda main kul 5977 mantra hai
 Its two branches Shaunik and Piplad are available today
 atharvaveda kaa vidvan chaaron vedon kaa gyaata hota he
 In the Yajna, the Rigveda calls for the Gods, the Samaveda is the origin of the Samaja, the Yajurveda's Adhvaryu Dev: finishes the coterm and the Atharvaveda's Brahma controls the entire Yagya Karma
 ayurveda, dhanurveda, gandharvaveda tathaa sthapatyaved- ye kramshah chaaron vedon ke upved katyayan ne batalaaye hai
 For all round practice of Vedas, there are texts of education, kalpa, grammar, nirukta, chhanda and astrology which are called 6 parts
 pratipadsutra, anupad, chandobhasha, dharamshastra, nyaay tathaa vaisheshik- ye 6 darshana upang granth bhi uplabdh he
 The topics of appendages are as follows - veda kii samhitaon main mantraksharon main khadi tathaa aadi rekhaayen lagaakar unke ucch, madhyam, yaa mand sangitamay swar uccharan karne ke sanket kiye gayi hai
 They are named as the sublime, Anudatta and Swarit
 ye swar bahut pracheen samay se prachlit hai or mahamuni patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main inke mukhya mukhya niyamon kaa samavesh kiya he
 Vowels are spoken more or less as they also have two distinctions
 jaise udaatt-udaattatar, anudaatt-anudaattatar, swarit-swaritodatt
 Apart from these, there is considered to be another vowel - Shruti - the three vowels merge in it
 is prakaar kul swaron kii sankhya 7 ho jaati he
 Even in these seven vowels, there is a distinction between the vowels for which there is some change in the vowels
 yadhyapi in swaron ke ankan or tankan main kai vidhiyaan prayog kii jaati hai or prakaashak-bhashyakaron main koi ek vidha saamaanya nahin he, adhikansh sthanon par anudaatt ke liye akshar ke neeche ek aadi lakeer tathaa swarit ke liye akshar ke upar ek khadi rekha banane kaa niyam he
 Sublime has no sign of its own
 isse ankan main samasya aane se kai lekhak-prakaashak swar chihnon kaa prayog hi nahin karte
 There are many types of verses used in Vedic mantras, the main ones are- iske anusaar vedokt yagyon kaa anushthan hi veda ke shabdon kaa mukhya upyog mana gaya he
 From the beginning of the creation, there has generally been a diversity in the style, chanting and rituals of chanting
 is vividhta ke kaaran hi vedon kii shakhaon kaa vistaar hua he
 There are 21 branches of Rigveda, 101 branches of Yajurveda, 1000 branches of Samaveda and 9 branches of Atharva Veda - thus there are a total of 1,131 branches
 is sankhya kaa ullekh maharishi patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main bhi kiya he
 Out of the above 1,131 branches, currently only 12 branches are available in the original texts: - uparyukt 12 shakhaon main se keval 6 shakhaon kii adhyayan-style praapt he-shakal, taittareey, madhyandini, kaanv, kauthum tathaa shaunak shakha
 It would also not be inappropriate to say that some other texts of other branches are available, but they cannot get full introduction of the branch and the names of many branches are also not available
 jaisaa ki upar likhaa he, vedon ke kai shabdon kaa samajhnaa utana saral nahin rahaa he
 In order to understand the real meaning of Vedanka, Vedangauka was invented from within
 Because of this, the meanings described in them cannot be known
 Most of the controversies have been about the nature of God, that is, the one or the like of many gods
 vedonke vaastavik arth vahi kar saktaa he jovedang- shiksha,kalp, vyakaran, nirukt,chand or jyotishka gyaata he
 The interpretation of Sanskrit scholars of Europe has also been inspired by the theory of indo-aryan caste
 pracheen kaal main hi inaki satta ko chunauti dekar kai aise mat prakat hue jo aaj bhi dharmik mat kehalaate hai lekin kai roopon main bhinn hai
 Their main differences are explained below
 uname se jiskaa apana avichhinn paramparase veda,shakha,or kalpasutron se nirdeshit hokar ek adwitiya brahmatatvako iswar maanakar kisi ek devvadame na ulajhakar vedavadame raman karte hai ve vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm mananevaale he ve hi vedonko sarvopari maanate he
 Apart from this, some cults who have different views and consider different gods are: jin vishyon par vivaad rahaa he unka varnan neeche diya he
 Yajna: There is a contradiction in many scholars, opinions and commentators regarding the importance of the present form of Yajna
 yajna main aag ke prayog ko pracheen parsi pujan vidhi ke itnaa samaan hona or havan kii atyadhik mahatta ke prati vidwaanon main ruchi rahi he
 Deity: There has been disagreement among many scholars about the word Dev
 vedokt nirgun- niraakaar or sagun- saakaar me se antim pakshako maanane vaale kai maton main ise mahamanushya ke rup main vishisht shakti praapt saakaar charitra masajhate hai or unka murti rup main pujan karte hai to anya kai inhen ishwar ke hi naam bataate hai
 Philanthropic things, learned people and guiding mantras have been called devas
 udaahranarth agni shabd kaa arth aag na samajhakar sabase aage yani pratham yani parameshwar samajhate hai
 The meaning of the deity Shavad is considered divine, that is, full of the power of God - like earth etc
 isi mat main mahadev, devon ke adhipati hone ke kaaran ishwar ko kehete hai
 Similarly, due to the universal God Vishnu and truth everywhere, it is called Brahma
 is prakaar brahma, vishnu or mahadev kisi charitra ke naam nahin balki ishwar ke hi naam he
 Vedic and temporal words are used to determine the meaning of grammar and nirukta
 iske abhavame arthke anarth kar baithte he
 Similarly, Ganesh, Prajapati, Devi, Buddha, Lakshmi etc
 are the names of God
 vedadi shastronme aae vibhann ek hi parameshwarake he
 As has been said in the Upanishads - Eko Dev Sarvabhuteshu Gudha: Omnipresent Sarvabandhatra Some people quarrel in the nature of God
 inmese koi murtipuja karte he or koi aise log he jo murtipuja ke viruddh hai or ishwar ko ekmaatr satya, sarvopari samajhate hai
 Ashwamedha: From Ashwamedha comes the idea of violence and sacrifice
 yah kai hinduon ko bhi ascharyajanak lagata he kyonki kai sthanon par shuddhtavaadi hinsa se parhez karte rahe hai
 Many believe that Advaram is also used in the word Medha, which means non-violence
 atah medh kaa bhi arth kuch or rahaa hoga
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Ashwa must have been power rather than horse
 shriram sharma acharya krit bhaashayon ke anusaar ashv shabd kaa arth shakti, gau shabd kaa arth poshan he
 With this, the meaning of Ashwamedha seems to be different from horse sacrifice
 som:kuch log ise sharaab maanate hai lekin kai anuwaadon ke anusaar ise kuta-piskar banaaya jaataa tha
 Therefore, it does not look like a drink

 Located on the western coast of India, Mumbai is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra

 richard mathew stollman, jinhen aksar rms bhi kaha jaataa hai, duniya ke jane maane mukt software kaaryakarta evam computer programmer hai
 He is the founder of GNU, besides he also created the Free Software Foundation
 dostollman ne jienyu compiler collection or GNU EMACS bhi viksit kiye hai
 Dr
 Stolman is considered the father of the GNU Public License
 1983 main, dow stollman ne jienyu pariyojna kii sruvaat kii thi
 The goal of the GNU project was to create a Unix-like operating system made entirely of open source
 isi ke saath unhone mukt software andolan kii bhi sruvaat kii
 Stollman has been a key producer and coordinator of the GNU project and has developed parts of the GNU software such as the GNU Compiler Collection, the GNU Debugger, and the GNU Emax Text Editor
 unhone 1985 main mukt software foundation kii sthapana kii thi
 From the mid-90s, Stallman spends most of his time advocating for free software and agitating against software patents, digital rights, and other technical legal systems that take away their freedom from users
 iname software license agreements, non disclozar agreement, acteveshan kees, donglls, copy restriction, proprietary formats or bina sorce code ke binary executables bhi shaamil hai
 It was Dr
 Stallman who put the idea of copyleft in front of the people, using the same principles of copyright, allowing the user to use the software, modify its source code, and distribute that software and its source code
 
 2012 tak inhe 14 anareri doctoret or professorships mili hai
 Stolman was born in 1953 in New York City
 stollman kii mata kaa naam elis lippman, vah peshey se skool shikshika thi, stollman ke pita danniel stollman printing press brokar the
 From childhood, Stallman was very interested in computers
 jab stollman ek pre - tin samar camp main the tab unhone IBM 7094 ke manuels padhe the
 Between 1967 and 1969, Stallman attended a Saturday program for Columbia University high school students
 1967 se 1969 ke bich stollman colombia uniwarsity ke hai skool students ke liye chalaaye jane vaale shanivaar ke program main jate the
 Stolman also served as a Voluntary Laboratory Assistant in the Biology Department at Rockefeller University
 unki ruchi ganit evam physics kii taraf zyaada thi lekin rockfilor uniwarsity main unke shikshak ke anusaar ve achche biologist bhi ban sakate the
 His first experience with computers was at IBM New York Scientific Center when he was in high school
 hai skool ke senior year ke baad unhen 1970 ke greeshm kaal ke liye liya gaya tha taaki vah Fortran language istemaal karke ek newmerical analysis kaa program likhe
 He finished the job in a few weeks, and the rest of the time he wrote a text editor program using the APL language and a preprocessor program using the PL / 1 programming language for which he used an IBM System / 360 machine
 harvard vishvavidhyalay ke first year main, stollman ko unke MATH55 main majboot pradarshan ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 By 1971, by the end of his first year, he had become a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
 ve haikar community main bhi jane jate the vahaan unhen RMS naam se janaa jaataa tha 
 In 1974, he graduated in Physics from Harvard
 apane grajuation ke baad stollman ne mitgrejueta student ke taur pe jwine join kiya
 He gave up his desire to do his doctorate in physics, after a year, he wanted to concentrate on programming in MIT AI LABORATORY
 1975 main ve MIT main gerri sussamen ke neeche research associat ke taur par kaam kar rahe the
 At that time Stollman published a research paper with Susman, this paper was on AI Truth Maintenance
 iskaa sheershak dependency directed backtracking tha
 This paper was an early work in intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems
 2003 tak stollman or sussamen dwaara die gaye takanic ko sabase shaktishaalee intelligent backtracking kaa tarika mana jaataa hai
 While working as a hacker at mit's AI Laboratory, Stollman worked on some software projects such as TECO, EMACS for ITS and LISP machine operating systems
 ve leboratory main computer ke simit uplabdhta ke kade aalochak the, us samay leboratory kii funding dephence advanced research project agency se hoti thi
 When mit's Laboratory for Computer Science installed the password control system in 1977, Stallman figured out a way to decrypt the password
 stollman ne sabhi yugeras ko mail bheja jisame unka dicript kiya hua password tha or is mail main unhone yugeras ko apana password badal kar nal string karne kaa suzav diya taaki computer system main phir se anonemas acces suru ho
 About 20% of the users followed him, but in the end the password system remained intact
 kai saal baad stollman ne apane is andolan ko safal bataaya
 At the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s, the hacker culture that Stallman lived in began to crumble
 software ko pratidwandiyon ke computaron par chalane se rokane ke liye companiyon ne sorce code dena band kar diya or copirite evam restrictive software licensos kaa istemaal karnaa suru kar diya taaki software ko copy yaa distribute karnaa simit yaa band kiya ja sake
 Such proprietary software existed before, and it was becoming clear that all software in the future would be proprietary software
 stollman ke MIT ke mitra brooster kahel ke anusaar software ke kanoonee charitra main yah badlaav US copirite act of 1976 ke kaaran hua tha
 When Brian Raid introduced software time bombs to control unlicensed access to the scribe markup language and word processing system, Stallman rated it a "crime against humanity"
 kai varsho baad stollman ne yah safai di kii yujar ke swatantraaa ko rokane vaale karm ko ve aparaadh maanate hai, software ke liye paise lene ko nahin
 In 1980 Stallman and a few other hackers were not allowed to access the source code of the software for the new XEROX 9700 laser printer installed in AI Lab, with Stollman slightly altering the source code of its earlier laser printers
 is parivartan se yah hua tha kii printer driver printing job ke hone par log in kiye hue yujar ko yah massej bhejtaa tha kii "unka job ho chukaa hai " or agar printer main paper jam ho jaataa to yah software sab log in kiye hue yugeras ko isaki jaankaree dete ek massej bhejtaa tha
 It was not possible to add these features to this new printer, which caused a lot of problems for most of the users as the printer was on a different floor than most users
 is anubhav ke baad stollman nishchit ho gaye kii yugeras ko software main koi bhi parivartan karne kii azaadi honi chahie
 Richard Greenblatt was also a hacker in the AI lab and started Lisp Machines, Inc
 to sell Lisp machines
 yah Lisp mashine unhone or tom nite ne AI lab main dizine kiya tha
 Greenblatt had refused to seek external funding
 unka yah maananaa tha kii kuch mashin banaakar bechney se jo munafa hoga use company main phir se nivesh kar company ko or bada kiya ja sakegaa
 In contrast, other hackers thought that the venture capital approach would be better
 kisi agreement par naa pahuchane par vah havers jo venture fundad rasta lenaa chaahate the unhone saath main milakar Symbolics kii sruvaat kii ras noftskar kii madad se jo AI lab main administrator the
 Symbolics recruited all the other hackers, including well-known hacker Bill Gossaper, who left the AI lab
 cimbolics ne MIT ke policys kaa hawala dete hue greenblot ko istipha dene par majaboor kiya
 Both companies made proprietary software, with Stollman believing that LMI did not harm the lab community compared to Symbolics
 1982 se 1983 ke ant tak stollman cimbolics ke programmers ke output ko clon karne kaa kaam kiya karte the taaki cimbolics ko lab ke computaron par ekadhikaar karne se roka ja sake
 According to Stolman, software users should have the freedom to share software, along with that users should have the freedom to study and distribute the software's source code
 unke anusaar swatantraaa samaaj evam yugeras ke liye zaruri hai or yah ek naitik mulya hai
 Stallman quit his MIT job in February 1984 so that he could devote all his time to the GNU project, which he had scouted in September 1983
 sitambar 1983 main stollman ne GNU oparating system ke yojana kii ghosna kai ARPANET meling lists or USENET main kii thi
 Stollman had initiated the project himself, stating that "being an operating system developer i had the right skills for this task
 main yah maanakar to nahin chal saktaa tha kii is kaary main mujhe safalataa milegi, lekin mujhe aisa laga kii mujhe is kaam ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 i decided to make my system compatible with UNIX, so that it is portable and UNIX users can easily adopt it
 " In 1985 Stollman released the GNU Manifesto
 isamen unhone apane GNU naamak free oparating system banane kii ruparekha likhi thi
 It was supposed to be compatible with the GNU operating system UNIX
 yah naam GNU ek ricorsive echronim hai iskaa phul form "GNU is note UNIX" hai
 Soon after, he founded a non-profit organization called Free Software Foundation
 iskaa uddeshy software programmers niyukt karnaa tha or free software movement ko ek kanoonee rup se buniyadi dhaancha uplabdh karwaanaa tha
 Stollman is the chairman of the FSF without pay
 FSF ek 501 nonprofit sanstha hai masachusets main
 Stollman popularized the idea of copyleft
 copileft ek kanoonee kriyavidhi hai jo free software main badlaav or vitaran ke adhikaron ko niyantrit karti hai
 It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License
 1989 main pehla program mukt GNU general public license jari hua tha
 By then, a lot of the GNU system was ready
 stollman ne kai zaruri software tuls banaaye the, iname text editor ,compiler ,dibgar or ek bild automator shaamil hai
 The component that was left was the colonel
 1990 main GNU ke kuch memberon ne carnaji melone ke maa microkarnal ko GNU hard project main istemaal karnaa suru kiya, hard abhi bhi puri tarah se taiyaar nahin hai
 In 1991, Linus Trovalds created an open source monolithic Linux kernel with the help of gnu's development tools
 trowalds ne ne yah karnal free software license ke tahat release kar diya
 The GNU system and the Linux kernel were created together to create a new free operating system that we know as GNU / LINUX
 lekin aam chalan main GNU / LINUX ko linaks hi kaha jaataa hai
 It is unfair to call this operating system just Linux because it is the GNU system in which Linux kernels are used
 haikar culture main stollman ne POSIX naam or Emacs editor ko prabhavit kiya hai
 The popularity of Emacs in UNIX systems gave a tough competition to vi
 isse editor war suru ho gaya
 Stollman used to say that he considered himself st
ignucius of the Church of Emacs and said "vivivi is the editor of Satan" while "using the free version of vi is not penance"
 1992 main Lucid Inc jo apane khud kaa Emacs bana rahe the, unka stollman ke saath vivaad hua, aakhir main unhone apane software ko xemacs ke rup main fork kiya
 Stollman has written several essays on free software
 ve 1990 ke dasak se hi free software movement ke liye andolan karte rahe hai
 His given title is titled The GNU Project and Free Software Movement, Dangers of Software Patents and Copyright and Society in the Age of Computer Networks
 2006 or 2007 jab 18 mahino tak public kansalatesan chal rahaa tha GNU general public license varshan 3 ko draft karne ke liye, us samay unhone ek chauthaa shirsak jod diya jo prastaavit badlaavon ko vistaar se samajhaati thi
 Stallman's strong advocacy of free software inspired developers to create Virtual Richard m Stallman software
 yah software dibian GNU / LINUX system ke haal ke packages kaa vishleshan karata hai or un packejon ko report karata hai jo saath main non -free tree ban rahe ho
 Stollman does not agree with Debian's definition of free software
 1999 main stollman ne inacychlopedia banane kii baat kii thi jisame log articals banaaenge
 This led to gnupedia, which was later retired to Wikipedia, an emerging free online encyclopedia and Wikipedia was more successful
 stollman puri duniya main safar karte hai or ve free software or GNU project par bhasana dene kam se kam 65 deshon main gaye hai
 Stollman claims that there are many similarities between the Free Software movement and the movement of Mahatma Gandhi
 stollman ne kai baar GNU / LINUX naam ke liye vyavhaar karne kaa aagrah kiya hai us oparating system ke liye jo GNU system or linaks karnal ko saath main jod kar banaaya gaya hai
 Stollman considers this operating system a variant of GNU and tells GNU, the main developer of this operating system
 unke anusaar is software ko ko keval maatr linaks kehane se GNU project kaa darshan or is software ke bich kaa sampark tut jaataa hai
 From the beginning of 2003, they started using the name GNU + Linux so that no one could call it GNU / LINUX or GNU LINUX
 It may be that people mistakenly think that Linux kernels are maintained by GNU project
 stollman julian asanje or edward snowden jaise vishlablowers ke prashanshak hai
 Stolman has pleaded in his email signature after Snowden exposed the PRISM scandal
 yah mail kai meling lists main uplabdh hai
 : iskaa hindi anuwaad is prakaar hai
 Stollman spent much of his life in the political and software movement
 ve maanate hai ki dhan kii bahut kam parvaah karte hai
 Stallman says- "I have always lived in simplicity xxrep 4 
 like a student and i like it because don't do it like money tells me, don't do it"
 1998 tak MIT kaa AI lab jo unka offis tha unka ghar bhi hua karata tha
 He was registered to vote from there
 abhi ve cambridge main ek alag ghar main rahete hai jo MIT se zyaada dur nahin hai
 He does not get any salary for the post of his Research Affiliate in MIT
 1999 main unhone likhaa tha " ek naastik hone ke naate main kisi dharmik guru ko nahin maanata, lekin kabhi kabhi un main se kisi ke bole hue acchhee baat kii prashansa karata hoon"
 Stollman sometimes wears a button that reads "impeach god"
 jab stollman ko poocha gaya ke ve yahudee hai yaa nahin ? tab unka jawaab tha kii be naastik hai lekin yahudee mul ke
 Stollman does not consider Christmas, they celebrate "grav-mass" on 25 December
 yah naam or din sar isac newton par rakhi gayi hai, unka janam puraane calendar ke anusaar 25 disambar ko hua tha
 When asked who they were influenced by, the answer was Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, Ralph Nadar and Dennis Kusiniyech and with it said - "I am Franklin D
 Rosswalt And I'm also a fan of Winston Churchill, though i criticize some of his work "

 clice yaa ghisa-pita yaa pishtokti ek aisa vaakya, vichaar, yaa kala kaa tatv hota he jo bahut adhik prayog hone kii vajah se apana mul arth kho chukaa hua
 Often these are things that are considered very meaningful, new or delicate in the beginning
 udahaaran ke liye ek premi kaa apni premika se kahana ke "mai tumhaare liye taare tod laaounga" kisi jamaane main bahut arth rakhata tha lekin ab ek clishe banakar arthhin ho chukaa he
 Similarly, in Indian politics, "our aim is to help the poor" has become a slogan
 kala main aise tatwon kaa istemaal karnaa nausikhiye yaa madhyam-stareey hone kii nishaani mana jaataa he
 It is not necessary that the use of the cliche always shows lumps or slyness - it can also be used with truth and honesty
 lekin sunne yaa dekhne vaale ke liye ghisi-pity chiz main aashcharya yaa bhavukta nahin utpann hoti
 For example, the sentence of "I am going to be the mother of your child" in a film has become a subject of ridicule even if it is told truthfully
 "ghise-pite" ko angrezi main "clice" kaha jaataa he, jo francisi se liya gaya shabd he
 But it is believed that this word is not originally from any language
 jab kaagaz par press kii chapai nayi-nayi armbh hui thi to ek plate par mudraksharon ko ek-ek kar ke jodne se vaakya banaae jate the jinase phir hazaron pannon par chapai kii jaati thi
 In making such sentences with iron letters there was a sound similar to "klishe"
 is vajah se kala or sahitya kii duniya main jo chiz hazaron baar thok main prayog ho use 'clishe' kaha jane laga
 Keep in mind that from the grammatical point of view "ghisa-pita" is an adjective and never a noun
 iske vipareet "clishe" ek visheshan bhi ho saktaa he or ek sangya bhi
 "this sentence is a cliche" is the correct use
 "yah vaakya ek clishe vaakya he" bhi sahi he

 The Ryukyu people did not have any military force, so their king Sho Nei ordered everyone to surrender to the attackers in order to save their subjects 
 iske baad ek ajeeb sa aitihaasik daur rahaa jisamen rayucu chini samraat or japani shogan donon ko kar dene laga taaki ve donon hi inhen chaiyn se jeene den

 At the time when there were new ideas about the religion of Lord Mahavira and Buddha in India, a reformer was born in China, named Confucius
 us samay china main jhou rajvansh kaa basant or sharad kaal chal rahaa tha
 Over time, the power of the Zhou dynasty had become weak, many states were established in China, which always fought among themselves, which came to be called the era of quarreling states
 atah china kii praja bahut hi ksht jhel rahi thi
 At such a time, Mahatma Confucius emerged to teach morality lessons to the people of China
 inkaa janm isa messiah ke janm se kareeb 550 varsh pehle china ke shandong pradesh main hua tha
 His father died in childhood
 unke gyaan kii aakanksha aseem thi
 They had to acquire knowledge by suffering a lot
 17 varsh kii umr main unhen ek sarkari naukari mili
 After a few years, he left the government job and started teaching
 ghar main hi ek vidhyalay kholkar unhone vidhyaarthiyon ko shiksha dena prarambh kiya
 He used to teach students history, poetry and ethics orally
 unhone kavy, itihaas, sangeet or nitishastra par kai pustakon kii rachana kii
 He was the ruler of a city in Lu State at the age of 53 and later he was appointed as a minister
 mantri hone ke naate inhone dand ke badale manushya ke charitra sudhaar par bal diya
 Confucius gave the message of truth, love and justice to his disciples
 ve sadachaar par adhik bal dete the
 He used to inspire people to become humble, benevolent, virtuous and characterful
 They used to ask elders and ancestors to respect them
 He used to say don't treat others like you don't want to do with yourself
 kanceyucious ek sudhaarak the, dharm prachaarak nahin
 He did not give any teachings about God, but still later people started considering him as a religious teacher
 inaki mrityu 480 i
 pus
 main ho gai thi
 Confucian social reformers preached a stability in Chinese society
 kanceyucious kaa darshan shaastra aaj bhi chini shiksha ke liye path pradarshak bana hua he
 The Confucians never thought it necessary to give their ideas in writing
 uskaa mat tha ki vah vichaaron kaa vaahak ho saktaa he, unka srashta nahin
 He was a worshiper of archeology, because he thought that only through this can real knowledge be gained
 uskaa kahana tha ki manushya ko uske samast kaaryakalapon ke liye niyam apane andar hi praapt ho sakate hai
 Not only for the individual, but the rules and patterns of improvement and correct development of the whole society can be found in the words and work of the ancient Mahatmas
 kanfushas ne koi aisa lekh nahin choda jisamen uske dwaara pratipaadit naitik evam saamaajik vyavastha ke siddhanton kaa nirupan ho

 'basant or patjhad' naamak ek granth, jise lu kaa itivrutt bhi kehete hai, kanfushas kaa likhaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 This entire work is well received and although very small, it is considered ideal for brief histories of China

 ve uske aasapaas shraddhapurvak uthte-baithte the or uske aacharan kii sookshm visheshtaon par dhyaan diya karte the tathaa uske mukh se nikali vaani ke prayek shabd ko hridyangam kar lete or usapar manan karte the
 He used to study ancient history, poetry and social practices of the country from him
 kanfushas kaa kahana tha ki kisi desh main acha shashan or shanti tabhi sthapit ho sakati he jab shaasha, mantri tathaa janata kaa prayek vyakti apane sthaan par uchit kartavyon kaa paalan karata rahe
 The ruler should be the ruler in the true sense, the minister should be the minister in the true sense
 kanfushas se ek baar poocha gaya ki yadi use kisi pradesh ke shashansutra ke sanchaalan kaa bhaar saunpa jaae to vah sabase pehla koun sa mahatvapurn kaary karegaa
 His answer for this was - 'improvement of Names'
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo jis naam ke pad par pratishthit ho use us pad se sanlagn sabhi kartavyon kaa vidhiwat paalan karnaa chahie jisase uskaa vah naam sarthak ho
 He had full faith in the power of example and ideal
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki adarsh vyakti apane sadacharan se jo udhaaharan prastut karte hai, aam janata unke saamne nishchay hi jhuk jaati he
