 Vedic Sanskrit was a indo-aryan language spoken from 2000 BCE to 600 BCE
 yah sanskrit kii purvaj bhashaa thi or aadim hind-irani bhashaa kii bahut hi nikat kii santan thi
 At that time, the division of Persian and Sanskrit was very new, so the Vedic Sanskrit and Avastai languages are very close to each other
 vaidic sanskrit hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar kii hind-irani bhashaa shakha kii sab se pracheen pramanit bhashaa he
 The ancient Vedic scriptures of Hindus are written in Vedic Sanskrit
 bhartiya upmahadweep main shrout jaise sakht niyamit dhvaniyon vaale mantroccharan kii hazaron varshon puraani parampara ke kaaran vaidic sanskrit ke shabd or uccharan is kshetra main likhaai armbh hone se bahut pehle se surakshit hai
 It is seen from the study of Vedas that Vedic Sanskrit also changed in the span of hundreds of years
 rugveda kii vaidic sanskrit, jise rigvaidic sanskrit kaha jaataa he, sab se pracheen rup he
 There is a lot of difference between classical Sanskrit and Vedic Sanskrit after the regularization of Panini, therefore learning Sanskrit to read Vedas in original form is not only sufficient but it also teaches learning Vedic Sanskrit
 avastai farsi seekhney vaale vidwaanon ko bhi vaidic sanskrit seekhni padati he kyonki avasti granth kam bache hai or vaidic seekhney se us bhashaa kaa bhi adhik vistrut bodh mil jaataa he
 a variety of distinctions of secular Sanskrit literature from Vedic literature is found
 vaidic sahitya shuddhtah dharmikahai tathaa isamen sabhi loukik tattvon kaa beej samahit he
 Cosmic Sanskrit literature is predominantly religious-secular or in religion it can be said to be related to the public world
 is sahitya main mahakavy, puraana evam anya kavy naatak, alankarishastra, darshan, sutara, vidhi athwa niyam, kala, vaastushastra, aushadhi, ganit, mashin, udyog sambandhi granth or anya vibhinn vidyaon kii shakhaaen bhi praapt hoti hai
 There is also a difference between the language of cosmic literature and the language of Vedic literature
 donon ke shabdarup tathaa dhaaturup anek prakaar se bhinn hai
 The forms of Vedic Sanskrit are not only different but also many, especially those forms which are related to the forms of verb forms and metals
 is sambandh main donon saahitiyon kii kuch mahatvapurn bhinnataayen nimnlikhit hai: From the perspective of word form - for example, in cosmic Sanskrit, only such forms as Deva: Janaah
 jabaki vaidic sanskrit main inamen rup 'devasah', 'janaamah' bhi banate hai
 Similarly, the form ‘vishwani’ in the first and second divination plurals also becomes ‘vishva’ in Vedic literature
 tritiy bahuvachan main vaidic sanskrit main ‘devai’ is rup ke saath-saath ‘devebhih’ bhi miltaa he
 Similarly 'vyomni' or 'vyomani' these forms in the Saptami Vibhakti singular, as well as 'vyomn' in Vedic Sanskrit
 vaidic tathaa loukik sanskrit main kriyaroopon or dhaaturupon main bhi vishesh antar he
 Vedic Sanskrit is a bit more prosperous in this subject and has some other forms of achievement, whereas in the proverbial Sanskrit, there are only two such lakaras that state the position of the verbs: Lot and Vidhilinga joks are made from the metal of the present tense
 udaahranarth path se pathtu or pathet ye donon banate hai
 In Vedic Sanskrit, there are two more lakaras denoting the state of verbs: Ltkar and injunctive lilacar The laksa of these four stages are not only formed by latta nature in Vedic Sanskrit, but also from litt prakriti and luna prakriti
 is prakaar vaidic sanskrit main dhaaturup atyadhik maatra main hai
 Apart from this, the link suffixes are found in Vedic Sanskrit like Minimasi is also used, but in Cosmic Sanskrit 'minimahi' is used
 jahaan tak dhaatu se bane hue anya roopon kaa prashn he, loukik sanskrit main keval ek hi ‘tumun’ miltaa he jabaki vaidic sanskrit main iske lagbhag ek darjan rup milte hai jaise gantvai, gamdhyai, jeevasai, daatvai ityadi
 Post-scriptural Sanskrit has become more and more artificial or compositional, and we find examples of it in the horrifying passages used in the prose of Sambandhu and Banabhatta
 is kala main vah apane kshetra ke anya gadhyakaron se atyant utkrisht hai
 Some Vedic words are inaccessible in cosmic Sanskrit and some new words have also emerged
 udaahranarth, vaidic shabd ‘aps’ kaa ‘kaary’ ke arth main prayog loukik sanskrit main lupt ho gaya he
 The word 'family' used in secular Sanskrit is unavailable in Vedic Sanskrit
 yah vaidic evam loukik sanskrit kii apni visheshta he
 From the point of view of semantics, there has been a specific change in some words like 'ritu' which means 'shakti' in Vedic Sanskrit and it has become 'yajna' in Cosmic Sanskrit
 vaidic sanskrit main 'fa' or 'kh' kii dhvaniyaan thim jo baad kii sanskrit main khoi gai
 Note the pronunciation of 'kh' in it as it is very different from 'kh', and is found in words like 'bad' and 'khas'
 aadhunik kaal main ek galat dharna he ki 'fa' or 'kh' kii dhvaniyaan sanskrit-parampara main videshaj hai
 Classically, 'f' is called 'subhuman' and 'b' is called 'jihvamulya'
 'kh' kii dhwani ko visarg main aghosh kanthya varnon se pehle uccharit kiya jaataa tha
 Apart from the change in language, some other variations are available in the two literatures: aage chalakar hamen chhandon kii pranali kaa bhi ek parivartan drushtigochar hota he
 Vedic verses Jagati, Trishubha, Anushtubha are completely unavailable in cosmic Sanskrit
 jabaki loukik sanskrit ke chand vanshastha, upendravajra, shikharini aadi vedon main purnatah aprapya hai
 Yes, it is definitely true that the verses used in secular Sanskrit are verses of Vedic Anushtubha
 vaidic evam loukik sanskrit kii bhinnataaon kii ore drushtipaat karte hue yah dhyaan dena aavashyak he ki siddhanth kii drushti se donon ek duusare se kaaphi milti-julati hai
 Some more sounds are found in the Vedas, such as ळ
 anya dhwani-siddhanth donon ke samaan hi hai or unamem koi bhi vaisaa antar nahin dikhaayi detaa jaisaa ki praakrit boliyon main hamen praapt hota he
 In the 19th century, Western scholars had a new look at both Avastai Persian and Vedic Sanskrit, and the fact of their deep bonding soon came to light
 unhone dekha ke avastai farsi or vaidic sanskrit ke shabdon main kuch saral niyamon ke saath ek se duusare ko anuvaadit kiya ja saktaa tha or vyakaran kii drushti se yah donon bahut nazadik the
 In his book "comparison of the Avastai grammar with Sanskrit and the Avastai alphabet and its transliteration" published in 1892, the linguist and scholar Abraham Jackson, for example, directly translated an Avastai religious verse into Vedic Sanskrit - abhishek choube hindi filmon ke ek nirdeshak hai
 2761 BCE represents the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2761 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar
 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus

 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 2761 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate hai

 The Mahar Regiment is an infantry regiment of the Indian Army
 yadhyapi multah ise maharashtra ke mahaar sainikon ko milakar banane kaa vichaar tha, kintu keval yahi bhartiya sena kaa ekmaatr regiment he jise bharat ke sabhi samudaayon or kshetron ke sainikon ko milakar banaaya gaya he
 The Mahar Scouts and their forces were recruited by the Maratha king Shivaji as soldiers in the fort
 unka ek bada hissaa banane company ke bombay sena ke chathe hisse main east india company company dwaara bhartee kiye gaye the
 The Bombay Army favored the Mahar soldiers for their bravery and loyalty to the flag and also because they could be trusted during the anglo-maratha War
 ve kai safaltaaon hasil kii he, koregaanv kii ladaai, jahaan mahaar bahul company sainikon ko ek bahut bada peshwa bajirao dwitiya ke netritv main parajeet main bhi shaamil he
 The battle was celebrated by an obelisk, the Koregaon Pillar, which went on to raid the summit of the Mahar Regiment until Indian independence
 bombay sena kii mahaar sainikon ne 1857 ke bhartiya vidroh] main karrwai ko dekha, or do regimenton main shaamil ho gaye is regiment ke british yuddh tahat vidroh "bolo hindustan kii jai" he
 After the rebellion the British officers of the Indian Army, especially those who had served in the First and Second Afghan Wars, began to give currency to the martial race doctrine
 yah siddhant tha ki kuch bhartiya jatiyon or samudaayon ke bich swaabhaavik rup se jangi, or adhik dusron kii tulana main yuddh ke liye anukool the
 a major proponent of this doctrine was Lord Roberts, who in November 1885 was the commander-in-chief, gradually "punjabisation" of the Indian Army to the detriment of other communities of the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon ke liye antim jhatka, 1892 main aayaa jab yah "varg regimenton" santhaan ko bhartiya sena main nirnay liya gaya
 The Mahars were not included in these class regiments, and it was notified that the Mahars, along with some other classes, were now enlisted in the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon, jo 104 vysarai kamishan adhikari or gaiyr kamishan adhikariyon or sipaahiyon ke ek mejabaan shaamil demobilized the
 This incident was perceived by the Mahars as a betrayal of their loyalty by a governmental they had worked for over a hundred years
 After the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilized
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 B
 R
 Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganisation of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, BR Ambedkar was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col v
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer noticed in dispatches
 They are also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Center was established at Kamptee
 The following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun Regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 His entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 Sogda, Sogdia or Sogdiana was an ancient civilization located in Central Asia
 yah aadhunik uzbekistan ke samarkand, bukhaaraa, khujand or shahar-e-sabz ke nagaron ke ilaake main faili hui thi
 The people of Sogda spoke a language called Sogdai which was the eastern Iranian language and became extinct with time
 mana jaataa he ki aadhunik kaal ke tajik, pashtun or yagnobi logon main se bahut inhi soudai logon ke vanshaj hai
 Note that the pronunciation of 'G' in 'sogda' is slightly different from 'G'

 When the Greek forces led by Alexander the Great arrived here in 327 BCE, they captured the famous fort called Sogdai Shila
 unhone bactria or sonda ko ek hi rajya main shaamil kar diya
 Soddai freedom from this died such that it could never come back again
 phir yahan ek unani raajaaon kaa silsilaa chalaa

 Near the Panjkant city of Tajikistan, these three have also got the pictures of the altar offered

 Thus, there is a beautiful coordination of anti-sentiment in the Congress organization
 sanyukt rajya america ne sangheey vidhanmandal kaa naam congress isliye rakhaa ki yah shabd sanghatmak sarkaar kaa parichaayak he
 It is true that in general there is very little change in the organization and rights of the Congress

 a transformer may have one, two or more windings
 do vinding vaale transafarmar ke praathmik evam dwitiyak vinding ke pheron kii sankhya evam unke vibhavantaron main nimnlikhit sambandh hota he: It is clear from this formula that by properly selecting the number of rounds of primary and secondary winding for a given value of primary voltage, we can get the desired voltage in the secondary winding
 jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se adhik hota he to aise transpharmar ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai
 In contrast, when the voltage of the secondary winding is less than the voltage of the primary winding, such a transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 transafarmar kaa mukhya upyog vidyut shakti ko adhik voltata yaa kam voltata main badalanaa he 
 Doing so brings convenience and efficiency in the use of electrical energy
 dhyatavya he ki adarsh transafarmar urja yaa shakti utpann nahin karata, na hi shakti kaa parivartan karata he, na hi aavriti badalata he
 Transformer used in the field of electricity sambhavat: sarvaadhik vyapak rup se upyog main aanevaala Vaidyut is Sacritra

 Connect the primary coil to the source of alternating current and the secondary to the load
 vidyucchumbakeey preran dwaara urja praathmik kundali se dwitiyak kundalan main sthanantarit hoti he
 The characteristics of operation of an ideal transformer are: vyavahaarat: yah adarsh sthiti dushprapya he
 The feed voltage associated with the primary coil of the transformer produces magnetic flux, which is connected to the plated core of the transformer
 parinamitra ke praathmik kundali se judi hui prayavarti voltata Ep ko ucchtam chumbakeey flux ke ghanatv Bm, patlit crode kii anuprastha kaat kaa kshetrafal A, prayavarti dhara kii aavrirti dhara kii aavriti f tathaa praathmik kundali main lapeton ko sankhya N1 ke padon main vyakt kiya jaataa he: The alternating magnetic flux generated by the current flowing in the primary coil also correlates with the wraps of the secondary coil
 praathmik or dwitiyak kundaliyon main antar keval lapeton kii sankhya kaa hota he, at: dwitiyak kundali main prerit voltata kaa prabhavi maan Thus the following ratio of primary and secondary voltage is obtained: praathmik kundali kii voltata ko badhaane ke aavashyaktaa padane par praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sakhya N1 ko dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se kam rakhaa jaataa he
 This type of transformer is called a high transformer and if the voltage of the primary coil is greater than the voltage of the secondary, then the number of wraps in the primary coil N1 will be larger than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 Generally the nature of the transformer is determined by the following: saamaanya lod par saadhaaran shakti parinamitra kii dakshata bahut adhik hoti he, jo chote uniton main 90 pratishat se lekar bade parinamitron main 98 pratishat tak vicharit hoti he
 General: The efficiency of the transformer expressed in percent can be expressed as: parinamitron kii taatkaalik dakshata or din bhar kii dakshata main antar hota he
 The control of the transformer means the relation of secondary voltage in the case of full load and secondary voltage in case of no load when the input voltage is constant
 pratishat ke rup main vyakt karne par niyantran ko adholikhit rup main paribhaashit kar sakate hai: Controls are of the order of 2 to 5 percent for small transformers and about 1 percent for elders
 transafarmar ke mukhyatah do bhaag hote hai: 1) Core - which is made of a magnetic material
 2) vinding - jo tanba, almunium yaa kisi anya suchalak ke taron athwa bas-baar se banaayi jaati he
 Apart from this, bad conductors are also used which prevent winding wheels from touching each other or from the core
 transformar tel kaa prayog ucch voltata ke parinamitron main kiya jaataa he jo brakedown shakti adhik hone se spark aadi rokte hai tathaa kor va kundliyon se ushma sokhkar use thanda karte hai
 Apart from oil and many other coolants are also used to keep the transformer cool, such as water and gas etc

 == brihaspativaar kii katha==? Thursday fast story pracheen samay kii baat he
 a king used to rule in India, he was very majestic and charity
 vah nity garibon or brahmanon kii sahaayta karata tha
 He used to go to the temple every day to worship Bhagavan, but this thing did not suit his queen, she neither donated to the poor nor worshiped God and forbade the king to do the same
 ek din raja shikaar khilne van ko gaye hue the to rani or daasi mahal main akeli thi
 At the same time, Brihaspati Dev went to the king's palace in monastery for alms and asked for alms, the queen refused to give alms and said - o Sadhu Maharaj, i am fed up with charity
 is kaary ke liye mere patidev hi bahut he ab aap aisi krupa karengi sara dhan nasht ho jaae tathaa main aaraam se rah sakuun
 The monk said - Goddess you are very strange
 dhan, santaan se koi dukhi nahin hota isko to sabhi chaahate hai
 The sinner also wishes for a son and money, if you have more money, then provide food to the hungry humans, make pyao, make donations to the Brahmins, make two well ponds, build a garden, garden etc
 Make a temple Pathshala Dharamshala and donate the marriage of virgin girls of the poor Make work as well as perform sacrifices etc
 spend your money in auspicious tasks
 aise karne se tumhaara naam paralok main sarthak hoga evam hoga evam swarg kii prapti hogi 
 But the sermon had no effect on the queen
 vah boli- maharaj mujhe aise dhan kii aavashyaktaa nahin jisko main anya logon ko daan du jisko rakhane or sanbhaalane main hi meraa sara samay nasht ho jaae ab aap aisi krupa karen ki sara dhan nasht ho jaae tathaa main aaraam se rah sakuun
 The monk replied that if you have such a desire, then do as you tell me, do the same on Thursday, wash the house with cow dung, wash your cases with yellow clay, take a bath while washing the cases, tell the king to shave the meat in the food Put the food cloth in the laundry, it will destroy all your wealth on Thursday
 itnaa kahkar vah sadhu maharaj vahaan se antardhan ho gayi
 The queen did the same as he had been saying to the monk
 teen brihaspativaar hi beete the ki uskaa samast dhan sampatti nasht ho gaya or bhojan ke liye donon tarasane lage
 Started unhappy with worldly pleasures
 tab vah raja rani se kehane laga ki tum yahaan par raho main duusare desh main jaau kyonki yahaan par mujhe sabhi manushya jaanate hai isliye koi kaary nahin kar saktaa
 Saying that the country is like a foreign land beggar, the king went to foreign country, went there to the forest and brought wood and brought it to life in the city
 idhar, raja ke bina rani or daasi dukhi rahane lageen 
 Someday i would get food and someday i would stay after drinking water
 ek samay jab rani or daasiyon ko saat din bina bhojan ke rahanaa padaa, to rani ne apni daasi se kaha, he daasi 
 My sister lives in a nearby city
 vah badi dhanwaan he 
 You go to him and ask for a careless 5 seers so that you can live a little for some time
 daasi rani kii bahan ke paas gai 
 It was Thursday on that day
 rani kaa bahan us samay brihaspativaar kii katha sun rahi thi 
 The maid conveyed her queen's message to the queen's sister, but the queen's sister did not reply
 jab daasi ko rani kii bahan se koi uttar nahin mila to vah bahut dukhi hui 
 He also got angry
 daasi ne waapas aakar rani ko sari baat bataa di 
 Hearing, where is the maid, the queen has no fault in it, when the bad days come, then there is no support, the good and bad are found in the calamity, which will be the will of God, it is the fault of our fate
 yah sab kahkar raa rani ne apane bhagya ko kosa 
 On the other hand, the queen's sister thought that my sister's maid was a slave, but i did not speak to her, it would make her very sad
 katha sunakar or pujan samaapt kar vah apni bahan ke ghar gai or kehane lagi, he bahan 
 i was fasting on Thursday
 tumhaari daasi gai parantu jab tak katha hoti he, tab tak na uthte he or na bolte he, isiliye main nahin boli 
 Say, why did she go to the maid
 rani boli, bahan 
 There was no grain in our house
 aisa kehete-kehete rani kii ankhen bhar ai 
 He also told his sister about starving for 7 days including the maidens
 isiilie maine daasi ko tumhaare paas paanch ser bejhar lene ke liye bheja tha
 Look at the sister, bid the queen's sister
 brihaspatidev bhagwaan sabaki manokamana purna karte he 
 Look, maybe you have cereal in your house
 pehle to rani ko vishwaas nahin hua parantu bahan ke aagrah karne par usne daasi ko andar bheja
 When she went inside the maid's house, she found a pitcher full of iridescence there
 use badi hairaani hui kyonki use ek ek bartan dekh liya tha 
 He came out and told the queen
 daasi rani se kehane lagi, he rani 
 When we do not get food, then we fast, so why not ask them about the fast and the method of the story, we will also fast
 daasi ke kehane par rani ne apni bahan se brihaspativaar vrath ke bare main poocha 
 His sister said, in the fast on Thursday, worship Lord Vishnu with gram lentils, jaggery and dry grapes in the root of the banana tree and light a lamp and listen to the story
 us din ek hi samay bhojanan karen bhojan pile khaadya padaarth kaa karen
 This makes the Guru God happy, gives food, son and wealth
 manokamana purna karte he 
 The queen's sister returned to her house after explaining the method of fasting and worship
 rani or daasi donon ne nishchay kiya ki brihaspatidev bhagwaan kaa pujan zarur karengen 
 Seven days later, when he came on Thursday, he fasted
 ghudsal main jaakar chanaa or gud been laayi tathaa uski daal se kele kii jad tathaa vishnu bhagwaan kaa pujan kiya 
 Now where should the yellow food come from
 donon badi dukhi hui 
 But he had fasted, so Lord Jupiter Dev was pleased
 ek saadhaaran vyakti ke rup main ve do thaalon main sundar pilaa bhojan lekar aae or daasi ko dekar bole, he daasi 
 This food is for you and your queen, you both accept it
 daasi bhojan paakar bahut prasann hui 
 He told the queen, let us have a meal with the queen, but the queen did not know anything about the arrival of the food, so she said go eat it because you make us laugh in vain
 tab daasi ne kaha ek vyakti bhojan de gaya he tab rani ne kaha vah vyakti tere liye hi bhojan de gaya he tu hi bhojan kar
 Then the maid said that the person has given beautiful yellow food for both of us in two plates so both i and you will have dinner together
 yah sunakar rani bahut prasann hue tathaa donon ne guru bhagwaan ko namaskara kar bhojan prarambh kiya
 Since then, she began to fast and worship Guru Bhagavan on every Thursday
 brihaspati bhagwaan kii krupa se unke paas dhan ho gaya 
 But the queen then started lazily as before
 tab daasi boli, dekho rani 
 Earlier you used to be lazy in this way, you used to have trouble keeping money, due to which all the money was destroyed
 ab guru bhagwaan kii krupa se dhan mila he to phir tumhen aalasy hota he 
 We have received this money after a lot of troubles, so we should do charity
 ab tum bhukhe manushyo ko bhojan karaao pyau lagavaao brahmanon ko daan do kua talab baavdi baag-bageeche aadi kaa nirmaan karaao mandir paathshaala dharmashala banavaa kar daan do nirdhanon kii kunvaari kanyaon kaa vivaah karaao saath hi yajna aadi karm karo apane dhan ko shubh kaaryon main kharch karo
 When your clan's fame increases and you get heaven and fathers are happy
 daasi kii baat maanakar rani shubh karm karne lagi 
 His fame started spreading
 ek din rani or daasi aapas main vichaar karne lageen ki na jane raja kis dasha main hongen, unki koi khoj khabar bhi nahin he 
 He earnestly prayed to Guru Bhagwan that the king should come back wherever he was, on that night, Jupiter Dev told the king in his dream that, o king, wake up, your queen remembers you to return to your country
 raja praat: kaal uthaa or jangal se lakdi kaatane ke liye jangal kii ore chal padaa
 While passing through the forest, he began to think about how much misery he suffered due to the mistake of the queen and had to leave and live in the forest and live in the forest by cutting wood and selling it in the city
 or apni dasha ko yaad karke vyakul hone laga
 At the same time Vrihaspitadeva came to the king in the guise of the monk and said, o woodcutter
 tum is sunsaan jangal main kis chintaa main baithe ho, mujhe batalaao 
 Hearing this, the king's eyes filled with water
 sadhu kii vandana kar raja ne apni sampurna kahani suna di 
 Mahatmas are kind
 ve raja se bole, he raja tumhaari patni ne brihaspatidev ke prati aparaadh kiya tha, jiske kaaran tumhaari yah dasha hui 
 Now don't worry, God will give you more money than before
 dekho, tumhaari patni ne brihaspativaar kaa vrath prarambh kar diya he 
 Now you also worship Lord Vishnu in the root of banana tree with gram dal jaggery and dry grapes in the fast on Thursday and light a lamp and listen to the story
 us din ek hi samay bhojan karen bhojan pile khaadya padaarth kaa karen
 
 bhagwaan tumhaari sab kaamanaayon ko purna karengen 
 The king said after listening to the monk, o God
 lakdi bechakar to itnaa paisa bhai nahin bachataa, jisase bhojan ke uparaant kuch bachaa sakuun 
 i have seen my queen distraught at night
 mere paas koi saadhan nahi, jisase uskaa samachar jaan sakuun 
 Then i do not know what story i tell
 sadhu ne kaha, he raja 
 Decide the worship of Lord Jupiter in the mind
 ve swayan tumhaare liye koi raah bana denge 
 On the day of Thursday, you go to the city with wood as usual
 tumhen roj se duguna dhan milegaa jisase tum bhaleebhanti bhojan kar loge tathaa brihaspatidev kii puja kaa saamaan bhi aa jaayegaa 
 What you have asked about the story of Thursday is as follows - brihaspatidev kii kahani In ancient times there was a very poor Brahmin
 uske koi sanntan na thi 
 He worships daily, his wife does not bathe nor worship any deity
 is kaaran brahaman devtaa bahut dukhi rahete the apni patni ko bahut samajhaate kintu uskaa koi parinaam na nikalataa
 By the grace of God, a girl was born to a Brahmin
 kanya badi hone lagi 
 She would chant Lord Vishnu after bathing in the morning
 brihaspativaar kaa vrath bhi karne lagi 
 After finishing the pooja and going to school, he would take barley in his fist and put it in the path of school
 lautate samay vahi jau swarna ke ho jate to unako binakar ghar le aati 
 One day, the girl was cleaning the barley in the soup by ripping those gold barley, when her mother saw it and said, 'O daughter
 sone ke jau ko fatakane ke liye sone kaa soup bhi to hona chaiye 
 The second day was Thursday
 kanya ne vrath rakhaa or brihaspatidev se sone kaa soup dene kii prarthana kii or kaha ki he prabhu yadi sachche man se maine aapaki puja kii ho to mujhe sone kaa soup de do
 
 brihaspatidev ne uski prarthana sweekaar kar lee 
 Like every day, she went to school to spread female barley
 paathshaala se lautakar jab vah jau been rahi thi to brihaspatidev kii krupa se use sone kaa soup mila 
 She brought him home and started cleaning barley from him
 parantu uski maa kaa vahi dhang rahaa 
 Once upon a time 
 kanya sone ke soup main jab jau saaf kar rahi thi, us samay us nagar kaa rajkumaar vahaan se niklaa 
 He was fascinated by the girl's appearance and work
 rajmahal aakar vah bhojan tathaa jal tyagkar udhaas hokar let gaya 
 When the king came to know that the prince had given up food and water, he along with his ministers went to his son and asked, o son! Why do you have any problem, someone has insulted you or there is some other reason, tell me, i will do the same thing that makes you happy
 apni pita kii baaten sunakar rajkumaar bolaa he pitaaji ! mujhe kisi baat kaa dukh nahin he kisi ne meraa apmaan nahin kiya he parantu main us ladki ke saath vivaah karnaa chahta hum jo sone ke sukh main jo ko saaf kar rahi thi 
 The prince also told the king the home address of the girl
 mantri us ladki ke ghar gaya 
 The minister pleaded before the king on behalf of the Brahmin
 kuch hi din baad brahaman kii kanya kaa vivaah rajkumaar ke saath sampann ho gaaya 
 As soon as he left his house, the Brahmin's house became poverty inhabited as before
 ek din dukhi hokar brahaman apni putree se milane gayi 
 The daughter saw her father's condition and asked about her mother's condition
 kanya ne bahut-sa dhan dekar apane pita ko vidaa kar diya 
 But a few days later the same situation happened again
 brahaman phir apni kanya ke yahaan gaya or sabhi haal kahato putree boli, he pitaaji 
 You bring Mataji here
 main unhen vah vidhi bataa duungi, jisase garibi dur ho jaae 
 When the Brahmin god reached his palace with his woman and went to the palace with his daughter, the daughter started explaining to her mother, o mother, you worship Lord Vishnu in the morning and take a fast and do a fast on Thursday
 parantu uski maa ne uski ek bhi baat nahin maani 
 She used to get up early in the morning and eat her daughter's children
 ek din uski putree ko bahut gussa aayaa, usne apni maan ko ek kothri main band kar diya 
 In the morning, after bathing her and getting her worshiped, her mother's intellect got well
 iske baad vah niyam se puja paath karne lagi or prayek brihaspativaar ko vrath karne lagi 
 He died in heaven after his death under the influence of this fast
 vah brahaman bhi sukhpurvak is lok kaa sukh bhogakar swarg ko praapt hua 
 In this way, the Gods who became saints by telling the story, disappeared from there
 dhire-dhire samay vyateet hone par phir brihaspativaar kaa din aayaa 
 The king cut wood from the forest and went to sell it in the city
 use us din or dinon se adhik dhan mila 
 The king brought gram, jaggery etc
 and fasted on Thursday
 us din se uske sabhi klesh dur hue 
 But when the next Thursday day came, he forgot to fast on Thursday
 is kaaran brihaspati bhagwaan naaraaz ho gaye 
 On that day, the king of that city organized a huge yagna and announced in all his kingdom that everyone should come to dine here
 kisi ke ghar chulhaa na jaale 
 Anyone who does not obey this order will be hanged
 raja kii aagyaanusaar rajya ke sabhi vaasi raja ke bhoj main sammilit hue lekin lakadahaara kuch der se pahunchaa, isaliye raja usko apane saath mahal main le gaye 
 When the king was feeding the woodcutter, the queen's eyes fell on the peg on which her haralatka was placed
 use haar khunti par lataka dikhaai nahin diya 
 The queen is convinced that this woodcutter has stolen my necklace
 usee samay sainik bulawaakar usko jail main dalava diya 
 The woodcutter began to think in jail that i did not know which pain i had received from the deeds of previous birth and started to remember the monk found in the forest
 tatkaal brihaspatidev sadhu ke rup main prakat ho gaye or kehane lage, are murkh 
 You have not told the story of Lord Jupiter, that is why you have received this misery
 ab chintaa mat kar 
 On the day of Thursday, you will find four pennies lying on the door of the jail, from them you will get rid of all the troubles
 agle brihaspativaar use jail ke dghaar par chaar paise mili 
 The king asked for the story of worship and told the story and distributed the offerings
 usee raatri main brihaspatidev ne us nagar ke raja ko swapn main kaha, he raja 
 Leave someone you have jailed tomorrow
 vah nirdosh he 
 Is the king
 rani kaa haar usee khunti par lataka hua he
 If you do not do this, i will destroy your kingdom
 raja praatavkaal uthaa or khunti par haar tanga dekhakar lakadahare ko bulaakar kshamaa maangi tathaa raja ke yogya sundar vastra-aabhushan bhent kar use vidaa kiya 
 According to the instruction of Gurudev, the king left his city
 raja jab nagar ke nikat pahunchaa to use bada hi aashcharya hua 
 More gardens, ponds and wells and many hospices, temples etc
 were built in the city than before
 raja ne poocha ki yah kiskaa baag or dharmashala or mandir he ? tab nagar ke sab log kehane lage ki yah sab rani or daasi dghaara banawaaye gaye he 
 The king was surprised and angry as to where the money would have come to the queen in his absence
 jab rani ne yah khabar suni ki raja aa rahe he to usne apni daasi se kaha, he daasi 
 See how bad the king left us
 vah hamaari aisi haalat dekhakar laut na jaaen, isaliye tu daravaaje par khadi ho ja 
 According to the queen's command, the maid stood at the door and when the king came, she brought him with her to the palace
 tab raja ne krodh karke apni talwaar nikaali or poochne laga, bataao, yah dhan tumhen kaise praapt hua he 
 Then the queen narrated the whole story that we got all this wealth from the influence of the fast of Jupiter Dev
 raja ne nishchay kiya ki main rojaanaa din main teen baar kahani kaha karunga or roj vrath kiya karunga 
 Now all the time the gram dal was tied in the king's dupatta and told the story thrice a day
 ek roj raja ne vichaar kiya ki chalo apni bahan ke yahaan ho aauun 
 After making such a decision, the king rode on his horse and walked with his sister
 maarg main usne dekha ki kuch aadmi ek murde ko liye ja rahe he 
 The king stopped them and started saying, "hey brothers
" meri brihaspativaar kii katha sun lo 
 He said, "our man has died, he has got his story
" parantu kuch aadmi bole, acha kaho, ham tumhaari katha bhi sunengen 
 The king took out the lentils and started telling the story
 jab katha aadhi hui to murda hilne laga or jab katha samaapt hui to ram-ram karke vah murda khadaa ho gaya
 The king moved forward
 use chalate-chalate shaam ho gai 
 On the way forward, he found a farmer running a plow in the field
 raja ne usase brihaspativaar kaa vrath sunne ko kaha ki jab tak main teri katha sunuunga tab tak chaar haraiya jot luungaa ja apni katha katha kisi or ko sunaanaa
 The king went ahead
 raja ke hatate hi bail pachhad khaakar gir gaye tathaa kisaan ke pet main bahut jo rase drard hone laga 
 At the same time, the mother of the farmer brought bread
 usne jab dekha to apane putr se sab haal poocha 
 The son told everything
 budhiya daud-daudi us ghudsavaar ke paas pahaunchi or usase boli, main teri katha sunuungi, tu apni katha mere khet par hi chalakar kahana 
 The king returned and told the story on the old man's farm, on hearing of which the bulls stood up and the pain of the stomach of the farmer also stopped
 raja apni bahan ke ghar pahunch gaya 
 The sister was very hospitable to the brother
 duusare roj praatavkaal raja jaagaa to vah dekhne laga ki sab log bhojan kar rahe he 
 When the king asked his sister, there is a man who has not eaten
 jo meri brihaspativaar kii katha sun le 
 Sister said, o brother, this country is like this, here people first eat food and later do other things
 agar koi pados main ho to dekh aati hum aisa kahkar vah dekhne chali gai parantu use aisa koi vyakti nahin mila jisane bhojan naa kiya ho
 Then he went to a potter's house, whose boy was ill
 use maaloom hua ki uske yahaan teen din se kisi ne bhojan nahin kiya he 
 When the queen asked the potter to listen to her brother's story, he agreed
 raja ne jaakar brihaspativaar kii katha kahi 
 After hearing that, his boy got well
 ab to raja ko prashansa hone lagi 
 One day the king said to his sister, o sister
 main ab apane ghar jaaunga, tum bhi taiyaar ho jaao 
 The king's sister asked her mother-in-law to go with her brother
 saas boli haa chali ja magar apane ladakon ko mat le janaa, kyonki tere bhai ke koi santan nahin hoti he 
 The sister said to her brother, brother
 main to chaluungi magar koi balak nahin jaayegaa 
 The king said, when a child does not go, what will you do? apni bahan ko bhi chhodkar dukhi man se raja apane nagar ko laut aayaa 
 The king told the whole story to his queen that we are childless, so no one likes to come to our house and without taking food he lay down on the bed
 rani boli,brihaspatidev ne hamen sab kuch diya he, ve hamen santan bhi avashya dengen 
 On the same night, Vrihaspati Dev said to the king in a dream, o king
 uth, sabhi soch tyaag de 
 Your queen is pregnant
 raja ko yah jaanakar badi khushi hui 
 a beautiful son was born from the womb of the ninth queen
 tab raja bolaa, he rani 
 a woman can live without food, but cannot live without saying
 jab meri bahan aaye to tum usase kuch mat kahana 
 The queen said yes
 jab raja kii bahan ne yah shubh samachar suna to vah bahut khush hui tathaa badhai lekar apane bhai ke yahaan ai 
 The queen then told him that the horse did not come and climbed its donkey, so the king's sister said, brother
 main is prakaar na kahati to tumhaare ghar aulad kaise hoti 
 Vrihaspati Dev fulfills all desires
 jo sadbhaavnapurvak brihaspativaar kaa vrath karata he evam katha padhata he athwa sunata he or dusron ko sunaata he, brihaspatidev uski sabhi manokamanaayen purna karte he, unki sadaiv raksha karte he 
 Those who worship Gurudev in good faith and fast in the world, all their wishes are fulfilled in the same way as the queen and the king praised the story of Vrihaspatideva in true spirit, then all their wishes were fulfilled by Vrihaspatidev ji
 isaliye sabko katha sunne ke baad prasad lekar janaa chaiye
