 Jaina Agamas are considered to have both distinction and impenetration in Dravya and synonyms
 parantu inke anusaar inkaa bhed vyaavhaarik he, parmarthat: donon abhinn he
 Similarly, both the harmony and the absence of the varna in the soul are inaccurate, but according to them, in practical terms the varna is in the soul and not in the spiritual form
 inhone deh or aatma ke aikya ko vyavahaarany main mana parantu nishchaynay main donon kaa bhed mana
 They consider matter as integral to power
 vaisheshik darshan main satta saamaanya ke kaaran dravya ko sat maanate hai, parantu unka kahana he ki is mat main to satta se bhinn hone ke kaaran dravya asat ho jayega
 Hence matter is the form of power and this is divine

 Their intention was to consider virtue and synonym as impervious to matter and to accept both hospitality and truthism from discrimination

 What is generally seen is not always true, and there is no necessity that truth should always be visible in pure form
 unhone aatma ke teen rup maane
 Infatuated with external substances, the mind that considers the body as integral to itself is Bahiraatma
 deh kaa bhedagyaan ho jane par mokshamarg arudh aatma ko antaratma kaha gaya he
 When the soul is decayed by meditation, the soul attains pure form
 tab usko paramatma kehete hai
 He has declared this divine being completely integral to the then philosophy by calling Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Buddha etc
 which probably no Jain Acharya did
 yahi inaki visheshta he jo anya jainacharyon se inhen alag karti he or inaki samanvayvaadee pravriti kaa nidarshan he
 He considered the soul to be different from the work, but integrated it with the imagination of the man of the Sankhya, but did not consider the soul as infeasible
 unke mat main aatma anaatmak parinman kaa kartta nahin he kintu parinami hone ke kaaran usko kartta bhi mana he
 Spirit, knowledge etc
 is the doer of the subjective results
 unka kahana tha ki tatv kaa vyavhaar or nischaynyon se varnan ho hi nahin saktaa
 Element is positive

 Only beings released from bondage and bondage have been called co-workers and divine divine beings

 isi prakaar kii anek maangen uthati rahi lekin kabhi ek sangathit rup se koi maang nahin kii gayi
 Organized separate Chhattisgarh state was first organized by the Congress Unite of Raipur in 1924 and later discussed in the annual session of the Indian Congress in Tripura
 ek kshetreey congress sanghathan banane kii bhi maang uthi

 But after this, the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Dr
 Raman Singh, announced 9 more new districts on 15 August 2011 and announced that they came into existence from January 1, 2012, thus there are now 27 districts in Chhattisgarh

 That is why language and literature flourish simultaneously
 parantu ham dekhte he ki chhattisgadhi likhit sahitya ke vikaas ateet main spasht rup main nahin hui he
 Many writers believe that the reason is that in the past, the writers here made Sanskrit the medium of writing and remained a bit indifferent to Chhattisgarhi
 isiilie chhattisgadhi bhashaa main jo sahitya rachaa gaya, vah kareeb ek hazaar saal se hua he
 Many writers have divided this one thousand years in this way: yah vibhaajan kisi pravriti kii saapekshik adhikta ko dekhakar kiya gaya he
 Another noteworthy fact is that in other Aryan languages, even in Chhattisgarhi, only the poetic works have been done till the medieval period

 Painter Maqbool Fida Hussain gave his inspiration to Madhuri Dixit after seeing "didi Tera Dewar Deewana" in Hum Aapke Hain Kaun
 unhone film ko 67 baar dekha
 Regarding Dixit's dance in the song, Hussain confessed, "waist that she is out of this world
 maine kabhi aisi nartki nahin dekha he, or maine sabase acchhee dekhi he
 His words have been changed to body language
 " unhone dikshit se prerit chitron kii ek shrinkhalaa ko chitrit kiya

 He worked on caste and caste system, social stratification, culturalization and westernization in South India
 unhone 'prabal jati' kii avdhaaran prastut kii
 'mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas' was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the field of science and engineering by the Government of India in 1977
 ye karnataka se hai
 Even though the Adivasis of Indian Sociology may not be formalized, they have enriched this discipline in independent India with their theoretical contributions, unique understanding of caste and the method of participatory observation that they have given to the top sociologists of the country
 Enough to include
 samajashaastra main unhen samskruthikaran, prabhutvshaalee jati or vot bank jaisi moulik prasthaapanaaon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Srinivas was also the creator of the institutions
 baroda or dilli vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra ke vibhaagon kii sthapana kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 His contribution to the development of Indian sociology will also be considered as classical in terms of establishing and guiding high-level institutions of research and study
 gramin samudaay or jati kii sanrachana ke vishisht adhyayan ke alaava em
en
 shrinivas ne vigyaan ke saamaajik prabhaav, gandhi ke dharmik chintan, maanavshaastra ke itihaas se lekar gender jaise vishyon par bhi vicharottejak kaam kiya he
 Srinivas's work is considered to be a rare confluence of objective supervision, fineness of analysis and theoretical depth
 unka lekhan antar-vishyaktaa ko ek khaas tarah kaa jamini sandarbh pradaan karata he
 Srinivas's sociological vision explores the external structure of events and fathoms the structures and historical forces that compose them
 saamudayik jivan ke baarik byoron or antardrushtiyon ko saral bhashaa main prastut karne kii unki kshamta unhen samakaleen samajashastriyon se ek alag vyaktitv pradaan karti he
 In this sense, they transcend the thematic vocabulary and choose the simple and popular language
 ise unki vidvatta kaa janawaad hi kaha jayega ki unki saidhantik avadharanaayen apane kutarthon main uljhane ke bajaay vishay ko samajhane main zyaada madad karti hai
 Srinivas created a new land for Indian sociology at the level of ideology
 ullekhneey he ki jis daur main shrinivas bhartiya samaaj ke adhyayan kii taiyaari kar rahe the us samay samaaj-vigyaanon par america or british academik prasthapanaayen haaavee thi
 The prevailing approach in American universities emphasized Sanskritic traditions to understand the society of the Indian subcontinent
 iske asar main bhartiya samajashastri samakaleen yatharth ke adhyayan ke liye sanskrit ke sroton or bharat- vidya / indolji ko zyaada pramanik maanate the
 Srinivas was the first sociologist to challenge this dominant position
 unhone apane lekhan se sabit kiya ki samajashaastra main samaaj ke vaastavik kaaryakalapon or gatividhiyon kaa adhyayan shastreey sandarbhon par nirbhar rahane se zyaada shreyaskar he
 The concepts of dominant caste and Sanskritisation presented by Srinivas have been widely used by historians of streams like subaltern of history-writing besides political scientists
 is arth main unke krititv ko ek bauddhik parampara kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he jo naye-puraane vidwaanon ke liye ek zaruri sandarbh kii haisiyat hasil kar chukaa he
 Incidentally, the concept of dominant caste reflects dominance in a particular village or region of a caste due to factors such as number force, land ownership, education and job, so Sanskritisation is the culture of upper castes especially Brahmin class by lower castes
 Indicates the tendency to adopt customs, language and costumes etc
 haalaanki unki teesri avadharana vot bank, samaaj-vigyaanon main sthai jagah nahin bana paayi parantu raajnneeti ke dainik vimarsh or media jagat main is pad kaa dhadlle se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In studying the political and social structure of independent India, all these three concepts and related discourse have acquired immediate significance
 prabhutvshaalee jati or samskruthikaran kii avadharanaayen bharat kii saamaajik vyavastha or uske santhnik dhaanche ke nirnaayak tattvon ko samajhane main madad karti hai
 Although the concept of Sanskritisation is no longer considered as important due to the decreasing legitimacy of Brahminical ideals, the fact remains that Sanskritisation was a fairly notable trend for a long period of the twentieth century and even after independence
 dalit andolan or mandal ayog ke baad ubhari raajnneeti main samskruthikaran kii pravriti ksheen hoti gayi he lekin prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana ko bharat ke gramin samaaj main chalane vaali raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa vishleshan karne main aaj bhi ek jaruri aujaar kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 Many contemporary sociologists have been urging to assess Srinivas's work in the larger context of nationalist sociology
 unka kahana he ki swatantra bharat kaa shahari abhijan aupniveshik shashan ke aadhunikeekaran kii pariyojna ko jari rakhana chahta tha
 Therefore, the same colonial arrays of thought and thought were active in the work of nationalist sociologists on the basis of which the British power had been legitimizing its rule
 in vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati or samudaay par kendrit shrinivas jaise samajashastriyon kaa krititv ek akhil bhartiya sanskritvaadi hindu dharm kii samaj ko peethika pradaan karata he
 But Srinivas's vision is a hasty plea to be overtly or indirectly guided by the foundations of British or American anthropology, which, despite the lack of evidence, dares to prepare charge sheets
 yah daleel shrinivas ke krititv kii us pravriti ko lakshith karne main chook karti he jisamen shrinivas samudaay kaa adhyayan karte hue samudaay or apane sambandhon ke dwait par bhi vichaar karte hai
 Srinivas considers the basic foundations of sociology and anthropology in a similar way
 gauratlab he ki shrinivas sahabhaagi adhyeta ke taur par khud ko ek aise adhyeta ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisaki iyatta apane vishay yani logon se alag nahin he
 Srinivas did not classify the people or community he studied
 is sambandh main kai british maanavshastri yah maanate rahe hai apane samaaj kaa adhyayan karne vaale maanavshastri ko alag tarah kii mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 According to him, the anthropologist of the developed country always wants to imprison an indigenous anthropologist in a particular mold by pointing to his inferior position
 shrinivas ne is masale par deshaj maanavshastri kii sthiti ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ki jab koi bhartiya maanavshastri bharat kii kisi jati yaa anya samooh kaa adhyayan karata he to vah jati yaa samooh uske liye anya bhi hota he lekin saath hi is baat ko darkinar nahin karnaa chahie ki us jati yaa samooh ke katipay saanskrithik rup, vishwaas or mulya ukt adhyeta se bhi mail khate hai
 That is, in such a situation the Indian anthropologist actually studies the self in one way or the other
 is myne main vah jati yaa samooh uske liye nitant aparichit yaa anya nahin rah jaataa kyonki donon ek hi samskruti se jude hote hai
 Srinivas considers this situation as unusually complex, multilayered and duplex
 dhyaan se dekhen to shrinivas apane vishay ke saath antar or samanta ke jin binduon baat karte hai unhen dekhte hue un par rashtravaadi samajashastri hone kaa aarope damdaar nahin lagata
 In fact, Srinivas stresses that this multiplicity of self and others in study is far better than the anthropologist's singularity of being a member or an outsider of his community
 yah gauratlab he ki apane shodh adhyayan ke liye shrinivas ne jis rampura gaanv ko chunaa tha uski jati vyavastha ke adhyayan main ve chicago skool ke kai prekshanon kaa upyog karte hai
 Srinivas proving the pre-british concept of varna as a bookish point of view, saying that this vision dwarfs the dynamic aspects of caste
 haalaanki shrinivas kaa jati-adhyayan ek gaanv kii sthaneey sanrachana par kendrit tha lekin vah is parighatna kii akhil bhartiya vyapti ko lekar bhi sachet the
 In one of his articles, he points to the fact that caste is undoubtedly an all-india structure, as groups can be seen everywhere in the country that form a distinct group based on paternal and marital relationships
 shrinivas is sambandh main in samoohon ke parmparik rojgaar kaa hawala bhi dete hai
 He also says that the existence of castes serving Brahmins, untouchables, farmers, artisans, merchants and others can be seen everywhere in the country
 jati ke is adhyayan main shrinivas kshetreey bhinnataaon or pashchimi shiksha, prashasnic naukari, shahar se milane vaali aay jaise karkon kaa bhi ullekh karte hai jinka jati kii sanrachana par vyapak asar padaa he
 In the long term, Srinivas, as a sociologist, has also freed the Indian village and caste structure from the theoretical dominance of colonial perceptions
 or saath hi dyumon jaise samajashastri kii manyataon kaa bhi pratwaad kiya jo yah pratipaadit kar rahe the ki jatigat vibhinnataayen bhartiya gaanv ko samudaay kaa rup nahin lene detii
 When Srinivas talks about the concept of rural community and the economic-cultural interdependence of villages, he also talks about All India Civilization in a latent manner
 kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki shrinivas ne jati ke adhyayan main brahmanvaadi yaa ucch jati kaa drushtikon apanaaya he
 But looking at this argument from the right angle, it seems to have originated from colonial sociology
 shrinivas kii tark-yojana vastav main pashchimi samajashastriyon kii bharat ke gramin samudaayon ke sambandh main pratipaadit sthool or alp-chintit dharanaon ko ujagar karti he
 In a nutshell, Srinivas's work provides many basic arguments in the Western discourse of philosophical propositions, perceptions of self, community and nation
