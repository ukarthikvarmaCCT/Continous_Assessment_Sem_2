 According to some scholars, 'accounting' is used in a wide sense
 iske teen ang ho sakate he : The process of writing transactions, ie the business part which can be called bookkeeping
 rachanaatmak kaary ko prakriya arthath saiddhanthik bhaag jise lekhankan kaha ja saktaa he
 The process of critical work, that is, the critical part, can be called audit
 pehle pustapaalan tathaa lekhankan ke kaaryon main vishesh antar nahin mana jaataa tha
 But in today's industrial age, both bookkeeping and accounting have become separate tasks
 saadharantah agralikhit kaary pustapaalan, lekhankan tathaa ankekshan teenon ke kshetra main aa jate hai : Bookkeeping - As is clear from the above point, bookkeeping is the art of accounting of business deals in journal and ledger
 hisaab-kitaab rakhane kii saadhaaran yogyata vaala koi bhi vyakti is kaary ko suvidha ke saath kar saktaa he
 This task is just to write mechanically
 lekhankan- uparyukt bindu ke anusaar lekhapal kaa kaary pustapalak ke kaary ke baad se prarambh hota he
 For this reason, it is said that accounting begins from where bookkeeping ends
 iske kshetra main shesh nikaalane se lekar antim khate taiyaar karne tathaa aavashyak bhul-sudhaar evam samaayojan karne ke kaary bhi aa jate he
 In short, work is the process of summarizing and analyzing
 saransh arthath talapat or phir iske vishleshan antim khate taiyaar karke kiya jaataa he
 The accountant is a well-educated person who is also clever in the work of bookkeeping
 uskaa kaary antim khate banaakar tarkpurna adhyayan karnaa hai
 According to various authors the definitions of audit are as follows: 1
 epa aar em di paula- ankekshan kaa arth chittha tathaa laabh-haani khate or unase sambandhit pustakon, khaaton tathaa pramankon kii jaanch karne se he taaki ankekshak apane aapako santusht kar sake or eemaandaaree se yah report de sake ki chittha niyamanusaar banaaya gaya he or vyapaar kii sahi tathaa thik sthiti ko prakat karata he jaisaa ki soochnaaon, spashtikarnon evam pustakon ke aadhaar par dekha gaya he jo use mili hai

 Montgomery - Auditing is the systematic examination of the books of an institution and the articles of deal so that the audit can verify the economic practices of the business and give its report regarding its results
 3
 larence aar dixi- ankekshan hisaab-kitaab ke lekhon kii jaanch he taaki yah spasht ho sake ki ve purnatah evam sahi rup se sambandhit saudon ke liye kiye gayi hai
 Also, it can be ensured that all the deals have been done officially
 ' 4
 Spicer and Pagler- "an audit of a number of books, accounts and certifiers of a business institution is called an audit, on the basis of which the auditor can say satisfactorily, based on the explanations and information received by him and which is revealed in the books
" According to him, the letter of the institution shows its 'financial condition' and the profit and loss account of the institution's profit and loss in true and true form
 yadi nahin to kin-kin baton se vah asantusht he or kyon
 ' 5
 josef lankaster- jaanch, pramann va satyaapan kii aisi prakriya ankekshan kehalaati he jiske dwaara chitthey kii shuddhta kaa pataa chalata he
 Thus, it can be conveniently said that there is a research of audit forms, certifiers and books of accounts from which books are written, in respect of the audit sheets and other prospectus which are made from these books, its report Give it to those who have appointed him to report
 ' 6
 Arthur W
 Holmes -
 'the audit is a scientific and systematic examination of the articles, certifiers, legal documents and other details of a public or private institution, whose purpose: 7
 ronaald e iris- 'vartmaan rup main ankekshan pustakon, pramankon evam anya aarthik va kanoonee lekhon kii niyamit or vaigyanik jaanch he, jisase vaastaviktaaon kaa sampaadan kiya ja sake tathaa laabh-haani khate se prakat shuddh aay or chitthey se prakat hone vaali aarthik sthiti ke sambandh main report di ja sake
 ' 8
 je aar bottleboy- ankekshan kisi vyapaar ke hisaab-kitaab kii pustakon kii aisi vishisht evam aalochanatmak jaanch he jo un prapatron evam pramankon kii sahaayta se kii jaati he jisase ve taiyaar kiye gayi hai
 The purpose of this investigation is to find out whether the letter and profit-loss account of the organization created for a certain time reveals its true and correct position
 ' 9
 AW Hanson - Auditing of such articles is called auditing so that they can be believed and the details given by them can also be believed
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par nishkarsh rup me- Auditing is the specific and discreet examination of the books of account of a business organization, which is done by a qualified and impartial person with the help of certifiers, forms, information and explanations received from the institution, so that the auditor remains for a fixed time
 In relation to the accounting, we can report that, sanstha- ankekshan kisi bhi sanstha ke hisaab-kitaab kaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Independent person - The audit work should be done by someone who does not have any connection with the business or institution
 tabhi nishpaksh jaanch sambhav he
 Hence presently Chartered Accountants have been appointed
 jaanch kaa swaroop- ankekshan dwaara kii gayi jaanch sirf ganit se sambandhit shuddhta ko hi prakat nahin karti balki yah ek budhimattapurna nishpaksh jaanch he jo hisaab kii purna shuddhta darshaati he
 Accounting books - Auditing involves checking the books of account
 ankekshak ko apana kaaryakshetra sirf pustakon tak hi simit nahin karnaa hota he balki anya vaidhanik pustaken tathaa vibhinn tathyon kii jaankaree bhi kerani hoti hai
 Authenticators and Forms - Audit books are checked on the basis of certifiers and forms, if they are not available, they are confirmed by copies
 soochna evam spashtikaran- jaanch kaa aadhaar pramank hi hote hai phir bhi ankekshak yaaden pramank se santusht nahin he to len-denon kaa satyaapan karne ke liye suchnaayen tathaa spashtikaran maang saktaa he
 Intelligence - The work of investigation by audit is very important, so in this work intelligence and cleverness are required which is gained from the experience of this work
 jaanch kaa uddeshy- lekha-pustakon kii jaanch kaa uddeshy ek nishchit avadhi main banaaye gayi laabh-haani khate ke parinaamon ko evam ek nishchit tithi ko chitthey main darshaye gayi sampatti evam dayitvon kaa satyaapan karnaa he tathaa santushti par pramaan-patr dena hota he
 In fact, the auditor has to express his opinion on the examination of the final accounts
 niyamaanukoolta- bhartiya company adhinium, 1956 ke antargat company kaa chittha va laabh-haani khaataa banaate samay bhi kuch mahatvapurn niyamon ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 Therefore, the company auditor has to write in his report whether the letter is the norm or not
 avadhi- ankekshan saadharantah ek vittiya varsh yaa ek lekha varsh ke lekhon kaa kiya jaataa he
 If the accounts of more than one year are audited, this investigation is called research
 parinaam- lekhon kii jaanch ke baad isaki satyata va auchity ke vishay main report deni hoti he
 If the auditor is dissatisfied with anything, it clearly describes it in his report
 lekhankan anivaaryta ke rup main vyaavhaarik rup main lekhankan kaa sambandh vyavsaay ko jivit rakhane ke liye tathaa samaaj main pratishtha praapt karne hetu anivaary hai
 The following arguments can be given for this: aaj ke yug main kisi vyavsaay se hone vaale laabh athwa haani kaa sahi-sahi gyaan bina lekhankan ke sammav nahin he
 If the financial condition of the businessman is strong and the financial resources are very good, then the sale is more as a result of selling cheaper than other businessman, but only after the bankruptcy, he will know that he has sold the item for less than the cost
 vyavsaay main len-dein adhik hote hai visheshtah jahaan udhaar par maal adhik bechaa jaataa he vahaan dendaaron ke naam yaad rakhana sambhav nahin he at: lekhankan anivaary hai
 Profit or loss at the end of a certain period
 iske liye lekhankan anivaary he
 If the professional accounting books are maintained properly, then the current year's income-expenditure or profit-loss can be compared to the profit-loss of previous years
 lekhankan ke madhyam se vyapaaree ko apni vittiya sthiti kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Articles have great importance in assessment
 yadi lekhe niyamanusaar rakhe hon to yah bahut hi sahaayak siddh hote hai
 The total amount of money that a trader has to pay to a person can be obtained only from accounting
 alaabhprad kriyaaon ko chhodkar laabhprad kriyaayein prarambh karke adhik laabh kamaaya ja saktaa he tathaa yadi kaaryakshmata main kami he to unke kaarnon ko jaanakar unhen dur kiya ja saktaa he
 This work is possible only through accounting
 kisi vyavsaay main yadi uchit rup se lekha-pustaken rakhi jaati hai to us vyavsaay kii pratishtha badhati he
 Accounting also has the following benefits: lekhakarm vilasita ke rup main It is considered a luxury for small traders as they have limited requirements but at the present time it does not seem completely appropriate
 ankekshan vilasita ke rup main Still have to be used to hide the deceit in the accounts, which the auditor cannot catch despite proper cleverness and caution
 at: ankekshan nirarthak he
 On the basis of the above facts, we can say that audit is luxury in small business but it would be wrong for all businesses to call audit as luxury
 choti sansthaaon ke jahaan ek-do karmchaaree hai tathaa lekhakarm kaa kaary swami ekaaki vyapaaree yaa saajhedaar hi dekhte he at: ankekshan aavashyak nahin hai, lekin bade vyavsaay main yah laabhprad evam atyadhik aavashyak he, vilasita nahin
 No luxury of audit karmchaariyon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- ankekshan karwaane ke falswaroop karmchaaree kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi hoti he kyonki ve jaanate hai ki kaary thik se na karne par ankekshak dwaara truti pakadi ja sakati he ! Increased efficiency of employees - As a result of efficient audit, employees become efficient in their work because the auditor keeps on reporting and deficiencies in his report from time to time and also during the audit
 prabandhakon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- jab prabandhakon ko yah maaloom rahata he ki unke dwaara kiye gayi kaary par ankekshak apni report prastut karegaa jo ki sarvamaanya hogi to ve apana kaary purna eemaandaaree se karenge
 Assistants in the development of business - everyone believes in audited accounts and this increases the fame of business and provides facilities to the business from all sides which leads to the development of business
 diwalia hone kii dasha main nirnay sambhav- yadi lekha-pustaken thik prakaar rakhkar ankekshan karvaa rakhaa he to nyaayalay dwaara rin mukti aadesh praapt karne main sahaayak siddh hote hai
 In the absence of this, it may take longer
 bhavi yojana banane main sahaayak- prabandhak kai varshon ke antim khaaton ke aadhaar par tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hai tathaa yah dekhte he ki kaaryakshmata kis prakaar badhaayi ja sakati he
 Increase in plant and machine efficiency - The audit of cost accounts shows how much functionality the machines have and for what reasons the full functionality of the machines is not being used
 in kaarnon kii jaankaree praapt karkekaryakshmata ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Inevitability of audit ankekshan se kaaryakshmata par prabhaav padataa hai at: ise vilasita nahin kaha ja saktaa hai
 In the following situations it is mandatory - is prakaar yah kahana purnroop se satya na hoga ki lekhankan anivaary he or ankekshan vilasita hai
 Accounting is also a luxury in small businesses, while it is compulsory for large businesses
 kintu phir bhi lekhankan va ankekshan ek sikke ke do pahalu hai
 If there is no accounting, then whose audit will be done
 or lekhankan sirf akelaa ho to uski satyata kii vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 Making errors is a part of human nature, the main purpose of audit is to detect and prevent inaccuracy and embezzlement
 ankekshak trutiyon kaa pataa lagane hetu praarambhik lekhon kii jaanch, jarnal kii jaanch, rocked shesh kii jaanch, khaaton ke sheshon kii jaanch, sahaayak bahiyon kii khatauni kii jaanch, gat varsh ke talapat se milan, antar kii raashi kaa pataa lagaana, talapat ke jod kii jaanch aadi kriya apana saktaa hai
 If the auditor used so much care, skill and intelligence in his work as was the case in those circumstances and he had done his utmost, which was absolutely necessary to find the errors
 yadi phir bhi kapat kaa pataa lagane main asamarth rahaa ho to ankekshak ko uttaradaayi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa hai
 Auditing work never means that the auditor has insured the inaccuracies and embezzlement, nor does he guarantee that all the impurities and embezzlement will be found
 usase sirf yah apeksha kii jaati he ki vah apana kaary uchit saavdhaanee evam chaturaai se karegaa

 The credibility and adequacy of accounting records and other information should be checked using various methods to form an opinion on the financial statements
 is hetu ankekshak aisi pravidhiyon kaa paalan karata he jisase vah yah vishwaas dilaa sake ki vittiya vivaran kisi upkram kii vittiya sthiti va parichaalan parinaamon kii sahi va uchit chhavi prastut karte hai
 ' ankekshak apane peshewar anubhav va nirnayan kshamta se jaanch ke nishchit mandand tay karata he aisa karte samay usase yah apeksha nahin kii ja sakati ki vah apni dakshata kshetra se baahar jaakar kaary kare
 The auditor starts the work by setting limits to his work
 aisi do seemayen hai :-vistrut seemaa, gahan seemaa
 In the broadest range, the auditor decides how many behaviors to be audited, while in the deepest range it determines which behaviors to examine and how deeply to examine

 haan, itnaa sanket to zarur miltaa he ki ek shahi farmaan dwaara maharavat pratap singh ke uttaradhikari prithvi singh ko shah alam ne "basaad ke pargane kii aay ke alaava apni praja ke liye khud apane sikke dhaal sakane kaa adhikaar" diya tha
 After the formation of the princely state of Pratapgarh, by 1578, Pratapgarh was ruled over all 548 small big villages except Barrawarda and Basad
 After 17 invasions in 1586, Baravarada and after more than 43 attacks in 1603, separated the tax related treaty and army
 Basad also joined Pratapgarh with the talk, after which the basa was made a separate pargana
 yah bhi ullekh itihaas ke dastavejon main miltaa he ki gopal singh ke shashan-kaal main marathe har taraf sar uthaane lage the or ve baahubal ke aadhaar par desi riyasaton par baqayda sangathit hamale karte the, par gopal singh ne mewar se apane achche sambandhon ke chalate udaipur ke maharana se na keval dhariyavad pargane kaa shashan praapt kiya tha, balki vah maraathon kii lut se bhi apane rajya ko bahut kuch mahfuz rakh sake the
 During the Mughal and British period, Pratapgad state remained untouched by 'external' interventions, some not only because the erstwhile kings here decided to give an annual 'khiraj' of Rs 15,000 to the rulers of Delhi, but Salim Singh gave the Mughal- Renewed the written approval of the ruler Shah Alam II to introduce new 'salimshahi Coins' for his kingdom, which shield the local-mint of 'paratabgarh' Was going to go
 1761 main malharav holkar ke senapati tukoji raav ne pratapgarh kii gheraabandi kii, par vah yahaan se koi dhanrashi vasuul kar paane main naakaamayaab rahaa
 haan, do saal baad 1763 main malharav holkar ne udaipur jate vaqt saalim singh se vasuuli zarur kii
 tab sab taraf maraathon kaa utpaat bada prabal tha
 During the reign of Samant Singh, son of Salim Singh, who had settled 'salamgarh' near Pratapgarh, the Marathas even tied up an annual 'khiraj' of Rs 72,720 / - Salimshahi rupees in lieu of not attacking and looting Pratapgarh
 Inspired by the terror of the Marathas, Samant Singh made a treaty with the British in 1804 and an agreement was made to give the same amount to the British, which the Marathas used to recover; But due to the new state policies of Lord Cornwallis, this agreement also remained in force for a long time and Pratapgad eventually came under the direct control of the British rule
 1818 main ek dfa phir pratapgarh kii angrezi sarkaar se 12 sutreey sandhi hui, jiske anusaar pehle saal main, 35,000 rupee or paanchaven saal main 72,700 / - rupee angrejon ko 'khiraj' main dene kaa ikraar kiya gaya
 His memorial can be seen in Pratapgarh at this link- samant singh ne pratapgarh kaa shashan apane putr deep singh ko saunp diya, jisane kuch samay tak to thikthak kaam chalaaya, par uske hi rajya ke kuch virodhiyon ko sthaneey str par deep singh kaa shashan ghor asantoshjanak jaan padaa or shashan ke prati vidroh kii ghatnaayen tej hone lageen, lihaaza sar uthaane vaale vidrohiyon ko kuchalane kii garaj se deep singh ne kuch kii hatya tak karvaa di
 angrezi aakaaon ko deep singh kii yah kaarywahi nagavar guzari or unhone deep singh ko use devgarh chale jane or vahiin rahane kaa hukum de daalaa
 kuch vakt tak to devgarh main deep singh lagbhag nazarband rahaa, par angrezi raaj kaa hukum taalte hue vah thode hi vakt baad pratapgarh laut aayaa
 The British Raj did not tolerate this spade, so a contingent of the English army defeated and captured Deep Singh in a face-to-face battle and sent him to Achera-garhi under Gwalior, where in 1826 this king as a prisoner Took his last breath
 Even though the pages of Deep Singh's life are full of political events and upheavals, his fame is still due to being the builder of the Deepeshwar Temple and Deepeshwar Talab built in Pratapgarh city
 is strot ke thik ulat, "bharat main angrezi raaj"ke yashasvi lekhak pandit sundar laal ne deepasingh ko ek deshbhakt senaanee kunwar deepasingh krantikari ke rup main in shabdon main yaad kiya he- "in India for the first time the bugle of independence played in Bengal
 ‘anand math’ giroh ke kuch krantikari bhaag kar dakshini raajapootaana yaa malwa-anchal main aae
 Kunwar Deep Singh of Devalia Pratapgarh came in contact with Bengali revolutionaries
 duusari ore uskaa sambandh holkar darbar se tha kyonki uski riyasat mughalon ko holkar ke dwaara khiraj bhejti thi
 At that time Jaswantrao Holkar was a glorious prince and in his mind was also waging a tide of rebellion against the British as the British fought the Marathas amongst themselves and thus destroyed the Maharashtra Mandal
 deepasingh or jaswant raav holkar ne kranti kii taiyaariyaan kii or unka pehla kaam in sandhiyon ko na hone dena tha, jinhen chambal ke kinare padaav daal kar baitha lord lake or duusare angrej malwa or raajaputaane ke deshi riyasaton ke raajaaon se sampark kar rahe the
 It was the effort of Kunwar Deep Singh that the British failed to write a treaty from the princely state of Pratapgarh in 1800
 san 1802 main pun: praytn kiya gaya
 Among the revolutionary, princely states of Devalia Pratapgad from Bengal, there was a twenty-year-old young man of the Nimbarka sect named Ramakrishna Das
 usne apni pratibha, vidvatta or unase bhi adhik apni utkrisht rashtriyata se, rajpariwaar ko itnaa prabhavit kiya ki parivaar ne devliya main apane sabase bade nijee mandir ‘shri raghunatha dwaar’ kaa mahant ramakrishna das ko bana diya
 This succeeded the trick of Kunwar Deep Singh that he was able to secure a guest refugee revolutionary according to his position, dignity
 angrej jasoos, anand math ke giroh ke bikhare hue logon or jaswant raav holkar ke viplavvaadiyon kaa suraag lagaate hue devliya pahunche
 At his instigation, a contingent of Bengal infantry arrived in Malwa, about eleven miles from Devalia, to arrest Ramakrishna Das and Kunwar Deep Singh
 lekin deepasingh zyada chatur niklaa or uske sainikon ne bengal paidal sena ke captain jon boyli or anya logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 The British were very upset about this
 lekin jab tak riyasat main raaj-kaaj kunwar deepasingh ke haathon main pradhanmantri ke rup main rahaa, angrej hastkshep na kar sake
 The news kept going only through his detectives
 kuch varsh baad kunwar deepasingh ko tarbooz main jehar de kar maar dene kaa jaghanya kaary angrejon ke inhen zarakhrid jasuson kaa tha, jinhen un dinon angrejon ke dhanyavad-patr baraabar milte rahe
 In those days a great clergyman named Bishop Haber visited India
 usne malwa or devliya pratapgarh kii bhi yatra kii
 He mentions Kunwar Deep Singh in his travelogue
 yah nirvivaad satya he ki yadi jaswantrao holkar, kunwar deepasingh or bengal ke saathiyon ko desh ke anya shaskaon or janata kaa sahyog mil jaataa, to san 1857 kii kranti kam se kam chalis-pachaas varsh purv ho jaati or safal bhi ho jaati kyonki un chalis-pachaas varshon main angrejon ko bhartiya saamaajik, rashtriya or aarthik jivan main foot daalane kaa jo mauka mila, vah na miltaa
 There would not have been a chance to destroy Indian industry-thorns and self reliance

 These extreme powers, Tamoguni and Rajoguni respectively, are a crisis for development
 Brahma requested protection from Mahamaya
 With the inspiration of Mahamaya, Vishnu Yoginindra renounced and killed the demons
 The work of creation of Brahma goes ahead

 Relatively weak human group in physical force from animals - Aryashakti chose to overtake the carriage of his civilization among the terrifying wild animals like buffalo etc
