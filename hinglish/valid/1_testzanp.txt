 The Commonwealth Prajabhoomi or Commonwealth Territories, known in English as the Commonwealth Realm, are said to be the 16 universal nations of the Commonwealth of Nations, ruled by the same ruler, Queen Elizabeth II
 ye saare desh ek hi rajasatta, shaasha, rajpariwaar or uttaradhikaar kram ko saanjhaa karte hai
 The system began with the Statute of Westminster of 1931, by which the then Dominion of Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were granted equal or complete legal independence with equal members of the British Commonwealth
 She had gone
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad se, vishwa bhar main vistrut, british samrajya ke tamaam deshon ko ek dominian ke rup main swadhinata pradaan kar di gayi
 Some of which, despite being completely independent, maintained their loyalty to the monarchy, while some states refused to consider the British monarchy as the nominal head and declared themselves a republican state
 aaj, vishwa baahar main kul 16 aise rajya hai jo swayan ko maharani elizabeth dwitiya ke ek prajabhumi ke rup main pahchaan karavvate hai
 Under the British sovereign in the English language, these states are commonly known as Rialm, which is derived from the French word royum, a realme, a state, territory or territory over which a king / queen rules
 yahan yah jaananaa aavashyak he kii, united kingdom yaa rashtramandal yaa kisi bhi rashtramandal pradesh kii aadhikarik shabdaawalee main "realm" ek vaidhik yaa kanoonee shabd nahin he, arthath "realm" kii koi kanoonee paribhaasha nahin he
 Therefore, there is no obligation that these states under the British sovereign be addressed by any special name, nor does the term "realm" define any particular status of a state
 haalaanki, 1950 ke dashak se hi, british samprabhu ke raaj ke adheen aanevaale rajyon ko rashtramandal ke anya sadsy deshon se vibhakt rup se bodh karne hetu "realm" shabd kaa upyog adhikaarak dastavezon main kiya jaataa rahaa he, yahan tak kii rani elizabeth ke rajasidhaaran kii ghoshnaa main bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These states are called realms because, despite being under the same ruler, all these states are completely universal, and completely independent from each other, so it is not part of 16 countries, one political unit, but 16 There are different states
 kyonki, reyalm ek kanoonee shabd nahin he, isiilie iskaa koi aadhikarik anuwaad bhi upasthit nahin he
 Therefore, to understand these states, any word that makes sense of the land under a king can be used
 saadhaaran taurapar, prajabhumi, pradesh, or paribhumi jaise shabdon kaa prayog hota he, inke alaava, pramandal or rajbhumi shabdon kaabhi upyog ho saktaa he
 According to the present situation, since the year 1992, there are a total of 16 Commonwealth tribes in the world, with a total area of 1,87,00,000 square kilometers, and a population of 14,30,00,000
 jisame se 6 sabase adhik aabaad desh hai:united kingdom, canda, australia, newzealand or jamaica
 The system of Rajmukut or The Crown is a special political concept, which has a very important role in the legal and political system of Britain and other Commonwealth territories
 is soch kaa vikaas england rajya main samantvaadi kaal ke dauraan shabdic mukut tathaa rashtriya sampadaaon ko samprabhu tathaa unke / unki vyaktigat sampatti se vibhakt kar sambodhit karne hetu hua tha
 According to this view, the Rajmukut is seen as a symbol of state and governance in all aspects of administration and in every dimension, and the British sovereign is seen as a continuous incarnation of the Rajmukut
 atah britain tathaa rashtramandal pradeshon me is shabdaawalee ko shashan athwa sarkaar ke liye ek upalakshan ke rup main bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, yaa sidhe-sidhe aisa bhi kaha ja saktaa he kii yah rajtantr ko hi sambodhit karne kaa ek doosraa tarika he
 Legally, "rajmukut" can be defined as an individual institution which is the entire judicial embodiment of the legislature, executive and judiciary
 atah is sandarbh main is shabd ko kisi shahi poshaak ke vaastavik mukut ke saath sambhramit nahin karnaa chahie
 As an institution, the Rajmukut is the oldest functioning institution in Britain's political system
 prayek rashtramandal pradesh main rajmukut kii sankalpana saamaan, parantu vibhakt vidhik sankalpanaayen hai
 Therefore, in Commonwealth law, judicial documents to distinguish one jurisdiction from another, "crown the right 


" Example: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom 


" or "la Couronne du chef du Québec "also holds the Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, etc
, and because Canada and Australia are federal nations, each Canadian province and Australian state" Rajmukut "
 mukut ke adhikaron ko yaa adhirat dwaara swayan yaa phir unke pratinidhi dwaara, sambandhit mantriyon yaa adhikariyon kii salaah par prayog kiya jaataa he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions, including the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701 and the Act of Union, 1707
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament
 antim baar jab kisi shaasha ko anaichhik rup se nishkashit kiya gaya tha, wo tha 1688 main james saptam or dwitiya jinhen glorious revolution ke samay nishkashit kiya gaya tha
 The Act of Settlement, 1701, limits the succession to the legally Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I
 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 According to the Acts of Settlement of 1701, only the "legitimate" Protostant descendants of Sophia, the granddaughter of James I, the granddaughter of Hanover, were able to inherit the throne
 arthath, shahi parivaar ke vansh ke keval jaays santan hi singhasana par uttaradhikaar kaa haq rakhte hai, or koi bhi avaidh santan, tathaa unke vanshaj, singhasana par kisi bhi prakaar kaa adhikaar nahin rakhte hai
 In this context, according to the provisions of the Royal Marriage Act, 1772, any member of the royal family is required to obtain the sovereign's approval to marry, and any marriage done without the sovereign's approval shall be deemed "illegal", and The person and his children will be deprived of authority over the throne
 is adhinium ke praavdhaanon main 2013 ke saxeshan tu da crown act dwaara kuch parivartan laaye gaye
 According to the Act, the first six members of the succession order are required to obtain sovereign permission to marry, otherwise the person and all the progeny and descendants of that marriage will be deemed to be deprived of the succession order
 parantu aisi kisi bhi vivaah ko kisi bhi prakaar se gaiyr-kanoonee nahin qaraar ja saktaa he
 The group of the closest members of the sovereign's family is called the royal family
 haalaanki, aisa koi drudh niyam yaa vidhaan nahin he, jo yah suniyojit karata ho kii kin vyaktiyon ko is vishesh samooh main rakhaa jaae, naahi koi aisa vidhaan he jo rajpariwaar ko vistrut rup se paribhaashit karata ho
 Nonetheless, those individuals to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness are generally referred to are members of the royal family
 is maapdand ke aadhaar par raaj parivaar main, adhirat, unke / unki sahachaari, purv samprabhu kii vidhwaa / vidhurgan, wales ke rajkumaar ke jyeshthatam putr ke santan, tathaa purv shaasha ke putron kii dharmapatniyaan yaa unki vidhwaayen or unke purush-rekha ke pautra shaamil honge
 In the context of different Commonwealth territories, different terminology can also be used for this particular group, for example, in Australia this group is called the Australian Royal Family and in Canada the Canadian Royal Family
 18 veen or 19veen sadi ke dauraan britain ke aupniveshik vistaar dwaara, britain ne vishwa ke anya anek bhu-bhaagon ve kshetron par apana kabza jamaa liya

 haalaanki un sabhi deshon ne united kingdom kii sarkaar kii adhipatyata ko nakaar diya, parantu unamem se kai raashtra, british shaasha ko apane adhirat ke rup main manyata dete hai
 These countries are called Commonwealth Territories or Commonwealth Praja Bhumi
 varttman kaal main, united kingdom ke adhirat keval united kingdom ke hi nahin balki uske atirikt kul 15 anya rashtron ke adhirat bhi hai
 Although in these nations also they have almost the same rank and authority as in Britain, but in those countries, they have no real political or traditional duties, almost all the duties of the ruler as their representative fulfills the General Manager of that country
 
 britain kii sarkaar kaa rashtramandal pradeshon kii sarkaron ke kaary main koi bhi bhoomika yaa hastkshep nahin he
 Commonwealth countries other than Britain: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, St

 purvatah rashtron ke rashtramandal ke saare desh rashtramandal paribhumi ke hissaa hua karte the, parantu 1950 main bharat ne swatantraaa ke pashchaat swayan ko ganraajya ghoshit kiya, or british rajasatta kii rashtrapramukh ke rup main samprabhutaa ko bhi khatm kar diya
 But India retained the membership of the Commonwealth
 uske baad se, rashtramandal deshon main, british samprabhu ko "rashtramandal ke pramukh" kaa pad bhi diya jaataa he, jo rashtramandal ke sanghathan kaa nammaatr pramukh kaa pad he

 Pitamah Bhishma, Dronacharya and Karna themselves also studied archery from Parashurama

 Under political philosophy, questions related to topics related to politics, freedom, justice, property, rights, law and power, enforcement of law, etc
 are: what are these, why are they needed, which thing is 'legitimate' to the government Makes, what rights and freedoms it is the duty of the government to protect, what is the law, what are the duties of citizens towards a legitimate government, when It is lawful etc
 to overthrow the government

 Different aspects of politics are studied under political theory
 raajnneeti kaa sambandh manushyon ke saarvajanik jivan se hai
 In traditional studies, thinking was the predominance of the method of thinking in which not all the elements are monitored, but on the basis of reasoning power, all its possible aspects, mutual relations effects and consequences are considered
 'siddhanth' kaa arth he tarkpurna dhang se sanchit or vishleshit gyaan kaa samooh
 Politics is concerned with many things, including the relationship between individuals and groups and classes and the state, and the institutions of the state like judiciary, bureaucracy etc
 raajnneetik siddhanth kii paribhaasha karte hue david veld kehete hai- Political theory according to Andrew Hacker's definition - guld or colb ne raajnneetik siddhanth kii ek vyapak paribhaasha karte hue kaha he ki 'raajnneetik siddhanth raajnneeti vigyaan kaa ek up-kshetra’ he, ‘jisamen nimnlikhit kaa samavesh haih We can conclude that political theory is basically concerned with the mobilization of the state in both philosophical and empirical terms
 rajya tathaa raajnneetik sansthaaon ke bare main spashtikaran dene, unka varnan karne or unke sambandh main shreyaskar suzav dene kii koshish kii jaati he
 Of course, the study of moral philosophical purpose is embedded in it
 chintak vinstin ne gaagar main sagar bharte hue kaha tha ki raajnneetik siddhanth mukhyatah ek aisi sankriya he jisamen prashn puche jate hai, un prashnon ke uttaron kaa vikaas kiya jaataa he or maanav praaniyon ke saarvajanik jivan ke sambandh main kaalpanik pariprekshyon kii rachana kii jaati he
 The questions that are asked are as follows: What is the nature and purpose of the state? How do we decide the goals, goals and methods of political organization? What is and should be the relationship between the state and the individual? Throughout history, political theory has been answering these questions
 ise isliye mahatvapurn mana gaya he kyonki manushya kaa bhagya is baat par nirbhar hota he ki shaskaon or shasiton ko kis prakaar kii pranali praapt ho paati he or jo pranali praapt hoti he uske falswaroop kya saamaanya bhalaai ke liye sanyukt kaarywahi kii jaati he
 Philosophy consists of all the thinking on any subject in search of truth and knowledge
 jab vah khoj raajnneetik vishyon par hoti he tab use ham raajnneetik darshan kehete hai
 Therefore, there is no need to propose any theory in it and this is the difference between political philosophy and political theory
 is prakaar raajnneetik siddhanth raajnneetik darshan kaa hissaa he, lekin raajnneetik darshan adhikanshtah kaaphi adhik vyapak hota he or aavashyak nahin ki usamen koi siddhanth shaamil ho
 Thus we can say that the questions related to political philosophy state, government, politics, freedom, justice, property, rights, law and the enforcement of legal code by any authority, etc
, ie what are they? If they are needed then why? What things legitimize a government, what rights and freedoms it should protect and why and what form it should take and why the law is and what it is and the duty of citizens towards a legitimate government, if any What are the questions and when will the overthrow of a government be valid or not? ‘raajnneetik darshan’ se bahudhaa hamaara taatpary raajnneeti ke prati saamaanya drushtikon yaa uske sambandh main vishisht naitikta athwa vishwaas yaa rukh se hota he or yah sab jaruri taur par darshan ke sampurna takneekee vishay ke antargat nahin aata he
 Political philosophy is often concerned not with contemporary questions, but more universal questions of the political life of man
 lekin raajnneetik siddhantkaar kii drushti mukhya rup se samakaleen raajnneetik jivan par hoti he or yadhyapi rajya ke swaroop or prayojan or isi prakaar ke saamaanya prashnon kii vyakhya karne main vah dilchaspee letaa he tathaapi vah raajnneetik vyavhaar, rajya tathaa nagarikon ke bich ke vaastavik sambandh or samaaj main shakti kii bhoomika ke yathaarthon kaa varnan karne or unhen samajhane kii bhi koshish kar rahaa hota he
 While studying political science we feel that we should supplement political theory with the study of political philosophy otherwise it seems barren and irrelevant
 raajnneetik siddhanth ko kabhi-kabhi raajnneetik chintan ke paryaay ke rup main dekha jaataa he, lekin yah samaj lenaa jaruri he ki unka arth aavashyak rup se ek hi nahin hota
 Political thought is a generalized phrase that incorporates all the thoughts, principles and values of an individual or group of people or community on questions related to the state and the state
 jab koi vyaktiμchaahe vah professor, patrkaar, lekhak, kavi, upanyaaskaar aadi jo bhi ho yaa beshak vah raajnneetijna hi hoμaise vichaar vyakt karata he jinka hamaare jivan se sarokaar he or jo vichaar rajya or shashan tathaa inase sambandhit prashnon ke bare main hai tab vah vastutah raajnneetik chintan kar rahaa hota he
 Principles may or may not be included in his thoughts
 un vichaaron main tab koi siddhanth nihit nahin hoga jab un main rajya or shashan aadi ke raajnneetik niyam se sambandhit aitihaasik tathaa raajnneetik sanghatana kii vyakhya karne ke liye prastut kii gai koi vyavasthit or tarksmmat prakkalpana na ho
 In this way, political thinking is always the general idea of a person or a group politically, whereas a political theory is an explanation or idea or principle in itself and standing on its own, in which to answer questions, to interpret history
 And an attempt is made to forecast future possible events
 beshak, yah siddhanth hameshaa kisi ek chintak vyakti kii sristi hota he
 Barker had said that political thought is the inward philosophy of an entire era, but political theory is the thinking of one person
 raajnneeti vigyaan adhyayan kaa ek vistrut vishay yaa kshetra he or raajnneetik siddhanth uskaa ek up -kshetra bhar he
 Political science includes all these things: political thought, political theory, political philosophy, political ideology, institutional or structural framework, comparative politics, public administration, international law and organization etc
 kuch chintakon ne raajnneeti vigyaan ke vigyaan paksh par bal diya he
 He says that when political science is studied as a science through scientific methods, then political theory cannot be considered political science to the extent it is a part of political philosophy, because in political science, then, the abstract and intuitive There is no place for conclusions or thoughts arising out of it, but political philosophy should be filled with the same inexact methods

 raajnneetik siddhanth na to shuddh chintan he, na shuddh darshan or na shuddh vigyaan
 The questions that have been important in political theory have changed over time
 clasiki or praarambhik raajnneetik siddhanth kaa sarokaar naitik drushti se dosha-rahit raajnneetik vyavastha kii talash se tha or usne vishesh dhyaan rajya ke swaroop or prayojan, raajnneetik satta ke upyog ke aadhaar or raajnneetik avagya kii samasya se prashnon par diya
 The rise of modern nation states and the changes in the economic structure and the industrial revolution led to new priorities and the center of attention became individualism and freedom of the individual and its relationship with society and the state
 adhikaar, karttavya, swatantraaa, samanta or sampatti jaise prashn adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye
 Gradually, the interpretation of the relation of others with a concept such as freedom and equality, justice and liberty, or the relation between equality and property: also became important
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad ek nae prakaar ke anubhavik raajnneetik siddhanth kaa udai hua
 It tried to study the political behavior of man and draw theoretical conclusions on the basis of it
 maanav-vyavhaaron kaa adhyayan karne vaale vidwaanon ne adhyayan ke liye nae prashnon ko saamne rakhaa
 He often borrowed such questions from other branches of the genre
 inamen se kuch prashn is prakaar hai- Over the past few decades many other issues have emerged - such as identity, gender, environmentalism, ecology, community, etc
 saath hi mulya-aadhaarit raajnneetik siddhanth kaa bhi punaroday hua he, jisamen swatantraaa, samanta or nyaay ke prashnon par nae dhang se jor diya gaya he
 We as human beings live together as social beings, in which we partner in resources, jobs and rewards
 saath hi ham vyakti bhi hai, jis haisiyat main hamen kuch buniyadi maanavadhikaron kii jarurat he
 Therefore, the process of organization of the state and society becomes important for the sake of bringing harmony and prosperity to the maximum extent and to provide favorable conditions for personal self-improvement
 faltah maanav samaajon kii ekta or akhandta kaa yaa samaaj kii samuhik aavashyaktaaon kii purti kaa maarg prashast karne ke liye raajnneetik siddhanth mahatvapurn ho jaataa he, kyonki vah samasyaon kaa adhyayan karne or us prakriya main unka samaadhaan foundne kii koshish karata he
 The relevance of political theory in developing different perspectives on the nature and purpose of the state, in relation to the basis of political power and the most credible form of government, and in relation to the basic rights of the state and the individual
 Contains
 iske atirikt, raajnneetik siddhanth raajnneetik rajya kii naitik gunvattta kii parakh ke liye naitik maapdand sthapit karne tathaa vaikalpik raajnneetik prabandhan or vyavhaar sujhane kaa bhi praytn karata he

 The alternator is an alternating current generating generator

 At present, power generation is done by alternators in most power plants
 samay ke saath saath bahut bade bade aakaar ke alternetr banane lagate hai
 Generators with a capacity of 50,000 to 1,50,000 kw are now common
 ye nirantar pravartan karanevaali mashine hai, isliye inaki sanrachana bhi atyant maanak aadhaar par hoti he
 Primarily, it is an automatic working machine and all its enforcement can be controlled by remote control
 kshetra dhara ke vicharan se voltata niyantran sugamawa se kiya ja saktaa he
 The investment is controlled by the load itself
 in sab kaarnon se vartmaan vidyut janitr bahut hi daksh evam vishwasaneey hote hai
 In fact, due to their reliable enforcement, it has been possible to make the electric current reliable
 jaise jaise vidyut kaa prayog badhata gaya, janitron kaa aakaar evam janit voltata main bhi vruddhi hoti gai
 But in the direct generators, it was not possible to greatly increase its size due to rotating armature
 isliye ucch voltata janit karanevaale prayavarti dhara ke janitr banaae gaye, jinamein armechar swaitik tha or kshetra paribhramanshil
 In fact, voltage generation does not require the conductor to move in a magnetic field
 ghoomte hue chumbakeey kshetra main sthit chaalak main bhi voltata prerit hogi, kyonki is dasha main bhi vah chumbakeey abhivah ko kaat rahaa he
 Hence, on this theory, the voltage can be generated by the static armature and the field of rotation

 armechar ke sthitik hone ke kaaran or baahar kii ore hone se, uskaa aakaar kaaphi badhaayaa ja saktaa he, jiskaa matlab he, usamen chaalak sankhya kaaphi adhik ho sakati he
 The field windings are relatively small and rotating at high velocity does not, in practice, pose any difficulty
 in kaarnon se prayavarti dhara janitron main ucch voltata janit karnaa sambhav he or ye saadharantaya 11,000 volt par pravartit kiye jate hai
 These generators have serpent rings in place of burush, which carry currents to excite the field coil
 kshetra ke paribhramanshil hone ke kaaran unhen disht dhara dwaara uttejan karnaa aavashyak he
 The excitation current is obtained either from an external source, or from a small direct current generator mounted on the same shaft, called the exciter
 uttejan voltata saadharantaya 110 athwa 220 volt hi hoti he
 All large generators are fed by the exciter so that no separate direct current source is required for the exciter
 prayavarti dhara janitron ko nirdhaarit veg par hi pravartan karnaa hota he, jo unamem janit voltata kii aavriti evam kshetra dhruvon kii sankhya par nirbhar karata he
 This can be expressed by the following equation: yahan n=parikraman prati minute, f=aavriti tathaa p=dhruv sankhya
 Thus, a four-polar machine for 50 cyclic frequency will act with a velocity of 1,500 revolutions per minute and a two-polar machine with a velocity of 3,000 revolutions per minute
 yadi nirdhaarit veg ek samaan rahaa, to aavriti main antar aa jayega
 In general, electric currents are of a specified voltage and frequency
 at: aavriti sthir rakhane ke liye janitr kaa veg eksaa na rakhana aavashyak he or yah veg uski dhruvasankhya ke anusaar nishchit hota he
 In India and other Commonwealth countries, the frequency of electrocution is generally fixed at 50 cycles per second
 america tathaa duusare deshon main 60 chakree aavriti prayog kii jaati he
 The velocity of the generators of different poles is also determined according to frequency, which is called synchronous velocity
 uparyukt aadhaar par, veg ke anusaar in janitron ke do mukhya praroop hote hai : ek to terbojanitr, jinhen vaashp tarabine se chalaaya jaataa he or ucch veg par pravartit karte hai tathaa duusare jalavidyut janitr, jo saamanyat: kam veg par pravartit kiye jate hai
 The velocity of some is up to 125 revolutions per minute
 inamen 50 chakree aavriti ke liye 48 dhruv hote hai
 The polarizer does not have more than 2 or 4 pole numbers
 bade janitron main keval 2 dhruv hi hote hai or ve 3,000 parikraman prati minute par pravartan karte hai
 Along with this difference, their composition also varies a lot
 adhik dhruvovali mashin kaa roter kaaphi bada hota he
 Its composition is similar to a conductive wheel, which is mounted on the spokes like a cycle wheel from the central part and the poles are all around in circularity
 ise salient dhruv vaala roter kehete hai
 In contrast, the rotor of a turbo generator is very long and cylindrical
 isamen dhruv nikle hue nahin hote, varan belanaakaar roter main bane khaanchon main avasthit kshetra kundaliyon dwaara banate hai
 This type of rotor is called cylindrical rotor or smooth rotor according to the shape
 terbojanitr ke ucch veg par pravartit karne ke kaaran, inamen vering ke snehan or sanvathan kii samasyaayen atyant mahatvapurn hoti hai
 Due to the heavy load on the bearings in hydroelectric generators and the application of lateral forces, the lubrication problem is complicated, but the ventilation itself becomes sufficient
 snehan ke liye tel pump dwaara tel chalanshil bhaagon main, jahaan snehan aavashyak hota he, daab ke saath bheja jaataa he
 The oil filter is also an essential accessory to clean oil
 snehan daab ghat jane par, mashin ke sakriy rup se band ho jane kii bhi vyavastha hoti he
 In turbogenerators, aeration is often used for ventilation
 armechar or roter main vahiniyaan is prakaar bani hoti he ki ek ore se hawa khinchakar in vahiniyon main hoti hui or mashin ko thandha karti hui duusari ore ko nikal jaati he
 This action is supported at high velocity, but in large generators it is not naturally ventilated enough and air is sent into the machine by pressure
 dhul or nami se mashin ko bachaane ke liye, sanvaahan kaa band tantra prayukt hota he
 In this, the same air is used repeatedly and when heated, it is cooled by an aerator and then sent to the machine for ventilation with pressure
 bade janitron main sanvathan ke liye vaayu ke sthaan par hydrogen gas kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Hydrogen is 14 times lighter than air
 at:, sanvathan ke liye ise prayog karne se vivy haani kam ho jaati he
 It is also a more effective medium of heat removal than air
 parantu vaayu ke saath milakar hydrogen visphotak ho saktaa he or ise bachaane ke liye paryaapt saavdhaanee rakhi jaati he
 Auto Fon Botlink was an indo-german scholar and a Sanskrit scholar who after studying the Sanskrit literature methodically, published a large dictionary called 'sanskrit Wartherbukh' in seven parts after years of hard work
 yah aaj bhi adwitiya granth he
 Batalink was born on 30 May 1815 in the city of Leningrad, Russia
 berlin tathaa bon main unhone ucch shiksha praapt kii
 Bonn was a major center of Sanskrit in Europe at that time
 berlin main francis bop naamak sanskrit vidvan bhi inke guru the
 The impact of interaction and atmosphere with scholars gave a new twist to his study
 yadhyapi aarambh se vishvavidhyalay main inkaa vishay arabi tathaa farsi tha, tathaapi yah sanskrit kii ore jhuke or aage chalakar isi vishay ko lekar inhen vishwakhyati mili
 In 1840, he wrote a book called 'grammer Sanskrit' which was based on Panini's 'ashtadhyayi'
 1843 main isi vishay ko lekar inkaa vistrut granth 'panini grametic' prakashit hua jisamen sutron par saral german bhashaa main tikaa kii gai he
 One of his works was published in French under the name 'desertesian Sir la Accent Sanskrit' and then the translation of Shakuntal of Kalidasa in German came out with the original
 1811 main 'christromathiye sanskrit' naamak granth prakashit hua
 His 'sanskrit Warterbukh' is an attempt at hard work from 1852 to 75
 isamen inkaa haath roth tathaa webar ne bantaya tha
 Each word has been fully explained in this book and has been mentioned throughout Sanskrit literature wherever it is mentioned
 isse mul granthon main unako saralata se dhunda ja saktaa he
 In 1904, the scholar died in Leipzig, Germany
 gati or twaran kaa avrodh karne ke liye mukhya yantra ke saath jo upayantra lagaaya jaataa he, use hi rodhak yaa brake kehete hai
 By employing natural forces in mechanics, achieving the desired kind of speed and acceleration, the work of more importance than taking useful work from it is to intercept their speed and acceleration properly at the desired time
 sahi kaam karne kii drushti se or rajkeey niyamon ke anusaar suraksha kii drushti se bhi, prayek chalanevaale yantra ke saath brake kaa hona aavashyak he
 Many types of mechanical and natural forces are also used to activate the blocking device and many types of mechanical applications are also used in these devices
 in bhinnataaon ke kaaran brikon kaa vargeekaran nimnlikhit teen kotiyon main kiya jaataa he : Strap Brake: It has a flexible strap, abrasion due to friction by tightening the brake drum
 gutka brake : isamen vrutt-khandaakaar gutke, liveron ke sahare se latakaakar, pahie yaa dhol kii paridhi ke sampark main laae jate hai
 Axial brake: The brakes which are applied on the main axle or its parallel parts in lieu of wheels or drums are called axial brakes
 inhen ke anya naam baariya brake, suraksha, swachal or yantric brake bhi hai
 They are designed in such a way that the speed of the deceleration is proportional to the force on the axle, as in electric and hand operated cranes
 jab bijli kii chaalak shakti, athwa haath kaa bal, aksmaat nirbal pad jaay, to is prakaar ke brake ke dwaara latakta hua bojha vahiin kaa vahiin ruk jaataa he
 For this reason, this brake is called automatic, but it is not the type of automatic brake that is used automatically in trains
 lagbhag sabhi prakaar ke brikon main gatyavrodh kaa kaaran dhol, pahie, athwa dhure aadi, ke saath honevaala gharshan hi he, lekin silinder or piston kii shakti se chalanevaale ingine or yantron main yadi piston kii duusari taraf bhi kaaryakari madhyam, yatha vaashp, yaa sampidit hawa, yaa gas, pahunchaa diya jaae, tab bhi us yantra kii gati kaa avarodhan ho jaataa he
 Such a brake is called frictionless brake
 gatyaatmak brikon kii ginati bhi isi koti main hoti he, udhaahrant: yantra ko gati denevaale bijli ke motor ko kuch kshanon ke liye yadi dianamo main parivartit kar diya jaae, to chaalit yantra kii gati kaa avrodh ho jaataa he
 They are used to stop and stop the speed of electric motors driving cranes and other types of equipment
 yah mukhyatya do prakaar ke hote hai : These include controlling the friction generating parts by electromagnets
 antat: ye brake bhi yantric kriya dwaara kaary karte hai
 These too are of three types according to the design, viz
, Gutka, patched and chakali
 brake kaa dhol kisi bhi disha main chale, gutkon dwaara badi sthirataa se uskaa gatyavrodh hota he
 Stretched brakes tend to require less power than gutted brakes, but this results in movement in one direction and weakening in the other direction
 chakliyukt brake main gharshan chakliyaan, dhure par lagi chakaliyon se ragad khaati hai, jo kamanion kii takat se dabaai jaati hai, lekin unhen chhudaane ke liye parinalika kii chumbakeey shakti kaa upyog karnaa hota he
 This brake makes its impact when moving in both directions and is also more reliable
 pattayukt brikon main saadhaaran upyog ke samay to chumbak kaa bhaar hi kaam karata he or unhen chhudaane ke liye chumbak kaa khichaav
 If this type of brake is used to lift and back the bridges that are open and closed, then the entire brake device itself becomes sloping as the bridge is changed
 aisi haalat main keval chumbak kaa bhaar brikon ko pakadaney kii shakti dene main asamarth rahata he
 Hence, the commanders also have to be used along with it
 brake ke liye chumbak or uski kundaliyaan: jahaan disht dhara kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, vahaan chakliyukt brikon main parinalika prakaar kaa or pattayukt tathaa gutke yukt brikon main ashwanalanuma chumbak kaa, upyog hota he, lekin jahaan patyavarti dhara prayukt hoti he vahaan sab prakaar ke brikon main parinalika chumbak kaa hi praaia: upyog hota he
 But the core of that solenoid has to be layered
 disht dhara ke chumbak kaa kundalikaran niyantrak yantra kii banaavat ke aavashyaktaanusaar shrenee main, athwa parshvavahi rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Often both the motor and the brake are powered by the same controlling device
 at: aisa prabandh kiya jaataa he ki jyon hi chaalak motor ko shakti dena band kiya jaae, tyon hi brikon main shakti kaa aavesh hokar brake swat: hi lag jaaen or jab motor ko pun: shakti di jaae to brake swat: hi chhut jaaen
 In such a scheme, the coils are placed in the category
 jahaan prayaavart dhara kaa upyog hota he vahaan chumbakeey kundaliyaan sadaiv parshvavahi paddati ke anusaar lagaai jaati hai
 The capacity of the solenoid brake is always expressed in terms of the force used in stopping the load and slowing down the speed
 gananaa karte samay purna bhaar vahan karne ke nimitt chaalak motor main jo balaghurna hota he, uskaa yah kuch pratishat ansh rup main liya jaataa he, jiskaa sutara nimna prakaar he: It has been observed from experience that for acceleration, it is 20 to 200% of the total load strength
 jahaan kraine aadi main puure bhaar ko ek dam bich main hi lakatataa hua rokna hota he, vahaan 100% se 200% tak balaghurna laga dena hota he
 20 to 25% of the force is applied in the printing equipment, where there is a fear of a burst of paper and up to 50% in traffic vehicles
 jab kisi dishtdhaara ke parshv kundaliyukt motor uttejit rahata he, usee samay yadi use kisi anya chaalak madhyam dwaara chalit rakhaa jaae, jaise usee ke armechar ke samveg athwa usase sambandhit anya yantron ke samveg dwaara, to vah motor us samay dianamo kaa kaam karne lagata he, kyonki us samay motor kaa dhaatra mukhya shaktistrot se asambaddha hokar dharaniyantrak se sambandhit ho jaataa he, jisase vah motor kii gati kaa avrodh usee prakaar karne lagata he jis prakaar dynamo apane chaalak ingine kii gati kaa avrodh karata he
 When this type of work is taken from the motors of the alternating current, then its wires are connected in the same way as the inverse dynamo
 praaia: prerak motor kaa uttejan nimna voltata kii dishtdhaara se kiya jaataa he or roter ko dhara niyantrak se sambhddha kar dete hai
 By doing this, the speed of the motor is controlled by the amount of resistance in the current controller, as is used in the direction
 gatyaatmak punaryoji pranali ke brikon ke lagate samay jo yantric urja kaa shoshan hota he, vah dhara niyantrak main nasht ho jane ke badale sthir voltiy pranali ko waapas laut jaataa he
 In this system, any type of current can be used, either direct or reverse
 kai brake yantron main gatyaatmak or punaryoji, donon hi prakaar kaa pranaaliyon kaa mishrit upyog hota he
 Brakes, both purely mechanical brakes and hydraulic brakes, are used in motor vehicles
 isamen liveron ko drum kii paridhi par dabaane ke liye cam ke badale ek dumuha silinder laga rahata he, jisamen donon ore do piston lage hote hai
 The main cylinder producing fluid pressure and transmission is located near the engine, in which the mixture of egg oil and ether etc
 is fully filled
 yah badi majboot tathaa lacheelee naliyon dwaara uparyukt drum ke silinderon main ek chota piston usamen bhare drav ko dabaata he, lekin yah drav asampidya hone ke kaaran us daab ko drum main lage silinderon tak pareshit kar, uske pistano ko chalaakar liveron or paridhi ke bich gharshan dwaara gatyavrodh karata he
 The normal pressure of the foot generates pressures up to 100 pounds per square inch in cylinders and up to 350 pounds per square inch when pressed more forcefully when needed
 tram gadiyon main haath ke bal se, sampidit vaayu ke bal se or vidyucchalit teen prakaar ke brake lagaae jate hai
 The brakes applied to the engines and to each vehicle are compressed vapor, air, or vacuum or hand powered
 sampidit hawa tathaa nirvaat ke kaaran chalanevaale brake swayanchalit hote hai, jo railgadiyon ke vafer sanyojakon ke tut jane yaa asambandhit ho jane par, jab train ke do bhaag ho jate hai, swat: hi sab vaahanon main lagaakar train khandon ko roak dete hai
 Every engine and trapezoid wagons and special types of riding compartments must have hand brakes, so that, in the absence of engine power, they must be stopped at the desired location in the yard and are not rolled due to shields or air vents
 
 injanon or unke saath laganevaali koyale or pani kii tankiyon main haath ke atirikt vashpachaalit brake bhi lagaaya jaataa he, jiske brake silinder main jaakar uske piston ko dabaate hai
 This allows the brake blocks to catch the wheels with the help of levers
 yah ingine sahit puri railgadee main kaam karata he
 If there is a steam engine to drive the train, an air compressor pump is run by the steam in its boiler and by the motor in the electric engine, with a pressure of 90 to 100 pounds per square inch in a large main tank on the engine
 The air is filled
 ingine ke peeche chalanevaali gadiyon main bhi ek ek choti sahaayak tank laga di jaati he, jisamen lagbhag 12 se 15 ghan foot tak sthaan rahata he
 When the engine train is burnt, the air buried in the engine's main tank is released into the train pipe, which fills the auxiliary tank through the pipe branches, but in the brake cylinders in the car, this air only Reaches when braking is necessary
 ingine main driver ke brake niyantrak valve ke nikat hi bharan valve laga hota he, jiske madhyam se gaadi ke chalane kii haalat main uski sab tank aadi main 70 pound prati varg inch ke lagbhag hawa kii daab bani rahati he
 Then the driver wants to brake at his own pace, or when there is a breakdown automatically when the brakes are automatically started, the air of the train pipe at some time, whether it is the brake valve of the driver or guard or any other route
 Ho, it starts venturing into the atmosphere, which causes the pistons of triple valves in all trains to slide as the air pressure of the train pipe decreases
 isse prayek gaadi kii tankiyon main bhari hui dabi hawa brake silinderon main jaakar unke pistano kii takat se sarka detii he, jisase liveron ke jariye brake gutke chakkon ko pakad lete hai
 To release the brakes, the pressurized air from the engine's main tank is again filled into the train pipe, causing the piston of the triple valves to return to their old positions as pressure increases
 isse brake silinderon main bhari dabi hawa kaa maarg tripal valve ke madhyam se vayumandal main khul jaataa he or brake chhot jate hai
 Each vehicle in a vacuum brake is fitted with a cylinder, in which a sliding polo piston divides it into two airtight parts
 jis samay gaadiyaan bekaar khadi hoti hai, us samay silinder main piston main donon taraf saadhaaran hawa bhari rahati he or piston apane bojhe se neeche kii taraf baitha rahata he
 When the trains are plowed into the engine, through train pipes, all those cylinders are connected to the engineered ventilator, and with the help of boiler's steam current, the device will wind the train pipes of the overall trains and their respective cylinders
 By throwing them out by suction action, vacuuming them up to 22 inches
 nirvathan ke samay bhi piston ke donon or nirvaat ho jane ke kaaran, vah yathapurv apane bojhe se neeche hi baitha rahata he
 When braking, the driver through his valve, or guard his valve, Or passengers pulling chains; a small valve enters the air in the train pipe
 isse vah pipe kii shakhaon main se hoti hui brake silinderon main pistano ke neeche kii ore pahunch jaati he
 On its way to the top, a round valve is fitted, which is closed by the pressure of the air and the piston remains vacuum upwards due to the non-ventilation
 at: neeche se vayumandal kii hawa use upar uthaa detii he, jisase piston dand se sambandhit brake gutkon ke chakkon ko pakad lete hai
 When the brake is vacuumed again to release, when the air under the piston is released, due to the slight pressure on either side of the piston, it settles down with its burden and the brakes are released

 Aitareya Upanishad is a Shukla Rigvedic Upanishad
 rigvedic aitarey aaranyak ke antargat dwitiya aaranyak ke adhyay 4, 5 or 6
 kaa naam aitareyopanishad he
 This Upanishad is Brahmavidyapradhan
 bhagavan shankaracharya iske upar jo bhashya likhaa he vah bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 In its upbringing, he decides for salvation and after annihilating karma and unproven knowledge, he only gives knowledge as his only means
 phir gyaanake adhikaar kaa nirnay kiya he or bade samaaroh ke saath karmkandi ke adhikaar kaa niraakaran karte hue sanyasi ko hi uskaa adhikari tehraaya he
 There they say that 'grihasthashram' is the name of the accession of its home special and it can only happen while the desires are there and there is a complete lack of desires in the knowledgeable
 isliye yadi kisiprakaar chittashuddhi ho jane se kisi ko grihasthashram main hi gyaan ho jaay to bhi kamnashunya ho jane se apane grihavishesh ke parigrah kaa abhaav ho jane ke kaaran use swatah hi bhikshukatv kii prapti ho jaaygi
 Acharya is of the opinion that 'yavajjivamagnihotram Juhoti' etc
 Sruti are only for the ignorant, no such method can be done for Bodhwan
 is prakaar vidvan ke liye paariwrajya kii anivaaryta dikhalaakar ve jigyaasu ke liye bhi unki avashyakrtavyata kaa vidhaan karte he
 For this, he has quoted 'shanta danta upartastishtu:' Atishrambhimya: Param prabham prawach samyagrishisanghajushtam '' Karmana na prajaya dhanen tyagainaike amritatvamanushu '' etc
 Shruti and 'gyatva naishkaryamacharathe' 'brahmashramapade vassate etc
 brahmajigyaasu brahmacharee ke liye bhi chaturthashramaka vidhaan karte hue acharya kehete hai ki uske vishay main yah shankaa nahin kii ja sakati ki use rintray kii nivritti kiye bina sanyas kaa adhikaar nahin hai; kyonki grihasthashramako sweekaar karne se purv to uskaa rini hona hi sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, the principle of Acharya is that anyone who has the curiosity of self-interest and who wants to be free from the eternal world, should be in any ashram, he should accept the world
 is siddhanth ke mukhya aadhaar do hi hai- Therefore, to acquire the wealth of knowledge and wealth and lack of desires - these are for the main purpose of homicide
 jo log ghar main rahete hue hi shamdamadi sadhansmpann ho sakate hai or jin bodhwanon kii nishkamtamen apane grihavishesh main rahanaa baadhak nahin hota ve ghar main rahete hue bhi gyanoparjan or gyanaraksha kar hi sakate hai
 Despite not being a ascetic by nature, he is actually going to follow Acharya's opinion due to his asceticism

 There are three chapters in this Upanishad
 unamem se pehle adhyay main teen khand hai tathaa duusare or tisare adhyyonmen keval ek-ek khand hai
 In the first chapter, it is told that there was only one soul at the beginning of creation, there was nothing else for it, it was a testament to folklore and by mere effort, it created the three worlds of Amba, Marichi and Die
 inhen rachakar us paramatmane unke liye lokapaloki rachana karneka vichaar kiya or jalse hi ek purush kii rachnaakar use avyavyukt kiya
 It was with the resolve of God that the great male sense ball and the god of senses were born
 jab ve indriyaadhishthata devtaa is mahasamudramen aaye to paramatmane unhen bhukh-pyaas se yukt kar diya
 Then he prayed that any such volume should be provided in which we can feed and eat
 paramatma ne unke liye gauka sharir prastut kiya, kintu unhone ‘yah hamaare liye paryaapt nahin hai ‘aisa kahkar use asweekaar kar diya
 The body of the horse was brought thereafter but that too was rejected
 ant main paramatma ne unke liye manushya kaa sharir laayaa
 Seeing him, all the gods approved him in one voice, and they all were placed in the form of speech, soul, eye, etc
 in his various components by the command of God
 phir unke liye annaki rachana kii gayi
 Seeing food, he started running
 devataaon ne use vaani praan chakshu evam shrotradi bhinn-bhinn kaarnon se grahan karnaa chaha; parantu ve isamen safal na hue
 In the end, they accepted him in the non-stop
 is prakaar yah sari sristi ho janaper paramatma ne vichaar kiya ki ab mujhe bhi isamen pravesh karnaa chaiye; kyonki mere bina yah sara prapanch akinchitkar hi he
 So he disintegrated the statue of the man and entered it by him
 is prakaar jeevabhavako praapt honaper uskaa bhutonke saath tadatmya ho jaataa hai
 When the Gurukripa realizes that he is interviewed in his all-pervasive pure form, he becomes 'indra' - 'indra' because of seeing him in an unconformed manner
 is prakaar ikshan se lekar paramatma ke praveshparint jo sristikram batalaaya gaya he, ise hi vidyaranyaswami ne ishwar sristi kaha he
 The world is enlightened: is aakhyayika main bahut-si vicitra baaten dekhi jaati hai
 In this way, nothing in Maya is ridiculous; However, Acharya's statement is that this is only economism
 iskaa abhipraay aatmbodh karaane main he
 It is said only to make the spirit unique
 Because the whole world is self-centered because of the soul's determination
 dwitiya aadhyatm ke armbh main isi prakaar upkram kar bhagwaan bhashyakaarane aatmatatvaka bada sundar or yuktiyukt vivechan kiya he
 This chapter describes the three stages of life, which is called 'awasath' in the first chapter, for the perfection of enlightened self for enlightenment
 jivake teen janm maane gayi hai- According to this sruti, the soul and the son are the impenetration of the father and the son; That is why the rebirth of the father has also been described as the third birth of the son
 vamdev rishi ne garbh main rahete hue hi apane bahut-se janmon kaa anubhav batalaaya tha or yah kaha jaataa tha ki main lohamay durgon ke samaan saikadon sharir main bandi rah chukaa hoon; kintu ab atmagyaan ho jane se main shyen pakshi ke samaan unka bhedan kar baahar nikal aayaa hoon
 Due to such knowledge, Vamdev Sage attained the eternal immortal status of dehpat
 atah aatma ko bhoot evam indriya aadi anatmaprapanchase sarvatha asang anubhav karnaa hi amartv-praptika ekmaatr saadhan he
 Thus, in the second chapter, the soul has been described as the only source of the supreme knowledge in the third chapter
 vahaan batalaaya he ki hriday man, sangyaan, aagyaan, vigyaan, medha, drushti, dhrut, mati, manisha, juti, smriti, sankalp, kratu, asu kaam evam vash-ye sab pragyan ke hi naam hai
 This knowledge is Brahma, Indra, Prajapati, all the Gods, the Westerners, and the Uvijjas, Svedaj Andajas and Jarayus, etc
 are all living things
 yahi hathi, ghode, manushya tathaa sampoorn sthavar jangam jagat he
 In this way, the whole world is situated in knowledge, it is inspired by knowledge and itself is also in the form of knowledge, and knowledge is the Brahman
 jo is prakaar jaanata he vah is lok se utkraman kar us paramadham main pahunch samast kaamanaayon ko praapt kar amar ho jaataa he
 Kavyadarsha is a well-known Sanskrit poetry book by Alankarashastracharya Dandi
 kavyadarsh ke pratham pariched main kavy ke teen bhed kiye gaye hai– gadhy, padya tathaa mishra
 
 gadhy pun: 'aakhyayika' or 'katha' sheershak do upabhedon main vibhajit he
 But no fundamental difference has been directed in the above symptoms
 kritikar ne sanskrit gadhy sahitya kii bhi chaar kotiyaan maani hai– 'sanskrit', 'praakrit', 'apbhransh' tathaa 'mishra'
 Two styles named 'vaidarbhi' and 'gaudi' and introduction of 10 qualities are also in this passage
 rachayita ne anupras ke bhed ginaakar unamem se prayek ke lakshan evam udhaaharan bhi die hai
 'shrut', 'pratibha' and 'adyay' are considered by Dandi to be the three regulatory qualities of mere poet
