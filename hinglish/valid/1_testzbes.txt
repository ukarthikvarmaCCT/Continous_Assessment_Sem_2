 parmaar vansheey raajaaon ne malwa kii rajdhani dharanagari se aathvin shatabdi se lekar chaudaavin shatabdi ke purvardh tak rajya kiya tha
 Bhoja made many wars and established his reputation, which proves that he had extraordinary merit
 yadhyapi unke jivan kaa adhikansh yudhakshetra main beetaa tathaapi unhone apane rajya kii unnati main kisi prakaar kii baadha na utpann hone di
 He built many temples in the cities and villages of Malwa, though very few of them are known now
 kaha jaataa he ki vartmaan madhyapradesh kii rajdhani bhopal ko raja bhoj ne hi basaaya tha, tab uskaa naam bhopal nagar tha, jo ki kaalaantar main bhoopal or phir bhopal ho gaya
 Raja Bhoj had built a sea-like pond near Bhojpal Nagar, which went to the huge Shiva temple of Bhojpur in the east and south
 aaj bhi bhojpur jate samay, raste main shivmandir ke paas us talab kii pattharon kii bani vishaal paal dikhti he
 At that time the water of that pond was considered very holy and curing diseases
 kaha jaataa he ki raja bhoj ko charm rog ho gaya tha tab kisi rishi yaa vaidya ne unhen is talab ke pani main snaan karne or use pine kii salaah di thi jisase unka charmrog thik ho gaya tha
 The huge Shivling installed in the Shiv temple was also anointed with the water of that huge pond
 raja bhoj swayan bahut bade vidwaan the or kaha jaataa he ki unhone dharm, khagol vidya, kala, koshrachana, bhavannirmaan, kavy, aushadhashastra aadi vibhinn vishyon par pustaken likhi hai jo ab bhi vidyaman hai
 In his time, poets got shelter from the state
 unhone san 1000 i
 se 1055 i
 tak rajya kiya
 Due to his scholarship, a proverb became popular in the public where Raja Bhoj and Gangu Teli
 bhoj bahut bade vir, pratapi, or gungrahi the
 He conquered many countries and produced many texts of many subjects
 ye bahut achche kavi, darshanik or jyotishi the
 Many texts like Saraswati Kantabharan, Shringaramanjari, Champuramayan, Charuchara, Tattvaprakash, Behavansamuchya etc
 are written in this
 inaki sabha sadaa bade bade panditon se sushobhit rahati thi
 His wife's name was Lilavati, who was a great student
 jab bhoj jivit the to kaha jaataa tha- is; Saraswati is always alive; All pundits are respected
 ) When he died, it was said - raja bhoj munj ke chote bhai sindhuraj ke putr the
 Rohak was his prime minister and Bhuvanpal minister
 kulchandra, sarh tathaa taraditya inke senapati the jinaki sahaayta se bhoj ne rajyasanchalan sucharu rup se kiya
 Like his uncle Munj, he also wanted to establish an empire in western India and to fulfill this desire, he had to fight with his neighboring states in every direction
 munj kii mrityu shokajanak paristhiti main ho jane se parmaar bahut hi uttejit the or isiliye parmaar bhoj chalukyon se badla len ke vichaar se dakshin kii ore sena lekar chadhaai karne ko prerit hue
 He attacked the treaty with Kalburi Gangaideva of Dahl and Rajendra Chola of Tanjore as well as the south, but the then king Chalukya Jaisingh II bravely confronted and saved his kingdom
 san 1044 i
 ke kuch samay baad jaisingh ke putr someshwar dwitiya ne parmaron se phir shatruta kar lee or malwa rajya par akraman kar bhoj ko bhaagane ke liye baadhya kar diy
 After taking possession of Dharanagari, he set fire, but a few days later Someshwar left Malav and Bhoja regained power after plunging into the capital
 san 1018 i
 ke kuch hi pehle bhoj ne indrarath naamak ek vyakti ko, jo sambhavat: kaling ke gang raajaaon kaa samant tha, haraaya tha After ending the war with Jai Singh II and Indrath, Bhoja moved his army towards the countries bordering the western border of India and first attacked the kingdom called Lat, which extended south to Surat under the Bombay state
 vahaan ke raja chalukya kirtiraj ne aatmasamarpan kar diya or bhoj ne kuch samay tak usapar adhikaar rakhaa
 After this, in about 1020 AD, Bhoja attacked Konkan, located south of Lat and extending from Thana district to Malagar beach and defeated the king of Shilharas named Arikeshri
 konkan ko parmaron ke rajya main mila liya gaya or unke saamanton ke rup main shilaharon ne yahan kuch samay tak rajya kiya
 In 1008 AD, when Mahmud Ghaznabi invaded a kingdom called Punjabi Shahi, Bhoja sent his army along with other states of India to oppose the invader and help Shahi Anandpal, but no result of this reconciliation of Hindu kings
 He did not come out and was defeated on this occasion
 san 1043 i
 main bhoj ne apane bhritibhogi sipaahiyon ko punjab ke musalamaanon ke viruddh ladane ke liye dilli ke raja ke paas bheja
 At that time Punjab was a part of Ghazni empire and only the descendants of Mahmud were ruling there
 dilli ke raja ko bharat ke anya bhaagon kii sahaayta mili or usne punjab kii ore kooch karke musalamaanon ko haraaya or kuch dinon tak us desh ke kuch bhaag par adhikaar rakhaa parantu ant main gazani ke raja ne use haraakar khoyaa hua bhaag pun: apane samrajya main mila liya
 Bhoja also once marched against Kalachuri Gangaideva of Dahl, who had supported him at the time of the invasion of the south
 gangeyadev haar gaya parantu use aatmasamarpan nahin karnaa padaa
 Shortly before 1055 AD, Ganga's son Karna entered into a treaty with Chaulukya Bhima i of Gujarat and attacked the Malavas from the east and the west
 bhoj apana rajya bachaane kaa prabandh kar hi rahaa tha ki beemaari se uski aakasmik mrityu ho gai or rajya sugamawa se akramanakariyon ke adhikaar main chalaa gaya
 In the north Bhoja also invaded the country of the Chandelas where a king named Vidyadhar ruled
 parantu usase koi laabh na hua
 The Bhoja's attempt to conquer Gwalior did not have any good result because the king of Kachhapaghat Kirtiraj faced his attack firmly
 aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki bhoj ne kuch samay ke liye kannauj par bhi vijay paa lee thi jo us samay pratihaaron ke patan ke badwaale parivartan kaal main tha
 Bhoja also declared war against the Shakhambari's Chahmanas in Rajasthan and defeated the then King Chahaman Seenram
 iske baad usne chaahmaanon ke hi kul ke anhil dwaara shaalit nadul naamak rajya ko jeetne kii dhamkee di, parantu yuddh main parmaar haar gaye or unke pradhan senapati sarh ko jivan se haath dhonaa padaa
 Bhoja also fought for a long time with the Chaulukyas of Gujarat, who built their capital at Anhilapattan
 chalukya solanki naresh mulraj pratham ke putr chanmudraj ko varanasi jate samay malwa main parmaar bhoj ke haanthon apamaanit hona padaa tha
 His son and successor Ballabhraj got very angry on this and thought to avenge this insult
 usne bhoj ke viruddh ek badi sena taiyaar kii or bhoj par akraman kar diya, parantu durbhagyavash raste main hi chechak se uski mrityu ho gai
 After this, Vallabhraj's younger brother Rare Raj took the reins of power in his hands
 kuch samay baad bhaaj ne use bhi yuddh main haraaya
 During the reign of Bhima's successor Bhima, Bhoja sent his commander Kulchandra to wage war against Gujarat
 kulchandra ne puure pradesh par vijay praapt kii tathaa uski rajdhani anhilapattan ko lutaa
 Bhima once invaded Abu and defeated his king Parmar Dhandu when he had to flee and seek refuge in Bhit in Chitrakoot
 jaisaa upar bataaya ja chukaa he, san 1055 i
 ke thode hi pehle bhim ne kalchuri karn se sandhi karke malwa par akraman kar diya tha parantu bhoj ke rahete ve us pradesh par adhikaar na paa sake
 Raja Bhoj was very brave and majestic, as well as Prakand Pandit and virtuous
 inhone kai vishyon ke anek granthon kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 He was a very good poet, philosopher and astrologer
 saraswatikanthabharan, shringarmanjari, champuramayana, charucharya, tatvaprakash, vyavaharasamucchy aadi anek granth inke likhe hue batalaaye jate hai
 His meeting was always decorated with great priests
 inaki patni kaa naam leelavati tha jo bahut badi vidhushi thi
 Raja Bhoj has composed works in all fields of knowledge
 unhone koi 84 granthon kii rachana kii he
 Chief among them are- dow mahesh singh ne unki rachanaaon ko vibhinn vishyon ke antargat vargeekrut kiya he- Bhagwati Charan Vohra) was the great revolutionary of India's freedom struggle
 ve hindustan prajatantric socialist party ke sadsy or bhagat singh ke saath hi ek pramukh siddhantkaar hote hue bhi giraftaar nahin kiye ja sake or na hi ve faansee par chadhe
 He died in an accident during a bomb test
 bhagwati charan vohara kaa janm july 1903 main agra main hua tha
 His father Shiv Charan Vohra was a high official of the railway
 baad main ve agra se lahore chale aaye
 His family was financially prosperous
 bhagwati charan kii shiksha-diksha lahore main hui
 They were also married at an early age
 patni kaa naam durga tha
 Later, his wife also became an active partner in revolutionary work
 krantikario dwaara diya gaya " durga bhabhi " sanbodhan ek aam sanbodhan ban gaya
 During education at Lahore National College, Bhagwati Charan formed a study group of students, taking inspiration from the Russian Revolutionary
 raashtra kii paratantraa or usase mukti ke prashn par kendrit is adhyayan mandali main niyamit rup se shaamil hone waalo main bhagat singh, sukhdev aadi pramukh the
 Later these people established the Naujawan Bharat Sabha
 padhai ke dauraan 1921 main hi bhagwati charan gandhi ji ke aahvaan par padhai chhodkar asahyog aandolan main kud pade the
 Later, when the movement returned, he completed his college studies
 bie ki pariksha paas kii saath hi noujvaan bharat sabha ke gathan or kaary ko aage badhaaya
 General secretary of this assembly was Bhagat Singh and Propaganda secretary Bhagwati Charan
 april 1928 main noujvaan bharat sabha kaa ghoshnaa patr prakashit hua
 Advice from Bhagat Singh and other companions - Bhagwati Charan Vohra's work was to prepare the Masavide in consultation
 noujvaan bharat sabha ke utkarsh main bhagwati charan or bhagat singh kaa hi pramukh haath tha
 Apart from Bhagat Singh, he was the principal theorist of the organization
 krantikari vichaarak, sanghathankarta, vaktaa, prachaarkarta, adarsh ke prati nishtha va pratibadhata tathaa uske liye aparaajey himmat - hausala aadi saare gun bhagwati charan main vidyaman the
 Bhagwati Charan was unmatched in completing a task with full enthusiasm
 1924 main suprasiddh krantikari shachindranath sanyaal dwaara "hindustan- prajatantric sangh ke ghoshnaa patr - di revolutionari" ko 1 janvari 1925 ko vyapak se vitarit karne kii pramukh jimmedaari bhagwati charan par hi thi
 Which he completed well
 baad ke daur main sanghathan ke saathiyo main bhagwati charan ke bare main yah andeh failaayaa gaya kii ve si0 ai 0 di0 ke aadmi he or usase tankhwaah pate hai
 Those people who came in the organization at the time behind the imposition of these allegations were not to risk any work
 isliye bhi ve log bahuaiami vyaktitv ke dhani bhagwati charan par aarope lagaakar na keval khud netritva main aana chaahate the
 Rather, they wanted to ban revolutionary actions
 aise logo kaa yah uddeshy bhi tha ki sanghathan ke kaam ko aapasi bahes, mubaahisa, prachaar or paisa jamaa karne ke kaam tak simit kar diya jaae
 The main gentleman among those who accused CID on Bhagwati Charan was Jayachandra Vidyalankar
 ve un dinon neshnal kalege ke adhyaaapak bhi the
 His position, knowledge and scholarship was also on the young revolutionary group
 bhagwati charan aise aaropon se beparwaah rahete hue krantikari kaaryo ko aage badhaane main lage rahete the
 He said that "it is their job to do what is right
" safai dena or naam kamanaa unka kaam nahi he
 " bhagwati charan lakhanu ke kakori cese, lahore shadyantr cese or phir lala lajpat raay ko maarane vaale angrej sargent - sanders kii hatya main bhi aropit the
 But neither was ever caught nor did he step back from doing revolutionary works
 is baat kaa saboot yah he ki itane aaropon se ghire hone ke baad bhi bhagwati charan ne special train main baithe vysarai ko chalati train main hi uda dene kaa bharpoor prayaas kiya
 Yashpal, Indrapala, Bhagaram were his allies in this work
 maheene bhar kii taiyaari ke baad niyat tithi par guzarati special train ke neeche bam - bisphot karne main log kaamyaab bhi ho gayi
 But the Viceroy survived

As a result, the farmers were no longer the owners of the land, they were now renters dependent on the mercy of the landowner! 3 The methods of recovery were inhuman! 4 Zamindari buying and selling mortgages had become the object of partition! 5 Zamindars had come to the city from the village to work in their place which were completely greedy and exploited the peasants to the maximum! 6 The income of the farmer used to go towards repaying the land revenue and the debt started falling on his head, poverty increased in the villages, agricultural production also fell because there was no motivating reason for the farmer that the produce would have been of the landlord so that he could Did not even do farming! 2 Raiyatwadi system was the second settlement implemented by the British Raj, it was implemented in 1820 in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Deccan! Within this, the farmers were directly contacted, these farmers were the owners of their land, but in this settlement, the rate of land revenue was very high, 48-52%, when it was 55%, the recovery was very ruthless! Farmers who could not pay taxes were put in jail, which they also had to bear themselves, as a result of this, due to high land revenue, the price of land in these areas was greatly reduced! 2 Most of the production used to go to pay taxes! 3 Farmers used to take loans from moneylender so that they could pay the tax, which once came in this trap, they could not get out, so here too, the landowners became landlords! 4 Both the collector and the moneylender were exploited together! 5 The biggest increase in rural debt was in these areas! 3 Mahalwadi system - The last settlement implemented by the British government which was implemented in 1822 was the symptom of this! 1 The governance of the entire village was determined! The pioneer family of 2 villages were made Mahaldars, they used to determine the tax of every farmer and collect the tax collected by the government and the tax was fixed on a personal level even though it was a matter of fact! The result 1 Mahaldar had become an intermediary class who were also leaders and were getting the most out of it! 3 Rural society began to disintegrate! The results of the geopolitical system were all arranged in the spirit of maximum exploitation, but the government did not want to have any concern with agriculture and farmers! 2 This led to the formation of the middle class, all these were exploiting the farmers, but there was no way to protect them! Be the reason for it! 4 Due to very high rates, the farmers had nothing to live for, they went on getting poorer, they were burdened with debt! 5 The state of agriculture deteriorated, the farmers were depressed on its side, the middle class was uninterested, the government was mean to recover! Curzon went to establish the agriculture department in 1899 after a continuous famine! In fact, the British The government had no agricultural policy adhik se adhik bhumi ko vyapaarik fasalo jute, kapaas, ganna, opium, nil, chaay, kaafii ke adheen laana tha, in fasalon kii kheti jameendaar, british bagan maalik, sahuukaar, tathaa madhyast varg kisaanon se jabaran karwaata tha in fasalon kii keemat kisaan ko bazaar bhav se naa de kar ve apni marji kaa prayog karte the in fasalon kii kheti naa karne par kisaanon ko kathor yaatnaao kaa saamana karnaa hota tha !sabase karaab haalat nil ke kisaanon kii thi unke dwaara 1859-1860 kaa prasiddh nil vidroh bhi kiya gaya tha

 Dutt, 'british rule made India a country of recurrent famines, famines that had never been in the history of India or the world' 1 Due to the famines, famine was considered a natural disaster
 There were no human able to deal with them! 2 In fact, the reasons were different
 Curzon himself believed that 'famines were not the wrath of God because many famines had come without drying up' even though the famines were poor a number of social economic reasons were responsible for Ta and Recurring such as available food stock, transport facilities, increase in prices, lack of work programs for food, very poor purchasing capacity of the public! 3 RC Dutt had high geopolitics Was considered to be the cause of famine! 4 The famine of famine was that the grain was cheap, and it was also exported, but millions of people did not have the money to buy it
 No reduction, but died due to lack of purchasing power! 5 Black marketing, hoarding, and complete lack of public distribution system also increased the magnitude of famine! 6 Administrative reasons were also responsible; The government had no means to know the population distribution, cultivated area, quantity of food grains, the condition of fertilizers in different areas, food behavior of people, general economic system of the people! 7 Famine Commissions also gave erroneous reports
 The Lyell Commission said, "famine is the only unemployment-related problem of the peasantry!" 8 Britishers: Due to the land revenue settlement, agricultural production was continuously falling, especially after the land which produced food grains first
 i started producing crops like jute, jute, which could not be found and their price was not even met! Amari was it was also the Jnkshti and increased! 2 Due to these, the population could not get bus again for many years and normal activities could not be done
 3 Due to heavy manpower, wealth, lack of animal-seeds, it used to take many years for the salvation of agriculture, during which there were constant deaths due to incest, thus these relationships were wound! 4 Animals had high mortality rate of human beings, due to famine, low life expectancy, excessive labor force also had consequences due to famine! Had an insulting PL 480 plan 1 bharat ke sadiyo puraane hast udhog ko nasht kiya gaya jo rojgaar kaa bada saadhan tha or hamaari saanskrithik viraasat kaa bhaag tha !2 bharat ko odhogik kranti ke falo se praytanpurn dhang se vanchit rakhaa gaya tha tathaa yah aadhunik udhog lagane naa dena ye prakriya pratham vishwa yuddh tak chalati rahi !dengul tharner jinhone is saklpana kaa aalochnatam vishleshan kiya he ke parinamo kaa varnan karte hua kaha he 1 british sarkaar ne sab kuch sochi samajhi chaal se kiya taaki britain main odhogik kranti safal ho sake is hetu hi bharat ko mukt vyapaar kaa sabase bada kshetra banaaya gaya is prakriya ne bharat se dhan nikasi ko tej kar diya !2 bharat kii paaramparik aatmanirbharta samaapt ho gai! 3 kaaryshil shram bal khaskar udhigo me kam ho gaya! 4 nirmaan udyong main bhi rojgaar kii kami aa gai !5 bhartiya hast tathaa kutir udyong nasht ho gaye nagar ujaad gaye pashchim me odhogik kranti hone pe karigar nae kaamo me lag gaye kintu bharat me unako kisaan bananaa padaa kyonki yaha nae udhog viksit hue hi nahin the !6 bharat kaa bazaar british maal se bhar gaya tha wo sirf kachche maal kaa niryaat karata tha! 7 vishwayuddh kaal me bharat ko dikkat kaa saamana karnaa padaa kyonki videsh se maal kii aporati band ho gai thi ! The meaning of drain of money - Before the establishment of the British Raj, India was the world's largest industrial producer, its main exports were spices, indigo, sugar, silk cloth, medicine, precious stones, handicrafts, and cotton textiles
 The balance was more in favor of India, the countries were full of gold and silver deposits

 Dutt and others also worked in this field! His main concept was the poverty of India, soon after Dada Bhai's citation, 'poverty and Un British Rule in India', was published in which he said that he received from India
 1 / 4 of the revenue goes out of the country to Britain and then it only increases the resources of the British! 'it is the constant flow of money that is sucking the life blood of India' Naoroji considered this exploitation as the root of all evil and the main cause of India's poverty, after which Ranade also published his views about it! Best work r

 Dutt had done his book, the economic history of India had created panic! All these creations worked to tell the people of India about their poverty
 These ideas came to know that the reason for the country's poverty is that much of the country's gross domestic product goes to Britain, instead of which the country gets no benefit
 Mill is the principle of withdrawal of wealth! It was not associated with any limited concept, it did not mean only the export of money and goods! According to Dutt, the tax and expenditure incurred by the people remains between them and only develops them but when the money gets out of the country
 If it does not benefit the country from that then, according to Dutt, the withdrawal of funds has created a shortage of capital in India, which has stopped the development of the country, according to them, money from the revenue also has been released
 The Asi Jisse farmer gets poor! Dutt severely criticized that British rule in India is like a continuous loot and attack which is Timur, Nadirshah, It is worse than the attack of Abdali and any charmer
 They have come and looted, but the British Raj is being looted every day, due to which India has become a country of famines and famines which are often more horrific and any comparison of them or India Cannot be done in world history! Along with economic awakening, Sidhant had also done political awakening
 It has told the people of India the true intention of British Raj and told them that Rakrati and what the consequences can be !, This gave rise to the demand for self-government, its appeal also affected the middle class to the intellectual class! Sources of money withdrawal - RC Dutt analyzing the nature of money withdrawal Talked about the ways in which the money is passed from the country
 Direct sources - The money sent to England, salary, gratuity, which was given to civil, civil workers in Britain
 The establishment of the ST India Company and later the expenses of the Office of the Secretary of India! 3 Dividend to the shareholders of the company which was 10
5% of the revenue of India! 4 The biggest direct route was home charge, purchase of military equipment for India, expenditure on India office, military expenditure, especially spread of colonialism from India's fund
 Such as India Afghan War, Boer War, World War! Indirect Exit 1 The biggest route was trade, from India money was sent to Britain to purchase goods here! In this way India did not get anything in return for its goods
 With the commercialization of agriculture, the extraction of raw materials started

 Dinkar's language has always seen an obviousness and simplicity, but in Urvashi the simplicity of the language is wearing a spark of embellishment and arrogance - perhaps it is demanding the object for this work

 Vande Mataram was second in the top 10 songs in the poll
 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 Initially, only two of its verses were composed, which were in Sanskrit
 in donon padon main keval mathrubhumi kii vandana thi
 When he wrote a Bengali novel called Anand Math in 1882, then he also included this song in the love of the motherland
 yah upanyaas angreji shashan, jameendaaron ke shoshan va prakritik prakope main mar rahi janata ko jaagrit karnehetu achaanak uth khadey hue sanyasi vidroh par aadhaarit tha
 This factual history was mentioned by Bankim Babu himself in the third edition of 'anand Math'
 or maje kii baat yah he ki saare tathy bhi unhone angreji vidwaanon-gleg va hanter kii pustakon se diye the
 In the novel, this song is sung by a monk rebel named Bhawanand

 "the verse after Mukhade is also in Sanskrit:" Shubhra Jyotsnaam Pulkit Yaminim, Ful Kusumit Drumdal Shobhinim; Suhasiniin Sumadhur Bhasheenam, Sukhaand Varadaan Mataram
 " kintu upanyaas main is geet ke aage jo pad likhe gayi the ve upanyaas kii mul bhashaa arthath bangla main hi the
 In all these latter terms, the motherland is praised as Durga
 yah geet ravivaar, karthik sudi navami, shake 1797 ko puraa hua
 It is said that he wrote this song on the train while coming to Naihati from Sealdah
 bengal main chale swadhinata-aandolan ke dauraan vibhinn reliyon main josh bharne ke liye yah geet gaaya jane laga
 Gradually this song became highly popular among the people
 british sarkaar isaki lokapriyata se bhayakrant ho uthi or usne is par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur sang this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1896
 paanch saal baad yani san 1901 main kalakatta main hue ek anya adhiveshan main shri charandas ne yah geet punah gaaya
 The song was given by Sarladevi Chaudharani at the Banaras session of 1905
 congress-adhiveshnon ke alaava aazaadee ke aandolan ke dauraan is geet ke prayog ke kaaphi udhaaharan maujuud hai
 Lala Lajpat Rai started the publication of the journal from Lahore named Vande Mataram
 angrejon kii goli kaa shikaar banakar dam todanevaali aazaadee kii divaani maatangini haajra kii jubaan par aakhri shabd "vande maataram" hi the
 In 1907, when Madame Bhikhaji Cama hoisted the tricolor in Stuttgart, Germany, "vande Mataram" was written in the middle of it
 arya printing press, lahore tathaa bhartiya press, dehradun se san 1929 main prakashit kakori ke shahid pan0 ram prasad 'bismil' kii pratibandhit pustak "kranti gitanjali" main pehla geet "matra-vandana" vande maataram hi tha jisamen unhone keval is geet ke do hi pad diye the or uske baad is geet kii prashasti main vande maataram sheershak se ek swarchit urdu ghazal di thi jo us kalkhand ke asankhya anaam hutatmaon kii aawaaj ko abhivyakti detii he
 Restricted in the British period, this book is now edited and available in libraries
 swadhinata sangram main is geet kii nirnaayak bhagidaari ke baavjood jab raashtragan ke chayan kii baat aayi to vande maataram ke sthaan par rabindranath thakur dwaara likhe va gaaye gayi geet jan gana man ko variyata di gayi
 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved
 swatantrata prapti ke baad dow rajendra prasad ne samvidhan sabha main 24 janvari 1950 main 'vande maataram' ko raashtragit ke rup main apnaane sambandhi vaktavy padhaa jise sweekaar kar liya gaya
 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
 kya kisi ko koi geet gane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin? yah prashn sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh bijoy emmanuele varses kerala rajya naam ke ek vaad main uthaaya gaya
 In this suit, some students were expelled from school because they refused to sing the national anthem Jana Gana Mana
 yah vidhyaarthee skool main raashtragan ke samay iske sammaan main khadey hote the tathaa iskaa sammaan karte the par geet ko gaate nahin the
 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

 pradaah sharir main raktavahikaaon kaa hanikaarak kaarnon, jaise pathojan, kshatigrast koshika yaa uttejkon aadi ke kaaran sharir kii pratikriya hoti he
 Inflammation is an attempt by animals to remove dangerous or harmful stimuli and initiate the process of cell or tissue regeneration
 sujan sankraman kaa paryaay nahin he
 Inflammation is a form of local reaction produced by any stimulant in the body
 kisi bhi sthaan par sujan, lalaai, taap evam pidaa tathaa akaryaksham pradaah ke mukhya lakshan hai
 All these symptoms are caused by a reaction in the inflammation
 pradaah kaa ekmaatr uddeshy uttejk vastu se sharir ko mukti dilaanaa tathaa usase hui kshati ko purna karnaa hoti he
 Inflammation can occur in any part of the body
 phode funsi, ghaav, nymonia, sujan kaa hona, zukam, aankh dukhana, kaan bahna, kshay rog aadi sab pradaah ke hi vibhinn rup hai
 Stimulating objects, living and non-living things, can be divided into two parts
 sajiv, jaise rog ke sookshm jeevanu, paraseete aadi hai tathaa nirjeev, bhautik kaaran jaise garmi, sardi, vidyut, agyaat rashmiyaan, vijaateey padaarth, chot laganaa aadi tathaa rasinic padaarth, jaise kshar, amla, kaa anekon vish aadi, pradaah ke bhinn bhinn kaarak hai
 There are two main forms of inflammatory and long-lasting
 uttejk vastu kii maatra, sharir ke upar uttejk vastu kaa prabhaav or sharir kii pratirodh shakti ke upar pradaah nirbhar karata he
 Both living and non-living substances can produce both acute and long-term inflammation
 pradaah main teen prakaar kii pratikriyaayein hoti hai : Parganas or adenocarcinoma and excretion reactions predominate in acute inflammation, and adipocyte and amniocentesis in long-term inflammation
 in sabhi pratikriyaaon main rudhir evam lasika, tathaa sanyojak or indriya utak ke vividh avyav bhaag lete hai
 The microbes of the disease enter the body and start the reaction of inflammation in the connective and sensory tissues, on the mucosa or through the blood and lymph tubes
 yadi rogaanu adhik maatra main hue, yaa unki vifailli shakti adhik hui, athwa sharir kii pratirodh shakti kam hui, to pradaah ugr rup le letaa he
 These reactions take place in the following way: First, the arteries of blood shrink for short periods of time
 isse rudhir kaa bahaav un dhamnikaaon ke andar teevr ho jaataa he, tatpashchaat ye dhamnikaaye chaudee ho jaati hai or rudhir kaa pravaah unke andar mand ho jaataa he
 This increases the proliferation of microtubules and lymphatic ducts, causing the skin or mucosa above the inflammation to become red and hot
 in sookshm keshikaon kii bhitti kii koshikaaye apni sankhya main prachurodbhavan dwaara vruddhi kar amoeba kii bhanti kaa aakaar dhaaran kar leti hai, jisase koshikaon kii bhitti khurdari ho jaati he
 In the bone marrow, multicellular white cells come out of their follicular motion at the place of inflammation
 inke saath saath rakt ke laal kan bhi pradaah sthaan par nikal aate hai
 Thus, as a guard of the body, multicolored white cells come in the first line and encounter the enemy
 ye shwet koshikaaye sharir ke paryaavaran main kisi vishesh padaarth ke sankethik prativachan dwaara uttejit sthaan par ekatrit hoti hai
 This action is called chemical simulation
 rakt kaa taral padaarth us pradaah sthaan par, visheshtya sookshm koshikaon kii bhitti par, rogaanuon ke vish dwaara utpann uttejit shakti par nirbhar karte he
 Toxins of microbes form threadlike proteins, which multiply multicolored white cells from one place to another to form various blood particles, fluids, and adipose tissue
 utakon main is sujan ke dabaav se tantrika par tanaav, padane lagata he, jisase pidaa hone lagati he
 Among the various types of cells that participate in inflammation, multicellular and monolithic leukocytes of the blood and monolithic cells of the tissue participate in bactericidal activity by swallowing microbes, weakening their power
 ugr pradaah ke prarambh main bahukhandee shwet koshikaaye hi pradhan rup se jeevanubhakshan kriya sampann karti hai
 Sinogenic germs attract more of these cells towards them, so multicellular cells attract more in these types of inflammation, so only multicellular cells are found in this type of inflammation
 rakt kaa thos tathaa taral padaarth or utak ke vividh avyav rogaanuon dwaara utpann vish kii maatra ko halakaa karke sharir ko uske aghat se bachaate hai
 Both actions - first, bacteriophage and second, the coming out of the plasma by the blood vessels - protect the body from its shock by lightening the amount of toxin produced by microbes
 donon hi kriyaayein3⁄4 pratham, jeevanubhakshan tathaa dwitiya, plasma kaa raktanalikaaon dwaara baahar aana 3⁄4 sharir ko rogaanuon se utpann kshati se mukti dilaane kii ore agrasar karti hai
 All these diverse activities are carried out by the encouragement of chemical substances and nerves
 yadi rogaanuon kii sankhya tathaa uttejk shakti adhik na hui or sharir kii pratirodh shakti prachur maatra main hui, to bahukhandee shwet koshikaaye in jeevanuon par vijay kii ghoshnaa kar unako jeevanubhakshan kriya dwaara nigalkar tahas nahas kar detii hai
 In this activity, some multicellular cells also collapse
 in dharashaayi koshikaon se ek prakaar kii protein vilaayak vastu utpann hoti he, jo mrit utakon aadi ko ghulaakar pradaah ke taral padaarth tathaa dharashaayi shwet koshikaon or rogaanuon ko lasika kii nalikaaon dwaara pradaah sthaan se dur le jaati he
 If the germs are victorious by their venom, the multicellular cells in the inflammatory site are dashed in large amounts and take the form of pus
 pradaah laal rang se parivartit hokar pilaa rang dhaaran kar letaa hai
 This is called cooked boil
 jab phode kaa upachaar aushadhiyon dwaara karte hai, tab rogaanu nasht ho jate hai or us sthaan par pradaah ke ant main rakt kii tathaa utakon kii akhandee koshikaaye ekatrit hokar, teevr gati se jeevanu-bhakshan-kriya dwaara rogaanuon ko nigalkar nasht kar detii hai
 At the same time, these monolithic cells also swallow the dashed multicellular cells that have been killed by microbes, and thus the effort to restore the place of inflammation to a healthy state remains active
 utak koshikaaye apni sankhya me prachurodbhavan dwaara vruddhi kar, sthaan par sanyojak utak kii sahaayta se naveen rachana karti hai or vah sthaan phir se swasth ho jaataa he
 If germs attack the body moderately and in small amounts repeatedly, or the body's resistance is somewhat less, then the body responds to the attack of these microbes in another way
 in rogaanuon se utpann uttejk shakti kaa prabhaav sharir par shanai: shanai: padakar deergh sthaayee pradaah kaa rup le letaa he
 The secretion activity is very small in this flow, so multicellular cells also do not take special part in it
 inke sthaan par lasikanu, plasma koshikaaye or utakon kii akhandee koshikaaye prachurodbhavan kriya dwaara sankhya main vruddhi kar pradaah sthaan par ekatrit hoti hai
 Along with these, new microscopic vessels and cells are formed at that place and that place takes the form of chronic granulation tissue
 isi ko ghaav kehete hai
 The site of damage caused by inflammation of the wound is made healthy by increasing connective tissue proliferation

 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language

 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european

 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh

 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought
 ye vichaardhaara aajkal duniya ke adhiktam bhashavid or itihaaskaar maanate hai
 The "kurgan tomb-mounds" of Central Asia are believed to have been created by the ancient Aryans
 ek duusari vichaardhaara ke anusaar pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bharat hi he or yaheen se arya kabeeley europe or baaki asia main pravaas kiye
 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued
 adhiktar bhashavidon ke anusaar "aadim-hind-europea" bhashaa ke punarnirmit shabd yahi ishaara karte hai ki pracheen arya janmasthan ek vishaal, shitoshna ghaas kaa charaagaah tha
 By the way, there are no similar words found in Greek, Latin, German and other indo-european languages for the words of Indian climate and animals, such as peacock, cock, tiger, elephant, mango, banana, peepal, banyan, neem, hot Mausam, ganda, buffalo, rice, etc

 yah sho ahmedabad main sthapit he, or sujana ghai dwaara nirmit he
 The story of the show is a different girl, Sushil, the 51st child of the Parekh family
 susheel kii maa ko chhodkar ek sadak durghatana paarekh parivaar ke sabhi mahila sadasyon ko maar detii he
 Avni gives birth to Susheel but dies
 durghatana kii yojana lila, kiran kii maa ne kii thi, vah apni beti kiran ko khaarij karne ke liye mehal, susheel ke pita se badla lenaa chaahati thim
 She did not want Mehul's baby girl
 bachche ko dada ji, mehul or do chachaa main chaar pita milte hai, jo unhen apni duniya banaate hai
 Mehul finds Sushil auspicious
 paarekh parivaar ek nae jivan main jane kaa faisla karata he
 They moved to Surat
 ve lila se bachane kii koshish karte hai
 The four men start raising Sushil with love and care
 lila mehul kii talash main he
 He still wants to complete his revenge
 sho main kuch saal kii chalaang lagati he
 Sushil is seen as a cute and mischievous girl who loves her family very much
 dada ji use bahut pyaar karata he
 He constantly asks her to do some feminism
 susheel apane parivaar main purushon kii tarah shant rahane kaa anand letaa he
 She behaves like him since his birth while learning his behavior
 lila surat jane kaa faisla karti he
 He does not know that the Parekh family is living in Surat
 anya, satya lila ke pote hai
 Sushil and Satya meet in the temple
 unki mulaakaat apriy ho jaati he
 Sushil followed the truth
 vah chot lagi he
 Leela, another reason for revenge on the Parekh family, does not want to leave the girl who has hurt her grandson
 suhel ko pakadaney ke liye lila kadi mehnat karti he
 He does not know that Mehul's child Sushil is still alive
 paarekh parivaar ahmedabad main sthanantarit karne kaa faisla karata he
 Susheel is now grown up
 vah sundar dikhti he lekin vyavhaar tomby
 Truth is introduced
 vah ek pul par chalata he or ek nadi main kudata he, jabaki uskaa dost use dahi handi pratiyogita ke bare main bataata he
 Satya is winning the competition all these years
 vah atisamvedansheel ho jaataa he or der se pravesh letaa he
 Sushil rushes to make it to the top at any time
 susheel pehle dahi handi tak pahunchataa he or ise todane main safal hota he
 Satya gets a girl to break her records
 vah pareshaan ho jaataa he
 Sushil dances and celebrates his victory
 susheel ne trophy jiti, ek murti jise bahut shubh mana jaataa he
 Satya decides to steal the trophy from Sushil
 chori trophy ke baad, satya apni daadi se khush he
 Leela hated Sushil and hated his friendship with Satya
 is bich, satya phir se susheel ko is samaaroh main le jaati he jo lila ko or adhik ugr banaata he
 Satya tells Leela that he is impressing Sushil for the condition and will break her heart soon
 lila ko yah sunakar khushi ho rahi he kyonki use susheel pasand nahin he kyonki susheel ne satya ko chot pahunchaai he
 She is waiting for Sushil's pride to subside
 satya apane pyaar naatak ke saath jari he or susheel ke saath khel kheltaa he, jabaki vah vastav main susheel se pyaar karata he
 Apart from this, Sushil also starts developing feelings for him
 aakhirkaar, satya bhi apane dil ko badalata he or susheel se maafi maangane kaa faisla karata he or use icecream kii taarikh par le jaataa he
 Satya tries hard to tell him his plan
 satya apane dimag ko badalata he or sachai bataane kaa faisla karata he
 Sathya tells him that he had a condition with his friends and wanted to make her suffer from heartbreak
 haalanki, susheel ke saamne satya kii sachai nahin aati he
 Also, he confesses everything to Sushil but Sushil does not pay attention to her and runs to save a girl, who is hit by a truck
 jab vah chot pahunchi to susheel apni bahaduree se ladki ko bachaati he
 Satya becomes worried for Sushil and runs after him
 satya ko uske bare main garv mahasoos hota he
 Sushil is still unaware of the condition of truth
 baad main, satya phir se susheel ko sab kuch bataane ke liye saahas kho detaa he
 On the other hand, Leela's conspiracy to punish Suhail also fails as Satya arrives there and saves Sushil
 jabaki, susheel satya par andeh karte hai or mahasoos karte hai ki vah vahi he jo uske liye pareshaani paidaa kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, Satya is also falling in love with Sushil but there is no information about it
 lila ne satya ko susheel ke kareeb aane se nafrat kii or unke bich duuri banane ke liye har sambhav prayaas kiya lekin isse unhen bahut kareeb aa gaya
 Mehul takes all his courage to talk about Sushil and Satya's alliance
 iske alaava, mehul bataate hai ki susheel or satya achche dost hai or ve ek duusare kii tarah hai
 Leela finds out that they have failed in an attempt to kill Sushil and gets another chance for revenge
 iske alaava, kaali sikhti he ki susheel apni bachapan main saheji gai ladki thi or lila vah vyakti thi jisane susheel ko maarane kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Mehul and others are worried about Leela's decision on coming home and Leela accepts Sushil and Sathya's offer
 lila bhi rasik kii dendaree kaa bhugtan karti he jo bakhe or mehul dwaara lambit thi
 On the other hand, Leela tells Satya about Kiran's mental state and she says that Sushil's father Mehul is responsible for it
 satya ko yah jaanane ke liye shok kiya gaya he, jabaki lila ne unhen mehal ke parivaar se badla lene ke liye susheel se shaadi karne ke liye kaha tha
 Satya gets very emotional learning Kiran's story
 is prakaar satya ne susheel or let se shaadi karne kii lila kii yojana ko sweekaar kiya use chhod do
 Leela arranges for Satya and Sushil's engagement
 ve sangeet ke saath bhi shuru karte hai or har koi dhunon ke liye nrity kaa anand letaa he
 Leela makes some plans against Sushil
 susheel khushi se lila dwaara di gai sabhi chunautiyon ko puraa karata he
 Also, Mehul sheds tears upon seeing his daughter in pain
 jabaki, lila ko susheel kii kamajori pataa tha ki vah kutton se darati he or is prakaar vah susheel kii uphaar plate main kute kii haddi rakhti he
 Sushil gets scared and throws him, while Satya bursts at Sushil as well as his father
 susheel bura mahasoos karata he or vah satya se apane pita ke sambandh main baat karne ke liye kahati he
 Later, Sejal and others pacified the situation
 lila ab ek chaaku ke saath susheel daraane kii koshish karata he
 Susheel gets worried and she screams again
 har koi susheel ko shant karne kii koshish karegaa lekin vah kahenge ki koi jaanboojhkar aisa kar rahaa he kyonki vah pehle haddi or ab chaaku se dar gai thi
 Thus Sushil's family is surprised to find Sushil happy
 lila apni yojanaon main susheel ko fansaane ke liye taiyaar he or shaadi ke liye bahut utsahit he
 Leela dances happily and gives a warm welcome to Sushil and his family
 susheel khush nahin he kyonki mehul abhi tak is jagah tak nahin pahunche hai
 Sushil keeps on believing that Mehul will come
 duusari taraf, lila shaadi main susheel pagal sabit karne kii aakhri yojana banaati he
 Sushil has also got a video recording that Jhano accidentally sends Sushil
 susheel sikhta he ki yah uski bhayavahata nahin thi or kuch vastav main maafee he
 In addition, Lila gives Sushil a bunch of gifts full of jewels and plans to electrocute Sushil through a necklace
 is bich, vishu ne apane camere ko satya ke kamare main chhod diya he or puri vaartalap or video lila or jhaano ke record main aa gai he
 Kali finds the camera in Satya's room
 kaali camere main lila kii yojana paati he or vah ise dekhne ke liye chaunk gai he
 Kali understands that Leela was harassing Sushil and thus Sushil behaved strangely at the wedding rituals
 kaali ne susheel kii pichhali durghatnaon ko bhi yaad kiya jab lila ne use maarane kii koshish kii
 Later, Kali confronts Leela and she tells him that she will not let her plans succeed
 kaali bataati he ki lila kii vajah se susheel apni maa ke bina rahi he
 On the other hand, Leela is worried that Kali has learned the truth
 lila ne usase kaha ki uske paas uske khilaaf koi saboot nahin he to vah kya karegi
 Kali shows a video recording of him talking about his plans with Zhano
 lila yah dekhne ke liye chaunk gaya he
 Kali decides to reveal the truth to Leela
 iske alaava, satya is vivaah naatak se tang aa gaya he or vah yah bataane kaa faisla karata he ki vah susheel se shaadi nahin karnaa chahta
 On the other hand, Leela ultimately saves Sushil and is too concerned with his game plans to be revealed by Kali
 is prakaar lila ne susheel kii dekhbhaal kii or use satya se shaadi karne ke liye ghar waapas le liya
 Also, Sushil is still worried for Mehul and she keeps looking for him
 or antat bakhe ne lila ke parivaar ke saath apane ateet ke bare main susheel ko puri sachai bataai
 Sushil will be shocked to learn about his father
 iske alaava, vah yah bhi bataata he ki satya ne use ghar par rahane or apni shaadi main shaamil hone ke liye kaha he
 Thus Sushil decides to face Sathya while she hears him saying that he does not love Sushil
 baad main, susheel ko yah jaanane ke liye chaunk gaya or ansu bahaayega
 Thus Sushil will decide to stop this marriage
 susheel keval apane parivaar ke liye satya se shaadi karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaati he, jabaki puri sachai seekhney ke baad vah mandap main satya se shaadi karne se inkaar kar detii he
 Leela and Sathya's plans slip as Sushil refuses to marry her
 ahankaar sangharsh ke baavjood satya or susheel kii shaadi ho gai he
 Satya tells that he will ruin his life and he will destroy the bed
 susheel ne use barbaad karne ke liye kaha or vah khud ko barbaad kar degaa
 Kali brings the camera and Leela asks to find her
 kaali ko saboot milanaa shuru ho gaya, jabaki vah nahin mil sakaa
 The flashback is shown when Kali was in the kitchen and Zano takes the camera and removes the video footage
 mehul ne satya ke bare main sachai sikhi
 Mehul is shocked to hear this, and has a heart attack
 uske baad susheel ne lila kii sachai ke bare main siikhaa
 On the other hand, Leela decides to take this opportunity and makes Sushil suffer more
 susheel ne lila ko satya ko behatar vyakti banane ke liye chunauti di he
 Also, Leela and Sushil get into a fight for Chip
 donon chip dhundne ke liye gear karte hai or gubaare fatne lagate hai jabaki aakhri susheel ko chip milti he
 Satya helps Sushil burst the balloon and the two share an eye lock moment together
 susheel or satya din main kareeb aa rahe hai lekin lila ke bure prabhaav ne unhen susheel se dur rakhaa he
 On the other hand, Sushil decides to end the game and exposes Leela to everyone
 susheel ne satya ko lila kii vaastaviktaa or uske liye galat impressant seekhney kii yojana banaai he
 Sathya and Sushil's bond will gradually become stronger and stronger that Leela will not bear
 satya ne susheel se apane jivan se nikalne ko kaha
 Later, Sushil feels bad and she decides to leave
 susheel pack karata he or auto main aata he
 Meanwhile, Satya stands up and removes his frustration and says that he had to do so Mehul Parekh Leela married him to Sushil
 satya sweekaar karata he ki vah susheel se pyaar karata he
 He says that he loves her very much
 susheel ko yah sunakar abhibhoot ho gaya or vah waapas rahane or satya ko behatar vyakti banane kaa faisla karti he
 At the Holi festival, Sathya and Sushil were getting ready for a tug of war challenge between girls and boys
 satya phir se match jeetne ke liye dhokhaa de rahaa tha or vah use khone ke liye susheel ke saath chhedchhad kar rahaa tha
 Satya kisses her flying while Sushil gets lost seeing Satya and she was leaving the rope
 susheel satya kii bahon main gir rahaa tha or match haar gaya tha
 Satya's team dances on their victory
 susheel ne apane ateet ko bhi yaad kiya jab satya ne trophy jeetne ke liye dhokhaa diya
 Satya plays Holi with Sushil and applies color to her
 lila aashcharyachakit he ki satya or susheel uske saamne holi khel rahe hai
 Sushil also throws color on Satya and runs away
 susheel khush he or usne sabhi ko yah kehete hue bulaayaa ki satya ne holi khelaa
 Everyone applies color to Satya when Leela is angry
 susheel ne apane kaam ke bare main satya se sawaal uthaaya
 She asks him to join the business
 baad main, susheel satya kii sivi jabaki satya ne unhen bataaya ki vah swayan hi bana sakate hai
 Sushil eventually convinces her and he starts making his CV
 susheel satya kii madad karata he or ve donon ek acha bandhan viksit karnaa shuru karte hai
 Leela was focused on Sushil and she was ruining her life and wanted to throw him out of Sathya's life
 duusari ore, satya susheel se pyaar karti he or vah ise krodh main vyakt karata he
 Leela plans to destroy Sushil's marriage life by bringing another girl into Satya's life
 lila ne satya ke liye dulhan kii khoj karne kii yojana banaai or usne apni tasviren vaivaahik site ke liye lee
 Leela was helped by Sushil for this

 Sushil has also agreed to prepare a profile for Shivam
 iske alaava, satya ne susheel kii madad se apana sivi bhi banaaya
 On the other hand, Leela is planned to break up Satya and Sushil's relationship and create Satya's profile on the matrimonial site
 ant main satya ne naukari saakshaatkaar par jane kaa faisla kiya, jisase susheel bahut khush ho gaya
 Satya hides her feelings towards Sushil
 iske alaava, lila apni yojanaon se shuru hoti he or vah apane ghar kii taiyaari ke saath shuru hoti he
 Everyone is left confused with the decoration
 lila ne sabhi ko bataaya ki ve sivam ke liye dulhan dhund rahe hai
 Satya's profile is seen by a lot of girls
 iske alaava, lila ne ghar par ladakiyon kaa swaagat karne kii vyavastha bhi kii

 Whereas, she falls into Satya's arms

 Soumya gets confused when Sule changes the subject and takes her to his room
 lila satya kii jindagi main ek or ladki laane ke liye khush hai
 Saumya was getting closer to the truth
 susheel or satya lila kii yojana ke bare main anjaan hai
 Saumya is accepted by everyone to be the wife of Shivam
 jabaki unamem se koi bhi lila ke badsoorat iraade se anjaan he
 Leela reveals the truth to Soumya and asks her to be Sushil's co-wife
 saumy ne apane iraade ko bure iraade ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 Soumya also accepted Shivam's proposal
 susheel or uskaa parivaar sivam or saumy kii sagaai ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 Whereas, Soumya has some other plans in mind
 saumy samaaroh ke liye taiyaar hone main unki madad mangakar satya ko seduces
 Satya loses control of her emotions and becomes close with Soumya

 Meanwhile, Sushil is looking for Soumya as everyone is waiting for her

 Poetry-drama is the gift of introduction
 Prof
 Chandra has given the definition of poetry-drama as follows- ‘‘vah na to har taraf se band naatak he or na hi naatakeey kavita yah ek aisa naatak hota he jo vishay-vastu or swaroop vidhaan donon main hi purnroop se kaavyatmak evam naatakeey hota he
 In other words, there is an acting drama in the poem, which is a poem, full of beauty and thoughtfulness
 sachcha kavy-naatak keval chandovddhata se hi bharaa-pura nahin hota, balki isamen padya naatakkaar kii vastu vyanjana ke liye anivaary evam aprihaary ang banakar aata he
 It is clear from the above definition that poetic drama is a confluence of poetic and metaphorical
 isamen kavy-jivan ke raag-tatva badi spashtataa se ubharkar aate hai
 The drama element creates its Brahmin form
 naatak-tatva kathanak kaa nirmaan karata he ghatnaayen detaa he, sangharsh detaa he, paatro kii sristi karata he or kavy tatva imasen anubhutiyon kaa daan detaa he
 According to the above analysis, the elements of poetry-drama are as follows- 1

 Structuralist criticism is the critique of analyzing literature based on the values of structuralist linguistics
 roman jacobasan or claude levi strous aadi sanrachnawadi aalochana paddati ke pramukh aalochakon main shaamil hai
 This criticism method is part of a larger movement
 isamen sahitya ke paath ke arth ko samajhane ke bajaay usase pathak ke arth grahan karne kii prakriya ko samajhane kii cheshtaa kii jaati he
 Roland Bartsch, Gérard Gentet and Julia Kristeva, etc
 established this criticism as an important critique method
 sanrachnawad is soch se asahmat he ki sahitya, lekhak or pathak ke bich sanchaar kii ek vidhi he
 In this view a literary "work" becomes a "text"
 lekhan kii vidhi saahitiyik paramparaon ke 'code' main ek naatak ki tarah gathit hai
 For these reasons confusion of reality arises but there is no truth value in them
 iske bajaay yah mana jaataa he ki maanav ke sachet 'swayan' kaa nirmaan bhashaa pranali se hi hua he
 The rules of language convention have always existed in the human brain and these rules are found in a lesson
 in par lekhak kaa koi niyantran nahin hota
 Roland Barthes declared in this context that - "the writer is dead
" sanrachnawadi aalochana lekhak ke bajaay pathak ko mukhya sanchaalak pramanit karti he, is kaaran ek uddeshypurna, bhavuk pathak ko avyekthik pathan kaa kaary saunpa jaataa he
 Thus the text read by the reader has no clear meaning but is a method of writing called 'ecriture'
 sanrachnawadi aalochana paddati kii shuruyaat saanskrithik manovigyaanik claude levi strous ne kii
 Strauss used the method of structuralism to understand mythological stories and family relations and other cultural events

 According to this logic, all social and cultural processes are a set of signs

 Structuralist critics try to understand the relation of these social processes and symbols, and to clarify their rules
