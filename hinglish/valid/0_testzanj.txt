 Many possibilities, fantasies and beliefs have been introduced from time to time regarding the origin of American Indians

 In relation to this, there was also the belief that they are the offspring of the original inhabitants of the fictional island called "atlantis continent" or "moo" of the Pacific Ocean mentioned in legends
 madhya america kii maaya indian jati or pracheen misr kii sthapatyakala main samta drushtigat hone ke kaaran yah anumaan bhi kiya gaya ki indian misr athwa misr se prabhavit deshon se america aae
 In this context, it is necessary to know that the ancient architecture of Egypt had declined several thousand years before the time when the Mayan Indians started construction of temples
 america main pracheen maanav sambandhi vaigyanik khojein hone ke pehle yah sambhavta bhi thi ki indianon ke purvaj is bhoomi par maanav jati kii ek swatantra shakha ke rup main viksit hue hon, parantu ab yah nishchit rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki amareeki mahadwipon par maanav jati kii koi shakha ke vikascram main is bhubhag par keval limar, tarasier or katipay jatiyon ke bandaron ke prastikrut avshesh hi mili hai
 Even after diligently searching the scholars of ancient mankind, near human apes or ancient human beings could not find any remains here
 is tarah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki yahan maanav jati kii kisi shakha ke swatantra vikaas kii sambhaavna nahin thi or yahan ke pracheenatam nivaasiyon ke purvaj sansar ke kisi anya bhaag se aakar hi yahan based honge
 Experts believe that humans came to this part from Asia via the Bering Strait
 shaareerik visheshtaon kii drushti se indian asandigdh rup se asia kii mongolaide prajati kii ek shakha maane ja sakate hai
 The ancestors of Indians who came to America via the route from the Ashes to Alaska had certainly developed to the level of modern humans or "homo sapiens"
 ve apane saath apni mul asian samskruti ke anek tatv bhi avashya laae honge
 He was probably familiar with the use of fire and had also learned to manufacture and use the weapons and equipment of the medieval culture

 It can also be said that they must have developed some primary form of language by that time

 For several hundred years, these groups had to come by snow-covered landmarks; But it is possible that later groups may travel partly in boats as well

 In time, the intermingling of these groups became the dominant feature of Mongoloid species among Indians
 ye aadi indian apane apane saath nav-prastar-yug ke pehle kii samskritiyon ke kuch tatv is bhoomi par laae
 While trying to reconstruct their original culture, Kroeber has made a list of the culture elements who probably came to America along with the Adi Indians
 dabaav dwaara yaa ghiskar banaae hue pathar ke aujaar, paalish, kiye hue haddi or sing ke upkaran, aag kaa upyog, jaal or tokare banane kii kala, dhanush or bhaalaa phenkane ke yantra or paaltu kute sambhavat: indianon kii mul samskruti ke mukhya tatv maane ja sakate hai
 Upon coming to America from Asia, the ancestors of Indians either completely separated from their native Asian branch or maintained some kind of relationship with it, there is a difference of opinion among scholars on this subject
 is prakaar ke sambandhon ko banaae rakhane main jo bhautik kathinaaiyaan thim unke aadhaar par sahaj hi yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki yadi in bhubhaagon main sambandh tha bhi to vah apane vistaar or prabhaav main atyant simit rahaa hoga
 Later, the directions of cultural development that these groups adopted were not influenced by the Brahmo cultures
 nav-prastar-yug kii samskruti kaa vikaas in samoohon ne swatantra rup se kiya
 They domesticated new creatures such as alpacas, lamas and turkeys
 saath hi, makka, cocao, menio yaa kasaava, tambaakoo or kai prakaar kii semon aadi vanaspatiyon kii kheti unhone pehle pahal aarambh kii
 It is a matter of surprise that the neo-stone-era Mayan Indians invented many such cultures that were invented in the relatively developed cultures of the copper-bronze Age in Europe and other parts of the world

 Their social organization is simple

 He decided not to print anything about Amitabh in his publications

 In 1988, Bachchan returned to films after a short political span of three years and played the title role in Shahenshah, which was successful at the box office due to Bachchan's return

 Amitabh should ignore these lousy allegations and focus on his acting

 jaisaa tulsidas ne ramcharita maanas ke balkand main swayan likhaa he ki unhone ramcharita maanas kii rachana kaa armbh ayodhya main vikram samvath 1631 ko ramanavami ke din kiya tha

 Although both the Ramayana and the Ramcharitmanas describe the character of Rama, there is a significant difference in the description style of the poets who composed the epics

 Tulsidas has divided Ramcharitmanas into seven scandal

 As the above-mentioned quadrant shows, these people have come many times to say that whatever groom you want to ask, ask for it; But Manu Satarupa had to ask for Parambrahma himself as a son, then how could he ask for a boon from Shankar, Brahma and Vishnu? Our Lord Shri Ram is omniscient

 " is akaash vaani ko jab manu satarupa sunate hai to unka hryday prafullit ho uthta he
 And when Parambrahma Rama himself appears, praising him, Manu and Satarupa say- “sunu sevak surtaru suradhenu, Bidhi hari har bandit pada renu

" arthath jinke charnon kii vandana vidhi, hari or har yani brahma, vishnu or mahesh teenon hi karte he, tathaa jinke swaroop kii prashansa sagun or nirgun donon karte hai: unase ve kya var maangen? is baat kaa ullekh karke tulsi baba ne un logon ko bhi ram kii hi aradhana karne kii salaah di he jo keval niraakaar ko hi parambrahm maanate hai

 isi prakaar aatma main varna kaa sadbhaav or asadbhaav donon aagamasammat hai, parantu inke anusaar vyaavhaarik rup main to varna aatma main hai, parmaarthik rup main nahin hai
 He considered the unity of body and soul in practice, but in the determination, he considered the difference between the two
 ve dravya ko satta se abhinn maanate he
 In Vaisesika philosophy, power considers matter to be true due to the general, but they say that in this opinion, matter will become dissatisfied due to separation from power
 at: dravya satta rup hi he or yahi paramtatv he
 Power develops in the form of matter, quality and substance in the country, so everything is a matter of matter

 By considering this distinction, spiritualist philosophers honor an individualism
 jain darshan bhootvaadi he, aadhyatmavaadi nahin
 Nevertheless, he considered a distinction between behavior and determination
 jo saamanyat: dikhaai detaa he vah sarvada satya nahin hota or koi aavashyak nahin ki satya sadaa shuddh rup main gochar ho
 He considered three forms of the soul
 bahya padaarthon main aasakt, deh ko apane se abhinn samajhane vaali moodhaatma bahiraatma he
 When the body becomes aware, it is said that the soul that is moksamarga is the conscience
 dhyanabal se karmmal kaa kshay ho jane par jab aatma shuddh rup praapt kar leti he
 Then it is called God
 isi paramatma ko unhone shiv, brahma, vishnu, buddha aadi kahkar tatkaaleen darshan se apane ko parmarthat: abhinn ghoshit kiya he jo sambhavat: kisi jain acharya ne nahin kiya
 It is his specialty that distinguishes him from the other Jainacharyas and is a reflection of his syncretic tendency
 unhone aatma ko kaary-karan se bhinn maanakar sankhya ke kutasth purush kii kalpana ke saath samanvit kiya parantu aatma ko akarta nahin mana
 In his opinion, the soul is not the agent of non-committal culmination, but it is also considered to be the doer due to its consequential
 aatma gyaan aadi swagat parinaamon kaa to karta he hi
 He said that the element cannot be described with behavior and determination
 tatv pakshaatikrant he
 The creature is in pure form, not impaired

 Practices are resolved with determination

 Some reposados can be outdated in new wooden barrels, so as to get the taste and smoothness of the wood, but in a short time
 anejo ko praayah reposado ko rakhane ke liye istemaal kiye gaye bairal main hi rakhaa jaataa he

 However, Mexican traditional shot is straight tequila and when the chaser is used, the preferred fruit is lemon
 yah mana jaataa he ki namak takila kii "jalan" ko kam karata he or khattey fal swaad ko santulit or badha dete hai
 In Germany and some other countries tequila auro is often consumed first with cinnamon and later with orange flakes, while tequila blanco is consumed with salt and lemon
 antat, duusare lokapriy sharaab jaise hi, anek prakaar ke shot sambandhit drinking games or "stant" drinks hote hai, jaise ki body shot

 tab devi ne vijay kaa aashirwad diya evam swapn main raja ko samudr ke tat se shila rup main unki murti nikaal kar sthapit karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The king, after his victory in 1604, got the rock out of the ocean and got the goddess embossed in Amber and got it installed here

 a monolithic idol of Ganesh's coral is also installed above the entrance of the temple
