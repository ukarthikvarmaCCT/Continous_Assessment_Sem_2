 Quark is an elementary particle and is the basic component of matter
 quark ekajute hokar sammishra kan hedron banaate he, parmaanu nabhik ke mukhya avyav proton va neutron inamen se sarvaadhik sthir hai
 Due to natural phenomena color binding, quark Na was never directly observed or found in solitude; They can only be found within hedrons, such as baryons and mesons
 quark ke anek aantarik gun he, jiname vidyut aavesh, dravyaman, rang aavesh or spin sammilit he
 In the standard model of particle physics, quark is the only elementary particle that senses all four fundamental interactions or fundamental forces, plus it is the only known particle whose electric charge is not an integer product of the primary charge
 quark ke chah prakaar he, jo jane jate he flavor se: ap, down, strinj, charm, top or bottm
 The mass of the up and down quarks is the lowest of all quarks
 apekshaakrit baari quark kanika kshay kii prakriya ke madhyam se tivrata se ap va down quark main badal jate hai
 Corpuscle decay is a change from a higher fluid state to a lower fluid state
 is vajah se, ap va down quark aam taur par sthir hote he or brahmad main sabase aam hai, vahiin strinj, charm, bottm or top quark keval ucch urja takkaron main utpann kiye ja sakate he
 Each quark is an antidote to the flavor, whose magnitudes are equal to the quark, but the signs are opposite and are known as antiquarks
 quark model swatantra rup se bhautikavidon mare gail-man or jorge wig dwaara 1964 main prastaavit kiya gaya tha
 Quarks were introduced as part of the hadrons
 1968 main stenford raikhik twarak centre par prayog hone tak unke bhautik astitv ke bahut kam pramaan the
 Accelerator experiments provided evidence for all six flavors
 top quark sabase ant main fermilab par 1995 main khoja gaya
 Quark is one of the basic particles from which matter is formed
 proton va neutron inhi moolbhoot kano se bane hote he
 Quarks are known by their flavor and are of six types: Up Quark, Charm Quark, Top Quark, Down Quark, Strange Quark and Bottom Quark
 inke pratik chinh kramash: u, c, t, d, s or b he
 The first three types of quarks are called up-type quarks and the remaining down-type quarks
 ap or down quark kaa dravyaman sabhi quarko main sabase kam hota he
 Heavy mass quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks due to mass decay, as up and down quarks are generally permanent and most commonly found in the universe
 quark kaa pratikan {anti partical} anti-quark kehalaata he, prayek prakaar ke quark ke pratikan hote he, jo kramash: anti-ap quark xxrep 4 - anti-batom quark kehalaate he
 Quarks are not found alone, but are always found in groups
 quark se milakar banane vaale avyav hedron {hadrons} kehalaate he
 Baryons {baryons} are formed from a combination of three quarks, anti-beryons by combining three anti-quarks, and mesons by combining one quark and one anti-quark
 do ap quark evam ek down quark ke sangyojan se proton tathaa ek ap quark evam do down quark ke sangyojan se neutron banate he
 Baryan, mesan, proton, neutron, nucleon {a proton + a neutron} and an atomic nucleus are all called hadrons because they all consist of quarks
 quark kaa sankhyikeey vyavhaar fermion hota he
 Quarks have a variety of properties, such as electric charge, color charge, geometry or spin {spin} and mass
 pratikan main bhi yah sabhi gun paye jate he, parantu vipareet hote he
 The electric charge of the up-type quark is +2 / 3 and that of the down-type quark is -1 / 3
 inke pratikan kaa aavesh vipareet kramash: -2 / 3 or +1 / 3 hota he
 The electric charge of particles formed by combining quarks is equal to the sum of the total electric charges of quarks found in it
 jaise:- proton kaa vidyut aavesh, do ap-quark or ek down-quark ke vidyut aavesho ke kul yoga ke baraabar arthath 1 hota he
 Similarly, the electric charge of a neutron is zero
 mukhya lekh : durbal antahkriya One of the four fundamental interactions of particle physics, only through weak interactions can a quark of one flavor be transformed into a quark of another flavor
 ek w boson ko avashoshit yaa utsarjit karke kisi bhi ap-prakaar quark ko kisi bhi down-prakaar quark main parivartit kar sakate hai tathaa isi tarah thik iske vipareet
 This flavor change mechanism causes a radioactive process of beta decay, in which a neutron is "split" into a proton, an electron, and an electron antinutrino
 yah tab hota he jab kisi neutron main koi ek down quark kaa abhaasi W− boson utsarjak dwaara ap quark main kshay ho jaataa he or neutron ko ek proton main badal detaa he
 The W− boson then breaks into one electron and one electron antinutrino
 kwantum chromodynamiks ke anusaar, quark janmajaat rang aavesh naamak gundharm rakhte he
 There are three types of color charge - green, red, and blue
 isi tarah teen prati rang aavesh hote he-megenta, syaan or pilaa
 Each quark carries one color, while each antiquark carries one color
 rang aavesh keval quark or gluon main hote he
 Keep in mind, color charge has no relation to the color spectrum of visible light
 teen rangon ke bhinn-bhinn sanyojanon ke saath quarkon ke aaveshon ke madhya aakarshan or pratikarshan kii pranali prabal antahkriya kehalaati he, jisaki madhyasthata gluon naamak bal vaahak kan dwaara hoti he; isaki neeche main vistaar se charchaa hui he
 The theory that explains strong interactions is called quantum chromodynamics
 a quark, which will have a single color value, can form a bound system with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor
 The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ξ plus an antiquark with color charge −ξ will result in a color charge of 0 and the formation of a meson
 This is analogous to the additive color model in basic optics
 Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same "white" color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon
 The quark has a fault or spin of 1 / 2

 Vadodara city, the administrative headquarters of Vadodara district, is located on the banks of the Vishwamitra River in the south-east of Ahmedabad, east-central Gujarat state, western India
 vadodara ko baroda bhi kehete hai
 The earliest mention of it is in the Adhikadan or Gazette of 812 AD, in which it is described as Vadapadrak

 The Maurya dynasty was a powerful and great dynasty of ancient India, the Kamboja dynasty
 isane 137 varsh bharat main rajya kiya
 Its establishment is credited to Chandragupta Maurya and his minister Kautilya, who defeated Emperor Ghanananda of the Nanda dynasty, who was the brother of Chandragupta Maurya

 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture
 
 Chandragupta was the son of the same Gana chief who was killed as a warrior in his childhood
 chandragupta main raja banane ke swaabhaavik gun the 'isi yogyata ko dekhte hue chanakya ne use apana shishy bana liya, evam ek sabal raashtra kii niv daali jo kii aaj tak ek adarsh he
 This was followed by a web of spies spread across India to collect secret information against the king as traitors - this was perhaps unprecedented in India
 ek baar aisa ho jane ke baad usne chandragupta ko unani kshatrapon ko maar bhagane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives
 magadh ke akraman main chanakya ne magadh main grihayuddh ko uksaaya
 His detectives bribed Nanda's officers and made him in his favor
 iske baad nand shaasha ne apana pad chhod diya or chanakya ko vijayshri praapt hui
 Nanda had to lead an exile life after which what happened to him is unknown
 chandragupta maury ne janata kaa vishwaas bhi jeeta or iske saath usko satta kaa adhikaar bhi mila
 At that time, Magadha was the most powerful state in India
 magadh par kabja hone ke baad chandragupta satta ke kendra par kaabiz ho chukaa tha
 Chandragupta started his conquest of western and southern India

 The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman states that a dam on the Sudarshan Lake was built by Pushyagupta for irrigation
 pushyagupt us samay ashok kaa prantiy rajyapal tha
 After liberating northwest India from Greek rule, its focus shifted to the south
 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter
 celukas ne megasthaneez ko chandragupta ke darbar main rajdoot ke rup main bheja tha
 According to Plutarch, "sandrocottus had ascended the throne by that time, he had trampled and subjugated the whole of India with his army of 6,00,000 soldiers"

 The poet Nana is unique not only in the use of verses, but also in bringing rhetoric between the middle and the end of the steps
 ’’ In 'geetgovind' poetry, Jayadev has adopted an all new and original style by not following the traditional composition system
 shloke, gadhy or geet ke mili-jule prayog dwaara kavy main anupam rachana-maadhurya kii sristi hui he
 The poet has used shlokas in descriptive contexts such as the visual planning or stage-specific depiction required for sustaining the narrative
 paatro kii manodasha ko suchit karne vaale sanvadatmak prasangon main gadhy kaa prayog hua he tathaa bhavanubhuti kii abhivyanjana padyon main kii gayi he
 Thus, in the innovative composition system adopted in 'geetgovind', the characters, dialogues and songs are interwoven in such a way that they feel a unique joy
 is anupam rachana-style ke aavishkarta jayadev, apane upmaan aap hi hai
 radha-krishna's racy portrayal of the Keli stories and his convergent pastimes make Geetagovind a captivating book of spiritual adornment
 radha-krishna ke pranay ke chithran main prem kii vividh dashaon—aashaa, niraashaa, utkantha, irshyaa, coup, maan, aakrosh, milanotsukata, sandesh-preshan tathaa milan aadi—kaa jaisaa abhibhoot karne vaala hridaygrahi chithran is kavy main hua he, vaisaa anyatra dhundhane par bhi kahin nahin miltaa
 Radha does not like or tolerate raas-vilas with Sri Krishna's gopis
 radha apni sakhi ke madhyam se shrikrishna ke prati apana aakroshamulak upalambh bhejti he, parantu us anany pranyini ko itane se santosh nahin hota, uskaa prem nirbhar-hriday use apane priyatam ke prati apane pragadh anuraag ko vyaktigat rup se prakat karne ko vivash kar detaa he
 On the arrival of Radha, Shri Krishna leaves Braj and the beauties and is oriented towards him
 radha kii sakhi shrikrishna se radha kii or radha se shrikrishna kii ek-duusare main gahan anurakti kaa tathaa ek-duusare se dur rahane par anubhav kii ja rahi virahajanya vednaa kaa maarmik varnan karti he
 She inspires the two to meet each other with her soft and gentle words
 chandroday hone par pranay-vyathaa se adheer bani radha apane uddipt anuraag par niyantran nahin rakh paati or uski abhivyakti ko vivash ho jaati he
 Radha expresses her anger and resentment towards him with utterances filled with utterances upon Shri Krishna's arrival
 idhar radha kii sakhi radha se maan ko chhodane kaa anurodh karti he udhar swayan shrikrishna radha ke rup-soundarya kii prashansa ke vyaaj se uski chatukaarita karte hue use manaane evam apane anukool banane kii cheshtaa karte hai
 Eventually Radha's values go away and she goes to kadamba-kunj to meet her Kant
 vahaan shrikrishna radha se pranay-yachana karte hue usase lajja-sankoch ko chhodane kaa anurodh tathaa rati-bhoga main sahyog dene kaa manuhaar karte hai
 Both of them indulge in a rishi play with a happy mind, and after this Radha asks Pranayasikthan utterances to make her adornment to her beloved Shri Krishna
 apni pranpriya ke anurodh ko gaurav dete hue shrikrishna saharsha apane haathon se radha kaa shringaar karte hai
 Some critics today accuse Jayadeva of making devotion to radha-krishna as an adornment, but this blasphemy on the poet worshiping the melody is not only unjust but his own indiscretion
 vastutah daampaty pranay main uplabdh tanmayata athwa talleenta ke charam utkarsh kii tathaa bhed main abhed kii kalpana ke chudant nidarshan kii abhivyakti hi bhakthi ke kshetra main maadhurya bhav kii sristi karti he
 For the devotees who worship with a sweet sentiment, the beautiful gestures, luxuries and love stories of God are lyrical and noteworthy
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki vidwaanon ne is saare kavy ko 'aprastut prashansa' maanakar vaacharth main chhipe vyangyarth ko vyakt karne kaa prayaas sweekaar kiya he
 According to his opinion, Shri Krishna is the symbol of 'soul of creatures'
 gopiyon kii krida anek prakaar kaa vah prapanch he, jisamen agyaan-avasthaa main fansi manushyon kii aatma bhatakati rahati he
 Radha is the symbol of Brahmanand, only on achieving that, the individual gets extreme happiness
 katipay vidwaanon ke anusaar jayadev radha kaa upaask na hokar shrikrishna ke hi upaask the
 Therefore, Krishna is not a symbol of the soul of humans but a symbol of God
 is tathy ko vaani dete hue acharya baldev upaadhyaay likhte hai—‘‘shringaar-shiromani shrikrishna bhagwat-tatva ke pratinidhi hai or unki premi gopikaayen jeev kii pratik hai
 The union of radha-krishna is the union of jiva-brahma
 is prakaar sadhana maarg ke anek tathyon ke rahasy ko yahaan suljhaayaa gaya he
 '' ‘gitgovind’ vastutah ek anupam evam adbhut granth he, jiske uddaam-shringaar ke antstal main rahasyamayi maadhurya bhaavana kii nigudh dhara bah rahi he
 In the entire Sanskrit literature, no other composition of this category is sweet
 sanskrit bharti ke soundarya or maadhurya kii paraakaashtha kaa avlokan karnaa ho, to ‘gitgovind’ kaa anushilan karnaa chahie
 Its vignette depicts beauty as it is
 iske geeton ke pad-laalitya alokik maadhurya kaa sanchaar karata he
 The beauty of its verses provides unbeatable joy
 shabd or arth kaa saamanjasy aisa manomuguakari he ki sanskrit se aparichit vyakti bhi usase prabhavit hue bina nahin rah saktaa
 Its Komalakant phrase is rare in the poetry of any language of the world
 is kavy main prayukt deergh samaason main bhi vilakshan prasadikta evam swar-maadhurya he
 The poet is unique in the use of alliteration
 unke geeton main anupras kaa prayog padon ke ant main hi nahin, madhya main bhi apni chata bikherta hua chalata he
 Such a gem-glass combination of fine verses and the Komalakant phrase has been made that the mere expression of the songs leads to the emergence and communication of the corresponding rasa in the hearts of the millennials
 shringaar kii vyanjana ke liye yah anuthi style badi hi sarthak siddh hui he
 'geetgovind' gained immense fame and popularity
 jayadev ne jis gram main rahete hue ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana kii, us gaanv kaa naam hi jayadevapur pad gaya
 King Pratap Rudradeva of Orissa, a contemporary of the poet, issued an order for singers, musicians and dancers of his kingdom to sing the verses of 'geetgovind'
 maharaj ne jayadev ko is kavy rachana ke liye ‘kavirajraj’ kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit kiya
 'geetgovind' had become sufficiently popular and popular during Jayadeva's lifetime - many evidences are found
 dakshin main to vah itnaa adhik prachlit ho gaya ki iske padyon ko tirupati balaji ke mandir kii sidhiyon par dravin lipi main khudhvaya gaya
 In the Shrivallabh sect, it has the same reputation as the Srimad Bhagavat Purana
 vaishnavon main yah vishwaas he ki ‘gitgovind’ jahaan gaaya jaataa he, vahaan bhagwaan kaa avashya hi pradurbhaav hota he
 Due to this, a law has been made not to sing it in an inappropriate place in this community, which is strictly followed
 vaishnav sampradaay main jayadev kavi ko is sampradaay kii madhyavastha kaa mukhya mahanubhav mana gaya he
 According to the following verse prevalent in the community, the Vishnu Swami, who was promoted by Vishnu Swami and promoted by Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya, gave protection to the community by the devotee poet Jayadeva in the midst of these two great personalities
 is prakaar vaishnav sampradaay main jayadev bhi guru ke rup main vandaneey hai— Jayadeva invented a new formulation system in Sanskrit by creating 'geetgovind'
 ‘gitgovind’ ke anukaran par sanskrit main ‘abhinav gitgovind’, ‘gitaraghav’, ‘gitgangadhar’ tathaa ‘krishnagit’ jaise anek geet kaavyon kii rachana hui, parantu koi bhi kavi apane kavy main ‘gitgovind’ jaisi utkrushtataa laane main safal nahin hua
 Here in India, Bharatendu Harishchandra tried to translate it in Brajbhasha, but the translation of 'true poetry' cannot be done - this statement has proved to be literally true in relation to 'geetgovind'
 anuwaad main mul rachana ke ras-bhav kii avatarana asambhav nahin, to kathin avashya he
 The German poet Goethe's comment on the translation of the 'geetgovind' poem in the Anglo-language by Sir William Jones is very accurate
 ‘A Real Poetry is that, which cannot be translated
’’ arthath utkrisht kavita kii pahchaan kaa aadhaar hi yahi he ki uskaa duusari bhashaa main anuwaad nahin ho saktaa
 Thirty-five scholarly efforts are available to understand the song of 'gitagovind' and to communicate its beauty to the gentlemen, but this poem is such a deep ocean that anyone who dips deep into it
 uske haath main utane hi durlabh evam bahumoolya ratna aa jate hai
 Poetry composed by some poets on the emulation of this poetry is a sign of Jaydev's acceptance of kirti-kaumudi's lightness and excellence
 bhakthi, shringaar or kavitv kii trivenirup ‘gitgovind’ kavy kaa krishna-bhakthi sahitya main ek anya drushti se bhi ullekhneey mahatva he
 It is a well-known fact that before this poetry, the names of Rukmini and Satyabhama were used as the beloved or wife of Shri Krishna
 radha naam kii kisi stri kaa koi astitv nahin tha
 In the Srimad Bhagavat Purana, there is a mention of one Gopi worshiping 'anayaradhito Nunam' Sri Krishna, but there is no mention of Shri Krishna's beloved wife, Radha, who attained importance at the same time as Krishna who joined with Krishna
 
 radha ko is ucch sthaan—shrikrishna kii anany sahachari evam unase abhinn tathaa unki nityashaktirupa—par pratishthit karne ke shrey ‘gitgovindakaar’ jayadev ko hi praapt he
 On the basis of the continual vilas of radha-krishna depicted in this book, the Brahma Vyavarta Purana describes the beauty and actions of radha-krishna, but it is a harsh truth that the Puranakas neither describe 'geetagovind' poetry
 No one has been able to sustain dignity and decency, nor has the description been made as simple, interesting and heart-warming
 is kshetra main bhi jayadev apane upmaan aap hi hai
 It is on this basis that perhaps 'geetagovind' poetry in krishna-bhakti literature has the distinction of scripture
 khubaani ek guthlidaar fal he
 From the botanical perspective, apricot, potato bukhara and peach are all fruits of the same botanical family named "prunus"
 uttar bharat or pakistan main yah bahut hi mahatvapurn fal samajha jaataa he or kuch visheshgyon ke anusaar yah bharat main pichley 5,000 saal se ugaaya ja rahaa he
 There are many types of vitamins and fiber in the khubani
 angreji main khubaani ko "apricott" kehete hai
 In Pashto it is called "khubani"
 farsi main isko "zard aalu" kehete hai
 In Persian, "aloo" means "aloo Bukhara" and "zarda" means "yellow", that is, "gold Potato" means "yellow Potato Bukhara"
 dhyaan rahe ke jise hindi main aalu bolte hai use farsi main "aalu jamini" bolte hai 
 "jardalu" is a word similar to Persian in Marathi
 khubaani ke ped kaa kad chota hota he - lagbhag 8-12 meter tak
 Its stem thickness is about 40 cm
 upar se ped kii tahaniyaan or pattey ghaney faile hue hote he
 The leaf is 5-9 cm long, 4-8 cm wide and elliptical

 These flowers bloom either alone or in pairs of two

 vaise to khubaani ke baheri chhilka kaaphi mulaayam hota he, lekin us par kabhi-kabhi bahut maheen bal bhi ho sakate hai
 The seeds of apricot are sealed in a khaki or hard colored kernel in the middle of the fruit

 Turkey has the highest number of apricots in the world, producing 390,000 tonnes of apricot in 2005
 madhya-purv turki main sthit malatya kshetra khubaaniyon ke liye mashhoor he or turki kii lagbhag aadhi paidaavaar yaheen se aati he
 Iran is followed by Turkey, where 285,000 tonnes of apricots were grown in 2005
 khubaani ek thande pradesh kaa paudha he or adhik garmi main yaa to mar jaataa he yaa fal paidaa nahin karata
 In India, news is produced in the hilly regions of the north, such as Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, etc
 sukhi khubaani ko bharat ke pahari ilaaqon main baadaam, akhrot or nyoje kii tarah khubaani ko ek kushk mewa samajha jaataa he or kaafii maatra main khaaya jaataa he
 In many areas of Kashmir and Himachal, dry apricots are called Kisht or Kisht
 mana jaataa he ke kashmir ke kishtawar kshetra kaa naam isiilie padaa kyonki prachinkaal main yah jagah sukhi khubaniyon ke liye prasiddh thi
 Apricot puree can be used as a fat substitute
 isaki puri aloobookhaare kii puri kii tarah bahut gahare rang kii nahin hoti or na hi seb kii puri kii tarah jal kii adhikta vaali hi hoti he
 Apricots are thought to originate in countries in the northwest, especially the United States
 kuch samay baad yah fal turki pahunchaa
 At this time there is the highest production of apricots
 khubaani kaa rang jitna chamkila hoga, usamen vitamin-si or i or potacium kii maatra utani hi adhik hogi
 Dry apricot contains 12 times iron, seven times dietary fiber and five times vitamin a compared to fresh apricots
 sunahari khubaani main kachche aam va chini mila kar bahut swaadisht chatnee banati he
 Apricot drink is also very tasty, which is called 'apricot Nectar'
 khubaani kii guthli ke andar kaa beej ek chote baadaam kii tarah hota he or khubaani kii bahut sari qismon main iskaa swaad ek mithe baadaam sa hota he
 It can be eaten, but it contains a poisonous substance called a hydrocyanic acid
 bacchon ko khubaani kaa beej nahin khilaanaa chahie
 This is fine for elders, but they too should not eat more than 5-10 seeds at a time
 khubaani kai rangon main aati he, jaise safed, kaale, gulabi or bhure rang
 The color has no effect on the taste of apricots, but the carotene that it contains definitely makes a difference

 The Buddhist monk Guru Rinpoche's visit to Sikkim in the 8th century is the most ancient description related to Sikkim
 abhilekith he ki unhone buddha dharm kaa prachaar kiya, sikkim ko ashish diya tathaa kuch sadiyon pashchaat aane vaale rajya kii bhavishyavaanee kari
 It is believed that in the 14th century, Khye Bumsa, a prince of the Minyak palace of Kham in eastern Tibet, was ordered to go south one night according to divine vision
 inke hi vanshajon ne sikkim kii rajtantr kii sthapana kari
 In 1642 Phuntsong Namgyal, the fifth descendant of Khye, was declared the first Chogyal of Sikkim by three Buddhist monks who came from the north, east and south
 is prakaar sikkim main rajtantr kaa armbh hua
 Tensung Namgyal, son of Phuntsong Namgyal, took over the charge in 1670 after him
 tensung ne rajdhani ko yuksom se rabdentse sthaanantarit kar diya
 In 1700, there was a Bhutan invasion of Sikkim with a half-sister of Chogyal, who was denied the throne
 tibetiyon kii sahayata se chogyal ko raaj-gaddi punah saunp di gayi
 Between 1717 and 1733, Sikkim faced several invasions of Nepal and Bhutan, which eventually led to the fall of Rabdentse

 yadhyapi, angrejon dwaara morang pradesh main kar lagu karne ke kaaran sikkim or angreji shashan ke bich sambandhon main kadavaahat aa gayi
 In 1849, two English officers, Sir Joseph Dalton and Dr
 Archibald Campbell, of whom the latter was responsible for relations between Sikkim and the British Government, arrived in the mountains of Sikkim without permission or notice
 in donon afasaron ko sikkim sarkaar dwaara bandhi bana liya gaya

 At the time of the First World War, from 1914–1918, the National Defense Council by Luther Gulick performed its important work
 1960–62 i
 ke bich unhone 'institute of Public Administration' neuyark ke adhyaksh ke rup main kaary kiya
 Luther Gulick served as a professor as well as an administrative consultant
 luther gulik ko saamaanya prashasan ke saath-saath sainik or audyogic prashasan kaa anubhav evam gyaan tha
 This was the reason that he formulated various theories
 luther gulik kaa yogadan lekhan ke kshetra main bhi kam nahin he
 He authored several books on administration and management and got articles published
 unki rachanaaon main pramukh hai- Luther Gulick's contribution to public administration can be presented under the following headings - lok prashasan ek gatisheel evam vikasshil vishay he
 Therefore, ensuring its work area is difficult and difficult
 yah rajya se juda hua vishay he or rajya ke samaksh vibhinn prakaar kii nayi nayi samasyaayein aati rahati he, jinka nidaan use dhundhna hota he
 In terms of achieving the goal of public welfare state, the field of public administration has become more extensive and its importance has also increased tremendously
 lok prashasan ke kaary–kshetra ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke bich matbhed kaayam he
 As far as Luther Gulick's opinion is concerned, he has included the functions of the executive branch of administration in addition to the normal functions in public administration
 luther gulik ke dwaara prashasan tathaa lok prashasan ko spasht karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 Regarding administration, Luther Gulick says that administration is concerned with the completion of work and the fulfillment of the set objectives
 lok prashasan ko paribhaashit karte hue unhone kaha he ki- Luther Gulick in his book titled Papers on the Science of Administration, presents the list of principles of organization as follows - kaary kaa vibhaajan Departmental organizations basis padsopan Consignment coordination samitiyon ke antargat samanvay Decentralization odash kii ekta Line and staff pratyaayojan Area of control luther gulik ne mukhya karypalak ke kaaryon ko 'postcarb formule' ke dwaara spasht karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 Gulick's view that the postcarb formula considers the functional aspects of the functions of the chief executive
 formule kaa prayek shabd kisi na kisi gatividhi ko adhivyakt karata he, jo is prakaar he : p – Planning Planning o–organising sanghathan s – Slatping Personnel Class d–directing nirdesh dena"'c"'- Control
 co–coordinator samanvay r – Reporting Report b–budgeting bajet For the activeness, efficiency and success of the organization, it is necessary to divide it into various departments and subdivisions as per convenience
 iske saath yah bhi aavashyak hota he ki sanghathan ke vibhajit vibhaag yaa up–vibhaag milakar kaaryon ko sampadit karen
 It is in this context that Luther Gulick outlines four major grounds for the creation of departmental organizations
 vishesh uddeshy yaa kaary kii drushti se jab kisi sanghathan kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he tab ise sanghathan kaa kaaryaatmak siddhant kaha jaataa he
 In fact, the main basis of departmental organizations is work or goals
 sabhi prakaar ke sanghathanon ke nirmaan main isi kii pradhanta hoti he
 Luther Gulick laid the process as the second basis for the creation of a departmental organization
 prakriya kaa taatpary us yogyata or gyaan se he jiskaa sambandh vishesheekaran kii pravriti se hota he
 The organization is divided by keeping the process in mind, for example - medical department, education department, technology department etc
 vibhageeya sanghathan ke nirmaan ke tritiy aadhaar ke rup main luther mulik ne vyaktiyon ko rakhaa he
 The specialty of all types of organizations is that they should provide all kinds of services and facilities to the people in whose organization the organization has been formed
 punarvaas vibhaag, saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag, alpsankhyakon ke liye kalyaan santhaan aadi kii sthapana kaa aadhaar vyakti hi hote he
 Luther Gulick also considered the location a cornerstone of departmental organization
 vibhaagon kii sthapana main sthaan kaa mahatv bahut hota he
 In the organization the area of control, unity of command, coordination and communication etc
 are affected by the location

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 paaltu pashu chikitsa Alternative medicine methods are as diverse in their basic principles as in their procedures
 These methods are based on traditional medical practice, folk wisdom, spiritual belief or new methods of healing
 jin nyaayadhikaar kshetron main vaikalpik chikitsa paddatiyaan paryaapt rup se prachlit hon, vahaan unhen kanoonee license mil saktaa he tathaa unhen viniyamit kiya ja saktaa he
 The claims of physicians of alternative medicine are generally not accepted by the medical community, because evidence-based assessment of safety and efficacy is either unavailable or not met for these methods
 If scientific research evidences the safety and efficacy of an alternative medicine method, it becomes a mainstream medical practice and no longer "alternative" and is therefore widely adopted by traditional practitioners
 chunki vaikalpik chikitsa takneekon main sakshya kii kami hoti he yaa ve pareekshan main baar-baar asafal rahati hai, isliye kuch logon ne inhen gaiyr-sakshya aadhaarit vaikalpik chikitsa paddatiyon ke rup main yaa puri tarah se ek achikitsiya paddati ke rup main paribhaashit karne kii salaah di he
 Some researchers believe that there will be a problem in defining CAM based on evidence-based methods, as CAM has been tested and believes that many mainstream methods have also found a lack of convincing evidence
 isaki vyapaktaa ko dekhne ke liye 13 deshon main kiye gayi adhyayanon kii, varsh 1998 main kii gai ek suvyavasthit samiksha main yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya ki cancer ke lagbhag 31% rogi poorak tathaa vaikalpik chikitsa ke kisi na kisi rup kaa prayog karte hai

 Integrated medicine is the combination of traditional and complementary medicine emphasizing prevention and lifestyle changes
 vaikalpik yaa poorak chikitsa paddati ke liye koi spasht tathaa ek samaan paribhaasha nahin he
 : 17 In Western culture, it is often defined as a treatment system that "does not fall within the domain of traditional medicine" or that "has not been seen as equally effective
" ” The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine describes CAM as "a diverse set of diverse medical and health protection systems, systems and products that are not part of existing traditional medical practice"
 cocran compcementary medicine field ne paaya ki jise ek desh main poorak yaa vaikalpik chikitsa maanate hai, use hi duusare deshon main paaramparik chikitsa paddati mana ja saktaa he

 David M
 Isenberg, an integrative medical researcher, defines it as "medical interventions that are not widely taught in American medical institutions or commonly found in American hospitals," NCCAM believes if earlier unproven treatments If used and safe, they can be included in traditional medicine

 kasileth ne is maamle ko is prakaar sankshepit kiya he, “jaisaa ki cam ko mukhya dhara kii chikitsa main samaklit karne yaa "vaikalpik" chikitsa ke liye alag NIH anusandhan sanstha banane kaa prayaas chal rahaa he, mukhyadhara ke sabhi chikitsak cam ke saath sahaj nahin he
 " naishanal science foundation ne vaikalpik chikitsa ko “aisi sabhi chikitsa paddatiyaan jinhen vaigyanik vidhiyon dwaara prabhaavshaalee sabit na kiya gaya ho,” ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 The Institute of Medicine in the year 2005 defined complementary and alternative medicine methods as non-effective therapeutic method in a particular culture and historical period
 cocran colaboreshan tathaa aadhikarik sarkari nikaayon, jaise euke department of health ne aisi hi ek paribhaasha apanaai he
 Proponents of evidence-based medical practices, such as Cochrane Collaboration use terms such as alternative medicine, but they agree that all treatments, whether they are "mainstream" or "alternative" methods, meet the standards of scientific methods
 Should be done according to mukhya dhara ke kai vaigyanikon tathaa chikitsakon ne vaikalpik chikitsa paddatiyon par tippanee kii he or unki aalochana kii he
 There has been a debate among medical researchers as to whether a treatment method can be properly classified as 'alternative medicine'
 kuch shodhakarta daawa karte hai ki chikitsa paddati keval vahi he, jiskaa samuchit rup se pareekshan kiya gaya he, tathaa jiskaa pareekshan na hua ho vah koi paddati nahin
 They believe that health care practices should be based primarily on scientific evidence
 yadi kisi chikitsa paddati kaa kadaa pareekshan hua ho or vah surakshit tathaa prabhavi pai gai ho, to paaramparik chikitsa paddati use apana legi, chaahe use aarambh main ‘vaikalpik’ hi kyon na mana gaya ho
 Thus it is possible for a method to change classes based on the lack of detailed information about its effectiveness or lack thereof

 lundaurg shaamil hai
 Stephen Barrett, founder and operator of Quakewatch, believes that the therapy called "alternative" method should be reclassified as correct, experimental, or questionable
 Here for 'right' they talk about methods that have clear evidence of safety and effectiveness, experimental ones, which give authentic evidence for effectiveness even after being unproven, and doubtful, which are scientifically truthful Be baseless without base
 They are concerned that since some "alternative" therapies have their own merits, for the rest it is assumed that they will also have benefits, but most are useless
 ve kehete hai ki ant kii niti he ki kabhi yah nahin kahana chahie ki amuk paddati kargar nahin he, balki ek alag sanskaran yaa khuraaq ke kuch alag parinaam ho sakate hai
 Edjard Ernst, a professor of complementary medicine, finds evidence of many alternative techniques to be weak, non-existent, or negative, but he says evidence for others is available, particularly for some herbs and acupuncture
 ek vikasvaadi jaivvaigyanik richard dockins vaikalpik chikitsa ko is prakaar paribhaashit karte hai, “paddatiyon kaa ek samooh, jiskaa pareekshan na kiya ja sake, pareekshan se inkaar kare, yaa pareekshan main lagaataar asafal ho
” ve kehete hai ki yadi takanic ko kisi uchit pradarshit pareekshanon main prabhavi paaya jaataa he, to vah vaikalpik na hokar chikitsa ban jaati he
 In a letter from four Nobel laureates and other prominent scientists, the National Institute of Health condemned critical thinking and lack of scientific caution, which promotes research in alternative medicine
 varsh 2009 vaigyanikon ke ek samooh ne naishanal centre for complimentary and alternetive medicine ko band karne kaa prastaav diya
 He said that many of the studies were based on unconventional understanding of physiology and diseases and their effects were either no or very few

 Protection from ultraviolet radiation is the most comprehensive protection, which can cause short-term and long-term eye problems such as photokeratitis, snow blindness, cataracts, petriceps and various types of eye cancers
 Medical experts advise people about the importance of wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from UV; For proper protection, experts suggested sunglasses that could reflect or filter up to 400–1 nm UVA and UVB light up to 99–100%
 Sunglasses that meet this requirement are often marked "UV 400"
 yah europea sangh dwaara vyapak rup se prayog kiye jane vaale maanakon se thodaa adhik surakshatmak he, jiske tahat keval 380 nm tak ke vikiran ke 95% bhaag tak ko parilakshith yaa filter kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Sunglasses do not protect the eyes from the permanent damage that occurs when looking directly at the sun, even during a solar eclipse
 haal hi main, ucch urja drishyman prakaash ko umr-sambandhi aankh kii macula ke vyapajanan ke liye zimmedaar tehraaya gaya; isse pehle is baat par bahes vyaapt tha ki kya "blue bloking" yaa ember rang main range hue lens surakshatmak prabhaav pradaan karte hai
 Some manufacturers already designed it to block blue light; The insurance company Suva, which covers most Swiss employees, asked ophthalmologists around Charlotte Rheme ETH Zurich to develop rules for blue bleeding, which led to the recommendation of a minimum of 95% blue light
 Sunglasses are especially important for children, as it is believed that their ophthalmic lenses transmit far more HEV light than adults
 kuch atakalein hai ki dhoop ke chashme vastav main twachaa ke cancer ko badhaava detii hai
 This is because the eyes are tricked to produce less melanocyte stimulating hormone in the body

 The only "visible" quality test for sunglasses is their fitting
 These lenses should fit on the face in such a way that the least amount of unwanted light reaches the eyes from its edges or from the top or bottom, but not even close enough that the eyelids will cause spots on the lens
 To protect against "unwanted light" coming from the edges, the lens should fit near the forehead and / or be inserted into wide temple arms or leather blinders
 dhoop ke chashmon dwaara pradaan kii jane vaali suraksha ko "dekhnaa" sambhav nahin he
 Darker lenses do not automatically filter out harmful ultraviolet radiation and blue light when compared to light
 anupyukt gahare rang ke lens anupyukt halke rang ke lenson se adhik hanikaarak hote hai kyonki ve putliyon ko adhik khulne ke liye uksaati hai
 As a result, most of the unfiltered radiation enters the eye
 vinirmaan praudyogiki ke aadhaar par, paryaapt surakshatmak lensen adhik yaa kam prakaash ko roak sakati hai, jo gahare yaa halke lenson ko parinamit karti hai
 The color of the lens is also not a guarantee
 vibhinn rangon ke lens paryaapt UV sangrakshan pradaan kar sakate hai
 In the context of blue light, this color gives at least the first indication: blue blocking lenses are usually yellow or brown while blue or gray lenses may not provide the necessary protection from blue light
 lekin, har ek pile yaa bhure rang ke lens paryaapt nile prakaash ko roak paane main sakasham nahin hote
 durlabh maamalon main, lens bahut adhik maatra main nile prakaash ko filter kar paata he, jo rang drushti ko prabhavit kar saktaa hai or yah yatayaat ke liye tab khatarnaak ho saktaa he jab rangeen sanket thik se pahchaan main nahin aate
 High prices cannot guarantee adequate protection as no correlation between high prices and increased UV protection has been demonstrated
 1995 main kiye gaye ek adhyayan ne akhya di ki mahange brands or dhruvikrut dhoop ke chashme ishtatam UVA sangrakshan kii guarantee nahin dete hai
 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also stated that "occupants cannot rely on price as an indicator of quality"
 a survey also found that a pair of generic glasses priced at $ 6
95 offer slightly better protection than expensive Salvatore Ferragamo colors
 jabaki bina range hue chashme kabhi-kabhi hi drushti sudhaarney yaa kisi kii ankhon kii raksha karne ke vyaavhaarik prayojan ke bina pahane jate hai, dhoop ke chashme kai or kaarnon ke liye lokapriy hue hai or kabhi kabhi inhen ghar ke andar yaa raat main bhi pahana jaataa he
 Sunglasses can also be worn to hide your eyes
 ve ankhon ke sampark ko asambhav banaata he, jo bina dhoop kaa chashma pahane logon ko daraa saktaa hai; ankhon ke sampark se bachanaa pahanane vaale ke algaav ko bhi pradarshit karata he, jo kuch halkon main vaanchhneeya "kool" mana jaataa he
 Eye contact can be avoided more effectively by using reflective sunglasses
 dhoop ke chashme kaa istemaal bhaawanaaon ko chhipaane ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he; jo jhapakati hui palkon ko chupaane se lekar rone or uske parinamswaroop apni laal ankhon ko chupaane tak ho sakati hai
 In all cases, concealing your eyes has the implication of an unspoken communication
 fishan ke prati rujhaan bhi dhoop ke chashme pahanane kaa ek or kaaran ho saktaa he, vishesh rup se diziner dhoop ke chashme
 vishesh akritiyon vaale dhoop ke chashme fishan sahaayak ke rup main prachlan main ho sakate hai
 Fashion trends can also affect the 'cool' image of sunglasses
