 After this Hindu law was divided into those parts whose names we are familiar with today
 inamen mitakshra or daybhag pramukh hai
 Mitakshara Yajnavalkya is the commentary of Vigyaneshwar on Smriti, which was composed in the 11th century
 jimootivaahan ne 13veen or 15veen shatabdi ke bich main daybhag kii rachana kii jisamen sabhi smritiyon kii baaten shaamil hai
 The Dibandha law only operates in Bengal and with it, there is a circulation of texts called "daityattva" and "dya-karma-sangraha"

 anvedakar ne desh ke anek vidhipanditon ke sahyog se apurv vidhirachana kii lekin shastreey paribhaasha main in logon ko vidhikaar nahin kaha ja sakegaa
 Similarly, the famous judge Shri Radhavinod Pal and the judges of the Supreme Court are legal pundits and give the system of justice and law
 inkaa bhi shastreey paribhaasha main vidhikaar nahin kaha ja saktaa
 It is less likely that a country has many rights in time

 But some rulers created special types of statutes, they are considered as jurisdictions

 This applies to the ten principles of Hammurabi, Samhita and Moses
 jastinian to swayan yah sweekaar karata he ki samasamyik adhinium or nyaayadhishon kii vyavasthaaon ke aadhaar par usne vidhirachana kii

 Most Sunni Muslims of India follow the Hanafi method
 shiya sampradaay ke musalmaan hazrat mohammad or hazrat ali ko hi apana vidhikaar maanate hai
 Even if the religious law makers of Christianity are considered to be an authority, Innocent III created a code called "corpus Juris Cannissi" and Grigory Navam gave a number of legal arrangements, so both can be classified as legal

 brajabhasha vikram kii 13veen shatabdi se lekar 20veen shatabdi tak bharat ke madhyadesh kii mukhya saahitiyik bhashaa evam saath hi saath samast bharat kii saahitiyik bhashaa thi
 This 'brajbhasha', a former form of Hindi widely used throughout India with various local linguistic co-ordinates, is still spoken today in Agra, Dhaulpur, Mathura and Aligarh districts which we call as 'central Brajbhasha'
 Can also call
 brajabhasha main hi prarambh main hindi-kavy kii rachana hui
 All devout poets, ritual poets have written their compositions in this language, among which Surdas, Rahim, Rasakhan, Keshav, Ghananand, Bihari, etc
 are prominent
 bhashaa or style kii drushti se shauraseni yaa pashchimi apbhransh kaa ek vyapak kshetra tha
 Brajbhasha inherited the boundaries of this broad area in a way
 brajabhasha kaa style-rup bhashaa-kshetra se kahin adhik vistrut simaaon kaa sparsh karata he
 Some authors have described its expansion by the name Brajbhasha
 'vansh bhaskar' ke rachayita surajmal ne brajabhasha pradesh dilli or gwalior ke bich mana he
 Mirza Khan, the author of 'tuhfatul Hind', mentions the area of brajbhasha as "the language spoken in Braj and its neighborhood
" gwalior tathaa chandwar bhi usamen sammilit hai
 The Doab of ganga-yamuna is also an area of braj Bhasha
 lallujilaal ke anusaar brajabhasha kaa kshetra "brajabhasha vah bhashaa he, jo braj, jila gwalior, bharatpur, bateshwar, bhadaavar, antarveda tathaa bundelkhand main boli jaati he
 The word in it signifies the region of Mathura
 ' lallujilaal ne yah bhi likhaa he ki braj or gwalior kii brajabhasha shuddh evam parinishthit he
 Grierson wrote Brajbhasha-bima as follows
 "mathura centre he
 Brajbhasha is spoken in the south till Agra, Bharatpur, Dhaulpur and Karauli
 gwalior ke pashchimi bhaagon tathaa jaipur ke purvi bhaag tak bhi yahi prachlit he
 In the north, its boundary reaches the eastern part of Gurgaon
 uttar-purv main isaki seemayen doaab tak hai
 Bulandshahar, Aligarh, Etah and Badayu of Gangapar, Bareilly and Terai Parganas of Nainital are also in this area
 madhyavarti doaab kii bhashaa ko antarvedi naam diya gaya he
 Intuitive areas include Agra, Etah, Mainpuri, Farrukhabad and Etawah districts, but the languages of Etawah and Farrukhabad are Kannauji according to them, the rest is Braj-speaking
 ' Kellag has written that Brajbhasha is spoken in the entire Upper Doab and the valleys of ganga-yamuna, to the northeast of the Rajputana dialects
 dow dhirendra verma ne grearsan dwaara nirdisht kannauji kshetra ko braji ke kshetra se alag nahin mana he
 On the basis of their survey, they have called it Braj-speaking area up to Kanpur
 unke anusaar uttar pradesh ke mathura, aligarh, agra, bulandshahr, eta, mainpuri, badaayun tathaa bareli ke jile -- punjab or gudgaanv jile kaa purvi bhaag -- rajasthan main bharatpur, dhaulpur, karauli tathaa jaipur kaa purvi bhaag -- madhyabhaarat main gwalior kaa pashchimi bhaag braji ke kshetra main aate hai
 Since Grierson Sahib's view is not valid to the author that Kannauji is an independent dialect, the districts of Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur, Farrukhabad, Hardoi, Etawah and Kanpur of Uttar Pradesh have also been included in the Braj Bhasha region
 is prakaar boli jane vaali brajabhasha kaa kshetra atyant vistrut thahartaa he
 In a way, most of the ancient Madhya Pradesh is included in it
 brajabhasha kavyabhasha ke rup main pratishthit ho gai
 Poetry was composed in it for many centuries
 saamaanya brajabhasha-kshetra kii simaaon kaa ulanghan karke brajabhasha- style kaa ek vrihattar kshetra bana
 This was predicted by Acharya Bhikhari Das, the poet of Reetikal
 unhone spasht kaha ki brajabhasha kaa parichay braj se baahar rahane vaale kaviyon se bhi mil saktaa he
 It should not be understood that Brajbhasha is sweet-beautiful
 iske saath sanskrit or farsi hi nahin, anya bhashaaon kaa bhi put rahata he
 Yet the peculiarity of the Brajbhasha style remains to be seen
 isse yah bhi siddh hota he ki brajabhasha style anek bhashaaon se samanvit thi
 In fact, by the middle of the 16th century, the mixed style of Braj Bhasha had become the poetry language of the whole of Madhya Pradesh
 vistaar main bhakthi andolan kaa bhi haath rahaa
 In a way the style of krishna-bhakti became orthodox
 pan vishwanath prasad mishra ne anek pradeshon ke braj bhashaa bhakt-kaviyon kii bhugolic sthiti is prakaar prakat kii he -- "braj kii vanshi- dhwani ke saath apane padon kii anupam jhankaar milakar naachne vaali mira rajasthan kii thim, namdev maharashtra ke the, narsi gujarat ke the, bharatendu harishchandra bhojpuri bhashaa kshetra ke the
 


 There are many talented poets of Braj Bhasha in Bhojpuri, Magahi and Maithili language areas in Bihar
 purv main bengal ke kaviyon ne bhi brajabhasha main kavita likhi
 ' pashchim main rajasthan to brajabhasha shaileyon kaa prayog prachur maatra main karata hi rahaa 1 or bhi pashchim main gujarat or kuccha tak brajabhasha style samaadrut thi
 Maharao Lakhpat of Kutch was a great scholar
 brajabhasha ke prachaar or prashikshan ke liye inhone ek vidhyalay bhi kholaa tha
 In this way, the spread of Brajbhasha in the medieval period was not only in Braj and its surrounding areas, but also in the previous regions
 bengal, maharashtra, gujarat, kathiyawad evam kuccha aadi main bhi brajabhasha kii rachanaayen hui
 There were two situations of expansion of Braj Bhasha style
 pratham sthiti bhashaa vaigyanik itihaas ke kram se utpann hui
 When Western or Madhya Pradesh language started violating its geographical boundaries due to many reasons, then it started to take the form of a distinct language style, coordinated with the local forms
 jin kshetron main yah kathy bhashaa na hokar keval sahitya main prayukt kritrim, mishrit or vishisht rup main dhal gai or vishisht avasaron, sandarbhon yaa kavy rupon main rudh ho gai, un kshetron ko style kshetra mana jayega
 Genre-area grows with the help of pre-language expansion or genre extension
 pashchimi yaa madhyadeshi apbhransh ke uttarkalin rupon kii vistruti isi prakaar hui
 The second situation was present when the regional expansion of the language-style of the pre-tradition formed the background and the historical and objective reasons for the expansion of the stylistic region also became present

 In the recent past, the use of this script was reduced due to the use of Bangla script, but now its use is gaining momentum again

 Some people omit the initial 0, replacing the sequence with two 1's
 ganitiya sandarbh main, fibonachi sankhya ke f n anukram ko aavartan sambandh dwaara darshaya ja saktaa he- And, fibonachi anukram kaa naam pisa ke leonardo fibonachi ke naam par rakhaa gaya, jo fibonachi ke naam se jane jate the
 The 1202 book Liber Abeki, written by Fibonacci, introduced this sequence in West European mathematics, although this sequence has already been described in Indian mathematics
 fibonachi anukram pracheen bharat main bahut prasiddh tha, jahaan ise europe main prachlit hone se bahut samay pehle hi chand vigyaan main lagu kiya gaya tha
 The credit for its development is given to Pingala, Virhanka, Gopal, and Hemachandra
 fibonachi anukram, n -1 lambaai ke namoonay main s ko jod kar, yaa n -2 lambaai ke namoonay main l ko jod kar taiyaar kiya jaataa he; or chand-shastriyon ne darshaya ki n lambaai ke namoonay, anukram main pichhali do sankhyaon kaa yoga hai
 Donald Knuth reviewed this work in The Art of Computer Programming
 pashchim main, pisa ke leonardo ne apane liber abek main fibonachi ke rup main gyaat is anukram kaa adhyayan kiya
 He considered the development of an ideal rabbit population, assuming that: iskaa niyam yah he ki khargoshon kii ek jodi apane jivan-kaal main 2 jodi paidaa karti he or mar jaati he
 Suppose the population is f in n months
 is samay, keval ve khargosh, jo n - 2 maheene main jivit rahe the, prajnanksham hai or santan paidaa karte hai, to f jode maujuuda aabaadi f main jud jate hai
 Thus, the total is f = f + F
 n = 0, 1, 2, 


, 20 ke liye Fn ke rup main bhi suchit kii jane vaali pehali 21 fibonachi sankhyaayein hai: Using the rotation relation, the sequence can also be extended to negative index n
 The result satisfies the equation is prakaar puraa anukram he Each third number of the sequence is even and typically, each kth number of the sequence is a multiple of Fk
 Thus the Fibonacci sequence is an example of a divisibility sequence
 Indeed, the Fibonacci sequence satisfies the apparent divisibility property
 raikhik aavartan dwaara paribhaashit prayek anukram kii tarah, fibonachi sankhya kaa ek purna-sutara hal he
 yah binet sutara ke naam se janaa jaataa he, haalanki use pehle abrahim di moivre ke rup main janaa gaya tha: 
 fibonachi prayaavartan The determinant of the golden ratio is similar to the following equation jise prayaavartan ke utpaadak bahupad ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The solution of the above equation is x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin {matrix} x ^ {2} = x + 1, \ end {matrix}} \ ,} and xn - 1 { \ 
 Multiplying by displaystyle x ^ {n-1} \ ,} shows the following: paribhaasha ke anusaar φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, sameekaran kaa mul he or doosraa mul he 1 − φ = − 1 / φ 
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ ,=-1 / \ varphi \ ,
} 
 isliye: And donon φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^{n}} tathaa n = n { \ displaystyle ^{n}=^{n}} aisi jyamitiya shrinkhlaayein hai, jo fibonachi prayaavartan kaa samaadhaan karti hai
 pehali shrinkhalaa ghaataanki rup se badhati he; duusari, ghaataanki rup se, ekantar chihnon sahit, shunya kii ore le jaati he
 chunki fibonachi prayaavartan raikhik he, in do shrinkhalaaon ke kisi bhi raikhik sangyojan se bhi prayaavartan kaa samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 ye raikhik sangyojan, ek do-aiami raikhik vector antar taiyaar karte hai; mul fibonachi anukram is antar main paaya ja saktaa he
 The series of linear combinations φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n { \ displaystyle ^ {n}}, including the coefficients a and b, can be defined by is prakaar paribhaashit sabhi shrinkhlaayein fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karti hai Where f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 0} and f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 1} yields a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a = 1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} and b = - 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle give b = -1 / { \ sqrt {5}}}, resulting in the same binet formula from which we started Was It has been shown that this formula fulfills the Fibonacci alternation
 In addition, an explicit investigation can be done: or Proving the original arrival questions, certify that isliye, kinhin do praarambhik mulyon ke liye, sangyojan a, b { \ displaystyle a,b} ko is tarah paaya ja saktaa he ki falan f a, b { \ displaystyle F_{a,b} \ ,}, anukram ke liye sateek purna sutara he
 Since for all n ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle n \ geq 0} | 1 - 4 n / 5 = 0 { \ displaystyle k> = 0} is found for integers iske vipareet, Sometimes the integer sums on the inverse Fibonacci numbers can be calculated in terms of theta function
 For example, we can write the sum of every odd-exponential Fibonacci number as follows or vargakar vyutkram fibonachi sankhya ke yoga ko nimna rup main If we add 1 to each Fibonacci number in the first sum, there will also be a complete formula
 or vargakar fibonachi sankhya kaa acha vargeekrut yoga he, jo sunahare anupaat kaa vyutkram detaa he, Such results seem correct to see that a complete formula for the simple sum of inverse Fibonacci numbers can be found, but no such has yet been known
 Despite that, the inverse Fibonacci constant richard andre-jianin dwaara aparimey sabit kiya gaya he
 The Fibonacci prime number is a Fibonacci number that is prime
 The first few are: hazaron ankon ke saath fibonachi abhajya sankhya pai gai hai, lekin yah gyaat nahin he ki kya kai aparimit sankhyaayein maujuud hai
 un sabamein ek abhajya ghaataank hona chahie, sivaay f 4 = 3
 f kn can be divided by f n and therefore joint Fibonacci numbers are also arbitrarily in vogue due to the arbitrary number of joint numbers in circulation
 1, 8 or 144 ke apwaad sahit prayek fibonachi sankhya kaa ek abhajya gunak he, jo ki kisi chote fibonachi sankhya kaa gunak nahin he
 Only 144 are non-negligible squares Fibonacci numbers
 Ettila Petho proved in 2001 that only a limited number of perfect power Fibonacci numbers exist
 In 2006, Y
 Beugaud, M
 Mignot and S
 Siksek proved that only 8 and 144 are non-negligible perfect powers
 f 6 = 8 se mahattar koi fibonachi sankhya, abhajya sankhya se na to ek adhik yaa ek kam he
 Any consecutive three Fibonacci numbers, taking two at a time, have been proportional prime numbers: ie, or saamanytah, The divisibility of Fibonacci numbers by the prime p is related to the Legendre sign { \ displaystyle \ ; \ left} which is assumed to be as follows: agar p ek abhajya sankhya he, to f p ≡ and f p − ≡ 0 
 { \ displaystyle F_{p} \ equiv \ left{ \ pmod {p}} \ ; \ ;{ \ mbox{ and }} \ ; \ ; \ ;f_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p}}
} for example, yah gyaat nahin he ki koi abhajya p aise maujuud he ki f p − ≡ 0 { \ displaystyle F_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p^{2 xxrep 4 } is tarah kii abhajya sankhyaon ko waal-san-san abhajya sankhya kaha jayega
 Also, if p ≠ 5 is an odd prime number, then: sabhi maamalon ke udhaaharan: For odd n, all odd prime divisors of f n are ≡ 1, indicating that all odd divisors of f n are ≡ 1
 udhaaharan ke liye, f 1 = 1, f 3 = 2, f 5 = 5, f 7 = 13, f 9 = 34 = 2 × 17, f 11 = 89, f 13 = 233, f 15 = 610 = 2 × 5 × 61 ∑ k = n n + 9 f k = 11 f n + 6 { \ displaystyle \ sum _{k=n}^{n+9}f_{k}=11f_{n+6}} For example, let n = 1: f 1 + f 2 + 


 + f 10 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 = 143 = 11×13n = 2:F2+F3+

 The angle of deviation, adjacent to 137
51 °, is the golden angle, which divides the circle into the golden ratio
 Because this ratio is irrational, there is no one else at the same angle from the center, side of a floret, so the florets are efficiently filled together
 Because the formula for the rational approximation of the golden ratio is F: F, the index in the nearest neighborhood of the floral number n is at n ± f for j based on the distance r from the center

 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats

 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The middle class consisted of moneylender merchants, teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, artists, employees etc
 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society

 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy

 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income

 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy

 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church

 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"

 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year

 In this, evils of governance, corruption of the church and inequality prevailing in every field were highlighted

 a section of thinkers was focused on the economic disorder and analysis prevailing in France at this time

 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages

 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya

 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor
 rashtriya sabha ne france kii prashasnic sanrachana main parivartan kiya
 The entire country was divided into 83 departments by abolishing the ancient provinces

 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians

 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed
 tritiy charan-1794-99 -“diarectory” kaa shashan vastutah neshnal kanvension ne ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan kar karypalika kaa uttardaayitv 5 sadasyeey “nideshak mandal” ko saunpa
 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges

 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong

 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged

 State and politics were separated from religion

 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system

 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
 France was the only country in entire Europe where there was a complete lack of a national spirit
 iske chalate bhi sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Effect of American freedom struggle- 1766 i
 main american swatantraaa sangram prarambh hua
 The American people revolted against England
 france ke sainikon ko bhi is swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila at: unhone yah mahasus kiya ki yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa prapti kii ja sakati he
 He also realized that freedom is possible only through freedom
 france lautne par unhone dekha kii jis swatantraaa ko liye unhonen america main yuddh kiya usee swatantraaa kaa france main purnat: abhaav he
 Hence, he became restless for the revolution here and tried to get freedom through war
 europe ke anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 Superiority of French Civilization france main hi kranti hone kaa ek vishisht kaaran yah tha ki yahan kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe rashtron kii apeksha adhik samrudh or vaibhav purna thi
 Even in terms of governance, the rule of France was highly organized
 france sampoorn europe sabhyataa or saanskriti kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states

 After attaining independence, many efforts were made by Kaka Kalelkar, Maithilisharan Gupta, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Seth Govindas and Vyauhar Rajendra Singh to give Hindi the status of national language
 jiske chalate inhone dakshin bharat kii kai yatraayen bhi kii
 Every year on 14 September, Hindi Day is celebrated all over the country to prevent the growing trend of English language and the neglect of Hindi
 aazaadee milane ke do saal baad 14 sitambar 1949 ko samvidhan sabha main ek mat se hindi ko rajbhasha ghoshit kiya gaya tha or iske baad se har saal 14 sitambar ko hindi diwas ke rup main manaaya jane laga
 With the Indian Constitution coming into force on 26 January 1950, the Official Language Policy came into force
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 343 ke tahat yah spasht kiya gaya he ki bharat kii rajbhasha hindi or lipi devanagari he
 The form of numerals used for the official purposes of the Union is the international form of Indian numerals
 hindi ke atirikt angreji bhashaa kaa prayog bhi sarkari kaamkaaj main kiya ja saktaa he
 It has also been arranged under Article 343 that for the period of 15 years from the time the Constitution came into force, that is, till the year 1965, the English language will continue to be used for all government functions of the Union
 yah vyavastha isliye kii gai thi ki is bich hindi na jaanane vaale hindi sikh jaayenge or hindi bhashaa ko prashasnic kaaryon ke liye sabhi prakaar se sakasham banaaya ja sakegaa
 Article 344 stated that after 5 years of the commencement of the constitution and then 10 years after that, the President would create a commission which, inter alia, about the progressive use of Hindi language in the official work of the Union and the official purposes of the Union
 Shall recommend to the President to prohibit the use of the English language for all or any of them
 ayog kii siforeeshon par vichaar karne ke liye is anuchhed ke khand 4 ke anusaar 30 sansad sadasyon kii ek samiti ke gathan kii bhi vyavastha kii gai
 Article 120 of the constitution states that the work of Parliament can be done in Hindi or in English
 varsh 1965 tak 15 varsh ho chukaa tha, lekin uske baad bhi angreji ko hataaya nahin gaya or anuchhed 334 main sansad ko yah adhikaar diya gaya ki vah 1965 ke baad bhi sarkari kaamkaaj main angrezi kaa prayog jari rakhane ke bare main vyavastha kar sakati he
 Both English and Hindi are the official languages of India
 26 janvari 1965 ko sansad main yah prastaav paarit hua ki "hindi kaa sabhi sarkari kaaryon main upyog kiya jayega, lekin uske saath saath angrezi kaa bhi sah rajbhasha ke rup main upyog kiya jayega
 "in 1967," Language Amendment Bill "was introduced in the Parliament
 iske baad angrezi ko anivaary kar diya gaya
 Hindi was not even discussed in Section 3 in this Bill
 iske baad angrezi kaa virodh shuru hua
 On 5 December 1967, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said in the Rajya Sabha that we will discuss this bill
 varsh 1990 main prakashit ek pustak "rashtrabhasha kaa sawaal" main shailesh matiani ji ne yah sawaal kiya tha ki ham 14 sitambar ko hi hindi diwas kyon manaate hai
 On this, Premnarayan Shukla ji had told the reason for this in Allahabad on Hindi Day, that on this day many important decisions were taken for the Hindi language
 is kaaran is din ko rashtriya parv ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 But they were not satisfied with this answer
 unhone kaha ki is din ko ham rashtrabhasha yaa rajbhasha diwas ke rup main kyon nahin manaate hai
 Along with this, Shailesh ji had declared celebrating Hindi Day on this day as a shameful hypocrisy

85 Holapur Handia is a village in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh
 raktaras main pittaranjak naamak ek rang hota he, jiske aadhiky se twachaa or shleshmik kala main pilaa rang aa jaataa he
 This condition is called Kamala or Jaundice
 saamanyat: raktaras main pittaranjak kaa str 1
0 pratishat yaa isse kam hota he, kintu jab isaki maatra 2
5 pratishat se upar ho jaati he tab kamla ke lakshan prakat hote hai
 Kamala itself is not a disease, but a symptom found in many diseases
 yah lakshan nanhen-nanhen bacchon se lekar 80 saal tak ke buudhon main utpann ho saktaa he
 If any defect occurs in any of the various metabolic processes of bile, then there is an excess of bile, which is caused by Kamala
 rakt main laal kanon kaa adhik nasht hona tathaa uske parinamswaroop apratyaksh pittaranjak kaa adhik bananaa bacchon main kamla, navjaat shishu main rakt-koshika-naash tathaa anya janmajaat, athwa arjeet, rakt-koshika-naash-janit raktaalpata ityadi rogon kaa kaaran hota he
 Even when the liver cells are unhealthy, the Kamala can occur, as they do not perform their natural function of the bile mixture and this pathology is the cause of well-known diseases like infectious hepatitis, hemorrhagic hepatitis and hepatic stones
 antat: yadi pittamarg main avrodh hota he to pittapranali main adhik pratyaksh pittaranjak kaa sangrah hota he or yah pratyaksh pittaranjak pun: rakt main shoshit hokar kamla kii utpatti karata he
 In pancreatic, head, gallbladder and gallbladder cancers, in the presence of cholelithiasis, congenital hepatic congestion and malformed hematopoiesis in the pathologies of the gallbladder are excreted in the liver
 yakrut ke aantarik rogon main yakrut ke bheetar kii vahiniyon main sankoch hota he, at: pratyaksh pittaranjak ke atirikt rakt main pratyaksh pittaranjak kaa aadhiky ho jaataa he
 In order to diagnose the actual disease, it is necessary to understand metabolic metabolism
 raktasancharan main rakt ke laal kan nasht hote rahete hai or is prakaar mukt hua haemoglobin reticulo-endothelial pranali main vibhinn mishrit prakriyaaon ke uparaant pittaranjak ke rup main parinat ho jaataa he, jo vistrut rup se sharir main fail jaataa hes, kintu iskaa adhik pariman pleeha main ikattha hota he
 This bile, mixed with a protein, is transmitted in blood
 isko apratyaksh pittaranjak kehete hai
 Normally healthy molecules of the liver take this indirect bile, and add glucuronic acid to it, which passes through the liver cells and goes to the small intestines as a direct bile by the bile
 aanton main yah pittaranjak eurobilinogen main parivartit hota he jiskaa kuch ansh shoshit hokar raktaras ke saath jaataa he or kuch bhaag, jo vishtha ko apana bhura rang pradaan karata he, vishtha ke saath sharir se nikal jaataa he
 In every case, the skin of the patient's eye becomes yellow, as well as the symptoms of the disease are also found
 vaise saamanyat: rogi kii tilli bad jaati he, paakhaana bhura yaa mitti ke rang kaa, zyada tathaa chikna hota he
 Hunger seems to decrease
 munh main dhaatu kaa swaad bana rahata he
 The pulse speed decreases
 vitamin 'ke' kaa shoshan thik se na ho paane ke kaaran tathaa raktasanchaar ko avaruddh hone lagata he
 Due to prolonged obstruction of the gallbladder, liver cells begin to be destroyed
 us samay rogi shithil, ardhvikshipt or kabhi-kabhi purna veikshipt ho jaataa he tathaa mar bhi jaataa he
 The cause of the disease is ascertained before the treatment of Kamala
 iske liye rakt kii jaanch, paakhaane kii jaanch tathaa yakrut-kii kaaryashakti kii jaanch karte hai
 This suggests that it is due to excess destruction of red particles in the blood, or liver cells are unhealthy or due to obstruction of the gallbladder
 pilia kii chikitsa main ise utpann karne vaale kaarnon kaa nirmulan kiya jaataa he jiske liye rogi ko aspataal main bhartee karana aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Some chillies, spices, oils, ghee, proteins stop completely, according to some people do not stop any food stuff completely, it is left to the patient to eat whatever they like
 aushadhi saadhaarant: tetraciclin tathaa niomicine di jaati he
 Sometimes caricositride is also used to prevent fibrosis and obstruction in the liver
 yakrut apana kaary thik se sampadit kare, iske liye davaayen di jaati hai jaise liv-52, hipaliv, livomin ityadi
 Kinetomine is used to remove the bile of Kamala from the blood
 kamla ke upachaar main laaparvaahee karne se jab rog purana ho jaataa he tab ek se ek badhkar nai pareshaaniyaan utpann hoti jaati hai or rogi vibhinn sthitiyon se gujarata hua kaalakwalit ho jaataa he
 Jaundice disease viral hepatitis yaa jondis ko saadhaarant: log pilia ke naam se jaanate hai
 This disease is caused by very micro virus
 shuru main jab rog dhimi gati se va maamuli hota he tab iske lakshan dikhaai nahin passage hai, parantu jab yah ugr rup dhaaran kar letaa he to rogi kii ankhe va nakhun pile dikhaai dene lagate hai, log ise pilia kehete hai
 Depending on the virus with which it occurs, there are mainly three types of jaundice, viral hepatitis A, viral hepatitis B, and viral hepatitis Naan a and Naan B
 rog kaa prasar kaise? This disease mostly occurs in places where people pay less or no attention to personal and environmental cleanliness
 bheed-bhaad vaale ilaakon main bhi yah zyada hota he
 Viral hepatitis b can occur in any season
 viral hepatitis e tathaa naae va naan bi ek vyakti se duusare vyakti ke najdiki sampark se hota he
 These viruses occur in the feces of the patient, it is spread by the feces of the person suffering from jaundice, contaminated water, milk or food
 aisa ho saktaa he ki kuch rogiyon kii aankh, nakhun yaa sharir aadi pile nahi dikh rahe hon parantu yadi ve is rog se grast ho to anya rogiyo kii tarah hi rog ko failaa sakate hai
 Viral hepatitis b is spread by the exchange and sexual activity of blood and blood and blood produced substances
 isamen vah vyakti ho detaa he use bhi rogi bana detaa he
 Here the person giving blood becomes a disease carrier
 bina ubali sui or sirange se injection lagane par bhi yah rog fail saktaa he
 Individuals with jaundice virus reach the human body directly with fingers and indirectly from the patient's feces or by flies
 isse swasthy manushya bhi rog grast ho jaataa he
 Disease where and when? e prakaar kaa pilia tathaa naan e va naan bi pilia saare sansar main paaya jaataa he
 Incidents of spread of this disease in the form of epidemics have also come to light in India
 haalanki yah rog varsh main kabhi bhi ho saktaa he parantu agast, sitambar va oktober mahinon main log is rog ke adhik shikaar hote hai
 Its spread decreases when winter starts
 rog ke lakshan:- Causes of jaundice disease are: - rog kise ho saktaa he? This disease can happen to a person of any stage
 haan, rog kii ugrata rogi kii avasthaa par jarur nirbhar karti he
 The symptoms of this disease are very severe on the pregnant woman and it gives them trouble for a long time
 isi prakaar navjaat shishuon main bhi yah bahut ugr hota he tathaa jaanaleva bhi ho saktaa he
 B-type viral hepatitis is more common to people receiving blood from occupational blood transfusions, and through sexual relationships with drug users and strangers
 rog kii jatiltalan:- The attack of this disease on most people is simple
 parantu kabhi-kabhi rog kii bheeshanta ke kaaran kathin liver dosha utpann ho jaataa he
 B-type jaundice is more serious and has more complications
 isaki mrityu dar bhi adhik hoti he
 the treatment:- rog kii rokthaam evam bachaav To avoid the outbreak of jaundice, it is important to keep in mind a few simple things: - swasthya kaaryakarta dhyaan den If there is a person in your area with symptoms of the disease, then advise to go to the doctor
 kshetra main vyaktigat safai va taatavaraniya swatchta ke bare main bataaye tathaa panchayat aadi se kuda, kachra, mel, mutr aadi ke nishkasana kaa intjaam karaane kaa prayaas karen
 Explain to the family members that the patient is well cared for
 rogi kii seva karne vaale ko samajhaayen ki haath acchhee tarah dhokar hi sab kaam karen
 Health workers can use syringes and needles for 20 minutes by boiling or disposable
 rogi kaa rakt lete samay va surgery karte samay dastaane pahanen va rakt ke sampark main aane vaale aujaaron ko acchhee tarah ubaalen
 Throw or destroy them in the appropriate place by putting disinfectants on blood and related bodily fluids
 jaraa si saavdhaanee-pilia se bachaav To understand the consequences of jaundice, the pathological processes that cause jaundice must be understood
 Jaundice is not a disease in itself, rather it is a symptom of many possible fundamental pathological processes that sometimes occur in the course of normal physiological functions of the metabolism of bilirubin
 jab laal rakt koshikaayen lagbhag 120 dinon kaa apana jivan kaal puraa kar leti hai, yaa jab ve kshatigrast ho jaati hai, to unki jhilliyaan kamjor ho jaati hai or unke katane-fatne kii sambhaavna ban jaati hai
 When each red blood cell passes through the lattice endocrine system, its membrane cell is too weak to hold it and the cell membrane is cut off
 haemoglobin sahit koshika kii antarvastu ko baad main rakt main sravit kar diya jaataa he
 Hemoglobin is fed bacteria by macrophages and is divided into its heme and globin parts
 globin vaala bhaag, jo ek protein hota he, amino amlon main avakramit hota he or pilia main isaki koi bhoomika nahin hoti he
 Then there are two reactions with the heme molecule
 pratham oxikaran pratikriya laghunetraguha sambandhi anzime heme oxijinez ke dwaara utprerit hoti he or iske parinamswaroop beliverdin, loha or carbon monooxide utpann hote hai
 The next step is the reduction of biliverdin to a yellow-colored tetrapyrrole pigment bilirubin by the cytoplasm enzyme biliverdine reductase
 This bilirubin is "unconjugated," "free" or "indirect" bilirubin
 pratidin prati kilogram lagbhag 4 milligram billirubin utpann hota he
 Most of these bilirubin comes from the process just described by the breakdown of hemi from dead red blood cells
 haalanki lagbhag 20 pratishat anya hemi sroton se aata he, jisamen aprabhavi laal rakt koshikaon kii utpatti or anya heme yukt protein, jaise ki manshapeshi sambandhit miloglobin or cytochrome kaa tootna shaamil he
 The unconjugated bilirubin then travels to the liver via the bloodstream
 kyonki yah billirubin ghulansheel nahin hota he, tathaapi, yah rakt ke madhyam se serum annsaar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Once reaching the liver, it is conjugated with glucuronic acid to become more soluble in water
 This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme udp-glucuronide transferase
 yah sanyugmit billirubin yakrut se sravit hokar pitt ke hisse ke rup main pittanli or mutrashayik naaliyon main pahunchataa he
 The intestinal bacterium converts bilirubin into urobilinogen
 yahan se eurobilinosen do maarg apana saktaa he
 It can either be then converted to stercobilinozene, which is then oxidized to stercobilin and released into the stool or it can be reabsorbed by intestinal cells, transported into the kidneys into the blood
 And the oxidized product is released into the urine in the form of urobilin
 stercobilin or eurobilin utpaada kramshah mel or mutr ke rang ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 When a pathological process interferes with the normal function of metabolism and excretion of bilirubin is reported correctly, it can result in jaundice
 rogaatmak kriya dwaara prabhavit hone vaale shaareerik tantra ke angon ke aadhaar par pilia ko teen shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he
 There are three categories: yakrut main pehle hone vaala pilia kisi bhi aise kaaran se hota he jo rakt-apghaton ke dar main vruddhi karata he
 In tropical countries, malaria can cause jaundice in this manner
 kuch anuvanshik bimaariyaan jaise ki hansiya ke aakaar kii rakt koshika main hone vaali raktaheenata, golckoshikta or glucose 6-phosphate dihydrogenej kii kami koshika apghaton main vruddhi utpann kar sakati he or isliye rudhirlayi pilia ho saktaa he
 Typically, kidney diseases, such as hemolytic uremiogenic syndrome, can also lead to pigmentation
 billirubin ke chayapachay main vikaar hone se bhi pilia ho saktaa he
 Jaundice usually comes with high temperature fever
 chuuhe ke kaatane se hone vaale bukhaar se bhi pilia ho saktaa he
 Laboratory findings include: yakrut main hone vaala pilia gambhir yakritshoth, yakrut kii vishaaktata or alcohol sambandhi yakrut rog kaa kaaran banataa he, jiske dwaara koshika parigalan yakrut ke chayapachay karne kii kshamta or rakt kaa nirmaan karne ke liye billirubin utsarjit karne kii kshamta kam karata he
 Less common causes include primary gall bladder disease, Gilbert's syndrome, kriegler-najjar syndrome, metastatic cancer, and nyman-pick's disease, class C
 Jaundice found in a newborn baby, called neonatal jaundice, usually usually each Occurs in the newborn because hepatic mechanisms for the coincidence and excretion of bilirubin are not fully mature before about two weeks of age It happens
 prayogshaala ke nishkarshon main shaamil hai: Out-of-liver jaundice, also known as obstructive jaundice, is caused by obstructions in bile clearance in the biliary system
 sabase aam kaaran hai aam pitt nalee main pitt pathari kaa hona or agnyashay ke sheersh par agnashyi cancer hona
 iske alaava, parjiviyon kaa ek samooh, jinhen "yakrut paraseete" kaha jaataa he aam pitt nalee main rah sakate hai, jo pratirodhatmak pilia utpann kar sakate hai
 Other causes include blockage of the common bile duct, biliary atresia, ductal carcinoma, pancreatitis, and pancreatic larynx
 pratirodhatmak pilia kaa ek asaadhaaran kaaran mirizzi sanglakshan he
 The presence of yellow stools and dark urine indicates a resistant or out-of-liver cause as normal stools receive color from bile pigment
 rogiyon main kabhi-kabhi atyadhik serum cholestrol upasthit rah saktaa he or ve aksar gambhir khujali yaa "khaaj" kii shikaayat karte hai
 No one can distinguish between different classifications of investigational jaundice
 yakrut ke kaary pareekshanon kaa mishran ek nidaan par pahunchane ke liye aavashyak he
 Neonatal jaundice is usually harmless: this condition is often seen in newborns, about the second day after birth
 yah avasthaa saamaanya prasavon main 8wein din tak rahati he, yaa samay se pehle janm hone par 14wein din tak rahati he
 Serum bilirubin goes to low levels without any necessary intervention: jaundice is likely the result of a metabolic and physiological adaptation after birth
 charam sthitiyon main, mastishk ko nuksaan pahunchane vaali sthiti mastiskinvjatkaamala utpann ho sakati he, jisase mahatvapurn aaajeevan aapangata ho sakati he
 There is concern that the condition has been increasing in recent years due to insufficient discovery and inadequate treatment of neonatal bilirubin overdose
 aarambhik upachaar main aksar shishu ko gahan prakaashachikitsa ke sansarg main laayaa jaataa he
 It was once believed that people suffering from jaundice saw everything yellow
 vistaar main jane par, piliagrast aankh kaa arth ek pakshpatpurna drushtikon samajha jane laga, jo saamaanya rup se adhik nakaaratmak yaa adhik doshagrahi tha
 Alexander Pope wrote in "an Essay on Criticism": "the infected detective seems to be infected by everyone, as the partisan view seems to be biased everywhere"
 Similarly in the mid-19th century the English poet Lord Alfred Tennyson wrote in his poem Locksley Hall: "so i triumphe'd ere my passion sweeping thro 'me left me dry, left me with the palsied heart, and left me with a jaundiced eye
 " piliagrast adhikansh rogiyon main yakrut falak asaamanyataon kii vibhinn purvanumaan yogya paddatiyaan hongi, yadhyapi isamen avashya hi mahatvapurn parivartan hota he
 Typical liver plaques will primarily include blood levels of liver-derived enzymes, such as aminotransferase and alkaline lupus; Bilirubin; And protein levels, specifically, total protein and volume
 Other major laboratory tests for liver function include GGT and prothrombin time
 haddi or hriday sambandhi kuch vikaar ALP or eminotransferez main vruddhi laa sakate hai
 Therefore, the first step towards differentiating them from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which will only increase in specific liver conditions
 The second step is to differentiate from biliary or hepatic causes of jaundice and altered laboratory tests
 pehla vishesh rup se ek shalya chikitsa sambandhi pratikriya suchit karata he, jabaki doosraa vishesh rup se chikitsiya pariksha kii pratikriya kaa sahaara letaa he
 ALP and GGT levels in particular will increase in one way while AST and ALT will increase in a different way
 If ALP and GGT levels rise in proportion to the height of AST and ALT, then this indicates the problem of gallbladder disease
 duusari taraf, agar AST or ALT main vruddhi ALP or GGT main vruddhi se mahatvapurn rup se adhik hota he, to yah ek yakrut sambandhi samasya ko suchit karata he
 Finally, comparing the levels of AST and ALT may be useful in distinguishing between hepatic causes of jaundice

 Criticism or critique is the literary mode of discussing an object / subject, keeping its goal in view, its merits and demerits and suitability
 hindi aalochana kii shuruyaat 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main bharatendu yug se hi maani jaati he
 'criticism' literally means 'to look well'
 'aalochana' shabd 'luch' dhaatu se bana he
 'luch' means 'to see'
 samiksha or samalochna shabdon kaa bhi yahi arth he
 'criticism' is treated as a synonym for the term 'criticism' in English
 sanskrit main prachlit 'tikaa-vyakhya' or 'kavy-siddhantanirupan' ke liye bhi aalochana shabd kaa prayog kar liya jaataa he kintu acharya ramachandra shukla kaa spasht mat he ki aadhunik aalochana, sanskrit ke kavy-siddhantanirupan se swatantra chiz he
 The task of criticism is to examine a literary work thoroughly and determine its form, population and economy
 doctor shyamsundar das ne aalochana kii paribhaasha in shabdon main di he: That is, the duty of criticism is a literary interpretation of a literary work
 sahityakar jivan or anbhuv ke jin tatwon ke sanshleshan se sahitya rachana karata he, aalochana unheen tatwon kaa vishleshan karti he
 Where literature is dominant in literature, there is an element of wisdom in criticism
 aalochana aitihaasik, saamaajik, raajnneetik paristhitiyon or shistayon kaa bhi akalan karti he or sahitya par unke padane vaale prabhaavon kii vivechna karti he
 Condemning or criticizing a work based on personal interest is not a religion of criticism
 kriti kii vyakhya or vishleshan ke liye aalochana main paddati or pranali kaa mahatva hota he
 While criticizing, the critic can avoid his personal rage, disinterest, disinterest, only when he follows the method, he can only do justice to literature by being objective
 is drushti se hindi main acharya ramachandra shukla ko sarvshereshth aalochak mana jaataa he
 The types of criticism develop according to the beliefs and practices that are accepted when criticizing
 saamanyat: samiksha ke chaar prakaaron ko sweekaar kiya gaya he:- Theories of literature are considered in theoretical criticism
 isamen pracheen shastreey kaavyagon - ras, alankaar aadi or sahitya kii aadhunik manyataon tathaa niyamon kii mukhya rup se vivchena kii jaati he
 In theoretical criticism the point of consideration is whether the criterion of literature is classical or historical
 maandand kaa shastreey rup, sthir or aparivartansheel hota he kintu mandandon ko aitihaasik shrenee maananaper unka swaroop parivartansheel or vikasaatmak hota he
 Both types of theoretical criticisms are available
 kintu ab usee saiddhanthik aalochana kaa mahatva adhik he jo sahitya ke tatwon or niyamon kii aitihaasik prakriya main vikasman maanati he
 When literature is decided on the basis of certain principles, it is called judgmental criticism
 ise ek prakaar kii naitik aalochana bhi mana jaataa he
 Its main nature is to pass judgment on literary works like a judge
 aisi aalochana praaia: hi siddhanth kaa yantric dhang se upyog karti he
 Therefore, the importance of decisive criticism decreases
 yadhyapi mulya yaa shreshth sahitya or nikrusht sahitya kaa bodh paidaa karnaa aalochana ke pradhan dharmon main se ek he lekin vah siddhanton ke yantric upyog se nahin sabhanv he
 In the 'hindi Sahitya Kosh', the subject of decisive criticism is told: is prakaar aalochana main nirnay vivaad kaa bindu utana nahin he jitna nirnay ke liye apanaaya gaya tarika
 Like, there is value judgment in Ramchandra Shukla's criticism, but his method is creative, not mechanical
 nirnayaatmak aalochana main mulya or tarika, donon kii main lacheelaapan nahin hota
 In this critique, the effect of poetry on critic Cayman makes him busy with the stylish designation
 isamen vayactik ruchi hi mukhya he
 Effective Criticism is not an object of shock
 na gyaan ke kshetra main uskaa mulya he na bhav ke kshetra main
