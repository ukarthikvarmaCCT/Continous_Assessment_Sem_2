 mcdonald Gravity is the tendency of a material to be attracted towards one another
 gurutvkarshan ke bare main pehali baar koi ganitiya sutara dene kii koshish ijak newton dwaara kii gayi jo ascharyajanak rup se sahi tha
 He proposed the theory of gravity
 newton ke siddhanth ko baad main albert oinstin dwaara saapekshata siddhant se badla gaya
 Earlier Varah Mihir had said that only some kind of power keeps things sticking to the earth
 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects
 apane is nishkarsh kii pushti usne prayogon or ganitiya vivechanon dwaara kii he
 German astronomer Kepler gave three laws by studying the motion of planets
 kepler kaa pratham niyam: -sabhi grah surya ke chaaron ore dirghavrittakar kakshaon me chakkar lagate hai tathaa surya un kakshaon ke focus par hota he
 Second law - The line joining any planet to the Sun crosses the same area at the same time
 arthath prayek grah kii kshetreey chaal niyat rahati he
 That is, when the planet is away from the Sun, its speed decreases
 tritiy niyam : - prayek grah kaa surya kaa parikraman kaal kaa varg uski deergh vrittakar kaksha kii ardh-deergh aksh kii tritiy ghaat ke samaanupati hota he
 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
 Earth attracts heavy substances with its attraction power and due to attraction they fall to the ground
 par jab akaash main samaan takat chaaron ore se lage, to koi kaise gire? arthath akaash main grah niravlamb rahete hai kyonki vividh grahon kii gurutv shaktiyaan santulan banaae rakhti hai

 Amroha AMROHA) Explosives are some compounds or mixtures in which they erupt with a big bang when set on fire or strike
 dhamaake kaa kaaran bade alp kaal main bahut badi maatra main gaison kaa bananaa hota he
 Such substances are called "explosives"
 aaj bahut badi maatra main visphotakon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Explosives have two purposes: shaantikaal main unase chattaanon ko udaaya or koyale or anya khanijon ko kam kharch main khaanon se nikaala jaataa he tathaa During the war, enemies are protected from harm by explosions
 jis teen mile lambii surang ke banane main teen hajaar vyakti 11 varshon tak kaam main lage the, vahi surang aadhunik mashiinon or visphotakon kii sahaayta se keval 100 vyaktiyon dwaara das maas main ban sakati he
 Explosives are a mixture of chemical substances, which are detonated due to the formation of a large amount of gas with the hammer being hit or touched by a flame, or the sudden heat produced by electrically blasting
 yadi kisi band kaksh main visphoton ho, to kaksh kii deevaaren chhin bhinn ho jaati he
 But beneficial explosives are essentially inert, so that their manufacture and transport are safe
 kuch visphotak aise hote hai ki pankh se chune par bhi ve visphutit ho jate hai
 Such explosives are of no useful use
 upyogi visphotakon main kuch ucch visphotak hote hai or kuch saamaanya yaa mand visphotak
 This distinction is not made on the basis of their sensitivity, but on their ability to differentiate
 kuch visphotak, jaise mercury falminute tathaa lead azid, jo bade sugrahi hote hai, praathmik visphotak ke rup main nune sugrahi visphotak ke visphoton main upyukt hote hai
 Some of the major explosives are: 1
 dynamite -- teevr visphotak, shaantikaal ke liye 2
 Explosive Gelatin - For intense explosive, peacetime 3
 tianti -- teevr visphotak, yuddh ke liye 4
 Picric acid - for intense explosive warfare 5
 ammonium nitrate -- teevr visphotak yuddh ke liye 6
 Smokeless powder - Dim explosive, for war 7
 kalachurna yaa barood -- mand visphotak, shanti or yuddh donon ke liye 8
 Mercury Falminet --- Auxiliary explosive, for warfare 9
 lead azid --- sahaayak visphotak, yuddh ke liye Nitroglycerin is used in the manufacture of dynamite
 nitroglisreen aavashyaktaa se adhik sugrahi hota he
 Keyslagar is used to reduce its sensitivity
 america main kizalgar ke sthaan main kaath chura, yaa kaath samita or sodium nitrate kaa upyog hota he
 The amount of nitroglycerin in dynamite is 20, 40, or 60 75 per cent
 isaki prabalata nitroglisreen kii maatra par nirbhar karti he
 Dynamite with 75 percent nitroglycerin is predominant
 kizalgar, yaa kashthachurna, yaa samita ke prayog kaa uddeshy dynamite kaa sangrakshan hota he, taaki yatayaat main vah visphutit na ho jaae
 Nitroglycerin 13 ° c But freezes jam jane par yah visphutit nahin hota
 Therefore, to avoid it becoming useless in frosty climate, 20 parts glycerin dinitromonoclo-rhhydrin is added to it
 yah jamaavarodhikarak kaa kaam karata he
 This allows nitroglycerin-30 ° C
 Till the fluid remains
 nitroglisreen ke sthaan main nitroglykol kaa upyog ab hone laga he
 Explosive gelatin contains 90 percent glycerin and 10 percent nitrocellulose
 tii en tii trinitrotolvin he
 It is 81 degrees Celsius But melts
 di en tii ke saath ammonium nitrate ke mili rahane se tii en tii adhik prabal visphotak ho jaataa he
 Picric acid is explosive
 phenol ke nitretikaran se yah banataa he
 It is a yellow solid, 121 ° C
 But melts
 iskaa sis lavan picrik amla se 5 guna adhik sugrahi hota he
 The picric acid itself is filled in the shell
 ammonium nitrate tii en tii ke saath milakar prayukt hota he
 It also acts as an oxidizer
 swayan yah kathinata se prasphotin hota he
 Nitrocellulose is present in smokeless powder
 yah asitone se geletinikrut kiya rahata he
 Small amounts of diphenylamine and urea are used as stabilizers
 visphotakon kii kshamta do baton, prasphot kii tivrata or prasphot ke sanchaaran ke veg par nirbhar karti he
 The ability to discolor is based on both of these properties
 tivrata gaison or ooshmaa ke unmukt hone par nirbhar karti he
 For this, a known load of explosive is detonated by placing it in the cavity of the siphon
 isse sis nipind kii guha kaa uttanan ho jaataa he
 The volume of a cavity is a measure of the intensity of an explosive
 ek duusari vidhi main 500 pound morter ko lolak ke rup main latakaate he or usase 36 pound kaa gola chhodte hai
 This causes the mortar to rebound
 morter kaa yahi pratikshep prabalata kii maap he
 Both methods often yield only one result
 kathor chattaanon ko udaane ke liye prabal or ucch vegavaale visphotakon kii aavashyaktaa padati he or kam kathor chattaanon ke liye kam prabal or mand veg vaale visphotakon se kaam chal jaataa he
 One feature of the importance of explosives is its sensitivity
 sugrahita kaa pareekshan visphotak par bhaar giraakar kiya jaataa he
 The higher it falls from higher altitude, the less sensitive it is
 jo visphotak koyale kii khaanon main vyavahrut hote hai, unka pareekshan ek vishesh prakaar se hota he, kyoking koyale kii khaanon main jvalansheel gaisen rah sakati hai
 Explosives that do not erupt in such gases are used in mines
 aise visphotakon kii jwaala choti or alpakaalik hoti he
 The length and duration of the flame are measured by photography
 barood kii samyavadhi 0
077 second or jwaala kii lambaai 110 mimi
 tathaa gancoton kii samyavadhi 0
0013 second or jwaala kii lambaai 97 mimi
 hoti he
 The duration and flame length of picric acid ammonium nitrate are much shorter than this
 gancoton kii topakaksh main visphutit karne se prati varg inch lagbhag 3 ton kaa dabaav utpann hota he
 There are two types of explosives used in war: pranodak, jo kaartuson main bhare jate hai, tathaa Those which are filled in a round shell
 rifl ke kaartoos main bhi ek pranodak or duusari bullate yaa goli ja yashad-tamra mishradhatu kii bani hoti he, sis ke nichol main rakhi hoti he
 Tankmar rifles have steel bullets
 hathgole main koi pranodak nahin hota
 Nitrocellulose in the form of fiber is highly explosive, but after being gelatinized becomes dim explosive
 akele yaa anya padaarthon ke saath milakar, yahi pradhanthya mand visphotak ke rup main vyavahrut hoti he
 The pill shell contains TNT, or ametol, picric acid, or its salts
 iskaa kaam hota he nidisht sthaan par pahunchakar, tivrgami tukdon main chur chur ho janaa or vaastavik missile yaa astr ban janaa
 The shell holds a ball tied to rosin or ammo
 aise khol ko "shrepnel shell" kehete hai
 Battle gas may also remain in place of the ball
 khol ko palite dwaara jalaayaa jaataa he
 The shell is made of steel
 bahudhaa usamen aluminium kii naaknuma dhar lagi rahati he
 Nitrogen is 12
8 percent of the nitrocellulose used in explosives
 rakhane par dhoomahin churna kaa hraas hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to keep testing it periodically
 cordit main nitrocelulose or nitroglisreen donon rahete hai
 Their relative quantity is not fixed
 ek cordit main nitrocelulose 65 bhaag, nitroglisreen 30 bhaag or khanij jelly 0
5 bhaag rahete hai
 a second chordite contains nitrocellulose 37 parts, nitroglycerin 58 parts and jelly 0
5 parts
 asitone geletinikarak ke rup main prayukt hota he
 Potassium chlorate, potassium paralorate, nitrogenidine, mercury fulminate, lead azih, nitro starch, liquid oxygen, and wood coal are also used as explosives

 The Trojan horse or horse of the horse is a story in which the Greek soldiers built a huge wooden horse to enter the city of Tray and fraudulently entered the city of Tri
 virgil dwaara rachit latin mahakavy da anid or kuintus of smirna ke anusaar trogen horse trogen yuddh kii ek katha he
 The events in this tale are from the Bronze Age and were written before Homer's ODC and after the Elyad
 yah unaniyon kii chaal ke dwaara hi sambhav ho paaya kii ve antat troy shahar main pravesh kar sangharsh kaa ant kar paye
 ek prasiddh vivaran ke anusaar, 10 varsh kii vyarth gheraabandi ke pashchaat unaniyon ne ek vishaal lakdi ke ghode kaa nirmaan kiya or uske andar 30 sipaahion kii vishisht tukdi ko chupa diya
 The Greeks pretended to leave and the Trojans pulled the horse into the city as a reward for their victory
 usee raat unani sena kii tukdi ghode se baahar nikal aayi or baaki unani sena ke liye dwaar khol diye, jo andhere kii chadar main waapas aa gayi thi
 The Greek army entered the city of Troy and destroyed it, winning the war and ending it
 unani parampara ke anusaar, homeric ionic bhashaa main ghode ko kaath kaa ghoda tathaa "gift horse" kaha jaataa he
 Symbolically, any such move was called a "trojan horse" by inviting the enemy to a safe place and targeting it
 in dinon ise praayah "virus yukt" computer kaaryakramon se bhi joda jaataa he or upabhoktaaon ko upyogi athwa hanirahit bataakar sthapit karne or chalaane ke liye prerit kiya jaataa he
 According to Kuintus Smirnas, Odysseus conceived the idea of building a huge wooden horse, hiding a specific army troop inside it, and fooling the Trojans and rolling the horse on wheels as a symbol of their victory
 
 ipeos ke netritv main, unaniyon ne teen din main lakdi ke ghode kaa nirmaan kiya
 According to Odysseus' plan a man was to live outside the horse; Which the Greeks were supposed to pretend to leave the horse as a gift for the Trojans and leave it behind
 keval ek unani sipaahi sinon ne hi is bhoomika ke liye swayamsevak bananaa sweekaar kiya
 Virgil describes the actual encounter between Sinon and the Trojans: Sinon successfully convinces the Trojans that the Greeks have left him behind
 sinon trogence ko bataata he ki vah ghoda unaniyon dwaara devi athena ko unke troy ke mandir ko apavitra karne ke paap kii kshatipurti karne ke liye or unki ghar ke liye surakshit yatra ko sunishchit karne ke liye ek bhent he
 The reason for making the horse so large was to prevent the Trojans from transporting it to their city and to collect Athena's hermitage for themselves
 sinon se poochtacha ke samay, trogen pujari laokun ko sajeesh kaa anumaan ho jaataa he or ve trogence ko chetavanee dete hai, virgil dwaara likhi gayi ye panktiyaan prasiddh hai "timeo Danos et dona ferentes" 
 isse pehle ki kisi trogen ko uski chetavanee par yakeen aata, bhagwaan posidon ne do samudri naagon ko uskaa or uske putron antifntes or thimbreys kaa galaa ghotane ke liye bhej diya
 Kasandra, the prophet of Troy and daughter of King Priam, also said that the horse would collapse the city and the royal family
 uski bhi upeksha kii gayi jiske kaaran unka vinaash or ve yuddh haar gaye
 This incident is mentioned in the Odyssey: !' 4
271 ff The most elaborate and most well-known version is Enid, written by Virgil, in Book 2
 pustak II main laokun kaa kathan "equo ne credite, Teucri shaamil he
 Quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et ferentes
 The modern saying, "one should be careful with the gifts brought by the Greeks" originated from here only
 tees sainik trogen horse ke pet main or do jasoos uske munh main chhip gayi
 Other sources have given different numbers; Apollodorus 50; Zetzes 23; And Kuintus Smyrness has given thirty names but it is also said that there were more soldiers there
 baad main yah sankhya 40 par manakikrut kar di gayi
 Their names are as follows: homer ke anusaar, troy pani kii ek nahar, hellyspont, jo asia minore or europe ko alag karti he, ke upree kinare par sthit he
 In the 1870s, Heinrich Schleiman discovered it
 homer dwaara diye gayi vivaran ke anusaar usne turki main hisarlik main khudaai shuru kii or ek ke upar ek nirmit kai shaharon ke khandhiron ko dhundh nikaala
 anek shahar hinsaatmak dhang se nasht kar diye gayi the, lekin yah spasht nahin he ki homer kaa troy koun sa tha
 The Pusanians, who lived two hundred years after Christ, wrote in their account of Greece, "the work of Epius was to make a crack in the wall of the Trojan by a device, it is known to all that the reason for the foolishness of the Phrygians
 Do not believe "frigians here mean Trojans
 aadhunik kalpana ke anusaar trogen horse, kuch had tak ghode jaisaa dikhne vaala ek diwaar todane vaala takhta hoga or uske upyog kaa vivaran puranic katha ke anusaar un maukhik itihaaskaaron dwaara badal diya gaya jo yuddh main maujuud nahin the or uske naam ke matlab se anjaan the
 At that time the Assyrians used animal names for siege organizations; So it is possible that the Trojan horse should be something like this
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki vastav main trogen horse kisi bukamp kaa ek rup ho jo ladaaiyon ke bich aayaa ho, jisane troy kii deevaaron ko kamazor kar unhen akraman ke liye khulaa chhod diya ho; devtaa posidon ne samudr, ghodon or bhukampon ke ishwar ke rup main tripaksheeya kaary kiya
 Structural damage on Troy VI - its location is similar to that shown in Homer's Elyad, and the artifacts found also indicate that it was a place of extraordinary trade and power - indicating that there must have been an earthquake indeed
 aam taur par troy viia ko homer kaa troy mana jaataa he
 There may also be a hint towards the Trojan cavalry of the Trojan horse Hector
 ho saktaa he ki dushman ne khud ko is ashwarohi sena tukdi ke rup main chipaaya ho or uski aadh main bina kisi poochtacha ke troy main le jaye gayi hon
 trogen horse kii is vyakhya kaa troy ke naataktray ke tisare bhaag main lekhak david yemel dwaara prayog kiya gaya he
 There is only one surviving classical depiction of the Trojan horse, a carving of the Maykonos pot
 yah aathvi shatabdi isa purv purana he, yuddh ke anumaanit samay se lagbhag 500 varsh pashchaat lekin paramparaagat taur par homer dwaara likhit vivaran se purv kaa he

 kuch praani, jo kuch dur tak chal sakate hai or tivrgami hai, jalwaayu parivartan ke kaaran apana nivas kshetra badal dete hai, jaise jab europe main dakshin kii ore himandakalp kaa prasar hua, tab bahut se uttari stani isaki lapet main aa gaye
 Hence the remains of lemmings and arctic foxes are found far to the south
 jab mridu jalwaayu prarambh hui or himkhand pighalane laga, tab arctic praroop ke vanshaj, jaise rangifer or shwet lomadiyaan, uttar kii ore chali gayi
 Changes in the climate of a country bring about significant changes in the nature of animals and also play an important part in determining the life cycle of an organism
 jalwaayu parivartan ke kaaran praani kii upapachayee kriya kii gati mand yaa teevr ho sakati he, athwa jivan kii kisi vishesh avasthaa main parivartan ho saktaa he
 Amongst breastmilk, at least there may be differences in the endocrine gland or the secretory activity of the glands
 stani main garbhakaal evam prasav kii ritu, pakshiyon main deshaantaran kii aavartita, sheetanishkriyata, vishram, sheetatandra, susti ityadi kaa kaaran jalwaayu parivartan ho saktaa he
 Due to the increase in humidity, juicy plants are produced, and consequently there is growth of the grazing animals, as the forest expands, the animals get shelter
 adrrata kii thodi kami se ghaas main vruddhi hoti he or uske kaaran ghaas charanevaale jaanwaron main vruddhi hoti he
 The aridity causes a narrowing of the forest boundary and thus the creature is motivated to search for new shelter
 jab kisi bahumoolya vanaspati yaa jaanavar kaa bilkul nae or bhinn prakaar kii jalwaayu vaale desh main deshikaran ke liye aayaat karnaa ho, tab ayatakarta ko chahie ki vah pashu yaa vanaspati kii kisi aisi kism ko chune jo us jalwaayu ke anukool prathit ho
 Variation of quality should also be noted, because some parent, or animal lineage, is more conservative than others
 honhaar muulavrunt yaa pashu kaa kisi madhyamik sthaan main aayaat karnaa upyogi hoga
 Darwin observed that the sheep of the Cape of Goodhope breed in India grew well in India, compared to the sheep raised in England
 un avasthaaon main jahaan nae desh main pashu yaa vanaspati kii vruddhi main safalataa kisi vishesh gun, jaise mote fer yaa roendaar pattiyon par nirbhar karti he, unka varan aise parivart main kiya jaae jinamein vaanchit disha main bhinnata kii pravriti bhalee bhanti jaan pade
 Willis observed that man has failed to naturalize due to very inconsistent efforts
 asafalataaon se shiksha lekar manushya kramik parivartan kaa prayaas kar rahaa he, jaisaa usne liberia kii coffee ko java main ugane main kiya he
 By taking seeds of each successive generation of coffee, each time sown at the height of a few more yards, the natural state has been made able to grow well at a much higher height than the seed was
 lanka ke vanaspatik upavan main europe se laayaa gaya sundar cypiras payaras ke beej ko ugane kaa prayaas nishphal ho gaya, kintu bharat ke saharanpur se laae gaye beej ke ugane kaa prayaas safal ho gaya
 The conclusion is that man should not be too hasty and should gradually learn to naturalize in the long term, taking lessons from natural processes

 The story goes that Gideon Manten's wife, Mary Ann, discovered the first tooth in 1822 in Cuckfield Whitemans Green, Sussex, England, in the level of Tilgate Forest, while her husband visited a patient of a large type of herbaceous or vegetative plant
 Bhoji Gecko, which is now found only in poured form
 haalanki, vahaan koi saboot nahin he ki monten uske saath uski patni ko le liya, jabaki rogiyon dekh he
 In addition, in 1851 he admitted that he had found himself having teeth

 1821 main monten shaakaahaari daant kii khoj ke liye ullekh kiya he or sambhaavna he ki ek bade shaakaahaari saanp ke str main maujuud tha par vichaar shuru kar diya
 However, in his 1822 publication Fossil of the South Downs, he did not yet dare to suggest a connection between the teeth and his very unfinished skeleton, assuming that his finds are two large forms, one carnivorous, the other herbivorous
 In May 1822, he first presented to the Geological Society of London the vegetarian teeth but members, among which William Buckland, dismissed them as incisors of fish teeth or a rhinoceros from a tertiary layer
 23 June 1823 Charles Lyell George Cuvier discovered something, during a banquet in Paris, but the famous French naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros
 haalanki kuwiyar agle hi din se mukar gaya, liel keval monten, jo is mudde ke bare main nahin balki shankashil ban gaya barkhaastagi kii soochna di
 In 1824 Buckland described the megalosaurus and that the Manten Collection was an invited occasion for travel
 6 march ko haddiyon ko dekhakar vah is baat par sahamat hue ki in kuch vishaal rengne vaale jaanavar the, haalanki abhi bhi yah is baat kaa khandan karte ek herbivore tha
 Still emboldened, Manten then sent some teeth to Cuvier, who replied on 22 June 1824 that he had determined that they were snakes and quite possibly are a giant herbivore
 In a new version of his Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles Cuvier that this year led to an immediate acceptance of Mantane by accepting his earlier mistake and finding a parallel modern day between the new lizard, Manten's current reptile in its scientific circles Tried further confirmation of his theory by +1,824 In September he visited the Royal College of Surgeons, but was unable to find a comparable tooth at first

 However, assistant curator Samuel Stutchbury recognized that they had an ocher he had recently prepared to resemble those now twenty times, though
