 phir to yah ek maanak ban gaya
 The statue of Buddha in a central hall in this sacred place was often seated in the dharma-chakra-pramana posture
 jin gufaaon main naveenatam visheshtaayen hai, vahaan kinare kii deevaaron, dwaar mandapon par or praangan main gaun pavitra sthal bhi bane dikhte hai
 The walls of many viharas are decorated with carvings

 With the difference in Buddhist thought in the first century, Buddha was given the status of a deity and worshiped him

 In the past, academics divided the caves into three groups, but were rejected due to evidence and research

 The expression cave temple used by the anglo-indians for the viharas was considered inappropriate

 Hiuen Tsang states that Dinnag, a famous Buddhist philosopher, philosopher who was the author of several texts on logic, lived here

 It is very sad that no cave of Vakataka stage is complete
 yah is kaaran hua ki shaasha vaakatak vansh ekaek shaktiviheen ho gaya, jisase uski praja bhi sankat main aa gayi
 Due to this, all activities were interrupted and stopped suddenly
 yah samay ajanta kaa antim kaal rahaa
 This is a first step and has no meaning in the sequence of other caves
 yah ashwanal aakaar kii dhaal par purvi ore se pratham gupha he
 According to Spink one of the last caves built at this site is towards the end of the Vakataka phase
 haalaanki koi shilalekhith sakshya upasthit nahin hai; phir bhi yah mana jaataa he ki vaakatak raja harisena is uttam sangrakshit gupha ke sangrakshak rahe hon
 The main reason for this is that Harisena was not initially involved in the protection of Ajanta, but could not stay away from them for a long time, because this site was full of activities during his reign and his Buddhist subjects were given this sacred work of that Hindu king
 Could be happy to shelter
 yahan darshit kai vishay rajsik hai
 This cave has very elaborate carving work, which also has many highly embossed crafts

 Its level was relatively high
 iske dwaar mandap ke donon ore kothiyaan hai
 The absence of the pillared cells at the end suggests that this pavilion was not built with the last phase of Ajanta, when the pillared cells had become a regular part

 There are three gateways here, one central and two sideways

 a gargantuan image is carved on the back wall, in which the Buddha is shown seated in his dharma-chakra-vimana posture

 These walls are full of paintings, which are in a perfect state of preservation

 It looks very beautiful and looks almost similar to the cave number, but is in a far better state of conservation
 is gupha main do dwaar-mandap hai, jo ki sankhya 1 se bahut alag he
 Rather, the carving of the panels also looks different from that
 is gupha ko sahaara diye do achche khaase mote stambh hai, jo ki baari nakkashi se alankrita hai
 Yes, it definitely resembles the first cave in size, shape and land plan

 vartmaan paris main, dyna prince ko wain enterprijej dwaara bheji gayi ek photographic plate milti he, jisame vah pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan chaar logon ke saath khadi hoti he
 Seeing this picture, she is lost in the memories of her past
 rani hippolita kii beti, dyna kaa bachapan ek chhipe hue dweep, themiskira par beetaa tha, jo zyoos dwaara nirmit maanav jati kii rakshak yoddha mahilaon kaa ghar tha
 Hippolyta told Diana once in childhood the history of the Amazon, how Zeus' son, Eris, became jealous of humanity and devised plans to destroy it
 jab anya devataaon ne use rokane kaa prayaas kiya, to aries ne ek yuddh main zyoos ko chhodkar anya sabhi devataaon ko maar daalaa; or phir ghayal zyoos ne apni bachi hui aakhri shakti kaa prayog kar aries ko waapas jane par majaboor kar diya, or is prakriya main vah veergati ko praapt ho gaye
 Before his death, Zeus built the island of Amazon to confront Eris's return in the future, and organized an army of women to provide him with a weapon called Godkiller
 yadhyapi hippolita prarambh main dyna ko astravidya or yudhniti main prashikshit karne ke viruddh thi, parantu dyna kii zid or uski bahan, antip ke samajhane par usne anichhaa main antip ko dyna ko prashikshan dene kii anumati de di
 In 1917, Diana, now a young man, rescued American pilot Captain Steve Trevor, whose plane crashed off the Themyskira coast
 dweep par jaldi hi ek german lite kruger ne akraman kar diya, jo trevor kaa peechha karata hua vahaan aa dhamka tha
 The Amazon warriors defeated and defeated the ship, but Antip sacrificed his life to save him from a bullet coming towards Diana
 amejan ke logon ne hestia ke laso kii sahaayta se steve se poochtacha kii, jisase unhen pataa chalaa ki bahari duniya main ek mahaan yuddh chhidaa hua he, or trevor vastav main ek america jasoos he
 He has stolen a notebook from the chief chemist Isabel Maru to Germany, who was attempting to manufacture an weapon called Mustard Gas in the Ottoman Empire under the command of General Erich Ludendorff
 aris ko is yuddh ke liye zimmedaar maanakar dyna "godkiller" talwaar, ek laso or apana kavach pahanakar steve ke saath themiskira chhodkar bahari duniya main chali jaati he
 Arriving in London, he delivered Maru's notebook to the Supreme War Council, where Sir Patrick Morgan was trying to negotiate a ceasefire with Germany
 dyna maaru ke noton kaa anuwaad karti he or bataati he ki german pashchimi morche par ek ghaatak gas chhodane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Despite being refused by his commander, Steve, along with a secret fund from Sir Patrick, recruits Detective Sameer, Shooter Charlie, and Smuggler Chief, to prevent the Germans from releasing the gas
 unki team belgium main yudhakshetra par pahunchati he
 Upon arriving there, Diana sneaks into No Man's Land alone and destroys enemy targets, allowing Allied forces to free Weld Village from enemies
 is vijay par team ek chota sa jashn manaati he, jabaki dyna or steve ek duusare ke or kareeb aa jate hai
 The team learns that a celebration will be held at the nearby German High Command
 steve or dyna alag-alag hokar usamen ghuspaith karte hai, steve kaa iraadaa gas kaa pataa lagane or ise nasht karne kaa tha, jabaki dyna ludendorf ko maarane ke liye vahaan gayi thi, jise vah aries maan rahi thi, or use maar dene se yuddh samaapt ho jayega
 Steve stops him from spoiling his mission, but Ludendorff gets the chance, and he leaves the gas on the weld, killing all the inhabitants there
 is haadase ke liye steve ko doshi tehraate hue, dyna ludendorf ko us sthaan par le jaati he, jahaan gas ko landan le jaae jane ke liye sthit ek bombar vimaan main lod kiya ja rahaa hota he
 Diana battles Ludendorff and kills her, but her death has no effect on the war, leaving her confused
 tabhi, sar patric vahaan aate he or dyna ko bataate hai ki vah hi vastav main aries hai
 Eris tells Diana that although she has interfered with humans' thoughts and motivations from time to time using pawns such as Ludendorff and Maru, humans ultimately decide to resort to violence, as they are inherently corrupt
 jab dyna "godciller" talwaar se aries ko maarane kaa prayaas karti he, to vah ise nasht kar detaa he, or phir khulaasa karata he ki "godciller" koi astr nahin, balki dyna swayan he, jo vastav main zyoos or hippolita kii putree he
 Eris requests Diana to help destroy mankind in order to make the Earth resemble heaven, which she rejects
 duusari ore, un donon kii ladaai ke dauraan, steve kii team maaru kii prayogshaala ko nasht kar detii he
 Steve hijacks a gas-filled bomber aircraft, and explodes to a safe altitude, destroying all the gas
 is prakriya main steve kii bhi mrityu ho jaati he, jisase dyna krodhit tathaa dukhi ho jaati he
 Taking advantage of this, Aerys attempts to provoke Diana to kill Maru by claiming that Maru is responsible for Steve's death, but based on her experiences with Steve, Diana arrives at the decision that there is still goodness within humans
 vah maaru ko chhod detii he, or aries kii hi bijli kaa prayog kar use maar detii he
 This ends the war, and the team celebrates the end of the war

 But after three years it was joined by John Cohen, who was making it for Joel Silver, and wanted to cast Sandra Bullock for the role of Wonder Woman
 2001 tak, tod alcot ko isaki patakatha likhane kaa kaam saunp diya gaya tha, or iskaa nirmaan silver pikchars ke binar tale hona tha
 At the time, actors such as Mariah Carey and Catherine zeta-jones were also rumored to be playing Wonder Woman
 haalanki, leonard goldberg ne bulak ko lene par jor diya, jinhone kaha ki unase is bhoomika ke liye sampark kiya gaya tha

 Over the following years, several writers, including Alcott, Cohen, Becky Johnston, and Phillip Levens, wrote several drafts for the film's screenplay, and by August 2003, screenwriter Layta Kalogridis had been replaced in place of Leavens
 march 2005 main warner bros or silver pikchars ne ghoshnaa kii ki jose wheaden is film ko likhenge or nirdeshit karenge, or unka vetan lagbhag $2 se $3 million ke madhya hoga
 Since Wheeden was directing the film Serenity at the time, and needed some time to learn about Wonder Woman's background, he did not begin work on the screenplay until the end of 2005
 apni patakatha ke shuruaati drafton main wheaden ne steve trevor ko kathavachak ke rup main shaamil kiya tha, jo dyna or uski maa ke bich ek bhayankar ladaai kaa kaaran banataa he, or dyna ke themiskira dweep chhodane ke baad aadhunik duniya main asahaay ho chuki dyna kaa baar baar bachaav karata he
 However, Whidden did not complete the final version of his screenplay, and then in 2007 he left the project
 yadhyapi wheaden ne may 2005 main kaha tha ki vah script samaapt hone tak vander vuman ke liye kisi abhinetri ko nahin chunenge, lekin ket bekincel kuch samay baad film se jud gayi thi
 However in 2010, Whidden admitted she had an actress in mind for the role, when she stated that "wonder Woman was originally Angelina Jolie
" " kuch saal baad may 2017 main, indi ground films ne wheaden kii patakatha ek sanskaran online li kar diya
 In June 2017, people reacted negatively to the script on social media, shortly after the release of the film's version of Patty Jenkins
 jab jenkins se june 2017 main ek saakshaatkaar main is patakatha ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki unhone ise nahin padhaa he or wheaden "ab disi univers main hai, or mujhe nahin lagata ki vahaan jane kii koi zarurat he yah jaisaa tha, vaisaa tha
 i am lucky that i got to do it
 lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki unhone jo kiya hota, yaa maine jo kiya, in donon kii tulana karne main koi phayda he

 Set during World War II, the script impressed Silver Pictures executives
 haalanki, silver ne kaha ki unhone patakatha isliye kharidi he, kyonki vah adhikaron ko waapas nahin lenaa chaahate the; jabaki script ko achche vichaar the, lekin silver vaale nahin chaahate the ki vander vuman ek period film ho
 By April 2008, Silver hired Jenison and Strickland to write a new script set set in contemporary times that would be about the history of Paradise Island, not based on the origins of Wonder Woman
 november 2008 main, gayika bionse ne disi comics or warner bros ke pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat kar vander vuman kii bhoomika nibhaane main ruchi vyakt kii

 Shortly thereafter, Paul Feig stated that he had given the studio the idea to make an action-comedy film for Wonder Woman
 studio ne bhi turant film nirdeshit karne ke liye mahila nirdeshkon kii khoj shuru kar di
 Michelle mclaren was the studio's initial choice, and she also initially showed interest in the project, but eventually left the project due to creative differences
 2015 main pati jenkins ke saamne vander vuman ko nirdeshit karne kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya, jise unhone sweekaar kar liya
 This time the film's screenplay was to be written by Alan Heinberg, based on a story co-written by Heinberg, Zac Snyder, Geoff Jones and Jason Fuchs
 vander vuman ke is sanskaran ke bare main, gadt ne kaha ki, For a long time, people could not understand what to approach the story
 jab pati or mere bich is charitra kii rachana ke bare main baatcheet hui, to hamen ehsaas hua ki dyna ek saamaanya bhi mahila ho sakati he, jiske adarsh ucch hai, lekin phir bhi, he vah ek mahila hi
