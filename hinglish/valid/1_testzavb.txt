 The word sandhi means 'mail'
 do nikatavarti varnon ke paraspar mail se jo vikaar hota he vah sandhi kehalaata he
 Like - Sama + Tosh = contentment; Dev + Indra = Devendra; Bhanu + Uday = Bhanuday
 sandhi teen prakaar kii hoti hai - The conjugation of two vowels is called vowel-joint
 jaise - vidya + aalay = vidhyalay
 There are five types of phonetics - sutara-ak: savarne deergh:arthath ak pratyaahaar ke baad uskaa savarna aaye to dono milakar deergh ban jate hai
 After Harsva or long A, E, U, if Harsva or long A, E, u come, then both become long A, e and O
 jaise - a / a + a / a = a i or i kii sandhi Treaty of u and OO isamen a, aa ke aage i, i ho to e ; u, uu ho to o tathaa ri ho to ar ho jaataa he
 This is called guna-sandhi
 jaise - a + e = A; Male + Indra = Narendra a + u = o ; gyaan + upadesh = gyanopadesh ; a + r = Ar Dev + Rishi = Devarshi aa + ri = ar maha + rishi = maharishi a becomes Aa when it matches A, a and a becomes a and o is o when they match O
 ise vruddhi sandhi kehete hai
 like - a + e = i ; ek + ek = ekaik ; a + o = Au One + Medicine = Vanaushadhi; Aa + o = Au Maha + Medicine = Mahoushadhi; i, i ke aage koi vijaateey swar hone par i i ko ‘y’ ho jaataa he
 U, UO becomes 'V' when a foreigner voice comes in front of U
 ‘ri’ ke aage kisi vijaateey swar ke aane par ri ko ‘r’ ho jaataa he
 These are called yana-sandhi
 i + a = y + a ; nadi + arpan = nadyarpan u + a = v + A; Experience e, i or o ou se pare kisi bhi swar ke hone par kramshah ay, aay, av or aav ho jaataa he
 This is called Ayadi Sandhi
 e + a = ay + a ; ne + an = nayan a + a = i + A; Gai + Ak = Singer o + a = av + a ; po + an = pawan Au + a = Av + A; Pau + aq = pavak ou + i = aav + i ; nau + ek = navik The change that occurs when the consonant matches the consonant or with a vowel is called consonant joint
 jaise-sharat + chandra = sharachchandra
 Brighter kisi varg ke pehle varna k, ch, t, t, p kaa mail kisi varg ke tisare athwa chauthe varna yaa y, r, l, v, ha yaa kisi swar se ho jaae to k ko g ch ko j, t ko d or p ko b ho jaataa he
 like - yadi kisi varg ke pehle varna kaa mail n yaa m varna se ho to uske sthaan par usee varg kaa paanchavaan varna ho jaataa he
 like - t kaa mail ga, gha, da, dha, ba, bha, ya, r, va yaa kisi swar se ho jaae to d ho jaataa he

 like - yadi m ke baad k se m tak koi vyanjan ho to m anuswaar main badal jaataa he
 like - m ke baad m kaa dvitv ho jaataa he
 like - m ke baad y, r, l, v, sh, sh, s, h main se koi vyanjan hone par m kaa anuswaar ho jaataa he
 like - ri, r, sh se pare n kaa n ho jaataa he
 But there is no question if class, class, category, power and s are interrupted
 jaise - If a vowel is different from a before A, the sound becomes silent
 jaise - The disorder that occurs in Visarga when the vowel or consonant comes after Visarga is called visarga-sandhi
 jaise- manah + anukool = manonukool If 'A' before 'visarga' and 'A' or 'third', fourth and fifth letters of classes, or Y, Su, L, and v before Visarga, it becomes o of Visarga
 jaise - Before Visarga, if there is a vowel except A, a and after it there is a vowel, third, fourth, fifth letter of the class or if any of Y, R, L, V, h becomes the word of Visarga
 jaise - If there is a vowel before the immersion and later if there is f, g or sh, then the sound of the immersion becomes
 jaise - After immersion, if there is root or c, then immersion becomes
 jaise - If there is any letter from A, B, T, TH, P, f before I, u and after Visarga, it becomes a word of Visarga
 jaise - If A, a comes before Visarga and after it is a different vowel, then Visarga is omitted
 jaise - There is no change in Visarga after A, b or P, f after immersion
 jaise - Chitiprolu Krishnamurthy is a noted Telugu litterateur

 Apart from his own work, he also collaborated with other scientists, including Bose Einstein statistics, Einstein refrigerator and many more
 
 Anus Mirabilis Papers is related to four articles that Einstein published in 1905 in a scientific journal called Onlen der Physik, which included photoelectric effects, Brownian motion, special relativism, and e = mc2
 in chaar lekhon ne aadhunik bhautikee kii neenv ke liye kaaphi yogadan diya he or antariksh, samay tathaa dravya par logo kii soch ko badla he

 This hypothesis was universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Mulliken's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and the Compton scattering measurements
 oinstin ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki aavriti kii prayek lahar, urja ke prayek photonon ke sangrah ke saath judaa hota he 
 He did not say more about this, because he was not sure how particles are related to waves
 lekin unhone suzav diya kii he,ki is pariklpana ko kuch prayogtmak parinaamon dwaara samajhaayaa ja saktaa hai jise hi baad main vishesh rup se prakashavidyut prabhaav kaha gaya
 In 1907, Einstein proposed a model that each atom oscillates independently in a lattice structure
 oinstin model main, prayek parmaanu swatantra rup se dolan karata he oinstin ko pataa tha ki vaastavik dolanon kii aavriti alag hoti hai lekin phir bhi is siddhant kaa prastaavit kiya, kyonki yah ek spasht pradarshan tha ki kaise kwantum yantriki, parmparik yantriki main vishisht garmi kii samasya ko hal kar saktaa hai
 Peter debai refined this model

 The Satrapas or Kshatrapas were said to be the governors of the provinces of the Meidi kingdom of ancient Iran and the Hakhamani kingdom
 is shabd kaa prayog baad main aane vaale saasaani or unani samrajyon ne bhi kiya
 In the modern era, a leader who works under a great power is sometimes informally called 'satrap'
 kisi satraap ke adheen kshetra ko satrapi kaha jaataa tha
 The word 'satrap' comes from the Avastai language and the word 'khatthrapavan' of the ancient Persian language
 is shabd main 'kshafur' sanskrit ke sajaateey shabd 'kshetra' se miltaa-julata he
 The word 'holy' means 'protector' in ancient Persian, which is derived both from the word 'follow' in Sanskrit and from the word 'holy'
 'kshabarapavan' samay ke saath parivartit ho gaya - 'kshafur' to 'shahar' ban gaya or 'paavan' 'baan' yaa keval 'pa' ban gaya
 From this, the word is found as 'satrap' and as 'shaharban', which in Sanskrit 'kshetrapal' would have been equal
 pracheen farsi main iske jaisi 'shoijerapaiti' oopaadhi bhi milti he, jiskaa sanskrit anuwaad 'kshetrapati' saral he or thik yahi oopaadhi chhatrapati shivaji ke liye prayog hoti he
 'kshatrap' is the name given to the provincial rulers by the Persian emperors in ancient times
 ibrani kaa 'shakhshadrapan' bhi isi arth main prayukt hua he
 It means 'protector of the state'

 According to Herodotus, the great of Kurush divided his empire into several provinces; Daryavosh organized them in a certain way and built 21 Kshatrap provinces throughout their empire and also fixed their tax
 kshatrapon tathaa upakshatrapon kaa sarvapratham kaary apane praanton kaa bhoomikar ikattha karnaa tha
 The Kshatrapa used to pay the residual portion to the Emperor by removing the royal army, judges and personal expenses from this tax
 yadi kshatrap samraat kaa kripapaatr bananaa chahta to vah samraat ke bhaag kii maatra adhik kar detaa
 There was no fixed amount of money for the emperor from the satraps
 saare aay kaa hisaab rakhane tathaa samrat ke bhaag kii nigaraanee karne ke liye rajkeey kysth rahata tha
 He used to get royal orders from the emperor
 is prakaar di hui ajna ke shighratisheeghra paalan kii aashaa kii jaati thi
 In this, even the barrier was considered rebellion
 kshatrapon ko iske liye dand bhi miltaa tha
 And like the Turkish Empire, there was no formality in their punishment
 kshatrapon ke paas samrat kii ajna pahunchaane kii vidhi ke liye ek din kii yatra kii duuri par ek vyakti rahata tha
 The message was sent to each other, to the third, thus to the satraps
 faras ke samraaton ke paas kshatrapon kii adheenta praapt karne ke liye anya prakaar bhi the ek kamishnar ko sena ke sangrakshan ke saath vaataavaran tathaa aavashyaktaa ke anusaar krupa pradaan karne athwa dand dene ke liye bheja jaataa tha
 According to Xenophon, this practice had been going on since the beginning of the empire and was prevalent during its time
 kshatrapon ke kaary kii nigaraanee ke liye samrat swayan samrajya ke prayek pradesh main prativarsh jaaya karata tha
 If he could not go on his own, he would have sent one of his representatives
 kshatrapon ke apane praant main bhoomi kii urvartaa athwa krishi kii abhivruddhi ke liye vishesh prayaas karne par unako kuch or bhi praant pradaan kar die jate kintu jahaan yah suvyavastha nahin praapt hoti thi vahaan se pradesh ko katkar duusare kshatrap praanton main mila diya jaataa tha
 The rule of administration in the provinces was on the emperor, who appointed his brother, a family or son-in-law as a satrap
 bharatvarsh main nahpaan ne apane damaad ushavadaat ko kshatrap bana rakhaa tha
 Due to the close relationship with the emperor, luxury was reflected in the life of satraps like the emperor
 kshatrap ke darbar main bhi samrat kii bhanti aupchaarikta barti jaati thi
 Like the emperor, Kshatrapas used to have their own Antapur
 antpur main clivon kii paryaapt sankhya rahati thi
 Apart from the royal army, there was a personal army of satraps
 samrat kii hi bhanti unke mehalon main bhi udyaan, pramadavan, aadi hote the
 Like emperors, they also used to travel from one place to another in certain months of the year
 kshatrapon ko is prakaar adhik rajkeey shakti swat praapt thi
 Apart from being the commander of military and other powers, there was one more thing, due to which the satraps became very powerful and there was a possibility of their rebellion
 kabhi kabhi ve vidroh kar bhi dete the
 Once the presidency of two or more Kshatrapa provinces was made a single Kshatrap, which was called Mahakshatrap
 inhen adhik sainyashakti tathaa rajkeey shakti praapt hoti thi jo unke vidroh main sahaayak hoti thi
 An example of this is found only during the reign of Darnavosh
 aarokliz ne, jo fijia tathaa lidia donon kaa kshatrap tha, vidroh kar diya tha parvarti shaskaon ke kaal main, visheshkar laghu asia main, kshatrapon ke vidroh adhik hone lage
 This trend of satrap has increased continuously since the time of the miniature Kurusha
 kshatrap kabhi kabhi khulaa vidroh bhi karte the or apane ko swatantra shaasha ghoshit kar dete the
 Many of these rebellious satraps established several dynasties and later became completely independent
 in sabake baavjood samrat unki adheenta praapt karne main safal rahata tha
 The main reason for this was mutual discord and war among the satraps
 iske atirikt darbar main striyon kii adhikta tathaa vyabhichaar ke vaataavaran se bhi kshatrapon ke vyaktitv main sahaj dheelaapan aane lagata tha
 The Kshatrapas did not consider themselves to be appointed for the protection of the provinces, but considered their suzerainty over them
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi tha ki kshatrapeey prashasan kii vyavastha anshat anuvanshik bhi thi
 They used to consume landlords and other incomes of Kshatrapa provinces
 xenophan ke samay misia ke ek kshatrap ne upakshatrap bhi niyukt kiya tha jise us pradesh ke log kar dete the or vah ulke badale vyavastha karata tha
 The same arrangement was done for his widow after his death
 is prakaar kii vyavastha ne samrajya ke dhaanche ko sahaj hi dhilaa kar diya
 In later times, the satraps also got the right to operate the state army, especially when it belonged to the royal family or some of its relatives
 laghukurush misia, fizia, tathaa lidia kaa kshatrap tha par yuddh main sampurna sena kaa senapati bhi vahi tha
 The same situation is also with the Farnbases and other satraps, but this does not mean that there was military rule in the Kshatrap provinces
 vastut samrat sainik tathaa samaaj ke adhikariyon, donon ko swayan niyukt karata tha
 He also used to appoint magistrates himself
 kshatrap magistriton ke kaary main hastkshep nahin kar saktaa tha
 The system of regional administration was adopted by Alexander and his successors as well, especially in the kingdom of Silukas
 bharatvarsh main shakon ke jo rajya sthapit hue unamem bhi kshatrapeey rajyavyavastha thi
 Indian satraps had three major dynasties and a dynasty- kapisha, pushppur tathaa abhisar ke kshatrapon kaa pataa vahaan se praapt abhilekhon se miltaa he
 In the Manikyala inscription, there is mention of a Kshatrap, son of Granvvrayak
 use kapisha kaa kshatrap bataaya jaataa he
 The Kabul Museum inscription of the 83rd year mentions a satrap named Tiruvarna of Pushpur
 abhisarprast se praapt ek taanbe kii anguthi ke aakaar kii mudra par kshatrap shivasen kaa naam praapt he
 The Kshatrapas of Punjab belong to three dynasties - mathura ke kshatrap - is vansh main sabase pehla rajuvul athwa ranjuvul tha jisane sambhawatah pehle sakal par bhi rajya kiya tha
 Stancono estimated that lineage as follows: rajuvul kaa naam abhilekhon tathaa mudraon main praapt hota he
 In the Mora Krupa inscription he is called Mahakshatrap
 kintu uski mudraon par praapt lekh main use 'rajaadhiraj' kaha gaya he
 Razuvul was succeeded by Shudas
 abhilekhon main bhi use mahakshatrap kaha gaya he
 Some scholars consider the years given in their inscriptions and some in Vikram Samvat
 is matbhed ko mitaane kaa saadhan abhi tak praapt nahin ho sakaa he
 According to Kono, Kharoshth was Rajvul's brother-in-law and according to Palit, Dahitra
 ek anya mudra par kharoshtee lipi main ‘kshatrapas prakhar ostas artsputras’ likhaa hua miltaa he
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding the origin of these satraps
 kabhi unhen palhaav, kabhi shaq desh se aayaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 Probably they were suspicious
 faras se hokar aane ke kaaran ve kshatrapeey shashan vyavastha se parichit or usase sambhddha ho gayi; inke atirikt hagaan or hagaamash naamak do kshatrapon kii bhi mudraayen mathura se praapt hui hai
 Which is supposed to be the ruler of Mathura after the Rajuvul dynasty
 kuch sikkon par donon ke sanyukt naam bhi milte hai or kuch par keval hagaamash kaa hi
 After them there were two to three Kshatrapas in Mathura, whose names are Indian
 kadachit is kaal tak in videshiyon ne purnroop se bhartiyata grahan kar lee thi
 Ujjain's Kshatrapas - Ujjain's Kshatrapas are also called as 'kshatrapas of Western India'
 ye kshatrap do vanshon ke prathit hote hai
 The first dynasty was of Bhumak and Nahapan and the second was of Chashtan
 bhumak ke uttaradhikari nahpaan kaa pataa uski rajat evam tamramudraon se hi nahin varan uske damaad ushavadaat ke abhilekhon se bhi lagaaya jaataa he
 Nahapan also ruled over some part of Western India
 usne satvaahan ke samrajya kaa kuch bhaag bhi jeet liya tha
 Its dynasty is called Shehrat
 shaharaat vansh ko rudradaaman pratham ne samaapt kiya
 In the Girnar inscription he is called Khakharat Vasnivasse Karas
 ujjain main shashan karne vaale dwitiya vansh ke kshatrapon main kardamakavansheey chashton ke pita yasmotik kaa naam sarvapratham aata he
 Chashthan's son Jayadaman was a Kshatrap but he probably died during his father's lifetime and Ujjain was ruled by Chasthan and Rudradamana together
 junagarh abhilekh main mahakshatrap rudradaaman ke sambandh main kaha gaya he ki usne mahakshatrap kii oopaadhi arjeet kii thi
 It seems that the kingdom of his dynasty was probably taken away by Gautamiputra Satakarni and Rudradamon had to earn the title of Mahakshatrap by winning those territories again
 junagarh abhilekh main uski vijayon tathaa uske vyaktitv kii prashasti he
 Rudradaman i was succeeded by his eldest son Damaghasad
 uske pashchaat damaghasad kaa putr jivadaman tathaa uskaa bhai rudrasingh pratham uttaradhikari hue
 It was during this Rudrasingh that the Abhiras captured some part of the state of the Western satraps
 rudrasingh pratham ke uttaradhikari uske teen putr rudrasen pratham, sanghdaaman tathaa damsen hue
 Subsequently, Damasen had three sons, Yashodaman, Vijayasena and Damajadashree Mahakshatrap
 daamajadashri kaa uttaradhikari uskaa bhatija rudrasen dwitiya hua
 After this, he had sons Vishwasinh and Bhartradamana
 bhartrudaman ke hi kaal se uskaa putr vishwasen uskaa kshatrap bana
 What was the relationship between Bhartradaman and Vishwasingh with Mahakshatrap Rudradaman II
 yah nishchaypurvak nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The last satrap of this dynasty was Rudrasingh III who ruled till about 388 AD

 The teachings assigned by Lord Buddha in sutta-pitaka are mainly compiled

 Because in the sutta-pitaka, the teachings of Lord Buddha and his principal disciples are mentioned
 is kaaran upaask-varg ke liye is pitak kaa bahut adhik mahatva he
 In the sutta-pitaka, the art of living the spiritual and physical life happily through beautiful similes and metaphors in a very simple and comprehensible style has been taught according to the Buddhist tradition

 The way the Angamukta body's Kesamuti Sutta talks about awakening scientific consciousness and intellectualism and denying superstitions and stereotypes is an example in itself
 dhai hajaar varshon purv itani aadhunik, vaigyanik tathaa taro-taaja vichaar-paddati ko upasthaapit karne vaale bhagwaan buddha sach hi kitne mahaan vaigyanik or vimarshak the
 Two and a half thousand years ago, Buddha said so many scientific things, which can show the path to science even today
 nishchay hi yah sutt vigyaan ke liye ek kasuti hi he
 The knowledge conveyed by addressing the Kalams in the Kesamutti Sutta of the Angusakya body holds a special place in the entire literature
 vastutah is sutt ke vaigyanik drushtikon ke kaaran hi buddha sahitya tathaa buddha-gyaan parampara pratishtha ko praapt hui
 Kesamuti Sutta is not very big in Pali language, but it has great importance
 isamen varnan aayaa he ki bhagwaan buddha apane vishaal bhikkhusangh sahit kosal janapad main charika karte hue cese-mutt naamak kalaamon ke nigam main pahunche
 The Kalam people also knew Suyash of Lord Buddha in the past as 'itipi so saffron arham sammasambuddho vijchacharanasampanno sugato lokavidu anutaro purisadhammasarathi sattha devamanusasan buddha saffron'
 atah ve bhagwaan buddha ke darshan karne ke liye unke paas pahunche
 Going to him, the Kalams, expressing their curiosity, asked, 'O bhunte! Some of the shraman-brahmins come to the case-mutt Corporation
 ve yahan apane hi mat kii prashansa karte hai tathaa dusron ke mat kii ninda karte hai or dusron ke mat ko nicha dikhaate hai
 Again, other shraman-brahmins do not get tired of coming here and praising their opinion and condemning the views of others
 ’1 After presenting his talk in this way to Lord Buddha, he asked God, 'O bhunte! Praising our opinion and polluting the opinion of others raises doubts in our minds about who has told the truth and who lies among these shraman-brahmins? tab kalaamon ke man ke shaq kaa shaman karte hue mahaan vaigyanik tathaa manashchikitsak bhagwaan buddha satya kii kasuti ko unke samaksh prastut karte hue kehete hai ki ‘he kalamo! shaq karnaa thik he
 Doubt is ok vastutah sandeh karne ke sthaan par hi sandeh utpann hua he
 ' he kalaamon! kisi tathy ko vefval isliye nahin maananaa chahie ki yah to parampara se prachlit he, athwa pracheen kaal se hi aisa kaha jaataa rahaa he, athwa yah dharmagranthon main kaha gaya he, athwa kisi vaad ke niraakaran ke liye is tathy kaa grahan samuchit he
 One should not accept any fact only because of size or gravity, but it should be accepted because it is a religion, is indescribable and if it is received, its fruit will be pleasant and beneficial
 2 How scientific, rational and hopeful are these things that have gone somewhere in Kesamuti Sutta
 uparyukt vishay ke kaaran hi vaigyanik chintan main mahati vraphanti kaa sutarapaat hua
 Later thinkers of the Buddha paid much attention to this subject

 Therefore, one should not blindly believe things that have been considered and heard for a long time
 koi baat yadi kisi pavitra dharm-granth main likhi ho tab bhi use bina vivek ke nahin maan lenaa chahie
 Regardless of any subject written in any scripture or book, prudent thinking is also necessary
