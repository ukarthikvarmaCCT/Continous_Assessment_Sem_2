 com / gr5b76exji kisi bhi naukari ko paane kii pehali seedhi rigeume sellection hota he
 Only after it is selected, you are called for an interview
 yahi nahin intervyuu main rigeume se jude sawaal bhi kiye jate hai
 So before going to the job interview, read your resume
 agar naukari ke liye aplai karne ja rahe hai, to rigeume banaate samay in baton kaa rakhen khaas dhyaan
 Do not use difficult words Do not use difficult words in your résumé
 agar aapako lagata he ki aap taff vards ko yuj kar acha impressant bana sakenge to aap galat he
 Try to use words that are commonly spoken
 agar aap kathin shabdon kaa prayog karte hai to uskaa matlab jarur jaane
 Take care of the font Take special care of the font while making the resume
 zyada bade yaa zyada font yuj karne se aapkaa rigeume bhadda dikh saktaa he or impressant bhi kharaab padataa he
 12 to 14 font size and Times New Roman font are considered standard
 Warning: job intervyuu ke dauraan karte hai ye 2 galtiyaan to sanbhal jaaembina matlab spes na deshgar aapako lagata he aap apane rigeume main zyada spes degen to vah saaf or spasht lagegaa to aap galat he
 Too much white space also spoils the look of your resume
 jahaan jaruri ho vahi spes kaa yuj karen
 Do not force force long resumes Many times it seems to us that if you make a 3-4 page resume, then you are wrong if you are called more talented
 kam shabdon main apni baat kehane kii koshish karen
 Longer resumes sometimes become boring, which the recruiter does not read completely and in such a way, the necessary information is also missed
 jab bos kaa chillaanaa ban jaae daily routine, to yun rakhen khud ko coolgrametical erar se bacherijume main gramatical galtiyaan akasar dekh jaati hai jisase recruiter ke saamne aapkaa impressant intervyuu ke pehle hi kharaab ho jaataa he
 Check the résumé frequently and send it to others only if it is checked by others
 ssailing mistek se bhi bachein
 Do not write unnecessary things, it is often seen that many people write things that they do not even know about themselves in order to increase the weight of the resume
 aisi chijen likhane se bachein kyonki agar aapane jo likhaa he uski jaankaree nahin he to aap intervyuu main sharminda ho sakate hai
 Before joining a new job, ask HR these 6 important questions: Passport size photo must be fixed
 An ideal resume is incomplete without your photo
 agar aapane rigeume banaate vakt photo nahin lagaai he to intervyuu main jane se pehle ek passport sies photo rigeume ke apper left main jarur laga den

 jahaan party ise aantarik ladaai bataa rahi he or party kii vittiya khastahal ko jimmedaar bataa rahi he vahiin, party ke varisht netaa in haar kii vajah ko party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii kshamtaaon main kami ko maan rahe hai
 It is a different matter that all of them are whispering and all are awaiting the result of elections in five states
 ek varisht congressi netaa ne kaha, sabase bada sawaal to yah he ki billi ke gale main ghanti koun baandhegaa
 Many party leaders believe that after the party's crushing defeat in 2014, Rahul Gandhi took over the reins of the party and tried to change the party and campaigned all over the country
 lekin abhi tak ke parinaam party ke liye utsahvardhak to nahin dikhaai de rahe hai
 The party is losing in one state after another and if seen, the party is slowly getting cleaned up
 party ke varisht netaaon kii chintaa yaheen nahin samaapt hoti he
 Everyone also has a problem that the party does not yet have any gameplan nor any strategy to take on the Narendra Modi government
 party netaaon ne naam na lene kii shart par to yahaan tak kaha ki rahul gandhi ke hamale abhi tak kargar siddh nahin hue hai or maharashtra or odisha main bijepi ko mili jeet kaa asar upi ke baaki bache charnon main matdaan par bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 The comments in netaaon kaa kahana he ki party main kaaphi dinon se chale badlaav se bhi zyada kuch hone kii ummid nahin dikhti he kyonki rahul gandhi ke netritv main javabdehi or parformens kabhi bhi paimaana nahin rahaa he
 This demand will once again pick up on whether Rahul Gandhi will take over as the party president and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will play a more active role or not
 kuch bhi ho, 11 march ko chunaav parinaamon kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi agar kuch badlaav nahin hua to sawaal congress netritv par to uthegaa hi
 This question will also be raised on the capabilities of Congress Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 maharashtra or odisha main hue sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main bijepi ke behatar pradarshan or congress ke phiseddi pradarshan par party ke netaaon main kaanaafoosee shuru ho gai he
 While the party is calling it an internal battle and blaming the financial crisis of the party, senior party leaders are considering the reason for the defeat as lack of capabilities of party vice president Rahul Gandhi
 yah alag baat he ki sabhi ke sabhi kaanaafoosee hi kar rahe hai or sabhi ko paanch rajyon main ho rahe chunaavon ke parinaam kaa intjaar he
 a senior Congress leader said, "the biggest question is who will tie the bell in the cat's neck
" kai party netaaon kaa maananaa he ki 2014 main party kii karaari haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne party kii kaman apane haath main le lee thi or puure desh main party main badlaav kaa prayaas kiya or puure desh main prachaar bhi kiya
 But the results so far are not encouraging for the party
 party ek ke baad ek rajya main harati ja rahi he or dekha jaae to dhire dhire party saaf hoti ja rahi he
 The concern of senior party leaders does not end here
 sabhi ko yah bhi dikkat he ki party ke paas abhi tak narendra modi sarkaar se takkar lene ke liye koi gemplan nahin he na hi koi ranneeti he
 Party leaders even said on condition of anonymity that Rahul Gandhi's attacks have not proved effective so far and bjp's win in Maharashtra and Odisha will have an impact on voting in the remaining phases of UP
 tippaniyan These leaders say that there is no hope of anything more than a change in the party for a long time as accountability and performance has never been a measure under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 yah maang ek baar phir jor pakadegi ki kya rahul gandhi party ke adhyaksh pad kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalenge or unki bahan priyanka gandhi wadra or zyada sakriy bhoomika nibhaaengi yaa nahin
 Whatever be the case, with the announcement of the election results on March 11, if nothing changes, then the question will arise on the Congress leadership

 " duusari ore, arun jetali se pehle vittamantri rahe congress ke pi chidambaram ne arun jetali ke 'dostana' bhaashan ke liye unka shukriya adaa kiya
 This harmony between the two sides is in part a result of the impact that states have had on supporting the GST, and according to the government, which could lead to an increase of up to two per cent in economic growth
 chidambaram ne kaha, "congress jiesti ke idia ke viruddh kabhi nahin thi
 
 
 The Finance Minister said this in a TV interview today, and we are thankful to him for accepting this
 
 
 " Chidambaram's party had prepared the draft proposal of GST to be applied in place of many central and state taxes

 After a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the process of introspection has started in the Congress 
 congress ke varisht netaaon kaa maananaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main haar kii badi vajah thi ki party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne sanghathan main bade badlaav kar saaf chhavi vaale yuvaaon ko badi bhoomika dene kii koshish kii thi
 According to the news published in the English newspaper 'the Economic Times', after the election, the tone of the protest in the Congress territories has increased, it seems that the party president Sonia Gandhi has now indicated that Rahul should step back and the senior leaders on the organization Has allowed the use of its bearing to continue
 party main ghataya jayega rahul kaa asarparty ko ummid he ki isse haryana, maharashtra or jharkhand main hone vaale chunaavon main party kii sthiti main sudhaar hoga
 The growing demand to formally include Priyanka Gandhi in the Congress has been seen by the Gandhi family as an attempt by senior leaders to shore up Rahul and deliberately weaken his influence
 priyanka ne party main koi badi bhoomika nibhaane se inkaar kiya he, lekin isse sonia ko party main rahul kii ore se kiye ja rahe nae prayogon ko rokane ke liye majaboor hona padaa he
 In Maharashtra, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has been allowed by the party to take over the electoral fray, but he is finding it very difficult

 Modi, addressing the people present on the occasion of the release of Smriti Sikka, said that he will visit the former Prime Minister's memorial on Tuesday to reiterate Vajpayee's ideology and his commitment to follow the path shown by him

 He created the Jana Sangh

 The controversy over the construction of the temple of Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, has been growing day by day
 ab nathuram godse kii bhatiji ne kaha he ki unki murti na lagaai jaae

 67-year-old Himani is the daughter of Nathuram's youngest brother Gopal Godse
 unke pita ko mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke aarope main 18 saal jail main kaatane pade
 He says that the controversy about making and installing the idol in this way is losing respect for Nathuram
 himani ne akhbaar se kaha ki nathuram deshbhakt the, jo apane kiye kii sajaa bhugatne ko taiyaar the
 He was not a 'supari killer' or a terrorist
 unhone kaha ki nathuram ne gandhi kii hatya kyon kii, ise samajhnaa hoga or jin kaarnon se unhone yah hatya kii, use samajhane se is desh main jis dhang se itihaas padhaayaa ja rahaa he, usamen badlaav aa saktaa he
 But those reasons cannot be understood by such disputes
 himani 'abhinav bharat' naamak sanstha kii pramukh hai
 The organization is accused of a bomb blast in Maharashtra
 himani kaa maananaa he ki congress ne godse ko baar-baar isliye nishaanaa banaaya ki vah brahman the
 In this way his image was tarnished

 isse pandit ji bahut bechaini mahasoos kar rahe the
 After all, he could not stand him and he came up on his own and kept playing Tanpura until the second player came

 iskaa aayojan pune main hota he or shastreey sangeet se jude kisi bhi kalakaar ke liye isame prastuti dena garv kii baat hoti he
 Returning to the corridors of memories, Mishra said, "he was the king of the Indian classical music world, and after Mian Tansen, Panditji's name as the classical singer is in people's minds
" vah mere chachaa pandit gopal mishra ke mitra the, isliye unhen dekhne or sunne kaa mauka evam unka sneh hamen bachapan se mila
 'he said that we were young after hearing that from childhood and later getting the opportunity to perform on stage with him many times was like a dream come true
 mishra ne aadhyatmik lahaze main kaha, ‘maanav sharir ko chhodkar ek na ek din har vyakti ko janaa hota hai, lekin vyakti ko aise karm karke janaa chahie ki vah amar ho jaye
 Panditji's mortal body may not be with us, but his soul will always be with us

 ’ The jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria have announced the establishment of an 'islamic Khilafat' on Sunday
 yah ek aisi vyavastha he, jiskaa kareeb sau saal pehle otoman samrajya ke patan ke saath hi ant ho gaya tha

 ek baar phir patrakarita ne phir apane chhile hue ghutane dekhe, zakhmi kuhaniyaan dekhi, kalai par bandhi pattiyaan dekhi− aise hi maukey ye bataane ke liye hote hai ki bhartiya loktantr kii buniyaad patrakarita ke lahu se bhi sinchi ja rahi he
 However, many people must have experienced sadistic pleasure after watching this beating of journalists on TV channels
 pehali khushi is baat kii hui hogi ki in maamuli press or channel waalon ko police ne unki haisiyat bataa di
 Told that she can chase and beat them like animals whenever she wants
 satalok ashram ke vah log bhi is pitayee par khush hue honge jinke baba kii manamaani media ne chalane nahin di
 Reminded that a man is showing a thumbs up to the administration and government and is defying the court
 police ko majaboor kiya ki vah karrwai kare

 patrakarita ne pitate hue log dekhe, unhen ghaseetati hui police dekhi or in sabko camere par utaarne kaa dussahas dikhaaya
 That's why journalists ran and tried to break their cameras hands and feet freshly
 patrakarita in dinon takat or paise kaa khel bhi maani jaati he− shaayad isliye ki hamaare samay kii bahut sari gandagiyaan hamaari patrakarita main bhi daakhil hui hai
 These days she is beginning to hear a stronger man's statement than a weak man's voice
 lekin in sabake baavjood, sari chamak−damak or takat ke satahi pradarshan ke baavjood patrakarita sabase zyada tab khilti he jab vah insaaf ke haq main khadi hoti he, jab vah ek magarur baba ko ashram main chupane par majaboor karti he or ek besharm vyavastha ko karrwai ke liye baadhya karti he
 She then drags the person who was beaten and injured during this action
 agar is sachai ke haq main khadey hone kii sazaa ye pitayee he, to patrakarita ko ye sazaa baar−baar manzur he, kyonki yahi use taaqat or vaidhata detii he, raghuveer sahay ke shabdon main is lajjit or parajeet samay main bhi bharosa detii he

 ramajaan (ramadan) maheene kii aakhri jumme kii namaaj 31 tarif ko padhi jaaegi

 Non-observance of these 3 rules is not complete, not only during Ramadan, but in Islam, every prayer (friday) is considered special in Islam

 For this reason, in Islam, along with Namaz, donations are also made on the day of Jumme

 meraa iraadaa kisi kii dharmik yaa duusari bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchane kaa nahin tha
 i apologize for this
 'seems my tweet about His Holiness has led 2misunderstanding

 com / skfjiaz35o — Hrithik Roshan (@ihrithik) April 2, 2016 In fact, the matter was that on January 28, Hrithik wrote in a tweet, 'more amazing women whose name is adding me to the media is more than a chance of an' Pope 'affair Can
 thanks lekin no thanks'
 This is why the Christian community sent Hrithik a legal notice to hurt his religious sentiments and asked him to apologize on the tweet made to the Pope, on which Hrithik apologized
 kya aap jaanate hai ki duniyabar main sabase adhighrabapatamerica uniwarsity main padhane vaale banate hai? velth eks or ubies kii ek shodh main yah nateeja nikal kar saamne aayaa he
 Accordingly, Mumbai University of India has made it to the top-10 of this list
 shodh ‘kis uniwarsity se nikalate hai sabase adhiurbapati’ vishay par kiya gaya
 While 16 of the top-20 were American universities, Mumbai University ranked 9th in the list, overtaking MIT, New York University, Michigan and even Columbia University
 is list main top par uniwarsity of penselvenia he
 25 people became billionaires after studying here
 duusare sthaan par 22 arbapatiyon ke saath harvard uniwarsity, 20 arbapatiyon ke saath uniwarsity of yel tisare, chauthe par uniwarsity of sadarn california (16) jabaki uniwarsity of princiton or cornel paanchaven sthaan par he jahaan se 14 arbapati nikle hai
 The most interesting thing has emerged in this survey that higher education is not the first requirement to become a billionaire because 35% of the 2,325 billionaires present in the world have not studied tertiary level degree
 is 35 fisadi main hi bill gates or mark jakarberg bhi shaamil hai jinhone apana bijness shuru karne ke liye harvard kii undergraduate padhai bich main hi chhod di thi
 The first 8 universities in this list are American, while the Mumbai University of India is held in 9th place with 12 billionaires
 mumbai uniwarsity se sirf ek paaydaan neeche yani 10wein sthaan par british uniwarsity he
 The most surprising thing is that it is the only British University in the top-20 and it is neither Oxford nor Cambridge, it is London School of Economics
 landan skool of iconomix se 11 arbapati nikle hai
 Among the billionaires who have attained tertiary level degrees, 42 per cent are graduates, 26 per cent post graduates, 21 per cent MBA and 11 per cent phd
 top-20 kii is list main mumbai unvarsity (9wein), landan skool of iconomix (10wein), moscow state uniwarsity (11wein), switsraland sthit itie jurikh (20wein) ke alaava sabhi 16 uniwarsity america hai
 Another interesting thing came out in this research that one-quarter of billionaires graduated from American universities are not born in American
 vahiin america uniwarsity se post graduate kiye arbapatiyon main se 40 fisadi america naagarik nahin hai
 Some of the funniest things about Indian billionaires have come to light
 bharat ke arbapati apni janmabhumi ko jaldi nahin chhodte
 While 95 percent of Indian billionaires were born there, they also have business, whereas the trend is different across the world
 puri duniya kii baat kii jaae to yah is maamle main keval 25 fisadi hi he
 Three out of every 10 Indian billionaires do not have a college degree, while 72 percent of Indian billionaires are at least graduates
 mahila arbapatiyon ke maamle main bharat is survey ke target deshon main sabase nichle paaydaan par he
 There are only 3 percent female billionaires here
 2013 kii tulana main duniyabar main arbapatiyon kii sankhya main 7 fisadi kii ijapha hua he or inaki sankhya 2,325 ho gai he
 The total wealth of these billionaires7
 3 trillian dollar ho gai he
 It has also been predicted that by 2020, the number of billionaires will be 3,800 worldwide

 aam aadmi party ne iees adhikariyon par raajnneetik bayaan dene kaa aarope lagaaya he
 AAP leaders have also asked 6 questions to the IAS Association citing service rules
 pravaktaa ashutosh ne sarvice conduct rule ke ulanghan ke chalate IAS adhikariyon par mukadmaa darj karne kii maang kii he
 Aam Aadmi Party national spokesperson Ashutoshne said that the Aam Aadmi Party not only condemns the atmosphere being created by senior officials within Delhi, but also says that all this is being done under a big conspiracy
 
 mukhya sachiv ke ek bayaan ke aadhaar par aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, lekin vahiin sachivalay main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ke mantri or duusare logon par hue hamale main police koi karrwai nahin kar rahi he
 During the press conference, the party alleged that under the Service Conduct Rule, it is clear that the government officials cannot make any political rhetoric nor they can indulge in any activity like strike or Protest
 varisht adhikari kisi bhi tarah kaa raajnneetik bayaan nahin de sakate, lekin baavjood iske phir bhi twitor or fasebuk ke madhyam se adhikari aam aadmi party kii sarkaar or mukhyamantri ke kilaaf raajnneetik bayaanbazi kar rahe hai or sarkari ofis kaa istemaal karte hue raajnneetik hamalebaazi kii ja rahi he
 It is clear from some social media accounts related to the officers that IAS officers are also doing the Protest and also saying that they are not going to any kind of government meeting
 iees adhikariyon se AAP ke 6 sawaal:1
 The case of alleged assault with the Chief Secretary is under the cognizance of the court, investigation and trial is going on, despite its officials demanding an apology from the Chief Minister which is unfair
 adhikari aisa kiske ishaare par kar rahe hai? kya adhikariyon ko kanoon or nyaayalay par bharosa nahin he?2
 Has any senior officer uttered a word about the fight with the minister in the Secretariat? Why so? Is it that the officers are also involved in this conspiracy? 3
 sarvice rule ke mutabik sarkari afasar kisi bhi tarah kii raajnneetik bayaanbazi nahin sakate, lekin wo aisa kyon kar rahe hai or kiski shah par kar rahe hai?4
 Why not take departmental action against such officers? 5
 sarkari parisar or sarkari karyaalay kaa istemaal raajnneetik bayaanbazi ke liye kyon ho rahaa he?6
 Why should not the call details of all these officers be investigated, after all, you should know who these officials have talked to, which are the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party? uttar pradesh ke gajiabad ke modi nagar main police ek naaballig ladki ko uske gaayab hone ke ek maheene baad bhi uskaa koi suraag nahin laga pai
 Not only this, the local people sat on a dharna near the police station police station for 2 days
 inase milane koi police adhikari nahin pahucha to police ke khilaaf dharne par baithne vaale log naaraazgi jataate hue thane ke baahar hi dharne par baith gaye or unhone thane kaa gheraav bhi kiya
 The aggrieved family sitting on the dharna alleges that they have also given three CCTV footage and all the call details of the day of the girl's disappearance to the police
 iske baavjood bhi police unki bacchee ko dhundne main naakaam rahi
 He has alleged that the police has not made any concerted effort to find his daughter
 peedit parivaar kaa yah bhi aarope he ki abhi tak ladki ko dhundne ke liye jo bhi kharchaa kiya ja rahaa he
 That too is being done by the aggrieved family
 baharhaal is puri ghatana ke baad se sthaneey logon main behad rosh he or kotwali police ke khilaaf behad naaraazgi bhari hui he
 Finally, after getting upset, hundreds of local people gathered with the victim's family and sat on a dharna at the police station police station
 police adhikariyon ke bacchee ko jald dhundne ke aashwaasan ke baad hi log thane ke baahar se hate
 People sitting on the dharna say that 15 days ago they had also laid siege to the CO office and they were told about all the action taken so far by the police station police station, after which the CO had asked for 3 days but Since then, even after 15 days, the police has not been able to take any concrete action and even today has only assured to find the student

 Despite this information was given to the local police, nothing has been known about the girl yet
 sisitivi footage main dikhi baccheejo sisitivi footage peedit parivaar ne police ko saunpe hai unamem chaatra ghar se nikal kar tution ke liye jaati dikhaai de rahi he
 Also, a suspicious young man is seen behind the girl
 bataa den ki thana modinagar kotwali police kaa yah koi pehla maamla nahin he
 Earlier too, a girl had suddenly vanished here
 police ne thik isi tarah dhulmul ravaiya apanaaya gaya tha jiskaa parinaam yah niklaa ki ladki kii laash kuch din baad bhojpur ilaake main ek khet main padi mili thi
 Taking action thereafter, the then SSP suspended all policemen posted at Kotwali
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ravivaar ko dilli main party ke 84wein mahadhiveshan main apane kaaryakartaaon ko do kahaniyaan sunaayi
 In this address of Rahul, Congress workers cheered him many times by cheering and during this time 'change is time', 'rahul tum kaljon
 
 Like slogans were also raised
 haalanki, rahul kii do kahaniyon ke dauraan congressi kaaryakarta maun sadhakar kahani sunate rahe or kahaniyaan khatm hone ke baad unki ore se waisi taaliyaan nahin sunai deen, jaisi duusare muddon par sunai de rahi thim
 Looking at this reaction, possibilities are being raised that perhaps the activists did not understand the end of the story
 rahul ne ye do kahaniyaan haal main gujarat main hue vidhansabha chunaavon ke sambandh main sunaayi
 In these elections, the Congress performed better than many election experts had expected
 bhale hi congress sarkaar banane main naakaam rahi, lekin congressi netaa apane pradarshan se santusht najar aae
 Ever since these results have come, the Congress leaders keep mentioning the results of these elections
 rahul ne kaha, 'gujarat ke chunaav main logon ne kaha ki main mandir main jaataa hum
 But i already go not only to temples but also to mosques, churches and gurudwaras
 main aapako mandir jane kii do kahaniyaan sunaata hum
 'rahul said,' Once there was a temple of Shiva, there was worship, Pandits were sitting, the worship was over
 maine pandit ji se sawaal poocha- guru ji, ye bataaie aapane kiya kya? doodh daalaa, pani daalaa, mantra pade, lekin aapane puja main kiya kya? pandit ji ne kaha- pehle apane security waalon ko dur karo, maine kiya
 Then he made me stand on the wall behind the temple, said- Put a forehead on the wall
 maine lagaaya to unhone kaha- ek baat bataata hum, main yahaan kaa nahin hum, kashmir kaa hum, logon ko mat bataanaa
 If you are looking for God, you will find it anywhere
 mandir, masjid, carch, gurudware, ped main, aasmaan main
 
 
 Will be found everywhere
 maine kaha- dhanyavad guru ji or main chalaa gaya
 'rahul said in another story,' Again it was the same temple of Shiva, it was a worship, a pandit
 maine bhi vahi sawaal kiya
 There is a habit of asking questions
 pandit ne kaha- betaa ye mat puch
 i was adamant, i asked again
 pandit ji ne kaha- maine puja kar di he, tum pradhanmantri banane ja rahe ho
 Then said - what is on the roof of the temple? i said - it is cement, he said - When you become PM, put gold on the roof
 ' ek vyakti sachai kahata he
 One makes things, tells lies
 rahul kii duusari kahaniyaha par khatm ho gai thi
 However, the audience felt that the story had survived and they were waiting for its completion
 lekin rahul tab tak duusare vishay par bolne lage the
 Shahabuddin, a former RJD MP from mafia don and Siwan, has been shifted from Siwan jail to Bhagalpur Central Jail
 siwan main patrkaar rajdev ranjan kii hatya ke baad buudhvaar ko jail main chhapemari ke dauraan kareeb 63 log hiraasat main bhi liye gaye hai, jo shahabuddin se milane aae the
 With such a large number of people meeting Shahabuddin everyday, it can be clearly understood what their status in Siwan jail is
 itane logon kaa ek saath milanaa kahin na kahin niyamon kaa bhi ulanghan he
 IG Jail Anand Kishore said that he has been shifted on the basis of dm's report
 bataaya jaataa he ki ravivaar or buudhvaar ko jail main shahabuddin se milane kaaphi taadaad main log aate the
 Most of the people used to come with their problems
 shahabuddin vahiin se farmaan jari karte the
 In a way, they used to have Janata Darbar inside the jail, where the problems of the people would be solved
 bataate chalem ki patrkaar rajdev ranjan kii hatya ke maamle main shahabuddin andeh ke ghere main hai
 According to DM and SP, they did not conduct raids in the jail, instead they came to take stock of security
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki patrkaar kii hatya kaa jail conection conform karne ke liye chapa maaraa gaya tha
 Even before this, Shahabuddin has been shifted from Siwan many times
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bhi unako bhagalpur shift kiya gaya tha
 But after the formation of the Grand Alliance government in the state, he was sent back to Siwan
 haalanki jila prashasan nahin chahta tha ki unako siwan jail main rakhaa jaae
 The impact of rjd's emergence as the single largest party in the coalition government was clearly visible in Siwan
 shahabuddinse milane waalo kii sankhya main baari ijapha hone laga
 Poison began to dissolve in Siwan's climate, which had changed for the last 10 years
 bihar sarkaar ke mantri abdul gafoor ke siwan jail ja kar shahabuddin se milane or isaki tasviir fasebuk par share karne se aparaadhiyo ke hausale buland hue
 People started living in fear
 patrkaar kii hatya sejangalrajka aarope jhel rahi nitish sarkaar ke liye shahbuddin ko siwan jail se shift karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
