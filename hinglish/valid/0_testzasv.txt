 bengal vibhaajan ke nirnay kii ghoshnaa 19 july 1905 ko bharat ke tatkaaleen visarai lard karjan dwaara kii gayi thi
 It was decided to divide Bengal of India into two parts for the purpose of creating a Muslim majority province
 vibhaajan 16 oktober 1905 se prabhavi hua
 In history it is also known as Bangabhang
 yah angrejon kii "foot daalo - raaj karo" vaali niti kaa hi ek ang tha
 Therefore, in 1908 AD, the 'bang-bhang' movement started in protest against it
 is vibhaajan ke kaaran utpann ucch stareey raajnneetik ashaanti ke kaaran 1911 main dono taraf kii bhartiya janata ke dabaav kii vajah se bengal ke purvi evam pashchimi hisse punah ek ho gaye
 The area of bengal province was 489,500 square kilometers and the population was more than 8 crore
 purvi bengal bhugolic rup se evam kam sanchaar sadhano ke kaaran pashchimi bengal se lagbhag alag-thalag tha
 In 1836, the Upper Provinces were brought under the rule of a Lieutenant Governor and in 1854 the Governor general-in-council was relieved of the direct administration of Bengal
 alag chif-kamishnarship banane ke liye 1874 main assam ko silahat sahit, bengal se alag kar diya gaya or baad main 1898 main lushai hills ko bhi isamen shaamil kar diya gaya
 It was very difficult to manage a large and so populous province like Bengal
 sarvapratham 1903 main bengal ke vibhaajan ke bare main sochaa gaya
 Additional proposals were also made to merge the districts of Chittagang and Dhaka and Mamansingh with Bengal and Assam
 isi prakaar chota nagpur ko bhi kendriya praant se milaayaa janaa tha
 The 19th session of the Congress was also held in Madras in 1903
 usee avasar par uske sabhapati shri lalamohan ghosh ne apane abhibhaashan main sarkaar kii pratikriyaavaadi niti kii aalochana karte hue ek akhil bhartiya manchapar asann vangbhang kii soochna di
 He said that such a conspiracy is going on
 sarkaar ne aadhikarik taur par 1904 kii janvari main yah vichaar prakashit kiya or farvari main lord karzan ne bengal ke purvi jilon main vibhaajan par janata kii raay kaa akalan karne ke liye adhikarik daure kiye
 He consulted with prominent personalities and made speeches in Dhaka, Chittagong and Mamansingh to try to explain the government's stand on partition
 henry jon stedman coton, jo ki 1896 se 1902 ke bich assam ke mukhya ayukta the, ne is vichaar kaa virodh kiya
 Speaking from the post of Chairman in the next session of Congress, Sir Henry Cotton also said that if there is an excuse that such a large province cannot be handled by a governor, then either the governing council of Bengal, like Bombay and Madras, will be in the vicinity of the Governor or Bengali
 Speakers should be separated and made a province
 un dinon bengal praant main bihar or urisa bhi shaamil the
 But the British government neither cared for Congress nor did it hold public opinion
 us samay ke vysarai or governor general lard karjan ne land holders association yaa jameendaar sabha main logon ko yah samajhane kii cheshtaa kii ki vangbhang se laabh hi hoga
 He himself went to East Bengal too, but none other than a handful of Muslims supported this proposal
 musalamaanon main pratishthit dhaka ke tatkaaleen nawab ne bhi pratham aavesh main iskaa virodh kiya tha
 Bengal was partitioned in 1905 on 16 October by Lord Curzon, the then Voice Rai of India
 vibhaajan ko prashaskeey kaaryon ke liye protsaahit kiya gaya, bengal lagbhag france jitna bada tha jabaki uski aabaadi france se kahin adhik thi
 It was thought that the eastern region was neglected and not properly governed
 praant ke bantwaare se poorviy kshetra main behatar prashasan sthapit kiya ja saktaa tha jisase antat vahaan kii janata skool or rojgaar ke maukon se labhanvit hoti
 However, other motives were also hidden behind the plan of partition
 bengali hindu, shashan main adhik se adhik bhagidaari ke liye rajnatik andolan main agrani the, atah ab purv main muslimon kaa varchasv badhane se unki sthiti kamjor ho rahi thi| hindu or muslim dono hi ne vibhaajan kaa virodh kiya| vibhaajan ke baad, haalaanki, lagbhag rashtriya str par british virdohi andolan prabal hua jisamen ki ahimsak or hinsak virodh pradarshan, bahishkaar or yahan tak ki pashchim bengal ke nae praant ke rajyapal kii hatya kaa prayaas bhi shaamil tha
 On 20 July 1905 Vangabhang's proposal was struck down by the Secretary of India, despite strong public opposition
 rajshahi, dhaka tathaa chatagaanv kamishnariyon ko assam ke saath milakar ek praant banaaya gaya, jiskaa naam purvavang or assam rakhaa gaya or baaki hissaa yani presidensi or vardhaman kamishnariyaan bihar, ud or iskaa koi aadhaar tha
 On this occasion, Hindus and Muslims were tried to fight, saying that this division would benefit the Muslims as they would have a majority in the East and Assam
 dhaka ke nawab ne pehle virodh kiya tha, par jab vangbhang ho gaya to vah uske paksh main ho gaye
 Sir Joseph Bamfield Fuller became the former and the new Lieutenant Governor of Assam
 kaha jaataa he, unhone kai jagah khullamakhulla kaha ki hindu or musalmaan unki do bibiyaan hai, inamen se musalmaan unki chaheti hai
 The meaning of this statement was clear
 vangbhang kaa uddeshy prashasan kii suvidha utpann karnaa nahin tha, jaisaa daawa kiya gaya tha, balki iske do spasht uddeshy the, ek hindu musalmaan ko ladaana or duusare navjaagrath bengal ko chot pahunchaana
 If seen in depth, it was the seed planting of Pakistan from here
 muslim lig ke 1906 ke adhiveshan main jo prastaav paas hue, unamem se ek yah bhi tha ki vangbhang musalamaanon ke liye acha he or jo log iske viruddh andolan karte hai, ve galat kaam karte hai or ve musalamaanon ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Later, in the 1908 session of the League, it was also passed that the proposal of the Congress to oppose Vangabhang was not worthy of acceptance
 nae praant main pahari rajya tripura, chittagong mandal, dhaka or rajshahi shaamil hue or malda jile ko assam praant main mila diya gaya
 Bengal not only had to leave these large eastern states, but also five Hindi-speaking states had to be lost to the Central province
 pashchim kii taraf se ise madhya praant se sambalpur or paanch chote oriya-bhashi rajya pradaan kiye gaye
 Bengal had an area of 141,580 square miles and a population of five crore forty lakhs, of which four crore twenty lakhs were Hindus and ninety million Muslims
 nae praant kaa naam kramshah purvi bengal or assam tha jisamen purvi bengal kii rajdhani dhaka or assam kaa adhinsth mukhyalay chittagong tha
 Its area was 106,540 square miles and the population was thirty million, of which one crore eight million Muslims and one crore twenty lakh Hindus
 prashasan ke liye vahaan ek vidhaan parishad tathaa ek dwi-sadasyeey rajasav board tha or kalakatta ucch nyaayalay ke adhikaar-kshetra ko badla nahin gaya tha
 The government pointed out that there would be a properly defined western border between East Bengal and Assam and would have well-defined geographical, necrological, linguistic and social features
 bharat sarkaar ne apana antim nirnay 19 july 1905 ke sweekrut prastaav se prachaarit kiya or bengal kaa vibhaajan usee varsh 16 oktober se lagu ho gaya
 Before its abolition in 1911, the division lasted barely half a decade
 haalaanki bantwaare ke peeche britain kii niti divide at impera thi, jo ki punarsangathit praant ko prabhavit karti rahi
 In 1919, separate electoral system was established for Muslims and Hindus
 is se pehle, donon samudaayon ke kai sadasyon ne sabhi bengaaliyon ke liye rashtriya ekta kii vakaalat kii thi
 Now, individual communities developed their own political issues
 muslimon ne bhi apni samgr sankhyatmak shakti ke bal par, jo ki mote taur par do karod bees lakh se do karod assi lakh ke bich thi, vidhanmandal main varchasv hasil kiya
 The demand for the creation of two independent states for Hindus and Muslims at the national level began to arise, with most Bengali Hindus now favoring the partition of Bengal on the basis of Hindu majority area and Muslim majority area
 muslim ab puure praant ko muslim rajya, pakistan kaa hissaa bananaa chaahate the
 Bengal split for the second time in 1947, this time on religious grounds
 yah purvi pakistan ban gaya
 However, after a successful liberation war with Western Pakistani military rule in 1971, East Pakistan became an independent state called Bangladesh
 bengal ke donon vibhaajanon main raktapaat hua
 This created a major political crisis
 purvi bengal main muslimon kii dharna thi ki ek alag kshetra unhen shiksha, rojgaar aadi ke adhik avasar uplabdh karaayega, jabaki pashchimi bengal ke logon ko yah bantwaaraa pasand nahin aayaa or is samay ke dauraan badi maatra main rashtravaadi sahitya kii rachana kii gayi
 The protest by the Indian National Congress was led by Sir Henry John Stedman Cotton, formerly the Chief Commissioner of Assam, but Curzon remained unmoved
 baad main coton ne, jo ab purvi naatingham ke udaaravaadi saansad ban gaye the, sar bempfield fuller, jo purvi bengal ke pehle leftinent-governor the, ko nikaalane ke abhiyaan kaa safalataa purvak sanchaalan kiya
 In 1906 Rabindranath Tagore composed Amar Shonar Bangla, the rally slogan of those who opposed partition, became the national anthem of Bangladesh in 1972
 in raajnneetik virodhon ke kaaran, bengal ke donon bhaag 1911 main phir se jud gaye the
 a new partition took place that divided the province on linguistic lines in place of religious, thereby separating the Hindi, Oriya and Assamese speaking areas into new administrative units
 iske saath hi saath british bharat kii prashasnic rajdhani ko kalakatta se nai dilli le jaaya gaya
 However, the conflict between Muslims and Hindus resulted in the creation of new laws to satisfy the political needs of both classes
 bangbhang ke viruddh bengal ke baahar bahut baari andolan hua
 Famous poets and litterateurs played an important role in this movement
 is andolan ne bankimchandra chattopadhyaay ke vande maataram geet ko nai bulandiyaan pradaan kii
 At that time the English cycle of dividing Bengal was broken, it gained extraordinary fame all over the country and abroad

 The study of the immune system has been named immunology
 iske adhyayan main pratiraksha pranali sambandhi sabhi bade-chote kaarnon kii jaanch kii jaati he
 In this, knowledge of the beneficial and harmful causes of system based health is done
 pratiraksha pranali ke kshetra main khoj or shodh nirantar jari hai evam isse sambandhit gyaan main nirantar badhottaree hoti ja rahi he
 This system is found in almost all advanced organisms like every plant and animal
 pratiraksha pranali ke kai pratirohak jeevon ko bimariyon se bachaate hai, inamen yantric, rasayan or jaev pratirohak hote hai
 The body's power to prevent infectious diseases is called immunity
 kintu sabhi shaktiyaan pratiraksha main nahin gini jaatin
 The skin does not allow bacteria to enter the body
 amashayik ras kaa amla jeevanuon ko nasht kar detaa he, kintu yah pratiraksha ke antargat nahin aata
 These are natural means of protecting the body
 pratiraksha se arth he brahya proteinon ko rakt main upasthit vishisht vastuon dwaara nasht kar daalane kii shakti
 Bacteria that enter the body produce proteins by dissolving their bodies
 unki nasht kar dene kii shakti rakt main hoti he
 The form of this action is chemical and physical, although this power is natural to some extent, but it is particularly acquired and due to the entry of bacteria and viruses into the body, these things destroy the body
 yah vishisht pratiraksha kehalaati he
 The germs of these diseases are entered into the body of the creature, then the body itself creates the things that destroy them
 yah sakriy rog kshamta he
 To produce it, the thing that is inserted into the body is called a vaccine
 jab ek jantu ke sharir main vaxin pravisht karne se sakriy kshamta utpann ho jaati he, to uske sharir se thodaa rakt nikaalkar, uske serum ko pruthak karke, usko duusare jantu ke sharir main pravisht karne se niskriy kshamta utpann hoti he
 That is, the body of one animal produces those bactericidal items and these immune items are entered into the body of another animal and they are endowed with curative power
 yah hui niskriy pratiraksha
 It is used a lot in medicine
 diphtheria, titanas aadi rogon kii isi prakaar taiyaar kiye gaye antitoxic serum se chikitsa kii jaati he
 Blood has many types of bactericidal powers
 rakt kii shwet kanikaon main jeevanu tathaa sab bahya vastuon ko kha jane kii shakti hoti he
 This function is called bacteriology
 rakt jeevanuon ko galaa detaa he, jo jeevanulayan kaha jaataa he
 The reason for this is a chemical substance present in the blood, which is called bacteriolysin
 rakt main jeevanuon ko baandh dene kii bhi shakti hoti he
 The infectious animals reach the body and are made from a bunch of bacteria
 unki gatishakti nasht ho jaati he
 This phenomenon is called agglutination and the object that causes it is called agglutinin
 jeevanu sharir main jeevvish utpann karte hai
 The immune bacterium also produces powers that kill these poisons, which are called antigenic poisons
 ye vishisht vastuen hoti hai
 The disease against which immunity is done, it destroys or destroys the bacteria of the same disease
 yahi vishisht pratiraksha kehalaati he
 Blood also has the power to dissolve the blood cells of other animals, which is called bleeding
 sakriy pratiraksha utpann karne ke liye rogon ke jeevanuon ko sharir main pravisht kiya jaataa he
 Immunity against bacteria is produced by the bacteria of a single disease
 pravisht karne se purv jeevanuon kii shakti or sankhya donon ko itnaa gata diya jaataa he ki usase jantu ko haani na pahunche, arthath itnaa bhayankar rog na ho ki uski mrityu ho jaay
 With this first volume, the animal gets a mild attack of disease, but things start destroying those bacteria in his body
 jin vastuon ko pravisht kiya jaataa he, ve pratijan kehalaati hai or unase rakt main pratipind banate hai
 a few days later a second quantity of animals is given, in which the number of bacteria is already two times or more
 jantu isko bhi sahan kar letaa he
 After a few days, a third dose is given, which is more than the second
 isse bhi jantu kuch hi din main ubar aata he
 Similarly, the quantity is increased equally until the animal tolerates several hundred times more than the first
 is samay tak jantu ke rakt main bahut badi maatra main pratipind ban chuktaa he
 Hence the animal is completely immune
 rogon ke akraman main bhi yahi hoti he
 Antibodies are formed in the body
 yahi sakriy pratiraksha hoti he
 To produce it, the solution of bacteria which is entered in the body is usually called vaccine
 is prakaar kii pratiraksha chirsthayee bhi hoti he
 After generating the appropriate capacity, after separating the serum from the blood of that animal, after being purified by chemical methods, it is used for healing
 jab is serum ko rogi ke sharir main pravisht kiya jaataa he, to usamen niskriy pratiraksha utpann hoti he, arthath serum main upasthit pratipindon ke kaaran uskaa sharir to pratiraksha se sampann ho jaataa he, kintu rogi kaa sharir pratiraksha utpann nahin karata
 Antibodies and antibodies that produce immunity are produced by another body
 keval rogi ke sharir main pravisht kar die jate hai
 Serum is used in the treatment of diseases
 serum main upasthit prativish kii maatra nirdhaarit kar lee gai he or usko antarrashtriya ekank kaha jaataa he
 It is used for both prevention and treatment
 nimnlikhit rogon kii vishesh oshadhi antiserum he : 1
 Diphtheria - The special action of its organism is the destruction of the local tissues, the decay of the muscles of the heart, the destruction of the umbilical cord, leading to endemic paralysis
 sharir ke samast utakon par uskaa vishaiylla prabhaav hota he
 Antivirus resolves this poison, but its quantity should be sufficient for the amount of venom
 yah bhalee bhanti pramanit ho chukaa he ki prativish isaki vishisht oshadhi he
 The statistics of Fibiger are as follows: Of the 239 patients treated per year, only 3

 Shyamalan approached film score composer James Newton Howard to work on Unbreakable soon after The Sixth Sense
 "vah vahaan baith gaya or mujhe puri film kii kahani sunaayi", harvard ne kaha
 "I have not seen a director who has done this for me till date
" Shyamalan wanted a "personality" tone for the music
 "vah kuch aisa chahta tha jo bilkul alag ho, bahut vishisht ho, log jab ise sunen to turant film dekhnaa chahen
" harvard ne bataaya
 Howard and Shyamalan simplified the score and reduced the number of instruments, limiting the music
 kuch rachanaaon ko landan main ek parivartit carch main record kiya gaya
 "you could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles and it would have been nice, but there is something else in the church studio's voice," commented Howard
 "yah nishchit rup se adhik rahasypurna sa lagata he" Filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith felt that the Unbreakable comic book resembles Mage: The Hero Discovered

 abert ko vishvas tha ki wilis kaa 'sookshm abhinay' uski "buddhiheen ection filmon" ke aam kaam se sakaaratmak rup se alag tha
 Richard Corliss of Time magazine reviewed that Unbreakable retained Shyamalan's writing / direction with "the horror and balanced refinement found in all films"
 washington post se desan thomson ne likhaa ki "thik vaisaa hi jaisaa ki lekhak-nirdeshak em
 nit shyamalan ne da siksth cens main kiya he, yah film bhi aapako ek aakarshak bhulbhulaiya main le jaati he, yah ek vaikalpik brahmand he jo thik hamaari naak ke neeche ke suraakh main he

 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is referred to as the British ruler, but in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 britain kii rajatantric vyavastha main, raja / rani ko rashtrapramukh kaa darj diya gaya he
 In the British political system, which has been progressively developing and changing over a period of thousands of years, the traditional and real powers of the ruler have been fluctuating

 And it is mandatory to obtain royal assent to all the Parliamentary Acts to be legal

 Therefore, most of the works done by the rulers in the name of Rajmukut, whether done by the ruler himself, such as the Queen's address or the state inauguration of Parliament, the decisions of Surrey work are taken elsewhere: vidhayik kaary maharani sasansaad dwaara, sansad, house of lords or house of comons kii salaah or sweekruti dwaara kiya jaataa he, vahin, kaaryakari shaktiya maharani ke naam par unki mahima kii sarkaar dwaara abhyayit kiye jate hai

 If a minority government demands dissolution of Parliament and declaration of new elections, the ruler is completely free to reject such demand

 Rajmukut plays a minor role in English Girja
 carch ke varishthatam padri, cantarbari ke archbishap, is carch tathaa vishwa bhar ke angalikai sampradaay ke aadhyatmik netaa ke rup main dekhe jate hai
 And the Adhirat also takes the oath of patronage of the Church of Scotland, and is also responsible for appointing the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church, otherwise, he has no meaningful role in Girja's work, nor does he have any authority over it 
 visthapit carch of wales tathaa carch of ireland main samprabhu kaa koi aupchaarik bhoomika nahin he

 parantu bharat ne rashtramandal kii sadsyta barqaraar raakhi
 Since then, in Commonwealth countries, the British sovereign is also given the position of "head of the Commonwealth", which is the nominal head of the organization of the Commonwealth
 is pad kaa koi rajnatik arth nahin he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries

 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament

 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession

 And an annual grant is also allocated for maintenance of royal residences and official visits to the queen

 In 1760, King George III agreed to abandon his hereditary Rajavan for the civil list, which lasted until 2012
 varttman samay main mukutiyaa esteton se ai mudra kii maatra civil list yaa adhirat ko pradaan kiye jane vaale anya anudaanon se bhi adhik he
 Thus between 2007-08 Crown Estates increased the treasury by £ 200 million, while 40 million pounds were paid by Parliament
 atah 7

 Since 2012, the parliamentary grant and the civil list have been merged and replaced with a narrow sovereign grant
 mukutiy sampada kii tarah hi lankaster kii dachi kii bhoomi va sampattiyaan bhi shahi nyaas ke antargat raakhi gayi he
 All this is part of the royal allowance
 is dachi dwaara utpann rajasav ko shaasha ke "nijee kharchon" ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he, jo naagarik suchi dwaara vahan nahi kiye jate hai
 Similarly, the Duchy of Cornwall is an area, allotted for the personal expenses of the ruler's eldest son in trust
 samprabhu, mulya vardhit kar jaise apratyaksh karon ke paatr he, or 1993 se iskar tathaa puunji laabh kar ke bhi

 Cancer is a class of different diseases that vary widely in their causes and biology
 koi bhi jeev, yahaan tak ki paudhon, main bhi karkat cancer ho saktaa he
 Almost all cancer cancers grow slowly, cancer and cancer cells and its daughter cells cause an error
 koi bhi cheez jo pratikruti karti he sambhavatya trutiyon se peedit ho sakati hai 
 yadi truti sudhaar or rokthaam thik prakaar se na kiya jaye trutiyaan bani rahengi or putree koshikaon ko bhi sthanantarit ho sakati hai

 For example, such an atmosphere may contain disruptive elements known as carcinogens
 yaa aavadhik chot ho sakati he, yaa vaataavaran jisamen koshikaayen apane astitv ke liye viksit nahin hui hon, jaise hypoxia 
 In this way, cancer is a progressive disease and these progressive errors keep accumulating in the cell gradually until the cell present in the animal starts to work in opposite to its functions
 ve trutiyaan jo karkat kaa kaaran hoti hai, aksar swa-pravardhansheel hoti hai, antat ek ghaateey dar par badhati hai
 for example: is prakaar se karkat aksar kuch trutiyon ke kaaran ek shrinkhalaa abhikriya ke rup main visphotit hota he, ye trutiyaan sanyukt hokar adhik gambhir trutiyaan banaati hai
 Errors that cause more errors are effectively the root cause of cancer and, at the same time, the reason that cancer treatment is very difficult: even after killing all of the cancer's 10,000,000,000 cells
 , Only 10 cells of them can do their replication or send the error-causing signals to other cells then the process starts again

 Many cancers are caused by a virus infection; This is especially seen in birds such as animals, but also in humans, viruses are responsible for 15% of human cancers worldwide
 maanav ke cancer se sambandhit mukhya virus hai maanav pepiloma virus, hepatitis bi or hepatitis si virus, epstin-baar virus or maanav tii -limphotropic virus
 Experimental and epidemiological data indicate a causative role of viruses and have emerged as the second most important risk factor for the development of cancer in humans, with the first factor being tobacco use
 virus-prerit ganthon ko do prakaaron main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale or dhire dhire roopantarit hone vaale 
 In rapidly converting viruses, the virus carries a hyperactive oncogene called viral-oncogene and the infected cell quickly mutates with the expression of v-onc

 Lump suppressor genes are often disabled by genetic changes that promote cancer
 aamtaur par, ek saamaanya koshika ko cancer koshika main roopantarit karne ke liye kai jeenon main parivartan hone jaruri hai
 There is a diverse classification scheme for different genomic changes, which can contribute to the production of cancer cells
 in main se adhikansh parivartan utparivartan hote hai, yaa jinomik DNA ke newcliotide anukraman main parivartan hote hai
 Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a genomic change that is not a mutation and may involve the gain or loss of one or more chromosomes by error in mitosis

 Small-scale mutations include point mutations, decreases or increases, which can occur in the promoter of a gene, affecting its expression
 yaa jin ke anukram koden main ho sakati he or iske protein utpaada ke sthayitv yaa kriya ko roopantarit kar sakati he
 Disruption of the sole gene can result in the integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retro virus, and this type of event can result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its progeny
 adhi-anuvaanshiki, DNA saranchana main rasinic, gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartanon ke madhyam se jin abhivyakti ke niyaman kaa adhyayan he
 The principle of over-genetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes in DNA cause changes in gene expression

 Many hormones can be made, a chemical messenger between cells that induces mitotic division, the effect of which depends on signal transduction of receptor tissue or cells
 duusare shabdon main, jab ek praptakarta koshika par ek hormone grahi uttejit hota he, sanket koshika kii sataha se koshika ke kendrak ko sanvahit hota he, yah kendriya str par jin pratilekhan viniman main kuch parivartanon ko prabhavit karata he
 Some oncogenes themselves are part of the signal transit mechanism, or part of the signal receptor in cells and tissues, thus controlling the sensitivity of such hormones
 onkosin aksar samasutrajan utpann karte hai, yaa protein sanshleshan main DNA ke pratilekhan main sanlagn hote hai, jo protein or anzime banaata he, ye protein or anzime un utpaadon or jaev rasayanon ke nirmaan ke liye uttaradaayi hai, jinke saath koshikaayen antarkriya karti hai or jinka koshikaayen upyog karti hai
 Mutations in proto-oncogenes, which are generally the stable equivalents of oncogenes, can modify their expression and action, and the products increase the action or amount of the protein
 jab aisa hota he, aadya-onchogin onchogin ban jate hai or yah sankraman koshika main koshika chakra viniman ke saamaanya santulan ko bigaad detaa he, jisase aniyantrit koshika vruddhi sambhav ho jaati he
 Even if possible, the possibility of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, as they are complex for the growth, repair and establishment of the organism
 aisa keval tab hota he jab ve utparivartit ho jate hai or vruddhi ke sanket atyadhik ho jate hai
 One of the first oncogenes to be defined in cancer research is the Ras oncogene
 Mutations in the Ras family of protein-oncogenes are very common, occurring in 20% to 30% of all human lumps

 Mutations of the genes that suppress the knot that occur in the germ level cells are transferred to the progeny and increase the likelihood of cancer in subsequent generations
 in pariwaron ke sadasyon ne aisi ghatnaon main vruddhi kii he or isse bahul tumor kii vilambtaa main kami ai he
 The type of knot is typical for each type of mutation that suppresses the knot, with some mutations causing specific types of cancer, while other mutations causing other types of cancer
 utparivarti tumor shaamak kii vanshagati kaa prakaar yah he ki ek prabhavi sadsy ek doshapurn pratilipi ko ek janak se or saamaanya pratilipi ko duusare janak se praapt karata he
 For example, a person who inherits a mutant p53 allele may develop melanoma and pancreatic cancer called li-fraumeni syndrome

 Finally, hereditary mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause early onset of breast cancer
 1971 main yah prastaav diya gaya ki cancer kaa vikaas kam se kam do utparivartan ghatnaon par nirbhar karata he
 According to Knudson's two-injury hypothesis, a hereditary gene level mutation in a gene that is quenching a gene will cause cancer only if another mutation occurs later in the organism's life, it is the gene that suppresses that knot
 Will inactivate other alleles
 aamtaur par, onkosin prabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan shaamil hota he, jabaki utparivartit tumor shaamak aprabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kii-haani utparivartan shaamil hota he
 Each cell has two copies of the same gene, each of which is obtained from the parent and in most cases an action-to-gain mutation in only one copy of a particular proto-oncogene, making that gene a true oncogene
 Is sufficient for duusari ore, kriya-kii-haani utparivartan kaa, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii donon pratilipiyon main hona aavashyak he taaki jin ko puri tarah se kriyaaheen banaaya ja sake
 However, there are cases in which a mutated copy of the knot-suppressing gene neutralizes the other wild-type copy
