 As a result of their emotional state, people often express a variety of expressions, such as crying, fighting or hating
 If someone expresses emotion without any related expression, then we can assume that expression is not required for feelings

 vishisht bhaawanaaon kaa ek anya arth unke hone vaale samay se sambandhit he
 Some emotions are of a few seconds, while some may last for many years

 Most theories are not isolated and many researchers have incorporated different perspectives into their work

 William James, in an article 'what is an emotion?', Argued that most emotional experiences are caused by physical changes
 lagbhag isi samay danish manovaigyanik karl laing ne bhi miltaa julata siddhant pesh kiya, isliye ise james-laing siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 According to this theory and its facts, a change of circumstance leads to physical change
 jaise ki james kehete hai "shaareerik badlaav hone kii avadharana hi bhaavana he "
 james daawa karte hai ki "hamen udaasi anubhav hoti hai kyonki ham rote hai, ladaai ke samay krodhit hote hai, kaanpane ke kaaran darate hai or aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki, maafi maangate hue, krodh yaa dar ke samay ham na royen, na laden yaa na kaanpen
 This theory has been proved by experiments, in which the desired emotion is obtained by changing the conditions of the body
 is prakaar ke prayogon ko chiktsa main bhi prayukt kiya gaya he 
 james-laing ke siddhant ko aksar galat samajha jaataa he kyonki yah virodhabhasi he
 Most people believe that emotions promote emotion-related actions: such as "i'm crying because I'm depressed", or "I ran because I'm scared"
 In contrast, james-lang's theory emphasizes that we first react according to the situation, and after that we relate our actions to emotional response
 is prakaar se, bhavanaaen hamaari apni kriyaaon kii vyakhya karti hai tathaa inhen vyavasthit karti hai
 james-lang's theory is now rejected by most students
 tim dalgleish ke nimnlikhit kathan ke anusaar: The james-lang theory has remained influential
 Its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity
 Most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified james-lang view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion
 " james-laing ke siddhant ke saath ek samasya yah he ki yah kriya ke parinaam par kendrit he, na ki bhaavnaatmak anubhavon se hone vaale shaareerik prabhaavon par
 
 From the information found in the mapping of the nerves of the brain structure, the neurobiological interpretation of human emotions is that emotion is a dear or unpleasant condition that arises in the breastmilk's brain
 yadi isaki sarisrupon se tulana kii jaye to bhaawanaaon kaa vikaas, saamaanya haddiyon vaale jantu kaa standhari ke rup main badalane ke samaan hoga, jinamein neurochemical main mastishk kii gatividhi ke str ke anusaar utaar-chadhaav aata he, jo ki sharir ke hilne dulne, manobhaavon tathaa mudraon main parilakshith hota he
 For example, the feeling of love is thought to be an expression of the palaeosurket of the mammalian brain, which leads to feelings of care, feeding, and beauty
 peleocircuit shaareerik bhaawanaaon ko tantrikaon dwaara pradarshit karne kaa madhyam he jo bolne ke liye bani cortical tantrika se lakhon varsh pehle bani thi
 In this, there is a network of nerve cells in the already formed pathway or the front of the brain, brain stem and spinal cord

 With the arrival of nocturnal mammals, about 180 million years ago, odor replaced vision as an effective nerve and created more avenues for responding through the snoring nerve, which is believed to be Later on, mammals evolved into feelings and emotional memory
 In the Jurassic period, mammals successfully used their sniffing ability compared to reptiles - that's why the part of the mammary olfactory nerve of mammals is larger than that of reptiles
 ye gandh dhire dhire tantrikaon kaa khaakaa banaati gayin jisase aage chal kar hamaare mastishk kii sanrachana bani
 Emotions are believed to be related to the functioning of the area of the brain that instructs us, motivates our behavior and explains the importance of the events around us
 broka, pepez or maclin kii mahatvapurn khojein bataati hai ki bhavanaaen mastishk ke madhya main sanrachanaon ke samooh se judi hoti he, jise limbik system kehete hai, jisame hypothalamas, singulate cortex, hippocampi or anya sanrachanaayen shaamil hai
 Recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures, unlike others, are not directly related to emotions in that way, while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater importance
 is baat ke paryaapt pramaan he ki baanyaa prifrantal cortex us uttejnaa se kriyasheel hota he jo sakaaratmak soch se utpann hoti he
 If the attractive stimulus is able to activate a selective part of the brain, then the logic must be completely reversed, that is, selective activation of that part of the brain must produce a stimulus in order to be judged more positively
 It was performed with provocative scenes featuring medium attraction, and was later expanded and repeated to include negative stimuli
 prifrantal cortex main neurobiological modelon ne bhaawanaaon ke do vipareet parinaam bataae
 valence model ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki gussa, jo ek nakaaratmak bhaavana he, daahine prifrantal cortex ko kriyasheel karegaa
 diarection model ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki gussa, ek drushtikon kii bhaavana he, atah baayein prifrantal ko kriyasheel karegaa
 duusare model ko samarthan mila
 However, there are still many questions that remain unanswered as to what is the better opposite definition of the approach in the prefrontal cortex, moving away, with no response, but strength and resistance or passive outcome without response
 Researches on shame and behavioral barriers have supported the action tendency model
 "homeostatic feelings" are the emotions generated by the internal state of the body, which organize our behavior
 pyaas, bhukh, garm yaa thanda anubhav karnaa, neend se vanchit mahasoos karnaa, namak khaane kii ichha tathaa hawa kii ichha, ye sabhi homeostatic bhaawanaaon ke udhaaharan hai; inamen se prayek shaareerik pranali dwaara diya gaya sanket he jo kahata he ki "sab kuch thik nahin he
 Drink / Eat / Get in the shade / Wear something warm / Sleep / Lick the salty piece / Breathe
 "when the balance of any of these systems is disturbed, we begin to experience the homeostatic feeling and this feeling gives us that, Which is necessary to maintain the balance of that system
 dard ek homeostatic bhaavana he jo hamen bataati he "sab kuch thik nahin he
 Step back and escape "
 kuch aise siddhant hai jo tark dete hai ki, sangyanatmak kriya - ek nirnay, moolyankan yaa vichaar - kisi bhaavana ko utpann karne ke liye aavashyak he
 According to Richard Laurus it is necessary to validate the fact that emotion arises about something or intentionally
 is prakaar kii sangyanatmak kriya chetan yaa avchetan ho sakati hai tathaa vaicharik prakriya kaa rup le sakati he yaa nahin le sakati he
 Here is an influential theory of Laurus: Emotion is an obstacle that arises in the following order: 1
) Cognitive appraisal — The person makes a rational assessment of the phenomenon that indicates emotion
 2
 shaareerik badlaav - sangyanatmak pratikriyaaon ke falswaroop jaivik badlaav hote hai, jaise, dil kii dhadkan kaa badhanaa yaa pituitary adrinil kii pratikriya
 3
 kriya - vyakti bhaavana ko anubhav karata he or pratikriya chunata he
 For example: Jenny sees a snake
 1
) jeni saanp ko dekhati he, jiske kaaran use dar lagata he 2
) uskaa dil jor se dhadkane lagata he
 Adrilene's blood flow is accelerated
 3
 jeni chillaati he or bhaag jaati he
 Laurus insists that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled by cognitive responses
 ye pratikriyaayein bachaav ranneeti banaati hai jo vyakti or uske vaataavaran ke badlaav ke anusaar bhaavnaatmak pratikriya banati he
 Some theories related to emotions argue that cognitive action in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts is necessary for emotion to occur
 ek pramukh darshanik vyaakhyaata rabart si
solomon hai 
 iskaa doosraa udhaaharan he, nico frijda dwaara prastaavit ek siddhant jiske anusaar moolyacan kii vajah se pravritiyaan ghatit hoti he
 It has also been suggested that emotions are commonly used as shortcuts for executing information and influencing behavior
 bhaawanaaon ke daihik or sangyanatmak siddhant kaa ek nayaa sankar siddhant avadharanatmak siddhant he
 This theory differs in the argument that bodily reactions are focused on emotions, however it emphasizes the significance of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something as found by cognitive theories
 is siddhant kaa nayaa daawa he ki is prakaar ke arth ke liye kalpana par aadhaarit sangyanaatmakataa anaavashyak he
 Rather, physical changes change themselves according to the meaningful content of emotions due to the change in the action due to some reason
 is sambandh main, bhavanaaen man kii shakti ke anuroop hoti hai, jaisi drushti yaa sparsh, jo vibhinn tareekon se hamen vastu tathaa duniya ke bich main sambandh sambandh ke bare main soochna pradaan karti he
 a sophisticated defense of this view was found in philosopher Jesse Prinz's book Gut Reactions and psychologist James Laird's book Feelings
 yah sanchaar aadhaarit harvard em
vaais tathaa rasel kropangeno, ke dwaara viksit siddhant he, jo bhaavnaatmak anubhavon ke kaarnon, sanrachnaao or parinaamon par dhyaan detaa he
 This theory suggests that emotions are influenced and occurred by events that affect attitudes and behavior as a result
 yah saidhantik dhaancha us samay par bhi jor detaa he jisame vyakti anubhav ko mahasoos karata he evam jise bhaavnaatmak prakaran kehete hai -"bhaavnaatmak sthitiyon kaa ek kram jo samay ke saath badhata he or ek mul vishay ke aasapaas vyavasthit hota he
 "this theory has been used by many researchers to better understand emotion through communication and is reviewed by Howard M
 Wise and Daniel J
 Beal in their articles Reflection on Affective Events Theory, which was published in 2005 on Research on Emotion in Published in Organizations
 canan board siddhant main, walter breadford canan bodyli changes in pen, hangar, fier and rej main bhaawanaaon ke shaareerik tathyon par james-laing ke prabhavi siddhant ke vipareet tark dete hai
 Where James argued that emotional behavior often escalated or interpreted emotion, Cannon and Byrd argued that emotion first arises and then specific behavior arises
 ek or sangyanatmak siddhant singer-shashter siddhant he
 This is based on the intentions of experiments which suggest that an injection of adrenalin may cause different emotional reactions of individuals despite being in the same mental state
 vyaktiyon kaa duusare vyakti kii sthiti ke anusaar vyakt kii gayi bhaavana ke anuroop gussa yaa prasannataa vyakt karte hue nirikshan kiya gaya
 Thus, the combination of status assessment and the participant taking adrenaline or placebo determined simultaneous responses
 This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Pinz's Gut Reactions
 sangyanatmak siddhant kaa ek tazaa sanskaran bhaawanaaon ko mote taur par kai vibhinn shaareerik or sangyanatmak ghatakon ke ek samay main hone vaali avasthaa bataata he

 The motivations of the creation of these war poems were the same events in the history of the Baloch caste that took place in that period; Such as the 30-year struggle of the Rind and lashari tribes, the vivid tale of the immortal love of Hani-shah Murid, Beberg and Giranaz and narratives, the antics of Shahdad and Mahnaz, the valor and courage of Shahdad and his followers in the Battle of Panipat because of Humayun's friendship , The war against Beberg Pusser for the singularity of Jusur and Ghayur Balach and other similar incidents gave rise to such high-quality war poetry

 vijayan malayalam bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar hai
 He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1990 for a novel written by him
 jab samudaay ke anek vyakti ek saath ek hi tarah ke uddeshy kii purti ke liye praytn karte hai to vah ek samuhik ghatana hoti he jise ‘janariti’ kehete hai
 This 'janriti' keeps on transferring from one generation to the other, thus it gets more and more of a group's appreciation while being transferred, because the successful experience of each generation makes it even stronger, this is the 'practice'
 kabhi-kabhi maanav in prathaon kaa paalan kanoonon ke samaan karata he
 Because he is afraid of society, he is afraid of publicity and he is afraid of social exclusion
 jaisaaki uparyukt vivechna se spasht hi he ki samaaj se manyata praapt, peedi-dar-peedi hastaantarit hone vaali suvyavasthit, drudh janaritiyaan hi ‘prathaen’ kehalaati hai
 The practice is actually an established and accepted method of social action
 log ise isliye maanate hai ki samaaj ke adhiktar log usee vidhi ke anusaar bahut dinon se kaary yaa vyavhaar karte aa rahe hai
 Thus, 'practice' is an adult form of 'janriti', with which social opinion or acceptance is associated
 ‘pratha’ kaa sambandh ek lambe samay se prayog main laai jane vaali lok-ritiyon se hota he
 In other words, it includes actions that have been accepted for generations
 inhen prathao ke kaaran ham naveen kriyaaon ko karne main kuch hichkichaahat kaa anubhv karte hai
 a person's behavior is influenced by practices
 maikiveror pejake anusaar, Prof
 Bogaardas, giving the definition of practices and traditions as one, has said, sepirane bhi likhaa he, But from the above definition of Prof
 Bogardus, it should not be understood that tradition and tradition are the same
 vastav main inamen paryaapt bhinnata he
 Explaining the difference between these two, Ross wrote that, he
 '' pratha kii prakruti ko spasht karne ke liye isaki visheshtaon ko jaananaa aavashyak he- The basis of 'custom' is society, but it is not made intentionally, but it develops during social interaction
 ‘pratha’ vah janariti he, jo peedi-dar-peedi hastaantarit hoti rahati he
 It is followed only because many people have been following it for a long time
 ‘pratha’ vyavhaar kii ve reetiyaan hai jo anek pidiyon se chalati aati hai or is prakaar samooh main sthayitv praapt kar leti hai
 There is more and more opinion of the group or society behind it
 vastav main anek pidiyon kaa safal anubhav hi ise drudh banaata he
 The 'practice' is conservative, so it cannot be changed easily and the pace of change is very slow
 ‘pratha’ ko banane, chalaane tathaa ise todane waalon ko dand dene ke liye koi sanghathan yaa shakti nahin hoti
 It is the society that gives birth and implements it
 maanav ke har prrkaar ke vyavhaar ko niyantrit karne kii kshamta, prathaon main bahut badi maatra main hoti he
 In human life, from childhood to death, they have an impact
 pratha kii prakruti ko spasht karne ke liye ginsburg ne ‘pratha’ or ‘aadat’ main antar karnaa aavashyak samajha he
 You wrote that, ginsburgke anusaar ‘pratha kii prakruti ko bhaleebhanti samajhane ke liye ‘pratha’ kaa ‘fishan’ se bhi antar samaj lenaa hoga
 It is sometimes said that fashion is an instantaneous analogy of a verb; That is, by its effect, every person does what every other man is doing; And thus it is based on simulation
 par ‘pratha’ to kriya kii kramik samanta he
 In other words, each person does what has always been done by working according to the practice and thus the practice is essentially based on habit
 lekin donon main isse kahin adhik mahatvapurn antar bhi he
 First of all, the practice seems to be related to the basic needs of the society, which always exists; While the influence of fashion is reflected in less poignant and less common areas of life
 fishan anivaary rup se gatisheel or parivartansheel hota he
 In fact, fashion is a series of recurring changes and is often characterized by imitation and innovation
 iske vipareet, pratha anivaary rup se susthir or bagaiyr toote chalane vaali hoti he
 And change in it always happens slowly
 isamen sandeh nahin ki kuch fishan aise bhi hote hai jo badalte nahin hai, lekin aisa hone par vastav main ve fishan nahin rahete, balki pratha ban jate hai
 In other words, they get the respect of both past and present
 duusari baat yah he ki pratha or fishan main prerak tatv pruthak-pruthak hote hai
 


 The practice follows that in the past, it has often been followed, whereas fashion is currently being followed
 iske atirikt, fishan ek tarah se naveenta kaa dyotak hota he or iskaa anivaary aadhaar apane ko duusare se pruthak karne kii utkar ichha main paaya jaataa he
 On the contrary, the emphasis of the practice is very much based on the fact that by this society can protect itself from the dangers of innovation
 arthath pratha kaa aadhaar apane ko dusron ke ateet ke or puraatan ke samaan kar lene kii ichha hoti he
 Generally, practices and public practices are considered the same
 parantu vastav main ye donon hi bhinn-bhinn vichaar hai
 Practices are actually their own developed forms rather than public pleasures
 samooh kaa koi bhi vyavhaar tab tak pratha kaa rup dhaaran nahin kar saktaa, jab tak ki use saamaajik sweekruti praapt na ho
 In this form, the generals can be called the first step of collective behavior and practices are the second step
 iske atirikt prathaen janaritiyon kii tulana main adhik sthaayee or shaktishaalee bhi hoti hai
 Not only this, as an instrument of social control, the importance of practices far exceeds that of the generals
 pratha kii utpatti ekaek yaa ek din main nahin hoti
 The development of any practice takes place slowly and over a period of time
 dainik jivan main manushya ke saamne anek naveen aavashyaktaayen aati rahati hai
 There are some of these which are related to most of the people of the group
 isliye is prakaar kii saamaanya aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke sadhano ko doundh nikaalane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 This instrument first comes to an individual's mind in the form of an idea or concept
 vyakti apane is vichaar ke anusaar kaary karata he or yah jaanane kii koshish karata he ki us tareeke se us aavashyaktaa kii purti ho sakati he yaa nahin
 If he is successful in this endeavor, then he repeats it again and again when the same need arises in future
 baar-baar dohraane se vah uski vyaktigat aadat ban jaati he
 When others see the first person's successful behavior or method of action; So they also adopt that method
 jab vyavhaar kii vah vidhi samaaj main fail jaati he to use janariti kehete hai
 When Janriti is transferred from one generation to another, it is called custom
 is prakaar ek vichaar se vyaktigat aadat, vyaktigat aadat se janariti or janariti se pratha kii utpatti yaa vikaas hota he
 Thus both past and present contribute to the origin of the practice
 vunt ne likhaa he, According to Mr
 Ginsberg this statement is true in the sense that custom is the creation of a composite creation and thousands of interactions
 lekin isse yah na samajhnaa chahie ki pratha ke peeche kisi mahamastishk yaa samaaj kii saamaanya aatma kaa astitv hota he
 In the end, the practice is born by mixing other personal habits with a personal habit
 unamem se prayek kii aadat kaa duusare se prabhavit hote rahane or duusare ko prabhavit karte rahane kaa hi fal he ki ant main ek sanyukt upaj ke rup main uskaa swaroop sthir ho jaataa he
 This is what we call custom
 jaisaaki hobahouse ne likhaa he- The importance of practice in social life cannot be denied in any way
 vastav main adikalin athwa saral samaajon main inkaa mahatv rajkeey kanoon se bhi adhik hota he
 There is a particular reason for this and that is that in simple societies the life of individuals is highly conservative, as well as highly influenced by religion
 atah ve pratha kaa ulanghan kisi bhi rup main nahin kar pate
 In addition, since the practice is passed on from generation to generation, its violation is considered an insult to the ancestors
 nimnlikhti vivechna se pratha kaa yah mahatv or bhi spasht ho jayega
 Fail and therefore social needs are not met by them
 aisi prathaen bahudhaa samaaj kii pragati main baadhak bhi ho jaati hai
 But we should not get confused by seeing the practice of some unhelpful practices that the practices are meaningless and meaningless
 prathaon kaa saamaajik niyantran main atyadhik mahatv he
 Practices control a person's behaviors to a great extent
 yadhyapi inke peeche aisi koi kanoonee shakti nahin hoti jiske dwaara vyaktiyon par unke manwaane ke liye dabaav daalaa ja sake, phir bhi manushya saamaajik ninda ke bhay se prathaon kaa ulanghan nahin kar paata
 Since the practices are successful experiences of previous generations, one quickly accepts them because he has a feeling of hesitation and fear in carrying out new practices
 prathaon kaa prabhaav aadim or saral samaajon main to kanoonon se bhi adhik hota he
 a special reason for this is that the lives of individuals in these types of societies are highly conservative, as well as more influenced by religion
 atah ve pratha kaa ulanghan kisi bhi rup main nahin kar pate
 Additionally, since the practices are passed down from generation to generation, their violation is considered an insult to the ancestors
 prathaon ke isi vyapak prabhaav ko de khate hue shakespeare ne prathaon ko ‘krur pratha’, monten ne ‘gussebaaj va dagaabaaz skool-masterni’, bekan ne ‘manushya ke jivan kaa pradhan nyaayadhish’ or lock ne ‘prakruti se bhi badi shakti’ kaha he
 Ginsberg wrote describing the role that practices play in social control, isiilie to prathaon ko saamaajik abhimati praapt hoti he or iske bal par hi ye vyakti ke vyavhaaron ko niyantrit va sanchalit karti hai or is prakaar saamaajik niyantran main sahaayak hoti hai
 The ancient society was small and simple and each person knew each other very personally
 saath hi, saamaajik jivan main na to parivartan shighrata se hota tha or na hi saamaajik samasyaayen gambheer thim
 Therefore, it was through practices that social control was easily done
 parantu aadhunik samaaj main prathaen bilkul aparyaapt hai or keval inke dwaara saamaajik niyantran aaj asambhav he
 There are four major reasons for this - is prakaar yah spasht he ki aadhunik samaaj ke liye prathaen aparyaapt hai or inke dwaara saamaajik niyantran kaa sampoorn kaary kadaapi nahin kiya ja saktaa he; yahi kaaran he ki aaj prathaon kaa mahatv din-pratidin ghatata ja rahaa he or kanoon kaa mahatv bad rahaa he
 Herat is a city in Afghanistan and Herat is also the capital of the province

 These instructions can be simple or complex
 aise adeshon ke kuch maanak nirdesh hote hai
 They are like this
 stop los kisi share yaa suchakank kaa vah mulya hota he, jis par pahunchane ke baad saude band kar diye jate hai
 In the financial market, there is also a possibility of the price of any share bought going up and there is a possibility of going down
 share kaa bhav yadi neeche girane lagata he to vah kaaphi neeche pahunch saktaa he
 Hence its stop loss is fixed only when purchasing shares
 udhaahrantah yadi sau rupe kaa share liya gaya he, to 95 yaa 90 rupe aane par bech diya jaae
 What price to keep, or sell, even when the price reaches below it; This is the stop loss
 anubhaviyon ke anusaar share kharidte samay hi stop los ke bare main tay kar lenaa adhik laabhprad rahata he
 This facility is available in the broker's computer
 safal evam anbhavi stock niveshak ritern kaa anumaan or stop los par sadaa hi griddha-drushti banaaye rakhte hai
 Stop loss is also called stop order
 kisi share ke badhate hue bhav ke aankadon kii sarini main jis sthaan par share-bhav trend line ko kaat kar neeche kii ore jaae, vahiin us share kaa stoplos hota he
 Similarly, where the price in recession deals cuts above the trend line, there is a stop loss of those deals
 jab stoplos ko bhav ke saath badhaayaa yaa ghataya jaataa he, to use trailing stoplos kehete hai
 There are several types: bazaar main chadhate hue share ke bhav kaa graph jahaan se neeche kii ore mudata he, us sthiti yaa sthaan ko top yaa sheersh kehete hai
 Similarly, from where the graph starts climbing in the falling house, it is called bottom
 takneekee vishleshan main top or bottm kaa bada mahatv hota he
 If every next top and bottom in a chart is higher than the previous top and bottom respectively, then the stock or index is said to be in a boom phase
 isi tarah kisi chart main har aglaa top or bottm kramash: pichley top or bottm se neeche ho, to share yaa suchakank mandi ke daur main mana jaataa he
 In the bar chart of the stock price, the line which is found when a stock is connected to the highest and lowest prices of each day on a straight line is called the trend line or trend line
 girte hue share kii trend line us share ke ucchtam bhav se line khinchate hai, jabaki chadhate hue share kii trend line khinchne ke liye nunatam bhav se line khinchi jaati he
 For better results, the line is drawn from the density areas of the highest or lowest prices of several days in place of the highest or lowest price of a single day
 vyapaar rekha niveshkon ke liye atyant sahaayak hoti he, jise angreji main trend ij da best friend bhi kehete hai
 a breakdown of the trend means that the direction of the stock move is about to change
 yani agar share bhav gir rahaa ho or ekaek share kii keemten upar se khinchi gai rujhaan rekha ko katkar upar kii ore aane lagen, to samajhnaa chahie ki badhat shuru hone vaali he
 Conversely, if the trend line drawn from the rising stock or the lower price of the index starts going above the prices, then the fast deals should be cut
 ritern par nazar rakhane or milane vaale kaa anumaan lagane se niveshak ko vittiya lakshyon kii jaankaree milane par laabh-vasuuli saral ho jaati he
 This makes the decision easier whether the investor is profitable to invest in a particular business
 visheshgyon ke anusaar yadi ritern - jokhim anupaat paksh main nahin he to vah kaarobaar nahin karnaa chaiye
 For example, if you buy a stock of Rs 90 with a target of Rs 100 and the stop loss is below Rs 75, then the return-risk ratio is not in favor
 is maamle main lakshya keemat par share bechney ke baad 10 rupye prati share ke pratyaashit laabh ke liye 15 rupye prati share kii haani nuksaan uthaane ko taiyaar hai
 This way the risk is higher than the returns and it is prudent not to invest in this stock
 is prakaar stop losd kii jaankaree nivesh karnaa tay karne main atyant sahaayak hoti he
 Most analysts feel that traders should fix a stop loss based on their risk appetite

 Before he began putting his ideas together, he talked with Damon Lindelof, executive producer of LAST, with whom he had worked at the crossing for three years
 Kring thanks Lindelof for his measures in which he explained how to perform the series on the network and gave feedback on the experiences he had learned while working on the series drama
 The two still negotiate and assist each other's projects
 When Kring told the NBC network about Heroes' plan, he described the network's response as "exciting 


 very good
" He says that he has been a partner with NBC for some time based on running Crossing Jordan as a show-runner for six years
 When he narrated the plan, he described everything in depth, including the mysterious ending
 When the NBC officer asked them what was going to happen next, Kring replied "you just wait and find out
" After the project was approved, a special 73-minute version of the first episode was screened in front of a large audience at the 2006 Comic Con in San Diego
 Initially it was stated that this non-proliferated pilot would not be released, yet it was included in the DVD set of the first season

 When the writing team works on an episode, each writer takes a character and writes the lone scenes around it
 These stories are then added and the episodes are given to the writer
 The system allows each writer to contribute to each episode and enables the writing team to finish the script early so that shooting crews can shoot more scenes at one location
 Tim Kring considers the writing process to be collaborative and says that the collaboration process is important because the production has to shoot multiple scenes in one place
 To do this, several scripts must be prepared
 Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explains that this process is important in a series drama because it is important to know in which direction each character is moving

 In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, producer Tim Kring commented on criticisms from the two seasons and a 15% drop in the series' ratings
 Kring said he made mistakes directing season two
 He thought audiences were looking to "develop the characters and discover their powers", as opposed to season one, when viewers were looking for "thrills"
 Kring also stated that he had problems with the development of the story, stating that the second season "took too much time to become a big story", describing that Peter's hypothesis of a final battle from the viral in the first episode rather than the seventh Should have been He believes that in the context of the main story, it would have been better to bring new characters, such as Eli, instead of a separate story of Maya and Alejandro
 Kring also admitted that he was called "heroes in Japan" The story should have ended more quickly and also that the romantic stories are not going well
 With reference to Claire and West and Heroes and Yeko, he said, "I have seen more believable romance on TV
 In that context, i don't think romance is a natural fit for us

 In November 2008, NBC fired Jesse Alexander and Jeff Loeb from the production staff at Heroes due to creative differences and budget problems
 As a result, Tim Kring had to refocus on the development of the characters and the simple story series
 However, a high-level insider told TV Guide that the recent sting ratings, rather than pressure from NBC or Universal Media, have resulted in Alexander and Loeb being fired as the duo made the first season popular
 Character-based stories were refused to continue

 There are many mysterious fictional events in Heroes which have been proved based on science fiction or supernatural events
 Tim Kring and the creators of the series see these fictional elements as part of the mythology of the series
 Kring confirmed that although the show is mythically the only one of its kind, he does not want to go too deep into it
 Rather, instead of prolonging the story as it did in Lost, Kring used parts to finish the story, as far as the overall mythology of the series is concerned, Kring said, "we talked about it Talked about where the show will reach by the fifth season
 " Regarding the show's closing date, Kring commented that, "the show has not yet been thought of ending

 " Barry Garren of The Hollywood Reporter also stated, "heroes is one of tv's most imaginative creations and, with luck, could become this year's Lost
" Less favorable reviews also include the Philadelphia Inquirer's comment that although the show had many "good effects", it had "nothing but a pile of blatant nonsense and tardy dialogue
" After the season one episode ended, the Chicago Tribune even went on to say, "you can watch the first few episodes of Heroes, or you can blow your forehead on the wall

 Emerson claimed that the scene "shows the dispose in a bad light, causing the product to deteriorate without being repairable" and suggested "if consumers accidentally put their hands in it, there is a possibility of serious injuries as a result
" Emerson demanded a ban on future transmissions of the pilot, Which was already available on the NBC website and had already aired on USA Network and The Sci Fi Channel, owned by NBC Universal's cable network
 It also demanded a ban on NBC not to use any Emerson trademarks in the future

 This unit comments on parents who are unable to pay attention to their children because of their work
 aajkal ke mahangaai ke kaaran pati-patni donon ko kaam karnaa padataa he lekin bachche is baat ko samaj nahin pate hai
 They feel that the parents do not love them and they start protesting, thinking about running away from home and sometimes even doing harmful work, but this is not true
 is ekanki main do bachche neeru or manuj he jo apane mata-pita se shikaayat karte he ki unhen yah ghar ghar nahin lagata or vah usamen akele rahakar dabaa-dabaa mahasoos karte hai
 Neeru tells her father that "ghar is a Thai" which means that a person should be happy by entering the same type of house in which the players are very happy by winning the game
 Deserve to be called
 manuj ko yah bhi laga ki uske mata-pita uske janm-din tak bhul gayi the lekin uske mata ne use pulover or pita ne use ghadi dekar yah baat galat sabit kar diya or yah kaha ki ve unase bahut pyaar karte he or naukari to unki majaburi he
 Parents are also responsible to some extent for this state of mind of children, because due to lack of time, they are unable to give proper guidance to their children
 isaliye mata-pita ko hameshaa kuch samay bacchon ke saath bitaana chahie
 One should always try to keep the atmosphere inside the house good

 aisa mana jaataa he ki iske andar bhagwaan kii shaktiyaan traahi machaati hai yah nrity shiv kaali jaise dev karti hai shiv kii teesri aankh ke khulne se haahaakaar ho jaataa he
 Tandava has many meanings in Sanskrit
 iske pramukh arth hai uddhat nrity karnaa, ugr karm karnaa, svachhnd hastkshep karnaa aadi
 In Indian music, there is also a description of the Tandavya rhythm composed of a mixture of Veer and Bibhatsa Ras in fourteen major rhythms
 vanaspati shaastra main ek prakaar kii ghaas ko bhi tandav kaha gaya he
 In the scriptures, Lord Shiva is said to be the originator of the Tandava form
 parantu anya aagam tathaa kavy granthon main durga, ganesh, bhairav, shriram aadi ke tandav kaa bhi varnan miltaa he
 In addition to Lankesh Ravana Vriticha Shiva Tandava Stotra, Ram Tandava Stotra is also received in Durga Tandava, Ganesh Tandava, Bhairava Tandava and Sri Bhagavatananda Guru Sri Sri Raghavendracharitam composed by Vaishyavar Samadhi
 manyata he ki ravan ke bhawan main pujan ke samaapt hone par shiv ji ne, mahisasur ko maarane ke baad durga mata ne, gajamukh kii paraajay ke baad ganesh ji ne, brahma ke pancham mastak ke chhedan ke baad adibhairav ne evam ravan ke vadh ke samay shriramchandra ji ne tandav kiya tha

 boudhayan dharmasutra, aapstamb dharmasutra or vaasishth dharmasutron main harit ko baar–baar uddhat kiya gaya he
 Most of Harit's quotes are found in the Apastamb Dharmasutra
 tantravarthik* main harit kaa ullekh gautam, vashishtha, shankh or likhit ke saath he
 Subsequent theologians have reiterated the quotes of Harit, but the handwriting of Harit Dharmasutra available and whose form is 30 chapters is not found in many of these quotations
 dharamshastreey nibandhon main uplabdh harit ke vachanon se gyaat hota he ki unhone dharmasutron main varnit praayah sabhi vishyon par apane vichaar prakat kiye the
 According to Manusmriti's interpreter Kulluk Bhatt, the initial part of Harit Dharmasutra was as follows - nasik janapad ke ismalpur naamak sthaan par harit dharmasutra kaa ek hastlekh vamanshastri ko mila tha jisamen 30 adhyay hai
 It is very corrupt and it does not even get a quotation, therefore, the Kane Prabhriti mystics have expressed doubt on its authenticity
 harit dharmasutra main nirupit vishyon main mukhya he– Original Source of Religion, Upkurvaष्ठa and Na संज्ञ संज्ञika Cognizant Dwivedi Brahmachari, Graduate, Grihastha, Aranyaka Sanyasi, Bhaksya-bhakti, Birth and death-ashoka, Shraddha, Sacred Practices, Panchamahayagya, Vedadhyayana and Anadhyaya, Rajkarma, Governance, Law, Judicial Practices, Duties of women, atonement etc
 harit ne ashtavidh vivaahon main 'kshaatr' or 'maanush'– ye donon naam aise die gaye hai, jo anyatra nahin milte
 There is no mention of joy and prajapatya under Ashtavidha marriages
 brahmavadini striyon ko vedadhyayan kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 Abhinaya-vrithi has been seen as a matter of hatred, and the colored Brahmin has been prohibited from performing deeds and shraadh

 jeevanand ke dwaara sampadit dharamshastra sangrah main harit dharamshastra ko 'laghu harit smriti' or 'vruddh harit smriti' – in do roopon main prakashit kiya gaya he
 The miniature Harit Smriti has seven chapters and 250 verses
 vruddh harit smriti main aath adhyay or 2600 padya hai
 The influence of Vaishnavism on this is obvious

 Nusrat Fatah Ali Khan was a famous qawwal of the Sufi style
 inke gayan ne qawwali ko pakistan se aage badhkar antarrashtriya str par pahchaan dilaai
 Born in Faisalabad, Punjab on 13 October 1948 in the house of Qawwals, Nusrat Fatah Ali Khan, his father Ustad Fatah Ali Khan Sahab, himself a very famous and Marruf Qawwal, had prevented his son from coming to the area and for 600 years of the family He wanted to break the ongoing tradition, but God accepted something else, it seemed as if God had bestowed 600 years of kindness on this family, the father had to agree Voice Usrt that gave the Lord's gift and she then could not stop Nusrat and today history is in front of us

 i can say with a claim that when Nusrat Sahab is singing, God will also live somewhere around there, listening to them drunkenly
 Blessed are those people who will be present there at that time
 His voice - his style, his shaking of hands, seriousness on face, excellent use of music, all these represent the representation of spirituality

 Tidal force is the force that an object exerts from its gravity at different places at different places on another object
 prithvi par samudr main jowar-bhaata ke utaar-chadhaav kaa yahi kaaran he
 "tidal force" is called "tidal force" in English
 jab chandramaa prithvi par apane gurutvkarshan kaa prabhaav daalata he to jo uske sabase sameep kaa samudr he, uskaa pani chandramaa kii ore uthta he
 This brings tide in that area
 prithvi ke daayen or baayein taraf kaa pani bhi khichakar saamne kii ore jaataa he, jis se un ilaaqon main bhaata aata he 
 The water behind the earth is far away from the moon and feels less drained, which also keeps the tide there
 chandramaa ke jowarbhata bal kaa asar pani tak simit nahin
 It also affects the earth's land
 agar puraa asar dekha jaae to jowarbhata bal se prithvi kaa gola thodaa pichak sa jaataa he
 In astronomy there is a Roche Limit law
 isamen yadi koi vastu kisi grah kii rosh seemaa ke andar aa jaye to vah grah usapar aisa jowarbhata bal daalata he ke vah vastu pichak kar tut sakati he
 The satellite rings of Saturn, the sixth planet of our solar system, are made in a similar way
 saadhaaran taur par agar kisi grah ke ird-gird malba parikrama kar rahaa ho to vah samay ke saath-saath judakar upgrah ban jaataa he
 But if it is within the range, then the pitch of the tidal force does not allow it to join
 agar koi bana-banaaya upgrah yaa dhoomaketu bhi rosh seemaa ke andar bhatak jaae to todaa ja saktaa he
 When the comet named shumaker-lavi collided with Jupiter in 1992, Jupiter's fierce tidal force broke it

 khel siddhant kootnithik paristhitiyon main vyavhaar ko boojhne kaa prayaas karata he
 While it was initially developed to understand competitions in which one person benefits from the other's mistakes, it has been extended to many situations where different actions have an impact on each other
 Ho
 aaj, "game theory" samaaj vigyaan ke taarkik paksh ke liye ek chhatari yaa 'uniphoid field' theory kii tarah he jisamen 'saamaajik' kii vyakhya maanav ke saath-saath duusare khilaadiyon ko sammilit kar kii jaati he
 Traditional applications of game theory attempt to find similarities in these games
 samyavastha main game kaa prayek khilaadi ek niti apanaataa he jo vah sambhawatah nahin badalata he
 Many concepts of equilibrium have been developed to understand this idea
 samyavastha ke in avadharanaon kii abhiprerana alag-alag hoti he or is baat par nirbhar karti he ki ve kis kshetra main prayog kii ja raheen hai, haalaanki unke myne kuch had tak ek duusare main mili-jule hote hai or mail khate hai
 This method is not critical and debates continue over the suitability of particular concepts of equilibrium, the appropriateness of societies, and generally the utility of mathematical models
 haalaanki iske pehle hi is kshetra main kuch vikaas chuke the, game theory kaa kshetra jon won neumann or auskar morganstern kii 1944 kii pustak theory of games and iconomik biheviar ke saath aastitiv main aayaa
 This theory was largely developed by many scholars in the 1950s
 baad main game theory spashtatya 1970 ke dashak main jeev vigyaan main prayukt kiya gaya, haalaanki aisa 1930 ke dashak main hi shuru ho chukaa tha
 Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields
 aath game theorists arthshaastra main nobel puraskaar jeet chuke hai or jon menard smith ko game theory ke jeev vigyaan main prayog ke liye krafurd puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Games observed in game theory are clearly defined mathematical 'objects'
 ek game khilaadiyon ke ek set, khilaadiyon ke paas uplabdh chaalon ke ek set or nitiyon ke prayek sangyojan ke laabh ke nirdhaaran se bana hota he
 Most 'cooperative games' are represented in special function forms, while the Extensive and Normal forms are used to define nonoperative games
 ekstensive form kaa prayog kuch mahatvapurn anukram vaale gemon ko 'formalaise' karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Games in this are often represented as 'trees', with each vertex indicating a point of choice for a player
 khilaadi 'vartex' dwaara soochibaddh ek sankhya dwaara nirdisht kiya jaataa he
 The lines that exit the vertex represent a possible action of that player
 laabh tree ke nichle hisse main nirdisht kiye jate hai
 The game depicted here featured two players
 khilaadi 1 pehle chaal chalata he or yaa to f yaa u chunata he
 Player 2 sees the move of player 1 and then chooses either a or R
 maane ki khilaadi 1 u chunata he or phir khilaadi 2 a chunata he, tab khilaadi 1, 8 paata he or khilaadi 2, paata he 
 Extensive form, games in which both moves do not go together and games in which information is not confirmed, can also explain these two types of games
 ise nirupit karne ke liye vibhinn vartexon ko- unhen ek hi soochna set kaa hissaa dikhaane ke liye - yaa to ek bindidaar rekha se joda jaataa he, yaa unke darmyaan ek band rekha khinchi jaati he
 Normal is usually represented by a matrix in which players, moves and gains are marked
 aam taur par yah kisi aise function ke dwaara nirupit kiya ja saktaa he jo prayek khilaadi ke chaalon ke sabhi sanyojanon ke laabh se sambaddh rahata he
 The accompanying example has two players; Selects one row and the other column
 Each player has two strategies specified by the number of rows and columns
 laabh andar main die gaye hai
 The first number is the gain received by the player with the cry; The second number is the profit received by the player with the column
 maane ki agar khilaadi 1 upar chalata he khilaadi 2 baayen chalata he
 Then player 1 gains 4 and player 2 gains 3
 jab ek khel narmal form main prastut kiya jaataa he, yah mana jaataa he ki prayek khilaadi ek saath chaal chalate hai yaa kam se kam duusare ke chaalon se anbhigya hote hai
 If players have any idea of each other's choices, the game is usually presented in extensible form
 hastantaraneey upyogita vaale 'kooparative' gemon main koi bhi swatantra alag laabh nahin die rahete hai
 Instead, the characteristic function determines the gain for each alliance
 maanak dharna yah he ki khaali gathbandhan ko 0 laabh praapt hota he
 The earliest source of this form comes from the foundational book of von Neumann and Morgenstern
 unhone coalishnal normal form gemon kaa adhyayan karte samay yah mana ki jab ek gathbandhan c { \ displaystyle C} c banataa he, yah sampoorak gathbandhan ke viruddh kheltaa he jaise ki wo 2 khilaadiyon vaala game khel rahe hon
 The equilibrium gain of c { \ displaystyle C} c is characteristic
 ab normal form gemon se coalishnal maan nikaalane ke liye vibhinn model hai, par kairactaristic form ke saare game normal form gemon se vyuttpann nahin kiye ja sakate
 As a rule, a characteristic function form game is represented as a pair { \ displaystyle} where n { \ displaystyle N} expresses a set of players and v: 2 n ⟶ r { \ displaystyle v: 2 ^ { N} \ longrightarrow \ mathbb {R}} is a characteristic function
 kairactaristic function form bina hastantaraneey upyogita ke anumargan vaale gemon main samanyikrut kiya gaya he
 The characteristic function form ignores possible 'externalities' of the formation of 'coalescence'
 partishan function form main 'coalishan' kaa laabh sirf iske sadasyon par hi nirbhar nahin karata balki is par bhi nirbhar karata he ki baaki khilaadi kis rup main vibhajit hai
 Game theory has been used in a detailed study of the diverse behaviors of humans and animals
 shuru main yah arthshaastra main aarthik vyavhaar ke ek bade sangrah ko samajhane ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha, jinamein companiyon, bazaaron or upbhogem theory ke vyavhaar shaamil hai
 The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded further, and game theory has also been used in the study of political, social and psychological behaviors
 game theory aadhaarit vishleshan kaa upyog shuru main 1930 ke dashak main ronaald fisher ne pashuon ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karne ke liye kiya tha 
 This work dates back to the existence of the name "game theory", but many of the features of it and game theory are similar
 arthshaastra main hue iske vikaas kaa baad main jeev vigyaan main prayogjon menard smith ne apni pustak evolution and da theory of games main kiya
 In addition to predicting and explaining behavior, game theory has also been used to attempt to develop theories of moral or normative behavior
 arthshaastra or darshanashastra main, vidwaanon ne game theory ko achche yaa uchit vyavhaar ko samajhane main bhi prayukt kiya he
 If we go back, we can see that Plato also presented this kind of connotation based on game theory
 raajnneeti vigyaan main game theory kaa prayog nishpaksh vibhaajan, ]]] ke ativyapee kshetron par kendrit he
 In each of these areas, researchers have developed game theory-based models in which players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians
 raajnneeti vigyaan main prayukt game theory ke aarambhik udaahranon ke liye anthony douns kaa kaary dekhen
 In his book An Economic Theory of Democracies: Harvard citations / core, he used the 'hoteling firm location model' in the political system
 downsian model main, raajnneetik ummidavaar siddhanton ke prati ek aiami niti 'spes' main patibaddh hote hai
 Theorists demonstrate how political candidates will converge towards the preferred ideology of average voters
 bilkul tazaa udaahranon ke liye steven brams, jorge tsebelis, jin em
 grosman or elhanan helpman kii yaa david austen-smith or jeffri es
 banks kii pustaken dekhen
 a game-theoretic explanation of democratic peace is that the public and free debate of democracy transmit clear and reliable information concerning their intentions to other states
 iske vipareet, gaiyr-loktantric netaaon ke iraadon kaa pataa lagaana kathin he ki koun-koun si riyaayaten lagu hongi or kya vaadon ko puraa kiya jayega
 Thus there will be mistrust and reluctance to grant concessions if at least one of the parties in question is a non-democratic mold: Harvard citations / core
 arthshaastri bahut lambey samay se game theory kaa prayog nilaamiyon, mol-bhav, dwayadhikaron, nyaaypurna vibhaajan, alpaadhikaron, saamaajik network ke nirmaan or matdaan tantron sahit aarthik tathyon kii vyapak shreniyon ke vishaleshan ke liye karte rahe hai
 This research usually focuses on specific sets of strategies, called balance in sports
 ye “samaadhaan avadharanayen” saamanytah taarkikta ke niyamon kii aavashyaktaaon par aadhaarit hoti hai
 Among non-cooperative games, Nash equilibrium is the most famous of these
 ranneetiyon kaa ek samucchy yadi anya ranneetiyon ke prati sarvshereshth pratikriya kaa pratinidhitiv karata ho, to vah naish santulan he
 So if all players are making their moves in Nash equilibrium, there will be no unilateral temptation to move away from the path between them, since their strategy is the best, so they can do what the other players are doing
 khilaadiyon kii vyaktigem theory upyogita kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye saamanytah khel ke munaafe ko liya jaataa he
 In ideal situations, profits often represent wealth, possibly related to a person's utility
 haalaanki yah dharna trutipurna ho sakati he
 a paradigmatic paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abbreviation for a specific economic situation
 ek yaa ek se adhik samaadhaan avadharanayen chuni jaati hai or lekhak yah pradarshit karata he ki prastut khel main ranneeti ke koun-se samucchy upyukt prakaar ke santulan main hai
 Naturally, we may wonder what to use this information for
 arthshaastri or vyapaarik professor do praathmik upyogon kaa suzav dete hai: varnanaatmak or aadeshaatmak
 The first known use is to describe how the human population behaves
 kuch vidwaan maanate hai ki khelon ke santulanon kii khoj kar lene par ve is baat kaa purvanumaan kar sakate hai ki jis khel kaa adhyayan kiya ja rahaa he, usamen varnit sthitiyon jaisi sthitiyon se saamana hone par vaastavik maanav aabaadi kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karegi
 This specific approach to game theory is facing the latest criticism
 sabase pehle, isaki aalochana is baat ko lekar kii jaati he ki game theorycaron dwaara banaai gai dharanaon kaa aksar ulanghan hota he
 Game theorists may assume that players always work in the same way to directly increase their victories to the maximum level, but in practice, human nature often differs from this model
 is tathy kii anek vyakhyaayen hai: tarkheenata, vivechna ke naye model, yaa yahan tak ki vibhinn prerak 
 In response, game theorists compare their assumptions with those used in physics
 is prakaar haalaanki unki dharanayen sadaiv sahi sabit nahin hotin, lekin ve game theory ko bhautik-shastriyon dwaara prayukt pratimaanon ke samaan vaigyanik adarsh ke rup main prayog kar sakate hai
 However, some additional criticism is also leveled at the use of this game theory as some studies have demonstrated that individuals do not use balance strategies
 udhaaharan ke liye shatpad khel main, ek ausat khel kaa 2 / 3 bhaag anumaan par aadhaarit hota he or taanashaah khel main log niyamit rup se naish santulanon ke dwaara nahin khelte
 The debate over the importance of these studies continues
 vaikalpik rup se, kuch lekhak daawa karte hai ki naish santulan maanav aabaadiyon ke liye purvanumaan nahin pradaan karte, balki ve is baat kii vyakhya karte hai ki naish santulanon se khilne vaali aabaadiyaan us avasthaa main hi kyon bani rahati hai
 However, the question remains open how populations reach that point
 apni chintaaon ke samaadhaan ke liye kuch siddhantkaar vikasvaadi game theory kii ore mud gayi hai
 These paradigms either assume no rationality for players or assume restricted rationality
 apane naam ke baavjood vikasvaadi game theory aavashyak rup se jaivik arth main prakritik chayan ko nahin maanata
 Evolutionary game theory encompasses both biological as well as cultural development and the paradigm of individual game theory education
 duusari ore, kuch vidwaan game theory ko manushyon ke vyavhaar ke liye ek bhavishyasuchak upkaran ke rup main nahin, balki is baat ke ek suzav ke rup main dekhte hai ki logon ko kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karnaa chaiye
 Since a Nash equilibrium of a game produces the individual's best response to other players' game theory methods, it seems appropriate to play a trick that is part of the Nash equilibrium
 haalaanki, game theory ke liye yah prayog bhi aalochana ke antargem theory aa gaya he
 First, in some cases it is appropriate to use a non-equilibrium strategy when the individual is expected to use a non-equilibrium strategy by other players as well
 ek udhaaharan ke liye, ausat kaa 2 / 3 anumaan dekhen
 Second, the prisoner's dilemma presents another possible counter-example
 kaidi kaa asamanjas main, apane swaarth kii purti kaa prayaas karte hue prayek khilaadi donon khilaadiyon ko usase buree sthiti main le aata he, jisamen ve apane swaarth kii purti kaa prayaas na karne par rahe hote
 In contrast to economics, the benefits for sports in biology are often explained in terms of merit
 iske atirikt taarkikta ke vichaar se sambandhit santulanon par kam or vikasvaadi shaktiyon dwaara banaaye rakhe ja sakane vaale santulanon par zyaada dhyaan kendrit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The best equilibrium known in biology is known as the evolutionary static strategy and was first presented in
 haalaanki isaki praarambhik prerana main naish santulan kii koi bhi maansik aavashyaktaa shaamil nahin thi, lekin prayek ESS ek naish santulan hota he
 Game theory has been used to understand many different facts in biology
 sabase pehle iskaa upyog 1:1 ling anupaat kii utpatti kii vyakhya karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Suggested that the 1: 1 sex ratio is the result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who can be seen as attempting to increase the number of their grandchildren to the maximum level
 iske atirikt, jeev-vigyaniyon ne vikasvaadi game theory or ESS kaa upyog pashuon ke bich sampreshan ke aavirbhaav kii vyakhya karne ke liye kiya he
 Analysis of signaling games and other communication games has provided some information about the origin of communication between animals
 udhaaharan ke liye, pashuon kii anek prajatiyon, jinamein shikari jaanwaron kii ek badi sankhya kisi bade parabhakshi par hamalaa karti he, main samuhik akraman kaa vyavhaar sahaj rup se utpann sanghathan kaa ek udhaaharan prathit hota he
 Biologists have used the game of chicks to analyze territoriality and fighting behavior
 khelon kii utpatti or siddhant kii prastaavna main menard smith likhte hai, “rodhabhasi rup se, yah paaya gaya he ki game theory arthshaastreey vyavhaar ke kshetra, jiske liye vah mul rup se banaaya gaya tha, kii bajaay jeevigyaan par zyaada acchhee tarah lagu hota he”
 Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many of the facts that seem to be Asangem Theory in nature
 aise hi ek tathy ko jaivik paropkaarita kehete hai
 This is a situation in which an organism appears to be acting in such a manner, which is beneficial to other organisms and detrimental to itself
 yah paropkaarita kii paaramparik dharna se bhinn he, kyonki aise kaary sachetan nahin hote, balki sakal yogyata ko badhaane ke liye vikasvaadi anukulan ke rup main dikhaai dete hai
 Examples of this include vampire bats, who spew blood from night prey and pass it on to members of their group who have failed to hunt, from worker bees, who serve the lifelong queen bee, and sometimes Do not mingle, ranging from vervet monkeys, who warn group members about the hunter's arrival, even if it threatens their own lives Are
 inamen se sabhi kaary ek samooh kii sakal yogyata ko badhaate hai, lekin aisa karne ke liye ek jeev ko apni jaan ganvaani padati he
 Evolutionary game theory describes this altruism as the idea of relative selection
 paropkaaree jeev un praaniyon ke bich bhed-bhav karte hai, jinaki ve sahaayta karte hai or ve apane sambandhiyon kaa paksh lete hai
 Hamilton's law explains the evolutionary logic behind this selection by the formula c <b * r, where the logistic theory applied to a philanthropist must be less than the product of the coefficient of profit and affiliation
 do jeevon ke bich nikatataa jitani adhik hogi, paropkaarita kii ghatnayen bhi utani hi bad jaaengi kyonki unke anek genetic tatv samaan honge
 This means that the philanthropic organism may abandon the option of giving birth to one's own offspring, ensuring that the genetic elements of its close relatives are transmitted further
 
 udaahranarth, kisi sahodar kii sahaayta karne kaa gunank 1 / 2 hota he kyonki jeev apane sahodar kii santan main 1 / 2 genetic tatv saajha karata he
 Ensuring that a substantial number of siblings survive to adulthood eliminates the need for a philanthropist to produce his or her own

 Similarly, if it is considered that any information other than genetic information remains with time, then the playing field becomes bigger and the discrimination becomes smaller

 Many logical theories have their basis in game economics
 iske atirikt, computer vaigyanikon ne anek antahkriyaatmak gananaaon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye khelon kaa prayog kiya he
 Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis in the field of multi-agent mechanisms
 pruthak rup se, game theory ne online elgorithm main bhi bhoomika nibhaai he
 Typically, the k-server problem, which in the past was referred to as mobile games and request-response games
 saanchaa:harvard citations / core yaao kaa siddhant yadruchhikrut elgorithm or visheshtah online elgorithm, kii gananaatmak jatilta kii nichali simaaon ko siddh karne ke liye ek khel-saidhantik takanic he
 The field of algorithmic game theory combines computer science concepts of complexity and algorithm design with game theory and economic theory

 Game theory has many uses in philosophy
 saanchaa:harvard citations / core dwaara prastut do shodh-patron par pratikriya dete hue, Lewis ne sammelan kii ek darshanik samaj viksit karne ke liye game theory kaa prayog kiya
 In doing so, he provided a preliminary analysis of general knowledge and used it to analyze sports in synergy sports
 iske atirikt, pehle unhone yah suzav diya ki vyakti arth ko sanket khelon ke sandarbh main samaj saktaa he
 This suggestion has been used by many philosophers after Lewis, (harvard citations / core)
 Following the game-theoretic Lewis of conventions, Ullmann Margellit and Bicherry have developed theories of social rules that form the Nash equilibria that result from converting a mixed-purpose game into a synergy game
 Let's define
 game theory darshanikon ko antahkriyaatmak gyanamimasaa ke sambandh main sochane kii chunauti bhi detaa he: kisi samooh ke liye samaan vishwaason yaa gyaan kaa kya arth hota he or abhikartaaon kii antahkriya ke kaaran milanevaale saamaajik parinaamon par is gyaan kaa kya prabhaav padataa hai
 Philosophers working in this field include Bicherry, Skirmes, and Stalnaker

 Some of the predictions used in parts of game theory have been challenged in philosophy; Psychological egoism states that rationality reduces self-interest — a claim that is a matter of debate for philosophers
 ek khel sahakaari hota he, yadi khilaadi bandhankaree patibaddhtaon kaa nirmaan kar paane main sakasham hon
 For example, the legal system makes it necessary for them to follow their word
 gaiyr-sahakaari khelon main yah sambhav nahin hota
 It is often believed that communication between players is allowed in cooperative games, but not in non-cooperative games
 yah vargeekaran do dwiadhari kasautiyon ke aadhaar par asweekaar kar diya gaya he
 Of the two types of games, non-cooperative games are capable of performing situations to the best of detail and produce accurate results
 sahakaari khel vyapak rup se khel par kendrit hote hai
 Significant efforts have been made to connect these two routes
 tathakthith naish-program ne pehle hi anek sahakaari sthitiyon ko gaiyr-sahakaari santulanon ke rup main sthapit kar diya he
 Hybridized games have cooperative and non-cooperative elements
 udhaaharan ke liye sahakaari khelon main khilaadiyon ke gathbandhan banaaye jate hai, lekin ve ek gaiyr-sahakaari style main khelte hai
 a symmetrical game is a game in which the benefit of playing according to a specific strategy depends only on the other strategies used, not on those who play them
 yadi ranneetiyon se milanevaale munaafe ko badale bina khilaadiyon kii pahchaan badali ja sakati ho, to khel samamit hota he
 Many of the commonly studied 2 × 2 games are symmetric
 chikan, qaidi kaa asamanjas or barasinghe kaa shikaar ke maanak pradarshan sabhi samamit khel hai
 Some scholars may consider various asymmetric games as examples of these games
 haalaanki inamen se prayek khel ke liye sarvaadhik prachlit laabh samamit hote hai
 The most studied asymmetric games are those games that do not have the same set of strategies for both players
 udhaaharan ke liye, altimet game or dictator game main prayek khilaadi ke liye bhinn ranneetiyaan hoti hai
 However, it is also possible that a game has the same strategies for both players and is still asymmetric
 udhaaharan ke liye, donon khilaadiyon ke liye ranneetiyon ke samaan samucchy hone ke baavjood bhi dahini ore chitrit khel asamamit he
 Zero-sum games are special examples of steady-sum games, in which selections made by players neither increase nor decrease the available resources
 shunya-raashi khelon main, ranneetiyon ke prayek sangyojan ke liye, khel ke sabhi khilaadiyon ko milanevaale kul laabh kaa yogafal shunya hota he 
 The game of poker represents an example of a zero-sum game because any player wins the same amount of money as his opponent loses
 anya shunya-raashi khelon main sikkon kaa milan or go tathaa shatranj sahit adhikansh shastreey board khel shaamil hai
 Most of the games that have been studied by game theorists are non-zero-sum games because some of those receipts have gross results greater or less than zero
 anaupchaarik rup se, gaiyr-shunya-raashi khelon main, kisi ek khilaadi ko milanevaala laabh aavashyak taur par kisi anya khilaadi ko hone vaali haani se judaa nahin hota
 Fixed-sum games are related to game theory methods such as theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which the profits from the trade are probable
 ek atirikt nakli khilaadi, jisaki haniyaan khilaadi ke shuddh laabh kii kshatipurti karti hai, ko jodakar kisi bhi khel ko ek shunya-raashi khel main roopantarit kar paanaa sambhav hota he
 Simultaneous games are games in which both players play their moves together, or if they do not move simultaneously, the latter are ignorant of the moves of the first players
 aanukramik khel aise khel hote hai, jinamein baad main khilne vaale khilaadiyon ko purvavarti chaalon kii kuch jaankaree hoti he
 It is not necessarily complete knowledge of each game theory method of preceding players; This can be very little information
 udhaaharan ke liye, sambhav he ki koi khilaadi yah jaanata ho ki kisi purvavarti khilaadi ne koi vishisht chaal nahin chali thi, jabaki vah yah na jaanata ho ki pehle khilaadi ne anya uplabdh chaalon main se vastutah koun-si chaal chali thi
 The main differences between synchronous and sequential games are included in the various performances discussed above
 aksar, samakalik khelon ko darshane ke liye saamaanya rup kaa or aanukramik khelon ko darshane ke liye vistrut rup kaa prayog kiya jaataa he; haalaanki, takneekee rup se yah koi sakht niyam nahin he
 An important subset of sequential games consists of complete information
 ek khel purna jaankaree se yukt hota he, yadi sabhi khilaadi anya khilaadiyon dwaara pehle chali gai chaalon ke bare main jaanate hon
 Thus, only sequential games can be complete information because in synchronous games each player does not know the moves of other players
 game theory main adhyayan kiye jane vaale adhikansh khel apurna-jaankaree vaale khel hote hai, haalaanki, altimet game or shatpad khel sahit purna-jaankaree vaale khelon ke kuch rochak udhaaharan uplabdh hai
 Full-fledged games include chess, go, mankala and arima
 purna jaankaree ko aksar samast jaankaree samaj liya jaataa he, jo ek sadrush avadharana he
 For all the information, each player is required to know the strategies and realizations of other players, but it is not necessary to have knowledge of their game theory methods

 Pure mathematicians are not as constrained, and set theorists typically study games that persist for an unlimited number of moves, and the winner in them is not known until after the completion of all those moves
 saamanytah dhyaan is baat par zyaada kendrit nahin hota ki aise khelon ko khilne kii sarvshereshth vidhi kya he, balki keval is par hota he ki kya kisi khilaadi ke paas jeetne kii ranneeti he

 The majority of game theory relates to limited, discrete games, with limited number of players, moves, events, results, etc
 haalaanki anek avadharanaen vistaarit kii ja sakati hai
 Continuous games allow their players to select a strategy from a continuous strategy set
 udhaaharan ke liye, cornt pratiyogita kii rachana vishisht rup se is prakaar kii gai he ki khilaadiyon kii ranneetiyaan koi gaiyr-nakaaratmak matraaen, bhinnaatmak matraaon sahit, hoti hai
 Inferior games, such as the Continuous Pursuit and Evasion games, are continuous games
 vyaktigem theory nirnay samasyaon ko kabhi-kabhi "ek-khilaadi vaale khel" mana jaataa he
 Although these conditions are not game theoretic, they are constructed using several of the same tools as the Ingem Theory of Decision Theory rules
 keval do yaa do se adhik khilaadiyon ke hone par hi koi samasya khel saidhantik banati he
 Often a random player is added, who performs "opportunistic moves", also known as "natural moves"
 do-khilaadiyon vaale kisi khel main is khilaadi ko teesraa khilaadi nahin mana jaataa, balki khel main jahaan aavashyak ho, vahaan vah keval paase kii bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Games with an unlimited number of players are often called n-person games

 The first known discussion of game theory occurred in 1713 in a letter written by James Waldegrave
 is patr main waldegrev taash ke khel le har ke do-vyaktiyon vaale sanskaran ke samaadhaan ke liye ek minimax mishrit siddhant pradaan karte hai
 James Madison produced what we now know to be a game-theoretic analysis of how the differential theory states of different mechanisms of taxation can be expected to behave
 antony augustin cornt dwaara 1838 main Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses kaa prakaashan kiye jane tak kisi saamaanya khel saidhantik vishleshan kaa anusaran nahin kiya jaataa tha
 In this work Cornett considers a duopoly and presents a solution, which is a limited version of the Nash equilibrium
 haalaanki cornt kaa vishleshan waldegrev ke vishleshan se adhik saamaanya he, lekin jon won newman dwaara 1928 main shodh-patron kii ek shrunkhlaa kaa prakaashan kiye jane se purv tak ek adwitiya kshetra ke rup main game theory kaa vastutah koi astitv nahin tha
 Although the French mathematician Emily Borel did some preliminary work on the games, von Neumann can reasonably be credited with being the inventor of the game theory
 won newman ek budhimaan ganitagya the, jinka kaary samucchy siddhant se lekar unki gananaaon, jo anu va hydrogen bamon donon ke vikaas kii kunjee thim or antat sanganakon ke vikaas ke unke kaary tak vyapak rup se faila hua tha
 Von Neumann's work in game theory reached its peak in 1944 in Von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstam's book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior
 is gahan kaary main do-vyaktiyon vaale shunya-raashi khelon ke liye paraspar sangem theory samaadhaanon kii khoj karne hetu vidhiyaan shaamil hai
 During this time period, work on game theory was primarily focused on cooperative game theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for a group of individuals, assuming they can enforce consensus among themselves about appropriate strategies
 1950 main, qaidi kaa asamanjas prakat hua or RAND corporation main is khel par ek prayog kiya gaya
 Around this time, John Nash developed a criterion for interrelated theory of player strategies, known as the Nash equilibrium, and a broader range of games than the one proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstheim

1 sq

2 sq
 m of water
 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions
