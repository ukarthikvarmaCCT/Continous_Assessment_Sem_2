 The history of Uttarakhand is legendary
 uttrakhand kaa shabdic arth uttari bhu bhaag kaa roopaantar he
 This name is mentioned in the early Hindu texts, where it is mentioned as Kedarkhand and Manaskhand
 uttrakhand pracheen puranic shabd bhi he jo himalay ke madhya failaav ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa tha
 Uttarakhand is also known as "dev Bhoomi" because this entire region is the playground of religious and divine beings and the key and mysterious essence of the origin and glories of Hinduism
 paurav, kushaan, gupt, katyuri, raayak, paal, chand, parmaar va payaal rajvansh or angrezon ne baari-baari se yahan shashan kiya tha
 Although according to the British historians, the Huns, Shakas, Nagas, Khashs etc
 also used to live in the Himalayan region, but in the mythological texts and history, the name of Kedarkhand and Manaskhand is widely known
 is kshetra ko dev-bhoomi va tapobhumi mana gaya he
 The names of Kurmanchal and Kumaon of Manaskhand became popular during the reign of Chand kings
 kurmaanchal par chand raajaaon kaa shashan katyuriyon ke baad prarambh hokar san 1790 tak rahaa
 In 1790, the Gorkha army of Nepal invaded Kumaon and subjugated the Kumaon kingdom
 gorkhaon kaa kumaanun par san 1790 se 1815 tak shashan rahaa
 After the last defeat of the British in 1815, the Gorkha army returned to Nepal, but the British did not give the rule of Kumaon to the Chand kings and made the Kumaon under the East India Company
 is prakaar kumaanun par angrejo kaa shashan 1815 se prarambh hua
 According to historical accounts, Kedar division was divided into several strongholds
 in gadhon ke alag raja the or raajaaon kaa apane-apane aadhipaty vaale kshetra par samrajya tha
 According to historians, the king of the Panwar dynasty subordinated these Garhos to establish a unified Garhwal kingdom and made Srinagar their capital
 kedarkhand kaa gadhwal naam tabhi prachlit hua
 In 1803, the Gorkha army of Nepal invaded Garhwal state and took over Garhwal state
 maharaja gadhwal ne nepal kii gorkha sena ke adhipaty se rajya ko mukt karaane ke liye angrajo se sahaayta maangi
 The British army finally defeated the Gorkha army of Nepal near Dehradun in 1815

 Sudarshan Shah, the then Maharaja of Garhwal, established his capital on 28 December 1815 at a place called Tehri which was a small village at the confluence of Bhagirathi and Milangana
 kuch varshon ke uparant unke uttaradhikari maharaja narendra shah ne orathali naamak sthaan par narendra nagar naam se duusari rajdhani sthapit kii
 From 1815, Dehradun and Paudi Garhwal came under the British and Tehri Garhwal came under Maharaja Tehri
 katyuri raja vir dev ke pashchaat katuriyon ke samrajya kaa purna vibhaajan ho gaya tathaa yah na keval apni jati ke apitu kuch bahari kabeelon ke bhi adheen bat gaya
 a large part of Garhwal passed out from the hands of Katyuris and the remaining Kumaon region was divided into six tribes
 tatpashchaat katuris samrajya ko nepali raajaaon ahokchala tathaa karachala dev ne apane rajya main mila liya
 Both these attacks proved decisive due to mutual enmity between different tribes
 tatpashchaat sampurna samrajya 64 athwa kuch maton ke anusaar 52 gadhon main vibhajit ho gaya
 The chieftains of all these strongholds often quarreled among themselves
 solahavi shatabdi ke prarambh main kanak paal ke vanshaj ajay paal ne jo kii chandpur gadhi kabeelon kaa sardaar tha, sampoorn gadhwal ko ek kar diya
 The copper plates of Pandukeshwar indicate that the capital of this barrage was located in the Karthikeyapura niti-mana valley and later in the Katyur valley
 atkinshan ne kabul kii ghati se is vanshaj kii utpatti kaa pataa lagaaya tathaa unakon kaatoron se joda
 According to Garoula and Nautiyal, the Katyuri was a small Khasa tribe who originally lived in Joshimath north of Garhwal and later migrated to the Katyur valley of Kumaon
 katuriyon ne pauravon or tibeti hamalaavaron ke patan ke baad apni takat badhaai tathaa 7 veen shatabdi ke ant or 8 veen shatabdi ke armbh main ve swatantra ho gaye
 In ancient Hindu texts, Kumaon was called Manaskhand

 In a few decades, Garhwal gained a very important place in India and made its mark as the land of the brave castes
 landsdowne naamak sthaan par gadhwal sainikon kii 'gadhwal rifles' ke naam se do regiments sthapit kii gayi
 Undoubtedly, modern education and awareness helped Garhwalis to contribute greatly to the mainstream of India

 After independence, Garhwal became a district of Uttar Pradesh in 1947 and in 2001, Uttarakhand became a district

 The name 'rajpur' has also been mentioned on many ancient copper plates
 ek puranic katha ke anisaar daksh prajapati kii putree uma kaa vivaah shiv se hua tha
 Daksha Prajapati did not like Shiva, but he could not defer the requests of the gods, so he did not want his daughter to marry Shiva
 ek baar daksh prajapati ne sabhi devataaon ko apane yahan yajna main bulaayaa, parantu apane damaad shiv or beti uma ko nimantran tak nahin diya
 Uma stubbornly reached this yagna
 jab usne haridwar sthit canarvan main apane pita ke yajna main sabhi devataaon kaa sammaan or apane pati or apni niraadar hote hue dekha to vah atyant du:khee ho gayi
 In the Havan Kund of the yagna, she jumped and said, "I will make Shiva my husband in the next life too
" apane meraa or mere pati kaa jo niraadar kiya iske pratifal - swarup yajna ke havan - kund main syvan jalakar aapke yajna ko asafal karti hoon
 'when Shiva came to know that Uma became Sati, his anger was no longer in the cross
 unhone apane ganon ke dwaara daksh prajapati ke yajna ko nasht - bhrasht kar daalaa
 All the Gods and Gods, seeing this insurmountable form of Shiva, started thinking that Shiva should not be destroyed
 isliye devi - devataaon ne mahadev shiv se prarthana kii or unke krodh ko shant kiya
 Daksha Prajapati also apologized
 shiv ne unako bhi aashirwad diya
 However, upon seeing Sati's burnt body, his quietness swelled
 unhone sati ke jaale hue sharir ko kandhe par daalkar akaash - bhraman karnaa shuru kar diya
 In such a situation, wherever the parts of the body fall, there the power returned
 jahaan par sati ke nayan gire the ; vahiin par nainadevi ke rup main uma arthath nanda devi kaa bhavy sthaan ho gaya
 Today's Nainital is the place where the Nain of that goddess fell

 Ever since then, Shivapathi Nanda is worshiped here as Nainadevi
 yahaan ke nikat ek gaanv main machhlee evam ghongho ke jeevashm paye gayi hai jisase ingit hota he ki pithauragarh kaa kshetra himalay ke nirmaan se pehle ek vishaal jhil rahaa hoga
 Until recently, Pithoragarh has been ruled by the Khas dynasty, who are credited with building forts or coats here
 pithauragarh ke aasapaasd chaar coten hai jo bhatkot, duungarkot, udaikot tathaa oonchakot hai
 After the Khas dynasty, the Kachudi dynasty ruled here and the king of this dynasty was Ashok Malla, a contemporary of Balban
 isi avadhi main raja pithora dwaara pithauragarh sthapit kiya gaya tathaa isi ke naam par pithauragarh naam bhi padaa
 Three kings of this dynasty ruled from Pithoragarh itself and the brick fort built by them in the nearby village of Khakot was demolished by the then Collector of Pithoragarh in the year 1560
 varsh 1622 se aage pithauragarh par chand vansh kaa aadhipaty rahaa
 There is another controversial description of the history of Pithoragarh
 atkins ke anusaar, chand vansh ke ek samant piru gosai ne pithauragarh kii sthapana kii
 It seems that during the reign of King Bharti Chand of the Chand dynasty, his son Ratna Chand defeated King Doti of Nepal and took control of the Solar Valley and in 1449 merged it with Kumaon or Kurmanchal
 usee ke shasankaal main piru yaa prithvi gosai ne pithauragarh naam se yahaan ek kila banaaya
 It was later named Pithoragarh after the fort itself
 chandon ne adhikansh kumaun par apana adhikaar vistrut kar liya jahaan unhone varsh 1790 tak shashan kiya
 He defeated many tribes and also fought with the neighboring kings so that their position would be strengthened
 varsh 1790 main, gorkhiyaali kahe jane vaale gorakhon ne kumaun par adhikaar jamaakar chand vansh kaa shashan samaapt kar diya
 The exploitation of the Gorkha rulers came to an end in the year 1815 when the East India Company defeated them and established their suzerainty over Kumaon

 It is said that Prince Kanakpal of Malwa once visited Badrinathji where he met the mighty King Bhanu Pratap
 raja bhanu pratap unase kaaphi prabhavit hue or apni iklauti beti kaa vivaah kanakapaal se karvaa diya saath hi apana rajya bhi unhen de diya
 Gradually Kanakpal and his succeeding generations won their strongholds one by one and grew their kingdom
 is prakaar san 1803 tak sara gadhwal kshetra inke adhikaar main aa gaya
 Unsuccessful attacks by Gurkhas continued in those years, but in 1803, the Gurkhas were finally conquered in a battle of Dehradun in which King Pradvamun Shah was killed
 lekin unke shahjade jo us samay chote the vafaadaaron ke haathon bachaa liye gayi
 Gradually, the dominance of Gurkhas grew and they ruled for almost 12 years
 inkaa rajya kangra tak failaa hua tha, phir gorkhaon ko maharaja ranjit singh ne kangra se nikaal baahar kiya
 And here Sudarshan Shah, with the help of East India Company, recaptured his kingdom from the Gorkhas
 east india company ne phir kumaanun, dehradun or purv gadhwal ko british samrajya main mila diya or pashchim gadhwal raja sudarshan shah ko de diya jise tab tehari riyasat ke naam se janaa gaya
 King Sudarshan Shah made his capital Tehri or Tehri Nagar, later his successors Pratap Shah, Kirti Shah and Narendra Shah established the capital of this state, Pratap Nagar, Kirti Nagar and Narendra Nagar respectively

 baad main 24 farvari 1960 main uttar pradesh sarkaar ne isaki ek tehsil ko alag kar uttarkashi naam kaa ek ore jila bana diya
 The main reason for this is also the geographical conditions, it is the border district of Uttarakhand

 Kumau: Almora, Nainital, Pithoragarh
 , Udham Singh Nagar, Bageshwar, and Champawat
 The main basis of dividing all the districts is geographical

 In the Fidei Depositum in the Apostolic Constitution, John Paul II declared that Catholicism of the Catholic Church is "a legitimate and legitimate instrument for euclidean isolation and a definite ideal for teaching the faith"

 All India majlis-e-ittehad-ul Muslimeen or AIMIM is a recognized state political party in the Telangana state of the Indian government, with its head office in the old city of Hyderabad, with its roots in the majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen in 1927
 Was established in Hyderabad State, India
 
 AIMIM has won the Hyderabad constituency Lok Sabha seat since 1984
 2014 ke telugana vidhansabha chunaavon main, eimm ne saat siton par jeet hasil kii or bharat ke chunaav ayog dwaara 'rajya party' ke rup main manyata praapt kii
 The president of this party is Asaduddin Owaisi
 majalis ke itihaas ko do hisson main baanta ja saktaa he
 From the founding of Nawab Mahmud Nawaz Khan in 1928 to 1948 while this organization advocated maintaining Hyderabad a separate Muslim state
 is sanghathan ke sansthaapak sadasyon main hyderabad ke rajaneta saiyad kasim rizvi bhi shaamil the jo rajakar naam ke hathiyaarband hinsak sanghathan ke sargana bhi the
 These Razakars played an important role in raising MIM
 rajakar or emm ye donon hi sanghathan hyderabad ke deshadrohi or gaddaar nizaam ke kattar samarthak the
 This is the reason that when the country became independent in 1947, the merger of the princely state of Hyderabad with India was fiercely opposed by Kasim Rizvi and his paramilitary organization i
e
 Razakars
 us par 1948 main hyderabad state ke bharat main vilay ke baad bharat sarkaar ne pratibandh laga diya tha
 And the second part which started after the restoration of this party in 1957 when he added "all India" to his name and also changed his constitution
 Qasim Rajvi, who was the president of the Majlis at the time of the Indian government's crackdown against the state of Hyderabad, was arrested and handed over the reins of this party to Abdul Wahd Owaisi, the then famous lawyer, before leaving for Pakistan
 uske baad se yah party isi parivaar ke haath main rahi he
 abdul vahed ke baad salahuddin ovaisi uske adhyaksh bane or ab unke putr asaduddin ovaisi us ke adhyaksh or saansad hai jab unke chote bhai akbaruddin ovaisi vidhaan sabha main party ke netaa hai
 The leaders of this family and Majlis have been alleging that they have been promoting communal tension in Hyderabad with their provocative speeches
 But on the other hand, supporters of the Majlis see it as the answering power of the Bharatiya Janata Party and other Hindu organizations
 rajnatik shakti ke saath saath ovaisi parivaar ke saadhan or sampatti main bhi jabardast vruddhi hui he jisamen ek medical or ejineering college, kai duusare kalege or do aspataal bhi shaamil hai
 AEMEM recorded its first electoral victory in 1960 when Salahuddin Owaisi was elected to the Hyderabad Municipality and then two years later he became a member of the Legislative Assembly
 The power of the Majlis continued to grow
 badhati hui lokapriyata ke saath saath salahuddin ovaisi "salaar-e-millat" ke naam se mashhoor hue
 varsh 1984 main wo pehali baar hyderabad se lok sabha ke liye chune gaye saath hi vidhaan sabha main bhi us ke sadasyon kii sankhya babbti gai haalaanki kai baar is party par ek sampradayik dal hone ke aarope lage lekin andhra pradesh kii badi rajnatik partia congress or telugudesam donon ne alag alag samay par usase gathbandhan banaae rakhaa
 The interesting thing is that this alliance is still going on in Hyderabad Municipality and Majlis got the post of Mayor with the support of Congress
 2009 ke chunaav main eiemaiem ne vidhaan sabha kii saat siten jeetin jo kii use apane itihaas main milane vaali sab se zyada siten thim
 congress ke saath us kii lagbhag 12 varsh se chali aa rahi dosti main do maheene pehle us samay achaanak daraar pad gai jab charminar ke nikat ek mandir ke nirmaan ke vishay ne ek visphotak mode le liya
 The Majlis accused the Congress government of adopting anti-muslim policies and withdrew its support from him
 The uproar over Akbaruddin Owaisi's so-called speech and the way he is arrested and sent to jail is being seen in the context of the confrontation between Congress and Majlis
 adhiktar hyderabad tak simit majalis ab apana prabhaav andhra pradesh ke duusare jilon or padosi rajyon maharashtra or karnataka tak failaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Recently, he created a stir by winning 11 seats in Nanded Municipality of Maharashtra
 The Congress in Andhra Pradesh is troubled by the possibility that AEMEM may join hands with Jaganmohan Reddy's YSR Congress in the 2014 elections
 After the arrest of Akbaruddin Owaisi, there was no possibility of any compromise between the Majlis and the Congress
