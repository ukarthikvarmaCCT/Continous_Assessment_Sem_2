Hearing singing, where Radha and Gopi, immersed in their disconnection after Krishna moves from Mathura to Dwarka, are asking Phulwari, o Phulwari, why are you green? Why did you not burn standing in the disconnection of Krishna? On hearing this, Nida felt that the sorrow of the sorrow was opening in him

 tab kamaal amrohi ne unase sampark kiya or unhen film ke wo shesh rahe do gane likhane ko kaha jo ki unhone likhe
 Thus he started writing film songs and after that he wrote songs for many Hindi films

 There was a lot of opposition to this and many such established writers boycotted Nida and refused to attend such conferences where Nida was being called
 jab vah pakistan gaye to ek mushaayare ke baad kattarpanthi mullaon ne unka gheraav kar liya or unke likhe sher - But expressing his opposition asked him whether Nida considered any child greater than Allah? Nida replied that i only know that mosques make the hands of human beings, whereas Allah makes the child with his own hands

 The greenhouse effect or greenhouse effect is a natural process by which some gases present in the atmosphere of a planet or satellite help to make the temperature of the atmosphere relatively high
 in greenhouse gaison main carbon daai oxide, jal-vaashp, mithen aadi shaamil hai
 If there was no greenhouse effect, there would hardly have been life on Earth, because then the average temperature of the Earth would have been -18 ° c and not the current 15 ° C
 dharti ke vaataavaran ke taapmaana ko prabhavit karne vaale anek kaarak hai jisamen se greenhouse prabhaav ek he
 The existence of the greenhouse effect was told by Joseph Furrier in the year 1824
 unke dwaara diye gaye tark or saakshyon ko varsh 1827 or 1838 main cloud powlate ne or majboot kar diya
 John Tindall explained this in 1859 after experimenting and observing it

 He first made quantitative predictions that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere results from the doubling of gas
 lekin kisi bhi vaigyanik ne greenhouse shabd kaa prayog nahin kiya tha
 It was first used by Nils Gustaf Ekholm in 1901

 Psychoanalysis is a set of psychological ideas developed by Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud, to which some other psychologists also contributed
 manovishleshan mukhyat: maanav ke maansik kriyaaon evam vyavhaaron ke adhyayan se sambandhit he kintu ise samaajon ke upar bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Psychoanalysis has three uses: manorogi se baatcheet karne ke zariye uskaa upachaar karne kii vidhi or ek bauddhik anushaasan ke rup main manovishleshan kii sthapana zigmand froid ne kii thi
 Psychoanalysis has a profound effect on many disciplines of sociology
 stri- adhyayan, cinema-adhyayan or sahitya-adhyayan ne manovishleshan ke siddhant kaa istemaal karke apane shaastra main kai baarikiyon kaa samavesh kiya he
 There is only one branch of feminism known as psychoanalytic feminism
 froid kaa vichaar tha ki manushya ke avchetan ko alag- alag hisson main baant kar usee tarah se samajha ja saktaa he jis tarah prayogshaala main kisi rasayan kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 The theory of the subconscious is based on the belief that a person does not know a part of his brain himself
 uski abhivyakti uske sapanom, bolte-bolte zabaan phisal jane or anya shaareerik bimariyon ke rup main hoti he
 In the 1880s, Fried treated the hysteria of a woman named Bertha Papenheim, in collaboration with Joseph Breuer, a physician in Vienna
 manovigyaan ke itihaas main bartha ko uske chhadam naam ‘anna o’ ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Soon there was a difference of opinion with Fried's Beur over the question of the role of sexuality in hysteria
 froid ko yakeen tha ki maansik sadame kii prakruti kaafii-kuch sexual ho sakati he
 In 1895, his findings were published in the form of Studies in Hysteria in the course of treating other patients
 froid ne histyria kii vyakhya ek aise dimaagi sadame ke rup main kii jise rogi dabaata rahata he
 The patient is reminded of that shock by psychoanalysis
 froid ke baad manovishleshan ke siddhant kaa aage vikaas karne kaa shrey zaak lakaan ko jaataa he
 Fried believed that man suppresses the feeling of suffering when he fails to fulfill his desires, sexual desires and needs
 is prakriya main uske bheetar apurna kaamanaayon ke prati aparaadh-bodh paidaa ho jaataa he jisase kuntha, atmalochna or ek seemaa ke baad aatm-hinata or aatm-ghrinaa kii anubhutiyaan janm leti hai
 All this work-business runs within the subconscious
 yah avchetan hameshaa dabaa hua nahin rahata or sapanom ke rup main yaa ghatnaon ke prati anayas yaa tarksangat na lagane vaali anukriyaaon ke rup main saamne aata he
 Let us divide Froyd mind into three parts
 unhone ahan ko yatharthamulak or atmmoh ko janm dene vaale do roopon main baanta he
 The arbitrariness of the real ego regulates the equation of action and reality pushing towards happiness
 isi ke prabhaav main apni kamanaayen puri karne ke saath-saath vyakti saamaajik apekshaaon par bhi karaa utarane kii koshish karata he
 The status of a paragon is like a parent in the psyche and he commands his kamatattva and ego
 yahi paraahan balak ko apane pita kaa praadhikaar sweekaar karne kii taraf le jaataa he
 Under this effect, the son's desire to attain mother is repressed so that in the process he can become empowered like father
 pitrusatta is silsile se hi punarutpaadit hoti he
 According to Fried's interpretation, in order to engage in diverse relationships with life and the world, the fictional formula between the son and the mother needs to be disbanded, and this role comes from the father's part
 pita ke hastkshep ke tahat putr ko maan ke prati apni yon-kaamana tyaagni padati he
 He sees that the father has a penis that the mother does not have
 use dar lagata he ki agar usne pita ke praadhikaar kaa ulanghan kiya to use bhi maan kii hi tarah hi badhiya hona pad saktaa he
 Under the dilemma of castration, a crisis called matrimonomy is born, which is another important formulation of Fried
 maatrumanogranthi kaa sankat bete ko maan kaa parityag karne kii taraf le jaataa he
 Freud has termed this denial of primitive self-repression of his untimely sexual desire for mother
 aatm-daman ke isi prasang se vyakti ke maanas main avchetan kii buniyaad padati he
 Zac Lankan reconsidered psychoanalysis enforced by Freud and removed him from the realm of sexual desire and established him in the realm of language
 saath hi unhone atmmoh ko janm dene vaale ahan kii behatar vyakhya kii jabaki froid ne is pahalu par zyaada gaur nahin kiya tha
 Lanka saw that according to Fried, while falling prey to the maternal gland, the child comes to the age of speaking
 arthath aadim aatm-daman ke aadhaar par jab uske avchetan kii neenv pad rahi hoti he, us samay kartta ke rup main uske kadam bhashaa ke pradesh main pad jate hai
 This is the moment when the child is aware of the birth and suppression of desire through language
 chunki kaamana kabhi puri nahin ho sakati isliye vah maan ke rup main aaajeevan apni khoyi hui vastu kii talash karata rahata he
 In order to break the combination of son and mother, Lakan underlined the role of mirror-image
 aaine main khud ko dekh kar arthath apane hi bimb se saakshaatkaar hote samay use maan ke saath apane antar kaa ehsaas hota he
 While reaching this stage, under the influence of the rules made by the father, the child has entered the symbolic world of language
 bimbaatmakataa se pratikatmakataa main jane kii yah prakriya lakaan ke anusaar teen nirnaayak kshanon ke kram main ghatit hoti he When the mother shows the child between the ages of six months to one and a half years, she identifies herself separately and becomes aware of her unified and separate existence
 lakaan ise hi atmmoh ke kshan kii shuruyaat maanate hai arthath isi jagah ahan kii atmmoh sambandhi kism kaa janm hota he or deh prem kaa lakshya banati he
 But another incident happens at this moment
 maan se khud ko bhinn paa kar vah do baaten sochataa he
 First, it is me and second, i am other than being monogamous with mother
 isi jagah paraayepan kaa ehsaas janm letaa he
 The image that the child sees in the mirror is indicative of that
 pah chhavi uski iyatta na ho kar uskaa sthanapann bimb he
 Lakan explains that this is why the phase of mirror-image starts the development of ego, but this foundation is laid on an understanding that is not realistic
 manovishleshan kii duniya main is baat par kaafii bahes he ki kya manorogi ke maanas tak usase baatcheet ke zariye pahunchaa ja saktaa he? kya manorogi ke bheetar manochikitsak dwaara kii gayi poochtacha ke prati pratirodh nahin hota? in sawaalon kaa jawaab talashne kii prakriya main paidaa hue matbhedon ke centre main maatrumanogranthi or shishu-youniktaa se jude hue mudde hai
 Psychoanalysts who attribute hysteria to psychiatry tend to overestimate the moment of birth of the maternal psychosis, while those of fragmented psychosis tend to have a much lower priority

 Desher Katha is a revolutionary Bengali book written by the great revolutionary thinker and author Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar
 san 1904 main ‘desher katha’ sheershak se prakashit yah pustak british samrajya main gulaami kii zanjeeron main jakadi or shoshan kii yatnaa main jiti-jaagti bhartiya janata ke chitkaar kaa dastavej he
 Fearful of the information of publication of thirteen thousand copies of its five editions in just five years, the British banned the book in 1910
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ko tabah karne ke liye yahaan kii krishi vyavastha kaarigari or udyog-dhandhon ko tahas-nahas karne or bhartiya naagarik ke sambandh main avmaananaa bhare vaakyon kaa vyavhaar karne kii ghatnaon kaa pramanik chitra yahaan upasthit he
 Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar wrote the 'desher Katha' for the awakening and development of the consciousness of freedom in the country
 yadhyapi unhone congress dwaara sanchalit swadhinata andolan kaa samarthan kiya, lekin unhone us andolan kii reeti-niti kii aalochana bhi kii he
 He has written clearly in the role of Desher Katha that "our movement is just application of beggar
 hamalogon ko daata kii karunaa par ekant rup se nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 Despite this being true, where do we have other remedies apart from cheering again to address the duty-mind of politics
 ’’1 vastatu: ‘desher katha’ gulaami kii zanjeeron main jakadi or shoshan kii yatnaa main jiti-marati bhartiya janata ke chitkaar kii pramanik or prabhaavshaalee abhivyakti he
 This book was translated into Hindi by 'desh Ki Baat' by Baburao Vishnu Paradkar almost a century ago
 pehali baar san 1908 main mumbai se tathaa uskaa parivarddhit sanskaran san 1910 main kalakatta se prakashit hua
 Initially the publication and distribution of the book was a problem, it became uncommonly popular in 1905 with the introduction of the Swadeshi movement against bang-bhang
 madhav prasad mishra ne san 1908 main likhaa tha ki ‘jis pustak ke laagat tak ke vasuul hone main lekhak ko or mujhe ashanka thi uski thode hi dinon main sab pratiyaan bant gayi
 As soon as the piece of Bengal was there, Swadeshi movement was present there
 jisamen pustak ke pradipt vaakyon ne bhi apana prabhaav dikhalaayaa
 It would be considered a small matter to say that the Swadeshi movement is the fruit of this book, but there is no doubt that in the light of this movement, it did a work of disgust
 barisal ke vir swadesh hitaishi babu ashvini kumaar dutt ne apni kalighat vaali vaktruta main kaha tha ki itane dinon tak saraswati kii aradhana karne par bhi bengaaliyon ko maatrubhaasha main vaisaa upyogi granth likhnaa na aayaa jaisaa ek parinamdarshi maharashtra yuva ne likh dikhaaya
 Bengalis, read this book and consider the state and personal duty of our country
 ’’1 bang-bhang virdohi andolan ko ‘desher katha’ ne anek roopon main prabhavit kiya, use shakti or gati di or is prakriya main vah swadeshi andolan kii preranadai pustak ban gai
 The extraordinary popularity of Desher Katha can be gauged from the history of its publication between 1904 and 1908
 mahadev saaha ke anusaar ‘desher katha’ kaa ek hajaar pratiyon kaa pehla sanskaran san 1904 main chapa
 The second edition of Dohajar copies came out in 1905
 pustak kii maang ko dhyaan main rakhkar thik chaar maheene baad hi paanch hajaar pratiyon kaa teesraa sanskaran prakashit hua
 The fourth edition of two thousand copies of the book was printed in 1907 and the fifth edition of three thousand copies was printed in 1908
 1 mahaj paanch varshon main paanch sanskaran or teraa hajaar pratiyaan
 One notable thing in the context of the publication of this book is that the author used to add some new material to each edition, which increased the size of the book, but did not increase the price, but was reduced twice
 ‘desher katha’ ke likhe jane kii prishthibhumi kii ore sanket karte hue madhav prasad mishra ne san 1908 main likhaa tha, ‘‘jis samay yah pustak bangla main likhi gai thi us samay bengal ke tukade nahin hue the, swadeshi andolan kaa vichaar bhi logon ke ji main nahin aayaa tha
 People were skeptical of Lord Curzon's mischievous rule, but his Mohamedi sleep did not break even then
 bengal ke shikshit log aamod-pramod main lag rahe the or kitne hi saundaryopaas ‘mookabhinay’ kaa apurv kauthuk kar kritrim romaniyata kaa bazaar khol rahe the
 Shringar Rasa was gaining prominence in novels and plays and many of the great men of Bengal were spending their time assessing it
 yah kisi ko dhyaan bhi na tha ki unke desh kii kisi shochy dasha ho rahi he or aage kaisaa parivartan honevaala he
 ''2 aise samay main desher katha kaa likhaa janaa ek vaicharik visphot kii tarah tha, jisane jan-maanas ko dhakka dekar chakit karte hue jagaaya
 The English-raj was horrified by the immense popularity of Desher Katha and was seized on 28 September 1910 by issuing a communiqué
 ‘desher katha’ par pabandi kii khabar 30 sitambar ko kuch dainik akhabaaron main chhapi
 Except for the Hitwadi and Hitawar, no other journalism has opposed this ban
 hitvaadi-patrika main yah chapa ki pandit sakhaaraam ganesh deuskar kii pustak ‘desher katha’ par pabandi is aadhaar par lagaai gayi he ki usamen aisi samragi he jisko padhakar pathakon ke man main sarkaar ke prati algaav kaa bhav paidaa hoga
 3 In the article of Hitwadi many questions were asked to the government, but their answers were never given by the government
 ‘desher katha’ ke saath hi deuskar kii ek or kitaab par bhi pabandi lagaai thi
 That book was- 'tilkare Mukdma
 ’ jis samay ‘desher katha’ par pratibandh laga us samay tak ‘desher katha’ kaa hindi anuwaad ‘desh kaa baat’ se prakashit ho chukaa tha
 It is also written in the article of Hitwadi that 'desh Ki Baat' has not been banned
 hindi main ‘desher katha’ ke anuwaad kii kahani bahut dilachasp he
 Madhav Prasad Mishra helped the author in the publication of 'desher Katha' in Bangla
 unhone pehle sanskaran ke prakashit hote hi uskaa hindi main anuwaad prarambh kar diya tha
 Some of his excerpts were also published in the Hindi magazine Vaishopakar of Calcutta, but the entire book could not be translated at that time
 baad main amrit laal chakravarti ne ‘desher katha’ ke hindi anuwaad kaa kaam puraa kiya
 At that time Amrit Lal Chakraborty was the editor of a magazine called 'sri Venkateswara Samachar'

 is pustak ne hamako aarambh main deshbhakti kii paryaapt prerana di isamen andeh nahin
 The character of the popularity of 'desh Ki Baat' in Hindi is gauged by the fact that Radhakrishna Mishra, the brother of Madhav Prasad Mishra and a well-known poet of his time, wrote a poem on 'desh Ki Baat'
 us kavita kaa ek ansh madhav prasad mishra ne ‘desh kii baat’ ke mukhabandh ke aarambh main uddhrut kiya he, jo is prakaar he : The remaining part of this poem is quoted by Shri Narayan Chaturvedi from his memory in his book 'modern Hindi Ka Adikal'

 Today, on the lines of his politics, there is a political aspect called Shiv Sena in Nepal and India
 shivaji maharaj kaa janm 19 farvari 1630 main shivneri durg main hua tha
 Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630 in Shivneri fort with the womb of Jijabai, wife of Shahji Bhonsle
 shivneri kaa durg puna se uttar kii taraf junnar nagar ke paas tha
 His childhood was spent under the guidance of his mother Jijau Maa Saheb
 vah sabhi kalaon main maahir the, unhone bachapan main raajnneeti evam yuddh kii shiksha lee thi
 These belonged to the Bhonsle sub-caste who were originally from the Kshatriya Maratha caste
 gagabhatta ke anusaar shivaji kaa vansh mewar ke prasiddh guhil sisodiya vansh se miltaa he
 It is due to Shivaji that the entire Maratha community has got the status of being a Kshatriya

 shaasha varg kii karatuuton par ve jhallaate the or baichaiyn ho jate the
 The flame of freedom was ignited in his child's heart
 unhone kuch swamibhakt saathiyon kaa sanghathan kiya
 As the situation progressed, his resolve to break the shackles of foreign rule became stronger
 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa vivaah san 14 may 1640 main saibai nimbalkar ke saath laal mahal, puna main hua tha
 At that time the kingdom of Bijapur was going through a period of mutual struggle and foreign invasion
 aise samrajya ke sultan kii seva karne ke badale unhone maawalon ko bijapur ke kilaaf sangathit karne lage
 Maval Pradesh is connected to the Western Ghats and is some 150 km long and 30 km wide
 ve sangharmpurn jivan vyateet karne ke kaaran kushal yoddha maane jate hai
 Marathas and people of all castes live in this region
 shivaji maharaj in sabhi jati ke logon ko lekar maawalon naam dekar sabhi ko sangathit kiya or unase sampark kar unke pradesh se parichit ho gaye the
 He had started the construction of the fort by bringing Maval youths
 maawalon kaa sahyog shivaji maharaj ke liye baad main utana hi mahatvapurn sabit hua jitna shershah suri ke liye afagaanon kaa saath
 At that time Bijapur was troubled by mutual struggle and Mughal invasion
 bijapur ke sultan adilshaah ne bahut se durgon se apni sena hataakar unhen sthaneey shaskaon yaa samanton ke haath saunp diya tha
 When Adilshah fell ill, anarchy spread in Bijapur and Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of the opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 shivaji maharaj ne iske baad ke dinon main bijapur ke durgon par adhikaar karne kii niti apanaai
 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Shivaji sent his envoy to Sultan Adilshah and informed him that he was ready to pay better money than the first fortress and handed over this area to him
 unhone adilshaah ke darbariyon ko pehle hi rishwat dekar apane paksh main kar liya tha or apane darbariyon kii salaah ke mutabik adilshaah ne shivaji maharaj ko us durg kaa adhipati bana diya
 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset
 usne shahji raaje ko apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha
 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe
 usake baad aurangzeb ne mirzaraja jaisingh ko bhejkar 23 kilon par kabja kiya baad main shiji maharaj ke mawala tanaji malusre ne kondhana durg par kabja kiya par us yuddh main vah viragati ko praapt hua uski yaad main kondana par adhikaar karne ke baad uskaa naam singhgarh rakhaa gaya
 Shahaji Raje was given the title of Poona and Soupa and the fortress of Soupa was in the hands of his relative Baji Mohite
 shivaji maharaj ne raat ke samay soopa ke durg par akraman karke durg par adhikaar kar liya or baaji mohite ko shahji raaje ke paas karnataka bhej diya
 Some part of his army also came in the service of Shivaji Maharaj
 isi samay purandar ke kiledaar kii mrityu ho gai or kile ke uttaradhikaar ke liye uske teenon beton main ladaai chhid gai
 Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar on the invitation of two brothers and, taking recourse to diplomacy, he imprisoned all the brothers
 is tarah purandar ke kile par bhi unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed
 1647 isvi tak ve chaakan se lekar nira tak ke bhubhag ke bhi adhipati ban chuke the
 With his increased military power, Shivaji Maharaj planned to enter the plains
 ek ashwarohi sena kaa gathan kar shivaji maharaj ne aabaaji sonder ke netritv main konkan ke viruddh ek sena bheji
 Abaji captured nine other fortifications including Konkan
 iske alaava taala, mosmala or raiti ke durg bhi shivaji maharaj ke adheen aa gaye the
 All the property looted was kept safe in Raigad
 kalyaan ke governor ko mukt kar shivaji maharaj ne kolaba kii ore rukh kiya or yahan ke pramukhon ko videshiyon ke kilaaf yuddh ke liye uksaaya
 Sultan of Bijapur was already in a rage before Shivaji Maharaj's antics
 usne shivaji maharaj ke pita ko bandi banane kaa aadesh de diya
 Shahaji Raje was in Karnataka at the time and was taken prisoner by a treacherous assistant Baji Ghorpade and brought to Bijapur
 un par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone qutubashah kii seva praapt karne kii koshish kii thi jo golconda kaa shaasha tha or is kaaran adilshaah kaa shatru
 After the mediation of two chieftains of Bijapur, Shahaji Maharaj was freed on the condition that he would control Shivaji Maharaj
 agle chaar varshon tak shivaji maharaj ne bijipur ke kilaaf koi akraman nahin kiya
 During this time he organized his army
 shahji kii mukti kii sharton ke mutabik shivaji rajane bijapur ke kshetron par akraman to nahin kiya par unhone dakshin-pashchim main apni shakti badhaane kii cheshtaa kii
 But in this order the state of Javali was acting as a hindrance
 yah rajya satara ke sudur uttar pashchim main vama or krishna nadi ke bich main sthit tha
 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army
 chandrarav more or uske donon putron ne shivaji ke saath ladaai kii par ant main ve bandi bana liye gaye par chandrarav bhaag gaya
 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion
 isse shivaji ko us durg main sangrahit aath vanshon kii sampatti mil gai
 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army
 shivaji ke bijapur tathaa mughal donon shatru the
 At that time, Shahzada Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Deccan
 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin
 iske parinamswaroop aurangzeb shivaji se khafaa ho gaya or maitri vaarta samaapt ho gai
 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira
 par zanjeera ke siddiyon ke saath unki ladaai kai dinon tak chali
 After this Shivaji himself invaded Janjira and took control of South Konkan and collected annual tax from the Portuguese of Daman
 kalyaan tathaa bhiwandi par adhikaar karne ke baad vahaan nausainik adda bana liya
 By this time, Shivaji had become the owner of 40 fortifications
 idhar aurangzeb ke agra laut jane ke baad bijapur ke sultan ne bhi raahat kii saans lee
 Now Shivaji was the most powerful enemy of Bijapur
 shahji ko pehle hi apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha gaya tha par shahji ne isamen apni asamarthta jaahir kii
 The Sultan of Bijapur sent Abdullah Bhatari against Shivaji to deal with Shivaji
 afajal ne 12 xxrep 4 0 sainikon ke saath 1659 main kooch kiya
 Destroying the temples of Tuljapur, he came to Shiraval, 30 km north of Satara
 par shivaji pratapgarh ke durg par hi rahe
 Afzal Khan sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar for a treaty
 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya 
 After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji took control of the fort of Panhala
 iske baad pavangadh or vasantgarh ke durgon par adhikaar karne ke saath hi saath unhone rustam khan ke akraman ko vifal bhi kiya
 With this they also captured Rajapur and Dawul
 ab bijapur main aatank kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya or vahaan ke samanton ne aapasi matbhed bhulaakar shivaji par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 2 October 1665, the Bijapuri army captured the Panhala fort
 shivaji sankat main funs chuke the par raatri ke andhkaar kaa laabh uthaakar ve bhaagane main safal rahe
 The Sultan of Bijapur, taking command himself, withdrew his authority over Panhala, Pawangarh, looted Rajapur and killed the head of Shringargarh
 isi samay karnataka main siddijohar ke vidroh ke kaaran bijapur ke sultan ne shivaji ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Shivaji's father Shahaji acted as a mediator in this treaty
 san 1662 main hui is sandhi ke anusaar shivaji ko bijapur ke sultan dwaara swatantra shaasha kii manyata mili
 According to this treaty, the area ranging from Kalyan in the north to Ponda in the south and from Indapur in the east to Davul in the west came under Shivaji's control
 shivaji kii sena main is samay tak 3 xxrep 4 0 paidal or 1000 ghudsavaar ho gaye the
 After the end of the race to become king in North India, Aurangzeb's attention shifted to the south
 wo shivaji kii badhati prabhutaa se parichit tha or usne shivaji par niyantran rakhane ke udyeshy se apane mamaa shysta khan ko dakshin kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Shaiska Khan took 1,50,000 fos and took control of the fort of Supan and Chakan and reached Poona
 usne 3 saal tak mawal main lutmar ki
 One night Shivaji attacked him with his 350 Mavalos
 shysta to khidki ke raste batch nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa par use isi kram main apni chaar anguliyon se haath dhonaa padaa
 The sons of Shaista Khan, and forty guards and countless soldiers were slaughtered
 is ghatana ke baad aurangzeb ne shysta ko dakkan ke badale bengal kaa soobedaar bana diya or shahjada muajjam shysta kii jagah lene bheja gaya
 This victory increased Shivaji's reputation
 6 saal shaista khan ne apni 15 xxrep 4 0 fuj lekar raja shivaji kaa pura mulukh jalaakar tabah kar diya tha
 Therefore, Shivaji started looting in the Mughal territories to recover his damages
 surat us samay pashchimi vyapaariyon kaa garh tha or hindustani musalamaanon ke liye haj par jane kaa dwaar
 It was a prosperous city and its port was very important
 shivaji ne chaar hajaar kii sena ke saath 1664 main chah dinon tak surat ke dhanadya vyapaariyon ko lutaa
 They did not rob the common man and then returned
 is ghatana kaa zikr dach tathaa angrejon ne apane lekhon main kiya he
 By that time, European traders had settled in India and other Asian countries
 nadir shah ke bharat par akraman karne tak kisi bhi europea shakti ne bhartiya mughal samrajya par akraman karne kii nahin sochi thi
 Disgusted by the loot of Shivaji in Surat, Aurangzeb appointed Gaiyasuddin Khan as a faujdar of Surat in place of Inayat Khan
 or shahjada muajjam tathaa upasenapati raja jaswant singh kii jagah diler khan or raja jaisingh kii niyukti kii gai
 King Jai Singh attacked Shivaji with the support of Sultan of Bijapur, European powers and small feudatories
 is yuddh main shivaji ko haani hone lagi or haar kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue shivaji ne sandhi kaa prastaav bheja
 According to this treaty in June 1665, Shivaji will give 23 fortifications to the Mughals and thus only 12 fort will be left with him
 in 23 durgon se hone vaali aamadani 4 lakh hun salanaa thi
 The areas of Balaghat and Konkan will be given to Shivaji, but he will have to pay 40 lakh Huns in 13 installments in return
 iske alaava prativarsh 5 lakh hun kaa rajasav bhi ve denge
 Shivaji himself will be free from being in Aurangzeb's court, but his son Shambhaji will have to fight in the Mughal court
 bijapur ke kilaaf shivaji mughalon kaa saath denge
 Shivaji was called to Agra where he felt that he was not getting proper respect
 iske kilaaf unhone apana rosh bhare darbar main dikhaaya or aurangzeb par vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aurangzeb was angered by this and he saw Shivaji being detained and guarded by 5000 soldiers
 kuch hi dinon baad raja shivaji ko maar daalane kaa iraadaa aurangzeb kaa tha
 But both Shivaji and Sambhaji, with their courage and courage, managed to escape from it
 sambhaaji ko mathura main ek vishwasi brahman ke yahan chhod shivaji maharaj banaras, gayi, puri hote hue sakushal rajgad pahunch gaye 
 This gave the Marathas a new life
 aurangzeb ne jaisingh par shaq karke uski hatya vish dekar karvaa daali
 Shivaji signed a second treaty with the Mughals in 1668 after Jaswant Singh took the initiative
 aurangzeb ne shivaji ko raja kii manyata di
 Shivaji's son Shambhaji received a mansabdari of 5000 and Shivaji was returned to the districts of Poona, Chakan and Soupa
 par, singhgarh or purandar par mughalon kaa adhipaty bana rahaa
 Shivaji looted Surat city for the second time in 1670
 nagar se 132 lakh kii sampatti shivaji ke haath lagi or lautate vakt unhone mughal sena ko surat ke paas phir se haraaya
 By 1674, Shivaji had captured all the territories which had to be given to the Mughals under the Treaty of Purandar
 pashchimi maharashtra main swatantra hindu raashtra kii sthapana ke baad shivaji ne apana rajbhishek karnaa chaha, parantu muslim sainiko ne brahamanon ko dhamkee di ki jo bhi shivaji kaa rajbhishek karegaa unki hatya kar di jaayegi
 jab ye baat shivaji tak pahunchi kii mughal sardaar aise dhamkee de rahe he tab shivaji ne ise ek chunauti ke rup me liya or kaha kii ab wo us rajya ke brahamn se hi abhishek karavaayenge jo mughalon ke adhikaar main he
 shivaji ke nijee sachiv balaji ji ne kaashi main teen duto ko bheja, cunki kaashi mughal samrajya ke adheen tha
 jab duuton ne sandesh diya to kaashi ke brahamn kaaphi prasann huye
 kintu mughal sainiko ko yah baat pataa chal gai tab un brahmano ko pakad liya
 parantu yukti purvak un brahmanon ne mughal sannico ke samaksh un duuton se kaha ki shivaji koun he ham nahin jaanate he
 ve kis vansh se hai ? duuton ko pataa nahin tha isaliye unhone kaha hamen pataa nahin he
 tab mughal sainiko ke sardaar ke samaksh un brahmanon ne kaha ki hamen kahin anyatra janaa he, shivaji kis vansh se hai aapane nahin bataaya at: aise main ham unke rajbhishek kaisekar sakate hai
 ham to tirth yatra par ja rahe hai or kashika koi anya brahman bhi rajbhishek nahin karegaa jab tak raja kaa purna parichay na ho at: aap waapas ja sakate hai
 mughal sardaar ne khush hoke brahmano ko chod diya or duto ko pakad kar aurangzeb ke paas dilli bhejne kii sochi par wo bhi chup ke se nikal bhaage
 waapas laut kar unhone ye baat balaji aav tathaa shivaji ko bataai
 parantu aashcharya janak rup se do din baad vahi brahman apane shishyon ke saath raigarh pahuchen ore shivaji kaa rajbhishek kiya
 After this, the Mughals tried to divide and even after the coronation of Shivaji, threatened the Brahmins of Poona that they should not accept Shivaji as the king
 So that people do not even consider it !! But they did not work
 Shivaji established the Ashtapradhan Mandal
 Apart from the envoys, representatives of various states, foreign traders were also invited to this ceremony
 par unke rajbhishek ke 12 din baad hi unki mata kaa dehanth ho gaya tha is kaaran se 4 oktober 1674 ko duusari baar shivaji ne chhatrapati kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 The ceremony, which took place twice, cost about 50 lakh rupees

 It was the first Hindu kingdom in the south after the fall of Vijayanagar
 ek swatantra shaasha kii tarah unhone apane naam kaa sikaa chalavaaya
 After this, the Sultan of Bijapur sent two of his commanders against Shivaji for the Konkan victory but they failed
 san 1677-78 main shivaji kaa dhyaan karnataka kii ore gaya
 On April 4, 1680, Shivaji passed away after commanding Konkan in south of Bombay, Belgaum and Dharwad region west of Tungabhadra river, Mysore, Valari, Trichur and Jinji
 teen saptaah kii beemaari ke baad shivaji kii mrityu 3 april 1680 main hui
 At that time, Sambhaji inherited Shivaji's succession
 shivaji ke jyeshtha putr sambhaji the or dusi patni se rajaraam naam ek doosraa putr tha
 At that time Rajaram was only 10 years old, so the Marathas accepted Shambhaji as the king
 us samay aurangzeb raja shivaji kaa dehant dekhakar apni puure bharat par rajya karne ki abhilasha se apni 5,00,000 sena sagar lekar dakshin bharat jeetne niklaa
 Aurangzeb finished Adilshi in 2 days and Qutb Shahi in 1 day
 par raja sambhaji ke netritv main marathao ne 9 saal yuddh karte huye apni swatantrata barkaraar rakhi
 Aurangzeb's son Shahzada Akbar revolted against Aurangzeb
 sambhaji ne usko apane yahan sharan di
 Aurangzeb now vigorously started attacking against Sambhaji
 usne antatah 1689 main sambhaji ke bivi ke sage bhai ne yane ganoji shirke kii mukhabari se sambhaji ko mukarav khan dwaara bandi bana liya
 Aurangzeb misbehaved with Raja Sambhaji and miserably killed him
 apni raja ko aurangzeb ne badasluki or buree haal maaraa hua dekhakar pura maratha swarajya krodhit hua
 He continued his struggle with the Mughals under the leadership of the Third Rajaram with his full strength
 1700 isvi main rajaraam kii mrityu ho gai
 After that Rajaram's wife Tarabai ruled as guardian of 4-year-old son Shivaji II
 aakhirkaar 25 saal maratha swarajya ke yuddh lad ke thake huye aurangzeb kii usee chhatrapati shivaji ke swarajya main dafan huye
 Shivaji is known as a skilled and enlightened emperor
 yadhyapi unako apane bachapan main parmparik shiksha kuch khaas nahin mili thi, par ve bhartiya itihaas or raajnneeti se suparichit the
 He considered Shukracharya and Kautilya to be ideal and resorted to diplomacy many times
 apane samakaleen mughalon kii tarah vah bhi nirankush shaasha the, arthath shashan kii samoochee bagdor raja ke haath main hi thi
 But there was a council of eight ministers called Ashtapradhan to help with his administrative work
 isamen mantriyon ke pradhan ko peshwa kehete the jo raja ke baad sabase pramukh hasti tha
 Amatya used to look after the functions of finance and revenue, then the minister used to take care of the personal diary of the king
 sachiv dafatari kaam karte the jisame shahi muhar lagaana or sandhi patron kaa aalekh taiyaar karnaa shaamil hote the
 Sumant was the foreign minister
 sena ke pradhan ko senapati kehete the
 The head of charity and religious affairs was called Panditrao
 nyaayadhish nyaayik maamalon kaa pradhan tha
 The Maratha Empire was divided into three or four divisions
 prayek praant main ek soobedaar tha jise prantapati kaha jaataa tha
 Each Subedar also had an Ashtapradhan Committee
 kuch praant keval karadaata the or prashasan ke maamle main swatantra
 The judiciary was based on the ancient system
 shukracharya, kautilya or hindu dharamshastron ko aadhaar maanakar nirnay diya jaataa tha
 The Patel of the village used to investigate criminal cases
 rajya kii aay kaa saadhan bhoomikar tha par chouth or sardeshmukhi se bhi rajasav vasula jaataa tha
 'chauth' was a tax levied to guarantee the security of neighboring states
 shivaji apane ko maraathon kaa sardeshmukh kahata the or isi haisiyat se sardeshmukhi kar vasula jaataa tha
 After the coronation, he entrusted the work of one of his ministers to form suitable Sanskrit words for the Persian words used in the government
 ramachandra amaatya ne dhundhiraj naamak vidwaan kii sahaayta se 'rajyavyavahaarkosh' naamak granth nirmit kiya
 This dictionary had Sanskrit words equivalent to 1380 Persian administrative words
 isamen ramachandra ne likhaa he- Shivaji was a devoted Hindu and he was also religious tolerant
 unke samrajya main musalamaanon ko dharmik swatantraaa thi
 Shivaji gave grants for the construction of many mosques
 hindu panditon kii tarah musalmaan santon or fakiron ko bhi sammaan praapt tha
 There were also Muslim soldiers in his army
 shivaji hindu sankruti ko badhaava dete the
 The emphasis was on traditional Hindu values and education
 vah apane abhiyaanon kaa armbh bhi akasar dashahra ke avasar par karte the
 Shivaji Maharaj got Swaraj's education from his father, when the Sultan of Bijapur made Shahji Raje a prisoner, then like an ideal son he made a treaty with the Shah of Bijapur and got Shahji Raje released
 isse unke charitra main ek udaar avyav hojar aata he
 Later, he did not kill his father as other emperors did
 shahji raaje ke marane ke baad hi unhone apana rajbhishek karavaaya hanlanki wo us samay tak apane pita se swatantra hokar ek bade samrajya ke adhipati ho gayi the
 His leadership was accepted by everyone, that is why there was no major incident like internal rebellion during his reign
 vah ek achche senanayake ke saath ek achche kootneetijna bhi the
 In many places he had run away from the war instead of fighting directly
 lekin yahi unki kootneeti thi, jo har baar bade se bade shatru ko maat dene main unka saath detii rahi
 Shivaji Maharaj's diplomacy called "ganimi Kawa", in which a sudden attack on the enemy is defeated by him, is remembered fondly and with no respect
 shivaji maharaj ke gaurav main ye panktiyaan prasiddh hai- The office of the Prime Minister of India refers to a group of officers and employees directly below the Prime Minister of India

 In very severe cases, death can occur within a few hours 
 gambhir maamalon main uchit ilaaj hone par bhi mrityu dar 20% tak ho sakati he
 Treatment is often not satisfactory in the epidemic area, so the death rate is very high and 1 out of every 10 malaria patients die
 malaria yuva bacchon ke vikasshil mastishk ko gambhir kshati pahunchaa saktaa he
 Children are more likely to develop brain malaria and in this case the blood supply to the brain can decrease and often directly harm the brain as well
 atyadhik kshati hone par haath-paanv ajeeb tarah se mud-tud jate hai
 In children with severe malaria over the long term, poor mental development is often seen
 garbhvatee striyaan machharon ke liye bahut aakarshak hoti hai or malaria se garbh kii mrityu, nimna janm bhaar or shishu kii mrityu tak ho sakate hai
 It is mainly caused by infection with P
 falciparum, but P
 vivax can also do this
 pi

 ovel paraseete varshon tak yakrut me chupe rah sakate hai
 Therefore, it is wrong to assume that the disease has been completely eradicated even after the disease has been eradicated from the blood
 pi

 One out of every five cases of P
 vivax in temperate regions suddenly arises next year by hiding in cold weather
 malaria plasmodium gana ke protozoa parjiviyon se failata he
 Four members of this group infect humans - Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae
 inamen se sarvaadhik khatarnaak pi
 failciparum mana jaataa he, yah malaria ke 80 pratishat maamalon or 90 pratishat mrityuon ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 This parasite also infects birds, crawling creatures, monkeys, chimpanzees and mice

 The primary nutrient of the malaria parasite is the female anopheles mosquito, which also helps to spread malaria infection
 anopheleas gana ke machhar saare sansar main faile hue hai
 Only the female mosquito nourishes by blood, so it is the carrier and not the male
 maadaa machhar anopheleas raat ko hi katati he
 In the evening, it goes out in search of prey and roams till the hunt is found
 yah khadey pani ke andar andey detii he
 Both the eggs and the larvae emanating from them are in dire need of water
 iske atirikt larva ko saans lene ke liye pani kii sataha par baar-baar aana padataa he
 The mosquitoes take about 10–14 days to hatch into the egg-larva-pupa and then adults
 vayask machhar paraag or sharkara vaale anya bhojya-padaarthon par palate hai, lekin maadaa machhar ko andey dene ke liye rakt kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The female Anopheles mosquito becomes the first prey and carrier of the malaria parasite
 yuva machhar sankramit maanav ko kaatane par uske rakt se malaria paraseete ko grahan kar lete hai
 The germs of the parasite present in the blood develop into males and females in the stomach of the mosquito and then together form an ovum that grows in the wall of the mosquito's intestines
 paripakv hone par ye footte hai or isamen se nikalne vaale bijaanu us machhar kii laar-grathiyon main pahunch jate hai
 When a mosquito bites a healthy human, it sends saliva as well as spores to the skin
 maanav sharir main ye bijaanu phir palakar jananaanu banaate hai, jo phir aage sankraman failaate hai
 In addition, malaria can also be spread by transfusion of infected blood, but this is very unusual
 malaria paraseete kaa maanav main vikaas do charnon main hota he: yakrut main pratham charan or laal rakt koshikaon main doosraa charan
 When an infected mosquito bites a human, the spores enter the human blood and reach the liver and infect the liver cells within 30 minutes of entering the body
 phir ye yakrut main alangik janan karne lagate hai
 This phase lasts for 6 to 15 days
 is janan se hajaaron anshaanu banate hai jo apni mehmaan koshikaon ko tod kar rakt main pravesh kar jaate hai tathaa laal rakt koshikaon ko sankramit karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 This starts the second phase of the disease

 ovel ke kuch bijaanu yakrut ko hi sankramit karke ruk jate hai or suptanu ke rup main niskriy ho jate hai
 These remain dormant for 6 to 12 months and then suddenly appear as bacteria and cause disease
 laal rakt koshika main pravesh karke ye paraseete khud ko phir se guneet karte rahete hai
 They develop into ring form and then make bhosa and then multinuclear schizont and then many more
 samay samay par ye anshaanu poshak koshikaon ko todakar nayin laal rakt koshikaon ko sankramit kar dete hai
 Many such phases go on
 malaria main bukhaar ke daure aane kaa kaaran hota he hajaaron anshaanuon kaa ekasaath nai laal rakt koshikaon ko prabhavit karnaa
 The malaria parasite spends almost all of its life hiding in liver cells or red blood cells, thus protecting the immune system of the human body
 tilli main nasht hone se bachane ke liye pi
 failciparum ek anya chaal chalata he- yah laal rakt koshika kii sataha par ek chipkau protein pradarshit kara detaa he jisase sankramit rakt koshikaaye ko choti rakt vahikaaon main chipak jaati hai or tilli tak pahunch nahin paati hai
 For this reason only the ring forms are seen in the bloodstream, in all other developmental stages it sticks to the surfaces of small blood vessels
 is chipchipahat ke chalate hi malaria raktastrav kii samasya karata he
 Although the protein pfemp1 displayed on the surface of an infected red blood cell can become a victim of the body's immune system, it does not occur because this protein has a very high diversity
 har paraseete ke paas iske 60 prakaar hote he vahiin sabhi ke paas mila kar asankhya roopon main ye is protein ko pradarshit kar sakate hai
 They are one step ahead of the body's immune system by repeatedly changing this protein
 kuch anshaanu nar-maadaa jananaanuon main badal jate hai or jab machhar katata he to rakt ke saath unhen bhi le jaataa he
 Here they complete their life cycle again
 anek malaria-grast kshetron main bukhaar ke har marij ko malaria kaa anumanik nidaan de diya jaataa he or kunain se ilaaj shuru kar diya jaataa he
 Along with this, blood plaques are also made, but the results are not awaited to start treatment

 But a study in Malawi suggests that unnecessary treatment of malaria can be avoided if the temperature of the anus, anemia, and spleen size are taken into consideration along with fever
 )
 Testing blood vessels under a microscope is considered the cheapest, best and reliable method of diagnosing malaria
 is pareekshan se chaaron malaria parjiviyon ke vishisht lakshanon ke dwaara alag-alag nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Blood plaques are made in two ways - thin and thick
 patali patticoon main paraseete kii banaavat ko behatar dhang se surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa he, vahiin duusari ore moti patticoon se kam samay main rakt kii adhik maatra kii jaanch kii ja sakati he or isse kam maatra ke sankraman kaa bhi nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Experienced testers can detect up to 0
 xxrep 6 0 1 percent infection in the blood
 in kaarnon se moti or patali donon pattiyaan banaai jaati hai
 Also, it is necessary to examine more than one ring phase, because the ring phases of the four parasites often look the same
 
 Several antigen-based dipstick tests or malaria rapid antigen tests are also available to diagnose malaria
 inhen rakt kii keval ek boond kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, or sirf 15-20 minute main hi parinaam saamne aa jaataa he, prayogshaala kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 These are considered to be slightly inferior to microscopic examination
 lekin jin kshetron main sookshmdarshi jaanch kii suvidha uplabdh nahin hoti yaa pareekshakon ko malaria ke nidaan kaa anubhav nahin hota vahaan prabhavit kshetra main ja kar rakt kii ek boond se antigen pareekshan kar liya jaataa he
 These tests were first developed using the fermented glutamate dehydrogenase of P
 falciparum as an antigen
 lekin jaldi hi ek anya kinvak lactate dihadrosenez kaa prayog karke optimal-iti naamak pareekshan kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 These enzymes are not present in the blood for a long time and when the parasite is eliminated, they also get out of the blood, so these tests are also used to know the success or failure of treatment
 optimal-iti failciparum or gaiyr-failciparum malaria main antar bhi kar saktaa he
 It can diagnose P
 falciparum by 0

 With proper treatment, the patient gets well
 kuch lakshanon kaa upachaar saamaanya dawaaon se kiya jaataa he, saath main malaria-rodhi davaayen bhi di jaati he
 These drugs are of two types - first those which are resistant and protect against disease when taken before the disease occurs and the second which are used after getting infected by the disease
 anek davaayen keval pratirodh yaa keval upachaar ke liye istemaal hoti hai, jabaki anya kai donon tarah se prayog main laai ja sakati hai
 Some drugs increase each other's effects and are used together
 pratirohak dawaaon kaa prayog aksar samuhik rup se hi kiya jaataa he
 Many medicines based on quinine are considered good treatment for malaria
 iske atirikt artimicinin jaisi aushadhiyaan, jo artimisia ennua naamak paudhe se taiyaar kii jaati he, malaria ke ilaaj main prabhavi pai gai hai
 Use of some other drugs has also been successful against malaria
 kuch aushadhiyon par prayog jari he
 The most prominent factor in the choice of medicine is that malaria parasites have developed resistance to which drugs in that area
 anek davaayen jinka prayog pehle malaria ke viruddh safal samajha jaataa tha aajkal safal nahin samajha jaataa kyon ki malaria ke paraseete dhire dhire unke prati pratirohak kshamta praapt kar chuke hai
 Malaria treatment is available in homeopathy, although many physicians believe that serious diseases like malaria should be treated with allopathic medicines, as they are based on scientific research
 yahan tak ki british homeopathic association kii salaah yahi he ki malaria ke upachaar ke liye homeopathy par nirbhar nahin karnaa chahie
 In Ayurveda, malaria is called anomalous fever and many medicines are available for its treatment
 yadhyapi malaria ke aaj prabhavi upachaar uplabdh he, lekin vishwa ke anek avikisit kshetron main malaria peedit kshetron main yaa to yah miltaa nahin hai yaa itnaa mahangaa hota he ki aam marij uskaa upyog nahin kar paata he
 In view of the increasing demand for malaria medicines, fake medicines are traded on a large scale in many affected countries, which causes many deaths
 aajkal companiyaan nai takneekon kaa prayog karke is samasya se nipatane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 The spread of malaria depends on these factors - the density of the human population, the density of the mosquito population, the spread from mosquitoes to humans and the spread from humans to mosquitoes
 in karkon main se kisi ek ko bhi bahut kam kar diya jaae to us kshetra se malaria ko mitaayaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, to prevent the spread of disease in malaria affected areas, along with medicines, measures are taken to eradicate mosquitoes or to avoid biting them
 anek anusandhan karta daawa karte hai ki malaria ke upachaar kii tulana me us se bachaav kaa vyay deergh kaal me kam rahegaa
 Extensive efforts were made to eradicate malaria globally in the decade 1956–1960
 kintu uname safalataa nahin mil saki or malaria aaj bhi africa me usee str par maujuud he
 Much control over malaria can be achieved by destroying mosquito breeding sites
 khadey pani main machhar apana prajnan karte hai, aise khadey pani kii jagahon ko dhak kar rakhana, sukha dena yaa baha dena chaiye yaa pani kii sataha par tel daal dena chaiye, jisase machharon ke larva saans na le paaen
 In addition, pesticides are often sprayed on the walls of homes in malaria-affected areas
 anek prajatiyon ke machhar manushya kaa khun chusane ke baad diwaar par baith kar ise hajam karte hai
 In such a situation, if insecticides are sprayed on the walls, the mosquito will die as soon as it sits on the wall, before any other humans are bitten
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne malaria prabhavit kshetron main chhidkav ke liye lagbhag 12 dawaaon ko manyata di he
 These include drugs such as permethrin and deltamethrin in addition to DDT, especially in areas where mosquitoes have developed anti-ddt resistance
 machhardaniyaan machharon ko logon se dur rakhane me safal rahati hai tathaa malaria sankraman ko kaaphi had tak rokatii hai

 Malaria-affected areas have seen a 20 percent reduction in malaria by spreading awareness about malaria
 saath hi malaria kaa nidaan or ilaaj jald se jald karne se bhi iske prasar main kami hoti he
 Other efforts include collecting and analyzing malaria on a large scale and examining how effective the methods of malaria control are
 aise ek vishleshan main pataa laga ki lakshan-viheen sankraman vaale logon kaa ilaaj karnaa bahut aavashyak hota he, kyonki inamen bahut maatra main malaria sanchit rahata he

 One of the single largest purposes for lubricants, such as motor oil, is the protection of internal combustion engines in motor vehicles and electrically operated devices
 aam taur par lubricant main 90% base oil or 10% se kam yojak hote hai
 Sometimes synthetic fluids like vegetable oil or hydrogen containing polyolefins, esters, silicones, fluorocarbons and many other synthetic liquids are used as base oils
 yojakon se kam gharshan or ghisaav, vardhit chipchipahat, unnat chipchipahat suchakank, zang or oxikaran ke prati pratirodh, kalprabhaavan yaa sandushan, aadi hota he
 Lubricants like 2-cycle oil are also added to some fuels

 Another approach to reduce friction and wear is the use of bearings such as ball bearings, roller bearings or air bearings, which in turn require internal lubrication, or in the case of acoustic lubrication, the use of sound
 audyogic anuprayogon ke alaava, lubricant kaa kai anya prayojanon ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Other uses include cooking, bio-medical purposes on humans, ultra-sound testing, internal testing for men and women, and the use of personal lubricants for sexual purposes

 Generally, the liquid lubricant operates in and out of the cooler part of the system, although lubricants may be used for heating and cooling when a controlled temperature is required
 This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that goes away in the unit at a given time
 ucch pravaah pranaliyaan bahut zyada garmi le ja sakati hai or lubricant par thermal tanaav ko kam karne kaa atirikt laabh bhi uthaa sakati he
 In this way low-cost liquid lubricants can be used
 praathmik dosha yah he ki ucch pravahon ke liye aam taur par vishaal haudi or bade shitalan ekakon kii aavashyaktaa he
 a minor drawback is that the high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure upon sudden system shutdown
 ek automotive oil-kuld terbo charger ek theth udhaaharan he
 Turbochargers become hot red during operation and the oil that cools them remains because their time in the system is very short ie high flow rate
 If the system is stopped abruptly, the oil in the turbo charger is immediately oxidized and will block the oil passages including deposits
 These deposits can completely block the oil passages, reducing cooling over time, resulting in a complete shutdown of the turbo charger, usually with jam bearings

 Lubricant transmission systems have the advantage of taking away internally generated debris and external contaminants coming into the system, which reach the filter from where they can be removed
 mashiinon ke liye lubricant jo niyamit rup se malbe yaa dooshit padaarth janit karte hai jaise ki automotive ingine, aam taur par inamen malba or dooshit padaarthon ko filter tak pahunchane or hataane ke liye disergent or chhitare hue yojak shaamil hote hai
 Over time the filter will fill up and need to be cleaned or replaced, so it is recommended that you change the oil filter while changing the oil in the car
 In closed systems such as gear boxes, the filter may include a magnet supplement to attract the fine iron shreds generated
