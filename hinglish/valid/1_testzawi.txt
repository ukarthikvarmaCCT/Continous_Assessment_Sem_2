 Ajanta Caves There are about 29 rock-cut Buddhist caves located in Maharashtra, India, which belong to the 2nd century BCE
 yahan buddha dharm se sambandhit chithran evam shilpkaaree ke utkrisht namoonay milte hai
 Live illustrations are also available with them
 yah guphaayen ajanta naamak gaanv ke sannikat hi sthit he, jo ki maharashtra ke aurangabad jile main he
 Ajanta Caves have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983
 " According to "national Geographic": The flow of faith was such that almost all Buddhist temples, including Ajanta for centuries, seem to have been built under the rule and shelter of Hindu kings
 guphaayen ek ghaney jangal se ghiri, ashv naal aakaar ghati main ajanta gaanv se 31‚ÅÑ2 kimi dur bani he
 The village is 106 km away from Aurangabad city of Maharashtra

 In the foothills of this valley, the hill stream Vaghur flows
 yahan kul 29 guphaayen hai, jo ki nadi dwaara nirmit ek prapaat ke dakshin main sthit he
 Their elevation from the river ranges from 35 to 110 feet
 ajanta kaa math jaisaa samooh he, jisamen kai vihaar evam chaityas grih hai, jo ki do charnon main bane hai
 The first phase is mistakenly called the Hinayana phase, which is related to the Hinayana faith of Buddhism
 vastutah hinayan sthaviravaad ke liye ek shabd he, jisamen buddha kii moort rup se koi nishedh nahin he
 Ajanta's cave numbers 9, 10, 12, 13 15A were discovered at this stage
 in khudaayiyon main buddha ko stupa yaa math rup main darshit kiya gaya he
 Second phase excavations were discovered after nearly three centuries of stability
 is charan ko bhi galat rup main mahayan charan 9 buddha dharm kaa doosraa bada dhada, jo ki kamatar kattar he, evam buddha ko sidhe gaay aadi rup main chitron yaa shilpon main darshit karne kii anumati detaa he
 ) Many people call this phase Vakataka phase
 yah vatsagulm shakha ke shasit vansh vaakatak ke naam par he
 The construction date of this second phase is disputed among many academics
 haal ke varshon main kuch bahumat ke sanket ise paanchavin shatabdi main maanane lage hai
 According to Walter M
 Spink, an Ajanta expert, the Mahayan caves were built between 462‚Äì480 AD
 mahayan charan kii guphaayen sankhya hai 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, evam 29
 Cave number 8 was considered a cave of Hinayana phase for a long time, but at present it has been declared as Mahayan on the basis of facts
 mahayan, hinayan charan main do chaityagrih mili the, jo gupha sankhya 9 va 10 main the
 The cave numbers of this phase are 12, 13, 15 viharas
 mahayan charan main teen chaityas grih the jo sankhya 19, 26, 29 main the
 From the very beginning, the last cave was uninhabited
 anya sabhi mili guphaayen 1-3, 5-8, 11, 14-18, 20-25, va 27-28 vihaar hai
 The viharas found in the excavation are of several sizes, the largest being 52 feet, almost all square
 inke rup main bhi bhinnata he
 Many are simple, many are ornate, some are made of pavilions, and many are not
 sabhi viharon main ek aavashyak ghatak he‚Äî ek vrahat haul cameraa
 Among the Vakataka stages, many have not had holy places, because they were made only for religious gatherings and accommodation; Later holy places were added to them
 phir to yah ek maanak ban gaya
 The statue of Buddha in a central hall in this sacred place was often seated in the dharma-chakra-pramana posture
 jin gufaaon main naveenatam visheshtaayen hai, vahaan kinare kii deevaaron, dwaar mandapon par or praangan main gaun pavitra sthal bhi bane dikhte hai
 The walls of many viharas are decorated with carvings
 deevaaron or chhaton par bhitti chithran kiya hua he
 With the difference in Buddhist thought in the first century, Buddha was given the status of a deity and worshiped him
 parinamtah buddha ko puja-archana kaa kendra banaaya gaya; jisase mahayan kii utpatti hui
 In the past, academics divided the caves into three groups, but were rejected due to evidence and research
 us siddhanth ke anusaar 200 i purv se 200 i tak ek samooh, dwitiya samooh chhathi shatabdi kaa or tritiy samooh saatvin shatabdi kaa mana jaataa tha
 The expression cave temple used by the anglo-indians for the viharas was considered inappropriate
 ajanta ek prakaar kaa mahavidhyalay math tha
 Hiuen Tsang states that Dinnag, a famous Buddhist philosopher, philosopher who was the author of several texts on logic, lived here
 yah abhi anya saakshyon se pramanit hona shesh he
 At its peak, the Viharas had the ability to accommodate hundreds
 yahan shikshak or chaatr ek saath rahete the
 It is very sad that no cave of Vakataka stage is complete
 yah is kaaran hua ki shaasha vaakatak vansh ekaek shaktiviheen ho gaya, jisase uski praja bhi sankat main aa gayi
 Due to this, all activities were interrupted and stopped suddenly
 yah samay ajanta kaa antim kaal rahaa
 This is a first step and has no meaning in the sequence of other caves
 yah ashwanal aakaar kii dhaal par purvi ore se pratham gupha he
 According to Spink one of the last caves built at this site is towards the end of the Vakataka phase
 haalaanki koi shilalekhith sakshya upasthit nahin hai; phir bhi yah mana jaataa he ki vaakatak raja harisena is uttam sangrakshit gupha ke sangrakshak rahe hon
 The main reason for this is that Harisena was not initially involved in the protection of Ajanta, but could not stay away from them for a long time, because this site was full of activities during his reign and his Buddhist subjects were given this sacred work of that Hindu king
 Could be happy to shelter
 yahan darshit kai vishay rajsik hai
 This cave has very elaborate carving work, which also has many highly embossed crafts
 yahan buddha ke jivan se sambandhit kai ghatnaayen ankit hai, saath hi anek alankaran namoonay bhi hai
 Its two-storied gate-pavilion, which was visible until the nineteenth century, is now extinct
 is gupha ke aage ek khulaa sthaan tha, jiske donon ore khambhedaar galiyare the
 Its level was relatively high
 iske dwaar mandap ke donon ore kothiyaan hai
 The absence of the pillared cells at the end suggests that this pavilion was not built with the last phase of Ajanta, when the pillared cells had become a regular part
 porch kaa adhikansh kshetra kabhi muraal se bharaa rahaa hoga, jiske kai avshesh abhi bhi shesh hai
 There are three gateways here, one central and two sideways
 in dwarpathon ke bich do vargakar khidkiyaan taraashi hui he, jinase antas ujjwalit hota tha
 Each wall of the hall is about 40 feet long and 20 feet high
 baarah stambh andar ek vargakar coloned banaate hai jo chat ko sahaara dete hai, saath hi deevaaron ke saath-saath ek galiyara-sa banaate hai
 a gargantuan image is carved on the back wall, in which the Buddha is shown seated in his dharma-chakra-vimana posture
 peeche, baayin evam daayin diwaar main chaar-chaar kamare bane hai
 These walls are full of paintings, which are in a perfect state of preservation
 darshit drishy adhiktar upadeshon, dharmik evam alankaran ke hai
 Their subjects are related to Jataka tales, life of Gautama Buddha, etc
 gupha sankhya 1 se lagi gupha san 2, deevaaron, chhaton evam stambhon par sangrakshit apni chitrakaari ke liye prasiddh he
 It looks very beautiful and looks almost similar to the cave number, but is in a far better state of conservation
 is gupha main do dwaar-mandap hai, jo ki sankhya 1 se bahut alag he
 Rather, the carving of the panels also looks different from that
 is gupha ko sahaara diye do achche khaase mote stambh hai, jo ki baari nakkashi se alankrita hai
 Yes, it definitely resembles the first cave in size, shape and land plan
 saamne kaa porch donon ore stambhon se yukt prakoshthon se yukt he
 Formerly, rooms made up of vacant spaces were necessary when the latter required space, as the latter increased the need for more accommodation

 vartmaan main yahan anek aise sthal maujuud hai jisase ise mahabharat se sambandhit mana ja saktaa he
 Idols of the five Pandavas, Dharmakup and Dharmakund in the name of Dharmaraja Yudhishthira are also famous here
 vishnu puraana ke anusaar yahan kamvan kii paridhi main chote-bade asankhya tirth hai
 Kamavan is known for its chaurasi kundas, chaurasi pillars and chaurasi temples

 kamyavan main saat darvaaze hai‚Äì Another inscription mentions the famous Sivayatana known as Kamyakeshwar in the Kaman
 is daan abhilekh se yah bhi gyaat hota he ki is mandir main shiv ke saath- saath vishnu evam chamunda aadi devataaon kii puja bhi hoti thi
 The statues of the major deities engraved around the Chaturmukh Shivling obtained from here also confirm this fact
 kamyakeshwar mandir main 786 or 896 i

 a business is a legally recognized institution created with the goal of providing a product or service to consumers
 vyavsaay ko 'company', 'interprise' yaa 'form' bhi kehete hai
 Business has a prominent place in the capitalist economies which are mostly in private hands and work with the aim of making profit and at the same time increase the business itself
 kintu sahakaari sansthaayen tathaa sarkaar dwaara chalaayi jaani vaali sansthaaen praaia: laabh ke bajaay anya uddeshyon kii purti ke liye banaayi gayi hoti hai
 We live in a commercial environment
 yah samaaj kaa ek anivaary ang he
 It fulfills our needs by providing a wide variety of goods and services through a wide network of business functions
 anya shabd - vyapaar, vyavsaay-pratishthan, form, dhandha, vyavsaay, karbar, kaarobaar, kaam-kaaj, kaam-dhandha, udhyam When we pay attention to our surroundings, we see that most people are engaged in some work
 adhyaaapak vidyalayon main padhaate hai, kisaan kheton main kaam karte hai, majdoor kaarkaanon main kaam karte hai, chaalak gaadiyaan chalaate hai, dukandaar saamaan bechate hai, chikitsak rogiyon ko dekhte hai aadi
 In this way every man is busy with some work all day, or sometimes overnight
 lekin ab prashn yah uthta he ki ham sab is tarah kisi na kisi kaam main apane aapako itnaa vyast kyon rakhte hai? iskaa sirf ek hi uttar he - 'apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye'
 By working in this way, we either fulfill our various responsibilities or earn money, so that we can buy the goods and services we need
 manushya dwaara kii jane vaali vibhinn kriyaayein maanviya kriyaayein kehalaati hai
 We can divide all these actions into two categories - jo kriyaayein dhan arjeet karne ke uddeshy se kii jaati hai, unhen aarthik kriyaayein kehete hai
 For example, the farmer grows the crop by plowing the field and earns money by selling it, the factory or office worker receives salary or wages in exchange for his work, the merchant earns profit from the sale and purchase of goods
 ye sabhi kriyaayein aarthik hai
 Activities that are performed for the purpose of achieving satisfaction, rather than earning money, are called uneconomical actions
 is tarah kii kriyaayein, saamaajik uttardayitvon kii purti, manoranjan yaa swasthya laabh ke liye kii jaati hai
 People visit places of worship, donate to a flood or earthquake relief fund, engage themselves in sports for health benefits, do gardening, listen to radio, watch television or perform other activities
 ye kuch udhaaharan anaarthik kriyaaon ke hai
 Economic activities are usually carried out for the purpose of earning money
 sadhrantaya log is tarah kii kriyaaon main niyamit rup main sanlagn hote hai, jise aarthik kriya kaha jaataa he
 Business can be defined as: vyavsaay kii nimnlikhit visheshtaayen hoti hai : The cultural heritage of India is very rich
 lekin shaayad yah bahut kam log jaanate honge ki pracheen kaal main bharat, arthvyavastha tathaa vyavsaay ke str par bahut hi viksit desh tha
 This is evident from historical evidence, evidence from excavations, literature and written documents
 in sabase adhki bharat kii aseem dhan sampatti se aakarshith hokar vibhinn videshi akramanakariyon dwaara samay-samay par hue akraman bhi is tathy ko pramanit karte hai
 Ancient Indian civilization was not only based on prosperity, but its internal and external trade and commerce were also very advanced
 vyavsaayik jagat ke vibhinn kshetron main bharat kaa aseem yogadan he
 On comparing it with the occupations prevailing in other countries of the time, we find that Indian business was far ahead in its singularity, mobility (dynamic) and quality
 shuru ke dinon main bhartiya arthvyavastha purnatah krishi adhrith thi
 People used to produce their consumption items themselves
 vastuon ko bechney athwa vinimay kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin thi
 But with the development, the needs of the people started increasing
 jiske kaaran vastuon ke utpaadan main bhi vrudhi hone lagi
 People began to specialize in the production of various items of daily use and luxury, and thus they lacked the nature and scope of business and efficiency to produce other items of their use
 is prakaar inaki kushalta main vrudhi hone lagi or ye apni aavashyaktaa se adhki vastuon kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 Hence, to meet their other requirements, a system of exchange of their overproduced goods developed
 yah vyapaar kii shuruuaat thi
 Today, most people believe that much development in the field of business and trade in India has taken place only after attaining independence
 bharat, aaj audyogic utpaadan main itnaa sakasham ho gaya he ki ham sabhi vastuon kaa utpaadan deshi takanic ke prayog se kar sakate hai
 But it should not be taken from this that Indian civilization was not developed or advanced in the past
 jabaki hamen aaj bhi bharat kii samrudhi vyapaarik va vanijyik dhrohar par garv he
 You will be surprised to know that India started its journey in the field of trade and commerce 5000 years BC
 Had started kai aitihaasik saakshyon se yah pramanit hota he ki us samay bharat main suniyojit shahar the
 There was a worldwide fascination for Indian clothing, jewelery and perfumes etc
 yah bhi pramaan mili hai ki kaaphi samay se bhartiya vyapaariyon main vyavsaay ke liye mudra ke prayog kaa chalan tha
 Unions were popularized to protect the interests of traders, craftsmen and producers
 yah bharat main vyapaar va vaanijya ke jatil vikaas kii ore sanket karata he
 The merchants of India at that time not only weaved a network of strong internal trade routes, but also had commercial connections with merchants from Arabia, Central and South East Asia
 bharat vibhinn prakaar kii datu saamagree ke utpaadan main bhi sakriy tha, jaise tamba, pital kii vasteen, bartan, gahane tathaa sajaavati saamaan aadi
 Indian traders exported their products to different parts of the world and imported their products from there
 yah ek sarvavidit tathy he ki angrej sarvapratham bharat main vyapaar karne ke liye hi aae the, jinhone baad main yahaan apana rajya sthapit kar liya
 India has contributed to world trade and commerce in many ways
 gananaa ke liye ank pranali, jiskaa ham aaj bhi upyog karte hai, bharat main pehle se viksit thi
 Joint family practice and division of labor in business also developed here, which is prevalent till date
 aaj aadhnik samay main prayog kii jane vaali upabhokta kendrit vyavsaay takanic puraane samay se bhartiya vyavsaay kaa ek abhinn ang rahi he
 Therefore we can say that India has its own rich commercial heritage, which has contributed significantly to its growth
 sabhi vyavsaayik kriyaayein kuch uddeshyon kii purti ke liye kii jaati hai
 Business objectives can be classified as follows: vyavsaay ke aarthik uddeshyon ke antargat laabh kamaane ke uddeshy ke saath ve samast aavashyak kriyaayein bhi aati hai, jinke dwaara laabh kamaane ke uddeshy kii purti kii jaati he, jaise graahak bananaa, niyamit nav pravartan tathaa uplabdh sansadhano kaa behatar upyog aadi
 Profit serves as the life force for business
 iske bina koi bhi vyavsaay pratiyogita ke bazaar main tikaa nahin rah saktaa
 In fact, the purpose of any business entity coming into existence is profit making
 laabh, vyavsaayee ko na keval uski aajeevika arjeet karne main sahaayta karata he, apitu laabh kaa ek bhaag vyavsaay main punah viniojit kar vyavsaayik gatividhyin ke vistaar main bhi sahaayak hota he
 Following are some other objectives of the business to achieve the primary objective of making profit: saamaajik uddeshy vyavsaay ke ve uddeshy hote hai, jinhen samaaj ke hiton ke liye praapt karnaa aavashyak hota he
 Therefore, the aim of every business should be to not harm the society in any way
 vyavsaay ke saamaajik uddeshyon ke antargat acchhee gunvattta vaali vastuon tathaa sevaaon kaa utpaadan tathaa purti, uchit vyapaarik prathaen apnaanaa, samaaj ke saamaanya kalyankari kaaryon main yogadan tathaa kalyankari suvidhaon main yogadan karnaa sammilit he
 Human purposes mean those objectives which have the goals of the welfare of the disabled and the disabled, deprived of education or training and fulfillment of the expectations of the employees
 is prakaar vyavsaay ke maanviya uddeshyon ke antargat karmchaariyon kii aarthik suraksha, saamaajik tathaa manovaigyanik santushti or maanav sansadhano kaa vikaas nihit he
 Business is an important part of the country, so the achievement of national goals and aspirations should be the objective of every business
 vyavsaay ke rashtriya uddeshy nimnlikhit hai: Earlier India had very limited trade relations with other countries
 tab vastuon kii aayaat or niryaat sambandhi nitiyaan bahut kathor thim, lekin aajkal udaaravaadi aarthik nitiyon ke kaaran kaaphi had tak videshi nivesh par pratibandh samaapt ho chukaa he, tathaa aaayaatit vastuon par lagane vaala shulk bhi kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 These changes have increased competition in the market
 aaj vaishvikaran ke kaaran puri duniya ek bade bazaar ke rup main parivartit ho chuki he
 Today, finished goods are easily available in one country
 is prakaar vishwa bazaar main pratispardhaa badhane se prayek vyavsaay apane mastishk main kuch uddeshy rakhkar kaam karne laga he, jise vaishvik uddeshy kaha ja saktaa he
 People run businesses with the aim of making a profit
 lekin keval laabh arjeet karnaa hi vyavsaay kaa ekmaatra uddeshy nahin hota
 Being a part of society, it also has to do a lot of social work
 yah vishesh rup se apane astitv kii suraksha main sanlagn swaamiyon, niveshkon, karmchaariyon tathaa saamaanya rup se samaaj vyavsaay kii prakruti tathaa kshetra va samudaay kii dekharekh kii jimmedaari bhi nibhaataa he
 Therefore, every business should bear responsibilities towards them in one way or the other
 udhaaharan ke liye, niveshkon ko uchit pratifal kii dar kaa aashwaasan dena, apane karmchaariyon ko acha vetan, suraksha, uchit kaary dashaayen uplabdh karana, apane graahakon ko acchhee gunvattta vaali vastuen uchit mulyon par ulabdh karana, paryaavaran kii suraksha karnaa tathaa isi prakaar ke anya bahut se kaary karne chahie
 While doing such work, two things should be specially taken care of for sustaining the social responsibilities of the business
 pehali to yah ki aisi prayek kriya rdhmarth kriya nahin hoti
 This means that if a business donates some money to a hospital or temple or a school or college, it will not be called its social responsibility, because donating does not discharge social responsibilities
 duusari baat yah he ki, is tarah kii kriyaayein kuch logon ke liye acchhee or kuch logon ke liye buree nahin honi chahie
 Suppose a businessman earns a lot of money by smuggling or shoving his customers and runs a hospital for free treatment of the poor, then his work is not socially justified
 saamaajik uttardaayitv kaa arth he ki ek vyavsaayee saamaajik kriyaaon ko sampann karte samay aisa kuch bhi na kare, jo samaaj ke liye hanikaarak ho
 Thus the concept of social responsibility encourages the businessman to earn profit through prudent management in lieu of unfair trade practices like hoarding and black marketing, tax evasion, adulteration, expulsion of customers
 yah karmchaariyon ko uchit kaary tathaa awasaiya suvidhen pradaan karke, graahakon ko utpaada vikray uparaant uchit sevaayen pradaan karke, paryaavaran pradooshan ko niyantrit karke tathaa prakritik sansadhanon kii suraksha dwaara sambhav he
 Having learned about the concept of social responsibility of the business and its importance, let us find out what the business has responsibilities towards its various interest groups on which it is dependent
 vyavsaay praayah swaamiyon, vinieveshkon, karmchaariyon, purtikartaaon, graahakon tathaa upabhoktaaon, pratiyogiyon, sarkaar tathaa samaaj par ashrith he
 These are called interest groups because the interests of these groups are directly or indirectly affected by each action of the business
 vyavsaay ke apane swaamiyon ke prati uttardaayitv hai : The business has responsibilities to its creditors: vyavsaay ke apane karmchaariyon ke prati nimnlikhit uttardaayitv hai : Following are the responsibilities of the business to its suppliers: graahakon ke prati vyavsaay ke uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : The business has the following responsibilities towards its competitors: sarkaar ke prati vyavsaay ke vibhinn uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : a society consists of individuals, groups, organizations, families etc
 ye sabhi samaaj ke sadsy hote hai
 All of them are similar with each other and depend on each other for almost all their activities
 in sabhi ke bich ek sambandh hota he, chaahe vah pratyaksh ho yaa apratyaksh
 Being a part of society, business should also help in maintaining relations between the members of the society
 iske liye use samaaj ke prati kuch nishchit uttardayitvon kaa nirvaah karnaa aavashyak he
 These responsibilities are as follows: kherwaal sorain santali bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar hai

 yamuna bharat kii ek nadi he
 It is the largest tributary of the Ganges River which originates from a place called Yamunotri and joins the Ganges at Prayag
 isaki pramukh sahaayak nadiyon main chambal, senger, choti sindh, batawa or ken ullekhneey hai
 Apart from Delhi and Agra, Etawah, Kalpi, Hamirpur and Prayag are the main cities of Yamuna
 prayag main yamuna ek vishaal nadi ke rup main prastut hoti he or vahaan ke prasiddh aitihaasik kile ke neeche ganga main mil jaati he
 Yamuna has an important place in the culture of Braj
 yah yamunotri naamak jagah se nikalati he
 It is the largest tributary of the Ganges River
 yamuna kaa udgam sthaan himalay ke himachhadit shrang bandarpuchh oonchaai 6200 meter se 7 se 8 mile uttar-pashchim main sthit kalind parvat he, jiske naam par yamuna ko kalindja athwa kalindi kaha jaataa he
 For several miles ahead of its origin, its stream flows uninterruptedly across the huge glaciers and snow-capped tubers and descends very steeply from the mountain slopes, manifested by the Yamunotri mountain
 vahaan iske darshanath hajaaron shraddhalu yatri prativarsh bharat varsh ke kone-kone se pahonchte hai
 Coming out of the Yamunotri mountain, this river flows in many mountainous rates and valleys and continues to cover small mountainous rivers like Vadier, Kamalad, Vadri Aslaur, and Tons in its zone
 uske baad yah himalay ko chhod kar doon kii ghati main pravesh karti he
 It flows for several miles southwest from there and takes small rivers called Giri, Sirmaur and Asha in its lap, it comes to the ground near Faizabad village in the present Saharanpur district, about 95 miles from its origin
 us samay iske tat tak kii oonchaai samudr sataha se lagbhag 1276 feet rah jaati he
 Bhuvanabhaskar Surya his father, Yama, the god of death, his brother and Lord Krishna, her husband have been accepted
 jahaan bhagwaan shri krishna braj samskruti ke janak kahe jate hai, vahaan yamuna isaki janani maani jaati he
 Thus she is the mother of Brajwasis in the true sense
 atah braj main ise yamuna maiyaa kehete he
 In the Brahma Purana, the explanation of the spiritual form of the Yamuna is presented - "the basis of creation and what is called the Sachchidananda Swarupa from the Lakshnas, the Upanishads who have sung in the Brahman form, the ultimate reality is Sakshata Yamuna
 gaudiy vidwaan shri rup goswami ne yamuna ko saakshaat chidanandmayi batalaaya he
 The Garga Samhita mentions the Pachang of Yamuna - 1
 Patal, 2
 Vedhi, 3
 Kavya, 4
 Stotra and 5
 Sahastra
 pashchimi himalay se nikal kar uttar pradesh evam haryana kii seemaa ke sahare 95 mile kaa safar kar uttari saharanpur pahunchati he
 Then it joins the Ganges River in Allahabad via Delhi, Agra
 yamuna nadi kii ausat gaharaai 10 feet or adhiktam gaharaai 35 feet tak he
 In the river near Delhi, this maximum depth is 68 feet
 agra main, yah gaharaai 3 foot tak hai
 Where there is a flow of Yamuna in the field at this time, it has not always flowed
 puranic anushrutiyon or aitihaasik ullekhon se yah gyaat hota he, yadhyapi yamuna pichley hajaaron varshon se vidhman he, tathaapi iskaa pravaah samay-samay par parivartit hota rahaa he
 Of the many places it has changed during its good life, only a small amount of information has been received
 pragaaitihaasik kaal main yamuna madhuban ke sameep bahati thi, jahaan uske tat par shatrughan ji ne sarvapratham mathura nagari kii sthapana kii thi
 Its details are found in Valmiki Ramayana and Vishnu Purana
 1 krishna kaal main yamuna kaa pravaah katra keshav dev ke nikat tha
 European scholar Tavernier, who visited India in the seventeenth century, had observed by looking at the land near Katra that it was once a stream of Yamuna
 is sandarbh main grouz kaa mat he ki aitihaasik kaal main katra ke sameep yamuna ke pravaahit hone kii sambhaavna kam he, kintu atyant pracheen kaal main vahaan yamuna avashya thi
 2 It also proves that during the Krishna period, the flow of Yamuna was close to Katra
 kanidham kaa anumaan he, yannani lekhakon ke samay main yamuna kii pradhan dhara yaa uski ek badi shakha katra keshav dev kii purvi diwaal ke neeche bahati hogi
 3 Jav went on extensive propagation of Buddhism in Mathura and here many sandharams were built on both sides of the Yamuna, the main stream of Yamuna would flow from Katra to the place where it is now, but there is no branch or subsidiary Katra
 Was also present near aisa anumaan he, yamuna kii vah shakha buddha kaal ke bahut baad tak sambhawatah solahavin shatabdi tak keshav dev mandir ke neeche bahati rahi thi
 The first two rainy rivers 'saraswati' and 'krishna Ganga' flow into the western part of Mathura and fall into the Yamuna, which commemorates the Saraswati Sangam of the Yamuna and the ghat called Krishna Ganga
 sambhav he yamuna kii un sahaayak naadiyon main se hi koi katra ke paas bahati rahi ho
 It is known from the talk literature of Vallabh sect that the river Yamuna used to flow near Jamunavati village in Saraswat Kalpa
 us kaal main yamuna nadi kii do dharaain thi, ek dhara nandagaanv, varasanaa, sanket ke nikat bahati hui govardhan main jamunaavati par aati thi or duusari dhara pirghat se hoti hui gokul kii ore chali jaati thi
 Further, both streams used to move towards present Agra
 parasauli main yamuna ko dhara pravaahit hone kaa pramaan sa
 1717 tak miltaa he
 Although it is hard to believe
 shri gangaaprasad kamthaan ne brajabhasha ke ek musalmaan bhakt kavi karbeg upmaan kaare kaa vrutant prakashit kiya he
 According to Kabeg's statement, he was a resident of village Parasauli on the banks of the Jamuna and had created his work in 1717
 vartmaan samay main saharanpur jile ke faijabad gaanv ke nikat maidan main aane par yah aage 65 mile tak badhati hui haryana ke ambala or karnal jilon ko uttar pradesh ke saharanpur or mujffarnagar jilon se alag karti he
 In this terrain, rivers named Mascara, Kath, Hindon and Sabi are found, due to which its size increases greatly
 maidan main aate hi isse purvi yamuna nahar or pashchimi nahar nikaali jaati hai
 Both these canals take water from Yamuna and make the earth green and rich in hundreds of miles of this land
 is bhu-bhaag main yamuna kii dhara ke donon ore punjab or uttar pradesh ke kai chote bade nagaron kii seemayen hai, kintu iske thik tat par basaa hua sabase pracheen or pehla nagar dilli he, jo lambe samay se bharat kii rajdhani he
 It reaches a place called Okhla, catering to the needs of millions of male and female residents of Delhi and sweeping away the filth
 yahan par is par ek bada baandh baandha gaya he jisase nadi kii dhara puri tarah niyantrit kar lee gayi he
 From this dam comes the Agra Canal, which irrigates hundreds of miles of land in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh
 dilli se aage yah haryana or uttar pradesh kii seemaa banaati hui tathaa haryana ke faridabad jile ko uttar pradesh ke gajiabad jile se alag karti hui uttar pradesh main pravaahit hone lagati he
 The first entry of Yamuna river into the cultural boundary of Braj region is near the town called 'jaber' of Khurja tehsil of Bulandshahar district
 vahaan se yah dakshin kii ore bahati hui faridabad jile kii palaval tehsil or aligarh, uttar pradesh ke hathras jile kii khayr tehsil kii seemaa nirmit karti he
 It then enters Mathura district near Shahpur village of Umbrella Tehsil and sets the boundary of Umbrella and Bhatt Tehsils of Mathura District
 jebar se shergarh tak yah dakshinabhimukh pravaahit hoti he uske baad kuch purv kii ore mud jaati he
 Shergarh is the first notable place situated on the banks of Yamuna in the Braj region
 shergarh se kuch dur tak purv kii disha main bah kar phir yah mathura tak dakshin disha main hi bahati he
 On both sides of the route, Puranas are famous forest and park and Krishna Leela place
 yahan par yah bhant se vrindavan tak bal khaati hui bahati he or vrindavan ko yah teen ore se gher leti he
 It is known from the Puranas, in ancient times there were many streams of Yamuna in Vrindavan, due to which it became almost like a peninsula
 usamen anek sundar vankhand or ghaas ke maidan the, jahaan bhagwaan shri krishna apane saathi gop baalkon ke saath gaayen charaaya karte the
 In the present day there is only one stream of Yamuna and Vrindavan is situated on its banks
 vahaan madhya kaal main anek dharmacharyon or bhakt kaviyon ne nivas kar krishnopasna or krishna bhakthi kaa prachaar kiya tha
 There are large beautiful ghats on the banks of the Yamuna in Vrindavan and there are many temples-shrines, chhatris and dharamshalas on them
 inase yamuna ke tat kii shobhaa adhik bad jaati he
 Flowing further south from Vrindavan, this river enters the city of Mathura
 mathura yamuna ke tat par basaa hua ek esa aitihaasik or dharmik sthaan he, jisaki dirghakalin gaurav gaatha prasiddh he
 Here Lord Krishna took an avatar, due to which its importance has increased
 yahan bhi yamuna ke tat par bade sundar ghat bane hue hai
 a panoramic view of Mathura city and its ghats is seen in Yamuna by boat or by bridge
 mathura main yamuna par do pakke pul bane hai jinamein se ek par railgadee chalati he tathaa duusare par sadak parivahan chalate hai
 Gokul barrage has now also been constructed on the southern border of Mathura city with the objective of bringing back the ground water level of Braj and making the fertile land of Braj more and more irrigated
 vigat kaal main yamuna mathura-vrindavan main ek vishaal nadi ke rup main pravaahit hoti thi, kintu jabase isse naharen nikaali gayi hai, tab se iskaa jaleey aakaar chota ho gaya he
 It takes its predecessor form only in rain
 us samay milon tak iskaa pani fail jaataa he
 Further from Mathura, on the left bank of the Yamuna there are religious places like Gokul and Mahavan and on the right bank there are villages like Aurangabad and Farah
 yahan tak yamuna ke kinare retile hai, kintu aage patharile or chattaani ho jate hai, jisase jal dhara bal khaati hui manoram rup main pravaahit hoti he
 The Yamuna near the village of Akos in Sadabad tehsil runs out of the boundary of Mathura district and then forms the boundary of Mathura and Agra districts to some extent
 sadabad tehsil ke mandaur gram ke paas yah agra jile main pravesh karti he
 There, rivers called Karban and Gambhir come together
 agra jile main pravesh karne par nagala akos ke paas iske pani se nirmit keetham jhil he, jo sailaaniyon ke liye badi aakarshak he
 a protected forest block has been constructed along the banks of the Yamuna from Keetham to Runkata, which is called 'surdas Forest'
 runakta ke sameep hi yamuna tat par 'goghaat' kaa vah pracheen dharmik sthal he, jahaan mahatma surdaas ne 12 varshon tak nivas kiya tha or jahaan unhone mahaprabhu ballabhacharya se diksha lee thi
 Among the coastal places of Yamuna, Agra is the largest city after Delhi
 yah ek prasiddh aitihaasik, vyapaarik env paryaton sthal he, jo mughal samraaton kii rajdhani bhi rah chukaa he
 It is situated at a great height from the Yamuna coast - Yamuna flows in the eastern part of Delhi, from north to south
 yahan par bhi yamuna par do pul nirmit hai
 The buildings on the Yamuna coast in Agra, the fort built by the Mughal emperors and the Taj Mahal are very famous for tourists
 agra nagar se aage yamuna ke ek ore firozabad or duusari ore fatehbaad jila or tehsil sthit he
 After them comes the famous religious and historical site of Bateshwar, where the cultural boundary of Braj ends
 bateshwar kaa pracheen naam 'saurapur' he, jo bhagwaan shri krishna ke pitamah shur kii rajdhani thi
 Here, the Yamuna has taken a big turn with force, making Bateshwar known as an island
 is sthaan par karthik poornama ko yamuna snaan kaa ek bada mela lagata he
 Beyond Bateshwar, Etawah is situated on the banks of the Yamuna as a city
 yah bhi agra or bateshwar kii bhanti oonchaai par basaa hua he
 The high banks on the banks of the Yamuna are not in the plain as much as in the districts of Agra and Etawah
 itawa se aage madhya pradesh kii prasiddh nadi chambal yamuna main aakar milti he, jisase iskaa aakaar visteern ho jaataa he, apane udgam se lekar chambal ke sangam tak yamuna nadi, ganga nadi ke samaanaantar bahati he
 Further, the difference between them becomes less and in the end they go to Prayag and they both get confluent
 chambal ke pashchaat yamuna nadi main milane vaali nadiyon main senger, choti sindh, batawa or ken ullekhneey hai
 After Etawah, Kalpi, Hamirpur and Prayag are the main towns of the Yamuna
 prayag main yamuna ek vishaal nadi ke rup main prastut hoti he or vahaan ke prasiddh aitihaasik kile ke neeche ganga main mil jaati he
 a huge bridge has been built over the Yamuna at Prayag, which is two storeyed
 ise uttar pradesh kaa vishaltam sethu mana jaataa he
 Due to the confluence of Yamuna and Ganga, Prayag has gained the importance of Tirtharaj
 yamuna nadi kii kul lambaai udgam se lekar prayag sangam tak lagbhag 860 mile he
 Yamuna is counted along with the Ganges in the most sacred and ancient rivers of India
 yamuna or ganga ke do aab kii punyabhumi main hi aaryon kii puraatan samskruti kaa gauravshaalee rup ban sakaa tha
 Yamuna is the only important river of Brajmandal

 Not only did Toynbee work his pen on ancient to modern history, he also wrote fiercely on religion, contemporary developments and the nature of history
 apane itihaas vishyak siddhanton kaa pratipaadan unhone apni kitaab a study of history main kiya he
 Scholars have considered this work to be similar to Oswald Spengler's work The Decline of the West
 darasal, spengler or tinabi samakaleen the
 Spangler wrote this work in his youth and Toynbee in his maturity
 donon main samanta is baat ko lekar rahi ki donon ne hi vishwa- itihaas ke adhyayan main sabhyataa ko centre main rakhaa tathaa apane adhyayan kii vishay-vastu banaaya
 Both of them divided the units of civilization
 spengler ne unki sankhya aath bataayi jabaki toinbi ne taees
 According to Spengler, civilizations go through different stages
 tinabi spengler ke is vichaar se bhinn mat rakhte hai, par donon is baat se sahamat hai ki pashchimi sabhyataa prashnaankit hone ke daur se guzar rahi he
 Toynbee is of the view that civilizations cannot be understood through disciplined study
 ve apane adhyayan ko anubhavashrith bataa hai
 They use various social sciences, including psychology, to say their things in the early parts of their work
 yah maanate ki vibhinn samskritiyaan ek-duusare ko prabhavit karti hai, toinbi spengler kii yah manyata asweekaar karte hai ki prayek sabhyataa alag-alag viksit hoti he or uske baad sabhyataaon kaa ant hota jaataa he
 Their fundamental idea is that the smallest comprehensible unit of historical study is the whole society, not part of a unilaterally determined part, such as the nation-states of the modern era or the city-states of the greek-roman era
 sabhyataa ke sandarbh main toinbi kaa vichaar he ki sabhi sabhyataaon kaa itihaas kuch nishchit sandarbhon main samaanaantar or samasamayik hota he
 Toynbee described Spengler's claims to be illogical in light of his concepts concerning the origins of civilizations
 sabhi sabhyataaon ke itihaas ko kuch nishchit sandarbhon main samaanaantar or samayik maanane kii samaj tinabi ne apane vidhyaarthiyon ko thucididis kaa itihaas padhaate hue banaayi thi
 The history of the Peloponnesian War, written by Thucydidis in 431 BC, was considered by Toynbee to be the period of the dissolution of Hellenic society
 toinbi ko padhaate samay laga ki jo anubhav ve 1914 kii ghatnaon se aadhunik vishwa ke paridrishy main kar rahe hai, yahi anubhav thucididis ne apane jamaane main kar liya tha
 On this basis, Toynbee underlined the contemporaryity of the two eras, terming his concept as modern and the era of Thucydidis as ancient
 isi samaj ko aadhaar banaakar toinbi ne unani-roman sabhyataaon kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa unke itihaas ko sabhyataaon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan ke pratimaan ke rup main grahan kiya
 According to Toynbee's critics, comparative studies of civilizations are possible in principle, but are practically impossible due to the unavailability of material
 toinbi ne apni is aalochana ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadhyapi kuch sthitiyon main prayek ‚Äòghatana‚Äô vilakshan or athulaneey he, lekin vah is sthiti main bhi kisi varg vishesh main aa sakati he
 No two living anatomy are the same, but in spite of this, the validity of zoology, botany and human sciences does not end
 toinbi apane samarthan main maanav jivan kii ghatnaon or apane vichaar binduon ko samajhane ke liye arestu kii teen paddatiyon kaa hawala diya : tathyon kaa sunishchitikaran or unka sangrah, tathyon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan dwaara kuch saamaanya niyamon kii vyakhya or ‚Äòkalpana‚Äô ke rup main tathyon kii kalatmak punarrachana
 Toynbee does not consider the origin and development of civilizations to be due to physical or geographical surroundings
 ise ve ek aparibhaashya tatva kaa parinaam maanate hai jo upree taur se manovaigyanik prakaar kaa he
 Explaining this, Toynbee takes the shelter of the Puranas and quotes Plato as saying that the simultaneous use of both science and myth is not undesirable
 ve puraanon kii bhashaa sunne ke liye vaigyanik-siddhant se apni ankhen band kar lene ke liye kehete hai
 According to him, there are many reasons for the origin of civilizations
 yah apane aap main koi astitv nahin ek sambandh he
 The creation is the result of the union of two supernatural individuals and their interactions
 har baar yah yojana ek purna bhinn rajya ke rup main faleebhoot hoti hai
 The reason for the origin of civilization on this basis is an interaction
 sabhyataa ke vikaas ke kram main toinbi kaa kahana he ki vyakti saamaajik varg ke rup main nirantar aane vaali chunautiyon kaa saamana karte hai jisase sabhyataa kaa vikaas hota he or yah kram prakriyaatmak rup main nirantar chalata rahata he
 In relation to the development and characteristics of civilization, the Tyanbi consider the development of military or social power not as a symptom of the development of civilization, but as a sign of the decline of civilization
 saamanytah bhautik vikaas ko sabhyataa kaa lakshan maane jane kii jagah ve aantarik prakriya ko hi sabhyataa kaa vikaas maan kar chalate hai
 According to him, self-determination is an essential condition for this
 iske vipareet spengler ke anusaar sabhyataa kaa vikaas jaivikeey siddhant par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran uskaa vighatan bhi anivaary ho jaataa he
 According to another opinion, species-based rituals are the root cause of the disintegration of civilization
 lekin toinbi prajatiyon se sabhyataa kaa koi sambandh nahin maanate
 There has also been a theory about the disintegration of civilization, that as civilization has risen, its dissolution and fall will also be certain
 toinbi ke anusaar sabhyataaon ke patan ke aadhaar unki bhavi kundalee banaayi ja sakati he
 According to him, the disintegration of civilization is not due to their being confined in a land area nor due to human birth or natural calamities
 sabhyataa kaa vighatan aatmghaat kii vajah se hota he
 They believe that loss of functional power in individuals is the root cause of the disintegration of civilization
 ise hi unhone aatmghaat kaha he
 Toynbee's view is that during the disintegration of civilization, society is divided into three hempes, such as the ruling minority, the internal proletariat and the external proletariat
 spengler ke vipareet toinbi nahin maanate ki vighatan ke baad sabhyataa samaapt ho jaati he
 Even after the dissolution of his view, these parts continue to achieve
 vighatan ke samay teenon bhaag nissartaa kii sthiti main nahin hote balki teenon hi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Toynbee believes that the suffering that man experiences due to the disintegration of civilization becomes a factor of progress
 arthath kathinaaiyaan hi aage badhanaa sikhaati hai

 1881 main, sarkaar ne apane pehle ke faisle ke khilaaf england kii oriental telephone company limited ko kolkata, mumbai, chennai or ahmedabad main telephone exange kholane ke liye ek license diya, jisase 1881 main desh main pehali aupchaarik telephone seva kii sthapana hui

 Even after independence, development was taking place at a very slow pace

 The number of telephones increased leisurely to 980,000 in 1971, 2
15 million in 1981 and 5
07 million in 1991, the year in which economic reforms were initiated in the country
 haalanki samay-samay par kuch abhinav kadam uthaaye ja rahe the, jaise ki udhaaharan ke liye 1953 main mumbai main telex seva or 1960 ke bich dilli or kanpur evam lakhanu or kanpur ke bich pehla maarg shuru kiya gaya, assi ke dashak main sam pitroda ne parivartan kii laharon kaa daur shuru kiya

 In 1975, the Department of Telecom was separated from P&T
 doorsanchaar vibhaag 1985 tak desh main sabhi doorsanchaar sevaaon ke liye jimmedaar tha, jab mahanagar telephone nigam limited ko doorsanchaar vibhaag se alag karke use dilli or mumbai kii sevaaon ko chalaane kii jimmedaari di gayi
 In the 1990s, the telecom sector was opened to private investment by the government under the liberalization-privatization-globalization policy
 isliye, sarkaar kii niti shakha ko uski karypalika shakha se alag karnaa jaruri ho gaya tha
 On 1 October 2000, the Government of India subordinated the operating portion of the Department of Telecommunications to the Corporation and named it Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited
 kai nijee operataron, jaise ki reliance communications, tata indicom, hach, loop mobile, airtel, idia aadi ne ucch sambhaavna vaale bhartiya doorsanchaar bazaar main safaltaapurvak pravesh kiya
 The Government of India was formed by several factions whose ideologies differed
 unamem se kuch videshi khilaadiyon ke liye bazaar khulaa rakhana chaahate the, jabaki anya chaahate the ki sarkaar buniyadi dhaanche ko viniyamit kare or videshi khilaadiyon kii bhagidaari ko simit rakhe
 is raajnneetik prishthbhumi ke kaaran doorsanchaar main udaarikaran laana bahut mushkil tha
 When a bill was passed in Parliament, it should have got a majority vote, but it was difficult to get such a majority given the number of parties with different ideologies
 udaarikaran 1981 main shuru hua jab pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne har saal 5,000,000 line lagaaye jane ke prayaas ke tahat france kii alcatel siaiti ke saath rajya sanchalit doorsanchaar company ke vilay ke anubandh par hastakshar kiya
 But this policy soon had to be abandoned due to political opposition

 There were many technological developments during this period, yet foreign players were not allowed to participate in the telecom trade

 It was during this period that in 1994 the government under the leadership of PN Rao implemented the National Telecom Policy, which brought changes in the following areas: ownership, service and regulation of telecommunications infrastructure

 Foreign companies were entitled to hold 49% of the total stake

 During this period, the World Bank and ITU had advised the Indian government to liberalize long-distance services to end the monopoly of the state-owned Department of Telecommunications and VSNL and increase competition in the long-distance carrier business thereby reducing tariffs
 It will help in improving the economy of the country
 The government run by Rao liberalized local services by taking the opposite political parties into confidence and after 5 years gave confidence to give foreign participation in long distance business
 The country was divided into 20 telecom circles for basic telephony and 18 circles for mobile services
 in parimandalon ko prayek parimandal main rajasav ke mulya ke aadhaar par e, bi or si shrenee main vibhajit kiya gaya
 The government kept open the tenders for one private company per circle along with state-owned Telecom Department per circle
 cellular seva ke liye prati parimandal main do seva pradaataaon ko anumati di jaati thi or har pradaata ko 15 saal kaa license diya jaataa tha
 During these reforms, the government faced protests from ITI, Department of Telecommunications, MTNL, VSNL and other labor unions, but managed to overcome these hurdles
 1995 ke baad sarkaar ne tri banaaya, jisane prashulk tay karne or nitiyon ko banane main sarkari hastkshep ko kam kar diya
 The Department of Telecommunications opposed it

 Domestic trade groups wanted the government to privatize VSNL
 aakhir main april 2002 main ant main, sarkaar ne viesanel main apni hissedari ko 53% se ghataakar 26% kar di or ise nijee udhyamon ko bikri ke liye aamantrit karne kaa faisla kiya
 In the end, Tata took a 25% stake in VSNL
 yah kai videshi niveshkon ke liye bhartiya doorsanchaar bazaar main shaamil hone ke liye ek pravesh dwaar jaisaa tha
 After March 2000, the government became more liberal in formulating policies and issuing licenses to private operators
 sarkaar ne aage cellular seva pradaataaon ke liye license shulk kam kar diya or videshi companiyon kii sweekaarya hissedari ko badhaakar 74% kar diya
 Because of all these factors, in the end the service charges were reduced and the cost of calls came down drastically, making it easier for every common middle class family in India to get a cell phone

 There are many methods of preserving botanical diversity, the most effective of which is to allow the plants to grow naturally in their ecology and preserve them by keeping them at their natural site - in this way plants protected by them Genetic purity remains, but rapid conservation of plants is not practical by this method, so genetic Shik diversity has to be conserved away from nature in botanical gardens, forest-trees and bio-fields

 == sandarbh == Linguistics is that branch of language study in which scientific and analytical study of the origin, nature, development, etc
 of the language is done
 bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayeta 'bhashavigyaani' kehalaate hai
 Linguistics is different from grammar
 vyakaran main kisi bhashaa kaa kaaryaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he jabaki bhashavigyaani iske aage jaakar bhashaa kaa atyant vyapak adhyayan karata he
 Among the many subjects of study, linguistics is being given special importance nowadays
 bhashaa-sambandhi is adhyayan ko europe main aaj tak anek naamon or sangyaaon se abhihit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Firstly this study was added a word as an adjective next to the word Philology - then it was called as "comparative Philology"
 unnisvin shatabdi tak vyakaran tathaa bhashaa-vishyak adhyayan ko praayah ek hi samajha jaataa tha
 Hence, scholars also named it 'comparative Grammar'
 france main isko langistik naam diya gaya
 The name "linguistique" or "linguistics" has been prevalent in the whole of Europe in the nineteenth century due to the greater language related work in France
 iske atirikt 'science of language', ‚Äòglautoleji‚Äô aadi anya naam bhi is vishay ko prakat karne ke liye kaam main aaye
 Of all these names, "linguistics", "philology" are used only today
 bharatvarsh main in sabhi europea naamon ke atirikt hindi bhashaa main jo naam prayog main laae jate hai ve is prakaar hai- ‚Äò‚Äòbhashaa-shaastra‚Äô‚Äô, ‚Äò‚Äòbhashaa-tatva‚Äô‚Äô, ‚Äò‚Äòbhashaa-vigyaan‚Äô‚Äô, tathaa ‚Äò‚Äòtulanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan‚Äô‚Äô aadi
 Among all these names, the most common name is "linguistics"
 in naam main pracheen or naveen sabhi naamon kaa samaahaar-sa hua jaan padataa he
 Therefore, this name seems to be suitable for this scripture
 apane vartmaan swaroop main bhashaa vigyaan pashchimi vidwaanon ke mastishk kii dein kaha jaataa he
 The trend of language-related studies is found in Sanskrit literature since very ancient times
 ‚Äòshiksha‚Äô naamak vedang main bhashaa sambandhi sookshm charchaa uplabdh hoti he
 Detailed description of the pronunciation of the sounds - elements, location, effort etc
 is available in these texts
 ‚Äòpraatishakhya‚Äô evam nirukt main shabdon kii vyutpatti, dhaatu, upsarg-pratyay aadi vishyon par vaigyanik vishleshan bhashaa kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kaha ja saktaa he
 Under Bhartrihari's book 'sentence Pad', subtle, deep and comprehensive thinking of the form of 'word' is available
 vahaan shabd ko ‚Äòbrahm‚Äô ke rup main pariklpit kiya gaya he or uski ‚Äòakshar‚Äô sangya bataai gai he
 It is, by default, a language-related book
 sanskrit-sahitya main darshan evam sahityashastreey granthon main bhi hamen ‚Äòshabd‚Äô ‚Äôarth‚Äô, ‚Äòras‚Äô ‚Äòbhav‚Äô ke sookshm vivechan ke antargat bhashaa vaigyanik charchaaon ke hi sanket praapt hote hai‚Äô sanskrit-sahitya main yatra-tatra uplabdh hone vaali bhashaa-vichaar-vishyak saamagree hi nishchit rup se vartmaan bhashaa-vigyaan kii aadharshila kahi ja sakati he
 Linguistics as a modern subject is thought to have originated in Europe in 1786 AD by a scholar named Sir William Jones
 sanskrit bhashaa ke adhyayan ke prasang main sar wiliam jones ne hi sarvapratham sanskrit, greek or latin bhashaa kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hue is sambhaavna ko vyakt kiya tha ki sambhawatah in teenon bhashaaon ke mul main koi ek bhashaa rup hi aadhaar bana hua he
 Therefore, there exists a subtle formula between these three languages
 bhashaaon kaa is prakaar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan hi aadhunaki bhashaa-vigyaan ke kshetra kaa pehla kadam bana
 Two terms have been used in the name "linguistics"
 ‚Äò‚Äòbhashaa‚Äô‚Äô tathaa ‚Äò‚Äòvigyaan‚Äô‚Äô
 Before understanding linguistics, it seems necessary to be familiar with both these words
 ‚Äòbhashaa‚Äô shabd sanskrit kii ‚Äò‚Äòbhash‚Äô‚Äô dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Which means - express speech
 ‚Äòvigyaan‚Äô shabd main ‚Äòvi‚Äô upsarg tathaa ‚Äògya‚Äô dhaatu se ‚Äòlut‚Äô pratyay lagane par banataa he
 In general, 'bhasha' means 'spoken language or dialect' and 'vigyan' means 'special knowledge', but only after understanding the clear and comprehensive meaning of these two terms used in the word 'linguistics'
 We will be able to know the essence of this name
 atah ham yahan in donon padon ke vistrut arth ko spasht karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Language: Human being is a social animal
 samaaj main apane bhaavon or vichaaron ko ek duusare tak pahunchane kii aavashyaktaa chirkaal se anubhav kii jaati rahi he
 Thus the existence of language proves to be very ancient in human society
 maanav ke sampoorn gyaan-vigyaan kaa prakaashan karne ke liye, sabhyataa or samskruti ke itihaas ko jaanane ke liye bhashaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan kaa kaary karti he
 We have come to know all the ordinary and extraordinary experiences from our ancestors through language
 hamaare sabhi sadgranthon or shastron se milane vaala gyaan bhashaa par hi nirbhar he
 Mahakavi Dandi has written in his great book 'kavyadarsha' informing the importance of language: - arthath yah sampoorn bhuwan andhkarpurn ho jaataa, yadi sansar main shabd-swaroop jyoti arthath bhashaa kaa prakaash na hota
 It is clear that this statement has been said to target human language
 pashu-pakshi bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye jin dhvaniyon kaa aashray lete hai ve unke bhaavon kaa vahan karne ke kaaran unke liye bhashaa ho sakati hai kintu maanav ke liye aspasht hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne use ‚Äòavyakt vaak‚Äô kaha he, jo bhashaa-vigyaan kii drushti se koi mahatva nahin rakhti
 Because in 'avyakta speech' both the words and meanings remain unclear
 manushya bhi kabhi-kabhi apane bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye ang-bhangima, bhru-sanchaalan, haath-paanv-mukhaakriti aadi ke sanketon kaa prayog karte hai parantu vah bhashaa ke rup main hote hue bhi ‚Äòvyakt vaak‚Äô nahin he
 The greatest feature of human language is that it is 'articulated speech', that is, having clarity of words and meanings
 mahabhashya ke rachayita patanjali ke anusaar ‚Äòvyakt vaak‚Äô kaa arth bhashaa ke varnanaatmak hone se hi he
 It is true that sometimes even with the help of signs and disguises, our sentiments and thoughts are transmitted very easily
 is prakaar ve cheshtaayen bhashaa ke pratik ban jaati hai kintu maanav bhaavon ko prakat karne kaa sabase upyukt saadhan vah varnanaatmak bhashaa he jise ‚Äòvyakt vaak‚Äô kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 In this, certain accented or perceived sounds are taken to reveal different meanings
 atah bhashaa ham un shabdon ke samooh ko kehete hai jo vibhinn arthon ke sanketon se sampann hote hai
 By whom we can easily reveal our feelings to others
 is prakaar bhashaa kii paribhaasha karte hue ham use maanav-samaaj main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa aadan-pradaan karne ke liye apanaaya jane vaala ek madhyam kah sakate hai jo maanav ke uccharan avyavon se prayatnpurvak nicksruth kii gai dhvaniyon kaa sarthak aadhaar liye rahata he
 Those phonemes take the form of words when they are attached to a meaning
 sampoorn dhwani-vyapaar arthath shabd-samooh apane arth ke saath ek ‚Äòyadrichhik‚Äô sambandh par aadhaarit hota he
 'random' means completely fictitious
 sankshep main vibhinn arthon main vyakt kiye gaye mukh se uccharit us shabd samooh ko ham bhashaa kehete hai jiske dwaara ham apane bhav or vichaar dusron tak pahunchaate hai
 We have many benefits from the study of linguistics, such as- 1
 apni chir-parichit bhashaa ke vishay main jigyaasa kii tripti yaa shankaaon kaa nirmulan
 2
 Introduction to historical and prehistoric culture
 3
 kisi jati yaa sampoorn maanavtaa ke maansik vikaas kaa parichay
 4
 Solution of many problems related to the meaning, pronunciation and use of ancient literature
 5
 vishwa ke liye ek bhashaa kaa vikaas
 6
 Assistance in learning foreign languages
 7
 anuwaad karne vaali tathaa swayan tip karne vaali evam isi prakaar kii mashiinon ke vikaas or nirmaan main sahaayta
 8
 Assistance in change in terms of simplicity, correctness etc
 in language, script etc
 in sabhi laabhon kii drushti se aaj ke yug main bhashaa-vigyaan ko ek atyant upyogi vishay mana ja rahaa he or uske adhyayan ke kshetra main nity naveen vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is a natural object that has been given to humans as a divine gift
 bhashaa kaa nirmaan manushya ke mukh se swaabhaavik rup main nicksruth dhvaniyon ke dwaara hota he
 The common knowledge of the language becomes available to all who speak and hear it
 yahi bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan kehalaata he
 Next, when did language become, how did it become? What was its initial and ancient form? When and what changes did it happen and what are the reasons for those changes? Or how did the language develop overall? What are the reasons for that development? Which language has so much similarity or dissimilarity with which other language? All this will be called special knowledge of language or 'linguistics'
 isi bhashaa-vigyaan ke vishesh rup arthath bhashaa vigyaan ko aaj adhyayan kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay maan liya gaya he
 When linguistics was included under the syllabus of large classes in the subjects of study, a natural question first arose whether linguistics should be counted under art or in science
 arthath bhashaa-vigyaan kala he athwa vigyaan he
 It was decided to take the process and conclusions of the study that in reality it should be considered as pure science like physics, and chemistry etc
 or to be accepted as art like painting, music, sculpture, poetry etc
 kala kaa sambandh maanav-jati vastuon yaa vishyon se hota he
 This is why art is individual or completely individual
 vyakti saapeksh hone ke saath-saath kisi desh vishesh or kaal-vishesh kaa bhi kala par prabhaav rahata he
 This means that in the period of time, the new changes are present in the values which remain towards art and it should not be accepted in any other country, it is also not necessary
 ek vyakti ko kisi vastu main ucch kalatmak abhivyakti lag rahi he
 But to others she does not look like this
 atah kala kii dharna prayek vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn hua karti he
 Art is related to the emotional instinct of the human heart
 usamen vyakti kii soundaryanubhuti kaa put mila rahata he
 The purpose of art is also to provide beauty, or to provide joy, not to do an elemental analysis of something
 kala ke swaroop kii in sabhi visheshtaon kii kasuti par parakhane se gyaat hota he ki bhashaa-vigyaan kala nahin he
 Because it is not related to the plausibility of the heart but to the philosophical view of the intellect
 bhashaa-vigyaan kaa uddeshy soundaryanubhuti karana yaa manoranjan karana bhi nahin he
 That makes our intellectual thinking sharp
 bhashaa ke astitv kaa tattvik moolyankan karata he
 His approach is rational
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke nishkarsh kisi vyakti, raashtra yaa kaal ke aadhaar par parivartit nahin hote hai tathaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan kaa mul aadhaar jo bhashaa he vah maanavkrut padaarth nahin he
 Therefore, we cannot count linguistics in the field of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii upyogita isamen he ki vah bhashaa sikhaane kii kala kaa gyaan karaata he
 For this reason, Sweet has called grammar a language as both an art and a science
 bhashaa kaa shuddh uccharan, prabhaavshaalee prayog kala kii koti main rakhe ja sakate hai
 Linguistics cannot be kept within the limits of art, when it is decided that the question arises as to whether linguistics, physics, chemistry etc
 are subjects like science? anek vidwaanon kii dharna main bhashaa-vigyaan vishuddh vigyaan nahin he
 According to his belief, all the experiments of linguistics have not yet been achieved to perfection and hence its conclusions cannot be called final conclusions
 iske saath hi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi nishkarsh vigyaan kii bhanti saarvbhaumik or saarvkalik bhi nahin he
 Just as mathematics has 2 + 2 = 4 everlasting, inferential conclusions that are universally accepted, linguistics does not have an unquestionable conclusion of this kind
 vigyaan main tathyon kaa sankalan or vishleshan hota he or dhwani ke niyam adhikanshtah vikalparahit hi hai, atah kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar bhashaa-vigyaan ko manviki evam vigyaan ke madhya main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 After considering it, we see that in today's fast progress of science, every particular knowledge is becoming old and unscientific in front of its upcoming knowledge
 nity naveen avishkaron ke aaj ke yug main vaigyanik drushti nity sookshm se sookshmatar or naveen se navyatar hoti chali ja rahi he
 In view of today's developed field of knowledge, many scientific beliefs have become outdated and faded
 newton kaa prakaash siddhanth bhi ab sandeh kii drushti se dekha jane laga he
 This proves that in the light of new knowledge, ancient knowledge is also excluded from the field of science
 atah vishuddh gyaan kii drushti se vichaar karne par bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham vigyaan ke hi seemaa-kshetra main pate hai
 Linguistics is definitely a science under which we gain special knowledge of language
 yah sahi he ki abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan kaa vaigyanik str par purnatah vikaas nahin ho paaya he
 This is the reason why Grasmann and Werner had to improve by following the famous Grimm-rule
 ukt sudhaaron se purv grim kaa dhwani niyam nischit niyam hi mana jaataa tha or sudhaaron ke baad bhi vah nischit niyam hi mana jaataa he
 Thus, there is no opposition to science due to the refutation of old principles in the light of new knowledge
 vastav main yahi shuddh vigyaan he
 After 1930, where descriptive linguistics gained importance again, there has been rapid development since then
 jab se dhwani ke kshetra main yantron kii sahaayta se naye-naye pareekshan prarambh hue hai tathaa praapt nishkarsh puri tarah niyamit hone lage hai, tab se hi bhashaa-vigyaan dhire-dhire pragati karata hua vigyaan kii shrenee main mana jane laga he
 a major feature of science is its experimentalism
 america vidvan balum feeld ke baad america bhashaa vigyaniyon ne dhwani-vigyaan evam rup-vigyaan aadi ke saath bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paddati ke rup main praayogic bhashaa-vigyaan kaa badi tivrata ke saath vikaas kiya he
 Under this method, linguistics is becoming the subject of laboratories and many instruments have been invented for it
 yah dekh kar nishchit rup main is vishay ko vigyaan hi kaha jayega, isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he
 Nowadays, where the tradition of using the word science has been in place for the classical subjects like social science, psychology etc
, then linguistics based on pure cause-work tradition cannot be termed as science in any sense
 dow shyamsundar das ne apane granth bhashaa rahasy main likhaa he- In the words of Mangal Dev Shastri dow bholanath tiwari ke ‚Äòbhashaa-vigyaan‚Äô granth main yah paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he- By considering all the definitions given above, it is known that there is no difference between them
 dow shyamsundar das kii paribhaasha main jahaan keval bhashavigyaan par hi drushti kendrit rahi he vahin mangaldev shastri evam bholanath tiwari ne apni paribhaashaon main bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayan ke prakaaron ko bhi samahit kar liya he
 Definitions are good that are concise and clear
 is prakaar ham bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paribhaasha is prakaar de sakate hai- ‚Äújis adhyayan ke dwaara maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaae, use bhashaa-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 " duusare shabdon main bhashaa-vigyaan vah he jisamen maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vyapak vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Except the current form of language, the rest of the study material is available only from literature to linguistics
 yadi aaj hamaare saamne sanskrit, greek or avesta sahitya na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan kabhi yah jaanane main safal na hota ki ye teenon bhashaayen kisi ek mul bhashaa se nikali hai
 Similarly, if Hindi literature from the early to modern period was not in front of us, how could linguistics study the historical development of Hindi language? bhashaa-vigyaan kisi prakaar se bhi bhashaa kaa adhyayan kare use pag-pag par sahitya kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Hearing this from the mouth of the naughty boys of Bundelkhand- vyakaran kahata he ki yah kya bhalaa he, pracheen sahitya kaa adhyayan hi use batalaayegaa ki shakatayan ke pratham sutara ‚Äòuun namah siddham‚Äô kaa hi yah bigadaa hua rup he
 Literature also succeeds in finding solutions to many of its problems with the help of linguistics
 dow vasudev sharan agarwal ne bhashaa-vigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par jysikrut ‚Äòpadmavat‚Äô ke bahut se shabdon ko unke mul roopon se jod kar unke arthon ko spasht kiya he
 It has also taken substantial help in determining the pure text
 atah sahitya or bhashaa-vigyaan donon ek duusare ke sahaayak hai
 Language is a reflection of our thoughts and thoughts, so with the help of language many problems can be solved
 vishesh rup se arthvigyaan to manovigyaan par puri tarah se aadhaarit he
 Psychology also provides adequate help in the study of syntax
 kabhi-kabhi dhwani-parivartan kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye bhi manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Child psychology and psychology of underdeveloped people also helps us in knowing the origin and initial form of language
 manovigyaan ko bhi apni chikitsa-paddati main rogi kii ulajlul baton kaa arth jaanane ke liye bhashaa-vigyaan se sahaayta leni padati he
 Therefore, with the help of linguistics, a psychologist can be successful in detecting the patient's ailments
 bhashaa-vigyaan or manovigyaan ke ghanishtha sambandhon ke kaaran hi aajkal bhashaa manovigyaan yaa psycolinginvasticks naamak ek nayi adhyayan-paddati kaa vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is called the sound emanating from the mouth, so in linguistics, how does the air move from within, what changes do it cause due to larynx, larynx, nasal cavity, crow, palate, teeth, tongue, lip, throat, hoarseness and nose and One has to study how sound is received by the ear
 isamen sharir-vigyaan hi uski sahaayta karata he
 Eclipse of written language is done by eye and study of this process is also done under linguistics
 iske liye bhi use sharir vigyaan kaa rini hona padataa he
 Linguistics and geography also have a deep connection
 kuch logon ke anusaar kisi sthaan kii bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa uski bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the language spoken in a place, there are definitely words for trees, plants, birds, animals and food etc
 But if any of them ends, then its name also gets attached to the language there
 ‚Äòsomalata‚Äô shabd kaa prayog aaj hamaari bhashaa main nahin hota
 The reason for this omission is probably geographical
 kisi sthaan main ek bhashaa kaa dur tak prasar na hona, bhashaa main kam vikaas hona tathaa kisi sthaan main bahut si boliyon kaa hona bhi bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa hi parinaam hota he
 The castes living on inaccessible mountains are unable to spread their dialect due to low mutual contact
 nadiyon ke aar-paar rahane vaale logon kii boli-bhashaa saamaanya bhashaa se hat kar bhinn hoti he
 In doing linguistic studies of the names of countries, cities, rivers and provinces etc
, geography provides great recreational material
 arth-vichaar ke kshetra main bhi bhugol bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta karata he
 Geography also helps in considering the problems of 'camel', how camel came out of buffalo and why 'sandhava' means horse and salt
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek shakha bhashaa-bhugol kii adhyayan-paddati to thik bhugol kii hi bhanti hoti he
 Similarly, linguistics is also helpful in studying the geography of prehistoric times of a place
 itihaas kaa bhi bhashaa-vigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh he
 With regard to three forms of history, political history, religious history, social history - its relation with linguistics is being shown here
 bhashavigyaan ke adhyayan main tarkshastra, bhautikashastra evam maanav-shaastra jaise anya gyaan ke kshetra bhi badi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 Many kinds of superstitions in humans take place which affect their language
 bhartiya saamaj main striyaan apane pati kaa naam ghuma-firaakar leti he, sidhaa-spasht nahin
 At night giant insects are not named
 ve apane ladke kaa naam maange, chhedi, bechu, ghurhu, katvaaru alichaar yaa lenda, aadi rakhte hai
 Apart from superstitions, many other socio-psychology related clauses have to resort to the branches of anthropology
 is prakaar gyaan ke anek kshetra- samskruti-adhyayan, shikshashastra, sankhyikee, paath-vigyaan - aadi bhashaa vigyaan se gaharaa sambandh rakhte hai
 The field of human language is the field of linguistics
 sansarbhar ke sabhy-asabhy manushyon kii bhashaaon or boliyon kaa adhyayan bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In this way, linguistics does not only study civilized-literary languages, but also the study of those languages which are lost in the pride of the past, which are not in vogue, barbaric-unfriendly dialects
 vishay-vibhaajan kii drushti se bhashavigyaan ko bhashaa-sanrachana evam 'arth kaa adhyayan' main baanta jaataa he
 In it, apart from analyzing and describing the language from a scientific point of view, comparative studies between different languages are also done
 bhashavigyaan ke do paksh hai- tattvik or vyavhaarik
 In addition, linguistics has a deep connection with other branches of knowledge science
 isse samajabhashavigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, gananamulak bhashavigyaan, aadi isaki vibhinn shakhaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The following are the minor areas of linguistics: vaakya-vigyaan : bhashaa main sara vichaar-vinimay vaakyon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 The department of linguistics in which it is considered is called syntax or syntax
 iske teen rup hai- Syntax is related to the psychology of the speaking society
 isliye bhashaa-vigyaan kii yah shakha bahut kathin he
 Morphology: The construction of a sentence is based on terms or forms
 atah vaakya ke baad pad yaa rup kaa vichaar mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Under meteorology, all the instruments have to be considered from the metal, prefix, suffix etc
 shabd-vigyaan : rup yaa pad kaa aadhaar shabd he
 The words composition or history can be considered from these two points of view
 kisi vyakti yaa bhashaa kaa vichaar bhi iske antargat kiya jaataa he
 Thesaurus and etymology come under the limits of the field of word science itself
 bhashaa ke shabd samooh ke aadhaar par bolne vaale kaa saanskrithik itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 Phonology: The basis of the word is sound
 dhwani-vigyaan ke antargat dhvaniyon kaa anek prakaar se adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Under it, phonology is a separate subdivision in which the sound-producing organs ‚Äî buccal-vocal, nasal-vocal, vocal apparatus, sound-instrument, as well as the process of hearing are also studied
 is adhyayan ke do rup hai-aitihaasik or doosraa tulanaatmak
 The Grimm rule is related to this
 arth-vigyaan : vaakya kaa bahari ang dhwani par samaapt ho jaataa he yah bhashaa kaa bahari kalevar he iske aage uski aatma kaa kshetra prarambh hota he jise ham arth kehete hai
 a word without meaning is meaningless like a selfless body
 atah arth bhashaa kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he
 In semantics, the development of the meanings of words and its reasons are considered
 kisi bhi adhyayan ko ham vaigyanik tab kehete hai jab usamen ek nishchit prakriya ko apana kar chalate hai
 Linguistics is also tied to certain processes for the purposeful rational analysis of a language
 inhen prakriyaaon ke aadhaar par abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan ke paanch prakaar ke adhyayan hamen praapt hote hai- Language is usually studied with the following terms: varnatmak paddati dwaara ek hi kaal kii kisi ek bhashaa ke swaroop kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 For this, the principles highlighted in it, on the basis of which the creative features of language-specific can be explained
 dhyatavya he ki is paddati main ek saath vibhinn kaalon ko bhashaa kaa samavesh nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki har kaal kii bhashaa ke vishleshan ke liye pruthak-pruthak siddhanton kaa prayojan padegaa
 Panini is the largest linguist not only in India, but also in the world, who has done a detailed and comprehensive study of the language in descriptive form
 katyayan evam patanjali bhi isi koti main aate hai
 Among Greek scholars, Thrax, Discolus and Erodean also did notable work in this area
 panini se purna prabhavit hokar bluemfield ne san 1932 i
 main 'language' naamak apana granth prakashit karwaakar varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Descriptive linguistics has developed here in Western countries, especially in the United States
 kisi bhashaa me vibhinn kaalon main parivartanon par vichaar karnaa evam un parivartanon ke sambandh main siddhanto kaa nirmaan hi aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kaa uddeshy hota he
 The basic difference of the descriptive method is that the descriptive method is unicameral, where the historical method is bicameral
 sankrut bhashaa kii pracheenta ne aitihaasik paddati kii ore bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 The main formulation of 'philology' was the comparative study of the languages of ancient texts
 mukhyatah sanskrit, german, greek, lotin jaisi bhashaaon par hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan kendrit rahaa
 Frederick Auguste Wolf drew the attention of scholars to the historical method in the year 1777 itself
 vastutah, kisi bhi bhashaa ke vikasaatmak rup ko samajhane ke liye aitihaasik paddati kaa sahaara lenna hi padegaa
 What has changed in Old Hindi or Medieval Hindi and Modern Hindi can be explained only by historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati dwaara do yaa do se adhik bhashaaon kii tulana kii jaati he
 It can also be called a mixed method, because the basis of both the descriptive method and the historical method is taken
 vivaran ke liye kisi ek kaal ko nishchit karnaa hota he or tulana ke liye kam-se-kam do bhashaaon kii apeksha hoti he
 Thus, comparative method can be called the sum of descriptive method and historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati kinhin do bhashaaon par lagu ho sakati he
 For example, comparison is also done in Indian languages - Bhojpuri etc
 Or comparative study of hindi-english, hindi-russian, hindi-persian is also done
 arthath isamen kshetragat seemaa nahin he
 Scholars like William Jones, France Bopp, Maxm√ºller, Curtius, August Schlikher, have made significant contributions to the development of comparative linguistics
 par, abtak tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan main un siddhanton kii badi kami he, jinke aadhaar par do bhinn bhashaaon kaa vargeekaran vaigyanik nahin ban sakaa
 The structural method is the sequel to the descriptive method
 america main is paddati kaa vishesh prachaar ho rahaa he
 In this, mechanical devices are being given more importance, which will facilitate special translation
 jalig haris ne 'methaids in strectural lingusticks ' naamak pustak likhakar is paddati ko viksit kiya
 Linguistics, like other branches of science, has experimental aspects, which require systems of experimentation and laboratory
 bhinn-bhinn yantric prayogon ke dwaara uccharnatmak swanvigyaan, bhautik swanvigyaan or shravnatmak swanvigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It is also called experimental phonology, mechanical phonology or laboratory phonology
 isamen darpan jaise saamaanya upkaran se lekar jatiltam vaidyut upkarnon kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 As a result, full cooperation of mathematicians, physicists and engineers in the field of linguistics is expected

 The endoscope is an improved form of laryngoscope
 osilograph kii tarangen swanon ke bhautik swaroop ko parde par yaa film par atyant spashtataa se ankit kar detii he
 The same work is done more successfully by spectographs or sonographs
 spectograph jo chitra prastut karata he unhen pattern plabac dwaara phir se suna ja saktaa he
 Recorded material can be heard at a slow speed with the help of speechstretcher
 inke atirikt or bhi chote bade yantra hai, jinase bhashavaigyanik adhyayan main paryaapt sahaayta lee ja rahi he
 Among French linguists, Ruio wrote a treatise about the use of phonology
 landan main pro farth ne vishesh taluyantr kaa vikaas kiya
 For the measurement of vowels, as the lines of the vowel point or the quadrilateral are set, they form the basis lines for the measurement of consonants, by which the utterances can be described exactly
 danniel jans or ida ward ne bhi angreji swanvigyaan par mahatvapurn kaary kiya he
 Armstrong, Bethel and Boyanus are the main speakers of French, German and Russian languages
