 bhartiya darshan main parmaanu kaa ullekh paashchaatya vigyaan se kai sadi pehle hi ho gaya tha
 Atoms and molecules are, by many opinions, two names from the same element
 bhinn bhinn darshan ke anusaar parmaanuon kaa apane tareeke se varnan kiya gaya hai
 But the summary of this is that atoms are the most subtle part of matter, which does not have much division
 parmaanu sanskrit bhashaa ke do shabdon kaa mail hai - param + anu
 The ultimate means the best and the molecule means the smallest part
 tatah, parmaanu or anu kaa sthool rup se arth ek hi hai
 But since science has addressed smaller parts of molecules than molecules, it is not wrong to consider an indivisible atom as different from a molecule
 vaisheshik main chaar bhuton ke chaar tarah ke parmaanu maane hai — prithvi parmaanu, jal parmaanu, tej parmaanu or vaayu-parmaanu
 The fifth ghost is the sky
 isse uske tukade nahin ho sakate
 Atoms have to be accepted because all the substances which are seen are made of small pieces
 in tukdon main se kisi ek ko lekar baraabar tukade karte gaye to ant main aise tukade honge jo dikhaai na padenge
 The theory of Vaiseshiks is that the causes are the properties of the work itself, so as the properties are in the atom, the properties will be in the objects made from them
 jaise, gandh, gurutv aadi jis prakaar prithvi parmaanu main rahete hai usee prakaar sab parthiv vastuon main hote hai
 Due to the combination of justice and Vaiseshika, the origin of earth and other substances has been created by the combination of these atoms, whose sequence is written in this way in the Prastapada Bhashya - jab jeevon ke karmakal ke bhoga kaa samay aata he tab maheshwar kii us bhoga ke anukool sristi karne kii ichha hoti he
 According to this desire, the movement of air atoms is generated by the force of the invisible animal

 Basic education is very important and valuable in the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi to India
 ise wardha yojana, nayi talim, 'buniyadi talim' tathaa 'basic shiksha' ke naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Gandhiji planned a 'new training' on 23 October 1937, which was to be given a nationwide practical form
 unke shaikshik vichaar shikshashastriyon ke tatkaaleen vichaaron se mail nahin khate, isaliye prarambh main unke vichaaron kaa virodh hua
 Gandhiji said that the idea of the new training is his last and best contribution to India
 gandhiji ke jinav-paryant chale satya ke anveshan evam raashtra ke nirmaan hetu sakriy prayogon ke madhyam se lambe samay tak vichaaron ke gahan manthan ke parinamswaroop nayi talim kaa darshan evam prakriya kaa pradurbhaav hua jo keval bharatvarsh hi nahin, apitu sampoorn maanav samaaj ko ek nayi disha dene main sakasham tha
 But unfortunately this best welfare education system could not be used properly even at the national level, due to which till today this country was unable to achieve meaningful and right swaraj as per Gandhiji's dream
 balki iske vipareet aaj to alam yah he ki shaikshanik, saamaajik evam aarthik drushti se bharat punah paashchaatya samrajyavad ke adheen nirantar sarakta chalaa ja rahaa he

 parantu isliye ki sabhi abhibhavakon main yah ichhashakti evam saahas nahin he ki apane bacchon ko sarkaron athwa puunjipatiyon dwaara nirdhaarit angreji shiksha ko tyagkar bhartiya shiksha dilaawein
 Till this cowardly mentality of the general public will not be changed, no Indian educational system including new training can flourish in this country
 22–23 oktober, 1937 ko wardha main jo 'akhil bhartiya shaikshik sammelan' yojit hua, uski adhyakshata gandhiji ne kii

 in prastaavon ke aadhaar par ek rashtriya shaikshik yojana taiyaar kii gayi jo desh bhar main 'nai talim', 'buniyadi shiksha' yaa 'wardha yojana' ke naam se prasiddh hui
 As a result of the declaration of the Government of India Act of 1935, when the Congress governments in seven provinces of British India formulated a program for national reconstruction, basic education was also a cornerstone in its fourteen pillars
 gandhi ji buniyadi shiksha ko saamaajik parivartan kaa ek saadhan samajhate the
 They considered it to be a major basis of a quiet social revolution
 ve vyakti ke shaareerik, maansik tathaa aadhyatmik pakshon ke punarnirmaan dwaara saamaajik kranti kaa ek pramukh aadhaar maanate the
 They wanted to bring about a social revolution by rebuilding the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the person
 aatmavishvaas evam aatmanirbharta ko hi unhone manushya ke purna vikaas kaa aadhaar mana
 He considered education as the birthright of every person
 isiliye unhone saat se chaudaa varshavaale varg ke sabhi baalkon evam balikaon ko ni:shulk evam anivaary shiksha dena aavashyak samajha
 After the acceptance of the Basic National Education Scheme at the Haripur session of the Indian National Congress, since 1938, many experiments in basic education started but they were done at different and limited levels
 san 1939 i
 main dwitiya mahayuddh ke chhid jane se ek or kathinaayee upasthit ho gai
 The Congress cabinet had to resign due to political reasons
 unase yah aashaa kii jaati thi ki ve buniyadi shiksha ke vikaas main sahaayak honge
 But as a result of his resignation, experiments were stopped altogether in some provinces and indifference to experimentation began to appear in other provinces
 swatantraprapti ke baad hi buniyadi shiksha ko shiksha kii rashtriya paddati ke rup main gambhirthapurvak sweekaar kiya gaya
 Basic education continued to progress as the number of basic schools continued to grow
 kintu saadhaaran praarambhik or middle skulon kii apeksha basic skulon kii sankhya kii vruddhi kii gati main kami rahi he
 The status of admission to basic schools has not been satisfactory
 lakshya to yah tha ki basic shiksha main 6 se 14 varsh ke vargvaale sabhi ladakon evam ladakiyon ke liye buniyadi shiksha kaa prabandh kiya jaae
 But no significant progress was made in the first two schemes in this education
 is kaal main buniyadi shiksha ke prasar kii pragati utani bhi nahin hui jitani saadhaaran praarambhik shiksha ke prasar kii, yadhyapi saadhaaran praarambhik shiksha kii pragati bhi santoshjanak nahin he
 The condition of teacher teaching is also not satisfactory at all
 bharat main praarambhik shikshakon kii shiksha ke bare main pratham rashtriya vichaargoshtee kii 1960 i
 kii report or haal main adhyaaapak prashikshan ke sambandh main plan projects kii samiti kii 1963 i
 kii report se siddh hota he ki adhyaaapak prashikshan kaarykram main anek trutiyaan hai
 It has not only lacked proper and qualified staff, buildings, equipment and other macro resources but has also been blamed for inadequate curriculum and ineffective method and style of teaching
 buniyadi shiksha kii koi spasht paribhaasha nahin he jisase log saadharantaya sahamat hon
 There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the basic fundamentals and definite goals of basic education
 gandhi ji ne buniyadi shiksha ke siddhanton ko pratipaadit karte samay ek nishchit saamaajik vyavastha kii kalpana kii thi
 He considered productive work as the center of education, but in actual use, the principle of education by productive work has different meanings
 kuch shikshavid, jo gandhi ji ke anuyaayi hone kaa daawa karte hai, vidyalayon main prayog yogya vastuon ke vaastavik utpaadan par jor dete hai
 Some people believe that this means nothing but education through sports law
 buniyadi shiksha main aatmanirbharta kaa prashn or bhi vivadpurn he
 Gandhiji considered self-reliance as the real criteria of education
 aatmanirbharta se unka taatpary yah tha ki basic skool is seemaa tak swaavlambee ho jaaen ki adhyapakon kaa vetan vidyalayon main bacchon dwaara utpaadit vastuon ko bechakar diya ja sake
 Therefore, initially a very large section of the supporters of basic education started to hope that if a proper environment is created for basic education, then the expenditure on it will be expended and the government will pay the remaining expenses so that basic schools can run efficiently
 kintu anubhav se yah anumaan galat siddh hua
 The pires-lakhani Committee appointed by the Ministry of Education, Government of India, studied this problem and stated that no school was more than 41
09 percent self-supporting in 1950–1951 in Bihar, which was considered to be the primary state of basic education
 sewagram kaa basic skool, jo hindustani talimi sangh ke pathpradarshan evam nirikshan main chal rahaa tha, 63 pratishat tak swaavlambee tha
 Isanan had the distinction of getting first place in the list of basic schools in this direction
 san 1949-1950 main bihar pradesh ke 100 basic skool, jinamein 18 senior basic skool bhi the, keval 15 pratishat hi swaavlambee ho sake
 Since then, in general, there is no change in the situation towards goodness
 bharat sarkaar dwaara buniyadi shiksha ke liye pratham panchavarshiya yojana ke ant main jo moolyankan samiti niyukt hui thi vah bhi isi nishkarshan par pahaunchi
 The Government of India did not even mention self-reliance in the booklet titled 'concept of Basic Education'
 yahan tak ki gandhivaad ke aadarshon ke mahan poshak vinoba bhaave kaa bhi ab yah vichaar ho gaya he ki bacchon dwaara utpaadit vastuon ke vikray kaa laabh shiksha par honevaale uchit kharch ke kam karne par prayog na kiya jaae balki vah abhibhavakon ko milanaa chahie jisase ve apane kaam main apane bacchon kii sahaayta se laabh na uthaa sakane ke kaaran hui kshati ko puraa kar saken
 It seems that the government, in principle, accepts that the profits derived from the productive work of children should be spent in their own interest, such as managing school clothes or mid-day meals
 isliye yah nishkarsh to nikaala hi ja saktaa he ki gandhi ji kii kalpana ke anusaar basic skulon main utpaadak vyavsaayon ko aarambh kar dene se buniyadi shiksha kaa kharch badi maatra main kam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore, if basic education is to be made a universal method of elementary education across the country, then for this, an economically abundant economy is necessary
 buniyadi shiksha ko saarvbhaum banane ke prashn ko yatharth ke str par sochna chahie
 India has pledged to establish a society with socialist ideals
 aise samaaz kii anivaary baton main se ek yah he ki iske sabhi sadsy sushikshit hon taaki ve saamaanya hit ke liye adhik se adhik yogadan kar saken or apane sammilit praytn kaa jo fal ho usase uchit rup se laabh uthaa saken
 Therefore, universal, free and compulsory education should be the first to be managed within the shortest possible time
 samvidhan kii 45 veen dhara ke anusaar 1960 i
 tak 14 varsh kii avasthaavale sabhi bacchon kii ni:shulk evam anivaary shiksha kaa rajya kii ore se prabandh ho janaa chahie tha
 This is a huge problem and great solutions, both human and physical, are needed to solve it
 yah anumaan he ki yadi desh apni rashtriya aay kaa do pratishat keval praarambhik shiksha par kharch kare to aavashyak saadhan itani maatra main praapt kiye ja sakate he ki chad se 14 varshavaale varg ke sabhi bacchon ko shiksha kii suvidhaayen 1980-1981 tak praapt ho jaaen
 Now, if basic education is given to all children, it will take much longer to reach the level of universal education
 buniyadi shiksha ucch koti kii hone ke kaaran adhik mahangi he
 It is clear from the recommendations of the Auxiliary Committee appointed by the National Committee on Basic Education that the development of elementary education as well as basic education, keeping in view the minimum means required to convert an ordinary elementary school into a basic school Seems necessary
 aavashyaktaa is baat kii he ki ek doordarshee yojana banaai jaae jiske anusaar buniyadi shiksha kaa vistaar baraabar hota rahe taaki ant main yah rashtriya str par praarambhik shiksha kii sudhari hui paddati ke rup main viksit ho jaae
 Some things that need to be done are proposed below: paramparaagat siddhanton par hi kaam kar rahe basic skulon ko kam se kam anivaary sharton kii purti karte hue sachche basic skool bananaa chahie
 The schools which have not been fully developed should be given maximum help so that they become ideal basic schools and others should follow them
 buniyadi shiksha ke vistaar ko lagaataar badhaate rahen
 Convert ordinary schools to basic schools and open new basic schools
 adhikansh pradesh basic skulon kii sankhya ko prativarsh kam se kam 5 pratishat to badha ho sakate hai
 While choosing industries for basic schools, it should be kept in mind that the industries should be prosperous in terms of education and adapt to the social environment and condition of children
 kachche maal kii barabaadi ko rokane ke liye basic skulon kii nimna shreniyon main udyog sambandhi kaary us samay tak na karaayaa jaae jab tak bachche itane paripakv na ho jaaen ki ve iskaa prayog laabhpurvak kar saken
 Soil work, elementary gardening or some low-cost hand work can be done in the lower classes
 buniyadi shiksha ke paathyakram main is aadhaar par parivartan karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Some elements of basic education can be easily adopted in all elementary schools, such as health-related activities, social service programs, cultural activities, etc
 aisa vidhyalay, jiske paas paryaapt maatra main bhoomi ho or sinchai kii suvidhaayen paryaapt hon, fal or tarkariyon ke utpaadan kaa kaary kar saktaa he
 It is necessary that the schools in which these activities are started should be properly planned and at the same time, full educational benefit should be taken from them
 uttar buniyadi vidhyalay ko bahuddeshiy ucchtar madhyamik vidhyalay kii ek shakha samajhnaa chahie jahaan us udyog main yogyata praapt karne par bal diya jaae jise ek chaatr basic skool se karata chalaa aayaa he
 In 1957, the Central Advisory Board of Education, on the opinion of the committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Education for detailed study in this matter, insisted that basic basic education should remain a part of the prevailing secondary education system of the country
 basic skool kii shaikshik yojana ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki adhyapakon kii shaikshik prishthbhumi ucch koti kii ho or ve apane kaary main praveen hon
 All the training institutions that prepare teachers for elementary schools should be of basic style
 prayek pradesh ke prayek jile main ek adarsh prashikshan vidhyalay sthapit kiya jaae
 Four to five basic schools should be attached to this training school
 is centre main paryaapt rup se adhyaaapak evam upkaran hon or buniyadi shiksha kaa sampurna kaarykram isi ke dwaara puraa kiya jaae
 It should be an integral part of a multi-disciplinary college of training which has many training institutes to prepare teachers for all levels of education and different branches of the school program
 1938 main buniyadi shiksha kii moulik yojana jakir hossain samiti ne taiyaar kii thi
 In it, it was recommended that a committee of education should be set up in every province whose functions should also include the work of search and organization in basic education
 prayek pradesh main sthapit shiksha kii pradeshy sanstha buniyadi shiksha kii vividh samasyaon kaa adhyayan tathaa anusandhan kaary kare
 The National Council of Educational Research and Training should research problems of national importance
 anusandhan dwaara samavaay paddati ko adhyaaapak ke liye subodh tathaa sugam bana diya jaae
 There are some main problems related to basic education that need immediate attention to solve, such as the problem of teaching multiple classes by the same teacher, the problem of teaching classes in which the number of children is very large, of different industries
 To explore the educational possibilities and develop their method and production capacity by which to check how far weaving The progress of Hindi education is being made according to its objectives so that the teachers and administrators of basic education can benefit from these methods and tools as needed, to pay attention to the problems of the training institutions preparing teachers for basic schools so that the training program is made effective
 And to pay attention to the preparation of appropriate literature for the students

 eid-ul-juha is a major festival of people who believe in the religion of Islam
 ramajaan ke pavitra maheene kii samaapti ke lagbhag 70 dinon baad ise manaaya jaataa he
 According to Islamic belief, Hazrat Ibrahim inscribed his son Hazrat Ismail on the same day, on the order of God that he was going to sacrifice in the way, then Allah gave life to his son, in whose memory this festival is celebrated

 haj or uske saath judi hui paddati hazrat ibrahim or unke parivaar dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ko pratikatmak taur par dohraane kaa naam he
 Hazrat was survived by his wife Hajra and son Ismail
 manyata he ki hazrat ibrahim ne ek swapn dekha tha jisamen vah apane putr ismail kii qurbaani de rahe the hazrat ibrahim apane das varshiya putr ismail ko ishwar kii raah par qurbaan karne nikal pade
 It comes in the books that God sent his angels to sacrifice an animal in place of Ismail
 darasal ibrahim se jo asal qurbaani maangi gai thi vah thi unki khud kii thi arthath ye ki khud ko bhul jaao, matlab apane sukh-aaraam ko bhuulakar khud ko maanavtaa / insaaniyat kii seva main puri tarah se laga do

 These states had particularly vague views on Macedonia
 isliye is samjhaute main yah bhi spasht kar liya gaya tha ki turki kii paraajay ke pashchaat mysidonia ke pradeshon ko kis prakaar vibhakt kiya jayega
 It was certain that the major part of Macedonia would be given to Balgeria and Albania would be given to Servia

 According to the agreement reached before the Balkan Wars, Serbia should have found Albania
 par austria kisi mulya par srbija ke adheen albania nahin hone dena chahta tha
 The reason for this was that the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina was mainly Yugoslav and Serbs
 srbija ke saath milakar ye pradesh ek shaktishaalee yugoslav rajya kaa nirmaan karnaa chaah rahe the
 If this had happened, the power of Serbia would have increased which was detrimental to Austria

 sadanira nadi ko agni sukha nahin sake or videgh maathav dwaara yah puche jane par ki ab meraa nivas kahan ho, agni ne uttar diya ki is nadi ke purv kii ore tumhaara nivas ho
 It is clearly mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmin that earlier Brahmins did not cross this river and the land here was not fertile
 usamen daldal bahut tha kyonki agni vaishwanar ne uskaa aswadan nahin kiya tha
 But now it is very fertile because the Brahmins have sacrificed it and offered it to the fire

 aise bhojan ve log kiya karte hai jo shaakaahaari aahaar main sankraman ke daur main yaa swasthya, paryaavaran yaa anya kaarnon se pashu maance kaa upbhog ghataate ja rahe hai

 While dairy products and eggs provide a complete source for lacto-ovo vegetarians; These are the only botanical sources that contain significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids
 ye hai lupin, soy, hempsid, chia seed, amaranth, bak wheat or quinoa
 Although essential amino acids can be obtained by eating a wide variety of complementary vegetable sources, this may be caused by a combination of all eight essential amino acids providing flora; Iron deficiency anemia appears to have no relation to diet
 paudhe aam taur par vitamin bi12 ke mahatvapurn strot nahin hote hai
 However, lacto-ovo can obtain B12 from vegetarian dairy products and eggs, and vegans can be obtained from fortified food and supplements
 chunki maanav sharir bi12 ko surakshit rakhata he or iske saar ko nasht kiye bina iskaa phir se upyog karata he, isiilie bi12 kami ke udhaaharan asaamaanya hai

 However, it is not found in lacto-ovo vegetarians
 calcium ke kuch sroton main kollard saag, bok choy, kaale, shalgam ke saag shaamil hai
 Spinach Raspalak and Beet Greens are rich in calcium, but calcium is bound to be oxalate and therefore not absorbed well

 " "mortelity in british vegitarians" main, ek samaan nishkarsh nikaala gaya he: "british shaakaahaariyon main aam aabaadi kii tulana main mrityu dar kam he
 Their mortality rates are similar to those comparable with carnivores, with said smoking prevalence and generally high socioeconomic status such as non-dietary lifestyle factors or other aspects of diets other than meat and fish diet
 Due to this, you can get this benefit

 Adventist health studies are again included in a meta study entitled "does low meat consumption make longevity of human life?" It was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, which concluded that fewer meat eaters and other lifestyle choices led to a significant increase in age compared to the meat-eating group
 adhyayan ne nishkarsh nikaala ki "swasth vayaskon ke ek aabaadi varg main paae gayi nishkarshon ne yah sambhaavna badha di ki ek lambii avadhi tak shaakaahaari bhojan ke avlamban se aayu main ek ullekhneey 3

 "however, the study also concluded that" marked differences in composition between confounders' studies, definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, healthy volunteering effect, and vegetarians due to vegetarians consuming certain types of vegetable food There may be some variation in survival benefits

 In a recent study of low-meat diets for all-cause mortality, Singh found that "only 5 out of 5 studies show that adults who followed a pattern of less meat and more vegetarian diets , They perceived a reduction in risk of death significantly or slightly less than other patterns of intake
 " Statistics studies such as comparing longevity with regional and local diets in Europe also found that people are much older in southern France than in more carnivorous northern France, where less meat and more vegetarian Mediterranean food is common
