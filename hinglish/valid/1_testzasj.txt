 At the time, British traders still operated on the wave of local rulers, and so did the unstable political upheaval by Hastings and his allies in Bengal, where the elderly middle Nawab Alivardi Khan was likely to be succeeded by his grandson Siraj
 ud-daula, though many other rival contenders were eyeing the throne
 This was increasingly unsafe in Bengal during the British Trade Post, as Siraj ud-daula was known for harboring anti-european views and likely to launch an attack once he took power
 When Alivardi Khan died in April 1756, British merchants and small outposts at Kasimbazar were abandoned, weakened
 par 3 Since June, being surrounded by a huge force, the British were persuaded a massacre is taking place to prevent the surrender

 Clive was impressed with Hastings when he met him, and arranged for his return to Kasimbazar to resume his pre-war activities
 Later in 1757 the battle resumed, leading to the Battle of Plassey, where Clive would be a decisive victory over the Nawab

 In 1758, Hastings became a British resident in Murshidabad, the capital of Bengali - Clive on the cusp of his career a great step forward
 His role was in the city, apparently as an ambassador but came to Bengal, under the fast dominance of the East India Company he was often given by the new Nawab to issue work orders from Clive and Calcutta

 Hastings personally sympathized with Mir Zafar and considered many of the demands placed on him as a company

 During the reign of Mir Zafar, the East India Company was moving into an increasingly larger role, and effectively took over the defense of Bengal against external invaders when the Bengal soldiers proved to be inadequate
 As she grew older, Mir Zafar became gradually less effective in the ruling state, and overthrowed British troops in 1760, with her power and place to replace her with Mir qasim
reference error: The opening tag is bad or her Name is bad
 Transferred from Calcutta to Hastings expressing his suspicions, they were obliged to respect the honor Mir Zafar, but his opinions were dismissed
 The new Nawab established good relations with Hastings and again had misgivings about the demands he relayed to his superiors
 unhone 1761 main waapas bulaayaa gaya tha or niyukt karne ke liye kalakatta parishad
 Hastings was personally offended when he conducted an investigation into abuses in the trade in Bengal
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kuch europea or british-sambhddha bhartiya vyapaariyon the is sthiti kaa laabh lene ke liye khud ko samrudh vyaktigat rup se

 Hastings felt it was a shame to bring Britain's reputation, and he urged the ruling authorities to put an end to Calcutta

 Finally, little was done to stem the abuses, and Hastings began to consider leaving and then returning to Britain
 His resignation was the only delayed outbreak of lucrative fighting in Bengal
 Once on the throne, Qasim proved increasingly independent in his actions, and he again rebuilt the Bengal army by hiring European instructors and mercenaries who greatly improved the standard's forces

 He gradually felt more confident and at the disposal of a dispute broke out in Patna in 1764 when he captured his British garrison and threatened to execute him if the East India Company responded to the military
 When the soldiers sent to Calcutta anyway, Mir Kasim killed the hostages
 If the British forces went on there would be a series of battles and a decisive battle at the conclusion of the battle in Buxar in October 1764
 After this Mir Qasim was in exile in Delhi, where he later died

 Hastings' first wife, Mary, had died in 1759, and she planned to marry the model once she had obtained a divorce from her husband
 This process took a long time and it was not until 1777 when the news of the divorce came from Germany that Hastings was finally able to marry him

 During his time in Madras Hastings initiated reforms of trade practices which cut out the use of middlemen and profit both company and Indian laborers, but was otherwise relatively uneventful for the period

 Barelvi Muheem is a sub-movement under the Sufi movement in South Asia called It is a campaign originated from the Ahle Sunnah Vall Jamaat which was started by Sunni scholar Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri from Bareilly in Rohelkhand in nineteenth and twentieth century India, 
 barelvi sunni hanfi barelvi musalamaanon kaa ek bada hissaa he jo ab bady sankhya main bharat, bangladesh, pakistan dakshin africa evam britain main sanghanit hai
 Ala Hazrat Imam Ahmed Raza Qadri, through his famous fatwa Razvia, made his significant contribution to defending traditional and orthodox Islam in India

 Most Sunnis of South Asia are Barelvi
 deobandi sunni bhi khaasi taadaad main he
 Ahle Hadiths are Sunnis who do not believe in Sufism
 They are also called Salafi because they claim to understand and believe Islam in the same way that Salaf understood the Quran and Sunnah, Salafi Sunni alias Ahle Hadith is mostly in Saudi Arabia
 And are in Qatar
 ye kisi imam kii taqalid nahin karte
 It is said that Deobandi and Wahhabi ideology has done the work of spreading fundamentalism among Muslims all over the world, although the beginning of militancy in Kashmir and Chechnya was done by the followers of Sufi cult

 Sufis played an important role in the propagation and spread of Islam in India
 He gained considerable success in the spread of Islam, because in many respects the belief systems and practice of Sufis were similar with Indian philosophical literature, especially non-violence and monotheism
 Sufi orthodox attitudes towards Islam have made it easier for Hindus to practice it
 hazrat khwaja muin-ud-ddeen chishti, kutbuddin bakhtiyaar khurma, nizaam-ud-ddeen auliya, shah jalaal-ud-deen siyuti, aamir khusro, sarkaar sabir paak, shaikh abd-ul-haq dahelvi, ashraf jahangir semnani, sarkaar vaaris paak, ata hossain phani chishti ne bharat ke vibhinn bhaagon main islam ke prasar ke liye sufiyon ko prashikshit kiya
 After the Islamic Empire was established in India, the Sufis clearly provided a touch of love and beauty, saving it from being indifferent and harsh
 The Sufi movement also attracted followers from artisan and untouchable communities; He also played an important role in bridging the gap between Islam and indigenous traditions
 Ahmed Sirhindi, a prominent member of the Naqshbandi Sufi, advocated the peaceful conversion of Hindus to Islam

 The Duke of Buckingham, who initiated the purchase, took over both Norwood and Garden Cottage
 ek baar ke nivas ke pashchaat, governor is baat ko lekar aashwast tha kii upree norwood governor ke rahane ke liye upyukt sthaan nahin he
 Soon after his return to Madras, the Duke proposed a two-tier building which could afford the entire residence and public reception rooms for the Governor's family
 1878 or 1881 ke madhya sarkari nivas ke nirmaan ke liye vibhinn moolyanumaan taiyaar kiye gaye or 4,02,914 rupye ke antim moolyanumaan ko sweekrut kiya gaya
 But this price did not include the cost of furnishing the building and hence in July 1888 a detailed estimate was prepared which was Rs 7,79,150
 aakhirkaar sarkari nivas 7,82,633 rupye kii laagat ke saath taiyaar hua
 In 1899 a ball room with rooms was added to this building and in 1904, electrical installations for the entire complex were approved and installed

 Biogas is mostly preferred over fossil fuels
 kam maatra main carbon vaataavaran ke liye swasth hota he, lekin adhik hone par yah takalifdeh ban jaataa he
 Carbon has been present in fossil fuels for so long that it is no longer part of the carbon cycle
 jeevashm eendhan ke jalane par carbon kaa str badhata he
 Biogas is made from recent dead organisms, so it does not disturb the carbon level in the atmosphere
 byogas jeevashm eendhan ke bajaay isliye bhi behatar he kyonki yah sasta or naveekrut urja he
 It is beneficial for developing countries because it can be made in small plants, but some say that the fuel derived from crops will cause food shortages and will lead to forest erosion, water and soil pollution, or oil
 Producing countries will be negatively affected
 byogas plant main pashuon ke vyarth padaarth yaa energy crops ke upyog se byogas banaai jaati he
 Energy crops are grown for biofuels rather than food
 biophul biomas kahe jane vaale mrit organic tatwon se banaaya jaataa he or yah taral, gasiy yaa thos rup main ho saktaa he
 a biogas plant has a digester and a gas holder to manufacture fuel
 plant kaa digester airtite hota he jisamen vyarth padaarth daalaa jaataa he or gas holder main gas kaa sangrahan hota he
 The construction of a biogas plant depends on the gas requirement and the availability of waste material
 saath hi digester ke batch feeding yaa lagaataar feeding par bhi
 The biogas plant is built on or below the ground surface and both models have their advantages and disadvantages
 sataha par bana plant rakh-rakhaav main aasaan hota he or use suraj kii garmi se bhi laabh hota he, lekin iske nirmaan main adhik dhyaan dena hota he kyonki vahaan digester ke andruni dabaav par dhyaan dena hota he
 In contrast, plants below the surface are easy to construct but difficult to maintain

 Caution should only be taken that there is no drinking water source within a 15 meter radius of the biogas plant
 bharat ke tarai evam maidani kshetron main gobar ko upalon ke rup main sukha kar eendhan ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 This kills most of the nutritional elements present in dung
 upala banane main pratidin kareeb 1-2 ghante samay bhi lagata he
 Therefore, instead of using cow dung for cooking, making bio gas from cow dung, using bio gas as fuel does not harm the nutrients because all the nutrients available to the plants are available in the bio gas slurry obtained from bio gas
 While living, there is no smoke in cooking, which does not have any adverse effect on the eyes of the housewife
 baio gas slori ko sidhe yaa chaaya main sukhaakar yaa varmi compost banaakar khaad ke rup main kheton main prayog karnaa chahie
 Nowadays diesel pump sets can also be run with bio gas, which saves diesel and other energy
 byogas sanyantr main gobar kii pachan kriya ke baad 25% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar gas ke rup main hota he or 75% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar khaad ke rup main hota he
 In a 2 cubic meter gas plant, in which about 50 kg of cow dung or 18-25 tons of dung is added in a year, about 10 tons of biogas slurry containing 80% moisture is obtained from that cow dung
 yah kheti ke liye ati uttam khaad hota he isamen nitrogen 1
5 se 2% phosphorus 1
0% evam potash 1
0% tak hota he
 When the fertilizer comes out in the form of slurry from the biogas plant, the nitrogen is present in the slurry as much nitrogen is also present in the slurry, but during the digestion in the plant, there is evidence of carbon conversion in the gas due to reduced carbon nitrogen
 The ratio decreases and the evidence of nitrogen appears to be increased
 byogas sanyantra se nikali patali slori main 20% nitrogen amo
 nikal nitrogen ke rup main hota he atah yadi iskaa turant upyog khet main naaliyaan banaakar athwa sinchai ke pani main milakar khet main chhod diya jaae to iskaa laabh rasinic khaad kii tarah se fasal par turant hota he or utpaadan main 10 se 20 In the biogas plant, after digestion of cow dung, 25% solids are converted into gas and 75% solids are converted to manure
 2 ghan meter ke gas sanyantr main jisamen kareeb 50 kilo gobar roj yaa 18-25 ton gobar ek varsh main daalaa jaataa he, us gobar se 80% namiyukt kareeb 10 ton byogas slori kaa khaad praapt hota he
 It is a very good manure for farming, it contains nitrogen 1
5 to 2% phosphorus 1
0% and potash 1
0%
 byogas sanyantra se jab slori ke rup main khaad baahar aata he tab jitna nitrogen gobar main hota he utana hi nitrogen slori main bhi hota he, parantu sanyantra main pachan kriya ke dauraan carbon kaa roopaantar gas main hone se carbon kaa pramaan kam hone se carbon nitrogen anupaat kam ho jaataa he va isse nitrogen kaa pramaan badha hua prathit hota he
 20% nitrogen amo in thin slurry produced from biogas plant
 Nickel is in the form of nitrogen, so if it is used immediately by making drains in the field or mixed with irrigation water and left in the field, then its benefits like chemical fertilizers are immediately on the crop and increase in production by 10 to 20%
 Can
 slori khaad ko sukhaane ke baad usamen nitrogen kaa kuch bhaag hawa main ud jaataa he
 This fertilizer is applied in non-irrigated farming in evidence of about 5 tonnes per hectare and in irrigated farming 10 tonnes per hectare
 byogas slori ke khaad main mukhya tatwon ke atirikt sookshm poshak tatv evam humas bhi hota he jisase mitti kaa pot sudharta he, jaldharan kshamta badhati he or sookshm jeevanu badhate he
 With the use of this manure, like other organic manure, nutrients are gradually available to the crops for 3 years
 yadi gobar gas sanyantr ghar ke paas va khet se dur he tab patali slori ko sangrahan karne ke liye bahut jagah lagati he va patali slori kaa sthaanantaran bhi kathin hota he aisi avasthaa main slori ko sookhaana aavashyak he

 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition

 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks

 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world

 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers

 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots

 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge

 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable

 For example, competition, art, table, publicity, polis, roll, routine, machine, force, and many other words that have either been or are being Englishized; Many are now pronounced under the rules of phonology of English rather than French
 nauveen shatabdi ke aasapaas se angreji ke lekhan ke liye anglo-sexn roons ke sthaan par latin varnmaala kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 The spelling system, or orthography, is multi-layered
 isamen sthaneey jarmenic pranali ke upar french, greek or latin vartanee ke tatv shaamil hai; bhashaa ke dhwani vigyaan se yah kaaphi hat gaya he
 There is often a considerable difference in the pronunciation and spelling of words
 haalaanki akshar or dhwani algaav main mail nahin khate hai, phir bhi shabd sanrachana, dhwani or lahazon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaye gaye vartanee niyam 75% vishwasaneey hai
 Some phonetic spelling advocates claim that English is more than 80% phonetic
 haalaanki anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji main akshar or dhwani ke bich sambandh utana pragadh nahin he; udahaaran, dhwani anukram ough ko saat bhinn prakaaron se uccharit kiya ja saktaa he
 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task
 greek, french or spanish or kai anya bhashaaon kii tulana main, ek chaatr ko angreji pathan kaa paarangat banane main zyada vakt lagata he
 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main 
debor, cafe, resyum, entry, fiansi or nive jaise shabd aksar donon tareekon se likhe jate hai
 The diacritics are often added to the word to denote them of "high order"

 Some English words retain diacritics to distinguish themselves
 udahaaran, animé, exposé, lamé, öre, øre, pâté, piqué, and rosé, haalaanki aksar inako chhod bhi diya jaataa he 
 uccharan ko spasht karne ke liye kuch udhaar shabd dyacritic kaa upyog kar sakate hai, haalaanki mul shabd main yah maujuud nahin tha
 Eg, maté, from Spanish yerba mate) duniya bhar ke shikshit angreji vaktaaon dwaara lagbhag saarvbhaumik rup se sweekrut bhashaa ke ek sanskaran ko aupchaarik likhit angreji kaha jaataa he
 Its written type remains the same almost everywhere, in contrast to which the English language differs according to dialects, accents, types of slang, local and regional expressions
 bhashaa ke aupchaarik likhit sanskaran main sthaneey bhinnataayen kaaphi simit hai
 The scope of this variation is limited to the spelling differences of British and American English
 angreji pathan ko asana karne ke liye iske kuch sarlikrut sanskaran bhi maujuud hai
 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K
 Ogden with limited words and describes it in his book Basic English: a General Introduction with Rules and Grammar
 yah bhashaa angreji ke ek sarlikrut sanskaran par aadhaarit he
 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English
 ogden ne basic english main aisa koi shabd nahin daalaa jise kuch anya shabdon ke saath bolaa ja sake or anya bhashaaon ke vaktaaon ke liye bhi ye shabd kaam karen, is baat kaa bhi usne khyaal rakhaa

 usne na sirf vyakaran ko saral banaaya, varan upyogkartaaon ke liye vyakaran ko saamaanya rakhane kii bhi koshish kii
 Soon after the Second World War, it received a lot of publicity as a tool for world peace
 Although it was not converted into a program, other similar versions were created for various international uses

 sarlikrut angreji main anumodith shabdon kaa ek shabdkosh he or un shabdon ko kuch vishisht myanon main hi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the word close may be used in the phrase "close the door" but "do not go close to the landing gear"
 angrezon ne duniya ke anek deshon ko raajnneetik rup se apana upnivesh banaaya
 Along with this, they also imposed English cleverly on those countries
 isi kaa parinaam he ki aaj britain ke baahar san raa america, austrailia, newjiland, canada, bharat, pakistan, bangladesh, dakshin africa aadi anek deshon main angrezi kaa varchasv he

 british counsil jaisi santhaayen is angrezi ke prasar ke liye tarah-tarah ke dushprachaar evam gupt abhiyaan karti rahati hai
 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Biology is one of the three huge branches of natural science

 In this science we read about the structure, functions, development, origin, identity, distribution and classification of organisms
 aadhunik jeev vigyaan ek bahut vistrut vigyaan he, jisaki kai shakhaayen hai
 The term 'biology' was first used in 1801 AD by scientists named Lamarck and Travirenes

 The first word of the Latin language appeared in 1736 when Swedish scientist Karl Linnaeus used biology in his Bibliotheca Botanica
 It was used again in 1766, whose work Philosophiae Natural Natural Science Physics: Tomas III, Christin Wolff's The disciple Michael Christoph Hanov did the principles of geologist, biologist, phytologist general According to sector

 Due to the combination of visual art and relatively long and complex releases by the tool, the band generally gained prominence as an advanced-style performance and a part of progressive rock and artistic rock
 The relationship between the band and today's music industry is two-way, which periodically comes across as censorship and an urge for privacy by band members

 When Keenan narrated a tape recording of one of his old band projects to Jones; Jones was so impressed with his voice that he eventually asked his friend to form a separate band of his own
 Then they started working together and started searching for a drummer and a boss player

 The band resumed their tour as planned, with the exception of May 1993
 Tool was to perform at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood, but at the last moment it was heard that the owner of the Garden Pavilion, L

 In September 1995, the band began writing and recording their second studio album
 The tool made the only change to its cast at the time, when bassist Damore left the band by mutual agreement to pursue other projects
 Justin Chancellor, a member of fellow Peaches of prior trips, was eventually chosen to replace Damore, in front of other contestants such as Scott Reeder of Cuss, Frank Cavanav of Filter, E

 Webmaster Kabir Akhtar of The Tool Page, the band's semi-formal acclaimed page, wrote after a travel-related bus accident on a highway, "at least three members of the band are in critical condition"
 This rumor caught the attention of innumerable people and was eventually revealed on radio and MTV

 unki saamaanya aawaaj ke bare main varnan karte hue, olmugec unhen "gharshan yukt, jine ke ediction ke baad kaa heavi metal" kahata he, or da neuyork times isamen "lead japelin ke thandhi saans bharte, batering guitar rifs or madhya purvi mods" jaisi samanthaayen dekhtaa he
 His 2001 work Latralus was compared to Pink Floyd's medley by Allmusic, but after thirty years and changes from "the inspiration to infuse every inch of Infinity with hard guitar meats and pure Darid"
 
 tul ke gaanon ke khazaane kaa ek ghatak od time signechars ke upyog par vishwaas karata he
 For example, bassist Justin Chancellor talks about applying Time Signature to Latralus' first single, "sizm", as 6
5 / 8, and later "applying to all kinds of other creations"
 agle udaahranon main elbum kaa sheershak trek, jo layon ke kramik badlaav ko darshata he, isi prakaar 10,000 days kaa "wings for mairi or "10,000 days " shaamil he
 In addition to this aspect of the band's sound, each member of the band uses within the scope of their music
 baas player patrika chancelar kii bos plaing style kaa varnan ek "moti madhyam range kii tone, guitar-style kii takanic or lochadar chanchalta" ke rup main karte hai
 As an example of this, the magazine "mentioned the use of a wow effect" while striking the notes with the left hand and using the boss's tone control to achieve a tone sweep, such as "the Patient "in song

 Maynard James Keenan's ability as a singer has been delicately portrayed by the Seattle post-intelligencer
 2005 main ek elice in chens reunion concert ke dauraan unke pradarshan ke baad, freelancer travis hey ne unhen "len stalli kii jagah ek swaabhaavik sateek vikalp" ke rup main dekha

 According to Guitar Player magazine, Adam Jones does not rely on any particular technique of guitar-playing, instead he combines several techniques at once
 udhaaharan ke liye, olmugec ne likhaa he ki "sobar main" ve "vaikalpik rup se power cords, khurdari aawaaj, ghantiyon kii jhankaar or ek shant nunata kaa upyog karte hai
 "additionally, the band uses different forms of instrumental use, such as a" pipe bomb microphone "and a talk box guitar solo on" Zambi "
 band apane gaanon kii aawaaj par vishesh jor daalata he or kisi bhi elbum ke saath gaanon ke bolon ko relies na kar, gaanon ko samajhane main inke bolon ke prabhaav ko kam karne kii koshish karata he
 Special attention is often given to settling the lyrics, as in "latralus"
 lateralas ke gaanon ke bolon kii prayek pankti main shabdaanshon kii sankhya febonaxi sankhyaon kii vyavastha ke anuroop he or "jambi" gane main ek saamaanya metrical foot yamb kaa upyog he or isi kaa sandarbh detaa he
 The lyrics of the songs of Enema and Latralus focus on philosophy and spirituality — with special themes ranging from systematic religion in "opiate" to gradual development in "forty-six and Two" and its flourishing in Zangian psychology
 10,000 days ke samay, keenan apane se sambandhit adhik vyaktigat muddon ko talashna chaahate the: elbum kaa naam or iskaa sheershak trek unke sattaiswein varsh se sambandhit hai jis dauraan unki maan ko ek prakaar ke sadame kii jatiltaaon ko jhelana padaa laga tha or antat 2003 main unki maut ho gayi thi
 The band has named The Melvins among their inspirations of progress, but its most-publicized influence is by progressive rock pioneer King Crimson
 lambey samay se king crimson ke sadsy robert frip ne tul par unke band kaa kisi bhi prakaar kaa prabhaav hone se inkaar kiya he
 In an interview with Tool, he briefly explained how the two bands are related to each other, saying "are you able to hear an effect? where i feel an impact is just a figure, Only one
 It was a piece we were working on, which we removed
 or yah lagbhag bilkul vahi aankada he: guitar se praapt ek vishesh uccharan ke saath teen note swar jhankaar
 isiliye mujhe nahin lagata ki aapane ise kabhi suna hoga
 yahi ekmaatr cheez he
 "he also clarified," i was once a fan of the tool
 tul ke sadsy itane udaar hai ki unhone kah diya, unpar crimson kaa ek prabhaav he
 Adam Jones asked me if i could find it in my music and i said, i can't
 i can find more influence of the tool in King Crimson, then i can hear King Crimson in the tool
 " iske baad, maaloof or newquists ne apni pustak da new metal masters main tul ke apane adhikaar kshetra main aadhunik metal par iskaa prabhaav hone kaa shrey diya
 da boston finics ke shaun richardsan maujuuda style par tul ke "ucchstareey prabhaav" ke udhaahranswarup system of e don, deftons or corn ko dekhte hai
 Furthermore, the influence of Keenan's distinctive singing style is seen repeatedly on artists such as Shavele's Pete Leifler
 ek band ke rup main tul ke kaam kaa ek hissaa he apane sangeet video, live kaaryakramon or elbum kii packaging main anya kritiyon ke prabhaavon ko shaamil karnaa
 vishesh rup se, adam jones band ke kala nirdeshak or apane sangeet video ke nirdeshak ke rup main dohari bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Another example of this is an official website, "dedicated to the arts and inspirations" on the band
 band ne aath sangeet video relies kiye hai lekin keval pehle do main hi vyaktigat upasthiti he, jiske bare main band kaa kahana he ki aisa logon ko "sangeet sunne kii bajaay isamen shaamil vyaktitvon par dhyaan dene" se rokane ke liye kiya gaya he
 With the exception of "hush" and "vicarious", all of Tool's music videos feature somewhat steady motion animation
 sabhi video mukhya rup se adam jones dwaara, aksar kalakaaron jaise shet zaar, elex grey, or osius labirint ke sahyog se nirmit hai
 The "somber" music video has received particularly high attention
 jones ne bataaya ki isamen koi kathanak shaamil nahin he, lekin yah bhi kaha ki unka iraadaa nijee bhaawanaaon ko apane kaalpanik rup main ubhaarna tha
 Rolling Stone described this fictional depiction as saying, in the video, that "the devilish man is running through pipes in a dark basement scrawling flesh on the wall" and calling it an "extraordinary", "mythical" clip Told
 Billboard voted it "the best video for a new artist"
 vicarius kaa video 18 disambar 2007 ko dividi par relies kiya gaya tha
 This video is also notable as it is the first tool video created entirely through CGI
 guitar world ke april 2009 ke ank main, adam jones ne ullekh kiya ki band apane gane "da pot" ke liye ek video par kaam kar rahaa he, lekin tab se koi bhi apadet nahin kiya gaya he ki ve apni yojanaon ke anusaar kaam kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 Adam Jones is responsible for most of the band's painting concepts
 unki pehali elbum, anderto main band ke sadasyon ke yogadan se taiyaar iske cover or tasveeron par jones dwaara banaayi gayi ek panjaranuma nakkashi dikhaai gayi he
 Subsequent albums include paintings by fellow artists: Anima and Salivale feature Cam de Leon's works; Laterals and 10,000 Days were produced with the help of Alex Gray
 in rilijon kaa sakaaratmak evam mahatvapurn swaagat kiya gaya, jisamen associated press ke ek sangeet patrkaar ne ek abhinav elbum packaging ke liye band ko ek vishesh sammaan diya
 Both Enema and 10,000 Days were nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Recording Package category, but Enema failed to win the award in 1997, while 10,000 Days won it in 2006
 kala nirdeshak ke rup main, adam jones ne 10,000 days ke liye packaging taiyaar kiya, jisamen 3-di chitrakaari or tasveeron ko dekhne ke liye ek jodi sterioscopy lenson ko dikhaaya gaya he
 Jones has been a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography and expressed a desire to give the packaging a unique look and reflect his favorite painting of the '70s
 nabbe ke dashak ke aarambh main apane pehle dauron ke baad, tul ne duniya bhar kii yatraaon or pramukh mahotsavon jaise lolapaluja, kochela, downlod samaaroh, roskilde, big de out, bonaru, ol points west mujeec and arts samaaroh or apicenter main apni kala kaa pradarshan karte hue surkhiyaan batorin

 unhone lead zeppelin, ted nugent, peach, kus or ramoness ke gaanon ko apane pradarshan main shaamil kiya
 Tool's title tour live shows include an unconventional stage installation and video exhibition
 gayak james menard keenan swayan drumer danni kerri ke saath seedhinuma platformon par peeche qatari main rahete the, jabaki guitaravadak adam jones or basist justin chancelar manch ke donon kinaaron par saamne khadey hote hai
 Keenan, despite being a singer, lives in front of an audience, often towards the background or on the edges of the stage
 koi bhi follospot yaa live camaron kaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa he; isaki bajaay, band ke focus ko band ke sadasyon se alag karne ke liye or peeche bade paradon or bheed kii ore vyapak baikaliting kaa upyog karata he
 The band's live video director, Breckinridge Haggerty, says the dark spaces created on the stage "are mostly for Maynard"
 He clarifies, "many of these songs are a personal journey for him and when he tries to evoke these feelings in front of the audience, he has to spend a lot of time with the flicker of bright light
 unhen apane liye thode se nijee rikt sthaan kii aavashyaktaa padati he or ve chaaya main kahin adhik sahaj mahasoos karte hai
 "big screens are used to play those" circled clips that are not found in songs such as music videos
 band ne kisi bhi prakaar ke time code ko kabhi istemaal nahin kiya he
 He has always ensured that the video can be changed in the way it is produced, so that there is room for improvement
