 Young's double slit test is the basic form of modern double slit testing
 yah prayog thomas yang ke dwaara 19 veen shatabdi me pradarshit kiya gaya tha
 This experiment has played a major role in the acceptance of the wave theory of light
 khud thomas yang kaa kahana tha ki yah unki sabhi uplabdhiyon me se atyant mahatvapurn siddhi he
 During this period, many scientists such as Robert Hooke, Christian Huygens, and Leonard Oiler, made several proposals for the wave theory of light based on experimental observations
 haalanki, sar izac newton, jinhone prakaash par kai praayogic jaanch kiye the, prakaash kii tarang siddhant ko khaarij kar diya or prakaash kii kanika siddhant viksit ki, jiske anusaar kisi bhi chamakdaar sharir se prakaash chote kanon ke rup main utsarjit hota he or usee rup me prasaarit hota he
 This Newton theory cannot explain many direct contexts such as diffraction
 phir bhi is siddhant ke kai prakhyat samarthak the jaise ki piyer simon laplas tathaa jin baptist baiyat
 While studying medicinal science in Göttingen in 1800, Young presented a letter to the Royal Society, arguing that light also behaves like a wave
 yang ke is vichaar ko kuch maatra me andeh se dekha gaya kyonki yah newton ke kanika siddhant kaa khandan karata tha
 However, he continued to develop his theory
 unhone pani ke tarango kaa istamaal karte hue, un tarango ke gunon kaa varnan kiya
 In 1801, he presented a thesis called "on the theory of light and color" to the Royal Society
 is thisis me yang ne vibhinn kaa vishaleshan diya
 The double-slit experiment is a demonstration of how light and matter can act as metaphors for both waves and particles
 iske alaava, yah kwantum yantric ghatana kii moulik "sambhavya prakruti" ko pradarshit karata he
 In this experiment a coherent light source illuminates two parallel holes in a plate
 in chhedon dwaara guzarane vaale prakaash kaa nirikshan, peeche ek screen par kiya jaataa he
 Due to the contact between the extracted light from both holes, bright and dark bands are produced on the screen
 agar prakaash kano ke gathan se bana he, to in bandon ke pratimaan kaa koi matlab nahi banataa
 This shows that light behaves like waves
 parantu kuch anek prayogo, jaise photo electric effect, se malum pasta he ki prakaash kanon ke samaan bhi vyavhaar karata he
 This is called the "wave-particle duality" of light
 prakaash ke saath-saath kai anya aparmanvik kan jaise electron bhi in gunon ko dharan me rakhte hai
 An important version of this experiment also uses single particles, such as electrons
 is prayog me ek mashin kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jo electron ke kano ko screen ki taraf phenkata he
 This machine acts like a pistol
 electron ke kanon ko do samanaantar chhedon se guzaraaya jaataa he
 These electrons fall on a screen by passing through holes
 yah screen ek photographic film hone ke kaaran, electron kaa is par girnaa hame dikhaai pasta he
 After doing this experiment, it was seen that the same bright and dark bands were formed on the screen as it did on light
 yah prayog electron sahit kai anya kanon tathaa up-kano par kiya ja saktaa he or har baar vahi bandon kaa pattern dikhaa ja saktaa he
 According to quantum mechanical theory these particles fall on different parts of the screen is an unpredictable process
 kan kab or kahaan aa giregaa, is baat kaa andaja nahi lagaaya ja saktaa
 If particles that behave like two waves cancel each other out, it does not mean that the particle disappears; This means that the particle will be visible elsewhere

 sarvoday, angrej lekhak ruskin kii ek pustak antu dis last kaa gandhi ji dwaara gujarati main anudit ek pustak he
 'unto the last' means - even to this end
 sarvoday kaa arth he - sabakaa udai, sabakaa vikaas
 Sarvodaya is the old model of India
 hamaare rishiyon ne gaaya he-"sarvepi sukhin: santu"
 The word Sarvodaya is also not new
 jain muni samantabhadra kehete hai - sarvapadamantakaran nirantan sarvodayan tirthamidan tawaiv
 The principles of "sarvodaya" are inherent in our archaic ideals of "sarva Khalvidam Brahman", "vasudhaiva Kutumbakam", or "soऽham" and "tattvamasi"
 sarvoday samaaj gandhi ke kalpanaao kaa samaaj tha, jiske kendra me bhartiya gram vyavastha thi
 Vinoba ji has said, Sarvodaya means - the advancement of all beings through service
 sarvoday ke vyavhaarik swarup ko ham bahut hd tak vinoba ji ke bhudaan aandolan me dekh sakate he
 As much as the morning person, as much as the evening person - as much as the first person, as much as the last person, it contains the element of equality and advaita, on which the vast realm of Sarvodaya stands
 1 aatm-sanyam 2 exploitative society 3 sarvangin vikaas 4 Governance based on public policy 5 satta kaa vikendrikaran The ideal of "sarvodaya" is Advaita and its policy is coordination
 maanavkrut vishmata kaa vah ant karnaa chahta he or prakritik vishmata ko ghataana chahta he
 For the living, respect and sympathy for every person is the path of Sarvodaya
 jeevamaatr ke liye sahanubhati kaa yah aput jab jivan main pravaahit hota he, tab sarvoday kii lata main surabhipurna suman khilte hai
 Darwin said- "the law of nature is, big fish survive by eating small fish
 " huxley ne kaha-jio or jeene do
 "sarvodaya says-" You live to make others live
 " dusron ko apana banane ke liye prem kaa vistaar karnaa hoga, ahimsa kaa vikaas karnaa hoga or shoshan ko samaapt kar aaj ke saamaajik mulyon main parivartan karnaa hoga
 " "sarvoday" aise vargvihin, jativiheen or shoshanmukt samaaj kii sthapana karnaa chahta he, jisamen prayek vyakti or samooh ko apane sarvangin vikaas kaa saadhan or avasar mili
 Vinoba says- "when we think of Sarvodaya, then the high-altitude emotional system stands like a wall
 use tode bina sarvoday sthapit nahin hoga
 To make Sarvodaya successful, caste discrimination has to be eliminated and economic disparity has to be removed
 inako mitaane se hi sarvoday samaaj banegaa
 " "sarvoday aisi samaajarachna chahta he gimen varna, varg, dharm, jati, bhashaa aadi ke aadhaar par kisi samudaay kaa na to sanhaar ho, na bahishkaar ho
 The structure of Sarvodaya will be such that the creation of all and the power of all will serve the interest of all, in which people of more or less physical ability get equal protection of society and all are entitled to equal remuneration
 vigyaan or loktantr ke is yug main sarv kii kranti kaa hi mulya he or vahi saare vikaas kaa maapdand he
 There is no scope for mutual conflict between capital and intelligence in the revolution of all
 ve samaan str par paraspar poorak shaktiyaan hai
 Naturally, the last person in Sarvodaya's structure is the first authority for the concern of the society
 sarvoday samaaj kii rachana vyaktigat jivan kii shuddhi par hi ho sakati he
 The fasting rules which are the means of "liberation" in personal life are the ones that will be used in social life also, then Sarvodaya society will be formed
 vinoba kehete hai-"sarvoday kii drushti se jo samaaj rachana hogi, uskaa aarambh apane jivan se karnaa hoga
 Sarvodaya will not happen if untruth, violence, accession etc
 occur in private life, because Sarvodaya wants to eradicate the inequality of society with non-violence
 samyavaadee kaa dhyey bhi vishmata mitaanaa he, parantu is achche saadhy ke liye vah chaahe jaisaa saadhan istemaal kar saktaa he, parantu sarvoday ke liye sadhanshuddhi bhi aavashyak he
 " gandhi ji bhi kehete he-"samaajwaad kaa prarambh pehle samaajawaadee se hota he
 If there is any such socialist, then zero can be increased on it
 har shunya se uski keemat dasguna bad jaaegi, lekin agar pehla ank shunya ho, to uske aage kitne hi shunya badaye jaaen, uski keemat phir bhi shunya hi rahegi
 " isiilie gandhi ji satya, ahimsa, astey, aparigrah, brahmacharya, aswad, sharirshram, nirbhayata, sarvadharmasamanvay, asprishyata or swadeshi aadi vraton ke paalan par itnaa jor dete the
 Equality of remuneration - Salary to barber as much as salary to lawyer
 "antu dis last" kaa yah tatv sarvoday main purnat: gruhit he
 Communism also wants equality in remuneration
 yah tatv donon main samaan he
 Lack of competition - Competition gives rise to conflict
 samyavaadee ke liye sangharsh to param tatv hi he
 But Sarvodaya considers cooperation not struggle
 sangharsh main hinsa he
 The entire building of Sarvodaya stands on the foundation of non-violence
 sadhanshuddhi - samyawad saadhy kii prapti ke liye sadhanshuddhi ko aavashyak nahin maanata
 Instrumentation is the key in Sarvodaya
 saadhy bhi shuddh or saadhan bhi shuddh
 Trusteeship plans to benefit from genetic rites - says Vinoba - "" Asymmetry of property arises due to artificial arrangement, leave it as if the inequality of human physical and intellectual power cannot be completely overcome
 
 shikshan or niyaman se yah vishmata kuch ansh tak kam kii ja sakati
 But the absolute absence of this asymmetry in the ideal situation cannot be imagined
 isliye sharir, buddhi or sampatti in teenon main se jo jise praapt ho, use yahi samajhnaa chahie ki vah sabake hit ke liye hi mili he
 This is the spirit of trust
 apni shakti or sampatti kaa trustee ke naate hi manushyamaatr ke hit ke liye prayog karnaa chahie
 Trusteeship entails a feeling of imperfection
 samyawad main anuvanshikta ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 His policy has been to destroy the aristocracy
 vikendrikaran - sarvoday satta or sampatti kaa vikendrikaran chahta he jisase shoshan or daman se bachaa ja sake
 In this era of centralized industrialization, it has become even more necessary
 vikendrikaran kii yahi prakriya jab satta ke vishay main lagu kii jaati he, tab isaki nishpatti hoti he shashanmukt samaaj main
 Even in the communist imagination, the state is going to melt at the end like ghee kept in the scorching heat
 parantu uske pehle use jame hue ghi kii tarah hi nahin, balki tratski ke sir par maare hue hathode kii tarah, thos or majboot hona chahie
 
 parantu gandhi ji ne aadi, madhya or ant teenon sthitiyon main vikendrikaran or shashanmuktata kii baat kahi he
 This is the path to Sarvodaya
 is samay sansar main utpaadan ke sadhano ke swaamitv kii do paddatiyon prachlit hai - nijee swaamitv or sarkaar swaamitv 
 Private ownership is capitalism, government ownership is communism
 poonjeewaad main shoshan he, samyawad main daman
 The tradition of India, its genius and its condition, all three require that they develop a third method of political and economic organization, so as to benefit from the "private aggression" of capitalism and the "collective interest" of communism, but their Defects can be avoided
 gandhi ji kii "trustiship" or "gramswarajya" kii kalpana or vinoba kii is kalpana par aadhaarit "gramdaan-gram swarajya" kii vistrut yojana main, donon ke dosha kaa parihaar or gunon kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 Here the ownership is neither private, nor government, but the village, which is autonomous

 He was the beloved son of his father, so where his brother used to work in the fields, Ranjha was playing the flute, living the life of comfort
 uski bhabhiyon ne use khaanaa dene se inkaar kar diya or vah ghar chhodkar nikal padaa or chalate-chalate hir ke gaanv pahunch gaya
 He fell in love with Heer there
 hir ne use apane pita kii gaay-bhaisen charaane kaa kaam diya
 Hearing Ranjhe's flute, she became enchanted and fell in love with him
 vah ek-duusare se chup-chup kar milane lage
 One day he is seen by Heer's jealous uncle, Kaido, and his father and mother forcefully marry Heer to a man named Saida Kheda
 raanjhe kaa dil tut jaataa he or vah jog lene ke liye baba gorakhnath ke prasiddh dere, tilla jogiyaan, chalaa jaataa he
 Gorakhnath's disciples are called kanfte because they wear earrings with their ears pierced
 ranjha bhi kaan chhidaakar 'alakh niranjan' kaa jaap karata puure punjab main ghumta he
 Finally, one day he reaches the village of Heer's in-laws
 hir-raanjha donon hir ke gaanv aa jate hai jahaan hir ke maan-pita unhen shaadi karne kii ijazat de dete hai lekin hir kaa chachaa kaido unhen kush dekhakar jalataa he
 On the wedding day, Kaido adds poison to Heer's dinner
 yah khabar sunakar ranjha use bachane dauda aata he lekin bahut der ho chuki hoti he
 Ranjha, after suffering more than he can tolerate, consumes the same poisonous laddu and succumbs to Heer's side
 unhen hir ke shahar, jhang, main dafanaaya jaataa he or har taraf se log unke mazaar par aakar unhen yaad karte hai
 The Damodar poet, lived in the reign of Akbar and describes himself as a friend of Heer's father Chuchak and says that this is all my eyes saw

 It was due to the Salt Yatra that the British realized that now their rule could not last long and they would have to share the power of the Indians too
 is lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue british sarkaar ne landan main gol mej sammelnon kaa aayojan shuru kiya
 Three round table conferences were organized by the British government under a series of conferences between 1930–32 to discuss constitutional reforms in India
 ye sammelan may 1930 main simon ayog dwaara prastut kii gayi report ke aadhaar par sanchalit kiye gaye the
 The demand for Swaraj, or self-governance, was increasing rapidly in India
 1930 ke dashak tak, kai british rajanetaaon kaa maananaa tha ki bharat main ab swa-shashan lagu hona chahie
 However, there were considerable ideological differences between the Indian and British political parties, which could not be resolved by the summons
 pehla gol mej sammelan navambar 1930 main yojit kiya gaya jisamen desh ke pramukh netaa shaamil nahin hue, isi kaaran antat: yah baithak nirarthak sabit hui
 It was officially launched by George v on 12 November 1930 and presided over by the British Prime Minister, Ramsay mcdonald
 teen british raajnneetik dalon kaa pratinidhitiv solah pratinidhiyon dwaara kiya gaya
 57 political leaders from India ruled by the British and 16 representatives from the princely states participated
 haalanki, bhartiya rashtriya congress or vyapaarik netaaon ne sammelan main bhaag nahin liya
 Many of them were jailed for participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement
 janvari 1931 main gandhi ji ko jail se reeha kiya gaya
 The following month he had several long meetings with the Viceroy
 inhen baithkon ke baad gandhi-irvin samjhaute par sahmati bani jisaki sharto main savinay avagya andolan ko waapas lenaa, saare kaidiyon kii rihaai or tateey ilaakon main namak utpaadan kii anumati dena shaamil tha
 Radical nationalists criticized the deal because Gandhiji could not obtain assurances of political independence for Indians from the Viceroy
 gandhi ji ko is sambhavit lakshya kii prapti ke liye keval vaartaon kaa aashwaasan mila tha
 The idea of forming an All India Federation remained the main point of discussion
 sammelan main bhaag lene vaale sabhi samoohon ne is avadharana kaa samarthan kiya
 The responsibilities from the executive meeting to the assembly meeting were discussed and Ambedkar demanded a separate political representative for the untouchables
 yah vastav me dalito ke liye uphaar tha
 They too could not be viewed in this way
 doosraa gol mej sammelan 1931 ke aakhir main landan main yojit hua
 Mr
 Gandhi was leading the Congress in that
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki unki party puure bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 The claim was challenged by three parties
 muslim lig kaa kahana tha ki vah muslim alpsankhyakon ke hit main kaam karti he
 The princely states claimed that the Congress had no authority over the territory under their control
 teesri chunauti tej-tarraar vakil or vichaarak bi aar ambedkar kii taraf se thi jinka kahana tha ki gandhi ji or congress party nichali jatiyon kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte
 This conference in London could not reach any conclusion, so Gandhiji had to return empty-handed
 bharat lautne par unhone savinay avagya andolan shuru kar diya
 The new Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, had absolutely no sympathy for Gandhiji
 apni bahan ko likhe ek nijee khat main wellingdon ne likhaa tha ki- However, in the new Government of India Act in 1935, the assurance of limited representative governance was expressed
 do saal baad simit matadhikaar ke aadhikaar par hue chunaavon main congress ko jabardast safalata mili
 Congress representatives came to power in 8 out of 11 provinces which functioned under the supervision of the British Governor
 congress mantrimandalon ke satta main aane ke do saal baad, sitambar 1939 main doosraa vishwa yuddh shuru ho gaya
 Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were both staunch critics of Hitler and the Natsis
 tadnurup, unhone faisalaa liya ki agar angrej yuddh samaapt hone ke baad bharat ko swatantraaa dene par raji hon to congress unke yudddh prayaason main sahaayta de sakati he
 The government rejected their proposal
 iske virodh main congressi mantrimandalon ne oktober 1939 main istifa de diya
 The second round table conference differed in three ways from the first round table conference
 duusare sammelan ke prarambh hone tak: During the conference, Gandhiji could not reach any agreement with the Muslims on Muslim representation and security measures
 sammelan ke ant main ramse mcdonald ne alpsankhyak pratinidhitiv ke sambandh main ek sampradayik nirnay kii ghoshnaa kii or usamen yah praavdhaan rakhaa gaya ki raajnneetik dalon ke bich kisi bhi prakaar ke mukt samjhaute ko is nirnay ke sthaan par lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Gandhi specifically opposed the issue of rating the untouchables as a minority belonging to the Hindu community
 unka achhuton ke netaa bi

 The two leaders eventually resolved the problem through the Poona Pact of 1932
 march 1940 main muslim lig ne pakistan ke naam se ek pruthak raashtra kii sthapana kaa prastaav paarit kiya or use apana lakshya ghoshit kar diya
 Now the political landscape had become quite complex: the struggle was no longer Indian versus British
 ab yah congress, muslim lig or british shashan, teen dhuriyon ke bich kaa sangharsh tha
 At the same time, an all-party government was in power in Britain, in which the Labor Party members were sympathetic towards Indian aspirations, but the head of the government was Prime Minister Winston Churchill Cutter
 unka kahana tha ki unhen samraat kaa sarvocch mantri isliye nahin niyukt kiya gaya he ki vah british samrajya ko tukade-tukade kar den
 In the spring of 1942, Churchill sent one of his ministers, Sir Stafford Cripps, to India to find a way out of the agreement with Gandhiji and the Congress
 krips ke saath vaarta main congress ne is baat par jor diya ki agar dhuree shaktiyon se bharat kii raksha ke liye british shashan congress kaa samarthan chahta he to vysarai ko sabase pehle apni kaaryakari parishad main kisi bhartiya ko ek raksha sadsy ke rup main niyukt karnaa chahie
 The negotiations broke down over this
 jis se kahin rajnetik vichaar bane
 The third and final session began on 17 November 1932
 maatr 46 pratinidhiyon ne is sammelan main bhaag liya kyonki adhiktar mukhya bhartiya raajnneetik pramukh is sammelan main maujuud nahin the
 The Labor Party of Britain and the Indian National Congress refused to participate in the session
 is sammelan main ek college chaatr choudhary rahamat ali ne vibhajit bharat ke muslim bhaag kaa naam "pakistan" rakhaa
 He coined the term 'P' from Punjab, 'A' from Punjab, 'K' from Kashmir, "S" from Sindh and "tan" from Balochistan

 From September 1931 to March 1933, under the supervision of Samuel Hoare, a draft of the proposed reforms was made; Based on which the Government of India Act of 1935 was made

 shivaji maharaj in sabhi jati ke logon ko lekar maawalon naam dekar sabhi ko sangathit kiya or unase sampark kar unke pradesh se parichit ho gaye the
 He had started the construction of the fort by bringing Maval youths
 maawalon kaa sahyog shivaji maharaj ke liye baad main utana hi mahatvapurn sabit hua jitna shershah suri ke liye afagaanon kaa saath
 At that time Bijapur was troubled by mutual struggle and Mughal invasion
 bijapur ke sultan adilshaah ne bahut se durgon se apni sena hataakar unhen sthaneey shaskaon yaa samanton ke haath saunp diya tha
 When Adilshah fell ill, anarchy spread in Bijapur and Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of the opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 shivaji maharaj ne iske baad ke dinon main bijapur ke durgon par adhikaar karne kii niti apanaai
 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Shivaji sent his envoy to Sultan Adilshah and informed him that he was ready to pay better money than the first fortress and handed over this area to him
 unhone adilshaah ke darbariyon ko pehle hi rishwat dekar apane paksh main kar liya tha or apane darbariyon kii salaah ke mutabik adilshaah ne shivaji maharaj ko us durg kaa adhipati bana diya
 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset
 usne shahji raaje ko apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha
 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe
 usake baad aurangzeb ne mirzaraja jaisingh ko bhejkar 23 kilon par kabja kiya baad main shiji maharaj ke mawala tanaji malusre ne kondhana durg par kabja kiya par us yuddh main vah viragati ko praapt hua uski yaad main kondana par adhikaar karne ke baad uskaa naam singhgarh rakhaa gaya
 Shahaji Raje was given the title of Poona and Soupa and the fortress of Soupa was in the hands of his relative Baji Mohite
 shivaji maharaj ne raat ke samay soopa ke durg par akraman karke durg par adhikaar kar liya or baaji mohite ko shahji raaje ke paas karnataka bhej diya
 Some part of his army also came in the service of Shivaji Maharaj
 isi samay purandar ke kiledaar kii mrityu ho gai or kile ke uttaradhikaar ke liye uske teenon beton main ladaai chhid gai
 Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar on the invitation of two brothers and, taking recourse to diplomacy, he imprisoned all the brothers
 is tarah purandar ke kile par bhi unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed
 1647 isvi tak ve chaakan se lekar nira tak ke bhubhag ke bhi adhipati ban chuke the
 With his increased military power, Shivaji Maharaj planned to enter the plains
 ek ashwarohi sena kaa gathan kar shivaji maharaj ne aabaaji sonder ke netritv main konkan ke viruddh ek sena bheji
 Abaji captured nine other fortifications including Konkan
 iske alaava taala, mosmala or raiti ke durg bhi shivaji maharaj ke adheen aa gaye the
 All the property looted was kept safe in Raigad
 kalyaan ke governor ko mukt kar shivaji maharaj ne kolaba kii ore rukh kiya or yahan ke pramukhon ko videshiyon ke kilaaf yuddh ke liye uksaaya
 Sultan of Bijapur was already in a rage before Shivaji Maharaj's antics
 usne shivaji maharaj ke pita ko bandi banane kaa aadesh de diya
 Shahaji Raje was in Karnataka at the time and was taken prisoner by a treacherous assistant Baji Ghorpade and brought to Bijapur
 un par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone qutubashah kii seva praapt karne kii koshish kii thi jo golconda kaa shaasha tha or is kaaran adilshaah kaa shatru
 After the mediation of two chieftains of Bijapur, Shahaji Maharaj was freed on the condition that he would control Shivaji Maharaj
 agle chaar varshon tak shivaji maharaj ne bijipur ke kilaaf koi akraman nahin kiya
 During this time he organized his army
 shahji kii mukti kii sharton ke mutabik shivaji rajane bijapur ke kshetron par akraman to nahin kiya par unhone dakshin-pashchim main apni shakti badhaane kii cheshtaa kii
 But in this order the state of Javali was acting as a hindrance
 yah rajya satara ke sudur uttar pashchim main vama or krishna nadi ke bich main sthit tha
 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army
 chandrarav more or uske donon putron ne shivaji ke saath ladaai kii par ant main ve bandi bana liye gaye par chandrarav bhaag gaya
 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion
 isse shivaji ko us durg main sangrahit aath vanshon kii sampatti mil gai
 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army
 shivaji ke bijapur tathaa mughal donon shatru the
 At that time, Shahzada Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Deccan
 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin
 iske parinamswaroop aurangzeb shivaji se khafaa ho gaya or maitri vaarta samaapt ho gai
 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira
 par zanjeera ke siddiyon ke saath unki ladaai kai dinon tak chali
 After this Shivaji himself invaded Janjira and took control of South Konkan and collected annual tax from the Portuguese of Daman
 kalyaan tathaa bhiwandi par adhikaar karne ke baad vahaan nausainik adda bana liya
 By this time, Shivaji had become the owner of 40 fortifications
 idhar aurangzeb ke agra laut jane ke baad bijapur ke sultan ne bhi raahat kii saans lee
 Now Shivaji was the most powerful enemy of Bijapur
 shahji ko pehle hi apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha gaya tha par shahji ne isamen apni asamarthta jaahir kii
 The Sultan of Bijapur sent Abdullah Bhatari against Shivaji to deal with Shivaji
 afajal ne 12 xxrep 4 0 sainikon ke saath 1659 main kooch kiya
 Destroying the temples of Tuljapur, he came to Shiraval, 30 km north of Satara
 par shivaji pratapgarh ke durg par hi rahe
 Afzal Khan sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar for a treaty
 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya 
 After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji took control of the fort of Panhala
 iske baad pavangadh or vasantgarh ke durgon par adhikaar karne ke saath hi saath unhone rustam khan ke akraman ko vifal bhi kiya
 With this they also captured Rajapur and Dawul
 ab bijapur main aatank kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya or vahaan ke samanton ne aapasi matbhed bhulaakar shivaji par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 2 October 1665, the Bijapuri army captured the Panhala fort
 shivaji sankat main funs chuke the par raatri ke andhkaar kaa laabh uthaakar ve bhaagane main safal rahe
 The Sultan of Bijapur, taking command himself, withdrew his authority over Panhala, Pawangarh, looted Rajapur and killed the head of Shringargarh
 isi samay karnataka main siddijohar ke vidroh ke kaaran bijapur ke sultan ne shivaji ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Shivaji's father Shahaji acted as a mediator in this treaty
 san 1662 main hui is sandhi ke anusaar shivaji ko bijapur ke sultan dwaara swatantra shaasha kii manyata mili
 According to this treaty, the area ranging from Kalyan in the north to Ponda in the south and from Indapur in the east to Davul in the west came under Shivaji's control
 shivaji kii sena main is samay tak 3 xxrep 4 0 paidal or 1000 ghudsavaar ho gaye the
 After the end of the race to become king in North India, Aurangzeb's attention shifted to the south
 wo shivaji kii badhati prabhutaa se parichit tha or usne shivaji par niyantran rakhane ke udyeshy se apane mamaa shysta khan ko dakshin kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Shaiska Khan took 1,50,000 fos and took control of the fort of Supan and Chakan and reached Poona
 usne 3 saal tak mawal main lutmar ki
 One night Shivaji attacked him with his 350 Mavalos
 shysta to khidki ke raste batch nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa par use isi kram main apni chaar anguliyon se haath dhonaa padaa
 The sons of Shaista Khan, and forty guards and countless soldiers were slaughtered
 is ghatana ke baad aurangzeb ne shysta ko dakkan ke badale bengal kaa soobedaar bana diya or shahjada muajjam shysta kii jagah lene bheja gaya
 This victory increased Shivaji's reputation
 6 saal shaista khan ne apni 15 xxrep 4 0 fuj lekar raja shivaji kaa pura mulukh jalaakar tabah kar diya tha
 Therefore, Shivaji started looting in the Mughal territories to recover his damages
 surat us samay pashchimi vyapaariyon kaa garh tha or hindustani musalamaanon ke liye haj par jane kaa dwaar
 It was a prosperous city and its port was very important
 shivaji ne chaar hajaar kii sena ke saath 1664 main chah dinon tak surat ke dhanadya vyapaariyon ko lutaa
 They did not rob the common man and then returned
 is ghatana kaa zikr dach tathaa angrejon ne apane lekhon main kiya he
 By that time, European traders had settled in India and other Asian countries
 nadir shah ke bharat par akraman karne tak kisi bhi europea shakti ne bhartiya mughal samrajya par akraman karne kii nahin sochi thi
 Disgusted by the loot of Shivaji in Surat, Aurangzeb appointed Gaiyasuddin Khan as a faujdar of Surat in place of Inayat Khan
 or shahjada muajjam tathaa upasenapati raja jaswant singh kii jagah diler khan or raja jaisingh kii niyukti kii gai
 King Jai Singh attacked Shivaji with the support of Sultan of Bijapur, European powers and small feudatories
 is yuddh main shivaji ko haani hone lagi or haar kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue shivaji ne sandhi kaa prastaav bheja
 According to this treaty in June 1665, Shivaji will give 23 fortifications to the Mughals and thus only 12 fort will be left with him
 in 23 durgon se hone vaali aamadani 4 lakh hun salanaa thi
 The areas of Balaghat and Konkan will be given to Shivaji, but he will have to pay 40 lakh Huns in 13 installments in return
 iske alaava prativarsh 5 lakh hun kaa rajasav bhi ve denge
 Shivaji himself will be free from being in Aurangzeb's court, but his son Shambhaji will have to fight in the Mughal court
 bijapur ke kilaaf shivaji mughalon kaa saath denge
 Shivaji was called to Agra where he felt that he was not getting proper respect
 iske kilaaf unhone apana rosh bhare darbar main dikhaaya or aurangzeb par vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aurangzeb was angered by this and he saw Shivaji being detained and guarded by 5000 soldiers
 kuch hi dinon baad raja shivaji ko maar daalane kaa iraadaa aurangzeb kaa tha
 But both Shivaji and Sambhaji, with their courage and courage, managed to escape from it
 sambhaaji ko mathura main ek vishwasi brahman ke yahan chhod shivaji maharaj banaras, gayi, puri hote hue sakushal rajgad pahunch gaye 
 This gave the Marathas a new life
 aurangzeb ne jaisingh par shaq karke uski hatya vish dekar karvaa daali
 Shivaji signed a second treaty with the Mughals in 1668 after Jaswant Singh took the initiative
 aurangzeb ne shivaji ko raja kii manyata di
 Shivaji's son Shambhaji received a mansabdari of 5000 and Shivaji was returned to the districts of Poona, Chakan and Soupa

 jab ye baat shivaji tak pahunchi kii mughal sardaar aise dhamkee de rahe he tab shivaji ne ise ek chunauti ke rup me liya or kaha kii ab wo us rajya ke brahamn se hi abhishek karavaayenge jo mughalon ke adhikaar main he
 shivaji ke nijee sachiv balaji ji ne kaashi main teen duto ko bheja, cunki kaashi mughal samrajya ke adheen tha
 jab duuton ne sandesh diya to kaashi ke brahamn kaaphi prasann huye
 kintu mughal sainiko ko yah baat pataa chal gai tab un brahmano ko pakad liya
 parantu yukti purvak un brahmanon ne mughal sannico ke samaksh un duuton se kaha ki shivaji koun he ham nahin jaanate he

 ham to tirth yatra par ja rahe hai or kashika koi anya brahman bhi rajbhishek nahin karegaa jab tak raja kaa purna parichay na ho at: aap waapas ja sakate hai
 mughal sardaar ne khush hoke brahmano ko chod diya or duto ko pakad kar aurangzeb ke paas dilli bhejne kii sochi par wo bhi chup ke se nikal bhaage
 waapas laut kar unhone ye baat balaji aav tathaa shivaji ko bataai
 parantu aashcharya janak rup se do din baad vahi brahman apane shishyon ke saath raigarh pahuchen ore shivaji kaa rajbhishek kiya
 After this, the Mughals tried to divide and even after the coronation of Shivaji, threatened the Brahmins of Poona that they should not accept Shivaji as the king
 So that people do not even consider it !! But they did not work
 Shivaji established the Ashtapradhan Mandal
 Apart from the envoys, representatives of various states, foreign traders were also invited to this ceremony

 At that time, Sambhaji inherited Shivaji's succession
 shivaji ke jyeshtha putr sambhaji the or dusi patni se rajaraam naam ek doosraa putr tha
 At that time Rajaram was only 10 years old, so the Marathas accepted Shambhaji as the king

 Bhushan's description of heroism is multidimensional
 ise ham yudhmulak, dharmamoolak, danamoolak, stutimulak aadi roopon main dekh sakate hai
 Permanent expressions of Veer Rasa are excellent form of zeal, challenging the enemy in the battlefield, Shivaji was a heroic person and his inspiration generated a sense of valor in the hearts of Hindu soldiers
 bhushan ne un sainikon kii veerta kaa varnan karte hue kaha haih Bhushan's war description is very lively and natural
 yuddh ke utsaah se yukt senaaon kaa ran prasthaan yuddh ke baajon kaa ghor garjan, ran bhoomi main hathiyaaron kaa ghaat-pratighaat, shur veeron kaa parakram or kaayron kii bhaypurna sthiti aadi drishyon kaa chithran atyant prabhaavshaalee dhang se prastut kiya gaya he
 See a picture of Shivaji's army departing for the battle - kavi ne shivaji ko dharm va samskruti ke unnayak ke rup main ankit kiya he
 Shivaji fought against Muslims and protected Hindus
 kavi ne shivabaavanee main kaha he :- The poets of Veer Rasa have shown their hero to be extremely rich
 bhushan ne shivaji kii daanveerta kaa atishyoktipurna varnan kiya he
 The digestive receives more donations than he wishes
 shivastuti main kavi ne shivaji kii apurv daansheeltaa kaa varnan kiya he
 According to Bhushan, Shivaji is the ocean of mercy
 ve sharnaagat par dayaa karte the
 He instructed his soldiers not to harass women and children
 vastutah bhushan ne shivaji ke parakram, shaury va aatank kaa prabhaavshaalee varnan kiya he
 He has revealed the form of Shivaji's Dharmakshak, Danveer and Dayawan
 inke viraras se sambandhit pad muktak hai
 Among them, there is subsistence of Ozgun
 hindi ke anya vir ras ke kavi shringaar kaa varnan bhi saath main karte hai
 While the poetry of Bhushan is left with the adornment spirit
 atah kaha ja saktaa he ki bhushan viraras ke shreshth kavi hai
 Bhushan composed his poetry in Braj language
 ve sarvapratham kavi hai jinhone braj bhashaa ko vir ras kii kavita ke liye apanaaya
 Today's philosophy is everywhere in his Braj language in favor of Veer Ras
 bhushan kii braj bhashaa main urdu, arabi, farsi aadi bhashaaon ke shabdon kii bharmaar he
 The words Jung, Aftab, Army etc
 have been used openly
 shabdon kaa chayan vir ras ke anukool he
 Idioms and proverbs are used beautifully
 vyakaran kii avyavashtha, shabdon ko tod-marod, vaakya vinyas kii gadabadi aadi ke hote hue bhi bhushan kii bhashaa badi shashakt or pravahamayi he
 Yes, due to the use of the words Prakrit and Apabhramsa, she has become a bit confused
 bhushan kii style apane vishay ke anukool he
 He is vigorous and perfectly suited for the euphemism of Veer Ras
 atah unki style ko vir ras kii oj purna style kaha ja saktaa he
 Effectiveness, pictorialism and plausibility are the main features of Bhushan's style
 '=== ras ===bhushan kii kavita kii vir ras ke varnan main bhushan hindi sahitya main adwitiya kavi hai
 Along with Veer, rasadra Bhavya-gruesome etc
 juices have also got place
 bhushan ne shringaar ras kii bhi kuch kavitaayen likhi hai, kintu shringaar ras ke varnan ne bhi unki vir ras kii evam ruchi kaa spasht prabhaav dikh padataa he - Bhushan's verses plan is Rasa-friendly
 doha, kavitt, savaiya, chappay aadi unke pramukh chand hai
 Like traditional poets, Bhushan has given immense importance to ornaments
 unki kavita main praayah sabhi alankaar paae jate hai
 Linguistics has gained precedence over semantics
 yamak alankaar kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie- Bhushan is a singer of national sentiment
 unki vaani peedit praja ke prati ek apurv aashvsaan hai
 His time was ruled by Aurangzeb
 aurangzeb ke samay se mughal vaibhav va satta kii pakad kamjor hoti ja rahi thi
 Aurangzeb's harshness and hatred towards Hindus drove him away from the public
 sankat kii is ghadi main bhushan ne do rashtriya purushon - shivaji va chhatrasaal ke madhyam se puure raashtra main rashtriya bhaavana sanchaarit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Bhushan has made the words of the then public the basis of his poems
 inhone swadeshnurag, samskruti anuraag, sahitya anuraag, mahapurushon ke prati anuraag, utsaah aadi kaa varnan kiya he
 Bhushan had a deep affection for his country
 unki drushti puure desh par thi
 He saw that Aurangzeb was destroying the temples, and his mind revolted
 shivaji ke madhyam se unhone apni vaani prakat kii - Bhushan used culture to bring the lost force to the Hindus
 inhone anek devi-devataaon ke kaaryon kaa ullekh kiya tathaa un mahan kaaryon kii koti main shivaji ke kaaryon kii gananaa kii he
 Shivaji has been inscribed as a symbol of religion and culture- bhushan ne vedashastron kaa gahan adhyayan kiya he
 He composed his poetry on the basis of ancient literature, his literary love is a reflection of his national spirit
 bhushan ne ateet va vartmaan ke mahapurushon va jananaayakon ke prati shrriddha vyakt kii he
 He mentions all of Shivaji and Chhatrasal Bundela or any other character only in those episodes which were related to national sentiment
 jaise : There is a sense of consciousness in national literature
 bhushan ke sahitya main sajivta, sphurti va umang kaa bhav he
 The poet describes Shivaji's struggle with the Mughals in an enthusiastic style: - nihsandeh, bhushan kaa kavy rashtriya chetana se ot-prot he
 He is a poet of the national spirit in the true sense
 bhushan kaa hindi sahitya main ek vishisht sthaan hai
 He was the unique poet of Veer Ras
 reeti kaaleen kaviyon main ve pehle kavi the jinhone haas-vilaas kii apeksha rashtriya-bhaavana ko pramukhataa pradaan kii
 He taught the heroism of the then helpless Hindu society through his poetry and presented before him a model for defense
 ve nihsandeh raashtra kii amar dharohar hai

 In various literary works, eight other books authored by you are adorned by Sanskrit Vadmaya
 inhone rugveda kii anek kavitaaon kaa saras hindi kavyanuwaad bhi kiya tha
 Kalanath Shastri has written on his work- {citation} - "in March 2003, the Indian Council of Philosophical Research in Delhi held a huge scholarly seminar to congratulate him on completing 80 years, in which philosophers, historians, Sanskrit-mystics around the world , Writer, poet etc
 were present
 unke sarjanaatmak or vimarshatmak vaidushya ke ayaamon par teen din tak charchaa hui thi
 The research articles read in that seminar also appeared in the booklet
 hindi main bhi ek granth us sangoshtee ke nishkarshon ko shaamil kar nikaala gaya, jiskaa sheershak tha ‘avyay : acharya govind chandra pande kaa sarjanaatmak avdaan’ 2005:, kintu usamen bhi un ke krititv kaa puraa chitra nahin tha, kyonki uskaa falak bahut vyapak he
 He wrote more than fifty books on ten fifteen subjects in ancient history, Buddhist culture, Vedic poetry, value epics, history philosophy, Indian philosophy, Shankaracharya, comparative religion, comparative aesthetics etc
, were in English, Hindi and Sanskrit trio
 anuwaad alag the
 " "darshan, itihaas or sanskrit ke gahan gyaan ne inase jo granth likhwaaye, unamem gunta, praudhata or sankshep main baat kehane kii pravanta hona swaabhaavik tha
 In his texts printed from the Rajasthan Hindi Granth Academy, 'price Mimamsa' reflects all these characteristics
 " "his treatises on Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist India are considered excellent
 jyotish par bhi unka adhikaar tha
 In later days, his book 'vedic Culture' written to present all-round discourse of Vedic literature is also a peak level text
 yah granth jab likhaa ja rahaa tha, main inke nikat sampark main tha, kyonki inkaa yah shauk suprasiddh tha ki elahabaad main rahete hue apane janmdin par elahabaad museum main desh ke shikharstha manishiyon kii kisi na kisi vishay par ek rashtriya sangoshtee avashya hi yojit hoti thi
 He used to call half-baked people like me
 maine is granth kaa sheershak sujhaayaa tha ‘vaidic vaanmay’, par unhone ‘vaidic samskruti’ naam kyon rakhaa, iskaa auchity unhone yah bataaya ki is main upanishad vaanmay kaa bhi puraa vimarsh he
 This title can only contain both
 inhone vahiin bataaya tha ki netaji subhash chandra bose ke mitra kshetresh babu se ye sanskrit padhe the or unke saamne bhi unki kakshaayen, unke aadesh par ye sanskrit madhyam main hi padhaate the
 From this you can guess to what extent they had authority over Sanskrit
 aaj shaayad desh main chaar-paanch vidvan hi us kad-lathi ke bache hon
 " "prasiddh angreji kaviyon kii kavitaaon kaa sanskrit main anuwaad ‘astachalium’ or praakrit gaatha saptshati kaa hindi ke dohon main anuwaad ‘mahilaayein’ sheershak se unhone nikaala
 " "tulanaatmak dharm par sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay kaashi main die inke sanskrit smarak bhaashan kaa grathakar prakaashan hua he ‘ek sad wipra bahudhaa vadanti’ sheershak se
 In this, the discussion of religion that he has covered, from the concept of religion in the history of human beings, to the interpretation of religions that make religion a sect
 koi sanskrit-pandit bhi aisa granth likh paae, yah kam hi sambhav he
 More wonderful than this is their comparative aesthetics, titled 'aesthetic Dissertation:'
 isamen unani saundaryashastra se lekar bom garton kii german kala paribhaashaon se hote hue sanskrit kavyashastra ko lapet kar francisi kroche or astitvvaad tak ye apane vimarsh ko le aae hai
 It is difficult to write all this in Sanskrit, although Sanskrit is the only language in the world in which words can be formed for concepts around the world
 aise shabd banaate-banaate inhone, germany ke ek saundaryashastri bom garton kaa naam bhi sanskrit main utaar daalaa ‘vrikshodyan’! !!" {uddhran-ant} 1
