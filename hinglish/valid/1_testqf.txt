 The movement for the creation of the Jan Lokpal Bill started in its all-india form on 5 April 2011 with a hunger strike by social activist Anna Hazare and his colleagues at Jantar Mantar, including Magsaysay Award winner Arvind Kejriwal, India's first woman Administrative officer Kiran Bedi, renowned populist lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev, founder of Patanjali Yogpeeth, etc
 sanchaar sadhano ke prabhaav ke kaaran is anshan kaa prabhaav samooche bharat main fail gaya or iske samarthan main log sadakon par bhi utarane lage
 He had demanded the Government of India to form a strong anti-corruption Lokpal Bill and had also given a draft of Lokpal Bill to the Government in accordance with his demand
 kintu manmohan singh ke netritv vaali tatkaaleen sarkaar ne iske prati nakaaratmak ravaiya dikhaaya or isaki upeksha kii
 As a result, his attitude towards the fast started also remained neglected
 kintu is anshan ke andolan kaa rup lene par bharat sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main ek samiti banaakar sambhavit khatre ko taala or 16 agast tak sansad main lokapal vidheyak paas karaane kii baat sweekaar kar lee
 The bill presented by the government in the monsoon session beginning in August was weak and completely opposite to the Jan Lokpal
 anna hajaare ne iske khilaaf apane purv ghoshit tithi 16 agast se punah anshan par jane kii baat duharai
 The government stuck many obstacles in its path and arrested Anna Hazare and his associates on 16 August
 kintu isse andolan pure desh main bhadak uthaa
 a large number of dharnas, demonstrations and fasts were organized continuously for the next 12 hearts across the country
 antat sansad dwaara anna kii teen sharton par sahamati kaa prastaav paas karne ke baad 28 agast ko anna ne apana anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna Hazare started a fast unto death on 5 April 2011 in protest against government inaction demanding the creation of a strong Lokpal Bill
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf unki is muhim main arvind kejariwal, kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, baba ramdev evam anya anek prasiddh samajasevi shaamil the
 The government continued to neglect it
 is anshan ko bharat evam sheeghra hi vishwa ke sanchaar madhyamon main vistrut rup se prakashit or prasaarit kiya jane laga
 This ongoing effort against corruption soon got widespread public support
 bharat ke praayah sabhi shaharon main yuva sadakon par utar aae evam iske samarthan main pradarshan kiya tathaa parche baante
 Concerned over the spread of Anna Hazare's fast as a nationwide mass movement, the government immediately announced a committee to draft the Jan Lokpal Bill
 usne 16 agast se pehle sansad main ek majboot lokapal vidheyak paas karaane par bhi sahmati prakat kar di
 In this way, this fast came to an end and the mass movement that flourished against corruption ended with the hope of building a strong Lokpal
 kintu sarkari manshaa sandigdh thi isliye anna hajaare ne saath hi ghoshnaa kii ki yadi aagaamee 15 agast tak apekshit lokapal vidheyak nirmit nahin hua to ve 16 agast se punah anshan par jaayenge
 The government announced the creation of a 10-member Lokpal draft construction committee, in accordance with the terms of the cessation of Anna Hazare's fast in April
 isamen sarkaar ke 5 evam naagarik samaaj ke 5 pratinidhi rakhe gaye
 Anna Hazare accepted a minister to be the chairman of the committee, not opposing the logic of compulsion of the constitutional provisions of the government
 kintu kapil sibbal ke netritv vaali is samiti ke mantriyon ne apni manamaani kii
 There was opposition between the civil society representatives and the government over the issue of bringing the Prime Minister and judges under the Lokpal
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bhavishya main kaanoon banane ke liye naagarik samaaj kii raay nahin lee jaaegi
 Finally, the ministers refused to accept all the important suggestions of the Jan Lokpal presented by Anna Hazare
 dikhaave ke liye jan lokapal ke ve sabhi bindu maan liye gaye jo sarkari mantriyon or saansadon, evam nyayadhishon ko lokapal kii pahunch se baahar rakhte the
 Finally disappointed with the attitude of government ministers, Anna Hazare's colleagues drafted the Jan Lokpal draft separately
 or is tarah samiti ne do masaude kaa nirmaan kiya jise kendriya mantrimandal ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 There too, the draft of the ministers was fully presented but the summary of the Jan Lokpal was kept
 or apeksha ke anuroop mantrimandal ne mantriyon ke masaude ko apanaakar sansad main pesh karne ke liye sahmati de di
 On 4 August 2011, the Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament
 sarkaar ke lokapal vidheyak main pradhanmantri ko unke kaarykaal ke dauraan iske daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya tha
 But all former Prime Ministers were placed under its purview
 iske anusaar lokapal ek samiti hogi jiske adhyaksh vartmaan yaa sevanivrutt nyaayadhish honge
 It will have eight members, of which four will be law-abiding and experienced people
 isamen jaanch kii samay seemaa saat saal rakhi gai thi
 The 65th Independence Day celebrations of India took place in the shadow of Anna Hazare's announcement of the end of the April fast that if the government did not pass the Lokpal Bill by August 15, they would fast again
 15 agast se kai din purv hi yah spasht ho chukaa tha ki 16 agast se ghoshit anshan jarur hoga
 The government started every effort to stop it
 dilli police ne 1 agast tak jantar mantar par anshan kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare suggested four other places and asked for permission to fast there, but that too was not given
 antat 13 agast ko anna hajaare ne ghoshnaa kii ki yadi unhen anshan kii ijaajat nahin di gai to ve jail baro andolan shuru karenge
 He also announced to abandon water
 dilli police ne jepi park main anshan karne kii anumati 22 pratibandhon ke saath di

 inamen pradarshnakariyon kii sankhya 5000 tak simit rakhane, anshan 3 din tak hi karne, anshan sthal par laudspikar kaa prayog na karne, tent na lagane aadi kii sharten shaamil thim
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of the 65th Independence Day celebrations of India, expressed his desire to end corruption on the one hand, but at the same time termed any demonstration for him as unconstitutional
 anna hajaare sara din rajghat par chintan karte rahe or shaam ko anshan ke jari rakhane kii ghoshnaa kii
 He said, "we will go to JP Park for a fast in the morning
 We have come to know that there is Section 144 there but if we refuse to go there, then we will sit in the same place where we have to go

 The police told the people present there that they were taking Anna to the fast
 unhone jivan anmol aspataal ke paas media or anna samarthakon ko aage badhane se roak diya
 Shortly after being arrested and taken to the Civil Lines Police Mess in Delhi, he started his fast there and refused to take water

 In 1947, the first war between India and Pakistan was also fought for Kashmir

 The infiltrators of Pakistan were quickly identified and instead of rebelling, the public informed the Indian soldiers and the operation completely failed

 On 1 September 1965, Pakistan, under an operation called Grand Slam, attacked the strategic city of Akhnoor, Jammu and Kashmir, from a strategic drift

 Pakistan was in a very good position during this phase of the war and this unexpected attack caused panic in the Indian camp
 akhnur ke pakistani sena ke haath main jane se bharat ke liye kashmir ghati mehar kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa tha
 There were two reasons for the failure of the Grand Slam
 The first and the biggest reason was that Pakistan's military command changed its military commander at the mouth of the victory, in such a way, the Pakistani army was delayed by a day and those 24 In the hour, India got an opportunity to bring additional troops and goods to protect Akhnoor
 Local commanders of the Indian Army themselves were aghast why Pakistan gave up such an easy victory

 General Chaudhary did not agree with this, but the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri ignored the matter and ordered the attack

 The big officers of the Indian Army did not know the ground situation properly, so they ordered the 3 Jats to retreat, fearing that the 3 Jats had also suffered heavy losses, this caused a lot of disappointment to the command officer of the 3 Jats and later on Dograi Then there was a huge cost to capture

 According to Air Commander Sajjad Haider, who led Pakistan's No

 bharatiyon ke anusaar F-86 chote se folland nait ke saamne kamazor tha jiske kaaran in vimaanon ko "saibar naashak" kaha jane laga tha

 Pakistan sources have denied claims of losing only one squadron of the Pakistan Air Force, stating that Pakistan had sought additional aircraft from Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and China within 10 days of the initial war

 In the 1965 war, the largest wars of tanks were fought after World War II
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, bharat fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T
H
 Malik
 At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armored cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armored divisions, the 1st and 6th armored divisions - the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armor, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar 
; They were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armored Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, bharat's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians the reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 apni or duusare kii haani ke bare main bharat or pakistan donon ne bilkul bemail daawey kiye
 The brief table of claims of the two countries is as follows There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; Each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy — on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time United Nations intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on US ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, India had the better of the war
 New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 varg mile of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 varg mile of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 The United States and the Soviet Union used important diplomatic equipment to prevent further escalation in conflict between the two South Asian countries

 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, India budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, India reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 December killing one Pakistani Army captain and on 2 February 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 Due to many strategic mistakes made by both India and Pakistan, this war came to a disastrous situation
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defense of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian Army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 " Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani Air Marshal and Commander in Chief of PAF during the war, Noor Khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; The war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan As such, India agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, India was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war - Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, bharat's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, bharat focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, bharat established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy - India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", SM Burke writes - After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote - The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; This result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during the early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defense spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defense spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government advisory
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, India did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, saanchaa:pakistani sena 1210 is an ordinary year of Gregory calendar

 kisi bhi bhashaa ke ang pratyang kaa vishleshan tathaa vivechan vyakaran kehalaata he
 Grammar is the discipline through which to speak the pure of a language, to read pure and to write pure
 kisi bhi bhashaa ke likhane, padhane or bolne ke nishchit niyam hote hai
 It is necessary to follow these rules to maintain the purity and beauty of the language
 ye niyam bhi vyakaran ke antargat aate hai
 Grammar is an important part of language study
 kisi bhi "bhashaa" ke ang pratyang kaa vishleshan tathaa vivechan "vyakaran" kehalaata he, jaise ki sharir ke ang pratyang kaa vishleshan tathaa vivechan "sharirshastra" or kisi desh pradesh aadi kaa varnan "bhugol"
 That is, the grammar does not rotate a language by its command, it manifests the position tendency of the direct language
 "chalata he" ek kriyaapad he or vyakaran padhe bina bhi sab log ise isi tarah bolte hai; iskaa sahi arth samaj lete hai
 Grammar will analyze this term to show that it has two components - "walks" and "is"
 phir vah in do avyavon kaa bhi vishleshan karke batayega ki "chalata" or "he" ke bhi apane avyav hai
 Two characters are evident in "chal"; But the grammar will make it clear that "ch" has two letters "ch" and "A"
 isi tarah "l" main bhi "l" or "a"
 These letters can no longer be fragments; These are the "letters"
 vyakaran in aksharon kii bhi shrenee banayega, "vyanjan" or "swar"
 "ch" and "L" are consonants and "A" vowels
 chi, chi or li, lee main swar hai "i" or "i", vyanjan "ch" or "l"
 This type of analysis is very useful; It is not a waste business
 yah vishleshan hi "vyakaran" he
 The other name of grammar is also "shabhanushasana"
 vah shabdasambandhi anushaasan karata he - batalaata he ki kisi shabd kaa kis tarah prayog karnaa chahie
 The tendency of words in the language remains its own; Words do not work in the language of grammar
 parantu bhashaa kii pravriti ke anusaar vyakaran shabdaprayog kaa nirdesh karata he
 It does not rule the language, it does its teaching according to its position

 ) sansar main sabase pehle "vyakaran" vidya kaa janm kahaan hua? The linguists of the world have unanimously accepted that the most ancient Vedas in the literature available on this earth

 When a language starts to glow with the richness of literature, then its grammar is needed
 "veda" kaisaa mahatvapurn sahitya he, yah isi se samajha ja saktaa he ki ise itane dinon tak manushya ne gale se lagaakar praanon kii tarah isaki raksha kii he
 It is not a simple task to keep each of his mantras memorized in the form and keep his "sound" safe

 - became grammar
 is prakaar bharat main sabase pehle "vyakaran" vidya kaa janm hua
 Grammar does not stop the movement of language, as stated earlier; And neither does it change with grammar
 kisi desh pradesh kaa bhugol kya vahaan kii gatividhi ko roktaa badalata he? bhashaa to apni gati se chalati he
 Grammar is neither its regulator nor its inhibitor
 haan, sahasron varsh baad jab koi bhashaa kisi duusare rup main aa jaati he, tab vah vyakaran is ke liye anupayogi ho jate he
 Then it will have a separate grammar
 vah purana vyakaran tab bhi bekaar na ho jayega; us puraani bhashaa kaa yatharth parichay detaa rahegaa
 This is not an ordinary utility
 haan, yadi koi kisi bhashaa kaa vyakaran apane agyaan se galat bana de, to vah hi galat hoga
 The language will not follow it and even if it violates the rules of that grammar, the language will not be called wrong
 sanskrit ke ek vaiyaakaran ne "punsu" ke saath "punkshu" pad ko bhi niyambaddh kiya; parantu vah vahiin dharaa rah gaya
 Nobody ever said "punkshu"
 panini ne "vishram" shabd sadhu batalaaya; "shram" kii hi tarah "vishram"
 But "rest" continued in Sanskrit literature; Running and going on
 bhashaa kii pravriti he
 When Panini could not stop the flow of language, then what is the number of others? vyakaran tathaa bhashavigyaan do shabdashastra hai; donon kaa kaaryakshetra bhinn-bhinn he; par ek duusare ke donon sahyogi hai
 Grammar considers mere usage; While linguistics describes the origin of the original form of "verse" as the method of etymology or evolution
 vyakaran yah batalaayegaa ki "na" kaa rup "a" yaa "an" ho jaataa he
 Vyanjanadi words have "A" and Swaradi has "an" - "unique", "unique"
 jab nishedh main pradhanta ho, tab samaas nahin hota - ayan brahmano naasti", "asya upama naasti"
 Elsewhere "abraham: Vedadhyayan Mandadara: Santi" and "anupam Kashmirsundarya Darsham" etc
 will be compounded; Because prohibition is not positive
 vyakaran samaas bataa degaa or kahan samaas thik rahegaa, kahan nahin; yah sab batalaana "sahitya shaastra" kaa kaam he
 The consonant from the "N" becomes "A" and the alphabet becomes "A"
 isi "an" ko saswar karke "an" rup main "samaas" ke liye hindi ne le liya he - "anhoni", "anjaan" aadi
 These diverse forms of "no" do not make grammar; He fills the "narrative" of the created forms
 yah kaam bhashavigyaan kaa he ki vah "na" ke in roopon par prakaash daale
 The grammar will show that by adding the suffix "no" to a metal, adding the Hindi noun "aa" to it becomes expressive nouns - coming, going, getting up, sitting, etc
 parantu vyakaran kaa kaam yah nahin he ki aa, ja, uth, baith aadi dhaatuon kii vikasapaddati samajhaae
 This work is of linguistics
 sanskrit main aisi sangyaayen napunsak varg main prayukt hoti hai - aagamanam, gamnam, utthanam, upaveshnam aadi
 But in Hindi there is a pamprayoga- "when did you come?" The grammar will not tell why Hindi has used
 vah anvakhyaan bhar karegaa -"aisi sangyaayen punwargeey rup rakhti he" bas! yah bataanaa bhashavigyaan kaa kaam he ki aisa kyon hua! When a language takes a word from another language, it rules it out - governs its speed according to its grammar
 hindi kaa "dhoti" shabd angreji main gaya, to vahaan ise angreji vyakaran ko shirodharya karnaa padaa
 It is used in English - "brining our dhoties"
 vahaan "dhoti" kaa bahuvachan "dhotiyaan" na chalegaa
 The "bring Our Dhots" experiment will be misunderstood there
 isi tarah angreji kaa "foot" shabd hindi ne liya or apane shashan main rakhaa
 The plural of "foot" in English is "feet"; But English grammar will not work in Hindi
 prayog hota he - "chaar foot oonchaai", "chaar feet oonchaai" galat he
 "height" is also incorrect; "height" is pure
 "nichaai unchaai" hota he; "nichai oonchaai" nahin
 In Sanskrit, the dialects of unambiguous words become interchangeable - "poet samagatau"; This will not happen in Hindi
 "do kavi aae" kaha jayega
 Similarly "sanskriti samagatau" in Sanskrit
 hindi main "rajdampati" sarvatra
 It is also a process of assimilating testamentary words to cut the mismatched form and make it into your mail
 hindi kaa "ganga ji" shabd angreji main gaya; par "genzis" banaakar
 English took the word "lantern" from Hindi; But by making "lantern" and "hospital" by "hospital"
 "hospital" bhi hindi main galat he
 Forms like "hospital" and "doctor" are not acceptable to Hindi
 hindi kaa vyakaran niyaman karegaa ki hindi main vah uccharan he hi nahin, jise swar par ulta top rakh kar prakat kiya jaataa he
