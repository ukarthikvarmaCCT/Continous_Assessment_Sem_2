00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,912
"Going from the world is free."

8
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:11,136
"Look at this charade of the world."

9
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,248
"Absolutely free! Absolutely free!"

10
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:19,238

"The world's A B C D!"

14
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:27,418
"Tolerating
thousands of difficulties."

15
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:29,477
"To rise up from a plant to a tree."

16
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:35,098
"Darling, don't leave me!"

17
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:37,171
"Don't break my heart!"

18
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:39,245
"Darling, don't leave me!"

19
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:41,088
"Don't break my heart!"

20
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:45,158
"You are under the oath of my oath."

21
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:49,190
"You are under the oath of my oath."

22
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:51,283
"Say you want to know."

23
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:53,952
"I am beat and here we go."

24
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:55,411
"Mamma, you like move."

25
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:57,331
"Move, come on."

00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,904
"One, two, three! One, two, three!"

27
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:01,901
"Coming into the world is free!"

"Free! Free!"

"Your youth is the most
talked about everywhere."

00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:19,795
"Your youth is the most
talked about everywhere."

47
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:23,846

"Look at this charade of the world."

"Absolutely free! Absolutely free!"

56
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:49,138
"Free."

57
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,259
"One, two, three! One, two, three!"

"The world's A B C D!"

61
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,438
"Tolerating thousands of difficulties."

62
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:04,435
"To rise up from a plant to a tree."

63
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,928
"Let's take out the one, two, and three."

64
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:20,563
'This country! Our country!
The rising country!'

65
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,362
'The leader of our rising country!'

66
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:30,163
'This is a business man.'

67
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:32,429
'And this is the business of a man.'

68
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:38,189
'And this is the rising don!
Laxminarayan! No. 1!'

69
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:47,827
Who is Mumbai's king?

70
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:50,899
'I mean, he is a brother son!'

71
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,664
Brother son, what's that, brother!

72
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:55,930
Just like there is star son!

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,312
Just like that, there is Brother son.

74
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,770
Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol, Hrithik Roshan..

75
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,344
..Sanjay Dutt, Abhishek Bachchan.

76
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:03,840
You are the
Abhishek Bachchan of hooliganism.

77
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:06,797
Your father, Pappu MMS.

78
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:09,101
Was the Amitabh Bachchan of hooliganism!

79
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:11,904
'And today his refugee is being released.'

80
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:14,323
'That means his first murder, killing.'

81
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:17,395
I have to kill you.

82
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:18,547
What have I done?

83
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:20,237
You dare seize brother Batlya's land.

84
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:21,926
Why you..
- No! No!

85
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:23,078
Kill him, brother.

86
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,307
Kill him Laxmi!
- Kill him, brother.

87
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:28,224
'But will his first
killing be hit or a flop.'

88
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,106
Who are you?

89
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,560
Aslam Phoda! Chikne! Tell her.

90
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:35,904
Who is Mumbai's king?

91
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:39,590
Who is it? - Brother, right now
she seems to be king and King Kong.

92
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:40,704
Hit them.

93
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,698
'Poor Laxminarayan.'

94
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,501
'Brother Batlya tried to
explain Laxminarayan's mother a lot.'

95
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,806
What did he explain?

96
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:52,070
'Laxmi's mother!
Bullet fired from the gun..

97
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:54,758
..and the child that's
once born cannot go back.'

98
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:57,946
'But only a mother knows her pain.'

99
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,669
I thought you will commit 2-4 murders.

100
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,512
'Settle down in life.'

101
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:07,507
I will get you married to
Chhota Khujli's daughter..

102
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:12,346
..Meena Khujli, but you
turned out to be useless.

103
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:15,072
Slowly mother!

104
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:17,314
Laxmi's mother!
Laxmi's mother! Laxmi..

105
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:18,758
Kanta!

106
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:21,562
Go and do all this at your home.

107
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,288
Brother! Brother,
give me another chance.

108
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:25,517
Dear..

109
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,051
..you never get to hit two
fours on the same ball..

110
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:29,664
..and you never get a second
chance in the same lifetime.

111
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:32,467
Laxminarayan, there can't
be another foot like you..

112
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,042
..in the entire world.

113
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:40,915
"I am helpless and useless."

114
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,451
Wow!

115
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,603
"Helpless.."

116
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,830
'It means hopeless.'

117
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:58,464
This..

118
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,216
Biting! Biting!
- What?

119
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,520
The shoe is biting me.
- Then you bite the shoe.

120
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:22,694
Hey! Hey! Hey listen, thief!

121
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:26,227
'This is Laxminarayan No.2!
MBA from Jharkhand university.'

122
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:27,725
'He has only two rules in his life.'

123
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:30,566
'Rule no. 1, the boss is always right.'

124
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:32,563
'Rule no. 2, if the boss is wrong..

125
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,792
..then follow rule number 1.'

126
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:37,056
Mr. Laxminarayan!
- Yes sir.

127
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,667
I think we need to have a little talk.
- Yes sir. - Sit.

128
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,085
On the sofa or the chair, sir?

129
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:46,848
Chair!
- Left or right sir? - Left!

130
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:48,538
Your left or my left, sir?

131
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:49,882
My left!

132
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,378
This left or the extreme left sir?

133
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:53,837
Get out of this door!

134
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:55,142
Now just leave, you idiot! Idiot!

135
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,448
Sir, I came in through that door.

136
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,445
There are two doors! Shall
I go from here or there?

137
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:03,322
Just get out! Get out, you idiot!
Get out of my office now! - Okay.

138
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:04,934
"It's a secret matter."

139
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,163
"May we be together!"

140
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,467
"Wear my inner wears,
whether it is day or night."

141
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,386
Come, come.

142
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:12,806
Take it, sister, take whatever you want.

143
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:14,150
Take a look.

144
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,571
God knows where they
come from to sell underwear.

145
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:17,645
Brother, buy an underwear.
- I don't want it.

146
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:20,525
They are very nice underwear, buy it.

147
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:22,138
I don't want it.

148
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:24,902
Buy it! If you wear it yourself,
you will turn into Superman.

149
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,106
It won't tear if you fly wearing it.

150
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,550
If you fight with someone
wearing it, it won't tear.

151
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:30,586
If you climb the Qutub Minar
wearing it, it won't tear.

152
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:32,621
If you jump from the Qutub
Minar wearing it, it won't tear.

153
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,040
Everything you wear will tear,
but not the underwear.

154
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:36,653
That's Laxminarayan's guarantee.

155
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,264
My head will surely explode
because of your blabbering.

156
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:40,416
Shall I give it to you in writing?

157
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:41,875
I told you, I have underwear.

158
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,064
If you do, then why don't you wear it?

159
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:47,290
How do you know I
haven't worn underwear?

160
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:48,480
You know my nature.

161
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,398
'And this is Laxminarayan No. 3!
And he says.'

162
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,278
I can tell you what's written in
the letter seeing the envelope.

163
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,890
I can tell the son's
size by looking at the papa.

164
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,042
How nice.

165
00:08:58,118 --> 00:08:59,654
'He has been selling underwear and vests..

166
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:00,922
..since he didn't even wear underwear.'

167
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:02,726
'By selling underwear and vests..

168
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,570
..he has started a garment factory.'

169
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:06,566
'Bulbul Lingerie's.'

170
00:09:07,642 --> 00:09:08,717
This is the first and..

171
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:11,904
Ballu, what's going on?
- Dad. Who are they?

172
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,978
Dad, they are our brand's models.

173
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,130
And right now, we are
having a photo session.

174
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:16,704
Are they models, or just cluster of bones?

175
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:20,006
It seems as if they have
fallen ill wearing our lingerie!

176
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,773
Then who will buy our product?

177
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:23,386
We will have to wear all of them.

178
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,498
And the underwear is okay,
you and I can wear it.

179
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,418
Who will wear that? Your father?

180
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:29,107
Dad, please don't say underwear,

181
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,950
Say lingerie for God sake.
- Keep quiet.

182
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:32,141
You fool.

183
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:33,562
What's all this going on?

184
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,325
'Uncle Shakespeare had said,
what's in the name.'

185
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:41,395
'But uncle forgot, what if
when three names are similar?'

186
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:43,661
'Laxminarayan 1!'

187
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:45,158
Laxminarayan 2!

188
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:46,464
Laxminarayan 3!

189
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,613
"One, two, three!"

190
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:52,262
Hiralal!
- Yes.

191
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:54,106
The diamond is worth 20 crores..

192
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:56,602
..and the entire journey is by road.
- Yes.

193
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,442
Go comfortably, and
bring the diamond. - Yes.

194
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,899
Take this 2 rupee note.

195
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:07,046
Son. You will get that
diamond worth 20 crores..

196
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,027
..only when you will give him
this half torn 2 rupee note.

197
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:15,302
I swear what an idea.

198
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:16,454
Really nice!

199
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:19,066
Brother, don't be tensed.

200
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:20,218
I am there.

201
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:24,250
Now I will bring that
diamond from that Pondi!

202
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:25,402
Challenge.

203
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:55,085
"Don't ever stop!"

204
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,120
"You got to rock."

205
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:04,685
"Since I saw you, I was amazed."

206
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:09,062
"Your eyes wounded me."

207
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,672
"Your intoxication immersed in my veins."

208
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:16,704
"Your beauty mesmerised me."

209
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,662
"You got to rock, darling."

210
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:20,774
"Don't ever stop, darling."

211
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,963
"You got to rock, darling."

212
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,768
"My beloved."

213
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:29,568
"My heart fell for you
that's not a mistake."

214
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,291
"Stay in my arm that's my only desire."

215
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:37,709
"I said to the Lord, my darling."

216
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:42,125
"I thank you."

217
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:46,080
"My heart is in pain."

218
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:50,304
"Now you decide my fate."

219
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:52,301
"You got to rock, darling."

220
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,221
"Don't ever stop, darling."

221
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,602
"You got to rock, darling."

222
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:59,098
"My beloved."

223
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:11,523
"All I ever talk about is you."

224
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:16,032
"Your fragrance lights up my world."

225
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,179
"My life belongs only to you."

226
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:24,442
"Only your image is immersed in my eyes."

227
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:28,013
"Whichever path now you will walk on."

228
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,870
"My destination lies there."

229
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:38,458
"Come my darling,
my craziness is telling me."

230
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:40,474
"I am now your lover."

231
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,870
"Darling! My heart says!"

232
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:49,517
"Come and listen to the saga of my heart."

233
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:53,126
"Darling, you are my companion!"

234
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:55,238
"Your intoxication is growing."

235
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:58,810
"Don't make me restless anymore.
No! No! No!"

236
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:01,536
"Your gait is the best."

237
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:05,568
"Do me a favour, accept me."

238
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:07,565
"You got to rock, darling."

239
00:13:07,642 --> 00:13:09,638
"Don't ever stop, darling."

240
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:11,750
"You got to rock, darling."

241
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,536
"My beloved."

242
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:15,898
"You got to rock, darling."

243
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:17,971
"Don't ever stop, darling."

244
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,390
"You got to rock, darling."

245
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,214
"My beloved."

246
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,269
"You got to rock, darling."

247
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,400
"Don't ever stop, darling."

248
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:28,493
"You got to rock, darling."

249
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,298
"My beloved."

250
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,813
"You got to rock, darling."

251
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:34,752
"Don't ever stop, darling."

252
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,325
"You got to rock, darling."

253
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:38,630
"My beloved."

254
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,088
"My beloved."

255
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,003
Hira stop!

256
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,190
Stop Hira! I know you have the diamond.

257
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:50,534
We are very dangerous people.

258
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:51,763
He isn't listening to us.

259
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,414
He is still running, idiot.

260
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:55,872
Kill him.

261
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,330
Don't touch me!

262
00:13:58,406 --> 00:13:59,750
You don't love me anymore, isn't it?

263
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:00,979
I love you my bubblaboo!

264
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:02,515
How romantic.

265
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,282
Say, Chandu loves Chandni.

266
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:05,626
Chandu loves Chandni.

267
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:06,778
It sounds so nice.

268
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:07,930
Keep saying it.

269
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:10,387
Are you mad?
I mean, let me show it too sweet heart.

270
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:11,885
Let me show it too.

271
00:14:14,842 --> 00:14:16,416
I didn't do anything.

272
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:18,682
Chandu, there is someone.. at the window.

273
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:22,061
There is no one. Come baby, come.

274
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:26,976
What happened?

275
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:30,317
See! Really! Chandu, there
really is someone there.

276
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:32,006
There is nobody there.
- There is someone.

277
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,464
What is it?

278
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,499
Why are you peeking in the
car and scaring my girlfriend?

279
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,072
Brother, I am not scaring her?

280
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,147
Take a look at my back?

281
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:41,376
Why should I look at your back? Get lost.

282
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:43,987
Brother, for Gods sake,
take a look at my back.

283
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:45,907
I am not like that.
- I am not like that too.

284
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:48,019
Brother. Please, take a look at my back.

285
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,670
Help me! I have been shot in the back!

286
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:50,938
Take a look at my back!

287
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:52,512
Oh yes!

288
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,315
O my God, come on.

289
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,634
Run! Run!
- Come on, quickly.

290
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:58,771
Start it!
- Come on, run quickly.

291
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:00,538
Brother please this bottle..
- This bottle.

292
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:01,728
Batlya!
- Chandu!

293
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:04,301
9820.. 123.
- Leave me!

294
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,413
Albert, they are running away.

295
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,755
Albert, you deal with him.
I will stop the car.

296
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,096
Girl and boy, stop the car.
- Chandu.

297
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:13,978
I will count till three.

298
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:15,552
1..
- Faster.

299
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,856
2.. stop, 3!

300
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,661
You cannot die!

301
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:20,966
Shall I shoot you?

302
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,693
The boy and girl ran away, sad travelling.

303
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:24,998
Pinto, this Hira is dead.

304
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:26,880
And that diamond.

305
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,299
Fake diamond.

306
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:30,797
Take it out.

307
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,680
I hate tooth aches.

308
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:44,928
Tooth.. one!
- And people, two.

309
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:48,499
Papa will be happily shocked to see it.

310
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:49,882
Yes!

311
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:54,106
This is the 20 crore diamond.

312
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:56,909
"Everybody say dance."

313
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:58,982
"Everybody say dance."

314
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:05,626
Do you know why I call myself papa?

315
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,162
Why papa?

316
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:10,387
Because D'mello's Yadav,
only knows how to get.

317
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:11,808
Pa.. pa!

318
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:12,960
Papa!

319
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:15,494
"You idiots."

320
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,182
Papa!

321
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:21,869
And you left the 20 crore worth diamond,
right there.

322
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:24,902
"You idiots."

323
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,549
No papa, no. Not the current, papa.

324
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:30,778
"You idiots."

325
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:31,891
"Everybody say dance."

326
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:33,619
Pinto.
- Yes papa.

327
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:36,192
You know, we get electricity
only for 2 hours in the entire day.

328
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:37,728
Shortage, papa, shortage.

329
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,302
And that too, you make me waste.

330
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:40,454
Yes papa.

331
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,758
Tell me, where is the diamond.

332
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,294
No!
- Tell me.

333
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:50,054
Gods!

334
00:16:50,131 --> 00:16:53,856
Like every time, there is a
power failure this time too, papa.

335
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:55,738
Now, it will return only tomorrow, papa.

336
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:07,872
Shabbo!
- Papa!

337
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:09,946
When there is a power failure,
where does it go?

338
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:11,328
In the invertors, papa.

339
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:15,283
Then switch on the invertors.
- Okay, papa.

340
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,435
"You idiots."

341
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,854
Is this a joke?

342
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:20,698
We are somebody's children too.

343
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,733
We forget things too, papa.

344
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,997
You have invented these bombs, isn't it?

345
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,917
Yes papa, I have made it.

346
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:31,142
I have a crash course diploma papa,
in making bombs.

347
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:34,790
Now this bomb will kill you both.

348
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:41,088
Papa, may you never have a power failure!

349
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:42,854
One's..
- No Papa!

350
00:17:43,238 --> 00:17:44,736
Two's!
- No Pinto!

351
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,118
Tell me where is the diamond?

352
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,846
But I don't know anything, Papa!

353
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:48,960
"You idiots."

354
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:52,877
"You came to search me."
- And three!

355
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:54,106
No.

356
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:57,062
Papa, it didn't explode.

357
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:00,518
Why doesn't it explode?

358
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,590
Papa, you have planted the bomb here..

359
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:04,973
..and operating the remote from there.

360
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,125
How can it explode?

361
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:07,661
Come in the range.

362
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:10,886
Should I sit on the
bomb and press the button?

363
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:13,190
What kind of a bomb have you made?

364
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,379
Why doesn't it explode?

365
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,299
Papa, don't hit me.

366
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:18,989
Don't doubt the inventor.

367
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,062
I can't make a mistake in making the bomb.

368
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:22,253
I have done a crash course diploma.

369
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:23,981
Show me the remote.

370
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:25,670
Here.

371
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:31,200
See this. - Papa, you have
placed the battery wrongly.

372
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,888
Oh!
- Now you say oh! Interchange it.

373
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,307
And now see how it explodes.

374
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:37,459
See.

375
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,030
That's all.

376
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:43,027
It was simple, isn't it papa?

377
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:46,829
At least now tell me where is the diamond.

378
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:49,632
Chandni, look at this diamond.

379
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,437
Our fate will shine like this too.

380
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,587
Now I won't have to do this sales job.

381
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:56,160
We won't have to live in
this car showroom's washroom.

382
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:58,387
We won't have to listen to Laila madam.

383
00:18:58,733 --> 00:18:59,808
Let's run away.

384
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:01,306
You idiot, they must be looking for us.

385
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:03,379
The situation will calm down,
then we will..

386
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:05,645
Till then, we will have to
keep this diamond in a place..

387
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,258
..where no one can see it.

388
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:10,522
I have an idea.

389
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:11,582
What?

390
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:14,746
Why did you put it in the petrol tank?

391
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:17,664
Look, no one will be able to see it here!

392
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,661
Even I can't see it.
- This car is for sale.

393
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:20,813
What if someone comes to buy it?

394
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,155
No one has come to buy
it for the last 7 months..

395
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,307
..why will anyone come now?

396
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:30,528
The death of a man, and
the mistress of a woman..

397
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,101
..you can never save
yourself from them.

398
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:36,672
And Yadav's death has been decided.

399
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,130
Kill him!

400
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:40,819
Whom should we send, brother?

401
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:44,544
After Hira's murder, the police
has become very alert in Pondi.

402
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,232
Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother!

403
00:19:47,962 --> 00:19:49,152
Greetings, brother!

404
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,494
Greet him!
- Greetings.

405
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:55,104
I have heard, there is a
shooter's post vacant with you.

406
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,330
Give my son one
chance to commit a murder.

407
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,053
As long as I am alive,
he makes his career.

408
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:05,126
Gets settled.

409
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:07,930
Give my Laxmi this contract.

410
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,197
Give him please.

411
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:12,422
Yes brother, I will put in all my
effort for committing this murder.

412
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,150
There is no chance that I will fail.

413
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,067
And if he fails this time,
then he is a big fool. I tell you.

414
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:29,157
A bloomed rose and a stomach upset..

415
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:31,200
..doesn't stay forever!
- Yes brother.

416
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:34,963
This time I am completely sure..

417
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:36,730
..that Laxminarayan will
surely commit this murder.

418
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,458
Thank you, brother.

419
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:41,222
Brother, I will always be
indebted to you. - That's enough.

420
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:43,488
Keep this. It is imported.

421
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:45,523
It will fire so stealthily..

422
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,981
..even you won't know that
the bullet has been fired.

423
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:49,670
But brother, whom do I have to kill?

424
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:52,896
Poets have fans, and walls have ears.

425
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:55,392
Go to Pondi!

426
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,504
Your room will be booked
in hotel Blue Diamond.

427
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,424
You will find an envelope in the room.

428
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:01,920
The person whose photo
will be in the envelope..

429
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:03,264
..you will have to kill him.

430
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:04,723
Brother.. brother..
- Just a minute.

431
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:07,757
First you will have to
take my diamond back from him.

432
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:10,176
I want that diamond back at any cost.

433
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,597
Don't worry, brother.

434
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:13,210
Take some marijuana and go to sleep.
- Very good.

435
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:14,746
Now I will directly hit the target.

436
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,430
Laxminarayan! This is the
first time I have heard this name.

437
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:22,387
Papa, this is a very inauspicious time.

438
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:23,578
Let us flee to the village.

439
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:24,998
We are in the village.

440
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:28,685
Papa. Let us go in the city,
the car is ready. - Idiots.

441
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,832
I will give him a torturous death.

442
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:34,483
Pinto.
- Papa!

443
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,171
Make such a bomb that will explode.

444
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,742
Laxminarayan will come,
but he won't go back alive.

445
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:46,003
Hello sir! Morning sir!

446
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,805
Laxmi, you idiot, you stupid, you fool!

447
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:51,763
Listen to me carefully!
- Yes.

448
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,259
I have seen an old car on the net.

449
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:56,333
Car, wow sir! How is it sir?

450
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,677
I want to buy this car!

451
00:21:58,214 --> 00:21:59,558
Go to Pondi right now.

452
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:03,091
Check the car and give
them 1 lakh rupees advance.

453
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:04,742
Alright, you understood that?
- Right, sir.

454
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:06,778
I will mail you the other details.

455
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:07,891
Please check your e-mail.

456
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:11,040
Which mail sir, g-mail,
yahoo mail, hotmail, rediff mail.

457
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:13,152
Or the new mail these days sir, zapak mail.

458
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,266
It delivers quickly, sir.

459
00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:15,418
Idiot.

460
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:17,606
I will fax you through the computer..

461
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,795
..switch on the fax machine.
- Yes sir.

462
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,867
Sir, there are two fax machines.

463
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:24,288
Which one should I switch on?

464
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,426
The left or the right.

465
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:27,782
Left one!
- Your left or mine.

466
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:30,739
My left!
- Which position are you in sir?

467
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,968
I cannot see it on the phone.

468
00:22:32,045 --> 00:22:33,466
Because if you are sitting in front of me..

469
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:34,848
..then your left is my right.

470
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,922
And my right will be your left, sir.

471
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:38,688
And if you are sitting besides me..

472
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:40,992
..then your left is my left
and your right is my right.

473
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,605
Laxmi!
- Because sir..

474
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,109
This is the last chance for you.

475
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:47,827
If you don't do this right,
then I will fire you!

476
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:49,018
Understood!

477
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,090
I understood, sir.
Go to Pondi right now.

478
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,816
And stay in hotel Blue Diamond.

479
00:22:54,893 --> 00:22:56,083
Blue Diamond! The room will be booked.

480
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:59,539
Okay I will send all the details there.
Understood?

481
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:00,730
Okay sir.

482
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,533
Remember, I want this car at any cost.

483
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:05,491
I want to gift it to my wife.

484
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:07,066
Which wife, sir?

485
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:08,640
The one in Worli or the one in Bandra?

486
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:12,902
You idiot! I will.. in you!

487
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:16,128
You fool..

488
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,256
Yes sir.

489
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:20,506
Why is the boss always so angry?

490
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:22,310
What are you doing madam?

491
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:24,000
What are you doing madam?

492
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,648
When Laila buys a car to sell,
she checks it properly!

493
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,326
Madam, my car.

494
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:38,861
I cannot sell your car.

495
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:41,280
Not just you, no one
can sell my car now.

496
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,466
You are Laila!
- Yes.

497
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,808
You see, we are from ICUC bank.

498
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:51,802
You had taken a loan of
25 lakh from our bank?

499
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:53,952
Yes!

500
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,219
And you haven't paid a single installment..

501
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:56,909
..for the past 10 months.

502
00:23:57,485 --> 00:24:00,403
Actually I..
- No problem, ma'am.

503
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,861
We are always at your disposal,
at your service.

504
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:05,203
Actually, we had come
to give you a notice.

505
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:06,355
What notice?

506
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,659
If you don't deposit all your
installments within 5 days..

507
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:10,502
..then we will seize all of your cars.

508
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,384
What? You cannot do that.

509
00:24:12,461 --> 00:24:14,150
We can do that madam, because..

510
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:16,262
..we are idiots and fools.

511
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:17,645
I will call the police.

512
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:18,859
We are the police.

513
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:21,178
We work part time with
the bank for recovery.

514
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:23,750
Okay madam, have a good day.

515
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:25,747
If you are satisfied with
our services tell others..

516
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:28,358
..if not, tell us. Take care. Come on.

517
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:31,776
Yes sister, what do you want?

518
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:34,118
Give me a size 40 bra in this material.

519
00:24:34,195 --> 00:24:35,578
40! Fine. My dear beloved..

520
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:37,536
This one looks good too, isn't it?
- Yes, I like it.

521
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:39,456
Yes!
- Hey dad, what's up?

522
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,762
What are you doing?

523
00:24:40,992 --> 00:24:42,451
I am taking sister's bra out.

524
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,254
Don't say bra, panty and all, please.

525
00:24:45,523 --> 00:24:46,867
Shut up, you fool.

526
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:48,826
What else will I call it as? A pajama?

527
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:52,550
I have been selling it since
you didn't even start wearing it.

528
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,200
Here sister, 42, it will be a perfect fit.

529
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:59,539
Listen to me..
- Brother, not 42, give me 40.

530
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:01,997
42 will be a perfect fit.

531
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:05,376
I told you I don't
want 42, give me 40.

532
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:07,680
What are you talking? How do you know?

533
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:11,136
Surprising! It is my size,
who else will know about it?

534
00:25:11,328 --> 00:25:12,749
Seeing the blouse I can
tell the size of the bra..

535
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:14,093
..and seeing the pant..

536
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,590
..I can tell you the size
of the underwear. - Oh God.

537
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,203
You know my nature.
- Yes.

538
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:19,162
Yes, absolutely right.

539
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:22,118
Her husband asks me about her size.

540
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:23,616
Fine brother.

541
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:25,882
Come on, that will be 150.
- Here.

542
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:28,207
Yes, tell me.

543
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,760
At least give me a bag, brother.

544
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:30,950
What will you do with a bag..

545
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,563
..you have to go home and wear it..

546
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,715
Fine brother, fine. Tell me.

547
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,058
You have to leave everything,
and urgently go to Pondi.

548
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,862
You have to meet the designer..

549
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,629
..who has created our
new valentine collection.

550
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:42,278
Actually, I have seen the
designs on the net. Yes.

551
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:44,467
You just have to go and make
an agreement with the girl.

552
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,925
I will go to Pondi, you don't worry.

553
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:48,461
You relax in Singapore, fine.

554
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:50,765
If you like the designs,
then give her 1 lakh rupees.

555
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,070
She will need it.
- Okay.

556
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:53,075
What is her name?

557
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:55,757
Billu Batra!
- Not yours.

558
00:25:55,872 --> 00:25:57,024
Leave that bra! Leave that bra!

559
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:57,984
Get lost!

560
00:25:58,704 --> 00:25:59,482
Yes, tell me.

561
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,941
Please pen some things down.

562
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:02,899
This pen doesn't even work.

563
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:06,624
Let it be dad. Just reach Pondi
and go to hotel Blue Diamond..

564
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:09,504
..I will courier you the
pictures and all the details. Ok.

565
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,808
Please papa. Please don't
say bra and panty there.

566
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:13,560
Keep quiet, you fool.

567
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,030
Let me take a look at her design.

568
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,102
I am a designer.

569
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:24,672
And my brand Pure
Diamonds will be famous soon.

570
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:27,168
The entire world will
wear my undergarments!

571
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:28,435
Wow!

572
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:32,890
Neither less nor more! Bubblegum!

573
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,461
Oh God, this man eats my
brains and gives me a headache.

574
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:38,381
He doesn't have brains at all.

575
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:39,379
I don't understand what should I do now?

576
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:41,261
Please leave from here.

577
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:43,450
It's simple Ms. Jia.

578
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:45,293
Either you leave or throw me out.

579
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,942
Actually, your first
papa and my second papa..

580
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:49,133
..were partners in this restaurant.

581
00:26:49,402 --> 00:26:51,014
So either you buy this restaurant from us..

582
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:52,205
..or sell it to us.

583
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:55,277
You know I don't have
the money to buy it.

584
00:26:55,392 --> 00:26:57,005
Why don't you take half?

585
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:58,810
Happiness, sorrows and bubblegum!

586
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:00,461
These are the things
M.M. Munde never takes in half.

587
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:01,651
The entire world knows that.

588
00:27:01,728 --> 00:27:03,802
I will pay your money gradually.

589
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:05,530
How gradually, Ms. Jia.

590
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:07,872
Tomorrow my client is coming to meet me.

591
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,946
They will surely like my designs.

592
00:27:10,022 --> 00:27:12,442
And then Jia's doors of
destiny will finally open.

593
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:15,168
Come at 12 o'clock and take your money.

594
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:16,550
Okay! Okay Ms. Jai!

595
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:18,893
Tomorrow whether you lose or I will.

596
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:20,198
For now, I am, leaving.

597
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:23,885
"I cannot live without you."

598
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,109
O God, Jia is not a fraud!

599
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:31,450
Laxminarayan should like my designs.

600
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:34,790
Laxmi!
- Mother.

601
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:35,942
Here is your ticket.

602
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:40,435
And listen son,
commit the murder nicely.

603
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,549
Now, you leave mother.

604
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:45,888
And remember, don't eat
anything anyone gives you.

605
00:27:46,118 --> 00:27:49,344
These criminals mix some
intoxication in the food..

606
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:50,803
..and give you to eat.
- Really.

607
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,453
And then they steal your luggage.
- Yes mother.

608
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,525
Remember, don't tell
your name to anyone.

609
00:27:56,602 --> 00:28:01,555
And yes.
- This is 25,000!

610
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:04,090
It will be useful to you in a foreign land.

611
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:06,547
Mother, that's enough. Don't cry!

612
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:09,619
Have you taken the gun?
- Yes mother.

613
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:11,040
Have you loaded the bullets?

614
00:28:11,117 --> 00:28:13,536
Yes mother.
- Take care of yourself.

615
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,299
My son is going to commit a
murder for the first time.

616
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:19,296
Mother, you don't worry.
Please stop crying.

617
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,136
Nothing is better than a gun, and
don't regret if you lose it. Toys.

618
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:26,822
Sorry! I am buying it for the child.

619
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,894
I don't have 1 lakh rupees in my bag.

620
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:33,696
Oh! Wife children..
- Excuse me, sir.

621
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:35,002
Which bus goes to Pondi?

622
00:28:35,078 --> 00:28:38,726
The one behind you! Wife children..
- Excuse me, sir.

623
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:40,646
The left one or the right one sir?

624
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:43,258
The one that just left, that one.
- Oh, God.

625
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:45,408
Stop! Hello! Hello

626
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:46,694
Hello!!

627
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:50,150
No one is listening. Hello!

628
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:55,046
"One, two, three! One, two, three!"

629
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:57,005
"Coming into the world is free!"

630
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:59,366
"Going from the world is free."

631
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:01,690
"Look at this charade of the world."

632
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:03,936
"Absolutely free! Absolutely free!"

633
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,760
Brother, what are you looking at?

634
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,718
This is Pahadganj's good.
- What?

635
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:10,022
This is Pahadganj's good.

636
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,827
This is Karolbaug's piece.

637
00:29:11,904 --> 00:29:12,979
This can't be Karolbaug's piece.

638
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:14,938
This is Pahadganj's piece,
this is Khurana's goods!

639
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,856
She doesn't belong to Khurana,
she is my wife.

640
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,429
I am not talking about your wife..

641
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:23,386
..I am talking about your
wife's bra, this is Khurana's goods.

642
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,998
Khurana sells such goods.

643
00:29:25,075 --> 00:29:27,878
"Coming into the world is free!"

644
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:30,048
"Going from the world is free."

645
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:32,102
"Look at this charade of the world."

646
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:34,522
"Absolutely free! Absolutely free!"

647
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,211
Absolutely.

648
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:38,938
"One, two, three! One, two, three!"

649
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:41,050
"One, two, three!
And One, two, three!"

650
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,277
"Me and you! You and me!"

651
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:45,312
"The world's A B C D!"

652
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:48,768
Have we reached?

653
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:51,955
Why is there police up ahead?

654
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:54,542
My name is Mayawati Chowtala!

655
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:55,718
Come on, all of you open your luggage.

656
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,254
Come on, all of you.

657
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:01,747
Uncle. Open your bag.

658
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:03,706
Take a look! There isn't anything wrong!

659
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:05,165
And you know my nature.

660
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,738
Why? Are you my husband?

661
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:11,309
Your nature depends on my future.

662
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:13,920
This.. what is this?
- There is this one too.

663
00:30:13,997 --> 00:30:15,840
What is all this?
- All of this belongs to me.

664
00:30:16,262 --> 00:30:17,376
Do you wear all this?

665
00:30:17,453 --> 00:30:18,835
No, I sell it.

666
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:20,870
I had come here for
business so I brought is along.

667
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:22,176
I thought if I sell some pieces..

668
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,096
..then it would be enough
for my bus fare too. Okay.

669
00:30:24,595 --> 00:30:26,131
Get out of here!
- Fine, I will set it up there..

670
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:29,318
Come. "Wear my inner wears,
whether it is day or night."

671
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,893
He has set up a shop.

672
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:43,757
Sorry.

673
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:45,869
It's okay.

674
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:48,979
Come. Madam, it's a wonderful piece.

675
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,131
It will fit perfectly.

676
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,512
Yes, you come, Mr. Chavanprash.

677
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:54,010
No ma'am, you have got it wrong.

678
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,546
I am not Mr. Chavanprash.

679
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:57,427
I am Mr. Laxminarayan, ma'am.

680
00:30:57,504 --> 00:30:58,579
Come on, open your bag.

681
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:02,112
Which one ma'am,
the left one or the right one?

682
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:03,648
The left one, come on.

683
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:05,184
Ma'am, your left or mine.

684
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:06,720
Were you born in a military family..

685
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:08,218
..that you are doing left right?

686
00:31:08,294 --> 00:31:09,485
Come on, show me that one.

687
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:12,211
Open the zip.

688
00:31:12,518 --> 00:31:14,208
Ma'am, there are two zips.

689
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:16,589
Should I open the one in the
front or the one in the back?

690
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,894
Tek Chand.
- Yes madam.

691
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:19,046
Take him away.

692
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,350
Open all his zips and search him.

693
00:31:21,427 --> 00:31:24,883
And where you don't find a zip,
tear it, put a zip there..

694
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,150
..then open it and search it!

695
00:31:26,227 --> 00:31:27,379
Madam, you are getting me wrong ma'am.

696
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:28,992
Listen to me ma'am.
- Take him away. - Come to the side.

697
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:30,758
Sir which side, this side or that side?

698
00:31:30,835 --> 00:31:31,910
Come straight with me.
- Okay.

699
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,445
Come.

700
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,133
All the goods are sold, this
is the last one remaining.

701
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,246
For you.

702
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:41,088
Where is Ganda Nala?

703
00:31:41,472 --> 00:31:43,776
Why uncle, do you want to clean it?

704
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:45,965
No. There is the hotel
Blue Diamond besides it.

705
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:47,155
I have to go there.

706
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,302
Can you see that buffalo, straight.
- Yes.

707
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:52,723
Follow him.

708
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,720
He bathes everyday in Ganda Nala.

709
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:56,587
Go.
- Fine. Hey stop..

710
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:01,210
See. If you can see, left
is left and right is right.

711
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:02,707
Then what happens basically..

712
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:05,088
..is that, left for you is right for me..

713
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:07,277
..and left for you is not..
- Forgive me, Lord.

714
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,848
Madam, you are
unnecessarily wasting my time.

715
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:12,346
There is nothing in my bag.

716
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:15,341
That I can see that you are a
sensation without the weapon.

717
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,261
Still show me the bag.

718
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,334
Fine. Take a look what's in it?

719
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:20,986
Look, there is a pant.

720
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,906
What is this, comb!

721
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,480
This is fried snack, mother had given it.

722
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:26,630
And this is my.. gun.

723
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:28,973
Where did this come from?

724
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:31,046
No, no excuse me, that gun..

725
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:33,005
Lay down your weapon and surrender.

726
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:35,731
I will do that, but first let
me think where did it come from?

727
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:36,922
Lay it down or else..

728
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,802
I will thrash you black and blue.

729
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:42,106
No madam, please don't
come forward, please.

730
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:44,563
Please!
- A fool like you will shoot me.

731
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,829
I will shoot you in the mouth and
it will come out though the ear.

732
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:48,019
Why you..

733
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:50,093
You killed a 'Jaatni'.

734
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,050
He shot the madam, the
station has become a widower.

735
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,459
Madam, are you fine?
- Move back.

736
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:04,301
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! Please Ma'am!

737
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:06,029
You dare scare a
Jaatni with a water gun!

738
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:09,293
If I don't teach you a lesson,
my name isn't Mayawati Chowtala.

739
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,829
Ma'am, sorry ma'am!

740
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,941
Honestly speaking this gun belongs to me.

741
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:14,822
I bought it because holi is approaching.

742
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:17,702
But I was scared seeing you physique..

743
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:19,546
..and I put the gun in his bag.

744
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,349
He is an honest boy,
ma'am, please leave him.

745
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:23,539
Please ma'am.

746
00:33:24,192 --> 00:33:25,805
Spare him.
- Yes ma'am.

747
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:27,917
Tek Chand.

748
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:30,950
Gentleman is asking to spare him.

749
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:33,331
Let him go.
- Thank you madam. Go!

750
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,827
Thank you, ma'am. I am highly obliged!

751
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:37,978
I think I should take
your leave now. Thank you!

752
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:41,280
You will have to give
an application for that.

753
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:43,008
I didn't understand that.
I obliged you..

754
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:44,506
..won't you oblige me?

755
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:46,195
You are too much into
left right isn't it?

756
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,885
Ma'am, please ma'am.
- Come on.

757
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:49,152
It is not about the
question of obligation ma'am!

758
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,573
After a long time I have
caught a sweet man like you.

759
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,070
I won't let you go without a kiss.

760
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:54,029
Ma'am, please.
- Come on. Ma'am, please.

761
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,910
Where are you going?
- There.

762
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:57,638
Where?
- In the left.

763
00:33:57,715 --> 00:33:59,290
Your left or mine.

764
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:01,555
Madam. Madam, senior sir has called.

765
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,126
He would want me to
massage his wife again.

766
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:06,586
Ma'am, please let me go, please.

767
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:09,312
Today I am on duty.

768
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,576
Otherwise a beauty like you has
never escaped me. - Thank you, ma'am.

769
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:13,958
Tek Chand.
- Yes ma'am.

770
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,301
Take down his name and address
and let him go. - Fine madam.

771
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,298
Come on, lets go.
- Yes sir.

772
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,062
I know you must want
me to massage madam.

773
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:23,827
Yes. - I am very sorry.
You are very smart..

774
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:25,555
..you don't seem from
the face but you are.

775
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:28,512
But how did you slip the gun
in my bag, I am surprised.

776
00:34:29,587 --> 00:34:30,662
You were standing in front of me..

777
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,776
..and I was behind you.

778
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:33,680
What do you mean, show it to me?

779
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:34,810
Of course.

780
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,230
You were standing in front of me..

781
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:37,805
..and I was behind you.
You were looking on the left.

782
00:34:37,882 --> 00:34:39,610
Your left! Complete left.

783
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:42,374
I came slyly..
- But your other bag was on the left.

784
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,141
Remembered.
- Oh yes.

785
00:34:45,178 --> 00:34:46,560
You were standing in front
of me and I was behind you.

786
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:47,750
You were looking on the left.

787
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:51,283
I came slyly opened you zip
and slipped the gun in your bag.

788
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:53,203
Did you know?
- No.

789
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,006
But did you know?
- What do you mean?

790
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,466
Here is your gun.

791
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,230
You met me here, don't meet me there.

792
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,094
Understood.

793
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,525
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

794
00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:09,792
How can I help you sir?

795
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,709
I don't even take my
father's help, you know my nature.

796
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,821
No sir, I don't know sir.

797
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:17,741
But I know your nature.

798
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:21,158
Your size is 52, but you wear size 48.

799
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:24,806
48? How do you know, sir?

800
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:27,379
If it would have been 52, then
you wouldn't be adjusting it!

801
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:31,757
Tell me, which room
is booked in my name?

802
00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:34,291
Your name?
- Laxminarayan!

803
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:35,443
Laxminarayan!

804
00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:41,165
Room 504, sir.
- 504, fine.

805
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:43,392
Listen.
- Yes sir.

806
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:45,197
There should have been
a letter in my name.

807
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:46,925
Just a minute sir, I will check it.

808
00:35:51,494 --> 00:35:52,608
Here sir.

809
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:56,755
Fine! Come sir I will show you the room.
- Come.

810
00:35:58,445 --> 00:36:00,096
Excuse me.
- Yes sir.

811
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,784
In which room is Laxminalayan!

812
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:05,510
Laxminalayan or Laxminarayan?

813
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:09,619
Laxminalayan! Not Nalayan, Nalayan.

814
00:36:09,696 --> 00:36:11,117
Give me a moment, I will just check.

815
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,147
Excuse me sir, there is no
one here by the name of..

816
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:18,835
..Mr. Laxminalayan!
- He is not.

817
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:24,019
Wait for a wait!
He will come! He will come!

818
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,851
Welcome sir!
- Hey typing!

819
00:36:33,312 --> 00:36:34,579
There will be a booking in my name.

820
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:35,885
Your name, sir.

821
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:55,238
Think, Laxminarayan,
or what will the people think?

822
00:37:10,138 --> 00:37:11,251
What is he..

823
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,307
Hello.

824
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,992
No sir!

825
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:31,066
I am not like that, sir.

826
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:33,984
You are getting me wrong,
sir. I am not like that, sir.

827
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:35,981
I am from a good family, sir.

828
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:37,440
Sir, my name, sir..

829
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:39,245
See my card, sir, I am Laxminarayan sir.

830
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:42,317
Move aside.
- What? Laxminarayan!

831
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:44,506
No sir, Laxminarayan!

832
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:46,618
I was searching for you.
- Why sir?

833
00:37:46,694 --> 00:37:47,885
Come in the corner.
- No sir.

834
00:37:47,962 --> 00:37:49,306
I don't use oil or cream, sir.

835
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:51,149
Come in the corner..
- I am not like that sir.

836
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:53,107
I will never do it again sir.

837
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:54,566
I beg of you sir.
- Come in!

838
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:57,024
I am a gentleman, sir.
- Go inside.

839
00:37:59,213 --> 00:38:00,403
What are you doing, sir?

840
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:01,939
I am not feeling like it, sir?

841
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:03,898
You can force me.

842
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,046
What are you doing, sir?

843
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:09,888
Sir, I am not like that, sir..

844
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:11,462
Someone has given you wrong information.

845
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,765
My pant was drenched
that's why I was doing that.

846
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:17,299
Sir, please sir.

847
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,757
Here, catch.
- No, I won't.

848
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,254
The boss has given it. Here.

849
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:28,243
The boss had said.

850
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:32,160
It has the complete information,
isn't it?

851
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,850
The job should be taken care of.

852
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,117
It will be done.

853
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:37,958
Otherwise your career.
- No career, sir.

854
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:40,570
I beg of you, sir. The job will be
taken care of. - Okay, take care.

855
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:41,875
The job will be taken care of.

856
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:44,602
You are..

857
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:48,672
Your keys, Mr. Laxminarayan!

858
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,170
No, don't take my name.

859
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,858
Laxminarayan! Don't take the name.

860
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:56,045
I am not talking to you, there is
a courier for Laxminarayan. Yes.

861
00:38:56,122 --> 00:38:58,579
It's for me. You are Laxminarayan?
- Yes.

862
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,307
Is he Laxminarayan?

863
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:01,843
Yes, he is Mr. Laxminarayan!

864
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:04,646
Oh, so you are Laxminarayan!

865
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,258
Sorry, I didn't know you are Laxminarayan!

866
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:09,062
But now it's confirmed
that you are Laxminarayan!

867
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:12,058
Take this and sign here Laxminarayan..

868
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:13,478
..where it is written Laxminarayan.

869
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,437
Thank you Mr. Laxminarayan!

870
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,010
Yes Laxminarayan!

871
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,192
"Enlightened men have said."

872
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,920
"Everyone feels young at heart."

873
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,262
"When it is our turn."

874
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:30,067
"The expiry date always turns old."

875
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:32,026
Is she showing the lingerie
design or design of the car!

876
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,022
"The entire world was empty."

877
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:36,557
"There wasn't anyone crazy in love."

878
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:38,438
"Or any uselessness."

879
00:39:38,515 --> 00:39:41,395
"There wasn't anyone crazy in love."

880
00:39:41,472 --> 00:39:44,698
Do I have to kill her? But why?

881
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:47,539
"There wasn't anyone crazy in love."

882
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:50,688
"Yes, sir"

883
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:52,531
"Spiderman. Spiderman."

884
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:54,566
Mr. Pipite wants to buy this car.
- "Spiderman."

885
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,216
"Spiderman." - Its better if
he buys a cycle for his wife.

886
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:58,790
"Spiderman."

887
00:40:00,902 --> 00:40:01,978
Laila!

888
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:10,848
"One, two, three! One, two, three!"

889
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:12,653
"One, two, three! One, two, three!"

890
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,611
"Tolerating
thousands of difficulties."

891
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:16,301
"To rise up from a plant to a tree."

892
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:25,133
Have you seen this newspaper?

893
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,475
It's written, diamonds
worth 20 crore leads to murder.

894
00:40:27,782 --> 00:40:29,472
20 crore worth diamond..

895
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:31,392
This diamond is worth 20 crore.

896
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:34,656
O my God Chandu, then
we should take it out.

897
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,115
Hey! Have my fear my dear.

898
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:39,341
Tonight we will open the tank
and take the diamond out. - Really?

899
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:42,182
Yes. - We'll have a great fun.
How much money will we..

900
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,294
10 lakh.

901
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:46,906
This car has been sold in 10 lakh.

902
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:49,210
What? This car!

903
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:51,322
It's sold. How is that possible?

904
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:52,973
That's what I am thinking.

905
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,160
The car which no one even came
to take a look at for 7 months.

906
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,696
Someone is coming to buy it.

907
00:40:58,042 --> 00:41:00,346
Who is coming? Laxminarayan.

908
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,150
Today this car won't go anywhere..

909
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:04,070
..because today at 11
o'clock Mr. Laxminarayan..

910
00:41:04,147 --> 00:41:05,530
..is coming to take a look at the car.

911
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:07,910
So both of you make this car shine..

912
00:41:08,026 --> 00:41:10,790
..so that he is dazzled by
the car's shine. - Okay.

913
00:41:11,098 --> 00:41:13,478
Hello. Come and take
your advance at 2 o'clock.

914
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,053
Mr. Laxminarayan is
coming at 11 o'clock!

915
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,704
Chandni! Chandni! What are you doing?

916
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:18,317
What will we do now Chandu?

917
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:20,582
We will lose the
diamond along with the car.

918
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,693
Idea, we won't let
Laxminarayan reach here.

919
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,958
We will kidnap him on the way. Really!

920
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:27,418
I have to close this deal today.

921
00:41:27,494 --> 00:41:29,069
I have to impress
everyone with my charm.

922
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,565
You have to do it, you have no option.

923
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:33,869
Ok? Let's go.

924
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:37,632
Morning sir!

925
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,475
Laxminarayan, nice meeting you sir.

926
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:42,278
No good! No good! No good!

927
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:46,579
Hi, Laxminarayan.

928
00:41:48,461 --> 00:41:50,342
How do you know the name?

929
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,414
Sir I know it since my childhood.

930
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,642
Who told you?

931
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:57,984
Of course sir, my papa.

932
00:41:58,061 --> 00:41:59,750
And who told your papa?

933
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,208
Naturally sir, he will know it.

934
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:04,090
He buys underwear and
vests from my shop..

935
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:05,203
..then he will surely know my name.

936
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,046
Laxminarayan,
underwear and vest seller.

937
00:42:07,147 --> 00:42:08,414
My name is Laxminarayan.

938
00:42:08,966 --> 00:42:12,192
You..
- Yes, and you know my nature.

939
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,766
There is a lot of confusion sir.

940
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:18,067
Sir, my name is Laxminarayan
and I don't know your nature.

941
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:20,333
And I don't want to know it.
Okay sir. - Listen. Hey!

942
00:42:22,982 --> 00:42:24,096
What a strange man.

943
00:42:24,864 --> 00:42:27,245
He knows my name but not my nature.

944
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,546
Excuse me madam.

945
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:33,312
In which room is Laxminarayan?

946
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:38,880
There is Laxminarayan

947
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:48,058
"I am waiting, I am waiting for you."

948
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,742
"I am living a
lonely and restless life."

949
00:42:53,088 --> 00:42:57,350
"Taking you in my arms,
will give me life again."

950
00:42:57,773 --> 00:43:01,920
"My beloved, should be crazy."

951
00:43:02,304 --> 00:43:05,453
"I want a guy that's in my heart."

952
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:23,002
"I want a guy that
immerses in my heart."

953
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:25,267
"I want a guy that
immerses in my eyes."

954
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:27,686
"I want a guy that
immerses in my heart."

955
00:43:27,763 --> 00:43:29,837
"I want a guy that
immerses in my eyes."

956
00:43:29,952 --> 00:43:31,987
"I want a guy that makes me restless."

957
00:43:32,064 --> 00:43:34,330
"I want a guy that
belongs only to me."

958
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:38,630
"I want a guy that immerses in
my heart. Immerses in my heart."

959
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:43,315
"I want a guy that belongs
only to me. Belongs to me."

960
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,078
"Immerses in my heart."

961
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,416
"His name is on my lips."

962
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:54,720
"His image is in my dreams."

963
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,443
"Everyone says he is so dashing."

964
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,882
"I search everywhere for him."

965
00:44:01,978 --> 00:44:04,243
"When will I find him?"

966
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,547
"Guy! Guy! Guy!"

967
00:44:06,624 --> 00:44:09,312
"Guy! Guy! Guy!"

968
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:22,637
"I am waiting, I am waiting for you."

969
00:44:22,752 --> 00:44:27,206
"I am living a
lonely and restless life."

970
00:44:27,283 --> 00:44:29,818
"I want a guy that
will take me to Paris!"

971
00:44:29,894 --> 00:44:31,930
"I want a guy that will
take me around in a Merc."

972
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:34,387
"I want a guy that
will take me to Paris!"

973
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,614
"I want a guy that will
take me around in a Merc."

974
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,842
"A lover that will
shower everything on me."

975
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:41,222
"Adorns me with the
moon and the stars."

976
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:47,136
"I want a guy that immerses in
my heart. Immerses in my heart."

977
00:44:47,213 --> 00:44:52,282
"Immerses in my heart."

978
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:54,355
"Belongs to me."

979
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:59,232
"Everyone is crazy about me."

980
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:01,766
"Everyone loves me."

981
00:45:01,843 --> 00:45:04,224
"The one that will stay in my heart."

982
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:06,490
"He doesn't look at me."

983
00:45:06,566 --> 00:45:08,678
"I am spread my
intoxication every moment."

984
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:11,712
"He might get intoxicated sometime."

985
00:45:13,862 --> 00:45:16,819
"I want a guy!"

986
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:22,886
"I want a guy that
immerses in my heart."

987
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:25,037
"I want a guy that
immerses in my eyes."

988
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:27,264
"I want a guy that makes me restless."

989
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:29,606
"I want a guy that
belongs only to me."

990
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:31,450
"I want a guy that
immerses in my heart."

991
00:45:31,526 --> 00:45:36,384
"Immerses in my heart."

992
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:40,781
"Immerses in my heart."

993
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:47,347
"Immerses in my heart."

994
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:50,342
"Immerses in my heart."

995
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:01,517
Why do people run away when
I take Mr. D'mello's name?

996
00:46:01,632 --> 00:46:02,669
I don't understand.

997
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:06,221
Mr. D'mello.

998
00:46:07,238 --> 00:46:09,197
Mr. D'mello.

999
00:46:18,835 --> 00:46:19,910
Excuse me.

1000
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:26,707
Excuse.. excuse me. Anybody home?

1001
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:36,614
Hello!

1002
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:40,493
Hello! Mr. D'mello!

1003
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,605
Papa, he looks like Laxminarayan!

1004
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,446
Wearing a tie he has come to
kill you in your own house.

1005
00:46:45,523 --> 00:46:47,482
He thinks you are a dog, papa.

1006
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:48,902
Shall I kill him right now, papa?

1007
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,246
No.

1008
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:54,893
Let me first find out,
who is this daring man.

1009
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,582
Who has sent him?

1010
00:46:57,466 --> 00:46:59,808
The car is right here, but I
don't know where they are.

1011
00:47:00,845 --> 00:47:02,266
Seems like they are not at home.

1012
00:47:02,803 --> 00:47:06,106
Oh Hello sir! Nice
meeting you finally.

1013
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:10,752
My name is Laxminarayan! Hands up!

1014
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:12,902
Sir, you are mistaken!

1015
00:47:13,094 --> 00:47:15,859
Misunderstanding sir.
Sir, I am Laxminarayan! Ok.

1016
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:17,818
Put your hands up!

1017
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,082
Which one sir? Left or right? Sir.
- Both.

1018
00:47:21,734 --> 00:47:23,654
Sir.
- "You idiots."

1019
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:26,611
Walk quietly!
- Where, sir?

1020
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,453
Left.. or right, sir?

1021
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,946
Left. Sir, your left or my left sir.

1022
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:40,704
"You idiots."
- Papa!

1023
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:57,139
Does she design bra, panty or cars?

1024
00:47:58,022 --> 00:48:01,670
Laxminarayan, she does her
business in cars just like you.

1025
00:48:01,939 --> 00:48:04,627
Nisha, mail this to Mr. Kumar,
and tell him that I will come..

1026
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:06,355
Excuse me, madam.

1027
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:10,464
Yes.

1028
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:14,592
Madam, you are the one
in the photo isn't it?

1029
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:18,106
Yes. Who are you?

1030
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:20,947
Oh I am Laxminarayan.

1031
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:21,907
And you?

1032
00:48:23,597 --> 00:48:26,400
Hi, I am Laila. I was waiting for you.

1033
00:48:26,746 --> 00:48:30,355
So you do business in car too.
- Yeah!

1034
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,621
Yes, I deal in cars.
I have a car business.

1035
00:48:32,851 --> 00:48:34,272
And you know my nature!

1036
00:48:34,387 --> 00:48:36,115
Even I deal in car.

1037
00:48:36,576 --> 00:48:38,189
Where do you keep the goods?

1038
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:40,032
Goods!

1039
00:48:40,262 --> 00:48:42,490
Goods! This one.

1040
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,445
Seems like you are getting restless.

1041
00:48:46,522 --> 00:48:47,942
Hey since I have seen the photo..

1042
00:48:47,973 --> 00:48:50,853
..I can't take my eyes of it.
It is such a nice design, wow.

1043
00:48:51,437 --> 00:48:54,586
You will never find
something like this anywhere.

1044
00:48:54,662 --> 00:48:57,350
Thank you. If Khurana
sees it, he will be jealous.

1045
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:59,040
Then, are we ready to make the deal.

1046
00:48:59,117 --> 00:49:00,230
Of course. Show me the goods.

1047
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:01,651
You know my nature..

1048
00:49:01,728 --> 00:49:03,686
..I don't make the deal
without seeing the goods. No

1049
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,760
Fair enough. Come, I will show it.

1050
00:49:05,837 --> 00:49:06,912
Come.

1051
00:49:07,526 --> 00:49:09,216
See this gun.

1052
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,213
Seems like it is English make.

1053
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,899
It's Chinese, but
looks absolutely English!

1054
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:19,046
Papa, don't talk to him much.

1055
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,581
He asks a lot of question Papa.

1056
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:23,616
"You idiots."

1057
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:25,440
Sit.

1058
00:49:26,112 --> 00:49:28,570
Where should I sit sir?
On the sofa or the chair?

1059
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:31,565
On the chair?
- Sorry, sir.

1060
00:49:31,642 --> 00:49:32,736
There are so many chairs.

1061
00:49:33,024 --> 00:49:35,366
Which chair? Left
one or the right one.

1062
00:49:37,056 --> 00:49:37,997
Left one.

1063
00:49:38,477 --> 00:49:39,974
Sir, your left or my left sir.

1064
00:49:40,051 --> 00:49:43,430
"You idiot."
- Question paper, come here.

1065
00:49:43,891 --> 00:49:45,082
On this chair.

1066
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:48,614
Dirty.

1067
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:54,566
You really are very daring.
- Thank you, sir.

1068
00:49:54,797 --> 00:49:55,949
You came here directly.

1069
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,600
You couldn't have come, sir,
if I had called you.

1070
00:49:57,784 --> 00:49:59,704
You stay so busy,
that's why I came myself.

1071
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,477
Anyway sir, shall we finish the job.

1072
00:50:03,898 --> 00:50:06,701
Sorry sir, I am in a hurry.

1073
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:11,002
I have to take care of another job.
- What?

1074
00:50:11,347 --> 00:50:12,422
What do you mean?

1075
00:50:13,152 --> 00:50:17,146
After taking care of me, you
will take care of another job.

1076
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,410
Sir, sometimes I have to
take care of 5-4 jobs.

1077
00:50:20,486 --> 00:50:21,984
I stay busy all day sir.

1078
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:24,250
Marvelous.
- Thank you. - Marvelous.

1079
00:50:24,326 --> 00:50:27,859
Learn from him! Learn
from him! Learn from him!

1080
00:50:27,936 --> 00:50:31,738
Excuse me, sir. - Learn from him!
Excuse me sir. - Learn from him

1081
00:50:31,814 --> 00:50:33,619
You always hit me in
front of everyone.

1082
00:50:35,462 --> 00:50:36,499
Sorry.

1083
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:39,302
Sir, can we finish it off now?

1084
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:44,102
Shall we do it here
in front of everyone..

1085
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:45,715
..or somewhere alone?

1086
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:48,595
Papa, he is asking for your choice.

1087
00:50:48,864 --> 00:50:52,512
Would you like to die here,
or.. inside? In private.

1088
00:50:59,462 --> 00:51:01,037
"You fool!"

1089
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:02,342
"You have come to kill me!"

1090
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:04,762
"Are you mad to take a
contract in my name!"

1091
00:51:09,062 --> 00:51:10,099
"You fool!"

1092
00:51:11,098 --> 00:51:12,557
Whom do you work for?

1093
00:51:12,749 --> 00:51:15,898
Sir.. Virus auto, sir,
I had given you my car.

1094
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:17,702
Virus auto!

1095
00:51:18,586 --> 00:51:20,275
Seems like an international gang, Papa!

1096
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:21,926
What's the name of your boss?

1097
00:51:22,003 --> 00:51:23,962
Mr. D.M Pipat, sir. Mr. D.M Pipat, sir.

1098
00:51:24,192 --> 00:51:25,997
Why does Pipat want to kill me?

1099
00:51:26,342 --> 00:51:28,723
Sir, actually he.. kill you!

1100
00:51:28,992 --> 00:51:31,219
Kill you! Why would
he want to kill you, sir?

1101
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,678
Then why have you come to kill me?

1102
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:37,018
Sir I kills.. no sir, K I L L, kill.

1103
00:51:37,248 --> 00:51:40,243
You put an s after every word,
that's not right sir.

1104
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,699
That's Papa's s, he will
use it wherever he wants.

1105
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,770
"You fools." Why do
you want to kill me?

1106
00:51:47,846 --> 00:51:49,421
Why will I kill you sir?

1107
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:53,453
You are joking, right sir.
You are joking. - Hey.

1108
00:51:53,837 --> 00:51:55,987
Papa, don't talk to him kill him..

1109
00:51:56,064 --> 00:51:58,061
..or else he will kill
us with his questions.

1110
00:51:58,138 --> 00:51:59,866
You think my death this is a joke.

1111
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:02,131
Sir, sir, sir, sir,
sir, sir, sir this gun.

1112
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:04,934
Shoot the idiot!
- "You fool, you came to kill me?"

1113
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:07,507
"Are you mad to take a
contract in my name!"

1114
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:09,427
He is dead. Marvelous shooting.
- Yes.

1115
00:52:09,504 --> 00:52:12,653
Marvelous shooting.
- Thanks. Long distance.

1116
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:16,109
Congratulations.
- Albert, papa learnt how to shoot.

1117
00:52:17,376 --> 00:52:18,912
Thanks my children. Excuse me.

1118
00:52:20,026 --> 00:52:23,482
Oh God.
- Mr. D'mello, this is not fair.

1119
00:52:25,018 --> 00:52:27,552
Sir, you know I have
to go for another job.

1120
00:52:27,629 --> 00:52:29,126
Still you ruined my face.

1121
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,160
Where is the bathroom?
Where is the bathroom?

1122
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:34,963
Bathroom.
- Left.

1123
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,922
Your left or mine.

1124
00:52:37,382 --> 00:52:39,302
"You fool."

1125
00:52:40,301 --> 00:52:43,027
Headache has come here again.
- Your Tamil will kill me Ms. Jia.

1126
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:44,218
And yes, M.M. Munde!

1127
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,944
Murli Manohar Munde!
Neither less nor more. Bubblegum!

1128
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:50,246
You asked me to come at 12
o'clock and take the money so..

1129
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:51,898
Whose? Ms. Jia, please.

1130
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:53,702
I am in a very serious
mood today so no jokes.

1131
00:52:53,894 --> 00:52:57,005
Bubblegum! Please. Please.

1132
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,386
Look, Mr.
Laxminarayan hasn't arrived..

1133
00:52:59,462 --> 00:53:01,728
..so you will have to wait
for a while. No Ms. Jia..

1134
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:03,917
..now no more waiting, please.

1135
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:07,334
Actually, I am not feeling
well and I am a bit hot tempered.

1136
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:09,254
Then cool it, and have coconut water.

1137
00:53:09,331 --> 00:53:11,136
Not coconut Ms. Jia!
No coconut, please.

1138
00:53:11,482 --> 00:53:13,440
I don't like coconut. You
please give me the money.

1139
00:53:14,669 --> 00:53:16,781
Then sit comfortably
below that coconut tree.

1140
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:19,776
No coconut! Ms. Jia, why are
you saying coconut all the time?

1141
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:24,307
Either you give the money,
or I will take it.

1142
00:53:24,384 --> 00:53:25,421
Sorry. Simple.

1143
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:28,646
Sir.
- Yes! - Cold drink or tea?

1144
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,872
Can I have some water?

1145
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:34,022
Ms. Jia, someone fired a bullet..

1146
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:37,248
Is it that you have called
goons to kill this Munde.

1147
00:53:37,363 --> 00:53:40,051
Mr. Munde, there are no goons here.
Munde! Mr. Murli Manohar Munde.

1148
00:53:40,128 --> 00:53:42,931
Neither less nor more.
- Your bubblegum. - Thank you..

1149
00:53:43,008 --> 00:53:44,544
..very much. But Munde
won't be scared of any goon.

1150
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,502
Remember that. Wait here,
I will just come.

1151
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:48,384
Listen, wait here, why
are you coming after me?

1152
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:51,648
What the hell. Where
is that Laxminarayan?

1153
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:54,221
Jia, could it be that
he is somewhere around..

1154
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,411
..but he can't recognise you.

1155
00:53:56,563 --> 00:53:57,984
Yes, it is possible.

1156
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:00,326
Eat something.

1157
00:54:01,056 --> 00:54:02,976
Excuse me, I need to
announce one name.

1158
00:54:04,049 --> 00:54:05,585
Laxminarayan!

1159
00:54:08,774 --> 00:54:10,541
Sir, I didn't come to kill you!

1160
00:54:10,618 --> 00:54:11,885
I didn't come to kill you!

1161
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:14,803
Sir, trust me sir, I
didn't come to kill you!

1162
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,186
Then, who have you come to kill?

1163
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:18,336
I haven't come here to kill anyone.

1164
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:21,850
Mr. Pipat, my boss. He
asked me to meet you.

1165
00:54:21,907 --> 00:54:23,846
You can ask Mr. Pipat!

1166
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,901
Give me his number.

1167
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,648
Fax number or phone number sir.

1168
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:29,856
Phones. Landline or
mobile number, sir?

1169
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,352
Mobile. India or Singapore, sir?

1170
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:33,773
Where is your boss?

1171
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:34,886
Sir, he is in London?

1172
00:54:35,078 --> 00:54:36,653
Then why did you say Singapore?

1173
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,573
Sir, I was scared.
Please leave me. Please.

1174
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,878
I will give you the number.

1175
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:43,334
00447866789!

1176
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:44,870
Very small. Here.

1177
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:47,558
It will ring! It is ringing!
He will pick it up.

1178
00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:50,285
Sir, my boss is a very educated man.

1179
00:54:50,362 --> 00:54:52,742
Oxford University, I
am his special man.

1180
00:54:53,702 --> 00:54:57,466
He will pick it up! Actually sir,
time difference in the morning..

1181
00:54:57,542 --> 00:55:00,845
Hello. - Hello, hello, hello sir.
Laxminarayan here, sir, from Pondi.

1182
00:55:01,435 --> 00:55:05,006
Who Laxmi? - Your Laxminarayan,
sir, from Pondi sir.

1183
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:06,701
You fool, did you get the job done?

1184
00:55:06,874 --> 00:55:08,506
Sir, there is a small problem.

1185
00:55:08,525 --> 00:55:09,792
That's why I called you.

1186
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:13,574
Laxminarayan you idiot, I don't
want any excuses. I want results.

1187
00:55:13,632 --> 00:55:17,050
You fool, you lousy fool,
stupid, idiot.

1188
00:55:17,242 --> 00:55:18,624
Call me when the job
is taken care off..

1189
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:20,045
Abusing in Hindi from London.
- Sir.

1190
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:21,658
Or else I will shoot you.
- I know you love me sir.

1191
00:55:21,734 --> 00:55:23,117
Lousy idiot!
- Sir.

1192
00:55:25,459 --> 00:55:27,994
I think he hanged down the phone.
Internet call sometimes.

1193
00:55:30,566 --> 00:55:33,446
Papa, I had told you earlier.
Kill him.

1194
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:36,672
What?
- "You fool." - Thank you papa. Sir!

1195
00:55:36,749 --> 00:55:38,822
Why did you do like this sir? This?

1196
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:40,896
You ordered him to kill me, isn't it sir?

1197
00:55:41,242 --> 00:55:43,392
You cannot do this sir. Try and under..

1198
00:55:45,504 --> 00:55:46,810
Sir, what is this sir?

1199
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,499
Even papa doesn't know.
- Danger?

1200
00:55:48,576 --> 00:55:50,381
Look sir, it is so comfortable.

1201
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:52,109
To sit, to lie down.

1202
00:55:52,339 --> 00:55:54,490
You don't even have to adjust it.

1203
00:55:54,566 --> 00:55:56,794
Absolutely, it should be comfortable..

1204
00:55:56,909 --> 00:55:57,946
..while getting up and sitting down.

1205
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,674
Yes.
- Otherwise people complain.

1206
00:56:00,326 --> 00:56:03,552
They have to adjust every time.

1207
00:56:03,629 --> 00:56:05,510
You are right.
- Gents can do it.

1208
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:06,816
Yes.

1209
00:56:06,893 --> 00:56:08,582
But ladies face more problems!
- Yes.

1210
00:56:11,232 --> 00:56:12,269
Show me.

1211
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:14,074
I showed it.

1212
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:17,107
You showed me the
effect and side effect.

1213
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:18,643
Show me the goods.

1214
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:20,794
What more do you want to see?

1215
00:56:22,406 --> 00:56:23,443
This.

1216
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:25,056
This.

1217
00:56:25,594 --> 00:56:27,168
I have been showing
you this since then.

1218
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:29,702
Madam, what you have been
showing since then is nice..

1219
00:56:29,779 --> 00:56:33,274
..but I am a
complete business man. Yes.

1220
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:35,846
Until I don't see the real thing,
I don't take the delivery.

1221
00:56:36,077 --> 00:56:37,498
Show me the real good. This one.

1222
00:56:37,882 --> 00:56:40,301
Show me the red colour
underwear and vest. Full piece.

1223
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,106
What?

1224
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:44,486
These are your boss's goods.

1225
00:56:48,403 --> 00:56:50,376
'O God, boss's diamonds.'
- I am sorry.

1226
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,853
I delayed a bit, your
boss must be angry with me?

1227
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,003
He is very angry with you.

1228
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,038
Please tell him sorry on my behalf.

1229
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:03,494
I will always be indebted to you.

1230
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:07,027
Please. I am very tense.

1231
00:57:08,794 --> 00:57:10,522
I am.. sorry.

1232
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:13,478
Please, just try and understand.

1233
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:17,472
Excuse me.

1234
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,547
I will just come.

1235
00:57:20,352 --> 00:57:24,998
"I am helpless, hopeless and useless."

1236
00:57:25,728 --> 00:57:26,842
I cannot kill him.

1237
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:29,184
Now that she has
returned brother's diamonds..

1238
00:57:29,261 --> 00:57:30,336
..then why should I kill him?

1239
00:57:38,477 --> 00:57:40,550
Seems like there is a
power failure, papa!

1240
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,662
Now it will only
return tomorrow, papa.

1241
00:57:43,354 --> 00:57:47,962
Excuse me. Don't you have inverters?
- What?

1242
00:57:48,576 --> 00:57:50,189
Don't you have inverters?

1243
00:57:50,688 --> 00:57:52,992
Why you..
- Papa, he is challenging you.

1244
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,656
I will bring the inverter.
- Wait.

1245
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,446
Papa, forget about the electricity..

1246
00:57:57,523 --> 00:57:59,174
..kill him with the bomb.

1247
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,131
Excuse me sir, I am
not that Laxminarayan.

1248
00:58:02,323 --> 00:58:03,898
It must be some other Laxminarayan.

1249
00:58:03,974 --> 00:58:05,318
I am not him..

1250
00:58:10,579 --> 00:58:11,693
Has he gone mad?

1251
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,112
Sir, he is Laxminarayan!
He is Laxminarayan!

1252
00:58:14,189 --> 00:58:15,610
He stays in my hotel.

1253
00:58:15,686 --> 00:58:17,069
I have seen him, sir.

1254
00:58:17,146 --> 00:58:19,104
Please release me, sir.

1255
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:20,717
It is the question of my job.

1256
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:23,098
He is putting up a charade, papa.

1257
00:58:23,174 --> 00:58:24,749
There is another Laxminarayan, sir.

1258
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:28,474
He is staying in
room number 500.. 504.

1259
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,125
I am not that Laxminarayan, sir.

1260
00:58:30,202 --> 00:58:32,160
He is that Laxminarayan,
who has come to kill you..

1261
00:58:32,237 --> 00:58:33,274
..the underwear and vest one.

1262
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,806
"You fool."

1263
00:58:36,883 --> 00:58:39,034
If what you say turns
out to be false, then..

1264
00:58:39,379 --> 00:58:43,104
Sir, you are talking as if you
will do whatever I will tell you.

1265
00:58:43,411 --> 00:58:45,562
Do whatever you wish too!

1266
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:48,710
Marvelous idea.

1267
00:58:48,979 --> 00:58:50,477
Come on, show me.

1268
00:58:50,938 --> 00:58:53,203
Who is that other Laxminarayan?
Come on.

1269
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,390
Papa, you took the tie..

1270
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:58,426
..who will bring the
person wearing the tie along?

1271
00:58:59,731 --> 00:59:00,845
Don't worry.

1272
00:59:00,922 --> 00:59:02,496
If you want the money, then
you will have to show the goods.

1273
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:03,686
That's how it is?

1274
00:59:03,763 --> 00:59:05,606
Seems like you don't
know business. Bye.

1275
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,987
I have been selling underwear
and vests for the past 40 years.

1276
00:59:08,064 --> 00:59:10,022
Stop! You..

1277
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:13,248
I will stop if you show me the goods.

1278
00:59:13,478 --> 00:59:14,630
Otherwise, I won't.

1279
00:59:17,165 --> 00:59:18,317
'What are you thinking Laila?'

1280
00:59:18,432 --> 00:59:19,699
'If this deal is not finalised..

1281
00:59:19,776 --> 00:59:21,197
..then you won't be able to
pay the bank installment.'

1282
00:59:21,312 --> 00:59:23,194
'And if you don't pay
the bank installment..

1283
00:59:23,232 --> 00:59:24,269
..then you will lose everything.'

1284
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,573
But you will look at
it from a distance.

1285
00:59:27,763 --> 00:59:32,179
And you won't tell anyone about it.

1286
00:59:37,901 --> 00:59:38,938
Fine!

1287
00:59:39,168 --> 00:59:40,243
Show it.

1288
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:42,317
But, not here.

1289
00:59:42,341 --> 00:59:43,339
Then where?

1290
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,082
In your hotel.

1291
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:47,923
Fine. Come, then.

1292
00:59:48,936 --> 00:59:50,626
Tell me, who fired the bullet?

1293
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:52,608
The bullet was fired from
that direction, we were here.

1294
00:59:55,987 --> 00:59:58,752
Why you.. Gatotkutch!
- Yes, madam.

1295
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,979
Isn't he that boy without the gun?

1296
01:00:01,094 --> 01:00:02,400
I, too, think so, madam.

1297
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:03,898
Come on.
- Yes, madam.

1298
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:08,429
So sensational! What are you doing?

1299
01:00:08,698 --> 01:00:12,154
Did you fire at this Munde?

1300
01:00:12,499 --> 01:00:13,805
Tek Chand.
- Yes, madam.

1301
01:00:13,882 --> 01:00:15,456
Search this boy.

1302
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:17,798
Yes.
- If you don't mind, sir.

1303
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:19,334
Why do you always search people?

1304
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:20,870
Don't you know?

1305
01:00:20,947 --> 01:00:24,134
Police never leave the chance
of taking anything. Understand.

1306
01:00:24,326 --> 01:00:25,632
Come with us to the 'Thane'.
(Police station).

1307
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,744
Why Thane, I live in Ghatkopar?

1308
01:00:27,859 --> 01:00:30,125
If you act too smart, I will kill you.

1309
01:00:30,202 --> 01:00:31,814
Then you will cry all your life.

1310
01:00:31,968 --> 01:00:33,043
Madam, your button is open.

1311
01:00:33,466 --> 01:00:34,541
Oh! Catch him.

1312
01:00:34,618 --> 01:00:37,306
Madam.
- Not me, him! You idiot!

1313
01:00:38,074 --> 01:00:41,030
Madam.
- Mr. Laxminarayan, my money!

1314
01:00:41,184 --> 01:00:42,682
Hey, where did you go?

1315
01:00:42,758 --> 01:00:45,523
Ms. Jia, where are you
running to, speaking in Tamil?

1316
01:00:48,442 --> 01:00:50,054
Laxminarayan! Laxminarayan!

1317
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:52,781
"One two, three.."
Catch him! Catch him!

1318
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:53,894
"Coming in the world is free."
- Tek Chand, run.

1319
01:00:53,971 --> 01:00:56,237
"Going from the world is
free." - Catch him. Stop!

1320
01:00:56,314 --> 01:00:57,811
"See the drama of the world"
- Stop!

1321
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:59,731
"Absolutely free."
- Ms. Jia, stop.

1322
01:00:59,808 --> 01:01:03,034
Catch him! Catch his legs.
I caught it, madam.

1323
01:01:03,072 --> 01:01:06,259
Not mine, his.
- Let go! Catch him, not me.

1324
01:01:06,682 --> 01:01:08,717
I won't spare you. Let me go.

1325
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:11,482
Tek Chand, come on.

1326
01:01:11,827 --> 01:01:13,632
Laxminarayan!
- Ms. Jia!

1327
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,782
"Everybody say, you fools."

1328
01:01:18,432 --> 01:01:19,469
Follow me.

1329
01:01:20,006 --> 01:01:22,272
"How dare you"

1330
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:24,883
"you want to get me killed?"

1331
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:26,458
I will get down first.

1332
01:01:26,534 --> 01:01:27,994
I will help papa cross. Me..
- Me.

1333
01:01:28,032 --> 01:01:29,338
I will help Papa cross.

1334
01:01:29,414 --> 01:01:32,102
Excuse me, can I help you across?
- Okay.

1335
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:33,216
By going there?
- Okay.

1336
01:01:33,446 --> 01:01:35,866
Okay. First you help
me across. Carefully.

1337
01:01:38,093 --> 01:01:39,053
Give me your hand.

1338
01:01:39,898 --> 01:01:43,085
Which hand sir, left or right?
- 'One, two, three.'

1339
01:01:43,162 --> 01:01:44,813
Give me any hand, or else
I won't be able to cross.

1340
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,572
Oh!

1341
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:49,306
Very good.

1342
01:01:49,382 --> 01:01:51,610
Catch him. Don't run.

1343
01:01:51,994 --> 01:01:54,144
Papa, don't worry, we are with you.

1344
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:59,765
"He has come out of the frying pan!"

1345
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:01,862
"He has landed into the fire."

1346
01:02:05,678 --> 01:02:07,483
"He has come out of the frying pan!"

1347
01:02:07,507 --> 01:02:09,312
"He has landed into the fire."

1348
01:02:09,389 --> 01:02:11,424
"He doesn't accept his crimes."

1349
01:02:11,501 --> 01:02:13,152
"He has been forced too."

1350
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:16,992
"Meera danced tying the anklet."

1351
01:02:20,986 --> 01:02:22,752
"Meera danced tying the anklet."

1352
01:02:22,829 --> 01:02:24,864
"You dance without the anklet."

1353
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:28,742
"Sway and dance."

1354
01:02:28,819 --> 01:02:33,965
"If you fall, then take my advice."

1355
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:38,266
"Only after lots of effort,
does a plant turn into a tree."

1356
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:44,141
"Only after lots of effort,
does a plant turn into a tree."

1357
01:02:45,408 --> 01:02:46,483
You go to the right.

1358
01:02:47,405 --> 01:02:49,517
You go to the left and look for him.
- Okay.

1359
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,205
And me.

1360
01:02:52,742 --> 01:02:56,698
"My dear, careful! Girl, look out."

1361
01:02:57,043 --> 01:02:59,078
"One, two, three! One, two, three!"

1362
01:02:59,194 --> 01:03:01,037
"Coming into the world is free!"

1363
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,918
"Going from the world is free."

1364
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:07,181
Sir, sorry, sir.

1365
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:09,254
You will murder me!

1366
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,098
Sir, that Laxminarayan is someone else.

1367
01:03:11,122 --> 01:03:12,902
I will kill you.

1368
01:03:13,018 --> 01:03:15,014
Why will you kill me?
- You are after me?

1369
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,318
Sir, I am not after me.
- You dare take my contract.

1370
01:03:17,434 --> 01:03:18,931
Sir, I didn't take any contract..

1371
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:24,307
Can't you watch where you are going?

1372
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:25,613
Yes, I can't watch
where I am going so?

1373
01:03:26,304 --> 01:03:28,070
You hit me!
- Yes, I hit you, so?

1374
01:03:28,992 --> 01:03:30,374
If he wouldn't have
been along with me..

1375
01:03:30,957 --> 01:03:32,685
..then I would have killed you.

1376
01:03:32,832 --> 01:03:34,406
Who wouldn't have been with you?
- Him!

1377
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:36,480
Where did he go?

1378
01:03:37,133 --> 01:03:40,704
Help! Help!

1379
01:03:40,781 --> 01:03:41,818
Pinto.

1380
01:03:48,461 --> 01:03:50,266
"Run, Run! Sprint, sprint!"

1381
01:03:50,342 --> 01:03:52,070
"Don't sleep, wake up."

1382
01:03:52,147 --> 01:03:53,914
"There is trouble behind you."

1383
01:03:53,952 --> 01:03:55,104
"Pick up your pace and run."

1384
01:03:55,181 --> 01:03:56,410
Hold, there is a
police woman in the front.

1385
01:03:56,486 --> 01:03:58,906
"Lose your pride,
lose your arrogance."

1386
01:03:58,982 --> 01:04:00,787
Laxminarayan, I will not spare you.
- "Everything is distorted."

1387
01:04:00,864 --> 01:04:02,477
"Since I have been
kicked in the back."

1388
01:04:02,501 --> 01:04:05,357
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on, move.

1389
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:06,509
Yes, madam.

1390
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:07,968
"There are desires in the heart."

1391
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:09,773
"Your mind says that."

1392
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:13,267
"Only when you sweat it out,
can you buy an A/C!"

1393
01:04:13,344 --> 01:04:15,072
"One, two three! And One, two three!"

1394
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,877
"One, two three!"

1395
01:04:16,992 --> 01:04:18,605
"Tolerating thousands of difficulties."

1396
01:04:18,682 --> 01:04:20,602
"To rise up from a plant to a tree."

1397
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:23,213
Chandu, where is that Laxminarayan?

1398
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:26,592
This way! No, no this way,
come on, quickly!

1399
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:32,736
"One, two, three! One, two, three!"

1400
01:04:32,813 --> 01:04:34,541
"Coming into the world is free!"

1401
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,998
"Going from the world is free."
- There he is, catch him.

1402
01:04:37,114 --> 01:04:40,570
"Absolutely free! Absolutely
free!" My money. - Ms. Jia, stop.

1403
01:04:41,914 --> 01:04:44,294
Laxmi.
- Come on.

1404
01:04:47,712 --> 01:04:50,170
O God! Where did he go?

1405
01:04:50,246 --> 01:04:52,166
Laxminarayan, stop!

1406
01:04:53,165 --> 01:04:55,392
Look, don't follow me.

1407
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,542
Look, your boss must have told you..

1408
01:04:57,619 --> 01:04:59,693
..to give something
more in exchange of this.

1409
01:05:00,576 --> 01:05:02,150
Then give that, and go.

1410
01:05:03,226 --> 01:05:05,645
No! But how can I give you that?

1411
01:05:06,029 --> 01:05:07,334
You are so young.

1412
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,101
What does it have to do with age?

1413
01:05:09,293 --> 01:05:10,906
You know, younger people than me..

1414
01:05:10,982 --> 01:05:12,826
..have progressed more than me.

1415
01:05:13,133 --> 01:05:16,166
But I cannot do the same with you.

1416
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,741
I am sorry.

1417
01:05:17,894 --> 01:05:19,008
I am sorry.

1418
01:05:25,344 --> 01:05:28,416
Laxmi, you were my last hope.

1419
01:05:29,184 --> 01:05:33,062
And if you betray me,
then what will happen to me?

1420
01:05:33,754 --> 01:05:35,827
Kill me! Kill me!

1421
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:38,707
Kill me! I want to rise up!

1422
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:41,050
Kill me! Kill me Laxmi! Kill me!
Kill me! Please. Let me go!

1423
01:05:41,126 --> 01:05:42,816
Kill me Laxmi!
- Let me go!

1424
01:05:43,546 --> 01:05:44,698
Let me go!

1425
01:05:45,158 --> 01:05:46,656
Please Laxmi.

1426
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,069
What did you do?

1427
01:05:53,146 --> 01:05:54,720
I stopped him from going.
Come on, pick him up.

1428
01:05:54,797 --> 01:05:56,640
Don't touch him, he
is my Laxminarayan.

1429
01:05:56,717 --> 01:05:58,099
No, he is our Laxminarayan.

1430
01:05:58,176 --> 01:06:00,480
He is mine!
- He is our piece.

1431
01:06:00,672 --> 01:06:02,131
Do you think he is a piece?
He is Laxminarayan.

1432
01:06:02,669 --> 01:06:03,898
He is mine.
- No, he is ours.

1433
01:06:03,974 --> 01:06:05,894
He is mine.
- No, he is ours. - Just a minute.

1434
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:08,352
Yes, madam.
- Chandu, where are you?

1435
01:06:08,659 --> 01:06:09,734
You know, Mr.
Laxminarayan was supposed to come..

1436
01:06:09,811 --> 01:06:10,886
..here at 11 o'clock.

1437
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:13,690
Madam. - Yes madam, but
your Laxminarayan is here.

1438
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:15,840
He is standing here with me.

1439
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:18,758
Come here quickly, I have to leave.

1440
01:06:19,027 --> 01:06:20,218
Yes, come fast okay.

1441
01:06:20,294 --> 01:06:21,446
Okay.
- Thank you.

1442
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:24,672
Two minutes more sir, please.

1443
01:06:24,826 --> 01:06:26,976
He is not our Laxminarayan!

1444
01:06:27,514 --> 01:06:29,549
I told you he is my Laxminarayan!
- Yes.

1445
01:06:29,626 --> 01:06:31,930
This is yours too, come on run.
- Get lost.

1446
01:06:34,579 --> 01:06:35,731
Laxmi!

1447
01:06:41,261 --> 01:06:45,600
"Everywhere you get, one on one free."

1448
01:06:45,677 --> 01:06:52,589
"The one who knows how to read,
it is beneficial for him."

1449
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:03,802
Excuse me! Sorry!

1450
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:06,720
Life is precious. To
hell with the show.

1451
01:07:12,058 --> 01:07:13,133
My check out time, sir!

1452
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:15,245
Good morning, sir!
Looking very fresh today, sir!

1453
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,358
Me? Thank you, sir!

1454
01:07:16,435 --> 01:07:18,547
Sir, I want to checkout!
Please make my bill!

1455
01:07:18,624 --> 01:07:20,237
Why, sir? You were
supposed to leave tomorrow.

1456
01:07:20,352 --> 01:07:21,542
Yes, but I want to leave now.

1457
01:07:21,811 --> 01:07:23,501
Sir, please make my bill. Sir, please.

1458
01:07:23,654 --> 01:07:25,190
Any problem, sir?

1459
01:07:25,267 --> 01:07:27,840
No problem, sir. Make my bill.
I want to checkout.

1460
01:07:28,032 --> 01:07:30,413
Room not comfortable, sir?

1461
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,832
No! Very comfortable! Sir,
please hurry up! Sir, please.

1462
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:35,174
Food not good, sir?
- My luck is not good!

1463
01:07:35,827 --> 01:07:36,979
Will you change it?

1464
01:07:37,939 --> 01:07:39,053
What kind of a man are you?

1465
01:07:39,245 --> 01:07:41,165
You are going on asking questions!

1466
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,238
Please! I want to checkout! Please!

1467
01:07:45,965 --> 01:07:47,270
Life is very precious.
To hell with the..

1468
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:49,382
"You fools."

1469
01:07:53,299 --> 01:07:54,912
Come!
- Yes!

1470
01:07:56,693 --> 01:07:57,845
Why are you laughing, fool?

1471
01:07:57,869 --> 01:07:59,866
Catch everybody!
Check what the matter is!

1472
01:08:00,173 --> 01:08:01,210
Yes, ma'am!

1473
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:02,438
Mrs. Sinha! Come on!

1474
01:08:02,515 --> 01:08:04,013
Ma'am! Inspector ma'am!

1475
01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:05,510
Did you recognise me?

1476
01:08:06,509 --> 01:08:10,003
You are Mayawati Chowtala's man!
How can I forget you?

1477
01:08:10,502 --> 01:08:14,611
What has happened to you?
What happened?

1478
01:08:15,072 --> 01:08:16,877
Did you collide with a truck?

1479
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,795
Something like that!
Please ma'am, take me with you!

1480
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:24,480
My dear! You are irresistible!

1481
01:08:24,672 --> 01:08:28,128
But what to do? I am on duty.
I can't do much.

1482
01:08:28,228 --> 01:08:29,533
Ma'am!
- Found him?

1483
01:08:29,702 --> 01:08:30,893
Ma'am, didn't find Laxminarayan!

1484
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:32,390
What? Ma'am, I am Laxminarayan!

1485
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:34,541
Quiet! Let's search there.
- Okay, ma'am!

1486
01:08:34,618 --> 01:08:36,192
Bye! See you again!

1487
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,882
Ma'am, please! Take me,
ma'am! Take me!

1488
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:40,570
Take me? Did you take Viagra?

1489
01:08:40,594 --> 01:08:42,322
That you can't
control yourself? Come on!

1490
01:08:42,643 --> 01:08:44,832
Ma'am! Ma'am, take me with you, ma'am!

1491
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:48,096
Because those three people,
they are following me!

1492
01:08:48,365 --> 01:08:51,974
Move back! Don't
play with my feelings!

1493
01:08:52,627 --> 01:08:54,048
Otherwise I will kill you!

1494
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,968
But why?
- Then you will regret!

1495
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:58,272
Move back! Go!
- Ma'am!

1496
01:08:58,925 --> 01:09:01,690
Tek Chand!
- Ma'am! - Quiet! Move back! - Ma'am!

1497
01:09:02,765 --> 01:09:05,645
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! I
am the same Laxminarayan!

1498
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:07,704
Ma'am! Ma'am! I am not Laxminarayan!

1499
01:09:08,179 --> 01:09:11,712
Ma'am! I was telling you
that I am not Laxminarayan!

1500
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:12,998
Come!

1501
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,627
Yes, sir!
- I want to check in, sir!

1502
01:09:17,011 --> 01:09:19,546
Are you sure, sir?
- Yes, sir!

1503
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:20,990
Get in! Get in! Get in!

1504
01:09:21,197 --> 01:09:22,771
Sir! Sir, please!

1505
01:09:22,848 --> 01:09:25,498
Shut up! If you utter a
single word, I will shoot you!

1506
01:09:25,574 --> 01:09:26,918
No, sir!

1507
01:09:35,866 --> 01:09:37,210
No, sir!
- Laxmi!

1508
01:09:37,747 --> 01:09:41,472
No, sir! No, sir! No, sir!

1509
01:09:56,947 --> 01:09:58,138
Come

1510
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,710
One minute! Stop him! Stop him!

1511
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:04,282
Fool, I am pointing a gun at you!
Still you are flirting with a girl!

1512
01:10:04,306 --> 01:10:05,534
And you are making
me flirt with her too!

1513
01:10:05,856 --> 01:10:06,893
No, sir! Never, sir!

1514
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,427
I was just telling you that
he is the same Laxminarayan..

1515
01:10:09,504 --> 01:10:11,155
..who had come to shoot you.
- What! - Yes!

1516
01:10:11,232 --> 01:10:12,538
Why didn't you say he is the one?

1517
01:10:12,614 --> 01:10:14,227
You only said to keep my mouth shut!

1518
01:10:14,304 --> 01:10:16,915
You! - I think he is a
cunning man! - No, sir!

1519
01:10:16,992 --> 01:10:19,872
He would have beaten you
with that girl's sandals!

1520
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,830
Hey!
- Like that day!

1521
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:25,363
Come on, ma'am! I have
freshened up! Now show!

1522
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:30,163
I.. I never showed
it to somebody before.

1523
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:31,781
What? You didn't show it?

1524
01:10:32,344 --> 01:10:33,727
How do you do your business?

1525
01:10:34,349 --> 01:10:36,845
Please don't call it business.
It sounds very cheap!

1526
01:10:36,922 --> 01:10:38,074
What cheap, ma'am!

1527
01:10:38,266 --> 01:10:39,610
In our business the customer doesn't..

1528
01:10:39,686 --> 01:10:41,702
..touch without seeing the goods.

1529
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,334
And we too have to show it.

1530
01:10:44,141 --> 01:10:45,792
You too show it?
- Yes!

1531
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:47,443
And you know my nature!

1532
01:10:47,635 --> 01:10:51,475
And ladies check everything!
Is it loose? Is the size proper?

1533
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:52,819
We have to show everything.

1534
01:10:52,843 --> 01:10:54,725
I've been doing this
business for the past 40 years.

1535
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:58,694
Show it.

1536
01:10:59,232 --> 01:11:00,307
Look!
- Yes!

1537
01:11:00,384 --> 01:11:02,035
Its only about seeing, right?

1538
01:11:06,758 --> 01:11:07,987
But who hit me?

1539
01:11:08,218 --> 01:11:09,485
I don't know! There were two of them!

1540
01:11:09,562 --> 01:11:12,096
They hit you with a stick and
they were going to take you.

1541
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:13,632
Then I stopped them
and told them that..

1542
01:11:13,709 --> 01:11:15,130
..he is my Laxminarayan!

1543
01:11:15,782 --> 01:11:17,203
You said that?
- Yes!

1544
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,584
Then they spoke on
the phone and ran away!

1545
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,658
And then you brought me here!

1546
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:25,037
How could I have left you there..

1547
01:11:25,152 --> 01:11:26,765
..in that state, Laxminarayan?

1548
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:28,992
Has it stopped paining?

1549
01:11:30,605 --> 01:11:32,294
The pain has just started.

1550
01:11:36,902 --> 01:11:38,285
What are you doing?

1551
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:42,202
Why are you removing your clothes?

1552
01:11:42,278 --> 01:11:44,045
If I won't remove it
then how will I show it?

1553
01:11:45,082 --> 01:11:48,576
I don't want it!
It's wrong! It's wrong!

1554
01:11:48,845 --> 01:11:51,648
I know your nature!
But you know my nature!

1555
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:53,722
Laxmi! - I am not such a man!
- Laxmi! Laxmi! Laxmi!

1556
01:11:53,798 --> 01:11:56,640
You go!
- Laxmi! Relax!

1557
01:11:56,717 --> 01:12:00,019
These things happen in
this age! I know! Just relax!

1558
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:03,629
"Secretly. Secretly."

1559
01:12:04,742 --> 01:12:06,163
"Secretly. Secretly."

1560
01:12:07,277 --> 01:12:08,736
"Secretly. Secretly."

1561
01:12:09,811 --> 01:12:11,309
"Secretly. Secretly."

1562
01:12:12,614 --> 01:12:14,842
"These talks and meetings are secret."

1563
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:19,181
"Beloved, don't leave me."

1564
01:12:19,373 --> 01:12:21,446
"Don't go."

1565
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:26,515
"The twilights are asleep.
My breaths are lost and awakened."

1566
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:29,304
"Beloved, don't leave me."

1567
01:12:29,626 --> 01:12:32,006
"Don't go."

1568
01:12:32,621 --> 01:12:37,267
"You have just dwelled in my heart."

1569
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:42,528
"You have just come in my dreams."

1570
01:12:42,835 --> 01:12:47,597
"You have just come in my arms."

1571
01:12:47,981 --> 01:12:49,824
"Don't go."

1572
01:12:50,093 --> 01:12:52,704
"Don't go."

1573
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:55,162
"Don't go."

1574
01:12:57,542 --> 01:13:02,573
"Don't go."

1575
01:13:02,995 --> 01:13:06,528
"These talks and meetings are secret."

1576
01:13:06,605 --> 01:13:10,176
"Beloved, don't leave me."

1577
01:13:10,522 --> 01:13:13,248
"Don't go."

1578
01:13:13,978 --> 01:13:17,664
"The twilights are asleep.
My breaths are lost and awakened."

1579
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:21,466
"Beloved, don't leave me."

1580
01:13:21,542 --> 01:13:23,078
"Don't go."

1581
01:13:23,155 --> 01:13:25,306
"Everybody say. Fool!"

1582
01:13:25,613 --> 01:13:28,070
"Fool!"

1583
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,757
"Fool, you have come to kill me."

1584
01:13:31,795 --> 01:13:34,138
"You are mad that you came here."

1585
01:13:34,214 --> 01:13:36,710
"Boss, he is loose like a kite."

1586
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,322
"Sir, here there is
electricity 24 hours."

1587
01:13:39,398 --> 01:13:40,550
"Hey, fool!"

1588
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:43,315
"Look at the man on the right."

1589
01:13:43,392 --> 01:13:45,120
"Sorry, sir. A slight confusion."

1590
01:13:45,197 --> 01:13:47,040
"Your right or my right?"

1591
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,574
"Oh shut up! Shut up!"
- "He is angry."

1592
01:13:49,651 --> 01:13:51,149
"People on my left."

1593
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:52,262
"Really, really angry.
- Really, really angry."

1594
01:13:52,339 --> 01:13:54,797
"I will kill you in one go."

1595
01:13:54,851 --> 01:13:58,307
"Go? You mean I can go? Thank you!"

1596
01:13:58,752 --> 01:14:01,056
"Somebody make him quiet."

1597
01:14:01,133 --> 01:14:02,746
"Secretly. Secretly."

1598
01:14:03,782 --> 01:14:05,203
"Secretly. Secretly."

1599
01:14:06,202 --> 01:14:07,699
"Secretly. Secretly."

1600
01:14:08,928 --> 01:14:10,464
"Secretly. Secretly."

1601
01:14:30,662 --> 01:14:40,646
"I want to sleep in your tresses."

1602
01:14:41,606 --> 01:14:50,976
"I want to lose myself
in you all the time."

1603
01:14:53,357 --> 01:15:00,058
"In my fervour I tell you."

1604
01:15:03,571 --> 01:15:11,942
"In my fervour I tell you."

1605
01:15:12,557 --> 01:15:15,821
"Don't go."

1606
01:15:15,898 --> 01:15:18,470
"These talks and meetings are secret."

1607
01:15:18,509 --> 01:15:22,118
"Beloved, don't leave me."

1608
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:24,883
"Don't go."

1609
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:30,144
"You have just dwelled in my heart."

1610
01:15:30,566 --> 01:15:35,558
"You have just come in my dreams."

1611
01:15:35,635 --> 01:15:40,742
"You have just come in my arms."

1612
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:42,778
"Don't go."

1613
01:15:43,046 --> 01:15:45,350
"Don't go."

1614
01:15:45,427 --> 01:15:49,459
"Don't go."

1615
01:15:50,304 --> 01:15:55,181
"Don't go."

1616
01:15:55,411 --> 01:15:58,637
"Don't go."

1617
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:04,550
"Don't go."

1618
01:16:05,587 --> 01:16:09,888
"Don't go."

1619
01:16:10,886 --> 01:16:15,149
"Don't go."

1620
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,254
I am.. I am sorry.
- Why?

1621
01:16:22,061 --> 01:16:25,018
I spoke to you rudely.
- When?

1622
01:16:26,054 --> 01:16:31,162
When I told you to shoot me.
What was your mistake?

1623
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,885
Actually I am not like this.

1624
01:16:37,344 --> 01:16:40,186
If there hadn't been a problem,
I wouldn't have said it.

1625
01:16:41,299 --> 01:16:45,446
After papa's death,
I have become all alone.

1626
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:50,592
And I will have to
vacate this house too.

1627
01:16:51,552 --> 01:16:55,622
Do you know? That goon says that
if I didn't pay him the money..

1628
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:57,466
..then I will have to marry him!

1629
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,269
I will not marry that crazy guy.

1630
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:02,051
I will not marry him.

1631
01:17:03,648 --> 01:17:07,507
It will be better if I commit suicide.

1632
01:17:07,603 --> 01:17:11,405
I will kill you! If you
speak of committing suicide!

1633
01:17:12,134 --> 01:17:14,938
I am there! Here!
How much do you want?

1634
01:17:15,206 --> 01:17:16,704
I had brought 25,000 rupees!

1635
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:18,317
Only 25,000 rupees!

1636
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,080
Don't worry!

1637
01:17:23,731 --> 01:17:25,651
Take this chain!
It's worth 24,000 rupees!

1638
01:17:25,997 --> 01:17:27,110
That's it?

1639
01:17:27,571 --> 01:17:29,798
Meaning this is fake.

1640
01:17:30,566 --> 01:17:33,139
You can keep this ring.
It was for my namesake wife!

1641
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:34,368
Namesake wife?

1642
01:17:34,445 --> 01:17:37,056
Yes! I have just called
Meena my wife! - Is that so?

1643
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:38,170
It's worth 20,000 rupees!

1644
01:17:38,246 --> 01:17:41,280
I thought you will at
least give me a lakh. - What!

1645
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,621
You knew that I will give you money?
- Yes.

1646
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,653
O my God! Do I look like a fool?
- Fool?

1647
01:17:48,883 --> 01:17:51,763
Munna! Pappu! Take away everything!

1648
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,722
TV! Fridge! Sofa!
- Mr. Munde!

1649
01:17:53,952 --> 01:17:55,872
Washing machine!
- Mr. Munde!

1650
01:17:55,949 --> 01:17:57,485
Take away everything!
- No, no, please!

1651
01:17:57,562 --> 01:17:59,251
That too!

1652
01:17:59,328 --> 01:18:01,747
Please, Mr. Munde!
- M.M. Munde! Murli Manohar Munde!

1653
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:03,552
Neither less nor more! Bubblegum!
- No!

1654
01:18:03,629 --> 01:18:04,858
Take it! Please at
least take half of it!

1655
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:07,814
Look at her drama! A
bundle of note in her hand!

1656
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:10,157
Give it to me! Take
everything that this girl has!

1657
01:18:10,234 --> 01:18:11,347
Munde!

1658
01:18:14,419 --> 01:18:16,762
Come on! Leave the money!
And get lost!

1659
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:20,563
You will scare me with him?
- Yes!

1660
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,291
I won't let you stay here! You too!

1661
01:18:22,522 --> 01:18:23,616
Hang on, uncle!

1662
01:18:24,288 --> 01:18:26,246
You please put your
finger in your ears! - Why?

1663
01:18:26,323 --> 01:18:27,437
Do it! Do it!
- Why?

1664
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:29,088
Sit!
- Why?

1665
01:18:29,165 --> 01:18:30,240
Sit! Sit!

1666
01:18:30,547 --> 01:18:31,661
Now tell me!

1667
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:36,998
From today this girl is
your sister. Got it, Munde?

1668
01:18:37,344 --> 01:18:39,456
M.M. Munde! Murli Manohar Munde!

1669
01:18:39,533 --> 01:18:40,954
Neither less nor more! Bubblegum!

1670
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:43,027
Gun?

1671
01:18:44,294 --> 01:18:46,829
Give me the bubblegum.
- Take it.

1672
01:18:50,477 --> 01:18:55,123
Henceforth if you trouble her..
I won't spare you!

1673
01:18:56,352 --> 01:18:58,579
What are you saying?

1674
01:18:58,771 --> 01:19:02,458
Hey, listen! You foolish man!

1675
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:05,338
Listen to the threat completely!
What? - Yes!

1676
01:19:05,722 --> 01:19:08,410
If you ask money from
her or if you harass her..

1677
01:19:09,062 --> 01:19:11,405
..then I swear I
will shoot from Mumbai..

1678
01:19:11,482 --> 01:19:13,363
..and it will hit your back.

1679
01:19:14,938 --> 01:19:17,434
And like a buffalo stuck
in 26th July 2005 flood..

1680
01:19:17,472 --> 01:19:21,274
..you will be lying upside down dead!

1681
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:22,387
Got it?

1682
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,576
No, brother! No!

1683
01:19:25,152 --> 01:19:28,454
Jia is like my child. She is my child!

1684
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,797
Munna! Pappu! What are you doing?

1685
01:19:30,872 --> 01:19:32,563
You people come
whenever I call you! Leave!

1686
01:19:32,624 --> 01:19:34,736
Don't you have any work?
- Shut up! Done?

1687
01:19:35,059 --> 01:19:36,787
Come on! Touch her feet and leave!

1688
01:19:37,402 --> 01:19:38,822
Otherwise I will kill you!

1689
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,123
Sister! I love you!
Like brother and sister!

1690
01:19:43,354 --> 01:19:45,658
You don't worry. Your
brother is with you.

1691
01:19:45,734 --> 01:19:48,883
And you didn't tell me that you
know such a big don in Mumbai.

1692
01:19:49,152 --> 01:19:52,301
No problem. If you
need anything, call me.

1693
01:19:52,378 --> 01:19:54,374
Money! Bubblegum! Please!
- Get lost!

1694
01:19:54,451 --> 01:19:56,678
Yes! Let's leave!

1695
01:19:57,331 --> 01:20:01,094
Wow! You played the role of
an underworld don so well!

1696
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:02,822
Munde ran away in fright!

1697
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:04,781
But from where did you get this gun?

1698
01:20:05,011 --> 01:20:08,506
I am underworld's don!
Really I am a don!

1699
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,885
Are you really..

1700
01:20:14,688 --> 01:20:15,917
..a don?

1701
01:20:16,493 --> 01:20:20,678
Son! Son! Laxminarayan!
Laxminarayan is my father!

1702
01:20:20,794 --> 01:20:22,560
And I am his son! Okay!

1703
01:20:22,637 --> 01:20:25,133
Here there are father, son and uncle.

1704
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:26,938
Three types of Laxminarayan!

1705
01:20:27,014 --> 01:20:28,742
Now which one do you want, sir?

1706
01:20:28,819 --> 01:20:31,238
Can you take me to his room, sir?

1707
01:20:31,584 --> 01:20:34,080
God knows that after
Sonu's mother's death..

1708
01:20:34,502 --> 01:20:36,538
..I suppressed all my emotions!

1709
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:39,072
You again awakened it!

1710
01:20:41,107 --> 01:20:43,526
I call every woman my sister.

1711
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:46,613
Seeing the blouse size,
I tell them the size of the bra.

1712
01:20:46,637 --> 01:20:49,594
But I never cast
lustful eyes on anybody.

1713
01:20:49,747 --> 01:20:50,899
No! No!

1714
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:53,050
You have slandered me!

1715
01:20:53,702 --> 01:20:55,968
Who said to show this?

1716
01:20:56,237 --> 01:20:59,347
I sell underwear and vest.
What else will I see?

1717
01:20:59,846 --> 01:21:02,419
What! You said you deal in cars!

1718
01:21:02,688 --> 01:21:04,262
You deal in cars, right!

1719
01:21:04,339 --> 01:21:05,760
I do my business in car!

1720
01:21:06,451 --> 01:21:09,907
Is it wrong to sit in the car
and sell underwear and vest?

1721
01:21:10,445 --> 01:21:14,438
You said you will buy it
from me and sell it at 5%.

1722
01:21:14,822 --> 01:21:17,741
God! I was talking about the design..

1723
01:21:17,818 --> 01:21:19,546
..which you were
going to show me, ma'am!

1724
01:21:19,622 --> 01:21:21,158
Which design?
- This one!

1725
01:21:22,656 --> 01:21:24,000
This red design!

1726
01:21:24,077 --> 01:21:25,843
This is a photo of a car!

1727
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:30,989
So why are you showing your
innerwear standing like this?

1728
01:21:32,294 --> 01:21:34,560
It means you are not
that Laxminarayan..

1729
01:21:34,637 --> 01:21:35,866
..who was going to buy the car?

1730
01:21:35,942 --> 01:21:37,210
No!

1731
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:40,090
So you thought I was that person..

1732
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:41,587
..and you did this with me!

1733
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:42,931
What have you done!

1734
01:21:43,507 --> 01:21:45,811
If you are not that
Laxminarayan then where is he?

1735
01:21:45,888 --> 01:21:48,499
He must be somewhere! I am here!
- O God!

1736
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:51,072
Good afternoon!

1737
01:21:57,254 --> 01:21:59,213
Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir.

1738
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:01,939
Relaxing, sir?
- Yes, sir.

1739
01:22:02,131 --> 01:22:05,434
Sir, your son has come!
Sir, your father!

1740
01:22:06,086 --> 01:22:07,277
Hi, dad!

1741
01:22:08,467 --> 01:22:09,811
He is not my dad!

1742
01:22:09,888 --> 01:22:12,307
You tell him! Sir,
you are not his father!

1743
01:22:12,384 --> 01:22:15,226
When I am not married,
then how will I have a son?

1744
01:22:15,302 --> 01:22:17,069
And now I think I will never marry!

1745
01:22:19,219 --> 01:22:23,059
I understand, sir. Each person
has their own choice, sir!

1746
01:22:23,366 --> 01:22:27,552
Don't worry, sir.
We have another Laxminarayan!

1747
01:22:27,821 --> 01:22:28,934
I will show you that!

1748
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,432
Don't leave!
- Good night, sir!

1749
01:22:30,456 --> 01:22:32,141
Good night! Good night!
- Sorry to disturb you, sir!

1750
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,234
Not at all! Not at all! - Enjoy
yourself while you are here, sir!

1751
01:22:34,272 --> 01:22:35,462
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1752
01:22:38,842 --> 01:22:40,877
Marvelous acting. Marvelous!

1753
01:22:40,954 --> 01:22:43,526
D'mello sir! D'mello sir! D'mello sir!

1754
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:46,176
Sir, I told you that there is
another Laxminarayan in the hotel!

1755
01:22:46,445 --> 01:22:49,402
Now even the manager
said it! Will you let me go?

1756
01:22:49,478 --> 01:22:52,474
Shut up! My life is in danger!
And you want to leave!

1757
01:22:52,627 --> 01:22:54,662
Sir, please! Sir!
- Albert! Go! - Sir!

1758
01:22:56,045 --> 01:22:59,309
Ma'am, listen to me!
Now I touched you, it's over.

1759
01:22:59,923 --> 01:23:01,498
I mean whatever happened, it happened!

1760
01:23:02,112 --> 01:23:06,758
Listen to me!
- Don't touch me! You..

1761
01:23:07,488 --> 01:23:08,563
O no!

1762
01:23:09,869 --> 01:23:12,019
Now you will have to buy this car!

1763
01:23:12,518 --> 01:23:16,090
Its worth 10 lakhs!
You pay 9 lakhs! Okay!

1764
01:23:17,587 --> 01:23:22,349
9 lakhs! Ma'am, I look
like a fool! But I am not!

1765
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:23,654
Shut up!
- Why should I buy the car?

1766
01:23:23,731 --> 01:23:26,842
If I didn't pay the bank
installments within 5 days..

1767
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:28,301
..then they will seize my showroom..

1768
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,451
Because of this I..

1769
01:23:30,912 --> 01:23:32,986
Otherwise I am not
such kind of a girl!

1770
01:23:33,062 --> 01:23:35,827
I too am not that kind of a man!
You think I am Khurana!

1771
01:23:35,981 --> 01:23:39,091
I too have a reputation!
You can ask anybody at Chandni Chowk!

1772
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:40,627
Talking rubbish!

1773
01:23:41,126 --> 01:23:46,157
If my son came to know that in
a hotel room with a girl, I..

1774
01:23:46,579 --> 01:23:47,962
O God! O God! O God!

1775
01:23:54,182 --> 01:23:55,910
Ma'am, you hide in the bathroom.
- No!

1776
01:23:56,141 --> 01:23:57,638
Hide in the bathroom.
Somebody has come! - No!

1777
01:23:57,754 --> 01:24:00,326
Hide in the bathroom. Go there!

1778
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:02,323
Just lock the door from inside!
- But..

1779
01:24:03,782 --> 01:24:06,547
Hello, sir! Are you Laxminarayan?
- Yes!

1780
01:24:06,778 --> 01:24:08,736
Are you Sonu's father?
- Yes!

1781
01:24:10,733 --> 01:24:12,230
Hi, dad! What's up?

1782
01:24:20,294 --> 01:24:21,600
You returned so soon!

1783
01:24:21,624 --> 01:24:22,853
You were in Singapore, weren't you?

1784
01:24:23,098 --> 01:24:25,325
Actually dad, my work got
over soon. So I thought..

1785
01:24:25,402 --> 01:24:27,782
You thought that papa
doesn't know anything..

1786
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:30,125
..about bra, panties, design.

1787
01:24:30,202 --> 01:24:31,392
I will go and explain to him!

1788
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:33,389
Dad, please! Please call it lingerie!

1789
01:24:33,466 --> 01:24:34,886
Shut up! You fool!

1790
01:24:34,963 --> 01:24:36,038
I have been selling
underwear since the time..

1791
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,229
..you had not even
started wearing one!

1792
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:39,571
And you will explain to me! Leave!
- Leave? Why?

1793
01:24:39,648 --> 01:24:41,107
Hang on!
- Where are you going?

1794
01:24:41,568 --> 01:24:43,027
Dad, bathroom!
- Why?

1795
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,216
To use it!
- No!

1796
01:24:45,754 --> 01:24:47,405
Now I won't let you use it anymore!

1797
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:49,248
You have already reduced so much!

1798
01:24:49,325 --> 01:24:52,051
Don't you eat?
Now I won't let you reduce! No!

1799
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:53,933
Dad, please move!
Otherwise I will do it here!

1800
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:55,661
If you went in then
I will be trouble, son.

1801
01:24:55,738 --> 01:24:56,774
Please, dad!
- No!

1802
01:24:56,851 --> 01:24:58,310
Please, dad!
- No!

1803
01:24:58,387 --> 01:25:00,384
Please, dad!
- I said no!

1804
01:25:00,653 --> 01:25:03,034
Please, dad!
- No! No! No!

1805
01:25:05,952 --> 01:25:07,258
Dad, what is she doing here?

1806
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:09,677
Son, she is..

1807
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:12,557
You know my nature!

1808
01:25:13,325 --> 01:25:14,477
Now I know, dad!

1809
01:25:16,474 --> 01:25:17,510
Sorry, son.

1810
01:25:17,587 --> 01:25:21,504
Come on, Laxminarayan!
Now what to hide from your son?

1811
01:25:21,926 --> 01:25:27,034
Your dad was finalising a
deal with me in this room.

1812
01:25:28,032 --> 01:25:30,874
What deal?
- Shall I tell him, Laxminarayan?

1813
01:25:30,912 --> 01:25:32,064
No, I will tell him.
- I will tell him.

1814
01:25:32,141 --> 01:25:34,867
He is my son.
We normally talk. You leave. Fine.

1815
01:25:34,891 --> 01:25:37,810
Come on, Laxmi. You won't
get such a chance again.

1816
01:25:38,822 --> 01:25:43,008
Your dad, in this room,
sitting on this bed..

1817
01:25:43,853 --> 01:25:45,926
..finalised the car deal with me, right?

1818
01:25:47,194 --> 01:25:48,922
Car deal? When?
- Yeah!

1819
01:25:49,114 --> 01:25:52,339
Just now on this bed we both..

1820
01:25:53,146 --> 01:25:55,910
Shall I tell, Sonu?
- Yes! No! Why?

1821
01:25:56,486 --> 01:25:59,098
Your dad wanted to hide it from you.

1822
01:25:59,174 --> 01:26:02,438
Actually he has bought a
vintage car to sell his goods.

1823
01:26:02,554 --> 01:26:03,782
For 10 lakhs.

1824
01:26:03,936 --> 01:26:06,394
10 lakhs! - Yes. - Daddy, what is this?
We have a car!

1825
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:08,659
Cancel! Cancel this deal!
- The deal..

1826
01:26:08,736 --> 01:26:11,539
Laxmi, you said the deal is fixed.
The bed..

1827
01:26:11,616 --> 01:26:12,922
The deal is fixed!
- But, dad.

1828
01:26:13,037 --> 01:26:15,034
The deal is fixed!
- And my advance of 1 lakh!

1829
01:26:17,376 --> 01:26:19,834
I.. I can't believe this!

1830
01:26:20,486 --> 01:26:23,405
I am sitting in front
of an underworld don.

1831
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,051
Can I.. can I just please touch you?

1832
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:38,074
Oh thank God.

1833
01:26:40,992 --> 01:26:42,643
Oh, you are just so real.

1834
01:26:43,872 --> 01:26:46,829
Do you know? Why I started
working in undergarments?

1835
01:26:47,942 --> 01:26:50,285
Because like underworld,
this too has 'under' in it.

1836
01:26:51,014 --> 01:26:55,046
Underworld.
Undergarments. We are so similar.

1837
01:26:55,238 --> 01:26:57,274
I have got 1 lakh.
- No, dad.

1838
01:26:57,312 --> 01:27:00,230
Laxminarayan, thank you!
The car is yours.

1839
01:27:01,114 --> 01:27:03,034
I will leave. I have to make the agreement.

1840
01:27:03,072 --> 01:27:06,336
You come at 4 o'clock.
And bring the remaining 9 lakhs.

1841
01:27:06,413 --> 01:27:08,717
Okay.
- Okay! Okay!

1842
01:27:12,557 --> 01:27:17,088
Laxmi.. thank you. You saved me.

1843
01:27:18,586 --> 01:27:21,120
You put me into trouble.

1844
01:27:23,462 --> 01:27:27,571
I always wanted to
marry an underworld don.

1845
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:32,102
There is so much
excitement and thrill in their life.

1846
01:27:32,717 --> 01:27:33,907
Husband leaves in the morning.

1847
01:27:34,176 --> 01:27:35,597
And wife doesn't even know whether..

1848
01:27:35,674 --> 01:27:37,286
..her husband will come back or not.

1849
01:27:37,632 --> 01:27:40,051
When husband comes at
night and kisses her..

1850
01:27:40,243 --> 01:27:42,970
..it feels like the last kiss.

1851
01:27:43,162 --> 01:27:45,389
Because a bullet
might come from anywhere.

1852
01:27:45,696 --> 01:27:47,347
And the husband gets
killed in an encounter.

1853
01:27:48,077 --> 01:27:52,531
I just.. I just love this feeling.
I just love dons.

1854
01:27:54,298 --> 01:27:55,949
How many murders have you committed?

1855
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,944
You really didn't know that I am a don?

1856
01:27:59,712 --> 01:28:00,902
How could I have known?

1857
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:04,128
So why were you waiting
for me in the restaurant?

1858
01:28:04,973 --> 01:28:06,317
It's my restaurant.

1859
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:08,352
I received the message
that you are coming there.

1860
01:28:08,429 --> 01:28:10,042
So I came there with my bag.

1861
01:28:10,387 --> 01:28:13,267
Oh! So brother called you there..

1862
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:15,058
..and he sent me there to kill you!

1863
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:19,142
Your boss is a brother?
- Yes.

1864
01:28:19,757 --> 01:28:22,291
Do you know? This was my first murder!

1865
01:28:24,864 --> 01:28:26,131
For this extortion
money mother had offered..

1866
01:28:26,208 --> 01:28:27,552
..so many arecas in the temple.

1867
01:28:28,282 --> 01:28:30,394
Every Tuesday she would go
walking to Siddhivinayak temple..

1868
01:28:30,778 --> 01:28:33,274
So that her son gets one
chance of committing a murder.

1869
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,578
After worshipping so
many Lord Ganesha's..

1870
01:28:35,654 --> 01:28:37,114
..I got this chance!

1871
01:28:37,958 --> 01:28:40,877
I thought I will commit one
murder and settle down in life..

1872
01:28:41,222 --> 01:28:42,912
..then I will marry
Chhota Khujli's daughter..

1873
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,026
..and make my future bright.

1874
01:28:44,869 --> 01:28:48,825
But.. everything
messed up because of me.

1875
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:55,027
Kill me. Laxmi, kill me.

1876
01:28:55,185 --> 01:28:59,293
What are you saying?
You don't worry. I am there.

1877
01:29:00,614 --> 01:29:02,842
From today every bullet will
have to pass through me first..

1878
01:29:02,918 --> 01:29:03,994
..to reach to you.

1879
01:29:04,032 --> 01:29:07,142
What? - You will fight
with your boss for me?

1880
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,656
Now I will show brother
what I can do! - But you..

1881
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:13,632
I will leave now.

1882
01:29:14,016 --> 01:29:14,880
Laxmi!

1883
01:29:16,474 --> 01:29:19,430
Your namesake wife's ring.

1884
01:29:20,237 --> 01:29:21,427
Now is there any need for this?

1885
01:29:26,381 --> 01:29:28,646
I will return soon.
- I will wait for you!

1886
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:34,445
Yes! My sweetie pie, Laxmi.

1887
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:42,432
Brother Batlya! You and here!

1888
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:45,811
Dug grave and hidden
news are easily seen!

1889
01:29:47,539 --> 01:29:49,882
Is the work done?
- You were right, brother.

1890
01:29:50,496 --> 01:29:53,414
Flowers and ailment
don't last for long.

1891
01:29:54,259 --> 01:29:55,987
I am fine now, brother.

1892
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,982
Here are your goods. Your diamonds.

1893
01:29:59,674 --> 01:30:01,747
Diamonds! Diamonds!

1894
01:30:02,093 --> 01:30:04,090
Did you see? Did you see,
Chhota Khujli?

1895
01:30:04,282 --> 01:30:06,816
Didn't I say that Laxminarayan..

1896
01:30:06,893 --> 01:30:09,542
..will someday
fulfill his mother's dream?

1897
01:30:09,619 --> 01:30:12,499
I am proud of you!

1898
01:30:12,576 --> 01:30:15,341
How many bullets did you shoot?
- Not even one!

1899
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:21,024
I see! I see! I see! You
must have chopped and killed!

1900
01:30:21,677 --> 01:30:23,328
You must have strangulated and killed!

1901
01:30:24,058 --> 01:30:26,131
Your thinking is so small, brother!

1902
01:30:28,128 --> 01:30:29,894
Like lizard's egg.

1903
01:30:31,776 --> 01:30:34,656
Laying down life is
greater than taking life!

1904
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:36,461
Learn something!

1905
01:30:37,805 --> 01:30:40,070
I am not an ordinary brother like you!

1906
01:30:40,339 --> 01:30:43,334
To deal in diamonds
and for it kill somebody!

1907
01:30:45,792 --> 01:30:48,173
I thought you are a
level headed brother.

1908
01:30:48,763 --> 01:30:51,029
But now I found out that
your level is only one.

1909
01:30:51,053 --> 01:30:53,587
Did you kill the person?

1910
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:55,085
No!

1911
01:30:55,507 --> 01:30:58,579
Because I want to be a godfather!
Godfather!

1912
01:30:59,424 --> 01:31:01,498
Even this Chhota
Khujli can be a father!

1913
01:31:01,882 --> 01:31:04,378
But you become God when
you lay down your life!

1914
01:31:05,146 --> 01:31:07,411
And today I saved her life.

1915
01:31:08,064 --> 01:31:09,446
Here are your diamonds.

1916
01:31:09,869 --> 01:31:12,365
From today our paths are different.

1917
01:31:12,749 --> 01:31:16,627
Because I won't work for a
stupid and foolish brother like you!

1918
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:19,046
You slander
underworld's name for underwear.

1919
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,312
Check your diamonds.

1920
01:31:21,581 --> 01:31:23,424
And Chhota Khujli, get your daughter..

1921
01:31:23,501 --> 01:31:25,536
..Meena married to some other goon!

1922
01:31:25,882 --> 01:31:27,533
I am not interested in her!

1923
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:32,986
What is this?
- Diamond!

1924
01:31:35,904 --> 01:31:37,248
Is this diamond?-Yes!

1925
01:31:37,272 --> 01:31:39,384
Look! It's written here too!
Pure diamond! Look! Look!

1926
01:31:40,282 --> 01:31:41,357
Look!

1927
01:31:42,547 --> 01:31:44,659
Where will I wear this diamond?

1928
01:31:45,158 --> 01:31:47,578
It's your choice! Why do you ask me?

1929
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:49,152
Check it properly!

1930
01:31:49,459 --> 01:31:52,416
Laxminarayan doesn't
leave a job incomplete. What?

1931
01:31:52,493 --> 01:31:53,798
"One, two, three."

1932
01:31:53,944 --> 01:31:55,020
What? What are you looking at?

1933
01:31:55,219 --> 01:31:56,640
Say thank you! And give the payment!

1934
01:32:00,826 --> 01:32:01,978
Tell me something.

1935
01:32:03,398 --> 01:32:05,702
Is there a nice corner in this hotel?
- Why?

1936
01:32:05,779 --> 01:32:08,544
"One, two, three."
- Your payment is quite big.

1937
01:32:09,043 --> 01:32:10,925
If I paid you here, people will stare.

1938
01:32:12,154 --> 01:32:13,344
Yes, there is one,
brother! There is a corner!

1939
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:14,534
I will show it to you! Come! Come!
- Come!

1940
01:32:14,611 --> 01:32:15,648
Let's go, Chhota Khujli. Come.

1941
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:17,952
Hit him! Hit him! -Brother!

1942
01:32:18,029 --> 01:32:19,565
Why are you beating me, brother?

1943
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:22,138
Beat him! Hit him!
- Brother!

1944
01:32:22,867 --> 01:32:24,710
Fool! - If you don't want
to make any payment, fine!

1945
01:32:24,787 --> 01:32:26,170
But why are you beating me?

1946
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:28,781
I am a fool! I am stupid!

1947
01:32:29,088 --> 01:32:34,272
And.. and I will wear this!
I will wear this! I will wear this!

1948
01:32:34,886 --> 01:32:36,422
Tell me where the diamond is!

1949
01:32:36,499 --> 01:32:37,766
Here is your diamond!

1950
01:32:37,843 --> 01:32:38,957
The diamond which was snatched..

1951
01:32:39,072 --> 01:32:40,454
..from me and I lost my honour.

1952
01:32:40,531 --> 01:32:42,374
You can snatch this and
disgrace a person too, brother.

1953
01:32:43,334 --> 01:32:46,080
Diamond! Diamond which shines!

1954
01:32:46,214 --> 01:32:48,019
Brother, see this! It's shinning!

1955
01:32:48,096 --> 01:32:52,320
Hey! The diamond which Yadav stole!

1956
01:32:52,397 --> 01:32:53,741
Now who is this Yadav, brother?

1957
01:32:53,894 --> 01:32:56,506
Yadav! He! He is Yadav!

1958
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:59,846
Oh no, brother! I had come to kill her!

1959
01:32:59,923 --> 01:33:01,920
Who is she?
- She stole your diamond.

1960
01:33:01,997 --> 01:33:03,898
Yadav stole the diamond!

1961
01:33:03,994 --> 01:33:05,030
Then why did you send her photo?

1962
01:33:05,107 --> 01:33:08,218
I sent you his photo and not
her photo in the envelope!

1963
01:33:08,294 --> 01:33:10,061
Then why did I get her photo, brother?

1964
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:13,920
You are lying!
- You are lying!

1965
01:33:14,016 --> 01:33:17,011
You sent this photo, brother.
And you also sent diamond's photo!

1966
01:33:17,088 --> 01:33:18,701
And you are beating me too!

1967
01:33:18,778 --> 01:33:19,853
King Kong.

1968
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:22,042
Tell me! You didn't receive his photo?

1969
01:33:22,618 --> 01:33:24,192
No! Otherwise
I wouldn't have spared him.

1970
01:33:24,346 --> 01:33:26,112
I even thrashed him.
- When? Where?

1971
01:33:26,189 --> 01:33:28,646
He was running on the street!
- Now where is he?

1972
01:33:28,723 --> 01:33:29,760
Brother, I don't know.

1973
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:31,642
But the person whom he was
following he is in this hotel.

1974
01:33:31,718 --> 01:33:32,794
Come. Come. Show me.

1975
01:33:34,368 --> 01:33:36,749
Brother, why are you wearing goggles?
- What if he recognises me?

1976
01:33:37,286 --> 01:33:40,205
Brother, you really have it.
- What?

1977
01:33:40,474 --> 01:33:41,472
Goggles.

1978
01:33:43,392 --> 01:33:45,926
Mr. Davar! Laxminarayan here!

1979
01:33:46,157 --> 01:33:48,307
I need 9 lakhs.
- Dad..

1980
01:33:48,922 --> 01:33:49,805
9 lakhs!

1981
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:52,992
If there is a shortage of even a
penny, then the work won't be done.

1982
01:33:53,069 --> 01:33:56,102
Yes. And you know my nature. Got it?

1983
01:33:56,371 --> 01:33:57,792
I need 9 lakhs!

1984
01:34:00,058 --> 01:34:01,210
9 lakhs!

1985
01:34:01,286 --> 01:34:05,280
The price of killing papa
is 9 lakhs! Congratulations!

1986
01:34:05,357 --> 01:34:08,352
Isn't it too much, papa?
- Idiots!

1987
01:34:08,582 --> 01:34:12,384
Sir, now you are clear?
You have another Laxminarayan.

1988
01:34:12,461 --> 01:34:13,882
Now can I leave, sir?
- Not now!

1989
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:16,339
Where will you go? The
climax is still left!

1990
01:34:16,685 --> 01:34:19,411
Okay, papa!
- Look brother! He is that Yadav!

1991
01:34:20,294 --> 01:34:22,483
Where is he going? Where is he going?

1992
01:34:22,637 --> 01:34:23,904
Come on! Let's check!

1993
01:34:25,171 --> 01:34:26,477
O God!

1994
01:34:28,512 --> 01:34:32,045
Never before have
I seen such daring shooters!

1995
01:34:32,659 --> 01:34:34,771
I will kill him in such a
way that even death will say..

1996
01:34:35,117 --> 01:34:36,653
..what a death!

1997
01:34:36,806 --> 01:34:37,920
Wow! Albert!

1998
01:34:37,997 --> 01:34:39,149
Papa!
- Pinto!

1999
01:34:39,686 --> 01:34:43,373
Before Laxminarayan kills me.. shoot him!

2000
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:44,986
Come.
- You come!

2001
01:34:46,752 --> 01:34:48,019
How does..

2002
01:34:49,824 --> 01:34:51,821
How does he know that you want to kill him?

2003
01:34:52,013 --> 01:34:54,317
Brother, shall I kill him now?
- Hey!

2004
01:34:54,854 --> 01:34:57,734
You won't kill him.
Our paths are different.

2005
01:34:58,042 --> 01:34:59,923
Brother! Listen, brother!

2006
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:03,533
Brother! Brother! - Leave!
I am a cheap brother! - No, brother!

2007
01:35:03,686 --> 01:35:05,837
No, no, no! My thinking is
small like lizard's egg.

2008
01:35:05,914 --> 01:35:08,717
No, brother! My thinking
is small like lizard's egg.

2009
01:35:09,178 --> 01:35:11,328
Not just that I am
myself lizard's egg, brother.

2010
01:35:12,134 --> 01:35:14,669
You are very kind!
Give me one more chance!

2011
01:35:15,130 --> 01:35:17,549
Feelings for that
girl made me emotional.

2012
01:35:17,894 --> 01:35:22,541
My heart melted, brother.
One chance. Just one chance!

2013
01:35:23,347 --> 01:35:24,230
Stand up!

2014
01:35:25,843 --> 01:35:26,746
And remember!

2015
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:31,181
Beauty of youth and the urge
to urinate don't last for long!

2016
01:35:31,488 --> 01:35:34,291
Don't go after girls.
And concentrate on your career.

2017
01:35:35,443 --> 01:35:38,323
I give you another chance.
- Thank you, brother.

2018
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,667
But remember!
- Thank you.

2019
01:35:40,474 --> 01:35:44,160
If your bullet misses him,
then my bullet will kiss you!

2020
01:35:44,774 --> 01:35:48,346
Don't worry, brother. This
time I will aim his head! - Move!

2021
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,573
Pinto! Kill him!

2022
01:35:50,765 --> 01:35:54,182
No, sir! I beg of you,
sir! I beg of you!

2023
01:35:54,259 --> 01:35:55,642
I have still not got married.

2024
01:35:55,718 --> 01:35:57,562
A girl's family is
coming to see me next week.

2025
01:35:57,638 --> 01:35:59,174
Sir, please. Leave me!
-I will leave you!

2026
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,217
I'll let go of you.
First leave me! Leave!

2027
01:36:01,478 --> 01:36:03,667
Sorry, sir! Sorry, sir!
- "You fool."

2028
01:36:03,813 --> 01:36:04,965
On one condition!

2029
01:36:05,779 --> 01:36:08,390
What? I accept all your conditions!

2030
01:36:08,659 --> 01:36:11,578
We won't kill him!
- Very good, sir! Good! Good!

2031
01:36:11,654 --> 01:36:13,267
You will kill him!
- Very good!

2032
01:36:13,344 --> 01:36:14,880
No, sir! No! Don't do this!

2033
01:36:14,957 --> 01:36:18,643
Sir, I have never even killed a fly!
How will I kill a man, sir?

2034
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:22,445
Albert! Teach him how to kill a fly!

2035
01:36:22,522 --> 01:36:23,674
Papa!

2036
01:36:25,286 --> 01:36:30,086
Sir! Sir! Sir! You seem to
be an intelligent man, sir.

2037
01:36:31,507 --> 01:36:33,773
Genius, sir! You are so handsome, sir.

2038
01:36:33,965 --> 01:36:37,766
Leave me, sir. I hope you
understand my problem, sir.

2039
01:36:38,496 --> 01:36:40,800
Kill!
- What, sir?

2040
01:36:41,146 --> 01:36:43,488
A fly!
- Fly?

2041
01:36:48,096 --> 01:36:51,514
Lovingly. It's a female.
- Female.

2042
01:36:51,706 --> 01:36:52,973
It shouldn't hurt her.

2043
01:36:54,778 --> 01:36:55,853
Okay, sir!

2044
01:36:56,813 --> 01:36:58,541
The glass shouldn't break!

2045
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:01,152
The glass shouldn't break!
And I should kill the fly too!

2046
01:37:01,229 --> 01:37:04,282
How is that possible, sir!
You people have..

2047
01:37:05,338 --> 01:37:08,026
God is looking!
God will punish everybody!

2048
01:37:08,102 --> 01:37:09,331
Kill! Kill!

2049
01:37:10,214 --> 01:37:11,674
Kill! Otherwise I will beat you!

2050
01:37:12,173 --> 01:37:13,632
"Fools!"

2051
01:37:14,592 --> 01:37:18,125
Sir, she flew away! Sir!
- No! No!

2052
01:37:18,701 --> 01:37:20,390
Chandu! Do something!

2053
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:22,349
Otherwise the
diamonds worth 20 crores..

2054
01:37:22,426 --> 01:37:24,000
..will go with the car!

2055
01:37:24,461 --> 01:37:25,843
Now only God will do something!

2056
01:37:25,997 --> 01:37:29,798
God! God! God!

2057
01:37:30,067 --> 01:37:31,488
God! God, do something!

2058
01:37:31,565 --> 01:37:33,830
Lord Ganesh! What are
You looking at? Say something!

2059
01:37:33,907 --> 01:37:34,944
Excuse me!

2060
01:37:34,968 --> 01:37:36,043
You?
- You?

2061
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,091
You both and here!

2062
01:37:39,168 --> 01:37:40,704
You both should be ashamed!

2063
01:37:40,896 --> 01:37:43,814
You both hit that poor, innocent,
naïve, simple..

2064
01:37:43,968 --> 01:37:47,002
..loving Laxminarayan and ran away.

2065
01:37:47,078 --> 01:37:48,768
We are paying the
price of that mistake!

2066
01:37:48,845 --> 01:37:50,381
Actually we thought he
is that Laxminarayan..

2067
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:51,494
..who was going to
buy the car. -But ..

2068
01:37:51,571 --> 01:37:53,030
..he wasn't that Laxminarayan.

2069
01:37:53,222 --> 01:37:54,298
Which car?

2070
01:37:54,344 --> 01:37:55,688
There is a wrecked car, ma'am!

2071
01:37:55,834 --> 01:37:56,986
It didn't sell for 7 months.

2072
01:37:57,062 --> 01:37:59,251
It would have been so good if it
had not been sold for 2 days more!

2073
01:37:59,674 --> 01:38:01,133
Are you talking about 6121?

2074
01:38:01,248 --> 01:38:02,323
Yes!
- How do you know?

2075
01:38:03,245 --> 01:38:05,434
That wrecked, unlucky car is mine!

2076
01:38:05,626 --> 01:38:07,622
Please send your
bank executive tomorrow.

2077
01:38:08,237 --> 01:38:10,272
I will pay all the remaining EMIs.

2078
01:38:10,349 --> 01:38:11,424
20 crores!

2079
01:38:11,501 --> 01:38:13,267
Ma'am, even if you
give 75%, it will be fine.

2080
01:38:13,536 --> 01:38:16,800
Are you mad?
- 25%! Fine! Give 5%!

2081
01:38:17,146 --> 01:38:18,182
O no!

2082
01:38:19,603 --> 01:38:22,867
Oh! Hi, Jia!
- Hi, Laila!

2083
01:38:24,211 --> 01:38:26,208
No, no, no!
- Congrats!

2084
01:38:26,285 --> 01:38:29,549
Your car has been sold for 10 lakhs!
- Is that so?

2085
01:38:30,010 --> 01:38:31,200
The papers are ready!

2086
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:34,464
And Laxminarayan will
come at 4 with the payment.

2087
01:38:34,733 --> 01:38:36,936
Here is 50% of the advance!
- No, no!

2088
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,072
I don't need this now!
I have changed my mind!

2089
01:38:39,226 --> 01:38:40,416
I don't want to sell this car!

2090
01:38:40,685 --> 01:38:43,987
Are you joking? Here are
the car documents. Read it.

2091
01:38:44,602 --> 01:38:47,827
I don't want to sell this car!

2092
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:50,477
Okay!
- Do I look like a fool to you?

2093
01:38:50,707 --> 01:38:53,856
No! But I am taking this car!
- Over my dead body!

2094
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:57,427
This is my car!
- I made it a car! - Is that so?

2095
01:38:57,504 --> 01:38:59,194
I have spent money
on it! -What nonsense!

2096
01:38:59,232 --> 01:39:01,939
Look at this! I have
put up the headlights!

2097
01:39:01,997 --> 01:39:04,954
And this paint! I
got it painted! Got it?

2098
01:39:06,221 --> 01:39:07,565
And? And? And?

2099
01:39:07,642 --> 01:39:11,789
And what else? And! And!
Look at the tyres! So old!

2100
01:39:11,942 --> 01:39:15,014
I paid the money!
I got it changed! Look!

2101
01:39:15,706 --> 01:39:17,165
Open your eyes and see!

2102
01:39:18,278 --> 01:39:19,354
Hello!

2103
01:39:26,304 --> 01:39:28,070
Ma'am!
- Excuse me, ma'am.

2104
01:39:28,301 --> 01:39:30,643
With great toil you sold
this car. And she was refusing.

2105
01:39:30,874 --> 01:39:32,064
So Chandni made her unconscious.

2106
01:39:32,141 --> 01:39:33,600
Am I right, Chandni?
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

2107
01:39:33,677 --> 01:39:35,942
Well done! Very good!
- Wow! Good work, Chandni!

2108
01:39:37,747 --> 01:39:41,626
If you were hitting her, then
why were you standing behind me?

2109
01:39:44,851 --> 01:39:46,387
Ma'am!
- Ma'am, please!

2110
01:39:46,656 --> 01:39:48,538
Dad, please! Think once more!

2111
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:51,110
Even I am thinking
that we should leave soon.

2112
01:39:51,187 --> 01:39:52,493
We are getting late. Got it?

2113
01:39:53,837 --> 01:39:55,680
20 crores!

2114
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:57,907
Bring water! Ma'am is fainting!

2115
01:39:57,984 --> 01:39:59,942
Let her faint! Bring the car
and let's run away! - Okay!

2116
01:40:00,019 --> 01:40:01,248
Hey! Hello! Hello! Hello!

2117
01:40:01,325 --> 01:40:04,282
It's my diamond! Because
the car is in my showroom!

2118
01:40:04,474 --> 01:40:08,544
Excuse me. Diamond is mine.
Because the car is mine.

2119
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:11,040
But we found the diamond!
- So it's ours.

2120
01:40:11,232 --> 01:40:12,653
Yes!
- No, it is ours.

2121
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:13,882
How can she..

2122
01:40:18,298 --> 01:40:19,411
Quiet!

2123
01:40:20,678 --> 01:40:23,520
The diamond belongs to
all four of us! Okay!

2124
01:40:24,403 --> 01:40:25,478
Okay!
- Okay!

2125
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:28,512
But if Laxminarayan
came to buy the car then?

2126
01:40:28,858 --> 01:40:30,624
We will sell him the car!
- What! - What!

2127
01:40:30,701 --> 01:40:32,160
What!
- But we will remove..

2128
01:40:32,237 --> 01:40:33,466
..the diamonds before that!

2129
01:40:33,773 --> 01:40:36,230
You too! Dad, you never listen to me!

2130
01:40:36,307 --> 01:40:39,264
"The queen of my dreams,
when will you come?"

2131
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:41,376
Hello.
- Hello, Laxminarayan!

2132
01:40:41,453 --> 01:40:43,373
Laila here!
- Yes!

2133
01:40:43,603 --> 01:40:45,523
Can you come after an hour!

2134
01:40:46,483 --> 01:40:47,789
After an hour!

2135
01:40:47,866 --> 01:40:51,437
Actually it will take some
more time to get the papers ready.

2136
01:40:51,898 --> 01:40:54,893
Fine. You know my nature.
I will come after an hour.

2137
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:57,389
You are so sweet. Thank you so much.

2138
01:40:57,811 --> 01:40:59,117
Hurry up!

2139
01:40:59,561 --> 01:41:01,328
Here! You stopped me!

2140
01:41:01,766 --> 01:41:03,552
While going for an
auspicious deed, you shouldn't stop!

2141
01:41:03,686 --> 01:41:04,992
Fool!
- Okay! Okay!

2142
01:41:05,222 --> 01:41:06,374
Come on! Let's have coffee!

2143
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:08,294
Coffee? This in the room..

2144
01:41:08,371 --> 01:41:10,522
Where will you roam with this?
Let's keep it in the locker.

2145
01:41:10,752 --> 01:41:12,557
Will it be safe in the locker?
- Of course! Come!

2146
01:41:12,749 --> 01:41:13,709
Come! Fine!

2147
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:18,394
Hello, sir!
- Sir! Keep this bag safely!

2148
01:41:18,432 --> 01:41:19,853
I will return in an hour.

2149
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,427
No problem, sir.

2150
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,461
Laxminarayan! Room number!
- 504!

2151
01:41:25,114 --> 01:41:26,765
"One, two, three. One, two, three."

2152
01:41:26,842 --> 01:41:28,531
Right, sir?
- Yes! Carefully!

2153
01:41:32,141 --> 01:41:33,523
Plan has changed.

2154
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:35,827
It means now I don't
have to shoot him, right?

2155
01:41:35,942 --> 01:41:37,786
Thank you, sir.
- What's the hurry?

2156
01:41:37,862 --> 01:41:39,590
You will have to kill him.
- Sir, why?

2157
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:41,587
But using a bomb and not a gun.

2158
01:41:42,163 --> 01:41:46,464
Pinto, manufacture such
a bomb which explodes.

2159
01:41:47,194 --> 01:41:49,306
I am a diploma holder.
Am I right, papa?

2160
01:41:49,382 --> 01:41:54,298
Albert! Bring a bag similar to
the one he kept in the locker.

2161
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,371
We will fill that bag with bomb.

2162
01:41:57,562 --> 01:42:00,442
Then.. we will exchange it.

2163
01:42:01,632 --> 01:42:03,245
We will have 9 lakhs.

2164
01:42:03,706 --> 01:42:05,165
And he will have bomb.

2165
01:42:07,162 --> 01:42:09,850
He will press the remote.
- Me?

2166
01:42:10,963 --> 01:42:12,154
How can do it?
- Shut up.

2167
01:42:13,498 --> 01:42:15,571
He hit me.

2168
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:19,949
"One, two, three."
- He is a fool.

2169
01:42:20,371 --> 01:42:23,558
For that poor man's money,
he is killing him with a bomb.

2170
01:42:24,288 --> 01:42:27,206
Brother, he only took your goods.
Shall I kill him?

2171
01:42:27,283 --> 01:42:28,512
Wait! What are you doing?

2172
01:42:29,126 --> 01:42:30,586
We will kill him in his style!

2173
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:33,005
Meaning with a bomb?
- Yes!

2174
01:42:33,696 --> 01:42:36,422
And now we don't have to worry about..

2175
01:42:36,499 --> 01:42:38,150
..finding a similar bag.

2176
01:42:39,648 --> 01:42:41,606
Really, brother. You have it.

2177
01:42:43,142 --> 01:42:44,794
What?
- Brother, bag!

2178
01:42:45,754 --> 01:42:46,829
See this.

2179
01:42:46,906 --> 01:42:49,325
The bomb can explode if you touch it.

2180
01:42:49,632 --> 01:42:52,090
What shall I do?
- Keep it in this! Hurry up!

2181
01:42:52,512 --> 01:42:53,664
Fine, papa!

2182
01:42:55,354 --> 01:42:58,656
Now let me go! Let me go, papa!
- Papa!

2183
01:42:59,616 --> 01:43:01,766
He is calling you papa like us, papa!

2184
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:03,072
"You fools."

2185
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:04,262
Welcome to the family!
- Thank you!

2186
01:43:04,339 --> 01:43:06,221
Can I leave now?
- Papa, a photo!

2187
01:43:08,256 --> 01:43:09,792
"Fool!"

2188
01:43:10,829 --> 01:43:13,056
Correct, sir?
- 505! Thank you..

2189
01:43:14,170 --> 01:43:15,590
What are you doing, sir?
It will explode!

2190
01:43:15,667 --> 01:43:17,664
What, sir?
- Sir, bag!

2191
01:43:18,086 --> 01:43:19,584
Oh! Bag!
- New bag, sir!

2192
01:43:20,122 --> 01:43:21,811
Okay, sir! All right, sir!

2193
01:43:22,003 --> 01:43:24,614
Okay, sir! Sir, thank you! Sir,
thank you, very much!

2194
01:43:26,842 --> 01:43:28,800
Marvellous acting!

2195
01:43:36,787 --> 01:43:38,054
Good morning, sir!

2196
01:43:40,704 --> 01:43:43,046
You too have to keep the
bag for safe depositing, sir?

2197
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:45,600
How do you know?
- Albert! Pinto!

2198
01:43:45,696 --> 01:43:46,790
You both go and exchange the bags!

2199
01:43:47,078 --> 01:43:48,960
Papa, the entire hotel staff is here!

2200
01:43:49,037 --> 01:43:50,918
It's a serious work, Papa! You know.

2201
01:43:51,034 --> 01:43:52,262
Yes, so much tension.

2202
01:43:54,298 --> 01:43:55,315
Laxminarayan!

2203
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,560
Flirt with the girl
standing behind me.

2204
01:43:59,059 --> 01:44:00,134
Who! Me?

2205
01:44:00,288 --> 01:44:01,478
You! Who else!

2206
01:44:01,786 --> 01:44:04,973
Misbehave with her!
She will scream! Help! Help!

2207
01:44:05,357 --> 01:44:07,008
I will come and beat you!

2208
01:44:07,085 --> 01:44:09,312
All the hotel staff will gather here!

2209
01:44:09,734 --> 01:44:11,539
They both will go
and exchange the bags!

2210
01:44:11,808 --> 01:44:12,883
Simple!

2211
01:44:13,021 --> 01:44:15,633
Sir! Sir! Sir, I beg of you!

2212
01:44:16,224 --> 01:44:17,011
Papa!

2213
01:44:18,029 --> 01:44:21,600
Papa, my father! DM!
District Magistrate!

2214
01:44:21,677 --> 01:44:24,326
My great-grandfather.
Chief Justice! Bhatinda!

2215
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:27,413
Nobody in my family has
misbehaved with a girl.

2216
01:44:27,437 --> 01:44:28,627
You are telling me to do it?

2217
01:44:28,704 --> 01:44:30,432
I don't know how to
misbehave with a girl, papa.

2218
01:44:30,509 --> 01:44:31,699
What is there to do?

2219
01:44:32,544 --> 01:44:36,614
Go to her and say.. will you come.
She will get irritated.

2220
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:39,034
Go! How will you say it?

2221
01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:42,989
Will you come.. ma'am?

2222
01:44:43,066 --> 01:44:45,370
Ma'am! Is she your sister?
- No! No! No!

2223
01:44:45,792 --> 01:44:48,058
Will you come?
- "Fools!"

2224
01:44:48,403 --> 01:44:50,285
Will you come?
- You!

2225
01:44:50,362 --> 01:44:52,704
No, no! Which one? Which one?
- The one who is standing behind me!

2226
01:44:52,781 --> 01:44:54,163
I really don't remember.

2227
01:44:54,509 --> 01:44:57,696
Sir, left or right?
- Left!

2228
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,309
Sir, my left or your left?

2229
01:44:59,386 --> 01:45:01,805
Somebody make him quiet!
- Your left!

2230
01:45:01,882 --> 01:45:06,989
Sir! Sir! Sir, there
are two girls to my left!

2231
01:45:07,066 --> 01:45:08,256
"Fools!"

2232
01:45:08,333 --> 01:45:09,677
The one in pink dress.

2233
01:45:10,406 --> 01:45:12,864
"One, two, three." - Sir, there
are two girls wearing pink dress.

2234
01:45:12,941 --> 01:45:14,016
Light pink or dark pink?

2235
01:45:14,093 --> 01:45:15,706
Laxminarayan!
- No!

2236
01:45:15,898 --> 01:45:17,434
You do one thing!
- Yes, sir!

2237
01:45:17,856 --> 01:45:20,851
I will go and misbehave
with her! And you beat me!

2238
01:45:21,696 --> 01:45:26,650
My pleasure, sir! I mean..
I mean with my hand or leg, sir?

2239
01:45:27,034 --> 01:45:28,762
Leg!
- Left or right, sir?

2240
01:45:29,146 --> 01:45:30,643
You can beat me any way you want!

2241
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,141
You can beat me any way you want!

2242
01:45:32,218 --> 01:45:34,502
You beat me!
Otherwise I will kill you!

2243
01:45:36,173 --> 01:45:38,016
I.. I am going to misbehave with her.

2244
01:45:38,861 --> 01:45:40,128
Best of luck. Papa!
- From my side too..

2245
01:45:40,205 --> 01:45:41,242
Good luck! Best of luck!

2246
01:45:43,123 --> 01:45:46,349
"Everybody say!"
"Fool!" -You always ask..

2247
01:45:46,426 --> 01:45:47,654
..right or left!
- Sorry, sir!

2248
01:45:47,731 --> 01:45:48,998
Just enjoy life! Look!

2249
01:45:49,306 --> 01:45:52,608
"Fool!"
- Look how papa does it!

2250
01:45:54,989 --> 01:45:56,333
Will you come?

2251
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,792
"One, two, three."

2252
01:45:58,829 --> 01:46:00,288
My room or your room?

2253
01:46:01,901 --> 01:46:04,973
What?
- Listen! Come!

2254
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:07,238
Sorry! Sorry! Look, I am
not that kind of a man!

2255
01:46:07,354 --> 01:46:08,544
I am also not that kind of a woman.

2256
01:46:08,621 --> 01:46:10,694
Don't you have
father or brother at home?

2257
01:46:10,848 --> 01:46:13,306
Why are you acting smugly?
Look, it's off season!

2258
01:46:13,459 --> 01:46:15,149
I will give you a discount of 50%.
- Look, please!

2259
01:46:15,226 --> 01:46:16,723
A girl is flirting with papa!

2260
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,221
Come! Come!
- Help!

2261
01:46:18,298 --> 01:46:19,603
Come!
- Help!

2262
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,600
I will do whatever you say!
- Don't touch me! Please!

2263
01:46:21,677 --> 01:46:23,098
Come! Please!
- Beat me! -Excuse me!

2264
01:46:23,174 --> 01:46:24,749
Excuse me, guys! Try and understand!

2265
01:46:24,826 --> 01:46:26,016
I will take whatever you give me!

2266
01:46:26,093 --> 01:46:27,168
Don't touch me!
Everybody is watching! - Come!

2267
01:46:27,245 --> 01:46:29,126
Excuse me!
- Beat me!

2268
01:46:29,203 --> 01:46:31,930
Aren't you ashamed to tease a
woman who is like your mother?

2269
01:46:32,006 --> 01:46:33,926
No, no! He is not
misbehaving with me! - Beat me!

2270
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,232
Beat me! Hard!

2271
01:46:35,386 --> 01:46:36,998
What are you doing? He is
my customer! - Beat me hard!

2272
01:46:37,267 --> 01:46:38,573
Why don't you beat me?
- Leave!

2273
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:40,608
Don't touch me! Please! Hey, beat me.

2274
01:46:40,685 --> 01:46:41,760
Leave!

2275
01:46:42,797 --> 01:46:44,947
Leave him! What are you doing?

2276
01:46:45,523 --> 01:46:48,657
He is my customer! Leave him!
Why are you beating him!

2277
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:50,707
Leave him!
- Ladies and gentlemen!

2278
01:46:50,784 --> 01:46:53,664
Look at this!
- Hit him.

2279
01:46:53,741 --> 01:46:57,466
Come and see this!

2280
01:46:57,533 --> 01:47:01,152
He was teasing a woman!
He was teasing a woman!

2281
01:47:01,306 --> 01:47:04,646
He was teasing a woman!
- O my God!

2282
01:47:04,992 --> 01:47:06,451
Idiot!

2283
01:47:08,141 --> 01:47:12,019
I won't spare you!
You have harassed me!

2284
01:47:12,365 --> 01:47:13,786
Stupid man!

2285
01:47:13,862 --> 01:47:16,589
Why happened?
- Leave! Leave!

2286
01:47:16,666 --> 01:47:19,392
What are you doing? Leave!
What happened?

2287
01:47:19,469 --> 01:47:20,890
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

2288
01:47:20,966 --> 01:47:22,272
42!

2289
01:47:22,387 --> 01:47:23,539
Laxminarayan!

2290
01:47:23,962 --> 01:47:25,690
I think I am destined to kill him!

2291
01:47:25,766 --> 01:47:27,878
Stand straight! Stand straight
otherwise I will beat you more!

2292
01:47:29,184 --> 01:47:31,949
An unlucky man is being beaten!
- Amita, come!

2293
01:47:32,026 --> 01:47:34,483
Go and help!
- Go and see!

2294
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:35,866
Go!

2295
01:47:37,632 --> 01:47:38,861
The door!

2296
01:47:40,128 --> 01:47:42,317
I have hit him! Now call
the police! Call the police!

2297
01:47:42,432 --> 01:47:43,872
Call the police.

2298
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:47,078
No, no, no! Sir, please
don't do that! - Police!

2299
01:47:47,194 --> 01:47:48,230
Police!
- No police! Please, sir!

2300
01:47:48,307 --> 01:47:50,534
Sir, don't do that.
- Police! - My hotel is a very good..

2301
01:47:53,376 --> 01:47:54,566
"One, two, three."

2302
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,602
Police! Call the police!
- No.

2303
01:47:56,909 --> 01:48:00,134
You are right. No need to call
the police. The work is over!

2304
01:48:00,211 --> 01:48:01,286
No police! No police!
- The work is over!

2305
01:48:01,363 --> 01:48:03,283
Mummy, papa won't do this again!

2306
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:04,896
Papa, say sorry to mummy! Come on!

2307
01:48:04,973 --> 01:48:06,163
End the matter, sir.

2308
01:48:07,891 --> 01:48:08,966
Sorry!

2309
01:48:09,312 --> 01:48:11,078
You thrashed me badly!

2310
01:48:11,309 --> 01:48:13,114
He thrashed you so badly, papa.

2311
01:48:13,190 --> 01:48:14,688
Like a dog!

2312
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,106
You said to beat papa!
- But not so badly!

2313
01:48:20,794 --> 01:48:23,904
Please, let me go! You guys
got what you wanted. Please!

2314
01:48:23,928 --> 01:48:25,464
Papa, he too thrashed you.

2315
01:48:25,747 --> 01:48:28,051
He thrashed papa black and blue!

2316
01:48:28,128 --> 01:48:29,626
He is a dangerous man.

2317
01:48:29,933 --> 01:48:32,314
He even knows the
size of your underwear.

2318
01:48:32,352 --> 01:48:33,542
Papa!
- Papa!

2319
01:48:33,696 --> 01:48:35,270
That Laxminarayan is
running away with the bag!

2320
01:48:35,424 --> 01:48:37,267
Here you are, sir! Right, sir!

2321
01:48:37,738 --> 01:48:39,394
Hey! Hey!
- Where are you going?

2322
01:48:39,418 --> 01:48:40,646
You too get your bag!

2323
01:48:40,723 --> 01:48:42,758
I will press the remote from here.
The bomb will explode.

2324
01:48:42,782 --> 01:48:46,176
Not from here. Take him.
Take him from here. - Fool!

2325
01:48:46,445 --> 01:48:47,674
Come!
- Come on!

2326
01:48:49,171 --> 01:48:49,812
Come on!

2327
01:48:51,014 --> 01:48:53,472
"One, two, three."

2328
01:48:53,741 --> 01:48:54,854
"One, two, three."

2329
01:48:54,931 --> 01:48:56,006
Come on, boss.

2330
01:48:56,083 --> 01:48:57,926
"One, two, three. One, two, three."

2331
01:48:58,234 --> 01:49:00,384
"One, two, three. One, two, three."

2332
01:49:00,461 --> 01:49:02,304
"Coming in this world is free."

2333
01:49:02,381 --> 01:49:04,186
"Leaving the world is free."

2334
01:49:04,262 --> 01:49:05,837
Shall I press the button?
- Press the button.

2335
01:49:05,952 --> 01:49:07,334
Not now! Not now!
- "One two, three. One two, three."

2336
01:49:07,411 --> 01:49:08,563
Come on! Sit in the car!

2337
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,445
Papa.. - Come on! - Please
let me go! Get him in! Please

2338
01:49:14,554 --> 01:49:16,243
Press the button!
- Which one, papa?

2339
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,472
The left one.

2340
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:19,507
Now you can't even ask whose left.

2341
01:49:19,584 --> 01:49:21,658
Because left is the
same for all of us.

2342
01:49:22,886 --> 01:49:26,688
Aim at Yadav, Laxmi! And Khujli,
you aim at Laxmi!

2343
01:49:27,187 --> 01:49:28,608
Today, either he or he will die.

2344
01:49:29,261 --> 01:49:32,640
One! One.. two.. three.

2345
01:49:33,562 --> 01:49:34,867
One.. two.. three.

2346
01:49:34,944 --> 01:49:36,787
It didn't explode! It didn't explode!

2347
01:49:37,094 --> 01:49:39,590
Idiot! I think it's not in the range!

2348
01:49:39,667 --> 01:49:42,125
Albert! Take the car closer.

2349
01:49:42,470 --> 01:49:44,352
"It's like that. So heat it up!"

2350
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:45,946
"It's like that. Yeah!"

2351
01:49:46,042 --> 01:49:47,693
"It's like that. So heat it up!"

2352
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:49,651
Brother, I think they know
that we are following them!

2353
01:49:49,728 --> 01:49:50,803
They are increasing the speed!

2354
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,800
I will speed up the car! You aim!

2355
01:49:52,992 --> 01:49:54,413
1, 2, 3.

2356
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:56,179
"One two three." Drive faster!

2357
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:57,485
We are getting late!

2358
01:49:57,562 --> 01:49:58,829
Don't you know my nature!

2359
01:49:58,906 --> 01:50:00,250
Papa, it didn't explode!

2360
01:50:00,749 --> 01:50:02,592
Why doesn't it explode?

2361
01:50:02,861 --> 01:50:04,166
Drive closer!

2362
01:50:04,243 --> 01:50:06,086
Brother! Brother, he is in
my range. Shall I shoot?

2363
01:50:06,163 --> 01:50:08,698
Hang on! First we have to find
out where is the diamond. - Yes!

2364
01:50:08,774 --> 01:50:12,576
I will speed up. One, two, three..

2365
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:14,381
It didn't explode.
"It's like that. Yeah!"

2366
01:50:14,458 --> 01:50:15,763
"It's like that. So heat it up!"

2367
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,299
Papa!
- Yes! "It's like that. Yeah!"

2368
01:50:17,376 --> 01:50:19,104
The car in the rear wants to
overtake. Shall I let him do it?

2369
01:50:19,181 --> 01:50:21,101
Papa tell him if he
let's him overtake..

2370
01:50:21,178 --> 01:50:23,290
..our car will be in the middle
and we won't be in the range! Mad..

2371
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:24,826
I say crush him!

2372
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,245
"One, two, three. One, two, three."

2373
01:50:27,322 --> 01:50:30,432
"You are coming into this world fee"

2374
01:50:30,662 --> 01:50:32,429
"One, two, three. One, two, three."

2375
01:50:32,506 --> 01:50:34,656
One, two, three.

2376
01:50:37,843 --> 01:50:39,878
Laxminarayan, it's
your first murder! Shoot!

2377
01:50:42,912 --> 01:50:44,832
"You are coming into this world fee"

2378
01:50:44,909 --> 01:50:47,174
One, two, three.

2379
01:50:49,056 --> 01:50:51,206
For the sake of your mother, shoot!

2380
01:50:51,552 --> 01:50:54,202
"One, two, three. One, two, three."

2381
01:50:54,701 --> 01:50:55,968
It exploded! It exploded!

2382
01:50:56,352 --> 01:51:00,192
Papa! What could I do..
- Hey!

2383
01:51:07,488 --> 01:51:08,947
Papa, he is running away! Catch him..

2384
01:51:09,254 --> 01:51:10,330
No, papa!

2385
01:51:10,406 --> 01:51:11,674
I was going to take your permission.

2386
01:51:12,173 --> 01:51:13,478
May I take your leave please? Please.

2387
01:51:13,594 --> 01:51:17,510
No! You can't leave until
he doesn't die! Follow him!

2388
01:51:19,814 --> 01:51:23,194
You miss still water
and dead grandma a lot.

2389
01:51:23,232 --> 01:51:25,114
Yes, brother! -Why are
you looking at my face?

2390
01:51:25,152 --> 01:51:27,341
We shouldn't spare Yadav! Come on!
- Where, brother?

2391
01:51:30,682 --> 01:51:32,026
Dad! Dad, listen! Listen!

2392
01:51:32,525 --> 01:51:34,483
Dad, she is fooling you!

2393
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,398
Son, you too be fooled. Its great fun!

2394
01:51:40,474 --> 01:51:41,510
Laila!

2395
01:51:42,893 --> 01:51:45,312
Laxminarayan, you have come!
Come! Please come!

2396
01:51:45,389 --> 01:51:46,656
Please come!
- Here!

2397
01:51:46,963 --> 01:51:48,538
So nice to see you!
- Its 9 lakhs!

2398
01:51:49,267 --> 01:51:51,379
Here.
- Thank you! - And where is my car?

2399
01:51:51,648 --> 01:51:53,952
Polishing is going on!
You guys hurry up!

2400
01:51:54,029 --> 01:51:55,450
Laxminarayan has come!

2401
01:51:55,603 --> 01:51:57,485
And its cash. Count it. Fine?
Count it. - Okay.

2402
01:51:57,562 --> 01:51:58,790
Yes..
- Count it properly.

2403
01:52:01,594 --> 01:52:04,320
What is this?
- I got bundles of 10s. What to do?

2404
01:52:05,011 --> 01:52:06,240
Is this bundle of 10s?

2405
01:52:06,317 --> 01:52:09,043
This is panty!
She calls panty a bundle!

2406
01:52:09,811 --> 01:52:10,925
This is panty!

2407
01:52:11,194 --> 01:52:14,050
Panty! I had put the bundle in this!
- How did the panties come here?

2408
01:52:14,074 --> 01:52:16,723
These are my designs!
How did you get it?

2409
01:52:17,722 --> 01:52:18,816
Hi, Jia!

2410
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:22,906
You! How dare you come in front of me!

2411
01:52:22,982 --> 01:52:26,746
You told Laxminarayan to
take my samples and to kill me!

2412
01:52:26,861 --> 01:52:28,742
Wait and watch. I'll kill you.

2413
01:52:29,126 --> 01:52:30,547
Dad, is this what you told her?

2414
01:52:31,008 --> 01:52:32,467
First tell me who is she?

2415
01:52:32,544 --> 01:52:34,925
Dad, she is Jia. You
had come for her designs.

2416
01:52:35,117 --> 01:52:36,922
I didn't even meet her. Greetings.

2417
01:52:36,998 --> 01:52:38,611
Greetings. Who is he?

2418
01:52:38,688 --> 01:52:41,146
I am Laxminarayan.
Underwear and vest seller.

2419
01:52:42,528 --> 01:52:43,680
So who was he?

2420
01:52:43,872 --> 01:52:46,253
Hang on! Hang on! Who was who?
- I..

2421
01:52:46,714 --> 01:52:48,672
Dad, what's the matter?
You didn't meet her?

2422
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:51,398
You gave me this
photo in the envelope.

2423
01:52:51,514 --> 01:52:53,050
So how could I have met her?
- And this was..

2424
01:52:53,126 --> 01:52:54,586
..for the other Laxminarayan.

2425
01:52:55,085 --> 01:52:58,426
Who is this other Laxminarayan?

2426
01:52:58,502 --> 01:52:59,654
There! There is Laxminarayan!

2427
01:52:59,731 --> 01:53:01,421
What kind of project have I accepted!

2428
01:53:01,613 --> 01:53:02,803
You have made me a dog!

2429
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,070
Press the button!

2430
01:53:05,069 --> 01:53:06,144
Hey!

2431
01:53:09,754 --> 01:53:11,443
What kind of bomb
have you manufactured!

2432
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,133
It doesn't explode!
- Laxmi..

2433
01:53:13,210 --> 01:53:14,976
..I have a diploma.

2434
01:53:15,053 --> 01:53:16,934
From where did you get the diploma?

2435
01:53:17,011 --> 01:53:19,277
Papa, we will go in
front of him and press it!

2436
01:53:19,392 --> 01:53:21,926
Some things don't work from behind!

2437
01:53:22,003 --> 01:53:24,000
I had come to buy
panties and I got a car.

2438
01:53:24,230 --> 01:53:27,264
That Laxminarayan
had come to buy a car.

2439
01:53:27,917 --> 01:53:29,030
And he will get panties.

2440
01:53:29,222 --> 01:53:30,605
This is the same car
which I wanted to buy!

2441
01:53:30,682 --> 01:53:31,872
Right said, Mr. Laxminarayan

2442
01:53:32,064 --> 01:53:33,792
O my God!
- Not that Laxminarayan!

2443
01:53:33,869 --> 01:53:35,405
God knows where he will be!

2444
01:53:36,058 --> 01:53:38,054
Excuse me, ma'am! Hey! Hey! Hey!

2445
01:53:38,131 --> 01:53:39,398
Excuse me, ma'am!

2446
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:41,779
Excuse me, ma'am! Excuse me, sir?

2447
01:53:41,856 --> 01:53:43,853
Can I come in? Can I come in?

2448
01:53:44,698 --> 01:53:45,965
Can I say something, ma'am?
- Sure.

2449
01:53:46,042 --> 01:53:49,152
Sir! Ma'am, I am the
other Laxminarayan! I..

2450
01:53:49,382 --> 01:53:52,186
Hey! He was in the room next to mine!

2451
01:53:52,262 --> 01:53:53,606
He was the one!
- Right, sir!

2452
01:53:53,683 --> 01:53:55,834
Ma'am, I had come to buy
the car for Mr. Pipat!

2453
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:58,214
Oh yeah! Mr. Pipat had called me!

2454
01:53:58,291 --> 01:53:59,866
Right, man! I am his man!
- Oh!

2455
01:53:59,942 --> 01:54:01,594
Pipat's man!
- Right, sir!

2456
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:02,938
Tell me something.
- Yes, sir!

2457
01:54:03,014 --> 01:54:04,474
Your Pipat..
- Yes, sir.

2458
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:07,430
He doesn't have a wife?
- No, no, sir! He has two wives

2459
01:54:07,776 --> 01:54:09,888
Come on, dad!
- Two wives? - Right, sir!

2460
01:54:10,118 --> 01:54:12,960
And he has kept a man too!
What kind of man is he!

2461
01:54:13,882 --> 01:54:15,302
Let's go there! Come on!

2462
01:54:15,533 --> 01:54:18,374
Take this! Take your photo!
I got it by mistake. Keep it!

2463
01:54:18,451 --> 01:54:20,909
And yes, sir! Sir, your photo!
You had come to kill him, sir.

2464
01:54:22,176 --> 01:54:23,712
One, two..

2465
01:54:24,019 --> 01:54:25,440
Why doesn't it explode?

2466
01:54:25,632 --> 01:54:27,629
Sir, you are a sharp shooter.

2467
01:54:27,782 --> 01:54:29,933
Sharp shooter. - Sharp shooter?
- No. I sell underwear.

2468
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:31,354
You didn't come to kill him?

2469
01:54:31,546 --> 01:54:32,890
Then who had come to kill him?

2470
01:54:33,658 --> 01:54:35,962
Third Laxminarayan! He came to me!

2471
01:54:37,728 --> 01:54:39,994
Brother, there!
There! Stop! Stop! Stop!

2472
01:54:40,762 --> 01:54:41,952
Pinto, press it!

2473
01:54:42,029 --> 01:54:43,066
No, no, no! Papa!

2474
01:54:43,142 --> 01:54:45,101
Please! Please!
Don't press the remote! Please!

2475
01:54:45,214 --> 01:54:46,406
Why?

2476
01:54:47,021 --> 01:54:48,787
He is your papa? Greetings!

2477
01:54:48,902 --> 01:54:50,323
No, no, no! He is not my papa!

2478
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,782
Everybody calls him papa.

2479
01:54:51,859 --> 01:54:53,280
So I also call him papa.
- Everybody's papa!

2480
01:54:53,357 --> 01:54:54,509
D'mello Yadav! Gangster!

2481
01:54:54,586 --> 01:54:56,160
"Everybody say." "Fools."

2482
01:54:56,582 --> 01:54:58,656
Nobody move! -"Fools."

2483
01:54:58,925 --> 01:55:00,192
Otherwise I will shoot!

2484
01:55:00,461 --> 01:55:01,651
O my God!

2485
01:55:02,419 --> 01:55:04,301
Take whatever they have! Come on!

2486
01:55:04,378 --> 01:55:05,414
Laxminarayan!

2487
01:55:06,182 --> 01:55:07,910
You had come to kill me?
- O my God!

2488
01:55:08,179 --> 01:55:09,562
D'mello Yadav!

2489
01:55:09,754 --> 01:55:11,597
"One, two, three. One, two, three."

2490
01:55:11,942 --> 01:55:13,632
Ones..
- No, papa! No, papa!

2491
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:15,706
Papa, don't press the remote.
It will explode, papa!

2492
01:55:15,782 --> 01:55:17,510
Please, papa!
- Hang on!

2493
01:55:17,587 --> 01:55:18,662
Please
- Where is the bomb?

2494
01:55:18,739 --> 01:55:20,506
Sir! Sir, in your bag!

2495
01:55:20,774 --> 01:55:21,965
One. Two. Three..

2496
01:55:22,656 --> 01:55:24,269
There is a bomb in my bag?

2497
01:55:25,152 --> 01:55:27,034
There is a bomb in my bag?
- Yes!

2498
01:55:27,878 --> 01:55:28,992
Is this a bomb?

2499
01:55:31,027 --> 01:55:32,563
This is the cover of the bomb.

2500
01:55:33,178 --> 01:55:34,330
Then where is the bomb?

2501
01:55:34,752 --> 01:55:36,480
The bomb is in your bag,
D'mello Yadav!

2502
01:55:36,557 --> 01:55:38,323
You? Who are you?

2503
01:55:38,938 --> 01:55:40,858
Laxminarayan!
- The third one!

2504
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,317
Orange is never hard.

2505
01:55:42,432 --> 01:55:44,467
And Batlya's enemy
never has enough time.

2506
01:55:44,659 --> 01:55:45,773
Hey! Hey!

2507
01:55:46,694 --> 01:55:49,596
Your bomb will kill you.
Give the remote.

2508
01:55:49,766 --> 01:55:50,918
Papa, don't listen to him.

2509
01:55:51,034 --> 01:55:53,030
We had changed the tag of
the bag. Pinto, show it!

2510
01:55:53,107 --> 01:55:54,259
I had changed it!

2511
01:55:54,336 --> 01:56:00,134
Papa! Papa, I had myself
changed the tag of the left bag..

2512
01:56:00,211 --> 01:56:01,402
..with the right one.

2513
01:56:01,478 --> 01:56:04,358
And I had changed the tag of
the left bag with the right one.

2514
01:56:05,088 --> 01:56:08,928
I don't understand!

2515
01:56:09,389 --> 01:56:10,694
Can I say something? Can I..

2516
01:56:11,002 --> 01:56:13,229
Okay! Can I say something?
Please! Okay!

2517
01:56:13,382 --> 01:56:15,264
Please! Please! You guys
drop the guns! Please!

2518
01:56:15,341 --> 01:56:17,491
Thank you, guys. Now you
listen to me carefully. Okay!

2519
01:56:17,568 --> 01:56:18,797
Excuse me! Get me the table please!

2520
01:56:18,874 --> 01:56:20,179
The left one. Get me..

2521
01:56:20,256 --> 01:56:22,906
.. the right one. Thank you very much.

2522
01:56:22,982 --> 01:56:25,402
Now tell me who changed the tag first?

2523
01:56:25,478 --> 01:56:27,590
I did it! I did it!
- How did you change it? Show it.

2524
01:56:27,667 --> 01:56:30,470
I changed the tag of the
left bag with the right one!

2525
01:56:30,547 --> 01:56:34,387
I see! When you did it then the
left was your left or my left?

2526
01:56:35,578 --> 01:56:37,613
My, It was my left.

2527
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:39,917
Then I shifted the
left one to the centre.

2528
01:56:40,147 --> 01:56:41,914
And I changed the right
one with the left one.

2529
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:44,371
That's it. Simple. One, two, three.

2530
01:56:44,448 --> 01:56:46,291
BBC. Bomb. Bra. Cash.

2531
01:56:46,368 --> 01:56:47,750
"One, two, three. One, two, three."

2532
01:56:47,827 --> 01:56:49,709
Then one two was made two one.

2533
01:56:49,862 --> 01:56:51,898
Then again one two was made two one.

2534
01:56:51,974 --> 01:56:53,702
And one was exchanged with three.

2535
01:56:53,779 --> 01:56:56,736
One, two, three.
Absolutely clear and simple.

2536
01:56:56,813 --> 01:56:57,850
You guys get it?

2537
01:56:58,042 --> 01:57:01,843
No? You.. One.. two.. three.

2538
01:57:02,726 --> 01:57:03,763
No?

2539
01:57:04,224 --> 01:57:05,760
You understood?

2540
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:09,331
No, no, no.. I say press the remote.

2541
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,982
The one which will explode,
it has the bomb.

2542
01:57:11,174 --> 01:57:13,018
Sir, I think this is the best idea..
- Wonderful..

2543
01:57:13,094 --> 01:57:15,437
..considering that you
guys are.. -Papa press it.

2544
01:57:15,706 --> 01:57:18,163
One.. two.. three.

2545
01:57:21,619 --> 01:57:23,616
You are slandering me since morning.

2546
01:57:24,614 --> 01:57:26,842
Is there a bomb? Or he
is just pressing it.

2547
01:57:27,187 --> 01:57:29,760
No, sir. There is a bomb.
I myself saw it.

2548
01:57:29,952 --> 01:57:31,872
But it doesn't explode.
He has manufactured it.

2549
01:57:33,062 --> 01:57:34,906
Hold this. Show me the remote.

2550
01:57:35,136 --> 01:57:36,634
One.. two.. three.

2551
01:57:37,094 --> 01:57:38,976
The plus and minus
signs are interchanged.

2552
01:57:39,053 --> 01:57:41,357
How will it explode?
It should be the other way round?

2553
01:57:41,549 --> 01:57:48,269
Make minus as plus. And put
the cap. And say one, two, three.

2554
01:57:48,346 --> 01:57:50,227
It exploded, papa?

2555
01:57:50,419 --> 01:57:52,262
It didn't explode! It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!

2556
01:57:52,339 --> 01:57:53,683
It didn't explode!

2557
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,410
Since morning you have
been humiliating me!

2558
01:57:56,486 --> 01:57:57,638
You humiliated me in the car!

2559
01:57:57,754 --> 01:57:59,059
You've humiliated me a lot.

2560
01:57:59,136 --> 01:58:02,746
You humiliated me in front
of these girls! I will..

2561
01:58:02,822 --> 01:58:07,200
Hey! Rangeela's Jackie Shroff! Quiet!

2562
01:58:08,736 --> 01:58:11,309
You are beating me
in front of everybody.

2563
01:58:12,552 --> 01:58:14,549
What can I do if the
battery is not functioning!

2564
01:58:14,573 --> 01:58:17,069
Right! Right! Isn't it
better to open the bag and check?

2565
01:58:17,146 --> 01:58:18,758
Right!
- No!

2566
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:20,371
Now it's not about the bomb exploding!

2567
01:58:20,448 --> 01:58:22,714
It's about my honour!

2568
01:58:22,867 --> 01:58:24,518
Now until the bomb doesn't explode..

2569
01:58:24,634 --> 01:58:26,131
..give me the gun!

2570
01:58:26,208 --> 01:58:28,550
Hey!
- Give me the gun! Give me the gun!

2571
01:58:28,627 --> 01:58:30,509
Otherwise I will shoot!
Give me the gun! - Give the gun!

2572
01:58:30,586 --> 01:58:31,891
Otherwise he will shoot himself!

2573
01:58:31,968 --> 01:58:33,043
Please! Give the gun!
- Quiet!

2574
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,272
You don't say anything!

2575
01:58:34,349 --> 01:58:36,307
I will explode you
before the bomb explodes!

2576
01:58:36,499 --> 01:58:38,534
Albert, come here!
- Fine..

2577
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:40,147
I am normal with you!

2578
01:58:40,723 --> 01:58:43,565
Go and buy two
batteries from the shop. Go.

2579
01:58:43,642 --> 01:58:45,792
I don't have change.
- Change!

2580
01:58:45,984 --> 01:58:48,864
I will give you. But
bring it quickly. Go. Go.

2581
01:58:48,941 --> 01:58:49,978
Thanks.

2582
01:58:50,438 --> 01:58:51,629
Pinto! Pinto!

2583
01:58:51,706 --> 01:58:55,008
Why do you harp Pinto the whole day?

2584
01:58:55,392 --> 01:58:56,698
You pronounce it improperly!

2585
01:58:57,581 --> 01:59:00,422
He always add 'S'
after an English word.

2586
01:59:00,614 --> 01:59:02,573
He makes us say fathers.

2587
01:59:03,072 --> 01:59:04,992
People have one father in the world.

2588
01:59:05,069 --> 01:59:07,872
And we have 5.5 lakhs fathers.
- Right!

2589
01:59:08,102 --> 01:59:09,830
Papa, you shouldn't do that! -Yes!

2590
01:59:09,907 --> 01:59:12,288
Hey! I will thrash you!

2591
01:59:12,442 --> 01:59:14,822
Papa adds S. But why
are you interfering?

2592
01:59:14,899 --> 01:59:17,165
I will thrash you. He is a fool..

2593
01:59:17,242 --> 01:59:19,738
Pinto! I brought you from the street!

2594
01:59:20,582 --> 01:59:24,614
From the orphanage! I gave
him clothes! I gave it to him!

2595
01:59:25,382 --> 01:59:29,376
So did I give an application?
To adopt me?

2596
01:59:29,914 --> 01:59:33,677
Father dies in darkness
and the son in a powerhouse.

2597
01:59:34,368 --> 01:59:39,206
Here are your clothes. Dramatic man!
- Pinto!

2598
01:59:39,437 --> 01:59:42,394
You always beat me in
front of others. - Pinto!

2599
01:59:43,392 --> 01:59:45,850
You always beat me in
front of others. - Pinto!

2600
01:59:45,926 --> 01:59:47,194
What happened?
- Listen to me!

2601
01:59:47,232 --> 01:59:48,115
Yes!
- Listen!

2602
01:59:50,957 --> 01:59:53,722
Did you buy it from Pahadganj?
- Yes.

2603
01:59:54,067 --> 01:59:56,064
Its Khurana's goods.
- How did you know?

2604
01:59:56,141 --> 01:59:57,792
Only Khurana sells such cheap stuff.

2605
02:00:04,205 --> 02:00:05,357
Do you know?

2606
02:00:05,472 --> 02:00:09,427
Saying Calvin Klein,
he gives us Khurana's goods.

2607
02:00:09,504 --> 02:00:10,810
He is a miser!

2608
02:00:10,886 --> 02:00:12,384
Calvin Klein doesn't
make such underwear..

2609
02:00:12,461 --> 02:00:14,074
How could you say that? - You look good.
Ma'am, I am telling you.

2610
02:00:14,304 --> 02:00:16,224
Don't say it in public.
- This man!

2611
02:00:17,299 --> 02:00:19,411
Kills by giving electric shock.

2612
02:00:19,603 --> 02:00:23,098
During power cuts he
kills by using the generator.

2613
02:00:23,866 --> 02:00:25,478
You don't cry. Ask him.

2614
02:00:25,670 --> 02:00:27,398
Shall I tell him
what happened on Sunday?

2615
02:00:27,667 --> 02:00:29,434
This Sunday or previous Sunday?

2616
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:31,469
Fool! You!
- Sorry!

2617
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:33,158
Sorry! Say it clearly!

2618
02:00:33,274 --> 02:00:35,578
Pinto! Pinto! Don't get angry!
Don't get angry!

2619
02:00:35,654 --> 02:00:37,114
Batlya brother, you don't interfere.

2620
02:00:37,190 --> 02:00:39,610
Look, you are like my younger son.

2621
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,107
Yes. That's why I am telling you.

2622
02:00:41,261 --> 02:00:43,642
Who killed your Hiralal? We did it.

2623
02:00:43,718 --> 02:00:48,134
Now where did
Hiralal hide the jewellery?

2624
02:00:48,326 --> 02:00:51,206
We don't know! Tell me!

2625
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,202
You know something.
Memory has become weak!

2626
02:00:54,432 --> 02:00:57,850
Which diamond? What diamond? What car?

2627
02:00:57,926 --> 02:00:59,462
One, two, three.
- This was the one!

2628
02:00:59,539 --> 02:01:01,152
"One, two, three. One, two, three."

2629
02:01:01,229 --> 02:01:04,301
Papa, they both are the one!

2630
02:01:05,491 --> 02:01:07,949
Tell me! Where is the diamond?

2631
02:01:08,102 --> 02:01:09,139
I don't know!

2632
02:01:09,216 --> 02:01:10,790
Very good, Chandu! Don't tell him!

2633
02:01:10,867 --> 02:01:13,171
Even if you have to lay down
your life! Don't tell him!

2634
02:01:13,248 --> 02:01:17,088
Okay! Chandu! Where is the diamond?

2635
02:01:17,165 --> 02:01:18,278
Stop it! What are you doing?

2636
02:01:18,394 --> 02:01:19,814
Tell him that it's in the petrol tank!

2637
02:01:19,891 --> 02:01:21,043
Petrol tank!

2638
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:22,886
It's my diamond!
- It's my diamond!

2639
02:01:22,963 --> 02:01:24,346
I have bought the car! Its mine!

2640
02:01:24,422 --> 02:01:25,920
I had come for the diamonds!
- it is mine. - It's mine!

2641
02:01:25,997 --> 02:01:29,990
I have the gun! So the
diamond is mine, papa!

2642
02:01:30,067 --> 02:01:32,717
But petrol tank is not opening.
How to get the diamond?

2643
02:01:33,446 --> 02:01:35,981
"One, two, three." Then..
Heave! Everybody heave!

2644
02:01:37,901 --> 02:01:41,165
What are you doing? - Vomiting!
- Vomiting! - Vomiting! - Vomiting!

2645
02:01:41,587 --> 02:01:44,506
I said to turn the car!
- Oh!

2646
02:01:44,582 --> 02:01:46,003
Which one? This one or that one?

2647
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,770
His questions and answers!

2648
02:01:51,149 --> 02:01:52,838
What do want?
- Give me two batteries.

2649
02:01:52,954 --> 02:01:55,027
Which one? Big, medium, small?
- For remote!

2650
02:01:55,104 --> 02:01:57,485
Which remote? VCG, DVD or TV.

2651
02:01:57,562 --> 02:01:59,098
For the remote of a bomb.

2652
02:01:59,482 --> 02:02:01,286
Fatehchand.
- Yes, ma'am.

2653
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,590
Did you hear what I heard?
- Ma'am!

2654
02:02:04,205 --> 02:02:06,778
Guys! Guys! Guys! Hold it up!
Hold it up! Hold it up!

2655
02:02:06,854 --> 02:02:07,891
Up! Up! Up!

2656
02:02:07,968 --> 02:02:11,462
Your right! Your right!
Not my right! Here! Here!

2657
02:02:11,846 --> 02:02:13,997
"One, two, three! One, two, three!"

2658
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:15,994
"Coming into the world is free!"

2659
02:02:16,224 --> 02:02:18,067
"Leaving the world is free."

2660
02:02:18,336 --> 02:02:20,410
"Look at this charade of the world."

2661
02:02:20,486 --> 02:02:22,714
"Absolutely free."

2662
02:02:24,557 --> 02:02:25,670
Good.

2663
02:02:31,469 --> 02:02:33,120
Hey! Hey!
- Diamond!

2664
02:02:33,734 --> 02:02:35,232
I saw it in the photo!

2665
02:02:35,462 --> 02:02:38,074
Today this diamond is mine, papa!

2666
02:02:39,226 --> 02:02:41,376
One, two, three.

2667
02:02:42,490 --> 02:02:46,637
My Pinto! Pinto!
Pinto! Somebody save him!

2668
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:48,826
Diamond! Diamond!
- Hold this!

2669
02:02:49,286 --> 02:02:50,746
Yes!
- Doctor!

2670
02:02:51,552 --> 02:02:52,819
Hey! Hey!

2671
02:02:53,549 --> 02:02:54,970
This is my diamond!

2672
02:02:55,661 --> 02:02:56,928
As long as D'mello Yadav is there..

2673
02:02:56,952 --> 02:02:58,181
..this is not possible!

2674
02:02:58,387 --> 02:02:59,630
Give me this diamond, Batlya!

2675
02:02:59,654 --> 02:03:00,922
Doctor! Doctor! Will I get well?

2676
02:03:01,843 --> 02:03:04,685
Will I get well?
- Leave me, Pinto! Leave!

2677
02:03:05,376 --> 02:03:07,142
Give it to me, Yadav!
- Yes!

2678
02:03:07,603 --> 02:03:09,024
Give me the diamond otherwise..

2679
02:03:09,907 --> 02:03:10,982
Here.

2680
02:03:12,326 --> 02:03:14,170
Who is the king of Mumbai!
- Me!

2681
02:03:17,088 --> 02:03:18,893
Come on! Come!

2682
02:03:18,970 --> 02:03:23,194
You fraud! You look so nice!

2683
02:03:23,616 --> 02:03:25,152
Catch him!
- Stops!

2684
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:26,419
Hey!

2685
02:03:26,496 --> 02:03:27,686
Dad, here!

2686
02:03:28,147 --> 02:03:29,299
Here!

2687
02:03:31,411 --> 02:03:32,909
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2688
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:36,442
Excuse me! Son, climb up!

2689
02:03:36,518 --> 02:03:37,978
Hang on! I will do it!

2690
02:03:38,170 --> 02:03:39,437
Excuse me!

2691
02:03:40,090 --> 02:03:41,760
My Pinto will die!

2692
02:03:41,856 --> 02:03:43,354
Don't make him stand on the car!

2693
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:45,504
Brother D'mello, throw the stick!
Throw the stick! - Hang on!

2694
02:03:45,581 --> 02:03:47,386
The stick is of no use! Throw the bag!

2695
02:03:52,992 --> 02:03:54,989
If anybody moved I won't spare you!

2696
02:03:57,024 --> 02:04:00,672
I know everything!
There is a bomb here!

2697
02:04:00,979 --> 02:04:02,784
Bomb and here? Who told you?

2698
02:04:02,861 --> 02:04:04,550
Here there is no bomb.
- No.

2699
02:04:04,666 --> 02:04:07,546
There is no bomb!
- No! No! No! No!

2700
02:04:07,853 --> 02:04:10,349
Mayawati Chowtala's
information can never be wrong!

2701
02:04:10,579 --> 02:04:12,077
Tek Chand!
- Come on!

2702
02:04:13,459 --> 02:04:15,802
Tell me, Albert. Where is the bomb?

2703
02:04:16,608 --> 02:04:19,680
He is a child. What will he know?
- Get lost!

2704
02:04:20,026 --> 02:04:21,485
We don't even know who he is!

2705
02:04:21,562 --> 02:04:23,059
There is no bomb here! Who are you?

2706
02:04:23,136 --> 02:04:25,248
There is a bomb!
- Which bomb?

2707
02:04:25,325 --> 02:04:26,362
The one whose battery is this!

2708
02:04:26,438 --> 02:04:28,819
Which battery?
- For the remote!

2709
02:04:28,896 --> 02:04:29,933
Oh no!

2710
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:33,197
This is not a bomb's remote!
- Then what remote is this?

2711
02:04:33,504 --> 02:04:35,309
This is a TV remote!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

2712
02:04:35,386 --> 02:04:37,651
Where is the TV?
- There is no TV! - TV..

2713
02:04:37,728 --> 02:04:39,994
We have the remote. We have to
buy the TV. - We will buy it later.

2714
02:04:40,070 --> 02:04:41,952
So this not a bomb's remote?
- No! No!

2715
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:43,526
The bomb won't
explode by pressing this?

2716
02:04:43,603 --> 02:04:44,947
No! No!

2717
02:04:45,293 --> 02:04:48,557
Then press it and check!
- Yes! No! No! No!

2718
02:04:48,634 --> 02:04:50,131
Why are you scared?

2719
02:04:50,208 --> 02:04:52,282
When there is no bomb, it
won't explode! - Correct!

2720
02:04:52,358 --> 02:04:55,238
And if it exploded then
you all will be in trouble.

2721
02:04:55,891 --> 02:04:57,120
So one..

2722
02:04:57,504 --> 02:04:58,656
No! No! No!

2723
02:04:59,078 --> 02:05:01,190
Two.. Where are you going?

2724
02:05:02,419 --> 02:05:03,494
Three!

2725
02:05:09,178 --> 02:05:10,752
There is no bomb here.

2726
02:05:10,829 --> 02:05:12,710
If there was a bomb,
it would have exploded.

2727
02:05:12,787 --> 02:05:14,093
And if there was an
explosion meaning there was a bomb!

2728
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:15,514
Yes! Yes! Yes!

2729
02:05:15,552 --> 02:05:19,795
Quiet! Silence! If anybody speaks..

2730
02:05:26,150 --> 02:05:28,877
Papa!
- Who spoke up? Speak louder!

2731
02:05:29,069 --> 02:05:30,797
Hail Goddess!
- Papa!

2732
02:05:30,874 --> 02:05:32,794
Say it again!
- Hail Goddess!

2733
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:35,136
I am asking who is making this noise!

2734
02:05:35,213 --> 02:05:36,787
Papa!

2735
02:05:37,594 --> 02:05:39,245
Who is stuck down?

2736
02:05:39,514 --> 02:05:41,971
Papa, I forgot to say
that this is a time bomb.

2737
02:05:42,048 --> 02:05:43,392
What are you saying?
- What!

2738
02:05:43,738 --> 02:05:47,654
By mistake I got time bomb
instead of remote bomb, papa.

2739
02:05:47,731 --> 02:05:50,227
Then at what time will it explode?

2740
02:05:50,304 --> 02:05:51,802
Uncle, at 6 o'clock!

2741
02:05:52,493 --> 02:05:54,566
By the way papa, what's the time?

2742
02:05:54,643 --> 02:05:56,832
Hang on! Hang on! 3 seconds to 6!

2743
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:59,789
It means one..
- Two..

2744
02:06:00,826 --> 02:06:02,131
Three.

2745
02:06:02,707 --> 02:06:05,856
Papa, did the bomb explode?
- One, two, three.

2746
02:06:10,656 --> 02:06:12,230
'Pinto's bomb blasted the diamond..

2747
02:06:12,307 --> 02:06:13,920
..and not the people into pieces.'

2748
02:06:14,496 --> 02:06:15,686
'Its said that nobody gets
anything before the right time..

2749
02:06:15,710 --> 02:06:17,208
..and more than what they deserve.'

2750
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:20,525
'Everybody got their
share of diamond.'

2751
02:06:21,101 --> 02:06:23,136
'What Laxminarayan one and Jia got..

2752
02:06:23,213 --> 02:06:25,440
..with that they bought their
share of restaurant from Munde.'

2753
02:06:25,978 --> 02:06:28,934
'Today too Laxmi's mother
wants her son to be a shooter.'

2754
02:06:29,126 --> 02:06:30,624
'And she tells the
same thing to every goon.'

2755
02:06:30,778 --> 02:06:34,310
If this time he fails, he is not
his father's son. Let me tell you.

2756
02:06:35,578 --> 02:06:38,765
'Laxminarayan two bought
some shares of virus autos..

2757
02:06:38,842 --> 02:06:39,878
..with his share..

2758
02:06:39,994 --> 02:06:42,298
..and today he is the board
of director in that company.'

2759
02:06:42,374 --> 02:06:43,526
'And his boss Pipat..'

2760
02:06:43,834 --> 02:06:45,062
Pipat.
- Yes, sir!

2761
02:06:45,370 --> 02:06:47,405
I think we need to talk.
- Yes, sir.

2762
02:06:47,482 --> 02:06:49,594
Sit. - Sir, on the
chair or the sofa? - Chair.

2763
02:06:49,901 --> 02:06:51,206
Left or right?
- Left.

2764
02:06:51,283 --> 02:06:52,666
Your left or my left?

2765
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,354
'Laxminarayan three sells underwear..

2766
02:06:55,392 --> 02:06:57,504
..and vest in a bus and not in a car.'

2767
02:06:57,734 --> 02:06:59,962
'And Laila is his brand ambassador.'

2768
02:07:01,190 --> 02:07:03,878
'Mayawati Chowtala gave
bribe with her share..

2769
02:07:03,994 --> 02:07:05,146
..and she has become a jailor.'

2770
02:07:05,606 --> 02:07:10,560
'And her prisoners are Albert,
Pinto, papa and Batlya.'

2771
02:07:11,712 --> 02:07:14,246
'Chandu and Chandni have
bought the showroom from Laila.'

2772
02:07:14,323 --> 02:07:16,627
'And it's heard that they
are going to marry soon.'

2773
02:07:16,896 --> 02:07:20,198
'But they are still
running in the race of life.'

2774
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:23,693
'To be one, two and three.'

2775
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,574
"Your youth."

2776
02:07:51,725 --> 02:07:53,376
