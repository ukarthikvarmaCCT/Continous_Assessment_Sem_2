1
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,160
[ MUSIC ]

2
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,358
We were first given a welcome drink
as soon as the we enter in the aircraft.

3
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,054
To be honest it was awsome.

4
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:43,350
Everyone does business class
travel for their own purposes,

5
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:46,553
i do because i get extra space.

6
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:48,650
I may sleep till my destination,

7
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,534
get a flat bed so that i can start my
work as soon as I reach my destination.

8
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:56,048
So, i don't get travel fatigue.

9
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,017
It has enough leg space,

10
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:00,489
this space is here to keep the stuff.

11
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:02,209
But can't keep at the
time of take off and landing.

12
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,685
If you don't want to watch
Tv, you can turn it back.

13
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,734
If you want to tookout the
table, you can took it out.

14
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:11,398
This is the standard, the
light will go on from here.

15
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:13,425
This is the seat controls.

16
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:14,017
Left,

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,620
Front, back,

18
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:16,638
Up and down.

19
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:18,166
This is the charging point.

20
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:19,925
One headset is given inside.

21
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:25,340
I travelled with Cathay, DELHI -
HONG KONG and back to Delhi.

22
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,058
In boeing 777 aircraft.

23
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:30,222
I find the seating arrangement
of Cathay airways amazing.

24
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:32,829
They have a configuration of 1-2-1.

25
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:33,204
Means,

26
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,759
1 seat on side, 2 in the
middle and then 1 in side.

27
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:38,820
Last year, when we went to U.S

28
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,760
So we in travelled
business class on the same

29
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:43,128
aircraft, the boeing 777
but of British Airways.

30
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:46,697
Althrough, you can lie down in
flight but i had trouble in turning.

31
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:49,293
There configuration looks like this,

32
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:50,561
It's look crowed.

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,361
And it was,

34
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,138
2-4-2

35
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:55,807
So, i can lie down like this,
so they don't have any option.

36
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:58,076
They will have to pass by walk my legs.

37
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:00,325
It's the worst thing while travelling.

38
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:02,735
The first thing we did when we came,

39
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,188
Remove the shoes.

40
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:04,966
And

41
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,408
Waers cabin slipers.

42
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:36,447
On every seat of Business
class there is a amenities pouch,

43
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:37,736
in which you got basic amenities,

44
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:40,062
Like an eye patch to sleep,

45
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,079
Body lotion,

46
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:44,619
Face mist,

47
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:47,926
Lip balm,

48
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:53,133
Brush, Toothpaste,

49
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:54,074
Mouthwash

50
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,508
And i don't know what was this.

51
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:01,616
But this pouch was of very
good quality and i kept this safely.

52
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:04,235
This help me to keep my
camera gadgets and accessories.

53
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,922
The cabin crew came and
took our order even before taxi.

54
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:11,220
If you are vegetarian then make sure
you tell them before booking otherwise,

55
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:16,182
It becomes very difficult to get veg
food in foreign flights if you don't order.

56
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,605
The flight was going great
and the take off was great too.

57
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,556
But what i realise after take-off, Oh Man!

58
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,102
This is the boeing 777 Aircraft.

59
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:36,282
And the one I've flown before was
an Airbus 350 from Cathay Airways,

60
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:40,137
Airbus 350 is a new aircraft
and boeing 777 is an old aircraft.

61
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:46,623
I decided to check the
sound levels on my Iphone.

62
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:48,007
Noise levels were,

63
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,890
Too far than 80 decimals
Amplitude which is a but noisy.

64
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:05,570
The small seat in front of
me, I can fit a small kid in it.

65
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:09,173
But whatever you say, the
space given in this aircraft,

66
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:10,969
 I loved it, I love space.

67
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:14,654
I mean this space, the space
of space, not the space of space.

68
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,953
On the side of your
seat, there is space where

69
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,578
all your small things
will come, phone etc.

70
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:21,209
There is space below where
your big things will come.

71
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,604
There is space in front
where your shoes will come.

72
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:26,457
And above that there is space, there
is a small seat where there is leg space.

73
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:29,707
I mean people who say there is
space in life, they should come here.

74
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:50,533
In-flight entertainment, the TV screen
given to you, its size is very good.

75
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,660
And in-flight entertainment
is also very good.

76
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,597
I decided, let's play a video game today.

77
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:02,613
It's a long flight, I'll download
some Stuff on my phone and see,

78
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:03,488
I said, let's see that.

79
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:04,536
 It was meal time,

80
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:07,545
And before the meal, I ordered
one red wine and some nuts.

81
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,596
- Thank you

82
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:18,156
As soon as my drink was over,

83
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,588
 the crew prepared my table very well.

84
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:21,901
And my meal came.

85
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,652
There was a special note with the meal.

86
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:29,137
I am saying again and again that
if you are traveling internationally.

87
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,426
And if you are a vegetarian, please make
sure you tell them during ticket booking

88
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:34,958
That you are taking a veg
meal, it will not be a lot of trouble.

89
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:36,201
When the meal came,

90
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:38,963
 I was a little shocked to see it.

91
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:44,628
I was only given salad in the meal.

92
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,102
And raw mushrooms were
given to me in the salad.

93
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,407
I thought, maybe this is healthy in
Hong Kong, people must be eating there.

94
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:55,407
But then I realized that this is an
appetizer, the meal will come later.

95
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:03,701
Then I was thinking that how
can I eat this bread with salad ?

96
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,164
And do you know why it was happening?

97
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:06,813
It was the wonder of a wine.

98
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:09,108
But when you go to a
new country, you think,

99
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,866
 maybe this is the custom here.

100
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:20,776
Immediately after this, dinner was served.

101
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:22,562
It was a good dinner, it was fun to eat.

102
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:25,586
But now I started enjoying the raw mushrooms.

103
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:28,478
Finally, the meal came.

104
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,414
I thought I would have to eat
raw mushrooms with bread.

105
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,141
But no, I was wrong, obviously I was wrong.

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,844
No one can be so cruel.

107
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:35,864
But this looks good.

108
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:36,934
- Thank you

109
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:41,425
- Yes, I make travel videos on YouTube

110
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,590
That's what I do professionally

111
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:47,646
Whenever I travel, I share my experience, how was it.

112
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:49,118
Stuff like that.

113
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:51,049
I travel a lot

114
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:55,408
- Whenever you need food, please
call us, thank you 
- Thank you so much

115
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,558
Dinner is done, I ordered one more wine and

116
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:01,677
cheese platter.

117
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,659
Cheers !

118
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:08,777
Oh man,

119
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,253
such a big washroom.

120
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,934
I have seen such a big washroom
in an aircraft for the first time, 777.

121
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:16,305
Usually,

122
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:19,584
washrooms this much in
size, cards are given here.

123
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,888
And this space is used in the galley.

124
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,110
Means this part,

125
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,109
Think, move this part
forward, happens here.

126
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,266
But this is,

127
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,142
Oh man.

128
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:29,394
But this is so much space.

129
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,431
 777 is a big aircraft,

130
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,848
 It has a lot of space but still,

131
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:34,825
 Airline saves space.

132
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,656
But I love the space on this aircraft

133
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:38,477
The only thing I don't like is

134
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:41,052
The engines are a little noisy.

135
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,308
My elbows are so dry.

136
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,736
Why i am realizing
everything in the washroom.

137
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:00,084
Do you know why my elbows are dry?

138
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:02,145
Because I srtike people with my elbow.

139
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:08,196
Man, the whole aircraft's
lights are turned off

140
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:10,771
This is the signal to stop vlogging.

141
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:12,086
And go to sleep

142
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,177
Guys, in this 5-hour flight, we
spent 2.5 hours like this.

143
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:16,832
All the people around us have gone to sleep.

144
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:19,350
Now, let's put our bed sheets and get ready to sleep.

145
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:22,768
You get two things on the bed,

146
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,598
One to wear one,

147
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,224
And one to lay down.

148
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,445
I have never laid down bedsheet in my life.

149
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,516
Whether I travel in a railway,

150
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,413
Whether I travel in a plane,

151
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:30,334
Even if I sleep at home.

152
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,688
I just take it to wear.

153
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,873
But today,

154
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:34,004
 because I am making a review.

155
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:35,758
I have to work properly.

156
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,576
And by the way, this
review is not sponsored at all.

157
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,469
I have made ready my bed, ready to sleep.

158
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:08,038
I turned off the lights.

159
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:08,902
And bbye..

160
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:40,341
The trip is over.

161
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:41,814
Time to go home and see the kids.

162
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,434
The trip was very comfortable.

163
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:44,646
The food was amazing.

164
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:47,256
The overall experience was
very good, Big thumbs up.
