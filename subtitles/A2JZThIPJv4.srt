1
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,670
[Car engine starts]

2
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,110
Come inside.

3
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,310
[Glass shattering]

4
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,940
[Vansh] I could've never
imagined the day

5
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,460
when we would've had to deal
with the police to save our homes.

6
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,500
I thought only the slum dwellers
have to deal with such problems.

7
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,180
The government only
razes their homes.

8
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,420
We are decent people.
We vote, pay taxes.

9
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,030
Ration Card, Aadhar Card,
you name it we have it.

10
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,950
This can never happen to us.

11
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,500
Well, guess what.
It's happening with us.

12
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,790
Soon our homes will be razed to the
ground, while we watch helplessly.

13
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,460
When the government decides
to screw with you

14
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,420
then your consent
doesn't really matter.

15
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,390
You will be f****d, and how.

16
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,060
[Shouting]

17
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,190
[Vansh] I can never forget
the Summer of 2011.

18
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,220
That year, after my class
12 board exams I got a job.

19
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,740
And, when I had
saved enough money

20
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,660
I went to America on
my first backpacking trip.

21
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,780
America.

22
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,080
When I got there,
I understood what life really is.

23
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,780
[Door opens]

24
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,610
Vansh, didn't you sleep at all?

25
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,500
Now get ready soon, we've to go.

26
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,890
[Vansh]
After I returned I realized...

27
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,980
- [Yawning]
- ...how shitty life is in India.

28
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,660
Out here, we middle-class people
keep rubbing, grinding, boiling.

29
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,570
#lifesucks

30
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,850
- [Vansh] Morning.
- You're awake.

31
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,050
No, I am sleepwalking.

32
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,570
Don't walk while shitting.

33
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,570
Vansh, get me the iron
and the ironing board, son.

34
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Yes, Grandpa.

35
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,410
Happy birthday, Papa.

36
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,930
- Bless you, dear.
- Bless me.

37
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,970
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

38
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,220
How many years has it been?

39
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,530
Still 18 years short of a century.

40
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,010
- [Vansh] You're joking.
- Did you add sugar?

41
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,850
If you want to complete a century,
then no sugar.

42
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,890
[Grandpa] Forget it.

43
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,490
[Man] Are you going
to the court today?

44
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,540
The government has declared my
birthday as a national holiday yet.

45
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,850
[Both chuckling]

46
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,020
Let's go, Vansh. We're
getting late. Come on, hurry up.

47
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,410
[Softly] Himansh, Papa's gift.

48
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,860
I'll arrange it by evening.

49
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,700
[Door slams]

50
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,700
Call the carpenter.

51
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,830
It just needs oil,
I'll do it myself.

52
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,170
[Door closes]

53
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,970
[Vansh] Out here you got
to fight for everything.

54
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,930
Like mom...

55
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,650
In order to save
a couple of hundred rupees

56
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,410
she travels daily one hour
to the wholesale market.'

57
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,210
So mister,
how old are your vegetables today?

58
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,010
These tomatoes are
from the British Rule.

59
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,810
2 kilos of potatoes,
2 kilos of tomatoes.

60
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,140
[Vansh] I don't want to live
like this. I want to go to America.

61
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,380
That's where the future is.

62
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,880
What opportunity does
anyone have out here?

63
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,930
[Vansh] Mom, did you talk to papa?

64
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,530
For your Washington University?

65
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,160
- Washington School of Business.
- Yeah, I know.

66
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
- And?
- Papa will break his FDs.

67
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,410
And next month my PPF
is maturing as well.

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,370
We'll manage, you chill out.

69
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,250
Chill out and all, huh.

70
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,650
If my son's going to America,
even I'll have an accent.

71
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,580
Good morning, Uncle.

72
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,530
[Vansh] If my father had
a business out here

73
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,290
then even I would've
done something.

74
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,490
But my dear papa blew it.

75
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,800
Walk faster. Faster...

76
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,050
[Both chuckling]

77
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,100
[Vansh] He had a well-settled
travel business.

78
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,490
But five years ago

79
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,850
it crashed because of some
turbulence in his mind.

80
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,850
What a loser.

81
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,060
Bro, there are a couple
more on the fifth floor.

82
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,440
Sharpen it properly.
Okay.

83
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,150
[Door opens]

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,370
[Vansh] So after
the business closed down

85
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,930
papa took up a job
in order to run the house.

86
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,850
Mom started her own
lunch-box business

87
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,610
and I am getting out of here
to make my life.

88
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,850
Go and sleep.

89
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,970
[Vansh] Goodnight.

90
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,780
I'll do a management program in
America and then settle down there.

91
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,250
In short, MCMC...

92
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,900
Every man for himself.

93
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,490
[Cooker hissing]

94
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,570
- Ganesh, the vegetables are done.
- Yes.

95
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,730
Why do you sound so low today?

96
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,430
- Focus, and do it properly.
- [Woman] Yes.

97
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,250
Lord!

98
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,280
[Cell phone ringing]

99
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,180
Yeah.

100
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,180
I am searching online
for a gift for papa.

101
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,860
You won't get any lunch today.

102
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,180
Did you drop the lunchbox again?

103
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,380
[Woman] Sorry...

104
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,060
Don't worry. I'll order
some lunch from Radhakrishna.

105
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,570
Listen, I am thinking of wearing
the yellow dress in the evening.

106
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,730
Wear the red one which
you wore at Amit's son's wedding.

107
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,220
You were looking nice.

108
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,100
I've already posted two pictures
in that dress on Facebook.

109
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,340
Sister-in-law will think that
I don't have any other clothes.

110
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,270
Okay, fine. Wear the yellow one.
You look nice in every color.

111
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,050
Did you talk to Hina?

112
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,860
I WhatsApped her.

113
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,490
They will come directly
to the hotel, don't worry.

114
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,290
Okay, bye.

115
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,240
- Tell me something.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,900
What's the difference
between these two phones?

117
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,940
Sir, this one has a face scanner.

118
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,530
And this one has a finger scanner.

119
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,380
This phone with the face scanner
is worth 100,000, isn't it?

120
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,490
Yes.

121
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,410
Papa will get confused.

122
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,970
I want something
that's user-friendly

123
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,850
and nothing complicated.

124
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,100
This one with the
finger scanner is better.

125
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,970
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,380
Should I order it for you?

127
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,370
Buying stuff online is very dicey.

128
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,810
Sometimes they send
a bar of soap in the mobile box.

129
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,850
- Mr. Sethi.
- Yes.

130
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,410
- The boss is calling you.
- Okay.

131
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,700
And, father's birthday is today.

132
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,130
- I will buy it at the mall.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,330
Did you read
Thapar family's complaint?

134
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,410
"Travelon ruined
our trip to Georgia.

135
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,330
What was supposed
to be a family vacation

136
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,620
turned out to be a trip
to hell and back."

137
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,210
Georgia immigration deported
them from Tbilisi airport

138
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,930
but, our travel agency
is not at fault here.

139
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,290
Why were they deported?

140
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,090
Their e-visa was rejected.

141
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,460
Why did you get them
an e-visa in the first place?

142
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,050
You could've double-checked
before the departure.

143
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,850
I could've never imagined that

144
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,450
immigration would reject
our government's e-visa.

145
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,570
Pretty unexpected things
are happening these days.

146
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,160
Mr. Sethi, our job is
to expect the unexpected.

147
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,860
So that our client's
vacation is not ruined.

148
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,370
Who could've imagined...

149
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,410
It doesn't matter
who is right or wrong.

150
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,090
But the buck stops on us.

151
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,380
- Just listen...
- Listen to what?

152
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,300
[Sighs]

153
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,620
Okay, let's go back in time.

154
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,210
When online booking
websites were started.

155
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,970
Those were the days when
travel agencies ruled the business.

156
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,640
You had your very own flourishing
travel agency,

157
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,850
and you were the boss.

158
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,500
And my dad was your employee.

159
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,890
When my dad worked
for your company

160
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,690
he treated you more
like an ideal, then a boss.

161
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,380
He learned everything from you
and started this Travelon.

162
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,790
And when your business closed down,
and you needed work

163
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,700
he immediately offered you
a job here, right?

164
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,480
Right, sir.

165
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,410
But that doesn't mean
that you make silly mistakes.

166
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,690
Do you understand?

167
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,260
I do.

168
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,890
Thank you for understanding.

169
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,740
And please make sure
these things don't happen again.

170
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,780
You can go now, thank you.

171
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,330
Mr. Sethi,
you should've taken an off today.

172
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,730
Anything special, sir?

173
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,220
It's his birthday today.

174
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,810
Oh! Many, many,
happy returns of the day.

175
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,530
- Thank you.
- Please proceed.

176
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,660
Thank you.

177
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,180
Your honor, Kala Kruti Society

178
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,680
has received water only
on 7 days in the last four months.

179
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,510
On the other days,
they used a water tanker.

180
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,290
But the Municipality has
sent them four months bill.

181
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,820
Supported documents, your honor.

182
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,330
Your honor,
when we didn't receive water

183
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,850
then what is this bill for?

184
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,320
I request you
to direct the Municipality

185
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,980
to take this bill back.

186
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,980
Mr. Phulke...

187
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,770
now you speak.

188
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,130
Water was not supplied, your honor,
because Kala Kruti Society

189
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,020
is an unauthorized construction.

190
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,100
But...

191
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,740
Objection, your honor.

192
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,210
This case is about over-billing

193
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
and not about
unauthorized construction.

194
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,700
Objection overruled.

195
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,330
Mr. Phulke, if the entire
society is unauthorized

196
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,290
then why hasn't
any action been taken.

197
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,930
The action has been taken, sir.

198
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,460
BMC has already sent
two notices to the society.

199
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,730
The first notice
on 5th September 1995.

200
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,380
And the second notice was
served on 9th June 1999, sir.

201
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,690
Is the Municipality's
responsibility

202
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,300
only serving notice?

203
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,260
This is why half the constructions
in Mumbai are illegal.

204
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,860
Can I say something, your honor?

205
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,260
Yes, please.

206
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,930
More than 100 families
have been living

207
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,420
in this society
for the last 22 years.

208
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,650
Comprising of young and old alike.

209
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,220
That doesn't make
the society legal.

210
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,290
According to Section 53
of Maharashtra

211
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,730
regional town planning Act 1966

212
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,210
Kala Kruti Society is
an unauthorized construction.

213
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,930
The court orders the Municipality

214
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,610
to completely raze down
Kala Kruti Society.

215
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,180
To be demolished
with immediate effect.

216
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,090
[Gavel pounds]

217
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,380
[All] Happy birthday to you.

218
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,450
Happy birthday to you.

219
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,250
Come on, Grandpa, blow the candle.

220
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,580
Happy birthday, dear Papa.

221
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,500
Yeah! Let's demolish this cake,
Grandpa.

222
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,010
[Woman laughing]

223
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,570
It's a beautiful cake, Bharti.

224
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,940
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

225
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,630
Papa...

226
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,490
This is a phone for you.

227
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,900
See, I told you.

228
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,690
You should ask Brother Himansh once
before buying a gift for father.

229
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,390
What happened, Bharti?

230
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,610
Even he bought a phone for papa.

231
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,370
[Man chuckles] So what?

232
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,100
Papa will use two phones.
That's not a problem.

233
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,130
Wow, Grandpa. Two phones.

234
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,170
This phone's equipped
with new technology.

235
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,650
It scans your face to unlock.

236
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,450
Face recognition.

237
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,370
Wow!

238
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,210
What will I do with two phones?

239
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,090
Yes, Grandpa.

240
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,970
Give me that phone
with face recognition.

241
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,210
[Women laughing]

242
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,820
Why do you need that phone?

243
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,820
I gave you a brand new
for your birthday.

244
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,970
I've given you a new phone
on your birthday.

245
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,020
Himansh, he is just joking.

246
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,140
I'll just go to the loo.

247
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,260
Even I'll go to the bathroom.
[Chuckles softly]

248
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,580
Let's eat the cake.

249
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,750
Parents are like old mobile phones.

250
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,490
They become outdated pretty soon.

251
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,740
So let it go.

252
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,740
I was just cracking a joke.

253
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,530
People in India don't
have a sense of humor.

254
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,730
[Unzips]

255
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,600
Whenever I am in a bad mood,
I think about the US.

256
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,620
Swear man,
I can't wait to get out of here.

257
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,420
Swear, even I am
tired of dad's lectures.

258
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,130
Look...

259
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,220
Look at Vansh.
Get marks like Vansh.

260
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,770
Stupid.
Look at Vansh.

261
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,090
He's found a source
to go to the US.

262
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,890
Vansh. Vansh. Vansh.

263
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,690
I am their son,
but you are their favorite.

264
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,300
Come on, let's exchange fathers.

265
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,880
[Both chuckle]

266
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,460
Why didn't Hina show up,
Sister-in-law?

267
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,100
She must be busy.

268
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,660
She's newly married after all.

269
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,330
Yeah, she just
got married recently.

270
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,180
And newly married couples
need some time alone.

271
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,380
[Coughs] Give it here.

272
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,580
- I am paying, Brother.
- I insist.

273
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,750
Whose idea was it
to bring everyone here?

274
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,060
Who is older?

275
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,530
Stop insisting, Brother.
I am paying the bill.

276
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,280
Why? Do you think
I can't afford it?

277
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,300
Take it.

278
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,260
[Woman] Did you win a jackpot?

279
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,890
You won't understand.

280
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,610
Then please explain it to me.

281
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,850
Hriday's gift was more expensive
than yours, so it hurt your ego.

282
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,170
And you paid the bill
which was 15,000.

283
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,050
Next week we've to pay Vansh's
fee for the American University.

284
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,450
We've to arrange
for 2.5 million rupees.

285
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,460
- We can't arrange for that, and...
- Fine, I made a mistake.

286
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,450
I got emotional.

287
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,320
I wish I could give
you guys the same life

288
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,090
that Hriday gives his family.

289
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,610
If Sethi Travels hadn't
closed down, Vandana

290
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,220
then I would've never taken up
this job that pays only 50,000.

291
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,740
You wouldn't have to make
lunch boxes every morning.

292
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,560
Hina could've had a grand wedding.
Vansh could've gone off to America.

293
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,990
I am a failure.

294
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,020
Himansh,
we've been married for 27 years.

295
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,650
Every morning you make tea for me.

296
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,410
And I wonder that
I couldn't have found

297
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,140
anyone who would've
made better tea for me.

298
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,200
[Chuckles]
I swear.

299
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,260
My gold medalist husband.

300
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,640
[Vandana] Stupid.

301
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,760
And my job is not a helplessness,
I like doing it.

302
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,810
You know

303
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,530
I received such great comments
on my lunch box WhatsApp group.

304
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,260
I made Punjabi curry.

305
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,660
Look what he said.

306
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,520
"The Curry was awesome."

307
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,290
And he spelled awesome with "OSUM".

308
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,180
See... he can't even spell.

309
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,940
Shweta gave me three thumbs up.
She never even gives one.

310
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,510
She's such a grouch.
Look this...

311
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,070
[Doorbell ringing]

312
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,370
[Knocking on the door]

313
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,210
[Grandpa]
Who's knocking on the door?

314
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,460
I'll check, Father.

315
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,100
[Doorbell ringing]

316
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,250
[Door opens]

317
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,420
[Himansh] Rishi.

318
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,820
Is everything all right?

319
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,490
Why didn't you guys
show up at dinner?

320
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,580
Where is Hina?

321
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,780
- Hina isn't here?
- No.

322
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,890
[Tongue clicks]

323
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,160
Please get me a Disprin?

324
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,530
[Himansh] Son.

325
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,250
Did she say she's coming here?

326
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,540
Where is Hina?

327
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,310
We had a fight last night.

328
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,870
She left home in a fit of rage.

329
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,970
I thought she would've come here.

330
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,750
You two had a fight last night
and you're telling us now.

331
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,090
- Phone...
- Yes.

332
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,310
I tried calling her, Aunty,
but her number's switched off.

333
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,490
You should've informed us
last night.

334
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,180
I'll try calling Akruti.

335
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,090
Hello, Akruti.
Is Hina at your place?

336
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,030
Okay.

337
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,010
Why did you let her go?

338
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
I tried to stop her, Uncle.

339
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,840
But you know how stubborn
your daughter is.

340
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,460
[Vansh] Let's call the Police.

341
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,770
Even the police won't take a
missing complaint before 24 hours.

342
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,090
Don't talk nonsense now.

343
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,730
But I don't think
she will go to a friend.

344
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,050
- Where else will she go?
- Hotels, guest houses, maybe.

345
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,170
There's no way
she could've gone to a hotel.

346
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,970
- There's no harm in checking.
- Okay, Papa.

347
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,250
Hina is at Parkhi's house.

348
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,490
- Let's go get her back.
- Yes, let's go. Let's go.

349
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,180
- Yes, let's go.
- Let's go.

350
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,210
And don't get angry or yell at her.

351
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,700
- Talk softly.
- [Himansh] Yes, Father.

352
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,740
Come, sir.

353
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,080
[Woman voiceover]
Please close the door.

354
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,520
[Lift door closes]

355
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,480
[Door opens and closes]

356
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,060
Hello...

357
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,330
What's the matter? The Sethi
family seems to be in a hurry.

358
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
Come on.

359
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,350
[Doorbell ringing]

360
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,990
[Door opens]

361
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,290
Hina, are you okay, dear?

362
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,530
Why didn't you come home?

363
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,020
Yeah, why didn't you come home?

364
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,010
Tell Rishi to leave.

365
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,170
- Come on, Hina.
- Papa, just tell him to leave.

366
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,380
Shut up, okay?

367
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,970
Go ahead, yell at me.

368
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,740
That's all you can do.

369
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,940
Go ahead, drink.
Drink and yell.

370
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,380
You told me to f**k off,
didn't you?

371
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,330
Now you f**k off.

372
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,020
See... that's the problem
with your daughter.

373
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,970
She was missing all day.

374
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,010
And now after giving us a heart
attack, she is showing attitude.

375
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,090
- Take it easy, okay?
- Why?

376
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,450
- She's my wife.
- And she's my sister.

377
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,770
- Whatever?
- Rishi. Rishi.

378
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,540
Rishi, son.
Please leave for now.

379
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,220
- But, Papa...
- I said leave.

380
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,950
Go.

381
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,480
[Door opens]

382
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,620
[Door closes]

383
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,260
Come, Hina, let's go home.

384
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,870
[Grandpa]
I'll sue him for mental torture!

385
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,890
Tell that rascal
to stay away from my sights.

386
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,800
Or I will break his legs.

387
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,180
We all advised you not
to marry that alcoholic.

388
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,690
He's already been divorced once.

389
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,220
- Why did you marry him?
- Shut up, Vansh.

390
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,290
[Hina sighs]

391
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,000
I knew that you will all
give me the "I told you so" speech.

392
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,690
That's why I went to Parkhi's home.

393
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,820
At least she doesn't judge me.

394
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,010
I know I screwed up. Okay?
I know.

395
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,790
I thought I could change him.

396
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,790
Love would change him.

397
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,930
But I was stupid.

398
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,580
I am such an idiot.

399
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,980
Stupid.

400
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,590
No, dear.
Just forget what happened.

401
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,290
Marrying Rishi was a mistake.

402
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,970
But you're also making
a mistake thinking

403
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,330
your parents won't support you.

404
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,280
Huh?

405
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,780
Hina. Vansh.

406
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,780
You two must remember...

407
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,180
Doesn't matter what happens in
life, anything at all, any problems

408
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,520
you two have a home,
and always will.

409
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,100
Everything will be fine.
You are my strong child.

410
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,090
- Everything will be fine.
- [Vansh clears throat]

411
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,340
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

412
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,860
Drink this tea.

413
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,180
Sorry.

414
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,130
I am not making any stories.

415
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,300
My wallet got stolen from
that restaurant around the corner.

416
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,660
Doesn't matter. Don't worry.

417
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,170
So boy, what notice
did you bring today?

418
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,310
Demolition.

419
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,620
Demolition?

420
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,210
You should always
wear a cap outside.

421
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,770
What's up, Chaubey?

422
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,870
This guy is from the Municipality
to serve another notice.

423
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,630
Come. Come.

424
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,450
What is this notice now?

425
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,010
Brother, why did you bring
notice so early in the morning?

426
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,810
Come with me, I'll treat you
to a nice cup of tea.

427
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,720
- Come on.
- Give that tea to Mr. Brijmohan.

428
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,180
He went to court to file
a case against the Municipality.

429
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,290
The judge has served
a demolition notice instead.

430
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,270
Now you will all have to pay.

431
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,100
Hey listen...

432
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,880
What's this about demolition now?

433
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,840
Madam, here you go.
There's a meeting.

434
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,490
Madam, here you go.

435
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,700
Sir, here you go.

436
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,340
[Woman] On the 6th floor...

437
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,640
Yeah, yeah, the lift's for
you guys, right. Move.

438
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,190
What's wrong, Chaubey?

439
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,360
Who's making you run
a marathon in the morning?

440
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,380
This building is
going to be demolished.

441
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,610
I am warning you guys,
find another job.

442
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,290
Have you ever seen these
buildings getting demolished?

443
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,910
Nothing is going to happen.

444
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,370
Instead, they will grease
palms and set things.

445
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,080
The lift had to break down today?

446
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,630
Here you go, madam.

447
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,020
[Doorbell ringing]

448
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,930
[Door opens]

449
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,040
Madam.

450
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,220
Here.

451
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,870
Is this April fool?

452
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,840
Demolition order?

453
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,300
What is this new problem now?

454
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,520
What is this, Chaubey?

455
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,040
Emergency meeting.

456
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,440
[Tongue clicks] Oh no.

457
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,720
What? This house is illegal.

458
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,480
Why did you go to the court
in the first place, Father?

459
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,120
You knew all about this.

460
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,460
Why didn't anyone tell me?

461
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,380
You've started this new problem.

462
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,900
Why is everyone
screaming in the morning?

463
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,410
- Where is the fire?
- Here.

464
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,050
How dare they mention
my name in this?

465
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,910
We're out of mint and coriander.
Can someone go get it?

466
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,330
They are calling grandpa senile,
how mean.

467
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,500
They are senile.
I'll see them at the meeting.

468
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,370
Why buy a house here
when the building was illegal?

469
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,950
I didn't know at the time of buying
that the building is illegal.

470
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,810
Why didn't you ask me?

471
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,030
Why didn't you ask me?

472
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,090
I could have investigated this.

473
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,730
Papa, I wanted this to be a
surprise for you, to mom, Vandana.

474
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,880
We're out of lemons as well.
Someone get that too.

475
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,530
- [Himansh] Okay, Vandana.
- Surprise, yes.

476
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,390
This is the mother
of all surprises.

477
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,050
I feel like my whole life is a lie.

478
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,000
Cool.

479
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,360
You know how these builders
and politicians fool people.

480
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,980
And you turned out to
be the biggest fool of all.

481
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,320
Papa, why are you yelling at me now
for a mistake I made 22 years ago.

482
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,650
- Why not?
- Himansh. Papa.

483
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,190
The demolition won't stop
if you fight amongst yourselves.

484
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,880
It's better if you call
for a meeting of the society.

485
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,860
Then you'll find a solution.

486
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,780
Or tell me,
I'll go attend the meeting

487
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,030
and you guys finish
packing the lunchboxes.

488
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,230
- No, I will go change first.
- This is the bits.

489
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,840
This demolition will never happen.

490
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,520
Go and get the ingredients
I asked for.

491
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,050
- I've to finish making the sauce.
- [Brijmohan] Illegal...

492
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,640
- Mom...
- Go, hurry up.

493
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,420
We are soon going to
become mincemeat in the meeting.

494
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,510
Vaibhav, we've been
served demolition orders.

495
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,490
We have an important meeting.
Aren't you going to attend?

496
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,770
Sorry, I have a shoot.

497
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,630
Bachchan sir is waiting for me.
So got to rush.

498
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,830
Next time.

499
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,860
We never saw him on TV and
Bachchan sir is waiting for him.

500
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,370
[Women giggling]

501
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,820
I am sure you all know that because
of Mr. Brijmohan's single mistake

502
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,910
we're facing a big problem.

503
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,640
Now we must together
find a solution.

504
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,160
What mistake?

505
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,250
Who is he to defend the society
against the Municipality?

506
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,470
Who are you?

507
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,290
Are you the Collector?
Or the Prime Minister?

508
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,230
Who made him the leader?

509
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,870
We've been living in this society
for all these years.

510
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,190
Why did you do such a thing?

511
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll give it in writing that
we'll lose our home because of him.

512
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,300
- Because of me?
- Of course.

513
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,440
Because of me.

514
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,630
What are you saying, Mr. Gehi?

515
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,050
I was fighting for you.

516
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,880
And you sent me
this circular instead.

517
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,250
You have insulted me and I will
sue all of you for defamation.

518
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,340
[Indistinct murmuring]

519
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,930
What defamation, Mr. Sethi?

520
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,150
We're facing demolition now.

521
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,730
- I'll do that...
- How can you talk like that?

522
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,930
[Man] Please, sit down.
Please...

523
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,240
What are you saying?

524
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,610
We should listen first.

525
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,630
My brother-in-law...

526
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,350
My brother-in-law is an
advocate in the Supreme Court.

527
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,790
- Calm down. Calm down...
- It's okay.

528
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,100
Calm down.

529
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,620
Make him understand.

530
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,050
This is not done.

531
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,410
The entire building
will be demolished.

532
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,360
Look.

533
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,580
Nice, isn't it?

534
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,410
She has proposed marriage.
[Chuckles softly]

535
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,980
Pray that this happens.

536
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,120
- I am tired of jerking off.
- [Snickering]

537
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,070
[Woman] Silence!

538
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,700
Silence, sit down.

539
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,210
Sethi uncle,
we bought illegal homes.

540
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,450
We made a mistake.

541
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,480
But how can we complain, tell me?

542
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,390
How is it our mistake?

543
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,710
Was it a mistake that we trusted
the government and the builder?

544
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,570
We saved every penny
and bought a flat here.

545
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,280
How would we know that
the building is illegal?

546
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,440
And if the building was illegal

547
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,650
then why didn't the Municipality
raze it down.

548
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,400
We're paying property tax,
electricity bill

549
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,350
then how is illegal.

550
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,310
Look Brij,
your intentions are right

551
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,980
but what you did was wrong.

552
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

553
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,690
Last month when I wrote
a letter to the Police

554
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,390
and got rid of those junkies,
then that was right.

555
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,460
[Woman exhales]

556
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,610
When I got the garbage
cleared in front of our building

557
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,840
then that was right.

558
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,490
- But this is wrong.
- What's the point?

559
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,670
The garbage is still there.

560
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,500
And those junkies are back again.

561
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,600
But at least he tried.

562
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,530
It's 11 o'clock,
I must take Pluto to the doctor.

563
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,360
[Whispering]
Let's go from here, please.

564
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,530
This is so boring.

565
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,000
Hang on,
let's see what they decide.

566
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,200
Let's make out.
F**k this decision.

567
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,360
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

568
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,470
Listen, I am ovulating, okay.

569
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,230
And the office starts tomorrow.

570
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,770
You won't get a chance
for another week.

571
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,730
After that I am chumming.
[Audio not clear]

572
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,530
You want to be a daddy, no?

573
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,150
- Sure.
- Then let's go.

574
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,600
- Sure?
- Yeah.

575
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:11,930
Then let's go.

576
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,690
What's my mistake
if the garbage is back?

577
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,210
[Himansh] Papa!

578
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,330
Calm down. Please calm down.

579
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,080
Look, there's no point
in yelling and shouting.

580
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,660
- [Coughing]
- What's done is done?

581
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,680
Are you okay, Mr. Gehi?
You don't have to worry, Mr. Gehi.

582
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,950
They won't just run over
our building with the bulldozer.

583
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,060
It's not that easy.

584
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,740
They are just trying to scare us.

585
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,510
You see when uncle filed a case

586
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,590
he hurt the Municipality's ego.

587
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,460
So we'll find a middle way. Simple.

588
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,970
You know what, uncle.

589
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,480
Come with me and apologize
to the Municipality officer.

590
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,680
- [Man 2] Right.
- End of story.

591
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,840
Isn't it?

592
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,070
[Man 3] Correct.

593
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,290
Proposed by Mr. Motwani,
seconded by Secretary Nirmala.

594
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,300
Accepted.

595
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,700
Just a minute, Nirmala.

596
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,030
Motwani sir,
you want me to apologize.

597
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,890
[Motwani] Yes.

598
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,270
Then let me make it clear
that I won't apologize.

599
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,400
I will sue them, I'll take them
to the Supreme Court.

600
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,490
[Motwani] What's the point
of making things worse?

601
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,640
Everyone's talking just nonsense.

602
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,640
Get lost.
I am done.

603
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,490
[Man 4] Listen to me.

604
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,370
[Man 5]
When our house will demolish...

605
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,700
[Vansh] There can never be
a revolution in India.

606
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,050
Because the rich don't need it,
the poor don't have courage.

607
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,210
And the middle-class
don't have time.

608
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,360
And I don't have any interest

609
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,920
because I am out of here
in two months.

610
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,500
Mom is waiting for you.

611
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,750
Hi.

612
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,860
- Hi.
- When did you come back?

613
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,960
Yesterday.

614
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,260
So where are you heading to?

615
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,620
- Gym?
- How is Rishi?

616
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,680
- Okay.
- I heard that she came back.

617
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,870
So soon.

618
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,940
Yeah. Marriages these days
are like made in China.

619
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,880
They don't last
for more than 6 months.

620
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,130
[Giggling]

621
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,920
Meeting adjourned.

622
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,440
[Burps]

623
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,220
[Sighs]

624
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,680
Vandana, the food was delicious.

625
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,210
- You guys continue.
- Wait, Papa.

626
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,650
Wait.

627
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,080
What happened?

628
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,610
[Vandana chuckles softly]

629
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,910
Wow!

630
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,090
You're showing a lot of love today.
[Chuckles]

631
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,290
Well...

632
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,650
[Brij chuckles]

633
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,920
Papa, please say sorry.

634
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,360
Please.

635
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:40,490
When my children don't understand,
then forget the society.

636
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,160
And you're giving me sugar.

637
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,430
Do you want to kill me?

638
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,340
This is the limit.

639
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,130
The limit.

640
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,200
[Doorbell rings]

641
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,540
Go.

642
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,360
Uh...

643
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,620
Finish your dinner, Himansh.

644
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,170
Prince Charming is here.

645
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,790
Hello.

646
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,310
Are you back to your senses?

647
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,350
Sorry.

648
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,040
Hina, I am sorry.

649
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,800
Please talk to me for a minute.

650
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,290
Even after I blocked you
on WhatsApp, you didn't get a hint.

651
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:29,180
Papa, please tell her
to talk to me.

652
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,530
What mom-dad?

653
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,980
It's between us.

654
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,410
Fine. [Sighs]

655
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,780
[Door closes]

656
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,650
I have decided I'll go to rehab.

657
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,940
Whatever.

658
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,980
You can do whatever you want,
we are through.

659
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,280
Don't say that.

660
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,280
If you don't support me,
then who will.

661
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,820
I am not a walking stick.

662
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,120
But before the marriage,
you promised me

663
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,450
that you will help me
beat this addiction.

664
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,940
And didn't I try?

665
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,570
You did.

666
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,430
Rishi, I made a lot of sacrifices
for this relationship.

667
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,420
I fought with my parents,
quit my career.

668
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,880
Now I am done.

669
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,320
You can leave.

670
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,460
Hina.

671
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,640
[Door opens]

672
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,600
Leave.

673
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,870
I'll be back.

674
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,650
[Door closes]

675
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,650
[Exhales deeply]

676
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,930
- [Himansh] Vandana.
- Yes.

677
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,490
- Why is there no water?
- [Laughing softly]

678
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,450
What's the matter?
Is something funny?

679
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,690
Vansh, go check what's
wrong with the water.

680
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,310
Because I am the only
useless person in this house.

681
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,630
[Himansh] Go quickly.

682
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,500
What's wrong with the water?

683
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,490
The management committee members

684
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,570
Nirmala and Gehi have told me
to sever the water connection

685
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,800
- to your house.
- Why?

686
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,350
Until your grandpa
doesn't apologize

687
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,910
to the Municipality Commission.

688
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,210
- Okay.
- You won't learn, will you?

689
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,550
- I'll get you fired.
- Boss...

690
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,480
You'll get me fired.

691
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,480
Nothing will happen.
Just get water supply back.

692
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,830
Papa is in the middle of his shave.
[Chuckles]

693
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,030
Thank you.

694
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,080
Guess what

695
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,840
the society members
severed our water connection

696
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,530
because grandpa is not apologizing.

697
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,830
Don't apologize.

698
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,760
Today they cut off our water supply

699
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,830
tomorrow it will
be our electricity.

700
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,410
Soon they will cut our throats.

701
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,350
Just say sorry to the Municipality.

702
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,470
Yes, Grandpa.

703
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,220
When helpless be
like Mahatma Gandhi.

704
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,410
Hey!

705
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,440
You would've never said such
a thing if you had seen Gandhiji.

706
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,060
Courage.

707
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,790
He was courage.

708
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,100
I will file a police complaint.

709
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,500
I will sue them for harassment.

710
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,740
I will make sure all of them
are put behind bars.

711
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,780
Papaji!

712
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,620
Papa, please don't do that.

713
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,050
Even Gandhiji never
got anyone arrested.

714
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,650
Your generation has
forgotten to revolt.

715
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,330
You guys have no zest. No zest.

716
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,170
One has to come down on
the streets to bring a revolution.

717
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,080
Posting on Twitter and Facebook
won't bring a revolution.

718
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,150
But the water is back.

719
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,840
Himansh, go take a bath.

720
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,830
Yes.

721
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,320
- Papa...
- Go and finish shaving.

722
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,770
Whose anger are you
venting on the bag?

723
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,810
- [Man chuckles]
- Hey!

724
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,090
- Wow...
- Congratulations.

725
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,280
You didn't invite me
to your wedding

726
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,450
but I found out through Facebook.

727
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,680
Everything happened
so quickly that...

728
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,330
I know, I know.

729
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,610
Calling your ex-boyfriend
to the wedding is a little awkward.

730
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,540
What are you doing here?

731
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,730
You moved to the suburbs
after the wedding.

732
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,000
Actually,
these days I am at my mom's place.

733
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,750
Wow! You're pregnant!

734
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,470
What?
No. Nothing like that!

735
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,850
Then you fought with your husband.

736
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,470
That's why you were...

737
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,880
Listen, it's nothing like that.

738
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,280
You're just over thinking.

739
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,690
You haven't changed at all.

740
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,580
You still can't lie.

741
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,060
And you're still nosy
and annoying like always.

742
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,270
[Laughs]

743
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,580
You know what, give me your number.

744
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,250
Let's catch up some time.

745
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,450
The ex-girlfriend
has marital issues.

746
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,570
Show her some sympathy,
a shoulder to cry on.

747
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,130
And then hook up with her.

748
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,870
- Right?
- Wow!

749
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,820
Seriously,
I haven't thought that far, but

750
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,780
do I still have chances
for hooking up?

751
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,110
One cup of coffee won't hurt.

752
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,280
Actually,
how can a cup of coffee hurt?

753
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,240
[Man] Right.

754
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,550
See you.

755
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,480
Bye.

756
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,260
I will call you.

757
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,280
[Woman] Pluto.

758
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,640
How are you, Mr. Gehi?
How are you?

759
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,830
Mrs. Mehta.

760

[Indistinct chatter]

761
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,960
He doesn't want to do anything.

762
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,000
Same here.

763
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,810
Mr. Holkar.

764
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,970
This Sethi family has
made things worse for us.

765
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,260
[Woman 2]
Whatever, but they must apologize.

767
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,050
Hello.

768
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,040
It's nothing, just one
of my neighbors. Forget it.

769
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,580
[Woman voiceover]
Please close the door.

770
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,870
[Himansh] The entire society
is boycotting us.

771
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,330
We cannot fight everyone, Vandana.

772
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,510
But who will explain papa?

773
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,980
What do we do?

774
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,470
Can I say something?

775
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,780
Let's invite everyone in
the society to our anniversary.

776
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,280
The entire society?

777
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,670
Do you know how much
that's going to cost?

778
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,280
Not the entire society?
Just the main guys.

779
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,220
Like Nirmala, the Secretary.

780
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,770
Motwani. Gehi. Srivastav.

781
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,520
Basically committee members.

782
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,490
But our anniversary is next month.

783
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,120
Wouldn't that be too late?

784
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,630
Let's celebrate in advance.

785
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,210
They don't remember
when is our anniversary.

786
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,150
Okay?

787
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,140
Yes, okay.

Okay.

Complete with booze,
kebabs, everything.

792
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,240
And your homemade yummy food.

793
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,540
Your food will calm down
their anger.

794
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,750
And things will be normal again.

795
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,120
[Kisses, laughs]

796
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,060
We did it last week too.

797
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,630
So... it's not like eating veggies
that we can eat only once a week.

798

[Both chuckling]

799

Tell me something.

800
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:49,140
Do you believe that our frequency
is anything like the other couples?

801
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,540
Not Mr. and Mrs. Motwani.

802
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,200
I see...

803
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,170
Have you noticed how
dry her hair has become?

804
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,320
And Mr. and Mrs. Gehi?

805
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,990
No chance.

806
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,930
That's why
they are so full of anger.

807
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,410
I am sure
they had sex last in 1983.

808
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,080

in the World Cup.

You do something.
Hold me properly.

I can even jump from the window.

we did for this party.

You want me to share a meal

00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,460
[Door closes]

884
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,250
[Vandana sniffs]

885
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,230
[Vandana] What?

886
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,540
Are you planning to keep it
on my head? Keep it in the fridge.

887
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,190
[Vansh] Poor papa.

888
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,540
Sometimes I feel bad for him.

889
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,150
I want to keep my hand on
his shoulder and say "Dad, Chill.

890
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,390
Let's roll a joint."

891
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,290
But he's an Indian father
after all

892
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,690
It will get scandalized.

893
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,040
[Door closes]

894
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,800
You know what, forget papa.

895
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,160
You go and apologize
to the Municipality.

896
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,920
Have you lost your mind?

897
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,750
Papa will never spare me for it.

898
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,850
But you don't have
to tell papa everything.

899
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,770
[Himansh] Hello, Karan.

900
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,900
Hello, Karan.

901
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,290
There's been a problem.

902
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,420
Hello. I've come down with viral.

903
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,570
I'll try to come to the office
after I recover.

904
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,820
Thank you.

905
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,290
[Himansh sighs deeply]

906
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,080
That was an award-winning
performance.

907
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,720
Why didn't you tell me before?

908
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,010
Even I would've tried in films.

909
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,330
[Vandana laughs]

910
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,330
What happened?

911
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,000
The society has added us
in the WhatsApp group as well.

912
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,960
Are you going somewhere?

913
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,740
Yes, I've to buy some stuff.

914
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,130
- I'll call you after the meeting.
- Yes.

915
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,250
All the best, Himansh.

916
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,410
[Himansh] Thank you.

917
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,790
I will note all that, don't worry.

918
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,860
I hope we're not late.

919
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,370
- Whom do you want to meet?
- Mr. Khairnar sir.

920
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,730
- Sign here.
- Yes.

921
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,760
One plus three.

922
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,670
- She said the second floor, right?
- Yes.

923
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,150
This is the first floor.

924
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,860
Come quickly.

925
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,960
Wonder where they are going?

926
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,770
Where are they going?

927
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,880
[Motwani] I keep dealing with these
government employees often.

928
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,320
No need to worry.

929
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,100
We'll have to grease his palms,
and everything will be set.

930
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,240
Okay, Mr. Motwani.

931
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,140
You're experienced with such things
so you will lead. Let him speak.

932
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,540
- Okay.
- You know what, Sethi sir

933
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,090
you just apologize
on behalf of the uncle.

934
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,860
- I will deal with the rest.
- That will be right.

935
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,860
[Woman] Vandana Sethi.

936
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,040
Yes.

937
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,530
Actually,
we're from the Kala Kruti Society.

938
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,830
The illegal building, right?

939
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,250
Sir, when we bought our homes,
we didn't know it was illegal.

940
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,830
Yes, we didn't know.

941
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,490
Did you have the building's
occupation certificate?

942
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,940
You didn't.

943
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,400
Your building had a permission
to build five floors.

944
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,050
But he built 7 floors instead.

945
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,700
Sir, we've been living
there for 22 years.

946
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,830
- Where will we go now?
- Right.

947
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,090
But I have orders from the court.

948
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,110
One of yous went to the court
to complain against us?

949
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,850
Sir, you see his father...
is an old man.

950
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,550
And you know, at this age...

951
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,510
Yes, sir. You know old age problem,
senior citizen. You know...

952
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,030
He's 80 years old.

953
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,430
- He was a freedom fighter.
- I see...

954
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,380
Whatever happened
was unintentional, sir.

955
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,520
Okay, forget it.

956
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:54,150
- Sorry. On behalf of my papa...
- Okay.

957
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,340
What do you guys want from me?

958
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,180
Sir, we wanted you
to consider this matter

959
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,190
and remove that demolition matter.

960
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:06,510
We'll sit somewhere
outside and discuss...

961
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,340
I didn't understand.

962
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,880
What do you mean by consider?

963
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,540
No... [Stammering]

964
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,890
I mean...

965
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,600
Sethi sir was saying...

966
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,870
What were you saying?

967
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,720
What? What was I saying?

968
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,380
He's not saying anything.

969
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,930
Motwani sir was saying it.

970
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,400
Yes, we were considering that...

971
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,800
Are you trying to bribe me?

972
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,730
Are you trying to bribe me?

973
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,120
Look, I will have you arrested.

974
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,460
There's a little misunderstanding.

975
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,930
No, no misunderstanding.

976
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,340
I understand everything.

977
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,110
Don't talk about compromise

978
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,740
adjustment,
or anything like that here.

979
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:45,360
See this,
this is an abnormal growth.

980
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,390
It's a cyst in the breast.

981
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,840
Now in order to find out
what kind of a tumor this is

982
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,180
we'll have to do a biopsy, okay?

983
00:46:55,270 --> 00:47:00,210
Sir, if the structure is illegal,
then it's the builder's fault.

984
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,510
Why are we being punished?

985
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,480
I see! Isn't it
your duty to find out

986
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,260
whether the builder
violated any rules or not?

987
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,840
The thief is to be blamed as much

988
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,040
as the guy who buys the
stolen goods. Understand?

989
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,860
Sir, the guy who buys stolen goods
is punished, and not the thief?

990
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,620
What kind of a Law is this?

991
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,480
The biopsy will determine whether
this tumor is benign or malignant.

992
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,410
If it's malignant,
then it's a breast cancer.

993
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,100
[Khairnar]
I have this court's order.

994
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,700
Demolition means demolition.

995
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,830
- Now you can go.
- Thank you.

996
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,590
Thank you, sir.

997
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,530
[Motwani]
And another important thing.

998
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,840
I've heard some rumors
about this MLA.

999
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:59,080
So no need to get too friendly.

1000
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,220
I mean maintain your distance.

1001
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:02,500
- Right.
- Okay?

1002
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,870
Sister-in-law Vandana,
where is Mr. Sethi?

1003
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,870
Himansh went to the office.

1004
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,820
He can't get a leave every day.

1005
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:09,900
It's all right.

1006
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,240
And Mona, cut down on your ruse,
your lipstick, please.

1007
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,430
- Why?
- Otherwise, how will we get that?

1008
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
Get what?

1009
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,710
- Sympathy.
- Yes.

1010
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,720
[All] Right. Right.

1011
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,230
We want the MLA's sympathy.

1012
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,650
- It's called sympathy.
- I know.

1013
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,750
And your earrings look too big.
Take it off.

1014
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,460
- It's too big.
- And your chain too.

1015
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,540
- Careful.
- Take it off.

1016
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,240
- That's better.
- Sister-in-law, you're perfect.

1017
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,180
We should look helpless and poor.

1018
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,200
- Can we all go now?
- Yes. Yes.

1019
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,650
You want help, don't you?

1020
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:41,540
Then we will help you.

1021
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,660
Let's find a way...
to stop the demolition.

1022
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:47,830
First of all, get a stay
order from the High court

1023
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,300
- for this demolition order.
- [Motwani] Yes.

1024
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,880
Have you appointed a good lawyer?

1025
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:53,580
[Holkar] No. Not yet.

1026
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,130
[MLA] Then appoint one.

1027
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,010
You must stop this demolition
in a legal way.

1028
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,620
And we'll do it our way.

1029
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,560
Sir, what do you mean by your way?

1030
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,650
Our party has done
so much work in your area.

1031
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,670
We fixed potholes,
installed street lights.

1032
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,020
We got rid of the slums and made
footpaths for your morning walks.

1033
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,540
We'll need a little donation
for all these good deeds.

1034
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,810
How much, sir?

1035
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,720
Yes, Motwani.

1036
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,120
2.5 million.
Where will we get that amount?

1037
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,240
Brother...

1038
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,900
I'll come back and talk to you.
I'm in a meeting right now.

1039
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,360
Yes. Thank you.

1040
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,290
- Straight from the office...
- Yes...

1041
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,060
- Water.
- Get some water.

1042
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,310
Sit, Brother.

1043
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,030
[Hriday clears throat]

1044
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:47,060
Yes, tell me.

1045
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,380
You see,
we want to send Vansh to America.

1046
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,420
And you know about the expenses.

1047
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,420
Dollar's rate is
at an all-time high.

1048
00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:00,930
Plus the Municipality's
served demolition notice.

1049
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,020
So... I am a little stressed.

1050
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,850
The matter is tight.

1051
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,480
I am thinking about
taking out a loan.

1052
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,910
Just tell me.

1053
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,560
You see, the bank guys
are always after me.

1054
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,350
They call up every day
insisting me to take a loan.

1055
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,780
But... I thought

1056
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,530
why don't I take
a loan from the bank

1057
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,440
and why not you?

1058
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,370
Instead of paying the
bank interest, I will pay you.

1059
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,510
Even you'll make a quick buck.

1060
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,430
And anyway,
you always have extra cash.

1061
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,440
So tell me what interest
you will charge.

1062
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:37,910
[Sighs]

1063
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,780
You know what, Brother?

1064
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,770
Why don't you take money
from the bank?

1065
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,870
And pay the interest as well.

1066
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,660
That will be better, right?

1067
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,210
I thought he's my brother.

1068
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:10,030
Not like the banks,
who take months to approve a loan.

1069
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,690
And then if there's
ever a problem with EMIs

1070
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,240
then I could've extended
the tenure.

1071
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,890
But no, he's worse than the banks.

1072
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,910
I was stupid who went
begging to him for a money.

1073
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,490
What are you looking at?

1074
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,480
Huh?

1075
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,070
Vandana.

1076
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,350
What is this?

1077
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,570
[Himansh] Don't worry.

1078
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,880
We'll deal with it.

1079
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,960
We've fought many battles in life.

1080
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,920
We'll fight this one too, and win.

1081
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,230
We'll get the best treatment.

1082
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,230
[Vandana sighs]

1083
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,070
The cost will be
around 1.5 million.

1084
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,130
Where will we get
that kind of money?

1085
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,120
We have FDs, PPFs (investments)!

1086
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,060
No, they are for sending
Vansh to America.

1087
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:30,380
We cannot send him
to America anyway.

1088
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,820
We need to save
some money for a home.

1089
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,050
What if we lose this home tomorrow.

1090
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,020
But Himansh, he wants to go.

1091
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:44,620
Those who can't afford America,
don't they do MBA?

1092
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,850
There are some very good
colleges in India as well.

1093
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,050
He can finish his MBA here.

1094
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,880
I am feeling very guilty.

1095
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,760
He will be heartbroken
because of me.

1096
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,250
You don't get everything in life.

1097
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,490
Vansh has to learn.

1098
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,190
Don't tell the children
about this just yet.

1099
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,620
They will be scared.

1100
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,750
We will tell them after
the test results, whatever it is.

1101
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,250
Remember your aunt's daughter.

1102
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:23,530
Why don't we take
a second opinion from her?

1103
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,590
She is a gynecologist.

1104
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,430
She is a doctor.

1105
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,330
[Vandana sighs]

1106
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:32,180
Himansh,

1107
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,820
I Googled it.

1108
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:43,540
There are only 30% chances
of surviving cancer.

1109
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,710
30% is a lot.

1110
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,780
Even if the chances are 0%,
I won't let anything happen to you.

1111
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,130
What is the bad news?

1112
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,240
Son, you know we love you.

1113
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:13,360
We try to fulfill Hina
and yours every need.

1114
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,160
We can't, because we have
some shortcomings of our own.

1115
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,230
Come to the point.

1116
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:21,970
Son, this house is in dispute now.

1117
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,100
The Municipality
isn't ready to listen.

1118
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,700
The future is very uncertain.

1119
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,880
So?

1120
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:34,040
We can't send you to America.

1121
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,690
What?

1122
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,440
Tomorrow if we have to move,
or change homes

1123
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,020
we need some money in the bank.

1124
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,610
But you promised me.

1125
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,260
We weren't facing
demolition back then, Vansh.

1126
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,040
I knew it.

1127
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,860
I knew you guys would do this.

1128
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,080
You don't love me.

1129
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,590
Uncle should've been
my father instead.

1130
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:53,690
Shut up!

1131
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,270
- You just shut up.
- What else can you do?

1132
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,330
You can ask me to shut up.

1133
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:00,120
There's nothing else you can do.

1134
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,740
You can't run a business
or earn money.

1135
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,100
All you have is a big ego
which you carry around everywhere.

1136
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,060
And this?
How much is this worth?

1137
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,630
2000 rupees.
[Laughs]

1138
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,530
These are fake.
They are fake.

1139
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,910
Real ones cost 10,000.

1140
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,290
10,000.

1141
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:22,290
- It's fake.
- [Door opens and closes]

1142
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,130
[Sighs]

1143
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,180
I already smoked two joints,
but I am still not high.

1144
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,050
Should I talk to dad?

1145
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,200
No. I know my dad's ego.

1146
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,740
If I take money from my uncle,
he will disown me.

1147
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,730
Even I don't want to go to America.

1148
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,210
I can't keep a maid there.

1149
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,090
And I will have to wash
and clean on my own.

1150
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:41,900
[Chuckles]

1151
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,720
You want to go to America,
but you can't afford it.

1152
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,490
My dad can afford it,
but I don't want to go.

1153
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:54,030
Life is a b***h. Unfair.

1154
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,500
Even Bill Gates said that.

1155
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,220
Hi.

1156
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,610
Hey.

1157
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,130
Can I click a picture of you guys?

1158
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,870
- No.
- Yeah, sure.

1159
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,470
You guys smoking weed.

1160
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,740
No.

1161
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,510
Enjoy.

1162
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,720
She was checking you out.

1163
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:16,140
And you're making faces like

1164
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,130
every other girl on Tinder
right swaps on your picture.

1165
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,310
She's going back to Kanpur.

1166
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:23,780
Why?

1167
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,630
She was a paying guest here,
couldn't find a job.

1168
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,880
- Oh, God!
- [Scoffs]

1169
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,220
Life's unfair.

1170
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,920
Bill Gates said it, I know.

1171

[Door opens]

1174
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,880
- [Hina] Hi.
- Hi.

1175
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,970
How bad is that?

1176
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,930
This.

1177
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,440
Two more weeks of bed rest.

1178
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,960
After that, I'll be ready
to stick my feet in others affair.

1179
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,590
[Hina chuckles]

1180
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,720
- Is this for me?
- Yeah, that's for you.

1181
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,750
Thank you, please come in.

1182

[Door closes]

1183
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,170
Wow...

1184
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:13,480
So finally you got
into fashion photography.

1185
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,830
I mean, I grew tired of telling you

1186
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,250
to get a commercial job,
make some money, make a career.

1187
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,140
- But you never listened to me.
- Hey. Hey.

1188
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,690
You're not my girlfriend anymore,
remember.

1189
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,130
Fair enough.

1190
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:28,320
So, what do you want to have?

1191
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,410
Red Wine.

1192
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,620
Do you still drink red wine
or you quit after marriage?

1193
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,730
I only changed my marital status,
not my taste.

1194
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,810
I see.

1195
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:38,660
But your taste in guys
changed before marriage.

1196
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:44,190
Otherwise compared to me,
interesting and that boring Rishi.

1197
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:45,600
[Hina chuckles]

1198
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,270
Listen, enough about me.

1199
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,270
You tell me about yourself.

1200
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,230
So what's happening?

1201
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,150
- Who are you dating these days?
- Me.

1202
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,580
After you walked out on me,
I went back to my first love.

1203
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,980
- And who is that?
- Photography.

1204
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,000
Listen, I won't drink.

1205
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:04,980
Why?

1206
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:07,660
Because after one drink
we'll discuss my marriage.

1207
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,440
And I really don't
want to get there.

1208
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,950
We won't discuss your marriage
even after four drinks.

1209
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,450
I promise you.

1210
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,370
Okay.

1211
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:28,870
Cheers.

1212
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,140
- You know what?
- [Man] What?

1213
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,220
What's worse than
being single and lonely?

1214
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,430
[Man] What?

1215
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,790
Being married and lonely.

1216
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:43,550
Marrying Rishi was
the biggest mistake of my life.

1217
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,450
I screwed my whole damn life.

1218
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,160
Fuck it.

1219
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,520
Shit happens.

1220
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,360
You made a mistake.

1221
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,640
So forget it.

1222
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,450
Don't keep him wrapped
around your finger.

1223
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,430
As in?

1224
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,110
As in...

1225
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,510
Give me your hand.

1226
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:07,940
You don't need him.

1227
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,450
Divorce him.

1228
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,090
Move on!

1229
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,460
And don't ever think you are alone.

1230
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:20,720
This is fine.

1231
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,200
[Man 1]
And what about the other file.

1232
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,420
[Woman 1] Wait, I'll give you.

1233
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:24,800

Congratulations.

1237
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,140
- But what's the good news?
- Good news?

1238
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,210
The good news is
that there's good news.

1239
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,090
- Wow.

1240
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,770

Yes, if all goes well.

1244
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:48,530
Brother Mohsin,
don't give her any stress.

1245
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,750
- And take care of her diet.
- Okay, I'll take care of her.

1246
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,310
[Mohsin chuckles]

1247
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,760
What are you guys doing here?

1248
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,630
We're here to see Dr. Kulkarni.

1249
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,520
Is everything all right?
All well?

1250
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:04,070
- Yeah, okay.

1251
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,950
- Yeah, okay.

- Bye.
- Bye.

1254
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,400
I feel something is wrong.

01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,710
- Why?
- I felt.

1256
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,530
I get dozens of
customers every day.

1257
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,880
Where will I get change?

1258
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:20,070
That's not my problem,
that's your problem.

1259
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,180
Madam, we don't get change

1260
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:22,290
- from the bank either these days.
- What happened?

1261
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,890
How much change can one guy carry?

1262
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,140
What happened?
Yes, I have, wait.

1263
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,720
Here you go, mister. Now go.

1264

- Thank you, madam.
- Thank you.

1265
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,300
Guess what,
I met your parents at the hospital.

1266
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,270
At the gynecologist.

1267
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,070
- Gynaec?
- Yeah.

1268
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,720
I asked them if everything is okay.

1269
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:37,910
They said yeah, everything fine.

1270
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,310
They were a bit nervous
and embarrassed.

1271
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,970
Why would they be embarrassed?

1272
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,490
Exactly.

1273
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,390
[Tongue clicks]

1274
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,790
These accidents
can happen at any age.

1275
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:54,260
- Chill. Relax.
- Hurry up!

1276
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,710
Okay I'm coming.

1277
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,260
See you later. Bye.

1278
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,060
You're out.

1279
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,620
You're out.
Why are you cheating?

1280
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,700
- You're out.
- You're cheating.

1281
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,870
Vansh, I need to speak to you.

1282
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,620
I don't want to talk, get lost.

1283
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,620
You're out.

1284
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,840
What?

1285
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,450
Mom and dad were at the gynaec.
Zulfiya just told me.

1286
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,010
Mom said they are going
over to Jyoti aunty's house.

1287
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,450
Mom is pregnant.
They went there for an abortion.

1288
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,820
Have you lost it?

1289
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,380
Do you know mom's age?

1290
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,400
If she can still have sex with dad,
then why can't she get pregnant.

1291
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,940
Yuck! You're talking
about my parents, okay?

1292
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,020
Our parents.

1293
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,530
And biologically
they can get pregnant.

1294
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:39,870
They can...

1295
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,240
I wonder how they didn't
get bored of each other yet?

1296
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:43,750
Maybe they love each other.

1297
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,320
- [Cell phone ringing]
- Not everyone is like you.

1298
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,430
It's Mom.

1299
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:48,720
Abhay.

1300
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,880
Please don't be judgmental.
We're just friends.

1301
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,220
Hello.

1302
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,520
[Door opens]

1303
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,770
I'll make a nice
cup of tea for you.

1304
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,700
No need, I'll make it.

1305
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,560
No, take rest.

1306
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,500
- How much rest...
- Mom.

1307
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:11,770
Yes, dear.

1308
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,730
What happened?

1309
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,320
Papa, it's okay.
Everyone makes mistakes.

1310
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,090
We are not kids anymore.
You both can tell us.

1311
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,220
What mistake?

1312
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,950
You tell us not to lie,
and you don't follow it yourself.

1313
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,190
If you had told us
that mom is pregnant

1314
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,030
then we wouldn't
have been so stressed.

1315
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,350
Bloody fool,
have you lost your mind?

1316
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,830
Then why did you two
secretly go to the hospital?

1317
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,870
Tell us.

1318
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:41,730
We went to see Manju aunty,
for a second opinion.

1319
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,980
A second opinion on what?

1320
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,010
The doctor's suspect...
breast cancer.

1321
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:51,960
Mom!

1322
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,020
They just suspecting,
nothing is confirmed.

1323
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,750
We just got a biopsy done,
and find out in two days.

1324
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,210
- I don't think it will be...
- Mom.

1325
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,300
- Don't worry.
- I am sorry.

1326
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,020
- No!
- I am sorry.

1327
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,170
We just got a biopsy, so...

1328
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,390
No need to be scared.

1329
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,880
Be strong. Himansh.

1330
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,320
Yes, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

1331
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,050
I'll get tea for all of you.

1332
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,250
Yes.

1333
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:17,980
No.

1334
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:19,800
Where is your grandpa?

1335
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,390
He's gone for a walk.

1336
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,480
Good. Don't tell him.

1337
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:24,810
He will be scared.

1338
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,010
Vandana.

1339
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,900
An emergency meeting
has been called.

1340
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,780
Look, friends, the total legal fees

1341
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:36,210
to defend this case in the high
court will be 1.2 million rupees.

1342
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:40,190
And 2.5 million
to the MLA separately.

1343
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,340
So in all, we need to
gather 4.5 million rupees.

1344
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,040
Four million.

1345
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,740
But how is it possible?

1346
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,080
Mr. Motwani,
what's the guarantee that

1347
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:53,300
the MLA will stop the demolition
after getting the money.

1348
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:56,000
We'll have to take that risk,
Mr. Srivastav.

1349
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:58,010
And anyway,
what other option do we have.

1350
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,980
The building has permission
only till 5th floor.

1351
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,060
And our flat is on the first floor.

1352
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,480
It's 100% legal,
so why should we pay?

1353
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:06,210
Please tell him.

1354
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,620
And I am selling my home,
why should I pay?

1355
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:11,130
And, I don't have that kind
of money. I can't afford it.

1356
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,800
Why are you wasting money
on another lawyer?

1357
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,060
I will defend this case for you.

1358
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,050
Please let it be, Mr. Sethi.

1359
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,540
You're the main
cause of this problem.

1360
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,170
You've already lost the case
in the session's court.

1361
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,450
So I don't think we can
give you any more chances.

1362
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,890
Uncle, no need to take the trouble.

1363
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,210
We'll arrange for a lawyer.

1364
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,350
The Sethi family is at fault here.

1365
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,710
So why we should
pay the legal fees?

1366
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,330
This is your mistake,
so you will pay the fees.

1367
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,100
We cannot afford this expense.

1368
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:38,600
[Indistinct chattering]

1369
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:42,680
Wait... Look, mister.

1370
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,090
Sooner or later
this matter would've come up.

1371
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,400
So how long will you
blame the Sethi family?

1372
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,260
This is not right.

1373
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:52,680
But...

1374
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,940
[Vansh] Even sorrows have levels.

1375
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,960
What was the biggest tragedy
of my life in the morning

1376
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,890
doesn't matter anymore.

1377
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:15,870
I can fight with mom

1378
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,180
argue with her,
stop talking to her.

1379
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,060
But I cannot live without her.

Yes, dear.

Will anything happen to me?

after chemotherapy.

have you made for tiffin?

1392

Rajma and fenugreek
leaves and potato vegetable.

do business of my own.

not want me to do anything.

all gents were the same.

1405
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:33,860
But even then I did cooking course
after much argument with him.

1406
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,300
Thank God for that.

1407
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:38,130
You did cooking course
so our lives were saved.

1408
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:41,610
Otherwise we'd have to beg after
shut down of father's business.

1409
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,100
We would have been in trouble.

1410
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,930
Sorry. [Chuckles]

1411
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:52,330
Vansh, you go to America.

1412
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,640
Mom, please. I am not
even thinking about America.

1413
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:58,520
No, but I am thinking.

1414
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:02,490
I did not get my family's support
so I could not become a chef.

1415
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,400
But you will get
your family's support.

1416
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,480
You go to America.

1417
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:10,240
Mission America is over. Okay?

1418
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:14,310
Why? Just because
we do not have money. Right?

1419
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,490
Don't worry. We will do something.
We will take a loan.

1420
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:21,640
Hierarchy of needs, Mother.
Hierarchy of needs.

1421
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,640
- What are you saying?
- [Chuckles]

1422
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,840
There was a man
named Abraham Maslow.

1423
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,520
He had said that basic needs are

1424
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:30,110
the most important
needs of a human being.

1425
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:35,100
Like food, clothing,
shelter and mother.

1426
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:39,760
Remaining needs like career,
America,

1427
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:43,090
clubbing, shopping dating
are required but later.

1428
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:48,410
So first we will sort out mother
and then we will sort out America.

1429
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,540
- Okay?
- Not okay.

1430
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:54,070
Don't sacrifice your future for me.

1431
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,580
What will I do of
my future without you?

1432
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,560
[Kisses, sniffs]

1433
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:05,640
[Kisses]

1434
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,590
[Bell dings]

1435
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,370
[Vansh] Everyone says
that during crisis

1436
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,740
one should have faith on God.

1437
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:25,190
But how do we keep?
God is not a doctor.

1438
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,700
But how can we keep faith
on doctor? Doctor is not God.

1439
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,100
[Landline ringing]

1440
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,640
[Woman] Vandana Sethi.

1441
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,210
May I come in, Doctor?

1442
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,590
[Male Doctor] Come.

1443
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,510
Sit down.

1444
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,030
Has everyone come with mother
taking a leave?

1445
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,950
It seems you all did
not sleep the entire night.

1446
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,550
Your biopsy reports have come.

1447
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,600
Reports are absolutely normal.
You do not have cancer.

1448
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,030
[Vandana Sighs]

1449
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:15,560
It is just a small tumor that
will get dissolved with medication.

1450
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,380
My child.

1451
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,990
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1452
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,430
If you don't mind may
I have the next appointment?

1453
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,650
Thank you, sir.

1454
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,050
[Doctor] Sister.

1455
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,920
- Thank you, doctor.
- [Doctor] Next patient, please.

1456
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,460
Tell me, madam.
What do you want us to make?

1457
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:32,880
An affidavit.

1458
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:35,000
Leave them and come here.

1459
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:36,430
Come. Sit down.

1460
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:38,480
Kalakriti Society.

1461
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:40,680
- The municipal one.
- Yes.

1462
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,160
It will be done.

1463
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:45,350
I will get such a stay order that
demolition will not take place.

1464
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,580
Thank God.

1465
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:50,440
- Stay there happily.
- Thank you. What is your fee?

1466
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,450
30,000 bucks.

1467
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:54,270
- For the entire case.
- [Chuckles]

1468
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,620
Per hearing. In about 10-12
hearings the case will be finished.

1469
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,270
Around 3-4 lakhs
of the entire case.

1470
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,700
What are you saying, sir?
Be a little reasonable, sir.

1471
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,730
Uncle holds great regard for you.

1472
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,660
I too have regards for
your uncle so I said 30,000 bucks.

1473
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:14,460
Best to best would be 28,000 bucks
per hearing. Is that okay?

1474
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:19,350
Sir, we have a budget of
one lakh for this entire case.

1475
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:23,650
We are middle class people. Our
society has only this much funds.

1476
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:26,940
Do you have funds
to pay for this tea?

1477
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:28,870
Or I will have to pay for it.

1478
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,890
That is not the case.
Look...

1479
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,690
[Gehi] What a strange man he is?

1480
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,690
- He is a very rude man.
- Very.

1481
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,090
- Uncle was right.
- Mannerless fellow.

1482
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,230
Hi. I am Rizwan. I am a lawyer.

1483
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,210
Shake hands.

1484
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,970
Greetings. Can I sit down?

1485
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,100
- Please.
- Please have a seat.

1486
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,520
- Thank you.
- We are finding a lawyer.

1487
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:53,870
I know everything.

1488
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,440
Kalakriti demolition,
municipality... I know everything.

1489
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:58,630
I know everything.

1490
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,730
I will fight the case for you.

1491
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,300
What is your fee?

1492
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:05,280
Don't worry. Pro bono.

1493
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,520
- Porno?
- [Laughs]

1494
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,410
Not porno but pro bono.

1495
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,120
That means free of cost.

1496
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:15,900
I will fight your case
and we will win.

1497
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,500
We will win and I promise.
Shake hands.

1498
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:19,930
[Rizwan chuckles]

1499
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,690
Rakesh, three coffees from my side.

1500
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:26,150
Could you now please give me
the detail of entire case?

1501
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:32,020
Yes. We were... 22 years ago
we bought this building.

1502
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,140
[Door opens]

1503
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:36,540
[Vansh] The favorite word
of Indians is 'Free'.

1504
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:39,750
Whether it is mobile data,
pirated films or lawyer.

1505
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,470
We want everything for free.

1506
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:43,870
With the arrival of
Rizwan a new ray of hope

1507
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,390
arose in the minds
of people of the society.

1508
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,560
He became the latest
celeb of the society.

1509
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:49,880
Everyone started
flattering his highness.

1510
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,750
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1511
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:58,590
Make her eat sweetmeat.

1512
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,530
[indistinct chatter]

1513
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,730
Whether it was Rizwan's magic
or Pawan Giri's good luck

1514
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:08,360
that after waiting for years
finally he got engaged.

1515
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,780
Now that mom's health was perfect

1516
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,680
then the signal for going to
America changed from red to green.

1517
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:18,200
Mom convinced father
to take loan from bank.

1518
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,710
I'll wait outside. All the best.

1519
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,820
Hi.

1520
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:27,890
Hi.

1521
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,150
Do you have money?

1522
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,800
I will not come to deposit it
in the bank.

1523
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,680
Buy a house as well.

1524
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:36,780
Don't mention about this
to anyone in society.

1525
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,580
Otherwise a complaint
will be filed against me again.

1526
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,780
Did anything happen?

1527
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,970
Something can happen only
when they allow it to happen.

1528
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:44,520
My landlord does not
allow my friends to come home.

1529
01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:46,490
The aunties of your building
pass sneaky comments

1530
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,850
if one wears a short
dress and goes down.

1531
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:52,090
If I get late then
your watchman also judges.

1532
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,260
And I thought I am from small town.

1533
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:57,390
Now I know why the government
wants to break your building.

1534
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,250
Because all of you are
so boring and narrow minded.

1535
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,460
All of them are not like that.

1536
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,050
But mostly they are of this sort.

1537
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,060
Did you get a job?

1538
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,930
Yes, finally.

1539
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,160
- Sani TV. Have you heard the name?
- [Tongue clicks]

1540
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,600
It is a very lame channel.
No one has heard the name.

1541
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,670
But at least I have the job.

1542
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:17,190
Yes. Sure.

1543
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:21,670
But how do you know
that I was finding a job?

1544
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:25,490
Just like that.
Neighborhood gossip.

1545
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,720
Did you get the visa for America?

1546
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,750
How do you know that
I am going to America?

1547
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,550
Neighborhood gossip.

1548
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,260
[Woman] Token number 10.

1549
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,650
That's me.

1550
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,620
Uh... Shall we hang out sometime?

1551
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:44,630
I am going to America.

1552
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,320
Can we hang out before
going to America?

1553
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:51,350
Yes, ma'am. [Clears throat]
Here.

1554
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:55,580
Ma'am, documents.

1555
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,590
[Woman] Which university?

1556
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,370
Washington School of Business.

1557
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,410
You have got a scholarship.

1558
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,520
Yes ma'am.
The entire tuition is waived off.

1559
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,050
I want loan for travel
and living expenses.

1560
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:17,110
The credit score
of Mr. Sethi is very low.

1561
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,280
What does credit score mean?

1562
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:24,250
Mr. Sethi made a default
twice on the last loan.

1563
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,980
Ma'am, maybe that time

1564
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,030
father was suffering
losses in business that time.

1565
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:32,780
Everything is normal now.

1566
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:35,220
There will not be a default now.

1567
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,870
Your building does not have an OC.

1568
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,670
We cannot pass the loan
on the surety of home

1569
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,090
till all the papers are legalized.

1570
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:48,940
Please take a look.
All other documents are sorted.

1571
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:51,440
What can I do?
Property papers are not clear.

1572
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:52,890
Credit score is low.

1573
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:56,050
There must be some way out, ma'am.
All the rest...

1574
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,340
There is no way out
without any security.

1575
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,120
I am so sorry.

1576
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,040
Token number 11, please.

1577
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:17,130
- What happened?
- They are rascals.

1578
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,730
They will give loans
to those who have crores

1579
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:20,970
but will not give it to us.

1580
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,330
Don't take tension.
We will try something else.

1581
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,570
Take this.

1582
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,630
I just cannot think about anything.

1583
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,130
Hi. Hi, Dad.

1584
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:34,690
- Sit.
- Hi, Uncle.

1585
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,580
Vansh, you too come along.

1586
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:37,810
No, Uncle, I will go by rickshaw.

1587
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,510
Your father will not scold
for dropping you home.

1588
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,450
- Come and sit.
- You never know about him.

1589
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,110
[Door opens and closes]

1590
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,790
- Thanks, Uncle.
- Wear the belt.

1591
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,290
I tried a lot but the
bank officials did not agree.

1592
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:54,960
No one can do anything
when luck does not favor you.

1593
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:56,390
Nikhil, you go to America.

1594
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,780
I will come to the airport
to bid you farewell.

1595
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,520
Keep quiet.
I will give you the money.

1596
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,850
No, Uncle. Leave it.

1597
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:07,390
If father comes to know
then he will thrash me.

1598
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,520
He will thrash you
only if he comes to know.

1599
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:13,370
Tell him that a friend gave
you a loan. The matter ends there.

1600
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,040
Do you want to
go to America or not?

1601
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,660
Come on smile.

1602
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,560
Smile.

1603
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,190
[Chuckles]

1604
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:27,980
By telling people we both
can make some improvement.

1605
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,830
- Hi, Aunty.
- Hello, Son.

1606
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,360
Shall I talk to mom in private?

1607
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,700
Yes. Okay then, bye.

1608
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:36,000
What is it?

1609
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:38,280
Uncle has given
for going to America.

1610
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:43,090
Have you gone mad?
You will create a fight at home.

1611
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:46,350
Mom, send me to America
but not on a guilt trip.

1612
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,010
When Himansh asked for it
then Hriday did not give.

1613
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,610
Okay he has given it now. Big deal.

1614
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:54,470
Papa will get upset.
He will not like it at all.

1615
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,300
Okay, his feelings are
important but now my future.

1616
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:01,770
What will I say? Who gave it?

1617
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:02,740
Jyoti aunty.

1618
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:08,110
Is my sister like a joker of cards?
You just fit her in any situation.

1619
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,490
Who else will give?

1620
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:13,380
No, no. If you put the cheque
in the bank then

1621
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:14,950
Himansh will come to know about it.

1622
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,090
Mom, I will put it
in my personal account.

1623
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:21,200
Father is not going
to check my bank statement.

1624
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:23,060
You are very smart.

1625
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:25,330
You have planned everything
before coming to me.

1626
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,870
- Mom.
- [Sighs]

1627
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:33,430
[Tongue clicks] Why are you
calling? First close the matter.

1628
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:37,720
Let me call Jyoti to tell
that she is giving money to you.

1629
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:39,790
- Let me take her in confidence.
- Mom, you are the best.

1630
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,370
I am not the best.
I will go in hell for you.

1631
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,570
Your son will go to America.

1632
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,310
Let her pick up the phone first.

1633
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,900
- Your Jyoti aunty is giving money.
- Yes.

1634
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:56,680
Your sister is very sweet.
She is always ready to help.

1635
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:58,140
Yes.

1636
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:02,810
- Whom are you calling?
- Jyoti. To thank her.

1637
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,340
She has gone to watch a movie.

1638
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:07,450
If you call in between
then it would be bad manners.

1639
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,220
Call her later. After two hours.

1640
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,400
Okay fine. But make
one thing very clear to her.

1641
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:18,080
We will pay back
her loan in 2-3 years.

1642
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,060
Yes, of course. We have taken the
loan so will surely pay it back.

1643
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:23,020
Yes. Give me.

1644
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:32,500
I had told you to let me first
talk to Jyoti and then tell father.

1645
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:35,250
- Why are you always in hurry?
- Mother India, chill.

1646
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,820
I could not get through
Jyoti's number so how can I chill.

1647
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:37,900
Everything is sorted out.

1648
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:40,130
- What has sorted?
- Sorted.

1649
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,470
I am sorted here.

1650
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:45,010
Pick up the phone.

1651
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:46,930
Everything will be done.
Come on let's eat food.

1652
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,590
How will everything be done?
I hope no problem comes up.

1653
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:52,760
Hey Birju, newspaper.

1654
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,360
Open Page3.

1655
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,550
[Boy] No, I did not take.

1656
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,390
Look at this.

1657
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:13,400
I had told you that
I would solve your problem.

1658
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,420
He is from opposition.

1659
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:18,890
He got the photo published
in press. He is playing politics.

1660
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,350
Sir, we did not know
about it at all.

1661
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,390
Then you should have
searched the internet.

1662
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,990
Then you would have come
to know that he is their area head.

1663
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,620
Search it on the internet.
Do whatever you wish to do.

1664
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:32,260
Look, my party just
wants to help you.

1665
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:35,060
[MLA] Why? Are you their relative?

1666
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:37,650
Opposition is using you.

1667
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,910
[Rizwan] These people from
government will neither help you

1668
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,140
nor let anyone help you.

1669
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:45,350
If anyone can help you
then it is just government.

1670
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,950
The government is ours.

1671
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:53,550
Listen, do not get
trapped in what MLA says.

1672
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,060
It is my job to do social work.

1673
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,120
I will save you. I will.

1674
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:01,270
Look sir, we do not need your help.

1675
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,500
We are simple people.
How can we understand our politics?

1676
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:09,830
- Sir, please leave this case.
- What?

1677
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:12,640
We will hire another lawyer.

1678
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:15,300
You all have very less time.

1679
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:18,370
Sheikh sir, please.

1680
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,250
Father had mentioned
to check background

1681
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:33,370
and then appoint lawyers.

1682
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,780
But you all did not listen.

1683
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:38,040
I am again late for office.
I shall leave now.

1684
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,310
[Woman]
Did you see the entire movie?

1685
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,870
- Good morning, Mr. Sethi.
- Good morning.

1686
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,370
Boss was asking for you.

1687
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,650
[Karan] Make it more presentable.

1688
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:49,340
Mr. Sethi.

1689
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,110
Good morning, Karan.

1690
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,420
How come you are in office today?

1691
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:56,500
The problem of the demolition
of our building is going on.

1692
01:21:57,110 --> 01:22:00,650
And then my wife's cyst
and the biopsy.

1693
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,630
Do you know Rosy
in the marketing team?

1694
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,800
Her divorce is going on.

1695
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:08,320
Sunil at the front desk.
His brother is in jail.

1696
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:11,080
In fact my girlfriend also
broke up with me last week.

1697
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:16,310
There are problems in everybody's
life but work is also important.

1698
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,700
Look, everyone is doing.

1699
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:20,050
It is good that
you came to office today.

1700
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:23,880
It will be very good if you
continue to come to office on time.

1701
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,130
Okay. Please.

1702
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:28,240
[Song playing]

1703
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:56,060
[Sighs deeply]

1704
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,070
[Cell phone ringing]

1705
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,310
There is no peace at all.

1706
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:18,500
Vandana.

1707
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:21,770
Vandana, your phone.

1708
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:23,540
[Vandana] I am taking a bath.

1709
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,790
[Song pauses]

1710
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:35,180
Hello, Jyoti.

1711
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:38,030
I am fine. How are you?

1712
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,670
I was about to call you
to thank you.

1713
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:48,780
Jyoti, thank you so much
for the loan that

1714
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,790
you have given Vansh for his fees.

1715
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:59,050
No.

1716
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:04,800
Okay, I will ask Vandana
to call you.

1717
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:09,040
Bye.

1718
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:22,820
[Himansh] Vansh, Vansh.

1719
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,050
Vansh.

1720
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:26,380
[Brij] Hey!

1721
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,430
- Did you take money from Hriday?
- [Brij] What happened?

1722
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,030
Did you take money
from Hriday or not?

1723
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,510
- Yes.
- Didn't you? Why did you lie?

1724
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:33,900
Why?

1725
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:35,100
Why are you screaming?

1726
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:37,870
- Dad, he took money from Hriday.
- So what?

1727
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,510
- It is a big deal for me.
- It is not his fault.

1728
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,290
- Even you are taking his side.
- Himansh...

1729
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:44,730
No. Come with me.

1730
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,890
- Come with me.
- Papa, but...

1731
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:48,910
Come.

1732
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,450
- [Brij] Why's he getting so angry?
- Calm down.

1733
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:52,590
- Why are you getting so angry?
- Come.

1734
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,830
[Brij] What has happened?

1735
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,880
- [Vandana] Your BP will increase.
- [Hina] Papa, please.

1736
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:57,160
- [Vandana] Listen to me.
- [Himansh] Come.

1737
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,770
- Papa, what...
- Calm down.

1738
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,390
Do not trouble me.

1739
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,720
[Door closes]

1740
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:07,950
What is the problem if I helped
him a little? He is my nephew.

1741
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,770
- It is a problem.
- What problem?

1742
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,820
The problem is that you are
disgracing me by instigating him.

1743
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:14,760
- You are playing a game with me.
- What game am I playing?

1744
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,630
You refused when
I asked money from you.

1745
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,390
How did you ask for money?

1746
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,710
- How did I ask it?
- I am your younger brother.

1747
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,360
Have I opened a bank here?

1748
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:23,690
You were irritating me
by continuously

1749
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:24,740
asking me to take interest.

1750
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:26,560
I do not need your money.
Vansh, return his money.

1751
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:29,620
Brother, because of your ego you
are spoiling the child's future.

1752
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:32,800
You worry about your child
and not of mine.

1753
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:34,630
- Vansh, return the money to him.
- [Hriday] Amazing.

1754
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,890
I will not return it, Father.

1755
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:38,000
What?

1756
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:39,230
Why should I return the money?

1757
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,530
He is not our neighbor but family.

1758
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,880
Who else but family helps
during such times?

1759
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:47,350
Son, there are certain
rules and values of life.

1760
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,550
- I do not have them, Father.
- But you are my son.

1761
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,000
But I am not like you.

1762
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,520
I will take help and
will go to the US. I have decided.

1763
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:00,660
Fine.

1764
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,830
Then do not ever come back.

1765
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,930
I will not back.
I don't want to come.

1766
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:11,260
Once I go to US
I will not even call.

1767
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:14,360
And I'll go with mom.

1768
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:18,200
- I am there for you.
- [Sniffs]

1769
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:22,310
[Man] Now your demolition
notice has come.

1770
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:27,090
You tell me if will you get
your daughter married in a family

1771
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:30,200
who do not have a house to live.

1772
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:32,320
That is fine.

1773
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,230
But if you could give it
a second thought.

1774
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:38,280
We are sorry for now.

1775
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,840
Uncle, you did not come
in flag hoisting ceremony.

1776
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,100
Who is winning?

1777
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:56,150
Who else but Sethi uncle.
Who else will win, Mr. Gehi?

1778
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,490
[Chuckles]

1779
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:58,970
What do you want?

1780
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:02,130
We all have taken a vow
on independence day.

1781
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,430
We want to be free
of the fear with

1782
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,540
which we are living
for the last 22 years.

1783
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:09,650
We will strongly
oppose the willfulness

1784
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,980
and dictatorship
of the municipality.

1785
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:15,040
We have come here to request you

1786
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,960
to please be our leader
in this fight.

1787
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,880
Today, you are giving me
a lot of respect.

1788
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,280
We have always respected you.

1789
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:25,630
That is why we want you
to fight in high court and win.

1790
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:27,380
We all are with you.

1791
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:30,290
Earlier you never respected Birju.

1792
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,180
Maybe they did not
get any other lawyer.

1793
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:36,280
If not now then when will
your experience be of any use?

1794
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:38,160
- Please take up this case.
- Yes.

1795
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,120
- We are like your children.
- Right.

1796
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,610
Set up my office
in the society office.

1797
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:47,440
Everything will happen
according to your wish, Uncle.

1798
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:50,700
On Monday we will file
a petition in High Court.

1799
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:53,650
- Be ready by 9 o'clock.
- Yes, yes. Sure, Uncle.

1800
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,530
Now can I finish my game?

1801
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:57,380
Yes sure.
Best of luck.

1802
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:58,830
Don't defeat him.

1803
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,660
- Okay, Uncle, thank you.
- We won.

1804
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:03,820
Here the municipality is defeated.

1805
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:05,360
[Man laughs]

1806
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:08,520
And now the builder is defeated.

1807
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:17,190
Today I have to file
a petition in High Court.

1808
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:20,010
I will try to get
the date for this month.

1809
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:23,130
- Best of luck.
- All the best, papa.

1810
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:26,880
- Mom, I am going. Bye.
- Have breakfast and then go.

1811
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,290
I will get late.
Okay I will take this.

1812
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:32,150
- Love you.
- Why are you getting nervous?

1813
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,720
You will surely get visa.
Hail to Lord Ganpati.

1814
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:41,120
Himansh...

1815
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:44,050
wish him.

1816
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:54,220
You will get it. Okay?

1817
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:57,790
Bye.

1818
01:28:58,150 --> 01:28:59,360
[Door closes]

1819
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,800
New look.
Are you going to see a girl?

1820
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:11,370
- Visa interview.
- Oh, nice.

1821
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,950
Saturday night
there is a play in Prithvi.

1822
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,920
I have heard it is nice.
Do you want to go?

1823
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,110
I am busy.

1824
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:20,100
Why do you act pricey all the time?

1825
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:23,310
Look, first there will be a play

1826
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:28,450
then movie, dinner,
drinks, kiss and sex.

1827
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:31,360
Then it will be time for me to go.

1828
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:33,980
Then emotional drama,
crying to stop me.

1829
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:35,420
Emotional blackmail.

1830
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:37,200
Who wants it, right?

1831
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:43,440
What an imagination you have? Wild.

1832
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:46,340
Thank God you did not imagine
our marriage and children.

1833
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:47,640
I am sorry.

1834
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,030
Your building is
about to be demolished

1835
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,430
and you are going to the US.

1836
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,240
They all have created
their own problem.

1837
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:57,580
And now they are trying
hard to solve this problem.

1838
01:29:58,330 --> 01:29:59,890
Offerings will be made.

1839
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:03,390
People will pray to God
that it is not in our hands

1840
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,090
so please come and make us
win this court case.

1841
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:06,570
And you have problem
with God as well.

1842
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:09,920
No, buddy. They are spending
so much on offerings and prayers.

1843
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:11,910
Instead of that if they
would have hired a good lawyer

1844
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,370
they would have won the case.

1845
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:14,920
Why are you taking tension?

1846
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,680
You will get another house on rent.

1847
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:19,130
Yes, of course.
Landlords are always keen

1848
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,930
to keep young and single girls.

1849
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:22,780
With such great difficulty
I found this house.

1850
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:23,870
How will I find it again?

1851
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,660
I am dying to be
single and mingle alone.

1852
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,700
You have such a great life. There's
no one to stop you. Full freedom.

1853
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:32,260
You should have the change.

1854
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:34,380
When it is my birthday
or I am having fever

1855
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:36,740
then I remember mom and dad
and not freedom.

1856
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:40,880
[Man chanting in Sanskrit]

1857
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:16,140
[Vansh] As and when
people got scared

1858
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,230
the people in the society started
showing a lot of faith in God.

1859
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:20,000
Not only in God.

1860
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:23,740
Everyone knew that only
one person can save them in court.

1861
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:26,830
Birju, will we win this case?

1862
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,480
My son will go and live in
his in-laws house with his family.

1863
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,940
He cannot take me there.

1864
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:37,190
If we lose

1865
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,950
then I will have to go to Uganda
to my son leaving Pluto.

1866
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,810
They are saying that
if we lose the case

1867
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,310
then the marriage
will get cancelled.

1868
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,910
If there is no house
then how will we have a baby?

1869
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,710
They will leave me
in this old age home.

1870
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:55,610
Don't worry.

1871
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:59,580
No one has the daring
to throw us out of our homes.

1872
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:01,830
Pluto will stay with his mother.

1873
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,230
We will win this case.

1874
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,130
You will get married. Don't worry.

1875
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:08,130
Mohsin and you will become parents.

1876
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:10,140
You have my word for it.
Stop worrying.

1877
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:11,640
Thank you.

1878

1879
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:33,920
[Exhales]

1880
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,770
Hey, I got it.

1881
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:50,670
I got my visa for America.

1882
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,110
- What?
- Yes.

1883
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,000
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

1884
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:57,370
Show it to me.
[Cheering]

1885
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,110
- Father, look at it.
- Congratulations.

1886
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,610
Thank you, Grandpa.

1887
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:03,270
Himansh, he has got the visa.

1888
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,730
That is amazing.
It is very good, amazing.

1889
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,130
Now I will just talk
to you in American accent.

1890
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,370
Okay, Mom.

1891
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,940
[All laughing]

1892
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:15,240
[Himansh clears throat]

1893
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:21,480
Papa, this case is
like world cup final.

1894
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,200
You are the last batsman
at the crease.

1895
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:28,710
You will have to hit
a century to win.

1896
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,000
Stop this cricket commentary

1897
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:32,900
and tell me clearly
what you want to say.

1898
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:34,970
Will we win this case?

1899
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:36,130
Do you have a doubt?

1900
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:38,330
I am a little nervous.

1901
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:42,210
Eat your food. [Clears throat]
Eat food.

1902
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:48,600
I was suggesting that
if another lawyer was consulted

1903
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:52,020
then the case would become stronger

1904
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:54,240
Don't you have confidence on me?

1905
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:57,270
I just have tension.
Like last time...

1906
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,860
Say it clearly that
you don't have confidence on me.

1907
01:34:00,950 --> 01:34:02,470
Last batsman...

1908
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,280
Why are you saying things
in such a twisted way?

1909
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:07,200
- Father, have food.
- I am no more hungry.

1910
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,950
[Sighs deeply]

1911
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:15,770
What was the need
to talk while eating?

1912
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:17,160
Those who do not have confidence
on themselves

1913
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,540
cannot have on others too.

1914
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:21,970
It is a matter of getting worried.

1915
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,590
And only those people worry
who are emotional.

1916
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:26,200
He will never understand.

1917
01:34:26,290 --> 01:34:29,050
Thank God I am not
emotional like him.

1918
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:30,290
Stop it, Vansh.

1919
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,420
Himansh, have food.

1920
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:36,120
Ask your dear son to eat food.
I don't want to eat it.

1921
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:37,890
Eat food. Don't do all this.

1922
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,010
Vansh.

1923
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:40,690
Himansh.

1924
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:42,380
- Himansh.
- Hmm!

1925
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,890
Till when will you both
go on with this drama?

1926
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:52,530
Vansh, apologize to father.

1927
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,820
Why should I apologize?

1928
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:55,970
Himansh, you are elder
to him so forgive him.

1929
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:57,930
- Let him apologize first.
- Say it.

1930
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:00,650
For what should I apologize?
What have I done?

1931
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:02,370
You always support him.

1932
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,390
He does not want to apologize.

1934
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:08,490
How long can a person
be angry with his son?

1935
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,750
I really need some fresh air.

1936
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:17,390
Where are you going now?

1937
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,540
I am going with my friends.
Please don't wait for me.

1938
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:20,820

Anyone can blast anytime.

1942
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,480
The house is no more a home
but has become a war zone.

1943
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:35,770
Shh! [Kisses]

1944
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:41,010
All efforts to rescue from
that war zone have started.

1945
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,050
How?

1946
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:46,460
Tan tan tan tana!

1947
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:52,250
With a divorce of Rishi and me.

1948
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:54,630
What the fuck is this?

1949
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:57,250
We had decided that
you would divorce him.

1950
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,100
I started the deal. Sign on it.

1951
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:01,780
We will get it signed
from Rishi as well.

1952
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:03,520
Then you are free. [Kisses]

1953
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:05,550
Not we but you had decided.

1954
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:09,540
[Sighs] You know I need some
sort of commitment.

1955
01:36:10,150 --> 01:36:14,090
I am not a spare part
that you can use temporary.

1956
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:16,410
I want a long term commitment.

1957
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,360
Abhay, try to understand
my situation.

1958
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,640
Everything is so complicated.

1959
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,000
I cannot give any commitment now.

1960
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,060
[Sighs]

1961
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:33,350
- I get it.
- What?

1962
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:36,840
Everyone in college was right in saying
that Hina is a gold digger.

1963
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:39,060
- What the f**k?
- It's true. Admit it.

1964
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:41,740
You dumped me and got
married to Rishi. Why?

1965
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:42,830
Just because he is fucking rich.

1966
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:45,400
- Shut up. Okay?
- He might remain f**k all

1967
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:48,620
and I maybe caring but
you will never leave him for me.

1968
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:50,400
Because love does
not give security.

1969
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:52,940
For that you need money.
Lots of f*****g money.

1970
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:54,420
F**k you, man.

1971
01:36:58,340 --> 01:36:59,390
[Door slams shut]

1972
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:02,410
F**k up. F**k, Rishi.

1973
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:04,020
F**k all of these boys.

1974
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,100
Focus on yourself in the time
that you have got.

1975
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:07,530
What should I focus now on?

1976
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:09,340
You were an amazing MC.

1977
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:10,690
With your hosting skill you would

1978
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:11,980
put the entire college
festival on fire.

1979
01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:14,350
You sacrificed a
good career for Rishi.

1980
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,220
Who will now give me a job of a MC?

1981
01:37:16,510 --> 01:37:17,990
Don't talk like losers.

1982
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:21,590
Did you try?
Call up event managers.

1983
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,910
Just get back into the game.

1984
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:26,920
Just be who you are.
You are kickass.

1985
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,770
I am elder to you
but you are intelligent.

1986
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:31,910
From childhood I am saying so.
[Chuckles]

1987
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:34,020
Shall we go home?

1988
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:37,350
For one more fighting round.

1989
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:39,720
Where do you want to stay?
On the footpath.

1990
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,060
Somehow we will have to stay there.

1991
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:48,540
Vansh, where is my coat?
I am getting late.

1992
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,770
[Himansh] Yes, Father.

1993
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:52,230
Here it is.

1994
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:59,800
You will surely
win this case, Father.

1995
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:03,440
I have more confidence in you
than in myself.

1996
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:17,120
I am getting late.

1997
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:23,390
[Man chanting in Sanskrit]

1998
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,390
Here also.

1999
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:46,630
- [Cheering, applauding]
- We will win this case.

2000
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,830
Your honor, I agree

2001
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:52,870
that illegal and
unauthorized construction

2002
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,640
is a grave offence
and should be punished.

2003
01:38:55,730 --> 01:38:59,560
But your honor,
those builders should be punished

2004
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:02,870
who constructed the building
going against the law.

2005
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,600
Action should be taken
against municipal officers

2006
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,970
because they did
not take action on time.

2007
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:10,870
That is why I feel the
decision of the session court

2008
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,640
is quite arbitrary
and it should be quashed.

2009
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:15,820
And we should be given a stay order

2010
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:17,980
against this impending demolition.

2011
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:20,040
Your honor, I request
the honorable court

2012
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:21,580
not to grant a stay order.

2013
01:39:21,970 --> 01:39:23,430
In last 22 years

2014
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,770
municipal corporation sent
show call notice many times.

2015
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:30,790
But neither the builder nor
the residents of Kalakriti society

2016
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,440
took it seriously.

2017
01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:34,650
That means
their intentions are malafide.

2018
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:37,830
Our intentions are
only to save ourselves.

2019
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:39,870
What is our fault, your honor?

2020
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,700
Your mistake is your negligence.

2021
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:45,170
I agree with you. All I ask is

2022
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:48,760
is the quantum of
punishment justified? Is it fair?

2023
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:51,580
There are old people, children

2024
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,580
and pregnant ladies
in this building.

2025
01:39:53,930 --> 01:39:57,420
Therefore all I ask of this
honorable court is compassion.

2026
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:59,830
Your honor,
if court starts showing compassion

2027
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,450
then no criminal will be punished.

2028
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:04,350
They are not criminals, your honor.
We are not criminals.

2029
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:07,380
It is quite clear
that who is a criminal.

2030
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:10,200
I once again, your honor,
beg to this honorable court

2031
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:13,600
to grant a stay order
on this pending demolition.

2032
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:17,480
So you agree that Kalakriti
society building is illegal.

2033
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:19,170
Your honor, I have told you that...

2034
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:20,440
Shh!

2035
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:24,560
If building is illegal
then demolition will take place.

2036
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:26,950
The order of the session
court will be maintained.

2037
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,950
The court gives
two months time

2038
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,290
to the residents of Kalakriti
society to vacate their homes.

2039
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:37,610
The court gives order
to Municipal Corporation

2040
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:40,790
to demolish Kalakriti society.

2041
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,520
Thank you, your honor.
Thank you.

2042
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,380
Okay, so we are starting
this new program under CSR.

2043

For people living
below the poverty line.

2044
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,620

I am thinking this department should be
headed by our very own Mr. Sethi.

Mr. Sethi. Mr. Sethi...

2049

- We are not done yet.

I have to leave.

- But the meeting's still going on.
- Sorry.

has given on time.

01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:10,590
There is shortage of it
in the entire city, Mr. Sethi.

2086
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,060
- How is that possible?
- Right.

2087
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:14,720
Ever since government
dropped the prices of stents

2088
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:16,250
distributors reduced supply.

2089
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:18,710
You mean, the patients suffer
in their tiff?

2090
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:19,810
What about grandpa?

2091
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:23,390
Look, we are trying to get
spare stents from other hospitals.

2092
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,930
But until then, we'll have to put
him on anti-platelet medication.

2093
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:28,530
And when we get the stents,
I'll let you know.

2094
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:30,740
Till then,
we'll shift him in the ward, okay?

2095
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:34,150
Hold on a minute.

2096
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:37,230
Um... Nikhil, call up
Batra Hospital and find out.

2097
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:40,940
Call your dad to speak
to his cardiologist.

2098
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:43,410
And you two, call up other
hospitals and find out.

2099
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:44,620
- Okay.
- Ashok.

2100
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:46,030
Father-in-law had a heart attack.

2101
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:49,220
- We're here.
- The cardiologist...

2102
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:50,500
Stent! Stent!

2103
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:52,170
Can you arrange it?

2104
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:54,850
- Listen to me.
- Stent?

2105
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:57,200
Do they have any spare...

2106
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:59,730
- And nobody picks up!
- [Hriday] Fine.

2107
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:01,650
This is why I hate this country.

2108
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:11,110
I even told my brother
as he's a heart specialist.

2109
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:11,880
Really?

2110
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:14,130
There are no stents available
even at his hospital.

2111
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:16,700
Give your father my regards.

2112
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:18,950
They tried very hard,
in the court.

2113
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:20,940
But the judge turned out
to be a rascal.

2114
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:22,450
I should get going.
Hriday must be waiting.

2115
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:23,440
[Vandana] Sure.

2116
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,750
Thanks.

2117
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:28,290
[Motwani] My husband
got really sick last night.

2118
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:30,440
- His BP shot up.
- Oh boy!

2119
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:33,380
I gave him two tablets
and finally he was better.

2120
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,730
The stress of the house, moreover
the BMC put up another notice.

2121
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:40,320
They'll come here in a few days
to disconnect power supply.

2122
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:42,600
What have you all decided?

2123
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,350
What will you do?
Where will you go?

2124
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:48,500
Chirag has been telling us
to go to him, to Toronto.

2125
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:53,150
But starting everything from square
one in a new place... Not possible!

2126
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,680
Tch! I know.

2127
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:58,950
Dear, you and Mohsin
should shift immediately.

2128
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:01,930
Stress is not good for you
in this state.

2129
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:02,850
Absolutely right.

2130
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,520
But Aunty, where do we shift to?

2131
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:07,430
We took a loan to buy this house.
We're still paying the EMI.

2132
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:09,890
Where do we get
a second home from?

2133
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:12,780
[Zulfiya sighs]

2134
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:14,190
- Vandana.
- Hmm?

2135
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,310
What did you decide?

2136
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:22,650
[Mrs. Motwani]
Okay, Aunty, we should get going.

2137
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:24,550
Okay, bye.

2138
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:26,790
- Take care, Zulfiya.
- [Door opens]

2139
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,870
Thanks.

2140
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:31,190
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

2141
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:32,660
Okay.

Vansh.

2145
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:48,300
Let's pack our bags.

2146
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:50,930
Come on.

2147
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:53,510
Get the suitcase down.

2148
01:46:54,130 --> 01:46:55,160
Coming.

[Machine beeping normally]

2151
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:09,230
Did they find stents?

2152
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:11,050
Doctors are trying.

2153
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:12,770
Okay.

2154
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,360
You should go.

2155
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:17,170
Sure?

2156
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:21,600
- Eat something.
- Sure.

2159
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,550
Are you okay, Dad?

2160
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:36,390
Dear, listen to me.
Among the two brothers

2161
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,510
you are the older one.

2162
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:44,970
Then act like one, okay?

2163
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:47,860
Swallow your anger.

2164
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,160
Hmm?

2165
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:53,670
Okay, Dad.

2166
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:57,000

Take the car. I...

2259
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:15,530
will come with Vansh.

2260
01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:26,610
[Himansh] In September, 2010

2261
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:31,330
I put a final lock here
on Sethi Travels.

2262
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:34,910
So today is like
an anniversary?

2263
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:39,790
I come here every year
on 23rd September.

2264
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:46,900
Every time I look at this shop,
I'm reminded of my past.

2265
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:52,040
That excitement, the chatter
of the many employees I had.

2266
01:52:52,430 --> 01:52:56,160
Day in and day out, talking
to the airline executives on call.

2267
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:59,680
Making package tours,
be it for Switzerland or Bangkok.

2268
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:03,350
Sethi Travels would be packed
with customers.

2269
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:06,740
Does mom know that you come here?

2270
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,110
Some pain is very personal.

2271
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:13,520
Then why are you
sharing with me?

2272
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,920
Since you're going to America.

2273
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:22,210
You made the right decision
of not returning the money.

2274
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:25,580
You are practical.
I wish I can ever be practical.

2275
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,390
It's okay, Dad.
You're fine.

2276
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:32,270
I could not modify
my business with time.

2277
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,440
So I started incurring losses
one after the other.

2278
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,460
I never let go of my staff.

2279
01:53:38,590 --> 01:53:40,310
Because they were family
for you, right?

2280
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:42,310
They were not just staff for you.

2281
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:46,760
These emotions bring you down.

2282
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:50,330
You are not emotional,
you'll do well in life.

2283
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:56,040
Take this. I deposited
a top-up of 2 lakh rupees in Forex.

2284
01:53:56,130 --> 01:53:57,470
No, Dad, this is not needed.
Uncle...

2285
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:59,570
I know he gave you money.

2286
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:02,550
But I'm your father.

2287
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:14,030
You are unbelievable!
You don't talk for a month and...

2288
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,580
then you make me emotional.

2289
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:27,280
[Cell phone ringing]

2290
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:52,660
You customized this?

2291
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,880
No, you get these with your name
on it in the market.

2292
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:55,850
Obvio!

2293

[Chuckles]

2294
01:54:57,930 --> 01:54:59,210
- Nice.
- Hey.

2295
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:01,250
I spoke to Epic Events.

2296
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:03,530
Most probably,
I'll have a gig this weekend.

2297
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:06,320
Thanks for pushing me.

2298
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:08,730
Well done, tiger!

2299
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:11,540
Okay, don't get too senti.
We're getting late, come.

2300
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,120
I'm senti?

2301
01:55:16,650 --> 01:55:17,830
[Tongue clicks]

2302
01:55:19,150 --> 01:55:22,270
Vansh!
Keep this box.

2303
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,110
- What is this?
- Thepla.

2304
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:27,320
Mom, the custom officers won't
allow this thinking it's smuggling.

2305
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:31,210
If they don't allow, eat it there.
Keep the box safely.

2306
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:33,430
Dad, it's locked.

2307
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:36,300
Yes, I'll put one more.
Many thefts happen at the airport.

2308
01:55:36,390 --> 01:55:38,570
What is there to steal in it?
Instant noodles and Thepla.

2309
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:39,750
Keep the keys safely.

2310
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:40,650
- Come, let's go.
- Shall we?

2311
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:43,160
One minute.
Himansh, water!

2312
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,700
Mom, I'll miss my flight.
What are you doing?

2313
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:54,430
[Vansh] Mom! Come on out now.

2314
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,960
[Hina] Come on, guys.
Selfie time.

2315
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:13,210
- One selfie together.
- Okay.

2316

Dear, you wanted to leave
without saying goodbye?

2319
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:24,020
No, Aunty.
I was looking for you.

2320
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:24,980
Really? [Chuckles]

2321

2322
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,710
Focus only on your studies.

2323
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,560
Don't worry about your parents.
We'll take care of them.

2324
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:32,780
And when you meet him
after two years

2325
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:34,570
he'll speak with an accent.

2326
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:36,430
And a hot blonde next to him.

2327
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,820
Just as my son did
once he went to Toronto.

right ahead.

At this hour?

It's the PM's visit today,
so they're clearing all of this.

is solved, I'll stay with you all.

in the next semester, I'll be...

Vansh, do you know
the value for money?

Is it more than
the value for family?

No, right?

- W-What...
- I didn't like it without you.

Huh?
How did that happen?

He's exactly like your son.

2404
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:13,480

that I'd never be like dad.

Well, guess what?
I'm his carbon copy!

2406
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:20,360
I'm the same from within
what I would call him.

2407

2408
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:28,860
[Man 1] I don't know
what's going to happen.

2409
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:34,380
Look, we have just two options.

2410
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:39,820
First, we vacate our houses and
hand over the keys to municipality.

2411
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:45,610
Or give a last try. Supreme court.

2412
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:48,500
We have already lost the case
in session court and high court.

2413
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:50,340
What can we do in Supreme court?

2414
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:55,020
I have one house and
we will do everything to save it.

2415
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:58,290
Just think that we will have
to go to Delhi again and again.

2416
02:01:58,380 --> 02:01:59,780
Hotel expenses will be incurred.

2417
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:02,340
We will have to pay lawyer's fees.
How will we manage it?

2418
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:04,420
The fees of Supreme court's
lawyers for one hearing

2419
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:07,020
is more than what
we earn in a year.

2420
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:09,500
Then should we buy another house.

2421
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:12,420
Mr. Bolkar, do we have
money to buy another house?

2422
02:02:12,580 --> 02:02:14,730
Mr. Bolkar's son
is in excise department.

2423
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:16,090
He will buy another house.

2424
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:18,290
What do you man to say?
Is my son corrupt?

2425
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:20,770
- How can you say this?
- Why are you saying this?

2426
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:22,860
What are you saying?

2427
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:24,810
This is not the time to fight.

2428
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:26,370
Mr. Aggarwal did
not have that intention.

2429
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:28,060
Can't we speak anything?

2430
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:29,980
Calm down.

2431
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:32,460
Calm down.

2432
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:36,540
Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex!

2433
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:39,620
Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex!

2434
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:41,660
Sex!

2435
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:45,140
- Vansh.
- [Vansh] They don't listen.

2436
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:47,300
Thank you.

2437
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:49,860
Thank you for your attention.

2438
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:51,540
Thank you.

2439
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:54,180
Will we get a solution
by fighting amongst ourselves?

2440
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:56,650
Look, the point is that

2441
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:59,220
nothing will happen by
just going to Supreme court.

2442
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:00,250
What does that mean?

2443
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:04,980
Aunty, why will court, government
and municipality listen to us?

2444
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:08,500
Neither we are vote bank
nor do we have any power.

2445
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:11,300
No one listens to a common man
in this country.

2446
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:14,980
But if we have public support

2447
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:17,780
then we have chance
to save our homes.

2448
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:20,660
Son, sit down.
It is not a child's play.

2449
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:24,500
Father, you all tried
but nothing happened.

2450
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:26,540
At least listen to
what he wants to say.

2451
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:29,460
- Vansh, you continue to speak.
- At least listen to him.

2452
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:31,460
- Come on, speak.
- Speak, Son.

2453
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:33,570
All I am saying is
that nothing happens

2454
02:03:33,660 --> 02:03:35,660
in this country
without public drama.

2455
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:38,700
Even in Nirbhaya case till
the public did not hit the road

2456
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:39,940
rape laws did not change.

2457
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:41,300
What should we do, buddy?

2458
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:43,330
Shall we do hunger
strike at Jantar Mantar?

2459
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:46,620
There are many other ways. We will
make our story reach to people.

2460
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:49,980
We will tell the entire country
as to what is happening with us.

2461
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:52,090
We will tell them that
whatever is happening with us

2462
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:53,580
can also happen with them.

2463
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:54,930
How will we do this?

2464
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:56,940
- Leave that on us.
- Yes.

2465
02:03:57,100 --> 02:04:01,890
We will shout so much that
they will have to listen to us.

2466
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:02,940
Yes.

2467
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:08,660
[Pawan] Vansh, don't let it fall.
My father will kill me.

2468
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:12,660
What a mess?

2469
02:04:15,140 --> 02:04:17,100
[Mohsin] They have made
this a Jurassic park.

2470
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:19,580
It looks like a government office.

2471
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:20,700
That's why
they're not able to do anything...

2472
02:04:26,060 --> 02:04:28,260
[Vansh] They have created the
problem so now we have to solve it.

2473
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:44,820
[Mohsin] Let's be positive.
We have to do it. Come on friends.

2474
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:52,940
Social media, TV coverage.
What else?

2475
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:56,660
Banners, pamphlets, newspapers.

2476
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:59,090
WhatsApp messages,
blogs, group messages,

2477
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:01,180
Street plays, newspaper fliers...

2478
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:03,380
[Woman 1] Who reads it nowadays?

2479
02:05:05,260 --> 02:05:08,220
How did '#MeToo' do so well? They
must have done something right.

2480
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:09,860
Of course.
Because men supported it. Simple.

2481
02:05:09,980 --> 02:05:12,210
- No, buddy.
- Men never supported it.

2482
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:13,770
[Vansh] It worked because it
was hard-hitting campaign.

2483
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:14,780
Hey guys.

2484
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:16,580
Hi, Vaibhav.

2485
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:18,580
Can I be of any help?

2486
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:21,260
Are you free today?
Did Mr. Bachchan leave you today?

2487
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:23,660
- Pawan, what are you doing?
- [Woman 2] What's up, Vaibhav?

2488
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:25,500
I am just like you guys.

2489
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:28,460
If this building breaks
then where will I go and stay?

2490
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:30,780
Even I am scared like you all.

2491
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:40,010
Vaibhav, just come.
We will help each other.

2492
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:40,850
Grab a chair.

2493
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:42,500
You will not fit
into one so get 10-12

2494
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:45,820
- We can use his tweeter followers.
- Exactly.

2495
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:47,660
How many tweeter
followers do you have?

2496
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:50,540
- 18,000
- That's it.

2497
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:52,010
Your attitude is like
that of having one million.

2498
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:54,220
[Vansh] He is already seven feet tall.
How much more will you pull him?

2499
02:05:54,340 --> 02:05:55,970
- Click a photograph first.
- Okay.

2500
02:05:56,060 --> 02:05:57,500
[Vaibhav] Guys,
please look serious.

2501
02:05:58,460 --> 02:06:01,260
- [Hina] Stop smiling.
- Actually.

2502
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:03,020
I think you should
use hash tag also.

2503
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:04,620
We do not have hash tag.

2504
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:05,970
Kala Kriti Society...

2505
02:06:06,060 --> 02:06:07,770
But what Kala Kriti society.

2506
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:09,010
Justice for Kala Kriti.

2507
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:10,940
- That is too high society.
- Justice...

2508
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:12,330
Bachao Kala Kriti.

2509
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:15,180
Bachao is too...
I know. It should be spunky.

2510
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:16,290
Hash tag KKS

2511
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:18,250
It is not a cricket team. KKS

2512
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:20,050
- Terrible.
- Save, save.

2513
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:22,260
Water is saved but not society.

2514
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:23,450
Save Kala Kriti Society,
it's good one.

2515
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:24,770
- It is good.
- Actually good one.

2516
02:06:24,860 --> 02:06:26,330
- Save Kala Kriti.
- Hash tag Save Kala Kriti.

2517
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:27,340
[Mohsin] Save it.

2518
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:28,610
It is a god stand, guys.

2519
02:06:28,700 --> 02:06:30,090
Yes. Save Kala Kriti.

2520
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:31,100
Not bad.

2521
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:33,180
[Woman 1]
Done. Let's have tea now.

2522
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,700
[Man 1 on TV] 23 children.
You are the hospital head.

2523
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:38,780
No TV channel covered our case.

2524
02:06:40,180 --> 02:06:42,290
- Any Retweets?
- Not really.

2525
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:45,300
We need a strong emotional
picture for our social media page.

2526
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:47,210
The demolition types.
Something like this.

2527
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:49,820
- No.
- No. We need a face.

2528
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:53,740
A sad face whose house
is being demolished.

2529
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:55,330
Drama, you like that.

2530
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:56,730
[Man 2 on TV]
Concerned doctor? 

2531
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:58,860
23 children. What will you tell
to their parents?

2532
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:00,410
The concerned doctor
has been arrested.

2533
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:01,860
So callus is your answer.

2534
02:07:02,180 --> 02:07:03,570
If we come on the
channel of this person

2535
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:05,300
then we will trend
in the entire nation.

2536
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:07,060
[Man 1 on TV]
Chief minister himself...

2537
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:08,330
Do you have his number?

2538
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:09,260
I can find it.

2539
02:07:09,460 --> 02:07:12,170
Oh shit. I got to go, guys.

2540
02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:13,090
Where?

2541
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:14,660
I have my first gig.

2542
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:17,170
- Be successful.
- All the best.

2543
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:18,340
Bye.

2544
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:20,700
How is this one?

2545
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:22,620
- No, buddy. What is this?
- Show me.

2546
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:24,860
Hey, I have an idea.

2547
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:28,380
Let's put his photograph. He seems
to be like a refugee these days.

2548
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:31,140
Very funny. You will understand
when your engagement will break.

2549
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:32,490
- Aww!
- [Smooches]

2550
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:33,540
What about this?

2551
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:37,300
It is great.

2552
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:39,900
- Vansh, no.
- Why?

2553
02:07:40,180 --> 02:07:42,530
- It is picture of Syrian war.
- I know.

2554
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:44,180
Because it is unethical.

2555
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:45,330
There is full emotion in it.

2556
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:46,340
Do whatever you want to.
I don't care.

2557
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:48,330
Are we saving our homes
or becoming ethical?

2558
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:49,900
Like it or not? I like it.

2559
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:51,410
- I vote for it.
- Me too.

2560
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:52,740
What do you guys say?

2561
02:07:53,620 --> 02:07:54,620
[Vaibhav] I am up for it.

2562
02:07:55,580 --> 02:07:57,220
- Sorry.
- Unbelievable.

2563
02:07:57,980 --> 02:08:00,860
Majority wins.
It is a good picture. It will work.

2564
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:03,100
[Yawning]

2565
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:05,500
[Sighs]

2566
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:09,460
Oh.

2567
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:16,890
Hello, Himansh,
Hina has not come back yet.

2568
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:18,140
It is 1 o'clock.

2569
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:21,530
I tried.
The phone is not reachable.

2570
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:22,860
[Door opens]

2571
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:25,460
She has come. Go to sleep, Himansh.

2572
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:27,660
Hina, you are so late.

2573
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,260
[Both laugh]

2574
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:32,940
- Was it good?
- It was very, very good.

2575
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:35,860
10,000 bucks.

2576
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:37,540
10,000 bucks.

2577
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:39,620
For you.

2578
02:08:40,620 --> 02:08:41,570
It is yours. So keep it.

2579
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:43,780
Mummy, keep it.

2580
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:45,690
[Chuckles]

2581
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:46,860
Oh God.

2582
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:51,580
You know I had forgotten that
I enjoy anchoring so much.

2583
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:53,210
- Did you eat food?
- Yes.

2584
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:54,560
Do you know that

2585
02:08:54,650 --> 02:08:57,570
they have promised me
to give me another gig next month.

2586
02:08:57,660 --> 02:08:59,100
I am so excited.

2587
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:02,530
I am calling since morning.

2588
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:04,940
Please make me talk
to Somen Chatterjee once.

2589
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:06,940
Just once.
Just for two minutes. That's all.

2590
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:08,940
Hello.

2591
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:10,660
Hello.

2592
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:13,020
What the f**k.

2593
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:14,570
What happened?

2594
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:16,010
Nothing. I am trying from landline

2595
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:17,340
and still they are
disconnecting the phone.

2596
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:20,140
Am I selling credit card? They
disconnect the phone so easily.

2597
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:21,660
[Man 1] Call up the secretary.

2598
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:24,460
I am calling the secretary itself,
Who else am I talking to?

2599
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:28,300
You are just playing carom there.
Do some work?

2600
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:29,870
The problem is

2601
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:31,900
that people like Somen
think themselves to be Shah Rukh.

2602
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:33,580
Our parents are the problem

2603
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:36,220
who decided to buy
this house 22 years ago.

2604
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:38,770
And today we are in trouble.

2605
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:40,250
We do not go on a date

2606
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:41,900
without searching
about the girl on internet.

2607
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:43,940
And they bought a house.

2608
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:46,940
We should sue our parents
for ruining our future.

2609
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:49,010
- I will get a lawyer for free.
- [Cell phone ringing]

2610
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:50,660
Put few more extra
sections from my side.

2611
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:53,900
Yes, Mom. Okay, fine.

2612
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:57,860
Hey, your drunkard
has come with his father.

2613
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:03,700
[Harish] Rishi was staying in rehab
for last 2 months.

2614
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:06,220
Now he does not touch alcohol.

2615
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:08,980
He has thrown the entire
stock that was at home.

2616
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:13,100
I asked him to keep some for me.

2617
02:10:13,460 --> 02:10:15,170
[laughs]

2618
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:18,100
It's all good now. Come home now.

2619
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:25,860
- I want divorce.
- What?

2620
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:28,500
Please give another chance.

2621
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:31,500
Look, dear,
marriage is not like a job.

2622
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:33,580
That you do it today
and leave it tomorrow.

2623
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:35,500
Himansh, make her understand.

2624
02:10:35,620 --> 02:10:38,740
This is my decision.
What will he explain to me?

2625
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:42,380
I am sorry.
I promise I will never drink again.

2626
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:46,180
They are young.
They do not have experience.

2627
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:48,980
We are elder to them so
we should make them understand.

2628
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:49,970
Yes.

2629
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:50,860
Vandana.

2630
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:54,370
If she is saying so then

2631
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:56,660
she must have said it
after giving it a thought.

2632
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:59,860
[Harish] Your daughter is talking
about breaking the marriage

2633
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:01,740
and you are not saying anything.

2634
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:03,100
What kind of a father are you?

2635
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:06,420
Mr. Harish, if I was
a dominating father

2636
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:10,420
then I would have never
let Hina marry Rishi.

2637
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:13,530
Let's go, Rishi.

2638
02:11:13,620 --> 02:11:15,940
Dad, wait. Let me talk to her.

2639
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:18,300
If I talk to her
then she will agree.

2640
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:20,820
Rishi, we are leaving now. Come on.

2641
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:24,860
[Chuckles softly] Bye.

2642
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:31,940
[Door opens]

2643
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:34,780
Hi, Uncle. Snacks?

2644
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:37,980
I have been insulted
so I am not hungry.

2645
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:39,740
Make them eat the snacks.?

2646
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:49,420
[Door closes]

2647
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:53,740
[Chuckles softly]

2648
02:11:56,020 --> 02:11:57,100
Papa, snacks.

2649
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:00,380
I will keep them inside.

2650
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:04,420
Life changes a lot after marriage.

2651
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:06,780
Isn't it? But no one tells.

2652
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:08,500
Look at me.

2653
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:11,300
I don't understand that
what has happened with me.

2654
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:12,940
We will not get abortion done.

2655
02:12:13,620 --> 02:12:15,700
What will we do then? Will
we sleep with the child at home?

2656
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:17,660
We will stay on rent.

2657
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:18,780
Okay calculate.

2658
02:12:19,940 --> 02:12:22,500
The rent of the new house,
EMI of this house

2659
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:26,140
hospital expenses,
medicines, salary of the maid.

2660
02:12:26,700 --> 02:12:29,900
And I will have to take
maternity leave for a year.

2661
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:32,780
There will be many expenses
and the salary will be only yours.

2662
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:35,300
How can we afford a child?

2663
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:40,380
Everything is so
uncertain right now.

2664
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:43,500
How can we bring another
life in this world?

2665
02:12:43,780 --> 02:12:45,380
Into this chaos.

2666
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:47,860
See, this is the
situation right now.

2667
02:12:48,060 --> 02:12:49,540
What if the situation changes?

2668
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:50,620
What do you mean?

2669
02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:52,140
What if our house is saved?

2670
02:12:52,820 --> 02:12:54,860
The society is making
an appeal in the Supreme Court.

2671
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:57,090
That will take time.

2672
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:58,420
We have the time.

2673
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:01,620
It is only 10th week now.
We can wait for a month or two.

2674
02:13:03,940 --> 02:13:06,980
Okay, we will wait for 1-2 months.

2675
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:11,540
What if the Supreme Court
still gives the same verdict?

2676
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:12,930
What's up guys?

2677
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:14,290
Oh!

2678
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:16,410
Now we have come. We will
not go even if you ask us to leave.

2679
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:18,100
- Correct.
- No chance.

2680
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:19,900
What are you guys having?
Everything is empty here.

2681
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:22,060
We are having a conversation.

2682
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:24,540
Intense. At least you drink.

2683
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:27,650
Hello Mr. Chatterjee.
Come this way.

2684
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:28,940
I have a table reserved for you.

2685
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:34,330
I will catch hold of him now.

2686
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:37,050
No, Vansh, this is not
the right place to talk.

2687
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:38,220
Don't listen to him.

2688
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:40,370
Desperate times call
for desperate value. You go.

2689
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:42,060
- Come on go.
- Don't. Don't.

2690
02:13:44,020 --> 02:13:45,180
Hi, guys.

2691
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:47,860
Good evening.

2692
02:13:48,380 --> 02:13:50,140
Hi. Hope you are having fun.

2693
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:54,780
Few days ago I found Alladdin's
lamp and I rubbed it.

2694
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:59,580
And Gini came out and asked me
as to what I want.

2695
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:02,340
Do you want a Ferrari car?

2696
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:05,980
I replied, "Hey brother, 28% GST

2697
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:09,170
80/-per liter petrol...
Are you mad?"

2698
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:10,660
[Laughter]

2699
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:18,540
Gini told me to take 100 million
dollars loan with no interest.

2700
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:19,690
I said not possible.

2701
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:21,490
If I take loan then I'll
have to leave the country.

2702
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:23,330
[Laughter]

2703
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:24,660
I love this country.

2704
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:28,820
Gini asked me as to what I wanted.

2705
02:14:29,540 --> 02:14:34,300
I told him to get me
a 2 BHK flat in Mumbai.

2706
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:37,700
He looked into my eyes

2707
02:14:39,140 --> 02:14:42,860
and said that if I had a flat
then would I be staying in a lamp.

2708
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:44,660
[Laughter]

2709
02:14:46,900 --> 02:14:51,500
This is not a joke. But a reality.

2710
02:14:52,540 --> 02:14:56,370
My house, our house
where our family stays

2711
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:57,580
is about to be demolished.

2712
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:00,980
For last 22 years we
are staying in that house.

2713
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:03,580
I was born in that house.

2714
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:06,140
But now that house is...

2715
02:15:07,540 --> 02:15:08,330
why?

2716
02:15:08,420 --> 02:15:12,580
Because the government has
declared that the building is illegal.

2717
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:18,140
If someone knows about a good
footpath or flyover then tell me.

2718
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:20,180
Not under construction.
Ready to move in.

2719
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:21,250
We do not have time.

2720
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:25,700
Low maintenance, free parking. View
should be good. View is important.

2721
02:15:26,620 --> 02:15:30,930
If you cannot help us
to buy new houses

2722
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:34,060
then at least help us
to save our existing houses.

2723
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:36,860
Especially you,
Mr. Somen Chatterjee.

2724
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:40,220
You are Gini and we are Aladdin.

2725
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:44,340
Our voice needs your loud speaker.

2726
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:49,290
Please sir, if you could
raise this issue on your channel

2727
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:51,300
then it'd be a great help.

2728
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:55,020
That would really help us, sir.

2729
02:15:57,700 --> 02:15:58,650
If you guys want to help us

2730
02:15:58,740 --> 02:16:01,650
then you can also go on
social media and like our page.

2731
02:16:01,740 --> 02:16:04,090
It is called hashtag
Save Kala Kriti.

2732
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:08,700
Maybe your likes
will save our homes.

2733
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:14,980
That's it. Thank you, guys.

2734
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:17,420
[Applauding]

2735
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:22,020
Wait, wait! That was not bad.

2736
02:16:23,260 --> 02:16:24,460
- Thank you.
- What is your name?

2737
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:25,620
Vansh Sethi.

2738
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:27,940
- Whatever you said is true. Is it?
- of course.

2739
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:30,730
Do one thing. You take
my card and call my secretary.

2740
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:32,740
Maybe we can do a debate
on this topic.

2741
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:35,620
I am not promising anything.
It may or may not happen. But...

2742
02:16:37,460 --> 02:16:39,220
Mann Ki Baat...

2743
02:16:46,580 --> 02:16:47,900
You did it.

2744
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:51,260
Why didn't they take
you for the interview?

2745
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:52,700
You also wanted to appear on the show.

2746
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:55,260
Motwani will handle everything.

2747
02:16:56,060 --> 02:16:56,940
Vandana.

2748
02:16:57,420 --> 02:16:59,820
[Somen on TV] Good evening and
welcome to 9 o'clock debate.

2749
02:17:00,140 --> 02:17:02,940
Today we are focusing on illegal
constructions across our cities.

2750
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:05,500
Hello, Rohit,
Can you stream News Studio channel in Canada?

2751
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:07,100
Your father is going to be on TV.

2752
02:17:07,220 --> 02:17:08,860
...on the Kala Kriti
Housing society.

2753
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:10,100
The housing society...

2754
02:17:10,220 --> 02:17:11,900
- Increase the volume.
- ...is in trouble.

2755
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:16,380
We have with us Vansh Sethi,
Mr. Mukul Motwani.

2756
02:17:16,580 --> 02:17:18,460
- Should've worn a better T-shirt.
- [Vansh] Thank you.

2757
02:17:18,660 --> 02:17:22,540
The high court has declared
that your society is illegal.

2758
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:25,180
There is an eviction notice.
What is the problem?

2759
02:17:25,380 --> 02:17:28,250
The problem is that
we have bought these houses

2760
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:30,610
I mean our parents have bought
these houses

2761
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:31,860
with hard earned money.

2762
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:34,370
But everyone buys houses
with hard earned money.

2763
02:17:34,460 --> 02:17:36,020
That can't be an excuse.

2764
02:17:36,420 --> 02:17:37,620
Yes, it's not an excuse.

2765
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:41,140
Over 20-22 years, these families
have been living here.

2766
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:44,610
Suddenly there is a notice
and we are asked to leave.

2767
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:47,780
But does that mean that
they can avoid justice?

2768
02:17:47,900 --> 02:17:49,020
- No.
- Brother,

2769
02:17:49,140 --> 02:17:50,500
actually we are saying that

2770
02:17:51,060 --> 02:17:53,410
- this is injustice.
- It's injustice?

2771
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:56,620
Yes. I mean we are honest citizens.

2772
02:17:57,180 --> 02:17:58,260
We are paying our taxes on time.

2773
02:17:58,380 --> 02:17:59,730
- [Somen laughing]
- All. Everything.

2774
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:01,420
Sorry what did you say?

2775
02:18:01,540 --> 02:18:03,740
- We are paying our taxes on time.
- Before that.

2776
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:04,940
- Before that.
- Yes.

2777
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:06,580
Honest citizens.

2778
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:09,180
- [Laughs] Honest citizens.
- [Mukul] Yes.

2779
02:18:09,300 --> 02:18:10,140
Really?

2780
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:14,100
I would like to request
my producer to put up a photo

2781
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:17,700
of this housing society.
Social media page please.

2782
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:20,980
Viewers, focus on the photograph
of the social media page.

2783
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:24,740
The photo they have
is of Syrian Civil war.

2784
02:18:25,220 --> 02:18:27,140
Is this your social media page?

2785
02:18:27,260 --> 02:18:29,500
Hashtag, Save Kala Kriti Society.

2786
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:33,850
Do you use a photograph
from a war torn country

2787
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:36,660
and trying to pass it
out as photo of your society?

2788
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:39,250
We are not trying to say...

2789
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:40,780
Aren't you ashamed?

2790
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:43,020
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

2791
02:18:43,980 --> 02:18:45,980
To manipulate the public like that

2792
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:48,850
into sympathizing with your cause.

2793
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:50,940
which by the way is wrongful
in the first place.

2794
02:18:51,060 --> 02:18:53,370
Sir, we are not
trying to manipulate.

2795
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:54,570
No, one second.

2796
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:58,140
What I am saying is that
if you have done something illegal

2797
02:18:58,300 --> 02:18:59,410
then you should suffer for it.

2798
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:02,820
Which is why I am
starting a new hash tag

2799
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:06,460
and my hash tag is Demolish
Kala Kriti Society.

2800
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:10,170
Not save Kala Kriti society
which is what these people want.

2801
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:11,210
By doing things illegal.

2802
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:14,740
I am saying hashtag
Demolish Kala Kriti Society.

2803
02:19:14,900 --> 02:19:16,690
- Break down this society.
- Oh God.

2804
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:18,580
We have not done anything illegal.

2805
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:19,980
Don't interrupt me.

2806
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:22,930
Please send me
your tweets and opinions

2807
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:25,820
on hashtag Demolish
Kala Kriti Society.

2808
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:28,500
I will see you after the break.

2809
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:31,090
Brother, you've got to understand
our point of view.

2810
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:32,850
We are not trying
to mislead anybody.

2811
02:19:32,940 --> 02:19:36,220
- We came here for public support.
- Yes, I am with your cause.

2812
02:19:36,340 --> 02:19:38,010
- No, but you did not...
- We have to speak in debate.

2813
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:40,330
It is not even our fault, sir.

2814
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:45,220
The FSI gave permission
to builder for five floors.

2815
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:48,610
The builder
ended up making 7 floors.

2816
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:50,700
So the builder has done
something illegal.

2817
02:19:50,820 --> 02:19:51,500
Yes.

2818
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:53,380
- You guys are innocent.
- Correct.

2819
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:55,500
[Man 1]
We are going live in 5 seconds.

2820
02:19:55,860 --> 02:19:57,060
- 5.
- I'll tell.

2821
02:19:57,180 --> 02:19:59,300
[Man 1] 4, 3...

2822
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:02,500
Welcome back from the break.

2823
02:20:02,620 --> 02:20:05,970
We are discussing the issue of
the illegal Kala Kriti society.

2824
02:20:06,060 --> 02:20:09,050
And I asked about your tweets
and opinions on this issue.

2825
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:11,180
And we have got literally
hundreds of tweets.

2826
02:20:11,300 --> 02:20:14,130
The first one is from Purohit 2016.

2827
02:20:14,220 --> 02:20:16,940
And Mr. Purohit says
if they are criminals

2828
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:18,970
then they should
suffer like criminals.

2829
02:20:19,060 --> 02:20:20,980
- Sir, we are not criminals.
- Don't interrupt.

2830
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:22,860
I completely agree with that.

2831
02:20:22,980 --> 02:20:24,780
If you have done something criminal

2832
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:26,300
then you have to face the law.

2833
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:28,260
And we have got other tweets
as well coming in.

2834
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:30,410
Demolish Kala Kriti
Society is trending, guys.

2835
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:34,020
He says that
they should get no respite.

2836
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:36,740
I agree with them.
No respite for them.

2837
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:39,340
They should face
full force of the law.

2838
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:41,970
I think that is what
India is saying today.

2839
02:20:42,060 --> 02:20:43,940
And I hear you loud and clear.

2840
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:46,100
Thank you for joining
me on this debate.

2841
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:49,570
Coming after right after
the break another debate.

2842
02:20:49,660 --> 02:20:51,060
This time we discuss

2843
02:20:58,020 --> 02:20:59,460
I will see you after the break.

2844
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:01,770
[Vansh sighs deeply]

2845
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:02,980
That went well, right?

2846
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:05,250
I will just go to loo
and coming back.

2847
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:07,820
Switch off the lights.
It will get cool.

2848
02:21:16,660 --> 02:21:19,660
[Mukul] No problem.
We at least tried.

2849
02:21:28,660 --> 02:21:30,740
[Siren blaring]

2850
02:21:39,190 --> 02:21:41,730
[Car doors open and closes]

2851
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:45,290
- Disconnect water connection.
- What is the scene?

2852
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:46,370
Court has ordered
to disconnect your

2853
02:21:46,460 --> 02:21:47,660
water, electricity
and gas connections.

2854
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:48,560
How can you disconnect in this way?

2855
02:21:48,650 --> 02:21:49,910
Sir, we have not
received the notice.

2856
02:21:50,110 --> 02:21:51,980
How many times we will give notice?
How many times?

2857
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:53,300
What are you saying?

2858
02:21:53,390 --> 02:21:54,940
We will file a complaint
against you.

2859
02:21:55,030 --> 02:21:56,190
- Right.
- Come on do complain.

2860
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:58,980
Whom do you want to complaint?
Come on do it.

2861
02:21:59,070 --> 02:21:59,820
- No...
- Calm down.

2862
02:21:59,910 --> 02:22:01,420
Look, you are committing
a crime by interfering

2863
02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:02,820
in government work. And not us.

2864
02:22:02,910 --> 02:22:04,390
We're appealing
in the Supreme Court.

2865
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:05,340
Supreme Court?

2866
02:22:05,430 --> 02:22:07,140
Go to the terrace and
disconnect water connection.

2867
02:22:07,230 --> 02:22:08,700
It is Diwali after two days
and then you can do your job.

2868
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:11,220
Diwali or Eid?
But we have to work every day.

2869
02:22:11,310 --> 02:22:12,830
Disconnect water connection.

2870

[Indistinct chattering]

2871
02:22:14,950 --> 02:22:17,790

2873

- Don't touch me.
- Sorry sir.

2874

Sir. Sir.

2875
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:32,690
We are at
the Kala Kriti society today.

2876
02:22:32,780 --> 02:22:35,470
There has been some chaos
between the residents and...

2877
02:22:39,310 --> 02:22:42,350
- Sir, please wait for a minute.
- Disconnect water connection.

02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:04,810
- Sir, please listen to me.
- Keep quiet.

2940
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:06,930
- Sir, please listen to me.
- Put them behind bars.

2941
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:08,250
Why are you putting us behind bars?

2942
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:09,340
[Man 1] I went to disconnect
their gas connection

2943
02:25:09,430 --> 02:25:10,900
but he raised his hands on me.

2944
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:13,010
- [Woman 1] File the report.
- Okay.

2945
02:25:17,980 --> 02:25:20,790
- Sit down.
- Okay, we will sit.

2946
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:42,760
They are sitting there. Himansh.

2947
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:45,260
Hey, who are you all?

2948
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:48,730
- Who are you?
- Madam, please release them.

2949
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:50,850
Madam, he has BP and heart problem.

2950
02:25:50,940 --> 02:25:52,660
We will pay the amount of bail.
Please, madam.

2951
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:54,220
This is non bailable offence.

2952
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:57,340
After Diwali when the court
opens then get their bail done.

2953
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:00,540
Madam, they belong to
good family and are educated.

2954
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:01,610
They are not criminals.

2955
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:03,500
He raised a hand on police officer.

2956
02:26:03,660 --> 02:26:05,970
They seem to be true criminals.

2957
02:26:06,060 --> 02:26:08,970
Madam, by mistake he touched you.

2958
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:11,900
Madam, we apologize on their
behalf. Please release them.

2959
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:14,420
Please don't create chaos here.
Don't create chaos here.

2960
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:18,660
- Madam, please listen to me.
- Madam, can't bail happen?

2961
02:26:18,850 --> 02:26:22,010
- Madam, can't we bail them out?
- Madam, please come outside.

2962
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:23,480
Why are you doing this?

2963
02:26:23,570 --> 02:26:25,300
- Poonam.
- Vandana.

2964
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:26,800
Poonam.

2965
02:26:26,890 --> 02:26:28,370
Himansh... Vansh.

2966
02:26:28,700 --> 02:26:30,320
At least let us meet them.

2967
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:34,890
Mom, Rishi... Rishi's father
is very influential.

2968
02:26:34,980 --> 02:26:36,530
He can help us.

2969
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:40,200
Few days ago you asked for divorce
and now you will ask for help.

2970
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:42,290
What will they think?
What kind of people are we?

2971
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:44,130
Mother, to save them
is more important

2972
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:46,130
or what they will
think is more important.

2973
02:26:46,220 --> 02:26:48,550
Listen, what do you think
of yourself? [Slaps]

2974
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:51,210
Will you tease her?
[Slaps]

2975
02:26:51,300 --> 02:26:52,900
Let her talk to her father-in-law.

2976
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:56,170
Yes. All these rules
and law are for us.

2977
02:26:56,260 --> 02:26:58,330
Influential people get
their work done quickly.

2978
02:26:58,420 --> 02:26:59,740
Let her try, please.

2979
02:27:00,650 --> 02:27:02,420
Come on. Tease in front of me.

2980
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:05,540
So, you have come here
to ask help from me.

2981
02:27:06,380 --> 02:27:08,620
And not to stay back in this house.

2982
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:13,820
They want help from us
and not relationship.

2983
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:18,180
Look, I can help them
to get released.

2984
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:21,580
I just have to
make 2-4 phone calls.

2985
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:28,690
But in return of that,
will you come back to Rishi?

2986
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:31,950
You are keeping a condition.

2987
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:33,950
Just as you are
thinking about your son

2988
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:35,830
we are also thinking about our son.

2989
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:42,020
Brother, we had come here to
ask for a favor and not do a deal.

2990
02:27:42,210 --> 02:27:43,980
Let's go, Hina.

2991
02:27:54,530 --> 02:27:58,610
[Hina] Uncle, none of your contacts
and influence is working.

2992
02:27:59,180 --> 02:28:01,820
Father and Vansh will
have to stay in jail all night.

2993
02:28:03,060 --> 02:28:05,710
Okay, I will call you later.
My battery is dying.

2994
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:07,550
[Cell phone ringing]

2995
02:28:08,460 --> 02:28:12,900
Hello, I am sorry I could
not send tiffin to you today.

2996
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:16,380
Some problem is going
on in our society.

2997
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:20,020
In the mean time please
make alternative arrangement.

2998
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:23,450
I will start soon. Thank you.

2999
02:28:31,020 --> 02:28:35,210
Hello, Nirmala aunty, you said
that you would talk to the lawyer.

3000
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:09,030
[Door opens]

3001
02:29:21,270 --> 02:29:22,410
[Door closes]

3002
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:25,650
During young days
once I had gone to jail.

3003
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:26,660
Really?

3004
02:29:27,940 --> 02:29:33,050
Neighbor Khosla
said bad words to mom.

3005
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:36,570
Father and I went to
his house with a sword.

3006
02:29:36,660 --> 02:29:38,970
In those days we had
a sword in our house.

3007
02:29:39,060 --> 02:29:40,850
- Sword. Wow!
- Yes.

3008
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:41,860
Then?

3009
02:29:42,180 --> 02:29:46,250
Police made a case and put father
and me behind bars for two days.

3010
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:48,530
Oh!

3011
02:29:50,260 --> 02:29:51,450
It is the tradition
of our family that

3012
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:52,820
father and son duo is
behind bars together.

3013
02:29:54,180 --> 02:29:56,420
It is a genetic disorder.
[Chuckles]

3014
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:03,540
It was my fantasy.

3015
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:04,780
[Hina] What?

3016
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:07,260
Candle light dinner.

3017
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:11,790
And you married the most
unromantic person of this world.

3018
02:30:14,060 --> 02:30:17,940
Your father is romantic
but in his own way.

3019
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:23,140
Eat.

3020
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:26,220
[Man 1] This is your food.

3021
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:34,860
Have it, sir.

3022
02:30:35,730 --> 02:30:37,220
[Clears throat]

3023
02:30:39,220 --> 02:30:41,010
- Take it, Son.
- First you take.

3024
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:53,820
You eat this as well.

3025
02:30:55,110 --> 02:30:56,460
It is not delicious so I eat it.

3026
02:30:58,380 --> 02:31:00,580
Don't become sentimental.
Eat it. I am having mine.

3027
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:02,580
You will have trouble
in stomach at night

3028
02:31:02,670 --> 02:31:03,800
and no one will be able to sleep.

3029
02:31:05,940 --> 02:31:07,790
I am not hungry, dear.

3030
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:09,650
[Scoffs]

3031
02:31:10,060 --> 02:31:13,440
You are a very bad actor. Eat it.

3032
02:31:24,260 --> 02:31:27,380
[Man 1]
Get up and four of you come out.

3033
02:31:27,820 --> 02:31:29,460
- What is this, sir?
- Come out.

3034
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:32,620
- Father...
- Rishi.

3035
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:36,130
[Woman] What is this, sir?
Why did you do like this?

3036
02:31:36,220 --> 02:31:37,820
Don't do it again.

3037
02:31:38,740 --> 02:31:40,460
Tell Mr. Shirke
that I have done it.

3038
02:31:40,620 --> 02:31:42,860
- Thank you, madam.
- There is nothing to be grateful.

3039
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:48,020
Let's go.

3040
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:50,730
Did you all have food?

3041
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:53,140
Yes, five course
meal with champagne.

3042
02:31:53,780 --> 02:31:55,450
But, Son, how did
you get us released?

3043
02:31:55,540 --> 02:31:57,600
Uncle, you do not know my father.

3044
02:31:58,700 --> 02:32:01,650
Anyways, I think you
should talk to chief minister.

3045
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:02,890
Something might work out.

3046
02:32:02,980 --> 02:32:08,300
Our MLA does not pay heed to us
then what will we talk to CM sir.

3047
02:32:08,540 --> 02:32:09,660
It will be done, Uncle.

3048
02:32:09,940 --> 02:32:11,530
When will dad's contact be of use?

3049
02:32:11,620 --> 02:32:13,170
Thank you so much.

3050
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:14,170
Thank you.

3051
02:32:14,260 --> 02:32:15,690
[Bolkar] Such a sweet boy Rishi is.

3052
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:17,610
Nowadays no one does for
their near and dear ones.

3053
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:18,730
Thank you so much.

3054
02:32:18,820 --> 02:32:20,560
I am really sorry
for what dad said.

3055
02:32:20,980 --> 02:32:22,210
He shouldn't have.

3056
02:32:22,300 --> 02:32:23,540
I have explained to him

3057
02:32:23,630 --> 02:32:26,300
that our problem and
family problems are different.

3058
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:28,820
Take care.

3059
02:32:29,530 --> 02:32:30,540
Thank you.

3060
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:33,090
Bye.

3061
02:32:36,110 --> 02:32:36,890
[Door closes]

3062
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:41,780
You are right but what can we do?
We are also helpless.

3063
02:32:42,180 --> 02:32:44,930
The government cannot
go against the court's order.

3064
02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:47,330
Sir, you have special powers.

3065
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:50,890
By passing an ordinance in your
Vidhan Sabha (legislative assembly)

3066
02:32:50,980 --> 02:32:53,340
please authorize our society, sir.

3067
02:32:53,430 --> 02:32:54,370
[Chuckles]

3068
02:32:54,460 --> 02:32:56,820
There are many such
illegal buildings in Mumbai.

3069
02:32:57,140 --> 02:32:59,530
If I authorize one then we
will have to do each one of them.

3070
02:32:59,620 --> 02:33:00,740
Please do it, sir.

3071
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:03,650
No one purposely
buys illegal houses.

3072
02:33:03,740 --> 02:33:05,290
With due respect, sir,

3073
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:10,330
if government can legalize slum
built till 2000

3074
02:33:10,650 --> 02:33:11,570
then why not our houses.

3075
02:33:11,660 --> 02:33:14,610
Exactly.
Because we are not vote bank.

3076
02:33:15,210 --> 02:33:16,650
[Stammering]

3077
02:33:16,740 --> 02:33:20,700
He is trying to say that
you will only think of our welfare.

3078
02:33:20,980 --> 02:33:22,460
You are not trying to understand.

3079
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:25,100
If I authorize your society

3080
02:33:25,190 --> 02:33:28,500
then anyone will construct illegaly
anywhere they feel like.

3081
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:33,210
Due to this the fear of law will
be erased from builders' minds.

3082
02:33:33,300 --> 02:33:36,810
So you want to make us target
and set an example in the society.

3083
02:33:36,900 --> 02:33:38,540
You don't know what
you are talking about.

3084
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:43,250
Look, only Supreme Court
can grant relief to you.

3085
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:44,900
No, that we are trying, sir.

3086
02:33:45,460 --> 02:33:48,970
But if you could put in
a kind word from your end then...

3087
02:33:49,060 --> 02:33:51,010
Sir, at least you can get our gas

3088
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:55,940
and electricity connections
reinstalled as a Diwali gift.

3089
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:58,660
Sir, there are so many
lights and decorations here

3090
02:33:59,140 --> 02:34:00,620
but there is darkness in our homes.

3091
02:34:00,940 --> 02:34:03,100
That we are managing somehow but...

3092
02:34:03,220 --> 02:34:06,650
Look, Mr. Harish Shah is
friend of our party president

3093
02:34:06,740 --> 02:34:07,940
that is why I met you all.

3094
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:09,900
But government cannot
do anything in this.

3095
02:34:10,140 --> 02:34:11,100
Goodbye.

3096
02:34:11,620 --> 02:34:14,570
Sir, Jalgaon's committee
is waiting for you, sir.

3097
02:34:14,660 --> 02:34:15,860
This is the file, sir.

3098
02:34:16,980 --> 02:34:17,970
Please.

3099
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:25,290
Call up the office

3100
02:34:25,380 --> 02:34:28,250
and tell there is no electricity,
water and there is crisis at home.

3101
02:34:28,340 --> 02:34:29,540
Anyone will agree.

3102
02:34:29,630 --> 02:34:32,660
Vandana, I am already
in bad books of Karan.

3103
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:34,500
I haven't been to the office
for so many days.

3104
02:34:34,700 --> 02:34:38,860
I will make Diwali offering, pamper
him and his anger will cool down.

3105
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:41,260
You did not have a bath on Diwali.

3106
02:34:41,380 --> 02:34:42,650
While coming from hospital
I will have a bath.

3107
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:44,090
You too have a bath there.

Can I call him?

F**k off.

3135
02:36:22,860 --> 02:36:25,530
The truth is that sometimes
life sucks so much

3136
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:27,580
that there is nothing
to thank for.

my mother finds a reason
to carry on.

3140
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:40,580
Honestly her optimism
is exhausting.

3141

Vansh, Hina, come.

3142
02:36:43,020 --> 02:36:44,500
Himansh, come and offer prayers.

3143
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:47,820
By offering prayers will
Goddess Laxmi come home?

3144
02:36:48,900 --> 02:36:54,580
Will she give me keys to 3 bedroom
hall flat and ask me to have fun?

3145

I have lost my job.
Your business got shut.

3146

In few days we will
lose this house as well.

Why should we celebrate Diwali?

3148

It is Diwali today
so let's celebrate Diwali.

Today we do not have anything.

Tomorrow we might
lose our house also.

3151

But at least we are together.

3152

Mom, nothing will
happen with pep talk.

Why don't you understand?
How will we run the house?

3154
02:37:24,780 --> 02:37:29,050
I will run the house.
I have earned 30,000 this month.

3155
02:37:29,140 --> 02:37:31,290
I will do more events
and earn money.

3156
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:37,660
Papa, why are you
looking at me like this?

3157
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:40,810
I know I am selfish,

And are involved
in my problems only.

But can run the house as well.

3160

Actually even I can get
a job worth 40,000.

Did you see?
We found a solution to the problem.

3162
02:37:57,500 --> 02:38:00,230
I don't know when will
you stop taking stress?

3163
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:04,250
So many times I have explained
that it is not good for health.

3164
02:38:04,340 --> 02:38:05,740
Stop explaining me.

3165
02:38:05,980 --> 02:38:08,210
Come on let's offer prayers.

3166
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:10,610

song on internet.

As you can see residents of Kala
Kriti society are really suffering.

Let us ask them
about their condition.

We have not had a bath
for last 2-3 days.

And we are feeling itchy as well.

Why are you asking children?
Ask us.

3214

We pay lakhs of rupees as tax and
this is the way we are treated.

is no water in the house.

that why is it doing this with us.

02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:32,660
One more thing.

3279
02:45:32,750 --> 02:45:36,040
Tomorrow morning water tanker
will come at sharp 7 o'clock.

3280
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:38,970
Please be ready to take water.

3281
02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:41,180
Tomorrow morning at sharp 7.

3282
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:43,300
As of now enjoy dinner.
Come, child.

3283
02:45:43,850 --> 02:45:45,010
Come, Uncle.

3284
02:45:53,560 --> 02:45:54,840
[Door opens]

3285
02:45:56,120 --> 02:45:57,100
Nice.

3286
02:45:57,410 --> 02:45:59,390
Thanks.
Close the door.

3287
02:46:00,990 --> 02:46:02,120
What should I do?

3288
02:46:03,940 --> 02:46:05,280
Pack those books.

3289
02:46:06,040 --> 02:46:07,070
Okay.

3290
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:09,620
Where are you moving?
Did you find a house?

3291
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:12,610
No, not yet. I am still finding.

3292
02:46:13,160 --> 02:46:14,830
I will stay at my aunt's place.
[Chuckles]

3293
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:16,280
She is a monster.

3294
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:19,870
What about you guys?
Where are you shifting?

3295
02:46:22,990 --> 02:46:24,030
I don't know.

3296
02:46:26,350 --> 02:46:28,770
It seems as if I had
gone for a movie with mom.

3297
02:46:29,550 --> 02:46:30,890
I was five years old.

3298
02:46:32,260 --> 02:46:34,330
Because of rush in the
theatre I left mom's hand.

3299
02:46:35,850 --> 02:46:36,950
Mom got lost.

3300
02:46:37,440 --> 02:46:39,320
I mean I got lost.

3301
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:42,690
[Sighs]

3302
02:46:44,210 --> 02:46:46,170
For two minutes I got scared.

3303
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:50,700
I could not understand.

3304
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:55,090
I felt as if...

3305
02:46:57,680 --> 02:46:58,830
it's all over.

3306
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:05,120
Even today I am feeling the same.

3307
02:47:11,690 --> 02:47:13,590
Where will we go? What will we do?

3308
02:47:15,990 --> 02:47:17,070
I am very scared, bro.

3309
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:30,350
It's going to be fine.

3310
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:39,710
Come, give me a hug.

3311
02:47:41,800 --> 02:47:42,770
Come.

3312
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:46,160
[Vansh sniffles]

3313
02:47:59,700 --> 02:48:01,530
[Vansh sighs]

3314
02:48:27,540 --> 02:48:30,990
I had read on internet
that stress is reduced by mating.

3315
02:48:32,040 --> 02:48:33,310
Did it happen?

3316
02:48:34,630 --> 02:48:36,010
[Tongue clicks]

3317
02:48:36,810 --> 02:48:38,270
I will have to try again.

3318
02:48:38,970 --> 02:48:40,560
[Chuckles]

3319
02:48:48,870 --> 02:48:50,600
Do you want to go home, sir?

3320
02:48:50,690 --> 02:48:52,850
Do rest of the patients stay here?

3321
02:48:52,940 --> 02:48:54,190
[Laughing]

3322
02:48:54,280 --> 02:48:55,440
All his reports are good.

3323
02:48:55,650 --> 02:48:57,530
I will get his
discharge papers ready.

3324
02:48:57,620 --> 02:48:59,390
By evening you can take him home.

3325
02:48:59,610 --> 02:49:01,180
Okay. Take care.

3326
02:49:01,270 --> 02:49:02,920
- Thank you, doctor.
- [Woman] Okay.

3327
02:49:04,040 --> 02:49:07,530
Hurry up before they
change their mind.

3328
02:49:08,030 --> 02:49:08,990
- Yes, Father.
- Hurry up.

3329
02:49:09,080 --> 02:49:11,360
I will get the discharge
papers prepared.

3330
02:49:11,450 --> 02:49:12,570
Hurry up.

3331
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:15,180
[Mukul] Everyone will get water.
Everyone please adjust.

3332
02:49:15,270 --> 02:49:16,780
What are you doing, Mr. Gehi?

3333
02:49:16,870 --> 02:49:19,620
Six buckets for one family.
This is not fair.

3334
02:49:19,710 --> 02:49:21,510
Two buckets are enough.
Pawan, make father understand.

3335
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:22,760
Mrs. Gehi, please come.

3336
02:49:22,850 --> 02:49:23,960
Please don't waste water.

3337
02:49:24,050 --> 02:49:26,700
Come and have a bath at my place.

3338
02:49:26,790 --> 02:49:27,580
Easy.

3339
02:49:27,670 --> 02:49:28,790
Bolkar family,
you please come ahead.

3340
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:30,290
Why are you filling
water from the tanker?

3341
02:49:30,380 --> 02:49:31,560
Get the tank filled with the pump.

3342
02:49:31,650 --> 02:49:33,480
Without light only
superman can pump water.

3343
02:49:33,570 --> 02:49:36,030
Please take water. Many
people still have to take water.

3344
02:49:36,310 --> 02:49:37,290
Mohsin...

3345
02:49:37,380 --> 02:49:39,220
Hey heroine,
how can you come in between?

3346
02:49:39,310 --> 02:49:42,700
- She is with me.
- Please calm down.

3347
02:49:43,050 --> 02:49:44,440
How can you stand queue directly?

3348
02:49:44,530 --> 02:49:46,930
She is pregnant and her
husband is standing in queue.

3349
02:49:47,020 --> 02:49:50,180
No problem.
I will take when my turn comes.

3350
02:49:50,270 --> 02:49:52,380
- No problem.
- It does not look good.

3351
02:49:52,900 --> 02:49:54,100
Hello, Himansh.

3352
02:49:54,190 --> 02:50:00,100
There is water problem here,
no electricity and so much stress.

3353
02:50:00,190 --> 02:50:03,130
You know it. What will we
do if father becomes unwell again?

3354
02:50:03,330 --> 02:50:05,040
Please move ahead.

3355
02:50:05,690 --> 02:50:07,910
[Vandana] Himansh,
we all want him to stay here.

3356
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:09,670
But he needs rest.

3357
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:11,100
If you say then shall
I talk to Hriday?

3358
02:50:11,190 --> 02:50:12,390
[Mukul]
Give buckets to the children.

3359
02:50:13,860 --> 02:50:16,650
[Woman] What can he do.
Water flowing speed is slow.

3360
02:50:16,740 --> 02:50:18,660
[Woman 2]
We had called for two tankers.

3361
02:50:18,980 --> 02:50:20,410
Where is the second tanker?

3362
02:50:20,540 --> 02:50:24,230
[Woman 3] Sweety, get two buckets.
And big one.

3363
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:27,540
Himansh,
why am I not going to my home?

3364
02:50:28,730 --> 02:50:32,070
Papa, my house is yours too.

3365
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:36,290
That is fine but I want
to sleep on my bed in my room.

3366
02:50:36,380 --> 02:50:37,160
What problem do you have?

3367
02:50:37,250 --> 02:50:39,700
I have no problem, Papa.

3368
02:50:40,410 --> 02:50:42,060
Even I can take care of you.

3369
02:50:42,150 --> 02:50:45,640
Look, Son,
I have friends in Kala Kriti

3370
02:50:45,730 --> 02:50:47,770
and the case is
also going on there.

3371
02:50:48,410 --> 02:50:51,490
I want to go home and you
are throwing me out of the house.

3372
02:50:51,580 --> 02:50:52,640
I can't understand.

3373
02:50:53,930 --> 02:50:56,210
Papa, who am I to throw
you out of the house?

3374
02:50:56,530 --> 02:50:57,540
What is the matter?

3375
02:50:57,630 --> 02:50:59,470
Already there is
so much stress there.

3376
02:50:59,890 --> 02:51:04,480
Municipality has disconnected
water, electricity and gas supply.

3377
02:51:05,090 --> 02:51:07,120
Now don't be stubborn
like children.

3378
02:51:09,770 --> 02:51:11,960
Disconnected electricity,
water and gas supply.

3379
02:51:14,270 --> 02:51:15,630
Why didn't you tell me?

3380
02:51:15,910 --> 02:51:17,460
What would have
happened if I told you?

3381
02:51:17,550 --> 02:51:18,730
What could you do?

3382
02:51:21,190 --> 02:51:24,850
Can you do one thing?
Become 100% fit, please.

3383
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:27,770
I am fit.

3384
02:51:28,130 --> 02:51:30,400
Yes, Papa, you are completely fit.

3385
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:32,820
But come to our home for few days.

3386
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:36,370
Why are you being so partial to me?

3387
02:51:37,540 --> 02:51:39,350
After all even I am your son.

3388
02:51:41,390 --> 02:51:43,010
Come, let's go.

3389
02:51:44,460 --> 02:51:45,450
Come on.

3390
02:52:18,620 --> 02:52:20,450
[Anu] Sit carefully.

3391
02:52:20,540 --> 02:52:21,290
[Mr. Aggarwal] Okay, Mr. Srivastva.

3392
02:52:21,380 --> 02:52:22,580
Kitty, be careful.
Do not bang your head.

3393
02:52:22,670 --> 02:52:23,620
[Mr. Aggarwal] Bolkar sir.

3394
02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:25,820
Sister-in-law.

3395
02:52:27,250 --> 02:52:30,350
Mrs. Nirmala, forgive me

3396
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:32,200
as your younger brother
if I ever made a mistake.

3397
02:52:32,290 --> 02:52:34,520
What are you talking? Take care.

3398
02:52:35,770 --> 02:52:37,140
Let's go. We are getting late.

3399
02:52:37,670 --> 02:52:38,630
See you soon.

3400
02:52:39,320 --> 02:52:40,560
- Bye, dear.
- Bye.

3401
02:52:40,650 --> 02:52:44,180
Mr. Aggarwal, Anu,

3402
02:52:45,200 --> 02:52:46,820
how can you go like this?

3403
02:52:47,570 --> 02:52:48,740
What do you mean?

3404
02:52:49,330 --> 02:52:50,230
[Sighs]

3405
02:52:50,320 --> 02:52:51,220
Today you are going.

3406
02:52:51,310 --> 02:52:52,770
Tomorrow Mr. Bolkar will
say that they are going

3407
02:52:52,860 --> 02:52:54,000
and then Mr. Srivastava.

3408
02:52:54,090 --> 02:52:56,150
If all go one by one then

3409
02:52:56,350 --> 02:52:59,080
who will save our
homes and fight for it.

3410
02:52:59,760 --> 02:53:01,750
But, sister, how is it possible
to stay here?

3411
02:53:02,110 --> 02:53:06,270
There is no water and electricity
here. Children cannot stay here.

3412
02:53:06,640 --> 02:53:09,010
You all are there to fight.

3413
02:53:09,100 --> 02:53:11,950
Why? Why should we be
responsible to save your home?

3414
02:53:13,170 --> 02:53:14,610
If we stand in unity

3415
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:17,840
then municipality cannot
throw us out of our houses.

3416
02:53:17,930 --> 02:53:19,690
How can anyone fight alone?
Tell me.

3417
02:53:20,090 --> 02:53:20,990
[Mukul] Yes, Mr. Aggarwal.

3418
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:24,190
If we fight this battle
together then we will surely win.

3419
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:26,520
- Yes.
- Mr. Aggarwal, this is your home.

3420
02:53:26,800 --> 02:53:28,310
- You cannot go like this.
- But...

3421
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:30,940
Everything will be fine
when all will be together.

3422
02:53:31,030 --> 02:53:32,940
- [Mukul] Come on, buddy.
- Sister is right.

3423
02:53:33,330 --> 02:53:34,600
We all will fight together.

3424
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:36,680
Come, kitty. Come out.

3425
02:53:37,990 --> 02:53:39,440
- Absolutely.
- Everything will be fine.

3426
02:53:41,150 --> 02:53:42,570
Do you want to say anything, sir?

3427
02:53:42,660 --> 02:53:44,180
- What should I say?
- Anything, sir.

3428
02:53:44,390 --> 02:53:45,560
It will be a help
to Kala Kriti society.

3429
02:53:45,650 --> 02:53:47,150
We will upload on social media.

3430
02:53:47,420 --> 02:53:49,140
I have become old.

3431
02:53:49,630 --> 02:53:51,470
Let me stay comfortably in my home

3432
02:53:51,560 --> 02:53:54,490
otherwise my children
will leave me in old age home.

3433
02:53:54,580 --> 02:53:55,390
Mrs. Mehta.

3434
02:53:55,480 --> 02:53:57,960
This is not a pet but my child.

3435
02:53:58,550 --> 02:54:01,480
If we do not have homes
then where will I leave Pluto?

3436
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:04,740
The government will not only
take our home but our baby as well.

3437
02:54:04,900 --> 02:54:06,090
It is a murder.

3438
02:54:06,830 --> 02:54:08,620
I request everybody...

3439
02:54:09,300 --> 02:54:11,800
to help us.

3440
02:54:12,180 --> 02:54:13,000
[Vansh] Thank you.

3441
02:54:13,090 --> 02:54:14,590
[Mohsin] Who will go next? Pawan...

3442
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:15,670
Speak up.

3443
02:54:16,610 --> 02:54:17,900
My engagement broke.

3444
02:54:18,830 --> 02:54:20,750
I don't know whether
I will get married or not.

3445
02:54:22,640 --> 02:54:23,510
Mr. Chaubey.

3446
02:54:24,330 --> 02:54:27,780
I am not just a watchman
but a family.

3447
02:54:28,710 --> 02:54:30,580
The government is not
doing right with them.

3448
02:54:31,580 --> 02:54:32,900
Do you want to say anything,
Nirmala aunty?

3449
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:37,500
We all are a family and
now everyone will be separated.

3450
02:54:40,970 --> 02:54:43,040
I do not want so much.

Speak, Son.

3490
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:50,280
There's no point in shouting.

3491
02:57:50,510 --> 02:57:52,870
We must stop them in a planned way.

3492
02:57:53,250 --> 02:57:54,960
This is our society Kalakruti.

3493
02:57:55,850 --> 02:57:57,630
This is our gate.

3494
02:57:58,310 --> 02:58:01,360
And there is just one access
road leading to this gate.

3495
02:58:02,210 --> 02:58:04,400
Obviously, the Municipality will
come through this road.

[All] Yes.

3497
02:58:05,580 --> 02:58:08,300

[All] Yes.

3499
02:58:09,310 --> 02:58:11,940
They will bring their
JCBs for the demolition.

3500
02:58:12,260 --> 02:58:14,470
We will park our
cars outside the gate

3501
02:58:14,560 --> 02:58:16,140
so that their JCBs get blocked.

3502
02:58:16,230 --> 02:58:18,250
This is a society,
not a fort to block them...

3503

Listen to him first.

3504
02:58:20,570 --> 02:58:24,120
If they crush our cars,
break down the gate,

3505
02:58:24,210 --> 02:58:26,010
then we'll form human-shields.

3506
02:58:26,100 --> 02:58:27,760
Yes, we'll hold our ground.

But we don't have to be scared.
We've to fight.

They will have to run
over us with the bulldozer.

03:04:26,300 --> 03:04:27,800
- Listen you all.
- Speak.

3625
03:04:28,190 --> 03:04:32,170
We have orders from above to
use force. But follow court orders.

3626
03:04:32,260 --> 03:04:35,940
To hell with your court orders.
We don't accept your orders.

3627
03:04:36,030 --> 03:04:37,090
Please move.

3628
03:04:37,830 --> 03:04:41,150
Just a minute.
You can kill us if you want.

3629
03:04:41,240 --> 03:04:43,440
Because we cannot
live without our homes.

3630
03:04:43,530 --> 03:04:45,150
Yes, we cannot live without it.

3631
03:04:45,290 --> 03:04:47,860
Look, this is your last warning.

3632
03:04:47,950 --> 03:04:49,240
Move these bamboos
and open this gate.

3633
03:04:49,330 --> 03:04:51,530
And this is our last warning.
Go back.

3634
03:04:51,620 --> 03:04:53,470

3636
03:05:00,010 --> 03:05:01,700
Why is it taking so long, Khairnar?

3637
03:05:02,210 --> 03:05:03,710
It's been two hours.

3638
03:05:04,410 --> 03:05:06,390
Does it take so long to do a job?

3639
03:05:06,870 --> 03:05:08,580
Hurry up,
get those people out of there.

3640
03:05:08,670 --> 03:05:09,660
Finish this matter.

3641
03:05:10,370 --> 03:05:14,150
Bloody a*****e, he'll understand
when he comes out on the field.

3642
03:05:14,240 --> 03:05:16,200
Bring the JCB ahead,
move these cars.

3643

[Engine accelerates]

3644
03:05:20,590 --> 03:05:23,800
Commissioner, I don't want any
violence. No Lathi-charge, okay?

3645
03:05:23,890 --> 03:05:25,270
- Right, sir.
- Please take care.

3646
03:05:25,400 --> 03:05:26,360

03:06:45,060 --> 03:06:47,160
We won't move. We won't move.

3655

Move them.
I said no violence.

3656
03:07:04,730 --> 03:07:06,880
Hey Stop it. Please move.

3657
03:07:10,560 --> 03:07:11,980
JCB, break it down.

3658

[Man on TV]
Today is a black day, gentlemen.

3678
03:08:51,770 --> 03:08:56,330
I told you do not use force.
Do not force.

3679
03:08:57,010 --> 03:08:58,730
Have you lost your mind?

3680
03:08:59,910 --> 03:09:03,160
Now call bulldozers off.
Immediately. Call them back.

3681
03:09:03,250 --> 03:09:04,640
At once right now.

3682
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:06,800

Move. Move back.

3684
03:09:11,640 --> 03:09:14,010
He's fine.
Give him some fresh air.

3685

Take your force back.

3686
03:09:16,520 --> 03:09:18,010
Move back.

3687
03:09:18,570 --> 03:09:21,360
Take the JCB back. Take it back.

3688
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:24,790
Get the stretcher.

3689
03:09:24,950 --> 03:09:26,380
Lift him up, come on.

3690
03:09:26,760 --> 03:09:28,070
Take this.

3691
03:09:29,550 --> 03:09:32,230
If anything happens to him, then
the Municipality'll be responsible.

3692

Go, go.

3702
03:09:59,970 --> 03:10:03,430
The Administration, Media,
Court, you appealed to everyone.

3703
03:10:04,810 --> 03:10:06,460
And they all have the same opinion.

3704
03:10:07,440 --> 03:10:10,130
That illegal construction
has to be broken down.

3705
03:10:10,460 --> 03:10:12,610
Now you're making a
joke out of Law and Order.

3706
03:10:12,760 --> 03:10:15,100
Sir, Law, and Order
are making a joke out of us.

3707
03:10:15,370 --> 03:10:17,910
The whole country is saying
that this is an injustice.

3708
03:10:18,220 --> 03:10:19,990
- And you're not listening.
- Listen.

3709
03:10:21,620 --> 03:10:22,730
What is your name?

3710
03:10:23,040 --> 03:10:24,150
Vansh Sethi.

3711
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:25,160
Vansh...

3712
03:10:26,450 --> 03:10:29,160
we live in a country
that has some law.

3713
03:10:30,300 --> 03:10:32,230
This is not some Banana Republic.

3714
03:10:33,440 --> 03:10:35,330
I am requesting you personally.

3715
03:10:36,380 --> 03:10:39,130
Please surrender your house keys.

3716
03:10:40,780 --> 03:10:42,450
Nothing can be done now.

3717
03:10:43,170 --> 03:10:47,070
And these demonstrations,
Satyagraha, stop all this.

3718
03:10:47,860 --> 03:10:49,610
And what if we don't
hand over the keys.

3719
03:10:49,760 --> 03:10:53,060
Ma'am, don't mistake
my government's sympathy

3720
03:10:53,150 --> 03:10:54,730
for its weakness.

3721
03:10:54,920 --> 03:10:56,310
Nothing can be done now.

3722
03:10:56,660 --> 03:10:58,540
Just do as I said.

03:10:59,880 --> 03:11:00,830
Please.

Brother, what have you decided?
Where will you live now?

3726
03:11:27,290 --> 03:11:29,100
We'll rent someplace.

3727
03:11:29,300 --> 03:11:30,480
And the expenses?

3728
03:11:31,420 --> 03:11:33,250
Sister-in-law told
us about your job.

3729
03:11:34,290 --> 03:11:36,260
And even the lunch
business has shut down.

3730
03:11:36,870 --> 03:11:41,110
And starting a business
in a new area will take time.

3731
03:11:41,990 --> 03:11:43,420
I have some saving.

3732
03:11:44,380 --> 03:11:46,940
Heena and I will
support them too, Uncle.

3733
03:11:48,430 --> 03:11:50,390

I don't know how to say this,

Whenever I try to do
something you get angry.

03:12:00,220 --> 03:12:01,780
You misunderstand me.

3738
03:12:02,860 --> 03:12:04,240
But I am still saying it.

3739
03:12:05,500 --> 03:12:09,060
We have a property, which
is lying vacant for a long time.

3740
03:12:09,900 --> 03:12:12,720

why don't you guys move there?

on hospital bills and lawyers.

3743
03:12:19,030 --> 03:12:21,390
We're saying this because
we understand your position.

03:12:23,870 --> 03:12:27,830
Sister-in-law, Brother,
do give it a thought.

Oh, no!

3748
03:13:55,680 --> 03:13:58,390
This is just one room.

3749
03:13:59,440 --> 03:14:02,320
One bathroom, that too Indian.

3750
03:14:03,690 --> 03:14:05,090
How are we going to live here?

3751
03:14:05,180 --> 03:14:06,950
Let's rent someplace.

3752
03:14:07,590 --> 03:14:09,830
- Papa, say no.
- Wait a minute.

3753
03:14:10,300 --> 03:14:11,850
Think about it, children.

3754
03:14:12,210 --> 03:14:15,140
If you try to rent a two-bedroom
flat in a proper building

3755
03:14:15,230 --> 03:14:17,720
it won't cost anything
less than 50,000 rupees.

3756
03:14:18,430 --> 03:14:21,690
Plus brokerage and
two to three lakhs for deposit.

3757
03:14:22,360 --> 03:14:25,300
All those expenses and we have
only 700,000 rupees in the bank.

3758
03:14:25,590 --> 03:14:28,820
Now you guys tell me,
how long can we live there?

3759
03:14:29,730 --> 03:14:33,130
And Bharti said we can
stay here for as long as we want.

3760
03:14:34,120 --> 03:14:35,510
We won't have to pay a nickel.

Guddu, take a look at this as well.

3765
03:17:22,800 --> 03:17:24,010
But this is Burma ply, Sethi uncle.

3766
03:17:24,120 --> 03:17:26,540
No, this is Burma Teakwood.

3767
03:17:26,800 --> 03:17:28,750
No, but this is 10-15 years old.

3768
03:17:28,840 --> 03:17:29,940
I can't give you
more than 600 for this.

3769
03:17:30,030 --> 03:17:32,270
No, that's too less.
This is from Vansh's childhood.

3770
03:17:32,360 --> 03:17:34,100
That's nowhere close
to the original price.

3771
03:17:34,190 --> 03:17:36,440
[Guddu] I've given you the best
rates for all the stuff.

3772
03:17:37,290 --> 03:17:39,790
- [Himansh] 45,000 Rupees.
- [Vansh] 45 for all the stuff.

3773

Dining table, double-bed.
You call these decent rates, Guddu.

3778
03:17:51,830 --> 03:17:53,110
We've known you since
you were just a kid.

03:17:53,200 --> 03:17:54,700
Listen... Listen to me.

3780
03:17:54,900 --> 03:17:57,840
You up the prices a little, and
we'll negotiate again.

3781
03:17:58,160 --> 03:18:01,720
You know what, let's settle
for 50,000 rupees. Fix it, please.

3782
03:18:02,350 --> 03:18:03,570
Okay, what's in the kitchen?

3783
03:18:03,660 --> 03:18:04,880
[Himansh] There are a lot of
things in the kitchen.

3784
03:18:04,970 --> 03:18:05,930
But the kitchen is separate.

3785
03:18:06,020 --> 03:18:07,090
This does not include the kitchen.

3786
03:18:07,180 --> 03:18:08,740
[Guddu] But at least
let me take a look.

3787
03:18:08,830 --> 03:18:09,900
[Himansh] Yes, go take a look.

3788
03:18:09,990 --> 03:18:12,620
But sir,
this is all iron and steel.

3789
03:18:12,710 --> 03:18:13,640
This will be sold per kilo.

3790
03:18:13,730 --> 03:18:15,800
Don't touch that. Keep it down.

3791
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:17,830
I don't want to sell this.

3792
03:18:17,920 --> 03:18:18,860
Now leave.

3793
03:18:19,280 --> 03:18:20,710
I said leave,
I don't want to sell it.

3794
03:18:22,860 --> 03:18:24,490
Himansh, I won't sell this.

3795
03:18:25,300 --> 03:18:28,420
Vandana, we don't have a place for
all this stuff in the other house.

3796
03:18:28,510 --> 03:18:29,800
No, I don't care.

3797
03:18:30,090 --> 03:18:32,800
I don't know what I will do
with them, but I won't sell them.

3798
03:18:32,890 --> 03:18:33,680
These lunchboxes...

3799
03:18:33,770 --> 03:18:37,360
When we had nothing, we ran
our house with these lunchboxes.

3800
03:18:37,670 --> 03:18:39,300
How can I sell them?

3801
03:18:39,950 --> 03:18:41,060
This crib.

3802
03:18:41,220 --> 03:18:44,080
Vansh played in it, so did Hina.

3803
03:18:44,650 --> 03:18:47,520
Did we keep it safe all these
years just so we can sell it?

3804
03:18:48,250 --> 03:18:49,170
This table...

3805
03:18:49,260 --> 03:18:52,040
I used to sit here and
check my children's homework.

3806
03:18:52,180 --> 03:18:54,640
We cut so many birthday cakes here.

3807
03:18:54,730 --> 03:18:56,730
Played games on this table.

3808
03:18:56,940 --> 03:18:58,760
Scrabble, Monopoly.

3809
03:18:59,530 --> 03:19:02,850
The morning tea which
you used to make.

3810
03:19:03,870 --> 03:19:07,450
This is not just
a piece of furniture for me.

3811
03:19:08,130 --> 03:19:09,640
This is our life.

3812
03:19:10,510 --> 03:19:12,030
How can I sell them?

3813
03:19:12,780 --> 03:19:14,020
How? [Crying]

3814
03:19:27,380 --> 03:19:28,660
I am sorry.

3815
03:19:28,980 --> 03:19:30,000
It's okay.

3816
03:19:30,260 --> 03:19:31,420
I am sorry.

3817
03:19:37,030 --> 03:19:38,160
[Vansh] You know what they say

3818
03:19:38,250 --> 03:19:40,040
"Good things happen
to good people."

3819
03:19:40,460 --> 03:19:41,430
Bullshit!

3820
03:19:41,820 --> 03:19:45,240
Truth is... terrible things
happen to good people.

3821
03:19:45,530 --> 03:19:47,290
That is just how the world is.

3822
03:19:47,520 --> 03:19:49,800
Cruel, unfair, and random.

3823
03:19:50,420 --> 03:19:53,490
Happy endings are only in stories,
not in real life.

3824
03:19:53,670 --> 03:19:54,520
Hey.

3825
03:19:56,150 --> 03:19:57,060
Stop.

3826
03:19:57,520 --> 03:19:58,840
You're not supposed to carry.

3827
03:20:01,490 --> 03:20:02,790
[Grunts]

3828
03:20:03,900 --> 03:20:04,890
Abortion...

3829
03:20:05,940 --> 03:20:07,600
When will we get an abortion?

3830
03:20:11,160 --> 03:20:12,740
[Mohsin sighs]

3831
03:20:19,250 --> 03:20:20,640
[Sighs]

3832
03:20:40,270 --> 03:20:42,430
- Mr. Chaubey.
- [Mr. Chaubey] Yes, madam.

3833
03:20:42,520 --> 03:20:47,200
Inform everyone to come
to Nirmala madam's house at 9 pm.

3834
03:20:47,860 --> 03:20:48,810
[Mr. Chaubey] Yes, madam.

3835
03:20:55,230 --> 03:20:57,520
We'll be just wasting
space with that.

3836
03:20:57,610 --> 03:20:58,890
Let's appeal again.

3837
03:21:00,240 --> 03:21:01,430
Supreme Court.

3838
03:21:02,040 --> 03:21:03,520
- Review Petition.
- What?

3839
03:21:04,060 --> 03:21:05,500
We must leave for Delhi tomorrow.

3840
03:21:05,820 --> 03:21:07,060
What are you saying?
What happened?

3841
03:21:07,150 --> 03:21:08,850
I won't let it go so easily.

3842
03:21:08,940 --> 03:21:09,830
What won't you let go?

3843
03:21:09,920 --> 03:21:11,580
I won't leave my home so easily.

3844
03:21:11,670 --> 03:21:14,210
It will cost some money,
but let's try again.

3845
03:21:14,970 --> 03:21:16,020
Mrs. Nirmala,

3846
03:21:16,110 --> 03:21:19,190
call Mr. Gehi and Motwani
and call for an urgent meeting.

3847
03:21:19,650 --> 03:21:21,550
I am coming.
I am coming.

3848
03:21:22,010 --> 03:21:24,290
Go after him.
Look what's going on?

3849
03:21:24,700 --> 03:21:25,510
[Vansh] Dad.

3850
03:21:25,600 --> 03:21:28,000
We're too late now, Himansh.

3851
03:21:28,360 --> 03:21:29,920
Nothing can be done now.

3852
03:21:30,220 --> 03:21:31,360
Sethi sir, you're right.

3853
03:21:31,910 --> 03:21:34,100
But what's the point of going
through all the trouble again.

3854
03:21:34,430 --> 03:21:36,410
We've tried everything.

3855
03:21:36,500 --> 03:21:39,850
Going to Delhi again,
paying lawyers.

3856
03:21:40,370 --> 03:21:41,970
But the conclusion
will still be the same.

3857
03:21:42,060 --> 03:21:44,160
Try to understand.

3858
03:21:44,250 --> 03:21:47,200
Maybe filing a review petition
might do something.

3859
03:21:47,600 --> 03:21:50,050
It will be a different
judge and a different judgment.

3860
03:21:50,140 --> 03:21:51,650
Forget it, Sethi sir.

3861
03:21:51,950 --> 03:21:53,540
My stuff is getting
loaded at the back.

3862
03:21:53,670 --> 03:21:55,280
Our tickets to Canada
have arrived as well.

3863
03:21:55,370 --> 03:21:57,100
And we're going to
gather everyone around

3864
03:21:57,190 --> 03:21:58,700
to hand over the keys
to the Municipality.

3865
03:22:03,220 --> 03:22:04,250
Okay.

3866
03:22:04,590 --> 03:22:07,310
Vansh, please explain to Sethi sir.

3867
03:22:07,700 --> 03:22:09,340
This is absolutely impossible.

3868
03:22:10,250 --> 03:22:12,950
No, it's okay.
It's okay if you can't come along.

3869
03:22:14,300 --> 03:22:15,580
I will go alone.

3870
03:22:15,670 --> 03:22:17,570
Sethi sir, please talk...

3871
03:22:17,780 --> 03:22:20,130
- Sethi sir...
- No problem, thank you.

3872
03:22:32,770 --> 03:22:35,450
Okay, sir,
see you tomorrow in Delhi.

3873
03:22:36,020 --> 03:22:37,500
Okay, thank you.

3874
03:22:39,240 --> 03:22:42,150
The lawyer got a hearing
date for tomorrow.

3875
03:22:42,550 --> 03:22:44,990
Book a ticket for me
to Delhi tomorrow morning.

3876
03:22:45,960 --> 03:22:47,940
What about the lawyer's fee?

3877
03:22:48,410 --> 03:22:49,660
How are we going to do it?

3878
03:22:50,280 --> 03:22:51,340
He's defending our case for free.

3879
03:22:51,430 --> 03:22:54,140
If he wins,
he will get a lot of publicity.

3880
03:22:54,230 --> 03:22:55,750
And, what about our stuff, Papa?

3881
03:22:58,070 --> 03:23:01,160
I mean, there are chances
of getting the same verdict.

3882
03:23:02,450 --> 03:23:03,980
If the demolition crew come down

3883
03:23:04,070 --> 03:23:05,670
then how will we sell
it at the last minute?

3884
03:23:06,410 --> 03:23:08,510
Son, think positive.

3885
03:23:09,570 --> 03:23:11,730
We'll keep it in the
society office for now.

3886
03:23:12,370 --> 03:23:13,930
The others have
kept it there as well.

3887
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:15,530
I'll call Rishi as well.

3888
03:23:16,170 --> 03:23:17,440
He'll come and help.

3889
03:23:21,820 --> 03:23:23,480
What have you thought
about him, dear?

3890
03:23:26,660 --> 03:23:29,230
We think you should
give him a chance.

3891
03:23:30,210 --> 03:23:32,040
He's trying his best
to convince you.

3892
03:23:33,790 --> 03:23:35,360
You guys don't understand.

3893
03:23:35,630 --> 03:23:37,830
If I patch up with him now

3894
03:23:38,400 --> 03:23:42,770
he'll think I am going back
because I don't have a home.

3895
03:23:44,170 --> 03:23:46,860
He'll think it's my helplessness
and not my choice.

3896
03:23:47,640 --> 03:23:48,960
I don't want that.

3897
03:23:52,090 --> 03:23:54,040
You've grown smart in my company.

3898
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:56,140
Eat your food.

3899
03:23:59,300 --> 03:24:00,500
Vansh.

3900
03:24:00,590 --> 03:24:01,810
Take a selfie.

3901
03:24:02,970 --> 03:24:04,120
Now?

3902
03:24:04,930 --> 03:24:08,700
Maybe this is our last lunch
in this house.

3903
03:24:11,540 --> 03:24:13,790
Think positive, Vandana.

3904
03:24:16,360 --> 03:24:17,490
[Vansh clears throat]

3905
03:24:19,460 --> 03:24:21,220
Hashtag last lunch.

3906
03:24:42,400 --> 03:24:43,950
[Mukul] Mr. Gehi,
did you talk to her?

3907
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:45,440
Why did Nirmala call us
at this hour?

3908
03:24:45,530 --> 03:24:46,980
[Gehi] I don't know either.

3909
03:24:47,170 --> 03:24:49,040
Our packing is not complete yet.

3910
03:24:49,130 --> 03:24:50,310
Mrs. Nirmala.

3911
03:24:50,700 --> 03:24:53,260
Your voice has grown weak.
Knock on the door instead.

3912
03:24:53,670 --> 03:24:55,290
[Knocking]

3913
03:24:55,670 --> 03:24:56,680
[Vansh] Aunty.

3914
03:24:58,100 --> 03:24:59,270
[Woman] Someone call her.

3915
03:24:59,360 --> 03:25:01,240
[Gehi] Her battery must be dead.

3916
03:25:01,920 --> 03:25:03,790
Hello, welcome.

3917
03:25:03,880 --> 03:25:05,710
Come in. [Chuckles]

3918
03:25:08,940 --> 03:25:10,910
You look like Ms. Nirmala today.

3919
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:14,210
Don't stand outside, come in
Come.

3920
03:25:15,800 --> 03:25:17,680
- Come.
- How are you, sir?

3921
03:25:17,820 --> 03:25:18,620
Come.

3922
03:25:18,710 --> 03:25:20,600
Hello. Sit, sit.

3923
03:25:20,800 --> 03:25:22,170
Hello, sir.
How are you?

3924
03:25:31,650 --> 03:25:33,490
[Exhales deeply]

3925
03:25:40,600 --> 03:25:42,100
Please be comfortable.

3926
03:25:42,960 --> 03:25:48,660
Look, there are two kinds
of people in the world.

3927
03:25:49,660 --> 03:25:51,710
You've all seen the Titanic.

3928
03:25:52,340 --> 03:25:53,750
Now, remember the last scene.

3929
03:25:53,990 --> 03:25:55,500
The ship is sinking.

3930
03:25:55,980 --> 03:25:59,960
Most of the people are running,
crying and yelling.

3931
03:26:00,550 --> 03:26:02,240
But in this entire confusion

3932
03:26:02,330 --> 03:26:05,080
only four people are
merrily playing the violin.

3933
03:26:05,750 --> 03:26:09,220
Thinking that they
are going to sink anyway

3934
03:26:09,940 --> 03:26:12,030
so why don't we go
down singing and dancing?

3935
03:26:13,560 --> 03:26:15,150
Now you guys decide

3936
03:26:16,150 --> 03:26:18,610
whether you're the
panic-stricken lot.

3937
03:26:19,250 --> 03:26:21,550
or the ones going down merrily?

3938
03:26:25,250 --> 03:26:27,730
Today is our last night
in this society.

3939
03:26:29,910 --> 03:26:34,760
So those who want to cry
alone in their homes, well adios.

3940
03:26:35,770 --> 03:26:38,540
And those who are going
down singing and dancing

3941
03:26:38,940 --> 03:26:42,010
there's rum,
vodka, and whiskey there.

3942
03:26:42,100 --> 03:26:43,150
[Chuckles]

3943
03:26:43,240 --> 03:26:44,540
Choose your poison.

3944
03:26:44,860 --> 03:26:48,080
But for God's sake
don't ask for ice.

3945
03:26:48,170 --> 03:26:50,310
[Laughter]

3946
03:26:52,620 --> 03:26:55,170
Obviously, vodka, rum, whiskey.

3947
03:26:56,370 --> 03:26:58,460
Come on, guys.
Love you, Nirmala aunty.

3948
03:26:58,620 --> 03:27:00,200
Thank you.

3949
03:27:00,830 --> 03:27:01,760
Come on.

3950
03:27:06,170 --> 03:27:07,170
Very nice.

3951
03:27:07,520 --> 03:27:08,730
Thank you.
You love it.

3952
03:27:08,820 --> 03:27:10,000
Yes I love it.

3953
03:27:11,200 --> 03:27:13,190
[Laughter]

3954
03:27:14,590 --> 03:27:16,090
- Chaubey.
- Yes.

3955
03:27:16,180 --> 03:27:18,280
Keep that back.
Where is your glass?

3956
03:27:18,370 --> 03:27:20,460
Go get your drink first. Go.

3957
03:27:20,550 --> 03:27:22,640
He's already drunk.

3958
03:27:22,730 --> 03:27:24,200
[Nirmala] You are too much.

3959
03:27:24,290 --> 03:27:26,060
He's not the employee
of the society now.

3960
03:27:26,360 --> 03:27:27,350
Hello, everyone.

3961
03:27:27,820 --> 03:27:28,830
Hey, Rishi.

3962
03:27:28,920 --> 03:27:30,530
[Mukul] Did you get ice, or not?

3963
03:27:30,620 --> 03:27:31,440
If you didn't,
then you won't get a drink.

3964
03:27:31,530 --> 03:27:32,270
Shut up.

3965
03:27:32,360 --> 03:27:34,370
- Come, son.
- Come, sit here.

3966
03:27:34,980 --> 03:27:36,530
Did you smell alcohol, bro?

3967
03:27:36,770 --> 03:27:37,800
[Laughter]

3968
03:27:37,890 --> 03:27:41,890
Look, you are all
society members, by law.

3969
03:27:42,520 --> 03:27:44,540
But he's by love.

3970
03:27:44,950 --> 03:27:46,600
Great!

3971
03:27:46,730 --> 03:27:47,950
The boy's worked really hard.

3972
03:27:48,040 --> 03:27:49,870
[Mukul]
He's a very hard working boy.

3973
03:27:50,320 --> 03:27:51,870
First, tell me what
you're going to drink.

3974
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:54,910
- Nothing, Aunty. I am good.
- [Nirmala] No?

3975
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:56,860
Mrs. Nirmala,
he's become one of those...

3976
03:27:56,970 --> 03:27:58,050
- What are they called?
- What?

3977
03:27:58,140 --> 03:28:00,180
- Total tea... types.
- [Laughs]

3978
03:28:00,650 --> 03:28:02,710
- Tea-totallers.
- Exactly.

3979
03:28:02,800 --> 03:28:03,810
[Laughter]

3980
03:28:03,900 --> 03:28:07,050
Well, I am not a teetotaler, son.
Make one for me.

3981
03:28:07,180 --> 03:28:09,400
If my son had been here, he
would ask me to make one for him.

3982
03:28:09,580 --> 03:28:10,960
[Mukul] Your turn next.

3983
03:28:11,350 --> 03:28:12,560
You have to tell...

3984
03:28:12,730 --> 03:28:14,220
- Hey you.
- Come.

3985
03:28:14,600 --> 03:28:16,140
- What?
- Come.

3986
03:28:28,140 --> 03:28:29,260
[Hina] Vansh.

3987
03:28:31,650 --> 03:28:32,710
Vansh.

3988
03:28:33,320 --> 03:28:34,480
Yeah. [Clears throat]

3989
03:28:34,930 --> 03:28:35,970
- What's up.
- What's up.

3990
03:28:36,070 --> 03:28:37,060
What's up.

3991
03:28:37,830 --> 03:28:40,530
Actually, mom-dad are right here.
You can take her home.

3992
03:28:41,040 --> 03:28:42,430
You'll get some privacy out there.

3993
03:28:42,520 --> 03:28:45,260
- And anyway, making out reduces...
- Stress.

3994
03:28:46,400 --> 03:28:47,200
Yeah.

3995
03:28:47,290 --> 03:28:48,650
- Have heard that
- Yeah.

3996
03:28:49,270 --> 03:28:52,230
Rascal, when did you two do it?

3997
03:28:52,340 --> 03:28:53,420
When did we do it?

3998
03:28:53,780 --> 03:28:54,620
Friday.

3999
03:28:54,770 --> 03:28:57,040
We were stressed out
about the demolition

4000
03:28:57,420 --> 03:28:58,600
and you two were getting laid.

4001
03:28:58,690 --> 03:29:00,180
It reduces stress.

4002
03:29:01,800 --> 03:29:02,760
Rascal.

4003
03:29:03,440 --> 03:29:05,750
Let it be. Now you don't
lecture me on this subject.

4004
03:29:05,840 --> 03:29:07,250
I've to make a drink.

4005
03:29:08,340 --> 03:29:09,930
- Nice catch.
- Thank you.

4006
03:29:13,860 --> 03:29:18,500
I chased after him and
caught him by his collar.

4007
03:29:18,590 --> 03:29:19,840
Only after that did he marry me.

4008
03:29:19,930 --> 03:29:21,570
[Laughter]

4009
03:29:21,660 --> 03:29:22,630
Mrs. Bhonsle.

4010
03:29:22,720 --> 03:29:25,340
The truth is out.

4011
03:29:25,820 --> 03:29:28,110
One minute,
one minute, settle down.

4012
03:29:28,290 --> 03:29:30,540
Now let's play a game.

4013
03:29:30,630 --> 03:29:33,720
Now everyone must say
what's in their heart.

4014
03:29:34,070 --> 03:29:37,130
- Okay.
- And you must tell the truth.

4015
03:29:37,220 --> 03:29:38,110
Oh, God.

4016
03:29:38,200 --> 03:29:39,620
[Laughter]

4017
03:29:39,710 --> 03:29:40,820
Me first. Me first.

4018

[Laughter]

4019
03:29:42,570 --> 03:29:48,660
22 years ago, when I came
to this society to see the flat

4020
03:29:49,260 --> 03:29:50,900
it was a love-at-first-sight
situation for me.

4021
03:29:51,020 --> 03:29:53,120
- With the society?
- No.

4022
03:29:53,620 --> 03:29:55,470
With a very beautiful girl.

4023
03:29:55,560 --> 03:29:56,820
Wow.

4024
03:29:57,520 --> 03:29:59,680
- And she lived in this building.
- Wow.

4025
03:29:59,770 --> 03:30:02,150
- Who was she?
- I'll tell you, madam.

4026
03:30:02,400 --> 03:30:03,850
I'll tell you the entire story.

4027
03:30:04,260 --> 03:30:07,180
And I booked a flat here
because of that beautiful girl.

4028
03:30:07,270 --> 03:30:08,550
Romantic.

4029
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:11,260
[Mukul]
There's a twist in the story, son.

4030
03:30:11,410 --> 03:30:12,410
Now next.

4031
03:30:12,920 --> 03:30:16,000
Look at my fate,
after I came to live here

4032
03:30:16,090 --> 03:30:17,520
I found out that she is married.

4033
03:30:17,610 --> 03:30:19,040
Oh no.

4034
03:30:22,970 --> 03:30:24,640
Who was that girl?

4035
03:30:24,890 --> 03:30:27,460
You're asking me this,
Sister-in-law Vandana?

4036
03:30:27,550 --> 03:30:28,750
[Vandana] Tell us.

4037
03:30:28,840 --> 03:30:31,070
That girl is you.

4038
03:30:31,870 --> 03:30:35,560
- Sorry, Sethi sir. Sorry, Sethi.
- Heard it.

4039
03:30:35,650 --> 03:30:36,800
So sorry.

4040
03:30:36,890 --> 03:30:39,020
[Laughter]

4041
03:30:41,500 --> 03:30:44,420
Mr. Motwani, were you married
or unmarried back then?

4042
03:30:44,640 --> 03:30:46,790
[Laughter]

4043
03:30:48,150 --> 03:30:49,130
What...

4044
03:30:49,220 --> 03:30:50,260
Mr. Sethi.

4045
03:30:51,160 --> 03:30:52,200
What can I say?

4046
03:30:52,290 --> 03:30:54,790
Sethi sir,
say whatever you like today.

4047
03:30:54,920 --> 03:30:56,270
Everything is allowed today.

4048
03:30:57,160 --> 03:30:58,070
Sure?

4049
03:30:58,160 --> 03:30:59,650
Come on, Sethi sir.

4050
03:30:59,740 --> 03:31:00,990
Will anyone feel offended?

4051
03:31:01,080 --> 03:31:02,140
Say it.

4052
03:31:02,350 --> 03:31:03,610
Himansh, say it.

4053
03:31:03,740 --> 03:31:05,000
What are you going to say?

4054
03:31:06,150 --> 03:31:07,120
Say it.

4055
03:31:09,490 --> 03:31:11,220
You guys are rascals.

4056
03:31:13,590 --> 03:31:15,930
You cut off my water connection.

4057
03:31:18,530 --> 03:31:19,910
I reached office late.

4058
03:31:21,790 --> 03:31:22,960
Who does that?

4059
03:31:23,440 --> 03:31:25,220
Sorry, Mr. Sethi.

4060
03:31:25,530 --> 03:31:26,700
It was a mistake.

4061
03:31:27,290 --> 03:31:28,330
We did wrong.

4062
03:31:28,420 --> 03:31:30,380
[Mukul] Genuinely sorry, Sethi sir.

4063
03:31:31,790 --> 03:31:33,190
Apologize to me as well.

4064
03:31:34,400 --> 03:31:36,850
I organized a party at home
but no one showed up.

4065
03:31:36,940 --> 03:31:39,240
And all my food was wasted.

4066
03:31:39,730 --> 03:31:42,150
And plus we were taken
out of the WhatsApp group.

4067
03:31:42,240 --> 03:31:44,300
- Very bad.
- She is absolutely right.

4068
03:31:44,420 --> 03:31:47,410
And it's not a small mistake.
It's a big crime.

4069
03:31:47,500 --> 03:31:50,260
You made me miss Vandana's
delicious cooking.

4070
03:31:50,430 --> 03:31:52,670
And it's really worth regretting.

4071
03:31:53,270 --> 03:31:55,270
I second that. I second that.

4072
03:31:55,360 --> 03:31:56,780
Sorry, Vandana.

4073
03:31:57,330 --> 03:31:59,510
Done. I'll come over next time.

4074
03:31:59,600 --> 03:32:01,090
[Laughing]

4075
03:32:01,390 --> 03:32:03,350
[Vaibhav] Can I say something?

4076
03:32:04,300 --> 03:32:06,150
You're all my family now.

4077
03:32:06,800 --> 03:32:10,500
So it's not right to hide that I
don't have a job for two years now.

4078
03:32:10,740 --> 03:32:12,170
I'm sitting idle at home.

4079

You're not the only one.

4080
03:32:15,720 --> 03:32:17,600
Even I don't have a job.

4081
03:32:20,290 --> 03:32:23,300
And, even I'll be completely
useless from tomorrow.

4082
03:32:23,390 --> 03:32:26,030
- Right.
- We'll struggle together, cheers.

4083
03:32:26,290 --> 03:32:28,570
[Mukul] Two's better than one.
Not bad.

4084
03:32:29,070 --> 03:32:30,620
Himansh, let's go.

4085
03:32:31,000 --> 03:32:32,660
You have a flight to
catch tomorrow.

4086
03:32:32,750 --> 03:32:33,480
[Vandana] No.

4087
03:32:33,570 --> 03:32:34,760
What's the hurry,
sister-in-law Vandana?

4088

[Mukul] The night is young.

4089
03:32:36,080 --> 03:32:37,670
- No one's going anywhere.
- Let us go.

4090

[Vandana] Not at all.

4091

and get up in the morning?

The residents of Kala Kruti
Society have finally given up.

4104
03:35:29,710 --> 03:35:31,640
They don't have any option left.

4105

They are locking
their homes and leaving.

4106
03:35:34,510 --> 03:35:37,560
They must hand over their keys
to the Deputy Commissioner

4107
03:35:37,710 --> 03:35:40,140

process can be initiated.

you can carry this out, sir?

- Stop the JCB here.

03:38:47,700 --> 03:38:48,850
Really means a lot.

4143
03:38:49,560 --> 03:38:51,160
I wish Mohsin was here, but...

4144
03:38:51,990 --> 03:38:53,040
Are you mad?

4145
03:38:53,130 --> 03:38:55,270
There's no need to say thanks.

4146
03:38:56,230 --> 03:38:58,110
Thank you. Really means a lot.

4147
03:38:58,520 --> 03:39:00,120
[Woman]
Zulfiya Sheikh, your husband?

4148
03:39:10,580 --> 03:39:11,520
Thank you, Aunty.

4149
03:39:13,180 --> 03:39:14,440
I'll take care of her.

4150
03:39:16,070 --> 03:39:17,500
[Sighs]

4151
03:39:29,900 --> 03:39:30,890
I am sorry.

4152
03:39:36,540 --> 03:39:37,820
Motwani's.

4153
03:39:58,580 --> 03:40:01,740
- That's all 120.
- Yes, sir.

4154
03:40:05,230 --> 03:40:08,000
You guys can stay.
It's not 12 o'clock yet.

4155
03:40:22,800 --> 03:40:25,190
Mr. Sethi, I've tried my level best

4156
03:40:25,280 --> 03:40:28,210
but we've to accept that
the chances are very less.

4157
03:40:29,730 --> 03:40:30,830
Yes, sir. [Sighs]

4158
03:40:43,920 --> 03:40:45,010
Some tea?

4159
03:40:45,640 --> 03:40:47,030
No, thank you, sir.

4160
03:40:48,640 --> 03:40:50,100
Any message from dad?

4161
03:40:52,480 --> 03:40:56,620
After the last judgment, would
you like to give a new argument?

4162
03:40:56,710 --> 03:40:59,630
Your Honor,
the arguments are still the same.

4163
03:41:00,130 --> 03:41:03,920
We would like to make one last
request to the honorable court

4164
03:41:04,250 --> 03:41:08,280
to reconsider its last
judgment on humanitarian grounds.

4165
03:41:08,370 --> 03:41:12,280
Then, in that case, there
is nothing new to be reconsidered.

4166
03:41:12,370 --> 03:41:16,620
Your Honor, the applicant,
Mr. Himansh Sethi

4167
03:41:16,710 --> 03:41:19,230
would like to say something
to the honorable bench.

4168
03:41:19,320 --> 03:41:21,660
Why?
Do you have a new argument?

4169
03:41:23,550 --> 03:41:25,420
No, sir. I don't have an argument.

4170
03:41:28,390 --> 03:41:30,520
I just wanted to say something
that's on my mind.

4171
03:41:30,880 --> 03:41:33,680
Make way. Make way.

4172
03:41:35,370 --> 03:41:36,810
Did your papa call?

4173
03:41:38,340 --> 03:41:46,510
I saved money by staying hungry.

4174
03:41:46,890 --> 03:41:51,710
And bought a flat on EMI.

4175
03:41:53,410 --> 03:41:55,260
Felt like I've
finally settled down.

4176
03:41:57,140 --> 03:42:02,630
But then we found out
that it's illegal construction.

4177
03:42:03,360 --> 03:42:05,090
[Himansh] It wasn't our fault, sir.

4178
03:42:05,910 --> 03:42:07,690
We trusted the builder.

4179
03:42:08,540 --> 03:42:10,930
Why did the government give

4180
03:42:11,020 --> 03:42:13,780
permission to the builder
for that illegal construction?

4181
03:42:14,260 --> 03:42:17,890
And if the builder
didn't have permission

4182
03:42:18,040 --> 03:42:20,040
then why did he sell the flats?

4183
03:42:20,860 --> 03:42:25,670
Whereas the builder and the officer
are involved in this entire scam.

4184
03:42:26,680 --> 03:42:28,850
Then why are they
not in this court, sir?

4185
03:42:29,350 --> 03:42:30,810
Who is standing in the court?

4186
03:42:30,900 --> 03:42:33,400
A middle-class common man.

4187
03:42:34,180 --> 03:42:37,870
And all the members
of the Kala Kruti Society

4188
03:42:38,490 --> 03:42:40,380
kept paying every taxes.

4189
03:42:40,470 --> 03:42:42,960
We paid property tax,
electricity bill

4190
03:42:43,050 --> 03:42:45,280
water connection bill, gas bill.

4191
03:42:45,370 --> 03:42:48,090
If the construction was illegal,
then why accept it, sir?

4192
03:42:49,400 --> 03:42:54,060
A house is built of sand,
cement, stone.

4193
03:42:54,540 --> 03:42:56,150
Few rooms and pillars.

4194
03:42:57,520 --> 03:42:59,190
But in that house

4195
03:43:01,570 --> 03:43:05,530
when your mother-father, wife,
children come to live in that house

4196
03:43:05,620 --> 03:43:09,650
then that makes it... a home.

4197
03:43:11,980 --> 03:43:13,530
Sweet Home, sir.

4198
03:43:13,950 --> 03:43:20,640
And now our sweet home
is being destroyed.

4199
03:43:21,490 --> 03:43:23,410
Sir, your decision...

4200
03:43:25,360 --> 03:43:32,810
will make 500 Indians refugees
in their own country.

We must start our job.

[Mukul] Sir, please wait another
10 minutes.

Come on, start.

Sir, please wait
another 10 minutes.

4208
03:44:07,910 --> 03:44:09,190
The court will give its decision.
