1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,813
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:03,315
12th October, 1972

3
00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:08,593
A small chartered aircraft 
took off from Uruguay, South America.

4
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:12,708
This aircraft was going to 
Santiago, the capital of Chile.

5
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:16,986
Carrying some rugby players, tall and broad.

6
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:20,821
There were 45 passengers in total,

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,408
some of the players' family and friends had tagged along.

8
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:25,524
This flight was not going to be long.

9
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:29,806
Usually, it takes only 3 hours 
to go from Uruguay to Santiago.

10
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:34,205
But on the way, you come across the huge Andes Mountains.

11
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,898
The Andes Mountain Range in South America

12
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:39,269
is the world's longest mountain range.

13
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:40,995
Other than the Himalayan mountains,

14
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:43,629
the highest mountains are found here.

15
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:49,363
These beautiful mountains become 
devastating for the passengers in our story.

16
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:54,732
That day, on 12th October,

17
00:00:54,732 --> 00:00:56,278
there was a storm in the mountains.

18
00:00:56,278 --> 00:00:58,583
because of which, the plane couldn't keep flying.

19
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,406
The pilots then decided

20
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:01,987
to stop midway

21
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:04,861
and try to fly again the next day.

22
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:09,142
The plane landed in Mendoza, Argentina for the night.

23
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:11,278
The next day, on October 13th,

24
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:15,334
the plane took off again at 2:18 p.m.

25
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:17,821
The pilots ensured that the weather had cleared up.

26
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,227
So it was a smooth-sailing flight for the next hour.

27
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:24,916
At 3:21 p.m., the pilots start descending the plane.

28
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,601
The plane was quite close to Santiago

29
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,181
but was still in the mountains.

30
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:31,766
Since there are high mountains right next to the city.

31
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:35,989
While descending, suddenly there was terrible turbulence.

32
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:38,327
The plane started shaking horizontally.

33
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:41,274
Around this time, clouds gathered around the plane.

34
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:44,552
Nothing was visible except the clouds.

35
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:49,374
Suddenly, the alarms in the plane went off,

36
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:51,376
and the warning lights began to flash.

37
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:53,130
No one could understand why.

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,409
The rugby players in the passenger seats weren't scared.

39
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,243
They didn't take this turbulence seriously.

40
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,313
Amid jokes, a passenger looked out of the window

41
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:03,908
and saw the clouds clearing up.

42
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:06,591
But then he noticed that they were 
perilously close to a mountain.

43
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:09,035
As soon as the aircraft moved out of the clouds,

44
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:14,224
the pilots realized that they were moving towards a huge rock.

45
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:15,867
Immediately in a panic,

46
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:19,013
they try to lift the plane up.

47
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:26,684
The aircraft's ground collision alarm was ringing loudly.

48
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:30,873
Pilots put in maximum power into gaining altitude.

49
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:34,100
To fly over the mountain safely.

50
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,587
But unfortunately, it was too late.

51
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,753
The rear of the aircraft collided 
with the mountain while going up.

52
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:48,127
The entire rear portion of the plane separateed.

53
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,199
The two rows of seats at the back

54
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,880
literally, flew out of the plane.

55
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,216
Three passengers flew away with it and disappeared.

56
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:59,214
The plane kept flying upwards for a few more seconds

57
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:02,154
but then suddenly, it started to fall down.

58
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:04,210
After a few seconds, another collision happened.

59
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,824
The left wing of the plane broke.

60
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:10,114
Some more passengers flew 
out of the plane and fell down.

61
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:13,195
Now, only the front portion of the plane remained

62
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:15,331
and it fell into a glacier.

63
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:19,987
It slid down the glacier at a speed of 350 km/h

64
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:25,986
and finally, it crashed after dropping 700 meters.

65
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:30,198
Everything in the plane was destroyed.

66
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:33,943
The passenger seats were torn apart from the base of the plane.

67
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:37,096
The cockpit of the plane was completely crushed

68
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:39,522
and the pilots were killed immediately.

69
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:44,314
This aircraft lay broken on an 
unknown mountain in the Andes

70
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:47,083
at a height of 3,570 meters.

71
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,236
Surprisingly, out of the 45 people on board,

72
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:52,251
33 were still alive.

73
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:55,314
They had somehow survived this crash.

74
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:58,514
The problem was that many of them were injured

75
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:01,139
and no one knew where they were stuck.

76
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,575
It was later found that this plane

77
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:06,113
was 80 km off from its planned route.

78
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,233
And this painful story of survival

79
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,673
had just begun, friends.

80
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:12,279
Neither those people could have imagined at that time,

81
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:15,263
nor you can imagine now,

82
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:17,964
what happened to these survivors next.

83
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:20,185
This is the heart-wrenching story

84
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:23,064
of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571.

85
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,469
Let's know about it in today's video.

86
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:28,854
"Plane crashed in Andes Mountains.

87
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,604
45 persons were aboard.

88
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,596
Given up for d*ad."

89
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:34,014
"Survival fascinates people."

90
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,833
"All of the passengers were given up for d*ad."

91
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,700
"It became known as the Miracle of the Andes."

92
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,709
Right after this crash,

93
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,185
there were two survivors who weren't seriously injured.

94
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:50,706
First, 19-year-old Roberto Canessa

95
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:53,271
and the other, 20-year-old Gustavo Zerbino.

96
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,734
Since both of them were medical students,

97
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:58,705
they immediately started checking

98
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:01,650
who was alive and how to help the injured.

99
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,239
They saw that many passengers

100
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,972
had suffered severe injuries.

101
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,220
One of them was 23-year-old Fernando Parrado

102
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,099
who was in a coma due to a skull fracture.

103
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,480
These two medical students tried their best

104
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,791
to help the survivors.

105
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,454
On the other hand, within an hour of the plane's disappearance,

106
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,551
the Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service received a notification.

107
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:29,476
Four aircraft were deployed to search for the survivors.

108
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:33,223
They tried to find the crash site from dusk till night,

109
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,290
but unfortunately, they didn't find anything.

110
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,964
The rescue service officers concluded after hearing the radio transmissions

111
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:43,402
that the aircraft must have crashed in a remote and inaccessible area.

112
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:46,086
The problem was that the aircraft was white in colour

113
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:48,309
and it had crashed in a place where

114
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:51,563
there was white snow and ice all around.

115
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:55,823
It was very difficult to locate it in the snowy mountains.

116
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,250
On the night of 13th October,

117
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,410
the remaining passengers were very hopeful.

118
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,896
They hoped that if they would somehow spent a night there

119
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,286
and find a way to escape the cold

120
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:07,756
then someone would find them the next day.

121
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:11,787
Five injured passengers couldn't survive that snowy night.

122
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:16,182
The number of survivors fell from 33 to 28.

123
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:20,911
These survivors used the remaining body of the plane as a shelter.

124
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:24,209
They used luggage, seats, and snow

125
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,724
to close the rear of the plane

126
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:28,652
so that they could stay warm inside.

127
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,757
The next day, on 14th October,

128
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:36,809
11 different aircraft from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay,

129
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,635
were put into search operation.

130
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:41,644
The search area they chose was correct.

131
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:45,042
The location of the crash site was in that search area.

132
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:47,671
But still, they were not able to find the crash site.

133
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:54,004
Survivors tried to use lipstick to write SOS on the plane's roof.

134
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:55,772
They started writing SOS

135
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:57,683
but soon realized that

136
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,684
they didn't have enough lipstick to write all the letters.

137
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:06,179
Then they tried to use suitcases to make a big cross in the snow

138
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:10,232
so that search aircraft flying above could see them.

139
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:13,808
But soon they realized that this was not working.

140
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:19,203
That day, they saw not one, not two, but three aircraft flying over them.

141
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:22,865
They screamed, waved their hands and tried their best

142
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:25,084
to make the aircraft notice them,

143
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:26,464
but they were unsuccessful.

144
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:29,564
Another day passed in this attempt.

145
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:31,521
The next day, 15th October,

146
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,443
the survivors realized that

147
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:35,975
they needed water to stay alive.

148
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:38,209
A passenger, named Fito Strauch,

149
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,374
found a way to get water.

150
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:44,309
He used a metal sheet as a solar collector

151
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:46,735
so that the sunrays could be concentrated

152
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:47,935
to melt the snow.

153
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,896
And he collected water droplets in empty wine bottles.

154
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:57,751
Apart from this, many passengers used the seat cushions like snowshoes

155
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:01,817
and the wool in the seat covers was used

156
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:03,706
to protect them from the cold.

157
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:05,584
The next day, on 16th October,

158
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,271
three days after the crash,

159
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,991
Fernando Parrado woke up from his coma.

160
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,501
As soon as he regained consciousness,

161
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:14,651
he saw that his mother passed away in the crash

162
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:18,422
and his 19-year-old sister was severely injured.

163
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:21,509
Parrado tried his best to keep his sister alive,

164
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,607
he brought food and water for her.

165
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:26,535
But as the days went by,

166
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:28,159
8 days after the crash,

167
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,897
his sister succumbed to her injuries.

168
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:34,080
Such accidents remind us

169
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,032
how uncertain life is,

170
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:37,462
and how unpredictable it is.

171
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:40,433
We don't know how long we will live.

172
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:41,938
That's why it is said,

173
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,380
Live every moment.

174
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,818
Live every day, every moment in your life,

175
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,519
because who knows, tomorrow may not come.

176
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,296
But there's also the question of

177
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,280
how?

178
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,037
In our daily lives,

179
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:54,590
considering other tensions like work,

180
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,475
how can one find time for things one likes?

181
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:59,738
This is what I have explained

182
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,019
in my Time Management course.

183
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,534
In this course, I have told you step-by-step techniques

184
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:07,252
on how you can not only double your productivity

185
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:09,259
but also double your happiness.

186
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:12,410
The same tricks which I use in my life

187
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,458
and because of which I can make so many videos

188
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,074
while travelling around the world.

189
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:18,052
If you haven't joined this course yet,

190
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,473
then do try it

191
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:21,193
because the people who took this course

192
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,168
found it to be life-changing.

193
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:25,384
Some of the reviews can be seen on the screen

194
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:26,936
and if you are interested in joining,

195
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:30,084

because I really think that this course

203
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:48,445
can change your life.

204
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:49,979
Just remember one thing,

205
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:51,819
the course is in English.

206
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:53,341
Now, let's get back to the topic.

207
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:57,210
Most of the passengers were from coastal areas.

208
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,745
Before this, they had never seen snow.

209
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:03,369
And now, suddenly, in the cold of -30° Celsius,

210
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,187
at such a high altitude without proper food and water,

211
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:10,206
they were somehow surviving.

212
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,496
In these bad conditions, there was another problem.

213
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:13,726
Snow blindness.

214
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:18,043
When the ultraviolet rays of the sun reflect 
on the snow and ice in the mountains,

215
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,287
it can damage your eyes.

216
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,203
This is called snow blindness.

217
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:25,678
These survivors had only 3 pairs of sunglasses.

218
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:28,682
On 21st October, 8 days after the crash,

219
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:32,023
search and rescue teams gave up.

220
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:36,900
They believed that since they could not find any signs of survivors in those 8 days,

221
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,899
there was no point in continuing the search operation.

222
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,576
There was little chance that anyone could have survived after so many days.

223
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,030
So, after 142 hours of search operation,

224
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,676
this search operation was officially stopped.

225
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:54,641
Meanwhile, the survivors found a transistor radio

226
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:56,564
among the seats of the aircraft.

227
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,744
A survivor rugby player, Roy Harley,

228
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,968
was also an electronics enthusiast.

229
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:03,802
So he tried to switch on the radio.

230
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:06,685
He made a long antennae by improvising.

231
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:10,139
And because of his efforts, finally, the radio started working.

232
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,839
This radio could communicate one way only.

233
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,449
The survivors could hear things

234
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:18,968
but could not send any messages.

235
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:22,280
They turned on the radio 11 days after the crash

236
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,255
and then they came to know that

237
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:27,022
the search operation had been cancelled.

238
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:29,716
Their hearts were completely broken.

239
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:32,476
Some people start crying after hearing this news.

240
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:35,485
Some people clasped their hands and started praying to God.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,887
"Feeling that their world is alive

242
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:40,190
and they consider you dead."

243
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,516
Fernando Parrado was the only one who did not react much after hearing this news.

244
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:47,662
Because he was planning something else.

245
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:51,647
By the 11th day, survivors were running out of food.

246
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:54,468
They didn't have much to begin with.

247
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,558
There were only 8 chocolate bars,

248
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,063
1 tin of mussels,

249
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,004
3 small jars of jam,

250
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:01,007
a jar of almonds.

251
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:05,317
A box of peanuts, some dates, candies, dried plums

252
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:06,555
and a few bottles of wine.

253
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:10,524
A few days after the crash, they started rationing food.

254
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:12,716
They ate very little each day.

255
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:16,608
Parrado ate a chocolate-covered peanut for 3 days.

256
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,246
Just one peanut.

257
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:21,708
But rationing was not enough.

258
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,400
Because the food was almost over.

259
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,789
There were no trees or plants at an altitude of 3,800 meters,

260
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,414
nor were there any animals that could be killed and eaten.

261
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:33,415
By the 11th day, the food was completely gone

262
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:36,752
and some people tried to eat some parts of the plane.

263
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:39,728
They tried eating the cotton in the seats

264
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:42,025
and the leather on the seats.

265
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:43,914
But this made them more sick.

266
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:48,184
In such a situation, when there was 
no option other than starving to d*ath,

267
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,441
these survivors did something

268
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,162
that will shock you.

269
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:54,771
To stay alive, they decided

270
00:12:54,771 --> 00:13:00,732
there was no option other than eating 
the d*ad bodies of their friends and family.

271
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:02,625
It was not an easy decision to make.

272
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,378
Because most of the people who were k*lled in this crash

273
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:09,584
were friends, classmates, family members, or relatives.

274
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,293
"We have to eat.

275
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:12,666
and the only probable things 

276
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,047
were the d*ad bodies 
of the people that were in this plane."

277
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:16,608
Since Canessa came up with this idea,

278
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,685
he was the first to try it.

279
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:22,525
Some others tried to, but they couldn't.

280
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,366
They refused then.

281
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:26,092
But 2 days later,

282
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:28,097
with no other option,

283
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:31,875
finally, even they chose to eat human meat.

284
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,190
On 29th October, 16 days after the crash,

285
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,128
this food source was also depleting rapidly for the survivors.

286
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:46,127
They had no plan of action.

287
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,560
No one knew what to do next.

288
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,897
The situation could not have been worse.

289
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,263
But then that night,

290
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:55,969
they heard a loud grumble.

291
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:59,486
It turned out to be an avalanche.

292
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:02,369
Large amount of snow was descending so fast from the mountain top,

293
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:06,016
that it filled the broken plane with snow.

294
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:21,725
Eight people were lost in the snow and suffocated.

295
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,498
Only 19 survivors remained.

296
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:28,157
"Ted, Roberto, you had it. 
You're going to d!e.

297
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:29,416
That's it.

298
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,816
A very nice sensation of heat between my legs

299
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:34,424
because I was peeing on myself

300
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:35,396
and saying that's it."

301
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:39,827
These remaining 19 people were also 
trapped in a small space under the snow.

302
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:42,649
Parrado used a metal pole

303
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,265
to make a hole in the snow,

304
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:47,325
to allow some ventilation.

305
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,171
After working hard for two days,

306
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:52,664
they dug a tunnel under the snow

307
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:55,754
and with great difficulty, they managed to get to the surface.

308
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:57,526
As soon as they got out,

309
00:14:57,526 --> 00:15:00,069
they saw a snowstorm was coming

310
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:06,034
and it would be prudent to go back 
into the snow cave to survive.

311
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:08,090
For the next three days, the remaining survivors,

312
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,352
somehow managed to stay in the cramped space.

313
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,959
3 days later, they went back up to the surface

314
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,317
and the weather was clear.

315
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:18,207
After coming out, the survivors realized that

316
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:20,597
no one was coming to save them.

317
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:22,490
If they wanted to stay alive,

318
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,571
they would need to put in the efforts themselves.

319
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:28,901
There was no point in sitting at the crash site, waiting for help.

320
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:32,034
They needed to try their best till the last breath.

321
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,671
Canessa, Parrado, and Vizintin

322
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,445
were among the strongest survivors.

323
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:37,537
They decided together

324
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:42,231
to give them more food and the warmest clothes

325
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:48,285
and they would try to walk around looking for help.

326
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:50,490
The first task was to estimate the location.

327
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,174
Before the crash,

328
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:53,873
the co-pilot had stated that

329
00:15:53,873 --> 00:15:56,989
their aircraft had passed through Curico.

330
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,949
So they estimated that

331
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:01,538
if they walked a few kilometres to the west

332
00:16:01,538 --> 00:16:05,610
they would definitely reach some countryside areas of Chile.

333
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,571
But their estimation was extremely wrong.

334
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,390
Actually, the co-pilot didn't know

335
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,566
where he was taking the plane.

336
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,691
In reality, their crash site

337
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,809
was 89 km east,

338
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,996
in the middle of the Andes mountains.

339
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:20,977
Still, unaware of this,

340
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:23,331
they rested for a few days to build up their energy.

341
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:27,185
On November 15, 33 days after the crash,

342
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:30,285
these three people set out to find help.

343
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:32,423
After travelling for hours towards the east,

344
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:36,755
they found the rear piece of their aircraft.

345
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:39,126
It was the part of the plane that had broken apart first.

346
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:42,391
Inside it, they found many suitcases,

347
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:44,886
boxes of chocolates, three meat patties,

348
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:46,819
a bottle of rum, extra clothes,

349
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,867
comic books, and some medicines.

350
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:50,842
And along with this, they found

351
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:53,617
the aircraft's two-way radio system.

352
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:56,460
A radio that can not only facilitate incoming communication,

353
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,655
but can also send messages.

354
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:01,411
They decided to spend the night there.

355
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:02,664
The next day of the expedition,

356
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:05,011
they walk a little further east,

357
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:07,339
but after discussing it, they believed that

358
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,251
they should try to turn on the aircraft's radio.

359
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:15,157
They decided to get some batteries out of the main body of the aircraft

360
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:17,608
and then try to start the radio.

361
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:20,339
They would be able to send out an SOS call.

362
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,624
They found 24 kg batteries in the tail section,

363
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:25,079
but it was very heavy.

364
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,646
They could not carry it back to the main body crash site.

365
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:33,477
So they decided to try to turn it on right there.

366
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:36,086
They went back and took the help of Roy Harley

367
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:38,038
the one who had some knowledge of electronics

368
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:42,103
but unfortunately, this plan didn't work.

369
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,378
The thing was that

370
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:44,982
the aircraft's electrical system

371
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,757
worked with a 115V AC

372
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:51,203
and their battery was a 24V DC.

373
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,946
They had no means to connect them.

374
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:57,489
They tried their best to start the radio for a few days

375
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:01,245
but soon realized that there was no other way.

376
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:06,086
To survive, they now had to start walking Westwards.

377
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,600
On 11th December, 59 days after the crash,

378
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,597
an avalanche hit.

379
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:18,068
Three more survivors were k!lled in it.

380
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:21,030
"I was trapped completely by the storm, the avalanche,

381
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,198
it was the most d*adly silence that you may imagine.

382
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:26,072
I couldn't move..."

383
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:28,683
Only 16 remained.

384
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:31,742
To climb the mountains in the west,

385
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:34,350
they needed a way to sleep at night.

386
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,446
How could they survive the cold nights of -30° Celsius?

387
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,924
Among the survivors was an 18-year-old boy,

388
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:42,545
Carlos Miguel Rodriguez.

389
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:47,604
He remembered that his mother had taught him to sew with needles.

390
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:50,755
He was carrying his needles and sewing kit with him.

391
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:55,875
His idea was to stitch different pieces of clothing

392
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,807
to make a big sleeping bag.

393
00:18:57,807 --> 00:18:59,571
"I had the idea that with the insulation,

394
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,981
you can make a sleeping bag.

395
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:02,740
But I not only had the idea,

396
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,961
I made it myself."

397
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,316
They did this.

398
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:08,090
The next day, December 12,

399
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,188
two months had passed since the day this crash happened.

400
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:15,565
These three brave men, Parrado, Canessa, and Vizintin,

401
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:18,443
set out without any mountaineering gear

402
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:20,592
to climb the glacier.

403
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,000
"The only certain thing was
to the West was Chile."

404
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:26,274
Going westward meant that

405
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:28,515
they would have to climb the mountain first

406
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:30,167
before going down.

407
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:31,781
They still believed that

408
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,466
they were only a few kilometres away.

409
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:38,118
So they hoped that they would find help by walking for 2-3 days.

410
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:40,929
So they packed a 3-day supply of meat.

411
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,547
"And you can imagine

412
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,383
without any skill, without any training,

413
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,011
you're like a child!

414
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:48,150
You are confronted with a snowstorm,

415
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,323
you try to go straight up,

416
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,190
you might be using your hands and your feet,

417
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,225
you're slipping and sliding.

418
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,627
And with every step that you go up,

419
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,474
you slide back half a step."

420
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:04,951
To protect himself against the cold, Parrado wore three pairs of jeans.

421
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:07,892
He was also wearing 3 sweaters on top of his t-shirt,

422
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:10,683
and 4 pairs of socks on his feet.

423
00:20:10,683 --> 00:20:13,311
He was also wearing a plastic shopping bag over the socks.

424
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,361
The cold was so bad.

425
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:16,978
They had no technical gear,

426
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:19,327
no map, no compass,

427
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,782
and no climbing experience.

428
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:24,466
And at this height, the air gets quite thin,

429
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,584
and one starts feeling the lack of oxygen.

430
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,234
But despite that,

431
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:31,220
they kept moving forward towards the mountain.

432
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:36,666
The sleeping bag they had stitched

433
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,099
was useful at night.

434
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,136
During the day, they kept moving forward, taking slow steps.

435
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,446
The three of them, in that one sleeping bag,

436
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:49,986
slept as close to each other as possible.

437
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:52,382
And as soon as the sun rose, they started walking.

438
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:58,008
Gradually, they kept moving forward together.

439
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,490
The second day, the third day,

440
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,331
and on the morning of the fourth day, they realized that

441
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,565
their estimation was grossly wrong.

442
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:11,362
Ahead, they could see no end to their journey.

443
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:13,153
Because they had little to no food,

444
00:21:13,153 --> 00:21:17,081
Vizintin decided to return to the crash site

445
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:19,594
and only the other two would go ahead

446
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:21,390
so that less food was needed.

447
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,743
On 15th December, Vizintin started going back

448
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,804
which was easier

449
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:28,558
because it was all downhill.

450
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,541
He used an aircraft seat as a sleigh

451
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,740
and within an hour he reached the crash site.

452
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,620
It took them three days to climb this mountain

453
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,225
but in just one hour,

454
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:41,912
he was back at the crash site.

455
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:46,015
Parrado and Canessa kept climbing the mountain.

456
00:21:46,015 --> 00:21:47,757
After three hours,

457
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:49,583
they reached the peak of the mountain

458
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,392
and saw that all around them,

459
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:55,300
there was only mountains as far as they could see.

460
00:21:56,745 --> 00:22:00,299
There was nothing except the snowy mountains.

461
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:02,926
"I couldn't breathe.

462
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:04,306
I couldn't speak,

463
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:05,766
I couldn't even think

464
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,614
because what we saw was horrible.

465
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:09,205
Instead of green valleys,

466
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:11,050
we saw mountains

467
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,445
and snow-covered peaks

468
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:14,226
360° around us,

469
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:16,837
to the horizon, all around us."

470
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:23,306
With great difficulty, Parrado tried to find something else to see.

471
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:25,697
On the far western horizon,

472
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:28,452
they saw two mountains peaks

473
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:29,787
without snow.

474
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,361
They assumed that they should keep travelling in that direction.

475
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:36,726
They couldn't give up.

476
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:41,561
Parrado and Canessa keep hiking for many days.

477
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:44,133
Finally, they reached a valley.

478
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:47,881
A valley where they could see a river flowing.

479
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,723
In this situation, reaching the river was a great relief.

480
00:22:55,723 --> 00:22:58,516
Because while travelling downstream the river,

481
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:01,145
it was easy to find a downhill path.

482
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,509
They kept on walking and walking.

483
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:07,051
And finally, after trekking for 9 days,

484
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:08,749
on 20th December,

485
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,425
they could find some presence of humans.

486
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,650
They could see some cows in the fields.

487
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,899
They were so tired by this point

488
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:19,427
that they couldn't walk farther.

489
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:22,015
Right then, on the other side of the river,

490
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:25,401
"Look, a man on a horse!"

491
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:27,850
They saw 3 men on horses.

492
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,379
Parrado tried to shout.

493
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:33,891
But the river was so loud, that those people couldn't hear him.

494
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:38,639
But by chance, one of them spotted Parrado and Canessa.

495
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:41,643
He looked at them and shouted back.

496
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:43,064
"Tomorrow!"

497
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:45,875
He said that he would be back the next day.

498
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,813
The next day, the man comes back on horseback

499
00:23:48,813 --> 00:23:52,157
and this time brought some paper and pencils with him.

500
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:56,994
He attached the paper and pencil to a stone with a thread

501
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:59,891
and threw it to the other side of the river.

502
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:05,316
For the first time, Parrado had the opportunity to send his message to the world.

503
00:24:05,316 --> 00:24:08,738
Parado wrote in Spanish on the paper,

504
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,220
"I come from a plane that fell in the mountains."

505
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,883
That he was from Uruguay.

506
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:15,611
And had been walking for 10 days.

507
00:24:15,611 --> 00:24:18,616
And that his injured friends were at the crash site.

508
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:20,612
He wrote that they needed help urgently,

509
00:24:20,612 --> 00:24:22,737
but didn't know how to get help.

510
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:24,185
They didn't have any food.

511
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:25,209
They were weak.

512
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,175
And they didn't have it in them to walk anymore.

513
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,284
He asked to be saved.

514
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:29,400
He asked where they were.

515
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,166
On the other hand, the person who received this message

516
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,125
was a farmer from Chile,

517
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,199
Sergio Catalan.

518
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,670
He read this note

519
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,394
and told him with gestures that he understood.

520
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,029
After talking to his two friends,

521
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:44,916
it turned out that they did remember vaguely.

522
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,773
A few months ago, they had heard on the news that a plane crashed.

523
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:50,741
And when these friends realized this,

524
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,558
they were shocked.

525
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,761
They couldn't believe that there were 
survivors of a 2-month-old plane crash.

526
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,796
Sergio threw a piece of bread to the other side of the river

527
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:01,524
and for the next 10 hours,

528
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:05,905
on a horse, he rode towards west.

529
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:09,986
They were still so far from any village or human settlement.

530
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:12,664
Finally, when he reached the nearest city,

531
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:16,381
the army command was informed about this

532
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:20,197
and he contacted the army headquarters in Santiago.

533
00:25:20,197 --> 00:25:26,083
Meanwhile, the farmers brought Parrado and Canessa to Los Maitenes on horses.

534
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,801
Where they finally get some rest.

535
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:31,365
It was found that on sheer will,

536
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:36,188
they had hiked 61 km on foot over the last 10 days.

537
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:39,397
Canessa had lost half of his body weight.

538
00:25:39,397 --> 00:25:42,724
He weighed only 44 kgs then.

539
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:45,732
As soon as other people got to know about their story,

540
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:48,226
it became international news.

541
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,150
This heart-wrenching story was truly unbelievable.

542
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,734
The Chilean Air Force sends 3 helicopters to immediately rescue the survivors.

543
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:08,828
Army officers interviewed Parrado and Canessa

544
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,954
to get information about the location.

545
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:14,191
Parrado had brought the pilot's flight chart with him

546
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:17,268
and he had plotted the places where they were hiking.

547
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:20,305
Army officers took him with them on the helicopter

548
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:22,651
to locate the crash site.

549
00:26:22,651 --> 00:26:25,787
With Parrado's help, the location of the remaining survivors

550
00:26:25,787 --> 00:26:28,691
was finally discovered by the army commanders.

551
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:31,578
On 22nd December 1972,

552
00:26:31,578 --> 00:26:34,205
70 days after the crash,

553
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:38,274
two search and rescue helicopters finally reached

554
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:41,631
the survivors to save their lives.

555
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,149
In total, 16 survivors were rescued.

556
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:53,164
They were in a terrible condition.

557
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:55,326
Altitude sickness, dehydration,

558
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:57,599
broken bones, malnutrition.

559
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,946
But all of them recovered.

560
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:03,431
This story is a lesson to the world about hope.

561
00:27:03,431 --> 00:27:06,015
If you have decided to do something

562
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:09,013
and you have patience and humanity,

563
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:11,584
then nothing is impossible.

564
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:14,185
If you want, you can achieve things

565
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:16,763
that you can never even dream of.

566
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:19,616
As they say, "Where there's a will, there's a way."

567
00:27:19,616 --> 00:27:22,455
That's why there is another name for this disaster

568
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:24,639
the Miracle of the Andes.

569
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:27,299
If you liked the video, I have made many more videos

570
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:29,313
on the stories of such plane crashes.

571
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:33,331
Like this one, India's most horrific plane crash.

572
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:35,019

573
