1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,650
- I tied up an FBI agent.
(words pop)

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,840
If he steals this hundred
thousand dollars from me

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,520
before midnight, he keeps it.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,353
This is a knife.

5
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:07,500
Good luck. Let's go, Tareq.

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,640
- [The Boys] Oh, oh, what do we do?

7
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,473
- [Tareq] Oh my gosh, we gotta go.

8
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:10,980
- [Jimmy] Tareq, our first
stop's through the woods.

9
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,480
- [Tareq] Jimmy, why are we
doing this again already?

10
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,000
- Relax for one second.
I've been tied up before.

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
- [Chris] He's getting
so much time ahead of us.

12
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,420
- [Jimmy] We're coming out
the other side of the woods.

13
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,590
Our getaway car is over here.

14
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,580
- [Tareq] Whoa, that's a nice car, Jim.

15
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,660
- [Jimmy] The car matches my bag.

16
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,103
- [Tareq] We gotta go. We gotta go.

17
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,080
- [Chris] How are you gonna catch him

18
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,520
if your hands are tied?

19
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,990
- And now we drive down this path.

20
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,510
You guys have no idea what I
have in store for the boys.

21
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,930
I rented an NFL football
stadium, an island, a maze,

22
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,490
and tons of other cool things.

23
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,323
And stop!

24
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:37,530
- [Tareq] Oh! Why are we stopping already?

25
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,363
- Just watch.

26
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:39,720
You see this giant telephone pole?

27
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,553
- [Tareq] Uh huh.

28
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:42,063
- Watch this.

29
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,929
- [Tareq] Oh, oh, oh my gosh-

30
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,120
- Let's get back in the car.

31
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,620
(car revving)

32
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,010
- Buckle up.

33
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,972
- Now there's a giant telephone
pole blocking the exit.

34
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:53,805
- [The Boys] Oh.

35
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:54,638
- Oh, here we go.

36
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,650
- [The Boys] Hurry.

37
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,909
- Grab on. Push it over.

38
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:58,590
- Ohh!
- Push go.

39
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,550
- [Karl] Guys, hurry up!

40
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,290
- We put a GPS in my underwear

41
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,170
so the FBI agent and the boys
will always know where I'm at.

42
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,280
- [Nolan] Jimmy turned.

43
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,150
- [Chris] Oh, wait, he turned?

44
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,990
- [Nolan] He turned left.

45
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,220
- If you zoom in-

46
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,053
- It's a maze!

47
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:09,886
- It's a maze!

48
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:11,730
It gives us the layout of the maze.

49
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,563
- We're now at the Hedge Maze

50
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:14,010
and I got the hundred thousand dollars.

51
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,810
Look at how huge this maze is.

52
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,030
We gotta be careful because
it'd be easy to get lost

53
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,211
and for them to catch us in here.

54
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:20,087
- [Jimmy] Uh, I think it's this way.

55
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:21,870
- [Tareq] Okay...Uh, how do you know?

56
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,250
- I've done this maze like 10 times,

57
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,250
but the boys have never been here.

58
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,891
- We're just gonna push him and push him,

59
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,420
get him out of the area,

60
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,190
and then as he's tiring,
we'll handle this.

61
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,270
- I'm gonna leave them some money here

62
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,470
so they know they're going the right way.

63
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,941
Or a random person's
just gonna find a grand.

64
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:33,774
(Jimmy chuckles)

65
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:34,607
- [The Boys] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

66
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:35,884
- [Nolan] It says open 11 to five.

67
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:38,443
- [Kurt] See if we can
actually get right through it.

68
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:39,309
- [Chris] Ooh.

69
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:40,142
- [Kurt] Here we go.

70
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:40,975
- [Jimmy] It was right,
right, left, right,

71
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,150
left, right, right, left.

72
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,983
Perfect. Okay.

73
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:44,070
If you're in the cave,
you're in the right spot,

74
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,030
which means if we go here,

75
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,770
now we are officially in the watch tower.

76
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,450
We can see the entire maze.

77
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,470
- I'm gonna do a perimeter check.

78
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,430
Make sure he is not outside.

79
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,720
We gotta find the getaway car.

80
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,100
- Hey Karl, come on.

81
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,562
- There's that nerd.
- Hey, there he is!

82
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:55,395
- Ooh!
- Okay!

83
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:56,340
- [Jimmy] I bet you can't get me.

84
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,860
- Ooh. The only exit is right here.

85
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,750
- [Chris] Why is there money over here?

86
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,583
- That was just to let you know

87
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,850
you were going the right way.

88
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,290
- [Chris] Jimmy, we're almost there.

89
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,123
Just wait.

90
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:06,029
- Oh, they are getting close.

91
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:07,286
Shoot, okay. We gotta go, we gotta go.

92
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:08,119
They're getting closer.

93
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,431
I don't know how long I
planned on staying there.

94
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:10,264
(Tareq laughs)

95
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,097
- [Chris] He's older than us,

96
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,240
but he's got so much more energy.

97
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,367
Isn't this where Jimmy was?

98
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,220
- [Kurt] Yes, it was.

99
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,620
- I know you're looking at this, Jimmy.

100
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,880
I'm taking your camera now.

101
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,800
- The only exit outside
of this entire maze

102
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,700
is all the way up there,

103
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,440
which is why yesterday
we put in a secret door.

104
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,570
- [Tareq] Oh wow. Jimmy, this is crazy.

105
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,800
Wait, Jimmy, is that our getaway car?

106
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,750
- Notice how this says,
"Authorized Maze Personnel Only".

107
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,697
Now it says, "Jimmy's Getaway Car".

108
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,024
- [Kurt] Hey guys, let's
go back to the car.

109
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,050
The tracker's showing him up on the hill.

110
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,118
- [Karl] All right. To the car!

111
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:36,099
- [The Boys] Let's go!
- [Kurt] Let's go-

112
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,304
- [Karl] Go, go, go, go, go.
- [Nolan] Get in.

113
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:39,390
- I wonder if they've noticed
we're not in the maze anymore.

114
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,530
- [Nolan] He's getting on the highway.

115
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,363
- [Chris] Which way? Left or right?

116
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:42,210
- Right.
- Right.

117
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,286
- We can make all the
mistakes in the world-

118
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:44,119
- Doesn't matter-

119
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:44,952
- He's just gotta make one-

120
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:45,785
- He gotta make one.

121
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:46,618
- Yeah.

122
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:48,270
- Yo, there were parts where
we were so close to them

123
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,103
in the maze.

124
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:49,936
That was terrifying.

125
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:50,769
If they would've caught us there,

126
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,230
this video would've been
only like two minutes.

127
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,063
I made a mistake.

128
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:54,480
Tareq's supposed to be
driving. Let's switch.

129
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,313
- [Tareq] Let's switch.

130
00:02:55,313 --> 00:02:56,520
- Karl is the, is that money real?

131
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,020
- Oh, it's real real.

132
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,853
- Oh good.

133
00:02:58,853 --> 00:02:59,686
(boys laughing)

134
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:00,519
- And the reason Tareq is driving,

135
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,352
is because I need to put on a disguise.

136
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:04,184
(soft, exciting music)

137
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,157
I look so old.

138
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:08,370
Now we put the hat on, throw
on a pair of glasses, and boom.

139
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,420
I'm Boomer Jim.

140
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,530
And we're heading to Walmart

141
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,690
where I'm gonna try to
blend in with normal people.

142
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,580
- Do you think he went to the mall to shop

143
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,750
and we all go shopping?

144
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,490
- We're pulling up to Walmart
and I'm gonna go inside

145
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,350
with the hundred thousand
dollars and the tracker.

146
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,640
There's a pickax back here.

147
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,050
And while they're inside searching for me,

148
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,270
you need to pop all the tires
on their car to strand them.

149
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,830
- Jimmy, I've never
popped a tire in my life.

150
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,663
- Let's do this.

151
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:27,551
- [Chris] Wait. It says
we're on top of him-

152
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,384
- [The Boys] Hey!

153
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,217
- [Kurt] Yeah. It says
we're right on top of him-

154
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:30,276
- Take a, take a right down here-

155
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,109
- [Karl] He's right here.

156
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,190
- Don't let me down
with popping the tires.

157
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,090
- [Tareq] I won't. God speed.

158
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,850
- Park away from cars and
let's assess the situation.

159
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,720
- And now I'm inside Walmart.

160
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,700
And before I blend in, I
need to disguise this bag.

161
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,650
Now I'm gonna take the hundred
thousand dollar backpack

162
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,722
and put it in this bag.

163
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,440
Now they'll never catch me.

164
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,550
- You and I will go inside.

165
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,930
You two stay, stay together.

166
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,190
And let's see if we can search 'em out.

167
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,660
Inside! Hold his hand, there ya go.

168
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,677
- We're staying together.

169
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:50,610
(phone ringing)

170
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,443
- Are they here yet?

171
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:53,430
- They're walking out right
now. They're going inside.

172
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,330
- All right. They're going inside?

173
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,163
- Yes, yes, yes.
(phone call ends)

174
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:56,043
- The boys are about to
come inside. We gotta go.

175
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:57,630
- [Tareq] They have no idea

176
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm gonna smash all their tires.

177
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,690
Look at 'em running.

178
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,110
- [Chris] Looking for a six foot four guy,

179
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,640
with a weird beard.

180
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,900
- I can literally see the boys

181
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,040
walking down the gaming aisle.

182
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,690
- I know that Jimmy told
me to pop all the tires,

183
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,523
but I'm just gonna do one.

184
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:12,180
Cuz I think I'm running low on time.

185
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,308
FBI? More like, FB flat tire!

186
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,199
(air hissing)

187
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,940
(Tareq running)

188
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,780
Oh, I gotta get the camera.

189
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,230
- He's not walking around
anywhere. He's gotta be hiding.

190
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,063
(phone ringing)

191
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:22,896
- [Jimmy] Did you do the deed?

192
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,729
- The deed is done.

193
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,930
- They're so close to me.
I'm getting outta here.

194
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,800
- [Tareq] Hurry up, grandpa.

195
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,970
- I can't believe that worked.

196
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,220
They were literally one
aisle beside me at one point.

197
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,360
- What's the tracker say?

198
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,920
- [Kurt] The tracker's
moving. The vehicle's moved.

199
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,753
- Wait, it's moving?
- In the parking lot?

200
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:34,230
- He's outta the...he's outta Walmart?

201
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,480
- It feels amazing to have that mask off.

202
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,860
We've knocked over a telephone pole,

203
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,300
had a goose chase through a maze,

204
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,490
and then hid in a Walmart as an old man.

205
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,810
And the video's just getting started.

206
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,550
I have so much more cool stuff planned.

207
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,050
Like I'm literally heading to the airport

208
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,760
to board a private jet right now.

209
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,593
- Wait a second!
- What's that?

210
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:52,020
Who popped our tires?
There's a pickax in our tire.

211
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,730
- Well, if we don't have a
car, we're gonna change a flat.

212
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,766
- [Nolan] Do you know
how to change a tire?

213
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,130
- Of course I know how to change a tire.

214
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,102
- [Chris] Remember you wanna go two or-

215
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:58,179
(car falling)

216
00:04:58,179 --> 00:04:59,416
Yeah. That's why I don't like those jacks.

217
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,360
- [Kurt] Yep.

218
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,193
- Karl?

219
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:02,026
- [Karl] Yeah?

220
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:03,210
- Do you know where I
was hiding at Walmart?

221
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,043
- No!

222
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:05,700
- Basically I put on an old man suit,

223
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,650
changed my clothes, and used a cane.

224
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,690
Did you see a really old guy limping?

225
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,763
- I don't pay attention to old people.

226
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:13,140
- Well if you did see one
in Walmart, it was me.

227
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,040
Good luck, nerd!

228
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,873
(phone call ends)

229
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:15,706
- Brah!

230
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:16,539
(Chris groaning)

231
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:17,372
- [Nolan] Chris, you working hard?

232
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:18,840
- [Chris] You're hardly working.

233
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,860
- We're getting close to the airport.

234
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,660
I'm gonna call the private jet
and make sure they're ready.

235
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,640
- It looks like he's on a taxiing runway.

236
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,590
- He's gonna get in a plane and fly away.

237
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,787
- This is why he slashed the tires.

238
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:29,340
- And there's our private jet. Let's go.

239
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,380
I'm getting on a private
jet with the dumbest outfit

240
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,520
and a Cars backpack.

241
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,720
What am I doing with my life?

242
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,770
Come on. You're taking forever.

243
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,170
I'm gonna try to time it where
the private jet takes off

244
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,390
when they get here so they
can see me flying away.

245
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,320
- What's up, Jimmy?

246
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
- Hey buddy. How far away are you?

247
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,580
- We're at the Walmart
man. Still fixing the tire.

248
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,417
- Okay. Well-

249
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,180
- Hey Jimmy, if you had to
pick a terminal to go into,

250
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,920
would it be the passenger terminal?-

251
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,210
- Oh, so that means you're here.

252
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,440
Pilot, you can take off.

253
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,593
- [Chris] Run, run, run.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

254
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:57,000
(upbeat music)

255
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,950
- [Kurt] Last door.

256
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,930
- Later, nerds.

257
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,280
- That's him.

258
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,968
That's him on that jet right there.

259
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:04,953
- [Karl] Dude!

260
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,420
- I have no idea how they're
gonna track where we're going.

261
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,350
- We're gonna follow the airplane.

262
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,610
Let's check inside where it's going.

263
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,540
- Can we just do that?

264
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,680
- Yes. Why not?

265
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,850
- Oh. I guess he is FBI.

266
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,683
- How you doing? FBI.

267
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:17,997
Where did the airplane that
just left, where is it going?

268
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:19,177
- Uh. Washington, D.C..

269
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:20,010
(boys gasp)

270
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,090
- [The Boys] What!
- Wonderful.

271
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,830
- Is there another flight
to Washington, D.C.?

272
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,663
- [Kurt] Anytime soon.

273
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:25,303
- I don't see anything today. No.

274
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:27,210
- Do we have to drive all
the way to Washington, D.C.?

275
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,067
That's like-
- Hey, at least we got-

276
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:28,900
- Three hours!

277
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,910
- We gotta, we gotta new
tire for it. So we're good.

278
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,750
- New tire. Let's go.

279
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,400
- Private jet with stacks of money?

280
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,250
For the first time ever, I
actually feel like a YouTuber.

281
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,040
And now we're in Washington, D.C..

282
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,570
We got about a three hour lead.

283
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,580
And conveniently our driver is Nick.

284
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,140
You might remember him from this video.

285
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,717
He's so much nicer when
he's not chasing me.

286
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:46,071
- Ha ha! You ready to get outta here?

287
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:46,904
- Let's go.

288
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:47,737
- Let's go.

289
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:48,590
- Guys! He just landed in D.C..

290
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,423
- [Chris] What?

291
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:50,256
- [Karl] Actually?

292
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:51,089
- [Nolan] Yeah.

293
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,260
- That's over two hours away now still.

294
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,880
- Are we finally in Washington, D.C.?

295
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,840
- Holy cow-
- What does it say-

296
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,250
- Wait, Washington the state?

297
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,240
Cuz that would suck.

298
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,730
- And now we're at our
next location; the U-Store.

299
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,960
So like we talked about on the phone,

300
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,793
distract the boys, okay?

301
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:02,626
- Okay.

302
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:05,520
- He's right beside Costa Rica trading.

303
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,140
Whatever that is, it's right beside it.

304
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,940
- I just bought this storage locker

305
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,617
and I'm gonna put this sign
right here with this message:

306
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:14,040
"Time is running out. I was in the box."

307
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,860
If that doesn't make any sense,
just gimme a few seconds.

308
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,140
- Maybe we can approach from the back.

309
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,628
- Hey, I tried that
with your mom one time.

310
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:21,810
(boys laughing)

311
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,520
- Me and you are gonna
hide in these boxes.

312
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,410
We're literally about
to get shipped alive.

313
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,490
- Jimmy, what is this?

314
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,450
What do you have me doing bro?

315
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,379
- Oh, that was probably
the worst drive ever.

316
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,212
- Ahhh!

317
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,610
- Karl. You stay here
and watch the vehicle.

318
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,230
Make sure no one pops our tire again.

319
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,372
- I'll sit right here.

320
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,570
- [The Boys] You're standing.

321
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,220
- I'm wondering if you've
seen this individual.

322
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,297
- Oh yeah, I saw him.

323
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:40,130
- Still around here?

324
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,537
- Yeah. I think he's downstairs.

325
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:42,370
Let me take you there.

326
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,203
- Downstairs!
- Downstairs?

327
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:44,036
- Downstairs?

328
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:45,660
- Should we just be
following random people

329
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,680
to their basement?

330
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,610
Is this okay?

331
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,490
I just don't understand why
all this is necessary, Jimmy.

332
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,690
- Let me get something to cut it.

333
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,890
Can you wait for me here, sir?

334
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,723
- Yeah.

335
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,490
- That truck you see
right here is my getaway.

336
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,157
I'm being transported right now.

337
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,193
Karl was right above us.

338
00:08:01,193 --> 00:08:02,193
- Holy crap.

339
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,027
(blade cutting)

340
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,527
- [The Boys] This is so extra!

341
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,483
Hey, here we go.

342
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:10,500
- [Chris] "Time is
running out. Karl sucks.

343
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,333
I was in the box."

344
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,020
- Hey, hey. Check the tracker right now.

345
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,100
- [Chris] We're gonna have to go upstairs

346
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,270
to get service, to check.

347
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,164
- Are we free to get out?

348
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:17,714
- [Tareq] Um. Hold on. Not yet.

349
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,190
- I got Jimmy right here. He's gone.

350
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,023
He's long gone-

351
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:24,856
- Here's the thing.

352
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,820
There was a box truck when we got here.

353
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,320
He's gone in the box truck!

354
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,550
- [Karl] Guys! Where have you been?

355
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,471
- Come on. We just gotta go.

356
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:32,700
- I can't believe that worked.

357
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,800
Up next, we're going to a private island.

358
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,420
- Jimmy looks like he's crossed a bridge

359
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,680
and now going to a boathouse.

360
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,970
- Oh my goodness.

361
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,460
So we got a plane, a boat, a box truck.

362
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,690
What else is he gonna do?

363
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,130
- Thanks for the trip. Have a good day.

364
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,360
Even though that was really cool.

365
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,190
The box truck moves incredibly slow,

366
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,420
so they could be here any second.

367
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,253
What's up, man?

368
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,086
You ready to take us to the island?

369
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:50,919
Let's do this.

370
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,840
- Jimmy's calling. What's up, Jimmy?

371
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,130
- [Jimmy] Okay. What up, Chris?

372
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,180
Hey, how's it going?

373
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,076
You getting in a boat?

374
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,210
- No, actually I'm not.

375
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,560
- That's a nice pier you're at.

376
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,210
- Wait. Where are you?

377
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,600
- Maybe we might be about to
tackle you in about 10 seconds-

378
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,130
- Maybe I'm under-
- I hung up.

379
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,828
Look now we're turning the tables.

380
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:09,270
He thinks we're right
by him and we're not!

381
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,250
- Wait. I was calling him
to brag about the boxes,

382
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,390
but now I'm confused.

383
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,510
- [Karl] There are so many
boats here. What is going on?

384
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,343
- All right. There he is go, go, go, go.

385
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:17,490
- [Tareq] That's Karl. That's Karl.

386
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,540
- You nerd!

387
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,373
- [Tareq] They're coming!
- [Jimmy] Go, go, go.

388
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:20,206
- [Tareq] They're coming in strong.

389
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:21,570
- I got you some swan boats.

390
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,100
- It's always boats with you.

391
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,990
- Hey, get to pedaling
on your little swan.

392
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,823
- We'll go after him-

393
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:26,656
- Go.
- Go!

394
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:27,489
- We'll get in the next one.

395
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:28,322
- I'm gonna be honest.

396
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:29,400
I never tested those swans.

397
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,110
For all I know, they could be really fast.

398
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,040
- Wow. This is slow.

399
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,990
This is unreasonably slow.

400
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,000
- Did you ever chase
anyone on a swan before?

401
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,833
- This will be a first.

402
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,040
`- I'm gonna act like the boat broke.

403
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,940
Hey, Karl!

404
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,773
- Yes?

405
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:40,980
- My boat isn't working.

406
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,210
So I'd hurry up.

407
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,043
- His boat's broken.

408
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:44,419
Here's our chance. Hurry!

409
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:45,840
(boys grunting)

410
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,240
- This is the most
anti-climatic thing ever.

411
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,073
- [Tareq] Yeah.

412
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:50,970
- You got four hours left
until I keep the hundred grand.

413
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,803
See you later.

414
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:52,740
- You'll pay!

415
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,090
- And now we're at the island.

416
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,230
Hurry up, nerds!

417
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,520
- Come on over, let's talk.

418
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,470
The sun's not even down yet, my friend.

419
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,490
- They just docked.

420
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,323
- [Tareq] Go, go, go, go. They're close!

421
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:01,156
- [Chris] Hey, come on, guys.

422
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:01,989
- [Kurt] You're going right in.

423
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:02,822
You're fine.

424
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:03,799
- What the heck are we doing?

425
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,000
- I think we're lost.
We went the wrong way.

426
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,140
Oh where do we go? Please help us.

427
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,973
Help us. Help us.

428
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:09,000
We asked some people
on the island for help.

429
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,870
Cause to be honest, I'm lost.

430
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,852
- [Tareq] Me too.

431
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,540
- Jimmy, I will end you!

432
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,973
We're stuck. We're lost.

433
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:17,040
(indistinct)

434
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,410
Now we found a path. This has
to be where Jimmy's going.

435
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,580
- I only have three more hours here.

436
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,570
We need to get going here.

437
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,270
He's on the other side of the island.

438
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,560
- We make it outta here
without getting found,

439
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,330
then we're finally going
to the NFL stadium.

440
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,320
Are you subscribed?

441
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,153
- Uh yeah.

442
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:30,180
- [Tareq] Jimmy we don't have time.

443
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,320
- We always have time for this.

444
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,153
- [Tareq] That's fair.

445
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:33,200
- I don't care to fact check
you. Here's some money.

446
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,033
- Uh what?

447
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,760
- Thanks for subscribing. Now
I gotta run to regain my time.

448
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,140
- [Tareq] Yes!

449
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,973
- Guys?

450
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:38,806
What!

451
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,260
Kurt. There's nothing.

452
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,120
- We made it off the island
to our getaway vehicle.

453
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,860
And now it's time for my
favorite part of the video.

454
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,050
We're heading to an NFL
stadium that I rented.

455
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,610
- We should have never got on this island.

456
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,450
- Let's see where he is now.

457
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,440
- [The Boys] Oh, he's still driving?

458
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,730
- He's going towards Capitol Hill.

459
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,670
- I can't believe we rented
an entire NFL stadium.

460
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,260
Look at how huge this place is!

461
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,550
This is gonna be so much fun.

462
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,913
- [Karl] Let's get to our car. Come on.

463
00:10:57,913 --> 00:10:59,370
We have like two hours left.

464
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,597
- I hate to break the bad news to you,

465
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:02,400
but it ain't a spa.

466
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,233
- What is it?

467
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,200
- A football stadium.

468
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,670
- He's at a football stadium?

469
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,930
- That sounds like running...

470
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,210
- I have a pre-recorded
video of me on loop

471
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,537
telling them they'll never find me.

472
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,200
"You'll never find me in this stadium.

473
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,033
Losers."

474
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,330
Isn't that so funny?

475
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,280
And not only do I have
that video playing on loop,

476
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,260
but I've filled the
stadium with mannequins

477
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,280
so they'll think it's me.

478
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,200
They literally only have
two and a half hours left

479
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,100
to get this money.

480
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,330
- Let's go, go, go, go, go.

481
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,640
- Did he just rent an entire stadium?

482
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,410
Unbelievable. Let's see where he is.

483
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,110
So we have, he looks
like he's in the center.

484
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,921
- Wait, Jimmy's on the TV!

485
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:33,754
- [Chris] Aw.

486
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:34,587
- [Kurt] Oh no.

487
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:35,420
- [Chris] Come on.

488
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,780
- All right, I think
that's a little too much.

489
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,490
- Oh, he tortured me for a whole day here.

490
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,323
- Let's go get him.

491
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,156
- Let's go get him.
- Can we go catch him?

492
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:40,989
- Let's go get him.

493
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,990
- [Jimmy] "You'll never
find me in this stadium-

494
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,823
- Holy cow.

495
00:11:43,823 --> 00:11:45,867
- "You'll never find me-
- [Kurt] Oh my Lord.

496
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:49,500
- [Nolan] Look at all the mannequins!

497
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,930
- As you can see, the boys
just walked into the stadium.

498
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,460
They're probably so confused.

499
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,027
Can you cut the audio for me please?

500
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:56,430
"You'll never find me in this stadium."

501
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,263
Wait for it...

502
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,850
Boom. Now the audio's off. It's my time.

503
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,310
- How did this man-
- [Jimmy] Hello, boys.

504
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,143
- Hello?

505
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:03,976
- Hello?

506
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:06,565
- As you can see, there
is over 70,000 seats

507
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:09,180
and unlimited rooms in this stadium.

508
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,490
I need you guys to expect the unexpected.

509
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,587
Cuz, I could literally be anywhere.

510
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:16,260
And don't forget; you literally
only have two hours left

511
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,730
to win this hundred thousand dollars.

512
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,170
Good luck!

513
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,323
- This place is huge!

514
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,156
- What a jerk-

515
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,590
- Oh also, Karl's a nerd.

516
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,366
- [Karl] Stop man! What the heck!

517
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:25,890
(Jimmy laughing)

518
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,850
- Yo, this is so much fun.

519
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,860
- Hey, hey! I saw movement in that window-

520
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,680
- [Chris] He has to be in a box
where he can reach this mic-

521
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,060
- I swear I just saw movement.

522
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,260
- Nolan, what are you pointing at?

523
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,390
- I saw you! I saw movement!

524
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,310
- Wait, where is he pointing?

525
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,053
Turn to your left a little bit.

526
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:40,962
- I see him!

527
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:41,795
Run!

528
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,230
- [Chris] I told you he was in a box.

529
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,107
- And now they're coming
straight towards us.

530
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:45,600
- [Tareq] Why'd you do this?

531
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
- We should probably move.

532
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,340
- [Tareq] We should go.

533
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,173
(Tareq and Jimmy laughing)

534
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,006
- [Chris] He's on the run!

535
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:50,100
- And now we're heading out the back way.

536
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,793
And the cool part is, they
don't know what the back way is.

537
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,680
Good luck, nerds. I believe in you.

538
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,790
- Hey guys, over here!

539
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,635
- He just called the boys!

540
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:58,468
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

541
00:12:58,468 --> 00:12:59,970
- Second level. He is moving around.

542
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,803
- [Nolan] Kurt!

543
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:01,636
- He's going that way.

544
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:02,469
- [Nolan] How do we get up there?

545
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:03,302
- This way! Escalators.

546
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:04,135
- [Jimmy] Let's go up.

547
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,213
- [Tareq] Let's just go up?

548
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,491
- [Nolan] Oh no! They're not working!

549
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:11,158
(intense music)

550
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,193
That's Jimmy!

551
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:18,600
- [Jimmy] It's Nolan!

552
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,310
- Hurry, it's Jimmy!

553
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,350
- Tareq! Sacrifice yourself!

554
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,183
- [Tareq] Sacrifice myself?

555
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:24,016
- Yeah.

556
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:24,849
- [Tareq] He went that way.

557
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:26,040
- [Nolan] No, he didn't, there's a door!

558
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,887
Get out of the way, Tareq!

559
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,960
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

560
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,793
- Here's my strategy.

561
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,150
I'm gonna go fake pose like a mannequin

562
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,830
and pray they don't find me
for the next hour and a half.

563
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,663
Okay?

564
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:39,496
They've seen what I'm wearing.

565
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:40,823
So I'm gonna steal this
mannequins clothes.

566
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,260
Do I look like a mannequin?

567
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,620
- Jimmy, come on out and play.

568
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,630
- I know he's one of the
mannequins over there.

569
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,100
Let's pretend like we don't know that.

570
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,170
These stupid mannequins, man.

571
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,820
Where is this nerd?

572
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,103
- [Chris] If I was Jimmy,
where would I hide?

573
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:58,122
- [Nolan] Kurt? Kurt.

574
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,203
- [Tareq] Jimmy, go, go, go, go.

575
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,490
- [The Boys] Yes! Let's go!

576
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,380
- Honestly, I've been
running for like 14 hours.

577
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,373
When he was right there, I was like,

578
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:13,140
I don't feel like getting tackled.

579
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,010
He can just have the money.

580
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,540
What are you gonna spend
the hundred grand on?

581
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,684
- I'm gonna spend it on my wife.

582
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:17,517
- Really?

583
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:19,440
- I'm gonna make sure that
my family is enjoys it.

584
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,273
- Aw-

585
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:21,106
- that's the important thing-

586
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:21,939
- That's really sweet.

587
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,213
- One of the best
experiences I've ever had.

588
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,950
- In our last video, I mentioned
that every single person

589
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,780
that buys this executive
producer shirt or hoodie

590
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,370
will get their name at
the end of this video,

591
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,530
which is why you see names on
the left side of your screen.

592
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,000
Because that is every single person

593
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,380
that purchased this shirt or hoodie.

594
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,820
And I didn't tell you
guys I would do this,

595
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,653
but on top of that,

596
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:38,820
we also wrote every
single one of your names

597
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,020
on the wall of my studio.

598
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,910
Literally every day,
when I come in to film,

599
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,440
I'm gonna see your name on this wall.

600
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,290
Like Peter Wild, when I film,
I'm gonna be reminded of you.

601
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,940
And same with Knox and
Knox Tucker and Koda

602
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:51,277
and Koda G and all these Michaels.

603
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:53,250
And on top of that,
Chandler, bring it on in.

604
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,451
I also got all your
names put on this Tesla.

605
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:59,820
That's right. Not only are all
your names on my studio wall,

606
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,740
but your names are also on this Tesla.

607
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,850
And this is the fun part.

608
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,430
Chandler, I want you to pick
a random name on this Tesla

609
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,560
and we're gonna give it to
them in like 30 seconds.

610
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,460
All right, let's do it.

611
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,020
Matt Liggett.

612
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,853
- [Jimmy] What about him?

613
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:12,150
- [Chandler] He didn't win.

614
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,983
- [Jimmy] Oh, he didn't win?

615
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:14,220
Well, tell me when you have the winner.

616
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,770
- Hey Jimmy, you have
Peyton Chicken Nugget

617
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,000
as one of your fans.

618
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,130
- Can you investigate that?
See if that's their real name.

619
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,390
- I'm thinking probably not.

620
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,010
- Derpyfish, 89.

621
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,630
I told you to use your real name,

622
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,567
but I didn't actually fact check it.

623
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,210
You go in the S category.

624
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,830
There's a bunch of Sponge Bobs.

625
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,210
And I know your names aren't SpongeBob.

626
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,050
- Jimmy!

627
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,883
- Yeah?

628
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:33,000
- Tell me when to stop.

629
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,210
- Uh, wait for it, now stop.

630
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,320
- Oh. Which finger?

631
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,370
- I'm a pinky kinda guy.

632
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,350
- Alexander Hedge, this Tesla...

633
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,183
- [The Boys] Yeah! All right-

634
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,390
- I don't know if that made any sense.

635
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,496
Congratulations, Alexander.
You just won a brand new Tesla.

636
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:46,970
Sorry that it's covered in names.

637
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,180
If you want, you can remove 'em.

638
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,140
Thank you so much.
