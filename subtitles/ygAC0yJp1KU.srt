00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,195
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:04,620
This is one of the most searched
questions on the internet.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,560
How to lose weight?

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,000
And this is probably the most popular 
New Year's resolution in the world.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,417
Weight loss.

6
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:16,952
On this one question, 
millions of YouTube videos have been made,

7
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:19,200
thousands of articles have been written,

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,440
and so many rumours have been spread.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,000
Some tell you to eat Maggi for a muscular body,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,846
some tell you to go on a low-carb diet,

11
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:26,468
some tell you to go on a low-fat diet,

12
00:00:26,468 --> 00:00:28,375
some try to sell their fake products.

13
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:32,229
A entire industry has been built on 
weight loss.

14
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,455
In today's video, let's understand this concept
in a scientific way.

15
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,530
What's true and what's myth?

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,455
To lose weight, what should you eat and 
what should you not eat?

17
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:43,749
And which diet is the best?

18
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:44,716
Let's find out.

19
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:46,121
"The Wonder 10-day diet!"

20
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:47,926
"Burn away fat, while you sleep!"

21
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:50,342
"A diet that can work when nothing else will."

22
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,345
"The popular Paleo diet."

23
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:53,966
"Ketogenic or Keto."

24
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,897
"Brand new South East diet."

25
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:57,054
"Promising new weight loss drug."

26
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,092
"Another groundbreaking weight loss drug.

27
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,219
could soon be available in pill form."

28
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:04,360
The logic behind weight loss is quite simple.

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,309
Imagine that you have a bank account.

30
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:10,539
All the money you earn gets accumulated in
your bank account.

31
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:13,442
All the money you spend 
is deducted from your bank account.

32
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:15,720
So if you want to increase your bank balance,

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,000
you either have to increase your earnings

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,869
or reduce your expenses.

35
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:22,923
Similarly, our body has a calorie bank.

36
00:01:22,923 --> 00:01:26,007
The calories you consume, accumulate here.

37
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:29,369
And the more you spend, 
it is deducted from the stored calories.

38
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,640
This calorie bank is our body.

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,238
To store calories, they are converted into
fat and stored by the body,

40
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:38,042
which increases our weight.

41
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:39,534
So if you want to lose weight,

42
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:41,884
either reduce your calorie intake or

43
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,562
spend more calories.

44
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,924
To spend calories is known as Burning Calories.

45
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:50,218
Let's talk about how calories burn later,

46
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:51,453
before that, let's know

47
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:53,346
where do calories come from?

48
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,162
The food you eat,

49
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,542
whatever you drink, except water,

50
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:59,624
all of them have energy

51
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:00,573
in the form of calories.

52
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:05,179
In nutritional science, the definition of
calories is that "it is a unit of energy."

53
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:09,863
So, the food and water you are consuming,
that is where the calories are coming from.

54
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,433
Since calories are a form of energy,

55
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,899
everything for which the body uses energy,

56
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:16,870
calories are burned for those.

57
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,501
The most obvious thing that comes to people's
mind to burn calories is exercising.

58
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,580
This is true,

59
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,395
our body needs energy is needed for every process,

60
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,277
so calories are burned for everything.

61
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,050
To make your heart beat,

62
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,636
for your lungs to breathe,

63
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:32,853
to digest food in your stomach,

64
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,430
energy is needed for all.

65
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,985
For this reason, even while sleeping at night,
your calories are burned.

66
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:39,866
You heard it right.

67
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:45,289
On average, a normal person burns 400 calories
during 8 hours of sleep.

68
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:49,235
And these calories are burned
merely to keep the body alive,

69
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,750
this is known as 
Basal Metabolic Rate or BMR.

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,266
Every person has a different 
Basal Metabolic Rate.

71
00:02:55,266 --> 00:03:00,660
It depends on your height, weight, muscle
mass and many other factors.

72
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,651
There is an online calculator through which
you can calculate your BMR.

73
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,265
The link is in the description below.

74
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:09,511
For example, I am 28 years old

75
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:11,121
and my height is 186 cm

76
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:12,443
and weight is 80 kg.

77
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:16,762
So my BMR is 1828 calories per day.

78
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:20,347
So I will burn this many calories every day
without doing anything.

79
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,961
Now, apart from this, I told you that eating

80
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,401
provides calories to the body.

81
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:30,563
But do you know, depending on what food
you are eating, your food can burn calories too?

82
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:35,448
Here comes the concept of the 
Thermic Effect of Food, in short TEF.

83
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,011
The logic is very simple,

84
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,988
when you eat food,
your body has to digest the food,

85
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,253
absorb nutrients from the food

86
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:45,124
and store the food.

87
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:49,603
In all these processes, the body uses 
energy and burns calories.

88
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:52,037
So some things have a low thermal effect.

89
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:55,959
Like fats, oil, flour, and butter.

90
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,525
Our body digests these things very easily.

91
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:01,074
There is almost no need to burn any calories.

92
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,941
On the other hand, whole grains or protein
rich foods,

93
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:08,621
Dairy, eggs, high-fibre vegetables and fruits,

94
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,428
spinach, broccoli, 
these have a high Thermic Effect.

95
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:17,255
Our body has to burn a lot of calories to
digest these foods.

96
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:21,358
That is why it becomes difficult to gain weight
by eating this type of food.

97
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,673
Now you will wonder, if this means that

98
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:26,966
some types of food may provide negative calories.

99
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:33,226
The calories available in that food, the body
is burning more calories to consume that food.

100
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:34,725
This is a myth, friends.

101
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:39,866
To achieve this, the thermic effect of any
food should be more than 100%,

102
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,055
which is impossible.

103
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:42,063
This can't happen.

104
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:45,996
The highest thermic effect possible is around 30%,

105
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,872
usually found in proteins.

106
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:51,138
This means that if you are eating 100 calories of protein,

107
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:54,893
you are spending 30 calories to digest that protein

108
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:59,467
and your body is actually
gaining only 70 calories.

109
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,659
Now, there is no need to go into the math too much.

110
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:05,024
I am not asking you to find out the
thermic effect of every food before eating.

111
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:07,135
I just wanted to give you a basic idea

112
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:10,269
so that you know that this kind of concept exists.

113
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,006
Now, let's talk about weight loss.

114
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:13,697
After listening to what I said till now,

115
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:15,548
people might wonder why should we exercise at all.

116
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,134
If you consume fewer calories than your 
body's basal metabolic rate,

117
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,910
you will lose weight automatically.

118
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,787
Theoretically, this is true, but practically,
it is very dangerous.

119
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:27,518
Eating fewer calories than your BMR 
without exercising means that

120
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:29,913
your body's hormonal balance can deteriorate.

121
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,606
You will be more tired.

122
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:33,082
You will become more irritable.

123
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,978
It will be very difficult for you to focus
on your studies and work.

124
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:40,191
Do you know which body part consumes
the most calories in the human body?

125
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,191
Our brain.

126
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:45,957
Almost 20% of the energy usage of the 
human body is consumed by the brain.

127
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:48,588
It becomes difficult to self-control for the body.

128
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:50,154
Many people have this problem

129
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:51,705
where once they start eating less,

130
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:52,787
they become weak,

131
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,860
their mood is disrupted terribly,

132
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,382
they will go on a diet for some time,

133
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,758
but after that, they will start binging

134
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,353
and their diet will fail.

135
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:04,148
That's why our goal should not be weight loss,

136
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:05,846
but healthy weight loss.

137
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:08,941
And for healthy weight loss, exercise is very
important.

138
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,530
In fact, four main things are very important.

139
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,105
Diet control, exercise, proper sleep, and
keeping yourself stress-free.

140
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,974
The last two points are quite obvious,

141
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:20,579
but if you struggle with them,

142
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,966
keeping yourself stress-free

143
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,015
and getting 8 hours of sleep daily,

144
00:06:25,015 --> 00:06:28,622
then it means that you are not
managing your time properly.

145
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:32,276
And in such a situation, you need the right
time management in your life.

146
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:38,069
I made this course on time management and
productivity to teach you this.

147
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,087
The special thing is that I focus a lot on
happiness in this course.

148
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:44,646
Waking up at 5 am every day 
and working for 12 hours a day,

149
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:47,693
I am strongly against this
type of hustle culture advice.

150
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:49,778
That's why my time management course will

151
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:53,972
not only increase your productivity but also
your overall life satisfaction.

152
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:59,088
I use the step-by-step techniques that 
I teach you in this course in my life,

153
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:00,308
with the help of which

154
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:04,700
I can regularly bring you these videos
while travelling the world.

155
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,046
Those who have taken the course so far, have
found it very life-changing.

156
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:10,434
You can see their reviews on the screen.

165
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:36,159
While joining, just remember one thing, the
the entire course is in the English language.

166
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,679
Now, let's come back to the topic

167
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:41,005
and understand diet control in detail.

168
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:44,858
Have you ever had a feeling that even 
though you have eaten a whole chocolate bar

169
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:46,266
but still you are feeling hungry?

170
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,030
After eating certain things,
you still don't feel full.

171
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,518
The reason behind this is the Satiety Index.

172
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:55,446
The thing is that there are some types of food

173
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:58,303
after eating which you feel full

174
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,060
and some types of food aren't like that.

175
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,545
In 1995, some researchers 

176
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:07,062
tested 240-calorie servings of 38 types of food.

177
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:11,478
They found that boiled potatoes had the highest
satiety index among all potato dishes.

178
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:14,112
Potatoes were given a score of 323.

179
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:15,770
There are some other things like pulses,

180
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,651
high-fibre foods, low-fat dairy products, eggs, and nuts.

181
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:22,046
These things also have a very high index.

182
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,833
This means that for the same amount of calories,

183
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,378
if you eat high-satiety food items,

184
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:29,259
you will comparatively feel more full.

185
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,015
You will feel less hungry, even though the
number of calories is the same.

186
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:34,721
Now, some people will say that

187
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:38,658
they would eat boiled potatoes throughout 
the day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

188
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:41,256
So they consume the least amount of calories in the day

189
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:43,169
while feeling full,

190
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,750
They'll go on a potato-only diet.

191
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,301
But again, this is a wrong approach.

192
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:49,830
It is alright to tweak a few things here and there,

193
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,761
but overall, the body needs a nutritious diet.

194
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:55,308
Your goal here is healthy weight loss.

195
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:57,763
Meaning, you don't want to lose muscle,

196
00:08:57,763 --> 00:08:59,593
you don't want to lose your health,

197
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:01,176
you just want to lose weight.

198
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,626
There are 6 different essential nutrients

199
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,177
that the body needs for optimal function.

200
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:11,103
Proteins, carbohydrates, fats, 
vitamins, minerals, and water.

201
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:13,087
So when you are on a healthy weight loss diet,

202
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:17,026
you will definitely need proteins, vitamins,
minerals, and water.

203
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:20,131
Now the question is about 
fats and carbohydrates.

204
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:20,898
What about them?

205
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:24,222
Many people suggest different types 
of low-fat, low-carb diets.

206
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:26,284
So let's talk about carbohydrates first.

207
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:31,441
Carbohydrates, in short carbs, what is their
relation with weight loss?

208
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,565
The sugar that comes out of carbs is an important
source of energy for the body.

209
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,335
If our body does not use
that energy immediately,

210
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:42,891
the energy from the carbs is converted 
into glycogen and stored

211
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:44,973
in the liver and muscles.

212
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:48,922
If a person eats more carbs than his body needs,

213
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:55,045
the body converts those carbs into
fat cells and stores it as fat.

214
00:09:55,045 --> 00:10:00,052
If this energy is not used later, it remains
in the form of fat cells

215
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,791
and you gain weight.

216
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,956
You might think that carbohydrates should be avoided

217
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,439
but this is the wrong conclusion.

218
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:13,218
I apologize in advance for disappointing 
the fans of keto or low-carb diet.

219
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:19,585
In 2017, a meta-analysis was done 
of 32 controlled feeding studies.

220
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,538
Keeping the level of protein and calories the same,

221
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,036
they found out whether high-carb
diet is better or a low-carb diet.

222
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:30,261
This research found that there is no benefit in weight loss

223
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:33,056
whether you follow a high-carb
or a low-carb diet.

224
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:37,217
Weight loss, ultimately, works only due to Calorie Deficit.

225
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:40,661
The same calorie bank balance that 
I explained in the beginning.

226
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:44,069
In 2012, another study was conducted in a Swedish University

227
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:48,068
to compare whether a low-fat diet is better
or a low-carb diet.

228
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:52,872
This study monitored people for 2 years and
ended with the same conclusion.

229
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:55,608
Weight loss has nothing to do with these things.

230
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:58,583
Only calories are important here.

231
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:02,545
Now, some people go on a high-protein diet
to lose weight.

232
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,786
Because some people have a perception that

233
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:09,751
if they eat fats or carbs, they will convert
into fat cells leading to weight gain.

234
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,768
But if they eat protein only, their muscles will grow bigger.

235
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:18,459
It is true that protein is usually used for
muscle building and muscle repairing.

236
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,406
So if you do weight training, 
exercise more, wrestle or such,

237
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:24,783
then naturally you will need more protein.

238
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:29,680
But if you sit on the sofa all day, 
don't move, don't exercise,

239
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,145
then the excess protein
you are eating also converts into fat.

240
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:36,284
Now some people will say 
after watching this video that

241
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:39,417
they went on a low-carb diet and lost weight,

242
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,829
thinking that it works for them.

243
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:42,216
But here I would like to say that

244
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:46,253
if your body is suddenly deprived of carbs,

245
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:49,613
then your body loses water weight.

246
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:54,256
Glycogen stores help in retaining water in
our body.

247
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:59,965
So if you go on a keto diet for a week, you
will lose 1-2 kgs of weight for sure.

248
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:03,268
And that will be because your body has lost
its water weight.

249
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:07,010
As soon as you start eating carbs again, that
water weight will come back.

250
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,067
Dr Sara Seidelmann and her team of researchers

251
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:13,703
did a study on 15,400 people for 6 years.

252
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:16,843
It was published in the famous Lancet Public
Health Journal.

253
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:20,803
And it studied people who are on a low-carb diet

254
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:22,850
but are eating more animal protein.

255
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,349
This study found that this diet can actually
reduce the lifespan.

256
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:31,542
When a low-carb diet is replaced by plant protein and fat,

257
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,384
then it will be beneficial.

258
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:36,396
I have talked about this in the video of World's Oldest Human

259
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:40,261
what are the things that can be done to extend our lifespan.

260
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:43,939
Now, if we have to go low-carb, 
then how low should we go?

261
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:48,951
This study found that if less than 40% of
total energy is coming from carbs

262
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,899
or more than 70% of total energy comes from carbs.

263
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,671
Both pose a higher risk to our health.

264
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:58,913
It means that what we were taught in school

265
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,247
is very important here.

266
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,983
A balanced diet.

267
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:07,969
While doing a healthy weight loss, you don't
need to completely remove carbs from your diet.

268
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:10,232
Rather, you need to eat healthy carbs.

269
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:12,823
" Carbohydrates is the food for the brain.

270
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:15,381
If you stop eating carbs,
your brain health may start declining. 

271
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:19,200
Aggression, depression, nervousness, anxiety,
trepidation, all these are part of it."

272
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,527
What are healthy carbs?

273
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:23,229
Carbs that are absorbed by the body slowly.

274
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:26,165
These don't raise or lower the blood sugar level.

275
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:29,019
And give the body a steady source of energy.

276
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:33,179
Examples of these are whole grains, fruits,
and starchy vegetables.

277
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,552
And now, let's talk about fats.

278
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,812
When you hear the word fat,
you might think that they make you fat.

279
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:43,110
But this fat nutrient
is also an essential nutrient

280
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,883
and the body needs it too.

281
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:50,338
Many vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin
E, vitamin K are fat-soluble vitamins,

282
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:53,576
so the body needs fats to absorb them.

283
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:56,397
Apart from this, fats are needed for hormonal balance,

284
00:13:56,397 --> 00:14:00,047
energy storage and to protect our vital organs.

285
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,521
Human brains are made up of 60% fat.

286
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:07,124
And this advice was given by the popular nutritionist
Pooja Makhija.

287
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:11,139
This trend of eating a low-fat diet, 
she was against it.

288
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,705
She said that fats don't make you fat.

289
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:18,351
Rather, eating more fat and eating the wrong
kind of fat makes you fat.

290
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:22,293
So, a healthy weight loss diet is a balanced diet

291
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:25,894
in which carbohydrates, proteins and
fats are present.

292
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:29,172
The next question is, what is the 
optimum percentage of each of them?

293
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:31,812
What is the healthy proportion?

294
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:38,444
There is a range called Acceptable Macronutrient
Distribution Ranges (AMDR).

295
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:43,023
According to this, 45-65% of your daily calories

296
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:44,366
should be from carbohydrates.

297
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:48,271
20-35% of calories should be from fats.

298
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:51,534
10-35% of calories should be from protein.

299
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:55,268
The percentage you should be in this range

300
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:58,168
depends on your personal lifestyle choices.

301
00:14:58,168 --> 00:14:59,545
Your age,

302
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,495
how much muscle you want to gain,

303
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:04,268
are you diabetic, what kind of food you prefer.

304
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:08,439
For these you can consult a professional dietician,

305
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:12,159
and it will be a good idea, 
to get a diet plan customized for you.

306
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,538
If you do not want to consult a dietitian,

307
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,796
then for an average person who is 
not facing any health problems,

308
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:21,348
it would be better to stay within this range.

309
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:25,625
So, the next question you will ask is, how
can you stay within this range?

310
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,662
What to eat and what not to eat?

311
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:30,718
Let's clear this point by point.

312
00:15:30,718 --> 00:15:32,212
What should you eat?

313
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:33,881
You should eat whole grains.

314
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:35,297
Complex Carbohydrates.

315
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:36,978
Other than wheat and rice,

316
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,173
you should eat different types of grains like

317
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:42,808
corn, oats, barley, ragi, buckwheat (kuttu),

318
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,209
amaranth, which is also called chaulai,

319
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,061
or pearl millet (bajra).

320
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:48,372
Eat them as flatbreads (roti) or porridge.

321
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:51,781
Apart from this, you should eat legumes like
grams (chana)

322
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:54,701
or different types of lentils.

323
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:57,983
These are good sources of complex carbohydrates.

324
00:15:57,983 --> 00:15:59,962
And they also have fiber and protein.

325
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:03,792
Then you focus on other healthy foods like
fruits and vegetables.

326
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:05,581
Kidney beans (rajma), chickpeas (chole), 
soy protein (soya chunks),

327
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:08,106
gram powdered (sattu), fruits, berries,

328
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:10,477
dry fruits, peanuts, walnuts,

329
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:11,817
pumpkin seeds, chia seeds,

330
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:14,582
flax seeds, spices, eggs.

331
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:17,821
Dairy items like milk, curd, and cottage cheese (paneer)

332
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:19,021
contain healthy fats.

333
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,138
They should be eaten in controlled amounts.

334
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:26,388
It is important to mention that many people
think that they are eating a balanced diet.

335
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:28,953
But in reality, their diet is not balanced.

336
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:31,701
In North India, you must have seen many people

337
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:34,712
eating 3-4 rotis with half a bowl of vegetables.

338
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:36,128
This is not the right proportion.

339
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,448
Unknowingly, in their home-cooked meals, many people

340
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:42,907
eat more rotis in a higher proportion of carbs.

341
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:45,175
They should increase the amount of vegetables.

342
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,220
"Other than water, what else should one eat?

343
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,990
Drink water, eat green vegetables, 

344
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,554
green is very good for the body.

345
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:54,062
It contains antioxidants, 
it is good for the skin.

346
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:55,330
I eat a lot of vegetables." 

347
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,199
Don't be stingy in buying vegetables.

348
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,999
And second, don't bargain with the vegetable vendor.

349
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,774
Even if you save ₹5-₹10 by paying less to a poor person,

350
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:04,993
you won't be able to build a palace.

351
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,704
If you want to save money,

352
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:08,688
don't spend ₹150 on burgers,

353
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,165
don't spend ₹400 on pizza.

354
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:12,895
The online food delivery apps that you use,

355
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,238
on which you spend thousands every month,

356
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:16,340
save money there.

357
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,007
I would say, stop relying on food delivery apps.

358
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:25,682
Use that money to buy nuts, seeds, fruits,
and other healthy food.

359
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:30,077
If you don't want to cook food, hire someone.

360
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:34,597
Someone will get employment and you
will be able to eat healthy and tasty food.

361
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:38,924
Now let's talk about what you should not eat
in a healthy weight loss diet.

362
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,492
First of all, refined flour.

363
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,357
Refined carbohydrates like refined flour
get digested very quickly in your body.

364
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,153
You can see unhealthy spikes in your blood
sugar levels because of this.

365
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,435
And if you eat many things made of refined flour

366
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:55,396
then after 1-2 hours of eating 
you will start feeling hungry again.

367
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:59,587
Because shortly after eating these, 
your blood sugar levels drop rapidly.

368
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:01,434
The second problem with refined flour is that

369
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,599
it has bad cholesterol, 
known as LDL cholesterol,

370
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,512
which causes arteries to clog, increase in blood pressure,

371
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:11,881
increases hunger, increases craving for sweets.

372
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,979
Second, stop eating sugar.

373
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:16,240
This is the same problem with refined sugar,

374
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,880
which is also called added sugar.

375
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,975
I explained this in the video on cold drinks.

376
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:24,990
This added sugar is not only found in cold
drinks, but also in ice creams, candies, biscuits, etc.

377
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,641
Third, stop eating bad fats.

378
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:28,944
As I told you earlier,

379
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:30,831
there are two types of fats.

380
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:32,154
Good fats and bad fats.

381
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:36,530
Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats 
are beneficial for us.

382
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,608
We get these good fats from plant sources.

383
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:42,992
Like peanuts, olive oil,
pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds,

384
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:46,942
almonds, pistachios,
walnuts, sunflower oil, flaxseed oil.

385
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:50,591
On the other hand, we need very little saturated fats.

386
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:53,755
But most people eat a lot of saturated fats.

387
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:58,463
They are found in butter, raw coconut oil
or clarified butter (desi ghee).

388
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:04,265
If you eat a lot of saturated fats for many
years, it increases the risk of heart attack.

389
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:08,548
Palm oil also has saturated fats, which is
found in most packaged foods in India.

390
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:12,836
And then comes trans fats, 
which are the most harmful.

391
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:17,565
These trans fats are found in refined oil,
which is usually in everything that you eat out.

392
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:21,827
Fried food, fried chicken, 
fried momos, fried doughnuts, french fries,

393
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:26,688
Indian street food, golgappas, samosas, 
all of these have high value of trans fats

394
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:28,113
because they are deep fried.

395
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:31,202
Deep-fried foods should be avoided.

396
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:34,740
Some people watch this and say 
that I am fear-mongering.

397
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,575
There's a channel called Foodpharmer,

398
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,825
they make good health-related videos.

399
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:44,116
But people accuse him of fear-mongering
since he points out things that one shouldn't eat.

400
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:48,180
Fear-mongering means spreading fear about
something unnecessary.

401
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,931
But the thing here is that these things 
are they are, actually, very dangerous.

402
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:56,784
Avoid eating as much packaged food as possible.

403
00:19:56,784 --> 00:19:59,847
These are ultra-processed food items made in factories.

404
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:01,512
They are made of everything that's harmful to us.

405
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:05,144
Refined flour, added sugar, 
artificial sweeteners, palm oil,

406
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:08,215
artificial food colours, harmful preservatives.

407
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:12,016
First, let's look at the things made of refined flour.

408
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:14,750
Biscuits, Rusk, Mathri, Chakli,

409
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,024
Namakpare, Fanpuffs, Samosa, Kachodi, 

410
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:20,262
Pav Bhaji, Vada Pav, Aloo Patty,

411
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,952
Hot Dog, Bhature, Kulcha,

412
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:24,307
Tandoori Roti, Naan, Malabar Paratha,

413
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,887
Pizza, Donuts, Chowmein,

414
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,632
Spring Rolls, Momos, Jalebi,

415
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:29,640
Ghevar, Gulab Jamun, Pancakes,

416
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,583
Muffins, Cakes, Sandwiches, Phew!

417
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:35,641
In fact, even your favourite Tandoori Masala
Chhaap has 40% refined flour.

418
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:38,215
And what are the other harmful things 
in these food items?

419
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,243
Bad oil, the deep-fried things,

420
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:42,938
like Bhature, Samosas, Kachori, Momos,

421
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:44,573
the examples I just listed out,

422
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:48,466
Added sugar, apart from this, cold drinks,
ice cream, candies, chocolates, biscuits,

423
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:51,848
cereals, packaged juice, and even the expensive biscuits

424
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:55,354
which are sold as high-fiber, multigrain digestive

425
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,641
contain refined flour, sugar, palm oil,

426
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:01,012
raising agents, artificial flavouring substances.

427
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:04,952
Most people consume these on a daily basis.

428
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:07,016
I would like to give you a 30-day challenge

429
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,133
stop eating these which contain these 4 things.

430
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,934
Maida, added sugar, bad oil or trans fats, and packaged food.

431
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:17,266
Don't eat these things for 30 days

432
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:19,104
and you'll see a transformation in yourself.

433
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:21,472
After these 30 days, you'll feel

434
00:21:21,472 --> 00:21:22,799
much more healthy.

435
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,914
You'll have more energy.

436
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:27,582
You'll be able to concentrate more on work and studies.

437
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:29,680
You might be thinking 
that I haven't left out any ingredients.

438
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,835
What can one eat if not these things?

439
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:33,908
Don't be disheartened. 

440
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:36,592
Because there're so many things to eat other than these.

441
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:39,546
You can eat roti-sabzi with very little ghee or butter.

442
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:42,176
Idli, Upma, Poha, Dhokla,

443
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:45,052
Omelette, Moong Dal Cheela, Dosa,

444
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:47,427
Uttapam, which is made with very little butter,

445
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:48,616
Milk, Curd, Lassi,

446
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:51,541
Boiled Eggs, Natural Fruit Juice, Cheekushake,

447
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,876
Anjeershake, Misi Roti, Tawa Paratha,

448
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:56,298
Raita, Butter Milk, Jeera Rice, Biryani,

449
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:59,163
Hara Bhara Kebab, Mushroom Tikka, Paneer Tikka,

450
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,290
You can eat these if they are made in desi ghee, butter, or olive oil.

451
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,472
The interesting thing is that when you 
start eating more of these things

452
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:08,555
and less of the unhealthy things,

453
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,800
you will notice a transformation,

454
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,481
your taste buds will start changing.

455
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:15,344
You will stop craving for that unhealthy food.

456
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:16,577
This happens a lot to me.

457
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:19,305
I never feel like eating packaged food.

458
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:23,253
You will crave fresh fruits and fresh vegetables.

459
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:25,542
If you are not used to eating all this fresh food,

460
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:28,933
you can start with your favourite fruit or vegetables.

461
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:32,870
Also, learn to control your portions while eating.

462
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,703
Always drink a glass of water before eating

463
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:37,207
so that you don't need to eat much.

464
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:39,871
Eat on small plates, with small spoons,

465
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,336
and eat slowly.

466
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:43,476
Don't eat so much that your stomach is 100% full.

467
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:45,320
Eat till it is 80% full.

468
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,055
I had talked about this in the 
video on the World's Oldest Human.

469
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:50,687
How, in Japan, people have a philosophy of

470
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:52,408
eating only till they are 80% full.

471
00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:54,359
When you eat more vegetables,

472
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:56,529
which have more fibre and more volume,

473
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,237
you'll feel less hungry, 
you'll have less space in your stomach,

474
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:01,254
and you'll consume fewer calories.

475
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,579
Now, this was all about food.

476
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:06,491
Apart from this, the most important thing is exercise.

477
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,499
There are three different types of exercises.

478
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:11,009
First, stamina or cardio exercises,

479
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:13,773
which are important for your cardiovascular fitness.

480
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:17,355
Like swimming, running, or playing any other sport.

481
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:20,482
The exercises that increase your heart rate.

482
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,449
Second, stretching exercises,

483
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:24,390
they are very important for your flexibility.

484
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,790
These include exercises like Surya Namaskar and Yoga.

485
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,640
And third, strength training,

486
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,481
which is important for your muscle strength and muscle endurance.

487
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:34,267
These include lifting heavy weights,

488
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:38,434
going to the gym, doing push-ups, 
squats, planks, or lifting dumbbells.

489
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:43,504
So ideally, all these 3 types of exercises 
should be balanced in a healthy lifestyle.

490
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:47,718
But for weight loss, it doesn't matter 
what type of exercises you do

491
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:51,892
as long as these exercises are helping to burn calories.

492
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:55,670
Some exercises obviously burn more calories than others.

493
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,608
Like running, rope skipping, playing 
badminton, football, and squash.

494
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:02,708
Some exercises burn fewer calories.

495
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,260
like playing cricket, doing yoga or stretching.

496
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,179
So, broadly speaking, you have to keep in mind that

497
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,325
you should burn more calories 
if you want to lose more weight.

498
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,723
But you should do the exercises in the form you like.

499
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:18,450
Whether you do Zumba for 30 minutes

500
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,066
or run for 30 minutes, it's up to you.

501
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:24,634
Apart from this, movement should be 
included in your day-to-day life,

502
00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:27,528
like walking or cycling as much as possible.

503
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:30,775
The extra calories that are burned by these activities,

504
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:32,790
adds up throughout the day.

505
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,618
Always remember, doing something 
is much better than doing nothing.

506
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:40,856
Some people search for 
"best exercises" to lose belly fat.

507
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:44,009
Or the "best exercises" to lose facial fat.

508
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,465
Friends, these are only myths.

509
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:49,891
To some extent, particular muscles can be toned,

510
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:53,805
but spot reduction is more or less not possible.

511
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:56,529
Most of the research and studies that have been done,

512
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,538
do not support this.

513
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,988
The areas where our body stores fat

514
00:24:59,988 --> 00:25:03,763
and the areas where the fat is burned by burning calories,

515
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:05,146
depends entirely on the body.

516
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:07,485
Your job is to exercise,

517
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:10,053
your body will decide for itself 
from where the fat should be burned.

518
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:13,076
When you do this consistently,

519
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:15,725
then overall, one day your body 
will get into a good shape.

520
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:18,500
This depends on genetics

521
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,325
the areas where your body will lose fat.

522
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:23,984
I would like to mention a final point here,
 stress.

523
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:27,133
There is a significant link between weight gain and stress.

524
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:29,288
When you feel stressed,

525
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:32,180
your body's cortisol levels increase.

526
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,572
This reduces your metabolism

527
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:37,764
and increases your craving for fat and sugar.

528
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:39,569
So if you want to lose weight,

529
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:41,803
it is important to manage stress as well.

530
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:44,614
For this, you can do meditation, play sports,

531
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:48,455
or spend time with friends and family in real life.

532
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:50,431
I have told you a lot of things in this video,

533
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:55,348
but I have summarized all the useful 
information on weight loss for you.

534
00:25:55,348 --> 00:25:56,979
Let's do a small rewind

535
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:58,462
so that you remember everything.

536
00:25:58,462 --> 00:26:01,581
The simple principle behind weight loss 
is Calorie Deficit.

537
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:04,258
Control the calories you are eating

538
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:06,426
and increase the calories you are burning.

539
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:10,667
The calories you are eating should come 
from your nutritious, balanced diet.

540
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:14,288
Eat more whole grains, fibrous fruits, 
vegetables, and proteins

541
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:16,988
so that your stomach feels fuller.

542
00:26:16,988 --> 00:26:18,562
So that you feel less hungry.

543
00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:22,854
Avoid eating refined flour, white sugar,
 bad oils and packaged food

544
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:25,231
so that your food cravings can be reduced

545
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:27,620
and you can focus on healthy nutrients.

546
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,668
Move your body daily in some way or the other

547
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:33,713
and include exercises in your regular routine.

548
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:36,481
Cardio exercises, strength training, and stretching exercises.

549
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,328
Make sure to sleep for 7-9 hours daily

550
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:42,886
and keep stress away from your life.

551
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:45,999
And also remember that spot reduction doesn't work

552
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:47,834
and being healthy

553
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,916
doesn't mean you have to fit some beauty standard.

554
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:54,354
These things make a perfect plan 
for healthy weight loss.

555
00:26:54,354 --> 00:26:55,958
If you want to follow this plan,

556
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,946
then write your goal in the comments below.

557
00:26:58,946 --> 00:27:02,305
And after a month, 
after completing this 30-day challenge,

558
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:03,743
give us an update in the comments

559
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:06,000
how the transformation was for you.

560
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,824
To manage your time in life,

561
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:11,265

then you will definitely like this one.

564
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:16,294
In this, I have talked about Blue Zones.

565
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:19,789
The zones all over the world 
where people live the longest.

566
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:21,628
What is the secret behind their health?

567
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:22,845
It's all in the video.

568
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:23,940
Thank you very much!
