1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,396
"How much money did you pay there?"
“I gave 50,000 rupees, Sir ” “50,000 rupees!” "Yes Sir"

2
00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:09,992
"Rahul Manan is only concerned about his money, okay, 
I have understood this after purchasing his course" 

3
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:16,083
"What happened, I watched the entire course till the end, and everything is implemented from A to Z, still failed"

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:20,335
"When I went to watch his course, the comment section there was also filled with abuses"

5
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:26,965
There was no place left, Weather it's YouTube, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Comments

6
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:30,736
Where people are not feeling cheated by buying this course

7
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:33,629
That we paid this money 
and there is no value in that course

8
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:37,112
Earlier too, there have been complaints 
about these fake gurus

9
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:39,464
That they sell courses in the name of money making.

10
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:44,267
Amit Parekh, Rahul Manan, Dev Gadhvi and now Vivek Bindra

11
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:51,235
Where Sandeep Maheshwari ji's video, people complained that they were sold a course and there was no value in it

12
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:55,364
The amazing thing is that, 
this is spread across the world

13
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:58,023
But in India, it is the highest

14
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:05,651
You know, the net worth of e-learning and online courses was 190 billion dollars in 2018

15
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:12,041
And now it is estimated that by 2029
 it will be 319 billion dollars. 

16
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:18,276
Amazing thing is that, 32% of the websites 
on Google are selling only online courses.

17
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:24,566
Every sixth-seventh video on YouTube 
is promoting only make money online courses. 

18
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:31,031
amazing thing is that in India, People are becoming rich by telling them how to become rich.

19
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:34,055
Are these the courses of money making gurus

20
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:38,655
Or 10 day MBA, 
courses to make you a businessman?

21
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,722
Is this course fake?
 Is it a lie?

22
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:42,926
No, this is not fake or lie

23
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:44,588
But this is a Generic course.

24
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:51,992
You are getting the same knowledge, the same knowledge or sometimes even better, for free on the internet on YouTube

25
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:56,451
Without telling you this, 
they are giving it to you in the name of the course. 

26
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,582
Then how does a person with normal IQ buy this course?

27
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:02,131
How does one get stuck?

28
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,967
How they manipulate?

29
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:07,848
The most amazing thing comes in this, 
similar to what astrologers 

30
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:09,390
First one is the Thirst Trap

31
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,036
Which means that a person is already hungry
 to become rich,

32
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:18,192
They target a common problem of humans
 and trigger it a little

33
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:21,673
Like, Let's say you're stuck in a 9 to 5 job

34
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:23,346
But you can't buy a car

35
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:30,382
"Being in a Job, I'm sure It's Going to Be Very Hard for You to Make a Lot of Money, Which Can Help You to Drive the Car Like This"

36
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:34,192
Or you want to earn money sitting,
 there is no need to work

37
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:36,846
Or you want to become rich like me

38
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:40,872
Because Gen Z feels that one day they will definitely become rich

39
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:45,514
Or the biggest Amazing thing,
 that they say that I was very poor, I had nothing

40
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,776
Now I have lakhs of rupees

41
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:53,876
"Meaning, the financial conditions of the house were very bad to spend, and as you can see now, 12 Pro Max is kept"

42
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:57,530
Hearing this, anyone thinks, man, 
he was poor and became so rich

43
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,610
Everyone wants to become rich, and from here

44
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,781
And from here that small holding awakens in their mind

45
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:05,668
Where little by little they start taking interest in it.

46
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:09,817
And Seconds, here they trap, 
Booby Trap

47
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:12,219
Which they show as show of life style

48
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:18,321
Here they show that I have this car, this is a sports car, I keep roaming around, I have a bungalow

49
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:22,666
"This live, traveling the world, I am in Dubai right now, living in the five stars, seven stars

50
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:28,446
They also show a fake account that I have so much balance in my account, I go in a private jet

51
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:33,780
Malaysian influencer took a jet on rent,
 to show off how much money I make

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,719
Similarly expensive clothes, 
expensive purses

53
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,449
Create a confirmation bias around you 

54
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:42,011
That yes, this man is earning

55
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:45,509
Then they use such words, to sell their course

56
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:51,262
10 day MBA, financial independent or big words of strange things

57
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,776
That he has acquired amazing knowledge.

58
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,328
Create very impressive ads

59
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:58,433
Only shows wealth

60
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:02,018
Like iPhone company does, 
like the company of Rolex does

61
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:06,957
They show their product only with a rich look,
 that it is not for the poor

62
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:09,417
If you are poor and want to be like us

63
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:13,471
Then they create such an ad, what a lifestyle

64
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:16,627
That ad is run everywhere

65
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:19,729
On Facebook, YouTube, Instagram

66
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:24,447
Where they give you a catchy line 
and make you click on the learn more option.

67
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,476
Below, if you want to become rich, 
you were poor like me, click on Learn More.

68
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:32,235
Here your convincing mode starts on

69
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:35,361
But here your cognitive thinking is working now

70
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:37,768
Where you know that it can be fake. 

71
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:41,620
They want to sell their course,
 just want to earn money from us

72
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,314
But this guru also knows this

73
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:50,166
To break your cognitive thinking,
 they use a word, 'Free'

74
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,360
Where they say, that we are offering a free session

75
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,752
"I have created an absolutely free training for you"

76
00:04:55,752 --> 00:05:02,736
"By attending a free training, you too can earn Rs 7 to 10 thousand per day within the next 30 days" 

77
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:07,935
I am giving a free webinar, or we are giving the registration for free, for 10 days, for 15 days

78
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,419
It will not be free after that

79
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,982
They cash the free word in such a way that

80
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:14,125
Your cognitive thinking gets broken

81
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,436
You think that it is being given for free, 
so what's the problem

82
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:19,730
Right? 
What's the problem with going and seeing?

83
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,285
So the earlier traps worked

84
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:25,250
Here you register for their webinar

85
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,740
That you are getting it for free, 
there is no problem in Free

86
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,725
And my dear, Nothing is available for free in this world

87
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:33,543
If something is being sold to you for free

88
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:35,805
Then by making a product you will be sold

89
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:39,050
Third, after registering,
 you reached their free webinar

90
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,694
The main purpose of calling here is

91
00:05:41,694 --> 00:05:45,448
That the ad you were seeing was very short, 
30 seconds, 1 minute long.

92
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:48,326
Where it was not possible to convince

93
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:51,465
Now they will keep you here for one or one and a half hour

94
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:56,311
And will create an echo chamber for you, 
will create a bandwagon effect

95
00:05:56,311 --> 00:06:00,030
Where all the psychology was used to convince you.

96
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,646
And here they will tell, first of all

97
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:05,887
How have I earned what I have earned?

98
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:09,251
I have written a book,
 these are the proofs of my account,

99
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:12,424
What he told in the video, 
he will explains in detail

100
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:16,206
This is my car, this is my net worth, 
earlier I used to live there, earlier I was poor

101
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:21,370
And to prove this, many popular faces 
will also be brought before you.

102
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,151
Which are obviously paid

103
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:27,066
Where paid TEDx interviews will also be shown, 
their sessions will be shown

104
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:30,322
You will get podcasts and videos 
with popular young people.

105
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:34,818
By including everyone, such an echo chamber 
has been created in front of you. 

106
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:37,060
You will feel that this cannot be a lie

107
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:43,187
50-40% of them are convinced to buy the course from there, that we should buy

108
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:47,701
If they are not, then they then target individual people.

109
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:50,518
In the fourth step,
 where India comes,

110
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:53,985
Most of the people in India buy these courses

111
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:59,484
Convince their parents, or tell the parents that your son is poor, his life will become better

112
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,430
Or convince that son

113
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,994
Why do these people become convinced in India?

114
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:05,832
Because two things are special in India

115
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:08,817
That it has the highest population in the world 

116
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:16,195
Secondly, the education rate here, 
the children of tier 2 and tier 3 are around 12 pass

117
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:20,032
And they are not getting jobs but they Want to become rich

118
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:22,926
And thirdly, here is the US education system

119
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:26,512
Which only prepares you for job, not for business

120
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,001
In such a situation, everyone runs in the same race

121
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:31,624
So not everyone gets a job, only one or two get it

122
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:35,440
In such a situation, unemployment is very high here, 
the numbers are very high

123
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,524
It is very easy to manipulate such people. 

124
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,980
They create their courses on trending topics

125
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,405
Most of the people buy their courses

126
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:48,755
Now after purchasing the course, people realize

127
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:51,878
That there was no value in it

128
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,712
The things mentioned in it are not lies, 
they are not wrong.

129
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:59,073
But it is not even worth the amount given.

130
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:02,421
"If you learn that course,
 you will feel that I am not learning anything special."

131
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:06,368
"What you are claiming, 
what this course claims, does not hold true at all.

132
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:11,496
I would not recommend even a single person, 
who is watching this video, to buy this course."

133
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:15,036
In fact, the guy is not even getting extra support.

134
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,617
That give us some support to make us understand this, no?

135
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:22,373
Now they say that the more hard you work,
 the more money you will earn, you will have to work hard

136
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:25,782
And people feel that 
We are not the only ones earning from this course

137
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:27,481
Because 1 or 2 people are earning,

138
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:30,745
I don't know whether they are earning or not, 
they just do advertisements.

139
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:34,445
So the person feels that maybe 
I am not able to work that hard

140
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:37,113
But no one raises questions on the course

141
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:39,204
That there could be a problem in the course

142
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:45,044
Now tell me that if 100 pots have been planted 
by some gardener

143
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:49,308
And one or two pots bloomed and 98 pots died

144
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:51,423
Then it would be the gardener's fault, right?

145
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:56,458
The gardener blames the plants for not working hard,
 these two had also blossomed

146
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,140
Now those who have bought the course get self-blaming

147
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,666
And they don't say anything, 
or there are some who do not know where to speak

148
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,624
There are children of class 10-12,
 where should they go?

149
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:10,154
Here they raise the same question that we are not earning from the course.

150
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:15,032
Then they say no problem,
 those who are not earning from this 3,000 course

151
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:19,032
We have another upgraded version on top of this, 
that is for ₹ 10,000.

152
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:20,808
You buy that, it will make you money

153
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:24,693
Then people think, maybe I will learn from there,

154
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:27,423
So he buys a course worth Rs. 10 thousand,
 but he doesn't know from there.

155
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:33,789
“So I thought, I have come this far, so let's try this course once and see if I can get success.”

156
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:36,959
Then they say buy it for 30, buy it for lakhs

157
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,960
Some people buy, some people run away, 
some people leave

158
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,223
In the end there is a very good solution left for them

159
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:50,224
That if you do not learn business from our business course, MBA course,

160
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:52,873
Then do one thing, this course we have created

161
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:56,727
You sell it to people, we will give you commission. 

162
00:09:56,727 --> 00:10:00,794
The money you paid for the course will be recovered to you.

163
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:02,781
"If you come here, you will definitely learn the business

164
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:04,800
And you know what happens at the place of business

165
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,557
They do it so that their product gets sold.

166
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,697
Sell ​​their products, nothing else is happening"

167
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:14,185
"You are saying that you took that course, after taking which you realized that there was no point in it but

168
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:19,055
Now they told you that now sell ​​the course further, 
you will get so much money"

169
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:19,869
"You will get this much money"

170
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:24,629
And for that also they give training, 
that you go in front of the school and tell the children,

171
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,277
You go to their parents, tell them

172
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:32,142
How to sell their course,
 they also give separate training for this

173
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:34,893
And it starts like an MLM business.

174
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:38,214
So, if you want to recover your money?

175
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:42,721
We've fooled you, so if you want your money back?

176
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:44,876
So you fool people too

177
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:46,544
Only then you can get money

178
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:50,034
And this loop keeps on going on and on

179
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:53,056
 There is no legal complaint about it

180
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:56,861
Because the children of 10th-12th do not even know 
how to make a legal complaint

181
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:59,258
Legal complaint cannot be made properly 

182
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,328
Because what is mentioned in the course

183
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,911
There is nothing false, 
nothing wrong in that course

184
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:07,669
But it is generic, and there is no refund policy,

185
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:10,000
Whereas a legal complaint can be made

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,939
Well, that will be done as a group,
 and with time it has happened, and will also happen

187
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,290
But let me tell you one thing, clear

188
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,893
Any number of courses on YouTube

189
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:21,322
Like how to grow a YouTube channel?

190
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:25,678
"I provide India's number 1 course on YouTube,
 I say this out of fear."

191
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:29,481
Or How to become a businessman? 
Or how to earn money?

192
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,144
Or whatever type of training courses are given

193
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:39,823
I am guaranteed that all of them are available for free on the internet and on YouTube.

194
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:45,488
You don't have to pay money to anyone to get any course, any knowledge.

195
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,592
You will find it if you search properly.

196
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:51,280
Wherever this course is being sold,
 it will be a generic course

197
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,710
Snd there is no value in it

198
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,914
And the amazing thing is that all the top businessmen

199
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,084
They didn't even do any courses or degrees.

200
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,286
Steve Jobs did not do any course degree

201
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:07,077
Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Richard Bedson or Henry Ford

202
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:10,535
And there are an infinite number 
who never did a course or degree

203
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:12,365
And the irony, it's amazing

204
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:18,307
That people are earning money by telling,
 how to earn money, wow!

205
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:23,365
If you are going to buy any kind of course on YouTube

206
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:25,830
Leave aside lakh, thousand, 500

207
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,587
Even if you are buying a course worth Rs 50, right?

208
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:29,931
Aa.. Thu...
