1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,837
My friend Mac is about to experience
the scariest moment of his life.

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,272
I'm just going to let you know
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,941
- We'll see.
- You cannot scare me.

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,075
Seal him up.

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,013
You have to survive 10 minutes
with a thousand spiders to move on.

6
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,382
Release the spiders.

7
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,051
Start the timer.

8
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,522
The reason we're doing
this is because

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,792
Mack said no matter how hard I tried,
I can't scare him.

10
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,260
Would you say you're scared now?

11
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:28,628
Getting there a little bit.

12
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:29,596
- A little bit?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,500
And this is only one of many fears
Mack will face in this video.

14
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,001
Oh, good.

15
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:39,839
And if he can successfully face all
of the fears, he will win $800,000.

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,041
I'm not going to lie,

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,209
this was way more gnarly
than I thought it would be.

18
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,578
Three, two, one.

19
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,946
Lift it up. Lift it up.

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,847
Oh yeah.

21
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,617
Congratulations on passing
the first challenge.

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,818
Let's go.

23
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,087
But Mack has to finish
all of these fears

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,790
if he wants to win
the $800,000 prize.

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,092
Mack, I know you're blindfolded,
but trust me.

26
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,360
Just walk up this ramp.

27
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,828
Raise us up.

28
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,564
Why are you taking a knee?

29
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,099
What is...?

30
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,068
Stand up. Stand up.
You're fine. You're fine.

31
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,103
No, no, no, no.

32
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:10,770
All right, Jimmy.

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,538
Okay, you can hold on to it.

34
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,539
That's cute.

35
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,008
Oh my God!

36
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,109
Okay.

37
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,278
Mack, take off your blindfold.

38
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,814
Welcome to challenge number two.

39
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,584
The next fear
is the fear of heights.

40
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,553
You're going to stand
on the end of that plank,

41
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,089
unclip this so you'll be
connected to nothing.

42
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:29,923
Nah, dude.

43
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,526
Press that button
and then freefall 200 feet,

44
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,995
and without knowing how,
trust, I'll catch you.

45
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,297
No! No!

46
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:37,997
You're shaking.

47
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,299
Yeah, of course I'm shaking.

48
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,734
I'm going to fall off of this
without a harness on.

49
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,603
- Yeah.
- I can't even see the ground.

50
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,905
Be very careful.

51
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,040
Mack, I'm just going to tell you,

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,709
even though you can't see
the ground, you are very, very high.

53
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,444
Oh, my God, Mack.

54
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,481
All you have to do is unclip it
and press that button.

55
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:55,815
Oh my...

56
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,285
I want you to look at me
in the eyes right now

57
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,489
and tell me that I'm going to fall
and something's going to catch me.

58
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,324
Something will break your fall.

59
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,325
I promise.

60
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,359
Oh my...

61
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,495
You're literally attached to nothing.

62
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,395
Oh, my God.

63
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,598
- The clip is gone.
- Oh, my God.

64
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,267
You don't have to do it.

65
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,034
If you want to,

66
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,804
you can tap out and just admit
that you are wrong and

67
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:18,938
you do get scared.

68
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,042
No way.

69
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,514
God, dude.

70
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,618
I would have to say
you look pretty scared.

71
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,319
Oh, my God.

72
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,689
Five, four,

73
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,691
three, two...

74
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,228
one.

75
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,530
Godspeed.

76
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,631
Godspeed.

77
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,398
Zero.

78
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,711
Let's go!

79
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,213
I can't believe you did it.

80
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,548
He's a psycho.

81
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,351
And if you're wondering
who my psychotic friend Mack is

82
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,087
he's actually a contestant
from a previous challenge video.

83
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,057
And sadly,
he ended up losing $800,000.

84
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,159
But now he is on challenge
three of six

85
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,061
to attempt to win that money back.

86
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,296
Here we are.

87
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,364
- Yeah.
- The next challenge.

88
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,435
What'd you get? A $5 car and put
$800,000 inside of it?

89
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,837
As you can see,
this car is pointed towards a lake.

90
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:28,074
I'm guessing you're going to want me
to drive the car into the lake?

91
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,642
No. That would be dangerous.

92
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,678
As you can see,
there's no gas pedal.

93
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,479
Obviously,
you can't drive it in the lake.

94
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,614
Yeah, I'm so stupid.

95
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,549
Why would I think
that I can drive it into the lake?

96
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,850
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Stupid. Yeah.

97
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,485
Which is why we're going to drop him
in the lake.

98
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,620
Bring in the crane!

99
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,457
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

100
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,526
It is getting real now.
Okay.

101
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,461
Oh, my God.

102
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,963
Oh, my God.

103
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,098
All right, Mack,
listen up and listen good.

104
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,635
Once we drop you at this lake,
the car will quickly begin to sink.

105
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,936
And in the back seat is

106
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,740
the 800 grand you've been competing
for divvied up into eight duffel bags.

107
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,410
However many bags you can save
from this sinking car determines

108
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,113
how much money you'll continue
competing for in this video.

109
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,415
And whatever you leave
behind is gone forever.

110
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,317
Oh my gosh, dude.

111
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,353
I will never tell you
that I'm scared,

112
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,623
but I'm about as close
as you can be right now to that feeling.

113
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,557
I can tell.

114
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,293
Before we drop your car, I'm
going to give you a one offer.

115
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,096
If you quit right now
and admit I scared you,

116
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,064
I'll give you $100,000.

117
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,232
And we call it even.

118
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,102
Yeah.

119
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:29,736
All right.

120
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,503
He's not going to take it.

121
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,939
- There's not a gosh darn chance.
- I knew that was going...

122
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,141
Hey, Nolan, take that.
I knew he was going to do this.

123
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,476
I lost it all last time.

124
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,543
It's not happening again.

125
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,578
Three!

126
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,380
Two!

127
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,381
One!

128
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,482
Oh, my God.

129
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,383
Drop him!

130
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,060
Hey Mack! You've got about 20 seconds
to break out of that car

131
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,962
before it sinks under the water.

132
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,270
Mack, the car is going under.

133
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,171
Hurry up.

134
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,014
Oh, God.

135
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,028
That car is gone.

136
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,930
That sunk so fast.

137
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,733
Oh, my God. He's out. He's alive.

138
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:34,867
Hey Mack!

139
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,369
Nolan, go grab that bag from him.

140
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,171
Somebody grab this.

141
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,376
The scariest part about this
challenge is every second

142
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,713
the car sinks deeper into the water,
making it harder to get to

143
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,081
and harder to see.

144
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,249
So if Mack wants to keep
all of the prize money.

145
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,019
He really needs to be moving
as fast as possible.

146
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,755
But as you can see,
that's not going to be easy.

147
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,968
Nolan, come here.
Take it.

148
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,805
Mack continued saving bag.

149
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,607
Oh my God.

150
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,576
After bag, after bag.

151
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,845
Mack, you're crazy.

152
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,948
But on top of the fact that the car
is sinking deeper and deeper.

153
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,284
What Mack hasn't realized yet
is that the last two bags of money

154
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,621
are actually seatbelted
into the back seat of the car.

155
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,637
Dude, Mack could be in an action movie,
honestly.

156
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,874
Well, he was like a borderline
Olympic swimmer earlier in his life,

157
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,242
which is why I did this fear.

158
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,945
Yeah, but it's like 40 feet down
and the water is freezing cold.

159
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,747
How can you hold your breath out?

160
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,921
He got another bag.

161
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,723
Well, you got $700,000 on the boat.

162
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,391
Just stop now.
Just stop now.

163
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,993
Just leave it on the bottom of lake.

164
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,561
- We can do the next.
- No.

165
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,130
All right.
He doesn't care.

166
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,831
At this point,

167
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,568
the car was literally at the bottom
of this 45 foot deep lake,

168
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:20,139
making it almost impossible for Mack
to retrieve the last $100,000.

169
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,974
Yeah you know,
I really cannot.

170
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,176
It's black down there.
There's nothing.

171
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,477
Are you officially calling it?

172
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,679
I can't see the car, Jimmy.
It's gone, yes.

173
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,247
The boat's tilting.

174
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,749
You are very athletic.

175
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,051
Do you like this video better
or the other video better?

176
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,254
Dude, this video is
like 10 times as intense.

177
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:35,655
I know.

178
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,391
And even though this looks very crazy,
there's actually seven

179
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,294
safety divers on standby
to make sure Mack didn't die.

180
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,162
Your prize is now 700 grand,

181
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,498
but from here on out, it's
all or nothing.

182
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,800
Mack has to face
the three remaining fears

183
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,102
to walk out of this
with his 700 grand.

184
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,638
- This one might be the hardest one.
- Okay

185
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,906
Is it grosser than spiders?

186
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:54,640
Just come on in.

187
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,843
Inside this room is a metal box.

188
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,044
In order to progress,

189
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,247
you'll need to reach inside the box
and pull out what's inside.

190
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,682
And before
you put your hand in the box,

191
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,816
we're going to need you
to sign this.

192
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,951
It just basically says that

193
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,019
you can't sue me
if anything in there hurts you.

194
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,522
Just sign right there.

195
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,492
All right, we got it signed.

196
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,960
What is it,
like an animal or something?

197
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,562
There are things in this box.

198
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,997
Just step up here.

199
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,665
You put your hand
in one of these holes.

200
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,066
Okay.

201
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,101
And there's a thing in here
you need to pull out.

202
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,470
Dude, that is freaky as...
Okay.

203
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,105
I'm just going to make sure it's moving.

204
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,240
- Stop.
- Okay, go for it.

205
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,042
Clearly it has not touched him yet.

206
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,246
No matter what, once you grab onto it,
you have to pull it out.

207
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,688
What you grabbed

208
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,391
is our brand new Feastable bars.

209
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,195
We got all new branding
and a better tasting formula.

210
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,297
- Let's try it together.
- I am not going to go soft on you.

211
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,832
I'm going to tell you
honestly what I think.

212
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,701
Okay, that's pretty good.

213
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,304
The new formula is milkier, creamier.

214
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,007
We have our all new crunch flavor,
the milk chocolate flavor,

215
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,576
almond flavor, my personal favorite,
and peanut butter.

216
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,178
These new and improved
Feastables bars are rolling out now.

217
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,780
Give us a couple of days
to get them on the shelves

218
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,749
of your local Walmart,
Target, 7-Eleven.

219
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,784
And I cannot wait
to see what you think of them.

220
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,653
All right, Mack,
you ready for the next fear?

221
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,488
Jimmy,
I've been in this exact same room,

222
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,156
and I've had a bunch of money
on the line before.

223
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:17,790
Yeah.

224
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,524
I'll tell you what.

225
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,794
If you give me 500 grand right now,
I'll walk.

226
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:22,995
Do you guys hear this man?

227
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,264
- Jimmy.
- Who asked for $500,000?

228
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,499
- 400 grand?
- No.

229
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:26,999
Hear me out.

230
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,169
If you said 200, maybe 250,
I would have considered it.

231
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,938
- How about 350?
- No.

232
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,240
All right, let's go.

233
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,308
Next challenge.

234
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,275
I knew he'd break.

235
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,677
All right, I might've lied.

236
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,178
That one wasn't actually that hard.

237
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,481
But this next one is actually based
on one of the scariest things

238
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,182
I've ever done.

239
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,417
There's no way.

240
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,886
How about quickly he pieced it together?

241
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,721
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
There's actually no way.

242
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,890
- Come on.
- There is actually no way, Jimmy.

243
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,191
Is it that obvious what it is?

244
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,827
What gave it away?
The tombstone with your name?

245
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:55,928
Oh, Jesus.

246
00:09:55,928 --> 00:10:00,166
For the next challenge, we are going
to bury you alive for 24 hours.

247
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,302
No way, dude.

248
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,004
And you can get out
whatever you want,

249
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,939
but you don't know what time it is.

250
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,875
And if you leave before the 24 hour
mark, you'll lose everything.

251
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,611
That's a good fear.

252
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,445
Yes.

253
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,747
For once, I'm on the other side.

254
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,748
Yeah bro!

255
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,949
Oh, my gosh.

256
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,551
It might get a little cold.

257
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,486
Nolan, don't mess it up, please.

258
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,420
I'll try not to.

259
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,522
This is from my nightmares, man.

260
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,459
It feels wrong being on
the other side, but also fun.

261
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,928
What the...

262
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,130
Oh, this is so freaky.

263
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,500
The funny thing is that
the timer hasn't even started yet

264
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,501
because you aren't fully buried.

265
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:39,171
It feels wrong saying this,
but can you bury me faster?

266
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,339
As you wish, Mack!

267
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,574
Bring in the extra hand.

268
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,010
Stop it, stop it, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

269
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,580
Let's officially start the timer.

270
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,716
Looks like 24 hours just started

271
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,184
and I'm already freaked,

272
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,452
so this ain't going to be good.

273
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,022
Mack, see that rope above your head?
Can you pull it for me real quick?

274
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,356
- Is this a trick?
- No.

275
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,394
Next time you pull that bell,
we will dig you up.

276
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,897
And if it does not say above
24 hours, you lose everything.

277
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,232
I will burn your house down.

278
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,669
And also the $700,000.

279
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,303
Yeah, I was like everything?

280
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,406
Everything.
Sweet dreams Macketh!

281
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,974
All right, don't throw the walkie talkie.

282
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,009
Was it that predictable?

283
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,512
I already know they threw it,
and I'm not even up there.

284
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,480
There's so much more fun
to be on this side of it.

285
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,849
And to make sure Mack doesn't die
in his own grave.

286
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,351
He's going to be wearing
this wristband

287
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,653
that directly tells us
his heart rate and vitals.

288
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,623
And no, it does not give him any way
of knowing what time it is.

289
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,858
Basically, I need to figure out
how to keep track of the time.

290
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,993
Here's my strategy.

291
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:37,363
I could try to stay awake
for 2 hours, sleep

292
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,233
for 10 hours, and then I would be
halfway done with the challenge

293
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,502
and I could just do that twice
and that would be good.

294
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,204
With Mack's plan now in place,

295
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,940
his first step was to pass
the time for the next 2 hours.

296
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,141
Well, it's no Feastable bar,

297
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,210
but I guess that makes hunger stop.

298
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,913
But it was pretty obvious
he was quickly getting bored.

299
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,952
Dude, you got to be honest,
there’s not much going on inside this room.

300
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,687
That's the whole point.

301
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,989
And Mack being bored this early

302
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,193
is a pretty telltale sign
that he may not be too good at this

303
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,160
because already

304
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,498
within 45 minutes, Mack's idea of time
was horrendously off.

305
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,200
I think it's been about 2 hours.

306
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,101
I'm going to try to get about

307
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,404
10 hours of sleep, which should
put me at the halfway mark.

308
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,608
Even though the pro to sleeping
is that it'll help Mack past time faster.

309
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,276
First night sleeping in the coffin.

310
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,012
The con is it's very difficult
for him to keep track

311
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,116
of how long he's been buried,
especially when he's not even able

312
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,585
to stay asleep
for more than 30 minutes at a time.

313
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,554
I have no idea what time it is right now.

314
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,056
I'm a little creeped out.

315
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,560
Hopefully for the love of God it's
been over 12 hours.

316
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,629
I think that's where we're at.

317
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,163
And because

318
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,433
when I did the challenge, I was
constantly woken up by my friends...

319
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,368
Jimmy Jam.

320
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,505
I thought I'd give Mack the same
joyful experience.

321
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,973
Wake up, Mack.
Are you okay?

322
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,643
Dude, you look like
you just got hit by a truck.

323
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,912
Kind of feels like
I did just get hit by a truck.

324
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,981
If I was to legitimately guess
how many hours in I am,

325
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:02,915
I think it's like...

326
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,886
The longer Mack stayed in the coffin,

327
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,455
the less he seemed to know
what time it was.

328
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,260
It might be hour 16.

329
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,329
And because we like to build
a lot of suspense on this channel

330
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,298
for the remainder of this fear,

331
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,901
you're not going to know
how long he's been in there either.

332
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,638
And even though Mack
wanted to ensure

333
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,573
that he was going to be there
long enough,

334
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,775
it was clear that claustrophobia
was getting to him.

335
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,378
Being in this coffin is scary.

336
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,979
Like...

337
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:35,748
That...

338
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,584
And the longer I'm in here,
the worse I feel.

339
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,352
It's a crazy feeling.

340
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,888
But eventually, when we saw
Mack begin to grab that rope,

341
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:43,589
we knew

342
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,391
he was thinking about ringing
that bell.

343
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,560
That's the face of somebody
that's about to ring this bell soon.

344
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,562
There's no way it's been under 24 hours.

345
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,531
God, I'm nervous.

346
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,800
I've been in one of these videos
before.

347
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,035
And I lost everything.

348
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,337
And the only reason
I even am back here at all

349
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,407
and got a second chance
is actually because of you guys.

350
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,610
Me screwing up that second chance
all comes down to

351
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,847
if I know for a fact it's been 24 hours.

352
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,083
I really hope I'm not making
a mistake right now.

353
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:11,951
Mack.

354
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,787
Buddy, pal, how you doing?

355
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,523
Jimmy, I'm pretty nervous.

356
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,193
I don't want to accidentally
reveal the time, so no comment.

357
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,229
Jimmy, I don't know how you do this
for seven days, dude.

358
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,830
I do not feel well in here.

359
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,464
Yeah.

360
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,699
Have you got to the point
where you start

361
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,133
to lose blood flow in your legs

362
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,370
and you feel like your back
is going to fall out of your body?

363
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,006
Jimmy, I'm thinking
about pulling this thing.

364
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:34,874
No comment.

365
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,576
Jimmy, I'll give you 50 bucks back
if you tell me what time it is.

366
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,410
No comment.

367
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,346
All right, I got a comment for you.

368
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,947
Just get a shovel ready, all right?

369
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,148
Three.

370
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,617
Oh, my gosh,
he's about to do it.

371
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,118
Two...

372
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,620
This is it.

373
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,622
One.

374
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:51,891
Stop the timer.

375
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,727
And now that Mack has made his decision.

376
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,029
There was just one
last thing I had to do.

377
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,332
Do you mind if I tell them about
Shopify while we unbury you?

378
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,500
You have got to be kidding.

379
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,669
Shopify is a platform
that helps entrepreneurs

380
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,070
get started down the path they want.

381
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,239
Sometimes starting
a business can be scary,

382
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,608
like getting covered in spiders
or being buried alive.

383
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,543
I can tell you,
you do not want to be buried alive.

384
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,778
But Shopify is here to help.

385
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,847
If I hadn't started my own business,
I wouldn't have been able

386
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,016
to go to all the crazy places
like Antarctica

387
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,717
and make videos
like these for you guys.

388
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,287
And just like billions of other
people have done with Shopify.

389
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,256
You can get started today
on your business right now.

390
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,058
Mack, you want to know
how long you were in there?

391
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,060
I have a feeling you're not going
to tell me until you dig me up.

392
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,194
You are correct.

393
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,363
And one of the perks of owning
my own business is

394
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,033
I can do fun things like send
one of my friends to the Superbowl.

395
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,303
Mack, Karl and Nolan
each have their very own football for sale,

396
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,271
and whoever's football
sells the most.

397
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,106
I'm going to give you tickets
to the Super Bowl

398
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,142
and I'm going to bury the other one
alive.

399
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,044
All that matters is that you
download the Shop app

400
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,147
and vote from one of them by buying
either Nolan's or Karl's football.

401
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,285
And now that I can afford this
video, let's see if Mack loses $700,000.

402
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,353
- Hi!
- Hi!

403
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,621
Hey, Jimmy.

404
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,189
There you go!

405
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,590
Welcome to the outside world.

406
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,327
Now that you are out of the coffin,
let's see if you were in there

407
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,361
for 24 hours.

408
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:06,699
If the number I reveal is lower
than 24 hours, then you lose $700,000.

409
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,901
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

410
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,002
Three...

411
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,303
Two...

412
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:12,938
One...

413
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,941
36 hours!

414
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,578
That is what I am talking about.

415
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:22,848
He scares me.

416
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,149
Congratulations, Mack.

417
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,885
This means that you are now
just one challenge away

418
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,220
from winning all this money.

419
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:28,921
Let's go.

420
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,289
You should probably go shower first.

421
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,191
Yeah, I smell not great.

422
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,226
So far in this video,
Mack has shown me

423
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,161
It is very difficult to scare him,

424
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,999
but the final challenge of this video
may just be Mack's worst fear ever.

425
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,435
And that's because
the final challenge of this video

426
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:47,639
is a 1 to 1 recreation of the
challenge he failed on last time.

427
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,941
The last challenge.

428
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,376
Hold this in front of your face.
Don't look.

429
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,243
- Hey, I'm not looking.
- Don't look.

430
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,045
- I'm not looking.
- All right, keep your eyes closed.

431
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,680
Don't open them.

432
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,848
Don't open your eyes.

433
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,616
Keep walking. Don't open them.

434
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,517
Don't open them.

435
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,819
All right, open them.

436
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,124
No, no, no.
I'm not doing that again.

437
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:05,824
Come over here.

438
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,961
No! Jimmy, I do not want to do this again.

439
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,096
Stand here where the cameras
can see you.

440
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,297
- No!
- Okay.

441
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,034
The last challenge
is the fear of failure.

442
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:20,372
We recreated the set where
he lost $800,000 in this video

443
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,042
And like last time,
the rules are extremely simple.

444
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,309
There are four stages.

445
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,311
Each has its own cookie with a shape on it.

446
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,114
You have to cut out all the shapes
without breaking a cookie.

447
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,684
And if you do break a cookie,
you lose $700,000.

448
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,053
And for you specifically,

449
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,088
it will have been the second time
it's happened.

450
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,090
This is from my nightmares, man.

451
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,358
I do not want to be here again.

452
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,093
Well, good.
Because I have an offer for you.

453
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,661
You can quit right now

454
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,498
and walk away with this 300 grand
or risk it for the biscuit.

455
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:50,202
And if you finish this final
challenge, win $700,000.

456
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,339
This is actually like a
very, very big decision.

457
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,943
Yeah, because that's not quite
enough, is it? It's less than half.

458
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:03,348
But if you lose again, that is $1.5
million lost on this set.

459
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,784
Are you sure?

460
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,186
He's hitting it.

461
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,787
Mac, I know this is hard,

462
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,856
but you're going to have
to make a decision here.

463
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,459
Do you want to go home with $300,000

464
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,428
or do you want to risk it all
for this final challenge?

465
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,198
All right, fine.
I'm doing it.

466
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,667
All right. To be honest, I'm glad.
I want you to win this whole thing.

467
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,168
If you look at this iPad right here,

468
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:27,272
this is exactly how long it took Mack
to get through all four stages

469
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,509
last time he did the challenge,
34 minutes and 54 seconds.

470
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,512
So that's exactly how long
I'm going to give you again.

471
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,582
Starting now.

472
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,119
Don't break the cookie while opening.

473
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:41,987
There you go.

474
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,358
Even though
he's going quick right now,

475
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,593
might not be in his best interest

476
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,928
because if he accidentally snaps a cookie,
he loses.

477
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,897
34 minutes.

478
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,768
You did it that quick?

479
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,772
Scan, scan, scan, scan.

480
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,509
It's green.

481
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,578
This is a much different deal
than last time.

482
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,148
So I'm going to take my sweet time
cutting the circle out.

483
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,315
Let's go.

484
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,452
He is flying through this.

485
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,123
Why is it so much harder to open?

486
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,791
Probably because you're like
freaking out.

487
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,793
You want me to try?

488
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,361
Open it.

489
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,462
Okay. Hold my iPad.

490
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,800
Okay. It's very hard to open.

491
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,701
What are you guys doing?

492
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,336
I don't want to be responsible for that.

493
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,040
Be careful.

494
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,076
Theoretically, Mack's strategy makes sense.

495
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,645
Getting through
the easier shapes fast

496
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,848
to save all the time for umbrella,
which he lost $800,000 off.

497
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,983
You literally still have 32 minutes left.

498
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,952
Yeah. Well, I'm going to need
all 32 of those for umbrella.

499
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,353
That is borderline impossible.

500
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,456
- Move out.
- I'm moving.

501
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,492
Open it.

502
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,227
Allow me.

503
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,031
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
Let's go.

504
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,305
Mack, stop breaking my set.

505
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,240
Bro, you guys got to make
these easier to open.

506
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,244
There's just no need to rush.
You're literally using no time.

507
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,380
I mean, you might need to go slower
on this one because it's a lot trickier.

508
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,784
This one is pretty hard,
not even close umbrella.

509
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,053
Trying to get to the race
before I start racing.

510
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,923
God, this is so hard.

511
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,102
Oh my gosh.

512
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,342
Well, I don't need that anymore.

513
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,985
Maybe it didn't break all the way through?

514
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:54,920
Okay.

515
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,489
He still had 29 minutes left.

516
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,791
He did the first two in 4 minutes

517
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,161
I don't know why I did this.

518
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,430
Oh, my God.

519
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,932
I did that twice?

520
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,333
Here.

521
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,401
Give me your hand.

522
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,770
No. Jimmy, please.
I don't want to leave yet.

523
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,372
No, Jimmy.

524
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,441
Nah, dude. I don't even know
how to feel right now.

525
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,678
Right here.
Come on.

526
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,515
I have, like, so much time.

527
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,552
Yeah. I'm still just not sure
why you were going so fast.

528
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,522
The umbrella, I just know
that umbrella takes forever.

529
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:31,723
Yeah.

530
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,493
Okay.

531
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,729
Mack told me in this video
that there was nothing

532
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,231
that I could do to scare him.

533
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,467
And after putting him through
spiders, a sinking car,

534
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,870
and more,
I really did start to believe him.

535
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,271
Godspeed.

536
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,307
The only thing that ended up
getting to Mack...

537
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,877
was the fear of his own failure.

538
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,679
Godspeed.
