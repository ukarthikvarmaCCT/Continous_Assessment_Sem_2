1
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,812
By swear of my kids.

2
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,477
Spare my life and l'll
tell you the truth.

3
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,310
He's from our village. Chief,
I don't believe my eyes..

4
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:42,847
..that an ordinary teacher is
provoking villagers against you.

5
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:45,274
He's provoking them
for not paying tax.

6
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,605
He's also abusing you.

7
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:50,649
He has abused his fate.

8
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:54,371
Now he won't remain
alive to abuse anymore.

9
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:00,900
I'll personally go to the
village to listen to his lecture.

10
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:19,481
Chief, he's that traitor
teacher who provokes villagers.

11
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:24,838
I don't provoke but awaken them.

12
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:30,873
I challenge their conscience,
and their maleness.

13
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,144
I tell them to wake up..

14
00:02:33,614 --> 00:02:37,585
..and avenge dacoit Mangal
Singh for his tyranny.

15
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,789
You speak good.

16
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:42,606
But you've forgotten..

17
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:47,672
..that you're grown up eating
food grown on my land and learned.

18
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:50,406
Its government land
and not yours.

19
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,961
Which government
you're talking about?

20
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,079
I'm the government here.

21
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,438
Everybody knows that..

22
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,743
..it's my estate since
the time of British.

23
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,444
My ancestors were
kings. I was born a king.

24
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,808
And l'll always remain a king.

25
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,413
Ego always gets crushed,
Nlangal Singh.

26
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,244
Recall Ravan
(mythological character).

27
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,782
And don't forget that Ram
(mythological character)..

28
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:17,503
"takes birth for every Ravan.

29
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,247
Villagers, did you
listen to him?

30
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:25,811
Ramchandra has
born in your village.

31
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,413
Every year, in the festival of
Dussera, you must have seen..

32
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,792
..Ravan's effigy burnt
with Ram's arrow?

33
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:37,154
But today..

34
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,164
..you'd see one more drama.

35
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,332
Tie him!

36
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,282
Good!

37
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,962
Very good!

38
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,792
Hello, inspector!
-Inspector Surendra Pal Singh.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,980
I'm second lieutenant Deepak.
-Nice to meet you.

40
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,508
I'm originally from this
village. l'm here on leave.

41
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:34,322
It's good that police once
again camped for these villagers.

42
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:35,749
That's right..

43
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:38,591
..but villagers are more scared
of police than the dacoits.

44
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,273
Instead of helping us they
think we're their enemies.

45
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,242
Inspector, poverty
has made them weak.

46
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:46,744
I beg your apology
on behalf of them.

47
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:49,406
No, it's okay.
-l'll try to convince them.

48
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:52,160
And now if the
dacoits would attack..

49
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,206
..we too will fight
along with you.

50
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:56,710
Thank you very much, Mr. Deepak.

51
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:00,045
Police needs co-operation
from the brave people like you.

52
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,337
And if you need anything else..

53
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:04,126
..you can ask for
it without hesitation.

54
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,305
Anything like food or water.

55
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:08,439
Mister, we could hardly
obtain water from your village.

56
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:10,869
I'll arrange for your food now.

57
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,011
Whatever it is, Lala.

58
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,377
Police's entry in this
village isn't good.

59
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:16,703
Because now the dacoits will
definitely come to the village.

60
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,971
Deepak, my child?!

61
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,306
Deepu!
-Mom!

62
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,139
I was waiting for
you since morning.

63
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,750
Mom, you can shower
your love later.

64
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:02,098
I'm very hungry.
I didn't eat since morning.

65
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:03,645
I'm starving now.

66
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:05,765
I know you can't starve
for a longer period.

67
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,731
C'mon, the food is ready. Come!

68
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:09,546
Mom, I want lots of food today.

69
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:13,037
I know how much you eat.
-Mom, l'm not alone.

70
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,340
There are many with me.
-Who else are there?

71
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,438
For the police officers,
on duty outside the village.

72
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:22,445
No, child. Don't commit
this mistake.

73
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,571
Otherwise, villagers
will go against us.

74
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:28,513
Dacoits attack on us because
of these police officers.

75
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:31,577
But, they used to
attack us even before.

76
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,270
Why don't you understand?

77
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:36,049
Mom, police is here to
help us. For our safety.

78
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:39,946
They're guarding our
village day and night..

79
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,275
..do they have any
enmity with the dacoits?

80
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,676
Dacoits don't rob them.

81
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:48,158
Mom, think about it. If
your son is starving..

82
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,037
..for saving a village
from dacoits..

83
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,204
..and if the villagers
won't even offer him water..

84
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,371
..how would you feel?

85
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:56,424
How hurt you'd be?

86
00:06:58,227 --> 00:06:59,297
You're right, son.

87
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:01,374
I'll cook for them now.

88
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,578
Food is really nice.
Thank you very much.

89
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:07,548
Will you thank me?
You're like my Deepu.

90
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,220
Whenever you need anything,
remember mother's house.

91
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:15,343
Surendra, l'll call
a jury meeting today.

92
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,102
I hope everything would be fine.
-Okay.

93
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,302
Okay, aunt!
-May God give you success!

94
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,009
Now, l've got
mother's blessings too.

95
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:29,556
Now, if dacoit Mangal Singh
would dare attack this village..

96
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:33,067
Take the position.

97
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,203
Deepu!

98
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:49,366
Take this!

99
00:07:57,582 --> 00:08:01,257
No, Deepu!
-Mom, don't cry, mom.

100
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:07,301
So what if l'd die? See..
there are many officers..

101
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:12,715
..who martyred for this village.
-No!

102
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,670
No, Deepu!
-There are nobody

103
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,244
to shed tears for them.

104
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:20,067
You too don't cry, mom!
Mom, don't cry. Mom..

105
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,437
No! Deepu!

106
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:55,987
Vijay!

107
00:08:57,175 --> 00:09:00,179
Sir, how long this
will continue?

108
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,505
How long our officers fall
prey to their oppressiveness?

109
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:09,162
How long we'd lose our officers
for dacoit Mangal Singh?

110
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,423
Such a powelful department..

111
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:15,436
..won't ever be able to
finish off few dacoits?

112
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:18,849
It'll, Vijay.

113
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:24,309
But the day a brave
police officer..

114
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,706
..will take charge of that area..

115
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,611
..in a complete sensible
manner and with enthusiasm.

116
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,579
Sir, don't you think
l'm capable for it?

117
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:35,849
Vijay..

118
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,743
..your distinctive service
record speaks your capabilities.

119
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:42,837
And l'm proud..

120
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:45,926
..that you showed eagerness
for this dangerous duty.

121
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,702
Mr. Chowhan!
-Yes, sir.

122
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:54,960
From the head quarter get Vijay's
transfer order issued today.

123
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:56,044
Alright, sir.

124
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,908
Now, Mr. Vijay will be
the in-charge..

125
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,638
..of Fatehgarh range.
-Thank you, sir.

126
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,741
No mom is like mine.

127
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:41,551
No dad is like mine.

128
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:45,271
No mom is like mine.

129
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:48,912
No dad is like mine.

130
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:52,764
You're a darling son
of mummy and daddy.

131
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:56,423
You're an apple of their eyes.

132
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,365
You're a darling son
of mummy and daddy.

133
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:04,105
You're an apple of their eyes.

134
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:11,087
Munna is nice. He's so nice.

135
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:19,615
Munna is nice. He's so nice.

136
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:47,516
There's only one bad
thing about, daddy.

137
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,128
He meets only on Sundays.

138
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:58,622
He's too busy.
He can't meet us daily.

139
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:02,910
There's only one bad
thing about, daddy.

140
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,269
He meets only on Sundays.

141
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:14,042
He's too busy.
He can't meet us daily.

142
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:17,841
We're not far. Now,
we'll go to such a place..

143
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,511
..where you'll meet
your daddy daily.

144
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:25,664
Then the life would be fun.

145
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:29,146
You're a darling son
of mummy and daddy.

146
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:32,962
You're an apple of their eyes.

147
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:40,625
Munna is nice. He's so nice.

148
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:48,451
Mummy is nice and
Daddy too is nice.

149
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,677
May you obtain your goal!

150
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:30,371
No dreams would
remain unfulfilled!

151
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:34,276
Dreams we've seen together,

152
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:37,812
May all our dreams be
fulfilled.

153
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:41,771
May you obtain your goal!

154
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,411
No dreams would
remain unfulfilled!

155
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,373
Dreams we've seen together,

156
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,672
May all our dreams be fulfilled.

157
00:13:53,367 --> 00:14:00,410
Now we won't separate.
We'll live and die together.

158
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,454
Now we'd never separate.

159
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:08,391
No mom is like mine.
-Really?

160
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:12,046
No dad is like mine.

161
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:18,914
Mummy is nice and
Daddy too is nice.

162
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:26,481
Munna is nice. He's so nice.

163
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:30,560
You're a darling son
of mummy and daddy.

164
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,484
You're an apple of their eyes.

165
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,581
Munna is nice. He's so nice.

166
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:49,160
Mummy is nice. She's so nice.

167
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:17,837
Salute, sir!
-Okay!

168
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,695
What's the matter, Mr. Surendra.

169
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,172
Village seems empty.

170
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:26,876
Sir, you know that villagers
don't co-operate us.

171
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,276
They think we can't
protect them from dacoits.

172
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,020
Why? 
- Because the earlier...

173
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,133
place was very insecure.

174
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:37,209
I think this place in the middle
of the village would be safe.

175
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,340
Okay! Build the tent.

176
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,483
Ramsingh! Bring the material here.
-Yes, sir.

177
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:50,075
Sister-in-law, where's Munna? 
-He was here.

178
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:51,435
Munna?!

179
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,006
Munna?!
Munna!

180
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:55,319
Munna?!

181
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:01,721
Where has he gone? Munna!

182
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,324
Munna!
-Munna!

183
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,022
Inspector!

184
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:10,434
Hey! No, smartness!
-Daddy!

185
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:13,209
Have a look around
yourself, inspector.

186
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,673
Did you see, inspector?

187
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,111
A little mistake by your side..

188
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:28,131
..can kill your
officers and your family.

189
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,771
Let go of my child, Mangal Singh.

190
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:37,044
I'll. Come into my arms.

191
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:38,259
Mangal!

192
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,977
Mangal doesn't like waiting.

193
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:45,361
If you love your child..

194
00:16:46,216 --> 00:16:50,392
..then send your
beautiful wife to me.

195
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:51,799
Daddy!

196
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,638
No, Shanti, you won't go.

197
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,008
I can't lose my son.

198
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:04,768
Let me go.

199
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:39,446
Let go of Munna.
Otherwise, l'll shoot.

200
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,573
Delicate hands can't shoot.

201
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,813
If you can shoot, c'mon.

202
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,044
Fire, Shanti.
-C'mon!

203
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:51,232
Fire!

204
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,413
Mummy! Mummy!
-Mangal!

205
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:05,490
Daddy!

206
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,138
Munna!

207
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:15,443
Munna!

208
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,139
Lover..

209
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,577
Who am I and what's my name.

210
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,880
Why are you concern
with my name?

211
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:10,232
You can call me 'Lover'.

212
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,172
Who am I and what's my name.

213
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:21,773
Why are you concern
with my name?

214
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:27,653
You can call me 'Lover'.

215
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:41,976
Lover..
-Lover..

216
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,108
My eyes and my styles
are intoxicating.

217
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:59,350
Even I know that the
world is crazy for me.

218
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:10,317
My eyes and my styles
are intoxicating.

219
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:17,051
Even I know that the
world is crazy for me.

220
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,989
In the every first
meeting, people lose heart.

221
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:23,180
God, what should I do?

222
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,216
Who am I and what's my name.

223
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:36,762
Why are you concern
with my name?

224
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,933
You can call me 'Lover'.

225
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:56,977
Lover..
-Lover..

226
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,173
Lover..

227
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,690

230
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,375
Oh!

231
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:45,222
Do you repent your crime?

232
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:54,213
Why did you do this crime?
-C'mon, answer him.

233
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:56,824
Enmity!

234
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:01,502

235
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:04,352
Death sentence.

236
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,543
Death sentence?
-Yes.

237
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:13,164
What will you do,
if you're freed?

238

One more murder.
-Whose?

239
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:24,172

243
00:22:35,661 --> 00:22:37,868
I'll become an IG like you.

244
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:41,416
I see.. what will
you do being an IG?

245
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,721
I'll cage a lion once
again, like you do.

248
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:00,668
Anand Raj, why did you
commit a murder?

249
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:04,666
I wanted to commit a
murder and I committed it.

250
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:09,317
Law wanted to punish me,
and it has.

251
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:11,765
What's bothering you?

252
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,775
Sir is asking it with
some special reason.

253
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:15,808
Go and ask government lawyer.

254
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,541
Ask the judge who punished me.

255
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,873
And still if you don't
believe then ask the victim..

256
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,847
..who died and unfortunately
she was my mother.

257
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:37,137
Name, Jung Bahadur.
Age, 30 years.

258
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,803

259
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,806
He can't speak.
He talks in signals.

260
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,409
He says, he has shaved
today, as you were coming.

261
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,747
Take him away. Take him away.

262
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,137
He's habitual of
consuming poison.

263
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,608
Doctor gives morphine
injections twice a day.

264
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,074
But, Vijay.. they.. they're only five.. 
-Two more are there, sir.

265
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,373
They're in which jail?

266
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:14,005
They were in jail but are
released few days before.

267
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,711
But l'll search for them.

268
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:17,943
They're released and youD d..

269
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,074
It's very easy to
search for them.

270
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:23,923
Whenever some sad or needy
people call for them..

271
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,007
..they rush there.

272
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,269
Have mercy on these
orphan children.

273
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,643
Where will these kids go if you
force us to vacate the place?

274
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:33,148
We're least bothered. We
didn't give birth to these kids.

275
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:35,468
Sir wants this place vacated.
-No!

276
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:38,111
I won't let you go in.
-Will you block our ways?

277
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:39,077
Move away!

278
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:43,013
Hello!
-Hello!

279
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:43,931
Who are you?

280
00:24:45,176 --> 00:24:46,086
Who're we?

281
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:49,369
You tell them.
-No, you tell them.

282
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:52,464
You tell them.
-You tell them.

283
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:59,165
Mister, actually we're
grown up in this orphanage.

284
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:02,990
And if you want to go in,
you'll have to cross our corpses.

285
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,607
I'll thrash you so hard that..

286
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:06,425
Really?

287
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:09,701
Will you thrash me?

288
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:13,049
I hope you're not lying.

289
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:16,028
I've never been beaten
by anybody in life.

290
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,480
It's my strong desire to
get beaten by somebody.

291
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:20,718
I want to get beaten.

292
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:24,227
Anybody stronger in you,
can beat me.

293
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,789
Beat me! Beat me!

294
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:27,859
then I will beat you.
- Raja

295
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,846
I feel he's strongest.

296
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:38,276
Yesterday, I had defeated him.

297
00:25:38,426 --> 00:25:43,136
Idiot! The land was
damp and I slipped on it.

298
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,677
He's right. Yesterday, it rained.

299
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:47,863
But it's dry today. C'mon,
give him two punches.

300
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,359
C'mon, give him two punches.
l'm there in your support.

301
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:51,937
C'mon, punch him.

302
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:24,513
Tell your boss, if he
has devils like you..

303
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:28,688
..then we've gods on this
land to protect this orphanage.

304
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,938
They fooled us.
-Yes.

305
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,916
Raja! Kaka! You're like
an incarnation of God..

306
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,475
..for these orphan kids.

307
00:26:41,188 --> 00:26:43,631
Don't say that and detach us
from our childhood, Master.

308
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:46,380
We se ourselves in every orphan.

309
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:48,571
Had you not sheltered us..

310
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,306
..we'd be wandering
in the streets.

311
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:56,073
You're our parents and
this orphanage is our home.

312
00:26:56,667 --> 00:27:01,776
We did it for ourselves.
For the orphans like us.

313
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,402
Raja! Kaka!

314
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:08,811
I want your help for
few such orphans.

315
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:12,726
And l'm sure you won't refuse.

316
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:18,477
What's your name?
-Raja!

317
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:20,438
Kaka! An orphan!

318
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,010
Have you grown up in orphanage?

319
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,443
We're still in the orphanage.

320
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,044
This entire world
is orphanage for us..

321
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:27,663
Except this jail.

322
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:29,428
Here we get to meet
our fathers

323
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,492
And you're our great
grand father.

324
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:32,865
Yes! -Salute!
-Salute!

325
00:27:32,964 --> 00:27:35,376
Raja!
-l'm sorry, sir.

326
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:39,190
How many times
you've been jailed?

327
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:43,567
Rampur! Siddhantpur!
Jabalpur! Nagpur!

328
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:45,893
Kolhapur!
-Yes. -Nashik!

329
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:46,936
Nashik..

330
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:47,961
Solapur!

331
00:27:48,348 --> 00:27:49,422
In Solapur!
-lt's okay.

332
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:50,685
No need to calculate.

333
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,577
Okay, tell me something.

334
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:57,438
What's the guarantee that
you'd remain loyal to DSP?

335
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:58,857
And what's the guarantee..

336
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,777
That you're loyal to
your profession?

337
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:03,826
Good!

338
00:28:04,276 --> 00:28:07,348
So many years of my
service and my record..

339
00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:09,902
..is the proof of my loyalty.

340
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:12,316
And most importantly,
I fear God.

341
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:14,956
We don't fear God.
-Why?

342
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:17,325
What has God given us?
-No parents.

343
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:21,020
No siblings.
-We only believe conscience.

344
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,365
Sir, when they don't
believe in God..

345
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,411
..how will they listen
to DSP Vijay's orders?

346
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,066
They don't have manners
while talking to somebody.

347
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:28,534
They can't even stand properly.

348
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:30,057
How will they fight dacoits?

349
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:31,173
Right you're?

350
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:32,861
This is what I want to say.

351
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:35,341
They don't have manners
while talking to somebody.

352
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:37,387
They can't even stand properly.

353
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,773
They donD t look like
police officers..

354
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,896
..neither look-wise
nor by behaviour.

355
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:45,410
And I want such people
whom villagers don't doubt.

356
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:46,877
Okay.

357
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:50,373
Today itself, l'll write to
Home Minister for permission.

358
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:55,698
You start training them.
-Thank you very much, sir.

359
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,138
Bismillah! Is everything okay?
-Yes, sir. Everything is fine.

360
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:11,471
Bismillahi I trust
your capabilities.

361
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:14,906
That's why l've brought
few dangerous prisoners.

362
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:18,210
Sir, you don't worry.
God is above..

363
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:19,799
..and Bismillah on the earth.

364
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,038
Anand Raj!

365
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:27,206
Barrack is that side.

366
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,815
Manakya!

367
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,744
Why are you laughing?

368
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:48,411
Just like that.

369
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:49,159
Goto in barrack.

370
00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:54,576
Jung Bahadur!

371
00:29:57,122 --> 00:30:00,569
He's hanged.

372
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:03,960
I couldn't save him.

373
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,560
Balwant Singh!

374
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:16,818
Barrack is on that side.

375
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,184
I know.
-Barrack is on that side.

376
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:21,617
Barrack is on that side.

377
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:22,691
Don't touch.

378
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:30,893
Police officers are stronger
than criminals like you.

379
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,688
If you live with love
and a disciplined life..

380
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:36,747
..you'd get love in return.

381
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:42,181
And if you act smart..
-Then what will I get?

382
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:43,713
A kiss?

383
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:53,476
We know the ways of
your love. Got it?

384
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:57,247
Aye!
-We're born enemies of police.

385
00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:02,708
Having enmity and taking it
out are two different things.

386
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:06,258
Will you take out enmity?

387
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,241
Take this knife.

388
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:17,365
Let's see how brave you're!

389
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:19,971
I'm already given
a death sentence.

390
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:23,241
Why do you want to lose
life? Go back to your work.

391
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:27,406
Only God has right
to kill anybody.

392
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:30,524
How will you take one?

393
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,992
C'mon, attack! C'mon!

394
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:36,109
Look, don't touch me.
-C'mon, attack.

395
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:38,000
I said don't touch me.
-C'mon, attack.

396
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:39,995
Don't touch.
-C'mon, attack.

397
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,983
Be aware, l'll attack.
-C'mon, attack.

398
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:53,235
This is formula number 44.

399
00:31:53,427 --> 00:31:56,178
You people are brought
here to teach all these.

400
00:31:57,272 --> 00:31:58,273
Take it easy.

401
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:00,613
After training, you too
will be strong like him.

402
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:03,147
Barrack is that side.

403
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:05,577
I know.

404
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:15,476
Bismillah! He's Raja
and he's Kaka! -Hello!

405
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:17,690
They've nothing to do
with those prisoners.

406
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,264
They're my men and
are here to help me.

407
00:32:21,512 --> 00:32:24,220
Listen, you'll have
to stay with them.

408
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,010
But for my sake.
Co-operate with each other.

409
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,507
Nothing will happen.
Don't fight. Is that clear?

410
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:31,475
Yes, thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

411
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:33,078
Sir!

412
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,040
Yes.

413
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:38,877
Kaka wants to say
something to you.

414
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,031
I.. I.. -Now why do you stammer?
C'mon, speak up.

415
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:44,088
What's the matte?
-You tell him.

416
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:45,514
Sure?
-Yes.

417
00:32:45,604 --> 00:32:48,676
Sir, actually..
-Why do you laugh now? Speak up.

418
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:52,375
Sir, you speak fluent English.

419
00:32:52,543 --> 00:32:54,918
We too want to learn it.
I said that.

420
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:56,841
Sure! Why not?

421
00:32:57,277 --> 00:33:01,012
Sir, get a book for us.

422
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:03,241
Bismillah, arrange for it.

423
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:06,093
You'll get it.
-Mr. Khan!

424
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,004
You know.. bring the book
along with the pictures.

425
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:12,973
Pictures. 
-Okay, l'll get the book with pictures.

426
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,344
Even the small pictures would do.
-Yes, l'll bring that.

427
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,075
- Bye
- Bye

428
00:33:19,837 --> 00:33:23,932
Earrings fell in the market.

429
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:27,757
Deputy sirs stooge have come.

430
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:32,460
Speak slowly. If they'll
hear you, they'd complain.

431
00:33:32,883 --> 00:33:39,923
I see. So, they can
even complain?

432
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:02,181
D O..
-G.

433
00:34:02,364 --> 00:34:04,776
-E-
-G!

434
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,106
Dog! Meaning..

435
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:17,628
No? Eat!

436
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:22,026
Good boys don't
study while eating.

437
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:24,410
And they don't
eat while studying.

438
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:26,207
C'mon, eat now.

439
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,662
Let's eat and then study.

440
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:05,381
Stop it!

441
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,783
What's happening? Are
you eating or fighting?

442
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:11,076
Sir, tell him, I wanted water..
-Shut up!

443
00:35:11,238 --> 00:35:12,979
Sit down! Take your seat!

444
00:35:16,675 --> 00:35:20,782
You people are not
worth behaving softly.

445
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:25,294
All of you are indecent
and audacious.

446
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:26,869
Illiterate stupid!

447
00:35:26,954 --> 00:35:28,592
Mind your language, sir.

448
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:31,749
Don't think that you're the
only literate person around here.

449
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:35,490
I know you're a DSP.

450
00:35:35,854 --> 00:35:38,630
But l'm sorry to say, you don't
know how to behave yourself.

451
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,708
First of all, enquire
about whose mistake it is.

452
00:35:41,998 --> 00:35:45,810
And then decide who should
be jailed. Understand?

453
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,765
I know my duty better than you..

454
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:49,413
..keep your mouth shut!

455
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:57,234
I brought you here to
give a new life.

456
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:00,584
A life in which, even
if you meet death..

457
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:03,811
..you'd take proud of it.

458
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,270
Nation will take pride for you.

459
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:11,061
It'll bring a new morning,
a new glory to your life.

460
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:14,064
New morning of new life.

461
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:17,846
Decision is up to you.

462
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:20,394
New life!

463
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:27,530
He'll grant us new life,
only if he'd remains alive.

464
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:13,649
You?

465
00:37:13,828 --> 00:37:15,569
You want to kill me?

466
00:37:16,662 --> 00:37:19,541
That one is used for
shaving. Keep it back.

467
00:37:20,748 --> 00:37:22,022
Take this.

468
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:24,200
Take it.

469
00:37:26,252 --> 00:37:27,128
Take it.

470
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,945
C'mon, go to sleep. Go!

471
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:43,914
If somebody would ask
you, tell him I had called.

472
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,479
Okay? Go!

473
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:53,104
What'S this?

474
00:37:58,667 --> 00:37:59,202
Go!

475
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:07,309
Take it little above. Fire!

476
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,313
If you try to aim in
the wrong direction..

477
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:47,606
We won't miss our target.

478
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:20,111
S.. N.. A.. K.. E..

479
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:31,721
Snake means serpent.

480
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:36,602
No!

481
00:39:49,424 --> 00:39:50,459
Kaka!

482
00:39:53,245 --> 00:39:55,908
Get up!
-What? -Get up!

483
00:39:56,057 --> 00:39:57,331
See there..

484
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:06,032
Sleep!

485
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:09,713
Okay.

486
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,825
Hello!
In which police station you're?

487
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,037
Perhaps, you don't know sir.

488
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:31,202
Few days before, l'm discharged
from the police service.

489
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:31,903
Why?

490
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,738
On medical ground.
-Oh, l'm sorry.

491
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,019
I came to see IG sir.
-I too have to meet him.

492
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,789
I'm in a bit of hurry. Excuse me!
-Yes, sir.

493
00:40:40,844 --> 00:40:41,914
All the best.

494
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:48,284
You called for me, sir?
-Yes, Vijay.

495
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,227
We received Home
Minister's reply.

496
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:52,878
Have we got the permission?
I was quite sure that..

497
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:55,865
What's the matter, sir?

498
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:58,505
Our request is rejected.

499
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,775
You must call the prisoners back.

500
00:41:07,308 --> 00:41:10,755
You're mad that you got
carried away in his talks.

501
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:13,612
Police officers never
care relations..

502
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:14,550
..why will they care for you?

503
00:41:14,662 --> 00:41:16,107
Great, Deputy sir.

504
00:41:16,843 --> 00:41:20,450
Thank you very much for getting
us a new life and freedom.

505
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,039
We didn't understand
your norms, DSP.

506
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,191
Sometimes, you unlock us
and sometime you lock us.

507
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:31,206
You lecture us to be
a good citizen..

508
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:35,979
..and wants to send back
to that criminal cell.

509
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:40,203
Why do you play with
our emotions, DSP?

510
00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:44,870
What right you've?
-I tried my best.

511
00:41:46,082 --> 00:41:48,926
But l'm helpless at
High Command's orders.

512
00:41:49,756 --> 00:41:54,102
Please, forgive me.
-No, sir. You won't be pardoned.

513
00:41:54,837 --> 00:41:58,216
It's not justice to disappoint
somebody after giving hopes.

514
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:01,272
They were living in the darkness.

515
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:05,063
You showed them brightness.
You gave them hopes.

516
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,522
And now you're becoming
the obstacles of their life.

517
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:13,109
No, SP. lt's a treachery
with them. A treachery.

518
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,771
Yes, l'm a betrayer.
l'm selfish.

519
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:20,683
I fooled you for
my own selfish reason.

520
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:24,786
After all, l've enmity with
Mangal Singh and not you.

521
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:29,944
He shot my wife and
kid and not yours.

522
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:31,812
Yes.

523
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,766
It's my fault that
I brought you here.

524
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:39,958
I'm an offender. I promised
to give you freedom.

525
00:42:41,045 --> 00:42:44,049
And I should be punished
for this crime.

526
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:53,353
Go! All of you can escape.
You're free..

527
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:56,564
Sir, it's against law..
-Bismillah, you won't stop them.

528
00:42:57,261 --> 00:42:58,467
This is an order.

529
00:42:59,051 --> 00:43:01,497
But you're committing a crime.

530
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,064
I'll go through it's punishment.

531
00:43:20,282 --> 00:43:21,955
Why haven't they gone?

532
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:25,016
Tell them to escape.

533
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,613
They're free.
-No, sir.

534
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,704
They won't go.
-Why?

535
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:34,207
They want to punish you.

536
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,121
What do they want?
-Your co-operation.

537
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:42,305
We never cared for our life before.
nor do we care for it today.

538
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:45,232
Now, you're our Law, sir.

539
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:49,195
Now we'll go with you.

540
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,903
I didn't understand.

541
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,628
It's very clear, sir.

542
00:43:55,789 --> 00:44:02,798
If all of us would go together.

543
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,443
Yes, that's true, we must
be careful from the police.

544
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:29,004
But, we must arrange for
weapons to fight the dacoits.

545
00:44:31,114 --> 00:44:32,218
What are they talking about?

546
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,129
Sir, we can't go
out of the forest.

547
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,401
Anybody can see us.

548
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:39,375
And anybody can inform
police for Rs 10000.

549
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:45,741
Sir, l've a solution
to obtain weapons.

550
00:44:47,134 --> 00:44:49,900
Hey, police! Police!

551
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,017

-l'll catch you.

552
00:44:55,977 --> 00:44:56,563

553
00:44:56,657 --> 00:44:58,728
I'll arrest you and
take you to the police.

554
00:44:58,985 --> 00:45:00,006
Will you take me to the police?
-Yes..

555
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,753
How many of you're there?

556
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:04,257
We're.. 1..2..3..4..5..6..7.. 8..
-8?

557
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:06,954
I'll arrest all of you.

558
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,524
But how will you arrest
us. We're so many.

559
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:11,047
And you're alone.

560
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:13,270
This is very powelful.
-This one?

561
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,969
Want to see?
-Yes. Show me.

562
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:19,681
Hold this! Hold it!

563
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:21,980

No, it doesn't have strength!
-l've more.

565

Yes, drink more. We're
more, you need more strength.

566
00:45:28,307 --> 00:45:29,786
Yes, slim body.

567
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:34,176
Hold it. -Yes.
-Don't leave it. -No!

568
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:36,947
Now see..
-Okay.

00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:45,148
I've held it. -Yes, keep

570
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:49,193
Yes! Okay. -Police!
-Don't let him go! -Police!

571
00:45:51,501 --> 00:45:52,536
Police!

572
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,676
Balwant, you were saying
something about the weapons.

573
00:45:55,734 --> 00:45:59,773
Yes, sir. I know a blacksmith,
who makes illegal weapons.

574
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:04,272
In the Raipr Village. Kalu!

575
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:07,850
So, Nlr. Balwant, you
again escaped from jail?

576
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,267
Speak softly.
I keep visiting jail.

577
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:13,498
For now I want weapons.
-Really?

578
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,416
Tell me! What do you want?
Knife, sword or spear!

579
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:22,026
Not that, I want
pistol, guns and bullets.

580
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,158
We want them at any cost.

581
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:27,498
How? lt's possible!

582
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:31,683
You want bullets, right? You'll
get it. You'll definitely get it.

583
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:34,178
It's a risky job.

584
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,943
Possible that you'd get
so many bullets that..

585
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,171
..you won't need more.

586
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:41,911
And possible that you
obtain the entire delivery.

587
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:43,512
From where?

588
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:47,480
Promise me. Even if you
survive, you won't come here.

589
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,105
I promise I won't come. Tell me.

590
00:46:51,718 --> 00:46:54,460
That delivery comes
for dacoit Mangal Singh.

591
00:46:55,267 --> 00:46:57,110
From where?
-I don't know.

592
00:46:57,434 --> 00:46:58,818
I only know the
place where it comes.

593
00:46:59,104 --> 00:47:00,139
Where?

594
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,291
Chandanpur! Petrol pump!

595
00:47:04,426 --> 00:47:05,837
Durjan's restaurant.

596
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:09,106
Hail Ram! Hail Ram!

597
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:12,273
Say hail Ram! Hail Ram!

Say hail Ram! Hail Ram!

600
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:20,713
I meet different people
in the form of friends.

601
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:28,585
They claim to be fans and
show me coloulful dreams.

602
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:34,880
Nobody is friend here.

603
00:48:35,142 --> 00:48:39,852
Nobody loves here.
l've seen that.

604
00:48:42,157 --> 00:48:43,932
I've seen that.

605
00:49:40,267 --> 00:49:43,942
On my dark tresses,
intoxicated eyes..

606
00:49:44,088 --> 00:49:47,865
..many are ready to die.

607
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:51,964
Thirsty hearts invite me..

608
00:49:52,086 --> 00:49:56,000
..and promise, life
is noting without you.

609
00:49:56,037 --> 00:50:02,420
Nobody speaks the truth. All
are liar here. l've seen it.

610
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:08,707
I've seen that.

611
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:09,873
My fans follow me
everywhere I go.

612
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:13,961
Who do I accept and
who do I reject?

613
00:51:14,046 --> 00:51:17,804
Everybody want to my consent.

614
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:26,752
I don't trust them. Nobody
is loyal. l've seen it.

615
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,275
I've seen it.

616
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,820
- Wait, let me count cash.
- Wait,  Sage, stop!

617
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:52,940
Stop, sage, where are you going?

00:51:58,653 --> 00:51:59,757
She's my daughter.

621
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:01,742
Your daughter?
-Yes. -Then bless me!

622
00:52:01,834 --> 00:52:03,711
Sage, why are you

-You don't know..

625
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:16,480
..the quality, the art,
the beauty she has..

626
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:20,792
I tell you, you too
must seek her blessings.

627
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:24,042
He's not a sage, but a dacoit.

628
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,632
Sage, you're a biggest
dance master.

629
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:27,837
Teach her something.

00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:38,075
Who will you arrest?
-They all are dacoits.

635
00:52:47,759 --> 00:52:50,262
You can arrest all of them.

636
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,059
C'mon, sit here.
-l've caught. I won't release.

637

You made me sit?
-Yes.

638
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,392
You do one thing.

00:52:58,956 --> 00:53:03,302
You sit here and
l'll call the police.

640
00:53:03,574 --> 00:53:05,035
Don't move!

641
00:53:05,317 --> 00:53:07,194
Just don't move! l'll call..

642
00:53:07,577 --> 00:53:12,151
I'm moving. I understood.
You're very clever.

643
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,310
You'll escape if I go.
It won't do.

644
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,408
I'm very intelligent.

645
00:53:18,523 --> 00:53:22,835
I'll sit here. You go
and call the police.

646
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,978
Hey.. you're very clever.

647
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:32,833
You may escape from there.
What will I do sitting here?

648
00:53:32,874 --> 00:53:34,080
Both of us will sit here.

00:53:34,384 --> 00:53:36,591
I'll arrest all of
them and you too.

650
00:53:36,859 --> 00:53:41,035
Yes, wrestler! You need to
have guts to nab 8-9 people.

651
00:53:41,157 --> 00:53:42,158
That's right.

652
00:53:42,234 --> 00:53:47,563
And there's liquor to gain guts.

653
00:53:47,863 --> 00:53:49,240
Is it?
-Yes.

654
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:52,778
It'll be fun!

655
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:56,185
Do you want me to drink more..

656
00:53:56,293 --> 00:53:58,239
..and lose sense and
want to escape?

657
00:53:58,434 --> 00:54:01,711
No, I won't escape.
-I won't drink liquor. No.

658
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:05,797
They're very daring people.

659
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:09,483
I too am a daring personality.
-They punch very hard.

660
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,405

00:54:13,774 --> 00:54:16,389
They'll punch you.
-I too will punch them.

665
00:54:21,237 --> 00:54:22,652
They'll throw liquor
bottle at you.

666
00:54:22,713 --> 00:54:24,693
I too will throw bottle at them.

667
00:54:24,873 --> 00:54:27,149
They'll open the
lid and throw it.

668
00:54:27,408 --> 00:54:29,183
I too will open
the lid and throw.

669
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:30,706
Then they will take
a sip and throw.

670
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:32,493
I too will sip and throw.

671
00:54:33,844 --> 00:54:35,379
They'll drink more and throw.

672
00:54:35,534 --> 00:54:37,536
I too will drink more and throw.

673
00:54:40,826 --> 00:54:45,332
Hey.. you're very smart!
-What happened?

674
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:49,231
You made me drink liquor
and want to escape?

675
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:53,126
No, I won't escape. l'm here.
-You won't escape? -No.

676
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,635
Hold my hand.
-Yes, l've held it.

677
00:54:55,848 --> 00:54:57,013
Slowly!

678
00:54:57,924 --> 00:54:59,062
Don't release it.

679
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:07,910
There comes the delivery.

680
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:12,171
I've kept the boxes.

681
00:55:12,567 --> 00:55:14,604
Place it in the bullock
carts and send it to chief.

682

We'll check it.
You take your charge.

683
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:22,348
Sages, it's very fortunate
to meet five sages together.

684
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:23,618
Suggest me how do I serve you?

685

You want to serve us?
-Yes.

Then arrange for a meal for us.

687
00:55:28,724 --> 00:55:30,397
Come and sit in the tent, sages.

688
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:36,717
Not in the sages. We'll eat
in the restaurant with public.

689
00:55:36,806 --> 00:55:39,912
Come, sages.
Please, come. Please..

690
00:55:40,234 --> 00:55:42,009
How can I serve you?

00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,343
How will you serve us, child?

692
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:49,060
Just serve some food to the sages.
-Please, come.

693
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:50,474
Please, give some place, mister.

694
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:51,899
Come, sages.
- No!

695
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:54,372
This place is not pure.

696
00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:57,830
We'll make our place
somewhere else.

697
00:55:58,434 --> 00:56:01,847
Say hail Ram! Say hail Ram!

698
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:11,263
They're taking our boxes..
-They're sages.

699
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,345
They'll eat and leave.

700
00:56:13,934 --> 00:56:15,936
If there's something untoward..

701
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:19,577
What will you eat, sages?

702
00:56:19,634 --> 00:56:21,580
Vegetables? Curry?

703
00:56:21,867 --> 00:56:24,006
Don't you have
non-vegetarian food?

704
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,214
Sages, you're non-vegetarian?
How's it possible?

705
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,441
It's because what's
possible is possible.

706
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,109
And what's impossible,
is impossible.

707
00:56:34,867 --> 00:56:36,471
Possible could be impossible.

708
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:39,313
But impossible could
never be possible.

709
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:43,366
But, turning impossible
into possible and possible..

710
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:46,239
..into impossible is
ourjob. Did you get it?

711
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:50,491
We need third eye of
Lord Shiva to explain it.

712
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:56,477
Sage! -And God has given us
this order today.

713
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:02,767
Lord, do you permit us?
-Yes.

714
00:57:05,827 --> 00:57:07,738
Miracle! Miracle!

715
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,667
Sage, you've direct
contact with God.

716
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:14,718
Trust me, child.
You'll be blessed.

717
00:57:20,472 --> 00:57:22,349
Sit here.
-Where are you going?

718
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:24,598
I'll call the police.

00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:28,266

You never drank it?
-Never.

725
00:57:41,308 --> 00:57:43,310
Water can sober down
your intoxication.

726
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:44,665

-Yes.

00:57:45,353 --> 00:57:48,766

Water is very nice.

734
00:58:07,024 --> 00:58:08,628
It's a municipality tap.

735
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,054
Water, what's your colour?

736
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:15,849

How many people were there?
-Three.

750
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:09,857
Who are these people?

751
00:59:10,029 --> 00:59:12,066
They're villagers
having their meals.

752
00:59:13,867 --> 00:59:17,405
Listen! -6 to 7 prisoners
have escaped. -Okay.

-Okay, sir.

Great! Sages and
non-vegetarian food?

756
00:59:32,551 --> 00:59:37,214
Good! -Inspector!
lt's possible but impossible.

757
00:59:37,434 --> 00:59:40,558
Possible has made
it impossible and..

758
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:42,229
"impossible has made
it possible.

759
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,652
Both have confused each other. 
-I know it very well.

760
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:49,154
What's there in these boxes?

761
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:52,994
They were lying there? We
took it for our comfort.

762
00:59:53,229 --> 00:59:54,207
Hail Ram!

763
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:57,748

01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:16,129

785
01:03:35,334 --> 01:03:36,813

797
01:04:35,896 --> 01:04:38,433

01:04:44,901 --> 01:04:46,574
Somebody go bring

803
01:04:56,211 --> 01:04:58,384
I'm here to take this

804
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:01,368
Hey, old man! Have you gone mad?

805
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:04,911

Let him take it away.
-I knew it.

01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,190
Keep your pistol.

811
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:32,978
It's very little.
But never mind.

812
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:37,107
Now tell your men to let
the villagers take away..

813
01:05:37,259 --> 01:05:41,332
..money and food grains.
-But..

814
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,707
Listen! Look into your left.

815
01:05:45,645 --> 01:05:46,487

816
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:52,368
Now look down.

817
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,492
 Now Look into your right.

818
01:06:01,534 --> 01:06:03,275
Oh! l'm sorry.

819
01:06:05,534 --> 01:06:06,569
Did you saw?

820
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,678
He's saluting you! Reply him!

821
01:06:11,904 --> 01:06:13,315

01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,359
Now speak up.

823
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:19,249
We..
-What?

824
01:06:19,972 --> 01:06:22,439
I've decided to
return the villagers..

825
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:24,861
..their money and food grains.

826
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:28,668
Baldy! Brother,
return their grains.

827
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:30,997
Villagers, you can
take away your grains.

828
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:34,486
Great!

829
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:43,216
Now? -Now tell your men to
place their guns on the bed.

830
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:47,880
Place your guns on the bed.
-Yes, to take some rest.

831
01:06:48,864 --> 01:06:51,003
Take rest! Take rest!

832
01:06:54,677 --> 01:07:01,094
Now? -Now, tell your men
to stand facing each other.

833
01:07:01,259 --> 01:07:03,170
All of you stand
facing each other.

834
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:04,316
In a queue!

835
01:07:09,934 --> 01:07:11,777
Now tell them to slap each other. 
-No.

836
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:13,173
This won't be good.

837
01:07:13,438 --> 01:07:15,975
It'd be very good. You don't
understand. C'mon, say it.

838
01:07:16,108 --> 01:07:18,137
C'mon.
-Now slap each other.

839
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:27,049
No, I didn't enjoy it.
-No?

840
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:29,340
No, tell them to punch harder.

841
01:07:29,434 --> 01:07:31,940
Speak up loudly!
-Punch harder.

842
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:50,786
Okay, now tell that man
to hit on the baldy's head.

843
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,290
No, he's a dangerous man.
-He's less dangerous than me.

844
01:07:55,934 --> 01:07:58,244
Tell him to hit on baldy's head.

845
01:07:58,334 --> 01:08:00,336
And don't call him brother.

846
01:08:02,199 --> 01:08:03,678
Hit on the baldy's head.

847
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,773
Hey..

848
01:08:18,657 --> 01:08:21,228
What nonsense is this?
Don't you love life?

849
01:08:21,467 --> 01:08:23,970
That's why l'm
saying this nonsense.

850
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:26,872
You too would have said that
had you been in my place.

851
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,874
Listen to me.
lt's your chief's order.

852
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:32,038
Chief! Chief!

853
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,104
It's not happening for
good. l'm telling you.

854
01:08:50,267 --> 01:08:51,940
But I like it.

855
01:08:58,294 --> 01:08:59,534
Shall I smoke?
-Yes.

856
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:01,103
You want?
-No, I don't smoke.

857
01:09:07,396 --> 01:09:09,706
I don't understand why
do you do this business?

858
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,850
Taking away their grains,
why you do all this?

859
01:09:12,497 --> 01:09:13,635
I'm helpless.

860
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:16,993
You kept..
-With respect.

861
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,961
You placed gun here. And
I followed your order.

862
01:09:20,107 --> 01:09:23,645
Mangal Singh places gun
here so I follow his orders.

863
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,372
What should I do?

864
01:09:27,965 --> 01:09:28,733
You go away from here.

865
01:09:29,034 --> 01:09:33,676
Yes. -And live a respectful
life. Okay? Go!

866
01:09:33,834 --> 01:09:34,710
And listen!

867
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:37,206
My friends..
-Yes..

868
01:09:37,408 --> 01:09:38,853
Who?
-He..

869
01:09:41,982 --> 01:09:45,156
My God! He..
-He..

870
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,004
And him..

871
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,544
Be careful from them.
Villagers don't fight.

872
01:09:59,634 --> 01:10:01,045
Just save yourself
from them and escape.

873
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,307
Okay, I'll.
-C'mon, run! -l'll..

874
01:10:03,813 --> 01:10:05,315
I hope you won't
shoot from behind.

875
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,042
See this!

876
01:10:13,068 --> 01:10:14,513
It's empty?!

877
01:10:15,102 --> 01:10:16,137
It's empty!
-Yes.

878
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:17,462
It's empty?
-Yes.

879
01:10:17,788 --> 01:10:23,602
It's empty? Kill me! Kill me,
l'm not fit for being a dacoit.

880
01:10:23,717 --> 01:10:26,391
Kill me. Kill me.

881
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:29,279
No! l'll go.. l'll go away.

882
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,678
I'll go somewhere far.

883
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,945
Tell your chief to personally
come and collect the tax.

884
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,408
Go!
-Get lost!

885
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:42,078
Well done! Well done!

886
01:10:42,601 --> 01:10:44,638
You've done a miracle.

887
01:10:45,101 --> 01:10:46,205
Who are you?

888
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:49,177
Your friends and dacoit's enemy.

889
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:55,206
Now dacoit Mangal Singh can't
raid any village till we're there.

890
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,871
If you trust us.

891
01:10:57,934 --> 01:11:01,177
Why not? We completely
trust you. Right, brothers?

892
01:11:01,267 --> 01:11:03,178
Yes! Yes!
-Well said!

893
01:11:14,501 --> 01:11:16,003
Did you see how
they ran away, Kaka?

894
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:21,192
Child, will you stay with me?

895
01:11:22,434 --> 01:11:24,380
In my house?

896
01:11:24,734 --> 01:11:27,146
I'll cook food for you.

897
01:11:29,145 --> 01:11:30,647
What are you thinking, child?

898
01:11:31,535 --> 01:11:34,015
Don't you think
l'm like your mother?

899
01:11:56,735 --> 01:11:58,123
Come, child! Come!
-Yes.

900
01:11:58,542 --> 01:12:00,852
Consider it your own house.
-Okay.

901
01:12:01,303 --> 01:12:02,976
Come, child.

902
01:12:04,642 --> 01:12:06,952
Hey, why have you stopped?

903
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:10,684
Come inside.
-Yes.

904
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:13,772
You didn't like
your mother's house?

905
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,821
No! -Yes! -Yes!

906
01:12:16,518 --> 01:12:19,829
What's this? Why are
you giving short answers?

907
01:12:20,801 --> 01:12:23,441
Can't you call me mother?

908
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:24,315
Mother!

909
01:12:29,203 --> 01:12:30,079
Mother?!

910
01:12:30,378 --> 01:12:31,254
Mother?!

911
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:33,896
Only mother? Nothing else?

912
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,746
Had there been my Deepu..

913
01:12:38,767 --> 01:12:41,338
I'm very hungry. I didn't
eat anything since morning.

914
01:12:41,434 --> 01:12:42,742
I'm starving.

915
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,638
Come! Come, child. Come inside.

916
01:12:46,999 --> 01:12:47,739
Come!

917
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:52,437
Come!

918
01:12:55,067 --> 01:12:55,977
Sit down!

919
01:12:57,901 --> 01:13:00,211
Child, l'll bring milk for you.

920
01:13:03,223 --> 01:13:04,327
Sit down!

921
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,861
You don't even demand
anything to your mother.

922
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:26,558
Have you seen anybody
keeping distance from mother?

923
01:13:27,396 --> 01:13:30,843
Had there been my Deepu,
he'd have drank all the milk.

924
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:35,705
And have asked for more.

925
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,377
Again you got up? Sit down!

926
01:13:50,434 --> 01:13:51,640
I've brought milk.

927
01:13:52,435 --> 01:13:54,244
Don't touch it.

928
01:13:55,488 --> 01:13:57,434
I'll make you drink it.

929
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:22,314
What's the matter,
child? Why are you crying?

930
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:27,303
You speak up.

931
01:14:29,734 --> 01:14:30,838
You speak up.

932
01:14:32,867 --> 01:14:34,039
Mother!

933
01:14:36,267 --> 01:14:41,182
Actually, till date, nobody
talked lovingly with us.

934
01:14:42,754 --> 01:14:45,826
Nobody offered us food to eat.

935
01:14:47,207 --> 01:14:49,687
And.. even if we're offered..

936
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:54,177
..it was thrown to us
like how you feed animals.

937
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,101
Yes, mother.

938
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,358
We had to eat that
to satisfy our hunger.

939
01:15:01,804 --> 01:15:05,013
That's why we learnt
to snatch away things.

940
01:15:06,617 --> 01:15:07,493
Mother,

941
01:15:09,301 --> 01:15:11,838
we don't have a mother.

942
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,679
We're orphans!

943
01:15:17,218 --> 01:15:22,065
No, my child. you're not
orphans. l'm your mother.

944
01:15:22,339 --> 01:15:23,909
Mother!
-l'm your mother.

945
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,471
Child, have one more chapatti.

946
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:41,571
No, mother! l'm tired
of eating. lt's enough.

947
01:15:41,634 --> 01:15:43,511
It's from mother's share.
Take it.

948
01:15:43,967 --> 01:15:44,968
You too take it, my child.

949
01:15:45,034 --> 01:15:46,775
Mother, if you'll
serve us everything..

950
01:15:46,867 --> 01:15:48,005
..you'll remain starving.

951
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:50,172
There's enough food.
l'll eat later.

952
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,970
No! Not later. Now
we'll feed you morsels.

953
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,440
Child..
-Hey..

954
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:57,510
No, mother.. let me feed you..

955
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:09,344
Child, l'm fasting today.

956
01:16:09,712 --> 01:16:11,453
So l'll cook it later and eat.

957
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:14,205
Okay, mother.

958
01:16:14,513 --> 01:16:17,619
Henceforth, we too will
fast along with you.

959
01:16:19,734 --> 01:16:22,340
And we'll eat
only when you'd eat.

960
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:35,205
Mother is a mother..

961
01:16:35,874 --> 01:16:39,617
Mother is a mother..

962
01:16:40,201 --> 01:16:47,085
There's no comparison
to a mother.

963
01:17:24,401 --> 01:17:28,679
Mother is a mother..

964
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:33,680
There's no comparison
to a mother.

965
01:17:34,168 --> 01:17:38,480
Mother is a mother..

966
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:43,247
There's no comparison
to a mother.

967
01:17:43,457 --> 01:17:47,405
O mother..

968
01:17:48,301 --> 01:17:51,009
O mother..

969
01:17:51,101 --> 01:17:53,411
Mother is a mother..

970
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:55,640
Mother is a mother..

971
01:17:55,861 --> 01:18:00,435
There's no comparison
to a mother.

972
01:18:23,877 --> 01:18:28,743
You're my temple
and my worship.

973
01:18:28,867 --> 01:18:32,644
You're a boon to me.

974
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,049
You're my world.

975
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:41,735
Both the world lies
at your feet.

976
01:18:42,967 --> 01:18:47,575
You're my temple
and my worship.

977
01:18:47,834 --> 01:18:52,146
You're a boon to me.

978
01:18:52,388 --> 01:18:56,859
You're my world.

979
01:18:57,034 --> 01:19:00,846
Both the world lies
at your feet.

980
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:05,679
You're the other
image of Lord.

981
01:19:05,895 --> 01:19:10,474
I see Lord in you.

982
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:33,908
Mother, your love
flows uninterruptedly.

983
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:38,039
Your shadow is like a heaven.

984
01:19:38,667 --> 01:19:46,176
Nobody can love us like you.

985
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:52,397
Mother, your love
flows uninterruptedly.

986
01:19:52,522 --> 01:19:55,538
Your shadow is like a heaven.

987
01:19:57,229 --> 01:20:04,518
Nobody can love us like you.

988
01:20:05,674 --> 01:20:13,385
Motherless children know
your real value, mother.

989
01:20:15,354 --> 01:20:19,463
Mother is a mother..

990
01:20:19,979 --> 01:20:24,492
Mother is a mother..

991
01:20:45,334 --> 01:20:49,783
Apple of your eyes passed away.

992
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:53,156
And your dreams shattered.

993
01:20:54,400 --> 01:21:02,376
We'll share your grief
and wipe your tears.

994
01:21:03,476 --> 01:21:07,616
Apple of your eyes passed away.

995
01:21:08,053 --> 01:21:11,432
And your dreams shattered.

996
01:21:12,548 --> 01:21:20,377
We'll share your grief
and wipe your tears.

997
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:25,381
You're not alone.
You're not helpless.

998
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:30,138
Now we're your
support, mother.

999
01:21:30,163 --> 01:21:31,904
Mother is a mother..

1000
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:34,510
Mother is a mother..

1001
01:21:35,007 --> 01:21:38,978
There's no comparison
to a mother.

1002
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:43,229
O mother..

1003
01:21:43,701 --> 01:21:46,409
O mother..

1004
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,444
Friends..

1005
01:22:15,267 --> 01:22:17,543
What's the punishment we give
to he who escape? -Death!

1006
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:19,243
Death!
-Okay.

1007
01:22:19,934 --> 01:22:25,782
But I don't want to reduce
my strength by killing my men.

1008
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:30,143
He had gone to collect
ration for us.

1009
01:22:30,767 --> 01:22:32,906
But he returned empty handed
and that too running away.

1010
01:22:32,967 --> 01:22:34,571
And while running away,

1011
01:22:35,164 --> 01:22:39,510
..he must have
used up his energy..

1012
01:22:39,834 --> 01:22:41,745
So feed him something.
-Yes. Take this.

1013
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,074
No!
-Eat an egg.

1014
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,841
Give him cock.
-Yes.. -No. -Eat it.

1015
01:22:48,277 --> 01:22:51,724
I'll make you eat more
and make you powelful..

1016
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:54,213
..so that you'd never return
empty handed in future.

1017
01:22:55,979 --> 01:23:01,361
Chief, order me.
I can bring them alive.

1018
01:23:01,634 --> 01:23:05,597
Bring them. -Then he too
will accompany you.

1019
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:10,148
No! I won't go.
-You won't go? -No..

1020
01:23:10,546 --> 01:23:11,923
I won't go.

1021
01:23:14,601 --> 01:23:16,478
You won't go?
-No, I won't.

1022
01:23:16,588 --> 01:23:18,124
You won't go?
-No, I won't.

1023
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:20,951
You won't go?
-No, I won't.

1024
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,646
You won't go?
-Yes, l'll.

1025
01:23:40,867 --> 01:23:43,541
What happened? -Don't go inside.

1026
01:23:43,734 --> 01:23:45,771
They're the one
who met me before.

1027
01:23:45,867 --> 01:23:48,363
They're terrible.
-Are we any less?

1028
01:23:48,595 --> 01:23:49,767
We too have a gun.

1029
01:23:50,001 --> 01:23:53,278
Break open the door
and bring them out.

1030
01:23:53,401 --> 01:23:54,709
Listen to me.

1031
01:23:54,834 --> 01:23:56,939
This time we'll return
and tell chief..

1032
01:23:57,034 --> 01:23:58,672
..that they were
not at home. -Look,

1033
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:03,615
l'll kill you now.
-You too talk like him.

1034
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,875
Gun! Gun! l'm going.

1035
01:24:09,988 --> 01:24:11,058
Should I go?

1036
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,772
Hey, it was open!

1037
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:18,571
It was already open.

1038
01:24:20,387 --> 01:24:23,163
You?
-Yes, it's me.

1039
01:24:23,367 --> 01:24:25,027
I mean it's me.

1040
01:24:25,467 --> 01:24:27,071
Look! Just listen to me.

1041

Please, come out.
-Why?

1042
01:24:29,134 --> 01:24:31,205
Look, l'm already
thrashed enough at my den.

1043
01:24:31,267 --> 01:24:33,213
My accomplices
are waiting outside.

1044
01:24:33,567 --> 01:24:35,843
Please come out.
Try to understand.

1045
01:24:35,967 --> 01:24:38,174
Who will go first? You or I?
-Anybody..

1046
01:24:38,357 --> 01:24:40,462
No, you'll go first.
-With respect.

1047
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,036
Yes, you please go first.
-Okay..

1048
01:24:43,266 --> 01:24:44,108

Slowly! Walk slowly!

1050
01:24:47,001 --> 01:24:48,241
Welcome!

1051
01:24:48,733 --> 01:24:52,502
Friends, have you seen a
camel under the mountain?

1052
01:24:52,646 --> 01:24:55,388
And if not, then see them.

1053
01:24:58,534 --> 01:25:01,378
Your men hasn't seen a mountain..

1054
01:25:01,434 --> 01:25:02,845
..how will they see camel?

1055
01:25:03,067 --> 01:25:04,944
Are you imitating me?

1056
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:08,014
Who's interested
in imitating you?

1057
01:25:08,053 --> 01:25:09,657
I speak like this
since childhood.

1058
01:25:09,873 --> 01:25:11,978
I speak like this
since childhood.

1059
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:15,799
Yes, you're carrying gun. So
your childhood is still not over.

1060
01:25:15,995 --> 01:25:18,202
If you don't trust me,
ask your man.

1061
01:25:19,007 --> 01:25:22,045
Tell him.
-C'mon, tell me.

1062
01:25:23,367 --> 01:25:25,643
Yes, he speaks like this.

1063
01:25:25,862 --> 01:25:30,504
You speak like this. He too
speaks like that and I too.

1064
01:25:30,713 --> 01:25:33,592
I wish the entire world
to speak like that.

1065
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:37,772
Like that.. -Enough now.
I understand everything.

1066
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:41,911
Now get ready to die,
guys! Okay?

1067
01:25:43,069 --> 01:25:45,733
Look, if you want to
kill, kill me first.

1068
01:25:45,844 --> 01:25:51,351
I'm younger. -No, l'm elder
to him. First you kill me.

1069
01:25:51,567 --> 01:25:54,572
No, Raja, l'll die
first. -No! -Kill me.

1070
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:01,941
Here it is.

1071
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:09,650
I told you.. I told
you not to come here.

1072
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:16,410
I see, so its you?

1073
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,526
Don't you have any other work?

1074
01:26:18,714 --> 01:26:20,033
You neither sleep nor
do you let others sleep.

1075
01:26:20,152 --> 01:26:24,464
Never mind. -We'll massage them
properly.. -And make them sleep.

1076
01:26:24,808 --> 01:26:25,684
Let's go.

1077
01:26:26,401 --> 01:26:28,108
C'mon!
-Move!

1078
01:26:31,012 --> 01:26:32,389
What's the matter?

1079
01:26:33,267 --> 01:26:34,746
What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

1080
01:26:34,866 --> 01:26:37,642
What should I do?
lt's my destiny.

1081
01:26:37,667 --> 01:26:40,904
I told you, it's not
your cup of tea.

1082
01:26:41,169 --> 01:26:42,216
Then why did you come here?

1083
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:43,577
I'm helpless!

1084
01:26:43,734 --> 01:26:47,045
Chief kept me on gun point
and I came to the village.

1085
01:26:47,534 --> 01:26:49,309
You..
- With respect.

1086
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,347
You kept me on gunpoint
and I returned.

1087
01:26:52,634 --> 01:26:55,547
Again chief kept me
on gunpoint..

1088
01:26:59,393 --> 01:27:00,337
Listen,

1089
01:27:02,209 --> 01:27:04,211
l'm giving you last chance.
-Okay.

1090
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,639
If I see you again
in this dress..

1091
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,105
..or if you try to
become a dacoit again..

1092
01:27:09,434 --> 01:27:13,075
..l'll brutally kill you.
-No. Don't kill me. -Go.

1093
01:27:13,134 --> 01:27:14,613
I'm going.
-Get lost! -Yes..

1094
01:27:15,467 --> 01:27:22,336
Earrings fell in
the market place..

1095
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,501
What's happening, Sher Singh?

1096
01:27:31,601 --> 01:27:34,480
Nothing. I was just passing by.

1097
01:27:35,067 --> 01:27:36,068
This way?

1098
01:27:36,234 --> 01:27:39,306
Yes, I was going on the
farm. But, on the way..

1099
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,404
A tree came in.
-Yes. a tree came in.

1100
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,480
But it's fruitless, Sher Singh.

1101
01:27:45,845 --> 01:27:48,451
You're right. -Go back
to your work. -Okay.

1102
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:53,578
Earrings fell in
the market place..

1103
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:12,441
Ever since he's here
in this village..

1104
01:28:12,934 --> 01:28:14,743
..he keeps drinking liquor.

1105
01:28:16,267 --> 01:28:17,712
I understand his pain.

1106
01:28:18,301 --> 01:28:20,110
He hasn't obtained
a motherly love.

1107
01:28:20,701 --> 01:28:23,682
His mother left him
when he was too young.

1108
01:28:24,467 --> 01:28:26,469
He hates a word 'mother'.

1109
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:29,412
And when he grew up,
he killed his mother.

1110
01:28:30,334 --> 01:28:32,644
Now, he's always drunk.

1111
01:28:34,067 --> 01:28:37,640
Bismillah, I hope I have
not committed a mistake..

1112
01:28:39,601 --> 01:28:41,205
What are you saying, sir?

1113
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:43,638
Look at Raja and Kaka.
They're so happy.

1114
01:28:44,938 --> 01:28:47,316
Sir, look there.

1115
01:28:51,912 --> 01:28:53,789
Sir, look there too.

1116
01:28:57,713 --> 01:29:00,785
They've so very well
mixed in the village.

1117
01:29:02,601 --> 01:29:04,706
You don't worry, sir.

1118
01:29:05,601 --> 01:29:06,739
By God's grace,
everything will be fine.

1119
01:29:06,834 --> 01:29:08,711
What's your opinion
about me, sir?

1120
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,344
You and here?

1121
01:29:14,007 --> 01:29:15,645
You were sick, right?

1122
01:29:16,088 --> 01:29:17,089
Yes, sir.

1123
01:29:18,135 --> 01:29:21,412
L'm suffering from cancer.
-Cancer?

1124
01:29:22,934 --> 01:29:25,813
Oh my God!
Then why are you here?

1125
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:29,374
You should be in some hospital.
-No, sir.

1126
01:29:30,042 --> 01:29:31,248
I'm an officer.

1127
01:29:32,845 --> 01:29:34,722
Instead of dying
on the hospital bed..

1128
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:37,458
..l want to meet
death while on fight.

1129
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:46,381
H.. h.. -She's saying
hello to you, sir.

1130
01:29:47,127 --> 01:29:49,698
Are there any outsiders
entered in the village?

1131
01:29:50,404 --> 01:29:52,782
No, sir.

1132
01:29:53,034 --> 01:29:56,846
If you see strangers whom
you don't know inform police.

1133
01:29:57,129 --> 01:29:59,605
She's asking you.. why?

1134
01:29:59,686 --> 01:30:01,324
They're the absconding
prisoners.

1135
01:30:04,934 --> 01:30:06,845
She keeps doing that, sir.

1136
01:30:06,967 --> 01:30:10,005
We'll inform you as soon as we
see a stranger in the village.

1137
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,104
Okay!
-Bye!

1138
01:30:17,009 --> 01:30:17,987
Bye! Bye!

1139
01:30:19,134 --> 01:30:20,977
Very nicely you fooled
the police officers.

1140
01:30:21,201 --> 01:30:23,807
Mister, we're
from drama company.

1141
01:30:23,967 --> 01:30:26,811
It's very easy for us.

1142
01:30:28,867 --> 01:30:30,244
I hope you're not
playing drama with me.

1143
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:31,388
With you?

1144
01:30:32,767 --> 01:30:35,111
No! Tell me something, mister.

1145
01:30:35,654 --> 01:30:39,625
Do you love me?
-Oh yes, we'll get married.

1146
01:30:40,212 --> 01:30:43,523
There's no life without
wife. You didn't get it?

1147
01:30:44,167 --> 01:30:46,010
We'll get married.

1148
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,237
What's more worrying is that..

1149
01:30:48,301 --> 01:30:52,545
"Villagers are fearless
about king Mangal Singh.

1150
01:30:52,934 --> 01:30:56,347
Entire Village is
helping Vijay and his men.

1151
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:57,945
That's why police
can't nab them.

1152
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,037
When we heard this,
we couldn't believe it.

1153
01:31:00,534 --> 01:31:02,878
People of Fatehgarh
were scared of you.

1154
01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:05,940
But how could they
dare raise head at you?

1155
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,239
We're proud of our
respective areas..

1156
01:31:08,401 --> 01:31:10,972
"because of your
power and name.

1157
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:16,287
When we raid a place, people
think it's Mangal Singh.

1158
01:31:16,382 --> 01:31:18,040
That's why nobody used
to argue or challenge us.

1159
01:31:18,201 --> 01:31:20,340
We served your father, Chief.

1160
01:31:20,547 --> 01:31:25,652
My brother Rajan and
I will die for you.

1161
01:31:25,896 --> 01:31:29,919
Order us, Mangal Singh.
We'll make them bent at you.

1162
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:33,985
Aye! We'll crush those heads.

1163
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:39,269
They'll be found dead
by tomorrow evening.

1164
01:31:39,834 --> 01:31:41,142
Lala!
-Yes, Chief.

1165
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:44,361
You inform the villagers
that few people are coming..

1166
01:31:44,634 --> 01:31:47,171
..with a marriage
proposal for your daughter.

1167
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:49,807
This way, we'll
enter the village.

1168
01:31:57,334 --> 01:32:02,511
And you'll cordon the
village with your men.

1169
01:32:02,834 --> 01:32:05,144
If they'd try to escape..

1170
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,537
..they'll have enemies
in front as well as back.

1171
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:14,150
Mangal Singh was born a
king and will remain a king.

1172
01:32:14,781 --> 01:32:15,725
Hello, Lala.

1173
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:18,464
I'm expecting few
people from Chamangarh..

1174
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:20,194
..with my daughter's
marriage proposal.

1175
01:32:20,367 --> 01:32:21,345
You people are also invited.

1176
01:32:21,467 --> 01:32:24,311
Fine, l'll take your leave.
l've to invite many others.

1177
01:32:24,745 --> 01:32:27,282
Why are you sad, my child?

1178
01:32:27,669 --> 01:32:31,116
I'll get you married this year.
-Papa..

1179
01:32:31,324 --> 01:32:32,928
Boy is really nice.

1180
01:32:33,537 --> 01:32:36,541
Sage!
-Don't you dare take his name!

1181
01:32:36,678 --> 01:32:40,649
I want to marry you
with Laxman from Rampur.

1182
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:41,880
He's a famous confectioner.

1183
01:32:42,006 --> 01:32:45,681
You'll get to eat many
varieties of sweets.

1184
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:48,464
Papa, I don't want to
eat sweets. -Shut up!

1185
01:32:48,577 --> 01:32:51,251
You must marry
a man of my choice.

1186
01:32:51,388 --> 01:32:52,264
Go back to the tent.

1187
01:32:52,357 --> 01:32:54,564
You go and get married. I won't.

1188
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:57,184
She doesn't listen
to her father.

1189
01:33:00,665 --> 01:33:03,631
My sweetheart.

1190
01:33:06,483 --> 01:33:09,191
Today, you've a chance.
Take the advantage.

1191
01:33:10,055 --> 01:33:12,934
Rupa! Why are you
crying, darling?

1192
01:33:13,038 --> 01:33:14,039
What's your concern?

1193
01:33:14,167 --> 01:33:16,807
I'm concern that's why l'm here.

1194
01:33:17,493 --> 01:33:20,804
Let go off my hand.
-lt's a strong grip.

1195
01:33:23,001 --> 01:33:24,275
Son of a..

1196
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,741

grip you can have.

1197
01:33:26,956 --> 01:33:30,995
Get away! -Don't you dare
held her hand again.

1198
01:33:31,086 --> 01:33:31,791
Is that clear?

1199
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,248
Why? Is she your sister?

1200
01:33:36,725 --> 01:33:38,830
Yes, she's my sister.
You too make her.

1201
01:33:39,001 --> 01:33:40,878
I'll catch her wrist.

1202
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,741
Are you fond of catching wrist?
-Yes.

1203
01:33:42,801 --> 01:33:44,781
Hold this.
-C'mon.

1204
01:33:44,867 --> 01:33:47,006
Not like this. Like this.

1205
01:34:28,367 --> 01:34:33,435
If anybody dare
act smart, we'd shoot.

1206
01:34:45,301 --> 01:34:46,279
Hey..

1207
01:34:47,142 --> 01:34:51,818
Won't you welcome the groom with
a procession in your village?

1208
01:34:53,734 --> 01:34:56,180
Everybody take off your belts.

1209
01:35:12,368 --> 01:35:21,186
Villagers, now watch
the drama l'd show you.

1210
01:35:23,662 --> 01:35:29,408
I'll put belt in your neck,
you government servant.

1211
01:35:34,163 --> 01:35:34,937
Get up!

1212
01:35:37,734 --> 01:35:41,045
Your men are so loyal, inspector.

1213
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:45,048
They're feeling your pain.

1214
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:50,082
If I wish I can crush
you to death now.

1215
01:35:50,496 --> 01:35:53,966
But I don't have
any enmity with you.

1216
01:35:54,427 --> 01:35:56,566
This inspector is my enemy.

1217
01:35:57,079 --> 01:35:59,821
He's my enemy and yours too.

1218
01:36:00,467 --> 01:36:01,411
You know what?

1219
01:36:01,534 --> 01:36:04,777
He provoked you and brought
you face to face to your death.

1220
01:36:05,823 --> 01:36:09,100
In short, Mangal
Singh's gun at one side..

1221
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:11,136
..and gallows on the other.

1222
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,213
I know you're brave. But
you're still a prisoner.

1223
01:36:13,795 --> 01:36:15,651
And I appreciate brave people
and want to see them free.

1224
01:36:16,022 --> 01:36:20,338
I can free you, if
you come into my camp.

1225
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:22,812
Accept me as your chief.

1226
01:36:24,267 --> 01:36:27,805
Whoever from you wants to
free, can come to my camp.

1227
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:32,595
Mangal Singh, I accept
you as my chief.

1228
01:36:34,547 --> 01:36:38,381
You're the only one
intelligent in them. C'mon.

1229
01:36:38,494 --> 01:36:40,337
But on one condition.

1230
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:50,513
I'll take away your sister.
-You cheap! You lowly!

1231
01:36:51,321 --> 01:36:52,299
Let go of me.

1232
01:36:52,573 --> 01:36:56,419
Nice girl! -Mangal Singh,
there's one more thing.

1233
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:58,639
Bring it.
-Take care of her.

1234
01:36:59,632 --> 01:37:00,610
Let go of!

1235
01:37:06,156 --> 01:37:09,283
Sir, what are you
doing? She's my daughter.

1236
01:37:09,433 --> 01:37:11,787
Why do you lie, Lala?

1237
01:37:12,173 --> 01:37:14,949
How could you have such
a beautiful daughter?

1238
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:19,418
Sir, she's my daughter.
Kill me but save my daughter.

1239
01:37:19,493 --> 01:37:22,406
Don't insult me. -Lala,
she'll remain your daughter.

1240
01:37:22,804 --> 01:37:24,647
But l'll make her my queen.

1241
01:37:24,813 --> 01:37:25,757
Take her away.

1242
01:37:26,314 --> 01:37:27,486
Oh! God!

1243
01:37:28,003 --> 01:37:31,746
I'll count till 10. Anybody
who's interested, can come.

1244
01:37:43,134 --> 01:37:44,340
1..

1245
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:54,870
2..

1246
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:01,645
3..

1247
01:38:11,467 --> 01:38:16,045
Chief! l'm with you.

1248
01:38:19,267 --> 01:38:23,613
Very good! One more intelligent.

1249
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:25,530
Come in!

1250
01:38:26,915 --> 01:38:27,950
4..

1251
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,778
5..

1252
01:38:32,301 --> 01:38:33,473
6..

1253
01:38:35,434 --> 01:38:36,412
7..

1254
01:38:39,867 --> 01:38:40,811
8..

1255
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,704
9..

1256
01:38:59,551 --> 01:39:00,859
Hail Lord!

1257
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,703
Child! Child!

1258
01:40:55,234 --> 01:40:57,145
Child, I hope you're
not injured.

1259
01:41:08,701 --> 01:41:11,181
Child! Child!

1260
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:13,545
Mother!

1261
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,344
Mother!

1262
01:41:24,132 --> 01:41:27,909
I've removed the bullet
but pulses are going down.

1263
01:41:28,842 --> 01:41:30,822
She lost much blood.

1264
01:41:31,839 --> 01:41:36,963
If blood isn't supplied on
time, it could risk her life.

1265
01:41:37,067 --> 01:41:40,412
Now don't waste time and take him
to the city as early as possible.

1266
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:41,244
To some hospital.

1267
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,533
C'mon, Bismillah,
let's arrange for a car.

1268
01:41:45,134 --> 01:41:47,136
Wait! You people don't go out.

1269
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:50,339
Mangal Singh's men have
cordoned the village.

1270
01:41:50,623 --> 01:41:53,433
How do you know? -l'm the
traitor in this village.

1271
01:41:53,836 --> 01:41:56,742
I used to give all information
about this village to Mangal.

1272
01:41:57,961 --> 01:42:01,306
But today his evil eyes
fell on my daughter..

1273
01:42:01,666 --> 01:42:05,045
..which opened my eyes.
Dacoits are never friends.

1274
01:42:05,664 --> 01:42:07,200
They're only dacoits.

1275
01:42:07,667 --> 01:42:10,113
Now you can punish me anything.

1276
01:42:10,567 --> 01:42:12,638
But you please don't go out.

1277
01:42:12,901 --> 01:42:14,972
He'll kill each of you.

1278
01:42:15,042 --> 01:42:19,115
Lala, for the first time,
we've got a mother in life.

1279
01:42:20,030 --> 01:42:23,409
We don't mind losing
life for her.

1280
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:25,973
We'll definitely
take away mother.

1281
01:42:28,873 --> 01:42:30,352
C'mon, Bismillah!

1282
01:42:35,787 --> 01:42:41,865
You've given this life,

1283
01:42:42,037 --> 01:42:48,349
We'll die for you.

1284
01:42:48,374 --> 01:42:54,489
There's nothing
in life without you.

1285
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:58,906
lt's useless living here.

1286
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:06,302
If anything happens
to you, mother.

1287
01:43:06,784 --> 01:43:12,427
We'll set the world on fire.

1288
01:43:16,834 --> 01:43:19,542
Mother is a mother..

1289
01:43:21,034 --> 01:43:23,844
Mother is a mother..

1290
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:32,449
There's no comparison
to a mother.

1291
01:43:57,934 --> 01:43:59,845
Don't worry, sir.
-Chase them.

1292
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,646
They shouldn't escape.
-Come with me.

1293
01:45:08,602 --> 01:45:11,549
Buggy shouldn't pass.
Explode it.

1294
01:46:33,614 --> 01:46:38,729
Every dog has a day!
Your game is over!

1295
01:46:39,471 --> 01:46:40,950
Throw your weapons!

1296
01:46:50,061 --> 01:46:51,233
Sher Singh!

1297
01:46:51,893 --> 01:46:53,107
I had heard..

1298
01:46:53,203 --> 01:46:55,467
That vulture flies to the
city when it's death is closer.

1299
01:46:56,097 --> 01:47:00,102
But why did they
come here to die?

1300
01:47:00,768 --> 01:47:03,514
Anyway, when they've
come, do something.

1301
01:47:03,612 --> 01:47:07,685
Tell me what's their
name and profession?

1302
01:47:07,915 --> 01:47:11,055
So that I can decide
their death accordingly.

1303
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:14,530
Mangal Singh, you've enmity
with us and not with our mother.

1304
01:47:15,385 --> 01:47:16,989
Mother will die if she isn't
reached to the hospital on time.

1305
01:47:17,195 --> 01:47:18,765
We promise you, Mangal Singh.

1306
01:47:19,454 --> 01:47:22,958
We'll come back after dropping
mother to the hospital.

1307
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:26,606
But sons have to
serve their mother.

1308
01:47:28,434 --> 01:47:32,678
So you'd pull the buggy and
l'll become the coachman.

1309
01:47:32,934 --> 01:47:34,811
But it'll pass from the village.

1310
01:47:34,934 --> 01:47:39,781
Okay? Shera! Inform the
villagers that l'm coming. Go!

1311
01:49:43,934 --> 01:49:45,572
Leave him, Raja!

1312
01:49:47,084 --> 01:49:49,030
He's my prey!

1313
01:49:52,068 --> 01:49:55,345
Vijay! Stop, Vijay! Don't shoot!

1314
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:00,802
Sir! Nobody can stop me today.

1315
01:50:01,177 --> 01:50:02,505
But it's against law!

1316
01:50:02,803 --> 01:50:06,337
Sir, he ruined my family.

1317
01:50:07,557 --> 01:50:10,385
I won't spare him alive.

1318
01:50:10,463 --> 01:50:13,572
By swear of the law you've
served all your life.

1319
01:50:13,968 --> 01:50:17,052
Hand over that man to me.

1320
01:50:18,228 --> 01:50:19,457
Drop your weapons.

1321
01:50:29,902 --> 01:50:31,136
Drop your weapons!

1322
01:51:18,553 --> 01:51:21,124
She's absolutely fine
now. You can take her away.

1323
01:51:26,007 --> 01:51:27,179
No..

1324
01:51:27,871 --> 01:51:30,909
You?!
-No, not me.

1325
01:51:31,186 --> 01:51:31,994
Stop!

1326
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:39,046
You.. -Nothing, government
telegram came in the office.

1327
01:51:39,153 --> 01:51:41,258
Your punishment is cancelled.

1328
01:51:46,534 --> 01:51:48,536
Mother is a mother..

1329
01:51:49,034 --> 01:51:51,173
Mother is a mother..

1330
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:55,315
There's no comparison to a mother.

1331
01:51:56,301 --> 01:52:00,426
Mother is a mother..

1332
01:52:01,129 --> 01:52:04,832
There's no comparison to a mother.
