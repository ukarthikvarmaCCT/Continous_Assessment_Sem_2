1
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:22,851
Welcome back to the vlog.

2
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,258
First of all we will have
tea and enjoy the view.

3
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:44,862
The lady is going down to the falls,

4
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:47,197
we will also go down
and have tea first.

5
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:49,152
So let's do one thing, let's go to the
falls, there are two ways to go the fall,

6
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:52,196
One goes down from here
and the other one goes ahead.

7
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,418
I have heard that the one
ahead is better, so let's go down.

8
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:03,847
Bro, I swear I didn't know
that Chhattisgarh is so beautiful.

9
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:07,322
I don't have words for
the winds and valleys here.

10
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:13,917
Oh, so we have to park
the car here and go down.

11
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:17,397
This is the nature's trail, there
is a way to go down from here.

12
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:20,155
They said that the water is too
much, so the way to go down is closed.

13
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,158
But let's try.

14
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,058
It seems to be a valuable thing from here.

15
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,594
Barricading has been done here
so that anyone does not go ahead.

16
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:30,553
Is it your duty here?

17
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,960
A few days ago, someone went inside here.

18
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:33,701
Does he comes from the village behind?

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,839
Yes, I saw it on TV.

20
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:35,713
He jumped from here,

21
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:36,398
Jumped from the front?

22
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,494
This girl jumped, but she survived.

23
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:39,791
The boat saved her.

24
00:01:40,318 --> 00:01:41,677
She knows how to swim.

25
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,937
If she knows how to swim,
maybe she wasn't save,

26
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:44,849
God saved her.

27
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:46,485
Have you come here
before, or this is the first time?

28
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,318
- First time..

29
00:01:47,343 --> 00:01:48,678
I really wanted to go boating,

30
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,363
Because I saw on the internet
that boating is done here.

31
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:51,546
They take to near that.

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,496
It is said that the fun of seeing is in the monsoon.

33
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:53,812
- Yes

34
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:54,912
And it changes color also.

35
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:57,193
Now there is a little muddy
water, it turns white in winter.

36
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
It brings a lot of soil on the way.

37
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:02,330
But it is said that
this soil is very fertile.

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,447
These kids gave me a challenge.

39
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:42,710
Bro, do one thing, hold the
drone in your hand and show me.

40
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:43,191
I said

41
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,090
Challenge accepted.

42
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:46,652
So now let's go down.

43
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:52,729
The sad thing is that I saw on YouTube
that they take you right next to the falls.

44
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,844
It is not possible in the monsoon.

45
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,923
You have to come back in winters.

46
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:55,984
This is the way to go down.

47
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:56,458
Let's go.

48
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,378
Look at that, people have reached below.

49
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:00,088
It is very beautiful.

50
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:01,970
This gate comes from our resort.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,458
And this is where we came from.

52
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,483
This is a little small, where we came from.

53
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:05,573
This is a long route?

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,286
- Yes

55
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,377
Jai Bholenath.

56
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:11,104
Let's visit, Bholenath.

57
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:12,422
It was Monday yesterday.

58
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:13,752
I couldn't go to the temple.

59
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:25,422
They are saying that the
water level is low here.

60
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:26,422
It will fall more in August.

61
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:28,957
The water level comes up to here.

62
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:29,526
- Yes

63
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,493
You are leaving today, right?

64
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,114
Yes in evening.

65
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:31,920
Okay, brother.

66
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:32,652
Take care.

67
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:41,014
I have come wrong way. there is no
way to go ahead. I have to go back.

68
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,941
It seems that the water has
come up to here from the soil.

69
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:44,995
It is the soil of the river.

70
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:47,351
We have read in our childhood
which is the alluvial soil.

71
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:48,384
It is very fertile.

72
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:49,287
Which is that soil? I forgot.

73
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,506
Where is the way to go?

74
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,861
How have people reached?

75
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,894
If I reach from here,
it seems i will reach.

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,260
It looks fine.

77
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:59,230
I found the way.

78
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:00,034
He has gone from here.

79
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,954
When you come here,
you will see light rain.

80
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,146
When the rain falls, it is
the water of the waterfall.

81
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,356
It stays like this in the whole atmosphere.

82
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:10,285
Now we have reached to our water.

83
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:12,546
Look at the view of
the waterfall from here.

84
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:13,713
Nice.

85
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,206
Ohh, I have to go.

86
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:23,772
Leave it.

87
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:24,540
I will go from ahead.

88
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,869
Bro, My curiosity is
forcing me to go ahead.

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,436
Those people have left in front of me.

90
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:42,939
It seems that people are
having a lot of fun laughing there.

91
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:44,207
We should also have fun.

92
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:45,981
Found it.

93
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:48,710
I have reached, here it is that people.

94
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:49,557
They are doing camping.

95
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:49,953
Nice.

96
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:51,198
Here it is.

97
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,029
This black-black hut.

98
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,061
This is our hut.

99
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:56,817
We went from
there in the morning.

100
00:04:58,225 --> 00:04:58,593
This

101
00:04:58,825 --> 00:04:59,618
This People met us.

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,336
Look at this.

103
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,072
People are still standing.

104
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:01,930
This is the picture point.

105
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:04,160
We came from there.

106
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,969
And then we came down here.

107
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:07,797
I think it's done.

108
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:09,033
That's all there was
to see in the waterfall.

109
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:09,993
It's 9 o'clock now.

110
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,890
Checkout is at 11 o'clock.

111
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,365
What am I doing tomorrow after this?

112
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,292
I have no idea.

113
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:14,635
I had just planned this.

114
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,138
But I know that I have to
spend another day around it.

115
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:18,100
So let's see what it is.

116
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:18,718
Then we will go.

117
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:19,458
There are stairs.

118
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,565
But I always feel that
before climbing the stairs,

119
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,589
 I should see it for the last time.

120
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,889
But as soon as I see it,

121
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:26,954
I feel that thousands and millions of tons
of water fall from this fall every second.

122
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,841
Man can't even think of making
something like this man-made.

123
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:31,099
Only he can do it.

124
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:32,569
The ultimate creator.

125
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:35,111
After leaving the hustle
and bustle of the city.

126
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,065
And coming here in the arms of nature.

127
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,205
I don't feel like going
back to the city at all.

128
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:42,901
If you listen carefully,
nature says a lot to you.

129
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,571
It's such a beautiful waterfall
you should definitely come here.

130
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,306
But one thing makes me sad to see here.

131
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:48,288
Everything is good it is.

132
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:49,910
It is called India's best waterfall.

133
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,278
It is called India's Niagara Falls.

134
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:52,422
But look at the people.

135
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:53,422
There are only a few people.

136
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:55,566
And as far as I talked,
everyone here is local.

137
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:59,422
If you go to the airport, there
is so much tourism promoted.

138
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:00,540
There are so many big hoardings.

139
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:01,709
It is also at Delhi Airport.

140
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:02,736
It is also at Raipur Airport.

141
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,326
But when you come on location,

142
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:06,911
The facilities are less
according to the number of ads.

143
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:08,422
If you look at Niagara Falls.

144
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:11,009
The entire economy of Niagara
City goes from where to where.

145
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:12,630
They have made so much there.

146
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:14,297
Hotel, restaurant, casino.

147
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,062
Just people will come to see the waterfall.

148
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:17,087
If people have come here.

149
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:19,300
If now I have to drink tea and coffee here.

150
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:22,052
I will drink tea and coffee
here and spend 300-400 rupees.

151
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:23,284
It will take in the economy here.

152
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,005
But there is nothing.

153
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,096
So if you want to promote tourism,
you have to do development here.

154
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:45,429
How old is this temple? 100 years old.

155
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:46,246
- 100 years

156
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,051
 100 years old.

157
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:48,969
The stone and statue look very old.

158
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,813
The building of the temple is not that old.

159
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:53,914
And this stone looks very old.

160
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:55,737
Can I sit here for a while?

161
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:59,244
I felt such a new energy inside the temple.

162
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:03,086
I decided to sit with Lord
Shiva for half an hour.

163
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,111
Although I was getting late.

164
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:06,824
But Lord Shiva made me sit there.

165
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,929
Look at our Nandi Maharaj
looking at his Lord Shiva.

166
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:11,370
But there is something in this.

167
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,496
As soon as I took off my
shoes at the temple and

168
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:15,308
 put my bare feet on the marble.

169
00:07:15,397 --> 00:07:16,397
I felt a strange feeling.

170
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:17,266
I felt very good.

171
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:18,661
My check-out is at 11 o'clock.

172
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:20,222
It is 10.30 am already here.

173
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:22,882
There is no smell.

174
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:23,545
Can you smell it?

175
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,373
No.

176
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:25,673
There is no smell.

177
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:29,892
I don't know what kind of incense it is.

178
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,814
I don't feel like saying bye to it.

179
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,745
But a final bye.

180
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,476
The work is going on.

181
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:37,288
If they are making it,
they should  make it good.

182
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:38,092
But look here.

183
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:39,800
There is a tea shop for tourists.

184
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:40,354
This one.

185
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,953
This is the market to eat and drink.

186
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,304
What a good opportunity.

187
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,010
If we invest here and we will make good.

188
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:47,452
How big a tourist this place can be.

189
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,392
And how much revenue
can be generated from here.

190
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:50,669
I feel like thinking.

191
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:51,838
We don't have that thinking.

192
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,060
We don't have that thought.

193
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,342
How to make it big.

194
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:57,078
In foreign countries they
don't have tourist places.

195
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,436
They construct it first.

196
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:00,132
They will construct it and develop it.

197
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,284
Then tourism in it.

198
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:02,842
It takes so much time for
them to make a break-even.

199
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,289
Nature has given us tourist places.

200
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,605
We have to build infrastructure around it.

201
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:08,489
We are behind in that too.

202
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:19,348
Bro, I am Super late.

203
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:20,422
And now I am moving ahead.

204
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:22,422
206 was supposed to come, got it wrong.

205
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:23,422
That one.

206
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:24,562
there are so much ants here.

207
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:26,876
Finally.

208
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:27,676
No matter how late it is.

209
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:29,397
We have to transfer a cup of tea and data.

210
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:30,284
Because I don't have space.

211
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,357
I have to charge the battery.

212
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:33,063
I was about to check out from the room.

213
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,565
That's when I got a very bad news.

214
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:36,705
Is the water full there?

215
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,422
Yes, water is full.

216
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:38,770
Hello.

217
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:40,397
Bro, I am in trouble.

218
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:40,926
What happened?

219
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:42,951
You told me to go to the falls.

220
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:43,876
Chitrakote Falls.

221
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:44,222
Yes.

222
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:45,845
Then you told me to go to the cave.

223
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,240
Yes.

224
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:48,158
The cave is closed in monsoon.

225
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:49,138
Oh.

226
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:50,625
I didn't know about the rain.

227
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,920
It is closed in monsoon.

228
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,773
So there is nothing else to do here.

229
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,228
There is nothing left.

230
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:56,397
There are temples there.

231
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:57,160
Can you go there?

232
00:08:57,422 --> 00:08:58,200
What is the name of the temple?

233
00:08:58,813 --> 00:08:59,672
Danteshwari.

234
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:00,582
Danteshwari Temple.

235
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:02,397
Let's say goodbye to the falls.

236
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:03,304
One last time.

237
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:04,171
Bye.

238
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:05,366
It's a very beautiful place.

239
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,380
But there is one thing.

240
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,542
If you come in the
monsoon, it is very beautiful.

241
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:09,469
It will be fun to watch.

242
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:10,422
But you won't be able to go boating.

243
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:11,578
But if you come in the winter.

244
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,656
November, December, January.

245
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:13,422
Then you can go boating.

246
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:14,422
And I saw it on YouTube.

247
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:15,422
Where the water is falling.

248
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,422
You go near it.

249
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,422
And people are like this.

250
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:18,246
How far is it?

251
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,060
I wanted that experience,
I couldn't get it Next time.

252
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
We are checking out from here.

253
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,993
But I have some trouble here.

254
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,279
Yesterday I was in
trouble and today too.

255
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:26,753
And that's just because of one person.

256
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:27,786
He is following me.

257
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:29,617
I don't have anything
to eat and give him.

258
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:30,481
I don't have anything.

259
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:33,367
So the thing is that there is nothing to do here.

260
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:34,286
Caves are closed.

261
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,001
So I am thinking.

262
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:35,477
To leave from here.

263
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:36,702
I will have to stop in Raipur.

264
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:37,712
So, I will stop somewhere.

265
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:38,756
Or I will see the night at flight.

266
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:39,666
I will shoot there.

267
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:40,466
Let's go.

268
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,224
Amcho Deva Homestay.

269
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,066
But let's see, how are homestays is.

270
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,565
Let's ask here, I can't see anyone where.

271
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:46,140
Sister.

272
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,419
Is this the homestay board outside?

273
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:49,096
Is it the one in front?

274
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:49,633
Okay.

275
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:50,309
It's this one.

276
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:51,768
Brother, look at the door.

277
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:52,610
Empty.

278
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:56,921
I have Checked out the room.

279
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:57,628
It was nothing special.

280
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:58,145
It was a simple room.

281
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,924
I thought, these houses,

282
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:03,673
 like people live in this
house if i got a room to live with them ,

283
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:05,311
Then you will definitely
get to know their life.

284
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:09,337
I like the food that is prepared in the kitchen
of the local people, the kind of food they eat.

285
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,375
They sleep the same way,
how they fill water in the morning.

286
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,588
To see such a life, but
this was a normal room.

287
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,062
Come on, let's go back to Raipur.

288
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:25,690
This is the rental car, they gave me fuel just like one stick,

289
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:26,357
Now there are two sticks.

290
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:28,632
So I have to fill so much
petrol that when I reach Raipur,

291
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:31,224
I have to return it in one stick,
otherwise I will suffer a loss.

292
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,716
They are making money with this
engineering, we can study how it works.

293
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:36,181
I stopped here to get a bottle of water.

294
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,072
This is the way to Raipur and this is the straight way to Chitrakoot.

295
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,809
So thank you Chitrakoot,
I liked it very much.

296
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:41,921
It was a very beautiful waterfall.

297
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:45,383
For Caves I have to visit again
because it is the largest cave in Asia.

298
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:47,465
And it is said that the sunlight
does not even go down.

299
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,488
There are such fish in the water that
they have not even seen the sunlight.

300
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:52,234
So I feel like going down there.

301
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,925
There is so much treasure in Chhattisgarh.

302
00:10:53,977 --> 00:10:57,582
If we promote tourism here,
then a lot of tourists will come here.

303
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:58,609
Thank you so much for watching this vlog.

304
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:00,314
Take care of yourself, we
will meet you in the next vlog,

305
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:00,569
Bye.

306
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,081
I have a tease of Vlogging.

307
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:12,213
We complete these 6-6 hours in 8-8.9 hours.

308
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:14,846
And all our places, yesterday we
missed the waterfall cause of this.

309
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,293
Today I didn't even miss the
flight of Raipur.

310
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:18,274
Have to go to Raipur.

311
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,408
