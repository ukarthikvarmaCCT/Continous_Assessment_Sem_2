1
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,560
If the current MLA passed away,
the chief minister should be here.

2
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,880
Instead, why is
the home minister coming here?

3
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,280
Is the chief minister really busy
or does he not need us anymore?

4
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,960
Nothing of that sort, Rajan.

5
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,280
There is an urgent meeting,
otherwise he would have come.

6
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,360
The death of your father has not
left your family but even...

7
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,920
the party with an irreplaceable.

8
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,840
Don't worry about it.

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,680
The party will support you.

10
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,880
Whether you want to
do some business...

11
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,920
or take up government contracts,
it's your wish.

12
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,440
If you want something, ask for it.

13
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,760
When are the by-elections?

14
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,400
Because of untimely death of
Narender, there will be by-election.

15
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,360
Narender's son Rajan desires to
contest those elections...

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,360
as a candidate of our party.

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,760
Will you make deceased MLA's
children and widows the next MLA?

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
What about those party workers...

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,920
who worked hard for
the party for years.

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,320
The people there are not mourning
the loss of Narender.

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Everyone is celebrating the death.
- Yes, she is right.

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,560
Because of political backing
of his father...

23
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,880
Rajan committed atrocities.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,840
we will most definitely not get even
a single vote in our favour.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,440
Though Mr Rajan from Macharla is
not from any political party...

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,800
he is a leader who has close
ties with the people there.

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,360
If he were to be given
the candidature...

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,960
we will surely win that seat
and even the party will rise...

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,720
Please give him your endorsement
for candidature.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
This CM is a piece of work.

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,560
If it was good news,
he would deliver it himself.

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,720
If it was bad news, he would
order us to be its bearers.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,720
Rajan, the party has
met to decide...

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,720
who to endorse as their candidate...

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
for the upcoming by-elections.

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,160
I insisted that you be given
the candidature.

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,320
the party decided that this time...

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
Raghavendra be given
the candidature.

39
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,600
CM has recommended his name,
so now we can't do anything.

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
We have to obey the party.

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,880
Minister, after my father
passed away...

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,480
did you guys change
the rules within the ruling party?

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,040
You said what you had to say.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,240
I heard it.

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
I will do what is required of me.

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,480
Watch me.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Long live Raghu Pratap Singh!

48
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,880
Long live Raghu Pratap Singh!

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,160
We thank you all for coming out
after all these days...

50
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,720
and showing us your support.

51
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,720
Even when I didn't have any
authority, I was always with you.

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,280
I will always be with you for sure.

53
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,840
But given the political
scenario of today...

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,800
you don't need a tortoise like me.

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,360
You need some young
and relentless helmsman.

56
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,320
That is the reason why...

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,320
I recommend my son
Surya in my stead.

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,960
Brother Surya, long live!

59
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,320
Brother Surya, long live!

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,160
Brother Surya, long live!

61
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,800
Come out.

62
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,440
Hey! Don't spare them.

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,480
How dare you!

64
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Don't spare him.

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,160
Let's go.

66
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,400
Come on. Run!

67
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,120
Did you think that
after my father's death...

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,280
his kingdom would be yours?

69
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,280
Did you not think that this Rajan
exists or did you forget about it?

70
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,720
If you are given a ticket...

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
you should go to the theatre
and watch the movie.

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,560
But why would you contest
the elections?

73
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,080
The sun that you desperately wished
would shine his light on you...

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,000
It has set, even before its rise.

75
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
If anyone of you cast vote...

76
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,160
your corpse will be
next to his corpse.

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,960
From now on, Macharla will
no longer have elections.

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Polling will no longer take place.

79
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,200
Rajan will rule here.

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,120
Hey, stop.

81
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,400
Nidhi, please stop.

82
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,280
Nidhi, stop.

83
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,520
Where are you going? Nidhi.

84
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
Hey, no. Please.

85
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,000
Siddhu first, then your turn...

86
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,680
Please... - Hey,
no one smeared you yet?

87
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,440
Shall I do it?
- Who are you?

88
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,560
Lovers does not need introductions,
honey.

89
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,800
A beauty will always
attract the youth.

90
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,840
Women look much more beautiful...

91
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,400
in wet clothes rather
than in skimpy outfits.

92
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,200
Nidhi, come here.

93
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,440
Wow! Just like her name,
her body looks like a jewel.

94
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,880
I want to rob it.

95
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
You are crossing your limits.
- Oh!

96
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,920
Siddhu!

97
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Who is he? Your bodyguard?

98
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,480
No, her boyfriend.
- Oh!

99
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,600
A hero, huh?

100
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,320
It's going to be
a little bland if you call for him.

101
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,840
Let him come. We will crush him.

102
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,080
Siddhu?

103
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,920
Siddhu, dear?

104
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,960
Usually, when you mess with me,
I deal with you my way.

105
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,320
But if you mess with women...

106
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,960
This... this is how it looks.

107
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,680
You are going overboard.

108
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,040
Yes, I am.

109
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,040
I have extra power in me.

110
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,800
I don't use battery for extra power.

111
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,440
I have the guts.

112
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,200
I realise my responsibility.

113
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,960
I have a different level.

114
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,480
He thinks he is a hero.

115
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,280
It would be better if we make up our
minds to be the villains here.

116
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,920
It's a modern times films.

117
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
At times, the villains win too.

118
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,920
Bro... bro,
please let us go. I get it.

119
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,120
No matter what happens, at the end
of the day, only the hero wins.

120
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
Eve teasing is not good for health.

121
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,240
Warning.

122
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,200
What will you do if
a girl wants that?

123
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,880
Nobody can't argue with you.

124
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,240
Please spare me. Let's go.

125
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,840
People call me Guru.

126
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,280
Sorry, sir.

127
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,400
Won't you put the captions?

128
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,200
I will write what you are.

129
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,760
Check your right side, sir.

130
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,120
The father of ego.

131
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,320
This title is good. I like it.

132
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,280
I am coming.

133
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,400
Oh, it's you?

134
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,600
You are already here. Come.

135
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Why do you look like you entered
the neighbour's house?

136
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,320
It's our house, isn't it? Come in.

137
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,360
Goodness! Looks like
his ego is hurt.

138
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,280
Wow! You are really looking great.

139
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,120
Even on the day of Holi...

140
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,600
you look so spotless
and shiny like the people...

141
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,240
in the ads of washing powder.

142
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,680
You are super!

143
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,960
How did you manage to do this?

144
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,960
How?

145
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,600
I will bite you.

146
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,160
Doesn't matter if it's
a collector or even some colour...

147
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,440
they must bow down to my ego.

148
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,720
Didn't I tell you that...

149
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
I would return without a single
drop of colour falling on me?

150
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
Not even single drop...

151
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,200
Thank goodness.
All of it fell down, otherwise...

152
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,240
You jerk!
- Father! Father!

153
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
If anyone hits,
they call out for their mother.

154
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,240
How come you are calling out
for your father?

155
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,160
Who is your father?

156
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,560
Tell me the name your father?
- Leave him.

157
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,440
Call him here.
- It's you!

158
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,120
This is our Bunty.

159
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,040
So, what if he is Bunty or a bell?
! Stupid faced woman!

160
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Today I must find out
who his parents is!

161
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Tell me!
- Stop it.

162
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,280
He is really our son.

163
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,440
Here, see this.

164
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,560
"Father is my God."

165
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,120
Where is your Tattoo?
- Here.

166
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,640
"My husband is my God."

167
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,800
Sorry, darling.

168
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,800
Why do you stink?!

169
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,160
Brother Siddhu broke
an egg on my cloths, father.

170
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,520
Couldn't you have sat on the stove?

171
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,920
It would have turned into an omelet!

172
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,640
These days Siddhu has turned
even more crazy.

173
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,760
I will not spare him.
I will crack an eggs on his head.

174
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,720
I will crack his ego.
- Please, don't.

175
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,120
You come with me!
Where are you coming?

176
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,640
You come with me!
- Listen to me...

177
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,000
Hi!
- Your legs might break off.

178
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,960
Is this the way you raise your son?

179
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,720
What are you talking about?

180
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,880
I am in no way related to him.

181
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,240
How can this fatty be my son?

182
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
I am not talking about my son.
I am talking about that jerk!

183
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,560
His size and
his mischief are on the rise.

184
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,720
Siddhu broke an egg
in my son's underwear! - My son?

185
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,040
How do I explain?

186
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Outside the house,
he roams around with girls.

187
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,680
And at home,
he kills time with little kids...

188
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,480
Eat up, dear.
- This one here...

189
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,400
as soon as it's morning,
he lounges around the house!

190
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,440
If your son crosses the limits,
I will lose my control.

191
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,840
I will deal with him.

192
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,760
Bye, aunty
- Bye, dear.

193
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,320
Oh!

194
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,720
The girl came out of
his room. Right?

195
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,880
There is neither decency
or cultured behaviour.

196
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,440
Do I have to learn manners
and decency from you?

197
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,600
Who else would be more decent?
Talk sense into her.

198
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,880
Hey, man. What's up?

199
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,680
Oh God!
- Bye Siddhu.

200
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,960
Bye, aunty.
- Bye.

201
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
See you.
- Bye.

202
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,560
Just because the government banned
those websites...

203
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,440
this man started to get
indecent right at home.

204
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,160
Forget about making them understand.
Get them both married!

205
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,880
Green T
- Shirt and black pant.

206
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,440
Doesn't look good on old age.

207
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,120
Wear 'Dhoti and kurta'. (Indian
dress) - Let's go!

208
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,600
This is not your age to watch
adult stuff. - Let's go!

209
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Does this old man need a colourful
T - shirt? - Drat.

210
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,040
If I see him ever again,
I will murder him.

211
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,680
Did you see that?

212
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,160
Even that jerk is teaching us
some lessons!

213
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,400
What exactly is
your problem in marrying that girl?

214
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,880
She is okay with it, her family
and even we are okay with it.

215
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,000
Then what is your problem?

216
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,720
Father, she is my childhood friend.

217
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,840
I have no such feelings towards her.

218
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,280
She is my best friend.

219
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,280
That's all.

220
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,440
What's going on with him?

221
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,840
A wife is said to be
a man's best friend.

222
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,480
When will he understand?

223
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,400
Why would he do something that
the both of us ask him to?

224
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,520
He does what he feels is best.

225
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,440
I am already here.
Why didn't you come?

226
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,880
I'll call you later...

227
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,680
Brother, please stop it. Brother!

228
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,200
Catch it.

229
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
Thank you, Brother.
- Be careful.

230
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,440
Hello? Excuse me.
- Okay...

231
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,760
You forgot your drawing book.

232
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,160
Your book.

233
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Oh? Sorry.

234
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Thank you so much.

235
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,840
Do you really like me that much?

236
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,400
What do you mean?

237
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,840
Then, why did you draw my picture?

238
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,920
Oh, this?

239
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,000
Sketching portraits is my hobby.

240
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,960
Doesn't that mean you like me?

241
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,840
Hello? You are reading way too
much meaning into this.

242
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,280
I just drew it on a whim.

243
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Don't cling to me now.

244
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,280
Oh?

245
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,240
If you didn't like me,
why did you hug me? - Tell me.

246
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,520
Hug?

247
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,320
What do you mean I hugged you?

248
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,760
Don't be smart.

249
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,960
I am always smart.

250
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,600
You drew me in a book.

251
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,080
But I printed your picture here...
right here.

252
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,400
You have disturbed me.

253
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,520
What's going on?

254
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,040
Why are you talking without
making any sense?

255
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,640
As soon as I looked at you,
I have gone crazy.

256
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,520
And all my senses stopped working.

257
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,280
I like you a lot.
I am fixated on you.

258
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,760
Be my life partner.
Let's fix the wedding date.

259
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,000
This is too much.

260
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,400
Let's do this.

261
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,680
If you like me,
leave from here quietly.

262
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,080
If you don't like me, give me
your address before you leave.

263
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
Drat!

264
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,120
Since you are leaving,
that means you do like me.

265
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,600
No matter where you live,
I will find you.

266
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,920
Within a span of two days,
I will catch you.

267
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,200
I will be in front of you,
when you will open the window.

268
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,320
Bye.

269
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,040
Bunty, today,
the ocean looks quite different.

270
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,200
You seem different too.
- Why do you say that?

271
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,800
You brought me here at night
and bought my favourite roll.

272
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,040
What's going on?

273
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,160
A miraculous thing happened to me.

274
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,360
What is it? Nidhi left you?
- No.

275
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,040
There is a new person
in my life now.

276
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,280
Is that why
your face seems to glow? - Yes.

277
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,520
The girl of my dreams appeared
in front of me.

278
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,960
Really? Where is she?

279
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,680
She is here in this city.
But I don't know where she is.

280
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,120
We need to search for her
and find her out.

281
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,120
Brother, you know of alleys even
the Google doesn't know about.

282
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,040
If you are determined,
it's an easy job for you.

283
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,560
Such a golden boy you are!

284
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,800
Cheers!
- Cheers!

285
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,440
'Wherever you are, I am going to
find you. Within two days. '

286
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,280
My egoistic brother-in-law!

287
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,520
Brother-in-law...
what brings you by like this?

288
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,480
Like this?

289
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,040
Fine, give me some women's clothes.

290
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,840
I'll wear them and come to
meet you. - Disgusting!

291
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,960
As if I would really wear something
like that. Move!

292
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,120
Well, brother-in-law, I meant...
- Hold on.

293
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,960
You came to my city
and instead of staying with me...

294
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
you choose to stay here.

295
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,360
Brother-in-law,
I am quite safe here.

296
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,280
Really?

297
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,680
If you roam around the beaches with
that beautiful face of yours...

298
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,360
will the young men let
you be in peace?

299
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,600
Looks like someone is deeply
thinking of you.

300
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,520
Have some water, my son.

301
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,480
It must be the beauty that
I saw on the beach.

302
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,480
I know.

303
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,640
Self
- respect.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,280
If your self - respect weighs in
kilos, my ego measures in quintals.

305
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,280
Pack your bags.

306
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,800
Please, brother-in-law.

307
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,160
"Please, brother-in-law."

308
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,480
Select a font for the tattoo...

309
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,840
that says "My brother-in-law
is my God."

310
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,760
Who's the tattoo for?

311
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,960
Who else? It's for you.

312
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,920
At least with that tattoo,
people will stay away from you.

313
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,440
Forget about the tattoo,
brother-in-law. Let's just go home.

314
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,960
What happened to your self
- respect now?

315
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,960
Pack your bags!

316
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,880
A door has no stature.

317
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,800
I will open with my hands
and shut it with my leg.

318
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,160
Damn it!

319
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,640
I was going
in search of that girl...

320
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
Instead, I ran into
this egoistic fellow!

321
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,520
What do I do? If he sees me...

322
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,720
I will neither get
the girl nor her address.

323
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,920
I should better leave.

324
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,760
Swati.

325
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,320
Are you well?
- How are you?

326
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,320
I am fine.

327
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,240
Hi, Bunty.
- Hello, sister.

328
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,600
How are our parents?

329
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,520
Everyone is doing well.

330
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,360
Just go on up the stairs.
I'll get you some coffee.

331
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,040
Alright.
- Bunty, come here.

332
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
What are you doing here?

333
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,160
Exactly my question.
What are you doing here?

334
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,040
This is my brother-in-law's
house. - Oh?

335
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,960
Are you really going to use...

336
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,120
that excuse to come to
my neighbor's house.

337
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,320
You didn't let me savour
the experience to find you.

338
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,880
Drat. I am left with no
memories for old age.

339
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,680
Couldn't you have waited
for two more days?

340
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,720
Do you really like me so much?

341
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,600
Hello? Hello?

342
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,960
Why are you rushing forward like
a train on a single track?!

343
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,920
Alright, fine.

344
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,840
Since we are together, it doesn't
matter who made the first move.

345
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,400
Now I understand
how much love you have for me.

346
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,320
How naughty.

347
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,640
Couldn't you have confessed
your feelings...

348
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,280
for me yesterday itself on
the beach? - What?

349
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
Don't worry at all.

350
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,760
I will never tell anyone
that you came here for me.

351
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,120
Well, your brother-in-law is
an egotistical fellow.

352
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,000
I will try to manage
the situation somehow.

353
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,240
Will meet each other every
day in secret...

354
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,200
We will chat lovingly.
Its going to be fun.

355
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,280
Ok?

356
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,400
Hi.
- Hi, Guru.

357
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,400
Hey.

358
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Coming from up there?

359
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,520
Having the airport so close to
one's house is such a bother!

360
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,480
Paragliding.

361
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,520
Oh, you landed in
the wrong place, huh?

362
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,040
Paragliding isn't done here.
It's in Ooty.

363
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,720
Man, you aren't as foolish
as you look.

364
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Well, my ego is satisfied. But my
logic is still not satisfied.

365
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,440
Why did you come from up there?

366
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,760
Guru, I am your neighbour.

367
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,800
How does it matter where
I come from?

368
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,560
If you are a neighbour, you should
come from the main gate.

369
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,680
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

370
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,400
You held me by my collar, right?
- Yes, very tightly!

371
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,840
I will stay here.
I will not go home.

372
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,000
My ego is hurt!

373
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,400
You have an ego too?
- Yes.

374
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,160
Ego is like a BMW car.

375
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,800
It's easy to buy one
but it's exhausting to maintain it!

376
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,560
Your ego is nothing
compared to mine.

377
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Get out from here.

378
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
Do you want to compete with me?

379
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, it's you.

380
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,880
What happened?
Why aren't you picking up my call?

381
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
How many times should I call you?

382
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,480
Get in the car.

383
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,640
Were you worried
that someone kidnapped me?

384
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,920
It doesn't matter
if you are kidnapped.

385
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,520
I am tensed just looking at you.
What will people think?

386
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
What will they think?

387
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,720
They will simply think
it's romance before our wedding.

388
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,160
Try behaving like
a girl for a bit at least.

389
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,120
Please.

390
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,920
Why? Should boys be
the only ones to bring up romance?

391
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,560
Shouldn't women talk about it?

392
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,200
Where are you taking me?

393
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,240
Today, my father is at home.

394
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
He wants to meet you.

395
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,520
Oh?

396
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,480
Daughter and father will bring up
the topic of a marriage.

397
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,720
No. Just casual meeting.

398
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,760
I will not force you
if you don't like it.

399
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,560
Despite that,
I will never let you go.

400
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,280
Hi, daddy.
- Hi, dear.

401
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,400
Hi, uncle.
- Hi, Siddhu. How are you?

402
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,880
I am fine, uncle. How are you?

403
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Since I am a politician...

404
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,960
I spend a lot more time on
the streets rather than at home.

405
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,600
Now, I come to my very
own home as a guest.

406
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,160
Siddhu.

407
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,240
Please ask your parents to meet me.

408
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,520
Okay, uncle. But, well...

409
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,920
Daddy, we will talk later...

410
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,960
Come.

411
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,680
Bye
- Bye, dear.

412
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,040
Sir, who is that boy?

413
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,800
If everything works out,
he will become my son-in-law.

414
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,840
What does he do?

415
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,200
He is a topper in
the civil services examination.

416
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,120
He finished all the necessary
training. He's waiting to be posted.

417
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,160
What about your daughter?

418
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,040
He is totally crazy.

419
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,360
While she continued to flirt with
him and failed the examinations.

420
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,920
Hi, aunty.
- Hi, dear.

421
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
What is it, mother?

422
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Looks like you are singing
my praises to your friend.

423
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,200
I do want to show off.

424
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,840
When Siddhu will become
my son-in-law...

425
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,800
I will show off to
the entire world around.

426
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,880
He isn't the kind to agree to things
just because I like him...

427
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,240
and you wish for him
to be your son...

428
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,600
He does something only
if he likes it.

429
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,960
But once he likes something...

430
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,000
even if we persuade him to let it
go, he will never let it go.

431
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,480
That is the reason why...

432
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,480
I am trying to mould myself
according to his tastes.

433
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,320
Hello?

434
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,760
What's up? Didn't you eat?

435
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,560
Why are you devouring that book?

436
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,280
Goodness.

437
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,320
Is my life story printed
in the book?

438
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,440
I am reading how to deal with
insolent neighbours.

439
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,560
What is this, Swati?
We are neighbors.

440
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,600
We should be harmonious when
we are beside each other.

441
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,960
Don't make this wall
a border between us.

442
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,040
I didn't understand a word you said.

443
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,400
I didn't say a word.

444
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,680
I am speaking with my mouth whereas
you are speaking with your eyes.

445
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,240
I can't see properly
because you are too far.

446
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,160
Shall I come closer?

447
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,400
Are you always up to such nonsense?

448
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,400
Don't you have anything
better to do?

449
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,280
Hello?

450
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,280
I am an IAS officer.
- IAS.

451
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,320
Yeah, I know.
You are smarter then everyone.

452
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,280
No. It means I and Swati.

453
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,160
Can I come there?

454
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,400
If you come here, I will shout.

455
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,960
Go ahead and shout. Let me watch.

456
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,480
Hey!

457
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,200
What the hell?

458
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,240
I will scream.

459
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,600
Let's see you scream.

460
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,280
Stop there.

461
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,640
Or else...
- Scream.

462
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,560
Brother-in-law!

463
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,920
Did you climb up with a ladder?

464
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,720
Couldn't you have landed with
your paragliding?

465
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,040
Right from
the start of the morning...

466
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,240
that old man keeps talking
about manners and culture.

467
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
And the son is Jumping
the fence is manners, huh?

468
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,240
As soon as you see women,
you are going around like a bull?

469
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,560
How can an innocent woman like you
survive amongst such lustful men?

470
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,000
I brought her home to keep her
safe from the cruel world.

471
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,520
Where as you come into the house
and started flirt with her.

472
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,040
People like you shouldn't
be let scot-free.

473
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,160
You should be hanged
at the village square.

474
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,920
If you will shout,
your brother-in-law's...

475
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,160
reaction is going to
soil my character.

476
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
There's really nothing
new to be soiled here.

477
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,600
What does that mean?
I am a rotten person?

478
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,560
If that's the case,
I will really come there.

479
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,760
If that's the case,
I will scream for sure.

480
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,800
I will see if that happens.

481
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,840
Hey, this isn't right.

482
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,320
If anyone catches us,
it's going to look really bad.

483
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
You mean it's okay
if no one sees us?

484
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,520
Didn't you come for me?

485
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,920
Now that I want to come there
for you, why you are doing drama?

486
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,720
Brother-in-law.

487
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,440
Swati!

488
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,360
What is this?

489
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,080
I saved her the d beasts
and brought her here.

490
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,240
Now you have started right here.

491
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,440
I assumed you were innocent.

492
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,760
Though you've covered yourself
up completely...

493
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,360
you seem more dangerous than
those dressed in skimpy clothes.

494
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,280
It's because of girls like you...

495
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,960
who end up raising men'
temperatures...

496
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,960
and keep saying
that they are handsome...

497
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,560
and finally ruin their manhood.

498
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,720
What do I tell your parents?

499
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,440
What about the honor of my house?
Disgusting!

500
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,640
How much longer are you
going to keep dreaming.

501
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,440
If you do that,
your character will be ruined.

502
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,560
To ensure that neither of us
ruin our reputations...

503
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,120
it's best you stay right there.

504
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,240
You stop reading that book
and take some rest.

505
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,280
I will plan for our next meeting.

506
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,160
Okay? Good night. Bye.

507
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,200
How do I get rid of him!

508
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,880
Come on.

509
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,600
Catch it. Oh no!

510
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
We lost the match of 30 thousand!

511
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,120
Dear, did you lose again?
Did you lose the money?

512
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
I bet on a losing horse.

513
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,720
Still I won.

514
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,360
Well, would you buy me a new phone?

515
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,640
Did I ever break a promise?

516
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,120
This added expense.

517
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,040
Thinking of expenses,
we need to pay Bunty's school fees.

518
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,120
Where is Bunty?
He is at our neighbor's place.

519
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
If that's the case, ask
the neighbors to pay the fees.

520
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,480
Why will the neighbor's pay
our child's school fees?

521
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,600
I mean...

522
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,160
Why would the neighbors be willing
to pay our child's school fees?

523
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,160
Yes, it's our child.

524
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,200
Even though
he was born in this house...

525
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,440
he grew up entirely in that house!

526
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,320
Ask them to pay the fees!

527
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,920
We lost the match
and now the fees as well!

528
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,640
The children will be out of the
house, if you yell all the time.

529
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,880
If I take my son along with me...

530
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,200
everyone keeps asking me
if he is the neighbor's kid.

531
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,480
Though we are
the ones who gave birth to him...

532
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,680
they are imprinting
themselves on him.

533
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,640
Ask them to pay.

534
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,800
What sort of a logic is that?

535
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,760
It's not logic. It's Law. If
someone rents a house...

536
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,160
and stays there continuously for
a span of 10 years...

537
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,160
that house becomes theirs.

538
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,320
The rules are for
the house as well as for the kids.

539
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,240
Don't you know that!

540
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,360
Such bad karma!

541
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,760
His ego is vexing me!

542
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
What happened, sister?

543
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,880
He is putting me through hell
because of his foolish ego.

544
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,000
Where is the coffee?

545
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,120
I am getting it.

546
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Take this coffee
and splash it all over his face!

547
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,360
Okay...

548
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,680
Don't take me literally.
Just go and give it to him.

549
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,480
I know that, sister.

550
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,440
Alia Bhatt looks hot!

551
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,880
Brother-in-law, coffee.

552
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,000
I asked her to get it.
Why did you bring it?

553
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,480
Looks like she's developed
an attitude...

554
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,760
Wait. I'll go and set it right.

555
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,440
All this happens in
the open kitchen...

556
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,680
Nothing happens behind locked doors.

557
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,600
Bring it out.

558
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,560
How long should I sit there?
Go and sit there.

559
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,400
How delicate.

560
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,320
Darling, get me some coffee.

561
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,120
How does it matter
who brings it for you?

562
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,320
You won't get it.
It's a matter of ego.

563
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,320
This is how my fate's written.

564
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,960
One day, I will give her
a lesson on it.

565
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,520
Did you wear lipstick?

566
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,320
Lipstick? Of course, not.

567
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
Didn't I tell you that you mustn't
wear lipstick unless it's...

568
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,040
my birthday or our anniversary?

569
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,280
What about the rest of the days?

570
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Not good for health.

571
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,280
If her lips crack, I will be
the one who will end up suffering.

572
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,840
Rub it off. With a wet cloth.

573
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,200
Why do you wear lipstick when you
don't want to kiss? - Go inside.

574
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,360
She is wiping it.

575
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,400
Brother-in-law, I need to talk
to you about something.

576
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Do you want the tattoo "my
brother-in-law is my God"?

577
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,520
Please, listen to me.

578
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,640
Tell me.

579
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,520
The other day,
I met someone at the beach.

580
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,560
Didn't I tell you?

581
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,240
Guys of this city go wild even for
ordinary faces. - So what now?

582
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,520
He said he liked me.

583
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,720
He challenged me that
he would come to where I lived. .

584
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,080
He will definitely lose.

585
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,480
I am confident
that no one would come here.

586
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,720
That is why I brought you from there
and made you stay here.

587
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,640
The problem is right here.
He is coming everyday.

588
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,040
It's not that easy.

589
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,480
To enter into our colony...

590
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,080
Aadhaar needs to be authenticated
and my phone gets an OTP.

591
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,960
Well, brother-in-law...
- Shhh!

592
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,560
That fellow will not be able to
set foot within our boundaries.

593
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,440
Not the colony,
he came in the house.

594
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Who is it?

595
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,840
You neighbor Siddhu.

596
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,160
Siddhu!

597
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,800
You keep the company of one woman
and court the other.

598
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,200
Since I am intelligent,
I figured this out fast.

599
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,160
You don't worry.

600
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,600
He doesn't have
the guts to tease you.

601
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,440
I won't spare him
if he hurts my ego.

602
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,040
So, you will not have any problems
from neither him nor anyone else.

603
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,400
I will make sure it stays that way.

604
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,760
I made a mistake, sir.
Please let me go.

605
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,880
Did the courage that you have...

606
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,360
when there were people
surrounding you...

607
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,360
turn into fear in
the midst of these four walls?

608
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,440
The monstrosity of
Rajan in Macharla.

609
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,440
Rajan brutally murdered
the district Collector.

610
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,400
Sir, I made a mistake. Forgive me.

611
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,800
Did you see me
murder the district collector?

612
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,280
With this eyes.

613
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,880
No. Did you see it or no?

614
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,320
Macharla has a history.

615
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,640
There was never
a man born who pointed fingers...

616
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,400
at Rajan nor raised voice
against Rajan's empire...

617
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,160
And no such man ever lived.

618
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,280
30 years ago
that Macharla is Unanimous?!

619
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,600
If you come
and want to start the elections...

620
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,880
all the men of the constituency
will raise up again...

621
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,760
Watching your death will ensure that
for the next 30 years...

622
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,480
no one would ever entertain
such thoughts.

623
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
So?

624
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,920
Weren't you defending
this collector?

625
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,000
Do you want to go to hell with him?

626
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,440
You saw everything. Now write.

627
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,920
Ravi!

628
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,080
I don't like deaths
because of hunger.

629
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
Feed him until his belly is full
and then kill.

630
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,800
Taking Rajan's name is crime.

631
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,960
Those who commit
this crime are given death penalty.

632
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,920
Sister? What is it, Swati?

633
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,240
Does brother-in-law know an advocate
by the name Satya Murthy?

634
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,400
What for?

635
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,640
Nothing, sister.
It's just research for my project.

636
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,160
He doesn't know anyone other
than that tattoo artist.

637
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,120
Please, sister.

638
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,640
I really need to meet him.
Let's ask brother-in-law.

639
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,120
Do you see that photo?

640
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,760
Just to satiate his ego,
he's put us out of focus.

641
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,560
You really won't get
any help from him.

642
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,480
Let's do this.

643
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,320
Our neighbor is a well
- connected man.

644
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,080
He can help you.
- Alright, let's go.

645
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,600
Hi, aunty.

646
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,000
Hi, Sukanya. Come in, come in.

647
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,880
This is my uncle's daughter Swati.

648
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,360
Greeting, aunty.
- God bless you.

649
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,560
That means my mother
likes her as well.

650
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,080
Come, sit down.

651
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,640
Sit down, dear.

652
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,600
Swati here wants to meet
advocate Satya Murthy.

653
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,240
We just wanted to know if uncle knew
him. That is why we came by.

654
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,200
Advocate Satya Murthy?

655
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,200
One minute.

656
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Hi, Siddhu.

657
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,080
Do your father know of
an advocate named Satya Murthy?

658
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,560
Murthy uncle? I know him.

659
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,480
He is a family friend.

660
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,640
Well, call him at once and tell him
that I am on my way to meet him.

661
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,640
Share his location with me.

662
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,560
Okay? Bye.

663
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,480
Siddhu?

664
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,680
Hello?

665
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,400
Who do you have to meet?

666
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,880
I am here. You should have asked me.

667
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
An advocate called Satya
Murthy, Siddhu.

668
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,760
Satya Murthy?

669
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,040
Yes, Murthy uncle!

670
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,440
He is very close to me, you know?
- When do you have to go?

671
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,960
I will take you there. Come.

672
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,760
Not me, Siddhu. It's for Swati.

673
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,120
Oh, it's not you? It's for Swati?

674
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,480
Siddhu, she is young.

675
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,440
Just take her with you.

676
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,400
What else, dear?
Problem is solved, isn't it?

677
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,600
Actually, Siddhu himself
is the problem.

678
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,080
My husband is most surely
not going to agree...

679
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,280
if Siddhu is going to take her.

680
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,040
I have a plan for that.

681
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,760
Eat.

682
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,120
Again I have to eat
an apple? - Dear!

683
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,880
Swati has some work so
she need to go outside.

684
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Did you see that?

685
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,840
She just came into
the house very recently...

686
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,080
and she's asking me
permission to go out.

687
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,880
Did you ever given the permission?

688
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,120
Today permission, and tomorrow
she will ask for commission.

689
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,400
Why are you pouting like a frog?
Do you want to eat snacks?

690
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,120
Well, I just said it to
make it sound cool.

691
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,240
Tell her that permission
is granted. - Here.

692
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,720
It's good that you gave her
the permission.

693
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,080
But when Siddhu was asked to
accompany her, he said no.

694
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,680
Good riddance. He is a nuisance!

695
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
That's not it.

696
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,720
Someone as strict as you gave her
the go ahead.

697
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,080
Now if he says no, isn't
your ego being trampled upon?

698
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,960
The work is done.

699
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,880
Yes, it is.

700
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,840
Tell him that I told him to go.
- He will have no choice.

701
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,880
He said that if you command him...

702
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,240
he will most definitely
not go at all.

703
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,080
How dare him!

704
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,240
Siddhu, I need to talk to you.

705
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,840
You are already talking
to me. Tell me.

706
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,720
You said you aren't going to do
something that my wife asked you to.

707
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,600
Yes. You are my enemy, right?

708
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,560
So what?

709
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,680
I don't like you at all.

710
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
But you and my wife do
get along, right?

711
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
If she asks you,
shouldn't you oblige?

712
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,200
I won't go.
- You must.

713
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,120
I will not.
- You must!

714
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,000
Say it directly instead
of over the phone?

715
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,720
If I did it directly,
it would sound like a request.

716
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,440
If I did it over the phone,
it would sound like a command.

717
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,400
You should go! Should go! Should go!

718
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,320
I will not go!
I will not go! I will go!

719
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,040
You will have to go, at any cost.
Understood?

720
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,720
He's going?

721
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,320
That too because of my fear.

722
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
Sorry, boss.
- It's okay.

723
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,960
The girl is hot...

724
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,280
I didn't see that. Sorry... Sorry...

725
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,160
What the hell is this?

726
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,400
Swati! Get down...

727
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,440
Leave it.

728
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,200
Get down
- Leave it.

729
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,600
I am going to screw them up.
- Go.

730
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,880
Let's go...
- Get down.

731
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,560
Get down. - What happened?
- Leave her with us and get lost.

732
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,760
Hey, shut up.

733
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,040
Stop. - Please go on.
- Don't just stare.

734
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,960
Move... move...

735
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,520
Siddhu, take it easy.

736
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,840
Fighting isn't
the solution for any problem.

737
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,400
It's easy to get into fights
but very difficult to get out.

738
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,000
You are a good person.

739
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,040
You are a soon to be Civil servant.

740
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,760
It doesn't suit you.

741
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,600
This is how I am.

742
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,920
If something goes wrong right
in front of my eyes...

743
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,000
I cannot stop myself from reacting.

744
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,280
That's why I chose civil services.

745
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,920
Civil servant is not just a job.
It's a responsibility.

746
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,960
Mom tell me, what's up?

747
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,760
What happened?
You seem very irritable.

748
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,680
Nothing, while getting here,
someone on the road irritated me.

749
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,680
Did you thrash him?
- I would have.

750
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,120
But Swati was beside me.

751
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,440
Where would that fellow go?
I am sure he lives in this city.

752
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,880
Someday when
the stars are not in his favour...

753
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
he will cross paths with you.

754
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,480
Can't you see? Are you blind?

755
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,680
Can't you drive slowly?

756
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,240
Sorry, grandpa. Pick up your things.

757
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,920
Mom, you are right.
Their bad time is started.

758
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,240
Go away.

759
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,160
I will try my level best.

760
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,560
Thank you, sir.

761
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,320
Are you done?

762
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,520
It didn't...
but I hope it will be done.

763
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,280
"When you walk with a swag,
my heart skips a beat."

764
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,800
"I want to catch a glimpse of you."

765
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,800
"When you walk with a swag,
my heart skips a beat."

766
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,600
"I want to catch a glimpse of you."

767
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,320
"Your aloofness will take my life."

768
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,840
"Don't tease me so much, dear."

769
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:55,200
"My heart is in love.
Don't make it pine."

770
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:04,480
"Do me a favour and take my life."

771
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,774
"If you end this story of love..."

772
00:41:09,854 --> 00:41:14,520
"you will repent later."

773
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,560
(Rap Song)

774
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,280
(Rap Song)

775
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,880
(Rap Song)

776
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,400
(Rap Song)

777
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,800
(Rap Song)

778
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,280
"Your dark tresses set up a trap."

779
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,480
"You know me so well, yet
why do you ask so many questions?"

780
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,520
"How do I praise
your alluring eyes?"

781
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,480
"You look stunning,
be it day or night."

782
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,240
"I have got my world,
after meeting you."

783
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,800
"You are my reason to live."

784
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:35,320
"I have given my heart to you.
You dwell in my eyes."

785
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:43,960
"Do me a favour and take my life."

786
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:54,320
"If you end this story of love,
you will repent later."

787
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,160
Do I have to remind all those fools?

788
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,600
Excuse me.
- Don't touch.

789
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,160
Happy wedding anniversary.

790
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Same to me.

791
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,360
This time, let me wear lipstick
on our wedding anniversary.

792
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,280
Please. - Rub
the mud from outside on your lips.

793
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,920
I didn't get any call
since morning. Go.

794
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,880
At least answer my missed call.

795
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,040
Please. Someone wish me.

796
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,680
Tell me.

797
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,640
Sorry, brother. I missed your call.

798
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,880
Yeah, as if you are
a Miss **Universe...

799
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,040
And that's why you missed my call!

800
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,120
It's my wedding anniversary today.
Won't you wish me?

801
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,440
Oh? Happy wedding anniversary,
brother.

802
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,160
Thank you. How nice of
you to remember it.

803
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,960
Well, brother.
You gave me a missed call...

804
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,640
Stupid nonsense!
Was that necessary to say.

805
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,200
I have a lot more calls to attend.
- Listen...

806
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,240
Every idiot calls me
and disturbs me.

807
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,840
Hi!

808
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,080
Why would you add such wild moves
for just montage song.

809
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,840
I am on a small high.
All good vibes.

810
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:37,960
Sit down.

811
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,120
She enjoyed
a few minutes of your company...

812
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,280
do you think she has fallen for you?

813
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,880
Yeah... Almost.

814
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,800
That won't happen.
I will not let that happen.

815
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,720
Why?

816
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
My ego doesn't allow that.

817
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,040
What does your ego need
in order to be satisfied?

818
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,200
By giving me respect!

819
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,080
Tell me how much of respect
do you want...

820
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,600
I'll place the order on
- line. - Please go ahead and order.

821
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,320
Half a kilo of respect
and a quarter kilo of Pav Bhaji.

822
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,160
From which hotel?
- From your father's restaurant.

823
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,760
I mean RESPECT. I want respect.

824
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,880
Oh!

825
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,480
Okay, Guru ji.

826
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,520
Just because you address me
with respect, is that all?

827
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,480
Let me know if have to added
something else as well.

828
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,800
You can buy me...

829
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,760
You might have bought me with this.
But you cannot buy my ego.

830
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,280
It's of my size.

831
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,120
What else do you want me
to do, Guruji?

832
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,920
Generally, what do you usually do...

833
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,360
if it was your parents'
wedding anniversary?

834
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,760
I will celebrate it.

835
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,920
What if it's yours?

836
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,360
I'll go crazy.

837
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,000
What if it was mine?

838
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,680
Oh you mean... hey.

839
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,280
It's your anniversary, Guruji.

840
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,960
We're going to have
a party in the evening.

841
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,760
I don't like party.
I am a private person.

842
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,400
Please... please...
Just for me... for me...

843
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,600
Alright, alright.
- Do a grand job of it.

844
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,640
If not, I will return
the ring back to you.

845
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
Okay.
- Go.

846
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,360
Come, Srikanya.

847
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,480
Oh no!

848
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,480
Sukanya.
- Yes, dear.

849
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,480
Do you still have the lipstick
or did you use it all up?

850
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,680
How can it be all used up when
I haven't used it at all?

851
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,800
Use it.

852
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,080
Thank you, darling.
- Why did you sit? Get up!

853
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,160
Turn that side.

854
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,120
Happy wedding anniversary.

855
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,080
Hi, aunty.

856
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,080
The girl looks like a goddess.

857
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,600
Yes, she looks very beautiful.

858
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,600
Do you like her a lot, isn't it?

859
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,920
Are you fixated on having her as
your daughter-in-law?

860
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,040
Don't worry. I am there.

861
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,400
I'll go and speak with her.

862
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,680
What happened?
Why are you sleeping like that?

863
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,960
I am feeling childish.

864
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,400
Awwww!

865
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,840
Don't say awwww.

866
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,600
You said it was
an anniversary party.

867
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,120
But you ended up getting me
remarried to her.

868
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,920
I am really feeling shy.

869
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,440
So cute, Guruji.

870
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,880
Nothing Cute!

871
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,760
Well, what's everyone talking about?

872
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,680
Talk?

873
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,840
Guruji, you are a next level stuff.

874
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,920
You are looking like a rock
- star.

875
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,120
What happened, Guruji?

876
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,600
Why are you praising someone
else in front of me?

877
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,600
Wow!

878
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,680
When you don't let even
your shadow overshadow you...

879
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,560
I must admit you are
the father of egotistical behavior!

880
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,120
Now I am satisfied.

881
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,680
But I am unhappy.

882
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,680
But I am happy.

883
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,160
But I am not satisfied.

884
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,600
Fine, what do you want me
to do for your satisfaction?

885
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,560
The bed is decorated so well.

886
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,640
My heart is bigger than this.

887
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,160
I am feeling nostalgic.
- After all these years?

888
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,000
Yes.
- Oh my God!

889
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,560
Gap?
- What do you mean?

890
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,960
I mean when children are born...

891
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,240
the parents devote all
their times to them .

892
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,400
Oh, you mean that.

893
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,760
No... no...

894
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,280
Yes, there is a huge gap.

895
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,120
I have a very good medicine to
cure you of your blues...

896
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,240
and bring you back to form, Guruji.

897
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,320
Is it Red bull?

898
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,320
No.

899
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,920
It's bed bull.

900
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,680
Do you really think this will
help me regain my vitality?

901
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,720
Not back to your vitality.
Much more than that.

902
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,160
You will knock it out of the park.

903
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,480
Knocking it out of
the park is really not necessary.

904
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,800
I want to perform like Dhoni till
the last over.

905
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,280
And I want to finish it in style.

906
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,480
Oh yeah, wow! Put it in your mouth
and forget everything.

907
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,560
What about Bunty?

908
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,040
I will take care of Bunty.
You go ahead.

909
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,760
Listen.

910
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,520
It has flavour also.

911
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,000
Of course. You need to spread
the aroma Enjoy.

912
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,200
Go away... go...

913
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,520
Swati!

914
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,800
Today I want to tell you
something about me.

915
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,840
I wonder what that is.

916
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,240
Flirting and dating is
a waste of time...

917
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,040
If you want to know
their character...

918
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,000
listen to the play list
on the phone.

919
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,880
You are going to know about my
character with only three songs.

920
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,320
Is this really necessary, Siddhu...

921
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,960
Of course, they are very necessary.

922
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,600
Listen it.

923
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,520
Take it. Listen it.

924
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,920
Brother...
- Tell me.

925
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,560
You planned my father's party just
to impress her, isn't it?

926
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,600
Yes, I used betel nut leaf
wrap to coax your father.

927
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,040
Actually I wanted to
impress her. - Oh!

928
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,760
1st song... is from Raariya...

929
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,680
"Feel my, feel my, feel my love."

930
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,040
"Feel my, feel my, feel my love."

931
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,800
(Other language)

932
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,800
(Other language)

933
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,280
You listen to these things?

934
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,520
I am a nature lover, right?

935
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,360
I did not tell to anyone
but this is my inspiration.

936
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,280
I get more closer to
the nature by listening this songs.

937
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,120
Next song, please.

938
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,600
Second song is fantastic.

939
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,680
"This my abode, my world."

940
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,920
"This my abode, my world."

941
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,160
"Let's adore the charm of beauty."

942
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:26,520
"See the style of blooming youth."

943
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,280
"It is intoxicating."

944
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,080
You listen to these songs?
- Of course.

945
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,920
It's my favourite songs.
I listen it every day.

946
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,880
We get peace of mind by listen
this type of songs.

947
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,880
One's mind stays fresh.

948
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,440
You should listen to third song.

949
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,360
It will really clear your mind.

950
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,680
Please play the final number.

951
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,880
The third song is mind blowing.

952
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,560
"I am high in love."

953
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,360
"Come and be mine."

954
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,200
Wait. Why is this song being played?

955
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,080
This isn't my phone.

956
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,160
It is your brother-in-law's phone.

957
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,320
Where is my phone?

958
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,040
This is my phone.

959
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,600
Please listen my play list.

960
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,920
That's enough songs
for today, please.

961
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,320
Swati! Wait.

962
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,040
My plan to impress you with
the songs failed.

963
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,240
I don't know
how to woo you with my words.

964
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,240
But, the feelings
for you that you see in my eyes.

965
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,640
Understand yourself whatever
I want to tell you.

966
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,680
I will express
in words by some other days.

967
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,040
Bye.

968
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,840
Guruji, may I come in?

969
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,560
Come in.

970
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,120
What about sister-in-law?

971
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,440
Even your sister-in-law
asked you to come in.

972
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,720
Guruji? Guruji?

973
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,560
Come. Did you stay awake
the whole night?

974
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,640
You look like a lion exhausted
from making a kill.

975
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,800
A lion you say?

976
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,160
Ask your sister-in-law.
- Sister-in-law?

977
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,120
Sister-in-law?

978
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,440
Where is sister-in-law?

979
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,840
In the lobby!
- What do you mean?

980
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,120
You've ruined my night...

981
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,240
with your eagerness You locked me
up in the room!

982
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,960
Couldn't you have called me?

983
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,600
When did you give me
that opportunity?

984
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,840
I will take care of it. You eat it.

985
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,840
What about these marks on your body?

986
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,360
(Other language)

987
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,080
(Other language)

988
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,640
(Other language)

989
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,560
Strange. Sukanya!

990
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,600
The room is locked.
What do I do now?

991
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,200
(Other language)

992
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,960
(Other language)

993
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,600
(Other language)

994
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,280
(Other language)

995
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,120
You mean to say that the betel
nut wrap worked really well.

996
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,160
Yes, really well.

997
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,680
They asked me
to fast and gave me lemon juice.

998
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,600
I have upset stomach.
I just needed a laxative.

999
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,800
Sorry, Guruji. I didn't expect such
a thing to happen.

1000
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,560
Did you bear a grudge against me
and plan all this?

1001
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,480
Stop it, Guruji. Why will I bear
a grudge against you?

1002
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,880
Was that betel nut
leaf wrap or bomb?

1003
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,040
Would you like me to plan this again
for another day?

1004
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,280
I don't want you plan
nor your betel nut leaf wrap.

1005
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,120
Guruji.
- Don't touch me. Just go.

1006
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,200
Please leave me alone for some time.

1007
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,320
Please, stay away from me
for at least 2 days.

1008
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,800
I can't help you in this matter.

1009
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,480
Please, sir.
If you can help me a bit...

1010
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,840
I am sorry. You can leave.

1011
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,520
Do you remember this place, Siddhu?

1012
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,200
This is the place where we met for
the first time.

1013
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,120
This is one of the most important
places of my life.

1014
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,520
How can I forget it?

1015
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,960
That day when I met you...

1016
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,720
I thought I was going
to end up with...

1017
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,160
a lot of problems because of you.

1018
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,360
But surprisingly, you turned
out to be a great help.

1019
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,400
You took me to every place where
I can't reach myself.

1020
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,960
You helped me meet every one.

1021
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,080
You spent all of your time on me.

1022
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,400
I will never forget this, Siddhu.

1023
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,600
Thank you, Siddhu.

1024
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,760
Too much ego will kill
your talent...

1025
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,840
Right!

1026
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,320
Who is this?

1027
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,760
Guruji, I am here.

1028
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,080
I can see it.

1029
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,320
You got both the flowers
and the stems.

1030
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,680
I came to propose.

1031
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,000
To whom?

1032
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,520
Who else? Swati, of course!

1033
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,440
Stop!

1034
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,320
Take those flowers and tuck them
between your ears.

1035
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,480
And take the stems
and shove it down.

1036
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,440
Why do you say that, Guruji?

1037
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,680
Swati isn't here anymore.

1038
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,280
She finished what she came here for
and so she went back home.

1039
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,560
Where did she go?

1040
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,440
"Swati went somewhere..."

1041
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,640
"Now, Siddhu is all alone."

1042
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,760
"Oh, cool breeze..."

1043
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,880
Did you already know about this?

1044
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,080
I did.

1045
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,800
Why didn't you tell me, Guru?

1046
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,400
Guru?

1047
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,200
Where is the respect
that should have been there?

1048
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,680
I spend time with Swati.

1049
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,960
Now that she is gone, why would
I still address you respectfully?

1050
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:37,400
Siddhu, I took revenge
of provoking my ego.

1051
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,400
Where is Swati?

1052
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,760
Macharla.

1053
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,640
Siddhu, what did Swati say?

1054
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,400
Hey, hold on.

1055
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,480
Why are you leaving without
answering me?

1056
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,600
Did she agree?

1057
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,920
Swati wasn't there to give me
an answer, mother.

1058
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,000
Where did she go?

1059
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,480
Macharla.

1060
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,000
She is from Macherla?

1061
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,160
She is from our village.

1062
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,640
What are you saying, mother?

1063
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,680
It's true.

1064
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,240
Your father's holds
a great reputation there.

1065
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,920
Really? My father holds
such huge reputation?

1066
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,480
He might look a little silly...

1067
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,600
but those days the way your father
carried himself... was huge.

1068
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,680
As soon as they know
that you are his son...

1069
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,520
her parents are going to marry
her off to you in a heartbeat.

1070
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,640
Go... go...

1071
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,320
Go and get me my daughter-in-law.

1072
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,680
Oh, my mother.

1073
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,320
Thank you, thank you so much.

1074
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,080
Finally, you are here.

1075
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,240
Why are you so late?

1076
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,240
Come, food is ready.

1077
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,160
Where is Siddhu?

1078
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,480
Ask him to join us.
Let's eat together.

1079
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,200
He is not here.

1080
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,080
He went to Swati next door.

1081
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,200
Swati?

1082
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,280
These days he's been spending
way too much time with her.

1083
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,520
If Nidhi gets to know about it
then? - Make him understand.

1084
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,360
No need of making him understand.

1085
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,160
He has not only went to meet Swati.

1086
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,600
He's gone to propose to Swati.

1087
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,760
Have you gone crazy?

1088
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,840
When Nidhi is here, why would he go
and propose to Swati?

1089
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,120
He's decided that
he wants Swati as his wife.

1090
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,840
And even I am okay with it.

1091
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,600
If she gets ready.
Will soon marry them.

1092
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,920
You mean that I would die in peace.

1093
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,760
Is it okay if you and your son
decided amongst yourselves?

1094
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,680
There is no need for me.

1095
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,200
If Nidhi gets to know about it,
she might kill herself.

1096
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Where exactly did Siddhu go?

1097
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,480
Macharla.

1098
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:32,960
Macharla?

1099
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,760
Why are you so shocked
after hearing that name?

1100
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,200
I think your old memories
are refreshed. Right?

1101
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,920
Perhaps you don't know about me
because you are new here.

1102
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,920
No matter who comes here,
they will have to obey me.

1103
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,240
Pass my tender.

1104
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,600
Rajan!

1105
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,560
I seem quite tamed because
I occupy this position.

1106
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,200
If I set this aside, I am
an even bigger goon than you are.

1107
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,200
Understood.

1108
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,960
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

1109
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,400
What would have happened if
I told you the rest?

1110
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,120
I would have said no for marriage.

1111
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,360
That is why I didn't say the rest.

1112
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,960
Given the half
- baked truth you told me...

1113
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,600
I sent Siddhu there.

1114
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,760
Now, what do we do?

1115
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,400
Oh no! why is she calling me now?

1116
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,440
Give her any excuse. Talk to her.

1117
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,400
Both the son and
his mother will cost me my life!

1118
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,560
Hello, dear.

1119
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,880
Uncle, I keep calling Siddhu
but he is not lifting my phone.

1120
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,640
Where is he?
- Siddhu...

1121
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,960
He...

1122
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,800
Actually... - What happened, uncle?
Is everything alright? - Yes.

1123
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,680
Oh... northing's wrong, dear.

1124
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,200
Well, where is Siddhu then?
- Siddhu is...

1125
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,800
Tell me
- Tell her!

1126
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,040
He went to meet our neighbor Swati.

1127
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,680
Went to meet a girl?

1128
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,640
Who is she?

1129
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,400
Is he eloped with her?

1130
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,920
No... no... no... Of course, not.

1131
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,800
When you are still around.
- Then...

1132
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,800
Tell her that Siddhu eloped.

1133
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,000
But something similar to that.

1134
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,920
Nidhi, don't take
these things to heart.

1135
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,920
I will make sure you guys are
together. It's my guaranty.

1136
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,400
Are you there?

1137
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,440
I wonder what she's going to do.

1138
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,400
God knows what will she do now.

1139
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,320
Serve me food.

1140
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,240
Do you know her?

1141
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,200
You are young and you are a girl.

1142
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,000
Are you spying on us?

1143
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,880
Don't you get fear of?

1144
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,320
If anyone loses their fear of us,
they can no longer live.

1145
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,600
Siddhu, why did you come here?

1146
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,640
Please leave.

1147
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,280
Please leave. Siddhu, please.

1148
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,880
Who the hell are you?

1149
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,400
Come on.

1150
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,480
How dare you to touch her?

1151
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,400
If you are that brave, deal with me.

1152
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,480
Come! Come!

1153
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,400
Burn me! Come on.

1154
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,360
Who the hell are you?

1155
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,520
Who are you?

1156
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,840
Ravi!

1157
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,640
Our issue is with her.

1158
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,160
Who are you to interfere?

1159
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,080
What did she do?!

1160
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,520
She is his granddaughter!

1161
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,440
She wants to go to Vizag
to file cases against...

1162
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,000
us because we killed her brother.

1163
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,240
No matter what you do in
the entire state...

1164
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,680
we will surely know about it.

1165
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,440
Is that the reason why she took me
around the whole of Vizag?

1166
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,400
Oh!

1167
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,280
I understand what your problem is.

1168
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,240
It's better you understand that...

1169
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,080
I am in love with that girl.

1170
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,560
I came here just to tell her that.

1171
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,040
I am there for Swati.

1172
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,040
After that, it's your wish.

1173
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,440
How foolish of you to propose
your feelings at this place.

1174
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,320
There are thirty of us here.

1175
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,560
A total of three have
already fallen.

1176
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,680
There are 27 left.

1177
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,200
And including me, it's 28.

1178
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,600
Someone or the other amongst us
will kill you.

1179
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,680
This isn't your place,
neither is it your village.

1180
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,040
Why are you interfering?

1181
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,680
Just leave the way you came.

1182
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,680
If we talk this out, it would be
the decent thing to do.

1183
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,840
But if you want me
to use my fists...

1184
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,840
your bodies are going
to be couriered.

1185
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,440
Don't you understand me?

1186
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,960
You have come here seeking death.

1187
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,080
Go ahead and kill the both of them.

1188
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,040
Siddhu!

1189
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,880
Tell me, dad. I am busy.

1190
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,120
How can you get busy already?

1191
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,000
Just tell me. What is it, father?

1192
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,600
We got the letter of your posting.

1193
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,040
Posting?
- Where I have been posted?

1194
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,000
It's in Guntur district.

1195
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,440
Where?
- Guntur district.

1196
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,200
Guntur district.

1197
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,080
A while ago someone asked me
'Who are you'?

1198
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,640
There's good news
for all of you here.

1199
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,400
From now on, I am the district
collector for you all...

1200
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,040
this village
and the entire Guntur district...

1201
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,760
Siddhu... Siddharth Reddy, IAS.

1202
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,440
Why do I care who you are?

1203
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,360
I am Rajan's son!

1204
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,960
You came to Macharla
and dare manhandle Rajan's son?!

1205
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,640
Rajan or whoever's
the bloody fellow you are!

1206
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,520
There is only one treatment
for you all!

1207
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,200
No issues if it's 30 or 300 goons.

1208
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,760
I don't care at all.

1209
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,400
Since I got posted here as
the district collector...

1210
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,480
I tamed my fists a little.

1211
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,240
Or else I would hit with
the full force.

1212
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,040
Listen, Ravi...

1213
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,640
Go and tell this to your father.

1214
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,840
Until now, beasts have
hunted humans.

1215
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,880
And now, I am here to hunt
the wild animal like you all.

1216
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,840
From now on, things are going to be
operated at a different level!

1217
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,360
Despite having her
family with her...

1218
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,680
if a girl fights hard by putting her
life at stake.

1219
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,560
There could only be two reasons.

1220
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,600
She must have
a strong desire for hiding it.

1221
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,280
Or else, she must have lost trust.

1222
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,640
Who is Rajan?

1223
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,320
What is the issue between him
and your family?

1224
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,400
This issue is not something
that's recent.

1225
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,280
It began 30 years ago.

1226
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,760
My grandfather supported his son in
the elections against Rajan.

1227
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,280
On the day of the elections,
they killed him.

1228
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,680
Rajan would be elected unanimously
and made sure that no voting...

1229
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,200
in the elections took place.

1230
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,040
Every one here is used to living
with a constant fear of Rajan...

1231
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,560
My brother wanted to
end that fear...

1232
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,240
and stood against him in elections.

1233
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,640
'Please try to understand. '

1234
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,760
'Just as you desired,
you became a civil servant. '

1235
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,360
'Instead of enjoying yourself...

1236
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,840
why would you want to pick
a fight with Rajan? '

1237
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,920
'Please don't do that, son. '

1238
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,040
'Father, the fear inside...

1239
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,840
us is even more dangerous than
the fear he instills in us. '

1240
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,840
'Any case,
I am not targeting Rajan. '

1241
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,560
'I am just targeting
the fear within the people. '

1242
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,320
'It's not that easy, son. '

1243
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,720
'It's not that hard
either, father. '

1244
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,200
'If free and fair elections
are conducted here once, '

1245
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,880
'the people here will be
filled with courage. '

1246
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,080
'Elections are not a five...

1247
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,360
year affair where ink is smeared on
the fingers. '

1248
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,320
'It's about the future. '

1249
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,880
Even though my brother died...

1250
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,280
I came to Vizag to keep his ideals
and vision alive.

1251
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,880
You said that you wanted to study.

1252
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,040
Instead, you brought death
along with you.

1253
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,320
She lost her husband right
in front of her eyes.

1254
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,680
That kid lost her father
and she became widow.

1255
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,920
Can't you see them and their state
right in front of your eyes?

1256
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,680
He is devil
and your are a weak girl.

1257
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,440
Did you forget
how Rajan killed your brother?

1258
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,280
I didn't forget it, father.

1259
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,760
I am doing all this because
I didn't forget.

1260
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,440
Have you gone crazy?

1261
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,920
Sir, she wants to do something
that you couldn't do for your son.

1262
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,960
Let her do it, sir.

1263
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,440
Young man, since you are new here...

1264
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,520
you don't know the situation
and the environment here.

1265
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,360
I am happy that you came
for my daughter.

1266
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,040
Listen to me, dear.

1267
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,800
If possible, take her back with you.

1268
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,120
At least then,
the both of you will stay alive.

1269
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,640
Should I run away and save myself?

1270
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,360
Or else, should
I save justice by staying back?

1271
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,040
One minute, sir.

1272
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,680
Rajan doesn't tolerate anyone
hitting his men.

1273
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,520
And now, this guy goes
and bashes Rajan's son!

1274
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,080
Do you think Rajan will stay quiet?

1275
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,080
He will kill him.
He will kill everyone.

1276
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,000
Who did this?

1277
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,400
How many was there?

1278
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,440
It's not "They".

1279
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,760
It's just one person.

1280
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,280
It must be
because he doesn't know it's us.

1281
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,840
He knew who we were.

1282
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,760
Shut up!

1283
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,320
Have you lost your masculinity!
All got beaten up from one guy.

1284
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,160
Hey! He didn't hit you.

1285
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,520
He hit the reputation that
I built for the past 30 years.

1286
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,480
Where is he?

1287
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,520
Father, I love you.

1288
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,560
I don't know why...

1289
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,960
but whenever you tell me
that you love me...

1290
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,760
my heart beats even faster.
- Don't say this.

1291
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,400
I came here for Swati and you got me
posted here.

1292
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,320
You are indeed superb, father!

1293
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,240
Oh? Is that how you understood this?

1294
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,760
Do you know what happened?

1295
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,280
Even the water in
your house tastes delicious.

1296
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,200
What is this, dear? Marriage card?

1297
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,120
Hold on.

1298
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,960
What did we agree on?

1299
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,280
I remember it, dear.

1300
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,680
It's my responsibility to get him
married to you.

1301
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,680
And you would convince
your father first.

1302
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,360
Nice coffee.

1303
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,480
He doesn't get posted
to Guntur district.

1304
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,520
Isn't that right?
- Yes.

1305
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,360
Now, take a look at that.

1306
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,240
So, you are feeling shy to say.

1307
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,360
Why didn't you smear the corners
with some turmeric and saffron?

1308
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,480
That's the posting letter
of your son as...

1309
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,920
the new collector of
the Guntur district.

1310
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,440
This is unfair, isn't it?

1311
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,480
If what I did is unfair.

1312
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,680
What you did to me is unfair as
well. The deal is cancelled.

1313
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,320
How can you break it off so easily?

1314
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,040
Why does the water taste weird?

1315
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,640
A little while ago, you said that
the water tasted delicious.

1316
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,600
I did say that.

1317
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,720
I would say, if the posting
would be according to me.

1318
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,960
I would have praised falsely.

1319
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,000
Shall I tell you something
else as well?

1320
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,880
The coffee served
at your house is disgusting!

1321
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,040
Go and tell your mother that!

1322
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,360
That is exactly what happened.

1323
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,600
She is my true friend.

1324
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,960
And you! Have you ever helped me
with any such favors?

1325
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,680
You don't know actual meaning
of friendship.

1326
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,240
She is ready to do anything
for friendship.

1327
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,760
Listen, no matter
what you listen to...

1328
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,920
do you always end up twisting it
in your favor?

1329
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,520
You are still appreciating her!

1330
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,360
Alright, fine.
Cut the call. I'll call you back.

1331
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,160
He has come. It means someone
will surely die today.

1332
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,440
Turn around.

1333
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,440
I must appreciate your courage...

1334
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,440
that you are still in Macherla...

1335
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,760
after raising
your hand on Rajan's son.

1336
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,440
You have lots of courage!

1337
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,400
Oh, you are Rajan?

1338
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,960
If you are thrashed,
you should turn into a patient.

1339
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,040
I was wondering
why is it that you turned old.

1340
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,920
The father
and son look pretty much the same.

1341
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,280
Same as printing machine.

1342
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,360
But you both look very weird.

1343
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,000
No, sir.

1344
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,400
Would - be Collector.
It's a public place, sir.

1345
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,800
We would find it difficult
to control it, sir.

1346
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,560
Sir, please... listen to me.

1347
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,840
You are new to this district.

1348
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,720
But district administrative
officers are not new to me.

1349
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,560
Fear in this town was born
even before you were born.

1350
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,920
For 30 years, there hasn't been...

1351
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,880
a single person
who revolted against me.

1352
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,680
Usually, I am not
the one to give chances.

1353
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,440
But you have good fortune today.

1354
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,000
I am going to flip a coin.

1355
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,760
If it's heads,
you are going to meet your maker.

1356
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,640
If it's tails, leave this town.

1357
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,280
You are lucky. It's tails.

1358
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,880
Leave Macherla
and run away today itself.

1359
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,240
If you want yourself alive!

1360
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,280
You are extremely lucky.

1361
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,200
No one in this entire city has
gotten a chance like you did.

1362
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,680
He would always flip a coin.

1363
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,040
And this is
the first time that it's tails.

1364
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,760
I wish I would have bought
a lottery today. Never mind.

1365
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,000
Pack up... pack all your bags.
And start immediately.

1366
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,160
Yes, pick up the call
and talk to your boss.

1367
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,840
Ask him to change your posting.
And get out of here immediately.

1368
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,560
Sir, are you always like this? Or
you in a state of constant fear?

1369
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,760
Young man, this is Macharla.

1370
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,800
Only those who fear will
be able to survive here.

1371
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,480
Aunty, it's you? Please come in.

1372
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,280
How are you?
- I am fine.

1373
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,200
How are you? I am also fine.

1374
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,760
All of a sudden,
why did you get here?

1375
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,680
What's with all those injuries?
- It's nothing. Just small scuffle.

1376
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,200
Why would you dismiss it like
it's nothing?

1377
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,280
Why did she get here?

1378
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,000
Well, apparently you weren't
picking her calls.

1379
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,240
That is why, she came along with us.

1380
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,960
Hey, Nidhi. How are you?

1381
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,080
Oh, wow! It is scintillatingly hot!

1382
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,720
Hey, Narender!
- Surender!

1383
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,920
How long has it been since
I last saw you? - Right.

1384
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,240
What made you come by so suddenly?

1385
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,200
There... I came for my son.

1386
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,160
He's your son?

1387
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,640
Yes. - Are you guys already
acquainted with each other?

1388
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,920
He is... - You didn't tell her
anything about us?

1389
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,520
He's someone who keeps
a lot of secrets.

1390
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,560
I will tell you.

1391
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,400
Lady, we were...

1392
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,280
To tell you the truth...

1393
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,040
I was partially paralyzed by fear.

1394
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,000
People like me
who are born here have no choice...

1395
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,600
since we were born and raised here.

1396
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,800
But why did you pick
a fight with him?

1397
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,280
It just happened.

1398
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,800
How would I know how dangerous
a fellow he is?!

1399
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,000
Tell me what do I do now?

1400
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,000
What's there to do?

1401
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,960
If you want to stay alive, you
better run away from this place.

1402
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,120
Father and son are opposite
from each other.

1403
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,720
That day, you listened to my words.

1404
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,200
But now, your son doesn't
heed my words.

1405
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,800
What happened?

1406
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,520
As soon as he came to town,
he picked a fight with Rajan.

1407
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,640
You came at the right time.
Knock some sense into him.

1408
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,040
My son was stubborn like him
and I ended up losing him.

1409
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,960
Why all this fuss?

1410
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,400
Siddhu.
- Father.

1411
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,280
I desperately hoped you wouldn't
be posted into this district.

1412
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,880
But you ended up getting
posted here.

1413
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,480
No matter what
the reasons is but it's not good.

1414
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,440
This is enough.

1415
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,360
We don't need these fights.

1416
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:06,880
Please listen to me.

1417
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,920
Let's get out of here.

1418
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,320
Yes, Siddhu. Let it go, son.

1419
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,600
Alright, father. Let's go.

1420
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,600
But look into the eyes of Swati
who lost her brother.

1421
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,680
And the little girl
who lost her father.

1422
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,520
And then, we can leave.

1423
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,720
This isn't the problem of a family.

1424
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,120
It is a problem for
the entire constituency.

1425
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,160
There's no going anywhere.

1426
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,440
I am going to take charge as
the District collector here.

1427
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,360
There was no opposition here.

1428
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,960
But it's there now.

1429
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,800
Sir, every time there is an
election, I donate money.

1430
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,040
But the party has never given me...

1431
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,160
an opportunity
for their candidature.

1432
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,800
This time, I need
a ticket to contest.

1433
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,200
Sir, no matter which constituency
you ask me to be a candidate.

1434
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,400
All the seats for
the state have been confirmed.

1435
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,080
We've already given 'B
- forms'

1436
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,800
But there is
an opportunity for one seat.

1437
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,320
Where?
- Please, tell us.

1438
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,880
Macharla.

1439
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,680
We love our life.

1440
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,680
We will try next time.

1441
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,200
This time again,
Macharla is unanimous.

1442
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,800
Today the new collector...

1443
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,080
of the district will come to
the office for the first time.

1444
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,440
Police and Administration
are eagerly awaiting.

1445
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,600
It's like setting up a canopy for a
wedding that would never happen.

1446
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,160
The Collector won't come!

1447
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,600
Before coming here, he had a tiff
with Rajan in his place, Macherla.

1448
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,600
With the warning
that Rajan gave him...

1449
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,200
he would have run away from
the state itself.

1450
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,560
Oh no! He came here.

1451
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,960
You said he ran away.

1452
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,680
Alright, alright.
What's this bouquet for?

1453
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Just a formality, sir...

1454
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,000
They look fresh.
Put them in the fridge.

1455
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,720
Anyway, he will be killed by him.

1456
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,120
Keep this for
a tombstone for his grave.

1457
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,040
You can same
your money like this. Come on.

1458
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:45,760
Congratulation, sir.

1459
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,240
I am Jay Shankar. I am MDO here.

1460
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,160
Thank you.

1461
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,680
Sir, I am Kailashpati
Congratulations, sir.

1462
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,080
Thank you.
- Welcome, sir.

1463
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,200
Narayan, MRO of Macharla.

1464
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,840
Macharla? I have a lot of work
with you. Keep in touch.

1465
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,920
All the best.

1466
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,280
I wanted to wish him luck?
Why is he wishing me?

1467
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,200
Sir, a civil servant needs to
deal with things delicately.

1468
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,000
You have made quite an impression
at the beginning.

1469
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,200
I shall take my leave, sir.

1470
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,920
What's up, Mr Narayan?

1471
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,760
He seems to be pretty fired up.

1472
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,880
Now its between you and him.

1473
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,200
Your logic is correct.

1474
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,800
When the CM uses violence,
you applaud it.

1475
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,280
When it comes to civil servants...

1476
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,040
everyone expects them to deal
with things delicately.

1477
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,600
But I am born a bit violent.
What do I do?

1478
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,960
Sir, this is your first positing
and you are still so young.

1479
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,800
What changes can
we expect in the district?

1480
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,200
Your reputation precedes you.

1481
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,440
Any comment?

1482
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,360
Neither comment,
nor likes, nor shares. Nothing.

1483
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,280
Direct action.

1484
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,960
This is awesome, Rajan.

1485
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,000
Private place, liquor and meat.

1486
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,600
all the arrangements look brilliant.

1487
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,440
Here... here...
I was expecting this reaction.

1488
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,640
Before someone else tells you about
it, I will tell you this myself.

1489
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,640
I have taken charge as
the district collector...

1490
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,720
It doesn't matter if you are
a collector or a chief minister.

1491
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,400
I will always rule here.

1492
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,800
Aren't you scared of death?

1493
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,920
This is what fear of death means.

1494
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,680
That you all have spread
in Macharla.

1495
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,360
But since I am not from Macharla,
I am not scared.

1496
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,840
I didn't come here to fight.

1497
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,400
I came here to talk about
something else.

1498
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,400
With proper way.

1499
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,720
As I told you that,
I am new to this district.

1500
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,760
That is why from now on, Rules
and regulation will be new too.

1501
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,000
My task is to make sure...

1502
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:17,200
that elections take place in
this constituency.

1503
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,440
Why are you still looking at me?
I said what I came to say.

1504
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,280
It's true. Believe me.

1505
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,520
If you tell me what needs to be
said, I will listen to it.

1506
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:37,680
Assume that this is people and this
is fear which I instilled...

1507
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,000
It cannot be separated.

1508
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,200
Oh my God! What
a dialogue delivery, Mr Rajan!

1509
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,160
Too good!

1510
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,760
The oldie seems to be
a big film junkie.

1511
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,280
Hold on... hold on... Stop.

1512
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,200
Go back.

1513
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,080
He keeps talking like
the prose of villain...

1514
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,800
You guys are
the followers of villain.

1515
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,760
What do I do now?

1516
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,680
I should too present myself as hero.

1517
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,920
Since all of you are
very enthusiastic...

1518
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:15,560
I would ask the most accomplished
amongst you to come forward.

1519
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,800
Just one punch. If
I don't get your hearts racing...

1520
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,640
I swear on Rajan's son.

1521
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,440
I knew it.

1522
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,760
One must be over smart among you.

1523
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,000
You are losing fear
which you had create.

1524
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,560
Stay within your limits
or else you would be cut loose!

1525
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,760
There is only one king in a forest.
The lion, and not the wolves.

1526
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,440
I will deal with your wolves.

1527
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:24,280
Shall we start hunting?

1528
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,760
Recently appointed new collector of
the district...

1529
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,000
talked to the reporters about
the law in the city.

1530
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:54,880
Listen, Siddhu!

1531
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,800
Yes.

1532
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,040
Siddhu, I am sorry.

1533
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,320
I didn't really grasp the gravity...

1534
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,840
of the situation here
and got you posted here.

1535
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,680
I did all this in anger.

1536
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,720
I will speak to my father
and get you posted elsewhere.

1537
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,360
Don't do anything like that.

1538
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,160
I am sure you always have
the best of intentions for me.

1539
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,480
Anyways, why have you changed
your personality so suddenly?

1540
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,960
This isn't really you.
Just be yourself.

1541
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,040
I am really sorry.

1542
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,520
Direct that sorry towards me...

1543
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,880
and I shall leave
on my way out of here.

1544
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,680
Welcome, son-in-law.

1545
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,360
Who told you to speak? Move away!

1546
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,280
Go away.

1547
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,200
Take it...

1548
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,560
Go... Wait.

1549
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,120
Go.

1550
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,080
Hey, Guru. What a lovely surprise!

1551
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,320
Why do you keep talking about
leaving when you just got here?

1552
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,960
What's so urgent?

1553
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,080
It's not an urgency.
It's an emergency.

1554
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,320
I want a sorry right now.

1555
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,920
You came this far for a sorry?

1556
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,480
Swati! Bring him a 'Sari. '

1557
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,800
I am talking about sorry not sari.
Understand?

1558
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,360
Come, dear. Come.
- Brother-in-law!

1559
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,480
How wonderfully annoying!

1560
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,440
Here your romance is going and,
and revenge there.

1561
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,560
Why would you need to be romantic
at your age, Gurunath?

1562
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,640
It's not Gurunath.
- Call me Guru.

1563
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,680
You are a live-in son-in-law.

1564
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,240
Can I call you a pet?

1565
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,680
He assumes
that everyone is exactly like him.

1566
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,840
You already got one here.

1567
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:12,880
If you really want to
pamper him, go ahead!

1568
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,400
What happened Guru?

1569
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,960
You seemed to be fired up,
what happened?

1570
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:20,680
Here he comes in green T-shirt! Has
your whole family arrived here?

1571
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,560
Siddhu, even my wrinkled
shirt also hurts my ego.

1572
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,920
And you stripped me
off my shirt and hit me!

1573
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,400
Unless you apologise to me...

1574
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,360
there is no question of you
ever getting out of here.

1575
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,160
Guru. And you have come here after
a long time.

1576
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,080
Why don't you enjoy the hospitality?

1577
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,440
I need a shower.

1578
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,440
Narender.

1579
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,600
Tell me, Surender.

1580
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,160
Will your son submit to his ego?

1581
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,160
He won't care for Rajan's ego.

1582
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,960
What do we do about Rajan?

1583
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,680
We will deal with him in Macharla.

1584
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,520
Oh! Mr Narayan.

1585
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,280
Such expensive breakfast.

1586
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,960
Now I understood
the secret of your health.

1587
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,480
Nothing like that, sir.

1588
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,920
I am a bit health conscious.

1589
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,880
Aiming for six pack?

1590
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,960
No, sir. My wife keeps saying that.

1591
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,400
But I am finding it difficult.

1592
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,200
Election notification has arrived.
What about the update?

1593
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,320
Hey.
- Sir.

1594
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,520
How many times do
I have to tell you?

1595
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,200
There will be only one nomination.

1596
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,720
Throw the other forms.

1597
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,480
How did you decide that there's
going to be only one nomination?

1598
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,640
Apart from Rajan, no one's going
to file a nomination.

1599
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:46,680
No body is courageous enough to
nominate themselves against him.

1600
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:54,320
Maybe. There might be someone
new this time.

1601
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,680
Will something that hasn't happened
for so long happen now?

1602
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:00,680
Just a minute, sir.

1603
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:01,640
Hello?

1604
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:06,360
Sir, I was born and brought up here.

1605
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:08,880
I am going to retire
after three months.

1606
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,560
There hasn't been
any election here for 30 years.

1607
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,760
Before I die, I would like to cast
my vote at least once, sir.

1608
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:21,760
But I might die before
this wish is fulfilled.

1609
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,880
Hello.
- Where is Rajan?

1610
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,240
Out of town on business
for work. Tell me.

1611
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,680
I wanted to talk about
the nomination.

1612
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,200
I will call you after he returns.

1613
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:34,480
Okay, all right.

1614
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,520
With the upcoming elections...

1615
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,120
the state is gripped
with political buzz.

1616
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:42,600
Breaking news. There will be
elections in Macharla again.

1617
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,600
The Collector appealed to
the people to submit nomination.

1618
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:49,520
The candidate will be given adequate
security from the government.

1619
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,440
What's wrong with him?

1620
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:53,040
As soon as he took charge, why is
he asking people to invite death?

1621
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,320
It's because he is new.

1622
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,920
Elections in Macharla?

1623
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,600
Democracy? And here?

1624
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:59,280
Grandma, do you want to
nominate yourself?

1625
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,760
Why? So that I can die?

1626
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:13,120
Good morning, sir!
- Morning.

1627
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,440
Hello?

1628
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,360
Narayan, brother Rajan is here.

1629
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,480
It's the last day for the
nomination. Bring the form.

1630
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,600
Okay, I am leaving right away.

1631
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:24,680
Yes, tell him.

1632
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,120
Yes.
- Alright. Okay.

1633
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,680
You have come?

1634
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,480
You said that somebody would file
their nomination.

1635
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,480
Today is the last day, I haven't got
a single nomination.

1636
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,000
You go home and relax.

1637
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,200
I got a work.

1638
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:40,400
I will go to Rajan's house...

1639
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,240
and get him to sign
the nomination papers.

1640
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,280
Why would you go?

1641
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,320
The candidate has to come here.

1642
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,240
He doesn't come.

1643
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,280
We will have to go.

1644
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:47,680
That's Rajan's rule.

1645
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:51,280
He must come to the office
and file his nomination.

1646
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,200
This is the government's rule.

1647
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,320
Government rules are only
on the papers.

1648
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,040
If you follow them,
you end up losing your life.

1649
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:01,120
I don't mind if you suspend me
or dismiss me...

1650
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,600
from my job or even transfer me.

1651
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,680
I am going.

1652
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,800
Bloody rules?

1653
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,680
Who cares about stupid rules?

1654
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,120
Sir?
- Yes.

1655
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,160
I don't have the stature...

1656
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,080
but still I want to say
something. - Go on.

1657
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,280
It's time to fear Siddharth...

1658
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,440
and come out of Rajan's terror.

1659
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,800
Do you want me to die?

1660
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,400
You do your work.

1661
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,160
In a few days,
he is going to leave this place.

1662
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,680
He isn't a coward to
leave this place.

1663
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:30,920
As soon as he came here,
he thrashed Ravi.

1664
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,040
Did you expect it?
- Why go that far?

1665
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,520
Do you remember what happened
when he confronted Rajan twice?

1666
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,520
You know everything.

1667
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,960
Sir, he is an educated man
but he isn't a saint.

1668
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:43,280
I heard that before he became
an officer, he was a goon.

1669
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,400
Sir, look at that.

1670
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,840
He seems to be in
a totally different mood.

1671
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,240
But what does he want to do?

1672
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,880
Thank God he threw
the rod on the rock.

1673
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,280
What if he had hit someone?

1674
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,880
Mr Narayan.

1675
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,440
Come. Let's have a cup of tea.

1676
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,000
Here, have it.
- No thanks, sir.

1677
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,040
It's quite fresh. Have it.

1678
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,320
Sit down.

1679
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,680
Can I say something?
I have a problem.

1680
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:29,440
Generally,
I speak after I use my fists.

1681
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,640
Tell Rajan to come.

1682
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,920
We give him a treat.

1683
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,280
Call him.

1684
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,120
Sir, think again.

1685
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,200
You are too shy.

1686
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:49,760
Oh? Rajan brother God?

1687
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,880
If the devotee calls for God,
won't he make an appearance?

1688
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:53,880
He will come.

1689
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,360
It's ringing. Talk to him.

1690
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,160
Call him.

1691
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,160
Hello! Why didn't you come here yet?

1692
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:06,160
We are running out of time.

1693
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,120
The boss is waiting for you.

1694
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,680
I need to talk to Rajan sir.
Please give him the phone.

1695
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,320
Brother, Narayan is on the phone.

1696
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,520
Yes, tell me, Narayan.

1697
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:06,880
Sir, sign here.

1698
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,960
Congratulations, Mr Narayan.

1699
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,320
At last, you have called him here
and made him file the nomination.

1700
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:29,520
In time.

1701
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,880
I am an MLA even before
you were born.

1702
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,560
You cannot stop me from winning.

1703
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,880
You were talking about elections
and nominations. What happened?

1704
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,520
Not one person came forward.

1705
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,680
I will become
the MLA for the seventh time.

1706
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,840
This legacy will never be stopped.

1707
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,560
Brother, it's Mr Sharma.

1708
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,920
Yes, Mr Sharma.

1709
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,280
Send me the advance.

1710
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,840
The work will be done.

1711
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,240
There was a deal worth
a crore of rupees.

1712
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,040
Here, I am going to be
elected unanimously.

1713
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,560
Both of these things happened
at the same time.

1714
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:07,560
Now you can congratulate me.

1715
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,560
By the way, Mr Rajan!

1716
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:19,840
If there is only one nomination,
the victory is unanimous.

1717
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:22,440
How can it be unanimous
if there are two nominations?

1718
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,800
Look there, not here.

1719
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,040
His nomination form was submitted
a while ago.

1720
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:50,280
Now whom am I going to congratulate?

1721
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,760
Well, between the two of you,
whoever wins, I really don't care.

1722
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,560
The only thing that's important to
me is these elections happening.

1723
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:01,080
Only a lunatic will confront me.

1724
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,240
No matter how fast the deer runs...

1725
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,840
it lives only until
the tiger catches it.

1726
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:04,920
Same conditions apply...

1727
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,200
until you are not in
the reach of my clutches.

1728
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,480
Stop telling me the jungle book
stories in my office. Get lost.

1729
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,360
Rajan! Rajan! I am Rajan.

1730
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,880
He is Narayan.
Murthy. What is your name?

1731
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,120
So what?

1732
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,520
Raising your hand on...

1733
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:21,440
the Collector is equivalent
to raising...

1734
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,360
your hand on the government.

1735
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:32,160
Get lost.

1736
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:47,920
Hello, Raghvendra.
- Hello.

1737
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:49,680
For the first time there is election
in the village.

1738
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,520
On this happy occasion, we are
organizing a fair in our village.

1739
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,880
You must honour us
with your presence.

1740
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,040
Why won't you come?

1741
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,920
I am have phobia of crowd.

1742
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:02,520
I will not come.

1743
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:09,600
Awesome, baby!

1744
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:33,760
"I am fair and beautiful.
I will show you sights of heaven."

1745
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:42,800
"I will set the whole city
on fire with my charm."

1746
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:51,440
"I will make you high
like a liquor."

1747
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:57,160
"I won't spare anyone.
I will floor everyone."

1748
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:04,760
"Be ready. I swim like a fish."

1749
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:09,240
"Be ready. I fly like a butterfly."

1750
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:13,880
"Be ready. I fly like a butterfly."

1751
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,920
"Be ready. I swim like a fish."

1752
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:22,040
"Be ready. I fly like a butterfly."

1753
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,400
"Make merry, my buddy."

1754
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:41,720
"Make merry, my buddy."

1755
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:46,560
"Make merry, my buddy."

1756
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:49,680
Wait. Wait for me.

1757
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,920
"O damsel. Serve me drinks."

1758
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:00,960
"First buy a diamond ring for me."

1759
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,880
"I will buy it for you."

1760
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,440
"Oh so sorry.
First buy me a golden chain."

1761
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:10,560
"You won't get anything,
if you come with an empty pocket."

1762
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:13,560
"It is not your cup of tea."

1763
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,640
"So many admirers wait for me."

1764
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:19,200
"I will give my heart to one
of them. I am so sorry."

1765
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:23,480
"Be ready. I fly like a butterfly."

1766
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:26,760
"Be ready. I swim like a fish."

1767
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,320
"Be ready. I fly like a butterfly."

1768
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,840
"Be ready. I fly like a butterfly."

1769
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,960
"Be ready. I swim like a fish."

1770
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:44,040
"Be ready. I fly like a butterfly."

1771
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:28,160
(Other language)

1772
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:38,880
(Other language)

1773
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:43,240
"Let's exchange hearts."

1774
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:46,320
"This is a deal of love."

1775
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:50,920
"Let's exchange hearts."

1776
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,880
"This is a deal of love."

1777
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:57,800
(Other language)

1778
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:01,520
(Other language)

1779
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:06,040
(Other language)

1780
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:09,360
(Other language)

1781
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,520
Unidentified assailants
have attacked...

1782
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,880
the district collector on
the day of nomination.

1783
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:25,280
Our sources believe this to be
the work of Rajan.

1784
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,560
The district Collectorate issued
a statement that...

1785
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,360
the district collector is unharmed.

1786
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,760
The association of IAS officers have
issued a harsh criticism...

1787
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,360
of the attack on the collector.

1788
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,800
This IAS showed his other side.

1789
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:41,360
You saw that it became
a breaking news, didn't you?

1790
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,480
We cannot do anything now.

1791
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,720
Even what happens in
the bedroom are telecast on the TV.

1792
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:50,640
No political party in...

1793
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:53,320
the opposition would dare put up
a candidate against you.

1794
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:54,760
Everyone knows that.

1795
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,240
Even though we are in power,
we didn't do that either.

1796
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,640
And we will never do that either.

1797
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,160
That is the kind of respect
we have towards you.

1798
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:05,760
But the issue here is that girl.

1799
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,520
I mean Raghav and his granddaughter.

1800
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,800
She went to Vizag
and took this issue to the court.

1801
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,440
If Supreme Court takes cognizance
of your case...

1802
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,400
it will be a problem for you.

1803
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:21,240
Your entire political career
would be jeopardized!

1804
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,720
Once the court starts
dealing with this...

1805
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:27,920
forget about me...

1806
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,280
no one else can do anything
else either.

1807
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,960
And it's the time of elections.
We don't have power right now.

1808
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:39,800
Are you scared that you will lose if
the elections take place?

1809
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:44,920
Can anyone dare to cast their vote
for another candidate?

1810
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:48,480
Please heed my words and this time,
let the elections happen.

1811
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:51,960
I am telling this for your good.
You will surely win.

1812
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,440
I did exactly as you asked.

1813
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,560
Looks like Rajan agreed to
elections taking place.

1814
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,080
That is enough.
I will take care of the rest.

1815
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:07,640
Even though
we were in power all these years...

1816
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:10,120
we were never able to stop
his atrocities.

1817
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:15,240
But looking at you,
I believe that you can stop him.

1818
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,800
Whatever be the case,
the elections must happen.

1819
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,040
My party and my support
is always with you.

1820
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:24,800
All the best.

1821
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,480
Did you back down just
because CM convinced you to?

1822
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,280
You should have killed
that collector the other day.

1823
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,680
The matter would have been closed.

1824
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:37,760
There wouldn't have
been any election.

1825
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:41,680
If we get scared of the law,
people will start opposing us.

1826
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:47,080
Do you want us to go
and beg people to vote for us?

1827
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,840
Hey...

1828
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:55,720
Being a goon and being a politician
are two different things.

1829
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:59,840
To be a politician, you must know
exactly what to do and when.

1830
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,800
Just this once,
let's do as the CM asks.

1831
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:06,320
If anything goes wrong,
we have our ways, don't we?

1832
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,680
I wonder where you are off to.

1833
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,520
The elections are close by, are they
not? I am going to campaign.

1834
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,040
Why?

1835
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,320
It's only through campaign
that people vote for us.

1836
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,160
Ram Kumar, come here.

1837
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,240
Yes, sir.

1838
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,680
Apparently,
they are going to campaign.

1839
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:33,280
Would you vote for them?

1840
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:34,920
Oh goodness, no.

1841
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,720
If I vote for them, Rajan will
kill me. - Understood.

1842
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,200
Go and do your work.

1843
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:41,080
Yes, sir.

1844
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:42,440
Not just him...

1845
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,680
no one in this entire village
is going to vote for you.

1846
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,280
Apparently,
they are going to campaign.

1847
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,520
You are right, uncle.

1848
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,840
Even on collector's behest, people
didn't file for nomination.

1849
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,680
Will they really vote for them
on our behest?

1850
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,880
Thank you, Siddhu. After so long,
you have understood me.

1851
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,280
Narender, looks like
your son changed his ways to ours.

1852
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:12,040
In the current situation, you have
to campaign not among the people.

1853
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:13,960
Then where should we go?

1854
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:17,120
In Rajan's house.

1855
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,720
Narender.
- Tell me, Surender.

1856
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:24,200
What can you see on that wall?

1857
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:26,920
Two photographs.

1858
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,360
But I can see four photographs.

1859
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,960
What's the discussion here?
Won't you tell me?

1860
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:35,640
Five photographs.

1861
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,160
High five.

1862
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,280
The change has begun.

1863
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:16,720
Sir. Even a kid can win if
he plays chess without an opponent.

1864
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:20,280
Only if there is competition...

1865
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,720
one would get to know your talent.

1866
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:28,760
If anyone wants to win against
Rajan, he must be Rajan.

1867
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,880
That's why I don't allow anyone
to compete with me.

1868
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,040
Strange. People are exactly
talking about this.

1869
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:35,480
That elections mean fights,
and riots.

1870
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:36,680
But it won't happen this time...

1871
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,880
Conducting peaceful elections
is our responsibility.

1872
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,640
The only thing important for
a kingdom is a king.

1873
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:57,760
But no king can rule
a kingdom without people in it.

1874
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:05,520
The people should see
their king as their strength.

1875
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,280
But the king should never be
the thing that people fear.

1876
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:12,120
Hi, bro. How are you?

1877
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:16,920
Long time.

1878
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,920
I wanted to say something.

1879
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,280
Mr Raghvendra.

1880
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,520
Come, sir. Sit.

1881
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,120
The latest trend is for opponents...

1882
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,920
in the competition to wish
each other all the best.

1883
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,240
I have brought them here
to follow these trends.

1884
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,600
Is this revenge?

1885
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,760
Revenge?

1886
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:02,400
Bro, are you around
30 to 35 years old?

1887
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,080
Ok, let's assume you
are 35 years old.

1888
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:08,760
Beating up
a man is worth mentioning.

1889
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:11,120
Beating an old man isn't
called bravery.

1890
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,560
There's no revenge here.

1891
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,360
Only election is a must.

1892
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:17,880
Mr Raghvendra,
wish your opponent all...

1893
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,480
the best and start the campaign.

1894
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:22,280
Hey!

1895
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:25,200
I don't need anyone's wishes.

1896
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,120
Everyone with ego is in my life.

1897
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,680
Your campaign is yours
and his campaign is his.

1898
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:33,160
He will ask you to vote for him,
and vice versa.

1899
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:34,560
These are friendly elections, sir.

1900
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:37,080
You are an experienced politician
and he is experienced in life.

1901
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:40,240
Are you scared of elections, sir?

1902
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:41,400
Campaign.

1903
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:44,840
Go ahead and campaign.
Organize meetings.

1904
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:49,560
People here shudder
at the thought about voting.

1905
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:55,440
No one here in this constituency
is going to vote against me.

1906
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,320
That's settled then.

1907
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,520
You campaign with fear,
and he will do it with peace.

1908
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,320
Elections here are being conducted
after 30 years.

1909
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,400
It's only an election in name.

1910
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:07,400
No matter what happens,
the victory is mine.

1911
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,680
Who said otherwise? Please win, sir.

1912
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,080
Wins and losses are not
important to me.

1913
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,360
What matters to me
is the polls being conducted.

1914
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,280
Mr Raghvendra,
please start the campaign.

1915
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,800
Applause! Applause!

1916
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,320
Mr Raghvendra, congrats.

1917
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:39,640
Your election symbol is a torch,
which he has lit.

1918
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:40,800
It's a great start.

1919
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,440
You are super, sir!
Let's go. Come on.

1920
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:52,240
Sir, I have a small request.

1921
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,840
It's not an official matter,
but a family matter.

1922
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,720
He is looking at me
like he wants to kill me.

1923
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,400
Please get him married, sir.
- Please, sir.

1924
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,760
I cannot take that look in his eyes.

1925
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:04,040
Okay, bro.

1926
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:05,520
You get busy with that. Okay bye.

1927
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,760
Get married.
You will learn to see with love.

1928
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,760
Sir, can you please give me
a pen once?

1929
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:21,360
Here.

1930
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,880
The elections are taking
place after 30 years.

1931
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:32,840
Go ahead and campaign.
Organise your meetings.

1932
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,960
The newly appointed collector is
doing a good job. - All the best!

1933
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,680
Rajan agreed to the elections.

1934
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,440
He has agreed to the elections?!

1935
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,400
He asked to vote for
the first time in 30 years.

1936
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:43,080
Rajan agreed to the elections?

1937
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,960
We will also cast vote this time.

1938
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,400
Did you hear?
Rajan spoke of elections.

1939
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:51,960
Looks like Macharla is headed
for good days.

1940
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,040
Why did brother Rajan say so?

1941
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:56,640
These people?

1942
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:57,920
Hello.
- Hello.

1943
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:00,320
What happened? What brings all
the esteemed people here?

1944
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:03,520
After years there will be
elections in Macharla.

1945
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:04,760
All because of this collector sir.

1946
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:05,960
But you deserve all the praises.

1947
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,400
You have revolted against
Rajan's rule.

1948
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:08,360
You are great. From today...

1949
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:10,720
we are going to walk with you
in this fight.

1950
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,080
That's great news.

1951
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:18,200
Welcome.

1952
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:22,160
Brother Raghvendra.
- Long live.

1953
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:24,160
Hail Miss Swati!

1954
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:29,880
Brother Raghvendra.
- Long live.

1955
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:31,440
Brother Raghvendra.
- Long live.

1956
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,760
Brother Raghvendra.
- Long live.

1957
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:37,760
Narender.

1958
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,240
Tell me, Surender.

1959
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,960
Whatever be the case,
your son is truly great.

1960
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:45,240
He is managed to ignite
the doused flame.

1961
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:48,520
Look at the people's passion.
Look at this sort of publicity.

1962
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:51,360
I never imagined such day
would come. - Narender.

1963
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,640
Tell me, Surender.

1964
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:54,040
I was the one who called you.

1965
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:55,960
When did you come?

1966
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,240
What, Gurunath?

1967
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,440
You are shrewd and he is your boss.

1968
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,560
You keep calling each other
Narender and Surender.

1969
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:02,440
No one cares about
how frustrated I am.

1970
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:05,320
What happened?

1971
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,520
Your son stripped me and beat me.

1972
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:09,920
Instead of apologising to me,
he just keeps escaping.

1973
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:12,600
At any cost, I am going to get
an apology from him.

1974
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,160
If I don't get it tomorrow...

1975
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:17,440
I am going to leave this village
and go back home.

1976
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,280
That is when you will know my worth.

1977
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:22,520
These old drunkards are useless.

1978
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,040
Surender and Narender.

1979
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:26,960
I am the Alexander.
The world conqueror.

1980
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,240
Crazy fellow!

1981
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:42,680
It is so noisy outside the house.

1982
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:46,200
But it is so quiet inside.

1983
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:51,640
Should I celebrate
my increasing following...

1984
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,080
or should I mourn...

1985
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,600
as the one I follow doesn't
give me any importance?

1986
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,440
I don't understand.

1987
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:16,080
Brother, because of that old man,
people no longer fear us.

1988
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:21,840
Brother Ravi. Your father is silent.

1989
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:24,440
If it continues, we will be ruined.

1990
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,800
Break everything.

1991
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:38,120
Hey! Raghavendra, come out.

1992
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:42,640
Demolish it. Demolish everything.

1993
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:45,400
Come on. Remove them.

1994
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:48,040
Remove them all.
- Demolish it.

1995
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:49,920
Brother, there is no one inside.

1996
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:52,360
Come out.

1997
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:55,960
Where is that old man?

1998
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:57,880
Where?
- I don't know, sir.

1999
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:07,120
She is the wife of
the old collector.

2000
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:20,400
Tell him and make the list.
- Okay.

2001
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:21,640
What happened, ma'am?

2002
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,520
Those goons are trying to kill us.

2003
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,120
Who is it?

2004
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:27,680
Please save us.

2005
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,080
Come here.

2006
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,640
Ma'am. Please get out of that way.

2007
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,400
Boss, she is running away
in a rickshaw.

2008
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:12,520
Sir!

2009
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,240
Go out.

2010
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:32,840
Everyone go out.

2011
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:48,560
We have started
an investigation sir.

2012
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,760
Why investigation?
We all know who the killer is.

2013
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:51,840
We need witness.

2014
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:53,480
He was murdered in broad daylight.

2015
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,320
Sir!

2016
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:05,160
Nobody saw anything.
No one complains against them.

2017
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:06,200
There won't be any evidence.

2018
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:09,320
If we file a case,
how can we prove it?

2019
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:10,440
It is of no use.

2020
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,520
Send the dead body for post-mortem.

2021
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:29,240
I've only known him for ten days.

2022
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,200
And yet, I feel I lost a friend.

2023
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:33,080
All his life,
he worked only for you.

2024
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:34,920
Someone killed him
right in front of your eyes.

2025
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:37,200
Don't you really have even
a bit of feeling towards this?

2026
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:39,440
Today Ravi's audacity made him
barge into your office.

2027
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:40,760
Tomorrow, he is going
to enter your house.

2028
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:44,440
Something like this is going to
happen to your wife or kids.

2029
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,960
Are you going to just keep staring
and doing nothing even then?

2030
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:52,160
All these days
I thought you were not courageous.

2031
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,240
But there is no human
being inside you!

2032
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:22,800
Sir!

2033
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,080
Somebody came to see you, sir.

2034
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:26,360
Send him in.

2035
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,640
Hello, sir.

2036
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:34,680
My name is Ravinder.

2037
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,720
I am an out-sourcing staff
at the Macharla MRO's office.

2038
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:39,960
Mr Murthy was the one who helped me
secure that job.

2039
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:41,960
I was there when
the incident occurred, sir.

2040
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,360
Sir, I have recorded everything
in my phone.

2041
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:34,720
You said that he wasn't arrested...

2042
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,120
because of lack of evidence
and witness.

2043
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:37,560
Here is the evidence.

2044
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:43,720
He should not be outside.

2045
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:46,080
File the FIR. This is my order.

2046
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:47,600
Sir!
- Hey!

2047
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:49,240
You are making a mistake.

2048
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:51,280
You are making a mistake.

2049
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,560
Yes, brother. I will surely come.

2050
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:15,680
Hello?
- You are coming here?

2051
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,240
Yeah, Uncle.
I will be there tomorrow morning.

2052
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,200
Yes, brother.
We are leaving tomorrow itself.

2053
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,200
Raghvendra is enjoying massive
backing from the public!

2054
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:31,400
The new collector has changed
the youth's opinion.

2055
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:33,080
Sir, all the students have come.

2056
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:35,320
Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir!

2057
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:37,400
Sir, we work
in different locations...

2058
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:40,280
and return home only during
the celebrations.

2059
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:42,480
But this time
we came here for a change.

2060
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:44,960
We have total faith in you, sir.

2061
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:47,080
What should we do to ensure
a fair election?

2062
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,840
We will change our future
with this ink...

2063
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,080
We have to change the society.

2064
02:04:57,160 --> 02:04:59,960
Vote for the change! Hope
for a future! - Yes, sir!

2065
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:01,880
Vote for the change!
Hope for the future!

2066
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:04,920
Please vote. - "Vote is your
right", says the Collector.

2067
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,760
Lay the red carpet at every
polling booth. - Why, sir?

2068
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:50,120
Not for the ones who will wins...

2069
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:51,400
but for the ones who make them
victorious.

2070
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:54,960
Brother, tomorrow we have
the elections...

2071
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:56,840
The collector did
what he claimed to do!

2072
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:58,520
Votes will be cast everywhere.

2073
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:01,200
He gathered all the voters of
the town from various places.

2074
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:04,560
You were too lenient.
It's time to show him your power.

2075
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,840
Beef up the security at every
booth. - Okay, sir.

2076
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:13,520
Hello. - Sir, Rajan is planning
to disrupt the elections.

2077
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,760
Hey! I underestimated you.

2078
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:24,800
Not only the people in the town...

2079
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:27,440
but you have also made
an impact on outsiders.

2080
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:34,160
A 30 years old young chap ended
the 30 years of my terror.

2081
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,960
I will remember it all my life.

2082
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:37,760
There won't be a single vote...

2083
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:41,880
that would be cast in this Macherla
until this Rajan is alive.

2084
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:43,520
If that happens...

2085
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,520
I will commit suicide.

2086
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:51,360
I will kill those people
whom you gave hope.

2087
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:58,280
Hello?
- Swati, where are you?

2088
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:00,280
I am near Durganagar temple.
What happened?

2089
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:02,520
Where is grandpa?
- He is with me.

2090
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:03,480
Okay, stay right there...

2091
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:05,640
I am sending the police force.
- Hello? Siddhu?

2092
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:19,560
Hello?
- Sir! Ravi has escaped.

2093
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:26,680
Sir! They got Ravi out.

2094
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:32,920
What happened? Are you stressed out?

2095
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:36,560
You thought that
I would kill Raghvendra.

2096
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:38,880
30 years ago I did the same thing.

2097
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:41,440
If I repeat it people won't
fear this time...

2098
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,200
they would instead sympathise.

2099
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,920
I already gave you a clue
but you didn't understand that.

2100
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:48,520
I would kill
the ones who trusted you.

2101
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:50,680
I would kill
the ones who listened to you.

2102
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:52,800
I will shatter all your dreams.

2103
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:54,480
I would kill the hope...

2104
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:57,320
that you have given to them.
Do you understand?

2105
02:07:58,680 --> 02:08:01,200
He is going to do something.
He is going to do something big.

2106
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:05,440
What is that message?

2107
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,160
The same thing
that our boys forward...

2108
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:10,720
"Vote for change, Hope for future"

2109
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:16,040
I will break all your hopes.

2110
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:18,880
Do you understand?

2111
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:20,960
What should we do to ensure
a fair election, sir?

2112
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:22,320
Hope for future!

2113
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:24,400
Oh, no!

2114
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:50,600
We will change our future
with this ink...

2115
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,200
We have to change the society.

2116
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,960
Do you think you can cast a vote?

2117
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:16,800
You want to vote?

2118
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,480
Come on.

2119
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:33,040
You want to vote? Tell me.

2120
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:53,280
Sir, we want a change.

2121
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:55,880
What should we do to ensure
a fair election, sir?

2122
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:59,200
Yes, Sir! Vote for the change.
Hope for the future!

2123
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:53,320
The same thing happened
30 years ago.

2124
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:56,200
He didn't kill just one or two.

2125
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:58,440
That wasn't enough for him.

2126
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:01,160
He turned the entire constituency
into a graveyard.

2127
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:05,080
For the election
that comes once in five years...

2128
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:07,920
they have lost the children
who should have been with...

2129
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:09,240
them for another fifty years.

2130
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:11,080
Our lives won't ever change!

2131
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,160
You have done enough, son.

2132
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:17,760
We are happy to have
at least a life to lead.

2133
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:21,080
Nobody will turn up to vote
after witnessing this bloodbath.

2134
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:24,920
Please, go away from here.

2135
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,960
We are sitting here
for no particular reason.

2136
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:13,960
Nobody can to cast
a vote since morning.

2137
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:21,320
No one will come to cast their vote.

2138
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:22,360
We have to wait
for another 3 hours...

2139
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:23,720
and then we can happily leave
for our houses.

2140
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:25,360
We got paid for doing nothing.

2141
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,840
Why did you come here?
- I am here to cast my vote.

2142
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:36,960
You will be killed
if you cast your vote.

2143
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:38,880
I don't care. I will cast my vote.

2144
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,400
Old man! What are you doing here?
- I am here to cast my vote, sir.

2145
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:44,240
You will be killed
if you cast your vote.

2146
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:46,800
Rajan's game is over.
Nobody fears him.

2147
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:01,720
Let's run! Let's vote. Come on.

2148
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:05,920
Come on, let's go! Hurry up.

2149
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,520
Hey, come on!

2150
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:59,600
What happened to your tall claims
of conducting elections?

2151
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,080
And filing nominations?

2152
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:02,640
Isn't your pride crushed?

2153
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:08,320
Hello, collector!
Did people cast the votes?

2154
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,840
If nobody is coming to vote...

2155
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:12,520
you can ask
the corpses to cast their votes?

2156
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:12,160
Hey!

2157
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:14,440
You can do whatever you want...

2158
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:15,520
but you can't wipe off...

2159
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:17,200
the fear that
we have created in the public.

2160
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:20,080
I am Rajan's son.

2161
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:25,320
I have not only inherited his looks
but also his sense of politics.

2162
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:28,760
Until our fear exists
in the people...

2163
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,960
not a single person will cast
a vote in Macharla.

2164
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:43,840
I should kill you right here
and right now.

2165
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:47,560
But I changed my mind. I should
use you to deliver justice.

2166
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:02,520
This is collector Siddharth
speaking...

2167
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:04,120
The voting in Macherla has begun.

2168
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:06,240
Come out of your house
and cast your votes.

2169
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:08,240
I have thrashed Rajan
and he is in a pitiful condition.

2170
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:40,680
What happened? Are you shocked
to see him? He is your son!

2171
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:47,640
I wiped off
the fear that you created.

2172
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:50,880
Do you know
why he is standing in your place?

2173
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:51,880
You are a contestant...

2174
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:53,760
the elections will be postponed
with your death.

2175
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:56,320
I want the elections
to be held today.

2176
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:58,200
Didn't I tell you already...

2177
02:18:58,280 --> 02:18:59,320
that you should contest
the election properly?

2178
02:18:59,400 --> 02:19:00,640
But instead of asking for votes...

2179
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:02,760
you opted for politics
with dead bodies.

2180
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:05,320
What did you say? That not...

2181
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:07,640
a single vote would be cast
until Rajan is alive.

2182
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:10,400
The vote has been cast.
The polling has been completed.

2183
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:15,200
The one who will garner people's
support will become the winner.

2184
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,520
Brother Raghvendra.
- Long live.

2185
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:34,600
Rajan has lost his deposit votes.

2186
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:39,840
After 30 years, Raghvendra has
won with a thumping majority.

2187
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:43,680
Brother Raghvendra.
- Long live.

2188
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:47,880
Brother Raghvendra.
- Long live.

2189
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:52,720
Brother Raghvendra.
- Long live.
