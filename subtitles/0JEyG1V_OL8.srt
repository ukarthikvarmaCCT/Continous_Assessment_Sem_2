00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey everybody. I am Priya and welcome back to my channel Finology Legal.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,600
If there is an article in the whole constitution that is 

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,200
Interpreted most time is article 21.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Why? Because logically speaking, a constitution has to survive

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,266
For decades but as time changes, society's thinking also changes.

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:24,499
That's why the meaning and purpose of article 21 have been interpreted as time passed.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,100
From life to death,alongside food, clothing and shelter,

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,100
There are more basic necessities like freedom, dignity, pollution-free environment 

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,100
And others more like these are all discussed in article 21.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,100
So by discussing article 21, lets understand how

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,733
Meaning of life and person liberty has evolved on a case-by-case basis.

12
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:51,166
Article 21 is available to both citizens and noncitizens states that

13
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:55,166
No one shall be deprived of life and personal liberty

14
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:59,166
Except according to procedure established by law.

15
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:03,166
Article 21 has these three keywords. If we understand

16
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,766
With these three keywords, we will automatically understand article 21.

17
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,466
Let's get started with "Procedure established by law".

18
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:12,866
Article 21 is mainly inspired by American constitution.

19
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:16,866
Their provision states that no person is deprived of life and

20
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:20,866
Personal liberty except according to due process of law.

21
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:24,866
This means that courts have the power to question

22
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:28,866
To control the actions of both legislative and executive.

23
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:32,866
Meaning, those substantive laws that define what should be the laws?

24
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:36,866
Can be questioned. Alongside it, procedural laws that define 

25
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:41,366
How will these laws be implemented and followed? Can also be questioned.

26
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:44,866
So, whichever countries have due process of law 

27
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:48,866
Their courts have the power to ask two questions from their legislature.

28
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:52,366
First, do you have the power to create this law?

29
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:56,366
Second, do these laws comply with the principles of natural justice?

30
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,366
If the answer to both these questions is negative

31
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:04,366
Then the court has the power to declare that part of the law invalid.

32
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:08,366
That's why Dr. B.R Ambedkar wanted article 21 of the Indian constitution

33
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:12,366
Should use this phrase. But Sir Alladi Krishnaswamy Aiyer 

34
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:16,366
Said that if we want to bring new social legislation in future

35
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:20,366
Then this part here will create problems.

36
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:24,366
That's why we used procedure established by law

37
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:29,366
Which only focuses on these. So finally, article 21 used a procedure established by law.

38
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:33,366
That's why up till 1978, we 

39
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:37,366
Only got protection from arbitrary executive action. Meaning

40
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:41,366
Only those executive actions that were not just,fair or reasonable

41
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:43,166
Could be challenged.

42
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:49,366
But, arbitrary legislative action still did not grant us any protection. But all this talk

43
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:53,366
Were up till 1978. Why? Because in 1978,

44
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:57,366
Maneka Gandhi case arose. This case further elaborated

45
00:02:57,366 --> 00:03:00,866
The scope of article 21. So, this was a procedure established by law.

46
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:03,866
Now, let's understand life and personal liberty.

47
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:07,866
We will understand personal liberty through two very important case laws.

48
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:11,866
First, A.K Gopalan vs State of Madras. In this case, what happened was

49
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:16,366
That A.K Gopalan was detained through preventive detention act

50
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:20,366
So he challenged the act and said that this act

51
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,366
Infringes personal liberty. The Supreme court said that

52
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:27,866
Personal liberty is only infringed in two cases.

53
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:32,466
First, if there is a physical restraint, and secondly, in case of coercion.

54
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:35,866
If the case is neither one of these, then your personal liberty

55
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:39,866
Is not being infringed. Isn't it a very narrow interpretation? Yes

56
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:43,866
In this case, personal liberty was very narrowly interpreted.

57
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:47,866
After this, a very important case was "Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India".

58
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:51,866
In this case, the passport of Maneka Gandhi

59
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:55,866
Was impound or ceased by the government without giving any reason.

60
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:59,866
Maneka Gandhi challenged this government action in the supreme court and said that

61
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:03,066
This is an infringement in my personal liberty.

62
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:07,866
In this case, the supreme court said that personal liberty is a very wide concept.

63
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:11,866
It is only infringed by physical restraint and coercion, which is absolutely not the case.

64
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:15,866
So in this case, A.K Gopalan's narrow view was overruled

65
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:19,866
And from here we got a wider definition of personal liberty.

66
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:23,866
Now the supreme court says that if any procedure or

67
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:27,866
Law which curtails personal liberty, that law

68
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:31,866
Should be passed by "Test of reasonable". Meaning

69
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:35,266
That procedure must have to be just, fair and reasonable.

70
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:39,866
This case is also important because after this case, due process of law

71
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:43,866
And procedure established by law had no differences remaining.

72
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,266
Both were being included in article 21.

73
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:50,266
Now, let's talk about "Life". In this single keyword,

74
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:54,266
There are many human rights included like environment, health, dignity 

75
00:04:54,266 --> 00:05:01,066
Livelihood and education. At least 14 to 15 human rights are included in life.

76
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:05,066
In today's video, we will learn about some important case laws that

77
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:09,066
Will help us understand how the supreme court interprets life?

78
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:13,066
Generally, people think that if they have the right to do a certain thing

79
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:16,266
Then they also have the right to deny it.

80
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:20,266
Meaning, if I have the right to live then I also have the right not to live.

81
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:24,266
Meaning the right to die. So, is that right? The very same question was discussed

82
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:27,066
In P. Rathinam vs union of india case.

83
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:31,066
In this case what was that petitioners were

84
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:35,066
About to be punished in IPC under section 309. Because they attempted

85
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:39,066
To commit suicide. They challenged section 309 and said that 

86
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:42,566
Article 21 also gives us the right to die.

87
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:46,566
That's why section 309 should be rendered invalid.

88
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:50,866
Supreme court said that yes, article 21 gives the right to die

89
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:54,866
That's why it should be rendered invalid. But in today's date, the law being followed

90
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:58,866
Was given to us by the Gian Kaur vs State of Punjab case.

91
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:02,866
In this case, the supreme court said that the Indian constitution 

92
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:05,866
Does not allow to weaver from fundamental rights.

93
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,866
So if you have the right to life you can not give it away.

94
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:13,166
Meaning the right to die is not protected in article 21

95
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,366
And section 309 will be valid.

96
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:20,866
After this comes the "Right to privacy".  This does not exist as a separate fundamental right

97
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,499
And we always infer it inside article 21

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,866
The first important case of this was Kharak Singh vs the State of UP.

99
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:33,866
The Supreme court said that the right to life does not merely mean animal existence.

100
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:38,366
If there is any unauthorized disturbance then it is a violation of privacy.

101
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:41,532
After this, PUCL vs union of india case arose.

102
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:45,533
It is also known as the "Telephone tapping case". The supreme court clearly said that

103
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,533
Right to privacy is a part of right to life

104
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,533
And unless there is a public emergency or a case of public safety

105
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:55,866
Then you cannot infringe anyone's right to privacy.

106
00:06:55,866 --> 00:07:00,366
Next in article 21 is right to "Get pollution-free water and air".

107
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:03,866
It's a very interesting case is RLEK vs the State of UP.

108
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:07,866
What happened, in this case, was, Masoorie and Dehradun belt 

109
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:11,866
Were being extensively mined illegally and unauthorized. So, RLEK 

110
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,666
Wrote a letter to the supreme court stating all of this. 

111
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,866
Supreme court treated this as a writ petition. 

112
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:23,866
And by environment protection act ordered all of the illegal mining and excavation

113
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,866
To be halted at once.

114
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:29,866
After RLEK case, M.C. Mehta case and finally t Damodar Rao case,

115
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:34,166
The Supreme court finally said that right to live in a healthy environment

116
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:38,166
Is a part of article 21. Now, let's talk about the impact of emergencies on 

117
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,166
Article 21. So listen, article 359

118
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:46,166
Gives president the power to suspend article 21.

119
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:50,166
That's why a total of three times, during Chinese attack, Pakistan attack

120
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:54,166
And internal emergency, article 21 was suspended.

121
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,166
In A.D.M. Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla case supreme court said that

122
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:02,166
During emergency, article 21 can be suspended. 

123
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:06,166
But then came amendment 44th, which amended article 359.

124
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:10,166
And finally current law is that even in emergency

125
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,366
Article 21 can not just me suspended.

126
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:16,366
I hope this topic of article 21 is clear to you now.

127
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:20,366
Do let me know in the comment section how was my video?

128
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,699
For now, see you in the next video. Bye-bye.
