1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,253
- This is $1 in penny. This is $20.

2
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:05,603
This is $100 in pennies.

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:11,001
That is $1,000 in pennies.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,107
This is $2,000.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,120
This is $10,000 in pennies.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,570
Give or take like five
grand. I stopped counting.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,046
And this is $20,000 in pennies.

8
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:31,349
- Wait, no it's not.

9
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,786
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:34,620
- Alright, now it's $20,000.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,630
So this is $20,000 in pennies.

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,180
We're gonna take these
$20,000 worth of pennies

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,590
and empty 'em on the backyard,

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,180
and Chandler's dad has no idea,

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,013
so when he gets home

16
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,030
there's gonna be $20,000 in pennies laying

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,530
across his entire backyard.

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,240
And then we're gonna help
him pick up all the pennies

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,200
and go buy a car,

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,550
'cause as you're remember
in the slime video,

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,480
he said he needs a car.

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,820
- I bought six cars, all for my kids,

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,170
and I'm the only one without a car now.

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,360
- So yeah guys, let's spread
the pennies across the yard.

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,560
I can't wait to see his reaction

26
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,828
and I can't wait to buy the car.

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,430
Alright, we're officially
gonna start covering

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,690
your dad's yard in pennies.

29
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,590
How does that make you feel?

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,423
- Good.

31
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:12,352
- How do you think your dad's gonna react?

32
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:13,397
- I don't know, honestly.

33
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:14,230
- Yeah? Alright.

34
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,936
- Whoa, that's a whole lot of pennies.

35
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:23,730
- Flashback to Chandler
doin' that to Chris.

36
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,563
- Good luck.

37
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:31,537
Actually, no.

38
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:34,349
- There you go.

39
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,540
We currently have seven
people opening up rolls

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,680
and we have five more coming.

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,780
But even once all 15 people arrive,

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,220
if we're all goin' super hard

43
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,680
there's no way we're even
gonna do like 10% of that

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,240
by the time Chandler's dad gets home.

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,040
Or maybe like 20, 30%,

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,050
but we're not gonna be able
to do like majority of that.

47
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,790
So me and Chris are gonna test some ways

48
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,200
to crack open these roles,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,970
because these are what are taking forever.

50
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,440
It's just really time consuming

51
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,450
to bust them and get
the pennies out of it.

52
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,040
So we're gonna try to
find a more efficient way,

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,450
because if we don't figure somethin' out,

54
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,283
I guess we're just gonna have

55
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:10,650
to lay the rolls out in his
backyard, which is kinda lame.

56
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,930
It'd be so much funnier if
it was just the pennies.

57
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,730
But, I don't know, we're
running out of time.

58
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,140
So now we're gonna see what happens

59
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,090
if we try to burn off the paper.

60
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,710
'Cause maybe we can
just burn the paper off

61
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,543
this whole mound.

62
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,860
Apparently you can't
just burn the paper off

63
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,480
for whatever reason it doesn't burn.

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,580
We got two hours left
till his dad gets home.

65
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,950
We wanted to cover the
entire backyard in pennies,

66
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,880
but they're still wrapped up.

67
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,864
What do we do?

68
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:31,697
Alright, we're really desperate,

69
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:33,000
we're gonna see if this works again.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,467
- I think it's just puttin' the fire out.

71
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,000
- Are you tellin' me firefighters should

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
just use pennies?

73
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,152
- It looks like it, man.

74
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:39,052
- What?

75
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,150
- Yeah, you're definitely
doin' stuff there.

76
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,230
Oh, you're gettin' 'em now.

77
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,700
- I think I am.

78
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,830
How do we unravel all these pennies

79
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,453
before Chandler's dad gets home?

80
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,745
- You havin' fun?

81
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:53,790
- No, just tired.
- I'm breakin' 'em open.

82
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,783
We're desperate.

83
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,620
- What would be good to mash-

84
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:10,940
- Ow, that hit my . Hit that direction.

85
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,797
Garrett's first swing.
- Just straight,

86
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:12,930
"Ow, my !"

87
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,980
- Fired it right at it.

88
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,880
- Yeah, I got hit in the eye.

89
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,083
How do you think I feel?

90
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:23,790
- Feel like this isn't very effective.

91
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,830
- Now we're gonna test the brick method,

92
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,280
'cause the golf club method
isn't really working.

93
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,370
I missed.

94
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,463
- Those look like the Ten Commandments.

95
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,710
- So I think at this rate
we'll cover this whole yard

96
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,543
in about a week.

97
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:39,600
- Yeah, unfortunately we only have

98
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,530
an hour and a half, though.

99
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,573
- Next we're gonna test the car method.

100
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,690
Alright, now let's see. How easy are they?

101
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,660
- Is that a good way to
pop the tire, actually?

102
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,533
- Dude, that tire looks
a little more deflated.

103
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,623
I got my secret weapon on my side now.

104
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,810
- Chandler, what are you doin'?

105
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,010
- Almost helping.

106
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,340
- Remember that time when we
threw a baseball bat at the car

107
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,540
and it almost killed Garrett?

108
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,011
- Yeah.

109
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:12,202
- Watch out.
- Oh.

110
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,720
- If we just had a bunch of pickaxes

111
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,190
this might actually work.

112
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,480
Surprising my friend's dad

113
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,550
with a lot of trash in his backyard.

114
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,080
What do we do?

115
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,310
I wanna surprise your dad

116
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,870
with a bunch of pennies in his backyard.

117
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,021
- I don't know what to do.

118
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:28,660
- I don't either! We're almost outta time.

119
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,180
Do we just leave 'em in the rolls?

120
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,500
Would that make our lives easier?

121
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,810
- It would make our lives 1000% easier.

122
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,100
- But is that what we're about?

123
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,860
- We've got that pile, that pile,

124
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,210
and then a couple in here.

125
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,040
It's currently, what, 3:00?

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,260
- We did this when we
bought the car with pennies

127
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,820
and we knew this would take forever.

128
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,780
- But we did it anyway,
'cause we're ab-so-lute

129
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,220
- Mad lads.
- mad lads.

130
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,560
- Yeah, but how did we know
this would take forever

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,450
and not realize it would take forever?

132
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,120
- Sprinkler.
- Oh my god.

133
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:01,440
- I actually didn't get hit by anything.

134
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,149
- That all hit me right in the head.

135
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:03,982
- I didn't get hit.

136
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:11,647
- Again.

137
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:15,085
- Put this in slowmo.

138
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,050
So we've got a mini army over
there, bustin' up the rolls,

139
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,883
but I really don't think

140
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,360
we're gonna open up all the rolls in time.

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,940
His dad's gonna be home in an
hour, what do we do, Chris?

142
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,860
- Even the greats fail sometimes.

143
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,233
You think Michael Jordan
hit every single dunk?

144
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,413
- Yeah.

145
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,246
- Yeah, I guess you're right. Yeah.

146
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:32,902
I guess you just suck.

147
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:33,735
- Just so you guys understand,

148
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:35,220
we're tryin' to put out multiple,

149
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,410
really crazy videos every single week.

150
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,550
Our videos are so crazy

151
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,260
that we're working on
so many different videos

152
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,960
at the same day so we can do
at least two videos a week.

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,750
I really wanna get all the
pennies unrolled and laid out,

154
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,150
but we just simply didn't have time.

155
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,990
They're still gonna get the money.

156
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,950
They're still gonna get the cars.

157
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,000
The point I'm trying to make is that,

158
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,530
we're just trying to film so many videos

159
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,590
that sometimes it's hard for
every video to be perfect.

160
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,850
And also, his dad gets home in an hour,

161
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,683
so no matter what-

162
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:58,770
- Even if we didn't have videos

163
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,640
for the next four days.
- Yeah, we gotta be done

164
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,720
within another hour.

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,553
- Stick to the end

166
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:03,540
so that way you can see
the dealership's reaction

167
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,373
to the pennies

168
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:06,660
and what car Chandler and
his dad decide to get.

169
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,200
- Can you go back to work?

170
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,033
- Yeah, yeah, can you-

171
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,150
- We weren't done.

172
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,050
- Dad, you need M&Ms to
go with them Cheerio's,

173
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,000
don't you?

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,288
- Yeah.
- What's up, boy?

175
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:26,451
- Oh my goodness.

176
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:27,401
- Aw, he was ready

177
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:28,328
for another sandwich, bro.
- He has it.

178
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:29,161
- You thought he was.

179
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:29,994
- I mean, he's home.

180
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:31,860
I guess we can't keep it a
surprise anymore, let's just.

181
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,162
- All right, yeah, come on.
- Come on.

182
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:34,650
What do you do you think
we're doing at your house?

183
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,780
There's 14 people in
your backyard right now,

184
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,710
what do you think they're doing?

185
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,780
- I thought y'all was gonna
put that slime thing over.

186
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,613
- Yeah, we did.

187
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,330
We did put the slime tank in the backyard.

188
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,350
- I'm not gettin' back in that.

189
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,390
- We just wanted to put
it back there for fun.

190
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,542
Come look at it. Come on.

191
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,270
- Can't see right now.
- You can't see the slime tank

192
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,140
until you get closer.

193
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,700
- Three, two, one.

194
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,603
- Surprise.

195
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,440
- What the man?

196
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,760
- We were gonna put a bunch of pennies

197
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,780
in your backyard, but we couldn't

198
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,310
- You did.
- unroll them in time.

199
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,330
So we were gonna take 'em back,

200
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,440
but then you still came back.

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,280
So now we don't know what to do.

202
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,740
So there's a bunch of rolled
up pennies in your backyard.

203
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,120
- I think we could just leave it here

204
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,953
for you, right?

205
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,893
We don't have to clean 'em up anymore.

206
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:10,235
- You can take 'em to the bank for me.

207
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,210
- We were gonna unroll 'em all

208
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,250
and cover your entire
backyard in pennies, but-

209
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,083
- Apparently it takes a long time.

210
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,770
- It takes longer than 10 hours,

211
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,120
- Oh my god.
- which we didn't know.

212
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,461
But you have a lot of pennies now.

213
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:20,428
- Oh, I getta keep 'em?

214
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:22,327
- Yeah.
- We're gonna get a car.

215
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:23,700
- With pennies?
- With pennies, yeah.

216
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,620
It would've made so much more sense

217
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,460
- They have pennies there?
- if they were just laid out.

218
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,596
This is a dollar.

219
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,936
- I'll make sure I get
at least $1 outta this.

220
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:30,930
- 5 bucks in a box, right?
- How many pennies do you

221
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,377
think were in your backyard?

222
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:33,527
- $1000.

223
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,980
Times?

224
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,813
- 10?

225
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:37,020
- Keep on goin'.
- A little bit warmer.

226
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,106
- For real?

227
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:38,939
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

228
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:39,772
- There's 21,000 here.

229
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,107
We were gonna surprise
you with them, but...

230
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,113
- $21,000 worth of pennies?

231
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,143
- Yessir.
- Yeah.

232
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,410
- We called the dealership,

233
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,363
they said they would
just take the pennies.

234
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:48,600
- They're gonna come get 'em?

235
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,010
- No, you load 'em up

236
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,450
and just go buy cars right now.

237
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,740
Whatever you and Chandler want.

238
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,573
- For real?

239
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,406
- Yeah. Sure.

240
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,633
- yeah. Dude, that's awesome, man.

241
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:00,466
- Yeah?

242
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:01,299
- Hold up.
- The fact that-

243
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,812
Awe. Yeah, look at that.

244
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:03,691
- There we go, man.

245
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,752
I'm gonna have a whip.
- Alright, let's get back

246
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:05,585
to loadin' 'em up.

247
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,442
I find it hilarious that
you thought it was slime.

248
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:08,820
- I really did.

249
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,740
Yesterday I'm like, oh god, you know what?

250
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,110
They said whoever won that
thing, they wanted to slime 'em.

251
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,490
- Y'all are some good people, Chris.

252
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,900
- Yes, sir. What do you think about it?

253
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,640
- I've been havin' to get
a ride of class every day

254
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,900
'cause he's usin' my car.

255
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,733
- Uh huh.

256
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,230
- So now that he has
his own, let's get it.

257
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,100
- What do you think about it?

258
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,360
- I think it's awesome.

259
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,193
- Mid chew there.

260
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:26,430
- Mr. Beast is a good guy.

261
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,480
- There you go.
- I'm glad I get to sit back

262
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,410
and watch what he does.

263
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,720
- Finally gettin' me a ride. Yes I am.

264
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,067
- You gonna get you a ride?

265
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,967
- yeah, dude. That's crazy.

266
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,523
- I got that.

267
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,750
- This just looks like pennies,
what it is is a new car.

268
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,583
- It's a new car?

269
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,940
- This sure is, brother.

270
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,400
- Who's your favorite president now?

271
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,763
- Jimmy. Mr. Beast is.

272
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:54,270
I actually got enough money
to get me a sweatshirt now.

273
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,650
I can get me some merch now.

274
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,170
- Some of that shopmrbeast merch.

275
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,150
- Good boy, man.
- Yeah?

276
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,170
- So I bet you didn't know havin' a son

277
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,370
would get you hooked up, did it?

278
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,240
- Finally paid off.
- Just have your son

279
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,306
work for a YouTuber.

280
00:09:04,306 --> 00:09:05,280
- Right. Yeah.
- Hey, usually

281
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,890
havin' a child is really expensive.

282
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,120
- You guys should have children

283
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,637
so they can become friends with YouTubers

284
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,120
so you can get cool stuff.

285
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,510
Also, both of you guys lost
the slime video, so this is...

286
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,905
- This is redemption.
- This was worth it.

287
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:18,281
Dude, I can't believe this.

288
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,931
I can't believe this, boy.

289
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:21,240
- How long has it been
since you've had a car?

290
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,620
- So it's been six months.

291
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,507
I've been borrowin' Hannah's car

292
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:25,590
to get to work in the
mornin', come back home,

293
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,060
then take Zach's car to work.

294
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,250
Or they drop me off, I gotta
ride back with Uncle John.

295
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,390
It's been a pain in the butt.

296
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,470
- You picked out your car yet?

297
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,640
- Uh uh.

298
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,473
- You should probably do that.

299
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,360
- Oh yeah. In about 20 minutes
we're gonna go buy a car.

300
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,740
- Cool.
- You kinda gotta pick one.

301
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,381
- I haven't given you a hug yet, so.

302
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:40,722
Awe.

303
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:41,880
- Dude, it's just crazy.

304
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,470
I swear, man. I don't even know.

305
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,343
No, I did not expect none of this.

306
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:46,590
Dude, I thought I was
gettin' kicked outta my house

307
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,091
when I pulled up and saw the U-Haul.

308
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,610
Chris finally got rid of me, man.

309
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,528
- It's good content, so we all win.

310
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:53,361
- Yeah.

311
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:54,393
- I definitely won.

312
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,880
- I drank one of your drinks. Here you go.

313
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,960
- Hey.

314
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,830
- Oh, yeah. Actually-

315
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,700
- Root beer?

316
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,660
- Yeah, your root beer.

317
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,860
- I also ate some of your M&Ms.

318
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,300
- You can have your dollar back.

319
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,133
- Oh, thank you.

320
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:06,257
- Get me another quarter, though.

321
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:07,090
- You wanna help us?

322
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,430
- Heck no, I got a bad back, man.

323
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,330
I'm tryin' to recoup.

324
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,163
- He's rich.

325
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:11,760
Rich people don't have
to pick up their money.

326
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,630
- Boom.
- You know what, you're right.

327
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,980
- I'm glad this worked out really good.

328
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,840
- This worked out really good. Trust me.

329
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,250
- For you.
- Yes it did.

330
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,480
- Hey, when's my pennies

331
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,770
in the backyard video, though?

332
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,300
- Stay tuned.
- Stay tuned.

333
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,140
- It's comin' up.

334
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,180
- So I'll give you guys a
little behind the scenes peek

335
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,500
of one of our videos.

336
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,050
This is usually the
amount of people it takes

337
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,980
to do these videos.

338
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,160
15 if you include me. 16 of
you include Chandler's dad.

339
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,330
Just movin' pennies.

340
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,750
Some of our videos literally
require an entire army.

341
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,040
We can do it on our own,

342
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,440
but if we wanna upload two
to three videos a week,

343
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
there's just no way.

344
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,140
'Cause this would literally
take us about two weeks

345
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,583
if we did it ourselves.

346
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,400
So we just finished
picking up all the pennies

347
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,050
and we put 'em in all of these boxes.

348
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,720
As you'll see, these
boxes are full of pennies.

349
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,090
We're gonna take all these
boxes to the dealership

350
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,130
and hopefully they give us a car.

351
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,280
We just got done surprising
Chandler's dad with the pennies.

352
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,660
And now we're gonna go to the dealership

353
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,790
and buy him and Chandler
whatever they want.

354
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,990
So let's talk strategy.

355
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,690
You guys could buy two $10,000 cars,

356
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,520
you could buy one $20,000 car,

357
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,780
you could put $20,000 down on
a car, $10,000 on two cars,

358
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,020
or you could just spend
it all on groceries.

359
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,860
What's the game plan?

360
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,790
- Groceries.

361
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,623
- Groceries?

362
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:27,630
- I'm gonna spend $10,000
on a down payment.

363
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,490
- Okay, so you're gonna put
10 grand on down payment.

364
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,810
So what are you gonna do
with the other 10 grand?

365
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,550
- I'm gonna try to get a car for 10 grand.

366
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,690
- Alright. That's the game plan.

367
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,340
He wants to put 10 grand down on a car.

368
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,900
He wants to buy a car for 10 grand.

369
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,130
Let's go see if we can make it happen.

370
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,660
Hopefully they take the pennies.

371
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,160
- So when I got home from work today,

372
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,890
and even after I saw all
those pennies in the yard,

373
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,723
- Yeah?
- I'm like,

374
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:45,930
yeah, it was a mess in my yard.

375
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,862
I'm like, oh we actually
get to keep these pennies?

376
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:49,710
- Yeah.

377
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,881
Well, when I told Chandler
I was gonna prank you,

378
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:53,550
Chandler was like, "Okay."

379
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,930
And I was like, "You get to keep 'em."

380
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,250
He's like, "Oh wait, what?"

381
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,150
Hey Chris.

382
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,983
- Hey, what's up?

383
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:58,816
- Hey.

384
00:11:58,816 --> 00:11:59,649
- Where are you guys goin'?

385
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,380
- We're going to get Chandler a car.

386
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,580
- No way, me too.

387
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,805
- Oh, I'll see you there.

388
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,190
- Alright.
- Hey, don't forget me!

389
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,450
- Oh, Chandler's dad a car.

390
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,740
I keep forgetting this is about you.

391
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,573
- Yes.

392
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:09,540
- That's the manager of the store.

393
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,520
Yeah, we returned a
destroyed rental car here

394
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,870
and we also bought a car from here.

395
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,760
Oh, and then we also
smashed my friend's car

396
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,630
and bought it from here.

397
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,539
Chand, come show us your new car.

398
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,830
Oh, look at this.

399
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,110
- My interior's black
and white. I love it.

400
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,390
- Whoa. That's actually
a pretty good interior.

401
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,710
- Isn't that nice?

402
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,133
- Dude, it's got the two tone.

403
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,273
It's got the new car smell.
- Sir, do you need help?

404
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:30,750
- No, I'm okay, man.

405
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,071
- Dude, I love the interior.

406
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:32,951
- Dude, it does look pretty dope.

407
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:33,989
- Yeah, this is a nice-

408
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:36,360
- What I wanna do is make it
matte black on the outside.

409
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,790
Dude, I've never bought a new car before.

410
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,736
- Really?

411
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:40,569
- Yeah.
- It's a fun experience.

412
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:42,300
- This is Chandler's special moment.

413
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,370
He's about to drive
his new car on the road

414
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,620
for the first time.

415
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,453
- Yeah.

416
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:47,383
- Dude, what if you got in a wreck?

417
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:48,602
- What if he just starts-
- Oh .

418
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,751
- Oh gosh.
- What the ?

419
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:50,584
- What is she doin'?

420
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,221
- You almost did get in a wreck.

421
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,054
- It's not meant to be.

422
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,720
- Chand's like, what did you say, Chris?

423
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,002
- You want me to hit him? Okay.

424
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:56,835
Sure. Whatever.

425
00:12:58,518 --> 00:12:59,435
- Oh, yeah.

426
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,563
- Oh, this is my jam!

427
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,013
So how much is this, Chris? This is 4,650?

428
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:14,220
4,650 are still in the boxes.

429
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,390
Are you the accountant?

430
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,530
- This is our accountant right here.

431
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,363
- Sorry.

432
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,210
- Y'all are gonna help, right?

433
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,951
- Do you have experience
with counting pennies?

434
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:20,886
- Yeah, nah,

435
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:21,796
I haven't done it man.
- You got kids, right?

436
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:25,392
- Yeah, I've got two kids.
They're gonna help too.

437
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:26,760
- Okay. Perfect.

438
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,930
- Yeah, there you go, brother.

439
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,007
- Money's money, right?

440
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:29,840
- That's right, brother.

441
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,709
Money's money.
- We're buyin' two cars.

442
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:32,961
How do you like your car?

443
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:33,794
- I like it.
- Yeah?

444
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:35,640
- Brother Todd, what have you done

445
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,034
with that nice whip?

446
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:37,867
- It's not bad, is it?

447
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,482
- It's not bad at all, man.

448
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:42,450
You've even got the wood interior, man.

449
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,970
- These seats are cool,
air conditioned seats.

450
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,950
- You be ridin' in style, man.

451
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,330
- Yes, sir.
- Look at this thing.

452
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,427
You gon' pull up to the bingo
place like you own it, man.

453
00:13:51,427 --> 00:13:53,343
- Yes, sir. Ridin' in style, baby!

454
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,013
- Hey Jake.

455
00:13:58,013 --> 00:13:59,543
- What's up man? I like your car.

456
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:02,310
- Thanks. My brand new car
and my brand new Beast merch.

457
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,400
- Hey, that stuff looks fire.

458
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,790
- Isn't this car amazing?
I love it so much.

459
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,320
And my dad really loves his car.

460
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,750
And I just wanna say thank
you again for the car.

461
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm gonna drive it every day of my life

462
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,660
for the rest of my life.

463
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,040
- Every day?
- For the rest.

464
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,292
- Forever?
- Forever.

465
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,125
- And ever?
- And ever.

466
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,043
- And ever?
- And ever.

467
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:19,161
- Hey.
- That's a good horn.
