1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,120
imagine living in scorching heat with no

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,480
access to food water or electricity

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,640
while constantly fearing for your safety

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,320
this is a saddening reality for the

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,960
people that live in this remote Village

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,840
in Zambia where locals are forced to

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,040
rely solely on natural resources to

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,199
survive and due to isolation from any

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,119
City and no access to light during the

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,760
nights many children are left to

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,199
navigate in complete darkness making it

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,240
extremely dangerous as there is a high

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,359
crime rate in the area this only became

14
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,359
evident to us 6 months ago when a woman

15
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,519
named Dora Muno sent us this Tik Tok

16
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,040
pleading for our help be philanthropy

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,239
please please help me save our village

18
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:38,000
our kids need you I immediately sent

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
Darren there to find out what we could

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,399
do to help Dora and her

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,760
community upon his arrival Darren

22
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,520
received an extremely warm welcome from

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,680
the

24
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,079
children hi Dora how are

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,520
you I came to my papa village where we

26
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,520
are right now in 2019 I started to

27
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,199
notice that some of the kids they

28
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,359
experienc horrible situations just

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,280
having that constant threat on your life

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,640
is terrible I felt very cold to come

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
back and do something so within a year

32
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,000
Dora packed up her life along with her

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,040
already adopted four children and moved

34
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,360
from luaka to mapapa to start building a

35
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,159
village to rescue as many children as

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,759
possible and the first thing I did was

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,079
build a mud hut and my kids and I lived

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,159
in the mud hut the kids would use my

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,159
house as classroom during the day and

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,200
then at night we would use it at a house

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,960
but when the rainy season came it got

42
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,079
washed away this forced Dora to turned

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,000
to Tik Tok for help the very first day I

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,960
posted I did not get any views at all it

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,200
took one song and that small video

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
helped me to have my first follower

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,479
which I moved from one to close to 4.5

48
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,880
million this on its own is an incredible

49
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,960
feed especially without any access to

50
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,360
electricity or reliable cell reception

51
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,799
as you can see there's barely any

52
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,799
connectivity out here well there is

53
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,880
actually one way every time I have to

54
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,520
post out here I have to hold my phone up

55
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,560
for close to 30 minutes depends can I

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
track my phone I got to download some

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,920
cat videos I don't know if it's working

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,640
just a little bit longer oh can you get

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,680
a signal hold it don't move it is it

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,519
working okay good we're done to hold it

61
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,879
like that it is she is doing all of this

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,519
solely to generate income through

63
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,440
donations to expand this Village we've

64
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,800
rescued 350 kids we provide good

65
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,200
education for them we provide meals for

66
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,080
them just for them to experience a

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,040
different lifestyle from what they know

68
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,800
but the cost of maintaining this school

69
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,840
have become increasingly expensive and

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,120
impossible to sustain meaning it won't

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
be long until the school will have to

72
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,480
close down it became evident that the

73
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,360
lack of electricity was holding them

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,720
back and severely curtailing Dora's

75
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,920
ability to help develop this Village to

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
what its potential could be having to

77
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,680
wake up and thinking what will these

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,840
kids eat that is still very difficult to

79
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,800
do each and every day so we came up with

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
a plan to use the direct sunlight and

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,680
scorching heat to our advantage by

82
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,599
installing a massive solar grid that

83
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,800
will provide electricity to the entire

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,760
Village while we've worked on even more

85
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,720
ways to grow this Village and surprise

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Dora with the team along with our

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,000
amazing Partners at give power spent the

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,720
next few months secretly building this

89
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,080
solar

90
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,920
plant again I want to emphasize how we

91
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
would never have been able to pull this

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
off in time without give power after

93
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,920
months of planning and a lot of hard

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,000
work I'm pading the last Bol in the

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Solar Ray we're finally

96
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,680
done as you can see behind me the sun is

97
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Now setting and in a little while we're

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,080
going to be turning on the lights for

99
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,159
the very first time and from now on the

100
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,319
kids will no longer experience Darkness

101
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,060
at

102
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,720
[Music]

103
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,560
night the moment has finally come we're

104
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
just about to turn on all the lights

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Mato the electrician is waiting in the

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,879
container and I'm going to radio him and

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,720
give him the go ahead M turn on the

108
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,560
nice and we have

109
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,000
light

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,360
yeah to witness these children's

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
reaction to light such a simple

112
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,560
necessity was incredibly

113
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,759
humble oh it was a joy it was a sight to

114
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,680
behold and we're very grateful to be

115
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,240
philanthropy for that but we weren't

116
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,199
done just yet there's barely any water

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,919
in the water that they have is not

118
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,120
Quality Water this is one thing that

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,560
electricity just cannot solve and with

120
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,680
the extreme heat could be fatal as they

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,639
only have one tiny pump that lasts for

122
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,120
30 minutes per day and 350 kids and 84

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,440
staff have to be taken care of by this

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
little water and that's including the

125
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,120
water that they need to be able to cook

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,160
fresh food so every day I will have to

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,080
then get into my car which will either

128
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,960
start that day or it won't start that

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,160
day then from there if it does run

130
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,039
she'll have to do a 2-hour round trip

131
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
just to get cold water but Darren is

132
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
about to surprise door about how this is

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,720
all going to change after to I've seen

134
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,080
everything that you've done here what

135
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,199
you're doing with these kids we decided

136
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,919
we're also going to do a hydrological

137
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,440
study and we're going to give you a

138
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,759
proper well a professional deep deep

139
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,120
well so that you're never going to have

140
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,759
to worry about water again we're going

141
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,800
to install an electric water heater in

142
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,479
the kitchen a commercial gas stove and

143
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,960
we're going to more than triple Your

144
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,639
Capacity in solar production okay thank

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,600
you it's been a dream come true honestly

146
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
so that is amazing so thank you so much

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,680
you're teaching all of these kids to be

148
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,600
empowered and stand up for themselves

149
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,560
and you're going to change society here

150
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,080
cuz they're going to grow they're going

151
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,960
to raise their families this way they're

152
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,520
going to spread the message that you're

153
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,479
teaching them you're planting seeds

154
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,400
because they love you as much as we do

155
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,319
but obviously doing more would incur a

156
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,280
much bigger expense so we reached out to

157
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,400
