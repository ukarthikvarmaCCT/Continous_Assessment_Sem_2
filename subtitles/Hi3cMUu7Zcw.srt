The patient won’t come to a Doctor

00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,484

Where did you plan the
operation theater?

34
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,641
On the first floor, sir

35
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:41,982
I told you to plan it on
the ground floor, Change it

36
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,181
Bring it to the ground floor
–it’s to late, sir

37
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:45,913
Construction work has
already commenced

38
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,723
But before the construction work
Has begun, in the final plan…

39
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:53,294
The operation theater was supposed
to be on the ground floor

40
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,632
Some complication had cropped
up and you were not available…

41
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:58,100
But Mr.Chaturvedi
asked me to go ahead

42
00:02:58,305 --> 00:03:01,010
Who is Chaturvedi?
Go and get me Mr.Chaturvedi

43
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,360
From the very begining
I been telling you,

44
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:07,030
I want this Operation theatre on the
ground floor and you..

45
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:15,465
It’s me – Me, who?
Me! – Oh, well …go ahead

46
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:19,111
I was taking a bath this morning
And you left without telling me

47
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:22,565
I told you I was In hurry, Is
this why you’ve called me?

48
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:28,294
I have drawn a sketch, I want you
to see it, Will you come for lunch?

49
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:32,000
I could also have seen the
sketch in evening…You…

50
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,265
Yes Sir -One second

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,496
Did you tell him to shift the
operation theater to the first floor?

52
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:40,941
Yes, sir -Why?

53
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,750
I thought it wouldn’t
make a difference

54
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:48,383
What do you mean by that? As
a doctor, don’t you know…

55
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:52,409
A patient could have loose his life during
an emergency? -I am sorry sir

56
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,770
Keep the plan with you
and let’s go to the site

57
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,805
Sunil, so many Indian doctors
have settled in the U.S.

58
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,702
Why mustn’t I do the same thing?

59
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,538
I think he is right, Sir
-Thank You

60
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:12,820
Really? but the doctors
think like this…

61
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:17,315
What will happen of India? -what
can you find here anyway?

62
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:24,615
If I settle down there, I’ll get
a lot more money and facilities.

63
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:32,310
And here we are facing
population explosion

64
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:34,812
If the population is more,
more people will be ill

65
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:38,582
If the people are ill, more
doctors will be required

66
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:44,821
And lady, here you can’t get
your work done by servants

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,662
Out there, you will have to
do everything on your own

68
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:51,970
Not right away, We have
just arrived, You may eat

69
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,405
That’s good, in fact

70
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,024
One need not go on a diet

71
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:02,321
What are you doing? I have just started
This is my second drink

72
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:04,034
Guys, this is my second drink, right?

73
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,976
Go ahead and eat. And
it’s only 10pm

74
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,316
What are you going
to do at home?

75
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,631
You don’t want to show
me a new sketch, do you?

76
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:14,079
Sketch?
- Oh Yes, Of late, she’s is very much

77
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,221

the hospital, she rang me up

78
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,674
I asked whether it was important

79
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,440
She said yes
“I got to show you anew sketch”

80
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,708
I have seen her paintings
a couple of times

81
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:27,681
I didn’t know which
side to look it from

82
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,915
Left, Right, Top or bottom? it
looked the same from everywhere

83
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,555
Are you angry with me?

84
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:09,991
What’s up? You are so quite,
You just don’t speak

85
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:17,659
If you don’t wish to talk,
May I get a book for you?

86
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,925
Write all your complaints in that
Complaints from me?

Why not? she is my sister in law,
means half wife

170
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:30,866
Half Wife, tell same to Sunil,
he will shoot you

171
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,913
In salim's arm

172
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,028
Anarkali will be bride of Hindustan

173
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,591
Don't make dust of earth,
crown of head

174
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,107
It is already done

175
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:06,593
I can see the Hindustan of
King Akbar

176
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,124
Will accept you

177
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:18,095
If King see me here, I will be
buried in your arms

178
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:23,924
Love which is afraid is not love,
It's crime

179
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:29,930
Salim, Your fearless love

180
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:33,928
Challange to Moghal Empire

181
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:36,055
Inspector

182
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:37,446
What happened? Where is he?

183
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:40,306
Arrest this girl

184
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:44,066
No, This is not possible,
till I am alive

185
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Your impossible attempt,
is disobey of royal order

186
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:57,293
I can't see this crime
-Stand up

187
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,981
If you love this servant

188
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:04,668
Than you will have to try,
your full life

189
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:09,153
Anarkali is not fit for you

190
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:10,721
Why Not?

191
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:16,791
Because, for your love, can not change
destiny of Hindustan

192
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:20,839
Everything changed

193
00:21:21,283 --> 00:21:23,470
But in this changing world

194
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:28,189
You can not change your love

195
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:32,948
But, Salim you have to change

196
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:41,438
Aarti -Yes
-Aarti never loses

197
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:45,079
You have done wonderful job
-You have done excellent

198
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:48,141
You are good in dialouge
-What differnce it makes

199
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:51,658
Many times you can express
youself without saying anything

200
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,886
You have said nothing but did
a good job -Thank You

201
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:07,776
You did good job

202
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,948
Vinod, even today you could not
tell her your feelings

203
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:21,055
You speak well on stage, If you could speak
in real life, your work would have done

204
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,055
Uncle, I think today I should tell her

205
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:31,031
Now love her in your dream,
-What do you mean

206
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:34,016
I mean, her marrige is fixed

207
00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:03,233
Isn't it good place

208
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:11,786
In wet rain, in green hills,
train looks so beautiifull

209
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:14,483
God knows, how many stories
hidden in it

210
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:18,734
Everyday so many passnger traval
through this

211
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:21,229
To take others to their
destination is its destination

212
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:27,171
What are you thinking?

213
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:31,420
You deliver dialogue very well

214
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,906
Seems the habit of acting is not gone

215
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:38,984
How it can go, every person is actor,
you me we all

216
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,542
In drama of life everybody
has to do their role and go

217
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:48,246
Yes, sound good -It's a fact

218
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:56,927
Why you lauged
-It remind me college insident

219
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,646
Do you remember you used
to deliver items on stage

220
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,099
I used to do lot, which one
you talking about

221
00:24:12,804 --> 00:24:17,928
Yes Mr. & Mrs. Laila Majnu
-Yes I got it

222
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:20,929
Laila Majnu are married now

223
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:26,806
It was their wedding night
With procession of mad people

224
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:34,526
Majnu says, come in arms

225
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:43,661
Laila said first sew your torn cloths

226
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:50,533
Love was dream, come into reality,
It seems got into trouble

227
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:54,118
The question of earning started

228
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:57,805
reminded of bread when felt hungry

229
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,735
Laila used to ask when Majnu
reaches home

230
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:10,078
Even today we have come empty handed,
No ladyfingar, no cabbage, no pumpkin

231
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:14,842
There is no chilli and no masala,
You put me in trouble

232
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,671
Laila do you want fight with me,
we have promised to love each other

233
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:27,178
Shall I wear it or spread it your love,
what shold feed to our hungry kids

234
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:33,221
Don't cry, till Majnu is alive
you don't have to worry

235
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:36,158
This is Doctors Majnu’s house

236
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:37,533
-Who is Majnu?

237
00:25:37,732 --> 00:25:40,385
I am sorry, this is doctor’s
Sunil’s house

238
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,797
What’s the matter?
You sound very happy

239
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,578
No, that Majnu was…
- who is the Majnu?

240
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:57,885
What I meant is that Vinod

241
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:05,823
Why didn’t you tell me about it?
Doesn’t matte, Why did you call?

242
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:11,056
Oh yes, I want to renew
My revolver license

243
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:16,620
I looked eveywhere but couldn’t
findit, Could it be in you bag?

244
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:35,728
Yes, I have it

245
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,217
-Have it! You could have atleast
Told me before leaving

246
00:26:38,518 --> 00:26:43,370
That give you a reason to call
-I was going to call you anyway

247
00:26:43,698 --> 00:26:47,151
Listen, I told you yesterday
About Raju’s birthday

248
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:50,508
Why don’t you come over? Sister
and brother in law would

249
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:53,446

What do you mean by trying?

250
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,571

254
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:14,365
Every morning brings new exaltation,
Gives message of good news

255
00:27:15,724 --> 00:27:19,818
You are having tea in Glass? -Cup
-I like tea in glass

256
00:27:20,787 --> 00:27:23,921
becuse first you get more tea in it,
secondly it remains hot for longer

257
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:27,399

258
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,237
Sister, this time we will celebrate
Raju's birtday here

259
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,580

00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:34,612
It's OK, but -Yes Aunty

261
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:40,256
But your house is not ready yet
-Don't worry, it will be ready by evening

262
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:48,973
Come on Raju, Come on Raju..

263
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:57,338
Come on Raju, Come on Raju..

What's going on? -Blink an eye
-Means?

265
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:05,479
War of an eye, The one who will
blink an eye first will lose the game

266
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,119
And the one who will lose?

00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:50,631

295
00:30:50,788 --> 00:30:58,365
"They laugh even when broken"

296
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:06,216
"Who laugh in such style,

297
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:09,833

00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:21,687

"Speak, speak, life's gamut"

313
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:48,706
Wait, I will just ask Mrs. Sunil Gupta
and let you know

314
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:54,692
I can not stand anymore, Sister
-But

315
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,066
Sunil was not like that

316
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:04,172
He was not, but now a day he
is so much lost in his own work

317
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,255
He has no value fore me

318
00:34:06,636 --> 00:34:08,276
As if I do not exist

319
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,707
What are saying, Sunil has given
you everything

320
00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:15,770
Car, Bunglow...
- I did not ask for all these

321
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:20,596
Sister, I'm not one of those women

322
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:25,002
Who are satisfied with all these

323
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:30,706
I just wanted his love, his company

324
00:34:32,214 --> 00:34:35,605
We were so happy in that small house

325
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,121
As wealth grows,
happiness gets away from me

326
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:45,180
And the distance between us kept growing

327
00:34:45,837 --> 00:34:50,508
It was heard that after marriage,
the two get together

328
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:57,626
But, we two remain two

329
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:02,413
It was good to be alone

330
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:07,184
No aarti, Don't feel so bad about it

331
00:35:09,217 --> 00:35:12,576
Sister, you won't understand

332
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:19,001
The one who feels lonely knows

333
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:21,308
What she goes through

334
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,532
You don't worry, this time
I personally come with you

335
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:28,574
and explain Sunil

336
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:32,901
No sister, that is of no use

337
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:36,996
He should understand himself,
my pain

338
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:39,164
I have decided

339
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:47,728
Unless he come himself and take
me with him, I won't go from here

340
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,615
Rosy, Did you change it's location?
- No Sir

341
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:59,897
If I change, madam will replace me
and send me to Goa

342
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,924
So did it move by itself
-I think so -What?

343
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:08,159
No Sir, Madam told watchman to keep it here

344
00:36:14,857 --> 00:36:16,810
Bahadur

345
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,263
Get Ladder -I won't

346
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:25,404
Why? -Once I climb the ladder
One person took away ladder

347
00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:28,402
Full day I was on top and
The mosquito ate me

348
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:32,716
If you want I can get small table
-OK get that -I will get that

349
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:43,618
Sister, can we go for picnic tomorrow?
- Not picnic, will go to see film

350
00:36:43,712 --> 00:36:47,946
No mom will go to see Circus
-Not at all -In circus there are lions

351
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,192
No, No... there is lot of confusion

352
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:53,941
We will make slips -wonderfull

353
00:36:54,051 --> 00:37:01,004
See in slip we will get Picture only

354
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:10,023
Tell me what yours, spell the circus
Whereyou want to go?

355
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:16,905
Picnic -Aunty Circus -You?

356
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:19,702
No mama circus -Keep quiet, You?

357
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:24,786
I wanted to go for hunting, but
will go where my wife want to go

358
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:30,020
Film -Major will go to see film,

359
00:37:32,623 --> 00:37:36,388

partner you select -Circus

362
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:48,048
Well done, ley me read

00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:53,903
Let us see awesome slip
What is it? It's Picnic

364
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,044
Look, it's picnic -We lost hunting
as well as film

365
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:07,914
If we are going for picnis, why don't
we go to Nandgaon? -Will go to Bhushi Dam

366
00:38:12,716 --> 00:38:17,200
Hunting, Hunting, you know anything else

367
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:21,723
Raju, why are sitting sad
-He exactly like his mother

368
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:25,486
Your partner only removed the slip,

369
00:38:25,627 --> 00:38:31,593
Will show you elephant, hourse, camal,

00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:39,562
So tomorrow at what time?-At 9:30
-Ok Raju tomorrow at 9:30 sharp

371
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:45,005
My big rose -Yes
-It smells good

372
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:48,365
Just open the lid, let me test it
-What are you doing?

373
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:49,912
You can not test it

374
00:38:50,272 --> 00:38:53,256
Rosy -Whenever I try to test it
someone comes in

375
00:38:55,485 --> 00:38:59,110
Is food ready, It ready from tomorrow,
-What? -I mean it's from long

376
00:39:00,391 --> 00:39:04,906
Good morning, Good morning everybody,
lovely weather no rain, everything ready

377
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:07,450
Where is Majer?
- Good morning

378
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,825
Good Morning -Army man never late
-Good Morning sir

379
00:39:13,903 --> 00:39:16,325
Where is Sister & Raju?
- There is small problem

380
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:21,506
Raju got wet in rain yesterday so he
is having fever, if goes out it may incrase

381
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:29,316
Let's go and see him -No no hold on
Somehave I manage to convence him

382
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,566
If you go, he will again start crying

383
00:39:31,863 --> 00:39:34,550
You both carry on,
What say Vinod?

384
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:39,134
I don't get into fight of sis and bro
in law, if you want we will put slips

385
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:43,535
There is no need of slips
-Correct, no need of slips

386
00:39:44,504 --> 00:39:46,848
Brother in law, picnic cancelled

387
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:50,607
That's right, picnic cancelled
-Why to cancelled picnic for this

388
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:52,272
This is also right,
why to cancell picnic?

389
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:55,180
It doesn't look nice, there is
more fun, if we go together

390
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:57,782
This is also right, we all shold
go together

391
00:39:58,108 --> 00:40:02,522
Aarti, you rearly come to this place,
we have gone there many times

392
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:05,090
This is also right, they
have gone there many times

393
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:09,059
Now I am not going to remove my
glasses any more, decide fast

394
00:40:09,213 --> 00:40:12,277
You both just go -let's go

395
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,059
Good -She is gone

396
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:18,837
Even after retirment, your habit
of giving orders not gone

397
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,462
You sent her alone -How alone?
Vinod is also with her

398
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:27,245
So what? Aarti is our responsibility

399
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:29,736
If Sunil comes to know about it,
what will he think?

400
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,864
But you were saying,
Both studied together

401
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:35,476
May be, but now Aarti is married

402
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:38,976
After marriage, women become more
intelligent, except you

403
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,413
What did you say?

404
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:44,570
Nothing, speak softly, Raju will get up
Don't talk

405
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:49,876
Don't know, Where both will be
roaming alone?

406
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,788
Listen one more, in winter a person
was giving bath to his cat

407
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,203
A passerby said, cat will die in this cold

408
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:02,363
He said go away and let
me do my job

409
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:07,613
second is person went away,
After some time

410
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:12,471
Same person saw, the first person
crying carrying cat on his lap

411
00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:15,459
I had told, she will die

412
00:41:15,786 --> 00:41:21,052
he said she died by not bathing
by squeezing

413
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:24,580
What's wrong, I keep on talking
and you are so quiet

414
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:27,040
If you wanted to be so silent,
why did you come for picnic?

415
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:28,095
Picnic was just a excuse

416
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:31,173
I had heard, Here a monk lives,
who is good at hand reading

417
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:33,939
Not met -How not met?

418
00:41:34,485 --> 00:41:40,696
That wise man is in front of you

419
00:41:41,108 --> 00:41:47,264
Anything -Show me your hand, till date,
whatever was told has come true

420
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:54,545
What a lines? You have age of 99

421
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:58,764
The line of fate is so strong,
Whoever comes near becomes lucky

422
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:03,857
But, But, Shadow of saturn on mars

423
00:42:04,303 --> 00:42:10,459
Got nothing even after having everything,
that's why mind is worried

424
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:13,600
But, thumb is straight

425
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:18,255
That means will power
-What? -self power

426
00:42:18,443 --> 00:42:21,911
whatever you think, you do it
-Yes -Yes

427
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:29,273
your hand shows, it's going to rain now
-You are lying -I am not lying, you saw

428
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:36,705
You will get wet -I don't need this
-Take it

429
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:41,909
You -Don't worry, I am waterproof,
you will get wet, wear it

430
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:50,128
The rain is increasing
-Yes, it is increasing

431
00:42:50,538 --> 00:42:52,584
Keep raining...

432
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:56,615
You are really crazy, rain is already
increasing and you are singing for rain

433
00:42:57,162 --> 00:43:00,818
OK than, I will sing to stop the rain
Do not rain...

434
00:43:01,194 --> 00:43:03,269
Ever in your life you were serious

435
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:10,166
Aarti, if person is always appears happy,
that does not mean he has no sadness

436
00:43:10,884 --> 00:43:14,556
What can make you sad, You are alone,
you don't have anybody

437
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:16,359
May be that is the reason

438
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:20,787
Sadness can be shared,
Someone has said it correct

439
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:26,755
You share your happiness, it gets double
and if you share your sorrows it gets half

440
00:43:27,177 --> 00:43:30,284
But, With whom to share
-Find someone

441
00:43:31,198 --> 00:43:35,630
Don't get so easily -If you try sincerely
you will definitely get

442
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,152
Rain Stopped, Let's go

443
00:43:56,256 --> 00:43:57,974
God bless you

444
00:43:58,284 --> 00:44:00,346
Appearing waterproof,
You realised now

445
00:44:01,129 --> 00:44:04,989
What is this -tea with ginger
Medicine for cold

446
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:09,161
Tell me one thing, When you got married

447
00:44:09,504 --> 00:44:13,099
Then your husband put the garland
or stethoscope

448
00:44:13,552 --> 00:44:15,115
You became doctor -quiet

449
00:44:15,678 --> 00:44:18,537
Is it must -Absolutely must

450
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:27,344
Wow, I enjoyed
-Than why you were acting

451
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:31,747
Mind was seeking happiness
-Yes I was, But..

452
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:34,078
But means, I mean

453
00:44:35,062 --> 00:44:39,015
Why you came yourself,
could have sent through someone

454
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,796
Why, you were not keeping well,
What is wrong If I get it

455
00:44:42,562 --> 00:44:43,624
Nothing happened

456
00:44:45,173 --> 00:44:46,485
Realized one thing

457
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,282
You must have someone

458
00:44:52,634 --> 00:44:56,352
That's why I am saying,
make someone yours quickly

459
00:45:01,196 --> 00:45:03,103
A wise companion should also be found

460
00:45:04,524 --> 00:45:05,603
You will get it

461
00:45:07,465 --> 00:45:08,902
it's not that easy

462
00:45:10,623 --> 00:45:12,326
Find the right partner at the right time

463
00:45:12,982 --> 00:45:14,326
It's a coincidence

464
00:45:16,543 --> 00:45:19,308
See, If you meet someone sometimes

465
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:22,763
Within two to four days it seems
like you know for years

466
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:27,331
And sometimes even after staying
together for years

467
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:35,566
Kept reading book of life and
never came to know the story

468
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:50,709
Listen, there is more tea in thermos,
If you want you can have it

469
00:45:56,398 --> 00:46:01,421
How is Raju? You know kids
get seek fast and get well soon

470
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:06,675
Hello, God morning everybody
-Good morning -Good morning Vinod

471
00:46:06,837 --> 00:46:09,852
How are you -Fine -How
was picnic? -first class

472
00:46:10,931 --> 00:46:13,571
still sneezing, Why didn't you
wear a sweater? -It's nothing

473
00:46:14,432 --> 00:46:18,275
the only medicine for cold is two
large whisky, What say major?

474
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,994
Correct, I too.. -Major, Hats off to Aarti

475
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:26,136
Yesterday we walk too far, but she did
not tired -Why? You forgot

476
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,652
Aarti never loses

477
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:35,224
After all, she is my sister in law
of army man

478
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:40,059
That means major, you are taking
credit of this -Why not?

479
00:46:40,584 --> 00:46:42,631
I chose Sunil for her

480
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:44,209
I got her bungalow

481
00:46:44,394 --> 00:46:49,441
I fixed it and it's decoration etc..
-That was by me

482
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:52,191
That's true, but hurry up, it
taking long time

483
00:46:52,707 --> 00:46:55,723
Major this is not like fighting,
to happen fast

484
00:46:56,055 --> 00:46:59,040
It's a matter of art, slowly...

485
00:46:59,722 --> 00:47:00,941
Even we are not in hurry

486
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:07,613
Saw, she understand it
-Listen

487
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:14,174
You are leaving? -No major it's not
like that -Why brother in law?

488
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:19,243
What is the matter -Aarti you won't
understand, this person sometime

489
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:24,233
has a habit of disappearing
-No major no slander

490
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:28,527
Very intresting person -Yes
-Laughing most of the time

491
00:47:31,884 --> 00:47:33,512
Aarti, just listen

492
00:47:34,038 --> 00:47:37,018
You shoul not mix up with unknown man
-What sister, you too...

493
00:47:37,141 --> 00:47:39,408
Speak softly -You started lecture

494
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:43,066
It's not lecture, I know you have
habit of talking friendly

495
00:47:43,182 --> 00:47:45,760
But, you don't know, what is in
his mind? -Sister I am not a kid

496
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,241
Speak softly -Mummy my bat
broke down

497
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:50,058
Ok, we will get new one
-When will you get?

498
00:47:50,213 --> 00:47:52,581
You told me to give Camera on Birthday
that is also not given -Go and paly

499
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:54,647
Raju dear, how are you?
- Fine

500
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:57,603
I am going to give you, your
mom will not give you anything

501
00:47:57,854 --> 00:47:59,370
No need to give me...
- Shooo...

502
00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:02,388
You will spoil his habits -Yes
-let's go aunty

503
00:48:06,098 --> 00:48:08,754
It's nice, isn't it, take this money

504
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:13,159
You, What are doing here?

505
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:17,919
In photo studio, certainly not to

506
00:48:18,918 --> 00:48:22,371
Oho Partner, You are here

Let's go -Are you happy?

00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:50,419
This is how you change it, buddy

513
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:52,404
Friend, Corn

514
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:55,875
Corn

515
00:48:56,108 --> 00:48:59,561
Let's have it -Withdraw money

516
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,525
I am the master, give me my fees,
you feed me corn

517
00:49:03,389 --> 00:49:06,779
Have you run out of money?

518
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:11,148
Will play eye fight -let's play
-Whoever lose will feed corn

519
00:49:11,304 --> 00:49:14,148
Agree. -Agree, Ok

520
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:38,737
Oh.. you lost -No friend
You made me laugh, it's cheating

521
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:43,380
No No.. I have not done any cheating,
-Look aunty friend is cheating me

522
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:47,179
What cheating -you cheated him
I saw it -What I did?

523
00:49:47,461 --> 00:49:49,461
You were not making strange
faces to make him laugh

524
00:49:51,062 --> 00:49:54,623
First of all you are playing with kids,
on top of that doing cheating with them

525
00:49:55,436 --> 00:49:59,014
You are not a kid, let's play
-Yes aunty let's play

526
00:50:02,143 --> 00:50:03,987
Let's play -Ok start

527
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:08,330
One Two Three start

528
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,284
Do you remember,
Aarti never looses

529
00:50:13,963 --> 00:50:17,400
Let us see, who wins and
who looses

530
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:33,130
What happened? Show me,
let me see

531
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:46,280
Come on, feed us corn
- Why should I?

532
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:49,267
What do you mean by Why?
You lost the game

533
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:51,907
You are forcing me,
-Yes forcing you

534
00:50:52,173 --> 00:50:54,783
Come on, give is corns,
Give us three forcefully corn

Put some lime on it, give lime to me

536
00:51:13,852 --> 00:51:17,929
What are looking at?-
You looks like a kid

537
00:51:20,274 --> 00:51:22,602
Childhood is so good

538
00:51:23,698 --> 00:51:31,667
Really, childhood days are the best,
not aware of troubles of life

539
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:40,901
Sometimes I feel like going back
into my old days and restart as new

540
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:54,576
What? Miscarriage

541
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:56,772
I am sorry, I could not
save the baby

542
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,525
How is Aarti? -She is fine

543
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:06,322
Sunil, it would be
better if you plan

544
00:52:06,535 --> 00:52:09,088
Your next child after some years

545
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:50,066
It’s not your fault at all..

546
00:52:51,863 --> 00:52:55,500
Maybe it’s not in our destiny so soon..

547
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:06,172
You can atleast cry, You don’t know
what I am going Through

548
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:09,376
I can’t even cry

549
00:53:18,392 --> 00:53:26,507
To forget this trauma, we will
Have to support each other

550
00:53:39,644 --> 00:53:42,910
Hello -Hello It’s me

551
00:53:44,147 --> 00:53:49,410
Why did you hang up?
Are you angry?

552
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:54,464
I wanted to get there and
give you a surprise

553
00:53:57,939 --> 00:54:03,255
Are you coming? -and listen

554
00:54:03,693 --> 00:54:05,956
the food ought to be just great

555
00:54:07,003 --> 00:54:08,378
Shall I invite my sister
And brother-in-law?

556
00:54:08,432 --> 00:54:17,049
No, only me and you tonight
I will be there by eight

557
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:23,171
Are you sure? -what?
Be here by eight -okay

558
00:54:24,703 --> 00:54:30,126
Thank god, you checked my diary
and told me, What’s my schedule today?

559
00:54:30,264 --> 00:54:33,020
You got an appointment with
Doctor Prakash at 7.30 pm

560
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:37,851
Let me pour you another drink
-No Prakash, it’s already late

561
00:55:38,382 --> 00:55:40,742
Why is Sinha talking so long?

562
00:55:41,265 --> 00:55:43,605
Did you tell him, I have to go
to Khandala after the meeting?

563
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:47,236
Yes sir, he had told me that,
he will come by 7.30pm

564
00:55:48,705 --> 00:55:51,615
It’s already 8.30pm -you may
go if you are getting late..

565
00:55:51,687 --> 00:55:54,076
When sinha comes, he will
Explain to me the plan

566
00:55:55,506 --> 00:55:58,320
Go and find out why
He’s getting late

567
00:55:59,362 --> 00:56:03,372
Prakash I don’t trust this man
He is already messed up earlier

568
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:07,539
What? He has not come yet?
If he comes tell him

569
00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:10,002
We are waiting for him and he should
reach here immediately

570
00:56:14,493 --> 00:56:15,893
Let me fill your glass atleast now

571
00:57:43,771 --> 00:57:45,740
Good Evening Sir, Good Evening?

572
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:51,412
It’s 10.30pm in the night. I
forgot to carry plan with me

573
00:57:51,561 --> 00:57:54,206
When I went home and so… It’s okay
Don’t waste time

574
00:57:54,417 --> 00:57:56,675
Let’s get stared

575
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,145
Stop

576
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,773
Aarti, where are you going
so late in the night

577
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:43,929
Going to Hell, Move on please
-What Happan Aarti?

578
00:58:51,801 --> 00:58:53,050
What are you doing Aarti?

579
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:57,567
Drive Slowly

581
00:59:05,573 --> 00:59:06,838
Aarti!

582
00:59:12,492 --> 00:59:13,773
Have you gone mad?

583
00:59:36,543 --> 00:59:37,543
Aarti

584
00:59:41,606 --> 00:59:42,629
Aarti

585
00:59:44,174 --> 00:59:45,174
stop aarti

586
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,249
For God sake, Stop Aarti

587
00:59:54,349 --> 00:59:56,480

590
01:00:33,384 --> 01:00:35,368
Aarti, Sorry

591
01:00:35,587 --> 01:00:38,352
What did I dream and What I Got

592
01:00:38,585 --> 01:00:41,296
I did not ask lot from life

593
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:45,277
Just sought company and love

594
01:00:46,115 --> 01:00:47,865
Did not get even that

595
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,193
That doesn's mean,
you hate your life

596
01:00:51,137 --> 01:00:54,059
Is life called breathing

597
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,594
My life is such a dark night

598
01:00:58,766 --> 01:01:01,522
No matter how long and ldark the night is

599
01:01:02,124 --> 01:01:03,353
The morning definitely comes

600
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:06,396
And than you used to always says

601
01:01:07,078 --> 01:01:08,349
Aarti never loses

602
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,439
Lost so soon?

603
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:17,678
You are right, I can live
I will live

604
01:01:18,722 --> 01:01:20,213
Will fight alone with the world

605
01:01:20,997 --> 01:01:23,276
Alone -No Aarti

606
01:01:24,635 --> 01:01:27,980
You are not alone, Aarti

607
01:01:30,405 --> 01:01:31,755
let us go back

608
01:02:14,636 --> 01:02:15,636
Good morning

609
01:02:32,044 --> 01:02:34,892
Will you have tea?
- Off course

610
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:37,711
Rosy

611
01:02:40,232 --> 01:02:41,979
I will get the tea

612
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:03,465
Aarti, I could not sleep all night

613
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:05,912
Kept thinking about you

614
01:03:10,088 --> 01:03:11,721
was thinking

615
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:16,813
Work is over and I have to go

616
01:03:18,637 --> 01:03:20,164
I was thinking

617
01:03:22,036 --> 01:03:23,036
You also

618
01:03:24,942 --> 01:03:27,711
I want to... -Madam

619
01:03:28,176 --> 01:03:31,315
Bus goes in the evening from here
I told you I have to go

620
01:03:32,534 --> 01:03:33,052
You can go

621
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,421
If I can get some money

622
01:03:35,627 --> 01:03:37,310
You need money? -Yes
-Come with me

623
01:03:54,494 --> 01:03:56,494
Sir, the telephone line to
Khandala is out of order

624
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,934
Okey! Evening I am going there only

625
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,016
Ok Madam, I am leaving

626
01:04:01,222 --> 01:04:02,834
In such heavy rain
-I have umbrella

627
01:04:03,058 --> 01:04:04,058
OK, take care

628
01:04:04,848 --> 01:04:07,143
Madam, Vinod sir has given letter
for you

629
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:08,538
Letter? -Yes

630
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,050
OK, Madam

631
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:19,932
You will surprised to have this letter

632
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:21,573
Matter is like that

633
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,738
Even after staying nearby and
meeting daily, why I wrote letter

634
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:29,658
The thing which I could not tell in
the college, which remains in my heart

635
01:04:29,925 --> 01:04:33,816
Could not express so far, at last
I had to take help of pen

636
01:04:34,656 --> 01:04:37,695
Aarti, we have met once again,
in our second phase of life

637
01:04:38,538 --> 01:04:41,803
We stayed together for few days,
got chance to understand each other

638
01:04:42,622 --> 01:04:45,060
Came to know, how lonely you
are in your life

639
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,500
You are still alone,
even after getting married

640
01:04:49,874 --> 01:04:51,772
Something missing,
even after having everything

641
01:04:52,234 --> 01:04:52,952
Why is it so?

642
01:04:53,201 --> 01:04:55,240
I understand your helplessness

643
01:04:55,645 --> 01:04:59,243
And as much as I understand,
I feel so close to you

644
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,148
If you wish, I can get new
life for you

645
01:05:08,707 --> 01:05:10,605
Just need your signal

646
01:05:10,974 --> 01:05:14,669
If you are afraid of making a decision,
Than I can support you

647
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,371
I can face every trouble for your happiness

648
01:05:18,193 --> 01:05:19,365
Your Vinod

649
01:05:46,813 --> 01:05:50,570
Yes this is Arti here,
Wher are you?

650
01:05:55,082 --> 01:05:56,410
From Where?

651
01:05:58,973 --> 01:06:00,848
I can't hear you,
please speak loudly

652
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:11,332
I understand your helplessness, Aarti

653
01:06:14,642 --> 01:06:17,962
If you wish, I can get new
life for you

654
01:06:20,082 --> 01:06:24,254
If you are afraid of making a decision,
Than I can support you

655
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:35,081
Bahadur, Rosy

656
01:06:36,165 --> 01:06:37,703
Bahadur -Dr. Sunil

657
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:39,855
Who are you? -Vinod

658
01:06:40,385 --> 01:06:42,860
I see, the interior decorator

659
01:06:43,425 --> 01:06:46,985
I will meet Aarti and come
-Do you care about Aarti?

660
01:06:48,415 --> 01:06:51,869
Why? What happened to her? -how
can you care mental illness?

661
01:06:52,678 --> 01:06:54,838
But then, you don’t have a
mental Relationship with her

662
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,897
What do you want to say? -that
which aarti couldn’t tell you

663
01:06:59,606 --> 01:07:03,473
How could she tell you something
That she couldn’t tell me?

664
01:07:03,845 --> 01:07:08,345
You have been called here to
Decorate the house, not to break it

665
01:07:08,511 --> 01:07:10,491
A house isn’t a house just
Because it has been decorated

666
01:07:11,053 --> 01:07:14,231
I see? -A house is
made of love..

667
01:07:14,312 --> 01:07:15,827
Sharing happiness and sadness,
Supporting each other in hardships

668
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:17,632
And those are the things that
were never given to her by you

669
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,544
Shut up.. -It’s true

670
01:07:19,611 --> 01:07:21,809
It’s a fact, If you don’t
Believe me, ask her.

671
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:35,959
Its true, Aarti? Don’t
be scared Aarti

672
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:38,749
Tell him everything today

673
01:07:39,045 --> 01:07:41,813
Tell him how happy And
peacefull you are

674
01:07:42,367 --> 01:07:45,858
Tell him you were so happy that
You tried to commit suicide

675
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:47,180
Tell him

676
01:07:55,300 --> 01:08:00,743
Is it true?
Answer me? Is it true?

677
01:08:32,785 --> 01:08:34,527
Sister -tell me

678
01:08:35,058 --> 01:08:36,058

679
01:08:37,136 --> 01:08:39,816
For tonight come and slip with me

680
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:44,634
Rosy is also not there,
Alone I'm scared, stormy night

681
01:08:44,836 --> 01:08:46,470
You come here

682
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:50,182
No, Sunil had called, He is on his
way, any moment he can come

683
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,972
OK than I will come after Raju
sleeps -OK, come soon

684
01:09:37,038 --> 01:09:38,537
I knew, You will come

685
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:46,081
Got the letter? -Yes, I am
here answer that letter

686
01:09:51,831 --> 01:09:56,502
You decorated house, it's your fees,
-Fees?

687
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:03,969
But the love it is decorated with,
Can't be settle with the money

688
01:10:05,355 --> 01:10:09,842
Yes, You have got money in
return of Love

689
01:10:10,533 --> 01:10:11,611
May be because of that

690
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,369
I thought -I understand everything

691
01:10:14,947 --> 01:10:18,126
Aarti, I want to share your sorrows
By supporting you

692
01:10:18,377 --> 01:10:20,947
I have already given this rights
-But it can be taken back

693
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:25,335
Such rights can't be taken back,
Whom I have made my principles

694
01:10:26,668 --> 01:10:29,239
Principles, which doesn't have feelings
for your pain

695
01:10:29,575 --> 01:10:32,231
Whose negligence forced you to make suicide

696
01:10:32,535 --> 01:10:35,049
In whose eyes the value of your love,
Nothing except money

697
01:10:35,237 --> 01:10:37,487
This money has made you blind
-You are blind

698
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:41,595
You need the light, you will get
only darkness in this house

699
01:10:41,898 --> 01:10:44,025
Go away from here
-Aarti

700
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:48,996
Aarti

701
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:54,627
Aarti, Listen to me -I don't want
to listen anything from you

702
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:56,252
Didn't you say,

703
01:10:56,674 --> 01:11:00,158
In few days we will start understanding
each other very well

704
01:11:00,431 --> 01:11:02,909
We can start a new life,
Didn't you say that

705
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,483
No partner, no love

706
01:11:07,807 --> 01:11:10,386
If you try sincerely you will
definitely get your partner

707
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:13,799
Aarti, didn't you say that?
- Yes I said that

708
01:11:14,852 --> 01:11:19,351
Unknowingly to lighten my mind
I said that, but you misunderstood

709
01:11:21,062 --> 01:11:23,870
Lie has many faces,
Just one of the truth

710
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,870
I never told you a lie

711
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,762
But, What you wanted to understand,
that you understood in your own way

712
01:11:29,974 --> 01:11:32,546
No, I understood it correctly Aarti

713
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:36,796
You are running from truth, You are
scared

714
01:11:37,676 --> 01:11:41,036
you want to Suicide due to
pressure from society

715
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:43,004
I will never live like that

716
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:45,465
I will now never allow you to
do that

717
01:11:46,121 --> 01:11:47,199
You have to decide it now

718
01:11:47,633 --> 01:11:48,938
Today just now

719
01:11:50,156 --> 01:11:51,156

723
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:19,311
You can't kill me

01:12:19,775 --> 01:12:23,900
No Aarti -Don't get ahead
-You can't kill me

725
01:12:24,658 --> 01:12:26,041
I can kill myself

726
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:28,586
What are you doing

727
01:12:29,477 --> 01:12:32,945
No -Leave me

728
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:36,361
Let me die

729
01:13:11,316 --> 01:13:18,833
Frightened?
You! -Who else can touch you?

730
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:24,797
What are you looking at?

731
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:30,173
I was stuck in the storm
Look at my condition

732
01:13:30,735 --> 01:13:34,018
I look like a ghost
I will freshen up

733
01:13:46,111 --> 01:13:47,822
No Aarti, you can't kill me

734
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:49,880

01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:40,664
Police, If the police come

739
01:14:41,695 --> 01:14:43,491
No, No, No...

740
01:14:49,677 --> 01:14:52,310
Aarti, Nothing will happen to you

741
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:58,042
Nothing can happen to you,

Aarti come fast

743
01:15:27,555 --> 01:15:28,743

01:16:17,847 --> 01:16:22,626
Let me take a look at you, Wow!

745
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:31,123
You took a long time to come
-Be thankful I came

746
01:16:37,895 --> 01:16:41,842
Can I ask you something?
I am famished

747
01:16:42,448 --> 01:16:44,332
I am starving since last night..

748
01:17:33,258 --> 01:17:35,258
Has Sunil arrived?

749
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:40,094
Don't cry, Aarti

750
01:17:40,998 --> 01:17:44,451
Don't cry, Aarti

751
01:17:47,438 --> 01:17:50,594
Sister, what has happened

752
01:17:50,922 --> 01:17:55,285
Looks like... Whenever
Happiness comes near me

753
01:17:57,677 --> 01:18:01,406
Why does this happen to me

754
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:05,038
Be brave

755
01:18:05,483 --> 01:18:09,561
The more you think about it,
the more upset you will be

756
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:16,304
I also tremble when I think about it

757
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,125
The brain doesn't work

758
01:18:20,384 --> 01:18:22,368
This we can not even tell anyone

759
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:24,556
If anyone comes to know

760
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:27,812
Then your life will be ruined

761
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:32,762
Respect of our house,
Sunil's big name...

762
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:39,199
But Sister, How can I hide it from him

763
01:18:41,644 --> 01:18:46,269
Tell me -No No.. Don't
tell anything to Sunil

764
01:18:47,313 --> 01:18:50,767
Even if he gets suspicious
But then, he was

765
01:18:51,486 --> 01:18:55,892
Your college mate..
What will sunil think?

766
01:18:57,173 --> 01:19:01,130
He will lose his trust in you

767
01:19:02,732 --> 01:19:06,944
I don’t know what to do -Make it fast!
I am starved

768
01:19:07,147 --> 01:19:08,772

The weather here is peculiar
Last night there was a storm and

773
01:19:37,253 --> 01:19:39,053
Today there’s bright
sunshine Its normal here

774
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:41,426
Yes, Here it is like that only

775
01:19:41,972 --> 01:19:46,015
You have made such a beautiful
house, But you never come down

776
01:19:46,473 --> 01:19:50,786
What can I do? My work requires
My attention 24 hours a day

777
01:19:52,237 --> 01:19:58,974
Good, The house is beautiful, But
were is the interior decorator?

778
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:02,538
He must be around be somewhere
Give it to me

01:20:03,204 --> 01:20:05,148

01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:12,877

Yes, I have planned to
stay For 3-4 days

784
01:20:21,728 --> 01:20:24,650
You are a doctor, You should
take Care of your health, …

785
01:20:24,807 --> 01:20:26,313
Or else how will you take
Care of you patients?

786
01:20:26,337 --> 01:20:28,457
And then your reputation is
such thatonce a patient…

787
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:33,139
visits you, he never again
goes to any other doctor

788
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,015
What do you mean? You mean to
Say, the patient who visits me…

789
01:20:37,305 --> 01:20:42,181
No, no..what I meant was he will
Not visit any other doctor

01:20:43,494 --> 01:20:47,659

We have met in a long time.

01:20:56,848 --> 01:21:00,583
Shall I spread it? -To Whom?
On the toast. -sure

796
01:21:02,554 --> 01:21:04,589
The house has been
Beautifully decorated

797
01:21:04,695 --> 01:21:08,567
I selected the interior decorator
-Brother-in-law, how about sugar?

798
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,630
Three spoons? -no, only one

799
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:13,831
After forty, your sugar
intake Should be reduced

800
01:21:14,012 --> 01:21:18,576
How many times I have told you not
To mention my age in front of women

801
01:21:18,758 --> 01:21:21,694
What’s your programme today?
Going out or sitting at home?

802
01:21:21,814 --> 01:21:23,830
We will go out. I have not
came Here to sit at home

803
01:21:23,948 --> 01:21:26,323
Okay. we will come
in the evening -okay

804
01:21:55,753 --> 01:21:59,632
What are you looking at?
- Nothing

805
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:09,464
You appear as if you
have seen a ghost

806
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:11,854
No -yes

807
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:19,244
No. -What happened to you?
I was just a bit dizzy

808
01:22:19,495 --> 01:22:21,405
Let me take a look.

809
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:25,532
They’re here. Should we
Call off the programme?

810
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:30,660
I am okay. Lets go.
We are leaving

811
01:22:31,979 --> 01:22:37,188
You are going out? -Yes,
We are going out

812
01:22:37,431 --> 01:22:38,962
Good

813
01:22:39,628 --> 01:22:43,244
What are you saying? -Yes,
I have seen his ghost

814
01:22:44,245 --> 01:22:45,637
You saw him again? -Yes

815
01:22:45,808 --> 01:22:47,496
I saw him from the top floor

816
01:22:48,043 --> 01:22:50,566
When I came down,
He had disappeared

817
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:53,879
It must be your imagination.
There are no ghosts

818
01:22:57,332 --> 01:22:59,160
What are you talking about?

819
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:03,571
Nothing at all. -Uncle, she
is talking about ghosts

820
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:09,117
Again? You have seen
a ghost here also?

821
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:13,249
Tell me something, was the
ghost A male or female?

822
01:23:13,495 --> 01:23:19,296
Sunil, if the woman must be
beautiful, The ghost must be a man

823
01:23:19,848 --> 01:23:24,666
I see. Then the ghost doesn’t know
That she is a doctor Sunil’s wife

824
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:29,869
If I see him, I will shoot him
With your third rate life

825
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,672
Sunil you have scared me

826
01:23:36,268 --> 01:23:39,516
From now on I won’t be able
to joke with her

827
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:42,786
You are a big boss. -Yes, I am

828
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:47,210
Because the more jealous a man
Becomes, the more he loves his wife

829
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:54,471
Now see, you are not jealous.
- I have other options

830
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:18,671
What happened? Too much sugar? -you
haven’t added any sugar to it

831
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:33,213
Is doctor sunil at home?
Yes. -Who is it?

832
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:11,555
Let's go driver

833
01:25:22,101 --> 01:25:27,227
Aarti, Why did the police come?
Did he ask you anything? -No

834
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:28,744
Why did he take sunil along?

835
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,496
May be... -Where is that tourch

836
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:36,196
Which tourch? -Same I had that day
Where is it? -With me

837
01:25:36,606 --> 01:25:39,058
What you doing here,

838
01:25:55,201 --> 01:25:58,561
Sister, it's not here -It's not there also,
let's see on 1st floor

839
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:24,370
Sister can't find it, even I can't find it,
Where it could be?

840
01:26:25,402 --> 01:26:26,590
In the car?

841
01:26:39,578 --> 01:26:44,312
No sister -It's not here also,
Where it could be? may be there

842
01:26:46,783 --> 01:26:49,813
It's here, Must have fallan from
your hand -Sister

843
01:26:51,903 --> 01:26:54,028
How it can go down?

844
01:26:57,495 --> 01:27:01,902
If the corpse fell down from here,
it should be here -Than where is it?

845
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:04,527
Than.. We shouldn't have come here

846
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:06,493
Let’s go

847
01:27:24,378 --> 01:27:32,378
What will happen now?
What are you doing here?

848
01:27:33,397 --> 01:27:43,397
We came to see the Mahakali Temple.
Have you came here with a wish?

849
01:27:44,954 --> 01:27:47,580
Inspector, I will go with them.

850
01:27:54,341 --> 01:27:56,254
Why did you go tot the police station?

851
01:27:57,074 --> 01:27:59,465
To enquiry about a dead body
-Dead Body?

852
01:27:59,949 --> 01:28:03,729
Yes, yesterday when I was coming, I
came across a womens dead body

853
01:28:04,443 --> 01:28:09,639
I intimated the police. At first
I thought it was a accident,

854
01:28:10,241 --> 01:28:13,570
On investigation it was found out
That her husband was suspicious…

855
01:28:14,078 --> 01:28:17,860
About her, and so he killed her.
Since I intimated the police,

856
01:28:18,213 --> 01:28:21,355
They wanted my statement.
Lets go.

857
01:28:39,347 --> 01:28:42,940
Go on, Chaturvedi. Who, me?
No, I will be

858
01:28:43,714 --> 01:28:49,230
Staying here for 3-4 days.
Who? Mr.Biharilal?

859
01:28:50,573 --> 01:28:53,668
If he has problem with his sleep,
Give him some tranquilizer

860
01:28:54,145 --> 01:28:55,739
Yes, its okay. It’s
not a big problem,

861
01:28:56,814 --> 01:28:59,114
You take care of it.
It's not big problem

862
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:06,218
No, I will be here for another
3-4 days. Anything else?

863
01:29:06,982 --> 01:29:08,685
No Problems, OK.

864
01:29:09,347 --> 01:29:11,497
If there is any urgency,
We will go back.

865
01:29:16,772 --> 01:29:19,222
What happened? -Why?

866
01:29:19,690 --> 01:29:25,852
Why? When I am there you always
Complain that I don’t give the company

867
01:29:26,133 --> 01:29:29,227
When I give the company,
You want me to go back

868
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:33,907
I thought it was something very urgent.
- Its not urgent there, but here

869
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:37,266
What’s so urgent here?

870
01:29:43,205 --> 01:29:45,447
It is urgent, isn’t it?

871
01:29:58,918 --> 01:30:00,200
Get in

872
01:30:05,816 --> 01:30:07,598
Sunil, please come soon

873
01:30:10,241 --> 01:30:12,812
What happened? -Look,
He is wounded.

874
01:30:13,191 --> 01:30:15,569
Sit down here. Rosy,
fetch some warm water

875
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:17,240
Bring my bag. -OK sir

876
01:30:18,631 --> 01:30:23,056
Who is he? -Vinod, your
interior decorator.

877
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:24,181
Yes, He is the man

878
01:30:24,813 --> 01:30:27,923
What happened to him? He’s
is the habit of drinking

879
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:31,217
He might have been hit by some truck

880
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:45,489
Doesn’t look like
An accident injury

881
01:30:45,767 --> 01:30:48,906
Didn’t you ask him?
- He wont say a word

882
01:30:52,563 --> 01:30:56,345
What? What are they saying?
How can it happen?

883
01:30:56,579 --> 01:30:59,251
I am speaking the truth.
He is sitting right there

884
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:00,305
Inside? -Yes

885
01:31:00,499 --> 01:31:05,935
Let’s go and see. Doesn’t
-he have any relatives here?

886
01:31:06,862 --> 01:31:10,621
I don’t think so. He
never mentioned any

887
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:16,722
Good Morning, What happened to him?
- Exactly what I suspected.

888
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,673
What suspicion? -An
injury to the brain

889
01:31:22,204 --> 01:31:23,688
He has lost his memory

890
01:31:25,009 --> 01:31:29,184
Will he always be like this?
- It will take some time.

891
01:31:29,581 --> 01:31:31,926
Will he stay here until then?

892
01:31:32,265 --> 01:31:35,328
Where he will get the
Better doctor than Sunil?

893
01:31:35,612 --> 01:31:40,021
Bahadur… -Coming, Sir
Have you made the bed? -Yes Sir

894
01:31:40,438 --> 01:31:43,530
Take him inside.

895
01:31:46,758 --> 01:31:50,961
Aarti, that means,
We.. to live man

896
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:56,375
It's good, at least
We are saved from sin

897
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:00,086
Now it's better we forget
this incident

898
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:06,071
Sister, I will tell everything to Sunil
-No No, Are you gone mad

899
01:32:06,455 --> 01:32:09,737
Don't you know Sunil?
If Sunil comes to know

900
01:32:09,925 --> 01:32:13,315
Vinod used to study with you and
used to love him

901
01:32:13,744 --> 01:32:17,275
But I did not like him -But how will
you make Sunil understand this

902
01:32:17,563 --> 01:32:20,380
He will misunderstand you
-But you know everything, Sister

903
01:32:20,656 --> 01:32:25,124
I know, God knows, But Sunil
doesn't know

904
01:32:26,461 --> 01:32:30,695
Blood stains may disappear, but
Doubt never fades

905
01:32:32,051 --> 01:32:36,426
If Sunil misunderstood you,
nobody will trust you

906
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:41,958
And than, You will never be able to
proove yourself innocent

907
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:49,786
Lest it happen, that your little mistake,
may ruin your family life

908
01:32:51,745 --> 01:32:55,652
Aarti, These secrets will remain
with us

909
01:32:55,944 --> 01:32:58,741
If Vinod said anything to Sunil?

910
01:32:59,226 --> 01:33:01,866
He has lots of misunderstaning
regarding me

911
01:33:03,295 --> 01:33:07,373
There is only one way, before he regain
his memory

912
01:33:07,944 --> 01:33:10,116
somehow he shuold be removed
from this house

913
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:17,136
You are throwing your the best cards.
- I don’t need your help

914
01:33:18,472 --> 01:33:21,738
Okay, try this

915
01:33:22,206 --> 01:33:24,971
Doctor, I didn’t get a
single card till now

916
01:33:25,191 --> 01:33:28,292
I’ve got a full hand!

917
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:31,292
Your turn, madam

918
01:33:32,202 --> 01:33:37,941
Come in -Me pack -Vinod come sit down
-You packed?

919
01:33:40,309 --> 01:33:43,021
You want to play? -you are
a strange man, major

920
01:33:43,381 --> 01:33:46,943
He has lost his memory,
-oh, I forgot

921
01:33:47,239 --> 01:33:52,005
But you had told me that he will
Regain his memory gradually

922
01:33:52,702 --> 01:33:56,984
In such cases patient tries
to Remember old memories

923
01:33:57,781 --> 01:34:02,110
Like school or college days
And then slowly he tries to

924
01:34:02,451 --> 01:34:04,140
Remember his recent past

925
01:34:04,444 --> 01:34:07,008
I think we should try to make
Him remember his old days

926
01:34:07,257 --> 01:34:09,710
Aarti can solve this problem
-How?

927
01:34:10,139 --> 01:34:14,043
They were college
mates, -Right, vidya?

928
01:34:15,146 --> 01:34:18,400
Yes. -Really? You never
told me about it

929
01:34:19,793 --> 01:34:22,264
I thought I told you

930
01:34:22,379 --> 01:34:25,234
Madam, the food is ready.
- Let me see

931
01:34:29,523 --> 01:34:32,586
Then I think it will
be easy for me.

932
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:58,313
Aarti, Do you have another pen? The
refill In this pen has exhausted

933
01:35:12,825 --> 01:35:14,386
Put a refill in this

934
01:35:16,903 --> 01:35:20,441
What’s the matter?
- Will he stay here

935
01:35:21,173 --> 01:35:23,027
Who? -He

936
01:35:23,799 --> 01:35:25,426
Vinod? -Yes

937
01:35:27,122 --> 01:35:29,036
Yes. -Is it necessary?

938
01:35:29,595 --> 01:35:31,984
Why? He use to stay
Here even earlier

939
01:35:32,094 --> 01:35:33,134
But not in this condition

940
01:35:33,765 --> 01:35:36,233
Why don’t you admit him
to A government hospital?

941
01:35:37,282 --> 01:35:40,844
I see. So you know his
Condition better than me?

942
01:35:42,923 --> 01:35:46,600
He is not that serious to Be
admitted in the hospital

943
01:35:46,954 --> 01:35:50,985
Besides, I’m here too. Why…?
You have a problem with him?

944
01:35:51,864 --> 01:35:54,234
Why should I be worried?

945
01:35:59,778 --> 01:36:02,106
Mr. Sharma
-Don’t talk to me

946
01:36:02,309 --> 01:36:04,825
I am angry with you -Why?
What happened?

947
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:07,567
You never met me
after coming here

948
01:36:08,301 --> 01:36:13,959
I came two days back. -Two days? I
met your wife here last Sunday

949
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:17,278
She has been here for some time
-Has she come all alone?

950
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:18,611

Man with her..forget it

“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1017
01:44:20,936 --> 01:44:26,832
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1018
01:44:27,529 --> 01:44:35,436
“Even if they are friends,
They can never be loyal”

1019
01:44:36,072 --> 01:44:42,808
“These pretty women Are
true friends to no one”

1020
01:44:43,214 --> 01:44:48,898
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1021
01:45:15,442 --> 01:45:18,660
“They are not to
blame, however..”

1022
01:45:18,865 --> 01:45:24,886
“what they do is so little”

1023
01:45:25,557 --> 01:45:35,039
“There’s someone they think about,
But get linked with someone else”

1024
01:45:35,601 --> 01:45:42,023
“Even when you think they’re
yours, They’re complete strangers”

1025
01:45:42,303 --> 01:45:48,360
“Even God couldn’t figure them
out, What is a mortal capable of?"

1026
01:45:48,743 --> 01:45:55,672
"What is a mortal capable of?"

1027
01:46:00,936 --> 01:46:07,500
“They’ll sway in stranger arms,
They will forget ties ages old”

1028
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,625
"They will forget ties ages old”

1029
01:46:10,855 --> 01:46:17,208
“They keep changing their
minds Like the season change”

1030
01:46:17,623 --> 01:46:20,709
"Minds Like the season change”

1031
01:46:20,954 --> 01:46:24,078
“Their love is
always suspect…”

1032
01:46:24,343 --> 01:46:27,514
“they belong not
to anyone Forever”

1033
01:46:27,608 --> 01:46:34,085
“they belong not
to anyone Forever”

1034
01:46:34,345 --> 01:46:37,583
“They are as deceitful
As they are beautiful”

1035
01:46:37,743 --> 01:46:40,982
“to deceive is the profession
Of beautiful women”

1036
01:46:41,085 --> 01:46:47,470
“to deceive is the profession
Of beautiful women”

1037
01:46:56,149 --> 01:47:03,026
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1038
01:47:03,323 --> 01:47:09,320
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1039
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:17,800
“Even if they are friends,
They can never be loyal”

1040
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:24,795
“These pretty women Are
true friends to no one”

1041
01:47:24,935 --> 01:47:30,796
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1042
01:47:56,675 --> 01:48:05,727
Which flowers are that? What are
you looking at? -Your eyes

1043
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:11,711
What do you see in them?
- What not?

1044
01:48:12,337 --> 01:48:13,684
Can I say something? -Go ahead

1045
01:48:14,424 --> 01:48:17,616
Will you keep it a secret? -Yes

1046
01:48:18,894 --> 01:48:24,086
Close your eyes when somebody
Comes in front of you. Why?

1047
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:27,427
Seeing those eyes any one…
Will fall in love with you. Just

1048
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:29,330
like I fell in love with you

1049
01:48:31,774 --> 01:48:37,424
My eyes have only your image

1050
01:49:06,633 --> 01:49:11,287
Try again -no..

1051
01:49:14,102 --> 01:49:20,977
Sir…
Sir.. -Buddy, you have won!

1052
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:23,947
Good Morning
-God Morning

1053
01:49:24,999 --> 01:49:28,735
Dear, go have your breakfast
-Buddy, I will have my breakfast

1054
01:49:55,069 --> 01:49:59,088
Tell me something. Have
you ever been in love?

1055
01:50:01,049 --> 01:50:04,315
Love? -Yes, Love

1056
01:50:05,541 --> 01:50:09,697
No. -Try to recall
When you were kid?

1057
01:50:10,601 --> 01:50:13,690
No. -In school

1058
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:17,377
No. -In college

1059
01:50:19,906 --> 01:50:21,266
Yes

1060
01:50:23,489 --> 01:50:28,052
What kind of girl was she? I mean
Was she fair or dark of skin?

1061
01:50:31,402 --> 01:50:33,162
Fair

1062
01:50:34,314 --> 01:50:37,268
Her hair? -was long

1063
01:50:39,558 --> 01:50:42,410
What was the thing in her
That had you captivated?

1064
01:50:44,299 --> 01:50:45,299
Her eyes

1065
01:51:24,251 --> 01:51:27,048
Shall I switch off the light?
- No..

1066
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:33,726
Coming to bed? -You
sleep, I am sitting here

1067
01:51:48,138 --> 01:51:50,763
I told you, I wont be coming now

1068
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:39,618
It’s dawn already?

1069
01:53:41,577 --> 01:53:43,950
You slept here?

1070
01:53:45,068 --> 01:53:46,633
Tell rosy to fetch some tea

1071
01:53:54,384 --> 01:53:56,752
Rosy, bring my lighter

1072
01:54:14,029 --> 01:54:15,123
Here you are

1073
01:54:18,811 --> 01:54:22,321
Listen, I have
something to tell you

1074
01:54:33,638 --> 01:54:39,027
Are you angry with me?
What’s the matter?

1075
01:54:41,070 --> 01:54:42,007
Don’t you know?

1076
01:54:45,474 --> 01:54:47,048
You are misunderstanding me

1077
01:54:50,572 --> 01:54:52,926
I used to misunderstand you

1078
01:54:59,151 --> 01:55:02,244
It’s not as you are thinking it is

1079
01:55:04,712 --> 01:55:09,256
What? What did you say?
It’s not as you are thinking it is

1080
01:55:10,871 --> 01:55:12,972
If you can’t diagnose the disease
by looking at the patient face…

1081
01:55:13,188 --> 01:55:15,120
Then you are not a doctor at all

1082
01:55:21,747 --> 01:55:23,169
-Won’t you listen to me?

1083
01:55:25,554 --> 01:55:27,149
What is left to listen to?

1084
01:55:29,553 --> 01:55:34,335
Yes, there is. There’s so
much I said until today?

1085
01:55:35,458 --> 01:55:38,583
I have only been listening
And enduring until now

1086
01:55:39,372 --> 01:55:45,759
You have no right to suspect
me without clarifying with me

1087
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:51,193
Those who have no proof of the truth
Resort to raising there voices

1088
01:57:45,424 --> 01:57:50,683
Sister, I am going, Where?
Even I do not know

1089
01:57:51,263 --> 01:57:53,809
Sunil's suspicion has turned into hatred

1090
01:57:54,035 --> 01:57:57,972
And I do not have any evidence,
by which he can trust me

1091
01:57:58,699 --> 01:58:01,887
Only you know the truth

1092
01:58:02,206 --> 01:58:08,690
If husband does not have any respect for
his wife then she starts burdening him

1093
01:58:09,464 --> 01:58:12,199
If I stay here,
He will be sad to see me

1094
01:58:12,981 --> 01:58:16,920
I don't want this, I
wish he knew the truth,

1095
01:58:17,732 --> 01:58:19,670
So we don't get separated like this

1096
02:00:32,152 --> 02:00:35,068
No!

1097
02:00:46,268 --> 02:00:50,611
Doctor, I want to tell you something.
- I don’t want to hear anything

1098
02:01:49,495 --> 02:01:55,898
Aarti -You -Come with me

1099
02:01:56,514 --> 02:02:00,561
No -Come on -Where?
- Where you should go

1100
02:02:21,470 --> 02:02:23,543
You were going away,
Leaving me all alone?

1101
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:32,165
Vinod told me.. -I came
to do the interiors here

1102
02:02:33,601 --> 02:02:36,029
But I created misunderstanding
Between the two of you

1103
02:02:36,896 --> 02:02:42,012
I can’t even apologise to you

1104
02:02:42,083 --> 02:02:46,238
For the mistake I have made

1105
02:02:48,123 --> 02:02:50,149
You can be a friend

1106
02:02:57,315 --> 02:03:00,018
I know that misunderstanding can

1107
02:03:00,086 --> 02:03:03,245
Cause a lot of problems. But
sometimes the problem itself

1108
02:03:03,576 --> 02:03:11,576
Can solve the misunderstanding. And
thus, I have realized my mistake

1109
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:19,918
I have drifted far away from Aarti.
But now I am closer to

1110
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:22,513
Her than ever before

1111
02:03:30,321 --> 02:03:32,712
I recognize every disease in the world

1112
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:36,978
But you r mind, which is part of life

1113
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:39,884
Couldn't recognize it

1114
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:43,758
Please forgive...

1115
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:29,431
The End…
