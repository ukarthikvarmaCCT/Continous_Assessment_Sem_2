1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,276
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,276 --> 00:00:03,776
Picture yourself on a ship at sea,

3
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:07,250
relishing the fresh and invigorating sea breeze.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,023
Suddenly, a remarkable sight unfolds before you

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:17,821
a colossal missile emerges from the water.

6
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,522
Not just any missile,

7
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,655
but a nuclear missile

8
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:25,100
with the capability to reach a target 
on the other side of the globe,

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,652
spanning thousands of kilometers.

10
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,282
This isn't a mere imagination;

11
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:31,158
it's a reality today, thanks to submarines.

12
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:32,786
The footage you just witnessed

13
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:36,550
was a test of a Trident 2 missile 
conducted by the US Navy,

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,431
launched from a US Ohio-class submarine.

15
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,340
The Trident 2 falls under the category of

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,006
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs),

17
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:48,792
representing one of the most formidable weapons globally.

18
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:53,195
These SLBMs boast an estimated yield of 475 kilotons,

19
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:59,243
a stark contrast to the 12-13 kiloton yield of 
the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

20
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:00,832
Presently, these potent weapons

21
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:02,258
are housed within submarines,

22
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:05,408
stealthily traversing the world's oceans

23
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:08,237
in highly classified, undisclosed locations.

24
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:11,470
In today's video, let's delve into 
the intricacies of these submarines

25
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,538
understanding the technology that propels them

26
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,867
and unravelling their operational mechanisms.

27
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:30,807
Fundamentally, all submarines operate based on

28
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:33,126
Archimedes' principle,

29
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,205
a concept likely familiar from school.

30
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:38,416
As an object sinks,

31
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:41,731
it experiences a buoyant force

32
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:46,390
equivalent to the weight of the fluid displaced

33
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,038
due to this object's sinking.

34
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:52,057
When a submarine's weight 
matches that of the water it displaces,

35
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:54,633
it achieves a level of neutral buoyancy.

36
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:57,596
Allowing it to maintain a constant depth.

37
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:59,892
When the objective is to submerge,

38
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:02,817
the gravitational force applied must exceed

39
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:03,759
the buoyant force,

40
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,125
prompting the use of ballast tanks.

41
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,491
Typically, these two tanks are located at the submarine's ends,

42
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:13,733
they are filled with air at the surface,

43
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,530
enabling the vessel to float.

44
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,020
To descend into the water,

45
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,598
these ballast tanks are flooded with water,

46
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,188
increasing the submarine's weight

47
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:23,004
and initiating the descent.

48
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:25,971
Such scenarios are labelled to have negative buoyancy.

49
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:28,859
It indicates the control of a submarine's depth

50
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:31,714
by adjusting the water level in its ballast tanks.

51
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:34,524
This mechanism governs vertical 
movement for ascending and descending.

52
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:36,775
For lateral movement, 
such as turning sideways in the water,

53
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:39,388
a Rudder is employed.

54
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:41,096
It looks like this.

55
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:43,208
It is known as a Vertical Rudder.

56
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,648
This facilitates horizontal movement in the water.

57
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:50,480
Similar rudders are used in boats, ships, and aircraft.

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,298
Additionally, forward and backward motion 
is achieved through the use of a propeller,

59
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:56,320
essentially a fan.

60
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,681
While navigating underwater,

61
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,542
a reliable means of orientation is essential.

62
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:06,030
Sonar technology serves this purpose.

63
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,840
It operates based on sound.

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,366
There are two main types of sonar technologies:

65
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,448
active sonar and passive sonar.

66
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:17,486
Active sonar involves emitting sound from the submarine.

67
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:20,334
The sound travels through the water,

68
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:24,156
collides with objects, and upon 
reflection back to the submarine,

69
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:27,094
the time and distance calculations

70
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:30,882
provide information about the submarine's 
location and the surrounding environment.

71
00:03:30,882 --> 00:03:33,723
In contrast, passive sonar does not emit sound

72
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:36,960
but rather detects sounds from other 
sources, such as enemy submarines,

73
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,305
by listening to their engine and propeller noises 

74
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,952
to determine their distance.

75
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:48,785
However, the use of sonar technology 
has adverse effects on marine life,

76
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:50,872
impacting creatures like whales and dolphins,

77
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:54,638
which also rely on sonar for communication.

78
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:59,261
To address this concern, some submarines 
are exploring alternative technologies

79
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,250
such as LiDAR,

80
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,501
Light Detection and Ranging.

81
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:07,229
LiDAR employs light to estimate distance

82
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:11,059
and is already integrated into many modern smartphones.

83
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:13,484
Another alternative is using RADAR

84
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:15,603
Radio Detection and Ranging,

85
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:18,899
it is effective above water and in aircrafts

86
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,952
which utilizes radio waves to calculate distances.

87
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:28,201
but is limited underwater due to the 
restricted transmission of radio waves.

88
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,103
Lastly, emerging technologies are being 
explored as potential alternatives like

89
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,337
MRS 
Magnetic Anomaly Detection System

90
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,019
or Gravitational Anomaly Detection System.

91
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,364
However, the bottom line is that today,

92
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,385
the predominant technology employed 
in submarines is Sonar.

93
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:46,286
Multiple Sonar sensors are strategically 
installed around submarines

94
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,330
to continuously collect and monitor data,

95
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,266
ensuring there are no obstacles or hazards in their path.

96
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:56,528
This underscores the vital role of data science,

97
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:59,799
whether in space, on ground or underwater,

98
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,878
it is a necessity in almost every domain.

99
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:08,230
Unsurprisingly, data science has emerged 
as one of the most lucrative career options.

100
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,649

The link is in the description below.

122
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:13,988
Now, let's delve into the inner workings of a submarine.

123
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:18,676
Typically, an armed military submarine 
consists of three levels or decks.

124
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:21,957
This video will mostly focus on military submarines,

125
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:26,463
as they constitute the majority of submarines worldwide.

126
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:30,105
It's worth noting that the designs of 
research and tourism submarines may differ.

127
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:33,734
For instance, the Titan submersible gained attention a few months ago

128
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,250
due to its accident,

129
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,762
and I've covered it in a separate video if you're interested in learning more.

130
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:38,930
If you're interested, you can check out the 
detailed video.

131
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,218
The link is in the description.

132
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:41,831
Now, turning our attention to military submarines.

133
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:44,873
The topmost deck of a military submarine 
is typically outfitted with torpedoes,

134
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:46,511
which serve as weapons.

135
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:48,466
The lowest deck houses battery rooms

136
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:50,487
that supply electricity to the submarine,

137
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:52,917
and sandwiched in between are the diesel machine,

138
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:57,153
motor room, and the nerve center 
known as the control room.

139
00:06:57,153 --> 00:07:00,465
Positioned above the control room, 
you'll usually find a conning tower

140
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:03,813
an essential component serving as 
the submarine's attack center.

141
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:05,761
The conning tower is equipped with various instruments,

142
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:09,704
including periscopes for observing the surroundings,

143
00:07:09,704 --> 00:07:12,870
electronic antennas, and access points for arms.

144
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,779
It also serves as the main entry and exit point

145
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,478
for individuals entering or leaving the submarine.

146
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:24,366
Torpedoes are stored in torpedo tubes.

147
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:27,701
These are basically self-propelled underwater missiles.

148
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:31,841
These tubes are cylindrical containers 
designed to house these cylindrical missiles.

149
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,630
In modern submarines, torpedoes 
are typically placed at the front.

150
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,685
However, in the 2017 Bollywood film 'Ghazi Attack,'

151
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:48,414
the depiction of a submarine featured 
torpedoes at both the front and back.

152
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:51,819
This was historically accurate as powerful submarines back then

153
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,276
indeed had torpedoes at both ends

154
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:57,680
because torpedoes could only travel 
in a straight line at the time.

155
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:04,073
An intriguing aspect is that

156
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:08,417
these torpedo tubes can also be used as 
emergency escape routes from submarines.

157
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:11,543
Nevertheless, escaping through them is no easy feat.

158
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:17,197
The tubes have a narrow diameter, 
measuring only 12.75 inches for light torpedoes

159
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,092
and 21 inches for heavy torpedoes.

160
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,730
First of all, this is an extremely narrow space.

161
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,063
Additionally, individuals attempting to escape 
must wear a 23 kg escape

162
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:27,487
suit due to the immense water pressure at those depths.

163
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:31,926
One can't simply exit the submarine at those depths.

164
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,544
The immense pressure of the water 
would crush the unprepared instantly.

165
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:36,988
Officers working in submarines

166
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:39,859
undergo rigorous training for six months.

167
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:47,962
India's sole military submarine training establishment,

168
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:52,322
INS Satavahana, 
is located in Vishakhapatnam city.

169
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:55,794
At this training facility, numerous replicas 
of torpedo tubes are available

170
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:59,202
for officers to practice emergency escapes.

171
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:00,715
Now, let's delve into the submarine's power source

172
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:03,041
where does it get the energy to operate?

173
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,362
The answer depends on the type of submarine,

174
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:07,842
with two primary categories in India:

175
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:10,134
conventional submarines and nuclear submarines.

176
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:14,177
Conventional submarines utilize large electrical batteries,

177
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:21,193
akin to car batteries, but these 
require recharging every 2-3 days.

178
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,193
To recharge these batteries,

179
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:24,966
a diesel engine is needed.

180
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:27,799
However, operating a diesel engine

181
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,271
necessitates oxygen from the air.

182
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:33,632
Since submarines operate underwater,

183
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:41,676
they must resurface to run the 
diesel engine and recharge the batteries.

184
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,916
In contrast, nuclear submarines don't have this problem. 

185
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:53,517
They employ a nuclear reactor instead 
of a diesel engine to generate electricity.

186
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:57,237
This allows them to remain submerged for extended periods,

187
00:09:57,237 --> 00:10:00,334
limited only by the human factors,

188
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,248
such as the availability of food 
and provisions for the crew.

189
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:07,923
The submarines can remained submerged 
as long as there's sufficient provisions for the crew.

190
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:10,068
Examining the structure of a submarine,

191
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,607
the outer layer is typically composed of rubber.

192
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:15,262
This reason for strategic choice is quite simple actually.

193
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:18,223
Because rubber effectively absorbs sound,

194
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:21,855
making it challenging to detect submarines in the water.

195
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,290
Military submarines are designed to be elusive,

196
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,906
ensuring they are not easily spotted by enemy counterparts.

197
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:31,563
The black layer visible in submarine photos

198
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:32,992
is made of rubber.

199
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:35,436
Moving to the interior, the primary body 
of the submarine within the rubber layer

200
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:36,831
is referred to as the Hull.

201
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:38,796
There are two common types of hulls:

202
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:40,877
single hull and double hull.

203
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:44,380
Single hull submarines have only one layer of the main body,

204
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,238
while double hull submarines consist of two layers of the main body.

205
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:48,748
In the double hull design,

206
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,488
the ballast tank is integrated,

207
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:53,811
with water filling the space between the two layers,

208
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:56,500
effectively serving as a ballast tank.

209
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,518
The clear advantage of a double hull configuration

210
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:00,546
lies in providing an additional layer of protection.

211
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:02,045
In the event of a collision,

212
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,668
a double hull submarine offers enhanced security.

213
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:05,588
Most modern military submarines

214
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:07,815
adopt the double hull design,

215
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:10,403
not only for added protection 
but also to better withstand water pressure

216
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,054
as illustrated by the incident involving the Titan submersible's

217
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,930
implosion under water pressure.

218
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,272
At the water's surface, the atmospheric pressure is 1 atmosphere,

219
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:21,351
equivalent to 1 kilogram per square centimeter.

220
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:24,306
As one descends underwater, pressure increases.

221
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:26,152
For every 10 meters of depth,

222
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,488
there's an additional 1 kilogram per square meter of pressure.

223
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:34,641
Military submarines are typically designed 
to operate at depths of 300-400 meters,

224
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:38,314
with some capable of reaching depths of 500 meters.

225
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:41,714
At this depth, the pressure reaches 50 atmospheres

226
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:44,437
50 times greater than at the surface.

227
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,208
Obviously, constructing submarine 
hulls requires robust materials.

228
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,717
Not using the right materials

229
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:52,589
might cause failures or accidents. 

230
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,658
As with the Titan submersible.

231
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:59,759
Military submarines use high-quality steel alloys,

232
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,725
blending steel with titanium, carbon, 
aluminium, and other elements.

233
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,511
The complexity of designing a submarine is underscored

234
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:11,602
by the fact that it takes approximately 
10 years to design a diesel-electric submarine,

235
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:16,420
while a nuclear submarine demands a 
minimum of 15-17 years at the designing stage.

236
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,160
This intricacy is why India often outsources submarine design

237
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,413
to other countries, such as Russia, Germany, or France.

238
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,585
However, India manufactures its own submarines.

239
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:34,101
India's first domestically manufactured 
submarine was INS Shalki,

240
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:39,234
launched in 1987 during 
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's tenure.

241
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:43,173
and commissioned by the Indian Navy in 1992.

242
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:46,005
On Indian Navy's website, you will see that

243
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:48,919
there are different categories of submarines,

244
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,745
which are divided into classes.

245
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:52,586
In India, there are four classes.

246
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:57,665
Sindhughosh, Shishumar, Kalvari, and Arihant.

247
00:12:57,665 --> 00:12:59,653
The first three classes

248
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,545
are of conventional submarines:

249
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:04,741
the Sindhughosh class comprises Russian diesel-powered EKMs,

250
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:08,289
the Shishumar class features German SSKs,

251
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:12,812
and the Kalvari class showcases new French-designed and Indian-built SCORPENEs.

252
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:15,627
Here, EKMs, SSKs, and SCORPENEs

253
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:18,436
are the nomenclature used for submarines in other countries.

254
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:22,391
But we classify these submarines into these classes,

255
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:24,371
These classes of submarines

256
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,503
can be compared to the models of cars.

257
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:28,512
Specifically, Sindhughosh comprises 7 submarines,

258
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:29,940
Shishumar has 4,

259
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,639
and the Kalvari class has 5 operational submarines.

260
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,886
Detailed information about each submarine, 
including names, can be found on the Indian Navy website,

261
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:39,080
and the link is provided in the description below.

262
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,933
Moving to the category of nuclear submarines,

263
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:44,829
India has named its class Arihant,

264
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:49,253
Currently, there are two active nuclear submarines in this class,

265
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:52,383
with two more under construction in Vishakhapatnam.

266
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:55,772
The Arihant-class submarines have the 
capability to carry ballistic missiles,

267
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:58,511
Ballistic missiles are self-guided missiles

268
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:00,658
that can be equipped with nuclear bombs.

269
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:06,927
INS Arihant is presently armed with 
K-15 submarine-launched ballistic missile,

270
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:10,109
an SLBM like the one I mentioned earlier in the video.

271
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:14,818
The range of the K-15 missile is 
between 750 km and 1,900 km.

272
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:17,111
Talking about the other developed countries,

273
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:19,764
the American Navy's Ohio-class submarines

274
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:22,549
are considered among the most powerful in the world.

275
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:25,463
The U.S. possesses a total of 18 Ohio-class submarines,

276
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:31,434
each capable of carrying 24 Trident 2 ballistic missiles.

277
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:37,373
Furthermore, each Trident 2 missile can 
potentially accommodate 14 nuclear bombs.

278
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,175
When the United States and Russia

279
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:42,358
aimed to decrease the number of nuclear weapons they had,

280
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:44,452
they entered into the START 1 agreement.

281
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:48,982
The terms of the agreement specified 
a reduction limit from 14 to 8.

282
00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:51,914
This START I treaty, officially known 
as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,

283
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:54,867
was the first treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union

284
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:57,353
to reduce strategic nuclear weapons.

285
00:14:57,506 --> 00:15:01,147
Beyond these, the U.S. Navy features other submarine classes,

286
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:04,633
such as Los Angeles, Columbia, and Virginia classes.

287
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:10,267
In Russia, the Yasen class stands out as the 
most powerful nuclear attack submarine.

288
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:12,784
Besides India, Russia, and the U.S., other countries like

289
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:17,323
China, the UK, France, and Germany 
also possess similar submarines.

290
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:20,315
The actual capacity of these submarines in terms of personnel

291
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:23,290
varies between submarines

292
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,451
and the actual data is confidential in these countries

293
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,094
due to military reasons.

294
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,329
The estimated capacity of a submarine 
generally ranges between 50 and 80 people,

295
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:34,328
50 to 80 people can be onboard these submaries.

296
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:36,773
With nuclear submarines being even larger,

297
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:40,152
it can accommodate approximately 100 individuals.

298
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:44,636
The size of these submarines is truly 
remarkable, as depicted in the video.

299
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:46,006
It's unbelievable.

300
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:49,100
For those eager to witness these marvels in person,

301
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,119
a visit to Vishakhapatnam, home to a 
submarine museum, is recommended.

302
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:57,960
The museum features INS Kursura, 
a retired Indian Navy submarine

303
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,227
commissioned in 1969.

304
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:04,045
Notably, the museum was inaugurated in 2002

305
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,777
by the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh,

306
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,427
Mr Chandra Babu Naidu.

307
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:12,421
If you desire the firsthand experience 
of being inside a submarine,

308
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:16,577
tourism submarines or research 
submarines offer such opportunities.

309
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:20,099
Typically, non-military submarines do not 
venture too deep into the water.

310
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:22,156
The Titan submersible was an exception.

311
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:25,597
Such deep-sea submarines are 
rare in the tourism sector.

312
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:28,964
A few companies in Europe, the USA, and the UK,

313
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:31,392
provide submarine and submersible dives.

314
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:34,893
Such as the companies Atlantis and Seabourn.

315
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,978
They offer expeditions to locations like Alaska.

316
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:41,652
I trust you've gained valuable insights from this video.

317
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:44,396
Check out Scaler with the link in the description below.

318
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:48,638

320
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:53,527
It's a truly heart-wrenching story.

321
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:54,825
Thank you very much!
