00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,118
Friends, when you imagine the Middle East,

2
00:00:02,118 --> 00:00:03,994
you probably think of deserts.

3
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:06,398
But Oman is quite special.

4
00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:08,444
It has date palm forests

5
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:09,592
and tall mountains.

6
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:12,150
Here, you can swim with turtles,

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,811
and, in Oman, you can also see

8
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:16,454
one of the most dangerous forts in the world.

9
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:20,380
A fort that could never be breached by an enemy.

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,932
Because its defence system was so immaculate

11
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:25,192
that you'll be shocked to see it.

12
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,540
The security system of this fort

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,459
was truly amazing back then.

14
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:34,796
If you tried to enter the fort from this gate,

15
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:39,623
the soldiers could throw rocks from above to k!ll you.

16
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:41,535
So even before you enter,

17
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:43,540
you can see the first post,

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,923
from where they would throw rocks on you.

19
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:48,873
If you escape this,

20
00:00:48,873 --> 00:00:50,412
you will reach the Pitfall 1,

21
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:55,263
where they would throw hot oil or date syrup on you.

22
00:00:57,104 --> 00:00:58,451
The date syrup.

23
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:02,342
That's where the hot oil would be poured on you.

24
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:05,937
So you better be quick to escape it.

25
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:08,090
Now, they've covered this with glass,

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,792
or else, you could have fallen into the pit.

27
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:11,401
When you would run from the hot oil,

28
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:12,624
you would fall into this pit.

29
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,380
And if you escaped it too,

30
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,057
you would reach the Pitfall 2.

31
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:17,656
They could drop something from here,

32
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:19,073
the M*rder Hole 2 is right above it.

33
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:21,084
You could fall into this pit and perish.

34
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:23,252
Catch enemies off guard,

35
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,680
in the dark passageway.

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,422
It was dark,

37
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:26,607
there were no lamps like here.

38
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:27,236
Yeah. 

39
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:29,028
So some of the stairs had wooden planks

40
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:30,390
that could be removed to expose

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,043
deep, gaping pits.

42
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:33,622
And then you would be at the third pitfall.

43
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,684
And the fourth after that.

44
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,817
And the fifth.

45
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,395
So, not just once but

46
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:41,221
you would have to escape five times,

47
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,192
if you want to breach this fort.

48
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,000
We've safely escaped 2 pitfalls,

49
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,799
Let's move on to the third pitfall.

50
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,197
Oh! This is the third pitfall.

51
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:51,053
As soon as you open this door,

52
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:52,345
you have this door here,

53
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,298
as soon as you step through it, 
you'll fall into the pitfall.

54
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:58,019
There's a door before every pitfall.

55
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,162
These people were so clever,

56
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,853
the doors would be closed,

57
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:03,654
and when you try to open the doors,

58
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:05,010
they will pour oil on you,

59
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,465
and if you manage to open it,

60
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:07,370
you will fall into the pit.

61
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,904
And after passing through all these stages,

62
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:11,189
I don't know if there has 
been a single intruder in history,

63
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,732
who reached the top.

64
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,824
If he did,

65
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:15,999
this is the view he would have seen.

66
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,812
These are the places

67
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:20,728
from where you would pour the hot oil.

68
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,797
It can really go deep inside.

69
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:25,093
300 years ago,

70
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:27,284
Nizwa was the capital of Oman.

71
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:28,841
That's why today,

72
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:31,383
Nizwa is an important tourist attraction.

73
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:32,404
The city of Nizwa.

74
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:34,038
And this fort,

75
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:36,362
back then, the Sultan of Oman,

76
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:39,742
lived here and ruled over Oman.

77
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:53,768
The best thing about Oman

78
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:56,330
in comparison to the other Middle Eastern countries,

79
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,887
is that this is a sparsely populated country.

80
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,153
Wherever you go, there won't be a crowd.

81
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:01,685
You'll see very few people.

82
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:05,533
So you can take your time to explore everything.

83
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:07,252
Like, you can see the fort,

84
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:08,543
this is a major tourist attraction,

85
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,858
but you can hardly see anyone else here.

86
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,904
I'm the guy who has been assigned

87
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:15,263
the duty of throwing the stones today.

88
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,872
Oh, you're throwing the stones today?

89
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,707
On the intruders.

90
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:22,061
Okay, I'll be the one who pours the oil then.

91
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:24,078
I'll be over here, okay?

92
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:24,951
Yeah!

93
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:27,623
The wood on the door,

94
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,865
this is the same wood from those days.

95
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:32,333
This is walnut wood.

96
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,193
Even in their shooting style,

97
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:37,719
they had some nice designs.

98
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,414
Like, if someone was close to the fort,

99
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:41,977
and they had to shoot him,

100
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:44,112
this is the slit they'd use,

101
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,410
so that they could shoot downwards.

102
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:46,854
But if the target was far,

103
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:48,137
this is the hole for that,

104
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:50,181
they could shoot from here.

105
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:51,966
And there's another angle here.

106
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,726
So they could shoot in three different angles.

107
00:03:55,997 --> 00:04:00,094
These 3 angles were all around 360° of the fort.

108
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,396
So you can imagine the

109
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:04,414
level of protection of this fort.

110
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:07,005
There's a well in this castle fort.

111
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,080
Look at how deep it goes.

112
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,923
You can see my reflection at the bottom.

113
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,580
-Oh, my God.
-Zoom in.

114
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:21,708
This is a big area,

115
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,032
that includes the Nizwa Souq, Nizwa Fort,

116
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,316
a historical wall,

117
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:30,091
that was used to protect the fort from enemies.

118
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,713
We're walking on this wall now.

119
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:34,291
You can see some old buildings here,

120
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,912
some parts are being renovated,

121
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:38,136
some have been renovated already. 

122
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:40,442
But look at how extraordinary it looks.

123
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:45,587
It feels like you have time-travelled 
to 2,000 years into the past.

124
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,670
Don't be distracted by my cap,

125
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,168
there's 'Australia' written on it,

126
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,770
I wore this because I didn't have any other caps.

127
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,684
And it's too sunny here.

128
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,529
And if you remember the Australia vlogs,

129
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:06,117
I got this cap for free in Australia,

130
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:07,636
so I'm wearing this cap.

131
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:09,626
After this, we went to the Nizwa Souq.

132
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:11,266
The old city market,

133
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:13,611
that looks like a historical place.

134
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:21,769
Omani dates.

135
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:23,640
Look at the varieties here.

136
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,310
Less sweets ones, okay.

137
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,516
There are dates everywhere.

138
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,955
You will know the difference 
between this one and that.

139
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:34,203
-This one's good, right?
-I like this.

140
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,188
I think this is the fourth variety I've tried.

141
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:39,820
At home, mostly we have the Medjool ones.

142
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,854
There are more than 200 varieties of dates in Oman.

143
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:45,829
They have so many types of dates in this shop.

144
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,719
You'll be exhausted by the time you've tried them all.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,470
They have seedless dates,

146
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,864
date honey,

147
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:56,661
and the tahini sauce to dip the dates.

148
00:05:56,661 --> 00:06:00,057
This machine is making sesame sauce.

149
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,356
The sesame seeds are put into it.

150
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:04,924
And this machine is grinding the seeds

151
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,475
to make the sauce.

152
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:08,011
You can see it here.

153
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:12,743
And the sauce then drips into this pot 
where it is collected.

154
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:14,921
Oh, wow, there's so much sauce.

155
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,557
You can smell it also.

156
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:19,206
They have given us this sample to try.

157
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:23,257
Pure tahini sauce.

158
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,215
It is warm!

159
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:30,427
The contrast between 
this sauce and the dates

160
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:31,764
tastes quite good,

161
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:33,783
because it tastes a bit sour,

162
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,072
and the dates are sweet.

163
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,310
So when the tastes mix,

164
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,783
it makes a good snack.

165
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:40,279
So we decided to buy 1 packet of dates.

166
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,126
But they actually gifted it to us.

167
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:43,995
They would not accept any payment.

168
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:45,653
Very, very sweet.

169
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:47,706
Though it was pretty affordable, to be honest. 

170
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:50,328
0.800 Rial.
[$2.08 or ₹172.35]

171
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:51,456
800 Baiza.

172
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:53,246
A Rial is divided into 1,000 Baiza.

173
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,347
This dagger that you see here,

174
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:57,593
this is the logo of Oman.

175
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:59,038
Even on Oman's flag,

176
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,451
there's a dagger in a corner.

177
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:04,710
In ceremonies and special occasions,

178
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,807
people carry such daggers.

179
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,735
If you are interested in visiting Oman,

180
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:10,469
you can try Gainwell Travel,

184
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:19,408
You can check it out.

185
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:24,241
So this is a banana 
and a palm tree plantation.

186
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:27,051
You can see we're walking on the irrigation system,

187
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,866
so we don't wanna step on anything.

188
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,580
There are no dates on any of these trees,

189
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,525
but when they are, they look like this.

190
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:34,605
They grow in bunches.

191
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:37,196
There can be more than a thousand dates in a bunch.

192
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:40,228
Oman's population is less than 5 million.

193
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:44,342
But there are more than 7 million date palm trees.

194
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:45,912
Can you imagine that

195
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:49,775
there are more date trees 
than people in this country?

196
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:52,273
There was a small hill here.

197
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:54,794
The view from here is simply amazing. 

198
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:58,692
You can see the date palm tree 
plantation spread over this area.

199
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:02,198
And behind it, you can see 
some interesting, historical civilisations. 

200
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,580
We finished checking into the second hotel now,

201
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,439
and as soon as we entered the room,

202
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,839
look at what we found.

203
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,949
A huge YouTube cake.

204
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,976
Welcome to Al Bustan Palace.

205
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,479
That's the name of this hotel.

206
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,088
And they have my latest photo on 
top of this YouTube cake.

207
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:28,548
Probably edible.

208
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:31,266
And the Play Button, Subscribe,

209
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:33,878
wait a second, Dislike?

210
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:36,292
No, no, no, let's remove the Dislike,

211
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,275
-Dislike also?
-We don't need it here.

212
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:41,086
These cakes look really interesting.

213
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,626
They look really good.

214
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:45,120
But unfortunately, it's not 
possible to eat so much sugar,

215
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,407
it's just too much.

216
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,019
If you take an hour-long speedboat ride from Muscat,

217
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,902
you will reach Al Daymaniyat Island.

218
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:03,186
It is a protected nature reserve

219
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,958
and a wonderful site for eco-tourism.

220
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,528
So we're on the beautiful island now.

221
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:10,685
We're the only ones on this island.

222
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:13,312
-The only ones?
-Look, there's no one else around here.

223
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:15,563
-We're about to go snorkelling.
-Yeah.

224
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:16,860
There's a small problem.

225
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,915
Someone, one of us, I won't say who

226
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:21,968
forgot their swimming pants.

227
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,047
So they have to go in undie.

228
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,111
Underwater, you'll find more than 
100 species of corals,

229
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,935
more than 280 species of fish,

230
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:34,820
but if the thing this place is most famous for,

231
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,429
are the turtles.

232
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:39,417
The endangered species of green turtles,

233
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:41,567
often come here to nest,

234
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,010
and while snorkelling,

235
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,124
these turtles can get very close to you.

236
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:47,682
In this video, you can see

237
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:49,438
that they aren't scared of humans.

238
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:56,199
Now, we're at a special museum in Oman.

239
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,492
The building is so unique that

240
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:01,416
I'm in a science-fiction movie.

241
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:06,426
Not in 2024, but in 2124.

242
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:08,474
It looks so crazy.

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,586
Look behind you.

244
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,964
This building feels like it's AI-generated.

245
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:14,227
It's so perfect.

246
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:16,547
Everything looks so proper

247
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:20,601
you won't even find a single 
dust particle on this floor.

248
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:23,369
This is the biggest museum in Oman.

249
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:25,179
Oman Across the Ages.

250
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:35,105
The museum building is so huge that

251
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:39,635
there is more than 900,000 m² of exhibition space here.

252
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:41,889
And in some galleries, the ceiling is so high,

253
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,961
some are more than 20m high.

254
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:48,149
The hunter-gatherers who lived in Oman 6,000 years ago,

255
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,484
lived in such huts.

256
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:58,569
These are some historical 
Omani sea routes over here.

257
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,340
Look at this, the screen is so big,

258
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,834
but there are gaps between the screen.

259
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,662
To go further into the museum,

260
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:13,339
you can pass through the gaps in the screen.

261
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:18,403
This museum has been designed very creatively.

262
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:20,366
There's another screen on the other side.

263
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:22,430
Friends, here you can clearly see,

264
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,362
the Omani national emblem.

265
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:25,528
That has two swords and a dagger.

266
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:28,395
This is the passport of Oman's previous Sultan.

267
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,489
You can see it.

268
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,210
Along with his Driver's License and ID Card.

269
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,433
You can see the number on the ID Card,

270
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:35,330
00000001.

271
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,105
Most of the things that you saw in this vlog,

272
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:43,710
were from around Muscat.

273
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,410
But apart from this, in Oman, you can see deserts,

274
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,319
the highest mountain in the Gulf,

275
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:51,451
as well as the Gulf's Grand Canyon.

276
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:53,752
We showed the Grand Canyon in the previous vlog,

277
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:56,846
you can click here to watch it too.
