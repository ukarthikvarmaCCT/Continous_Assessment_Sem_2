00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,946
Hello friends!

2
00:00:00,946 --> 00:00:03,959
Recently a film called The Kerala Story was released,

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,173
which is being talked about a lot.

4
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:06,656
In this film, it is shown how

5
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,718
a secret plot is underway in Kerala,

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,637
to forcefully convert innocent women to Islam

7
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:15,958
and then they are being sent to IS*S.

8
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,019
According to this film and the director of this film,

9
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,777
this has been done to approximately 32,000 girls,

10
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:24,507
who are now buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen.

11
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:26,315
What is the real story behind this?

12
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:28,264
How much truth is in it?

13
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:31,063
Come, let's try to find out in this video.

14
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,444
"The Kerala Story"

15
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:36,827
"32,000 girls like me

16
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:37,953
were forced to convert

17
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:40,283
and now they're buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen."

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,719
About 100 years ago,

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,677
Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Germany, wrote a book

20
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:47,155
called Mein Kampf.

21
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:48,905
In this book, he talked about

22
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:52,447
a propaganda technique called Big Lie.

23
00:00:52,447 --> 00:00:57,276
Hitler said that to manipulate people, you need to lie so outrageously to

24
00:00:57,276 --> 00:01:00,277
make people think that no one can make up such an outrageous lie.

25
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:03,397
To make them think that there must be some truth in it.

26
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,358
When an outrageous lie is told with so much confidence,

27
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,259
some people believe it to be true.

28
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:10,828
People think that no one can lie so much.

29
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:14,935
Additionally, another propaganda technique as told by 

30
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:18,231
Hitler's propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels.

31
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,955
Goebbels said that repetition is also very important here.

32
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,816
Keep repeating this big lie again and again.

33
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:25,718
Repeat this big lie so many times that

34
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:29,188
people get to hear the same lie from 4 different sources.

35
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:31,448
By doing this, people become more convinced.

36
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:34,768
A third technique is said to be the Half-Truth.

37
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:37,565
Sometimes, add in some element of truth in your speeches.

38
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:41,195
Because, nowadays, some people can easily identify big liars.

39
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:44,128
When someone says that no one can lie so outrageously all the time,

40
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:46,907
someone might counter that by showing that the speaker is a total fraud.

41
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,274
Someone who might've been an Olympic champion 

42
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,110
had lying been an Olympic sport.

43
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,555
For those who are not convinced by the big lies,

44
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:54,189
half truth is supposed to convince them.

45
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,239
Why am I telling you all these propaganda techniques?

46
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,131
Because in this video you'll see,

47
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:02,696
how these 3 techniques have been used to mislead people.

48
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:05,731
The Kerala Story film's director Sudipto Sen was asked

49
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,384
which true incidents inspired this film.

50
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:10,051
He said many things here.

51
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:11,969
First, he said that in 2010,

52
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:14,895
Kerala's former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy,

53
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:17,430
he gave a statement in Kerala's Assembly.

54
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,506
You can Google this statement

55
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,726
and you will see a report from India Today.

56
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:25,267
2,500 women, Islam, Kerala, Oommen Chandy,

57
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:26,177
seems right.

58
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:28,913
Then it was said that another former Chief Minister of Kerala,

59
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:30,883
V.S. Achuthanandan had once said that

60
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,675
Kerala is going to become an Islamic state in the next 20 years.

61
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,624
If you search this on Google

62
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:37,415
and you see this video on YouTube or Twitter.

63
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,419
You think, oh, this is also right.

64
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:40,864
Then in the teaser of the film, it is shown that

65
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,070
a girl says that she is Fatima

66
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,755
and that she is imprisoned in Afghanistan's jail.

67
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:46,517
You search this on Google

68
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:48,467
and you see a news article from The Hindu.

69
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:51,458
Fatima, Afghanistan's jail, Islamic State.

70
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,592
Was that right too?

71
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:54,773
Friends, these were some good examples

72
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:55,755
of half-truth.

73
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:58,447
Most people skim through the headlines,

74
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:00,323
and don't go into detail.

75
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:01,906
Let's talk about the first article.

76
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:04,293
This article was published in India Today in 2012.

77
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,706
Kerala's former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy

78
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:09,257
informed the state legislature

79
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:11,796
that between 2006 to 2012,

80
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:16,182
2,667 women converted to Islam.

81
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:18,352
Approximately 2,500 women in 6 years.

82
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:20,130
But the thing to note is

83
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,879
did he ever use the term 'forced conversions'?

84
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,557
He said that they will not allow any forced conversions in their state

85
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:30,132
and neither will they tolerate hate campaigns against Muslims

86
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:31,525
with accusations of Love Jihad.

87
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,555
Was it mentioned anywhere

88
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:36,723
that these converted women were joining IS*S?

89
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:37,989
Not at all.

90
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,617
Let's see the second citation.

91
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:42,592
The interview of the former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan.

92
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:46,218
He was the Chief Minister of Kerala from 2006 to 2011.

93
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:48,973
The video that is being circulated, from back then,

94
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:51,070
was uploaded by Sunshine Pictures.

95
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,965
The same company which made this film.

96
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,045
First of all,

97
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:56,661
they messed with the English subtitles.

98
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:58,525
The words that are being said by him

99
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,824
and the subtitles that appear here, are not the same.

100
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,034
Secondly, here V.S. Achuthanandan

101
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,819
was strongly criticizing PFI saying that

102
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,682
the PFI was trying to influence the youth of other religions

103
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,250
by paying them to marry Muslim women.

104
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,233
IS*S is not mentioned here either.

105
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:18,406
Secondly, it's been 13 years since this statement.

106
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:20,687
Kerala as a state is still as safe and secular

107
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,200
as it was 13 years ago.

108
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,562
Now let's see the next article from June 2021.

109
00:04:25,562 --> 00:04:28,418
This article talks about 4 women from Kerala

110
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,699
who went to Afghanistan with their husbands

111
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,631
to join the Islamic State of Khorasan Province

112
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,583
between 2016 and 2018.

113
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,694
Their husbands were killed in various attacks.

114
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,212
Their names are Nimisha alias Fathima Isa,

115
00:04:41,212 --> 00:04:43,968
Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha,

116
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:46,257
Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam,

117
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:47,577
and Reffeala.

118
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:49,995
If you look at NIA's list from 2016

119
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:52,732
of the 20 most wanted Indians in Islamic State

120
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:54,784
you will see the names of these 4 women here.

121
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,371
Additionally, there are 2 more women.

122
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:58,125
Ajmala and Shamasia.

123
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,151
Their husbands were cousins.

124
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:04,074
You can see the photos of the husbands of these 6 women here.

125
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:06,356
3 of these 6 women were already Muslims.

126
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:08,854
2 converted to Islam from Christianity.

127
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:11,601
And 1 converted to Islam from Hinduism.

128
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:14,052
So, only one of these women was originally Hindu.

129
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,608
Her name was Nimisha Nair.

130
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:20,387
Was Nimisha Nair trapped by a Muslim man in a case of love jihad?

131
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,302
To find out the answer, let's see

132
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:23,857
who is Nimisha's husband.

133
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:24,617
Eeza.

134
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:28,301
Eeza is a man who converted to Islam from Christianity.

135
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,757
His old name was Bexon Vincent.

136
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:32,311
Bexon's brother, Bestin,

137
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,810
also converted to Islam from Christianity.

138
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,161
And he too was the husband of one of these 4 women. 

139
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,096
So, both the brothers and their wives

140
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:42,381
were all converts and brainwashed.

141
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:43,877
Recently, the Indian government

142
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:47,168
denied these four women permission to get back to India.

143
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,826
You can watch the video interviews of three of these women

144
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:52,365
of Nimisha, Sonia Sebastian and Reffeala

145
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:54,245
on YouTube online

146
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:56,970
on the YouTube channel StratNews Global.

147
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,860
They gave an interview in 2020.

148
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,986
And there you can see how these women looked,

149
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,470
how they talked and their behaviour.

150
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,197
When there was a caliphate,

151
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:08,430
when I was there 

152
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,798
I was happy there.

153
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:11,530
I can never say that

154
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:14,258
Khilafa (caliphate) was wrong.

155
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:15,530
That it was wrong.

156
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,466
I can't say that because

157
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:18,480
I had a comfortable life here."

158
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,688
Anyone watching this video can see

159
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,441
how brainwashed and radicalized these women still are.

160
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:25,932
But the main character of the film The Kerala Story

161
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:29,366
constantly tries to evoke sympathy.

162
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:32,990
The helplessness and innocence shown in the film

163
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,704
there's perhaps not even a glimpse of it in the videos of real life,

164
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:38,204
I want to ask you,

165
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:41,604
will you have sympathy for these real life women?

166
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:43,799
Or will you call them brainwashed idiots?

167
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,929
Would you want them to remain in Afghanistan's jail

168
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,639
or would you want the Indian government to bring them back to India

169
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,880
only to put them in Indian jail?

170
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,437
I leave this question to you.

171
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:54,827
Comment below with your opinion.

172
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:57,138
Strategic News Global Report tells us that

173
00:06:57,138 --> 00:07:00,914
the 20 people mentioned in the 2016 NIA chargesheet

174
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:03,660
were very interconnected with each other

175
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,021
when it comes to radicalization.

176
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:09,171
17 of them came from a single district.

177
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,128
From Kasaragod district in Kerala.

178
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:13,740
A 2020 report from the Hindustan Times stated that 

179
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,131
some more people joined later

180
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:17,829
so in total, there were 22 people from Kasaragod.

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,373
This article in India Today from 2016 states that

182
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:24,633
the trend shows that not only single youths are joining IS*S,

183
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,326
but the whole family

184
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,636
including husband, wife, and even the children

185
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,767
have gone and joined IS*S.

186
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,781
It is also mentioned in the article that

187
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:35,133
most of the IS*S recruits before this

188
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,889
were from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana.

189
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:38,967
Not from Kerala.

190
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,591
But this Strat News Global Report goes on to say that

191
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:46,811
by 2018, 60 Indians had travelled to Afghanistan.

192
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:48,461
Of which 26 were males,

193
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:49,924
13 women and 21 children.

194
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:52,102
After knowing all of this, it can be clearly said that

195
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:53,858
there is definitely a problem here.

196
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:56,839
People are being radicalized, brainwashed

197
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,170
to join IS*S.

198
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,597
New modes of communication have opened up through the internet.

199
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:05,693
In 2019, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy said that

200
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,607
Indian investigators have found that

201
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:12,292
IS*S is using the dark web and encrypted platforms

202
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:16,983
to radicalize people and recruit t3rr*rists.

203
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:18,534
But the question here is

204
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:20,293
how big is this problem?

205
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:24,909
The film said that this has already happened to 32,000 women in Kerala.

206
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:26,712
But let's see the statistics.

207
00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:27,992
Vladimir Voronkov,

208
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:31,939
the Undersecretary General of the United Nations Office of Counter Terr*rism.

209
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:34,272
He said that from 110 countries,

210
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:37,302
nearly 40,000 foreign t3rr*rist fighters

211
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:40,386
went to Syria and Iraq to join the conflict.

212
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,933
40,000 individuals from 110 countries.

213
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,460
Another estimate was given by the 2018 study by

214
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,856
the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization of King's College, London.

215
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:52,256
41,490 people from 80 different countries

216
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:53,590
are affiliated with IS*S.

217
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,076
79% of them are men.

218
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:57,597
On the basis of these two reports,

219
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:59,062
we can arrive at an estimate

220
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:02,395
there are around 40,000-42,000 foreign t3rr*rists

221
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:04,908
who have gone to join IS*S from all over the world.

222
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:06,264
So, how many of them are from India?

223
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:08,303
The Bureau of Counter-Terr*rism of the US

224
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:10,788
published country reports in 2020.

225
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:12,998
It stated that by September 2020,

226
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:16,927
the NIA had investigated 34 cases of t3rr*rism

227
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:21,765
and arrested 160 people related to IS*S in India.

228
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:24,148
Let's see another source for double-checking.

229
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:28,031
Observer Research Foundation published a paper in October 2019.

230
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:29,907
They said that the number of pro-IS*S cases in India

231
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:34,810
between 2014 and 2018 was around 180-200.

232
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,939
This estimate of 200 people

233
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,520
doesn't include only those people

234
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,099
who actually left India to join IS*S.

235
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:44,070
It also includes those people who spread IS*S propaganda

236
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,535
on the internet in India.

237
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:46,967
Let's look at a third source.

238
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:49,484
In 2019, the Indian Home Ministry said that

239
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:51,838
this number was at 155.

240
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:53,136
The next question is that

241
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:55,006
since these are the cases from all over India,

242
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,676
How many cases are there in Kerala?

243
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:59,066
Out of the total 180-200 cases,

244
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,718
40 cases are said to be from Kerala.

245
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,954
200 from India
and 40 from Kerala.

246
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:07,760
But this number doesn't tell us how many people actually went to join IS*S.

247
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,140
Because the number includes all people affiliated with IS*S

248
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,963
and people who spread propaganda.

249
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:15,516
How many people actually left India to join IS*S?

250
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,804
US Department of State report revealed that

251
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:21,104
there were around 66 known Indian-origin fighters

252
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,063
who were affiliated with IS*S

253
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,627
as of November 2020.

254
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:25,670
You heard it right,

255
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,183
only 66.

256
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:30,713
2018's Strat News global report also gave a figure close to 60,

257
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,584
so both numbers are quite close.

258
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:34,223
Out of these 60,

259
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:35,487
how many were women?

260
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:36,846
Approximately 13 women.

261
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:38,747
How many women were from Kerala?

262
00:10:38,747 --> 00:10:41,114
Only 6 women were from Kerala.

263
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:42,781
Out of these 6, how many women

264
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,058
were converted to Islam from other religions?

265
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,399
3 women.

266
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,727
Out of these 3, 2 were Christians

267
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,418
and only 1 was a Hindu.

268
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:50,911
The events shown in the film

269
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,540
happened to 3 women in real life

270
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,858
but not in the manner,

271
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:55,995
shown in the film.

272
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:57,799
However, the film claims that

273
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,385
this happened to 32,000 women.

274
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:02,057
This is the Big Lie, friends.

275
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,471
This lie is so big that

276
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:04,900
if a common man hears it,

277
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,192
he will think that even if not 32,000,

278
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:08,809
there must still be some truth in it.

279
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,397
This must have happened to a few 1,000 women.

280
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,692
If not thousands,

281
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,259
then it must have happened to hundreds of women.

282
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,200
No! Only 3 women.

283
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,527
Now some of you might say,

284
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,358
whether it's 32,000 or 3,
what difference does it make?

285
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:20,613
The story remains the same.

286
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,687
What's the problem?

287
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:22,708
There are many problems.

288
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,440
First, if instead of 32,000, the meagre number of 3 was used,

289
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,740
then the whole concept of the film fails.

290
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,206
Saying that there is a secret love jihad conspiracy going on here,

291
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:35,717
to forcibly convert girls and send them to IS*S,

292
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:37,536
and as a result of this conspiracy,

293
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:38,891
only 3 women suffered,

294
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:40,789
then it means that these are individual cases.

295
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:42,236
There is no conspiracy here.

296
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:46,316
Second, to generalize and exaggerate things to this level

297
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:48,958
is simply stupid.

298
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,347
If this was done with any other incident

299
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:52,828
you will say that it is utter nonsense.

300
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,302
Let me use an example.

301
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:55,439
Over the last few months,

302
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:57,123
there were 3 such cases of

303
00:11:57,123 --> 00:12:02,864
an Indian citizen urinating on a co-passenger in an airplane.

304
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:06,120
Now imagine, a country like America or Japan

305
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,004
makes a film called The India Story

306
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:11,147
and the film shows how Indians

307
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,211
always urinate on co-passengers in airplanes.

308
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,573
32,000 such incidents too place

309
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:18,923
where Indians have urinated on someone.

310
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,301
How will you feel about it?

311
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:22,334
You will say that it is utter nonsense.

312
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,555
That they are trying to defame the country.

313
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:27,165
But if on the other hand, the filmmaker says

314
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,341
that 32,000 was an exaggerated number

315
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,578
but it did happen thrice,

316
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:33,373
so making the film was justified.

317
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,385
What would be your response in that case?

318
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:36,680
Does it make any sense?

319
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,009
Similarly, the entire state of Kerala is being defamed for 3 individual cases.

320
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,870
When the director of the film was asked about it,

321
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,292
about the source of the 32,000 number

322
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,736
he evaded the questions.

323
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,869
While talking to Alt News, he said that

324
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,353
only after the release of the film would he share his data

325
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,825
based on which he used the number 32,000.

326
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:57,286
He told The Quint that

327
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:58,873
asking such questions doesn't make any difference.

328
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:00,178
"It is very cliched."

329
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,061
When the film was screened in JNU,

330
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:05,295
he said that the 32,000 number was an arbitrary number.

331
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:07,275
And when the matter reached the court,

332
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:11,566
he removed 32,000 from the description of the film

333
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:12,660
replacing it with 3.

334
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,136
The truth is that

335
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:16,709
the story of these three women was worth telling.

336
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,598
Had this story been told

337
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,610
without lies and propaganda.

338
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,826
Every person who is brainwashed

339
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:25,743
and recruited in IS*S is a potential threat.

340
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:28,857
But how big is this problem in India?

341
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:30,738
If you compare it with other countries,

342
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:33,072
you will find it shocking.

343
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:36,238
In India, as I told you, this number is around 66,

344
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:38,495
the victims of IS*S propaganda.

345
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:41,287
According to the 2016 data,

346
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,537
in the former Soviet republics, there were 7,000 such people.

347
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:47,123
2,500 people from Russia.

348
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:49,555
1,700 people in France.

349
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:51,216
760 people in Germany.

350
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:53,350
The number of victims in the UK was also around 700.

351
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,044
The population of all these countries is much less than India.

352
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,717
But the number of people who fell victim to IS*S

353
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,747
is much higher in these countries.

354
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:03,572
And here, it is also worth noting that

355
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:07,075
India has the 3rd largest Muslim population in the world.

356
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:09,129
So, compared to countries like France, Germany and UK,

357
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:11,173
more Muslims live in India.

358
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:13,910
But still, fewer IS*S recruits are seen in India.

359
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,562
If you look at the ratio here,

360
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:17,639
IS*S recruits per million people,

361
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,685
India has a ratio of 0.5 per million.

362
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:21,684
It is 36 times more in France,

363
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:23,115
at 18 per million.

364
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:24,866
Belgium has a ratio of 40 per million

365
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:27,249
and in Jordan, it is 315 per million.

366
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:29,676
Was this mentioned in the film even once?

367
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:31,241
Some people truly enjoy

368
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,602
watching a state of their country being defamed

369
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:35,266
based on lies.

370
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:36,963
The ORF report held that

371
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:39,379
academics and experts often ask

372
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,810
why did so few Muslims from India join IS*S?

373
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,964
There are many factors for this.

374
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:48,017
First, the superb response of the Indian agencies.

375
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:51,415
Very few of you may know about Operation Pigeon.

376
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:54,584
Our agencies like NIA and IB

377
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,875
carried out a mission

378
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,665
in which they identified 350 vulnerable Malayali youth

379
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,483
and ran a de-radicalization program

380
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:06,733
to save our youth from this extremism and radicalization.

381
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,681
A great job by our officers.

382
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,145
But you know what's shameful?

383
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:14,060
Our Prime Minister, in his election speeches

384
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,126
instead of promoting good work,

385
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:18,529
the PM promotes this film of lies.

386
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:22,189
"The film based on t3rr*rist plots

387
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,230
The Kerala Story is nowadays

388
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,093
is highly talked about."

389
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:29,884
This reminds me of another historic operation

390
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:32,405
by the Indian forces against IS*S.

391
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:34,277
An immensely risky operation

392
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:36,262
on which the film Tiger Zinda Hai was made.

393
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,003
If you want to know more about it,

394
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:43,026
I will suggest that you listen to this audiobook on KUKU FM.

395
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,228
In case you don't know, KUKU FM is a great audio-learning platform

396
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,509
where you will get to listen to many such audiobooks.

00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,940
You will find the link in the description below.

401
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,521
And I'm thankful to them for sponsoring this video.

402
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:02,293
And now let's get back to the topic.

403
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,197
If Prime Minister Modi wanted,

404
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,640
he could have told people about this inspirational story.

405
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,931
But no, he had to promote a propaganda film.

406
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,878
The second reason as claimed by former diplomat Talmiz Ahmad,

407
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:14,571
is India's syncretic culture and tradition.

408
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:16,839
The Unity in Diversity in India.

409
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,261
Muslims live harmoniously with Hindus and Christians in India.

410
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,924
And that's why they rejected extreme ideologies.

411
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:25,969
In 2015, when it was found that

412
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:28,295
only 29 Indians had joined IS*S,

413
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,521
a report stated that IS*S itself

414
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,801
considered Indian recruits to be inferior.

415
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:35,709
IS*S believed that the Islam practised in India

416
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,425
is a very soft version.

417
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:39,605
It is a liberal version of Islam.

418
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:43,222
Third, many Muslim clerics have also played a positive role here.

419
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:47,518
In March 2009, Darul Uloom Deoband issued a fatwa

420
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:50,301
declaring India as Dar al-Aman.

421
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,360
A country where militant Jihad is prohibited.

422
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,758
Similarly, in 2015, a joint fatwa was issued

423
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:59,661
by 70,000 Indian Muslim scholars

424
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:03,446
against IS*S, Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other t3rr*rist organizations.

425
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,748
The real Kerala story here

426
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:07,059
is something to be proud of.

427
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,111
Compared to the rest of the world

428
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,242
how few Muslims from India joined IS*S.

429
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:16,415
And Kerala is a living example of unity in diversity.

430
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:20,406
People of different religions live together peacefully.

431
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,692
This is the reason why Kerala is the number one state across many indicators.

432
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:25,258
Number one in education,

433
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:26,458
number one in healthcare,

434
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,718
number one in human development index.

435
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:33,228
But then our politicians use these fake stories to defame Kerala.

436
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,737
In February this year,

437
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:37,530
when Home Minister Amit Shah was campaigning for the elections

438
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,108
said in Karnataka that

439
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,739
Kerala is right next to Karnataka.

440
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,259
Heavily implying on how dangerous Kerala is.

441
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:45,972
Maligning Kerala is not the only propaganda in this film.

442
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:48,887
Another Big Lie is Love Jihad.

443
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:50,917
In the film, it is shown that

444
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:54,251
there are forceful religious conversions.

445
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,386
What is the truth?

446
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:57,538
In 2017, the Kerala government

447
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:00,964
submitted a list of 90 cases to the NIA

448
00:18:00,964 --> 00:18:04,367
to investigate whether there was a Love Jihad angle or not.

449
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,551
NIA examined 11 of those cases

450
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:09,051
and concluded in 2018

451
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:12,194
that although PFI facilitated conversion,

452
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,118
but not a single case was found

453
00:18:14,118 --> 00:18:19,918
where a person of whatever gender was being forced to convert.

454
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:22,395
If one proof is not enough, look at the other.

455
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:25,160
The Union Home Ministry said the same in 2020.

456
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,698
In 2020, Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy

457
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:30,075
told Lok Sabha in a written reply that

458
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,315
no case of Love Jihad has been reported

459
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:35,110
by any central agency.

460
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,283
This conspiracy theory of Love Jihad

461
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,721
is a Big Lie told to you

462
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,324
using different angles.

463
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:43,038
Politicians use it in their speeches

464
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,418
you get these WhatsApp forwards from WhatsApp University

465
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,304
talking about Love Jihad

466
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:50,523
And the propaganda news channels use Love Jihad as news.

467
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:53,312
This big lie is repeated so many times that

468
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:56,192
people begin to think that there must be some truth in it.

469
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:57,813
The same thing that I said in the beginning.

470
00:18:57,813 --> 00:18:59,546
The whole concept of Love Jihad

471
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:02,035
is not only used to defame Muslims,

472
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:04,359
but the concept goes against women.

473
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,695
Think about it,

474
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:07,904
people who believe that

475
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:11,391
a woman can be easily manipulated by a man,

476
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,609
what kind of people are they?

477
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,065
Are women cattle?

478
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:15,845
Doesn't a woman have a brain?

479
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:17,594
Anyone can come and say anything,

480
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:20,941
and women will meekly follow around like cattle.

481
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:22,923
Whether it's a Hindu woman, a Muslim woman,

482
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:25,369
a Christian woman, or a woman of any other religion.

483
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,375
All women should come together

484
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,083
to tell their religious leaders to mind their own businesses.

485
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,278
Women have brains.

486
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:33,169
If a man tries to forcefully convert a woman,

487
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,694
she can go to the police.

488
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:36,526
And the law states that

489
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:39,132
if someone tries to forcefully convert another person,

490
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:40,508
he will have to go to jail.

491
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:42,063
But the question is,

492
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:44,210
how many people are being converted in India?

493
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:47,238
Sometimes some Christian missionaries,

494
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:50,106
or these Hindu priests or Muslim clerics

495
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,699
become a little overactive in their preaching

496
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:54,804
and the balance shifts a bit.

497
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:56,778
Like this 2016 news article,

498
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,884
where the leader of Vishwa Hindu Parishad said that

499
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:03,714
their organization has converted 750,000 people

500
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:06,856
back to Hinduism in 10 years.

501
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:09,896
But if these religious leaders from different religions don't interfere,

502
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:12,344
and people want to convert of their own will,

503
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,437
then you get to see a balance.

504
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:16,272
Look at the April 2021 report.

505
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:19,498
506 people registered that they want to change their religion

506
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:20,870
with the Kerala government.

507
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,195
47% of these people

508
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:26,059
converted from Christianity or Islam to Hinduism.

509
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,054
So it's not like we are seeing more conversions to one religion.

510
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:31,413
2021 survey by the Pew Research Center

511
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:32,706
showed the same thing.

512
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,513
More than 30,000 people were surveyed

513
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:37,112
and it was found that only 0.7% of people

514
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,120
left Hinduism and adopted other religions.

515
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,026
And 0.8% of people left other religions and adopted Hinduism.

516
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:45,627
We need to understand that

517
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:48,007
merely for some political power,

518
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:50,187
a very dirty game is being played here.

519
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:51,850
Big lies are being propagated,

520
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,474
conspiracy theories are being developed

521
00:20:53,474 --> 00:20:55,501
so that Hindus, Muslims, and Christians

522
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:57,258
can be provoked into fighting each other.

523
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:59,819
Some political parties benefit a lot if

524
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:03,307
people are filled with hatred for people from other religions.

525
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:05,996
In the beginning, it was only WhatsApp forwards,

526
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:07,846
then the propaganda-enabling media started doing this.

527
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:11,550
And now, propaganda films are being made to mislead people.

528
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,339
100 years ago, this used to happen during Hitler's rule as well.

529
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,226
Many propaganda films were made.

530
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,178
Many such films

531
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:26,408
which distorted history of their own will,

532
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:28,743
defamed Jews and

533
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:31,067
glorified German Aryans.

534
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:34,091
Such big lies were propagated in those films.

535
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:37,400
They were repeated to convince people.

536
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,679
In the greed for power and money 

537
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,000
these people are trying to break the country from inside out.

538
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,992
They who spread so much vile hatred

539
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:45,371
should remember one thing,

540
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,505
it is possible that they be successful

541
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:50,367
in spreading fear, violence and hatred.

542
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:51,441
But they need to remember that

543
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:53,775
this country has gone through a lot.

544
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:56,525
Whenever any power tried to divide the country,

545
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,374
the people of the country came together and bounced back.

546
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:00,935
At last, I'd like to say that

547
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:02,713
If you want to watch a film on this topic,

548
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:06,357
watch this Swedish TV series on Netflix,
The Caliphate.

549
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:08,552
No one has been defamed in that film,

550
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:10,619
no lies or propaganda has been spread.

551
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:12,860
In fact, it tells a true story

552
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,465
of how IS*S recruited some young girls in Sweden.

553
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:19,006
It's a thrilling show.

554
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,120
And thank you very much!
