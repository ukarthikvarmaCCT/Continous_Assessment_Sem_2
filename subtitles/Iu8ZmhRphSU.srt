1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:03,101
- This person is fast,
but this person is faster.

2
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:04,755
This person might even be a robot.

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:05,999
- Sonic speed.

4
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:07,441
- We're going to react, once again,

5
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,160
to the fastest workers on the planet.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,458
- Because it got a lot of views.

7
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,291
Yay!

8
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,365
- So, this is the world's fastest cashier.

9
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,219
- That boy crazy.

10
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,000
(mumbles)

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,923
- Oh my gosh.

12
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:19,519
You're walking with your car to checkout

13
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,303
and you see that man and you go,

14
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:22,921
I'm just gonna take this
mountain dew and put it back.

15
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,754
- Yeah.

16
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:25,530
You get home and you got to open your soda

17
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,691
it's just blows up (mumbles)

18
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,005
- You cut open your
chicken and it explodes it.

19
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:31,599
And it's not even supposed to explode.

20
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,442
- That doesn't even make any sense.

21
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:34,632
- Those are propane tank.

22
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,168
- He's just hitting them.

23
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:38,077
- Those are propane tanks
and he's just throwing them.

24
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:39,354
- He's like flipping them.

25
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:41,055
That's so unsafe for no reason.

26
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:43,469
- Oh, so he's painting the
little thing on the cross walk.

27
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,663
- I always thought that was
like a thing they put on it

28
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:47,879
and then they spray paint
like a stint, so I guess.

29
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:48,712
- Wow.

30
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:50,190
This guy's about the
flink something in here.

31
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,054
- Oh, he's putting ice in it.

32
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:53,440
He nice with the ice.

33
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,273
- What is that for?

34
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:55,106
- In some places.

35
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:55,939
- Don't act like you know.

36
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:56,949
- In some places they don't have fridges.

37
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:58,054
They just produce ice.

38
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:59,720
So they have to transport ice.

39
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,585
- That's how they move it?

40
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:02,688
- And he throwing it in there,
because he nice with it.

41
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,634
He nice with the ice.

42
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:04,467
- Nice with the ice.

43
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:05,300
Oh, I've seen this clip.

44
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,136
This guy filmed the a hundred meter dash

45
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:09,259
and somehow ran faster than them.

46
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,092
- Look at him.

47
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:11,475
- He's doing it in like jeans too.

48
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:13,428
- That's one of those animated
moments where you were like,

49
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:15,409
wait a minute, you put
down the camera, you go.

50
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,297
- I could win.

51
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:17,661
But then who would film him?

52
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,494
Because he's.

53
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:19,327
(crosstalk)

54
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:20,687
To find somebody faster than him.

55
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:21,982
- Which might not be possible.

56
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,395
Maybe that's why he's doing that job.

57
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,228
- Yeah.

58
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:25,663
- What if that's how
Usain Bolt turned into

59
00:01:25,663 --> 00:01:26,726
just into camera man.

60
00:01:26,726 --> 00:01:27,696
- He is the next guy.

61
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:28,766
- For the a hundred meter dash.

62
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:30,360
So like, Usain Bolt, you're the guy.

63
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,267
So this is apparently the
world's fastest dealer.

64
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:33,492
(mouth mumbling)

65
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:34,584
I feel like I can do it fast.

66
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:36,031
- I think Chandler can do it faster.

67
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,057
Chandler is pretty fast.

68
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:37,940
(gasps)

69
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,773
I want this.

70
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:39,606
- Oh wait.

71
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:40,439
- But.

72
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,325
- If this video gets 1 million likes,

73
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:42,701
I'll buy him a pancake bot.

74
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:43,534
Please I want it.

75
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:46,277
I want to build Tucker
Tyrannosaurus Rex pancakes.

76
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:47,215
- That's pretty convincing.

77
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:49,155
All right, I'm upping it to 1.5 million.

78
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:49,988
- What?

79
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:51,326
If it's more convincing.

80
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:54,937
- If this turns out to be
do-do I'm going to be mad.

81
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:55,770
- Look at that.

82
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,603
That's beautiful.

83
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:57,440
- I need that in my life.

84
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,273
- I need that.

85
00:01:58,273 --> 00:01:59,261
- So he's just putting
some white scribbles.

86
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:00,943
I'm sure nothing's going to come up this.

87
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:01,776
- I don't really see what.

88
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:02,890
- Wait, is that Anderson Cooper?

89
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,723
- Yeah.

90
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,556
Anderson Cooper is on everything.

91
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:05,502
I don't.

92
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:07,919
- Is he going to throw paint?

93
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,243
- Oh!

94
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,388
That's so cool.

95
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:13,916
You don't see it unil it's upside down.

96
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,005
And now I see it.

97
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,196
- I thought he was going to
like throw a bucket of paint to.

98
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:18,029
(burps)

99
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:18,862
- I'll just shut up.

100
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:19,695
- You should.

101
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:20,528
- Is this how they load a plane?

102
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:21,361
- Yeah.

103
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:22,993
Except for, they're missing all
the parts where they slam it

104
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:24,082
into the ground and stop.

105
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:25,496
(laughing)

106
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:27,409
- And break everything
fragile in your bag.

107
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:28,248
- Fast car.

108
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,499
- Nothing beats watching them.

109
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:30,332
(makes car sounds)

110
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:31,508
Change to formula one.

111
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:32,469
- Gone.

112
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,302
Hey!

113
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:34,135
Archery girl.

114
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:34,968
It's Legolas.

115
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,788
- Watch those arrows just
not be hitting anything.

116
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:39,193
They're just flying out into the stands.

117
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,026
Oh, well.

118
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,048
- They're hitting a rug.

119
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:41,881
- Oh, nevermind.

120
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,714
I take it back.

121
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:43,547
You're actually pretty active.

122
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:44,380
Is that a duck?

123
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,213
- He's laying his duck.

124
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:46,046
Oh!

125
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:46,879
He gone.

126
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,712
- Oh.

127
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:48,545
Oh!

128
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:49,378
That boy gone.

129
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,211
- That duck was like

130
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,044
"Hey, I never loved you."

131
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:52,484
- That looks like a cartoon
thing where they're like.

132
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:53,317
(mouth running sounds)

133
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:54,150
- Yeah, like Bugs Bunny.

134
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,055
- Yeah, add some cartoon sound effect.

135
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,093
- Okay, this is Five Guys.

136
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,351
- I only see one girl though.

137
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,779
(drums plays)

138
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,443
- Just order from Beast Burger.

139
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:02,360
I didn't realize they made
the fries at the restaurant.

140
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,193
- They do.

141
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:04,726
And Five Guys fries are B tier.

142
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,559
- I agree.

143
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,428
A tier is Beast Burger and nothing else.

144
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:08,849
Oh, he's rolling pipes.

145
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,119
- Who knows what it's going for.

146
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:10,952
But he's doing it.

147
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,692
And he's got his hat backwards like I do.

148
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,625
- Oh my gosh.

149
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,570
- Yo, that guy's fast at climbing logs.

150
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,403
- Oh my gosh.

151
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:17,796
Yo, with the thing dangling behind.

152
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:18,629
- Looks like a monkey?

153
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:19,462
- Yeah.

154
00:03:19,462 --> 00:03:20,295
- Yeah.

155
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:21,128
Dude, we're in sync.

156
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:22,045
- Pancakes.

157
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,036
- I was thinking it.

158
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,684
My mouth just doesn't think
as fast as my brain does.

159
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:29,178
That's like 400 something pounds.

160
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:30,011
That's insane.

161
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,169
Is that how you want to be like?

162
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,002
- I don't want to be swollen.

163
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:32,835
I want to be a chad.

164
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:33,668
- That's chad.

165
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:34,654
- I've seen some chads that are smaller.

166
00:03:34,654 --> 00:03:35,824
He is a chad.

167
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,109
But you can be smaller
and still be a chad.

168
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:37,942
No.

169
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:41,233
Do you want to be a sigma, chad, daddy?

170
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,066
- No.

171
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,905
Do you want to be a beta, simp, cuck?

172
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:45,514
- I want to be in the middle.

173
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:46,722
- I can't do this anymore.

174
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:49,155
(laughing)

175
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:50,796
So that's how your.

176
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,424
That guy has muscles on his ribs.

177
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:53,257
What it like?

178
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:55,860
I don't even have, like
look, there's nothing there.

179
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,317
He has like an entire addition.

180
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,150
What is that?

181
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,166
- It's, he had an entire (mumbles)

182
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,332
where he just every single
rib just got muscle.

183
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:04,793
- Somebody broke that man.

184
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:05,626
Chad!

185
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:08,019
- This man was about to
propose and got heartbroken.

186
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:08,852
- Something.

187
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:11,433
He walked in and saw her
with another man or something

188
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,612
because he is a god.

189
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:13,762
- That is the sign.

190
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:16,455
Rib muscles is the sign
you got cheated on.

191
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:19,018
He just has a happy marriage,
been in love for 30 years.

192
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:20,550
We're just projecting on him.

193
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,493
- Sorry, bud.

194
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:22,326
- What's going on?

195
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:23,159
- Ball go fast.

196
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:23,992
Oh, that's satisfying.

197
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:25,830
This is how they did
Star Wars sound effects?

198
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,604
(light engine roaring)

199
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:30,687
- Yeah, this definitely has to be it.

200
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:33,201
There's no way any of that's accurate.

201
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,199
Look at the signing.

202
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,270
It just looks like scribbled.

203
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,103
I don't think

204
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:37,175
no, he's not signing.

205
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:38,008
He's just stamped.

206
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:38,951
Wait is he signing and stamping?

207
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,158
- He's signing and stamping.

208
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:42,540
(rock music)

209
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,790
(whispers)

210
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:50,368
There's just no way.

211
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,201
- Yo.

212
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:52,557
- Hey, that's Russian, bro.

213
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:53,390
Very slob.

214
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,858
I have a strong urge to
spend 10 years trying

215
00:04:55,858 --> 00:04:57,334
to master whatever he just did.

216
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:58,484
- All right, who you got money on?

217
00:04:58,484 --> 00:04:59,889
(crosstalk)

218
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:00,722
Oh, come on.

219
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:01,555
All right, fine.

220
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:02,388
I'll take green.

221
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:03,221
- I want green now.

222
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,054
- Okay, I'll take yellow.

223
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:04,887
A hundred dollars yellow.

224
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:05,720
Okay, 100 dollars green.

225
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,553
- Yellow.

226
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:07,386
- Green.

227
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:08,219
- Yellow.

228
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:09,052
- Wait.

229
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:09,885
- Yes!

230
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:10,718
Yellow!

231
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:11,551
Pum!

232
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,384
- Okay, well.

233
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:13,217
I will only include the 100 dollars

234
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:14,050
if this it's 1.5 million likes.

235
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,883
- Guys, go.

236
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:15,744
I need money.

237
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:16,577
- Wait, wait.

238
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:17,455
- Wait.

239
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:18,508
Fastest workers.

240
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:19,662
What's fast about that?

241
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:20,658
Oh.

242
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:21,569
- Oh!

243
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,343
- That cop is a fast worker.

244
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:24,855
- Yo, how do people stack cups like this?

245
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,616
I have a strong masculine
urge to try to master this

246
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:28,449
in a under a day.

247
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,127
Because it looks so
much easier than it is.

248
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,495
Although I know it's very hard.

249
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,577
- I have a strong
masculine urge to cut off

250
00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:35,160
from civilization and live
in the middle of nowhere.

251
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,393
And never talk to anyone.

252
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:38,162
- Literally nothing to do
with what I was talking about.

253
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,323
(cricket cricking)

254
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:42,556
Speaking of strong masculine
urges, they just lifted a car.

255
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:45,795
- They had the strong masculine
urge to take apart a vehicle

256
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:46,767
for no reason.

257
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,379
- Is this if your car gets stuck?

258
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,324
And that's how unstuck it?

259
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,157
- Yeah, wait.

260
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:52,519
So imagine you can't get
over something, right?

261
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,345
There's like something blocking the way.

262
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:55,784
You take your car apart.

263
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:58,773
Move it over the obstacle
and put it back together.

264
00:05:58,773 --> 00:05:59,606
- That's interesting.

265
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:01,787
Is that like a military thing or?

266
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:02,652
- It's gotta be, right?

267
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,992
- That looks like they fire department.

268
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:04,841
That's fire department.

269
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,193
- They're carrying
camouflage pants though.

270
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:07,839
Fire doesn't need to camouflage.

271
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,016
(crosstalk)

272
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:10,849
- What are you?

273
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:11,682
Dumb?

274
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:12,515
- What an idiot.

275
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:13,510
- It doesn't have eyes.

276
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,256
Me and the boys at 3:00 AM.

277
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:16,823
- I love concrete, man.

278
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:18,957
I love me some con queet, yeah.

279
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:20,839
- Some green guacamole and lettuce.

280
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,464
- [Man] Yes sir.

281
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:23,535
- Why this guy kind of sound like me.

282
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:24,368
- Dumb?

283
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:25,201
Just kidding.

284
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,145
- Okay.

285
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:26,978
All right.

286
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:27,874
Walter you got it.

287
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:28,807
You got it, Walter.

288
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:29,640
- Oh no.

289
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,473
Now we're stuck with Walter.

290
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,306
- Stuck?

291
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:33,145
Walter's a beautiful creature.

292
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:36,304
- All right, Walter, what is he painting?

293
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:37,137
Oh.

294
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,251
Okay, now some black paint.

295
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,501
Agreed, Walter?

296
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:45,463
Oh, snap!

297
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:47,137
Oh my gosh, that looks so good.

298
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:48,637
Is that a pyramid?

299
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:52,705
Yeah those are pyramids with
the Jupiter in the background.

300
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:54,202
- [Man 2] Are you talking to Walt?

301
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,336
- I'm talking to Walter, shut up.

302
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:56,922
So these are two professional climbers.

303
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:57,755
- All right.

304
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:58,648
Who's the faster climber?

305
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:01,571
Oh, guy on the right, killing it.

306
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:02,943
- Oh, leaning backwards like that,

307
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:04,599
would scare the mess out of me.

308
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:05,432
- Yeah.

309
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:06,373
How do you get used to doing that?

310
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:07,559
- Is this a marketing stunt?

311
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,585
Because if so it's working.

312
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,760
- Aren't these like ancient stairs?

313
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,964
Tell your phone to shut up.

314
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,521
- (Mumbles) Robert texted me.

315
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,467
- Oh, I get it.

316
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,300
You're Mr. Famous.

317
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,437
(crosstalk)

318
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,270
Oh my gosh.

319
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,103
Someone tell Tesla.

320
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:19,936
They should do that.

321
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:21,946
This is just literally
laying concrete on a wall

322
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:22,779
and it's beautiful.

323
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,093
But here's the thing, it was
covering up the exposed brick,

324
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:25,926
which I like.

325
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:27,458
I'm an interior design kind of guy.

326
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,591
- Yeah, you're a brick over concrete.

327
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,424
- Yeah.

328
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:31,954
My wife makes me watch a
lot of home design shows.

329
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:32,997
- Here, keep talking that way.

330
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:34,706
- Yeah, apparently exposed beams

331
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:36,213
and exposed bricks are very important.

332
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:37,046
Very interesting.

333
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:37,879
Why?

334
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,657
Well, because they say
it has a lot of the value

335
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:40,490
to the house.

336
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,771
Because it's more of a natural look.

337
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:43,604
Hey, melon.

338
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:44,548
I'm a big melon guy.

339
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,383
- That's zucchini.

340
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:46,216
- That is not.

341
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,049
- Just kidding.

342
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:47,882
- That's a cantaloupe.

343
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:48,715
Wait, that's a cantaloupe, not a melon.

344
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:49,548
- Oh!

345
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:51,597
- Wait, it's a cantaloupe
in the melon family?

346
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,430
- I don't know.

347
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,263
This guy is punching a ball.

348
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,205
- That's a weight ball too.

349
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:55,474
- That's how Goku trains.

350
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,788
- These all look like MPCs.

351
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:57,743
- They do.

352
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,705
I can't tell if he told them
what to do in the background.

353
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:00,538
- Yeah!

354
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:01,371
Yo, that kid's fast.

355
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,270
Oh my God.

356
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,329
Wait, he might become
a camera man one day.

357
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:06,542
- Wait, is this how they make brooms?

358
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:07,375
- You didn't know that.

359
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,302
- Don't act like you knew that.

360
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:09,731
- Bro, I used to work in a broom factory.

361
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:10,564
- No you didn't.

362
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:11,397
- Yeah, I had to quit though.

363
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:14,727
Because it just really swept me away.

364
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,318
- All right, with that one,
we're going to end the video.

365
00:08:16,318 --> 00:08:17,324
If you haven't already, subscribe.

366
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:18,157
Good bye.
