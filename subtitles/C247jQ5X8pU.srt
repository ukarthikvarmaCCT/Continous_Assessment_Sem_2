00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,173
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,173 --> 00:00:03,621
A child deprived of his father's love

3
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:07,127
either due to his father's absence

4
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:09,635
or excessively strict upbringing.

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:13,635
It leads to the child developing psychological issues

6
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:17,986
evolving into severe problems 
as the child reaches adulthood.

7
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:20,286
This isn't a fictional narrative;

8
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,903
numerous research papers have proved these claims.

9
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:25,760
Studies consistently indicate

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,178
that a father's absence 
diminishes a child's self-confidence.

11
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:30,863
Other studies show that harsh parenting,

12
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:33,870
excessive strictness while growing up, 

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,821
is linked to the development 
of aggressive behaviour in children.

14
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:39,739
You'd think that harsh parenting is very common, 

15
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,294
how can it be so bad?

16
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:43,582
I'd say, look around you.

17
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:48,673
Low self-confidence and 
aggression are common traits in people,

18
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,562
not only this, several research papers show that

19
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:53,653
the absence of a caring father

20
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,841
can be a contributing factor 
in someone becoming a criminal.

21
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:01,907
Imagine if someone were to 
make a film on such a sensitive topic,

22
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:03,334
well, you don't need to imagine it,

23
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:06,811
a cinematic masterpiece already exists

24
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,510
no, I'm not talking about the one you're thinking.

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,016
I meant 'The White Ribbon.'

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,577
The White Ribbon film was 
honoured with the Best Film Award

27
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:28,680
at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival,

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,012
as well as the International Critics Prize,

29
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:32,876
Best Film at the European Film Awards,

30
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,623
over 10 German Film Awards,

31
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:37,963
and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film.

32
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:41,601
India, too, boasts remarkable films on this sensitive topic,

33
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,193
such as Govind Nihalani's 'Ardh Satya,'

34
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:45,695
"I don't care about what you want."

35
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:47,681
"Am I your wife?"

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,434
"I live how I want to live,

37
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:51,290
I do not bow down to someone else's whims."

38
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,676
"You better not forget that."

39
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:56,010
Similarly, Vikramaditya Motwane's 'Udaan'

40
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:57,946
"If he wants to live in my house,

41
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:00,220
eat and wear what I earn,

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,650
he has to live like I want him to."

43
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,016
"But, I don't want to work in the factory."

44
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:05,149
"Did anyone ask your opinion?"

45
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,860
There are some beautifully 
written famous songs on this issue,

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,764
such as this.

47
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:10,225
The lyrics emphasise that

48
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,213
though people know how to have children

49
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:14,545
but they struggle with becoming a father.

50
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:18,016
Now, consider the scenario, this sensitive concept

51
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:20,139
is picked up by an insensitive director,

52
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,198
with a track record of regressive and 
misogynistic films, such as Kabir Singh,

53
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:26,106
what will happen then?

54
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:28,407
Unfortunately, we don't need to merely speculate,

55
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:31,236
be it would result in this film, Animal.

56
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,444
While Bollywood has produced 
its fair share of subpar films,

57
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:37,131
this particular one stands out.

58
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:39,779
To me, this seems like a cringe-fest

59
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:42,488
which will prove to be c@ncerous for our society.

60
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:44,846
Some may instantly dismiss this critique

61
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:46,688
as an exaggeration,

62
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:48,000
arguing that it's just a film

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,845
and there's no need to be overly 'woke'.

64
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:52,018
Additionally, comparisons are 
drawn to other violent films

65
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,306
like Gangs of Wasseypur, 
Kill Bill, and Pulp Fiction,

66
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:55,300
that are not criticised as much.

67
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,320
And that watching violence in films 
doesn't drive one to violent behaviour.

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,900
The director of a film brings their individual morality

69
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,758
and subjective opinions into the narrative.

70
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:06,971
Labelling a film as a 'cringefest c@ncer' may seem too harsh.

71
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,034
I merely ask you to hear me out.

72
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:11,562
I promise to delve into a detailed explanation in this video.

73
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:15,258
Not only about the problematic elements in the film,

74
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:17,951
but also the broader societal issues,

75
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:21,415
touching on topics such as alpha males and feminism.

76
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:31,729
Friends, I am sure you remember 
the Nirbhaya case from 2012.

77
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:34,490
That had shocked the entire nation.

78
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:40,733
During that time, Madhumita Pandey, 
a Clinical Psychology Master's student,

79
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,055
embarked on a quest

80
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:47,013
to understand the motivations behind such heinous acts.

81
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:49,675
To look for the answers to this,

82
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:53,182
she decided to talk to the individuals who committed such acts.

83
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:57,185
She wanted to survey the prisoners of Tihar jail.

84
00:03:57,185 --> 00:04:01,103
Eventually, she interviewed 122 convicted r*pists

85
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:03,872
and 65 convicted m*rd3rers in Tihar jail.

86
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:06,775
A stark difference emerged in their responses,

87
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:11,998
most m*rd3rers expressed some 
level of regret for their actions,

88
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:15,405
they regretted destroying multiple lives.

89
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:17,822
Some regretted their actions more than others,

90
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:22,219
but most of the m*rd3rers 
felt some degree of regret.

91
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:24,813
But when she talked to the convicted r*pists,

92
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:28,679
many exhibited a lack of regret,

93
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,423
they felt no remorse.

94
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,593
This was consistent with the documentary,

95
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:35,917
'India's Daughter,' which 
focused on the Nirbhaya case.

96
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,008
When interviewing the r*pists,

97
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:39,467
the assailant justified his actions

98
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:42,056
by questioning why the victim was 
out late at night with her boyfriend,

99
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,329
expressing a desire to 'teach her a lesson.'

100
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:46,238
Notably, it was clear throughout the interview

101
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:49,565
that he felt no ounce of regret for his actions.

102
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:51,807
Observing this pattern, 
Madhumita sought to understand

103
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,570
the underlying reasons behind 
the lack of regret among r*pists.

104
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,509
Why do they show no signs of remorse?

105
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:59,399
She gave them two questionnaires:

106
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,217
the MMIS 
Multicultural Masculinity Ideology Scale

107
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,536
and an Attitude Towards Women Test.

108
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:07,360
The results indicated that

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,839
these individuals held 
highly regressive views about women,

110
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,254
reflecting backward thinking.

111
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:16,008
Madhumita wasn't the only one to research this.

112
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:18,878
Many such research have 
been conducted outside India too,

113
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:21,645
such as Susan Brownmiller's 1975 book

114
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:23,908
'Against Our Will, Men, Women, and R*pe.'

115
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,532
emphasized the same points.

116
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,634
In her book, she wrote that r*pe

117
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:30,096
is a form of intimidation,

118
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,538
often driven by a desire to assert power

119
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:35,191
and dominance over women.

120
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:37,046
Other researchers, including Richard Johnson,

121
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,532
Danielle Cusmano, and Rebecca Whisnant,

122
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,587
came to the same conclusion.

123
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:43,143
R*pe is not driven by a

124
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,448
an unrestrained desire to fornicate.

125
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:48,010
Rather, there are three main motives driving r*pists:

126
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,449
a need to display their power,

127
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,624
an outlet for anger,

128
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:56,946
and sadistic cruelty.

129
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:59,045
However, a common thread among these motives

130
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:02,917
is the perpetrators' belief in the inferiority of women.

131
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,765
This prompts the question:

132
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,715
where does this regressive thinking originate?

133
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:10,275
The answer is: Everywhere.

134
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:12,510
There's a saying that holds true here.

135
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,402
'A man is the product of his environment'

136
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:19,366
It means that a person's 
behaviour, personality, and identity

137
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:22,144
are moulded by their surroundings.

138
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:23,809
These factors include everything,

139
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:27,021
the way their parents care for them,

140
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,853
their interactions with relatives,

141
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:35,107
experiences in school 
with teachers and friends,

142
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:38,437
and exposure to their surrounding environment.

143
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:41,060
Additionally, mass media plays a major role in this.

144
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,107
Things that are in the news, books, radio, TV ads,

145
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:53,307
social media content, songs, and movies,

146
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:59,310
significantly influences the formation 
of a person's identity and behaviour.

147
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,766
Some aspects of your life are within your conscious control,

148
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:04,644
such as what you choose to read or watch.

149
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:09,061
However, everything has a 
subconscious effect on your mind,

150
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,512
that you may not immediately recognize.

151
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:13,611
Some may argue against this by

152
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,206
pointing out that they watch gangster movies

153
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:18,140
without becoming gangsters themselves.

154
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,113
Sandeep Vanga Reddy, the director of this film,

155
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:22,369
made a similar argument in an interview

156
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:26,527
when Anupama Chopra asked him about 
the societal impact of films like Kabir Singh.

157
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:30,184
He compared it to watching gangster movies

158
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,362
without becoming a gangster consequently.

159
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,202
"I grew up watching Gyang Leader

160
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:37,288
Parinda, Ram Lakhan, Tezaab,

161
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:40,260
me and my brother never became 
gangsters after watching Parinda."

162
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,449
This is the same argument that some people use

163
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,673
when justifying eating deep-fried food,

164
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,590
that are known to increase 
the risk of a heart attack,

165
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,906
and increasing cholesterol levels,

166
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:51,596
using the argument that they are 
still alive and haven't suffered a heart attack. 

167
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,571
The point is, having one unhealthy 
meal may not cause a heart attack,

168
00:07:55,571 --> 00:08:00,303
but if you keep having deep-fried food 
for days and weeks and years,  

169
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:02,652
you may suffer a heart attack someday.

170
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:06,603
And you will always be at an 
increased risk of getting a heart attack.

171
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:10,137
Similarly, if someone says that they 
worked out in the gym for an hour

172
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:12,239
but haven't lost weight yet,

173
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:14,985
we need to remember that 
changes are made in small increments.

174
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:17,297
Each droplet adds up to create the ocean.

175
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,381
The same can be said about films.

176
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:22,523
Watching one gangster film doesn't make a person a gangster.

177
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:25,664
Nor does watching one good film make a person a great person.

178
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:28,948
But the small incremental changes that 
they have on the psyche of the viewers,

179
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:31,015
adds up throughout their lives.

180
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:32,967
Whether it is positive or negative.

181
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:36,001
In the weight loss video, 
I discussed the multiple factors

182
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:39,341
including diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management.

183
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:42,688
I pointed out that effective weight 
loss is a combination of all these factors.

184
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,155
Similarly, if everything goes well in a child's life,

185
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:48,068
he has parents who care for him,

186
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,166
teachers who treat him well,

187
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,667
good friends,

188
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,139
he reads good books,

189
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,472
he is educated, thinks logically, 

190
00:08:56,472 --> 00:08:58,505
and uses his intellect in every aspect of his life,

191
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,433
watching one problematic film wouldn't affect him.

192
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:04,833
However, consider the opposite scenario:

193
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,199
a boy named Munnu

194
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,520
growing up in a household with 
his father beating his mother,

195
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,389
restrictive rules for his sister 
that aren't applicable on him,

196
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,583
on YouTube, Munnu follows those 
YouTubers who objectify women.

197
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,081
Saying that women aren't capable of thought. 

198
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:21,998
And that their only role is to do household chores.

199
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:25,053
On Instagram, Munnu follows creators like Andrew Tate,

200
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:28,422
the symbol of toxic masculinity and misogyny.

201
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:30,350
He sees him saying the same stuff.

202
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,239
Moreover, when Munnu listens to songs,

203
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,593
he encounters the same 
objectification of women in the lyrics.

204
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:37,414
'I am a tandoori chicken, 

205
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:38,928
eat me with alcohol.'

206
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:40,303
Honey Singh's songs.

207
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:41,707
Have you ever paid attention to their lyrics?

208
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,285
'I am a womanizer.'

209
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:45,060
'Don't meet me alone.'

210
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,126
'I don't hold a girl with silicone.'

211
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:48,993
'I don't fall in love with a brown girl.'

212
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:49,953
'I am a lion.'

213
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:51,220
'I don't graze.'

214
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,243
'You know I am a hunter.'

215
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:55,203
'I will eat you whole.'

216
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:57,364
Even repeating these lyrics feels unsettling.

217
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:01,606
UNICEF has highlighted a report by 
American Psychological Association, 

218
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:06,017
on how such objectification in mass media

219
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:08,633
contributes to violence against women.

220
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:13,314
At home, Munnu is exposed to news channels,

221
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:16,057
he hears politicians expressing views that

222
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:17,967
boys are bound to make mistakes,

223
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,883
girls shouldn't wear 'revealing' clothes,

224
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:22,573
girls shouldn't be out at night,

225
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:27,680
Television ads also contribute to this 
narrative of women's objectification.

226
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,031
For instance, a perfume ad may depict a girl

227
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:32,094
hearing four boys taking a 'shot' each,

228
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,343
she gets scared by this,

229
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,595
only to reveal they were talking about perfume.

230
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:37,140
To make matters worse,

231
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,378
when Munnu goes to watch a film in theatres,

232
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:42,272
he watches films like 'Animal.'

233
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:45,809
In this movie, the protagonist 
twisted his wife's arm violently.

234
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,228
grabs her neck,

235
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:48,704
and pointing a gun at her.

236
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:50,846
Some argue that such actions are justified

237
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:52,646
because the wife slapped him.

238
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:54,384
This is the key issue!

239
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:59,936
Why should violence, regardless of 
the gender involved, be glorified? 

240
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:01,549
According to Sandeep Vanga,

241
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,728
love is not genuine unless you can hit your partner.

242
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:05,853
I'm not kidding.

243
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:09,075
Sandeep Vanga had said this 
without any sarcasm in an interview. 

244
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:11,031
"When you are deeply in love,

245
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:13,144
if you don't have the liberty of slapping each other,

246
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:14,894
then I don't see anything there."

247
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:17,030
In the film, the protagonist, Rannvijay,
commits numerous mass m*rd3rs,

248
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,936
yet his wife, Geetanjali, never even thinks to leave him.

249
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:22,435
However, when he has an extramarital affair,

250
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:25,751
she encourages him to k*ll the other woman.

251
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,958
*Are you crazy?*

252
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,147
*You need treatment.* 

253
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:30,747
Despite being portrayed as a father of a daughter,

254
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:34,045
he mocks the discomfort of menstruation.

255
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:36,938
He tells his wife that this is a man's world.

256
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:40,298
He tells his lover to lick his shoe 
to prove that she loves him.

257
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:43,393
The film portrays this character
as someone with daddy issues,

258
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:44,993
lacking his father's love.

259
00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:48,652
However, Ranvijay exhibits the same 
neglect towards his own children.

260
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:52,201
Such behaviours might have been somewhat justified,

261
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:55,550
had the film depicted him as mentally ill

262
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,148
and later undergoing a positive transformation.

263
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,429
But that was not to be.

264
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:02,081
There was no redemption at the end of the film.

265
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:07,431
Ranbir Kapoor's acting fails to 
convey any sense of mental illness,

266
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:12,110
causing the misogyny and 
toxic masculinity to be glorified.

267
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,862
The protagonist of the film

268
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:16,823
does all of this with the utmost confidence.

269
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:20,332
Almost like an alpha male.

270
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:25,735
Munnu's entire environment is 
steeped in regressive views,

271
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:29,286
pervasive objectification of women, 
and mistreatment of women.

272
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:31,785
Despite this, people say; 
how much damage can one film cause?

273
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,354
Though one film doesn't turn people bad,

274
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,758
it's part of the toxic environment that we are living in.

275
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:39,310
Such films ensure that the environment remains toxic.

276
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,799
That's why I say that movies like 'Animal'

277
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,244
are c@ncerous to our society.

278
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:46,351
This was evident on the film's poster.

279
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:50,685
Featuring the hero promoting cancer by smoking, 

280
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,461
what else could one expect?

281
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:53,970
On the same day 'Animal' was released,

282
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,935
another film hit the cinemas,

283
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,299
'Sam Bahadur,'

284
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,858
centred around Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw,

285
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:03,615
look at the stark contrast 
between the heroes of the two films.

286
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,118
Sam Bahadur, a real-life hero

287
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:09,641
who fought for the country and humanity.

288
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:13,043
He played a pivotal role in preventing 
a horrific genocide in Bangladesh.

289
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:17,493
Should people like Sam Bahadur be the symbols of masculinity?

290
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:20,422
Or characters like Kabir Singh and Rannvijay?

291
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:22,475
For those interested in learning more about his life,

292
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:25,524
there's an excellent audiobook with 12 episodes on KUKU FM.

293
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:27,999

Now, let's get back to the topic at hand.

301
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:47,539
Let's delve into the narrative of this film.

302
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:51,526
Years ago, Mario Puzo authored 
a novel titled 'The Godfather.'

303
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:54,277
Famous director Francis Ford Coppola

304
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:58,116
adapted this novel into a 
highly successful trilogy of films.

305
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:01,937
Since then, numerous Indian films have copied it,

306
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:04,113
such as Dharmatma, Nayakan, Dayawan,

307
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:06,169
Aatank Hi Aatank, Sarkar,

308
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:08,250
Malik, and now Animal,

309
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,118
The extent of originality or imitation in this film 
is something you can discern for yourself.

310
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,048
In 'The Godfather,' the plot 
revolves around a gangster named Vito,

311
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:16,873
who oversees a vast business empire.

312
00:14:16,873 --> 00:14:20,551
His younger son, Michael, resides abroad in America.

313
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:23,307
However, when an assassination attempt is made on Vito's life,

314
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:25,063
Michael returns and

315
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:26,528
joins the gang.

316
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:30,508
He discovers that the traitor was 
his sister's husband, Carlo,

317
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:31,909
so he gets Carlo k*lled.

318
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:35,061
And then he starts getting into conflicts with rival gangs.

319
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:37,480
'The Godfather' belongs to the gangster genre,

320
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,758
but Sandeep Vanga Reddy opted

321
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:42,639
to make a film that would make millions at the box office. 

322
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,859
So he copied the concept of his earlier film, Kabir Singh.

323
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:52,078
To have a protagonist who would be the anti-hero.

324
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,385
a short-tempered, quick-to-anger alpha male

325
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:58,986
who smokes excessively,

326
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:01,164
projecting an image of 'coolness.'

327
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:04,847
And since he knows that showing violence 
in the film would draw in more crowds,

328
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:07,179
he decided to heighten the violence,

329
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,664
emphasizing bloodshed.

330
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:12,524
During an interview with Anupama Chopra, Sandeep expressed

331
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:15,246
his intent to make his next film even more violent

332
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,409
than Kabir Singh,

333
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,962
aiming to push the boundaries of violence in cinema.

334
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:21,843
"It will be more,

335
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,964
because these guys are calling this a violent film,

336
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,094
I want to tell them,

337
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:27,008
I'll show them what a violent film will be."

338
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,614
Once Animal was released,

339
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:30,888
his fans enthusiastically share this clip

340
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,807
as a testament to Sandeep's knack for making violent films.

341
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,678
Interestingly, fans of such films often exhibit a unique characteristic

342
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,352
you would have noticed that

343
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:41,215
such films draw in the most number of toxic fans.

344
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:44,176
While Bollywood has seen its fair share of mediocre releases,

345
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,484
recent films like Tejas, Shehzada,

346
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:50,367
or Ranbir Kapoor's last film, Shamshera,

347
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,171
These films were negatively reviewed,

348
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:54,434
audience criticised them extensively,

349
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,025
but was anyone offended by this criticism?

350
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,499
No one was triggered.

351
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,175
However, when films like Kabir Singh and Animal are criticised,

352
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:03,432
some people find it hard to control their outrage.

353
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:06,568
Film critic Sucharita Tyagi, for instance, 
remarked that the film is not entertaining.

354
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:10,507
And the fans of this film resorted to abusing her on Twitter.

355
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:11,798
Why does this happen?

356
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:15,517
Because some individuals find validation in toxic films,

357
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,923
When these films receive criticism,

358
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:48,785
their fans feel that their own personality is being criticised,

359
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:52,045
and their validation is being taken away.

360
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,563
However, the underlying reason for 
the excessive bloodshed in such films

361
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:59,177
to be completely honest,
is that violence sells.

362
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,515
As Aamir Khan aptly noted,

363
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,867
as you can see in this clip,

364
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:06,769
"Directors who are not very talented creatively,

365
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,692
in creating a story,

366
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,951
in showing emotions, in creating situations,

367
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,425
they depend heavily on violence and s*x

368
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:15,576
to make their films work."

369
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,234
This isn't limited to Bollywood,

370
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:18,825
it is equally applicable to Hollywood.

371
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:21,722
This is a new genre of films

372
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:24,317
known as Slasher films or Gore films.

373
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:27,135
Imagine a conversation between two friends,

374
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:29,400
talking about a new Gore film.

375
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,654
Filled with violence and bloodshed,

376
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:32,952
and they plan to watch it

377
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,287
because it will be fun!

378
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,307
It will be fun to watch some broken skulls,

379
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,575
someone getting stabbed,

380
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:40,598
it would enliven their evening. 

381
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:43,510
Friends, there is a psychological reason why

382
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,738
some people love watching extreme 
violence and bloodshed on screen.

383
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:51,048
Typically, in their lives, these individuals

384
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:53,625
feel powerless and repressed.

385
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,247
Oppressed by someone else.

386
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:58,749
Those suppressed by authority figures, 
whether it's a boss,

387
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:03,759
a policeman, or even parents at home,

388
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,196
people like these are drawn to such gory and violent films.

389
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:12,302
In the theatre, they can envision 
themselves as the protagonist,

390
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:15,702
finding satisfaction in the violent that 
is directed towards someone else.

391
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:21,192
In 'Animal,' this violence and 
bloodlust is taken to an extreme level.

392
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:23,910
The protagonist doesn't just sh**t the enemy;

393
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,567
he goes on to str*ngle someone with his bare hands

394
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,863
or slice another person's throat with a knife.

395
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:34,755
Such characters, if encountered in real life, 
would be labelled as psychopaths.

396
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:37,713
The directors glamorize these scenes,

397
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:39,954
presenting them in a stylish manner,

398
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:46,426
resulting in a 15-minute-long continuous sequence showcasing bloodshed.

399
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:49,199
Someone aptly tweeted about this film.

400
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:53,986
This film is 'for the animals, 
of the animals, and by the animals.'

401
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:57,627
Ordinarily, a person would look at such characters

402
00:18:57,627 --> 00:19:00,791
and understand that they are 
psychologically troubled or mentally ill.

403
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:04,277
However, when this character seeks help 
from a psychotherapist in the film,

404
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,681
this point is dismissed.

405
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:09,686
No need to waste the audience's time with such seriousness,

406
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:12,465
there needs to be continuous scenes depicting bloodshed.

407
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,209
As Aamir Khan pointed out,

408
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:17,183
cheap directors have nothing else to show,

409
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:20,886
so they keep showing these scenes 
to make as much money as possible. 

410
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:22,373
Because the truth is,

411
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:24,729
films can portray violence

412
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:27,065
without glamorizing it,

413
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,029
instead of showing it in a stylish way,

414
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:32,894
presenting a realistic depiction

415
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:35,577
that highlights the negative impact on society.

416
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:39,340
However, such realistic films 
often struggle at the box office.

417
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,060
Some great examples are Anurag Kashyap's works,

418
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,084
like Ugly, That Girl in Yellow Boots,

419
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,632
and Almost Pyaar with DJ Mohabbat,

420
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:49,839
these films offer a social commentary

421
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,009
but people don't want to watch 
violence being inflicted by the villain.

422
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:56,391
They find it disturbing and repulsive.

423
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:59,038
There are so many problems in the world already,

424
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,777
so why should they watch more violence in cinema halls?

425
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:06,498
Because the villain inflicting violence fills you with disgust.

426
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,822
You are repelled by that violence,

427
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:10,733
you hate watching every moment of such scenes.

428
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,427
While this aversion to violence is commendable,

429
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:14,270
no one should be drawn to violence,

430
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,255
but the audience's repressed self seeks entertainment,

431
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:20,530
craving violence from the hero's standpoint.

432
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,533
You want to imagine yourself as James Bond, or Kill Bill,

433
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,070
or this character from Animal.

434
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,261
Directors and producers understand this,

435
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,631
they capitalize on this demand,

436
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,329
flooding the market with violent action films.

437
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:37,180
Consequently, almost all of the recent big-budget films

438
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,851
heavily feature action and violence.

439
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:43,334
In a review of the film 'Animal,' a critic remarked.

440
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,078
we have moved passed family-oriented films like 'Hum Sath Sath Hai',

441
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,265
the audience now craves 'Animal'.

442
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:49,690
This is disheartening because 'Hum Sath Sath Hai'

443
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,164
is a heartwarming family drama inspired by the Ramayana.

444
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:56,513
It is a film suitable for the entire family,

445
00:20:56,513 --> 00:21:01,418
delivering positive messages to society and 
reaching the heart in a way that fosters unity.

446
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:05,026
In the Ramayana video, I discussed the virtues of Lord Ram,

447
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,043
highlighting qualities like humility, compassion,

448
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:09,051
despite being fit and strong.

449
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:13,545
Such a man should be the ideal model 
of masculinity for our society.

450
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:15,695
However, some individuals reject such models

451
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:18,655
because they lack compassion and empathy themselves.

452
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:21,844
A human with no companssion,

453
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:24,574
is an animal, not a human.

454
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,905
Literally, an animal.

455
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:30,008
Characters like Kabir Singh and Rannvijay 
in Sandeep Vanga's film

456
00:21:30,008 --> 00:21:32,333
exemplify a lack of self-control,

457
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,266
Kabir Singh indulges in drinking and consuming drugs,

458
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:38,144
while Rannvijay resorts to shouting, beating,

459
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:41,077
and even threatening his wife with a gun when angered.

460
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:44,799
Can such characters truly serve as role models?

461
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,298
Those who appreciate such regressive characters

462
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:50,017
used to call themselves 'Macho Man' until recently.

463
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:55,468
However, in the past few years, a new term 
has popped up on social media for such people.

464
00:21:55,468 --> 00:21:56,379
'Alpha Male'

465
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:58,761
They call themselves Alpha Male.

466
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:01,990
If you are sensible, you will stay away 
from such a destructive way of thinking. 

467
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,811
Stop watching such films.

468
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:05,771
Our minds are not dustbins;

469
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:07,991
we should respect our minds.

470
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:11,246
If you have friends who enjoy such films,

471
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,328
consider sharing this video with them to illustrate

472
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:17,258
how these films are like a c@ncer to our society.

473
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:18,453
If you found this video insightful,

474
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:20,510
you can click here to watch the Ramayan video,

475
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,977
you'd like that too.

476
00:22:21,977 --> 00:22:23,617
Thank you very much!
