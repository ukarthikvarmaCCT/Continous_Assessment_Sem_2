1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,340
- [Jimmy] As you guys know,
I like to give away money,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,650
but in this video, we're gonna
do it a little different.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,300
I'm gonna give people a choice.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,060
Would you rather have
this $10,000 in cash,

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,053
or this key that goes
to something expensive?

6
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,990
(key slamming)
You have 10 seconds to decide.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,477
- 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five-

8
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:17,310
(Javier groaning)

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,357
- Which is it?
(timer ticking)

10
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:19,397
Ten grand, or-
- Four, three, two-

11
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:20,730
- The key, the key, the key,
the key, the key, the key.

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,778
- Okay.

13
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:23,610
(team clapping)
- Yeah. We hate money! Woo!

14
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,590
- You just turned down $10,000.

15
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,120
You don't know what this
key goes to. (laughing)

16
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,950
- Okay. I'm not really sure
if I should have took the key,

17
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,770
but my gut feeling says
like, you gotta take the key.

18
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,240
So I gotta go with my
gut. Gotta go with my gut.

19
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,728
(team chanting)
- Guts. Guts. Guts. Guts!

20
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:35,889
(Javier laughing)

21
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:37,950
(team chanting)
- Key. Key. Key. Key.

22
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,210
- All right. So.
(upbeat music playing)

23
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,800
Right around this corner over here,

24
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,600
you'll see what this key goes to.

25
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,433
- Okay.

26
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:44,310
- Cover his eyes.
- Hold on, hold on.

27
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,870
- All right. Face that way.

28
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,950
- Javier.

29
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,761
Take your hat off.

30
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:50,186
(team clapping)
- No way!

31
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:51,331
- You just-
- No way!

32
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,340
- A brand new car!

33
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,420
Guess how much it's worth.

34
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,380
- More than 10 grand?

35
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,450
- It's worth $26,000.
(cash register dinging)

36
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,822
- Woo!
(team cheering)

37
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:01,005
- Let's go.
- You wanna get a shot?

38
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:01,838
- Yeah.

39
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:04,210
(team chanting)
- Javier. Javier.

40
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,700
- Where you wanna go, boys?

41
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,533
- Hey, guess what?

42
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,830
You win something else.
- What is it?

43
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,300
- I'll give you your wallet back.

44
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,133
- My wallet?

45
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,550
- Javier, you took the risk.

46
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,470
You got the W, what do you wanna say?

47
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,050
- Listen to your gut.
I had a good feeling.

48
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,950
- Gut gang.

49
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,290
- Congratulations on your $26,000 car.

50
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,240
Throughout this video, we're
giving away many more cars

51
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,590
and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

52
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,700
This is just the beginning.

53
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,533
Next scene.

54
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:26,520
This next giveaway is two diamonds.

55
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,190
One of these diamonds is worth $25.

56
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,650
And one of these diamonds is worth 6,000.

57
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,870
Go ahead. You can touch
'em, do whatever you want.

58
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,020
One is worth $6,000, and
one is worth only 25.

59
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,620
- Okay. I have no clue, but
because I'm standing right here,

60
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,610
I'm gonna pick this one.

61
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,720
- I'm stressed.

62
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,900
So can you tell any difference
between the two diamonds?

63
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,180
- This one looks faker.
- What does that mean?

64
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,580
- It looks plastic. My
hands are like this.

65
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,560
- Why is this hand twitching
so much more than that?

66
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,060
- Because I feel like-
- That one's heavier.

67
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,590
That means that's the diamond.

68
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,423
- It's this one.

69
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:57,900
- So your choice is this diamond.

70
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,200
- It's my diamond.
- Yes.

71
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,530
- Oh gosh.

72
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,430
It's the fake one.
(box clicking)

73
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,450
- No way.
(buzzer sounding)

74
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,880
- The most important thing you
got out of this, friendship.

75
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,651
- Until you leave, then it's over.

76
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:08,484
(contestant laughing)

77
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:10,380
- For our next giveaway,
I want you to flip this.

78
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,380
This side says $0 and this
side says a thousand dollars.

79
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,670
Give it a flip.
- Woo!

80
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,838
- We want-
- Yeah, big money!

81
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:17,250
(team cheering)
(cash register dinging)

82
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,083
- Okay, hold up.

83
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:18,975
Now you can keep that thousand dollars,

84
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:21,480
or you can risk it to flip this.

85
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,483
This side is $0, and this side is $10,000.

86
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:25,320
(participant clapping)

87
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,153
- For sure.

88
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:27,785
- I want it at least above your head.

89
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:28,623
- All right.

90
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:30,415
- All right. And...
(cardboard clattering)

91
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:32,843
(team cheering)
(cash register dinging)

92
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:34,650
- Wait. What?
- Stay right here.

93
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,930
Do not move. Taylor, don't let him move.

94
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,120
- Dude. What was going
through your mind? $10,000.

95
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,990
- I didn't wait this whole time

96
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,823
for a thousand dollars.
(Taylor clapping)

97
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:41,656
- That's what I'm talking bout!

98
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:42,489
- I'm going big, or I'm going home!

99
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:45,480
- Once in a life time opportunity here!

100
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,313
- All right!
- Oh.

101
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:50,310
- You can risk your $10,000
for a chance at $20,000.

102
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,611
But this side still says zero.

103
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:55,002
(team chanting)
- Do it, do it, do it.

104
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,327
(Jimmy clapping)
- I am.

105
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:58,780
(cardboard clattering)
(team cheering)

106
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,530
- He did it!
- $20,000.

107
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,490
I'll be right back.
(team laughing)

108
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,963
- I don't know, man.

109
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:05,490
I don't know if I wanna keep going.

110
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,517
- There's no way he goes for this.

111
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:07,350
- [Person Offscreen] No way.

112
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,940
- [Jimmy] I think you're
crazy if you do this,

113
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,880
but $40,000 or zero.

114
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,340
- I'm gonna call my girlfriend
and I'm gonna FaceTime her.

115
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,173
- Babe.
- Hey babe.

116
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:18,634
- Your man just won $20,000. No joke.

117
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:19,467
- No!

118
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,270
- If it lands on this side, it's $0,

119
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,340
it lands on this side, it's 40,000,

120
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,020
or he could just walk away with 20 grand.

121
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,970
- Babe, 20 grand's a lot...
- I don't know, man.

122
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm gonna be honest.

123
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,983
I came here to win.
- Ooh.

124
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:32,010
- And I felt I've done that.
(disappointed audience track)

125
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,067
- Oh yeah. I thought he was gonna say,

126
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:34,680
"I came here to win, so let's do it."

127
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,910
- I'm gonna settle for the 20.
(cash register dinging)

128
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,980
- I am curious if you would have won.

129
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,246
- Man, don't do that to me.
(upbeat music playing)

130
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:40,082
- Come on.
- You gotta see.

131
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:41,370
(Jimmy clapping)
- Come on.

132
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,274
- Are we listening to Taylor?
(cardboard clattering)

133
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:45,120
(team cheering)
(buzzer sounding)

134
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,953
- Listen to me.

135
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:47,730
- Our next bit is gonna
be an interesting one.

136
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,040
So this is Anna and as high as she counts,

137
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,140
I'll give her money. So just count to ten.

138
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,140
- One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

139
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,270
- So no joke. You can
count as high as you want.

140
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,890
And every single number you count,

141
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,660
I will give you a dollar at the end of it.

142
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,493
- Okay.

143
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:05,940
- The only stipulation
is, if you skip a number,

144
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,930
you go back to zero.

145
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,610
- Okay.
- Go ahead and start.

146
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,580
- One, two, three, four, five-

147
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,900
- Have fun counting.
- 87, 88.

148
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,340
- Steele, do not let her skip a number.

149
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,340
- 91 92 93- 104, 105,
113, 114, 128, 129, 130-

150
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:22,269
- [Jimmy] 140, 143, 144, 145,

151
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,960
- 131
- Works every time.

152
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,860
- Start over.
(Anna screaming)

153
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,360
- Next up is Juliana.

154
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,120
You can take $2,000 in cash,

155
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,415
or shoot a free throw for $10,000.

156
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:33,248
- Make.

157
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:35,610
- Make a free throw for $10,000.
It should go in the hoop.

158
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,900
- I'm gonna shoot a basketball.

159
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,270
- Wait really?
- She's puttin' her hair up!

160
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,664
(Taylor clapping)
- Okay.

161
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:40,982
- Okay.
- Okay.

162
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:42,030
I'm a little nervous. This is $10,000.

163
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,010
- Shh. I'm thinking.

164
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,150
- Okay.
(team conversing)

165
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,530
Chandler, stop talking.
(ball bouncing)

166
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,577
- Come on. Here we go. First time-

167
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:49,410
(electronic chord playing)
- Woo!

168
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,728
(team cheering)
(Juliana screaming)

169
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:51,561
- Yay! Yeah!
(team cheering)

170
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:52,830
(palms slapping)

171
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,110
- She stepped it up. She
knew what she had to do.

172
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,403
- I told you, I played before.

173
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,860
- Here you go. Plop that cash in here.

174
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,290
This is now your briefcase full of money.

175
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,123
Guys, is this for real?

176
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:03,570
- Congratulations on your money.

177
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,220
Chandler, let's do something fun.

178
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,860
Do you wanna bet $10,000 that you make it?

179
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,350
If you make this free throw,
I'll give you 10 grand.

180
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,970
But if you miss, you give me 10 grand,

181
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,177
which I'll donate to charity.
You don't have to do it.

182
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:16,504
- I want to, but I'm very
nervous that I'm gonna miss.

183
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:17,504
(Juliana laughing)

184
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:19,110
(ball bouncing)

185
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,113
- It's just a car. Rent for a year.

186
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:24,744
(Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling)

187
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:27,330
(buzzer sounding)
(team exclaiming)

188
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,310
Wow, I love how he almost
threw the ball at Chris,

189
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,947
like Chris did something.

190
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:31,780
(team exclaiming in slow motion)

191
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,600
(ball bouncing)
(Jimmy laughing)

192
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,433
- This ain't fair.

193
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,450
I got this new ring on
and it messed me up.

194
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,560
- Why don't you go hug him.

195
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
- Ryan, we need huggies.

196
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,350
- None of y'all are my friends.

197
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,520
None of y'all talked me out of it.

198
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,656
- I wanted to, but I'm so
confident in your skills.

199
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:46,020
- It's gonna be okay.
- Just think about charity.

200
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,270
I've always wondered if
I dropped tons of money,

201
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,820
how much could you catch? Let's find out.

202
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,650
And...
(crane whining)

203
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,640
Right here.

204
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,480
Okay.

205
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,280
We have Tim down there in the circle,

206
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,570
and we have tons of money.

207
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,830
Let's do a little sprinkle.

208
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,820
Sprinkage.

209
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,140
All right, Chandler, join us.

210
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,792
Whatever you catch, you
can keep, by the way.

211
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,660
(Tim grunting)

212
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,431
Oh, does this feel
condescending to anyone else?

213
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,943
(Chandler cheering)
What if we throw it at him?

214
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:10,560
- Hey!
- Hey, I'm ready.

215
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,857
- Let's go, boys.
(cash fluttering)

216
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:13,690
(team laughing)

217
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,270
Chandler, hit it off the ceiling.

218
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:17,424
(team laughing)

219
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:18,257
- No!

220
00:06:18,257 --> 00:06:20,880
- The money is literally
stuck in the ceiling.

221
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,807
- Yo, we gotta get it down.

222
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:24,360
- Are you guys curious? What
the girls counting are up to?

223
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,193
- Yeah, actually.

224
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:29,730
- 6784, 6785, 6786.

225
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,410
- Wow. I can't believe they're that high.

226
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,630
We're high as well.
- We should go down.

227
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,150
- Just get us to a point where
if we fell, we wouldn't die.

228
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,927
How much money did you catch?

229
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:40,551
- $1,929.

230
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,430
(cash register dinging)
- And according to Google,

231
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,672
that's when the Great
Depression hit. Yeah!

232
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:44,550
- Woo!
(palms slapping)

233
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,600
- Up next is Noah.

234
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,530
Now I want you to pick,
hat, shirt, or umbrella.

235
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,540
- Hat.

236
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,373
- He was very confident in that.

237
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:50,206
(team cheering)
(Chandler clapping)

238
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:51,039
- Let's go!

239
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,773
- Okay. And now we go up again.

240
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,050
Are you ready?

241
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,100
We ready for what?

242
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,800
- There's $8,071 in this box.

243
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,480
Whatever you catch, you can keep.

244
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,190
I'm literally about to
dump a ton of money.

245
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,078
It would've been 10 grand,
but the other guy took,

246
00:07:04,078 --> 00:07:05,443
it was like-
- 1929.

247
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:06,600
- Oh yeah. The Great Depression.

248
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,718
Here we go.
- Ready...

249
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:09,551
(cash thudding)

250
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:11,760
- Oh!
- Oh, oh no.

251
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,560
- Oh, you're dropping it.

252
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,670
- I'm holding too hard.

253
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,503
- Okay.

254
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:16,336
We're dropping more.

255
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,120
- What?
- Just scurry away.

256
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,270
- Oh, god...
- Scurry.

257
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:21,960
- [Person Offscreen] What are you gonna do

258
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,880
with this money, man?

259
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,610
- I'm gonna see if he'll let
me buy his Tesla with it.

260
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,230
- Ain't no rainy days here.

261
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,640
- You really couldn't have told me

262
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,070
I was not making a good
choice when I chose the hat?

263
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,650
- You chose the hat so
quickly. I didn't even-

264
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,483
- Oh my God.

265
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:36,316
- Are you counting?

266
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:39,120
- Somehow Noah caught $1,920,
(cash register dinging)

267
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,550
exactly $9 less than the other guy.

268
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,110
- Now I do need to ask you though,

269
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,070
would you be willing to
take $1,900 for your Tesla?

270
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,320
- How about if you beat
a different challenge?

271
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,014
I might consider it.
- Okay.

272
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:51,847
- So gimme a second.

273
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,820
- I don't, I didn't know that
I could just challenge Jimmy

274
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,898
for his Tesla.
(palms clapping)

275
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:55,830
(both laughing)

276
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,170
There's no way I'll win
to Tesla here. Right?

277
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,600
- I have 10 cups and I'm
gonna grab a cheese ball.

278
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,220
If he guesses the cup with a cheese ball,

279
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,840
he can have a Tesla.

280
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,250
In this ZHC video, ZHC gave
me a customized MrBeast Tesla.

281
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,180
But at the end of the video,

282
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,768
I had Chris and Chandler play
rock paper scissors for it.

283
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:12,810
- I won.
- And Chris won.

284
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,000
Chandler. You sad about that?

285
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,460
If he wins, can I just
buy you a new Tesla?

286
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,540
- Yeah, I guess so.

287
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,373
- Perfect.
(Jimmy clapping)

288
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,206
Noah, come on over.

289
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:21,540
There's 10 cups here.

290
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,580
One has a cheese ball
under it. If you pick it,

291
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,346
I will give you Chris's Tesla.

292
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:26,179
(Noah sighing)

293
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:27,704
All right, fine. It's not this one.

294
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:28,537
There.
- Okay.

295
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:29,370
(Jimmy thumping table)
- Now you have

296
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,203
a one in nine chance.

297
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:31,470
I'm not doing that again.
I'm gonna go over here.

298
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,120
- By the way. If you win it,
you have to clean it out.

299
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,620
There's a lot of trash in the back.

300
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,820
- You gonna pick?
- Oh.

301
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,813
(electronic chord playing)
- Oh!

302
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:40,553
- (laughing) Wait!
- No way!

303
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,480
(Noah cheering)
- Did he actually get it?

304
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,120
- I've given away my car, I guess!

305
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,600
- So I really randomly won?

306
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,640
- There is only one.
(cups clattering)

307
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,136
- Oh my God.
- How did you do that?

308
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,340
- That's crazy!
(Chris laughing)

309
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,560
- On the bright side, you get $1,900.

310
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,763
- Oh no. You get to keep your $1,900.

311
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:55,293
- I get to keep the money too?

312
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:56,460
- Yeah, you can keep it.

313
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,293
(Noah and Jimmy laughing)
(Noah clapping)

314
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:58,126
- One in nine?
- Got the Tesla for you.

315
00:08:58,126 --> 00:08:59,703
- And it comes with all his clothes.

316
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,520
I cannot believe I just won a Tesla.

317
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,630
- You wanna get in your new car?

318
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,520
- Oh, absolutely.

319
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,910
- Hey Chris, do you mind
unlocking it for him?

320
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,080
- Oh, it's unlocked already.

321
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,540
- Oh my God. Let's go!

322
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,750
A Tesla's my dream car, too.

323
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,583
- Same.

324
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,230
- Now, your friend
literally only got $1,900,

325
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,390
and you walked away with a $50,000 car.

326
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,790
- He's the reason I was
invited here today, too.

327
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,813
So thank you, Tim.

328
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,483
- I'm sorry.

329
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:25,380
- I kind of want my new Tesla to be black.

330
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,400
- Huddle up. Huddle up. Huddle up.

331
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,160
Okay. Now that Chris
no longer owns a Tesla,

332
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,450
Let's go back to filming.

333
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,220
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

334
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,830
- For this next bit, we're
giving away another car.

335
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,663
This is Cameron.

336
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,020
He was in this video.
(video popping)

337
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,853
But you're back,
(Jimmy clapping)

338
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:39,570
and you can win money this time.

339
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,403
- Woo.

340
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:43,203
- Listen to this sound.
(engine revving)

341
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,636
Sounds like a car. And
listen to sound number two.

342
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:50,790
(engine revving)

343
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,640
Also sounds like a car,
but here's the thing.

344
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,070
Only one of those sounds is an actual car,

345
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,000
and the other is fake.

346
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,250
If you guess which one's
real, you get a car.

347
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,213
- One more time.

348
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:01,920
(engine revving)

349
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,020
- Ooh. You can hear that shifting in that.

350
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,336
Sounds like a fart first.
(all laughing)

351
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,169
I don't know,

352
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:10,500
I really like the shifting
that I can hear from this one.

353
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,540
So I'm gonna go with number one for sure.

354
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,150
- I'm going to show you where
we got audio clip number one.

355
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,990
- Okay.
- Karl, come here.

356
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,730
- Okay.
- All right.

357
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,460
So I want you to show them.

358
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,930
I hate stuff like this.

359
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,693
- That was, oh my gosh.

360
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,423
No way.

361
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:27,630
- This is what you picked.

362
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,590
This right here.
(Cameron laughing)

363
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,790
I'm gonna show you what
you could have got.

364
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,660
- Oh no.

365
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,114
- This is what you could have had.

366
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:33,817
- Wow.
- Oh come on, jump up in that.

367
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:34,650
(all laughing)

368
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,483
- Karl!

369
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:36,660
You guys might be able to tell by now,

370
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,820
I don't handle people losing well.

371
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,653
Take over Karl.
(Karl laughing)

372
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:41,639
- Oh no. Look your car's coming.

373
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,350
- No!
- Drive by!

374
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,782
- [Cameron] No, I don't like that car.

375
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:45,615
(trombone buzzing)

376
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:46,448
- Bye Cameron. Good luck.
- No.

377
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,963
- Good luck with your trumpet.
- We got more to film.

378
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,430
- You know what they say?
Third times the charm.

379
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,370
I'm giving you a chance to
remake the $10,000 you lost,

380
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,270
again again,

381
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,790
and before he shoots this
free throw for $5,000,

382
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,470
let's go check on the girls counting.

383
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,480
They're probably close to $10,000.

384
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,664
- 9177.
- Wow.

385
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,240
- 9178.

386
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,246
- All right. So you're
getting close to 10,000.

387
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:10,740
(Anna cheering)
- Wow.

388
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,573
- Sheets of-

389
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:13,260
- I know, it looks like
someone's having a manic episode.

390
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,093
- Wait. What was I? 91-

391
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:16,770
- 43, 82, 71-
- 94-

392
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,403
- Six, three, eight, 99,504.
(girls chanting numbers)

393
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:23,730
- Hey Chandler. So they're at
a really, really high number.

394
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,470
Honestly. I'm kind of
surprised, but anyways,

395
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,550
you wanna shoot this free throw?

396
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,383
- Yeah.

397
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,364
(upbeat music playing)

398
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:30,257
(bell dinging)
Yes!

399
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,570
(cash register dinging)
Yes!

400
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,640
- Okay.
- Yes!

401
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
- If you make this three
pointer, you get $10,000.

402
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,667
(ball bouncing)

403
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,408
(bell dinging)

404
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,140
(all cheering)
- Yes, yes! Yes, yes.

405
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,640
- You have now won 10 grand,

406
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,470
which makes up for the
10 grand you lost here.

407
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,303
Play the clip.

408
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:50,220
- Oh.
- Yes, yes.

409
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,993
- No, the clip of him losing 10 grand.

410
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:53,028
(Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling)

411
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:53,990
- Oh!
(all exclaiming)

412
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,510
Do you wanna risk your $10,000 for 20,000?

413
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,800
I know you do. Come on.

414
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,177
- [Chris] Yeah. Hoo! Hoo!

415
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,933
Hold up. We're grabbing a car.

416
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:08,352
(trombone buzzing)

417
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,253
Thank you.

418
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:12,949
(basket rattling)
(bell dinging)

419
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:13,837
(all cheering)
- Let's go!

420
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:15,060
(Chandler clapping)

421
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,893
- He made it.

422
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,702
- Gimme this thing.

423
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:20,100
- (Jimmy) Let me take this.

424
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,150
You just won $20,000,
(Chandler clapping)

425
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,646
which technically is 10,000,

426
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:26,796
'cause you owe me 10,000.

427
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,050
Ball me.

428
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,520
That's a trombone.
(trombone clattering)

429
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,680
If you stand behind this line,
which is really far away,

430
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,060
show the viewers.

431
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,979
- It's almost-
- 50 grand.

432
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:34,812
(ball bouncing)

433
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,810
- You think I can make this?

434
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,980
- No. (claps)
- Honestly.

435
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,390
Everyone's really quiet.

436
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,770
- Go broke or go home.

437
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,603
- It's more than broke.

438
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,200
If he misses this, he
still owes me 10 grand.

439
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,033
Play the clip.

440
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:44,959
(Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling)

441
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,380
- Oh!
(all exclaiming)

442
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,970
- It is a good clip.

443
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,196
Let's watch it one more time.

444
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:50,406
(Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling)

445
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:51,660
- Oh!
(all exclaiming)

446
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,898
Play it a hundred times on
the screen at the same time.

447
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,056
(Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling)

448
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,220
- Oh!
(all exclaiming)

449
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,053
- Tyler?
- Yes.

450
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,640
- Do you think it's dumb
for him to risk $20,000

451
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,473
for this shot?

452
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:02,354
- Absolutely not, because
it's not my money.

453
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,177
(Chandler slapping ball)
So let's do it.

454
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:05,302
(ball bouncing)
- Chandler! Chandler!

455
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:06,135
- Yeah!

456
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:07,890
(team chanting)
- Chandler! Chandler!

457
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,014
- Oh, that's off.
(buzzer sounding)

458
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:11,760
(Chandler groaning)
- I want to die.

459
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,690
- Buddy.

460
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,010
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

461
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,500
- I need to just stop putting
you in these predicaments.

462
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,333
- Yeah.
(playful music playing)

463
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,510
- I'm just gonna start
just giving you money,

464
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,010
so you can't lose it.

465
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,221
- That would be great.

466
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:22,054
- (laughing) Okay.

467
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:24,030
- 11,150, 11,151, 11,152, 11-

468
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,670
- We can't just let 'em count forever.

469
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,260
Let's give 'em a time limit.

470
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,360
- Jimmy. If you keep letting
them count too much longer,

471
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,071
it's gonna cost you an arm and a leg.

472
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:33,930
(trombone buzzing sadly)

473
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,180
- We have some news we have to break.

474
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,890
You have one hour starting now. Okay.

475
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,690
And then we're gonna come back up,

476
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,130
and give you whatever you're at.

477
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:41,963
- Okay.
- All right.

478
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:43,050
- And you also have to restart?

479
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,890
- No.
(all laughing)

480
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,723
- Oh my God.

481
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,337
- From 11,248, 11,249.

482
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:47,630
- Good luck.
- Have fun.

483
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,463
- 11,251, 11,252-

484
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:50,310
- I hope you make a lot of money.

485
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,143
- Thank you. 11-

486
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:51,976
- Three six five eight nine 10.

487
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:52,809
(Anna screaming)

488
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:53,910
So here's how it works, Troy.

489
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,809
If you guess the cup with
the car key, you win the car.

490
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:57,642
- Oh.

491
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:58,500
- You got this.
- Yes.

492
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,333
- Let's go.

493
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,810
- Karl, I'd like you to escort Troy

494
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,920
where he can't see the cups,

495
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,320
and use this if he gets
a little aggressive.

496
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,610
- Right this way.
(upbeat music playing)

497
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,880
We're gonna teach your swing. Okay?

498
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,370
- Okay.
- Perfect. Just like that.

499
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,203
All right.

500
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:10,148
- All right. So we're gonna take this.

501
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:11,880
(key clattering)

502
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,320
Okay. We're gonna take this.
(cups clattering)

503
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,220
- Looks a little wobbly.

504
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,410
- Keep looking in that direction
and not that direction.

505
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,420
- Troy. Come see if you win a car.

506
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,340
- Okay.
- There's eight cups here.

507
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,020
Two have car keys.

508
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,180
I'm gonna go under here.

509
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,350
- Gosh. You're smart, Jimmy.

510
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,750
- Hover over the cup you
think has a car key in it.

511
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,550
- Don't touch it.

512
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,890
25% chance.
- This one.

513
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,180
- That?
- Yes.

514
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,160
- All right. You wanna lift it up?

515
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,993
- Yes.

516
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:39,277
- Oh, oh-
(all cheering)

517
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,430
- Let's go. Let's go!
(Troy screaming)

518
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,730
- Let's take him out outside
and show him his brand new car.

519
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,105
Tada!

520
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:47,790
- Woo!
(all cheering)

521
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,590
Come on!
- Look at that, man!

522
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,820
- [Karl] Watch out.

523
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,500
- Karl, no.
- Oh. (laughing)

524
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,480
- All right. Hop on in.

525
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,720
- I'm feeling really
good. I won a car, dude.

526
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,010
We good.

527
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,230
- Watching Troy win a car

528
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,799
kind of made me feel bad
for you losing 10 grand.

529
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,931
(Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling)

530
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:06,270
- Oh!
(all exclaiming)

531
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,783
- But you did have this
chance here to win it back.

532
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,310
- Oh, that's off.
(ball bouncing)

533
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,630
- Yeah. I didn't.

534
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,816
- Zach, come here.

535
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:16,156
We're going to let your
brother try to redeem you

536
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,090
and win your 10 grand back.
- Oh my gosh.

537
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,190
- You pick, red balloon or white balloon?

538
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,810
- White.
- Pop a white.

539
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,790
- Go for like the four right
there. You see the four?

540
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,040
- Oh, that's a good idea.

541
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:26,730
(balloon popping)
- Yes!

542
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,600
(cash register dinging)
- Okay.

543
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,160
Step back.

544
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,130
This is for five grand. Pop a red.

545
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,600
- Oh, red?

546
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,917
- Karl, you can just stand over there.

547
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:35,750
(Karl laughing)

548
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,990
- Go for the four right there.

549
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,100
- That one, or that one?

550
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,933
- That one.

551
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:41,011
- Oh. Okay. Wait.

552
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:41,844
(balloon popping)
(cash register dinging)

553
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:42,720
- Yeah. Let's go!

554
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,190
- Okay.
- I'm halfway out of the hole.

555
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,780
- Take a step back.

556
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,880
This one is for $10,000.

557
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,620
Chandley you might wanna hype him up.

558
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,910
- Come on, Zach. You got this.

559
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,077
There's four right here.
Just like we've been doing.

560
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,210
- And don't forget. None of
this money's going to you.

561
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,200
It's for him.

562
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,033
- Yeah. You got this.

563
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:56,970
- That's awesome.

564
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,520
- All right. Pop a red balloon.

565
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,503
I'm nervous.

566
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,165
- I am too.

567
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:02,998
(balloon popping)

568
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:03,831
(cash register dinging)
- Yes, yes.

569
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:04,664
- Let's go.
(palm slapping)

570
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,350
- Okay. Now Chandler,
you are now outta debt.

571
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,639
You lost 10 grand here,

572
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,928
(Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling)

573
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,010
- Oh!
(all exclaiming)

574
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,540
and he just won 10 grand back.

575
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,680
But!
(balloon popping)

576
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,690
He can risk it for 20 grand.

577
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,740
- No.

578
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,270
- Jimmy, I'm going for it. Come on.

579
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,103
- Really?

580
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,423
This is for up 10 grand.
We're good right now.

581
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,370
- We're going for it.

582
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,420
- All right. (laughing)

583
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,098
Chandler, you might be at 10.

584
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:26,931
- Okay.
(balloon popping)

585
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:29,022
(Zach cheering)
(cash register dinging)

586
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,210
- We're rich!

587
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,320
- Well, Chandler got money.

588
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,153
- Wait.

589
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:32,986
- You were playing for Chandler.

590
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:34,350
- You got money.
- Chandler got money.

591
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,490
- Yeah.

592
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,390
- Let's do 30,000.

593
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,902
- Oh my gosh.
- We're not doing it anymore.

594
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:40,500
I'm good. (claps)
- I'm going.

595
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,970
- He's going for it. If you
hit this, you boys get $30,000.

596
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,089
But if you miss-

597
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:46,922
(dart thudding)

598
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,380
- Freak!
(buzzer sounding)

599
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,510
- You're an idiot.
- Oh shit.

600
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,187
(maudlin piano music playing)
- You're an idiot, Zach.

(hat thudding)

602
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,696

603
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,030
Oh wait-

604
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,238

- Bro, it's not that hard.

605
00:16:58,238 --> 00:16:59,970
(balloon popping)
It's not that hard, man.

606
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,280
- At least you two are still
brothers hug it up, hug it up.

607
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,583
We have each other.
- But not 10 grand.

608
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,090
- I'm handsome.
(buzzer sounding)

609
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,180
- The girls' timer just
hit zero formation, boys.

610
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,170
(chanting grunts)

611
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,910
- [Karl] Could you imagine
hearing this coming towards you?

612
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,910
- We should probably stop it.
They might be weirded out.

613
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,743
- 14,439.

614
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:21,410

What is your final number?

615
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,090
- 14,439.

616
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,231

00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:30,870
- What are you gonna buy with it?

619
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,473
- I'm gonna pay my student loans off.

620
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:36,390
