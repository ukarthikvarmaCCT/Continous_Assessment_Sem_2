1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,906
What is its maximum speed?

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,062
If you want to check its maximum speed, come.

3
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:05,007
Oh!

4
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,828
I will move the steering left, the light focus has already turned.

5
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:09,898
I feel like its eyes are moving.

6
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:12,093
The reverse parking camera is hidden.

7
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:12,882
Come and find out where is it.

8
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:14,156
The ground clearance of the car.

9
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,953
When we were coming, the car touched the ground.

10
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:18,054
What if someone tears the fabric of it?

11
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:21,617
We will talk about its advantages and its disadvantages too.

12
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:22,634
Hi friends.

13
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:24,679
After researching for two days,

14
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:26,882
I have learned so many features of this car.

15
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:28,648
We will tell you about these features now.

16
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:30,070
Let's start the video.

17
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,250
Yes. Ok.

18
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,882
So... But first of all, I want to tell you something

19
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:34,500
What?

20
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:36,921
Aayu and Pihu read the comments, and I also saw it,

21
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:39,953
Some friends have commented that we are showing off.

22
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:41,578
We are showing off an expensive car.

23
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:44,171
I read some comments like this.

24
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:46,265
Ok, friends, we were not showing off.

25
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,296
If you buy a new house.

26
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:49,921
So, you throw a party for that.

27
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:51,710
You have a housewarming ceremony.

28
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:52,937
And you invite your friends to your home.

29
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:54,945
We also bought something new.

30
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,118
You are also like our friends and family.

31
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,773
That's why, we are showing you.

32
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,914
We share all our things with you.

33
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:03,054
So we will share it too.

34
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:03,679
Yes.

35
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:06,765
So, what is the first feature? Convertible. Yes.

36
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:09,906
Remove the rooftop of our car.

37
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:10,515
Yes.

38
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:12,685
This will go up.

39
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:16,199
And that will go down. Then everything will go in the trunk of the car.

40
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:18,918
A small trunk. It will close.

41
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,013
OK, friends, so it is open now.

42
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:26,075
It has one more amazing feature.

43
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,700
What?

44
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:29,100
All four windows go down one by one.

45
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,466
Yes. But it has one button for these.

46
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,592
Let me tell you. Ok.

47
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:37,911
Oh, wow!

48
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:39,575
All four windows went down together.

49
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:42,779
When we go on the highway at high speed and

50
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:44,484
We opened the window that time,

51
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:45,879
Then the wind comes very forcefully.

52
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:48,465
So, for that, it also has an air cap.

53
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:50,527
This car has an air cap. Look at this friends.

54
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:51,996
Its air cap is being opened.

55
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,253
Can you see the air cap?

56
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:57,879
It has opened. This is for safety.

57
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,722
Yes. The air pressure won't directly affect us.

58
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,769
It will pass over us. Yes.

59
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,285
Its 4th feature is the seat.

60
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:07,692
Oh, this one. Look from here, this one.

61
00:02:07,717 --> 00:02:11,106
We don't need to push it.

62
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,395
Like, if I want to adjust the seat backwards. It's an electric seat.

63
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:15,578
I want to press the button to adjust the seat backwards.

64
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:16,350
Ok.

65
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:19,335
Friends, it also has a memory function. Yes.

66
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,007
1 2 3.

67
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:23,983
Pihu has set the feature for reclining in this.

68
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:25,352
At sleeping mode.

69
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,356
Done.

70
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:32,257
This feature is for Mom, very advanced, very straight.

71
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:35,141
Look, it's moving forward. Yes.

72
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:37,639
How much have you moved it forward?

73
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,092
Friends, its seat becomes a bit longer.

74
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,232
I'm pressing the button from here. See, this seat will move outward. now.

75
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:44,732
Oh!

76
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:48,364
So that the legs get a bit of support. Yes.

77
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,832
It is called under-thigh support.

78
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:51,631
Pihu, do it. See, your seat is also moving outward.

79
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,787
Yes. Press M and then press 1.

80
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:57,271
Yes. The beeping sound you heard has been stored in its memory.

81
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:58,951
Now, whenever Mom presses the 1 button for the seating position.

82
00:02:59,131 --> 00:03:00,568
The seat will adjust according to Mom.

83
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:01,865
It will move outward.

84
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:03,740
I haven't learnt Kia's function yet.

85
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:05,404
When will I learn its functions?

86
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:09,959
Friends, we will tell you its positive features which are almost 10.

87
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:12,232
However, we will also tell you its negative features.

88
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:14,576
Ok. He will tell you all the features. Yes.

89
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,420
Why did we buy this car?

90
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:17,404
We will tell you that too.

91
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:19,467
The next feature is the music system.

92
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,093
It has 15 speakers.

93
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:22,381
15 speakers?

94
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:23,748
Where are those hidden?

95
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:24,670
They are hidden.

96
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:28,568
Two here, two there, two and two. We can see 8.

97
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,950
Yes. This car's seats also have speakers installed. One is there.

98
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:33,546
One is in the centre. 9.

99
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,803
Some speakers must be installed below as well as above.

100
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,694
It must be installed indoors towards the leg.

101
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,140
Wait, I'm sitting inside.

102
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:40,049
Ok.

103
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,151
Aayu, don't start the car, sit carefully.

104
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,784
It's not on, if it would be on, don't worry, it is in the parking gear.

105
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:47,940
Yes.

106
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:51,823
That's why Aayu has understood it's on parking gear.

107
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:54,823
Increase the volume.

108
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:56,808
Role it.

109
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:03,233
It's real audio.

110
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:05,742
Lower it down.

111
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,179
It is open now.

112
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:12,234
Yes. Even with the car open, the sound is so good.

113
00:04:12,258 --> 00:04:14,640
This sound is enough to party.

114
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:17,586
Right, we can have a party around with music playing.

115
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,742
Yes, but the neighbors will come outside that's why no.

116
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,304
Yes, we can't do this. Ok.

117
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,007
Pause it.

118
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:24,076
Now one more feature. What?

119
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,897
When we sit inside it.

120
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:28,210
After sitting in it.

121
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:30,781
Oh!

122
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:33,470
The seat belt will automatically come forward.

123
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:36,734
It will remind you to fasten your seatbelt.

124
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,156
And move into position automatically.

125
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:41,164
When the car starts, the seat belt automatically tightens securely.

126
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:42,789
It hugs you.

127
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:43,767
Dad. Yes.

128
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:46,617
Then we can't play the radio in this. Why?

129
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,570
Because it has no antenna. We have closed the rooftop.

130
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,326
It means we can't play FM.

131
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:52,335
The radio option is available.

132
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:54,185
Yes, but we can't play. Where is the antenna?

133
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:55,428
Every car has an antenna.

134
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:58,390
The antenna looks like a stick or it is fish-shaped.

135
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,929
Yes. Where is its antenna?

136
00:04:59,954 --> 00:05:02,109
Its antenna is printed on the glass. What?

137
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:04,086
Here, there are very fine lines in groups of three. Yes.

138
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:07,007
Yes. These lines.

139
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:09,414
It has been printed up to this point. Sister, see.

140
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,931
Do antennas like this also exist?

141
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:12,321
Yes. Printed?

142
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,774
There was no space left, that's why they printed it on the glass.

143
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:17,595
They have stuck a sticker on it. Wow! what a technology.

144
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:19,385
We can't recognize it. Dad

145
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,079
Yes. What is its maximum speed?

146
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:22,501
If you want to check its maximum speed, come.

147
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,157
Look at this.

148
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:29,266
Open its menu then set.

149
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:31,470
Then Vehicle.

150
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:34,087
Its maximum speed is 160.

151
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:36,455
But 260 is written here. Is this a lie?

152
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,353
No, we can increase it.

153
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:41,338
You can set its maximum speed limit.

154
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,557
They have given a maximum speed limit.

155
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:47,619
If you set the speed limit to 160, the car will stay within that.

156
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:48,955
No matter how much you accelerate.

157
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:50,697
You can set it to 240.

158
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,213
Yes. We can set it to a maximum of 240.

159
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,666
Ok, I got it. Wow!

160
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:58,041
Anyway, we are not going to drive the car at such high speeds.

161
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:58,901
Because there are no roads for that.

162
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:01,401
Yes. There should be roads like that for driving a car.

163
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:02,901
We have set it to 120.

164
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:05,768
120 is the maximum speed limit in India.

165
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:08,401
That is allowed only on the expressway. Yes.

166
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,697
On other normal highways, a speed of 80 or 100 is allowed.

167
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:12,354
Or 60.

168
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:15,502
Yes, 60 is also allowed. Even in the city, speeds as low as 20 are common.

169
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,482
I drive the car at a speed of 20 only.

170
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,197
Mom!

171
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,018
Now, I'll tell you one more feature. Ok.

172
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:22,034
This is its trunk.

173
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:24,549
What is this?

174
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:26,378
If you want make trunk space.

175
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:29,088
Or if you need to take something out of the trunk?

176
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:30,565
So, this seat goes completely down.

177
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:34,455
If two members are travelling, we can set this up like this.

178
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:36,760
If you have locked someone in the trunk,

179
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,822
They can get out by pressing the button from inside.

180
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,705
That's it, Dad?

181
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:40,862
Is that all the features it has?

182
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,432
These are the features that are not available in normal cars.

183
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:44,456
Besides these, there are other features in it as well.

184
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:45,440
What? Show us.

185
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,041
It has a separate AC.

186
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:48,932
What do you mean?

187
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:49,987
Mom has a separate AC.

188
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,315
This is my AC.

189
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,299
It's a very good thing.

190
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,946
Because I feel cold.

191
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:56,948
And Dad feels hot.

192
00:06:57,206 --> 00:07:01,197
He always sets the AC temperature so low.

193
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,815
That I feel cold.

194
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,924
Not high, low. I mean low.

195
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:08,112
It's showing 25. Mom will set it at 22.

196
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:10,408
And Dad will set it at 18.

197
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,815
17 16. Wow, Dad!

198
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:16,947
OK, friends, let me tell you more features about this car.

199
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:19,814
If the key fob battery has run out.

200
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,299
You have to take out the start and stop buttons?

201
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:26,127
Insert the key fob and turn it.

202
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:27,517
And the car will start.

203
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,017
Friends, this is its touchpad.

204
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:32,572
With this, I can easily browse through all the features.

205
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:36,118
If I need to call someone, I can dial here.

206
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,338
9.

207
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:40,517
8.

208
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:42,447
And you can call.

209
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:43,111
7.

210
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:46,310
It has a safety feature, friends.

211
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:49,066
It has such a big door and there is a light.

212
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:51,698
So that if a car comes from behind, they can see that the door is open.

213
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:52,542
This lights up too.

214
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:53,995
This will focus the light on the ground as well.

215
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:01,458
Friends, I hope, you can see it

216
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:03,006
As soon as I turn the steering wheel slightly,

217
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:04,590
The light turns in that direction.

218
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,332
You will see, when I turn the steering wheel, the light will turn along.

219
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:10,214
Just like eyes. Yes.

220
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,653
See, now I turned the steering straight, the light turned straight.

221
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Yes. See.

222
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:16,503
The light dances here and there.

223
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,622
It will be very beneficial on corners or turns, especially in the dark.

224
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:21,809
And on the highway also.

225
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,711
Yes, you will find it in driving, right?

226
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:26,125
I just feel like its eyes are spinning.

227
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:31,156
The best thing I like about this open roof is,

228
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:37,344
We can open it at night and see the moon and stars.

229
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,304
I love watching it.

230
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,164
There is one more good feature. Get down, you have already seen it.

231
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:49,202
Let me tell to friends, get down, as if Aayu has to go behind.

232
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:51,291
So he will rotate this handle from here,

233
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,822
And will leave the seat forward.

234
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,588
This seat moves forward automatically.

235
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:55,447
Oh...

236
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:58,057
It also gets up and moves forward automatically.

237
00:08:58,073 --> 00:08:59,151
Go inside, take your seat.

238
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:00,471
Ok? And here we sat.

239
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:03,416
As soon as you sit, the seat will back to its original position.

240
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,869
The headrest also came up, as was set.

241
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:07,174
It will take its original position automatically.

242
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,697
The seat was a bit over relaxed now Pihu cannot fit properly.

243
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:12,402
Look, when Pihu touched the seat, it moved forward back.

244
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:16,526
Pihu was saying that Mom had moved the seat very far forward.

245
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,332
The reason for adjusting the seat forward was so

246
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:19,730
That you could sit comfortably.

247
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:20,963
Yes, OK.

248
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:25,160
The reverse parking camera is hidden in it.

249
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:25,951
Come and find it.

250
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:26,911
We can't see it.

251
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,068
Search.

252
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,889
Come. The camera is certainly installed at the back.

253
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:32,654
It is in the back. The reverse camera will be in the back only.

254
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,450
Mom can say anything.

255
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:35,787
The back camera is in the back only.

256
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,807
Who knows, a camera may fly in and come at the back.

257
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:40,987
These should be its two eyes.

258
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:42,457
No. Yes, these are its eyes.

259
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,614
I know, it's inside the lights.

260
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,284
Like its antenna. No. No, I know.

261
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,637
There is a camera installed inside the exhaust.

262
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:52,642
Wow! The camera will burn inside the exhaust.

263
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,157
Or maybe the camera is installed at the bottom? Here?

264
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:57,212
I know. Here...

265
00:09:57,532 --> 00:10:00,259
No, that is the reverse parking sensor.

266
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:03,768
It shows me in the rear view mirror how close the car has come.

267
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:06,759
So it is here.

268
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:09,291
Let me show you, you found it, right?

269
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,018
Yes. Okay, I'll show you.

270
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:12,877
This camera will appear when we put it in reverse gear.

271
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:13,824
It's not somewhere down here, isn't it?

272
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,846
You could see, but you can't see.

273
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:16,871
Show us?

274
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:22,307
It would come from here.

275
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:24,845
Back off, Dad will reverse it.

276
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,379
Oh!

277
00:10:27,404 --> 00:10:28,247
Here is it.

278
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:30,802
We saw it.

279
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:32,098
Hello. Hello.

280
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:33,161
Can you see us?

281
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,653
Hello...

282
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:37,924
But I did not understand. It's cheating.

283
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:39,816
Why have you kept it hidden?

284
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:41,247
Is it to avoid the evil eye?

285
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:42,067
Yes.

286
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:44,169
This is cool.

287
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,450
This saves the camera from dust.

288
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,598
Otherwise, if we go somewhere in the dust,

289
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:51,700
Dust sticks to the camera and we have to clean it again and again.

290
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:54,966
Yes. The high-end cars...

291
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:57,380
Like a windscreen washer from which water comes out.

292
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,887
There is also a washer for such cameras, a small one in those cars.

293
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,050
But you did the cheating.

294
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:05,458
What? When we came to see it, you had not even opened it.

295
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:08,107
You should have put it in reverse gear first. Yes.

296
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,669
Okay, so now let us also tell its negative points.

297
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:13,090
Yes, tell us that too.

298
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,254
Keep listening one by one.

299
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:15,669
There are many.

300
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:16,583
But? Yes,

301
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,908
It is not like that you show us negative points,

302
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:20,065
And say that we will send the car back.

303
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,372
No, it has come now. We won't send it back.

304
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:25,289
We will tell you in the end why we have bought the car, okay?

305
00:11:25,314 --> 00:11:29,317
Before the negative point, we could not decide its name.

306
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,403
We can ask friends to suggest the name for this car.

307
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:35,778
Good! You will comment and tell us,

308
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,818
The most common comments,

309
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:40,786
Or whatever name we all like, we will name it.

310
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:44,129
Of course and we will tell who told its name,

311
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:44,754
Ok.

312
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:49,426
Okay, tell us good names like what is the name of our KIA, Miss Kerry.

313
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,504
So the name of this car is Mercedes-Benz,

314
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,473
The model is C300.

315
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:56,051
Its style is called Cabriolet.

316
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:57,638
Cabriolet?

317
00:11:57,755 --> 00:11:58,755
Miss Cabri.

318
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:00,254
Miss Cabri!

319
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:01,809
Miss Kerry and Miss Cabri.

320
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,137
Friends, you have to suggest to us.

321
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:04,184
Yes, you will tell us.

322
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,770
Let's move on to the first negative point.

323
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:07,051
Ground clearance.

324
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,106
We have to pass through the breaker very slowly,

325
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,223
Otherwise, the car gets stuck at the bottom.

326
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:13,575
And if all four of us are seated,

327
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:16,004
Friends, when we were coming, the car had touched the ground.

328
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:17,598
Yes, the car got stuck in one place.

329
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,786
Or when I am sitting alone, then there is no problem.

330
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:21,012
I'm not that fat.

331
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:24,247
You are the fattest among us.

332
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:27,686
Of course one person weighs less than four.

333
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:28,426
Yes.

334
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:32,098
Reduce your waist a little.

335
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:34,551
Yes, second now?

336
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,184
Second, you will tell.

337
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:36,926
Let me tell you.

338
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:39,453
Yes. There is no trunk, it has no space for keeping luggage.

339
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,411
If the four of us are going somewhere,

340
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,786
Can't go at all.

341
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:44,637
This car is not suitable for the highway.

342
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:47,247
But now we can drive this car on the highway.

343
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,067
So the biggest problem is when to go on the highway.

344
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,161
We can drive it at speed on the highway.

345
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:52,872
To drive, we will have to go to the highway.

346
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,544
Yes. If we go, we will have to stay overnight,

347
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:55,732
But where will we keep our luggage?

348
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:58,919
Let's do one thing, Dad, Aayu and I will sit in this Mercedes.

349
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:59,933
Mom in KIA.

350
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:02,723
Ok, it's done, tell me more negative points.

351
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:03,934
Two negative points are done. Yes.

352
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,097
Now whoever tells will get chocolate.

353
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:07,254
What is this?

354
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:10,410
The third negative point is its seat space.

355
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:11,911
There is very little space inside the car.

356
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:14,153
The front seats are super comfortable.

357
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:16,286
But the rear seat is straight.

358
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:19,372
Sister will sit, after 2 years I will not be able to sit.

359
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:20,489
There is no charger at the back either.

360
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:22,583
Aayu Pihu were saying the same, there is no charger.

361
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,848
Now how will they charge the phone?

362
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:26,270
Yes. It is in front, isn't it?

363
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:30,536
Yes. Look, this type of car is considered a 2 seater.

364
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,739
What? What?

365
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:43,458
And yes Dad, one more negative point. Come.

366
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:46,301
This is fine, leg space is still fine but...

367
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,598
There is no seperate door to enter. Where do we enter from?

368
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:51,285
First, we must get out of the car, then they can sit back.

369
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,356
Otherwise, they can't sit.

370
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:55,692
Yes, if the roof is open, then jump and sit.

371
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:56,786
Yes, now give me the chocolate.

372
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,364
Let me tell you, there is no night lamp behind, give me the chocolate.

373
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:04,208
Let me tell you, there is no safety, give me the chocolate.

374
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,254
How is there no safety? Tell us how is there no safety?

375
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:11,614
Well, the roof is open. Yes...

376
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:13,698
The roof is open, there is no safety.

377
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:15,348
This car is not safe. Yes.

378
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,518
And the biggest point...

379
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,348
We cannot drive the car with the roof open in the rain.

380
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,333
We can't drive in storms, extreme heat and sunlight.

381
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:26,137
And even if we did,

382
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:29,583
So pollution, dust, everything will come.

383
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:30,738
And stink.

384
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:33,708
We can smell everything if we drive with open roof.

385
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:34,325
Yes.

386
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:36,192
We can't open it and leave it.

387
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:38,520
Yes. And even if we close it and leave it,

388
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:40,778
What if someone cuts this fabric and goes away?

389
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,286
No, it is strong in this thing.

390
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:44,238
Good.

391
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:46,622
The cloth on it, the hooded cloth on top.

392
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,989
It is made of bulletproof jacket cloth.

393
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,965
Good. So it won't even cut normally.

394
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:55,715
One positive. Ok.

395
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:57,434
Well, there are a lot of positive points.

396
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:01,872
We are happy with you.

397
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,622
Our last point is why we have bought this car.

398
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:07,629
The convertible looks good, and everyone likes it.

399
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:11,121
And the hard work done by Aayu-Pihu for 7 years,

400
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:12,489
in making 500 videos,

401
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,754
Because of this, both of them have received this gift.

402
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:16,622
Because they wanted a convertible car.

403
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:18,864
Because we have to consider their wishes.

404
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:21,307
They have done a lot of efforts since childhood.

405
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:23,176
Thank you, Dad, and thank you, Mom.

406
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:25,036
Thank you to all of you too.

407
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:30,059
Because of your support, we were able to get this car.

408
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,416
Tell us by commenting what should we name this car.

409
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:34,025
Yes, please name it.

410
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,594
Bye.
