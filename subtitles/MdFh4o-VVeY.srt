1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,287
"Now I am become death,

2
00:00:02,287 --> 00:00:03,844
the destroyer of worlds."

3
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:05,080
Hello, friends!

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,188
16th July 1945,

5
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:09,033
around 5.30 in the morning.

6
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:12,025
In the desert of America's state New Mexico,

7
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,867
a bomb explodes.

8
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:15,801
But this is not a normal bomb explosion.

9
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,358
This was the first time

10
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:20,206
a nuclear bomb was being tested.

11
00:00:20,206 --> 00:00:21,301
5,

12
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,191
4,

13
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,173
3,

14
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:24,103
2,

15
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:25,040
1!

16
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,277
This nuclear test was codenamed Trinity

17
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,702
and the project was led by

18
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:32,264
scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer.

19
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,527
Oppenheimer was shocked to see this bomb blast.

20
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:38,535
He had expected the size of the explosion to be

21
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:41,109
around 0.3 kilotons of TNT.

22
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:45,021
But in reality, this blast was 50 times more dangerous.

23
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:47,606
15-20 kilotons of TNT.

24
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:50,119
The blast released so much heat

25
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,959
that a steel tower evaporated.

26
00:00:55,637 --> 00:01:00,115
The shockwave was felt from a distance of 160 km.

27
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:05,682
The mushroom cloud that erupted went up to 12 km in the sky.

28
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:08,137
Upon seeing all this, Oppenheimer was so shocked that

29
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:11,136
he uttered a line from the Bhagavad Gita.

30
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:12,647
"Now I am become death,

31
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:14,871
the destroyer of worlds."

32
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:16,518
"Now I am become death,

33
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:18,638
the destroyer of worlds."

34
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:22,369
You might be asking; how did Oppenheimer know about Bhagavad Gita?

35
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,181
We will talk about that later in the video.

36
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,541
Since Christopher Nolan made a new film.

37
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,710
So I thought this would be the right opportunity to make a video on him.

38
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,974
What was his story?

39
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,665
How did he develop the nuclear bomb?

40
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:36,219
Was Oppenheimer a hero or a villain?

41
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:38,095
And how did he feel

42
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:42,568
when millions of people lost their lives because of his creation?

43
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:44,445
Let's find out in today's video.

44
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:51,890
Julius Robert Oppenheimer

45
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,581
is known as the father of the atomic bomb.

46
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,911
He was the director of the Manhattan Project

47
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,901
that created the first nuclear weapons.

48
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:01,486
Let's start this story from his childhood.

49
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:03,790
He was born in 1904

50
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,658
to a German Jewish family in New York City.

51
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:10,833
And he was considered a child genius since childhood.

52
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,542
He was studying high-level physics and chemistry at the age of only 10.

53
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,807
And he was very knowledgeable about mineralogy.

54
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:18,622
About property of minerals.

55
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:21,422
He was so knowledgeable that at the age of 12

56
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:25,021
he was invited to give a lecture at New York's Mineralogical Club.

57
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,223
Later in 1922,

58
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:29,459
when he went to Harvard to study,

59
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,586
he completed his 4-year degree in 3 years.

60
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,291
He was at the top of his class.

61
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,739
He majored in chemistry

62
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,680
and he was knowledgeable about many subjects.

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,370
Physics, philosophy, literature,

64
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,182
and even Eastern religion.

65
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:43,515
But in Harvard, he realized that among all these subjects,

66
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:45,878
his real passion was physics.

67
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:49,490
Later in 1927, at the age of 23,

68
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,279
he did his PhD.

69
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:54,553
But there was a dark side hidden behind this genius.

70
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:58,811
His friends said that Oppenheimer had self-destructive tendencies.

71
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,569
He was a chain smoker

72
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,142
and was suffering through depression.

73
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:04,206
One day, he told his brother,

74
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:06,387
I need physics more than friends.

75
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,655
He was focused only on his studies

76
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,376
and remained unaware of what was happening in the world around him.

77
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,995
Until the early 1930s,

78
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,562
when Adolf Hitler rose in Germany.

79
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:19,974
He gradually became more politically aware.

80
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,735
Because of Hitler's tyranny,

81
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:25,093
many German scientists were fleeing from Germany to America.

82
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,663
There were many big names on this list.

83
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:27,819
Like Albert Einstein.

84
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,239
John von Neumann,

85
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,613
who pioneered modern computers.

86
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:32,766
Leo Szilard,

87
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:35,586
who will play an important role in our story.

88
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,592
Hans Bethe,

89
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,109
who discovered fusion in stars.

90
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,288
Edward Teller,

91
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:42,459
who is called the father of the hydrogen bomb.

92
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:43,907
And Enrico Fermi,

93
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:47,083
who will play another important role in our story.

94
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,819
All these scientists mainly were German-Jewish

95
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,790
and because Oppenheimer himself came from a German-Jewish family,

96
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,882
when he started paying attention to the atrocities on Jews,

97
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:57,940
his interest in politics started developing.

98
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,269
This is his quote from 1936.

99
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:06,874
"I started to understand how deeply political 
and economic events affect people's lives.

100
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:11,286
I felt the need to participate in this community."

101
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:13,512
Influenced by the left-wing ideology

102
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:15,310
he went to many political meetings.

103
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,457
And donated money to many labour unions and striking farm workers.

104
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:21,012
In September 1939,

105
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,095
Hitler invaded Poland,

106
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,077
which was the beginning of World War 2.

107
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:28,249
As I explained in my video on World War 2,

108
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:30,183
America was not interested

109
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:31,746
in getting involved in this war.

110
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:34,907
But still, America was preparing for the worst.

111
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,561
Actually, what happened was that

112
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:38,178
a month before the war started,

113
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,744
in August 1939,

114
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:42,969
Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard wrote a letter

115
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:45,869
to American President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

116
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,692
In this letter, they warned the American President

117
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:51,613
that Hitler is working on nuclear weapons.

118
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:55,930
And that he may be successful in making this extremely powerful bomb.

119
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,705
That's why America should be prepared.

120
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:00,184
As soon as he read this letter, the American President

121
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:02,632
set up an advisory committee on uranium.

122
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:04,074
Taking immediately action.

123
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:06,733
A team of scientists and military officials was formed.

124
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:10,066
Their job was to research the potential of uranium.

125
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,525
Can uranium be made into a weapon?

126
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,289
After the findings of this committee,

127
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:19,006
the American government started funding Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard.

128
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:22,660
For researching how nuclear chain reactions work.

129
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,164
And how to separate the isotopes of uranium.

130
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:30,431
The thing is that the naturally found uranium on earth

131
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:33,121
is the uranium-238 isotope.

132
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:37,500
Less than 1% of the uranium is actually a U-235 isotope.

133
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,063
And only this U-235 isotope,

134
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:42,772
could be used to make the bomb.

135
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:45,199
The first challenge for these scientists

136
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,350
was to find a way to make uranium-235

137
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,670
using the uranium-238.

138
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,900
But the scientists working on this project

139
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,203
were told not to tell Albert Einstein anything.

140
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:56,766
Because the American government was afraid

141
00:05:56,766 --> 00:06:00,625
that Albert Einstein's ideology was very left-wing.

142
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,571
It could have been a potential security risk.

143
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,218
As you know, Albert Einstein was one of those people

144
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:09,005
who used to sleep for 10 hours a night.

145
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:10,882
He knew the importance of sleep

146
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:13,712
and he used to take strategic naps in the day.

147
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:17,519
Compare this to today's social media motivational gurus

148
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,863
who tell you that you should not waste time sleeping.

149
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:23,453
They tell fraud stories of how the successful people

150
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:25,618
sleep only for 5-6 hours a night.

151
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,541
All lies.

152
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,340
The truth is that regular and sufficient sleep

153
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,679
is very important for every human being.

154
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,848
Apart from a few exceptions,

155
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:35,356
every human being needs to sleep for 7-9 hours

156
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:37,362
to be at the top of their health.

157
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:41,436
Especially if you want to maximize your productivity and happiness.

158
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:43,430
And if you haven't joined yet,

159
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,392

Now, let's come back to the topic.

175
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:22,644
Oppenheimer was doing his independent research

176
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:25,626
on nuclear fission with Edward Teller and other scientists.

177
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:28,099
December 1940.

178
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,664
Apart from the Uranium-235 isotope,

179
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:33,318
another radioactive element was discovered

180
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:34,951
which scientists believe

181
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:38,364
could also be used to make nuclear weapons.

182
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:40,590
The name of this element was Plutonium.

183
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,475
On 11th October 1941

184
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:46,729
American President sends a message to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill

185
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:49,971
saying that both countries should collaborate

186
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,781
for atomic development.

187
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:53,539
Not even 2 months later

188
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,502
that on 7th December 1941,

189
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:58,090
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor

190
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,049
and America officially entered World War 2.

191
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,191
"A state of war

192
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,968
has existed between

193
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:09,258
the United States and the Japanese Empire."

194
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:11,454
American President Roosevelt announced that

195
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:13,859
America will become a part of the Allied powers

196
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,644
who were fighting against Germany and Japan.

197
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,510
If you want to know the whole story of World War 2,

198
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,081
I have made two videos on it.

199
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:21,391
Part 1 and part 2,

200
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:23,323
and detailed everything from start to end.

201
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,319
If you haven't seen it, I will put the link in the description

202
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,147
you can watch them after this video.

203
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:29,297
But at this point in time, it becomes clear that

204
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:33,552
the scientific mission of developing nuclear weapons

205
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:36,182
had turned into a military mission. 

206
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,061
America spent $2.2 billion

207
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,653
on this one project.

208
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:45,022
Taking inflation into account, it is equivalent to $24 billion today.

209
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:46,855
Almost 2 trillion Indian rupees.

210
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:49,623
The American military had an engineering wing

211
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:51,590
the Army Corps of Engineers.

212
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,548
It made ports and airfields for the army.

213
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:58,996
Its involvement was approved by President Roosevelt

214
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,741
in June 1942.

215
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:05,094
Now, the office of the North Atlantic Division was in Manhattan, New York City.

216
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:08,025
And when they got the responsibility to make nuclear weapons,

217
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:11,718
they made their headquarters in the same building, on the 18th floor.

218
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,910
These headquarters were named Manhattan Engineer District

219
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,226
and from this point in time,

220
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:19,580
the Manhattan Project officially started.

221
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,343
The date was 13th August 1942.

222
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:24,148
Next month, on 17th September,

223
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,466
Colonel Leslie Richard Groves

224
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,639
was appointed as the head of the project.

225
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,162
And he made the decision to

226
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:34,715
appoint Oppenheimer as the leader of the design of the atomic bomb.

227
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:38,999
A secret location was decided to keep this project under cover.

228
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:41,450
Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

229
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,818
This city is also called the Secret City

230
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:46,592
because an entire city was built here

231
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:48,171
only for this project.

232
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,279
Thousands of scientists, researchers, and workers

233
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,037
were moved to this city

234
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:53,877
and they had only one task.

235
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,957
Creating Uranium-235 from Uranium-238.

236
00:09:56,957 --> 00:10:00,743
I will not go into the details of the science of nuclear fission

237
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,931
because I explained it in the video on Chernobyl.

238
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,589
You can watch that video if you want to understand it in detail.

239
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,158
The point is that Uranium-238

240
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:11,866
is not very fissionable.

241
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:13,675
It cannot undergo a chain reaction

242
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:15,473
to make a bomb.

243
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:18,208
It was very important to extract Uranium-235.

244
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:22,061
Only Uranium-235 can undergo a chain reaction

245
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:24,026
which is why it was required.

246
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:26,913
The plan was to try out 4 different methods

247
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:28,930
to make U-235 from U-238.

248
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,201
Gaseous diffusion,

249
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:31,244
centrifuge,

250
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,045
electromagnetic separation,

251
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:35,123
and liquid thermal diffusion.

252
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:37,896
After testing these 4 different technologies,

253
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:41,045
2 technologies proved to be successful to some extent.

254
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:44,020
Electromagnetic separation and gaseous diffusion.

255
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,088
In electromagnetic separation,

256
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:52,662
a large magnet is used to separate U-235 from U-238.

257
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:54,275
In gaseous diffusion,

258
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:55,960
Uranium-hexafluoride gas

259
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,359
is passed through a porous membrane

260
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:01,804
in which the light molecules of U-235

261
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:02,884
pass successfully.

262
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:06,747
But since the U-238 molecules are heavier

263
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,267
and they get filtered out.

264
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,048
Apart from this, at a different location in Washington,

265
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:13,932
scientists were at work producing Plutonium as well.

266
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:18,003
Plutonium is also produced from Uranium 238.

267
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:20,653
When an isotope of hydrogen

268
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:23,061
is bombarded with Uranium 238

269
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:25,062
then plutonium is produced.

270
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:27,588
Later it was found that plutonium

271
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:30,494
is more radioactive and more fissionable

272
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:32,640
as compared to Uranium 235.

273
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,302
Apart from these two locations,

274
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:36,541
they were looking for a third location.

275
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,517
For Project Y.

276
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:41,376
A location where the actual work of

277
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:44,152
designing and making these bombs would take place.

278
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:47,548
General Groves wanted a remote location for this.

279
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:49,937
So that the project could remain a secret.

280
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:53,575
Oppenheimer knew exactly such a location.

281
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:57,670
It is a place where Oppenheimer spent his summers happily.

282
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,989
Surrounded by mountains and beautiful landscapes,

283
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:02,933
the Pecos Valley in New Mexico.

284
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,802
After setting up all these locations,

285
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,820
there was only one obvious thing left to do.

286
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,258
To practically test out a chain reaction.

287
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:12,614
Everything was theoretical till now.

288
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:14,634
So they needed proof on whether

289
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,541
the whole concept of the atomic bomb

290
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,755
was feasible or not.

291
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,813
2nd December 1942.

292
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:25,480
Scientist Enrico Fermi conducted the first successful practical experiment.

293
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,413
In a squash court of the University of Chicago,

294
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,253
he ran a chain reaction,

295
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:33,216
which helps light up a bulb.

296
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:35,207
"The clickety-clack of their instruments,

297
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,968
proved they had achieved 

298
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:40,485
the first human-made nuclear chain reaction."

299
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:43,317
By this point, General Groves

300
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:46,177
was impressed with Oppenheimer's ability.

301
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:49,758
He wanted to appoint him as the director of Project Y.

302
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:52,245
But some senior members of the military

303
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,549
doubted Oppenheimer.

304
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:55,908
The same way that they doubted Albert Einstein.

305
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,826
Many friends of Oppenheimer,

306
00:12:57,826 --> 00:13:00,047
his wife, and in fact, his brother,

307
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,168
were all hard-core communists.

308
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:04,894
He was influenced by the left-wing ideology himself.

309
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:07,637
America was afraid that this communist ideology

310
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,518
could go against their country.

311
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,305
But despite these concerns,

312
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:14,718
General Groves personally supported Oppenheimer

313
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:16,379
and said that

314
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,734
this project could not happen without Oppenheimer.

315
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,551
And that he was essential for this project.

316
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:23,459
And because of this, on 20th July 1943,

317
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,536
Oppenheimer was made the lead of this project.

318
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:28,314
To make an atom bomb,

319
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:30,604
Oppenheimer's expertise was required

320
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:32,673
in the calculation of critical mass.

321
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:36,025
Critical mass is basically a minimum amount of mass

322
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,518
of Uranium-235 or Plutonium

323
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,217
which is needed to have a chain reaction,

324
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:43,157
to sustain a chain reaction.

325
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:46,836
The minimum amount of radioactive elements that would be needed

326
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:49,460
to carry out a chain reaction and a bomb blast.

327
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,668
It seems easy today,

328
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,749
but there were many unknown factors at that time.

329
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,157
We hardly knew anything about the properties of Uranium-235.

330
00:13:57,157 --> 00:14:02,015
Plutonium-239 was actually discovered in 1940.

331
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,887
And by the end of 1943,

332
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,913
only 2 milligrams of plutonium could be produced.

333
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:10,235
That's why America was developing two atom bombs.

334
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:13,388
The first bomb was based on Uranium-235,

335
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:15,178
named Little Boy.

336
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:17,951
The mechanism of this bomb was basically

337
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,332
a gun-type design.

338
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:22,993
Two masses of Uranium-235 were taken,

339
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:24,424
which were sub-critical.

340
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:25,723
Less than the critical value.

341
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:28,332
And they were combined rapidly with each other.

342
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:30,994
With this combination, the critical mass was reached

343
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:33,769
and a fission chain reaction follows

344
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,518
resulting in an explosion.

345
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:39,740
The second bomb was the plutonium bomb

346
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,482
which was using plutonium-239

347
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,080
and its name was Fat Man.

348
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,084
It was more difficult to design.

349
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:48,263
Here, it could not be designed as a gun

350
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:52,376
because if the masses of two plutonium were combined,

351
00:14:52,376 --> 00:14:54,476
it would react very quickly

352
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,272
and the fission reaction would end before the critical mass could be reached.

353
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:02,231
"A Plutonium gun-bomb would melt, not explode."

354
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,484
Here, scientists created a different design for the plutonium bomb.

355
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:10,033
The mass of plutonium was to be placed under high pressure and density

356
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,527
in a spherical structure.

357
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:15,550
A sub-critical mass of plutonium was placed inside a hollow sphere.

358
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,968
And outside the sphere, explosives were used

359
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:21,500
to create an implosion in the mass of plutonium.

360
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,670
When the explosives outside exploded,

361
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,597
the plutonium would be under high pressure

362
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:27,700
and it would reach the critical mass.

363
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,299
This concept was called the implosion method.

364
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:33,578
Scientists already knew about the gun method,

365
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:37,387
but this was the first time that the implosion method was theoretically mentioned.

366
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:40,337
Oppenheimer believed that it was necessary to test it out

367
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:42,926
before actually putting it in the bomb.

368
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:44,849
General Groves said that

369
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:46,516
they can't test such things because

370
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:49,217
they had produced only a small amount of plutonium.

371
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:50,947
But Oppenheimer was adamant that

372
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:52,299
the test was necessary.

373
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:53,913
So General Groves had to finally agree.

374
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:56,821
And then, friends, the Trinity Test was conducted.

375
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:59,057
I talked about this at the beginning of the video.

376
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,142
In the desert of New Mexico,

377
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:03,697
a test nuclear bomb was dropped

378
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,152
This test bomb was called Gadget.

379
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:08,776
It contained 13 pounds of plutonium.

380
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:14,278
Scientists hung Gadget 100 ft in the air using a steel tower.

381
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,902
And on 16th July 1945,

382
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:18,452
at 5.30 am,

383
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:20,462
this bomb was detonated.

384
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,230
As I told you,

385
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,172
this bomb was much more powerful than Oppenheimer expected.

386
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:32,664
The steel tower completely evaporated.

387
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:37,379
After the bomb blast, a mildly radioactive green-coloured glass was formed,

388
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,143
which was named Trinitite.

389
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:40,808
It was after seeing this blast,

390
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:44,440
that Oppenheimer uttered some lines of the Bhagavad Gita.

391
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:46,547
"Now I am become death,

392
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:48,601
the destroyer of worlds.

393
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,701
I suppose we all thought that,

394
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:53,799
one way or another."

395
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:57,142
Actually, Oppenheimer was a Sanskrit scholar

396
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,745
and he had studied the entire Bhagavad Gita

397
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:00,859
in its original form.

398
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:05,074
He describes the Bhagavad Gita as one of the most influential books of his life.

399
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:08,141
Less than a month after the Trinity test,

400
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:10,961
on 6th August 1945,

401
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:14,114
the Little Boy bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.

402
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,647
If that wasn't enough,

403
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:19,605
then three days later, this plutonium Fat Man bomb

404
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,532
was dropped on Nagasaki too.

405
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:28,786
What was the effect of dropping these atomic bombs?

406
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:32,665
I have discussed this in detail in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki video.

407
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:35,978
Albert Einstein's first reaction

408
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:37,444
upon hearing this news was

409
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,012
"Woe is me."

410
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:41,036
A melancholy statement.

411
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:43,640
It is believed that Albert Einstein also said this.

412
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,650
"Mankind invented the atomic bomb,

413
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,468
but no mouse would ever construct a mousetrap."

414
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:52,614
Oppenheimer expressed happiness after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.

415
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,644
He wished that this bomb

416
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:58,224
could be used against Nazi Germany and Hitler.

417
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:00,546
But when the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki,

418
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,884
Oppenheimer was shocked.

419
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:05,520
On 17th August, he went to Washington

420
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,145
to meet the Secretary of War.

421
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:10,582
To hand-deliver the letter he wrote.

422
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:12,152
He directly said that

423
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,111
he wanted to ban nuclear weapons.

424
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:16,244
He was very regretful 

425
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:17,558
about his part in it.

426
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:20,974
The technology he handed over to humas.

427
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:25,694
Oppenheimer considered the first bomb dropped on Hiroshima as a necessary evil.

428
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:28,706
But now he was afraid for the future.

429
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:32,240
What will different countries do with this technology in the future?

430
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,413
In the meantime, in April 1945,

431
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,125
American President Roosevelt passed away.

432
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,902
The next American President was Harry Truman.

433
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:43,012
Two months after the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki,

434
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:45,440
Oppenheimer got a chance

435
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,002
to meet President Truman.

436
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,686
When meeting the President, he said directly,

437
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:51,480
"I have blood on my hands."

438
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:55,767
And President Truman was so angry after hearing this that

439
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,899
he started shouting at him.

440
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:01,868
He told his secretary to throw Oppenheimer out of the office

441
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:03,946
and that he didn't want to see his face ever again.

442
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:08,124
Oppenheimer later worked with the US Atomic Energy Commission

443
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:11,102
to stop other such nuclear attacks.

444
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:14,618
He wanted to establish control over nuclear weapons.

445
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:19,039
In 1949, when President Truman approached the commission

446
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,653
with the idea of making a hydrogen bomb,

447
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:26,155
Oppenheimer strongly opposed it.

448
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:28,726
But this opposition was of no use

449
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:32,031
because America developed a hydrogen bomb later

450
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:35,387
and also conducted tests in 1952.

451
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,890
Edward Teller was the scientist

452
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,378
who helped in making this hydrogen bomb.

453
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:46,839
And he is called the Father of the Hydrogen Bomb today.

454
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,860
Because of Oppenheimer's resistance

455
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,133
and his left-wing ideology,

456
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,649
his job was snatched away from him.

457
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:57,311
He spent the rest of his life in the academic profession

458
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,649
and used to give lectures all over the world.

459
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:02,814
Even though he was nominated for the Nobel Prize thrice,

460
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:04,744
he could not win even once.

461
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:07,330
In 1965, due to throat cancer,

462
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,916
Oppenheimer died at the age of 62.

463
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,567
Which was not surprising

464
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:15,935
as he was a terrible chain smoker throughout his life.

465
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:18,491
Today, there are 9 countries

466
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:20,499
that have nuclear weapons.

467
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,247
India, Pakistan, China,

468
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:24,305
the USA, France, the UK,

469
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:27,053
Israel, Russia, and North Korea.

470
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,886
But the positive thing is that in the last 80 years,

471
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:34,349
no other nuclear weapon has been used.

472
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:37,399
If you liked the video, you can learn the whole story of Chernobyl

473
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,568
in this video by clicking here.

474
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:42,772
You will be able to understand a little more about nuclear reactions.

475
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:44,152
See you in the next video.

476
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:45,353
Thank you very much!
