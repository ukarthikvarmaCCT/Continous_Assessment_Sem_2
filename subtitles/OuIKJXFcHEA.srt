00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,359
is one of the most admired and feared

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,560
attack helicopters

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,639

name is hind

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,080

many parts of the world

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400

preferred by more than 60 countries the

00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,879
mi 24

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,199
is the most widely used helicopter and

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:01,920
has fought

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,400
in many parts of the world it has been

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,680
an important system

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
that couldn't be ignored not only by

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
western military planners

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,159
but also by hollywood don't you think a

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,640
puma that resembles the mi 24

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,159
deserved the award for the best

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,560
supporting actor and made ramba 2 and

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,360
rambo 3

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,680
a part of the list of legendary movies

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,720
too

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
and isn't it possible to see its impact

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
even in the struggle for life and death

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,640
between jedi and sit in a galaxy far

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,600
far away although it has become a legend

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,400
today

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,640
in the beginning the faith of soviet

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
military planners about the mi 24

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,720
was very low in the early 1960s

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
the soviet mill company started to work

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,720
on an innovative system

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
which was basically a flying infantry

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,399
fighting vehicle

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,720
it meant that the new helicopter should

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,000
be able to perform

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
both fire support and infantry transport

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,840
duties

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,280
in 1966 mill unveiled a mock-up to

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,840
demonstrate its new concept

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
the value of this new concept was

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,840
immediately apparent to some

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,440
but many were skeptical of it yet

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
the us army's successful use of gunship

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,280
helicopters in vietnam

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,200
ended the debate between these two

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
groups in a short time

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,319
thus mill presented two conceptual

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,440
designs

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,520
one was the comparatively small and

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,800
single engine

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,879
and the other was the heavy and twin

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,080
engine

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
kamov also offered a version of the

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
ka-25 naval helicopter

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
as a low-cost solution for this

72
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,599
requirement

73
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,200
after extensive consideration in 1968

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
the soviet army's preference was mel's

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,239
heavy helicopter concept

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,920
flight test of mills helicopter

77
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,480
prototype began one year later

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,959
in simple term it was a highly modified

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:53,840
mi-8

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,080
whose nato reporting name is hip for

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,239
gunship helicopter world

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,920
many airframe components and

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,879
sub-component came from mi-8

84
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,159
and its naval variant mi14 whose nato

85
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,959
reporting name

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,080
is haze in 1970

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,360
acceptance tests started after 18 months

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,159
of trials

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,120
many changes were required for example

90
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,000
the fuselage was

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,920
strengthened to solve fatigue problems

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
and vibration levels

93
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,840
the position of anti-tank missile pylons

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
was moved from the fuselage to the

95
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,120
wingtips

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,280
after these changes the mass production

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,480
of the helicopter

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,480
now called mi24a started in 1970.

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,000
it became operational in 1972.

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,360
however the mi 24a was more like a test

101
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,000
platform

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,640
than a real gunship helicopter while

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
mass production of this model continued

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,360
the mill engineers had to deal with many

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
design flaws

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,599
for example the three blade tail rotor

107
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,360
which was on the starboard in the first

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
production versions of the mi 24a

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,159
had been repositioned to the port site

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,280
to increase efficiency in later models

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,439
also the design of the cockpit was

112
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,720
causing an inadequate view for the pilot

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,680
the mi 24d whose mass production began

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
in 1973

115
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,920
has ended these problems unlike its

116
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
predecessor

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
this model has a tandem cockpit with a

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,359
double bubble canopy

119
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,000
the rear seat is 30 centimeters higher

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
than the front

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
all later versions of the helicopter

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
have this configuration

123
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
the pilot and the gunner seat inside the

124
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,000
titanium armored tub

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,960
in the cockpit their windscreens are

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,479
bulletproof

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,880
in an emergency the gunner can also fly

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
the helicopter

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,639
thanks to the over pressurized cockpit

130
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,080
and troop compartment

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,720
the helicopter can be operated in an nbc

132
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
environment

133
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,240
the armored fuselush and the titanium

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
rotor blades are resistant against

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,759
12.7 millimeter rounds there are three

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,360
pylons on the mid mounted stop wings

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,240
at high speed they provide considerable

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,759
lift

139
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,000
the design of airframe has high

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,479
aerodynamic efficiency

141
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,680
also the mi 24 fitted with retractable

142
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
landing gear to reduce track

143
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,320
these futures make the helicopter fast

144
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,800
unlike other attack helicopters the mi

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,440
24

146
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,880
is capable of carrying eight infantry

147
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,360
however experiences during the soviet

148
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,039
invasion of afghanistan

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,120
showed that this capability didn't work

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
as expected

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
for the soviet mi24 crew members

152
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,039
fighting in afghanistan

153
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,120
both engaging on targets and thinking

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
about the safety of the transported

155
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,440
soldiers

156
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,479
had been too much of a burden besides

157
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,639
carrying eight soldiers and the armor

158
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,240
plates in the troop compartment

159
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,440
decreased the performance of the

160
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,560
helicopter as it increased the weight

161
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
to overcome these problems the soviet

162
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
army started to use mi-24s in fire

163
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
support missions

164
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
and the mi-8s in troop transport

165
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,120
missions

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,720
it has been observed that carrying a

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,479
technician with additional fuel and

168
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,240
ammunition in this compartment

169
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,960
allows the mi 24s to be used longer and

170
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
more effectively

171
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,280
also carrying a technician who handles

172
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
the light machine gun in a window port

173
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,919
was providing the mi24 the ability to

174
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,039
watch its back

175
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,240
while leaving a target area depending on

176
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,039
its model

177
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,280
the mi 24 is equipped with different

178
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,880
weapons

179
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
the mi 24a had a one-man operated

180
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,000
machine

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
gun on its nose the mi 24d

182
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,600
version has a four-barrel 12.7

183
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
millimeter machine gun

184
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,319
mounted for the turret while the mi 24p

185
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,639
model has a 30 millimeter twin barrelled

186
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,080
cannon in a fixed position on its right

187
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
the mi 24 vp has a 23 millimeter twin

188
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
barrel gun

189
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,680
in the beginning the soviet army planned

190
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,599
to use the 9k 114

191
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,840
term anti-tank missiles whose nato

192
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,639
reporting name

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,960
is at6 spiral with the mi 24s

194
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,800
however due to the delay in the

195
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
development of this missile

196
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,479
the helicopter was first equipped with

197
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,880
the three m11 phalanga

198
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,520
yet this missile whose nato reporting

199
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,160
name was

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,560
at2 swatter was obsolete in those years

201
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,039
for this reason many users have equipped

202
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,560
their mi24s with the 9m14 malutka

203
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,880
whose nato reporting name is at3 sagar

204
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
in the following period the helicopter

205
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
has gained the capability of firing the

206
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,319
9k 114 today

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,280
modernized mi24s can use high capability

208
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,479
anti-tank missiles

209
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,840
such as the 9m120 attacker whose nato

210
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,639
reporting name

211
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,639
is at9 spiral 2. the helicopter has a

212
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,160
two-man crew

213
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,840
many countries have also added a

214
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
technician to the crew

215
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,440
the mi 24 can carry eight infantries

216
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,240
the fuselage has a length of 17.51

217
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,800
meters

218
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
and the total length of the helicopter

219
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,680
is 19.79 meters

220
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,960
its rotor diameter is 17.3 meters

221
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,720
while its height is about 5.47 meters

222
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,319
with an empty weight of 7580 kilograms

223
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,440
the maximum takeoff weight is 11 500

224
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,560
kilogram

225
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
two 600 kilowatt tv3 117v

226
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,960
turboshaft engines provide a maximum

227
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,320
speed of 310 kilometers per hour

228
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,399
the cruising speed of the helicopter is

229
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,039
270 kilometers per hour

230
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,159
the mi 24 which has a range of 450

231
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,039
kilometers

232
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,279
can reach a range of 1000 kilometers

233
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,680
with external fuel tanks

234
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,200
its service ceiling is 4950 meters

235
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,120
while its power ceiling is 1400 meters

236
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
as we mentioned earlier the weapons of

237
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,399
the mi 24

238
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,279
differs depending on its models the

239
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,120
helicopter has many production

240
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,160
and modernized variants since it will

241
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,920
take a lot of time to talk about all of

242
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,560
them

243
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,600
we will focus on some major versions

244
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,399
export models of the mi24s are called

245
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,160
mi35

246
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,600
the mi 25 is the simplified and low cost

247
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,080
version

248
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,279
specifically for third world use

249
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,480
the mi 24 super hind mark 3 is the

250
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,399
modernized version of the helicopter

251
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,800
by paramount advanced technologies of

252
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
south africa

253
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,959
this variant has a 20 millimeter vector

254
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,680
f2 gun in a new chin turret

255
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,480
with an external ammunition storage the

256
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
helicopter can fire the long-range

257
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,720
laser guided zt3 ingui anti-tank missile

258
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,279
the super hind mark iv model is equipped

259
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,800
with the ukrainian barrier

260
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,160
anti-tank missile the mi-24vm

261
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,640
has non-retractable landing gear and

262
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
shortened wings

263
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,880
there are two pylons under the wings

264
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
instead of three

265
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,000
this variant has elastomeric bearings

266
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
composite main rotor blades and x-shaped

267
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,079
tail rotor

268
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,440
same as mi-28 the helicopter

269
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
uses a kilimo vk-2502

270
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,040
turboshaft engines which provide better

271
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
high altitude performance

272
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,040
the avionics and electro-optic

273
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,480
surveillance systems

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,920
are also modernized even though the ussr

275
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,160
planned to replace the mi24s with a new

276
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
attack helicopter in the 1970s

277
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,600
due to its low anti-tank capacity it

278
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,480
proved itself

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,519
as indispensable in many battles

280
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,079
the mi-24 was used in combat for the

281
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:42,800
first time

282
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
by ethiopia during the organ war the

283
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,079
helicopters were one of the key weapon

284
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,079
systems for ethiopian victory

285
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,200
over somalia but the mi 24

286
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,279
gained its real reputation during the

287
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,760
soviet invasion of afghanistan

288
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
in the early stages of the war it was a

289
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,360
weapon of terror

290
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,640
for the mujahideen one ceremony 24

291
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
scared a group of mujahideen away by

292
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,560
just maneuvering aggressively

293
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,680
to rescue a company of infantry however

294
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
the helicopter had been out of

295
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
ammunition

296
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,880
besides escorting troop helicopters and

297
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,680
providing air support for ground forces

298
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,880
the mi24s were protecting land convoys

299
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,079
against ambushes the soviet army was

300
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,079
additional using them for hunter killer

301
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,360
operations

302
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,839
the mi 24 hunter kilo groups were

303
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,519
consisting of a minimum of two

304
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,120
helicopters

305
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,680
more often the soviet army preferred the

306
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,560
groups of four

307
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,920
or eight mi24s to provide mutual fire

308
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,120
support

309
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,200
the majority could occasionally counter

310
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
the mi24s with rpg type weapons

311
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,800
and machine guns heavier than 12.7

312
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,160
millimeter

313
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,880
however these efforts were rare and

314
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,480
unproductive

315
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,959
after a while the balances changed with

316
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,880
the stinger and red-eye missiles

317
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,240
that came with the u.s assistance now

318
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,760
it was time for the mi24s to be scared

319
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,120
according to russian sources 27 mi24s

320
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
were shut down by these missiles in

321
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
afghanistan

322
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,560
but western sources estimate that this

323
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
number is much higher

324
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,160
although they were the nightmare of the

325
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,800
iranian infantry during the iran-iraq

326
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,680
war

327
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
the iraqi mi25s were quite insufficient

328
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,680
for anti-attack missions to overcome

329
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,639
this problem

330
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,040
the iraqis started to use them in hunter

331
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,240
killer groups

332
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,639
together with the gazelle carrying the

333
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,320
hot missiles

334
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,480
while the mi25s were dealing with the

335
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,040
infantry and air defense troops

336
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,760
the gazelles were attacking two tanks

337
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,800
during this war

338
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,360
the iraqi mi-25s conducted many

339
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,320
air-to-air helicopter combats

340
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,800
according to some sources during the war

341
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
the heinz claimed 10 victories

342
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,959
against ah ones in exchange of six lost

343
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,079
even once an iraqi mi-24d

344
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,160
managed to shut down an iranian f4

345
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,279
phantom 2

346
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,839
using s5 unguided rockets iraqi mi25s

347
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,480
also claimed 43 kills against other

348
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,839
iranian helicopters

349
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,959
such as uh-ones it is claimed that in

350
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,240
1992

351
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,040
a russian mi24 vp shot down a georgian

352
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,200
su-25 using a 9k 114

353
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,639
anti-tank missile while in the 1980s

354
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,720
many analysts thought that the modern

355
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,639
attack helicopters overshadowed the

356
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,079
mi-24

357
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,480
it has shined brighter once again after

358
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
1990s

359
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
after the end of the first cold war many

360
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,920
african countries

361
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,360
that needed an aircraft for

362
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
counter-insurgency missions

363
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
began to acquire the surplus heinz the

364
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,519
mi 24s

365
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,760
have played important roles in all

366
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
corners of this continent

367
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,480
the mi 24 is still successfully fighting

368
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,519
in africa

369
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,440
as well as afghanistan iraq and syria

370
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
it is an indispensable helicopter in

371
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,199
fact

372
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,120
russia which announced that it would

373
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,519
replace the hind fleet with the mi-28s

374
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,480
and k-52s by 2015

375
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,079
changed this decision the russian mi24s

376
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,279
are being modernized

377
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,279
and will continue to instill fear in

378
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,320
their enemies

379
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,440
for many years to come the helicopter
