00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:04,391
Good morning! We're... here at our breakfast spot!

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,883
Yeah...check it out

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,726
There's Susie, after a bout of mustard hit (Susie finds mustard oil too pungent in food)...

4
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:16,104
She is a little under the weather.

5
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:19,633
So...as you can see, she is having oats.

6
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:25,575
And here is my breakfast as usual, with the speciality of a duck egg...

7
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:30,663
...that comes from ducks that swim around in that pond.

8
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,623
Come! ...come, come!

9
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:45,154
...a 450 year old Vaishnavite monastery, before heading out of Majuli. 

10
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:49,517
Check out our other vlogs on Majuli, if you havenâ€™t already!

11
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,950
There's Susie coming down... with the load...ha...ha

12
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:43,421
As is customary, we had to miss at least one correct turn off. 

13
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:03,053
Dokhinpat Satra was established in the late 1500s, during the Ahom Kings of Assam.

14
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,242
You live here?

15
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:07,847
Aah...yes.

16
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:09,108
How many years?

17
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:17,706
Very nice place.

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,615
Yes.

19
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:36,284
Very big place!

20
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:37,414
Ya, big place.

21
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:42,550
This is where you stay?...These are rooms?

22
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,655
Do you grow some food here?

23
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:50,724
What?

24
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:52,718
Vegetables...growing vegetables?

25
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:58,306
Oh...yes, yes. Somewhat. 

26
00:03:58,637 --> 00:03:59,930
Okay...okay :)

27
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:08,171
Around there they grow some vegetables.

28
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,806
This is the man you met?

29
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:21,395
Yes.

30
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:29,239
Meeting Sri Sri Ramananda Devgoshwami, the Xotradhikar few years back, was a lesson in humility. 

31
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:43,303
From Calcutta...folding system.

32
00:04:56,563 --> 00:05:00,570
Hmm...I didn't think the house itself was made in Calcutta.

33
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,701
I was looking for what was made (in Calcutta) around the house! :)

34
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,301
This is where they stay.

35
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:22,463
Okay!

36
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:28,149
Come, come...come, come!

37
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:34,285
...between humans and animal.

38
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:40,410
Beautiful, ha? ...wow!

39
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,917
Look at that...hmm.

40
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:46,672
This is the...this is called 'Gagori' (Jug for storing liquids).

41
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:28,547
Such a pretty face!

42
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:35,495
Ya, they must get out and about.

43
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,139
Hello beautiful...ooh what a beauty, what a beauty.

44
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:44,055
She likes the pats. :)

45
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,200
Cute bunnies.

46
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:57,000
Hi guys...look at you, how cute you are!

47
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,636
Say something, Mr. Goosie.

48
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,957
If you go near, he'll threaten you. :)

49
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:09,748
Talk to us...'tak, tak' (clicking of tongue)...hmm!

50
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:48,623
...to be part of a unique travel experience!
