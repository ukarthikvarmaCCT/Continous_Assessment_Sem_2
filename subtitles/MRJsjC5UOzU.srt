and here a very important thing here is written

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,060
"Indian Sim Card Only" which means you can only use this in India and not outside India

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,620
so first you user get an Indian Sim card and activate it

40
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,040
So without wasting any time lets unbox this phone

41
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,100
however I don't have a good knife

42
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,660
but I think this can break the seal see what is inside it.
