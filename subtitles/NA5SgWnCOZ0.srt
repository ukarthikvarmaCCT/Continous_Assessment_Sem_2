00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,840
(RECAP)
Welcome to my Silver Play Button party!

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,380
(RECAP)

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,960
Thank you, goodnight, shabbakhair, kailash kher...

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,160
Silver play button = GONE

5
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,520
Yes sir

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,360
The work is done

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,380
Sir, have you seen this man?

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,860
This man has stolen my Button, have you seen him?

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,280
(Forces the suspect to watch Amit Bhadana videos)

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,460
(Forces the suspect to watch Chotu videos)

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,840
(Forces the suspect to watch Saiman Says videos)

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,040
AHHH I'll tell you! Stop it!

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,260
I did not want to steal your Silver Play Button

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,600
Someone made me do it!

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,160
m y
g o d

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,180
Or else why would I steal the Silver play Button of a cringy youtuber like you? Pewdiepie's asslicker!

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,320
And now.

18
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,060
YouTube India's news reporter Neonman:
"I am Neonman and today we are gonna talk about Saiman Says"

19
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,440
"So as some of you might know, 
Saiman Says' Silver Play Button has been stolen"

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,360
"And Saiman has been trying to find it for a month now, but he still hasn't found it."

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,960
"But I have received a big update about Saiman Says' Silver Play Button"

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,460
"Saiman Says' Silver Play Button is in Delhi!"

23
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,260
"Now it will be very interesting to see whether Saiman will go to Delhi and find his Play Button or not"

24
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,800
"I really hope he finds his 
Play Button as soon as possible."

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,000
"And let me know what are your thoughts on this, in the comments section below"

26
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,900
Welcome everybody to Delhi, 
and welcome everybody to Saiman Says.

27
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,920

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,540

and now I have found out that the location of my 
Silver Play Button is somewhere here in Delhi

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,100
Im here in Delhi, and Im not gonna leave Delhi

31
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,620

32
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,720
No.

33
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,680
You haven't?

34
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,720
So Im here in Delhi everybody, and Im trying to find my Silver Play Button, if you see it let me - - -

35
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,460
Who is this vlogging in the middle of the road - - -

36
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,480
Hello everybody, welcome to Chai with Sai

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,820
and im here with my special guest everybody
please welcome, Flying Beast.

38
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,580
The chai will fall down, Sai

39
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,440
Rashi, where is the fan?

40
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,400
Where is the fan, Rashi?

41
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,820
Rasbhari, where is the fan?

42
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,180
You ask Rasbhari where is the fan...
Please ask here where is my Silver Play Button as well?

43
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,340
She'll not tell even if she knows

44
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,040
Where is the fan?

45
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,400
Rashu, do you know where is
Saiman's Silver Play Button?

46
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,340
Good good, dont tell even if you know.
People like him lose their Play Button.

47
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,220
Very good beta, dont show.

48
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,680
Saiman bhai,

49
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
you're finding your Silver Play Button since a month

50
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,200
that theif came from Mumbai to Delhi

51
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,360
that theif must be so hardworking

52
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,560
Yes, the theif has done a lot of mehnat (hardwork)

53
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,860
(Amit Bhadana meme reference)

54
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,080
Now since you have collabed with me, I will put you in my white list. I wont roast you.

55
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,360
Even if you're roasting, roast with love.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,900
No no, I wont roast you.
I'll roast other vloggers, not you.

57
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,620
Yes roast others!

58
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,440
Watch Saiman's channel, I love this guy's style.

59
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,200
A person will die of suffocation, but this guy always keeps the top collar button closed.

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,940
He is very well-cultured. We have cleavage in the neck, he doesn't show that cleavage also.

61
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,280
I urge all mothers and sisters to watch this channel,
very family friendly content.

62
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,740
Plus, I like his shades as well.

63
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,740
Can I try?

64
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,840
Of course!

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,760
Carefully... I dont have another piece.

66
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Carefully...

67
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,160
He's looking so handsome!

68
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,800
Gaurav bhai, hi?

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,080
It seems he has gone into auto-pilot mode.

70
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,240
Sir, please...

71
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,920
Remove it from here

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
How are you, brother

73
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
Everything is fine ...

74
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,440
Are you working or no?

75
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,420
Are you working?
Are you working daily?

76
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,660
Did you do your work today?

77
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,220
Are you working?
Work everyday.

78
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:27,400
I cannot work sir, I have lost my Silver Play Button.
It's here in Delhi, and I cannot find it.
I have lost all hope, I dont know what should i do.

79
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,000
Tell me one thing

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,480
What will the Button give you in life?

81
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,740
If you keep crying, you wont be able to do anything.
Do some work.

82
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,980
Make your next video. You'll get money.

83
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,400
If you get money, you'll get good sleep. If you sleep well, you'll get new ideas to make new videos.

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,300
If you keep cryings, you'll get dark circles.
That's why you wear these shades.

85
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,500
You want your Button, you're not getting it.
You feel you're not happy.

86
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,960
Happiness is in front of you,
this video which you're making. Make people happy.

87
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,040
Happiness is in making content.

88
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,100
Happiness is in making others happy.

89
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,440
there are few channels in our
country which do comedy in a sensible way.

90
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,720
There's sharpness, wit...

91
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,660
A guy is holding his balls and dancing.

92
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,160
Yes we're doing our work. Are my viewers doing their work? Unsubscribe if you aren't! Work!

93
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,240
Dont unsubscribe, he has to earn.

94
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:30,400
Its necessary to have subscribers. 
Everyone who has subscribed to me, 
subscribe to him as well.

95
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,300
Live with love and happiness.

96
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,040
What did you say?
(it sounded like a hindi cuss word)

97
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,460
You come to Delhi and you change your ways

98
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,560
(laughing about a sensitive issue)

99
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,300
This is such a sensitive issue

100
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,640
This is my problem, I get scared to collab with you guys because y'all are so controversial.

101
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,820
We'll cut it.
Timothy, cut it.

102
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,160
Cut it Timothy??? 
Are you making circumcision jokes?

103
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,960
Cut it Timothy???

104
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you Shwetabh bhai.

105
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,360
- Did you get motivated?
- Yes! I did.

106
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Okay so as you know im here in Delhi to search my Silver Play Button, and I can't do this by myself, so I needed some reinforcements.

107
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,500
So everybody please welcome, 
the Delhi wing of Say Sena

108
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,380
I haven't got y'all here to shout "wooo", y'all have to help me search my Play Button!

109
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,540
How do you feel when you meet your fans?

110
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,380
It feels good... I mean who feels bad?

111
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,900
Do you get butterflies in your stomach?

112
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,420
No not butterflies, I get moths.

113
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,840
Do you have a lamp in your stomach?

114
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,380
Can I borrow your shades?

115
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,560
Just dont see my dark circles...

116
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,340
Oh my god!!! Timothy!!!

117
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,920
Who do you think has stolen my Silver play button ?

118
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,400
Who is the top suspect?

119
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,740
Gulshan Kumar

120
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,500
T-Series

121
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,600
pls help me to find the Play Button :(((

122
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,640
Bakchod Baba, Amit Bhadana, T-Series Carryminati...

123
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,040
Yes even Modi Ji

124
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,840
- I need a thumbnail
- You want thumbnail? Take.

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,340
(Singing Amit Bhadana's song)

126
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,500
How do you feel so many people have 
come to see Timothy?

127
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,460
Everyone say Hi to Timothy

128
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,820
You've always spoken about Pewdiepie,
but what do you think about Marzia?

129
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,380
She is my bhabhi (sister-in-law)

130
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,380
His taste is so good at such a young age.

131
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,300
Who is Timothy?

132
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,320
You people have crowded me so much, 
he couldn't hear anything

133
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,240
I've come from far away to meet you I thought I'll be late

134
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Dont worry you're not late, we are here

135
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,000
What did you ask?

136
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,240
Who is Timothy?

137
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,000
That I cannot answer

138
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,300
Thank you everybody

139
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,440
All Delhi SaySena members are here, thank you

140
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,600
What happened? Any problem?

141
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,860
You're roasting a lot, aren't you?

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,420
You do a lot of roasting, right?

143
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,640
You've come from Mumbai, you're my guest.
I won't let you go back empty handed.

144
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,500
Amit sir has returned my Silver Play Button

145
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,260
Timothy, Amit sir.
Amit sir, Timothy.

146
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
How are you Timothy?

147
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,040
You have such long hair, such long height...

148
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Thank you Amir sir for giving me my Play Button back

149
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,040
They know this is all scripted.
Now chill, and just keep it.

150
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,280
-How was the food?
-Food was great

151
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,660
Keep working.
I want the youtube community to grow like this.

152
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,940
New creators should keep coming, keep creating.

153
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,400
There is no enemity between any youtubers, we're here to just entertain.

154
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,320
Then don't show so much entertainment only on me.
There are others as well...

155
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
For how long will you keep getting views on my name?

156
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,580
Delete it! Put a strike on it!

157
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,060
You shouldn't be surrounded by yes-men.
Criticism is a good thing.

158
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
But it shouldn't come from you.

159
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:58,540
Thank you so much. Keep loving keep supporting. Support Saiman. Take care.
